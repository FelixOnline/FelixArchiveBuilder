    "content": "REVIEWS I BERLIN/ RED RINSE\nUnion Concert Hall\nIt would seem logical to start with the\nsupport band, who, due to the Time Flies\nsplitting up on the evening prior to this\ngig, turned out to be a four piece band\ncalled Red Rinse, who appeared on stage\ncomplete with washing line. Right from\nthe very beginning they brought back\nmemories of Slade, though a little more\nserious in their attitude to the music, and\nin some respects lacking the polish that\nSlade had. The numbers were all fairly\ntight, short, and gave the impression that\nthe band had come from a wo/king class\nbackground, especially when singing\nabout subjects such as 'I talk like that'. I couldn't help feeling that this particular\noutfit would be more suited to playing the\npub scene than support to a heavy metal\nband, though in fairness they were better\nthan some support acts I 've seen at\nHammersmith. Talking of being more\nsuited to pubs, they tell me that they can\nbe found most Saturday evenings in a new rock venue in East Acton, the Oak\nTree Public House on Westway. One\nnumber that they didn't play that would\nhave gone done well was You Can't Keep\nA Good Drum Kit Down. One final,\nthough I wonder what image this band\nwould have chosen in 1978?\nBerlin started as they meant to go on,\nand immediately it became apparent that\nthere was something out of place. (I eventually worked out what it was, I could actually see this group, not\nsomething that I usually can from the\nback of the circle of the Hammersmith\nOdeon, where I usually go to see groups\nlike this.) The music was excellent,\nmarred only by occasional feedback, and\ngave the impression of good, 'classic',\nheavy metal, very professionally put over,\nwith some excellent guitar throughout the\nset. The style of lighting employed\nreminded me of Rush last year, and\nalthough I kept expecting to see clouds of\ndry ice, unfortunately it never came. One\nthing I did like about the group was the\nuse of two guitars, though unfortunately\ntheir use in harmony can only be really\nappreciated with the use of st ero. headphones. Personal favourite of the\nevening had to be Lady Of Mars. I could\nsum the concert up in one word, but\nmodesty prevents me, however, if you did\nmiss them, well tough, I'm just hoping\nthat they're on vinyl later this year\n(rumour has it they could be on a future\n'Metal For Muthas' album, though they\nwill have to change their name as there is\nalready a Berlin on record at present. A name change has one advantage, when\nyou take out a mortgage to see them at\nWembley in two years, you won't feel so\nbad that you missed them at IC, because\nyou won't immediately make the connection between the two names). Once final comment, the concert was one of\nthose you come out thinking, \" Why haven't they released a live album?\"\nShep\nTHE16 TONS TOUR Lewisham Odeon\nIt was family night out at the Lewisham\nOdeon, with Punk, Country and Western,\nRhythm and Blues, Reggae and tearing\nthe roof off the Lewisham Odeon.\nFirst on was Blast Furnace Revenge\nwith their own style of driving rhythm and\nblues (the blue wave), they were fairly\ngood and played one outstanding slow\nblues number, the other high spot being\nCan't Stop The Boy, an old song from\nthe days when they were Blast Furnace\nAnd The Heatwaves. Then it was time for\nJamaican toaster Mikey Dread to give out\nsome sharp talking over a background of\nrockers' rebel music. Next on was Joe Ely\n(and his band) who, as far as I can tell, is\nsupposed to be some kind of 'New Wave\nCowboy' from Texas. He played fairly\nconventional rock and although he was\nthe better side of average, I won't lose\nany sleep if I never see him again. After\nhim came more tall toasts and deep dubs\nfrom Mikey Dread. Then, to the strains of\nShift Sixteen Tons/And What Do You\nGet/Another Day Older/And Deeper In\nDebt (hence Sixteen Tons Tour), the\nClash took the stage and fired up with\nClash City Rockers. All clad in black\nshirts and trousers they were visually\ngreat, although I prefer the leather\njackets, zips, parachute suits, etc, of the\nWestway Guerillas. Musically they were\nthe best I 've ever heard them live, ie, only\none guitar packed in and Strummer kept\nhis voice throughout. They played superlative versions of Train In Vain,\n(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais and\nCapitol Radio as well as playing a fair\nselection of singles and album tracks from\nall three albums. They worked hard on\nstage, putting their all into the set, as\nalways. Keyboards were played by\nBlockhead Mickey Gallagher, who seems\nto now be the fifth member of the Clash.\nHowever, the Clash didn't appear as\nthreatening or subversive as they have\ndone on past occasions, seeming to\nexpect favourable audience reaction,\nwhich, whilst you expect that from duff\ndisco bands like Pink Floyd or Genesis, is\nworrying coming from the Clash. The\nClash unfortunately have an unenviable\nchoice to make, either to pander to the\ntastes of the morons who shout White\nRiot throughout the set, or to be really\nradical and uncompromising and risk\nlosing support. I came away knowing that\nI'd seen a fine band play a fine concert,\nbut nagging doubts persisted. People are\nstarting to say that the Clash will be the\n'Rolling Stones of the '80s' \u2014 I'd rather\nthey broke up now than for that to\nhappen to them.\nTOO MUCH PRESSURE LP THE SELECTOR The det iut album from the Selector and\nit is another Two-Tone joyous killer that\nconsists of whooping ska and English\nreggae. When I saw Selector on the TwoTone tour I was impressed by them and\nhaving listened to this album, I'm even\n\u2022more impressed.\nThere are thirteen songs on the album\nwhich are all played very well the overall\nsound is very tight. The best of the album\nis represented by They Make Me Mad,\nMissing Words, Street Feeling, My Collie\n(Not A Dog), Too Much Pressure, Out\nOn the Streets and Carry Go Bring\nCome which are so good that they are\nfrightening. The rest of the songs are also\nvery good. The band have got a stunning\ninsight on real life, which they are able to\nput across without talking down or\npreaching to you. The flying horn section\nof Dick Cauthell and Rico also turn up on\nthe album. Rico's been in reggae and ska\nsince it started and it's nice to see him\ngetting fame and fortune through the\nSpecials, the Selector and Linton Kwesi\nJohnson.\nWell, another near perfect release from\nTwo-Tone which warms the heart. If you\nare still dumb enough to think the Two\nTone bands are Secret Affair type\nmindless mods, do some rethinking \u2014\nthese are Rude boys and girls who are\ninventive rather than regressive. This is\nreal music by real people.\nSimon Jerome\n10\n\n"

    "content": "LETTERS Dear Colin\nWe are disgusted with the\nattitude of most IC students,\nwho as far as we can make out\nare a load of hypocritical\nw?????s. A few people give up a lot of their time to organise\nentertainment for these people\nwho seem to expect it as their\nGod given right to have it. Then\ndon't bother to turn up on the\nnight to experience it before\npassing judgment.\nFor instance, take last week's concert by Berlin in the Concert\nHall: a lot of effort and time went\ninto putting on the show; not\nonly on the Friday afternoon and\nevening, but also through the\npreceding weeks to get all the\nbureaucracy, etc, in order. Is not\na kick in the c???h. This is not as\nif you are cramped in a sweaty\nsleazy dung heap like Nashville\nor Marquee (where you also get\nripped ott tor drinks even worse\nthan Mooney).\nBy the way, the band played\nexcellently and everyone really\nenjoyed themselves; I predict\nthat they will be a great success,\nas in the general tradition of\nbands who have played in the\nConcert Hall (Def Leppard, Jane\nAire, Girlschool, After The Fire,\n999, XTC, Horslips, Burlesque,\nEnid (who have played here\ntwice), to name but a few.\nYou P? r???r???s are always\nasking for more bands, but\nwhat you mean is 'well known'\nbands like Genesis, Yes, Led\nZeppelin, etc; Well, face up to the\nfacts, in London they prefer/no,\nrequire to play the larger halls...\nWembley, Hammy Odeon, Earl's Court, because the promoter\nhas to cover his costs. Imagine\nputting on a band who need to fill\nout the Odeon at \u00a37.00 a ticket to\ncover costs being put on in the\nGreat Hall \u2014 the costs would be\nover \u00a320.00 a ticket... you seem\nto have enough trouble forking\nout \u00a31.00, let alone \u00a320.00!\nIf for a change, you come\nup with some constructive,\nrather than destructive, criticism, we will be more than\nhappy to listen and possibly act\nupon your suggestions.\nNever was so much done by so\nfew for so many and gone\nunappreciated.\nYours sincerely\nMike Furmston\nIan Davidson\nBrian Cresswell\nSteve Wolff\nTooy Clark\nDear Colin\nOne of our (Islamic) society\nmembers noticed the use of\n'God, Allah, Mao, Buddha' in\nthe table tennis article in\nFELIX( issue 544). I want to\npoint out two points. Firstly,\nAllah is an Arabic word Ali-Tah\nand is the name given to the\nonly God we believe exists and\nsecondly, we do not associate\nwith Allah any other God; as\nthis forms one of the foremost\nprinciples in our religion \u2014 ie,\nthe Oneness of God. Our religion teaches that we\nbe tolerant to all others, as\nlong as they do not misrepresent\nIslam or try to de story it. I suggest that the use of Islamic\nterms (widely misrepresented in\nnational newspapers) be limited\nto those who will not offend our\nprinciples( intentionally or unintentionally).\nYours Y ElSa ie The Peace of God be upon\nthose who follow the correct\npath.\nDear Roger\nBelow is a letter I have sent\nto Paul Segal, News Editor of\nLondon Student newspaper,\nwith reference to an incorrect\nstory carried by them on\nWednesday.\nDear Paul\nI was interested to read in\nthis week's London Student\nthat a motion calling for a referendum on NUS affiliation,\nproposed by myself as \"one of\nthe two vice presidents at\nImperial\", was passed at a Union meeting on Tuesday.\nUnfortunately, there appear\nto be some factual inaccuracies\nin this report which I would like\nto correct.\n(i) Imperial has three vice\npresidents.\n(ii) I am not one of them.\n(iii) The motion on NUS was\nproposed by Chris Webb and\nseconded by myself.\n(iv) THAT THE MEETING ON TUESDAY WAS DEEMED IN QUO RATE BEFORE ANY VOTE COULD BETAKEN. As I am sure you are aware,\nthis is not the first time Imperial\nhas been mis reported in London\nStudent. You may also remember that last term we were\nthe first college to go into\noccupation in protest at the\nproposed increases in overseas\nstudents tu it ii on fees, but\nSennet (as you then were) did\nnot appear to consider this to\nbe of sufficient importance to\neven mention it.\nI would also like to ask how\nit is possible for London Student\nto send a reporter to our Union\nMeeting on Tuesday (which\nended up at 1:30pm) and have an\narticle written, typeset and pasted up, and the whole paper\nprinted, collated, and distributed\nin time for me to be shown one at\n7:00pm ON THE SAME DAY? To produce and distribute a paper reporting an event which\noccurred a mere five and a half\nhours previously is a staggering\nfeat which you are to be congratulated on.\nPerhaps it would in addition be\npossible for things to be correctly\nreported in future?\nYours sincerely\nMalcolm Brain\nDeputy President\nImperial College Union\nDear Colin\nThe article about the TwentyF our Hour Pedal Car Race at\nBristol in FELIX545 so incensed\nme by its total bias to C&G that I have decided to write this letter.\nRather than giving my immediate\nreaction, I have decided to wait\nuntil the official results have been\nreceived from Bristol so that I may give a balanced account of\nthe event.\nTo begin with, four teams\nwere entered by IC. Two each\nfrom RS M and C&G, a mens and\nladies team in each case. During\nthe race itself all teams suffered\ngreatly from breakdowns. The\nRS M cars both suffered fractured cranks, the men's steering\nbroke twice, punctures were\nincur r red on both cars and the\nladies car suffered a fracture of\nits main feature \u2014 this resulting\nin a pit-stop for repairs of three\nand three quarter hours. Certainly Guilds had problems too;\nwith the pedals on the mens' car\nand the steering of the ladies' car;\nbut to say that this cost them the\nrace was ludicrous. There was\nnever any question of the team\nbeating Rolls-Royce Coventry and nor would there have been if\nthe car had been working perfectly. In past years, all cars\nhave run without problems (as I know from personal experience)\nand although Guilds have had a much better position, they still\nhave come nowhere near RR. Guilds ladies did pedal magnificently. They had problems with\nthe car and through sheer determination came through to\nwin the title. I would point out\nthat in all previous ladies competitions Mines have won the title and should the car have\nnot required extensive repairs\nI'm sure the RS M would have\ngiven Guilds a run for their money \u2014 though I feel bound to\nsay I think Guilds ladies would\nstill have won. Mines ladies made\nthe very best of a bad job (my\nfault) and considering the very\ngreat problems they encountered, performed very respectably (Bristol's comments \u2014 not\nmine). The final results from\nBristol were:\nMines A( men): 897 (20th) Mines B( ladies) 563 (33rd) Guilds A( men) 737 (30th) Guilds B( ladies) 892 (21st) In comparison Rolls Royce( Coventry) A:1,233. The total\ndistance covered by all competitors was 8,280 miles (there\nwere 39 teams in all).\nAs you can see the picture is\nvery different to that painted by\nthe article in question. I would\nhave thought that it was the\nresp on sib lit y of the FELIX personnel to give a balanced\nreport by checking out both\nsides of a story and to cease this\nexasperating bias to C&G. Yours Richard Turner\nMines Chief Engineer\nActing Ed's Comment: It is an\nincorrect myth that FELIX\npersonnel are on hand to cover\nall events. FELIX relies on\narticles from you, the students. It\nis not just here fora few to learn\nthe skills of journalism. Hence,\nMr Turner, it would have been\nbetter for you to write this\ninformation, which we are\ngrateful for, last week. A Guilds'\nperson did and I accept that the\narticle was slanted towards\nGuilds. The Bristol Pedal Car\nRace was a great triumph for the\nC&G Ladies' team and so was\nright to get full recognition in\nFELIX.\nFOR SALE One circle ticket for Peter Gabriel,\nHammersmith Odeon, March 13th. \u00a33.00.

    "content": "CHESS: IC1 vs Centymca\nWith only one win in five matches\nthis season, IC1 needed a good result\nagainst Centymca, last year's champi-ons, to keep clear of the regulation\nzone. However, ou f chances of\nwinning looked slight as the opposition\nheavily out graded us on most of the\neight boards.\nUsually chess matches are rather\nslow (and boring?) affairs lasting well\nover three hours, so it was a bit- of a sensation when two of the games finished within twenty minutes. Pete\nAnderson, on board three, forsaking\nhis favourite Queen Pawn opening, lost a six move game in just ten\nminutes(!) while Julian Bacon took\njust twice as long to crush his bemused opponent. Unfortunately\nnormality returned and the prospect of\nan early exodus to the Union Bar\nfaded as the next game did not finish\nfor another two hours.\nFrom very early on, it was evident\nthat Centymca were much stronger on\nthe top boards but the games were\nmore evenly matched lower down. On board two, Jon Freeman quickly lost a pawn and was struggling from then on\nwhile Phil Maguire, on the top board,\nplayed passively in the opening and\nsoon had a difficult position. Things\nwere going much better on the bottom\nboards; on board seven, Jitesh Gajjar\nobtained a strong position from the\nopening and Chris Callow, on board\neight, was able to snatch the initiative\nwith a strong Kingside attack. Brian\nTang produced a bold piece sacrifice,\non board four, and looked set for a good win but Bob Coles struggled\nagainst an unusual opening set-up\nand was soon in trouble.\nJi tesh duly pressed home his advantage and soon forced his\nopponent to resign. Chris Callow smashed open his opponent's Kings ide with a well calculated Rook sacrifice leaving himself with an easy\nwin. This gave IC a31 lead but Jon and Bob soon put paid to that; Jon decided that losing one pawn wasn't bad enough and proceeded to lose\nanother three, leaving him four pawns\ndown in a lost end game. On four,\nBob never recovered from his poor\nopening play and was well beaten.\nThis left the score level at 3-3 with\ntwo games unfinished. Brian Tang,\nunfortunately, failed to convert his\nearly advantage and had to be content\nwith a draw. Thus the IC Captain now\nneeds to draw his game to save the\nmatch. He missed an easy drawing\nline but has adjourned in only a slightly inferior position which he\nshould be able to hold. So hopefully,\nthe match s hold finish as a44 draw\ngiving IC a well deserved half point.\nTeam: P Maguire, J Freeman, P Anderson, B Tang, R Coles, J Bacon,\nJ Gajjar and CT Callow.\nP Maguire\nIC SAILING\nIC Sailing Club entered two teams\nin the Castaways Cup this weekend, in\nwhich London Colleges and Hospitals\ncompeted. Both teams were undefeated\nagainst the other nine teams and IC A team beat IC B team in the preliminary\nleague. Sunday saw a wet, cold day with\na slight breeze and both IC teams\nqualifying for the final. Two races were\nheld; the first being won by IC B team\nholding second, third and forth positions and with two and a half penalty\npoints against IC A. In the second race,\nIC A team took first, second and third\npositions on the line, but two incidents\ninvolving Alan Beany and Dave Derby,\nand Alan Be any and Ian Robson occured, resulting in two protests. A committee was set up and in its first\nhearing disqualified both Alan Beany\nand Dave Derby and in its second disqualified Ian Robson. Thus after an\nafternoon of drama, IC B team took the\nhonours by three points.\nA team: D Derby, D Cul shaw, I Robson, G Titmus, and N Ajderian.\nB team: J Williams, A Beany, C Lewis,\nA Turnbull/C Jaffey, J Baxter and K Andrews.\nBALDWIN HAT TRCK\nCLINCHES IT FOR IC\nAfter George Adach's failure to sign\nKevin Keegan and the previous 9-1\ndefeat by Guys Hospital left the sixths\nmorale at a low ebb. With the absence\nof such household names as Dave\nBradley, Ismael Sola, Steve Davies and\nGary Slater it looked as though the\nsixths would be left to scrape up a team again. In fact this was not the\ncase, as five ' imported superstars'\nfrom other teams came to the rescue\nand played an invaluable part in IC's win.\nThe game was even to begin with\nand both sides created some half\nchances. Then, from Pete Curzon' s pin-pointed corner a lovely header by\nMark Clegg put IC into the lead. This\ngoal provoked some consistent attacking football from St Georges which\nwas rebuffed by IC's solid defence and\ngood goal keeping by Richard Rijnbeek.\nIC then took the initiative and after a period of constant pressure, Sean Coyle\nhassled a defender so that he misjudged\nhis back pass and the ever alert Ken\nBaldwin was on hand to score. Ken\nBaldwin pounced a few minutes later\nwhen the St Georges' goalkeeper failed\nto hold a shot. Ken's hat trick soon\nfollowed from a particularly good IC\nmove.\nIn the second half Nigel Audin (the\nfirst half referee) replaced Ken Baldwin\nwho had an ankle injury. From the start\nof this half, St Georges piled on the\npressure and scored when a melee in the\ngoal mouth resulted in George Adach\nappearing to kick the ball into his own\nnet, however, this was later denied( mainly by George). He later made amends for this by kicking the ball off\nthe line when a goal looked certain.\nDuring this period of pressure IC\ncounterattacked and Sean Coyle scored a superb solo goal. St Georges\nsoon scored again when a back-pass\nwent astray but IC were never in danger\nof conceding any more.\nTeam: G Adach (Capt), R Rijnbeek, P Curzon, Liam, PGa hil, S Coyle, D Timbler, Bob, D Kelly, M Clegg and K Baldwin (N Audin).\nTABLE TENNIS\nLast week was undeniably the nadir\nof the season( that means bottom, bunk heads!) for the firsts. Standing imperiously atop division four (with\nten points clear) and favourites for the\nMinor League Knock-Out Cup, they\nmet Fulham4, a team which the fourths had defeated63 only a fortnight ago. What happened? I'm still\nasking that myself. Actually, it was 5-4 the wrong way, out of the cup, and\nthe over confident firsts (never short\nof my praises all season), played some\nof the slackest, least aggressive table\ntennis ever seen since the last time I played!\nIC 4 vs SAINSBURY2:90 An excellent win over the second\nplaced division 6a side, putting us into\nthat spot \u2014 divisional play-off here we\ncome.\nIC 4 vs CITY UNIV: 7-2\nThe home defeat of last term (due to\nmy brilliant team selection?) was finally avenged, but I tried hard to give\nthem a double over us. Lars and Max\nwon three sets each, I lost two (I had\na cold).\nThe thirds annihilated (I like these\npowerful expressive words, let's use\nanother one . . . ) nay, conquered yet\nanother measly obstacle to their cup\nhopes, Gainsford 4 by 9-0. Truck on!\nEarlier, both the seconds and firsts\nhad also won their most recent league\nmatches (God knows how the firsts\nwon).\nThe club will soon, ie this team, be\nholding elections for next year's officials, an cf don't forget that we have\nETTA professional coaching every\nMonday between 7:00pm and 9:00pm in the table tennis room. Approximate\ncost fifty pence.\nFinally this week, a mention of the\nUL U table tennis team. I don't normally\nmention them, in fact never, because for\nat least the last two years they've\nkidnapped our best players \u2014 hence^we\nstruggle along in div s four, five and six;\nbut at least with two thirds IC players,\ntheir first team is second in the Central\nLeague \u2014 division one; pretty smart,\nhuh?\nIf you missed Salam' s lecture on\nMonday, you really deserve to be\nreading this article.\nUntil I get the NobelPrize for Literature, farewell!\nPete Laureate\n11\n\n"

    "content": "REVIEWS9 HH HII suppose it is just possible that is has\nescaped your notice that there is an IC\nENTS gig this coming Sunday (2nd March).\nAlbertos Y Los Trios Paranois, in case\nyou didn't know, have changed their\nname to the Charlie Parkas. This, I gather\nis partly due to the death of one member\nand the leaving of another, and also due\nto a change in musical direction. Well, I don't know about that, but I do know\nthat they have always been great to listen\nto and expert satirists. In fact their satire\ntranscends the raw material itself, they\nhave been known to precede fashion and\nthey were making punks look silly before\nanyone had heard of the Sex Pistols.\nTheir stage show, Snuff Rock, featuring\nNorman Sleak, produced what must go\ndown in history as the best punk EP ever\nmade: Snuff Rock. This featured one\ntrack of completely mind boggling excellence Kill. One minute and twenty-nine seconds of pure TNT, it stands as\nthe ultimate punk song, even though it is\napis stake.\" I'm gonna cut me liver out\nand shove it in your face\", sums it up\nfairly well, although it is impossible to\ndescribe listening to it properly without\nresorting to hitting oneself on the head\nwith a large and heavy piece six inches of\nKings Road punk skin.\nPunk, however, is now pass e and so\nthese fun-filled fellows have turned their\nattention to Mod.\nThis tour, the 'March Of The Slobs'\ntour is obviously a poke at the much-publicised Mod revival, and their new\nsingle Robin Hood, has once again proved\nthey can hit the mark better than anyone.\nAfter all, we've had ska versions of old\nsongs like Tears Of A Clown so why not\nRobin Hood?\nI leave it to your imagination to what it\nsounds like, although you can hear it on\nthe radio if you know when to listen, or\nelse I'm certain you'll get a much better\nimpression if you see it done live, this\nSunday, Imperial College, Great Hall. Get\nyour tickets now boys and girls, or you'll\nbe sorry.\nOf course there is one other good\nreason for going to Sunday's concert, the\nwonderful scintillating support group.\nFELIX\nlooks\nforward to\nthe Ents gig\n\u2022 Jmpej-i ul Culls \u00bb \u00ab ERT Sl MM \u00bb I* \u2022 \u2022 it \u2014\nRosemary/ with\nAlbertos\nLos Trios\nParanois\nY The Smirks\nI refer of course to the SMIRKS. Yes, this little-known Manchester band have\nhad no less than four singles, all highly\nrated by John Peel, and two of them NME singles of the week. They have been\nsigned to Beserkely (Johnathan Richman's label), and Virgin, and yet still the success, fame and glory they deserve eludes them. We the converted therefore\nfeel obliged to tell you, the world, what\nyou're missing.\nThe band's down to earth style of\nhumour shows through in most of their\nsongs, and they have proved their flexibility many times, playing blues, pop,\nreggae and rock with equal ease and flair.\nTheir first and probably most well-known\nsingle was OK UK, an unlikely song written in praise of this country over such fashionable places as California, viz:\n\"California heartache gets on my wick,\nAnd the kids that sing about it make me\nsick,\nI'm OK where I am,\nOK OK\"\nThe vocals are flawless and handled\nmainly by Simon Milner, the lead singer.\nBacked by the rest of the group it comes out sounding fresh and vibrant, combined with the witty style it has that extra something that should spell success in\neight foot letters. Almost everyone I know who has ever seen them live has become\nan ardent fan (I 've seen them three times\nin London alone), so my advice to you is\ndon't miss them or you'll miss out. They'll\nbe very big one day soon and you'll love\nto say \" Oh yes they played at my college\nonce before they were famous!\"\nLeigh Foster\nLP REVIEW\nGroup 8 of the Periodic Table\nlives on, due to \u2014 Various\nArtists \u2014 Metal for Muthas \u2014\nEMI EMC3318 Not that you really need the catalogue\nnumber, as this LP is destined for the\ncharts. A compilation of new and not easily\navailable material compiled by EMI's A&Rb off in, Ashley Goodall, with the aid of Heavy\nMetal sound house DJ, Neal Kay, who\nwrites the eloquent sleeve notes, which is\nfitting since he is partly responsible for the\nsuccess of Praying Mantis and Iron Maiden,\nthe latter contributing the first track,\nSanctuary. An excellent start this proves to\nbe; quick, powerful and with effective guitar\nbreaks and those contrasts in volume that\nsend a shiver down your spine. Paul\nDi'Anno's vocals elevate the standard of the\nsong enormously. It is followed by\nSledgehammers's Sledgehammer, the most\ncommercial of the songs, since it has a tune\nwhich refuses to leave your head. The EF Band's Fighting For Rock And Roll, starts\npromisingly and develops into a song that\nseems too fast. Productionwise the guitar\nsounds too distant, and the track has an\nunwelcome continental feel to it. Toad the\nWet Sprocket's Blues In A, would have been\nbetter suited to an Elton John LP. It is\nlethargic and uninspiring although competently performed. This is more than\nmade up for by Praying Mantis' Captured\nCity. Mantis were in the shadow of Iron\nMaiden, and although less experienced, are\njust as promising. The track is equip ppe d with devastating harmonies; not an amp\nblower, but one of the best tracks on the LP. The vocal accent is delightful, especially on\nthe word \"city\". Lyrically meaningful, it is\nthe most refined track on the LP, and also\nthe longest, but still not long enough.\nSide two begins with Fight Back, by Ethel\nthe Frog, and an accent problem, or is it the\nrecording? A good song, but not loud\nenough. A spooky start, courtesy of\nAngelwitch introduces, Baphomet, a Black\nSabbathy song, pretty good all the same.\nBack to the professionals, the next three\ntracks make the album a4V2 star rer( out of\n5). Iron Maiden's Wrathchild, is solid class,\nand the band's confidence overflows.\nThen, a piano intro, and the sound of\nRadio 2 builds up to Samson's Tomorrow\nOr Yesterday. Cultured but still heavy, the\nsong shows signs of being structured, and\nthe formula works well. The last, and best\ntrack is Nutz's Boot/ig gers, Spanish guitar\ntype solo a la Van Halen, then into a sheet of\nsound. Vocals are vaguely rem in scent of the\nlate Bon Scott, the feeling put into the word,\n\"boot lig ger\" is perfect. Professional and an\nexcellent curtain closer.\nThe record is available at the maximum price of \u00a33.99, and on offer goes as low as\n\u00a32.99, and with every playing gets better.\nJulian Pitt\nPS: Never judge an LP by its cover!\n9\n\n"

    "content": "DEBATE ON OVERSEAS AID The house suggests that the\nWestern countries hinder the\nprogress of developing countries\nDepending on what you mean by\n'progress', ie, economic development,\neducation, and industry, Trevor Phillips\n(ex IC Union President, now President of\nNUS) put over his motion in a strong,\nhumorous and fluid way, hardly pausing\nfor breath as he interjected facts,\nand statistics with personal viewpoints.\nThe West hindered the East, or, as he\nput it, the North hindered the South by\nlending money (in meagre proportions) on\nthe one hand, only to demand enormous\nrepayment of interest, causing the Third\nWorld to be totally beholden to the West.\nMr Phillips, although careful to point\nout that his sentiments did not entirely lie\nwith Communist regimes, pointed to\nChina and Russia as prime examples of\n'impoverished' count i res who, without any\naid from the West, developed independently\n(a red herring to be picked up later by the\nopposition).\nUndetered by the face-pulling and note-passing tactics adopted by the other side, he\ncould well have continued to illustrate his\npoint past the generous time limit allowed by\nMr Robertson, Chairman, who had\nintroduced the debate by describing himself\nas \"possibly a little bit of aid\" having worked\nin a Third World country for nine years. \" A Liberal\" he hastened to add.\nRevenge for the \"off-putting\" tactics came\nto Trevor Phillips when Martin Stevens, MP for Fulham, stood up to speak against the\nmotion. Out came the worry beads, \"and\ndespite Mr Phillips' calm countenance, the\nbeads had the desired effect of being more\nfascinating than Mr Stevens's speech.\nMr Stevens pointed to several examples\nof countries who had almost pleaded to be\nre-included under British rule, which, let's face it, had provided aid in the form of\neducation and trade. If it hadn't been for the\nBritish, the Indians and Egyptians wouldn't be producing cotton goods now. How easy\nit was to ob tana glass of milk in Russia\nbecame a case in point: \"Very difficult,\" said\nMr Stevens. \"Quite easy,\" stated Martin\nLockett, seconding the motion. \" Ah, but did\nyou take your own glass?\" retorted Mr\nStevens. Mr Lockett managed to steer the\ndebate back to the hindrance of foreign aid\nby some impressive facts, and a concise\nsumming-up of what was becoming a somewhat vague outline of the motion.\nLast to speak against the motion was Mr\nAlbert Barnafo, a Social and Economic\nStudies student. His carefully prepared\nspeech was delivered with great conviction\nand an even greater number of statistics,\nsome of which appeared to be of more use\nto his opponents, particularly one pertaining\nto aid getting into the wrong hands and\nbeing used to buy houses for the daughters\nof Nigerian government ministers; as good a reason as any, I thought, not to give it in the\nfirst place.\nThe floor was itching to make comments,\nspeeches, accusations and agreements but\ntime was short, and a debate that could have\ncontinued long into the afternoon, judging\nby the excitement generated, had to be\ncurtailed, with just time for a vote in the\nclosing minute.\nNeedless to say, Trevor Phillips and Co speaking on the motion, won by a large\nmajority, although I tend to think that the\nconvictions of the audience lay strongly with\nthe motion and Mr Phillips anyway, prior to\nthe debate.\nJaqie Kingham\nLONDON STUDENT DRAMA FESTIVAL An enterprising and innovative scheme, the\nLondon Student Drama Festival sponsored\nby the Evening News is drawing to a close.\nThis agglomeration of events was designed\nbasically to bridge the gap between various\nstudent dramatic societies and professional\nacting and comprised a large number of\nperformances of various plays and\ntheatrical workshops at various times of the\nday in the Collegiate Theatre, Gordon\nStreet. Scheduled to run for twelve days, a little spice was added by offering prizes and\ngetting a few famous names to volunteer\ntheir expertise. On paper it's been a very\ngood idea, being as far-reaching as involving\na group of borst al inmates in a dramatic\nproduction.\nIn practice the organisers more than likely\nfound most trouble in public ising the\nfestival; with their festival offices in the UL U building, Malet Street, they suffer from the\nold. Droblem of being too far removed\nfrom other centres of student life. I doubt\nthat many people at IC knew of the\nexistence of the festival, let alone had any\nplans to participate or spec tate. If you look\ncarefully, maybe you'll see their posters and\nthen again maybe you won't. Perhaps the fault lies inthe lack of any\nnetwork through which to pass\ninformation, which is a great shame having\nsen the small band of enthusiastic coordinators in the Festival offices, They were\nall very busy sending out information and\npublicity, but it might save them a lot of time\nand effort if they could check exactly what\neffect it was having. In the meantime if we\nhear about any more manifestations of\nhistrionics, we'll let you know.\nLars Wernberg-Moller\nELECTION HUSTINGS\n1.00pm Thursday 6th of March\nGreat Hall\nCome and judge for yourself.\nPRESIDENT DEPUTY PRESIDENT\nHON.SECRETARY FELIX EDITOR\nLECTURES CANCELLED TILL 3.30PM VOTING IN ALL DEPARTMENTS\non Monday 10th and Tuesday 11th of\nMarch 10.00am to 5.00pm.

    "content": "Tuesday saw the publication of the report of\nthe working party on medical and dental\nteaching resources. The working party, chaired\nby the Lord Flowers, Rector of Imperial\nCollege, recommends that the thirty-four\nseparate medical and teaching institutions in\nLondon should be regrouped into six new\nschools of medicine and dentistry.\nThis would involve closing Westminster\nHospital medical school and several other\nLondon medical institutes. The Editor of FELIX\ninterviewed two third year medical students\nfrom Westminster who had just returned from\na demonstration outside the University of\nLondon.\nThey had been shouting slogans: \"Some\nFlowers smell but this one stinks\", etc. Both\nBBC and ITN gave extensive coverage to the\nLord Flowers press conference and the\nmedical student demonstrations. An interview\nwith the Lord Flowers was the lead item on the\nBBC 5:40 news. The nurses at St Stephen's gave a cool response to the Lord Flowers'\nstatement, \"Although the hospitals don't like\nthe way the cutbacks affect their backyard . . .\nthey will accept it.\" The nurses resolved not to\nallow the report to be easily accepted.\nThe Dean of Westminster, Dr John Wyman,\nhas told the medical students that \"the hands\nof the authorities at Westminster are tied, but\nthe students have the opportunity to be free to\nprotest.\" The Westminster Medical School\nCOLIN' S EDITORIAL Was the FELIX Editor's accident specially timed to coincide\nwith the publication of the Flowers' Report on Medical and Dental\nresources? No,I might be over enthusiastic to get news pictures,\nbut I draw the line at inflicting painful fractures on the lower\nregions of my anatomy, just to be able to experience a stay in St\nStephen's Hosoital.\nEG M Were you one of the two people who were needed to make last\nTuesday'sEG M quo rate? I had a valid excuse, but four thousand\nother students at IC with no physical disabilities could have made\nit to the Great Hall. Why don't you make an effort to come to\nUnion meetings? The hustings for the sabbatical posts are to be\nheld at next Thursday'sU GM in the Great Hall. This popular\nevent combines humour with the more serious business of leaving\ncandidates telling you about their good points.\nSABBATICAL ELECTIONS In a recent survey, IC Radio discovered that few students knew\nwhat a sabbatical was. So for your delight I now present an idiot's guide to the sabbatical elections\nCertain students at IC have decided that they fancy a year off\nfrom their academic work. Not only that . . . but their lust for\npower combined with an inflated ego convinced them that the\nignorant and apathetic students at Imperial would help them achieve their aims. The candidates have spent many hours working out ways to influence the location of your '1' on the\nballot papers during the election of March lOth/l l th. Some people vote on the' I 've Heard That Name Before' principle or 'voting for A because B' san idiot' strategy or because\nthey like the look of some part of one of the candidate's anatomy. Very few spend time getting to know the candidates or\nreally understand what they have to offer.\nDo you know what makes a good President? Even if you've got\nthe answer . . . how can you find out which candidate fits your\nideals? One way is to read their manifestoes in next Friday's FELIX. The posters that are about to spring up all over College\ntell you who's standing and the handouts will give you an idea of\nwhat the candidates have done in the past and what they think\nyou'd like to see them do when they take office. IC Radio are\ntransmitting election promos and don't forget to watch STOIC as\nwell.\nThe FELIX Editor election is very difficult to vote on because\nthere are so many sides to the job that even I haven't been able\nto decide w n ich candidate to vote for.\nI'm looking for an Editor that will manage to get FELIX out on\nFridays even with all the problems that crop up over the year.\nTime is short. Some weeks Iwork for one hundred and twenty\nhours while in others I can catchup the loss of sleep by\nproducing a smaller paper. The Editor needs a large practical staff\nbut he/she must not fall into the trap of encouraging students to\nTHE LORD FLOWERS ANGERS\nMEDICAL STUDENTS\nStudents' Union have set up a committee to\noppose the recommendations. The group\ncalled FLAC (rumoured to stand for Flowers\nLiquidation Action Committee) will voice\nopposition and organise demonstrations over\n\u2022the next few months.\nThe arguments for keeping Westminster\nTeaching Hospital alive is that it has the\nhighest first time pass rate and unmatched\nhonours results. The students argued that the\ncost of training a doctor at Westminster is less\nthan at most teaching establishments in\nLondon. One argument for closing the hospital\nwas that it was small. However, the medical\nstudents commented that it was not that small\n(seventh largest out of twelve), but it was cost\neffective.\n\"The patients will suffer.\" Westminster's strong points are its radiotherapy unit, which\nconsultants have spent years to establish. Also,\nWestminster is re known for its specialist work\nwith bone marrow as well as having an\nimportant children's section. \"Westminster has\na tradition that has developed over one\nhundred and fifty years. It can't be recreated or\namalgamated.\"\nThe students blamed the authorities for\noverspending their budget on two new\nhospitals. They said it would cost twenty\nmillion pounds to transfer departments to St\nThomas' and to carry that out would be like\n\"making a first division team play with the\nfourth division's equipment . . . Tommies just\nhaven't got it.\"\nmiss lectures.\nI have found it useful to have had a year's experience working\non the paper before taking up the job as Editor. There is\nsomething unique to the weekly cycle of Friday copy deadlines\nfollowed by well-earned sleep on Friday afternoons. I soon learned\nthat one has to comprise over 'quantity'. There is never enough\ntime to do what you really want. It can be frustrating if you are a perfectionist. As the deadline comes closer, one sees a tense\nconcentration on the face of the Editor. Cigarettes are lit in increasingly rapid succession. The printer hovers in the background ready to rip the completed paste-up off the drawing\nboard. There's nothing quite like a Thursday!\nSTV Besides the posts of President and FELIX Editor there are two\nmore sabbatical positions. The Honorary Secretary and Deputy President also take a year off to work for ICU. It is your choice/your vote. If you're used to putting ' X' on ballot papers,\nforget it! We use the STV system (single transfer r able vote). If we\ntake a simple case where there are three candidates in an election. When you vote you can put the numbers, T,'2', and'3' beside the names of the candidates but you don't have to give\n2nd or 3rd\" preferences if you don't feel like it.\nThe good point with STV is that if you have two favourite\ncandidates the second choice still has your second preference if\nyour first choice fails, ie, if several candidates from the same\nstable stand for a post then they don't cancel each other's chances of winning.\nJust when you thought that you'd cracked the ICU voting\nsystem a final problem raises its head . . . destroying your confidence . . . The rules say that you need your Union card in\norder to vote. So sort through all your old papers and I expect\nthat somewhere underneath last October's edition of Mayfair will\nbe your virgin Union card, ready to have a hole punched through\nit!\nCHEERS This paragraph is dedicated to the nurses, doctors and sisters\nof St Stephen's Hospital, especially the staff of the Thomas Wakley ward and also the patients who have had to put with a maniac FELIX Editor with an obsess io ti to take photographs. I 'll\nbe out soon, but I will need a lot of help as it will take months for\nme to be able to walk without assistance.\nThankyou to everyone who has helped with FELIX over the\nlast weeks, especially Roger who has enjoyed being an acting\neditor (I think). Also cheers to all those people who visited me,\ncheering me up through a rather painful couple of weeks.\nColin Palmer\nFELIX Editor\nSt Stephen's Hospital\n5\n\n"

    "content": "THE RECTOR ATTENDS\nCOUNCIL\nOn Monday the Rector attended the\n228th meeting of Imperial College\nUnion Council held in the Concert\nHall. He briefly outlined his opinions\nof the future of the College in the face\nof the Government expenditure cuts.\nFinance\nSavings of the of one million pounds\nper year, for the next three or four\nyears were revealed to be necessary.\nThis, in his opinion, meant that no\narea of College life could escape\nexamination, but academic standards of primary importance.\nCertain departments were singled\nout as being already under scrutiny,\nin particular, Aeronautical Engineering, CCD, Botany, Zoology and\nthe Department of the History of\nScience and Technology. The\npossibilities of combining departments and changing courses is being\nclosely examined.\nHe made one point very obvious;\nnon-academic matters must be made\nto pay their way or they must go. In\nparticular the halls of residence must\nbear the total cost of their operation; \u2022\nthis means that administrative costs\nwill be shifted from College onto the\nhalls account and this, of necessity, |\nmeans a cut in the standards and\nlevel of cleaning.\nSavings\nMethods of gaining increased income\nwere also mentioned. For instance\nthe possibility of gradually removing\nthe valuable gravel on which the\nsports ground at Hariington stand is\nbeing investigated. These would be\nminimum disruption to facilities\n(using a gradual mining/replacement\nsystem) and a considerable amount\nof money could be earn t. Fees\nA matter of considerable importance\nto students is the question of\noverseas students' fees.\nFrom next October the College\nwill be charging the recommended\nminimum fees to foreign students (ie,\n\u00a32,000 pa for Maths and \u00a33,000 pa\notherwise). He stressed that this is a minimum fee, not the 'full economic'\nfee which the Government would like\nto see. This would have the effect of\npossibly reducing overseas student\nnumbers drastically in the next few\nyears. The Rector felt that this was\nnot at all desire able and added that\nthere would be absolutely no\nquestion of a hardship fund; students\nat present on courses would be\nhelped up the College's financial\ncapability, but new students would\nbe expected to pay their fees or\nleave.\nNo Guarantees\nIn answer to questions from the\nmembers of Council, the Rector\nrevealed that he could offer no\nguarantees in any field. Everything\nwould be examined and nothing can\nbe stated about priorities at present.\nHe did feel, however, that the\nproportion of women at IC should be\nincreased by attempting to maintain\nfacilities such as nursery. It was\nobvious that he feels more women\nshould enter the fields of Science and\nEngineering.\nOn the topic of four year engineering courses following the Finniston Report, the Rector stated that\nalthough no decisions were possible\nnow, he hoped that Imperial could be\none of the few colleges offering the\nfour year M Eng qualification.\nFinancial support for these courses\nwould then be made available by the\nGovernment.\nIn conclusion, he felt that it was\nimportant that we should maintain\ngood spirits and make the best of an\napparently bleak few years.\nPARACHUTING Bob Ac ramen would like to apologise to\neveryone who came along to the talk\nlast Tuesday.

The tour was fully discussed at last\nMonday night's Athletics Clubs Committee (ACC)\nmeeting and was to be discussed at an emergency\nmotion at Tuesday's Extraordinary Union General\nMeeting, but no vote could be taken on the issue\ndue to quorum being called thirteen minutes into the\nmeeting.\nICU has no policy against sporting links\nwith any country. The relevant policy states\nthat \"contacts with individuals and clubs\nfrom any part of the world allow us to\ndemonstrate the freedom we enjoy at IC\nand that such contacts help to break down\nprejudices, whilst giving individuals and IC societies the opportunity to make known\ntheir views and persuade others to their\nbeliefs\". However, the fear that other unions\nmight break sporting links with us led to\nACC strongly advising the rowing eight to\ngo under a different dame. This is difficult\nunder rowing regulations, so it was agreed\nthat if this was impossible they should go as\nindividuals, or failing this, as Imperial College Boat Club. Council discussed the issues immediately\nafter the ACC meeting had finished and\ninstructed the Union Executive to proposed\na motion to the EG M. The Executive motion\nread:\nICU Notes:\n1. The application of apartheid in South\nAfrica.\n2. The intention of Imperial College Boat\nClub to take a team to compete in a South African competition.\nICU Believes:\n1. That South Africa must be forced to\nremove the application of apartheid from its\nconstitution and that the only effective way\nto do this is to cut all links with South Africa.\n2. That in taking a team to South Africa, the\nBoat Club is in effect showing approval for\nthe South African system.\nICU Requests:\n1. That the members of Boat Club reconsider the implications of their visit and\nask themselves if one sporting fixture can be\nplayed off against the oppression of a whole\nrace.\n2. That the Boat Club realise that, should\nthey decide to continue their visit, they will\nbe doing so with the strong disapproval of\nImperial College Union.\n3. That should they decide to go, the Boat\nClub make every effort to enter the team\nunder a name other than that of Imperial\nCollege Boat Club.\nThe Executive meeting was held at\n8:30am on the same day as the EG M, at\nwhich a motion was discussed proposing\nthat the Union should stop IC Boat Club using the name on any tour to South Africa,\nbut no agreement could be reached on this\nand the motion eventually decided upon\nsimply stated our disapproval of the tour\nand requested Boat Club to make every\neffort to go under a different name.\nAt the E GMa proposal that this motion\nbe heard first was accepted by a large\nmajority. However, after the proposal speech \"by Jo Armitage on behalf of the\nExecutive, the quorum was challenged.\nOnly 297 Union members were present\n(three less than the required number), and\nso the meeting closed.\nTwo amendments had been tabled. Steve\nWebb, Captain of the Boat Club told FELIX he was prepared to accept Union disapproval, but did not believe that by\ngoing they were showing approval for the\nSouth African political system. He wanted\nto change ' ICU Believes 2' to \"the Boat Club may be seen to show support for the South\nAfrican system\". Secondly, they wanted to\ndelete' ICU Believes1'. A second amendment was also tabled to stop the Club touring, which, if passed, w hould have\nreversed current Union policy. -Steve Webb was asked by Roger Stotesbury if he was pleased to see the\nattention that this tour was getting. His reply\nwas: \" No, but on the other hand, most of\nour supporters are College sportsmen, and\nonly a few, hardliners, are vehemently\nopposed to us. I'm sure people in College\ndon't feel we are doing anything wrong.\n\"I personally don't support the Moscow' Olympics ban. In Moscow the government\nis being penal is ed for government policy; in\nconnection with South Africa, athletes are\nbeing penal is ed for government policy. The\ngovernment has virtually phased out all legal\napartheid in sports in South Africa.\"\nSo the facts are:\n* Members of IC Boat Club have been\ninvited to row in South Africa.\n* Union policy has no objection to this;\nwelcoming it, in fact.\n* ACC and ICU Executive have requested\nthat they make every effort to enter the\nteam under a name other than that of IC\nBoat Club.* ICU Executive requested the Union to\nvoice its strong disapproval.\n* By publishing this article, sporting links\nwith other unions may be affected.\nOne person involved in the wrangle at all\nlevels is Suki Kalirai, the ACC Chairman. Last week he came face to face with a moral\ndilemma; he talked to Roger Stotesbury\nAre you pleased to see the Boat Club\ngoing to South Africa?\nAs ACC Chairman, I have reservations\nabout the Boat Club going because of the\npolitical implications involved in the\nventure. It is possible that other unions\nmay try and stop sporting links with Imperial College as a result of this and\nthis will be unfair on the rest of the clubs.\nThis didn't happen with the RSM match\nwith a SA touring side?\nThat was because this wasn'taRS M team, it was a team of individuals who\njust happened to be in RS M. Bearing this\nin mind, ACC have asked Boat Club to\nmake every possible effort to go as\nindividuals and not as the IC Boat Club. And if they can't?AC C felt if every possible effort was\nmade then they should be able to gp as\nindividuals. But failing this would go as\nthe Boat Club. Continued on the back page.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS IN BRIEF\nTREES AND PARKING\nSPACES\nMore trees are to be planted in\nImperial College Road. The Rector gave his permission so as to\nfurther improve the visual beauty\nof College.\nThe trees will be at the expense\nof five or so parking spaces. For\nthe mean time these permit holders\nwill be able to use the visitor's car\npark and after this year these\nspaces will be lost.\nRoger Stotesbury adds: \" The present move must be seen in\nrelation to the past. The patch of\ngrass in front of Old Chemistry is\ngrass because the Rector once\nsaid, \"Put grass there\". At the time\nof the rebuilding of College it. was\nsuggested by some that underground\ncar parks be built. Furthermore, it is\nalso said that the College had the\noption of purchasing the car parking\nspace under the Albert Hall.\"\nThe Rector's policy of not\nsub sidi sing 'non-academic' services\nsuggest changes may be made to\npresent parking arrangements.\nBOOKSHOP PROFITS\nThe Union is to continue to make\na profit out of the Bookshop. A motion at Monday's Council calling\nfor the current profit to be claimed\non the per capita was defeated.\nMalcom Brain, who proposed the\nmotion, suggested that the prices\nof s taio nery should be reduced as\nthe Bookshop was the only 'service'\nin College to make a profit. The\nmajority of Council felt that to reduce\nthe profit, for the one year that we *\nwere on the per capita system would\nbe foolhardy move.\nWEIGHT TRAINING\nA new ten station multi gym has\nbeen bought (at great expense) and\nis now installed in the Sports Centre. The equipment is for use\nby any member of ICU at a cost of\n15p per session (free for Weights\nClub members). For the moment,\nclubs will not be allowed to book\nthe multi gy.

The\nreplies will provide some much-needed information and the comments that you have written contain\nS2 many useful ideas and much food for\n\u00a3 thought.\n* So far, we have received about 250\n.a; replies, but we really need another\n\u2022g150 or so to give us the sample that\n\u00abS we need.\nIn order to achieve this total, we\n_\ng> have sent out some more questionnaires\nSo . . . if you haven't checked the\nletter-racks lately, please do so.... If\nthere is a questionnaire lost and\nforgotten at the bottom of your\nbriefcase, please dig it out and get it\nback to us. The drinks vouchers\n(which you can pick up when you\nreturn the questionnaire) are valid\nuntil the March 4th, so please send or\nbring your questionnaire back to the\nUnion Office as soon as possible.\n* oo Malcolm Brain, ICU Deputy President, and Chris Fox, ICU\nPresident, counting the number present at last Tuesday's Extraordinary General Meeting. 297 people were present, three\nless than the number required for the meeting to continue\nfollowing the call of Quorem.

Before this idea\ngoes any further, it is essential that\nACC knows how many people are\ndefinitely interested in making use\nof this extension of the facilities;\ntherefore a petition will be posted\nin all the halls, the J CR and in the\nUnion Lower Lounge.\nMICRO PROCESSORS\nProfessor John Albery's working\nparty, set up to assess the\nCollege's position in relation to the\nindustrial applications of microprocessors, has recommended the\ncreation of a special departmental\nand administrative machinery to\nfoster and coordinate work in the\nfield of microprocessors. Further, it\nsays, a teaching unit, funded by a special UGC earmarked grant,\nshould come into being.\nAt present only Physics and Elec\nEng students receive microprocessor education.\nJUBILEE LECTURE\nLord Denning will give the fourth\nJubilee lecture, entitled Science\nUnder Scrutiny on Thursday 13th March.

If you have any suggestions\nfor new lines, different sizes, more\nconvenient opening hours, etc,\nplease send them to either: Dr\nSimon Perry (Chairman) or Roger\nS totes bury( Secretary) of the\nRefectory Suggestion Sub committee.\nBy the way, don't forget the\naccommodation photographic competition( beer voucher for\nevery entrant and a bottle of\nwhiskey as first prize). You don't have to be an expert photographer\nto enter this competition, all we're\nlooking for is interesting snaps.\nEntry forms from the Union Office.\nLONDON STUDENT GET IT WRONG Wednesday's London Student, in a moment of proN US fer v our reported that the EG M had decided to go ahead and hold a referendum on NUS. The article\nwas written by Paul Segal, LS\nNews Editor. Malcolm Brain, mentioned in the article, phoned\nPaul to find out what had happened.

    "content": "THE MICROCOMPUTER CLUB \u2022 The Microcomputer Club was founded\nbu a or nun of neo ole who felt that the\nImperial College of Science and Technology should give its members access to\nwhat all the pupils call \"New Technology\"\nwithout having to fork out the \u00a3200\nrequired to get a decent micro up and\nrunning.\nThe Club is now the proud owner of a complete system, with eight inch disks\nand a printer and a paper tape reader-punch. So we have achieved our initial\nobjective, there is a micro which any\nmember of College may use. The Club\nalso arranges talks, demonstrations and\nother events.\nOn Wednesday of this week we held an\nOpen Day, when many members of the\nclub displayed their microprocessor systems. We were amazed by the number\nof people who turned up (including the\nRector who is our Hon Pres) which\nprompted our sec to say, \"Which just\ngoes to show that there are many more\npeople interested in micro s than most\npeople think \u2014 including us!\"\nAt the show there were about ten or\ntwelve microprocessors on display, most\nof them running games programs, but one\nwas playing music \u2014 a Mk 14 and the\nClub's system was doing nothing, because\nnobody's yet written any programs for it.\nSo, if you spend 50p per day on Space\nInvaders then a comp uk it101 is for you \u2014\nthere was one micro which was running\nSpace Invaders from 1:00pm to 3:00pm almost without a break.\nOn Tuesday we had a talk on Forth by\nthe owner of the UK copy write on that\nlanguage. The demonstration was very\nimpressive in that it convinced the Club,\nwho had previously felt that it was a nice idea\nbut not worth worrying about, but now most\nof us are dying to get the language on to\nour systems. The main reason for this, I think, is the vers it ili ty of. Forth, which you\ncan redefine as you go along, so if you\nfind you don't want a square root\nfunction, but you do want an x \u2014 x+7x function you can do it!\nOn Tuesday we are having a demonstration of the Sorcerer by Miss V Downes. who received the machine for\nPC W( one of the big two micro magazines;.\nOn Tuesday 11th March David Hebditch,\nalso of PC W will be giving a talk and a demo\nof his Personal Computer Network \u2014 a system which allows communication between micro s, via the phone.\nSo if you are interested in micro s come to\nMiss Downes' talk.\nTim Panton\nPS: If you get the chance, go to the\n'Challenge Of The Chip' exhibition at the\nScience Museum \u2014 it's very good.\nMOONEY\nCampaign For Real Food\n\" Our much loved catering manager\"\nto quote The News Quiz, has after\nmuch stalling and putting off of dates,\nagreed to try to make some improvements to his food.\nThe first attempt will be between\nMonday 10th March and Friday 14th when he will attempt to produce vegetarian meals in the S her field Refectory. If this is a success (ie well\nsupported by lots of students eating\nthem), he may be persuaded to go on\nto make other changes. However, if it\nfails, due to lack of support, he will\nnot.\nThe last time that he tried this it\nfailed, \u2014 and that was in 1950. So, if\nyou want another thirty years of\nindigestible, extortionate meals, just\nignore the Sherfield Refectory during\nthe week of March.\nICCA G Today we are entertaining kids from\nBirkenhead. Meet 152 Falmouth at\n11:30am. Hurry!\nIf any op e wants to visit patients (old\nand long term) at St Pancras and St\nMary Abbots' hospitals, please come\nand see us Monday dinner times, third\nfloor, Union.

You don't have\nto be in Mines Rugby to do this,\neither and the day is as much fun for\nyou as it is for them.\nAs usual, there will be soup runs on\nTuesday and Friday, so come to\nFalmouth kitchens at 10:30pm. Taskforce will be visiting^ O APs around South Kensington. Get in\ntouch with us or Sunila Nimalasuriya,\nMaths 1.\nOr visit kids at Great Ormond Street\nHospital and play with them (but of\ncourse, you can't win).\nAll you need is time and we are always here.\nJohn Evans\nFocus on The SmirksSunday 5pm LC.

During the\nprogramme they will be exclusively announcing a competition which will take place during the Gig,\nfor which they will be giving away a copy of their\nlatest record, including free picture disc.\nDo You Like to Funk?\n(or do you just want to Get Down?)\nIt's a common misconception around College\nthat all students like Rock Music etc. (often\ncalled 'Student Music'); this, Iwould like to\nreveal, is quite untrue. I am an exe pti on to this\nstatement 'cos I prefer Disco music f Shock, Horror!) and I'm sure that there are many other\nstudents out there in Listener Land who also\nprefer disco music. So all you Funky Freakers\ncan tune in to 301m(999 kHz) every Thursday at\n6pm for an hour of \"The best of all that's good\nin music\".\nI usually play some of the week's new disco\nreleases, the records that are doing well in the\ncharts, and one or two oldies.\nAt 6.20 a guest D.J. comes in from Funky\nFulham with his Floor Fillers - the records that are\ngood for dancing to in the Discos.\nSo join me every Thursday at six.\nAlan Burton\nI.C.

We are hoping at\nleast to break even with the Rag Mag this\nyear, and possibly make a reasonable\nprofit, as there is some doubt as to whether the College will allow us to produce one next time after the fuss\nthere was \u00ab t the beginning of the year.\nThis Rag Mag in particular has caused a great deal of controversy, but the production of some sort of magazine is\nimportant to publicise Imperial College\nRag around the country as an active\ninstitution, so we need to keep it going.\nThe Deaf Children's Party will be held\nin Prince's Gardens a week on Saturday;\nwe want lots of students to come along\nto help look after the children and to\nenjoy themselves, so if you see a party\nfrom your Southside window then you know that you're invited.

Previous competitions had shown ARB S to be strong contenders,\nbut could anyone beat the experienced\ncampaigner sO' Boyle/ Brain/ Led wold/ Te ut on/ Turn combination (rumoured to\nbe entering as the Teetotal team \u2014 a. joke, surely?). The rules, a list of pubs in\nthe area, a list of treasure, and the first\nclue was handed out to the teams by the\nevent's organiser, Nab Kalsi, and the\nevent began, with teams steadily rushing\noff to their first pub as their clue was\nsolved.\nFor the next four hours, the teams\nwalked, ran, and crawled round the district, drinking as much as possible\n(with the exception of the now almost-teetotal team) and desperately searching\nfor valuable items of treasure; two pounds\nof cooked spaghetti, a car tyre, an inflatable rubber person, and a pair of\nfalse teeth (to name but a few). Before\nlong, some teams realised that there'd been a cock up somewhere; they shouldn't be receiving the same clue twice, sending them back to a previous\npub! Still, it just went to prove the old saying that Guilds couldn't organise a piss-up in a brewery, never mind a pub crawl!*\nFrom10:30 pm onwards, the teams assembled in the Lower Lounge, which\nhad not witnessed such carnage since the\nprevious year. People fought for treasure,\ntrampling on top of their less fortunate\ncomrades who had collapsed on the floor\nin a pile of ch under. Even one of the\nmarshals had become sufficiently inebriated to be able to trip over and cut\nhis eye without appearing to notice it.\nAmidst the chaos, Nab Kal si was desperately attempting to score each team's treasure and collect the marshal's \u2022 score sheets. Eventually most of the drunken slobs managed to stagger away\nhome, or alternatively crashed out where\nthey collapsed.\nThe result, announced the following\nday, was: First, ARB S( with213.2 points/head); Second, Barry's Boot Boys( with 204.7 points/head); Third, Harry's Hermits (with 194.8 points/head).\nRob McAnimall\n* Only joking, honest!\n7\n\n"
