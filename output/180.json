Mother and son doing well.\nI.C. UNION MEETING \u2014 NOVEMBER6 th Shape of things\nto come\nby C. Liddle and B. Oldfleld.\nFrom the chaos of IC Union Meetings over the past two years,\none single fact emerges; namely that IC is apathetic. This may\nseem self-evident and many people have talked about it but little\nhas been done. To create a lively and responsible Union, we must\nfirst understand the root cause of the affliction.\nWe believe that the student is not naturally apathetic but that\nhe degenerates into an uninteresting and uninspired brown-b agger after his arrival here. He is submerged among 3,000 other students,\nthe second and third years do not deign to offer any help or advice,\nwhilst the post grads do not deign to leave their research benches\nto add their more mature outlook and experience to the Union. If\nthe fresher attempts to approach an official of the Union, he is more\nthan likely to receive the ' cold shoulder,' and all the time lab reports\nand problem sheets seem to pile up in never diminishing mountains.\nAn inflationary spiral of apathy Qt t Mam \u00ab>tinc\nsets in, and this problem is met\nby each generation of freshmen.\nThey may show sufficient interest,\nto come to the first IC Union\nmeeting of the year, only to find\na complete lack of interest on the\npart of the older students, as\nshown by the poor attendance\nand general lack of intelligent\ndebate. The freshmen stay away\nfrom the next Union meeting and\nthe process of dissociation from\nUnion affairs begins. Is it really\nhis fault ?\nLast year, the first Union meeting of the session was the only\ntruly quo rate one (the final one,\nthe AGM was quo rate for about\nfive minutes). This year we hope\nthat the first Union meeting, on\nNovember 6th, will be quo rate in order that there may be a discussion of the second ratification\nof a motion proposing the reduction of the quorum to 300. (At\npresent set at 400.) Here we\nhave a fine admission of defeat\n\u2014that less than 10 per cent, of\nus are worthy of the name ' student ' in all its implications. We are led to believe that this is the\nleading scientific and technological institution in the country,\nbut the job of such a College\nshould be to produce people of\ncharacter and sensibility rather\nthan animated slide rules. A live\nUnion is essential to a complete\nr education: the reduction of the\nquorum suggests not only a dead\nUnion, but. that the corpse has\nbeen mould e ring for some time.\nWe are not asking for a repeat\nof the hysterical Union meeting\nin May, 1960, when the quorum\nwas raised from 200 to 400 and\n600 students were present. (It is\nworth noting that af this meeting,\nthe President was reinstated after\nclosed with ' Auld Lang Syne'\nand a vote of thanks all round.)\nWhat we would like to see is\nremedial support which stems\nfrom a lively and intelligent\ninterest.\nThe second equally controversial but less depressing item\non the agenda for the next Union\nMeeting is the second approval\nof the motion which will create\nthe post of Deputy President of\nIC, who is to be elected in the\nsame manner as the Hon. Secretary. This was pushed through\nat the last Union Meeting with\nlittle or no explanation as to the\nneed for such an office. We feel\nthat this position is an unnecessary addition to the numerically\nquite adequate Council, and\nwould simply serve to enlarge\ncommittees and duplicate paper\nwork. The IC Executive is able\nto fulfil its duties without the\nParkinsonian addition of another\nmouthpiece.\nTurning from the blight of\napathy to the blight of hunger\n(not Mooney), we come to the\nthird major topic on the agenda\nof the coming Union Meeting.\nThe Union will have to decide to\nwhat charity the proceeds of the\n1963 Carnival should v go. There\nwill be a motion before the house\nthat ' the sum raised should be\ngiven to the Freedom from Hunger Campaign,' and no doubt we\nshall see the usual wrangle between those supporting local\ncharities and those in favour of\nhelping national campaigns. The\narguments in favour of the local\ncharities, such as help for the old\npeople of the district, are strong\nand should not be overlooked in NOTICE TO STUDENTS from the COLLEGE SECRETARY STUDENT ACCESS TO MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL\nENGINEERING BUILDINGS\nUntil further notice access to these buildings will be from\nExhibition Road. The East Quadrangle is OUT OF BOUNDS to students who may not, therefore, enter the buildings either\nfrom Imperial Institute Road or from the Royal School of Mines\n\n"

Since the car\nwas built before 1905, it is old\nenough to qualify for the London\nto Brighton Car run, and has\ntaken part in this event ever since\nbeing acquired by the College.\nBo has a two cylinder engine,\nwith a bore of 4\u00a3in. and stroke\nof 6in., giving a displacement of\n2\\ litres, and is rated to give\n9 h.p. at 600 rpm. The layout is\nrather unusual, the two cylinders\nbeing parallel and horizontal\nalong the axis of the car, with the\ncrankshafts and the shafts in the\ngearbox lying across the car.\nThere are four forward speeds\nand a reverse, the drive being by\nchain to t ne rear wheels, giving\nthe car a top speed of 35 mph on\nthe flat.\nOn Freshers day, Bo had the\nmisfortune to shear a key in the\ncrankshaft, holding the crank\nweb to the main shaft. This\nnecessitated the removal of the\nengine and gearbox, and a complete stripping of the engine to\nrepair the damaged parts.

    "content": "KARAKORAM\nEXPEDITION\nA Reply\nIn the first week of June, Mr. H.D.D. Watson submitted an\napplication to the Exploration Board for a proposed expedition to\nthe Karakoram in June 1963. A special meeting of the Board was\ncalled to consider this proposal and held on the 21st June, 1962.\nAfter allowing for general expenses and for the average annual\ncost of insurance of expeditions (\u00a3200\u2014see Note 1), the Hon. Treasurer concluded that the Board would have about \u00a31,650 available\nfor distribution in 1962/63, if the Reserve Fund of \u00a3600 was drawn\nupon.\nThe proposed expedition would\nbe composed of 7 members from\nthe College, an external leader\nand doctor (both with previous\nHimalayan experience) and a Pakistani liaison officer, making\na total of 10. Mr. Trevor Jones\nwas to lead the expedition\u2014and\nDr. J. Swallow to accompany it.\nIt was hinted that Mr. Chris.\nBonnington had also been ap-pro ached. The expedition was to carry\nout two independent pro-gram mes, one climbing, the other\nsurveying, in the area of the\nHushe Valley, 60 miles east of\nSkardu. In addition, it was intended to carry out limited geological and meter o logical work.\nNine members of the College\nwished to be included in the\nparty, although it was uncertain\nat that time whether all of them\nwould still be at College in June\n1963.\nThe estimated cost of the expedition was approx. \u00a34,600 of\nwhich \u00a32,800 represented air\nfares and freight charges. (Be-cause of the time factor, the expedition was to fly throughout\nfrom London to Skardu.) Personal contributions would be \u00a350\nper head for students and \u00a3150\nper head for Mr. Jones and Dr.\nSwallow.\nLAMLEY'S TECHNICAL & GENERAL BOOKS\nART MATERIALS\nDRAWING INSTRUMENTS\nSTATIONERY\nPAPERBACKS\n1. 3 & S EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7. The Exploration Board was\nasked to give its approval to the\nexpedition\u2014and to support it\nwith a grant of \u00a31,200. The expedition hoped to obtain finance\nas follows :\u2014;\nI.C. Exploration Board \u00a31,200\nMount Everest Foundation\n\u00a31,400\nPersonal Contributions \u00a3750\nOutside support (and sale\nof postcards) \u00a31,250\nTotal ... \u00a34,600\nThe proposal was considered at\nvery great length. The Board\nwas satisfied with the organisation of the expedition thus far,\nand agreeable, in principle, to the\nproposed leadership. Although\nthe ability of the party to carry\nbut some of the scientific work\neffectively was questioned and\nthe composition and experience\nof the party was discussed, the\nBoard's main concern, at that\nstage, was the financial situation.\nAnd this was clearly intimated\nto the organisers by letter on\nJune 22nd.\"... it (the Board)\nregretted that it was unable to\ndevote so large a part of its resources (to the exclusion of\na lr nost any other activity in 1963)\nto an. expedition, which would\nbenefit only a few people, and,\nrelative to the expense, produce a small scientific return.\"\nFor it was evident that if the\nrequested support was granted,\nnot only would the whole of the\npresent Reserve Fund be absorbed but also there would be\nscarcely any money available\nlater in the year to finance any\nother expeditions which might\nbe proposed. The Board considered that other members of the\nCollege should be given the\nchance to gain expedition experience. Moreover the party was\nnot wholly ' representative' of\nthe College ; for besides only 70\nper cent participation by students\n(most of whom would be leaving\nCollege) the expedition was never\npublicised outside the Mountaineering Club circles. The\nBoard therefore concluded that\nbestowing \u00a31,200 to one expedition was neither the best, nor\nfairest, way of spending that\nsum.\nUnlike other \" grant-award-ing \" bodies, the College, when it\ngives its name to an expedition, virtually sponsors it\nand therefore assumes full responsibility for it. In the\ncase of an expensive expedition\noperating in a difficult and distant country, this responsibility\nand risk can be considerable,\noften involving diplomatic difficulties, and the Board must consider not only its own available\nfunds, but also the likelihood of\nthe expedition being completely\nsolvent and trouble-free at the\ntime of its departure. In the\ncase of the Karakoram exp edi tion, it was generally considered\nthat if the expedition was to be\nsupported by the Board at all,\nthen the Board ought to take a large measure of financial responsibility (\u2014and this it was\nunable to do). It was also felt\nthat in addition it would be\nnecessary to keep about \u00a3500 in\nreserve to balance any un for seen expenditure over the estimated\nlimit. This would leave the\nBoard with no money for any\nother purposes.\nWith the full support of the\nExploration Board and, the\nMount Everest Foundation, the\nexpedition still needed to gather\n\u00a31,250 from outside sources.\nHad the Board granted a lesser\namount, this would have severely\nreduced the chances of the expedition being fully supported by\nother organisations. Because of\nthe responsibility involved, the\nBoard was therefore forced not\nto support the expedition in any\nway, for with formal approval\nalone, the expedition's chances of\ngaining full financial support\nwere almost negligible.\nThe Board's decision therefore\ncalled for a change of plans on\nthe expedition's behalf or more\nconcrete evidence that sufficient\nmoney would be forthcoming\nfrom outside.\nNotes\n1. The Board automatically accepts responsibility for adequately insuring all personnel\nand equipment on any expedition that it approves and on\naverage this costs the Board\n\u00a3200 per year. Insurance of\npersonnel alone on the Karakoram expedition would have\ncost the Board approx. \u00a3100.\n2. The \" constant stream\" of\nArctic expeditions (12 out of\na total of 32\u2014many of them\ntraining expeditions) is hardly\nsurprising considering Gt.\nBritain's geographical position in the world, in that the\nArctic regions are relatively\nclose and for this reason, a target for small cheap exp e ditions. The twelve Arctic\nexpeditions have cost the\nBoard \u00a31,320 in all (on average \u00a3110 per expedition) and\nover 60 students have benefited therefrom.\nH.T. LOVE N BURY President. I.Q, Exploration\nSociety, 1961-62.\nExploration Board Rep. 1961-62.\nMines Union Meeting\nThe meeting was opened by the\nPresident with a request that\nmembers desist from the puerility\nand garbage projection which has\nattended the Union meetings of\nthe other Colleges. This was\nfollowed by a plea for tw<P minutes silence, 'for those who\ndid not return.'\nAfter elections of year reps, a ferment of discussion took place\non the subject of our mascot,\nMitch. It was reported from the\nchair that marauders from Guilds\nhad forced an entry into the\nmascot's boudoir, and removed a rotund article painted in black,\nwhite and yellow. The explanation was that Mitch, being a man, had in true Miners' t radi tion, suffered the pangs and\narrows of outrageous good fortune and had, in the nature of\nthings, been affected by Spring.\nIt was further stated that having\nsloped off one day, he had returned with a bride, Michelle.\nBeing a man of true merits, he\nhad begat a wee one, weight at\nbirth 1 lb. 3 oz., and while\nMichelle was recovering from\nher confinement in the West\nIndies, her hubby was present at\nthe meeting. The appearance of\nMitcheson was greeted with ac-claim^?)\nThe next subject under discussion was Mr. Billingham, one\ntime bearer of Michelle, and his\ncolleague, Mr. Voss. In an eloquent speech, Mr. Roy Gardner\nsuggested that these gentlemen\nshould be sold to a germ warfare\norganisation as guinea pigs, after\nsuitable treatment in the Round\nPond. The final ruling from the\nchair was that Mr. Billingham\nshould be condemned to be Mr.I CW A, with Mr. Voss as his pro-poser.\nMr. Mansen, from the floor,\nthought it a good idea for the\ngentlemen Of Mines to take their\nown beer with them on the occasion of the next Swimming Gala\nto alleviate the expense in cut red\nlast time. Mr. Mansen's splendid Gallic singing voice was much\nadmired by the President, and\nwith this as a lead, the meeting\nwas brought to a close with a resounding version of CATS. Service Overseas\nAbout half-way through next\nterm there will be an Imperial\nCollege Overseas Service Week.\nThe object of this 'campaign' will\nbe to rouse interest in voluntary\nservice in the developing countries\nand to provide information about\nschemes through which volunteers can go abroad.\nAnyone interested in helping\nwith this Week should come to\nCommittee Room A at 1.15 p.m. on Friday, 2nd November, or\ncontact Roy Ellis through the\nUnion rack.

Permanently\nCABINET MINISTER AT GENERAL STUDIES On Tuesday, October 16th, the\nRight Honourable Peter Thorneycroft, M.P., Minister of Defence,\nwas the speaker at one of the\nliveliest General Studies Lectures\nwhich Imperial College has heard\nfor some time. A packed Main Physics Lecture heard him answer questions on many important national and international\ntopics.\nAfter a light-hearted reference\nto his \" chequered career \"; at the\nBoard of Trade, the Exchequer,\nthe Ministry of Aviation and\nnow the Defence Ministry, Mr. Thorneycroft paid a graceful\ntribute to the enormous advances\nwhich modern science has made\npossible. Then, after a speech of\nonly ten minutes he made the unprecedented gesture of offering to\ndevote the remainder of his time\nto answering questions from the\nfloor.\nIn reply to a question about\nthe British deterrent, he said that,\nwhile admittedly Britain alone\ncould not hope to win a war with\nRussia, Russia knows that we\ncould nonetheless inflict en or by D. Baume\nmou s devastation on her. The\ntotal Western deterrent, however,\nof which we at the same time\nform a closely integrated part,\ncould without question defeat\nRussia utterly, although only at\ngreat cost.\nHe was confident that a shooting war would never take place ;\nand he saw every possibility that\nthe West would win convincingly\nthe less spectacular but infinitely\npreferable economic and ideological struggle for supremacy.\nIt was a tragic necessity that, in\nview of Russia's avowed intention of destroying the capitalist\nsystem, we are obliged to spend\nvast fortunes to defend ourselves\nwhile much of the world lives in\npoverty and hunger.\nOur entry into Europe, he felt,\nwas inevitable, and we must go\nin right up to the hilt. There was\nnot a\" hope in hell \" that either\nE.F.T.A. or the Commonwealth\ncould form a comparable free-trade area, \" except in the nightmare of Lord Beaverbrook.\"\nCont on page 6\nPOLL IT vs ATKINSON To-morrow, Thursday, 1 p.m. in the Concert Hall, sees the\nstart of a new series of debates\nthroughout the year. The motion\nbefore the house, ' The West is\nfighting a losing battle' should\nbe of particular interest, in view\nof the recent events on the international scene ; but of considerable interest, too, will be the\nmeeting of two distinct personalities^\u2014on the one side, proposing the motion, Brian Pollitt, the\nfirst Communist President of the\nCambridge Union, and across the\ntable, politically slightly right,\nDon Atkinson, President of UL U. Many will remember Pollitt for\nhis extraordinary treatment just\nprior to his examinations (and incidentally the Union elections)\nwhen he was badly beaten up.\nAs a result of this action, which\nprobably did his cause more\ngood than harm, he dictated\nanswers to his exams from his\nbed, and subsequently gained a first in Economics, and the presidency. Atkinson seems to have\ntaken a less perilous path to his\npresent position at U LU.A member of the School of Oriental\nand African Studies, with a special interest in Japan, he is\nwhat many would consider the\nprototype student. His personality is perhaps reflected in his\nmanner of speaking, in which he\nuses quiet confidence and logic to\nsucceed where aggressive showmanship so often fails.\nSeconding Pollitt will be Mr. Turner of IC debating fame, and\nspeaking fourth, Michael\nCoombs. The debate should\nprove an excellent start to a programme which includes a' No confidence' motion on the 29th, followed by the UL U debating\ncompetitions. There will also be\na series of addresses on debating\ntechnique by Finlay McPherson,\na well known figure in College\ndebates.\n\n"

However, we\nwonder if the effort involved in\ncollecting this sum is really\nworthwhile. IC in previous\nyears has collected about as much\nas the rest of UL put together,\nbut this still seems a paltry sum\nwhen compared with the funds\nraised by provincial Universities.\nSheffield, for example, with about\nthe same numbers as IC,\nmanaged to collect \u00a312,000.

His diary is\ncrammed full of committee meet-in gs, concerned with the running\nof the Union, and with Social\nfunctions where it is his duty to\nrepresent the College. The business side of his duties demands a great deal of preparation if he is\nto put the Union's view point to\nthe best of its advantage, and\nhis social commitments, although\noften of a very pleasant nature,\ndo take up a lot of his time. On top of this, he has to put in some\nwork for his degree, and set aside\na fair amount of time to spend\nwith his beautiful new bride.\nPerhaps there is a case for giving\nthe President a year free from\nacademic studies and for providing accommodation for married\nstudents in College.

It has\nbeen necessary to include several\nnovices in the Lowry crew, which\nhas shown considerable fighting\nspirit on recent cu tings. Despite the disadvantage of\nhaving no coach, the RCS Morphy crew is progressing well,\nat times showing its true potential. The Lowry crew has recently been strengthened by a bearded stranger, and may be\nable to surprise the critics on the\nday.\nThe Guilds crews are concentrating on fitness rather than\ntechnique, as usual, and are being\nably coached by Jan Smaalders\nand Keith Cugan, both experienced IC coaches. Their Lowry\nh \u00bbs considerable potential, but\nhas as yet been unable to produce\nperformances to show this.\nAs usual, all crews are taking\nthe race very seriously, and as\nyet, no member has been spotted\nin the bar more than eight evenings in one week, the reserve\ncapacity being reserved for the\nBoat Club Dinner on Morphy\nnight.\nTHE MOLE\nPerhaps ifs the beauty, perhaps it's the danger, ptr haj it's... well, what reason makes an apparently sane person don an old and\nstinking boiler suit and tattered pieces of leather apologies for boots,\nto crawl down small holes in the ground, only to emerge a short\ndistance away, after considerable time and effort, looking for all the world like a mud pie. Hard to believe, you say ? Yes, but it does\nhappen.\nThese intangible beings are called 'pot-hole rs,' and are distinguished in their natural location by their smell and single 1,000 candle\npower eye. Found in society, they can be distinguished by the mad,\nlost, longing look in their eyes, the shattered nails, and the ever\npresent earthy smell.\nTo try and discover what drives\nthis mole, let's venture On a short\nexcursion. We leave on a gloriously sunny day, 90 degrees in\nthe shade, dwarfed by huge rut-sacks full of so-called necessary\ngear, and set off up a mountain\nat a great pace. The lead mole\nturns round with a look of sadistic gloating and calls out' Hurry,'\nas we stumble upwards.\nSomeday, someone will finally\npropound the sad formula-weight\nof carried load increases as the\ndistance squared. Eventually we\narrive and drop exhausted to the\nfloor, only to hear the Mole tell\nus to hurry and get changed.\nPerhaps it is the suppressed ex-cite ment, or else the curiosity,\nbut we do as he says, and don\nthe cold, wet and clammy boiler\nsuits. ' Where is the cave?' somebody asks. ' There,' the Mole re-plies, pointing to an oversized\nrabbit hole. With a nit in our\nstomachs, we listen to last minute\ninstructions. ' Oh,' says the Mole\nas an afterthought, ' if anybody\nstarts to scream from cl austro phobia, he will have to be kicked\nunconscious to avoid upsetting\nthe rest of the party. You come\nsecond,' he finishes, pointing to\nour 40-40-40 camera man.\nThe Mole then lies down on\nhis stomach, and disappears\nwith a wriggle. A few seu on ds later his muffled voice yells\n'Come on,' and 40-40-40 kneels\ndown gingerly and sticks his head\nin, then struggles in. Now if you\nhave not seen a404040 wriggle\nalong a passage only 9 inches\nwide, then it'spot holing you\nshould go. We struggle, wriggle,\ncurse, down this incredibly tight\npassage. ' What is that smell ?'\nasks 40-40-40 ; ' sorry,' replies the\nMole. A little further on, the\nMole says, ' It gets a bit damp\nhere,' and we hear a loud splash\nfrom 40-40-40. 'Never mind,'\nsays the Mole, ' you have to dive\nlater on.'\nEventually after much per sua sion, we pop into a roomy\ncavern. ' Look,' says the Mole,\nand we lift our tired heads. The\nsight that meets our eyes is\nenough to dispel any doubts we\nmay have had about the whole ven-ture. We are in a cavern whose\nwalls are lined with water droplets\nwhich reflect and refract the light\ngiven out by our lamps in such\na way that the surface appears to\nbe covered with diamonds.\nPearly white stalactites, 30 feet\nlong, line one wall, a cascade 40\nft. high dominates the other wall,\n40 feet of tumbling orange and\nwhite calcite. The roof is lined\nwith a silvery film of water. This\nis our reward.\nWith great reluctance we\nfinally turn to go, but such is the\nsplendour of what we have just\nleft, that the narrow passage now\nseems much shorter and easier.\nWhen we emerge from the ground\nit is dark, and we wash ourselves\nin the still warm water of the\nstream.\nIt is with no small doubts of\nour sanity that we finally wend\nour way down to that cool refreshing pint, but such is our re-ward, our feeling of achievement,\nthat we wish time would stand\nstill and that we would never\nhave to face the harsh realities\nof fh\n<* morrow.\nm. \u201e _ . . , Published by FELIX BOARD, Imperial College, London, S.W.7 Plates & offset printing by WEST LONDON OFFSET CO.,86, Lillie Road, London, S.W.6.

A good turnout for the fresher s run, despite transport difficulties,\nshowed that at least keenness\nwas present. It remains to be\nproved whether the ability necessary to back it up will be re-ve a led. The first U.L. trial afforded us\nour first test, and only Ted\nWilkins, 3rd, Pete Ray, 5th, and\nChris James, 11th, showed good\nform although Pete Crews performed creditably in gaining 17th position.\nThe following Saturday, our\nfirst team gained 6th place in the\nU.C. Invitation Relay, losing to\nthree University teams, U.C. and\nBorough Road T.C. Ted Wilkins\nwas again in tremendous form,\nreturning the second fastest time\nof the day and beating the College best performance for the 1.8\nmile course at 8 mins. 13 sees.\nDave Colvin was seventh fast eth at 8 mins. 28 sees.\nOn Wednesday, 17th Oct., a weakened team lost to King's College at Mitcham over 6.1\nmiles, but gained some compensation by winning the second\nteam match.

Hamilton\nThe purpose of this, the first of a series of articles, is to outline\nthe events giving rise to the facilities now available for second year\nstudents to work and gain technical experience during overseas vacations ; also to describe briefly these facilities offered by the International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical\nExperience. In forthcoming issues, Felix intends covering reports\non overseas work and travel by a cross section of men and women\nfrom Imperial College.\nIn 1934 Mr. J. Newby of the Registrar's Staff was approached\nby the Engineering Society with a view to obtaining work for students\nin industry within the United Kingdom during the summer vacations.\nTit 2 demand for home postings was met and the Imperial College\nplans became more ambitious. In 1936 three students from Brussels\nwere received in this country and in 1937 a small number of Imperial\nCollege students went to Belgium for experience.\nThis exchange scheme was be- taking up the post is paid a sub-ginning to spread but War curtailed these early moves. In 1945\nthe Imperial College Vacation\nTraining Committee recommenced sending students abroad\nand arrangements were made for\nstudents to visit this country from\nseven countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Norway,\nSweden, Switzerland).\nIn 1948 a conference of organisers of student exchanges in ten\ncountries was convened at Imperial College and from this conference emerged the International\nAssociation for the Exchange of\nStudents for Technical Experience.\nIn that year 198 students were\nsent abroad under I. A. E.S.T.E,,168 of whom were from Imperial\nCollege, the remainder from\nthe other affiliated colleges and\nuniversities has since increased\nbut Imperial College still accounts for the largest individual\nnumber.\nThat 168 to 170 eligible men\nand women from Imperial are\nfound satisfactory places for an\naverage of eight weeks during\nsummer vacations does not imply\nthat all applicants are accepted.\nAs a general rule the student\nneeds to have completed the penultimate year of his undergraduate course and is required\nto have had U.K. industrial experience during the first year,\nthough this rule is not inflexible.\nThe student, on accepting a job, is required to pay a fee of\n30/- as a registration fee, each\nUniversity and College pays an\naffiliation fee according to the\nnumber of students sent abroad.\nIn most cases the cost of travel\nis met by the student who, upon\ns is ten ce allowance by the em-ploy er.A few travel grants are\nto be had, notably those made\navailable by I.C.I, and the Canadian National Research Council\nfor selected students, both of\nwhom pay travelling expenses\nplus a maintenance grant.\nI.C.I, require that an applicant\nshall work satisfactorily at one\nor other of the Company's British plants for a specified\nperiod during first year vacations\nbefore acceptance for Germany or\nSwitzerland in the second year.\nThe National Research Council of Canada has in the past\nmade up to six places available\neach year for students studying\nat British universities and col-leg es. The normal subsistence allowance varies considerably from\ncountry to country and this work\nshould not be regarded as fully\npaid employment. A number of\nstudents cover their costs en-ti rely, but those who do not may\nfind themselves a little out of\npocket, though to offset this apparent financial loss they have\ngained a broadening of experience both technical and social\nbeyond the reach of men and\nwomen remaining at home.\nIndeed, I. A. E.S.T.E. emphasizes that one of the main aims\nof the Association is to give\nstudents from member nations\nan opportunity to view another's country from the inside as it were,\nthough Felix hesitates to suggest\nthat for women students this\nshould necessarily be a Birds'\nEye View . . .\nAt present the Association is\nrepresented by 21 Full Members\nand 8 Associate Members fr nm7 both North and South America,\nEurope, the Near and Middle\nEast, Asia and Africa, representation coming from countries as far\napart as Poland, the United\nStates, India and Argentina.\nUnfortunately, some countries\nare less able than others to make\nuse of the available facilities;\nSouth Africa for instance settling\ndown to winter studies when\nthose from the Northern Hemisphere are seeking summer em-ploy ment. It may be fairly widely known\nthat some colleges such as the\nR.S. M. have for many years undertaken overseas vacation al training and these articles will\nnot cover their activities. We are\nsolely concentrating on those\nmen and women who have\navailed themselves of I. A. E.S.T.E., and with the co-operation\nof these students will publish\nfacts about the countries they\nvisited, their work, those they\nworked with and their own experiences\u2014good or otherwise.\nI. A. E.S.T.E. is now a separate\norganisation, independent of the\nImperial College, and having its\nown Memoradndum and Articles\nof Association.\nWe wish to thank Mr. A.G.E. Meacock, Superintendent of Va cation Studies. Without his kind\nassistance these and later columns\nwould not appear.\nDANCING COMPETITION IC Dancing Club is planning\nto participate in an inter-Col-legia te Dancing Competition\nwhich is the first of its kind.\nAnybody wishing to take part\nplease look at Club notice\nboard in Union Entrance Hall.\nPOLL IT vs ATKINSON( Cambridge) (London)\nNovember 1st "
