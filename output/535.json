    "content": "LETTERS\nDear Editor\nIn your report, FELIX 16th November 1979, of our recent\nstaff/student committee meeting\nyou quoted me as saying that I had \"ordered a complete freeze\non all expenditure, in the hope of\nbringing the true nature of the\nsituation home to the College\nauthorities\". What I actually said\nwas \"....home to the CCD staff, its\nstudents and the College authorities\".\nIn parallel with our call for\nadministrative action to change\nour classic if cation and grants to\nreflect the true nature of our\nundergraduate course, the\ndepartment must launch a serious\neffort to plan expenditure and\neliminate waste. Apart from the\nfact that there is, at present, no\nmoney to spend in the kitty,\nachievement of the necessary\ndegree of economy requires the\nactive awareness and collaboration of the entire CCD staff. It was\nhoped that a freeze would help to\nachieve this - indeed it has: Since\nthe freeze would inevitably affect\nstudents it needed to be brought\nto their attention, hence my\nstatement to the staff/student\ncommittee.\nYours sincerely\nMM Lehman\nHead of Department and Professor of Computing Science |\nDear Disgusted\nWe have discussed your problem at great length and have\ndecided that you may need to\nseek counselling advice.\nYour problem is not uncommon\nat IC. It begins with your\narithmetic inaccuracy. Only 85%\nof the College are unable to\nbecome pregnant and a lesser\npercentage than that are\nincapable of taking any part in the\nprocess whatsoever( these\nfigures are not at hand).\nYour second problem is\nextreme self-centred ness leading\nto paranoid exclusion of all\nproblems except those directly\naffecting yourself. In time, you\ncould expect to be able to accept\nthat other people can concern\nthemselves with issues of\nimportance to various minority\nsections without excluding the\nproblems of the majority. (In fact,\nmajorities are made up of\nminorities - often including\nindividuals!).\nYour final problem is a desire to\nbe unpleasant to individuals or\ngroups of individuals that you do\nnot personally know, nor have any\nreason to bear a grudge against.\nMost often this feeling results\nfrom an inability to understand or\ncome to terms with concepts that\nthreaten your own dogmatic\nideas. This leads to your exclusion and hatred of people\npresenting these differing views.\nYou would be better to deal with\nthese problems by open discussion with other people.\nYou may need-further advice in\norder to be able to play a constructive role in society in the\nfuture. We can suggest various\naddresses (if you could send a plain brown paper envelope to the\nFELIX Office), or you could attend\na counselling session in Huxley\nBuilding Room 640 today (Friday)\nat 2:30pm. Yours help fu fly, Anna and Marge (Ms' Raeburn\nand Proops).\nDear ICU\nAt the last Union meeting over\nthree quarters of an hour was\nspent discussing a motion against\nthe Corrie Bill. Before a vote was\ntaken on the motion the quorum\nwas successfully challenged (the\ncount was 294, six people short of\nthe required 300). The feeling at\nthe meeting, I would gu age, would\nhave passed the motion (but we\nwon't speculate on the reasons\nwhy quorum was called) and I feel\nthat most people understood the\nquestion, so to repeat the whole\ndebate would only restrict the\namount of time available to\ndiscuss other topics. In this letter I will therefore outline the case\npresented at the last U GM and\nsuggest a move to the vote at the\nnext U GM on Tuesday.\nThe motion notes the clauses in\nthe Corrie bill, believes that the\nbill will cut the number of legally\navailable abortions by 2/3rds, the\nbill constitutes a direct attack on\nabortion rights and a woman's right to choose; the bill will mean a return to backstreet abortions. It\nresolves to support future actions\nagainst the Corrie Bill, affiliation\nto the campaign against Corrie\nand organise a collection for\ndonations to Campaign against\nCorrie.\nThe bill reduces the upper time\nlimit for abortions from 28 weeks\nto 20 weeks. This will only effect\n1% of women seeking abortions.\nAt present less than 1% of\nabortions take place after 20\nweeks . These are the most\ndesperate cases - school girls\n(who hope if they don't say\nanything their periods will come\nand they won't be pregnant), older\nwomen (who mistake pregnancy\nsymptoms for the menopause),\nwomen who after having tests find\nthe child they are carrying has a high chance of physical or mental\nhandicap, if it is found that there is\na high risk of woman dying in\nchildbirth.\nAnti-abortionists always give\nthe option of adoption - but\nbesides the fact that women are\nnot breeding machines, it must be\nnoted that only white perfect\nbabies are wanted - there are over\n250,000 children in care.\nThe bill will completely smash\nthe charities who in performing\nabortions at cost (ie even though\ntheir turnover may be \u00a31 million,\nthis is used to pay staff,\nprovisions, maintenance etc.,\nthey (BPAS, PAS) are registered\ncharities). In some areas eg\nBirmingham, the NHS perform\nless than 15% of abortions in\nthose areas - the charities perform\na vital function in these areas.\nThe consciousness clause will\nnow mean that any person not\nwishing to have anything to do\nwith abortions can refuse without\neither giving any warning nor any\nreason. Obviously no one wants\nunsympathetic people involved in\nthe performing of abortions or\nafter care but unsympathetic\ndoctors who will simply refuse a woman, without referring her\nelsewhere, are certainly not\nhelping her in any way and only\ncausing more hardship and strain.\nThe British Medical Association is\nagainst the Corrie Bill.\nI therefore urge you to consider\nthese arguments, remembering\nthat a woman must be able to\ncontrol her body. Turn up to the\nUnion Meeting.\nMerche Clark\nDear People\nIn discussions on abortion, the\nmost often quoted rights are: that\nof the unborn child to life, and the\nright of the woman to determine\nwhat happens to her body. The\nsecond of these is in no way\nfundamental, as compared to the\nfirst, which is, and therefore,\ncannot be used in opposition to\nthe same. I will explain the\nreasoning behind this assertion.\nThe so-called right of the\nwoman over her body is, in this\ncase, merely an expression ofthe\nRight of Might, for the woman in\nquestion simply argues thus:\n\" Since this pregnancy is\ninconvenient to me, and since I have the capability, whether by\nlegal or illegal means to terminate\nthis pregnancy, since I have the\nmight, then I also have the right to terminate this pregnancy.\"\nThose who would argue that the woman's 'right' must prevail over\nthe right of her unborn child to\nlife, must realise that their opinion is simply another expression of\nthe right of might, since the other\npartly concerned (the unborn\nchild) is in no position to give an\nopinion, (and consequently no\nright to one!).\nIf 50% or more of abortion\noperations resulted in the death of\nthe mother, could one still speak\nof the right of \"a woman to\nabortion. In other words, if the\n'might' element were removed,\nwould the 'right' still obtain? I think not, can we consider then, a right that holds only under certain\nconditions as being truly fundamental? Again, I think not.\nI would put to you then, that the\nonly fundamental right that\nobtains in an abortion case is that\nof the unborn child to life. Do not\nmake the error of thinking that\n'might' is 'right'. It is not, and can\nnever be.\nEM Ugoala\nPhysics 3\nDear Editor\nI would like to thank all the\npeople who helped me after my\naccident on Sunday afternoon.\nEspecially those who carried me\ndown the stairs, held doors open\nand drove me to the hospital and\nthen home. Also thanks to Beit\nSecurity, St Stephens casual it y staff, Dr S Whiting and members\nof Rag.\nYours gratefully\nIan Brown\nDear Sir\nMr Philip Cole in his letter of\n16th November made a rather odd\nstatement over the calling of the\nquo rate at the last U GM, suggesting it was neither small or\nundemocratic, can he possibly\nbelieve that 294 students are\nrepresentatives of ICU as a whole? Surely they will be more\nlikely to be members of an\ninterested pressure group. This\nmechanism ensures that an\norganized group of individuals do\nnot become controlled by elites,\nor to lesser extent pluralist.\nHe also condemns the calling of\nquo rate as a political action\ndesigned to prevent a 'demo-crat ic' verdict on the motion. Yet\nby definition had the vote been\ntaken it would have been\nundemocratic, this alone must be\na justification of Mr Burton's action. It is likely that anybody\nbelieving passionately in any\ncause is going to use all weapons\nat their disposal since they will\nconsider themselves right to do\nso, that the ends justify the means,\nthis has been recognised ever\nsince Machiavelli wrote 'The\nPrince'.\nThe other major point Mr Cole .\nraised was that there should be a guillotine in operation at UG Ms, he indicates that it is preferable to\nbe efficient than to fully discuss\nan issue, did he attend the\nlectures on Totalitarianism? I doubt whether any important\nissue can be fully dealt with at aUG M, to have six important\nmotions on one agenda is absurd\nif anything of any importance is to\nresult. The executive must rethink\nits policy on the planning of the\nU GM rather than lapse into\nhysterics because people leave\nwhen they overrun.\nYours sincerely\nStephen Goulder\nLife Sciences 1\n2\n\n"

    "content": "HOCKEY: IC 1st Last Sunday, IC played their first match in\nthe Middlesex Cup series and as you must\nhave guessed from the result, it was no easy\nmatch. Spurred on by yesterday's victory\nover Mill Hill, IC went in to play this match\nwith a well renewed enthusiasm, particularly\nsince this same team annihilated us by\ndefeating us 5-1 four weeks ago.\nThe game started with Hayes going right in\nto attack and getting the first goal of the\nmatch after only eight minutes of play. This\nhowever did not stop IC because we\nimmediately counter attacked and after\nseveral good runs, won a penalty corner. As usual the trio of Martin, Ameet and lan took\nthe corner, and another Crowe special\nbrought IC level. This surprised Hayes and\nthey again started pressurizing the IC\ndefence and won several penalty corners and\na penalty stroke of which none found the net.\nJust before the end of the first half, Hayes had\nanother penalty corner and very dubiously\nscored there second goal.\nThe second half resumed with IC going\nstraight in to attack again and this time won\ntheir second penalty corner of the match\nwhich was superbly put away by lan, drawing\nIC level again. Spurred on by this, IC kept the\npressure up and won several penalty corners\nwhich were well kept out of the goal by Hayes\ndefenders. However, they gave away a long\ncorner which was this time taken by Chris\nLiles, hand-stopped by Ameet and hit right\ninto the net by Graham to put IC in the lead for\nthe first time. With IC now in the lead, their\nstyle of play changed completely with Pete,\nTony, Andy and Roger controlling the\nmidfield beautifully. With less than four\nminutes to the end of the match, Hayes won a penalty corner and this was put into the goal\nbringing them level. The full time whistle\ntherefore came with both sides having scored\nXI vs HAYES: 5 - 5\nthree goals each. It was then decided to play\nan extra time lasting fifteen minutes each\nway. So with weary players, IC again resumed\nthe battle and got a beautiful fourth goal off\nGraham from a move started by Andy and\nAmeet from the left. But just before the teams\nchanged sides, Hayes equalized also from a penalty corner.\nDuring the second half of the extra time, IC\nagain took the lead through another Crowe\nSpecial, but again, Hayes drew level from a penalty corner. Just before full time, we had\ntwo penalty corners but these were stopped\nby the goalkeeper and so when the whistle\nwent, both teams had scored five goals each.\nThe only other way left then to decide the\nmatch was by penalty strokes. IC scored all\ntheir five penalty strokes, but Hayes only\nscored three of their five thereby losing the\nmatch.\nThis, I must confess was the toughest\nmatch we have played this season and I will\ncongratulate all the players for holding out.\nActually everybody played well and all\ndeserve a word of praise, however, a greater\nshare of the praise should go to Ameet wh\ndespite threats of having his fingers creamed\nstill kept putting them down (Well Done\nAmeet!) and also to lan Crowe for his specials\n(Keep it up, Crowe!).\nThis victory means that we will be playing\nin the next round (no comments).\nThanks to all those wh stood on the sideline\nand continuously cheered us on, particularly\nJan, whose beautiful voice kept most of us\ngoing (Thanks Jan!). .\nComment: Another superb IC performance.\nTeam: P Webb, I Crowe, A Liles, R Davey, P Huges, A Rao, T De Barr (Capt), G Forbes, J Afilaka, M Shaw and C Liles.\nJohnson\nSURF\nCLUB\nHere we are in the Mech Eng foyer sipping\ncoffee (?) with the FELIX deadline fast\napproaching. Only our red rims and blue\nsacks around our eyes give away the fact that\nwe spent the night in a lay by near\nChippenham. This was the grand finale of this\nyear's surfing. We're certainly going to miss\nthe surfing now its over for this year (it's like\nmissing banging your head against a brick\nwall).\nSo far this term we've had three trips. We\nhad really good surf and weather on the first\none which gave the new members a very good\nimpression of what surfing is about (although\na completely false one!), despite having spent\nseven hours down and seven hours back on\nthe wooden benches of one of the college's minibuses (never again!).\nThe middle trip was to investigate the\npossibility of surfing at Swansea. The surf\nitself was very good, but the lack of wet suit\nhire shops will prevent us from going there.\nNot much can be said about this last trip as\nmost people burst into tears at the mention of\nit. The surf was mediocre to lousy, the\nweather not much better, the local tribe\nhostile and mechanical failures were\nabundant. Believe it or not, everybody had a good time, especially if they were a penguin\nor a masochist.\nPhil Clifton\nMark Glascodine\n(Surfers)\nFELIX is published by the Editor, on behalf of the\nImperial College Union Publications Board.

It soon became apparent that the\nweaker loose play of the President's team was\neasily out weighted by the ability of the backs,\nparticularly the first cal s s halfback combination of Dyson (Harlequins) and\nCotter (Waterloo).\nHowever, Steve Townshend's team opened\nstrongly, unlucky to only gain a22m dropout\nin a goal line scramble. The game settled into\naro unti ne of 'ICRFC' (for want of a better\nname) winning good line out possession and\nthe majority of the loose ball but the 'Guests'\nbacks tackling hard and running the ball at\nevery opportunity. Indeed, a slip by the IC\nbacks led to Dave Lilley snapping up a loose\nball and scoring a fine try, which was the only\nscore of the first half.\nThe second half restarted with the Guests\n6-0 ahead and in a strong position. This was\nquickly capitalised on with another Lilley try\nafter a fine team move involving at least three\nprop os(?!). Despite the general supremacy\nof the backs, the guests forwards never really\ncontained the rolling mauling of the IC Pack\nand with Thomas and Pascoe taking most of\nthe line-out ball the IC team gave a good\naccount of themselves.\nAfter another excellent team move led to\nan impossible dilemma, Lilley, despite his\nbetter judgement, went over to score a third\ntry, thus rendering him eligible to buy a jug.\nIC then went through a strong patch which\nled to a fine team try, scored by ???? ??????.\nAs the match drew to a close a lot of nig gly injuries began to occur, and it was just after\nthe statutory Dobknee injury that Larry\nBottomley beat an Eddy Budgen tackle to\nscore the fourth and final try. Once again\nMaurice Cotter produced a magnificent kick\nwhich rounded off a fine and entertaining\nperformance by him.\nThe match was played in a good yet\ncompetitive spirit which led to an entertaining\nand high standard of rugby. The various team\nmembers then adjourned for light refresh e ment, 'Rugby Special' and the IC bar\nnight. A special mention must go to John\nWipp (guest) who stayed to the last.\nThanks to all those who played and those\nwho watched and 'Yah! Boo! Sucks!' to those\nwho didn't. Bill Parry Smith\nIC AMNESTY GROUP\nIt has occured to us that there may be a number of people in College who would like\nto send some seasonal greetings to a prisoner\nof conscience somewhere in the world. As Cosmos Desmond mentioned last Thursday,\none of the main causes of demoralization for\na prisoner is that he feels that he has been\nforgotten. Most political prisoners aren't major national or international figures; rather\nthey are unknown people who have become\ninvolved in some way with an opposition\ngroup or have somehow come to the notice of\nthe local security forces. After arrest, they\nhave no pressure group actively working for\ntheir release and often remain in prison\nin definately, through default as it were.\nIt is for this type of prisoner that Amnesty is\nparticularly anxious. By not allowing them to\nbe forgotten, their well being is more assured\nand their release more likely. Adopted\nprisoners who have subsequently been\nreleased have all spoken of how important it\nwas to them when they learned that people\nfrom other countries were con sci us of their\nsituation. So, if you would like to send a card\nto someone, please g<3 along to the Union\nOffice, where we have left a list of addresses\nand some cards. Please bear in mind that they\nmay not be Christians or cel b rate Christmas.\nAlso, no political sentiments please, just\nsupport and best wishes.\nThanks.\n18\n\n"

    "content": "LIFE IN THE BALANCE\nNICE BIT\nOnce Rag Week is over the term is officially\non the wane and, with only the Monster C&G Carnival to go, that is nearly the case.\nAt the time of writing, the first week of the\n'Rag 11 Days' has been a wild success, both in\nterms of attendance and (more importantly)\nprofit for the Rag charities. I must\ncongratulate all those who have taken part, in\nan organisational capacity. Especially those\nfrom Mines who made the Chaps Ragarama,\ngreat fun and also Rick Archer and his\ncommittee who produced the Smoking\nConcert to be proud of.\nNASTY BIT\nWhich brings me onto a bit of a niggle. I have\nwatched with interest as the letters have piled\nin urging the Union to deal with the internal\nissues and leave the external issues to\npersonal commitment. I agree with that\nabsolutely and it was the very lynch-pin of\nwhy I stood. The letters then go on to cite\nrefectories and accommodation as such\ninternal issues, which is true, and the\neducation cuts as an external issue and it is\nhere that I must disagree. The effect of the\nreduction of the College budget is going to\nhave drastic repercussions on the overall\nservice offered by College. The college, in the\nnext few years, will be looking for massive\nsavings in its expenditure and the first things\nto suffer will be the non-academic areas, ie\nthe a fore mentioned internal issues. This is\nnot to say that the academic standard and\nnumber of courses offered won't suffer\nbecause they will. So this is where the\ncompartment alisa tion breaks down the\ninternally important issues which will be\ndirectly u affected by the external dictates of\nthe present government.\nAs to what the Union is doing in the face of\nthese problems? Well the residence and\nrefectory accounts are both very vulnerable\nbeasts and I have been in lengthy discussions\nwith all those concerned in the hope that the\npresent inflationary situation (as well as the\ncuts) does not lead to hardship to consumers,\nand too great a reduction in standards.\nCLARIFICATION BIT\nI would like to point out one or two things.\nThe profits from the bars, including the Union\nBar do not go to the Union, the bars are run\nand priced by College. Although the Bar\nCommittee has a student chairman\n(Malcolm), the prices are ultimately set by the\nRector and the Committee serves only to\nrecommend. On the subject of residence I would like to underline that an adequate\nnumber of places near college at a reasonable price is a priority. The Lexham\nGardens Head Tenancy Scheme has proved\nsuccessful, and I emphasise, owes its\nexistence to the Student Union's pressure on\nAdministration. Michael Arthur, the Union\nWelfare Adviser, has just had his brief\nchanged taking on increased accommodation responsibilities and an increased\nsphere of influence in College block, to\ncounter this an extra person in the Welfare\nCentre will be employed part-time to cover\nfor Michael, when he is out of the Welfare\nCentre.\nON THE SUBJECT OF REFECTORIES\nInstead of just producing nihilistic\ncomplaints there is a mechanism for\nconstructive criticism. The Refectory\nCommittee has a Complaints and\nSuggestions Sub Committee which has a specific brief to handle ideas from\nconsumers, ie YOU! So use the complaints\nboxes.\nEND BIT\nEnvironmental Week is coming. There a number of excellent discussions coming up,\ndon't miss the.n. You've been here long enough now to have\nformed constructive ideas on the way the\nUnion can best serve the interests of its\nmembers. Why don't you stop me, tell me, and\nat the same time test my humanoid quo tian t. Bye....Chris.\nJUST A SEC\nAfter Rag Week there is a slight rest period\nand then comes ENVIRONMENTAL WEEK. I do hope this will catch you imagination and\nexcite-you sufficiently for you to turn up to a number of events. The programme is listed in\nthe centre pages, so I need n't repeat that\nhere, despite urging you all to turn up to the\nopening event and the concert on Friday 30th November with Brothers K, one of the best\nbands I 've seen for ages (tickets 75p from\nUnion Office). I would especially like to thank\nall those who have given up time to help:\nDavid, Veronique, Kim, Paul and College Day\nBookings.\nELECTIONS\nIf you are in Elec Eng, you finally have a departmental representative. He is a first\nyear, Richard Lucas.\nPapers are up, until 5:30pm Monday, for\nanother ordinary representative' on the\nUniversity of London Student Representative\nCouncil. If you are interested, get a proposer\nand five second ers and sign your name up on\nthe papers.\nFIRST YEARS\nIf you are a first year and are interested in\norganising an International Conference on\nScience and Technology in 1981 come and\nsee me.

I attended the\nconference last year, which was held in Paris.\nIt is a most informative meeting and increases\nlinks between students from all over Europe.\nBIKES\nI am assured by College that there are plenty\nof bike racks dotted over College that are\nbarely used. A map will be going in FELIX\nshortly.\nBIKE INSURANCE AND\nVACATIONS\nI have had enquiries about whether bikes are\ninsured by the Union, if on College premises.\nThere are, but ONLY if you live in a College\nHall of Residence, Head Tenancy or Student\nHouse. All other bikes are NOT insured. I hope this has cleared up the doubts.\nI have also had enquiries about whether stuff\nleft in your college room over the vacation is\ninsured. The answer is this: If you go on\nvacation and leave various articles in your\nroom or in a locked baggage room this is\ncovered. However, the policy is subject to a condition that you take all reasonable care.\nAn interpretation of this is that If you leave\nyour room unlocked and/or occupied by\nstrangers, then those valuables would not be\ncovered.\nThe moral is this: If you wish to leave articles\nin your room over the vacation, ascertain\nwhether your room will be occupied during\nthe vacation. The Housekeeper should\npromise not to give anyone your key, in which\ncase you are covered. If they do not and you\nare told it will/may be used, then difficulties\nwould/could arise in the event of a claim.\nBADGES\nYou are still able to produce your very own\nbadges in the Union Office. The cost is 9p to\nclubs and societies and 15p to individuals.\nAlso if you want to be cool buy an\nEnvironmental Week badge.\nUGM\nSee you at the UGM this Tuesday at 1:00pm in\nthe Great Hall.\nSee you around,\nRoger.\nTICKETS ON SALE\nfor IC Choir's Christmas\nConcert in the Great Hall\non DECEMBER 7th at\n8:00pm. Tickets \u00a31.10 (75p for\nstudents) from the Union\nOffice or the Haldane\nLibrary (or contact Sue\nMcClaughry, int 3840).\nAEROSOC DARTS COMPETTION\nThe annual competition held in Beit\nQuad attracted a large number of\nentrants than in previous years. The\ntotal takings were just under \u00a310,\ntherefore a record prize of \u00a34.60 was\nawarded to the winner, Mike Napier,\nAero 2 (need I say more!), the rest going\nto Rag.\nAlso, a special mention goes to Alex\nKam, Aero Postgrad (need I say more\nagain!), whose sophisticated design\nmight have won if it had not kept\nchanging direction and buzzing the\nspectators in the Quad. Thanks also to\nthose who helped organise the event.\nLOST AND FOUND\nIf anyone lost a red address book at\nHarlington on Saturday, contact D Cornwell, Mech Eng 2.\nONE HEART LINK BRACELET HAS BEEN FOUND in the Lower Refectory.\nOwner can collect it from IC Union\nOffice.\n\n"

Joe Walsh directly contributes some\nexcellent work on slide guitar, there is also a pleasing backing of Don Felder on organ. The\nnew drummer, Tim Schmidt formerly with\nPoco, provides a rock steady beat with\ninteresting and imaginative variations in\nexact rhythm. In all this is an excellent\nproduction by Bill Szymczyk (what a name!)\nwho has very closely followed Glynn John's production style of this masterful West Coast\nband.\nThis is a good choice of single for pre-Christmas release, and if you don't already\nown the album, would make a reasonable\naddition to your record collection.\nJeremy Nunns\nRecord courtesy of IC Radio.\nBACK DUE TO POPULAR APATHY! \u2014\nIAN FORRESTER\n\n"

It is\nreaching the peak forecast for the early part\nof the winter. A new forecast by the\nGovernment due to published next week will\nshow a decline in inflation.

Students have\nwarned that hostages not set free will be tried\nby Islamic courts\nMOVE TO BAR AID TO IRA\nThe Justice Department in Washington\ndecided to move against the Irish Northern\nAid Committee accusing it of being limited to\nthe Provisional IRA. In a civil suit the US\nAttorney General alleges that the Committee\nhas failed to disclose the whole truth about its\nactivities\nNERVE GAS FEARS\nThe Russian General Staff plan to use special\nnerve gas against Nato installations, before\nresorting to nuclear weapons in the event of\nwar, according to senior defence experts in\nUS. Many of the warheads on Soviet missiles\nare known to be armed with chemical agents\nand some analysts believe that the kill rate of\nthe nerve gas is higher than that of nuclear\nwarhead over a given area\nMONDAY 19th LEYLAND WALKOUT\nA walk-out by several thousand workers\nfollows the dismissal of Derek Robinson , the\nSenior Shop Steward Convener, at British\nLeyland's Longbridge, Birmingham plant. Mr\nRobinson was dismissed for 'deliberately\nundermining the co map any' s recovery\nprogramme\" by publishing a document\ncalling for 'disruptive action'. The dismissal\noccurred at disciplinary proceedings where\nthree other senior stewards who took part in\nthe production of the document were given a warning that they too face dismissal if they do\nthe same again.\nEEC CONCERN\nAt a meeting today of EEC Finance\nMinisters it is clear that with the exception of\nLuxembourg no EEC government is ready to\nreduce the expected British net contribution,\nto the EEC of \u00a31.2 billion by more than \u00a3350\nmillion. In return for this small concession\nBritain may be expected to seel its North Sea\nOil at below market prices to member\ncountries. Government officials are reported\nto be concerned at the extent of the gap\ndividing Britain and other EEC governments.\nSHORTAGE OF PHYSICS\nTEACHERS\nAt a Royal Society Conference today, it was\nsaid that a major retraining programme for\nbiology teachers is urgently required to cope\nwith the serious shortage of physics teachers.\nFigures that the number of physics teachers\nentering secondary schools this year is well\nbelow half of the figures for five years ago\nOnly 256 physics teachers qualified k this\nyear compared with 823 biology teachers.\nTUESDAY 20th US EMBASSY HOSTAGES\nMr Andrew Young, the former American\nAmbassador at the UN, is to fly to Tehran to\ntalk with the authorities about the hostages.\nThe US served notice that it might seek action\nunder the UN Charter. As this announcement\nwas made, Ayatollah Khomeini said there was\nevidence proving the remaining hostages\nwere spies and predicted a scandal when they\nwent before a revolutionary court.\nBL STANDS FIRM\nBL said that under no circumstances would\nit reconsider the sacking of Derek Robinson,\nthe communist leader of the company's shop\nstewards. More than 18,000 BL workers went\non strike in protest and more stoppages are\nexpected at the night shifts.\nARMED GROUP SEIZES MECCA\nMOSQUE\nThe Great Mosque in the holy city of Mecca .\nwas seized by a group of 60-100 Shi'ite\nMuslims.

    "content": "MOTION TO NEXT TUESDAY'S UGM\nFROM THE FELIX EDITOR\nProposer: Colin Palmer\nSeconder: B Smith\nPUBLIC IMAGE OF ICU\nICU notes:\n1. The thrashing of the IC team in a University Challenge television\nprogramme, which was recorded on Wednesday 21 November 1979.\n2. That Queen's College Cambridge beat IC by 390 points to 140.\n3. That the national image of ICU has once again been tarnished.\n4. The absence of the Exec and the College mascot at one of the rare\nopportunities for ICU to win the public respect that we so richly deserve.\n5. That the DP and the Hon Sec were both supporting each other at a Haldane Library committee meeting, which they considered more\nimportant than attending an event that will influence millions of people's opinions of IC.\n6. The full coverage and assistance given by STOIC, IC Radio and FELIX\nto the IC University Challenge team.\n7. That the team was not suited to the questions asked as it was made up\nof a group of tea-slurping active heterosexual gentlemen.\n8. That Bamber Gascoigne remained cool during what must have been\nan extremely boring programme for him to com per e.9. That the audience filmed for the closing sequence of the IC\nprogramme consisted mainly of Sussex Students.\n10. That the audience filmed for the closing sequence of the Sussex\nprogramme consisted mainly of IC students.\n11. The failure of the Cambridge team's bell and the slowness of the IC\nteam to get their finger out to capital is e on the situation.\nICU believes:\n1. That a team made up of beer-swilling latent homosexual louts could\ndo no worse than last week's team.\n2. University Challenge is viewed by the public as one of the ultimate\ntests of university education in this country.\n3. That either the style of questions on University Challenge should\nchange or that the education given at'IC should cover a wider spectrum\nof knowledge.\n4. That the audience who obtained the IC London sign, from the TV\nstudio, showed greater initiative and ability than the team,\n5. That more women should be encouraged to come to IC so that\nstudents receive a broader education and will therefore have a better\nchance of scoring.\nIC instructs:\n1. ICU Exec to select a team made up of intelligent beer-swilling latent\nhomosexual louts, when/if they are ever invited to appear on University\nChallenge again.\n2. A representative of the ICU Exec to attend all student events,\nfeaturing IC, that receive media coverage\n3. ICU Exec to send the College mascot to all events when\nrepresentatives of ICU are asked to appear on television broadcasts.\n4. ICU Exec to write a letter to Bamber Gascoigne thanking him for\ninviting IC to take part and also asking him to ensure that our team will\nbe able to answer the questions next time by ensuring that more science\nquestions are included in the programme.\n5.

    "content": "HOW TO GET MORE\nMONEY!\nTHERE ARE 9 SPARE NURSERY PLACES....Contact University of London Union,\nMalet Street. Nearest tube: Russel Square. The places are for children aged between\ntwo and five. See Michsel Arthur or phone 580-9551 ext 41.\nLiving on a grant is not the easiest things\nat the best of times, and if, for example,\nthe full parental contribution is not\nforthcoming, it can be well nigh\nimpossible: Rising accommodation\ncosts and the effects of inflation all go to\nmaking survival that little bit more\ndifficult.\nWhen the grant figures are worked out\nthe bureaucratic mind is no doubt\ninfluenced by other benefits which\nstudents may be entitled to and the grant\nis calculated accordingly.\nThis article is a quick survey of some of\nthe ways in which you can increase your\nincome simply by filling in the right\nforms at the right time.\nDO YOUR PARENTS HAVE TO\nMAKE UP YOUR GRANT?\nIf so, by using a covenant and getting the tax\nthat your parents have already paid on their\ncontribution back from the taxman, you can\nend up with 1.43x what you get at the moment( nearly half as mucha again). There used to\nbe a number of complications with covenants\narising from the child tax-allowance, but\nthese have now disappeared and virtually\nanyone receiving a parental contribution can\nbenefit hugely, simply by filling in a form.\nFurther information on how to draw up a covenant can be obtained from the Welfare\nCentre.\nHAVE YOU EVER EARNED OVER\n\u00a3375 IN ONE TAX YEAR?\nIf you have, you may be able to claim:\nUnemployment Benefit during vacations and\nSickness Benefit if you are ill for more than\nthree days (even during term time) PLUS\nvarious other benefits.\nEligibility for these benefits is based on the\nnational insurance contributions which you\nhave paid on earnings during the RELEVANT TAX YEAR. The 'relevant tax year' is the\ncomplete tax year preceeding the calender\nyear in which you are claiming. Thus if you\nclaim in 1979 it is April 1977 - April 1978 and\nfor 1980 it is April 1978 - April 1979. The\namounts that you have to have earned and the\nbenefits they produce:\nApril 1977-1978\n\u00a3375-569\n\u00a3570-749\n\u00a3750 plus\nApril 1978-1979\n\u00a3437.50-664\n\u00a3665-874\n\u00a3875 plus\nWeekly Benefit\n\u00a39.25\n\u00a313.88\n\u00a318.50\nIf you have earned more than this you should\nget an earnings related supplement as well.\nIf you have earned this kind of money in any\n- tax year and your 17th birthday fell after April\n1977, you may be eligible even though you\ndidn't earn the right money in the right tax\nyear.\nOne thing to watch out for is the effects of\nthe dreaded 'thirteen week rule'. What this\nmeans is that if you make one claim and then\nmake another within thirteen weeks of the\nfirst, then the second claim is treated as being\na continuation of the first claim so that it is\nyour entitlement from the second claim. This\nmeans that you have to do your sums\ncarefully before making a claim or else you ,\nmay end up losing out.\nExample: Harry's entitlement during 1979 will\nbe based on the \u00a3520 that he earned during\nsummer 1977 because it falls into the 1977-78\ntax year. If he claims in 1980, his entitlement\nwill be based on the \u00a3880 that he earned\nduring summer 1978.\nThe first three days of a period of sickness or\nunemployment do not count for these\nbenefits so Harry will be entitled to a week's sickness benefit, two weeks unemployment\nbenefit for the Christmas 1979 vacation anf\nfour weeks benefit for the Easter 1980\nvacation. If Harry claims at Christmas, his\nclaim at Easter will be affected by the thirteen\nweek rule and he will get the same rate at\nEaster as he did at Christmas. If you look at\nthe benefit rates listed above, you will see that\nthis entitles him to \u00a39.25 per week. If Hary\ndoesn't claim at Christmas, his claim at Easter\nwill not be affected by the thirteen week rule\nand a quick look at the benefit rates shows\nthat he will be entitled to \u00a318.50, based on the\n\u00a3880 that he earned in the 1978-79 tax year.\nSo, if he claims at Christmas 1979, he will get:\n\u00a39.25 sickness benefit, \u00a318.50 (2 weeks at\n\u00a39.25) unemployment benefit (Christmas)\nand \u00a337.00 (four weeks at \u00a39.25)\nunemployment benefit (Easter) making a total \u00a364.75.\nIf Harry doesn't claim at Christmas however,\nhe will get \u00a39.25 sickness benefit and \u00a374.00\nunemployment benefit (Easter) making a total of \u00a383.25. So, if Harry plays his cards\nright he can make \u00a318.50 more by om mit ting to make one claim than he would have done if\nhe had made the claim.\nDO YOU PAY RENT?\nRent probably accounts for more than one\nthird of your weekly income and it is one of\nthe areas in which the biggest savings can be\nmade.\nThe Rent Acts provide machinery whereby\nany tenant can approach their local Rent\nOfficer or Rent Tribunal and ask them to\nregister a fair rent. (The choice of who you go\nto depends on the kind of accommodation\nthat you live in.) A fair rent is likely to be\naround half of what you are paying at present.\nMany landlords try to offer you a deal which\ntakes you outside the a mbit of the Rent Acts\nbut most of these are shams and need n't deprive you of your rights.\nDO YOU HAVE TO PAY RENT\nDURING THE VACATION?\nIf you do, you can claim a Rent Allowance and\na Rate Rebate from the housing department\nat your Town Hall. Actually, you can claim\nthese all the year round, but they are much\nmore beneficial during the vacation when the\ngrant doesn't cover accommodation. The\nsooner you start claiming these, the more\nmoney you will end up with.\nSUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT\nAnother way of paying your rent during the\nvacations is to claim Supplementary Benefit.\nThis involves signing on as unemployed in\nLondon each (or at any rate most) weeks\nduring the vacation. Once you have signed on\nas unemployed, you then go to the offices of\nthe Department of Health and Social Security\nto fill in some more forms and have an\ninterview.\nOne snag about claiming Supplementary\nBenefit is that it means that you are\nautomatically claiming Unemployment Benefit. This means that if you claim for your\nrent at Christmas and were thinking of\nclaiming Unemployment Benefit at Easter\nyou will be clobbered by the thirteen week\nrule.\nIf you would like further information on any of\nthis or want some of the abundant confusion\nclarified, please come and see me in the\nWelfare Centre (third floor, Union Building).\nMICHAEL ARTHUR Welfare Adviser.\nFELIX SOCIETY The first meeting will be held\non Monday 26 November at\n12:45 in the FELIX Office.\nMatters arising are elections to\nposts on the committee and the\n30th anniversary issue of\nFELIX.

    "content": "Dear Colin\nI would like to take this\nopportunity to reply to lan\nHodgson's valuable letter in last\nweek's FELIX. I disagree, for\nreasons which will become\napparent, with his statement that\nmy views on the CC Us( ie that\nthey are tribal and anti intellectual) are Irrelevant.\nHowever, I do most strongly agree\nwith him when he pointed out that\nthe high standard of entry\nrequirements for this entirely\nscience based college leads a lot\nof people to develop 'very narrow\nminds'. This mentality Mr Hodgson suggests gives rise to\nthe CC Us as they are at present\nconstituted.\nI would therefore suggest, in the\nlight of my views on the CC Us, that it would be valuable to\nenquire into the factors which Mr\nHodgson cites. It appears that at\nthe end of the first term a considerable number of first year\nstudents leave the college never\nto return. Now while some of\nthese have probably decided that\nPhysics, Mining etc are not for\nthem, I would suggest that some\nleave because they cannot stand\ncollege life. How do the CC Us reconcile this with their platitudes\nabout helping first years to settle\nin? I would suggest that the CC Us are a contributory factor, though\nnot the only one, in helping\npeople to make up their minds\nthat they should leave.\nTherefore while the CC Us are,\nas Mr Hodgson rightly suggests,\nan effect of pressures within the\ncollege, we can also see that they\nare because of their tribal\nstructure, which, as I have\npreviously pointed out, enforces a certain kind of conformity, (dare I say 'beer-swilling') contributors\nto that pressure. I would therefore\nsuggest that we should put our\nown house in order (ie reform the\nC CUSs as they are part of ICU) as\nwell as exerting our in flu ance to\nabate the other detrimental\npressures which Mr Hodgson\nsuggests exists within the college.\nYours sincerely\nFrank James\nSir\nI feel it is necessary to comment\non lan Hodgson's unjustified and\nill-substantiated remarks about\nSteve Hutching's letter (FELIX\n532) in the last edition of FELIX.\nBy admitting he does not know\nthe facts of the matter, he made\nhis already illogical change of\ntopic even more ludicrous. I fail to\nsee how his comments on CC Us are in any way related to the\ncopyright of Steve's photo-graphs.\nFor the benefit of Mr Hodgson, I will repeat some facts here.\nDespite assurances to the\ncontrary Steve recieved no credit\nfor his photograph of Barney\nMcCabe and Jim Sarsfield (FELIX\n529). Subsequently Colin Palmer\nintended to publish in FELIX a copy of Steve's photograph of the\nRCS Exec which appeared on the\ncover of Broadsheet (vol 12 no 3)\nand the front page of a local\nnewspaper. Steve (who had not\neven been asked) refused to let'\npublication take place.\nIt was at this point the letter was\nwritten to Colin Palmer concerning copy wright and it was\nnot intended for publication\nalthough not making this clear\nwas obviously an oversight on the .\npart of Steve. Thus taken out of,\nthe context it was written in (from\none individual to another) it may\nseem a bit pedantic.\nIt has already been pointed out\nto me that FELIX is a student\nnewspaper with limited circulation and not a national daily, but\nsurely it is the principle that\nmatters. Steve is a keen amateur\nphotographer who trys hard to\nmaintain his own very high\npersonal standards and perhaps\nmore importantly takes an\nobvious pride in his work. For this\nreason he (and any other\nphotographer) has a right to\nexpect some acknowledgment for\nhis efforts.\nAs avid readers of FELIX will\nappreciate there must have been\nsome justification in his letter as\nthe issue it was published in was\ninn undated with credits which\nappeared almost as miraculously\nas the printer and publishers'\nname did (FELIX 529) after the\nRag Mag controversy.\nYours faithfully\nNick Watmough\nLife Sci 1\nDear Sir\nI would like to use your columns to thank a number of people who\nhave done a lot of good for this\ncollege over the last week.\nFirstly, all those people who\nhelped with or contributed to the\nCambodia collection last Friday,\nwhich enabled me to put a cheque\nfor \u00a3230 in the post at the\nbeginning of this week.\nSecondly, to the 300 people\nwho gave blood on Monday and\nTuesday, and the hundreds more\nwho had to be turned away.\nHopefully the BTS may be able to\nfit in another day this term, along\nwith some more free tea and you'll\nhave your chance then. I'm sorry\nabout all this trouble with the\nblood do ning, much of which was\ncaused by the higher than average\nturnout couple with the unannounced arrival of the Rag\nCommittee's 'Real Ale' in the\nConcert Hall on Sunday afternoon.\nThank you very much\nJohn Whitehouse\nDear Sir\nI must write in reply to Ian\nHodgson's letter (FELIX no 533)\nwhich takes a verbal sideswipe at\nme that I am not going to allow to\npass unanswered.\nHe wrote (referring to my letter,\nFELIX no 532), \" OKI don't know\nthe facts....\", but surely this means\nhe did not read my letter properly\nin the first place. I stated the facts\nas clearly and concisely as\npossible but it seems by point was\nnot grasped. Therefore I will\nbriefly restate the important\ndetails whilst endeavour ing to\nanswer the points raised by Mr\nHodgson.\nI have taken, and will take, a large number of photographs\ndepicting student activity at IC. I have no objection to anyone at IC\nusing any of these photographs\nprovided that they ask me first (a matter of courtesy) and that when\nthe photograph is used I receive\nsome form of credit as a mark of\nthe work I have put in to produce\nthat picture.\nMr Hodgson wrote, \"Surely a simple and absolutely trivial\nmatter like that can be solved\nwithout threats?\" That is the only\npart of the paragraph with which I have any agreement. I will pass\nover the, \"absolutely trivial\" by\nmerely saying I don't regard a potential criminal offence, ie\nbreach of copyright, as trivial. I made every effort to resolve the\nsituation reasonably, speaking to\nColin on several occasions. When\nthis had no result I wrote the letter.\nIt was not intended to read as\nthreatening, merely as caution-ary. The effect of this caution can\nbe measured by the fact that in the\nlast two copies of FELIX (nos 532\nand 533) almost all the pictures\nhave carried a credit.\nI 'll close by considering the\nmost ludicrous part of lan\nHodgson' s letter. Having professed his ignorance of the\nfacts he then sees fit to pass\njudgement on me, condemning\nme as, \"a power mad prat\", whose\nletter, \"got right up my nose\". I am\nneither a prat nor power mad and\nhow he could infer either or both\nof these from my letter is a total\nmystery. Neither will I stoop so\nlow as to \"be excused the use of a most distasteful expression\" in\ndescribing what I think of lan\nHodgson's letter. All I can say is I hope the majority of students at IC\ncan write better letters than his. \"If\nnot, what hope for the world?\"\nYours\nSteve Hutchings\nChem 1\nDear Colin\nJust dropping you a line to\nthank all the people who rowed for\nRCS on Morphy Day. Including\nthe Morphy, Lowry and Rugby\neights and especially the Ladies'\nteam and cox es. Also many undying thanks to\nthe RCS Motor Club heroes who\nhave toiled for so long and have\nbeen rewarded at last by the sight\nof JEZEBEL running again.\nNamely Jon Hall, Nigel Reditt,\nDave Dodge, Martin Watson and\nAndy Wilson.\nCheers\nSean O 'Boyle R CSU President\nDear Ed\nSince I find it almost impossible\nto obtain a copy of FELIX, not\neven a discarded one, I have\nconcluded that your organ must\nbe both widely read and treasured. This, coupled with the\nfact that there are a great many\nIranian and Moslem students at IC\nhas prompted me to write\nregarding the situation in Iran.\nWhilst everyone is aware of the\nattacks against foreign diplomatic\nstaff, my concern is more with the\nrights of individual Iranians.\nThere has been a lack of human\nrights in Iran for many years, but\nsince the beginning of this year\nthe situation has worsened considerably.\nThe present regime have\nemasculated the press, suppressed the political and religious\nactivities of minorities and\neradicated the very rich Persian\nculture. The streets of Tehran are\nruled by the mob and intimidation\npervades every aspect of daily life.\nUnemployment is running at 20%,\ninflation at 30%, there are many\nshortages and the economy,\ndespite large oil revenues, is\nstagnating. Women have been\namongst those worst affected.\nApart from the obvious restrictions in personal and family\nrights there are now proposals\nthat married women will not be\npermitted to attend institutions of\nhigher education. The regime is\neven a threat to world peace\nbecause of its interference in\nneighbouring countries.\nAll this is being carried out in\nthe name of Islam, but this is\nnothing more than a veil to hide\nthe ugly face of fascism. Khomeini\nwallows in self-ag grand is e ment, something the Prophet never\nallowed himself. With executions,\nfloggings and imprisonments, the\norder of the day, they seem to\nhave forgotten the teachings of\nImam AM that there is a pleasure in\nforgiveness which there is not in\nrevenge.\nI urge everyone to support\nthose opposing this oppressive\nregime and in particular moslems\nwhose religion is being brought\ninto disrepute.\nYours sincerely\nPhilip Nash Metallurgy\n4\n\n"

    "content": "If you've never hitched out of London, then\nknowing where to start from can be a problem, so here are some bits of information\nI 've gathered:\nGo West Young Men (or Women)\nThe number 27 bus goes to Bristol, South\nWales and the South West. Well, not all the\nway, but you can catch the 27 from Barkers\non High Street Kensington and it will take you\nto Chiswick roundabout. This is a famous\nhitching spot: it is the junction between the\nNorth and South Circular Roads and the M4\nand is heavily used by all sorts of traffic. The\nbest place to stand is by a couple of small lay-by s on the slip road leading on to the M4 just a few yards from the roundabout. I would\nstrongly recommend this spot if you want to\ngo anywhere in the West: on the dozen or so\noccasions I 've hitched from there I 've never\nwaited more than fifteen minutes for a good\nlift. (NB Gunnersby tube is only a few\nhundred yards away from the roundabout\ntoo.)\nEverybody has heard of the celebrated\nMurphy-Sodde Law usually in the form\ndefined by one Jennings: \"The probability\nthat a piece of bread dropped onto a carpet\nwill fall with the buttered side down, is\ndirectly proportional to the cost of the carpet\"\nor else in the original, \"If something can go\nwrong, then it will.\" There are many minor\nlaws of sciences which are related to these,\nbut unfortunately less well-known. One is the\nLaw of Selective Gravity attributed to one of\nGalileo's pupils: \"An object will fall so as to do\nthe most damage.\" No doubt the reader will\nhave heard of the experiments carried out\nfrom the leaning Tower of Pisa in order to\nprove this, in 1612. This Tower is itself an\nexample of Murphy's law of course. A variant\nof the above law is \"A component will fail so\nas to do the most damage.\" There is also the\nLaw of Cussedness of Natural Objects which\nstates that \"the likelihood that a component\n(eg nut or ball-bearing) will roll away into an\ninaccessible place, is directly proportional to\nits importance in the apparatus.\" O 'Toole has\nmade an important Observation on Murphy's Law, viz, \"Murphy was an optimist.\"\nMurphy's law is a comment on our difficulty\nin understanding causality and coincidence\nin the Universe, and is therefore applicable to\nmany disciplines. For instance, applied to the\ntheory of queues, it yields Etorre's Observation, \"The other line alway moves\nfaster.\"\nThere a number of quite separate rules\ngoverning scientific research. These include\nGordon's Law, \"If a project is not worth doing\nat all, then it is not worth doing well,\" and\nHoare's Law of Large Problems, \"Inside every\nlarge problem is a small problem struggling\nto get out.\" Those who have studied Physics\nwill have encountered Fermi's Golden Rule\nbut may not know the Second Golden Rule,\nviz, \"whoever has the gold, makes the rules.\"\nThe Northern Lights\nStaples Corner, the start of the M1, appears\nto be a most unsuitable place to try and get a lift: the motorway leads straight off the\nroundabout junction with the North Circular\nand there is nowhere for cars to pull up\nexcept the hard shoulder (where it is illegal\nfor motorists to stop for you). Nevertheless it\nis a popular spot for hitch-hikers and on\nFriday evenings it's like a bus queue there.\nDon't be put off if you're tenth in the queue:\noffers of lifts come very frequently (every two\nor three minutes) and once past Watford Gap\nyou're well on your way to any city in the\nMidlands, North East and North West. The\n16A from Hyde Park Corner and the 266 from\nHammersmith go to the roundabout; the 16\nand 616 go to the Cricklewood Garage, which\nis only ten minutes walk away.\nCambridge Rejects\nIf you want to visit the town where you\nmight have gone to university, the M11 goes\nmost of the way there but is a surprisingly\nquiet road. The central line tube station at\nRedbridge is by the start of the Mil. Alternatively you can try the A10: Piccadilly\nline tu ve to Turnpike Lane then the W1 bus to\nthe Great Cambridge Roundabout, also on\nthe North Circular.\nOxford Rejects\nThe road to that other den of dons is the\nParkinson's Law is of course very well known,\nstating that \"work expands to fill the time\navailable\"; derivative of this is the ninety-ninety rule of project schedules: \"The first\n90% of the job takes 90% of the time, and the\nlast 10% of the job takes another 90%.\"\nTurning to Thermodynamics, there are four\nlaws, of which no-one can remember the\nzeroth law (which is actually a mathematical\nformulation of thermodynamic equilibrium);\nbut the first three laws have been\nparaphrased as follows.\n1. You can't win, you can only break even.\n2. You can only break even at absolute zero (-273 C).3. You can't ever reach absolute zero.\nThe second law leads to Zymurgy's First\nLaw of Evolving Systems Dynamics, \"Once\nyou open a can of worms, then the only way\nto re can them is to have a larger can.\nThe scientific method itself is neatly\nencapsulated in Mater's Law, \"If the facts do\nnot conform to the theory, then they must be\ndisposed of.\" A quite serious law, for a change is that thought up by William of\nOccam(12841349) and known as Occam's Razor this states, \" 9 0 % of any theory can\nusually be disposed of\" or \" a good theory has\na minimum of variables in it.\"\nIn the pseudo-sciences, very few of the\nlaws very sensible (it's said that if you laid all\nthe economists in the country end to end,\nthey'd never reach a conclusion) but I rather\nlike Barth's distinction: \"There are two types\nof people; those who divide people into two\ntypes and those who don't.\"I am sure that the Editor will be pleased to\nhear of\"any other laws of science, whether\nvariants of Murphy-Sodde's law or otherwise, which readers may have come across. (You\nwanna bet \u2014 Ed)\nDerrick Everett\nA40. You could try starting at Paddington or\nShepherd's Bush, but the recommended spot\nis the A4/North Circular Interchange at\nHanger Lane - central line tube right there.\nDeep South\nI hate hitching south from London: SE London especially is a maze of roads through\nsuburbia with no clear routes. Here are a few\npossibilities though:\nA2 for Dover, Canterbury etc: Shooters Hill\nseems to be the best bet, probably at the\njunction with Rochestar Way, but I 've never\ntried it myself (!) (36 bus to Lewisham, then\nthe 108 to Rochestar Way). A3 for\nPortsmouth. Catch the 14 bus to Putney and\nthen walk towards Richmond. After a mile\nthere's a damn good roundabout to hitch at. If\nyou want to get on the M3 there are several\nroundabouts along the Chertsey Road that\nare quite reasonable. Take the tube to\nRichmond and walk from there.\nEpitaph\nThat's my lot, but prompted by a letter in\nFELIX two weeks ago, I started thinking about\nthe idea of a hitch-hiking race and wondered\nabout combining it with a way of raising\nmoney for Rag. How about a day's sponsored\nhitching race around Easter time? (ie when\nthe weather is better). If you've any ideas on\nthis, drop me a line via the FELIX Office.\nGilly Anchors\nSUMMER IN AMERICA\nWouldn't you like to work in America next summer\nand earn enough to tour the States and Canada? Of\ncourse you would, so why not do it next year with\nthe British Universities North America Club?\nBUNAC is a non-profit making national club\nwhich organises an exchange program enabling\nstudents at British universities - including overseas\nstudents - to work in the USA and Canada. BUNAC\narranges members' work permits, flights, insurance\nand the first night's board in America. They also\nhave an office in New York to give help to the\nparticipants, should they need it.\nMembers have the choice of finding their own job\nor of working at a kids' summer camp. Those who\nchoose to work at a camp have the further choice of\nwhether to work with the children (it helps if you are\na bit extrovert) or working on the kitchen an\nmaintenance side. Those who choose to work on a camp have everything arranged for them. However,\nthose members choosing the other scheme have to\narrange their own job for themselves, although\nBUNAC does publish a small job directory early\nnext year to help. It is possible to get jobs in industry\nthat are even better paid than the casual labour jobs\nthat most participants work at. The idea of the\nschemes is \u00bbK~.t members should be able to break\neven overall if they wish.\nInterested? Then come and find out more about\nthe BUNAC schemes at our weekly meetings, every\nFriday between 12:30 and 1:30 in the Green\nCommittee Room on the 3rd floor of the Union\nBuilding.\nIC BUNAC Committee: Philip Harper (Physics 3)\nand James Rowley (Physics 2).\nAWFUL RECORD REVIEW\nSarah Brightman and the Aliens\n'LOVE IN A UFO'\n(release date October 12th) Similar to 'I Lost my Heart to a Starship\nTrooper', which is all that need be said,\nexcept that it contains the touching lyric: \" Oh what a trip it was - so cosmic-ly orgasmic, I'd no idea he was an android made of plastic\".\nSimon Hodgson\nSOME LITTLE KNOWN\nPHYSICAL LAWS\n14\n\n"

    "content": "RUGBY STREATHAM & CROYDON 2nds vs IC 1st XI:\n18-0\nThis match was expected to be tough and it\nlived up to our expectations. The game was a lively affair played in a hard sporting spirit.\nFor twenty minutes after the kick off, IC were\non the defence and apart from a few breaks\ninto the opponents half, most of this time was\nspent keeping the Streatham pack at bay. Our\nmost promising break came after twenty-five\nminutes. The ball was won by the forwards on\none side of the field and smartly passed along\nthe 3's to Dick Pullin, making an overlap on\nThewing, he ran forward and was only\nsopped, a couple of yards from the try line. The second half, started in a similar fashion\nand only after Streatham had managed to\nscore their points, did IC begin to make a real\nimpact using our superior fitness, is not\nstrength, we were beginning to cause them\nsome problems. There were some good team\nefforts with support always their when\nneeded. The best chance of the match came,\nwhen Will Burgoyne made a swerving run\nthrough the middle ofthe field only to cornea\ncropper three yards from the line.\nAlthough IC were unable to put any points\non the boards, the play in the last quarter of\nthe match was an encouraging sign for future\nmatches.\nEGB\nIC 1st XV vs HAPPY HOOKERS (PLUS ONE):\n8-32\nFrom the outset this was going to be one of\nIC's toughest but most interesting confrontations. The Happy Hookers, were a team of 'outstanding' athletes, who by\npersistent pressure (applied to varius\nanatomical areas), ran their opposition into\nthe ground.\nStraight from the kick-off, the Hookers (still\nhappy) collected the ball and Cathy making a blinding run up the wing and evading six\ntackles scored the first points of the day.\nFrom an early point in the match, it was\nclear that the Hookers were going to be\nlacking in pure brute strength, but they more\nthan made up for this in brains and\ngood looks, especially Edwina in her (?) deep\nburgundy skirt and matching ankle socks.\nShe (?) made the opposition look decidedly\nugly!\nAs the match progressed, the Hookers\n(becoming happier all the time) began to\ndominate all aspects of play (apart from\n'groping'. 1st prize Steve Gunn, 2nd prize\nRobin Davies). Through some inspired\npenalty moves ('I like the Cathy Snook\nSpecial') more tries came from: Cathy Z, Faye, Shirley, Silvana and a few others. The\nonly successful conversion attempt was put\nover by Silvana (who we 'pinched' from\nMilan). The match finally finished with the\nscore line reading: IC 8pts and Happy\nHookers 32pts and 2 pairs of shorts.\nThe teams abandoned the pitch for a good\n'se sh' in the bar.\nHappy Hookers: Shirley (Capt), Cathy,\nSue, Cathy (different), Edwina, Silvana, Jane,\nCaroling, Barbara, (Killer) Mary, Julia ('Sit on\nmy head'), Faye, Jenny Lesley and Lynn.\nTHANK YOU LADIES!!\nEGB\nHOCKEY\nMILL HILL vs IC 1st XI: 0-2\nI bet you have all been wondering why\nthere has been no Hockey Club 1st XI reports\nin FELIX of late. Well, I will keep you guessing\nbut here is a full report of last Saturday's match. This being the fifth match in our\nrelatively new Middlesex league division 1\nand considering all our previous results in\nthis division, IC went to the field fully\nprepared to go for the kill (or be slaughtered\nagain). The game started with the College\nfielding only 10 players because Pete Hughes\nwas not around (his excuse was that he had a puncture). However, this did not deter the\nplayers as they went straight in to attack.\nAfter about 10 minutes, Pete Hughes\narrived and did a magnificent strip on the\nsideline to change into his playing gear. This\nmust have distracted the oppositions minds\nbecause they seemed to loose their rhythm all\nof a sudden (Oh Boy! It was exciting!).\nHaving fielded a full side, it became quite\no bvi us that IC was in full control ofthe game\njudging by the super crosses made by\nGraham Forbes and the way Tony Ameet Rao\nand Martin Shaw kept moving around. Round\nabout the 20th minute, Tony (Kehar) De Barr\nstarted a splendid move and passed the ball\nthrough Ameet to yours truly who magnificently ran into the D, but was\nunfortunately crushed by the two defenders\nand therefore got IC a penalty corner. As\nusual, Mr Ian Crowe was called to the rescue.\nThe push was taken by Martin Shaw and\nbeautifully hand stopped by Ameet before\nbeing superbly belted through the keeper's feet into the net by Mr Crowe. This I must\nconfess was the goal of the match because\nthe ball plucked off the toe nail of one of the\ndefenders on its destruction course into the\nnet.\nThe rest ofthe first half saw Mill Hill putting\non some pressure but, they were kept off the\npost by Phil Webb and his five aides. The\nsecond half continued in the same fashion\nwith Tony, Pete and Andy Lilies harassing in\nIC LADIES HOCKEY\nOn Wednesday November 14th, in a cup\nmatch against Kings College we lost 2-1.\nAfter their 13-0 win over Surrey University\nthe previous Wednesday, IC ladies sat back\nand let a cup match slip away from their grasp\nin the last five minutes of the game.\nDuring the first half of the match there was\na lot of pressure on IC, even so at half time we\nwere 1-0 up from a goal by Mary Harrington.\nThere were several attempts at goal, by IC\nduring the second half but to no avail. Then\nfive minutes before the end, Kings broke free,\nwith only two defenders to beat, they scored.\nIC were just recovering from this when Kings\nscored again. To win the match 2-1.\nTeam: Averil Horton, Alex Burnip, Cathy\nCrossley, Caroline Brown, Julia Towns\n(Capt), Dana Clark, Debra Mendes, Karen\nJones, Wendy Slaughter, Mary Harrington\nand Alison Oversby (Umpire).\nmidfield while Martin Shaw kept running from\none side of the field to the other in an attempt\nto loose his shadow (he did n of succeed). The\nsecond goal of the match came from a free hit\njust outside the D which was taken by Tony.\nThe hit left two defenders flat-footed,\nthereby giving Ameet enough space to beat\nthe goalkeeper before deciding to tuck the\nball away in the net.\nAfter the second goal, Mill Hill seemed to\ndig up some hidden strength and again\nstarted putting pressure on the IC defence\nuntil they won a penalty stroke. Before the\npenalty was taken, Phil Webb took 11/2\nminutes off to say a special prayer which\ncompletely para liz ed the striker who then\npushed the ball straight to Phil's feet (magic\nPhil). After the penalty, Mill Hill still kept the\npressure up and won themselves several\npenalty corners some of which were hit out\nwhile the few that were well directed were\ndealt with accordingly by Phil.\nWe did however come back into the game \u2022\nwith yours truly streaking down the right wing\nand Chris Liles flashing down the left wing.\nMarin later decided to change places with\nChris who then resumed the job of running\nacross the field.\nWith about ten minutes to go, Chris had a good run down the right wing before heading\nfor the D( don't ask me how he managed it)\nand then got the ball over the keeper into the\nnet. This goal was however disallowed\nbecause yours truly was said to be offside\n(sorry Chris, the ref was wrong).\nThe rest of the game saw IC increasing the\npressure again with Mill Hill's keeper\nnarrowly saving two more Crowe Specials.\nOverall, it was a fine IC performance and I can promise you that this team has a very\ngood future in their new division.\nTeam: P Webb, I Crowe, A Liles, R Davey, P Hughes, A Rao, T De Barr (Capt), G Forbes, J Afilake, M Shaw and C Liles.\nJohnson\nIC Ladies vs London Hospital: 3-1\nLast Saturday IC Ladies took on London\nHospital, last year's runners up'in the league.\nTo start off with we were at a disadvantage as\nthey were wearing our colours (we having\nhad to change our shirts). A few people\nmistook their players for ours hence we were\n1-0 down shortly after the game started!\nIC pulled back not long afterwards with a good clean goal by Kathy Snook. From then\non IC were in command, spreading the ball\nwell across the field and not giving London\nHospital many openings. Kathy Snook went\non to score a hat trick making the final score\n3-1.\n, Team: Fay Hood, Clare Davy, Cathy\nCrossley, Julia Towns (Capt), Shirley\nCourse, Dana Clark, Debra Mendes, Karen\nJones, Kathy Snook, Jan Clarke, and Alison\nOversby (umpire and player).\nJulia Towns\n17\n\n"

    "content": "BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER CLUB\nThe team of the week was IC'C team, who traumatic ally and resolutely confounded their\nopposition and won50 to go top of the league. I won't reminisce on the fact but it speaks for itself; so\nwithout making a mountain out of mole hill or a twenty break out of ATE tem adi, I'll pass to the\nnext match.\nThe A team played QM C expecting to get well\nthrashed and \u00abthis nearly happened except they\nmeandered to a41 win. First on was Dave\nCrossedout who might be the window to watch but\nis catastrophically not the player to watch. His snooker is enough to bore the pants off a pregnant\nrhinoceros but he is good with the yellow (ethnic\ncomments deleted). He won (I bet you all wanted\nto hear that).\nNext Titlock came on the table and then came to\nthe table to play snooker (I think he performs the\nformer better). As the Pressy, he's supposed to set a good example but he's going through adolescence\njust at the moment, so we understand his nervous\nacne and nocturnal em missive problems even\nthough he fluke da historic victory.\nOn third was M Loud lover whose snooker\nability has been compared to Charlie Williams jokes and Les Dawson's piano playing. Barmaids\naside. Loud love was laughing raucously at his own pla\\ through out the match and at the end, his\nfestering car cus was debauched and exhumed from\nthe snooker room. (I hear he was resurrected\nafterwards). He won on the black (Fuck knows\nhow).\nThe next player for a game was Geoff 'that\n\"Caroline's got nice legs' Keymer suffering from a slight touch of Calvert's Snookeritis Uselessitis lost\nhis first game ever; forever or ever. The tear drops\nsmudged his mascara and his frothing lips spread\nblue lipstick until after an eon's torment, he at last\nrealised he couldn't for God's sake, play bloody\nsnooker and why because our num ero uno player,\nthe evil Count Franken trip( Chrissipooes) has\nshattered his bol lacks, in shooting into first place.\nHow can this recognised alcoholic do this to the\ngentle cuddly Keymer. Easy with the determination.of a bottle of Ribe na( that'saL r> ut\nhow much it needs), he also won.\nTeam: C Sidetrip, G Murky, D Crossroads, M Loudlover, S Titlock.\nThe infamous A team fought a tough, gni, ing, sadistic, masochistic, blood bath at Ch are Cross.\nThe first player was that superheavy weight, Billy\nBunter division brawler S Bendit. What a player\nHas an IC player showed such sheer lack of fibre. If\nhe thinks the balls are really bol lock shaped, I think\nhe better just examine his own for a minute or two\nor else just start supporting Bristol Rovers. Of course, he lost miserably, bu; like ht said: \" Yon can't teach an old dog how to screw if he doesn't know already\". And as for Chris Calvert, well I never (except twice a week). Chrissipnopooes,\nwithout san jitters backing him up.. ., wa~ as\nsuccessful as a eunuch in a brothel. He did come\nsecond however which gets you a silver medal into\nOlympics but Chris, old fruit, only gets you a kick\nin the groin in IC. (You're groins must be ^ ch ng by now.)\nSo 2-0 down, Gene Stevens came to the table.\nThis keen physics b of T, soon brought his opponents\nego down to his own minimal level. Being constantly eyed by several Miss World contenders,\nas the next best thing to Al Pacino, he stroked hs\nway to a ball busting exhibition of true universal\ndimensions.\nInto the limelight crawled Tomsk, doing natural\nin v'ies s ions of a fresh turd. ACter some heckling\n, :\nmi .he cannibalistic ai.dien ce, visual ising Tomsk le tween two sheets of bread (turd sandwich), he\nproceeded <vith tongue in mouth brilliance.\nChecking his two teeth were still in his mouth, he\nwhistled the firs red in to the pocket followed by\nthe v v'.ii te, his cue and his nose. Some how, giving\nnim som'- credit just for existance, he won and was\nejected i rom the table by a passionate Leclezio\n(who says, red black, red black, white is Leclezio\nmissing a break). Ayat holl ah Leclezio (greatest\nfan) won easily and afterwards released his\nhostages (his own team mates). Final score was 3-2\nto IC. Team: A Doubleglazio. T Maladjusted, S Beans\n(Capt), C Pervert and S Bent.\n\\\nEntries are required for the billiards and doubles\ntournaments. Closing date: Friday23 rd November. These competitions are run over a few\nweeks duration. Entrance 15p, non-members 30p.. Dai Bach\nWATER POLO\nIC Water Polo Club did not get of T to a good start\nin the Middlesex League this year. IC2 nds had their first match on November6 th against Enfield\n(away). In the first quarter IC took some time to\nsettle against a team with more enthusiasm than\nskill. By the end of the first quarter we were 3-0\ndown and they scored two more goals in the second\nquarter. After the second break. IC went into their\nstride. Nick Buckland and Nick Last were playing\nwell at the back and Pat Porter and Mike Casey\nwere passing the ball accurately mid-pool. IC broke through and Dimitri Papaconstantinou\nscored our first goal, a cunning shot, after a fine\npass from Adrien Butler. We kept the pressure on and Ko staR i bar scored our second goal, which was an expertly placed shot coming from the halfway line. Enfield, however, hit back with even\nmore strength and put two more goals in the net.\nKos ta scored our first goal in the fourth quarter, as\na final attempt to get IC back in the match; but the\nopposition scored two more goals to make the final\nscore 3-9.\nBut the worst was yet to come. The next day IC2 nds had their second match of the season against\nHounslow (away). The first two quarters\nHounslow seemed to have played all their own way\nand they managed to score seven goals. However,\nin the third quarter IC pulled together as a team\nand started attacking fiercely. Our veteran player\nJim Williams scored an exquisite goal, our only one\nof the night (well done jim!). After that, Hounslow came back into the attack and started breaking\nthrough yet again IC's slightly disorganized\ndefence. They scored five more goals (shame!) until\nthe final score was, dare I say, 1-12.\nSo. IC2 nds started their season with two defeats\nwhich would have been heavier if Dave Roberts\nhadn't been playing both matches away!\nTeam: D Roberts. N Buckland, N Last, P Porter,\nM Casey. D Chadwick. A Butler. KRi bar,D Papaconstantinou and J Williams.\nOn November 12th it was IC Ists turn to show\nwhat they could do. They p4a\\ ed a good strong\ngame against Tower Hamlets (away again!). The IC attack pushed forward from the throw in, and\nTABLE TENNIS\nMatches two weeks ago (no report last\nweek because , even I get sick of writing this\ndrivel!):\nIC 1 vs Exiles 5: 6-3\nIC 2 vs Inco: 3-6\nIC 3 vs ED&FMAN S& SC (what a mouthful!):\n9-0.\nNow last week. The firsts beat Hong Kong\nStudents Club 6-3, with Hong winning 1\n(ironic!), Kartick 2 and Pete 3. The seconds\nlost again to NALGO (and this time it was due\nto an off-day for their previously top player) -never mind Andy, your resignation has been\naccepted. (Only 3-6 though, again). The\nthirds had their hardest match thus far, only\nwinning 6-3. Their opponents Marks and\nSpencer, however, had improved TABLE TENNIS\ntreme dou sly from last year. (Even I won 3-3\nagainst them!)\nOf course the most 'important' match was\nthe fourths vs Thames Water Authority. I actually won all my (two) games (only two\nbecause one of their players failed to arrive)\nfor the first time this season - ah happy days!\nWell after a particularly boring report\n(especially as you've all been waiting two\nweeks for it) I think I 'll stop before I fall asleep.\nOh! But I haven't mentioned enough\nsuperstars so, special praise to Bob Edde (2\nwins for the seconds) and Hans Joseffson\n(who has never played in a team before) for\nnot losing more than 11 points out of 21 in any\ngame - cheers!\nour efforts brought quick results. Mike McCartney scored our first goal and Andy Smith our second.\nThe opposition, however, did not weaken and they\nscored a goal at the end of the first quarter and two\nmore in the second. But IC were not going to let\nthem get away with it. The defence was passing the\nball quickly up front and Cliff Spooner was\nexpertly coordinating the moves of the team. Mike McCartney equalise d with a line shot. Finally Tower Hamlets managed to win the match by\nscoring a very lucky goal.\nTeam:S Tayler, D Dunstone, P Hind le,O Spooner. MM c Cart nery, P McCartney, A Smith, KRi bar and P Mills. Dimitri V Papconstantinou\nIC Water Polo Club\nULU FALLS TO IC\n\u2022 Volleyball is one or the most popular sports in the world, more sc even than football. It is\nnot very widespread in Britain, although\nmany colleges do run teams. IC is one of\nthese and plays one match a week in the\nleague.\nAlthough previous performances have\nbeen poor, on Wednesday the team\nremembered how to play volleyball, and\neventually gave a fine display of good class\nplay, beating ULU by 3 sets to 2.\nStarting badly, only 2 points were scored in\nthe first two sets, but IC so or. came back to\nwin sets 3 and 4 convincingly and built up a148 lead in the final set, eventually scoring\nthe winning point after several ferocious\nrallies. The final score was 0-15, 2-15, 15-7,\nand 15-12.\nThe team was: Suki Kalirai (court capt),\nAndy Ciuksza, Henry Szyszko, Marek\nBanasiak, Dave Penty, Peter Dias-Lalcaca,\nLech Bogdanowicz, Tony Briers, Marc Young\n(capt) and S Tarn.\nThanks go to our few (but vocal)\nsupporters, Vic Tybulewicz and Carolyn\nWainwright.\n19\n\n"
