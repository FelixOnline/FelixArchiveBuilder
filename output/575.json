    "content": "Dear Sir\nThe Phantom Tyre Slasher of\nSouthside is not the only person\ndisgruntled about the number of\nnon-permit holding cars around\nSouthside. Despite having a Southside permit, Iam often\nunable to find a place at all, and\nhave to leave my car in 'illegal'\nplaces on the main campus, so\nannoying the legal users there\ntoo.\nA quick survey today showed\nover a dozen permit-less cars plus\ntwo abandoned vehicles that\nhave been there over six months.\nWhy have these not been removed,\nand where are the people with\nthe big stickers?\ntours\nPhilip Harper Physics PG Dear Sir\nI hope your readers procrastinate no longer. If they are not\ncareful they will miss their chance to become a founder member of Imperial College Angling Club. We hope to have our first\nmatch on the Serpentine on\nSaturday, February7 in i he morning (from small acorns, etc).\nIf you arc at all interested \u2022\ncome along to Southside Upper Lounge any time after 12:30pm on Thursdays and see what we\nhave to offer.\nYours sincerely\nDave Kclsall\nChe mEn gPG PS: Why not sign the notice in\nthe Union Lower Lounge?\nDear Sir\nWith reference to the recent\nLondon Student cover story I feel\nprompted to speak up for firms\nrecruiting graduates to work in\nSouth Africa. While not necessarily supporting apartheid I have become increasingly anti-\" Anti Apartheid\" since return-ing from ten months in the\nSouth African mining industry\nand starting at IC. Let me say\nthat I do not pretend to be well\ninformed about South Africa's internal affairs and I'm not so\nnaive that I believe there are no\ninjustices within the Republic,\ni but is it fair to discriminate against these firms, especially\nwhen some of them \u2014 certainly\nthose in mining( e.g. Union Corporation) \u2014 are probably\nleading the way in narrowing the\ngaps between blacks' and whites'\nstandards of living. My stay\nabroad gave me an insight into\nsome South African policies in\nthe field of race relations Consequently it angers me and\ndestroys my faith in human nature knowing that most students, on reading such reports\nin the media, will accept them on\nface value. I ask that the editorial\nboard of lj>nd on Student restrict\ntheir reporting to what actually\nhappened and leave out what I see as propaganda. As for LSE Anti Apartheid, I wish them\nsuccess in the good work they do,\nbut that they do not attempt to\ninterfere with students' bias. I would like to believe that the\nonly reason most IC students\nbank with Nat West is because\nthey have the most convenient\nbranch.\nI think some of my colleagues\nin RS M would agree with my\nviews. Many of them will work in\nSouth Africa after graduating,\nindeed many of them have already had the opportunity to.\nwhich I suggest is more than can\nbe said for members of the Anti Apartheid Movement.\nYours respectfully\nDV Molesworth\nMining1 Dear Mr FELIX Editor\nAfter an exhaustive feasibility\nstudy over a period of four years,\nwe have finally discovered the\nhidden meanings of the Royal College of Science chant ' Kan gela'.\nThe translation of their loud\nbut nevertheless disch or dant( sic)\nand unr hy m ical( sic?) shouts, is\nembedded in the history of the\nold language of Fanakalo.\nFanakalo is a Southern African\n(South Africa, +Zambia +Zim-bab we) lin qua franca which is a bastard iz ation of Zulu, Xhosa,\nBasotho, and English in order to\naid widespread communication\nbetween numerous tribes.\n' K angela Arma do la' in Fanakalo means ' Examine your\nknee (or elbow) pads'. Therefore\nwe now understand the hidden\nmeanings which belie the RCS Union. They of course fully realise their inferiority to the\nother CC U's, namely RS M. and\nthus the RCS executive need to\nremind their students and most\nimportantly the new fresher s, that they must constantly inspect\ntheir knee and elbow pads. This\nwould undoubtedly prevent callouses forming when bowing\ndown on their knees to the more\nsuperior CC Us. Thus, Mr Editor, we rest our\ncase on the foundation and subsequent tradition of the RCS Union. Yours sincerely\nA Fanakalo Translator\nPS: For any doubting RCS student, the translation can be\nproved by looking in an English/ Fanakalo Dictionary.\nDear Steve\nI would like to say a few words\nabout D&D. Firstly, I would like\nto thank all those who worked so\nhard to make the evening such a success. Secondly I would like to\nthank the Royal Garden Hotel\nfor providing such an excellent\nvenue, and Barkers, Waitrose.\nthe Old Centralians, Alans Bar.\nThe Union Bar, Links, Chaps\nand Elec Eng4 for providing\nraffle prizes.\nI would also like to explain\nwhy we had to finish early. The\nday before the event we were\ninformed that the police had withdrawn the late licence. Alter\nlengthy negotiations, involving\nsolicitors, by three o 'clock on\nFriday we knew that w.e could\nnot legally remain in the Building\nafter 1:00am. We were not the\nonly victims: the Royal Garden Hotel staff party was also restricted to an11:30bar extension. No one could have\nbeen more disappointed about\nthis than us. but we did not\nmention it publicly during the\ndinner, in order to give the Royal Garden a chance to give us some\nleeway. This they did, letting us\ncontinue the music until 1:30am and leave by 2:00a m.We are sorry if this in anyway\nspoilt anyone's enjoyment ol the\nevening. It was not as we would\nhave wanted, but everything that\ncould have been done was done.\n} ours\nDave Gayer\nPresident C&G Union Dear Sir\nLast Friday was Guilds D&D. In previous years this function\nhas continued until around5:00 am. With the event being\nheld outside College there was\nmuch speculation as to what time\nit would finish. The cons en us of\nopinion( including the Exec) seemed to be that the bar would\nclose at 2:00am and we would\nleave the hotel by 3:00am. As it\ntranspired the bar closed at\n1:00am and we were informed\nthat we had to be out by 1:30a m.We feel that an announcement\nshould have been made before\nthe dinner or during the speeches,\nto this effect, since Simon Shaw\nknew about this on Thursday.\nThose who expressed their discontent were harangued and\ninsulted by Guilds/ Links hacks,\nas though Guilds were beyond\nreproach. We would also like to\npoint out that the cabaret seemed\nmore appropriate to Carnival than D&D, and we don't consider two records a disco, how\nabout a refund?\nIn conclusion we would like to\nrecord that the \" Dinner\" and\nservice were excellent (Mooney\ntake note!!) but the evening was\ntarnished by lack of insight in not\nreorganising the entertainment.\nYours\nJon Ashley\nChris Biss\nVee Baker\nKeith Morris Russ Gilbert\nLinda Brehault\nNicole Charters\nDiane Williams Sue Dealler\nMandy Ireland\nSir\nI write in response to the\nphotograph and inscription written in association for FELIX, January30,1981. Not only was\nit a foolish display on the part of\nthe person who addressed himself\nas J Christ, but it was utterly-abhorrent to anyone who has\ncome to realise the sheer futility\nof life apart from knowing Jesus\nChrist as Saviour and Lord. No, there is no sentimentality attached to the fact that we are all\nsinners in God's sight, and that\nall of mankind de spar at ely needs\nsaving from the s in which readily, and consistently perverts\na man( or woman's) life.\nReligious nonsense you may\nsay, but the fact is that man is not\nas his Creator intended him, and\nis now rotten to the core, full of\nall those things recorded in Romans Chapter1 v1832. The picture given by this passage\nfrom the Bible rings true, especially today. How amazing\nthat you and your readers \u2014\nintellectual people, can look for\nfulfillment in so many ways, and\nmiss the one pathway which leads to abundant life, and all other\nroads lead to death. Indeed, man\nis already dead, and will only\nfind life in Jesus Christ. It is\nconceivable that this does not\ninterest you \u2014 fair enough, you\nhave made your choice, but I feel\nbound to warn you that if you\nblaspheme the name of Jesus\nChrist, you are likely to receive\npunishment both in this life and\nthe next. If you choose to shut\nyour eyes to the facts, you have\nmade your decision \u2014 but don't complain that you did not have\nany idea of what you were doing.\nRomans chapter1 is worth studying \u2014 in fact a group of\ncivil engineers meet on Tuesdays\nPage 2 FEUX, February 6,1981\n\n"

    "content": "Matters\nRaised\nThe Threat of Rape\nThe recent 'ether' attack in the mews behind\nSouthside has again highlighted the problems of\nsecurity in the area, a subject which has been\nwidely discussed since the rape in the basement\nlast May. Since then the security guard system\nhas been rearranged, and there is now one guard\npermanently on duty on the Main Entrance, and\ntwo doing internal patrols (including Weeks and\nLinstead) and also random external patrols,\nwhich are currently concentrated on the area and\ntime of the last attack. The structural alterations\ninclude stopping the lifts from travelling to the\nbasement, and placing convex mirrors in the Hall\nentrances so that every corner of the entrance\nhall is visible from the door. Unfortunately, the\nmain alteration, which is the blocking of routes\nfrom Stan's Bar to the Halls by means of\nelectronically locking doors, has been held up at\nthe planning stage and is awaiting approval from\nthe Estates Department. When this is done,\nseven doors (which can't be locked conventionally as they are fire escape doors) will be\nlocked electronically, the circuit being broken to\nallow an escape route when the fire alarm is\nsounded. The net result will be that everyone\nentering or leaving the Bar/TV Lounge area will\nhave to go past the main Security Guard.\nUntil that happens however, the only way to\navoid further attacks is not to provide the\nattacker with the chance to make them, i.e., DONT PUT YOURSELF AT RISK. Whether\nyou live in Southside, or are just travelling around\nthe campus, the following points should be\ncarried out to minimise the risk of attack.\nDON'T walk alone at any time after dark.\nRemember that it's not just late night that's dangerous \u2014 the last attack was at 10:00pm, and\nhe'd probably been waiting around for quite a while.\nIF you must walk alone, stick to proper roads\nand well-lit areas. DONT walk across churchyards or un lit gardens, or cut through side streets\nand mews.\nCHECK the mirrors in the Hall entrances\nbefore you get inside and if you see a man you\ndon't recognise, especially hanging around in\ncorners, then WAIT until they've gone before you\nenter (but make sure you don't follow them into\nthe lift). If they don't go within a reasonable time\nalert the Security Guard.\nDON'T go into the basement areas of\nSouthside (e.g. the routes from Stan's to the\nhalls) alone late at night. Remember this is where\nthe May rape took place, even though it is within\nearshot of people in the Bar/TV Lounge area.\nIF you feel particularly worried, you can buy a 'shrill' alarm from me, price \u00a34.50, to carry with\nyou in case of attack.\nMost of all be alert to the possibility of attack\nand follow these suggestions. DONT think it\n'won't happen to me' \u2014 because it might.\nTelly Trouble\nHistorically speaking, House Committee decided\nlast year that \"there was no longer a need for the\nTV Lounge on the third floor, bearing in mind that\nthe TV area in Southside is a Union area\" (I quote\nfrom the minutes of March 10, 1980). Malcolm\nwas of the opinion that there was simply no\ndemand for the service, but I have had reports\nthat the bad reception on the set (which Malcolm\nwas apparently unaware of) was probably the\nreason for this. (I can't find anyone else who\nthinks it was vandalised, Steve.)\nFor the moment may I remind you all that there\nis a Union TV Lounge in Southside (next door to\nStan's Bar) and that Beit TV Lounge is for Beit\nresidents only and is definitely NOT a general\nUnion area which anyone has access to.\nHowever, if there is a clear demand for aTV in\nthe Union Building I will ask House Committee to\nconsider installing one, so if you have strong\nfeelings either way please come and let me know,\nso I can gauge opinion on this subject.\nSaturday, February 7\nInter-Hall Rag Collection\nThursday, February 12\ninter-Departmental Pedal Car Race\nSaturday, February 14\nGuilds & IF Valentines Party\nFriday, February 20\nCarnival in aid of Nightline\nYour social reps should be organising teams for\nthe Pedal Car Race, or get in touch with Tony\nHeales.

IC then allowed\nGoldsmiths far too much of the ball and the\nresulting pressure brought two fine saves out\nof Williams in the IC goal. A quick break close\nto half-time, however, made it 2-0 to IC with\nLay again appearing to complete a fine move.\nDuring the second half IC controlled the\ngame well with any Goldsmith's efforts being\nsolidly stopped by the defence of Dunhilll,\nLakin, Griffiths, and Beer. Fine running from\nMerritt, Saunders and Hartland exposed the\nGoldsmith's defence on many occasions and\ncreated several good chances. The third IC\ngoal came midway into the second half when\na through ball left Hartland with the keeper to\nbeat. This he did, and then added to his total\nwith a headed goal near full-time.\nTEAM: Williams, Dunhill, Beer, Armstrong,\nLakin, Griffiths, Esberger, Lay, Merritt,\nHartland, Saunders.\nJim Beer\nVolleyball\nTHIS convincing win lacked some of the\nexcitement of our recent league matches but\nhas however carried us into the semi-finals of\nthe London Colleges Tournament.

As\nrevenge for writing such dildo articles, I have rearranged\nall of the remaining paragraphs. The point is, can you\ntell?\nNow an abject apology. We're very very sorry\nthat Santa got cancelled. It wasn't our fault,\nhonest. If it was not cancelled, ignore what I just\nsaid. Amazing was it not? I'm sure all who saw it\nare still singing the title song. If it wasn't cancelled.\nWell, this is already the longest bulletin ever (do\nyou believe that?) so I think I 'll wind it up.

Tail High Brother!(Anyone\nrecognising that last allusion should be ashamed\nof themselves.)\nChrist and the man in black\nAnd now, for those of you who spotted the\npunchline in the last bulletin, here is the joke to go\nwith it.\nAND YOU MAY find yourself writing an SF Sock bulletin. And you may find yourself behind a large white sheet of paper. And you find yourself\nin a beautiful lecture theatre, . . . with a beautiful\nlecturer (though, it's not very likely). And you\nmay ask yourself, do unicorns have right-hand\nscrew or left-hand screw horns? But changing the\nsubject faster than Denis Howe's hair can be dyed\nthe most-read club bulletin in FELIX (that's this\none, you doubters) moves zestfully to this week's competition. If anyone out there can explain why\nin a recent Dr Who episode, the good doctor (and\nthat's not Isaac) jumped from one side of a mirror\nto the other instantaneously, did nothing in\nexactly the right way and spent an interminable\namount of time wandering about black and white\nphotographs of English stately homes, write to\nMalaclypse the Elder c/o Phys Dept (use\npigeonhole Q). Address the envelope \"Why am I leaving this in pigeonhole Q competition\".\nNext film up is the Rocky Horror Picture Show\nDon't forget our wonderful library. The Haldane\nis good, but we have titles it does not, and no\n\u2022fixed borrowing time limit. Not to mention a copy\nof On Wings of Song by Tom Disch.

More details from Sean Coyle, Elec Eng 2, or\ncome to our Monday meeting (see below).\nOld Clothes: We are organising a collection of\nold clothes from people in the area to give to\nthose sleeping rough in London (on the Soup\nRun). If you can spare any time this Saturday\n(February 7) to knock on doors and ask for\ndonations, please meet in the Southside TV Lounge at 10:00am. Don't Forget: We meet every Monday at about\n12:35pm in the ICCA G Room, top floor of Union\nBuilding (turn left at top of stairs).\nNewcomers are always welcome (however\nmuch you want to get involved). Free coffee!\nBookshop Bulletin\nEach week, I hope to publish a list of the new\nfiction titles in the bookshop together with our\nbest sellers, usually paperbacks. This week, the\nBrandt Report \u2014 \"North South\", is selling very\nwell, as it links up with the series of four lectures\nheld at College.\nWhen possible, we will be offering books for\nsale at \"bargain\" prices. The main title this week\nis the \"Four Seasons Cookery Book\" by Margaret\nCosta (originally published at \u00a315, we are selling it\nfor \u00a36.95). This book is for people who care about\nusing foods in season. The beginner will find\nsound and carefully explained recipes, and for the\nexperienced cook a treasury of imaginative ideas.\nKeep your eyes peeled for further Bookshop\nbulletins.\nRoy Hicks Bookshop Manager\nAstrosoc\nTHIS IS JUST A QUICK WORD to inform all\nmembers and would-be members of Astro Soc\nthat there will be a coffee evening on Tuesday,\nFebruary 10 at 7:00pm, in the Staff Common\nRoom on Level 8 of the Blackett Laboratory for\nanyone interested in observing. We hope that the\nsix-inch and eight-inch telescopes will be working\nby then, so, if the weather is fine, you will have a chance to see for yourselves the equipment\navailable through Astrosoc. There should be an\nopportunity to discuss future projects in\nobserving with both the committee and other\nmembers. Also, although this may seem a bit like\nbribery, we'd like to emphasize both coffee and\nbiscuits will be free!\nThere are also a few alterations to the\nprogramme published in last week's FELIX: Dr\nGarry Hunt's lecture on 'The Voyager Project' is\non the 19 NOT the 13 of February as stated, Dr\nJohn Taylor has also had to cancel this term's lecture due to a more important commitment, but\ninstead we have Patrick Moore coming on\nFebruary 27, when he will be lecturing in Physics\n1 at 6:00pm. No doubt Dr Taylor will be lecturing\nsome time next term when he has a free day, but\nin the meantime we can look forward to Dr Brian\nMorgan of our own Astronomy Department\nlecturing in Lecture Theatre 3 on March 12 at\n1:00pm. We hope you will come to as many of these\nlectures as possible, but, most important of all,\ndon't forget the coffee evening, Astro-Soc won't be Astro-Soc unless someone takes an interest in\nobserving.\nFEUX, February 6,1981 Page 5\n\n"

They often have\nunpleasant traits such as crying a lot, fussing or\nbeing very physically weak. Often they are\nexpected to do jobs such as cooking, washing and\ncleaning. When a girl does play the main role in a story they often have to overcome dreadful\nobstacles such as blindness, illness, before they\nget some reward such as fame or popularity.\nThese clearly put over the message that girls are\ninferior.\nThe meeting on Thursday will be at 6:30pm in\nthe Green Committee Room.

They also run an office in New\nYork to provide help to the participants, should\nthey need it.\nMembers have the choice of working of a kids'\nsummer camp, or of finding their own job\nanywhere they like. Those who choose to work at\na camp have the further choice of whether to look\nafter the children (it helps if you are the outgoing\ntype), or working in the kitchen and maintenance\nside. Those who choose to work on a camp have\neverything arranged for them. However, those\nmembers on the second scheme have to arrange\ntheir own jobs themselves, although BUN AC does publish its own exclusive job-directory to\nhelp them. The idea of all the schemes is that\nmembers should be able to break even overall if\nthey wish.\nInterested?

    "content": "Founded in1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union Aaaaaa aaa aar rrr rrr rh!! Thursday's Union General Meeting was stopped after less\nthan half an hour, when the quorum was successfully\nchallenged by Stephen Goulder. As a result of the repeated\nin quo racy of UGMs, Liz Lindsay is setting up a new working\nparty, which she hoped would contain Owen Greene, Steve\nGoulder, William Cortazzi, and Mark Clegg, to investigate\nmethods of promoting the attendance at such meetings.\nThese pec ple had complained about the Executive's performance, and the running of the UGM at the meeting.\nThe meeting opened at 1:05pm to a less than half full Great Hall. After the minutes of the last meeting were accepted, Owen Greene\nmoved that the order of business be changed to place the motion on\nnuclear disarmament immediately after the President's report, so as he\nand others could go to a nuclear le cut re that was also given last term.\nThis was voted on, but as the result was close, a hand count was taken.\nThe results was 46-50 against the motion. The most controversial part\nof the President's report concerned the Ultra Vires issue (see page\nthree). Mr Passmore explained that he would not affiliate ICU to any\norganisation until he was informed by the Union Solicitor that such\naction was definitely not illegal. Owen Greene said he should have\ntaken more action on the motions that were passed. He argued that\nthere was hardly a students' union in the country that wasn't affiliated\nto something or other.\nWilliam Cort azzi complained about the small turnout at the\n\u2022SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS8SS\nRed Baron joins\nCrazy Gang!\nLORD FLOWERS, Rector of Imperial College since 1973, has declared\nhis support for the Social Democratic faction in the current internal\nwrangle in the Labour Party. The\" Council for Social Democracy\", in\na half-page advertisement in yesterday's Guardian, listed a selection of\none hundred people who had pledge their support to the Council \u2014\nLord Flowers described merely as a \"physicist\", was included in the\nlist. Although Lord Flowers hasn't studied any physics for some years\nnow, this is more accurate than that of the Guardian, which to g ged him\nas a \"sociologist\".\nThe Council for Social Democracy was founded with the Labour Party lay four right wing Labour politicians (Dr David Owen, MP, William Rogers, MP, Shirley Williams and Roy Jenkins) following the\nrecent change in the way the Labour party is elected. The changes,\nwhich give trade unions and local Labour party organisations a much\nlarger part in the vote, represent a strong swing to the left in the party\norganisation. The announcement of this list of supporters comes amidst\ngrowing speculation on the possibility of a break by the Social\nDemocrats from the Labour party and the setting up of a new party.\nAs well as Lord Flowers, the list includes a variety of people, among\nthe trade union leaders, University lecturers, and the President of Cambridge Students' Union. meeting. Liz Lindsay said that they had publicised the meeting to the\nsame extent as previous meetings. William Cort azzi said the Exec were\nelected to office to do a job, and he did not think they were doing it\nproperly if so few people turned out. Mark Clegg suggested that posters\nshould be stuck in student houses in Evelyn Gardens. Liz Lindsay\ntook this as an offer to do this, but Mark Clegg said she had misunderstood him. After a proposal to move to next business, the\nPresident's report was accepted.\nDare Afolabi then moved that the order of business should be\nchanged to have the motion on the Brandt Report (advocating greater\nawareness of the findings) considered next. This was rejected on a vote.\nThe Deputy President, in her report, emphasised that the Beit TV Lounge was not for use by the whole Union. There was a Union TV Lounge in Southside next to Stan's Bar.\nAfter her report was accepted, William Cort azzi moved that the El Salvador motion should be considered next, as it would be more\ninteresting. This proposal was defeated on a vote.\nIn the Hon See's report Liz Lindsay emphasised that she wanted\npeople to contact her with a view to writing a paper on 'Preparation\nfor Scientific or Technical Degrees'. Those interested should contact\nher as soon as possible, she said.\nWhen the meeting moved to the returning officers report, Steve\nGoulder said that he could not let an in quo rate meeting elect a Union Officer. Therefore, he called quorum. It was obvious that not even 150\npeople were there, well less than the requisite 300 for a quo rate meeting, so the meeting was stopped.\nCaroline Waitt, from Nightline had come t q_ speak to the meeting,\nso most of those at the meeting waited to hear what she had to say.\nShe said that Nightline would be moving to number nine Princes\nGardens from number ten over the Easter vacation. She emphasised\nthat Nightline was not a political, religious, or counselling service, but\nwas always willing to listen to those who wanted to talk to them \u2014\nabout anything. Nightline had an extensive information service\ncovering entertainment, in London and other colleges, medical services\nand most other things. She hoped people would buy tickets for the\nGuilds Special Benefit concert, including bands and a disco to be held\non February 20.\nAfter this, those still in the Great Hall left, having been told to take\ntheir rubbish with them.\nLiz Lindsay issue a statement to FELIX later. She said: \" Iam setting up a Working Party to discuss the promotion of attendance at\nUG Ms. Those especially invited to attend are Owen Greene, Steve\nGoulder, William Cortazzi, and Mark Clegg, as these people expressed\npar icu lar concern about the poor attendance at today's meeting.\nAnyone else is also more than welcome to attend. It is proposed to hold\nthe meeting at 12:45pm on Monday, February 23 in my office.\"\nShe blamed the low attendance on exams and milk round interviews\ngoing on at the time. She said last week's FELIX had not helped, as it\nsuggested the meeting would be in quo rate. Although she had asked\nSteve Marshall to include an advertisement for the meeting he had not\ndone so. Mr Marshall claimed it was he who pointed out to Liz Lindsay that the date of the meeting should be changed.\nHe thought last week's article was good publicity for the meeting\nand he'd make sure all FELIX readers were aware that the next\nU GM would be the Sabbatical Election Hustings Meeting on March5 in the Great Hall at 1:00pm No. 575 Friday, February 6,1981 Free!\n\n"

CND\nAffiliation\nBombshell\nTHE ICU EXECUTIVE may\nbe liable to be sued if the Union becomes affiliated to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.\nA motion was passed at the\nend of the last term advocating\nsuch affiliation, but Mr Passmore\nwas advised by a student that by\npaying money to such an organ-is ation, he would be acting beyond his legal powers. If that is\nso, both himself, and the Executive, would be acting illegally,\nand liable in court, if the matter\nwas taken that far. It is thought\nthat a precedent was set in this\nmatter in a1972 court case when\na student successfully sued his\nUnion. Mr Passmore has spoken to\nMichael Arthur, Union Welfare\nAdvisor, and is currently pursuing the matter with the Union Solicitor. He hopes that the\nSolicitor's advice will be accepted\nby Union members.\nUntil such time as he is\nadvised that such affiliation does\nnot constitute a breach of his\npowers, Mr Passmore will not\npay monies to any organisation.\nMr Passmore pointed out that\nUnion societies such as political\ngroups, could not use Union money to a ff i late to other political parties or national groups.\nAny money for this would have\nto be raised through subscriptions. Brewers\nDroop\nAREA LA LE promotional night\nwas held in Stan's Bar in Southside on Tuesday evening.\nOne thousand pints of Taylor Walker Real Ale were on sale,\npriced at 30p per pint. A large\nnumber of people attended the\nevent, and Stan's was crowded\nfor most of the evening.\nSome people have since criticised the cheap beer, complaining that it was very weak; \" As weak as gnats' piddle,\" was how\none unhappy punter described it.\nRao Snee. Deputy President,\ntold FELIX that she thought the\nevent had been worthwhile, as\nthose people (here had enjoyed it.\nIt meant that there were more\npeople in Stan's than usual. There was a barrel left at the end\nof the evening, but she did not\nagree this meant the real ale to be\num pop tt lar even at the low price.\nThe Bar Committee would be\nlooking into having more eve-ning s, and contacting brewers to\nI that end, she said.\nCollege Wide Ballots\nImperial accused of \"destroying ULU\"\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION received a derogatory report in\nLondon Student last week. The report, entitled \" No to Campus Wide Ballot\", was one of a debate at the University of London Union Student Representative Council,( although the article does not\nmention this location). A motion to elect UL U's three sabbatical\nofficers by campus-wide ballot was rejected.\nJohn Passmore, ICU President, and proposer of the motion, did not\nfeel that the ninety person S RC could properly represent a university\nof 48,000. He thought the University-wide ballot would b; more\ndemocratic.\nRich McMahon of the Institute of Education is reported in London\nStudent as arguing that \" Imperial[ College Union] was not concerned\nabout democracy at all, but simply wanted a system which would\ncollapse, destroying UL U and helping to des toy all student unions\".\nThe motion was defeated by fifty-four votes to thirty-seven.\nMr Passmore told FELIX that Rich McMahon, whom hi regarded\nas a \"Trotskyist\" and a\" raving politico\" was laughed at by the S RC meeting when he accused ICU of wanting to \"destroy all student\nunions\". He flatly denied that either he, or the Union had such a wish.\nAnna Clarke, UL U President and oppose r of the motion, told\nFELIX she realised having a cross-campus ballot would give larger\ncolleges, such as IC,a larger share of the vote, instead of one vote per\nCollege as at present. This would favour a candidate from a larger\ncollege who would be likely to be able to sway his own college to vote\nfor him.\nFirstThe Last Waltz\nTHE C&G UNION Dinner and Dance, held at the Royal Garden Hotel, Kensington, last Friday night, finished early, to the\ndisappointment of many people at the Dinner.\nThis was the first year that the event was held outside College. Many of the guests assembled in Sloane's Cocktail Bar in Knightsbridge\nbefore going on to the Hotel. The evening's pro ceding s passed\npeacefully, until Simon Shaw, Guilds Entertainments Officer, announced at 1:00pm that the Dancing would be cut short. After only\ntwo records, the disco was stopped and the evening ended at 1:30am on Saturday morning. The bar had closed an hour earlier than\nexpected, and the whole event was over one and a half hours sooner\nthan had been originally planned. The executive had known about the\nearly closure since the day before the event. They had been informed\nthat the police had withdrawn the Hotel's licence for holding late\nfun c it on s, but they did not officially publicise this until near the end of\nthe evening. This caused some dissatisfaction amongst a number of\npeople, mainly because they were told of the early finish just two\ndances before it occurred.\nDave Gayor, Guilds President, told FELIX that he thought the\nevening was better than could have been provided in College, but that\nGuilds should think twice about so many people in Sloane's again,\nwhich only served to cause confusion and delay (see letters' page).\nThe Navy Lark\nLAST TUESDAY evening an invited audience of two hundred\nstudents and staff gathered in Me chEng220 to hear a lecture by the\nRoyal Navy Presentation Team, led by Capt David Morse, on\nBritain's maritime interests and the role and future of the Royal Navy. The purpose of the lecture, which is repeated round the country, was\nto inform people why it is considered necessary to spend \u00a33,050ma year on the Navy. Capt Morse, backed up by films and slides, began by explaining that\nBritain was dependent on the sea for economic and trading reasons,\nsince we are not self-sufficient, especially in food supplies.\nBritain, currently spends j fl0.5 billion a year on defence, but even\nspending this huge amount, we could not defend ourselves alone\nagainst attack, which is why we belong to the fifteen-member NATO, contributing 55,000 troops to the defence of West Germany in any\nwar. The Navy would in wartime come under NATO command.\nIndustry benefited to the tune of \u00a31,000m this year in Naval business; this includes development of missiles, 'un jam mable' radar,\nand torpedoes.\nSumming up, Capt Morse said we face a continuing threat from the\nSoviet Union, who appear unwilling as yet to disarm, and this is one\nreason for maintaining the Navy.

Continued pressure led to a fine try by fly-half, Hughes Nar borough after a scrum inside Roehampton's twenty-two metre line.\nThe try was converted.\nIC then began to relax a little and allowed\nRoehampton to get back into the game with a penalty given away in front of the posts.\nHowever, the driving play of the pack soon\nled to a further score by O 'Docherty on the\nright wing after third phase possession had\nbeen won. This was also well converted.\nThe second half showed the IC forwards to\nbe well in command in all phases of play. The\nrolling maul was particularly effective against\nan opposition who tended to stand off,\nusually offside, and wait for the ball to be fed\nto the IC backline. However, invariably any\nmoves would break down just before the\nRoehampton try-line.\nRoehampton scored a break-away try from\ntheir own line following a speculative clearance into open space and very lucky\nbounce of the ball.\nIC countered with some very tight forward\nplay to ensure a1210 victory; something that\nwas worked hard for, but was never really in\nany doubt from the kick-off.\nTEAM: Chirpy Thrale, o 'Docherty, Davies,\nWall, Spring, Hughes-Narborough, Slug, Bell,\nBall, Kirby, Bradley, Tool, Davies, Stear,\nChulkin.\nFootball Fourths\nWITH a couple of changes the Fourths faced\nup to Holloway who they had previously\nbeaten 7-2 earlier in the season. After a scrappy start to the game by both sides IC fell\nbehind after ten minutes. This goal resulted in\na more positive approach from the Fourths\nand they soon levelled the score when a Burns shot found the corner of the net.\nA second goal quickly followed when after\na good run Marlon rounded the opposing\ngoalkeeper and pushed the ball into the net.\nDolan increased the lead when after a good\nthrough ball he hit a first time shot past the\nadvancing keeper.\nFollowing a good save from Holloway's keeper Burns scored again when his shot was\ndeflected into the net. Just before half-time\nIC scored their fifth when, following a Marlon\nshot, the ball seemed to be on the line, but\nGraves tapped it into the net.\nIn the second half Holloway were under\nconstant pressure but a twenty yard shot\nfrom Dolan was the only addition to the\nscore. IC were unlucky to see good attempts\nsaved on the line. At the back Hampton\nplaying on goal looked com pet ant on the odd\noccasion he touched the ball, and fullbacks\nMaddy and Milner defended well and had\ngood runs up their wings.\nTEAM: Hampton, Maddy, Milner, Chown,\nVeats, Buckley, Graves, Dolan, McNicholas,\nBurns, Marlon.\nHockey Firsts\nIMPERIAL'S start to probably the most\nimportant game of the season was disastrous.\nKodak, moving the ball around fluently,\napplied all the pressure in the opening ten\nminutes and gained a well deserved goal.\nThey continued to create problems for the rest\nof the first half for Imperial who lacked any\nsort of rhythm and it was only sure fire saves\nby keeper Butler and clearances from Coatsworth and Hughes that prevented a worse half-time score line. Imperial fought\nback in the second half 'and soon after a missed penalty flick by Clarke Bell slotted\nhome a neat cross. With only two minutes to\ngo Cope netted the ball after a scramble at\nthe top of the 'D' to place Imperial firmly at\nthe the top of the league.\nTEAM: Butler, Coatsworth, Davey, Gatley,\nRich, Bell, Franklin, Hughes, Riley, Clarke\nCope.\nHockey Seconds\nTHIS was our first league game this term, and\na good result was necessary to keep our\nleague position respectable, and to restore\nteam morale after several disappointing results.\nFrom the start it was clear that IC were a much better side than E TESSA and it was\nonly an effective off-side trap which our\nattack repeatedly fell for, that prevented us\nscoring early in the match. IC controlled the\nmidfield, and it was only a matter of time\nbefore Chew, fresh from his 'short' Christmas\nbreak in Malaya, opened the scoring. This\nwas followed soon after by a very good opportunist goal by Whittaker, which took\nus to half-time with a20 lead. One of the\numpires however had other ideas. The boots\nof some of our players were deemed illegal\nsince they had metal studs, and to avoid\nplaying the second half with a group of\nbarefooted players, the side fia d to be\nreshuffled so that the 'culprits' played on the\nopposite side of the field to this umpire. As a result the second half became scrappy and\ndespite this IC held on to win their first match\nthis term, and thus earn two valuable points.\nTEAM: Jones, Masom (Capt), Bird, Shaw\nCliH, Chew, Rao, Whittaker, Cornwell, Gray,\nWebb, Stroomer.\nNeil Masom\nSailing\nTen Pin\nLAST SATURDAY the Bowling Club sent\nthree teams to the Brunei Handicap Tournament.\nKnight and Ng finished their six games with\na score of 1966.\nLau and Mac Go wan started excellently\nwhen Mac Go wan bowled a234 to take high\nhandicap game. With a203 from Lau and a2165 score over six games, they came third in\nthe scratch tournament.\nWells and Cook won the high team handicap game when Wells bowled a200( his\nfirst) and Cook bowled a178. A final score of\n1795 gave them third place in the handicap\ntournament.\nChris Wells\nTHE IC team were again successfully defeating all opposition at Brent on Saturday.\nIn a very light wind they showed their versatility by winning, in two races, their\nfourth successive match. This time against\nCity University.\nIn the first race although the members of\nthe team sailed well, the team as a whole\nsailed badly. Kennedy Gate started the race\nand the situation then dictated that each\nboat search for wind where it would. So\nalthough there were fights for individual places, most notably by Chadwick who eventually finished first, little of the teams\nnew-found racing skill was displayed. The\nresult was IC first, third and fifth.\nIn the second race however the teams hida better measure of the conditions and fi eir enthusiasm grew. The first heat re sui fad in\none IC boat and all the City boats colliding at\nthe first mark and although the IC team could\npossibly have held first, second and sixth, to\nwin, they returned to help Kennedy the sixth\nman and after a nice peice of sailing just\nbefore the finish by Mills finally finished\nsecond, third and fourth to gain more useful\nleague points.\nTEAM: Allport, Chadwick, Kennedy, Mills,\nRedman, Woodhouse.\nSunday, February 1,1981\nHockey Mixed v Inst of Ed 2-1\nRugby\nLadies v UCL08 Ten Pin\nIC v Brunei 0-10\nSwimming\nIC v Bristol 52-67\nSwimming\nLAST WEEKEND the IC Swimming Team\nwent to Bristol University for the annual IC v Bristol Gala.\nThe Women's Team was stronger than\nprevious years, Wilton (Captain) swimming\nwell to win the ladies breast stroke. The ladies\nalso won both the medley and freestyle\nrelays.\nThe Men's Team did not do very well, even\nthough Heffeman won the backstroke, and\nBoucher the individual medley, Nicholas Last\ngiving a good fight for second place.\nMaybe the men were beaten in the relays as\nthey were saving their strength for the\nfollowing water polo match.\nTEAM: Wilton, Wooley, Hillier, Hammond,\nBrown, Leach, Porter, Hefernan, Ashwin,\nLast, Bradley, Boucher and Durodie.\nI would like to say thank you to David\nRoberts who drove us to Bristol and back\nagain (in the fog) and put up with the noise\n(Sue!) in the back.\nTen Pin\nLAST SUNDAY saw the last Inter-University\nLeague match of this academic year. The\nmatch was played against Brunei, at the Airport\nBowl near Heathrow. Brunei have a strong\nside and showing good form on the day beat\nthe Imperial side which showed good spirits\nand although the A team did not bowl as well\nas was expected the B,C and Ladies teams\nfought well agian st superior opposition. The\nImperial stars were Knight and Quinn, from\nthe A and B teams respectively, who bowled\nvery respectable series. Thanks must also go\nto Marker and Ellis who made up the C team\nnumbers, fortunately.\nFELIX, February 6,1981 Page 7\n\n"
