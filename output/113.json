    "content": "FELIX PROFILE\np mm*\nwi it if lts Pi \u00a7111\nOGGI\nIn October 1952, a fresher named\nBrian Henrn arrived at I.C. Pew could\nhave realised at the time that here was\nthe biggest enigma that I.C. has ever\nknown: one d ny the quiet and bashful\nBrian, another the extroverted clown\nOgad: one day a great rug ger player,\nanother a picture of lolling incompetence: one minute sober, a minute later\nreeling drunk on a couple of tomato\njuices.\nBefore Baster 1955, the name Oggi\nmeant nothing to I.C. But at that time\nthe I.C. Bugger Club undertook its first tour of Brian's home county of\nCornwall, and Brian waxed long and vehement on the qualities of the Cornish\nnational Dish, the \"Ogjd\" which consists\nof \"great lun ros of potato surrounded by\nstodgy pastry, Just like yourself, Brian?\nFrom that moment the name was Oggi, and\nit stuck.\nThe cult of Oargl grew. In late November 1955, a student from I.C. swam the\nThames, and a DAILY KAIL front-page headline read OCCY SWIMS IHAMSS FOB A BET.\nwith a suitable article beneath. A month\nor so later the BVENING STANDARD carried\na headline TOMAHAWKS FLY AT COLLEGE BALL,\nfollowed by an astonishing description\nof the Guilds Carnival where \"..squaws\nand Indian chiefs danced round 20 ft totem poles. One chief swung his tomahawk too exuberantly and accidentally\nscalped engineering student Brian Oggi.\nwho was rushed' to St 3e or ge's Hospital1\n;\nYet this Is the Golden Boy of I.C. Bugger. Brilliant but unpredictable,\none day the Lester Piggott ef Harlington, the next Coco the Clown (whom he\nclosely resembles when attired in his\nbaggy blue pyjamas), with a horrible\nhabit of dropping the ball or falling' flat on his back when about to score sir j. In ths Cup matches of 1955-56, he\nscored 18 of I.C.'s24 points against\nKing's and claimed all6 in the final against U.C. Two weeks ago he scored\n14 points in I.C.'s first round win by\n20-3. On another occasion the Wasps\nwere so sm used Vy his antics that they\nadvised him to sign up for ths Harlem\nGlobetrotters.\nAs aer ioke ter, too, he is a model\nof brilliant inconsistency. Five maiden\novers may be followed by two of rank\nlong hops. With the bat he can be a dominant figure, as when scoring 59 in40 minutes to snatch a glorious one-wicket victory against B.B.C. Plymouth\nin1956. Two days later at Torquay he\nskied the ball twice and was dropped,\nthen was clean bowled while over-balancing in his efforts to hit a full toss\nout of the ground. Hs is the only I.C. Captain who has declared at lunch in an\nall-day game and than withdrawn his dec-la ration, Oggi spent three years in the Hostel,\nwhere his activities frequently loomed\nlarge in the miserable life of the Ward*\nen. The culmination of his twentieth\nbirthday party was a procession round\nKensington, headed by an accordion play\u00bb\ner and followed by a record number of\nneighbour ly complaints. Oggi miraculously\nsurvived this and there was speculation\nas to whether his hostel life would be\nprolonged beyond his twenty-first as\nwell. But this immortal occasion saw all his guests recumbent at an early hour,\nincluding Sunday disciplinarians. Oggi\nis still a welcome visitor to the Old\nHostel, as J. Hoeksma and F. Irving will testify. Oggi gained a2nd in Chemical Engineering in'55 \u2014\"spent too much time\nplaying cricket\" \u2014 and is now a learned\nresearch student. His apparatus contains\na capacitance bridge, the balance-point\nbeing found when the humming note in the\nloud-speaker reaches a minimum. It was\nwholly in keeping that at first this\nspeaker emitted the B.B.C. Home Service\nwhile his radio back at ths digs emitted only a screech.\nHis hobbies include sketching and\nwriting poetry about \"human wreckage\ndrifting hopelessly through the streets'!\n\" All the world's a stage\" and Oggi is one of its greatest comics. Certainly\nI.C. would be 'Hie poorer without his\nbon homie and good humour.\nI.C.

Ths sordid\njustness of the scraping will thus remain\nout of sight and perhaps out of mind. The\n'.rollers will no longer be required, and\nthe diners will be caused the minimum\namount of trouble. This is surely more\nsatisfactory than the present arrangement.\nMr. Hallgarten la a regular visitor to\nthe Society; his Germanic countenance and\ngut t mrs lit y of speech enable him to convey\nthe atmosphere of Ehinelsnd to his listeners.\nHe rendered great assistance in explaining the hieroglyphics whl sn inevitably\nappear on all German wine bottles.

The photographic exhibits,\nmainly the work of Tony Eycott, attracted a large number of people. The\nphotograph of the midnight sun (by A.

    "content": "6 FELIX ROOM DECOR\nIt Is often said that students of\nso ien ti fic and tee hno logi o al sub jeet s are Just human robots and lack the Invagination and artistic sense essential\nto rounded personalities. Of course this\nis just a lot of propaganda put out by\nnarrow minded people with so called\n\" classical\" educations.\nOf course we are not machines without the gift of original thought. Ton\nhare only to call on any member of the\nI.C. Hostel for instance, to see how by\neager endeavour his artistic temperament\nis explored to the full expressed in the decoration of his room.\nThis form of artistic expression is only begotten by experience over the\nfirst year or two of college life. In order to promote this trait the author\nhas here a few suggestions to make concerning the more popular types of decoration suitable for student bedrooms,\n'though it must be emphasised that ori gina lit y of idea is an essential part\nof the whole thing.\nBeer mats are perhaps easiest to ob-tain, - you can pick up one or two at\neach new pub. you visit and you will be\nsurprised how soon the space round the\ntop of your wall gets filled up.\nPosters of any size or description\ngive colour and interest to your room.\nTravel posters can be obtained at most\nnational travel agencies around Picca dilly but you may have to use some\ntact in getting them since the available\nstocks soon run low In the Autumn. The\nbest way is to say that you are a geography teacher and want them to illustrate your lessons to the kiddies.\nTheatre posters and programmes add\ndistinction to the room as do tube train adverts and college hop and carnival\nnotices but in the latter case take care\nnot to remove them before the function\nadvertised is over.\nunfortunately certain people in Senate\nHouse have made the a quis it ion of blue\nhelmets and bus stop signs rather harder\nthan a few years ago but naturally this\ngives the a quis it ion even more value.\nColoured cartoons from P HCH and other\nmagazines can be used at a pinch but cutouts from the EsQ,\u2014E calendar are more\npleasing to the (male) eye. However, if you are entertaining Aunt Fanny to tea\nin the future, these had better be detachable .\nThis brings up the thorny problem\nof removal of such decorations. Some\nlandladies actually ob jeet to their\nceilings being plastered with full length portraits of Ava Gardner and\nnay even have forestalled you with decorations of their .own such as not ios s bearing the legend \"Lodgers will be\nhold responsible tor any damage to property through the fixing of ornaments\netc. thereon.\" There are three things\nyou o an do in a oas e like this:-1. Have no decorations at all and\nwat oh the wallpaper peel off of it's own accord.\n2. Experiment with various forms of\nadhesive on the part of the wall least\nlikely to be noticed by the eagle eye,\n3. Go ahead and let your frustrated\nere at ive instinct have full rein.\nIf you chose no. 3 make sure you have\nother digs fixed up first. If you have some money to spare you\ncan buy one or two reproductions of class ical or modern paintings at several\ngalleries such as the Tate, the Phoenix\nor the Jfedici. A large reproduction will cost something in the region of 15/- or \u00a31\nFor a special occasion why not buy a bunch of flowers? Some real bargains may\nbe had from Covent Garden if you get up\nearly enough. Naturally, members of\nI. C.W. A. have flowers every day(as well\nas goldfish) but I think this is going\na bit too far - although some members\nof I. C.W. A. like going a1 It too far. These are only a few ways of decorating your room, but even the President\nof the Union will no dou by agree, in spite of the euphonium and television\nset in his room, that the best deo oration for any room is the presence of an attractive member of the opposite sax.\nit-HOCKEY CLUB\nI* XI STILL UNBEATEN\nThe l st XI Is still maintaining a100* record, although two of the last four matches have been won only by the odd goal.\nOn Hov. 6th I.C. beat Westminster College 5-0 in Hie first round of the U.L. Cup, The opposition was not strong: our\nchief rivals In the Cup this year are li k ely to be U.C. who we meet in the next\nround on Dec. 4th, On Hov. 9th the l st XI just held on\nto a half-time lead of 3-0 to beat Eeble\nCollege at Oxford by 3-2. This is a reversal of previous matches in which 2nd half ascendancy has been a feature. It shows that we could still be fitter. On SOT, 13th I.C. beat King's30 and on Hov. 16th beat Hendon 2-1 in spite\nof four of our men playing that day for\nthe University.\nBeeerds to date: goals\nP WDL FAl st XI 9 9 0 0 32 7\n2nd XI 7 2 2 3 9 80\n3rd XL 5 3 1 1 13 5\nRAILWAY SOCIETY VISITS RUGBY On the 13th of November ten members\nof the I.C. Hallway Society paid a visit to the Locomotive Test Plant at Rugby.\nAfter an uneventful Journey up to Rugby\nin the \"Royal Scot\" they were first shown\nround the Motive Power Depot, ancient\nbut Interesting, where a number of locomotives in various stages of undress\nwere explored.\nAfter lunch the party went down to\nthe Test Plant. This is a large and :\nhighly specialised laboratory, opened\nin 1948, where any type of locomotive\ncan be tested in every conceivable way.\n(although there are no records of any\nengine - as yet - being tested to des-tru c tion). Although the plant was orig-in ally intended for steam locomotives\nonly, it is now working more and more on\nother types: the one seen on test is still on the secret list and cameras\nwere not allowed.\nSome time was spent in the o on tro l room, which is allegedly soundproof (!)\nand some fascinating gadgets were inspect-ed. Built into the middle of the vast\ncontrol panel (which is loaded with\ninstruments of awesome accuracy) is one\nordinary domestic barometer, labelled\n\"Set fair\" etc. in Te Olde-type letter-ing. One wonders if it says \"Rain\" when\nsteam engines start priming on the bed.\nIt was a delightful and unusual\nvisit, made even better by our particular ly hospitable guide, newly arrived\n(with a number of stories) from Irish Railways.\nTHAT LIFT\nThe lift in the Union la still suffering from periodic disorders which are attributable to nothing more than gross\nover-loading. Csses have occurred of 12\npeople being trapped in it. The lift is built to carry 6, and, if this abuse con-tin ue, action will be taken to prevent a larger number getting in.

    "content": "REBIRTH OF\nTHE PHOENIX\nThe four\", sub-editors of THE PHCENTX\nhave recently drawn up a report on lta present situation. The need for, and aims\nof, THE PHOEHIX are discussed and detailed\nsuggestions made for future improvements.\nProm conversation with students fro a other universities, one gains the impression that I.C. is little more than a rel at iv ely advanced technical e ol leg* \u2014beyond scientific prowess and-e ucc esse' a in the field of sport we are'nothing.\nIt is a prime duty of THE PHOENIX to\ndestroy this conception - those copies\nwhich ire sent to other colleges1 and uni vers i ties must show the other aspects of\nI.C. students, it the same time, however,\nTHE FHOEHTX must be made Interesting and\nattractive to the students themselves.\nTha sub-editors have suggested a considerable number of improvements that they\nthink need to he made before any voluntary\nincrease in circulation can be expected\n(the sales ceiling is about 1700, but actual sales are of the order of 800 at pre-sent) . They propose, among other things,\nthat in future THE PHOEBTX should include\na 'theme' supplement, something after the\nfashion of the spasmodic PUNCH supplements\non the Motor Show, the Close Season, etc.,\npossibly In the form of a16 page dummy\npull-out.\nThe report recommends that in future\narticles should be commissioned from past\nsubscribers, there also being in each\nissue a brief invitation to students to\nsubmit crt i cles. The practice of publicly\nbegging for material is to e ease it serves only to make readers aware of the\npaucity.\nIt is advised that THE PHOEHIX should\nnot attempt to report news, and be more\ncareful with political articles than in the past - In the summer of 1949 it was\nforced to admit that It had been publishing a i ly very left-wing articles. The\nsociety reports should be merged into a single article on College activities, with brief mentions of the outstanding\nevents.\nThere appears to be scope for a more\nImaginative use of space.\"it present every\npage has full width columns, with a title at the top and the author's name at the\nbottom. This suggests a bankruptcy ef imagination on the part of the person responsible for layout? It is suggested that some\npages be divided Into two columns and that\ntype faces and headings should be varied i the cover too should be treated In a more\nei rou la tio u een aoi ou a Banner. Some of these\nsuggestions have been incorporated in the\npresent issue.\nFELIX GUILDSMEN FREED\nThe two Guildsmen arrested in Exhibition Boad on Morphy Bay appeared before the\nmagistrate the following a or ning, charged\nwith insulting behaviour.\nThe constable who gave evidence said\nthat he had seen these two opening a car\ndoor, but one of them then pointed out\nthat the Police had not arrived until15 minutes after the incident. The Polioe did\nin fact admit that the arrested men had ha\nbeen picked oat at random, and the Magistrate had no alternative but to discharge\nthem, which he did. The Magistrate asked the two Cuildsmen\nto report in the College Magazine that\ngood natured rags very seldom gave rise to\nany serious trouble, but hooliganism such\nas this was looked upon very seriously by\ncitizens in general, and by the law in particular: these sentiments are heartily\nendorsed by Dave Stevens.\nHONOUR SATISFIED\nBOAT CLUB IB\" SPOBT RACES V. KING'S In an interesting fixture, which was\nby nature of a duel, the Boat Club completely defeated King's College Boat Club\nboth In water and in beer.\nThe fixture arose in order to regain\nthe Boathouse Plag, which had been stolen\nby members of King's2 nd Till on Morphy\nDay. Five crews participated in the race,\nwhich took place on the afternoon of Wednesday, November 15th, the I.C.3 rd Till and King's2 nd Till having a two lengths'\nstart on the I.

In\nany case, the C.U., with 75 members, is so\nlarge that it must split into e ells if it is to grow There are other Christian\ncells in. he College (Dr Cameron's, and\none or more in R.C.S.) and one, now the\nChurch Society, which grew up as as outpost of the Chaplaincy to U.L. This la tter cell has a new, keen oom n ltte e and a mailing list of 88 Anglieans not in CtU.\nor S.C.H, and we have scarcely started\nlooking for them yet.\nAll we want is permission to use the\nCollege's name, and to use nai ioe bean's and Union rooms. We are not ambitious to\njoin S. C.C., and we intend to raise our\nown maa ey from members.\nYours a in se rely. Peter Evans\nChairman, Church Society.\n\n"

On Tuesday next, in the Concert Hall, the\nRector and Mr Richard Sheppard P. R.I.B.A. will speak at a special College meeting on the plans for Prince's Gardens.\nModels, samples of furniture and a number of photographs\nand drawings will be on view, and Br Sparkea of the planning off ioe will join in answering questions after the\nspeeches.\nThis is the first opportunity that the College has had\nof seeing and hearing the details of \"...this fundamental\nstep in the creation of a new and better Imperial College.\nIn fact, this Is the first 'public' meeting on the Prince's gardens Project, and perhaps it is an indication of Administrative concern that members of the College should be the\nfirst to know of possible future developments. Accordingly\nwe hope that future leaks will come to PBLH rather than to\nthe MANCHESTER GOAHDIAH.\nMR MOONEY\nEXPERIMENTS\nPLANS QUEUE CUTS MT Mooney will shortly begin an experiment to prevent the enormous supper\nqueues which have of late graced the\nLower Refectory. The plan is that he\nwill guarantee a good selection of food\nat any time between 6:00 and 7:30. In\naddition the upper Refectory will now\nremain open until6:30, which should relieve some of the pressure downstairs.\nThe majority of I.C. students will agree that they do not indulge in our\nnative habit of queuing for any patriotic reason: they queue to be sure of a meal, and who o an bla a e them! It Is\nhoped that the experiment will prove\nthat one can eat later and still have a reasonable meal. Once this is assured,\nit is felt that most students will prefer to miss the rash.\nThis queue staggering will benefit\nboth the student and the serving staff.\nIt is earnestly hoped that TOU will cooperate with Mr Mooney in what may prove\nto be a costly experiment.\nAt the recent Refectory Committee\nmeeting the ole aria g of refuse was also\nextensively discussed; the present system\nef as raping the greasy remains from the\nplates sate the trolley is very un pleas ant, a ffe a A ing to the eye, the car and 1hc nose, fas presence of the trolleys Is also\nan oo e uae tie Bel has ard for tray-bear lf students.\nSB page\nAn Exhibition was staged in Senate House\nlast week devoted to the planning of both\nacademic and residential buildings in Universities. The soo pe was wide and covered\nthe whole of the western world, ranging\nfrom English Redbrick, through Scandinavian\nColleges to the massive State and Private\nUniversities of the United States.\nAs far as London University was o ono er ned the sole example of their expansion and\nrebuilding programme was Imperial's development plan for residential accommodation\nin Prince's Gardens; design work on this\nappears to be slowly material ising. This scheme shows a high degree of\nclear thinking in the modern idiom, and\nmust be treated as a whole; the architects\nRichard Sheppard and Partners are to be\ncongratulated on the revolutionary lines\nLORD MAYOR'S SHOW\nstem os PA\u2014 s they have followed. The three sides of the\nSquare that are going to be developed are\neach treated in a similar manner. With a scheme in wh i oh each building will be housing anything up to400 students, something\nmust obviously be done to out down the in terminable problem of corridors and this\nhas been brilliantly solved by designing\nthe building round that most English of\narchitectural features, the staircase.\nThe easiest way of understanding Shopparda idea is to study the building floor\nby floor. The ground floor will o on tain such things as refectories and other\ncommunal facilities; the actual allocation\nof facilities does not seem to be finally decided. The first floor contains common\nrooms wh i oh serve the residents who have\nstudy-bedrooms on the second, third and\nfourth floors; in addition wardens' flats are included on this floor. The fifth floor\nis a repeat of the first, while the sixth,\nseventh, eighth and ninth are repeats of\nthe lower block of three floors of study-bedrooms.\nBy this means one has obtained essentially two separate Halls of Residence, one\non top of the other. The crux of the whole\nBatter is in the way each of those sets of\nthree floors have been designed.\nOn entering the ground floor the student\ngoes up to the first or fifth floor by lift; he then passes along the common room gallery\nuntil he oc mes to his own particular stair case, he ascends this until he arrives at\nhis own particular floor. It sea a a that\nabout eight rooms are arranged round east\nlanding together with oo aau nal bathroom\nand toilet accommodation. By this mrt in naclo e er unity ought to be obtained than\nwith the conventional type of n \u00bbn of\nResidence. In each study-bedroom a long\nwindow\u2014seat i a planned, a floor area of\n140 square feet is believed to be that\nused, and a wash basin i a also included.\nThe architects' sketch views of the elevations and fs neat ration a are distinctly interesting, and it i a to be hoped that\nthey do not fall down in the actual\ncladding of the structure.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX GUILDS CLEAN UP\nAFTER LORD MAYOR\nOH WHY AEE WE ?\nFor the tenth time, the Film Society\nhas emerged from a six month period of\nhibernation and bankruptcy. How, granted a new lease of life by the Union Treasurer,\nit faces yet another season of breakdowns,\ncancellations and half filled auditoria.\nOne may wonder why the Film Society\nexists at all. Founded in1948, audiences\nin the early years reached astronomical\nfigures - in the region of 200-300 - and\noften shows were held twice nightly. However, since those propitious days, the\nSociety has reo ei veda number of setbacks.\nFirst, the advent in1951 of the National Film Theatre sounded the death-knell\nof the Society, a blow from which logic-ally It should never have recovered\nNO PROJECTOR In the second place, the Society does\nnot possess its own projector. It therefore borrows one from the College Authori ties, and must hire a projectionist appointed by them. Financial considerations\napart, this means that the Society has no\ncontrol over the quality of projection.\nOlder members may remember an evening when\nthe projectionist gave a capable demonstration of almost every technical fault\nthat can possibly occur. His efforts were\nnot appreciated.\nThirdly, the Society has been hounded\nround the College, from one unsuitable\nhall to another. Perhaps the most notorious\nwas the main Chemistry Lecture Theatre in the E.C. S. In order to increase the volume\nof sound, the loudspeaker was placed in front of the microphone of the public address system. The result was that those\nwho sat at the front could hear the loudspeaker perfectly but were too o lose to\nths screen. Those at the back of the theatre had an excellent view of the sore en, but could only hear a loud booming sound\nand the whirr of the projector. The smart\nHeader will now ask \"Why not s it in the\nmiddle?\" But here the audience was so distracted by the antics of those at the front\nwho could not see, and those at the back\nwho could not hear, that they never sat\nthere twice.\nPSST\nThe final blow came when the film distributors banned the selling of tickets at\nthe door. Tickets must therefore be sold\nIn the Union. There were speculations on\nthe meaning of the phrase \"at the door?\nWithin what distance of the door was one\nnot actually at it?20 ft...30 ft...300\nyd s... \u00a7 a mile? One could imagine furtive\nticket vendors, lurking in the shadow of\nthe Boderlc Hill Building.\nThe attendances at the first two s hews this season suggest that this period of\nhardship has been only temporary. A major\nreason for ths change of fortune must be\nthe luxury of the new Chem. Eng. Lecture\nTheatre in which our shows are now held.\nThose who have experienced the comfort of\nthis hall of culture have enjoyed it. Why\nnot you?\nThe formation of a University Jazz Band\nis always a difficult matter: keeping one\ntogether is even more difficult. Last year\nthere was a fairly successful jazz band in the college but at the beginning of this\nterm it was found that two of the most important members of the band were missing,\nthe trumpet and clarinet players, so that\nany new band formed would have to start\nvirtually from the beginning , building\nup a repertoire of numbers and rehearsing\nthem into a playable condition.\nFreshers' Day brought a list of about\nthirty musicians interested in playing\njazz and from these we managed to obtain musicians experienced enough to fill the vacancies in the old band. The new\nband is very similar in style to last\nyears and may be described as \"traditional1' with leanings towards Chicago style, but\nemploys a somewhat unusual front line of\nfour - two clarinets, trumpet s nd trombone,\nleading four rhythm. It is felt that the\naddition of an extra clarinet produces a fuller tone than is normally produced with\nthe standard three front line. The band\nhas played at Saturday hops in the college\nand is going to play at Guilds' Carnival\nand at the Jazz Club hop on November 2 3 rd. There also exists in the college a \"New Orleans\" style band which is having\nsome difficulty in obtaining musicians,\nand a skiffle group which played at Harlington on Nov. 5th. It is also intended\nto form a quartet playing a more modem\nstyle in jazz; such a group would be the\nfirst one of its kind in the college.\nOnce again the band is going to play on\nSunday afternoons in the Nucleus Coffee\nBar, 9 Monmouth St. The Nucleus is a favourite haunt of Jazz musicians, and membership of the club entitles one to attend\nall-night jam sessions on Saturdays, The\nband also hopes to play at the Nucleus\nduring the Christmas vacation.\nFQB_\u00a7AJE.\nA complete set of l st. year Guild's Course work (including fully-solved\ntutorial sheets) - Very cheap.\nApply Box 37.\nThis year Guilds were again represented\nin the Lord Mayor's Show, having been invited to man some of the Floats and to provide bodies for other tasks. 27 Guildsmen assembled in Sun St. Barracks,near\nMoorgate, to change into costumes of many\nshades and styles,and to regale themselves\nin a tire suitable to the windy, but not\ntoo odd weather. The efforts of the two\nheralds to obtain pleasing tones from\ntheir bugles met with a mixed reception,\nespecially from the W. R.A.F. band who\nwere standing immediately behind the. principal Guilds float awaiting the start of\nthe procession.\nOnce the procession moved off the cold\nwas forgotten amidst the shouts and laughter of the crowds - much provoked by the\nstill un practised efforts of the heralds,\nThe rear of the procession was brought\nup by those redoubtable Guildsmen Mike\nGorb, Syd Lenssen and Jon Blok in charge\nof the the traditional dust o arts^ That\nthey were thoroughly enjoying themselves\nwas evident from the laughter of the\ncrowd and the bruises on the nether of\nGorb, who was hurled from a hand dust\ncart in front of the Mansion House by an\nover eager Blok. The even earned their\nkeep by'sweeping up Arundel Street after\nthe many horses had passed on their way.\nThe usual reception was enjoyed as the\nAdvertising float passed the Spanner, Davs\nStevens and Guilds down Ludgate Hill, in the shape of a Booraalaka, with drummers\ndrumming. Heralds bugling and Postmen shouting in chorus.\nA most excellent lunch was had by the\nparticipants when they arrived back at Sun\nSt. John Hobson silenced the London School\nof Printers and King's who were also\nsomewhere in the show - with quite a witty\nspeech of thanks to the organisers, calculated to justify Guilds and confound the\n\"others\" in the eyes of those present.\nThere followed a most energetic and heart-quailing Boomalaka in traditional Guilds\nstyle, led by Tice President John Sheldon.\nIt can fairly be said that Guilds have\nmade their mark on yet another Lord Mayor's Show, and, by their enthusiasm and wit,\nprovided the crowd with quite a spectacle\nnot least the walking figures and commas,\nwho confessed to being somewhat troubled\nby their loads and the wind, but otherwise\nprovided their own spontaneous show. The\nwhole affair was most enjoyable, and\nGuilds are looking forward to next year\nand another show.\nGUILDS' EYE VIEW\nCLUB REVIEW/\n\n"

(Unfortunately\nthe Cun was \" lost\" some years a eo and we\nwere not able to bring it back with us.)\nOf the seven contests , I.C. were represented in five and won three.\nIn the first contest of the evening,\nKim lani, al thorn* lacking experience, beat\nan obviously unfit opponent on points in no uncertain style. In tbe next bout Ycrke\ngave an impressive display to win against\na boxer who had the advantage in size, and\nis to be congratulated on his skill and\ntoughness; the referee stopped the fight in the third round to prevent what would\nprobably have been a K.O. Gordon Halsey, I.C. Captain, fighting the man whom he beat in the trials last year\nmade good use of his greater reach to hold\noff a very determined opponent, and won on\npoints, in the best contest of the evening.\nA fresher at I.C. Jim Pi at t, boxing as\nal irt it heavy, gave a very good performance\nand seemed certain of winning, when in the\nthird round he caught a wild right swing on\nthe jaw which nearly K.O. 'ed him, and the\nreferee stopped the contest a few seconds\nlater to prevent his opponent finishing off\nthe job. With more experience in the art\nof defence he should uphold the honour of\nI.C. well in the future.\nRUGBY Isr ROUND CUP WIN\nI.C. OVERWHELM VETS IN U.L. CUP MATCH\nI.C.. Vets.\n.20\n..3\nI.C. soundly beat the Royal Veterinary College in the first round of the\nU.L. Cup, due mainly to the courage and\nfitness of the forwards.\nThe first half was closely fought,\nwith honours just going to the Vets.,\nwho managed to convert a penalty just\nbefore half-time to make the score 3-0\nat the interval. Right from the start\nof the second half the I.C. forwards put\non a great display and began to get the\nbetter of the Vets. pack. The ball was\ntaken into the Vetsl half when a penalty\nwas awarded to I.C. for a loose scrum\ninfringement. Fly-half Hearn converted\nto make the score 3-3. This put heart\nInto the I.C. team, and five minutes\nlater another long-range and finely angled penalty by Hearn put I.C.63 up.\nThe I.C. pack was now really on top and\nplay took place mainly in the Vets!\nhalf i with their attacks being broken up\nby good covering.\nTbe I.C. forwards now took the ball at their feet and dribbled over the VetsI\nline where Gilbert beat a Tats, man to\nthe touch-down with a splendid dive. The\ntry was not converted and the score waa\nnow 9-3. Hearn then added a further 6\npoints to the I.C. score with a drop goal\nand another penalty, both good kicks. The\nfinal score for I.C. earns from a three-quarter movement starting on the I.C.25, the threes sweeping through the opposition and sending winger Gibson over for a try which Hearn converted.\nThe date of the second round of the\nCup will shortly be announced and the Rugger Club will be running supporters'\ncoaches \u2014 so come along and support I.C. The team:\nPeart, Smith, Berrynan, Phillips, Gibson,\nHearn, Lens, Wronaki, Riley, Evans,\nBurns, Crosier, Wright, Gilbert, Parker.\nMike Clarke, that bearded veteran of\nI.e. boxing, provided much material for\nthe wits in the audience, but was unable\nto overcome his opponent and lost on points.\nIt was good to see a large crowd of\nI.0. men watching the contests and lending\nvociferous aid to the participants;\nperhaps some of them would like to come\nalong on Friday nights at 5-30 pm. to the\ngym, where the boxing club holds its training sessions, and we are always ready\nto welcome new members, with or without\nprevious experience.\nFootnote: The Sennet report was incorrect\nin crediting I.e. with 4 wins; the error\nwas due to a mistake in the programme.\n\"Si,\nHOCKEY\nWED.

This was particularly evident when\nI.0. lost 1 - 3 to a strong Corinthian\nCasuals side. I.C. had most of the play\nparticularly in the second half when Casuals were reduced to 10 men, but wasted\nchances lead to our heaviest defeat of\nthe season.\nIn the other two matches played since\nthe last issue I.C. reo or ded two wins,\n2 - 1 against Wimbledon 'A' and 5 - t against Q..M.

As before, the\ndefeat was due to the close packing of the\nKings' men but the individual winner was\nJ. Conway of IC. who had the incentive of being the official so ore rl However, the 9 th. of November was a much\nmore encouraging day, as IC. produced two\nfull teams for the first time this season.\nThe second t3am, including some \" old lags\"\nturning out for the first time,did well to beat Goldsmiths'easily over a difficult5 mile course. The first team,which was not\nnearly as strong as it should have been,\ncompeted in a major fixture in Loughborough.\nThe team result was disappointing, as IC\nwas not only beaten by superior opposition\nfrom Manchester, Birmingham and Loughboro',\nbut also by LSE. and UC. Nevertheless,\nsome of the individual performances were\npraiseworthy. John Collins was sixth in a field including some of the best runners\nin UAU. J. Conway was 11 In gaining a place\nin the UL. first team, and AL. Brown, 28th., was awarded a well-deserved place in the\nUL. second team.\nOn Wednesday 12th., IC. were shamefully\ndefeated by QMC. a result due solely to the\npoor club turn-out of members who would\notherwise have gained places in the middle\nof the field. As usual we provided the\nfirst man home due to a magnificent effort\nby John Collins,who completely left the rest\nof the field, achieving the still rare time\nof under 29 minutes.\nIt is{ ratifying to see the consistently\nkeen support of the lower second team members who are turning out for all fixtures.\nFinally, over the notorious cu ur seat Parliament Hill Fields on November 16, the\nsecond team gave one of its best performances to finish Second to Guy's Hospital,\nbut defeating UC. ,Bcrcugh Road, and\nInstitute of Education. J. Jaeger, fit at last was Jrd., and other IC positions were\n8 th.,12 th., it th.,14 th., and 1 8 th., showing that even IC can practise packing.\nThe UL. Championships into w hio his incorporated the annual battle between RCS,\nMines and Guilds, takes place on December7.\nThis event has always been characterised\nby a large entry from 10., including\ncompetitors running for their constituent\noo lle ges, who do not normally compete.\nWe again invite these\"oas u als \"to turn out\n(no previous experience required)\nSports Editorial Felix congratulates the Rugby and\nHookey dubs on their recent first round Cup successes.\nThe Tab la-Tennis Club appears to be conducting its affairs in secrecy: we have\nhad no match reports at all fro a them.\nFELIX welcomes the news that an L>C Billiards and Snooker Club Is being\nformed. Anyone who is interested in joining this Club should contact M.A. Webb.\nThere la certainly a need for some\ncontrol over the Billiard Room, judging\nfrom reports of \"block bookings\" and\nof extremely bad behaviour in the\nBilliard Room.

Colour Group\nCIRCUIT TRAINING\nFor the past few years, Circuit Training - a new form of progressive training\nfor physical fitness - has been arousing\nInterest in this country and overseas. Ths\npossession of a healthy body is a prime\nnecessity in this modem age if we are not\nto break down under the strain of living, and this is especially true in the case of\nthe hard-working student. The ideal:\n\u2022Mens sana in o or pore sano' is too often\nforgotten. Circuit Training (C.T.) meets\nthis need in the ph y sio al education of\nstudents, and was in fact evolved in the\ngym of the University of Leeds.\nIt is a medical fact that the best way\nof developing a healthy muscle is to exercise against an ever-increasing resistance,\nand there is no better way of dJ Jing this\nthan weight training, increasing the number\nof repetitions performed, or steadily\nincreasing the pound age used. The bar bell system is ideal, since the weight can be\neasily adjusted by as little as -J lb. at a time.\nWeight training is now used as aba sio training for all p ports. Examples of\nsportsmen who claim that their suo ces s13 largely due to regular doses of \"iron\npills* can be found everywhere. Famous\nathletes include Chris Brasher, Gordon\nPi tie, Brian Shenton, John Savidge,\nPharoah, Ian Anthony, Emil Zatopeck, etc.\nThe athlete who does not use weights is the\nunusual type. Swimmers like Mike Breckneil\ntrain regularly with weights, as do C3r\nc lists Reg. Harris Dave Bedwell, Cyril Peacock.\nMany first division Soccer teams include\nweights in their training schedules...\nRugger.. Rowing..Need we continue ? For\nthe benefit of the IC Musical Soc. Guy Mitc hell is a regular weight trainer as well.\nWeight training is used as a mean3 of\nph y sio al culture ( body-building techniques\nused to build the physique to the best size\nand strength) as a sport in its own right\n(weight lifting} and is also extensively-used as a remedial treatment (rehab il it at ion). The improvements possible are very\nrapid and have to be seen to be believed.\n(Not usually quite as quickly as Ch-rl-s Atl-s promises, though!) The fourth use\nof barbells is the comparatively recent one\nof C.T. At present the circuit is open in the\nSnack Bar every evening at 5.00pm. or 5.30\non Tuesdays and Thursdays. If you are\ninterested, please come down one evening\nand have a look at the o irc u it. Enquiries\nfrom beginners and unfit men ( and women)\nespecially we loom e. It would be\nappreciated if non-sportsmen would use the\nWednesday training period so that overcrowding is avoided.\nThe main purpose of this article was\nhowever to draw the attention of non-sports-men to the value of circuit training for\nreaching and maintaining a reasonable\nstandard of physical strength and endurance.\nNo skill is required and the exercises are\ngraded to suit all types. Another advantage is that the circuit can be completed\nin less than half-an-hour.\nThe IC. circuit consists of n_.e simple\nexercises wh i oh are laid out round the room\nThe training rate, ie. the number of repetitions carried out on each exercise, is taken as one third of the maximum rate for\neach exercise, w hio his the number of repetitions which can be performed in one minute.\nWhen training one passes from one exercise\nquickly to the next in an anti-clockwise\ndirection until three laps of the circuit\nhave been completed.\nGOLF1 VICTORY OVER U.C.I. C. overwhelmed U.C. recently,\nwinning by 10 matches to 2. In the top\nfoursome, Mills and Wallace won comfortably\nbut Constable and Scriven were much too\ncasual and on Lv won on the last c reen,a result which did not truly ref leo t their\nsuperiority. Anderson and Parkinson,\nhowever, gave nothing away, winning well out\nin the country, while Butters and Oxley made\nit40. The procession continued in the after-noon. Mills, demonstrating the golf that\nhas established him as the University's top\nplayer, won easily, and Wallace, turning\n5 up, met a determined counter-attack b vat weathered the storm and eventually won by 3\nand 2. Constable, in determined mood,\nthrashed his opponent and the captain,\nParkinson, won easily, as did Anderson and\nScriven,\nButters, however, encountered\nstiff opposition and went down by 4 and 3\nin the face of some excellent i rolf. Oxley\nalso lost, to give U.C. their only other\nwin.\nSWIMMING\nI.C. had mixed fortunes in the\nmatch against Battersea. An early\nsuccess was gained in the only swimming\nevent, the medley relay, where steady\nperformances by Harford, Hills, Loveman,\nand Beckett trained a comfortable victory.\nThe l st. polo team were apparently not\ninspired by this, and did not settle down\na ea insta hard-tackling side. An early\nroa X for Battersea unsettled I.C. and\ndespite having a goal disallowed, the side\nnever quite had the measure of their\nopponents. Battersea scored as the ref.\nwas blowing for half time and full time,\nand the final score was 7-4.\nThe 2nd. team rained a resounding\nvictory, winning 8-1. Beckett a cored3 quick eo als and the team then scored at\nregular intervals. Beckett eventually\nscored 5, Harford 2, and a long-haired\nindividual (i.e. the skipper) 1.\nProspects for the league look br lah t for the 2nd, team, but the l st. team will have to improve their play a little.
