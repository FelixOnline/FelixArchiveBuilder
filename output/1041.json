The livelihood\nof the local population, mostly subsidence farmers and fishermen, has been directly affected.\nIn return they have received little compensation from a government which receives vast sums\nin oil revenue.\nFrustration has led many to protest. In response, the Nigerian government has conducted\na major military clamp down in the region and stands accused of widespread human rights\nabuse. Last weekends executions are just the latest incident in a long-running campaign of\nsuppression.\nIf you would like to find out more, please come along to the SCR in the Union Building\nat 1pm, on Wednesday 23rd November.\nLebanese Society\nPresents The Lebanese Party 1995.

    "content": "In the 1960s, people were becoming worried that their thoughts,\nbehaviour and actions could be\nmanipulated by messages.\nMessages that the conscious mind was\nnot able to perceive. Their main concern lay in the commercial field of\nadvertising, where it was felt that the\ntechnology existed for advertisers to\ncontrol the thoughts of television viewers un detect ably by inserting very short\nmessages onto the screen. These visual\n'subliminal messages' were flashed at a speed, brightness and size that would\ngo 'undetected' by the audience at a conscious level. According to leading\nprofessional bodies, this kind of stimuli\nis capable of influencing our emotions.\npart said that they had experienced a positive\n'feel good' factor as a direct result of the game.\nA spokesman for Time Warner stated that\nEndorfun may have drug like qualities, but at\nleast it's legal! Under the\n1990 Broadcasting Act,\nboth television and radio\nare prohibited to use subliminal messages that may\n\"influence the minds of\npersons...without them\nbeing fully aware of what\nhas occurred.\" Computer\ngames however, are not\nrestricted by this legis la tion.\nCurrendy, the British Film Institute (BFI)\nhave taken it upon themselves to c any out\nThe word 'sex' is formed in a dust cloud\nin a scene in 'The Lion King'\nhowever, have admitted to putting subliminal\ncuts of sexually explicit material into their films.\nOne recent release, \"Jade\" is said to contain\nsuch images. Its director,\nMichael Friedkin, was\nalso accused of using subliminal cuts in his earlier\nfilm, \"The Exorcist'. In a recent article in the LA Times, Gene Reynolds,\nthe President of the\nDirector's Guild of\nAmerica, noted that\nthere are no Guild rules\nabout the inclusion of\nsubliminal messages in films. \"We certainly don't have a policy against it, it's up to the individual\n\"Video Game Trance Danger!\nexclaimed the recent newspaper head\nlines as the new computer game,\nEndorfun, was released. Aimed at kids\nas young as 11, the game induces a i 'feel good' sensation into the player J through the use of subliminal mes\nsages. Almost 100 of these mess ag are concealed within the game's soundtrack, m esme rising the child\ninto a trance-like state. However,\nphrases such as \"I am the master\nof my life\", \"I am divinely gui d ed\" and \"I don't have to try and\nplease anyone else\" have pro- pv oke d outrage amongst parents\nwho condemned the game and\nits producer Time Warner, the\nlargest media corporation in\nthe world. The company\nopenly admits that, \"The\ngameplay is so addictive and so\ni mmer sive, that continued play\nis guaranteed.\" Andrea\nSimpson, a spokesperson for\nthe American giant, remarked\nthat the subliminal messages are\njust a \"hook on the g; marketing guys have done a very\ngood job!\" A recent live TV test\nof Endorfun demonstrated that ,.\nthe game did have an in\nenc ing effect on the players\nOne young girl claimed, A\"[ I] wanted to carry on\nplaying the game.\" All\nthe children who took\nmm\nresearch into the effects of subliminal messages\nw following an influx of inquiries from a con-Ik ce med public. \"Very, very little research has\njj jj been done in the UK.

He stated that space was tight already\nfor the rowing club's hundred\nregular members, with 'the various squads having to work on a rota system to ensure that they\nall got adequate training. The\ncurrent arrangements, especially\nfor women members, were 'far\nfrom ideal', changing areas having to double as gyms for fitness\nwork.\nMr Mason felt that issues\nThe model of the enlarged Boathouse. Residents were concerned over the increasingly detrimental\nenvironmental effect the Putney Reach Rowing Clubs are having.\nraised and dealt with long ago in\nthe consultation process had\nbeen dragged up needlessly,\nslowing the process at the planning permission stage. He also\nfelt that if the residents 'came\nand observed what [the Boat\nClub] do, they might be more\nforgiving', especially given the\nsuccess of the rowing teams so\nfar.\nThe expansion was scheduled to be finished for the start\nof the next academic year, in\ntime for the new season and a new intake of rowers, but any\nPHOTO: ANDREW PUTfER\ndelay will mean that new facilities will not be available when\nneeded.\nMr Caldwell added that he\nstill thought that IC's scheme\nwas workable, and that the\nCollege would lodge an appeal\nagainst the ruling.\nNews in brief\nBY ALEX FEAKES AND RACHEL WALTERS\nRug Thieves still at\nLarge\nEmbarassed Union Officials were\ncalled on to explain how Imperial\nCollege Union's front-doormat\ndisappeared from under their\nnoses on Wednesday night.\nThe mat went missing\nmoments after midnight, when\nUnion stewards were in the\nthroes of clearing the bar of the\nmidweek sports crowd.\nDa Vinci's had been full of\nsportspeople drinking after their\nBUSA sports matches against\nRoyal Holloway College, many\nclubs inviting their opponents\nback to the Union. Video footage\nfrom security cameras and gate\nstewards confirm that a huddle\nof Royal Holloway sportsmen left\nBeit Quad, carrying one of their\ndrunken compatriots in a bundle,\nat four minutes past twelve. The\nfilm clearly shows that both\nSarah White (ICU President)\nand at least two union stewards\nwere present at the time.\nSarah said that shortly after\nthe Royal Holloway team had\nleft, concerned students alerted\nher the absence of the doormat.\nHowever, the stewards on the\nexit said that they did not\nremember any large item of floor\ncovering walking out of its own\naccord, or being assisted by any\nperson.\nMiss White was angry with\nthe villains, saying that she 'found\nit hard to believe that anyone\nwould want to take such a smelly\nand dirty piece of foot mat.'

It is a place where some of life's losers seem to have\ncongregated: Victor (Pruitt Taylor Vince)Dolly's son who still lives with his mother and\ncooks her an elaborate fried breakfast every\nmorning, Delores (Deborah Harry) the waitress\nwho tends to offer Victor more than just the customers orders, and Leo - who spends each\nevening at the bar side. Into this steps Callie (Liv\nTyler) a pretty college drop-out who becomes\nthe new waitress. Victor is so smitten with\nCallie, though unable to overcome his intense\nem baras s ment whenever she pays him any\nattention all he can do is watch her leave work\nevery night with her boyfriend (Evan Dando).\nAs the film progresses, Dolly dies and we\nsee Victor trying to come to terms with having\nto take control of his own life without his moth-er. Despite all this Victor continues to fantasize\nabout Callie.\nThe director James Mangold wanted to\nmake a moving, quiet film, minimizing the\nwords and making those that are spoken inarticulate. This makes it hard for the viewer to maintain concentration as there is nothing to renew\nthe interest - should you lose it.\nThe film doesn't feature anything sign if i cant, just Victor moving from 'a state of possibility to a state of intense possibility'. Victor's problem with communicating with any woman at\neven the most basic level makes you feel at times\nembarrassed for him.\nHaving said this, the film has been highly\npraised at this year's Cannes Film Festival and\nalso features in the London Film Festival. Liv\nTyler received considerable acclaim for her part\nas Callie, but how hard can it be for a17 year old\ngirl to act the part of a17 year old girl? Along\nthose lines, who ever told Evan Dando that he\ncan act? Too many singers (Deborah Harry, Evan\nDando included) seem to think they can act as\nwell as sing, often with disastrous results. Dando\njust acts moody and strums his guitar so the role\nwas hardly taxing.\nThe director wanted to tell a story about the\npeople he grew up with, loved and admired, it is\na pity he didn't live somewhere more interesting.\nfilm: unzipped e Arriving late, as one should, I arrived in the middle of the adverts. Some designer or other -\"Isaac Mizrahi's Summer collection is now avail-able\". Oh joy.\nIt goes on. Waifs on cat walks, stubbly\nblok es on New York balconies; the usual stuff\nThe designer wanders around, goes into\nnewsagents, reads his own reviews. Gets\nDepressed Eh? 1 Iardly kicking sales techniques.\nThis is because it is not some post modem\nadvert, it is the film.\nFlicking between close-ups of Isaac's bantering mug, strutting models, someone's gran and\nsome fairly daft clothes, the picture loosely tells\nthe tale of the creation of a collection from inspiration to flirtation. Filmed in Mack and white,\nthe film occasionally jumps to a colour shot to\nbring out the true lunacy of the diS$p \u00a3.\nPerhaps this is a little unfair. The adventurous style does somehow work, and brings you to\na friendly closeness to Isaac and his work. In\nsummary, it is not a bad film, but the pre ten cio us effeminate characters are expressed too\nstrongly to meet widespread appeal.\nfilm: mute witness^ yA really enjoyable, though slightly silly\naction/murder thriller, but without Hollywood's incessant explosions and typecast heroes and bad\nguys. A woos ie american director is shooting a murder film in the Moscow sUi dios, when he,\nhis wife and their mute special effects helper, get\nembroiled in a real murder mystery. Enter\npolicemen, KGB agents, sub plot and twist after\ntwist in the story. It has comic moments, but also\nhas enough emotional scenes to suspend the dis-belief.\nThis is one of the few festival films I have\nseen that has prompted audience applause during the production, with plenty of laughs too.\nAnthony Waller's premiere, he handles the audience brilliantly, the tension is raised with inventive turns, then released in an amusing or make-|||pt lj ui ip?v l if:! Chcheed as it might sound, you\nnever know what's going to happen next.\nThis film is going to be very popular, and\nwhat's more, it's British.\n\n"

Oh\nwell, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. Not unless you keep trying and give\nit a swift boot up the rear end, that is.\nAnd so this week to those loveable thrash-ers, Anthrax. Let's clarify a few idling s at the out-set. They don't bite the heads off chickens. They\ndon't think they're hard. They have never have\nspouted misogynistic nonsense. They sung about\nthe plight of American Indians before Rage\nAgainst the Machine had reached acne age. They\nwrote the theme song to 'Judge Dredd' in 1987.\nThey were one of the first metal acts to delve into\nrap territory, culminating with the ultimate amalgam of cross-genre superpowers in the 'Bring the\nNoise' single with Public Enemy. In other words,\nthey're what you'd call innovators, avant-garde,\nthe sort of people who put the carrots in front of\nthe donkeys and then watch them try to catch up.\n'Stomp 442' is Anthrax's seventh album but\nsounds as charged and powerful as the car engine\nthat it's named after. Opener, 'Random Acts of\nSenseless Violence', not only has a delectable song\ntitle, but is a perfect melange of apocalyptic\nimages with its morse code guitar intro, air raid\nsirens and scything riffs. Indeed, as the album pro-cee ds, the listener is led through a myriad of emo-t ions, each song serving as a postcard of fear and\nviolence. The aptly named 'Riding Shotgun' is a galloping bronco of a song while 'In a Zone' takes\nyou to a great height and then drops you in one\nfell swoop with its gargantuan, descending chorus.\nThe album closes with 'Bare', a plaintive and\ndownbeat musical discourse, replete with bongos\nand bowed guitars. This is the necessary calm\nafter the storm and reminds you that this is one\nmetal band who don't just bang their heads\nagainst a wall every day. The last line John Bush\ncroons is, \"But mostly I wonder why\". And I 'll\nleave you to wonder why I couldn'tih ink of a decent way to finish off this review. (8)\nalbum: saint etienne too young to die,^ When I first heard St. Etienne, my heart\nfluttered and my head went into the\nclouds. I was in lu rr ve( not that I fancied\nSarah Cracknell, you understand).\nAvenue' had just come out and I wrote\na rave review for it in these pages (that\nwas '92).\nToday I'ms light iy disappointed. It's not that their blend of techno-pop has\ndated. It's just that like, say, The\nCarpenters, their music cannot be taken\nin big doses - it has to be rationed. And\nthis causes me pain. I want to be on a permanent a cken a line high from singles\nlike 'You're in a bad way', 'Who do you\nthink are?' and 'Hug my soul'.\nThrowaway kitsch, of course, and therefore repeated listens in a short space of time tend\nto be, well, disappointing. Maybe it's asking too\nmuch. Maybe I should turn to some serious drugs\ninstead.\nAnyway, this album has all the Saint Etienne\nsingles. As well as those mentioned above, there's 'Join our club', 'Hobart Paving', 'Pale Movie', etc.\nIt also has the rather good new single, 'He's on the\nphone'. The only blot on the landscape is 'I was\nbom on Christmas Day'.\nSaint Etienne are the em lxi di ment of cool,\nwhere style is of paramount importance and\nwhere substance is not sacrificed either. They are\nboth exciting and refreshing and, on an aesthetic\nlevel, intriguing. You should know by know if you\nwant to buy this album...(9)\n\n"

    "content": "LETTERS FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 1 7TH1995. TWENTY-THREE\nLETTERS TOFELIX: REPLIED TO THIS WEEK BY MARK BAKER Small animals bite tack To the Editor,\nThe author of the piece\n\"Why I love killing small animals\"\nmight have adopted a deliberately hackle raising (\"numbskull\")\nstyle, but the issue is an emotive\none and such articles do little to\nharbour useful dialogue between\ncamps or to get people thinking\nat all. Comments about hunt\nsaboteurs were bigoted and simply rude; This was crass writing.\nThe point underlying the\narticle, however, deserves a response. The environment, and\nthe resources within it, represent\nboth local livelihoods and a national resource which, increasingly threatened, has to be properly managed. Such management\nmay necessitate culling particular\npopulations and controlling pest\nspecies. Bloodsports are rarely, if\nat all, part of responsible management of the countryside; and all\ntoo easily the latter is used to justify the former. Moreover, animals cannot be considered as\nsimple material resources.\nAnimal welfare and the humane\ntreatment of animals are, I believe, important issues; don't treat animals with kid gloves -but recognise the needs of livestock and wild species and ensure\nsuffering (and environmental\ndamage] are minimise d. What is repellent about\nhunting is that it ignores these\nissues; the fox is hunted for the\npleasure of the hunt. (On the\nsubject of stress, prey species are\nalert to the threat of predation\nmuch of the time, but the author\nmisses the point that stress is an\nacute response; prey animals do\nnot habituate to the condition. It\nis easy to imagine running in terror from an attacker - it is a homologous response in the fox.\nA protracted chase by a pack of\ndogs and mounted huntsmen -possibly in exhaustion - might\nwell be considered unnecessary\nsuffering.) Presumably, it is the\nphysical challenge of the hunt\nthat is enjoyed, not the kill, but\nthat is just as near-sighted as eating plucked, gutted and packaged\nsupermarket chickens - there is\nno understanding of the natural\nhistory of the fox, or any care for\nit. I doubt if many members of a hunt have a close working contact with the countryside; a pro-portion, I am sure, live in towns.\nAs a form of pest control, blood-sports seem highly inefficient; let\nestate managers and farmers control pest populations.\nIt is not a matter of wanting\nas an it is ed countryside of \"fluffy\nanimals\" but of striving for a working knowledge of rural communities and ecology and a respect for animal life.\nDavid Wembridge\nSt. Mary's Hosp. Medical School\nDear Felix,\nWith regard to the feature in\nthe last issue \"Why I love killing\nsmall animals.\" I do not wish to\ncomment on whether or not\nblood sports are morally or\nsocially defensible but rather on\nthe tone in which the article was\nphrased.\nNearly every paragraph contains an attack on the personalities of these stereotypical hunt\nsaboteurs which has no bearing\non the actual argument which the\nwriter purposes to discuss.\nIt is unfortunate that any\nvaguely political argument in the\npages of this newspaper or on the\nwider national scale is reduced to\na person jibe at the opposition.\nGreater attention to the actual\nissues under discussion would\nlead to a more fruitful debate and\ndescribing one's opponents as\nbeing \"unwashed\", \"Greenham\nCommon descendants\", \"yo bs\", \"bent-double dirty faced and all\nfacial appendages pierced\" is a petty-minded and pathetic\nrecourse for those who do not\nhave the ability to properly\ndefend their stance.\nI. Fraser Jenkins\nPhysics 4\nI'm very happy to say that I agree entirely with these, two letters - I'm rather surprised we\nhaven't received more replies of\noutrage concerning the article.\nWould anyone care to redress\nthe balance with an anti-hunt\nview?\nIndeed, if anyone would like\nto write a feature on any issue of\nthis nature then please come in!\nWe want to hear from you...\nNooman Says: My article\nwas clearly an exaggerated and\nseditious support of blood-sports. Mr. Wembridge is correct\nin assuming that it was hackle\nraising and I praise him for\nnoticing that there were some\nreal points in there. My aim was\nto show that it helps neither side\ninvolved in such issues to bury\nany sensible points they may\nhave under a mountain of abuse.\nI was compelled to write after\nmy experiences at Brightlingsea\nearlier this year, where I intended to explore the issue of veal\nexports objectively, and met\ninstead a tirade of violent\nrhetoric directed not only at the\nlorry drivers but also their wives\nand children. The use of stereo-types, alarmist tones and personal attacks should not be condoned by anyone.\nSmoke witko u tire Dear Felix,\nPhysics Department Blackett\nPassive Smoking\nWith reference to your\n\"News Team\" on the above, the\nnotices on no smoking were up a week before, giving plenty of\ntime for comments. There are\ntwo items I would like to comment on: passive smoking and the\nstate of the floor. I would think it\nwould be a good idea to have a notice which reads: \"Please use\nthe ash-trays and bins provided.\"\nPassive smoking\nWe agree to \"Health\nDamage\", they are the reason\nwhy there is no smoking in cine-mas, in buses, planes, etc. Often\nfines would be implemented to\nenforce this.\nState of the floor\nWould you treat your home\nlike the floor of Blackett?\nI am not against smoking,\nbut it is time for the college to\nhave a proper policy and not just\nmonitor for the sake of it.\nPerhaps a policy to provide an\nindoor, well ventilated, room for\nsmokers. Let the smokers have\nthe responsibility of keeping it\nclean, not the cleaners, they have\nmore than enough work already.\nArchie W. Wallace\nElectrical Safety Technician\nPhysics Department\nDear Felix,\nWith reference to your front\npage article about the Physics\nsmoking ban, I must say say up\nfont that I am a non-smoker,\nalways have been, guess I always\nwill be. I, for one, am glad that\nthe foyer smoking area has\nceased to be, I could witter on\nabout the improvement to my\nbreathing etc. or regale you with\nstories of others who were in a similar plight, I could go on to\nmention the relief of the cleaning\nstaff at not having to clean up the\ndisgusting mess that would confront them each morning, not to\nmention the dangers of passive\nsmoking or the psychological\neffect it must have had on visitors to the department, who, at\ntimes, must have thought that\nthey were walking into a London\n\"peas ou per\". But we are all intelligent adults and know most, if\nnot all, of the reasons why the\nban was inevitable. However,\nthere is still the problem of the\nsmoking community who have\nbeen left out in the cold, so to\nspeak. I feel that if all parties\ninvolved got together, an answer\ncan be found that would respect\nthe wishes of both smokers and\nnon smokers in the department.\nS. Cleverly\nPhysics\n\n"

Yet tor some bizarre\nreason around a hundred Imperial\nstudents a year go to study there\nthrough the ERASMUS scheme.\nThey spend about nine months\nexploring the ins and outs of a foreign city, to which all intents and\npurposes could well be on another\nplanet. But don't panic or pull your\nhair out in frustration because you\ndon't know what to expect. Just ask\nsomeone who has been before (and\nread this of course).\nThe main countries involved are France,\nGermany, Italy and Spain and although each\nplace has its little quirks, there are generali-ties:\n\u2022 Beer in pubs and restaurants is expensive -a sad i act but one you will (soon) learn to\nlive with. A pint of beer is anything from\n\u00a33-4.\n\u2022 Beer (and alcohol in general) is extremely,\neven shockingly cheap in supermarkets.\nThis means at most parties it's actually\nfree. Look out for money-back on bottles\n- buying a crate is also much cheaper, and\naccommodation is cheaper than in London\n(OK, not exactly difficult to achieve).\n\u2022 Food is generally more expensive, but this\nis more than countered by the accommodation. \u2022 The vast majority of universities offer e mail, but beware of confusing foreign key-boards. You may have to ask the computing department, or pay a small fee - but it\nis there if you look and you can log into\nImperial - Y talk here you cornel\n\u2022 The libraries have English text books -don't bother wasting space (or weight\nallowance) by taking them with you.\n\u2022 It is worth taking your own lab coats,\nsafety glasses, specialist equipment - they\nmight expect you to pay for them.\n\u2022 It's much cheaper for people in England to\nphone Europe than vice versa. Get your\nloved ones (oo er) to install Mercuryyou'll save a fortune.\n\u2022 Student unions do not exist in the same\nmanner as here, it's far less centralised and\norganised - but 'parties' are arranged if\nyou look for them.\n\u2022 Halls of residence are not the social places\nthey are here - no friendly re-apps to\nshow you the ropes. Students live there\nfor 4/5 years so it's very clique y and you'll\nbe shocked how all the rooms are person-ali sed. \u2022 Other ERASMUS students of all nationalities are very friendly, so get to know\nthem - they're in the same boat as you\nare.\n\u2022 Take your birth certificate, driving license,\nImperial registration documents, passport\nphotos (lots of them), student loan documents (if you intend to apply for the first\ntime have your interview before you go),\nbank references and details of where your\nmoney is coming from i.e. grant cheques.\nEven a passport is useful!\n\u2022 Credit cards and Eurocheque cards are\nhandy; NatWest should offer a Eurocheque card free for a year. For\nFrance though 'Cirrus' is more useful.\n\u2022 European postal services are not to be\nrelied on. It takes approximately three\n(Germany) to five (France) days for letters to reach England or arrive in Europe\nand for a letter to reach Paris it needs a whole week. Yet in Italy it takes a staggering two weeks!\n\u2022 It's easier to talk to other foreigners - they\nspeak more slowly.\n\u2022 Take your own bedding - or live in a hos-pital.\n\u2022 Look out for the Irish Pub - they're everywhere and generally lively and a good\nlaugh. (Also they tend to speak English\nand you can get pints of Guinness!)\n\u2022 Look out for travel opportunities: special\noffers . on trains etc. For example,\nHannover to Berlin (takes 6 hours) for a mere \u00a31.50 - honest! In Italy a \"Carte\nVerde\" is very useful. Public transport is\nexcellent in general and though out Germany at least, cycling is safer.\n\u2022 The technical side of a foreign language\ncan be picked up very easily.\n\u2022 Take your own BluTac - it's unknown on\nthe continent (take a suitcase and make\nyour fortune!)\n\u2022 Language lessons are usually available and\ndefinitely worthwhile (even if only to\nmeet other foreign students). In France\nyou will probably be expected to pay for\nthese and then claim a proportion back.\n\u2022 Enquire about the climate before you go -thermal vests in Germany may be adv is able.\n\u2022 Registration is a long, painful process - ask,\nbeg, plead for help and save yourself\nweeks as your supervisor can jump the\nqueue.\n\u2022 Everyone asked said they'd definitely go\nagain.\nOK, so now you've packed your lab coat,\nthrown out your text book and installed\nMercury. Take a look at the individual co un tries...\nsO you\nvoc zx nf to\ns pen P yea\ndc\\2^51^ Sun, sand, sea and hot weather are on oiler\nin this country of hospitality. One festive\noccasion not to drag yourself away from is\n\"Fallan\" (mid March), unless of course it is to\ngo bullfighting. A constant supply of porn has\nalso been cited as an advantage (they know\nwho they are!) and an ISIC (International\nStudent Identity Card) is very useful. The\nuniversity canteens are cheap, but \"night\u00a7\nmare chaos\" rules in the queues. Everything:\nis generally cheaper there, in fact.\n\n"

It seems to emphasise the\napparent cori fi is ion surrounding the area to\nwhich we are going; at various stages the map is\nof Europe and the Mediterranean, then Africa,\nthen Asia, with our location each time appearing\nas a dot in the corner as it approaches Yemen.\nBe^\u00bb'to..pa Bk s \u00bbM\"Y^ s a a t|r| ie into land as every\nwoman on the plane begins to whip out heavy\nshawls and veiling'; Those who were already\n\u2022modestly covering their hair are transl on ned info amorphous black Dartir \\V| der style\ni creatures, and. even those who wer# flouncing\n:\naround in a fairly lil x 'rated lash ion color all their\n; bright clothes to leave only their faces showing.\nWe are leh with the rather intriguing sight of a long black shroud with a pair of three-inch white\nstill et to s peeping Oht from underneath, and af&i hy plastic, ..lind b^t fir b v v n over the bit I presume'l She^!

Perhaps more\nalarmingly, they all appear to have daggers\nhanging in a faint iy phallic fashion from then-belts. I am soon to discover that these provide a massive amount of conversation as status\nsymbols amongst the young men of Yemen. As\nthey laze around during the afternoons, ritual\nknife one-up-man-ship (dagger envy?) is very\ndefinitely the order of the day. \"Hey, have you\nseen the length\nof my blade?\nIt's got a three\ninch curved\ntip!\" \"Yeah, but\njust look at the\njewelled hilt on\nmine!\"\nThoughts of\n\"is it entirely\nwise to turn up\nin one of the\nlesser Gulf\nStates at 10 pm\nwith nowhere\nto stay?\" are\nswept away by the spectacle of the situation:\neveryone seems to know each other, and their\nfriendliness is quite remarkable. Someone has\nfound a thick, expensive looking wallet in\nimmigration, and the shouted exchanges across\nthe clatter of the baggage carousel try to establish\nwhose it is. The general consensus seems to be\nthat it is ours: clearly only a stupid Westerner\nwould lose such a thing. We have to enter into a fairly heated discussion before we are able to\npersuade the assembled crowd that we don't want it.\nSomehow, an hour later we find ourselves\nhappily c lr in king tea with Izat, the proprietor of\na400 year old converted palace, paying a rather\nless grand $4.50 to be put up for the night. He is\nalarmingly friendly, though perhaps not really\nwhat we had in mind for the typical Yemeni: we\nwant to talk about the local politics and about\nArab culture, he wants to discuss the Princess of\nWales. We ask to hear of the struggle amongst\nthe Saddam-led states, he wants to know about\nGeorge Michael's recording contract.\nThe whole experience is tempered by the\nhuge amounts of qat we are press uri sed to\nconsume. It seems Middle Eastern ways of\ngetting ones' kicks require rather more effort and\nendurance than we Westerners have come to\nexpect.

    "content": "theatre: angela hitler i babe magnet\nContemplating a play about the evil of the Hitler\nfamily, I could only worry about how approachable this piece would be. Its slow start of a mime\nto opera set the pace for the first forty minutes,\nwith an empathy for the characters taking a considerable time to build.\nWe were given the premise of a nephew of\nAdolf Hitler returning to investigate whether he\nwas really dead. In the process he discovers\nAngela Hitier (a cousin of Adolf) and her house-maid, testifying to a fictional Nurenburg Court.\nThrough a process of flashbacks he also jumps to\nconversations he had with Angela Hitler's daughter (Adolf's niece) many years ago.\nConfused?...I was for a while too. It is\nimportant to understand how someone could be\nas evil as Adolf Hitler, and this play exposes\nsome of the (true) things that happened; his own\nphysical abuse suffered during childhood and the\nsexual abuse and eventual murder he inflicted on\nhis niece. Amongst these disquieting facts we see\nthe still living bias of Angela Hitler - she remarks\nat one point to her nephew, \"your blood is not\npure, it is staining our tablecloths.\"\nThe play draws to an abrupt climax as\nAngela Hitler begins to believe that Adolf may\nactually have committed some of the acts he\nstands accused of.\nThis play said something noteworthy, but\ndespite some convincing performances, the ac\ntors could not hold together a fragmented plot\non an almost bare stage. I went away thinking\n'that was surprisingly unmemorable' - not the\nsort of intense drama I had expected it to be. At\n\u00a36.50 (if you get a student discount) I would\navoid this unless you really want to know the\nstory te hind Adolf Hitler's atrocities.\nsimon baker By the time you read this, the\nCommonwealth Conference will have finished.\nThis esteemed organisation, for which I have\nconsiderable respect, is not usually the source of\nhot news. Not this year it would seem, following\nthe French nuclear tests and more\nrecently, the executions in Nigeria,\na despicable act of an evil regime\nthat cannot go unpunished. To that\nend, there have right iy been calls\nfor Nigeria's expulsion and trade\nsanctions. I shall not repeat my\nviews on the French tests, but offer\na possible explanation of John\nMajor's singular support for our\nGallic cousins. As far as Ire mem ber, we were quite late in our\nresponse to the first test and certainly later than Germany. It is therefore possible\nthat by not condemning the French, John Major\nis hoping to curry favour with Jacques Chirac,\ndrive a wedge between France and Germany\nand reduce the prospect of monetary union and\ngreater federalism in Europe. Before the leadership election, I would never had thought that he\nwas capable of such a master stroke. Perhaps he\nstill isn't. But if I'm right he's a damn sight more\nclever than we give him credit for.\nAuckland is not the only place where the fur's been flying. Our poor friends in the physics\ndepartment have finally had their place of nicotine nirvana closed, the last inside an academic\ndepartment. Despite being a non-physicist (on\ngrounds of health risk) and only a passive 10 a day man, I am less distressed than some are\nundoubtedly are. Nevertheless, let me offer\nsome possible solutions. As I have said before,\nsmokers are more than welcome in the JCR.\nCome along and while away the day trying to\nstain those nasty little signs yellow to the point of\nillegibility. Better still, since the JCR is already\ncrowded, the College could free up,^* mm^ some more space in Sherfield for\nH the more productive activity of\n\u2022 these displaced students. The\n'Philip Morris Reading Room' has a nice ring to it.\nElsewhere, the Linstead bar debate\ncontinues, culminating in the attendance of a pro-Rector at a hall meet-ing. We read that he heard the case\nfor re-opening and acknowledged\nthe somewhat hasty action taken.\nHe goes on to say that 'he would\nhave preferred to close the bars of both Linstead\nand Southside'. Professor Swanson, a word of\nadvice: even at the most apathetic university in\nthe country, the closure of Southside bar for a matter of minutes would almost certainly result\nin an outbreak of war, with a barricade on Watts\nWay that is both vandal-proof and a bit better at\nhalting cars than its predecessor becoming nec-ess ary. When your humble columnist is not lovingly\nassembling words for your delight and d elect a tion, he likes to 'hang out' with the young pe o ple, dancing to tunes from the hit parade. To this\nend, I attended 'Club Alien' at The Rocket on\nFriday. A most excellent evening's entertainment\nwas provided. I cannot recommend it highly\nenough.\nbridge lane\nqueen carol\nriver dan c v*i; If ll ll1 jj Jlo\n:\n31\ntre\nIf Cld\n\n"

After\na fine John Evans try from some\nwell worked back-row play,\nEvans himself made the con ver sion, and from then on Imperial\nalways looked the better side.\nThe second half gave IC the\nwind advantage, which they used\nto good effect in pinning back a resurgent RHUL side. A further\ntry, this time from Fitz von\nEsser, finished the scoring,\nalthough the result would have\nbeen a great deal more impressive if it wasn't for IC's newest\nrecruit from the the Royal\nCollege of Music dropping the\nball whilst over the try line on\ntwo occasions (allegedly).\nA superb all round effort,\nfor which credit must go to IC's back row supremacy, and fine\ndefensive work in the backs. The\ngame was unfortunately abandoned with only minutes\nremaining due to the insatiable\ndesire of RHUL's team members\nto go joy riding in ambulances.\nLadies Continue\nWinning Run\nThe women's football team took\nan early lead through a long\nrange effort from Amber which\nproved too difficult for the goalkeeper to handle. Despite heavy\npressure from Holloway's girls,\nIC's american goalie Kendra's positioning was sound, and the\nscore remained unchanged at\nhalf-time. After the break the\nImperial side held it's shape\nwell, allowing Eva to score (only\none this week?)\nWith a \"particularly\nobnoxious\" coach urging RH on\nfrom the sidelines, IC let their\nconcentration slip, permitting\nRH's large striker through,\nputting themselves under great\npressure in the worsening conditions. IC's ladies held on though\nto record their fifth BUSA win,\ntaking a100% record through to\nthe second round.\nVirgins Deflowered\nAfter a somewhat lethargic start,\nthe Virgins found themselves\nten points behind a strong\nHolloway side. Stirred into\naction, the IC side fought back,\nand spent the remainder of the\nfirst half encamped in the opposition's half. This was continued\nin the second half, but sustained\nImperial pressure was not converted into points, thanks largely\nto committed defending from\nRH. A freak break minutes from\nthe final whistle saw Holloway\ntake the score to 17 - 0. By all\naccounts though, the lovely\nVirgins were very unlucky, and\nthe score line was a very poor\nreflection of their excellent\nefforts.\nICBC\nwin yet\nagain\nSaturday, the fifth of\nNovember, saw 462 crews of all\nabilities compete in the four and\na quarter mile Head of the River\nRace. It was dominated by the\nGreat Britain squad who took\nthe top five placings. However,\nthe performance from ICBC\nearned a mention by the\n\"Telegraph\" newspaper as being\n\"most impressive\". IC's rowers\nfinished the day as top club with\nthree winners pennants, and of\nthese the Senior 1 cox less fours\nwas the fastest sweep oared\nboat of the day, and included\nSimon Dennis and Lewis\nAtteral, who were selected for\nBritain for last August's World\nChampionships. The other two\npennants were for the Senior 2\nand Senior 3 cox ed fours, the\nformer stroked by Pete \"The\nMeat\" Wilson who performed\nthe same role in last year's victory in the Thames Cup at\nHenley. To their great credit, an\nIC quadruple scull finished\nsixth overall, beating all Notts\nCounty and London RC entries.\nAll in all, IC eclipsed the presence of all the other student\nboat clubs, including this year's Boat Race squads, and I am told\nthat they will improve even further in the coming season.\nSportsNews\nEngland manager Terry Venables'\njob looks safe tor now after a handsome\n3-1 win over Switzerland in Wednesday's friendly match at Wembley.\nAustralian leg spinner Shane\nWarne took four for 54 as his country\nbeat Pakistan by a resounding innings\nand 121 runs. These are in addition to the\nseven wickets he claimed in the first\nPakistani innings.\nFOOTBALL\nMEN'S IC v42 RLSB HI\nRSM 4 - 1 QMW\nRSM II 3 - 3 WYE\nWOMEN'S IC 2 - 1 RHUL\nRUGBY\nMEN'S IC 11 - 1 5 RHUL\nIC II 12 - 0 RHUL\nWOMEN'S VIRGINS 0 - 1 7 RHUL\nHOCKEY\nMEN'S IC 1 - 4 RHUL\nIC II 0 - 2 RHUL\nIC III 2 - 2 RHUL\nRSM 1 - 0 UCL III\nWOMEN'S IC I0 RHUL\nIC II 0 - 3 RHUL\nBADMINTON\nMEN'S IC 8 - 1 RHUL\nWOMEN'S IC 4 - 5 RHUL\nIC 7 - 9 ADDISON\nBASKETBALL\nMEN'S IC 76 - 44 UCL\nic 70 - 98 QMW\nic 76 - 85 LSE\nNETBALL\nWOMEN\nIC 25 - 34 RHUL\nFENCING\nMEN'S IC 1 7 - 9 RHUL\nWOMEN'S IC 1 0 - 8 QMW\n\n"

    "content": "TWENTY FOUR. FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 1 7TH1995 LETTERS\nI occasionally walk through\nPhysics so I'm quite happy that\nthe smokers have moved outside\n(although I haven't seen the\n\"crowds\" that were foretold).\nHowever, I accept that smokers\nhave a right to smoke - somewhere - but not near me if pos-sib le. Perhaps the secret tunnels\nunder IC do have a use after all\n- just a thought.\nSarah says... Dear Simon Baker,\nApparently you are a colum-nist, not a journalist, so you don't need to check your facts before\nwriting things. If you had bothered to do this before writing\nyour column for Felix 1040 I might have told you a bit more\nabout my involvement in the\n'ideological sack' that is New\nSolutions. I think you could safely call it more of a brief fling than\na steady relationship - I 've\nattended one meeting as a private individual in my own time,\nnot the Union's, received a few\ne mails and most importantly,\nI 've actually bothered to read the\npolicy document concerned. I find this makes expressing an\nopinion on the subject a lot e as i er, and perhaps if you spent a bit\nmore time researching and less\ntime indulging in scurrilous gossip about Ghassan's political aspirations your opinions would be a little more relevant. Perhaps you\ncould manage a nice little article\noutlining the policies of the two\nmain campaign groups - New\nSolutions, who back a system of\nincome contingent loans, and\nCampaign for Free Education,\nwho want a return to 1979 levels\nof grants and benefits, and then\nwe could all share the opinions of\nIC students on this one? I value\nthe fact that my NUS affiliated\ncolleagues have actually bothered\nto ask a troublesome misfit like\nICU to help them on this one,\nand it would be really nice if I could do my job and represent\nthe true feelings of IC students\nabout funding. Unfortunately, I need to know what these are\nfirst.\nAs to whether sabbaticals\nshould be concerning themselves\nwith the machinations of the\nNUS, unfortunately, overtly\npolitical or not it is still the only\neven vaguely representative student body in the country. They\nhave to develop a realistic funding policy and get it adopted by a political party in time for the\nnext election or student hardship\nwill become a even larger problem than it is already. I for one\ndo not intend to stick my nose in\nthe air and refuse to take part\nwhat will probably develop into\nthe most fundamentally important debate ever to affect Further\nand Higher Education just\nbecause of silly political differ-en ces. So please, let's worry\nabout the campaigns, not the\nulterior motives and party politics of the campaigners, who in\nthe end are just trying to promote an end to student hardship,\nhowever it's achieved.\nSarah White\nICU President\nPerhaps this should have\nbeen directed at Nooman\nHaque, who wrote the article in\nquestion, but I take your point. I myself have no great love or hate\nfor the NUS, but I believe it is\nvital that in these times of\nchange for students we must\nhave a body that can represent\nstudents on a national level. If\nwe do not then we must take pot\nluck with government (either\nLabour or Conservative) policy\nand suffer the consequences.\nAlarmed, of Selkirk Dear Ed,\nIt was interesting, even if not\nreassuring, to read that the fire\nalarms in Southside will continue\nto be tested until the end of\nNovember. What I am wondering\nis why these 'necessary' tests\noften seem to have taken pace\nbetween five and six in the afternoon when everyone is returning\nfrom lectures and either wants to\nget down to some work or simply\nsit down and relax. Why can't all\nthese tests take place at more\nacceptable times during the day?\nIt is also interesting to note\nthe misfortune for us students\nthat all the problems have starting occurring and require repairing and testing just as the high-paying summer guests have left\nand we have moved in.\nPaolo Cuomo\nSelkirk Hall\nHaving enjoyed the regular\nfire alarms in Garden Hall last\nyear I have no small degree of\nsympathy for you. Yet again it\nseems that Estates have handled\nthe issue with their usual degree\nof mismanagement and preference for conference guests over\nstudents.\nBut think yourself lucky\nthat you have not yet endured a drill at 8am in the pouring rain,\nafter a week of 3 false alarms,\njust to test that the system was\nworking. Why is it that every\nyear we are subjected to more\nfalse alarms? It's not what I call\nprogress.\nHizb ut again Dear Felix,\nI was perturbed to find, once\nagain, a \"Hizb-ut-Tahrir\" propaganda leaflet in my Physics\nDepartment pigeon hole today.\nIts contents were the expected\nanti-Israel, anti-democratic hot\nair that this militant society constantly spouts.\nTo distribute such material\nat any time is, in my opinion, at\nthe least utterly misleading, but\nin the light of recent events in\nIsrael, it is unforgivable. Yitzhak\nRabin and Shimon Peres have, in\nthe last few years, been treading\na treacherous path in attempts to\nmake peace with their ever-hos-tile neighbours, particularly the\nPLO - former sworn enemies and\nterrorists. That Rabin devoted\nhimself to this task is only now\nall too clear.\nMeanwhile, the bombardment of Israel by the Islamic fundamentalists has never stopped.\nThese suicide bombers, convinced that their despicable acts\nwill guarantee them a place in\nparadise, are spurred on by the\nlikes of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,\nwhose militaristic goals and propaganda sound ominously similar\nto those of Hizb-ut-Tahrir.\nPlease note - I am not a Jew,\nand although I spent the first six\nmonths of this year working in\nIsrael, most of the people I was\nassociated with were Arabs.\nSome of them have become very\nclose friends of mine, and I know\nthat each of them would back me\nup on everything I say here.\nI am not suggesting that\nIsrael has never made mistakes in\nits handling of some situations -there is no such thing as a perfect\ngovernment or people. But I would suggest that their record is\ncertainly no worse that that of its\nneighbours; or especially the\nMuslim fanatics, whose ultimate\naim continues to be the total\ndestruction of Israel, at any cost.\nI would urge everyone at IC\nto distance themselves from\nextremism of any form, but particularly the violent, racist organisation that is Hizb-ut-Tahrir.\nName withheld by request\nI won't attempt a detailed\nreply as I admit to not know\nenough about the issue. But I was saddened to see Hizb-ut Tah rir distributing leaflets so\nsoon after the tragic death of\nYitzhak Rabin, who was one of\nthat special breed of leaders who\nwas willing to sacrifice everything for peace.\nLetters may be commented\non by a guest editor whose\nopinions are not necessarily\nthose of the editor.\nDeadline for letters: 6pm Monday\nPlease bring your union\ncard for identification.\n\n"

    "content": "video: oasis\n- live by the sea**\nOasis seem to love touring. They love the rock\n'ri roll lifestyle, the hotels, the idea of throwing\ntelevisions out of random windows because, in\nliam's words, \"I can pay for it,\" and, of course,\nthe gigging.\nThe setup is almost unheard of. Noel, lead\nguitarist, stands completely still. Bonehead and\nGuigs (rhythm guitar and bass guitar) stand\ncompletely still. And Liarn, well, erm, he stands\nstill too. None of your Jimi Hendrix style licking\nthe guitar here or Mick Jagger style jerking\naround on stage. Each member of the band has\na spot to which they are glued and they stay\nthere. It's not that they can't do two things at\nonce. Rather, it's the fact that, in their minds, the\nshow is them, not what they do.\nThe confidence that this band has is stag-ge ring. Their cocky, \"We're the best band in the\nworld\", attitude has got them very far indeed\nand they don't need to perform like circus animals to entertain their audience. Their power is\nin their music. Straight rock 'n' roll - no messing\naround with pop or any of its sub-genres.\nThe whole Oasis ethic is carried through in\nthis video as they tear through their seventeen\nsong set with the kind of confidence that only\nbands who have been around forever should\nhave. They know that every song they play will\nbe received with a thousand cheers.\nLiam has a rapport with the audience that\nmost singers could only wish for and he knows\nit. He has that, \"I know everyone loves me but\nI'm pretending not to notice\", look const andy on\nhis face. As usual, he dedicates 'Slide Away' to\nthe \"ladies in the 'ouse\", and 'Live Forever' to\n\"everyone, including me.\"\nNoel's three song acoustic set (in this case,\ntwo and a half due to the fact that he couldn't remember how the last half of 'D 'yer wanna be\na spaceman' went) is gent iy beautiful and yet still\npowerful as it complements the electrified parts\nof the concert. The finale of 'I am the Walrus'\nfollows an\" energetic version of 'Supersonic' and\nis, as always, eight minutes of organised madness.\nGet this video, turn out the lights and play\nit with the sound way up. Oh, and if the ceiling\ndoesn't collapse and you don't cause an earth-quake, then you've not put it on loud enough.\nalbum: coolio -gangsta's paradise^\nJust in case you haven't listened to the radio or\nwatched MTV for the last few months, the tide\ntrack on this album went straight into the charts\nat No.l. And it's quite good in its chilling, even\nhaunting groove and scary-voice lyrics. A rare\nenough example of a good tune selling loads, and\na good way to shift copies of an album.\nUnfortunately, the album doesn't live up to\nits tide track. A host of special guests provide the\nodd good moment, but most of the time the\nbacking tracks are badly done or just copies of\nthe original R&B and funk tracks.\nCoolio seems to have forgotten his rap sen-sibi li ties. The old school influences are apparent\nbut he has lost his flair. Only the tide track and\ntracks such as the group jam, 'Exercise Yo\nGame', rise above the tedium. Buy the single and\nsave your money for albums by the guests\ninstead. (4)\nalbums: round-up\nSqueeze - 'Ridiculous'. There's nothing really\nwrong with this album except that it is a little\nboring. It's the same old pop formula; tried, tested and old hat. It's a shame 'cos they used to be\nquite good. (4) - Lucas\nVarious - 'Planet Dub'. Children of the Bong,\nAstralasia and Eat Static all contribute excellent\nambient soundscapes. Unfortunately, the rest of\nthis double LP is monotonous with never changing bass rhythms. (5) - Mr. Happy\nNext Step Up - 'Fall from Grace'. A pretty boring metal album. The band play confide nd y but\nthere is little variation while the singer sounds\nlike he had a bad case of sore throat during the\nrecording sessions. (4) - Ian\nVarious - 'Triphoprisy IF. This compilation uses\nthe tactic of having remixer s(e.g. Portishead)\nwho are far more famous than the original artists.\nIt's worth it because this a nice warm up record\nfor any night out.

FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 17TH1995 NEWS\nClayponds\nBurgled\nAgain\nBY DIANA HARRISON\nSecurity and well-being came\nunder the spotlight this week at\nClayponds, the College's residential estate in South Ealing.\nRecent residents' meetings have\ndiscussed the spate of burglaries\nwhich have hit the sit since the\nsummer. Residents have expressed fears for the safety of the\nstudents and postgraduates who\nhave to travel some distance to\nthe estate at night.\nThe meeting, held a week\nlast Tuesday, saw angry\nexchanges over College's refusal\nto provide a security guard. The\ngeneral feeling was that a guard\nwho could be on duty for a couple of hours in the early evening\n- which has been identified as a particularly vulnerable time for\nthe burglaries - would be a great\nhelp. Five days after the meet-ing, a ground floor flat on the\nestate was broken into via a win-dow, provoking calls for more\nsecure premises. Past discussions have led to the upgrade of\nthe security system, including\nthe use of passive IR detectors.\nTravel between the flats and\ncollege has been increasingly a source of worry for the res i dents, especially at night. The\npath from the tube station to\nClayponds passes between a high wall on one side and a council estate on the other.\nHarassment from children of the\ncouncil estate has caused problems for some residents, with\nsome students suffering stone\nthrowing by the children.\nAt the meeting, the warden\nreiterated his support for the\n'Clayponds Catwalk' scheme\n(known as the Clayponds Escort\nService), where Clayponds residents meet each other in college\nso that they can travel back to\nthe South Ealing flats together, a move welcomed by staff and\nstudents alike.\nAfter much wrangling, College have relented on Linstead Hall's bar and allowed it to open for bus i ness. Excited Linsteadians, keen to make up for lost drinking time, made good use of the bar, celebrating in time-honoured fashion.

Included in their\nhaul were four tables, assorted\npictures and wall hangings, six\npotted plants, a pew, two\nphones and a three seater sofa.\nThe party carried the\nobjects up to the Selkirk gallery,\nleaving behind ransom notes\nwherever the items were filched\nfrom. The obligation demanded\nfor the safe return of the items\nwas a \u00a350 cheque payable to the\nkidnappers nominated charity.\nArran, a member of the\naltruistic band, said that \"at the\ntime, it seemed the right thing\nto do.\" Unfortunately others did\nnot share his views. The assistant\nsub warden, Kay Goodyear,\nthreatened those involved with\nhall fines, and they were sentenced to undo their evening's work.\n\n"

The planning committee threw out Imperial's proposals to extend the Club premises\non Putney Reach, against the recommendation of the Borough's Planning Officers. IC Estates\nclaim that political intervention\nswung the verdict ahead of the\nBorough's planning policy.\nFrank Murray, the Estates\nManger overseeing the project,\nrepresented IC at last Monday's Planning meeting. Speaking to\nFelix, he said that the Councillors\nturned down the application on\nthe grounds of 'over-develop-ment of the site' and that the\nnew structure would be 'too big\nfor the location'. Stressing that\nImperial had worked hard to\nassuage the fears and concerns of\nthe local residents, he was surprised that problems which\nCollege had thought resolved\nwere brought up again by their\nlocal Councillor.\nThe plans were dismissed by\na single vote, four Labour\nCouncillors supporting the application and half the Conservative\nCouncillors abstaining from vo t ing. Ian Caldwell, IC's Director\nof Estates, said that the result\nshowed that the Councillors\nwere putting votes ahead of sport\nand leisure provision for the\nBorough, highlighting 'the irony\nof the situation...with the large\nnumber of voting students living\nin Putney.' There were suggestions that the committee had put\npolitical motives ahead of the\nadvice of their own Officers,\nwith sources citing the fact that\nresidents had petitioned the MP\nfor Putney and Wandsworth,\nDavid Mellor, to influence the\ndecision.\nIn a statement to Felix, Mr\nMellor said that he shared concern with the residents over an\nopportunistic application for a development of this scale in a conservation area.'

Lavishly produced with a cast of\nforty the costumes as well as the props reflect\nthe decadence of tum-of-the-century AustroHungary.\nThe choreography of the scene changes is\nimpressive, as almost all the cast appear and\nswap scenery behind some incidental act.\nOriginally refused a performance licence in 1965\nfor its frank portrayal of sexual relations, both\nstraight and gay, John Osborne's play tracks the\nWilby).\nDisplaying widespread homosexuality in\nthe Imperial armed forces, it seems more than\ncoincidence that the piece should resurface at a time when the British armed forces are facing\nthe same issue - a connection reinforced by the\nappearance in the programme of a foreword\nfrom Stonewall's director.\nNevertheless the glorious extravagance of\nthe production, crowned with an amazingly\ncamp ball scene, absorbs you as you pick out the\nfamiliar faces from television and the four hour\nepic flies by. michael lud lam London is the place of extremes. It is the\nmost amazing multi-cultured mix of men and\nwomen from all over the world. Ah, but then\nthere is Imperial. The place that is so different\nfrom the rest of London, not because it isn'ta mix of peoples, but because it is predominately\nfull of one gender: the male one. I realise that I haven't just made a startling new revelation to\nmost of you, but it really is something that you\ncan't help noticing. Where else can you find so\nmany men all alone in one place?\nI was promised that college was going to be\nin the 'real world' but it isn't. The real world just\ndoesn't have four times the number of men than\nwomen. In the 'real world' there just slightly\nmore women than men. In the big wide world\noutside of this college, including just about every\nother college and university in Britain there is\nmore or less an equal number of men and\nwomen. But here there aren't. The reason for this imbalance is simple. We\nall go to a science college. And for as long as anyone can remember, boys have been good at making things go tick and blow up, and women have\ndone all the artistic stuff. Unfortunately this attitude still prevails... and sucks. Women and men\nare equally intelligent - given all the same incentives It kink there would be as many women\ndoing science as men, and as many men doing\n'arty things' as women do.\nlike it or lump it, Imperial College is going\nto be male dominated for a long time to come.\nBut things are getting better. Each year more\nwomen come here, so the percentage of women\nat Imperial has risen to a giddy high of twenty\nseven. However, this still means there are three\nmen to every woman, accounting for the large\nsurplus of spare testosterone that floats around\nSouth Kensington. Let's talk at the basic level,\nwithout becoming too crude: there just aren't enough women to go round and somehow this\nodd situation has created special types of people\nthat seem to only exist at Imperial.\nFirstly, it takes a special type of tough\n.woman to come to Imperial, and I admire those\nwho do brave it. I can see it would be hard for\nmany women to have lots of friends here . If you\nare a woman at this college you are without\ndoubt being constantly chatted up. Trying to\ncomprehend this situation the other way\naround, I can only imagine going to a Swiss finishing school full of geeky boring women. The\nprospect seems vaguely enticing at first, but it\nwould drive me up the wall within a week. It\nmust be so intimidating for women here knowing that just about every blok e they talk to is\nsomewhere on the wrong side between normal\nand sheer bloody desperate. And while the\nattention is, I am assured, flattering it can hardly\nbe particularly comfortable.\nImperial seems to attract various types of\nwomen, but two in particular. Firstly the female\nequivalent of the male geek. Unattractive and\nsexless, the type who works so hard that they\nknow little about the outside world. Then there\nare the women who come here who choose\nImperial because of the imbalance which makes\nthem that much more desirable. They are the\nones who enjoy knowing that there are plenty of\nmen to choose from and that their choice is end-less. It is such a shame this little ploy does not\nwork. Didn't anyone tell them that a considerably large proportion of this college comes from\nthe male geek factory?\nSo while most of the men at Imperial are\ndefinitely available, only a tiny minority are in the\nleast bit desirable. Let's be honest with ourselves\nguys, we are hardly a model show for the rest of\nmankind. We can't really be proud of our show\nof bristling attractiveness. It also requires a special type of man to come to Imperial-one who\nknows that his early twenties will be spent single\nand competing with at least two other men for a woman. It is a sad thought-wasted youth and all\nthat.\nThis observation of the imbalance in college\nis hardly a new one. Never a day goes pass when\nsome reference is not made to the lack of\nwomen (and lack of 'decent blok es') attending\nIC. Every year the same arguments come back\ntime and time again. The thing is, there ain'ta great deal you and me can do about it. I'm afraid\nto say it, but it's true. College themselves are the\nonly ones who will be doing anything about it,\nbecause they are the only ones who can. And so\nwhile they get along with the arduous task the\nrest of us will just have to keep on w hinging about it. Ah, we do it so so well.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 1 7TH1995. THREE\nMedical School Principal Moves In\nRag Chair\nAppeal Fail\nBY TOM STEVENS\nRichard Willis, ex-Rag Chair, has\nappealed unsuccessfully against\nthe Executive ruling on his role\nin the Rag fresher's promotion.\nThe event aimed to attract\nfresher s by handing out shots of\nspirits. It all went wrong when\none over-enthusiastic student\ndrank too much and was discovered nearly paralytic outside the\nSherfield Building.\nA Union Disciplinary held\nover the affair was fraught with\ncontroversy with some claiming\nit was held in an unconstitutional manner and even that it\nshould never have been held in\nthe first place.\nIn the face of criticism, Mr\nWillis was found guilty of 'failing\nto act responsibly as the organiser of an event' and of 'bringing\nthe Union into disrepute.' He\nwas fined \u00a375 and the committee recommended a motion of\nno confidence should go to\nCouncil, a move that almost certainly would lead to Willis losing\nhis position as Rag chair.\nMr Willis instantly took the\nstory to Felix with claims of mis-conduct, and further that he had\nbeen expelled from the Union, a claim Sarah White , later\ndescribed as \"absolute bollocks\n...there was no question of him\nbeing expelled.\"\nMr Willis resigned his chair,\npre-empting a possible vote of\nno confidence and sought an\nappeal. Unfortunately for Willis\nthe appeal committee which\nmet last Friday failed to find\nfault with the original ruling;\nhowever it did concede that the\nfine was excessive and agreed to\nreduce it to \u00a340.\nMr Willis was quoted as saying that the second hearing 'was\nvery fair'. He accepted the\nboard's recommendation to\nreduce his fine and agreed to\nabide by their decision.\nThe leader less Rag Committee elected John Lambert as\ntheir new Rag chair on Wednesday, just in time for Rag Week.\nBY JENNY RUDSTONE\nChris Edwards, a new member of\nthe College management team,\nhas joined Imperial as Principal of\nthe Medical School. He started\nwork only last week but feels he\nhas settled in rapidly.\nHe comes to us after being\nProfessor of Clinical Medicine at\nthe University of Edinburgh for\nthe last fifteen years, as well as\nDean of the Faculty of Medicine\nand Provost of the Faculty Group\nof Medicine and Veterinary\nMedicine over the last four years.\nDr Edwards has also been on\nvarious Government groups in\nScotland and may in the future\nbe asked to represent both\nUniversity and NHS interests\nfrom London-based groupings.\nHe has also been a member of\nThe Medical Research Council\nover the last four years and a Governor of the Welcome Trust\nfor the past two.\nHis role is to unite and provide leadership for all the students of St. Mary's Hospital\nMedical School, Charing Cross\nand Westminster Medical\nSchool, the Royal Postgraduate\nBY MARK BRIDGE\nIC Conference Centre staff are\nreallocating bookings to other\nparts of college. The Southside\nsuite will cease to function at\nChristmas to make way for the\nmove of the health centre.\nWork at the site will commence within four weeks from\nnow. The project to convert the\nbasement to General Practice\nspecifications will be completed\nby mid 1996. The changeover is\nexpected to be finished by\nOctober.\nSpeaking to Felix, Dr. Peter\nDorward of the Health Centre\nexplained that the current 14\nPrince's Gardens site has small\nwaiting rooms, narrow corridors\nand many staircases making\naccess for the disabled very diff i cult. It also impedes the\nstretcher ing of patients from the\nMedical School and the National\nHeart and Lung Institute, pr ovid college ambulance.\nThe centre currently has\nthree nurses, four psychotherapists, a psychiatrist, an\nosteopath, a sports and a complimentary medicine specialist as\nwell as doctors available for con-sul t ation. This, coupled with the\nfact that the number of patients\n(currently 60% student, 15%\nstaff, and 25% residents) is set to\nincrease to ten thousand within\ntwo years, necessitates the move.\nTalks between the Estates\ndepartment, the Health Centre\nand the Health Commissioning\nAgency oi Kensington and\nChelsea (the quango responsible\nfor funding healthcare in the bor-ough) have lasted over a year and\nrecently culminated in the\nannouncement.\nFunding was helped by government recognition that London\ning them with excellent teaching\nand facilities.\npractices are generally run down\ncompared with the rest of the\ncountry. Health Centre staff say\nthat the building is generally in a state of disrepair. There are\ncracks and exposed wiring and\nthe frequent requirement for\nstaff to share rooms leads to an\nunsuitable working environment.\nAll the staff participated in\nthe planning stages and have tailored their rooms and workplaces\nto their individual needs and\npreferences as well as to the\nfunctions they are going to be\nused for. Dr. Dorward expected\nthis to allow '...people to thrive,\nperformance to improve and efficiency gains to be made'.\nThe final plans, the fifth in a series of revised and amended\ndrafts, incorporate a specific section for counselling as well as a larger waiting room.\nConference Centre to Closed by Xmas\n\n"

TWENTY-SEVEN\nBadminton\nLadies Go Down\nWith the mysterious disappearance of Szun Szun before the\ngame, IC's Ladies badminton\nteam were down to only five\nplayers, as were Royal Holloway,\nwhich meant that, due to the biz-z are nature of the sport, five of\nthe nine matches were void.\nWhilst the \"smashing\" form\nof Mighty Mo and Crazy Chan\nwas not enough to overcome the\nstrength of RH, Blabbermouth\nBhabuta and Nippy Nakayama\nplayed superbly to win both their\nmatches. Due to \"technicalities\",\nthough, these valiant efforts\nproved to be in vain, as IC went\ndown 5-4. Never mind, blame it\non Szun Szun.\nThe men's side enjoyed a comfortable 8-1 thrashing over\ntheir RHUL counterparts.Upon\ntheir eventual arrival on the\npitch, IC had all the early posses-sion, but due to some fancy footwork from RH, and some highly\ndubious umpiring decisions, they\ntook the lead. \"Chip Shop\",\nthough, rallied the team, and IC\nforced the draw with two cork ers from \"Yokel\" and \"Curtains\".\nHas anyone seen \"Rab\"'s pants?\nIC Vth's Comeback\nIC's fifth team took on RLSB's3 rd XI last Saturday, and an\napprehensive start saw Bart's unlucky to be only 2-0 up at the\nhalf time oranges. A stirring team\ntalk inspired first Ryan to score\nfrom a narrow angle, then a twenty minute hat-trick from Nigel\nturned the match entirely.\nA docile 'keeping error and a very poor last ten minutes denied\nRSM II a deserved win. Two\ngreat goals from Mauritz and a delicate chip from Dave looked\nto have given them the victory,\nbut an exposed lack of pace at\nthe back gave Wye the equalise r. The RSM first team though\nweighed in with their best performance of the season to trounce\nQMW III 4-1.\nFencers Take\nDivision\nby Storm\nImperial's men's fencing team\nclinched the divisional title on\nWednesday by beating Royal\nHolloway 17-9. Previous wins\nover UCI (18-9), King's(1710), and QMW (15-12) ensure IC a good seeding for the knockout\nrounds, and with a full strength\nsquad, they must be amongst the\nfavourites for the title.\nThe women's team have\nfared less well, having had problems in fielding a good team.\nThey did manage a hard fought\nvictory over QMW, finally triumphing 10-8. Credit is due to\nLinda Little, whose dedication\nthis season has been noted.\nIC Girls out-muscled in\nhard encounter\nThe time had come for IC's biannual battle with Royal\nHolloway. Sporting flack jackets\nand helmets we ventured on\ncourt to find that, once again,\nthere were to be no referees.\nThe new look team played\nwell in the first quarter to lead\n8-6. Holloway caught up in the\nsecond, though their centre\nseemed to pay more attention to\nthe legs of IC's goal-attack than\nto chasing the ball. The game\nremained close until the last\nquarter, when Holloway's greater physical presence finally\ntook its toll, and they extended\ntheir lead to an unassailable 34 -25 margin.\nThe game was at times\nflowing but Imperial were still\nnot hardened enough to beat\nRH.\n| CARIBBEAN SO Pl i^,l^l lt IMPERIAL COLLE QE HOW CAS YO D HE HOW S') TOM/GMT\nUNION CONCERT HALL\n'2 FK Kl IMMWQ: WITH ill TMB1 TIO ML MM SWING^ wv \u00bb !\n>\n!

SEVEN\n::>:AAA\nTht Lmd 'f romance and dreams - or so pe o ip^say Florence is also perhaps the only city\nwhere people |ud ge status by your footwear.\nIt's time to throw out those DM's and invest\nin some kinky boots.\nItalian universities often have few or no\nuniversity halls, but they normally provide\nprivate accommodation for you. (Ask if bedding etc. is there for you.) Florence even goes\nas far as to sub sid is e the rent by approximately \u00a335-40 per month. This money could\nbe even better spent by joining one of the\nnumerous small members only bars/rest au rants. To join they only need a small fee and\nthen the food, drink and general ambience on\noffer is superior to the alternative. Try \"la\nPentola d 'Oro\" in Florence for the best reasonably priced Renaissance food. Though the\nItalian student canteens do offer the usual\nEuropean excellent value three course meals\n(around \u00a31.20), the main difference is that\ntheirs come with wine. A relaxed place;\nwhere they \"don't do today what can be.:g||| off until tomorrow.\"\nIf ViSjl MS (understandably) worried about\nterm times, <\n>\n> com mod ation, travel, money,\netc. ask as soon as von are given a contact.\nLots of people experience teething problems\nwith: flats / halls - they are sorted out very\nquickly. The general philosophy is \"they'll do\nit but you have to ask.\"\nTerm usually starts a week or so later\nthan here, but you may be expected to attend\na language / introductory course there. After\nthat holidays are pretty relaxed - find out\nwhat suits you and your course.\nTravelling is tricky (persuade your folks\nto give you a lift) but flying is generally the\nleast awkward, ask to be met at the other\nend. Be forceful - explain that you will have\nluggage, no idea of where you are and the lan-AJovely place! First things first - the French\niast a all v respect students! Imagine it - people\ngp Bf io know that what you are doing (i.e. enjoying yourself) is worthwhile! (Yes, they\nare mad.)\nThe French also offer Housing Benefittricky to get around the bureaucracy, you\nwill need to provide a full sized (has to be\nrequested in England apparently) birth cer-tif i cate, residence permit and bank refer-en ces. But if you can stand \"the Anneka Rice\nTreasure Hunt around Government Offices\"\nyou will have a significant portion (\u00a340-\u00a360\nper month) of your rent paid for (take note\nMr Major).\nThe system of \"CROUS\" or \"restaurant\nuniversitaire\" - which provides students with\nthree course meals for around \u00a31.50 is not to\nbe sniffed at. The cooking facilities in Halls\nare admittedly limited, but then with meals\navailable for that price - who cares?\nWine (as well as nuclear testing) is\nextremely popular. Look out for \"app elation control lee\" or a green top on a label for\nexcellent cheap plo nk. In France you'll need phone cards, have\nto visit EuroDisney and listen to 102.3FM for crazy English radio. Also look out for\nFNAC - a government record store of sorts\nwhich provides excellent lunchtime con-cert s. And if you are planning to visit the cinema in Strasbourg - buy your student ticket\nbetween 5:30-6:30pm. II ' . r|.. r\"\\gu age level of a three year old. They will help.\nMoney is a bit of a gamble. Exchange\nrates mean that unless you're an economic\ngenius you can lose out (or gain) whatever\nyou do. Investigate credit and EC cards, but\na bank account is usually necessary for one to\ntwo vital transactions. It can be cheaper to\nexchange your money in one bulk trans ac tion. Ask someone to help out and find out\nthe full facts before you go (look for hidden\ncharges).\nLife in Europe is a once-in-a lifetime\nexperience, which is not to be missed: the\nculture shock, the sophistication of European\nstudents (they have dinner parties), the way\nthey celebrate their birthdays whenever it\nsuits and not when they actually occur and\n^j ll l^l pu crat ic nightmare of a country, but\nHHjpkal sausage and sauerkraut-eating folk\nperi I all that bad. When they party they do\nit it's in style. Don't miss the \"Karnevals\" of\nFebruary and many smaller curious customs\nboth in and out of the universities. Erlangen\nhas a particularly popular ten day beer festival in the beginning of June. They are great\nbelievers in cakes at 3pm( who's complain-ing?) and Sekt (German champagne).\nThey also believe in putting people of a common background together - so beware of\nonly meeting foreigners. Germany philosophy hasn't grasped the fact that people want\nto learn German by meeting Germans. (Also\nbe prepared to do your shopping in the\nmornings as having shops open after 3pm seems to be a sin.)\nPhone boxes are fun. They're yellow and\nonly accept incoming calls if they have a ringing phone symbol on the front - so hunt\naround for one. You will need a bank account\nto pay for rent and in Hannover at least you\nhave to pay (\u00a375 per semester) to be a student - but in return you travel on public\ntransport for free and there is a variety of\nfree sports lessons available. For an illustration in German efficiency try the university\ncanteen (the \"Mensa\").\nthe lack of \"The Sun\" all mean it can be\nslightly bizarre. Yet life without the great\nBritish cup of tea in front of Eastenders all\nseems somehow worthwhile when sat in a bar\nat 4am. If you have any questions then Adrian\nHawksworth at the International Office\n(room 321, Sherfield) deals with non-academic en qu ries. Your European\nDepartmental Coordinator will deal with any\nacademic problems.\nSpecial thanks for contributions go to\nKaren, Alick, Graham, Karen, Walter, Tom,\nAlex, Clare, Tilly and Vicky.
