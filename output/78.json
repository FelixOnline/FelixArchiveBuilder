    "content": "2 FELIX PROFILE FRANK G. IRVING\nTime: - Some time in May.\nPlace: - Calais Customs.\nEnter Prank Irving with Lome Welch arguing;-with an\nuncooperative immigration officer. They were explaining how\nneither of them had passport or papers after their epic flight\nto Belgium. \"It does not matter,\" said the official.\"there ara\nrules and regulations to he observed.\"\n\"Oh, o 'est le SPORT.\" replied Prank. The of fi oi al smiled\nbenignly, and went on to boast about the English soccer defeat\non the previous day.\nPrank Irving was bora in Liverpool in 1925. He was a pupil\nat ST.Edwards College Liverpool and later studied CIVIL( but of course ) Engineering at Liverpool University where his\ninterest in gliding was awakened by reading Kronfald's works on\ngliding. After this he spent a brief period as a Junior scientific\nofficer at the Empire Test Pilot School where he survived one\np rang. He came to I.C. in1945 taking up aP.G. course in the\nAero. Dept. which gave him aD.I.C. Prank graduated through\nthe realms of a demonstrator, a lecturer c, and even finally\nbuilding wind tunnels. When the I.C. Sliding Club re-com men oed their activities in1946, Frank was there, and he went with\nthem to RedhiOl and then on to Lasham in 1951. He has been,\nand still is, a member of the Technical Committee of the British eliding Association. And, incidentally, the glider in which'\nhe crossed the Channel belongs to the \"EAGUB\" comic. Frank will,\nif you buy him a drink, relate how a crowd of screaming children\ninvaded the glider, shouting \"It belongs to me, MISTER.\"\nHis likes: naturally enough, Gliding. Literature, and especially Robert Graves' writing. And continental touring with\ngreat big trailers (guess what's in them).\nDislikes: On ol oae questioning, he broke down and admitted that cold water and milk bottles from the Old Hostel are\namong his more fervent dislikes. Said Frank,\" I dislike this\nconventional routine dreary exist e noel\" As Dean of Residents,\nhe Bhould find the routine anything but dreary and conventional.\nHIGHWAYMAN RALLY\nAt 1 min. intervals from 11 a.m.,18 competitors\nleft the I.C. Union on the 1st stage to Hettlebed, Oxen.\nThe Rally was meant to be difficult. It was not intended that the difficulties should include the introduction\nof deliberate mistakes, but, owing to an unfortunate\nerror on the Route-card, most Competitors left London\nvia A40 instead of A4, thereby by-passing the 1st Control.\nFrom the confusion thus caused, most competitors\nrecovered well. R.M. Devlon and crew (Austin A30) made\na very good run to finish only 10 mins. behind time and\nthe only casualty was R.M. Walker (Ariel 500), last seen\nwith a wheel out. J. Allen (Norton International) is\nreported to have taken an escape road after'motoring\nsideways for some considerable distance towards a woman\npushing a pram; nevertheless, he arrived at Nsttlehead\nready for more.\nWith a few exceptions, competitors started the 2nd stage on time. From bearings, dist a noes, latitude and\nlongitude, and map references, they had to locate, visit\nand reo or d the names of a number of Inns. They then\nhad to intercept a Moving Control wh i oh was operating\nalong the lok niel d Way before covering a final regularity\nsection to the finish.\nLaok of knowledge of the Ordnance Survey Map delayed some competitors around the Inns but some very\ngood interceptions were made on the Moving Control, particularly by D.M. Watson and M. Walsh (Austin 7) Mike\nNeale and Laurie Stevenson (Morris Minor) and G.B. Darling (Ford Prefect). Potentially the most brill isnt was by Ian Duff (Morria 8) who hurtled across the bows\nof the Control Car with all the ^mv2 of Aston Hill behind him. His unseeing eyes strained ahead; anything\no loa er than ^ mile away was probably too blurred to be\nvisible.\nAt the Chequers Hotel, Uxbridge (the Final Control)\nMike Neale o he oke d in 25 mins. before anyone else, but\none by one all save a gentleman on aB.S. A. arrived.\nIn the Bar, the results were an noun oed. Outright Winner - Mike Neale and Laurie Stevenson (Mor-ris Minor)\nRunner-up - D.M. Watson and M, Walsh (Austin 7)\n3r dR.M. Barlow and or ew( Austin A30)\n2\n1st Motorcyole - J. Allen - Q.M. C.( NortonInternational)\nThough they had suffered many frustrations, everyone seemed to have enjoyed the day thoroughly. In a few oases, the reason was not hard to seek, and perhaps\nJ. D.R., who took \u20141\u2014nL no-st-r in his oar and ran\nout of petrol twice, can but give the answer to that one.\nSTUDENTSHIP: EXAM-MANSHTP:\n\"Ah, at last the exams are nearly here...\"\nOne very rarely hears su oha remark as this,\nparticularly from a student at I.C. But, believe\nme, the speaker (who shall be nameless) has my full\nbacking. Are you taken aback at this blatant exclamation? You are? Good. That is exactly the effect\nit is supposed to have on you.\nThe speaker is obviously a Lifeman, and you, by\nshowing your astonishment, have given him just what he\nwanted: that supreme feeling of \"one-up\".\nThe effect of your reaction does not just stop at\nthe \"annoyed\" stage.'I Far from it... Your immediate\nsecond thought is \"Good gracious (or similar words)\nthis man obviously knows the work, and merely accepts\nthe exams, as a pure formality. Your second action\nis to work at such a pace that when the exams do oom e your brain is absolutely fumbled, you seem to be living\nin another world, you are obsessed, dead^. Worried, and\na nervous w re ok. In short, you have been Ployed!\nTo help you along in your struggles in June (thinks\n... \"Have I ploy ed myself?\") here is a little bit of\nexam-man ship which should help you along.\nThe dreaded morning has arrived. But you are not\nflustered, and to hurry is the last thing that has entered your head.\nIn one hand you carry an extremely small light\nbrown bag with the bare essentials for your task, which,\nwhen you o on side rit couldn't be simpler!\nIn the other hand you carry your first ploy: A large travelling bag full of back numbers of Reveille,\nWeekend Mail etc., and under the arm, held very ostensibly, the Times, Telegraph, and Manchester Guardian.\nUp to the room which is going to torture your in-fer i or s. Take your time, let the brown bag gers rush\nby you: as they pass a very oh eery \"Good morning\" is\nnot out of pla oe. Take your pla oe in the bustling throng of nervous\nwrecks. Start to read the Times, and attempt to distribute the contents of your travelling bag. You will\nobviously get such remarks as \"For \u2014-\u2014 sake, put them \u2022\naway!\" Your retort is \"Good gracious, anyone would\nthink you were just going into an examination!\"\nThe appointed hour arrives: A bent gentleman will\nlook over spectacles from the door and say in a monotone \"All right, you may oom e in now\".\nTake your time, for after all, it is your own!\nMake a point of going in last, perhaps even two minutes\nlate, just to enjoy your cigarette the better!\nSit down, quite casually, and continue reading the\npaper. (The newspaper, obviously!) Only stop when\ntold to. This small diversion has already distracted\neveryone, and the question they thought they were just\nbeginning to understand ii ow appears oom p let ely transformed before their eyes to absolute \"undo able s\" and\n\"next question\" types.\nNow your major ploy! Pick up the exam paper and,\nwith a very o on tented look oh your fao e, ostensibly\ntick off all question as \"do-able s\", and then, amid\nblu ater of sharpening pen oils, blowing nose, and undoing\n\"Spangles\" look p uz sled, as if considering wh i oh question to do first, as they all seem so easy.\nNow take the answer book, and write absolute bunk\nfor 20 minutes, with o on s tant underlining, with your\nparticularly scratchy pen: specially bought for the\njob! You can write your name 10 times if you like,\nbut by now, it is obvious what chaos you have caused\nin your \"opponents'\" minds.\nYou now have a small break from plo ying, and do\n4 questions Then, a casual question to the\nin vigil at or such as \"Is there a mistake in the printed\nanswer for question 5?\" will shatter your contestants,\nfor they haven't even got an answer!\nTime is now running out, but stay to the end.\nDo not join in post-mortem s with the brown bag gers, and\nwhen asked what you thought of the paper, some suo h comment as \"Wizard\" will fix them.\nHave a quick snack for lu noh, and suggest a row\non the Serpentine. If the idiots accept, make sure\nyou are sitting in the stern. After all, you don't want to tire yourself, or blister your hands.\nBack for the afternoon session, and out in a similar manner to the way you acted in the morning.\nTrusting this will help those life men among you,\nI remain, yours , very un worried ly, EDMUND BEE.\n\n"

Pour crews entered for the division I: U.C.H., Berts'.\nThonas's and I.C.I. C. beat U.C.H. in the first heat and\nBarts in the final, winning both races by 1-j lengths.\nIn Division II (The Roderic Hill Memorial Trophy)\nthe 2nd eight beat L.S.E. I and Kings I in their first\ntwo heats and met Battersea Poly, in the final. One m minute from the end I.C. were f length down but with a very strong finish drove it home to win by f length.\nTo complete the day's successes the if th eight won\nthe clinker division beating L.S,E, II easily in their\nfirst heat and KingsII in the final.\nI.C. also entered a clinker IV which had a bye into\nthe final only to be beaten by L.S.E. TWICKENHAM AND 7\n/\nALTON REGATTAS.\nAt Twickenham on May 28th the 3rd eight entered the\nJuniors \"but lost to Staines in the semi-final after\nbeating Twickenham R.C. and Southampton University in\ntheir previous races.\nJune Vfch saw I.C. at Walton Regatta where the 3rd eight beat Rings I only to be beater a again by Staines\nin the semi-final. The 2nd eight lost to Walton who were\nthe eventual winners of the Junior- Seniors and the first\neight were beaten by Molesey in their first heat.\nCRICKET\nI. C.v Hook (Hants.)\nIoC. made their annual pilgrimage to village cricket\nat Hook, near Basingstoke, on Whit Monday and emerged\ntriumphant by 56 runs. The wet pitch caused a delayed\nstart, and this necessitated a change in batting order:\nsc that the least inebriated of the party should tackle\nthe tricky wicket first. This they did to such effect\nthat a score of 136 - 9 was reached. At this stage R. Dytha.ni strode to the wicket with an air of confidence\nthat was not shared by his colleagues. However, this\nrustic cricketer smote two towering sixes - the first\ntime that he has exceeded 2 for the college - and returned to the pavilion accompanied by frenzied applause\nand cries of \"Speech!\"\nHook were soon in trouble against the fast attack\nof Heam (4 for 21 ) and Dytham. They would have had\nto bat one short but for the valiant efforts of an aged\nmember of the crowd who responded eagerly to a shouted\nappeal to \"bat for Hook\" by donning pads over his grey\nflannels and braces and hitting 14 not out before Hook's last wicket fell at 92. I.C.'s fielding was not too\nbad considering the enormous lunch, and this year the\nreturn journey was accomplished without any serious differences of opinion with the vast hordes of police patrolling the main road.\nThe 1st XI has now won 6 and drawn 3, t) ut will lose\nits unbeaten record if the catching does not i jn prove, especially close to the wicket. The most recent results\nare :-Q. M.C.99,I. C.1009( Shepherd 26, Smith 22)\nI.C.1459 dec. (Oldland 2*2), Trinity Hall ,Cambridge\n125 - 8.\nI.C.148, Hook 92.\nL.S.E.71( Regan 3 - 6), I.C.752( Shepherd 38\nn.o., Kitchener 29 n.o.) HERBERT TENNIS CLUB REACH U.L SEMI-FINALS\nThis year the club has had a rather varied season,\nwinning only four and drawing two of the d even matches\nplayed. Two of these victories have been in the U. L.oup competition, and so the club still has a chance to\nretain the trophy for a further year.\nIn the 1st round of the cup, the opponents were\nBarts. Hospital and a keen struggle developed the score\nreaching 4-4j this being partly due to the valiant\nefforts of a medio, who first attended Barts, in 1939\nand is still waiting to write M.D. after his name.\nIn the deciding match the I.C. Second pair, D. Ward and D. Gregory looked on paper a winning comb in a tion, but again Barts., who were proving tough opp osi tion, won the 1st set 6-4 and led 4-0 in the second set.\nAt this stage however the I.C. pair put up a great\nrally and with Ward finding his. nor r iial form, they went\non to win the next twelve games, thus putting I.C. in\nthe quarter finals.\nIn the quarter final we met <\n'\nj \u00bb\ni \u00ab\n[\nBC. who unfortunately were not at full strength due to a subversive\nelement of Brown Baggers in their team. The I.C. team favoured by a rather lucky draw of opponents, played\nmuch better than in the preceeding round and went on\nto win 5-1 \u2022 'The Q. vI.C. team contained two U.L. players.\nIn the semi-final the club play C.E. Ii.' the result\nof wh i oh should be known before this publication\nI.C. W.B.C. The I.C. W.B.C. four now feel thoroughly est-a blis he d, having competed in their- regatta. This was\nthe University of London Summer fours, held over a mile course at Chiswiok on Saturday, June 4th. Nine\ncrews were entered in the novices division and I.C, finished a close fourth after one of their best rows\nto date. The crew has progressed amazingly well over\nthe last two weeks, mainly due to some very helpful\ncoaching, and with a little more racing experience,\nand with a little more \u2022 * \u2022 experience they should\nfare better in the future.\nCox - Rosemary Shaw\nStr.- Janet Walsby\n3 - Edith Stephen\n2 - Jean Osborne\nBow - Shirley Holman\nU.L. SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIPS\nThe I.C, team did not do quite so well here as\nthey might have hoped. The result was a win for L.S.E. with King's second and I.C.a very close third.\nIn the individual events, Mike Clark gained a comfortable win in the 100yd s, backstroke and EricHemmingway swam very well to gain 3rd. place in the\nbreaststroke. Useful points were also obtained by\nStewart and &>y in the butterfly and 440yd? re spot iv ely. The team races, which score the most points,\nwere both won by I.C. last year and provided the main\nexcitement of this year's Championships. In tha medley\nheats, I.C. were a slow third, but after a thoughtful\nreshuffle of the team and very fine swims by all, the\nfinal resulted in a close first place for I.C.j their\nthird successive win in this event. The freestyle\nrelay was even closer, with King's beating I.C. by a to u oh. The timekeepers could not separate the two\nteams who both recorded 68 sees. It was this event\nwhich gave King's their lead over I.C. in the final\npoints. The teams were:-Medley: G. Stewart, T. Robinson, M. Clark, C. McChesney.\nFreestyle: G. Stewart, T. Hoy, C.

I He has to see that we never run short of typists or paper, of gum or ink, and he has the unenviable\njob of transporting the layout to the printer by motor-bike. / This latter he will lend to an incapable and\nuninsured editor, on the o on d it ion that he gets it back in \"one piece\".\nJohn Pownall, our treasurer, has at least some financial integrity - we hope J He puts in a lot of hard\nwork and it will take a good man to replace him when\nhe leaves at the end of this term.\n\"Mad Mike?, alias Kike the Turner, is a sporting\nman and well fitted to be sports editor. He takes v his job seriously, a little too seriously in fact, for\non one occasion recently he was seen to be stuck on\ntop of the pole vault, and I have a photograph.to,prove\nit. He denies that Herbert is a ear ioa tur* him-self, saying it looks more like Nelson. He is ably\nassisted with athletic reports by Trevor Bailey, who\none day hopes to learn how a typewriter works.\nWho is Nelson? John Bramley is a miner, and\nsmokes a peculiar nicotine mixture known as \"Wayside\nDroppings\" in a hollowed-out lump of fossilised wood.\nWe call him Nelson because he has to stand on a hundred foot column when he smokes his pipe. To be serious for a moment,Nelson's Column is a fine piece of\nwriting, and it3 success is solely due to John's ability with a pen (and his big toe).\nRobin Crouch is our art editor. He is also an\nold boy of my school, where I knew him as \"slouchy\nCrouchy\", and he knew me by an even ruder title.\nHis ability is not limited to art however, and he reduced one FELIX Board meeting to tears with his own\ncaustic \"brand of humour.\nWhenever I cry for news from R.C.S., Geoff.

If you have done any developing yourself, you will know what a long job this can be.\nMiss Paddy Clarke is our secretary, a thankless\ntask which she does extremely well. It is noticeable\nthat the Business Manager, Bill Hudson, and the secretary take a keen interest in the running of the paper.\nBill is a miner with a flaming red beard, which grew\nafter he drank a bottle of his distilled orange squash*\nThere are many other members of the FELIX-staff,\nlike Johnny Dearden, who is new to us. He is a photographer and helps to edit sport. These are the\npeople who make FELIX what it is: a newspaper.\nOur thanks r are also due to the London College of\nSecretaries, Miss Larcom in the Bookstall, Mrs. Hebb\nin the Union Office, our salesmen in all the Colleges\nand, of course, our printer, S 'il vous plait.\nTHE THATCH ON THE MAP\nB.M.17654 ft. O.D. RETURN TO SILWOOD BY THE MEN OF COURAGE\nThis is the height that Guilds third year Mechanicals found the Thatched Tavern to be during the Survey\ncourse at Silwood at Easter. A bench mark was struck\nbeneath the door to commend this fact to further generations of Mechanical engineers on survey courses, for\nthis was the first time that so large a group of mechanical s had been to Silwood. On Monday night 3M chartered a coach and returned to Silwood to erect a brass\nplaque as a permanent record of their find. (The coach\nwas a safety precaution to avoid accusations of drunken\ndriving on the return journey.)\nThe plaque was fixed to a beam above the bar and\nwas unveiled by the landlord's wife.\nAfter an excellent evening the party returned to\nLondon rather less sober than when they set out. One\nmember mistook the window for the door on entering the\nbus - unfortunately, the window was closed, but entry\nwas effected nevertheless. The coach came home via\nSilwood drive where the magnificent time of 1 min.53\"5\nsees, was put up over the Motor Club sprint course (11*2\nm.p.h.) On returning to I.C. hostel they were greeted by\na deluge of water from above.

Sonsequently, I.C. found themselves rather out of their depth\nin spite of many good performance.\nThe two matches at Harlington, although poorly sup-ported, were both very enjoyable and resulted in vic-xo ries for I \u00abC \u00bb. L.S.E. and Koyal Vets, were beaten in\na match which proved closer than expected; the outstanding performance coming from Terry Hyslop whose time of\n15*5 sees, for the hurdles further reduced his own I.C. record. A week later a very small team scored an easy\nwin over Barts. Hospital in a match remembered more for\nits social side than for any high standards of per for Last Saturday the Club faced their hardest task\nof the season when they shared a coach with Kingf\ns to\ntravel to Loughborough for a four cornered match. A3\nexpected, Loughborough were easy winners with a strong\nBirmingham University team second, I.C. third and King's fourth. I.C.'s two wins came in the 880 yd s. and mile,\nth the former, Gordon Stewart was content to lie 2nd until the 660 yd s. mark when he went away to win easily\nwhile Les Locke came through from last to 2nd over\nthe last 220 yd s. Trevor Bailey employed similar\ntactics to win the mile comfortably. Second places\nwere gained by Stewart in the 440 yd s. Hyslop in the\n120 yd s. hurdles and Pinsent in the 44-0 yd s. hurdles.\nSmellock and Lawrence were unfortunate in that personal\nbest performances could only gain them 3rd and 4th places in a hop, step and jump where a mere 5 inches\ncovered the six competitors. In the pole vault, Colman was 3^d and iS nell pc k amazed everyone including himself by clearing 9 feet for 4th place. 3rd and 4th pla oe3 were also gained by Hobson and Browne in the\nlong jump which was won by Olewir of Loughborough with\na leap of 23 ft. H^ ins, - one of the best jumps in\nthis country this season.\nA frantic loudspeaker announcement resulted in\na hurried rush away from the hammer throw after Dave\nLangdon had almost caused mass slaughter by heaving the\nmissile backwards over his head.\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT.\nAs you know, to-day's \"Felix\" is the last one this\nterm. The first \"Felix\" next term is the \"FRESHERS'\nFELIX\", and it is published BEFORE the bulk of the College returns to the grindstone - about five days before,\non the Friday, Saturday, .and Sunday. It means, of\ncourse, that all material MUST be edited and compiled\nat least ten days before the Friday on wh i oh we publish\n- not later than the 20th September.\nCLUB AND SOCIEEfSECRETARIES, IF THEY WISH TO LIT\nTHE FRESHER (AND EVEN PRESENT STUDENTS) KNOW WHAT THE\nCLUB OR SOCIETY HAS DCME DURING THE PAST YEAR, SHOULD\nSEND THEIR REPORTS TO FELIX BEFORE gOTH SEPTEMBER. 1\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT\n\n"

The President of\nthe club, Cliff James, presented Prof. Head with\nan inscribed silver tankard.\nProfessor Head said, in thanking the club, that\nwhen he left Liverpool University he was presented with a \"rather more humble\" beer mug. he then\nproposed \"Read's Law\" which postulates that every\nretiring professor of geology should be presented\nwith a beer mug.\nBefore the dinner Professor Head gave a lecture\non \"Geologistology, 1908 - 1955.\" - a survey of\ngeologists that he had met in that time, he mentioned also that he was often mistaken for Sir Hubert Head, the art critic, and on that account\nhe had almost been presented with an honorary degree under the wrong name, and had almost been refused a visa to the U.S.A. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nChelsea Physic\nGarden.\n2?rd May, 1955.\nDear Pete,\nFelix issued a challenge last week to the\nasking for news. To-day I would like to report from\nthe Botany Department:Pen Diving Attempt at Chelsea.\nSub-Aqua Biology. C'aj fl \u2022\u2022\nVolunteer Dives for Parker (51).\nCourageously taking up the challenge of fellow students to come to the aid of one J. Farthing, who had\ndropped his new Parker 5\n\"\n! pen in the lake at Chelsea\nPhysic Garden, T. Swinburne retreated to the lecture\n' room to gather his equipment which he providentially\nhad with him. Five minutes later emerging from his\nchanging room in the library, he was given a great ovation by the excited crowd.\nA look of anguish crossed his face as he was low-were d into the green y black waters teeming with wild\nlife at LytOO p.m., but gritting his teeth he manfully\ncarried on and after a bout of malarial shivering s he\nbegan operations, ignoring the taunts of the crowd, and\nin particular those of a knowing gentleman :-\"Are you on the bottom?\" (Swinburne with head, shoulders and chest out of water) \"You've got a job on there,\neh?\"\n\"Smells a bit, do an it?\"\nAt -V. J5, after over a hundredweight of rank smelling\nblack debris had been dredged, the attempt was given up\nand the tired diver retired to a hot bath in the Curator's house*\nFive minutes later, M, Kelly amidst cheers held aloft the pen which was found near the roots of Calt ha\nPalustris.\nThe entertainment was finished off with a celebration tea given by Df. Pratt.\nA proposal that under-water biology should form part\nof future courses was quickly quashed by the frigid Swinburne*\nTours sincerely,\nBasher.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX3 Fe it x THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nEDITOR-- P.A.E. SOUTHGATE Circulation 1200\n\"The time has come\", the walrus said, \"to talk\nof many things\". This issue of FELIX marks the end\nof another College year; a3 'ear that has \"been singularly unique. looking back, it seems to me only\nyesterday when, in company with many of my\ncontemporaries* I met old. friends on the first day\nof the Christmas term. The year flowed on ir re voc ably; after the Freshers' Days where those same\ngentlemen gazed awestruck at their first glimpse of\npseudo-University life, came the celebrations of November 5th. Guido Fawkes was very much in abeyance\nto Senate House, a Senate House which up to then had\nseemed only a distant body of octo gene ri an s; an iron\nhand in a velvet glove.\nI think it is possible now to assess the justice\nof their edict. \"When a student is arrested while\ntaking part in an official, or unofficial, Rag, we\nwill suspend him (or her) from the pursuance of further education at the College which he (or she) at t ends\", said the Senate in a leaflet issued to every\nperson at every college in the University.\nIn assessing, we must bear in mind two points:\n1* That the word arrest means arrest and not con-vict ion.2. That when the Police make arrests at a Student Hag,\nthey, as the Statisticians say \"take a random sample\".\nTo be fair, they have no other choice.\nIt seems to me that the first point contravenes\nthe foundations of British Justice: every man is innocent before he is proved guilty. And an innocent man\nis not punished.\nIpso facto - Senate justice is not British Justice.\nThe second point brings to mind a case which was\nbefore the Magistrates after the Rag of November 5th. An elderly lady, in Piccadilly, was arrested, and found\nguilty of the heinous crime of being there on the 5th. She wished to appeal. The Magistrate told her that it would be cheaper to pay the fine. I suppose that the\n3a me holds for students in the Magistrate's Court under\nsimilar circumstances. Forsake all hope, 0 ye that\nenter I DISHONESTY\nAmong the highlights of this year were the three\nCarnivals. For those of you who have not been to a Carnival, let me advise you to go to one next year.\nIf you drink a little too much, one of the many Hostel\ninmates will be sure to take compassion on you, never\nfear. But there are some people in I.C. who do not\nhave this spirit ofc amara d erI e They go to Carnivals\nwithout paying a brass farthing. I thought that the\nlast Carnival saw an end to this dishonesty, but I was\nmistaken. Someone stole the FELIX money in the Royal\nCollege of Science. If that person reads FELIX, probably without paying for it, let me say this to him:\nWe are un sub sidi sed. We just keep our financial heads\nabove water. We do not appreciate any kind of thi ev ing, and certainly not this kind.\nSUBSCRIBING\nIn our last issue you read how Frank Irving and\nLome Welsh created a British native reo or d. We are\njustly proud of that achievement. In the Freshers'\nissue we hope to be able to include news of Imperial\nCollege which is truly international news: about\nwhich we will be even prouder.\nIf you are not coming back next year, and you\nwould like to hear from the College, why don't you\nsend a subscription to FELIX for the ,\n55-*56? It\ncosts six shillings, post free. Whilst on the subject of subscriptions, have YOU donated anything to the\nRODERIC HILL MEMORIAL? Sir Roderic Hill* as Rector\nof the College, did a fine job, and we have reason to\nbe thankful to him. Show your appreciation: give as\nmuch as you can, if only the price of ten cigarettes.\nTHE FELIX BOARD\nMost of our readers know little about the production staff. Those who have been along on Sundays to\nsee them in action leave with the impression that it's a wonder if the paper is finished in time. One of\nour recent lady typists was heard to remark \"This isn't the way to run a newspaper\". I might add that she\nonly typed on one occasion; who knows, she probably\ntypes for Sennet now i FELIX is run on newspaper lines, with a sports\neditor, a features editor, a production editor, a coming events editor and a willing team whose keenness\nleads them to make news so that they can print it. John Scott Seeley, stout editor-emeritus; restrains\nme in my more irresponsible moments with good pd vio e and an attractive typist.\nSON'S COLUMN \u2022V BY THE TIMS THAT YOU READ THIS, the\nTraction Engine, painted in the correct\ncolours by those hard working artists, p.E.

A coach\nleaves I.C. on Saturday morning to visit the Rally. The Mines' engine is entered\nfor a zig-zag obstacle race and a tilting the bucket contest.\nMORE NEWS OF THE FIRE-ENGINE; The H.C. S. hope to have\na191645 h.p. fire engine at Morphy Day next year.\nIt has a ladder, bell,a four cylinder engine with a crash gear-box, but Guildsmen and Miners will be\nrelieved to hear that it has no pumps. These could\nhave- been used to fill the traction engine boiler.\n\u2022VTHIRD YEAR CIVILE visited the Forest Research Lab.\nThey obtained two excellent specimens (2'6\"xl'3\"x6\"). Before they left the coach was searched and the\ntrophies removed - which goes to show th af 'you still can't get the wood.\"\n'\u00a7'.\ncontinued page 5 col IWE QUOTE THE TIMES - A member of the staff has sent\nus a cutting from the\"Times\".unfortunately undated,\nbut we think about four weeks old. The \" architectural correspondent \" says:\n\"There is a lao a drawing of the first block .\n... of the rebuilding scheme for the Imperial College\nof Science - itself a harmless enough structure...\"\nJ.'! That's what he thinks.\n\"....But when regarded as a pattern of the sort of\nbuilding that may cover the present imperial In st it ute site and the ground beyond it up to the Albert\nhall, provokes at least two questions: first whether\nthe picturesque Imperial Institute skyline must re all disappear, and secondly whether, if so, some attempt\ncannot be made to lay out this important site with\nan eye to the traditional South Kensington character.\"\nA POKE BONNET OF OFFICE FOR PADDY:- Although R.C.S. prefer a man as President, Mis3 paddy Clarke was\nelected to the post of Vice-President by a good mar-gin. It was decided at the not very well attended\nUnion meeting that she should wear a poke bonnet in R.C.S. colours as a mark of her office. Before any\nmore uncomfortable adornments could be officially inflicted upon her, the malevolence of those present\nwas diverted by an old-fashioned brown-bag gers tea\nparty by Chem.I. One pair of bags was brought back,\nthe sortie having failed to yield more because of\nthe presence of a certain member of staff.\nTHE I.C. TURF-FOLLOWING FRATERNITY are laughing at\nW.S.
