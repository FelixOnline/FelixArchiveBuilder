    "content": "22 Music 2 October 1998\nDELAKOTA\nPsyence Fiction * * * V2i rst ly you have to say that this album is\nchilled....with an adequate helping of bluesy\nfunk thrown in for good measure.\nThey've got a name which would lead the uninitiated to assume they're part of some US scene but they\nactually hail from tng land. Their influences tend to lie\nquite heavily with US blues but there are helpings of\nBritish baggy cool that still don't sound outdated even\nnow. The Charlatans playing only groove laden numbers\nwould be a pretty close description.\nThe opening track C 'mon Cincinnati exudes 70s American cool and contains an intensely catchy looping guitar line with an equally laid back vocal, 'C 'mon\nman....' sampled over the top. This track was released\nover the summer and if you missed it you should seriously think about giving it a listen on this album when\nyou can. The other single off the album is a stark con-tra st. The Rock is ambient and bluesy at the same time\nwith its cascading guitar line cycling over the simple\nmelody and yes yet again it is mellow and laid back. However even though the album is laid back to the\nextreme it does not bore, instead it sends you on a grooved out journey.\nOne of the few tracks that actually lets the album\ndown is Too Tough, with the whole groove effect taken\na step too far, leading it past any sense of tune fulness and into a grinding dreary m ish mash of noise. At\ntimes you could scar i ly mistake parts of songs for Reef\nbut thankfully these lapses don't tend to last very long\nand you're soon graced with more top quality mean-de rings in 90s blues. It's a bit of a coincidence that two\nblues based bands have come to the fore this summer,\nnamely Delakota and Gomez (yes the one who won the\nMercury Music Prize, and most people still can't understand how and why). Dclakota are Gomez's more energetic brothers and they don't sing with intensely\nirritating smoker's growls.\nGospel influences arc evident on 555, while Slcaly\nstarts off with a Black Grape type of riff (almost Reef like!)\nand some cheesy s cart chin' thrown in and ambles into\na grooved out instrumental. The whole attitude of\ndon't give af\"k that runs through the entire album is\nsummed up in the acoustic strum along Hook Line And\nSinkerwbctc they sing 'Sing a simple song until something complicated comes along' and guess what something complicated never comes along in the life of\nDelakota. H Jason\nFUTURE LOOP FOUNDATION\nConditions For Living\nFUTURE LOOP FOUNDATION eoN CB WH S Fcw uw iw \u2022 f you want the best underground music, you can'tI do much better than Planet Dog. They seem to\nI have an unnerving habit of only backing good\nartists and good music, and Future Loop Foundation's second album is no exception. If you've ever listened\nto drum 'n' bass in a club and thought \"this style's good, but where can you go with it?\" then Mark\nBarrott may have the answer.\nThe ten-minute title track starts you off with a traditional drum 'n' bass beat, the kind that starts fingers\nand toes tapping, before transforming into the slower\nand more industrial sound of Remote Viewing V\\a the\none minute ambience of 33:45. Several tracks on this\nalbum are slow and moody, noticeably Exit Rush and\nPraha.\nIt doesn't last for long, however, as more attacking\nbeats can be found in Karma and Conditions For living.\nBetween these ambient and dance tracks there are a couple of really innovative tunes. Omerta combines\nstrings, gentle vocals and a range samples, producing\nII minutes of great ambient drum 'n' bass. Towards the\nend it gathers momentum and bass before moving on\nto the 150bpm beats of Year hex.\nThe end of Exit Rush, signalled by seagulls and a distinct mellowing out of the album, brings on the imaginative Moog Rd. This tune really is the stuff of club chill\nout rooms spent lying on a cushion staring at the UV\nlights. It is relaxing yet uplifting, fast but somehow still\nchilled, and has great little tunes that you will want to\nskip back to on your CD player.\nSo are there any reasons you shouldn't buy this\nalbum? Well, yes. Firstly, you have to like drum 'n' bass\nto like tutu rc Loop lou nd ation. If you fancy something\na bit different but aren't really in to harsh beats over\n130bpm, forget it. Having said lh at, this album has a lot of variation and takes the music beyond its original\nclub setting. Definitely an album for chilling, with maybe\nthe occasional dance across the carpet thrown In.D Ed\n\n"

    "content": "News 2 October 1998\nBeware Meningitis\nMeningitis epidemics have struck a number of universities over the last few years. Dr. Irene\nWelnreb, of Imperial College Health Centre, outlines the possible risks facing IC students\nThat start of the academic year Is a time\nthat heralds a range of emotions for the\nuniversity community. Unfortunately it\nalso heralds one of the optimum times\nfor outbreaks of meningitis.\nMeningitis means inflammation of\nthe meninges, the outer linings of the\nbrain and spina[cord. This inflammation\nis usually caused by Infection: Both bacteria and viruses can cause meningitis,\nbut it is the bacteria which are more\ndeadly. Unfortunately in the early stages\nof the disease it is not easy to distinguish\nwhich of the two is the causal agent.\nEarly symptoms mimic flu or a hangover and may progress to severe\nheadaches, vomiting, a very high tem-per at ure,a dislike of bright lights, neck\nstiffness, joint pains, drowsiness and con-fusion. Bacterial meningitis is characterised by the appearance of a distinctive\nrash that does not fade on pressure.\nThis may initially resemble small pinpricks before progressing to larger areas\nof 'bruising'. The 'tumbler test' is useful\nIn observing this symptom; If a glass is\nfirmly pressed against the affected skin,\nand the rash is still visible through the\nglass, medical help must be sought\nimmediately. Anyone concerned about\nthemselves or their friends should contact IC's Health Centre or their own GP\n- look out for your mate.\nThe fatalities at other universities in\nprevious years have been caused by a complication called Meningococcal Septicaemia, a disease 15 to 19 year olds are\nparticularly at risk from. The peak time\nof year for occurrences is at the beginning of the winter.\nTransmission of bacterial meningitis\nrequires close physical contact, as the\nbacteria cannot survive outside the body\nfor very long. In most people the bacteria will not invade the blood stream and\nlittle disease develops, but in a small\nfraction of cases invasive disease will\nfollow after infection.\nEvery student in Imperial College\nhalls of residence, except Clayponds,\nhas received a leaflet on meningitis in\ntheir medical registration pack. On each\nnoticeboard in each hall bedroom Is a 'credit card' sized description of the\nsymptoms. Be aware. Be vigilant.

Unsurprisingly many of\nthe building projects are taking longer\nthan anticipated, but it looks like most of\nthe essential work will be finished by the\nfirst Monday of term. The new Biomedical Sciences (BMS) Building will\nopen at the start of term, although\nexactly what state of readiness it will be\nIn remains unclear-. Rumours of dark\nrooms constructed next to windows, ceilings built too low for electron microscopes and suchlike have been\ncirculating for much of the summer. The\nreal test will come in the next week,\nwhen teaching begins in the new build-ing; hopefully the paint in the lecture theatres will be dry by then.\nThe Junior Common Room (JCR) will\nalso open in time for registration on\nMonday, as will the snack bar QTs. ICU's part of the new JCR, however, will not be\nready for another two weeks.

IC Cricketers\nStump Royal\nHolloway\nThe farcical challenge by Royal Holloway\nto Imperial's victory In the University of\nLondon League Cricket Cup has finally\nbeen settled In Imperial's favour at a ULU committee meeting. The original\ndispute centred around one of Imperial's players, Imran Khan, who was in the\nfirst team. Mr Khan is a medical student,\nwhich led to Royal Holloway complaining that he was not eligible to play for\nImperial College teams, as Imperial College School of Medicine was not recognised as part of Imperial College by ULU\nuntil this term (see Felix 1119).\nThe Issue was laid to rest when\nCharlie Joynt, then Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies), produced Mr Khan's IC swipe card at the meeting. This was\nenough to persuade those present that\nImperial had not broken ULU regulations\nand should be allowed to keep the cup.\nIronically the first team beat Royal Holloway by four wickets, while Mr Khan\nscored just one run, making the debate\nseem somewhat academic. Let's hope\nImperial's cricketers can repeat that performance in this year's competition.\nInside the\nFreshers'\nGuide\nThought for the day 14\nFreshers'Week Ents 15\nFreshers'Fair Maps 16\nAli Campbell\nGetting a job\n18\n19\nThe Voice of Reason 20\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB Internal tel: 58072 Internal fax: 48072 External tel & fax: 0171 594 8072 URL: www.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix E mail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted at MCP Litho Limited.

    "content": "20 Column 2 October 1998\nBusiness as usual on site\nReports of my death are greatly exaggerated. You (the denizens of Sherfield)\nthought I'd gone. Fat chance. They still\nhaven't found a decent columnist, which\nmeans you're stuck with me, though this\nyear will be my last. I say this now,\nbecause I feel I owe it to my dear friend\nLynda Davies, the redoubtable Head of\nPR. She was filled\nwith emotion, I am\ntold, when she\nfound out that I was staying here to\ndo a PhD, so it only\nseems fair to break\nthe news early. So,\nin the words of a famous philosopher, nice to see\nyou, to see you nice. Welcome back, or\nwelcome for the first time. Though people come and go, this year is different,\nsince we now have the new School of\nMedicine. Given the warmth of feeling\nthat exists between St Mary's and the\nSouth Ken campus, we can be assured\nof interesting times, particularly on Friday\nnights in the Union, though I suspect that\nsome of our medical friends will visit\nsaid establishment as often as Mary\nWhitehouse frequents the Raymond\nRevue Bar.\nSince my middle name is Peter and\nnot Originality, I shall start by offering the\ntraditional advice and wisdom to you, the\nfresher s. First and foremost, those funny\nred police cars. If you are new to London,\nyou may well be confused. No need. All\nthe policeman in such vehicles helpfully\nhave the same name, which is Sir. Lovely\nblok es, but not the best audience for student humour. Secondly, you may have\nheard - and your parents feared - that universities are a hotbed of sexual activity,\nwhere a bit of slap and tickle is even\nmore assured than in the Oval Office.\nImperial, on the other hand, adopts the\nmoral high ground, believing that sex\nbefore graduation is a sin. In the exceptionally unlikely event that you should\nneed the requisite protection, bear in\nmind that the machines on campus have\nnot yet been converted to decimal\ncoinage. Finally, we come to alcohol.\nIgnoring for the moment the inevitable\nrubbish someone will spout this week on\nthe subject of 'institutional is ed' drinking,\nit is better to consider quality, not quan-t it y. Imperial offers two drinking venues,\nthe Union and Southside. The former is\na great place to spend a drunken\nevening, especially in Freshers' Week,\nsipping vodka or Jack Daniels. If you're\ndying for a good pint however, avoid it\nlike the plague and head to Southside\nBar in Princes Gardens. It gives me no\npleasure to bemoan the state of the\nUnion's beer for the umpteenth time, but\nwhile it stays like it is, I shall not sleep\nfrom mental fight etc. All in all, you have\nchosen well. Imperial is a fantastic\nplace to be a stu-dent, if a little on\nthe pricey side. Tha\nstatement, as you wi\nSimon Baker\n'Imperial... adopts the\nmoral high ground,\nbelieving that sex\nbefore graduation is a sin.\ning work near the library. All the lovely\nblock paving and car park spaces have\nbeen removed, a path has been laid\nand what, to the\nuntrained eye, looks\nlike a flower bed is\nunder construction. Of\ncourse, it couldn't pos-'...not even Imperial\nwould sacrifice a row\nof parking for a few\ndaffodils...'\nVoice of Reason\nsoon learn, is on a par\nwith 'Imelda Marcos\nhad quite a few\nshoes.'\nThis year is also\nnotable because\nit marks the\nintroduction of\ntuition fees.\nLambasted by the NUS, who said that it\nwould lead to a massive drop in university applications (it didn't), it will be interesting to see if students' minds are more\nfocussed on the end result of their three\nyears here. Without wishing to sound\nlike an old g it, this is no bad thing, since\nthe job market is no bowl of cherries.\nThat said, there are two ways to get a good degree from Imperial. The first is to\nspend all your time locked in your room\nreading every book ever published on or\naround your course. By this method, of\ncourse, any fool could get a First in any-thing, but be rendered totally unemployable. The challenge is to come out\nwith the right result, but have a bloody\ngood look at this thing called life. Having\nbeen there and done that, I would recommend the latter strategy. As for the\nwhole debt thing, keep it in perspective. A regular table at the Savoy Grill is\nprobably off the cards, but remember\nthat the banks will believe the most ludicrous old guff given in support of an\noverdraft application. Christ, they even\ngave me one.\nLast year, at the behest of the then\neditor, I gave a beginner's guide to the\ninstitutions of Imperial, explaining places\nsuch as the Sherfield Building, the administrative centre. You may be thinking that\nis not the correct way to spell Sheffield,\nor possibly 'why the Hell is he talking\nabout a building full of paper pushers?'\nAh, the naivet e of youth. For this building possesses dark forces from which\nyou will not escape, as any old lag will tell\nyou. The latest edict from on high in the\nEstates Division concerns a bit of build-si bly be a flower bed,\nbecause not even\nImperial would sacrifice a row of parking\nfor a few daffodils,\nwhen the money\ncould have\nbeen better\nspent on re-re-re-refurbishing170 Queens Gate. Whatever the\nfinal outcome, this is a monstrous waste\nof money, when one considers the state\nof some of the Halls, for example Fisher\nHall. I had the pleasure of residing there\nover the summer because the Dorchester was full. The state of repair is poor\nto say the least, but before the Suite\nFive dwellers write in, let me explain. I acknowledge that everything cannot be\ndone immediately, and where the\nbuilders have been sent in, the results are\nimpressive. However, it is both annoying\nand depressing\nwhen one sees\nthe manner in\nwhich maintenance has been\ncarried out in\nFisher and, I pre-s ume, elsewhere.\nWalls touched up\nwith paint that even Stevie Wonder\nwould consider a poor match, poly fill a slapped in the general direction of cracks\nand a disgraceful mess left wherever the\n'tradesmen' have been. When money is\nspent, it Is given to contractors who are\nwoefully incompetent by a department\nthat clearly couldn't care less about buildings which, if they play their cards right,\nthey will never have the misfortune to\nvisit. Looks like this year will be business\nas usual.\nBMS \"CAFE\"\nThe BMS\" CAFE\" is situated on the\nground floor of the new BMS Building,\nwith 120 seats and facing the Queen's lawn.\nOpen from 8.30am to 5.30pm Mon - Fri\nThere are assorted products e.g. filled Panini's, French\npat is series and New Covent Garden soups as well as\nsandwiches and drinks.\nLook out for the opening of the\nBMS \"CAFE\".\nPresent this article during the first week of term and\nexchange it for a FREE can of coke with any purchase.\n\n"

    "content": "2 October 1998 Music 23\nMANSUN\n\u2022 f you want the definition of a con-Ice pt album then go no further, just\nI give Six a listen and all your questions will be answered. The first track,\nthe title track, is a bizarre medley of\nthree songs rolled into one, in a way\nsimilar to Radiohcad's immense epic\nParanoid Android but of a distinctly third\nrale quality.\nThe entire album is full of purposely\ndisch or dant and disjointed bits of music\nthat sound like an attempt at impersonating the Cardiacs but still trying to\nremain accessible. They have moved\naway from their previous debut album,\nAttack of the Grey Lantern, (also a concept album) which contained a few easy\nto spot singles while this one has about\ntwo in total. It won't come as a surprise\nthat these tracks are the two that have\nbeen released so far. Legacy and Being\na Girl.\nAnother quirk of the album Is that\nman sun have decided to make it in two\nparts which are joined together with an\ninterlude. Why? is the first question you\nask yourself, maybe they're showing off\ntheir originality hmmm. There is a whole mix of st lyes playing around, ranging from di chord ant punk in Cancer and\nthe use of a harpsichord on the interlude\ntrack with an opera singer drafted in to\nsing over the top.\nThe whole mood is pretty bleak and\ni the album's depressive ness really shows\non Negative, which is all about looking\ndownwards and 'seeing negative', while\nanother track is titled Anti Everything.\nNeed I go on? Although Six is a few\nleaps away from Attack of... the quirky\nmeaningless lyrics are still present and\nthe straight up pop of songs like Taxloss\nhas been removed from their song base.\n80s goth (The Mission and The Cure)\ninfluence them on songs such as Special/Blown It while they take a trip into\npsychedelia on Television.\nIf you're expecting the same as\nAttack of., then don't, and don't be\ndeceived by Legacy(\\hc first single from\nSix). It doesn't sound anything like the\nrest of the album....let me warn you now.\nThis could one of those albums that\ngrow on you after a zillion listens but the\nproblem is after about enduring three\nyou just won't have the will power to listen anymore. And I actually liked their\nfirst offering....well maybe it's the difficult\nalbum clich e that everyone talks\nabout....hmmm. H JSson\nREVIEWERS\nWANTED\nThink you're a budding John\nPeel? Would you like to\nreview some music for Felix,\nand see your words of aural\nwisdom In print? Simply drop\ninto the office, send us an\nemail on felix@ic.ac.uk, or\ncome and visit us at Freshers'\nFair. The very best part is...\nyou get to keep the CDs you\nreview! Need we say more?\nAnnie Christian - The Other Way\nAnnie Christian have the energy level of the Supernatural meet the Boo Radleys. Their music's loud, but\nseems to be turned down to just the right volume. The\nstrong lead guitar dictates the tun c of the song, having a similar chorus. It's a song that nearly everyone will\nlike, but no-one will be motivated enough to buy it.\nSheryl Crow - Favourite Mistake\nDisappointing from Crow. It starts harmlessly enough,\nbut leads to a near drone of a chorus, that fails to produce any feelings. Too slow, too small a range of\nnotes, but I'm sure it's good to sleep to.\nPuressence - Traffic Jam In Memory Lane\nThe lead singer's voice is distinctive, conjuring notes\nwith the shakes of an opera singer. They obviously have\nthe talent as a band and would probably be great live,\nbut to achieve anything they need to think about getting a decent song.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Asian Dub Foundation - Naxallte\nTin Star - Viva\nWith an electronic baseline comparable to Mission\nImpossible and a reincarnated Michael Hutchinson\nsinger you can't go that far wrong. Get FatBoy Slim in\nto make a real dance remix and you could have a club\nhit on your hands.\nMcAlmont - Honey\nLionel Richie better watch his back. McAlmont could\nquite easily steel the masses of people still pining for\nhim with this song. It may be more modern, but lacks\nthe real style (if I can use that word) that real pop/soul\nsingers posses.\nThe Beautiful South Perfect 10\nConsidering the kind of music the BS have been spouting lately, this tun c is surprisingly good. The bass is so\ngood and dare I say funky that everything else can just\nfall into place by itself. And what's the Llvis impression\nabout? Who cares I like it\nScarfo - A Year From Monday\nThis song has a definite journey. The male singer has\na very 'femme' softness to his voice and his use of\nminors through the song really adds to its atmosphere,\nbut just when you want the chorus to take off. it does\nthe predictable, easiest route. Still quite good though.\nAt last the single with that cheeky guitar tune has\ncome out (Urn...it did come out - Music td) It went\ndown a storm at the mercury awards and as a single it\ndoesn't fail to deliver. With five versions on the single\nit's worth buying even if you already have the album.\nSix By Seven - For You\nA good verse, echoed by the guitar, but an average\nsinger, who doesn't seem capable of any emotion. The\nchorus sounds like many I 've heard before, it's more a question of which band did it first. CI\nDavid H. "

    "content": "2 October 1998 Feature 9\nconsists of one knot (\"bowl inc on-thc\nbight\") positioned where you want the\nrope to hang from, and two loops of\nrope that go up from the knot with an\nangle between them of less than 45\ndegrees. These arc fixed to the bolts.\n\"Seems okay to me, you're ready to\ngo then...\"\nI nodded, picked up the remaining\ncoil of about forty metres of rope, dou-ble-checked there was a knot in the end\n(I didn't want to a bse il off the rope),\nleaned over the slit and dropped it. You\ncould hear it whistle through the air, and\nthen there was a 'thud' as the rope was\npulled taut. I leaned over to check it was\nhanging freely and then set about attaching my descender to the rope. Slowly, I cased my weight onto the newly-placed\nbolts until I was hanging off the rope.\n(The bolts held, of course.) Cautiously I inched down the rope, dropping through\nthe slit. The start was a bit tight but then\nI slowly emerged into the top of a large\nshaft. Looking down through my feet I could see nothing but empty space and\nthe rope snaking away into the dark-ness. This was big: I could make out au ally hammered into the wall of the\ncave). I then intended to trust my life to\nthis bolt while I a bse i led into the\nunknown. I stood at the bottom of a circular shaft (about 15ft wide and 25ft high) with my legs straddled across a slit\nin the floor about 6ft long and 2ft wide.\nI also had a descender (a device used to\ngo down ropes at a controlled speed)\nattached to a rope in case I slipped and\nfell.\n\"The next step is to decide where to\nput the bolts. They need to be high, otherwise it proves too awkward for the\nnext person to get his descender on the\nrope. The rock has to be strong, otherwise the bolt may pop... you don't want\nthat, the surface needs to be flat, and the\nbolt must go in exactly perpendicular to\nthe surface, otherwise it won't be able to\ngo in fully, and you won't be able to tie\nthe rope to it. Finally, and this is most\nimportant of all, the rope must hang\nfreely from the bolt otherwise it will rub\non the rock and snap. Happy? So you\nknow what to do. You'll have to excuse\nme now, I need to go and have a shit.\nDon't worry, it's not that difficult, and anyway I 'll be right behind you!\"\nBefore I started hammering, I used\nthe back-up light on my helmet to illuminate the slit beneath my feet. I could\nsee it was about four feet long, going\ndown vertically. After that It seemed to\nopen up, but the beam of light failed to\npierce the darkness beyond. I was quite\nnervous and had that sort-of-empty sensation in my stomach. I knew that once\nthe bolts were in and the rope was tied\nI was going to have to go down; the\nanticipation of what I might find was\nalmost frightening. Hammering a bolt\ninto solid rock is quite tiring and whilst\nresting I knocked a rock down the slit. It\nclattered down the hole and then there\nwas silence for 1 second... 2 seconds...\n3 seconds ..bang! How deep was it?\nForty-five metres, maybe? I carried on\nbolting, while trying not to think about it\ntoo much. In the meantime my partner,\nthe much more experienced half of our\nduo, was just finishing his business and\nhiding the evidence in a plastic bag.\n\"Have you finished yet?\"\n\"Nearly.\" I replied, as I finished attaching the rope to the bolts. He came over\nand checked my rigging and the bolts;\nthe set-up was now a classic Y hang. This\nfloor, maybe forty metres down, but my\nhelmet light seemed suddenly feeble.\n\"It's quite big!\" I yelled excitedly to my\npartner. \"I am going on down...\"\nI descended slowly for another ten\nfeet, then stopped. I suddenly felt a lot\nsmaller and a lot less confident as I stared\ninto the dark pit beneath my feet. It\ndawned on me that the 'floor' I had\nseen was a mere ledge, perhaps only\n10ft wide, and certainly not the bottom.\nAt the ledge the pit was oblong in shape,\nat least fifteen metres long and ten\nmetres wide. \"Jesus Christ, it's huge and\nit .goes on down,\" I shouted. I swung\naround, looking for a rock to pick off the\nwalls. I then dropped it into the black\nhole by the ledge; it fell for three or four\nseconds, indicating a pitch between sixty\nand eighty metres deep.\nYou don't become an experienced\nexpedition cave r by caving a lot; you just\nhave to do a first expedition, and that's the big step. If you are interested (and it\nis definitely worthwhile) get in contact\nwith the Caving Club, or come and see\nus at fresher s' fair.\n\n"

The\nheavy rain last weekend meant that the\nThames was still high on Monday after-noon; an afternoon's white water is far\nmore fun than one in the lab.\nOur usual play spot is Hurley weir on\nthe Thames. Some great white water\nblasts through the sluice gates and forms\nsome big surf waves, so that talented\nboaters can pull the full range of spins,\ncartwheels, re ten does, bandits and other\ncunning stunts, and the not-so-talented\ncan get their earwax hydraulically\nremoved.\n\"Useless\" Rob made a typical start by\nleaving most of his kit behind at College\nbut. showing an admirable determined-ness to get cold, he elected to go canoeing anyway, without the comforts of a wetsuit or dry-top. He was soon showing his true colours (hypo the r mic blue)\nas he repeatedly fell out of his boat and\nswam around the weir pool, with Instructor Garth on rescue duty. Those of us\nwho had remembered that rivers are\ncold, and brought plenty of warm gear,\nhad a great afternoon playing on the\nwaves.\nThe canoe club is one of the most\nactive outdoor clubs in College.Everyone is welcome, from the complete\nbeginner to the hardened white-water\naddict. We own a full range of boats\nand kit for members to use. and have\nseveral qualified instructors in the club.\nThroughout the year, we run trips to\nrivers around the country. We also have\nweekly pool sessions, where we can\nteach beginners in the warm tor more\ninformation, come to any pool session\n(Tuesday evenings, meet 7pm in Beit\nQuad or 7.30pm at the sports centre) or\nemail slap per s@ ic.ac.uk.\nSeems the football club had a good holiday\nStuart Cook & Andy Swift\nDear helix,\nI am writing on behalf of the ICU\nAssociation loot ball Club to thank\neveryone who helped with the successful summer football tour to the Al\nGarve, Portugal this summer. In particular we greatly appreciated the\ngenerous financial help given by the\nHarlington Trust and Imperial College\nUnion as well as the support given by\nfrank Murray, Neil O 'Shaughnessy at\nthe Union and, of course, the tireless\neffort given by the former Union\nPresident Andy Heeps.\nOn the pitch we won 2 of our 4\ngames, losing the other two games\nnarrowly 1-0 and 2-1. Credit must be\ngiven to Dan Perreria who managed to\nscore an own-goal in each of those two\ngames! Thanks also to tour captain\nDarren Boland who did a sterling job.

It's Just not been our week...\nAnother great\nsummer for ICU\nGliding Club\nAndy Holmes\nThe gliding club continued flying all\nthrough the summer break again this\nyear and, despite poor weather, we had\nloads of fun and some great flying.\nThe summer started with a week-long course at Lasham airfield in July, during which two of our pilots flew solo for\nthe first time. Only the thought of how\nexpensive the round would be with ten\npeople on the course, and two in st ruc tors, reduced the size of their grins!\nAlthough there were reasonable\nthermals in July, the weather improved\ngreatly in August and, on Saturday 15th, club captain Andy Holmes flew a350 kilometre cross-country with an instructor\nin 496 - the club's training glider. This is\nthe longest distance flown by this glider\nin 1998, and the flight took them from\nLasham airfield (near Basingstoke) to\nShobdon airfield (near Hereford) and\nback to Lasham in 4 hours 30 minutes.\nThe flight started with a tow to 2000 feet\nbehind a powerful Piper Pawnee tow-plane,\nrelease\nover\nLasham,\nand circling in\nthermal lift\nto climb\nhigh (up to\nover 4000\nfeet at some points). They then flew in\na straight line towards the intended goal,\ngradually losing height until they had to\nclimb in a thermal once more.\nLater in August, Andy attended a cross-country course at Lasham airfield,\nin order to be cleared to fly away from\nthe airfield by himself. During the\ncourse, Andy completed his Silver badge\nwith a first solo cross-country flight from\nLasham to Old Sarum airfield, near Salisbury (54 km).\nCompleting the Silver badge allowed\nAndy to enter the British Junior Gliding\nChampionships in one of the gliding\nclub's single seat gliders, 296. Although\none solo cross-country was hardly\nenough to prepare him for this competition, Andy enjoyed himself and learned\nquickly,\nand by\nthe end of\nthe week\nhe had\ncovered\n260km on\na day\nwhen a300 km task was set, and completed the 240km task on the last day of the competition.\nFor both of these flights, Andy was airborne for over six hours!\nAndy isn't the only keen pilot in the\nclub however. An cx-IC student directed\nthe competition. Another ex-student\ncame second, after having won the competition last year. IC students have also\nbeen members of the British team for\nThe competition grid on the main runway at Lasham airfield\ntu rope an and International events. ICU\nGliding Club has a long history of training people from their first flight to international level, and it seems that this\ntrend will continue. Do you want to be\npart of this success story?\nThe gliding club flies all year round,\nand offers trial flights for those who want\nto try it before they join the club. Courses\nand tours to other gliding clubs (and\nsometimes other countries!) are often\narranged. If you want to find out more\nabout a sport which allows you to travel\nlong distances, using only your newfound understanding of nature's energy,\nthen contact us. If you want to learn to\nfly at less than a tenth of the price of\npower flying, contact us. Even if you just\nwant to fly some aerobatics, please contact us. We're here to provide a cheap\nintroduction to gliding for anyone who\nwants to try it. See us at the Freshers' Fair\nor contact me on\nandrew.holmes@ic.ac.uk.\n\n"

The next\nthree or four years should be among the\nmost interesting and enjoyable in your\nlife, provided you make the most of the\nopportunities available at the College.\nThis letter aims to give you some ideas\nfor your own self-development.\nComing to university is a significant\nstep. You have more freedom, more\nindependence and more opportunities\nto do your own thing, to succeed or fail,\nthan you will have had at school. If you\ndo not make some mistakes you will\nnot have learnt anything; learning from\none's mistakes is an important part of\nexperience. Build on the experience of\nothers - take advice (it's usually free) -ignore some of it, test it out, accept or\nreject it.\nYou have already\ndemonstrated some\nplanning ability by passing 'A' levels, or their\nequivalent. How are you\ngoing to plan the next\nthree, four or more\nyears? And I'm not talking just about your academic studies: I'm talking\nabout the start of the rest\nof your life.\nWhat do you want to achieve this\nterm? Making friends is usually high on\nmost people's list. How? Join clubs and\nsocieties, attend meetings, take up a new sport, develop a new interest - any\nof these are likely to bring you into contact with like minded students. And\nthere's always the bar to prop up while\nseeking inspiration.\nBy the end of the summer term in\nyour first year\nyou are going\nto be feeling\nfinancial pressure - in other\nwords you'll\nbe broke! So\nhow about\nearning some good money in the long\nvacation. If you leave job hunting until\nthe holiday starts you may be too late. All\nthe interesting and lucrative jobs will\nhave been filled already and you will be\nlucky if the local council wants some\ngrass cutting or the garden centre needs\na spare pair of hands. It's well worthwhile doing some preliminary job hunting between Christmas and Easter. Call\nin at the IC Careers Service (Room 310, Sherfield\nBuilding) where you will\nfind information about\nVacation Training, write\nto employers with your\nCV, call in to some local\nshops and hotels and\nsee who's advertising in\nthe local press.\nHoliday jobs can be\nmost informative. Ideally they give you the\nchance to try out work or a future\nemployer in which you are interested.\nThey give you experience in job hunting,\nletter writing and interviews, as well as\na real insight into what it's like to work\nfor an employer. Some even pay quite\nwell. Jobs abroad are popular and early\napplications are essential. Start by visiting the IC Careers Service which has a good range of reference books and\naddresses.\nAt the\nstart of the\nsecond year\nyou will raise\nyour sights\nhigher. Now\nis the time to\ntest your skills in organising something\n- a social evening for your department,\nlooking after the finances of a society or\nbeing fixtures secretary of your team.\n\"That sounds too much like hard work!\"\nI hear you say. Yes, it does take some\neffort on your part but generally speaking the more effort you put into something the more enjoyment you will get\nout of it.\nCommittee work is\nexcellent preparation for\nlife after College. You\nlearn to set agendas, run\nmeetings, agree actions,\npersuade other students\nto do things, work within\nbudgets and end up with\na successful event - a party, a visit, a play or a newspaper; think how\nmuch effort went into producing this\nedition of Felix. [You can stop that right\nthere - Ed]\nYou should start thinking seriously\nabout your future career before the end\nof the second year. Even if you haven'ta clue what you want to do, that's no\nexcuse for delaying finding out about the\npossibilities. You are surrounded with\nsources of information - friends, family,\ntutors, careers advisers, libraries, the\ninternet. Start looking. It may be a long\nprocess but it really is worth spending\ntime thinking about your career, then\nplanning your next weekend or holiday.\nThe IC Careers Service is a good\nstarting place. Pop in and speak to the\ninformation staff. Find out about\n'Prospect (HE)' - our computer careers\nguidance system - and all the information\nbooklets and reference files. Have a look at some of the videos, attend some\nseminars or careers, get yourself sorted\nout.\nThe Milkround is in the spring term\nof your final year. This is when employers visit campuses to interview applicants or invite you to their London\nOffices.\nChristmas vacation courses are a popular way of finding\nout about careers such\nas marketing but only a few major recruiters run\nthem and they are normally over-subscribed\nmany times.\n\"Stop! I'm only a fresher - why are you\ntelling me all this?\"\nI'm telling you\nbecause you need to start planning your\nlife now; don't just drift through College\nand emerge with a degree and nothing\nelse. Of course a degree is important\nand must be your first priority, but not\nyour only priority.\nIn the meantime, enjoy yourself.\nJohn Simpson\nDirector\nIC Careers Service\n'Join clubs and\nsocieties, attend\nmeetings, take up\na new sport,\ndevelop a new\ninterest...'\nJohn Simpson, Director of Imperial\nCollege's Careers Service, welcomes\nyou to Imperial and reminds us why\nwe are really here...\n'...don't just drift\nthrough College\nand emerge with\na degree and\nnothing else...'\nGradunet give their opinion on how to run your student days and, surprise surprise, they can help\nAs a certain cockney charmer might have\nsaid \"not a lot of people know this\", but\nthe first and second year are as important\nto your job prospects as the third year.\nWhen writing your CVyou will soon\nrealise that a vivid imagination is the\nmost important weapon in your job hunting armour y. \"Fixing the lock on the\nbike shed\" becomes \"I was secretary of\nthe Mountain Bike Club\" whilst \"going to\nthe cinema\" makes you \"vice-president\nof the student film society\".\nThe average student recruiter goes\nthrough thousands of CVs and application forms and soon learns to decipher\nthese coded messages. You need to\nlearn how to pierce even the most experienced recruiter's cynicism, and land\nthe job of a lifetime.\nFirst Term\nJoin the societies that are really of\ninterest to you. Join asco ie ty that you will\nstill want to a member of in three years'\ntime, because by then you will have\nachieved responsibility and your CV will\nshow determination and staying power.\nSecond Term\nIt's time to turn your attention to the\nsummer. It makes sense to take advantage of those long summer holidays and\ntravel the world. It's time to show your\nplanning and execution skills. Save up,\nget a part time job to earn enough money\nto go somewhere. As a student there are\nloads of great flight deals, and there are\nplenty of places where a small income\ngoes a long way. Work overseas can give\nyou a small income and plenty of new\nfriends. Even if it goes horribly wrong you\ncan show your future employer what brilliant Improvisation skills you have.\nThird Term\nNow that you have the summer all\nplanned you can relax and concentrate\non your academic work.

How about creating your own PlayStation game? Sounds\n' impossible? Not with a Net Yaroze!\nPut simply, the Net Yaroze is a programmable PlayStation - the bedroom\ncoder's dream come true. Whilst most of us can't afford thousands of pounds for\na development kit, the Yaroze retails for a mere \u00a3230. You will need something to plug\nit into, however. A telly and a PC are required,\nand some experience of 'C programming is\ncertainly useful too. The 'Net' bit of the Net\nYaroze is supplied by an exclusive web site\nand newsgroups. Yaroze members have a free web page to show off their games, or to\nhelp other Yarozers (as they are fondly\nknown).\nThe main restriction of the Net Yaroze is\nthat there is no access to the CD, so all of a game's data and code must be squeezed into\nthe teeny 2Mb of memory in the PlayStation\n(less than In most graphics cards these days,\nbut that's progress for you). Whilst the supplied software is adequate, those who prefer\na fancy integrated development environment\ncan pick up a copy of CodeWarrior for an extra\n\u00a390.\nMembers who want to show off their\ngames can enter the 'fame game' com pet i tion. Winners' games are published on the\nOfficial PlayStation Magazine demo disc, and\nthey get twenty copies to give to friends.\nThere's also a Net Yaroze category in the\nGames Developer's UK competition, with a top prize of \u00a35000.\nBut most people will get the Net Yarozc\nto try their hand at game programming. Several Yaroze owners have now gone on to get\njobs in the games industry. Scott Evans, now\nworking at top UK developers Codemasters,\nsaid \"The people who buy a Net Yaroze get\nto learn how to program one of the best\ngames consoles around today. If you can put\non your OV you have got PlayStation programming experience you will have a greater\nchance of getting interviews.\"\nUniversities and Colleges are now using\nthe Yaroze as a basis for courses in computer\ngames. Middlesex University even offers a three day introduction to Net Yaroze pro-g ramming. As for myself. I bought my Yaroze last\nsummer, and the experience of programming a real console was an invaluable aid in\ngetting my job at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Of course, the degree in Computing from Imperial probably had something\nto do with it too!\nfor full details, see the Net Yaroze\nwebsite at http://www.s cee. sony.co.uk/\nyar ln fo/l n dex. html.\nTo celebrate the recent price drop of the\nNet Yaroze to \u00a3230, we've got an exclusive\nNet Yaroze t sh lrt to give away. Simply email\nfelix@ic.ac.uk with the answer to the following question: What is the prize in the Net\nYaroze Fame Game competition?

They are dull, dull, dull.\nUsually, with little help, you are left to assemble a team which will struggle not to\nlose its first 20 games. The current king, Championship Manager 2, fits this rule per-fec t ly. So perhaps World Football Manager is the game to drag this genre into the\n90's and actually provide us less fanatical footballers something fun to play with.\nSo we start with the obligatory big name on the cover. Big Fat Ron's seal of\napproval isn't the best of adverts for football, either on sex appeal or football credibility stakes - one league, one FA Cup and lots of near-relegation misses doesn't really inspire confidence. At least it's better than having Alex Ferguson's scowling\nmug. If Ron puts you off your dinner you can always hide the CD case, and luckily the game is much prettier by far. The graphics are clear and while you might not\nget 30 frames per second with polygons flying about the screen, at least you can\nnavigate between any two screens with a minimum of mouse clicks (say bye to hundreds of menus). You still have your train-spotting statistics and your hundreds of\noptions to play with: scouts,\nsquads, training programs,\nman to man marking - possibly\nenough to keep you occupied\nfor a week between the simulated games (if you really don't have a life outside your darkened den). Those with a life\nmight find the two best features to be the interactive help\nand the fact that the footballers\nactually seem to have a life off\nEnough options to please even Stato the field. Midfielders with tendencies to put their feet\nthrough plate glass windows and fight other players' sisters are all possibilities (hint:\ndon't buy N. Wheelan).\nSo if you like football, don't mind Ron's face and want a management game\nwith slightly more humour than Championship Manager 2, this is the one to go for.\nIf you love Championship Manager for its useful statistics, I'd advise more daylight.\nGary Smith\nVideogame top 20 chart All formats\n1 C Tekken 3 Namco/Sony PS\n2 Nt 11 World Grand Prix Nintendo N64\n3 O TOCA Touring Car Championship Psat./Codemasters PC, PS\n4 o Colin McRae Rally Codemasters PS\n5 o Premier Manager 98 Gremlin PC.

    "content": "14 Column 2 October 1998\nThought for the Day\nOpportunity Knocks\nI spent a good fifteen hours this summer doing something at which, I have\nto admit, I am quite good. This activity, for those of you who are interested,\ndid not include vomiting up my own\nbedroom wall; nor did it involve the\nrepeated consumption of pints of\nopaque ale (I have given up this particular vice, as the aforementioned act of\ndecoration was murder to clean off).\nSadly, as those of you who read my gu b bins last year will accurately have pre-dic ted, it was not an activity of a sexual\nnature either. You could not really\ndescribe it as leisure, but the fact that I was doing it at all is, I suppose, indicative\nof one of the best aspects of Imperial College.\nThe pastime in question was the\nproof-reading of a section of the shiny,\nnew (and thankfully very far from being\na black, depressing, ring-bound Gotham\nCity hulk) ICU Student Handbook. With\nno promise of personal gain, I was the\none superhero who could save an\nembarrassing violation of the print dead-line, armed only with a packet of chewing gum, a new haircut, and a thoroughly\nanal desire to see the laws of modern\nEnglish upheld. A friend in need is a sucker indeed, though, as I discovered\nafter staring at computer screens for so\nlong that my contact lenses stuck to my\neyes like cling film, or a month-old boiled\nsweet in the pocket of an old man's rain-coat.\nWhile I could sit here for hours and\nruminate on the turns of fate which left\nme clutching a pen and a section of\ncomputer printout at two in the morning,\nI feel that this would alienate busy fresh-ers, who in turn feel that they should be\nin the bar. It was upon reading this seminal version of the Handbook, though.\nthat I realised something;\nan aspect of life at Imperial\nCollege which is vital to so\nmany students, and yet\ncompletely neglected by so\nmany others - Clubs and\nSocieties.\nThe fact of the matter\nis that clubs offer not only\nan opportunity for enthusiasts and hobbyists of all\nwalks of life to satisfy their\npassions, but also provide\nan extremely open and\nuseful social structure. All\nyour friends have failed the\nyear? You've been dumped\nby your girlfriend? Spontanever heard of Technics\n1210 turntables. After two\nyears of study avoidance,\nI am more pleased with\nwhat I write than ever\nbefore (despite utter apathy from you lot, and\nworse still from certain\nFelix staff), have social\nconfidence that I only\ndreamed of when I was at\nschool, and can even do a fairly competent spin-back. I 've also gained\ndesktop publishing skills,\nwhich, let's face it, will be\nuseful on my CV.

(I did once have a look at STOIC.\nStudent Television of Imperial College,\nbut Robin Riley scared me away). This\ndoes not change the fact that I have\nmade a lot of fine friends, enjoyed writing and making a fool of myself on the\nradio on Thursday nights, and not least,\nlearned new skills. Before I came to IC I had completely neglected literary com-position, heartlessly sacrificing it for the\njoys of maths and physics, and leaving it\nbehind as just one part of the heady\nmemories of GCSE.

You\nmay remember that it was all set to be\ncrucified at Golgotha, but it seems that\nit had enough sense to shout \"I'm Brian!\"\nbefore anyone else could think of it.\nJammy sod.

    "content": "News Features 2 October 1998\nHurricane Georges Malaysia in crisis\nHurricane Georges has continued to devastate southern parts\nof the United States of America, prompting President Clinton\nto declare them disaster areas.\nby Ali Campbell\nThe winds, gusting at\nspeeds of almost 170\nmiles per hour, have\ncaused severe damage\nin Honda, Louisiana,\nAlabama and Mississippi. The President's decision to announce a state of emergency makes government funds available to finance badly-hit areas of these\nstates.\nAlthough the hurricane has now\nbeen downgraded to \"tropical storm\"\nstatus, it has already caused massive\ndamage and loss of life In regions of the\nCarribean, killing an estimated minimum\nof 300 people. Haiti and the Dominican\nRepublic have been seriously affected,\nwhere 90 percent of crops, including\nbanana plantations, have been\ndestroyed. Other areas ravaged by the\nwind and torrential rain include Cuba\nand Puerto Rico.\nGeorges is merely one of a number\nof hurricanes currently whirling across\nthe Atlantic Ocean, but seems likely to\nbe the most dangerous. The three other\ntropical weather systems - Jeanne, Ivan\nand Karl - are believed to be weakening\nas they approach civilisation. As well as the fatalities and financial damage left behind in the\nwake of such hurri-canes, there exists\ngrowing scientific evidence suggesting\nthat these storms may contribute to\nglobal warming. One theory states that\nthe winds transfer carbon dioxide from\nthe oceans into the atmosphere,\nalthough the annual quantity of gas\nreleased in this way is a mere one-twelfth\nthat introduced by humans.\nIt is also believed by some that scientific methods could be used to divert\nand break up hurricanes; suggestions\ninclude the suspension of mirrors in\nspace to warm the nearby ocean, or\ndeployment of soot into the air local to\nthe storm, which should change air temperature by absorbing infra-red radi a tion. With some research, techniques\nsuch as these might be employed to\nreduce the phenomenal damage caused\nby the likes of Georges.\nIn the past few weeks civil unrest In Malaysia has grown to the point of blood-shed, as the economic crisis In South East Asia deepens. Last year Felix featured\nseveral articles on the student-led revolution In Indonesia. Will we see a similar\nuprising In Malaysia, or Is Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad determined to\nkeep power at any cost? We examine how the stakes have been raised this\nmonth...\nby Ed Sexton\nAs with many of its neighbours,\nthe economic turmoil in\nMalaysia is affecting more than\njust share prices. Economic\nhardship has led to an increase\nin anti-government feelings,\nwhich are being released in\ndemonstrations on the streets. At the\ncentre of it all are two men; Dr Mahathir,\nMalaysia's seventy-two year old Prime\nMinister who has held power for sixteen\nyears, and Anwar Ibrahim who. until this\nmonth, had been his deputy for five\nyears.\nWhile Anwar Ibrahim has advised economic caution, spending time abroad\nattempting to reassure Western governments and thus boost confidence in\nMalaysia's economy, Dr Mahathir has\npublicly denounced foreign speculators,\nas well as restricting freedom of speech\nand assembly in his country. Whether or\nnot Western investors are to blame for\nMalaysia's troubles, Dr Mahathir was\nnever going to win favours in the international debating chambers. Meanwhile\nAnwar Ibrahim has, rightly or wrongly,\nbeen portrayed as the hero of Malaysia.\nThe Malaysian people had found a voice.\nClearly the Prime Minister and\nhis deputy were not going to\nwork together for long.\nOn 2 September Anwar Ibrahim\nwas sacked from his office by Dr\nMahathir. He immediately\nstarted leading the campaign\nagainst Dr Mahathir and his supporters,\nuntil he was arrested on 20 September.\nUnder the internal security act he can be\ndetained without a trial. This week he\nhas been charged with corruption and\nhaving 'unnatural' homosexual relations.\nMeanwhile 80 of his supporters have\nbeen arrested during an anti-govern-ment demonstration in the capital, Kuala\nLumpur, in which the police used batons\nand electric prods to break up the\ncrowds. They will be charged with \"gathering without a licence\", as there is currently a ban on organised meetings\ninvolving more than four people. Dr\nMahathir has said that Anwar Ibrahim will\nnot be released unless the demonstrations stop and calm returns to the streets,\nwhich seems unlikely given recent\nevents. The question is, who will make\nthe next move?\nOmagh - a personal view by Jean Sinclair\nUntil Saturday 15th August, the summer\nof 1998 in Northern Ireland was dominated by appa ling weather and low level\nrumblings around the marching season\nand the stand-off at Drumcree. \"Low\nlevel rumblings\" included considerable\nviolence, including the deaths of three\nyoung boys in an arson attack on their\nhome in Ballymoney, destruction of cars\nand buses and bonfires blocking streets.\nSuch events may not be low level in\nsome countries, but are considered low\nlevel by people who live here.\nSuch events are low level compared\nto what happened on Saturday 15th August 1998. At 3.10pm, a bomb\nexploded in the county town of Omagh\nin County Tyrone. It exploded in the area\nwhere people had been evacuated from\nthe Court House, in response to a coded\ntelephone bomb warning. Rapidly, casualty numbers grew: 12 dead, then 21, 26\nby next morning, 28 by mid-day, over 220\ninjured, 6 hospitals involved. Local and\nnational TV and radio changed their\nschedules. Local radio played a vital role\nin summoning emergency staff, as telephone lines were brought down and the\nmobile phone networks closed down\nexcept for designated emergency num-be rs. While the response to the death of\nPrincess Diana seemed to me to be\ntotally over the top, response here\nseemed so appropriate. Leaders of all\npolitical and religious groups made statements of sadness and condemnation.\nGovernment ministers commented,\nmany from holidays in Europe and began\nto return.\nOn a personal level: Just the day\nbefore, as part of my research into chemical incidents and health in Northern Ireland, I met with a consultant in the\nAccident and Emergency Department of\nthe Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and\na pharmacist who heads the local poisons unit, also on the RVH site. The consultant showed me the chemical\ndecontamination bay and the green chequered file entitled \"The Disaster Plan of\nthe Royal Victoria Hospital\". The plan\nends with the words \"It Is our wish that\nit may not be overly used.\" I got the\nimpression that he didn't expect the plan\nwould be implemented again in\nresponse to acts of terrorism - for a release of chemicals, multiple vehicle\npile-up, plane crash, perhaps, but not a bomb. Just over 24 hours, the RVH was\nyet again treating victims of terrorism.\nOver lunch, the pharmacist and I talked about local news and TV services.\nThe generally high standard is let down\nonly by the dire \"Town Challenge\", like\n1970s \"It's a Knockout\", which nobody\nadmits to watching. Many Northern Ireland people are \"news junkies\", actually\nwatching avidly local news broadcasts\nwhich contain important stories. Local\nnews here Is not like \"across the water\"\nin England, Wales or Scotland, where It\nis largely trivial, where members of the\npublic are invited to be \"Newsmakers\",\nperhaps to fill time, perhaps to promote\ncommunity involvement. She explained\nhow one year a planed item on storing\nchemicals and drugs safely out of children's reach was filmed and ready to be\nshown on Monday. A major event\noccurred on Monday, and Tuesday, and\nWednesday, and Thursday, By Friday, the\npoisons information staff had given up\nhope, and missed the screening.\nOn Sunday morning, I walked to\npost a letter.

Matt Hyde, President of\nULU, commented: \"We're pretty\npleased... it's obviously a major break-, hro u<3h\"_ before\nadding: It's a bit of a coup\nto have a student campaign bear\nfruit.\"\nAccording to Mr.\nHyde, London Transport had\nproved reluctant to proceed with the new discount after the\npilot scheme, and there followed consultations with many individuals and\nXY\n\u20ac> Student\n3 0 JUN1999 Un*n> mm**** ni't ml The new card, and ULU President Matt Hyde, who\nhelped negotiate the deal with London Transport\norganisations, including candidates for\nthe post of Mayor of London. He\nexplained that attempts had been made\nas far back as\nthe early 1980s to negotiate a deal of this\nnature, describing the bureaucratic process\nas \"... like\nchanging the\ndirection of a big ship.\" He\nalso voiced his\ndisappointment that the\ndeal has not\nbeen made available to mature students:\n\"I am vociferously opposed to the 18 - 24\nage limit... there is still work to do on the\nmature students' side.\"\nThe provision of this card is also welcome news for ULU itself, as some have\nfelt that the services provided to its members do not justify the \u00a391 000 per year\nmembership fee. The ULU President,\nwhen presented with this question, suggested that ULU's success in this matter\nshould be interpreted as an indication of\ngood things to come. David Hellard, President of ICU, confessed that \"...it shows\nwhat can be achieved if ULU is fully\nexploited.\" He also outlined his concern\nabout the age restrictions imposed by\nLondon Transport, drawing attention to\na \"potential massive loss\", but hopes that\nthe agreement might be rc-cv alu a ted in\nthe future.\nIn the meantime, application forms\nare available for the new card in the\nImperial College Union Office.\nThe Summer of Discontent?\nResignations over the summer holidays\nhave caused difficulties for student\norganisations throughout Imperial, leaving ICU, two Constituent College Unions\n(CCUs) and RAG without vital committee\nmembers.\nAdam Cherrington, who was elected\nas Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nlast Spring, has been forced to resign\nafter failing his Biology second year\nexams. The news was announced early\nin the summer, leaving ICU without a key\nsabbatical officer during fresher s' week\nfor the second year running.\nMeanwhile both Katy Nolan (RCSU\nPresident) and Hamish Common (C& GU\nPresident) have also stepped down for\nacademic reasons. Miss Nolan made the\ndecision after changing from a four year\nto a three year course, while Mr Common failed his second year earlier this\nmonth. In a worrying development for\nRAG. which organises several events during the Autumn term, Rob Park (RAG\nChair) has left Imperial, and is believed\nto have started a new course at QMW.\nDave Wharton, who stepped down as\nDeputy President (Finance & Services)\nElect last term, has also been forced to\nleave the college, and is now studying\nat University College.\nThus once again the first term will be\ntaken up with a round of elections. Students interested in standing for either\nCCU Presidency should contact the CCU\noffice concerned. Dave Hellard, ICU\nPresident, has set the timetable for electing a new DP(C&S): Nomination papers\nwill go up on Monday 12 October, hustings will take place between Monday 2\nand Wednesday 4 November, with voting in all departments on Monday 9 and\nContinued on pa Qc2 Fifth Sabbatical\nfor ICU\nICU Is to have a fifth sabbatical officer,\nstarting In the academic year 1999 -2000. I he new officer's self-explanatory\ntitle will be Deputy President (Education\n& Welfare). The decision brings ICU in\nline with other London colleges, many of\nwhom already have sabbatical officers\nconcerned with welfare.\nThe decision was announced by Imperial's Governing Body after a meeting in\nJuly. ICU has been trying for some time\nto get approval for the fifth sabbatical:\nDave Hellard, ICU President, explained\nthat it \"took a lot of justification... but was\nvital\". He was quick to praise his predecessor, Andy Heeps, who was responsible for much of the negotiation on\ncollege committees,- \"we take our hats\noff to Andy\". Elections for the post will\nbe held along with the other sabbatical\nelections in the Spring term.\nInside...\nNews Beware Meningitis\nOmagh - a personal view\nFeature The Caving Club\nin Slovenia\n2\n3\n8\nFreshers' Guide 13\nMusic 21\nSport 26\nComputer Games 27\nCrossword 32\n\n"

    "content": "2 October 1998 Music 21\nAlbums THE BOO RADLEYS\nKingsize\nT he Boo Radleys are one of those unlucky ex-Brit-pop bands. You know, the ones who had the\nmisfortune to be around when the music press\ncoined the term: a bracket which allowed a few bands\nto sell a lot of records in a very short time, only to fall\ninto obscurity when the genre died. In the aftermath\nof this holocaust, a few guitar groups survived, scavenging for sales amongst the rubble, pursued by fascist techno hordes brandishing sequencers, computers\nand vinyl. The 'Radlcys, stripped of the irritatingly chirp y sugar-rush that inspired Wake Up Boo!, strode boldly on\nto release an album entitled C 'mon Kids, and showed\nthat the true survivors of that fateful summer were the\nones who could adapt, evolve and innovate. Can they\ndo it again?\nNot quite. After the complex punk explosion of that\nprevious album, their new offering, Kingsizc, comes as\nsomething of a confusing disappointment. Can this be\nthe same band who created the energetic, star burst rock of Cmon Kids, What's in the Box?, and Meltin's Worm? In places, they sound for all the world like\nOasis, or, worse still. Dodgy. Bloody hell. Where is the\ncreative sparkle, the raw energy, the clashing and climactic guitar?\nBut the most irritating facet of this record is its latent\npotential - not all the songs arc middling, insubstantial\npop sludge. Martin Carr, misguided though he seems\nto be, is ultimately too good a song smith to abandon\nhis album completely. The two openers. Blue Room in\nArchway and The Old Newsstand at Hamilton Square\nare line tracks, tant a lising the listener with complex\narrangements and pop s uss. Monuments For a Dead\nCentury is beautiful, fragile and mellow; High as Monkeys is haunting, tuneful and impeccably constructed,\nand if the Boo Radleys must pretend it is still 1995, Comb\nYour Hair reminds us of those good times.\nIt's not bad. If Oasis had released this, I would have\nbeen pleasantly surprised. But there's just one filler track\ntoo many, and the 'Radleys can do much better. Wake\nup. Boo, and smell the coffee. El\nAli Campbell\nU.N.K.L.E. SHERYL CROW\nPsyence Fiction\nAlready heralded as the album of\nthe decade by some critics and\nfull of singers any other album\nwould die for, UNKLE's debut will have\nto knock the listener out with brilliance\nJust to avoid disappointment. Or else\nwhat chance does it have of going\nbeyond expectations?\nAlmost the entire album is very dark\nor depressing, which is not that surprising when you have Yorke and Ashcroft\nguesting on it. It starts off with Guns Blazing and the effect Shadow and Lavelle\nhave on the album are immediate. An\nuninspiring rap is saved by some good\nsampling and mixing and a strong bass.\nShadow manages to produce the track\nwell enough so that if there were no rapping over the top, it wouldn't matter\nthat much and might even be preferable.\nThe guitar ing of the title track Unkle\nthen kicks in and doesn't alter through\nthe song, but is just given different environments to live in. The phrase background music springs to mind, either\nthat or a master class in how to DJ.\nInevitably UNKLE will be compared\nto Massive Attack and from listening to\nthe main Bloodsatin you can hear why.\nThey've even incorporated former Massive Attack arranger Will Malone for\nAshcrofts track. Massive Attack have\nbeen almost unique for so long that\nanyone else nearing their territory will\ninevitably come under their label, even\nif there is a vast difference.\nAshcroft has proved on Urban\nHymns that he can sing and gel with\nThe Globe Sessions\nbeat driven tracks, look no further then\nThis Time. Lonely Soul almost works, but\nthe beats seem to just miss a true fit. It's not until the orchestra takes over that the\nsong seems at rest and gets the real\ndepth that it wants to achieve.\nWhy Nursery Rhyme was ever put on\nthis album, I don't know. Having stated\nthe sound of the album, it then tries to\nconquer all arenas. Nursery Rhyme is a tuneless track led by heavy guitar ing, in\nwhich you couldn't even hope to hear\nany of the brilliance of Shadow or Lavelle.\nThankfully Celestial Annihilation\nsaves us. A track with a bass line that\ncould be in any sci-fi film is again kept\nalive by the production and the years that\nthe album took to bring together are easily accounted for.\nThe end track Rabbit In Yout Head\nLights puts UNKLE a step above their\ncompetition. Sure, it's hard to go wrong\nwhen you've got Yorke, but the bareness\nand simplicity of this track adds to its\nbeauty and impact, where adding anything more would take it away. The eerie\npiano is perfect and Yorke's voice adds\nto the song's sound of desperation.\nThe contrast in tracks reveals the\nreal talent of UNKLE. Throughout, whatever you think of a song, you can't blame\nthe production, for the few lesser songs\non the album it's more a case of a good\nsculptor working with bad clay. It's not\nrevolutionary in any way, more, what's been done before, but far better. H David H. \u2022 t's that third album that everyone\nI supposedly always talks about.\nI Most demand a change of dire c tion, or a subtle change of emphasis,\nbut where does Sheryl have to go?\nWhen you think of Sheryl at her best\nthe songs that spring to mind: IFIt Makes\nYou Happy, All I Wanna Do and Winding\nRoad have all allowed her voice to reach\nits full capacity in range and strength and\nhave been upbeat or pac cy. Sadly she\nseems to have forgotten this part of her\nmusic, sobering up into her late twenties.\nHer native America now shines through\nmore noticeably than before; country\nmusic has taken over.\nfans won't be disappointed. She\ndelivers a mellow, well balanced album,\nbul manages to fall back into the label\nof just typical female guitar music, her\nvoice being the only difference.\nIf you liked her first single from the\nalbum Favourite Mistake or presently\nwearing a cowboy hat with matching\nsnake skin boots, then the album suits\nyou down to the ground. The easiest way\nto describe it is as an album with no sin-g les. One of the only really mind stopping songs is The DiFFicult Kind. It starts\nmuch the same as the others, but has a harmony in the chorus that rips your\nheart apart. It's worth listening to the\nwhole album just for that line; Andrew\nLloyd Webber would be jealous.\nSheryl Crow in her last two albums\nmanaged to bridge the gap between\ncountry and western and pop music,\nbringing a new attitude to the British\ncharts. Sadly she seems to have forgotten why she was so successful and\ncopped out with far easier and consequently more drab songs. There are\nsome typical Sheryl songs on the album\nfor example Crash and Burn, when her\nvoice is allowed to let rip, but these\nmoments are few and far between. It's not a bad album and anyone who liked\nthe last two will inevitably like this one,\nbut it's just such a waste when someone\ncapable of so much cops out with an\neasy album; what next, an album of love\nballads?

I imagine you've located the bar, found a cash machine and are now well positioned to get absolutely plastered. I know you've also spotted someone living on your landing, three doors down, of\nwhom you'd quite like carnal knowledge. Well, the grim reality is that in four weeks' time you'll be in lectures, and the\nobject of your affection will be in bed with someone else. Your best bet is to read the following carefully, ignore any\ncynicism which might have escaped the editor's eagle eye, and enjoy Freshers' Week while you are still footloose, fancy\nfree, and most importantly, in credit.\nSaturday 3rd October\nWarp Six\nSunday 4th October\nTears before bedtime\nWith a bit of luck, it is now Saturday and\nyou're reading this while sitting on your\nbed, watching your parents\npack your stuff away neatly in the\nwardrobe and considering\napproaching the Hall warden\nto get a transfer to a single /\nroom, following the discovery\nof some half-digested food in\nyour room-mate's bed. Many\nof you will be feeling a bit\nanxious right now; this is\nextremely common. The solution\nis simple. Get out of your room as\nquickly as possible, find some people\nwho don't look too weird, and with your\nhead and your wallet held high, plot a course for the bar. Warp six. Make an\neffort to get to know the re-apps; they\nhave a duty to make you feel welcome and, between pints, will\ntell you everything you might\nwant to know (albeit in a decreasing ly sober fashion,\nI'm afraid). In two hours'\ntime you will be wondering\nwhat you were worried\nabout. One piece of advice\nthat might be worth remembering when you are staggering\nback upstairs is the following: the\nlandings will all look the same. Think\nhard before getting your keys out, or you\nmight make your first enemy.\nSunday can be a bad day. The experience of waking up in a. strange\nenvironment coupled / x with a colossal hangover can\nmake even the most beau\nti ful morning seem like the first\nfew hours of a life prison sentence\nIf a tearful telephone call back home\ndoesn't help (and it didn't in my case),\nthen the solution is once more to get\nout. There should be a few people\naround who are blissfully unaware that\nit was you who copiously barfed into the\nsink on your landing, so round up a posse and have a wander around the\nlocal area. (If spending your parents'\nhard-earned cash doesn't cheer you up,\nthen you are beyond help, if you'll forgive my bluntness.) There will most likely\nbe a social event in Hall today, which you\nshould not miss, even if you are feeling\npretty gro tty from the night before. You\nmight also want to check out the Student Union; you will be spending\nmany nights and quite a few\nshekels there, and there's \u2022 fe. time like the present.\nOh, and let neither of us \" ^ ^ ^ pretend you aren't going to get drunk again tonight. Try\nto keep your clothes on this time.\nMonday 5th October\nComplaining mass\nTuesday 6th October\nPhotographer\nYou say you already know what a queue\nis? What was that? You're accusing me of\nbeing condescending? Sorry, my friend,\nbut I have been here two years already.\nI know what queues really are.\nThe first endless line to join is the\nregistration queue:\nthis complaining mass\nof students will materialise from 9:30\nonwards. The latest\nopinion from our\nesteemed editor is\nthat the JCR (Junior\nCommon Room) will\nbe finished on time,\nand this is where registration usually takes place. It is situated off the Sherfield Walkway (follow\nmap or signs or use your finely-honed\nhoming instinct). Alternatively, registration is also possible from 28th September onwards in the Sherfield building.\nqueue (k ju:)(n.) l.a line of people, vehicles etc., waiting for\nsomething...\nlevel 3 (the Registry). You will be given\na worthless-looking piece of paper, but\ndo not be deceived: if nothing else, you\nneed it to get at the cheap Union beer.\nTake this document to the Union with\nsome passport photographs and\ndemand an ICU card.\nYou can also get a ULU (University of\nLondon Union) card\nat this opportunity,\nalthough you will\nneed another photo.\nAlso happening on\nMonday are the CCU\n(Constituent College\nUnion) welcomes;\ntimes and locations are in your trusty\nUnion handbook.\nMonday night is fresher s' Ball night;\nget yer tickets early.\nIt's possible, and does not require a terrific stretch of the imagination, to think\nof Freshers' Week as one long party,\nfledgling student, meet your depart-ment. After this initial introduction, these\ntwo are seen to be s noggin g outside the\ntoilets, will embark on a love-hate relationship, get\nmarried and will\nbe together long\nafter the party has\nfinished, before\narguing on a thermonuclear scale and\ndivorcing each other\nthree or four years\nlater.\nWelcome to your department.

According to a recent survey these are some of the\nmore unusual souvenirs that globe-trotting students will be bringing home\nas a reminder of their summer abroad.\nSome of the more bizarre souvenirs included a dried llama foetus\nfrom Peru, bullet casings and grenade\nouter s from a volcano in Rwanda and\na camel dung ashtray.\nThe survey, conducted by Visa\nInternational and STA Travel, revealed\nsome remarkable facts about how\nBritish backpackers spend their money:\nBackpackers biggest worries were losing money, luggage or their passport,\nwith very few being concerned with\nlocal customs, etiquette or language\nbarriers.\nHolsten Bier Fest\nIt has been confirmed that the annual\nHolsten Bier Fest will again take place\nin Battersea Park later this month. The\nBier Fest aims to recreate the atmosphere of an authentic German Oktoberfest, with two pint steins, German\nfood and tribute bands.\nMusic at the Bier Fest will include\n'The Real Abba Gold', 'The Cheeky\nMonkees' and The Sound of the Bee\nGees'. Forty thousand people are\nexpected to attend this year's event,\nconsuming more than a quarter of a million pints of Holsten Export.\nThe Bier Fest runs from 12 October\nto 1 November. Tickets cost from \u00a33\nto \u00a37 and can be booked by phoning\n0171 344 0044.\nMCC Admits Women\nMarylebone Cricket Club, one of the\nmost influential forces in world cricket,\nhas finally voted to accept female\nmembers, after a211 year binge of\nmale exclusivity.\nThe announcement was made this\nweek, following a69 percent majority\n'yes' vote amongst the MCC's mem-be rs. As well as providing sexual equal-it y, this move also allows MCC access\nto much-needed National Lottery\ngrants, which were previously un avail able.\n\u00a34.5 million will be made available\nto the club, a sum which was withheld\nby the Sports Council on the grounds\nthat MCC did not accept men and\nwomen on the same terms.\nDespite an eighteen-year waiting\nlist, the MCC are confident that there\nwill be female members by the turn of\nthe millennium.\nMedics Have a Ball\nCharing Cross and Westminster Medical School Students' Union (CXWMSU)\nappear to have been somewhat careless in the organisation of their summer ball at the end of last term.\nAccording to one source the event\nmade a loss of more than \u00a340,000,\nalthough the exact figure could not be\nconfirmed as Felix went to print. Dave\nHellard, ICU President, explained that\nthe matter was under investigation but\ncould not comment further. A more\ndetailed report will appear in Felix in\nthe next few weeks.\nRussel Group Again\nThe Russel group, an association of\nleading research-led universities of\nwhich Imperial is a member, has\nunveiled plans for a scheme by which\npostgraduate students on Masters\ncourses would be able IO transfer their\nstudies without hindrance between\nestablishments adjudged to be of a comparable standard. The system\nmight lead to a 'gold standard' postgraduate qualification. The move has\nbeen attacked as elitist snobbish by\nuniversities excluded from the plans. A vice-chancellor of a university in the\nRussel group said 'What the group is\nseeking to move towards is a general\nacceptance that a credit achieved at\none university automatically entitles a student to move to another university'. Sceptics fear it will be a step in the\nwrong direction, re-establishing a divide between established universities\nand former polytechnics at a time\nwhen integration and common\nground is being sought.\nOxford Union\nPresident Expelled\nAll Campbell\nThe president of Oxford University's students union has been expelled from\nher studies, following allegations that\nshe cheated In an examination, according to an article In the Times newspaper.\nThe piece, which appeared in the\n9th September edition of the publication,\ndetails an investigation into the conduct\nof Katherine Rainwood, 22, who is said\nto have used \"unfair means\" in her final\nyear examinations.\nRainwood was reading politics, philosophy and economics at St. Hilda's College, and was allowed to sit the\nexamination in a separate room from\nother finalists, due to her claim that she\nwas suffering from a wrist injury.\nThe protagonist was provided with\nsupervision for the exam, and allowed to\ntype answers into her own personal\ncomputer.

More people and media\ntypes attended the show than ever\nbefore, the show itself was larger, and\nthe Sony party was amazing, complete\nwith a concert from Pulp. However, the\nquality of games being shown was appal-ing.\nAbsentees included Electronic Arts\nand Sega, who were showing their unfinished Dreamcast hardware to a select\nfew at a nearby hotel. Rumours of a Sonic title at launch continue...\nSony had three main titles to back:\nSpyro - a Mario-a like with excellent\ngraphics; Medievil - an off-beat platformer with a reanimated knight as the\nmain character, and the eagerly awaited\nPAL conversion of Tekken 3. Round 1...\nFight!\nNintendo was displaying its many\nforthcoming games. The most popular\n(and promising) was certainly Zelda: Ocarina of Time which was surrounded by a constant crowd of spectators. F: Zero was\nvery disappointing, with featureless\npolygonal tracks and low detail cars.\nEidos had the most impressive stand, helped along by a certain Ms Croft putting in an\nappearance for the cameras\n(pictured right). Despite the pub-li city. Tomb Raider III looked like\nanother formulaic zombie.\nInfogrammes impressed\nmany with its vox el based game\nOutcast which, although slow,\nlooked outstanding.\nIt's clear that in the PC mar-ket, everyone is expecting 3D graphics cards to be installed. In\nfact, all of the games looked\nvery similar due to their reliance\non accelerated hardware. One\nthat did stand out from the crowd was\nDescent III, if only for a lovely 'water-hit-ting-the-windscreen' effect.\nKonaml had me queueing for ages\nto see a six minute video of Metal Gear\nSolid, then have a quick go on the game\nitself. This continues to look amazing,\nand I can't wait to get it home.\nLego had an interesting PC control\nsystem on show, and a virtual lego set.\nPersonally, I can't see the point.\nThe BBC was pushing its fe le tubb ies licence - apparently it will be an\neducational title to help children speak.\nNo irony there, then.\nMost amusing bits of the show: a guy with the name tag \"Mr N.E. Body\";\nthe students who snuck in disguised in\ntheir dad's suits, who then stood out\nlike a sore thumb; the 300 billion button\njoystick that \"accurately models the real\ncontrollers in an F15\" and last but not\nleast, the guy with the name tag \"Tariq\nAziz, Iraqi Foreign Minister\".\nMark Baker\nNightlong\nTrecison work in progress\nThe year is 2099. Governments are pow-er less, and the world Is controlled by\nmassive corporations. You play Joshua\nRcev, a private detective working on a dangerous case for his old friend, the city\ngovernor. Spicing up your life is Eva\nTompson, the \"beautiful, intelligent and\nvery elegant\" owner of the Free Climax\nNightclub.\nNightlong is a futuristic detective\nthriller with pre-rend c red graphics, 'jaw-dropping' FMV and a gritty, 30-some-thing lead character.\nIf that sounds a little too familiar,\nthen you'd be forgiven for mistaking\nNightlong for Westwood Studio's Bladerunner, adapted from the legendary sci-fi film. Comparisons are\ninevitable, although the Italian development team are keen to distance themselves from accusations of pl agar is m. \"From our point of view, the two games\nshare almost nothing,\" claims the eight-year old developer. \"Our mood is not\n'Noir' but takes inspiration from the classic cyber-punk novels by William Gibson.\nAnd we have also a completely different\napproach to puzzles, which are not just\n'evidence retrieval', but involve more\ncomplex and challenging tasks. Our 3D characters look definitely less 'block/. We\napproached the adventure genre in a more traditional fashion, because we\nreally wanted the story to nail you to your\nchair.\"\nThe game certainly looks wonderful,\nand is sure to raise the already high\ngraphical standard for point-and-click\nadventures. What remains to be seen is\nwhether Trecison can create a game thai\nis truly i mmer sive, or just another fM V laden turkey.\nMark Baker\nLavish rendered scenery fills Nightlong's three CD-ROMs.\nBuck Bumble\n(N64)\nmii m \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\nGood Nintendo games are in danger of\nlosing their endangered status, with a good, new platformer and at last a decent racing game,- the third bus in the\nrow is Buck Bumble.

This time you play the role\nof the only cybernetic, genetically\nenhanced, and surgically-messed-about\nwith bee fighting off the alien mutant\ninsect oid s and preventing total destruction of little cuts ie earth insects (though\nthe loss of wasps should be considered\nacceptable losses). So it's a simple case\nof finding the enemy and making sure\nit ends up on the floor with its legs in the\nair - not all that taxing really. Where it is\nreally good is in its graphics especially its\nfast-moving colourful 3D backgrounds.\nOK, so it might look a little like Lylat\nWar's all range mode but after a few\nminutes of dodging the stems of the\nmini-jungle, Lylat is a distant memory.\nAlso with its 20 multiple missions and a few hidden bits, coupled with the 2\nplayer mode which is actually playable.\nit should hold interest. In fact the only\nproblem I had with the game was the\nNintendo 64's graphics fogging, but\ngiven the option between fogging, popup and spending \u00a31000 on a decent PC\nsystem I 'll accept it this once.\nGary Smith\n\n"

    "content": "8\nFeature 2 October 1998\nThe Cavemen of IC?\nImperial College Caving Club are held In high regard by caving circles worldwide for their expeditions Into previously unexplored subterranean Slovenia. In Summer 1998, they returned once more to the dark depths. Jan Evetts describes the pitfalls.\nM ost people will never undertake\nan expedition in their lifetime,\nbecause expeditions are for only\nthe elite, and certainly not for students.\nMost people will never put themselves in\nan unfamiliar position, outside of normal\neveryday experience, so that the only\nreliable guide that they have is them-selves, because that is for the fearless (or\nthe mad!). And least likely of all, nobody\nis going to wake up one day and discover\nsomething! What I would just like to say\nis: bollocks. This year twenty members\nand ex-members of Imperial College\nwent to Slovenia (formerly Yugoslavia)\nand did just that. Six weeks were spent\nliving on a plateau at eighteen hundred\nmetres, surviving on dried food and rain-water, whilst exploring a cave one thousand metres deep, and sometimes\nspending three days underground at a time.\nThe Area Exploration by cavers from IC has focused\non a plateau at eighteen hundred metres\nabove sea level on the southern edge of\na region known as the Juliske Alps (Julian\nAlps). The Juliske Alps run from the\ndolomites in Northern Italy, through\nnorth-west Slovenia (roughly south-west)\nand are about one hundred miles long.\nIt is a stunning area: the mountains rise\nabruptly from three hundred metres to\ntwo thousand metres. The\nlimestone of which they are\nmade has been forced up\nfrom beneath the sea over\nmillions of years and the\naction of water, eroding\ndeep gorges and valleys, has\nalso created huge underground cave systems. In 1995\nand 1996 these caves were\neventually broken into by\nmembers of IC caving club\nThe plateau known as\nMigovec is saddled between\ntwo mountains to the north\nand south, whilst to the west\nit plummets nearly 1.5 kilometres into a gorge known\nas the Tolminka and the torrent which runs along the bottom comes\nstraight out of the mountain sides. What\nincites exploration is that in theory the\ncave too could be fourteen hundred\nmetres deep. This is in the top 10 deepest in the world, the first being 1600m and the deepest found by a British team.\nThe Logistics\nThis was big: I could make\nout a floor,\nmaybe forty\nmetres down,\nbut my helmet light\nseemed suddenly feeble.\nPreparation for such an expedition starts\nearly, contacting sponsors for dried food,\nchocolate bars and money. Before leaving London a Union\nminibus is loaded wil h all\nour equipment; the journey\nto Slovenia is a non-stop\ntwenty-four hour drive.\nMigovcc is at eighteen hundred metres and access to\nthe cave has to be easy for\nexploration to be efficient.\nThis means living, sleeping\nand having all equipment\nnear the entrance. Unfortunately the highest road goes\nto a village at only eight\nhundred metres. This vil-l age, Tolminske Ravne, is\nour low level base camp,\nlor the first six days equipment is carried to the top\ncamp. It's a hard, three hour climb, but\nthe best way to prepare for four weeks\nof equally hard caving. The top camp or\nbi vi is a large depression on the plateau\nstraddled by a rock bridge. The bi vi is the\nliving area for the expedition, all the\nfood, cooking equipment and caving k il is stored there - we lack only two essen-ti als: water and electricity. Electricity is\nobtained from solar panels, whilst rainwater is collected from tarpaulins which\nare hung across the bi vi. Tents are\npitched on the hard ground nearby.\nHistory of the Expedition\nExploration on Migovec was started\nnearly twenty-five years ago by the local\ncaving club. They found a cave five hundred metres deep that ended in a huge\ncavern eighty metres high and one hundred metres wide. They named it Galactica, whilst the cave was given the\nglorious title M16. Expeditions from\ntrance and England explored the area\nbut found little more. In 1994 the head\nof the local club replied to a enquiry\nfrom a member of IC about possible\nsites for exploration in the area. Migovec\nwas mentioned; in 1994 and 95 the area\nwas recce d and explored again. Little\nwas found except for several tight caves.\nOne named Torn T Shirt was proving particularly grim, but it was pushed and\npushed, not to an end, but through\nincreasingly challenging squeezes. The\nbreakthrough came late on in 1995, the\nlast grim squeeze. The Nutcracker in\nTorn - T was passed and an impressive\nhorizontal passage two hundred metres\nlong greeted the weary explorers. It was\nintersected by large shafts and offer cd numerous routes for exploration. Optimistically . it was named Level 1. In 1996\nthe excited cavers returned and almost\nimmediately found Level 2, a passage of\nepic proportions. Level 2 immediately\nshowed many similarities to Level 1: hor-i zonta l, and intersected with shafts, but\non a much bigger scale. The really big\nshafts had to be traversed around. Level\n2 ran east to west: to the west it grew in\nsize until it was twenty-five to thirty\nmetres high and fifteen metres wide. In\n1997 a small passage at the west end of\nLevel 2 led to a large pit; it was the start\nof the vertical stuff! from minus three\nhundred metres at Level 2 the cave\ndropped, in a series of stunning shafts,\nto minus seven hundred metres, and\nbeyond.\nPushing in Sistem Migovec in\n1998\nMy first pushing trip (a caving trip when\nyou are exploring a new cave passage)\nwas in Sistcm Migovec, in Slovenia, and\nthe situation was comical to say the least.\nI was also quite nervous because it was\nthe first time I had hammered in a bolt.\n(When caving with rope the rope obviously must be tied to something; either\naround a convenient rock, or more\ncommonly to a bolt which must be man-\n"

This is because we must now\nuse external printers, since the Union\nPrint Unit has been closed down, and\nunfortunately they are not as quick (and\nprobably not as good) as dear Andy\nThompson. I would like to take this\nopportunity to wish Andy all the best in\nhis future music career - anyone not\ngoing to the Freshers' Carnival could do\nworse than the Water Rats, Gray's Inn\nRoad, Kings Cross that Friday night.\nOI, you! Yes, you! Read this!\nIt has been a summer of mixed blessings\nfor Imperial students. The announcement of a new education and welfare\nsabbatical, along with London Transport's decision to provide discounts on travel-cards, are both important developments,\nif long overdue. The fresher s among\nyou, however, are probably more concerned with tuition fees and how you are\ngoing to afford three or more years in\nLondon. Meanwhile old hacks will be\nwondering if we will ever get a full complement of sabbaticals and Union officers\nfirst time round.\nWhich brings me on to the age-old\nproblem of student apathy. There is\ngoing to be an election in a few weeks\ntime in which YOU, the students, are\nthe electorate. We wouldn't have a fifth\nsabbatical or cheaper travelcards if it was-n't for Union officers, at ICU and else-where, fighting for students. YOU\nchoose these sabbaticals, YOU vote for\nthem: Their job is to represent YOU.\nRemember that when Monday 9 November arrives.\nLet's get stuck in...\nThe BMS has been a nightmare from\nstart to not-quite-finished. It was never\ngoing to be ready on time; we all knew\nthis, some of us even dared say it, but\nnow the proof is before our eyes. Sure,\nit Is a very nice building (especially the\nglass lifts) and, yes, teaching will start in\nit on time. Talk to the people who have\nto work there, however, and you'll get a different picture. 'The great move' will\ncertainly be remembered, if only for its\nappa ling organisation. I should know -1\nwas waiting half the summer for the\nBiology Common Room to be vacant so\nI could set up the new Felix office. Biology are still moving.\nThis space Is sponsored by\nLondon Electricity Board.\nThank you for your generosity\nMy old department and I Ihus share\none thing in common - we've both been\ntreated with utter contempt by the\nLstates Division. I dare say that statement\nwill prompt replies from the higher ranks\nof Biology, but we know what the people on the ground arc saying. I am also\naware that many of the problems can be\nblamed on the contractors. I have other\nreasons for my opinions, however.\nMy story is as follows: It is now 8.30am on a cold and damp Wednesday morn-ing, I have two hours to finish this first\nissue, and I haven't slept for a good day\nor two. A week ago I was not in the\nslightest bit confident, which I took as a good sign. I had barely started the layout and staff were failing their exams like,\nwell. Union officers. Advertising was\ncoming in as if Geri Spice was my business manager, yet actual articles were\nsparser than firsts in Aero Lng. Then, one\nparticularly stressful evening, I was\ninformed that the new office was only\n'temporary accommodation'. I knew that\n- Felix is only here for a year or two. 'No\nno no - very temporary.' How temporary,\nexactly? 'As in November temporary. As\nin Estates want the room back.' Fortunately they changed their minds, but I'm still tempted to charge them for two\ndented filing cabinets.\nNot to be outdone, the next day\nthey tried to stop the Union using the\nGreat Hall for badminton, fortunately\nthey couldn't ignore a prior minuted\nagreement guaranteeing the. Union's use of the Hall (although they obviously\ndid at first). I 've been hearing (pre sum ably unfounded) rumours about\nflowerbeds, car parking spaces and daffodils worth their weight in gold. It's going to be one of those years. Still, I'm an open minded man, and the letters\npage is always there for your comments...\nWhat else?\nNothing really. Believe It or not, there\nwas a lot of news. News writers, how-ever, are somewhat harder to come by.\nThe final emergency-ad-to-fill-space for\nthe news pages came courtesy of London Electricity Board, who decided to\ncut all power to Beit from midnight Tuesday until 4am Wednesday. The first I knew of it was when security came round\nat 11.55pm. Hence I had to come back\nat 4.30am this morning to finish this oh-so-memorable first issue. So forgive me\nif it's not up to expectations. If you've got\nideas, you know where to come. I'm out\nof them and off to bed. And whoever is\nresponsible for choosing last night to\nmake emergency repairs, stay out of my\nway... td\nS PEOPLES TIAN SOCIETY THE BUZZ ON CAMPUS\nOn behalf of everyone at His People,\nwelcome to Imperial College.
