The crowd was\nii u shed as Barton stepped up, the atmosphere\nwas electric. Slowly Dick moved towards the\nball as the Westminster goalkeeper fidget ted nervously on his line. Then Dick struck the\nball sweetly towards the corner of the net but\nthe Westminster goalkeeper leapt to his left\nand palmed the ball off for a corner. However,\nthe Sixths managed to hold on to their six\ngoal lead until the final whistle.\nIn fact this was the Sixths biggest win of the\nseason. Chamberlain scored the first after the\nWestminister goalkeeper could only parry\nMartin's shot. Haberlin was the next to score\nwith a fine header from a corner. It was\nfollowing another corner that Chamberlain\nscored the third goal after Haberlin headed\nagainst the bar. The Sixths continued to\ndominate the game with Martin outstanding in\nmid-field. Roche added a fourth with a header\nfrom close range but despite further\npressure the score was four-nil at half-time.\nIn the second half, playing against the\nwind, the Sixths created fewer chances. After\na quarter of an hour Coussens scored the fifth\ngoal following a fine solo run. The game then\nstagnated for a period and all credit should be\ngiven to Higham, Haberlin, Bradley and\nDavies in the defence for coping admirably\nwith Westminster's occasional breaks. The\nsixth goal came midway through the second\nhalf when Roche's powerful cross was\ndeflected into the net by a Westminster\ndefender. IC continued to press forward but\ndid not add to their score.\nTEAM: Hampton, Higham, Bradley,\nHaberlin, Davies, Tinkler, Martin, Gartside,\nCoussens, Roche, Chamberlain.\nFencing\nOUR return match with Kings College,\nLondon, on home ground was overall, as\nsuccessful as our away match had been. We\nfielded two foil teams of four members each\n\u2014 the A team and a mixed ability B team \u2014\ntogether with one Epee team of three\nmembers. I'm afraid that our sabre team was\nyet again disappointed as no opposition\nsabre team was available \u2014 bad luck lads.\nThe Epee team came up against particularly\ntough opposition and lost 6-3, the same score\nas in the away match. On a more optimistic\nnote, both foil teams won convincingly. The A team conceded only 6 out of 16 bouts, Chris\nWachnicki remaining unbeaten. The whole\nteam produced highly entertaining fights with\nsome beautiful hits \u2014 pity we didn't bring a camera. The B team were also on good form,\nJohnathon Reed winning all of his bouts.\nSpecial congratulations are due to Hugh\nMacGillivray, who, in his first match, won\nthree out of his four fights with some very\nneat blade work; well done Hugh.\nThanks are due to Phil Bird who presided\nmost ably over the B team match and did all\nthe general dogs body work on the evening.\nFoil A(106) Team: Bird, Crisp, Parker,\nWachnicki.\nFoil B Team (12-4): MacGillivray, Reed,\nSpottiswoode, Tsui.\nEpee Team (3-6): Collins, Perkins,\nWachnicki.\nCamborne\nWeekend\nLAST weekend saw the massed heathens\nfrom a certain Mining polytechnic in Cornwall\nsent back west with little more than a narrow\nvictory in one out of six events.\nThe competitions began well on Friday\nevening with a resounding 5-0 victory in the\nsquash. It's been several years since RSM\ncame out top, and there was certainly no\nbetter way to get things back on the right\ntrack. Congratulations to the team led by\nDave Molesworth and ably backed up by\nRalph David, John Stocks (repeating third\nyear for the eighteen eth time). Rich\nThompson, and Mark Patterson.\nNo problems were had in the table tennis\nwith Rich Fifieid (ULU number one) leading\ntii e way. The only criticism is that CSM won\ntwo out of ten games. The one disappointing\nevent of the evening was the badminton held\nin the Great Hall. Hard luck to the six RSM\nplayers who were narrowly edged 4-5 into\nsecond place.\nWith the tension gradually mounting, the\nfootball and hockey teams with the more\ndedicated RSM supporters left the Union\nearly on Saturday morning.\nCSM decided, unlike previous years, to\nbring a hockey team with them. After a quick\nstart by RSM and a gradual takeover of\ncontrol the result was never in question after\nI went two up midway through the\nsecond half. With several players having to\nplay out of position the final performance was\nquite creditable. Maybe the CSM will think\ntwice before bringing another team up to\nHarlington.\nBy one o 'clock the number of supporters\nhad grown sufficiently for there to be a cup-tie atmosphere during the football. The CSM\nware revoltingly noise y after a first minute\ngoal, but were soon shut up by an overwhelming barrage on their defence. By halftime RSM were three up.\nWas it complacency or sympathy that\nallowed CSM to pull two goals back? No, it\nWham!!! Dashing her ioc s on the hockey field.\njust made their inevitable defeat that more\ndisheartening. RS M, captained by Tom\nHanke, performed magnificently.\nEven though the RSM were now 4-1 up in\nthe match results, the success of the whole\nweekend hinged very much on the result of\nthe Bottle match. The tension before the\ngame in the changing room was unbearable\nand the atmosphere electric.\nThe game proved to be very hard indeed, as\ncan be seen in the number of injuries\nreceived. Two CSM players had to be taken\noff con cussed and one with a broken jaw.\nFurthermore the CSM winger flaked out after\nthe game; he was also con cussed. Doug\nMcintosh had to be led off with ten minutes to\ngo with a twisted ankle.\nThe only scoring in the first half was an\nexcellent penalty goal by Keith Maynard.\nKeith had an excellent game and his kicking\nwas superb and did much to inspire the team\nto go forward.\nGood defensive work in the second half\nsaw RSM soak up a lot of pressure and\ngradually more into attack. Mark Daniels and\nRay Parkinson were stopped just a yard short\nin a period of sustained RSM pressure.\nEventually a line out on the CSM line led to\nMcintosh going over for the first try,\nbeautifully converted by Maynard. From the\nkick-off a certain CSM prop reverted to low\nflying head-butts and succeeded in breaking\nhis jaw and stopping the game for six\nminutes. The' result was never in question\nnow and only complacency allowed CSM to\nscore an un converted try in the last minute\nAlthough the game was a bit scrappy at\ntimes it was hard fought with total commitment from both sides.\nThe Dinner to follow was a rather rowdy\naffair with CSM proving what animals they\nreally are. The Bottle was duly returned to the\nUnion Bar on Sunday and now RSM can say:\n\"Didn't we stuff Camborne\".\nflags 10 FEUX, February 27,1981\n\n"

    "content": "Letters to\nthe Editor\n\u2022MSk\nDear Sir\n(letter unreadable - Ed.)\nTours sincerely\nAnne Evans xxx\nAero 3\nDear Mr Marshall\nThe remarks which you made\nin your FELIX Editorial last\nweek about HRH Princess Anne\nare utterly despicable. Even if\nyou hold these views in private it\nis completely disloyal to publish\nthem. As for criticising Princess\nAnne for her hobby (at which she\nwas very good) it smacks of the\nlower middle class intolerance\nthat we have come to expect from\nFELIX this year. Princess Anne\ndoes a good deal of charity work\n(e.g. National Society for the\nPrevention of Cruelty to Children) for which she receives\ninadequate credit from gutter\npress editors like yourself. In\nclosing I would suggest that you\napologise and then do the honourable thing.\nl ours very sincerely\nFrank James\nHumanities PG Sir\nWith reference to your comments of Princess Anne, you Sir\nare obviously excluded from the\n23,000 students \" with brains\".\nFor one who can express\nhimself in such a childish and\ninsulting manner should never\nhave been elected to edit the College or any other maga-zine, and as regular readers of\nFELIX, my colleagues and I are\ndisgusted by your obnoxious inference to the Princess (sic).\nJ Mather and tele ph on is t s:H Lori bond, J Skech, K Franks, A Mitchell, PC road, P Chandler,\nD Walters, P Rule, J Longdon,\nand W Jacks.\nSir\nWe feel much ashamed to be\nmembers of a College whose\n\" newspaper\" publicise s such\nmalicious insults as contained in\nyour last editorial. From your\ndescription HRH Princess Anne\nseems to be a much more charitable person than yourself.\nWhatever you may think of\nour new Chancellor it was very\nwrong of you to malign one\nmember of our Royal Family as\nthis is also a direct insult upon\nother members for whom we\nhave reason to have much respect\nand regard.\nWe find it hard to corr t pre he nd that your editorial is a true\nthermometer of the feelings of the\nICU Exec and even less of the\nvast majority of students at IC. We think that the Exec would\nbe well advised to remove you as\neditor of FELIX before you cause\nany more mud to be splattered\nover us all.\nYours regretfully\nDavid Pinnegar & 48 others\n_ \u201e. Physics 2\nDear Sir\nYou may hold the opinion that\nPrincess Anne is not suitable for\nthe Chancellorship of this University, but there is not cause\nto be downright abusive.\nYours\nJohn Mornement\nCi vEng1 Dear Sir\nOne of the golden rules of good\njournalism is that individual members of the Royal Family are\nnot 'fair game'.\nOne of the hallmarks of bad\njournalism is sensationalism. It is\nthe last resort of the uninspired\nand tired.\nYours faithfully\nMark Clegg\nMe chEng3 Dear Sir\nNot content with repetitive ly attacking Mr Mooney to the\npoint of utter tedium and printing racist and generally insulting cartoons, you have now\nlowered your standards of\njournalism even further with your pathetic and puerile attack\non Princess Anne in your editorial\nlast week.\nWhatever your views of our\nnew Chancellor (my own are\nhardly complimentary), there\ncan be no defence against your\nusing FELIX to air such vehement\nabuse against any individual without the slightest attempt at\nproviding justification. Your cheap attack on such an easy\ntarget was neither clever nor\namusing, and I must presume\nthat you did not consider the\nharm that would be done if a representative of the mass media,\nsearching for student reaction to\nthe choice of Chancellor, were to\nseize upon your remarks as being\nrepresentative of the student\nbody at IC. The public would\nsurely conclude that it is us,\nrather than Princess Anne, who\npossess the 'intellect of a cab-b age'. Or perhaps you were\nencouraged by such thoughts,\nsince you appear to enjoy cheap\npublicity.\nIf you manage to complete\nyour term as FELIX Editor, I hope you will continue to express\nyour opinions, but please refrain\nfrom using unjustified and highly\npersonal abuse.\nYours faithfully\nAndy Tye\nCi vEng3 Sir\nWith reference to the article\nentitled Operatic Diversion Diversion, I note with more than\na little trepidation that the dates\ngiven for this opera clash with the\ndates already booked for the\nHAM DRAM81( Home Co un ties Amateur Dramatic Festival)\nFinals. As this is the first time\nsuch a prestigious festival has\nbeen hosted by Imperial College\nit would be tragic if it were\nmarred by a bookings oversight.\nIs there some mistake? We would\nhate to disappoint those who\nhave already purchased tickets\nfor HAM DRAM81( available\nfrom the Bookshop or IC Dramsoc\nmembers) and hope that last\nweek's article was incorrect.\nGeoffrey Barber\nHAM DRAM81 Liaison Officer\nEd's Comment: Dram soc have\nassured me the situation is totally\nunder control.\nSir\nI write in response to DV Molesworth's foolish display of\nignorance in his letter of February 6 for FELIX. Let me quote two of his\nsentences: \" I am not so naive that\nI believe there is no injustice in\nthe Republic\". To blind DV Molesworth, the obvious injustice is not so important to be\ncondemned. \". . . these firms\nespecially some of them . . .are\nprobably leading the way to\nnarrowing the gaps between 'blacks' and 'whites' standard of\nliving\". If DV Molesworth is\naware of the different living standards based on colour, then\nhe ought to be aware of the\ninjustice in the system he admires\nso much.\nPerhaps, we will forgive DV Molesworth for being so naive to\nrealise that being white in South\nAfrica, he was in such a priv il aged position \u2014 high wages,\nlots of incentives, etc. \u2014 as to pay\nno attention to the injustice\nmeted on others. He is now being used (from the tone of his\nlast paragraph) to augment the\nwhite population and match the\npopulation imbalance if not\nwhite majority. What he should\nbear in mind is: South Africa can\nnever be another Australia or\nNorth America.\nHas DV Molesworth been a black South African and seen his\nwife for only two days in a month\nand had seen his little sister\ngunned down over a protest in\nthe Soweito-clash, he won't believe\nthat as justice.\nMaybe DV Molesworth will\nbe happy to hear of Botha's latest\npromised to improve the position\nof Blacks by allowing a few\nBlacks' black-representatives in\nParliament. I rephrase his\nstatement as the creating of\nMuzorewa's( Black puppets) to\nundermine the liberation move-men ts.I assure him and Botha\nthat the liberation war continues\nunabated and that paying a lip\nservice to democracy does not\nweaken the efforts. If he wants to\nbe a disciple and a propagandist\nof an Apartheid regime then he\nshould be prepared to claim responsibility fo r the very difficult times yet to come.\nLet us be frank, DV Molesworth is not becoming anti-Anti-Apattheid as he claims. He is for\nthe Apartheid regime. To be an\nanti-Anti-Apartheid is to be pro-Apartheid, there is no middle\nterm. He tries to hide his\nbold less ness by a long phrase o logy.\nReading his letter, I can now\nunderstand how the holocaust of\nthe Jews, the genocide of Amerindians, the slavery and the\ndominated economy of the\nblacks, etc., have been possible.\nYours truly\nFAm and leNYa wC i vEng Dear Steve\nThe article of Mr Paul Simons\non guide to farting ( FELIX577) leads me to believe that he seems\nto think that he has fired the last\nshot as far as understanding farting is concerned. While I appreciate his attempt to scientifically analyse this socially stigma tis ed phenomenon, I should like to point out that a more detailed analysis than his\nhas been in existence for nearly a century. I refer to The Art of\nFarting or the Sly Artilleryman'.i Manual by Count Trumpet, Doctor of the Brass Horse. This\nfascinating piece of research, which bears no date, seem to have\nappeared in the nineteenth century in France. And thanks to\nSalvador Dali, who reproduced it\nas an appendix to his auto biography, a greater number of\npeople will be able to understand\nand appreciate this noble art now\n(see, Salvador Dali, Diary of a Genius - An Autobiography, Appendix1, pp 217-251, Picador,\nLondon1976).

    "content": "Results: Saturday, February 21\nHockey\nIC 1stV Thames Valley 3-1\nIC2nd V Harrow 2-1\nIC 3rd V British Airways 0-0\nFootball\nIClst V LSE 2-3\nIC2nd V LSE 2-1\nIC3rd V Kings 1-1\nIC4th V Kings 4-3\nRugby\nIC'A'V Old Kingsburians 9-42\nFootball Seconds\nIC's impressive first half performance was\nenough to give them both points and a hundred per cent record at home this season.\nThe afternoon had not started well when\nonly nine players arrived in the Union\nLounge. The goalkeeper problem was solved\nhowever when Al Betts, who had returned to\nIC for the previous night's Aerosoc dinner,\nwalked in and accepted the offer for a game.\nInside the first ten minutes of the match, IC\nwere in front after Veenman had forced the\nball across the area and Hartland rifled his\nshot, on the run, past the helpless keeper.\nFurther pressure again paid dividends when\nBeer volleyed his shot against the keeper with\nsuch force that it rebounded and allowed\nhim a few more attempts before finally\nsqueezing the ball home.\nLSE however, are a good footballing side\nand were not going to give up easily. The\nimpressive Betts was forced to make two fine\nsaves when faced with a rapidly advancing\nforwards. In the second half LSE increased\nthe pressure to little effect, whilst IC\nsquandered the chances which c oud have\nmade the game safe.\nLSE eventually scored with fifteen minutes\nto go when a shot from outside the box hit a post and rebounded kindly to the feet of an\nLSE forward.\nThe last quarter produced some frantic\nstuff, although the tenacity of every member\nof the side was enough to give IC the win that\nthey thoroughly deserved.\nTEAM: Betts, Dunhill, Beer, Armstrong,\nLakin, Griffiths, Wiggins, Lay, Veenman,\nHartland, Saunders.\nJim Beer\nFootball Fourths\nIC took the field with three changes from their\nregular team for the top of the table clash.\nThe Fourths started well, gaining control of\nthe midfield and should have taken the lead\ncheering this spell of pressure.\nTwenty minutes into the game Hawa gave\nIC the lead when a break led to him scoring\nfrom just inside the box. This led to more\ngood play from the league leaders.\nThen disaster struck, Buckley in the right\nback position, with time and space to play the\nball anywhere passed straight to their centre\nforward who hit a first time shot past\nHampton. The match then became scrappy\nand rough play resulted with Burns, Hawa\nand Graves all' involved in fights with the\nopposition.\nAfter half-time IC looked the better team,\nand McNicholas gave them the lead when\nafter a long ball from defence he scrambled\nthe ball into the net. King's defence were\nagain caught square and Burns lobbed the\nadvancing keeper to give the Fourths a31 lead.\nLack of concentration in defence allowed\nKings to reduce the deficit before the best\ngoal of the match. Buckley beat two men and\nran thirty yards before curling a shot just\ninside the post. Again King's scored quickly\nbut IC's defence managed to hold out and\nenabled IC to gain the two points.\nTEAM: Hampton, Clegg, Gohill, Maddy,\nChown, Buckley, Graves, Dolan, McNicholas,\nBurns, Hawa.\nCastaways Cup\nTHIS is one of the most important and\nprestigious events in the ULSC calendar. All\nthe London colleges and City University are\ninvited to enter a three boat team and IC\npresented two teams to defend the title again\nthis year.\nThe racing took place over last weekend\nand the first race was timed for just after 9:30\non Saturday. However the Harp was frozen\nand by the time racing started (almost an\nhour late) the efforts of the rescue boat zigzagging up and down the lake and of the few\nhappy souls who had taken a boat out had\nmade depressingly little impact on the\nsurface.\nIC 2 were due to sail the first race and using\nthe tactic of sailing in ice free channels were\nwinning easily until the first mark. Here the\nalmost unbroken ice brought all the team to a halt, unable to tack, and in danger of giving\npenalties if they touched. However new-found skill and some luck got them\nunscathed out of the situation and they went\non to gain first, second and third positions.\nAs the day proceeded the ice cleared and\nsome good team racing was seen. IC 2 were\nbeating most people on the water, but giving\npenalty points to anyone who cared to ask, in\none race giving three \"greens\" (63\n/4 points)\non the start line before the race. They finally\nlost to both UL teams, QMC and IC 1 but beat\nCity on are sail. This gave them six wins and\nfifth place in the competition. A good\nweekend's sailing considering the team\nconsisted entirely of first years.\nIC 1 however owned the competition. They\nbegan showing little potential, winning race\nbut only by narrow margins but as Saturday's racing continued a combination of good\nindividuals, people with team racing\nexperience and fast sailing ability, began to\nshow as one after another the teams fell to\ntheir superior force. By Saturday evening, as\nthe teams retired to hot food, the bar and barn\ndancing, arranged by Castaways, IC 1 was\nthe only unbeaten team having shown its\nversatility and consist an cy through changing\nwinds and weather conditions.\n9:30 Sunday morning again saw the team\non the water for are sail against UC2, this was\na farce, since although IC managed to put\nhastily rigged boats on the water for the re sail UC2 had requested, UC couldn't manage to\npresent a team and IC1 merely sailed the\ncourse alone. This did however give a measure of the again vastly different weather\nconditions. In contrast to Saturday it was\nblowing quite hard and it eventually became\nnecessary to reef the sails.\nThe league table should have been\nconcluded with a match between IC1 and\nUC1 but by the appointed time it was clear\nthat it was these two teams that were to meet\nin the final and with Wembley SC putting\nmore and more boats on the water it was\ndecided to go straight into the final, best of\ntwo races.\nIn the first race Lewis moved immediately\ninto first place and Baker, covering the\nopposition stayed just ahead of Murray and\ntwo UC boats in second, with first and second\nposition, a winning combination the two\nleaders sailed for the finish. UC needing the\nbest placings possible should have pushed\nMurray back to sixth, but rounding the last\nbouy with only yards to go they let him\nthrough into third place. IC retained their\nunbeaten record and needed only one boat\nin the first three to win the competition.\nIn the second race Lewis again got a good\nstart and sailed away from the fleet in first\nplace with Murray and Baxter loos ly covering\nthe opposition up.\nThe beats they retained third and fifth\nplaces, despite some de spa rate manoeuvres\nby UL during which a green was given. The\nfinal result was IC1 retained their unbeaten\nrecord over the weekend beating UC1 in the\nfinal by 15V2 points to 26 (first, second, third,\nfirst, third and fifth) and retain in o the Cup.\nA word is due here to thank Cestaways for\norganising an event which went j ff smoothly\nand was enjoyable both on and off the water.\nSnooker\nTHE B TEAM with a new line-up managed to\ncrush a QMC team who lacked talent and a sporting attitude. Mr P Holt kept up his good\nform by winning convincingly. Bennet\nmanaged to lose in a dull frame where talent\nand inspiration were in short supply.\nThe battle of the two top league teams took\nplace last week when our very own A team\ntook on our C team. The result shocked most\nof the people concerned when the A team\nwon by five frames to nil. The C team were\ntaken by surprise when their veteran players\nlost frame after frame to an A team riddled\nwith young upstarts.\nThis year's AGM will be held on March 11.\nPapers for next year's committee posts are\nup in the Snooker Lounge.\nWater Polo\nLAST Saturday, Bristol University came to\nLondon to give us a match, in return for our\nvisit last month. Both sides were hoping to\nimprove on the 4-4 score last time.\nimperial started very well, and scored three\ngoals in the first quarter, while only\nc once e ding one. Last, Heffeman and\nMcCartney took turns in our goal, each\nplaying well.\nThe end result was a pleasing 8-3 win for\nImperial. Goals came from Barry, Nick, Mike\nand Richard.\nTen Pin Bowling\nON Sunday, February 22 four enthusiastic\nmembers of the Bowling Club set off to bowl\nin the Pompey Quads Tournament at\nPortsmouth. When we left London at 9:30am the weather was cold but the roads were\nclear, however, on reaching Hindhead, half\nway to Portsmouth, the weather was\nappalling with compacted snow on the roads.\nOnly skillful driving on J Knight's part\nprevented an accident. We arrived unscathed\nand after sampling the local brew we\ncommenced bowling. The bowling was\ndivided into two sets of doubles and the\ncombined quads competition and after\ndisappointing bowling by all players in our\nteam we lost the Quads Trophy that Imperial\nheld last year. However, individual trophies\nwere won by McMullan and Cook. For the\nhighest handicap doubles series. Finally\nthanks must go to Knight for providing\ntransport.\nHyde Park Relay\nDID you know that Imperial College is the\nhost of one of the country's top athletics\nevents? Out very own Hyde Park Relay starts\nat 2:00pm on Saturday, February 28 on the\nsouth side of the Serpentine. Helpers and\nanyone who can put safety pins in envelopes\nshould meet in the morning in the Union\nBuilding. Spectators are welcome. You may\nsee some well known athletes (Seb Coe?).\nLook out for confirmation of these details\nbeside the Union Staircase.\nFEUX, February 27,1981 Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "OLD PREVEfiS/MS\ndMB3 o3 Committee on Academic Organisation\nThis Committee was set up about this time last\nyear within the non-medical side of the university\nto consider and recommend in broad terms what\nredeployment of resources available for non-medical studies within the University should be\nadopted in order to maintain academic excellence\nin its teaching and research, having regard to the\nneed to make financial economics and to attempt\nto safeguard the future of all staff employed within\nthe University.\nThe committee have recently produced a 'Discussion document' which is fairly detailed in\nits financial estimations and in the options\navailable. It is unfortunate however that\nthroughout the document most references and\nstatistics are made about 'the non-medical of the\nUniversity (excluding Imperial College)'. This\nhappens because IC is funded directly from the\nUniversity Grants Committee (UGC) while the\nother colleges which are funded by the UGC through the Court of the University.\nThus the document would appear to have little\ndirect relevance to IC but on reading through it, it\nbecomes obvious that the problems that face the\nrest of the University are the problems that face\nIC also, although to a varying extent.\nThe Discussion Document outlines the\nfinancial prospects which have resulted from\nvarious Governmental decisions.\nThe drop in UGC income to the non-medical\nUniversity (excluding IC) will be 17.6% by 1982/3.\nThis will occur because the Government is\nremoving that part of the Treasury Grant to the\nUGC which has in the past kept overseas student\ntuition fees below the 'full cost' rate.\nThus if all overseas students remained and paid\nthe 'full economic cost' to study here the grant\nwould not decrease.\nOverseas student numbers have dropped and\nit is assumed by the Committee that they drop by\n50%. The Committee estimates that the drop in\nstudent numbers in London will be about 10% and\nthe drop in income will be 15%.\nThe other main threat to income is in birthrate\nwhich produces a consequent drop in numbers of\neighteen year-olds, so that by 1995/6 the number\nof eighteen year-olds will be 69% of today's number. This fall is mainly in the lower social\nclasses which are less likely to send students to\nUniversity.\nAlso the cash limits policy which presently\napplies will cause a reduction in real grant if pay\nincreases are above the percentage recommended by Government.\nThe Committee then ask if their assessment is\ncorrect and if so how are the problems to be\nsolved.\nThere are constraints on any action taken.\nFirstly the schools of the University are\nconstitutionally autonomous but the financial\ndecisions can be taken by the Court. Secondly\nthere is the principle of 'academic tenure' i.e. when a lecturer is appointed he can remain until\nretirement \u2014 that is the basis of the contract and\nas such, reduction or redeployment of staff is\ndifficult to say the least. Lastly there is a natural\nresistance to change.\nThe possible solutions are:\n1. Do nothing! This is not really viable.\n2. Distribute the diminished grant equitably\namong schools; thus those who have a high\nproportion of overseas students would be cut\nmost e.g. SO AS.3. Cut each school equally by about 15-20%.\nThis is a policy of 'pernicious anaemia'.\nThe implementation of either of these solutions\nwould lead to a possible 15% reduction in wages\nand salaries expenditure. The choice being\nbetween fewer and smaller departments. Smaller\ndepartments are undesirable primarily for\nacademic reasons i.e. same number of lectures\nfor fewer students, isolation of staff, replacement\nof staff in specialised fields, etc.\nThe methods by which staff can be reduced are\nNatural Wastage and freezing of posts, Voluntary Retirement or Redundancy. Natural\nwastage would take a long time to implement and\nmainly senior staff would be affected. This would\nmean that senior staff would account for less than\n40% of all staff as is laid down by UGC. Voluntary\nretirement would cost too much.\nRedundancy might be least harmful. But again\nthe question of Academic Tenure arises.\nTermination of contract may lead to court action\nfor wrongful dismissal. A special fund would be\nrequired. Already the CVC P( Cttee Vice\nChancellors and Principals) has asked the\nGovernment to set up a special redundancy fund\nfor universities.\nHOUJ it affects IC\nThe Discussion Document itself refers to IC very\nlittle but the financial problems faced by the\nUniversity are faced on a lesser scale here. At\nFinance and Executive Committees staff\nredundancies were well discussed; one problem\nbeing that the time will come when the College\ndoes not have the money to make redundancies.\nThat time is not far off.\nOverseas student numbers here have fallen to\n771 (994 in 1979/80; 1,074 in 1978/9). The\nproportion of overseas students now at College is\n16.9% (21.3% in 1979/80; 23.1% in 1978/9).\nNumbers will continue to fall for at least a further\ntwo years by which stage the 'full cost' fees will\nhave been implemented. In effect the lack of\noverseas students (and their fees) and the lack of\nmoney from Government will have a serious\neffect on the College and on the University. The\nGovernment does not realise the seriousness of\nthe problem which its own policy imposes on\nuniversities.\nWhat happens in the rest of the University will\nnot affect IC financially. Perhaps we are better off\nas our future is in our own hands unlike some of\nthe smaller colleges who may face closure by the\nUniversity.\nThe discussions in IC which have been initiated\nb v the Swinnerton-Dver discussion document are\nthose which would lead to independence from the\nUniversity. This would remove the University\nadministration and leave us as a University in our\nown right validating our own degrees, etc.\nFor IC Union it raises the question of facilities\nwhich we share as part of the University particularly sporting facilities. It also raises the\nproblem of the voice the Union has in student\nmatters which has been channelled through UL U in the past.\nResponses to the Discussion Document must\nbe returned by March 31. It will be discussed in\nCollege at Board of Studies and Governing Body\nbefore then. We will discuss it at External Affairs\nand Council with the odd OPEN Meeting for good\nmeasure on Wednesday, March 4. in the Lower\nRefectory at 7:00pm.

We\nvisited 101 people (consisting 65 first years, 28\nsecond and third years and 8 PGs) and asked\nthem 17 questions divided into 5 sections.\nSection 1: Sabbatical Officers' Popularity\nThe most remarkable feature of this section was\nthat nearly half those questioned were unable to\ngive an opinion on John Passmore's performance,\nand nearly two-thirds on Rae Snee and Liz\nLindsay. Of those expressing a view, people were\nmore or less evenly divided on Passmore and\nSnee, and strongly in favour of Lindsay.\nIgnorance certainly wasn'ta problem with\nSteve Marshall, with only one sixth of the people\nnot giving an opinion. The remainder approved of\nhis performance by a majority of a little under 2 to\n1. It is worth remembering that the poll was\npredominated by first years who have no\nstandard of comparison by which to judge the\nsabbaticals' performances. Thus further analysis\nof the results (ignoring don't knows) shows first\nyears slightly, in favour of Passmore and seconds\nand thirds slightly against. Firsts were slightly\nagainst Snee, and second and thirds about even.\nWith Lindsay both groups approved of her\nperformance, the second and thirds to a much\nstronger extent. Both sections approved of\nMarshall, the first years more strongly so.\nSection 2: Performance of Marshall\nThis section aimed to find out whether people\napproved of Marshall printing the controversial\n'New Years Honours Shock' in FELIX, January 9.\nAs expected, most people had read the article,\nand of these, nearly two-thirds approved of him\nprinting the article, humourous ly intended or not.\nHaving said that, most also thought Pub Board\nwas correct in asking Marshall apologise publicly,\nand privately to Mr Mooney. A substantial\nminority (one third) felt, however, that Pub Board\nwas too harsh to do this.\nSection 3: ReappKcants in IC Halls and\nHouses\nHere, we wanted to find out what students feel\nabout the problem of whether or not some people\nshould get second years in residence, and it\nproduced some of the clearest response of the\npoll. (It is worth remembering that the\nrespondents were Hall residents, and the results\nshould be interpreted with that in mind). Over\nthree-quarters felt there should be re apps in\nresidence. Lesser, but still clear-cut majorities,\nfelt that students should have the main say in who\nthe re apps are and that the wardens should have\nthe power of veto on re apps. Section 4: Student Loans\nThis part was designed to assess (i) the level of\nignorance about the possibility of student loans\nbeing introduced in the next couple of years and\n(ii) what people thought of the idea. We\ndiscovered that 20 of the 101 hadn't heard of the\nproposals, and a further 25 didn't know what that\ncould entail. The remaining 56 split roughly 4 to 1\nagainst the idea.\nSection 5: Nuclear Weapons\nHere, Consoc wanted to know what students felt\nabout various aspects of this controversial\nsubject. Firstly, excluding don't knows, more\nthan two-thirds felt Britain's national security\nwould be threatened if we undertook unilateral\nnuclear disarmament, and over three-quarters\nthought that such a course of action wouldn't encourage other countries to discard nuclear\nweapons. Again, after getting rid of don't knows,\nsmall majorities approved both of Cruise missiles\nbeing here and of Britain building Trident\nsubmarines.\nThe poll obviously has limitations, namely that\nthe respondents were mainly first years, and all\nwere in Hall. However, going round Halls means\nyou get to see a random sample of students, that\nyou don't do the same person twice, and that\nusually you see the student individually, so that\nyou get a single person's view rather than a group's view, which you might get going round\nthe JCR at lunchtime. say.\nThis article aims merely to present the results,\nnot to interpret them, and interested people and\ngroups can draw their own conclusions about\nthem.

Dr Hunt outlined the path of the\nVoyager II spacecraft by the use of some truly remarkable slides taken\nby the Voyager crafts. The data obtained by the spacecraft has given a wealth of information on the geophysical nature of Jupiter and Saturn.\nDr Hunt was particularly excited by data obtained from Titan, as at a lite of Saturn. Voyager II has shown that Titan has a planetary\natmosphere similar to that of prime vil arth, and perhaps more\nimportant, simple hydrocarbons have been detected indicating the\npossibility of life.\nDr Hunt said that space had to be developed and that the returns\nwere only just beginning to trickle in. Advances have been made in\ninstrumentation allowing satellites to be used more efficiently in\nmeter ology. Dr Hunt predicted that very soon, by means of the space\nshuttle, zero gravity space laboratories could be used to build things\nsuch as perfect crystals which would be useful in microelectronics. Dr Hunt then added that he would be prepared to justify space on purely\nacademic grounds. \" We must go out there and explore. We are the\nColumbuses and Magellans of today and we must maintain our\npioneering spirit\".\nWhen questioned on what would happen next Dr Hunt said that\nVoyager would arrive at Neptune in 1989 but that all future\nprogrammes, such as the Gallileo Dapiter probe, would have to be\nreviewed in the light of the recent Reagan spending cuts.\nRaymond Baxter at IC\nRaymond Baxter, ex-RAF pilot and BBC TV presenter was\nguest speaker at the Aeronautical Society Dinner last Friday.\nThe Dinner was well attended and Mr Baxter's speech much\nappreciated.\nCONS OC SUPER SPECIAL\nMeet THE Cabinet\nCome and hear\nRt Hon Mark Carlisle, MP\nSecretary of State for Education\non\nTUESDAY, MARCH3 at 1:00pm in Huxley 213.\nPedalling\nfor\n24 hours\nLAST WEEKEND, thirty Guilds\npeople went to Bristol for the\nannual 24-hour Pedal Car Race.\nThe new car \"Snotgobbler\"\nwas built at great speed, but,\nunfortunately, could not continue\nin the race for more than the first\nfour laps.

Giles\nShaw\nspeaks\nFormer Northern Ireland Junior Minister Giles Shaw, MP visited\nthe College last Tuesday at the\ninvitation of the Conservative\nSociety to give a talk on 'The\nLast Eighteen Months in Northern Ireland'. Mr Shaw,\nwho became a junior Environment Minister in Mrs Thatcher's recent reshuffle, began by outlining the background to the\npresent situation, and then proceeded to comment on the\nsecurity and political issues in the\nlast eighteen months.\nHe said that the level of\nterrorist activity overall was\nsteadily declining, with terrorism\nconfined to limited areas. The\npolice force was gradually taking\nover security duties from the\narmy, with the eventual aims of\nrestoring normal policing and\nthe rule of law to the province.\nMoreNorth/Southcooperation\nis coming about on security, and\nMr Shaw said he believed there\nwas a greater understanding by\nthe Republic of the North' s problems and a willingness to\nwork together to defeat terrorism.\nOn the polit cal front, Mr Shaw\nsaid it was almost impossible to\ndistinguish a route to a compromise solution of Northern Ireland's complex problems, but that governments must continue along the 'thorny road' in an\neffort to find a solution because\nthe troubles are not going to go\naway. The audience of about fifty\nwas then given a chance to\nquestion Mr Shaw.\nFELIX, February 27,1981 Page 5\n\n"

The main way they are likely to get\n\"known\" is through the pages of FELIX and\nunless they do something to alleviate the\nstagnant state of ICU soon, they are liable to\nbe forgotten completely.\nIt amazes me that it is just these type of\npeople who are awarded pots and U GAs at the\nend of the year for \"their unfailing devotion to\nthe Union\".\nI think Scaramouche is gradually taking over\nthe back page. Aaarrrgh!!!!!!\nMore problems for Prime lia College Orchestra. They have been planning an\ninformal musical evening for the week after\ntheir concert, but apart from a general\nconsensus that it should consist of five pieces,\nthe third being for oboe and piano, everyone\nhas a different opinion over what music should\nbe played.\nNevertheless, after much discussion, the\nfollowing has been agreed on. There must be a piece for clarinet and piano immediately before\na piece by Beethoven. Something by Mozart\nshould immediately follow a piano trio. There\nmust be a string quartet, which cannot be\nplayed next to the piano trio, but must go next\nto a work by Brahms. And there must be a piece by Schumann, and a piece for horn next to,\nbut on opposite sides of, a piece by Saint-Saens.\nNow there must be a way to please\neveryone. But how?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o FELIX Office. There is a prize of \u00a35 (donated\nby Mend-a Bike) and two tickets to the IC\nOrchestra concert for the correct entry\nrandomly selected at 1:00pm next Tuesday.\nLast Week's Solution\nJ_ I J_ 2_2_4,4,2\"3n,3TT. Imagine the can divided into two identical\ncylinders, and consider the top cylinder. After\nthe first pouring, the empty part of this\ncylinder is the same size and shape as the part\nwhich contains beer. Thus the first student\ngets a quarter of the beer.\nAn identical argument applied to the whole\ncan shows that half the beer remains after the\nsecond pouring. So the second student gets a quarter of the beer.\nNow to calculate the fourth (and thence the\nthird) student's share, I'm afraid you do have\nto use calculus, but there's one easy approach\nand several hard ones. The easy way is to take\nvolume elements parallel to the axis of the\ncylinder. The FELIX typesetter won't do-mathematical symbols, so we'll have to change\ntypeface here.\nNow the volume elements are rect-l angular with length x. \u2014 and width\n2 2\n2/(r x). So the volume required is\nV= JJj x.|.2/( r2 x2) dx\n21 ,r.11 x2)* dx\nr1,22,2,r[^ Cr - x)]02o23*. Since the volume of the whole can is\n2 2\nTir I, the last student's share is -r \u2014\n1 2 ^\nand so the third student gets ^ - -JJJ-The winner is A Shiekh.\nThere can't be many students at IC who\ndon't have A level maths, and so I had no qualms\nabout setting a puzzle which needs calculus\neven if it did cause several people to pour\ncoffee over their lecture notes last Friday.\nThis week's puzzle, in case you haven't guessed, is a plug for IC Symphony Orchestra's concert on March 6, not to mention their\ninformal musical evening on March 12. Next\nweek's puzzle is a plug for IC Choir. Mend-a Bike are still offering discounts to FELIX readers.

    "content": "Letters\nto the\nEditor\nContinued from page 2.\nis a shameful matter, dear reader,\nthat in spite of your long experience of farting you still do\nnot know how you fart, or how\nyou ought to fart. It is commonly\nthought that farts differ only in\nsize and that basically they are\nall of the same type. A gross\nerror\" (Dali, op cit, p217). The analysis of Mr Simons is faulted\nby the same error.\nAs the learned scholar points\nout, farts can be divided into\nvocals, and mutes or silent creepers. Vocal farts may be\nfurther divided into:( i) The Pleuri-Vocal or Big Fart (further\nsubdivided into simple and dip thong or double barrelled farts), and( ii) the Semi-Vocal or\nLittle Fart (further sub-divided\ninto Clear, Medium and Aspirated).\n\" Mute farts, vulgarly known\nas silent creepers, have no sound\nand comprise a small amount of\nvery damp wind. In Latin they\nare called Visia, from the verb\nvi sire; in German Fiesters; and in\nEngish, fitch or vetch\"( Dali, op\ncit, p234). They may be either\ndry or sunny.\nThe Count further classifies\naccording to the social status of\npeople (followers of Max Weber\nought to be pleased), going largely by the subtle differences\nin smell. The categories he lists\nare: Provincial Farts, Household\nFarts, Maiden's Farts, Fencing\nMasters' Farts, Young Ladies\nFarts, Married Women's Farts,\nBourgeois Women's Farts, Peasant Women's Farts, Shepherdesses' Farts, Old Women's Farts, Bakers' Farts, Clay Potters' Farts, Whores' Farts,\nCuckolds' Farts, Clerks' Farts,\nActors' and Actresses' Farts and finally, Learned Men's Farts. Iam sure even Mr Simons would\nagree that this is definitely a more definitive guide to the art of\nfarting than his.\nFor those, who even in this day\nand age, persist in their prejudice\nagainst farting, there is a chapter\non Ways of Disguising a Fart\n(chapter 12). This work of art is\nsheer pleasure to read. As the\nauthor points out. \" It is indeed\nmore important than people\nnormally imagine, to know how\nto fart in the right way at the\nright time.\nA fart that tries vainly to come\nout,\nAnd then turns back in fury to\nsend the flanks,\nOften causes death.\nFor the life of a constipated\nmortal through the dark portal\nentering,\nBy a FART let out in time\nmight well have been saved.\"\n( Emphasis as in the original, Dali, op cit, pp 217-8).\nTours Sincerely\nBharat Bhushan\nDSE SPG Dear Sir\nObviously Mr Simons, author\nof last week's \"Definitive Guide\nto Farting\" is not a true devotee\nof the art of farting. Iam fully in\naccordance with his observations\non the sometimes pathetic attempts of amateurs to \" pitch\" or \"tease\" a fart, but I must\nstrongly object to his advocating\nre basing an SBD.. and then\ndisclaiming it!!\nAs a founder member of the\nFlatulence is Artful, Relaxing\nand Transcendental Soc. Iam therefore drafting this short note\nto point out to your readership\nthat farting should be looked on\nwith PRIDE, and not denied as a shy perversion.\nExtensive field research has\nshown that 99.9% of the population fart, so DO NOT BE AFRAID! Ignore Mr Simons heretical advice and break forth.\nThe world lies at your feet (note:\nThis could also be due to the\n'Irish Mist',a strange concoction\nproduced as a result of a peanut\nbutter and chili sauce diet. It is\noften accompanied by severe\nblistering).\nTours sincerely\nColin Devey\nGeology II\nDear Sir\nAlthough reluctant to join the\nranks of letters page contributors\nI feel moved to comment on the\n' Definitive Guide to Farting' published in last week's FELIX. It was encouraging to find some\nattention being given to this\nmuch maligned pastime, but Mr Simon's article put forward only\none of the facets of a rewarding,\nthough misunderstood hobby. While having compiled an excellent treatise on the auditory\nvariations Mr Simons has paid\nscant attention to the olfactory\nnuances in her antin the raison\nd'e tre of the fart.\nA certain individuality is\nalways imparted to the bouquet\nby the particular gut flora of the\nperformer. This enables a ff ici an a does to pinpoint the origin of\na virtuoso rendition when modesty or unconsciousness prevents the owner claiming it.\nThere are however several substances which will lend distinctive reproducible flavours\nto one's emissions. Many traditional beers have their own recognisable odour s for instance,\nWadworths Old Timer, known\nas Old Fart by regulars, which\ncan be identified in minute concentrations two hundred yards downwind of many Wilt shire pubs not to mention the\nAnglesea Arms. The combination of the calcium sulphate and\nyeast content of Bass found in\nmany outlets produce an e men a tion common to many IC stu-dents. Iam surprised that the\n' high' quality of food in the\nCollege refectories does not cause\nmore motions to be passed at\nUG Ms. Well known aromas( not necessarily attributable to the\nsubstance after which they are\nnamed) include:\nThe egg y one: this v are ty linger\nlonger than Murray mints.\nThe cabbage y one: savage! A real\nswine. Airwicks the only answer.\nThe be any one: binds covalently to\nthe nasal mucosa.\nThe yeasty one: LD50 really low,\nbanned by Porton Down. The butter curry: combined with\nthe burnt ring syndrome and the\ndead rat \u2014 charcoal underpants\na must for this one.\nThe SBD fart may embody\nany one of these but extensive\nresearch has proved the most vile\nfarts to be those that are heard as\na soft pop followed by a hiss.\nA final comforting thought attributed by some to Dr Samuel\nJohnson: No man cannot stand\nhis own farts (or something like\nthat).\nTours f artfully PI Morris\nReal Ale Soc Publicity Officer\nSir\nAs residents of Linstead new\nblock, we were most surprised to\nsee your front page article in\nFELIX557\" Imperial College\nDon accused of being an urd!\" Although we are in the habit of\ndisplaying messages, the one in\nyour photograph has never appeared on our windows. Most\nof the printed article is fabricated\nand has misled many FELIX readers. We would like to stress\nagain that the photograph is a forgery and we demand a printed\napology.\nTours\nMR Fisher, et al. Dear Ed\nWe went rigid when we saw the\nphoto; it was like a bolt from the\nblue.\nWe didn't realise that the\nmessage had ever existed. How ever, we know it must have\nappeared as FELIX is such a truthful, honest, upstanding organ of the press, and would not\nprint a pack of filthy lies.\nAlthough we agree you have\nthe intellect of a cauliflower and\nthe ability of a mollusc, a short\nglans at your articles reveals a depth hitherto unknown in College (except in the catering\nfield).\nHope you're well\nThe Dicks Club PS: We claim more readers than\nFELIX. Dear Sir\nWe are writing against WIST being allowed to put on their\npicket on Imperial College ground. Both men and women\nattend this College and both should be allowed the same rights\nand status. Presenting women as\nmere pickets is both degrading\nand insulting to the normal women at this College (the ones\nwho don't look like bus conductors). Mines pointed out last\nyear. They also pointed out that\na male stripper was ridiculed in the event, which would thus not\nbe viewed as sexist. However,\nfrom an RS M survey previous to\nthe event, we found out that the\nwomen in the audience viewed\nthe female stripper as a bit of a joke and found the male strip-per's chopper tant a lising. We are\nwell aware that the men to\nwomen ratio is rather large (as\nare most of the women) but would like to point out that this\nproblem will diminish if IC doesn't continue to offer services\nwhich enhance the image of\nwomen.\nWomen who cannot cope with\nthe problem ought to join WIST and go picketing at Mines events\nand on field trips to Yorkshire.\nWe agree that men should not\nactually have to pay to see a woman naked; it should be free.\nIf anyone feels strongly against\nthe picket they are welcome to\n(at) the Mines review on February 27 at 7:30pm.

    "content": "Study in the Shadow of the Gun\nBir Zeit University is a Palestinian\ninstitution in the Israeli-occ up pied territory of the West Bank. More\nthan 1,500 students are currently\ntaking degree courses in both the\nArts and Sciences. Israel regards Bir\nZeit as a \"hotbed of nationalism\",\noften conflict ive with its own ambitions for the West Bank, and a voice to be silenced. The students,\nfaced with the continuing denial of\ntheir political rights, on occasion go\nout onto the streets to demonstrate.\nThe resulting clashes with the Israeli\nmilitary authority add to the cycle of\ntension.\nThe Youth Council of the United\nNations Association is hosting a speaking tour of two student representatives from Bir Zeit. They\nare coming to this College on\nThursday, March 5 to give a talk in\nthe Union Senior Common Room\nstarting at 1:00pm. This is a unique\nopportunity of hearing first-hand\nabout the situation facing fellow\nstudents studying under military\noccupation. Don't miss this opportunity: all are welcome.\nThe following is a very brief\nbackground to the Palestinian\nj robie m. The early history of Palestine\nIn very early times, Palestine was\ninhabited by Semitic peoples, the\nearliest being the Canaanites. When\nthe Tribes of Israel came to Palestine\nafter their captivity in Egypt, they\nvere united into one kingdom by\nKing David in 1000BC. This kingdom\nreached its greatest heights under\nKing David's son, Solomon, who\nbuilt the first Temple of Jerusalem.\nHowever, after Solomon's death, the\nhistory of the People of Israel (or\nrather of the two kingdoms of Israel\nand Judah) is a record of civil wars\nand struggles with alien tribes.\n720 BC: Assyrians destroyed the\nKingdom of Israel and carried its\ninhabitants away as captives.\nu OO BC: The Babylonian king, Nebuchadenezzar, attacked the\nKingdom of Judah.\n\u00bb67BC: Jerusalem and Solomon's'em ple were destroyed by Nebuchadenezzar. Most of the inhabitants\nwere taken captive.\n5 1 7 BC: Jews were able to return to\nPalestine.\n332BC: Domination by the Macedonians, who treated the Jews\nharshly. Following the Macedonian\nrale was a period of certain independence. C'J BC: Roman conquest under\nFompey.\ni' AD: Emperor Hadrian prohibited\nthe Jews from entering Jerusalem.\nFrom this period dates the dispersion of the Jews throughout the\nworld. Since then, until the establish-nen t of the State of Israel in 1948,\nno Jewish Government has existed\nin Palestine. Although some Jews\nI^ ve always lived in Palestine, their\nnumbers have fluctuated depending\non the tolerance of the successive\nrulers.\n7 0 AD: Titus destroyed Jerusalem.\n4 0 0 AD: The partitioning of the\nRoman Empire. Palestine under\nByzantium's rule until:-6 3 7 AD: Arab conquest. After the\ninterlude of the Crusades, the Arab\nruler invited the Jews to return to\nPalestine.\n1 5 1 7 AD: Turks conquered the\ncountry and ruled it until the end of\nthe First World War (forming part of\nthe Ottoman Empire).\nTherefore it can be seen that,\nexcept for the Crusader inter-regnum, Palestine was ruled by\nArabs and then by Turks for over\n1,300 years following the Byzantine\nera.\nThe recent history of Palestine:\n\"The Palestine Question\"\nThe defeat of the Turkish armies\nduring the First World War, with the\nassistance of the Arab uprising\n(some Arab leaders at the time were\nseeking independence from Ottoman\nrule) resulted in the break-up of the\nOttoman Empire. The administration\nof Palestine was then handed to the\nBritish Government.\nHowever, two contradictory promises had been made during the\ncampaign to defeat the Turks. One\nwas to assure ultimate independence\nfor the Arab peoples of the region, in\nreturn for assistance in defeating the\nTurkish army. The other was the\nBalfour Declaration of 1917 which\ngranted the wish of the Zionist\nleadership in Europe to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine.\nIn the following decades, Jewish\nimmigration came into direct conflict\nwith the livelihoods of the Palestinian\npeasantry. Tracts of land were sold\nby absentee Arab landlords to the\nJewish National Fund, which in turn\nled to the dispossession of the Arab\ntenants as the Jewish settlements\nwere established. Through the\ntwenties and thirties, frequent\nclashes between the communities\ntook place sometimes resulting in\nmany deaths.\nAt the end of the Second World\nWar, the British Government came\nunder increasing pressure to allow\nlarge numbers of Jewish refugees\nfrom Europe to settle in Palestine,\nand faced with an impossible situation they decided to hand the\nproblem over to the United Nations.\nThe UN decided upon a partition\nplan to divide Palestine into two\nareas, one with a predominantly\nJewish population, the othe r predominantly Arab. Whilst acceptable to the Zionist leadership, albeit\na compromise with their wishes, the\nArab states refused to agree with\npartition, such that with the ending\nof the British mandate in 1948, war\nbroke out between the newly-created Israeli state and the\nneighbouring Arab states.\nAs a result of the war, and the\nconflict leading up to it, most of the\nArab population of Palestine fled,\nwhile the West Bank carne under the\ncontrol of the Jordanian army.\nJordan formally annexed the West\nBank in 1950.\nIn 1967, yet another war rava oed the region leaving the West Bank\nand Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights\nand Sinai in the hands of an occupying Israeli army.\nSince 1967, administration of the\nWest Bank and the other occ up pied territories has rested with a military\ngovernment. It is directly answerable\nto the Israeli Ministry of Defence and\nhas absolute authority over the\nPalestinian population.\nThe Palestinian people now\nnumber approximately four million.\nAbout half a million of the Palestinians\nlive in Israel. Another 1,200,000 live\nin the occ up pied territories of the\nWest Bank and Gaza. The remainder are in exile, many still in refugee\ncamps, many as foreigners in other\ncountries. The majority of those in\nexile still hope to return to their own\ncountry.\nProfessor Arnold Toynbee wrote\nin 1968: \"The tragedy in Palestine is\nnot just a local one: it is a tragedy for\nthe World, because it is an injustice\nthat isa menace to the World's peace\". The Recent Situation\nThe recent violent street battles in\nthe West Bank in which Israeli\ntroops shot at and wounded unarmed Palestinian student demonstrators received considerable\nattention in the World's Press.\nHigher Education has now emerged\nas the focus for the continuing\nstruggle between Jews and Arabs in\nthe West Bank.\nBir Zeit University is an independent Palestinian institution, located\nabout twelve miles north of Jerusalem.\nIt teaches to BA and BSc level in Arts\nand Sciences, and its degrees are\nnow recognised throughout the\nWorld.\nOne of the major objectives of the\nUniversity is to encourage students\nto stay in the West Bank and work\nwith their community, rather than to\nseek more lucrative employment in\nthe Gulf or the West. Therefore\neach student must complete a programme of community work\neach year, which is then counted\ntowards the final degree, the\npurpose being to encourage greater\nawareness and critical discussion by\nthe students of the problems facing\nthe community. The 1,500 students\nin the University have to spend at\nleast 120 extra-curricular hours on a community work programme. Dr\nMuhammed Hallaj, Dean of the\nFaculty of Arts, says that the\nstudents \"must be actively involved\nin the daily life of their local communities; higher education must\nnot serve as a form of escapism\".\nTrouble started at the University\nearly in 1980 when the native Arab\nWest bankers demonstrated their\nfull opposition to the Camp David\n\"autonomy\" plan about which they\nhad not been consulted, and which\nnumerous UN bodies had condemned as bearing little resemblance to Palestinian self-deter-mi nation. The growth of a sizeable student\nbody in the West Bank vigorously\nopposing the Israeli occupation and\nany attempt to impose the Camp\nDavid agreements clearly alarms the\nIsraelis, as shown by the recent\nharsh action against student demonstrators. The recent moves\nagainst the universities (Bir Zeit and\nthe three other Palestinian universities) are only the latest of a series\nof problems experienced by the\nuniversities as a result of operating\nunder occupation.\nThe problems include the 'invasion'\nof campuses by the military, closures (Bir Zeit was closed down\nfor months in 1979), the refusal of\nthe military authorities to allow the\nentry of certain Arabic books and\nperiodicals, despite the fact that they\nare available to students at the\nHebrew University in Jerusalem,\nand difficulties over obtaining work\npermits for foreign members of\nfaculty.\nAlthough these problems created\nheadaches for University admin-is tr at or s, they did not affect the\nUniversity's basic freedom. Order\nNo 854 issued by the West Bank\nMilitary Governor in July of 1980\nwas thus particularly ominous, as it\nwas aimed at curbing that freedom\nand enabling the occupation author\ni ties to interfere to an unprecedented\nextent. It stipulated that universities\nmust be licensed, implying that the\nlicence could be withdrawn. This is\nseen as placing the Universities\nunder permanent threat of closure.\nIt also said that the names of all\nfaculty members and students must\nbe approved by the occupation\nauthorities, in order to 'weed out'\nthose who had been committed for\nsecurity offences or held for\nquestioning \u2014 and almost every\nPalestinian West Bank family has\nmembers who fall into this category.\nAll courses of study are subject to\nthe approval of the military governor\n\u2014 again, an entirely new kind of\nrestriction. University students say\nthat in recent weeks their notebooks\nhave been seized and scrutinised by\nthe occupation authorities.\nThe universities have refused to\ncomply with the new decree, which\naims to 'undermine the University's status, its independence, its legitimate functions and its academic\nfreedom,\" as a stat ment issued by\nBir Zeit said. The statement pointed\nout that the decree, by amending the\nJordanian Law of Education and\nCulture of 1964, contravened the\nFourth Geneva Convention of 1949\nwhich stipulates that an occupying\npower does not have the right to\nintroduce changes in the laws of the\ncountry under occupation.\nThe content of education is also a source of growing dissatisfaction. As\nDr Ibrahim Abulughod who headed\nthe Palestine Open University feasibility study team says: \"The\nPalestinians in higher education\nhave been educated in accordance\nwith a curriculum over which Palestinians have absolutely no\ncontrol. Since these curricula have\nbeen designed by the national\nauthorities of various countries, they\nwere designed, if they were designed\nat all, in the light of the needs of\nthose societies. The curricula in all\nthese countries have nothing to do\nwith the identity of the Palestinian,\nwith his heritage, with his future\naspirations. They are not designed to\nserve the needs of Palestinian\nsociety, they are not informed by\nPalestinian heritage and culture\".\nBir Zeit University is frequently\nseen as a threat to Israeli authority in\nthe West Bank. Come and hear two\nstudents from this University on\nThursday, March 5 at 1:00pm in the\nUnion Senior Common Room.\nNick Bedding\nIC United Nations Society\n\n"

As\nsoon as he knew about it, he had\nthe nail changed straightaway.\nThere was a similar incident earlier in the week, but no one\nhad brought it to his attention.\nHe had apologised to the student\nconcerned, but as he had made\nsuch a 'song and dance\" about it\nhe would not get a refund.\nOn the subject of College food\ngenerally, Mr Mooney said that\nhe would have to take people's word for it if they thought the\nfood was getting better, as a suggestion which FELIX put to\nhim. Asked about the better\nchips this term from the Union Refectory, he said that the supply\nhad been changed, and as this\nwas found acceptable it was\ndecided to continue it.\nCarnival\nLAST FRIDAY'S Links Car ni val, was attended by about 600\npeople.

The\nGovernment had to give colleges a special exemption from the Race\nRelations Act 1977 before they could implement these increases\". The\nmotion went on to instruct the Executive to obtain an assurance from\nCollege not to increase fees next year. The college did not give such a guarantee, but did agree not to impose a previously decided extra 10%.\nAn emergency U GM motion a week later noted, inter alia \"the full\ncost fees are driving overseas away. There is no financial argument in favour of full cost fees, and college cannot therefore claim\nthat it is under financial obligation to charge these fees\". A motion on\nthem called for \" A total boycott of lectures on Februry 24, pickets of all\nentrances/main departments\". This was declared \"the beginning and\nnot the end\". And emergency U GM motion a week later resolved, inter alia \"to go\ninto immediate occupation of college until college take a stand against\nfull-cost fees. To support the NUS National Lobby of Parliament on\nMarch11\". In a statement issued by the Union, students were urged to\nsupport the boycott. After outlining why it was thought the increase in\nfees was discriminatory and incorrect is said \"only il we say boldly and\nclearly that these fes are wrong, wrong, wrong, will there be any\nchange. An occupation is the only way open to us now to make that\nmessage clear. Other colleges will follow if we take a stand.

UC students visited IC on\nWednesday afternoon to ask for support for their campaign, the aim\nbeing action all over London against the \"discriminatory lee increase\nand the general attack on education\".\nAll unions are being asked to \"take action\" if college authorities\nintend to implement the fee increase, organise a one day lecture\nboycott, and, as a last resort, o cup y College administration.\nICU staged a week-long sit-in in the Sherfield Senior Dining Room last year, this was once again on teh overseas students differential lees\nissue. This protest, although led by the Exec, did not achieve its aims,\nwhich were to get assurances from the Prime Minister, and Secretary ol\nState for Education asking for a review of the Government's Education\npolicy, with particular regard to overseas students. Those people who\nparticipated in last year's sit-in did not feel it was totally in vain.\nTHE INTERNATIONAL PARTY, the culmination of International Week,\nwas highly successful. The evening included Dinner, with Indian,\nChinese, Sri Lankan, and Greek foods. Afterwards there were stage\nperformances in the J CR. This included Greek, Latin American and\nclassical Indian dances, a karate demonstration by a group including\neight black belts. Bhangra dances were performed by a student group\nwho have only been practicing for a few months.\nThe Rector and 600 other people attended the event, which most\nregarded as the best international party so far, and the most popular\nevent in the J CR this year.\nField Cup\nTHE ANNUAL Guilds Field\nCup Competition was held on\nWednesday evening.

    "content": "Campaign Coffee\nWHEN YOU BUY a jar of instant coffee, only\nabout 37% of what you pay will get back to the\ncountry from which the coffee beans came.\nAbout 10% will go to the retailer, and the rest will\ngo to Nestles, General Foods, or Brooke Bond\nLiebig if you buy a \"brand name\", or to J Lyons or\nCoca Cola Ltd if you buy a supermarket \"own\nlabel\".\nIt is in processing the coffee that the profits lie.\nSo, in theory, if the producing countries\nprocessed their coffee themselves, they would\nmake more money. In practice, however, they\nrun into problems with the multinational\ncorporations (MNCs), who may object to \"unfair\"\ncompetition. When Brazilian soluble coffee\ncompanies captured 15% of the American instant\ncoffee market, General Foods complained to the\nUS Government with the result that the\nGovernment threatened to cut off aid and not to\nrenew the International Coffee Agreement (ICA).\nThese companies can have more power in\nshaping some countries destinies than their\ngovernments \u2014 but, as in Britain, a lot of the\nleaders of these countries have also been\ncompany directors, which is' why the M NC s never come under effective fire.\nAlthough the producing countries only receive\n37% of what you pay, it makes up more than a quarter of the export earnings of eleven out of the\nfifty producing countries \u2014 all Third World. In\nBurundi, it accounted for 83% of export earnings\nfor 1972-77.\nCoffee, whilst in no way essential to the survival\nof its consumers, nor the M NC s, is crucial to a producing nation's economy. Although various\nICAs have been made to try to get a better deal\nfor the producing countries, this non-essential it y to the consumers coupled with the fact that\ncoffee beans rot if stock-piled for too long,\nmeans that the producing nations cannot with old the coffee until prices go up, as is done with oil\n(although, after oil, coffee is the most valuable\ncommodity traded internationally).\nAlso, as the 1977 crisis showed, most of us start\nquestioning our \"need\" for coffee if shop prices\nrise by more than a few pence.\nThe M NC s can weather crises like these \u2014 for\nexample, in 1977, Brooke Bond Liebig's profits\nonly dropped from \u00a349 to \u00a341. Nestle is the\nsecond largest food company in the world\n(Unilever is the largest) with an annual turnover in\n1977 of about \u00a3550m \u2014 larger than the gross\ninternational product (GNP) of 51 out of 53\nAfrican countries and 21 times the size of\nTanzania's total world sales.\nIn 1963, soon after independence, the new\nTanganyikan government decided, in conjunction\nwith its policy of self-reliance, to reap the profits\nof processing the coffee itself. But, along with\nequipment problems, they have also had\nmarketing ones. Although Nestle's were called in\nto provide management and marketing skills\ntraining, Nestles \"assistance\" has still not found\nadequate outlets for Tanzania's admittedly more\nexpensive, but high quality instant coffee, nor for\nhelping to train Tanzanians to continue the work.\nThe cost of Nestles expertise to a country\nwhich still has a clean water supply and a dispensary as priorities for every village is\nimmense; but Tanzania cannot afford to do\nwithout it as it is the western nations who have\nthe necessary technology and access to markets.\nUntil recently Tanzanian instant coffee has only\nbeen marketed in Zambia, Kenya and Tanzania\nitself as \"Africafe\". It is now available in Britain as\n\"Campaign Coffee\" and can be bought from\nCampaign Co-op, 52 Acre Lane, London, SW11.\nOn Friday, February 27, there will be a stall in the\nJ CR selling the coffee during lunchtime. Also on\nTuesday, March3, at 6:30pm in the Green\nCommittee Room, as speaker from \"Campaign\nCo-Op\" will be giving a lecture in the exploitation\nof workers in the coffee plantations and how we\nshould stop supporting the multinationals and\nhelp the developing countries instead.\nThe cost of the coffee will be \u00a31 for alO Og packet\nJan Czernuszka\nICCAG\nEVERY FRIDAY NIGHT at about 10:30 they\nused to pack into Falmouth Kitchen as best they\ncould \u2014 the weekly crowd of enthusiastic\nsoup runners. Some were old hands. Some were\n\"socially aware\". Others still were third years\nwho'd never heard of a soup run. Some just\ndidn't want to go to bed, while others wanted to\nmeet different and interesting people. And some\njust came for the drive round London.\nBut whatever their reasons, they've stopped\ncoming, except for a small handful, who obviously\ncan't be expected to come every week.\nWhy don't you come?\nIn case you don't know, people on the Soup\nRun go to various locations in London in a van,\narmed with urns of hot soup, loaves of bread, and\npackets of biscuits, which they distribute to those\nwho sleep rough, perhaps chatting to them for a while as well. Normally back at College before\n1:00am. It's certainly an eye-opening and interesting night out.\nMeet in the kitchen, Falmouth Hall, Southside\nat about 10:30pm every Friday \u2014 at least give it a try!\nPhil\nLloyd\nAppeal\nPhil Lloyd was an undergraduate at Imperial\nCollege from 1969 to 1972 and a postgraduate\nfrom 1972 to 1976.\nTo those of us who know Phil Lloyd as a student at Imperial College, the news of his\naccident and the resulting permanent disability\ncame as a great shock. Phil was one of the\nbrightest students in his year, and during his time\nas an undergraduate, followed by postgraduate\nresearch, made many friends at Imperial College.\nHis individual flair was auto mati ve engineering.\nThis expertise is not bottled up in his mind; ideas\nare waiting to find a way onto the drawing board\nas Phil is totally paralysed from the neck\ndownwards.\nWe can help Phil by raising money to purchase\na mouth-stick operated XY plotter (\u00a3460) plus\nany other computer aids for the severely\nhandicapped that are available. The experience\nhe gains in developing techniques in this new field\nwill help others similarly handicapped.\nI intend to run in London's first People's Marathon on March 29 1981 (26+ miles) from\nGreenwich to The Mall. Sponsorship on a mileage-covered basis could raise the money he\nneeds to get this project moving.\nIf you would like to help to raise money for the\nPhil Lloyd Appeal I would like to hear from you.\nPeter Saunders\nMech Eng Dept\nSF Sock\nIT WAS AN early afternoon in February and the\nclocks weren't striking at all. Fortunately, neither\nwere the authors of the SF Soc Bulletin, which\nthis week comes from the pen of Mark Jeffcock,\nthe paper of Ken Mann, the subconscious of John\nChamberlain, and the angst of Elise Pechersky.\nFor those of you who dislike in-jokes, that wasn't one, so hard luck.\nLove and kisses to Afro-Carib Soc from\nJonathan's stunt hairdresser. Cynicism is Naive.\nThe committee for less sense in SF Sock bulletins\nhas ceased control of this report due to its disgust\nat the rampant eroticism prevalent in Ken's knees. Chris Priest. Sorry about the previous\nsentence but I was told to mention an author.\nTHIS IS ALMOST AS DISJOINTED AS Lot of rot, my whole life has been like that.\nHave you ever read Flight 714 by Herge! Anyway\nArthur C Clarke's just a figurehead.\nA FELIX LEAD ARTICLE I don't know what to write. Actually I was\nenjoying myself with Ken's knees, but my hands\nwere controlled. And now a quote from Mark's watch 16.8938. Thank-you.\nConcealed deep within the heart of this bulletin\nlies a sentence composed by Steve Higgins the\nSage of Salford. To find it; scan all sentences with\na pre ten tio meter. This sentence though short,\nhas the highest reading.\nAnd now here are the main points again.\nWe're showing the Rocky Horror Picture\nShow on March 10. We're going to the One\nTun in Farringdon, for further details come\nto a LIBRARY MEETING on FRIDAYS at\n12:46 in SOUTHSIDE UPPER LOUNGE. We've also done something actually\nconnected with SF. Yes, two authors are\ncoming to College. Chris Priest early next\nterm and JOHN SLADEK at the end of this\nterm. Yes, JOHN SLADEK, author of the\nSteam Driven Boy, Keep the Giraffe Burning,\nThe Muller-Focker Effect, the Reproducing\nMachine, The New Apocrypha and Roderick.\nAnd now an extract from a Vladivar Vodka\nAd.\nWell, we're coming to the end now, so we'll say\ngoodbye. Goodbye.\nThe Gunslinger's Osteopath\nJohn (the man without a nickname) Chamberlain\nKen (the man without qualities) Mann, and\nYetta (Swordmistress of Chaos).\nAll items in bold contain information.\nPatrick Moore\nwill speak to Astrosoc\non\nThe Planet Mars6:30 pm Friday, February 27\nin Physics LT1\nBE THERE!\nAmnesty\nInternational\nEARLIER THIS MONTH, the IC Amnesty International Group learnt that its adopted\nprisoner Ngimbi Mbaki was released from jail in\nZaire. He was arrested in March 1980, probably\nfor attending illegal meetings or for belonging to\nan illegal political party. It should be noted that\nopposition political parties are banned under the\nZairean constitution. He was not charged nor\nbrought to trial, although detention without\ncharge or trial is supposedly restricted to five\ndays, and Amnesty International have reason to\nbelieve that political prisoners in Zaire are\nroutinely ill-treated and beaten.\nAs he was the adopted prisoner of the College's Group, letters were written to senior government\nofficials in Zaire requesting further information\nand asking them to look into the matter, and the\ncampaign, which was carried out together with an\nAmnesty Group in Austria, was ended when\nnews was received of his release. Last year the\nGroup had two adopted prisoners released from\nZimbabwe and Indonesia.\nAnyone who is interested in the Amnesty\nInternational Organisation, is welcome at the\nweekly meeting on Tuesday, 5:30pm in the Green\nCommittee Room, top floor of the Union Building.\nFEUX, February 27,1981 Page 7\n\n"
