You see,\nwe are the-people who gave you a little\ncard at the beginning of term saying:' Nightline, someone to talk to.) and we put up posters around college carrying the\nsame Sort of message. Now it might not\nbe clear to everybody what there is to\ntalk about to this \" Nightline'. What is\nNightline anyway? \u2022\nWell, we are a group of students who\nthink it is important that there is a place around college with a friendly\natmosphere where you can come at any\ntime of the night and talk to another\nstudent about anything, where you are not being preached at, and\" where everything you say is kept completely confidential. Do not think that you have to be\nsuicidal to go to Nightline because that\nis simply not true. Although Nightline\nstarted as an emergency service, we find\nnow people in all sorts of moods and\nwith all sorts of problems come in or\nphone up. Other people just want some\ninformation or a cup of coffee. The other thing you might want to know\nIB\"-what sort of person is a Nightline\nvolunteer. Well we are all students, but\nthat is about the only generalisation you can give about Nightline volunteers.\nVolunteers are selected for their ability\nto listen and be friendly. The on Ty other\nthing they have in common is that'they\nwill all offer you a cup of coffee if you\ndrop in\nNew address\nOver the summer vacation Nightline\nmoved from no. 8 Princes Gardens to no.>\n10 Princes Gardens-, so when you drop\nin you might find us still in a bit of a mess. But once everything is ready it\nshould look very smart.\nVolunteers\nThe last thing I forgot to tel.I you is?\nthat Nightline has got large information\nfiles about anything you might possibly\nwant information on Doctors, Abortion\nclinics, Accommodation, etc., I hope that cleared up the picture a little but if you want to know now you are always welcome to drop in or phone\n(Internal 2468, External5812468). G. Nieuwenhuijis\nNightline Director\n\u2014 \u2022 COLLEGE NOTICES \u2014\nThe Orienteering Club is one of the\nnewest college clubs, but already it is\none of the most active. This term, we\nwill be taking part in Orienteering\nEvents nearly every Sunday in forests in\nthe South of England. We usually travel\nby minibus, leaving fairly early on\nSunday morning, and getting back about\nmid-afternoon.\nOrienteering is a sport that should\nappeal to anyone with a pair of legs and a liking for the country-side. There are\nalways a variety of courses varying in\nlength between 2 and 8 miles, 'so you can\nchoose the course you prefer. Whether\nyou are strolling round, or running round,\nit is best to try a short course the first\ntime and move up as you gain experience.\nNavigation just as important as speed\nFor those who don't yet know what the\nsport involves, the idea is to make one's way round a set' of checkpoints in the\nforest in the shortest time using map and\ncompass. The checkpoints consist of red\nand white markers hung on some feature\neg a spur, a path junction^and one chooses\none's own route between them. To do well,\nnavigation is just as important as speed.\nTo find out more about the sport,\ncome along to our Friday lunchtime\nmeetings, held regularly in the Senior\nCommon Room ( Union First Floor).\nAt these meetings, a cheap bread and\ncheese lunch is provided, and transport\nfor forthcoming events is arranged.\nDavid Rosen (Captain)\nAstronomy Group : Int 4458\nSECURITY NEWS\nThe attention of Students, particularly now arrivals to the\nCollege, is drawn to the services provided by the security staff\nand students should not hesitate to contact the Security Officer,\nRoom 763, Sherfield Building, internal telephone number 2741\nregarding any security matter and in particular anything concerning the following:-Lost Property\nEvery year hundreds of items of personal property are found\nand handed In at the Security Office \u2014 many such items are never\nclaimed by the losers and eventually are returned to the finders.\nStudents and Staff who lose property should promptly inform the\nsecurity staff and in many cases the items will be speedily\nrestored. Persons finding items of personal property should\nhand them in to the Security Office or to one of the messengers\nor security guards on any of the buildings.\nThefts\nIt Is an unfortunate fact of life that, on an open campus such\nas this where a very large number of people are allowed\nconsiderable freedom of access, periodical spates of stealing\noccur. A good deal of this is due to the incursions of 'walk in'\nthieves who prey on institutions such as this and on the museums,\nseveral of which are in close proximity to the College. Both\nStudents and Staff are requested to co-operate with security\nstaff by promptly reporting to the Security Officer any suspicious\npersons seen loitering in college buildings or entering offices or\nlaboratories with no apparent authority. Wallets, cash, Cheque\nbooks, calculators, slide rules, watches are the things most\ncommonly stolen and they should never be left in jackets or\nbrief cases In unattended rooms, in particular, cheque books and\ncheque cards should always be carried separately on the person\n\u00a3S Instances have occurred where heavy withdrawals of cash\nIrom banks have been made through thieves having obtained\npossession of both card and cheque book.\nPedal cycles are currently very attractive to thieves and it\nbrought on to the campus they should be secured to the cycle\nrack with a heavy chain and stout padlock. Plastic covered\ncables of the kind purchased in cycle shops provide little\ndeterrent to thieves and should not be used. If you value your\ncycle please insure it.\nCar Parking\nUnless you have been authorised to park your car on the\ncampus do not bring it into the College car park otherwise you\nwill inconvenience some person who has an authorised parking\nplace. Derelict vehicles are also'from time to time an embarrassment to the College and any vehicle which ceases to be roa o worthy should be disposed of by the owner and not left on the\ncar park where it may quickly be cannibal is ed by persons who\nare quick to recognise that it has been abandoned. Motor cycles\nbrought into the College must be registered with the Security\nOfficer and Students are requested to park only in the authorised\nparking spaces. Parking in between motor vehicles can result in\ndamage to both cars and motor cycles.\nLanguage classes\nWeekly classes in French, German and Russian will be held\nthroughout the session 1976\u201477. They are open, free of charge,\nto all members of Imperial College and provide for three levels\nof attainment:\nElementary \u2014 for complete beginners. (Two periods of 1 hour\nper week).\nIntermediate \u2014for students who have previously completed at\nleast a year's course in the language. (One period\n1^ hours per week).\nAdvanced \u2014for students who have already followed the\nIntermediate course or who have reached a standard corresponding to an ' O' level pass.\n(One period of IVi hours per week).\nEnrolment\n\"\" If you wish to enrol for these classes get in touch with Mrs\nCampion in the Associated Studies office (53 Prince's Gate,\ninternal 3958) between 9.30 and 12.00 noon any weekday.\n\n"

    "content": "12 - FELIX, OCTOBER15 th1976 THE SHOOT IS T( Paramount, A) directed by Don Siegel; starring John Wayne\nand Lauren Baca Ii with James Stewart,\nRichard Boone and Hugh O' Brian. Don Siegel' s latest film, The Shoe-list,\nis a simple one in that the storyline is\nsimple, the morality of it is simple and, it\nis simply and effectively done. And like\nall simple things it is good; in fact very\ngood indeed. Siegel' s treatment of the\nfilm turns a potential weepy into an\nentertaining and at times quite funny\nfilm.\nThe film is set at the turn of the\ncentury. On the day everybody is mourning\nQueen Victoria's death, JB Brooks\n(played with authority and presence by\nJohn Wayne) rides into Carson City, Anyone remotely interested in gym-nas tics, musical comedy or philosophy\nshould hasten to the Lyttelton Theatre to\nsee the revival of Tom Stoppard's Jumpers. Even if none of these tickles your fancy then I can guarantee that you\nwill not be bored by this stupendous\nproduction. Mr Stoppard's talent for\nwitty paradox and double entendre\nsucceeds a hundred times over.\nWho, but Mr Stoppard could have\nconceived the character of George\nMoore, Professor of moral philosophy,\nlovingly brought to life by Michael\nHordern? George, the only member of the\nUniversity Philosophy faculty who\ndoesn't take part in the acrobatics\norganised by the Vice Chance I lor, (Sir\nArchibald Jumper MD, D Phil, DL it t,LD, DPM, D PT( Gym).)devotes his talents to\nattempting practical demonstrations of\nZeno' s paradoxes, by shooting an arrow\nat a target and by racing a tortoise\nagainst a hare.\nMeanwhile his wife, Dorothy, a famous musical comedy star, played by\nJulie Covington, remains enticing ly in\nher bedroom with the body of the Professor of Logic. Dorothy has retired\nfrom the stage since Man landed on the\nMoon (yet another facet of Mr Stoppard's lunar obsession and passes the day\ncreating elaborate charades and watching\na small television whose screen is blown\nup on the back wall for the audience's benefit.)\nWhilst the play contains numerous\nmoments of effective theatricality it\nlacks any coherent thread; instead the\naudience is kept going by the expectation,\nfully satisfied, of the next coup de theatre. There is stunning acrobatics from\na team of yellow suited Jumpers and\nMiss Covington's singing of the Moon\nsongs is excellent.\nAlso at the Lyttelton are Howard\nBrenton's Weapons of Happiness and\nNoel Coward's Blithe Spirit. In the first\nMr Brenton successfully depicts the\ntakeover of a South London crisp factory by a particularly inept group of\nyouths led by an idealistic girl hankering\nafter a Marxist society. The play is\nfirmly rooted to reality by flashbacks to\nEastern Europe in the fifties and by the\ncharacter of Josef Frank (Frank Finlay) who has escap ted from Czechoslovakia where he was Assistant Secretary of the\nCommunist Party, and come to ground at\nmmm\nWayne legend fights on\nNevada. He goes to see h[s friend Doc\nHostetler (James Stewart) who confirms\nhis worst fears. He, Brooks, is suffering\nfrom terminal cancer.\nDetermined to make the town his last resting place he takes a room in\nMrs Rogers' (played by Laurne Bacall)\nhouse by deceiving her that he is\nWilliam Hick cock. When she discovers to\nher chagrin and anger that he has duped\nher she demands that he leaves but he\ndoes not. He does not even do so when\nthe town's pompous and windbag of as her riff orders him to. However, the snivelling s her riff's fears give way to cock-a hoop delight\nwhen Brooks tells him that he (Brooks) is\ndying. Marshall Thibido is so pleased\nthat when he visits Brooks the next day\nfollowing a shoot-out between Brooks and\nhis two would-be killers, he is moved to\nask Brooks how poorly he is. He is not the only one. The undertaker,\nspying Brooks in the barbershops drops\nin to do business and finds himself\ndeprived of 50 dollars as investment,\nthe barber too, is not a bad businessman,\nhe sweeps up Brooks' hair and a bit more\nbesides in order to sell locks of it\nwhen Brooks dies. Brooks does not keep them waiting\nlong. Before he is shot in the back by\nthe bartender (his third eye finally\nfailed him) he eliminates three of the\ntown's more un savoury characters. As he\nsays, he never shot a man who did not\ndeserve it.\nA well tempo ed film that never slacks in pace and is t anti Using to the last.\nIt is well worth a visit. Witty Stoppard has second\nJumpers succes\nlast in the crisp factory. What could\ncontrast more with Weapons of Happiness\nthan Blithe Spirit? Noel Coward's wartime\npiece on death is given a spirited\nperformance by a cast that includes\nElizabeth Spriggs as Madame Arc at i. The play transfers to the Olivier in the\nautumn.\nDonkeys' Years is a new Michael\nFrayn comedy set at an Oxbridge College reunion. Twenty years on the old students\nreturn to renew acquaintance and refresh\ntheir memories of the happiest days of\ntheir lives. Penelope Keith has earned\nthe soubriquet of \" The funniest woman in\nthe West End\", for her performance which\ndidn't quite live up to the expectations\nformed from the BBC's Good Life series. The reason that The Family Dance is proving so popular is that its cast is so terrific. Alec McCowen and Michael\nBryant head a cast which, according to\none review, could make the London\ntelephone directory a smash hit. The play\nis the usual run of the mill piece about\nmiddle-age envy of youth and is drawing\nAmericans like flies to fly-paper.\nThomas Stevenson\nDespite present weather conditions the Thames\nWater Authority and College authorities still say\u2014\nDON'T WASTE WATER\nThere is still a shortage and every drop count. This\nparticularly applies to students in College ac com moda tion; the TWA has obtained powers under the Drought\nAct to enforce water restrictions and has asked IC to\nsubstantially cut its water wastage. Please make a conscious effort to help eco no mise. Jl\nT SHIRTS now available from\nthe Felix office only \u00a31.50\nThere are still a whole host of attractive FELIX\nT Shirts available, in a multitude of colour combinations\nand sizes to fit everyone - well almost. At \u00a31.50\n(in cl VAT) they represent excellent value for money.\n\n"

    "content": "16 - FELIX, OCTOBER15 th1976 Societies\nPage\nTM Society\nDaydreaming,\nin the fourth\nconscious state\nTranscendental Mediation (TM) was\nbrought to the West seventeen years ago\nby Maharishi Mahesh Yogi with the aim\nof unfolding the full potential of the\nindividual through the development of a fourth major state of consciousness. The\nthree states of consciousness regularly\navailable are waking, sleeping,.. nd\ndreaming; each one characterized\nobjectively by different physiological correlates.. Scientific research on TM as well as subjective experience shows\nthat a fourth major state of consciousness is inherent in our neuro-physiology \u2014 a state of restful alertness; restful because\nwithin a few minutes after starting the\nJj H HUH technique, the body gains a state of\nrest that is almost twice as deep as that\nof deep sleep, (releasing deep stresses and tensions), while the mind, instead of\nfalling asleep, actually increases in\nalertness and wakefulness. Electric e ncep halo graphic research shows an\nintegration and synchro ny of brain wave\nactivity between different parts of the\nbrain which does not occur to such an\nextended coherence in the other states\nof consciousness. The integration gained\nduring TM, as the med it at or experiences\nrefined levels of mental activity, carries\non into the day and accumulates over time\nto benefit the individual. Results are:\nIncreased energy and creative intelligence, more inner stability, happiness, improved\nhealth, and the full development of the\nmind and body in the state of Enlighten ment.\nThe TM technique is practiced 15/20\nminutes twice a day sitting comfortably\nin a chair with the eyes closed. Without\nrequiring any s pec ia 1 setting or preparation,\nit is a purely mental technique which\ndoes not necessitate any change in faith,\nlife sy tle, or diet; it does not involve as y concentration, or effort. It is completely\nnatural, and uses what is already inherent\nwithin us.\nLORD MAYOR'S SHOW Any Guildsmen or women who want\nto help work on the float will be welcome\nto join the procession on Saturday, 13th November. Those interested should come\nto the next C&G Union meeting, or\ncontact Jane Dracoft and Claire Stevens\nin Civ Eng II.\nGliding Club\nCheap glide\nto success\nThe club was founded in 1929 as the\ngliding movement began to form in\nEngland. During the early thirties the\nclub lived at Dunstable with the London\nGliding Club. After the war the club reformed at Redhill with the Surrey\nGliding club, and has remained with this\nclub to the present day. The clubs now\nshare the facilities of the La sham Gliding Society, at La sham Airfield near Basing stoke.\nI CGC has 3 single-seat gliders, aK.a^8 for early solo, a Skylark IV for early\ncross-country flying and a new Astir CS for advanced pilots. Training\nThe training of our pilots is done by\nthe La sham Society, initially on motor\ngliders moving on to two-seater gliders\nwhen the basic handling techniques have\nbeen learnt.\nThe college club is a very cheap way\nto learn to glide, and also, as it is a small club, a very friendly club. Most students\ntake about 2 terms to go solo, going\ndown to Lasham every other weekend.\nWe have pilots of all standards in the\nclub, including ex-students. In fact the\nthird position in this year's world\nchampionships standard class was taken\nby George Burton, an ex-student.\nIf you are interested come along, to Aero Engineering room 254 on any\nThursday at 6 pm. Judo Club\nAncient art is now fine all-round exercise\nMuch mystery and confusion surrounds\nthe sport of judo. The gentle art of\njudo was devised in 1882 by Dr Jigoro\nKano, who founded the Kodokan School\nIn Tokyo. Kano's ideas incorporated\nmany of the ancient jiu-jitsu techniques,\nbut his wish was to create a relatively\nsafe and healthy pursuit for the youth of\nJapan and the rest of the world.\nJudo can be regarded from two different\nview points \u2014 the first self defence and\nthe second, sport. The confusion between\nthese two in the west arose from its\nbeing taught to army and police personnel\nprimarily tor self defence and the way it\nis used in many films. This is not to say\nthat the exponents of so or tiu do would not\nbe at an advantage should they need to\ndefend themselves.\nJudo is a line all-round exercise tor\npeople of all ages, developing body-mind coordination, patience, consideration,\nstrength and endurance: Sei Ryoko Zen Yo \u2014 the full and most beneficial use of\nall the faculties (Jigoro Kano). It can\nbe divided into several groups of techniques \u2014 Osaekomiwaza (holding), Newaza\n(grappling), Tachniwaza (throwing),\nShimewaza (strangling) and Kansetsuwaza\n(arm-locking). The art of striking (Atemi-waz a) is not included in sport judo.\nThe Club at IC\nThe IC Judo Club, for both men and\nwomen, is one of the most active London\nUniversity clubs, having a large mat\n(over 850 sq ft) and 1st Dan black belt\ntuition. The club meets in the gym of the\nUnion in Prince Consort Road on Tuesdays\nand Thursdays from 6.30 to 8.00. Gradings\nare held regularly at the University of\nLondon Union and at the Budokwai (one\nof Europes leading clubs). The usual\nevening consists ot a warm-up period,\nfalling practice (Ukemi), throwing\npractice (Uchikomi) \u2014where the techniques\nare polished, a taught section with\nrelated practice and finally Randori or\nfree practice. The evening ends with\nloosening-up exercises, a warm shower\nand some social ising in the downstairs\nbar. Beginners are welcome at this club,\nand tor those who are more experienced\nthere is also the opportunity to practise\nat one of London's many non-university\nestablishments.\nIt is hoped this year that some inter-college evenings can be arranged and\nthat the club will continue to be a lively\nand friendly one.\nThere is also a black belt coach tor\nAikido. a very graceful and powerful\nform of self defence; again it is for both\nmen and women.\nPresident: George McGavin (589 6323 ext\n364)\nTreasurer: Tony Hall Physics2& Secretary\nCoaches: Andy Phillips, Jeff Walker\nAikido coach: Maurice.\n\n"

However, the\n1CEnts committee have been offered the Groovies on11 th December, but no final contracts have yet been signed. It looks very likely that Split Enz (reviewed in the last\nFelicity) will be headlining here on 27th November. So far the\nband have only played a handful of gigs and the IC date will probably be the first time they've headlined in London. Not to\nbe missed.

    "content": "6 - FELIX, OCTOBER15 th1976 Food, food, glorious food!\nIC is situated in the heart of London's entertainment world.\nWithin a mere ten pence bus ride of College exists every\npossible form of entertainment; films, strip-shows, discos,\nwomen's colleges, plays and food. The variety provided by the\nlatter is endless and a three year systematic attack on it is\nwell within the pocket of any student. This \"tour de cuisine\"\ncan and should turn the \"fish fingers * \u2022 ' peas merchant\" into\nan \"international\" gastronome.\nGenuine alternatives\nYou have or will at some stage tackle and suffer(?) the\ndelights (sic?) thrown up by the College refectories (ie Mooney's). You may be wondering if there are any genuine alternatives, to\nMooney, in price and distance from College. Well there are!!\nAnd not a million miles from here either, to quote a past\npresident of the Union. The Stockpot (10 minutes walk from Southside) in Basil Street (behind Knightsbridge tube), provides the competition.\nA typical main course costs between 33p \u2014 65p and includes\nchips and one other vegetable. Chicken casserole at 60pisa good value for money dish. For the \" real\" student Curried\nEggs at 35p is more reasonable and Spaghetti Bolognese at 33p( without vegetables) knocks spots off Mooney. The quality at\nthe Stockpot can be judged by its executive clientele. There\nis a wide range of deserts but unless you're pretty starved we\nwould suggest you lay off them since they are slightly on the\nexpensive side (18p plus). The Stockpot is shut on Sundays,\nbut open on weekdays till10 pm. Good55 p filler\nAlso in the same price 'bracket are the Chelsea Kitchen( which serves huge helpings of salad); The New Hotpot (near\nThe Bolton s, a pub frequented by gays); Hotpot (good for\nmoussa ka), a good filler for55 p; The Pot with its quite,\nun rushed atmosphere; and the Golden Pot. Incidentally, all the pots are on or off Earl's Court Road. One of the main\nfeatures of these places is the quickness of service. For \u00a31\nyou get a satisfying three course meal. Distinctive Disaster\nFor about \u00a31.50 you can get bloated on a quarter pound\nhamburger and chips plus a tray of delicious relish and a milk\nshake. GAD( the Great American Disaster) the most distinctive of the group in Beauchamp Place is the best. It serves a cool, thick and refreshing milkshake and whilst waiting for your meal\nyou can peruse past front pages of The New York Times recounting such epic tales as the Lindberg crossing, the Titanic and\nWorld War two.\nThe Great American Success (GAS) (on High Street Ken opposite the tube station) with its hot panted waitresses is open all night. Strikes (the nearest one is in Gloucester Road near Waitrose) and the Great British Success( GBS) are the\npoor brother and expensive rip p off relations of GAD respectively.\nThe nearest GB S is also in Gloucester Road opposite the tuber\nstation. The latest taped American imports (records you fools)\n,are used as background music in all these joints.\nHot V mild\nThose with a robust constitution and an adventurous taste\ncan sample a wide variety of Asian food at a modest price within the locality. Our favourite hideout is a Bangle dish restaurant\ncalled the Curry Palace in Gloucester Road. The papa dom, a giant crs ip to be sprinkled with paprika helps to while away the\ntime till your meal arrives. Bhoonakeema is the best mild\nmeat dish whereas meat v in da loo is the best hot curry they\ndo. Don't miss one of their vegetable dishes, in particular,\nmushrooms and also the onion b hagee. Try and avoid the mango\nchutney when the relish tray is brought round-you could be in for a loo-bound day! Get pally with the waiters for big helpings!\nThe decor is plain, simple and reflects the country of origin. A foreign speciality to this restaurant is the strong German\nDortmunder Bier. Other restaurants in the Curry Palace league (\u00a32\u2014\u00a33) are the\nHussein in South Ken for Arab dishes; the Soraya opposite The Gloucester public house and a Turkish kebab house opposite\nJohn Menzies in Old Brompton Road. Unfortunately, and to our\ngreat regret, there are no Chinese restaurants in this price\nprice bracket; there is however, a Vietnamese restaurant at the\n\"north end of Gloucester Road. Most of these restaurants do\ntakeaways.\nFranco-Italian artistry\nAt \u00a32.50\u2014\u00a34.00, including house carafe wine, exists an extensive range of French and Italian restaurants ( Bistros, Bi sting os, etc) dotted all over South Ken and the surrounding\nareas. These provide the artistry associated with Franco Italian food and more often than not in a pleasant atmosphere.\nThere is little between these; explore them and find the one\nthat suits your taste.\nLuscious trout\nThe 13'/2 Cantina Marchigiana is at 13 Beauchamp Place. Price wise it is slotted between the Bristros and the up market\nrestaurants. A cosy little one-roomed family outfit, the 13l/2 has\na distinctive character. The food cooked by the mother is served by the father, his son and a couple of waiters. Avocados with prawns, l'escar got au gratin, melon, can nell on i and other\npasta dishes are just a few choice selections from their extensive\nentree list. Sumptious, mouth-watering trout bathed in a house\nwhite wine, mushroom sauce and to be drunk with the same vino\nis an un forget able experience of ec stacy. The Mediteranean flavour of the decor is portrayed by both\nthe Italian wine bottles on all sides of the room and the Italian\nfamily spirit. The quite background music is conducive to\nstimulating conversation/This atmosphere is ideal for developing\nan acquaintance.\nTake your time over choosing a main course - the waiters\ntake delight in explaining the differences between the various\ncourses. The truly great dishes are those served under the\nhouse name. This is also true of the deserts especially crepe\nmarch i gian a, which is a pancake filled with fresh cream and a dash of li quer. If by this time your not well and truly satiated,\nthen try one of their gate aux s from the trolley (De Tartare\nsays you're a better man than he). This feast, not to be scorned\neven by a king, will only set you back \u00a33.50 a head and includes\ncarafe wine.\nSeduction\nThe expensive meal for those special occasions must have\nthe restaurant carefully chosen. It must appeal to the character\nof the people being entertained, particularly in the atmosphere\nthey provide. For a boisterous evening try the Bortchsh ' n' Tears in Beauchamp Place. Le Chalet in Campden Hill Road off High Street Ken is the perfect setting for an evening of seduction.\n(Come equipped with a thick wallet and make sure you're on to\na certainty before you set out.)\nUnsavoury, but..,\nBack to the basic requirements of a hun grey student, we\nnote but do not recommend the following un savoury establishments, the Pizza lands, Wimpys and Kentucky s. Takeaway\ndoner kebab are substantially better value for money and tastier.\nDuring the coming year we intend frequenting various eating\nhouses including several of those already mentioned and\ncommenting on each one in FELIX at regular intervals. We\nwelcome any suggestions and comments on any restaurants\nyou may come across. Here's to wine, women and song.\nThe Stockpot, 6 Basil Street, SW3\nChelsea Kitchen, 98 King's Road SW3\nThe Hotpot, 6 Kenway Road, SW5\nThe New Hot Pot, Earl's Court Road, SW5\nThe Pot, 5a Hogarth Place, SW5\nThe Golden Pot, off Hogarth Place, SW5\nGreat American Disaster, 9 Beauchamp Place, SW3\n355 Fulham Road, SW10\nGreat American Success, 100 Kensington High Street, W8\nGreat Brithsh Success, Gloucester Road, SW7 (opp tube station)\nThe Hussein, Thurloe Place, SW7\nBistro Vino, 1 Old Brompton Road, SW7\nLe Bistingo, 56 Old Brompton Road, SW7\nMcHaggis and De Tartare\n\n"

    "content": "Soccer\nIC help England scrape\na victory\nEngland 2 v Imperial College1 On Sunday Imperial College once again served as sparring\npart ne fs for Don Re vie's England\nteam, in preparation for their\nmatch against Finland on\nWednesday. In a splendid\nmatch IC performed magnificently\nand despite world class opposition were only defeated by a single goal.\nInjuries\nSince the England squad\nwas severely hit by injuries,\nthey could field only nine men\nfor this match and in order to\ncomplete the eleven IC's Pat Frampton and Welshman (!)\nGareth Roberts made their\nEngland debuts. Kev Allen and Dave Finn is also won their\nfirst caps by sharing the\nresponsibility of keeping\ngoal for Don Re vie's team.\nIn goal for IC was a promising\nyoungster by the name of\nPeter Shilton, who, despite\nhis obvious nerves in the\nearly stages, settled down and\nhad a fine game.\nControversial\nPlay was very even throughout the first half and despite\nFrampton hitting the cross bar\nIC prevented England from\ngetting any clear cut chances. However, mid-way through\nthe first half Mick Mills was put through by a long pass and\nshot past the advancing Shilton\nto put England one up. Nevert he less, IC came back into the\ngame and nearly equalized\nwhen a Steve Bates drive was well saved by Kev Allen. A few minutes before half time\nEngland scored their second, somewhat controversial goal. Gordon Hill worked a beautiful\none-two with Charlie George\nand, although looking sus-pi cio us ly offside, slammed\nthe ball into the back of the\nnet.\nIC determination pays off\nSo IC began the second half\ntwo goals down but they\ncontinued to play with great\ndetermination, and by sheer\nhard work refused to wilt under\npressure. In fact, IC themselves\nbegan to look dangerous with\nsome neat passing in midfield\nwhich brought about some good\nbreakaway attacks. Then, in\nthe last minute, IC finally got\nthe goal they deserved. The ball was centred from a corner\nkick, Paul Heidn shot and\nFinn is parried it, he shot\nagain and the ball rebounded\noff the post, eventually Heidn\nshot for a third time and the\nball flew into the back of the\nnet, 2\u20141. The final whistle\nwent before England could\nrestart the game and so ended\na pulsating match in which IC\nput up a splendid, all-round\nteam performance which is\nfully reflected in the score line.

    "content": "Many of you, second and third years\nas well as fresher s, may be asking \" what is external affairs.\"? The purpose of\nthis column over the coming weeks is to\nattempt to answer that question and also to inform and stimulate discussion on\nexternal affairs. External Affairs i \u00bb\nmainly concerned with other student\nbodies in the UK \u2014 co-operating on\nmatters of common interest, taking part\nin and influencing decisions taken by\ncorporate student organisations. At present, apart from individual student\nunions, the main areas of activity are\nwithin the National Union of Students,\nthe University of London Union and the\nLondon Students Organisation (the last\nsubject to possibly change at the next\nUGM). Over the next few weeks I intend\nto explain the aims and organisation of\nthese three, together with a few notes on\nthe political groups within student politics. One-of the most controversial bodies is\nthe NUS,a confederation of independent\nstudent unions. NUS is the only national\nstudents organisation, although there are a significant number of unions not in\nmembership. TheN US aims to represent\nstudent interests nationally and also to\nassist student unions. In some cases it\nassists individual students with problems\nthey may have. To this end it maintains\na large staff centered at En sleigh St\nLondon together with field officers\nscattered throughout Britain. NUS also runs a large travel service\n(currently running at a very big loss), an\ninsurance brokerage (Endsleigh), a marketing service and a printing firm (all\nmaking a slight profit).\nNUS policy\nThe policy of the union is decided by\ntwo conferences every year, one at the\nend of this term and the other during the\neaster vacation. The policy is carried out\nExternal Affairs:\nNUS-a brief\nguide\nunder the direction of an executive of\nseventeen, including four full time\nofficers (earning about \u00a32500 pa) all elected at the. Easter conference. Every\nunion in membership has the right to\nsend delegates to the conferences but\nless than half in fact do so, despite\nthe introduction of a conference subsidy\nfund. One delegate is sent for every\nthousand or part of a thousand full time\nstudents in a union. ICU therefore send\nfive delegates as well as three observers.\nAt the present day conferences reports\nfrom the executive on the execution of\nprevious mandates are received and\npolicies on subjects ranging from the\nnext years grant claim to the Angolan\nciv iI war are decided. Broad Left dominate NUS The problem with the NUS is that it\nis seen to be out of touch with the\nordinary student and dominated by the\nultra-left wing by conventional political\nstandards. At the moment the NUS executive consists of fifteen members of\nthe Broad Left - a mixture of Communists\nand left wing labour \" students\", an\nInternational Marxist (ultra-ultra-left\nwing), and a member of the Federation of\nConservative Students - the first to\nbe elected for several years. The main\nreason for this total domination of the\nNUS by one particular group is the\nun demo crt rti c nature of the conference\nFELIX, October 15th1976 S and the method of election of the\nexecutive.\nThe delegates to conference emerge\nfrom their unions by many methods; some,\nlike u s,elect them by campus wide\nballot or from aUG M, others send\ndelegates ex-off cio( ie President,\nExternal Affairs VP), and at some\ncolleges the delegates are appointed\nby the union executive. Undemocratic elections\nThese delegates, who must be\nactivists just to attend conference, then\nelect the executive in a fairly undemocratic\nelection. Over the last year their have\nbeen attempts to bring in direct elections of at least some members of the executive. Not s uprising ly the Broad Left were,\nand still are, unwilling to give up\ncontrol of the NUS to students.\nAt present the policy of IC Union is that we recognise that the NUS is undemocratic, and that drastic steps are needed\nto change its structure. ICU feels that\na working party should be set up to\ninvestigate this more thoroughly.\nThis year ICU will pay about55008 to\nNUS in affiliation fees.\nOn home ground\nThe External Affairs committee has a number of vacancies for which nomination\npapers are now up in the Lower Lounge. If anyone feels the desire to get involved\nin the union through external affairs\neither contact me through the union\noffice or just stick your name on a nomination paper.\nHugh Barrett\nExternal Affairs Officer\n(Ed's note: The views expressed in credited FELIX articles are those of their au th ors. They do not necessarily reflect those\nof the FELIX staff or those of its Editor.)\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX, OCTOBER15 th197613 Rctdio On\u00a9\nChart followers not pace setters\n\u00bb \u00ab\n\"We have with u.s in the studio today the celebrated\nMrs Florence Cruddy.\"\nRadio One is the newest BBC network and also the one with the\nlargest audience figures. It started at the\nend of September 1976 soon after the\npirates were made illegal and was an obvious copy of their style. It was formed by splitting the Light Programme\nwhich was on long wave, medium wave\nand VHF into Radio One and Two; Radio One getting the medium wavelength\nmaking it the only BBC network not on VHF, a situation which still exists. Since then Radio One has come a long\nway although it still has rather restricted\nhours of separate programming\nPersonality station\nRadio One is essentially a personality\nstation as opposed to most commercial\nstations which concentrate on the\nmusic. One of the major personalities\nis Noel Edmonds who presents the\nbreakfast show every weekday morning\nfrom 7 am until 9 am. Noel reached\nthis top show via a highly successful Sunday Morning show on Radio One and\nRadio Luxembourg. FELIX asked him\nhow he saw his role as a breakfast time\nDJ;'/ see my job as essentially being a bright and breezy link between the\nmusic, personality injections between the\nmusic conveying information,but generally\njust trying to smooth the whole thing\nalong'.\nChoice and variety missing\nNoel's music is chosen from a playlist by his producer, the only effect he has\non it is through choosing his record of\nthe week and influencing the producer.\nRadio One music is generally chart\nmusic, which Noel described as 'across\nthe board good music' although he does\nhave misgivings about this policy:7 don't believe that any station should be\ntied to a chart, because it almost\nsuggests you're following the public. I reckon a really successful station ought\nto lead the public. Give them the choice\nand variety. If you are tied totally to\nwhat a group of people is buying, I don't think that is a good thing'. Indeed\nsince the advert of British commercial\nradio, Radio One has been able to\nanswer criticism that it was not playing\na record that the producers did not\nbelieve suited the station.\n'Capital - a mess'\nWhat did Noel think of commercial\nradio and Capital in particular'. 7 think\nCapital is an awful mess although I listen to it a lot. I think that Capital is\na bit of a contradiction in a way. It's trying to be both a personality station\nand a music station at the same time'.\nHe thought that there was room for\nanother commercial station in London\nwhich could have a highly selective\npolicy, perhaps like Radio Caroline. Commercial radio has meant a drop in\nthe Radio One audience but not nearly\nas great as would be expected by the\ncommercial radio figures. This indicates\nthat commercial radio has to a large\nextent created it's own audience and\npromoted a new awareness in British radio; a situation that Noel is quite\npleased about (and he still has 8 million listeners!) Even with the attraction of\ncommercial radio Noel is very happy\nwhere he is and is not interested in\nmoving, he sees Radio One as close to\nhis ideal stat ron. Finally what changes would Noel\nlike to see? He would like to see a tighter station with its own charts and\nmore hours so they can broadcast until\nmidnight, after all Radio One is by\nfar the cheapest of the BBC networks\nto run.\nRADIO LONDON - TRUE LOCAL STATION\nContinued from page 8\nRadio London has always been a problem station since it is much larger\nthen any other local station (with a potential audience of nearly 11 million)\nbut run within the confines of local radio.\nThis problem became acutely obvious\nwhen the commercial stations opened and\nwere able very convincingly to beat\nRadio London in Audience ratings.\nEighteen months ago Alan Holden moved\nto Radio London from the highly success ful Radio Manchester and initiated a major re orientation of the station which has already resulted in at least doubling,\nif not trebling the audience figures \u2014 a remarkable achievement. I asked him what he was aiming for with the station.\nHe explained that Radio London is the\nonly mixed channel in London and he\ntries to attract a family audience,\nalthough not all at the same time. He\ntries to stress the local influence and\nconcentrates on local common denomination like education or transport rather\nthan parochial affairs. All this is covered\nwith as much gloss as possible as this is also a part of the London scene. He\nachieves this with a broadcast staff of\naround 40 people \u2014 quite a task.\nRare breed .\nTo see the station is action I visited Susie Barnes'' Rush Hour' programme one\nmorning and saw their two new studios\nin action,( Alan Holden described the\ndifference between these and their old studies as 'like driving an Alfa Romeo\nafter driving a Ford Poplar'). Susie was\nin one studio where she operated the\njingle machines and records whilst news, interviews and outside items\ncame from the other studio. This arrangement allowed Susie to have considerable\ncontrol over the 'sound' of her programme\nwithout having to operate everything\nherself.\nSusie is one of the rare breed of\nbroadcasters who started right at the\nbottom. She joined the BBC, at Broadcasting House, as a secretary to a secretary and came to Radio London in1970 via the old Light Programme and Radio1 and 2 whe ee she was a production\nassistant. In her ' Rush Hour' programme Susie\ntries to present news and information in an entertaining way, providing an alternative to all other stations which are either hard news or solid music. Another way that it provides an alternative is by having a woman present or.( In fact whilst I was there it was almost\na female takeover, with a woman panel\noperator in the other studio, a woman\ntraffic reporter, a weather woman and a woman news reader) I wondered whether\nSusie had found it difficult to be in essen ci ally a man's world but she stressed that everyone on the station\nwas employed on their merits as a broadcaster; as far as the public was concerned she had had very little\nadverse reaction to her presenting the\nbreakfast time show. A major feature of local radio,\nparticularity in London, is the phone-in\nprogrammes, which are used on this\nstation. These programmes have been\nmuch crit is ed but they do get some of the station's best audience figures\nAlan Holden likes to structure these\nprogrammes more than most other stations,\nas he feels that this is when they are\nmost useful and constructive; he also thinks it essential to have a 'major\nability' presenting the show.\n'Radio London is the real local radio\nin London' is how Alan Holden summed\nup the whole station.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX, OCTOBER15 th197615 Wimbledon magic flat\nsecond time round\nRocket Cottage - Steeleye Span\n(Chrysalis CHR1123) I was rather looking forward to this LP since their last effort, (whose title I can't mention because of the competition)\nspanned the void between folk and rock\nremarkably well. Produced by Womble\nMike Batt the album was excellent and\nwon them many new friends, although\nlosing a few old traditionalists, who\nfelt they'd gone too far with their up-tempo\narrangements.\nNow, with Rocket Cottage, Span have\ngone too far for even me to rave about.\nFolk devotees have played it too have\nbeen shocked. At points good lyrics\nhave been sacrificed to a inept commercial\narrangement, at others, such as Orfeo/\nNathan's Reel the treatment is too\ncasual and flimsy that I got the feeling\nSteeleye were getting insincere about\ntheir music.\nMy main criticisms must be vented on\n'The Twelve Witches' and 'Sir John The\nRose'. The former has a mella tron intro\nand interludes that are just too bland for\nthis sort of music. The latter takes up a major chunk of the second side. It has\nonly a twinkling of folk, the rest is\npunk rock and commercial it y. The excellent lyrics (traditional) .depict a sad Scottish tale \u2014 I wonder if the\nRollers will do a cover version? With a different producer this may have come\noff well; as it is it smacks too much of\nthe. worse end of the hit parade,, the\nchorus especially. On the other\" hand the vamped up\njig 'Sligo Maid' comes across well\nbut it won't please traditional folk fans.\nSUMS However, for my part I felt the commanding\nrhythm and enthralling violin into n nations held the track together extremely well. Having got the bodies out the way, a few words on the better songs. My\nfavourite is 'Fighting for Strangers'\n(chorus music 'To Be A Pilgrim') which\nassesses the motivation behind a nineteenth century soldier, painting a rueful picture of the limbless victims of\nmanmade strife. A very perceptive\ntreatment indeed. 'The Brown Girl' is\nanother good number. Its main point is\nthe strong, versatile and enigmatic vocal\ntreatment of Moddy Prior, who pounds\nliterally through this 'love tr ad ged y'. Tight instrumental work lets you glide\nthrough the song's contrasting moods.\nAbove ordinary and quite enthralling \u2014 I wish there were more tracks like it on the\nLP. Maddy's vocals come over well again\njon the closing song, 'The Drunkard', an\nall-encompassing traditional folk tune.\nI hope by this time their folk fans won't have given up hope.\nNot a dazzling LP, and certainly not\nan appropriate follow-up to their last hit\nalbum. I think that Mike Batt has over worn his usefulness as producer, although on\nthe last LP he gave the band some needed\nnew breath. _ . . _\nClive Dewey\nFrantic funk adds moonshine\nlustre to debut effort\nMoon - Too Close For Comfort ( EPIC) Straight into it then, with Noel\nMcCall a's powerful vocals pumping out\n'You better look out stranger...' and the\nfirst Moon album begins to flood the\neardrums. The track in question is\n'Lone Ranger' and it stomps along like\nthe proverbial clappers, an up temp chunk\nof funk that bodes well for the rest of the\nplatter. For a relatively new band, who've\nbeen paying their dues in de pubs an' clubs, this is indeed a distinguished\nfirst spin on the turntable. They work up\na healthy sweat here and there on the\nA \u2014side and the combined versatility/ imagination McCall a's vocals always make for an interesting listen.\nThe quicker numbers are written by\ndrummer Luigi Salvoni (now departed) and\nDave Dennis, while the melodic moments,\nnamely 'Cold Nights' and 'Makin' Love',\nare normally supplied courtesy of lead\nguitarist Loz Netto. After these charming\nlittle interludes it's back to the rau nch with the title track, and probably the\nbest bit of butt-shaking on the album.\nIt builds up steam with a guitar/harmonica\nintro reminiscent of war at their best and\nchops it's way through five minutes of\nfrantic f run k, finally bowing out on a percussive flow.\nThe second side is a more low-key\naffair but quality is in no way sacrificed and it would seem a safe bet to presume\nthat Moon have collectively spent a lot of\ntime and thought making sure that their\nfirst release is an effort to be proud of.\nThe slower the pace, the more\nMcCall a gets into a song and smooths out\nthe lyrics. A singer with great talent,\nhe' s given plenty of room to experiment\non side two, there being no tracks with\nthe rush or immediacy of 'Lone Ranger'\nor' Too Close For Comfort'.\nThere are few albums released these\ndays, very few by a new band, of which\nit can be said there are no duff tracks\npresent, but this is one.

Generally, I was very impressed by the\norganisation of the stalls and the\nefficient way in which people cleared up\nafterwards and returned the hired tables \u2014\nthere were only a few exceptions.\nIt was inevitable that some societies( would turn up within the last 48 hours\nand request as tall, perhaps because\nthe previous year's committee had\nforgotten to do so. A few societies put\nup posters and signs with ' sell o tape', but most were more considerate.\nPublicity rules OK?\nOn the subject of publicity, the\npublicity rules are available from\nChalky; and the House Committee may\nhave one of their periodic purges on\n\" illegal\"( eg out of date) posters in the\nnear future (hint!).\nFreshers Fair was a very impressive\nsight. I could not estimate the number of\nstudents milling around. It was rather\nunfortunate that the afternoon was wet\nand windy, especially since this\nprevented the hot air balloon being\ninflated in the quadrangle. But I hope\nthat a good time was had by all. I can't get into my office\nAll is going well in the Union at\npresent, despite the fact that I am\nalmost unable to get into or out of my\noffice due to the students laying siege to\nPam and Jen for discount cards and room bookings respectively \u2014 not * to\nmention Union cards being authorised!\nORANGE\nMOLE\nby Derrick Everett\nIC Union DP\nMike dinner.\nThose of you who were at the Union\nmeeting last week (you were there,\nweren't you?) will remember, if (a) you were awake and (b) you knew what was going on,( which I did not most of the\ntime), that I mentioned two items concerning the Union's mascot in my report.\nThe mascot, 'Mike', is the totem or\nrallying point, if you like, for the body\nof students at IC. After discussions with a number of people, including some\nwho have had Mike in their personal\ncare in previous years, I suggested that\nMike be secured to a wall in the Union\nBar where the mascot can be seen by\nall IC students and their guests, but\nnot stolen by rival colleges. I hope that\nI shall receive suggestions from many\nmembers of the Union regarding this\nproject.\nSecondly, on November 3rd we are to\ncelebrate the 10th Birthday of our mascot,\nand to this purpose I am arranging a' small' dinner in the Union Dining Hall. This will involve lightening your wallets\nand purses by \u00a35.00, (don't cringe too\nmuch, some people have already paid!),\ncheques made payable to Imperial\nCollege Union. The dinner is slightly\nmore expensive than the Freshers\nDinners since the Union does not sub sid is e dinners \u2014 Freshers Dinners are sub sidi sed by the department.\nOne last world - please ensure that\nyou are carrying your Union cards in the\nUnion building, and that guests who do\nnot have cards under reciprocal agreements\nare signed into the guest book in the\nUnion bar (another hint!).\nAfter two weeks of IC you should all now be in a fit state for certification of\ninsanity. Personally, the clutch on my\nbrain is slipping; however, spare parts\nand my head shin ker permitting, back into\ntop gear and off with \u2014\nCrash Pad\nAfter having run for three weeks,\nthe Crash Pad is closing after tonight's' session'. There are, at the time of\nwriting, about half a dozen second and\nthird years still using the scheme. However, it has been decided to close the\nscheme since it appears that all first\nyear students now have somewhere to\nlive \u2014 the criterion being that second\nand third year students are, generally,\nbetter equipped to deal with finding\nsomeones floor to crash upon than a first year, who may not know a soul in\nCollege. I would like to say a special thankyou to John Mellors and Ross Darling who both gave up a great deal\nin order to man the scheme since its\ninception, also to Dave Knights who\nhelped out in the transition period from\nthe Temporary Rooms Scheme over into\nthe Crash Pad Scheme.\nElections.\nThe nomination papers for the\nfollowing posts are posted on the Council Notice Board in the Union Lower Lounge;\n(i) Student Residence Officer\n(ii) Welfare Officer\n(iii) Twomembers of the Permanent\nWorking Party of the Union\n(iv) Chairman of the Overseas Students\nCommittee\n(v) Honorary Junior Treasurer\nand also for ordinary membership of\nmany of the Union Committees eg Academic\nAffairs, External Affairs, Publications\nBoard, etc.\nAlso, papers for the election of 5 '\ndelegates and 3 observers to the Christmas 1\nNUS Conference are posted.\nIf you would like any information\nabout any of these posts then drop in\nand see me.\nWHITE\nLIES\nby John White\nIC Union Hon.Sec\nI have organised further meetings outside\nthe usual ICU stomping ground for later\nin the year; having removed one excuse\nwill you please now try and come \u2014\ngive it a chance! .\nOther business will include the\nelections mentioned earlier and hopefully\na debate as to whether ICU should\nre affiliate itself to the London Student\nOrganisation ( LSO) \u2014 bearing in mind\nthat this affiliation costs the Union\nabout \u00a3500 of your money.\nU GM The Union Meeting of the Thursday\nof the first week of term passed the\nChanges to the Constitution nem con\n(ie when put to the vote, without\ncontradiction or pos s it ion). On bringing\nthese changes to the next Union Meeting,\non approval of a two-thirds majority,\nthese changes will be in st it ued.A sI explained at the Union Meeting, the\nchanges I put forward were putting to\npaper what was generally accepted\nverbally, however, I would still urge\nyou to come to the next Union Meeting\nand consider the changes.\nThe next U GM \u2022* Thursday 28th October at 13.00 - will be in Mech Eng220, not in the Great Hall as usual. The venue for this meeting was chosen with\na certain m axum in mind, namely, 'if the\nMountain won't come to Mohamed, then\nMohamed must go to the Mountain'.\nParking\nThe Union Parking Committee has met\nand made its selection. If you were one\nof the lucky ones (about one third of-the\napplicants were not, unfortunately \u2014\nabout 330 students applied for 192\nplaces) then you may collect your\npermit from the Union Office from Monday\nonwards. Permits will be issued to\nsuccessful applicants on production of\nan authorised Union Card and a log\nbook corresponding to the vehicle and\nthe permit holder. For those unsuccessful\napplicants, only, you may fill in an appeals form which must be returned to\nthe Union Office by Friday 22nd October.\nTHE PARKING PERMIT SCHEME BEGINS ON MONDAY25 TH OCTOBER. After this date, the parking of cars not\ndisplaying Parking Permits will be\nprohibited.\nCom mem Ball\nAfter having had the afternoon of\nCommem Day off, why not go to the\nBall in the evening?

IC Union had initially\nbought a batch of 200 discount cards and associated handbooks.\nThe decision to sell the\ncards at less than the recommended \u00a32 was taken at last\nweek's Union General Meeting\nfollowing an IC Union\nExecutive recommendation.\nUnion officers argued that\nif the cards were sold at \u00a32\nthen the Union would receive\na50p commission on each card\nsold, an amount inconsistent\nwith the extra administrative\nwork required.\nThe warning came from\ndiscount scheme organiser\nPete An wy l who visited Imperial shortly after an\nexecutive meeting last Monday.\nHe told Honorary Secretary\nJohn White that if the Union\nanticipated selling the next\nbatch of cards at less than\nthe recommended \u00a32 then ICU could forget the additional\nsupplies.\nMore News\npage 3\nWHITEHALL UNDER SSRC MICROSCOPE The Social Science Research Council plans to make an anna ul grant of \u00a3100,000 for\nthe creation of a Policy Studies Centre early next year,\naccording to a report in the\nTimes Higher Education\nSupplement last Friday. The\nfunction of this centre will be\nfo analyse the making and\nimplementation of Government\npolicies. The Centre would probably\nbe based on an existing university department or\nresearch institute, and the\nLSE has been offered as a possible home by its director,\nProfessor Ralf Dahrendorf.\nThe Executive had formerly\nbeen advised by the Union Solicitor that the Union would\nbe on firm ground provided it\nwas Union policy to sell the\ncards at \u00a31.7 5, and provided\nthis offer was only open to\nIC students.\nSpeaking to FELIX Pete\nAn wy l refuted this argument\nstressing that an explicit condition of buying the cards\nfrom NUS was that they be\nsold at \u00a3 2 . He was particularly\nconcerned about the IC decision since he claims the\nUnion has been told many\ntimes in the last 3 months\nthat it must sell the card at\nits full price. Furthermore this\ncondition is explicitly made in\nthe briefing manual issued to\nUnions like ICU. Mr An wy l was also worried\nsince ICU are presently\nundercutting two NUS service\ncompanies End sleigh Insurance\nand NUS Travel, both of\nwhom are selling the card at\n\u00a32 and both of whom have\noffices within half a mile of\nIC. No decision has been\nmade about the cards by IC Union since Mr An wy l's visit. The matter is expected to be\ndiscussed at this Monday's Executive meeting and at the\nnext U GM on October 28th. So\nfar, in a week of trading ICU has sold just over 100 cards. According to Mr An wy l the\nscheme is otherwise fairing\nquite well and demand for the\ncard has so far exceeded\nexpectation. NUS has ordered\na reprint of the card and\nhandbook, 50,000 of each had\ninitially been printed.\nf% Paul Kurowski was this week\nelected unopposed as the new\nPresident of the Royal School\nof Mines Union. He takes the\nplace of Martin Levy who failed\nhis exams. Paul is in Mining 3\nand was last year's Mines Foreign Student Officer. He is also\na keen hockey player.\nr inside\nMORE NEWS - page 3\nTHAT was the week that\nwas - pages 10/11\nFOOD feature -page 6\nRADIO supplement -pages 7?S PARKING permits \u2022\nsuccessful applicants -page 19.\nfelix\n\n"

The course took in a number of.\nthe highest Surrey hills, including Leith Hill and\nRanmore Common, and to add to the toughness of the course, the day was one of the hottest\nof the summer.\nFirst to finish'from IC were\nthose stalwarts of IC Cross j Country Club, Pete Johnson\ni and Steve Webb, who achieved\nI third place in the \u2022remarkable\nI time of 5 hours 40 minutes.\nNot far behind, in12 th and\n13th places, were Alan Leakey and Rob All in son, whilst last\nyears Cross-Country Captain, Ian Ellis strolled round in7 hours 37 mi nut is.

NUS treasurer, Chris Morgan\nlater replied that this was rubbish, and implied that Mr\nBrown was merely starting his organisation in a fit of pique,\nhaving himself failed three\ntimes to be elected as NUS treasurer. The finances of the\nnew ' Union' are however\nclouded in mystery. All Mr\nBrown will say is that he is\nbacked by 'private firms in the\nCity'. Admitting that, at first\nsight the BSA appeared to be\noffering cheaper travel and\nlower subscriptions, Mr Morgan\nsaid T have no doubt at all that it will be another of the\nfly-by-night operations which\nend up taking students money\nand being unable to deliver the\ngoods'.\nTHOUGHTS FOR\nA BUM LECTURE\n'I'm never happy unless I'm unhappy.' - Dave Dodge RC SU'I was once done with a teddy\nbear like that.J Dave Fox all.'

Yes, I was on\nholiday until the 13 September\nand yes, this does give PART of the explanation, but it\nimplies that the Registry\ngoes to sleep when I am not\nthere and nothing could be\nfurther from the truth. Indeed\nI sometimes think that the\nwork of the Registry goes on\nin spite of me and not because\nof me. There were many\nreasons why the Fresher s' mailing was not attended to\nin my absence. Not the\nleast of which was the\nconsiderable amount of work\nthat was being handled in the office during this period.\nTo my colle gue s and to\nthe best staff of any office\nin Imperial may I offer my\napologies if they thought\nthat the reason given in FELIX implied that \" while the cat's away, the mice\nwill play\". p Yours faithfully,\nJE HL each Executive Officer\nRegistry\nColour\nCovers\nDear Sir, \u2014 Congratulations on\na fine issue \u2014 I sincerely hope\nthat the full-colour spread has the desired effect on prospective\nadvertisers.\nHowever, I should like to\ndraw your attention to the section in your Editorial which\nclaims that the Fresher s Day issue is\"... the first litho e dUG issue to use a colour\ncover.\" Colour covers for\nFELIX were used extensively in the session1974/75.

    "content": "8 - FELIX, OCTOBER15 th1976 Capital Radio\nAnd with it came the demise of\nCapital punishment\n1\n9\n4\nm MW CAPITAL RADIO 95.8 KHz UHF\nCapital Radio is London' s twenty-four\nhour Commercial radio station. Celebrating\nits third birthday at 5am on Sunday,\nCapital has, in this short time, grown\ninto a force surpassed by no other\ncommercial radio station in Britain. With a programme basis of good music, competitions and phone-ins it might\nseem to be just like the rest but the\nquality of its presenters lift it to\ngreater heights. No second-division\nstation could employ \u2014 and keep the\nservices of the likes of Gerald Harper,\nMichael As pel, Dave Cash, or the loon\nhimself, \" Cuddly\" Kenny Everett.\nBut these household names are only\npart of the hard-working family of\npresenters that make up CapitaL The person who has the greatest\nnumber of hours a week is Roger Scott,\npresenter of the ' Daily Slot' from three\nin the afternoon through to seven in the\nevening. He also hosts the Capital Countdown, Capital's own singles\nchart, on Saturday mornings from nine till noon.\nHis twenty-three hours a week\ncinema may seem excessive but there\nhave been no complaints from listeners\nor from Roger. Certainly the variety\ntherein is enough to keep the most\ndiscerning listener happy. Despite his mammoth schedule, mammoth indeed by\nBritish radio standards that is, Roger\nis still able to spare some time to\ntalk to FELIX about Capital. Essentially Roger's own weekday\nprogramme has to cater for most music\ntastes because of its time span, and the\nconsequential mixture of listeners.\nAbout a year ago Capital decided to\nrearrange early evening programmes and\nbefore this change Roger finished at\n6pm. 'The basic change was just to\nextend my programme from six to seven\no 'clock. They used to have the news\npackage at six o 'clock, but came to\nrealise that it was too early, and that\nLBC - Where news comes first\nContinued from page 7\nfour months of this year, without mentioning an alternative figure). They have\nreceived support from Canadian radio\ninterests and are allowed considerable\nflexibility by the IBA who are loath to\nsee the station fail due to its news\nservice forthe other stations. Unfortunately\n'their programmes now show definite\nsigns of tight finances. This vicious circle could well be unbreakable.\nLBC aloof, but needs support\nWhilst 1 have visited the station in the\npast, LBC did not seem to consider\nF EL DC important enough to allow a visit and an interview, which could have\nallowed them to put their present position\nforward. Maybe F EL DC is not the Daily Mirror (thank goodness! - Ed) but LBC would seem to reel all the support that\nthey can get at present.\nthere were too many people driving\nhome at that time of evening who would\nrather hear music for another hour. So,\nbasically, my bit of the shift was\nstretched out a bit'.\nSo Roger inherited an extra five\nhours per week. However his timeslot is more like a number of different shows\nrather than one four-hour bundle.\nChanging Emphasis\n'It changes as you feel the audience\nchange. At three o 'clock it's oldies\nthe Three O 'clock Thrill \u2014 because the\nkids are at school for a start; then at\nfour, four thirty you get into things that\nare gonna interest them (the kids) like\nthe Top Ten and the People's Choice.'\n(A chance for the listener to vote for\none of two brand new records that Roger\nhas chosen, from Monday to Thursday,\nwith the four winners battling it out in the People's Choice final on Friday. The winning single is the one that\ngets the most phone-in votes, and it\nbecomes the People's Choice; ie Record\nof the Week \u2014 for the forthcoming week.)\n'So it is just changing it (the program-me) and adjusting it as your audience is\nchanging. Then at six o 'clock, six to\nseven it gets a bit loose and you can\nhave a little more freedom because the\nmums and dads all sit goggling in front\nof the box anyway.So you can practically\nwrite them off; the people left listening\nat the time are a little bit more involved-in the music so you can lend to take a few more liberties with the play list.'\nPlaylist\nThe play list is the magic word around\nradio stations. It is the list of records,\npredominantly singles, that make up the\nstation's standard music composition for\nthe week. All records on the playlist\nshould, in theory, have an equal number\nof plays per week.\nA record outside the playlist is unlikely to receive much air time, if any, on the 'pop' music programmes. Capital's playlist is decided at weekly meetings\nwhich are chaired by the music director,\nAidan Day, and which enable most of the\npresenters to have their say in the\nmatter. With the playlist in operation\nRoger Scott, for instance, would walk\ninto the studio and, depending on the\nfeel of the programme, would pick out a record near the front of the various\nsections \u2014 the ones at the back being\nrecords just played \u2014 so that there is no\nset disc order or set times that a certain\nrecord should be played. In fact he has virtually complete\nfreedom of choice within the playlist, but 'even though there might be 'a specific record on the playlist that you\nhate you don't avoid that record because\nyou know that ther's gonna be hundreds\nand thousands of people out there who\nare gonna love it when you put it on.'\nIn point of fact Roger has10 to 15 per\ncent of the programme material left\nentirely up to him. On the subject of Capital's future\nRoger had this to say: 'Capital wants to\nconsolidate and always change. I think\nyou must always keep changing. If you\nstay the same then you get stale and\ndon't progress at all.It's a very dangerous\nsituation that we are in really; being as\nsuccessful as we have become in the\nthree years it is very easy to get complacent about it \u2014 sort of sit back and\nsay \" well aren't we good?\" and \" have n't we done well?\". If you do that then it's the beginning of the end, se we don't do\nthat, we don't realty think about that. We\nare always thinking about how we can\nchange it, how we can improve it and\nthings we can do, like the Helpline\nthing that we started. Things like that\nwhich aren't gimmicks and they aren't things that are going to gain us an\nenormous audience. They are not flashy\nthings to do, but things like that they\nhelp us get more involved and more\ninto the community. It's things like that,\nnow that we apparently have this large\naudience, that enable us to consolidate\nthe audience figures, so that they (the\nlisteners) are there just because they're\ngoing to hear records they want to\nhear but because there are other things\ngoing on as well.'\nThe weekly review of Capital's situation ensures that it provides a service that you, the listener, require.\nSo much so, that Capital could still be\naround in2167 \u2014 think about it.\nRadio London\nThe true\nlocal'\nstation\n\" Radio London is London' s only local radio station\" \u2014 the confident words of\nAlan Holden its station manager. 1\nrecently went along to Radio London to\nsee how they put together nearly eighteen\nhours cf programmes a day. Radio London is a comparatively new\nBBC local station which opened, on VHF in 1970. With the decision to put local radio onto medium wave in 1972, Radio\nLondon also went out on 206 metres, a difficult wavelength to get a good\ncoverage but one which does at least\nallow Radio London to reach a far wider\naudience than on VHF. It is BBC policy\nthat all their local stations are completely\nindependant from the BBC edition ally. Continued on page 13\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX, OCTOBER15 th19767 Sounds about town\nBroadcast radio has now been in\nLondon for 54 years, starting humbly\nwith 2LO broadcasting from the roof\nof Selfridges by the British Broadcasting Company. The BBC rapidly opened\nother stations throughout the country\nand was made a public corporation.\nin 1927 (perhaps they'll be celebrating\nanother 50than iv ersary next year?).\nDuring the 30's the BBC changed\nit's structure to the 'National' and\nan alternative network of regional\nstations. After the war the 'National'\nbecame the 'Light Programme' and\nthe regional s the 'Home Service'.\nThese were joined by the 'Third\nProgramme' in the late 40's. Domestic\nbroadcasting until this time had been\non the long and medium wave but the\n50's saw the introduction of the\nli rst VHF transmitters.\nOutside law, not illegal\nDuring the 50's and early 60's it\nwas generally assumed that television\nwould virtually replace radio in the\nfuture. This theory was proved not\nnecessarily correct by the pirates in\nthe mid 60's. The first of the pirates\nwas Radio Caroline, broadcasting\nfrom a boat anchored off the Essex\ncoast. The pirates exploited the\nadvantages of radio over TV. Like\nits low cost, its person el appeal and\nits ability to form images in the mind\nof the lie ie ner. These stations were\nin international waters so they were\noutside the law (rather than illegal).\nThe government attempted, fairly\nsuccessfully, to control these stations\nin 1967 by making any link that they\nhad with the UK illegal (although\nthey do not have any control over the\nbroadcasting itself). This saw the\ndeath of most of the pirates.\nThe pirates had clearly demonstrated that radio was still very much\nalive, so the BBC pushed ahead on\ntwo fronts; it split the Light Programme\nJOHN ALLEN and NIGEL DAVIES take a look at national,\ncommercial and local radio.\ninto the present Radio 1 and 2 and it\nre-introduced local stations.\nIn October 1973 the first of .the\nreconstituted IBA's commercial\nstations, LBC, opened; this has been\nfollowed by 18 other stations.\nThe two London local commercial\nstations, LBC and Capital Radio do\ncommand a fair audience but do not\nseem to be paying well. Both have\nhad to be helped in the recent past\nby Canadian interests (now 29% of\nCapital Radio and 49.5% of LBC)\npossible reasons for this are LBC's original costing for it supplying news\nfor the projected 60 stations whilst\nonly 19 are on the air and Capital's enormous staff (over 200) including\npeople on big star salaries.\nFriendly Radio London\nOf the London stations the one to\nwatch in the future is the BBC local\nstation, Radio London, the audience\nfigures are rising rapidly - a fact\nthat will not surprise anyone who has\nmet its manager, Alan Holden, who is\na major driving force. Anyone who has\nbeen to several of the stations, as I have, cannot have failed to notice\nthe very friendly atmosphere of the\nstation compared with some of the.\nothers.\nFuture depends on Annan report\nThe future of broadcasting is\ncurrently held in the balance awaiting\nthe publication of the Annan\nCommittee report on its future. The\noutcome of this is hard to predict but\nthey have already stated that they\nare in favour of local radio so it\nwould seem that it is here to stay in\nsome form. There is some speculation\nthat local radio will be taken from\nboth the BBC and IBA and be controlled\nby the same body-.\nLBC Where news comes first\nThe first commercial radio station in Britain was LBC( the London Broadcasting Company) which opened in October 1973 a week before its sister\nstation Capital Radio^ The format is very\ndifferent from that of all the other\ncommercial stations as it is intended\nto be a news and information station with\nthe image 'LBC \u2014 where news comes\nfirst'.\nLondon news squeezed out\nInitially their programmes were a vaguely news \u2014 based \u2014 magazine\nformat; these have now been sharpened\nup during the daytime, but unfortunately\n(due to limited finances) the London news\nhas been squeezed.out and there are a considerable number of information\nspots, which only allow a few minutes\nof news interviews before the next one\nbegins.\nThe heart of the station is the\nnew room, it is here that the news\nbulletins are compiled from correspondents\nall over the world. Other stations either\nrelay these bulletins live (under the\nname of Independant Radio News \u2014 IRN) or use the reports to add to local news\nwhich they assemble into their own locally produced bulletins. This allows all of the stations to compete satisfactorily\nwith the BBC news service.
