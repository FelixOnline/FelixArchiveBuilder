It is a really excellent piece\nof journalism and I recommend it to\nyou.\nSupping in Style\nWhatever part you take in Union\nActivities, it is almost certain that the\norganisation involved will have its annual dinner this term. So perhaps a couple of sentences on when to bang the\ntable and what to do with the Port may\nbe useful to some of my multitudinous\nband of readers.\n1. Sherry will be served at a reception\nfrom approximately 7.00 p.m. until\n7.30 p.m., when somebody will bang\na gong or stand on a table and say\nwords to the effect of \" My Lords,\nLadies and Gentlemen, Dinner is\nserved\", or, alternatively. ''Oil;\nNosh'sup!\"2. The assembled multitudes then go\ninto the dining room, and stand at\ntheir places until the Chairman has\nsaid a form of grace, and then sit\ndown.\n3. The meal is then served. One does\nNOT( a) smoke, or\n(b) leave the room\nuntil after the toast to the Queen.\nIt is customary at Imperial College\nto bang the table if somebody leaves the\nroom before the Loyal Toast. At Club Dinners he will often be required to\ndrink a pint of beer before sitting down\nto continue his meal.\n4. The Port is passed from right to left,\neach diner pouring his own glass;\nthe decanter is not put down until\neach person's glass is full.\n5. When the Loyal Toast is proposed,\nthe company stands and says \" The Queen\". Toasts are taken seated only\non board ship.\n6. It is in order to smoke or leave the\nroom after the Loyal Toast.\n7. There will probably be some other\nspeeches and toasts. It is in order\nto laugh at the jokes but this rarely\nhappens (to my jokes, anyway).\n8. After the speeches, diners do not\nleave the table until the Chairman\nand his party leave. He will often\nsuggest the dinner adjourns to a neighbouring bar.\nIf anybody doubts my qualifications\nto impart this knowledge, I went to 23\ndinners last term (and paid for most of\nthem), enjoyed the omelettes or stuffed\npeppers and actually turned down one\ninvitation. I shall be glad to expound\nfurther if anybody is confused\u2014especially as to the origins of some of the\nrituals\u2014if you come and see me.\nMartin C. Black MINUTES OF AN EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING OF THE IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION, HELD ON TUESDAY,12 th DECEMBER1972 IN THE GREAT HALL OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE1. The Honorary Secretary, Mr. M.C. Black, was in the Chair; there were approximately350 members present. The meeting was opened at 1.18 p.m.2. Mr. Jo witt explained that the motion of Ratification of Election Procedure passed by the U. G.M. of30 th November1972 had been referred back to the Union by Council for, and with, clarification, recommending that the E.G. M. pass the motion\" The Union ratifies this election and its results for President of the Imperial College Union for the Session1972/73\", again. Mr. Coffey spoke against and M r.A.E. Smith spoke for the motion. Mr. Gillett proposed a move to a vote. This was carried. Mr. Jo witt summed up. The Motion was passed overwhelmingly with20 members voting against and16 abstentions. The Chairman passed the Chair to Mr. John Lane, President of the Union.3. Returning Officer's Report i The Honorary Secretary, as Returning Officer for the Election of a Representative for the Department of Geology, declared Mr. Easter brook elected unopposed.4. Report of the Delegation to theN. U.S. Conference at Margate Mr. Armitage spoke at length on behalf of the delegation, and introduced the report which had been circulated( filed\nin the Minute Book). Mr. Castle dine spoke on the Grants debate. The delegation answered questions from the floor\nand Mr. Corby n spoke on Rent Strikes. Mr. Armitage suggested one of the best\nways of reporting back to the Union was to debate motions passed by N.U.S. at\nU.G. Ms, and he asked the Union to note the Motion on Thalidomide which had been circulated( filed in Minute Book). He then proposed\" Imperial College Union boycott the products of the Distillers Company Limited\" inline with instruction A3 of theN. U.S. Motion. He asked members to sign the petitions which were being circulated. Mr. Dow son pointed out that although Mr. Armitage was asking the Union to boycott spirits, D. C.L. had a large in te rest in two breweries and he felt that this should be included in the motion. This amendment was accepted. Mr. Newman proposed an amendment making the boycott voluntary. This was defeated. Mr. Phillips proposed an amendment asking the College not to useD. C.L. products. This was accepted. The Motion as amended was passed overwhelmingly. Miss Hoch f elder began to propose a motion on Grants. Mr. Hoskins proposed a move to next business. This was passed.5. Indochina Mr. Corby n proposed:\" I.C.U. recognises the importance of the struggle of the Indochinese people as\npart of the struggle all over the world against Imperialism. I.C.U. realises that the U.S. Army will only in fact withdraw if they are driven out by the strength of the revolutionary movement in Indochina and the worldwide solidarity movement. I.C.U. notes the call by the Vietnamese National Liberation Front for the rebuilding of the worldwide solidarity movement, and welcomes the in i at ive taken in Britain to organise the Indochina Solidarity Conference. Hence, further to requests:1. ICU affiliates to the Indochina Solid sarit y Conference and agrees to elect delegates from this meeting to report back on how ICU can help build the solidarity movement. This movement to be organised in I.e. by the Indochina Solidarity Front.2. ICU agrees to pay \u00a320 affiliation fee/\ndonation.3. ICU agrees to pay \u00a320 towards the cost of posters for the coming campaign, these posters to be printed by Brian ts Colour Printers.\" After discussion the motion was taken in parts and the first part was defeated. The Hon. Secretary explained that since the first part had been defeated it was pointless to continue discussion since it would be concerned with paying money to an organization the Union had just decided not to support.( i Brian ts Colour Printers Mr. A. Smith proposed:\" ICU recognises that the people' working in' at Brian ts Colour Printers are fight-ing, with the only method available to\nthem, to defend their jobs. Also that during this fight they have shown how such struggles can best be fought by using the works as a focus for other working class struggles such as during the fight to free the five London docker s when Brian ts printed posters in support of the five.\nHence, I.C.U.:1. Will offer all future printing orders to Brian ts in the first instance, since it is only with orders that the work in can continue.2. Resolves to donate from Union funds the sum of \u00a350 to defend this work in.3. Strongly urges all organisations it supports or affiliates to to get printing done at Brian ts.\" Mr. Wadsworth pointed out that Entertainments Committee had taken es tima tes from Brian ts Colour Printers and that these were of the same order as their present printers. After brief discussion the motion was taken in parts.' the first and third parts were carried, the second \u2014 to donate \u00a350\u2014was defeated.7, University of South Kensington Mr. Armitage proposed:\" ICU reaffirms its support in U.S.K. as a sociopolitical entity, and hopes to see\nclubs and societies not only offering membership to U.S.K. students, but also being run on a U.S.K. basis, that is t \u00bb 1\nsay, by officers drawn from U.S.K. colleges. ICU pledges to consider financial support, in conjunction with other U.S.K. Colleges, to any society or group which wishes to become a U.S.K. society or group.\" Mr. Hos kings proposed an amendment that the motion should not apply to Rag. Mr. Armitage accepted this amendment. The Motion was passed.8. The Quorum was successfully challenged. The President closed the meeting at 2.22\np.m. "

However your floating there is not helping us get the Twig worm back in the bosom of his family \u2014 so to speak. We must rescue you immediately. How do you turn that thing off?\"\" Don't touch it,\" yelled Phosphorous,\" I'm ten feet up in the air; I 'll break something if you turn it off suddenly\"\" Good thinking, dear lad,\" said Ferocious,\" but not an insurmountable problem, methinks. The Twig worm is easily tall enough to catch you as I turn it off.\" The Twig worm blanched.\" I couldn't possibly do that,\" he said,\" I mean the res pon sibi lit y,I just couldn't face it.\"\" Give me strength,\" muttered Ferocious under his breath.\" Dear old enormous person,\" he said out loud,\" the continuation of this adventure depends on your using your much abused height at this juncture.\" The Twig worm wrung his hands and bit his huge rubbery lip.\" Well, I 'll try,\" he said,\" but don't expect too much.\"\" Goodman,\" said Ferocious, enjoying his new role as man of action,\" to your places men.\" The Twig worm shuffled up to Phosphorous and got ready to catch him. Ferocious disappeared round the back of the Device. There was a pregnant moment of silence. Nothing happened. Ferocious reemerged.\" Actually,\" he said,\" It's more complicated than I thought. There doesn't seem to be a lever marked OFF' or anything. I could just rip out a handful of wires \u2014 as it were \u2014 but I might get slightly electrocuted in the process. Has anybody got any ideas?\" There was a pause.\" The Gum boots!\" shouted Phosphorous suddenly.\" Of course,\" said Ferocious,\" Phosphorous, dear boy, I sometimes think that deep in that tiny brain of yours there\nburns as park of genius.\"\" Thankyou.\" said Phosphorous.\" Where are the strange things?\" asked Ferocious.\" In my pocket,\" replied Phosphorous. Sure enough, from Phosphorous' pockets protruded the toes of the Partially Invisible Gum boots.\" This is all very well,\" said Phosphorous,\" but what are we going to do with them?\"\" Good point,\" acknowledged Ferocious,\" As I see it the situation is this; we don't knowhow to turn off the Device without injuring me. Or you,\" he added, seeing the look of Phosphorous' face.\" Now who does knowhow to turn\nit off?\"\" Hag g is Mac Plumbing does,\" said Phosphorous.\" Is that a name or a meal?\" asked Ferocious facetiously.\" He' s the engineer \u2014 and he got me up here in the first\nplace.\"\"' He is patently the man for the job,\" said Ferocious,\" where is he and will he doi t?\"\"He went outside, and he wasn't very keen to let me go before,\" said Phosphorous.\" A sticky one, dear boy,\" mused Ferocious,\" I feel we must use low cunning. Function, much taxed, grey cells, a solution is required.\" Ferocious s at down, head in hands, and pondered. The sounds of the fair filtered through the walls of the tent, and a breeze flapped the canvas.\" Do hurry. Ferocious,\" whispered Phosphorous,\" Old Hag g is may comeback at any minute, and then I 'll be stuck here for life.\"\" Have patience, dear lad,\" said Ferocious,\" even jolly oldE in s te!l didn't get a touch of the instantaneous Eureka s. Something is beginning to formulate if you' ll just shut up for a moment.\" Phosphorous whistled tunelessly to himself, and the Twig worm tried unsuccessfully to twiddle his thumbs.\" I have it!\" shouted Ferocious, at last, \" You put on the Gum boots, Phosphorous, and then, of course, you' ll disappear.\"\" Yeah, but the boots won't\" objected Phosphorous,\" and I 'll still be up here.\"\" Have patience, once again,\" pleaded Ferocious,\" and listen to the rest of my brilliant scheme. It will then look\nas if a pair of Gum boots is floating there and nothing else. I will then leave the tent, and complain to the management that there is only a pair of old boots floating, and not the Creature from beyond Mars, as promised. They will send somebody into see. He will see the boots, turn off the machine, the Twig worm catches Phosphorous as he falls, and wer unlike nothing on earth. How does that appeal to you, fellow adventurers?\" Phosphorous looked at the Twig worm.\" As long as he can catch meal right,\" he said,\" it\" As long as he can catch meal right,\" he said,\" it sounds tremendous. You are clever, Ferocious.\" Did he detect a note of sarcasm, wondered Ferocious.\" Thankyou, dear boy,\" he said,\" It was absolutely nothing. If we are agreed then I suggest that we proceed. Pop the boots on. Phosphorous, and off we go.\" Phosphorous wriggled the Partially Invisible Gum boots out of his pockets, and with much grunting managed to pull them on; no easy task, floating ten feet up in the air. As soon as he had both boots securely on his fee the disappeared. All that remained was a pair of rather scruffy gum boots, kicking slightly, with no visible means of support.\" Remarkable,\" said Ferocious,\" Most cc n vinci ng. I will now find a representative of the management, as planned. Try to look outraged, Twig worm.\" With these words he turned and left the tent. Outside stood the oldman who had taken their lOpon the way in.\" Excuse me,\" said Ferocious,\" but I must protest in the strongest possible terms. Having laid out the not inconsiderable sum of 5 p,in order to observe the Creature from beyond Mars,I did not expect to be confronted with a pair of\nsecondhand Wellington s \u2014 obviously suspended from the ceiling with string. I demand to see the manager immediately.\" Hag g is, for it was none other, paled visibly.\" Secondhand Wellington s, ye say,\" he grated\" Is there\nno a scruffy wee laddie, wi' a nose like a potato, floating in there?\"\" There most certainly is not,\" said Ferocious firmly,\" I will lodge a complaint with the authorities.\"\" Och d inna be in such a hurry, s orr,\" said Mac Plum bih g,\"I'm sure there' s been some mistake \u2014 you comeback in there wi' me now and we'll see what' sup.\"\" Oh, very well,\" said Ferocious,\" but Is hall expect my money back at the very least.\" Old Hag g is turned, and Ferocious allowed himself to be led back into the tent. There floated the Gum boots, as before, with the Twig worm trying to look outraged, and ready to catch Phosphorous, at the sametime.\" Burn me sporran!\" cried the oldman.\" How did the wee laddie ever get down out o' the field?\" he turned to Ferocious.\" Ido apologise, s orr, there seems to have been some kind of technical hitch. You can have your money back, of\ncourse, and your large friend as well.\"\" Oh, thankyou,\" said the Twig worm,\" that really is awfully nice of you, it's not often you get this sort of\nservice nowadays, is it?\"\" Don't overdo it,\" whispered Ferocious. Hag g is had gene round the back of the Device.\" I'll just turn off the field,\" he said,\" and get them boot souto' the way.\"\" Get ready, Twig worm,\" said Ferocious. The Twig worm shuffled over towards the Gum boots, and raised his great arms in readiness. The note of the machine began to fall, and so did the boots. The Twig worm lunged gracelessly forward and grabbed them. There was a shout and a crash, as Phosphorous reappeared on the floor in a heap. The Twig worm was proudly waving the boots and shout in g\"I've got him, I 've got him.\"\" Are you alright,\" asked Ferocious of his fallen friend.\" I think so,\" said Phosphorous checking his extremities.\" Come on then,\" shouted Ferocious,\" Let's get out of\nhere.\"\" What on earth's going on?\" demanded Hag g is, coming out from behind the Device. But he was too late. Ferocious and Phosphorous were dragging the still triumphant Twig worm out through the door of the tent.\" Comeback!\" shouted the old engineer, waving his arms hysterically,\" You' ll no get way with this, you mark my words.\" Seeing the trio running away into the maze of tents and sideshows. Hag g is Mac Plumbing rushed to where a lever stood, by the trapdoor in the floor. Over the lever hung a notice:\" GENERAL ALARM\" it read,\" penalty for improper use \u00a3 5 . \" Old Mac Plumbing grasped the lever and pulled hard. Deep within the passageways beneath, an ethereal wail began, echoing around the tunnels, and arousing the Luigi Rabbit Organisation. The pounding of feet could be heard over the wail of the alarm. The chase was on. Meanwhile Ferocious and Phosphorous were leading the Twig worm as fast as they could away from the Device tent,\nfi id deep into the fair. They had put several tents between them and the Device, when Ferocious called a halt.\" We must be O.K. here,\" he said,\" They' ll never find\nus in this maze.\"\" Oh, I don't know,\" said Phosphorous, \"If that nasty Luigi Rabbit is after us, you don't know what might happen.\" Hardly had he spoken than a voice squeaked out, somewhere above their heads;\" Hello sweeties, this is your old chum Luigi Rabbi there. Now you' ve been awfully naughty, running away from poor old Hag g is like that. You comeback this very minute, de aries, and we'll say no more about it. Don't think for a moment that you can escape me. My dear boys are everywhere. I'm sure you can hear me,I have these super loudspeakers all over the fair.\" The three escapees looked at each other.\" Well,\" said Ferocious,\" things seem a little more complicated than I had at first assumed.\"\" You can say that again,\" said Phosphorous.\" He may well be bluffing about the\" dear boys everywhere,\" went on Ferocious,\" So I propose that we take it\nas quietly as we can away from the fair. If we're spotted, the jolly old Twig worm here can getup to maximum speed \u2014\nso to speak \u2014 and Phosphorous and I will scamper along in his wake. I doubt if even Luigi Rabbit can stop a stampeding Twig worm.\" The Twig worm was not convinced.\" This is all very worrying,\" he complained,\" I mean Is han' t know what to do.\"\" Dear old fleshy mound,\" said Ferocious,\" All you have to do is run when Ish out'run'. It will all workout I'm sure.\"\" If you say so,\" said the Twig worm. Stealthily the adventurers tiptoed away towards the edge of the fair. The perimeter was insight when two figures emerged from the shadows.\" Hold it right there, you guys,\" grunted Dino Confetti.\"\" Yeah, man\" said Whiskers.\" RUN!\" bellowed Ferocious. Like avast rubber pistone ds team engine, the Twig worm began to move forward. Cubic yards of air rushed into his Zeppelin sized lungs. The ground trembled as his gargantuan feet crashed down. Like a berserk bulldozer he was away, thrusting tents, trees, and Dino Confetti aside in a tidal wave of flowing momentum. A hastily flung carrot was the only sign of pursuit. On thundered the Tiny Twig worm, his arms pumping, legs squashing like springs at every step, his plate sized eyes streaming in his self generated whirlwind. As her an great shrieks of laughter burst from his mouth. What mortal creature could stand before a Twig worm in full flight? Always his size had been an embarrassment in the company of smaller creatures. Now he was a colossus in motion, a juggernaut released, his vastness a badge of honour. His heart sang, as his limbs crashed and churned.\" STOP.\" a reedy voice from somewhere behind him penetrated his reverie. It was Ferocious, panting hard, and vainly trying to halt the rushing giant. Slowly the Twig worm slowed to walk, and finally stopped. He s at down, only slightly out of breath. He beamed around at Ferocious, and a gasping Phosphorous whose little legs had left him some way behind.\" Did Ido alright?\" asked the Twig worm. Ferocious was getting his breath back.\" Magnificent dear boy,\" he breathed,\" In ever expected anything like it. I only hope the bill for the damage never finds its way back to me.\"I am glad you' re pleased,\" said the Twig worm,\" I must admit I enjoyed that little run immensely. There' s not much room for a good run in a Twig wor mery, and it was rather frowned en at the Centre.\" Ferocious smiled.\" I'll bet it was,\" he said,\" one afternoon's trot and there\nwouldn't have been much Centre left.\" Phosphorous was also recovering, and added his congratulations.\" But it was all Ferocious' idea,\" said the Twig worm. modestly.\" Thankyou,\" replied Ferocious,\" but we mustn' tsi there congratulating each other indefinitely. That villainous rabb it will be after us even more, now we'ver una Twig worm through his tents. We must press on \u2014 after all we are supposed to begetting the Twig worm back to his folks, are we not?\" The others agreed, and so they all got to their feet, and plodded off down the beach once more. They had crossed the dunes, and were walking by these a's edge, when they noticed a huge dark object, crouched on the s and. As they approached, they could hear it grumbling away to itself:\" It's not as if I ask for very much,\" it went\" just a drop of the high octane stuff now and again, and the occasional service. And what doI get? dumped on this lousy beach, that' s what I get, with no decent landing facilities, and soggy s and in me undercarriage. I don't know what aviation is\ncoming to.\"\" What is it?\" whispered Phosphorous.\" I've no idea, dear boy,\" said Ferocious,\" Let us approach it and inquire.\" Drawing near to the contraption, they could see that it was an aeroplane. It was very large indeed, a biplane with miles of wires and two huge engines slung under the wings.\" It's Alcock and Brown, took the wrong tu.l i ing,\" giggled Ferocious.\" Who?\" asked Phosphorous.\" Nevermind,\" said Ferocious,\" I will ask it what it is\ndoing on this beach. It is no doubt something to do with this adventure \u2014 everything else round here seems to be.\" He walked up to the plane.\" Ahem,\" he said,\" Iam Ferocious D in and this is Phosphorous the Job rot. The t ali gentleman is the Tiny Twig worm, on whose adventure we are engaged. Are you by any coincidence in anyway connected with the aforesaid adventure?\"\" AmI connected with the aforesaid adventure, he asks,'* grumbled the' plane,\" I have only been sitting here on this damp beach for several days, waiting for you to show up, you verbose little man.\"\"I say that' sab it strong,\" said Ferocious,\" we have gone through considerable hardship to get here and when we do, all you do is insult us. My opinion of the Adventurers Association has gone down a lot I must say.\"\" Is i there for weeks,\" said the plane, unaffected by Ferocious' outburst,\" and a bunch of idiots like you lot show up. It was never like this in the old Imperial Airways days. Ah, the style, the luxury, the subtly expressed elegance, those were the days. Not like now \u2014 ferrying offensive adventurers about. There was excitement then \u2014 now it's just one milk run after another.\" He paused for breath.\" If it's excitement you crave,\" said Ferocious,\" then those people down tl we are about to supply some.\" They followed the direction of his pointing finger. Scurr ying along the beach towards them came a large crowd. At its head rana little furry figure, with long silk years, and a cigarette holder. Behind him strode a tall manina bulging tre no he oat, and a this side bounced a tiny bristly person, waving a carrot. Yes! It was Luigi the Rabbit Organisation in full strength.\" Oh dear,\" said Phosphorous. "

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX January 8, 1973\nScience in\nSociety Readers' Letters\nWhy should scientists and engineers, rather than ordinary working people\nor people in professions have a special responsibility to society? Because of\nthe special skills and powers which they acquire during their training. The learning of scientific method, a very powerful philosophical tool, enables\nthem to understand some of the natural world, and hence to control it. The knowledge thus gained may make them experts in their field, and their\njudgements will be relied upon by these people, possibly in positions of\npower, who do not have the knowledge. The crux of social responsibility is\nfor each scientist to dec' de HOW he is to apply his knowledge, whether it is\nto be for the benefit of mankind as a whole, or for, say, a company or a defence ministry.\nIn one area of science,\nthe ethical and moral\nproblems come under\nclose scrutiny. Medical doctors use scientific\nmethod in their work,\nwhich because it involves people directly, has a professional body to oversee it, and a code of\nconduct to which all doctors adhere. Could this\nsystem be extended to\ninclude all scientists and technologists? It would be more difficult since\nmedicine is a rather well\ndefined field: but at least\nscientists involved in\nmedical and pharmaceutical research could profitably be tied to a code of conduct, the nature of which could be\nkept under constant review by a representative\ngroup of scientists. In\nthis way it would be recognised that the ethical\nproblems raised by, say,\ntest-tube babies, were\nbeing considered by the\nscientific community as\na whole, and not by each\nindividual research wor-ker.\nAlready, workers who use vivisection in their\nresearch are required to\nhold a Home Office licence which embodies a code of conduct. Should workers who undertake\nundesirable research be\n'struck off? This is a very difficult question,\nsince it seeks to draw\nthe line between what is\nneutral with regard to\nknowledge and what is\nnot.\nIt can fairly be said\nthat knowledge is neu-tr al, but that its application will inherently contain the biases and prejudices of its user. It is\nfalse to assume that the\nknowledge gatherer (the\nscientist) is totally neutral in this respect and that the knowledge ap-p lier( the engineer or\ntechnologist) is totally\nbiased. The only neutral\nknowledge is the reading\non a meter, and even this\nis dependent on the design of the experiment\nand apparatus. When this reading is written\ndown it has again gone\nvia a biased human being and must be viewed\nas such. Also, experimental results must be\ninterpreted by the experimenter in the light\nof a theoretical model, and the controversies in\nsome aspects of science\nclearly indicate that interpretations can differ.\nHence the scientist, al though he may like to\nbelieve that all the research he does is in pursuit of pure knowledge,\nhas a definite responsibility to society because\nhe defines his own opinions and prejudices with\nhis results and conclusions. An area of special\nconcern here is experimental psy c ology with\nrespect to intelligence\nand race, or environmental effects on I.Q. A similar responsibility lies in the scientist\nlooking for the scientific\nand social effects of his\nresearch. He cannot divorce the social effects\nfrom scientific curiosity,\nsaying that they are not\nhis concern, because\nthat is like giving a man a gun and disclaiming responsibility when someone is shot. Once\nthese effects are recognised in work that has\nbeen completed then the\nscientist must carefully\nconsider whether or not\nto publish the results,\nand have the courage to\nwithhold information and even to drop an entire\npiece of research if he\nthinks it will be detrimental to society at\nlarge. This has broader\nimplications in the\nchoice of a job or field\nof research \u2014 to weigh up the value of the work,\nand to refuse to undertake it if it is harmful to\nsociety at large. Ideally,\nevery scientist should be\nable to fully just iy his\nresearch to the general\npublic, because it is they\nwho will have to suffer\nits unforeseen consequences. There are two ways to\nensure that scientists\nand technologists bear\nthe social side of their\nwork in mind. One of\nthese is to form some\nprofessional body or\ncouncil to vet new devices and techniques before use; a similar body\nto the one mentioned\npreviously. The second,\npreferable, method is to\ngive a training in the\nsocial consequences of\nscience along with the\ntraining in scientific\nmethod. There are some\nUniversity courses along\nthese lines already (like\nthe ' Science, Technology and Society' and 'Environment and Man' courses here in I.C.) but\nthe object should be unified courses in which these matters are brought\nup as an integral part of\nthe course. In this way,\nscientists will be able to\nkeep their work in perspective, and society will benefit from it.\nThere is, however, a gap in the time scale between the present time\nand the time in the future when scientists and technologists have been\neducated to be socially\nresponsible \u2014 what is to\nhappen in this period of\nintense scientific effort?\nEach individual scientist\nmust take the responsibility on his own should-ers, and critically look at\nhis own work and that of\nothers, and decide whether or not it is justified.\nIf it is not, he must have\nthe courage to stop, and take his valuable skills\nand knowledge to a more\nresponsible field.\nStudents, Human\nBeings and Halls\nof Residence\nSir.\u2014As the editorial\nsuggests, Derek Cummings' blueprint for action certainly needs\nsome further comment.\nHe has assumed, first of\nall, that the answer to\nthe student housing\nproblem is more halls of\nresidence. Is this in fact\nthe right answer? Are\nstudent needs such that\nthey need to live in a little cube, in the middle\nof a hundred other little\ncubes, stacked one upon\nthe other in the mariner\nthat a child might stack\nhis first building bricks?\nWhy is it that the rest of\nthe population don't clam our to live in a similar\nway? Shouldn't students\nbe treated as people and\ngiven homes instead of\nunits of ac com moda tion? I 've no doubt that\nsome students do like\nliving in little cubes, but\ndon't we have enough\nalready. Future student\naccommodation should\nbe designed to cater for\nthe needs of students\nwho wish to live, not ex-ist.\nI think students, like\nother people, prefer to\nlive in small groups, but\nwith other students not\nfar away. The obvious\nanswer is some sort of\nstudent village. A flexible design would ensure\nthat students could live\nin groups of two or three\nor even groups of up to\nten or twelve. With some\nform of community c en tre, the village concept\nwould be complete. I accept that this type of accommodation would require slightly more space\nthan multi storey halls,\nbut even so a fairly high\ndensity could be achi ev ed. Students at Surrey\nUniversity can vouch for\nthe fact that living in\nsuch a village is very\npleasant, and if you\ndoubt that such a system\nis practical, I suggest a visit to Guildford would\nchange your mind. The\narchitects of the Surrey\nexperiment believe that\nstudents are people and\nhave designed their village accordingly. ! suggest it would be worth\ninviting the architects to\nthe Union to explain\ntheir ideas for students\naccommodation more\nfully than I am able.\nHaving discussed the\nquestion of whether\nmore halls are the ans\nwer, I feel that the rest\nof the article needs some\ndiscussion. Is it so revolutionary to borrow money from the banks to pay\nfor future student ac-com mod ation? I was under the impression that\nit was Tory government\npolicy that future student accommodation\nshould be loan financed?\nAnd with interest rates\nrunning at 9 per cent\nand rising, the suggested\ncost of a hall at \u00a31 million per 300 cubes\nmeans that the annual\ninterest repayment to our\nkind benefactors, the\nbanks, would be at least\n\u00a3300 per student. Assuming some of this is recoverable from conference letting s, what student could afford even\nhalf that amount w nen account has been taken\nof cleaning, electricity,\nrates and even capital re-payment, which would\nput the rent even higher.\nOf course all forms of\naccommodation will cost\nus a lot of money and\nthat is why students\nmust oppose all forms of\nloan financed accommodation, unless grants are\nraised to such an extent\nthat a decent standard\nof living can be achieved\nwithout subsidy.\nLastly on the question\nof rent strikes. Derek\nCummings thinks t nev will achieve very little.\nHe may be right. But I know that they can achieve a great deal. At this\ntime last year, the University of Sussex Tenants Association organised a little-publicised\nrent strike. This was to\noppose plans to build a totally inadequate loan-financed hall, but in\nplace to build accommodation to suit the needs\nof the students including\nflat lets to enable couples\nto live together if they\nso wish. This rent strike\nwas supported by about\n90 per cent of the tenants and after a couple\nof months of threats, the\nadministration agreed\nthat halls were not what\nthe students wanted, but\nwhat the conference organisers wanted. This\nraised the question of\nwhether accommodation\nwould be built to suit the\nneeds of students or con-ference s. The rent strike\nwas successful, and now\nno new hall will be built.\nInstead there will be\nmore suitable homes for\nstudents. Remember, a hall for 300 students is\nnot just 300 little cubes.\nAssuming a hall lasts\n100 years, it will have\npositively affected 30\nthousand students' lives.\nJOHN PORTER.\nHalls am\nWages\nSir\u2014How naive is our\npresident? I refer to his\ndrooling s in President's Column in the Christmas\nedition of \"Felix\". He ascertains that since college may be serving redundancies to cleaners,\nthe money college saves\nshould be reflected in a decrease in our hall fees.\nSurely college is only\nplanning to reduce the\ncleaner staff in order to\nkeep our hall bills\nstable? The cleaner staff\nis excessively large any-way: who needs their\nrooms cleaned every\nday?\nIf trade unionists stopped fighting for, and ob-tai ning, large wage in-creases, then hall bills\nwould not go up.\nOne man's wage increase is another's price\nincrease.\nYours, etc.,\nTIM BRADBURY\nYours\ntill hell\nfreezes ...\nDear Oily,\nWhat are you going to\ndo about all those herds\nof cows that have arrived in my office?\nYours,\nT.T.C. C.H., PAUL JO WITT. Our Guildford correspondent would like to express a personal opinion\non this article. Firstly,\ndoes Mr. Porter believe\nthat the halls of residence at Surrey are not\n'little cubes'? Does he,\nfurthermore, believe that\nthey are attractive? I have frequently heard\nthem referred to by various names, ranging from\n'beehives' to ' dolls' hous es' \u2014 and these names\nare not only conferred\nby Guildford residents,\nbut also by the students\nthemselves. Personally, I would rather live in an\nI.C. Hall, than in the\nSurrey complex. Is y mpa this e with the concept,\nbut please choose an other example!\n(By the way, does Mr. Porter know that Surrey\nis at present on a Rent\nStrike?)\n\n"

    "content": "8th JANUARY 1973\nNEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nFREE! No. 323\nRENT STRIKE\nSPECIAL\nEXTRA\nC IS ION THURSDAY The purpose of this special issue of \" Felix \" is to\ntell you about Rent Strikes, and why it is proposed\nthat we hold one in Imperial College.\nAt the end of last year, several provincial university\nunions decided that, since their hall fees were so high,\nand were greatly in excess of the \"notional element\" of\n\u00a3240 allowed for in the grant (\u00a3275 in London) they\nwould go on rent strike until increases scheduled on\nthese fees were cancelled and the fees tied to the\nmotion al element. Major centres were Surrey, Dundee\nand Keele.\nIt worked. So, at Margate Conference in November,\nNUS delegates from colleges all over Britain voted to\nuse the Rent Strike weapon in order to force the government to increase student grants. A call went out for\na national rent strike, and25 unions have already\nresponded positively. Ten more are discussing whether\nto hold one this week. That includes us.\nOn Thursday, at 1 p.m. in the Great Hall, aUG M will decide whether or not we should join the 25. The\nmotion that will be put to the Union is' printed below\nin its entirety. Elsewhere in this issue you can read how\nthe campaign was born at Margate Conference; John\nLane explains how a rent strike would work; we have a report of the Campaign Co-ordinating Committee (set\nup by the NUS) first meeting; and a report on how the\nrent strike at Surrey University last term worked.\nIn future weeks we shall be able to tell you how rent\nstrikes are working at other universities in Britain, or\nhow they are failing. This week a London Student\nPress Association team is visiting 8 Midlands universities, and their report will appear first in FELIX next\nweek. It is hoped that other teams will visit other parts\nof the country over the next few weeks.\nFinally, it might seem to you that having a rent strike\nis now a fait ac comp li, having read what appears in this\nissue. It is not. It is only a proposal.\nWHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE A RENT\nSTRIKE IS YOUR DECISION.\nYOU HAVE TO MAKE IT THIS THURSDAY.\nSEE YOU AT THE UNION MEETING\nTHEN.\nThe Notion\nImperial College Unioni reaffirm its demand for\n\"\u00a3100 increase in the grant now\" and \"the full grant\nfor all who study'\".\nIn the interests of a united campaign, l. C.U. pledges full backing to the immediate demands of\nthe N.U.S. for\n1. An end to the discretionary award system which\nallows local authorities to pay lower grants to\nmany students, particularly those in FE Colleges.2. An end to discrimination against married women\nstudents.\n3. An Interim grant increase of \u00a365 to cover the\ncost of inflation since 1971. *\n4. An annual grant review based on a student cost\nindex.\nThis union notes the \"secondary but no less im-port ant\" demand of the N.U.S. Margate Conference for higher grants for post-graduates. I.C.U. strongly urges N.U.S. Executive to give this demand\nmuch greater priority and itself resolves to treat it\nas equal to the above four.\nl. C.U. notes the rent strikes by nine student unions\nlast term and those proposed by twenty-five unions\nthis term, and expresses its whole-hearted solidarity\nwith all unions on rent strike, whether against excessive rents or for higher gran jt s as part of the NUS campaign.\nl. C.U., observing the reduced taxation of the rich\nand big business concerns and the increased expenditure on armaments by the Heath administration\nbelieves that higher grants should be financed from\nthese sources rather than by further taxation on\nworking people.\nl. C.U. withdraws the voluntary levy of 35p per\nweek paid by students in hall towards the cost of\nnew halls and calls for all future buildings to be\nfinanced by a wealth tax.\nl. CU. resolves on a two-pronged campaign aiming\n1. to win public support, and in particular that of\nthe organised working class, for our claim to demonstrate the united anger of 600,000 students\nat the deterioration in our living standards and\nthus make it politically very difficult for the\ngovernment to reject our demands.\n2. to use the only economic power we have, the\nability to withhold hall and house rents, to force\nthe college authorities to put intense pressure on\nthe Government to concede our claim.\nl. CU. therefore mandates\n1. the President, Executive and Council to organise\nsupport for the N.U.S. grants campaign, in particular for\nthe USK area activities\nthe London demonstration on Feb. 21st the National Day of Action on March14 th.2. the President and Departmental Representatives\nto organise departmental meetings to discuss the\nGrants Campaign.\n3. Union members in hall or house to pay their\nrents bill less \u00a33.85 new halls levy into a special\nrent strike fund the contents of which will not\nbe paid to the college unless a resolution of an\nI.C. Union Meeting so instructs.\n4. this meeting to elect a committee to organise a rent strike.\n5. the President to inform the media, Norman St.\nJohn Stevas, M.P., Secretary of State at the\nDepartment of Education and Science, Lord\nPenney, the N.U.S. and all unions involved in rent strikes, Hammersmith Trades Council, the\nBriants' \" Work in\" and the trade unions in I.C. of this resolution with a view to obtaining their\nsupport.\n\n"

Next\nyear they won't be in hall,\nnext year they will have\nto pay sky-high London\nrents. It is then that a student in London really feels\nthe pinch. Some are lucky\nenough to be in hall more\nthan two years, but they\nare not a majority and I hope they will support\ntheir fellOw students in the\ncampaign.\nThe National Campaign\nThis envisages three\nphases. In late January\nand early February area-based actions \u2014 in our\ncase all USK colleges \u2014\nideas suggested so far in clude a total refectory boy-cott,a lobby of Parliament, mass leaflet distribution/ petition signing\nsession in High Street.\nKensington.

Are we doing\ndown the Old Age Pensioners or the low-paid\nworkers? In fact, in1972 according to the Financial\nTimes, profits increased\nby 17%, the highest in crease since 1969. It has\nbeen Government policy\nto cut taxes on the\nwealthy, and VAT will increase the 'burden of in direct taxation which hits\nthe low-paid (like stu-dents) hardest.\nSo we have to tell the\nordinary people of this\ncountry, the Old people,\nthe poor, the workers\nfighting for higher wages\nor against redundancy that\nwe are not demanding\nhigher grants at their expense but from the profits\nof the industrial concerns\nwho will, after all, benefit\nfrom our skills when we\nstart work.\n101.5 105.3 107.8 113.0 117.1 118.2 125.8 132.2 141.5 155.5 166.4 176.6?\nRemember\nRENT STRIKE ?\nIT'S YOUR\nDECISION\nMake it Thursday\n1300\nGreat Hall\nThis Rent Strike Special Extra issue of FELIX, being the 3 2 3 rd of that\nname and dated Monday the8 th January 1 9 7 3 was conceived by ICU Executive (bless their little cotton socks) and written and produced in living colour by Oliver Dow son( Editor), Mary Dunne, John Lane, Martin Black, S.J.

    "content": "Page 8 FELIX January 8, 1973\nREMEMBER U. G.M* THURSDAY\n1300 GREAT HALL\nSurrey succeed\nwith 60%\nsupport\nMore to Grants Campaign\nthan Rent Strikes\nThe students at Surrey University are at present\nrunning one of the most successful rent strikes in the\ncountry. After one tenn they were able to report 6 0 %\nsupport for their strike\u2014that is, 60% of all students at\nSurrey had paid into the Rent Fund. \u00a344,250 had been\ncollected from 950 residents by 13th December, 1972.\nIln fact, support for the strike is even greater than this,\nas less than 20% of students have paid the University.\nAnd it should be remembered that, as rents are paid on\na termly basis at Surrey, the Rent Fund could conceivably double as this term progresses.\nWhen I asked Mel Ingram (President of the\nStudents' Union) and Iain\nMorrison (Chairman of\nthe Rent Action Committee) the reason for their\nsuccess at Surrey, their\nanswer was simple; hard\nwork, and careful organ-is ation. When the rent\nstrike started it was necessary to educate the mass\nof students as to the issues\ninvolved. Newsheets were\n(and are still being) printed regularly. Posters were\ndesigned and displayed all\nover the University. Pickets were appointed to\nstand outside the Cashier's Office (where students\nwould normally pay their\nrents) to attempt to persuade them to pay into the\nRent Fund instead. A video film was made showing Union officials trying\nto negotiate with University Authorities. Volunteers were found to distribute leaflets. And, probably most important of all,\na door-to-door survey was\nundertaken to discover\nthe extent of support, and\nto try to persuade those\nwho had not yet paid anyone to pay into the Rent\nFund. This was a mammoth task, as it involved\nknocking on1,600 doors,\nbut it had positive results\nin that 77 more students\npaid after they had been\nvisited personally.\nOne more factor which\nhas been of great assistance to the strike organisers is that Surrey is a Campus University. This\nhas obviously helped, especially as far as communication is concerned,\nbut it has not meant that\nnon-residents have not\nbeen involved in the struggle. Non-residents are, in\nfact, attending Union\nGeneral Meetings (at the\nrate of two a week!) and\nhave been giving the\nstrikers all possible sup-port.\nAt the beginning of the\nSurrey strike a Rent Fund\nConstitution was drawn\nup which has been rigidly\nadhered to. This lays\ndown the only uses to\nwhich the money can be\nput to pay the University\nin the event of the strike\nbeing settled, or to reimburse any person who\nwishes to withdraw his\ncontribution. It also states\nthat the Fund shall be\nopen to inspection by any\nmember of the Union, and\nthat accounts should be\npresented to a General\nMeeting at least once\nevery two weeks. It is\nworth noting that on average Surrey is holding General Meetings twice a week at the moment, and\nthat these Meetings continue to be quo rate. Now Surrey is trying to\nidentify its local efforts\nwith the national Gramts\ncampaign. Members of\nthe University are visiting\nother Colleges to give\nthem the benefit of their\nval u a b1e experience.\nSpeakers have already\nbeen sent to Hull, Keele,\nAston, Birmingham, Reading and Bath. Surrey University has been successful\nso far. It remains to be\nseen how many other Universities Will be able to drum up sufficient enthusiasm to follow in their\nfootsteps.\nOnly sixteen\nat C.C.C. On the 16th December 1972 the Campaign Co-ordinating Committee met at U.L. U.( University of London Union) to discuss the probable outline of the Grants\nCampaign as it could take place this term. Digby Jacks\n(President N.U.S.) presented a paper to the C.C.C. which divided the campaign into 4 phases.\nThe first phase has already started, and includes\nthe rent strikes which have\nbeen taking place in the\nlast term, for example at\nSurrey, Keele and Exeter.\nPhase 2 will begin towards the end of la nua ry. It will involve activity by\nstudents on the three priorities of the grants cam-pa ign: the main rate of\ngrants, discretionary\nawards and married\nwomen students' grants.\nThe activity envisaged includes not only rent\nstrikes and catering boy-cot ts, but also lobbying of\nM.P.s and, possibly, of\nLocal Education Authorities. Such action should\nbe organised on a local\nbasis.\nPhase 3 should take\nplace in mid February.\nThis is to be a unified\nnational campaign. It is\nhoped that 3 or 4 regional\ndemonstrations can be\norganised, in such places\nas London, Cardiff, Ed in burgh and Birmingham,\nalthough the venues are,\nas yet, provisional. Such\ndemonstrations wo u Id\nshow the unity of and\nmass support for the cam-pa ign. Wednesday, 21st February has been suggested as a possible date\nfor this.\nThe campaign would\nreach a climax with phase\n4, towards the end of this\nterm. If previous support\nhas been sufficient either\na national Day of Action or a national strike will be\ncalled in mid March. These then were the\nproposals put by the\nN.U.S. Executive (in the\nshape of Digby Jacks) to\na C.C.C. which consisted\nof p red is ely16 members.\nIt seems incredible that\nthere were not more\npeople present at a meeting which had to decide\nmatters of great importance to the grants cam-pa ign. One could not help\nfeeling that if this was\nrepresentative of support\nfor the campaign, the\nN.U.S. will not have to\norganise that national\nstrike in March. FELIX EDITOR\nELECTIONS ARE\nSOON !\nIf you fancy a sabbatical\nyear, join Felix now\nand find out what it's all about. You will be\nwelcome.\nAs was reported briefly in the 5th December issue of\n\" Felix\", the NUS National Conference at Margate in November passed a large and comprehensive motion\non Grants. It called for an immediate increase in the\nmandatory rate of grant to cover rises in the cost of\nliving since the last award: the NUS Executive is asking for \u00a365 which would restore the grant to the 1968\nsettlement level (which restored the 1962 level). Other\nmajor demands were\n% an end to discrimination against married\nwomen students in grants assessment (at\npresent, married women\nget \u00a3275 p.a. \u2014 single\nwomen get \u00a3480).\n:js the abolition of discretionary awards \u2014 and\nan especial call for the\ndesignation of the\nHigher National Diploma ( H ND) and other\nnon-designated advanced courses. (Explanation\nfor the uninitiated:\nThere are designated\nand nora-de si gnat ed courses. Designated\ncourses \u2014 like degree\ncourses at Universities\nand Polytechnics\u2014carry\nwith them a mandatory\ngrant level, which is\npaid to all students re-gard less.

They have produced not only a White Paper (which did more than just give money to build nursery schools) but also a Finance Report. Read on... Cost-cutting\nand shorter courses\nWhite Paper on Education\nA jump from 463,000 to 750,000 in the numbers of\nstudents and22% of eighteen-year-olds in further education are the major aims for higher education set\nforth in the Government White Paper published in December*. The main expansion would take place in the Polytechnics who, the Government hopes, will take\nthe same number of students as the Universities\n(375,000) by 1981. The number of part-time students\nwould increase considerably, but the percentage of\npost-graduates would fall from 19% of students to 17%\n(an increase in numbers of only 7,000 over the next ten\nyears).\nThe White Paper suggests a need for a shorter\ncourse than current first\ndegree courses, and proposes a2 year course leading to a Diploma of\nHigher Education (Dip\nHE). This would be of\ncomparable difficulty to\nthe first two years of a first degree course, could\nbe offered at both Polytechnics and Universities,\nand would carry a mandatory grant to students\nwith it. A considerable\nnumber of students opting\nto take the Dip HE in stead of a three-year\ncourse would reduce the\nnumber of places required\nin HE institutions, and\nthus cut costs. Cutting\ncosts is a major preoccupation of the White Paper.\nNotwithstanding this,\nthe White Paper contains\nproposals to build a further 11,000 units of student accommodation in74/75. Places should be\navailable for about two-thirds of the additional\nstudents expected in the\ncurrent quin que n niu m(197277). However, the\nWhite Paper says that \"the\nGovernment shares the\nfrequently-expressed view\nthat it is unrealistic and\nunnecessary for such a high proportion of students to reside and study\nat a distance if equally\nacceptable courses are\navailable to them within\ndaily travelling distance of\ntheir homes\" and suggests\nthat Universities and institutions of Advanced\nHigher Education should\nlay great emphasis on\nhome-based students.\nThe Government believes that since one of the\nbiggest costs of higher education is that of employing teaching staff, economies should be made here,\nand the staff/student ratio\nshould be reduced to 10:1.\nThey suggest that \" a gradual transition to this\naverage figure should be\npossible without lowering\nBye, bye, Binary\nThe Education and Arts sub-committee of the House\nof Commons Expenditure Committee published their\nreport on further and higher education on Wednesday,\nDecember 20th. If accepted, the report would mean\nan end to the binary system of financing higher edu-cation, an aim that student organisations have been\nfighting for for many years. At present, the Universities\nand Colleges apply for their money from a central body,\nthe University Grants Committee ( UD G), which is\ngiven a certain amount of money by the Government\nto dole out amongst the Universities. Polytechnics, Colleges of Education, and other Higher Education institutions get their money from the Local Authorities.\nThe Expenditure Report recommends that all Higher\nand Further Education be brought together under one\nfinancing authority similar to the UGC: a \"Higher\nEducation Commission\".\nstandards\".\nRecently Mrs. Thatcher,\nSecretary of State for\nEducation, ruled such a possibility out as \"admin-is tr at iv ely in practicable\". But Mr. Neil Marten,\nChairman of the Sub-Committee, said that were it\nsolely an administrative\ndifficulty it could be over-come.\nHome-based students\nThe report suggests that\nthe universities be initially\ngiven a few years to increase the number of\nhome-based students, and\nif they do not succeed the\nGovernment would be\njustified in taking tougher\nmeasures. These measures\ncould include not providing any more purpose-built student accommodation, universities not being allowed to accept students from outside their\nown region unless they can\nguarantee accommodation\nin halls of residence or\napproved lodgings, giving\npriority to students from\ndifficult home backgrounds and the expansion of institutions with\nlarge local catchment\nareas.\nLoans for U/G' s rejected\nThe committee said that\nsince, were a loan scheme\nfor undergraduates to be\nintroduced, it could not be\ndone without numerous\nexceptions and special\ncases, it should not be considered a practicality at\nthe moment. The report\ndid not, however, entirely\nrule out the idea. Although\nyet to be fully invest ig at ed, the Committee did suggest that loans for postgraduates might be a welcome scheme.\nUCC A extended\nThe Universities Central\nCouncil on Admissions\n( UCC A) should be extended to serve all institutions of higher and further\neducation, suggests the re-port. At present, polytechnics and colleges of\neducation have to be applied to separately and\nindividually.\nA National Manpower\nCouncil should be set up\nto advise students about\nthe demand for qualified\nmanpower. A Careers Advisory service for scholars\ninterests in going into\nhigher education should\nbe included, to tell them\nwhat jobs are offered for\nwhich qualifications.\nEnd to Quinquennial\nsystem\nAt present universities\nwork on \" The Quinquennial Plan\", i.e. they receive\nan allocation of money\nevery five years for the\nnext five years' work. The Committee suggests that\ninstead of this a five-year\nrolling plan co-ordinated\nwith and on the lines of\nthe public expenditure\nsurveys. The committee\nexpects that expenditure\nfor three years ahead\ncould probably be firmly\nfixed, and the next two\nyears reasonably accurately forecasted.\nMy dear Edward j On joining Europe\n-tc\n*\n*\n-K \u2022XXX**X** K** XX**XX* XXX XX**XX XXX \u2022XXXX XXXX XXXX X \u2022XXXX XXXX XXX DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE. WHITEHALL. I st April1974 My dear Edward,\nAs you are aware we at the D.E.S. have long been troubled by the activities\nof a small group of your subjects. I refer of course to the students at present\nattending the Universities.\nIam therefore delighted to inform you of the details of the White Paper we\nare to publish next month entitled 'In Place of Struggle'.\nThe Paper outlines the new structure of degree courses as from next September. The basic principle behind the scheme is to give students their long\nawaited parity \u2014 financial and otherwise \u2014 with their peers in industry and\noffices.\nFinancial parity is achieved by paying the students a salary of between\n\u00a320-\u00a325 per week on a sliding scale according to age.\nStudents will attend lectures for 40 hours per week and be given the usual\n3 weeks annual holiday. This will result in the same amount of time being\nallotted to lectures and tutorials as under the present system of a3 year\ndegree course. However, this scheme is based on one year's study to an\nhonours degree.\nIam advised by my colleagues in the Treasury that this could result in\neither a cut of 5 0 % on higher education spending, or a rise of 100% in the\nnumber of graduates\u2014I know which one you will prefer Tel !\nToo good to be true, you say, but will public opinion allow us to pass the\nBill? Never fear, after last year's rash of student rent strikes and militancy,\npublic opinion has never been more solidly behind us in our struggle against\nthe student.\nHoping the above meets with your approval,\nI remain your humble servant,\nMaggie.\nThe author would like to state that the figures quoted in this letter are quite\nrealistic.\nx*xx*x xx*xx x*xxx* xxx XXXX-*\nXXXX-XXX XXXXXXXX-*\nXXXXXX-X XXX-X XX-X XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XX 'This royal throne of kings, this sceptre d isle,\nThis earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,\nThis other Eden, demi-paradise,\nThis fortress built by nature for herself\nAgainst infection and the hand of war,\nThis happy breed of men, this little world,\nThis precious stone set in the silver sea,\nWhich serves it in the office of a wall,\nOr as a moat defensive to a house,\nAgainst the envy of less happier lands.\nThis blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.'\n(Richard II)\nWill it ever be the same again . . \u2022 ?\n\n"
