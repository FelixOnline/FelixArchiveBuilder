    "content": "2 FELIX\nGENERAL STUDIES THE CHANCELLOR'S SPEECH\nMr. Heathcoat Amcry, in his su-n nary of the economic outlook at home and ab-road, presented an optimistic picture\nof our future prospects, but at the\nsame time he stressed that we mist not\nlapse into complacency.\nAll efforts of the Governments\n3ince the war to put our economy on a firm basis have been frustrated by\ninflation, until recently: the rising\ncrisis last Autumn was largely due to\ninfluences abroad, but it was countered by the l* hbo nk rate and the top\npriority given to the elimination\nof inflation. There has also been\na fall in import prices which has\nmore than bal an oed our fall in exports,\nand the result is the best situation\nfor sterling since the war: our gold\nand dollar reserves have risen by \u00a347CM during the last year (partly achieved\nby a loan of \u00a370M and by a lapse of\npayments to the U.S. and Canada), and\nsterling debts have been reduced?by\n\u00a3300M. Internally, the Chancellor's aims\nare threefold:\na) to maintain the str ng th of sterling\nb) to keep prices stable.\na) to maintain the highest possible\nlevel of production and employment.\nHare he took the opportunity of\nappealing to his audience to stop\neating potatoes, as these were the one\nitem rao3 t likely to rise in price due\nto the bad crops this year!\nThe greatest danger is the increase\nof wages, dividends and profits: the\nformer have risen by 4$ over the last\nyear, wh i oh is a higher figure than\nthat for the cost of living or the rise\nin production: if this occurs during\nthe next year we are likely to be\npriced out of the world markets, for\nat the moment industrial pro duo tion is lower than last year, and is unlikely to improve in the next few\nmonths.\nLORD MAYORS SHOW Fewer Guildsmen than usual participated in the procession this year,\nas the majority of the floats were\nmanned by the Territorials. Bo and a supporting company assembled, as they\nare wont, on Ludgate Hill where they\nentertained the crowd in the in im it i ble fashion we have come to erp eot t to\nquote the DAILY EXPRESS \" a crowd of\nstudents on Ludgate Hill put the sold\ni ers out of step.....\"\nThe new Lord Mayor received the\nloyal greetings of City and Guilds\nCollege through the sonorous medium\nof a Boomalaka.\nAfter the procession, C*G paid\na visit to that small place in the\nStrand, but finding little of interest,\nleft for L.S.E. But not before Mary\nand Jane had casually removed the King's flag, and a trouser lens resident had\nbeen looked into the girls common-room.\nAlso, the national figure\nof 2.3^ for unemployment is low in\ncomparison with that for most other\noo un tries. This is a serious problem because of its concentration In\ncertain areas such as South Wales and\nMersey side: on tn is sub j eot Mr.\nAmory said that while the \"over n ment extended grants to in dust rie. settling\nup in areas of high unemployment, rie did\nnot think it was his responsibility to\nmaintain the 3ize of any particular\nindustry - we must develop new industries according to demand with the\nlabour force from the old ones, end\nleave the si pie manufacturing processes\nto less developed oo un tries. In answer to a question on Gow\nern ment controls, the Chancellor\nreplied that direct o on tro ls lead to\nhoarding and hence achieve a different result to that intended: it was\nbetter for him to encourage the productive industries rather than the\nconsumptive ones, and to reduce the back\nrate as far as possible.\nTo another question about agri cul ture, he gave three reasons for the fact\n-that it( in coming with steel) is a favoured industry: in two world ware\nwe have nearly starved to <iea th, the\neconomic consideration dicta ts d by\nan un-bala no e of payments, and the\nsocial reason of maintaining a bal-an oe between town and country. The\nGovernment subsidy ensures thai the\nPublic doesn't pay mare than wo rid prices for food*\nIn conclusion Mr. Amory repeated\nhis belief in a free economy: decisions are better taken by the men in\no on tro l of industry than by a minister\nin Westminster.\nSABOTAGE THE GUILD'S FLOAT\nSeeing the maddening horde approaching, L.S. S. barred their gates and so\nthe Guildamen retired to the Enbankment\nAn advance party infiltrated into the\nenemy's camp and a determined attack\nwas made on their Union. Fierce fighting ensued but the entrance to \"Beaver\"\nwas blocked by an impregnable wall of\nfire-extinguishers. Finding that their\nstrength was being wasted, the attackers\nwithdrew, and after a few Parthian shots\ndescended upon a hostelry for purposes\nof recuperation.\nHews was later received of the unfortunate Guildsman who became isolated\nfrom the main body during the fighting-He was transported, trouser less, into\nPicadilly Circus and released the r in. His appearance provoked considerable\nspeculation among the residents, but\ntheir worst fears were o on founded when\nhe immediately caught a taxi back to\nI.C. The annual conflagration and hopeful burning of \"Chubby\" (in effigy only)\nwas overshadowed by the I.C. Lunar\nProbe - a splendid, gleaming machine\ninstalled on a launching pad in the\ncentre of open ground.\nThe rocket launching was complete\ndown to the last detail - periodic\nannouncements over the loudspeaker\nsystems were accompanied by realistic\ntaped sound-effects, intended to build\nup anticipation towards aero-hour,\n9,30. They were also necessary to\nwarn people away from the infernal\nmachine - considering the contents and\nthe preparations that went before it, a vm ry necessary precaution, as denizens\nof the first floor Had come to know for\nsome 14 days previously.\nBetween them, the Chairman of the\nEntertainments Committee and an ex-President of the Dram. Soc, produced the\nbiggest smog ever known at I.e., together with periodic detonations\nwhich left shattered nerves and blackened ceilings. Finally whan the experimenters were satisfied the rocket\nwas assembled - the main charge being\na waste bin of gunpowder (and, it is rumoured, 2 gallons of petrol).\nHence the warning.\nWhen the long-awaited countdown was oar r led out, the rocket\nproduced very little in the way of a show - the sound effects far surpassing\nthe visual. After a hurried invest-ig ation, an announcement was made that\na re-test of the rocket would be carried\nout: before most people had a oha no e to look in the right direction, Harlington, (and probably London Airport\ntoo; was shaken by an explosion that\nWoomera would not be ashamed of.\nWhy, after suo h preparations\nand calculations, had the rocket mis-fired? It was not the fault of\nbutton-pusher John Sheldon, be assured\nof that. Sabotage was the answer.\nThe button closed the circuit not to the\nProbe, but to an inferior version strapped to its side - attached by person or\npersons unknown, under the impression\nthat it is vary funny to ruin the result\nof hard and devoted work, and all the\nmore funny when suo h sabotage is carried\nout xl th such a large and appreciative\naudi sn ce. To those who made the Probe, o on gra til at ions at least the final explosion was s pact acul ar enough ; to\nthose who attempted sabotage, try to\nshow more intelligence and a sense of\noccasion.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 5\nLETTERS ENGLISH\nDear Sir,\nI was interested to read the\ncontribution 'The .Queens English' in your previous issue; I feel it brings\nout very well an attitude which is very prevalent in academic circles\nand one with which I disagree.\nStarting by confessing uncertainty\nas to why we are here at all which\nis understandable if he regards the\n'Science & Technology' of our title as \"Scientific ir rel avanc ies\" your\ncontributor continues to ask \"What is\nan education?\", concluding that it is a process aimed at turning the student\ninto a 'benefit to humanity' - presumably on a plane with mains water and\nsewage farms, not a tool to enable the\nstudent to obtain a larger share of the\ngood things of life which is why\nmost of U3 are here,if we bother to\nthink about it. Our training is aimed at enabling\nus to produce something which others\nwill buy. Frequently this requires a jargon, almost a foreign language,\namong our colleagues for Queen's Engl is his not a suitable tool - but we\nhave only to say to our oust omer 'Here\nit is, it works*. If it does not work\nit is best buried without a report in\nimpeccable English,for life is too short.\nLanguage is, at best, an inadequate tool, a living thing which constantly changes to meet our needs but\nnever catches up the flying thoughts\nit strives to express. We augment the\nwritten word with many forme of symbolic notation of which mathematics\nand the engineers drawing are perhaps\ngood examples.\nThe only valid test of a word is does it express the required meaning?\nA sausage, as ossi ge or even as ozz id ge are very similar under the skin, even\nShakespeare spelt his own name in\nseveral ways.\nPerhaps num pty Dumpty went too\nfar when he said \"When 1 use a word\nit means just what I want it to mean\",\nbut every writer of a report should\nhave always before him the next remark\n\"The question is, w hio his to be Master\n- that's all\". Tours faithfully.\nS. W.O. Iverraee.\nEditors' Note:\nWhich conclusively proves Mr. Taylor's Point.\nFOR SALE - 1956 B.S.A. D3 150 C.C. BANTAM MAJOR with s/ arm rear sus pen sion. Good nick, goes like the\nclappers. \u00a360 o.n.o. Wanted literature on Scotts (1957 approx.)\nJ.P. Billingham 2A e. KULCHER\nDear Sir,\nIn various parts of your last issue it was revealed that -a) the College is overcrowded\nb) the refectories are 'chronically'\ncongested ( it is often qu ioke r to go\nto one of the cheap caff's around Gloucester/Road, but the proletarian clientele is already complaining of over-or ew ding, and a spirit of revolution is\nin the air.)\nc) many of the students are semi-illiterate. d) the vast majority cannot take their\ndrink like gentlemen, and\ne) Mooney is steadily losing apparatus.\nAnd Mr. Taylor is alarmed that the\nCollege no longer requires a pass at 0-Level in Eng. Lang. So am I. As I see it, there are two possible solutions to our problems. The first is of\ncourse to make entrance requirements more\nstringent) preferably eliminating i dio ts, drunks and kleptomaniacs. To do\nthis, 0-Level Eng. Lit. and an un blemished Scouting record might be adequate.\nThe second solution, which would only\noccur to a man of genius, would be to\neliminate people like Literate John\nTaylor, Gentleman John Braaley and, above\nall, myself - I'm sorry I came, really.\nMay I suggest that only those who have\nactually failed 0-Level Eng. Lang, should be admitted.\nhere,\nHaving wonderful time, wish you were\nFred (String) Wheeler.\nHALLS OF RESIDENCE\nDear Sir,\nWe the undersigned would like to\nsuggest that there is a good case\nto be made -for the inclusion of Constituent College Halls of Residence in\nthe plans for the Princes Gardens site.\nWe are concerned that at no stage in\nthe development of these plans have the\nConstituent College Unions been consulted about a question wh i oh is so\nfundamental to their survival.\nThere is general agreement that\nsmaller units are likely to command\ngreater loyalties than the large and\namorphous Imperial College Union.\nThe controversy is concerned with the\ncomposition of these units. We suggest\nthat the most effective division should\ntake account of both our traditions and\nour learning, and we believe that we\nshould preserve the status quo with\nregard to the Constituent Colleges.\nThe Colleges embody almost all of\nthe tradition which is assembled under\nthe name of Imperial College. There\nis no doubt in our minds that the separation of students into Halls of Residence on any arbitrary principle will\nmean the effective end of the Constituent Colleges. We believe that this\nwould be a bad thing for the Imperial\nCollege.\nWe remain, sir,\nYours etc.\nE.A. Warwioker\nGraham King\nPeter Kassler\nP.E. Emerson\nLVF. Butters\nF.D. Stevens\nJohn A. Nation\nI.M. Plummer\nNELSON'S COLUMN\nContrary to general opinion, it appears that somebody does read this\ncolumn, far Nelson has received the\nfollowing letter:-Dear Sir,\nI would like to o orr eot an item\nof news which appeared in the last\nNelson's Column. Firstly, Peter\nSoott became a father after his term\nof office as Entertainments Officer for\nMines, and secondly, my wife has already had the baby which was reported\nas being expected.\nR. S.M.U. Entertainments Officer.\nThis is a very interesting letter\nfrom Mr. Rsmu, especially the last\ninformation, which is unique, for\nthis is the first known case of a baby\nbeing born before it was expected.\nWho said I.C. was backward?\nOne of the Editors is sharing\na new girl friend called Belinda; he\nsays that, although she's a bit 'slow\nto start, once hot, she turns over\nwonderfully.\nWe hear that there is a move to\nthrow labourers out of the bar when they\ncome in for a drink and ask to have\ntheir helmets filled. It seems\nthat Soottie can't get the brim under\nthe pump.\nI THINK THEY OUGHT TO MAKE IT|\nA NATIONAL HOLIDAY.\n\n"

In addition to the inevitable barrage of flour\nand mod, R.C.S. were further disconcerted to find themselves subjected\nto an ignominious as sul t from decaying,\nfly-blown pears. Indeed, some of their\nnumber taking exception to this putri fy ing presence, were rather glad of their\nimpromptu bathe in the swollen Thames.\nThe Presidents were transported\nas usual to the scene of the crime by\ntheir respective chariots Bo, Jez and\nClem: the advent of the latter was\nfollowed by the most amazing sight\nof the afternoon. Graham King, the\nMines President, began to wade knee-deep into the water, with umbrella aloft\n( it wasn't even raining at the time)\nand perched upon a fence, the floodwaters swirling about his feet. This\npeculiar behaviour was motivated by the\narrival of the Miners' launch, which\neventually took him aboard. Unfortunately Graham is endowed with little sense of the dramatic, for he did not\nfall in: anyone with the merest\nstreak of artistry would have done so.\nAn official declaration of war,\nand the 'Battle of the towpath bridge\"\nbegan. After bitter fighting, Theta\nwas o apt u red by the Guildsmen, who then\nstaged a strategic withdrawal, triumphantly fl ci uri shing their booty aloft.\nA truce was called on this unholy struggle for the purpose of o hee ring the\ncrews in the Lowry Cup race, in which\nR.C.S. pipped Guilds by a small margin.\nThe activities in the intervening period\nbetween this and the Morphy race might\nadequately be termed \"aqua-sport\".\nFortunes varied from the sublime - Mr.\nLeston flung bodily into the Thames,\nemerging, and being flung back again;\nto the ridiculous - a pathetic figure\nclutching two halves of a pair of sodden jeans and protesting weakly: \"It's not cricket, you know.\" How right he\nwas.\nXandra, the lovely Queen of Jez,\ncould resist the advances of the determined Guildsmen no longer and was spirited away into their alien midst.\nEnraged at this das tartly move, R.C.S. launched a vicious counter-attack,\nand even the superior numbers of the\nGuildsmen could not withstand the fury\nof the onslaught. Dave Clark was\nisolated and ceremonially jettisoned\nTHE SEQUEL If any of you happened to be\nwalking along KxhibitionRd. at\n7.0 a.m. on the 13th, you would have\nwitnessed a strange sight - the President of R.C.S. pulling a handcart,\npushed by Mr. Gamett, who, in turn,\nwas pushed by the Editor. Obviously some pertinent explanation is called\nfor.\nTho previous night, i.e. Morphy\nnight, a band of R.C.S. revellers\nwere racking their besotted brains for\nse me appropriate method of ending the\ncelebrations. Quite by chance they\ncame upon an old car resting wearily\nagainst the Roderio Hill Building.\nHow nice, they thought, if this could\nbe overturned in front of Guilds.\nAccordingly, they propelled the vehicle the no e and swept it into a tidy\nheap on the steps. To complete the\noperation, they roped off the area,\nplanted a few pickaxes amongst the\nwreckage and surrounded it with red\nlamps; then the culprits disappeared.\nAll was silence - the lamps tinting the stream of petrol meandering\nlazily in the direction of the Underground Station.\nThe advent of the porter was\nfollowed by the police and a fire-engine, to wash off the petrol from the\npavement. A dishevelled labourer, who\nprofessed ownership of the car informed\nthe officer that he thought it must have\nbeen a student prank - as if they needed\ntelling!\nAt 6.40 a.m. that Thursday morning,\nthe first floor'phone shattered the\ndelicate silence of the Hostel: the\nnight watchman wished to inform the\nPresident that, unless oe rta in ropes,\npickaxes and lamps w gre returned by breakfast time, I.C. was going to be prosecuted - Hence the unprecedented early\nmorning exercise.\ninto the unfriendly Thames.\ndripping Presidential coat gave a few\ncurt orders and, in next to no time, the\nopposing President was spewing fi3 h and\nfungi from the same waters.\nDave Clark, perhaps feeling that\nhe was unsuitably attired for a further dip, changed his clothes and was\naccordingly returned to the overstocked\nriver. The lot of a President is\nindeed arduous.\nThe end of the Morphy cup race\nappropriately terminated the afternoon'3\nEntertainment.\n\n"

The\n\"Challenge to Christianity\" scheduled\nfor delivery by Mr. J.E. Coates turned\ninto a challenge to Humanism: -while\ncasting doubts on various basic\ntenets of Christianity, the speaker\nheld that Humanism was failing in its task of providing a set of moral\nvalues suited to the present day.\nEthics and polit ios could not be separated, as the Church seemed to think;\nthe fundamental political issues of our\nday are et hio al, and the Humanists\nshould lead the way.\nAlmost the entire audience at the\njoint meeting of the Huxley Soc. and\nthe S. C.M. took part in the discussion\non the Lambeth Conference. While the\nresults of the Conference seemed to betoken a more humanistic attitude on\nthe part of the Church, the Christians\nresisted attempts to convince them that\nthe Bible 3hould be done away with.\nHeathens who preferred a more humani-tio replacement - e.g., a concensus -tended to get slaughtered.\nDr. Charles Bibby, whose biography\nof T.H. Huxley should appear next April,\ngave an entertaining and interesting\naddress on the subject of \"T.H. Huxley,\nSoientist and Humanist\". T.H. H. had\nleft school at an early age and did not\ngo to university; nevertheless, or\nconsequently, he developed into a man\nof great character and vast intellectual stature. Among other exploits,\nhe engaged in duels with Mr. Gladstone\nin the columns of THE TIMES, the then\nPrime Minister usually emerging very\nmuch the worse for wear, in spite of\nthe fact that Huxley's letters were not\ninfrequently re tur red fox toning down\nbefore the Editor would dare to print\nthem.\nIn Dr. Bibby's opinion, Huxley\nwould have thought very little of the\npresent set-up of I.C. In 1881, part\nof the function of R.C.S. was to train\nScience teachers. and Huxley considered\nthis a vital \"role, His views on education were quite definite, and admitted\nby his clerical antagonists to be sound;\nthey are to a large extent embodied in our present day educational system.\nCOMMENT Incidentally, the 1958-59 Calendar\nrefers to Huxley as a vigorous supporter\nof the \"broader policy\" of \"the diffusion of sci eno e generally as applied to\nproductive industry\". This is a most\nnovel concept of ''broad\", and the Administration is to be congratulated on\nwhat is probably the first original idea\nit has had since Huxley died. While\nthe hacks who oom piled this \"Short History of the College\" have credited\nHuxley with \"ideas and personality\",\nthey have carefully omitted any mention of what these ideas were (apart\nfrom the nonsense quoted above), even\nthough his views on the training of\nteachers, for example, were implemented\nin the curriculum of the Normal School\nof Science. His ideas were too unconventional to last. P.B. Levin.\nBEES IN YOUR BOTANY\nTed Hill, a well-known figure in the\nGeology Department, is a laboratory\nSuperintendent but it was not for this\nthat our o on ten rp or ary THE TIKES chose\nto publish his photo gra uh.

With things like bees kept\nunder our very noses (as it were) it is high time that the presence of any other\nstrange creatures was brought to the\nnotice of the students.\nOn the afternoon of 5th Nov.\nas a result of a well organised raid,\ncarried out by a number of geologists,\nthe \"carrot\" wa3 abducted from N.E.C., brought back to South Kensington, painted in the colours of the Royal College\nof Soienoe and displayed the following\nday in the entrance hall of R.C.S. It was proposed that Mr. Heathcoat\n' Amory,who was giving a lecture that\nlunch hour, would be asked to auto-grab h this weird specimen, but this\ndid not materialise.\nAn attempt by Guilds to steal the\nobject was forestalled by its removal\nto the hostel, since this would only\nhave resulted in a fight, causing no\ndoubt, as other inter-college rags have\ndone in the past, a great deal of dam-age; as well as disturbing a rather\ndistinguished visitor.\nTHE CARROT\nHaving heard well-founded rumours\nthat a horde-of maddened N.E.C. men\nwere about to descend up om the College\nthe \"Carrot\" was therefore sent off\nimmediately to Kew Gardens, - for class-if i cation.

Cup by defeating\n(quite convincingly) Chelsea Poly.\nThey sustained their first defeat against Bridgwater by the narrow margin of\n5-0. This is a very creditable\nresult against such a strong team,\nbearing in mind that I.C. were without some of their key players.\nThe second team were also defeated for the first time last weekend,\nby London Welsh Dragons. This was\nby far their strongest fixture to date,\nhaving been moved up one side from last\nseason. Next season the 1st XV will\nplay the \"Druids\".\nLast Saturday the 'A' XV, a side\nalmost unchanged from that which was\nchosen, were unlucky to lose 6-8 to\na fairly strong London Welsh 'A' XV.\nTwo breaks in the first half gave the\nvisitors an 8-0 lead. The second\nhalf 3aw the extra fitness of the oo lle ge side come into play and the Welsh\nside were hard pressed to hold their\nlead. Taurins kicked two penalties.\nThe lower side3 are enjoying mixed\nsuccesses, but from all accounts they\nare enjoying their Rugby and are now\nentering into the 'Spirit' of the Club.\nIf anybody in the College would\nlike to start playing Rugby, they would\nbe very welcome. Their support is needed to enable us to field all of\nour teams each week, and in return we\no an guarantee the jar very pleasant\nSaturday evenings away from all the\ncares of the world.\nBOAT CLUB MORPHY DAY\nThe Lorry Cup was the first to be\nraced for on Wednesday. With the high\ntide flooding the towpath the crews\npaddled out to Hammersmith Bridge in poor visibility. It was evident right\nfrom the start that the race was between R.C.S. and Guilds; the Miners\nhowever putting up a gallant show.\nR.C.S. quickly went into a lead which\nthey never looked like losing, eventually beating Guilds by one length.\nA fast start was made in the Morphy\nCup race, all three crews rowing well\nfor about a third of the mile when\nR.C.S. crowded Guilds and the race\nhad to be re rowed. A good start was\nagain made, Guilds going into the\nlead and rowing a steady 32 with R.C.S.34. and Mine3 28. Mines were soon out\nof the race but R.C.S. held on a few\nfeet behind Guilds. It seemed to be\nanybody's race until the boat house where\nGuilds showed their power, to finish\na length ahead of R.C.S. This well\nrowed race was one of the closest seen\nand certainly well worth watching.\nNov. 5th1 st XV v Chelsea Poly. won 24-8\nNov. 8th2 nd XV vU.

Nov. 8th I.C. Judo Club\ndrew a closely fought match with Cambridge University. Out of 6 contests,\nJ. Bowles won his, 4 were drawn and one\nlost.\nOn Sat. Nov. 15th I.C. entered a team of 5 in the British Universities\nEliminations far the South Eastern\nTeam. Three of our number fought\ntheir way into the Regional Team;\nthe other, two are reserves. The Captain, John Shepperd, did very well by\nbeating the Cambridge Captain by a powerful Tewaza (Hand Throw), so that he\nnow leads the Regional Team in the\nFinals on 29th Nov. at the Budakwai.\nSWIMMING\nThe swimming section continued\ntheir undefeated run, and enhanced\ntheir oha noes of wining the University\nChampionships again, beating KINGS by\n33 pts. to 17 pts. Individual winners\nfor I.C. were Harford, Loveman and\nShorey, who had good support from\nWilson, Alloook, Jones and Poet. A polo match followed in which I.C. beat KINGS by 5-2. Baa ham 2, Jones,\nLarson, and Shorey, scoring for I.C. Despite their suo ces s in intercollegiate matches, the water polo\nteam has yet to record a win, against\nLondon o lub opposition. Last week's visitors Richmond, defeated I.C. by 8\ngoals to 2. The I.C. team cracking\nin the second half of a very fast game.\nBoth goals far I.C. were scored by\nHart.\nThe next week, opposition was\nprovided by a team of University players,\nwho won a hard fought match by 5 goals\nto 4. Goals for I.C. were scored by\nJones 2, Hart and Shorey.\nThe second team have yet to score\ntheir first victory, but at present,\nalthough a third division team, they\nhave been forced to take on second\ndivision teams. As a result defeat\nis not entirely unexpected; in fact the\nteam ha3 done very well in loosing to\nmore experienced opponents by narrow\nmargins. Last week they l03t62 to\nL.S.E.; Mears scaring both goals for\nI.C. CROSS COUNTRY.\nThe first team travelled to Birmingham on Nov. 8th to take part in the\n\"Midlands Match\", in which the major\nLondon Colleges ran against a number of\nMidland Universities. The result was\nhighly satisfactory from our point of\nview - with I. C.1st Birmingham 2nd and Manchester 3rd, with the other London Colleges well and truly beaten.\nThe team scores were:\n1. I.C.722. Birmingham 83\n3. Manchester 83\n4. Kings (London) 197\n5. U.C.( London) 215\n6. L.S.E.217 The I.C. team must be congratulated for this first-class performance.\nTheir individual positions were:\n4. Collins, 6. Briggs, 8. Larknm, 17\nJaeger, 18. Brown, 19. Cleator (in a field of 66).\nOn the same day the I.C. second and\nthird teams easily defeated Goldsmiths\nCollege, the race being won by D. Hammonds, who was followed in by Warren,\nHuntley, Barker, Auton, James (I.C. taking the first six places). The captain\nappears in a very lowly place in the\nresults of this race, but it should be\nmentioned that he was led astray and\nran a mile too far. (What led him\nastray?!!).\nThe following Wednesday, I.C. defeated Q.M. C. at Petersham by\n32 pts. to 50. The fir3 t six I.C. positions were:\n1. A. Brown and G. Tilly( equal,\n29:55); 4. Bernard; 7. Hammonds;\n8. Warren; 10. Sandoz.\nOn Saturday, Nov. 15th, I.C. defeated U.C., but were beaten by a strong Vale of Aylesbury A.C. team.\nThe I.C. team was, of course, weakened\nby the fact that our 6 best men were\nrunning for U.L. against Oxford.\nThe numerical strength of the Club this\nyear is shown by the fact that we had\n17 men in this race. The first six\nI.C. positions were filled by 4. Tilly,\n7. Bernard, 8. Gilbert, 10. Rayment,\n13. Hammonds, 14. Manson.\nLondon University were narrowly\ndefeated 32-47 by Oxford, but we congratulate John Collins of I.C. who was\nthe first London man home, in4 th place,\nonly 20 sees, behind the winner. Briggs\nfinished 10th and Larkum 13th for the\nU.L.1 st team. In the second team\nmatch Oxford beat London 40-62; the\nthree I.C. representatives, Jaeger,\nCleator and Brown finished 7th,9 th and\n12th respectively.\nWe hope all SPORTSMEN will come\nto the 'PELJJC* HOP.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD Imperial College Union S.W.7, Printed by S 'lL VOUS PLAIT Ltd. 307a, Telephone Plao W.14t "

Winter Relays Competition, .and Tjalve trophy for field\nevents, took place on Wednesday 12th Nov. Conditions were not exactly per-fec t:a persistent drizzle hanging\nover a porridge track, with a mud\nbath in the middle, wh i oh soon had the\nthrowers slipping badly, causing their\nimplements to pursue rather er ratio and dangerous directions.\nIn spite of Nature's aggression,\nperformances were quite good for the\ntime of year and the I.C. relay teams\nexcelled themselves. Our sprint\nrelay (4 x110 yards) team, consisting\nof 3 fresher s, took both the heat and\nfinal with contemptuous ease.\nThe o lub was 4th out of a large\nfield in the long medley relay, but\nthe race of the afternoon was the final\nof the (220 220 440) relay, before\nwhich I.C. was only 1 point behind St.\nMary's College Hospital. Although\non the last leg we had a lead of 15\nyards, the St. Mary's anchor, ii orman Putter U.L. first string, eventually\nclosed the gap to just beat U3 at the\ntape. Thus for the second year I.C. have just been beaten in these relays.\nThe field events were very disappointing for the club with many of\nour best men\"otherwise engaged\".\nSpecial thanks are given to those who\nkeenly turned out at last minute notice.\nConsequently, I.C. were disgracefully\n6th equal: but congratulations are\nexpressed to our long and triple jumpers\nwho saved the position from being even\nworse.\nDespite a University Crosscountry Race the previous day two members( A.

By the time we reached Streatham\nthe rain had begun to penetrate and\nDave Clark left us to return home. +\nflask! But with Mr. Moore at the\nwheel and Brian Wellstead on the throttle we rocketed on, past red traffic\nlights, to the right of \"Keep Left\"\nsigns, and everywhere with complete\npriority. At Thornton Heath Pond\na Volkswagen dithered in front of us\nand we were forced to collide with its rear wing (which crumpled absorbing most\nof the impact). A quick inspection\nrevealed no serious damage to Bo, so\nwe changed drivers and were off again.\nA few more stop3 an inlet valve\ncheck, oil replenishment, and to free\na jammed top gear - sufficed; and a3 the clocks were striking 12 o 'clock\nwe entered Brighton and signed off\nin Madeira Drive.\nThen followed an admirable lunch\nat Clarges Hotel-with 45 members of\nC&G and R.C.S.
