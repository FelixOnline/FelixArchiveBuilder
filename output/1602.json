At this point, you\nhave been told multiple times that\nyou only have x-amount of weeks left,\nand everyone is freaking out about\nhow they haven\u2019t started revising yet.\nHowever, as a gamer my foremost\nthought is how I am going to keep up\nmy gaming habit, while still avoiding\nfailing. Dear reader, if these thoughts\nhave also crossed your mind, do not\nfear, for after 3 years at I feel like I have\namassed enough experience to help you\nachieve at least that 2.2!\nMy first piece of advice is, avoid time\nintensive games like RPGs. It is hard\nto really get into those kind of games\nwithout investing a lot of time into\nthem. Therefore, a quick session to\ncalm your mind down will end up as\na monster session, and the next thing\nyou know you will be doing a Leroy\nJenkins in your exam. Therefore games\nlike, Skyrim, WoW or Dragon Age are a\ndefinite no-go.\nLogic demands that you should play\ngames that allow you to get in, get your\nfix and get back working. These games\ninclude things like Counter strike, FIFA,\nLOL and DOTA. All these games have a\nformat, which has a defined beginning\nMAXIMILIAN EGGL\nGAMES EDITOR\nOn Thursday and Friday of\nlast week the inaugural\nchampionship was held at\nthe UK\u2019s new gaming arena, the\nGfinity Arena in Fulham Broadway.\nThis is the first gaming arena in\nthe country, taking up three of the\nscreens of the Vue cinema located\nin the shopping centre outside of\nFulham Broadway tube station. The\nevent, Hearthstone Spring Masters,\nwhich took up most of the two days,\nwas won by Firebat the current\nworld champion beating Sosuz four\nmatches to one.\nNow I have to admit that I had\nnot played Hearthstone until the\nnight before, having just won a ticket\nfrom a raffle Gfinity was running\nto promote the event, I did not know\nwhat to expect. The regular ticket\nprice was \u00a315 for the main stage for\nthe day or \u00a312.50 for the challenge\nstage, which probably covered some\nof the $7,000 prize pool. Upon\nentering the cinema I could see that\none half of the entrance hall had\nbeen taken over by Gifinity branding\nand the staff directed me to the three\ncordoned off screens that make up\nthe Gfinity arena. I was then given\na wrist band, with access to both\nscreens, so that I could come and go\nover the course of the two days.\nThe main stage was screen 1 and\nconsisted of dimly lit two booths,\nwhich I assume where sound proof, a\ncaster\u2019s (read commentator) box and\na lots of light and sound rigging were\nlocated; the challenge screen, screen\n2, was much the same. The main\nscreen showed one of the competitors\nhand, and would switch depending\non whose turn it was. The event\nwent without any problems, save\nfor one match I watched were they\ncould not get a stream from one of\nthe computers. This event seemed\nto be the cheapest of those for which\ntickets have been released, most\nof the other events costing \u00a317.50\nfor main stage access, going up to\n\u00a350 for VIP seating for the CSGO\n(Counter Strike Global Offensive)\ntournament.\nNow you may not have heard of\nGfinity before, that\u2019s because they\nare an extremely new company that\u2019s\npart of the ever growing e-sports\nseen. They are a UK based and they\norganises online competitions in a\nnumber of different video games,\nsuch as Call of Duty (CoD), CSGO,\nand Fifa. eSports is already very\nwell established in America with\nMLG (Major League Gaming) doing\nmuch the same job as Gfinnity,\nhowever it has been around since\n2002. The upcoming MLG CoD\nchampionships for example have a\nprize pot of $1million. With each\nmember of the winning team in the\nCoD championships walking away\nwith $100,000 in addition to major\nsponsorship deals that a win would\ninevitably yield.\nEarlier last week Gfinity\nannounced that they will be opening\na second Arena soon, probably in\nconjunction with Vue again, however\nthey have not said where it will be.\nThere looks to be a full season of\nevents at the arena this year so if\nyou are interested in eSports, or\njust gaming in general, I would\nrecommend checking it out. One\nthing is for sure the evolving world of\neSports is now serious business and\nwhether you think that it\u2019s a sport or\nnot, it is here stay.\n\"Play\ngames that\nallow you\nto get in,\nget your\nfix and\nget back\nworking.\"\n\"The most\nimportant\naspect is\ndiscipline.\"\nand end, with a usual game time of\nabout an hour. This sets boundaries and\ncuts out any excuses. As long as you can\nit to one game at a time, then these guys\nwill perfectly satisfying your gaming\nneeds while still allowing you to study.\nPart of the appeal of playing these\nshort games, is that they require\nlittle to no thought. Your brain will\nbe exhausted from all that difficult\nrevision, so why play something that\nrequires you to solve puzzles and/or\nactually have to think about? These\nthings are supposed to let you relax,\nwithout having to mundane things like\nwatching television.\nAlso, have set times when you play\nyour games, and make sure you stick to\nour routine. The more you vary around\nthe times, the less disciplined you will\nbe when it comes to stopping. I find, a\ncheeky CSGO match after dinner from\n6-7, wakes me up enough to continue\nstudying afterwards.\nHowever, the most important\naspect is discipline. Once you get that\ndopamine flowing in your veins, it\nis indeed hard to stop. Yet, you must\nbe strong and fight the temptation\nthat strikes you. While of course\ngaming is very important (if not the\nmost important), we have spent a\nconsiderable amount on our education.\nDon\u2019t waste it!\nAnyway guys, have fun, dominate\nthose games and good luck!\nDefintely the right attitude!!

Willows and biofuels\nThe true scale of climate change\nand its impacts on our planet\nhas escalated in the last 50\nyears. Scientific advancement has\nbeen at the forefront in efforts to\nachieve a more stable climatic future.\nBiofuel development symbolises a\nsignificant movement towards this\nfuture. However, growing evidence\nindicates that this supposedly\nsustainable, green solution is not quite\nas great as people hoped.\nEssentially biofuels have a \u201csolution\nto climate change\u201d prestige; but in\nreality act as poor alternatives to\nfossil fuel use, diverting attention\nfrom what real action needs to be\nundertaken. The core issue is the\nchange in land use required for biofuel\nproduction. Monoculture expanses\nremove essential biodiversity from an\narea and use damaging petrochemical\nfertilisers and pesticides. This has\nresulted in food price elevation,\nadditional greenhouse gas emissions\nas well as the removal of land from\nsmall local farmers.\nBut lets not be too pessimistic.\nStudies have looked at the different\nbiofuel forms, from corn, sugarcane,\nto woody coppice and accessed the\nfuels sustainability in terms of\nthe fuels environmental impacts,\ndirect and indirect greenhouse gas\nemissions. The scenario is very much\napple and oranges; different biofuels\nhave their own pros and cons. The\nwillow tree has been the subject of\nmuch research into biofuels as it\nstands out by vastly reducing the\ndegree of land-use change, being able\nto tolerate adverse environmental\nconditions, such as poor infertile soils\nand windy slopes. Thus the Willow\ncan be cultivated in infertile areas\nreducing deforestation pressures.\nNovel scientific evidence indicates\nthat willow trees growing at an angle\nof 45 degrees produce up to five times\nmore starch-rich gelatinous fibre \u2013\nincreasing biofuel yields. This stressor\nresponse enables the trees to stay\nupright when tilted at such an angle.\nThis could reduce the amount of\nland required for biofuel production.\nHowever, it is still unknown exactly\nhow this happens.\nResearchers at the Natural History\nMuseum, University of Surrey and\nRothamsted Research Centre used\nhigh resolution 3D imaging via x-ray\nmicro-computer tomography (CT\nscanning ) to see microscale changes to\nbe observed, these cause a macroscale\nresponse. Findings indicated\nthat tilting induced stress, which\nprolonged the life of cells involved\nin the production of starch rich\ngelatinous fibre. The next step would\nbe to use an even higher resolution\nCT scanner and see which willow\ntree species produce the most of this\nstarchy fibre. Specific selection of\nsuch species will increase further the\nproductivity of willow biomass biofuel\nharvesting.\nThe willow tree represents just\none alternative biomass source for\nbiofuel production. There are many\nothers including fuels derived from\nmanure, and recycled oil. Therefore,\ninvestment targeted towards more\nunsustainable biofuel forms should\nchange. Studies such as those shown\nby the willow tree represent a single\nsmall-scale advancement to achieve\na more energy sustainable future and\nreduce climate change impacts. Never\nthe less, these small-scale changes\nshould not be disregarded in there\nimportance. They represent progress\nin the right direction. They are\nimportant stepping stones to achieve\nthe future vision, that is globalisation\nof clean energy.\nDOI: doi:10.1186/s12870-015-0438-0\nJane Courtnell reports on research into alternative energy sources\nWarm oceans found on Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus\nCECILY JOHNSON\nSCIENCE WRITER\nMicroscopic grains of silicon-rich rock detected by\nNASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft\nhave provided the first clear evidence\nof hydrothermal activity occurring\noutside our planet. A four-year\nanalysis of data from Cassini\u2019s\ninstruments, alongside laboratory\nexperiments and computer\nmodelling, was published in Nature\nthis week by scientists at the\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder.\nThe Cosmic Dust Analyser (CDA)\ninstrument has been detecting\ntiny rock particles for a number\nof years, as Cassini orbits Saturn\nand its moons. Data from the mass\nspectrometer showed that they are\nprimarily composed of silica, which is\ncommonly found on Earth as quartz\nor sand. The size of the particles,\nwhich range from 2 to 9 nanometres\nin radius suggested that they were\ncreated by a specific process.\nA very specific range of conditions\nis required for particles of this type\nto form on Earth. Silica particles are\ncreated when water with less than 4%\nsalinity, high levels of silica and a pH\nbetween 8.5 and 10 undergo a large\ntemperature drop from an initial\nhigh of around 90\u00b0C. The researchers\nbelieve that this process is also\noccurring on the floor of Enceladus\u2019\noceans, where hot water at the rocky\ncore of the moon comes into contact\nwith cooler waters above.\nThe seawater permeates and\ninteracts chemically with the crust\nof porous rock at the ocean bottom,\nforming new minerals. The solution\nthen travels through a region of\ncolder water before being carried\nup to the surface, where the silica is\nexpelled in Enceladus\u2019 ice geysers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting that we can use\nthese tiny grains of rock, spewed\ninto space by geysers, to tell us about\nconditions on \u2013 and beneath \u2013 the\nocean floor of an icy moon,\u201d said\nthe paper\u2019s lead author Sean Hsu, a\nResearch Associate at CU-Boulder\u2019s\nLaboratory for Atmospheric and\nSpace Physics (LASP).\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known from quite\nearly on that Enceladus was the\nsource of the material in Saturn\u2019s\n[outermost] ring\u2026 based on the\nring\u2019s composition, although we\ndidn\u2019t know the exact mechanism\nfor the material transfer\u201d. Ongoing\ngeological activity on Enceladus,\nwhich is Saturn\u2019s sixth-largest moon,\nwas first detected by Cassini in 2005.\nGeysers 125 miles tall spray water ice\nand vapour, salts and other organic\nmaterials into space from warm\ncracks on the moon\u2019s surface.\nThe 6 mile deep ocean that is\nnow understood to generate these\nparticles is also believed to contain a\nvariety of chemicals associated with\nthe development of Earth-like life,\nincluding carbon dioxide, nitrogen\nand methane. This latest study adds\nto the tantalising body of evidence\nindicating that environments which\ncan support living organisms could\npossibly be found on one of Saturn\u2019s\nmoons.\n\u201cThese findings add to the\npossibility that Enceladus, which\ncontains a subsurface ocean and\ndisplays remarkable geologic\nactivity, could contain environments\nsuitable for living organisms,\u201d said\nastronaut John Grunsfeld, associate\nadministrator of NASA\u2019s Science\nMission Directorate in Washington.\n\u201cThe locations in our solar system\nwhere extreme environments occur\nin which life might exist may bring us\ncloser to answering the question: are\nwe alone in the Universe\u201d.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature14262 The new findings make Enceladus a potential home of life Photo: NASA\nCT scan of willow showing fibre (brown) and vessels (blue) Photo: BMC\nPlant Biology\n\n"

The evening\nwas meant to pay homage to the\nincredible progression of women\u2019s\nsport and in fact women at Imperial\nin general, but in reality, due to the\nthoughtlessness of the staff of Sport\nImperial, it fell flat on its face.\nBefore the women rugby players\nhad even reached the stadium, the\ncoach that was organised to take\nthem there failed to materialise.\nThen, during the match, coaches were\nallowed to leave during the girl\u2019s final\nmatch, despite the team stressing that\nunder no circumstances should they\nbe left to play to an empty stadium.\nThe team were rushed through\ntheir cold after-match dinner, after\nthe men\u2019s team had had their fill and\nalready left. Finally, those that were\nable clambered onto a coach full of\nagitated spectators that had been\nmade to sit there for 40 minutes,\nwhilst other players were left behind.\nTo top it all off, those who were\nleft behind were also apparently\nverbally abused by a staff member,\nwho proceeded to make misogynistic\nremarks about the girl\u2019s appearances.\nAlthough Sport Imperial state that\nthe transportation nightmare was\nnot their fault, the fact that the whole\nthing wasn\u2019t organised meticulously\nmonths beforehand still raises\nconcerns. As far as I\u2019m aware, Varsity\nhas been a pretty streamlined affair;\ntransport issues have always cropped\nup but surely over time these should\nhave been ironed out.\nThe fact that Sport Imperial\nhaven\u2019t outright apologised for any\nof these events is testament to the\nfact that no-one ever wants to appear\naccountable at Imperial; no-one ever\nhold up their hands and admits they\nfucked up.\nIf Sport Imperial organise an event,\nthen it should run as they please,\nand they shouldn\u2019t blame coach\ncompanies or stadium staff that they\nare paying and therefore can instruct\nand direct as necessary. It certainly\nisn\u2019t unreasonable to direct catering\nto serve hot food at a time you would\nlike, and it also isn\u2019t unreasonable to\ninstruct coaches to leave and arrive\nwhen you choose.\nNot only that, the fact that extra\ncare and attention wasn\u2019t taken to\nensure this essential milestone for\nwomen\u2019s sport went off without a\nhitch is testament to the underlying\nattitude the institution has towards\nthe women\u2019s teams in general; that\nit obviously doesn\u2019t deserve such\nfocus in the first place. It stinks\nof incompetence, laziness, and a\ndisregard for how important this\nevent should have been.\nThat\u2019s before we even begin\nto tackle the downright sexism\ndisplayed by the staff member who\nstated brazenly that he didn\u2019t care\n\u201chow the fat girls get home\u201d after\nhearing students were stranded.\nWomen@Imperial week came to\na close last week, and it was a flurry\nof positive tweeting, bright and\ncolourful photos, hashtags, long and\nbuzzword-filled speeches, and totally\ndevoid of any of the grim reality that\nwomen face at Imperial day in and\nday out.\nNo-one considered using the week\nto address the damage that misogyny\ncan have on a community, and the\nnegative effects things that some\npeople aren\u2019t even they are aware they\nare doing can have.\nI would like to think that this staff\nmember, who interacts with students\nof all genders day in day out, doesn\u2019t\nactually consider himself a sexist pig.\nHowever, comments on a women\u2019s\nappearance made in a derogatory\nmanner and with a vile attitude to\nboot is a key example of the sort of\nmisogyny that goes unchecked day in\nand day out.\nMaybe if Imperial had not played it\nsafe with Women@Imperial, and not\nsuggested we are already there as an\ninstitution when it comes to female\nequality, such comments would not\ncontinue to happen in the future.\nWe need to fully challenge the\npoor attitudes to women at Imperial\nand explain how misogyny can\nresonate in many ways; from an\nangry comment over a walkie-talkie\nto a lack of disregard when it comes\nto organising the next big platform\nfor women\u2019s sport, all contribute to\nthe inequality women face day in and\nday out.\nAnd to be quite frank, it pisses me\noff.\nTHIS WEEK\u2019S EDITORIAL\nSport Imperial have\ndropped the ball\nContents\nNews\b 3\u20138\nFeatures\b 9\u201310\nComment\b11\nScience\b 12\u201314\nPolitics\b 15\u201317\nMusic\b 18\nTelevision\b 19\nFilm\b 20\nPHOENIX PULLOUT\nWelfare\b 27\nGames\b 28\nArts\b 29\u201336\nTravel\b 37\nFashion\b 38\u201339\nHangman\b 40\u201342\nPuzzles\b 43\u201344\nSport\b 45\u201348\nWhat\u2019s on this\nweek\nIMPERIAL\u2019S FIRST\nDANCE SHOW\nMARCH 26\u201327TH, 19:00\nUNION CONCERT HALL\nIt\u2019ll be well awesome,so go!

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 15\nFELIX 20.03.2015\nPolitics Politics Editor Joshua Renken\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Scottish National Party:\nwhat you need to know\nYou\u2019ve probably heard by now that\nthe upcoming General Election is\nthe most unpredictable and arguably\none of the most important in recent\nUK political history. Minor parties\nare winning a large number of\nvotes, diminishing the chances of an\noutright single-party majority in the\nprocess.\nIt is therefore very likely that\nsome kind of coalition or minority\nadministration will have to be\nformed. Failing that, there could even\nbe a second general election later on\nin 2015 if any three party \u201crainbow\u201d\nalliances fall through, but this is very\nunlikely.\nThe coalition negotiations that\nare expected to take place after the\npublic vote on 7th\nof May will have\nfar reaching consequences for all of\nour lives, at which point only the\ntop politicians will determine the\nconsequences of the mandate from\nthe people. If cross party talks do have\nto occur, it will be messy and possibly\nquite cheerless, because every party\nwill have lost the election and nobody\nwill get the government they want.\nSo what has this got to do with the\nSNP? Well, the Scottish National\nParty has been steadily gaining in\nthe polls in Scotland, to the point\nwhere they are expected to win\nalmost every seat north of the border.\nThis is a disaster for Labour, who in\n2010 won 40 of the 59 Scottish seats,\nbut this time round are looking at\nonly winning a small handful of\nconstituencies, if any.\nThe SNP first got into power in\n2007 as a minority government, but\nin 2011 they increased their support\nto become a majority government\n(64/129 MSPs), the first ever seen\nat Holyrood. The SNP has the third\nlargest party membership in the\nUK (93,000) and now commands\nstrong majorities in many Scottish\nconstituencies.\nSo many in fact that the SNP are\nexpected to see their representation\nin Westminster increase from six\nseats in 2010 to more than 50 in 2015.\nA party that can only be voted for\nby less than a tenth of the United\nKingdom\u2019s population is going to\nhave the third highest number of\nseats in the House of Commons come\nMay, and could be the kingmakers in\ncoalition talks.\nIn 2010 the Lib Dems had enough\nseats to create a shared majority\ngovernment with the Conservatives,\nbut this will not be the case in 2015.\nNick Clegg\u2019s party will see their\nparliamentary representation half,\nwhile the Scottish nationalists\npractically clear up north of the\nborder to win a similar number of\nMPs that the Lib Dems currently\nhave. The First Minister of Scotland\nand Leader of the SNP Nicola\nSturgeon will be hugely influential in\nthe subsequent negotiations that will\ntake place after a hung parliament is\ncalled.\nLabour and the SNP combined\ncould possibly win enough seats\nfor a slim majority in the House\nof Commons, but politicians on\nboth sides have always said there is\nvirtually no prospect of a coalition,\nmainly because it would not further\nthe interests of either party.\nSturgeon explained that although\nshe couldn\u2019t imagine a coalition\nbetween the two centre-left parties,\nshe could envision a Labour minority\ngovernment that deals with the\nSNP on a vote-by-vote basis to get\nthings passed through the House of\nCommons.\nThis \u2018confidence and supply\u2019\nalternative would allow Labour to\npass vital actions such as the budget\nwithout having to concede ministerial\nposts to the Scottish nationalists.\nA few days ago Ed Miliband\nofficially ruled out the possibility\nof a formal coalition agreement\nbetween the two parties, saying \u201cthere\nwill be no SNP ministers in any\ngovernment I lead.\u201d This will also put\na stop to Conservative ads showing\nEd Miliband in the pocket of Alex\nSalmond, the former Leader of the\nSNP.\nLeader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon is about to become very important in UK politics. Photo: Jeff J Mitchell via Getty Images\nJoshua Renken gives a brief overview of what you need to know\nabout the SNP before heading to the polling station this May\nA Labour-SNP-Lib Dem three\nparty coalition would be almost\nguaranteed to get the seats required\nfor a majority government, but Vince\nCable has called a Lib Dem-SNP deal\n\u2018inconceivable.\u2019 A Conservative-SNP\npost-election deal is even less feasible.\nThe SNP was founded in 1934\nduring the merger of the National\nParty of Scotland and the Scottish\nParty. They have gained support in\nScotland over the last few decades\nand finally came to power on a wave\nof anti-establishment, anti-austerity\npolitics.\nOne of the most talked about, and\npotentially problematic, demands\nof the Scottish Nationals is for\nthe unilateral disarmament of the\nUK\u2019s nuclear weapons programme,\nTrident. More generally though,\nas a socially democratic centre-left party the SNP want more\nprogressive personal taxation, free\nhigher education, an increase in the\nminimum wage, heavily reduced cuts\nto public services, voting from the\nage of 16 and, most notably, Scottish\nindependence. At the very least in\nthis parliament the SNP might accept\nfurther devolution of powers to\nHolyrood, as is currently going on.\nSNP Leader and First Minister of\nScotland Nicola Sturgeon took the\nhelm as Alex Salmond\u2019s successor\nafter his swift resignation following\ndefeat in the Scottish independence\nreferendum, when Scots voted to stay\nin the UK 55:45. Sturgeon has said in\ninterviews that she will not rule out\nthe possibility of holding another\nreferendum for the break up of the\nUK, the prospects for which look less\nattractive for Scotland than they did\nlast September due to the recent drop\nin oil prices. Scotland\u2019s success as an\nindependent country is closely tied to\nhow much revenue could be created\nfrom their oil reserves \u2013 the amount\nof which is not precisely known, and\nthis fall in prices would spell disaster\nfor government expenditure plans.\nThe take home message here is that\nif Labour is the biggest loser after\nthe election, a minority government\nbacked by the SNP is looking far more\nplausible than an actual coalition.\nScottish nationalists are going to be\na powerful and controversial force in\nWestminster and will complicate the\nalready difficult situation further.\nWe have had minority governments\nbefore, but the next administration is\nset to be one of the least stable in our\nhistory.\nYour vote on 7th\nof May really\nmatters; please do not waste the\nopportunity to voice your opinion\nat the ballot box. Uncertain yet\ninteresting times are ahead in British\npolitics. Good news for journalists,\nbad news for the rest of us.\n\n"

From historical\ndrama to sci-fi thriller, musical to\nsurreal comedy, we\u2019ve got it all lined\nup and ready to go.\nSelma - 18:00\nFirst up comes Selma, the biopic of\nMartin Luther King, Jr. that focuses\non much more than just the great\nman himself. This is the story of\nevents in Selma, Montgomery in\n1965, the scene of one of the most\nfamous marches for civil rights in\nhistory.\nThe peaceful marchers are met with\nbrutal resistance, but they persevere,\nwith their bravery a continued source\nof inspiration.\nThe film picked up an Oscar\nfor Best Original Song, but the\nperformances (and direction) are\namong the strongest of the past year\u2019s\ncrop of films.\nEx Machina - 21:00\nOur second film is Alex Garland\u2019s\ndirectorial debut, and it\u2019s an absolute\nstunner of a first effort.\nDealing with themes of artificial\nintelligence, consciousness, and\nfree will, Ex Machina tells the tale of\nCaleb, a software engineer who wins a\ncompetition to spend a week with his\nrecluse boss, the technological genius\nNathan.\nWhen Caleb arrives at Nathan\u2019s\nretreat, he discovers the real\npurpose of the competition: to find\na participant for a Turing Test with\nNathan\u2019s pet project, an AI called Ava.\nAs the test starts, it appears that\nAva isn\u2019t quite what she seems, and\nmaybe Nathan isn\u2019t either\u2026\nWhiplash - 23:45\nThe third entry in this term\u2019s AllNighter is the critical darling story\nof Miles Teller\u2019s young drummer,\nwho joins a studio band led by J.\nK. Simmons\u2019 brutally dictatorial\nconductor.\nHolding three Oscars (including\none for Best Supporting Actor for\nSimmons), this is our most-garlanded\nfilm on offer, and it\u2019s an intense\nexperience that doesn\u2019t let up until\nthe final drumbeat.\nInto the Woods - 01:45\nRelieving the intensity with a\nmusical, you say? Almost, but not\nquite.\nThe film adaptation of Sondheim\u2019s\nInto the Woods sees the composer\nextraordinaire turn his hands to fairy\ntales, serving up a deliciously twisted\nversion of your childhood stories.\nHappy ever after isn\u2019t so far away,\nbut what comes next is where the fun\ntruly begins.\nWith an all-star, all singing, all\ndancing cast, and Rob Marshall\n(who directed the Oscar-winning\nadapatation of Chicago) at the helm,\nInto the Woods is a musical treat.\nPaddington - 04:05\nAn entirely different style of big-screen adaptation comes in this, the\nsilver screen re-telling of Michael\nBond\u2019s children\u2019s books.\nMany years ago, a British explorer\nin Peru comes across a family of\nbears, who he rapidly develops a\nbond with, teaching them the ways of\ncivilisation.\nYears later, after a horrible tragedy,\na young bear makes the treacherous\njourney to London, seeking a new\nhome. But London is not as friendly\nas he had been told \u2013 at least, not\nuntil he meets the Brown family.\nThe most heart-warming,\nadorable film of the year marks the\npenultimate step in our All-Nighter,\nbefore:\n\"Right up\nuntil the\npart where\nthey\u2019re all\nimmortal\nvampires.\"\nPhoto: Universal/Alex Garland\nPhoto: Sony/Damien Chazelle\nPhoto: Pathe/Ava DuVernay\nWhat We Do in the Shadows\n-06:00\nThis kooky comedy deals with the\nlives of three flatmates, who have to\ndeal with all of life\u2019s usual struggles:\nrent, chores, social lives, the squabbles\nprovoked by living together.\nAll in all, fairly standard, right up\nto the part where they\u2019re all immortal\nvampires. What We Do in the Shadows\nplays with the tropes of vampire\nfilms as well as slice-of-life comedies,\nproviding one of the most side-splittingly funny films in years that\nhides an emotional (if slightly weird)\nheart.\nTickets On Sale Now!\nAll six films are being shown back-to-back on the night of Tuesday 24th\nMarch at Imperial Cinema.\nTickets are \u00a310 online (or \u00a312\non the door), and can be purchased\nonline via imperialcinema.co.uk (with\nmore information on the line-up also\navailable on the website).\nTickets can also be purchased on the\ndoor for individual films, at just \u00a33\nfor each film.\nThere\u2019s also the opportunity to\npurchase an all-you-can-eat food\nvoucher for just \u00a35, to keep you\nfuelled up and raring to consume\nquality films throughout the night!\nPhoto: Disney/Rob Marshall\nPhoto: Studiocanal/Paul King\nPhoto: Metrodome/Jermaine\nClement & Taika Waititi\n\n"

Mark Douet\n2015\nClara Clark Nevola checks out the ROH\u2019s classic opera\n\"Many\naspects of\nthe piece\nwere left\nunexplored,\nsuch as the\nelement of\nsexuality\"\nMozart\u2019s Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\n\u2013 The Magic Flute \u2013 is\nback at the Royal Opera\nHouse in the 12th\nyear of David\nMcVicar\u2019s production. One of the\nmost frequently performed operas,\nDie Zauberfl\u00f6te has a highly unusual\nformat, with the sung components\ninterspersed with lots of dialogue,\nmaking it a piece that requires great\ntheatrical skill as well as world class\nopera singers. Its storyline weaves\nin and out of folk-tale, legend, and\ncult, switching from enchantments to\nallusions to the Freemasons. Beneath\nall these nuances, Die Zauberfl\u00f6te is\na boy-meets-girl tale: noble Tamino\ngoes on a quest to find and free\nthe beautiful Pamina, helped by\nhis comic side-kick Papageno. He\novercomes the hurdles, defeats the\nbaddies, and even Papageno gets a girl\n\u2013 everyone is happy.\nThe noble couple are excellent:\nbeautiful, pure, and uncomplicated,\nas all one-dimensional heroes should\nbe. In particular, Janai Brugger is\nheart-breaking as Pamina, adorable\nas a fragile princess, with long flowing\nlocks, a frilly white nighty, and a\nvoice like silver. Papageno (Markus\nWerba) also stands out as the only\ncast member who carried his spoken\nlines with outstanding theatrical\nprowess, coming across as a truly\nrelatable and comic man of the\npeople. Counterbalancing the more\nponderous characters, Papageno truly\nmade the show \u2013 though one can\u2019t but\nthink he didn\u2019t get what he deserved\nin Rhian Lois\u2019 shrill \u2018Papagena\u2019.\nThe Disney-ish plot is complicated\nby the shifting allegiances that the\nhero (and the audience) has, as the\nbaddies and goodies switch in front\nof us. Pamina\u2019s mother, the opulent\nQueen of the Night, who sends\nTamino to find her daughter, initially\nappears to be the fairy godmother\nof the situation. She\u2019s got sparkly\nclothes, magic gifts, and needs our\nnoble hero to defeat her enemies\nfor her. Her antagonist, Sarastro,\ncaptured Pamina, has a creepy rape-y\nservant, Monostatos, and comes off\nas the evil magician of the situation.\nYet, as Tamino\u2019s understanding of\nthe situation changes, he realises that\nSarastro is an enlightened, wise and\nreasonable ruler. The staging changes\nfrom a deep blue, star-studded\nbackdrop with a glaring white\nmoon to a warm orange disk \u2013 our\ntransition from the darkness of night\nand religious superstition into the\nlight of reason.\nThe production highlights the\nfeeling of a disoriented journey,\nwith constantly changing staging,\nunexplained symbolism, darkness,\nand fog. However, many aspects\nof the piece were left unexplored,\nsuch as the element of sexuality\nand its repression; the Queen of the\nNight\u2019s ladies in waiting, haughty\nand mysterious, descend into a brawl\nover who should privately guard\nTamino while the others fetch their\nmistress. Their frankness about their\ndesires, echoed in Papageno\u2019s crass\ncomments, contrasts with the Wise\nMen\u2019s insistence on the importance\nof repressing Tamino\u2019s desires and\ntheir instructions on resisting the\ntemptation of women.\nA living testimony to the\nEnlightenment era, Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\nembodies a struggle for wisdom and\ntruth with which we feel comfortable.\nBut the 18th\ncentury was also racist\nand misogynist, and these facts\njar with a modern audience that\nflocks to the opera to have their soul\nelevated. Monostatos may have been\ncast as a white deformed monster,\nrather than the \u201cevil moor\u201d he is\nscripted as, but nothing can ease\nthe blow of lines such as \u201cA woman\ndoes little, gossips much\u201d, \u201cAway\nwith the women, to Hell\u201d. They\nare dropped in, unchallenged, and\nundealt with, murmured without\ncomment as if in the hope of passing\nthem off as outdated and vaguely\ncomic. The conflict between reason\nand superstition, logical man and\nhysterical women, is an interesting\none, which has been ignored by this\nproduction for fear of jarring with\nthe audience. Die Zauberfl\u00f6te doesn\u2019t\nneed to be sanitised, it needs to be\nproduced as the glorious, messy and\ncontroversial opera that it actually is.\nDie Zauberfl\u00f6te was on at the Royal\nOpera House from 23rd\nFebruary - 11th\nMarch. It will be broadcast on BBC\nRadio 3 at 19:30 on 13th\nApril.\n\"Janai\nBrugger\nis heartbreaking\nas Pamina,\nwith a\nvoice like\nsilver\"\nEditorial: The\nPhoenix Issue\nFRED FYLES &\nKAMIL MCCLELLAND\nSECTION EDITORS\nHereitis,thelastissueofterm\nandalongsidethisweek\u2019ssection\nwehaveproducedThePhoenix,\nacelebrationofImperial\u2019sbest\nstudentart.Ithascertainlybeen\nalabouroflovebut,bypairing\ntogetherthedifferentartisticmedia\namixtureofvisualart,photography,\npoetryandshortstories,wehave\ntriedtopresenttheminawaythat\nhighlightstheirquality.\nButmovingontoFelix,westartof\nwithClaraClarkNevola\u2019sreviewof\nDieZauberfl\u00f6te or TheMagicFlute,\na classic opera here performed\non the stage of the RoyalOpera\nHouse.One of the difficulties in\nproducing such an oft-performed\nopera is that you must invigorate\nit with a unique energy that\nbrings something new to the\ninterpretation of the story.\nHowever here,Clara finds this\nwas not done effectively and the\ncomplexity of some of the themes\ncovered was left by the wayside.\nFred Fyles also pays a visit to\nthe Royal Opera House,once\nagain to review a classic of the\nstage,this time the ballet,Swan\nLake.

The condition is\nassociated with an increased risk of\nstillborn birth, neonatal death and\nneurological and cardiovascular\ndisorders later in life. When\ndiagnosed, doctors sometimes decide\nto deliver these babies early, before\nthe lack of oxygen and increased\nacidity becomes too damaging.\nHowever, this can be a tricky decision\nto make and involves balancing\nthe risks of keeping the baby in\na poor womb environment with\nthe increased risk of morta that\u2019s\nassociated with premature births.\nCurrently, there is no consensus\nfor when to trigger the delivery\nin mothers of babies with foetal\ngrowth restriction and no best\nform of monitoring to inform this\ndecision. The Trial of Randomised\nUmbilical and Foetal Flow in Europe\n(TRUFFLE) aimed to help clarify this\ndecision by investigating which of\nthe current monitoring methods are\nmost effective in reducing pre and\npost-natal problems associated with\nfoetal growth restriction.\nWomen at 26-32 weeks into\npregnancy who had been diagnosed\nwith foetal growth restriction were\nrandomly allocated to one of three\ndifferent monitoring methods\ncurrently used in obstetrics. either:\nCardiotocography - this is the\nmost commonly used method of\nfoetal surveillance and monitors the\nvariation in the foetal heart rate.\nEarly ductus venosus changes\n- this uses ultrasound to monitor\nthe resistance in blood flow within\nthe ductus venosus, a small vessel\nbelow the fetus\u2019 heart, and gives an\nindication of oxygen shortage.\nLate ductus venosus changes - this\nalso uses ultrasound to monitor\nvariability in the waveform of the\nblood flow in the ductus venosus and\nindicates abnormalities in the foetus\u2019\nheart contractions.\nThe decision on when to deliver\nthe baby was based on the output of\nthe monitoring technique allocated.\nThey then recorded the rate of\nsurvival both before and after birth\nand followed the surviving babies\nfor two years after to determine\nhow many developed neurological\ndisorders such as cerebral palsy or\nneurosensory impairment. They also\ncarried out a cognitive assessment\nwith a standardised scale of infant\ndevelopment known as the Bayley\nIII score, with a score of less than\n85 suggestive of problems with\nneurodevelopment.\nLead author Christoph Lees, from\nthe Department of Surgery and\nCancer at Imperial College London,\ncommented about the study, \u201cIt is the\nfirst prospective randomised study\nto compare different monitoring\nand management strategies in fetal\ngrowth restriction. Fetal growth\nrestriction is a major problem in\nperinatal medicine and also a major\ncause of neonatal morbidity with\nbabies spending many weeks or\nmonths on neonatal units\u201d.\nThe findings of the study, carried\nout across 20 European specialist\ncentres, indicated that the late\nductus venosus changes monitoring\ntechnique was three times more\neffective in reducing the chances\nof neurodevelopmental problems\ntwo years after birth. Of all babies\nLauren Ratcliffe reports on a trail revealing the most\neffective pre-natal monitoring technique\nthat survived 95% of those that were\ndelivered based on the late ductus\nvenosus changes did not encounter\nneurodevelopmental problems.\nWhereas 85% of babies delivered\naccording to cardiotocography did\nand 91% of those monitored on the\nbasis of early ductus venosus changes.\nHowever, there were no significant\ndifferences in neonatal survival rates\nbetween the different monitoring\ntechniques.\n\u201cIt was a complex monitoring\nprotocol, which is difficult to put\ninto action throughout centres\nin many different countries. But\nwhat was good is that so many\ncentres embraced the study so\nenthusiastically. Also, the study was\nlargely non-funded, which is difficult\nto do in today\u2019s environment,\u201d said\nDr Lees, when I asked about any\nchallenges him and his team had\nfaced.\nThere are current no effective\ntreatments for pregnant women\ndiagnosed with fetal growth\nrestriction. \u201cWe are working on\npotential pharmaco-therapies that\ninvolve vasodilation and improving\nplacental circulation,\u201d Dr Lees\nelucidates. However, what was clear\nfrom the study is that the outlook in\nearly onset growth restriction is much\nbetter than previously imagined,\nwhatever monitoring strategy is\nfollowed\n\u201cThis type of research isn\u2019t a quick\nfix and requires years of hard work.\nThe idea started off in a bar in a hotel\nin Turin with professors Gerry Visser\nand Tullia Todros in 2001 and rapidly\nbecame an international group effort.\nI have co-ordinated all the meetingsit\u2019s been hard work but great fun and\nI am enormously indebted to my\ncollaborators many of whom have\nbecome very good friends. And of\ncourse to the women who took part:\nwe have at least in part with their help\nat a very sensitive time answered a\nquestion that many thought we could\nnever answer,\u201d Dr Lees explains.\nThe researchers are planning\non the \u2018TRUFFLE 2\u2019 study on\nwomen diagnosed with foetal\ngrowth restriction at a later time\nin pregnancy (32 to 36 weeds). Dr\nLees will also be writing a textbook\non foetal growth restriction with\nthe TRUFFLE authors. The trial\nwas published in The Lancet the\n5th\nMarch.

Today, many of\nthe most important and difficult\ndecisions faced by politicians are\nfundamentally scientific, from\nthe best way to tackle climate\nchange to the recent vote to allow\nmitochondrial replacement therapy.\nRobert Winston, Professor of\nScience and Society at Imperial, has\nhad a key role in many of the biggest\nscience policy decisions made by\nparliament in the 20 years he\u2019s been\na Member of the House of Lords. He\nwas voted \u201cPeer of the Year\u201d by his\nfellow parliamentarians in 2008 for\nhis work on the Human Fertilisation\nand Embryology bill. He recently\nspoke to Felix about the role of\nscientists in politics.\n\u201cThe trouble with the House of\nCommons\u201d says Winston, \u201cis that\nmore and more people are going in\nimmediately after leaving University\nwith the idea that they\u2019re going to\nbe party leader in 10 years time,\nand they come in without any\nbackground. If you look at the party\nleaders, all three of them have had\nvery little experience of the real\nworld. Nick Clegg has had some\nslight experience, but the other\ntwo haven\u2019t ever done a proper job,\nreally, it\u2019s always been political,\nand I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for\nparliament. There are a few doctors\nin parliament\u2014Sarah Woolaston, for\nexample, is a very good doctor\u2014but\nwe could do with more.\u201d\nThe number of MPs with a\nscientific background is truly dire.\nOf the 649 MPs, only one has been a\npracticing scientist: Julian Huppert,\na biochemist and MP for Cambridge.\nJust two others have science PhDs,\nand of the 90% with university\ndegrees, only 54 hold theirs in\nany type of science, technology or\nmedicine. This compares to 84 MPs\nwho are former lawyers.\nThe House of Lords, however,\nremains one of the only legislative\nbodies in the world where a huge\namount of scientific expertise can\nbe found. Despite the perennial\nattacks on the chamber as being\nundemocratic and anachronistic, and\nrepeated failed attempts to replace it\nwith an elected body, Lord Winston\nwas keen to defend the valuable role,\nparticularly in scientific matters,\nthat its members can play.\n\u201cThe House of Lords is full of\nscientists, and if you look round the\nHouse, there are a large number of\nus who are Fellows of at least two out\nof the three scientific academies,\na surprising number, who are\nFellows of the Royal Academy of\nEngineering, Fellows of the Royal\nSociety, Fellows of the Academy of\nMedical Sciences, and often many\nof us are Fellows of more than one\nof those institutions. That\u2019s why\ndebates on science in the House of\nLords are well thought of, and are\nmodels for other parliaments to\nfollow.\n\u201cIn the Commons, MPs can\u2019t use\ntheir expertise, as the way parliament\nis structured means that can\u2019t really\nvote with any scientific expertise you\nmight have as you have to vote with\nyour side. In the House of Lords, we\ndon\u2019t take any notice of the whips and\nthey accept that and appreciate that.\u201d]\n\u201cIn the House of Lords, there\u2019s\na feeling that you\u2019re going to vote\nrationally, and I think that\u2019s why the\nchamber should not be too rapidly\nreassembled, as it has some strengths\nwhich are quite important.\u201d\nWinston is proud of the\ncontribution he and other prominent\nscientists have made in the Lords. He\nis Vice-chair of the Parliamentary\nOffice for Science and Technology\nand has advised ministers on science\nand medical policy.\n\u201cI think most people feel that I\ncertainly helped Tony Blair to come\nto the decision to increase funding for\nthe health service very dramatically\nin 2000, and I\u2019m not alone in that.\nAra Darzi (Professor of surgery at\nImperial) has been a tremendously\ninfluential member of the House\nof Lords. He became a minister for\nwhile and really fundamentally laid\ndown some very important things,\nso I think individual members of\nthe House of Lords can have colossal\ninfluence in doing something that\nis really using their expertise. Of\ncourse, you\u2019d never get someone like\nAra Darzi in the lower chamber.\u201d\n\u201cRon Oxburgh as well, one of\nour former Rectors, has been\ntremendously influential in energy\npolicy and renewables and how we\nshould use fossil fuels.\u201d\nMany of the decisions Robert\nWinston has made in politics have\nbeen influenced by his experiences\ntreating patients. How does he\nreconcile this with the need to remain\nobjective and open-minded when\nmaking decisions that could affect\neveryone in the country? Are there\ninstances where the arts graduates\nwho usually run the country could be\nbetter placed to make decisions about\nscientific issues?\n\u201cUltimately any individual\nclinician has the major responsibility\nto do the best for their patients, and\nof course if you were my patient, you\nwould expect that.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes you realise that\nkeeping this patient alive is probably\nquite difficult to justify, when for\nthe same expense you could probably\ntreat 30-40 other people, so I think\nthat\u2019s always an issue.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose in my case you could\nlevel your finger at me and say\n\u2018you\u2019ve been treating patients\nwith infertility, which isn\u2019t a life-threatening condition\u2019, but of course\nit causes massive disruption, and the\npain of infertility is every bit as bad\nas the pain of an osteoarthritic hip,\nand you wouldn\u2019t think twice about\ntreating that.\u201d\n\u201cSo how do you become objective\nas a parliamentarian when you\nfeel quite subjectively outraged?\nThat outrage is sometimes useful,\nsometimes you need to stand up and\nsay this is outrageous, as we did with\nthe health reform act in 2012, and I\nthink the only fault we had there was\nnot saying it loud enough.\u201d\n\u201cI think we should have said more\nfirmly that this is a very bad piece of\nlegislation, which now, of course, the\ngovernment admits, but only once\nthe damage has already been done.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a great thinker, but I\nthink the strength I may have in\nparliament is the ability to give\npassionate speeches on things I feel\ndeeply about, and I think that\u2019s quite\nimportant in politics.\u201d\n\n"

ChemEng students from all\nyears turned out for the first ever\nmatch that this fledgling team would\nplay, a pre-season friendly against\nQueen\u2019s Tower Rangers. The team\nwarmed up, psyched up, kicked off,\nand then duly lost 6-4. Not exactly the\ndream start that had been imagined.\nWhile this defeat would have\ndemoralised most teams, the men of\nChemEng did not falter. With the\nmanager drawing up new tactics,\nthe team arrived at Hyde Park for\nthe first game of the season against\nfeared veterans Linstead Hall, and\nproceeded to comprehensively\ndominate the match (and literally\nsend Linstead into mid-match crisis\ntalks) to seal a 3-1 win.\nThe rise to the top had started.\nThroughout the first month of\nthe season, ChemEng remained\nundefeated with a string of victories,\ncatapulting them to the top of the\nleague. But a shock 1-0 defeat to\nPembridge and Parsons Hall in\nweek 5 brought them crashing back\nto terra firma, bringing about a\nshaky run of form. Entering the\nseason\u2019s latter stages, ChemEng\nhad only won two of the last five\nmatches. The dream looked in peril,\nbut ChemEng believed; the team\nrallied, impressively routing all of its\nremaining opponents to claim the\nleague title with one game to spare!\nHowever, the greatest challenge was\nyet to come \u2013 the cup final. Having\nprogressed through the quarters\nand semis with decisive wins over\nXenia and Beit, ChemEng arrived at\nthe hallowed grounds of Harlington\nfor the final. After a few drills and\na quick warm-up, they kicked off\nagainst Southside. This match proved\nto be both the strangest and toughest\nyet; Lotanna Agu (the Yaya Tour\u00e9 of\nChemEng) injuring himself in the line\nof duty after 20 minutes, Mayowa\n\u201cMario Balotelli\u201d Okulate abusing\nthat finesse button to score the only\ngoal in the game at the 60 minute\nmark, before refusing to celebrate\n(\u201cwhy always me?\u201d), Sandy Nimmo\ntrying, and failing, to skill the\nopposition striker as the last man just\noutside the box, forcing our keeper\nAnkush Nehra to perform a David\nDe Gea-esque save to keep us ahead,\nand Jonathan Trofimov managing\nto instigate a \u201cfracas\u201d involving\n\u201cfisticuffs\u201d by just looking at someone\n(luckily it did not evolve into a\n\u201ckerfuffle\u201d), with the ref refusing to\nsend anyone off because he had left\nhis cards at home.\nAfter a tense second half, under\npressure from a valiant Southside\nteam, the final whistle was blown, and\nChemEng were the winners, claiming\nthe Double for ChemEng in its first\nyear of formation.\nMax, Will and the team had\nfulfilled that vision set out (not) so\nlong ago.\nThe ChemEng Soc team won the final 1-0 Photo: ChemEng Soc Football team\nManager Will Batchelor reports as ChemEng Soc achieve dream\nHockey win LUSL Cup against King\u2019s GKT\nHaving won a hard fought\nbattle against RUMS in the\nsemi-final, IC travelled to\nRoyal Holloway to take part in the\nfinal of the London Universities Cup\nagainst King\u2019s GKT on Saturday.\nGKT had previously beaten IC in\na pre-season friendly in the only\nmeeting of the two teams this season,\nfinishing 2nd\nin the BUCS league\nabove IC meant that on paper they\nwere surely favourites to take the\nCup title. However, coach Cooper\nhad prepared a game plan tailored\ntheir style of play and because of this\nIC were confident in their ability to\ncause an upset.\nThe game began at a high tempo\nwith good passing interplay displayed\nby both teams. Defensively IC were\nthe stronger side, Pollock was able\nto completely shut down GKT\u2019s\nuseful right back and the rest of\nGKT\u2019s attacking efforts were like\nwater breaking on rock against the\never sturdy defensive line. IC looked\nthreatening however and about 10\nminutes into the game, a searching\naerial from Hedgecock managed\nto find Dittmar high up the pitch.\nDittmar threaded the ball through\nto Pollock at the top of the D who\ncalmly slipped the ball between the\nkeeper\u2019s legs and into the goal.\nIC continued to apply pressure in\nattack. Following one of his signature\npenetrating dribbles, super-sub\nCerulus played a ball through to\nBreakey in the D. With the keeper\ncharging out to meet the ball, Breakey\nonly had to touch the ball to Dittmar\non his left, who passed the ball into\nthe open net.\nGKT fought back in the second\nhalf and managed to level the score\nwith a rehearsed penalty corner and\na flick, their relief did not last long\nhowever. A clever pick of the ball by\nDittmar from a GKT defender saw a\npass through to Breakey at the top of\nthe D. Keen to impress his girlfriend\nsupporting on the side-line, he\ndrilled a reverse stick shot into the\nbottom left hand corner of the goal.\nGKT again equalised, but further\naggression from IC yielded results,\na baseline run from Cerulus gifting\nBreakey with an easy finish, for 4-3.\nIC\u2019s final goal was from yet another\npinpoint cross by Cerulus to gift Price\nwith an easy tap in.\nSensing that defeat was upon them\nGKT threw everything they had at\nthe IC defence in the dying moments\nof the game. GKT scrambled a goal\nback, but the IC defence refused to be\nbeaten again, with some particularly\nheroic tackles from Murray helping\nto retain the 5-4 lead. Thanks to\narguably their best game of hockey\nall season, and some top drawer\ntactics from Cooper, IC secured a well-deserved win and the LUSL Cup title.\nMan of the Match: Will Murray\nStarting Line Up: Oli MeyerBothling (GK), Will Murray, Jonny\nJones, Lars Mejnertsen, Rowan\nHedgecock, Anthony Vaquero,\nNadesh Ramanathan, Richard\nPollock, Jack Rawson, Henrik\nDittmar, James Breakey\nRICHARD POLLOCK\nIC HOCKEY\nChemEng Soc beat Southside to Cup Glory\nPhoto: IC Hockey\nPhoto: IC Hockey\n\n"

Cale Tilford is here to take us on a journey through\nfive of his current favourite comic series, perfect for those\nunacquainted with the art form\nComic Books: Where to Start?\nThe Wicked + The Divine\nDescender\nFinally free from his contractual\nobligations at DC Comics,Jeff\nLemire starts his career at Image\nwith one of his most interesting\nconcepts yet.Descender takes place\nin the far future where,after a series\nof unfortunate events,all artificial\nintelligence has been banned.\nSuccess seemed inevitable for the\ncreative team after Sony secure the\nfilm rights to the series before its\nfirst issue had even been released,\nand this gamble might just pay off\nas the first issue is easily one of the\nbest so far this year.\nLemire tells the story of the last\nrobot in the galaxy,a young android\nnamed TIM-21,as he is hunted down\nby those who blame his kind for\ntheir destruction in a disaster that\nwiped out billions of lives.The major\nevents in the first issue unfold from\nthe perspective of Dr.Quon,a once\nleading scientist whose job is made\nobsolete after AI is outlawed.Ten\nyears after the disaster that ravaged\nthe core planets,his services are\nrequired again when TIM-21 omits\na signal that alerts the galaxy of\nhis presence.With AI very much\na hot topic at the moment (from\nExMachina to the scaremongering\ncomments of Elon Musk and Steven\nHawking),it\u2019s interesting to see\nLemire join the discussion with a\ntale that so far feels very reminiscent\nof Spielberg\u2019s A.I.Artificial\nIntelligence.\nNever before have I been so blown\naway by the art in a comic.Dustin\nNguyen\u2019s work with watercolours is\nphenomenal and is a good enough\nThe Wicked + The Divine #7 Photo: Image Comics\nDescender Photo: Image Comics\nHoward the Duck\nSpider-Gwen\nSilver Surfer\nhilarious dialogue pokes fun at the\nfictional world around him and the\nwonderful inconsistencies that have\nbeen allowed to fester over time.If\nyou\u2019re expecting something along\nthe same lines as SexCriminals you\u2019ll\nbe disappointed,but Zdarsky\u2019s first\nmajor attempt at writing certainly\nprovides laughs,although it\u2019s\noften at the expense of the well-established universe that Howard\ntheDuck is part of.\nJoe Quinones\u2019art is fantastic at\ndisplaying the varied emotions of\nthe duck detective and his super-powered friends; his modern style is\ncomplemented well by Rico Renzi\u2019s\nbright colours,and the work on\nHoward\u2019s outfit feels appropriately\nretro,furthering the idea that he is\nout of time,in a world that is not his\nown.\nWith a first issue packed full of\ncameos and clever references,it will\nbe interesting to see if the character\nof Howard the Duck alone will be\nenough carry the series in its future\nissues.\nAlso,with the upcoming demise\nof the multiverse (in this year\u2019s\nSecret Wars event) I\u2019m curious as\nto where HowardtheDuck will end\nup,especially since Marvel have a\nhistory of ending series before they\nreach their prime.\nHowardtheDuck#1isoutnowon\nMarvelComics\nThe recent Spider-Verse comic\nevent introduced a number of\nnew superheroes to the Marvel\nmultiverse.The most popular of\nthese was Spider-Gwen,the SpiderWoman/Gwen Stacy of Earth-65,\nwho is forced to face off against her\nown reality\u2019s version of Peter Parker\nwhen he mutates into a lizard-like\ncreature.\nJason Latour subverts many of the\narchetypes in Spider-Man origin\nstories,with Spider-Gwen feared\nas a dangerous vigilante by her\ncommunity rather than the usual\nfriendly neighbourhood SpiderMan.It\u2019s great to see a creative team\nthat\u2019s attempting to try something\ndifferent,and with Spider-Gwen\nLatour has written a character with\na surprising amount of depth.This\nalternative take on Gwen Stacy is\nnothing like her counterpart in the\nmainline Marvel universe\u2013she\u2019s\nbadass and the drummer for the\nfantastically named punk rock band\n\u2018The Mary Janes\u2019.\nRobbi Rodriguez\u2019s thin lines are\nable to capture the fast-paced\nand frantic movements of SpiderGwen and her foes,whilst his use\nof caricaturistic body and facial\nstructures works well to display the\ntruly villainous nature of the tales\u2019\nantagonists.Unlike many of his\npeers,who have moved away from\ncomic sound effects,Rodriguez uses\nthem to great effect,effortlessly\nthe Silver Surfer,the silver-clad\nhumanoid is the former herald\nof Galactus,a massive planet-consuming cosmic entity,and rides\na silver surfboard across the cosmos.\nAs a herald,he was tasked with\nscouring the galaxy to find suitable\nplanets for his master to destroy,\nhowever,upon reaching Earth he\nwas so inspired that he turned\nagainst Galactus to save the planet\nfrom destruction.\nThe current arc examines the\nSurfer\u2019s past relationship with his\nplanet hungry master and the looks\nat the impact he has had across the\ngalaxy.Responsible for the deaths\nof billions,it\u2019s interesting to see\nthe Surfer come to terms with the\ndamage he has caused.It\u2019s rare that\nwe get something of such emotional\ngravitas in a superhero comic,so I\ncommend Slott for his effort.\nMichael and Laura Allred combine\nto provide their best work yet; the\npop-art style that the couple is so\nfamous for is a perfect match for\nthe Slott\u2019s impressive imagination.\nEach new creature and planet that\nis introduced seems more wacky\nand inventive than the last,and\nwhen Galactus is finally revealed his\nentrance is as epic as hoped.\nSilver Surfer is a comic that needs\nto be read; it\u2019s fun,light-hearted,\nand easy to follow.If you\u2019re a fan\nof exploratory sci-fi then this is the\ncomic for you.\nHoward the Duck Photo: Image Comics\nSpider-Gwen Photo: Image Comics\nSilver Surfer Photo: Image Comics\nGillen\u2019s fondness of British (and\nAmerican) music is what really\nbrings his world to life,with each\nGod borrowing their identity from a\nrock or pop icon.\nFor example,Lucifer (or Luci)\nstyles herself as a female Bowie.\nOther gods take inspiration from\nmusicians such as Daft Punk or\nRihanna,and it\u2019s not often not just\ntheir image that they share\u2013Gillen\nwrites many of these characters in\nsuch a way that they channel the\npersonality of the celebrity that\nthey embody. The series is also\nlittered with pop culture references\nand song lyrics which will be\nimmediately familiar to those who\nhave grown up listening to Britpop\u2019s\nfinest.\nJamie McKelvie\u2019s art is some of\nthe best in the industry.His realistic\nstyle helps create an astonishingly\nbelievable world,and his work on\nfacial expressions adds further\nemotion to Gillen\u2019s excellent script.\nTheWicked+TheDivineis particularly\nrenowned for its eye catching cover\ndesigns,which so far have exhibited\nMcKelvie\u2019s excellent character\ndesigns for each of the twelve gods\nin turn.\nMy only complaint with this\nseries,which I feel is common with\nmuch of Gillen\u2019s work,is that the\ndialogue is often too confusing (and\nculture reference heavy),requiring\nyou to be fully immersed in the\nrapidly expanding world that he is\nconstructing.Once invested though,\nTheWicked+TheDivine is a world\nyou\u2019ll never want to leave.\nTheWicked+TheDivine#8isoutnow\nonImageComics.\nreason alone to pick up this\nseries.In the first issue,we get a\nglimpse of a number of different\nenvironments each of which\nNguyen is able to distinctively\nportray through his excellent\nuse of colours and perspective.\nThe most notable of these is a\nmoon where the bluish greys of\nan abandoned mining colony are\ncontrasted against the darkness of\nspace,reflecting the loneliness of\nthe comic\u2019s young protagonist.\nDescender is a triumph and\nsolidifies Lemire as one of the best\ntalents in the industry.I can\u2019t wait\nto read the next issue.\nDescenderisoutnowonImage\nComics.\nTheWicked+TheDivine was\nonce described as the spiritual\nsuccessor to Kieron Gillen and\nJamie McKelvie\u2019s Phonogram,the\nBritpop inspired comic series\n\u2018where music is magic\u2019,and whilst\nit borrows many of the themes\nof their earlier collaboration this\nseries is far more grounded in\nreality.\nSet in a world where every\nninety years twelve humans are\nincarnated as gods with two\nyears left to live,their new work\nexamines the modern celebrity\nand the associated fandoms.\nNow in its second arc,the series\ncontinues to explore this world\nthrough the perspective of British\nteenager Laura,one of the many\nhardcore fans of the group of gods\nknown as The Pantheon.\nMost will know the Silver Surfer\nfrom his appearance in the\nspectacularly shit 2007 film,\nFantastic4:RiseoftheSilverSurfer,\nwhich continues to haunt many\nMarvel fans to this day.Luckily,\nDan Slott\u2019s portrayal of this\ncharacter does far more justice to\none of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby\u2019s\nfinest creations.Already on its\ntenth issue,the series continues\nto provide excitement and oddity\nonly rivalled by DoctorWho.Each\nissue explores a different part\nof Marvel\u2019s expansive universe\nwith Norrin Radd (AKA the Silver\nSurfer) and his earthly companion\nDawn Greenwood as our guide.\nFor those not familiar with\nblending them in with his art and\nRico Renzi\u2019s garish colours.\nIt is therefore unfortunate that I\ncan only recommend this comic to\nthose who have already invested\nsome time in the current Marvel\ncomic universe.To fully appreciate\nand understand the first few\nissues you must possess at least\na basic knowledge of Spider-Man\nenemies and allies.Furthermore,\nit is worrying when certain aspects\nof a character,such as their origin-story,are not explained.Whilst\nSpider-Gwen #1 and #2 at least\nattempt to summarise SpiderGwen\u2019s story so far,they fall short\nof giving a necessary introduction\nto new comic book readers.\nI\u2019ll admit that even as a big comic\nfan,I\u2019d never heard of Howardthe\nDuck until its brief cameo in last\nyear\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy\npost-credits scene.This new\nseries from Chip Zdarsky (most\nfamous for his work illustrating\ndildo-fights in Image Comics\u2019\nSexCriminals) follows Howard,\na handsome anthropomorphic\nduck,as he explores a world\u201che\u2019s\ngrown accustomed to.\u201d\nAfter the first few pages it\u2019s\napparent that this comic is about\nfar more than a talking duck\u2013\nZdarsky uses Howard\u2019s role as a\nprivate investigator to position\nhim as an outsider in the Marvel\nuniverse.The witty and often\n\n"

Satellite\ndata had previously showed that the\nTotten Glacier has been thinning\nsignificantly.\nDescribed as East Antarctica\u2019s most\nrapidly changing glacier, the ice shelf\nis around 150 kilometres long by 30\nkilometres wide. It is a major outlet\nfor the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, the\nlargest mass of ice on Earth, which\ncovers 98% of the continent.\nIt was previously believed to be\nrelatively stable compared to the\nsmaller West Antarctic Ice Sheet,\nwhich loses more than 150 cubic\nkilometres of ice every year.\nSurveying the area with radar\nand other geophysical techniques,\nthe team of researchers generated a\nmap of the topographical landscape\nunderlying the glacier.\nInstead of the cooler waters\npreviously thought to surround the\nEast Antarctic Ice Sheet, the data\nrevealed a 5 kilometre wide valley\nrunning underneath the glacier,\nwhich exposes the base of the ice to\nwarm ocean water.\nThis intrusion of warmer water is\naccelerating the thinning of the ice\nshelf. While the thin ice at the edges\nof ice sheets can float on the ocean,\ninland ice is \u2018grounded\u2019 and in contact\nwith the bedrock.\nThe newly discovered valley exposes\nthe grounded edge of the ice sheet to\nwarm water, leading to significant\nmelting of the glacier. With climate\nchange raising the temperature of\nthe oceans, sea levels are predicted to\nrise at a rate of around one metre per\ncentury.\nTotten Glacier could represent a\nmajor component of this rise, with\nenough ice draining from the East\nAntarctic Ice Sheet to raise global sea\nlevels by 3.5 metres.\nAny destabilisation of the Totten\nGlacier could leave more of the\ninland ice vulnerable to change, said\nProfessor Martin Siegert, Co-Director\nof the Grantham Institute at Imperial\nCollege London and a co-author of\nthe study.\n\u201cOnce a certain region starts\nto change, the implications for\nthe connected ice are potentially\nsignificant.\n\u201cWe are using computer modelling\nto understand whether changes in\nTotten Glacier could lead to changes\nin both adjacent and more distant\nplaces in Antarctica.\n\u201cThe change at Totten Glacier itself\nis significant and concerning. It\u2019s\nonly one glacier, but it\u2019s changing\nnow and it is significant for sea levels\nglobally. The 3.5 metre rise may take\nseveral centuries to complete, but\nnow the process has started it is likely\nirreversible.\n\u201cThis is another example of how\nhuman-induced climate change\ncould be triggering major changes\nwith knock-on impacts that will be\nfelt globally\u201d. Professor Siegert and\nhis colleagues are planning to map\nmore regions of the Antarctic ice to\nfurther understand the dynamics of\nthe continent.\nA research plane flies over Totten Glacier Photo: Imperial College London\nCECILY JOHNSON\nSECTION EDITOR\nPhilip Kent caught up with the winners on results night\nHighest ever voter\nturnout as Big Elections\ncome to a close\nLast Friday saw the end of\nanother year of campaigning\nand voting for the Imperial\nCollege Union sabbatical positions,\nwith the results of the Big Elections\n2015 announced during the results\nparty in Metric.\nThe election, which also featured\nthe Liberation Officers, Constituent\nUnion positions and a large number\nof clubs and societies positions, once\nagain resulted in the Union taking\nthe largest turnout in England and\nWales; once again The University\nof St. Andrews in Scotland took the\ncrown for the largest turnout in the\nUK. The number of postgraduate\nstudents voting was also up 50% on\nlast year.\nThe total number of voters was also\nup on last year, by nearly 750, with\nthe rate of people voting being on the\nwhole much greater than the year\nbefore.\nNext year\u2019s President will be\nLucinda Sandon-Allum, who got\n3152 votes, while Luke Armitage took\n1016 and RON 552. The Returning\nOfficers told attendees at the party\nthat this was the highest number of\nvotes received by a Union President\ncandidate in the history of the Union.\nLucinda told Felix about the elections,\n\u201cI am absolutely thrilled to have\nbeen elected as Union President! A\nhuge thank you to my phenomenal\ncampaign team who played a massive\npart in making this happen and an\nequally big thank you to everyone\nwho voted for me.\n\u201cThe last two weeks of campaigning\nhave been a great opportunity to\ntalk to so many different groups of\nstudents from all areas of the College.\nI am very excited to start putting my\nmanifesto points into action next\nyear and bettering the student voice\nand experience\u201d.\nThe Deputy Presidents were\nBen Howitt for Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies), Chun-Yin San\nfor Deputy President (Education),\nand Christopher Kaye for Deputy\nPresident (Finance and Services).\nCyin San said, \u201cA huge thank\nyou to everyone who voted \u2013 very\nproud to have been part of such a\nlarge democratic vote.

The aim\nnext term is to get organised and get\ntalking to people, so that we go out of\nthis year ready to start the next\u201d.\nChris told us, \u201cI\u2019m very excited\nabout being able to implement some\nchanges very quickly. Alex, the\nincumbent DPFS, is very keen to help\nme get the groundwork sorted for my\nyear\u2019s start, and I\u2019m very grateful to\nhim for that.\n\u201cThe sabbatical team this year have\nbeen fantastic, have had a superb\ndynamic together, and I feel I\u2019ve\nmade some friends for life. Next\nyear\u2019s sabbatical team have big shoes\nto fill, but we relish the challenge.\n\u201cTo paraphrase the Queen, I look\nforward to continuing to serve our\ngreat Imperial family to which we all\nbelong\u201d.\nMeanwhile Grace Rahman will\nbe next year\u2019s Felix Editor, and the\nstudent trustees will be Zain Rizvi\nand Serena Yuen, who dramatically\nmoved from second to first place in\nthe final round of voting.\nThe Live Statistics dashboard made\nits return once again, with Faculty of\nEngineering this year beating Natural\nSciences to be the top faculty in terms\nof turnout.

We caught\nup with Layla over lunch.\nPlabon: Tell us a bit about\nyourself. How did you get into\npolitics?\nLayla: I have a very international\nbackground, my mum is Palestinian\nand my dad is British, but he was\na diplomat so I grew up moving\naround everywhere. I ended up\nsettling in the UK for secondary\neducation and went to Imperial to\ndo physics. I was there from 2000 to\n2003. After that I went straight into\nthe classroom and became a physics\nteacher, and it was teaching really\nthat got me into politics.\nI ended up doing masters at\nthe Institute of Education in\ncomparative education, trying to\napply the scientific method to social\nscience. Having grown up sort of a\nbit of everywhere, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d\nquite appreciated how the education\nsystem in Britain grew up over\ntime and learnt that actually a lot\nof what both the Labour and Tory\ngovernments had done over the\nlast 20 to 30 years in the education\nsystem was the total opposite of\nwhat people wanted, which is the\nidea that if you are a child it doesn\u2019t\nreally matter where you are born;\nrich family, poor family, what colour\nyour skin is, it shouldn\u2019t matter, you\nshould have the same opportunity as\neveryone else.\nUnfortunately the education\nsystem in this country, by and large\ndoes not provide that, it tends to\nreinforce stratification in society\nrather than helping it. So at that\npoint, I decided to become a MP, to\naffect change in education, as a lot of\nthe policy is driven at that level.\nI looked across the manifestos\nand the policies of all the political\nparties, and I decided that in fact\nthe Liberal Democrats had the best\npolicy when it came to education. It\nwas evidence-based policy, based on\nwhat works, not ideologically driven.\nAnd so I decided I would rather\nspend the rest of my life fighting\nfor something I actually believed\nin, than going with one of the major\nparties and almost guaranteeing\nmyself a seat in Parliament. And\nthat brings me very much to where I\nam now, where I am pleased to stand\nin a seat where I actually do stand\na very good chance of winning and\nhope to be able to affect that kind of\nchange when I become an MP.\nP: How has your scientific\nbackground helped you in politics?\nL: You\u2019d be surprised at how many\npeople in Parliament have no sense\nof numeracy at all. Not least not\nunderstanding what uncertainty\nmeans. A classic example of course\nbeing climate change deniers who\nseem to think that 5% uncertainty\non models as complex as that is a bad\nthing.\nIn fact, we all know that that\u2019s a\nreally good margin of error when\nyou\u2019re dealing with models that\ncomplex. And at least being able to\nunderstand some of the underlying\nstatistics to data, which is then used\nto drive policy, is all about. So on\nthat level I found it very interesting\ngoing into politics because I look at it\nfrom that point of view: What\u2019s the\ndata telling me? What\u2019s the direction\nof travel? How can we affect change\nand help use data to help us to make\nthat change? So to that end I find\nthe Liberal Democrats actually are\nvery good at looking at policy and\nusing policy at a grassroots level and\nmaking policy at conference through\nvoting.\nMy physics background is\nhopefully unique and I\u2019m hoping\nthat\u2019ll bring something different\nto the vast majority of lawyers and\nother social scientists who are there\nnow.\nP: Political apathy is generally\nquite high amongst students,\nespecially at Imperial, which is a\nscience University. How would you\ngo about solving that?\nL: I disagree with the question; I\ndon\u2019t think people are politically\napathetic. I think they actually care\ndeeply about a lot of issues, they\u2019re\njust not necessarily party political\nand they are quite disillusioned with\nthe current system. I do think that\nthe way politics is happening in this\ncountry is changing, particularly\nwith the use of social media and the\nInternet. People are much more in\ntouch with MPs. From my point of\nview in Oxford West and Abingdon\nI think that means being a very\npresent MP in your constituency.\nI believe that it is your voters at the\nend of the day that are your bosses;\nthere\u2019s no one else who can hire and\nfire you, only them and you have to\nalways remember that, so I intend\nto be a very, very conscientious\nconstituency MP. But at the same\ntime I think you need to be using\nnew technology to actively engage\nwith people on policy issues that you\ncare about.\nFor example, I do hope to be a\nchampion for science, particularly\nthe science budget in Parliament. At\nthe moment we are the only party\nwho have committed to ring-fencing\nit and I would like to make sure that\nwhoever ends up in government\nwill ring-fence the science recession\ndevelopment budget. But in order to\ndo that I\u2019m going to need to lobby\nnot just people within Parliament\nbut to get people from outside\nParliament with similar interests\nin to have their voices heard, and\nthe best way I think of doing that is\nthrough things like social media.\nSo there is no quick-fix answer, I\nthink it is changing over time but\none thing I would encourage people\nto do is definitely go out and vote\nand even if you spoil your ballot I\u2019d\nrather you just gave it a go and went\nand learned about the process and\ntried to look some people up..\nP: What do you think is the\ngreatest problem facing students\ntoday?\nL: I think there are two aspects of it.\nStudents themselves are definitely\nfacing a cost of living crisis and\nthat\u2019s the thing I\u2019m hearing about\nmost, more in fact than lowering\ntuition fees. I think that\u2019s a bit of\ngimmick that Labour have brought\nin actually. I would much rather any\nextra money to help students goes\ninto beefing up maintenance grants,\nbecause so many students find that\nthe cost of living in so many cities in\nthe UK is unaffordable.\nIn the future though I think it\u2019s\ndefinitely the fact that it\u2019s so hard\nto get a job as a young person and\nwhen you leave University you\u2019re\nquite often stuck in a catch-22 of\nyou have no experience so they won\u2019t\ngive you a job to get the experience.\nThis is why the starter jobs idea is\nso important. The way to do that\nis to definitely tackle the deficit,\nmake sure you\u2019re doing things that\nare good for business. We definitely\nneed to do more to make sure that\nbusinesses are focussing on the 21-25 year old bracket and not filling\nthose jobs with people in their 30s\nwho were made redundant during\nMembers of the Imperial Liberal Democrats met with Layla Moran over lunch. Photo: Plabon Saha\nthe recession. We need to make sure\nthat it\u2019s an equitable and fair hiring\nprocess. This is why I believe that\nyou should have age, sex and name\nredaction on applications because it\nshouldn\u2019t matter how old you are, it\nshould matter what your skills are\nas to which jobs you end up getting.\nThat\u2019s an example of something\nwe\u2019ve been pushing for within\nParliament and we\u2019ve got a long way\nto go but I think that something like\nthat would really help not just young\npeople but also people of ethnic\n\"It was\nteaching\nthat really\ngot me into\npolitics.\"\n\"You\u2019d be\nsurprised\nat how\nmany\npeople in\nParliament\nhave no\nsense of\nnumeracy\nat all.\"\n\u201cStudents\nthemselves\nare\ndefinitely\nfacing a\ncost of\nliving\ncrisis.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lib\nDems have\nvery few\nsafe seats.\nBut I like\nthe idea of\nfighting\nfor what\nI\u2019ve earned\nrather than\nbeing given\nanything.\u201d\nPlabon Saha interviews the Liberal Democrat parliamentary\ncandidate for Oxford West and Abingdon\nminority backgrounds and other\nminority communities.\nP: So you mentioned the issue\nof maintenance grants. However\npeople who get good maintenance\ngrants also get good bursaries\nfrom the University and good\nloans, so they\u2019re not actually the\nones in trouble. The trouble is in\nthe middle where you have people\nwho don\u2019t get any bursaries, no\nmaintenance grants just because,\nlets\u2019 say, their parents both earn\n\u00a321k and that puts them out of\nthe bracket.\nL: That\u2019s exactly the population I\u2019m\ntalking about.\nP: But then you have the issue\nof increasing the maintenance\nloan, increases the total debt\nand that creates pressure on the\ngovernment to service that debt.\nL: That\u2019s right. I think it\u2019s right. I\npersonally would have been someone\nwould not have voted for fees. I think\nyou end up giving back much more\ninto society when you have a degree\nthan if you don\u2019t; you earn more\nmoney so you pay more tax and over\ntime that works. But we are not in a\nposition where we are able to promise\nthat in the next election. But I do\nthink it\u2019s ok for the government to\nbe putting up cheap loans so that\npeople can get their first degrees.\nI\u2019m also pretty proud that we\nmade the system more progressive;\nthere are more students from poorer\nsocioeconomic backgrounds going\nto University now than ever before,\nbecause they\u2019re worked out that\nit\u2019s actually better for them in the\nlong term. But it\u2019s not easy in this\npolitical climate.\nP: Animal testing is currently a\nbig issue at Imperial. What is your\nview on animal testing?\nL: My view is that there\u2019s a place for\nit, but it has to be done as an absolute\nlast resort. I think that\u2019s it\u2019s true\nthat there are some protocols that\ncould be done with modelling rather\nthan on the animals themselves, but\nI think that there\u2019s undoubtedly a\nplace for it.\nOn one hand, I am an animal\nlover and I hate to see that animals\nare used in anything, but also I do\nbelieve that if you are developing,\nfor example, a vaccine for cats, you\nreally ought to test it on cats. And\na lot of these people who are anti\nany kind of animal testing forget\nthat that applies as well to animal\nmedicines.\nThere are some no-go areas,\nanything to do with makeup,\nanything to do with anything\ncosmetic is totally not okay. But\nwhen it comes to cutting-edge\nscience, I do believe in science, I\nbelieve that science has a place in\nmaking the world a better place\nfor everybody and that involves\nsometimes, in rare occasions using\nanimals. Britain has a very good\nrecord on this, I have to say, and\nwe\u2019ve got some of the most stringent\nlegislation in the world to do with\nanimal testing. The balance could\nstill be that we have an even higher\nburden of proof that you need to\nuse animals and I still think it\nneeds to be under constant review\nwith the way science changes and\nwhat we use if for. But by and\nlarge I am supportive in the right\ncircumstances.\nP: What is the Lib Dems policy\nthat you most disagree with?\nL: Not many. It used to be nuclear.\nWhen I first joined the party; I\u2019m\nnot exactly pro-nuclear, but I am\npro-decarbonisation and I think that\nsometimes there\u2019s a root for nuclear\nin the different models that we can\nlook at, but now actually the party\nhas come around to my point of view,\nwhich is great.\nI wrote the party\u2019s policy on\nfracking, which is basically extreme\nscepticism, but as a scientist I am not\ngoing to say no to a test well, because\nI think you ought to see the extent of\nthe problem. So actually nowadays, I\nhave to say, there\u2019s not much.\nWe don\u2019t go far enough with\neducation policy. At the moment our\npolicy is that we are okay with free\nschools. The evidence suggests that\nfree schools are detrimental to the\nsystem as a whole, and would like to\nsee them gotten rid of completely, so\nI would like to see us pull away from\nthose, as an example. But it\u2019s bits and\nbobs, there\u2019s not very much that is\nsubstantive in the party that I don\u2019t\nagree with anymore.\nP: Parliament is a male dominated\narea and you\u2019d be one of the few\nfemales there if elected. What\nwould you do to address the\ngender balance in Parliament?\nL: Well just being there, I hope,\nwill help. I think one of the issues\nfor a lot of women is that there\naren\u2019t very many people like them\nin Parliament, so it\u2019s about partly\ncreating a role model. That said, I\u2019m\nnot sure I would necessarily have\ngone for it in the way that I did if\nit wasn\u2019t for people like Jo Swinson\nand Willot, who are young and had\ntheir families while they were in\nParliament.\nYou know, there\u2019s another side to\nmy life; I don\u2019t think you should get\nrid of your personal life because you\nwant to be a Parliamentarian. It\u2019s\nimportant to see role models like\nthem who have done both, and done\nit well. So I don\u2019t think there is an\neasy answer.\nSomething to bear in mind is the\nreason the Lib Dems have such a\npoor record on this is because we\ndon\u2019t have safe seats, so I\u2019m part\nof the leadership program in the\nparty where minority candidates\nare helped; given extra training, and\nwe\u2019re told we are some of the best\ncandidates in the party. Yet, we have\nvery few safe seats.\nSo this seat, which is basically on\na knife-edge and will all depend on\nthe size of the campaign is almost as\ngood as it gets within the Lib Dems.\nIt\u2019s so uncertain. We don\u2019t have the\nluxury of being able to parachute\nanyone. But then I don\u2019t think that\u2019s\na bad thing either, because I like the\nidea of fighting for what I\u2019ve earned\nrather than being given anything.\nP: Describe yourself with a movie\nor song title.\nL: \u2018Life is a Rollercoaster\u2019 by Ronan\nKeating. I hate that song, by the way,\nbut it\u2019s a good title.\nP: If money was no problem, what\nwould be the first thing you\u2019d do?\nL: I\u2019d buy a house. I\u2019m so desperate\nto buy a house, and I can\u2019t afford\nit. What they don\u2019t tell you about\ncampaigning is that it takes up a lot\nof your time and a lot of your money,\nand you don\u2019t get paid as a candidate.\nSo, by the end of this process, I will\nhave nothing left in the bank.\nSo yeah, if I won the lottery or\nsomething, that would be awesome,\nI\u2019d buy a house, that\u2019d be cool.\nP: Were you part of any societies\nat Imperial?\nL: I was University Quiz Master for\na little while, which was super fun.\nOn Wednesday night at the Union\nI would write the quizzes and then\nargue with people when they said\nmy answers were wrong, so that was\nreally fun.\nFor a while I was part of the Jazz &\nRock Society, but I went to couple of\nmeetings and that was pretty much\nit.\nP: House of Cards or Game of\nThrones?\nL: No! I can\u2019t make that choice!\nThat\u2019s my answer.\nP: Who is your favourite Doctor\nWho?\nL: David Tennant.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 37\n20.03.2015\nFELIX\nTravel\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk Travel Editor Yung Nam Cheah\nTravel\nYung Nam Cheah discusses the ups and downs of getting your hands dirty abroad.\nWorking Holiday \u2013 the sustainable\nand immersive way to travel\nIhad been fascinated by the\nconcept of working holiday\nfor a while now and even more\nso when an old friend of mine\nembarked on her own journey\nto Australia with her boyfriend,\nupdating us on her 6-months\nadventure through social media. It\nseems to be a popular alternative\nfor many young people fresh out of\nUniversity who wants to travel but\nstill add something to their CV.\nCommon working holiday\ndestinations are Australia and\nCanada, appealing to the under-30s\nall over the world, with a year-long\nvisa that allows them to work and\ntravel. It allows you to finance your\ntravel on the road and allows you\nto stop and explore a destination\nlonger. Visiting a city for a few days\nis completely different to living and\nworking there; and there\u2019s truly no\nbetter way to immerse yourself and\nexperience the culture than to go and\nget your hands dirty.\nBefore you get all excited \u2013 going\non a working holiday is no walk in\nthe park. To make it easier for you all\nto decide whether you are cut out for\nthis, here\u2019s 3 main things to consider:\n1) You will be spending time away\nfrom your family and friends\nSure, with social media and the\nSkype call, it is easy to stay in\ntouch with everyone back home.\nBut remember this: you leave the\ncountry for a reason, don\u2019t waste\nyour days waiting for that call from\nhome. Make sure you call home\nonce a week and go out and enjoy\nyour new life. You will inevitably\nmiss out on birthdays and holidays\nwith the family, and it\u2019s likely that\nyou will feel lonely at some point in\nthe journey. Don\u2019t take this lightly\nbecause it can make or break a trip.\n2) What you want to get out of it\nThis might seem like a silly question,\nbut trust me when I tell you that it\u2019s\nimportant. Working holiday isn\u2019t a\nholiday, it\u2019s an experience. You will\nbe dependent only on yourself and\nwhen the money runs out (assuming\nthat you are not made out of cash) it\u2019s\nup to you yourself to earn the dosh to\nkeep yourself floating. You are most\nlikely to work rather unsavoury jobs,\nso if you are looking for a fun time\nthen consider saving up for a tour. A\nworking holiday is more for people\nwho want to challenge themselves,\nwork and have the opportunity to\nvisit a foreign country.\n3) Do you have the time? Once again,\na working holiday isn\u2019t a holiday. It\u2019s\ntime off where you are working in\njobs that are probably not what you\nwant to do for the rest of your life\nto sustain yourself when you travel.\nThis means you will be spending\nmonths away from your normal life,\nwhich might be the appealing point\nto some but not so much to others.\nIf after pondering through the\nquestions your answers are still\nyes, then you need to consider your\ndestinations. There\u2019s almost no\nboundary as to where you can go if\nyou set your heart on it.\nPersonally, the Down Under is\na top pick for me for all the right\nreasons. Boasting a wide variety\nof terrains from gorgeous sandy\nbeaches to the rugged out back,\nas well as home to the unique\nmarsupials and exotic wildlife,\nthere\u2019s an endless list of reasons\nto visit the amazing Oz... As I had\nmentioned before, Australia, as\nwell as New Zealand and Canada are\namong those that offer great youth\nvisas.\nAnother thing is languages and\ncultures, which are definitely on\nthe top of the consideration lists. It\nisn\u2019t easy working somewhere that\noperates in a vastly different way\nto the way back home, though that\nmight also be why it\u2019s so attractive\nto go. However, you also have\nproblems like visa application,\nvaccination where necessary and\nliving expenses. Then you need to\nworry about actually getting a job as\nwell as accommodation. And there\u2019s\nthe nitty gritty of bank accounts, tax\nnumbers and SIM cards. Like I said,\nit\u2019s no walk in the park.\nThis, again, winds back to why\npopular destinations are a good pick.\nMany companies, for example: STA\nTravel offer packages that helps you\nthrough the entire process, from\nvisa application to getting a job\nand securing the first few nights of\naccommodation on arrival. It might\nbe true that you won\u2019t be able to get\nvery nice, high earning jobs \u2013 but\nthat doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t hit the\nground running by preparing before\nyou leave.\nSome of you are probably\nwondering what the costs are, so here\nI am using Australia as an example\nand scoured the internet for the\ncheapest quotes I can find:\nSTA Travel: \u00a3299 (Originally \u00a3330\nbut is currently on sale until 20/3!)\nVisa first: \u00a3285 in 2 weeks, \u00a3315 in\n48 hours\nFor those of you who are\nwondering about the packages: most\noffer help with visa, tax, CV and\ngetting a job, as well as the first few\nnights of accommodation and even\nairport transfer. Some even throw\nin an orientation and an option for\na group flights. Here\u2019s a few that I\nfound:\nGap 360 : Starter package for \u00a3299\n(+Visa is another \u00a3300)\nBUNAC: Essential support package\nfor \u00a3359 (+Visa is another \u00a3310)\nSTA Travel: Starter package from\n\u00a3150 for 3 nights accommodation\non arrival (+Visa for now is another\n\u00a3299)\nIf you are more independent and\nonly want help on tax and bank etc,\nSTA Travel offer Tax pack and Bank\naccount for \u00a325 each.\nSo what are you waiting for? Go\nand emjoy the Down Under and\nescape the British weather!\nThis can be you with your new group of \u2018mates\u2019 chilling by the bridge side next year Photo: flicr\n\"You\nwill be\nspending\ntime away\nfrom your\nfamily\nand\nfriends....\"\n\"There is\nalmost no\nboundary\nas to where\nyou can go\nif you set\nyour hjeart\non it.\"\n\n"

Imperial College stormed\nto victory ahead of the Medics, with\nIC winning 15.5 games overall, and\nICSM winning 8.5 games.\nTeams from Hockey, Netball,\nFootball Basketball, Tennis,\nBadminton, Lacrosse, Squash,\nWaterpolo and Rugby played against\neach other throughout the day, with\nwins for either IC or the Medical\nteams counting towards who is\ndecided the overall winner at the end\nof the day.\nMatches took place at the newly\nacquired Heston, Harlington and\nEthos, with the two final games\nbetween the First XV Men\u2019s Rugby\nteams and the Women\u2019s rugby teams\ntaking place at the Stoop, based out in\nTwickenham, South West London.\nThe IC team won the men\u2019s game,\nwith the final score being 32-10 to IC.\nThe IC team also won the women\u2019s\ngame, although it was slightly closer,\nwith the final score being 15-12.\nThe women\u2019s match, the headline\ngame of the season, was slightly more\nfast paced, although shorter in length\nwith only 20 minutes to each half.\nThere was an injury and therefore\na substitution within the first two\nminutes of the match, but otherwise\nthey played a strong game.\nMan of the match was Sam Moorby,\nwho scored two tries for the IC team.\nThe \u201cMVP\u201d for the women\u2019s rugby\nwas Katherine Fok, who played for\nthe ICSM team.\nThe new Varsity trophy, a\nreplacement for the JPR Williams\nCup that has been traditionally\nawarded in previous years, was\nawarded to IC.\nGames started early on the in the\nday, with matches between the netball\nteams kicking off at 9.30am. The first\nthrough to the fifth teams played at\nHeston, with the ICSM team winning\nfour out of five matches.\nThe 1st\nthrough to the 4th\nFootball\nteams played at Heston too, with IC\nwinning three matches but the ICSM\n3rd\nteam beating the IC 3rds.\nThe 3rd\nand 2nd\nrugby teams played\nearlier in the day, with the 3rd\nIC\nteam beating the ICSM equivalent\nwith 10-19, whilst the ICSM 2nd\nteam\ndominated IC with 10-19.\nIn Basketball, the women\u2019s game\ntook place whilst the men\u2019s game took\nplace last week, based at the Copper\nBox at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic\nPark. The women\u2019s match ended in a\ndraw, whilst last week IC Basketball\nbeat the ICSM team.\nFor Mixed Tennis IC beat ICSM\n9-3, whilst the Mixed Lacrosse match\nended in a win for ICSM with the\nfinal score being 6-7. For Squash, the\nMen\u2019s 1st\nmatch ended in a 5-5 draw,\nwhilst the Women\u2019s first saw ICSM\nwin with a final score of 0-4.\nTwo badminton matches took place:\nthe IC Men\u2019s first thrashed ICSM\n6-2 whilst the IC Women\u2019s first also\nclaimed a victory over ICSM.\nFive hockey matches took place\nat Harlington: three for the men\u2019s\nhockey teams and two for the\nWomen\u2019s 2nd\nand 1st\nteams. The IC\nteams dominated ICSM for four out\nof five of the games, although the\nICSM Men\u2019s hockey 2nd\u2019s won on\npenalties.\nThe Women\u2019s IC rugby team won a close match 15-12 at The Stoop Photo: Ben Lester, throughbenslens.co.uk\nSteven Basher previews tonight\u2019s crunch game against UCL in Streatham\nVarsity Preview: Ice Hockey plays tonight\nTonight, the Imperial Devils Ice\nHockey team take on the UCL\nYetis in the 3rd\nannual \u201cLondon\nIce Varsity\u201d. The Devils will be eager\nto retain their unbeaten record,\nhaving triumphed two years in a row\nso far.\nFacing off at 20:00 at Streatham Ice\nArena, one of London\u2019s great sporting\nrivalries will be re-ignited in a fast-paced and aggressive showdown.\nReigning champions, the Imperial\nDevils, will be aiming to press home\ntheir Varsity dominance and come\naway with a 3rd\nwin in as many years,\nwhilst the UCL Yetis are looking to\nget off the mark with a first Varsity\nwin.\nLast year\u2019s contest saw Imperial\ntake the crown in a nail biting\nsudden-death penalty shootout.\nRegular time saw the lead change\nfour times, before UCL equalised\nwithin the last 10 minutes of the\ngame to send the game into overtime\nat 4-4. The Devils managed to make it\nthrough the extra period, only saved\nby the goalpost. But when it came to\nthe crunch, Imperial stepped up to the\nmark and goalkeeper Stefan Nubert\ncemented his MVP status by denying\nthe \ufb01nal Yeti penalty.\nWithout 3 goal hero Ryan Heaton\nand winning penalty scorer Max Fink\nto depend on this year, the Devils will\nbe looking to their ranks for a new\nsuperstar to emerge and solidify their\nposition of dominance. Captain and\ntop point-scorer Gus Zimmerman\nwill be leading the team from defence,\naiming to deny entrance to any and\nall Yetis.\nIn regular season games this year,\nthe Devils and Yetis are one win\napiece. Both contests were hotly\ncontested and the animosity between\nthe teams was rarely hidden. With\naggravator Ryan Ritchie once again\nappearing on the Imperial roster, any\noverflow in tempers could easily end\nin another Yeti hitting the ice after\none punch.\nThe event promises to be another\nspectacle this year, with an even\nlarger attendance. The Imperial\nAngels figure skating club will be\nmaking another appearance in the\npre-game show, demonstrating their\nincredible talents. Music will be\nprovided by Imperial\u2019s own Steve\nBasher, filling up the gaps between\nplays and adding to the sure-to-be\nincredible atmosphere.\nThe Devils have a point to prove\nand, with no love lost between the\nteams, a strong motivation to upstage\nthe Yetis once again. This event is not\none to miss out on!\n\u00a35 tickets available from http://\npo.st/ImperialIceVarsity until 17:30\ntoday, \u00a37 tickets available on the door\nthereafter.

A large\nblack screen looms past the entrance\ndoors of the V&A\u2019s Savage Beauty,\nshowing McQueen\u2019s illuminated face,\nwhich slowly morphs into a gold skull\nmask to the soundtrack of ominous\nmusic. I felt as if I was entering not\nonly the exhibition, but the mind of\nAlexander McQueen itself.\nThe exhibition, which broke records\nduring its residency at New York\u2019s\nMetropolitan Museum of Art in\n2011, is a series of 10 rooms, each\ndedicated to a prevailing concept\ncentral to McQueen\u2019s collections\nand vision as a whole, and follows a\nmore-or-less chronological pattern of\nMcQueen\u2019s collections, from his 1992\nCentral Saint Martins MA graduate\ncollection, to his last fully realized SS\n2010 collection.\nThe first rooms, titled London and\nSavage Mind, feature the beginning\nof McQueen\u2019s fashion career.\nDisplayed are several of McQueen\u2019s\nearly works from Saville Row which\nshow his innovative techniques yet\nprecision and mastery of tailoring,\nas well as the silhouettes particular\nto McQueen which form the basis\nof his more radically complex and\nrevolutionary designs shown later in\nthe exhibition.\nA highlight are the pieces from\nMcQueen\u2019s controversial Highland\nRape (AW 95) collection, which\nreferenced McQueen\u2019s Scottish\nancestry, and marked the birth of the\niconic tartan and \u2018Bumster\u2019 trousers.\nMcQueen\u2019s early runways established\nhis reputation for the theatrical and\nthe shocking, but this is only a taste\nof what is to come.\nThe following room, Romantic\nGothic, is breathtaking not only\nin content, but also in design. The\ninterior and soundtracks of every\nroom are perfectly crafted to set\nthe ideal background for the theme\nand designs displayed, so that one\nfeels fully immersed in the dynamic\nworld being portrayed. The walls\nare transformed into gold-framed\nmirrors spotted with black specks,\nconveying an antique feeling. The\ndesign features of this room have a\nhistoric feel, such as black Victorian\nlace and silhouettes, with provocative\nmodern twists, such as fetishistic\nleather masks. The evident theme\nof contrast in these pieces is central\nto McQueen \u2013 his exploration of\nthe transformational power of\nfashion, how a design can be both\nbeautiful and disturbing, feminine\nand threatening. For example,\nthe black swan dress from the AW\n2009 collection displayed evokes\nMcQueen\u2019s continuous exploration of\nthe female body as metamorphic.\nThe theme of untamed nature\npresent throughout many of\nMcQueen\u2019s collections is further\nexplored in the next room \u2013\nRomantic Primitivism. The room\nitself is a dark cave made of human\nskulls and bones, with a glass egg-shaped \u201cpool\u201d at the top showing the\nunderwater film of a drowning girl\nin a torn chiffon dress which opened\nMcQueen\u2019s Irere SS 2003 runway.\nThis disturbingly beautiful habitat\nhouses McQueen\u2019s fascination with\nthe natural world. These pieces, for\nexample the iconic blazer from the\nAW 1997 collection with gazelle\nhorns twisting from its shoulders,\nevoke an animalistic sense of power\nand fear; an energy that McQueen felt\nwas also present in sex.\nThe following Romantic\nNationalism room shocked me\nwith its opulent and graceful red,\nwhite and gold royal themes \u2013 it\nclearly showed how diverse and\ndifferent McQueen\u2019s creations were.\nThe pieces are complimented with\nSwarovski crystal encrusted masks \u2013\ncharacteristically McQueen.\nCabinet of Curiosities, which\nfollows, is the heart of the exhibition.\nEntering the high ceiling gallery\nleft me speechless; more than\n120 garments and accessories are\ndisplayed here alongside 21 screens\nshowing McQueen\u2019s runways.\nEach piece displayed is more a work\nof art than an accessory. The pieces\ntranscend all constraints of fashion\ndesign and technical possibilities;\nfrom the use of unexpected materials\nto particularly unconventional\ndesigns, the pieces clearly push the\nboundaries of what is the defined\nnorm of an \u2018accessory\u2019. This room\nis a most impressive proof of how\nMcQueen\u2019s diverse collaborations\nhelped inspire and realise his full\nvision. Despite the clear fetishistic\nimplications of the pieces (McQueen\nhimself remarked \u201cI like the\naccessory for its sadomasochistic\naspect\u201d), I found none of the pieces\nshocking. In all of McQueen\u2019s\ndesigns, there is a profound aesthetic\nof finding beauty in the most\nshocking and unexpected of sources.\nIn the centre revolves a dress,\nwhich again establishes McQueen\u2019s\ncatwalks as a dramatic place that\nmade a statement and evoked\nemotion. It is the dress that was\nspray painted by two robotic guns\non the revolving model during the\nfinale of McQueen\u2019s SS99 to show\nthe creative process itself. Savage\nBeauty\u2019s recreation of this moment\npays homage to McQueen\u2019s ability to\nshock the fashion industry through\nhis unconventional ideas.\nThe next room is also tribute to the\ncompletely unpredictable originality\nof McQueen\u2019s designs and catwalks.\nIt is a recreation of McQueen\u2019s\nAW2006 show finale where Kate\nMoss appeared as a hologram floating\nabove the catwalk before vanishing.\nThe illusion was not done digitally,\nbut using a 19th\ncentury technique.\nThis was one of my favourite\nmoments in Savage Beauty \u2013 there is\nsomething indescribably poignant\nand melancholic in the rippling white\nsilk organza floating through space to\nthe classical symphony soundtrack.\nThis was a wonderful contrast to the\nother dark and aggressive pieces.\nIn Romantic Exoticism more of\nMcQueen\u2019s unexpected designs, of a\nmore fragile and sensual aesthetic,\nare displayed. These show McQueen\u2019s\ninspiration by eastern cultures\nand nature; they are versions of\na traditional kimono-like design\nwith a radical modern reworking.\nThese pieces were part of another\nof McQueen\u2019s catwalks with an\nelaborate narrative, where he staged\na chess game of \u2018East\u2019 vs. \u2018West\u2019,\ninspired by Harry Potter and the\nPhilosopher\u2019s Stone.\nRomantic Naturalism shows\nthe most enduring influence on\nMcQueen. McQueen\u2019s nature-inspired designs emphasised the\nephemeral quality of the world. For\nexample, displayed here is a dress\nthat was originally made of silk and\nreal flowers, which fell and withered\non the runway during the show as a\nprofound display of beauty among\ndeath and decay. Many aspects of\ndeath seemed to influence McQueen,\nranging from its presence in power\nand submission, to death\u2019s romantic\nmelancholy. As death is a subtle motif\nThe \u2018Platos Atlantis\u2019 gallery at Savage Beauty, the V&A Photo: The Victoria and Albert Museum, London\npresent throughout all of McQueen\u2019s\ncollections, it is reflected throughout\nSavage Beauty.\nPlato\u2019s Atlantis is the finale of\nSavage Beauty, and features pieces\nof McQueen\u2019s last fully realised\ncollection of the same name.\nAcclaimed McQueen\u2019s greatest\ntriumph, it was the first show to be\nlive streamed online, and followed\na dystopian narrative of human\ndevolution in order to survive\nunderwater. The mannequins wear\nfamous 30.5cm Armadillo boots\n(once worn by Lady Gaga). The way\nthe collection is displayed \u2013 on\nspecially created mannequins,\nbefore a large screen, and along\nthematic music, conveys a sense of\nnature morphing with technology.\nPlato\u2019s Atlantis displays McQueen\u2019s\nremarkable visions of modernising\nnature without taming it, of finding\nbeauty in the grotesque, and of the\nfuture of fashion.\nReluctantly exiting Savage\nBeauty, I was bid farewell to by\na quote of McQueen\u2019s which, I\nthink, encapsulates the spirit\nof the exhibition: \u201cI\u2019m going to\ntake you on journeys that you\u2019ve\nnever dreamed possible\u201d. Whilst\nexploring Savage Beauty, I felt I was\nexperiencing something that was\nless of a fashion exhibition, and more\nof a journey through another world\nof unimaginable creativity. The\ndiversity of McQueen\u2019s revolutionary\n\"One feels\nfully\nimmersed\nin the\ndynamic\nworld\nbeing\nportrayed.\"\n\"Kate Moss\nappeared as\na hologram\nfloating\nabove the\ncatwalk\nbefore\nvanishing.\"\n\"It was the\nfirst show\nto be live\nstreamed\nonline, and\nfollowed a\ndystopian\nnarrative\"\nMcQueen\u2019s achievements both as an\nartist and a designer. The last room of\nthe exhibition with McQueen\u2019s final\ncollection and what is considered to\nbe his \u2018magnum opus\u2019 draws to mind\nthe last lines of Gilbert\u2019s poem:\n\u201cI believe Icarus was not failing as\nhe fell, but just coming to the end of\nhis triumph\u201d. Ending the exhibition\nwith McQueen\u2019s greatest triumph\naffirms his undying legacy and in.\nMcQueen once said, \u201cI want to be\nthe purveyor of a certain silhouette\u2026\nso that when I\u2019m dead and gone\npeople will know that the twenty-first\ncentury was stated by Alexander\nMcQueen\u201d. Savage Beauty succeeds in\nproving that McQueen fully realised\nhis goal.\n\"Death is\na subtle\nmotif\npresent\nthroughout\nMcQueen\u2019s\ncollections\"\nwork conveys a sense that his mind\nwas almost superhuman; it belonged\nto another world both wildly ancient\nand futuristic all at once, a world\nwhere boundaries imposed by norms\nare replaced by infinite possibilities.\nThe publicity of McQueen\u2019s\ntragically premature death had\nunfortunately overpoweringly\ntainted the perception of his legacy\nfor many who came to regard it as a\nheartbreaking failure to his brand\nas a whole. When faced with this, a\nline from Jack Gilbert\u2019s poem comes\nto mind \u2013 \u201cEveryone forgets that\nIcarus also flew\u201d. To me, Savage\nBeauty draws a parallel between the\nview of Icarus in Gilbert\u2019s poem and\nMcQueen; it reminds the audience of\n\n"

Every culture has a different\nspin on carnival, but few know how\nto do it better than the Trinidadians\u2019\nannual Play Mas.\nWritten in 1974 by the Trinidadian\nplaywright Mustapha Matura, once\nreferred to as \u201cthe most perceptive\nand humane of black dramatists\nwriting in Britain\u201d, Play Mas is a\nsharp, witty and at times beautifully\npoignant script illustrating a touching\npicture of Trinidadian culture.\nFocussing on the years leading up\nto Trinidad\u2019s independence and the\nspirit of carnival, this revival might\nnot be as relevant now as it was forty\nyears ago, but it still hits home with\nits questions on political power and\nnational identity. Despite this, with\nthe direction of Paulette Randall\nleaving a lot to be desired, my pick\nfor March was little more than a lukewarm laugh.\nSet in Miss Gookool\u2019s tailor shop,\nthe first act details the relationship\nbetween her, her son Ramjohn and\ntheir assistant Samuel. Exploring\naspiration and inspiration, the sharp\ndialogue characterises the warmth of\nTrinidadian culture and touches on\nthe ideas which led to independence\nfrom the British. While little is done\nto directly develop a plot, the play\u2019s\ndistinct focus on the importance\nof carnival draws a parallel to the\npowerful undertone of identity.\nThe performance of Johann Myers\nas Ramjohn is exceptional. Subtle\nand enticing, Myers\u2019 dedication\nto his character and striking focus\nheightens both the drama and the\ncomedy of the piece. With the core\ncast completed by Melanie La Barrie\nas Miss Gookool and Seun Shote as\nSamuel, their performances bring\nthe most out of Matura\u2019s wildly\nentertaining dialogue. Unfortunately,\nthe supporting cast fail to live up to\ntheir counterparts.\nFrom what feels like misguided\ndirection, the supporting cast\u2019s\ndesperation in trying to squeeze\nanother laugh out of the audience\nsidelines the deeply serious\nundertone of the play. Added to Rob\nHeanley\u2019s irritatingly bad attempt\nat an American accent, Randall\u2019s\nproduction comes across as farcical.\nIt\u2019s certainly funny, but as a complete\nplay it doesn\u2019t work.\nPerformed in the round, The\nOrange Tree\u2019s signature space can do\nSamuel (Seun Shote), Chuck Reynolds (Rob Heanley), Ramjohn Gookool (Johann Myers) in Play Mas at the\nOrange Tree Theatre Photo: Robert Day\nMax Falkenberg is let down by the Orange Tree Theatre\u2019s play\nWill the real Wellington please stand up?\nThe aim of the National\nPortrait Gallery\u2019s latest\ncollection is, explains the\ncurator, to \u201cput Wellington\u2019s great\nreputation back on the map\u201d. This\nsomehow implies that it ever went\naway. The Duke of Wellington is such\na well known figure, carved both on\nthe national consciousness and on\nnumerous memorials, that it makes\nsuch an exhibition \u2013 Wellington:\nTriumphs, Politics, and Passions \u2013\nsomewhat redundant. Unless, that\nis, they can stage an exhibition that\nallows us to look at the Duke in a new\nlight.\nSadly, the National Portrait Gallery\ndoesn\u2019t manage this; instead, what\nwe get are the same pictures we are\nused to again and again. Marking out\nhis life through a series of portraits,\nWellington stares down at us in\nregalia in an early John Hoppner,\npensively gazes from a Goya, and\nconsiders his surroundings in a\nstudy by Sir Thomas Lawrence.\nThese portraits are interspersed with\nother artefacts, such as metalware\nemblazoned with his face, and plates\npainted with the battle of Waterloo \u2013\ncamp artefacts of high kitsch.\nSome things in the exhibition\ndo stand out; the diary of Edmund\nWheatley, for example, made during\nthe Peninsular War, in which he\nsets descriptions of his everyday\nlife with exquisite watercolours, is a\nhighlight. Elsewhere, a painting by\nJames Ward, entitled The Triumph\nof Arthur, shows Wellington as a\nnear-angel, surrounded by golden\nmythical figures. It is overblown,\ngaudy, horrific, tacky, and utterly\nmarvellous. If only there were more\nlike it in the exhibition, rather than\nthe status quo images we are so used to\nconsuming.\nUltimately, the main problem\nwith the exhibition is simply that\nit doesn\u2019t give us a proper insight\ninto what Wellington was like as a\nman. It comes close to this when, in\nthe later sections, we find out about\nhis close friendships, and see how\nhe was satirised by the newspapers\nof the day. Ultimately, it would be\ngreat to have more things like this,\nthat would allow us to see what the\nman was like behind the image. This\nwould truly allow us to get a measure\nof Wellington, not as an icon, but as a\nman instead. If the National Portrait\nGallery had chosen to do this, then\nperhaps the show would have been\nmore interesteing, but ultimately all\nwe have are a collection of portraits,\nfrom which Wellington stares out,\nwith cold, unblinking eyes.\nWellington: Triumphs, Politics, and\nPassions is on at the National Portrait\nGallery until 7th March. Entrance free.\nSwan Lake 30 years on: still magical?\nNatalia Osipova as Odette and Matthew Golding as Prince Siegfried. Photo: Alice Pennefather\nFred Fyles finds ROH\u2019s ballet in need of updating despite strong dancing\nThey say that familiarity breeds\ncontempt; if this is true, it\nwould be surprising to find\nanyone in the country who can still\nstand Swan Lake, a ballet classic that\nhas become so well known that it\nrisks becoming dusty. However, this\nis clearly not the case, judging by the\nturnout for the Royal Opera House\u2019s\nproduction, which filled the hall\nright up to the rafters. A revival of\nAnthony Dowell\u2019s 1987 production,\nthis version of Swan Lake aims to\nplace the choreography firmly back\nat the centre of the work; rather than\ntrying any fancy staging techniques,\nor technical gimmicks, the piece\nreturns to London on the strength of\nthe Royal Ballet Company\u2019s dancers.\nOn the whole, the production\nstands up well, despite being nearly\n30 years old; while this may not seem\nlike a long time when one considers\nthat Swan Lake has been repeatedly\nreinterpreted for the last century,\nin actual fact it can be difficult to\nproduce a ballet that truly stands\nthe test of time. In this version,\nthe longevity is guaranteed by the\nexcellent choreography, based upon\nthe 1895 version by Marius Petipa\nand Lev Ivanov; the movements\nare tight and organised, the dancers\nclearly drilled like an army platoon,\nbut there is a generosity in the\nmovements, and a light grace that\nbelies the hours of sweat that goes\ninto such a performance.\nThe dual role of Odette/Odile, one\nof those characters who has gone\ndown in ballet history for the sheer\ndifficulty of interpretation, is filled\nby Natalia Osipova, principle of the\nRoyal Ballet. Osipova is good in the\nrole, particularly when filling the part\nof Odette, the White Swan, conveying\nan emotional vulnerability whilst\nnever letting the human side of the\ncharacter get consumed. While it\ncan be easy for a dancer to play up to\nthe swan role, all quivering legs and\nshaking arms, Osipova imbues her\ncharacter with womanliness, meaning\nthat Prince Siegfried\u2019s (Matthew\nGolding) obsession with Odette comes\nacross as romantic, as opposed to\nsome form of strange bestiality.\nThe chemistry between Osipova\nand Golding is apparent from\ntheir first encounter, making their\npartnership on stage something really\nspecial. The relationship between the\nprincipal dancers is what can make\nor break a version of Swan Lake, and\nin this production the two leads have\na strong base upon which the rest of\nthe piece is built. Golding also imbues\nhis Prince with a sense of muscular\nphysicality, meaning Siegfried\u2019s\nmovements have a character all of\ntheir own, as opposed to simply being\nFRED FYLES\nSECTION EDITOR\n\"It\u2019s\ncertainly\nfunny,\nbut as a\ncomplete\nplay it\ndoesn\u2019t\nquite work\"\n\"Play Mas\nis a sharp,\nwitty, and\nat times\nbeautifully\npoignant\nscript\"\n\"The\nchemistry\nbetween\nObraztsova\nand McRae\nis apparent\nfrom\ntheir first\nencounter\"\nwonders for a show as easily as it can\nbreak a show. Although the staging\ndoesn\u2019t fail the space completely, a\ndegree of poor blocking leaves parts\nof the audience wondering why they\nare only seeing certain actors from\nbehind.\nWhile the problem isn\u2019t\nparticularly pervasive, the oddly long\nscene changes make the production\nfeel distinctly disjointed. It is a\nshame really because the script offers\nan excitingly upbeat tempo, but\ntoo often little details are pushed\ntoo far at the expense of the play\u2019s\nclarity. With a little more focus on\nthe serious moments and a little\nless forcefulness with the comedy, I\nimagine this revival\u2019s shortcomings\ncould have been easily resolved.\nDespite its faults, Play Mas still\noffers an impressive two hours of\nentertainment. With Samuel rising to\npolitical power in the second half, it is\nrefreshing to think that occasionally\neven politics can be funny. With\nblack theatre so underrepresented,\nRandall does throw in a few moments\nof genius, giving The Orange Tree\u2019s\ndistinctly middle-class audience an\nenjoyable snapshot of Caribbean\nculture. Overall though, Play Mas\nwasn\u2019t quite what it was made out to\nbe.\nPlay Mas is on at the Orange Tree\nTheatre until 11th\nApril. Tickets from\n\u00a310\n\"The real\nmagic\nhappens\nwhen the\nfocus is\ndirected\ntowards the\ncorps de\nballet\u201d\na backdrop for the main action.\nUnfortunately, Osipova is not\nas good as the Black Swan, lacking\nthe required sensuality needed to\nbring the role to life. The diametric\nopposite of Odette, playing Odile,\nthe daughter of evil sorcerer Von\nRothbart (played by Gary Avis, all\nfeathers and moult), requires the\ndancer to be able to reverse their\ninitial approach \u2013 confident where\nOdette was fragile, red-hot where the\nWhite Swan is icy. Osipova is clearly\nmore confident when playing the\nBlack Swan, but her attempts to be\nseductive sadly fall flat.\nThe real magic, however, happens\nwhen the focus is taken off the\nmain dancers, and instead directed\ntowards the corps de ballet, who form\nthe backbone of the production. The\ngroup in Swan Lake are magnificent\n\u2013 well drilled, with their en pointe\non point. A case in point, the \u2018Danse\ndes petits cygnes\u2019, in which four of\nthe dancers link hands and perform\na series of increasingly complex\nmoves, is perfectly done, with the\nswans appearing to glide across ice.\nIn other scenes, they hold their poise\nwell, but it is the swan scenes where\nthe dynamics of the cast really sing\nout, and the women seem to be nearly\nturning into swans before our eyes.\nSadly, while the choreography is\na high point, other aspects have not\nfared well. The staging veers between\nsimple minimalism and complex\ngothic piles, with the former being\nmuch more engaging to the audience;\nin the lake scenes, all that is present\nis an icy backdrop, shrouded in\nmist, while in the ballroom scenes,\nit appears that designer Yolanda\nSonnabend has ransacked the Palace\nof Versailles, bringing with her a\nsuperfluity of chintz. These sets,\nalong with some of the costumes\nreveal the production\u2019s true age, and\nseem to drag behind the slick moves\nof the dancers.\nAt this point, I feel that I should\nadmit that I didn\u2019t actually see\nthis production in the Royal Opera\nHouse\u2019s cavernous main ampitheatre,\nbut rather in a central London\ncinema, as part of ROH Live, in\nwhich the company broadcasts a\nlive screening of the performance\nacross the country. While this\nis undoubtedly a good means of\nensuring that everyone who wants\ncan share in the magic of ballet, from\nSkegness to Slough, there are certain\nelements that make it somewhat\nmore challenging from actually\nseeing it live; there\u2019s a different\natmosphere, of course, not seeing\nthe dancers in the flesh; but also,\nthe location of the microphones\nmeans that the dancers\u2019 footsteps are\nemalified to such an extent that \u2013 at\ntimes \u2013 they rise above the orchesta\u2019s\nbeautiful music\nI have no doubt that this version of\nSwan Lake will be a \u2018classic\u2019 of ballet,\nwith its bold, generous choreography,\nand only needs a great pairing \u2013 such\nas we have here \u2013 to propel it into\ngreatness. Although Osipova has\nproblems with the dual role, the\nchemistry between her and McRae\nmore than makes up for this. With a\nthirty year history, this production\nseems to have fared well so far, but\nhow long will it be before it really\nbeings to feel tired? \u2013 if the sets\nand costumes are not updated and\ntrimmed down, this day may come\nsooner than you think.\nSwan Lake is on at the Royal Opera\nHouse until 9th\nApril 2015. Tickets\nare available online; for sold out\nperformances, day tickets will also be\navailable.\nSwan Lake is being broadcast to\ncinemas across the country as part\nof ROH Live. The next screening\nwill be on 22nd\nMarch, for which the\nparticipating cinemas will be running\na Student Standby scheme, allowing\nthose with valid student ID to\npurchase two tickets for \u00a310.

Photo: BBC\nGiulia Gabrielli reviews season 4 of the tearjerking BBC show\nAttenborough\u2019s swan song\nLifeStory takes us around the world to see an eclectic\ncollection of animal behaviours in the journey through\nlife on this planet. Quirky and fascinating scenes from\nbirth and growing up, through the struggle to create\na home and establish power, and finally mating and\npassing genes on to the next generation. The latest BBC\nnature show is perhaps not as remote, spectacular or\nhuman-like as other previous Attenborough ventures.\nBut then it hits you: his swan song is not about majestic\ntime-lapse shots and peculiar behaviours, even though\nit is filled with such moments.\nWhen you see the tribulations of a young hermit\ncrab\u2019s struggle to get into the property ladder, a lonely\noctopus looking for protection, or the exquisite and\nhypnotising sand-sculpture a Japanese puffer-fish\nbuilds in order to attract a lady you suddenly realise\nthat the human struggle for survival and existence is\nneither more nor less meaningful than that of any other\nspecies.\nI had my epiphany yesterday as I watched two\nalbatrosses re-encounter after a year apart while flying\naround the world. Are the bonds we have with our kin\nmore significant than theirs?\nIs our impossible search for an affordable semi-detached three-bedroom house in London\u2019s zone 3 as\nunnerving as Mr. Crabby\u2019s competitive housing chain?\nOr do we selfishly put ourselves at the centre of this\nuniverse so we can fill the void the acknowledgement of\nthe insignificance of our existence leaves behind?\nOnly when we, as a species, stop trying to find some\nspecial meaning to our being can we finally embrace our\nposition as part of nature, protect it and revel in awe at\nits magnificence and our ability to perceive it.\nDIOGO MIGUEL GERARDES\n\"The vibes\nchange\nfrom the\nausterity\nof the\n50s to the\ncolours of\nthe 60s.\"\nIn four years I have never\nwatched an episode of Call the\nMidwife without crying. And I\nnever cry. There\u2019s just something\nabout the tragic and sweet stories of\npost-war London that fills me with\nwarmth and makes me want to call\nmy granny.\nI was sceptical after the departure\nof Nurse Jenny Lee, narrator and\nmain character, that the writers\nwere going to be able to maintain\na strong plotline following the loss\nof Poplar\u2019s most beloved midwife.\nAfter all, the series was based on\nJennifer Worth\u2019s (real-life Jenny\nLee) own memoirs.\nBut BBC proved me wrong, as it so\noften does. Replacing the romance\nand gossip of Worth\u2019s characters\nwith serious themes and stories\ntaken from historical testimonies\nThe deeper, darker content is\ndefinitely appreciated, and feels\nlike a spontaneous development as\nthe vibe changes from the austerity\nof the 50s to the colour and\ninnovation of the 60s.\nAlthough, one thing still bugs\nme: why is elderly Nurse Lee still\nnarrating the stories since she is\nnot in them anymore? I guess the\nproduction wants to keep showing\nVanessa Redgrave\u2019s name of the\nscreen to gain golden stars.\nNevertheless, the joint effort is\nstill impressive, and some of the\ncharacter developments showed\nby the secondary characters really\nshow what a great cast was chosen\nfor this show.\nOf the original cast, Miranda\nHart\u2019s character, Chummie, is seen\nas a more mature and motherly\nfigure. Having grown out of her\nsilly and clumsy character she\nis now a competent nurse with a\nloving husband and chubby baby.\nWhen asked to take over a mother-and-child home she rises to the\nchallenge, finally proving her\nworth for good.\nNurse Cynthia, who always\nseemed more quite and poised, is\nnow seen going through a spiritual\ncrisis. This leads her to join the\norder as a nun, something which\nprofoundly changes the other girls.\nPatsy, a relatively new character,\ndevelops a strong friendship with\nanother female nurse. Quickly the\nviewer perceives that the friendship\nhas developed into a romantic\nrelationship, the first mention of\nhomosexuality in Nonnatus house.\nBut maybe the biggest shock of\nthe season is the development of\nHelen George\u2019s character, Nurse\nTrixie. When we left Trixie, she was\nthe blond and superficial girl of the\ngroup. Always up for a gossip over\na shiny magazine, she was about to\nmarry the man of her dreams: blue-eyed Reverend Tom Hereward.\nIn this series, we see Trixie\nfinding herself while exploring\nher dark past. After the grave\nrealisation that she, as her abusive\nfather, is an alcoholic, she takes\nthe bold decision of annulling her\nengagement in order to work on her\nproblems.\nThe show focus on her role as\npart of the Nonnatus midwives,\nmore marginal but still key to\nthe dynamics of the group, shows\ngreat performances from all cast\nmembers, forced to show empathy\nand anger for Trixie. In particular,\nit is refreshing to see her changing\nrelationship with Cynthia after her\ndecision to become a nun.\nNew additions to the cast\ninclude Linda Bassett, who plays\nNurse Crane, an unmarried\nillegitimate child who tries to fit\nin and Charlotte Ritchie, from the\nuniversity student series Fresh Meat.\nThe most important part of\nthe show though, are the women\ngiving birth episode after episode.\nThey tell stories of overbearing\nparents, violent husbands, poverty,\nprostitution, immigration and\ndiscrimination.\nCall the Midwife, once a curious\ntale of what England used to be\nafter the difficulties of the war, has\nmorphed into a cutting portrayal\nof the changes faced by London\u2019s\nsociety in the 1960s.\nIf once, it was the tragedy of the\nnurses\u2019 personal relationships\nthat made me pull out the tissues,\nnow it is the battle of the traveller\ncommunity to fit into Poplar, the\nstruggle of a lesbian couple to spend\nthe rest of their lives together or the\ntorments of alcoholism.\nSomething that has not changed\nthough, is the intimacy and\nsubtlety of the writing, which\ncontinue to make this show a\nbrilliant watch.\nA love crop-circle made by a Japanese puffer-fish.

A state of emergency was\ndeclared in the country last Thursday\n11th\nMarch after the region was\ndevastated by Cyclone Pam in\npossibly the greatest natural disaster\nin the nation\u2019s history.\nRachel Brooks, a 27 year old PhD\ncandidate at Imperial, raised \u00a313,000\nin donations in less than a week for\nthe islands of Tanbok and Pentecost\nwhilst still recovering from surgery\non her arm.\nShe first founded the Tanbok\nProject in 2007 after spending a gap\nyear teaching maths and physics A\nlevel to children in remote parts of\nthe country. \u201cThe community did a\nlot for me so I wanted to do a lot for\nthe community,\u201d she stated.\nRachel managed to raise around\n\u00a312,000 to build a new library at the\nschool where she taught during her\nstay on the island. The money was\nraised through sponsored bike rides\nand half marathons.\nSadly the library construction\nplans must now be put on hold as the\ncyclone has apparently devastated\nthe school site. Rachel hopes that\nthe funds can be redirected into\nrebuilding the school.\n\u201cBasically the project got started\nbefore the Cyclone hit \u2013 we\u2019d just\nbeen trying to support the school.\nWe\u2019d set up all of our \u2026 building\ncommittees and communication\nnetworks and then the cyclone came\nand destroyed everything.\n\u201cWe decided that the school\u2019s not\ngoing to be needing a library any time\nsoon, the school\u2019s probably going to\nbe needing a school \u2013 so we\u2019ve put\nthat on hold and decided to basically\nuse the network we\u2019ve already created\nto do some fundraising for the relief\neffort\u201d.\nCyclone Pam made land contact\nwith Vanuatu last week and caused\nwidespread damage. 90% of the\nbuildings in Vanuatu are understood\nto have been affected by the storm.\nIt is believed that the majority\nof islanders have been displaced\nfrom their homes and huge tracts of\nfarmland have been wiped out. Up\nto 80% of the population engages in\nsubsistence agriculture as a primary\neconomic activity.\nOrganisations such as the Vanuatu\nRed Cross, UNICEF Pacific and\nAustralian Oxfam have launched\ndisaster relief campaigns, and\na number of governments have\ndeclared aid.\nRachel explained her plans for\nthe money raised by the Tanbok\nProject, including the funds collected\npreviously for the school library:\n\u201cThe money that\u2019s been coming in\nsince Saturday night will be going\nspecifically to hurricane repairs\nelsewhere on the island.\n\u201cThe money that\u2019s raised already,\npeople donated that money believing\nthat they were donating for this\nlibrary for the school. So either way,\nthat money will be reserved for that\nschool\u201d.\nShe also revealed plans to arrange\npartnerships between schools in the\nUK and Vanuatu. \u201cThe longer-term\nplan is to get schools [here] to support\nschools out there \u2026 to pair them up\nand say this is your partner school\nthat\u2019s had a roof blown off, and have\nthem run events\u201d.\nThe Tanbok Project hopes to use\ntheir connections in the region to\nreach overlooked, remote areas of\nPentecost and Tanbok that larger aid\norganisations may struggle to reach.\nThey are seeking to provide\nclothing and food supplies, water\ntanks, tools and fuel to transport\nmaterials around the islands.

He allegedly told\nthe girls he was fed up with dealing\nwith drunken students, and didn\u2019t\nhave time to resolve their transport\nissues.\nAfter the girls confronted him\nover his bad attitude, he proceeded\nto storm off and leave them alone\noutside of the Stoop, telling them as\nhe left to make their own way home.\nThe girls then told Felix that a\nsecurity guard approached them\nafter, asking if they were ok and if\nthey knew how to get home. The\nsecurity guard then radioed allegedly\nthe same member of staff, to which he\nwas heard to respond over the walkie-talkie: \u201cI don\u2019t care how those fat girls\nget home\u201d.\nThe girls were eventually taken\nback to South Kensington by another\nSports Imperial staff member later in\nthe evening.\nTransport to the Stoop earlier in the\nday was also poorly organised: one\ndouble decker coach travelling from\nthe South Kensington campus only\nhad eight people inside, despite the\nwomen\u2019s rugby girls having to make\ntheir own way there.\nThe girls turned up at\nHammersmith Apollo at 5pm to\nmeet a coach that also didn\u2019t show\nup, despite multiple reassurances\nfrom Sport Imperial staff that a coach\nwould meet them there and that they\nhad also paid for it.\nThe girls therefore ordered taxis\nto take them to the Stoop, based\nin South West London, and only\narrived shortly before the men\u2019s\ngame began. Several students called\nthe organisation of transportation a\n\u201cshambles\u201d.\nUp to four coaches left the Stoop\nearly and completely empty once they\ndropped students off, due to damage\nto their interior sustained during the\njourney there.\nThere was therefore a shortage of\ncoaches available to take students\nback to central London, which led\nto people panicking over how they\nwere getting home and prematurely\nqueuing outside the stadium in a bid\nto leave as soon as possible \u2013during\nthe women\u2019s game.\nThe women\u2019s rugby match, touted\nas the \u201cheadline act\u201d of Varsity\n2015 by Neil Mosley, head of Sport\nImperial, lasted forty minutes in\ntotal.\nIt was followed by a lacklustre\nawards ceremony, where IC was\ncrowned overall winners of Varsity,\nalthough only staff from College,\nthe rugby teams and a handful of\nstudents who had stayed behind were\npresent.\nSport Imperial also promised\nthe women\u2019s rugby team would be\nprovided with dinner and drinks\nafter the match along with the men\u2019s\nrugby team. However, by the end\nof the women\u2019s match the men had\nalready been fed, been asked to leave\nthe dining facilities and had left the\nStoop. When the girls arrived most of\nthe food had already been eaten and\nthe remaining food was cold.\nMona Theodoraki, the Captain of\nthe Women Rubgy Club told Felix:\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the way that things\nturned out. We played an amazing\nmatch and both teams worked so hard\nand it\u2019s a shame that not many people\ngot to see it.\n\u201cHopefully we will be given this\nopportunity again in the future to\nshow everyone what we can do\u201d.\nTheodoraki has since issued an\nemail to Sport Imperial detailing\nall of these events, and requesting\na public apology. In it she stated:\n\u201cYesterday highlighted the sexism\nthat is unfortunately very present at\nImperial.\n\u201cAs female rugby players, we have\nto fight to rebrand rugby as not just a\n\u2018man\u2019s game\u2019, and this poor treatment\nhas set us back massively. With the\nstands being emptied at halftime, the\nmessage that got sent across was that\nwomen are not as important as men\u201d.\nThe email has also been sent to\nAlice Gast, the President of Imperial\nCollege and Debra Humphris, the\nVice Provost (Education) and a\nfan of the club as a whole; in the\nVarsity programme she wrote an\nintroduction to the team, stating\nthat \u201cI am particularly pleased that\nthe leading rugby event this year will\nfeature the women of the College,\nrecognising just how far the women\u2019s\ngame in the UK has progressed\u201d.\nNeil Mosley has since offered to\nmeet up to discuss the allegations in\nperson with the team.\nA spokesperson from Sport\nImperial explained that the\nunplanned departure of the coaches\nwas outside their control: \u201cAll the\ncoaches were booked to leave the\nStoop at 9:45pm, after the end of the\nheadline game.\n\u201cFollowing the build-up of a crowd\naround the exit to the stadium\nduring the final match it appears that\nStadium staff decided to announce\nthat coaches were leaving in an effort\nto disperse the crowd.\n\u201cThis was done without\nconsultation with any College staff\nand will be investigated\u201d. They\nconcluded: \u201cAny rude or aggressive\nbehaviour towards athletes, students\nor guests is completely unacceptable.\n\u201cAny complaints will be taken\nseriously and investigated in line with\nCollege procedures. If any allegation\nrelates to a member of Stadium staff\nwe will ensure the matter is raised\nwith senior managers there\u201d.\nThey added that they will be\noffering a refund to students who\nmissed out on transport because one\nof the coaches missed a scheduled\nstop, and will be looking into why the\nwomen\u2019s coaches never materialised.\nSport Imerial head Neil Mosley\ntold Felix: \u201cThe women\u2019s rugby teams\ncapped 2015\u2019s Varsity with a great\ngame, a high-note to end on in line\nwith the quality of competition across\nthis year\u2019s sports.\n\u201cThe evening was built around\nwomen\u2019s rugby as the centrepiece\nevent, with everything timed to\nencourage people to see the end of the\ngame and the presentations.\n\u201cWe\u2019re deeply disappointed that\nthe early coach departures meant this\nwasn\u2019t the case. We\u2019re liaising with\nthe coach company and stadium staff\nto establish exactly what happened.\n\u201cEveryone involved in sport at\nImperial knows that players and\nsupporters deserve better than this\nand we\u2019re sorry that the problems\npeople encountered meant that the\noccasion didn\u2019t live up to the quality\nof sport on the field\u201d.\nThe crowd was vociferous during the Men\u2019s fixture, but left rapidly during the Women\u2019s headline game Photo: Ben Lester ThroughBensLens.co.uk\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 47\n20.03.2015\nFELIX\n46 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n20.03.2015\nKunal Wagle reports from the Stoop as the 1st XV win 32-10\nLate tries add gloss to College victory\nTwo dominant periods at the\nstart and end of the match\nensured that Imperial College\nclaimed a more than comfortable\nvictory over the Imperial Medicals\nat The Stoop on Wednesday. Having\nscored an early penalty, the College\nthen put away two unanswered tries\nbefore the Medics hit back to give\nthemselves a chance at 15-5 at half-time. Another try two minutes into\nthe second half for the boys in red\nhad the College worried. But their\noverall superiority shone through in\nthe end as they went over three more\ntimes before the end of the game to\nunderline their great performance,\nthough the Medics may feel slightly\naggrieved that the final score looked\nso one sided after an encouraging\nperformance.\nAfter a 39-5 drubbing just two\nweeks ago the Medics would have\nbeen hoping for a fast start, but they\nhad anything but. They were initially\nill disciplined in their own half, and\non the third time they were punished\nwith College captain James Cox\nslotting over with a fairly straight\nkick 25 yards out from the try line.\nThe Medics did threaten after\nthat, but often their moves were\nscuppered by either ill-advised or\nmisguided offloads. In the end they\nwere punished by the College, who\nwere rewarded for an excellent\nmove, starting with a break from\nthe halfway line, with a try from\ncentre Sam Moorby. Cox kicked the\nconversion.\nCollege advanced dangerously\nalmost straight from the kick off,\nonly to throw it away with a knock\non on the 5 metre line. If the Medics\nbreathed a sigh of relief at that\nmoment, it was shortlived. College\nwere in a destructive mood, and\nweren\u2019t going to be stopped. A driving\nmaul just two minutes later did go\nover the line. Despite Cox missing\nthe conversion, the scoreline was\nbeginning to look very bleak for the\nMedics at 15-0.\nWith the game already almost\nout of sight, the Medics launched\na spirited comeback. Having been\ncamped out within five metres of\nthe College try line for almost three\nminutes, stand in captain Vernon\nMcGeoch went over to get the medics\non the board on the half-hour mark.\nAgain, the conversion was missed, but\nat half-time, the medics were still in\nthe game.\nWhat had been a fairly one sided\ngame until half-time became a lot\ncloser after the break as the Medics\nended a driving move by breaching\nthe College defence and making\nthe score (after the conversion was\nmissed) 15-10.\nHowever the Medics, for all\ntheir effort, just couldn\u2019t keep the\nmomentum up. After a prolonged\nperiod of play without much action\nbeyond either side\u2019s 22 yard line, the\nCollege managed to break through\nthe defence and a large break away\nresulted in their third try of the night,\npushing the gap to 12 points with just\ntwenty minutes to go.\nThe Medics continued to push, but\na series of penalties on the five metre\nline resulted to nothing, pretty much\nsumming up their night. The game\nwas in danger of petering out but the\nCollege came to the rescue, adding\nadditional excitement at the end of\nthe game. In the last four minutes the\nCollege ran through the tired Medics,\nadding two more tries close to the end\nof the game to finish off the game\nwith a resounding 32-10 win. A cynic\nmight say that these tries added gloss\nto the score, but in reality it showed\nthe true gulf in performance of the\ntwo teams on the night itself.\nMan of the match was awarded\nto the College centre Sam Moorby,\nwhose strong performance proved\none of the major difference. He\nscored two tries as well, making him\na worthy winner of the award, despite\ncaptain James Cox also having a\nstorming game.\nSpeaking to Felix after the game,\nACC Chair and Rugby Honorary\nSecretary Oli Benton said of the\nwin \u201cWhile the lead up to this years\nVarsity has been less than ideal, the\nperformance on the night put all\nthose worries to bed. Building off\nthe back of a comprehensive beating\nof the Medics a couple of weeks ago,\nIC brought their positive attacking\nrugby back to the Stoop. With\nthe customary high levels of sand\nensuring the pitch wasn\u2019t boggy, the\nCollege backs played aggressively\nbehind a solid platform provided by\nthe forwards. Particular mentions\nmust go to the scrum half Durkin,\nwho was always a threat, the flyhalf\nand captain Cox, who marshalled\nthe game with customary aplomb\nand Moorby who brought his usual\nphysicality with some excellent hard\nrunning and support lines.\u201d\nThe first match saw the College convincingly beat the Medics 32-10 Photo: Ben Lester, throughbenslens.co.uk\nPhoto: Ben Lester, throughbenslens.co.uk\nKunal Wagle is on hand at the Stoop as College win women\u2019s match\nLate resurgence not enough for Medics\nAlate resurgence from the\nImperial Medicals was not\nenough to prevent a victory\nfor the Imperial College team in the\nfirst ever Varsity fixture held at The\nStoop for women\u2019s rugby. It was a\nlow scoring game of ten-a-side rugby\nthat was decided on a few beautiful\nbreakaway tries. For long periods\nof the game it looked as though the\nCollege could score at any moment.\nBut, having gone two tries down\nbefore half time, the Medics rallied\nafter the break, and a last gasp try\nended the game at a close 15-12.\nHowever, the Medics could point to\na couple of dubious decisions in the\nlead up to two of the tries that College\nscored.\nIt was a cagey opening as both\nsides appeared nervous on their\nfirst appearance at the stadium. The\nCollege grabbed the early initiative\nand appeared permanently camped\ninside the Medics 5 metre line for\nnearly five minutes, followed by a\nbig dash to the line. The move would\ncome to nothing however, as the ball\nwas turned over to the medics, the\nfirst of many turnovers in a scrappy\ngame. The medics then broke away\n(another common feature in the\ngame) but were eventually penalised\non the halfway line for holding on.\nIt looked as though it would take\na moment of brilliance to break\nthe deadlock and the College duly\ndelivered. Having turned the ball over\non their own 22 the ball was chipped\nover the Medics and duly collected\nby College. After a massive seventy\nyard break the College eventually\nwent over the line after a few phases\nto send their bench into raptures.\nThe conversion was missed but the\ndeadlock had been broken. It was 5-0.\nBut it wouldn\u2019t stay 5-0 for long.\nStraight from the kick off the College\nwere back on the attack, and this\ntime they would receive instant\nreward as a couple of smart offloads\nled to a College try under the posts.\nThe try again wasn\u2019t converted,\nbut the College went into halftime\nimmediately afterwards already\nlooking too far beyond the Medics\nside.\nThere would have been some who\nwere worried about whether the\nmedics could make a comeback in\nthe second half, but their fears would\nprove to be unfounded as the medics\nstarted the second half strongly. A\nperiod of possession just after the\nrestart didn\u2019t lead to anything, but it\nwould eventually be them who struck\nfirst blood in the second half.\nIt took nearly eleven minutes, but\nthrough that period the medics were\ncomfortably the better team, rarely\nventuring into their own half. But\nonce they reached within 10 metres\nof the College try line there was no\nstopping them. They went over after\nthree or four phases, thus pulling the\ngame back to 10-5 with it all to play\nfor in the last ten minutes.\nAll the Medics hard work would\nbe undone just a few minutes later\nafter the College completed a good\nmove on the 22 line with a break to\nthe try line. But it seemed harsh on\nthe medics, as tv footage strongly\nsuggested that there was a knock on\nand offside in the build up, which\nshould have resulted in a penalty\nto the medics. The medics will feel\nhard done by when combining this\nwith the first try, which had a hint of\noffside when the chip went through.\nThe controversial try would prove\nto be a knockout blow to the medics,\nalthough they fought valiantly until\nthe last, going over for a consolation\ntry at the very end of the game.\nDeserved MVP was the Medics fly-half Katherine Fok, who then kicked\nthe only conversion of the game to\nleave the final score 15-12.\nWinning College captain Alice\nLiberman said \u201cWe had great fun\nplaying our varsity match. The game\nwas fairly even and a good challenge\nboth teams could learn from. We very\nmuch appreciated the opportunity\nto play at the stoop and would like to\nthank all the supporters who cheered\nus on!\u201d.\nElisabeth Robinson, captain of the\nMedics team said \u201cAs a team we were\nvery pleased with our performance\ndespite losing. In the first half our\ndefence was relentless, three held up\ntries later and IC still didn\u2019t score. If\nit hadn\u2019t been a cheeky IC break, final\nscores may\u2019ve been different.\n\u201cIn the second half we dominated,\nrarely venturing into the ICSM half\nand bringing the score back up to a\nrespectable 15-12.\n\u201cKeeping the pressure up was\ngruelling, especially as IC had lots\nof subs. But we had an epic time and\ncan be proud of a game of rugby well\nplayed.\u201d\nThe College scored two of their tries with big breaks from near the halfway line Photo: Ben Lester, throughbenslens.co.uk\nMVP Katherine Fok was indispensable with the boot for the Medics Photo: Ben Lester, throughbenslens.co.uk\n\n"

The wonderful boys and girls in the Marketing Department did a\nstellar job this year - I couldn\u2019t go anywhere without seeing one of their\ndelightful posters, while the official match programme was a treat.\nParticular congratulations must go to those responsible for arranging\nsponsorship of the event - despite the financial losses incurred by\ncertain members of the faculty being unable to contain their excitement\n(amongst other bodily fluids) on the coach, the sponsorship totals raised\nwere so vast that all losses were incurred by our sponsors, not us.

Or is it just me?. Photo: glastonburyfestival.\nco.uk\nGrace Rahman says headliners needn\u2019t be white men with guitars\nNot such a Modest Mouse\nDIOGO GERALDES\nMUSIC WRITER\nEarlier this week, rumours\nwere rife that Kanye West,\nhaving established himself as\na true anglophile following a BRIT\nperformance and a secret show at\nKOKO in the last month, was going\nto announce that he was headlining\nGlastonbury.\nInstead, he posted loads of photos of\nhis naked wife, in celebration of her\nreaching 30 million Twitter followers.\nIt\u2019s always nice when you get a few\nlikes on your profile pic, but this was\nhardly the announcement music fans\nwere waiting for. On Monday night,\nEmily Eavis, daughter of 80-year-old\nMichael who started the Somerset\nfestival, announced that Yeezy would\nindeed be headlining the Pyramid\nstage on Saturday night.\nHoorah, loads of people thought\nand tweeted. We are so beyond that\npoint in 2008 where tickets for\nGlasto didn\u2019t sell out instantly when\nJay Z was announced. Organisers\nmaintained that this was because of\nconsistently bad weather over the last\ncouple of festivals, rather than regular\nattendees not liking the idea of a hip\nhop headliner. Since then we\u2019ve had\nColdplay and Beyonc\u00e9.\nWe\u2019ve come along way. Man of the\npeople Noel Gallagher, who hasn\u2019t\nproduced anything relevant since the\nyear 2000, told the press that booking\nJay was just \u201cwrong\u201d. Eventually\ntickets did sell out and Greenpeace\ngot their couple of million quid,\nwhich had been adorable organiser,\nMichael Eavis\u2019 only big worry.\nIncidentally, Jay drew a humungous\ncrowd, as all headliners do, opened\nwith \u2018Wonderwall\u2019 and smashed it. He\nplayed up to the haters with humour\nand the best tool possible, a fantastic\nperformance.\nNoel\u2019s argument was that\nGlastonbury wasn\u2019t \u201cbroke, so\nwhy fix it\u201d. No Noel, Glastonbury\nisn\u2019t broken, despite having been\ndesperate enough to get Oasis to\nheadline for a second time in 2004.\nIts formula of having three world-dominators play the evenings and\nbasically anyone you\u2019ve heard of\nwithin the last year the rest of the\ntime probably won\u2019t break for a while\nyet. I\u2019m yet to meet anyone who\u2019s\never liked all three headliners more\nthan once.\nYou enter a sort of agreement on\nthat dreaded morning in October\nwhen tickets first go on sale. Usually,\nno one has been announced yet. The\norganisers are still recovering and\nthere are too many Red Stripe cans\nand tent pegs left from that year\u2019s\nfestival to let the cows back yet, but\nyou trust in the organisers with\nthat fifty quid deposit, and assume\nthat, like every year, there\u2019ll be so\nmany good bands playing that you\u2019ll\ninevitably kick yourself for missing\nsome of them.\nWas I the only person who didn\u2019t\nreally fancy seeing Metallica last\nyear? Probably not. But I didn\u2019t bitch\nand whine and make a change.org\npetition about it as though if we got\nenough signatures someone would\ntake it to Downing Street. When we\nwent to print, this actual petition,\nthat really exists, had racked up\n43,000 signatures. I\u2019m not saying you\ncan\u2019t hate Kanye West. Love or loathe\nhis back catalogue or latest offering,\nthe man is undoubtably a bit of a mug\nand has often shown a bad attitude.\nHe sure as hell won\u2019t be spotted\nsneaking into a secret James Blake\nshow at the Park Stage. Like Shirley\nBassey before him, he\u2019ll be promptly\nhelicoptered to safety before Kim\u2019s\nHunters can touch the ground. It\u2019s\nokay not to like bands. In all honesty,\nI was sceptical when they booked\nDolly Parton last year. But oh my,\nmust we pretend that that if we get\nenough twirps to sign and tweet that\nthis will ever get changed?\nAre you honestly telling me that\nnone of those 43,000 people would\nbe embarassingly miming along to\nmost of Gold Digger on that Saturday\nLike the slow unwrapping of a\npresent shaped exactly like what\nyou asked for, you already know\nwhat\u2019s inside and you can savour\nevery second of its discovery. Starting\nwith the song that named the album\n(or was it the album that named the\nsong?), we are slowly eased back into\nIsaac Brock\u2019s stabbing vocals, cutting\nthrough instrumental sheets that\nwrap us in a cocoon of self-reflection,\nModest Mouse style. It feels like our\nears have gone through a decade-long\ncreative desert and now need to be\nretrained on what years of evolution\nperfected them for: the distilling\nof subtle pressure waves into the\nharmonic vibrations that make our\ncore shudder.\nNow that we are tuned in to the\nright frequency and introductions\nare over, \u2018Lampshades of Fire\u2019\nexplodes all over your face like a\nspring-loaded box. Suddenly we are\ncelebrating human destruction of\nthe world, told to pack up again and\nfind another planet to burn and chop\ndown. Wait, what? Never mind. The\nslow, introspective, \u2018Shit in Your\nCut\u2019 is already evolving into an\nepic crescendo to prelude \u2018Pistol (A.\nCunaman, Miami, FL, 1996)\u2019. Then\nyou notice you\u2019re dancing to the first-person account of the preparations\nfor the killing spree that lead to\nGianni Versace\u2019s murder.\n\u2018The Ground Walks, with Time in a\nBox\u2019 cheerfully predicts the manmade apocalypse we are collectively\nheading towards, \u2018Coyotes\u2019 and\n\u2018Pups to Dust\u2019 highlight that us,\nhumans, are born and die the same:\ncompulsive liars and serial killers\nwith an instinct for destruction.\n\u2018Sugar Boats\u2019 prods us into\nreflecting on our search for\nalternatives for this beautiful Earth\ninstead of attempting to fix it. \u2018Be\nBrave\u2019 warns us that the world will\ncarry on without us just like it has for\nthe almost totality of its existence\nand in \u2018The Tortoise and the Tourist\u2019\nBrock pens a modern Brothers\nGrimm fable on humanity\u2019s self-destructive ignorance that will lead us\ninto doom. We are questioned about\nour persistent focus on superficial,\npathetic problems in \u2018The Best Room\u2019\nand are prompted to explore the\noutdoors, embrace nature, enjoy it,\ntake it in, live and experience it before\nit is gone. This sixth and much-awaited work of the Washingtonian\nband then ends with a critique to\nnight? I had a look at change.org\nlast night, but only to sign the more\nrealistic plea to have Alan Partridge\nreplace Clarkson on Top Gear. It also\nturns out that the bloke who started\nthe petition hasn\u2019t even got a ticket.\nAnd since has money has certainly\nalready changed hands, I doubt he\u2019ll\nbe going for re-sale. Kanye is playing\nGlastobury, guys, get over it.\nGlastonbury tickets go on sale again in\nthe first week of April.\nour obsessive search for evidence\nof the existence or absence of a god,\nsomeone to blame for our actions or\nthe creation of our dooming instincts\nin \u2018Of Course we Know\u2019.\nOr so I think. \u2018Strangers to\nOurselves\u2019 is ridden with the Modest\nMouse trademark: cryptic lyrics that\nsomehow make sense to each one of\nus, regardless of interpretation and\nbackground of the listener. It is not a\ncurated playlist, nor a virtual mixtape\nof some songs for your spinning class.\nIt is a proper piece of work, written\nwith a purpose, a message, carefully\nthought, chaotically unlevelled yet\nsimultaneously balanced.\n\"We are\nso beyond\nthat point\nin 2008\nwhere\ntickets\ndidn\u2019t\nsell out\ninstantly\nwhen Jay Z\nplayed.\"\n\"Kanye is\nplaying\nGlasto,\nguys, get\nover it.\"\n\n"

Most of us will have our\nexams then, but if you\u2019re a student\nin their master\u2019s like me you might\neven have them next week. All\nin all, this is probably the least\nfavourite part of University life.\nI remember writing about revision\ntips at the end of last term but as\nthis article will come out when\nwe\u2019re about to head off for our\nrevision-packed holidays, it will be\nabout coping with the exam stress.\nNot just how to cope with stress in\ngeneral, but how to prevent it from\nbuilding up by developing better\nschedules.\nDesignated break each day\nHere\u2019s what happened in my\nfirst year of undergrad. Day one of\nrevision, I chugged down enough\ncoffee to wake the dead and blitzed\nthrough the whole day without a\nbreak. The next few days were spent\nshivering from the ordeal, making\nexcuses to stay well away from my\nwork desk. Understandably, my\nambitious revision timetable went\nto shambles.\nBe prepared for a marathon, not\na sprint. Revision isn\u2019t a caffeine-fueled all-nighter that you do one\nday before the deadline (I think that\nwas the mentality that secretly crept\nup on me). Instead, it\u2019s all about\npersistence of going back again\nand again to those lecture notes,\nday after day. To maintain enough\nsanity to do that, daily breaks are\nessential.\nGive yourself an evening off at\nthe end of each day (or an hour in\ndire cases). During this time, just\nforget about revision and exams\ncompletely and let yourself shrug\noff all those words and numbers\nthat cling onto you throughout the\nday. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t forget\nabout them. You\u2019re just giving\ntime for it to seep into your brain\nand latch itself there. Giving time\nfor your brain to consolidate new\nmemory is as important as the\nmemoriing process itself.\nMeet friends\nPreferably your course mates who\ncan help you step out your personal\nrevision hell to share some tips\nor just to vent on how much life\nwould be better without certain\nmodules. Or just friends back at\nhome to remind you that there\u2019s a\nworld outside of lecture slides and\ntextbooks as well!\nOne nemesis of revision (as I\u2019ve\nmentioned in my last article) is\ntunnel-visioning where you can\nforget what\u2019s actually important\nin the course, instead fussing over\nwhat seems important to you.\nCourse mates will shine some light\nin that tunnel and you might realise\nthat the situation isn\u2019t as desperate\nas you\u2019d thought.\nI understand that sometimes,\ndiscussing revision with course\nmates can sound the opposite of\nstress relief when you hear about\nhow well they\u2019re doing with their\nrevision. But one way to make it less\nintimidating is to ask precisely how\nthey revised and what they focused\non first. Seeing their plan of action\ncan help you find better ways to\ntackle the topic you\u2019re struggling on.\nReward yourself\nClassic grandma strategy, but\nstill effective. \u2018No, you can\u2019t have\nice cream until you help me with\nthe dishes.\u2019 Revision is hell of a lot\nworse than dishes, so why not give\nyourself some kind of a reward?\nAfter finishing a chapter, why not\nwatch a rugby match, catch up on\nyour TV series or just play a game?\nWorking towards a goal will make\nthe going less stressful.\nIn addition to making your days\nmore entertaining, it will refresh\nyour attention span and prep you\nfor another round. It can be a bit\nlike a reset button. If you start at\n11am and have a long day in front of\nyou, it\u2019s hard to stay motivated at all\npoints of the day. And when you\u2019re\nnot motivated, you procrastinate;\nstudents know this for a fact. So\ninstead of procrastinating during a\nrevision session, reward breaks can\ngive you a chance to clear the air\nthere instead.\nBuckle up and do it\nHear me out before you dismiss\nthis seemingly redundant tip.\nWhat causes the most stress when\nrevising is actually the fact that it\u2019s\nlooming over you like a rain cloud.\nThe longer you procrastinate, the\nmore that cloud darkens. The topics\nyou have to revise just seem that\nmuch harder, especially your least\nfavourite ones.\nTrust me, putting it further and\nfurther into the future will only\nadd to the stress. Maybe it\u2019s the\nfear of the unknown, maybe it\u2019s\nthe pressure of having less time to\nrevise, but it\u2019s something that can\nbe solved by gritting your teeth and\njust have a go.\nFor example, when you\u2019re revising\nthere\u2019s nothing scarier than going\nthrough a past paper, imagining\nhow badly you\u2019re going to fail it. But\nonce you gather enough courage to\nsit down and try it, you can either\nbe surprised that you understand\nit, or realise what topic still appears\nan enigma to you. Neither is as\ncatastrophic as you think when it\u2019s\nstill on your \u2018to-do\u2019 list.\nBut remember, despite all the\nstress, do leave out a week to have\nfun and make the most of spring\nback at home.

The\nTHE World Reputation Rankings\nare a spin-off supplement from the\ninternationally acclaimed THE\nWorld University Rankings, where\nImperial currently retains its strong\ntop 10 position.\nWhile the World University\nRankings utilize 13 separate\nperformance indicators grouped\nunder five categories: teaching\n(30%), research (30%), citations\n(30%), industry income (2.5%) and\ninternational outlook (7.5%), the\nWorld Reputation Rankings are\nformed using a large invitation-only\nacademic survey, which took place\nat the end of 2014 and saw tens of\nthousands of responses.\nBarring the University of Tokyo\n(12th\n), ETH Zurich (15th\n) and the\nUniversity of Toronto (16th\n), the top\n20 places in the Reputation Rankings\nare chiefly occupied by American\nuniversities, with British institutions\ntaking 4 out of the 20 spots. Harvard\nUniversity regularly tops the list;\nthis year it was followed by both\nCambridge and Oxford, which came\nin 2nd\nand 3rd\nrespectively.\nAccording to THE, the World\nReputation Rankings are \u201cbased\non nothing more than subjective\njudgement \u2013 but it is considered the\nexpert judgement of senior, published\nacademics, the people best placed to\nknow the most about excellence in\nour universities\u201d.\nInstitutions are not allowed to\nnominate survey participants, and\nno one is allowed to sign up for the\nsurvey without an invitation, thus\nmeaning that selected participants\nare representing thousands of their\npeers.\nThis year\u2019s survey is set to play a\nkey part in shaping the 2015-2016\nedition of the World University\nRankings, alongside a number of\nother reforms. THE will be releasing\nthe survey in 15 languages (Arabic,\nJapanese, Simplified Chinese,\nSpanish, French, German, Brazilian\nPortuguese, European Portuguese,\nSouth American Spanish, Italian,\nTraditional Chinese, Korean, Turkish,\nRussian and English), an increase\nfrom the 9 used in the last survey.\nIn addition, where the survey was\npreviously outsourced to Thomson\nReuters, THE is now seeking to take\nfull responsibility and ownership\nof the survey and its data, with\ndistribution being carried out in\npartnership with Elsevier. THE\nclaims that this extra control will\nallow it to \u201cpublish more detailed\nprofiles of institutional reputation\nglobally and to be more responsive to\nthe sector\u2019s data needs.\u201d\nPhil Baty, editor of the THE\nWorld University Rankings, said the\nfollowing: \u201cWe would like to thank\nin advance all scholars who will be\nhelping us to create this rich and\nimportant picture of global higher\neducation.\nBy lending a small amount of\ntheir precious time, and \u2013 more\nimportantly \u2013 by lending their\nexpertise, they will become part of an\nextraordinary global research project\nthat will shape the THE rankings and\nwider performance metrics\u201d.\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nSECTION EDITOR\nBudget 2015: Government announces\nplans for \u00a325,000 loans for PhD students\nCecily Johnson finds out what the new Budget has to offer\nThe government has revealed\nplans to offer income-contingent loans of up to\n\u00a325,000 for PhD and research-based\nmasters students in the latest Budget\nreport, George Osborne\u2019s sixth as\nChancellor of the Exchequer.\nAccording to the Treasury,\na package of measures will be\nintroduced \u201cto broaden and\nstrengthen support for postgraduate\nresearchers\u201d, including a review into\nhow to bolster the UK\u2019s funding for\npostgraduate research.\n\u201cThis review will examine the\nbalance between number and level of\nresearch stipends to ensure that the\nUK\u2019s offer remains internationally\ncompetitive\u201d.\nAs part of the review, the\ngovernment will consider various\nmethods to \u201cstrengthen partnerships\nand co-funding between government,\nindustry and charities\u201d, including\nincreased support for the crowd-funding of scientific research.\nThe proposed support package will\ninclude \u201cincome-contingent loans of\nup to \u00a325,000 to support PhDs and\nresearch-based masters degrees. These\nloans will be in addition to existing\nfunding, and designed to minimise\npublic subsidy.\n\u201cThe government will work with\nresearch councils, universities and\nindustry to examine how best to\ndesign them so that they complement\nexisting funding streams and\ncontinue to support the most\nexcellent research\u201d.\nNo details have yet been provided\nas to the timescale of introduction\nfor the proposed loans. Access\nrestrictions, repayment plans and the\nultimate costs of the loans to students\nhave also not been specified.\nA loans scheme offering up to\n\u00a310,000 for taught master\u2019s students\nfrom 2016-17 was announced by Mr\nOsborne in last December\u2019s Autumn\nStatement. These loans will be\navailable only to those under the age\nof 30.\nThe new Budget also proposes\nthe launch of \u201ca \u00a3400 million\ncompetitive fund for new world\nleading scientific infrastructure\u201d. The\nScience Grand Challenge Funding\nproject plans to seek funding matches\nfrom charities and industry.\nThe fund \u201cseeks to lever\nindustrial and charitable funds.\nThe government welcomes exciting\nproposals from across the UK that\naim to push scientific boundaries and\nmaximise scientific impact\u201d.\nA factsheet provided by the\nDepartment for Business, Innovation\n& Skills noted that the money was\npreviously promised in December\u2019s\nScience and Innovation Strategy\npaper, and is \u201can allocation of\nfunding from within the Science\nCapital envelope\u201d.\nThe Treasury stated that the\ngovernment hopes to \u201cprovide\nthe UK\u2019s world-leading research\ninstitutes with greater freedoms to\nattract the brightest minds, re-invest\ncommercial income and develop\ncutting-edge technology\u201d.\nThis is the last Budget to be\npresented by the current parliament\nbefore the next General Election later\nthis year. The winner of the election is\nlikely to present another Budget this\nsummer.\nMr Osborne has also announced\ntax cuts for first-time buyers, a 1p per\npint cut to beer duty and 2% off cider\nand spirit taxes, a crackdown on tax\navoidance and an increase of 16p in\nthe price of cigarettes.\nA 20p increase in the national\nminimum wage will raise it to \u00a36.70\nper hour from October, with a 3% rise\nin the statutory minimum for 18 to\n20 year olds taking the hourly rate\nfrom \u00a35.13 to \u00a35.30.\nWelcomed by business leaders\nand derided by Trade Unions,\nthe aspirational Budget has been\ncriticised by opposition parties and\ndescribed as \u201copenly electioneering\u201d.\nGeorge Osborne and his red box Photo: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images\nImperial was the 3rd\nhighest ranked UK university after Cambridge and Oxford Photo: Imperial College London\n\n"

Over our life time,\na quarter of us will suffer from a\nmental health problem.\nFelix has investigated what it means\nto have a mental health problem at\nImperial. We\u2019ve interviewed several\nstudents who have used the system,\nand also to members of staff who\nprovide help in one form or another.\nBased on students\u2019 experiences, we\u2019ve\nfollowed the route they might take\nthrough Imperial\u2019s support system.\nThe front line of help is the\npersonal tutor. In most departments,\nevery academic and some post-docs\nare expected to take this role. Some\nstudents we\u2019ve spoken to found their\npersonal tutor incredibly supportive;\nothers said they didn\u2019t know them;\nand others that they were actively\nunhelpful. Although new personal\ntutors receive training, long-standing\ntutors often rely purely on past\nexperience. Whilst the vast majority\nof personal tutors are extremely\nhelpful, they still need support too.\nOften a personal tutor will direct\na student to the student counselling\nservice. It\u2019s a confidential service\nprovided free to students \u2013 and we\nhave heard of people who had a very\ngood experience, but also from those\nwho didn\u2019t benefit from counselling.\nIt\u2019s not for everyone and shouldn\u2019t be\nseen as the only option.\nEvery student we spoke to had\nvisited the Imperial Health Centre\nand for most, it was the turning\npoint in their experience. Whilst\nNHS operated, it receives funding\nand support from Imperial. The GPs\nare recruited specifically because\nof their expertise in working with\nyoung adults and are equipped to\ndiagnose your problem and refer\nyou to appropriate treatment, be\nit Cognitive Behavioural Therapy\n(CBT), psychoanalysis, counselling or\nsomething else.\nThe funding of the health centre is\ncurrently under review for the first\ntime in eight years. It is vital that it\nis given continued support and its\nunique position to help all students\nhere is recognised. Students we spoke\nto who had to move to a different GP\nsurgery after graduating found the\nnew treatment was lacking.\nIt\u2019s getting closer to exam time \u2013\nthis is the point when students are\nmost at risk. Imperial\u2019s examination\nsystem is not best set up for ill\nstudents. Whilst it\u2019s possible to resit\nan exam you fail whilst ill, if you sit\nan exam and pass, even if by a small\namount, it\u2019s not possible to resit that\nexam without retaking the entire\nyear. This places an added stress on\nstudents; should they sit the exam\nanyway and hope they do ok or drop\nout and try again in September?\nRegistry should allow students with\na known problem to resit exams in\nSeptember, even if they passed the\nfirst time.\nOften students turn to the Union\u2019s\nAdvice Centre. Run by staff, this\nis a useful service for students to\nget impartial advice when their\ndepartment can\u2019t help. However,\ndespite having a Deputy President for\nWelfare, and welfare representatives\nin every constituent union (CGCU,\nICSMSU etc), no students are given\nany formal training. This is a missed\nopportunity to create a peer support\nnetwork.\nThere are many people doing\ngood work at Imperial, be it at the\ncounselling service, the health centre\nor academic departments. But there is\nroom to improve still. Personal tutors\nshould be encouraged to take up more\ntraining. The Health Centre and the\nCounselling Service need the support\nto run the services they provide at\nminimal waiting times. Registry\nshould change the way it treats ill\nstudents who sit exams anyway,\nrather than needlessly adding more\nstress or pressure at a time when it is\nmost unhelpful. The Union should\ncontinue its good work at the advice\ncentre, but should also make an\neffort to train its student welfare\nrepresentatives.\nOur mental health is something\nwe all have a part in, and we should\nall \u2013 students, staff and academics \u2013\ncontinue to improve one another\u2019s.\nHealth Centre\nEvery student we spoke to had used\nImperial Health Centre at some point in\ntheir journey and their experiences were all\npositive.However,there are concerns that\nthe relationship between Imperial and the\nHealth Centre could be weakened.\nHaving a health centre closely linked to the\nUniversity is a huge advantage.They are able\nto work closely with the counselling service\nand the disability advisory service to get\nstudents to the right help quickly.\nThey\u2019re used to Imperial students with\nmental health problems; a GP we spoke to\nhad seen six new students with a mental\nhealth problems that week alone.They have\nexisting links with Imperial\u2019s senior tutors,\nand know who to speak about a particular\nstudents\u2019needs.It makes absolute sense for\nthis service to be linked to Imperial.\nImperial funds the health centre so that it\u2019s\nable to treat all Imperial students,not just\nthose who live outside of its NHS catchment\narea.However,a recent College review\nrecommended that students see GPs local\nto their area.It remains to be seen if this\nrecommendation will be adopted.\nThis would be extremely bad for students\u2019\nwelfare.Students living further from Imperial\nare more vulnerable by the nature of being\nfurther out; and this will be more relevant\nwhen 650 freshers move into North Acton\nnext year.\nEvery student we spoke to who had received\ntreatment both at the Health Centre and at\nother GP surgeries found the help at Imperial\nvastly better.\nOne student said,\u201cI was in Battersea\u2013I took\ntwo months to get CBT...I went to the health\ncentre to see a GP and it was much quicker,\nthree or four weeks.\u201d\nAnother said,\u201cI moved out of the London\njurisdiction and had to redo the process...it\nwas then a complete nightmare\u201d.\nOur investigation would challenge the\nrecommendation that students are better\ngetting treatment elsewhere.Mental health\ntreatment is not equal across NHS surgeries\nand all students deserve equal access to\ntreatment irrespective of where they live.\nCounselling Service\nThe counselling process invites you to discuss\nany issue troubling you with someone trained\nto listen and respond to you.It gives people\nthe opportunity to air problems that till then\nhave been stuck inside them.There\u2019s nothing\nyou can tell them they haven\u2019t heard before.\nOne student told us that when they went,\nthe service was\u201ca huge help\u201d.However,by its\nnature,counselling doesn\u2019t provide practical\nadvice.This can sometimes be frustrating,\none student said,\u201cthey told me that my\nproblems were too big for them to handle\u201d.\nIt\u2019s important that the counselling service\nworks with the health centre to help all\nstudents.\nLast year they saw 540 students,which was\nan increase of 6.7% the previous year.College\nis responding to this need; the counselling\nservice tell us they\u2019re hoping to increase the\nnumber of appointments and decrease their\nwaiting times.\nCollege is expanding the role of the\ncounselling service to also provide\u2018mentors\u2019\nwho can give students practical advice to\ndeal with problems.This will take effect next\nacademic year.\nAdvice for other students\nWe asked students we met what advice\nthey would give to other students in similar\nsituations to them.The overwhelming\nopinion was that whilst,\u201cwhen you are\ndepressed,it\u2019s easy to feel that there\u2019s\nnothing that can be done\u201d,it was important to\nrealise that this wasn\u2019t the case.\nThe stigma around mental health makes\nit harder to come forwards.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk\nabout it\u2013it\u2019s really competitive\u2013makes\nyou feel weak,that you can\u2019t handle it like\neveryone else\u201d.One student said,\u201cThe main\nproblem is lack of awareness and students\u2019\nlack of willingness to talk about it\u201d.Breaking\nthrough this stigma and telling someone\nabout your problem is the hardest part.But\nwhen people did,it undoubtedly helped.\nA recent graduate said to,\u201cTalk to people,\ndefinitely someone academically.I\u2019d also talk\nto some of your friends.\u201dSpeaking to friends\ncan be difficult; it\u2019s difficult to know how\npeople will react and sometimes it\u2019s not the\nreaction you want.One student said,\u201cI was\nsleeping loads,I was self harming...it was a\npretty horrible time but I managed to hide it\nfrom everyone,it came as a shock when I told\nsome of my friends.\u201d\nThey told the story of when they spoke\nto their new partner,\u201csomeone asked me\nout\u2013I panicked and said yes...spent the\nwhole day worrying I had to tell them...\nended up blurting it out...it was horrible,but\nincredibly helpful\u201d.People around you may\nalso be able to give you advice,\u201cmy boyfriend\nsuggested I go to the doctor so I went to the\nhealth centre...I saw the GP there who was\nfantastic\u201d.\nAcademic departments\n\u201c[Revising was] the first time I thought of\ndropping out of university\u2013but my personal\ntutor was very supportive,the undergraduate\ndepartment was great\u201d.\nDepartments play a big part in our mental\nhealth.Often the triggers come from a\nstudent\u2019s degree,and the senior tutors and\nundergraduate offices are very experienced\nat helping students with problems.\nSpeaking to a personal tutor was for many\na surprisingly positive experience.Others\nhadn\u2019t built a relationship with their tutor\nso they spoke to the senior tutor or another\nsupervisor.It\u2019s important to remember\nthat since mental health problems are so\ncommon at Imperial,the departments have\na huge amount of experience helping (yes,\ngenuinely) helping students like you.\n\u201cTell the department\u2013they can do so much\nmore than you think\u201dsaid one student,\u201cthe\ndepartment are experienced,you\u2019re not the\nfirst person to have problems\u201dsaid another.\nSadly not all personal tutors are as helpful\nas they could be,\u201cI think I\u2019ve been quite\nlucky with a personal tutor...a friend\u2019s tutor\njust asked a group\u201cso is anyone considering\nsuicide?\u201d\u201dThe senior tutors in particular\nare well supported by the other services at\nImperial.\u201cI was never expecting a shoulder to\ncry on\u2013but [my personal tutor] was good to\nget direction from\u201d.\nThe departments are of course crucial to\nspeak to at exam times.If you sit an exam\nand pass it\u2013even if only just and you have an\nextenuating circumstances\u2013it\u2019s not possible\nto resit that exam without retaking the year.\nThis is unfair and puts an un-needed stress on\nstudents at exam times.\nOne student we spoke to sat their exams\nafter being persuaded to do so by their\ndepartment.\u201cI cracked on the first day [of\nexams],I wanted to drop out of the year,it\ntook a lot of persuasion to get me to not do\nthat...Very last minute they got me a room to\nmyself...I took all my exams in solitary...the\nexams were shit\u2013but I passed every single\none! (Well apart from one)\u201d.Of course they\nhadn\u2019t done as well as they deserved and\nwent on to retake the entire year,but taking\nthem had nonetheless helped at the time.\nDepartments don\u2019t always work,in which\ncase the College Tutors are the best place to\nturn as they are external to the department.\nEvery student we spoke to did have a positive\nexperience from them.\nStudents can only retake exams if they fail, regardless of the effect of mental health issues. Photo: Neville Miles\nFelixasks students\nWe found strong signs of a stigma around\nmental health problems here at Imperial\u2013\nwhich is daft because so many of us suffer\nfrom them.\u201cThe main problem is lack of\nawareness and students\u2019lack of willingness to\ntalk about it,\u201dsaid one student.\nA quarter of people suffer from a mental\nhealth problem in their life-time.Since you\u2019re\nmost likely to do so when you\u2019re young and\nunder stress,there\u2019s no doubt that many\npeople you know here suffer from one,even if\nyou don\u2019t yourself.\n\u201cThere is a stigma,it\u2019s why I won\u2019t admit it\nopenly...given how competitive people are in\nmy year,I think they\u2019ll see it as a weakness.\u201d\nThis is a common problem faced by students,\nbut particularly men.For example,depression\naffects both genders equally\u2013but 75% of\nsuicides are men.Another student said,\u201cI\ndidn\u2019t speak to many people,my flat mate\nand my parents,I was embarrassed...My\nparents know,my sister knows,my boyfriend\nand a couple of my friends\u201d.\nPeople who are not well shouldn\u2019t have the\nadditional stress of how society around them\njudges them.\nReducing stigma is a big part of the\n\u2018Mentality\u2019campaign (a Union initiative)\u2013but\nit\u2019s something we should all play our part\nin.\u201cEducate yourself\u201dwas a simple solution\noffered by one student.It\u2019s not hard to learn a\nbit about common mental health problems.\nDon\u2019t look down on it and be supportive to\nsomeone who comes to you.If someone\u2019s\nbrave enough to talk to you about their\nhealth,respect them for it and take them\nseriously.\nIt\u2019s not easy to bring up someone\u2019s health.\nOne student said,\u201ceven now I recognise\nsymptoms in other people,but I can\u2019t talk to\nthem about it...I find it difficult to bring up\neven if I know they\u2019re struggling\u201d.\nBe brave\u2013talk about mental health.

The exhibition\ntakes us on a tour of McQueen\u2019s\ncreative process, from initial concept\nsketches, all the way to his dramatic\nfinal show.\nThe collaboration started when\nWaplington was asked to come in\nand see Lee (Alexander McQueen)\nin 2007. McQueen wanted him to\nmake a photo book about his working\nprocess for his Fall 2009 collection,\nentitled The Horn of Plenty! Everything\nand the Kitchen Sink. Lee knew of\nWaplington\u2019s work and favoured his\n\u201cdirty, messy style\u201d of photography;\nhe gave Waplington full creative\ncontrol of the photography, telling\nhim \u201cdo whatever you want, this\nwill be your book and I will be the\nsubject.\u201d At the time, Waplington\nwas involved with a big project in\nJerusalem and asked McQueen\nif they could delay their artistic\ncollaboration, but Lee insisted that it\nhad to be the Fall 2009 season. This\ncollection was important to McQueen\nbecause it was a retrospective\nexploration of his previous\ncollections, a recycling of his ideas\nfrom the last 15 years of his career.\nThe book was an unconventional\ntake on fashion books. Not only\ndid Waplington take photo\u2019s of\nMcQueen\u2019s creative process, but he\nalso took pictures of landfill sites,\nand in particular recycling facilities,\nto further convey the collection\u2019s\nrecycling theme. Between the\nphotographs of McQueen\u2019s creative\nsketch boards and model fittings lie\nlarge canvases of landfill sites full\nof soda cans. Whilst the collection\nemphasised recycling, it also served as\na social commentary to the recession\nat the time, and how society had\nreached this point through \u201crampant,\nindiscriminate consumption\u201d. The\nirony lies in the garments themselves,\nwhich are made to look like they\nhave been made of bin liners and\nbroken records, when in fact they are\nmade from the finest Italian silks.\nThis follows McQueen\u2019s undeniable\npenchant for the unconventional,\nwhilst also respecting the traditional\ncraftsmanship of haute couture. This\nrepresentation of conflict throughout\nthe collection is an uncompromising\ncombination of love and hate, which\nis characteristically McQueen.\nWalking through the gallery\ntakes you through the collection\u2019s\nchronological creative process,\nemphasising one of the greatest\nthings about Waplington\u2019s insightful\nimages; they show that McQueen was\nheavily involved from the process\nfrom start to end, which is rarely\nseen in the fashion industry. First,\nhe would create an \u2018idea board\u2019 where\nhe assembled his creative vision for\na piece with photographs, fabrics,\nand sketches. Then, he would cut\npatterns, pin them onto a model, and\nfit her into it at the end. Even when it\ncame to final fittings, McQueen was\nthere, kneeling down and perfecting\nhemlines down to the last detail.\nWaplington was sure to capture\nall of this, showcasing not only\nMcQueen\u2019s creative flair, but also\nhis tailoring skills, which he learnt\nat the beginning of his career when\nworking at a suit-tailoring boutique\nin London\u2019s Savile Row.\nIn keeping with the theme of\nrecycling, vintage McQueen pieces\nwere remastered, such as his signature\nhoundstooth check fabric, which\nwas splattered with paint. Old pieces\nwere taken apart and put back\ntogether again in different way; inside\nout, upside down, or completely\nrestructured all together. Lee even\nused one of his own bespoke Savile\nrow suits in the collection, which he\ncut and re-tailored to fit a woman.\nNot only did Lee recycle pieces from\nhis previous collections, but he also\nbrought back many people he worked\nwith in previous years, including\nmany models. He brought everything\nback into play again to signify a\n\"The show\ntakes us on\na tour of\nthe creative\nprocess,\nfrom inital\nconcept to\nfinal show\"\n\"The irony\nlies in the\ngarments,\nmade to\nlook like\nbin liners\nbut made\nof fine silk\"\n\"To this\nday\nMcQueen\u2019s\npieces\nprovoke the\nreactions\ndesired\nfrom the\npublic\"\n\"We see\nnot only\nMcQueen\u2019s\ncreative\nflair, but\nalso his\ntailoring\nskills\"\nrenewal.\nThe collection saw a historic\ncollaboration between McQueen and\nPhilip Treacy to design eccentric hats\nthat were tailor-made for specific\noutfits. The hats too, used recycled\nparts, such as washing machine\nhose piping and even dustbin lids.\nThey served as an important tool\nin shaping the proportions of the\nmodels wearing them, who were\nmade to look much like exaggerated\nillustrations. They were taller, longer,\nand leaner \u2013 a commentary on the\nunrealistic image of women that the\nfashion world portrays.\nWhen the studio moved to Paris\nclose to the show, the atmosphere\nbecame happy and at times stressful\nin the lead up. McQueen worked\nwith big teams from whom he\nexpected a lot, and there was a\nsense that everyone was working\ntowards a common goal. The set\ndesign was complex, incorporating\npiles of rubbish and other debris,\nall underlining the theme of\nconsumption and recycling. The\nshow was also a challenge for the\nmodels, who had to wear very high\nheels, heavy hats, and complex\nclothes. In keeping with McQueen\u2019s\nundercurrent of conflict throughout\nhis collections, the models were made\nto look less feminine; red lipstick was\nsmeared above and below their lips,\ncreating an almost disturbing image\nof beautiful women. This served as a\nreminder of society\u2019s obsession with\nphysical appearance.\nAfter the collection was shown,\nLee and Waplington worked together\nin Waplington\u2019s studio, where\nWaplington made 800 colour work\nprints by hand. Of these, Lee and\nMcQueen selected 254 to feature in\nthe book.\nThey finally finished in November\n2009, and three months later Lee\ndied.\nFor Waplington, it was a huge\nprivilege to work with Lee and gain\ncomplete, unadulterated access to\nthe creative working process in his\nstudio, which he rarely opened to\nothers. Lee\u2019s choice of title, The Horn\nof Plenty, was a statement about\nthe planet and its finite resources,\nof consumption and economic\nprosperity, of the recession and the\nimpossibility of infinite growth. It\nwas a reflection of modern society\nand a retrospective of his previous\ncollections, bringing them all\ntogether in his final collection. As\nthere continue to be new exhibits\nand commentaries on McQueen\u2019s\nrevolutionary work, he lives on as\na fashion and artist. To this day,\nMcQueen\u2019s pieces provoke the\nreactions he desired from the public \u2013\nfor them to look at it and say: \u201cWhat\u2019s\nthat? What\u2019s that? What\u2019s that? What\nthe hell is that?\u201d\nNick Waplington/Alexander McQueen:\nWorking Process is on at the Tate\nBritain, until 17th\nMarch 2015.\nTickets are \u00a314.50 adults; \u00a312.70\nstudents.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 9\n20.03.2015\nFELIX\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCampaigning is hard work...\nLet\u2019s get one thing out of the\nway first: yes, I did just lose\nin the Big Elections. Yes, I am\nextremely bitter about this. Yes, you\ncan read the whole article as just a\nsore loser whining about losing sorely\nif you want.\nThat said I do have some things to\nsay about the whole ordeal.\nThe summary, really, is that I feel\nmassively burned by this whole thing.\nI invested a lot of my self-worth, and\na lot of time in this campaign, and\nlosing has hit me on a deeply personal\nlevel. I\u2019ve wanted to run for DPCS for\na year now. I wrote my manifesto at\nChristmas. I started the poster and\nflyer designs a month in advance.\nAnd then, when we were officially\nallowed to start campaigning, I\nspent almost every minute of almost\nevery day out on campus talking to\npeople, handing out flyers, putting\nup posters, doing lecture shout-outs\nto pretty much every year group in\nevery department\u2026 all the stuff they\ntell you to do to win an election.\nI caught a horrible flu bug on the\nfirst Thursday, but came in on Friday\nanyway to keep campaigning. To\ncampaign properly and get the best\nshot at winning, one needs to put\none\u2019s degree and life on hold for two\nweeks, and you can still lose.\nThere\u2019s no party politics here \u2013\nevery vote is up for grabs, every \u2018seat\u2019\nis a swing seat. You probably have a\ncouple of hundred assured votes from\nyour mates and \u2018factions\u2019 such as\nsocieties \u2013 the other 3,500 votes (the\nrough number who made a vote for\nDPCS) are totally up for grabs.\nIs it at all possible to convince\nenough of these people to vote\nfor you to make it actually worth\ncampaigning? A few years ago a\ncandidate for Union President won\nover 2,000 votes and still lost.\nHow can we be expected to reach\nout to all those thousands of people,\nwhen everyone knows that the\nonly sure-fire way to get a vote is to\nactually go out and talk to the person?\nJust making it rain flyers isn\u2019t good\nenough. Just putting your face on a\nposter isn\u2019t good enough.\nI genuinely believe based on\nmy experiences in this election,\nbased on everything I\u2019ve learned,\nthat campaigning, in its entirety,\nis pointless. Ben and I were very\nsimilar candidates \u2013 similar levels of\nUnion experience, similar manifesto\npoints, very similar ideologies\u2026 How\ncan there be a meaningful political\ndiscourse between two candidates\nwith such little separating them?\nI personally think that the number\nof voters whose opinions were\nswayed by any of our campaigning\nwas far smaller than the number of\npeople who \u2018entered the booth\u2019 either\nknowing they were going to vote for\ntheir mate, or not having interacted\nat all with any candidate. That latter\ngroup presumably had nothing but\nthe pictures and manifestos to go on\nwhen making their choice.\nSo what\u2019s the alternative? I\u2019m not\nhere to suggest one. The current\nsystem burned me badly. But\nmaybe it really is the best of a lot of\ncompromises.\nWould I run for a sabbatical role\nagain if I had the chance? Probably\nnot; in my opinion it is not worth\nthe time and effort those two weeks\nrequire to campaign, even if you do\nwin.\n... but there is a witty rejoinder\nI\u2019m not going to come out spewing\nrainbows and say that campaigning\nwas the most fun I\u2019d had all year. It\u2019s a\nstressful experience, and one that you\nneed to prepare yourself for.\nI was very lucky; I had a strong\ncampaign team, and a number of\npeople I could whine at when it all got\na bit much. I also enjoyed the chats\nI had about my plans, and Union\nstuff that people actually care about.\nI learnt how a campaign works, and\nalso some of what this year\u2019s Sabb\nteam are going to have to focus on.\nThe experience of campaigning is\nnecessary to do the job. Sabbaticals\nshouldn\u2019t necessarily be the most\ntechnically competent person \u2013 that\u2019s\nwhat staff are for \u2013 but they should\nbe the most relatable person to the\nstudent body.\nTom claims that convincing\nsomeone to vote for you is \u201ctotally\npointless\u201d. If you can\u2019t convince\npeople to get behind you though, how\nare you going to be the most relatable\nperson to that same student body?\nI have a huge amount of respect for\nhow hard people campaigned, and\nthe commitment of other candidates\nin this year\u2019s elections intimidates\nme to some extent. But some of them\nmissed the point.\nWhat I think this election has\nmade clear is that there needs to be\na dialogue about candidates\u2019 welfare\nduring elections fortnight. With all\nthe bright, colourful posters all over\ncampus, it\u2019s easy to forget the possible\neffects on the rest of your life.\nThe Returning Officer briefed us all\non the first Monday of campaigning,\nand he made a point that the struggle\nwith student elections is not to get\npeople to vote for you, but to got\nthem to vote at all. It\u2019s also not until\nthis meeting that you hear the words\n\u201cmore than half of you are going to\nlose,\u201d and I think this doesn\u2019t hit\nhome with people until it is too late,\nand they have already committed to\nstanding in the election.\nI agree with Tom when he says that\na large majority of voters weren\u2019t\ninvolved in the election and didn\u2019t\ninteract with those campaigning.\nPeople log on, look at the pictures,\nmaybe read a manifesto or two, and\ncast their vote. And immediately\nforget about it. However, even if the\nvoters may not be the most invested\nin the campaigns, the candidates are;\nelections can take over their lives for\ntwo weeks and require considerable\nemotional commitment.\nThe Union has a \u2018Campaigns\nCo-ordinator\u2019 and four other staff\nmembers directly involved with HR,\nstudent development and general\nwelfare. Why can\u2019t some time be\nallowed to debrief some of the\ncandidates in person, rather than\nan impersonal 1-5 scale of how you\nthink it went, like the survey that\ncandidates are asked to fill out after\nthe elections are over?\nI will say that you should definitely\nconsider running for a Sabbatical\nin next year\u2019s Big Elections. Not all\nelements of campaigning are for\neveryone, but you can make it work to\nyour strengths; and if you do, it\u2019s fun.\nAnd if you don\u2019t win, remember\nit\u2019s not the end of all things. After all,\nthere is definitely more to life than\nImperial College Union.\nTOM RIVLIN\nCONTRIBUTOR\nBEN HOWITT\nCLUBS & SOCS EDITOR\nABI DE BRUIN\nDP (CLUBS AND SOCIETIES)\nCampaigning\nain\u2019t all bad!\nThis year seems to have\nseen an unfortunate turn to\nthe negative with a lot of the\ncampaigning that\u2019s been going\non\u2013particularly it seems to\nhave been less enjoyed by the\ncandidates and it\u2019s such a shame.\nI absolutely loved campaigning;\nit was two of the greatest weeks\nI\u2019ve ever experienced.I loved\ntalking about how much I loved\nthe Union and wanted to be\ninvolved in it full time,spending\ntwo weeks talking about how\namazing our clubs are and the\nincredible things they do was\nsomething I couldn\u2019t get enough\nof.\nSure it was completely and\nutterly exhausting: I got ill,I\ngot stressed,I lost a lot of my\nfaith in my ability to actually do\nthe job,but I also got to spend\ntwo weeks being completely\nencouraged by all the support\nfrom my friends and family.It\u2019s\nan incredible position to be in\nto get to experience weeks of\nfriends wandering round with\nyour face on their shirt,and\ntelling other people why you\u2019re\ngreat.There\u2019s very few other\nsituations where you can get\naway with making your friends\ntell you you\u2019re awesome for two\nweeks straight,and if you\u2019re even\na little narcissistic,you should\ntotally run for a role just because\nof that.\nWandering round the JCR\nwith bags of sweets; chatting to\nrandom strangers wherever I ran\ninto them; and doing shout-outs\nin what I think was over thirty\nlectures was exhausting but so\ncool.Telling people what it was\nthat the Union did,explaining\nwhy I wanted to get involved,\nwhat it is I would actually be\ndoing,and then why they should\nvote for me to be the one doing\nthat meant that I got to spend\na lot of time being challenged\non my motives and actually\nconvincing people that I was\nthe right person for it.Taking a\nrandom stranger from a\u2018who is\nthis crazy person talking to me,\nwhat is the Union,what are they\ntalking about?\u2019 to\u2018oh maybe\nI\u2019ll vote in these elections,and\nmaybe I\u2019ll vote for her\u2019was a\nreally exciting experience.\nGenuinely,the passion that\npeople show off during election\nseason is incredible to watch,\nand seeing the amount that\nsome people really care about\nwhat goes on here is one of the\ngreatest things about being\ninvolved in the Big elections.\nWhat do you think?\nShare your thoughts on our articles,online! www.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"
