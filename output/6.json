    "content": "- 9 -College Rugger ,\nI.C, rug ger is in a bad way, Why do so many players leave science at South Kensington on Wednesdays and Saturdays\nand think it has no place on the rug ger field? Probably the best game for some time was that between\nthe Mines and the R.C.S. on March 1 st. The R.C.S, deservedly won 6-0 and showed, commendable keene s s and will to win. Wheatley and Severn played very well behind the scrum for the R.C.S., Cook hooked consistently and Colin Morgan scored the points. Things clearly went right for the R.C.S, in this game, but it was not really surprising that against the Guilds on the following Wednesday they had to struggle hard to win30. This was not because the Guilds were good, but because\nneither side showed enough knowledge of the game to score\nexcept by accident. The Mines Guilds game will be fought for the Engineers Cup In the traditional manner, but the Guilds will have to show all round improvement if they are not to be beaten by a Mines side which is probably not as strong as usual. There are individuals in all the College sides who will do well in senior rugby, but unless se me effort is made to get players to think about the games when they are playing, we shall not see the U.L, cup a tI.C. In about a dozen\ngames this season, I have never seen I.C. or College teams\nbeat the opposition by a planned attack. As for a knowledge\nof how to use the touch and the punt ahead, how to make the best use of the elements and of tactics generally, it hardly exists. This could be remedied if there were fewer games and\nmore practice.S, R. Sparkes.\nHYDE PARK ROAD RELAY RACE.\nSatu rd, ay, M ar ch 1 1 th. Of course it's really no consolation to us for the loss of the Rod eric Hill Cup, but the eleven Universities and\nColleges who visited us were full of admiration for our\norganisation, and the finish of the race proved so close that,we almost forgot that our own team came fifth. In fact I.C. were never in the first bunch, which, after the first lap, consisted of Battersea, King's, Southampton and Loughborough.\nThese four continued to fight out the lead, with Loughborough\ngetting the best of it until the last lap. Then Barrett of\nBattersea, and Dujon of King's, two well known University milers, went away from the others, Dujon held a five yard lead at the Serpentine Bridge, but by running wide at the final turn into the finishing straight, allowed Barrett to draw level. Amid scenes of great excitement, Barrett forged ahead to win the race for Battersea. His time,13 mins,48secs. beat the record lap time set up by Bob Gigg of I.C. last year by lOse cs. Although never in the running for first place, I,C. nevertheless defeated. Birmingham and Reading,\ntwo traditional rivals of ours. This was largely due to a finely judged piece of running on the last lap by Ted\nWhitlock. We have no excuses for not winning; not even that Samways was chased by a bulldog;.\nA.B, W.I,.

    "content": "- 1 -EDITORIAL.\nSPRING IN THE AIR.\nThis being our last Issue this terra, and Spring being in the air, FELIX Is in genial mood, and our thoughts are\nturning to the best way of spending the Easter vacation. This is the season when the young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love( for a change!), when we emerge from\nour winter hibernation and discover that Nature is Wonderful, and start to think of our summer pursuits. Unfortunately, for the poor I.C. student this season\nis overshadowed by the realisation that Nemesis is nearly upon him, that the dreaded exams. are only a few weeks beyond\nthe end of the Easter vac. When he thinks about this his brow becomes stern and he grimly determines to use the four weeks respite to catch up with all the work he has not done\nin the last two terms.\nHowever, it only needs a little sunshine and the smell of afresh spring day to dispel these gloomy thoughts and\ngood resolutions, for after all there are some seven weeks\nfor the summer term before exams, and if these seven weeks\nare to be fully used, surely one should relax now? Excellent Nature wins again. Having thus talked himself into doing what he wanted\nto do anyway, our student then sets about enjoying himself, and incidentally, what better time could there be for a brief visit to the Continent? When next term comes, the Flap will be on, but we shall be refreshed in body and mind to cope with it. It is a constant source of amazement to each successive generation of\nstudents just how much can be achieved in those few brief weeks of the summer term, in spite of the vast number of\ndiversions which appear.\nThe regrettable thing about this is that the normal\nhealthy young man should spend his summer out of doors, not\nstuffing in his room and brown-bagging. The standard of I.C. cricket is not up to University standard because of the\ndifficulty of find in d time to practice, and the Boat Club's Henly eight suffers from the lack of good oarsmen who will not row after Easter. What a pity wo have to have exams, in the summer.\nWhat a pity we have to have exams!\nAnyway, we wish all our readers a very happy Easter. NICKEJ.ODQUrvS IN THE AIR.\nI.C. has suddenly been struck by an epidemic of\nputting nickels in nickelodeons. Wherever one goes, somebody\nwill be whistling humming or \" rendering\" the tune in some\nway, and at Saturday hops the record is greeted with acclamation and a gay joining in of the choruses. Last year\nthe same thing happened with\" Cigarettes and Whiskey\",\nWhat makes these tunes suddenly popular? Not the tune,\nsurely, for there is little enough of it, It might be the\ncatchy rhythm, although it is not unique in this, possibly the rather suggestive words, or just the personality of the\nsinger. Anyway, who cares? put it on again, Reg!\n\n"

    "content": "- 5 -THE DRINKING MAN'S GUIDE 1,0 LONDON.\nSUNDAY LUNCHTIME.\nA \"great number of people, whether they are regular drinkers or not, make a habit of having a glass of beer at\nlunchtime on Sunday, The afternoon is free, and usually quietly lazy, and the effect of a good lunch is greatly enhanced by a beer before it, It is not a time when one wants\nto drink much, and the choice, of a pub will be determined by\nthe type of company, the excellence of the beer, and In the\nsummer, facilities for drinking in the sun, Many quite ordinary pubs assume an entirely new character on Sunday, and\nIs hall try to give a guide to a few of the better ones,-in\nWest London.\nTwo of the best have already been described, the Windsor\nCastle and the Swan, the former being almost ideal as a Sunday pub. Nearer College, the Denmark (near the bottom of\nQueen's Gate), and the Gladstone and the Bunch of Grapes near\nBrompton Oratory deserve mention the latter at the moment\nseems to be a favourite re ndez vous of the more wealthy, and\nis often referred to as the Vatican Arms. The Nag's Head\n( surely known to all I.C.) and the George IV in Montpelier Street, are two nearby pubs that have the virtue of being open\nuntil2.30 p.m. Going slightly farther a field there are the Scarsdale Arms ( just west of Earls Court Rd.). the Red Lion( just off the road opposite the Curzon cinema) and the King's Head and\nS Fells at Chelsea are all places'where one can s it out on the\npavement and be sure of pleasant company. One last tavern must\nbe mentioned, and that is the Star, a little mews pub in Hankin\nPlace, on the west side of Belgrave Square, to which the\nclientele come in an assortment of cars and taxis from all over\nLondon.\nThis is, of course, by no means a comprehensive list that would need several issues of Felix but it should serve as a guide to anyone who wants a quiet, pleasant drink in a congenial atmosphere.\nE.M. H. UNION PAR.\nWe learn that the ancient firm of Whitbread' s is to.\nsupply beer in the bar from Easter time. The price will be 7gd. for mild and 8-\u00a7d \u00ab f ov bitter but with the greater beer\nconsumption expected It is hoped that this sale price may be\nreduced. If it is as good as we expect, many of us will choose\nto do our drinking in the Union bar instead of elsewhere, which will be a Good Thing for the Union.

    "content": "- u PROFILE; PROFESSOR LEVY.\nIn a second floor Huxley study, on the Chair of Mathematics sits Prof. Hyman Levy, Dean of the Royal College of Science and Head of the Mathematics Department- a formidable combination of responsibilities which he appears to carry effortlessly. This impression is suggested by the ease with which one may approach him; and for twenty minutes he talked with me informally, smoking the inevitable cigarette, his hair fanning out into space.\nHe graduated at Edinburgh and brought away also a brogue\nwhich might almost be worn- but not worn away, this in spite of the blandishments of Oxford, Gottingen and London. His e herr rh s between sentences give one just that extra time to get down a vital point. Prof. Levy regards lecturing as a problem of making intellectual and emotional contact with his audience. \" I get a great kick out of lecturing\" he said, \"and seldom come out of a lecture of mine without learning something.'\" Prof. Levy pointed out that lecturing was a relic of mediaeval times and had two crucial problems to solve today lecturing under modern conditions, a not insoluble problem, and more important how to reconcile the vast content of knowledge today with a limited period of study. He thought\nthe latter problem might mean wholesale reconstruction of the modes of instruction, and perhaps the study of the principles in a whole field combined with specialized courses in one chosen direction, However the problems of lecturing are not all of this nature. Some years ago, called, down to. a basement lecture room, Prof. Levy found the door barricaded; the lecturer pale and helpless outside and an uproar coming\nfrom within. The miners were on strike. With great momentum\n( sic) he split the door open and cried \"Stop - just as you\nare\", and for five minutes harangued the assembly as they stood there in their frozen attitudes. The peace restored, the miners' complaints were later dealt within the cooler atmosphere of Prof. Levy's study. \" Students are reasonable people,\" he said,\" there is usually some substance behind a protest of this kind\". As Dean of R.C.S. Prof. Levy has\nstudents coming to him with problems ranging from financial troubles to love affairs. \"There have been some quite dramatic scenes in this study\", he said. He has the happy knack of talking to students as equals; his informal manner puts one\nimmediately at ease and one never leaves him without feeling stimulated. One gets the impression of confidence in himself and in the world around him.\nFor recreation Prof. Levy turns to Music and Politics. He has a large collection of folk music from all over the world, and he has composed some songs \"which have even been\nperformed\". As for politics his views are well known and we\nleave readers to study them in his many books - and, on the lighter side, in his witty after dinner speeches.\nC.M. H.R.C. S. NATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY DINNER.\nThe 52nd Annual Dinner of the R.C.S. Natural History Society was held on Thursday March 9 th1950. It was pre cee ded by an address \"The Next Million Years\" by the Distinguished Visitor, Sir Charles Darwin. This scientist and philosopher made this an opportunity to launch his views on the future of mankind, and a depressing picture it made.' In the animated\ndiscussion that followed topics ranged from the consumption of dogs by the Chinese to the use of alcohol as the world's future power supply the criticism of Malthus by Has let t to the demerits of curbing the human passions. Dinner followed in the Upper\nDining Hall and memorable among the speeches was that of Prof. H,H. Read when proposing the toast of the Ladies, which drew a spirited reply from Miss J. Spencer.\n\n"

The larger number of students appears to have required a more rigid organisation of classes than we are accustomed\nto. Individual classes usually comprise no' more than thirty students, which requires of course what seemed to me a quite enormous teaching staff. Formal lectures are not given so much\nas hour \" - instruction periods\"; these start at9 a.m.(in summer\nat 8 a.m.) and run right through to5 p.m. during a5s day\nweek with some free periods depending on the individual timetable. Courses are based on set textbooks out of which the\ninstructor gives daily homework; in class he may go through\npreviously set problems or, if necessary, attempt to explain the text. The usual B. Sc. course takes four years to complete;\nthe system of examinations I will leave to mention in my\nnext article together with some comments on the social and\nresidential aspects. M.I.T. includes a department of Humanities and about one\ncourse in every six attended by the Undergrad.u ate student in his first two years is given by this department. One term it might be History, another English and so on ( I should mention\nthat the academic year consists of two 16-week terms). I am\nquite convinced that these courses are not something extra which the American gets and the Englishmen does not but that the difference is that the English undergraduate has already had their content at school before he comes to a University. From a scholastic point of view the American schoolboy is not educated to the same standard as is the English boy- hence,\nas I mentioned earlier, the different' material' on which the\nAmerican University has to work.\nSOILED MAW(\\ Qf\\lN '\n\n"

    "content": "2 -OH BEING EXCHANGED.\nAbout six weeks ago I walked \"into the Union for the first time in twelve-months and was almost\u2022 immediately, -.co'rne red In-: the\ndraught y part of the bar by a determined individual who said all in one breath\" Hallo, have you had a good trip? Will you have^\na drink?'.'. 'ill you write for Pali::?\" Being compelled to answer the first two queries in the\naffirmative, and realising with most unusual circumspection that this was one of those all or nothing situations, I knew\nthat it would be regarded as at least ungracious not to reply to the th rid question \"Yes, but who is Felix?\" I know better of course by now. As soon as he realised that I'd committed\nmyself the determined individual carried on \"We have to go to press on Monday\". He has offered me this same piece of\ngratuitous information once each fortnight ever since; so here,after the fourth time of asking, we are. I thought at first that I might attempt to make this account either alphabetical of chronological but changed my mind and decided in the end\nto let it be more of a haphazard history. If you have a pigeonhole type of mind you'd better not read any further* and if the Editor doesn't like it he'd better not type any\nfurther. There are innumerable angles to College life anywhere\nand after my experience of spending twelve months as an\nexchange teacher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n- the American counterpart of Imperial College I could start almost anywhere; but before we do begin with details it should be emphasized that whilst I am pointing out some of the\ndifferences between English ways (as exemplified at I.C.) and\nAmerican ways (as illustrated at Tech.) these are only isolated features in a general picture which in many respects is very similar on whichever side of the Atlantic you happen to be\nlooking. And some of the contrasts stem from the fact that the American University is provided with rather different raw\nmaterial( in an entirely metaphorical sense) and required to\nfurnish a somewhat different product from the English University one consequence of this is a much larger student population M.I.T. has over 5?000 and is small in comparison with many\nAmerican Universities, some of which have between 20,000 and\n3 0 , 0 0 0 . A greater number is available therefore for all the\nvarious College activities; thus, for instance, to compare\nwith Felix, M.I.T. can call upon sufficient interested students to produce a twice weekly six page publication of Evening Standard size. They run and man their own printing press and\nit is exactly a miniature but real newspaper. This must afford great enjoyment to the paper's staff but whether it is best from the customer's point of view is doubtful, for it is quite apparent that there is an insufficiency of news and articles to warrant such frequent issues and they are made up of at\nleast50 L advertisements. Cambridge, Mass. is to the City of Boston what Kensington or Westminster might be to the City of London, and M.I.T. being centrally situated in such a large metropolis is fortunate to\nbe located along one bank of the Charles river, which at that point is both wide and slow. The College possesses an excellent sailing club with a Clubhouse just across the road from its main buildings: it is therefore not surprising that in inter varsity sport M.I.T. gains most of its successes in sailing fixtures. On the whole sporting activities are not particularly encouraged although, with the exception of football, all the\nusual American games are catered for' the major sports are: in winter, basketball and icehockey, and- in summer, baseball and athletics. M.I.T. is quite unusual amongst American\nUniversities in not deriving much of its publicity through its football team; it does not possess a stadium capable of holding up to SO,000 spectators nor employ a coach earning a yearly salary of 30,1+0 or 50 thousand dollars.

    "content": "TOUCHSTONE\n(The touchstone was used by the ancients to test the\nquality of precious metals.) Three years ago the College acquired a large country house\nset in about a hundred acres of park and woodland, at Sil wood Park, near Windsor. I.C. Field Station has been used, chiefly by biologists but also from time to time by surveyors and\nmeteorologists. And there, last week end took place a gathering which promises to be of major historical importance in the\nevolution of Imperial College. A man, when he finally goes down from a University, should be possessed of something within him he would not\notherwise have had. Erudition and technique may be acquired in libraries and workshops. But a gracious affection for men\nand for learning, and the seed of an integrating philosophy of life sown in a ground well ordered and tended are hardly to be come by in early life outside the Universities. On Saturday 1 1 th March some thirty representative members\nof the College, students. and staff went down to Sil wood as\nguests of the Rector and of Professor and Mrs. Munro. In most\npleasant and informal surroundings they lived for two days,\neating, sleeping and on occasions drinking and discussing together what ought to be: the relation of liberal studies to our science& technology, the need to be met- diagnosing a complaint and seeking a cure and at the end they presented their conclusions. Prom these small beginnings are to spring further weekends\nat Sil wood Park, to which any who chooses may go to talk and\nplay, and on the touchstone of companionship and discussion assay their metal and find themselves. Sil wood is eventually to become a regular feature of all our lives. The conception and execution of the \"Touchstone\" idea( which includes the \"Ends and Means\" Lectures and Dinner in Hall) have been all the Rector's. In the brief years of\nthe Rector's office, as Prof. Levy remarked on Sunday, he has\nwrought more subtle and more pro foi md advances than have been\nmade within the College since1908. \"MANDRACtOLA\"\nThe I.C.
