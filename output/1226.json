    "content": "reviews book\nInterview with Evan Hunter\n(Ed McBain)\nCan you tell us a little about your background?\nWell, I was born on a kitchen table on a blanket in Manhattan;\nmy Aunt Jenny was the midwife. I was raised on and around\nNew York and I went to New York City schools. In 1944, I joined\nthe Navy and it was while I was in the Navy that I decided that\nI wanted to become a writer. Before then I was studying art and\nso I had a complete change in direction. Instead of going to art\nschool, which I had been attending, I decided that while I was\nat college I would concentrate on writing.\nI held a series of jobs and eventually worked for The Scott\nMeredith Literary Agency with other writers such as Larry Block\nand Donald Westlake. From there I continued to write and I eventually sold my novel, The Blackboard Jungle and the rest, as they\nsay, is history. Ed McBain came into being in 1956 when my publishers approached me and asked me if I had an idea about a mystery series.\nWhat was the reason behind the Ed McBain pseudonym? Was\nit that you and your publishers believed that Evan Hunter\nwouldn't sell writing in the mystery genre?\nNo, it was their belief that it would be damaging to my career as\na serious novelist if it were known that I was writing mystery\nnovels.\nSo back in the 1950s the idea of a serious writer writing a mystery novel was somehow beneath them?\nOh yeah. There was this critic, I can't remember his name, for\nThe New Yorker magazine who had written an article called\n\"Who Cares What Happened to Roger Ackroyd\" and it implied\nthat anyone who wrote a mystery was a nitwit and anyone who\nread them was a half wit.\nSo did these comments set back mystery writing in the 1950s? Well this critic was very respected and the belief at the time was\nthat reading crime fiction was not a proper literary pursuit. This\nbelief is absurd today. If you look at the bestsellers list in the\nUnited States of the 15 titles, 7 or 8 titles are mysteries.\nSo what changed the public's perception?\nWell, Ed McBain came along, well that's not exactly true but in a sense I added a little class to the mystery novel. For a while back\nthen when you went into a bookshop the front of the store was\nfull of romance novels while now its mystery books.\nWhat are you're actual mechanics of writing?\nI get to work between nine and ten every morning and I work\nstraight through, well I have a break for lunch with my wife, and\nthen I lock the door at six in the evening. When I first started out\nI worked a day job and so the only time I had to write was after\ndinner, in the evening or at weekends. I sort of vowed that I'd always work more regular hours if I ever had the privilege to\nwrite full-time which I have been lucky enough to do. I sometimes break this rule if I have an imposing deadline but I try to\nstick to these regular times.\nThe 87th precinct novels are very much admired as police procedural novels. How did you go about the research for these\nnovels? Did you have any contacts in the police departments?\nI did far more research when I was starting out although to\nbegin with the police officers that I contacted were not very\nreceptive. I'd just had The Blackboard Jungle published and they\nthought I was coming in to do a number on them, to show how\ninept they were. I managed to convince them that I was going to\nwrite sympathetically about cops and they began to accept me\nwhen they realised how serious I was. The police are a nice\nbunch of people considering the hard job that they have to do.\nWhat for you were the benefits of creating the city of Isola\ninstead of using New York City or any other real city?\nI changed it so I didn't have to call the police every five minutes\nbecause it would seem that they would change the procedure for\ninvestigating a crime about every two weeks. I thought this\nwould just lead to trouble. Also I didn't want to get involved with\nany lawsuits by using real numbers or real addresses. So instead\nI made it a mythical city, which I like. I can stick a park or a building anywhere. But you know, I 've been to Edinburgh but I would\nwager that your average reader hasn't so if Ian Rankin says that\nthere is a castle in the middle of town I 'll accept it, for me its a mythical city.\n/\nAre you still as enthusiastic about writing today, as you were\nwhen you started fifty years ago?\nOh, I love it. I'm trying to think why I feel so good in the morning\nwhen I'm starting work. For me, there is a problem to solve every\nmorning and also a challenge for the day ahead. Each morning I re-read what I did the night before and I make hard copy before\nI put the computer to sleep. It's always invigorating when you sit\ndown at the computer and finish a scene or you stumble on\nsomething that triggers an idea for the next chapter. It really is\nvery exciting work.\nEvan Hunter was in London promoting Money, Money, Money\nand the two mystery bookshops have signed editions of this.\nJonathan\n\n"

    "content": "music reviews\nChemical Brothers\nCome With Us\nOut now on Virgin records\nThankyou, Chemical Brothers, for a wonderful new addition to the world of electronic music.\nBack in'99, I was very disappointed\nwhen the Chemicals released Surrender\nwhich was, to my ears, a very bleak and\nuninteresting offering. There were a few\nstandout tracks, like the catchy Hey Boy\nHey Girl, but a lot of it just wasn't particularly memorable.\nBut here, from beginning to end, every\ntrack is at least decent, and none sound\nout of place. The two singles, It Began in\nAfrika and Star Guitar, demonstrate the\nmore conventional side of the album, but\nthey're good examples of what to expect.\nStar Guitar itself, whilst not ground-breaking ly original, is still a great track.\nHighlights include the opener Come\nWith Us, which starts off with a slow yet\nfrantic violin sample and, after a Chemicals drum roll, builds into a good\nrival for Loops of Fury or even Block\nRocking Beats. The final track The Test is\nparticularly funky, and this is not the only\ntime when vocals play a major part - The\nState We're In features some lovely\nhaunting vocals from Beth Orton. The\nChemical Brothers seem to have mastered this kind of tune - unlike Orbital,\nwhose Otoho was a lame effort.\nPioneer Skies is a very pretty little num-ber, though it seems to be based around\njust one idea, and Hoops is very strange,\nbut these tracks still seem to fit in well\nwith the rest. Another stand-out is\nGalaxy Bounce, a classic Chemical\nBrothers track which shows that the duo\ndon't have to completely change their\nstyle to make great music.\nCorporate Avenger\nFreedom Is A... Out this Monday on Koch records\n[Full title: Freedom Is A State Of Mind]\nYet more ridiculous nu-metal from a bunch of oversized teenagers who probably wear suits to their day jobs and go\ncavorting with the Territorial Army at\nweekends. Clad in the de rig eur sub-Hellraiser clothes and make-up, superficially they're just another Slipknot derivative. A bunch of idiots - amusing, noisy\nidiots, but idiots nonetheless.\nIs it really worth describing the music?\nAfter the harmless intro and yet another\nsong on the theme of Fuck Da Police, we get some politics. Christians Murdered\nIndians starts with a reading of the\nSpanish King's proclamation to the\nNative Americans, and followed by a lot\nof ranting about the resulting massacre.\nThere are plenty of other would-be\nDead Kennedys lyrics, which are delivered in an amusing shout y style. The\ntracks are peppered with scratchy bits,\nbass beats and breaks, following the\nwell-tested House Of Pain model. Every\nsong starts with either a monologue or a movie clip (Taxi Driver, etc) and then proceeds to expound a particular viewpoint:\nTaxes are Stealing, Voting Doesn't Work,\nThe Bible is Bullshit (and the Qu'ran, and\nthe Bhagavad Gita...). This works for\nabout two minutes on each track, then\ngrates on the nerves, and then repeats.\nThere are some truly humorous\nmoments: \"I'm not saying this is good,\nI'm not saying this is right, but maybe the\nvirgin Mary was a hermaphrodite\" on\nJesus Christ Homosexual. They're not taking themselves seriously, and neither\nshould we. Coming soon to a stadium\nnear you.\nCOMPETITION\nThis week, we're giving away the\nsoundtrack to the film How High,\nfeaturing Redman and Method Man.\nQUESTION: What is the name of\nRedman's most recent solo album?\nPlease email your answer to\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk by Thursday.\nLHB\nTell' Em Who We Are Out Monday 11 Feb on Telstar records\nPlaying this for the first time, I was\npleasantly surprised to hear a very clean-cut piece of chilled-out house.\nIt is difficult to tell exactly where you\nshould place LHB, as they seem to borrow methods and styles from people as\nfar apart as Kinobe, the Chemical\nBrothers and Ian Brown. All the songs\nare quite different, and there is no definitive LHB hook, other than purely relaxing\nbeats perfect for the after-club comedown or the Sunday afternoon chill-out\nsession. For all I know, LHB could stand\nfor \"Light House Beats\", and if it did, that\nwould be an apt description.\nThe best tracks on the album are\nComing Up For Air, Tell 'Em Who We Are\nand Cuba. These are the ones that show\nthe most complete amalgamation of\nbeats and vocal samples, creating eminently loveable tunes. In fact, Coming Up\nFor Air sees a collaboration with Imogen\nHeap, an experienced campaigner in the\nchilled avant-garde market. Her vocals\nadd a human element to the otherwise\ncomputer generated sound of the group.\nTeJJ 'Em Who We Are is completely differ-ent, in that it uses sampled vocals to create that otherworldly sound which acts\nas a perfect re post to the self-promotion-al aspect of the song. The other strange\nthing about this track is the addition of a beat box to create the bass rhythm.\nSounds horrible; works like a charm.\nThis may not sell very well, as there is\nnot enough \"catch in ess\" to grab the\nhearts and minds of the general public,\nbut it will almost certainly feature somewhere on the next Ministry Chillout\nSession CD.\nRobin Robert HOD Tank\n\n"

    "content": "film reviews\nVanilla Sky\nreleased 25th January\nA good film is one which gam s in reflection. A couple of days\nafter seeing Vanilla Sky and I'm thinking, Bam! What a load of\nnonsense. I remember leaving the cinema and thinking that\nwas great. I enjoyed that very much. Now I'm thinking what a implausible plot twist at the end. Not so much a twist as a Chinese burn.\nThe truth is that Cameron Crowe's retelling of Alejandro\nAmenabar's1997 movie Abre Los Ojos (probably means Open\nYour Eyes) is one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen.\nDavid Aames (Tom Cruise) is a high flying magazine publisher\nwho has much money, many women, and a Ferrari. He has an\non-going relationship with Julie (Cameron Diaz), \"a friend he\nsometimes sleeps with\". But there's trouble when he falls for\nSofia (Penelope Cruz), which leads to Julie becoming jealous\nand driving him off a bridge in her car. While this is all happening we are shown flash-forwards (like flash-backs except in the\nfuture) with David Aames in a prison cell, wearing a prosthetic\nmask, and being interrogated by psychologist McCabe (Kurt\nRussell) about someone's death.\nWatching this, I asked myself several questions: Why is Aames\nin a prison wearing a mask in the future? Whose death is\nMcCabe talking about? Have I got enough change for a pint\nafter this? In that respect Vanilla Sky is engaging. The clues are\nthere it's just a matter of putting them together to work out\nwhat the hell is going on.\nWith its 'mind-blowing' finale Vanilla Sky fails where other films\nlike The Usual Suspects and Memento succeeded. It just does\nnot work. It doesn't make you gasp, you just sit there thinking,\nso what was the point of the previous 2 % hours? The script just\nis not up to the task and nor for that matter is the acting. Tom\nCruise may be worthy of an Oscar nomination, but the rest of\nthem just are not as committed to the cause. It is as if some of\nthem were in it just for the money or something.\nOverlong and pseudo-intellectual Vanilla Sky is only notable for\nCruise's paranoia-filled performance as the self-centered David\nAames. But by the end of it I was hoping for this Cruise-control\nvehicle to Cruz to a halt. In fact if it was a Cruz missile...\nMonsters Inc.\nreleased 8th February\nBedtime. Your parents have left the room. The lights have been\nswitched off. You are at the mercy of your imagination. There are\nmonsters in the closet, under the bed, behind the curtains. All of them ready to pounce. The moment you fall asleep. In the\nnight. And out of sight. Speak for yourself I was a born-physicist and my mantra was what you cannot see does not exist,\nand what does not exist has got little hope of doing any harm.\nMonstropolis is the city where all the monsters live. The city's main power source is human screams, which are captured by an\nelite team of monster 's carers1, who enter the human world\nevery night to scare children and to collect their subsequent\nscreaming. But today's children do not scare as easily as they\nused to, so the city is faced with a potentially disastrous energy crisis.\nMonsters Inc. is the largest scream processing factory and\nJames P Sullivan, whose nickname is Sulley, is an eight foot tall\nblue-green monster. He is the most successful s carer. He is a role model for all the up-and-coming s carers. His best mate and\nscare-assistant is the little green, one-eyed, Mike Wazowski.\nThe plot takes off when Sulley accidentally lets a human child,\nconsidered highly toxic and dangerous, into the Monster world.\nMayhem ensues as Sulley and Mike try to hide the child from\nthe authorities until things can cool down so that they can send\nher home safely. The plot takes a further turn when the duo\nstumble across the number two s carer Randall Boggs' evil plot\nto boost energy production.\nMonsters Inc. is the latest in a series of computer animated features including Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Toy Story 2. This\ntime Pixar Entertainment have taken their art form to a different\nlevel in terms of their mastery of the artistic medium. With an\nenormous budget of $115 million (not bad for a cartoon) Pixar\nhave set new industry standards.\nDirected brilliantly by Peter Docter, Monsters Inc. is pure enter-tain ment. It made me laugh proper, and when it finished, I was\nsad. Just go and see it. In fact, I'm going to see it again as soon\nas the Monsters Ink on this review dries.\n\n"

    "content": "film interview\nInterview With...\nJohn Lasseter (producer)\nPete Docter (director)\nLee Unkrich (co-director)\nJohn Lasseter is the original founder\nand creative genius behind Pixar\nEntertainment, the computer animation coma He is an oscar winning\ndirector and has been dubbed the\n\"Walt Disney\" of computer animation.\nMonsters Inc. is Pete Doctor's directorial debut. He was one of the first\nanimators hired by Pixar and has done\nsignificant work on all their feature\nfilms including writing the script for\nToy Story.\nLee Unkhch's career began in 1991\nediting music videos. He now specialises in background and live animation effects. He's co-directed Toy Story\n2, A Bug's Life, and Monster Inc..\nWhere did the idea for Monsters Inc. come from?\nPeter Docter: Two things that I knew were true for me as a kid.\n1 - that my toys came to life when I wasn't in the room. And2 that there were monsters hiding in my closet waiting to scare\nme. And so it seemed like a lot of other people had the same\nexperience.\nJohn Lasseter: What we strive to do at Pixar is to come up with\nsome subject matter that the audience can relate to. And after\nwe started talking about everybody's own personal experiences\nwe knew this was a common theme.\nPD: So the idea came out of trying to answer the question why\nmonsters scare kids. They don't do it just because they're mean\nbecause that's what you just get told. But maybe it's because\nthey're trying to entertain other monsters. Like a reality TV\nshow, or maybe even a sporting event where the top guys go in,\nthey scare the kids and all the other monsters watch and say,\n\"Very good, very good.\"\nBut that didn't really go anywhere. So then being parents we\nknew that children are an extremely unstable source of energy.\nVery volatile. So we thought maybe the monsters go in, scare\nthe kids to collect their scream and the scream is the power\nsource in the monster world. The idea kind of extrapolated out\nfrom that.\nJL: The idea actually started around the time we were working\non Toy Story. Pete was the supervising animator on Toy Story. I directed it. And I always knew Pete was going to direct his own\nmovie some day.\nDid you aim Monsters Inc. at a particular target market? Will\nadults like it just as much as kids?\nJL: At Pixar we always make movies for ourselves. We aim at\nourselves. As reasonably intelligent adults. We love to laugh,\nwe love to be moved in an audience, we love to see action, so\nthat's kind of the approach we take. We don't get influenced too\nmuch from the outside. We just concentrate on making movies\nfor ourselves.\nWe're also parents and we love to take our kids to the movies.\nSo in order to entertain adults and teenagers and so on, we\ndon't put in subject matter or language that might be unsuitable\nfor kids because we are aware that we want to entertain kids\nas well.\nIt's a high standard that we've set for ourselves but we're very\nproud of that. And I think, now this being our 4th film, we are\ngetting a following which is kind of nice.\nAt the opening weekend of Monsters Incorporated in the\nUnited States we did record business. But what was very exciting was that 40% of the tickets sold that weekend were to people without kids. So that was the teenagers, college students,\nyoung adults, and old adults without kids. And all the evening\nshows and late evening shows, 10.30 shows were sold out and\ntheatres across the country were adding midnight shows for aU rated animated film. So we're really proud of the fact that\neverybody enjoys our movies.\nIn what ways has Monsters Inc. technically superceded Toy\nStory 2?\nJL: At Pixar, the technical development is really driven by the\nneeds of the story. We don't just come up with some new technology and say, \"Hey, let's use it in the movie\". We come up with\na story that lias something in it that we don't know how to do,\nand then we set out to try to achieve it.\nThe fur on Sully was probably the biggest technical advance\nin this film. Inherently, the more organic something looks or\nmoves, the more difficult it is to do with a computer. The computer likes things simple and geometric. And hair, clothing,\nskin, are extremely difficult things for a computer to do con-vinci n gly. So when Pete came up with this idea to have the main\ncharacter to be furry it was a big challenge.\nThe technical artists may grumble a little bit, but they love\nbeing challenged. Pixar is a pioneering company. Everything\nwe've ever done, no-one's ever done before.\nDoes the choice of voice actor affect the characters, or the\nway they appear on the screen?\nPD: Yeah, it really does. We don't cast our films based on how\nfamous an actor is, it's more about the talent that they have and\nhow closely they fit what we're looking for.\nIn the case of Sullivan we needed someone with a great deal\nof strength and power to do him because he's the best, top scar-er. But he also needs to have a sense of vulnerability as he\nbecomes parent to the girl. And John Goodman fit the bill well.\nWe then record with the guys before we animate, of course.\nWe do all the voice recording first. That's when they start to\nbring their own person na to the part and we end up re-writing\nthe script to fit the actor, so that the character in the film is tai-lor-made for each actor.\n\n"

No of players: 62\nI knew this would happen - the Bond quote from issue 1224 has The Leader Board - top 20\ncaused uproar of the magnitude we first saw when we suggested that Name Score\nUncle Owen was Obi Wan's brother. Two points - firstly The Spy Who Daniel Sauder 85\nLoved Me came before Moonraker, and Bond is quoted as saying Anthony Rodriques 79.5\n(when discussing Jaw's role as a professional killer to Anya) \"His Andrew Ince 78.5\nname's Jaws....he kills people\". Looking from a chronological point of Simon North 78.5\nview, this should be your answer - traditionally in GFQQ if a quote John Anderson 78\nappears in more than one film, we take the earlier film as the correct Christopher Dent 74.5\nanswer. However, as so many of you got it wrong, I will definitely look Chris Ince 74\ninto the matter and award points only if I am satisfied that the ident i Rebekah Hymas 62.5\ncal quote appears in Moonraker. Michael Simonds 62.5\nThanks to Anthony J. Rodrigues for pointing out that Jaws wasn't Arosha Bandara 61\nthe only henchman not to be killed - Nick Nack (the Man with the Gregory Mann 59.5\nGolden Gun) survived his encounter with Bond; at the end of the film, Fred Marquis 58.5\nBond leaves turn suspended within a wicker basket. Baron Samedi, Geoff Lay 58\nfrom Live and Let Die, also isn't killed by Bond. At the end of the film he Kim Randell 58\nis seen sitting on the back of the train.

    "content": "election special\nDo You Think You\nFriday 8th February sees the papers for application to be a Union\nSabattical come down. That means you have one week from\ntoday to get round to the first floor of the Union and put your\nname down on the list outside the Union Offices. You also have\nto be proposed by someone (anyone: your housemate, lab-part-ner) and get twenty second ers to sign their name underneath\nyours. You will then attend two hustings, later in the month, and\nhope full ly get voted in before March.\n\u2022 You do not need to have worked for the Union ever before.\n\u2022 You do not need to be a boring bureaucrat\n\u2022 You do not need to have finished your degree\nMy point is that anyone can stand for this job. Even me.\nIt is fun. It is good experience. It is better than getting a proper job. And what's more you have the potential to change the life\nof every single student at this University for the better.\nSo below we have the five jobs you can apply for. One of them\nis mine. Can you guess which one? Well done, you're even intelligent enough to go for it. The excellent gentlemen who have\nlooked after these jobs for you this year are here to tell you why\nyou should apply for their job, and not the others. Notice words\nlike 'teamwork' and 'responsibility'. Ignore them. Well don't, but\nrealise that there is more to it than that. These guys only have\n200 words to get across the concepts, so they don't have time to\nwax lyrical about everything, but between them, these jobs\nencompass everything that is important to all students. Now, go\ntalk to them and find out more.\nDeputy President Of Education & Welfare\nDavid Francis d pew@ ic.ac.uk\nWhat does the job involve?\nThe job is definitely Education and Welfare, not Welfare and\nEducation. My first priority is the education of all the Union's members. I take views from students and pass them on to\nCollege staff and tutors as well as in the other direction.\nWho should stand for the Education and Welfare post?\nIf you're going to do this job, you've got to be a team player -working with the other sabbatical officers is really important.\nEvery Monday we get together, discuss the events of the previous week, and work on what's going to happen the following\nweek.\nAlso, don't be discouraged from standing if you're not a \"Union\nHack\" - you get to know how the structures work very quickly,\nand some of our best ideas come from people who don't know\neverything about the Union.\nFinally, you've got to be a good communicator, and you've got to\nhave thick skin if people criticise you or make personal attacks.\nWhat have you accomplished this year?\nI think the ethos of the Union has changed a lot this year - it has\nalways been focused on clubs and societies up and until now,\nbut I think people this year are realising the importance of educational representation too. There are also more tangible goals,\nlike raising money for good causes.\nWhat are the disadvantages?\nSometimes you have to deal with distraught people even though\nyou're not a trained counsellor. It can be frustrating working\nwithin the Union when you want to get something done. It takes\ntime working with students who have degrees to do, but democracy is important and we couldn't do without it.\nDeputy President Of Clubs & Societies\nRob Davenport dpc s@ ic.ac.uk\nWhat does the job involve?\nThe Freshers' Fair is the biggest task, which is hard also because\nit's the first thing you have to do. I 've got to make sure all the\nclubs and societies know what to do. Also, along with the Union\nManager, the DP(C&S) has joint responsibility for health and\nsafety in the Union.\nWho should stand for the Clubs and Societies post?\nYou've got to be approachable and patient. Everyone who comes\nto you,is a volunteer, giving up their time to run clubs, so you've\ngot to give them guidance and expect them to make mistakes\nsometimes. A cool head is definitely helpful, especially when\nyou come into the line of fire if something has gone wrong or if\npeople let you down. Finally, you've got to be a team player.\nWhile most of my time is taken up with clubs and societies stuff,\nall of the sabbaticals work together to run the Union.\nDo you need to have had lots of clubs or Union experience?\nIt's helpful to have been involved in at least one club, though the\ngreater the number and variety, the better. There are certainly\nother clubs, but it's useful to know about sports clubs, as some\nof the issues can be quite complicated.\nYou don't need to be too politically minded either. If you don't have your own political agenda, then you'll get lots of requests\nand suggestions from students.\nWhat are the disadvantages?\nThe DP(C&S) often has to deal with people outside College but\nI much prefer dealing with students. Also, there are committees\nwhich don't have much to do with clubs, but which all the sabbaticals must go.to - it's hard to get interested in all of them.\nIs it hard to work inside the Union's democratic structure?\nAs a sabbatical, you work for the Union all day, but students are\ndoing degrees and it can be easy to get frustrated sometimes\nwhen the students haven't thought everything through fully. But\ndemocracy is important, and worth a little inconvenience.\nspecial election\nCould Do Better?\nFelix Editor\nWill Dugdale felix@ic.ac.uk\nWhat does the job involve?\nMy main priority is to get Felix out on a regular basis, while not\nmaking a loss for the Union (who partially fund it). As well as\nthis, I often find myself helping out with other publications.\nSome officially, such as the Union Handbook, and others just\nhelping out with design or editorial work.\nWhat's so great about it?\nYou answer to no-one, really. I am accountable to Council on\nsome levels, but only so far as they can sack me, and that's not\nan easy process. Fundamentally you can say anything, and\neverything, and hopefully this can be done on behalf of the stu-dents. Also you get to flex design, managerial, editorial, political\nand writing skills. Seriously good experience.\nWho should stand?\nIt's certainly useful to have some Quark (Desktop Publishing\nProgram) skills, but not necessarily: you can always learn them.\nYou have to be friendly, persuade people to work for nothing,\norganised (which I'm not really, and I suffer for it), and commit-ted: if I don't reach a deadline, Felix doesn't come out.\nWhat are the disadvantages?\nIf you are not an insomniac, you will be. Most of my editorial\nwork happens in the evening or at night, due to having to wait\nfor copy from writers and sub-editors, but all the managerial\nwork happens in the day time, getting advertising and suchlike.\nIs it hard to work inside the Union structure?\nHahaha. I tried to avoid it, but in order to make editorial decisions, write news stories, and even just find out what's going\non, you need a very good understanding of both College and the\nUnion. I 've learnt a lot about both, without even wanting to...\nPresident\nSen Ganesh president@ic.ac.uk\nWhat does the job involve?\nEverything. As President, I have to co-ordinate the Union's activities and represent the students to College. I also have to take\nultimate responsibility for the Union's actions. This means\nyou've got to have a wide knowledge about everything that is\nhappening, including trading and personnel. I also had to make\nthe Commemoration Day speech, which involved speaking to\nover five thousand people.\nWhat's so great about it?\nAlthough I have to take this responsibility, I have to work with\nthe other sabbaticals as a team, which makes a big difference.\nWho should stand for the post of President?\nSomeone who likes a challenge. You have to be organised and a quick learner - you'll encounter lots of unfamiliar situations and\nneed to deal with them just like any other. Obviously, the job\nalso requires a lot of diplomacy.\nAs many people as possible should apply!\nDo you need to have had lots of Union political experience?\nNo, not necessarily. It might help, but then it would also be good\nto get a fresh perspective, which wasn't based on previous\nUnion political situations. The position doesn't have a specific\nmandate so you really do make what you can of it.\nWhat are the disadvantages?\nThe job can be admin-heavy, and it often involves long hours to\nget everything done.\nIs it hard to work inside the Union's democratic structure?\nIt can be challenging, particularly when you've got to gain consensus - processes can certainly take longer, but it's good for\nstudents and very important.\nDeputy President Of Finance & Services\nBen Hawkins d pfs@ ic.ac.uk\nWhat does the job involve?\nI manage the finances of the Union, and work with the sabbatical team on Union policy.\nWhat's so great about it?\nIt's a great way to spend the year. You get experience from the\npermanent staff and you get an insight into finance and man-age ment. There's always something to be done.\nWho should stand for the Finance and Services post?\nSomeone who knows and can talk to students and explain\nfinance issues. You don't need to have experience with finance\nor management, as you can learn these during the handover. If\nyou're politically motivated, then there is certainly scope to\nexplore this, but you don't need to - it might even be an advantage not to have a background in Union politics.\nWhat are the disadvantages?\nYou'll sometimes find you have to spend more time writing\nreports for committees than doing your job.\nIs it hard to work inside the Union's democratic structure?\nIt sometimes feels restrictive but you can always see the point.\nIt would be nice to make a decision rather than waiting for the\nnext committee meeting, but you can see why these structures\nare there to make sure you're doing your job.\n\n"

Three\nmasochists per for in contortions in Pippikin Pot, and a new 'Sunday' cave is found.\nWith the forecast for gales\nand heavy rain, IC3 decided\nto go pot-holing in Yorkshire,\nto see if we could catch a bit\nof snow too.\nSoon after leaving college at\n8pm we were stuck in traffic\non Notting Hill Gate, a little bit\nlater we arrived at Bull Pot\nFarm, Lancashire. The drivers\nraced us North through atrocious rain, spurred on by some\ngood tunes, they must have\nbeen on something stronger\nthan tea, everyone else was asleep. Arriving at Bull Pot\n(home of the Red Rose Cave\nand Pothole Club) at lam, without a key we were\nrelieved to find other people\nthere, lots of people, in fact\nOxford and Cambridge CCs plus a few Manchester. A quiet nights sleep on a mattress was only broken by talk\nof vomiting and mystery illnesses in the night.\nSaturday, three masochists\ndecided to do Pippikin Pot to\nLink Pot, in the 80km Ease Gill\nsystem. While two more sensible people did Cow Pot, aiming to have a look at the\nimpressive Ease Gill main\nstream way in flood. The Cow Pot Team were held up an hour\nfor some suspiciously\nSouthampton looking cavers\nto do some SRT (Single Rope\ntechnique) training on the 25m entrance pitch to Cow.

    "content": "Evan Hunter was born in New York City in 1926. He studied\nart at the Art Students League in New York, and then at\nCooper Union. Before Hunter began writing full-time he held\nmany different vocations such as schoolteacher, a lobster\nsalesman, and a literary agent. In 1954 his novel The\nBlackboard Jungle, set in the public school system of New\nYork City and drama ti sing student violence as no other novel\nof its time did, was published to great acclaim.\nUnder the pseudonym of Ed McBain, Hunter created the\n87th precinct set in the city of Isola (which is based very loosely on New York.) The first 87 novel appeared in 1956 entitled\nCop Hater and the 51st in the series, Money, Money, Money\nhas just been released by Orion in the UK. Below are reviews\nof the last two Hunter novels Candyland and Money, Money,\nMoney opposite is a interview with the man himself.\nCandyland\nEvan Hunter/Ed McBain\nCandyland is a novel in two parts. The first half written by the\ncritically renowned author Evan Hunter while the second part\nis the work of Ed McBain, the creator of the 87th precinct nov-els. The interesting twist being that Hunter and McBain are the\nsame person and each gives their own literary and gripping\nstyle to both parts of this novel.\nThe Hunter part of the book recounts the story of Benjamin\nThorpe's night in the city of New York. Thorpe is a well-respect-ed architect on the West Coast and is in New York for a party\ncelebrating the opening of a building that he designed. Once\nthe party is over, Thorpe returns to his hotel, calls his wife and\nhe then sets out on a course that will go someway to changing\nhis life. Thorpe is a sexual compulsive. Almost all his thoughts\nand tales regarding the good times in his life revolve around\nthe act of sex. Armed with his little address book (all in code in\ncase his wife gets hold of it) he seeks out a number of women\nthat he knows in the city. When that fails he visits a high-class\nwhorehouse, the XS salon. An hour later he is lying in the gutter after being bloodied and beaten by the manager but luckily for him a woman helps him out of the rain (the pre verbal hooker with the heart of gold) and takes him back to her apartment to get cleaned up. Once there he realises some shocking\nfacts about his past and the way his life is going.\nAt this point Ed McBain takes over. The next morning a female prostitute is found dead, and the case is assigned to\nEmma Boyle, a NYPD detective attached to the rape squad.\nThe prostitute worked at the XS salon and also had dealings\nwith Ben Thorpe on the night of her murder.\nI personally enjoyed the two parts to this novel, especially\nthe insight into the mind of a sexual compulsive. Even after he\nis beaten up, Ben is still interested in having sex with the\nwoman that helps him. By doing this, Hunter is portraying\nThorpe's problem as a very deep-rooted one, similar to any\nother addiction and not as an instrument of humour. The\nMcBain part of the story is very much in the police procedural\nstyle with an ending both shocking and very chilling. For me,\nthe characters are very human and the dialogue is particularly\nstrong. I look forward to the next Hunter/McBain outing.\nbook reviews\nMoney, Money, Money\nEd McBain\nMoney, Money, Money is the 51st87 th precinct novel by the\nmaster of the police procedural novel, Ed McBain.\nCassandra Ridley is a female pilot who served with the 101st Airborne in the Gulf War. When she is approached with a simple flying job in Texas that involves courier ing four packages\nacross the border to Mexico and bringing back the same number in return, which is probably a drugs shipment, she believes\nit is an easy way of making her a large sum of money. The job\ngoes so well that after the final packages have been delivered\nshe gets a bonus of ten thousand dollars. On her arrival back on\nthe East Coast just before Christmas she starts to spend the\nmoney. When a burglar, Will Struthers raids her apartment, she\ntracks him down and regains her money and her property. It\nwould seem though that the money that she handed over to the\nmen in Mexico is not as clean as it should. In fact its counterfeit\nand they decide to cross the border to get what is rightfully\ntheirs. They pay a visit to Cassandra and the next day she is\nfound in the lion's den at the city zoo being devoured by the\nhungry lions. Steve Carella is put in charge of the investigation\nalong with fat Ollie Weeks from the 88th precinct. This is due to\none of Cassandra's legs being eaten by a lion in the 88th; the\nboundary of the two precincts being directly through the lion\nenclosure.\nThe plot from here takes many different turns involving greed,\ndouble-crossing and, of course, murder. Many different groups\nof people ff om drug dealers, the government and also a publishing house are interested in getting hold of the money.\nThe humour is provided by Fat Ollie Weeks, who cannot think\nof anything but eating. He is a racist and he hates all minority\ngroups equally. One of the best scenes in the whole book is the\npiano lesson where Ollie is trying to play \"Night and Day\" and is\nstuck on the first three notes. Joking aside, Ollie is a first-rate\ncop and saves Carella's life twice in the book.\nThe twists in the plot and the continual saga of the detectives\nof the 87th make this a winner and confirm this reader's belief\nthat this is probably the best police procedural series ever.\nBoth Candyland and Money, Money, Money are published by\nOrion, priced at \u00a35.99 and \u00a312.99 respectively.\n\n"

    "content": "INTERVIEW with\nNat and Gary from Haven\nreviews music\nBetween The Senses\nOut this Monday on Radiate records\nIn the British rock world, Haven are being tipped to break\nthrough and fill the current gap in style between Starsailor and\nMuse. So what is there to make of their debut album?\nThe first thing you notice is the sheer brilliance of Gary\nBriggs' voice. His soaring vocals add a real depth to the lyrics,\nwhich will not be matched by many... ever. This in itself would\nmean nothing if the music backing up the vocals was not of the\nrequired calibre, but fortunately it is. The rhythms laid down by\nIwan Gronow on bass and Jack Mitchell on drums allow Nat\nWatson to build up the melody into a fully involving experience.\nThis is never demonstrated better than on the absolutely sublime Out Of Reach. Here, the verse is backed by a contemplative\nbass riff, and Watson slowly builds up into the heady heights of\nthe chorus, which allows Briggs to let loose with his voice. Out\nOf Reach is preceded by the equally brilliant Say Something (the\nforthcoming single) and followed by Still Tonight. These two\ntracks are quite different in their approach, but they still get you\ninvolved in the song. And there lies all that is good about Haven\n- the songs surround you before you can get away, and stay in\nyour head for hours.\nThis by no means a complete album - there are a number of\noccasions when the relative pitches of the vocals and guitars\nare mismatched, creating something that sounds distinctly odd.\nThis is made all the more remarkable when you discover that\nthe album is produced by none other than Johnny Marr, formerly of The Smiths. The problem is particularly acute on Is This\nBliss, and although Briggs has a wonderful voice, it becomes\nclear that the right mix of music and vocals is essential.\nThe overall feel of the album is that the best is at the begin-ning, and that it slowly degenerates as they run out of ideas,\nbut this only means that they still can and will improve as time\ngoes on. The album also suggests that Haven have the potential to be a stadium-filling live act to conquer America. Not bad\nfor four blok es from Cornwall!\nHaven's debut album Between The Senses (see review, left) is\nout on Monday. Felix spoke to Nat and Gary from the band\nbefore one of their recent gigs at the Water Rats Theatre.\nFELIX: You two met in a record shop - where did you meet the\nother two members of the band?\nNAT: I was playing with another two guys - we were just making a racket - and I met up with Gary and suggested to him that\nhe came over. We weren't writing songs; we were just abusing\nour ears really. Gary came over and started the whole writing\nthing off.\nGARY: We found Jack sort of wandering around in Manchester\n- we were looking for a drummer, and he looked like one. And then when we started talking to him we realised he spoke like\none, and when he sat behind a kit he was one, so that was a pretty good day.\nWhy did you want to be in a band?\nGARY: For me, being in a band happened by accident, but I was\nalways going to be writing songs and I was always going to be\ndoing something with them.\nNAT: The first time I heard Nirvana, I knew that I wanted to be\nin a band. I was already playing guitar, and I really loved music,\nbut that sealed it for me.\nHave you got any other influences or idols?\nGARY: Yeah, I really love the Velvet Underground, 'cause they\nseem to be really cool, but they have a sort of unattainable cool,\nyou know?\nThis is the third time you've played in London this month - do\nyou really like it that much?\nNAT: It's good when people come and it feels like an event, you\nknow - there's nothing better.\nGARY: Doing residencies played a really big part in getting us\nsigned. We did a residency in Manchester, and it's something\nthat we really like doing... it seems to be a tradition that's been\nlost. So for the last month the Water Rats has been our gaff, and\nI really like that, I think it's cool.\nIf you could be any animal, what would you be?\nGARY: A snake, cause it's kind of in keeping with my Chinese\nstar sign. I don't know why I'd be a snake; I don't think I'd enjoy\nit, as such. I suppose it'd have to be a songbird.\nNAT: Good one mate. I was going to say a rat, 'cause they're the\nmost well-evolved creatures on the planet.\nGARY: Is that right? Is it not monkeys?\nNAT: No, rats are up there. If nothing else, they can eat each\nother and carry on, happy as Larry.\nHave you got a favourite book?\nGARY: Yeah, The Outsider by Albert Camus, that's a really good\nbook. It's a top read, so check it out.\nNAT: To be honest, I'm embarrassed to say I don't read. You\nknow when your mum reads a story to you at bedtime? I used\nto say \"can you stop please?\", and I 've not read a book since.\nActually I read one once; it was shit.\nTank Jess\n\n"

    "content": "reviews music\nSingles\nRoundup\nNATALIE IM BRU GLIA Wrong Impression\nThis is a wonderful piece of pop music from the not unattractive Ms Imbruglia (see pic above). Wrong Impression is the second single from her new album White Lilies Island, and it lays to\nrest any doubts raised by the rather average-sounding That\nDay. A beautifully laid-back verse leads effortlessly into a chorus so catchy that it's been stuck in my head for the best part of\nthree days. Remember Torn? Well, this is just as good.\nID Dave\nCHEMICAL BROTHERS Star Guitar\nThis twin k ly gem from the Chemicals drifts dreamily along,\nand is strangely optimistic without being joyous. A gorgeous\ntrack that is sure to be heard continually in room threes everywhere for the next few months.\nID Patrick\nACTUAL SIZE - Weights & Measures EP At the beginning, this Bristol band's EP sounds like \"indie-by-numbers\", with only the quirky Westcountry country and western vocals (see what I 've done there?) keeping its head above\nthe turbulent waters of mediocrity. But then along comes a fantastic Swan Lake sample, and the whol.e thing jumps out and\nsays \"hey you, I am much more than another shit Trav-play sailor clone\" in a big distorted bass type voice. Weird, but undeniably good.\nIO Ben\nLO-FIDELITY ALLSTARS Sleeping Faster\nDisplaying their trademark eclectic influences and general\naversion to being pigeon-holed, the Lo-Fis new single is here.\nWhilst not as strong as their previous offering, this is a single\nthat is proud to be unlike any other.\nOUT THIS WEEK The following are due for release on Monday 4 February:\nALBUMS CORPORATE AVENGER Freedom Is A State Of Mind\nFUGU Fugu 1\nHAVEN Between The Senses\nTEARS IN X RAY EYES - Half Life\nVARIOUS - FabricLive 02\nVARIOUS - This Is Not A Soundclash (Nuphonic)\nSINGLES\nBIFFY CLYRO - 57\n...and also the Natalie Imbruglia, No Doubt, Custom Blue,\nRound Sound and 90 Day Men singles (all reviewed below)\nNO DOUBT - Hey Baby\nWhat's going on? This is an interesting turn from No Doubt,\nmoving away from their sound of five years ago, or at least mixing it with something like R&B. They're not the kind of band that\nwould get stuck in a rut though, and after listening a few more\ntimes, Hey Baby seems to make more sense. I still cant say I'm sure about the somewhat interesting rap by Bounty Killer, but\nthe song has grown on me.\nID Robin\nCUSTOM BLUE - EP One\nThis downbeat mix of ethereal, icy electronica and more\nhomely acoustic leanings is a bit like a musical version of nouvelle cuisine: impeccably tasteful, yet strangely unsatisfying.\nAnd there's only so much you can put up with before you long\nfor a steak (or some AC/DC in this case). It's hard to actually\nfault it while listening, but it's difficult to remember about two\nminutes afterwards.\nIDDD Tom M ROUND SOUND feat ONYX STONE & MC MALI B UWhadda We Like?\nUK garage with a nice underground feel - a million miles from\nDane Bowers and the like. Up-tempo and bouncy, this is a well\nproduced track, and the vocals are delivered with slick confidence. I love the way they sing in their own London accents\nrather than trying to sound American. It has a nice dirty beat\ntoo, but lacks the substance to make it stand out from the crowd\nor earn a place as anything more than an intro track.\nIOD TomX\n90 DAY MEN To Everybody\nBad wailing vocals over standard Lo-Fi tunes start this one off\non the wrong foot, but then wailing boy gives up and everything gets better quickly. Once the brilliant piano kicks in and\nproceeds to dominate the rest of the EP, it becomes very easy to\nexplain the sound of Chicago-based 90 Day Men: just think Ben\nFolds fronting Fugazi. Nice.\nMM D Patrick a asaD Ben\n\n"

    "content": "1 February 2002 p The Student Newspaper for Imperial College\nIssue 1226\nDot Do yonge, or Vanilla? Mmr rB16) Fifth Sabbatical\nIt has been revealed to Felix that there is\nthe distinct possibility of College giving\ntheir consent to the creation of a fifth sabbatical officer position in the Union hier-arch y. At the moment there are four sabbatical\nofficers, the President, Deputy President\nof Clubs & Societies (DPC&S), Deputy\nPresident of Finance & Services (DPF&S), and Deputy President of Education &\nWelfare (DPE&W). The new position will\nbe along the lines of Deputy President of\nSites, and may also take over the Services\naspect of DPF&S. This announcement comes at a time\nwhen the sabbatical elections are rearing\ntheir ugly heads, and while any decision\nwill not be made in time for this month's elections, it is hoped that the new position will be ready by the Summer of this\nyear. This will allow a summer election to\ngo ahead, providing someone to fill the\nnew post in time to join next year's team.\nThe job itself would be to look after the\noutlying campuses, for example Wye and\nSilwood, as well as perhaps the medic\nWill it be? What will it be?\ncampuses. This would mean that the\nnecessity for a medic sabbatical president could be reduced, and would perhaps lead to the dissolution of this post.\nThis will certainly be a very controversial\npoint that will have to be dealt with if the\ncreation of this new post is confirmed.\nHowever, it is understood that both Wye\nand Silwood are happy with the prospect,\nand senior Union officials have expressed\nthe hope that the position would be filled\nby someone not from the South\nKensington campus.\nThis new system is very similar to that\nof the King's College Union structure,\nwhich has been seen to be very effective\nover the last few years. Sen Ganesh,\nUnion President, told Felix \"Given the\nrecent mergers with other institutions,\nthere is a strong case for expansion with\nrespect to Union officers.\"\nThe only problem that faces proponents\nof this move is funding, since it is very\nunlikely that the Union will be able to\nafford it. This means that the ball is firmly in College's court, and as such this\ndecision is only likely to be made at the\nhighest levels. The rest of us can only\nwait to hear the result.\nwill\n\"Notice words like 'teamwork' and\n'responsibility1. Ignore them. Well\ndont, but realise that there is more to\nt.\" Change The World.

    "content": "music reviews\nLIVE: The Beta Band\nOcean\nThe Beta Band. One of the few groups around who are willing\nto experiment to get the sound they want. No bowing to popular taste to get record sales soaring or to attract \"trendy\" collaborators for this lot. But what would they be like live? Would\nwe get four multi-talented musicians coming together as one\nsymbiotic being to produce a set so magical that the world\nbows down before it? Would we get four blok es having a freeform jam on stage? Or would we get experimentation to the\nextreme, creating nothing but a wall of white noise? Thankfully,\nit was the former, and what a symbiotic being they are!\nThe evening didn't start well when the \"guests\" promised on\nthe ticket turned out to be a comedy duo called Fat Russ and\nLes, who were supposed to be doing jokes and laying down\nsome tunes for the waiting crowd. But to be honest, a dead\ngoldfish would be a better comedian than either of these two\npil locks. The only hint of a snigger came when someone suggested that Russ was a less attractive version of Jonathan King.\nBut this was a price worth paying to watch the Betas in action.\nThe whole set was very well put together, and the stage presence of Steve Mason was phenomenal, matched only by the\nquality of the short films and videos shown on a screen behind\nthe band. The on-stage act was complemented by several\nscantily clad men and women (later identified as the angels of\ndeath) roaming the security pit with what looked like vodka\nshots (although it may have been water).\nHighlights of the show were forthcoming single Squares, performed with brilliant gusto, and She's the One, which finished\noff the main set. This final song allowed the whole band to\nshow off the full range of their musical abilities, as they seam-less ly moved around the stage swapping instruments while the\nsong continued unaffected. This real connection between the\ndifferent band members was a hallmark of the set, and was evident again when the encore finished with two of them on different drum sets and the other two on bongos, creating a perfectly rhythmic chorus of beats.\nAbsolutely brand span kingly good!\nLIVE: Cooper Temple Clause\nFeet First, Camden Palace\nHaving been completely overwhelmed by The Cooper Temple\nClause's forthcoming album [see review next week], we took it\nupon ourselves to attend one of their highly recommended live\nshows. And where better to see them than Feet First, the\nindie/rock night at Camden Palace...\nThe band came on stage in typical FF fashion, half an hour late\n(owing to the fact that the organisers had opened the doors fifteen minutes late - much to the disgust of the very cold people\nstanding outside). This was easily forgivable, for The Cooper\nTemple Clause were on top form this evening, banging out the\ntunes like nobody's business. They were utterly compelling.\nFrom the amazing power of Film Maker to the soft, crooning\ntones of Murder Song, The Coopers took the crowd on an emotional rollercoaster - one minute we would be bouncing up and\ndown, singing along to the electronic beats unique to the band,\nand the next we were almost crying at the beauty of the music\nthese people can produce. Definitely guitar music at its best,\ncombining the presence of The Clash, the movement of RATM,\nthe atmospheric s of Tool and the driving energy of Hole.\nUnfortunately for the band, not everyone felt as we did - there\nseemed to be a rather large proportion of the crowd standing\nwatching at the back - but there was a fair-sized mosh pit of\nabout thirty people or so, really giving it something serious\ndown at the front.\nOur favourites for the evening were Murder Song, Did You Miss\nMe and Panzer Attack. The latter of these seemed to go down\nbest with the crowd, probably because it was the band's first\nwidely available single. Their first two EPs were, sadly, limited\nedition box sets, with only a thousand of each available.\nHopefully, however, more people will soon get wind of this captivating band through their highly anticipated and highly recommended new album See This Through And Leave.\nIn essence, the definitive statements of this gig were the sheer\nquality of the entertainment, the almost magical tunes and the\nimmense - and much appreciated - effort of the band to communicate with the audience and make their gratitude known.\nID Tank Sajini & Jess\n\n"

    "content": "interview film\nIs there much sharing of trade secrets between yours l ves and\nthe let's say the makers of Final Fantasy or Shrek?\nLee Unkrich: Back before Toy Story there was a computer animation community. You call it a community when you don't make much money at it, instead of an industry. But it was definitely a community. It was an art form that had grown out of a science. And in the scientific world there is this sharing of\nideas, done through publishing of technical papers. In journals\nand in conferences and so on.\nThere used to be this computer graphics conference called\nCigraph, when I first started working with computer animation\nand it was the thing the entire industry revolved around. There\nreally wasn't much else. It was a place where every single technical advance was published as a paper.\nThere's still a very, very strong tradition of that now. In still\npublishing papers. We have won a number of technical\nAcademy Awards for the work that we've done and to win those\nwe had to share. It's impossible not to. So there is quite a bit of\nsharing going on.\nI guess as it has gotten more competitive, certain things you\ndo hold back, or you maybe hold back a few years and then pub-li sh. The one thing we're proud of still is Renderman, our rendering system and it's a prop that we sell and it's become standard in the industry.\nIn the last 10 years there have been 26 films nominated for\nbest special effects in the Academy Awards. 24 of those 26 films\nhave used Renderman. So whenever we make a new development in our own movie it tends to ripple throughout the entire\nindustry.\nAre there any projects that you need to wait 5 to 10 years to\nbe able to do?\nJL: In the early days of computer animation everybody assumed\nyou can do anything with computers. And then they try it and\nthey get into something that too difficult and it just doesn't work. So we're always aware of what it can and can't do and the\nlimitations guide it in that way.\nAs computers develop, those limitations are becoming fewer\nand fewer but there still are limitations. And, you know, this is\na business as well. You cannot take like 24 or 36 hours of frames\nand then edit your film out of that. You just can't do that.\nFinances won't cope. You can do some expensive money shots\nthat do take a long time, but then you have to balance them\nwith other things.\nComparing the subject matters: Bugs, Toys, Monsters..\nMonsters Inc. was very ambitious because the characters were\nmuch more organic than we'd had before. Bugs were exoskeleton characters where they were maybe organically shaped, but\nthey still hinged, and were a little easier to do. Same with Toys\nin that respect.\nIn terms of computer animation Pixar is going from strength\nto strength. Will we ever see an adult movie like this?\nJL: The way I look at it is that we make movies for the adults.\nWe just happen to include kids and if we make a movie just for\nadults we're excluding a huge chunk of our audience.\nWill it happen? Yeah, sure. Final Fantasy was starting down\nthat direction and I think that it's really a matter of time.\nThere are a lot of hidden jokes and references hidden in the\nbackground of this film. Would you like to point any out?\nLU: Yeah, the coffee shop, in the Monstropolis, is Hidden City\ncafe which is back in the little town where Pixar is. It was the\nplace we always went for lunch.\nPD: Yeah, and when they're trying to get rid of Randall at the\nend of the movie, he ends up in the bayou down in Louisiana.\nBut the trailer that he ends up in is actually the same trailer\nfrom A Bug's Life: Bug City is actually underneath that.\nJL: There's a Pizza Planet Truck that's been in all four Pixar\nmovies.\nWas it your decision to get Billy Crystal involved in the film?\nWe actually approached Billy Crystal as the first person on Toy\nStory and he turned us down for Buzz Lightyear. But as soon as\nwe talked to him about doing Monsters Inc. he said, it's the one\ndecision in his entire career that he regrets making to this day .\nWere you consciously trying to make a point about the energy shortage crisis in America?\nJL: We deny that the energy crisis was a convenient marketing\nploy for Monsters Incorporated.\nPD: We were doing the whole energy shortage thing and going,\n\"You know, are kids really going to be able to relate to his? I mean, the last energy crisis was, what, '78 or something.\" But, I mean, it doesn't really matter because the story works even\nwithout that for kids. And then the whole energy shortage thing\nhappened and it's kind of a coincidence.\nJL: In Monstropolis, there's a headline: \"Rolling blackouts\nexpected\". And we actually had rolling blackouts in California\nthis summer and even Pixar was hit with one. Everything came\nback up except our e mail.\nLU: Our email was gone almost a week.\nJL: You know, if you want to see a bunch of adults cry, just take\ntheir e mail away.\nDarius\n\n"

    "content": "feature clubs\nStudent Pugwash\nYoung people call for a rethink on national missile defence, tackling the root causes of terrorism, and including ethics in education.\nThirty four young people from Britain\nand several other countries met for the first\nUK Student Pugwash conference at\nWadham College in Oxford on the 15th17 th of December last year. In the spirit of\nPugwash Conferences on Science and\nWorld Affairs, we discussed issues of global importance, particularly where science\nhas an impact on society. These are mostly interrelated problems, or otherwise\nknown as problem at i ques, caused by\ninequities of various sorts (not just mater i al), as Prof. John Ziman explained in his\ntalk. Some aspects of World Affairs were\nelucidated by General Sir Hugh Beach talking about the declining role of NATO as a defence organisation, while becoming\nrather more important politically, and the\nprospect of eventual Russian membership.\nThis was contrasted with the weaker and\nmuch less visible OSCE. Sir Timothy\nGarden gave a fascinating overview of the\nhotspots around the world and the rather\nbleak prospects for the coming year; only\nthe European Union seems to give some\nhope to the situation.\nThree working groups tackled the issues\nof missile defence, terrorism and genetics;\nand more details about the conference,\nsuch as the working group reports as well\nas the talks, can be found on the website\n(see end of article.)\nOne of the working groups discussed\nthe potential negative consequences of US\nnational missile defence. If some sort of\nmissile defence system is inevitable, a multilateral (as opposed to US national)\ntheatre missile defence system was recommended as an alternative. This issue\nwill be pursued further and will be taken\nup with relevant decision makers.\nThe working group on terrorism came to\nthe conclusion that the root causes need to\nbe tackled. These are usually related to\ninequities (part of a problem at i que), and\noften pre cee ded by an arbitrary division of\npeople. For the short term, several suggestions were made trying to strike a balance\nbetween security and freedom.\nThe working group on genetics discussed genetic discrimination, cloning,\ndesigner babies, xe no transplantation s and\nGMO. It was agreed that ethics should be\nincluded in education, for example by\nintroducing courses to teach the tools necessary for ethical analysis and debate.\nOn the last day the Student conference\njoined the British Pugwash meeting at the\nRoyal Society in London to discuss \"The\nAnswer to Global Warming: A Plague of\nWindmills or Nuclear Proliferation?\" (very\ntimely with the government energy review\nbeing due.) Dr. John Hassard pointed out\nthe threats of global warming and emphasized that we should consider the worst\ncase scenario, as we did in the Cold War,\nmaking a case for putting in just as much\neffort and resources. Prof. Jack Harris\nexplained that nuclear power could 'para-do xi call y' help to reduce the threat of pro-life ration, as stockpiles of highly enriched\nuranium can be reduced by using them as\nfuel in civil reactors. Prof. Dennis\nAnderson, on the other hand, asked the\nquestion 'What's wrong with the alternatives?' and made a strong case for\nincreased investment in renewable e ner gies.\nThis first UK conference was organised\nby the Student Pugwash groups at\nImperial College, Oxford and Cambridge,\nand generated interest to establish groups\nelsewhere as well.

    "content": "club active\nFootball VII Triumph\nKings 5th s44 IC 7th s(42 to IC 7th s on penalties)\nIt was the game of the season\nfor IC 7th s a second round\naway cup tie against Kings\n5th s, a team in the league\nabove us. We knew we had our\nwork cut out, but we'd been\npsyching ourselves up and eating bananas all week.\nWe were up against it right\nfrom the start, Kings with a huge prevailing wind behind\nthem had us pinned in our own\nhalf for most of the first half.\nHowever, after they scored a lucky looping lob which Matin\nlost in the sun, our spirits were\nbuoyed when Matt created an\nopening for himself on the right\nof the box to smash home a stunning finish into the top-left\ncorner. Our back line was dealing with their incessant\nattacks effectively, but just\nbefore the break they got\nanother, scrappy goal. 2-1 to\nKings at half time, but IC by no\nmeans out of the fixture with\nthe wind behind them in the\nsecond half.\nThen, to our dismay, Kings\nscored 5 minutes into the second after Alex gave away a penalty and Matin was unable\nsave the spot kick. To make\nmatters worse, Gopal was then\nbooked for hinting the referee\nwas either visually challenged\nor mentally inadequate.\nHowever, IC's resolve never faltered and after Major Tom put a free kick into the far comer of\nthe net to make the score 3-2,\nwe felt we could go all the way.\nBut with 10 minutes to go - dis-aster! Kings went 4-2 up from a headed goal. Surely IC couldn't redress a2 goal deficit with 10\nminutes to go against a team in\na league above them... or could\nthey....\nThe fresh legs of Panu were\nworrying the edgy Kings\ndefence. After Matt made a Netball\nIC I3316 LSE\nThe netball 1st team is off to a great start in the UL U Challenge Cup, producing a convincing win against LSE.\nWe were without our usual\nkeeper Clare, who has a poorly foot as a result of a Reef or 2\nmixed with the crazy combination of a dance floor. Our\nother Claire, who can usually\nbe found flying down the\nwing, was our tallest option to\ntake her place and did a valiant job.\nWe got to off to a great start,\nwinning the first 2 quarters\neasily. Nice dodging in the\ncentre court between Jess\nand Ruth, and fantastic\ndefence gave the shooters\nplenty of opportunities and\nthey potted most. Defence\nwas looking particularly great\nin this game. Sooz, Kathryn\nand Jess made many interceptions and if not, got fingers to\nthe ball to knock it to one of\nthe team to get control back.\nStux came on at half time,\nwhilst LSE made a change in\ntactics for the better. Simple\nlobs into the shooter and a better flow through centre\ncourt meant the 3rd quarter\ndrew at 6 goals each.\nStrong attacking in the 4th quarter and a final burst of\ngoals from the IC shooters,\nBeckie and Hannah, meant a good victory to the IC girls on\nthe 1st stop to winning the\ncup final.\nsuperb turn on the edge of the\nbox to loop the ball across the\nface of goal, Panu ran in to head\nhome from a nigh-on impossible angle. 4-3 - there was still\nhope. Then with 5 minutes to\ngo IC won a corner. Major Tbm\nstepped up to take it and pondered the wind blowing into\nthe goal-mouth. Everyone then\nwent apoplectic as he hit a wickedly in-swinging dipping\ncorner which sailed over the\nkeeper and straight into the\ntop right corner of the net to\nequalise. 4-4 at full time. Thus,\nextra time reared its ugly, lactic\nacid-filled head.\nFor the next half hour, both\nteams went all out to fight\nagainst fatigue and get the\nvital decider. Some stalwart\ndefending by Chris and Andy,\nthrowing themselves at everything spherical in sight,\nensured we didn't concede.\nAfter 120 minutes of football,\nthe tie had gone to penalties.\nFive plucky lads put themselves forward to take the\nkicks with IC kicking first. Panu\nstepped up and put his penalty\nover the bar but was relieved\nwhen his Kings counterpart\ndid likewise moments later.\nAndy then coolly put his kick\ninto the top right corner and IC\ncheered when the next Kings\ntaker put his wide. Gopal and\nAndrea nonchalantly put there\npenalties away like it was almost a chore but their Kings\ncounterparts were also successful.32 to IC with one\nround to go, if we scored the\nnext one we had won. The\nMajor calmly placed the ball on\nthe spot and stroked it home\ninto the top left corner.\nVictory for IC 7th s, merriment\nensued and bodily fluids were\nexchanged to celebrate the\ngreatest giant-killing since\nYounis Huthhart kicked\nNightshade's arse on\nGladiators.\nLive sport\non the BIG SCREEN\nFriday 1st Feb (rugby league)\nBradford Bulls v Newcastle knights 7.30pm Saturday 2nd Feb.\nDerby v Tottenham 12pm France v Italy (6 Nations) 2pm Scotland v England (6N)4 pm Hibernian v Celtic 5.35pm Sunday 3 rd Feb.

    "content": "back talk\nuntil 1st March.\nTo say that \"lovers of art...are denied the\nenjoyment of a hobby that many other\ninstitutions take for granted\" is clearly a gross exaggeration.\nAll the theatres, galleries and cinemas\nin London offer student discounts. All it\nrequires is a little research, which ArtSoc\nare clearly unwilling to undertake, as to\nhow to get these discounts. I regularly\nattend theatre in the west end, both independently and as a member of the\nDramatic Society at a fraction of full price\nby using websites such as\nlast minute. com and ticket master, amongst others.\nI was one of the people who voted\nagainst ArtSoc being given the budget\nthey requested, and it was for a simple\nreason; the money the union has should\nbe allocated to societies to allow students\nto do something they would not otherwise be able to do.\nOnce you justify spending money on\nstudents going to the theatre, you also\nhave to fund attendance at Twickenham,\nLord's, and any of the Premiership football\ngrounds in the capital. This would reduce\nthe money available for everyone and\nhence prevents students from taking part\nin the activities they enjoy so much, perhaps the first or only time they may have\nthis opportunity.\nArtSoc still receives some funding to\nbuy tickets as well as provision for publicity and affiliation to the National\nTheatre and Royal Opera House, and has\nthe full use and support of the union like\nany other society. ICU Council rejected\ntheir budget appeal on 3 separate occasions over 2 academic years. This sounds\nlike a democratically fair decision to me.\nYours sincerely, Gus Paul\nChairman, ICU Arts & Entertainments\nBoard\nReconciliation\nDear Felix,\nAfter the Sept 11th, the world condemned such terrorists' acts and Bush\ndeclared war and retaliated ferociously\nand apparently \"legitimately\" conforming\nto the Geneva Convention. But haven't the Americans declared war on everyone\nand everything only in the interests of the\npoliticians?\nIn the 50s, the United States imagined\nthey were under serious threats from this\nvirtual enemy, communism. Joseph R. McCarthy, possibly the greatest demagogue in the history of America, convinced the country Communism as the\nsupreme evil of wickedness. The\nAmericans even blamed their domestic\ndrugs problems to the rice-growing\nChina. Being paranoid about this imaginary \"domino effect\" in Far East Asia,\ntroops were sent to fight against this\nharmless old man - Ho Chi Minh. Under\nmass media, educated students started\ndemonstration against such futile war.\nArmy was instructed to stop the riots\nand students were killed on numerous\ncircumstances.\nNow, in the war against terror, they\ndecided to persecute Muslims or any Al Quaida related culprits. The United\nStates arrested them all over the world\nand claimed the captives from\nAfghanistan are detainees not prisoners\nof war (an excuse to defend themselves\nto be in line with the Geneva Protocols).\nWorse of all, interrogate them without\nany legal representatives. The US attorney is digging out any dirt possibly to try\nthem in the federal courts. Isn't it similar\nto McCarthyism?\nHow many wars do you have to start?\nAnd how many have you won? This socalled democratic country with all sorts\nof freedom and human rights contradicts\nto the reality utterly and has no privileges to judge the world. America is a pitiful and ridiculous country ever invented by mankind. What they need in the\nCongress is a round table to allow the\npoliticians to change sides with ease.\nThese historical facts encapsulate the\nAmericans attempt to create this greenhouse environment hoping to protect\nthemselves by sparking off wars that\nshould never been declared. All these\nproblems indeed have their roots and are\nnot easy to be resolved. But Bush, a piece\nof an advice, not only listen to your mother about your eating habits but also listen\nto your conscience when a little boy in\nAfghanistan just lost his leg and his family because of you. May be that is what\nthe United States need, a two face hypocrite, to be there leader. Lets pray that\nAfghanistan will be a better place after\nthe downfall of the Taliban. Two words:\nReconciliation and Respect.\nNon Events\nDear Felix,\nWhy is it that last friday when it was\n'k andy' that the music was utterly crap, I quite happily go to dance clubs and generally have a good time but the music\nthat was played was crap and at the end\nthere were all of 7 people to kick out. I accept that dance music is not to every-one's taste but surely it would be better\nif, instead of playing random stuff that\nnobody has ever heard and only people\nwho really like that sort of thing will stay\nand listen to, you played commercial\ntrance and house, so that even people\nwho aren'ta great fan can at least have a dance and enjoy themselves especially\nwhen they have had a few.\nMoreover, I thought that the UD H was\nsupposed to be a chill out room where\npeople can sit down with there mates\nand have a few cocktails and have inoffensive music in the background, but it\nseems that the DJ's and the ents manager seem to think that putting breakbeat\nand house up there will make people\nwant to go and sit in there. Umm perhaps\npeople need there head examined but\nduring my first year you generally could-n't find a chair and had to sit where there\nwas space and there was a good atmosphere in there with just nice chilled out\ninoffensive music playing in the back-ground, where as now the bar staff think\nits busy if there is ten people in there me\nthinks a rethink is needed.\nAlso when the event is dance music in\ndB's why play dance music in the UD H as\nwell this seems foolish as people who\ndon't like dance won't pay money to come\nhere and probably just go to Southside.\nWhy do people still think karaoke is\ngood fun - it only works if there are\nAmericans or Japanese businessmen do\nit so why have it in the union especially\non a thursday night it just doesn't work.\nRant over, enjoy, fred and wilma\nHello fred and wilma (if those are your\nreal names). I have been asked by the\nUnion to ask you (plural?) to speak up,\nand go and complain personally. The\nUnion does actually want feedback on it's services, so they probably won't flay you\nalive for going to talk to them about all\nthis. So do. Or suffer in anonymity. It's your choice.\n\n"

    "content": "club active\nFrom Soho To The Caves Of Boho\nIt all began with a quick email\non Tuesday afternoon; \"I'm going to Fermanagh this\nweekend. Do you want to\ncome?\", asked Hugh Penney,\nan IC3 member currently\nstudying in Glasgow. I quickly\nchecked all flight options, and\nbooked myself onto the 17:30\nto Dublin, where Jerry, an ex-IC student now working in\nDublin, would pick me up en\nroute to Fermanagh. I packed\nmy helmet, light, wetsuit, and\n45m of rope; and off I went.\nJerry was waiting outside the\nairport when I arrived, and we\nwere soon zooming north\nthrough the Meath countryside - the slight delay in leaving Heathrow making sure we\nmissed the Friday evening\nrush.\nWe arrived in the village of\nBoho, roughly ten miles outside Enniskillen at around\n22:00, just as Hugh and his\nflat mate Dave pulled up in\ntheir hire-car. Our contact,\nSean was already in the local,\nMcKenzie's, so we joined him\nfor some of the best Guinness\nyou're likely to taste. It wasn't until many hours later that we\nmanaged the five minute stroll\nto our accommodation in the\nluxurious Boho community\ncentre. Caving huts are rarely\nplush, some are barely habit-able, in contrast, this place\nwas a veritable mansion.\nNext morning, we woke to\nan overcast sky - good weather in these parts. After a big\ngreasy cavers breakfast we\nset off to our first cave -Marble Arch. Marble Arch caves are tourist show-caves\non the edge of Cuilcagh\nMountain. Our plan was to\nexplore beyond the show\ncave, and hopefully make it to\na beautiful passage called\nLegnabrocky Way. It took us a few attempts to locate the correct entrance, Sean then led us\nthrough an easy squeeze to\nthe gated cavers route to the\ntourist section of the cave. The\nshow cave is only open to the\npublic during the summer\nmonths, so we were free to\nexplore it ourselves, however,\nour only light came from our\nhead-torches. At the end of\nthe show-cave, a tall, wide\npassage filled with ever deepening water leads to a sump\nthat is only passable by\ndivers. We waded across the\nstream to enter the sump\nbypass -1 was glad of my wetsuit at this point, but as soon\nas we started squeezing uphill\ninto the bypass passage I slowly started to steam. The\ntight passage involved much\nscrambling over and under\nrocks until we eventually\nbroke back into the main\nstream way, this time\nupstream of the sump. I was\nglad of the opportunity to cool\ndown, wallowing around in\ndeep water again, while the\nothers marvelled at the amazing marble passage wall. This\nmassive stream passage\nended in another sump, this\ntime without a dry bypass. We\nturned off into a smaller tributary passage containing a trickle of water. This section of\ncave, Legnabrocky Way, is\nwell known for containing\nbeautiful stalactites and mud\nformations. The passage is big\nenough to walk along easily,\neven Jerry, at six foot six inch-es, didn't have to stoop. We\nsoon came across an area of\nmud formations taped off by\nthe Speleological Union of\nIreland as a conservation\nmeasure. Unfortunately, someone had trampled over the\narea and destroyed much of\nthe passage. However, there\nwere still pristine white straw\nstalactites in the roof, and a small amazing chamber covered in flow stone and stalagmites We proceeded onwards\nthrough the wet wriggle, a flat-out crawl in a bit of water\n- wetsuit territory. Luckily,\nthis wriggle was only one\nmetre long, and we were back\ntramping up the passage in no\ntime. We ended up in a small\nchamber where a climb leads\nto a dig - local cavers trying to\nextend the system. Bands of\ndeposited mud on the wall\nmap the climate going back\nthousands of years, a black\nband of carbon showing when\nthe land had been cleared for\nfarming by prehistoric man\nburning trees.\nAt this point we were about\ntwo hours from the entrance\nand it was time to turn\naround. The journey back\nseemed quicker, even the wet\nwriggle appeared easier. Back\nat the main tourist cave again,\nI wasn't quite ready to leave.\nThose of you who have been to\nMarble Arch caves will know\nthat the entrance involves a boat ride along a canal before\ndry land is reached. I couldn't resist the opportunity to have\na nice long swim in this canal,\nwith only Hugh in his surfing\nwetsuit daring to come with\nme.\nOn the surface, we changed\ninto our dry clothes quickly as\na light drizzle began to fall.\nAlthough the cave and the hut\nwere in the North, the quickest route between them\ninvolved a brief visit to the\nSouth. We' took advantage of\nthis to stock up on petrol and\ncigarettes, followed by a quick\nvisit to Frank Eddie's pub\nbefore heading home for a massive chilli. Needless to\nsay, another night was spent\nsampling Ireland's finest in\nMcKenzie's. Sunday morning brought\nmuch better weather - the sun\nactually shone! After a rather\nlazy breakfast, we quickly\nchanged into our gear for a visit to Boho caves - just\nacross the road from the hut.\nBoho caves are a complex\nlabyrinth of passages in a thin\nbedding of limestone. We following the Main Drain, a large\ndry passage that quickly fills\nto the roof in flood. Our intended route went north to the\nsmaller Formation Chamber,\nbut we found that the connecting passage had been filled to\nthe roof with mud by a previous flood. Instead we explored\nthe short Virgin Circuit, before\nheading over to Coolarkin\nCave in the back of Sean's van.\nCoolarkin Cave enters the\nhillside at the bottom of a fifteen metre shake hole. A small\nstream enters the shake hole via a waterfall, and then flows\nthrough the cave. The\nentrance is a massive train-tunnel sized passage - proper\nSunday caving. We followed\nthis for about two hundred\nmetres to where an impassable collapse had occurred.\nVarious people had tried to dig\ntheir way through, but failed.\nThe water from the cave\nemerges after two kilometres -a potentially huge system. We\nsuggested to Sean that he\nbring a JCB down to clear the\nchoke - the cave is certainly\nbig enough!\nAfter these two brief trips, it\nwas back to the hut to tidy up,\nthen up to Sean's house where\nhis wife had prepared soup for\nus. We were on the road by\n4:30, reaching Dublin in time\nfor my 7:30 flight to London.\nWith great caving, and even\nbetter hospitality, I'm sure\nwe'll be back in Fermanagh\nsoon.\nIf you're interested in joining\nthe caving club, or maybe just\nwant to try caving once, contact the club on\ncaving@ic.ac.uk, or check out\nwww. su.ic. ac.uk/caving.\n\n"

    "content": "LE Q Dear Will,\nI find Professor Rawlings' logic in his\nletter to Felix in a previous issue absolutely flawed. He reasons that because the\nhacking (sic) of the LE Q website could be\nconstituted to be forbidden under paragraph 12 of the Regulations for Students,\nthe website was therefore \"robust and\nwas not successfully hacked\". This is akin\nto arguing that I need not lock the door to\nmy house because theft is illegal. What\ntwo students from the Department of\nComputing showed was that anyone had\nthe potential to access and modify sensitive information on the website. The system could in no way, therefore, be considered secure, nor robust. The students\nhave repeatedly asserted they contacted\nthose responsible for running the site\nabout security holes that were found during the pilot, but no action was taken.\nProf. Rawlings also complains about the\npoor response to the program. I believe\nthis was due not only to student apathy\nas identified by Felix, but also due to fears\namongst students that the data that they\nentered would not be kept private. It\ndoesn't take a Computing student to figure out that e mailing plain text passwords to everyone is a bad thing. Why\ncouldn't students use the same username\nand password used to access all of the\nCollege's other computing facilities? To\nadd insult to injury, the website was not\nrun from a secure server and so all data\nentered, including passwords, was transmitted unencrypted.\nI agree with the view that that the students from DoC are being made scape-goats, in order for the College to save\nface. It's time that the College admitted\nits mistakes and worked with students to\ndevelop a more secure and robust system\next time around.\nLE Q2 Here are the points which I passed up the\nhierarchy.\n-START--1: The site does not use SSL security\nwhich means that everyone can easily\nread all data sent between the site and\nmyself.\n2: On my personal page there are no\nentries for two lecturers whose course\nwas taken by the majority of the third\nyear.\n3: There are entries for lecturers whose\ncourses I did not attend, which means of\ncourse that I can give them a bad evaluation and severely bias the results.\n4: While the course code for me is cor-rect, the course name is incorrect, I am\ndoing 1\nComputing (Software\nEngineering)' and not Computing\n(Artificial Intelligence)'\n5: The email address given at the bottom of the pages for us to send comments\nto is not valid, and generated a bounce\nmessage when I tried to use it.\n6: Needing to offline the database for\nbackup purposes is unbelievably stupid -no commercial system has needed that\nfor over 10 years.\nTo pre-emp t the standard answer to my\nobjection 1:\nSwitched networks do not guarantee\nsecurity, they merely make it more difficult to snoop. Since all traffic is snooped\nsomewhere, for security or statistical\nanalysis purposes, this means that it is\ncertainly possible for someone to know\nwhat I said.\nI personally feel that the paper-based\nsystem was much better for students, and\nwas far more representative - only polling\nthose students who bother to attend at\nleast one lecture seems sensible...\nRegards, Philip Willoughby\nLE Q3 Dear Felix,\nWell, I had a brief look at the LE Q system (I was asked to) many months before\nit went into production. And it was a joke\n- the system was riddled with holes and\nsome very smart students in the\nDepartment of Computing gave some\nvery good advice that wasn't acted upon.\nThis beta test, it might be noted, was significantly before the actual usage of the\nLE Q system, and there was not another\none before rolling it out, to demonstrate\njust how riddled with security flaws -it\nwas (and probably still is, just with a bit\nmore sticky-tape to protect it).\nI don't send any personal information\nthat I care about over unencrypted con-nec t ions, and for the college, or anybody,\nto expect me to send something where\ntalk back\nthere isn't even an attempt at due diligence to protect the machine, then they\nare having a laugh. Aside from this, the\ninability to use the system from home\n(other than by having to create a tunnel to\nuse a proxy at DoC), simply made it not\nworth doing.\nIt really does look awfully bad on the\nuniversity if officials spout such rubbish\nabout security - an insecure machine is an\ninsecure machine. The \"protected\" information was a URL. Gee *whiz* nobody\nwill ever guess that.\nHave they actually fixed the problems\ndiscovered? Is it going to be offered to\ncomputing students to attempt to break,\nand if not, why should I, or *anybody*\nelse in the university trust it to hold information I do not necessarily want to\nbecome public?\nI might like to note, that several times\nthe Department of Computing has offered\nto build a system like this for free, and it\nwould almost certainly be significantly\nmore secure. The fact that this, and the\neffectively free security auditing that DoC\ncan provide was not taken up appears to\nshow a supreme lack of regard for the\nsecurity of students data.\nBunch Of Arts\nDear Felix,\nNate Evuarherhe's column lamenting\nthe budget cuts to ArtSoc was a gross\nmisrepresentation of the Arts and Culture\nprovision at ICU.\nAs chairman of the Arts &\nEntertainments Board, I have responsibility for over a dozen different clubs and\nsocieties allowing students to get directly involved in theatre, music, poetry, art\nand cinema.\nThe college employs a full time Director\nof Music, has 2 orchestras, a choir, many\nsmaller music ensembles and devotes\nhalf the space on level 5 of the Sherfield\nbuilding to music practice rooms and\nfacilities. The Union has a dedicated\nConcert Hall with excellent facilities for\ndrama, band nights and film showings,\nperhaps the best in the University of\nLondon.\nThis year marks the very first Imperial\nCollege Union Arts Festival to promote\nthe activities of these societies to the col-leg e, taking place from the 20th February\n\n"
