    "content": "22 FICTION 14 November 1997\nThe Man With The Ten Bob Note - Part III\nA story by Buz Barstow\nThe course was prepared and the spacecraft\nwould be in position in a few minutes. All\nengines were prepped to escape the moon's gravity. The man was looking forward to;\nwhat? He didnt even know what he was looking forward to anymore. He'd stopped thinking about that about two iterations ago.\nThis would take some time, in the struggle to get home, that had cost so many\nlives, his own, the woman's and had made\nhim into a murderer, he had lost sight of\nwhat kept him going. All it took was fifteen\ndays, or perhaps only about two. It was-n't really clear anymore. What had\nbrought him here was of decreasing rel-e vance. The mission that he had been\nsent to the moon to accomplish had\nslipped into the past. He might as well\nhave not bothered getting out of bed\non the day he was sent on this mis-sion.\nThe asymptotic drive engaged.\nHe'd given up thinking about home\na long time ago, only getting off the\nrock that was now spiralling away.\nEven the odd feeling that always\naccompanied using the inertia less drive escaped him.\nThe man reclined in the\ncockpit seat. Out of a sense of\nduty, and of morbid fascination,\nhe surveyed the death throes\nof the moon through the optical telescopes at the rear of\nthe pod. With considerable\nenhancement by the com-put er, he could see the\nmoon beginning to crumble,\nlike a piece of over dry\ndough being needed by\nbaker, and the flakes spinning off to form the platter that surrounded the\nblack hole. It would be\nquite a sight to see if\nyou hadn't experienced\nit first hand.\nThe pod was navigating an area of\nspace swarming with\nviolent y energetic\nionized particles.\nAny electrical s ys tem, especially the\npod's inertia less drive unit would\nbe vulnerable to\nthis hazard. Put\nsimply, the inertia less drive\nrelied on a consequence\nof the unified\nfield theory,\nthat allowed\nthe unification of electromagnetism and gravity, whereby the drive,\nusing electrical components could generate a gravitational field to ensure that all of the contents of the pod were accelerated uniformly, protecting the occupants from inertial forces, allowing accelerations only dreamt of before.\nThe pod reeled against a shower of stray\nplasma. All the controls were fried. The inertia less drive was failing. The man would be crushed by\ninertial forces if he didn't do something soon.\nThe pod was still accelerating. No time to think,\nno more time. Was this the fate that befell all of\nthe iterations that left the moon? He didn't have\ntime to answer that last point.\nThe pod squashed, the man was crushed.\nAny normal man, who'd experienced normal\nevents would be off to leave the universe for\ngood, trapped forever in the black holes gravity\nwell. Not this one though. He was uniquely\ndetached from the normal stream of things, and\nthis area of space was similarly touched.\nThe pod lay crushed in a body of water. The\nman drowsed in the pilot's seat, as if he hadn't quite realised he was alive. He stirred, and the\nwhat remained of the playback display came on.\nHis commander appeared on screen. \"Now\nyou've landed I can tell you the purpose behind\nyour mission. It is to retrieve an artifact left\nbehind on the moon by the survey team. This\nartifact is believed to be of alien origin. Its purpose is unknown to us, but you are to make all\nefforts to retrieve it. Good luck.\"\nAfter that a series of displays detailing the\nartifact appeared on screen, and the playback\nended. The man hadn't had the time or the inclination to wonder where he was.\nHe did make the effort to look to the pas en ger seat though, where the woman, whose dead\nform he'd left in waste recycling on the moon,\nsat. She had the same calm about her that she\nhad when she lay on the floor, but was unusually\nconscious. She stared at him and slipped away\nfrom his view. He might as well have been back\nin the primordial soup on the moon. He wasn't though. The pod window was surrounded by\nmuddied water. The man climbed out through\nthe dorsal hatch. He'd given up caring about the\npresence of sufficient oxygen, dangerous organisms or toxic chemicals.\nThe world outside was like his home. There\nwere trees, grass, a blue sky, rain clouds, every-thing. He'd been given a second chance at life,\nhe assumed by the woman, whose identity he\nwas now having serious doubts about.\nHe was free to do as he pleased. Make all he\ncould of his new lease of life. Make what of what\nlife? He'd left that on the moon with the man he\nkilled.\nHe'd have to time to mull. On where he did\nland. It wasn't as clear as before that he had\nlanded on a moon. At least not the moon he'd been sent to investigate. It most certainly resembled it, but the computer didn't seem to agree\nwith that observation. He'd been detached from\nthe normal\nstream of\nevents, and\nplaced else-where, either for\nobservation, or\nmanipulation.\nHe'd have a long time to think\nabout the answers\nto those questions.\nSo, the tramp's ring says something.\nThe skin though,\nbeneath the dirt there's a once healthy tan.\nAlmost like the colour\nthe hills that surround\nBogota seem to go on\none of its worse days.\nNot a flattering metaphor,\nbut there wasn't much\nflattering about the man.\nThe man took a look at\nthe hills. Shit, that city\nstunk. Worse place he'd ever\nworked. Not that the environment mattered much to\nthe man, he could afford air\ncon. He could afford a lot of\nthings. He couldn't buy god\ndamn loyalty though.\nMake one small mistake,\nand they take it out of your hide.\nYour reputation stands for no th ing. You might as well be a rookie,\na punk with no style and a passion\nfor crudity. Just one kidnapping\ngoes wrong.\nFuck 'em. This one would go\nright. At least reputation had bought\nhim a chance to do his bosses a free-bie. He looked over the dossier. John\nForbes, Englishman, geologist in\nColumbia prospecting for oil for BP.\nPacked 4 bodyguards. Tough freebie.\nNo wonder they'd given him a chance\nto redeem himself. No fool would take\nthis kind of job.\nTHE END\nNext week: Bus Stop Blues; a short tale of\ncoincidence, matches and not having the\nright change. By Dennis.\n\n"

    "content": "14 November 1997\nSRN - THE STUDENT RADIO NETWORK\nFEATURE 11\nThe Student Radio Network\nThis year a new Student Radio station has been taking the airwaves by storm. Our man\nEd Sexton finds out more...\nIn a small road called Windmill Street, off the Tottenham Court Road, lies the Student Radio\nNetwork's studio. The SRN is a national sustaining service, providing many student radio stations\nwith a24 hour music and news service (provided by Independent Radio News - IRN) for when their\nown stations are off-air. This is especially useful for stations with a restricted service licence, as it\nallows them to broadcast when they would otherwise be quiet. Our own IC Radio uses the SRN at\nnight and for hourly news bulletins, and Kenny Green, IC Radio's station manager, is assistant station controller for SRN.\nI The Student Radio Network was started about a year and half ago by\nChris Gregg and other former student radio controllers. Its aim was,\nand is, to unite student radio stations throughout the country.\nHowever the project failed after 3 months, due to lack of financing.\nUnperturbed, the founders teamed up with private to provide a workable business plan. SRN is now entirely financed through advertising\nand sponsorship.\nIts controller is Roger Hall, formerly head of B1000, Brunei's student radio station. Although much of the programming is managed by computer (the CD player at the studio holds some 600 CDs), some live shows are pro-vi ded; for example, Fraser Thompson from Fresh FM (Edinburgh's station) provides a music show every evening\nfrom 11 pm to 2am. Session guests on SRN have included Rolf Harris and Space. The majority of shows, how-ever, are prerecorded and sent to SRN on minidisc. SRN hopes to provide more live programs in the future, by\nISDN links.\nI Any student radio station involved with SRN can, in principle, provide a show for the service - either the show is sent\nto SRN's studio via ISDN, or SRN pays for the show's presenters to come to London. The signal is sent to Winchester\nvia ISDN, and from there to Luxembourg, where it is transmitted to the Astra ID satellite: The station can be picked\nup over most of Northern Europe. No stations outside the UK, however are as yet involved in SRN. The station's controllers hopes to involve more of Europe through IASTAR, the International Association of Student TV and Radio\n(similar to Britain's Student Radio Association). At present, 30 stations receive SRN, providing it with an audience\nof about 500,000.\nSRN is principally a music station (Alistair Walker, from Fresh FM, is head\nof music) - it plays a music chart every night, compiled from playlists from\nall the subscribing stations. Subscription for stations is free, and SRN\nhopes to provide each station with some money back at the end of each\nyear, although many stations choose to receive new equipment instead.\nIn the future, SRN hopes to help unions that do not have radio stations\nsubscribe to the service by providing the necessary equipment.\nTo get involved with SRN you need to be involved with your\nown university's station first, but they do need people to help\nwith administration. - the station coordinator is Dave\nRollinson (from B1000).\nAny queries? See Kenny Green @ IC Radio\n\n"

The main selling point, from\nreading the box and credits, is that\nthe idea for the story was from\nSteven Spielberg. He originally\nwanted to make it into a film but\ncould not get t lie money. Instead it\ngot made into this very competent\nadventure game.\nI am the first to admit that I'm not terri bi y good at these puzzle-solving, walk around and work it\nhelp from some friends and managed to finish the game within the\nexcellent, obviously the story line\nwas good enough for the film that\ni \u00ab>\u00ab'\u2022'/-.. 1\n; . . .

The\n\u2022b wever exceptions we ie./ here\nyou did actually do r he required\naction but not quite ri the correct\nway and this was frustrating.\nAside from that minor quibble\nthe graphics are not up to today's standard but then the game is old.\nThey are perfectly adequate\nthough, with smooth animation\nand glorious animated cut scenes.\nThe sound is also excellent, which\nincludes a changing atmospheric\nscore, while the fully digitised\nspeech of all the characters,\nincludes the 'other' actor from\nTerminator 2. So technically as\nadventure games go it is on the\nvery good side so far.\nThe story briefly, is that an\narmy/NASA space blok e( you) goes\nup in a shuttle to save the entire\nworld (wonderful America!). Help\ncomes in the form of other characters in the game, one being a German scientist and a women\njournalist. Since when have\nAmericans ever used German scientists (Dr Strangelove ?). Well in\nthe end you arrive on a strange\nalien planet and the object of the\ngame is to get back home. You\ndon't meet many people, in fact the\nnumber of characters is quite low\nfor a game like this, comparing it to\nDay of the Tentacle for example.\nThe good thing about this is that\nyou get to know the characters\nmuch more. There is even an\nimplied moral about drug add ic tion! Most enjoyable, o David Morris\nBEST OF THE OLDIES\nWIPEOUT 2097\nPsygnosis Ej JJ Ml Half the games out on the\n1\n& market these days are just\na sequels, it is by no means a bad thing. The publishing\ncompany doesn't have to think up\noriginal names and game plot,\nwhile the programmers have an\nestablished game engine that does\nnot really require too much rework-ing, and finally the players get more\nfrom an enjoyable game.\nIs Wipeout 2097 just another\ndriving game rehashed from the\noriginal? Yes, but with new levels\nand easier to control anti-gravity\nvehicles, Wipeout 2097 is an\nimprovement and an upgrade on\nthe older model. Wipeout is essentially a racing game, and the rules\nare simple, slam on the acc el era tor, battle against other drivers and\nhead for the finish.\nThe game is not limited to driving around the circuit and avoiding\nyour opponents, as an assortment\nof power ups and weapons are\navailable to experiment on your\nopponents. Some of these include\na temporary autopilot which helps\nfor those tricky twists and turns\nand quake, which tears up race way\nand sends it down the tack as a tidal wave down towards the other\ncontestants. With 14 other drivers\nto contend with it becomes a bit of\nstruggle but the added weaponry\nevens the odds of winning. Each\nlevel needs a lot of practice but\nplayers of the original game will\nfind that they are familiar territory.\nThe first six tracks need to be\ncompleted before proceeding to\nthe other hidden levels, and there\nis an addictive quality about\nWipeout 2097 that makes play and\nplay until you have gained these 2\nextra levels. 2097 reaches out to\nthose who like serious game play\nand to those who like a thumping\nsoundtrack. It becomes a true\nenlightening experience when the\nfast moving objects and vibrant\ncolours blur into one another, while\nthe stereo sound finally locks you\ninto a second reality.\nThere are four different vehicles\nto choose from varying from the\neasy but slow vehicle to the fast but\nimpossible to control. Choose and\ntake control!\nAs with the original, the sound\ntracks include some major club\nnames Prodigy, Chemical Brothers\nand Future Sounds of London.\nUnfortunately the PC version of this\ngame (Wipeout XL) lacks these\nmusic tracks but with hardware\nacceleration the graphics is one up\non the Sony Playstation.\nLike its predecessor this is an\nexcellent game for all you speed\nfreaks out there. The current cost\nof Wipeout 2097 may discourage\nmost buyers but search around and\nyou may be lucky enough to find it\nsecond hand.\nMagpie\n\n"

If you liked\nthe first three in this series you'll\nlove this one. This compilation is\npacked full of quality tunes, ranging\nfrom laid back downbeat tracks like\nTim Love Lee's Starplay 69, with\nit's strong use of atmospheric als and a more musical feel to it, to\nbig-beat bass-line stomper s like\nFatboy Slim Vs Bassbin Twins,\nAaaw Shut up, this gradually builds\nup to a rocking big-beat style then\nsuddenly it's all striped away and a massive BASS-line takes-over, oh\nyes. This track definitely means\nbusiness, it Just gets fatter and fatter as it goes on. One of my\nfavourite tunes on this compilation\nis Environmental Science's, Nonsense Pt.3. This starts off with\nsome spacey sounds, then comes\nin a slow downbeat break. When\nyou least expect it, it picks up to a drum &x bass speed, with firing high\nhats, snares and bass-drums.\nCleverly done and very useful in the\nbridging the gap between breakbeat and drum &. bass, for those of\nCLUBSCENE - SINGLES\nDRUM Freebass - Oxygen * * *\n(Freeflow records)\nThis first release from the new Free\nFlow label has strong musical\natmospheric als behind a more\nbreakbeat-driven track. This is a nice break from the big bassline\njump-up style that is mainly around\nat the moment. Both this and the\nflipside have a definite old school\nfeel to them. For those of you who\nlike something a bit different this is\na must-have track. Out 1 Oth Nov.\nEskovah - Night &. Day/ Tramp\n* * * * *\n(Colour Stone Records )\nThis is one of those tracks that\nseems to work its way back onto\nyour decks every time you go on\nthem. Night &. Day starts off with\nmetallic-sounding beats and an\nexcellent large female vocal 7 coming home now baby, that doesn't sound out of place at all, in this\ndark grinding steeper. This is drum\n&. bass at its innovative best. The\nflip-side has a slightly darker feel\nand no major lyric and overall this\nsingle breaks the mould and re-sets\nit in it's own form. Out now.\nThe Prisoners of TechnologyThe Trick of Technology * * * *\n(Fresh Kutts Records)\nThis is a truly massive tune, everytime i have heard this played out,\nthe place blows up and goes crazy.\nThis is by no means just another\njump up bassline monster. It is full\nof fresh beats and nice twists here\nand there, more than enough to\nkeep you interested. Then comes\nthe breakdown with an excellent\nbig sample. Then it comes back at\nyou with that funky fresh bassline.\nIf this doesn't get you b rocking out\nnothing will. Out now.\nMulder - Don't Believe The Hype\n* * * *\n(Urban Takeover )\nThis one seems to have been\naround for ages blowing up clubs\nup and down the country for what\nseems like years, and final it's been\nreleased. With it's unforgettable\n'Don't believe the hype' sample\nand time stretched like nobody's business and fat beats and bassline\nthis is a must have for all jung lists. Out now.\nyou who like to play a more diverse\nset. Another track that crosses\nboarders nicely is Mr Dan's Snorkel\nStarting off with some nice Electro\nsounds and a slow downbeat\nbreak, then drops the fat chopping\nbeats and breaks. This one will\nhave your head nodding along\nbefore you know it. There's also\ncrazy break-beat action with the\nlikes of Terminal Head's Coma\nNova, and for those of you who like\nit a bit darker and deeper there\nDust Devil's Hooligan. Elite Force's Cool Like the Man has a definite\nHip-Hop crossed with Electro feel\nto it, with good depth of sounds,\nthis tune certainly is cool like the\nman. Jep Beat Collective's Attack of\nthe Wildstyle Beatfreak, lives up to\nit's name, again a nice mix of\nElectro beats with those freaky\nbeats. I particular liked the scratching on this one, nicely done, with\nthe memorable Back By Dope\nDemand sample, this is another\ntop-quality track.\nSo all in all this is very strong\ncompilation, I didn't find a weak\ntrack on it. The first time I listened\nto this compilation I thought it was\ngood, but after a couple more listens I realised I had been wrong:\nit's fucking excellent. Each track\ncan easily stand alone on it's own\nmerits, there are no cheesy fillers\non this compilation. Beats By Dope\nDemand vol.4 is a very useful set of\ntracks that all big-beat, downbeat\nand break-beat lovers/DJ's should\nhave in their record box.\nThis compilation is available in\na DJ-friendly triple vinyl or for those\nof you who prefer CDs, it's excellently mixed by Slinky Merlinky,\nwho incidentally compiled the track\nfor this compilation. No wonder\nthere so many storming tracks on\nthis one really, with the wealth of\nknowledge and taste that Slinky\nclearly has. Slinky is the label manager at SRD covering funnily\nenough big-beat, downbeat and\nbreak-beat, I can see why. To check\nthe man live and direct get yourselves down 'MARS' W l nearest\ntube Tottenham Court Rd, where\nhe co-promotes 'Underclass' every\nThursday. E MP\nRuffDriverz * * * *\n(Undisputed Records)\nThis debut release from the Essex\nbased label is a real storm er. It\nstarts off with the time stretched\nDon't Stop vocal, then comes the\ndriving bass drum, I can see why\nthis tune is being described in some\ncircles as speed house, due to the\nsimilar use of the bassline. I think\nthis could be the start of a new subsection of dance music, with Ruff\nDriverz leading the way. Out now.\nTailspin - All Massive * * * *\n(Speedfreak Records )\nThe first offering from this label\nstarts off with that typical 'Speed\nGarage' style (to coin a phrase).\nWith fat beats and All A1ass;Ve\nvocal, then it drops into a lush\nbreakdown, and a quite superb\nmale vocal ' when your feeling lonely and you need a friend, reach out\nfor my love, on it you can depend\ngradually building to a absolutely\nwicked echoing bassline. The more\nI hear this track the more I like it.\nOut 1 7th Nov.\nN19 Recordings - Ganjaman\n++++\n(Stone City)\nThis wicked tune from the newly\nestablished N19 label is again\npushing the boundaries of\nhouse/garage music one step fur-ther. With the excellent use of time\nstretches and reverse beats, with a fat, fat stomping bassline. With a strong breakdown and 'Ganjaman'\nsample this is a must have floor\nfiller. Out now.\nWay Out West - Ajare * * * *\n(DeconstructionRecords)\nThis track has been re-released\nafter three years, and has some\nnew mixes to bring it up to date,\nmy favourite being the Way Out\nWest mix. This one gets straight\ndown to business with a driven\nbeats and eerie lyrics, with a nice\nuse of scratching. This will be big\non the trance y house scene, no\ndoubt about it. With stabbings of\nbreak-beat to keep you interested.\nA nice and diverse track well worth\na listen. Out 17th Nov. Also look\nout for their album out now. LTLCl\nMP\n\n"

The ULU team\nhave always considered themselves superior to the IC shambles,\nmainly since we never train, don't take ourselves seriously and\ndevote our time to fooling about\non rivers, drinking, and having a good time.\nWe have always considered\nourselves the better club, for precisely the same reasons.\nFrom the first whistle, the ULU\noffence were obviously put off by\nSimon's magnificent girth, as he\novercame a significant weight disadvantage to beat them to the ball,\ndespite their span gly new carbon-fibre boats. However, despite\ndemonstrations of stamina and\nlength by our attacking paddlers,\nULU persisted in dribbling all over\nour backs. Our goalkeeper, Solid\nGrade 5\" Adam, did an admirable\njob of defending the delicate\nwooden frame of our goal from\nthe nasty hard ball, unfortunately\nthis skill didn't extend to also protecting the net as ULU kept on\npoking it in.\nThe game was refereed with\nULU's characteristic lack of bon-homie. However, in fairness to\nthem we should perhaps have\nrealised that there were some\nrules to the game, and perhaps\neven had a go at learning some of\nthem. Even so, a yellow card for\nOld Man Colin was perhaps a little\nharsh, since he was still feeling\ndelicate after the previous day's pub crawl around the monopoly\nboard. This state of health was little improved by the ULU paddlers'\nrepeated attempts to roll him over\nand force him to submit.\nULU came up front, over and\nover again; we were bugger ed if\nwe could stop them. We were truly\nstuffed.\nULU 15 -IC 2\nQMW v ICWAFC\nWalthamstow was our destination,\nbut the tube station was shut and\njust to further inconvenience us,\nno buses were running either. So\nsix birds minus kit arrived two\nhours late, with the kit and super-woman Freud later. Feeling sorry\nfor us, the opposition lent us two\n(shit) players.\nEveryone worked hard in the\nfirst half, Captain \"Pisshead-ani-mal\" commanded with her usual\nstyle, despite reeling from a head\ninjury and inability to see due to\nthe previous night's shenanigans.\nHelen proved to be a bit \"shit-hot\"\nin goal, Hacker Lyle was racing all\nover the place, Super-woman\nFreud fought in her usual dynamic\nstyle, and Vasso stuck like Vassoline to any attackers - taking a few\nbitches out in the process.\nThe second half and we were\nknacker ed. Young Scrubber kept\nmissing chances but then she did\nhave a dod gy ankle. Wee Marisa\nshouted and shouted (but nobody\nheard - a bit of a throat problem I feel) and ran and ran.

Chief of the\nculprits was The Mower who\ntogether with Hurricane \"played\nlike aw anker\".

    "content": "14 November 1997 COLUMNS\nI admit I know little about\nFormula One racing - and care\nless. But recently it has come into\nthe public eye in a rather disturbing\nmanner. The Government has had\nits first real whiff of sleaze.\nThe background to all of this\ninvolves tobacco sponsorship. Not,\none would think, Labour's favourite\nform of business, indeed it made\npolitical capital out of criticising\nTory links with it during their stay in\npower. The Government had committed itself to a blanket ban on\ntobacco advertising, including an\nunequivocal promise in their mani-fes to. In mid-October, a closed\nmeeting was held in 10 Downing\nStreet between the Prime Minister\nand Max Mosley, Bernie Ecclestone\nand the lobbyist David Ward. The\nformer two are the head of the FIA\n(the governing body of Formula\nOne) and the head of the\nConstructors' Association respectively. Mosley has the unfortunate\nfamily link of being the son of the\nlate British fascist Sir Oswald\nMosley. This is the meeting in\nwhich Opposition MPs say a deal\nwas struck to extricate Formula\nOne the blanket ban on tobacco\nadvertising.\nSo what are they playing at? At\nfirst sight this seems like a fairly\nstandard Labour sell-out. They did\nthe same thing with hunting - supporting the idea of banning it, then\ndeciding to kill off a bill which\nwould do exactly that - Mike\nFoster's Private Members' Bill. Their\nnext fudge was to ban it on Ministry\nof Defence property (a quick fix to\nplacate the anti-hunting lobby),\nresulting in the all the landowners\nwho hunt and lease their land to\nthe MOD promising to cancel their\ndeals, removing vast tracts of land\nfrom Army use.\nOf course suspicions were\naroused that it wasn't just a simple\nsell-out. Most people forgive\nGovernments for these, if made on\noccasion - the Conservatives were\nas capable of it as the present\nGovernment. As I had outlined\nbefore, it seems that there were\nmore sinister developments under\nthe surface. First of all the minister\nresponsible for signing the\nGovernment up for the ban in\nEurope, Tessa Jowell - a junior\nhealth minister, had a conflict of\ninterest. Her husband, lawyer David\nMills, was a former director of\nBenetton Formula (an Fl comp a ny). He still works for them as a legal advisor. Opposition MPs seized on this, but it soon became\nclear that she was carrying the can\nfor a decision taken far higher up -the fateful October meeting in\nDowning Street that I discussed\nbefore. One guest, Max Mosley, is\na member of Labour's1000 Club,\n(admission at least \u00a31000) a club\nenabling member to 'network' with\nparty bigwigs. Bernie Ecclestone\nwas reputed to have given millions\nof pounds to the Tories during their\ntime in Government, and switched\nsides to Labour before the election.\nIf his contribution to Labour is on\nthe same scale as to the Tories, this\nwould extremely grave implications\nfor a Government priding itself on\nits lack of sleaze.\nThis situation was compounded\nwhen Labour hid behind the rule-book, stating that no announcement could be made until Labour\npublished its accounts - in a year's time. They initially refused to say\nhow much had been given to the\nparty, then after some pressure\nsaid it was \"over \u00a35000\". When the\nConservatives played this trick,\nTony Blair demanded openness,\nwith complete justification.\nHowever he has found an easier to\nway to extricate himself from this\nentanglement in a move made on\nthe advice of Sir Patrick Neill, the\nIM new Chairman of the\nStandards and Privileges gM Ll Committee. He decided to fcW K hand back the entire donation to Mr Ecclestone, something\nwhich must have hurt if his contribution was the size that it was\nreputed to be.\nNaturally Bernie Ecclestone\ndenies ever trying to influence\nGovernment policy - which puts\nhim in a remarkably long list of people who contribute sums of money\n\"no strings attached\" but who seem\nto receive a kinder ministerial ear\nwhen they have problems with pol-icy. The sinister thing about corruption is that it is never there when a new Government takes the reins,\nbut it comes in slowly, as ministers\nadjust to their positions of power,\nand Government policy begins to\nbecome more restricted as time\ngoes on (witness the dying days of\nthe Conservative administration -any new policy statement would\nsimply be aU turn on something\nthey did previously). Corruption\nthrives in secrecy, and the earlier\ncash donations and meetings are\nmore publicised the better. This\npresent case seems to represent\npolitics and spin-doctoring, if not at\nits most corrupt, certainly at its\nmost cynical. Now is the time for\nthe Prime Minister to address these\nproblems, before they begin to\nwalk down the well-worn and slippery path.\n/ Hamish Common\n\u2022 Westminster\n. \" \u2022'Eye\nJI made my first ever stew this\nweekend and it was remarkably\ntasty so I thought I'd share the\nexperience with you.\nFirst of all 1 walked, not rocked,\ndown Electric Avenue (aka Brixton\nmarket) and bought I lb of stewing\nbeef for \u00a31.20 as well as a vast\nquantity of vegetables. Back in the\nkitchen I cut the beef into bite\nsized cubes and put them in a bowl to marinade in a pint of\ncheap bitter (stout is probably\neven better). This tenderizes the\nmeat and gives you time to get on\nwith chopping the vegetables. If I remember rightly 1 used a carrot,\nhalf a swede, a turnip, a stick of\ncelery, an onion half an aubergine\n(salted, left to bleed and then\nrinsed. This removes the astringent\ntaste) and about l/21b of mush-rooms. Once everything was\nroughly chopped 1 put everything\napart from the onion in an oven\nproof dish together with a large\npinch of salt, half a tablespoon of\nflour, a few bay leaves, some rosemary and the beer from the beef\nmarinade. I then fried the onion\nand the beef in some olive oil in a very hot pan just to seal the meat\nand produce lots of lovely caramel.\nIt's always a good idea to heat you\nspices so near the end of the frying\nextravaganza I added about a tsp\nof pepper, a pinch of nutmeg, a small pinch of ground cloves and a heaped tablespoon of paprika to\nthe pan. Gorgeous aromas! Then\nplo nk, into the dish with the vegetables, rinse the pan out with a little water and add that too and\nhey presto, it was ready for the\noven.\nI cooked my stew in a medium\noven, call it 375\u00b0F,190 \u00b0C, gas\nmark 5 for about 2 hours with the\nlid on and then 1 hour with the lid\noff to get a nice thick sauce.\nMmmm, it was beautifully warm in\nmy caravan.\n1 served my stew with some\nboiled new potatoes but it would\nhave been an ideal opportunity to\nmake some dumplings. For these\nyou need one part suet and two\nparts self raising flour and the\nusual pinch of salt. Mash these all\nup and add just enough water to\nbind. Divide the dough into king y marble sized balls, roll these\naround in some flour, place them\non top of the stew as far apart as\npossible and put the stew back in\nthe oven with the lid on for another Vi hour and there you go.\nAlthough mine was a beef stew\nmade with beer I reckon you could\nmake something equally wholesome with pork and some cider or\nlamb (even better, mutton) and\nloads of rosemary. As usual, it's personal preference and availability that matter, not following\nrecipes to the letter which\ninevitably turns you into a Delia\nSmith. Antoine\n* IP\n\n"

    "content": "LETTERS 14 November 1997\nthe only reason the\nCollege shits on us (ie the\nbookstore (again!) and\nlooming tuition fees) is because we\nlet them? Obviously, this is a wider\nissue than can't easily be discussed\nin such a short letter but 1 hope\nsome people (especially Freshersdon't be shy!) realise that there is a lot more at stake here than their\nwallets. We all have a right to free\neducation.\nAnon\nDear Felix,\n1 would like to thank everyone\nfor their interest in the article I wrote for Felix about 'Closer' at the\nNational Theatre - I'm glad that\npeople take the time to read the\nreviews. I have to admit that 1 am\namazed by the fact that people\nmanaged to read the article, as I myself found it a particularly\ntedious and infuriating task (just\nask the people who sat around me\nin the lecture while I screamed at\nthe mistakes). How anyone managed to grasp the meaning, or\npoint of the review is beyond meI found it difficult and I wrote the\ndamn thing.\nDespite the fact that I am\nWelsh I hope that people can\nappreciate that the article I wrote\nresembled that which was published in the loosest of forms - my\nlanguage and computing skills\nbeing competent enough to at least\nrun a spell check! The reason for\nthe number of errors has vaguely\nbeen justified to me, but it seems\nthat the readership of the paper\nhas been left in its ignorance making me look like some dumb, incoherent caveman who shouldn't be\nlet near anything artistic let alone\nwrite theatre reviews. (OK I might\nLOOK like some dumb, incoherent\ncaveman but that really isn't the\npoint.)\nI would therefore like to state\nnow that I had very little to do with\nthe review published other than\n. giving someone else the bases to\nexpress their artistic nature with my\never-so-nicely constructed letters\nof the English language.\nI hope, however, that people\nwill continue to read the reviews,\nand pay as much attention to any\nfuture contributions. If anyone\nwould like a copy of the original\nreview then please just get in touch\nand I would be delighted to pass\none on (E mail w. Williams\n@ic.ac.uk).\nThank you,\nMatt Williams.\nP.S.I hope that this letter has\nescaped the treatment that the\nreview received!\nDear Jeremy\nWe believe that one of Felix's primary functions is to promote the\nactivities of ICU to our students.\nThis year we have noticed that\nthere has been a distinct lack of\nreporting on the activities of non-sporting societies. In particular,\nboth Consoc and Labour Club have\ngone to a great deal of trouble to\norganise speaker events. To date\nthere have been two such events\nand neither have been reported on\nin your illustrious journal. We\nunderstand that Felix wishes to\nremain apolitical, but we feel that it\nwould be desirable for you to promote political discussion within our\napathetic student population.\nWe realise that you have\ncolumnists commenting on\nWestminster politics, however this\nappears distant for many students\nand our societies are aiming to\nbring politics closer to Imperial\nCollege. Surely this is a resource\nthat could be made better use of by\nyourselves and unbiased reports of\npolitical societies' events would\ngenerate interest among College\nmembers. An additional point is\nthat the more coverage Union society activities receive, the more\ninterest students will take in their\nUnion.\nWe hope to see Felix reporters\nat our next speaker events:\nLabour Club:\n- Tony Wright MP, 'The face of the\nRadical Centre' (December 2nd) Tony Benn MP, 'The one and\nonly' (January)\nConservative Society:\n- Senior Ex-Cabinet Minister\n(November 19th) Sir George Young Bt, MP,\nShadow Defence Secretary\n(December 3rd) Yours\nJames Radway (Internal Vice\nChairman, Conservative society)\nAshton McGregor (Chair, ICU\nLabour Club)\nFelix Ed\nIn the interview with Charlie\nJoint, CJ said \"BUSA will not allow\nany medic to play for I.C...\". When\nthe medics have become fully integrated with l.C and are as much a part of l.C as any other current\nidentifiable body, how can BUSA\ndiscriminate?lf l.C really wants to\ncompete against the likes of\nLoughborough in a national competition we need to pull on every\nsporting resource possible.\nThe hockey club is preparing for\nthis as we are seeing an ever rise in\nthe standard and number of people\nat trial, and so we are starting up a mens 4th team. I would hope that\nother sports clubs are looking\nahead too. On that note, if anyone\nout there would like to know anything about joining the hockey club,\nor if you come to trial, and have not\nseen your name on the hockey\nnotice board contact me:\np. bland@ic.ac.uk.\nPaul Bland, Mech Eng PG2\nI feel there a few points to clear\nup here. BUSA only allows students to play for one university\n(fair enough), so if ICSM register,\nmedical students must play for\nthe medical team and not the IC\nteam. The problem arises when\nICSM does not field a team in a particular sport (eg fencing).\nStrictly speaking, this means that\nICSM fencers can't play in BUSA\nat all. Ed\nDear Sir,\nI must respond to the 1CU RFC captain's rather bitter letter in last\nweek's pages [Felix 1096, 31\nOctober]. Not having seen it before\nFriday and having placed two rugby\nreports and a photo in the most\npro men ant position on the back\npage 1 was a little taken aback. Mr\nHarrison seems to have an odd\ngrasp of diplomacy. Branding me\nslapdash and lacking in professionalism is not the best way to gain\nbetter press and is actually quite\nremarkable considering the trouble\nI have deciphering some of the\nrugby reports poorly scrawled on\nbeer-stained bit of paper. The claim\nthat sports that do not interest me\nbeing sidelined is also quite fatuous\nas the issue referred to in the letter\nincluded football, basketball, cross-country, golf, hockey, canoeing and\nfencing. Oh, and a rugby report\ntacked on later (by another Felixer)\nwhen an advert was pulled at the\nlast minute.\n1 have appreciated the consistent reports from the rugby club,\nMr Harrison, but please could you\nspare us your petty gri even ces. And\nregarding the number of pages in\nthe CivEng then perhaps you would\nlike to come into the office and\ncollate Felix on Thursday evening?\nYours faithfully,\nSi [Sports Editor]\nFELIX GREAT\nDear Felix\nAs a long time reader, I would\nlike to congratulate the exciting\nnew change that the dynamic editorial team have undertaken with\nregards to music. 1 would like to\ncomment on the innovative column\nfor soul and hip-hop. For so long\nthe music pages have been\nhijacked by mostly obscure indie\nbands whilst soul and hip-hop have\nremained the much poorer relation.\nI know that independent music is\npredominant on campus but it is\nimportant in the days of political\ncorrectness to address other\nminorities seriously.\nI admire the style of the colum-nist, Milen, who does not seem to\nhave the artistic pretentiousness\nthat the other writers do. His/her\nbold phonetic style from the ghetto\nblends in perfect unison with the\ncontent of the material presented\nand I would not be in the least bit\nsurprised if the writer were to be of\na \"rude boy\", hood wearing, flash\ncar driving disposition as opposed\nto a respectable IC stereotype.\n1 hope Felix keeps up the good\nwork for this year.\nYours faithfully\nSanjay Sikdar (Chem Eng 2)\nThanks very much, Sanjay. You\nare by no means the first person\nto complain of 'indie fascism' in\nthe music section.

Mark Baker was asked\non IC radio if he knew our address\n- which he didn't, and was congratulated on this.\nTrue, Hammersmith hospital is\nlocated in the wastes of East Acton\n(the kind of area you only visit to\nmake you feel smug that you live\nsomewhere else), but this attitude\nis unhelpful to say the least. No\ncandidate has sent any election\nmaterial to our campus, which has\nas a result been only dimly aware\nof the IC elections. One of the\npotential problems of the merger\nwhich formed ICSM was the isolation of campuses like our own from\nthe South Ken campus, which\nappears to be occurring and should\nbe resisted.\nI would threaten a massive\nblock vote against Mark, but we\ndon't have enough students to\nmake a difference, and none of\nthem have the faintest idea who he\nis anyway! 1 hope to see the\nHammersmith treated a little better\nin future issues.\nYours Bill Hanage\nPresident ICSM Hammersmith\nPostgrad Association\nI had no intention of congratulating Mark on his lack of knowledge\nof the medical campuses (Radio\nInterviews, Felix 1097). True, I said \"Good\", but this was\nbecause I'd manage to catch him\nout on a question. Sorry to anyone who got the wrong end of the\nstick. Ed.\nDear Felix,\nJust a little word on a comment\nmade by Charlie Joynt in last issue's radio interview. It concerns his\neither misunderstanding, or skillful\ndodging of the question concerning the situation of the Christian\nUnion official status refusal by the\nUnion. Not to be a pedant on a past issue, as a representative from\nthe committee that applied for\nmembership (which was about two\nyears ago now) 1 would like to clarify the situation. The Christian\nUnion, does and always will accept\nANY person, whatever belief, as a member. In fact we encourage it\nand have discussion groups called\n\"Discovering Christianity\" specifically for those who just have an\ninterest and just want to find out\nfor themselves what Christians\nreally claim.\nFormerly, members had to sign\na very short statement of faith, but\nsince no membership was paid,\nwhether they were members or\nwas irrelevant (and still is), and no\nspecial attention was paid to mem-be rs. To enter the Union the C.U. was prepared to compromise on\nthis issue, no longer requiring this\nstatement of faith. We were not,\nhowever, prepared to remove the\nrequirement of our committee to\nsign a longer statement of faith\n(produced by UCCF - The\nUniversities and Colleges Christian\nFellowship - an umbrella organisation which supports all the university C.U.s around the country).\nDon't misunderstand that I am\nagainst the union's ruling. Formerly\nof this college, I was very glad to\nbe in a union with such a strong\nstance on Equal Opportunities (and\nwithout being too PC also). We\nunderstood completely why the\nUnion would not compromise, and\naccepted that. A warning however:\nneed I remind you how, in this college of Equal Rights and\nOpportunities, the gay society\nprior to IQ was shut down? Or is\nthat just a myth to frighten little\nsocieties that open their mouth too\nmuch? The reason perhaps, why IQ\nkept such a low profile in it's first\nyear (joined the Union beginning of\n1995). For those readers who\nhaven't heard the story : the rugby\nclub decided to join the gay soci-e ty, call an AGM, vote themselves\non committee and shut the society\ndown. With overwhelming num-be rs, by the Union's constitution of\nany person having the right to be\naccepted into any society AND\ntheir committee (by a majority\nvote), any small but outspoken\ngroup is in danger of this.\nThis would never happen\ntoday? So why has the Mary's block\nvote had such power over any election or college-wide vote? Not the\nsame at all, you might say; but isn't that a group of determined outsiders (who have different goals,\nand don't understand the ethos of\nthe Union) trying to get their own\nway and often being a thorn in the\nside of the Union? Incidents of\nMary's students overwhelming\nAGM's springs to mind. (Apologise\nfor any offence taken by Mary's, the Rugby Club, or IQ).\nYours Sincerely\nSmiley\nP.S. May I just say what a vile\ncolour the front of Felix has\nbecome.\nFELIX CRAP\nDear Felix,\nIn light of last week's issue, I feel that this whole \"Felix is shite\"\nthing needs to be cleared up. I'm glad that Jeremy Thomson had\nboth the maturity and sense to\nadmit that things arn't going quite a smoothly as planned. I'm glad I'm not the only person who feels that\nthe standards have slipped.\nEqually, though, there has been a marked difference in last week's issue (#1097). The orange tiger on\nthe front cover looks remarkable\nimpressive, it'd be great if that\nwere the regular look of Felix. Dare\nI say it, but it almost looks professional. Things just get better\nthough, the improvements are not\nrestricted to aesthetics. Felix even\nhas (gasp) a real news story on the\nfront cover.\nI feel that it is an outrage\n(shock; horror; someone actually\nvoicing a i opinion about something serious at Imperial!) that the\ntuition fees issue had been allowed\nto go this far. 1 think it's about time\nsomeone realised that apathy isn't the virtue the Union (and even the\nCollege) prescribes it to be.\nObviously, this isn't the same situ-ation, but one of the reasons for\nthe rise of fascism in 30s Germany\nwas basically because of apathy\nwith no-one being prepared to do\nanything. Obviously, genocide is a bit more serious than a few thousand quid but the principle holds.\nThe Union, and College in general,\nseem to pride themselves on being\napathetic (and to a lesser degree\nconformist), when will they realise\nthat these are qualities to be\nashamed of? When will all the students here wake up and realise that\nDeadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday. Letters may be edited for\nlength, but will not be altered or corrected in any other way.\nLetters may be signed or anonymous, but please show your swipe\ncard when submitting them.\n\n"

The\nonly thing that let them down\nslightly, in my view, was their lack\nof any original material.\nLast, but not least, came Dustpossibly the only true 'guitar group'\nof the night. Their pleasant vocal\ntunes (occasionally sung out of\ntune) and strummed rhythm guitar\nparts being enhanced by some\nexcellent choices of effects from\ntheir lead guitarist, Alok. Although\nfairly tight and pleasing to the ear,\ntheir songs did lack some of the\noriginality of Fold's and they also\nsuffered in comparison to he musical skills of Funk 'n' Disorderly.\nHowever, in terms of original mate-rial, they displayed a lot of songwriting potential.\nSo, by the end all that was left\nwas for the crowd to vote, the\njudges to tally up their score (which\nmust have been done half way\nthrough Dust's set as this is when\nthey left) and the winner to be\nannounced. The judging was based\non three categories: musical con-tent, stage presence, and perceived potential. When quizzed\nabout originality, one of the judges\nreplied (sic), \"I prefer a band to do\nother people's stuff well than to\nplay their own stuff crap.\" Now\nyou know that and if you didn't know already, the winners were\nFunk n' Disorderly.\nIt just remains for me to say well\ndone to them and well done to all\nthe other acts. Oh, and to thanks\nSouthern Comfort and ICU Ents and\nits manager and my family... H Mark Elliot (J+R Society Chair)\nL ast Friday night saw the long-awaited (at least for the par-tic i pants) Southern Comfort\nBattle of the Bands. This was just\none of the southern regional heats\nthat could lead ultimately to a place\nin the final and so to a \u00a3 1000 prize.\nParticipating were four examples of\n- Imperial's fine talent: Fold, Rekless\nKarnage, Funk 'n' Disorderly and\nDust (performing in that order due\nto a draw held earlier).\nAs is customary, the gig started\nlate with Fold's four members kicking off proceedings with their stylish punk/indie sounds. With music\nthat seems to be influenced by anything from 70's funk to Sonic Youth\n(due largely to the vocalist\njocelyn's voice), Fold are definitely\na band to watch. Always willing to\nexperiment, their use of backing\ntracks to provide some great sound\neffects and twisted samples com-bin ed, at times, to create an energetic and original set. However,\nthe band were clearly nervous at\nthe beginning which was not\nhelped by the annoying amount of\nmic feedback initially present. This\nsoon dissipated, though, and\ntowards the end, the real Fold\nemerged, po going and calling on\nthe crowd to 'funk'. The one thing\nthat 1 missed was their sublime\ninterpretation of Walk Like An\nEgyptian that they performed at\nsome of their previous gigs. All in\nall a competent and tight set.\nNext on was Rekless Karnage,\nnot so much a band as one man\nand a computer. Some might say\nthat trance has no place in what\ncould be seen as a guitar-based\ncompetition, but 1 would have to\ndisagree. Music is music, however\nyou play it. Although the tracks\nwere interesting and easy to dance\nto (after slight problems with the\nsequencer were overcome) they\nlacked the subtlety that is required\nfor really good trance. They never\nreally created a mood in a way that,\nfor example, FSOL managed in\ntheir early days (as Amorphous\nAndrogynous on the Tales of\nEphidrina album) or reached the\nheights created by the harder\ntrance/techno of the likes of\nThomas Heckman (DRAX). This\nwas also rather compounded by\nthe fact that there was a pause\nbetween each track and not a continual flow of ideas one into a no th er, as is usual in clubs.\nAfter the small body count of\nthe previous act, Funk n' Disorderly's seven members (con-si sting of a saxophonist, trumpeter,\nkeyboardist, bassist, guitarist,\ndrummer and vocalist) seemed like\nan overkill. Fortunately this did not\ndetract from the excellence of their\nset. From start to finish, it was\nalmost professionally polished,\nwith all the musicians displaying\nobvious talent for their chosen\ninstruments. Playing music by the\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT 14 November 1997\nMore hospitalization\nfor footballers\nICFCII St GEORGE'S ICFC V v St BART'S II\nWe had it all planned before the\ngame: let them take the lead to\ntempt them into a false sense of\nsecurity, and then wipe the floor\nwith them. Things went even better than we had planned - we\nappeared flaccid in all depart-ment s, and gave them a commanding lead of two-nil. Dan\nhelped one of their midfielders to\nthe ground after being tackled nastily from behind, but James the ref\nlet them both off with yellow\ncards. We appeared incompetent\nand frustrated, with an inability to\nfinish anything off up front: they\nhad fallen perfectly into our trap.\nWithin five minutes of the start\nof the second half, the worm\nturned. Felix slammed home a tan-ta lising cross from Pete, and the\nfloodgates opened. Our midfield\ncame alive and ran rings around\nGeorge's, sweeping forward and\ngiving the George's keeper the\nhee bie j ee bie s. Penetrating runs\nfrom the centre of the pitch gave\nSteve his chance to put one away\nfrom the edge of the box, which he\ndid with aplomb. Tony followed\nsuit, leaving their keeper floundering as the ball rippled the side-net-ting. Our destruction of the enemy\nwas complete when Steve struck\nagain from just inside the area. An\nattack of nerves struck our for-wards, neither of whom managed\nto score. If Martin's goal drought\ndoesn't end soon, we may have to\nhire a psychotherapist....\nA commanding second half\nperformance, despite five regulars\nbeing absent, shows that Dan's army continues to march forward,\ntaking no prisoners.\nTragically, captain Dan was\ntaken to hospital during training\nwith suspected ankle ligament\ndamage. Get well soon, Dan.\nICFC II 4 - 2 St George'sI12:30 on Saturday and IC fifths\nhad a rather pathetic turnout of six\nplayers and Jimmy (captain) was\nlooking concerned. But by one\no 'clock we had 10 fifth team players and a random borrowed from\nthe sixths squad. IC started badly\nand rapidly conceded two goals,\nblaming them on the wind, bright\nsun and general bad luck. But the\nfifths' fighting spirit showed\nthrough and the tide started to\nturn our way. With half time looming Kublai was put through on the\nleft. Fighting off a challenge from a defender and with the keeper\nrunning out to dive at his feet\nKublai struck the ball over the\nkeeper and just inside the left post\nto put IC back in the match.\nIn the second half Barts were\nbeginning to get frustrated and\nplaying dirty, but the fifths' gave as\ngood as they got and play raged\nfrom one end to the other.\nStaunch defending from Nick,\nMark, Dan and especially Malcolm,\naided by a hard working defence\nkept Barts from scoring and before\nlong Kublai got the equalise r in a goal mouth scramble. Both teams\nwere now getting closer and closer\nto scoring a winner with only lightening fast reflexes of the keepers\nand defenders clearing the ball off\nthe line keeping the score level.\nNeil could have scored but for an\nunbelievable save from their keeper and jimmy managed to stop\ntwo Barts shots that looked certain\nto score. The fast pace was\nupheld right up to the end of the\nmatch but at the whistle the result\nwas a draw, testimony to a very\nclosely balanced, exciting match.\nThe fifths showed their excellent\ncharacter and spirit in coming back\nfor a draw, and are now doing well\nin their league.\nICFC V22 SBLH II\nSt BART'S III v ICFC VI\nFollowing an (un publicised)120 victory over St George's111, the\nteam went into this match brimming with confidence. Starting the\nmatch off with our usual long ball\ntactics (well, we are the 6th team),\nresulted in a superbly executed\nrun-away goal from Banksy. Voices\nwere heard in the IC team suggesting a possible 13-0 win. These\ncomments proved a bit optimistic.\nIn spite of our technical superiority, St Bart's tactics of fouls,\nintimidation and violence 'earned'\nthem a21 victory. Training this\nweek will be three hours of\nunarmed combat techniques\n(taken by Chirag).\nSt Bart's III 2 - 1 ICFC VI\nShooting\nstars\nOn Saturday, 8 November, ICRPCs\nfirst clay pigeon shooting expedition of the year took place.\nNineteen members, many of whom\nhad never before shot clays\nthe coveted ICRPC wooden spoon\nfor the second year running, thanks\nto his special TATACEAP ( Throw A Tantrum And Call Everyone Ap**f) training programme. Anonymous\nIC shooters display their limp weapons just after shooting their load\ntravelled to Hawley to enjoy a full\nday's shooting. Scores varied from\nembarrassingly low to infuriatingly\ngood, with particularly good shooting from Ed and Rupert (bit of a surprise there). Rupert had the\nopportunity to use his new Merkel\nshotgun, It performed remarkably\nwell. Especially considering that he\ngot it for \u00a3 15 from some blok e he\nmet down the pub and it only has a three inch, sawn off barrel.

Anyone wanting\nto join the next trip on Saturday 18\nNovember should come and see us\nat the Shooting Range in the IC\nSports Centre on Wednesday afternoon or Saturday from 1 1 in the\nmorning. Everyone is welcome,\nregardless of previous experience.\nIt's grim up North\nfor hardy cyclists\nOn Saturday 25th October, 3\nmembers of the cycling club left\nthe smoggy air of London and\nheaded for Derbyshire to take part\nin the BUSA hill climb tree trial\nchamps. Arriving early, Kimbal,\nTarik and Rob drove up the course.\nAs the car struggled up the gradi-ent, the trio were struck by a sudden feeling of terror and a realization that their bikes were\nover geared. The climb was well\nover a mile long and rose over\n200m. Kimbal was the first off and\ndespite pulling his foot out of the\npedal half way up, set a competitive time. Rob was next to go and\nwas thankful for a light bike as\nbeing one of the heaviest of the\nfield put him at a disadvantage. A valiant effort saw Rob complete the\nclimb in a respectable time. Last off\nwas Tarik. His tactic of taking the\nfirst half steadily and sprinting the\nsecond soon went out of the window as he discovered that the\nclimb was a real challenge from the\nword go. Tarik crossed the finish in\n7:00 minutes, 15 seconds slower\nthat Kimbal whose time placed him\nin the top third of the field. After a complimentary pint in the pub, the\nthree headed for home.

    "content": "14 MUSIC 14th November 1997\nSINGLES\nm Prodigy - Smack My Bitch Up IP\nThe opening track off The Fat of the Land\ndoesn't fail to impress. The radio edit version\nisn't quite as good as the album track, but the\ndrum and bass mix at the end makes up for any\nevils.\nKill Laura - We Are Modern\nThe opener is quite a nice keyboard laced indie\nnumber, followed by a fast song called Fast\nSong and a slower one called Slow song. All very\nnice, melodic and obvious but pretty good.\nWildhearts - Endless/Nameless\nAfter an unimpressive/badly recorded, crackly\nopening track, this sampler grovels to the lowest depths of keyboard driven, overdubbed crap\nthat I 've heard for a while.\nUltraliving - Sweetest Pleasure\nHmmm. An acid jazz line backed by a drum bass\nbeat. With a piano. And a woman singing. We\ndecide on jazz and bass or drum and acid, or\nsomething along those lines. Quite good though\nanyway. Strange at least.\nSleeper - Romeo Me\nThank god for that, this single so far outshines\nthe last, that it's impressive. In other words, this\nis an alright rehash of Sleeper's more successful\nsongs. Lacklustre, girly fronted, britpop bore-dom.\nMoke - Desire\nA surprising song, as it jumps from a quiet intro,\ninto a loud thumping ch rous. And it's got a slide y guitar y sound. And its got backing singers\nsinging a melody. It's really rather good.\nRare - Killer\nThis sounds a bit like Portishead, actually a lot\nlike them, but doesn't pull it off quite as well.\nThey have all the trademarks, from bong y noise\nin a metal room, to whine y violin, but all in all its\njust a fairly boring copy.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Lambchop - Your Sucking Funny Day\nIt's bands like this that keep sixty's cop shows in\nbusiness. This sounds as if it could be the theme\nto Columbo without breaking into a sweat. Then\nthey had to change it all by singing over it,\nchanging it into background music during a Baywatch running sequence. Anyway, it's still a damn good song.\nCast - I'm So Lonely\nI'm so lonely - I'm so bored more like. The title\ntrack just mumbles along, saying 'I 've got to let\nyou know for a bit' and that's about it. The Bsides, are just trashy off cuts, that the would\nnever get away with playing anywhere. All in all,\nno change since their last single.\nDust Junkys - Nonstopoperation\nQuite a funky little number this. A good beat in\nthe background, along with some good jazzy\nguitar, make this a bit of a 'kicking' song. It's not\nquite Reef, but it's not quite Corduroy, if that\nmakes any sense. However, it is very good.\nTeenage Fanclub - Start Again\nA song with guitars in it. And unfortunately\nthat's the most interesting thing about it. It goes\non in a 'dum dee dum dee dum' fashion, for all\n3 minutes of its length. They should stop right\nnow, as they most definitely do not have\n'enough time to start again', in my opinion.\nHigh Coin - Sun Set Eyes/Orange Clow (double\na side)\nSunset eyes is a laid back lo-fi number, perfect\nfor going to sleep to, apart from when the synth\nhorns kick in. Orange glow glows a bit more\nthan its predecessor, with some impressive\nslide guitar on the intro, but falls down from the\nmoment the monotonic singers start.\nPortishead - Over\nA rather long and dull intro leads into an over\nthe top affected bass y thing, and some totally\nunnecessary and fairly a rhythmic scratching,\nwhich quite ruins a nice song. Not the best off\nthe new album, and not a good choice for a single.\nTony Hadley - First of May\nAny song which starts with 'When I was small\nand Christmas trees were tall' can't be all that\nbad in my Opinion, but this time I have to give\nin. The sleeve gives the address of the European\nfan club, probably containing all of two people,\nboth of whom are obsessed by his grimacing\nexpressions are as he pouts about a stage.\nUnadulterated rubbish. ES\nBilly\nCLUBSCENE - THE UNDERGROUND MUSIC GUIDE\nooo\nS peed garage, typically 130\nbeats per minute, has\nevolved from US garage, with\na notable crossover also from Old\nSkool (1990 - 92 era) and a larger\nthan life drum 'n' bass influence.\nIt has emerged in the past two\nyears or so, when US garage was\nbeing played out to various crowds\nin the London area. The US style\nwas seen not too have enough\n\"oo mph\" for the British, with Djs\noften pitching up to +8 before producers started to make it faster.\nHowever, it is really only in the last\nnine months that speed, or under-ground, garage has \"gone mental\".\nThe c lubbers in London have\nbeen seemingly growing apart from\nother forms of dance music, which\nmay be why this new 'underground'\nformed. It has led to those in the\nMidlands and Bristol also changing\ntheir tastes, wanting something\nnew, hence the spread of speed\ngarage around the country.\nPromoters in London putting on\nSpeed Garage\nevents in places such as the Leisure\nLounge, Power house, Bagleys and\nCamden Palace have finally realised\nthat the c lubbers' tastes have\nchanged, and the nights being held\nin such places are diversifying from\nhard house to speed garage.\nThe crowd itself have come\nfrom both the hard house and\ndrum 'n' bass scenes. Those listening to and attending the occasional\ndrum 'n' bass events had noticed a moody atmosphere beginning to\nemerge into the scene - speed\ngarage seems to offer both safe\nclubbing and a new style of music.\nThose into hard house were tired of\nthe ever increasing commercial it y, and wanted something new.\nThe c lubbers are renowned for\ntheir smart appearance, and this\nparticular music does not suffer\nfrom the pill problems that others\ndo - indeed, champagne drinking is\nmore commonplace!! The most\ncommon misconception with\nspeed garage is that of it being\n\"Gangster\" garage. While I would\nnot choose to mess with anyone at\nthese events, there is no sign of\nthreatening behaviour what so\never.\nThere are two main sides to\nunderground garage. There is a soulful part - Gabrielle's Roy Davis\nJnr is a good example - and a massive bassline influence.\nThe biggest worry at the\nmoment within the scene is that of\ncommercial it y. With major labels\ncategorising too much, splits within\nthe different genres is inevitable.\nNowadays, music is seen as a lot\nmore rigid - and those wanting a slice of the action on labels are able\nto react a lot quicker to new\nscenes. Already, XL, Perfecto and\nDeconstruction are in the process\nof setting up speed garage sec-t ions. This commercial side helps\nto make the music more access i ble, but there is more to worry\nabout. People are latching onto\nremixes, and these become do mi nant, leading to the possibility of\npeople getting bored of the sound\nearlier than is usually the case.\nWith the scene becoming more\npopular, DJs are also able to\ndemand more money for sets, and\nthis maybe a factor for future splits,\nas many of those who are in it for\nthe music begrudge those reportedly getting as much as \u00a36000 for\na set on new year's eve.\nAll in all, the speed garage\nscene is still a relatively new one,\nand while commercial it y can help,\nit is hoped that it grows constructively as opposed to fragmenting\nand splitting up into many other\nnew forms like other underground\nscenes have done before.\nNext week, there will be\nreviews from a speed garage club,\nalong with a compilation, 101%\nspeed garage. 13 Chris\n\n"

    "content": "14th November 1997 MUSIC 13\nALBUMS\nECHO BELLY Lustra * * * *\nTHE JAM\nThe Very Best Of The Jam * \u2022 * \u2022\nW may as well get the formalities\nI out of the way first. This album\nH is an absolute storm er! and I really wasn't expecting it to be.\nLustra doesn't have any energy\nveined tracks that a Brit-Pop fan\nmay want to request at a nightclub,\nbut it will be happily playing in my\nroom for quite some time.\nImmediately, 1 was pleasantly\nsurprised by the freshness of this\nalbum. Maybe the long break since\nthe last release from Echobelly has\nallowed them to come back sounding considerably less tired than\nwhat they may have been expected\nto in these Indie-band governed\ndays of British music. And when\nexactly did Echobelly adopt such a varied slant within this genre? - a trait that is sadly lacking in so many\nsecond rate bands flooding the\nlocal HMV with their second rate\ntunes.\nPretty soon into Lustra - in fact\ntrack two, I'm Not A Saint - the\nmemories of Echobelly come\nflooding back. Strong guitars, synthetically warped vocals, and their\nuncanny ability to sound just like\nSleeper.\nThere are a couple of tracks\nthat you could pick out as future\nchart toppers - well, maybe not\ntoppers, but definitely top-tenn ers. Bleed is a brilliant acoustic, and\nEveryone Knows Better is definitive\nfoot-t appin' music. In fact it's likely to induce foot-tapping in the\nmost hardened of anti-foot-tap-per s. Every now and again you do\nhave to keep reminding yourself\nthat you aren't listening to Sleeper,\nand whether this is a good or a bad\nthing is subject to opinion. Why no\nfifth star? Unfortunately the title\ntrack started to remind me of Bis.\nAnd I'd love to tell that sugar sugar\ncandy pop exactly where she could\npush it down and pull it up. H Derek\nT his album begins with the\nfierce debut cry of In The City\n- the template for the singles\nthat would immediately follow.\nStraight away we are given an\ninsight into Weller's anti-author it ar ian lyrics and the driving rhythm\nsection from Bruce Foxton and Rick\nBuckler. Songs such as The Modern\nWorld, David Watts, A Bomb In\nWardour Street and Down In The\nTube Station At Midnight show\ngreat diversity yet are all contained\nwithin the classic sound of pounding bass and drums, and detached,\nmelodic guitar playing.\nInterestingly, none of these\nsongs reached the top 10 in the\nUK. However, lack of singles chart\nsuccess did not stop them from\nbeing the best band, according to\nNME readers, as they entered the\n80's. This is where we are given the\nreal gems.\nGoing Underground sounds as\ncontemporary today as it did when\nit gave them their first number one.\nStart! is a great musical leap\ndespite shamelessly nicking its riff\nfrom The Beatles. And That's Entertainment is just sheer class.\nHowever, their singles soon\ntook a jump the wrong way. Even\nthough still capable of number\nones, The jam's singles became\nmore inspired by the dance side of\nrock so favoured by the growing\nnumbers of New Romantics,\npaving the way for Weller's ill-fated\noutfit The Style Council. Combining\nthis sound with their Motown influences their last few singles sound\neerily similar to Phil Collins' songs\nof the time.\nThere are still magical moments\nto be found on their last two singles (and hence the last two singles\non the album). The Bitterest Pill (I Ever Had To Swallow) is a ballad as\nmoving as The Style Council's You're The Best Thing. And Beat\nSurrender is probably the best song\nwith which to end a career of such\ndynamism and versatility.\nFans of Weller's recent solo\nwork will be surprised by how different his work is to that of The\njam. Give it a few listens, though,\nand I'm sure you will be pleased\nwith the result. H Ed\nSOUL, HIP-HOP AND NO STOP\nWhat up to all IC!! I got much love for all of\ny 'all, its that time again where I break it all\ndown for y 'all. Straight of the bat, Mary ] is\nplaying at Wembley arena tomorrow tonight,\nsupport from Chico DeBarge and the original\nladies man joe. All three are dropping new\njoints to coincide with the concert dates,\nChico's new album has just been released\nLong Time No See, while joe will drop his new\nsingle Good Girls soon in the future. Mary is\nreleasing the fourth cut from her album, the\ntracks' called Missing You and for once the\nrecord company has decided that they will\ninclude more than just the album version of\nthe track, in this case the So So Def and\nRodney Jenkins mixes both included. With\nMary's last offering Everything the single just\ncontained the album version (with in st rumen tal), then two weeks later out comes the\nremixes with the awesome So So Def mix\nblowing up all over, so a message to record\ncompanies - sort it out. If your think in' about\nthe Mary j concert and you don't have tickets\nthen forget 'bout it; the news is that almost\nall the tickets are sold and those remaining\nare so far back you'll see more by going to see\na flea circus; my advice is you save your\nmoney and get tickets for En Vogue. The three\nfunky divas will be playing Wembley arena on\nThursday 4th December and they should be\njust as good, personally I rated their album\nEV3 better than Mary's LP.\nPuffy this and Puffy tat - The Puff daddy is\neverywhere, this is a long running saga probably doesn't deserve any coverage but with\nthe lack of any real news I am going to\nattempt to relate my judgement on the Puff\nDaddy. Personally I'm a West Coast boy; I love the laid back g funk driven tracks that\ncome out of the west, so my view of the situation might have been a little biased, except\nthat I think Puffy is one of the do pest producers on the block at that the minute. Now Puffy\nain't just a very talent producer but also a very clever businessman (please note I left\nout any mention of his rapping ability 'cause\nit just don't exist), have you noticed that\nsince the death of Biggie (may his soul rest in\npeace) the Bay Boy Family ain't been out of\nthe charts. Puffy may have been sorry to see\nhis boy go out, but he used it to his advantage, to launch an assault on the charts\nreleasing tune after tune. Even now the Mase\nalbum be blow in' up all over tha fucking uni-verse, it isn't in the same class as Biggie, but\nhey its party tunes that will party so acquire.\nMajor tracks off the LP which are definitely\nworth a listen include What You Want with\nTotal, Will They Die 4 You a fast little number\nwith Puffy & Li' Kim and Love U So featuring\nwicked vocals from Billy Lawerence (dis girl is\ngoin\" blow up!!). A quick note on the new\nPuffy single Been Around the World a cover of\nour very own Lisa, you know this is going to\nbe having some serious play time a hit ? no\nfucking doubt.\nI know y 'all all want to hear what phat little singles are out at the minute, but for this\nweek I 've got a guest reviewer in, she's just\nback form the US and is here to tell us what's goin' be hot over here soon. IC radio's queen\nof tha mic GLORIA:\n'\"Sup y 'all! just a footnote giving you the\n41 1 on what's hot. A joint worth check in' out:\nthe Face-produced Soul Food soundtrack, more\nsatisfying than mama's fried chicken and sweeter than any home-made peach cobbler. Two rea!\ngems : Atlanta's finest Jagged Edge (of the So So\nDef camp, big props to my man, Jermaine\nDupri) hit you with The Way That You Talk and if\nyou though Up Jumps Da Boogie was da' bomb,\nthen check out Magoo &. Timalands Welcome\nTo Our World which is sure to give Puffy a run\nfor his money. For those into slow jams, 'Butta\nLove' by Next be your track, four b ruth as croon in' their way into every ladies heart, hold\nup isn't that a bit like Dm Hill, Jodeci, 1 12\nDats the DL for the mo' Keepin' it tight and\na 'light, til next week.\" Gloria.\nSeem that she picked up more than just\nsome phat tracks, anyway that's' nuff from\nher and enough of me, I 'll be seeing ya round.\nPeace and love,\nMilen\n\n"

    "content": "16 FILM\n\u2022WILL IT SNOW FOR CHRISTMAS?\nStarring: Dominique Reymond, Daniel Duval\nDirector: Sandrine Veysset\nWilliam Hill will not let me\nplace a bet on a white\nChristmas, nor will they\noffer me any odds on the holiday\nbox office chart. Nevertheless, 1\nshall put my mouth where my\nmoney isn't and predict that we\nshan't see snow and Will It Snow\nFor Christmas? won't threaten the\nsuccess of big Hollywood movies.\nThis is for several reasons; partly\nbecause it is a subtitled French\nfilm, partly\nbecause it has\nsuch a feeble\nstoryline( attempting a forecast to\nanswer the\nquestion in the\ntitle did not keep\nme on the edge\nof my seat for an\nhour and a half),\nbut also because\nthe characters\nare only mildly\nengaging. This is\na critical failure\nfor a film that\nrelies on our\nunderstanding of\nscreen relationships to explore a family's mutual\nlove.\nSpecifically, the film deals with\nmaternal love in a situation where a single mother lives with her seven\nillegitimate children. WriterDirector Sandrine Veysset evidently\nhas a great deal of respect for\nwomen who go through the trial of\nmotherhood, and even dedicated\nthe work to her own mother. This\nadmiration has, however, blinkered\nher own perception of the subject.\nThe main problem with the film\nis that all the characters are carica-ture s, so it is difficult to take them\nseriously. The children are too\nclever, too unrealistically obedient;\nthe mother so loving that she\nincessantly mollycoddles and holds\nthem. The entire film lacks subtlety\nand Veysset\noften resorts to\nstraightforward\nrepetition to\nensure her\nmessage gets\nacross.\nPerhaps these mistakes\nare under-stand able when we\nrealise that this\nis the director's debut. Dismissing the\nfilm outright\nwould be\nunreasonable,\nsince Veysset\nhas accomplished a lot. It\nis never easy to\nget children to act convincingly, yet\nseemingly natural performances\nhave been extracted from them. In\ncertain scenes, one even wonders\nwhether a script was ever written.\nBut, ultimately, the fact remains\nthat organising seven children for\nschool in the morning is my idea of\na nightmare, not entertainment.D Tom\nDominique Reymond\nwith one of her seven\nillegitimate kids\nLONDON FILM FESTIVAL\nLONDON\nFILM\nFESTIVAL\nThe 41st London Film Festival is\nnow well and truly under way. If\nyou haven't yet bought your\ntickets for the various premieres\nand gala screenings then you'd better act quickly as seats are\ngoing quickly.\nFor a chance to see a big\nHollywood film months before its\nrelease you could do far worse\nthan try The End of Violence. It\nstars Bill Pullman, Andie\nMacDowell and Gabriel Byrne and\nis an intelligent look at the issues of\npower and violence in the not too\ndistant future. It is not released\nuntil January 9 but is showing twice\non Thursday at the Odeon West\nEnd. Ticket prices start at \u00a36.75\nand can be bought by phoning the\nFestival Hotline on 0171 4201122.\nAnother film examining the\nmotives behind violence is\nResurrection Man. In this case,\nhowever, the film revolves around\nthe real subject of the Shankhill\nButchers, a Northern Ireland gang\nOUT NOW\n14 November 1997\nwho murdered 19 people in the\nlate seventies. They claimed to be\nLoyalist, yet their victims included\nfive Protestants demonstrating the\npurely psychotic nature of their\nenterprise. Directed by Marc\nEvans, who was recently interviewed by Felix, the film plays at\nthe Odeon West End twice on\nFriday 21 November and tickets\nare available from the phone number above.\nTwentyfour Seven is another\nBritish film receiving its premiere at\nthe festival. Directed and written\nby Shane Meadows, this sees Bob\nHoskins setting up a boxing club in\nan attempt to restore dignity to his\ntown's dissolute youth. We follow\nhis unwilling recruits battle through\nvarious trials, egged on by Hoskins\nin excellent form. It shows at the\nOdeon West End on Wednesday.\nFor a more international flavour\nyou could try a sample from the\n\"French Revolution\" or \"Facing\nEast\" strands. These are programmes featuring a variety of\nfilms from debut and established\ndirectors from various countries.\nMore information can be found in\nthe festival brochure available from\nthe Evening Standard Film on the\nSquare ticket booth in Leicester\nSquare. CI\nIf you haven't been reading Felix over the last couple of weeks, here\nis the best of what's showing now:\nFace/Off\nJohn Travolta and Nicolas Cage send each other up in this face-swapping\nthriller. Unmissable if you're after a superior action film.\nLA Confidential\nThis take on '50s cinema goes behind the city's glossy image and\nuncovers a corrupt police force, powerful gangsters and rife prostitution.\nA Life Less Ordinary\nIf you can find Ewan McGregor's new film still showing then go and see\nit. Cameron Diaz co-stars in this brilliant offbeat romance.\nWML\nwith \u00a9w fr l mds mt tt m Gl Jane is released today. It stars Demi Moore as a US Navy officer determined to become the first\nfemale to break into the elite Navy Seals.

Well-known and\ncomforting characters tumble\nthrough its pages: bogeymen, the\nskeletal figure of Death, Jack Frost,\nthe Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny\nand tubby old Father Christmasexcept that the latter two have\nbeen incarnated as the Soul Cake\nDuck and the Hogfather.\nNow there exists a bunch of\ndisagreeable people called the\nAuditors who hate life. They feel\nthat it's disorderly and, quite\nfrankly, just too untidy to put up\nwith. So they hatch a cunning plot:\nto kill the Hogfather. To this end\nthey engage the villainous Teatime\n('\"Teh-a tim-eh',sir... Everyone gets\nit wrong\"), who happens to be a completely certifiable member of\nthe Guild of Assassins. With the\nHogfather temporarily out of the\nway, it seems only natural - by a delightful quirk of logic - that Death\nhimself, with a series of rather lame\nHO.HO.HO.s, should step heroically into the breach... You see, the\nHogfather's elimination is not just a commercial pity: it signals the end\nof the world as we know it, for\nobscure reasons that are eventually\nexplained. Mixed up in this battle\nfor the soul of humanity are the air-headed wizards, the wonderfully\npractical Susan, who is Death's granddaughter by adoption, an oh-god of Hangovers, a wizard-invent-ed Al machine named Hex which\nthrows a tantrum when it's refused\nits FTB (Fluffy Toy Bunny), a group\nof dopey beggars who live on the\nhaute cuisine of mud-and-old-boots and a million more sporadic\nand delightful characters.\nThe book is brilliantly inventive\nand has a wonderful feel-good factor for all those inner children out\nthere. It's also whimsical, idiosyncratic, quixotic, excitable and con-fused: there are repeated jumps\nbetween scenes and much sporadically obscure reasoning. In part icu lar, the long-awaited elucidation of\nthe plot ultimately proves to be\nembarrassingly incoherent. Even\nDeath eventually metamorphoses\ninto a talkative New-Age-Bloke\nwith a conscience and a dreadful\nsense of humour. Well, I ask you...!\nI have to insist that my opinions\non Pratchett remain valid. His novels are insubstantial, frothy pieces\nof wildly invented fantasy with\nsprawling plots so fantastically riddled with holes that they wouldn't sieve rocks. Nevertheless, this\nbook is a bubbly, beguiling concoction that sparkles and wriggles\nincessantly with a sort of frenetic\nenthusiasm. Prejudices aside, the\nauthor's obviously having so much\nfun making fun of the world and of\nhis world that it would be churlish\nto refuse to even smile back... and\nonce you start smiling it's impossible to stop. O Min\nThought for the day\nNo.5: That curry bill\n1 wish to avoid becoming a second\nSimon Baker (and after his face-melting ly dull article on EMU, none\nof us would want that). Hence, I am going to avoid snide y but very\npoignant comments about the far-ci call y rigged election of the new\nICU President, at least for the\nmoment. This week we concern\nourselves with matters arising just\nafter the dramatic results' release\n(it's just a shame that only about\nten per cent of the South\nKensington posse could be bothered contributing to them).\nAnyway, those of you who are\nstill reading after that rather tiresome tirade might like to know that\nthe Felix editor, the Features Editor,\nmyself and a certain Mr. Jon\nWalmsley (an esteemed denizen of\nthe nether regions of Southside\nBar) went for a curry after the election result. (Felix recommend\nKwality Tandoori, down by the tube\nstation for the creamiest Tikka\nMasala in town. Oh, do say hello to\nMr. Khan for me.) The usual conversation flow resulted; moving\nfrom angry screeched speeches\nabout the treachery of the Mary's block vote; onto food (did 1 mention how hungry we were?),\nfavourite beers of the assembled\ndining foursome; the upcoming IC\nRag beer festival (which, by the\ntime you read this, will be a dim\nand distant hungover memory),\nback to food (yes, we were star v ing) and so on. Poppadoms, nan\nbread? Korma or madras? Chutney\nor that weird orange minty stuff?\n(Forgive my ignorance). Anyway,\nyou know the score.\nEventually the meal came to an\nend. Much lager had been con-sum ed; we could almost forget the\nelection; everyone was stuffed. Jon\nWalmsley was falling asleep; Jon\nTrout was breaking wind; Jeremy\nwas trying to convince me not to\nstand for Felix editor. Then the\nproblems began.\nYes, the bill arrived. It is practically inconceivable that just one\npiece of paper could cause such\nwidespread controversy. No formulation since those of Adam\nSmith, Albert Einstein and Charles\nDarwin has enjoyed a greater\nvogue. At this juncture I must point\nsomething out. According to UCAS\nrules, the four of us had a combined A level points score of 118.\n(Eleven As and aB). Yet we were\nstill completely unable to decide\nwho owed how much of the bill.\nThe problems were caused by\ntwo people having insufficient read-ies; a trip to the cash machine\nsolved the immediate problem, but\nnot the prevailing one. Why did four\nyoung men with a reasonable dose\nof common sense find themselves\nhaving the following conversation?\n\"Right, I 've put in twenty-five quid,\nand the bill was sixty quid, so\nsomebody owes me ten quid.\"\n(Nothing is ever that simple.)\n\"Hang on though, because Jeremy\ndidn't have rice, so he should have\ntwo quid off.\"\n\"Fair enough then, you put in\neleven quid, I put in eight quid, us\ntwo both put in twenty-five quid.\nSomebody owes us money.\"\n\"I 'll take some off next month's rent.\"\n\"Yeah, but how much?\"\n\"Wait. You and Jon owe me money\nfor the bet on the election result.\"\n\"Look at it this way... erm... no...\nwait... that's not right...\"\n\"Look, lads, let's start again.\"\nCalling all mathematics professors and postgraduates. Is there\nany way this problem can be\nsolved? Eight-dimensional m atri ces? Line integrals? Vector calc u lus? Perhaps an analytical solution\nis impossible. Could we try a numerical method? We certainly\ncouldn't find one, and 1 don't think\nI 'll ever get my ten quid back.\nDid I mention the election\nyet...?\nAH Campbell\n\n"

    "content": "14 November 1997 NEWS\nNews in Brief...\nPHASERS SET TO RAG MAG STUN BEYOND A JOKE\nAmerican inventor Jan Eric Herr\nhas developed a weapon with\neffects that parallel those of sci-fi\nlaser guns. Mr. Herr's weapon\nworks on a similar principle to\ntasers, hand-held 'defence'\nweapons that deliver a high voltage shock to the victim. It\nemploys 2 lasers to create a'pl as ma channel,' a column of ionised\nair which electricity can flow\nthrough. Then an electrical cur-rent, is sent through the target.\nThis has the effect of painlessly\nstunning the victim - or worse -depending on the setting of the\ngun. Using lasers also increases\nthe range of these weapons from\nfive to around one hundred\nmetres.\nThe one major drawback at the\nmoment is the weapon's large\nsize. As technology progresses\nhowever, the components are certainly going to get smaller. Prof.\nAnthony Bell, from Imperial's plasma physics research group,\nagreed that a portable weapon\ncould not be ruled out in the near\nfuture. He added that he was distressed that plasma physics could\nbe turned to such applications.\nRag's annual humourous fundraising magazine, the rag mag, has\nthis year recieved heavy crit is is m from Union officers due to several\nof the jokes contained being unacceptably racist or homophobic.\nAndy Heeps, ICU President, told\nFelix that it was \"exceptionally\ninappropriate\" and the magazine\ncould not be sold unless three of\nthe jokes were deleted. The matter\nwill be discussed at the union\nexecutive committee on Tuesday,\nand no copies are allowed to be\nsold off campus until then, as it is\npossible that legal action could be\ntaken against Rag. This has also\nprevented Rag from selling them in\ntheir London collection planned for\nTuesday morning.\nConcerns have also been\nvoiced that the mag will fail to raise\nany money, as the cover price is\nonly ten pence above the production costs, and no advertising was\nsought.\nDue to Rag'sinn activity over\nthe summer, The Royal College of\nScience Union have also released a rag mag which has so far escaped\nthe censor's pen. Both mags will\nbe avail i able at all rag events.\nJT*7\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE SPORTS CENTRE\"7 I= \u00bbR: IIMCES GARDEN SEX T48964I iSl ' .\n' '\n.\n. .\n.\n.

'........\nThe London Church of Christ:\nrighteous religion or creepy congregation?\nThe London Church of Christ (LCC)\nis one of a number of groups in this\ncountry that form part of an organisation currently known as the\nInternational Churches of Christ,\nalso referred to as the Boston\nMovement. This year the LCC have\nbeen trying with a new fer v our to\npersuade IC students to join them.\nThe LCC considers itself a Christian church, taking the New\nTestament as its basis; however,\nsome evangelical bodies have\nrepudiated some of their doctrines.\nEvery new member of the LCC is\nplaced under the wing of a disciple\nwho exercises a close degree of\nsupervision both spiritually and\nsocially. Although the disciples are\nenthusiastic and sincere, their\nyouth and inexperience renders\nsome of them unqualified to help\nthose seeking guidance.\nMembership of the LCC\ninvolves a level of time commitment far in excess of that expected\nby most mainstream Churches, and\na considerable amount of effort in\nrecruiting new members. The leaders make it clear that no friend ,\nparent, or job can be more important than work for the LCC. The\nLCC's membership (now just over\n500) is predominantly young; well\nover half are in their 20s or late\nteens, and a significant proportion\nof the members are students.\nThe LCC's refusal to accept\ncriticism from other Christian\ngroups and society in general has\ncreated a hostile relationship. The\nLCC considers its interpretation of\nscripture as exclusively correct,\nmaking discussions between them\nand evangelical bodies impossible.\nThe authoritarian structure of the\nLCC and the pressure they exert on\ntheir members has led to many\ncomplaints, especially as the latter\nof these tends to cause students to\ndo badly in examinations. Leaders\ndeny that anything other than\n\"strong advice\" is given and do not\nbelieve that the pressure on members is excessive. They also maintain that it is their right to be\nconcerned for the whole life of\ntheir members.\nLCC meetings have been\nbanned from college premises,\nthough it has been reported that\nthey are still going ahead in\nunknown locations around cam-pus. The college chaplaincy has\nexpressed some concern about the\nLCC doctrines, the tight stronghold\nthey have on student members,\nand the way they mono polis e members' time.\nConcerned students can contact the IC Chaplaincy on extension\n49600\n\n"

    "content": "8 COLUMNS 14 November 1997\nDoing this journalistic\nlark, one gets used to\nbrickbats and bouquets,\nparticularly the former. So it was\nnice to read Robert Emerson's letter in last week's Felix. The man\nclearly possesses exceptional\njudgement and insight, but I must\nreassure him and others that 1 am\nnot getting tame. True, it has been\na while since my image has been\ndecorated with pins in Sherfield\n(that has happened before), but\nnot everyone is so en amour ed with yours truly, however. News\nreaches me of comments by one\nof the dBs DJs on Friday. Strangely,\nI am one of the few people never\nto have had a dig at the music in\nthe Union. Moreover, I was gyrating alongside the young people in\nthat very room two days before\nthis event. Was ever a man more\nmisunderstood? Still, it's nice to be\nnoticed. That doesn't mean it is\nopen season on Baker...\nInvestment advice is rarely\ngiven in Felix, partly because none\nof you have more than the cost of\n20 Marlboro in the bank, so 'win-ning at roulette on the Titanic1\ndeserves a comment. Call me a hard-bitten old capitalist, but I have never had much time for ethical investment. If a company is\ndoing something particularly dicey,\neven if legal, the truth will usually\nout, public opinion will turn against\nthem, if they have a retail element,\nand the share\nprice will fall\naccordingly. In\ngeneral, companies that do\nthings that will\nlead them to end\nup with egg on\ntheir face often\nhave broader\nmanagement inadequacies that\ngo beyond ethical\nissues. Of course,\nif you as an individual do not like what an organisation is doing, you can vote with\nyour feet and sell your shares or\navoid their products. Pension\nfunds are a different matter. Fund\nmanagers should be out to secure\nthe highest rate of return within\ntheir given risk criteria. Anything\nelse is unacceptable, and they\nit CDu\" '\u2022imp\nDQ\nCOE I/O should invest accordingly. In pursuing this aim, many companies\nwill be filtered out on the basis of\nfinancial fundamentals that may be\ncoincident with ethics; for exam-ple, Tesco recently dropped kangaroo meat, sensing a potential\nbacklash from its customers that\nwould impact on\nit share price,\nbefore fund\nmanagers began\nselling their\nstock. If I was a member of the\nUSS pension\nscheme, I would\nbe less than\nhappy if my fellow members\nvoted for under j \u2014j. performance, as\nwill happen if\nthe managers' hands are tied. The\nGovernment will only guarantee a minimum pension, if things go\nhorribly wrong, so the notion that\nit will have 'no impact' on pensions\nis plainly wrong. Deciding ethical\ninvestment guidelines is a bit like\nplaying God - our friends in the\nSocialist Worker Party would argue\nthat all capitalism was immoral\nand exploitative, so where does\nthat leave you? Still, on one point,\nI am full square behind Tom Hay.\nAvoid anything bearing Linda\nMcCarthey's signature.\nReading IC Distorter recently,\nas I often do, I read something\ninteresting. While that's news in\nitself, the matter in question concerned the planned refectory for\nthe BMS. Someone implied that\nthis would be a branch of Pret a Manger. Imagine my delight.\nNaturally suspicious, 1 phoned my\nfriend Ian Caldwell, fresh from his\nholiday in South Africa, to check it\nout. Sadly, someone's been\nembroidering the facts, behaviour\nwe deplore at Felix. It seems the\ndesign will look like a Pret a Manger branch, but no operator\nhas yet been found. This is a golden opportunity to raise the standards of catering here.
