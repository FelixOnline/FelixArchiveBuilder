    "content": "food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFood\nFood Editor \u2013 Hannah Theodorou\n23\nFriday 12 October 2007 felix\nThe debate: nature versus nourriture\nI\ndecided to get over-analytical\nwhen I read recently that Heston Blumenthal, proprietor of\nthe world\u2019s \u2018best\u2019 restaurant (poll\nof 600 journos and critics), The\nFat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, had overdosed his head chef with chilli oil in an\nattempt to locate the neural correlate of\nthe pleasure derived from \u2018hot\u2019 (NOT\nthe same thing as \u2018spicy\u2019) food. That is,\nwhich part of the brain was affected,\nand might subsequently be targeted.\nBecause it seems to me this approach\ncontrasts somewhat with the philosophy another Michelin three-star win-ner, Marco Pierre White, spoke of on\nHell\u2019s Kitchen. As we watched Marco\ncasting for and netting a beautiful fish,\nwe heard him saying a chef should \u201clet\nmother nature do the talking\u201d, and that\ntheir role is to simply reveal Her beauty,\nrather than attempt to improve on Her.\nIn the name of the 80:20 rule (without\ngetting too bogged down in how well\nI portray these immense achievers and\ntheir central philosophies), I will now\ngive my tuppence-ha\u2019penny\u2019s worth on\nthe matter; because there is a differ-ence, and I believe it\u2019s a rather important one.\nThe difference, I suspect, is the same\nas the difference between attempting\nto engineer our planetary environment\nusing man\u2019s machines, and simply living harmoniously with the rest of life,\nwhich maintain the conditions on\nearth fit for human life as an emergent\nproperty of the earth system. Because\nthe biosphere is surely the best life-support system we will ever have.\nIt is the same difference, let me go on,\nas between excessive genetic engineering of our offspring, and relying on our\nsense of beauty and love to guide us\nthrough our lives. Because we will never fully be able to calculate for certain\nwhom we should procreate with, and\nat what time. It\u2019s heroic to live a full life\nin the face of non-total knowledge.\nThirdly and finally, I say it is the same\ndifference as between again relying on\nexternal \u2018chemical\u2019 stimulants to feel\nwe are fully alive, and doing truly human things to make us happy \u2013 the\nhumanness judged with reference to\nbeliefs about the way our minds work,\nspringing from knowledge of evolutionary theory. After all, we are humans aren\u2019t we?\nFelix examines whether food as a science is a valid concept or whether you just need the finest ingredients\nAs any good scientist knows, nature\ncan simply be defined away as \u201cwhat\nhappens anyway\u201d; and of course there\nis no clear dichotomy between the\nchemical and the organic (what about\norganic chemistry!). So yes, use science to improve cooking techniques\nand understand the pleasure derived in\nterms of brain processes and the biology of visual aesthetics. However, here\nis my point: We are fools if we think we\nshould part from our own human na-ture, or can improve on Mother Nature.\nAs my hero E. O. Wilson ends his book,\nConsilience: The Unity of Knowledge\n(the best book I have ever read; utterly\nlife changing; far better than Dawkins;\nNoel Forrest read it), \u201cWhat does it all mean? This is\nwhat it all means. To the extent that we\ndepend on prosthetic devices to keep\nourselves and the biosphere alive, we\nwill render everything fragile. To the\nextent that we banish the rest of life, we\nwill impoverish our own species for all\ntime. And if we should surrender our\ngenetic nature to machine-aided rati-ocination, and our ethics and art and\nour very meaning to a habit of careless\ndiscursion in the name of progress,\nimagining ourselves god-like and absolved from our ancient heritage, we\nwill become nothing.\u201d\nSo I\u2019m in MPW\u2019s camp, but happy to\nbe proved wrong, Heston, if there\u2019s any\ndanger I could get a table?\nI was tempted to call this the\n\u2018perfect\u2019 cup of tea, but that\nwould be to over-hype a process so simple that it pains me\nthat you don\u2019t do it.\nIt actually hurts me to see a\nteabag fondled with a spoon in\na \u2018flash-stewing\u2019 attempt. Expect to be judged when I come\nover for a cuppa.\nYou have been warned!\nThis popular Italian dish should\nideally be cooked over charcoal in the summer but, failing\nthat, a grill will do fine. Extra\nVirgin olive oil (from the first\ncold pressing) has a more peppery flavour and works better than plain olive in lightly\ncooked Italian dishes such as\nthis but the latter will also do\nfine here. Great as a snack any\ntime of day.\nYou\u2019ll need the following:\n3 very ripe tomatoes\n1 small clove of garlic, finely\nchopped\n1 tbsp of olive oil, plus some\nto drizzle\nBasil (optional), chopped\nsalt and pepper to season\n2 slices bread\n1) Chop the tomatoes roughly\nand cook in a pan with the tablespoon of olive oil for 3-4\nminutes, stirring round until\nthey are heated through. Season will salt and pepper to\ntaste.\n2) In the meantime, drizzle a\nsmall amount of olive oil over\nthe bread and toast until brown\nunder the grill on both sides (the\noil will make a bit of a mess of a\ntoaster).\n3) Chuck the chopped basil in with\nthe tomatoes and heat through.\nRecipes: Bruschetta and tea \u2013 you\u2019ll eat what we tell you to and you\u2019ll like it\nServe on the toasted bread.\nThis recipe serves 1 and takes\napproximately 5 minutes to pre-pare, 5 minutes to cook and only\ncosts 40p per portion. So you\nhave no excuse. Try it now!\nCheat\u2019s bruschetta\nAn acceptable cup of tea\nMarco Pierre White: The devil in the kitchen\n1) Put teabag in preferably warm\nmug.\n2) Fill to brim with just-boiled\nwater.\n3) Leave for three minutes.\n4) Remove bag with minimal\nsqueezing, creating room for the\nmilk.\n5) Add milk and sugar to taste, or\na slice of lemon.

Reports\nwritten by the Sabbatical Officers and\nFaculty Union staff were being passed\nas tabled, without objection from\nthe Council members. The reports\n\u2013 which can be found on the Union\u2019s\nwebsite \u2013 are mainly for accountability\npurposes, so that the student body has\nthe opportunity to see that the Sabbatical Officers and Faculty Union staff are\ndoing their jobs satisfactorily.\nThe proceedings were running\nsmoothly and rather hastily until it\nwas the turn of the GSA (Graduate\nStudents Association) Chair Jon Matthews to put forward his report. Union President Stephen Brown questioned Mr Matthews, telling him that\nhe thought the report \u201cwas not doing\nhimself justice\u201d. After some futile explanation from Mr Matthews, Council\nmoved to a vote which ultimately led to\nthe report being rejected.\nNow, are you ready for this? It\u2019s com-plicated. Deep breath...\nThe specific reason the paper was rejected remains unclear. It appears that\nCouncil is unhappy with the amount of\nwork Mr Matthews has done over the\nsummer period in return for the \u00a32000\nhonorarium that the GSA Chair is customarily awarded.\nSo far the GSA Chair has been in office for only five weeks. Due to the awful GSA elections that took place over\nthe summer, the Chair was elected\nlater than originally intended. Seemingly, Union Officials believe the honorarium was intended as payment for an\neight week period and as a result, Mr\nMatthews has been given too much\nmoney.\nHowever, the original intention of\nthe honorarium has been questioned\nand remains the focus of ongoing investigations in the Union.\nAdvocates of the GSA are saying that\nthe honorarium is intended as a payment for the year, rather than just the\nFelix was brought to you by:\nfelix 1,382\nFriday 12/10/07\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London\nSW7 2BB.

The 928 mile trek took Mr Collins thirteen days to\ncomplete, excluding the days in between attempts. Mr Collins\u2019\nwas due to complete the journey back in June but he fell from his\nbicycle breaking his wrist in the process. The proceeds from the\ntrip will be put towards the redevelopment of Beit. Donations can\nstill be made at www.justgiving.com/pedalingforimperial\nsummer and that its purpose is to be\nattractive enough to tempt potential\nGSA Chairs away from paid teaching\nwork within College.\nUnion Officials argue that the payment is similar to that of the Faculty\nUnion Presidents, intended as a summer payment and no more.\nAdded to all of this excitement, the\ncircumstances under which Mr Matthews received the honorarium payment are shadowy.\nIf you\u2019re still with me, good on you,\nwe\u2019re almost there... Just one long and\nwinding paper trail to follow now.\nOriginally, the GSA asked the Union\nExecutive (Exec) committee to fund\nthe summer honorarium at a meeting\nduring the summer. Exec refused and\ntold the GSA that it needed to sort the\nmatter out itself.\nSubsequently, \u00a32000 was taken out\nof the GSA budget to pay the honorar-ium. What remains unclear is how this\npayment was authorised. Minutes are\nnot taken at GSA committee meetings\nmeaning that no written record exists\nof who authorised payment.\nThe Union has asked the GSA for an\naudit trail to trace the circumstances\nunder which the honorarium payment\nwas made but so far this has not been\nprovided. The Union and the GSA are\nworking together on the quest to find\nout what the hell has happened over\nthe past few months.\nWell done for reaching the end of the\narticle.\nUnion reports for all committee\nmeetings can be found online at:\nunion.ic.ac.uk/meetings\nRiveting\n\n"

    "content": "music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\nFriday 12 October 2007 felix\nMusic\nFoals live and Sum 41\u2019s new album reviewed\nThis week Felix was sent on a mission\nto see Foals, an up-and-coming band\nsome of you may know and the rest of\nyou will undoubtedly know soon. They\nhave been called the \u2018best new live\nband in the UK\u2019, so Felix was understandably excited before the gig about\nseeing them.\nThey play dance-influenced music\nwhich is percussion-led and features\nhigh-pitched, technically complex guitars parts which provide the melodies\nalong with occasional synths and keys.\nThe support band were \u2018Metronomy\u2019,\nan electro outfit who were great fun to\nwatch. They all wore touch activated\nlights on their chests which were used\nin synch with their fun dance act to\nprovide an interesting viewing spectacle to go with the foot-tapping beats\nand synths they played. Unfortunately\nthe crowd was not yet in the mood for\ndancing, but I would definitely keep\nan eye out for a headline tour from\nthem in the future which would be well\nworth checking out. Before coming on\nto play, Foals appeared on-stage and\ndid their own soundcheck, which is\nunusual for a band of their size, leading\nsome in the audience to become disappointed thinking they had already\nstarted, but it wasn\u2019t long until they\narrived onstage \u2018properly\u2019 to rapturous\napplause before launching into their\ntraditional intro song.\nThis started as a purely instrumental\nsong which layered up sounds in a cacophony of noise until it was stripped\ndown to a frenetic beat and tune which\nset the pace for the rest of the show.\nCrowd favourites \u2018Balloons\u2019 and \u2018The\nFrench Open\u2019 were dispersed with early on, and a lot of new songs from their\nnewly-recorded debut album were also\nincluded. A personal highlight for me\nwas \u2018Two Steps Twice\u2019 \u2013 an old song of\ntheirs during which the whole crowd\nseemingly danced as one during the\nclimax which was a perfect blend of\na sing-along chorus and irrepressible\nbeats. The band were always moving\naround while playing \u2013 seemingly battling with their guitars for prime stage\nspace, wielding them highly strung\nlike weapons being jerked around the\nstage.\nThe mostly young crowd \u2013 possibly\ninfluenced by the band\u2019s recent appearance on Channel 4\u2019s \u2018Skins\u2019 - are rabid\nfor more of the \u2018classics\u2019, and are duly\nrewarded for their enthusiastic reception to the new songs with fan-favour-ite \u2018Mathletics\u2019, whose furious tempo\nleaves everyone exhausted. The band\nthen finish off a relatively short set with\nthe incendiary \u2018Hummer\u2019 which leaves\neveryone wanting more. The guitarist,\nJimmy, then re-appears back on stage\napologetically saying \u201cI guess you guys\nare expecting an encore, but we\u2019re a\nnew band and we don\u2019t have any more\nsongs!\u201d. The crowd is disappointed, but\nthen the rest of the band re-emerge\nand tell us \u201cthis is a new one and we\u2019ve\nnever played it live before \u2013 so it might\nbe sh*t\u201d. It isn\u2019t, and provides a fittingly\neuphoric end to an exhausting evening\nof non-stop dancing and singing which\nI look to forward to repeating again the\nnext time they tour!\nToby Prudden\nYou could be mistaken for thinking\nthat \u2018Underclass Hero\u2019 is Deryck Wibley\u2019s first solo venture; Whibley alone\ngraces the cover (with spit delightfully\nhanging down from his mouth), Whibley alone is accredited almost the entire music and lyrical content and the\nfirst in line in the thank-yous is his wife\nand punk-pop starlet Avril Lavigne.\nHowever, \u2018Underclass Hero\u2019 is Sum\n41\u2019s fourth album. The opening track\non the album is the title track \u2018Underclass Hero.\u2019 It sounds scarily similar to\nphenomenally popular \u2018Fat Lip\u2019 from\n2001\u2019s \u2018All Killer No Filler\u2019 that is arguably the prime reason for the mainstream success that they have received.\nPerhaps they tried to use the same winning formula, but unfortunately ended\nup with pretty much the same song.\nNext up is \u2018Walking Disaster,\u2019 which\njust seems to re-emphasise that Sum 41\nhaven\u2019t really moved on. It\u2019s all a bit too\nemotional \u2013 hating your dad, your parents not caring, etc. Not only that, but it\nis has striking similarities to a speeded-up version of Blink-182\u2019s \u2018Adam\u2019s Song.\u2019\n\u2018Count Your Last Blessings\u2019 however\nis where Sum 41 launch the energy-charged and catchy material that they\nare known for. Combining the fast lyrics and drumbeat with gently and slow\nrepetitive piano they seem to have\ncome upon a winning combination.\nUnfortunately, despite this track, the album takes a turn for the worse with \u2018Ma\nPoubelle\u2019 perhaps because it\u2019s one of\nonly two songs co-written with slightly\nodd-ball drummer Stevo; Whibley was\npresumably obliged to accept some\nsort of contribution from other band-members.\nI knew that I would like this album\nbefore I had even heard it. Perhaps it\nwas my under-developed teenage music\ntaste that has still now left me susceptible to the cheesy punk-pop charm of\nSum 41.\nThis is definitely an album for those\nthat loved Sum 41 the first time round\nand the kiddies that were never there\nthe first time round. Sum 41 is touring\nEngland this October and will no doubt\nplay a winning combination of new and\nold material alike.\nJenny Gibson\nNME Student Quiz\nIn a search of Britain\u2019s Brainiest\nUniversity, the UK\u2019s favourite\nweekly music magazine will be\ntesting students across both\nmusic and general knowledge to\nreveal where the most intelligent\nyoung minds are studying this\nyear.

With seats for over 500, there is plenty of leg-room to\nensure a comfortable performance. Whether you are into opera, stand up comedy or dance\nthere will always be something to interest you. The theatre puts on shows produced by twenty\ndifferent companies per month, which is probably more than the average theatre in London!\nThe Bloomsbury has been the setting for notable comedians such as Lily Savage, Eddie\nIzzard, Ricky Gervais and Jimmy Carr in filming their DVDs. With a bar on both levels, the\naudience need not exert themselves too much. One can even order interval drinks in advance\nat a reduced price: wow! Canap\u00e9s and light snacks are also offered. Those of you with a love\nof dance might want to see \u2018Transtango\u2019, which brings the philosophy of the tango to a cosmopolitan London setting and combines video projection with the distinctive music associated\nwith the dance.\nFelix is trying to wrangle some press tickets to see this performance so watch out in future\nissues for its review. If not, beat us to it and see it for yourself. I\u2019m sure many will remember the \u2018Horrible Histories\u2019 book series from their childhood (for those who don\u2019t, the series\nbrings history in a comical and engaging way, through the medium of literature, to young\n\u2018uns). Unfortunately, the \u2018Awful Egyptians\u2019 and \u2018Ruthless Romans\u2019 are drawing to a close but it\ngives one an idea of the original type of theatre offered at the Bloomsbury.\n\u2018Othello\u2019 seems to be the toast of the theatrical town at the moment, as the Birmingham\nStage Company performs a gripping rendition of the classic. From 13-19th October, tickets\nare ten pounds for students, a possibility for this weekend perhaps.\nwww.thebloomsbury.com\nShakespeare\u2019s Globe, Southwark\n\u201cSuth-ark\u201d is where the Globe is situated, further east along the riverbank from the National\nTheatre. An absolute must to attend the theatre once frequented by the fans of theatre and literature\u2019s messiah (open to discussion) back in the Tudor times. A beautiful building recreated\nto what it would have been over 400 years ago, it is partially exposed from the elements with\na thatched roof covering a percentage of the audience. The stage and seating are attractively\nmade of wood.\nThose viewing Shakespeare\u2019s plays (yes, one can only see Shakespeare here) standing will\nhave to pray for no rain or fork out for a seat under the roof. Having experienced \u2018Macbeth\u2019\nstanding, one\u2019s enjoyment is increased by being closer to the actors and getting a very unique\ntheatrical experience. Seats are also available in front of and indeed behind the stage- \u201cThe\nGods\u201d is where Queen Elizabeth would have sat to be seen. The Globe\u2019s shop (and bar) promises to further your enjoyment and understanding of the plays. Unfortunately the theatre\u2019s\nseason ended but a few days ago on October 7th, so those keen to go will have to wait until\nthe slightly warmer months. However tours are offered of the theatre, so log on to find out\nmore.\nwww.shakespeares-globe.org\nNext Week \u2013 Bookshops\nThe National Theatre, Embankment\nDon\u2019t be put off by the not-so-architecturally-pleasing concrete mass sitting on London\u2019s Southbank! Not your traditional\ndesign for a theatre and not even located in the West End! The National is a personal favourite and all misgivings you have on\nits exterior are extinguished upon entering this establishment. A short walk across the bridge and then along the river from\nEmbankment station, the theatre is set amongst other distractions such as a permanent second hand book sale, free talks,\nthe National Film theatre and a skate park, for those so inclined.\nThe National itself is home to three auditoriums (Olivier, Lyttleton and Cottslowe) and puts on the classics, new plays and\nalso musicals. Airy, with spaciously high ceilings and modern, it offers a whole host of cafes, bars and restaurants selling\nsumptuous treats to keep you going through your show. While you wait, be entertained by a live band or stroll through the\nartwork on display throughout the theatre\u2019s foyers.\nNever having been let down by the National in any way, I thoroughly recommend a visit in-lieu of any work you were planning to do. Past productions include \u2018History Boys\u2019 (featuring the original cast who went on to appear in the film) and \u2018The\nEmperor Jones\u2019 (reviewed in a previous Felix). It\u2019s forthcoming play \u2018War Horse\u2019 explores the roles of animals in war and\nbegins later this month.\nwww.nationaltheatre.org.uk\nWritten by Caz Knight, designed by Rosie Grayburn\n\n"

Artfully conceptualized by playwright Sam Thomas, it\nis directed by Georgina Guy and produced by Ben Monks; both founders of\ntheir own production company Grey\nLight Productions. Performed at the\nBlue Elephant Theatre in Camberwell,\nthe location and layout of the little Arts\nHouse was a memorable part of the entire experience.\nPhilip Brook is a very convincing Barry. He wears a stern grey moustache, a\nbleak-looking vest and mousy shoes, a\nclose resemblance to that uptight, patriarchal male relative we all have in\nthe family. Although without any hint\nof employment, Barry has great plans\nto set up his own state and garner respect and authority from his members\n(population of three). Brook gives the\ncharacter of Barry a harsh, hard and\nstubborn quality, evoking emotions\nranging from annoyance to pity as the\naudience gets to know him.\nUncle Barry finds companionship in\nhis loyal buddy Mickey, played by the\nlovable Matthew Ward. Mickey has\nbeen, for lack of a better word, shoved\ninto Barry\u2019s elaborate plan without\nmuch say himself. That broad stature,\nbooming voice and steely stare foil the\nmeek and sentimental nature of Mickey. Ward wins the audience over with\nhis tolerance for Barry\u2019s idiosyncrasies\nwhen his partner turns into a dictator.\nHe surprises us by shedding a tear or\ntwo during the course of the play, in\nthe most humorous way nonetheless.\nThe cast is also \u201cfleshed out\u201d by\nPecks, Barry\u2019s adult nephew. Played by\nLee Bane, he is like the rest of the cast-not as straightforward as our first im-pression. A wannabe \u2018Becks\u2019, he would\nprobably work better as a Liverpudlian\nversion of American rapper Eminem.\nPecks is Mummy\u2019s prized (FHM-reading) son with a knack for solving\nconflicts between Mickey and Barry.\nIntelligence and diplomacy of this sort\nhints at the complexity of his character,\nrespectfully acted out by Bane.\nThe closeness of the stage meant audience members were sitting in Uncle\nBarry\u2019s living room, as he launches\nhis state-building strategies. Props\nand lighting changes were modest but\nskillfully managed. The range of music\nplayed (and sung) contributed significantly to the overall entertainment factor and managed to conjure numerous\nlaughs from the audience.\nWhat touched me were the attitudes\nof the production team. The size and\nyouth of the company gave me the opportunity to meet each one of them\nduring pre- and post-performance\ndrinks. The group was spirited and\nyoung, with boundless energy and enthusiasm for the process of production\nand the hard work involved.\nActors were very hands-on in preparing for their production, as Mickey\nand Pecks were spotted milling around\nthe theatre during the earlier hours\nbefore the curtains rose. The crowd\nwas made up of Grey Light Production\nenthusiasts and a few eccentrics with\nprobable distant connections to independent theatre in London \u2013 people\nwho probably found this night out in\nCamberwell just another day out in the\npark.\nUncle Barry graces the Blue\nElephant theatre stage until the\n20th October. Uncle Barry (Philip Brook) and his \u2018kidult\u2019 nephew Pecks (Lee Bane)\nBlack holes and milking cows\nQuantum physics and art? Go forth to the Science Museum and be enlightened, says Rosie Grayburn\nI\nt\u2019s our dream come true here at\nthe Felix Arts desk! Science and\nart have finally been united by\nour favourite institution. The\nScience Museum (just round the\ncorner\u2026) has an on-going arts project\nscheme in which contemporary artists\nwith perspectives on the past, present\nand future of science and technology\nexhibit their work in various mediums-film, sculpture, photography...\nOne of the largest projects is featured\nin the popular \u2018Who Am I\u2019 gallery (cur-rently closed in order to fix all those\nover-used buttons on the \u2018hands-on\u2019\nexhibits, including \u2018The Great Sperm\nRace\u2019), which includes the work of\nseven artists, exploring the themes of\ngenetics, sexuality and identity. All exhibits are made by hand \u2013 pen, paint or\ncast iron \u2013 highlighting the individuality and skill of human beings; the key\ntheme of this permanent exhibition.\nContinuing along this drift, the\nnewest addition to the museum\u2019s art\nportfolio is filmmaker Grace Weir\u2019s\nexhibition \u2018In my own time\u2019. Created\nduring an artist\u2019s residency at St. John\u2019s\nCollege, Oxford, she shares what she\nhas learnt from her unique surroundings with her audience. With the main\nthemes of the exhibition of timekeep-ing, theoretical physics and Einstein,\nfour very different films are presented\nin a suitably \u2018black-hole\u2019-like gallery.\nAs you walk in, the first screen on\nyour right shows \u2018Picture of the floating world\u2019. With obvious Japanese\nundertones, Weir explores the idea of\nthe passing moment. The photography\nis beautiful, following a woman passing time standing by a tree under the\nblossom: a classic Japanese symbol. It\nsounds trivial but you really start to become aware of the landscape and time\npassing before your eyes in the most\npoetic way possible.\nThe film \u2018A little bit of unknown\u2019 is\nan interview with physicist Paul Tod\nfocusing on one the most fascinating\nphenomena in modern physics- the\nblack hole. It cuts from his office to an\nobservatory, teasing you with glimpses\nof far away constellations. What starts\noff as simple sharing of knowledge\nfrom scientist to artist turns into deep\nreflection on the sublime, unobtainable\nbeauty of space through a telescope.\nAlong a similar line is the animation\n\u2018A deep field for the time deaf\u2019. This\nis Grace Weir\u2019s first fully animated\nfilm and was inspired by photographs\ntaken by the Hubble Space Telescope.\nShe was fascinated to find out how\nlong it takes for the light to reach our\neyes from these far away bodies, so far\naway that the stars may have ceased to\nbe by the time we see them. Putting\nyou in mind of that popular nursery\nrhyme- you gawp as stars, like jewels,\ntwinkle away for 20 minutes. It is quite\na treat, especially seeing as the London sky doesn\u2019t ordinarily like to share\nthese gems with us at night. The view\nyou see is one not seen by the naked\neye, but Weir wants us to look into the\nnight sky and remember that we are\nlooking into the past.\nThe title exhibit \u2018In my own time\u2019 is\na slightly more practical film, as you\nwatch the artist constructing various devices for timekeeping in her\nown home as she gives a commentary,\nspewing out facts regarding time and\nspace; the main theme being that our\nmodern methods for timekeeping are\ndiverging from the natural movements\nof the earth.\nAs we watch a cow being milked, she\ntells us that before time was measured\nso strictly and followed (by most) so\nrigidly, time and space was measured\nin \u201cthe length of time it takes to milk a\ncow\u201d or \u201cthe distance a medium-sized\nman throws a small stone\u201d. As all this is\nrelayed, you are very much captivated\nand relaxed by the motion of squeezing\nthat cow\u2019s pink udders.\nThis exhibition is worth taking some\ntime out to sit and reflect. I liked what\nit stood for. It said, Time is precious:\ntake more time to appreciate what\u2019s\naround you\u2026 Take as long as you like.\nOr as long as it takes to milk a cow re-ally, really slowly.\nGrace Weir\u2019s exhibition runs until\nthe 25th November. Go, chillax.\nA still taken from A Deep Field for the Time Deaf. Twinkle, twinkle little\ngalaxy... mmm Galaxy\n\u201cBarry has great\nplans to set up\nhis own state and\ngarner respect\nand authority\nfrom his members\n(population of\nthree)\u201d\n\u201cYou really start\nto be aware of\nthe landscape\nand time passing\nbefore your\neyes in the\nmost poetic way\npossible\u201d\n\n"

Has the\nfresh lick of paint already started peeling off the wall?\nFinding the perfect student accommodation in London is nigh on im-possible. Typically students spend five\nminutes flitting in and out of property\nafter property until finally settling on\nthe best of a bad bunch. How do you\nknow if you can trust the integrity of\nyour landlord? Is this really a nice,\nquiet, residential area with a low crime\nrate? If only you could find someone\nwho has lived here before and could\ngive you an honest opinion.\nStudentSay is a new initiative created\nby a student at Imperial who became\n\u2018disenchanted\u2019 with the Private Housing Market and decided to do something about it. After years in the student housing system he and his friends\nput together a website where you, the\ntenant, can give an honest opinion on\nyour accommodation experience with\na particular landlord, in a particular\narea or even at your university.\nBased in Sheffield, the website aims\nto include all cities and universities\nwhere students\u2019 are living in rented\naccommodation. It provides an ever-expanding resource for students to\nsearch for accommodation that comes\nhighly recommended by their peers\nthroughout the UK.\nAn added benefit is that you can do\nthis far more easily from home \u2013 knowing that you can trust the views of real\nlife students rather than the sometimes\noverly generous jargon available from\nan estate agent!\nWith categories such as \u2018distance to\nyour local pub\u2019 and \u2018mobile phone reception\u2019 it takes into account all the\nthings a student house really needs.\nWith quick and easy tick boxes and a\nstar rating system it lets you choose\nfrom a multitude of different criteria\nfor reviewing your student accommodation experience and means that you\ncan do it in a matter of seconds. The\nhandy tips are great too for reminding\nyou about aspects of the decorating\nyou may have forgotten about or telling you how to recognise damp.\nOn top of this you can also read up\non articles giving advice on all aspects\nof university life.

The\nsound of you dancing to your\nfavourite tune, having a drink\nor joining a society are gone\nand now you are faced with\nlectures and getting down to some\nhard work at the institution that is Imperial College.\nMany of you have probably had one\nof the most exhilarating weeks of your\nlife. You will have made loads of new\nfriends and have settled in quite comfortably to student life. For some, how-ever, this may not be the case.\nIt is natural in many aspects to feel\nhomesick at certain times of our lives\nand leaving home for the first time and\nliving with people you don\u2019t know in\na big strange city like London can be\na difficult and daunting experience to\ncome to terms with.\nNot being around things that are familiar to you can often bring on feelings of loneliness, anxiety and sadness;\nthis may put doubts in your mind as to\nwhether you have made the right choice\nin becoming a student at Imperial.\nAll is not lost however. These feelings may only last a week or so until\nyou have settled and there are methods\nand tips you can use to help make you\nfeel better, below is The Information\nand Advice Centre\u2019s top tips for trying\nto avoid or get over homesickness:\n\u2022 Try to get out there and see what\nthe College and Union have to offer.\nNigel Cooke\nStudent Adviser\nInformation\nand Advice\nCentre\nJoining a club or society is a great way\nof meeting new people and can help\nstop you thinking about home.\n\u2022 Acknowledge your feelings but\ntry to convince yourself that it is just\na phase. Feelings of homesickness almost always pass if given time.\n\u2022 Talking to people about your feelings can sometimes help. So make sure\nyou talk to a trusted friend regarding\nyour feelings. This can often make\nthings seem better. If you feel you can\u2019t\ntalk to anyone make use of the College\u2019s counselling service. You can also\ntalk your concerns through with the\nStudent Adviser at the Information\nand Advice Centre on campus.\n\u2022 Try to establish a routine as soon\nas possible. Often keeping busy helps\nto take your mind off thinking about\nhome.\n\u2022 Keep in touch with your friends\nand family. In some cases they can offer you support and reassurance. However, make sure that this is the right\nchoice for you as sometimes talking to\nyour friends and family back home can\nworsen your homesickness.\n\u2022 Give yourself some time. Don\u2019t rush\nto make any rash decisions like quitting your course and leaving. It could\njust be a short phase that a lot of people go through during their first time\nliving away from home.\n\u2022 Remember that many people suffer from homesickness at sometime in\ntheir lives. There will be other students\non your course and in the College who\nare also experiencing the same thing.\nFeeling this way does not make you in-adequate. Plenty of people are experiencing the exact same thing.\nIf you do have feelings of homesickness and you feel it is more than just\na phase and you want to seek some\nimpartial advice on how you can go\nabout coping with these issues, please\nfeel free to contact The Information\nand Advice Centre for advice. Our advice is totally impartial and we can talk\nthrough your worries with you.\nIf you feel you need more emotional\nsupport rather than practical advice it\nmay be worth contacting The Imperial\nCollege Counselling service on: 020\n7594 9637.\nJust remember there are people available who are willing to help, you don\u2019t\nhave to go through it are not alone!\nalso pass on your own gems of knowledge by writing for tthem and sharing\nyour experiences of life as a student. As\nStudentSay is brand new you can really\nhave an impact on its development and\nhave your voice heard. There is no time\nlike the present and the success of this\ngreat enterprise really comes down to\nyou and how many other students in\nthe local area fill it in!\nStudentSaywillbelaunchedthisterm\non the Imperial College Union website\nto make it easy to find and to add to\nthe services available through Imperial\nCollege Union. Watch out for links appearing soon and be sure to check out\nor review your accommodation when\nmaking a move.\nIs it Freshers\u2019 Flu? Is it a hangover? No, as a matter of fact it\u2019s meningitis\nMeningitis is inflammation of the lining surrounding the brain. Put simply,\nthere are two main strains:\nViral meningitis is more common\nand is rarely life-threatening. Contact\nwith someone who has viral meningitis does not increase your chances of\ndeveloping the disease.\nBacterial meningitis is very serious and needs urgent treatment. The\nmost common cause amongst students\nin the UK is meningococcus, of which\ngroup C (\u201cMenC\u201d) causes the most\noutbreaks. However the other groups\nof meningococcus, and indeed other\nbacteria, can cause meningitis. So\neven having the vaccination (which is\nagainst MenC) does not entirely protect you.\nSepticaemia is blood poisoning\ncaused by bacteria multiplying in the\nblood. When this is meningococcal\nsepticaemia it is an extremely serious,\nlife-threatening condition.\nThese bacteria live naturally in the\nback of the nose and throat. They are\nDavid Hayton\nIC Health Centre Assistant GP\nnormally spread by close and prolonged contact by coughing, sneezing and intimate kissing (hence the\noutbreaks in the student population!).\nHowever catching or carrying the bacteria does not mean you will develop\nmeningitis or septicaemia; only occasionally do they overcome the immune\nsystem and cause these diseases. They\ndo not survive outside the body so they\ncannot be caught from buildings, toilets and swimming pools etc.\n\u2022 Dislike of bright lights\n\u2022 Drowsiness, confusion/disorienta-tion, fits\n\u2022 A rash that does not fade with the\nglass test\nPeople with septicaemia may develop a rash. This can start anywhere on\nthe body and look like tiny blood spots\n(like pin-pricks). These go on to join\ntogether to look like large bruises. The\nglass test can be used to see if a rash\nmight be due to septicaemia.\nPress the side of a drinking glass onto\nthe spot/bruise and see if it fades. A\nsepticaemia rash does not usually fade\n(although it is possible that the rash\nmay fade at first but later change into\none that does not \u2013 check again later).\nDo not wait for a rash. It may be the\nlast symptom or may not appear at all.\nSince people with these diseases can\nbe very unwell and unable to seek help,\nwe need to keep an eye on each other.\nIf you are unwell yourself, make sure\nsomeone knows you are ill.\nWe all need to be aware of the symptoms and many have a low threshold\nfor seeking help. It is of course far\nbetter to be safe than sorry. However,\nthese symptoms are very common and\npanic is never helpful.\nIf you are aware of the symptoms\nabove, and suspect someone may have\nmeningitis or septicaemia, call for help\nas soon as possible.\nTo help prevent meningitis and sep-ticaemia, get yourself vaccinated! We\ncannot stress this enough. Although it\nis a common misconception that those\nwho have had the meningitis vaccination cannot get meningitis, the vaccination does significantly reduce your\nchances of getting this serious disease.\nFurthermore, the more students that\nget the vaccination, the fewer cases\nwill occur \u2013 even in those who have\nnot been vaccinated (it\u2019s called herd\nimmunity).\nIf you are under 25, you can get\nthe MenC vaccine at the Imperial\nCollege Health Centre for free\nThankfully, meningitis and meningo-coccal septicaemia are rare. They may\nbe difficult to spot as symptoms are\nsimilar to those of flu. Look out for:\n\u2022 High temperature, fever, possibly\nwith cold hands and feet\n\u2022 Vomiting, sometimes diarrhoea\n\u2022 Severe headaches\n\u2022 Neck stiffness (unable to touch the\nchin to the chest)\n\u2022 Joint or muscle pains, sometimes\nwith stomach cramps\nThe current StudentSay website at www.studentsay.co.uk\nMeningococcus bacteria.

This only\nseemed to fuel King\u2019s Medicals as they\nincreased the intensity and they started\nto dominate in the forwards, often giving the Imperial forwards a lot of grief\nin the scrums.\nImperial, however, were very quick\nto pounce on any mistakes that King\u2019s\nMedicals made, with captain Andrew\nJasudasen scooping up a loose lineout\nball in the oppositions 5 meter line and\nscoring a try. The conversion was un-successful. Imperial led 8 \u2013 0.\nAgain King\u2019s Medicals increased the\npressure, with a lot of flowing rugby\nfrom their backs, often breaking the\nImperial defensive line. After some\nsustained pressure, King\u2019s Medicals\nwere finally rewarded with a penalty,\nwhich was converted, leaving the score\nat 8 \u2013 3. The opposition\u2019s forwards kept\nmaintaining the pressure on the Imperial pack, both in the scrum and in the\nline-outs, which gave an excellent platform for their backs to run. If it wasn\u2019t\nfor a try-saving tackle by Alex JohnKing\u2019s Medicals fall to IC\nRugby\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XV 13\nKing\u2019s Medicals 1st XV 3\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nstone in the corner, the medics could\nhave gone into the lead at half time.\nAfter some serious contemplation at\nhalf time from the captain and coach,\nthe side went into the second half feeling as if they had something to prove.\nThis was immediately seen from the\nforwards, where they finally retaliated\nto the onslaught from the opposition\nby winning their own scrum and severely distrupting the King\u2019s Medicals\nones. But the surge didn\u2019t stop there,\nwith the forwards running some great\nattacking, powerful runs through the\ncentre, predominantly from the props\nJovan Nedi\u0107 and fresher Terry Addo.\nThe forwards were then shown to be\nextremely versatile with vice-captain\nand flanker Flannan O\u2019Mahony showing his kicking skills by setting up a\nnice chip and chase, only to be foiled\nby the rest of the pack who were too\nbemused by what was happening in\nfront of them.\nThe 20 minutes of sustained pressure from the Imperial forwards gave\nan excellent platform for their backs\nto show their magic, and it was clearly\nsomething that King\u2019s Medicals could\nnot cope with as their scrum half was\nsin-binned for a late tackle on the fly-half. Imperial took advantage of the\nextra man and after breaking through\nthe middle of the field, the ball was\neventually off loaded to Tom Carroll\nwho scored a try giving Imperial a 13\n\u2013 3 victory.\nMan of the match went to Jovan\nNedi\u0107 for the constant barrage of runs\nto the King\u2019s Medicals line, and Twat of\nthe Match went to James Fletcher for a\ncross-field kick that landed neatly into\nthe oppositions wingers hands.\nAlthough a victory, there is clearly a\nlot of room for improvement, especially in terms of line-outs, if the side ever\nexpect to win the league. Hopefully\nthis will be noticeable next week.\nThe Imperial forwards getting stuck in with King\u2019s Medicals\nLSE Men\u2019s 1st v ICU Men\u2019s 1st\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd v Hertfordshire Men\u2019s 2nd\nCambridge Women\u2019s 1st v ICU Women\u2019s 1st\nCantebury CC Women\u2019s 1st v ICU Women\u2019s 2nd\nFootball\nICU Men\u2019s 1st v Westminster Men\u2019s 1st\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd v Royal Free Men\u2019s 1st\nSussex Men\u2019s 3rd v ICU Men\u2019s 3rd\nHockey\nICU Men\u2019s 1st v Royal Free Men\u2019s 1st\nICU Men\u2019s 2nd v Bucks Chilterns UC Men\u2019s 1st\nRoyal Holloway Men\u2019s 4th v ICU Men\u2019s 3rd\nKingston Men\u2019s 2nd v ICU Men\u2019s 4th\nICU Women\u2019s 2nd v King\u2019s Women\u2019s 1st\nLacrosse\nKing\u2019s 1st v ICU 1st\nNetball\nICU 1st v Greenwich 1st\nICU 2nd v St Bart\u2019s & London 2nd\nRugby Union\nBrunel Men\u2019s 1st v ICU Men\u2019s 1st\nPortsmouth Men\u2019s 3rd v ICU Men\u2019s 2nd\nEssex Men\u2019s 3rd v ICU Men\u2019s 3rd\nWrittle Women\u2019s 1st v ICU Women\u2019s 1st\nSquash\nICU Men\u2019s 1st v Queen Mary\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 2nd v ICU Men\u2019s 2nd\nKing\u2019s Women\u2019s 1st v ICU Women\u2019s 1st\nTable Tennis\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st v ICU Men\u2019s 1st\nTennis\nUCL Men\u2019s 1st v ICU Men\u2019s 1st\nICU Women\u2019s 1st v Kent Women\u2019s 1st\nVolleyball\nLSE Women\u2019s 1st v ICU Women\u2019s 1st\nMore results next week\n\n"

In the recent CGS UK finals at\n3 Mills Studios in Bromley, there was\na lot of talk about atmosphere, glamour and excite-ment, but little to\nno quality gaming.\nDespite the abundance of talent\npresent in the stu-dio, spread across\n4 different games,\nwith nearly all of\nthe UK\u2019s best players present at the\nevent, the CGS\u2019s\npared-down rules\nand TV-friendly\nformat compromised the principles of fair play\nand proving, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the\nwinner deserved\nto win.\nWith an impressive studio setup;\ngood hosts (MTV\u2019s Emma Griffiths\nand Dave Berry); a decent-sized audience for the remote location; a great\ncommentating team (gaming commentating stalwart ReDeYe, Quake 4\nprofessional 2GD and a few of Sky\u2019s\nown professional sports commenta-tors); and even glamour model Keeley\nHazell acting as ring-side girl, I expected the CGS to impress me more than\nany of the other tournaments I had\nattended in the past. However, after\nan hour\u2019s wait, my expectations were\nshattered as the evening\u2019s first contestants stepped up to the Xboxes, mounted on lit podiums front and centre, to\nplay FIFA07. Then they walked back\nand sat down again. And again, until finally the producers were happy. Keeley\nHazell stepped up, asked the contestants if they were ready and then blew\na whistle \u2013 applause was cued and the\naudience went wild.\nMy soul sank as I realized that this\nwasn\u2019t competitive gaming as I knew it.\nThere was no soul to the pro-ceedings; it was all optimized\nfor normal punters who couldn\u2019t tell\nHalo apart from Counter-Strike. The\nFIFA match was over in 5 minutes \u2013\nno best-of-3 was played as is usual for\nthe game, and the time limit was half\nof what it usually is. ChrisyB had won,\nBazza looked disappointed, but they\nwere given a cursory interview and\nthen ushered off.\nThe day continued in much the same\npattern, with gamers being brought\nup and with their duties performed,\nshown the door. The producers reigned\nsupreme here, with rules arbitrarily\nchanged for better watchability, with\nutter disregard for the fairness of the\nproceedings towards the gamers. They\nwere all here for a shot at a professional contract \u2013 being paid a salary for\nplaying games, what more could you\nwant? But simultaneously, they looked\ndismayed that these were the circumstances \u2013 where luck and a guy behind\nthe camera had more to do with success than actual skill.\nWithallthefinalshavingbeenplayed,\nwith mostly predictable results, the\ndraft was to follow, but the audience\nwas tired, hungry and thirsty, having\nsat in the studio without any breaks\nfor 3 hours. A short break was called,\nand the atmosphere was restored going into the draft. This was the main\nevent of the evening, where 20 players were to earn a spot on one or the\nother of the teams \u2013 the Birmingham\nSalvo or the London Mint \u2013 and a con-tract. Sujoy Roy, the London team\u2019s\nmanager and founder of ESReality.com\nand Omega Sektor LAN centre in Birmingham, had the first pick and chose\nChrisyB, the UK\u2019s premier FIFA player.\nMichael O\u2019Dell, manager of both Salvo\nand the dignitas professional gaming\nteam, then made 2 choices, and so it\ncontinued, back and forth, each manager getting 2 picks each turn, until 20\nplayers had been drafted \u2013 5 for Counter-Strike Source, 2 for Project Gotham Racing 3, 1 for FIFA 2007, 1 male\nand 1 female Dead or Alive 4 player for\neach team.\nThis was supposed to be a rivalry,\nbut with shooting time limited, the\nmatch-up between Salvo and Mint was\nthe next day, bringing into question the\nidea of there being a significant\nteam element to the proceedings.\nMostly, the UK team final would be a\nrepeat of yesterday\u2019s matches, since\nwith few exceptions the players in the\nindividual finals had been drafted. The\nrepeated match-ups all produced predictable results \u2013 essentially repeats of\nthe previous day\u2019s bouts, but the FIFA\nmatch turned out to be a thriller. With\nunderdog Bazza taking an unexpected\nlead against strong favourite ChrisyB\nlate into the game, only to be tied up\nin the very last seconds, and then losing in a penalty shootout, this was true\ncompetition. Individual men\u2019s DOA4\nchampion Messy ended up being defeated by long-time rival Padaman,\nleaving Birmingham Salvo in dire\nstraits, requiring their Counter-Strike\nsquad to win by absolute blow-out for\nSalvo to come out overall champions.\nUnfortunately, Mint squad 4Kings\nhad been underperforming all week\nand had finally found their stride \u2013 and\nwith the whole audience\u2019s loud support,\nthey stormed on to an early lead, which\nthey then held until the end, leaving\nBirmingham Salvo devastated. Overall\nteam scores: 31-19 in favour of\nthe Mint.\nWhile it\u2019s hard\nto argue that the\nevent was a fail-ure, its successes\nhad little to do\nwith the hosts or\n\u201ccyber babe\u201d Keeley, nor with the\nrehashed rule set,\nbut everything\nto do with actual\nexcitement about\nthe results.\nThe gaming\nwas exciting,\nand the ooh\u2019s\nand aah\u2019s during\nmatches were\nreal, not cued by a guy with a headset.\nThe question that needs answering if\nthe Championship Gaming Series is to\ncontinue is not \u201chow do we make this\nevent more spectacular?\u201d but \u201caren\u2019t\nwe forgetting the games?\u201d. With events\nlike QuakeCon, the Electronic Sports\nWorld Cup and the Cyberathlete Professional League all drawing large\nnumbers of spectators without resorting to TV antics and faked applause,\nthe CGS is approaching the sport from\nthe wrong angle. A free piece of advice\nfor the executives at the CGS \u2013 make\nthe gaming exciting and the spectators\nwill follow.\nBloxorz are teh roxxorz\nAzfarul Islam\nTrying to match a peg to the correctly\nshaped hole was probably a harrowing experience as a toddler unless you\nwere a prodigal wunderkind, or just\nplain lucky. Bloxorz channels the spirit\nof this noble task of old but with myriad spicy twists.\nThe objective is to manipulate a\nstandard oblong block such that it gently falls through a conveniently placed\nhole. Note the word \u2018conveniently\u2019. The\ncrux of the challenge lies in actually\ntransporting the block itself; there are\nobstacles and impediments abound.\nThis requires a good deal of spatial\nawareness and perception, although\nrandom luck (as before) can work\nmiracles sometimes. A combination of\nswitches, bridges and other wondrous\ndevices including the fact that you can\nfall off the edge all too easily are there\nto stay your progress. It can get quite\naddicting as you try to figure out the\ncorrect path for each stage \u2013 madden-ingly, there can be quite a few.

Is\nit very tiring? You\u2019re all very energetic on stage\u2026\nYannis \u2013 Yes, I\u2019m very tired.\nBut you still keep going?\nYeah, I got in a fight in Reading where\nI got my earring pulled out of my ear,\nand I\u2019ve got an ulcer. Our guitarist\nchipped his tooth, our bassist has two\nblack eyes and that\u2019s all just from the\nlast four days!\nThere\u2019s not going to be any cancelling of dates though?\nNo - there\u2019s no \u2018Plan B\u2019 for us!\nYou\u2019ve just recorded your new\nalbum (with Dave Sitek of TV on\nthe Radio in New York), which I\u2019m\nvery excited about. What was it\nlike working with Dave?\n(Jokingly) pretty unpleasant.\nDid he push you hard?\nIt was just a big ego clash!\nHopefully he knows what he\u2019s doing though\u2026\nYeah, he does. He\u2019s a good friend of\nmine now.\nAny idea of a release date?\nMarch sometime. There\u2019ll be some\nstuff released off it before, some singles\nand things.\nNew songs?\nWell, Balloons is the first single, and\nthat\u2019s an old one, but after that, yeah.\nWhy did you decide not to put\nsome of your older songs on the\nalbum? Have you moved on from\nthem?\nYeah, we always like to progress. We\nwrite prolifically, so it doesn\u2019t make\nsense to keep re-releasing the same\nsongs. I don\u2019t like albums where you\u2019ve\nheard four of the songs before because\nthen it doesn\u2019t feel like an album, it\u2019s\njust a collection of songs!\nI\u2019ve noticed listening to your older\nsongs on the demos that there\u2019s a\nbig difference between them and\nyour new singles\u2026\nYou think so? Really?\nDefinitely! Not only in the style,\nwhere I assume you didn\u2019t have\nmuch in the means of production\nfacilities available at the time,\nbut also structurally some of your\nsongs like \u2018Hummer\u2019 have changed\na lot from the demos.\nWell, we recorded that demo in a barn\nfor free!\nSo have the songs changed because you couldn\u2019t record them\nas you wanted to when you start-ed, or have they evolved as you\nplayed them live into something\ndifferent?\nDefinitely both.

Now to\nput that word into con-text, I am going to greet\nyou and say hello and welcome to the\nmusic section as it would normally\nappear. What I mean by that is that we\nhave reviews and an interview for you\nto peruse.\nFirst of all, Toby Prudden went to\ngo see Foals live at Scala in North\nLondon and managed to have a quick\nword with them before they per-formed. Foals have featured members\nof Edmund Fitzgerald and Youthmovie\nSoundtrack Strategies who were\n(and in the latter case, are) staples\nof the underground music scene in\nthis country over the past few years.\nFoals started off with three guitarists\nand utilised this to have interweaving\narpeggiated guitars with taut drums.\nOne guitarist was replaced with a\nkeyboardist and they expanded on\ntheir drummer\u2019s more upbeat style\nto produce polyrhythmic riffs with a\nfour-to-the-floor backbeat. They have,\nthrough constant touring and hard\nwork, attained quite a following.\nThank you to all of those who signed\nup to write, photograph, or edit Felix\nat Freshers\u2019 Fayre. We, as a section,\nwill be getting in touch but if you want\nto come meet us then come to the\nunion at 12:30 on Friday 12th October\n(ie. today); talk about short notice. You\ncan always e-mail us or come down\nto the Felix office in the West Wing of\nBeit Quad at any time (well, sensible\nhours) to find out more.\nWe would love to have as many\nreviews as possible or any form of\ncontribution. You can swag some\ninterviews with bands you like, free\nCDs and free entry into gigs that we\nget offered. It\u2019s all FREE, and you don\u2019t\nneed to prove anything other than\nyour enthusiasm and willingness to\nget involved. I don\u2019t get paid to do\nthis, nor does Jenny, so we are fuelled\non poor enthusiasm (and blood).\nAlso for those who don\u2019t know\nmuch about how the music industry\nworks, i.e. public relations, getting a\nrecord deal, putting out a record and\npublishing, then I will use this column\nto (sometimes cynically) explain the\ninner workings of the business of mu-sic. Appreciation of music is relative\nand only by having as many different\nreviews from as many people as possible can we get a greater picture or ap-preciation. However, the mechanisms\nand workings of the music industry\nare, for the most part, fact and strewn\nwith human influence (hence my cyni-cism) that can be commented.\nThere may not be a music section\nevery week depending on how much\nmaterial and/or time we have. It\nwould be wonderful if anyone would\nbe willing to take over as music editor\nas both Jenny and I are in our final\nyears. If you are interested in learning more about the inner workings of\ngetting gigs and free CDs or how to\nlay-out a page in a newspaper then\nplease e-mail us. Or if you want to just\nchat then get in touch.\n\u201cI think a live set\nis just meant to\nbe relentless and\nin your face and\nenergetic and\nviolent\u201d\nprogress, so I don\u2019t ever want to write\na song that sounds like Hummer ever\nagain. Not because I don\u2019t like it, but\nbecause I don\u2019t find the idea of stag-nancy enjoyable, and I don\u2019t understand why some bands do!\nSo do you think that if you were\nstill playing in five years\u2019 time you\nwould still play the \u2018classics\u2019 live,\nor would you be the kind of band\nthat only plays the new album?\nYeah, the live thing is different, I like\ndoing everything live. I think a live set is\njust meant to be relentless and in your\nface and energetic and violent, and that\nwill always be like that. I\u2019m interested\nin making records, and I think the live\nexperience is something that is pretty\nmuch divorced from that and they are\ntwo very separate arenas in which I\nperform. I enjoy both equally, but the\nprogression of the idea of what Foals is\nas a band is like a recorded thing. Live\nit is always going to have this energy. I\nhope so anyway!\nYou\u2019re supporting Bloc Party on\ntheir arena tour. Are you nervous?\nExcited?\nI get nervous when I leave my house\nso I\u2019m used to that! But yes, I do get\nnervous.\nDo you see yourself ever headlining venues that size?\nNo, not that size!\nLet me ask you about Youthmovies \u2013 you\u2019re good friends with\nthem\u2026\nYeah, best friends! Andrew (Youthmovies\u2019 lead singer/guitarist) is my\nbest friend.\nHave you heard their album yet?\nHave they given you a copy?\nYeah, I have.\nWhat\u2019s it like? Give us the inside\ninformation!\n(Jokingly) Pretty rubbish!\nNothing like as good as yours I\nsuppose?\nNo, it\u2019s good! He is my best friend in\nthe whole world \u2013 I\u2019d take bullets for\nhim!\nCan you see a joint tour coming in\nthe future?\nYeah, possibly.\nAfter your last band, \u2018The Edmund\nFitzgerald\u2019, split up you said it was\nbecause it wasn\u2019t fun anymore. Do\nyou ever see that happening with\nFoals? Could you just get bored\nwith this and want to do something completely different? Could\nyou just drop it all and move on?\nYeah, definitely. If it got boring or if it\nwasn\u2019t fulfilling or I felt like we hadn\u2019t\nachieved what we should have then I\nwould stop. There is so much different stuff I want to do other than this,\nand it\u2019s the same for all of us. Our next\nrecord might just be \u2018Cello and drums,\nno guitars \u2013 but it will still be Foals. I\nthink there is something intrinsic to it\nthat will always be there, but the textures and the way we produce sounds\nmight be completely different. I find\nit really weird when people say \u2018I can\u2019t\nbelieve you put brass on your record\u2019\nor \u2018I can\u2019t believe there\u2019s no synths\non it\u2019 \u2013 because there isn\u2019t any. Why\nshould you be so offended with the way\nwe produce sounds? It will still sound\nlike us!\nHow would you do that live? If\nthe new songs have got brass on\nthem will you get a brass section\nto tour with you?\nI don\u2019t know, we have to try and sort\nthat out.\nYou have said before that you\nwrite songs for people to dance\nto. Would you write a song that\nyou couldn\u2019t dance to? A ballad\nmaybe?\nAbsolutely! There are songs on the album you can\u2019t dance to.\nOk, thanks for taking the time to\ntalk to us.\nNo problem!\n\n"

We\u2019re\nputting this record attendance and\nfabulous fun down to our wonderful\nguests and our break from tradition!\nI would also, personally, like to give a\nbig shout out to James Field, my Vice\nPresident (Activities) and all his little\nminions who worked so hard to ensure\nwe had a fantastic night!\nBuddies\nOur buddy schemes have been kicking off in the science departments this\nyear with the aim to pair up a fresher\nwith a big person to help them over\nany hurdles they might meet at Imperial. So if you\u2019re a big person then\nmake sure you look after your fresher\nand if you\u2019re a fresher then make use\nof your big person \u2013 whether you want\nadvice on courses, essay skills, or anything else! We would also like to point\nout that no one was hurt in the Krispy\nKreme doughnut wars which ensued\nduring the biology buddy meeting!\nBook Sale\nIn an effort to stop students being\ntoo badly crippled in the wallet when\nit comes to textbooks we continued\ndown the path of previous years and\nheld a second hand book sale whereby\nold students could sell their textbooks\non. This year we had over a thousand\nbooks put in for the sale and the majority disappeared in a flash last Tuesday 9th Oct (we probably would have\ncompletely sold out had it not been for\nthe Freshers\u2019 Ball the previous night!)\nOur Academic Affairs Officer Andreas\nEsau deserves many congratulations\nfor the hard work he put in! Next year\nwe might have to invest in a trolley seeing as we had to carry all those books\nfrom the union to our new office on\nthe Sherfield Walkway!\nElections\nWe have mop up elections for the few\npositions that were left unfilled last\nterm. So if you\u2019re a budding sports of-ficer, publicity & communications of-ficer, secretary, postgraduate research\nrep (in life sci and phys sci), biochemistry or joint maths and computing\ndepartment rep then please stand for\nelections at imperialcollegeunion.\norg/vote. Join the team! Nominations\nclose on the 14th October at 23.59!\nFor more information about elections\nplease email rcsu.president@impe-rial.ac.uk or see the website at www.\nrcsu.org.uk!\nJennifer Morgan\nPresident\nRoyal College of\nScience Union\nHow to smile\nS\nociety has gone mad. The\nstreets of London are full of\ndull, grey, pointless zombies.\nWe stare downwards when\nwe walk and make sure we\nare too fast for anyone to catch up with\nus. We don\u2019t talk on the tube, and if we\nare alone, most often we have a \u2018London Lite\u2019 clamped to our arms or we\nare listening to music to prevent any\nsocial interaction. I feel like we\u2019re all\nliving in a concrete bubble.\nOnce we get to work \u2013 what hap-pens? We are trapped in a race up\nthe ladder, to be better than our col-leagues, to prove what we have and\nwhat we\u2019ve learnt. That is the problem with our education system, our\nculture, our civilisation. From school\nPriya G\nwe are tutored in excelling individual\nand fighting each other off. There\u2019s little emphasis on teamwork apart from\ngroup sports and even then little pity\nis reserved for the opposing side. The\nfriends we make are unlikely to be our\nclosest contenders in our profession\nand even if that is so, if there were a\nchoice between progressing in a ca-reer, or salvaging a friendship, I believe\nmost people would choose their career.\nWhat a pitiable state of affairs when\nyou think back to why jobs were created in the first place. Human kind had\na need for certain materials in order\nto survive and those capable of doing\nthem did them. However, as technology advanced and money became more\nand more important, the competitive\nthirst arose in those who were able to\ncomplete isolate work from being an\nall round decent person.\nI find it impossible to understand\nhow you could plunge the knife in the\nback of a person you have been working with for the past week, let alone\nyear. Why can\u2019t we work together to\nfind solutions? Why do we always have\nto superior to somebody else? Why\ncan\u2019t we just appreciate the talents of\nour colleagues and ourselves?\nI believe it\u2019s time to get out of this rat\nrace. We need to stop comparing ourselves to other people and believe in\nourselves and what we are good at.\nWe need to slow down, take a deep\nbreath, look up for the sky for once and\nactually appreciate that we have a life,\nonly one, and that we should enjoy it.\nForget about work for just one day, stop\nrunning around and stressing about\ndeadlines and essays. A hundred years\nfrom now nobody will care whether we\nwere able to read that extra chapter.\nWe need to stop living for other people\u2019s expectations and for what we have\nbeen dictated to do.\nJust for once in our lives, we need to\nbe still, look at the trees, the plants, and\nthe world, watch the people around us,\nlook at how lucky we have it, and smile.\nSmile.\nLook past the grey for the blue and\nyou\u2019ll feel a million times better. I\npromise. If you are lucky, maybe someone will smile back! You won\u2019t know\nunless you try.\nI got beef with beef\nF\nor most of us in the western world clean water is a\nseemingly infinite resource\nand the only portal of exposure to calamities such\nas water-borne disease epidemics and\ndroughts is the news. But a change is\nimminent and sooner than one would\nexpect. At present, close to a third of\nthe world\u2019s population is plagued by\nwater crises. If current trends in water consumption continue, this figure\nis expected to augment to include two\nthirds of the globe by 2025.\nTo put further perspective on this\nfigure and its impact, consider a United Nations (UN) statement issued\nrecently which claims that access to\nwater will be reduced by a third of that\navailable today within the next two\ndecades \u2013 regardless of geographical\nlocation. To add further fuel to the fire,\nleading political economists are going\nso far as to predict a grizzly shift in the\nnature of global conflicts and discord\nfrom oil and politics to water. This may\nseem like an embroidered doomsday\nscenario, but current data is certainly\nvalidating it as a plausible notion.\nTo overcome such an eerie aftermath\nwhich could threaten the very foundation of humanity, we must first gather\nsome insight into the causes of water\ncrises. Presently, there is in fact enough\nwater to satisfy the needs of the entire\nglobal population, but there is a massive disparity in consumption between\nthe developed and developing worlds.\nFor instance here in London we each\nconsume in excess of a whopping 170\nliters of water per day on average in\npersonal usage, which far exceeds the\nUN Human Development Index prescribed 50 liters per day per domestic\nhousehold needed to maintain a minimum standard of living. On the other\nhand in some African countries, an\naverage household may barely receive\na fifth of this prescribed minimum and\nwhat they do get comes with heavy\nstrings attached such as life-threaten-ing illnesses including cholera.\nBesides excessive personal water us-age, it is the agricultural sector and the\nlavish patterns of food consumption in\nthe West which are further exacerbat-ingthewatercrisis.Exorbitantamounts\nof meat and dairy products have firmly\nestablished themselves as the mangy\nmainstays of the typical Western diet\nand their consumption now presents\nmore than just health risks.\nTending livestock and poultry\namongst other primary sector activities accounts for a massive 70 % of total water usage in the UK. To fathom\njust how much water is depleted from\nsuch activities, consider beef produc-tion, where a single kilogram of the\nmeat drains 15 cubic meters of precious H2\n0.\nBesides the obvious economic costs\nof depleted water supplies, there are\nthe bleak prospects of mass population displacement, famine and war. It\nseems that despite the grave long-term\nthreats it poses to our survival water\nwastage has not been deemed an urgent enough problem to be tackled\nin the general \u2018green shift\u2019 in governmental policy and corporate activity towards environmentally friendly\npractices.\nAs of now there is no legislation in\nBritain to limit water supplies to households unwilling to pay their water bills\nand neither have any serious measures\nbeen put in place to encourage homes\nor the farming sector to curb water\nconsumption. Talks of privatizing the\nwater supply in the UK has been met\nwith scathing criticism and heavy\nbacklash on grounds of depriving the\npopulation of a basic necessity. However, it seems that water will surely ascend in status to a luxury commodity if\nwe don\u2019t devise a viable method soon\nto stay within our aqueous means.\nUshnish Banerjee\nCattle: A huge waste of water?\n\u201c\nThe UN\npredicts that\nwater supplies\nwill reduce by a\nthird in 20 years\n\n"

Write for us\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRosie Grayburn\nArts Editor\nC\niao bellas! I hope your\nfirst \u2018real\u2019 week back has\nbeen highly enjoyable and\nlecture-filled. Snort, sniffle and cough, you all re-ply. That\u2019s right, we\u2019ve all come down\nwith the Lurgy.\nIt\u2019s the time of year when there is always a presence of phlegm and snot in\nthe lecture theatre. \u201cNiiiiice\u201d, you may\nall say, but before long you can bet your\nbottom dollar some experimental artist will have collected all your sodden\ntissues and turned it into the winning\ninstallation for the Turner Prize 2007.\nSpeaking of which, this prestigious\nprize is controversially being exhibited outside London for the first time\nin its 22-year history. No doubt to collide nicely with Liverpool being named\nEuropean Capital of Culture 2008, the\nshort-listed artwork is being shipped\nacross the Mersey to the Tate Liverpool from 19th October. Alas you will\nbe unable to view these innovative\npieces of visual art.\nThankfully the Tate Britain is putting\non an exhibition for all of us left be-hind, south of the divide. \u2018The Turner\nPrize: A Retrospective\u2019 will explore the\nhistory of the prize. Previous winners\nhave included Damien Hurst in 1995\nand who can forget the elephant dung\nof 1998?\nAnd so onto this week\u2019s gargantuan\nArt section: here to cure your malady\nwith a good dose of Millais, Lloyd\nWebber and Ancient Chinese History.\nHopefully it will cheer you up \u2013 especially those of you who downright\nrefused to buy the Aloe Vera tissues\nand now have developed some redness\naround your nozzle.\nWe sent out an army of writers to\nvarious galleries and theatres across\nthe Metropolis, from the Science Museum to Camberwell. They returned\nfrom their campaigns victorious and\ntheir exploits are here for your delight!\nOne of the most exciting additions\nto the city\u2019s calendar was the arrival\nof the Terracotta Army to the British\nMuseum a few weeks ago. Jenny Gibson reviews the much anticipated exhibition on the facing page. Highly recommended throughout the press and\nthus ridiculously hard to get tickets,\nbut make sure you go before the Army\nretreats back to its resting place in the\nQin region of China.\nMeanwhile Emily Wilson visited\nMillais\u2019 legacy at the Tate Modern\n(don\u2019t get the audio guide, boys and\ngirls) and Ling Chang Wong ventured\noff to the West End in search of new\ntalent.\nA lighthearted addition to the pages\nis \u2018Student Art in Focus\u2019, which hides\nunder one very opinionated lady\u2019s\ncriticism, as Lucy Harrold gives us an\nidea of why we shouldn\u2019t sit in on a Saturday night and watch \u2018How to Solve\na Problem like Maria\u2019. Exactly. I quite\nagree. We should go forth and imbibe\nsome freshly squeezed culture instead.\nYummy.\nSex, lies and audio guides\nPre-Raphaelite god, Millais, exhibits at the Tate Britain \u2013 Emily Wilson investigates\nI\nf your scientific workload is bogging you down this winter, why\nnot take a break and indulge\nyour artistic side? Running until\n13th January 2008 at Tate Britain is Millais, a major exhibition of the\nlife and works of the artist John Everett\nMillais.\nFor those unfamiliar with the London art scene, Tate Britain is the older,\nless glamorous sibling of Tate Modern. Just across the river from the MI6\nbuilding that Pierce Brosnan launches\nout of for the \u2018Q boat chase scene\u2019 in\n\u2018The World is Not Enough\u2019, Tate Britain is a short walk from Pimlico tube\nstation (assuming you don\u2019t go on a\nweekend when the Victoria line turns\nout to be closed, as I did \u2013 whoops). It\u2019s\nfree to get into the main galleries, but\nconsequently all the bonus extras like\nfood, drink, exhibitions and souvenirs\nare pricey. For Millais, student entry is\n\u00a39.\nOn my visit I also forked out for the\naudio-guide at the concession price of\n\u00a33. I would not recommend this unless\nyou want to be patronized and have\nmedieval-esque music inflicted upon\nyou, all while wearing uncomfortable\nheadphones. You\u2019re better off flicking\nthrough the free guide booklet that\ncame with your ticket and referring to\nthe handy labels beside every painting.\nJohn Everett Millais (1829-1896)\nstarted out as a child prodigy, becoming the youngest ever student of the\nRoyal Academy of Art at the age of 11,\nbut as a young man he came to rebel\nagainst the constrictive styles he was\ntaught to follow. He was a founding\nmember of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, along with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt. These\nartists reverted to the style of art that\nexisted before Raphael, favouring\nbright colours and crude honesty, while\nmaintaining precision and discipline\nin their drawing. Millais was quick to\noffend the artistic establishment \u2013 for\nexample \u201cChrist in the House of His\nParents\u201d, depicting a down-to-earth\nfamily scene of Jesus, Joseph and a very\nhaggard Mary, was considered highly\noffensive for its harsh realism.\nMany of Millais\u2019 works are based\non classic tales of lovers torn apart\nby circumstance, all doomed to come\nto tragic ends. Behind the embracing\ncouples are colourful images of nature,\noften used for symbolic meaning. In\n\u201cOphelia\u201d, an iconic image of a beautiful woman drifting to her death in a\nriver, poppies represent her imminent\ndemise while daisies represent her\nyouth and innocence.\nIf this arty-farty nonsense is already\nboring you, distract yourself with the\nmore entertaining side of Millais\u2019 art.\n\u201cThe Return of the Dove to the Ark\u201d\nis, basically, a painting of a woman\nkissing a pigeon (as you do) while her\nchum looks on in disgust. And there\u2019s\nplenty of sex too \u2013 \u201cMariana\u201d is all\nabout erotic yearnings and longings\nfor physical passion. Millais himself\nstole his subject and wife, Effie, away\nfrom her loveless and notoriously sexless marriage to the famous Victorian\nart critic John Ruskin. Millais also offers a worrying number of portraits of\nyoung girls, capturing their innocence\nof childhood but also their emerging\nsensuality (!). Look out for the politics\nin his art also, which originates from\nthe same era as Marx\u2019s Communist\nideologies. The Pre-Raphaelites were\nfrequently very socialist, as evident in\n\u201cThe Blind Girl\u201d, a portrait of a young\nblind vagrant.\nDespite all this scandal, Millais did\nseem to sell out later in his career. Passion and symbolism fade out into the\nstuffy portraits of the rich and famous\nthat made Millais the wealthiest artist\nof his time, earning as much as \u00a330,000\na year. As the collection progresses it\u2019s\neasy to tire of him, especially the entire\nroom filled with gloomy landscapes of\nthe Scottish Highlands. A slightly anticlimactic end to what was otherwise a\nthoroughly enjoyable exhibition.\nWhile you\u2019re at Tate Britain, don\u2019t\nforget the permanent collections \u2013\nunlike Millais it\u2019s all free. These feature British art ranging from Tudor\nand Stuart portraiture to Constable,\nTurner and some delightfully hideous\nLucian Freud nudes. If you enjoyed\nMillais, and you think the PRB might\nbe right up your street, pop into room\n14 for a couple of Rossettis and a bit of\nFord Madox Brown.\nMillais is on at the Tate Britain\nuntil 13th January 2008.\n\u201cMust\u2019ve done my back in when I wasn\u2019t at the Millais exhibition.\u201d\nMillais\u2019 beautiful yet haunting depiction of Ophelia floating away from sanity and life... shivers\n\n"

Go on, indulge me.\nHave you ever wanted to go toe-to-toe with the President in a boxing\nring?\nHas one of the Deputy Presidents\never restricted your club\u2019s spending,\nmaking you want to rugby tackle him\nto the ground, subsequently followed\nby a massive bundle of hulking great\nprops?\nHas one of the Deputy Presidents got\none of those faces that you just want to\nshoot with your paintball gun? Or perhaps one of the DPs is so beautiful you\nreally want to paint a glorious picture\nof them but you\u2019re afraid to ask in case\nyou come across as some kind of freak\nstalker.\nMaybe you\u2019re fed up of hearing about\nhow one of the Deputy Presidents is off\non yet another gruelling fund-raising\nadventure and what you\u2019d really like\nto see is one of them doing something\nthat is actually challenging. Land\u2019s End\nto John O\u2019Groats? Rubbish. Try scaling\nthe French Alps you big sissy.\nAre you so fed up with the amount of\nspelling mistakes in Felix that you want\nthe Editor to take a literacy test?\nOr do you just want to sit down with\none of the helpful, lovable Sabbaticals\nand play a game of chess or backgammon with them?\nI think you\u2019re probably getting the\nidea now, so I can answer your original\nquestion:\n\u201cWhat the hell is Challenge the\nSabbs?\u201d\nChallenge the Sabbs is about taking\non the Sabbatical Officers at whatever\ngame you can think of. You might want\nto have a drinking competition against\na number of them, you might want to\nget a bit more physical with them and\nplay a game of tennis, or you might\nwant to come up with something completely different. In fact, we actively\nencourage you to do just that. Think\nhard. Come up with the most imaginative variation on a well known game\nand we\u2019ll jump at the chance to beat\nyou at it. A report \u2013 probably a biased\none \u2013 will be written up after the challenge has taken place and the winner\nwill be announced. Over the course of\nthe year, a running tally will be kept\nand we\u2019ll see whether the student body\ncan match the Sabbaticals\u2019 prowess.\nWho is eligible to submit a\nchallenge?\nAnyone! That means clubs, societies,\nindividual students and even the Rector if he fancies it.\nWhilst Challenge the Sabbs is clearly\nsuited towards the clubs and societies of Imperial, anyone can submit a\nchallenge. For instance, if you\u2019re really\ngood at unicycle riding but there is no\nclub associated with your particular\ntalent, you\u2019re free to take us on.\nSimilarly, we\u2019re happy to take on\ngroup challenges as long as we can get\nthe Sabbs together in one place, at the\nsame time!\nI\u2019ve got an idea for a challenge,\nwhat next?\nGreat! Next you need to email Tom\nRoberts on felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nTell him all about your challenge, how\nmany Sabbs will be needed and perhaps even suggest a time and a place.\nIf for instance your club practises on a\nset night each week, let us know and\nwe\u2019ll see if we can get a team of Sabbs\ntogether for that evening.\nOnce you\u2019ve sent the email, you\u2019ll\nprobably get a bundle back and there\u2019ll\nbe some more questions asked. We\u2019ll\nthen finalise the rules of the challenge\nif it\u2019s not completely obvious.

We are particularly looking for goalkeepers, (male\nor female, experienced pro, ex-cricket\nwicket keeper, or just someone that\nway inclined) For more information see\nwww.imperialhockey.co.uk, or you can\njust join us in the bar on a Wednesday.\nToo many \u201cCV clubs\u201d at IC?\nAt the recent Clubs and Societies Board\n(CSB) meeting an issue was raised as\nto the formation of new clubs. There is\na fear that many of the new clubs that\nform, purely exist for the personal gain\nof those that founded it, and it seems\nto be particularly evident within the\nmedical faculty.\nThe issue was raised when nominations for the New Clubs Committee\n(NCC) were about to be held at the CSB\nmeeting on the 9th October. Creation\nof any new clubs or societies would\nhave to go straight to the NCC where\nthey would decide if the club or society\nwould become part of the union.\nGuy Martin, the medical clubs and\nsocieties president, raised the fact that\nmany of the medical clubs that have\nbeen formed in the last couple of years,\nhave had to be shut down since they\nwere considered to be inactive. The reality is that final and penultimate year\nmedical students would create a new\nclub just so they could use it on their\nCV, and hence have a better chance of\ngetting a job once they graduate. One\nsuch club that was mentioned was the\nTropical Medicine Society, however\nit was suggested that there might be\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nmany more.\nIt was suggested that the NCC should\nconsult the relevant faculty as to the validity and intention of the clubs, before\nthey were granted union membership\nstatus. This would, in hindsight, stop\nthe so called \u2018CV clubs\u2019 being formed\nand waste union money that could be\nused elsewhere.\nThe NCC itself would consist of one\nmember from the faculty unions, one\nclubs and societies chair and a final\nmember from the CSB. The elected\nmembers of the NCC were Tim Wills,\nthe Medical Student Union President,\nAndy Mason and Eugene Chang.\nHopefully common sense will prevail\nand that all these new \u2018CV clubs\u2019 will be\nexposed earlier, before valuable Union\nmoney is spent on creating attractive\nCV\u2019s for people who are too lazy to get\ninvolved in a proper club or society.

    "content": "30 felix Friday 12 October 2007\n30 felix Fr\nBrace yourself\n\u201cS\nkydiving? You must\nbe joking! Me, jump\nout of that plane\nthere? No, way.\nThat\u2019s for two types\nof people, the Bear Grylls ex-SAS\ntype, and the insane.\nYou couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\nPsychologists initially believed\nthat skydivers were insane, too.\nThat those involved with the sport\nhad some kind of latent death wish or a\nneed to prove themselves to their peers\nby performing high risk activities. Sort\nof like in Top Gun, but without the\nhomosexual overtones of the beach\nvolleyball scene. However, a study\nof 293 high-risk competitors\n(including skydivers) by Ben Ogilvie,\nprofessor emeritus of psychology at\nSan Jose State University, suggested that the average skydiver was\nhighly motivated and had above\naverage intelligence. These high\nachievers were more likely to\ntake calculated risks in order to\nachieve their goals when compared\nto their more conservative counter-parts, hence their attraction to the\nsport. Does this sound like anyone you\nknow? (Stop looking around. I\u2019m talking about YOU.)\nPeople from all walks of life skydive.\nIn Dan Poynter\u2019s Parachuting: A Skydiver\u2019s Handbook [Para Publishing,\n2003] we see that skydivers mostly\ncome from middle management, finance and IT backgrounds \u2013 so they\u2019re\ngeeks basically! Furthermore, a significantly larger percentage of skydivers\nhave gone to university compared\nto the proportion of the general\npopulation who have. Clearly\nthe skydiving community\nisn\u2019t filled\nwith a bunch of\nyahoo\u2019s randomly\njumping out of commercial airlines whenever they wish. Skydivers have families, they\nlike tea -- and they can be quite\nboring when they start talking about\nwing loading (the ratio of weight to\nthe area of the surface of the canopy\nabove them *yawn*).\nOK, so I\u2019d be lying if I said that skydiving was completely safe. There is an\nelement of risk and that is part of the\nreason it is so much fun. The important thing to realise is that this risk is\nmanageable. The British Parachute Association (BPA) [http://www.bpa.org.\nuk] currently puts the injury rate for\nexperienced skydivers at 0.4 per 1000\njumps and the fatality rate at about 1\nin 100,000 jumps. Let\u2019s just think about\nthese figures for a while. An injury can\nbe anything from a scratch or a bruise\nright the way through to sprains, fractures and breakages. Thankfully the\nmajority of injuries are minor such as\na twisted ankle through an awkward\nlanding. So, as an experienced skydiver\nperforming routine jumps, statistically\nyou are likely to injure yourself once\nevery 2500 jumps. I can live with that.\nNow, what about fatalities. Fatality rate\nis awkward to compare from year to\nyear since the number is so small compared to the total number of descents\nmade. You must also factor in that there\ncan be underlying reasons for death\nwhich are not attributable to skydiving directly -- such as heart attacks and\nother medical problems. Even taking\nall of this into account the fatality rate\nis still one in a hundred thousand or\n0.00001%. Pretty low don\u2019t you think?\nManageable even? I think so.\nSo what is it that makes the sport relatively safe? The answer is simple. Good\ninstruction, a willingness to learn and\ngood equipment. Skydiving has been\nan international sport since 1951 and\nsince then the equipment has come a\nlong way. All skydivers are equipped\nwith not one but two parachutes called\nthe main and reserve. The main is used\non a day-to-day basis and is packed by\nyourself whilst the reserve is used only\nin the case of a genuine emergency\nsuch as a main failure. This reserve\nis packed meticulously by a certified rigger, an expert in parachutes and their operation, and\nmust be repacked routinely to be sure\nthat it will be there when you need it.\nSafety measures don\u2019t stop here either.\nAll students in the UK are required to\njump with parachutes fitted with an\nAutomatic Activation Device (AAD)\nso that, in the rare event that you cannot or do not pull your main para-chute, your reserve will fire automatically when you fall below a particular\naltitude at a particular speed. All of\nthis high tech equipment is explained\nto you by expert instructors before you\never see a plane.\nSo maybe I\u2019ve convinced some of you\nnow? You want to make a\njump, so that you can phone\nhome and scare your parents to\ndeath. \u201cWhat have we done, sending our beloved Johnny off to Imperial College... he\u2019s going to jump out of\na plane!\u201d they\u2019ll say, but still you don\u2019t\nsee how it can be a sport? Well it is.\nThere are several active disciplines\nwithin the sport at the moment. The\ntwo most popular ones that occur during freefall (that\u2019s the sixty seconds or\nso that occurs after you peel off\nof the side of the plane and be-foreyouopenyourparachute)\n\u201ca study at\na study at\nSan Jose State\nSan Jose State\nUniversity\nUniversity\nsuggested that\nsuggested that\nthe average\nthe average\nskydiver had\nskydiver had\nabove average\nabove average\nintelligence\nintelligence\u201d\n\u201d\nSee those three people?

    "content": "fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFashion\nFashion Editor \u2013 Sarah Skeete\nCleaning up fashion\nI\nt\u2019s challenging to live an ethical\nlifestyle, ethical clothing and\nfashion don\u2019t necessarily go to-gether. Most people don\u2019t want\nto buy clothing made in a sweat-shop. But that doesn\u2019t mean they want\nto spend \u00a3100 on a hemp and organic\ncotton sweater. It\u2019s difficult to find\nethical clothes that are fashionable and\nleave you enough cash to eat.\nDespite growing demand for ethical\nclothing, high street shops pay their\nfactory workers pittance. However\nthey\u2019re happy to give \u00a33 Million to Kate\nMoss for ripping off the clothes in her\nwardrobe. It seems naive to blame Kate\nMoss for the pittance factory workers\nget paid, however she is a symptom of\nhow little companies value branding\ntheir clothes sweatshop-free.\nIt\u2019s true, that were Kate Moss and\nall the CEOs, to decrease their wages\nand increase the wages of their work-ers, the world might be a happier place.\nBut there doesn\u2019t seem to be any will to\ndo this. It\u2019s easy for clothing companies\nthemselves to pass their responsibility\nto the governments of the countries\nthey produce in.\nSome companies claim that they\u2019re\nbeing ethical by paying the minimum\nwage in the country they produce in.\nHowever globalisation pressurises\ncountries to reduce the minimum\nwage to below the living wage level.\nIf they don\u2019t decrease their wages, the\ncompanies go elsewhere. They have a\nchoice; wages that keep people locked\ninto poverty, or unemployment. The\ncountry with the best exchange rate,\nand the lowest standards wins. If wages were raised above the market rate,\nthen it would be a distortion of the free\nmarket. But poverty isn\u2019t something\nthe market should compete on. Ideally\nevery country should have the living\nwage as it\u2019s minimum wage, but this is\nunlikely to be enforced in reality.\nIf companies were to raise the wages\nof their factory workers higher than the\nmarket rate, they\u2019d have to decrease\nwages elsewhere or raise the price of\ntheir clothes and be less competitive.\nBut if the will is there, it is possible\nto pay a fair wage and make a profit, as\nproved by American Apparel. A sweat-shop-free, vertically-integrated com-pany, American Apparel sells American style basics like T-shirts at decent\nprices. Because American Apparel is\nvertically-integrated, with factories\nlocated in Los Angeles near the main\ncorporate building, it\u2019s easy to monitor\nstandards for garment workers.\nSince most multinational companies\noutsource to factories across the world,\nit\u2019s difficult to monitor how much\nworkers are actually being paid and\nworking standards in their factories.\nThe problem doesn\u2019t just lie with the\ncompanies not paying higher wages to\nfactories. Many factory owners earn a\ncomfortable amount while their workers struggle with a below-living wage.\nSome factories keep two wage-books,\none shown to companies inspectors,\nand one with workers actual wages.\nOthers keep workers overtime and\nthen refuse to pay them.\nThe workers are often in a desperate situation and are forced to accept\nbelow-living wages because of their\ncircumstances. Any attempts to form\nunions usually result in being fired\nfrom jobs which these workers are dependent on.\nMaybe it\u2019s just a case of consumer de-mand. As people become more aware\nof the conditions facing clothing factory workers, perhaps demand will grow\nfor sweatshop-free clothes. At present\nmost ethical clothing brands charge\na premium for being sweatshop-free.\nWhen there\u2019s a choice between an ethical pair of jeans costing \u00a3100 by Edun\n(Bono\u2019s ethical clothing range), and a\npair of high street jeans costing \u00a330, a\nlot of people can\u2019t afford to be ethical.\nWith Jane Shepherdson (the architect of the rise of Topshop) joining the\nethical brand People Tree maybe ethical brands will start getting a bit more\nmarket-friendly. Whilst People Tree\u2019s\nethical policy is great, the collections\nare static and look like something a\ntraveller (not tourist) who follows a\nmacrobiotic diet would wear. There\u2019s\na growing gap in the market for af-fordable, fashionable sweatshop-free\nclothes, waiting to be exploited.\nFor the Let\u2019s Clean Up Fashion report\nand to join the email campaign calling\non the government to regulate compa-nies, check out www.waronwant.org\nThe oxymoron of ethical fashion, is it all hemp and mung beans?\nModel of the week\nWorst offenders:\nBhs, Diesel, House of Fraser,\nKookai, Matalan, MK One, Moss\nBross, Mothercare, Peacocks/\nBon Marche, River Island, Rohan Designs, Ted Baker.\nSpring RTW 2008\nMust\nConsume\nPanel Box Bag (with chain)\n\u00a325, Topshop\nHigh\nFashion\nHotness\nBalencia, \u00a3 silly money\nValentine\nFillol\nMiu Miu\nLanvin\n25\nFriday 12 October 2007 felix\n\n"

These are musicals consisting\nof songs by famous artists or groups\nput into a musical format, ranging\nfrom the cheesy and longest running\u2018Mamma Mia!\u2019 to more rock orientated\nshows such as \u2018We Will Rock You\u2019 (the\nQueen Musical) and the soon-to-open\n\u2018Desperately Seeking Susan\u2019 (based on\nthe music of Blondie). Although I\u2019m\nnot a personal fan of this form of musi-cal, they\u2019re at least a way of getting reluctant friends to a show.\nIn the past year there has also been\na recent influx of new American musicals that have all had critical and financial success on Broadway. \u2018Avenue Q\u2019,\n\u2018Wicked\u2019 and \u2018Spamalot\u2019 all arrived last\nyear, and having seen all three, each appeals to a different type of person who\nwould not normally like musicals.\nAdd to that \u2018Hairspray\u2019 which begins\npreviewsonOctober11thfollowingthe\nsuccess of the film version, and you\u2019re\nspoiled for choice. Yet everybody still\ninsists they have to see \u2018Phantom of\nthe Opera\u2019 or \u2018Joseph and his Amazing\nTechnicolor Dreamcoat\u2019. Both of these\nplay in theatres owned by the Lord\nhimself, showing a false sense of secu-rity, as we cannot know how well his\nshows are doing. Yet there are many\nmore shows in the West End, although\nfew original scores.\nThere are also many more writers\nthan Lloyd Webber, some well established such as Kander and Ebb (\u2018Chicago\u2019) and new exciting imports from\nAmerica such as \u2018Avenue Q\u2019 writers\nRobert Lopez and Jeff Marx (-these\nguys also wrote the Scrubs musical\nepisode!)\nAsk most people in Britain to name\na musical and they\u2019re guaranteed to\nanswer with an Andrew Lloyd Webber- or rather a musical they think is\nby him. No matter how much he likes\nto make out, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 was\nNOT written by Andrew Lloyd Webber- neither was \u2018Les Miserables\u2019, or\n\u2018Miss Saigon\u2019.\nAnd even then, he only writes the\nmusic for his shows. Tim Rice or Don\nBlack usually write the lyrics, so if it\u2019s\nthose poetic words you like so much\nabout \u2018Cats\u2019 (well that was T.S. Elliot)\nor \u2018Aspects of Love\u2019, that wasn\u2019t him\neither. It\u2019s not even as if he is the only\nBriton to have ever written a musical,\nWilly Russell\u2019s \u2018Blood Brothers\u2019 has\nbeen running for 19 years, and Richard O\u2019Brien (that bald guy off \u2018Crystal Maze\u2019) wrote \u2018The Rocky Horror\nShow\u2019- the ultimate Cult musical. So\nwhy is Webber seen as the saviour of\nthe West End? And is his music really\nthat great?\nThe responsibility for the success of\nthe Lloyd Webber musicals actually\nlies with Cameron Mackintosh- the\ntrue saviour of British Musical Theatre. He produced all those big dramatic\nmusicals from the eighties; Webber\u2019s\n\u2018Phantom\u2019, \u2018Joseph\u2019, \u2018Starlight Express\u2019\nand \u2018Cats\u2019 as well as Boubil and Sch\u00f6nbergs\u2019 \u2018Les Miserables\u2019 and \u2018Miss Saigon\u2019. These were all high grossing but\nnot that favoured by critics, so many\nare left divided on the issue. If Mackintosh hadn\u2019t come along, Webber would\nnever have had enough exposure to get\nthings off the ground.\nI must admit that not all Webber is\nbad, the second half of \u2018Jesus Christ\nSuperstar\u2019 is pretty amazing. \u2018Evita\u2019\nisn\u2019t bad and I have to love \u2018Starlight\nExpress\u2019 for the cheese and sexual innuendo (it was also the second musical\nI ever saw). But in the case of decent\nmusical score, \u2018JCS\u2019 was his second\nmusical and \u2018Evita\u2019 his fourth. After\nthis, it appears that Lloyd Webber just\nrecycles his melodies with someone\nelse adding new lyrics. Examples of\nWARNING! The above image of the radiant Julie Andrews is NOT\ntaken from an Andrew Lloyd Webber show\nStudent Art in Focus\nthis include: \u201cClose Every Door to Me\u201d\nfrom \u2018Joseph\u2019 echoing Judas\u2019 betrayal\nand death from \u2018Jesus Christ Superstar\u2019.\n\u201cLove Changes Everything\u201d is found in\n\u201cI Believe My Heart\u201d from \u2018The Woman\nin White\u2019 (Webber\u2019s latest musical and\none of his only flops). \u201cAll I Ask of You\u201d\nfrom Phantom takes its melody from\n\u201cWith One Look\u201d from \u2018Sunset Boulevard\u2019. I\u2019m not saying there is anything\nwrong with these melodies, but surely\nthe point of furthering musical theatre\nis to try new and different ideas?\nSo the future of British musical theatre is left in the hands of a man who has\ntaken to finding his lead actors through\nreality television.

    "content": "31\nFriday 12 October 2007 felix\nare formation and freefly.\nAn example of formation would\nbe 4-way. That\u2019s a team of four people who exit the aircraft together and\nmake formations in the sky in a belly\nto earth position (otherwise known as\na flat position earning them the name\nflat fliers). Scores are awarded based\non how many formations or points the\nteam makes during their working time,\nbefore they separate and deploy their\nparachutes. A good 4 way team is a joy\nto watch. Quick and meticulous. Like\na machine, albeit one that is hurtling\ntowards the earth at 140mph. Then\nthere is freefly, an artistic discipline.\nOften done in a couple, but not always.\nThink Torvill and Dean on crack.\nThere is no restriction on the\nposition of the skydiver in freefall. They may\nbe head down and spinning\nlike a helicopter -- their legs\nacting like blades, or they may be\nsitting and carving around a central\npoint of reference. The sky is the limit\n(or the ground is) and all manoeuvres\nare judged on their difficulty and artistic merit.\nPeople continually ask me \u201cWhat is\nit like? Do you feel like you are falling?\u201d\nThe short answer is no. It\u2019s more like\nfloating on a noisy bed of air. Once\nyou have hit your horizontal terminal\nvelocity in a position there is no accel-eration. Even as you are accelerating\ndownwards towards your terminal it\ndoesn\u2019t feel like it since you are slowing down in the horizontal axis (you\nare still moving forward when you exit\nat the same speed as the plane).\n\u201cBut I\u2019m scared of heights?\u201d This\nis unlikely to be a hindrance. Do\nyou feel high when you are in a\ncommercial airliner? If not, you\nare unlikely to feel that in freefall\nsince your perspective changes so\nslowly you never really experience the\nsensation of falling, and you are happily under canopy before the ground\never rushes up to meet you. \u201cWhat\nif I don\u2019t like it?\u201d Well, that\u2019s a possibility but put it this way; I\u2019ve never seen\nanyone come down who wasn\u2019t smil-ing. If you are really nervous you could\nalways come to the tunnel with us?\nThis simulates the experience of\nfreefall, without the falling! The\nidea is that a jet of air is blown\nup to meet you and this suspends you in a vertical column.\nIt\u2019s cheaper than skydiving,\nless nerve-wracking and\ngives us the opportunity\nto try things out on\nthe ground, before\nputting them\ninto practice\nin the air.\nHopefully,\nby now you\nare desperate to give\nitago,and\nmaybe you have a desire to\nbecome a qualified skydiver\nand join us high above Oxfordshire? Well, you are in luck.\nIC Parachuting and Skydiving exists\nto get you falling to earth as quickly as\npossible. You could do a tandem jump\nwith us where you are strapped to an\ninstructor? Or you could take the first\nsteps to qualification with the Ram Air\nProgression System (RAPS) or Advanced Freefall (AFF).\nRAPS is a scheme which many of\nour members have embarked on. For\nyour first jump you leave the aircraft at\na low altitude (3000ft) and your parachute is automatically deployed by a\ncord attached to the plane. The initial\njumps concentrate on a good exit\nposition and canopy handling (as\nyour canopy will be open as soon\nas you exit) so you won\u2019t experience freefall until later on in the\ncourse. Around twenty to thirty\njumps are required to graduate as\na solo skydiver. AFF is the quickest op-tion, which can get you qualified in a\nmatter of a week or so. Although it can\nbe more expensive, you do get to experience freefall immediately. The first\njump is from a normal exit altitude\n(12,500 - 15,000ft) with two instructors holding on to you throughout.\nAfter a sequence of eight jumps, each\nprogressively harder than the next,\nyou will be qualified to exit alone to\nperform your consolidation jumps.\nAfter a further ten are completed you\nare qualified. Off to the bar! While\neach system has advantages and disadvantages both lead to an FAI \u2018A\u2019 licence\nwhich is recognised world wide.\nSo do you think you have what\nit takes for you and your mates\nto jump together from a perfectly\ngood aircraft two and a half miles\nhigh, grinning at each other as\nyou perform acrobatics and try to\noutdo each other at a vertical speed\nof 140mph? When you factor in the\nsun beating down on your neck as you\ncome in to land you\u2019ll realise that this is\nnot just a sport, it\u2019s the only sport.\nFor more information visit our\nwebsite http://www.union.\nic.ac.uk/rcc/parachute or\nemail us at parachute@im-perial.ac.uk. IC Parasoc runs\nfrequent weekend trips to our\nhome drop zone, RAF Weston\non the Green, as well as Europe\nand America. Contact us for\nmore details.\n\u201c\u2018But I\u2019m scared\n\u2018But I\u2019m scared\nof heights!\u2019 This\nof heights!\u2019 This\nis unlikely to be\nis unlikely to be\na problem.\u201d\na problem.\u201d\nDesigned by Vitali Lazurenko\n\n"

Those of\nyou who voted in last year\u2019s\nUnion elections \u2013 yes, all\ntwelve of you \u2013 I understand\nthat you thought voting \u2018Felix for Felix\nEditor\u2019 was funny. I get it, there was a\nfunny man on the posters and every-thing. It\u2019s hilarious, after all, when you\ndo something silly in a serious situa-tion. It\u2019s like farting whilst giving evidence at The Hague, or wearing a spinning bow tie when you go to speak at\nyour grandfather\u2019s funeral.\nHowever, real democracy \u2013 yes, the\nkind that actually affects things \u2013 is\nsubtly different to the Union elections,\nand so before I hear one more person\ntell me they\u2019re going to vote for Boris\n\u2018Gosh, Golly and Bilge\u2019 Johnson in the\nmayoral elections \u201cfor a laugh\u201d, let me\nrun through a few of the finer points.\nFirst of all, unlike the Union elec-tions, I can\u2019t avoid the fallout if you get\nyour way. That means that if you dick\nthings up this time \u201cfor a laugh\u201d, I can\u2019t\njust stop eating in the JCR for twelve\nmonths and wait for them to bring\nback wholemeal rolls again. It\u2019s an entire city, guys, and the only reason you\nknow Boris\u2019 name is because, in order\nof importance, he has silly hair, he was\non an episode of Have I Got News For\nYou, and he shagged someone he wasn\u2019t\nsupposed to. Now, whilst I accept that\nthose three attributes cover 70% of\nKensington and Chelsea\u2019s inhabitants,\nthat\u2019s not exactly how choosing a political candidate is supposed to work.\nAnd I know, I know, the papers call\nthe other guy \u201cRed Ken\u201d and say bad\nthings, and the papers are always right\nbecause the other day they told you to\nbuy a man\u2019s trenchcoat from Marks\nAnd Spencer and then that cute guy\nsmiled at you in Starbucks. I get it.\nThing is, though, they\u2019re occasionally\nwrong about stuff, and even if you dislike Ken \u201cFace Like A Cabbage That\u2019s\nBeen Through At Least One, If Not\nTwo, Digestive Systems\u201d Livingstone,\nit doesn\u2019t really follow that you should\nvote in some nincompoop as some\nkind of spiteful backstab.\nI have a friend who, on regular occa-sions, tells me that this country is great\nbecause of its proud history of Democracy. Not real Democracy, obviously,\nthe fake kind where people ask your\nopinion and then spend four years\nsubtly getting you to look the other\nway by pointing and shouting \u201cTaxes!\u201d\nbut Democracy nonetheless. Needless\nto say, she hasn\u2019t been in this country\nfor an election, because if she had she\u2019d\nrealise just how much of a joke it\u2019s become since we were lopping heads off\nof Kings and the like.\nPresumably the desire to joke-vote\nyour way into oblivion comes from the\nA quick thought on life\nS\no, life. What is all about?\nWe all go through phases\nin which one feels like one\nis on the top of the world.\nThis can be taken literally or\nmetaphorically.\nOn the flip side, you do also get times\nwhen things just don\u2019t go as planned or\nthings just fall apart. It is weird though,\nbecause as with most things in life, you\neither make it or you don\u2019t. It is as simple as that.\nA lot of the time, you don\u2019t realise\nsomething is important until it is gone.\nWe take so many things for granted\nwithout realising that we would never\nbe able to get by without these ubiquitous gems in life. Things like family,\nSusan Yu\nfriends and good health. Without these\ntreasures, I reckon, life would be considerably drab and colourless.\nDeath on the other hand is a totally\ndifferent story. Experiencing something as profound as death ultimately\nbrings a different perspective on life\nin general. Fragile and temporary as\na snowflake some might think. To\nsee a loved one go it is undoubtedly\ndevastating.\nIt\u2019s funny you begin to notice things\nlike this do happen as you metamor-phosize and grow into a fully-fledged\nadult. Life is never simple. Always\nwith so many twists and turns, never a\nstraight path. Damn.\nPersonally, I take life as it is. I just\ngo with the flow. Who knows what is\naround the corner, heh? \u2018To be or not\nto be\u2019 is the question that we ask ourselves every single day. Life entails so\nmuch, whether we like it or not. Love,\nfriendship, grief, euphoria and the\nrest.\nTo some people, one\u2019s existence is the\nsole purpose of living unlike most people who endeavour to get the best out\nof what is on offer. Why are we here is\na question that all of us have asked ourselves one time or another I\u2019m sure. To\nsome, God is the ultimate answer. He\nis the Creator and we are only here because of Him and Him alone.\nOthers would think otherwise. We\nare here all due to chance. Evolution\nand Darwin seem to come into the\nequation if you think along these lines.\nBiologists would have some ideas about\nthis. Are we here to make a difference\nto the world or are we alive simply for\nthe sake of being alive? Who knows?\nWell, I reckon that we are here for\na purpose and that is to live life to the\nfull in whatever fashion we think is\nbest. Yeah, rock and roll till sunrise!\nWith this in mind, nihilism is definitely\nnot the way forward.\nBeing a fresher at university is definitely a totally different phase in life,\nthe pinnacle \u2013 meeting new people,\ngetting used to a new environment and\nestablishing a new way of living. Can\u2019t\nwait for what life has in store for us!\nA. Geek\nnotion that your vote doesn\u2019t actually\ncount, as if the auditors at the Polling\nBooth look at each card and just say,\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s voted for Boris, but this\nguy\u2019s a kidder. Put it in the incinerator,\nGeoff.\u201d\nThe idea that one voter is insignificant was fine when it made you stay\nat home and not give a toss \u2013 that was\nbliss, it meant that those of us that did\nvote could just tell you to where to\nshove it when you complained about\nthe government six months later. Now\nyou\u2019ve decided to be post-modern and\nindividual by voting for someone you\nfind amusing, without realising that\neveryone else is going to do the same\nthing. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 people are\njust as cripplingly lazy in real elections\nas they were in the Union ones \u2013 but\nthere\u2019s nothing the general public likes\nmore than doing pitifully ridiculous\nthings en masse. See also: war, religion,\nbuying throw rugs for sofas and Diet\nCoke.\nNow, at this point you may be think-ing, \u201cBut if everyone votes for Boris,\nthat\u2019s democracy, right? Whatever we\nwanted him for, at least we chose him.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s fine, if you\u2019re an idealist\nwho thinks that Greece had it right all\nalong.\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t live in a\nfuturistic utopia where people take\ndrugs to purify their minds and make\nclear-cut decisions about which colour to paint the living room. We live\nin a world where people take normal\ndrugs, paint the living room disgusting\nvariations on the same shade of beige,\nand vote for whoever they\u2019re told to.\nSo don\u2019t try and tell me that the people get what they wish. The people get\nwhat they\u2019re told to wish for. And on\nthat note, I\u2019d ask you \u2013 be careful what\nyou wish for. You might get it.\n\u201c\nI can\u2019t just\nstop eating in the\nJCR for twelve\nmonths waiting\nfor wholemeal\nrolls to return\n\u201d\nA good madman is hard to find\nI\nthink that any self-respect-ing university should have\nits own campus madman. Or\nmadwoman.\nBy \u2018mad\u2019, I don\u2019t just mean\nthe scruffiness of absentminded pro-fessors, or the hairstyles and fashion\nsense (stretching those two terms to\ntheir respective breaking points) of bewildered undergraduates. I don\u2019t even\nmean those poor souls studying medi-cine, though what better definition of\ninsanity exists I know not.\nNo, I mean mad in the strictest sense\nof the term \u2013 a good, old-fashioned\ngibbering, odoriferous, potato-wear-ing outcast, with an endearingly nicknamed carrot dangling from a leash in\ntheir hand. The last of these is optional,\nthough all the best continental lunatics\nseem to be carrying them this season.\nPersonally, I find that a university\ncrackpot is just as valuable a figure as\na lecturer; more so, even, as no one\nlecturer can claim to be known to the\nentire student body, whereas campus\nloons the world over are familiar faces\nto millions.\nThese individuals, as bothersome\nas they can be on occasions, play a vital role in ensuring student cohesion.\nTheir antics provide daily amusement,\nand their presence an excuse to put\na premature end to uncomfortable\nconversations. Some of you may be\nrunning away with the idea that I am\nreferring to actual psychopaths \u2013 dangerous knife-wielding giants for whom\nasylums (and showers) were invented. I\nask for no such extravagance. A simple,\ncarefree, pamphlet-distributing fanatic\nis all I desire. And look at what we have\nto offer in exchange for an hour or two\nof entertaining buffoonery every day;\na guaranteed audience, a fantastic address in the heart of London, institutional tenure \u2013 what more could any\nsimple, ordinary maniac ask for?\nNow, I know that not every university\nhas the time or the inclination to scour\nthe neighbouring regions for a person\nworthy of the position. But surely, in\nthe centre of a city such as London,\ncreeps, weirdoes, stalkers and engaging hoboes can\u2019t be too hard to find?\nBeing new to Imperial College, I do\nnot know what to expect on the mad-person front. Having heard only good\nthings about this institution, however,\nI do not doubt that the crucial position\nhas been filled, and, surely, by a person\nof some international standing. If not,\nthen I am convinced that such a prestigious university must make up for the\nlack of this one individual eccentric\nwith a general atmosphere of insanity.\nI feel it will be a fun and intersting four\nyears.\nGilead Amit\nBoris Johnson: Voting is no joke\n\n"

Period. That is why the average\nJoe is just that\u2026 average. But ask your-self, would you settle for an average\ncar; an average house; an average job?\nI\u2019m not saying you have to overhaul\nyour life to achieve this, and to be fair a\nbodybuilder\u2019s working day is hard to fit\nin a student\u2019s 24 hrs, but if you\u2019re going\nto do something you might as well try\nand do it right.\nSleep, believe it or not, is an integral\npart of muscle building. As you sleep,\nyour body releases hormones and\ngrowth factors during the night which\naidmusclegrowthandrecovery.There-fore, 8 is the requisite number of hours\nof sleep for good muscle building.\nNutrition is supremely important;\nafter all, your muscle has to come\nfrom somewhere. First of all, meals\u2026\nyou need about five of them a day. Not\nfive three-courses but five small meals.\nThis gives your body a constant source\nof energy and keeps your hormones\nin check. Breakfast is a must. Wholesome, full of protein and slow releasing\ncarbs, without it you will go fat. This\nmeans oats, eggs, low fat cheese and\nwholemeal bread get the thumbs up.\nLast night\u2019s pizza is a hell no!! Lunch\nshould consist of lean meat, pasta\nand salad. In between, fruit and semi\nskimmed milk should do the trick.\nPrior to your workout you may require a boost\u2026 red bull (sugarfree) and\nhalf a protein shake will turn an OK\nworkout into a mind blowing, plateau\ncrushing experience. Sports drinks are\na no-no as the sugar high will lead to\nan inevitable crash halfway during\nyour workout. Just keep to water during your workout and lots of it.\nHowever the real gains come in\nthe post-workout, when muscles are\nprimed for growth\u2026 I like the post-workout meal given last week but spare\nno expense if you strive for perfection\n\u2013 protein shakes are a must, and dinner should be meaty and veggie!\nThe oak chest, when perfected it is\nthe statement of manliness. Look at\nyour typical rugby player and you\u2019ll\nsee a proud chest puffed out showing\nyou he is something. Everyone knows\nperculating pecs drive the ladies wild,\nand I know you want to get that too.\nSo stick to the following base chest\nprogram and turn the pigeon chest\ninto something you can puff out and\nbe proud. Remember: select weights\nwhich are heavy enough so that you\nreach muscular failure at the desired\nrep number.\nA finisher is an aspect of training\nthat most people overlook; a final push\nto achieve maximal results from your\nwork out. A chance to put your tired,\nbatteredbodythroughonemoreround.\nA tri-set is the combination of three exercises completed in quick succession\nand counts as one set. A tri-set combination is completed three times; hence\nthree sets, and each time you change\nthe order of the exercise. Hence, using\nthe final exercises, the first set should\nbe 1,2,3; the second 2,3,1 and the final\n3,1,2. Follow me? This way you achieve\nan equal work out and finish with a\nchiselled chest that separates the men\nfrom young pretenders.\nLadies, ladies, ladies.

Got a talent\nsuch as moonwalking\nwhilst flying a magic\ncarpet around the Sun?\nEmail your wisdom to\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk and\ntell other people How To...\nLearnt something the hard\nway and want to prevent it\nfrom happening to others?\nEmail felix@imperial.\nac.uk and warn people\nHow Not To...\nF\nelix\u2019s duty to the people is to\ninform and entertain. This\nweek we are going beyond\nthe call of duty to bring you\nan invaluable guide that will\nhelp you garner the greatest enjoyment\npossible from all those hedonistic parties that you\u2019ll be attending throughout\nthe year. Not only that though, Felix is\ngiving the following sound advice so\nthat you know what not to do and say\nat a party, and also to prevent yourself\nfrom being a complete mongfart. We\u2019re\nentirely qualified to say so.\nStep 1: Share your alcohol\nDon\u2019t get precious about those bottles of shandy you\u2019ve got stashed in\nthe rucksack on your back. Take your\nbackpack off, unzip it and crack open\nthe brewskis. Spread the wealth you\ntight bastard.\nStep 2: Don\u2019t comment on the\nmusic that\u2019s playing\nLook, no one cares whether you think\nthe music is shit. Likewise, no one\ncares if you believe this tune is totally\nslamming. All you end up doing when\nyou start talking about music at a party\nis get into an argument or a fight. Just\nget funkeh to those cheesy choons and\nyou\u2019ll be having a whale of a time.\nStep 3: Don\u2019t affect a stammer to\nlook intellectual\nW-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-well, the... reason\none shouldn\u2019t t-t-t-talk with a stammer is because one comes-across-as-an-uppity-arse. Just because you can\npause for breath in between six syllable\nwords, it doesn\u2019t make you some kind\nof divine student that others should\nstand and be in awe of. Get over your-self, sip on some bud and take it easy.\nStep 4: Don\u2019t talk about your\nlectures or your course\nThis really is the oldest one in the\nbook. You\u2019ve just finished three hours\nworth of learning about the different\nnames of the bones in your leg (tibia,\nfibia, kneecap, bronchitis, albumen \u2013\nscore! 5 out of 5) and some over eager\nbeaver is still questioning whether the\ncontent of the lecture was pitched well\nenough. Who cares? Seriously. Well,\nnow you\u2019ve gone there, if you think the\nlecture was that bad, why don\u2019t you try\ntaking it yourself? Heck.\nEnough already. Just don\u2019t talk\nshop and everyone will get along just\ngreat. The exception to the rule is a\nVvvvvvvedensky lecture, of course.\nStep 5: Don\u2019t be a non-drinking,\nteetotal moron\nYou\u2019re not better than anyone else by\nnot drinking, you know? Wow, you\u2019re\ntaking a stand against the mainstream\nby not consuming alcohol \u2013 aren\u2019t you\nmaking mummy and daddy proud? If\nyou want, we\u2019ll get you started on some\nHooch, after all that watch me go off\nmy trolley for the very first time. We\u2019ll\nmove on to the harder hitting stuff\n(SoCo&L anyone?) gradually and we\u2019ll\nhave you attending sports night in the\nUnion in no time at all.\nStep 6: If you insist on being\nteetotal, don\u2019t bang on about it\nSo you\u2019re as stubborn as the day is long.\nStop wishing for other people to join in\non your misery. If you\u2019re not going to\nlive life to the max and consume, don\u2019t\nbrain wash everyone else with your\nway-out-there views.\nStep 7: Don\u2019t harp on about your\nbloody A-levels\nHow long ago did you take those ex-ams? No one cares for starts and no\none wants to know. If you insist on\ncomparing yourself to everyone else\nat the party, ask them about shoe size\nor something like that. You know what\nthey say, big feet, big...\nStep 8: Drink some more!\nFast flowing, delicious and golden. Get\nit down your neck and the world will\nbecome your own hazy oyster.\nStep 9: Don\u2019t focus all your energy on one lady\nUnless you\u2019re a player or a billy-no-mates, you probably attend parties\nwith a group of your mates. Mates being the keyword here. If you spot a sexy\nchica/chap from afar, don\u2019t spend the\nrest of the evening gawping at him/her\nlike some lecherous vulture about to\nswoop onto your prey. Mosey on over,\nintroduce her to your friends and get\neveryone involved. She\u2019ll realise you\u2019re\nnot a loner and you\u2019ll be better off for\nit.\nStep 10: Hellamashup\nNeed I say more.\nPlease drink responsibly\n1. Get yourself a padlock and keep your door locked!\n2. Wash your hands directly afterwards\n3. Make sure you\u2019re not sweaty and flustered\n\n"

An assortment of life-like\nfigures of the Chinese people, ranging\nfrom soldiers and cavalry to acrobats\nand administrators were buried with\nChina\u2019s First Emperor Qin Shihuangdi,\nalong with other items that would allow him to continue his life in the same\nfashion after his death.\nPrior to the founding of China, the\narea was comprised of 7 separate states,\nand was not unified until 221BC. The\nstate of Qin, the most powerful, conquered the others to form Qin, which\nwas the foundation of China as we\nknow it today. The King of Qin changed\nhis title to the \u2018First August and Divine\nEmperor\u2019, to separate himself from the\nprevious Kings and Dukes that had\nruled the individual states and then\ntook upon the task of transforming the\ncountry into an advanced nation that\nwas superior to any other.\nThroughout his rule, Qin Shihangdi\naccomplished many feats, some of\nwhich are still present in some form to-day. The First Great Wall was built preceding the Great Wall of China, which\nwas completed in the Ming Dynasty of\n1368-1644. Furthermore, some of the\nconcepts employed in society and industry today initiated in Qin. Qin was\none of the first country\u2019s to introduce\nquality control; all tools and swords\nhad the initials of the workers and\nsupervisory craftsmen embossed on\nthem so that quality could be traced.\nThey also introduced the idea of using standardised weights and meas-ures. Due to the number of men that\nthe country had access to through\nconscription, mass-production was\nable to be utilised to produce weap-onry, ornaments and the Terracotta\nArmy; however the often inhumane\nmethods to reach such advancements\nare often criticised. The uncovering of\nthe tombs made evident the extensive\nadministrative procedures that were\nused and evidently necessary, due to\nthe vast area of land that was being\ncovered. All the Qin Laws were found\nto be inscribed on 1100 bamboo strips\nof a local magistrate.\nOne particularly interesting aspect\nof Qin Shihangdi is his fear of death.\nThree attempts to kill him were made,\nand as death did not fit in with his ambitions for Qin, he made numerous\nefforts to prolong his life. The First\nWhat makes it even more stimulating\nis that the central tomb which houses\nEmperor Qin Shihangdi is yet to be\nexcavated. New methods of retrieving\nthe contents without actually opening\nit are being explored. However, if speculation proves true, there may be rivers of mercury mimicking China\u2019s rivers and pearls mapping out the stars in\nthe night sky within the central tomb.\nConsidering the impressive items that\nhave been found until now, including\nthe 7000 terracotta soldiers, which are\neach individually made and slightly dif-ferent, who knows what could be un-covered. \u2018The First Emperor \u2013 China\u2019s\nTerracotta Army\u2019 is being exhibited at\nthe British Museum until April 2008;\ndon\u2019t miss out on the opportunity to\nexplore one of the most advanced and\nunusual ancient civilisations.\nThe Terracotta Army will remain\noccupied in British Museum\nterritory until the 6th April 2008.\nTickets can be booked online...\nDon\u2019t just turn up or you will be\nqueuing for hours.\nEmperor would drink and eat from\ngold and jade, believing that due to\ntheir resistance to corrosion, his own\nlife would be extended. Furthermore\nhe took a mixture of pills and potions.\nBy developing a detailed replica of Qin\nunderground and constructing a palace for his afterlife, which was protected by the Terracotta Army, he believed\nthat he would be able to carry on with\nhis ambitious plans into the afterlife.\nThis exhibition provides an exciting\nand informative insight into an ancient society that many are unaware of.\nThis 2000 year old archer was just mid-way through the Ancient Qin hacca before he was \u2018terracota-ed\u2019\nHe really could administrate your ass off, this here Civil Official\n\n"

It puts on exclusively new writing\ntheatre, i.e. all the productions come from new theatre writers, it maybe their first\nplay or whose work is realised for the first time at the Bush. The theatre nurtures the\nwork of writers from all backgrounds who write passionate and witty contemporary\ntales.\nOnly 34 years old, it is another easy one to miss being dwarfed by a large O\u2019Neills on\none side and Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire on the other. The Bush is a very friendly theatre\nand one begins to recognise faces on subsequent visits. The Artistic Director a very\nsweet and welcoming woman. The Bush, although small and seemingly inconsequen-tial, continues to attract talent such as Bob Hoskins and Kate Beckinsale. Last February, on a mission for this dear paper, I attended an extremely witty yet poignant play\n\u2018I Like Mine With A Kiss\u2019 (\u201cmine\u201d being the woman\u2019s eggs, but I had to wait until the\nclosing scene to find that out!) I am always impressed with the acting talent in many\nof the smaller theatre companies and the Bush is no exception.\nComing soon \u2013 \u2018How To Curse\u2019, a modern take on Shakespeare\u2019s \u2018The Tempest\u2019,\nset in Great Yarmouth about young people. Also, \u2018The Dysfunckshonalz\u2019, it\u2019s spelling\nreflective of the play\u2019s tale of punk, spilt blood, corporate sell-outs and a fellow named\nBilly Abortion. The theatre offers deals for the more financially disorganised or tightfisted among us, such as four shows for fifty pounds. See website for more offers.\nwww.bushtheatre.co.uk\nA West End Selection Box\nTrying to fit all the major West End theatres onto this culture crawl would be a bit tricky in terms\nof trying to fit over 30 theatres onto two tube stops! So, I have chosen three which are showing\nsome must-sees. Of course once one has come out of either tube station, one can\u2019t see for huge\nbillboards adorning the front of the theatres- any theatre guide or map can hereby be discarded!\nHer Majesty\u2019s Theatre in Haymarket is currently home to Lloyd Webber\u2019s classic musical \u2018The\nPhantom of the Opera\u2019. If you are one with limited knowledge of musicals, let alone proper plays,\nthen this is the one to see before you go anywhere near stage productions of \u2018West Side Story\u2019 or\n\u2018Grease\u2019. A tragic love story, brilliant music and guaranteed to move you. The theatre, undergoing\na few name changes along the way, is just over 300 years old and is seconds away from equally\nbountiful establishment TigerTiger (pfft). I jest; the club is a lot of fun and just as culturally void\nas a club should be.\nHop across a couple of streets to Shaftesbury Avenue and we arrive at the Palace Theatre where\nthe hilarious \u2018Spamalot\u2019 is showing at the moment. Another musical, but a far cry off the gravity\nof The Phantom, this production is brimming with all the Monty Python humour we all know and\nlove. Based on \u2018The Holy Grail\u2019, it has been deemed \u201cfunnier than the Black Death\u201d by one U.S.\nmagazine.\nNamed after the notable English playwright, the Noel Coward Theatre in St Martin\u2019s Lane gives\nus Avenue Q, the muppet musical. Exceedingly, gloriously politically incorrect, no one is spared in\nthis comedy. Set in one of New York\u2019s less glamorous avenues, the play incorporates adult themes,\nstrong language and sexual situations as conceptualised by puppets- hurrah! No under 4s please.\nwww.hermajestys.co.uk\nwww.palace-theatre-london.com\nwww.noel-coward-theatre.com\nThe Donmar Warehouse, Covent Garden\nThe Donmar is another gem. Just a minute\u2019s walk from Covent Garden tube station, it is rather easy to miss being nestled\nbetween the trendy boutiques and bars of the beautifully cobbled Earlham Street. Conveniently opposite Belgo\u2019s Central- a\nbustling Belgian eatery serving a myriad of beers and other poisons and fantastic chips from my cultural heritage; a perfect\nplace to discuss the virtues (or lack thereof) of the Donmar\u2019s latest offering.\nThe Donmar seats just over 200 so there is a very intimate, but by no means claustrophobic, feel to any show you see there.\nThe Warehouse puts on new writing as well as contemporary reappraisals of classics, drama and a few musicals. One musical showing at the moment is \u2018Parade\u2019 (also reviewed in the previous edition of Felix, by yours truly). It was a credit to the\nproduction that even my musical-suspicious self liked it.\nUpcoming productions that should not be missed include Shakespearean classic \u2018Othello\u2019 featuring Ewan McGregor as\nIago and also Arthur Miller\u2019s \u2018The Man Who Had All The Luck\u2019. If you have never heard of any of these names then get\nyourself to a theatre as soon as possible and be enlightened, entertained and impressed.\nwww.donmarwarehouse.com\nChapter Three \u2013 Theatres\n\n"

Felix\nloses crown\nImperial College website revamped and ready to relaunch in December\nCollege is in the process of having a\nnew website designed to replace the\nexisting one at www.imperial.ac.uk.\nThe redesigned website will be launching on 10th December.\nCollege has commissioned web design company New City Media to build\nthe website. The project has been running since February 2007 and the build\nis far along enough for students to view\nTom Roberts preview pictures of what the website\nwill look like when it eventually goes\nlive. To have a look for yourself and\neven leave comments about the web-site, head to https://www7.imperial.\nac.uk/commsblog/blogsThere you\u2019ll\nfind the Web Redesign blog which\nis kept up-to-date with the latest\ndevelopments.\nThe aim of the web redesign project\nis \u201cto modernise the visual design and\nmake it easier for users to quickly find\nrelevant information\u201d, something that\nthe imperial.ac.uk has been crying out\nfor for ages.\nWith the current design, something\nas important as finding your exam results can turn into a struggle for even\nthe most on-the-ball web users.\nTyping \u201cexam results\u201d into the existing search engine throws up over\ntwenty thousand results, the first ten\nof which don\u2019t link to the Student Self\nService where results are viewed on-line. Strangely enough, the first result\ngenerated happens to be \u201cStudent Appeals\u201d; perhaps College is trying to\nsuggest something.\nUnless users have a direct link to a\npart of the existing website, it is very\ndifficult to navigate meaning that\nlarge areas of imperial.ac.uk remain\ninaccessible.\nHopefully the redesigned website can\naddress these issues and students won\u2019t\nhave to spend precious minutes surfing\nthe web in circles.\nThe Imperial website\u2019s current design\nDoes the Imperial website\u2019s new look inspire you?\nNominated: Last year\u2019s Felix\nTravel writer Peter Dominiczak\nOn Monday, the nominations for the\n2007 Guardian Student Media Awards\nwere announced.\nAt last year\u2019s awards ceremony Felix\nwas awarded Student Newspaper of the\nYear and the editor at the time, Rupert\nNeate, also walked away with Student\nJournalist of the Year.\nHowever, this year Felix has only\nbeen nominated for one award. Peter\nDominiczak has been nominated as\nStudent Travel Writer of the Year. Mr\nDominiczak\u2019s articles documented his\nunconventional trips to places such as\nLithuania and even Somerset where he\nmet a man simply known as Big Iain\nand together the pair set about frolicking in the countryside.\nImperial\u2019s student news website Live!\n(live.cgcu.net) was also nominated for\nStudent Website of the Year. The nomination comes after a year in which the\nLive! editor Ashley Brown was threatened with lawsuits for some of the\nwebsite\u2019s content.\nThe 2007 Guardian Student Media Awards ceremony takes place on\nWednesday 21st November.\nReceiving mixed messages\nAccessibility, fees and fairness: opinions clash over future of the UK\u2019s higher education\nThis week has seen yet another resurgence of debate over the controversial\ndirection of Higher Education in the\nUK. But students, and potential stu-dents, have been left with a distinctly\nmixed message, some points of which\nleave a sour taste in the mouth.\nA series of government policy statements and ministerial comments followed the predictably regular story\nabout Oxbridge: this time centred on\nthe publishing of statistics showing\nthat one third of Oxbridge\u2019s student\nintake comes from only 100 schools,\nthe vast majority of which are private.\nThese announcements were intended\nto re-iterate the government\u2019s policy of\nuniversity education for those who are\nable, regardless of their background.\nThis culminated in Wednesday\u2019s\nlaunch of a blueprint for Universities to\nforge \u201cpartnerships\u201d with a local acad-emy, with Cabinet MP John Denham\nurging universities to adopt one of the\ngovernment\u2019s new, partially privately\nfunded, secondary schools. Several\nuniversities, including Imperial College and UCL, have expressed interest\nin the scheme, which is designed to\nform \u201cdeep-rooted\u201d links between top\nuniversities and local schools. Several\nother Universities have been unmoved\nby Denham\u2019s encouragement, preferring their own methods for attracting\nstate-sector students.\nMeanwhile, in this week\u2019s Sunday\nTelegraph, the Rector, Sir Richard\nSykes, criticised \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d de-grees, whilst advocating not only an\nincrease in top-up fees, but an increase\nin the interest rates that students pay\non their loans.\n\u201cThe system has to change,\u201d said the\nRector, who, pulling in \u00a3305k a year,\nhas the second highest salary of all UK\nUniversity heads. \u201cIt will then make\npeople think twice before they go off\nand do damn silly courses that are no\ngood to them and won\u2019t get them a\ngood job at the end of the day. It would\nmean university is not just a nice four\nyears off.\u201d\nSir Richard has a history of being\noutspoken in his support of increasing the cost of higher education to the\nstudent. On Sunday he advocated an\nincrease of the top-up fees from \u00a33000\nto \u00a35000 after the review in 2009.\nAn increase in the interest paid on\nstudent loans (effective immediately\nafter graduation) would see a dramatic\nincrease in the cost, to the student, of a\nUniversity education. Debt is already a\nmajor concern for students in general,\nwith loan repayments continuing many\nyears after graduation, even for a degree alone. For Masters and PhD stu-dents, calculation of exactly how much\ndebt they can afford often dictates\nthe path of their career. With such an\nincrease in the student loan rate, suggested at a level just under bank rates,\nwe could see students paying off their\ndebt well into middle age.\nThese two conflicting points of view,\ncoming respectively from the Cabinet\nMinister for higher education, and one\nof the most influential university heads\nin the country, show the incongruity\nbetween the attitudes of educational\nchiefs and government policy. A conflict which appears to be leading neither in the right direction.\nPrevalent student opinion shows a\ngeneral detachment from both sides.\nThe government obsession with the\nmagically arbitrary figure of 50% of\npupils going on to University seems to\ncare little about the quality and value\nof the courses involved, and students\nfeel their degrees become devalued in\ngeneral.\nWhereas the Rector\u2019s abrasive comments exhibit the kind of arrogance\nwhich the top universities in the country are attempting to purge from their\nreputations. Whilst many sympathise\nwith his dislike of gratuitous degree\ncourses (such as David Beckham stud-ies), there is a distinctly sour taste left\nin their mouths over his apparent view\nof degree courses as nothing but a business plan for maximum profit. Many\nare concerned by his lack of obvious\nacademic sentiment: the concept that\nthe advancement of humanity is a valuable and noble pursuit in itself, without\nthe endless pursuit of economic profit.\nThus he cements the image of Imperial\nCollege Plc., a place of business, not of\nlearning.\nThe effect of these views on education in general is as yet unknown, but\nsome fear that the future holds a wor-ryingly Americanised system. A system\nwhere it is impossible to progress in any\ncareer without a degree, but attending\nuniversity is massively expensive. This\nkind of system penalises the poorer\nstudents more than any other, exactly\nthe effect that the aforementioned\nmeasures are designed to avoid.\nWhilst such debate rages on about\nthe future of higher education in the\nUK, the student body is undecided\nabout what it wants: we at Imperial like\nbeing the elite, but dislike being treated\nas a business case and milked dry of\nour income for years to come.\nThe Union voted on Monday to revoke our current policy on tuition fees\n(current policy being that the Union is\nopposed to any increase in the amount\nthat students are charged for educa-tion), pending an investigation into\nour true opinion on the matter. Until\nthe students body decides what it really wants from its education, it remains\nhelpless over how much it is prepared\nto pay for it.\nOne obvious question is posed, how-ever: is anyone sure of what they want\neducation to actually achieve. Even the\ngovernment seems to have difficulty in\nmaking up its mind.\nAndrew Somerville\nNews Editor\nIntense revision for the new Nursery Rhymes A-Level\n\n"

If you\ncan\u2019t smell it, then your\nnose is probably red, sore\nand runny already. That\nmeans pretty much one thing: winter\nhas cometh.\nNormally, this heralds the most derided of times. Who would want to\nleave the warm, snug sanctity of their\nbeds in order to trudge through sharp,\nicy winds that bite at your face with\nmalice? Wouldn\u2019t you rather bask in the\nreassuring glow of your TV or monitor\nwhile partaking in an intense shoot-out. With a mug of hot chocolate getting colder on your desk, of course.\nSee, winter is really a glorious time\nof the year for any gamer worth their\nmemory card. The slow summer season transitions into an autumn that\u2019s\nusually marked by a few peerless games\n\u2013 in this case, we\u2019ve been blessed by\nthe one-two knockout combination of\nBioShock and Halo 3 \u2013 a near-ultimate\nculmination of brains and brawn in\npretty much one go. And that Metroid\nPrime 3 didn\u2019t go unscathed by praise.\nBut don\u2019t start looking forward to the\npiddling interest rates offered by NatWest; you\u2019ll need to keep that cashcard\nwarm and working. This is the time of\nyear when developers pat themselves\non the back and let years of hard work,\nbroken whips and fair treatment violations come to fruition. Throughout\nthe next few months we\u2019ll be treated\nto a deluge of awesome videogames\nthat will redefine the industry as we\u2019ve\nknown it, or at least make us grin with\nunrestrained glee.\nThis week, Sebb explodes with excitement as the PC receives a dose\nof unadulterated joy with the likes of\nthe impossibly gorgeous Crysis, the\ncomically genius Team Fortress 2 and\nmore. I\u2019m not normally a PC gamer,\nbut I have to say that Team Fortress\n2 really appeals to the side of me that\nadores artistic titles like Shadow of the\nColossus or Psychonauts. Amazingly,\nthe game comes lovingly bundled\nwith some rather fantastic titles that\nare worthy enough on their own. The\nprice? Well, you\u2019ll have to read the article to find out!\nFelix Games also shows other sections that not all the stuff we write is\nmade up during moments of pure de-lirium: we do that reporting thingama-jiggy as well. This time around, you\u2019ll\nfind out how the British Championship Gaming Series Final went down\nat Bromley. It\u2019s interesting to observe\nhow a gargantuan mainstream media\noutlet like SkyOne interpret a passionate pastime. There\u2019s obviously some\nsmoke and mirrors involved, but we\u2019ve\nprodded enough to see that there\u2019s definitely potential in a concept that has\nsteadily been gaining popularity on the\nother sides of the pond. We iz jurnal-istz, after all.\nOur commitment to the Indie gaming scene is as strong as ever as we\ncheck out yet another addicting gem \u2013\nthe rather humorously named Bloxorz.\nHope to see you start writing for Felix\nas well!\nThis\nWeek\nQ4 \u201807: A PC gaming story\nSebastian Nordgren is here to remind you that the fight\u2019s hardly finished\nI\nt\u2019s that wonderful time of the\nyear when student loans have\njust come through and are sitting in your bank account,\nmocking you with their exist-ence, and the games industry thinks it\u2019s\nfair to release three-quarters of the tri-ple-A titles in the same month. While\nwe at Felix fully believe in financial\nresponsibility, we also know that we\u2019ll\nbe surviving on beans on toast for the\nnext couple of months after the gaming\nfeast being served up in what is known\nas the pre-holiday season, or simply as\nQ4 2007.\nWhile Valve\u2019s always been known\nfor being rather generous with their\nofferings, packaging Counter-Strike\nSource with Half-Life 2 and bundling\nDay of Defeat Source with the game of\nthe year edition \u2013 The Orange Box is\njust a bit ridiculous. Included are (deep\nbreath): Half-Life 2, Episode One, Episode Two, Portal and Team Fortress 2.\nIf you\u2019re of the type that reads reviews,\nyou\u2019ll know that that\u2019s a combined total of around 470% of amazing gaming.\nAnd, for what you\u2019re getting, it\u2019s a bargain as well, costing only US$40 (about\n\u00a320 \u2013 Az Ed.). No questions, just buy\nit \u2013 even more so if you haven\u2019t already\nplayed HL2 or Episode One.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen a trailer of Crysis,\ndo that first and come back after. Go\non. Done? You didn\u2019t do it, did you?\nNo, didn\u2019t think so. Then you\u2019ll just\nhave to take our word for it \u2013 Crysis is\nso beautiful that it makes real life look\nlike it could use a few more pixel shad-ers. Rumours have it that the name\ncomes from a combination of the first\nreactions people have when they see it\n\u2013 they cry wonderfully-rendered tears\nof joy, and they despair at the impending financial crisis of upgrading their\ncomputer to be able to smoothly run\nthe game at full detail. Our advice for\nyou, dear reader, is not to be foolish\nand buy a new computer to run Crysis,\nbecause it won\u2019t. Also, the game features live (and hence killable) chickens.\nOur prediction is that it will replace\n\u2018cs_italy\u2019 as the premier chicken-killing\nsimulator available.\nInfinity Ward have firmly established\nthemselves as one of the biggest developers around, and it\u2019s with a sense of\nexcitement that we look forward to the\nmodern warfare version of Call of Duty.\nIt\u2019s looking like a Battlefield-killer in\nmultiplayer, with impeccable balance\nand perks that allow you to do all sorts\nof cool stuff, but as always with Call of\nDuty \u2013 the single-player is where we\u2019ll\nbe. Call of Duty does war better than\nanyone else, and it\u2019s a safe bet that this\nwill be the closest you\u2019ll get to Iraq\nwithout wearing camouflage.\nWith all the other games being\nshooters, it\u2019s good to get a bit of variation with a (wait for it) shooter RPG.\nHellgate: London is set in our beloved\ncity after it\u2019s been invaded by the forces\nof Hell, creating a festering pit of evil,\ncarnage and other bad stuff (so not all\nthat different, then). Created by the\nteam that made Diablo 2 the addictive force it is, Hellgate looks to single-handedly resurrect the online randomly generated dungeon crawl genre.\nGood money is on the titular hellgate\nbeing located in South Kensington,\nbetween the Natural History Museum\nand Royal Albert Hall.\nAnd another non-shooter, would\nyou believe it? World in Conflict is an\noriginal take on the RTS genre, doing away with everything that doesn\u2019t\ninvolve blowing stuff up. No resource\nmanagement, no base building and no\nformations. The concept practically\nclamours for the game to be played co-operatively, with each player choosing\na specialization (air, infantry, etc.) and\nthen using regenerating resources to\nbuy units and tactical aids. God, that\nalmost sounds like something an actual magazine might write, so here\u2019s\nthe kicker \u2013 there\u2019s nukes. Big, pretty\nnukes.\nBack to the shooters, then. Unreal\nTournament III is actually the fourth\nUnreal Tournament, but Epic have\nchosen to forget the rather awkward\nUnreal Tournament 2003. This one\ndoes away with some of old gameplay\nmodes and replaces them with WARFARE OR SOMETHING RATHER,\nan amalgamation of Onslaught and\nAssault, with a bit of Bombing Run\nthrown in for good measure. The new\niteration promises bigger, stompier\nrobots, while still retaining the classic deathmatch feeling that made the\noriginal Unreal Tournament a classic.\nFor deathmatch purists, Epic promises\nthat the movement has been made less\nfloaty than Unreal Tournament 2004,\nwith feet planted firmly on the ground\nmost of the time. Don\u2019t worry, dodges\nare still in.\nAmongst a metric assload of great\ngames, it\u2019s easy for games like Enemy\nTerritory: Quake Wars to be over-looked. Although it does borrow some\nthings from its Quake namesake, don\u2019t\nbe deceived. This is more Battlefield 2\nthan Quake 4, creating an interesting\namalgamation of the objective-based\ngameplay of Enemy Territory and vehi-cle-based Battlefield. It\u2019s a game that is\nplayed at a frantic pace, but with none\nof the glitches associated with the Battlefield series. For people who thought\nthat Battlefield 2 was too slow, this is\nthe game you\u2019ve been waiting for.\nAlso, while we\u2019re at it, you DID buy\nBioShock, right? If you haven\u2019t, go buy\nit. I mean, it\u2019s been 2 months, why\nhaven\u2019t you got it yet? So, there you go\n\u2013 even the most skint of you will find\nsomething to spend your hard-earned\n(hah!) student loan money on in the\nupcoming pre-holiday season.\nWords fail to describe how freakin\u2019 awesome Crysis looks\nPC Gaming\u2019s back... and he\u2019s brought some friends\nCGS UK F.I.N.A.L.S.
