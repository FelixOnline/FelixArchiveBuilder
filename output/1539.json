STUDENT V\ntudents \u2013 other than being\nthe drunken, lazy, sel\ufb01sh\ncreatures we\u2019re perceived to\nbe by all those people with\nreal jobs \u2013 are also an amazing resource. We are young, healthy\n(hopefully), intelligent people with a\nmassive capacity to bring about real\nchange.\nNext week is Student Volunteering\nWeek; a national week brought to you\nby NUS and your very own Imperial\nHub aimed at celebrating the enormous contribution that student volunteers make to their communities\nacross the country, and inspiring the\nnext generation of student volunteers.\nI can hear what\u2019s going through your\nhead already \u2013 I don\u2019t have time for\nthis. And I\u2019m not pretending that everyone has limitless free time to spend\nvolunteering. I know that Imperial\u2019s\ntimetable is pretty horrendous. Some\nof us e\ufb00ectively have full time jobs\nwith 9am to 5pm days, as well as social lives, maybe we play sport, there\u2019s\nso much good TV at the moment\u2026\nand we enjoy sleep \u2013 so where does\nvolunteering \ufb01t in? For most of us, it\ndoesn\u2019t. This article will hopefully con-Madeleine Maxwell let\u2019s you know what it\u2019s all about, and why you should care\nvince you that it really, really should.\nFor those of you that have already\npondered this topic, have decided that\nit\u2019s not for you, and are thinking about\n\ufb02ipping straight to the centrefold...\nPlease visit this website: www.sparked.\ncom to \ufb01nd out about micro-volun-teering. Here, 20 minutes or an hour\nof your time can truly make a di\ufb00erence. The \u201cSparked\u201d platform involves\nmatching a \u201crequest\u201d from a charity or\nindividual to a pool of potential \u201csolvers\u201d \u2013 the micro-volunteers.\nFor everyone else, read on to \ufb01nd\nout why I think we should all volun-teer.\nDiscover your passionate side\nSpending the afternoon in an old people\u2019s home listening to a woman with\na beard repeating the story of her\nson\u2019s birth 20 times might be someone\u2019s idea of heaven\u2026 but maybe it\u2019s\nnot yours. When you volunteer, you\nhave to \ufb01nd a cause or organisation\nthat you feel genuinely moved and\nmotivated by. You will be in a much\nbetter position to learn something, to\nmake an actual di\ufb00erence, and have\nan impact on those you\u2019re helping if\nyou\u2019re doing something that you care\nabout.\nIt\u2019s a 2-way street\nVolunteering undoubtedly leaves you\nwith that warm tingly feeling that\ncomes with doing a truly good deed.\nSo, even though the primary aim of\nvolunteering should be to help some-one, or a cause, you ultimately help\nyourself too. Volunteering does and\nshould bene\ufb01t both the cause AND\nthe volunteer \u2013 it\u2019s about doing good\nfor others as well as for yourself. Before you volunteer, think about how\nyou are going to help, and also ask\nyourself \u201cwhat am I going to gain from\nthis experience?\u201d Whether it\u2019s developing skills, meeting people, or just\nthe warm tingly feeling\u2026(mmm)\nNetworking\nIt may seem super\ufb01cial and contra-dictory, but networking is incredibly important \u2013 not just for corpo-rations; not just for marketing and\nmaking a pro\ufb01t, but also for individu-als, and for innovation. Volunteering\nis another way to meet a whole range\nof people from totally di\ufb00erent backgrounds and walks of life. Keeping an\nopen mind and understanding other\npeople\u2019s perspectives is essential to\nour future development. The people you meet volunteering, whether\nit\u2019s fellow volunteers or the head of\nan NGO, could one day help you to\nrealise your ambitions. Volunteering\ncan also supply you with references\nfor job and internship applications.\nEven without the reference, research\nby Reed employment found that 73%\nemployers would hire candidates\nwho had volunteered over those who\nhadn\u2019t.\nDon\u2019tabeslaveofcircumstance\nHow easy is it\u2026You spend all day in\nlectures and labs, maybe do a stint\nin the Library, eat some dinner\u2026\nyou eventually have a chance to relax \u2013 what do you do? Hang out with\nfriends? Watch an episode of something with some really good looking\npeople in it? And then bed. And the\nsame thing the next day. And the one\nafter. Wake up!\nEvery now and then we need\nsomething new; a fresh perspective to really shake up our routine\nand to push us in a different di-rection. When you volunteer, you\nconstantly find yourself in new and\noccasionally uncomfortable situa-tions, and you deal with them. You\nbecome more comfortable with taking risks and putting yourself out\nthere, and you grow as a person. You\nlearn something about yourself too,\nmaybe a talent you didn\u2019t know you\npossessed, a career path you hadn\u2019t\nconsidered...\nThere are many, many more reasons\nwhy you should volun- t e e r.\nBut really, you just\nhave to give it a\ngo \u2013 I bet\nyou won\u2019t\nlook back.\nF o r\nsome\nm o r e\ninspiration,\nread on for\nsome examples of the\ngreat opportunities that\nexist here at\nImperial.\nS\nGreat opportunities that you can get involved in...\nStudent Action for Refugees\nStudent Action for Refugees (STAR)\nat Imperial is part of a national network of students working to improve\nthe lives of asylum seekers and refugees in the UK though volunteering\nand campaigning projects. Students\nfrom Nottingham University originally founded STAR 20 years ago, and the\nSTAR network now consists of 34 university groups \u2013 student volunteering\nat its best.\nInteract\nIf you\u2019re not sure you can make a regular commitment, Interact is the society for you. They organise a variety\nof one-o\ufb00, student-led volunteer projects in the local community around\nImperial. Past opportunities include\nhelping out at homeless shelters, visiting museums with the elderly and\nconservation projects.\nImperial Paediatrics\nImperial Paediatrics is an incredibly\npopular new initiative involving students from Imperial visiting patients\nin the paediatric ward at St. Mary\u2019s\nhospital, dedicating their time to making inpatients\u2019 stays as happy as pos-sible.\nTalk to me London\nAs part of Student Volunteering\nWeek, LSE, UCL and Imperial\nare launching a collaborative\nproject \u2013 \u201cTalk to me London\u201d. This student-led\ncampaign aims to tackle\nthe issue of social isolation by getting Londoners to talk to each\nother \u2013 on campus,\non the tube\u2026 every-where! Badges saying\n\u201cTalk to me London\u201d\nalong with cards\nwith conversation\nstarters have been\ndesigned and will be\ndistributed throughout\nthe week \u2013 get yours at\nthe JCR on Wednesday\n13th, or come along to the\nTalk to me London pub quiz\non Thursday! This project will\nhopefully embolden students to\nengage with their local community,\nand also create a great platform to\ndiscuss the power and impact of student volunteering.\nI truly believe that the value of volun-teering, and the attitude that surrounds it \u2013 one of respect,\ngenerosity and open-mindedness \u2013 cannot\nbe underestimated.\nThe point is: if you\nare volunteering your time\nfor a cause or\norganisation\nthat you feel\ng e nu i n el y\npassionate\nabout, you\ndon\u2019t begrudge this\ntime spent:\nyou want to\nbe there!\nWe are\nstudents at an\nincredibly academically intense\nuniversity \u2013 but\nalso one that values\ninnovation and interdis-ciplinary, creative research.\nIt is important for us to get out\nof our comfort zone every now and\nagain, to reassess our priorities and\nperspectives. To stay creative! Get\nout there and make a genuine di\ufb00erence. Learn something about your-self. Learn something about people.\nBecome a better person. Spend your\ntime IMPROVING A SITUATION.\nImagine how well you\u2019re going to\nsleep at night\u2026 and all this \u2013 for free.\nStudent Volunteering Week is the\nperfect opportunity to get involved.\nTo see the diversity of opportunities\nthere are out there, and to understand why the volunteering should\nplay a more central role in all of our\nlives. And if you\u2019re too busy next\nweek, drop us an email or come in\nfor a chat at the Imperial Hub. You\nnever know\u2026 you might end up feeling just as passionate about student\nvolunteering, and about the capacity\nof student volunteers to make things\nhappen, as we do.\nRegister for one of our events here:\nwww.imperialhub.org/svw2013\n\n"

This\nweek is the closest we get\nto a Valentine\u2019s issue, so I\nchanged the colour of the top bit and\nthe drop cap to red. How romantic.\nEducation and Student\nExperience\nThis was on last week\u2019s front page\nand is still going on. It\u2019s basically a\nchance for you to fill out text boxes\non different aspects of Education and\nthe Student Experience. It\u2019s a great\nidea, and is open to all students and\nstaff. Hopefully you all use it as an opportunity to give your thoughts/have\na massive moan/write an entire essay in text speak (delete as appropri-ate). The best thing about this is that\nthe Pro-Rector (Education) will be\npersonally reading the recommenda-tions. This means that you get to go\nstraight to the source with what you\nthink should be happening. Do you\nthink podcasts are great or a waste of\ntime? Do you think they are taking too\nlong to implement and you just need\nto get a camera set up and whack\nthem on YouTube, or do you want a\nslow phasing in? You\u2019re being given\nthe chance to have your say. I urge\nyou with all my heart (oh, Valentine\u2019s\nDay reference) to give your honest,\nfrank opinions about everything. Also,\ndon\u2019t sugar coat anything. What\u2019s the\npoint on holding back? Better to be\ncompletely upfront as opposed to tip\ntoeing around. Don\u2019t be afraid to say\nwhat you think, as it\u2019s all anonymous.\nIf you think you have a great idea, put\nyour name down in the comment box\nto bask in the glory.\nMaybe you are apathetic and think\nthat nothing will ever change. Well,\nthis is your chance to test that theory.\nIf you, and a lot of people you know, all\nput down similar suggestions and it\u2019s\nignored, you can then be satisfied that\nthere was a preordained outcome and\nit was just a consultation for consultations sake with an already decided\nstrategy. At least you\u2019ll have learnt\nyour lesson, and can know to never\nbother engaging again, keep your\nhead down, get your degree and get\nout of here. Or, the other answer could\nbe that your ideas are just terrible. Alternatively it could just be that loads\nof people thought something else and\nso that was acted upon. Either one.\nBut you seem like a clever person so\nit wouldn\u2019t be number two.\nTo summarise: fill out the survey!\nAnd give me a tenner. No? Okay, just\nfill out the survey then.

College and tests\nright after Christmas, Britain\u2019s coldest winter in 100\nmonths (complete with that\nmassive bout of dandru\ufb00 from heav-en), and the weather bo\ufb03ns are saying\nFebruary won\u2019t be much better. Not to\nworry, though: at times like these, you\ncan always count on a lovely, steaming\nmug of hot chocolate to make you nice\nand toasty (well, other than a warm\ncuddle from that special someone).\nNope, not cocoa, not that mug of Nesquick, Swiss Miss, Milo or whatever\nyou call it. There\u2019s a time and place\nfor that stu\ufb00, but today, we\u2019re going to\ndiscuss real hot chocolate \u2013 the stu\ufb00\nthat\u2019s thick, rich and unctuous, the\ndrink that warms you to your toes.\nWith that in mind, I decided to seek\nout the best hot chocolates around\nImperial. Make no mistake \u2013 this is\nno easy task. I had to sieve through a\nconsiderable number of insipid, weak\ncups masquerading as hot chocolate\n(some with ridiculous prices to boot,\nno less). Sure, one can make do with a\nsachet of Cadbury\u2019s stirred into boiling water or a cuppa from JCR, just\nas one can survive with nothing but\nSainsbury\u2019s basics, but it\u2019s not going to\nimpress that cutie from across the hall\n\u2013 and you gotta live a little, eh? Still,\nthere\u2019s a lot of hot chocolate out there,\nand only so much a student can a\ufb00ord.\nBeing the sel\ufb02ess and altruistic person\nthat I am, I shall aid you lot by sharing the results of my labours. So here\u2019s\nwhat you can \ufb01nd around school...\nChains \u2013 Paul, Caff\u00e9 Nero,\nStarbucks\nLowest on the rung are the eponymous co\ufb00ee and bread chains, Starbucks, Paul and Ca\ufb00\u00e9 Nero. Right o\ufb00\nthe bat, forget about Starbucks \u2013 there\nare far better ways to waste ~ \u00a33 than\na cup of overly sweet brown-tinged\nwater which barely resembles choco-late. Ca\ufb00\u00e9 Nero and Paul are far better \u2013 while Ca\ufb00\u00e9 Nero does have a\n\u2018normal\u2019 version, both serve a thick,\nEuropean cup of hot chocolate. However, I found Paul\u2019s to be rich, intense\nand very chocolate-y, whereas Ca\ufb00\u00e9\nNero\u2019s just seemed very sweet and had\na strong taste of cornstarch. It\u2019s quite a\nbit to pay for a drink, but for what you\nget, it\u2019s worth it.\nSpecial Chains \u2013 Gail\u2019s Artisan Bakery, Oddono\u2019s, Pain\nau Quotiden, Ottolenghis\nNext on the list come these places\nwhich are still chains, but are far posher by nature. Surprisingly, though, the\nhot chocolate here isn\u2019t much to shout\nabout. For all their exquisite looking\nbreads and decadent pastries, Gail\u2019s\nartisan bakery and Pain au Quotiden\nserve up rather lackadaisical mugs.\nPain\u2019s seemed very sweet and runny\nbut lacking in chocolate \ufb02avour, while\nGail\u2019s initially encouraging use of\npacket Valhrona hot chocolate was ruined by an inept use of the steam wand\nand an easy hand with the milk. Oddono\u2019s, one of the places many netizens\nrecommend for good hot chocolate,\nproved to be good - but the best still\ngoes to Ottolenghi\u2019s, the super-posh\ncaf\u00e9 with a stellar reputation that is\nwell deserved. The steaming mug delivers an intense hit of hot chocolate\nwhich isn\u2019t too sweet or too thick,\nand is extremely satisfying. Thing is,\nthe location may be a bit of a trek for\nmost.\nChocolatiers \u2013 Rococo\nChocolate, Hotel Chocolat,\nMelt, Cocomaya\nLast comes the cream of the crop \u2013\nplaces which exude luxury and class\nand make you feel intimidated from\nsimply staring through their windows.\nFeel free to stride in with gumption,\nthough \u2013 prices for something like hot\nchocolate at these chocolatiers don\u2019t\nreally di\ufb00er that much from other\nplaces. Still, there\u2019s a great deal of variValentine\u2019s heaven cupcakes!\nHot Chockablocked with warm drinks\nation between cups. Rococo serves a\nthick shot of chocolate that\u2019s more\nfondue-like in taste and consistency,\nand Melt\u2019s dark hot chocolate comes\nfrom a proprietary blend of in-store\nchocolate with a distinctive taste that\ncan only be described as \u2018interesting\u2019. For the thrill-seekers, maybe; but\nthe rest of us who want our money\u2019s\nworth would be better o\ufb00 going to\nHotel Chocolat. Despite its upmarket\nappearance, a mug to go costs a mere\n\u00a32.50 (paltry, really, in comparison)\nand comes in three \ufb02avours, all of\nwhich are intense, strong and delight-ful. Cocomaya\u2019s on the other hand was\nperfectly adequate, but just a little too\nthin and too expensive for its size.\nConclusion? Paul for that quick op-tion, or if one is truly craving for some\ndecent chocolate, head to High Street\nKensington\u2019s Hotel Chocolat for a\nmug. Even better, their Liquid Chocolat is available in stores so that any desperate student can whip up their own\nmug in the comforts of their hall kitchen \u2013 and you can add as many marshmallows (or other extras) as you want!\nThese divine cupcakes are perfect for\nthe occasion, whether you are celebrating or not!\nAnd guess what? You can make them\nyourself. They are extremely easy and\ntaste just as good as they look. You will\nde\ufb01nitely impress...\nIngredients:\n(Makes 12)\nRecipe taken and slightly modified from the\nbook Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World.\nFor the cupcakes:\n1 cup almond milk\n1 teaspoon vinegar\n3/4 cup sugar\n1/3 cup oil\n1 teaspoon vanilla\n1 cup \ufb02our\n1/3 cup cocoa\n3/4 teaspoon soda\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/4 cup strawberry marmalade\nFor the chocolate mousse:\n350 grams dark chocolate\n1 packet silken tofu\n2 tablespoons maple syrup\n1/4 cup almond milk\nFor decorating:\n5 strawberries\n1/4 cup blueberries\nProcedure:\nPreheat your oven to 180 degrees.\nPlace cupcake cases in a cupcake tin.\nIn a bowl, mix all the dry ingredi-ents. In a separate bowl mix the milk\nwith the vinegar and set aside for ten\nminutes so that it curdles. Then, add\nthe rest of the liquid ingredients to the\nmilk and vinegar mixture and mix. After that, add the liquid mixture to the\ndry ingredients and mix until the \ufb02our\nis dissolved. Be careful no to over mix\notherwise the cupcakes will not be\n\ufb02u\ufb00y.\nPour the mixture in the cupcake cases so that they are 2/3 full. Bake for 18\nto 20 minutes or until you can insert a\ntoothpick in the middle and it comes\nout dry.\nLeave the cupcakes to cool for 1\nhour. Once they are cool spread marmalade on top, creating a circle leaving 1cm from the edges. Place the\ncupcakes in the fridge.\nTo make the mousse, place the tofu,\nmilk and maple syrup in a blender.\nBlend until it is completely smooth.\nYou might need to use a spatula to stir\nand make sure that it is completely\nsmooth.\nMake a double boiler by putting\nwater in a large pot and then placing\na small pot on top so that the water\ncovers 1/2 the height of the small pot.\nBring to boil, turn the heat o\ufb00 and put\nthe chocolate cut in small pieces in the\nsmall pot. Stir until it has completely\nmelted. Leave the melted chocolate to\ncool for 5 minutes and then add it to\nthe blender. Again, blend until everything is completely combined. Put the\nmousse in the fridge for 1 hour.\nUsing a piping bag decorate the\ncupcakes with the mousse and place\na slice of fresh strawberry and some\nblueberries on top.

Imperial College\nachieved their strongest team \ufb01nish\nin the British University Cross Country Championships in recent memory\nwith the Men\u2019s A Team producing an\nincredible 6th place \ufb01nish in the long\n10km race at Bodington Hall Playing\nFields, Leeds University.\nEoghan J Totten (34:41) led the team\nhome with a 20th place \ufb01nish over\nthe 10km course, just over a minute\nshort of a medal (Stephen Scullion, St.\nMary\u2019s London, 33:32). He was strongly supported by a headstrong team\nwho battled ferociously through the\nmud-laden course to produce \ufb01nishes\nall within the top \ufb01fty. The American,\nClinton \u2018Abs\u2019 Cahall produced a massive 36th place \ufb01nish (35:23). Clinton\nhad to realign his concept of cross\ncountry to one more attuned to the\nEnglish weather, coping exceptionally\nwith the treacherous underfoot conditions and \ufb01nishing strongly. Christopher Bannon successfully transferred\nhis prowess on the track to the mud\nbath, producing a 47th place \ufb01nish (35:41) with Faron Hesse giving\nchase in 49th (35:43), moving strongly\nthrough the \ufb01eld in the closing lap.\nSam O\u2019Neill competing in his 6th and\n\ufb01nal BUCS competition, was the 5th\nImperial College man home (with\nfour to score), produced a solid run in\n168th place. First year Chris Thomas\nhad an interesting race after being ill\nthe previous week it appears he took 3\nhours to complete the course but who\nreally knows what happened here?\nWe look forward to seeing him progress in future years. The team result\nwas a tremendous achievement (top-ping Oxford) given four of the top \ufb01ve\nteam positions were occupied by Universities receiving signi\ufb01cant funding\nfor sport. The top three (St. Mary\u2019s\nLondon, Birmingham & Loughborough) receive funding from London\nMarathon and UK Athletics and are\nestablished endurance running insti-tutions. For Imperial College to be in\ntow shows that it is possible to balance\nsporting and academic prowess.\nNext up was the Women\u2019s race on\nwhat was now a tumultuous, freshly-churned course. Melissa NewtonMora led the Imperial College team\nhome in 169th position with Sophie\nKirk in 190th position and Kimberley\n\u2018very possible\u2019 Mason in 214th place.\nAll credit must go to Sophie for organising transport, accommodation\n(in the swish Jurys Inn!) and general\nco-ordination. However, the greatest\nachievement was the size of the Women\u2019s team from Imperial College; with\nall 12 completing the gruelling course\nmaking this double previous years!\nThere were a signi\ufb01cant number of\ncompetitors from the Cross Country\nclub in the Men\u2019s B race. The a\ufb00ectionately named \u2019Banter\u2019 B race saw\nover 400 runners take on the now shin\nhigh mud slog, and with experienced\nclub members Reuben Bogg (98th),\nJames \u2018Captain\u2019 Ellis (102nd), Ben\nToomer (127th) and Milan Misak taking the lead for the club, all 24 of the\nteam \ufb01nished.\nLiam \u2018Car park attendant\u2019 Smith and\nJean Claude Besse were the \ufb01rst freshmen to \ufb01nish, special congratulations\nto Jean Claude who had never seen so\nmuch mud during his triathlon career\nso far! Completing the second team\nwas Matt Douthwaite who made an\nincredible recovery from a squash\n\u2018injury\u2019 \ufb01nishing just behind Chris\n\u2018Zoolander\u2019 Charles. Many of the B\nteam were \ufb01rst timers so to see them\nall complete the course in respectable times was a great feat. Despite\nthe mud and cold smiles were evident\nall round particularly from Adrian\n\u2018Too Keen\u2019 Grutter who wore a grin\nthroughout so it can\u2019t have been that\nbad.\nFollowing the race, there was much\ncelebration not only for the 6th position but also celebrating the clubs successes thus far. This has been one of\nthe best years in the clubs history with\n100 members and participation going through the roof. Anticipation for\nthe infamous after party was high at\nCaptains\u2019 drinks, and with the freshers\u2019 challenges completed it was time\nfor curry! At Leeds University Union\nwe joined hundreds of other runners\nfor a celebration complete with foam.\nArmed with our bandannas we took\nto the \ufb02oor pulling moves that haven\u2019t\nbeen seen since last year. We certainly\nleft our mark at Leeds Union, I would\nsay more but what happens in Leeds\nstays in Leeds (or at least on Facebook). After 6 hours of partying it was\ntime to head back and get what sleep\nwe could for the long journey back\ndown south.\nFirst year Isabel Holding summed\nup her experiences of the weekend:\n\u201cAs a fresher it was a daunting thought\nto sign up for the XC weekend trip to\nLeeds. I was prepared to endure the\nphysical challenge of running 6.5km,\nas well as the freshman humiliation,\nwhich was probably my greater worry.\nLooking back this presentiment\nseems baseless and I am grateful that\nthe worst of it involved picking an\nitem of fruit or veg, giving it a face and\ncarrying it around with us for the entirety of the weekend; ensuring a dapper look at all times.\nOther than this, my experiences at\nBUCS involved: meeting people, mud,\ncurry, more mud, foam, and even\nMud, mud, glorious mud!\nSophie Kirk Sports Writers\nmore mud, (plus some running as\nwell). Overall, brilliant weekend!!\nThank you to the whole team for\nmaking the weekend so enjoyable, and\nwith Hyde Park Relays this weekend\nno doubt the fun shall continue. Hyde\nPark Relays is the place to be this Saturday, whether you are running, organising or supporting, so come on\ndown!\nEoghan J Totten\nPhotobombing seminars\nare given at lunchtime\nin the Sherfield building\nMmm...muscle, mud and man.

    "content": "Stem cells aid recovery from stroke\nSCIENCE\nProtein-building nanomachines\nSarah Byrne Science Writer\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\nInside every cell, tiny biological machines are hard at work, constructing\nthe proteins that will perform vital\nroles as enzymes, hormones, and a\nwide variety of other structural and\nbiochemical functions. These molecular machines, called ribosomes,\ntranslate our genetic code into a\nprotein sequence, and assemble the\namino-acid building blocks into the\npeptide chain that folds into a functional protein.\nResearchers led by Dave Leigh at\nManchester University have recently\ndeveloped an arti\ufb01cial nanoscale machine that can perform a similar func-tion. This consists of a ring-shaped\nmolecule called a rotaxane, which\nmoves along an axle on which amino\nacids have been loaded. A \u2018reactive\narm\u2019 then sequentially picks o\ufb00 each\namino acid and adds it to a chain attached to the rotaxane itself, forming\na new peptide molecule. Rotaxane nanomachines have been developed be-fore, but never one that can perform\nsequential actions like this. In results\npublished in Science (http://www.sci-encemag.org/content/339/6116/189)\nthis month, a peptide was successfully\nsynthesised in milligram quantities \u2013\na signi\ufb01cant amount and useful for\nanalysis \u2013 with an incredible 1018 of\nthe nanobots working in parallel.\nHowever, the synthetic \u2018ribosome\u2019\ncannot yet do everything a real one\ncan. It cannot, for example, read the\ngenetic code and determine which\norder the amino acids should be assembled in \u2013 these need to be preloaded onto the molecular axle. It is\nalso extremely slow compared to the\nreal ribosome, taking hours rather\nthan milliseconds to attach each new\namino acid.\nThere also may be some questions\nto be asked about the usefulness of the\napproach in general: whether trying\nto mimic the way nature does things\nis necessarily the best way. Nature is\nby de\ufb01nition messy and at times overly complex: biological systems tend\nto come with a lot of baggage from\ntheir evolutionary history, and the\nrandomness inherent in their devel-opment. If, for example, you want to\nsynthesise peptide chains, we already\nhave much simpler and more e\ufb03cient\nways of doing that in the lab, using\nstandard biochemical techniques.\nCuriously though, Prof. Leigh seems\nto hope that beyond being a fascinating proof-of-concept, the synthetic\nribosome will someday prove a more\ne\ufb00ective means of synthesising peptides than the current \u2018laborious\u2019\nprocess of chemical synthesis. This is\nperhaps not as unlikely as it sounds:\nresearchers have developed synthetic\nenzymes that are simpler and more\ne\ufb03cient than the natural versions. It\nis often entirely possible to improve\non nature, and with the new results\nemerging from the Leigh lab and the\nsynthetic biology \ufb01eld in general,\nthere are sure to be interesting developments to come.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1229753\nhe e\ufb00ects of a stroke can\nbe devastating, with the\ninitial loss of blood supply\nto part of the brain setting in motion a series of\nbiochemical events called the \u2018ischaemic cascade\u2019. This causes cumulative\ndamage to brain cells and blood vessels during the \ufb01rst few hours after the\nstroke, often resulting in severe and\nirreversible brain injury.\nHowever research has shown that\nprompt treatment with stem cells may\nbe able to interrupt this cascade, limiting the damage caused to the brain\nand improving the prospects of the\npatient making a good recovery.\nMost of us think of stem cells as\noriginating from the bone marrow,\nand this has traditionally been used as\nthe main source of adult stem cells for\nresearch and therapeutic purposes.\nBut there is another source of these\nso-called mesenchymal stem cells:\nadipose tissue, better known as body\nfat. In fact this is a very rich source\nof stem cells, yielding up to 500-1000\ntimes more than can be derived from\nbone marrow. It is also easier and less\ninvasive to collect cells from adipose\ntissue compared to extracting bone\nmarrow from a donor.\nResearchers at Neuroscience La Paz\nUniversity Hospital in Madrid recently studied and compared the e\ufb00ects\nof both bone marrow and adipose-derived stem cells for the \ufb01rst time,\nwith results published last week in the\njournal Stem Cell Research & Therapy.\nThe study looked at the e\ufb00ects of the\nstem cells when injected into rats, in\nwhich the e\ufb00ects of a stroke had been\ninduced by creating a blockage in\ntheir cerebral artery. The therapy was\ngiven 30 minutes after the \u2018stroke\u2019; and\nphysical abilities, brain function and\ncell death were measured over 14 days\nsubsequently.\nIn both cases, the rats receiving\nthe stem cell infusions showed signi\ufb01cantly improved function after 24\nhours, with an improved recovery also\nobserved after the full 14 days, compared to the control group. Changes\nin levels of \u2018brain repair markers\u2019 were\nalso observed, indicating that the stem\ncells were releasing growth factors\nand other substances in response to\nthe stroke-induced damage, helping\nthe damaged brain cells to repair and\nreplace themselves.\nThe e\ufb00ectiveness of stem cells in aiding recovery had been shown before,\nand this study added to the weight\nof evidence for them. However, most\nimportantly, it showed that there was\nno signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence in the e\ufb00ectiveness of adipose-derived stem cells\ncompared to those taken from bone\nmarrow. This points to adipose tissue\nas a potential source of plentiful, easy-to-obtain stem cells that could eventually be used for treatment of stroke in\nhuman patients. The success of the intravenous injection route of administration was also a positive note, as this\nis easier and less invasive than injecting directly into the artery or brain.\nFurther studies will be needed, the\nresearchers note, to establish safe and\ne\ufb00ective dosages in humans and to\ntest for potential side e\ufb00ects. However\nthis is a positive result for the prospects of new treatments for stroke,\nand advances our understanding of\njust how stem cells have their remarkable healing e\ufb00ects on our bodies.\nDOI: 10.1186/scrt159\nDeoxyribonucleic acid: THE BEST ACID\ndcjsr\nSarah Byrne investigates a new, fat-derived stem cell therapy\nRibosomes: nature\u2019s own\nprotein-building machine\nTiny protons?\nPhilip Kent Science Editor Picture: Arpad Horvath\nThe radius of a proton has generally\nbeen considered to be 0.87 femtom-eters (fm), an incredibly tiny amount.\nHowever, a paper published in Science\nearlier this year suggests this miniscule distance may be smaller than previously thought.\nA team from ETH Z\u00fcrich took a\nmuonic hydrogen, a hydrogen atom\nwhere the electron has been replaced\nwith a muon. Muons are similar to\nelectrons, but heavier, meaning it\nspends a longer period of time within\nthe proton\u2019s charge distribution. This\nmakes it easier to probe the size of the\nproton.\nInvestigation into the size yielded\nan inter-muon radius far less than\nanything reported previously, except a\nsimilar paper published in 2000.\nBoth papers used muonic hydrogen\nspectroscopy, a process where the muonic hydrogen atom is probed with a\nlaser to obtain data necessary to obtain a very accurate measurement as\nto the size of the nucleus. The newer\npaper, however, investigates using two\nenergy levels instead of just the one\nused previously, reducing a potential\nsource of error.\nScientists are confused by the two\n\ufb01ndings, both of which provide the\nsame value to a very small error. Muonic measurements do not correlate\nwith that of non-muonic hydrogen,\nleading to suspicion that a systematic\nerror in the experiment provides erroneously small results.\nInvestigation using muonic deuterium and muonic helium would allow\nresearchers to decide whether there is\nan experimental method to blame or\nnot.\nThere is also the potentital for error in the mathematical calculations\nneeded to convert the spectroscopic\ndata to a numerical value, the calculations and errors in which are in the\nprocess of being checked.\nHowever, if all sources of error are\nruled out, it must be the case that an\nentire new branch of physics is found,\nwith some arguing it could lead to a\nrethink of quantum electrodynamics.\nA conclusion as to whether the smaller protons are real or the product of a\nmathematical error will only be a matter of time.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1233202\nT\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\nmperial Hub will be bringing\nto you Imperial College\u2019s inaugural International Development Conference (IC IDC)\non 23rd February 2013. The\nconference will bring together leading thinkers in academia, government\nand global development to consider\n\u201cThe Role of Science and Technology\nin International Development\u201d.\nWith Imperial College having some\nof the brightest young minds in science and engineering, the theme for\nthis IDC at Imperial is the ideal way\nto introduce the topic of international\ndevelopment.\nBut why is development so impor-tant? In 2008, 1.29 billion people were\nliving below the poverty line (on less\nthan $1.25 per day). You might say\nit\u2019s not possible for us to make a difference and lift these people out of\npoverty, but estimates have suggested\nthat the extreme poverty rate between 1990 and 2008 was halved! So\nit\u2019s not just negative statistics that are\nhanging about, but instead the positive ones like these are inspirational.\nImagine what a di\ufb00erence the use of\nscience, technology and engineering\nin developing countries could make;\nhealthcare accessibility could be\nrapidly improved through the use of\nmobile technologies, access to education and learning could also be made\nequally accessible. Engineering applications can bring clean water to rural\ncommunities, something which we\ntake for granted on a day to day basis.\nWe only have two years left to reach\nthe UN\u2019s 2015 Millennium Development Goals and progress towards\nreaching these targets varies country\nby country. This is where we as young\nscientists and engineers play an increasingly important role. Over the\nnext decade, we will be the leading\n\ufb01gures in the world and we will be the\nones who have the chance to make a\nchange and reach the next set of tar-gets, what better place to start than at\nthe IC IDC?\nThe IDC will bring together speakers from a range of backgrounds together to discuss international development in an inspiring environment.\nSpeakers include Dr Kirsty Newman,\nfrom the UK\u2019s Department for International Development and Imperial\u2019s\nown Professor Alan Fenwick OBE\ntalking on infectious diseases.\nEarly bird tickets are now on sale\nat www.imperialidc.org at \u00a36 for stu-dents, which includes a day of seminars from leading speakers and your\nlunch!\nIC-IDC will be your opportunity\nto hear from leading speakers in the\nrealm of international development\nto see how you can be the one to\nmake a change and a positive global\nimpact.\nImperialCollege\nInternational\nDevelopment\nConference\nI\nMore information: Visit www.imperialidc.org\nTwitter: @ic_idc\nGet involved: Just drop an email to:\ndevelopment@imperialhub.org\nDhanvi Bosamia\nintroduces you to the\ninaugural event\n@feliximperial\nfacebook.com/FelixImperial\nfelixonline.co.uk\nWrite for us!

No\nPrevious nominee? Yes\nWinter\u2019s Bone (2011)\nWhy she will win:\nLawrence is also becoming a\nhousehold name in Hollywood\nas a young, fresh-faced,\nincredibly gifted actress\nwho can handle various\nroles ranging from small\nindependent \ufb01lms to huge,\nblockbuster movies. Her\nmost recent performance\nas an unstable woman gave\nthe critics plenty to cheer\nabout: singling out her mature\nperformance as one of the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s big highlights. Plus, she\nwon the SAG Award for Best\nActress, always a good sign\nwhen predicting the Oscars.\nWhy she won\u2019t win:\nIs she too young? Do 22 -year-olds win Best Actress Oscars?\nEmmanuelle Riva\nAmour\nPrevious winner? No\nPrevious nominee? No\nWhy she will win:\nThe oldest actress to have\never been nominated in this\ncategory (85!!!), distinguished\nFrench actress Riva got a\nsurprising but certainly\ndeserving nomination\nstarring in Michael Haneke\u2019s\nforeign indie favourite, with\na beautifully heart-wrenching\nperformance of a stroke victim\nthat eventually leaves her bed-bound and incapacitated.\nWhy she won\u2019t win:\nIt\u2019s very difficult to win in a\nforeign language performance,\nand only a handful of actors\nhave won in the past. In such\na tough category, and without\nmany wins so far, this one will\nhave to be all about the honour\nof being nominated.\nQuvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis\nBeasts of the Southern Wild\nPrevious winner? No\nPrevious nominee? No\nWhy she will win:\nThe youngest actress ever to\nbe nominated for the Best\nActress Oscar (9!!!), she was\neven younger (6!!!) during the\n\ufb01lming of Benh Zeitlin\u2019s indie\nhit. Hand-picked from over\n4,000 girls, her performance is\na fearless yet adorable one.\nWhy she won\u2019t win:\nNow she is de\ufb01nitely too\nyoung to win this thing. Young\nperformers have succeeded\nin the past to score some\n\u201cSupporting\u201d awards but\nwhenitcomestothe\u201cLeading\u201d\ncategory, more seasoned,\nmore experienced people tend\nto scoop the prize. This doesn\u2019t\ndiminish her startling efforts\nhowever, it\u2019s just that there\u2019s\nno way she\u2019ll win this year.\nNaomi Watts\nThe Impossible\nPrevious winner? No\nPrevious nominee? Yes\n21 Grams (2003)\nWhy she will win:\nOscar winning actress Reese\nWitherspoonwassoincredibly\nmoved by Watts\u2019 performance\nthat she wrote an open letter\npraising the actress\u2019 utterly\nfearless performance in Juan\nAntonio Bayona\u2019s tsunami\ndisaster family drama. And\nMs. Witherspoon is absolutely\nright: a performance of\nimmense strength as well as\nvulnerability, it\u2019s a powerful\ndisplay in one hell of an\nemotionally draining \ufb01lm.\nWhy she won\u2019t win:\nIt\u2019s just Watts representing\nthe \ufb01lm now, with the movie\nhaving been ignored on all\nfronts in other categories = not\na very good sign.\nJessica Chastain\nZero Dark Thirty\nPrevious winner? No\nPrevious nominee? Yes\nThe Help (2011)\nWhy she will win:\nChastain is on a roll, rapidly\nrising as one of the most\nsought-after actresses after\nonly a couple of years of\nexposure. Back in 2010, noone had heard of this talented\nindividual. 2011, all critics\ncould talk about was her\nextraordinary versatility. And\nthis year she has done it again,\nheading Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s\nwar drama to hunt Osama bin\nLaden.\nWhy she won\u2019t win:\nShe missed out on the vital\nScreen Actors Guild Award\nto fellow nominee Jennifer\nLawrence. Now this is by no\nmeans a straightaway loss but\nit does decrease her chances.\n\n"

On the 22 and 23 February, the\nsecond oldest varsity match after the\nOxbridge boat-race will take the stage\nfor the 111th year. The varsity is between the RSM and the Camborne\nSchool of Mines based in Cornwall,\nand is ultimately decided with a game\nof rugby that concludes a two day catalogue of sports.\nThe RSM and CSM began this\nsporting rivalry in December of 1906,\nplaying rugby against each other to\ndetermine which prestigious institution had greater athletic dominance.\n20 years later, the trophy was born\nafter students of the RSM stole a 3ft\nBottle from a Bass Brewery lorry and\nwas decorated with the crests of the\ntwo mining schools. The winner of\nthe rugby match gets to take home the\nBottle for the year, some of the more\nobservant of you may have noticed\nsuch a bottle proudly displayed behind\nthe Union Bar for the past two years.\nIn fact out of the last 17 Bottle Matches, the Royal School of Mines has won\na respectable 14.\nLast year, the RSM had a very convincing win against Camborne of 22-0; let\u2019s hope they bring us more of a\nchallenge this year. Despite the rugby\nbeing the climax of the weekend and\nthe ultimate decider of victory, the two\nmining schools now challenge each\nother in golf, netball, squash, hockey\nand football. Each of which has its\nown trophy and glory presented to the\nwinning institution. The RSM men\u2019s\nhockey team will be looking for their\n\ufb01rst victory since 2008, and the ladies\nwill be looking to overcome CSM for\nthe second time in three years. The\nfootball team is looking stronger than\never, and after holding CSM to a 0-0\ndraw last year will be looking to capi-talise on their home soil. Squash was\nsettled last year with a 5-0 victory to\nRSM, and golf was drawn at 2-2, but\nboth RSM teams are con\ufb01dent of\nNews Editors: Aemun\nReza, Nida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLewis Ryan RSMU President\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE IMPERIAL MEDICALS\n\u201cAN EXPLOSIVE CLASH,\nTHRILLING ENTERTAINMENT AND\nREAL EDGE-OF-YOUR-SEAT ACTION!\u201d\nLU C KY F O R W H O?\nVA R S I T Y\nV E N G E A N C E\n13.03.13\n/SPORTIMPERIAL\nMATCH TICKETS ARE FREE FOR IMPERIAL STUDENTS IF REGISTER IN ADVANCE!\nGET YOURS TODAY AT:\nWWW.IMPERIAL.AC.UK/SPORTS/VARSITY/TICKETS\njpr williams cup rugby match kick off 19.30 at the stoop stadium, twickenham\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR I\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nIN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN A\nA\nA\nA\nA\nAD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nDV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nVA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nAN\nN\nN\nNC\nC\nC\nCE\nE\nE\nE!\n!\n!\nvandalism. Everyone taking part in\nour events is aware of the negative effects that this kind of behaviour could\nbring to Imperial, the medical school\nand the charity we are collecting for.\u201d\nHowever, he also stressed that ICSMSU \u201cnever asked or even encouraged\nanyone to go to the UCL Union and it\nwas not one of the assigned pubs on\nour circle line route\u201d, adding that while\n\u201cRAG has organized the collect, [it]\ncannot be accountable for the actions\nof two irresponsible students acting\nout of their own accord\u201d. Furthermore\n\u201c RAG t shirts ... were bought by medics and non medics, so [it] cannot be\ncertain that [those involved] are part\nof the medical school\u201d.\nWhile neither ICSMSU nor the central Union have received any formal\ncomplaint from UCLU the ICSMSU\nplans to fully investigate the incident when its President, Shiv Vohra,\nreturns from annual leave later this\nmonth.\nbringing home their respective tro-phies. Finally, netball will be \ufb01ghting\nto come back from their undeserved\nloss last year, and re-establish their\nwinning streak over CSM.\nThe Royal School of Mines and\nCamborne School of Mines alternate in hosting the varsity weekend,\nand after a very successful trip down\nto Cornwall last year for RSM, Camborne will be taking the trip up to\nLondon this year. The Bottle Match\nis the de\ufb01nition of a great rivalry, and\nwith a great rivalry comes even greater support. Last year the RSM had\naround 200 keen supporters making\nthe cross-country journey, and it will\nnot be a surprise to have just as many\nCamborne miners at Harlington next\nSaturday. For the \ufb01rst time there will\nbe a food van and a bar open throughout the Saturday at Harlington, followed by the traditional player\u2019s dinner back at Imperial. The weekend is\ncapped o\ufb00 with an awards ceremony\nand after-party in Metric.\nAnyone is welcome to come along\nand support The Bottle Match, the\nSaturday (23rd) begins at Harlington\nat 9am, and the rugby will end the\nday kicking o\ufb00 at 2pm. Join us in the\nUnion from around 8pm for the after-party.

In this modern society, the taboo\nhas largely been lifted on\nsatisfying one\u2019s own sexual needs. You\nonly need to browse truelad.com for\n\ufb01ve mins to realise that most guys are\nprobably whacking one out in the \ufb01ve\nminute break between lectures. As for\nthe ladies, we\u2019ve gone one step further;\ncertain battery operated devices named\nafter innocent woodland creatures that\nare endowed with not one, but three\nspeed settings have been provided to\nsatisfy our needs. And although these\ndevices are life-savers, there is only so\nmuch love you can give yourself before\nthe asymmetry between the musculature of your right and left arm becomes\na bit of a giveaway. Solution: the fuck\nbuddy. A number you can dial when\nyou need to, someone who won\u2019t spend\nthe night and a relationship in which it\nis considered perfectly acceptable not\nto swallow. What could possibly go\nwrong?\nEverything. The mistake most people\nmake is to interpret the term \u2018buddy\u2019\ntoo literally. Do not, I repeat, do not\nselect an actual friend. At best they\nshould be a casual acquaintance. Why?\nBecause a) you already like this person\nenough for them to be your friend, b)\nJosh Price\nThen I saw her face, now I\u2019m a non-believer!\nA shameless plug by IC Atheists, Secularists and Humanists\neligion is one of those\nawkward words. To\nsome, it represents all\nthat is good in life, and\nthe celebration of the\ndivine. For others, it\u2019s a term which is\nalmost taboo, one of those awkward\nboxes that Facebook asks you to \ufb01ll\nin. Yet, there\u2019s no doubt that many religions have shaped past and present\nevents, and will no doubt continue to\ndo so for the foreseeable future. Or so\nyou might think; but just how many\npeople are still religious?\nThe 2011 census results show that\nthe total number of people with \u2018No\nReligion\u2019 was 25.1% of the total UK\npopulation, or 14.1 million people.\nIn 2001 this \ufb01gure stood at a total of\n14.8%. While we\u2019ve no doubt that the\n\ufb01gures for Imperial College itself are\nprobably rather di\ufb00erent, this is more\nthan just a large increase. So, then, as\nthis is clearly a piece which serves no\npurpose other than that of shameless\nself-promotion (read: encouraging dis-cussion), where is the Atheist society?\nWell, right here. 2 weeks ago, Imperial Atheist, Secularist and Humanist Society (or IASH as we like to be\nknown) came into existence. After a\nhighly successful inaugural talk (held\njointly with the Feminist Society),\nwe\u2019ve got a lot more things planned,\nbut \ufb01rst let us clarify a few points.\nTo whom do we cater and why do we\nexist? After all, surely an atheist society exists only to poke fun at speci\ufb01c\nreligions and circle jerk over how its\nmembers agree with one another?\nWell, not really, that\u2019s actually quite\nwrong.\nSo \ufb01rst o\ufb00, what do we believe? No\ndoubt you know of atheists who \ufb02at\nout don\u2019t believe in the idea God(s),\nor any other supernatural omnipotent entities. But what if that\u2019s not\nyour style? Some of us aren\u2019t so sure.\nPerhaps there\u2019s a God, or two, or even\nmore? You can\u2019t know for certain. We\nwelcome anyone who would be happy\nto label themselves as either of these,\nor anywhere in between. If you \ufb01nd\nyourself questioning God, scripture,\nor anything else to do with religion,\nwe\u2019d love to talk to you. We also consider ourselves secularists, we believe\nin the separation of Church and state,\nand that no religion should have any\nplace in the activities of government.\nWe also support the ideals of human-ism; living on the basis of reason and\nscience, and treating all others equally\nregardless of religion or belief.\nThat, in a nutshell, is what the majority of our members believe. But\nwhat do we aim to do? One thing we\ncannot stress enough is that discussion and debate are essential. It\u2019s obvious that curiosity about the world we\nlive in, interest in how things work, or\nthe desire to help people have provided the drive to obtain a place at Imperial. We seek to continue debate, and\nencourage others do so regardless of\ntheir beliefs. It may come as a surprise\nto some that this \ufb01ts perfectly with\nhumanism. So, to conclude; we exist\nas a social group for anyone who feels\nthat they \ufb01t the above labels. However,\njust like the many religious societies\nalready established, we will be hosting guest lecturers and taking part in\ndebates and discussions throughout\nthis and coming years. If this sounds\noverwhelmingly appealing or even\njust mildly interesting, we would very\nmuch like to see you: we are a friendly\nbunch (or at least we like to think so).\nOur next big event is at 6pm on 25th\nFebruary, where Robin Ince of Radio\n4 fame will be giving a lecture \u201cThe\nThings I am Thinking Right Now: a \ufb01nite life in a big universe\u201d. This will take\nplace in the Pippard Lecture Theatre,\non Level 5 of the Sher\ufb01eld building;\nand is open to all, free of charge. We\nencourage you to stop worrying about\nyour studies for a short while, and\ncome. You might just enjoy yourself.\nR\nyou think they are attractive enough to\nsleep with, and c) you will be sleeping\nwith them on a regular basis: one of you\nwill develop feelings. The trick in selecting the perfect fuck buddy is choosing\nsomeone you \ufb01nd almost repulsive on\nan emotional or intellectual level, but\nwhom you think is really quite \ufb01t (or\nfailing that, at least \ufb01t enough to stick\nyour cock in/have their cock stuck into\nyou). An added bonus is to select someone who you can\u2019t be with seriously due\nto externalities, e.g. a friend\u2019s ex, an exchange student, a convicted criminal\u2026\nThe key is to remember this is an exchange of goods (probably \ufb02uids, hopefully orgasms); it is not an exchange of\npersonal burdens, it is not about your\nfeelings, your friends, your coursework.\nTalking should be kept at a minimum at\nall times, but particular post coitus \u2013 a\nlittle dirty talk beforehand (i.e. verbal\nforeplay), however, is completely ac-ceptable. Sleepovers are never OK; if\nyou\u2019re telling yourself it\u2019s because it\u2019s\n\u2018practical\u2019\n, you\u2019re in denial: the reality\nis you want them to stay because you\nwant to spoon and you want to spoon\nbecause you like them. In which case\nyou are veering o\ufb00 the \u2018fuck buddy path\u2019\n,\nand onto the slippery slope to relation-shipdom.\nI have had two fuck buddy type ar-rangements. The \ufb01rst was a complete\ndisaster, although in the long run it actually turned out pretty well: we ended\nup dating for around two years (for the\nmajority of which I was deeply in love\nwith him). My second and current fuck\nbuddy meets all the criteria above:\nthere is no danger that I will develop\nfeelings for him, mainly because he is\na complete and utter twat. So far, the\nsex is adequate, he has a nice body and\na nice cock but he is a bit of a sel\ufb01sh\nlover (aren\u2019t they all?). I\u2019ve been seeing\nhim since November. So far what have I\nlearnt? As much as I like to pitch myself\nas a shit-hot, sexually liberated, independent woman and as much as I\u2019d like\ntobelieveyoucouldhavegreatsexwith-out succumbing to humdrum commit-ment, the truth is that prolonged sexual\nrelationships are always in\ufb01nitely more\nsatisfying with feelings involved. A vibrator will never and can never replace\na man, not because you miss the weight\nof his body on top of you but because\nyou miss the intimacy of being with another person. Likewise, guys may joke\nabout women only being superior to a\nwank because they come with a pair of\ntits and are self-lubricating, but actually\nthey too also crave emotional closeness\n.For this reason, although the idea of\nfuck buddies is conceptually attrac-tive, in reality they tend to only have a\nshelf life of a couple of months.

    "content": "SPORT\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\n46\nThe men\u2019s water polo team are midway through what has already been\nour most successful season to date.\nThis year we found ourselves in the\ntop division after being promoted last\nyear, along with Warwick, Oxford and\nCambridge in what some would call\nthe most intellectual sporting league\nin the UK.\nAfter our \ufb01rst match however, we\ncertainly thought much less of Warwick. Arriving one and a half hours\nlate for the match, some would be\nhappy to call it a walkover, but the\nImperial boys were keen to play and\nwe would not let some incompetent\nnavigator put us o\ufb00. Indeed it was total annihilation. Due to lateness Warwick were neglected a warm up and\nwere forced to jump straight into the\nmatch. They were sluggish in attack\nand defence, and Imperial could work\nthe ball easily around the arc and into\nthe pit. We were also superior on the\ncounters, with Andreas and Daniele\ntaking advantage of their less than\nable defence and goalie. Final result\n15-3 Imperial, the season ahead was\nlooking promising.\nUp next was an away game at Oxford. We once again had to be subject to Jackson\u2019s stereotypical, awful\nGreek driving \u2013 \u201coh I forgot I had to\nstop at red lights, it\u2019s not like being\non my bike\u201d. We made it to Oxford, in\none piece, just. This we knew would\nbe our hardest game of the league,\nand it was a physical, scrappy game.\nDaniele played so well in fact he was\nwrapped after the 2nd quarter; he\nclaims he just needed a rest. We were\nsubject to some very suspicious refereeing on Oxford\u2019s part, who managed to miss a very clear Imperial\ngoal, and award an Oxford goal that\nvery clearly hit the post. Going into\nthe \ufb01nal quarter with a minute left\nand 9-10 down, timeout was called\nby coach Adam to discuss a play that\ncould see us get equal. It worked to\nperfection and brought the score to\n10-10 with less than 40 seconds left.\nA strong Oxford attack followed and\nthey were awarded a penalty for reasons unknown. Of course the Oxford\nnumber 4 smashed it into the back of\nthe net, bringing the \ufb01nal score to a\ndisappointing 11-10 loss for Imperial.\nSpecial mention has to go out to Brad\nSanders for scoring 6 of our 10 goals,\nan almost impossible feat some would\nsay, but not for Brad. Not forgetting\nAndreas too who drove the bus back:\nfar better than Jackson, but still with\nthree stalls.\nFinally, our deciding match against\nCambridge was played just this last\nSunday. This served as the decider for\nwho went through to the semis, and it\nwas either Cambridge or us. This was\nto say the least, the most important\nmatch this season. We played a tight\ngame, with a drop defence to deal\nwith their tricky centre forward who\nwhenever got passed the ball found\nhimself drowned by 3 people. This\nworked wonders, save that of one or\ntwo sending outs, and subsequently\nonly allowed Cambridge to score 2\ngoals from out\ufb01eld play. Their third\ngoal came from a penalty, foolishly\ngiven away by Vincent. Thankfully at\nthis stage it didn\u2019t matter, as Imperial\nwere already 6-2 up with 1 minute\nto go, after strong o\ufb00ence from Nick\nMen\u2019s Water Polo handle their balls right\nAlex Simpson Mens Captain Von G, Andrea and Daniele. Daryl\nkept things under control in defence\nand we dread to think what these\nscore lines would be if it weren\u2019t for\nour ninja goalie Jen Wei.\nImperial have exceeded all expectations this year in the top division\nwhere we are normally relegated\nback to division 2. Never have we got\nthrough to the semi-\ufb01nals from the\ntop division before: a historic achievement for both coach Adam and captain Alex. We will now probably face\nBristol and Bath, along with Oxford\nagain in the semis at the University of\nBristol Pools on the weekend of the\n9th/10th March. If we\u2019re successful\nhere it\u2019ll be up to Leeds for the \ufb01nals\non the 23rd/24th March. Onwards\nand upwards!\nOn the morning of January 26th,\nthree Waterpolo girls teams arrived\nat Imperial from Nottingham, Norwich and Birmingham for a competitive weekend of games against\nthree London-based teams. Our own\ncaptain Lil had organized for all the\nmatches of our BUCS league to take\nplace on January 26th and 27th at\nEthos, and so we all had to get ready\nfor playing \ufb01ve matches in two days.\nThe Imperial ladies felt reasonably\n\ufb01t and reasonably con\ufb01dent of their\nability \u2013 although we had quite a few\nless substitutes than most of our opponents (especially King\u2019s, whose\nteam consisted of about 15 players\nand 3 poolside supporters).\nImperial played their \ufb01rst match\nagainst University of East Anglia,\nwhich was fairly tight and ended in\na 4-4 draw. After a 2-game rest Nottingham was easily defeated by 7-2.\nThis great score made us all highly\nenthusiastic. So enthusiastic in fact\nthat we all jumped into the pool while\nthe match preceding our next game\nwas still going on. Of course this was\nall our coach Adam\u2019s fault, who had\nconvinced us that the two teams were\nplaying the fourth quarter of their\nmatch instead of the third. Fortunate... and so do the women!\nAdina de Wit Sports Writer\nly this tiny mistake didn\u2019t set us back\ntoo much, as we won from Aston 4-3\nin a fairly tight match.\nAfter a successful Saturday everyone was excited (and yes, a little bit\nscared) about the Sunday matches\nagainst King\u2019s and UCL. With the\nmuscles still tired from the three\nbattles of the day before we didn\u2019t\nmanage to get enough goals past the\nKing\u2019s College goalie and the match\nresulted in a 4-3 loss. Four other\ngames separated us from our \ufb01nal\nmatch that was to determine whether\nor not we would go through to the\nsemi\ufb01nals. The spirits were lifted and\nwe started o\ufb00 energetically, but unfortunately UCL were too strong for\nus and they beat us 5-3.\nThis means that for us this year\u2019s\nBUCS ended after the weekend of the\n26th and 27th. We played as well as\nwe could and the results were better\nthan some of us had expected before-hand, so that still makes this result a\nsuccess!\nThe King\u2019s College ladies came in\n\ufb01rst in our league, and therefore they\nwill be promoted to the \ufb01rst division\nfor next year. With UCL coming sec-ond, these two teams will be competing in the semi\ufb01nals.\nCap tip to the ladies\nNo horses were harmed in the making of this photo\n\n"

In a study\nby The Turnip, over 60% of single Imperial males (99% of the Imperial male\npopulation) who are lonely and getting desperate (98% of the Imperial\nmale population) had read and memorised the entire Wikipedia entry. Reports suggest that some students even\nwatched a couple of highlight reels\non YouTube to understand what they\nwere going to see.\nOn the night itself, unprecedented\nnumbers of males were seen acting in\nan oddly masculine way and shouting \u201ctouchdown\u201d and \u201cquarterback\u201d\nnonsensically, whenever they thought\nthey may have seen an American with\na \u201cthing for a British accent\u201d. Imperial\nstudent, Rob Banking, told The Turnip, \u201cI gave it all I had. I\u2019d even looked\nup funny anecdotes about the play-ers. Something like brothers playing\nI think. Unfortunately, it all fell apart\nwhen a joke about the 49ers really being called the 69ers went astray\u201d. The\nlast straw seemed to come when Mr\nBanking made a reference to guns being \u201cnot great\u201d, only to be slapped in\nthe face.\nThe length of the game also confused some revellers. \u201cI thought that\nthe thing was over like 2 hours before\nit actually was\u201d, said James Stiriper.\nMany others had their stamina tested,\nin a way that their hand doesn\u2019t usually test, when they realised that for\nevery one minute of actual stu\ufb00 happening about 10 minutes of replays,\nadverts, people walking around on\nthe pitch, and referees making stupid\nhand gestures had to be endured.\nThe usually placid straight males\nwere also reported to have had to\n\u201ctry really hard to not look turned on\nwhen the cheerleaders were on the\nscreen\u201d.

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY 29\nin Wedgework V, another installation\npiece, this time by James Turrell, but\nI have no such luck. The work consists only of a wedge-shaped beam of\ncoloured light, mostly red, but with a\nthin line of blue at one end. As I sit in\nthe darkness something incredible oc-curs: the red begins to fade away, and\na bluey-purplish apparition begins to\nspread like mould across the wedge.\nThis then fades away as my eyes adjust\nto the light, and the scene is replaced\nby a solid wall of grey colour; I rub\nmy eyes, and the red light reappears.\nIt never actually changed colour, but\nTurrell has managed to create a piece\nwhich alters the viewer\u2019s sense of per-ception. It is truly astonishing.\nOther pieces are simpler, taking\ntheir inspiration from the beautiful \u2013\nand perhaps overlooked \u2013 sources of\nlight in the world around us. There\nis a bulb that emulates the glow of\nmoonlight, and a collection of glowing neon tubes which recreate the\nsplendour of twilight in Las Vegas.\nChromosaturation, by the Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez consists of\nthree rooms, each bathed in blue, red,\nor green light; upon entering the \ufb01rst\nroom everything is bathed in a cool\nblue light. Moving into the next room\nis literally painful \u2013 the red light is a\nbrilliant scarlet, and burns my retinas.\nHowever, this soon fades, and when I\nmove back to the blue room the cool\ntones have morphed into a brilliantly\nblinding cyan. Moving from blue to\ngreen turns the green light a vibrant\nyellow; moving from green to red, and\na vivid fuchsia appears. Of course the\nlight has never changed, it is only my\neyes becoming adjusted to certain frequencies of light \u2013 a simple e\ufb00ect, but\nincredibly powerful.\nThe works are not solely illusion-ary; some are political in scope. Jenny\nHolzer, an artist who has been using illuminated words for the last 30\nyears, displays a column of scrolling\nLED signs featuring extracts from declassi\ufb01ed US documents on the War\non Terror. The words scroll past the\nviewer, \ufb02ashing in harsh pink and purple lights, almost forcing us to read the\ngrisly details they confer. Iv\u00e1n Navaro\nhas created a glass box made of oneway mirrors. The viewer steps inside,\nand seems to inhabit an eternal abyss;\nthe \ufb02oor is not solid, all one can see is\na series of lights stretching down for\nwhat seems like eternity. The work is\nmade all the more powerful when one\nis reminded that Navaro grew up under Pinochet\u2019s regime, where people\nwould regularly \u2018disappear\u2019 if they displeased the government.\nThe exhibition closes with a kinetic\npiece by the Danish artist Olafur Eliasson, in which a garden of 27 fountains is illuminated by strobe lighting.\nThe e\ufb00ect of this is that it allows the\nviewer to observe the shapes made\nby the water in minute detail; images\nof the frozen fountains are imprinted\non the eyes, creating a scene of frozen\ndroplets, which hang like crystals in\nmid-air. The work is ever changing,\nconstantly shifting and morphing into\na new piece. It is completely hypnotis-ing; I manage to spend a good \ufb01fteen\nminutes alone in this room before\ntearing myself away.\nThe Hayward Gallery has always\nbeen a fantastic place to experience\nexperimental art, and in the last couple\nof years its interactive exhibitions have\ngone from strength to strength. This\nexhibition however, blows anything\nelse I have seen there completely out\nof the water.

    "content": "SPORT\n45\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA depleted ICUAFC 1s team made the\nlong journey down to Canterbury for\nthe second time this season; a trek so\nlong that Frodo and Sam would have\ncalled it quits once they had inevitably run out of lembas bread. Amjad,\nWedemeyer and Cherif Jnr were notable absentees, and with Murphy\n(Imperial\u2019s resident wildlife expert)\nin the Library and captain Woodhead\nout with a broken nail, the team had\na fresh new look to it. Thomas and\nDabbagh were called up from the 2s\nto make their \ufb01rst appearances for\nthe 1s this season, whilst new recruit\nJones was looking to impress. Imperial started the day top of the BUCS\nleague on 9 points from a possible 12,\nwith Canterbury in joint 2nd, making\nat least a draw imperative. Minds wandered back to 2 months before where\na defensive masterclass allowed Imperial to advance to the 3rd round of the\nBUCS cup on penalties, something\nthat Canterbury were sure to remem-ber.\nThe journey to Mordor, I mean\nCanterbury, took the best part of \ufb01ve\nmonths, and upon arrival most players\nhad forgotten the purpose of the jour-ney. Having had their memories re-freshed, a warm up took place for the\npurpose of getting accustomed to the\ninteresting and dynamic terrain. The\npitch was composed of approximately\n15 parts water to one part grass which\nwould serve to level the, ironically,\nuneven playing \ufb01eld; a gale force wind\nadded to the interesting conditions.\nWith Murphy absent, much of the interesting \ufb02ora and fauna on the side\nof the pitch went unnoticed, much to\nthe disappointment of approximately\nno one. Due to the aforementioned\nchanges in personnel, Hill was moved\nto centre back with Cherif Snr, with\nThomas given the nod at right back\nand Nielsen completing the back row.\nTim \u2018Smithy\u2019 Beasley was alongside\nJones in mid\ufb01eld with Maizonnier\nand To\ufb01s on the \ufb02anks. Robinson and\nBjorkstrand started up front together,\nin what has recently been a partnership more fruitful than the Garden of\nEden.\nImperial lost the toss and thus were\ndesignated to spend the \ufb01rst half in\nthe deep end of the pool (pitch); a\ncombination of bogginess (akin to\nthe Dead Marshes, North-West of\nMordor, minus the randomly strewn\ndead war victims), a prominent head\nwind and Apollo\u2019s mocking rays of\nlight would make for a tricky \ufb01rst 45\nminutes. From the o\ufb00 Imperial were\nmade to soak up pressure in precisely\nthe same way that the pitch didn\u2019t soak\nup water. Robinson was lively up top,\nmaking intelligent runs despite the\nabuse received from the Canterbury\nsta\ufb00 and subs, many of whom had the\nunique accolade of having IQs smaller than their shoe size. Although the\nconditions favoured Canterbury few\nclear cut chances were created by either team; that was until Canterbury\ndecided that what they really wanted\nwas to let in a goal. A Canterbury goal\nkick was taken short to the defender\nwho, in a surprising turn of events,\nplayed a sumptuous through ball to\nBjorkstrand. Bjorkstrand rounded the\nkeeper before placing the ball into the\nbottom corner with his left foot. The\nlack of celebration from Imperial was\na textbook example of how the team\nfully expected him to score. His strike\ndrew him level with goalkeeper Garner for number of goals scored for ICUAFC this season.\nThe goal seemed to kick start Canterbury who applied sustained pressure for the next 10 minutes. With half\ntime approaching, a Canterbury play-er, recently nominated for the Fallon\nD\u2019Floor award, went down under the\nmere presence of right back Thomas.\nThe referee, who up until this point\nhad been anonymous, decided this\nwas the chance to kick start his acting career and took centre stage by\nawarding a penalty. The penalty was\ndispatched, with Garner remaining\n\ufb01xated in the mud like some kind of\nhapless Medusa victim (or maybe like\nthose trolls in the Hobbit when Gandalf splits the rock and they get turned\nto stone by sunlight; basically something like that). The \ufb01rst half ended,\nbut not before Jones managed to ac-robatically head a Canterbury corner\nover his own bar from a yard out, even\nmanaging to draw praise from some of\nthe opposition.\nHalf time gave Imperial a chance to\ncatch their breath. At this point a draw\nwas widely considered a good score,\ngiven the conditions. It was widely\nagreed that the advantages of being at\nthe other end second half would provide an excellent opportunity to get a\nwin.\nThe e\ufb00ect of changing halves was\ninstantly noticeable and Imperial\nstarted to dominate. Not long after\nthe restart, a cynical foul on Nielsen\nallowed Hill the opportunity to \ufb02oat\na sumptuous ball through to Jones\nwho marked his debut with a Jack\nNicklaus-esque chip over the keeper;\n2-1 Imperial. Imperial were as desperate to get a third goal as Odysseus\nwas to once again reach his homeland\nof Ithica after the battle of Troy but,\nultimately, chances were few and far\nbetween. Bjorkstrand, with his taste\nof glory (which is in no way foreign to\nhim) whetted by his \ufb01rst, nearly scored\nhis second by attempting to de\ufb02ect a\nfree-kick into his own goal, but Garner managed to tip it onto the post.\nDabbagh replaced Thomas midway\nthrough the second period to provide\na pair of fresh legs and clean knees.\nBy this point the referee had become\nrelatively apocryphal, something that\nhe very quickly changed. A long ball\nplayed through to the Canterbury\nstriker produced no o\ufb00side \ufb02ag from\nsub Thomas who, correctly, waited\nuntil the opposition player touched it.\nThe striker \ufb01nished it bottom corner\nwhilst the referee ignored the o\ufb00side\n\ufb02ag, much to the frustration of the\nImperial players. This display of questionable sportsmanship especially\nupset Hill, who was irate and then\ncalmed down and then became irate\nagain, a cycle that repeated itself multiple times (\u201cmuch like a Polymerase\nChain Reaction\u201d \u2013 Amjad). The sense\nof injustice spurned on Imperial who\nNot drowning but waving?\nHenry Garner Sports Writer were looking dangerous on the wings\nwith To\ufb01s and Maizonnier working\nhard and Nielsen joining in a number of attacks. A corner towards the\nend of the game evaded everyone and\nsomehow did not end up in the back\nof the net, punishment for failure to\ngamble at the back stick.\nThe full time whistle blew leaving Imperial with mixed emotions; 2\npoints dropped seemed more appropriate than one point gained. Ultimately the draw was enough to maintain top spot in the league at the half\nway stage of the league and may yet\nprove to be vital point come the end\nof the season.\nGarner was voted man of the match,\nincreasing his lead at the top of Imperial\u2019s very own Fantasy Football but\nJones made a very promising debut\nand, despite the result, the team put\nin one of the better performances of\nthe season. The journey back is ongo-ing, and the team are expected back\nshortly before the summer ball.\nFootball tackles Canterbury on less than ideal terrain, with mixed results...\n18-22February\nweek-longcelebrationofthearts,music,dance\u2013and\neverythinginbetween\u2013thatImperialhastooffer!\nToweringBand\n18February,12:00,QueensLawn\nICBigBandkick-offArtsFest2013inspectacularstyle,performing\nontheQueensTowerBalcony!\nDanceNight\n18February,20:00,metric\nImperial\u2019sDancesocietiesperformashowcaseoftheirbest\nroutinesfollowedbyaCeilidhleadbyCaledoniansocietyandIC\nStringEnsemble!\nMeettheArtists\n19February,20:00,BlythGALLERY\nYourchancetomeetthestudentsfromPhotoandLeonardofine\nartssocietywhocreatedthisyear\u2019sBlythGalleryexhibition!\nCinemaFilmQuiz\n19February,20:45,UCH\nFollowingtheirshowingofSightseers,ICCinemawillhostaFilm\nQuizNight!\nICSymphonyOrchestra\n&ChoirOpenRehearsal\n20February,19:00,GREATHALL\nComeandseeICSOpreparefortheirspringconcert,whichtakes\nplaceinCadoganhallonthe2ndMarch.\nAVeryVocalEvening\n20February,20:00,UCH\nACapellaandMusicalTheatreteamupforaneveningof\nentertainmentandasneakpeakatMTSoc\u2019supcomingproduction\nof\u201cParade\u201d!\nImperialFringe\nTheArtsExperiment\n21February,17:00,iMPERIALmainEntrance.\nWitnessauniqueexperimentasImperial\u2019sgroundbreaking\nresearchcollideswithArtsFest!\nFringeAfterparty\n21February,20:00,Metric\nJointheImperialFringeparticipantsandorganisersinMetricas\nTheArtsExperimentcontinuesintothenight!\nunion.ic.ac.uk/arts/artsfest/2013\nEventssubjecttochange.Forcurrentinformationonartsfest13goto:\nvisitourfacebookpage\nImperialcollegeartfest\nRead this and\nmore online at\nfelixonline.\nco.uk\nDon\u2019t forget\nto fill out the\nDrugs Survey\nat: felixonline.\nco.uk/drugs\nProud to be sponsored by\n\n"

It\nis both the bane and boon of Android.\nWhen Google made Android open\nsource, it created a whole new set of\nproblems and opportunities for users.\nAndroid handset makers have created a whole plethora of devices, ranging from the low end to the highest\nend like the coveted Samsung Galaxy\nS3, for example. These devices across\nthe whole range of price points have\nhelped catapult Android to being the\nnumber one smartphone operating\nsystem worldwide. However it has\nalso caused numerous problems,\nboth for software developers\nand the handset manufactur-ers. Software developers \ufb01nd\nit hard to develop for the\nhuge range of devices and\nhandset manufacturers\nhave been notorious\nin their slow speed\nin the updating of\nAndroid phone\u2019s\nsoftware. Save for\nNexus line of\ndevices blessed by Google, it is hard\nto \ufb01nd any\nd e v i c e\no u t\nthere\nwith\nthe\nlatest version of Android within a\nfew months of its release by Google.\nThis is because manufacturers tend\nto move on to their next product very\nquickly after they have released them,\nreducing their commercial interests in\ncontinual support for older devices.\nBut Android is also open source.\nAnd the open source community has\nrisen up to the challenge of updating phones that have long since been\nabandoned by the manufacturers.\nBring forth Cyanogenmod.\nCyanogenmod is an \u201caftermarket\n\ufb01rmware\u201d for phones that is built entirely from the source code of Android\nreleased by Google. Cyanogenmod\nsupports a whole range of devices. It\nis the saviour of users who are unable\nto upgrade t h e i r\nphones\nl o n g\na b a n -doned by\ntheir manu-f a c t u r e r s ,\nand savour\nthe latest version of the Android OS. It can\nliterally bring a\nfresh breath of new\nlife to their ailing\nphones. It is also an\nopportunity for users\nwho dislike the skins and\ncustomisations that their\nphone manufacturers have slapped\nonto the phone to use something that\nhas less bloat.\nInspired by Cyanogenmod, many\nother developers have began their\nown projects that seek to bring more\nradical new features to Android. Projects such as Paranoid Android bring\nabout very innovative features like\n\u201cpie control\u201d and di\ufb00erent \u201cmodes\u201d\nto the phones. Projects such as these\nhave once again proven that open\nsource projects can bring about highly\ninnovative outcomes. The tenacity of\ndevelopers in supporting many devices that have long been ditched by the\ncommercial entities is probably one of\nthe best outcome that can come out of\nAndroid being open source.\nIt is hard to\nfind any device out there\nwith the latest version of\nAndroid\nThe dynamics between\nh a r d w a r e\nmanufacturers\ncreating too\nmany devices\nand developers making\naftermarket\n\ufb01rmware for\nphones create\na very unique\nc o n s i d e r ation for buyers seeking to\nbuy Android\ndevices.

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editor: Jason Parmar\nMaximilian Eggl\ntechology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nack in the early days\nof mobile electronics,\na BlackBerry phone\nwas the thing to have.\nThe \ufb01rst true smart-phone, BlackBerry (formerly known\nas RIM), was the \ufb01rst company to\nreally attempt to make a really portable computer. With the miniature\nkeyboard, BBM, Mail services etc, it\nreally was a success in the corporate\nmarket, as well as with the general\nconsumer. However with the advent\nof the touchscreen based smart-phone, BlackBerry failed to keep up\nwith the market. In fact over the last\n5 years their stock has shed more\nthan 90% of its value, wiping roughly\n70 billion dollars of the value of the\ncompany. They have released several\nfailures, most notably the Playbook\nand in general have been making\nlosses the last few quarters. Even\ntheir core business, the corporations\nand governments have started to\ndrop them in favour of Apple, Android and Microsoft.\nNow after a long delay, the lauded\nsaviour of the company, BlackBerry\n10 has been released (30th of Jan). A\ncomplete overhaul from the previous OS based on the software of the\ncompany QNX software systems, it\nhas the job of save the failing Canadian tech company. Available for all\nfuture BlackBerry devices, as well\nas the Playbook Tablets, hopefully\nallowing them to achieve their full\npotential. This OS released with the\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\n38\nB\nZ10 phone, which has no physical\n\u201chome button\u201d, means this OS is very\ngestured reliant. If BlackBerry decide\nto license (a \ufb01rst for the company)\nBB10 to other companies, this may\nor not a\ufb00ect if those devices have\nphysical buttons. The vast majority of actions are taken care of with\nswipes and \ufb02icks, with the tech giant having called this \u201cfeature\u201d Flow.\nWhile certainly innovative, it is a bit\nof a steep learning curve for those of\nus who like the occasional button on\ntheir phones. The standout features\nof BB10 include \u201cActive Frames\u201d,\nsimilar to Windows 8 tiles, where a\n\u201cpreview\u201d of the app with live info is\ndisplayed, as well as \u201cpeek\u201d, a window\nwith all your noti\ufb01cations which is\nin fact seems very similar to the noti\ufb01cations centre in iOS. There are\nseveral other features, including a\nbrand new Camera app, browser and\nnew BBM. However all these things\ndon\u2019t really feel new, as most have\nbeen seen either on Android, iOS or\nWindows 8. The only thing that really stands out for me is \ufb02ow, and I\ncan\u2019t wait to get a hands-on with that\nCrackberry or Crapberry?\nMaximilian Eggl looks at the fortunes of a different fruity company\nThe News Bubble\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up to date\nwith the newest, weirdest and most futuristic things around.\nDell buys...Dell...?\nMicheal Dell, founder of the third largest computer manufacturer, is\nbuying back his own company in a bid to make it competitive again.\nMaybe it will actually work!\n3 Clicks of Freedom\nRecently a report was published, describing how an innocent video\nof sesame street on youtube can lead to a rather graphic video of a\nwoman giving birth. Thus a child can relatively easily access explicit\nnudity as well as violence. What we all have to take from this? Sesame\nstreet is bad, M\u2019kay!\nNew Apple Interface?\nApparently Apple is looking for someone in a job ad to help them completely\nredesign Mac OS as well as iOS. With the firing of Scott Forstall, and with\nJohnathan Ive in charge we probably will see lots of changes!\nLeave-Facebook Syndrome\nFacebook data now reveals that two thirds of their users log off for\nweeks at a time. Apparently due to them not being able to deal with\nthe drama of their friends and boredom of general Facebook. While\nthis may not impact Facebook directly, it might show that this social\nnetwork has lost its appeal.\nInstagram on the PC\nInstagram is not mobile exclusive anymore! For all you who are Instagram ad-dicts, this is just another way to feed your addiction. For anyone else it doesn\u2019t\nreally make that much of a difference.\n\u201d\nsaviour of the company, BlackBerry potential. This OS released with the can t wait to get a hands on with that\n\u201c\nThe vast\nmajority of\nactions are\ntaken care\nswipes and\nflicks\nto see how it works. Lastly concerning the OS, BlackBerry have now\nrebranded the app store, calling it\nBlackBerry World. This store now\nhas roughly 70,000 apps with more\ncoming every day due to the tech\ncompany\u2019s increased encouragement in making apps for BB10 (e.g.\nPortathons for developers)\nAs well as releasing a new operating system, they released two new\ndevices, the Z10 a full touchscreen\nphone as well as the Q10, which\nremains in line design-wise like its\npredecessors. The Z10 looks like a\nbeautiful phone, with a powerful\nprocessor and generally good specs.\nHowever, I do agree with some crit-ics, that although well designed, it\ndoes look similar to most smartphones out there. This will make it\nharder for the average Joe to pick\nit out of the multitude of other de-vices. However recent sales \ufb01gures\nin the UK have beaten expectations,\nwith the white Z10 being sold out\nquite rapidly.\nThe Q10, release date purported\nto be mid-2013 on the other hand is\nvintage BlackBerry, with its instantly\nrecognisable keyboard. It also has a\ntouchscreen, similar to the Storm.\nTwo new beautiful phones, one \u2018new\u2019 and one \u2018old\u2019, with some serious specs behind them. Honestly, I wish I had one...\nWith quite respectable specs, I can\nsee this phone being quite a hit. All\nin all the Z10\u2019s task to attract attention back to BlackBerry, and get with\nthe times, while the second is more\nof an o\ufb00er to the corporate world as\nwell as the hardcore fans.\nThe big question is if the Canadian\nTech company can slow the descent,\nand return to the world stage of the\nbig phone makers. The delay with the\nrelease BB10 did not help, as expectation of the new products has just\nrisen as well as pressure on BlackBerry. The OS does seem promising,\nand the two new phones look good\non paper, yet it may be a case of too\nlittle, too late. While some critics\nhave been praising the bold steps\nthat BlackBerry are taking, others\nare not that optimistic citing a strong\nopposition in the smartphone mar-ket. Investor con\ufb01dence is very low,\nwith the stock price sinking immediately after the new product release.\nHowever things do seem to be on the\nup. After the Super Bowl ad (the \ufb01rst\nin the companies history), the stock\nhas risen, and the new products have\nbeen quite a success. Could this be\nthe start of a long and arduous journey for BlackBerry\u2019s back to the top?\n\n"

Whether you\u2019re in the\nmood for romance, bro-mance, an XX-only party,\nor a takeaway for one, this duo of Felix\u2019s current go-to co-op games will\nget your pulse racing this Valentine\u2019s\nDay. And if you don\u2019t have a special\nsomeone/something close to your\nheart, we\u2019ll always have each other the\ninternet.\nUnsurprisingly, the sequel to the 2005\ntactical shooter Sniper Elite, Sniper\nElite V2 sees you ripping your way\nthrough Berlin, and anyone who looks\nat you slightly odd. The campaign coop plays as you would expect \u2013 both\nplayers are identical in gameplay\nterms. You\u2019ll look di\ufb00erent, and you\ncan choose di\ufb00erent weapon loadouts\nat the start of each mission, but that\u2019s\nabout as far as your individuality gets.\nThat being said, the co-op playth-rough of the game with the people\nin the Felix o\ufb03ce couldn\u2019t exactly be\ncalled \u2018stealthy\u2019, so it seems like quite\na di\ufb00erent game, when compared to\nthe solo campaign. We found it much\neasier just to run around and snipe\neveryone, with no care being put into\nhiding bodies. There\u2019s no reward for\nbeing unnoticed, so we never really\nbothered.\nAs a team, your goal is to halt the\nwork on the V2 rocket project, by\nplacing bullets in the heads of those\nwho helped create the weapons. The\nlevels feel open at times, with large\nareas to make your way through, yet\nat other points, it just feels like you\u2019re\nbeing bottlenecked, ready for the next\ntrap. We tried to have one player act\nas a runner, and another one providing covering \ufb01re, but it\u2019s not long till\nyou reach a point where you need\nboth players together, so that plan falls\napart quickly. Use Overwatch for that.\nWith hidden Nazi gold and well...\nwine bottles, there\u2019s a bit of replay-ability, but the sole attraction of this\ngame is not just the co-op campaign.\nThere is a variety of non-storyline\nmodes that are great for you and your\nplus-one. There are three extra modes\n\u2013 Overwatch, Bombing Run and Kill\nTally. Overwatch sees two di\ufb00erent\nroles for the players \u2013 one player is\na sniper, and the other is a ri\ufb02e-less\nrunner, who has to make their way\nthrough the piles of bodies to get\nplans/set bombs/mark targets \u2013 you\nget the idea. This is the one-and-only\ngame mode where you can\u2019t revive the\nother player, which actually makes you\ndepend on your partner a lot more.\nSecondly, Bombing Run has the two\nof you running through ruins trying to\nrepair an escape vehicle, before your\ntimer runs out and you are blown to\npieces in a bombing run. The third and\n\ufb01nal mode \u2013 Kill Tally, is your run of\nthe mill horde mode.\nI would say the main gimmick of\nthe game is the slew of slow-motion\nvideos you get when you head-shot\nan enemy, (even slower motion when\nyou hit the fuel cap of a tank, or a wine\nbottle), but that kinda implies that it\ngets boring after a while, and I don\u2019t\nthink it does. Thankfully, both players\nonly share slow-motion kills when it\u2019s\nsomething big, so your partner can\ncontinue covering the walls of Berlin\nwith knee-originating blood-spatter,\nwhilst you enjoy getting those sweet,\nsweet headshots.\nYou don\u2019t have to aim for body parts\neither, to get the most bang-per-bul-let. Aiming at the grenades on your\ntarget\u2019s belts always leads to a satisfying explosion, and can save ammo if\nit\u2019s scarce.\nThe graphics are great (and don\u2019t\nseem taxing on average computer\nhardware) as is the audio and music,\nso I\u2019ve no quibbles there. One thing I\nwill question, however, is the choice of\nthe overused over-the-shoulder camera view. I think we would prefer to\nplay this as an FPS, as the controls can\nfeel a little \u2018clunky\u2019 as they current are.\nThe game is currently out on Steam\n(\u00a329.99), PS3 and 360, so if you fancy\na night in, taking people out, then I\u2019d\nhighly recommend this game.\nL\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\nValentine\u2019s Day: The Heist\nRoss Webster\nKeeps his money\nunder his mattress\nNothing says \u201cI love you\u201d more than\nrobbing a bank together.

You\u2019re not\nreally the bad guys in all this though,\nas you\u2019re not just going for banks, but\nyou\u2019re more often tasked with stealing\nmoney gained through illegal means.\nThink of yourselves as a modern Robin\nHood and his band of merry miscre-ants, as you don\u2019t give the money to the\npoor afterwards (unless you include\nyourselves).\nTeamwork is key in this game, along\nwith communication. The levels will\nsee the team separated as the drills/\ncircular saws/computers have jammed\nor crashed at the most inopportune\ntimes, and on opposite sides of the\nmap, so you need to be able to trust\neach other.\nWhat I love about Payday, is that the\ngames are pseudo-random, and that\nthe di\ufb03culty curve is punishing. For\nexample, in one mission, you\u2019ll have\na limo dropped onto a roof. However,\nthere\u2019s a good chance that it\u2019ll break\nthrough the ceiling and fall down a\nstairwell, stopping at any \ufb02oor. Enemies can spawn from random locations around this randomly-located\ncar, so it\u2019s tough to get a strategy that\nworks everytime. Overkill (the highest\ndi\ufb03culty that most people will encoun-ter) alters parts of the level sometimes\n\u2013 possibly \ufb01lling a once-safe room with\ntimed explosives that\u2019ll turn you into\npink mist if you\u2019re not fast enough.\nThere\u2019s a simple levelling system,\nwhere you don\u2019t use experience for\nimproving your equipment, but cold,\nhard cash. Headshots etc. won\u2019t give\nyou more points, but it\u2019ll mean you\nactually get to live long enough to possibly \ufb01nish the level. There are three\n(four if you get the Wolf Pack DLC) different unlock routes \u2013 assault, sharp-shooter, support (and technician, with\nthe DLC). Any time during a mission,\nyou can change which path you\u2019re on,\nand when you pick up enough money\nto increase your reputation level, you\nget the unlock from that class. The\npath you travel has no impact on your\ngameplay, and due to some upgrades\nbeing locked until you reach a certain\nlevel, it\u2019s impossible to simply expand\nalong one tree \u2013 you need to diversify.\nWith this system, until you\u2019re at the\nhighest levels, there\u2019s a good chance\nyour team will all have slightly di\ufb00erent unlocks.\nYour enemy in this game is the po-lice, in all it\u2019s shapes and forms. The\nenemies will dribble in, until there\u2019s\nAim for the heart... and try not to miss\nan assault, when you\u2019ll be swamped\nby unlimited enemies until the timer\nruns out. Just like L4D2 (there\u2019s a lot\nof inter-weaving of the two universes,\nI won\u2019t spoil much) there are special\ncops \u2013 some with tazers, riot shields,\nsnipers and the dreaded bulldozer,\nmore a\ufb00ectionately known as \u2018that\ngoddamn astronaut guy\u2019, so it\u2019s not always a one-sided slaughter of cops.\nStealth isn\u2019t needed in this game, but\nit helps. There\u2019s one mission where you\ncan \ufb01nish without anyone even noticing you there, whilst on others, the police are going to turn up at a set time,\nand you can\u2019t stop it from happening.\nIf there is one modern game that I\nwould have to tout as having the largest replayability value, this game would\nbe one of the top contenders. Just a few\nmonths ago, a team managed to \ufb01nd a\nmassive hidden vault in the \ufb01rst level\n\u2013 it took months of research and work\nto complete the puzzles needed to\nreach the \ufb01nal vault. Payday 2 is in the\nworks, and it should be a great game\nif they follow the same recipe \u2013 I have\nonly one request \u2013 give a versus mode,\nwhere humans can play as the special\ncops, trying to stop the heisters.\nHe\u2019s gonna have to see\nan... um... *flips pages*\n\u201costeopath\u201d after that.\nMan, this dictionary\nthing sure is fun!\nGames Editor\u2019s note \u2013 the Felix Games\nteam takes no responsibilty for broken\nhearts, poisoned meals, cakes which\nturned out to be lies, or wine bottles\nwhich suddenly make the world go in\nslow motion.\nI could make a joke\nabout the only real\nthieves being the\nbankers, but that\u2019d\nbe unfair. Oh, wait...\nEnough gold to\nreach rep level 2?\nTime to grind\n36\n\n"

    "content": "A Quantum Murder\nAlex Savell gives part two of the Peter F. Hamilton\nSF detective series the pre-Picocon treatment\non\u2019t get me wrong, I\nhave not done a U-Turn\non the Greg Mandel\nseries in the last week;\nI am neither an Italian,\nnor a member of a Coalition Government. I am still an advocate of the series and of the man, and will be in avid\nattendance when he speaks at the SciFi Society\u2019s Picocon Convention in a\nlittle over a week\u2019s time.\nI am, however, a little unsure of the\noveruse of the word Quantum. Published in 1994, a year after the \ufb01rst of\nthe series, A Quantum Murder was\nconceived when the Q word was still\nthe buzz word of the time. We can at\nleast be thankful that Hamilton did\nnot go along with \u2018black-hole\u2019, a similarly popular 90s buzzword, which\nwouldn\u2019t have even had the snappy\nring of Greg Mandel continuing on in\ntrue detective novel style.\nGetting over my minimal gripe\nabout titling we start to see why Hamilton doesn\u2019t consider this series a tril-ogy. Though it is more true of the \ufb01nal\nbook of the series the title does work\nas a stand-alone despite several returning characters including the Event\nHorizon heiress Julia Evens and even\nthe return of the massive conglomerate itself. A classic \u2018who-dunnit\u2019 murder mystery set in a country estate\nthat manages to evoke the nostalgia\nof a man clinging to tradition while\nmerging this with the home of a paranoid scientist in the high-tech future.\nA much tighter, more atmospheric\nplot with more interplay between\ncharacters than Mindstar Rising this\nis the sort of thing where you see why\nMandel is good at his job. If you look\nclosely you\u2019ll see that the Will Smith\n\ufb01lm I, Robot where it diverges from\nthe revolutionary Asimov classic has\nsome striking similarities to the plot of\nA Quantum Murder. A secretive professor murdered in a seemingly impossible fashion leaves high tech clues\nto the way to solve his murder. In fact\nit\u2019s a tale that\u2019s been told many times,\nThe Da Vinci Code, for instance, is also\nnot so very di\ufb00erent. But remember\nthat Hamilton is a trailblazer in this.\nAnd, in fact, there is plenty to help\nHamilton stand out from the crowd\nof mystery writers; the backdrop of\nan England clawing its way back from\nthe brink, or possibly past it, has progressed a little in the two years that\nhave passed in setting.\nSeeing the country move forwards\na little in this is an interesting experi-ence. At the same time technology is\nstarting to become more integrated;\nperhaps that\u2019s a mark of the crowds\nGreg is starting to circulate within,\ncertainly the estate is a level of prestige and technology that isn\u2019t available\nelsewhere.\nIn fact, it\u2019s the sort of think tank style\nsetup that is a Physicist\u2019s wet dream.\nStill the levels of technology remain\nbelievably attainable in the near fu-ture, but they are gently progressing\nalong with everything else and with\nthe \ufb01nal instalment The Nano Flower\nset some time further on, A Quantum\nMurder provides an interesting hint of\nwhat might be coming from the last\nbook.\nIn fact I am certain it is no accident\nthat researchers are a feature of this\nbook, providing solid evidence of the\nway the world is moving on and how\nhard fought that struggle is. And next\nweek we will have a look at just how\nfar things progress in a decade and a\nhalf and I will leave you to discover if\nand how Mandel manages to unravel\nthe sinister motives of Double Nobel\nLaureate Edward Kitchener\u2019s demise\nand a plot he\u2019s more integral too than\nhe could possibly have thought.\nPeter F. Hamilton will be at Imperial\nCollege for Picocon 30 on Saturday.\nFebruary 16. As one of the Guests of\nHonour he will give an individual talk\nand participate in the main panel with\nSteph Swainston, Richard Morgan,\nKate Gri\ufb03n and Jaine Fenn.

The urban fantasy sub-genre is\nbecoming increasingly popular but\nGri\ufb03n shows here, as in her previous work, that she is still someone to\nwatch, even in such a crowded \ufb01eld.\nYou don\u2019t have to have read that series\nto still enjoy Stray Souls, but there is\nsome crossover and reading the earlier books \ufb01rst wouldn\u2019t hurt.\nOne major di\ufb00erence between the\nseries is that, while the Matthew\nSwift books do have an undercurrent\nof humour, the laughs in Stray Souls\nare a lot more prominent, which is a\nlarge part of the reason why I found it\nso entertaining.\nThe book centres on Sharon Li, a\nbarista who\u2019s just discovered she\u2019s a\nshaman, able to become one with the\ncity. Problem is, the city\u2019s soul appears to be missing, someone needs\nto save it and that someone seems to\nbe her. And what would any of us do\nif we found ourselves in such a situa-tion? Use Facebook and Twitter to set\nup a self-help group for fellow magical\nbeings, of course!\nSharon is an interesting counterpoint to the more wacky secondary\ncharacters like Kevin the hypochondriac vampire or Sally the art-loving\nbanshee, both of whom are part of the\nself-help group. She could have easily\nbeen lost amidst all of them, and she\ndoes spend a lot of the book dithering,\nbut in a way this just makes her easier\nto relate to.\nSome people might struggle to get\non with the book\u2019s short chapters, but\nI found the structure kept the story\ngoing at a decent pace, plus the chapters from the point of view of all the\ndi\ufb00erent characters really suited the\nself-help motif in addition to providing more opportunities for comedy.\nI also particularly enjoyed the naturalistic dialogue and how it added to\nthe mundane side of things, as contrasted with the magical, which was\nitself a great source of humour. This\nbook also achieves the not inconsiderable feat of working social media\ninto a narrative in a way that\u2019s actually meaningful and enjoyable.\nMy principal feeling about the book\nis that it\u2019s just really fun. Obviously\nyour mileage may vary, but if you like\nyour fantasy to not take itself too seriously (without sacri\ufb01cing plot or\naction), with description that\u2019s vivid\nwithout being \ufb02orid and plenty of\nmemorable characters \u2013 or even if\nyou just get a kick out of reading stories set in places with which you\u2019re familiar \u2013 then Stray Souls is de\ufb01nitely\none to seek out.\nKate Gri\ufb03n is a pen name used by the\ntwice Carnegie-nominated fantasy\nauthor Catherine Webb for her adult\n\ufb01ction.

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n33\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\ngenius, Alfred Hitchcock\u201d\nJohn Park Film Editor\nThe Girl\nDirector: Julian Jarrold\nScreenwriters: Gwyneth Hughes,\nDonald Spoto\nStarring: Toby Jones, Sienna Miller,\nPenelope Wilton, Imelda Staunton\nTippi Hedren is not in the least bit\ninhibited when it comes to talking\nabout the relationship she had with\ndirector Alfred Hitchcock. Starring\nin two of his \ufb01lms The Birds and\nMarnie, Hedren got the \ufb01rst-hand\nexperience of the eccentric direc-tor, and claims she was subjected to\ncontinuous harsh, unfair treatment\nand cruelty under a genius, brilliant\ndirector who had a rather unhealthy\nobsession for the rising starlet. These\nclaims, of course, come years after\nhis death, after Hedren spoke warmly\nof the director whilst he was receiving his American Film Institute\u2019s\nLifetime Achievement Award, claims\nthat have also been refuted by other\nactresses (Kim Novak, Eva Marie\nSaint) who had also worked closely\nwith him. So the degree of authenticity of her accusations is di\ufb03cult\nto judge no doubt, but there is also a\nbelievable amount of substance here\nto make for a potentially intriguing\nmovie. That there were no sexual\nharassment laws back in the day to\nprotect working actresses supposedly\nprevented Hedren from taking much\naction. And here is what should be\ndescribed as a partially \ufb01ctionalised\naccount of how Hedren became but\nultimately declined the role of becoming Hitchcock\u2019s next \u201cGirl.\u201d\nHedren (Miller) is barely starting\nout in the industry when she catches the eyes of Hitchcock (Jones) and\nhe is immediately captivated by her\nlooks and her potential to become the\nnext big star in his \ufb01lms. Her screen-test is successful, and her overnight\nstardom appears to be well underway.\nAnd despite her very limited experience in the acting industry (she had\na successful modelling career prior\nto this move), Hitchcock personally\ntakes her under his wing, with the\nyoung beauty experiencing all sorts\nof glittering bene\ufb01ts of being tied to\none of the most in\ufb02uential \ufb01gures in\nHollywood. But it becomes all too\nclear soon enough that his interest\nin her is not entirely an innocent one.\nAs Hitchcock\u2019s infatuation moves\npast the long stares, he swiftly decides to quite literally throw himself onto the vulnerable actress. She\nmanages to fend him o\ufb00 when he\nputs his predatory moves on her in a\ncar, an action that deeply upsets and\ntroubles her. But with a daughter to\nsupport, her chance to become a big\nstar, and also at the kindly advice of\nHitchcock\u2019s secretary Peggy Robertson (Wilton), she decides to forget\nabout the incident and soldier on. A\nsmall sacri\ufb01ce to pay it seems, for a\nguaranteed future. But his approach\nbecomes more and more direct as\ntime goes by, and becomes challenging to cope with. He even tells her\ndirectly that in exchange for being\nunder exclusive contract with the\ndirector, she needs to obey his com-mands. It all seems ludicrously one-sided but hey, Tippi Hedren insists\nthings like this were commonplace in\nthe \ufb01lm industry back in the day.\nWith repeated rejections Hitchcock resorts to even sneakier, slier\nand more despicable methods to get\nback at his young blonde obsession.\nThe \ufb01lm in production, The Birds, requires its lead actress, Hedren, to be\nattacked repeatedly by vicious birds.\nAnd Hedren is given assurance that\nthese birds will be mechanical and\nthat the set will be a safe environ-ment. So imagine her surprise when\nshe discovers that real birds in cages\nare being prepped to be set free to\n\ufb02y all over the actress. Even worse,\nHitchcock requests for several days\nof the same take, leaving Hedren exhausted and traumatised. Not getting\nwhat he wants, he resorts to bullying\nher, physically and emotionally.\nPlayed by the steely determined\nMiller, Hedren was right to be pleased\nwith the casting of the actress to play\nher. She starts o\ufb00 as the innocent\nand na\u00efve woman whose dream has\ncome true thanks to a timely Diet\nCoke advert, but her quiet, persistent\nstrength shows in her necessary coldness towards her legendary director,\nfearing the possibility of an end to\nher short-lived career, but also holding onto her dignity. She possesses\nthe beauty and icy glamour of the\nactress in the 1960s, and comfortably\nsettles into the lavish background atmosphere that has been impeccably\nset up for her by the technical team.\nFor someone portrayed in such a\nnegative light, Jones tries to bring out\nas much sympathy in his character\nas possible. Essentially his character\nboils down to being a sex-crazed maniac who pines for his leading ladies;\ninappropriately and relentlessly pursuing relationships with them. And\nyet there is almost a child-like fascination and curiosity in his eyes as\nhe never gives up chasing the things\nhe cannot have. His interactions with\nhis wife Alma (Staunton) are brie\ufb02y\nglossed over, and a sub-plot involves\nhow the long-su\ufb00ering wife decides\nto take o\ufb00 for a few days after a particularly bad episode in their mar-riage; this is when he realises that in\nfact, without his wife, his life is quite\nmeaningless. It is in these brief moments of weaknesses that the audience can feel sympathy towards the\notherwise very much unlikable direc-tor. The feeling never lasts long, but\nthose scenes to come.\nIt all sets up to become a nice little piece of television soap drama set\nin the 60s, where we would also get\nthe recreation of some of the famous\nscenes of Hitchcock\u2019s fascinating The\nBirds. The main problem here, how-ever, is quite simply how lifeless and\ndull everything feels. The \ufb01lm has already done a tremendous job in \ufb01nding the right cast members to play\nthe big names, but when it comes to\ntelling the story, it feels muddled and\nconfused, never quite establishing a\nconvincing enough link between its\ncharacters. It feels oddly detached,\nand moves at such a dreary pace that\nit becomes di\ufb03cult to maintain any\nsense of serious drama or any tension\nin the narrative. It\u2019s a relatively short\n\ufb01lm too, and yet it still struggles to\nengage with the viewers on any level.\nForget about the one-sided view\nargument. Yes, we\u2019ll probably never\nknow the real truth behind what\nactually happened on the sets and\nwhat Hitchcock\u2019s true motivations\nand desires were, but this still could\nhave made for a fun, trashy television\nmovie. The Girl doesn\u2019t even come\nclose to being that. Instead what we\nhave here is a \ufb01lm more interested\nin relishing in its artistic side, trying\nto make everything look pretty and\nauthentic. And on that front the \ufb01lm\nsucceeds \u2013 but it\u2019s a real shame that\nstyle takes over substance a few too\nmany times to tell a coherent story.\nThe Girl is available on DVD.\nMy vibrator has a light on it\nL, is for the way you look at me...!\n\n"

    "content": "Happy catecholamine day\nLooking forward to your hot date? Philippa Skett explains why\nL\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\n14\nLove Science?\n(We know you engineers do too)\nWhy not write for us? Get in touch!\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFollow us on Facebook, where we\u2019ll post up any\ninteresting stuff we stumble upon (science-related, obvi-ously).\nove is a many-splendored\nthing, according to ex-perts. As someone who\nconsiders themselves a\nscientist and, depending\non how many glasses of wine I have\nhad, someone who has been in love,\nthis week of all weeks I couldn\u2019t help\nbut wonder, what exactly is love? Does\nit bene\ufb01t us as a species? Is it an evolutionary hangover regarding altruism and mating preference, skewered\nby social etiquette? Or is it sel\ufb01shness,\nprojected on someone as a need to be\nwith them, but in reality an obsession\nto obtain their gametes for you, and\nonly you, and not share these amazing genes with anyone else? These certainly cross my mind whenever I am\neyeing up someone in Metric, but for\nothers it may not be as crystal clear.\nAnd when I mean love, what exactly\ndo I mean? The love I am referring to\nis the sort that caused Ryan Gosling\nto grow a beard and build that house.\nThe sort that made Joseph GordonLevitt stroll into the park and sing and\ndance with what didn\u2019t seem like a coincidental arrangement of people for\na Saturday morning. The sort of love\nthat when Dumbledore asked, \u201cAfter\nall this time?\u201d made Snape reply, \u201cAlways.\u201d I don\u2019t mean the love between a\nmother and her daughter, a man and\nhis dog, or a biologist and their agar\nplates. These are still legitimate forces\nof adoration and come under the large\numbrella of the term love too, but\nin this case, it is romantic love that\nseems to need the constant dissection\nto understand it or justify behaviour\ndone in the name of love.\nThis love is explained not so delicately by Helen Fisher, an anthro-pologist, but a scientist nonetheless.\nShe sorts the progression of love into\nthree discrete but not necessarily independent stages; lust, attraction, and\nattachment. These three are not listed\nin chronological order in terms of a\nromantic relationship\u2019s development\nas they are very much interchange-able. Each of these three stages comes\nwith di\ufb00erent boosts of hormones\nthroughout the brain, to accommodate the di\ufb00erent life strategies that\nare optimal for di\ufb00erent stages in\nmammalian reproduction. Love is literally all in your head, although it can\ncause the usual racing of the heart,\nsweating of the palms or high quantities of alcohol ingestion too (or possibly chlamydia).\nFor example, lust accommodates\nthe sex drive and the wish to mate\nand reproduce recklessly and repeat-edly, regardless of where said mate lies\non the Imperial scale. It is associated\nwith oestrogens and androgens \u2013 hormones that work for the reproductive\nside of things in the body, and are regulated within the hypothalamus. It is\npurely a chemical surge to want to get\nhot and heavy very suddenly, and can\nsubside as quickly as it came (one orgasm joke in the bag). This neurological wiring is completely independent\nof attraction, which can explain just\nhow easy it can be at times to kick\nthat rugby guy out of your bed after a\ndrunken night out.\nAttraction, however, is associated\nwith catecholamines (organic com-pounds) like dopamine, which can\nact as neuromodulators \u2013 that is,\nthey induce prolonged, neurologi-cally derived emotive incentives to\nwant someone, and that person only.\nIt was pointed out by the big man\nhimself, Darwin, that attraction facilitates mating preference as opposed\nto just mating alone (a masturbation\njoke? You decide). Heightened levels\nof these hormones are linked to the\n\u201creward centres\u201d of the brain, making\nyou think that the obsession you are\nnurturing is a great thing, as monogamous mating seems apt for bringing\nup the o\ufb00spring of Homo sapiens,\namong others.\nAttraction is the part where you\nconsider the partner to be able to suit\nboth yourself and your possible o\ufb00spring in emotive traits and physical\ntraits needed for resource acquisition and prolonged companionship.\nIntense attraction is considered to\nbe this \u201clove thing\u201d people get upset about, and Fisher ruthlessly lists\nwhat psychological properties are\nassociated with this stage of hormonal peaks \u2013 intrusive thinking about\nthis person, a longing for emotional\nreciprocity, a feeling of uncontrollable\npassion, the eagerness to reorder daily\npriorities to be available to this loved\nperson and the willingness to sacri\ufb01ce\nfor them...the list goes on and on.\nAlthough such a list reads like Sheldon Cooper\u2019s diary entries as opposed\nto that Valentine\u2019s card you probably won\u2019t be getting, no doubt it will\nresonate with some of the more love-struck students out there. Ever found\nyourself \ufb01nishing revision half an\nhour early to buy that special someone a jacket potato in the Library\nCaf\u00e9? You might be in love mate. This\nis the sel\ufb01sh element of love \u2013 and\nif it is requited can solidify a mating\npair for optimal o\ufb00spring survival and\nmake sure no-one else steals those\ngolden gametes.\nFinally, attachment is associated\nwith long term companionship.\nLinked to oxytocin and vasopressin\nrelease in the hypothalamus of the\nbrain, these act to maintain monogamous attachments between organisms and encourages mutual parental\nbehaviour. This stage does bode well\nif it follows the lust of actually making a baby, then the attraction needed\nto keep the parents together through\nthe pregnancy, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be so. It has been suggested that this is the case for successful arranged marriages, or even in\nlong lasting friendship. Even without\nthe hormonal surges associated with\nlust and attraction, such couples can\nsustain a happy family environment\nregardless of not being hopeless fools\nor copulating like horny teenagers at\nsome point.\nSo with this little guide to the science behind love now in your hands,\nplease refrain from using it as some\nsort of aid to pick up girls after a few\ntoo many pints. No girl wants to hear\nhow you can trigger oestrogen release\nin her in the shortest time ever. The\nsame goes to lovestruck girls; please\ndon\u2019t attempt to tell that guy whose\nback of head you have been staring at\nin lectures for most of last term that\nhe gets your catecholamine level soar-ing.\nDeclaring love seems to work well\nby doing so through poetry, literature,\ninterpretive dance, or even via tequila\nshots. So depending on your audience,\nconsider using these methods instead\nthis Valentine\u2019s Day to snag yourself\na date, but feel free to keep in mind\nwhat might be going on under the skin\ntoo. However, if I do \ufb01nd a card in my\nlocker declaring how you want to\ngrow old with me and stimulate vasopressin release within me, don\u2019t think\nI will be put o\ufb00 too much either.\nFacebook facebook.com/Felixscience\n\u201c\nEver found\nyourself\nfinishing\nrevision\nhalf an hour\nearly to buy\nthat special\nsomeone a\njacket potato\nin the library\ncaf\u00e9?\nhttp://lauraconsistentlyinconsistent.blogspot.co.uk\nhttp://amaliehoward.com\nIf only chemicals looked like this,\nwould make lab a lot more fun\nIf your heart looks like this, Felix\nScience advises seeing a doctor\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n31\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\nt the end of last year I\ntried to put together a\nmixtape containing my\nfavourite tunes of 2012.\nBut I couldn\u2019t do it. My\niTunes library just didn\u2019t do 2012 jus-tice, and this got me wondering why\nthat was. It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve gone \u2018cold\u2019\non new music; I\u2019m probably listening\nto more than ever, just in a di\ufb00erent\nway. Two or three years ago I was\n\ufb01nding music on blogs then heading\nto megaupload for a bit of socially\nacceptable thievery. Perhaps a combination of the internet federales\u2019\ncrackdown on the Kim Dotcoms of\nthis world and my paid subscription\nto Spotify, but I pretty much stopped\ndownloading music.\nNow, however, I realise that it\u2019s the\nhumble wireless (or the 21st Century\nequivalent: BBC iPlayer) that\u2019s been\nholding my musical attention. In a\nworld where technologies and ways\nof consuming media are born, blow\nAMS album of the week\nUnknown Mortal Orchestra\u2019s self-ti-tled 2011 debut album did a great job of\nsoundtracking my Freshers\u2019 Week with its\nwarm fuzzy tones. I\u2019m now midway through\nmy second year, and UMO have returned\nwith an album that is fresh yet nostalgic.\nQuite a few of its songs offer more than just\na nod to the psychedelic rock of the 1960s,\nwhilst dealing with themes of withdrawal\nand isolation.\nAlbum opener and absolute cracker \u2018From the Sun\u2019 begins as a mellow guitar ditty with lovely harmonies you\u2019d expect from the likes of Grizzly Bear,\nand ends as a punchy foot-stomper, with vocalist and songwriter Ruban Nielson crooning throughout with the wisdom of someone that\u2019s spent a bit too\nmuch time indoors.\nI\u2019d be tempted to say this album is written with more of a band set-up in\nmind than the first, but I\u2019ve seen them perform the latter and it was pretty\nfuggin\u2019 great.\nAnother treat for the ears is the soul laden \u2018So Good at Being in Trouble\u2019,\nwith one of the best vocal melodies I\u2019ve heard in a long (sad, lonely) time.\n\u2018Swim and Sleep (Like a Shark)\u2019 is as cute and playful as the name suggests.\nDespite the lack of complicated instrumentation, there\u2019s no \u201cstripped back\u201d\nfeeling, rather a charm that is super effective at showcasing the excellent\nsongwriting.\nMy main gripe with this album, if I had to have one, is that some of it\nsounds suspiciously similar to the debut. I\u2019m not saying artists have to be in\na constant state of reinvention, but two and a half years is not long enough\nto have plausibly forgotten and rediscovered one of your own basslines. One\nthing I feel obliged to point out is that the track \u2018Faded in the Morning\u2019 runs\n4:20 minutes long. Yeahhh\u2026\nI thoroughly recommend this album for pretty much everyone, even if you\nrolled your eyes at the very name of this segment. It is an unpretentious, una-bashed, psyche-funk-indie-rock corker.\nLongLivetheRadioStar\nSimon Hunter on why radio is still as relevant as ever\nup and become obsolete within years,\nthe fact that radio is as relevant today\nas it was almost a century ago is quite\nstaggering. 90% of the population\nlisten to the radio every week and,\non average, those listeners absorb a\nwhopping 22 hours of music, news\nand Nick Grimshaw\u2019s drivel. Digital\nradio and the internet have made it\nall the easier to avoid Scott Mills and\n\ufb01nd something you actually want to\nlisten to, and now almost 20% of us\nare using our mobile phones to tune\nin as well.\nThe BBC\u2019s continual evolution with\nthe times is laudable. For such a large,\nstu\ufb00y corporation it would have been\neasy for them to plough all their resources into daytime Radio 1 for the\nkids and Radio 2 for the grown-ups.\nBut the Beeb 1\u2019s musical \ufb01nger is\ndead on the pulse of the dance music scene here in the UK with Benji B\nand new-recruit Jackmaster getting\nserious airtime. In fact Gilles Peterson\u2019s departure from the station\nwas a blessing in disguise as he now\nresides over on 6 Music where he is\ngiven 3 hours, every Saturday, to spin\nthe \ufb01nest cuts from all worldly gen-res. And let\u2019s not forget Pete Tong\nand The Esssssential Mix \u2013 undoubtedly the most respected DJ mix series\nin the world. As for 6 Music, the quality they chuck out never fails to blow\nmy mind, but I\u2019ll not go on about that\nhere - for one I\u2019ll sound like one of\nthose pretentious types who believe\nthey saved the station from closure\nby ticking an online petition. I mean,\nI did that, but no one wants to sound\nlike that...\nBut more than the BBC\u2019s continual\nrelevance, it\u2019s the Rinse FMs and Boiler Rooms of the radio world that are\npushing the boundaries of what radio\nis, as well as bringing music out from\nthe underground. Rinse FM has been\naround for almost two decades now,\nbroadcasting for 16 of those years as\na pirate station. The sheer tenacity of\nkeeping a pirate station broadcasting\nfor that period of time is hugely im-pressive. And were it not for the efforts of the dedicated DJs and geezers\nwho let them use their bedrooms to\nbroadcast from, the likes of Grime\nand Dubstep probably wouldn\u2019t be\nthe forces that they are today. In 2010\nRinse \ufb01nally got the appreciation it\ndeserved and was given a license to\nbroadcast on 106.8 FM.\nMy \ufb01nal tribute to radio is aimed\nat the Boiler Room. The online station\u2019s climb, starting with a few lads\nDJing to each other in a grimy London room three years ago, to a worldwide radio/podcast/party behemoth\nis almost incomprehensible. A couple\nof years ago you\u2019d look forward to\nTuesday night to see which London\nDJ would be spinning to roughly one\nhundred privileged guests and a few\nthousand online listeners. Now, a\ndi\ufb00erent party is held almost every\nnight in Berlin, Los Angeles, Sydney, New York or London, and all are\nstreamed right to your living room,\nblurring the boundaries of radio, TV\nand the club.\nI\u2019ve obviously only talked about my\nthoughts on the state of radio in the\nareas of music that I love. No doubt\nmany of you have di\ufb00ering opinions\nand experiences (hell, write a piece\nand send it in), but to me radio is the\nmost important source of music \u2013\nboth new and old \u2013 around. And all\nthis ninety years after the \ufb01rst entertainment radio station started broadcasting in Britain.\nGrouper\u2019sGhostlyMaritimeExplorations\nBerlin-based record label PAN have a\ntough act to follow this year given the\nstrength of the line up curated by label\nowner Bill Kouligas in 2012. Releases\nsuch as those from Lee Gamble, Heatsick,andHelm,amongstothers,received\nwidespread critical acclaim for their cutting edge visions of contemporary experimental electronic music, making frequent appearances on the \u201cBest of 2012\u201d\nlists of critics and artists alike. Given the\nhitherto unfaltering creative vision of the\nlabel it should not come as too much of\na surprise that PAN\u2019s \ufb01rst release of 2013\ncharts yet another high-water mark on\ntheir continued upward trajectory.\nCommercial Mouth, is the debut LP of\nGreek sound-collagist Jar Mo\ufb00, whose\nunique strain of plunderphonics and\ntape manipulation is a natural \ufb01t for\nPAN alongside labelmates Joseph Hammer, Jason Lescalleet, and Gh\u00e9dalia\nTazart\u00e8s. While Mo\ufb00\u2019s process may be\nsimilar to that of some of his colleagues,\nthe results are uniquely refreshing. Rarely letting his source material give away\nits identity, he instead tears samples into\ntinyfragmentsandpiecesthembackinto\nsomething wholly unrecognisable, never\nrelying on the clich\u00e9 of using samples as\nironic cultural references. The source\nmaterial that astute listeners have managed to identify include excerpts from\ncomposer Michel Chion\u2019s Requiem and\nexperimental duo Musique Concret\u2019s\n\u2018Bringing Up Baby\u2019\n, works of musique\nconcr\u00e8te that themselves have already\nbeen pieced together from a myriad of\nacousmatic sounds. Mo\ufb00 mercilessly\ndisassembles them again, looping, dis-torting, and heavily layering his samples with artful precision. The result is\ntwo exceptionally strong twelve minute\nsides, unrelenting, seething maelstroms\nof samples. New noises constantly spring\nto the foreground and themes assemble\nthemselves organically, just barely \ufb02ourishing before being submerged under\nfresh waves of sound.\nOn the A-side, \u2018Tziaitzomanasou\u2019\n, a\nrhythmic basis is provided in places by\na series of clattering mechanical loops\nover which all manner of samples tumble endlessly, including what can only\nbe described as sci-\ufb01 \ufb01lm sound e\ufb00ects.\nMo\ufb00\u2019ssparinguseofrhythmicloopsgive\nthe listener some orientation in what\nwould otherwise be fairly unnavigable\nterritory and unlike some of his earlier\ndemo work he never resorts to a bland\ndrum machine palette to provide this,\nrather favouring the organic nature of\nconcr\u00e8tesounds.ThetitletrackontheBside is a slightly darker a\ufb00air. Beginning\nwith what sounds like a spectacularly\nmalfunctioning machine, layered snippets of Ayler-esque saxophone improvisation brie\ufb02y burst forth before being\nMatt Earnshaw Writer\nengulfed by exhilarating, nightmarish\nsplinters of acousmatic found-sound,\nwhich no extended metaphor can do\nadequate justice, but that will assuredly\nleave your head spinning even when the\nrecord has stopped.\nTo coincide with the release of Commercial Mouth, Mo\ufb00\u2019s 2011 single \u2018Vidv\u2019\nwas re-issued on CD (albeit as a highly\nlimited edition of thirty \ufb01ve, so readers will be best o\ufb00 pursuing it as a free\ndownload on leavingrecords.com where\nit is listed under the title Vid-R). \u2018Vidv\u2019\nruns in much the same vein as the Commercial Mouth material with a near\ndanceablepsychedelicopeningsequence\ngiving way to the trademark disorienting\nsound collage technique that he went on\nto perfect on the new material. Although\nit doesn\u2019t quite reach the same levels of\nintensity as the Commercial Mouth cuts,\nit is still a worthy morsel that should go\nsome way towards satiating the inevitablepostprandialappetiteforMo\ufb00\u2019swork\nthat you\u2019ll work up whilst digesting the\nbrilliant Commercial Mouth. All eyes\nare on PAN\u2019s next move in anticipation\nof what underground gem Kouligas will\nunearth next.\nUnknown Mortal Orchestra: II\nA\nYasmin Malik\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\n4 FRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\nNews Editors: Aemun\nReza, Nida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNSS Response: what has changed\nhe National Student Survey (NSS) is completed\nby every \ufb01nal year undergraduate student across\nthe country and has been\nrun since 2005 by HEFCE, an organisation responsible for public funding of\nEnglish universities. Being the only way\nto assess student experience throughout their time in university on a national scale, it plays a crucial role in university ranking process and is widely held\nresponsible for the poor performance\nin the Sunday Times League Table for\n2012 entry, where Imperial lost 11 posi-tions.\nFollowing the NSS 2011 results,\nthe Union President at the time Scott\nHeath, Deputy President (Education)\nJason Parmer and the Representative\nCoordinator came up with a report,\nwhich provided 35 recommendations\non how to improve student experience at Imperial. A year later current\nUnion President Paul Beaumont and\nDeputy President (Education) Doug\nHunt report on the progress made following those recommendations, as well\nas coming up with new ones to further\nimprove student satisfaction. According to them, \u201cImperial College Union\ntakes the NSS results seriously because\nwe believe our students should be satis\ufb01ed with the world class education they\nreceive.\u2019 They also note that \u2018potential\ntalented students should also not be\ndeterred from applying to Imperial by\nlooking at our national league table\nrankings, brought down by the NSS results.\u201d\nSome of the suggestions made by\nthe Union were fully embodied by the\nCollege. When it comes to rewarding innovation in teaching there have\nbeen great improvements with the\nUnion providing funding for a teaching awards system run by students. The\nUnion plans to extend the awards to\ninclude research supervisors since over\n20% of Imperial\u2019s students are research\npostgraduates. Another success of the\npast year is the campaign \u2018You Said,\nWe Did\u2019\n, which has been embraced by\nthe College. Nevertheless, the Union\nfeels that \u201cfurther work is still necessary to completely convince students\nthat the College takes SOLE seriously.\u201d\nFurthermore, this year the Union President and Deputy President (Education)\nwere invited to become members of the\nStrategic Education Committee, which\ndetermines overall education strategies\nacross the College, and this allows them\nto become more engaged with decision\nmaking.\nAll of these have possibly contributed\nto the improved NSS score in teaching,\nallowing Imperial to reach the national\naverage. Nevertheless, a few other recommendations could be followed to\nfurther improve this aspect. For exam-ple, whilst sta\ufb00 are required to undertake courses when they start lecturing,\nfurther training is not always compulsory and varies between departments. The\nUnion suggests that \u201cbaseline standards\nshould be enforced across College, supplemented with frequent reviews.\u201d\nAs for \u2018Assessment and Feedback\u2019\n,\nwhich is still College\u2019s weakest section,\nwith the satisfaction rates nearly 10%\nbelow the national average, ranking Imperial 143rd out of 168 HEIs, very few\nrecommendations have been followed.\nThis includes stricter deadlines to ensure prompt feedback, clearer marking\ncriteria and weighting of each piece of\ncoursework and exam, as well as mak-ingtheassignmentsrelevantratherthan\ngiving work \u2018just for the sake of it\u2019\n. However, the Union feels that ICT projects\nsuch as \u2018custom\u2019 systems, which could\nact as an alternative to Blackboard,\ncould be used to improve the feedback\nand assessment programmes. Moreover, this year Deputy President (Educa-tion) and Deputy President (Welfare)\nbecame members of Representation\n& Welfare Board, which will help to\n\u201cinform the student representatives of\nwhat is happening in higher education\nat a College and national level.\u201d\nWhen it comes to \u201cAcademic Support\u201d\n, the Union feels that this section\nhas been addressed the least regarding\nthe recommendations made last year\n\u2013 buddies, moms and dads and other\nsimilar schemes don\u2019t work well, resulting in lack of mutual academic support\nbetween di\ufb00erent year groups. Consequently there is neither a feeling of community nor academic succession, which\nare particularly invaluable for those\nwho are just starting their degree. The\nUnion suggests that the departments\norganise social events so that \u2018parents\u2019\nand \u2018children\u2019 could meet up.\nAs for personal tutors, there are different approaches within the university,\nmaking it di\ufb03cult to determine a tutor\u2019s\nresponsibilities. Furthermore, there is\nno proper feedback system to see how\nthetutorsaredoing.Thismeansthatthe\ndissatis\ufb01ed students, who are not likely\nto complain to the Senior Tutor, are\nnever spotted. Furthermore, the Union\nfeels that tutors should monitor the academic progress of their charges more\nclosely and that the meetings should be\ntimetabled and probably should take\nWith the NSS in full swing this year, Yulia Negreskul sees where\nprogress was made and not made on last year\u2019s suggestions\nUnfortunately, it has not been imple-mented. Furthermore, the Union feels\nthat ICT could be used to improve the\nrates of SOLE and NSS by pop-ups on\nCollege computers, for example, but\nthis is something still to be seen. Nevertheless, when it came to the Library\nand the Union campaign to challenge\nunfair journal pricing, the College fully\nsupported them.\nIn addition to the 35 made last year,\nthree new recommendations were\nadded and these include training of\nGraduate Teaching Assistants to improve their feedback quality as well as\n\u2018best practice\u2019 reports for each depart-ment, which re\ufb02ect on the changes\nthey\u2019ve made. Furthermore, it has been\nsuggested that the College invests more\ninto the communication with students,\nas it will help to resolve many issues\nwhere students feel out of touch with\nthe university.\nEven though most recommendations\nhaven\u2019t been fully embraced by the College, some positive changes are seen as a\nresult of these suggestions, which might\nwell have contributed to the ranking for\n2013 entry where Imperial has moved 6\npositions in comparison to the previous\nyear, making Imperial 8th.\nCollege were contacted for comment\nand replied: \u201cFeedback from Imperial\nCollege Union, both in the form of its\nNSS Response and through sabbaticals\u2019\nregular meetings with senior sta\ufb00, is always taken seriously and helps inform\nimprovements the College makes. Individual departments have prepared\naction plans focused on enhancing the\nstudent experience they o\ufb00er \u2013 including looking at elements such as teaching approaches and assessment and\nfeedback.\u201d\ntime in a less formal\nenvironment, further\nencouraging community spirit, which is that\nvalued by the NSS.\nAnother problem\nthat hasn\u2019t been addressed in the past\nyear is poor timetabling where sometimes\nstudents living across\nLondon need to come\nin only for one lecture.\nMoreover, last year the\nUnion suggested moving timetable to a different software such as\nOptime or at least making it synchronize by\ndefault with calendars\nsuch as Outlook and\niCal, to make the tracking of changes easy.

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n32 FRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\n\u201cThe great and glorious g\nJohn Park Film Editor\nOnce upon a time there was a man\nnamed Alfred Hitchcock (Hopkins)\nand he was as huge hit in Hollywood.\nMany of his pictures were critically\nacclaimed and considerable \ufb01nancial success stories, with audiences\nworldwide entertained with his suspenseful movies. The year is 1959,\nand the English director is enjoying\nthe immense hit of his latest, North\nby Northwest. Aged 60, is it time for\nhim to retire whilst he\u2019s ahead? A\nreporter asks. Never; as he is never\n\ufb01nished exploring his artistic daring.\nWith the bar set this high now, anticipation builds on what will become\nhis next project. After a long period\nof searching for something he feels is\nexactly right, he settles on the story\nbased on serial killer Ed Gein (Mi-chael Wincott), who used to skin his\nvictims. And of course, a \ufb01lm titled\nPsycho has boardroom executives\nand censors troubled with its potentially bold, o\ufb00ensive content.\n\u201cHitch\u201d (his preferred nickname:\n\u201cJust Hitch, hold the cock\u201d) has a lot\nof persuading and convincing to do\nsince everyone is appalled by the idea\nof having a vicious mother-loving serial killer roam about on the screen\nmurdering someone taking a shower.\nWill there be nudity? Hitch insists\nthere won\u2019t be. Since the actress will\nbe wearing a shower cap. The Motion Picture Production Code is neither impressed nor amused. His wife\nAlma Reville (Mirren) isn\u2019t keen on\nthe idea at \ufb01rst, but eventually warms\nto the concept, ful\ufb01lling the role of\nan ever-dutiful wife who supports her\nhusband no matter what. It\u2019s even her\nidea to have the leading lady killed o\ufb00\nin the \ufb01rst thirty minutes.\nThe next hurdle comes in trying\nto secure funding for the \ufb01lm. Paramount, his usual collaborating com-pany, respectfully declines to o\ufb00er up\nthe budget. Hitch, owning quite the\nfortune himself thanks to his previous successes, decides to self-\ufb01nance\nthe production: that\u2019s how much he\nbelieves in the screenplay. Alma is\nobviously weary of Hitch\u2019s big spend,\nbut again, supports him by having\nto cut back on their usual expenses.\nShe must also tread carefully when a\nclose friend of hers, Whit\ufb01eld Cook\n(Huston), insists on Alma having a\nread of his new script.\nNow the casting: Grace Kelly, now\nHer Serene Highness the Princess\nof Monaco, is completely o\ufb00 limits,\nmuch to Hitch\u2019s dismay. So he goes\non to Janet Leigh (Johansson), Vera\nMiles (Biel), and as for the titular Psycho role, the nervous, shy and timid\nAnthony Perkins (D\u2019Arcy) seems to\n\ufb01t the part, an excellent \ufb01nd Alma\nmanages to pick from a rather large\npile of resumes.\nSo the events leading up to the\nactual production seem interesting\nenough. We wonder just how much\nof a tough time Hitch will face, whilst\ndirecting his passion project. But\nwhen it comes to actually showing\nthe audiences the process of \ufb01lming\nPsycho, we are treated to very little\ninsight, if at all. Hitchcock is more\ninterested in what e\ufb00ects the \ufb01lming had on the relationship between\nthe director and his wife. Aside from\na brief scene that shows how the infamous \u201cshower scene\u201d came into\nexistence, we very rarely visit the\nset, let alone spend any time with\nthe actors in front of Hitch\u2019s cam-eras. Johansson, Biel and D\u2019Arcy all\nresemble their real-life counterparts\nand have a good crack at acting the\nactors\u2019 parts, but their performances\nare so brief that very little ends up of\nany use.\nThe \ufb01lm also wants to explore the\npsychology behind Hitch\u2019s attachment to the original material of the\nproduction. We are intermittently\nshown Ed Gein at various stages of\nhis life. We see Hitch visualising the\nserial killer\u2019s behaviour. Developing\nthis to strangers territories, we also\nsee Hitch conversing with his \u201cinspiration.\u201d These scenes hardly ever\nwork, since it is never really depicted\njust what lesson the director took\naway from studying his character in\nso much depth. So he makes a \ufb01lm\nthat causes impact and its fair share\nof scandals. But how he goes about\nbringing everything together is never\nclearly addressed and therefore it all\nends up looking a bit tame for its subject matter.\nBut yes, we do see the eccentric and\nquite possibly disturbingly perverted\nside of Hitch. He likes to stare at people through his window. He likes to\nstare at Vera Miles changing through\na peep-hole. He cannot take his eyes\nof Janet Leigh. And he\u2019s hardly ever\napologetic for his actions, even when\ndirectly in front of his wife. This\ndoes naturally cause some tension\nin his marriage. It\u2019s not the \ufb01rst time\nsomething like this has happened.\nThe famous Hitchcock blondes are\nthe subject of his obsessive desire it\nseems, and Alma\u2019s put up with them\nfor years. With the added pressure of\nsome tough hoops to jump through,\nit\u2019s only a matter of time until the two\nof them face o\ufb00 head-to-head.\nAnd in these iconic roles, the two\nveterans are simply outstanding.\nHopkins is full of odd qualities and\nis utterly brilliant in delivering his\nslow, deadpan, shock humour. With\nhis awkward posture and gait, he\ntruly transforms into the master of\nsuspense and there is no denying\nthat Hopkins\u2019 portrayal is a fun, endlessly watchable one. Equally brilliant\nis Mirren, who is full of commanding energy, love and wisdom as the\nbehind-the-scenes guide of her hus-band. (\u201cI celebrate with you when the\nreviews are good, I cry for you when\nthey are bad\u201d) Her frustrations are\nentirely understandable, and she very\nrarely masks her feelings. She too has\nthe tendency to speak her mind and\nMirren, who has never had a problem\nwith the dramatics, puts everything\nshe has into the more wordy scenes.\n\u201cI put up with those people who look\nthrough me as if I were invisible because all they can see is the great and\nglorious genius, Alfred Hitchcock\u201d\nsays Alma, with bitter disdain when\nHitch dares to accuse her of not supporting his work enough.\nOnce the \ufb01lm is eventually \ufb01nished\nwith the collaborative e\ufb00ort between\nthe spouses, the result is an unexpected one, and despite the hurdles,\nHitchcock has once again directed\na classic that shocks us even to this\nday. His legacy lives on, and for good\nreason. And here is a \ufb01lm that tells us\nhe had undying encouragement and\nhelp from perhaps the most important woman in his life. \u201cI will never\n\ufb01nd a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful\nas you,\u201d says he, \u201cOh, Hitch. I\u2019ve waited thirty years to hear you say that.\u201d\n\u201cThat, my dear, is why they call me\nthe Master of Suspense.\u201d How sweet.\nHitchcock\nDirector: Sacha Gervasi\nScreenwriters: John J. McLaughlin,\nStephen Rebello (book)\nStarring: Anthony Hopkins, Helen\nMirren, Danny Huston, Scarlett\nJohansson, Jessica Biel, James D\u2019Arcy\nWhen a hall senior tries to have sex with you...\nWhat on Earth is that around her neck?\n\n"

Tahrir Square was\nonce again \ufb01lled with protesters, their\nanger now directed at the current\nelected President Mohamed Morsi,\nand the police who are accused of excessive violence in a series of clashes\nin recent months. Two years on, Egypt\nstill seems to be on a precipice.\nAs police released tear gas across\ncentral Cairo, and concentrations in\nTahrir Square approached \u201cdangerous\nlevels\u201d, thousands of protesters\nremained on the streets in open\nde\ufb01ance of a curfew imposed by Morsi\nacross three provinces following a\nseries of fatal clashes with protesters\nand police. The words of the people on\nthe streets echoed the cries of 2011,\naccusing Morsi\u2019s government of being\n\u201cexactly the same as the Mubarak\ngang\u201d, and of trying to establish a\n\u2018theocratic dictatorship\u2019.\nIn fact, Tahrir Square has hardly\nstoodemptythese24months.Protests\ncontinued through the \ufb01rst half of last\nyear against the interim \u201cSupreme\nCouncil of the Armed Forces\u2019\nestablished in the wake of Mubarak\u2019s\nfall, who were seen as dominated by\n\ufb01gures of the old regime and accused\nof delaying over democratic elections.\nWhen the polls \ufb01nally opened, it was\nhoped that the democratic election\nof Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim\nBrotherhood would see the country\ncontinue along the path to reform.\nBut the Egyptian people remain\nin the streets, concerned that Morsi\nis balking at the prospect of reform,\nor even trying to secure power for\nthe Islamist Muslim Brotherhood.\nTensions \ufb02ared when, while drafting\nthe country\u2019s new constitution, many\nparties walked out of the negotiation\nprocess, claiming that the current\ndocument too heavily favoured the\nMuslim Brotherhood. Morsi followed\nby giving himself the power to push\nthe draft constitution to a vote and,\nin the face of public protest, awarded\narrest power to the military to provide\nsecurity for a referendum. The\nconstitution passed, but continues to\nbe criticised for the level of judicial\npower it passes to Egypt\u2019s upper\nparliamentary house, the Shura,\nwhich is predominantly controlled by\nthe Muslim Brotherhood.\nMany who voted yes in that\nreferendum did so hoping that it\nwould bring much needed stability.\nHowever, the fallout of another\ntragedy, just over a year ago, brought\nthe people and the police back into\nconfrontation. The death of some 70\nAl-Ahly club supporters at a match\nt has been just over two\nyears since a street vendor\nin Tunisia set himself on \ufb01re.\nHis act of protest against\nthe country\u2019s oppressive and\ncorrupt regime was not extinguished:\nthe protest resonated with citizens\nacross the Arab world, engul\ufb01ng the\nregion in political demonstrations,\nrevolutions and even civil war.\nA lot can change in two years.\nSyria is embroiled in a civil war,\nwhich is already being viewed\nby some as a proxy war between\nregional and global powers. Al-Assad,\nSyria\u2019s embattled ruler, is supported\ndiplomatically by Russia, as well as\nby Iranian arms. The rebels enjoy\nrecognition from many global powers,\nsuch as the US, Britain and France, as\nwell as alleged military aid from the\nGulf States.\nIn the meantime the death toll runs\nat about 60,000.\nBut Syria\u2019s importance does not lie\nin the compounding humanitarian\ncatastrophe. Rather, the war-torn\nnation can be viewed as part of a\ngreater regional struggle, between the\nrising star of Iran and the Gulf States.\nIraq similarly proved to be a staging\nground between the two power blocs.\nThis comes at an unsettling time:\nthe Iranian military is one of the\nlargest and strongest in the region\nand the unresolved issue of its nuclear\nambition hangs in the air. The Gulf\nStates, on the other hand, have been\nspending billions on modernising\ntheir military force. Open con\ufb02ict\nbetween these regional players would\nbe devastating. But the equal military\nstrength of both powers\u2019 blocs could\ngo a long way to stabilizing the region.\nSyria will certainly be the bellwether\nfor this struggle.\nIn the other corner of the Arab\nworld, another con\ufb02ict is blazing.\nMali\u2019s breakaway region of Azawad\ncould potentially become a safe haven\nfor terrorists. Needless to say, this\nwould further destabilise a precarious\nregion, where random acts of violence\nare already too common. Last week, a\ngas plant was attacked by Al Qaedaa\ufb03liated Islamists in northern Algeria,\nleading to the deaths of 37 foreigners.\nThe international community has\nbeen quick to respond to the crisis,\nsending troops, military hardware\nand intelligence to Mali from all over\nthe world. The operation so far has\nbeen a success, with a joint French\nand African force pushing deep into\nAzawad, taking over the last rebel\nstronghold in Kidal.\nBut recapturing lost territory will\nnot solve Mali\u2019s problem. Libya is\nthe key factor in the equation. When\nMuammar Gadda\ufb01 was toppled in\nthe early days of the Arab Spring, the\ncountry stabilised enough to hold\ndemocratic elections. While these\nproved largely peaceful and legitimate,\nthe nation still has yet to deal with the\narmed militias that control swathes of\nland. Also of concern are the largely\nuncontrolled borders of Libya. When\nIslamists declared sharia law in\nAzawad, militants and arms \ufb02owed\nalmost unimpeded from Libya. As\nsuch, secured borders will prove to be\nan asset to stabilising the region.\nThe Arab Spring hasn\u2019t all been\nabout war. Dictators weren\u2019t the\nonly ones that suddenly went up in\nsmoke. Stagnant governments and\nbureaucracies soon felt the heat. The\npeople demanded more rights, more\ntransparency and more democratic\ninstitutions. And while political\nchanges have been taking place from\nMorocco to Oman, Egypt has proven\nto be of particular interest.\nThe most populous nation of\nthe Arab world, Egypt has been\nplagued with problems following the\noverthrow of Hosni Mubarak. Morsi,\nthe current President, managed to\nwrestle control from the armed forces,\nin Port Said was such an order of\nmagnitude above any previous\nfootball violence that it led many\nto accuse the SCAF of attacking the\nclub for its role in the 2011 uprising,\nand when residents of Port Said were\nsentenced for their role in the disaster\nit sparked mass civil unrest.\nThis string of events, culminating in\nthe deaths of 40 Port Said citizens at\npolice hands, are why Egypt is once\nagain gripped by protest. Reports of\npolice violence are multitudinous,\nand the parallels with Mubarak\u2019s\nown police crackdown in the face\nof public revolt are not lost on the\npeople of Egypt. The government has\npledged reform, and apologised for\nthe strikingly public police assault\nof Hammad Saber, which sets it\ndistinctly apart from the ways of the\nold regime. But Egypt remains in\nlimbo, struggling on with its troubled\ntransition from years of autocracy.\npreventing the formation of a military\ndictatorship that seemed inevitable.\nEgypt is not through the woods yet,\nhowever: alongside economic woes,\na bill that e\ufb00ectively gives Morsi\nunchecked power has been the subject\nof current unrest. It seems that Egypt\nstill has a di\ufb03cult path to political\nfreedom and stability.\nThe Arab Spring has been a mixed\nblessing. War and freedom blossomed\nin the wake of dictators. Political leaps\nforward have been just as common\nas a rising death toll. But no matter\nthe consequences one thing remains\nclear: the Arab world has woken up.\nAP/Khalil Hamra\nAP\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough being short.\nPoor Sarko.\u201d Hollande,\nMali, 3rd February 2013\nHappy Birthday from Cairo\n\n"

You worked hard\nand you got the grades.\nThe world is your metaphorical oyster. With\nyour hard earned piece of paper you\ncan do whatever your heart desires.\nSo why do nearly a third of us end up\nworking in the \ufb01nancial services?\nWith banks as public enemy number one, the City is facing a crisis.\nNew regulation promises to limit\nrisky casino banking and with it\nthe large pro\ufb01ts and bonuses they\nbrought are likely to disappear. So is\n\ufb01nance a dream job to aspire to or do\nImperial students just lack imagina-tion? Let\u2019s meet one of them.\n\u201cHello Lance. I hear you want to be\na banker.\u201d \u201cYes, it\u2019s the best job and\nI want to be the best,\u201d replies Lance.\n\u201cWhy do you think it\u2019s the best?\u201d\n\u201cWell it pays the most.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019ll\nbe very time-poor.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll\nonly do it for \ufb01ve years, become rich,\nthen leave.\u201d\nThis is a conversation we\u2019ve all heard\na hundred times before. It sounds rea-sonable, but does Lance\u2019s viewpoint\nactually stand up to scrutiny? Let\u2019s\nlook at a real-life example. A 2008\nMaths graduate got a job working in\nMergers & Acquisitions for Goldman\nSachs \u2013 this is basically Lance\u2019s dream\njob. His starting salary was \u00a335,000\nand he would usually clock around 85\nhours a week. This works out to \u00a37.90\nper hour, which is actually below the\nLondon Living Wage. So Lance would\nbe \ufb01nancially better o\ufb00 if he were to\nspend those hours cleaning the of\ufb01ce rather than playing with spread-sheets. It\u2019s true that Lance\u2019s salary\nprogression is better than your average cleaner\u2019s, so one day he\u2019ll outdo\nDorris. But it\u2019s ludicrous to think you\ncan make a life-changing amount of\nmoney in your \ufb01rst \ufb01ve years.\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d pipes up Lance, \u201cI\u2019ll\ndo it for ten years then.\u201d \u201cWell Lance,\n\ufb01rstly, I\u2019m glad that your life plan is\nso well thought-out that a ten second\ncalculation can throw it o\ufb00 course.\nBut if you want to make serious money you\u2019re going to need to climb the\ncorporate ladder.\u201d \u201cSo how do I do\nthat? Be the best at my job?\u201d \u201cSilly\nLance, these jobs could be done by a\nfour year old. You\u2019ll never stand out\nthat way. If you want to progress you\nneed to brand yourself a winner, and\nthat\u2019s an expensive business. There\u2019s\nno living like a student anymore. To\nact the part you need the expensive\nsuit, Omega watch and to be blowing\nyour money on nights out in Mayfair.\nIf the team jets o\ufb00 to Monaco for the\nweekend, then that\u2019s what you do too\nwhether or not you can actually afford it. Managing relationships (read:\nY\nThe City life ain\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be, warns Adam Billing\nsucking up) is key in this industry and\nyou need to do your part, otherwise\nthat next promotion won\u2019t be coming\nyour way. Unfortunately, with all this\nspending it\u2019s going to be di\ufb03cult for\nyou to amass that fortune you were\ntalking about.\u201d\nWhy is Lance so keen for cash? I\u2019m\nnot entirely sure he knows. But let\u2019s\nget one thing straight: money is not a\nreason in itself. No one actually wants\na pile of cash. What Lance is after are\nthe things that money can bring: \ufb01nancial freedom, lifestyle, a big house\n(status) and a fast car (penis exten-sion). So is a City career the best way\nto achieve these things?\nI have a confession to make: I was\nonce a Lance. I went o\ufb00 to the City\nto seek my fortune, but instead this is\nwhat I found.\nFinancial freedom: because of the\npressures to \u201clive the lifestyle\u201d my\ncolleagues were the most indebted individuals I have ever met. There were\npeople on \u00a3300,000 salaries that were\n\u201cleveraged\u201d ten times their earnings \u2013\ni.e. they owed the bank three million\nquid! Losing your job with that much\ndebt means immediate and de\ufb01nite\n\ufb01nancial ruin. In fact, most were\nscrewed if they didn\u2019t get the right\nbonus. This is as far from \ufb01nancial\nfreedom as I can imagine.\nFar from being an isolated incident,\nmassive leveraging is rife. It\u2019s fuelled\nby the belief that you\u2019re top dog; you\u2019ll\nbe richer next year so why worry\nabout today. This short sighted thinking can leave you trapped in a job\nyou have tired of and leads to bodies\nlittering the pavements of St. Paul\u2019s\nwhen \ufb01nancial crises break.\nMany enter the City with the belief\nthat they\u2019ll do it di\ufb00erently. Unfortunately, The Square Mile is a tribal\nplace. If you\u2019re not with them, you\u2019re\nagainst them. If you don\u2019t take part\nin the lifestyle, part of which is living\nabove your means, then you\u2019re implicitly critical of those who do \u2013 which\nis everyone. People will mistrust you\nand you won\u2019t form the relationships\nyou need to be successful.\nLifestyle: You\u2019re never going to become Roman Abramovich by being a\nbanker. It\u2019s a well-paid job but it\u2019s still\njust a job and selling your labour is\nnot a scalable business model. However, there\u2019s no denying that bankers\nare generally wealthy. So what do they\ndo with all that money? What experiences do they have, that we mere\nmortals can only dream of? Well as\nfar as I could tell, their experiences\nweren\u2019t that dissimilar to my own:\nthey lived in a house, drove a car, occasionally went to restaurants and\nwould go on holiday once or twice a\nyear. The di\ufb00erence was they would\nspend a lot more money doing these\nthings.\nIf they went on holiday it had to\nbe somewhere with \u2018service.\u2019 I mean\nwhat\u2019s the point in money if you can\u2019t\nmake plebs do things for you? The car\nhas to be new and replaced frequent-ly. My boss even paid \u00a3800 to have\nhis Range Rover resprayed because\na cat walked across the bonnet. The\nmain goal of these excessive expenditures seems to be so you can talk\nabout them loudly in the o\ufb03ce. So I\ndon\u2019t think it was appreciated when I\nsuggested that a \u00a35.99 bottle of T-Cut\nwould have done the same job.\nStatus: It might impress your mum\nbut is it really a high status job? Status is in the eye of the beholder. So if\nyour aim in life is to impress Mayfair\nairheads then congratulations, you\u2019ve\nfound your calling. But they don\u2019t understand what it is you actually do.\nThe truth is, depending on your job\ntitle, you\u2019re somewhere between an\nExcel monkey and a PowerPoint mon-key; you\u2019re doing a job that doesn\u2019t\nchallenge you and whose only social\nworth is to make rich people richer.\nSo whom are you looking to impress?\nAnd is it worth it?\nEveryone has di\ufb00erent aspirations\nin life and it\u2019s not for me to tell you\nhow to live yours. However, the Imperial view of the City is far from the\nreality I encountered. Hopefully a few\nmore people sharing their experiences might counter the multi-million\npound propaganda machine that we\nare fed in College.\nBut for those still determined to follow in Lance\u2019s footsteps, a \ufb01nal word.\nWe don\u2019t live in the 80s anymore. The\nmantra of \u201cgreed is good\u201d has failed\nand there is a deep mistrust of the\ncomplex \ufb01nancial instruments that\nImperial students were employed to\ndeal with. In the coming years the\nCity will face heavy regulation, and\nwith it the in\ufb02ated pro\ufb01ts and bonuses they produced will vanish. Sure it\nwon\u2019t happen overnight, but why get\non a sinking ship?\nThere are more career options than\n\ufb01nance, a PhD or teaching: change\nthe world with an NGO; join the cyber war by breaking codes at GCHQ;\nor be the next David Attenborough.\nScience and technology are the future of our economy so why not join\na start-up, or better yet, create your\nown. Your 20s are when you are most\nfree to take risks, don\u2019t waste them on\na grad scheme making tea for Lance.\nThis shortsighted\nthinking can\nleave you\ntrapped in a\njob you have\ntired of.\nNo matter how hard you try, you\nwill never be as cool as this man\n\n"

    "content": "GAMES\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY 37\nGames Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAs a physicist there is something about\nmaking particles swirl round and making pretty pictures from the results\nwhich I totally get deep down inside my\nsoul. Auditorium HD is a game about\ndirecting a stream of coloured particles\ninto audio containers. These audio containers light up when su\ufb03cient particles of the correct colour touch them,\nadding a new instrument or phrase\ninto the mix progressively unlocking\nwhat are often beautifully atmospheric\ntracks. To achieve this each level gives\nyou a wide variety of tools, including\nsplitters, black holes, coloured bubbles\nthat change the colour of particles and\naccelerators amongst others.\nThe \ufb01rst thing you notice is the incredible start up loading time. It takes\nat least 5 minutes to get into game\nfrom PS3 on to swirling them beams.\nThis is far too long for a puzzle game,\na genre best suited to 5-10 minute\nbursts when you have nothing else to\ndo. Everything else from there on out\nis instantaneous, which evens out over\na long play session where the initial\nloading time isn\u2019t 50% of the time you\nhave to play it.\nAuditorium \ufb01rst saw the light as a\n\ufb02ash-based game on the PC before\nmoving on to great success as an iOS\ngame. Soon after it was ported to PS3\nas Auditorium HD and this is the version I am reviewing. Whilst I think the\nfundamentals of a puzzler of this type\nare more suited to iOS the PS3 version\ndoes have some de\ufb01nite positives.\nDual analog control allows precise\nlocation movements and concurrent\nresizing of the tools, this would be dif\ufb01cult to do both at once in a precise\nmanner by touch or mouse. I can also\nimagine getting the various pieces in\nthe perfect position to be much more\ndi\ufb03cult when your thumb is obscuring a signi\ufb01cant portion of the screen,\nespecially as some of the harder levels\nrequire pixel-level precision.\nMost of the time, Auditorium is successful at invoking that \u2018I am such a genius!\u2019 level of elation that the best puzzle games are capable of summoning.\nSadly, some of the harder levels can\ndissolve into a tedious trial and error\nprocess: changing the location and size\nof each component by a pixel at a time\nto ensure the beam goes in exactly\nthe right direction. I found the swirly-attractor tools were the worst for this.\nMy tactics with these quickly become\n\u2018make it bigger to catch more and hope\nthe resulting mad swirl touches the\nright things\u2019. And if that failed I moved\nit a pixel to the right. They look good in\naction though.\nThe music is a core part of the game\n(wouldn\u2019t have guessed by the name)\nand it is generally fantastic in an atmospheric kind of way. The \u2018Classic\u2019 tracks are often a twinkly piano\nand accompanying violin producing\nan almost melancholic feeling. The\nLouis Gall Risk Jockey\nI feared this would happen. It was\nforetold by an ancient Mayan calen-dar, and Nostradamus mentioned it\nsomewhere. It\u2019s a simulator game that\nI like, and won\u2019t take the mickey out\nof. Much.\nFrom the studio that brought us\nEuro Truck Simulator (numbers 1 and\n2), Trucks & Trailers has you in the\nshoes of a trucker. Your job: to navigate your way through loading depots,\nvarious car parks and rest stops. It\u2019s\nnowhere near as easy as I thought it\nwould be. Why? You have no control\nover the trailer you\u2019re hauling around\nthe place. This suddenly makes the\ngame interesting, when reversing your\ntruck doesn\u2019t do what you want it to.\nDon\u2019t let me get started on parallel\nparking either.\nThere\u2019s a smorgasbord of missions,\nand you can get 4 rankings \u2013 gold, sil-ver, bronze, and completed for each\none. You can only get a medal if you\n\ufb01nish the mission without your cab or\ntrailer hitting anything, however. As\nper usual, the shininess of your medal\nis dictated by the swiftness of your\nparking.\nEverything seems simple, but then\nyou\u2019ve got to navigate the other vehi-cles/obstacles in the area, as well as\ntake the actual size of the compound\n\u2018Modern\u2019 songs display greater vari-ety, though sometimes it can feel like\nthey just replaced the piano with a\nkeyboard and the violins with a synth.\nEach piece is broken up into 4-7 levels;\neach level forms a movement of the\noverall track until you have unlocked\nthe entire song.\nHowever there is quite a jarring\nproblem lurking beneath this level\nstructure. Namely, when you get stuck\non a level and are unable to light up\nthat last phrase to complete a piece.\nThe resulting ten minute looping of a\nhalf-complete song can become very\nannoying. These di\ufb03culty spikes come\nout of nowhere too, as the game is not\na progression but isolated individual\ntracks, though generally these go from\neasy to hard through their own levels.\nLoud and clear: Auditorium HD\nKeep rollin\u2019 rollin\u2019 rollin\u2019\nRoss Webster Bad mother-trucker into account. The controls are great,\nand unlike other driving simulators I\ncan mention (I\u2019m looking at you, Bus\nand Cable Car Simulator: San Francisco) not every button on your keyboard\ndoes something. For example, I\u2019m not\ngoing to be driving along and then accidentally open the doors on the side\nof the bus, and spill my \ufb02eshy contents\nonto the sidewalk (American game,\nAmerican lingo). The worst I can end\nup doing is unlocking the trailer and\nhaving it slide along the ground, ready\nfor me to pick it up again.\nThere are a couple of things that I\nthink are a bit of a shame \u2013 you start\nthe game with all the trucks/cabins\nunlocked. I feel that there should be\nsomething to work towards \u2013 I\u2019m still\ngoing to be wasting my time trying to\nget the gold medals on everything, but\nwhy not be rewarded by more trucks\n(or maybe decals and extras. I wanna\npimp up my cabin with a Hello Kitty\nsprayed on the side, and a little wobbling hula-girl on my dashboard)?\nGraphics-wise, the game looks \ufb01ne\nfor a year-and-a-bit old game, and the\naudio\u2019s rather simple but realistic (not\nthat I\u2019d expect much else from a driving sim). I managed to crank video settings up to their max, keeping a steady\nframe rate, so no worries there.\nA solid buy, if you\u2019re into... haulage..\nUrge to shoot large\ntanker... increasing...\nI\u2019d like to see the Large\nHadron Collider do this!\nPromising screenshot of the week\nThe DayZ Stand(s)alone\nThat\u2019s right! We\u2019ve now seen footage of the DayZ standalone, and some of the\ngreat work that\u2019s gone into it \u2013 proper scavenging for loot, swampy areas of\nChernarus, clothes that aren\u2019t just onesies, and real clouds... Unsurprisingly,\nthis video stoked the fandom for the game, and prodded at that sore bit, left\nover from the chafing departure of WarZ.\nGot a screenshot of your CoD scoreboard after a killing spree?

After winning 3rd place in the\n2012 tournament and a dedicated\nstart to year for the Imperial Eagles\nhandball club, with weeks of intense\nrecruiting and months of training,\nthis tournament was due to show us\njust how we compare to the rest of\nthe UK\u2019s university enthusiasts in this\npopular European sport.\nThe tournament promised to be\nthe biggest UK tournament so far\nwith over 600 players from universities across the UK entering 60 teams\nto compete for the much coveted 1st\nplace trophy. Imperial entered three\nteams ,including a womens\u2019 side, and\nwith this year\u2019s tournament being\nheld in the Mayesbrook Park training\ncourts in East London where handball\nathletes from across the world trained\nfor last year\u2019s Olympics, even the location held the promise of inspiring\nvictories for the Eagles.\nThe \ufb01rst day\u2019s play showed a more\nthan promising start to the tournament for Imperial Men\u2019s I, with a victory against every team played, putting them at the top of their group\nand easily helping them to qualify for\na place in the quarter-\ufb01nals. Sadly, the\nImperial Men\u2019s II and Women\u2019s did\nnot fair quite so well in the competi-tion. Due to a lack of players the Men\u2019s\nII had to forfeit the entire second day\nof play and despite a surprising victory against Bedford whilst one player\ndown, Imperial Women did not qualify for a place in the Women\u2019s quarter\ufb01nals.\nThe height of excitement for the Imperial Eagles Handball Club was seen\nin the second day of play during the\nImperial Men\u2019s quarter-\ufb01nal match\nagainst sports university side Loughborough. With a relentless assault of\ngoals by star shooter Lucas Carstens,\na solid defence most notably held up\nby club president Yannick Seis and an\nexceptional level of precision, speed\nand execution of team strategy, Imperial illustrated exactly what kind\nof side they can be and breezed into\ntheir semi-\ufb01nal match against Oxford.\nTowards the end of the second day\nof play however, with energy and concentration levels running low the side\n\ufb01nally began to come undone and lost\ntheir semi-\ufb01nal match, a painful turn\nof events made even more frustrating by a win against this very same\nICURFC 3rd XV going uphill against\nSt. George\u2019s\nAfter a chequered \ufb01rst term for Imperial College 3rd XV and a great performance resulting in a disappointing\ndraw against King\u2019s Medics three\nweeks ago the social side of ICURFC\nwanted to show what they are capable\nof and bring home the \ufb01rst win this\nterm. A promising squad featuring\n\ufb01ve new 3rd team players made their\nway to Wimbledon RFC this Wednesday to face the challenge against St.\nGeorge\u2019s 2nd XV were a pitch that\ncould have been used as a skiing piste\nover the last weeks rather than for a\ngame of rugby welcomed them.\nKnowing the importance of the\ngame new coach James Hayward\nled the team through a professional\nwarm-up integrating the new players and preparing them for a physical\ngame. The team seemed to be in good\nshape and was switched on from the\nstart raising hopes for the game.\nAlex Leonard kicked o\ufb00 and Imperial chased downhill making\nthe \ufb01rst big tackles that would be\nneeded throughout the game. From\nthe start the 3rd XV were dominating the game hardly playing in their\nown half, pushing for the opposing\ntry line. However, St. George\u2019s defence was tight and the conditions\nmade it almost impossible to get the\nball wide. At least Jean Casademont,\ninside-centre and Frenchman, claims\nthat this was the reason rather than\nthe fading trust in his nation\u2019s skills.\n25 min in the good work by the\nforwards pushing hard against the\nopposition led to what IC thought\nwas their \ufb01rst try. Unfortunately the\nreferee, being a bit too slow to follow Will Gri\ufb03ths quick touch down,\ndidn\u2019t award it and left the team\ndisappointed. This unrighteousness\nonly made IC work harder and \ufb01ve\nminutes later \ufb02yhalf Alex Leonard\ntwisted himself through St. George\u2019s\ndefence like a ballet dancer completing a full pirouette before putting the\nball on the ground. He did not show\nthe same elegance but his skills on\nthe conversion, managing to put IC\n0-7 ahead after slipping on the kick.\nWith the con\ufb01dence gained the ball\neven made it out to the wing, something rarely seen at 3rd XV perfor-mances, where Will Cathery showed\ngood runs and chips in his rugby union debut for Imperial College. Alas,\nthe \ufb01rst half ended with prop, Alexander Karvelas, coming o\ufb00 injured\nand Edoardo Cavallazi, interim captain and learned \ufb02anker stepping up\nto \ufb01ll the gap.\nImperial came back onto the pitch\nhighly motivated, knowing that they\nwould have to keep up the hard work\nto control their opposition especially\nas they were playing uphill now. The\n\ufb01rst 20 minutes of the second half\nwere even with Imperial gaining territory but losing the ball in scrums\nand lineouts. Especially after Hugh\nMacKinnon had to come o\ufb00 and\nImperial was left with a \ufb02anker and\nnumber 8 instead of two props St.\nGeorge\u2019s could have been dangerous.\nLuckily the team managed to keep up\nthe intensity and their centre did not\nseem too keen to actually pass the\nball. His bright ginger hair made him\neasy to spot and the backs stopped\nhim before he could get anywhere\nclose to the touch line.\nWith 15 minutes to go Imperial\nwere the team in much better shape.\nRob Searle and Tim Harrington making good runs on their debut, forcing\nthe opposition to give away penalty\nafter penalty bringing the 3s close to\nthe try line once again. Continuous\no\ufb00enses by St. George\u2019s forwards resulted in a well-deserved yellow card\nfor their \ufb02anker leaving them with\none man down fur a crucial phase of\nthe game. A phase in which Imperial\nprobably wanted to push for a try instead of taking the penalty kick to try\nand go 10-0 up... Especially as they\nmissed the kick. Although there were\nonly ten minutes left on the clock St.\nGeorge\u2019s spirit was not broken and\nthey managed to turn the ball over\ninside their \ufb01ve meter zone and bring\nit close to Imperial\u2019s try-line within\na few minutes. A few unlucky plays\nincluding scrumhalf Luke Armitage\nshowing his skills, kicking the ball\nbackwards (instead of taking it into\ncontact himself as usual) eventually\nresulted in a scrum for St. George\u2019s\nthree meters away from the try-zone.\nWith only one actual front row player\nleft Imperial was pushed over the line\nand the try in the 76 minute was inev-itable. Fortunately, those \ufb01ve points\nfrom the try were all they scored that\nWednesday as the kick did not even\nget close to the posts. Imperial managed to keep the ball for the last few\nminutes of the game and celebrated a\nhard-fought 5-7 win.\nConsidering the 0-24 loss in Harlington in the \ufb01rst leg this is an excellent result for Imperial College\n3rd XV and with two games against\nsimilar opponents left this could be\nthe start of a winning streak. Especially the win of St. George\u2019s against\nthe Imperial Medics 3rd XV last week\nleaves ICURFC con\ufb01dent for varsity.\nICURFC 3rd XV win uphill against St Georges\nHigh hopes for Handball at Champs\nRed Elmadi Sports Writer\n3rd TeamCaptain\nLukas Michalitsch\nside in the group stages. At the peak\nof frustrations during this disappointing match, when the 4th of 4 penalties\nhad been missed by one of our shoot-ers, the Men\u2019s I goal keeper was overheard to say that if he\u2019d started shooting they may have more of a chance at\nscoring, a comment followed up with\na \ufb02urry of colourful language from all\nplayers. Despite tempers running high\nat this stage a level of calm was reinstated with a serious team pep-talk\nwhich provided the side with the focus required to defeat the \u201cNorwegian\nArmy\u201d AECC and take third place\nin the overall running.

And how can you learn\nmore about the situation in Syria?\nEverything can be answered by\ntwo simple words: Action Syria.\nAction Syria is a student lead\ninitiative, backed by the Union at\nImperial to raise awareness and\nhumanise the civil unrest in Syria.\nThe organisers want to demonstrate solidarity and express that\nSyria is being remembered by\nImperial College. The campaign\nruns from the 1st to the 22nd\nFebruary. Detailed information\nis outlined on the website www.\nactionsyria.com. The website is\npacked with information, so make\nsure you visit it. The crisis in Syria\nwas bought about by a few simple\nwords. Do you know what they\nare? (Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t as\nthey\u2019re on the website). There will\nalso be a lecture by experts on the\nhumanitarian crisis on the 12th of\nFebruary so keep your eyes wide\nopen for that, it is one not to be\nmissed. Additionally, there is a full\ntimeline of events explaining what\nhas happened over the last two\nyears. Syria is a war-torn country,\nwhere hundreds die every day;\nthis campaign is a great way for\nyoutohelpmakeadifference(and\nwasn\u2019t that one of your New Year\nresolutions?).\nThe website also has a link to the\nAvaaz petition, the one that wants\nthe Syrian Students to be able to\ncontinue with their studies in the\nUK. So if you want to help out,\nplease sign it.\nThe organisers succinctly explained the motivation for this\ncampaign, \u201cwe want to actively\nportray that \u2018we have not forgotten\u2019, the website and social media\nis a way of raising awareness and\nto humanise what can so easily\nbecome statistic after statistic. It\u2019s\na campaign which also aims to\nraise funds for medicine, provide\norganised information about the\nsituation and enables everyone to\nhelp out in any way possible.\u201d\nThere is also a Facebook page\nthat gives daily updates: https://\nwww.facebook.com/ActionSyria.\nWhether or not you are a tweeter,\nbe sure to check out #ActionSyria.\nSo get informed and get involved.\nNida Mahmud\nNews Editor\nAction Syria\nThe government has been urged\nto show clemency and help Syrian\nstudents who are at the risk of being ejected from their university and\ndeported from the UK. There are\napproximately 670 Syrian students\nstudying in the UK, approximately\n80% are on postgraduate courses. The\nlack of funding means they face being\nremoved from their courses. Mansour\nShaeban, a former Computing student\nat Bolton was expelled last for not being able to receive money from his\nfamily to pay tuition. Many of these\nstudents were funded by Syria\u2019s higher\neducation ministry, which has ceased\nawarding grants. Other students have\nhad their fees suspended for standing\nagainst the Syrian regime. The Syrian\nembassy in London processes the pay-ments, but it has come to a halt, being\nleft with just a skeleton of sta\ufb00; fur-thermore, international sanctions are\nin place on the country\u2019s banks. Consequently, self-funded students are\nunable to receive money from their\nfamily in Syria.\nLast October, the UK Borders Agency announced temporary concessions\nfor Syrian nationals, enabling visa\nextensions or the switching of visa\ncategories without leaving the UK;\nhowever, this is yet to be addressed\nas these concessions will expire on 15\nMarch. Many students currently face\nan uncertain future; some have had\ntheir student status suspended, while\nothers will not be able to graduate till\ntheir fees have been paid. Without\nfunding, many students are struggling\nto make ends meet for their living\ncosts.\nLiam Burns, President of the NUS,\ncommented: \u201cThe situation in Syria\nis devastating enough without universities turning their backs on those\ncurrently studying in the UK. What\nwe urgently need to see is every Syrian student is given support when \ufb01nances aren\u2019t forthcoming so they can\ncontinue their studies. This has to be\nthe least the UK can do considering\nthe tragic circumstances of the con\ufb02ict in Syria.\u201d\nImperial College London currently\nhas ten students who have Syria listed as their primary citizenship. The\nInternational O\ufb03ce said that no students have approached them about\nthe situation at this time.\nWhen asked about what the College\nwould do to help students, a College\nspokesperson said: \u201cAny student who\nexperiences an unexpected change in\ntheir \ufb01nancial circumstances, including tuition fees, can contact the Student Hub, the College Tutors or the\nUnion\u2019s Student Advice Centre for\ninformation and advice. The College\nHardship Fund is also available to help\nstudents experiencing unexpected\n\ufb01nancial hardship. The Fund cannot\nbe used to assist\nwith tuition fee\npayment but can\nhelp with living\ncosts. Students\ncan \ufb01nd further\ninformation by\nvisitinghttp://\nwww3.imperial.\nac.uk/studentfi-nance/current-students/hard-shipfund .\u201d\nAvaaz, an online pressure\ngroup, have set\nup a petition\ndemanding the\nForeign O\ufb03ce\nassist Syrian\nstudents, as was\ndone in 2011 for\nthe Libyan students during the\nLibyan revolu-tion. The petition currently\nhas over 46,000\ns i g n a t u r e s .\nAvazz is appealing for the government ministers to step in: William\nHague, the Foreign Secretary; Vince\nCable, Minister for Business, Innovation and Skills; and David Willetts,\nUniversities Minister, to ensure the\nSyrian students continue their studies in the UK. They have tracked many\nstudents who have been expelled from\ntheir courses, while there are others\nthat could be expelled as they are unable to pay their fees. When removed\nfrom their courses, they run into dif\ufb01culties with their visas and face deportation to war areas. If they have\nany connections to the opposition,\nthey will be arrested on their return.\nLuis Morago, the campaign director for Avaaz, commented: \u201cThe UK\nbeats the drum for action on Syria\nbut has done little to help hundreds\nof Syrian students in Britain who face\nbeing thrown o\ufb00 their courses. The\nUK government must intervene and\nensure they can continue their studies\nin Britain.\u201d\nTwo weeks ago a statement was released from David Willetts, the universities minister, in association with\nthe FCO and Treasury; he said that the\ngovernment is working with the Universities UK Higher Education International Unit to identify ways to assist\nstudents. He said: \u201cThe government\nappreciates the potential challenges\nfaced by students living in the UK who\nwish to receive money from countries\nthat are subject to \ufb01nancial sanctions\nand looks favourably on licence applications to enable the \ufb01nancing of edu-cation. All applications are considered\non a case by case basis and nationality\nis not a factor in any licensing deci-sion. Syrian students within the UK\nwishing to receive money from or via a\ndesignated Syrian entity should apply\nto the Treasury by email for a licence,\nsetting out the amount and purpose of\nthe transaction as well as the individu-als, organisations and banks involved.\u201d\nThe British Council has set up a\nhardship fund to support the living\ncosts to fund the 100 Syrian scholars\nwho are studying in the UK on the\nmain Syrian government scholarship.\nCertain universities are allowing the\ndeferral of fees and providing support through hardship funds, allowing\nstudents to continue with their study.\nThe Council for Assisting refugee\nAcademics has been providing help to\nacademics in danger for 80 years, has\nalso launched an appeal to help academics facing hardship.\nChristian Gilmore, a campaigner for\nthe Syrian students, said \u201cit is in the\ninterest of the British government to\nhelp these people and to follow up in\nits commitment. They may not be able\nto solve the international problem\nright now but helping Syrian students\nis 100% in their control.\nHusam Helmi, 32, who is \ufb01nishing his PhD in economics at London Brunel University, said he had\nto take odd jobs to care for his wife\nand daughter. Between study, unpaid\nuniversity fees and the news from his\nhome in Dareia, near Damascus in\nSyria, he said the pressure, was unre-lenting. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling,\u201d Mr Helmi\nsaid. \u201cWe are struggling with more\nthan one problem. They want us to\nsolve our own problems, but to \ufb01nd\na job, \ufb01nish our studies and deal with\nour emotional situation is very di\ufb03cult\u201d.\n\n"

Evans\u2019 inspiration came from James Merrill\u2019s\npoem The Changing Light at Sandover,\nwhich was composed from messages\ntransmitted during s\u00e9ances, and this\notherworldliness is re\ufb02ected in the\npiece; the oscillation of light hints at\na kind of breathing, the heat radiated\nby the strip lights reminds one of body\nwarmth.\nOne of the most spectacular works\nin the exhibition, You and I, Horizontal\nby Anthony McCall, manages to do the\nimpossible: it turns light into a tangible\nentity. A projector screens slowly moving lines onto a wall, and arti\ufb01cial mist\ntransforms this into a complex series of\nwalls of light. Viewers pass through the\npiece, becoming enveloped by planes\nof solid light, which gradually shift and\nchange around them. It is something\nthat needs to be experienced.\nThis interaction with the pieces is\ncontinued with Doug Wheeler\u2019s work,\nin which the audience stands in the\ncentre of a room illuminated with a\nsquare of soft neon light which hangs,\nseemingly unsupported, from the far\nwall. The room has no corners \u2013 all\nhard lines have been removed \u2013 creating an extremely surreal environment.\nI \ufb01nd it di\ufb03cult to focus on anything;\nthe room seems to have become enveloped in white mist and I feel like I am\nviewing the world through a soft-focus\nlens. Disoriented, I try to seek relief\nSecond coming in Slough multi-story said to be anticlimactic\n\n"

The fact that there are already\n\ufb01ve people who have been nominated\nfor ICU President also shows that the\ncompetition is hotting-up.\nThis should not deter any would be\ncandidates, who still have until 23.59\non the night of the 3rd of March to go\nonline and nominate themselves. For\neverybody to get involved in, the actual voting opens at 12:00 on Friday the\n8th March and closes a week later on\nthe 15th March. The \ufb01nal results will\nbe announced at the Results Party in\nMetric the same evening.\nNiall Jeffrey\nA paper from the College Secretary\nreveals that Imperial College\u2019s undergraduate application rate has increased on last year against a backdrop\nof falling applicant rates to UK universities across the board. Postgraduate\napplication numbers, however, are at\npresent lower than last year.\nThe number of students applying\nto study undergraduate courses at\nImperial for 2013 entry is up by 4.2%\ncompared to last year\u2019s 2012 entry sta-tistics. This is more signi\ufb01cant against\nthe trend in the UK, with last year\u2019s\nUCAS data revealing a 7.4% drop in\napplication rates in a year.\nThe cause for the drop has been attributed to combination of various\ne\ufb00ects including ripples from the tuition fees rise and population e\ufb00ects.\nThe main group causing the fall is UK\napplicants who, in the UCAS data,\nhad an even greater 8.7% drop. Apparently, according to the National\nUndergraduate applications\nfor next year rise while\npostgraduates fall\nO\ufb03ce for Statistics, the number of 18\nyear olds in the UK population is fall-ing; the drop was at the rate of 1.4%\nlast year. Imperial College has a large\nnumber of overseas and international\nstudents, with ~30% from outside the\nEU, so would be less a\ufb00ected than\nmost other universities.\nOf course, Imperial is still an attractive prospect. The is still high in the\nleague tables and is a relatively well\nknown university, so it may be that it\nis continuing to attract students even\nwhen universities seem to be a less\ncredible choice.\nIn contrast to this, the postgraduate \ufb01gures are down on last year. It is\nstill early in the recruitment cycle, and\nso this \ufb01gure is not yet concrete. The\nManagement Board have responded\nby requesting monthly updates on the\nsituation with fresh \ufb01gures.\nNiall Jeffrey\nUnion elections\nopen\n\n"
