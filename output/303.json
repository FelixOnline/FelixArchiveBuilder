    "content": "Page 2 FELIX Thursday, 21st October, 1971\nI.C. FOR SALE\nIn the last six months one of the biggest and most consistent headlines has been large\nscale redundancy and unemployment and, very naturally, at the beginning of July, how this\naffected graduates and school leave rs. Many students in the coming session will have to\nthink about obtaining a job and what sort of job they want. It is going to be all too easy\nto sit back and assume that at the end of the year, as a graduate, you are going to drop\ninto a nice convenient, ready-made to taste occupation. This was seen last year where\nthose students who applied late or in a casual way in most cases had difficulty in obtaining employment. It is no longer a valid assumption that there are plenty of jobs for anyone with a degree.\nIn a recession, which we appear to be in at the moment,\none of the first sections in which expansion fails to make normal progress is research and development. It is into this section that most of I.C.'s graduates will be trying to obtain\nemployment.\nIn the coming session there is a very rough timetable\nin which an undergraduate can hope to obtain a job. It\ngoes as follows:\u2014\nAutumn Term. Decision on the type of employment re-qui red. Isolate the firms to which this employment applies.\nFind out information about these firms. Fill in application\nforms for first interview.\nFirst interviews. (Most of these will take\nSpring Term.\nplace at college).\nEaster Vacation. Second interviews at the firms pre-mises.\nSummer Term. Receive acceptances or rejections from\nfirms. The final choice as to which firm to go to.\nEach step will have a time deadline but this is no more\nthan an aid to the clerical staff arranging visits. The more\ninterest you show in getting your application form in early\nand the more interest you show in the firms you apply to\nthe more chance you have of obtaining a job.\nThe Appointments office has two functions. Firstly it\nhelps the undergraduate to make a decision on the type\nof employment he wishes. A pamphlet is published by the\nU.L. Appointments Board called \"Main Areas of Graduate\nEmployment.\" Once the undergraduate has some idea of this\nhe can go to several people and publications for advice on\nwhich firms are suitable to this requirement. Firstly, every\ndepartment has a member of staff who is directly concerned\nwith employment and he will be making himself known to all\nthird years at the beginning of this term. Many departments\nalso have a careers library. For obvious reasons these people\ncannot be experts in all forms of employment and there is\nfurther and much wider advice available from the Appointments Office in College Block. Mr. Ashworth of the U.L. Appointments Board visits this College every week and is\nmore than glad to give advice to anyone who asks. There is\nalso a comprehensive Careers library adjacent to this office\nwhich students are welcome to browse through.\nCome spring and the application forms are in, the Appointments Office serves its second function, bringing employer and prospective employee together. Then it is up to\nthe individual student to convince the employer of his choice\nthat he is worth employing.\nArmstrong) Room 306,\nAppointments Office. (Mrs.\nCollege Block. Int.

Society The British Society for\nSocial Responsibility in\nScience was formed two\nyears ago by scientists who\nwere dissatisfied with some\nof the things science and\ntechnology are doing to the\nworld we Mve in, and who\nwanted to do something\nabout it. Since then, many\ngood things have happened.\nThere have been conferences,\nmeetings and campaigns to\nget \"establishment\" organisations like the British Association for the Advancement\nof Science to take social consequences more seriously.\nPartly because of the Society's formation, people are\nnow talking far more realistically about the effects of\ntechnology on our en v iron ment.\nNow there is to be an \"Im-peri al College Society for\nSocial Responsibility in\nScience\", an autonomous\nbranch of the national so-cie ty. There will be a lively\nseries of meetings with guest\nspeakers such as Kit Pedlar,\nwriter of 'Doomwatch' Prof.\nColin Cherry and Jerry Ravetz. The first meeting will be\non October 26th at 7.00 p.m. in Mech. Eng. 342. Also this\nterm there will be a series\nof special discussions under\nthe general title of 'Science\nand Technology in the 3rd World', starting October 19th in Physics S.

If you bothered to\nread it, and no doubt two or three uneducated fresher s did, you might have discovered\nan IC organisation that believes in i the existence of a life style somewhat less endowed\nthan our little orgasm of affluence.\nEnough of this cynicism, let me provide\nyou with some facts. Firstly, UNSA 3W1 is\nthe combined IC branches of the United Nations Students Association and the Third\nWorld First Organisation. Its aims are\nsimple:\u2014\u2022\n(i) To educate people about the problems\nof the third, or developing world and to\nmake us aware of our responsibilities. (It is\noften argued that we have none, we belive\nwe have).\n(ii) To make students aware that it is\nwithin their power through the medium of\nVSO and other similar organisations to help\ndirectly in the solutions of these problems.\n(iii) To help raise funds for organisations\nalready supplying aid (Oxfam, War on\nWant, UNICEF, The 3W1 Educational\nTrust, Christian Aid and many others).\nThe order of these aims is no mistake,\nmoney is needed, but on such a vast scale\nmust ultimately be from the governments of\nthe civilised(?) first world. However, these\ngovernments will only bother to do more\nthan conscience-relieving sized foreign aid\nschemes (I think that's intelligible) if there\nis a massive popular demand, hence e duca tion. It'sac liche worth repeating, that the\nfirst thing you learn at university is how\nlittle you know, and despite the TV gore of\nBiafra and Bangla Desh, etc., where the\nthird world is concerned, this is one hell of\nan understatement. There is the USA's crippling economic exploitation of most of Latin\nAmerica (not leftist propaganda but fact)\nthe plight of India and Pakistan, and the\n'Politics' of Africa, North and South. This\nis without mentioning such humdrum\nphrases as the population explosion, the en-v ironmen t, and educating the blacks (no\noffence).\nWhy bother with another goody goody organisation when Carnival, now USK rag,\nhas the monopoly and is more entertaining?\nThe answer is simply that there is a desperate need. USK Rag we hope will raise much\nmoney for local and national charities; we\nwould like to expand student responsibility\nto an International level.\nFinally, as always there is money. UNSA\n3W1 hope to get a large response from IC\nfor its banker's order campaign. This involves signing a banker's order to give as\nlittle or as much of your grant to whichever\nforeign aid scheme you choose. An action\nthat is a thought out decision, not just a means to remove the collecting tin. If inter-este d, please contact Geoffe Rowe of Physics 2 and look out for UNSA 3W1 meet-in gs. \"Smashing\nTime\" at\nLinstead\nWe offer our sincere condolences to Dave Lee, of\nLinstead Hall, for the lacerations he sustained when he\nsucceeded in walking through\na plate glass window there.\nHe's not the first to do this\nthough \u2014 he actually followed in the footsteps of an\nex-editor of 'FELIX', who\nonce, when rather the worse\nfor drink, ran (or rather, tot-te red) down the stairs and\nstraight through the same\nwindow. Why don't you go\nthe whole hog and join us,\nDave???\nMembers of the 'FELIX'\nstaff can remember there being a table placed in front\nof that window last year, deliberately to stop anybody\nwalking, running or jumping\nthrough it. We wonder which\nunthinking person removed\nit \u2014 it might be a good idea\nif he or she returned it soon,\nbefore someone really does\nthemselves an injury. Come\nto think of it, I don't think\nthis year's editor has tried it\nyet, but then, he lives in Linstead, so, sooner or later . . .\nSTUDENTS!\nThis is\nordinary\nThis notebook cum folder\ncum writing pad cum penh older is\nBarclays free gift for students who\nopen an account with us in 1971.\nNo bank charges for you,\neither, provided you keep your\naccount in credit.

It may also be his last, unless the Union duplicator gets rapidly repaired or someone offers the use of another in full working order\nwhich I and assistants can commandeer for most of alternate Wednesday\nafternoons. It is the_ fault of the duplicator that this do en't look\nvery,good or that you can't read this, in which' case( the latter) I suggest you petition the Union for not only a screw for the paper feed\nretainer but a separation bar to get the copies out of the duplicator once you've got the paper in, otherwise they go round and round for ever and ever and ever, . . . . . . . . . The main reason why this sheet isn't still going round is because we minimise d on ink, to stop the copies from sticking, and probably you from reading this.*.. But enough of this} on with the late news items which is really why\n\u2022FELICITY* exists kite/t new/\nTuesday's Council meeting decided quite a number of things, important ones\nbeing listed below. And so they should have: the meeting lasted from 5.30\nuntil11.30(1 don't believe it that' s AFTER closing time t!Ed.) CCIUMIIE\ndecided that if they had to pay for 'JfENNET', they^ n ly wanted 50 copies, refused to buy a Synthesis er for Wellsoc for \u00a3330, as that' s half their term's allocation( the Union's, not WellSoc)\ndecided that the Union's priorities, for this term atleast, should be\n1) Diversification2) Accomodation\n3) Information problem\n4) Job Situation5) Student Union Autonomy\n(when will they think of something original????? Ed.) These priorities will not necessarily be the same for the whole year, and will be reviewed\nat every Council meeting.\nIt is now official Union policy to attempt to preserve the lamps in Prince Consort Road, and atleast one Union member, whose instigation this preservation motion was, is prepared to chain himself to each and\nevery one if necessary to stop the Ken and Chel Council from pulling them\nup, which is scheduled for Novemeber.\nUNION LOUNGE\nApparently the Union Lower Lounge improvements have paid off. The\npinball machines took \u00a365 in the first week of term alone, of which\nthe Union will receive half. The JukeBox suppliers will change up\nto four records every fortnight, and the Union, in the large and un mistake able shape of Dave Amos, obviously relies on users' requests\nto pass on.

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX Thursday, 21st October, 1971\nCanned Heat what's Only three films to be reviewed in this issue. The first\nof these is 'GIMME SHELTER'. This is the Maysles\nBrothers' film of the Rolling\nStones' tour of America in\n1969 culminating in the free\nconcert at the Altamont\nspeedway. All the film leads\nup to the Altamont concert,\nwhere there was repeated violence in the crowd and a Hell's Angel knifed a man\nto death. This film has been\nseen as an ironic sequel to\n'Woodstock' but the film is\nvery different; 'Woodstock'\npresented a view of the size\nand grandeur of the event\nand tried to produce a message out of this ('the largest\ngathering of people ever in\none place who didn't join in\nbattle') whereas 'Gimme\nShelter' concentrated on the\ndiffering responses of the\npeople involved. There are\nmany other thoughts that\ncould be derived from this\nfilm of the Altamont concert\nbut to make this review brief\nFilms\nI recommend you to go and\nsee it, because this film is the\nbest example so far of the\nfusion between cinema-ve rite and rock music.\nOn the other hand 'MAD\nDOGS AND ENGLISHMEN' is just a rock film, no\nparticular message just a film\nof Jock Cocker's tour of America with the 'Mad Dogs and\nEnglishmen', it is quite funny\nand very enjoyable with\nabout twenty songs all done\nin Joe Cocker's own very\noriginal style.\nIf you have kept the last\nedition of 'Felix' you will, see\nthat in there I reviewed 'The\nMusic Lovers' and in this edition I 'll take a look at Ken\nRussell's latest film 'THE\nDEVILS'. The problem with\nKen Russell's films based upon historical fact is to decide\nwhat is historical fact and\nwhat is Ken Russell. He\nseems to have followed the\nbook 'The Devils of Loudon'\nby Aldous Huxley very close-ly. It could be described as\na typical Ken Russell film;\nall the erotic sequences are\nthere, he uses the claustrophobic sets that look so artificial and theatrical but\nwhich are so beautiful. Yet\nit does not stand comparison\nwith 'The Music Lovers'; it\nis probably much more factual than 'The Music Lovers'\nyet by not editing the film\ntastefully, his film struck me\nas being very sensational using a combination of gory\ndetails and erotic sequences\nto 'sell' the film. Out of the\ncast Oliver Reed as Father\nGrandier, the lecherous but\nhonourable priest, and Vanessa Redgrave as the crippled\nnun infatuated with Father\nGrandier come out the best.\nIn the next issue I hope to\nbe reviewing Barney PlattsMills' second film 'Private\nRoad' and (possibly) 'And\nNow For Something Completely Different'.\nJohn Bryan\nTerry Riley:\n\"A Rainbow in Curved Air\"\nTerry Riley is an American contemporary classical\ncomposer with whom listeners to avant-garde Jazz and\nRock are probably familiar.\nHis work \"Keyboard Studies\" was performed at the\nProms in 1970 on the same\nevening as the performance\nof Soft Machine, on whose\nmusic he has considerable in-flu en ce. \"Rainbow\" was released in the USA in 1969\nthough CBS have up till now\nnot released it over here.\nAnyway, now that it has been\nreleased, there should be no\nexcuse for anyone who has\nnot heard this remarkable al-bum. The title track, which\nRecords\noccupies the whole of the\nfirst side, is a composition for\nvarious keyboard instruments; over a background of\npre-recorded loops appear almost frenetically played note\nsequences in a sort of con-versa tion. The overall effect\nis one of continuous variety;\non the first listening you become hypnotised by one note\nsequence and the others are\nrelegated to the background,\nwhile on the second listening\nanother sequence captures\nyour attention, and so on.\nThe second -side of the\nalbum is taken up with \"Pop-py Nogood and the Phantom\nBand\", an even more mystic\npiece of music than \"Rain-bow\". It begins with a series\nof loops compounded in a collage, like Soft Machine's \"Out-Bloody-Rageous\" (Sor-ry, \"Out-Bloody-Rageous\" is\nlike it), followed by a long\nsection featuring Terry on\nsoprano sax, using repeating\nloops again and echo de vic es, described on the cover as\n\"Spatially Separated Mirror\nImages\". It's reminiscent of\n\"Hall of Mirrors\", another\nof Terry's works which I hope everyone's heard. Both\npieces evoke a very strange\natmosphere, and to those\nwho think \"The New Music\"\nended with boring, deafening,\nfree-form improvisation I can\nonly say put this on the player and close your eyes.\nThe first time I saw Canned Heat was a bright sunny\nmorning on a Festival field\nin Somerset. They had a singer so fat he nearly stomped\nhis way through the stage,\none guitarist with a voice like\nan owl and another who stayed rooted to the spot for the\nwhole act\u2014they were a sen-s ation. Changes have come\nsince then: Al \"Blind Owl\"\nWilson is dead and Bob Hite\nhas lost a lot of weight, but\non Monday night Heat showed they're still capable of\nplaying the meanest rock a boogie ever to shake the\nfoundations of the Albert\nHall.\nThey were preceded by\nStone the Crows, who received a well-deserved ovation\nfor their polished act. A solid\nrhythm section of Colin Allen\nand Steve Thompson (re-member them with John\nMayall?) backs up the very\nskilful Les Harvey on guitar\nland of course singer Maggie\nBell. She has all the earthy\nappeal of Janis Joplin or\nTina Turner and a voice to\nmatch either. If any group\ncan put everything into their\nmusic and still give an impression of superb relaxation\nthen Crows are that group.\nWatch them because they're\ngoing places.\nCanned Heat came on to\nan enthusiastic reception\nfrom a crowd obviously undeterred by the not-so-enthusiastic reviews the group had\nreceived on this tour. On the\nnumbers for which he was\nfeatured singer/guitarist Joel\nScott-Hill proved himself a more-than-adequate replacement for Al Wilson without\ntrying to sound like him, although most of the time Hill\nplayed rhythm guitar to\nHenry Vestine's lead. As well\nas new numbers like \"Long\n- Way from LA\" they included\nold favourites \"Let's Work\nTogether\", \"Goin' up Country\" and the inevitable \"Re-fried Boogie\" which the\ncrowd were shouting for all\nnight. We were treated to a30 minute version featuring\na fairly free-form, but not\ntoo long solo from Vestine,\nan organ break from Tony\nAshton, who is a company ing the group on this tour, and a drum solo from Fitb de la\nParra which even in these\ndays when super drum solos\nare ten-a new-penny was\ntruly phenomenal.\nThe music critics are always quick to kick a group\nwhen they're down and since\nthe death of Al Wilson Heat\nhave suffered rather badly\nat the hands of the press.\nHow much of the criticism\nwas justified I don't know,\nbut now they really are as\ngood as ever, and I hope this\nperformance proved it once\nand for all.\nON\nOCTOBER Thur 21\n1.30-2.20 pm Lecture\nTheatre B, Level 5, College Block.

Vorster,\nPremier of South Africa,\nSeptember 10th,1971, on\nAustralian cancellation of the\nSpringbok cricket tour.\nMr. Vorster, it seems, is\ndetermined to continue his\nracist policies and to maintain the police state in South\nAfrica which makes white\nsupremacy possible. Most\npeople in this country abhor\nVorster (who was interned\nduring the Second World War\nfor Nazi activities) and his\napartheid policies yet seem\nto do little about it. Indeed\nthe present Tory government\nis encouraging his regime by\nsupplying arms to South\nAfrica, in defiance of the\nU.N. and refusing to stop or\neven curb British investments\nthere. The Tories are even\ntalking about a negotiated\nsettlement with Rhodesia\nwhen it is clear that any such\nsettlement will be a sell-out\nto racism.\nThe main movement outside South Africa attacking\napartheid is the Anti-Apartheid movement. This is based here in England because\nwe still have many links with\nSouth Africa; British capital\nmakes up 60 per cent of all\nforeign investment there. The\nAnti-Apartheid movement\naims to destroy apartheid by\nisolating white South Africa\nfrom all forms of sporting\nand cultural contact, by attacking the capitalist system\nin South Africa by pressurizing British firms to cease in-vestment, by stopping arms\ngetting to South Africa and\nby supporting the Freedom\nFighters there.\nThe recent successes of the\nmovement, particularly in\nisolating South Africa from\ninternational sport, has made\nit Vorster's main enemy outside Africa. The Anti-Apartheid movement is watchful\nfor attempts by Vorster to\ndestroy it, especially as it was\nrevealed recently that South\nAfrican security agents were\nin this country, supposedly\nfor 'training', and were receiving co-operation from\nScotland Yard.\nThere has 'been talk recently of setting up an AntiApartheid movement within\nI.C. There are many aspects\nof Anti-Apartheid policy\nwhich can be applied here.\nNotably within the Royal\nSchool of Mines where scholarships are offered to white\nSouth African students to\nstudy here. It is already Stuready Student Union policy\nno South African food here,\nin the refectories, but an\nAnti-Apartheid movement\ncould act as a watch-dog to\nensure this was being en for c ed. It could also try and\nmake students aware of British firms with investments in\nSouth Africa so that their\ngoods can be boycotted. Another sphere where an AntiApartheid movement could\nbe useful is in exposing racial discrimination within an\narea where many I.C. students live, namely Notting\nHill.\nIt is hoped to have a meeting soon with a speaker from\nAnti-Apartheid.

These were judged to have been\nsuccessful and it was decided that this year's expedition\nshould go further afield. Discussions last Autumn led to\nAndorra being chosen as the venue. Andorra is a small\nprincipality set high in the Pyrenees, between France and\nSpain. The terrain is rough, the lowest parts being about 5,000\nfeet a.s.l., rising to peaks of almost 10,000 feet. The system\nof government of Andorra is unique, in that it is jointly ruled\nby the Bishop of Urgell (in Spain), and by the President of\nFrance. The forests and uncultivated land is common land, so\nAndorra is popular with campers. Since there is only one\nresident radio amateur in Andorra, it is considered quite\n\"rare\" radio-wise, although an increasing number of amateurs\nfrom France visit the country at weekends. After deciding\nthat the main objectives of the expedition should be to contact England on the two metre amateur band, and to contact.\n100 countries on the other amateur bands, detailed planning\ncommenced.\nAfter the usual frantic last-minute arrangements, the party\nof ten members left Southside at noon on Saturday, 26th June. The Hovercraft crossing to Calais was made an hour\nearlier than planned, owing to quick progress down the M2.\nThe party then drove on through France until Sunday morn-ing, when a convenient camp site was found at Nevers. The\nroute to Andorra was to be rather indirect, via Perpignan,\nsince, in spite of our efforts, the French authorities had not\nsent the transmitting licence to London, and their offices were\nat Perpignan. The party reached Perpignan on Monday morn-ing, and after negotiations (in French!!), we were told that we\ncould find out the callsign allocated, by telephoning from\nAndorra, and the paperwork would be forwarded later. Having left the address of a friend of a friend of one of the\nparty, we drove on to Saillagouse, just outside Andorra. The\nnext morning we crossed into the Principality. At the top of\nthe pass, we found the station of Sud Radio, one of the two\nlocal broadcast stations. This warranted a visit, and we found\nthat Andorra's sole radio amateur was the Chief Technician\nthere. He showed us round the transmitting equipment, and\nalso took us to the balcony on top of the station building, to\nsee the superb scenery. He also told us how, in winter, the\nstation is entirely self contained\u2014the power lines are taken\ndown before the blizzards blow them down.\nHaving replenished our food supplies in Andorra la Vella,\nthe capital, the question then arose of where to camp and set\nup the radio station. Investigation of two known sites showed\nthat although they were fine locations so far as VHF radio\nwas concerned, they were not easily accessible with the Land\nRover and trailer. Eventually, towards evening, we continued\nthrough Andorra towards Spain, and left the main road before turning off up a steep track towards the plateau of\nRabassa. Map reading was hampered by the fact that we\nwere using a French map which did not, as it turned out later,\nshow our road. The Spanish map had been given up pre-vio us ly, since it had fallen apart soon after we had bought\nit. However, after various expressions of doubt, we continued\nupwards, and arrived on the plateau at 10 p.m. After pitching the tents, we all slept soundly until the next morning,\nwhen the problem arose of finding out where we were. After\nusing such advanced map-reading techniques as taking bearings on unidentified hills and tracks, and turning round in\ncircles while pointing a compass in arbitrary directions, someone found the appropriate piece of the Spanish map, and\nproved that we had, indeed, arrived at Rabassa. The map also\nshowed how we had arrived there, and the prospect of collecting provisions regularly by this route caused some alarm.\nLater that day, the main station was put on the air, and the\nVHF equipment was prepared for transport to the top of the\nhighest hill around. The hurried construction of the VHF gear\nwas soon apparent, and rebuilding took place regularly.\nHaving telephoned Perpignan and obtained the callsign\nC31DZ, a visit was made to the address given previously for\nthe forwarding of the transmitting licence. Upon enquiring\nabout the whereabouts of the house concerned, the local inhabitants became distinctly perturbed, and it transpired that\nthe address had been frequented by a criminal on the run\nfrom Interpol. After a hurried change of plan, the College\naddress was left with the local postmaster, who said that\nhe would send the licence on to London. It has yet to arrive.\nOn Friday, some of the party visited the proposed VHF site, to prove its accessibility. Later that afternoon, several\nof those remaining took the Land Rover to the aid of a French couple who had got their Mini-moke stuck in a bog\nnot far from our camp site. After extracting them, our star\ndriver managed to get our vehicle stuck in the bog as\nwell, until it was resting on the sump and axles. After\nseveral fruitless efforts to dig it out, it was necessary to resort to more primitive methods. Two\nsmall trees were sawn down from the nearby forest,\nand these were used to lever the Land Rover out by\nits front bumper (how many other vehicles could be lifted out\nof a bog by their front bumper?). That evening, after our\nown celebration with several bottles of local wine, the Frenchman and his wife turned up with a large flagon of port as a token of their gratitude. The state of inebriation which resulted led to an early close down of the radio station, and also a late start the next morning.\nThe next day, the VHF operators were taken to their site,\nand helped up to it with the tent and radio gear. On the way\nback the Land Rover was doing well until it reached a wet,\ngrassy 1 in 1 slope. It was therefore left halfway up the slope\nuntil the next morning. It was duly retrieved, just before a heavy rainstorm. Daily visits were made to Andorra la Vella\nfor food and to pick up water at a spring on the way down\nthe mountain. The journey time was reduced from almost two\nhours to just under 1 hour (17 kilometres on the road, descending 5,000 feet)\u2014some indication of the increasing confidence (??) of the drivers.\nThe VHF station and operators were fetched back without\nincident. They had not succeeded in contacting England, because of a combination of equipment failures and very severe\nweather conditions, which kept the station off the air for\nmuch of the time.\nFinally, we must express\nthanks to all those, both\nwithin the College, and else-where, who helped to organise the expedition, particularly Frank Potter and Ken\nWeale for their last minute\nhelp in financial arrange-ment s. Scholarships\nAbroad\nA booklet giving information on scholarships abroad available\nto students who will be\ngraduates in 1972 has\nbeen sent to the editor\nand is available in the\npress room (third floor\nunion building) to anybody who is interested.\nPostcript\nRadSoc will be holding a coffee evening cum film show\non Wednesday, 27 October,\nat 1930 in Elec.

Operatic Society as one of\nthe highlights of the summer\nentertainment at the Public\nHall of this quiet East Devon\ntown. Highlight it is indeed\nfor, although the wiring in\nthe hall is potentially lethal\nin the opinion of the lighting\ndirector, and the stage crew\nwould like to see the stage\nrebuilt, Opsoc manage to put\non a very professional show.\nThis year the production\nwas another G. and S. opera,\n\"The Gondoliers\". A total of\nnine performances were put\non including one matinee. All\nwere well attended, particularly the last night, when as\nmany people as possible \u2014\nwith a liberal interpretation\nof the fire regulations\u2014were\npacked into the hall.\nOpsoc arrived in Budleigh\nSalterton, on July 17th, and\nthe first three days were\nspent rehearsing and painting the scenery. After a well\nreceived first night, everyone\nhad more free time. The\nbeach although it consists entirely of pebbles soon became\na popular place to spend the\nday.\nThe local people were very\nfriendly and only too pleased\nto help\u2014especially members\nof the tennis club who invited everyone round for\ndrinks on more than one oc-casio n. Everyone enjoyed\nthemselves and it was\ncertainly a holiday to\nmember.\nThis coming February\nOpsoc are putting\n\"Yeoman of the Guard.\"\nNew members are always\nwelcome, whether you want\nto sing or help backstage.\nMeetings are held every\nTuesday, at 7.30 p.m. in\nMech Eng 342 and if you\ndon't want to join you can\nalways come along and\nwatch in February.\nre-on\nChairman Wanted S.

I got this degree and I thought . . . \"\n\"Yes, I'm sure we can\nhelp, would Monday, 9.30,\ndo?\"\nGetting a holiday job\nmay be this easy, but finding\na career isn't. No one really\nneeds the Meacocks of this\nworld to tell final year students they'll soon be out in\nthe cold. Many students are\nlikely to make the wrong decision at first. In College,\nimaginative projects like\nVacation Training fail to\ngive a true view of working\nin industrial laboratories and\nthe like. Clearly when the\nreal thing arrives, the easy\nLife at University for most\npeople is very enjoyable and\noften exciting. There is\nalways something to do,\nsomeone to talk to. But for\nalmost every student there\nare times when they feel\nreally down, either due to\nacademic matters or some\nprivate problem. At times\nlike this, you feel the need\nto have a talk with some-one, either just for the company or to discuss some particular problem. But is there\nalways someone there to go\nand chat with? Most students have a friend they get\non well with, but are they\nalways there at the particular\nmoment they are required?\nWorse still, there are some\nstudents who suddenly find\nthere is no one they can talk\nfrankly with or no one they\ncan turn to without feeling\nthey are imposing on them.\nNow who else could a lonely student turn to? Well,\nuntil last April, he had four\ncourses open to him: \u2014\n(a) Go and talk with his\ntutor or supervisor and ask\ntheir advice.\n(b) Go and see Dr. Grey in\nthe Health Centre at 14\nPrinces Gardens, who could\nrefer him if necessary to Dr.\nStorey, the College psychiatrist, who visits the Health\nCentre twice a week.\n(c) Go and see the Student\nCounsellor, Mrs. Hartnett,\nwho is also available at the\nHealth Centre without appointment on Tuesdays,\nThursdays and Fridays.\n(d) Go and impose himself on some other student,\nhoping that he might be sym-pathetic.\natmosphere vanishes and you\nas an employee are faced\nwith a novel amount of re-sp on sibi lit y. Lose the job\nand you may have difficulty\nfinding another.\nThe easiest decision must\nbe to postpone the decision\nitself. Well. . .\n1. I.C. still approves of\nfurther qualifications, even if\nindustry sometimes turns up\nits nose. You can do some\nM. Sc.'s on lower class de-g rees.2. For the rest of us, the\npossibilities are less, but no\nless interesting. A job for\nsay a year in anywhere from\na bakery to a building site\nmay provide valuable ex-peri en ce, thinking time and\nfinance for consideration of\na job abroad. (Remember, as\nan assisted immigrant in AusNIGHTLINE\nHowever these above alternatives were only available\nduring the day and it is perhaps in the evening and at\nnight, when a somewhat\nlonely student is feeling at\nhis worst. Thus it was felt\nthat some services similar to\nthat provided by the Samaritans could be offered by\nstudents to other members of\nthe College.\nAnd so Nightline was born.\nA number of volunteers went\nthrough a series of lectures\nand had a field test. Now a telephone is manned at\nNightline between the hours\nof 6 p.m. and 9 a.m. Two\nvolunteers are on duty every\nnight and a third person\nsleeps nearby to aid them in\nan emergency. A flying squad\nwill shortly be available to\nenable volunteers to go out\nto students in need.\nHow do you contact Nightline?\nShould any student feel at\nany time that he or she would\nlike to talk to sympathetic\nfellow students, then he can\ncontact us through the internal telephone system No.:\n2 4 6 8\nor the external telephone system No.:\n5 8 1 - 2 4 6 8\nor by coming to 8 Princes\nGardens, which is next door\nto the swimming pool.\nAny information given \"to\none of our volunteers will be\ntreated in total confidence.\ntr alia, for example, a decision to move on before two\nyears will cost you the full\nreturn fare).\n3. If leaving the country\nfor a couple of years really\ndoes appeal to you, then\nVSO could provide the means\nand also interesting work,\nfor example educational projects in under-developed\ncountries. If you really enjoy\nthe work then they may ask\nyou to continue.\n4. Many liberal-minded\nuniversity students often find\nsatisfaction in teaching for a few years. This requires a one-year B. Ed, course and a year in teaching to secure the\nqualifications. The rest is up\nto you.\n5. Ignore your degree alto-get her. Be a painter or a bus\nconductor \u2014 remember degrees aren't really so few and\nfar between.\nNEW VOLUNTEERS\nWith quite a lot of last\nyear's volunteers being in\ntheir third year. Nightline now\nrequires some replacements\nfor them, as well as other\npeople, who are willing to\nhelp in some way, so that\nwe can build up a really efficient service to the community. There are a number of\nways in which people can\nhelp: \u2014\n(a) By entering the next\ntraining programme, which\nwill be starting at the beginning of November and\ngiven with the help of the\nLondon Samaritans.\n(b) By being the third person (untrained) on duty at\nnights. This person on most\noccasions will get a full\nnight's sleep, but in the event\nof a crisis, it will be their job\nto arrange transport if necessary, to summons another\nvolunteer if one of those on\nduty has to leave the centre,\netc.\nIt is hoped again to build\nup a transport system of our\nown for use in the event of\nan emergency, without having\nto rely on public transport.\n(c) If you own a car and\nlive in hall you can be included on a transport rota.\n(d) If you can drive, but\ndon't have your own car, and\nyou live in hall then you can\nstill be included on this rota,\nas we hope to have the use of\nsome of the college vehicles.\nIf you feel you would like\nto help in some way either\ncall in at No. 8, Prince's Gardens one evening or contact\nthe Director, I.C. Nightline,\nc/o the I.C. Union Office.\nTwo years ago, a questionnaire was sent to all\nundergraduates asking them\nif they wanted the opportunity of taking non-technical\nstudies as part of their degree courses. Of the 50%\nresponse, over 90% came out\nwith a firm YES.\nOver the two intervening\nyears, this student demand\nhas been very much in evi-den ce. The Union has done a lot of work persuading departments to allow their students the option of basing up\nto say, 15% of their studies\non non-technical subjects\nwhich carry credit in the\nsame way as their technical\ncounterparts. This allows a student to take full advantage of I.C.'s special is ation( or to obtain a broader edu-cation, as he wishes).\nSome departments have\nbeen operating such schemes,\nin one form or another, for\na number of years, and now\nthe range of subjects covers\nSociology, Psychology, History of Science, Politics,\nTwentieth Century History,\nModern Literature and\nDrama, a Seminar on Progress, German and Russian.\nHowever, there are still some\ndepartments whose students\nare not given the opportunity to attend any of the\nabove courses, let alone gain\ncourse-credits for doing so.\nWe hope that this year will\nsee the appointment of an\n\"Academic Director\", who,\nas a senior staff member, will\nbe responsible for co-or d in at ing the field of Associated\nStudies on matters of policy,\nhelped by individual members of staff housed in departments as at present. This\nshould encourage those\ndubious departments to participate in what should become a college-wide system\nof options.\nThere is another, even\nmore important, side to your\neducation here as scientists\nand engineers; and that is\nthe relation that a particular\nbranch of science or technology has to other branches\nand to society in general. The\nimportance of tying together the teaching of any\nscientific discipline and its\npast, present and potential\neffects on society and the\nworld in general should be\nopenly realised, and discussion on the subject should\nbecome an integral part of\nany under gr atu ate course in\nthis college. We may thereby\nhope to produce thinking and\nsocially responsible people as graduates.\nProjects, which may have a basis in a science or technology and proceed from there\nto examine social, political\nand economic implications,\nare immensely valuable in\nfostering this awareness; projects of this nature are undertaken in some departments,\nft is true that a student may\nget only as far as formulating the problems involved in\nthe area he is looking at and\nsupplying possible methods\nof solving them, without\ncoming up with the definitive answer\u2014but he will have\nlearnt a great deal in doing\nso. The staff concerned with\nAssociated Studies subjects\nprovide invaluable back-up\nfor this type of work, and\nmany staff are finding that\nthey can contribute more\nthan even they expected. Another advantage of project\nwork is that it does\nnot involve timetabled lectures (i.e. does not disrupt\nthe timetable from the administrative point of view),\nand leaves much more to the\ninitiative of the individual\nstudent.\nBroad-based projects may\ncertainly prove to be the\nmajor academic development\non a College-wide front\nduring the next few years at\nImperial.\nIan Mackenzie,\nAcademic Affairs\nOfficer,\nI.C.

Rag's first fund-raising event of the year took\nplace at the opening of South Ken's new Pizza Palace, the\nsickeningly-titled \"Pizza Resistance\", in Exhibition Road\non Sunday week. The main event of the opening was what\nthe owners proudly announced was Britain's first-ever Pizza\nRace, which, for the uninitiated, is exactly the same as a pancake race\u2014except, of course, that you toss pizzas instead\nof pancakes. The whole affair was obviously the brainchild\nof an even-more-than-usually eccentric P.R. agency, and\ncame complete with so-called Bunny Girls (minus tails and\nlong ears) and balloons, eagerly clutched (the balloons, not\nthe girls) by an enthusiastic crowd of the local youth.\nSTUDENTS THRASHED BY TEENAGER The first race was run by\nthe five presidents of the I.C. unions, and was won, just,\nby Dave Amos, vice-pre si dent of I.C., who apparently\ncollected a free pizza as\nprize. The other race in\nwhich the athletic types of\nI.C.( all ten of them) took\npart was actually won by the\nonly other entrant\u2014a13 year-old boy!! Luckily they,\ntogether with the other fifty\nor so College supporters, had\nmore joy when it came to\ncollecting for the rag fund.\nHere, though, they were in\ncompetition with collectors\nfor the Mayor of Kensington's Play Association\nappeal, who collected \u00a350,\nfor which amount a cheque\nwas presented to the Mayor\nafter the races.\nABOVE: The recent reception of the Japanese\nEmperor at South Kensington Tube Station.\nFULL FRONTAL DISPLAY How many pizzas they\nsucceeded in selling by means\nof this happening is anyone's guess and their accountant's nightmare, but the assembled\nmultitude at the opening certainly seemed to be enjoying\nthemselves, even though I didn't see anybody eating a pizza at all. The restaurant\nitself is actually in the base-ment, although they're confident enough to put the\nkitchens on display in the\nfront window (which is more\nthan Mooney does). Prices\nare quite reasonable: pizzas\ncost from 35p up to 60p for\nthe Pizza Resistance itself: a 'Hamburger Steak', though,\ncan cost you 80p... the\nmind boggles!!!\nNews in Brief\nWho does she\nthink she is? How I hate getting up\nearly! But there we are\u2014\nfollowing a summons to see\na certain housekeeper, Linstead housekeeper, and I am\nprompt, there I was at her\noffice at the published opening times.\nFinding the good lady ab-sent, and not wishing to miss\nmy first lecture, I decided to\nseek her at her place. The\ngood lady took this as an intolerable intrusion, and we\nhence eventually arrived at\nher office, where the door\nwas closed against me.\nSo I knocked and entered,\nand the interview commenced thirty minutes late.\nRivals to Tesco? A review of the Southside\nShop is to take place next\nweek. The means of communicating your grievances\nand recommendations is nu-clear, but dedicated Felix\nreporters have it on best information that the review\nmay comprise McClooge and\nAmos breezing in for a look\naround. A recent Felix Probe\nstrongly criticised the lack of\nsavoury biscuits.\nMooneyoni\nLunchtime O 'Bric-a Brac\nAmateur entomologist and\npart-time catering manager,\nVictor Mooney, must be\ncongratulated, if Union reports that the refectories are\ncurrently in the black are to\nbe believed. Apparently Beit\nrefectory is doing well in\nresponse to the increased use\nof the Lower Lounge.\nYorkshire Pud\nFound in\n'Cockroach\nSpecial\nIt is bad enough to wake up to another day at IC but\nwhen a rather sinister-looking and tastefully-wrapped parcel\ndelivered to your bedside turns out to contain a half-eaten\npiece of Yorkshire Pudding with a Mooney patent cockroach\nin some, you immediately leap for action and that is what\nyour editor did\u2014and by 10 o 'clock that evening a reporter\nwas grilling Mr. Mooney (now that's a good idea . . .)\nWe quote his report in full\n\"Saw Mr. Mooney at 10\np.m. 'Probably a cockroach,\nwe've had some trouble with\nthem. The place has been\nsprayed several times!'\nThe chef, when asked to\ncomment, said that this was\nnot necessary as we had all\nthe evidence. He then said\nthat any place can expect to\nhave a few cockroaches.\nMr. Mooney told him not\nto say that as the magazine\nwould go to town on that.\n(And, folks, here we are!)\nFinally decided that it\nmight have come out of the\nflour used to make the Yorkshire Pudding.\nMr. Mooney said that the\ninsects had probably got into\nthe kitchens in the cardboard\ncontainers originally used to\ntransport foodstuffs. He\napologised and said that they\ntry to do what they can to\nwith a few explanatory notes :\nprevent these instances\noccurring.\nWhen the chef looked at\nthe exhibit, he broke a few\nbits off but reluctantly gave\nit back to me!!\"\nThe implications of this\nare really serious\u2014apart\nfrom trivia about the clean\nfoods Act, Public Health inspectors and the like\u2014think\nof all the changes that will\nhave to be made to our\nnational folk-lore. No more\njokes about 'waiter there's a fly in my soup'\u2014or indeed\n'waiter, there's soup in my\nflies'.\nWe shall all have to change\nover to cockroaches\u2014because who are we to contradict the chef's warning that\nwe can soon expect our\nkitchens to be well populated\nby these friendly (and tasty)\nlittle insects?\nDEATHS COLUMN\nOn October 6, 1971 A.

How much time have you spent furthering the ideas\nbehind U.S.K. this term? When you have thought about this\nfor a little while you can ask yourself where this College is\ngoing if U.S.K. does not grow faster than our insanity.\nThe day we enter this College we further the cause of\nnarrow mindedness and that is a sin, and none of these\nexcuses about never realising that you were guilty either. You\nknow now that you are guilty so begin to seek forgiveness.\nIf we are to accept that a centre for dedicated learning and\nresearch in the name of science is a good idea, which we have\ndone already by coming here, then somehow we must bring\nU.S.K. to the fore so that by social intercourse between ourselves and the other Colleges involved we can make our\nCollege a better place to live in.\nOver these first few weeks of term we all get invited to Hall\ndinners, fresher s dinners etc. and oddly enough the sense of\noccasion induced by these functions encourages most of the\npeople to attend. Why then can we not have U.S.K. functions,\nof similar nature. I think a joint fresher s dinner would be a superb idea. I think joint societies with, yes folks, joint wine\nand cheese parties are a superb idea and I think having\nsomebody in the union with enough personality and sense of\nsocial responsibility to make the effort to push U.S.K. to the\nfore is also a joint idea. So please, while you are spending\nyour energies fighting for the numerous rights that need\nfighting for please spare a little time each week to save what\ncould be a very pleasant College.\nNow that I 've finally found myself in the editorship of this\nwonderful newspaper I have also found it extremely exhausting trying to keep Felix an interesting topical newspaper. The\nonly way I can do this is if the students of the College contribute their views, news and any features they feel they can\nwrite that will be of interest to other students. You know\nwhere to find me, I don't bite often, so come along and contribute something. Felix is your newspaper why not use it.\nIt's worth keeping alive as well, I think.\nDave Sugden.\nLETTERS\nBAM In the last decade, growing numbers of people in Britain\nand elsewhere have become aware of the realities of world\npoverty \u2014 the misery of a family on the parched plains- of\nIndia or in the shanty towns of Latin America \u2014 and of the\nobligation of the West to bear its responsibilities.\nBAM (Brothers to All Men) is an organisation which feels\nthat many of the problems being faced by the people of the\nthird world are not going to be solved by sitting down at\nconference tables, or by the West exporting its highly\nsophisticated and very expensive equipment and machinery\nto the areas of greatest need. BAM believes that if 'develop-ment' is to have any valid or lasting meaning, it will have\nto be carried out by the people themselves, under their own\nleadership and using their own skills.\nSince BAM was founded in 1965, it has worked to this\nend by sending very carefully selected volunteers to various\nparts of the third world in an attempt to put into people's heads the idea of the potential there is to improve their\nown living conditions, and then put into their hands the\ntools to start the realisation of this idea.\nIt is with a specific aim \u2014 that of the betterment of all\nmen \u2014 and with suitable methods and means, which vary\naccording to region, that volunteers get down to the very\nhumble reality of everyday life at its foundations. They are\nconvinced that men, then communities must, before anything else, be encouraged to appreciate the possibilities,\nhowever limited, that lie in their own backyards. The bush-man, underfed, illiterate, ignorant, badly organised and\ntotally devoid of means, must himself appreciate that he\ncan gradually improve his lot so as to pass from the stage\nof survival to that of life.\nBAM Needs every scrap of support It can get so that\nits many projects can continue in the third world.\nIf you would like to know more about the activities of\nBAM, write now to :\nBROTHERS TO ALL MEN Man fieldHouse Southampton Street LONDON, WC2R OLR\nCONFERENCES Dear Sir,\nI take serious exception to the closing words of the article\non summer conferences in the last Felix, namely, \". . . it\nwould be a good idea if the organisations using I.C. facilities\nshould be vetted Ito see if their aims are in agreement with\nthose of the students.\"\nThis is an extremely dangerous statement if one considers\nall its implications.\nMay I just remind the author that:'\u2014\na) a democratic society tolerates various differing opinions\nand groups, at least so long as they do not directly threaten\nto undermine that society, and\nb) Nato =\n= evil is not an identity (something that is implied\nby the last paragraph of the article).\nI would also like to suggest to the author that he refrain\nfrom using the not-so-occasional I.C.U. tactics of slipping\nin statements/clauses that are purely polemical and bear\nlittle relevance to the usually quite reasonable main article.\nYours faithfully,\nDori schm ett erling. Sir,\nTo have these off-shore islands of ours divorced1 from the\nmain land of Europe or to join the Common Market \u2014 that\nis the question.\nBut it would be disastrous if that question were to divert\nus from many other important problems; for example, that\nof the environment. Not easily diverted would be those who\nlive beside the construction of a lethal, noisy, polluting, home-devouring motorway; a motorway which according to British\nRail, may cost about nine thousand per cent more than the\nsame length of their \"Superhighway\" (rail track) in urban\nareas. Even by present day standards this inflation is enormous. Industrial relations are kept before our eyes (especially\nwhen they are bad) and in large organisations they become a contest of power. However, there are small firms where\npersonal relationships are particularly vital, but one encounters supervisors who do not even take the trouble to\nlearn the names of those whom they supervise.\nProductivity is a word bandied about, but I would prefer\nto hear more of the two words \"know how\". They are, of\ncourse, related to technology and education.\nIt is education which really shapes our destiny, but\ndiversion is easy \u2014 almost inevitable \u2014 because of the wide\nrange of subjects which may be studied and the time lag\nbetween acquiring skill or knowledge and making use of it.\nThe cult of creativity, too, is disturbing because its adherents\ndo nd t seem to worry whether things are right or wrong,\nuseful or useless. Even more disturbing is the United Nations\n(UNESCO) observation that an academic truth does not\nalways have a counterpart in the real, practical world. The\nphrase \"its only academic\" is commonly used now.\nEducation must endeavour to regain its former status.\nYours sincerely,\nWATKYN JONES.\nWANTED: For I.C. Television News STOIC and FELIX\nwish to audition people willing to act as newscasters and\ninterviewers. Those who wish to attend should contact T.

Dear Felix,\nOn Thursday there was a party. That isn't exactly news;\nit was advertised all the first week on masses of faded pink\nposters. \"SEX\" said the biggest blackest letters, catching\neverybody's eye with remarkable success, \"30p\" said the\nsmallest, ignored, irrelevant and only a paltry sum anyway.\nSurprisingly not all that many took advantage of the enforced\ncelebrations and of those that did the bulk seemed to be\nfresher s like me, unaware of the subtle intricacies of I.C. social life. Some, like me have not yet persuaded themselves\nthat there are no intricacies in LC's social life.\nSocial life seems, with no experience to the contrary, to\nbe simple. Either it doesn't exist for those that are too busy\nworking, or it exists as at the party. And at the party it was\nsimple, exceedingly simple.\nFor blok es, the first step is to ask loudly for a pint of\nbeer, preferably quoting a specific make to show that you\nhave drunk enough to tell the difference. Then after a good\nswig and a healthy spasm of lip-licking the procedure begins.\nPreferably with a friend to make yourself less conspicuous\nyou amble slowly down the corridors and through the little\nrooms eyeing up the talent. Whilst doing this the first item\nof conversation is, inevitably at I.C., and I quote\n'Not much of it around is there?'\n'No, . . . She's not bad though.'\n'She's with him though. Always the same, ain't it?'\n'Yes,' and so saying another swig is downed.\nPerhaps now comes an interlude for contemplation. Feet\ntapping to the incessant voluminous beat you remain silent,\nwatching the world go by. Faces that are afraid to speak to\nyou or acknowledge you drift stonily past, bathed in grating\nglaring multi coloured fights that illuminate; little punched\ncomputer ticker-tapes twist rhythmically in the breeze of\npeople passing; neon gold and silver posters force themselves\non your gaze.\nEchoes of Paul Simon here, the sounds of silence every-where. For there is no real communication, just chatter. Idle\nchatter that you make and hear, about beer and liquor and\nwomen and hopes for women. Every attempt is made by all\nto get one, that's inevitable; a part of what is called the\nhuman predicament. Carnal knowledge.\nAnd inevitably the girls join in, it takes a fool to realise\nthey are onto a 'good thing'. Yep, everybody plays the game,\nthe pick-up game, in the same sort of way as at an auction.\n36-24-36 says the auctioneer about the lot she is selling,\ntrying to draw as many prospective buyers as possible with\nall available means of attraction. Only in this market place\nthe auctioneer is the lot, and everybody works on that basis.\nSimple, but cold, in an impersonal way.\nAs for me, well I was in the same boat in a way, looking\nfor a girl and I did see one. She had nice eyes. Dark, under-standing, sensitive eyes. But she had met a shy boy, and so,\nunwilling to intrude, I left and wandered around Princes\nGardens. Crunching autumn leaves and watching flickering\nshadows playing in the trees, and dreaming of gaelic girls,\ngrinning, Yours with love, Paranoid.\nThis issue of Felix, the\nnewspaper of Imperial College Union was edited by\nDave Sugden, assisted by Tony Upton, Oily Dawson,\nDave Gribble, Andrew Melvin, Colette Robertson, Ross\nMcBeath, Bernard Williams, and Ron Matthews.

    "content": "Page 8 FELIX Thursday, 21st October, 1971\nThe Film Society did well to invite John Halas (of Halas\nand Batchelor) on Friday night. Mr. Halas' ability to talk on\nthe techniques, history and role in the cinema of animation is\nequalled only by his outstanding ability to produce animated\ncartoons.\nUntil the 1950's most cartoons were synonymous with Walt\nDisney. They mean to most people Tom and Jerry, Mickey\nMouse etc., but there were important elements in these widely\ndistributed and commercialised trivia that Mr. Halas had\nappreciated \u2014 unlike Disney who had completely prostituted\nhis skills to the American Public. Cartoons can exaggerate\nmovement, alter time, emphasise the essential and disregard\nthe superfluous. Music and pictures can be planned together\nand colours chosen with complete freedom. That is: the total\nand absolute control enjoyed by the animator makes his\nmedium one which can put over a message with great force.\nEmotions, beliefs, theories, ideas and characters can all be\ntransmitted and created through a medium that for many\nyears has been grossly under-used.\nUnfortunately it was not possible to show any of Animal\nFarm the film that marked the coming of age of the animated\ncartoon. Not only was this the first full length animated feature film but it was the decisive and radical answer to the\ncommercialised entertainment that emanated from Hollywood.\nThe only film shown that was applauded was Automania\n2000. A frightening picture of man's dependence on scientists, it is brilliantly funny and full of delightful ideas describing how people forced to live in permanent traffic jams would\nin fact get about and be fed and clothed. The sudden shock\nwhen the film ends with an ever-upward swell of cars that\nhave been made self-reproducing, overwhelming the whole\nworld and its controlling scientists leaves me both stunned and\nmoved. The applause was loud and spontaneous. Yet this film\nin its eleven minutes exposes and questions the very beliefs\nbehind the existence of Imperial College\u2014that science is not\nnecessarily going to bring the greatest good to the greatest\nnumber.\nAfter the lecture there was a discussion in the ICR. Possibly the most interesting points of this were Mr. Halas' answers\nto questions on his interpretation of Animal Farm and his\nintentions in producing the film. The reason for the disparity\nbetween the endings of the book and the film is two-fold. It\nwould have made a bad film, Mr. Halas thought, to have\nended it on the final note of the book and also in ending\nthe film with a second revolution, the revolutionary cycle is\nnot only established but maintained. It is only too easy to\ndeduce from reading Animal Farm (as with 1984) that Orwell's book ends without any hope at all\u2014it was after all the\nwork of a man who had lived to see many of his illusions\nshattered in Spain and who was more sensitive than most to\nthe horrific implications of the gap between Communism and\nFascism after the Second World War. But in the film there\nis hope\u2014which Orwell did hint at. The animals in the book\ndo at least look in and see the similarities between pig and\nman, in a way perhaps that on-one saw the similarities between Communism and Facism.\nOne cannot help noticing in all his films Mr. Halas' great\ndelight in certain scenes and pictures for their own sake. The\nfilm based on Hoffnungs drawings about the conductor whose\norchestra played so loud that the Albert Hall fell down is, no\ndoubt, a dig at the arrogance of some musicians. But the\nmain impression is that what matters in the film is the sheer\nfun of the cymbal is t with a bandaged nose, the flautist who\nhangs washing on her flute, the bassoonist with a piccolo\nplayer in his waistcoat pocket, or the percussionist who\nbrains himself with his tubular bells (one could go on for\nages cataloguing the delights of his 'Symphony Orchestra').\nThe main impression that we got, was that of a man com-mitte d. Mr. Halas is commercial in that it would be unrealistic not fake\u2014he must eat\u2014but Halas and Batchelor devote\nto experimental work about three times as much of their income as compared with the film industry's average. He is\nunfailingly modest about his achievements and is appreciative of English audiences. One is glad that his films have had\nthe success they deserve.\nSearch Fees\nIllegal\nAccommodation agencies, some of which have for years\nbeen taking advantage of the sellers' market in flats and bed-sits have at last had some of their worst excesses curbed by\nthe courts. Until this year it was common practice for agencies to charge people looking for accommodation for their\nservices when in statute law they are allowed to charge only\nlandlords; but in a High Court decision last July (Crouch and\nLees v Harridas) it was (at last) ruled that charging people\nlooking for accommodation is illegal.\nAlthough this is an extremely important decision\u2014because\nit means that in theory bills from accommodation agencies\nbecome as valuable and disposable as used loo paper, there\nare (as always with the law) several snags.\nThese are :\n(1) An agency is able to charge a fee in advance, refundable when no accommodation is found. One should not, how-ever, be put off by this as in law this fee is just as refundable\nwhen accommodation is found\u2014as it should never have been\nrequired in the first place. The best thing to do is to pay by\ncheque and then stop the cheque. The agency (once you\nhave a list of addresses) is powerless to retaliate as they have\nno redress in the law.\n(2) Several agencies, realising the drawbacks (to them-selves) of asking for money in advance have started a new\nscheme by which anyone looking for accommodation is required to sign a contract that he will pay a certain sum of\nmoney when accommodation is found. Now, arguably, this is\nnot the kind of fee that was ruled illegal in the High Court.\nIt could possibly be said that it is simply a contract between\ntwo independent parties to both parties' mutual satisfaction.\nEqually, it could be argued that the fee demanded in such a contract is de facto if not de jure a search fee. The contract in\nsuch a situation becomes illegal and unenforceable in the\ncourts. Unfortunately there has not yet been a case clarifying\nthis issue.\nSo this could be anyone's chance to make legal history. It is\nmore than likely that if an agency were to sue for the kind of\nfee described above, the courts would find for the defendant,\nand make the agency pay costs. So if an agency is asking you\nfor money do not pay up. Refuse to pay, complain like hell,\nand go to the union secretary: for the union's solicitor is only\ntoo glad to advise the defendant in what could be an extremely valuable test case, which could quite possibly make looking\nfor accommodation much easier for us all.\nHARASSMENT\nUnfortunately one's troubles are not necessarily over when\none has got accommodation as the following (true) story\nshows\nSomeone (who had better be called X for reasons that will\nbecome apparent at the end of the story) was offered, and\naccepted some unfurnished accommodation. As the rent he\nwas obliged to pay was very high, he went to the Rent Officer\nwho agreed that the rent was excessive and had it reduced to\na 'fair' rent. The landlord then started a campaign of harassment and imposed a midnight curfew on X and told all his\n(Other tenants not to open the door for anyone from inside \u2014\nthus making it impossible for X to enter the building after\nmidnight. The landlord tried to write the curfew into X's rent\nbook but failed.\nSo not only has the landlord broken his contract with X, who has every right to sue him for this but also he is harassing him maliciously which is itself a crime. X has very wisely\ntaken the matter up with the union and their solicitors. The\nmatter rests at the moment. We hope to keep you informed.\nLAM LEY'S A]^[| for your \u2014\nI BOOKS\nEl ART MATERIALS\nI PAPER BACKS\n[ Y1 STATIONERY\n1 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7 Do you want to read books\nby :-Ernest Hemingway\nJames AJdridge\nMarghanita Laski\nAlan Qrury\nMargery gingham\nVladimir Nabokov\nGeorge gli ot Get them from the\nHaldane Library Level 2, Library Block\nOpen Mon. to Fri., 10 \u2014 5.30\nMcLooge\nSpeaks\nThe priorities of this campaign include setting up an\narea lodgings bureau and opposing the Government's policy\non student accommodation.\nAn area lodgings bureau is needed to cater for all students\nin West London. This would have a complete picture of\navailable accommodation and would eliminate competition\nbetween accommodation officers. The UL U lodgings bureau\nwould cease to exist in its present form (dealing only with\nuniversity colleges). But it could form the basis of the new\nlodgings bureau. Accommodation agencies that charge for\ntheir services are one of the evils of the present system, and\nwe are submitting an amendment to the NUS motion on accommodation calling for a concerted anti - accommodation\nagency effort in one urban area. This will involve anti-ac com do mati on agency publicity and legal harrying. We shall also\nbe making widely known the services offered by free student/\ncommunity accommodation agencies. These problems do not\naffect only students and we should be wrong to concentrate\nsolely on getting better facilities for students. By combining\nour claims with those of local communities we shall make\npeople realise that we know that others are worse off than we\nare and we should get more co-operation from local people.\nA lodgings bureau on its own will not solve the problem of\naccommodation. The Robbins report recommended that 66\nper cent of all student accommodation should be provided by\nthe Government. At present an average of 10 per cent is provided for university students\u2014other students are a lot worse\noff. We need a crash programme of new student accommodation but we must also have a say in what type we want and\nwhere we want it built, thus avoiding student ghettoes. The\nIC Board of Governors agrees that an increase in residences is\nneeded before any large increase in student numbers is con-template d; they have put a statement to this effect in their\nfinancial submission for the next five years.\nThe Government has just published a White Paper on accommodation calling for a 'fair rent' concept which will necessitate means-tests and could result in a majority of wage-earners applying for rent rebates. Another point raised is the\npossible de controlling of rents for furnished accommodation.\nMost students live in furnished accommodation and this will\nstrike them particularly hard if it is not opposed. Other more\ncomplex points of the White Paper affect the community as a whole and as such should be considered by the community as\na whole.\nOn a more personal level; if you have any accommodation\nproblems about agencies, landlord harassment or applying to\nthe Rent Tribunal come along to the Union Office and See\nDave Hobman or Will Paulson (Accommodation Officer) who\nwill help you. The Union can also provide free legal advice\non accommodation problems.\n\n"

Outnumber opposition\nBadminton EDITORIAL\nLast year I.C. teams\nprobably had the most successful season ever, winning\nall three U.L. U. Cup com-petitions, with the 1st XI runners-up in the premier\nleague and the 2nd XI winning their league, I.C. maintained their very high Standard in the league competition.\nThis year too, things look\npromising, with more than\none hundred fresher s requesting trials on fresher s' day and a large majority of\nalready experienced I.C. players returning to foster\nthe talents of the fresher s. With such a large number\nof fresher s, it has been very\ndifficult to assess the standards of individuals, but at\nlast teams are beginning to\ntake a reasonable form, and\nwe surely must be looking\nforward to yet another successful season.\nAt the end of last year,\nthree previous I.C. Football\nClub captains left College to\ntake up work in industry.\nWith three players of this\nstandard all leaving at once,\nthe I. C.1st XI has had to\nundergo a little reconstruction and, as yet, the 1st XI has not been a settled team.\nPlayers who are at present\nplaying in the 1st XI have\nto play well in an attempt\nto secure their place and to\ngain the confidence and respect of their fellow team\nmembers. This is also the\ncase in the other teams,\nwhere juggling for positions\ngoes on at an equally intense\nrate.\nHowever, on the first\nmatch day of a new season\nI.C. teams have begun to\nestablish themselves already.\nOn Wednesday, the first of\nthree i teams went to St. Clement Danes, a school with a very high standard of playing ability, and we came\naway victorious from all\nthree pitches.\nThe first eleven, with a team including three fresh-ers won by 2 goals to 1, the\ngoals both coming in the\nfirst half from T. Tibbutt,\na fresher making his debut\nfor the 1st XI and from C Willcock who hit the net\nfrom the penal it y spot. However, with one win under\ntheir belts the firsts have no\ncause to be complacent; at\ntimes their play lacked all\nfluidity and but for the excellent work of N. Bakewell\nin goal and M. Pearson \u2014\nanother fresher\u2014at centre\nhalf\u2014they might not have\nbeen victorious over the\nschoolboys.\nOn this performance,\nthough, the first XI seem set\nfor success this season provided that both the first and\nsecond team members attend\ntraining regularly. Training\nis essential to build the team\nspirit, understanding and fitness which are imperative for\na successful team and indeed,\na successful club.\nAlso, at St. Clement Danes\nthe second XI won 2-1,\nwhilst the third XI dominated their game and ran out\neasy 5-0 victors.\nMeanwhile at Harlington\nI.C. teams entertained our\nclose rivals U.C., but as is\na la ways the case I.C. came\nout firm winners overall, the\nfourth XI winning 5-0, the\nfifths winning 4-2, and the\nsevenths won their game, but\nour only defeat of the day\ncame for the sixth team who\nslumped to a61 defeat.\nOverall these results look\npromising and the season is\nnow well on the way, how-ever, in order that the club\nshould also promote some\nsocial atmosphere we will be\nholding our annual Pie and\nMash Supper next Wednesday, when we hope all club\nmembers will come along so\nthat we can introduce the\nfresher s to a lively and\nfriendly club.\n1st team: N. Bakewell, P. Maslin, C. Acutt, C. Willcock (Capt.), M. Pearson, N. Fryer, P. Willey, P. Bartlett,\nB. Milne, B. Smith, T. Tibbutt.\n1st XV win opening match\nIC l st XV began the season\nin fine style against Avery\nHill College of Education on\nWednesday, 13th October,\nwhen we notched up a score\nof 66 points against weak\nopposition. Although it was\na wet day which made the\nball greasy and difficult to\nhandle, IC always attempted\nto move the ball with appropriate results. The scoring\nwas opened when A.D. Havlin went over in the corner\nfor the first of his five tries,\nA. James converting. Another 12 tries followed during the course of the game,\neven fly-half A. James managing to get one. (His first\ntry ever for IC l st XV).\nScorers were:\nTries: Havlin (5), Hunt\n(2), James (2), McDonough,\nMichael, Pilkington, Hughes.\nConversions: James (7).\nTeam: J. Hughes, J. McDonough, P. Pilkington, A.D. Havlin, J. Hunt, A. James\n(Capt.), C. Flanagan, M. Sugrue, H. Michael, C. Wrigley, R. Mathews, C. Humphries, G. Roberts, I. Partridge,\nA. Tebbett.\nNow that the trials are\nover and most people are\ngaining fitness, the club is beginning to settle down to a new and we hope, successful\nseason. The success of the\nclub depends largely on the\nnew influx of rugby talent,\nsince any college side loses\nmany stalwart members at\nthe end of a year. This year\nagain, about 60 fresher s joined up at the fresher s fair\nand with such an increase in\nmembership it should be possible to field 5 or 6 teams on\na Saturday afternoon.\nWhether we do or not, depends on you and the effort\nand enthusiasm you are prepared to put into the club.\nSo, turn up to training at\n5.30 in the gym on Mondays,\nand remember tick your\nname off on the team lists\nas soon as possible and in\nany case before Friday. The\nFix. Sec. Mike Agg works\nhard throughout the week to\nobtain fixtures for Saturday\nso please turn up, so that all\nhis hard work has not been\nin vain.\nThose of you who think\nthat you deserve a place in a higher team, be patient, because those who are worthy\nof that place will eventually\nget recognised. The best example of this are this year's Captain and Vice Captain\nwho both began last season\nin the A2 team and gradually\nworked their way up.\nNow, a word about the\nclub off the field; on Monday, 25th October, the\nAnnual Pie n' Mash will be\nheld in the Lower Union Refectory and as most of you\nhave paid already you may\nas well turn up at 7.0 p.m. As it is a Monday you can\nwork up a suitable thirst by\ngoing to training before-hand.\nOn November 5th at Harlington, ACC are holding a disco which we hope will go\noff with a bang!! There will\nbe a fireworks display and\na bonfire and since the Rugby Club are doing most of\nthe organising, we hope that\nyou will come and support\nthe venture. Coaches will\nleave from the union, so keep\nan eye on the notice boards\nfor further details.\nDuring the course of the\nyear the club intends playing\na match against the President's( Prof. Sparkes) XV to\ncelebrate the 50th anniversary of the club. The match\nwill be followed by a dinner\nin the Union. Also there will\nbe a foreign tour during\nEaster; probably to France.\nAs you see there's plenty\nto do this year, so train hard,\nplay hard and enjoy your\nrugby at IC both on and off\nthe field.\nAs some of you may or\nmay not remember the badminton club had overwhelming success in the U.L. U. league last season. Along\nwith retaining the Mens I cup for the second year run-ning, the Mixed I brought the\ncup to IC for the first time\nin the listing of the U.L. U. league. Both these events, I might add, were won out-right, that is, not losing to a single college for the past 2\nseasons, a record which I am\ncertain will be equalled this\ncoming season. The Mens II,\nIII, and IV did extremely\nwell by coming 2nd,2 nd,3 rd respectively. With the usual\nproblems of finding regular\nplayers especially in the IV\nteam this was quite an\nachievement.\nGetting on to this season,\nwe have introduced a2nd Mixed team in the U.L. U. league, hopefully with the influx of keen, fit, girl fresher s we shall be able to go from\nthe 3rd division to the 2nd. We have previously had a shortage of girl players, but\nI'm sure this season will see\na change in this.\nWith the relentless efforts\nof the ACC in the guise of\nBill Beauford (ACC Chairman) the authorities have\ngiven us the use of the Great\nHall, along with two Portacourts.\nWednesday afternoons and\nSaturday mornings will be\ntaken up with league match-es, but we have club play\nfrom 1-5 o 'clock in the after-noon. Anyone, whether team\nmember or virtually no ex-peri en ce, male or female or\notherwise are invited to join.\nCoaching will be given to beginners so please come along.\nVive Volleyball\nThe teams finished last\nseason's successful run by\nbeing awarded the Links cup\nfor the most improved club\nin Imperial College. We took\npart in six main competitions\u2014five of these produced medals\u2014three of\nthem first places.\nThere are murmuring s in\nthe air that soon an IC w om en's Volleyball team will\nemerge\u2014we already have\ntwo invitations to play\nmatches but as yet only tentative offers from the 'fairer'\nsex (to play volleyball as\nwell!). Any further enquiries\nshould be addressed to the\nsecretary via Internal mail.\nWill all members (or\nmembers-to-be) please contact the secretary as soon as\npossible. Practices are held\nevery Wednesday (2.30 p.m.), Friday (5.30 p.m.) in the\nunion gym\u2014a Sunday session will be arranged if there\nis sufficient demand.\nVolleyballs to you all!!\nR. Gryg (Secretary).\nAnother session is upon us and Freshers will have been\nconned into paying subscriptions to various clubs. For those\nwho have not paid, it might be noted that sport at I.C. is\nremarkably cheap compared with the cost to play in clubs\noutside college.\nThe standard reached by I.C. sports clubs is very high with\nthe College having teams as good as many of the Universities.\nIn order to maintain these standards a great deal of work has\nto be put in both on and off the field. Captaincy is important\non the field but in college part of the hardest work comes\noutside competition and it is essential that initial enthusiasm\nby captains and members be maintained throughout the year.\nNot only does I.C. cater for the high quality sportsman\nbut there is every opportunity for the average player. You\nare sure to find your level in one of the many teams run\nby each club where you should extract maximum enjoyment\nfrom the sport.\nDuring the summer term the College is plagued by exams\nand lack of Felix yet at this time the cricket and lawn tennis\nclubs are functioning. Last year the tennis club had an\nunfortunate time being upset by the weather and the postal\nstrike! but the captain, Pete Lonnen, has promised that the\nclub will be in existence and active this year. The cricket\nclub was enjoying perhaps its most successful season, winning the ULU cup comfortably and a great deal of credit\nmust go to Russ Smith, the captain.\nWith winter upon us, most of the clubs will be aiming\nto win their respective inter-collegiate UL U cups or leagues.\nLast season the Rugby Club l st XV disappointed themselves\nand the rest of the College by failing at die final hurdle to\nretain the Gutterridge Cup. They set off this season, to\nregain the trophy with a team weakened by the loss of key\nplayers and fresher s scarce \u2014 yet they still have enough\nenthusiasm to pull it off. Meanwhile the Football club has\nsuch a record of achievement that great things are expected\nof them automatically.\nBadminton, Volleyball and Swimming clubs had outstanding success last session and can only look forward with pleasure to the forthcoming competitions. Badminton is now\nplayed in the Great Hall which is not only convenient for\nplayers but spectators as well.\nThe girls at I.C., with so few to choose from, always\nseem to produce a Ladies hockey XI of very high quality\nand this year seems to be no exception. They have already\nwon an early season tournament and we must look forward\nto them regaining the UL U cup.\nGenerally, the feeling amongst the captains is that although they have lost some experienced players, hard work\nand continued support from the members will lead to the\nusual array of trophies being set up for cleaning in the\nUnion.\nThis year there is to be a bonfire at Harlington when the\ngoal posts will be set alight on Friday, November 5th. There\nwill be coaches to the event, the cost of which will be included in the entry ticket.\nTen Bowling\nThe Ten Pin Bowling Club is a relatively young club\ncompared to some of the other, more established Imperial\nCollege clubs, however over the years a small nucleus of\nkeen members have managed to build this club into a lively\nweekly gathering of both sexes. Meetings are held every\nWednesday at the Airport Bowl, near Heathrow, and a coach\nleaves the Union Arch at 1.30.\nThe activities are not restricted to Wednesday bowling, as\nevery weekend three five-man and one women's team bowl in\nthe University Ten Pin Bowling League. Up to now we have\ncollected a few medals, but always seem to settle somewhere\nnear the bottom of the league table, probably due to the\ngrants running out at the end of term. This year free tuition\nis available, and for this I should like to mention the\nmanager of the Bowl who has been very accommodating up\nto present. The bowling rate has been reduced this year to\n25p for a three-game series.\nAn internal league will soon be established so I would\nadvise anyone considering joining the club to come along at\nthe earliest opportunity, in order to take full advantage of\nthe tuition which will be available for the first few weeks.\nWomen are especially invited to attend as this sport is not\nrestricted to the male student population. Further information can be obtained from the Secretary, Dave Griffen, Tizard\n436.\nK. CRUMPLER, Captain (Maths II)\n\n"
