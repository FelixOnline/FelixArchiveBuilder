    "content": "Herman Hesse, the German novelist and poet,\nwandered for some time through the Swiss\ncountryside \u2013 and wrote as a result the aptly\nnamed Wandering. His book is about many\nthings, one of them being a communion\nwith nature. Hesse tells his reader \u201cTrees are\nsanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to\nthem, whoever knows how to listen to them,\ncan learn the truth\u201d and these words resounded with especial strength throughout the two\nhours spent at David Hockney\u2019s new show at\nthe Royal Academy of Arts. For the creation\nof the new works exhibited in A Bigger Picture, Hockney has not strayed from his native\nYorkshire, painting the forests and fields near\nhis home. Nevertheless, the concept of unity\nwith nature and the natural world in his painting is readily observed.\nA Bigger Picture (a reference to Hockney\u2019s\nfamous \u2018A Bigger Splash\u2019) is an exhibition on\na massive and grand scale. There is a retrospective aspect \u2013 some early work, such as the\n1980s photo-collages of the Grand Canyon, is\nincluded \u2013 that succeeds because, despite its\nbrevity, it chronicles with clarity the development of Hockney\u2019s landscapes to their present\nstate. However its onus is on the landscape\npaintings, watercolours and \u2018iPad\u2019 drawings\nof recent years as well as sketchbooks and\none extraordinary video installation.\nHockney has assimilated and collated the\ndetails of nature to astonishing effect: the\ngrandiose, whispering trees in \u2018Woldgate\nWoods 26, 27 and 30 July 2006\u2019 are just\nthat because of the dark blue colour running\nthroughout the painting and the tiny leaves\nflung against a grey sky, virtually carried\nby a breeze. It must surely be that Hockney\nexperiences a different reality to us; it is one\nso concretely understood however, that his\nYorkshire landscapes, almost by obligation,\nepitomize nature. Nature, its essence, is confidently expressed such that reality is almost\naugmented; the landscapes could even be\nviewed as an improvement (at least within the\nconfines of the RA!) on Yorkshire itself.\nThe same scenes recur, depicted at different\ntimes in the same season or year. The landscape that greets visitors to the exhibition is\nshown in spring, summer, autumn and winter.\nHockney\u2019s knowledge of this particular view\nis all-encompassing, as is his understanding\nof how hawthorn blossoms or of the elements\ncomposing the \u2018tree tunnel\u2019 he has studied.\nPerhaps greatest in scope is the collective\n\u2018The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate Woods\u2019,\ncomposed of 51 iPad drawings following the\nbudding Yorkshire spring, the final blooming\nof which is culminated by an immense oil\npainting.\nThe naturalism of A Bigger Picture is somewhat countered by the use of new technolo-gies, placing Hockney\u2019s work definitively in\nHockney\u2019s biggest\nsplash yet?\nthe 21st century. The iPad drawings are just\nhis first forage into technology; the film installation is a technical feat but also complements the oil landscapes by taking the \u2018augmented\u2019 reality a step further. There are two\nphases, the first taking place in a colourful,\nbright room in which separate cameras were\nused to film the movements of ballet danc-ers. The images were then collaged, con-torted, resulting in a different perspective\nof reality, reminiscent of the Grand Canyon\ncollages. The second phase is comprised of\nseveral slow motion films of the Yorkshire\ncountryside. These were filmed using nine\ncameras mounted on a moving van, each\ncamera capturing a slightly different area\nof the landscape. The effect is hypnotic; the\ncombination of almost imperceptible movement and collaged images results in a novel\ncountryside, one that could be representative\nof nature everywhere.\nHockney\u2019s work seems to advocate a return\nto nature and form in art. Although this may\nnot sound appealing to the lover of minimalism for example, Hockney\u2019s landscapes are of\nsuch quality that one cannot fail to be moved.\nFor nature-starved Londoners especially,\nthis may be an opportunity to experience the\ncountryside, and its (ideally) therapeutic ef-fects, without ever having to leave the city. If\nonly for this reason, it is an exhibition which\nshould not be missed and which surely confirms David Hockney as one of the great British contemporary artists.\nDavid Hockney: A Bigger Picture at The\nRoyal Academy of Arts until April 9\nFELIX\nFriday 27 january 2012\n22\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts Editors: Will Prince\nEva Rosenthal\nARTS\nThe Poet\u2019s Column\nPassage of Rhyme\nby Pavitar Devgon\nA top the world sits a bubbling spring\nWhere white lilies grow and nightingales sing\nHere snow slowly falls; the air is so thin\nWhence water outflows and then it begins.\nThe mountainous creek runs down the slope swift\nWaterfalls pouring to crash upon drift\nFleeing fast from the fraught cold of the cliff\nWinding its way to the arbourous rift\nBetween the trees, quenching soil and life\nFulfilling their needs while bearing their strife\nArriving where dwell both sparsely and rife\nWhistling on like sweet flute and shrill fife\nIt flows further fore and happens a lake\nStreaming in all it has learned upon wake\nTaking all given, it gives all it takes\nSoon sliding onward the sinuous snake\nThe marshland, it wanes and salinates flows\nCordgrass and Juncus breed; nothing else grows\nThe delta drinks rivers, this we all know\nThe water here rages; here the wind blows\nThe blue river\u2019s journey finally ends\nAmid ocean torrents, global heat trends\nCascading and tumbling in the sea\nThe cycle completed, now Avanti!\n\u201cHockney\u2019s work advocates a return to nature\nand form in art\u201d\nEva Rosenthal\nDavid Hockney mixes traditional and modern mediums\nto recreate Yorkshire landscapes of dazzling colour\nThe Politician\u2019s Fingernails\nby Kadhim Shubber\nAre my fingernails too long?\nThey look ok... head up, stop looking at them\n(smile!)\nThey feel kind of long.\nThere.

    "content": "New milestones reached in\nfight against Alzheimer\u2019s\nPhilip Kent looks at the latest Alzheimer\u2019s research\nBinding of proteins to nanobodies causes a change of capacitance\nA\nlzheimer\u2019s is an as-yet incurable disease that accounts for\nthe majority of cases of de-mentia. A characteristic symptom of people with Alzheimer\u2019s is memory loss, with the person affected\ngradually becoming increasingly forgetful;\nunable to remember their own identity, and\neventually, complete unresponsiveness in\nits later stages. This is amongst many other\nsymptoms.\nA common misconception is that Alzheimer\u2019s is a genetic disorder. Whilst there are\nmany cases where a malformed chromosome\ncan cause the disease to develop (often in\nearlier ages than other sufferers), this only\naccounts for very few cases. Scientists are\ncurrently unsure on the exact causes of the\nmajority of the cases, which generally develop after the age of 65.\nThis is an incredibly saddening thing to\nhappen to anyone, but luckily two new pieces\nof research may help in the quest to find a\ncure for this disease.\nDetection\nIn the minority of cases, Alzheimer\u2019s is\ncaused by genetics, making it hard to identify whether a person will suffer in later\nlife. Current techniques involve a number of\ntests (which also ensure that the patient has\nAlzheimer\u2019s, and not a different form of de-mentia); but before these tests are done, deterioration to the patient\u2019s mind, as well as a\nproactive step of actually going to the doctor,\nmust already have taken place. Luckily these\ntests have up to 90% accuracy.\nHowever, new research from the United\nStates can help to improve both the time and\naccuracy of detection. This works through\nuse of a biosensor, a device that interfaces\nbetween biological and electrical systems.\nWhen the compound under investigation reacts with the biosensor on its catalytic zone,\nan electrical signal is generated that can be\ninvestigated.\nIn this development by a team lead by\nShalini Prasad from the University of Texas,\na biosensor has been developed that can measure the concentration of a number of proteins which have been linked to diseases such\nas Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. These proteins bind onto nanobodies (not dissimilar to\nantibodies), causing a change in capacitance\nin an electrical layer. Prasad\u2019s team found\nthat the change in capacitance is linked to the\nconcentration of the antibody under investi-gation.\nThese proteins build up in fluid that surrounds the brain, which can be extracted and\nanalysed. The extracted fluid is applied to the\nbiosensor, which can detect even very small\nconcentrations of the problematic proteins.\nFELIX\nFriday 27 january 2012\n10\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nIn brief\n\u2018Extinct\u2019 monkey rediscovered in\nBorneo\nDeep in a forest in Borneo, researchers have found\nwhat they thought was an extinct species of monkey\ncalled Miller\u2019s grizzled langur.\nAs late as last year, researchers thought that the\nelusive monkeys were extinct. But this has changed\nnow that PhD student Simon Fraser accidentally\ncaught a group of the langurs on camera, which he\nhad originally set up on a time lapse to try to get a\nglimpse of another rare animal, the Bornean clouded\nleopard. The photographs were taken in the Wehea\nForest of East Kalimantan last June.\nIt was a challenge for the researchers to confirm\nthe identity of the monkeys once they had spotted\nthem in the images, because so few photographs of\nthem exist. In the end, the researchers had to resort\nto descriptions from museum specimens.\nIn recent years, the langurs have had 95% of their\nhabitat destroyed by logging, agricultural enroach-ment, coal mining and fire.\nKelly Oakes\nLolcats? Owls? Let me introduce the lolgur\nM\u00f6bius\nby Maria Veiga\nThis is an improvement over existing methods \u2013 Prasad told the RSC\u2019s Chemistry World\nthat they aren\u2019t as sensitive. With the old\nmethods, it isn\u2019t possible to detect whether\na patient is likely to suffer from Alzheimer\u2019s\n(or Parkinson\u2019s) from such an early stage.\nSo far, scientists have only tested samples\nof the fluid obtained post-mortem, but thanks\nto the high sensitivity of the new technique,\ndetection in samples obtained during the\nearly stages of Alzheimer\u2019s looks to be a\npossibility. Prasad\u2019s team hopes to take part\nin clinical trials, which should give an indication as to how well it works as an early\nindicator.\nPrevention\nDrugs are available which slow down the\nprogression of the disease, which means that\npeople diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s can still\nenjoy a good quality of life for a longer time\n\u2013 and this is only aided by early detection\nthat may be made possible by this research.\nHowever, a drug to stop the development of\nthe disease does not yet exist.\nA new research project undertaken jointly\nby the Universidad de Antioquia in Colombia, and the Banner Institute from the United\nStates may go some way to changing this.\nThis study involves a group of people who\nare likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s, with drugs\ntrials seeing if the progression of the disease\ncan be stopped.\nThese subjects, of which there are 500, all\noriginate from the Antioquia region of Colombia, and are all likely to develop the disease due to a genetic mutation. One of the\nresearchers, Francisco Lopera, stresses that\n\u201cwhat is useful in treatment and prevention\nof neurodegenerative disorders will be useful\nto those suffering from sporadic Alzheimer\u2019s\nas well\u201d.\nThe subjects in this study are analysed using a PET scanner. A tracer is injected into\nthe subject, where it travels to the brain and\nbinds to the same protein in Prasad\u2019s work.\nTherefore, the image built from the radiation\nreleased gives a very good image of the areas\nof the brain containing the protein.\nThe group has also got a set of drug candidates from previous tests in rats. After obtaining clinical approval, these drugs can be\ninjected into the subjects, then retested via\nthe PET scanner after a couple of years to\nsee if the drug is effective in preventing the\ndevelopment of the proteins. This means that\nit is relatively quick to obtain a set of candidate drugs.\nThis method can also find drugs for other\ndiseases, including Parkinson\u2019s and Huntington\u2019s. In addition to this, by analysing\nsubjects who are in further stages of the dis-ease, it may be possible to find drugs that\nstop or reverse the buildup of proteins. The\ngroup intends to do research in this area, as\nthe massive trial being undertaken will yield\nimmense amounts of useful information on\nhow Alzheimer\u2019s develops, and how drugs\naffect it. If a prevention drug is found, it can\nbe given to subjects who will develop Alzheimer\u2019s (by virtue of their genetics), and\nthey can then be tested via this technique in\ntheir later years to see if the disease has been\nprevented.\n\n"

    "content": "T\nhree out of four secondary school students are\nnot taught physics by a\nspecialist physics teacher.\n16% of those eligible for\nschool meals make it to university.\nIndependent schools, however, manage to send 96% of theirs to higher\neducation. These points are raised by\nTeach First (whose mission is to address educational disadvantage and\nwho have been active around Imperial\nrecently). Their solution? Train as a\nteacher yourself. If enough individuals who are physics graduates become\nteachers, the problem will be solved.\nNow, it\u2019s been said society has three\nessential facets. One, to provide food\nand shelter so individuals can survive.\nTwo, to bear and rear children to replace the dead. And three, to educate,\nresearch and to achieve progress so\nthat the next generation is better and\nsmarter than everything that came\nbefore it. The first two of these tasks\nhave been done by animals for billions of years, but the third is done\nonly by humans in the last 400 years\nor so since rediscovery of ancient\nGreek civilization. It led to the invention of the telescope, microscope and\nair pump, and gave rise to the idea of\nPigs \u2013 our friends and maybe our equals\nLearn to think better of teaching\nmass education. Virtually all our society\u2019s progress comes from these last\nfour centuries. In light of this, it could\nbe convincingly argued that the job of\na teacher, who educates children, is\none of the most important and worthwhile jobs possible.\nYet when I look closer at what the\nreality of being a teacher entails, I see\na pay freeze for the next four years at a\ntime when inflation has reached 5%. I\nsee their pensions under attack. Micromanagement, bureaucracy and overwork erode their work-life balance. At\nleast office temps don\u2019t have to take\ntheir work home with them. Teachers also suffer a lack of respect from\nthe ill-informed, who think they finish\nwork at 3pm and do nothing in school\nholidays. Furthermore, I see the school\nbuilding project cancelled, religious\ngroups invited to take over the running of schools (Education Secretary\nMichael Gove was forced to deny they\nwould teach creationism) and market\nforces being introduced to education\n(don\u2019t get why this is bad? Imagine if\naccess to education was as unevenly\ndistributed as income).\nThere is a reason for all this, the\nmainstream press will be quick to tell\nus: the debt. In 2008, several large fiG\netting home one day, I\nwas met with an unwel-come, albeit familiar,\nsight. The living room\nlooked like a bomb had\ngone off and the rubble had been picked\nover by looters. In the kitchen, scores of\nmice were defending the ceramic mountain range by the sink from an amorphous and strangely sentient fungus. I\ndared not step into the bathroom \u2013 from\nwhat I could see, I didn\u2019t know whether\nto call a professional cleaner or an exor-cist. Faced with this special circle of hell,\nthere was only conclusion I could reach:\nI\u2019m living with pigs!\nOn reflection, this might not be quite\nthe hyperbolic statement that it appears\nto be. We may be most closely related\nwith chimps, but we share much in common with our barnyard friends.\nMedically, we have much to owe the\npig. Before E. coli and human DNA got\ndrunk together at a party in 1977, most\ninsulin came from pigs \u2013 for which\ndiabetics of the world rejoice. And unless the law making motorcycle helmets\ncompulsory is repealed or stem cells actually prove themselves useful for some-thing, we can fund the deficit in organ\ndonors with a little help from our porcine pals. Pig hearts, sow livers, bacon\nkidneys \u2013 these things need not sound as\ndaft as they do.\nAlthough, in the interests of balance,\nmaybe we should start making human\nsuede and human bacon? That brings me\nonto another point of similarity. Human\nmeat tastes most like pork\u2026 so I have\nbeen told. In the language of the Marquesas Islands of Polynesia, the word for\nhuman translates as Long Pig. However,\nthe semantics ties itself in knots when\nthe word for pig translates as Short Human. The words for all other animals are\na specified number of chickens in a coat.\nThe word for chicken is some kind of\nvegetable, I believe.\nReligion has tended to have a dim\nview of pigs. They\u2019ve always been\nseen as dirty, greedy, unclean animals,\nnot quite kosher, quite haraam. I don\u2019t\nwant to get into any theological debates\nhere (goodness knows Comment loves\nthem!) but it seems to me that pigs are\nthe scapegoat (scape-pig?) for the nature\nof an animal that doesn\u2019t walk with cloven feet, but does speak with a cloven\ntongue and thinks with a cloven mind.\nPigs have borne this misrepresentation\nwith characteristic good humour.\nPigs have given us so much, from\nfood to medicine, with so many charming phrases along the way. In return, we\nhave not been so generous. Apart from\nthe occasional lovelorn chap who marries a pig, we have consistently taken\nwithout giving back. Given our intimate\nrelationship with our porcine cousins,\nthis is categorically wrong. So, what\ncan we do to redress this imbalance?\nOffer them some rashers of Danish bacon made with real Danes? Or at least\na selection of chickens in an overcoat.\nMaybe we should donate our kidneys en\nmasse as a gesture of reparation? Maybe\nnot. I can\u2019t speak for you, but I\u2019m using\nmine at the moment.\nnancial institutions were on the verge\nof bankruptcy and managed to convince the New Labour government to\ntransfer their private debts onto the\npublic balance sheet, with no strings\nattached. The banks got an excellent\ndeal; teachers got sold out. This debt\nhad to be paid off, so all political parties started talking about how much\nthey\u2019d cut, by how much they\u2019d reduce\npublic sector salaries and pensions,\nand how much teachers would be economically punished for the mistakes\nSamuel L. Jackson in Coach Carter, can a motherlover say awesome,\ninspirational teacher up in here?\n... it could be\nconvincingly\nargued that the\njob of a teacher...\nis one of the most\nimportant and\nworthwhile jobs\npossible\n\u201d\njobs\njob\n\u201c\n... it co\n... it co\nconvinc\nconvinc\nand greed of the top 1%.\nThe goals of Teach First are noble\nindeed, but I can\u2019t help thinking education might be better if they joined\nan anti-austerity group. Teach First\ntells us to each solve the problem indi-vidually, but they forget we have much\nmore power collectively when we\nwork together. History and experience\ndemonstrates this. With better working\nconditions and benefits, good teachers\nwill naturally become attracted to the\nprofession.\nOne option that would be for the benefit of everyone would be to give pigs\nflying lessons. Microlights, biplanes,\nBoeing 747s; it doesn\u2019t matter. We could\ntransform the phrase, \u201cwhen pigs fly\u201d\nfrom a cynical scoff at a far-fetched idea\nto simply a measure of time. If pigs could\nfulfill their dreams, what would stop you\nfrom yours?

This week, Hockey club\ncaptain Jason Ye meets up with me in\n568 to discuss all things relevant to a\nwooden stick and a small hard ball.\nIntroductions out of the way, I ask Jason how long he\u2019s been playing hockey\n\u2013 he looks pretty sharp in his blazer and\nhockey tie, and is obviously no newcomer to the sport. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing\nfor ten or eleven years now, picked it\nup at school when I was eleven and\nhaven\u2019t stopped since!\u201d\nSuch dedication to the sport has led\nhim to take up the mantle of club captain in his final year. He\u2019s happy to tell\nme more about the workings of the\nclub, and the team structure. \u201cThere are\nabout 90 people in the club. We have\nfour men\u2019s teams and two women\u2019s\nteams, as well as a mixed team. They\nplay in both BUCS and ULU leagues,\nand currently the men\u2019s 1s are in the\nSoutheast 1A division, just below the\npremiership, while the ladies 1s are in\nSoutheast 2A.\u201d\nI ask him what the aims for theeis\nseason are. Any hopes of promotion?\n\u201cActually, the ladies 1s have had it\ntough for the past few years, constantly\nfinishing second of their league! They\nhave a new coach this year who is really experienced, especially on the\nplayer development side. It came down\nto a single match last year, but this year\nthey\u2019re top of their league so far, so\nlet\u2019s see what happens.\u201d\nJason tells me the Mens 1s were promoted last year, but are having a tough\ntime in the league above. \u201cResults are\npicking up, though\u201d. he says, \u201chopefully they\u2019ll be able to make a stand\u201d\n(and presumably avoid re-relegation).\nThe club captain himself plays with\nthe seconds, although he says that the\nteams are not fixed: \u201cWe try to have the\nbest people for each game. It depends\non how people are doing in training,\nhow they\u2019ve been playing in the past\nfew matches.\u201d\nSpeaking of training, I ask him how\nit is set up. Any famous coaches, like\nrubgy? \u201cWe go up to Harlington every\nMonday, and operate a pitch rotation\npolicy. The 1s and 2s train together,\nand come out half an hour before the\nothers. We try and make it so that everyone has equal amounts of time to\npractice. As far as coaches go, we have\none for the ladies, one for the mens 1s\nand 2s, and last term an ex-club captain\ncame along to coach the 3s and 4s. We\nactually got the Engand goalkeeping\ncoach to come down for two specialist\nsessions, though, which was amazing.\u201d\nOur 1st XI have nothing to envy the\nfirst XV, then.\nAt this point I have to confess that\nI knew little about hockey beforehand,\nand while it may seem a bit presump-tuous, I don\u2019t think that many readers\nknow an awful lot about it either. Jason\ngladly fills me in, though, when I ask\nhim about hockey in England. \u201cpretty\nmuch every town has a club; I\u2019d say\nthere are more than a thousand in\nEngland alone. It\u2019s not actually a professional sport, but players in the top\npremier league teams do get paid \u2013 I\nthink you can earn about \u00a340K a year,\nwhich isn\u2019t bad!\u201d Curious, I ask about\nthe top uni teams: \u201cWell, obviously\nthere\u2019s Loughborough, [Reigning multiple BUCS champions who also play\nin the English Hockey Premier League\n\u2013 Ed.], and you also have Birmingham,\nBrunel, Exeter, Cardiff...we\u2019re trying\nto break into that circle, and maybe\nover the next five to ten years, get promoted into the premiership.\u201d\nCompetition aside, hockey seems\nto be one of the more socially active\nclubs, and I get Jason to fill me in on the\ngoings-on off the pitch: \u201cI think one of\nthe great things about the hockey club\nis the fact that we are a mixed club \u2013\nthere are lots of social aspects that, say,\nrugby or football miss out on by actually having two separate clubs. We all\nknow each other, and even if we don\u2019t\nplay in the same teams, we might have\na post-match drink, or a get-together.\nThere\u2019s a really good club spirit.\n\u201cWe also organise a number of so-cials, including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 a\nfresher\u2019s meal (complete with mums,\ndads, and incest), a fresher\u2019s tour, a\nChristmas dinner and an annual black\ntie dinner.\u201d\nThat much is clear, then \u2013 no shortage of opportunities to enjoy yourself\nin the hockey club! Jason adds that\naround thirty people go on tour every\nsummer for with previous destinations\nincluding India, Malaysia and Eastern\nEurope. This year it\u2019s Portugal \u2013 not\na country one would immediately associate with hockey, but Jason assures\nme that there are clubs everywhere:\n\u201cthere are quite a few teams in Lisbon,\nand also in the south of Portugal.You\nhave to find the teams\u201d, he says, but\nthey will be there!\u201d Finally, with Varsity approaching (yes, it\u2019s already that\ntime of year) I ask the captain about\nthe club\u2019s approach to the whole thing:\n\u201cWe take it very seriously. Last year,\nthe mens 1s won in an extremely tight\nmatch; so did the ladies 1s. The mens\n2s lost, unfortunately, so we\u2019re hoping to take our revenge. Traditionally,\nIC are stronger at hockey though \u2013 the\nmens 1s have never lost Varsity\u201d Is he\nlooking forward to it? \u201cIt\u2019s a whole day\nwith five matches at Harlington, starting at 9...and the atmosphere is great!\nDrinking port on the sidelines or stealing the medics\u2019 chicken head are part\nand parcel of the experience too.\u201d\nI wish him luck for the next game, and\nfor Varsity \u2013will they remain unbeaten?\nSport Editor\nIndy Leclercq\nEssential info:\nJason Ye, 21\n1.70 m, 70 kg\n4th Year Computer Science\n11 years playing hockey, currently on 2nd team\nLikes: the Tree of Woe\nDislikes: crashing the Union minibus\nIndy Leclercq\n1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8\n9 10 11 10\n11 12 13\n14\n13 15 14 15 16\n17\n17 19 18 19 21 20\n22\n20 21 24 22 23\n25\n24 25 27\n26 29\n12 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21\n22 23 24 25\n26\n20\n26\n28\n23\n18\n16\n15\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nFELIX Friday 27 january 2012 23\nEnter the Zarina\nEmotions run high at film artist and photographer\nZarina Bhimji\u2019s retrospective at Whitechapel\nMargot Pikovsky\nTo coincide with the world premiere of\nher latest film installation \u2018Yellow Patch\u2019,\nthe Whitechapel Gallery in East London is currently showing the first major\nretrospective of the artwork of Zarina\nBhimji. Born in Uganda to Indian par-ents, Bhimji left for Britain in the early\n1970s to escape the brutal regime of Idi\nAmin. This complex cultural history cannot help but heavily influence her work,\nand partly explains her passionate focus\non themes of loss, pain, and human dis-placement.\nThe exhibition opens with some of\nBhimji\u2019s earlier work, a collection of\nphotographs from her series, \u2018Love\u2019.\nTaken on her visits back to Uganda, the\nphotographs capture with vivid and harsh\nintensity the scenes of decay and abandonment she finds there. In one, an enormous chandelier lies disused, dominating\nthe tiny room it now inhabits as the bright\nlight refracting through its glass hints at\nthe awe it would have once inspired. In\nanother, a family home, bathed in warm\nsunlight, sits derelict and empty, poignant\ndue to the obvious, aching absence of the\nfamily who once lived there. This idea, of\nplaces now empty where there once was\nsuch a strong human presence, echoes\nthroughout the collection, from the\nmountain of abandoned paperwork that\nfills up one image, each file the ghost of\na person now forgotten, to the mysterious\nbag of hypodermic syringes that invades\nand taints the image of an otherwise bar-ren, natural scene. It is with great talent\nthat Bhimji manages to somehow capture\nthe intense beauty in such desolate and\nemotive moments.\nThe climax of the exhibition, the greatly anticipated \u2018Yellow Patch\u2019, results\nfrom Bhimji\u2019s journey further into her\nown past, to India, the home of her par-ents. In my eyes it was far less successful.\nWhere \u2018Love\u2019 was subtle yet expressive,\nthe film installation seemed simultaneously painfully obvious and frustratingly\nabstract. Repetitive close up shots of\nderelict buildings and abandoned objects\ngained little from the disjointed sounds\nthat accompanied them, and offered none\nof the personality and the evidence of humanity that her earlier photographs captured so well. Brief moments of beauty\nor interest, such as the looming wreck of\nan unfinished ship, were utterly desen-sitised by the slow and passive movement of the camera that panned across\nthem. On some intellectual level, I was\nintrigued by some of the more unusual\nimages, and I appreciated the occasional\ncontrast between the bustling movement\ncaptured in the audio against the total\nstillness of the visual. But I was utterly\nunable to connect emotionally with the\ninstallation. I found myself yearning for\nsome kind of narrative to pull me through\nit, a connecting thread that I sensed was\nthere but could not cling on to as image\nafter image slid before my eyes. Perhaps\nI\u2019m simply not emotionally intelligent\nenough to personally respond to such a\nrestrained piece \u2013 but if that\u2019s the case,\nthen is it really good art?\nI found myself similarly unappreciative of the two other smaller collections\non display, \u2018Cleaning the Garden\u2019 and\n\u2018She Loved to Breathe \u2013 Pure Silence\u2019.\n\u2018Cleaning the Garden\u2019, one of Bhimji\u2019s\nearlier collections, apparently contrasting English and Spanish traditions of formal gardening, seemed to me to have no\nstrong central theme or message, providing aesthetically pleasing but ultimately\nimpersonal photographs. Meanwhile,\n\u2018She Loved to Breathe\u2019 came across as\nuncharacteristically unsubtle, with an\narguably unnecessary addition of chilli\nand turmeric scattered on the floor beneath what on their own were powerful\nand cleverly composed images, abstractly referring to the trauma of Asian immigrant women in the UK forced to submit\nto virginity tests in the 1970s.\nDespite these criticisms, I\u2019d still recommend the exhibition, even if only for\n\u2018Love\u2019. The emotive power and haunting beauty of some of that collection is\nundeniable, and as for the others... Well,\nperhaps I just didn\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 them.\nZarina Bhimji at the Whitechapel\nGallery until March 9\n\u2018Your Sadness is Drunk\u2019. My drunkness is horny like Newt Gingrich in an open relationship\nTake a gawk on\nthe wild side\nIf labs and essay deadlines have so far\nprevented you from paying a visit to the\nNatural History Museum and you\u2019re\nlooking for an excuse to get out of the\nlibrary: forget the dinosaurs, forget the\nmassive blue whale and forget the Kobe\nearthquake room, because if there\u2019s\none exhibition that you actually have\nto make it to between now and March\n11th this is it: Wildlife Photographer of\nthe Year.\nThe NHM and BBC Wildlife have\nbeen organising and collaborating on\nthe competition every year since 1964,\nwhen a humble 600 submissions were\nreceived for just 3 categories. This\nyear\u2019s panel of judges were faced with\nmore than 40,000 entries from all round\nthe world; proof of just how prestigious\nthe competition has become over the\nlast half century.\nAnyone coming to this exhibition\nexpecting cutesy animal snaps is soon\nconverted: the ensemble is such a vibrant celebration of the fusion of man\u2019s\ncreativity and the glory of nature, technical prowess, and artistic flair that it\u2019s\nhard not to lose yourself and let go of\nthe outside world for several hours.\nThe exhibition is more than a collection of pretty pictures though: some\nphotos will leave you bewildered, others shocked, impressed or dumb-struck.\nThe overwhelming feeling by the end\nhowever is a deep respect for the photographers and a profound inspiration to\ngo home and create something magical\nof your own. At the very least, the exhibition reminds us of how to marvel at\nthe beauty of nature: the intricate detail\nin a tern\u2019s wings as it prepares to land\non water, the staggering Milky Way\nstretching nonchalantly over the horizon\nat night or the sheer audacity of a mountain goat, several thousand feet in the air\ncommitting a death-defying feat just to\nreach a mineral lick (one of my personal\nfavourites \u2013 \u2018Balancing Act\u2019).\nWith outstanding contributions in\nmany different categories and by many\ndifferent participants (a particular mention goes to the 11-14 Years Old con-testants, whose work easily equalled\nin brilliance those of their more senior\nrivals) it is a small wonder that a winner could be picked at all. Still, Daniel\nBeltra of Spain proudly takes home the\ntitle this year for his thought-provoking\n\u2018Still Life in Oil\u2019: a portrait of a group of\npelicans drenched in crude oil. Despite\nmy initial reservations about the win\ndue to its political nature, I was oddly\ntouched by the beautifully tragic composition and almost palpable fear of the\nbirds. In the winner\u2019s words and as a\nperfect summary of the competition as a\nwhole: \u201cI wanted to create a set of images that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in an\nart gallery [...] it\u2019s a route to understanding that doesn\u2019t depend on shock. I think\nit gets the message to a wider audience,\nbecause if the image is aesthetically ap-pealing, people are more likely to stop.\u201d\nSeriously, don\u2019t take my word for it:\njust go see.\nWildlife Photographer of the Year at\nthe Natural History Museum until\nMarch 11\n\u201cAnyone coming to\nthis exhibition expecting cutesey animal\nsnaps is converted\u201d\n\u201cThe emotive power\nand haunting beauty\nis undeniable\u201d\nAahh, mate, aah, mate, aaaaahh, maaate, I\u2019m bugging out so bad here\nArianna Sorba\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX Friday 27 january 2012 9\nA\nrecent flurry of articles\nexpounding the effects of\nthe current mild winter on\nthe natural world serves\nto remind us of the consequences of climate change, but do these\nexamples contain any scientific mean-ing, or are they merely interesting, if\nforeboding, anecdotal tidbits?\nSpring flowers such as hazel catkins,\nsnowdrops, and daffodils, traditionally\nexpected in late January or early February, have been seen across the UK from\nas early as Christmas Day. Hedgehogs\nand other hibernating mammals such\nas bats have been active in defiance of\ntheir normal winter tactics, whilst red\nadmiral butterflies have been taking\nadvantage of the almost balmy climate.\nEven the birds and the bees are following suit by living up to their eponymous\nphrase earlier than in previous years,\nwith robins singing, wood pigeons rearing young, and buff-tailed bumblebees\nmanaging to emerge uncharacteristically early.\nKeeping records of such phenological\nevents is entrenched in British tradition.\nRecords of the first cuckoo of spring or\nthe first leafing dates of trees have been\nkept for hundreds of years. Data such as\nthis can prove useful in providing evidence for the effects of anthropogenic\nclimate change on individual species or\ngroups. For instance, it has been shown\nthat since 1939 UK birds such as the\nwren have been steadily breeding ear-lier. Countless examples of phenologi-cal advances such as this can be found\nacross a diverse range of organisms, but\ncan they advance our understanding of\nthe deeper biological implications of\nclimate change on ecosystems?\nWhen taken in isolation, the answer is\nnot really. A 2005 paper by Dutch scientists Visser and Both acknowledged\nthe fact that on its own, evidence of\nphenological advances could illustrate\ncontrasting climate change impacts.\nPositive if the advances were evidence\nof adaptation to climate change, or negative if that species was becoming increasingly out of synchronisation with\nits environment. The latter cannot be\nknown unless data also exists for other\nimportant species with which it inter-acts, for instance we cannot know if an\nadvance in flowering date is beneficial\nor detrimental to a given plant unless\nwe know whether or not its insect pol-The phenological fallacy\nlinator has also advanced. The point is a\n\u2018yardstick\u2019 by which to judge the potential impact of a phenological shift on a\nspecies is needed.\nWhilst this may seem obvious, more\ncryptically it has also been shown that\nthe use of these \u2018firsts\u2019 is fundamentally\na poor indicator on which to judge the\neffects of climate change on a species.\nGranted, the \u2018first\u2019 cuckoo of spring has\nbeen getting earlier and earlier, but this\ndata alone tells us nothing about what\nthe rest of the population is doing. It\nwould be much more informative, according to Jean-Pierre Moussus and\ncolleagues, to use the mean date of a\nphenological event to analyse and predict the effects of climate change on a\npopulation.\nUnfortunately phenological data for\nmany individuals in a population is a\nrare luxury, let alone equivalent data\nfor the species with which they inter-act. Many researchers however, unlike\nsome species to climate change, are\nadapting to this way of thinking and\nare designing experimental systems ac-cordingly, with the aim of painting a\nmore complete picture of the impacts of\nclimate change.\nChristopher Nichols on why the first cuckoo of spring doesn\u2019t necessarily tell us much\nA new genomic sequencing method\nhas been put into practice by Professor\nFranklin Pugh and graduate student Ho\nSung Rhee, after development in Penn\nState University. The method, known as\nChIP-exo, gives us an insight into the\nproteins that read and regulate chromosomes (transcription preinitiation com-plexes, or PICs) and was detailed in a\npaper published online in Nature.\nAlthough it varies in proportion from\nspecies to species, a lot of DNA does\nnot actually code for anything; around\n98% of a human genome is non-coding,\ncompared to 11% of the genome of bacterium E. coli. This means that the coding portion that makes up genes has to\nbe identified, and, with the human genome consisting of 3.2 billion base pairs,\nthis can prove tricky. Genes themselves\nhave integral sequences called promoter\nregions that allow their identification in\nbetween all the millions of non-coding\nbase pairs, and ChIP-exo takes advantage of these integral sequences as PICs\nbind to them. Furthermore, ChIP-exo\neliminates \u201ctranscriptional noise,\u201d unwanted levels of transcription to allow detection of more PIC binding sequences than other sequencing methods\nwould allow. \u201cThe advantage over other\ntechniques of [ChIP-exo] is its ability\nto narrow down any binding location\nacross millions and billions of nucleotide genomes to a certainty of about one\nnucleotide,\u201d said Pugh.\nIn the new technique, genes are first\ntranscribed into a more dynamic molecule called RNA in a process called\ntranscription, that occurs in the nucleus.\nRNA is then translocated to the cytoplasm of the cell to provide the instructions to manufacture the protein. PICs\nare different proteins that allow and\ncontrol this RNA manufacture, and bind\nat the promoter regions of genes in a sequential manner to allow transcription\nto proceed. A better understanding of\nhow they position themselves along the\nDNAallows a greater insight into where\nthe genes actually start in the genome,\nand how gene expression in cells is\nNew insight into gene expression\nPhilippa Skett\nHe doesn\u2019t look very defiant, does he?\nregulated, as not all genes are active all\nof the time.\nTo identify these PICs and the sequences they bind to, exonucleases (the\n\u201cexo\u201d in ChIP-exo) were used. These\nenzymes catalyse the degradation of the\ndouble stranded helix effectively destroying the genome. Multiple exonu-cleases were applied across the whole\ngenome, and it degraded the DNA until\na cross-linking point was reached in\nDNA where the PICs begin to interact\nwith the promoter regions. These conserved regions were then isolated and\nsequenced accordingly. Rhee ran ChIPexo for various PICS, RNA Polymerase\nII, the enzyme that actively synthesises\nRNA, and for GTFs, General Transcription Factors, and mapped of the precise\nlocation of more than six thousand of\nthese PICs in yeast. The technique\nshowed how they interacted specifically\nwith nucleosomes: DNA bound tightly\nto proteins called histones to allow it to\nbe compacted into the nucleus.\nSo what does this indicate in the long\nrun? Studying yeast here allows for\nmany of the principles to be extrapolated\non to other species, including humans,\nto allow a better insight into their gene\nregulation and initiation; a small yet\ncrucial step towards being fully aware\nof the genomic capabilities of humans\nand how we can manipulate it in the fu-ture. Genetically modified crops, genetic\ndiseases, developmental disorders, and\nadvancing in on the cure for cancer are\nall areas that can benefit highly from the\nnew data this technique can deliver, and,\nwhen used in conjunction with existing\nmethods, the limits to our grasp of genetics have now been extended.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature10799\nIs this a sequence binding of proteins or did we print wrong?\nB.

    "content": "FILM\nClooney is an actor who seems to push\nthe boundaries as he ages. Although\nknown for playing slick and suave char-acters, here he is in The Descendants, a\nwarm and modest family drama in which\nthe confirmed bachelor of Hollywood\nplays a dedicated father of two, living in\nHawaii. The twist is that his wife ends\nup in a coma after a water-skiing acci-dent. He even admits that he\u2019s been the\nback-up parent in their marriage. But it\nappears the responsibility is suddenly on\nhim now. Not that he minds, of course;\nhe just doesn\u2019t have a clue on how to go\nabout this.\nHis elder daughter Alex(andra)\n(Shailene Woodley), the rebellious\nteen who drinks and experiments with\ndrugs, is far from pleased that her loser\nof a dad is now her full-time guardian.\nThe younger daughter, Scottie (Amara\nMiller) is a cheerful little firecracker, but\nnot so little that she does not understand\nThe real surprise, however, comes\nin the form of the two young actresses\nwho, even with very little screen expe-rience, absolutely nail their supporting\nroles. Their chemistry with Clooney is\nmore than just convincing, as the three\nof them settle so well into portraying a\ndysfunctional family. The news of their\nmother hits them both hard, and Woodley never overplays the rebellious side\nof her character, and it is impressive to\nsee a complex role written for a teenager\nhandled so well by the young actress.\nShe has bitter feelings towards everyone given her situation, but is grownup enough to understand that during\nthe more serious moments in her life,\nshe needs to step up. Payne also uses\nMiller\u2019s Scottie well, placing someone\nyoung in a position of having to deal\nwith her mother\u2019s impending death.\nSet in Hawaii, the audience is very\noften treated to some remarkable sights\nof the beautiful island, which is a bonus,\nreally, to the gentle, almost therapeutic\nview of family life painted by the always\nconsistent Payne. If you don\u2019t like his\npatient style, The Descendants is not a\nfilm that will change your views on this\nunique director, but for those who have\nbeen following his work, this is another\nrare treat that you cannot afford to miss.\nClooney is a family man\nwhat is happening with her mother. Being young and full of imaginations, she\ndoes do and say some outrageous things,\nsomething Matt (Clooney) doesn\u2019t quite\nknow how to handle.\nThe plot thickens however, as Matt\ndiscovers his wife\u2019s infidelity. This\ncomes as a complete shock to him, even\nmore so when the news is broken to him\nby Alex. He\u2019s devastated for sure, but\nhow can you be angry towards a comatose woman? The simple answer is, he\ncan\u2019t, and like any man on earth, he tries\nto track down \u201cthe other man,\u201d but perhaps not for the same reason most men\nwould.\nEven in the midst of quite a serious\nturn of events, Payne makes sure to\ninject some off-beat humour to keep\na healthy tone and pace. It never turns\ninto a serious tragedy, nor does it veer\ntowards hysterical comedy. There is certainly no room for any slap-stick com-edy. The film speaks from the heart, and\nthe laughs are an added bonus. Payne\nhas had successes in the past with films\nsuch as Sideways and About Schmidt,\nabout ordinary men going through unusual events, and \u201cThe Descendants\u201d\ndoes not stray far from what he is used\nto, but has original themes of its own.\nIt has a stronger focus on family for\nTime to drive away from all those damn photographers \u2013 and the crazy women who would do anything to get a piece of Clooney\nFELIX Friday 27 january 2012 33\nDirector Alexander Payne\nScreenwriters Alexander Payne,\nNat Faxon, Jim Rash\nCast George Clooney, Shailene\nWoodley, Amara Miller\nThe Descendants sure, as well as that difficult concept of\nlife and death, with forgiveness and redemption attached.\nCarrying the entire film on his shoulders is the invaluable Clooney, who\nmakes the task look so easy. It may not\nbe a particularly dramatic or showy\nrole, but playing the complexities of\nan ordinary husband and father faced\nwith unimaginable challenges, Clooney\nis a force to be reckoned with. He has\nthe confidence and likable qualities to\ncreate a charismatic and unique central\nhero. His interaction with his daughters\nis a heart-warming one, as he develops\nstronger bonds with his girls.\nJust because his wife is in a coma,\ndoesn\u2019t mean the world stops.

    "content": "A\nn animated and passionate figure in person,\nDr. Toby Murcott is as\none would imagine the\ntypical science journalist\n\u2013 never without an opinion, in possession of an open (yet critical and witty)\nmind and of course, a seemingly unlimited knowledge of everything within the\nbounds of science.\nThe fact that he can educate me on\nthe human genome, and equally as well\nstrike up a heated debate regarding the\nlatest happenings at CERN, is to be\nexpected given that he includes BBC\nRadio 4, The Times, Nature magazine\nas well as his own critically acclaimed\nbook The Whole Story: Alternative\nMedicine on Trial? amongst an impressive list of journalism projects in the\npast 20 years.\nHighlighting the uncertainties that\nmany science journalists face when embarking on their career path, Dr. Murcott begins his life story with more than\njust a hint of humour in his voice.\n\u201cLike so many people in this industry\nit wasn\u2019t a straightforward story. I did\na PhD in Biochemistry at Bristol University and then I moved onto a Postdoc\nwhich is when I began to realise that I\nwas not the greatest research scientist \u2013\nI quite enjoyed it but not as much as I\nwas hoping to.\nAt the same time, without really\nknowing it, I began to be a lot more involved in talking about science rather\nthan doing it.\u201d\nThanks to his long love of speech ra-dio, Dr. Murcott kicked off science journalism career in the medium, spending\nhis days working on his postdoc and his\nevenings building up his radio CV.\nHaving entered the world of radio\njournalism, Dr. Murcott also spread\nhis knowledge into written journalism,\neventually leading to the publication of\nhis book inspired by his weekly column\nin The Times discussing the scientific\nevidence behind complementary health\ntreatments. Nevertheless, despite all his\nsuccesses in writing science, Dr. Murcott is unhesitant in claiming his preference for radio journalism.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very noticeable that people who\nwork in a particular field tend to love\nthat field and really enjoy it, and I love\nto listen to radio for pleasure. There are\na number of satisfying things about ra-dio, one of which is that you hear real\npeoples voices and it\u2019s a very intimate\n\u201c...I began to talk\nmore about science\nrather than do it.\u201d Chabad of South Kensington invites you to\u2026\nSchedule: Friday, 3 Feb 2012\n6 pm - Dr Naftali Loewenthal - \"The Temple within\"\n7 pm - Kabalat Shabbat\n7.30 pm - Shabbat dinner\nProfessor Kate Loewenthal - \"Mental Health and Religion\"\nDr. Naftali Loewenthal - \"Metahistory of Judaism\"\nLocation: Imperial College Union, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7\nChabad of South Kensington is an independently funded\nbranch of Chabad Lubavitch UK charity, number 227638\nRSVP: www.SKchabad.com/unity\n\u202b\u05d1\"\u05d4\u202c\nFEATURE\nFELIX\nFriday 27 january 2012\n6\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nmedium and its very satisfying to have\nthat almost one to one connection with\npeople, giving them something interesting.\u201d\nCurrently also a lecturer in Science\nJournalism at the City University London, Dr. Murcott points out that he never underwent formal training in science\njournalism himself, and asked whether\nor not he feels that such courses are essential for success he declares, \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink there is an obvious answer, everyone is different.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a masters [in science journal-ism] does is it condenses and puts into\none place the various elements you need\nwhich are: practice, criticism and work\nexperience. It\u2019s not essential, but it is\none way of doing it. A good course is\nvery valuable.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that any journalist needs\nto be an expert on any subject other than\njournalism. But, the things a science\njournalist needs is to know is what questions to ask; to have an understanding of\nthe process of the work they\u2019re reporting on, as well as how science works so\nthey\u2019re able to rigorously examine the\nscience that is laid out in front of them.\u201d\nOn the topic of science journalism,\nI wonder what Dr. Murcott\u2019s views on\n\u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 science journalism are.\n\u201cYou have to ask \u2018What is the purpose\nof journalism?\u2019 Now there are a lot of\nthings a journalist would say \u2013 to hold\npeople who have public money to account and to comment on all sorts of\nthings. But actually, the point of journalism is to sell and get an audience,\nbecause unless you do that, you have no\nmoney to do the reporting or research\nyou want to do.\n\u201cI think we need to train journalists to\nunderstand what science research can\nand can\u2019t do, but I also think we need\nto trust people to know the difference\nbetween gossip and really serious science research. I\u2019ve certainly gotten angry reading bad science reports, but the\nmedia is not here to educate \u2013 that\u2019s the\njob of schools and universities.\n\u201cThis leads us onto discuss science in\ngeneral, to which Dr. Murcott has much\ninteresting information to impart.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very good analogy of sci-ence: if you imagine all our knowledge\nis a sphere, then the edge of the sphere\nis where our knowledge of the known\nleads the unknown. As you increase the\namount we know, that sphere gets bigger and so of course its surface area\ngets bigger \u2013 the more we know and the\nmore we uncover, the more we realise\nwe don\u2019t know.\u201d\nAs for what particularly interests him\ncurrently in the world of science, Dr.\nMurcott answers fluently \u201cfirstly, anything to do with the genome and ge-nomics. It won\u2019t be that long until we\ncan sequence an entire human genome\nin a matter of hours, and the things that\ncan be done with genetics is just mind-boggling.\n\u201cI think the other thing is particle\nand high-energy physics. We\u2019ve got a\nstandard model that was developed in\nthe 1920s which has stood up reasonably well but is starting to show signs\nof weakness at the edge; and while\nhunches are never reliable, I wouldn\u2019t\nbe surprised if there was a major revision of the standard model of physics in\nthe relatively near future.\n\u201cI also think another area that is very\ninteresting is the increasing computing\npower as it has allowed people to make\nmuch more complicated and elaborate\nmathematical models which have allowed us to test our understanding of\nwhat we know. We can test anything\nfrom climate science through to chemical equations, it can help us understand\nenvironmental issues and improve our\nknowledge in reducing energy con-sumption. Powerful computers are allowing us to do amazing things.\u201d\nNaturally, this leads onto a discussion\nregarding the recent results from CERN\nclaiming that the speed of light had been\nbroken, to which Dr. Murcott is confident is not the case.\n\u201cThere is some small error that they\nhaven\u2019t spotted. But what this story is\nis a beautiful story about how science\nworks. What\u2019s happened is that these\nresearchers have looked at these neutrinos and have tried to find the problem,\nwhich they can\u2019t, and so they\u2019ve put it\nout there for other scientists to look at.\nIt\u2019s not a story about neutrinos going\nfaster than light, it\u2019s a story about how\nscience works to get the most reliable\nanswers to a particular question.\u201d\nBefore wrapping up I ask him for any\nwords of wisdom he\u2019s like to offer to\nImperial\u2019s budding science journalists.\n\u201cAdvice I\u2019d give is to stand still, take\na moment and think \u2018What do I really\nlike doing? When I want information\nfrom the world where do I get it from?\u2019\nbecause you\u2019re going to do better in a\nmedium you know, like and understand.\nThe most important thing about being a science journalist is having done\nsomething that gives you practice and\nexperience, and finding out whether or\nnot you can really do it.\nWhat I think is very hard to do and\nvery often lacking in science journalism\nis a deep understanding to how science\nworks, and recognising why it is that\nwhen you ask a scientist a big question\nthey can\u2019t give a clear answer.\nDeep down it\u2019s a combination of curi-osity, nosiness and fascination; the ability to meet a deadline; to be able talk to\nand extract information from scientists,\nand of course strong communication\nskills that makes a good science journalist.\u201d\nHow to become a science journalist\nAlice Yang talks to Dr. Toby Murcott about his not so straightforward career path\n\u201c...take a moment\nand think \u2018What do I\nreally like doing?\u2019\u201d\nDr. Murcott\u2019s book is one of many ventures into journalism\n\u201cA science journalist\nneeds to know what\nquestions to ask\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nFELIX\nFriday 27 january 2012\n26\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMusic Editors: \u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto\nStephen Smith\nI actually did that once. For two years I\nwould listen to, of all metal genres, black\nmetal. The really deep underground stuff. At\none point I realised that it was just stagnant.\nThe whole genre is about achieving a point\nof perfection in the sound, being cult and\ntrue and whatever. Ironically, it\u2019s about being as under produced and grim as possible.\nMetal has merged with so many genres now,\nit\u2019s almost ridiculous to list them\u2026 you can\nget symphonic metal, jazz fusion\u2026\nYou can attach the metal tag to anything\u2026\nthat\u2019s the problem with rap metal haha\nYeah haha and it sounds stupid at first but it\ndoes help to open your ears a lot and you can\nend up listening to straight jazz afterwards.\nI meant to ask you about dubstep actually.\nIt just seems to release a lot of\u2026 displaced\nanger.\nI think dubstep is actually electronic \u2018djent\u2019.\nYou can really draw a parallel because dubstep is really about dropping a thump when\nyou least expect it. Some of the stuff the Music Tech guys do I really enjoy. Breaks and\nthings.\nI don\u2019t really mind\u2026 I think the most, I\nwouldn\u2019t say irritating, but sad thing, is when\nyou see people listening to music and they\u2019re\njust not really doing anything. I find it very\ndifficult to not even tap your foot\u2026 like you\nsaid, at least with dubstep there is a release.\nI guess there are also the more intellectual\nstyles of music like jazz and IDM.\nYeah, but that\u2019s really for the musicians I\nthink. At a lot of metal gigs, the audience is\nfull of... not nerds, but\u2026 even the bands say\nit would be nice if our music would be more\naccessible to people who don\u2019t understand\nSo you have a steady back beat with something really funky over the top. You separate\nyour hands from your feet, sort of. It\u2019s quite\nsyncopated which is why you could call it\ngroovy. I suppose Meshuggah pioneered that\nstyle. I really enjoy music which has a lot of\npolyrhythms. That\u2019s not really what we play\nwith Inescapable Fate though, because it\noften comes to a stage when it just becomes\nwankery. We\u2019re a lot more straight up.\nThat\u2019s cool. I didn\u2019t know you did solo elec-tronics.\nYeah. I find myself listening to a lot of sad,\natmospheric music. Just long\u2026 long, sad\ntracks\u2026 I must sound like such a miserable\nfuck haha\nIt\u2019s okey.\nI think that\u2019s what drew me into metal.\nThere\u2019s a lot of attack but there can also be a\nlot of really strong melodies.\nYeah. I think what most people don\u2019t seem to\ngrasp about metal, and why they tend to just\nshun it away, is that they don\u2019t see the cathartic side of it. When I was playing metal\nI found it to be such a powerful release of\nenergy that\u2019s pretty hard to find otherwise.\nYeah. I guess my advice to anyone who wants\nto get into metal is not to take it too seriously.\nWhen I play or just listen to it I just can\u2019t help\nbut want to move, it\u2019s kind of bizarre. When\nyou\u2019ve got a kick drum up at volume and it\nresonates and you can feel it in your body\u2026\nThere\u2019s a lot of fanatics who are really elitist\nbut you know, if you don\u2019t like that music,\nthat\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about. But I find that\na lot of metal musicians I meet are actually\nreally open minded. There\u2019s no point putting\nyourself in a box and listen to only one kind\nof music.\nHow long has the band been going?\nI really should know this\u2026 I\u2019ve been playing\nwith them for a couple of years, but they were\nalready together for a few years before that.\nWow. So it\u2019s a quite a long standing band\nthen.\nYeah, but it\u2019s\u2026 piss poor, because we\u2019ve\nonly played about 5 or 6 gigs. Just far too\nbusy really. We practice every week but we\njust don\u2019t play many gigs, though recently\nwe\u2019ve been heading out more. We played the\nFiddler\u2019s Elbow in Camden last term, with\na couple of other thrash and rock bands. It\nwas pretty well received. We\u2019ve got a couple\nmore gigs lined up this term.\nWould you say you guys are death metal,\nthrash metal, or somewhere in between\u2026?\nI heard someone calling you brutal death\nmetal.\nOh, we\u2019re not brutal by any standards. We\nonly have about two blast beats in our entire\nrepertoire. I think Greg (Power, founder of\nthe Felix Music Nights last year) got it into\nhis head, but I\u2019d say we\u2019re more thrashy, but\nthe vocals are death.\nCookie Monster style.\nYeah, well there\u2019s a bit more diction. I\u2019ve\nheard worse than Sean\u2019s vocals. You can\nmake out what he\u2019s saying if you listen close-ly.\nHold on, my recorder\u2019s running out of\njuice\u2026 Let me just delete these traffic re-cordings.\nDo you use that to record traffic?\nAmong other things. Mainly to get source\nmaterial for samples.\nI\u2019ve recorded some rain sounds before with\none of those.\nOh cool. Do you use them in the band or for\nyour own solo projects?\nIt\u2019s for my own stuff. I\u2019ve got a few tracks\non my DoC homepage, of all places, that are\nmore or less different than what we play in\nthe band. Sort of like the stuff you played at\nKABLAAM, I quite enjoy the sort of atmospheric sounds. At the moment I\u2019m really into\nsort of groovy stuff, like polyrhythms, which\nI\u2019ve been doing a lot of recently. Synths as\nwell\u2026 I love electronics basically.\nGroovy how? Drum based or oscillatory?\nThe genre I\u2019m in at the moment is called\n\u2018djent\u2019.\nI read about that in your interview with\nGreg last term. Isn\u2019t that metal though?\nIt is metal. It\u2019s kinda like Marmite \u2013 the sort\nof thing you either love or hate. The idea is\nyou play a very simple 4/4 beat and the bass\ndrum follows the guitar\u2026 it\u2019s not necessarily\nthe idea but that\u2019s how a lot of people do it.\nInescapable Fate\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto talks death and dubstep with\nlead guitarist Will Jones, ahead of the Felix Music Night\nSpikey metal logo replaced with baroque oil painting.\nKadhim\u2019s totally hot\nalbum of the week\nContinued overleaf...\nDizzee Rascal\nDirteeTV.com\nSkank Recordings\n2012\nThe most irritating thing about Tim Westwood is\nthis: he\u2019s actually 100% credible. He\u2019s been supporting UK hip-hop since the 80s and, by all fair\nmetrics, has earned the right to ram obnoxious\nhorns and gunshot sounds up the backside of\nevery track he plays on his radio show. I, on the\nother hand, have absolutely zero street-cred \u2013 unless of course you count the Walkway as a street,\nand you accept furiously avoiding eye contact as\n\u2018cred\u2019.\nWhich, you could argue, might make my decision to choose Dizzee Rascal\u2019s new mixtape as\nmy Totally Hot Album of the Week slightly strange.\nThe only UK hip-hop I\u2019ve ever listened to is Foreign\nBeggars; whose 2003 album Asylum Speakers is a\nmust-listen and whose 2008 song \u2018Hit that Gash\u2019\nis... well, find out for yourself. So, what insights\nabout grime, a genre of music as far removed from\nmy expertise as astute political analysis is from\nDizzee, could I offer you? Well to you \u2018haters\u2019 \u2013\nsee, I can totally get into this \u2013 I say this: I may\nnot understand a word of French, but I\u2019d sure as\nhell as jizz my pants if Audrey Tautou started talking to me.\nLet\u2019s be clear: this ain\u2019t no pop record. With Calvin Harris off cheating on him with Rihanna (who\nwould say no?), Dizzee has gone back to the quick-fire spitting with which he first made his name in\nthe early 2000s. All that festival-pop nonsense\nhas gone the way of Sports Direct\u2019s stock and bug-gered off down the street. Grime-Dizzee is back.\nThe tracks are bombastic, viciously-tight, full of\nswagger, and as energetic as an LHC proton (and\nyes, that joke is exactly why I\u2019ll never have street-cred). But naff jokes aside, there\u2019s something\nprimally appealing about this mixtape. It makes\nyou want to bounce off the walls, get pumped up,\nand perhaps run about throwing gang signs while\nstudiously avoiding confrontation with people who\nactually understand the lingo...\nI\u2019ve genuinely got nothing bad to say about this\ntape. Criticism is fairly difficult when you\u2019re busy\nconcentrating on skanking like a total boss. Imperial, it\u2019s time to leave your comfort zone and get\ndirtee this week. Just think of it as gateway grime.\nPeace out.\nTweet me @kadhimshubber and let me know whether it\u2019s acceptable for a guy who went to private\nschool in Eastbourne to say \u2018Peace out\u2019. Alternatively, tweet @CalvinHarris and tell him, \u201cIf I ever see\nyou near Dizzee again, I\u2019ll pop a cap brah!!!\u201d\n\n"

Build a zero-gravity space capsule\nand \ufb01ll with water. Bring water to boil.\n2. Chop ends off beans using Navy\nSEALS LASER tracking system.\n3. Insert vacuum-packed green beans\ninto the capsule.\n4. Cook for 265.3\u03c0 seconds, monitoring the crunchiness of the beans every\n0.0000000001 seconds using the Vickers hardness test, set to HV10.\n5. Refresh beans with liquid nitrogen\ncooled Amazonian rain water and dry\nin CERN Particle Accelerator.\n6. Serve with injection moulded mustard vinaigrette.\nIt\u2019s enough to make me scream \u201cNobody cares! Nobody cares!\u201d It\u2018s just\noverenthusiastic drivel from what appears to be a slightly unhinged, borderline OCD chef. It\u2019s all too much\nwhen chucking the beans into a pan for\n3 minutes and then drizzling with olive oil would have done just \ufb01ne. My\nbrother, knowing my disdain for overcomplicated cooking, gave me Heston\u2019s At Home book for Christmas \u2013 a\nbitter-sweet respite from the hilarious\nannual gag of planting a chocolate willy in the bottom of a used, otherwise\nempty PlayStation 3 box. Although the\nCharles Betts\nTuition fees protests wastes good placards\nHiggs boson? Probably Heston again\nlast laugh was on me when, during my\ncollege canteen-inspired squelchy vegetable souf\ufb02\u00e9 demonstration on Boxing day, the liquid nitrogen container\nspilt over his leg and he lost four toes.\nThere is, however, one seemingly\nunnecessarily arduous recipe in the\nbook that is worth the bother. That\nmakes my initial anger look rightfully\nmisjudged, that I should just \u201ccalm\ndown dear\u201d. I used to think a potato\nwas just a potato, that to make chips\nall you had to do was boil them for 10\nminutes or so and then fry them. Heston has taught me otherwise. First, the\npotato chips need to be rinsed under\nrunning water to remove any surface\nstarch. They are then boiled in a pan\nof simmering water for 20-30 minutes\nand left too cool. They then go in the\nfreezer for at least an hour, before being fried in grapeseed oil to create a\nlight crust. By this stage, used to meals\nprepared in under half an hour, my\nstomach starts grumbling. Then it\u2019s\nback in the freezer for a further hour as\nmy stomach starts to invoke the Battle\nof the Somme, before being fried again\nat a higher temperature until they are\ngolden. So, that\u2019s around 3 hours to\nmake some bloody chips. It all seems\na bit like when the US spent millions\nof dollars developing a special pen that\ncould work in space, and the Russians\njust took a pencil.\nWhen I \ufb01rst made these triple-A\npparently 2012 is going\nto be a bumper year for\nprotests, and I am quite\nlooking forward to them.\nAs the late Christopher\nHitchens once wrote, \u201cseek out argument and disputation for their own sake;\nthe grave will provide plenty of time for\nsilence\u201d. But what would the brilliant\nman have made of the recent tuition\nfees increase? Having earned a third\nclass degree in PPE from Oxford, and\nhaving achieved in his short life much\nmore of merit than David Cameron \u2013\nwho got a first class degree in precisely\nthe same course \u2013 he would probably\nadvise against going to university at all.\nHe\u2019d say that it\u2019s vastly overrated, except\nfor the cheap alcohol.\nIn saying this, Hitchens would be \u2013 as\nhe often was \u2013 wrong but for all the right\nreasons. When he graduated, he became\nsocial science editor on the Times Higher Education Supplement, something\nunthinkable today, even with a first-class degree. Currently, a good degree\nis essential for all but the most menial\nof jobs, and even then, work experience\nand networking are always necessary\nfor starting in better-paid careers.\nThe life of a graduate in 2012 is wildly different from that of one from the\nHitchens era, which makes the tripling\nof tuition fees appear to be, at first sight,\n\u201cthe biggest betrayal of young people\nin postwar British politics\u201d as anti-fees\ncampaigner Michael Chessum wrote in\nthe Guardian last year. If going to university is so essential, why would the\nGovernment want to discourage thousands of people with higher fees?\nBut is it really as bad as Chessum\nclaims? A graduate on a standard\n\u00a325,000 salary will only pay back \u00a37\nper week. Think of David Cameron as\na friendly gentleman giving you four\nyears of education and housing in exchange for two pints every Friday even-ing, and it really doesn\u2019t seem like such\nbad value. In a world where no degree\noften means no career, you must really\nmisunderstand the loan repayment system to be put off going to University\nbecause of the fees.\nNo one should be discouraged from\napplying simply because they are poor:\nthe Government will give you enough\nmoney to live and pay for your tuition,\nand by the time you have to pay it back\nyou\u2019ll be quite rich by many people\u2019s\nstandards. Of course, in an ideal world\nthere would be no fees, and of course\nit\u2019s annoying suddenly having to pay\nmore of them, but that\u2019s all it is: an-noying. Like a persistent itch, or David\nCameron\u2019s patronising and rather sinister voice: we just have to deal with it, it\u2019s\nreally not that bad.\nConsequently, protesting about tuition fees is a waste of good placards,\nespecially when there is a huge number\nof other, vastly more worrying, issues\nabout which to protest. The semi-pri-vatisation of the NHS, the disgustingly\nharsh sentences for some London riot-ers, corporate lobbying of the Government, the complete neglect of environmental issues, the abolition of the EMA,\nthe technocratification of the EU, the\napproaching war with Iran, the secretive drone war in Pakistan, widening social inequality, the atrociously selective\nreporting by the popular press, rising\nunemployment, and the soaring price of\ncooked chips, I dived straight in for a\ngolden \ufb01nger starving as I was after 3\nhours of waiting. But WOW! What a\ncorker! This, I immediately decided,\nis how chips are supposed to be. This\nis what the potato is for. This is what\nhappens when a nerdy chef cooks\nand re-cooks different potato recipes\nhundreds of times and uses science to\nguide him. Odd how you can forget\nwhat really good food tastes like. And\neach time you rediscover it, you won-whisky, amongst other things.\nThere is so much to be angry about in\n2012 that protesting about tuition fees\nis like running into a burning house to\nrescue an expensive packet of biscuits\nwhile several young children scream\nwith pain as the flames engulf them in\nthe next room.\nNevertheless, this weekend the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts\n(NCAFC) will meet for its National\nConference in Liverpool. There they\nwill discuss and decide how this year\u2019s\nstudent protests will unfold. My only\nhope for the conference is that they\nleave as the National Campaign Against\nCuts, putting the question of tuition fees\naside until the more serious matters are\nresolved.\nFar from being a heroic student uprising of the Mai \u201868 variety, as Chessum\nlikes to say, tuition fees protests merely\ndistract us from the truly important\nissues. As students, rising youth unemployment is our greatest worry and\nwe should concentrate our anger there.\nThat and the soaring price of whisky,\nnaturally.\nThis, I immediately\ndecided, is\nhow chips are\nsupposed to be.\nThis is what the\npotato is for\n\u201c\nThis, I i\nThis, I\ndecide\ndecide\nder how you ever put up with anything\nelse. Why you should live to eat. The\nchips crunched gracefully, they didn\u2019t\nsplodge. The middle was as soft as mo-hair. These are chips as I have never\nknown; they surprise you. One immediately feels privileged that this fellow\nhas shared his secrets with us. It\u2019s like\nFernando Alonso giving you a driving\nlesson, or Stephen Fry showing you\nhow to use Twitter. It\u2019s just\u2026 well, it\u2019s\njust lovely.\nNO, LEFT THE CHIPS IN THE OVEN FOR 10ns TOO LONG. WHY ALWAYS ME?\nStephen Smith\nThere is a huge\nnumber of other,\nvastly more\nworrying, issues\nabout which to\nprotest.\n\u201c\nThere i\nThere i\nnumbe\nnumbe\n\n"

    "content": "Tips & Hacks\nMegaupload down, hackers revolt\nThursday last week, the U.S. Justice Department\nseized and shut down the websites of Megaupload\nLimited, most known for megaupload.com and\nmegavideo.com. They have also begun criminal\ncases against owners and executives of the com-pany. Attempting to access one of the company\u2019s\nwebsites gets you a lovely FBI notice, listing the\ncrimes of the company as \u201cconspiracy to commit\nracketeering, conspiracy to commit copyright in-fringement, conspiracy to commit money laundering and criminal copyright infringement\u201d. All serious\nallegations, and the FBI have backed this up \u2013 organising for the New Zealand Police to raid a mansion where four executives were, seizing assets,\nincluding luxury cars, worth $17m. In response to\nthis, the activist group Anonymous launched what\nthey have described as \u201cthe single largest Internet\nattack in its history\u201d. Many websites were taken\ndown, including that of the U.S. Department of\nJustice, using distributed denial-of-service attacks.\nThey haven\u2019t stopped either, with many links claiming to be ways to access Megaupload sites using\nJavascript to automatically have your computer join\nin the attacks. Be careful!\nI\nwas one of the 1.2 million adults in\nBritain gifted an Amazon Kindle this\nChristmas, and as far as presents go\nit\u2019s probably my favourite so far. Using the device has been a dream, and it\nhas made the 20 hours I spent stuck flying in\neconomy class this winter many magnitudes\nmore enjoyable. There is much to praise about\nthe Kindle, and most of it has been said al-ready. The price speaks for itself, the device is\nsolid and the ability to pick up newspapers and\nmagazines from publishers across the world\n(delivered daily to your bedside table, no less)\nmakes it a unique pick in a field of lookalikes.\nSetting the positive device reviews aside for\na moment, I would like to focus on something\nthat not many technology reviews have dealt\nwith. Understandably, most reviewers have\ncentred their pieces around the device itself\nand the software that runs on it. What this ex-cludes, however, is a discussion on how the\nKindle Store works. It\u2019s where I find the Kindle experience fails miserably. For the uniniti-ated, the Kindle Store is where all the magic\nof buying those books/newspapers/magazines\nactually happens. Or where it\u2019s supposed to\nhappen.\nStruggling to spend\nWhat I find is that the Kindle Store (both online and on-device) is really very poor at getting you to books that you want to read. After\nhaving unpacked my Kindle, I set about looking around the store to buy a few books for my\nflight the next day. When you reach the home\npage of the store you are met with three options for choosing books: browsing the entire\nlibrary, choosing from a featured selection or\npicking up a recommended book.\nBrowsing the entire library, as you would ex-pect, is a mammoth task. Small as the Kindle\nlibrary is at the moment, hundreds of thousands\nof books lie in wait, and Amazon does little to\nease the pain of searching through them. Clicking on this option leads you to a list of major\ngenres. Clicking on a genre leads you to a list\nof books, ordered by sales (you can also order\nby rating, and possibly by price). I don\u2019t know\nhow many bibliophiles read the Technology\nsection each week, but if you have any experience buying books you\u2019ll see why this is really\nvery poor. Aside from buying science fiction, I\nhave never gone into a bookshop with a specific genre in mind (\u2018Ooh, I\u2019m feeling like some\nalternative historical romance this week\u2019), and\nI don\u2019t focus very much on bestseller lists.\nSorting books by rating doesn\u2019t help me identify books I want either: Heston\u2019s Fantastical\nFeasts might be well appreciated by cookery\nnuts but I\u2019m really not in the market for that\nsort of non-fiction. Sorting by price, and we\u2019re\ngetting just a little bit silly.\n\u201cAmazon does little\nto ease the pain of\nsearching through them\u201d\nThose who head to the editors\u2019 picks for\ngood content are better off, but only very\nslightly. The recommendations are good, but\nare usually fairly major books that you\u2019ll find\nrecommended by other website and reviews.\nThere aren\u2019t that many of them either, and if\nyou\u2019re looking for something better than the\nbrowse feature to dive into Amazon\u2019s library,\nthis isn\u2019t one of them.\nThe Recommended Books section fares the\nbest, but it\u2019s still not a great effort. Buying\nsome Kurt Vonnegut has crowded my recommendations section with all of his books, along\nwith a scattering of bestsellers. Assuming that\nbecause I read one book by an author I am\nsimilarly interested in all his books is a charmingly deluded notion. It also introduces me to\nprecious little in the way of new authors and\nbooks; surely in the age of Google I don\u2019t need\nto be pushed into staring at the bibliography of\nan author I am already aware of?\nFinding solutions\nIf the store experience is so dire, where can\nAmazon improve? I think one good (and ba-sic) step would be to include plot summaries\nof books on the results pages. The status quo,\na list of titles, star ratings and book covers is\nalmost entirely uninformative. Overall, how-ever, the browsing experience needs to be re-vamped. You need to be presented with more\nbooks on every page, books that aren\u2019t surgically sectioned away into neat categories. A\nvirtual bookshelf would be nice, where you\ncould see the spine/front cover of every book\nand a small plot summary popup when you\nhover over a specific book. Recommendations\nneed to be completely revamped, in a way that\napplies to all of Amazon\u2019s services (on a related note, I am not enamored of the fact that\nbuying one USB cable has meant Amazon assuming I am in some sort of computer-cabling\nmafia).\nThe problems all stem from one central\ntheme: Amazon is not Google, but is acting\nas if it is. The book with the most number of\n\u2018hits\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m more likely to read it.\nBeing able to sort by a wide variety of options\ndoesn\u2019t improve my purchasing experience.\nWhat the Kindle Store is forcing me to do is\nlook up books in real life and head to Amazon\nto buy them when I get home, simply because\nbrowsing on the Kindle is a mess. If the Kindle\nStore is meant to be a alternative to your brick-and-mortar retailer (as the Amazon marketing\nshtick would suggest), it\u2019s doing a massive disservice to a vast user base.\nKindling dissatisfaction\nFeroz Salam finds the Kindle Store massively unintuitive\nIn a massive boost to London\u2019s internet infrastruc-ture, O2 have announced they will be providing free\ninternet to millions in central London with Europe\u2019s\nbiggest free Wi-Fi zone. Beginning their rollout\nsoon, the coverage will start off small, but by the\ntime the Olympic Games are here, the boroughs of\nWestminster and Kensington and Chelsea should\nbe covered. It even comes at no cost whatsoever to\nthe taxpayer \u2013 how lovely of them. The system will\napparently be installed on street furniture throughout the covered areas, so one would hope they\u2019ve\ngot a fairly foolproof anti-vandalism/theft system\nthought out. Bad news though, if you live in one\nof the areas and think this means you can ditch\nyour home broadband \u2013 the service isn\u2019t meant as\na replacement for that purpose.

Doctors have\na duty to help people: it forms the core\nof their oath. The people of Gaza suffered due to military attacks, invasions\nand bombings. It was manmade guns\nand missiles that murdered the chil-dren, women and men of Gaza. Thus it\nwas the duty of Dr. Gilbert, and indeed\nall doctors, to shout out to the world to\nstop the cause of this suffering.\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES\nFELIX Friday 27 january 2012 41\nLoay, a ten year old boy at the time,\nreturned home to help his dad collect\na few of their belongings after having\nhad to leave their home in Beit Lahia.\nThey were hit by a missile which killed\nhis cousin. Loay survived but lost both\nof his eyes. Today, Loay lives with his\nfamily in a house where the kitchen,\nliving room, bedroom are all the same\nroom. Though Loay suffered, he remains optimistic and is very supportive\nof his younger siblings. Loay is determined to live.\nThe talk was very enlightening and\nthought provoking for all that attended.\nThere were far too many matters and\ntopics for me to discuss in this article,\nso I will finish as Dr. Gilbert finished\nhis talk \u2013 there is something we can\nall do to help, no matter how small our\ncontribution.

One day there will be a Free\nPalestine.\nImperial College Palestinian Society\nhad the privilege of hosting a talk by\nDr. Mads Gilbert last Friday. Dr. Gilbert, a renowned Norwegian doctor,\nvolunteered in Gaza in 2009; at a time\nwhen Gaza was under a dreadful inva-sion.\nThe talk, entitled \u2018The misuse of\nHealth & Medicine in Palestine\u2019,\nbrought the Gaza massacre vividly\nback to our memories. A minute of images under the sound of bombs and air\nattacks set the scene of fear and terror\nPalestinians lived through for three\nweeks. Dr. Gilbert; through his impressive speaking talent, was able to make\nthe audience glimpse what living in\nGaza was like at that point in its histo-ry, and highlighted the determination\nof the Palestinian people to survive and\nresist.\nThe story started with Kahlil, a Palestinian refugee in Lebanon, whose\nHealth, medicine, and Palestine\nPalestinian Society report on a talk by Gaza volunteer Dr. Mads Gilbert\nNabih Hanbali\nDr. Gilbert spoke on the relationship between medicine and politics\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that water is\nessential for survival. Lesser known,\nperhaps, is the multitude of water-re-lated problems faced by people in areas\nwithout adequate water supplies such as\nTabora.\nThe few shallow wells, lakes and rivers that provide the local population\nwith water are often contaminated with\nviruses and bacteria that cause deadly\ndiseases such as diarrhoea and typhoid\nfever. In developing countries such as\nTanzania, the second greatest child killer in rural areas is diarrhoea, causing\nover one and half million deaths each\nyear.\nIn many cases, families cannot afford\nsupplies to sterilise their water, whether\nthey be water purification tablets, water\nfiltration systems, or stoves and fuel for\nboiling water. Just as often, they simply don\u2019t understand the importance of\nsanitation and clean water. This is why\none of the main aims of Raincatcher,\naside from building rainwater harvesting tanks, is to educate the local population on effective hygiene and sanitation.\nEven when municipal water supplies\nare drinkable, they are often extremely\nexpensive and unaffordable to the majority of the population. Some of the\npoorest people in Tanzania spend 10%\nof their income just on buying water at\ninflated prices.\nAside from the risk of water supplies\nbeing unsafe to drink, the sheer time\ntaken to collect water from wells and\nground water supplies, often located\nmany miles away from villages, leads to\nmany harmful long-term consequences.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for women and\nchildren to have to walk several hours\nevery day to collect water from distant\nsupplies. Walk in the day and endure\nthe searing heat of the African sun;\nwalk at night and risk being attacked or\nsexually assaulted in the darkness.\nThe hours spent queuing up for water\nand carrying it home is time that should\nbe spent going to school. It\u2019s time that\nshould be spent taking care of a family.\nIt\u2019s time that should be spent on work,\nearning money to support a home.\nEducation is a vital step in breaking\nthe poverty cycle, contributing to the\npopulation\u2019s economic sustainability.\nProper schooling is seen as one of the\nmost effective methods for combatting\nHIV and AIDS, as well as for promoting gender equality. Constructing our\nwater tanks near schools has the advantage of giving parents an incentive to\nsend their children to school to receive\na decent education.\nIn short, free and easy access to clean\nwater is of paramount importance in alleviating the water crisis in Tabora \u2013 not\njust by providing drinking water for the\nlocal population, but also through the\nmany opportunities that present themselves with the help of an improved wa-Bringing the rain to those in need\nRaincatcher Imperial on the vast importance of water provision\nter supply.\nTo find out more about Raincatcher\nImperial, or to donate money to us\nthrough Virgin Money Giving, visit\nwww.raincatcherimperial.org.

Or it tries\nto be.\nNot like Spank Alley I suppose!\nSo other than the London Jazz Festival which is\nconsistently ridiculously amazing, how do you\nfind the jazz scene in London?\nMatt: There\u2019s the Jazz Caf\u00e9 up in Camden.\nEugene: There\u2019s a nice joint in Fulham\u2026\nClub 606! I remember going there in 1st year,\nbecause it was just a few streets away from Orient House where I was. It\u2019s in the middle of this\nindustrial estate. You just have to find this black\nmetal door and walk down these dingy stairs\u2026\nJermyn: Yeah, it\u2019s underground right?\nOnce you get downstairs it\u2019s really chill though.\nThere\u2019s a really strong free jazz scene, particularly around Dalston. Are any of you guys into that?\nJordan: I quite like some of that.\nEugene: That\u2019s what we call our solos if they\ndon\u2019t work out! \u201cThat was freeform!\u201d\nMatt: It\u2019s good because you can never be wrong.\nJermyn: Just walk off the stage to get a beer and\ncall it \u2018expression\u2019.\nanyway.\nDo you try to work your own thing around the\nold classics?\nMatt: One of the songs we\u2019re playing, \u2018Watermelon Man\u2019, has turned out to be a different tune\naltogether.\nDo you ever play any songs in strange tunings?\nEugene: It\u2019s all been standard so far hasn\u2019t it?\nFaris: \u2018Actual Proof\u2019 is hardly standard.\nEugene: Ohhh I remembered practicing that over\nand over and over and over\u2026\nSo have you played the whole of the Headhunter\u2019s record or what?\nJordan: Nearly!\nMatt: It\u2019s so tempting to just stick with Herbie\nHancock!\nHave you guys seen him live?\nJordan: I have. He\u2019s like 74 now. He still jams\npretty hard. I saw Roy Haynes recently, who was\nrather instrumental in the 50s bebop scene. He\u2019s\n86 now and he still plays amazingly well. It\u2019s ri-diculous.\nJermyn: We saw McCoy Tyner recently. He was\nJohn Coltrane\u2019s pianist\nHave you guys been to Ronnie Scott\u2019s?\nMatt: Yeah. My cousin actually DJs for the club\nWhen I learned to sight-read I just ended up\nmemorising the songs and pretending to read\nlong.\nJordan: That sounds familiar.\nI do envy those people though. You can think\nabout music in a completely different way. You\ncan see real patterns on the pages and if you\u2019re\ntrying to write rather than improvise you can play\nwith those forms.\nSo what have you been playing lately?\nJermyn: We play a lot of Herbie Hancock cov-ers.\nMatt: It seems to be our preferred thing right now.\nEugene: Not so much jazz any more. More funk,\nbut it\u2019s a good thing.\nMatt: Yeah, we\u2019re playing an Average White\nBand song.\nAny traditional standards?\nFaris: Yeah.\nI wouldn\u2019t call Herbie Hancock traditional jazz\nthough\u2026\nJordan: Traditional jazz-funk! Well we started\nplaying some more traditional stuff\u2026\nEugene: Miles Davis as well.\nFaris: \u2018Spain\u2019, \u2018Caravan\u2019\u2026\nNo Kind of Blue?\nMatt: \u2018So What\u2019!\nDon\u2019t you need an upright for that?\nJordan: I\u2019ve got one actually.\nDude! Get it out!\nJordan: Stick a Big Muff on it haha\nMatt: Of course our real aim is to become a 70s\ndisco band.\nJordan: I\u2019m trying to grow an afro right now.\nDon\u2019t count on it.\nJordan: Why not? What do you mean?\nWell\u2026 3rd year PhD. Anyway...\nSo how big\u2019s your repertoire?\nFaris: We\u2019ve got about 20 songs or so\u2026\nMatt: We\u2019ve only been playing together since\nNovember. I came to Imperial the month before.\nThese guys played before in various incarnations\nthough. We try to play at least a couple of hours\na week.\nEugene: This is our first proper gig actually, other\nthan the jam nights.\nIs that because you\u2019re playing only standards at\nthe moment?\nJermyn: In jazz it\u2019s more about the improvisation\nSpank Alley at Tuesday\u2019s Jazz & Rock jam night\nThe anguish. \u201cI need a beer. Leave me alone.\u201d\n[dramatic silence for 10 minutes while you get\nserved]\nSo, I\u2019m taking that as a no.\nMatt: Pretty much.\nDo you guys know Sun Ra?\nJordan: Yeah! Did you go see them at Oto?\nNot the last time but I caught them during their\n3-day residency which prolonged to 5 because the\nIcelandic volcano left them stuck in London.\nAnyway, for those of you who don\u2019t know him,\nhe was this free jazz guy in the 60s who took too\nmany drugs. He had this sort of cosmic jazz take\non things and he believed he was from another\nplanet.\nJordan: Yeah, he actually started playing bebop\nkind of stuff and somehow went\u2026\nBackstage.\nHe thought jazz was channelling the spirit of\nthe universe or something and I can see what he\nmeant. Jazz is some of the most exploratory music there is and much more free than classical.\nMatt: Classical is much more composed. There\u2019s\nalmost no room for free interpretation.\nFaris: Having said that, there\u2019s a lot of baroque\nmusic which has a lot of improvisational harpsichord passages and variations.\nI always thought that when a composer is working on his magnum opus , there must be a lot\nof theory behind it but there was probably some\nspontaneous moment which sparked it. That\u2019s\nwhat strange about classical music. It seems so\nrestrained though, it almost seems to lose the human element. That\u2019s what jazz manages to save.\nMatt: you can say what you like about classical\nmusic but you have to admit it\u2019s stood the test of\ntime.\nSome people might beg to differ on that.\nJordan: Some of the modern classical music is really just modern music which is scored for a full\norchestra and it just seems to come off as forced.\nSome of the purposefully dissonant stuff really\ntries to say something but a lot of it just fails.\nSo finally, how did your colourful name come\nabout?\nMatt: \u2018Spank-A-Lee\u2019 is a song by Herbie Hancock.\nIs there no other motivation behind it?\nJordan: It is funk after all so there has to be a bit\nof spank.\nEugene: What better place to get down and dirty\nthan an alley?\n...Continued from Page 28\nGiven to the Wild\nThe third album from The Maccabees has been\nreleased after much anticipation and to critical\nacclaim. Sorry, \u201cmuch\u201d anticipation? Critically\nacclaimed by who now?\nThings are expected to change for the Maccabees. Their new single has had airplay on\nnational daytime radio and the new album has\nhad plenty of press coverage; but when it comes\ndown to it, is the music strong enough to turn\nThe Maccabees into the new Coldplay or Muse?\nComing from one of their biggest fans who\nhas been following them since before they had\neven released a single record, the answer is simply no.\nJudging the LP alone, it is spectacular. Dark\nyet warm, sweet without being sickly, it has a\nhuge sound while maintaining an intimate, personal feel. Orlando Weeks sings with such tenderness that his voice sometimes cannot be distinguished from the music. This is no bad thing:\nit demonstrates the ability of the band to ensure\nthat their instruments have significance and do\nnot solely act as a support for his voice.\nThe overall vibe is one of maturity. Not only\nin comparison to their infantile earlier releases\nand the fact that it will not be just 15 year olds\nlistening, but lyrically explores the idea of being Given to the Wild, having to grow up, and\nthe temporary nature of the life we grow up for.\nThe amazing thing is that it matches style of\ntheir music, so much so that when you listen\nyou feel that unnerving feeling: the one where\nyou realise that you are maturing every second\nof every day, and you finally realise who you\nare becoming.\nHowever, albums will never be judged alone,\nand the fact is The Maccabees are not underrated and have not produced anything to label\nthem as such. It is a beautiful album and will no\ndoubt be one of my favourites of 2012, but as I\nfan I hope that it is not the album which defines\nthe Maccabees, because they are a great band\nwith the potential to do so much more. Plus,\nthe finale of final song \u2018Grew up at Midnight\u2019\nsounds exactly like that of \u2018Sea Within a Sea\u2019\nby The Horrors.\nLily Le\n\n"

Things get more\ncomplicated when Marcy May\u2019s older sister\nLucy (Sarah Paulson) calls her Martha. Another flashback sees the female protagonist\nbeing called Marlene.

It\u2019s what follows after her eventual\nescape that grips us from start to finish. Having been trapped in her strict, psychosexual\ncult for around two years, the normal outside\nworld is a difficult one to fit back into. It\u2019s the\nlittle things that add up to Martha being portrayed as a complete lunatic. When she goes\nfor a swim, she does so completely naked,\nsomething that is not tolerated in the normal\nworld.

He is a master manipulator, first welcoming his new recruits with a smile. Things\ntake a dark turn as he expects the women to\nsleep with him: they are fooled into thinking\nthat this is the right thing to do, whilst in fact\nthey do not actually have a say in the matter.\nHawkes is such an effective villain, so charming in the beginning to almost woo the young,\nclueless Martha, and yet turning into a ruthless leader within a matter of seconds, whilst\nkeeping his appeal intact. It\u2019s a superb performance in a crucial role, and we understand\nwhy Martha fears the man so greatly, and it\nseems almost too possible for this smart guy\nto catch up on Martha\u2019s whereabouts.\nSo concerned with the film\u2019s atmosphere\nrelating to the heroine\u2019s never-ending crisis\nwith the nightmare that terrorises her every\nday, it seems as though the director forgot to\ngive this a proper, satisfying ending.

It seems harmless at first, as the leader\nof the camp, the charismatic Patrick (John\nHawkes) seems like a perfectly ordinary guy.\nBut as he asks his crew to shoot live kittens\npoint-blank, exploits members to take part\nin many group sexual acts, and readily gives\npermission for murder, alarm bells start ringing for Martha, which prompts her to turn her\nback on the strange cult. But it\u2019s the paranoia\nthat keeps the poor heroine from having a normal life: afraid that she has not fully escaped,\nand with dreams and constant reminders that\ncreate an unbearable environment for Martha\nto live in, no matter where she goes or who\nshe turns to.\nOlsen, the less famous younger sister of the\nOlsen twins, puts on an astonishing debut\nperformance as the damaged young girl, always so weak and vulnerable, petrified at the\nprospect of what might happen to her if she is\nnot careful.

    "content": "POLITICS\nBy the end of the year, Americans will have\nelected a new President. However, with no\nclear majority in public opinion for either the\nDemocrats or the Republicans, who will become the next Leader of the Free World? Who\nwill answer the call from visiting extra-terres-trial dignitaries?\nThe main focus of the country is the Republican Nominee election. So far, having lost such\nluminaries as Michelle Bachmann, billionaire\nDonald Trump, Jon Huntsman, and former\npizza boss Herman Cain, the list of competitors\nhas been whittled down to Mitt Romney, Newt\nGingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul.\nThe current Republican nominees are being\nput through their paces by a number of Primaries and Caucuses, events where Republican\nvoters in each state can put their vote behind\na nominee of their choosing. Each extra notch\non their belts brings a contender one step closer\nto becoming the Republican Presidential can-didate.\nSince the start of 2012 there have been three\nprimaries in the states of Iowa, New Hampshire\nand South Carolina in which the candidates\nhave frantically jostled for the position of Top\nDog. Starting off the fight the caucus in Iowa\nwas held on January 3 with a narrow eight-vote\nvictory going to former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, followed by former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney after a vote\nre-count. The next battle was fought at the New\nHampshire primary, where Mitt Romney took a\ndouble-digit lead in votes, emerging as a clear\nleader in the contest. Upon winning, Romney\nspread a message of party unity, hoping to end\npersonal attacks between nominees. At the time\nMitt Romney was seen as the top candidate for\nthe position of Republican nominee and it was\nseen as a foregone conclusion that he would\ndominate further Primaries. However, this\nchanged after the re-count in Iowa and a shocking thirteen-point victory by Newt Gingrich in\nthe more socially and religiously conservative\nstate of South Carolina. With three primaries\nproducing three separate winners, the Republican Presidential nominee elections have become a free for all.\nSo, what now? The next primary will be held\nin Florida on January 31. This election might\nbecome a turning point in the race, with the\npossibility of securing the prominence of the\nlatest primary winner Newt Gingrich, a former\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, or\ngiving more ground to Mitt Romney who has\nrecently suffered public embarrassment for being reluctant to reveal his most recent tax returns to the public. It could also give Rick Santorum or Congressman Ron Paul a chance to\nget a foot in the door.\nRick Santorum is trying to gain momentum.\nAfter being declared the winner of the Iowa\ncaucus, he has struggled to gain a larger support base, only receiving 17% of votes in the\nrecent South Carolina primary. Along with\ntrying to discredit the electability of the two\nmost popular candidates, he sells himself as a\nconservative who\u2019s heart beats in time with the\nRepublican party. However, he has neither the\nmoney of his two leading competitors, nor a\nprominent organisation in the state to which he\ncan ally himself. Finally, with Florida lacking\nstrong conservative or evangelical Christian\nbases, his hard approach and conservative antiabortion and anti-homosexual agenda may not\ngain many additional votes.\nCongressman Ron Paul has had a difficult\ntime in the nominations so far. Despite a stable and sensible approach, a lack of common\nground with the main line of the Grand Old\nParty means that he has had a hard time gaining votes in the Primary elections. In a strategic\nmove, Paul has decided to skip the Florida primary and concentrate his attentions elsewhere.\nMitt Romney\u2019s defeat in South Carolina\nhas shaken some of his support in the party.\nSome are shocked that he was unable to successfully parry attacks on his business past,\nfinding it hard to understand how he could not\nshield himself from attacks on a history that\nepitomises some of the strongest principles in\nthe capitalist-loving Republican Party. However Romney has started to fight back, having\nreleased his tax returns for the last few years\non Tuesday and also preaching a new message\nof tax reduction for the masses. He also has a\nsecret weapon; his campaign staff in Florida\nhave already been running a marathon for the\nlast fortnight, having already spent $7m on\nadvertising in the state. They have publicised\nhis causes so ruthlessly that as the other candidates have turned to Florida they have faced\na state where 197,271 early and absentee votes\nhave been counted with Romney leading in the\npolls on Monday. However, there is some discontentment with Romney\u2019s tax returns, after\nadmitting that he expects to have paid a mean\nof 14.6% tax on his income over the last two\nyears. Some consider him an out of touch mil-lionaire, who as President would be unable to\nunderstand the needs of the general populace.\nThere is also some confusion over his position\nat private equity firm Bain Capital, both issues\ncausing some to doubt Romney\u2019s economic\ncredibility. If Mitt Romney wants to become\nhis party\u2019s darling, he will have to pull of a stellar performance in the Florida primaries and\nshow the Republicans that he is a strong leader\nand a far superior contender.\nNewt Gingrich has shown twice that he can\nrevive a flagging campaign, most recently\nFighting for Florida\nA tough choice for Republicans: behold the diverse range of old, rich white men\nsnatching victory from the jaws of defeat in\nSouth Carolina. However his most pressing\nneeds as he looks towards Florida are to assert\nhis position on a number of subjects as well\nas weathering a host of personal attacks. Discrediting opponents is a key part of American\nelections, with this being no different. Newt\nGingrich has a strong competitor in Mitt Romney and has already used a $5m donation to his\n\u201csuper Political Action Committee\u201d to launch a\nslew of advertisements ripping into Romney\u2019s\nperceived weaknesses. However after three\nmarriages (involving two extramarital affairs)\nand a Speakership in the House of Representatives ending in resignation and a fine by the ethics committee, Gingrich has many issues that\ncould be of political benefit to his opponents\nand does little to endear him to social and religious conservatives. While decried as a balloon\nfull of hot air and a poor team player by his\nopponents, Newt Gingrich is trying to reinvent\nhimself as a reformed, honest man who plans to\nde-throne President Obama and heal America.\nHowever Gingrich has some demons to face in\nFlorida. As a former advisor to the bank Freddie Mac, an institution credited with a key part\nin the real estate crash in Florida, he will have a\nhard time gaining favour from the home crowd.\nThe race for the Republican Presidential\nNominee promises to be long and arduous, finishing with the selection of a single candidate at\nthe Republican National Convention on August\n27. However, as we approach February and the\nFlorida primary the Republican Party is fractured and undecided, with many contemplating\nwhether to vote for the candidate they prefer\nor bite the bullet and vote for a candidate they\ndespise but whom they feel will have the best\nchance of ousting Obama.\nAnd while the Republicans squabble over\nwho will be team captain, things are much\ncalmer in the Democrat camp. With many\nwary of the credibility of any chosen Republican nominee, the President is having a slightly\nless publicised sting campaign. On Tuesday he\ngave his State of the Union address where he\npromised a blueprint for long term economic\nstability in America and pushed for an increase\nin taxes for the wealthy as well as measures to\nstimulate job growth and education.\nFELIX\nFriday 27 january 2012\n14\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics Editors: Rajat Jain\nJoseph Letts\nLast Friday, gunmen bombed police stations\nacross the northern city of Kano before taking to\nthe streets to gun down pedestrians. At least 178\npeople have been killed by the attacks in Nigeria\u2019s\nsecond largest city. The terror group Boko Haram\n(Non-Islamic education is a sin) took full respon-sibility.\nBoko Haram, which has only been active since\n2002, said the attacks were in retaliation for the\ngovernment imprisoning many of their members.\nTheir broader raison d\u2019\u00eatre, however, is to end\nsecular democracy in Nigeria and replace it with\nShari\u2019ah law. Their growing power has lead to fears\nthat Nigeria may be heading for a civil war. Many of\nthe group\u2019s members trained in Somalia \u2013 this reflects an emerging trend of unity between Islamic\ngroups across Africa and has African leaders growing increasingly concerned. If Nigeria cannot control Islamists, other governments worry, how does\nanyone else in Africa stand a chance?\nWith Africa\u2019s largest population (125m), third\nlargest economy, and fourth highest growth rate\n(8.4%), Nigeria has long been described as the\n\u201cGiant of Africa\u201d and is part of Goldman Sachs\u2019\n\u201cNext Eleven\u201d high growth countries (after the four\nBRIC countries). It has also been a centre of film\nand music for much of Africa as well as a regional\npeacekeeper and force for stability.\nThe rise of Boko Haram, however, reflects a\nfundamental problem within Nigeria with lessons\nfor leaders both inside Nigeria and the rest of\nAfrica, to avoid falling to extremists. The biggest\nproblem is Nigeria it is not a nation \u2013 it is 250\nethnic groups with different religions, languages\nand customs placed in a common state by the\nBritish and left to its own devices when it gained\nindependence in 1960. Rather than encourage\nunity around common ideas, successive military\ngovernments tried to hold the country together by\nforce before respecting the federal system which\ntries to gain peace through appeasement. Giving\neach of the 37 states a high degree of autonomy\nallowed the Muslim-dominated North to introduce\nvarying degrees of Shari\u2019ah law while the Christian\ndominated South remains secular. Further, there\nis an unwritten rule that the presidency must alternate between a Muslim and Christian. Far from\nbringing long term stability, such moves encourage and legitimise divisions.

    "content": "The contrast with the trenches is astounding.\nThe war is dark, muddy, loud. The country is\ndistorted. Everywhere, destruction and death\nare present. The trenches rob the men of their\nhumanity, their life and leave them empty. It\nfeels like a Sassoon or Rosenberg poem has\nbeen brought to life. Stephen Wraysford is un-recognisable. The sheer scale of the Great War\nis awe-inspiring, especially in the army hospital where corpses are aligned and the amputees are taken care of. Our hero is right in the\nmiddle of it, as a lieutenant. The only escape\nhe has left from the daily violence and danger,\nfrom insanity, is his memories from that summer six years ago, and Isabelle.\nRedmayne and Po\u00e9sy are splendid. The\nchemistry between them and their talent carry the drama and give it depth and emotion.\nThere isn\u2019t much dialogue, but every look\nsays something. This adaptation may have\ntaken decades to achieve, the result is stun-ning. The depiction of the war is a fantastic\nreproduction, in my opinion, fair to descrip-What the editors thought\nWe had high hopes for this. We really did. The\nBBC are good at this sort of thing \u2013 period drama,\nromance, and some conflict thrown in for good\nmeasure. We can\u2019t argue with the quality of the\ncinematography because it was \u2013 as is usually the\ncase with this sort of programme on the BBC \u2013 su-perb. The mood created is described perfectly by\nMarie-Laure Hicks in her review of the show.\nThere was a certain synergy between Po\u00e9sy and\nRedmayne that was believeable and quite endear-ing.\nHowever, the show is not without fault, the main\nissue we had with the first episode was how long\nit took for things to get going (we\u2019re talking geological timescales here); certain levels of tanacity\nwere required to continue watching after enduring\nthe first half. Things did start to pick up though,\nparticularly towards the end where the times between scenes at war and those set in the summer\nwhich Stephen spent with Isabelle decreased. It\ncertainly added a heightened sense of drama to\nthe occasion.\nTalking of heigtnened senses; whilst adding a\nlittle interest to the episode, the sex scene was a\ntad ridiculous, Isabelle and Stephen had only just\nkissed before he went down on her. Maybe that\u2019s\njust how he rolls... Besides, we\u2019ll let them off as\nCl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy alone makes for good viewing.\nOverall we thought Birdsong was alright. Perhaps\nbest described as somewhat flaccid. It just sort of\nhappened; it wasn\u2019t great but it certainly wasn\u2019t\nterrible either. Maybe its downfall was the timing\n\u2013 had it not started a week after the brilliant Sherlock ended then perhaps we would have viewed it\nin higher esteem.\nWill we watch the next episode? Probably. There\nwere aspects we liked enough to merit giving it\nanother opportunity to impress us. We\u2019ll let you\nknow next week.\nFollowing Sherlock and Great Expectations, another one of Britain\u2019s favourite nov-els, Birdsong has been adapted for the small\nscreen by the BBC. The first part was broadcast last Sunday. The book, written by Sebastian Faulks, is considered a modern retelling\nof the Great War. Set in pre-war Amiens and\nthe Somme trenches, it chronicles parts of the\nlife of Stephen Wraysford and his affair with\nIsabelle Azaire.\nThe BBC adaptation opens in the trenches\nwith Wraysford, portrayed by Eddie Redmayne, and moves back and forth between the\nwar and 1910 as the Englishman recalls his\nsummer in Northern France. The young man\nwas then staying with the Azaires, a wealthy\nfamily. He is young, still discovering the joys\nand beauties of life. Isabelle Azaire (Cl\u00e9mence\nPo\u00e9sy) is locked in a loveless marriage to an\nolder man. Together, they discover the passion\nof love.\nThe drama is defined by atmospheres,\nglances, not words. A look, a touch is all that\nis needed to convey such thoughts and feel-ings. Better than a million words. The pre-war\nsetting is almost idyllic. Calm, beautiful, full\nof life and nature, it is comparable to being\nplunged into a Debussy piece or an Impressionist painting. The light and brightness render a poetic, dream-like ambiance, ideal for a\nlove story.\ntions of those who lived it. The realities of the\nwar are there. The wounded and the dead are\nomnipresent. The audience is taken into the\nmuddy trenches, the tunnels. It encounters the\ndangers and risks, the constant bombing and\nguns firing. This place is impersonal, madden-ing, so far away from the innocence and bliss\nof peaceful times.\nWritten by Abi Morgan (Brick Lane, The\nIron Lady, Shame), the main discrepancy with\nthe book is that sections including Wraysford\u2019s\ngranddaughter in 1970s Britain have been cut\nin order to concentrate on the love affair and\nthe historic events surrounding it. The show\nalso provides a look into the world of tun-nellers, a less well-known aspect of this war.\nAt the time of the story, there would have been\ntwenty-five thousand men creating a network\nof tunnels spanning hundreds of miles.\nIn the words of Edward Thomas, \u201cCan you\nremember?\u201d As fewer and fewer survivors re-main, the Great War should not be forgotten.\nNot only in memory of those who died fight-ing, but also the horror and destruction. The\ndrama provides a chance to retell and document this period. It brings it to life and reminds\nthe audience of the dreadful nature of war.\nThis story of violence, love, friendship, death\nand life is quite simply a journey through time,\nplaces and people; a great experience.\nCatch the second part of Birdsong on Sunday at 9pm on BBC1\nI\u2019m rather ravishing, don\u2019t you think?\nMarie-Laure Hicks\n\u201cThe light and brightness\nrender a poetic, deam-like ambiance, ideal for\na love story\u201d\nTELEVISION\nFELIX\nFriday 27 january 2012\n30\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTelevision Editors: George Barnett\nJames Simpson\n\u201cHow sweet and fitting it is to die for one\u2019s country\u201d\nBirdsong\nWe also enjoyed former Television Editor Matt\nAllinson\u2019s brief appearance.

Kodak is now calling for a $950m\nbankruptcy loan, a call which seems to have\nbeen answered by the Citibank lending syndi-cate.\nEastman Kodak, or \u2018Kodak\u2019 as it is most\ncommonly known, was founded in 1899 by\nGeorge Eastman in Rochester, New York. In\n1900 it introduced to the American public\nthe Brownie camera, the first camera to be\nproduced and sold en masse. Innovation and\nmass production were about to put the world\ninto cars and airplanes, the American Century was unfolding, and Kodak was ready\nto record it. From that moment onwards, the\ncompany continued to grow: in 1976, Kodak\ncommanded 90% of film sales and 85% of\ncamera sales in the US. In 1975, Kodak invented the world\u2019s first digital camera.\nSo, how did a company with such a glorious history find itself in such a disastrous financial condition? According to some, it was\nexactly that \u2013 their history \u2013 which can be\nheld responsible. Robert Burley, an associate\nprofessor from Toronto\u2019s Ryerson University said of Kodak, \u201cThey were a company\nstuck in time. Their history was so important\nto them, this rich century-old history, when\nthey made a lot of amazing things and a lot\nof money along the way. Now their history\nhas become a liability\u201d. Kodak actually did\nforesee the digital revolution coming to a\ncertain extent, and made a number of investments in this field. However, Kodak could\nnot figure out a business model in the digital\nera that produced the same returns that investors expected based on its film-based industry history. Its first digital product was a\nproduct called Photo CD, launched in 1992,\nwhich still kept film as the capture media\nand then digitized them and saved them on\na CD through the use of specific scanners.\nThe product was largely unsuccessful and,\nmore importantly, resulted in Kodak being\ndistracted by it from the digital photography\nrevolution occurring in Silicon Valley at the\ntime.\nSigns that Kodak\u2019s monopoly wouldn\u2019t\nlast forever could however already be seen\nthrough the way it handled its rivalry with\nFujifilm in the eighties and early nineties.\nAlthough Japanese Fuji entered the U.S.\nmarket with lower-priced film and supplies,\nKodak refused to believe that American consumers would betray its sacred brand. This\nlack of foresight and excessive trust in the\nbrand led, often, to ill decision making, such\nas when Kodak passed on the opportunity\nto become the official film of the 1984 Los\nAngeles Olympics. Fuji obtained the sponsorship rights and, also thanks to intensive\nmarketing and price cutting, started taking\nKodak\u2019s market share, which increased from\n10% in 1990 to 17% five years later.\nThus, as a result of lack of foresight and a\nseries of wrong financial calls, Kodak now\nfinds itself filing for bankruptcy. As Don\nStrickland, ex VP of Kodak Digital Imaging\nstated last week, \u201cKodak\u2019s mission statement has always been to be the world leader\nin imaging, and as a consequence of the digital revolution there is no longer a business\nin imaging.\u201d\nIf successful, Kodak\u2019s move will allow it\nto emerge as a smaller company, with fewer\nemployees and a change of focus to something very different to what the name Kodak\nsymbolizes to many people. Antonio Perez,\ncurrent CEO of Kodak, believes filing for\nbankruptcy was a necessary step on the path\ntowards achieving this, as he stated after the\nmove was announced: \u201cThe board of directors and the entire senior management team\nunanimously believe that this is a necessary\nstep and the right thing to do for the future\nof Kodak.\u201d\nIs it, then, the end for Kodak? Probably\nnot. After it will sell off its intellectual property assets and boost its cash position, the\nBankruptcy...\nA Kodak Moment?\nPaolo Strampelli of the Imperial Entrepreneurs charts the history of a\ncompany that has struggled to keep apace with the times\nRochester-based former giant will mutate\ninto a smaller company, which will be built\naround printers and ink. Since being elected,\nAntonio Perez has steered the company away\nfrom its traditional focus on cameras. Instead, Perez believes that Kodak\u2019s only hope\nis to specialize in these markets, investing in\ntechnologies that would give it an advantage\nover competitors in the field and allow it to\nget back in the game. Diversification (which\nin the past saved Fuji from a situation very\nsimilar to that of Kodak) could also be an\nimportant chapter in Kodak\u2019s new business\nplan, with medical imagining markets and\nhealth markets some of its possible targets.\nOne thing we can however be sure about:\nKodak will not be forgotten. Its yellow boxes of film and point-and-shoot cameras made\nit possible for countless millions to freeze-frame their memories forever, and allow us\nto remember and define what an entire century looked like. Nevertheless, even if it succeeds and another smaller company emerges\nfrom the bankruptcy proceedings, it seems\nunlikely there is going to ever be another\n\u2018Kodak moment\u2019.\nSign up for the Imperial Entrepreneurs\nmailing list at: imperialentrepreneurs.com\nIn the Season 1 finale of the critically acclaimed\nUS drama Mad Men, man\u2019s man Don Draper is assigned with reinventing The Wheel, Kodak\u2019s new\n\u2018continuous\u2019 slide projector. The projector is an\napt metaphor for it\u2019s owning company: good qual-ity, but hardly innovative \u2013 as media buyer Harry\nCrane puts it, the only benefit of the new device\nis that \u201cit sells projectors to people who already\nhave them\u201d.\nBack in the 60s, when the show is set, Kodak were\nable to rest on the laurels of a strong brand name,\nbuilt over their long history and from a dominant\nposition in the photographic film market. Their\nadvertisements from the time were less than\ninspiring: dreary, black-and-white affairs, most\nbore more resemblance to user manuals than attempts to seduce the buying public. However, in\nspite of this, Kodak were able to sell their prod-ucts, and by the 1970s had managed to build a\n90% market share.\nWhen Mad Men premiered in 2007, Kodak was\nin a very different shape. Growing numbers of customer complaints were a symptom of the worsening health of the company, as quality control\nand customer relations took hits in their effort to\nfind a niche in the digitised environment. Through\nDraper, the Mad Men writers were able to reassess Kodak\u2019s relationship with its past. Reframing\n\u2018history\u2019 as \u2018nostalgia\u2019, they shifted the emphasis\nfrom the company to the consumer; instead of requiring the buying public to connect with Kodak\u2019s\nown brand history, Draper shows how a brand can\nconnect the buyer to their own past. He is pitch-perfect \u201cIt\u2019s not called the wheel, it\u2019s called the\ncarousel. It lets us travel the way a child travels \u2013\naround and around, and back home again.\u201d\nKodak must now attempt such a change of fo-cus. They have the benefit of a nostaliga for the\ndays of red and yellow boxes of film, though for\nKodak to return \u2018back home\u2019 to the times of market dominance looks unlikely.\n\u2013 The Business Editors\nFELIX\nFriday 27 january 2012\n16\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBusiness Editors: Nina Kearsey\nBe\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nBUSINESS\nCould Kodak have a shot at survival?\n\u201c\n\n"

You\ncannot arrest an idea.\nYou CAN expect us.\u201d\nThese are the words of decentralised\nhacktivist online group Anonymous,\ntweeted as they launched a hailstorm of\nDistributed Denial of Service (DDOS)\nattacks on various websites just hours\nafter the US Government shut down\nMegaupload.com on Thursday 19 January. Their attacks successfully brought\ndown websites belonging to the RIAA,\nMPAA, Universal Music, the Department of Justice, the US Copyright Office, EMI, the FBI and others by flooding them with requests, but a number\nof outlets have begun accusing them of\nfalling head first into a trap.\nThursday\u2019s wave of activity saw the\nlargest coordinated attack in the history of Anonymous, with over 9000 participants \u2013 both willing and oblivious.\nUnsurprisingly, their efforts have been\nslated as counterproductive, with claims\nthat the US government had deliberately timed the Megaupload takedown\nto occur directly after the SOPA protests\nwhere Wikipedia, Wordpress and various websites underwent a blackout to\nraise awareness against provisions in\nthe acts.\nIf this is true, then it is plausible that\nnot only did the US Government take\nheed of Anonymous\u2019s words, to \u201cexpect\nus\u201d, but that they also considered such\nactions may play in their favour by overshadowing the peaceful and lawful protests from all the websites blacking out\nlast week. Popular tech website CNET\u2019s\nMolly Wood reported that \u201cif the SOPA/\nPIPA protests were the web\u2019s moment\nof inspiring, non-violent, hand-holding\ncivil disobedience, [the move by Anonymous] feels like the unsettling wave of\ncar-burning hooligans that sweep in and\nincite the riot portion of the play.\u2019\u2019\nIt is likely that this would be ripe\nammunition for the US government to\nuse against freedom on the internet and\nI think this will cause them to call for\ntighter internet controls to crack down\non what they perceive as cyber-terror-ism, and at the very least, may provide\nemotional motivation for them to do so.\nLord what a mess \u2013 A letter to the editor\nSOPA: who got the last lulz?\nThe websites blacked out on Thursday\nto protest against provisions in the Stop\nOnline Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect\nIntellectual Property Act (PIPA) bills,\nwhich threatened the health of the inter-net. If they went through, the US government would have the ability to order\nISPs to alter their DNS servers from resolving the offending websites, to force\nsearch engines like Google to modify\ntheir results to exclude such sites, and\nso on. Outright censorship. I\u2019m not an\nadvocate of piracy, though I believe in\nfreedom of speech and believe the internet is our safest place to express this.\nI\u2019d heard of Megaupload through\nMegaVideo. It was notorious for limiting videos to 72 minutes, and I was\nfirmly aware that it was a site mostly\nused to transfer pirated files. It wasn\u2019t\ntoo long before people discovered how\nto make their film nights more convenient in first year, circumventing the\nMegaVideo limit by simply switching\nfrom the Imperial wireless connection\nto a wired one.\nWhile some people did use Megaupload to illegally pirate files, it must be\nnoted a great deal of users had legitimate intent, for instance transferring\nfiles which were too big for E-mail. I\nbelieve the US\u2019s rash decision to take it\ndown without warning was completely\nunjustified, and there has been emphasis\nlately on users who wonder what happened to their files.\nThis raises another interesting question regarding cloud services: why\nMegaupload and not, for example, Rapidshare? In fact, Rapidshare reportedly\nare \u201cnot concerned\u201d about the takedown,\nemphasising that they don\u2019t provide features such as a rewards system for frequently downloaded files. Rapidshare,\nDropbox and Windows Live SkyDrive\nall fall into the same category from a\ntechnical perspective, and a fair proportion of us use these services regularly.\nWhat happens to our files if a service is\ntaken down?\nMegaupload\u2019s servers contained\nmore than 25 petabytes of data (over\n25,000,000 gigabytes), personal files,\nand I\u2019m appalled at their availability being so abruptly withdrawn. Your music\nlibrary is your personal soundtrack to\nDear Editor,\nI would like to protest in the weakest\npossible terms against the total disregard Felix shows for the correct style\nof address of Peers of the Realm.\nReferences to life peers \u201cLord\nRobert Winston\u201d, \u201cLady Eliza Manningham-Buller\u201d and others regularly\nappear despite being hideously im-proper.

For\nthis, I think that cloud backup and storage are not real substitutes to their local\nequivalents, and while Megaupload had\na lot more problems than piracy (their\nemployees were accused of money\nlaundering and trafficking), I\u2019m hesitant\nto store mission critical data up there in\ncase of some kind of amalgamation of\nMurphy\u2019s law and freak unavailability.\nMore to the point, now all those 25\npetabytes are in the possession of the\nfeds, it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll go through as\nmuch of it as possible to secure a con-viction. It\u2019s also likely that IP addresses of uploaders were logged too. See\nwhere I\u2019m going with this? Privacy is\ncompletely out the window, and the US\ngovernment nonchalantly demonstrated\nthey didn\u2019t really need SOPA anyway.\nNow while I disagree with these vio-lations, I must also disagree with some\nmethods used by Anonymous to DDOS\nthe affected websites after Megaupload\nwent down. The attacks were conducted\nby the aptly named Low Orbit Ion Cannon program (C&C gamers will get the\nreference), a piece of software initially\nwritten by the \u2018\u2019good guys\u2019\u2019 to perform stress tests and load balancing on\nnetworks. The software was later open\nsourced and people began voluntarily\nusing it to flood websites with connection requests, causing them to overload and go down. It even has a \u2018\u2019Hive\nMind\u2019\u2019 mode, where the program acts as\nJust because the BBC and others\nroutinely fuck it up doesn\u2019t mean Felix has to.\nBest wishes,\nChristopher Kaye\nJunior Treasurer\nICU History Society.\nYour music library\nis your personal\nsoundtrack to\nyour life,a photo\nis potentially an\ninstance of a\ntreasured memory...\ntake away access\nto all my files today\nand you\u2019ll be taking\naway my life\na slave and accepts commands originating online, allowing for increased coor-dination.\nThough use of this tool on other websites equates to criminal activity, it can\nbe said that everyone who participated\nwas doing so of their own free will.\nThis was, unfortunately, not the case\nfor some unsuspecting users, since the\nprogram was modified to work using\nJavaScript and the link was shortened\nand distributed throughout Twitter under the Anonymous hashtag. This meant\nit could run inside a browser with no\ndownloads necessary and that the link\ncould be shortened to trick users into\nvisiting the page without realising what\nthey were getting into. It is claimed that\nmore than 27,000 computers were involved in the DOJ attack with \u201caverage\npeople participating in the DDOS attack from their living rooms\u201d. The stats\nwere, however, not broken down into\nthe amount of traffic from the voluntary\nprogram as opposed to the involuntary\nJavaScript link.\nSome Anonymous spokespersons\nresponded saying that \u201cpreying on unsuspecting users is despicable\u201d, and that\nthey \u201cneed to fight for the user, not land\nthem in jail\u201d, though we cannot be sure\nwho can speak for them and whose word\nto trust, due to their decentralised na-ture.

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 27 january 2012\n18\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nDuring the past week the Felix website\nhas seen some of its highest activity\never, as various members of College have\ntaken to our comment boards to voice\ntheir opinions over last week\u2019s report on\nthe potential closure of Clayponds. Demonstrating that the postgraduate voice\nat Imperial is very much alive and well, it\nshows that adjustments to college life are\nnot solely exclusive to one section of Imperial\u2019s community, but rather everyone.\nEven considering this, undergraduates\nmay be wondering why they should care\nabout postgraduate accommodation, especially if they have no intention of pursuing a postgraduate education. It is unwise\nto continue through an academic career\nat Imperial without awareness of the decisions that college takes on important\nissues such as Clayponds or the Holland\nClub, and the effects that it has on other\nhugely significant areas of college life.\nThere can easily be repercussions from\npostgraduates to undergraduates across\nthe college, as, obviously, the student\nbody is not rigidly divided.\nNeedless to say, Felix will report on\nthese issues and bring them to the attention of Imperial, especially when bodies\nsuch as the Union are incensed at what\nthey believe to be a lack of communication on the part of the college. It is important to remember that Imperial is not only\nmade up of undergraduates, nor solely\npostgraduates. Not every major story will\nrevolve around one particular area of col-lege. The fact that there have been so\nmany comment from those affected by\nthe Clayponds story cements the fact\nthat news has a reach across the entirety\nof Imperial.\nComments will continue to be made on\nupcoming stories as term unfolds. Consider your own input into the stories that\naffect you and ensure that you are aware.\nAfter all, as you are no doubt reminded,\nit\u2019s not all about academia here. Make\nthe most of your Imperial experience and\nunderstand what is happening around\nyou.\nHerein lies the point: exercise your right\nto respond to articles online, and in doing so keep the stories that matter to you\nat the forefront of college life. Consider\nwriting a comment article for this very paper about an issue that you find impor-tant. Whether Imperial-related or not, free\nopinion and expression is at the forefront\nof this paper.\nFELIX\nKeep a keen interest in\nthe latest college issues\nA\nfter finishing my undergraduate degree, I\u2019m\nnow in my fifth year at\nImperial studying for a\nPhD. Recent news about\nthe future of Clayponds and the Holland\nClub has led me to believe that Imperial\nis disconnected from the lives and needs\nof postgraduate students.\nThe college has confirmed that it intends to close Clayponds, the postgraduate student estate in South Ealing. Its\nreplacement is Griffon Studios, a new,\npurpose-built development offering\n\u201chigh quality and affordable accommodation options\u201d in Clapham. Unlike\nClayponds, there is no pastoral care system at Griffon Studios \u2013 a key benefit of\nliving in university accommodation that\nis particularly attractive to students new\nto London or the UK.\nA 19 square metre studio there will set\nyou back \u00a3235 per week. \u00a3300 per week\nwill get you a 22 square metre studio\nthat\u2019s apparently suitable for couples.\nIn contrast, a single room in Clayponds\nranges from \u00a3104-\u00a3148 per week and a\nsingle studio is from \u00a3181.\nTo put that in context, I\u2019m a postgraduate student in the Plastic Electronics Doctoral Training Centre and\nmy stipend is \u00a31299 per month. Living\nin the smaller studio would cost me a\nwhopping \u00a31018 per month and leave\nme with \u00a3281 for living costs. No wonder they haven\u2019t filled all the rooms. My\ngirlfriend and I privately rent a flat in\nSouthfields twice the size of Griffon\nStudios for \u00a3230 per week \u2013 a much better deal than anything Imperial offers.\nThe Rector responded to criticism\nfrom Clayponds subwarden Craig Court\nby saying that a focus group found students wanted to be within 30 minutes of\nSouth Kensington. Who doesn\u2019t? But\nnot at these obscene prices. Imperial\nappears to have completely forgotten\nto investigate what a typical PG can af-ford. Furthermore, in a move that will\nundoubtedly be a bitter blow to current\nClayponds residents, proceeds from its\nsale will be used to subsidise accommodation in Griffon Studios to the tune\nof \u00a325 per week. What is the point in\nbuilding new accommodation that is so\nexpensive it has to be subsidised from\nthe proceeds of selling existing housing\nthat has great feedback from residents?\nThe second development to cause me\nto doubt Imperial\u2019s commitment to PGs\nis the recent news that college catering\nis planning to convert the Holland Club,\nthe staff and PG bar in the basement of\nthe Sherfield building, into yet another\ncatering outlet. The response has been\noverwhelmingly in support of the Holland Club. At the time of writing, the\nSave the Holland Club Facebook page\nhas nearly 800 fans and there are 57\ncomments on a college announcements\nblog post \u2013 all against the plans.\nJane Neary, head of Commercial\nServices, told Felix that catering was\nunable to meet demand last year. How\ncan Neary explain that I can go into any\ncatering outlet at 1pm and find cabinets unfilled? I worked as a bookseller\nfor six years and when the shops didn\u2019t\nmeet customer demand, we didn\u2019t build\na new shop, we restocked the shelves or\nchanged the products. Perhaps catering\nshould try this approach before trying\nto assimilate a well-loved and excel-Imperial doesn\u2019t seem to\ncare about its postgrads\nGriffon Studios \u2013 the best a postgrad can get?\nlent place to drink into another soulless,\ndrab Taste Imperial clone?\nI can understand that Neary wants to\nprovide facilities for taught PGs, but\ndestroying the best place on campus for\nPGs to relax with colleagues and friends\n(and blag free beer off their supervisors)\nis not the way to go about it. At best,\ncatering\u2019s plans are misguided; at worst\n(and more cynically) it is an attempt to\nincrease the size of their food and drink\nmonopoly and make even more money.\nThere is a common thread running\nthrough both of these issues: Imperial\nneeds to become more aware of the financial realities of postgraduate life and\nneeds to listen more carefully to the\nneeds of students and, in the case of the\nHolland Club, staff. It is unacceptable\nthat the Union was not consulted about\nClayponds and that the bar manager,\nKevin Young, and the Holland Club\ncommittee were not consulted about\ncatering\u2019s plans from the very begin-ning. Postgraduates are responsible for\nthe bulk of the world class research that\nmakes Imperial the great institution it\nis. I urge the college management to not\nlet them down.\nWant to get\ninto an argument with\na stranger\nabout a\ndifference\nin opinion?\nWell, you\u2019re\nin luck. All\nyou need to\ndo is read\nthis on the\nnew invention\ncalled the\n\u201cinternet\u201d at:\nfelixonline.\nco.uk\nImperial appears\nto have completely\nforgotten to\ninvestigate what\na typical PG can\nafford.\n\u201c\nImperia\nImperia\nto have\nto have\nTom W Phillips\nYou.

Science is about taking rules, bending\nthem over your knee and beating them till they\nlearn to stop interrupting your progress.

In\nall honesty, I was expecting no-one would read\nthe piece, let alone send in a question. I think\nI\u2019m beginning to like you, test subjects.\nKeith asks, \u201cIf you had complete control over\nImperial\u2019s budget, what would you change and\nwhy?\u201d Firstly, I\u2019m not sure what the rate is between your funny British money and the dol-lar, but I\u2019m guessing that your college\u2019s budget\nis large enough to settle most of the civil suits\ncurrently against us, and then there may even\nbe enough left over to start paying the boys in\nthe lab. To be honest, they weren\u2019t too happy\nwhen they started being paid in \u2018Cave Dollars\u2019, Aperture\u2019s latest internal currency, after\nIOUs and the ill-fated spreading of our A.S.S.\n(Aperture Science Stock) options between em-ployees.\nOn the upside, the bean counters and the\nguys over in Legal said it was completely fine\nto print our own money, as long as we promised to actually pay them back with \u2018real money\u2019 at some point. With the current lab retention rate there\u2019s not even a need for a pension\nplan, so they\u2019re essentially working for free.\nSome people have likened Aperture to a dictatorship but I prefer to think of the lab boys\nas \u2018volunteers for Science\u2019, and I\u2019m Science.\nWith a capital S. They\u2019re free to leave at any\ntime. If they can make it out.\nConsidering that I get paid for every word\nthat I type for Felix, I\u2019ll try to answer the above\nquestion fully, and I won\u2019t tip-toe around the\nsubject. In this case, words aren\u2019t cheap and\nI\u2019m typing my way to science. I definitely\nwon\u2019t be padding out sentences with useless\nand superfluous words, just to get some quick\nbucks, nor will I spend a long length of time\nreminiscing about my days making shower\ncurtains. That reminds me of the time I made\na new waterproof shower curtain coating,\nbased off human skin. It didn\u2019t sell too well \u2014\nsomething to do with mutated flesh, and completely unfounded rumours about people being\nstrangled by their curtains when they weren\u2019t\nlooking. As a side note, I would advise against\nusing surviving test subjects of human-snake\nhybrid programmes, for tissue donations. I\nprobably wouldn\u2019t want to use the bodies of\nthe failed test subjects either.\nIgnoring the mountains of debt and the ongoing lawsuits, I would still want to spend all\nof the money on the progression of science.\nPixel Purge\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/\nview/547623\nAn old favourite of mine. Pixel Purge is one of those\ngames that\u2019s devilishly difficult to screenshot \u2013 a\nsecond away from the controls and you\u2019re being assaulted from all sides.\nYou man a spaceship, fighting a pixel army of\nvaried invadors. When they explode you grab their\npixelated remains to earn points and upgrade your\nvessel with bigger, badder weapons and improved\nhealth regeneration. The onslaught starts off slow-ly, put very quickly new enemies filter in, making\nsurvival a challenging task. Make sure you spend\nthose upgrade points wisely!\nQ \u2013 compressing the heart\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/\nview/588674\nI\u2019ll be honest here, I couldn\u2019t make head nor tale of\nthis game, though as a surreal piece I don\u2019t think\nyou\u2019re meant to. Q \u2013 compressing the heart is a\npoint and click puzzler that draws heavy influence\nfrom Limbo. The game does have its own miniature\nstyle though and, whilst not being particularly long,\nis a fun, if somewhat puzzling game to work your\nway through.\nLarge cash prizes to those offering Felix Games\nan explanation.\ncertified surgeon.

If you\u2019ve got\nno bones, and it\u2019s not due to a previous testing opportunity at Aperture Science involving\nour repulsion gels, then good news \u2014 we have\nmany new testing opportunities waiting for\nyou! However, I\u2019m afraid that if you\u2019re not a\ngiraffe we can\u2019t let you into that last test. Halfgiraffes are welcome to apply though.\nBack to the topic in hand, I would also look\nto cull the weakest of the Union\u2019s clubs, to\nreduce the expenditure of the college, and to\nensure that only the strongest of the societies\nsurvive. I propose a new series of tests at Aperture whereby we are able to pit clubs and societies against each other, to see how resilient\nyou are. There would be a range of tests, from\nassault courses and sporting activities (such as\ndodging some fast moving bottomless pits) to\npuzzle solving and staring competitions. The\nvictorious societies get to continue existing,\nand they may even get a small trophy. We\u2019ll\nsee how that goes.

Teams from Carshalton and Woking also took part.\nThe round robin tournament started with\na repeat of Imperial\u2019s last fixture against\nWoking College. Imperial started strongly,\nsetting up camp of the Woking try line but a\nlack of composure and a failure to finish sets\nmeant they came away with nothing to show\nfor their efforts. In a repeat of last week\u2019s\ngame Woking scored breakaway tries when\nImperial were in the ascendancy. It was later\ndiscovered that Woking were playing with\n10 rather than 9 players but they were still,\ncontroversially, awarded the victory.\nNext up were Carshalton and having just\nbeen beaten in such circumstances a fired up\nImperial took to the field. The game started\nwith hooker Stephen Dias dominating one\nof the Carshalton props in a tackle that belied his stature and scrum half Jack Neil taking down his opposite number with a tackle\nthat was felt on the side-lines.\nSoon after, Imperial\u2019s Alex Bukharin\nmade a strong run up the middle before an\naudacious chip over the line from Padhraic\nComerford set up the first of his tries in\nwhat was try of the tournament. Winger\nMing Wang-Koh continued the good play\nby running from touchline to touchline before showing his true pace, beating the Carshalton winger on the outside.\nSPORT\nFELIX\nFriday 27 january 2012\n46\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSport Editors: Indy Leclercq\nDavid Wilson\nWeb: www3.imperial.ac.uk/sports\nFacebook: Search \u2018Sport Imperial\u2019\nTwitter: @SportImperial\nA second try from Comerford shortly followed but Imperial then switched off and\ncomplacency allowed Carshalton to score\ntwo late tries and claim an 8-8 draw.\nWoking College, having such a large\nsquad, were able to field two teams and\nwere up again, the 3rd time Imperial would\nbe facing them in the two weeks. At halftime it was two tries all, the first from Imperial coming from Neil, who did well to\ncollect a wayward pass, the second coming\nfrom Wang-Koh; putting his cross-country\nlegs to the test after running three-quarters\nof the pitch to score his first try for Imperial.\nWith the game all square, Dias came off\nthe bench to play hooker and made an immediate impact by tackling Woking\u2019s winger into touch to save a try. This gave Imperial possession and straight from the restart,\nHamish Mackenzie managed to break the\nline and run in for his first try. Imperial were\nnot finished at that, Mackenzie showing his\npace to run in another try to get that revenge\non Woking College for the past two meet-ings.\nNext up for Imperial were Filton College,\nand after playing the previous 3 games\nwithout a break, this was the last team that\nImperial needed to play. Even though Filton had to travel half of the country to be\nin Guildford, they still had beaten everyone\nelse by at least 5 tries without conceding.\nThis was understandable with the size of\ntheir forwards and the pace and agility of\ntheir wingers yet Imperial stepped up to the\nplate. They produced some great plays including a step by Comerford that sent one\nof the large forwards to the ground. Filton\nwere constantly on the back-foot with Imperial coming so close to their try line but\nat the turnover Filton\u2019s wingers showed the\npace that Imperial were wary of to score\nthe first try breaking from under their own\nposts.\nThis didn\u2019t stop Imperial and after a few\nsets a piece for each team including some\nbig hits and a Sonny Bill style offload by\nhalf-back Neil, another counter attack from\nFilton resulted in a try in the dying minutes\nof the game. Filton would then go onto lifting the trophy so Imperial should take pride\nin this result, keeping the score so close.\nThe final game for Imperial was against\nFeltham College, which was sure to include\na few young offenders, as well as London\nBroncos academy players.\nImperial remained unfazed, however, and\nafter a hard fought battle which included the\ntwo smallest players for Imperial, Mackenzie and Dias chasing a Feltham player in\npossession for half the length of the pitch\nand performing a great double tackle to\nhold up the ball so that the Imperial defence\ncould retreat, Feltham managed to score\ntwo quick tries in succession.\nBy this point, the lack of numbers had\ncost Imperial dearly, unable to make as\nmany interchanges as most teams. Feltham\nmanaged to score again towards the end of\nthe game to end any Imperial challenge.\nAfter a hard fought day in Guildford, Imperial College Rugby League headed for the\ntrain back home with a couple of tinnys and\ntheir heads held high. Imperial\u2019s injured\nPresident David Hobson said: \u201cThe lads\nplayed really well today and with a little\nmore composure and experience we could\nhave been looking at competing in the fi-nal.

    "content": "Positive social change for Honduras\nS\neptember 1, 2011 was the\nday that I became a Global\nBrigader, and 11 am was\nthe time that I looked out\nonto the beautiful landscape of an undiscovered country and\nfell in love. I must admit that I joined\nGlobal Brigades because I thought it\nwould be a fun summer trip and, un-deniably, it was a fun summer trip!\nHowever, upon landing in Honduras,\nI swiftly realised that Global Brigades\nwould be so much more.\nThe definition of a brigade is \u201ca\ngroup of passionate volunteers who\nmobilise towards positive social\nchange\u201d. Honduran society is rife with\ncorruption, human rights abuse and a\ndespicably huge wealth gap. In other\nwords, the rich are getting richer and\nthe poor are getting poorer, neglected\nin parts of the country where malnutri-tion, poor housing and infant diseases\nare widespread. This is why in 2004\nGlobal Brigades launched in Honduras, as a source of hope for these forgotten communities.\nOn the first day of our medical bri-gade, eleven Imperial student volun-teers, our brigade leaders, Flaco the\ndriver, the doctors, the dentist, the\npharmacists, and Chuck the policeman\nall travelled to our designated commu-nity. We were warmly welcomed with\nrainbow-coloured balloons and a huge\nsign saying \u201cBienvenida!\u201d Most of the\nRe-live Ruby Ramjan\u2019s experience of last year\u2019s Global Brigades\n\u201cTo say that my experience was life-changin, but it is an\nunderstatement\u201d\ncommunity have no access to medical\ncare so, as a team, we brought medical care to them. Over three days, we\nserved 600 patients, promoted public\nhealth strategies to the adults of the\ncommunity, taught the children how\nto brush their teeth (and handed out\ntoothbrushes and toothpaste!), and distributed \u00a310,000 worth of drugs that\nwe, the Imperial brigade, took to Honduras.\nNothing warms my heart more than\na Honduran child. The afternoon we\nspent at the Nuevo Paraiso orphan-age, affiliated with Global Brigades,\nwas one of my personal favourites.\nOn walking through the gate, three\nadorable little girls ran up to me, one\nclutched my skirt, while the other took\none hand each. We played skipping\nrope games and swung on the swings\nuntil we were red in the face. Communicating in a mixture of broken Spanish and hand gestures, they introduced\nme to their friends, their playground\nand their rooms. Another dimension\nwas added to my passion for Global\nBrigades when I learnt that some of\nour Honduran brigade leaders had\nonce been that child at the orphanage\nclinging onto the gates of their home,\nwaving and blowing kisses as the volunteers would very reluctantly drive\nback to El Rapaco.\nEl Rapaco is a magical little condo\nin the mountains and our Honduran\nhome. Every evening we had siestas in\nthe hammocks, fiestas under the tree,\ndinner with Spanish music in the back-ground, constant inter-mocking of accents between us and the Americans,\nand random bursts of Salsa. There are\na thousand stories to tell, and while\nI could happily divulge every detail\nof my Global Brigades experience, I\ncould never convey the feeling of complete peace and undisputed happiness\nthat I felt in El Rapaco.\nI never fully comprehended the\nmeaning of the words \u201cmanual labour\u201d\nuntil we did the Public Health Brigade. The 11 Imperial students, along\nwith some local community members\nand masons, built a latrine, a stove,\na concrete floor and a pila in one of\nthe houses in the enchanting village\nof Zurzular. When I was first told we\nwere building a latrine (toilet), I assumed the last one was either not hygienic enough or it was falling apart:\nthe concept of not having a latrine is so\nforeign to me that it never even crossed\nmy naive mind, but that was indeed the\ncase for this elderly couple. The lady\nof the house told me that the old stove\nused to get so hot that her grandchildren have been burnt whilst playing in\nthe kitchen. We built a concrete floor\nbecause the plain earth that previously\nmade up the floor of their home was a\nparasite paradise.\nA pila is a water storage tank. Previously, the 80 year old man of the house\nhad to walk for hours to get his hands\non some clean water, then bring home\nas much as he could carry on his long\njourney back. \u201cIn just one week, students and the people from Global Brigades have helped me give my family\nessential things that I\u2019ve never been\nable to provide by myself. It was not a\ngift. I mixed concrete with you, I dug\nholes with you. We all sweated together\nand much of my savings has gone into\npaying my share for these projects. But\nyou were the resource that I\u2019ve never\nhad but have always needed.\u201d\nTo say that my experience was life-changing sounds like an exaggeration,\nbut it is an understatement. The captivating landscape, siestas, nightly fies-tas, bonfires, the warm and welcoming\nHondurans, our USA friends, discovering an undiscovered country: the list\nnever exhausts. Was it the gratitude\nof the hundreds of patients we saw in\nthe Honduran villages? Was it the contentment that goes hand in hand with\nvoluntary work? Was it the satisfaction\nof getting my hands dirty? Global Brigades gave me a thirst for more voluntary work and reignited in me the call\nof duty to humanity, a duty that I think\nwe forget too easily. As volunteers, I\nfelt we made a tangible impact to the\nrural communities we served: I could\nsee the happiness in the faces of the\nHonduran people around us, I could\nfeel the satisfaction in their warmth\ntowards us and I was certain of their\nappreciation when I noted their tears as\nwe said goodbye to them for the last\ntime.\n\u201cNothing warms my heart more than a Honduran child\u201d\nGlobal Brigaders have so much fun, working together to get the job done...\nFor more information on how you can get involved in a Global Brigades\nproject over the coming Summer:\nVisit Facebook: facebook.com/ICGMB\nSend an email: imperial.medical@globalbrigades.org\nVisit the website: globalbrigades.org\nTRAVEL\nFELIX\nFriday 27 january 2012\n40\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel Editors: Dushi Arumuganesan\nChris Richardson\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nFELIX Friday 27 january 2012 39\nJD Salinger \u2013 a troubled genius\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA tribute to a reclusive author...\nH\nolden Caulfield, Salinger\u2019s most auto-bio-graphical literary cre-ation, once said, \u201cWhat\nreally knocks me out\nis a book that, when you\u2019re all done\nreading it, you wish the author was a\nterrific friend of yours and you could\ncall him up on the phone whenever you\nfelt like it.\u201d Salinger, a man known for\nhis inaccessibility, was not going to\ngive his phone number away to his devoted readers. Instead, he gave them\na greater gift \u2013 the gift of a conversation with himself through his novels.\nFew authors in modern literature\nhave based their novels inside the\nlands of their own personal experience\nas much as Salinger. A brief review\nof his life story, or the story that can\nbe pieced together, is one that complies with the contours of his work.\nJerome David Salinger was born in\nNew York on January 1, 1919. He was\nborn into a Jewish family, although he\nlater discovered that he was only half\nJewish, his mother being Catholic. Salinger\u2019s father, a successful food im-porter, sent his underachieving son to\na Manhattan private school. However,\nthis was not to last long \u2013 Salinger\ndropped out within two years of en-rolling. This was to be the template for\nthe majority of Salinger\u2019s educational\nexperiences, including two ill-fated\nsemesters at New York University,\nwhich he attended after graduating\nfrom the Valley Forge Military School.\nSalinger\u2019s discontent with the academic world was to be translated\nonto page in the short story called I\u2019m\nCrazy, published in Collier\u2019s Weekly\nmagazine on December 22, 1945. I\u2019m\nCrazy centred on a disaffected youth,\nHolden Caulfield, who was going\nto be expelled from the prestigious\nPencey Prep school for failing his\nexams. This was later developed into\na full novel, The Catcher in the Rye.\nThis was not the first short story\nSalinger had published. In the autumn of 1939, Salinger enrolled in\na writing course that was taught by\nWhit Burnett, the founder and editor\nof Story magazine. Burnett first published The Young Folks, an acidic attack on the superficiality of student\nlife. Salinger\u2019s success was to be short\nlived, his upturn in fortunes coinciding with the attack on Pearl Harbor.\nFour months after the attack, Salinger was drafted into the US army.\nSalinger was part of the 4th Counter\nIntelligence Corps (C.I.C) detachment\nthat landed on Utah Beach, Normandy.\nSalinger was originally meant to be\npart of the first wave, at 6:30am; how-ever, an eyewitness report put him with\nthe second wave of attack. Whatever\ncaused Salinger\u2019s delay probably saved\nhis life \u2013 the first wave encountered the\nfiercest German defence. Maybe it was\nthis act of sheer fortune, of escaping\ndeath due to coincidence that gave Salinger\u2019s works such a fascination with\nfinding reason in a random world. One\nof Salinger\u2019s best pieces of unpublished\nwork, The Magic Foxhole, focused\ndirectly on Salinger\u2019s experience of\nNormandy. The Magic Foxhole opens\nwith the haunting image of a chaplain\nfrantically searching for his glasses,\nwhich were hidden beneath the corpses\nof Normandy beach. You don\u2019t have to\nbe Freud to understand the significance\nof this image \u2013 in Salinger\u2019s post war\nworld, God and Reason were things to\nbe challenged and analysed, not accept-ed. It is this conflict with finding reason in chaos that characterises the later\nworks of Salinger, from the death of\nHolden Caulfield\u2019s younger brother in\nThe Catcher in the Rye to the emotional distress seen in Franny and Zooey.\nThe effects of the war soon took their\ntoll on Salinger. The day the German\narmy surrendered, May 8, 1945, Salinger spent the evening alone, holding a\n.45 calibre pistol in his hands. Salinger\nwas soon admitted into a psychiatric\nward, suffering from clinical depres-sion. Little is known about this period\nof time; however; soon after his release he resumed writing short stories.\nA Perfect Day for Bananafish is\npossibly the best insight we have into\nSalinger\u2019s post war mental state. The\nstory revolved around a conversation\nbetween a young honeymooning war\nveteran and a child he meets on the\nbeach; the innocence of their conversation is juxtaposed with the horror\nof the veteran\u2019s own wartime experi-ence. After their conversation, the veteran returns home and ends his life.\nThen Salinger completed The Catcher in the Rye. Salinger was believed\nto be ill-prepared for the amount of\nattention the novel would bring him,\nand this turned an already traumatised,\nprivate and cynical man into a recluse.\nMuch has already been written about\nSalinger\u2019s reclusive nature, and I shall\nnot add to it. However, it is interesting to note that the last interview Salinger gave was to a couple of nearby\nschool children \u2013 who then sold the\ncontents of their interview to a news-paper. One can only speculate as to the\ndamage this caused a man who placed\njuvenile innocence on a pedestal. Salinger never gave another interview.\nJD Salinger died on January 27,\n2010.\n...and his greatest masterpiece\nJ. D. Salinger\u2019s only full length novel,\nThe Catcher in the Rye, has become\none of the 20th century\u2019s defining\nnovels, dealing powerfully and intelligently with the turbulent feelings of\nloneliness, alienation, and sexual confusion felt by so many during their\nadolescence. The book is narrated by\nHolden Caulfield, a teenage boy convalescing in a sunny Californian mental hospital, as he relates the circumstances that lead up to an unspecified\nmental breakdown he went through.\nHis story begins on a winter evening\nat the prep school he attended in Pennsylvania. With the holidays approach-ing, Holden has learned he has been\nexpelled, and finds himself alone and\nfrustrated in his dormitory while his\nschoolmates attend a football match.\nHolden is a boy that most people who\nhave experienced teenage years can relate to: weak, forgetful, self-obsessed,\nunsure of his own attractiveness, and\njealous of the achievements and supposed sexual conquests of his class-mates. As the evening progresses,\nwe witness the hostility Holden has\nfor the world around him, and will be\na constant theme of the book, as he\ngets in fights with his roommates for\nlittle reason. Feeling no point in staying at the school, Holden walks out,\nand takes a train to his home of New\nYork City, where he rents a hotel\nroom and tries to imitate an adult life.\nThe book is centered around a metaphor that Holden relates to the reader:\nhe day-dreams of standing in a field of\nrye growing on the edge of a cliff, wearing his red hunter\u2019s hat. Young children,\ntoo small to see over the rye, run blindly towards the edge, and Holden is the\nonly one who can catch them before\nthey destroy themselves. It is with this\nunforgettable, and justly famous, metaphor that Salinger reflects Holden\u2019s attitude towards life: through Holden\u2019s\nnarration, couched in the slang of a\nforties teenager, he derides the people\nand places around him as \u201cphonies\u201d\nJoseph Spiking looks back on the life of JD Salinger\n\u201c...he gave them a\ngreater gift \u2013 the gift\nof a conversation\nwith himself through\nhis novels.\u201d\nChristopher Reynolds\nand \u201ccrumby\u201d, believing that everyone around him is putting on an act.\nOnly his little sister is exempt from\nhis criticism, and it is she in particular\n\u201cHolden is a boy that\nmost people who\nhave experienced\nteenage years can\nrelate to\u201d\nThe Catcher in the Rye \u2013 the archetypical story of teenage disillusionment, confusion and rebellion\nthat he sees as one of the children running through the rye, peacefully living\nout her halcyon prepubescent years in\nthe rye before plunging off the cliff into\nthe tribulations of the adult world that\nhe himself feels so acutely. Holden\u2019s actions in the novel show him desperately\ntrying to find a place for himself in life.\nBy running away to New York and attempting to find people he can relate to\nin some way, he is trying to imitate the\nlives of the adults he sees around him,\nbut experiences only disappointment\nwhen he finds that he lacks the maturity to deal with the situations he puts\nhimself in. As the book progresses, and\nHolden gradually reveals the past experiences that have shaped the way he\nviews the world, it becomes clear that\nHolden is the one who needs saving before he plunges off a cliff that he himself is running towards, through the rye.\n\n"

Supporting the series\nof lectures by leading experts in fields\nrelating to climate change is a number\nof tutorial sessions where undergraduate from all the different departments\nJonathan Peek\nNEWS\nFELIX Friday 27 january 2012 3\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nof the college can discuss ideas raised,\ndevelop team working skills and explore the topic from other viewpoints.\nThe opening lecture was presented\nby Professor Sir Brian Hoskins, Director of Imperial\u2019s own Grantham institute for climate change and member\nof the UK\u2019s Committee on Climate\nChange: the committee tasked with\nadvising the Government on how it\ncan meet the 80% cuts in CO2 emissions by 2050 set out in the Climate\nChange Bill in November 2008. The\nlecture presented an overview of the\ntopic of Climate changing touching on\nearly work on the Green House gases\ndating back to early 1800\u2019s though to\nour current understanding of the driving principals behind climate change.\nTaking in the developments to how\nwe now study changes in the climate,\nwhat climate models are currently pre-dicting, and some of the controversies\nthat surround climate change \u2013 the\n\u2018Climate Gate\u2019 scandal based on email\nleak from the Climate research Unit\nand the \u2018errors\u2019 in the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC) report both of which made\nheadlines around the world. Concluding with a thought provoking slide on\nwhy trying to take any action about\nclimate change runs in to difficulty,\nthe lecture was a good summary of the\nunderlying issues of climate change\nand was a good opening to the scheme.\nThe lecture was followed by a tutorial that gave the undergraduates a\nchance to start exploring what policies\nthe Government should be bringing\ninto effect to help stop climate change.\nDiscussions as to why people were\ntaking part in the program was more\nthat people were interested in climate\nchange than the opportunity to develop their professional skills, with a lot\nof emphasis on the actual science behind the headlines in the media.\nWith the next lecture being presented by leading figures in the media the\nprogram looks set to hit its targets of\ngiving Undergraduates the chance to\nlook at climate change from a range of\nviewpoints.\nMembers of the House of Commons\nCommission have met to discuss options to deal with the subsidence problems that the Palace of Westminster is\nexperiencing. The palace, which was\nconstructed in 1870, is slowly sinking\ninto the ground, and the clock tower,\nwhich houses the infamous Big Ben, is\nleaning at an angle of 0.26 degrees.\nConclusions from the discussion were\nthat repairs should take place, though\nthese will not be until 2020 at the earli-est. The committee also stated that the\nPalace remains structurally sound.\nThis collaborates with the view of\nImperial College\u2019s Emeritus Professor\nJohn Burland. In an interview to Radio\n4, he made clear his opinion that the\nswaying of the tower is not a problem\nto worry about. He added that this has\nbeen a problem with the tower for many\nyears; the lack of cracks in the cladding\nsuggests it had swayed during its con-struction.\nHe also stressed that the construction\nof a car park and the Jubilee Line Extension under the palace has only affected the angle to the tower very slightly\n\u2013 these changes were controlled during\nconstruction.\nThese modern constructions have\nalso not caused the cracks seen in the\nbuildings. Regardless, the cracks may\nactually be beneficial \u2013 natural swaying\nin the building will concentrate around\ncracks, forming them if none exist. He\nis also \u201cnot in the least\u201d worried about\nthe possibility of the palace sliding into\nthe Thames.\nProfessor Burland has worked on a\nnumber of projects involving the pal-ace, the first of which was an underground car park. More recently, he had\na consulting role in the extension of\nthe Jubilee Line. This included work to\nstabilise the tower, which was at risk of\ncollapsing due to the close proximity of\nthe new Underground station.\nHowever, he is best known for his\nwork in stabilising the Leaning Tower\nof Pisa, a project that ended in 2001.\nIn gratitude for the part he played, the\nDuke of Castro made him a Knight\nCommander. Later, in 2005, he was\nmade a CBE for his part in reinforcing\nthe tower.\nSinking Westminster\nPhilip Kent\nImperial awarded for efforts in\nthe representation of women\nstaff. She also highlighted the Imperial\nCollege Early Years Education Centre (a childcare centre) which benefits\nwomen in academia who are raising a\nfamily.\nGoing back to 1999, Imperial was\nalso one of the founding members of\nthe Athena project, established by several bodies including the UK higher\neducation funding councils, Universities UK and the Office of Science and\nTechnology. Its aims are \u201cthe advancements and promotion of the careers\nof women in science, engineering and\ntechnology (SET) in higher education\nand research.\u201d\nThe 2010 Athena Survey of Science,\nEngineering and Technology (ASSET)\nof dozens of universities concluded\nthat \u201cwomen continue to feel disadvantaged and excluded in a number of\nways.\u201d One finding was that \u201cmale academics still predominate in positions of\nauthority.\u201d The survey also found that\nwhilst the gender-related differences\ntend to be small, they \u201caccumulate\nover the course of an individual career\nto create differences in opportunity and\nexperience.\u201d\nHowever, Patricia Hunt said, \u201cI personally believe that Imperial is doing\nmuch better than the survey might immediately make you think. After reading the ASSET survey I was very happy to be working at Imperial. I won\u2019t\nsay it is perfect, but definitely better\nthan some of the information coming\nout of the survey. What is needed now\nis the Government and funding bodies\ngetting seriously behind initiatives like\nAthena.\u201d\nImperial also has an exceptional\nachievement of Athena SWAN awards,\nwhich \u201crecognise and celebrate good\npractice on recruiting, retaining and\npromoting women in SET in higher\neducation.\u201d Imperial has obtained a\nbronze award, the achievement of\nwhich allows individual departments to\napply for awards. The Natural Sciences\nFaculty is leading the way within the\nCollege having obtained a silver award\nwithin the Chemistry department, a silver award within Physics and a bronze\naward within Life Sciences.\nThe Engineering faculty also boasts\nseveral awards with the Chemical Engineering and Materials departments\nhaving obtained silver awards, and\nthe Earth Science and Engineering\nand Computing departments having\nobtained bronze awards. Deputy Principal of Imperial, Dorothy Griffiths,\ndescribed this as a \u201chuge achievement\nin traditionally male dominated engineering fields.\u201d\nIn addition, the Department of Physics has also gained Juno Championship Status awarded by the Institute of\nPhysics. Project Juno was established\nby the institute in 2007 and aims to\n\u201crecognise and reward departments\nthat have taken action to address the\nunder-representation of women in university physics.\u201d\nAmong the range of female staff that\nFelix spoke to, none think that discrimination overtly exists within the\nCollege today. Whilst the percentage of\nfemale professors at Imperial is lower\nthan the national average of 20%, recently reported by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), Imperial is not faring too badly at all since\nscience, technology, engineering and\nmathematics (STEM) subjects have\nlong been dominated by males. It certainly seems that with the substantial\nefforts taking place within the College\nto support women, along with the rising ambitions of women, Imperial, and\nother universities, will continue to see a\nrise in the number of females in senior\npositions.\n...Continued from Front Page\n\u201cImperial has an\nexceptional achievement of Athena\nSWAN awards\u201d\nProfessor Burland has worked\non constructions at Westminster\nunderground station\nPhilip Kent\n\n"

    "content": "how it works. But I guess that\u2019s sort of the\nattraction for a lot of people, understanding what\u2019s going on and the satisfaction of\nknowing that for example the next three bars\nare going to be all messed up but you actually know all the notes. I don\u2019t really expect\nthat for a lot of the things I play. But it\u2019s\nnice every once in a while when someone\ncomes up and says, oh \u201cI enjoyed your music\u201d even if they don\u2019t have a clue what you\nwere doing, but that\u2019s fine because part of\nthe satisfaction is achieving that. You know,\nlike when you see someone get up on stage\nand they\u2019re thinking \u201coh, I\u2019m going to start\nplaying in fives now, just to be an ass\u201d and\nno one else will notice, right, because it just\ngets lost. But if it sounds good, it sounds\ngood.\nThat being said, in jam nights I rarely play\nmetal because metal\u2019s really hard to improvise well on. It often ends in tears. It\u2019s a lot\neasier to make interesting improve in jazz or\nsomething.\nEither that or it just ends up sort of psy-chedelic.\nYeah, if you have a looper it can be a lot of\nfun but in metal you just end up chugging\nalong on the same riff.\nAnd noodle a bit.\nYeah, the stereotypical solos as well\u2026\nI bumped into an old friend earlier, whose\nquite the metalhead and he was telling me\nabout a bit of controversy surrounding the\nupcoming Download festival. Apparently\nChase & Status are playing straight after\nMachine Head.\nElvis?\nI have no idea.\nI thought you were going to ask about more\ncapital D\u2019s besides dubstep.\nOh yeah, I wanted to talk about death.\nhaha none of our songs are about death ac-tually. A lot of them seem to be about the\nfinancial collpase, like \u2018Inflate/Deflate\u2019, because Laurie seems to have a real problem\nwith that.\nNice. So what\u2019s with the \u201cmorbid fascination of death\u201d to quote a certain Norwegian\nband?\nThat\u2019s like asking why most other music is\nobsessed with love? Some people might find\nthat just as insipid. I personally don\u2019t care.\nLyrics are just noise between solos, right?\nI think there are more offensive topics than\ndeath that are commonly dealt with.\nI\u2019m somewhat puzzled by what some people\nare capable of singing about.\nWell there\u2019s a band called Necrophagus,\nwhich refers to the practice of eating dead\npeople. I think that\u2019s part of the joke though.\nIt\u2019s not like some guy actually wants to each\nyour child. Another famous one is a song by\nBloodbath called \u2018Eaten\u2019 which is a guy who\nwants someone to find someone to eat him.\nIt\u2019s based on a true story about a German guy\nwho posted an ad in a newspaper a couple\nyears ago. That just shows that a lot of these\nthings are not that far beyond the realm of\nwhat happens in the world.\nI guess love and death are the central themes\nin our lives.\nLove sells more though.\nWhy do people care? You go to see one, the\nother or both.\nI have a feeling there are a lot of closet rav-ers among the metalheads.\nYeah, I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s controversial.\nWhat about The Prodigy playing alongside\nBlack Sabbath and Metallica?\nI would say Black Sabbath are less heavy\nthan The Prodigy, who use a lot of guitar\nsamples anyway. I think it\u2019s cool. It means\nthat they can guarantee enough of an audience for that sort of thing.\nApparently Lou Reed collaborated with\nMetallica.\nHe played some stuff on their latest album.\nI\u2019ve never listened to it but I\u2019ve always\nheard great things about Lou Reed\u2019s Metal\nMachine Music, which is basically 6 hours\nof clanging metal noises and feedback.\nMMM has influenced so much later music\nthat I almost don\u2019t feel the need to listen to\nthose records. Just the idea of it...\nYeah, I\u2019m sure you can recognise it in a lot\nof music.\nWhy do you think metal music is called\nmetal anyway?\nI don\u2019t know... it\u2019s really stupid but I always\nthought it was because rock was called rock.\nBut then I thought, well why call it rock?\nRock & roll...\nMaybe it\u2019s because metal is heavier than\nrock?\nHow does the rock roll? Like the pelvis of\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto on Big Muffs, dingy bars and\nclassical music with THROB\u2019s jazz-funk outfit\nHead down Spank Alley\nWho\u2019s in the Spank Alley?\nMatt: I\u2019m Matt, first year PhD student and I\nplay the drums\nJermyn: Jermyn, 3rd year Biochemistry, un-dergraduate. I play the saxophone.\nFaris: I\u2019m Faris. I\u2019m a 3rd year PhD student\nand I play the piano.\nJordan: Jordan, also 3rd year PhD. Bass.\nEugene: Eugene. I\u2019m a 3rd year undergrad\nChemist and I play the guitar.\nEugene, I have to ask you about your guitar.\nIt\u2019s just beautiful.\nIt\u2019s a 1965 Gibson hollow body. I bought it on\nDemark Street downtown, which is the worst\nplace to buy a guitar because they\u2019ll just rip\nyou off. Good place to window shop though.\nDo you know it\u2019s history?\nThe shop owner said he bought it off someone\nafter a gig in the 1970s. That\u2019s what he says\nanyway.\nJordan, I noticed you were only using one\nguys were all playing from sheet music. Are\nyou guys classically trained?\nJordan: Don\u2019t look at me.\nHow long have you been playing your instru-ments?\nJermyn: 11 years.\nMatt: Same for me. Half my life.\nGone\u2026\nMatt: Just gone\u2026\n\u2026behind the drums. Bashing away at the\npast.\nKeys?\nFaris: About 20 years I think. I only got into\njazz about 6 years ago though. Before that I\nwas just playing whatever, just by ear. I\u2019m\njealous of people who can actually sight read.\nI\u2019m not one of those people.\neffect pedal in rehearsal tonight. What\u2019s\nwrong? Are you okay?\nJordan: I\u2019m having withdrawal symptoms\nalready. That\u2019s what the ale\u2019s for.\nSo do you prefer to go light on the crazy stuff\nwith the jazz band?\nJordan: It\u2019s not really appropriate is it\u2026\nDo you ever go through episodes where the\nother guys let you do your thing?\nJordan: Not really\u2026\nSo do you feel repressed with this band?\nJordan: Haha na, it\u2019s just a bit of a change.\nJust walking bass lines.\nJordan and I were going to play at THROB\nbut we only jammed once.\nJordan: We could have gone for half an hour\nof feedback to be honest.\nWhen I came into your rehearsal tonight I\nnoticed something different right away: you Continued overleaf...\n...Continued from Page 26\nThe point of this column is to give you enough\nguidance so that you can go out into the big bad\nworld of post-hardcore and not end up naked, lying\nin filth and eating your own rancid faeces. That was\nmeant to be symbolic for listening to poor music by\nthe way. To set you up with a solid foundation, the\nfirst few episodes in this saga consist of the older\nbut integral champions of this genre and to add another sturdy block to this foundation, this week I\ngive you Glassjaw.\nThe majority of you will probably know the lead\nsinger Daryl Palumbo from pop group Head Automatica but I assure you, Glassjaw could not be\nmore different. Being from New York themselves,\ntheir style is heavily influenced by the early NY hardcore scene although Palumbo\u2019s signature vocal\nsound adds a great deal of likeability to this niche\nstyle. Their debut album Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence is held by their \u201cmost\nloyal\u201d fans to be their best but those not perched\ncomfortably on a hipster-high-horse recognise their\nsecond and most recent full-length release Worship\nAnd Tribute to be a work of mastery.\nAlong with these two full-length albums, Glassjaw\nhave also released four incredible EPs and various\ndemos. All of these releases have their share of\nsavage and softer tracks but the pure essence of\npost-hardcore is wired into every second. EYEWTKAS is mainly composed of heavy tracks but after\nthis release the band started showing a less aggressive side, with Palumbo starting to sing more\nthan just blare pig noises. Their music is hard to\ndescribe but I think the best way would be to say it\nhas palpable hardcore roots with a chilling edge\u2026\nsometimes. The experience can be likened to\nsomeone punching you in the teeth and then whispering in your ear to take your little pants off\u2026 or\nsomething less rapey. (Why does rape always come\nup in this column?)\nAnyway what I\u2019m trying to say is that the music\nis very good and has given the band it\u2019s rightful\nplace in post-hardcore history. Glassjaw have a new\nrelease in the works so keep your eye out for that\nand make sure you check out the Recommendations. Yeah, that\u2019s right there\u2019s two this week, suck\non that bitches!\nWriter\u2019s Recommendation\n1. For the fans of heavier stuff check out the song\n\u2018You Think You\u2019re (John Fucking Lennon)\u2019.\n2. For something a bit more reasonable, check out\nthe song \u2018All Good Junkies Go To Heaven\u2019 (check\nout the amazing rehearsal version on YouTube).\nGeorge Jeffery\u2019s\nA beginner\u2019s guide to\npost-hardcore\nLesson 3: Glassjaw\nMUSIC\nFELIX Friday 27 January 2012 27\n\n"

    "content": "On a small farm, nestled deep in Northern Utah,\nsomething extraordinary is happening: creatures\nare being bred that are part goat, part spider. Last\nweek\u2019s episode of the BBC\u2019s epic science series\nHorizon followed Adam Rutherford as he journeyed to meet these fascinating hybrids and their\ncreator to find out more.\nIn charge of the unusual herd is Randy Lewis,\na professor of genetics at Utah State University.\nThe farm is a university outpost where they research modern farming techniques, teach animal husbandry and raise the intriguing \u201cspidergoats\u201d.\nSince the first genetically engineered bacteria\nin 1973, we have been able to exploit the universality of the DNA code by cutting and pasting bits of DNA from one species into another.\nMore recently, this editing technology has progressed and expanded into the field known as\nsynthetic biology, and DNA code is effectively\ninterchangeable between all species.\nUsing synthetic biology techniques, Randy and\nhis team have taken the gene that encodes drag-line silk from an orb-weaver spider and spliced it\ninto DNA coding for milk production in the goat\nudders. This new genetic sequence was then inserted into an egg and implanted into a mother\ngoat.\nNow when their beloved spider-goats, Freckles, Pudding, Sweetie and the gang, lactate their\nmilk is full of spider-silk protein \u2013 they produce\n\u201csilk-milk\u201d.\nThe milk is then processed to extract the spider\nprotein and run around a spool to be collected.\nThis process is considered extremely exciting\nbecause naturally occurring spider silk is widely\nrecognised as the strongest, toughest fibre known\nto man. Its tensile strength is greater than steel yet\nit is 25 percent lighter than synthetic, petroleum-based polymers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re interested in dragline silk \u2013 the silk that\nspiders catch themselves with when they fall. It\u2019s\nstronger than Kevlar. It really has some amazing properties for any kind of a fibre,\u201d Randy\nexplained.\nIt could be argued that breeding spider-goats is\nmerely an extension of our 10,000 year old farming practices. All livestock and arable products\nhave been genetically selected. They are carefully bred to produce the most desirable characteristics with each cross being a genetic experiment\nof its own.\n\u201cThe trouble is, you can\u2019t farm spiders,\u201d Randy\nmused. \u201cThey\u2019re very cannibalistic.\u201d\nThe impressive and desirable properties of\nspider silk means Randy\u2019s apparently bizarre\nresearch is extensively funded. Studies have\nshown that the silk is not only incredibly strong\nby is also compatible with the human body. So\nLook out! Here comes a spider goat\nAn actual spider goat... Batteries not included\nWant to write for Felix Science?\nEmail us: science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nfar, no inflammation or negative reaction has\nbeen found when the silk has been inserted\ninto the body. It\u2019s already known that silk good\nenough to be used in ligament repair can be made\nand it is hoped that, within a couple of years, tests\nto determine the best designs and the best materials that can be produced, will be underway.\nThis could include creating strong, tough artificial tendons, ligaments and limbs; repairing other\ntissues; healing wounds; or creating super-thin,\nbiodegradable sutures for eye or neurosurgery.\nAs amazing as it is, this extraordinary piece\nof bioengineering isn\u2019t even on the cutting edge\nanymore. The fast moving field of Synthetic Biology now incorporates an extensive variety of\ngenetic exploration techniques; and personally, I\ncan\u2019t wait to see what they come up with next.\nHorizon: Playing God presented by Adam\nRutherford is available on BBC iPlayer\nIs there something more we can learn from the\nsounds emitted by bacteria and viruses? Even\nthough microbes cannot \u2018speak\u2019 in the way that\nanimals can, scientists believe that there is a lot\nto learn from the noises produced when small organisms move around.\nUntil now, these vibrations had always been\nthought too weak to be picked up by any conventional device. This is why optical physicist J.\nFeldmann and the Photonics and Optoelectronics\nGroup at the University of Munich recently developed the world\u2019s tiniest ear. The \u2018ear\u2019is a particle of gold, 60 nanometres in diameter, that by\nvibrating in response to passing waves can provide useful information about very faint sounds.\nThis method exploits some basics principles of\nphysics: when a wave passes through a medium,\nparticles in the medium respond by oscillating\nwith the same frequency of the wave. By studying the response of the gold particles to sound\nwaves, researchers are able to investigate the nature of the vibration.\nOne of the gold particles is immersed in water\nand held in place by a laser beam that serves as\n\u2018optical tweezers\u2019\u2013 a technique invented in 1986\nand widely used in modern molecular biology\nand genetics. Energetic pulses of light are then\nfired at similar particles trapped around it with\nthe same method. By heating up, they generate\na disturbance in the water, leading to a compres-sion-decompression process that generates a\nsound wave. Scientists are thus able to analyze\nthe movement of the first particle (the \u2018nano-ear\u2019)\nand gather information around the nature of the\nwave. By varying the frequency and the orientation of the light pulses, the scientists saw that\nthe particle would match the new frequency and\nalign its vibration with the new direction.\nDr. Ohlinger, one of the authors of the study,\nclaims that this nano-microphone \u201callows us\nto get closer than ever to microscopic objects.\u201d\nNever had it been possible to have such a great\nsensibility before, affirms co-author Dr. Lutich:\nresults showed that the nano-ear could pick up\nsounds down to about minus 60 decibels \u2013 an intensity one million times smaller than what the\nhuman ear is able to detect.\nThis technology could lead to a new and revolutionary way to study the microscopic world.\nAs well as helping us understand better the way\nmicroorganisms function, it could also be implemented in the study of cells affected by certain\ndiseases. For example, red blood cells vibrate\nless if infected with malaria than healthy ones.\nHowever, there are still some problems scientists will need to solve. One of the major issues\nappears to be the capacity to distinguish between\nsound waves and other type of vibrations such\nas the ones caused by random molecular move-ments. Biophysicist Dr. Oddershede of the Niels\nBohr Institute in Copenhagen, told the journal\nScience that the project still needs to go through\na long process of refinement before acoustic microscopy can become a reality. She is nevertheless quite optimistic about its future: \u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting idea, and [\u2026] this paper is very\ninspiring. I do believe they can relatively quickly\nimprove the equipment.\u201d\nDespite these initial difficulties, the researchers\nare convinced that we are on the right path not\nonly to see, but also to hear what the world of\nmicroorganisms has to tell us.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.018101\nMichele Tonutti\nA popcorn map, obviously\nFELIX\nFriday 27 january 2012\n8\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nNano-ear can hear microorganisms\nIn brief\nAncient popcorn found in Peru\nThey may not have had any decent bowls to eat it\nfrom, but new research suggests that, as long ago\nas around 4600 BC, ancient Peruvians were eating popcorn. A research group led by Tom Dillehay\nfrom Vanderbilt University, and Duccio Bonavia, from\nPeru\u2019s Academia Nacional de la Histori, have found\nSouth America\u2019s earliest ever examples of corn\n\u2018microfossils\u2019, at two mound sites, Paredones and\nHuaca Prieta, on the northern coast of Peru. These\nfossils, together with some of the oldest known corn\ncobs, husks, stalks, and tassels, discovered at the\nsite, indicate that the area\u2019s ancient inhabitants\nwere using corn in a variety of ways, from corn flour\nto popcorn \u2013 despite it not yet being an important\npart of their diet.\nWhat makes this story even more fascinating is\nthat, with this discovery putting popcorn on the Peruvian map around 2,000 years earlier than previously\nestimated, such use of corn now predates the first\nknown examples of ceramic pottery in the region.\nIn a paper recently published in the Proceedings of\nthe National Academy of Sciences, Dolores Piperno,\nof the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, explains how the domestication of corn, originating in\nMexico around 9,000 years ago, spread in only a few\nthousand years to South America, and thus \u201cin many\nareas corn arrived before pots did.\u201d She goes on to\nconclude about the ancient Peruvians that \u201cearly experimentation with corn as a food was not dependent on the presence of pottery\u201d.\nThe complex history of the hundreds of varieties of\ncorn now present is still largely unclear, especially for\nsuch early time periods, as any historical evidence of\ncorn cobs or kernels were hardly well preserved in\nthe humid tropical rainforests between Central and\nSouth America where the crop is thought to have\nbeen originally dispersed. The wealth of information\nprovided by this new data is therefore incredibly valuable in trying to get a glimpse of how and where corn\nbecame what it is today.\nArianna Sorba\nEmma Houghton-Brown\nPamela Belding \u2013 STRI\n\n"
