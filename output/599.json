    "content": "Natural History\nThe society organise regular lectures, trips and\nfilms. So far this term we have had Professor\nSmyth and Doctor Lamb give lectures on\nparasites from pets and wine-making. We\norganised an afternoon trip to Silwood Park\nfield station to introduce first year life scientists\nto the station and the work that is done there\nand two groups from the society went around\nthe British Museum (Natural History) during\nits open days. So far this term we have been on\nfour bird-watching rips. At Rickmansworth, we\nhad good views of si skins and red polls and at\nBarn Elms Reservoir we saw goldeneye and a kestrel at very close range. We have also been\nfurther afield; at Rainham in Essex we saw\nb ramblings and a hen harrier despite being\nunder fire from the local army ranges! At\nSheppey on the North Kent coast we saw\nanother hen harrier and a short-eared owl,\npurple sandpiper and flocks of wintering snow\nbuntings.\nComing up we have a lecture by Mr A. Seccombe on 'The Wildlife of the Seychelles'\nand an RS PB film accompanied by cider and\ncheese. Next term we have already organised\nlectures on Butterflies by Prof E. Laithwaite,\nPolution by Doctor D. Dolby, and Schistosomes by DrC. Wright.\nCommunity Action\nIf any one is interested in any of the following\ncome to the meetings, top of the Union, every\nMonday at 12:30: draught proofing old people's homes on Wednesday, December 9 in the\nafternoon; helping with the children of\nbattered wives, taking them to sights in\nLondon, etc.; helping with handicapped children on Saturday afternoons; soup rt in s on\nTuesday and Thursday, meet10:30 pm, Falmouth Kitchens; visiting patients in St\nPancras Hospital or taking them out on trips.\nNext Tuesday and Wednesday, November 8\nand 9, it's blood do ning.

Following a challenging\nroute from easy navigation. So tbe event is not\nonly a competition in its own right, but also an\nexcellent introduction to rallying.\nI can hear some of you saying \"But my\nLand Rover only ever does 17 miles to the\ngallon.\" Well, to make things fair, your result is\ncompared to accepted consumption figures for\nthe model.\nSo, if you fancy stripping off the roof-rack,\nwinding up the windows and trying not to lose\nany speed on the corners, why not enter.\nIf you have images of throwing around a fully\nprepared RS1800, but have never driven competitively, why not come along.\nDetails from the Motor Club noticeboard in\nMechanical Engineering.\nYou might even enjoy driving economically!\nL \u2014 . v.' \u00a7 Rugby\nSeconds\nOn Wednesday the Second XV travelled into\nthe sticks to play the Royal Vets College.\nWhen the referee eventually turned up the\ngame started with IC dominating.\nAggressive play by the forwards set up the\nball for the backs who, despite changes of\nposition, ran the ball well, ending in the left\nwinger R. Frith scoring two tries, and the\nright winger R. Flynn scoring one. Two of\nthem were converted by M. Winsor.\nThe vets capitalized on a lull in the\nenthusiasm in the second quarter and ran in\ntwo converted tries. These were probably due\nto players being confused by technical line-out calls like 'bovine mast it is'! After the interval IC regained their confidence and played most of the remaining\ngame in the opposition half and with good\nforward support the ball was moved along\nthe backs, leading to R. Frith scoring his\nthird try.\nFrom a well tuned penalty move W. Aston\ncrashed over the line to score and with M. Winsor converting this and a later penalty,\nImperial were the eventual winners by 29-12.\nTeam: M. Winsor, R. Frith, G. Pike, W. Chapman, R. Flynn, M. Thompson, J. Paixdo, S. Bell, C. Cole, J. Hutton, C. Henderson, T. Carr,\nD. McGee, W. Aston, M. Pearce.\nJudo\nWe arrived bright and early for the tournament which was an invitation tournament between teams from universities\nin Europe. The competition started at\n10:30am and we were drawn in a pool with\nDijon, Bochen and Eindhoven 2 (the home B team). We were at a slight disadvantage as\nwe only had a six man team so in any contest\nwe lost the first bout by default, also our team\nconsisted of two brown, two green and two\norange belts whereas all of the other teams\nwere mainly black belts.\nWe were drawn to light Bochen li rst and\nmade a valiant effort, winning two lights; the\nlosing members of the team put up incredibly\ngood opposition and their loss can be blamed\non lack ol competition experience.\nNext we (ought Dijon and in the tradition\nof French clubs they were very good, we-only\nmanaged one draw, this time some of the\nblame can be laid on bad ref cree ing as we got\ntwo bad decisions.\nIn the last light in out pool against one ol\nthe home learns wc managed one thaw and\nsullen-d greatly from la< k ol experience.\nThere ended the competition lor us so\nmissing the final 'wc were showering; which\nStrasbourg won. then retired to the Street of a.

    "content": "Dear Sir\nProfessor Hartley' s RCS Centenary lecture entitled'' RCS Leads Into Biotech no logy last Thursday illustrated a number of aspects of this\nexciting field in which several\ndepartments of the College are involved. The presence of an executive from the new British biotechnology company Cel tech was an indication of industry' s newfound and highly justified enthusiasm for the new technology.\nThe Imperial College prospectus clearly states that\nthe central function of our College is to serve industry. This should be accomplished by directly solving current problems or creating new areas of basic knowledge. Professor Hartley was careful\nto point out the growing links\nbetween industry and biologists. What he failed to mention was that he is currently negotiating the sale of one of the Colleges\" most valuable resources to industry( see last week's,\\ ew Scientist).\nThose in the field realise\nthat the possession by Imperial College of an excellent fermentation pilot plant gives\nus the ability to truly lead in biotechnology. The new companies also sec the need\nfor such a facility. It seems\nlikely that industrial money will shortly begin to Hood into\nthe toilers of the pilot plant irrespective of who owns it.\nThe disadvantages of indus trial ownership of the pilot\nplant are clear. The College effectively loses control. Basic\nresearch will undoubtedly suffer and researchers will inevitably be forced to the\nback of the queue, whilst there are undoubtedly some\nshort term advantage sol industrial ownership such as\ninvest men I capital and dynamic commercial management, the long term effects\nwill inevitably be damaging. The principle of selling profitable chunks of universities oil to industry is in itself\na dangerous one. ( liven the\nright sort of management Iam sure the Southside Halls could he an immensely profitable hotel! I sincerely hope the College authorities will seriously consider the lull implications before taking such ad ange rous step.\n] Ours\nNick Green Botany Dear Mark\nIs Mr Hicks trying to pull the wool over our eyes concerning the pricing of books in IC Bookshop? The Bookshop Manager staled in his letter to\nFELIX last week that \" The price of a book is sel by the\npublishers; by law, the Bookshop has to sell it at that\nprice.\" This is only true lor \"net\" books.\nIf a book has a price printed on it, or a price sticker\nplaced on it by the publisher, then il is referred to as a\" net\" and must be sold at the stated\nprice. A bookshop makes it\nprofit on\" net\"books by receiving a discount on the\nnet price from the publishers,\nwhich can be as high as 4 0 %\n(i.e up to 4 0 % of what you pay would go to the bookshop). However, there is also a class of book referred to as\n\" non net\". These usually have no price printed on them by the publisher, and if a book has a price it ril/ en\ninside the cover in pencil then\nit is more than likely a\"n on net\" book. In general, ' \" non net\" books tend lo be educational/ text books and therefore many textbooks required by IC students come under the\" non net\" cat a gory( particularly\" student editions\"). The discount received\nby bookshops from the publisher on the \" non net\" price\nis usually much lower than lor\n\" net\" books, and while I was\nworking lora firm of book\ncontracts ( who run a number of bookshops) this was tv pic all v12',%. The\" non net\" price is no l compulsory, and indeed is not\nusually charged. Because bookshops receive a smaller discount on\" non net\" books\nthey usually price these higher than the \" non net\" price. ( The firm I worked lor charged10% on top of\" non net\" price.) The additional charge, however, is up to the\nparticular bookshop concerned. Books that have to be bought by bookshops from\nforeign publishers( e.g. the\nUS) area tao classed as \" non net\" in this country, and bookshops sometimes add as\nmuch as 5 0 % into the price( alter conversion to sterling)\nin order to cover costs incurred by payments in foreign currency. I would be interested to\nlearn what Mr Hick's pricing policy is with regard to \" non ncl\" books, both form UK and foreign publishers.\n1 ours sincerely\nJulian Richardson Che mEn g4PS: Through becoming a member of\" McGraw Hill Chemical Engineers Book Club\" in the US,I have bought many engineering and othe r books at half the\nprice charged in IC Bookshop. Dear Mark\nIt was with some concern that we read SimonS haw's letter last week about the irresponsible games played with a lire extinguisher. This is not the first time an extinguisher has been unnecessarily discharged this term. We would like to remind your readers that these games\nare not fun \u2014 they are dangerous. A missing or empty lire\nextinguisher can obviously turn a controllable lire into a major disaster.\nFinally, it should be noted\nthat unnecessary discharge ol\na lire extinguisher is against\nthe law of the land and is\npunishable by a line of up to\n/ 1 . 0 0 0 .\nPlease, dear strides, act responsibly.\n1 ours\nThe IC Union Executive Dear Sir\nFrom the letters, comments and general attitude around College over the last couple of weeks, I get the impression\nthat a lot of people in this\nCollege have little or no idea\nwhat the\" God Squad\" believe. They seem content to\ncast us all into their own stereotype and then insult,\nderide and generally despise\nus ( and looking at the stereotype I'm not really surprised!).\nThe point is that most of us\ndon't lit into this mould; people seem genuinely sur-pri sed to see a Christian playing pinball. or having a drink in the bar. Now it may be that they are happy with a grossly inaccurate idea of a Christian, and if that's so,\nthen fair enough: but this is a College full of intelligent people, and someone must\nwant to know more, purely from the point ol view of fair-mindedness. If they do, I'd be\nhappy to have a chat some-time, and they can find me through the Me chEng letter-racks. I don't want to preach, I just want to explain. Yours openly\nL. Mercer\\1 E2 Dear Mr Smith\nI was shocked and disgusted\nto hear that for the past five\nyears I have been inadvertently consuming the flesh of our sacred animal, the cow, in Mr Mooney' s refectories.\nMr Mooney has not given any explanation or even an apology for this outrage. I don't believe he realises the\nseriousness of his blunder( if\nindeed it was a blunder). As a devout Hindu I have spent\nmy whole life following the\nteaching of our prophets in our holy books. Now I realise\nthat all my fasting, praying and strict observance has all gone to waste.\nThanks a lot Mr Mooney, you' ve really bugger ed up my chances of heaven! Yours disgustedly\nLar j alTa bug Dear Sir\nAmI the first person to pub lie ally reveal that Barney\nMcCabe is really an anagram for Crabby Menace!'\n} ours\nC.

Definitely a film redolent with not-to-be-missed ness. While on the subject of films, it has been\nbrought to my attention that Ents think I don't like them. Nothing could be further from the\ntruth. All my past statements about them were\ngenuine expressions of sympathy and gratitude for blok es with a hard job who so\noften are blamed when things go wrong and\nare not mentioned at all when things go right.

Depressing isn't it?\nCND\nWing Chun\nIn Chinese history Buddhism and Shaolin\ntemple are synonymous with Kung Fu. Wing\nChun Kung Fu has its roots here. A Buddhist\nnun, who after observing a fight between a white crane and snake devised a system of self-defence from the action of these animals. She\ntook into account the difference in physique\nbetween men and women when she created\nthe art, whose close range techniques have\nsimple yet fast and lethal moves.\nMaster Yip Man introduced the art to Hong\nKong after the Second World War. Througb\nhis students (such as Bruce Lee and Master\nLau) Wing Chun gradually spread across to\nthe western world. Master Lau is one of the\nleading exponents in Wing Chun.\nThe IC Wing Chun Club is a division of\nMaster Lau's Wing Chun Academy. To celebrate the birth of our club recently we\nhave arranged a social evening on December\n12, at 7:00pm, in the Union Building.\nThe programme includes a demonstration of\nWing Chun Kung Fu by Master Lau, food,\ndrinks, raffle, music and party games.\nIf you are interested, hurry and get your\nticket from Sandeep Jesndasen Civ Eng 3,\nEdgar Pilkington EE1, Benny Notarianni Phys\n3, Union Office.\nWing Chun classes are held on Wednesdays\nin the Union Gym between 3:00 and 6:00pm; and Saturdays in the Union Gym between\n11:00 and 2:00pm The meeting of Thursday, November 26, was\naddressed by Mike Terry, an active member of\nAnti Apartheid. Mike presented a highly\ninformative account on the history and prospects of nuclear proliferation in South\nAfrica.\nUnquestionable evidence was presented for\nthe existence of a South African bomb, along\nwith disturbing developments in battlefield\nnuclear shells and weapon delivery systems.\nMike laid the blame directly with the US and\nBritish policies to provide large amounts of\ntechnological assistance for so-called \"peaceful\ndevelopment of nuclear reactor facilities\".\nWork is now beginning on the production of\nleaflets and eventually a larger and more\ncomprehensive newspaper. However it is\nessential that people offer to help in the writing\nof these. If you would like to contribute in teh\nform of articles, cartoons, format, or whatever,\nplease send your ideas to C.J. Harries, Mech\nEng PG, so that we may consider them and tell\nyou if we think it's worth doing.\nAn ICC ND Bookshop is now set up in the\nJ CR every Monday lunchtime. Please go\nalong, and, more importantly encourage those\nwho remain undecided to pay it a visit.\nThe final meeting of term, on Thursday,\nDecember 10, will be addressed by Owen\nGreene, who many of you will know, has been\nworking with the \"London After The Bomb\"\nSANA group.

    "content": "Food For Thought\nThe sad state of IC's refectories\nThe eagerly awaited results of the ICU refectory survey have finally been published,\nand as expected, they say nothing that was not\nalready known. The main conclusion is\nthat IC catering is unacceptably bad. The report, submitted by Messrs Led wold and\nMorton, also contrives to avoid mentioning\nanything that could offend the powers on high,\ne.g. sacking Mooney and leasing the refectories to an independent company; steps\nthat would most rapidly improve the lot of the\nIC penniless gourmet.\nThe report was compiled from questionnaires distributed in the four main refectories\n(Sherfield, Union, Buttery and Southside) and\nin L instead. It was made over two days, Monday 26 and Thursday 29 October; Sample\nsizes (i.e. the number of forms filled in) range\nfrom the relatively small (100) to the pathetic\n(22). The questions covered the meal just\npurchased, refectory service in general,\nqueues, cook-freeze food, recycled food,\nbreakfast service, suggested improvements\nand increased services, bars, Hall and formal\ndinners, the Southside Shop and \"special\n.reaction noted from consumer\" (vomiting,\nrigor mortis?). No questions were asked concerning prices, hygiene and cleanliness, or\nthe \"foreign substances\" (e.g. staples, ground\nglass) frequently found in tbe food.\n' No results concerning bars, Hall and formal\ndinners, or the shop have been published, as\nmost people left these sections blank; therefore the compilers may assume that these\nservices are either satisfactory, ignored or the\nresults have not been processed.\nThe published survey includes results, a summary of the results, and conclusions drawn from the summary of the results. It is\nnot light bed-time reading and was quite a few\npages, so here is a\" summary of the conclusions drawn form the summary of the\nresults\"! All quotes are direct.\nThe Four Main Refectories\nGeneral result: About half the people questioned in each refectory were happy with\nthat particular meal. We are certain that a commercial venture would not accept such a low level of satisfaction.\nCook-freeze foods: \"...becoming coagulated\nor congealed too many times\" (as if once isn't enough). \" Most people asked don't like cook-freeze food, which is unfortunate if you get no\nchoice for your evening meal.\"\nRecycling:\" Many seem to feel they are\ngetting recycled food.\"\nCleanliness and Hygiene:\" In every refectory there were complaints about cleanliness and hygiene. Sometimes the point\nwas made quite strongly suggesting public\nhealth inspectors should be brought in.\" Staff: \" In every rec fec tory there were complaints about rude or unpleasant staff.\"\nBreakfast and Weekend services: \"Only 15\npeople admitted to using the breakfast service\noften 75 people (over 2 days) said they use\nthe weekend service often.\"\nPrices: \"Virtually everybody said the prices\nwere too high.\"\nSuggested increased services: \"It seems\nthat approximately half the people asked want\nan increase in sandwiches and rolls type cold\nfood. About a quarter want an increase in the\nrange of puddings and more fast food.\"\n\"there were well over 300 requests for more\nbar food.\" Other remarks: \"There were\" (was Marco)\n\" a huge number of unsolicited comments\nabout the high quality of the RCA and RCM refectories.\"\nEleven Conclusions\n1. The refectories simply must improve the all-round level of cleanliness.\n2. The staff could be a lot more pleasant. This\ncomment should not be taken personally by\nany member of the refectory staff. It is an\noverall problem of commitment to students.\nStudents are not the most tactful or diplomatic\nbreed and all we are asking for is a more\ntolerant approach from the staff. This might\ngenerate a better nature from the students and\nimprove the current relationships.\n3. More care is needed in the final stages of\nthe process of preparing food for students.\nThese are simple matters; a bit more care in\nmeal presentation, trying to keep \"hot\" food\nhot, and ensuring correct amounts are cooked\nto prevent continually reheating food for the\nnext session.\n4. Someone somewhere should learn how to\ncook chips and how not to wreck vegetables.\n5. The quality of the meat should improve\u2014it\nhas too much fat or gristle and is often said to\nbe undercooked. On this subject the fish is not\ntoo good either, often said to be \"soggy\".\n6. There are many specific complaints about\ntypes of food which could be easily rectified\n(e.g. solid baked beans, hard rice pudding,\netc.).\n7. Different organisation of queues might be\nconsidered in some refectories.\n8. There is a need for a salad bar selling good\nquality salads at reasonable prices, possibly \" a la RCA\" which got several mentions. This can\nbe combined with a demand for more sandwiches, rolls and other cold foods. There\nis also a demand for an increased range of hot\nfood and more variety every day. The question\n\"what type of food do our refectories cook\nbest?\" yielded no clear favourites, so maybe all\ntypes should be offered; casseroles, roasts,\nfries, grills, etc. We are formulating a hot\nfood/cold food plan.\n9. There is a demand for more food in the\nbars. This may fit in very well with the point\nabove.\n10. The demand for a breakfast service is\nminimal and the justification for this service\nmust now be questionable. The demand for a lunch-time service is massive and for an evening service substantial. The demand for\nthe weekend service is much smaller. Possibly\nthe survey captured the wrong people for\nestimating the need for weekend meals. Either\nway we believe the College has a social duty,\nas a community, to provide food at the\nweekends.\n11. The food in Linstead is totally un accept able. This situation must be seriously reviewed\nimmediately.\nThe situation in L instead Hall is that,\napparently as a condition of the presentation\nof the Hall to IC by an anonymous benefactor,\nall students must eat there at least three times\nper week. This costs them \u00a31.27 per meal.\nThe results from the Linstead survey were\nfrightening; on Monday 86% were \"unhappy\nwith the quality of the meal\". On Thursday, it\nwas 89%. To the question \"are you generally\nhappy with the service in the refectory?\" on\nMonday 67% were not, on Thursday only 39%\nwere not. On closer inspection, however, it\nwas seen that only 19 people were interviewed\non Thursday compared with 76 on Monday.\nThis highlights one of our criticisms of the\nsurvey; it was unrepresentative. Allowing for\nthe fact that a vast number of students never eat\nMooneys because they are so bad, to restrict\nthe survey to people eating in refectories was\nludicrous. In answer to this, Marco Ledwold\nclaimed that constructive criticism could only\nbe made by regular refectory users; how often,\nI wonder, do he and Nick Morton eat\nMooneys.\nA rough calculation reveals that, if only half\nof the people who eat in refectories find the\nservice satisfactory, this means that between\n80 and90% of ail students at IC would welcome improvements.\nThe other main criticism is the rather half\nhearted approach to the matter. Refectories\nhave been a standing joke now for years, and\nsuch remarks as (and I quote from \" The Plan\").\n\" A nice fresh sandwich with a cup of tea or a drink could prove a popular lunch in these\nhard times.\" are not going to cause a revolution. It is to be hoped that, having\nobtained these results, the Union acts on them; remember Nick Morton's promise at the\nfirst U GM of term?\nFully Guaranteed\nMEND-A BIKE\nMEND-A BIKE\n13-15 Park Walk, London SW10\n01-352-3999\nNew and Used Cycles\nSAME DA Y REPAIR SERVICE\nWe've got some great bicycle bargains!\nNew: 5-speeds British Eagle usually \u00a378 now \u00a370.\nClipper Luxus Sport usually \u00a379 now \u00a372.\nNew: 10-speeds British Eagle usually \u00a392 now \u00a380.\nLuxus Sport usually \u00a388 now \u00a378.\nPeugeot U01010 speeds alloy wheels, cotter less chain sets, etc., usually \u00a3145 now \u00a3124.\nFor the short distance cyclist second-hand small wheel cycles between \u00a320 and \u00a330.\nLimited number of ex-rental cycles \u00a349.00.\nTrade-ins accepted, also credit facilities available.\nPage 6 FELIX, December 4, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "Desert Rats\nNearly a year ago a group of\nkeen and ambitious physicists\ndecided to launch an expedition to what is probably the\nmost widely know desert\nregion, the Sahara.\nThe idea didn't materialise over\nnight; it arose, rather, as a natural\nprogression of events starting\nfrom a discussion about holiday\nplans during the long vac. \"Having\ndecided where to go, we then had\nto decide 'why'?, 'in what?' and\n'how do we finance it?'\" explained\nSimon Rodan.\nFrom this seemingly sham boli c starting point developed an\nexpedition covering 4,000 miles,\ntwo thousand in the Sahara itself,\nin two LW Bland rovers, over an\neight week period during August\nand September.\nIdeas for scientific studies were\ncollected and chewed over by the\nteam of six, and three projects\nwere chosen. These were outlined\nin a document, which also contained the proposed route, dates,\nmodes of transport and predicted\nexpenses, which was submitted to\nthe Exploration Board of Imperial\nCollege, which has a small annual\nbudget fro km which it can help\nfund such ventures. Malcolm Risbey, the expedition's treasurer\nrecalls those initial attempts at\ncosting:\" when we set about\ncalculating the cost of the trip we\nwere very unsure as to the\naccuracy of our predictions, but\nsurprisingly perhaps, if you take\ninto account the fact that we now\nhave two land rovers rather than\none as originally planned, we have\nkept remarkably closely to our\noriginal estimates.\" The team was\ninterviewed by the board, and\nsubsequently gained official recognition and a substantial degree of financial assistance.\nOf the immediate tasks, by far\nthe most pressing was to get\nsponsorship, primarily from British Industry. During February\nand March, the six members of\nthe team wrote, and produced a brochure briefly outlining the\nexpedition. These they sent with\naccompanying letters to more\nthan two hundred and fifty\ncompanies in the UK requesting\naid either in cash or in kind. The\nAlgerian Embassy had to be\ncontacted, and were most helpful'\neven if tied by too much red tape.\nAnother document was produced\nfor the Algerian Ministry of\nEducation, in French and English,\nfour copies each of this larg ish fifty\npage type script. \"In the end this\nwas all wasted time since we did\nnot get any response from the\nAlgerians until early November.\"\nBy June, quite a large amount of\nhelp had arrived despite, the poor\nstate of the economy, which meant a4% success rate in terms\nof useful replies to letters sent\ncompared to a predicted rate of\n10% or more, and none of this in\nthe form of direct (and much needed) financial aid.\nOn the scientific side, David\nHarris and Clive Standley spent\nmany weeks carefully constructing the delicate net flux radio-meters needed for the project and\ndevising the scientific procedure\nfor the experiments. The aim of\nthe primary project was to\ninvestigate the relationship between heat transfer to and from\nthe desert floor and high altitude\nwater vapour. As July 28, the\nscheduled departure date, drew\nnearer the final stages of preparation were completed, the most\ndetailed available maps studied,\nroutes finalised and an accurate\nitinerary drawn up. Dehydrated\nfood was bought and items of\nequipment such as sand ladders,\nmilitary spec gerri can s and frames.\nAll the team attended courses\non desert survival and first aid,\nwhile individual members went on .\nspecialised courses in land rover maintenance, expedition photo-graph y, and maintenance of the\ntwo chart recorders (which were\nthe most important individual\nitems in the experiment) at the\nmanufacturers, Chessell Ltd of\nWorthing, who had kindly donated\nthe recorders.\nEverything was going to plan\nuntil two weeks before the team\nwas due to leave, three of them\nlearned that they had failed an\nexam and they were advised by\nthe department to sit the retakes\non September2. The team returned to London, where they\nmet Brian Morgan, Director of\nUG Studies, and Keith Barnham,\nSenior Tutor, and subsequently\nBob Schroder and Don Adlington,\nChairman and Secretary resp ect iv ely of the Exploration Board. It was decided that the\nbest solution, if sponsorship commitments were not to be\nignored, and as the team were still\nkeen to go, was to postpone the\ntrip until the following year. Unfortunately since then two\nmembers have had second thoughts and have dropped out,\nleaving the team with four. \"We\nwould still like to take eight people\nthis summer, since we have got\nthe room and we could do with\nsome fresh ideas,\" said Andrew\nLayton, the team's resident mechanic.\nSo now the team must start\nonce again to get the show rolling,\nthough this year much of the work\nhas already been done. If anyone\nreading this article feels that they\nwould like to take on the challenge\nthat the expedition offers, there\nare four places to be filled before\nChristmas. Anyone interested\nshould get in touch with Simon\nRodan, Malcolm Risby, David Harris or Andrew Layton all of\nPhysics 2.\nFELIX DINNER\nFriday, December 11\nS CR Southside\n7:30 for 8:00pm Everybody welcome\n(the more the merrier)\nTickets \u00a37 from FELIX Office.

    "content": "rl d Md QE C IC Merger\nEven though the statement issued this week\nwas only a draft proposal to be put to both the\ngoverning bodies, it is quite obvious that as\nboth principals have accepted the draft it will\nundoubtedly be the basis for any merger. Thus\nthe students of this College must make their\nviews known.\nThe draft proposal would seem to suggest\nthat the bioscience s from Imperial College\nwould be combined with the food and nutrition,\ncourses at QE C to form a fourth Constituent\nCollege. I for one think that we should not kiss\nthe Life Sciences division goodbye as a sacrificial lamb to save QE C. The Royal College of Science of necessity must include\nthe Life Sciences and already has a strong\nreputation and tradition in this field. Establishing a fourth constituent college which\nwould not have any real status (initially) by\nchopping off a lump of RCS seems ludicrous,\nespecially as RCS already has the status.\nAn emergency U GM has been called for\nwhich will take place next Thursday. This is\nthe only way in which the Union can form\npolicy with the direct involvement of the\nstudents involved. It is up to you, the students,\nto turn up and make your feelings clear.\nIs y mpa this e with the plight of QE C, who\nhave been hit very hard by the cuts and must\nstruggle to survive. But in keeping their\nidentity, we must not lose ours.\nCome along to the Emergency U GM being called for next week and let your\nviews be known.\nBound Editions\nThose people who took the wise decision to\ninvest in a bound copy of last year's FELIX will\nbe delighted to know that they have arrived.\nThese can be collected from the office and\nreminders will be sent to those who ordered\nthem.\nThe Knocking Shop\nStill no response from the College about the\nawfully embarrassing refectory flat in the\nUnion Quad. However, I note a bill before\nParliament to legal is e brothels, so I suppose\nMr Mooney could take advantage of the\nsituation and open a profitable outlet in the\nUnion Building! We could w hell in Lampost Lil\nand Back land Brenda and have a really\nwonderful time and it would probably be\ncheaper than his horrible beefburger s. Douglas Bader\nI'm delighted to see that Douglas Bader and\nthe author of his official biography (Laddie\nLucas) will be signing copies of the said tome in\nthe IC Bookshop next Wednesday afternoon.\nSee Bookshop News (page 9) for details.\nThe Sound of Silence\nSurprise, surprise! Still not a word about the\nbeef pasties which Mooney has been selling as\nlamb for God knows how long. Surely this sort\nof mistake requires not only an apology but a public explanation. After all, there are several\ngroups in College who have been extremely\noffended by the whole affair. Mr Mooney, on\nthe other hand, is obviously not treating the\nmatter seriously.\nIf I have not received an explanation or\ndenial by Monday (to print next week) then I suppose I shall be free to pronounce that Mr Mooney is personally responsible, as he\nobviously, cares little for the thoughts (or\nstomachs) of the students at Imperial College.\nSo own up Vic\u2014were they lamb or not? If\nnot, why not? Or are you too scared to\nexplain.\nCredits\nMy thanks once again to Lesly, Peter, J. Martin, Martin, Paul, Christine and Adrian.\nA special thankyou to Patrick( guest\nwriter!) and all the wonderful colla tors( especially Izy).\nBlanche and Melanie were deep in thought\nover a chess game when Wodge entered the\nroom and wandered over to the board to\nwatch. Blanche, as usual, was white and after a few minutes thought, she played a move,\ngiving the position shown in the diagram. With\nmore than his customary politeness, Wodge\nwaited till the game was over before he started\nmaking comments.\nMelanie (Black)\np \u00a7 \u2022\n11 i IIP\nmH \u00b1\n1 \u00a7\u00a7 m1 Iff in\n\u00a7\u00a7 H Pill HH IP \u00a7\u00a7 \u2022 m1i \u00a7\u00a7j iii \u2022 EBB uH Blanche (White)\n\" Did you realise that from the position when\nI entered the room, Blanche could force mate\nin three moves?\" he enquired.\nMelanie looked suspicious. \"Does it use any\nof the funny, obscure rules of chess?\"\nWodge laughed, \"the only 'funny' rules, as\nyou call them, are castling and the en passant\nrule, and neither of them is particularly obscure or difficult; they' re just a little\nsurprising when you come across them unexpectedly in puzzles. But there's no en\npassant involved here.\"\n\"What about castling?\"\n\"I think you've had enough clues,\" grinned\nWodge. \"Let's see you find this mate in three.\"\nWhat was the position when Wodge entered\nthe room? What move did Blanche play? What\nshould she have played? And how did Wodge\ndeduce that this leads to mate in three? 'Mate\nin three', of course, means that White plays a move, then Black, then White, then Black, and\nthen White mates.\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office, please. A prize of \u00a35 (donated\nby Mend-a Bike) and two tickets to the IC\nChoir concert will go to the correct solution\ndrawn at 1:00pm on Wednesday.\nLast Week's Solution\nThere are two solutions (without counting rota\nt ions and reflections) and the diagram shows\nthe less obvious one. Tracy Carter, Civ Eng 1,\ncan collect her prize on Monday afternoon.\nHonourable mention for Antony Broadbent,\nPhysics 2, who was the only one to find both\nsolutions.\nSportsmanship\nWhen I 've set easy puzzles in the past, it has\nbeen obvious that one or two people have\nsubmitted duplicate entries, either under their\nown names (!) or names of collaborators. Now while I grudgingly admit that there's nothing to\nstop solvers showing their friends the solution,\nI'm a little annoyed when such unfair practices\nreach the point they did this week, with several\nsets of duplicate entries, and even reports of\none mercenary (whom 1 won't name) selling\nthe solution in return for an extortionate 75%\nshare of the winnings.\nSo to protect the interests of those who\nsolve and enter legitimately, any of you who\nare discovered perpetrating unsportsmanlike\nschemes in future will find yourselves blacklisted, and all your entries will go straight\nin the bin. I realise, of course, that such\nmeasures cannot prevent malpractice, but it\nwill at least force you to disguise your handwriting on duplicate entries.\nChristmas Competition\nInspired by Mr Humphries' superb letter on\npage 2, I'm offering a litre of wine and a large\nChristmas pu d for the best anagram of any\nCollege personality, building, institution,\ndomestic secretary, etc., etc. Closing date is\nMonday week, 1:00pm, and 'best' means 'most\nappropriate, witty, succinct, etc' Other News\nThanks to the choir for the extra prize this\nweek. The tickets will be in the winner's pigeonhole by Wednesday evening.\nThanks too, to Grey Spider for this week's puzzle. After a run of easy ones, this one is\ngood and difficult!\nFinally, I forgot to tell you that the text I encoded in the 'triangle' puzzle four weeks ago\nis the first page of Kit Williams' 'Masquerade'.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince\nConsort Road, London SW7 2BB(5895111 ext 1048 int 2881) Copyright FELIX 1981.

    "content": "Letters\nDear Mark and Readers\nI was prompted to write to\nyou by a pompous ill informed piece of drivel which wasted\n1 ' / j column of last week's letters page. (So you're following\nsui l Ed.)\nI have until now had sufficient sell control to not indulge in petty bickering over foolish allegations made against me, but I finally feel\nthat I must say something in my defence.\nWilliam D uro die is very\nexcited about certain' undertakings' that I gave to the police whilst I was Rag Chairman. These' undertakings' are the standard conditions under which collecting licences are issued\nto any organisation. They are\nstated quite clearly on the official licence certificates and documentation which we receive from the police. Given that there is nothing extraordinary about the conditions of our being granted licences\none can only presume that\nWilliam cannot read, even so\nhe could ask me.I am quite capable of normal communication, but perhaps he couldn't be bothered to leave\nhis throne and descend to my level, alternatively his lack of communication could indicate an overwhelming capability to do the job. William goes on to make three points concerning the June deadline for audited accounts, two of which concern me. He is most perceptive in noticing that College examinations occur at about the sametime as our collection accounts must be submitted ot' the police. Unfortunately it\nis not in my power to modify either date, but a little commonsense shows that circumstances are no different\nfrom previous years.\nThe reason why we could not obtain any collecting licences until January last year are surprisingly identical to the problems this year in that the police will not issue a new licence until the accounts from the previous year have been audited and submitted to them. William again complains that I failed to tell\nhim all this but the information is at his disposal in the Rag Office.\nHe goes on to allege that\nreminders for the accounts were sent to me. I have never received them, perhaps he saw lit to throw them away because they didn't mention him? The workings of his spiteful subconscious mind show through when he imagines that I would attempt to\nundermine Rag just to spite\nthe little toad.\nWhen I took on the job of Rag Chairman and whilst occupied in that position it\nwas no l for the sake of power, but because I wished to help\nother people by raising money lor them. If this motive had guided everyone involved with I CRag last year Iam certain that it would have be-en more successful, noone was more disappointed than I al the continuous bickering, in lighting and lack of cooperation experienced throughout the year.\nIts a fairly irrelevant point, but I did not actually handover lo William, but left Rag in the capable hands of Alan Edwards and the three CC UV Ps when I resigned. I made it quite clear to Alan that if there was anything I could possibly do to help then I was\nmost willing to do so, this\nmust surely be sell-evident\nanyhow unless anyone thinks that I harbour such spite as\nWilliam D uro die. It gives meno pleasure to\nsee Rag in trouble because of William, but he cannot try and shift the blame on to\nothers, he is the Chairman and that's where the buck stops.\nMyl in al regrets are the detrimental effects that this\nsordid al fair will have on I CRag's relationship with the Police and also the effects on our charities.

PS Keep up the good work(outs), Steve!\nThree years on the air!\nBack in the dim and distant past of December 1978, IC Radio started\nbroadcasting on medium wave (301m,999 kHz), becoming the first and\nonly inner-city student radio station in the country. Not to be\novershadowed by any other anniversary celebrations, they're celebrating\nthe third anniversary of this stupendous event by having a party with free\nbirthday cake. It's going to take place in Southside Bar this Monday\nevening (the 7th), between 7:00 and 10:00pm. Throughout the evening,\nprogrammes will be broadcast from the bar, and there will be\ncompetitions, one of the prizes for which is a really tasteful Christmas\nalbum by the Yobs.\nAmong the ol her programmes to listen out for 'on IC Radio is\n'Viewpoint', tonight and every Friday at 8:00pm, which provides an hour\nof news and views from the past week; theatre, cinema and gig guides\nand reviews; and what's on around College. As well as listening to it, you\nmay be interested in contributing to the programme, whether you're in IC\nRadio or not; if so, contact Steve Hartwell at the station (int 3440).\nFeatures that you may be interested in covering could include: the pros\nand eons of NUS, or the residence situation and what is behind the\npossible rent rises.\nSo don't forget: for free birthday cake\u2014Southside Bar on Monday\nevening be there (or be somewhere else).\nPage 4 FELIX, December 4, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nQEC Merger\nA fourth CCU?\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday, the joint working party\nset up to examine closer collaboration between Imperial\nCollege and Queen Elizabeth College recommended that the\ncolleges should form an \"association with the intent of a merger at a later date\".\nThe working party was set up about one month ago and has met\nregularly during November. The proposals are presented in the form of\na draft for discussion within the colleges. No decision will be taken until\nfull consultations have taken place.\nThe main theme of the proposal is that QE C should be incorporated\ninto IC as a fourth constituent college. The bioscience part of QE C is\nproposed to be physically moved to the IC site, which would require a new building (probably on the site next to new Chemistry). The\nphysical sciences at QE C would be \"accommodated elsewhere within\nthe university\".\nJoint planning and consultative committees are to be set up to\nachieve a closer working relationship prior to the eventual merger. The\ntimescale of the proposal is approximately five years, but major\ndevelopments might be expected before that time.\nThe proposal is in response to the problems of finance and student\nnumbers facing London University. It is not clear however just what\nfinancial savings will be made, and no mention is made of this in the\nstatement. Student numbers would presumably fall, although the new\n'super IC would be larger than it is now.\nA petition calling lor an Emergency U GM to discuss the matter was\nreceived in the Union Office yesterday. The External Affairs Committee\nis meeting at 5:45pm on Tuesday, December 8 in the Union Office to draft,,\na motion to the emergency U GM Rag Mag Reprieve\nICU's Rag Mag is once again\navailable after last Tuesday's LJ GM decided to overturn a previous decision banning it.\nThe meeting opened shortly\nafter 1:00pm with about 400\npeople in the Great Hall. Mr N 'ick Morton, ICU President, talked at length during his\nreport about the proposed merger with QE C, and how he\nhad managed to appease College.\nMr Barney McCabe, Deputy\nPresident, in his jovial manner,\ntook his trousers down, and then\nexplained his enjoyment equation. This was greeted with applause, proving that he can be\nquite witty in flashes.\nThe Hon Sec, Mr Marco Led wold, had his report ac-c ep ted. The motion on Princess Anne,\nconcerning her attendance at a mauling of a buffalo by a tiger,\nwas passed.\nThe motion on the Rag Mag was considered next. Because of aUG M decision last session restricting discussion of any matter to once a term, the\nmotion contained clauses over-coming this di If i cult)'. Alter much procedural wrangling s and\na futile attempt to force a paper\nballot, it was finally decided to\npermit the Rag Mag's publication to students only. Mr Patrick\nColl, Rag Mag Editor, told FELIX later that he was happy\nwith the decision.\nCollege to take blacks without A levels College\nreacts to\nScarman\nReport\nDaily Mail, Monday.\nImperial College has taken up the call by Lord Scarman for\npositive discrimination in favour of Britain's under privileged\nethnic minorities.\nIn an article in Monday's Daily Mail Lord Flowers said that he\nexpected about six special students a year to be taken on for degree\ncourses, starting next October. These will be people who are unable,\nthrough no fault of their own or lack of ability, to qualify for a place at\nImperial. \" They might have some mediocre A Level passes or they\nmight not have any A Levels at all. We have carefully not talked about\ncolour, but clearly it is a scheme to benefit black students from places\nlike Notting Hill and Brixton. We are going some way towards\ncorrecting the lack of privilege some students have had in the past,\" he\nsaid.\nAlthough the College has been thinking for some time of ways to\nhelp people who normally would be unlikely to get in, the Scarman\nReport has obviously precipitated developments to get the College to\n\"do their bit\". Lord Flowers said that he hoped the move would encourage other\nuniversities to carry out similar schemes for deprived children.\nCollege Secretary John Smith said \" But we're not looking for token\nblacks or anything like that. We don't need them. We want to try and\ntake up what Lord Scarman said and try to do something positive\nabout it.\" No. 599 Friday, December\n\n"

    "content": "Jam packed for Hartley\nNew chair in Biotechnology\nThe final Centenary lecture was given by Professor B.S. Hartley IRS of the Biochemistry department at Imperial College. His lecture was\nentitled ' RCS Leads into Biotechnology'. He firstly explained the\ntechniques involved in producing commercially important materials\nby bacteriological fermentation.\nOne has initially to isolate the gene coding for the material one\nwishes to manufacture. This can be done by a variety of classical\nmapping techniques. Then it is necessary to excise the gene from the\ngenome, this is done by specific enzymes termed restriction end on uc leases. It is possible to then isolate the gene by hybridization to\na radioactive messenger RNA. Once isolated the fragment has to be\ninserted in a cloning vector. The cloning vector is usually a plasmid (a circle of DNA found in bacteria) that is treated with the same\nrestriction end on ucl ease that was used on the donor genome. The ends\nof the gene will then adhere to the ends of the plasmid and a hybrid\nDNA structure will be formed. The plasmid usually has a antibiotic\nresistant gene so that when the plasmid is inserted in the bacteria the\nculture can be cleared of those without plasmids. The bacteria will\nthen multiply and generate the desired meta boli te. Professor Hartley then went on to describe the way a vaccine was\ndeveloped for hepatitis B virus using this technology in 18 months. He then discussed the much more complex problem of cloning human\ninterferon (one of several that were later discovered) which mainly\ncentred on developing high producing strains. Professor Hartley\nrevealed that the biochemistry department had played the key role of\nsolving the problem of large scale fermentation of interferon producing\nbacteria. He then outlined key areas where the application of this\ntechnology would have a revolutionary effect. They ranged from\npreventive medicine, genetic advice and plant pathology in the short\nterm to the long term of genetic surgery.\nHe also discussed his present investigation of the possibility of using\nbacteria to digest her mi cellulose s to produce ethanol. Professor Levy\nand Dr Palmer in the biology department, he said, were looking at the\ndeg red ation of lignin( a principle polymer in wood) in order to provide\ncommercially important phenolic compounds. He also listed a number\nof biochemicals such as the antibiotic pseudo mon ii acid that had been\ndeveloped at Imperial College.\nProfessor Hartley then looked into the future. He argued persuasively that there were many opportunities open for\nbiotechnology. He revealed that at a AUT meeting a motion had been\npassed stating that biotechnology at IC should not expand if that\nmeant redundancies in other areas. He said he could understand this\nLudditism, but was saddened by it. However, he said that he would do\nhis very best to attract money from private industry to support his\nresearch team. He then unveiled his plan to establish work in\nbiotechnology rt Imperial College. He wanted to see close cola b oration between the chemistry, biology and chemical engineering departments\nto establish a linn base. He also revealed that the Leverhulme\nfoundation would be funding a chair in biotechnology at Imperial\nCollege. In conclusion he said that though RCS was not leading at the\nmoment, he would do his very best to ensure that it would in the\nfuture.\nThere then followed a series of questions. They were initiated by\nMr Gerard Fairbrough, Cheif Executive of Celltech, Britain's first\ncommercial biotechnology company, who had introduced the lecture.\nAt then end of the lecture Professor Hartley was thanked by his\nfriend and collaborator Professor Blow, Dean of the Royal College of\nScience.\nEcology\nparty at IC\nWeinberg\nforces fill\nPhysics\nApproximately300 people packed Physics Lecture Theatre\n1 on Tuesday to hear Steven\nWeinberg, Professor of Physics at\nHarvard and- Nobel Laureate\n(1979) give a lecture on prospects\nfor further unification in the\ntheory of elementary particles.\nImperial College's Professor\nAbdus Salam( who won his\nNobel Prize jointly with We in berg) was in the chair.\nThe talk was of a highly theoretical nature; two of the\nmain problems being accelerating particles to energies of\naround 101 9\nGeV and observing\nevents which only happen once\nvery1032 years in an atom. Currently the former is impossible, while attempts are being\nmade to study the latter in several locations in America, by\nobserving thousands of tonnes of\nwater.\nThe most disappointing aspect\nof the event was that the venue\nwas too small, and it had been\npoorly advertised. With a little\nmore effort, even the Great Hall could have been filled.\nHeinz spills\nthe beans!\nOn Monday Wellsoc presented a talk by Heinz Wolll'e, best known\nto the public for his appearances\nin the BBC's' Young Scientist'\nand 'Great Egg Race' series. The\nlecture was entitled \"Fools for\nLiving', and concerned the work\ndone by Mr Wolff e and his\ncolleagues at the Clinical Re search Centre at Harrow, and\nothers, in producing devices to\nenable the elderly and the\ndisabled to live fuller and more\nindependent lives. Mr Wolff e considers that the increasing spending power of the elderly,\ncoupled with their higher expectations of living standards, will\nhave as large an impact on\ncommerce as that ol teenagers in\nthe 1950s and 60s. This development will involve job creation\nand will also increase the\nresources devoted to the needs of\nthe young disabled.\nNext week, Wellsoc present a talk by Jim Francis, who is a member ol the BBC Special Effects department and has\nworked on programmes such as\n'Blakes Seven' and ' Dr Who'.

General Secretary of\nthe Ecology Party, in which the\nparty's philosophy and policies\nwere outlined.\nMr F.lk in s stressed that his\nparty did not believe, as did the\nl our main British parties, that\nimprovement in the quality of life\ncould be achieved by continuously increasing production and\nconsumption. His party's policies\nwere based on production with\nthe minimum ecological dis -rup tion and the maximum conservation, as well as the\nmaintenance of a sustainable population. Overall the party-advocated decentralization, increased self-sufficiency and a more genuinely democratic, small-scale society; in particular\nthey proposed greater incentives\nlor the employment of people\n'the most underused resource'.\nNext week, the Environmental\nSociety will present a talk by a geologist on the disposal of\nradioactive waste (1800, Monday47 Prince's Gardens); a full programme of talks and lectures\nis planned for the year.\nCheers for\nQueen Mum\nPrince Charles paid a visit to the\nRoyal College of Music last\n\u2022 Thursday afternoon, accompanied by the Queen Mother, to\nreceive an honour ary fellowship\nof the RCM.

    "content": "Human Rights Week\nThe IC Union Human Rights Week commences on Monday, and coincides with a slightly more auspicious week of events\norganised by the United Nations. The aim at\nIC is to provide students with information\nabout violations of human rights in many parts\nof the world. More importantly, the dynamic\nclubs and societies running the events will be\nillustrating what students here can do to\ncounter such grave abuses.\nNaturally, eu ents will be held at lunchtimes\nand during the evening. Each participating\nsociety will be organising their own events,\nranging from a film show to a picket of the\nRector's pad. Unfortunately, Ihe idea of\nhaving a Human Rights Week was suggested\nonly recently, meaning that the it i nery of\nevents is not yet definite. However, at the time\nof writing, here are the details, society by\nsociety.\nSocialist Society\nSoc Soc is concerned about the exploitation of\nThird World workers; a particular example of\nthis is coffee pickers, people often receiving\nless than \u00a345 per year. It's obvious that\nmiddlemen make vast profits; mentioning no\nnames, but Nestles has a higher turnover than\nthe earnings of the vast majority of African\nnations.\nThere is an alternative! Campaign Coffee, a non-profit-making body supplies coffee from\nTanzania. When you buy it, a large part- of\nyour money goes to the workers who picked\nthe beans for you and so rightly deserve it.\nSoc Soc, believing in a fairer deal for the\nThird World, is selling Campaign Coffee every\nlunchtime in the J CR during H.R. Week. Free\nsamples might even be given, just to prove the\ninferiority of Mr Mooney's produce. So, come\nalong and start stirring for a better world.\nAdditionally, the society is having a speaker\nfrom the Society for the Protection of the\nUnborn Child, Tuesday at 6:30pm in the\nGreen Committee Room. Naturally, the issue\nof whether a woman's right to abortion or the\nfundamental right of human life should have\nthe priority will be discussed.\nWest London Chaplaincy\nS. America is one of the world's most\ninhumane continents. Poverty, hunger and\nmilitary dictatorships make the lives of the\npeople there almost as bad as those of IC\nstudents. The West London Chaplaincy is\nhosting an authoritative speaker, recently\nreturned from Peru, on this issue. The talk is\non Thursday lunchtime.\nConservative Society\nConservative Society will be holding a display\nin the J CR on Thursday on human rights\nviolations in the USSR. Labour Club\nLabour Club will be holding a display in the\nJ CR on Thursday on human rights violations\nin Chile.\nPositive Alternatives to Abortion\nSociety\nPAT A's display in the J CR on Thursday will be\ndealing with the human rights aspect of the\nabortion debate. Particular emphasis will be\nplaced on the unborn child's rights as d fe fined in the United Nations Declaration on the\nRights of the Child, the European Convention\nof Human Rights and the decision of the West\nGerman supreme court which decided that\nunborn children in Germany were protected\nby the constitution.\nJewish Soc\nWhen leaning on bars can be a little\ndifferent\nImagine the National Front has gained power\nin Britain. Now assume that you, upset by\nthis development, wanted to leave the country\nbut they won't allow it. Legally you can go but\nin practise... tough. 400,000 people have\napplied, but only 400 people, this year, were\ngranted the permits now required to leave the\ncountry.\nDoes all this sound rather unlikely? Well, if\nyou replace Britain with Russia and the\nNational Front by the Communist Party, we\nare describing a situation that exists today. If\nyou wish to know more about how you can be\nthrown out of university when all you want to\ndo is leave Russia and if you want to know\nwhat you can do to help, visit our stall in the\nJ CR next Thursday. It won't take you long,\nbusy as you are in the hectic eleven week\nterms of Imperial. In Russia the terms are\nsomewhat longer.\nUN Soc There will definitely be a stall on Thursday in\nthe J CR describing the work of this new\nsociety. At least one speaker meeting during\nthe week is being held.\nIslamic Society\nWe will be holding a books tall and have a speaker on Wednesday, December 9, in the\nafternoon.\nAmnesty International Group The Al Group will be adding a different aspect\nto Human Rights Week. We're holding an\nhour-long film show, screening The Hand and\nParadise Lost. 'The Hand', a short, animated\nfilm, depicts the oppression of the individual\nbehind the Iron Curtain, whilst 'Paradise Lost'\nfocuses on Paraguay, a country ruled by\na military dictator for the past seventeen years.\nVenue and time to be announced.\nWe also intend to have a speaker from our\nBritish section, explaining Amnesty International's work. John Cleese, Peter Cook and\nKate Bush won't be here, but someone more\nknowledgable will. Definitely an evening event.\nAt the Al stall in the J CR, you will be able to\nplay in the 'Dictator's World Cup'( adapted\nfrom the book Junta United). In addition,\nChristmas cards will be on sale, and we'll be on\nhand to explain the work we're doing on behalf\nof Firmin Awadon. Firmin was a student, just\nlike you; unfortunately, the military dictator in\nBenin Oust west of Nigeria) won't tolerate\ndiscussion of his policies, and has had Firmin\nimprisoned for two years now without trial.\nNeedless to say, the prison conditions are\ndisgusting. Come to our stall, and find out\nhow you can help set the world to rights.\nAnti-Apartheid Group\nThe Anti-Apartheid Group is definitely holding\na picket outside the Rector's pad next Friday\nat 11:00am. This is to protest against College\npolicy on South African government sponsored students on the nuclear technology\ncourse here. The group believes that such\nstudents will, on their return to South Africa,\nactively assist in the production of nuclear\nweapons.\nOn a cultural level, the group is offering\nstudents here an opportunity to appreciate\nnative South African art. There will be an\nexhibition of paintings by children on level two\nof the Sherfield Building.\nBaha'i Society\nSince the beginning of the Iranian revolution,\nthe Baha'is of the world have gr evi ou sly borne\nthe news of the persecution of their fellow\nbelievers in that country. The largest religious\nminority in Iran, the Baha'i faith has been\nexcluded from the new constitution.\nOn a large scale, holy places have been\ndestroyed, many Baha'is executed, and private\nproperty looted and burned. Life savings have\nbeen confiscated, and the entire Baha'i community is subjected to many forms of\ndiscrimination, humiliation, and violence.\nThe Baha'i faith is a world religion with its\nown scriptures, laws and calendar. It\nrepresents across section of humanity, including almost every nationality and trade.\nThe central teachings are the oneness of God, religion and mankind. The terrible persecution\nnow being witnessed in Iran stems from an\nintolerant attitude on the part of the authorities there. The Baha'i Society will be\nholding a speaker meeting on the subject of\nBaha'is in Iran next Thursday at 1:00pm, in\nLecture Theatre 213, Huxley Building.\nCatholic Society\nCatholic Society is using the theme of equality\nfor Human Rights Week, believing that nobody\nshould be discriminated against as a result of\ntheir race, creed or culture. To this end, the\nsociety is holding a stall next Thursday in the\nJ CR. Catholic Society is helping to give people in\nTanzania the right to food. Unfortunately, our\nsponsored walk to raise funds for a fish\nfarming project is not being held next week,\nbut in early March. However, the stall should\nhave more information about this.\nPage 8\nFELIX, December 4, 1981\n\n"
