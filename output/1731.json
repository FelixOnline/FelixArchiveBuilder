    "content": "It quickly moves from\nan economic question to a\nphilosophical one to argue\nwhether the idea of private\nproperty rights is a just\none or not. If the capitalist\nowns the private property\nin accordance with the\nlaw, why wouldn\u2019t it be\njust for those rights to be\nenforced?\nIf you were to ask a capitalist where they got their\nprivate property from,\nthey\u2019d say that they either\ninherited it or bought it\nfrom someone else. In\nthis sense, their right to\nown the private property\ncomes from what used to\nbe somebody else\u2019s right,\nwhich then transferred\nto them legally through\ninheritance or trade.\nThus, the legitimisation\nof private property rights\nrest on the legitimisation\nof those who used to own\nthe property before them.\nIf you were to examine\nhow the previous owners\ncame to own the property,\nthey\u2019d also say that it was\npassed on to them through\ninheritance or trade. Trace\nthis line long enough,\nPOLITICS\nISSUE 1731\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n10\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIn Mumbai, new high rises shadow the slums // Getty Images\nFELIX\nand you will end up at a\npoint where the rights to\nthe property were won\nthrough violence, such as\nthrough war and conquest.\nAnd even prior to this\nphase of property being\nowned by those with the\nmightiest armies, the very\nconception of private\nthere was no private\nproperty. All land was\nheld in common, used\nby all through a natural\nprinciple of free access. In\nthe UK, it was only until\nthe process of enclosure,\nwhere the common land\nwas siphoned off and\nentitled to aristocrats and\nlandlords through legal\nacts passed by the Crown,\nthat this land ceased to be\navailable to the commons.\nIn this way private\nproperty rights are dependent on the state both\nhistorically in terms of\nenclosure, and in modern\ntimes through legislation\nand the continuation of\nthe threat of state violence\nin order to enforce them.\nOne widely used definition of the state is: a\ncentralised organisation\nthat wields a monopoly\non the use of violence\nwithin certain borders. If\nyou own private property,\nthe state is there to use\nits institutions such as\nthe police and military\nto enforce those property\nrights.\nThis is how modern\nprivate property rights can\nbe traced all the way back\nto medieval times, with\nlegitimacy of these rights\nresting on the perceived\nlegitimacy of enclosure\nand conquest. If we\nbelieve that the monarchy\nis an unjust system, and\nthat it is not legitimate to\ntake something by violent\nforce (a.k.a. theft), then\nto generate profits off\nthe workers\u2019 labour.\nAll property would be\nowned either personally,\nfor one\u2019s own personal\nuse, or collectively, with\ntheir fellow workers,\ntenants, or the commu-nity. Capitalism rests on\nthe class system, which\nin turn rests upon the\nenforcement of private\nproperty rights, which\nin turn rests on the state.\nTherefore, the existence\nof a state is a requirement for capitalism.\nWithout private property\nrights, the class system\nwould collapse and\nso would capitalism,\nushering in an economic\nsystem where the means\nof production are held\nsocially under collective\nownership: this alternative system is referred to\nas socialism.\nThat is the fundamental difference underlying\nthe two opposing\neconomic systems: who\nowns and controls the\nmeans of production? Is\nit an elite minority, or\nis it everyone? Markets\nalso play an important\nrole in capitalism, and\nthe perceived effectiveness of distribution of a\nmarket-based economy is\nwhy many would consider\ncapitalism to be the most\nsuccessful economic\nsystem that we could ever\nhave, despite the authoritarian underpinnings of\nsuch a system.\nMarkets will be\ncovered in a future instalment of this series, but\nnext week we will have a\nlook at the state. We have\nalready introduced the\nidea of a state and briefly\ndiscussed its role in enforcing private property\nrights; however, there\nis a lot more to discuss\nregarding how it is used\nto prop up capitalism both\ndomestically and globally.\nMake sure to grab a copy\nof Felix next Friday for\nPart 3!\n-\u201cTherefore,\nthe existence\nof a state is a\nrequirement\nfor capitalism\u201d\nthat results in the collapse\nof the moral argument for\nprivate property.\nIf private property were\nno longer a thing, then\nthe capitalist class could\nno longer restrict access\nand control of the means\nof production, and thus\ncould no longer operate\nthe wage labour system\nproperty had to first come\ninto existence: go back far\nenough and there were no\nstates, no police, and no\narmies to enforce private\nproperty rights, and thus\n\u201cTherein\nlies the cost\nof private\nproperty\nrights: the\nrequirement of\nstatist violence\nto enforce\nthem\u201d\n\n"

They have\nand will continue to invest\na fortune into their new\ncampus.\nThe sale of St. Mary\u2019s,\naccompanied by promises\nof expanded facilities,\nsuch as a medic\u2019s gym,\nlikely at Charing Cross,\nare further evidence of\nthe College\u2019s drive to\ncentralise the medical\nschool\u2019s various disparate\nfacilities.\nThe result of this\ninitiative is written on the\nwall. Imperial is on its\nway to becoming a ful-ly-fledged multi-campus\nuniversity.\nThis is not a clearly\nstated directive yet. It\u2019s\nmerely implied. However,\nthe transient nature of the\nstudent population and the\nglacial pace of progress,\nmake spotting changes in\nthe running of the college\nvery difficult. Without\nany sort of institutional\nmemory, students even\nonly a couple of years\napart can have wildly different experiences, with\nboth of them believing\nthat their experience was\nthe \u2018norm\u2019. The shift,\nhowever, is occurring and\nI think very few of us have\ntruly mulled over what it\nmeans.\nI think a lot of us will\nhave mixed feelings about\nthis. Word around the\nFelix office is that this\nsucks.\nSure, there are numerous tangible benefits \u2013 the\nability to cheaply expand\nlaboratory and student\nspaces to provide better\nfacilities for world-class\nresearch and teaching\nis not to be sniffed at.\nTo remain a world-class\ninstitution, Imperial must\nmove in this direction.\nSouth Kensington simply\ncannot accommodate the\nuniversity\u2019s ambitions \u2013\nthere is no more space on\ncampus, and continuously\noptimising the existing\nspace can only take the\nCollege so far. Nearby\nproperty comes at a\npremium \u2013 although the\nfact that Bernard Sunley,\na former second year accommodation block, has\nbeen left empty for four\nyears beggars belief.\nBut we do lose something in the process \u2013\nsomething valuable that\nshould be mourned. We\nlose a bit of the Imperial\ncommunity. Yes, yes \u2013 it\nsounds like a joke. \u201cImperial sucks\u201d, I can hear\nyou cry out sarcastically,\n\u201cwhat community is there\nto lose?\u201d\nWell, actually, a pretty\nsignificant one. Being\ncrammed into this tiny\ncampus together is, I\nbelieve, a very significant\nreason why \u2013 counterin-tuitively to the popular\ngriping \u2013 there exists such\na strong student commu-nity. We have some of the\nhighest student election\nturnouts in the country;\nwe have one of, if not the,\nhighest number of student\nsocieties in the UK, many\nof them run by ridiculously dedicated members.\nConstituent Union teams\nput in ungodly hours on\ntop of their degrees. The\n568 Union bar staff have\ntheir own internal community to get each other\nthrough long nights \u2013 and\na thousand other organisations and study groups\nand campaigns and initiatives exist. We\u2019re actually\na highly engaged student\nbody.\nIn the end, we may all\nagree that being at Imperial is a bit rubbish \u2013 but\nthat collective whinging\nunites us. Our pessimism\nties us together.\nThat will die with the\nmulti-campus approach\n\u2013 the student body will\nfragment, no longer\nunified by the ability to\nmutually complain about\nthose things which affect\nus all. At the moment, the\nlibrary flooding screws us\nall over. In a few decades,\nit\u2019ll only be a small con-tingent. They will develop\ntheir own internal jokes\nabout it, but that will be\nmeaningless to those on\nthe other side of London.\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised\nto see a resulting decline\nin, for example, the election turnouts \u2013 after all,\nwhy vote for somebody\nwho you will never interact with and with whom\nyou share nothing in\ncommon? Their problems\nare no longer your own.\nAnd, with that comes the\nbreaking of a community\nwhich, let\u2019s face it, is\nmostly unified by Memeperial and IC Exposed/\nSecrets.\nWe see this already\nwith the separation of the\nmedics. They have their\nown jokes and experienc-es, their own clubs and\nsocieties, even their own\nbar in Reynolds. This\nself-imposed exile separates them from the rest of\nthe student body. I don\u2019t\nwish to cast aspersions,\nthat\u2019s just the nature of the\nbeast when the requirements of the medicine\ncourse are so different to\nmost degrees. My point is\nthat it would be a shame\nfor this fragmentation to\nfurther splinter the student\nbody.\nI worry that unless\nwe as a student body say\nsomething, the College\nisn\u2019t going to give a damn.\nFront Cover // Taja Strle\nI\n\n"

    "content": "50 years young \u2013 Led Zeppelin II celebrates half a\ncentury of blowing people\u2019s minds\n1969.Theyearofthemoonlanding.ThemiddleoftheVietnamwar.Onebandgaininghypefromtheirfirstalbum\nis soon to cement themselves in rock history with their second album: Led Zeppelin II. This week marks its 50th\nanniversary.\nMUSIC\nEmily Freeman\nMusic Editor\n\u201cLed Zeppelin\nII highlights\nthe bands evolving sound,\ncreeping from\nthe blues-inspired first\nalbum\u201d\nL\ned Zeppelin II\nwas formed out\nof incessant\npressure from\ntheir record label Atlantic\nRecords, who wanted to\nride on the hype of Led\nZeppelin\u2019s first album,\nLed Zeppelin, released\n7 months beforehand in\nMarch 1969. The important consequence of\nthis meant that recording\noccurred throughout\nthe multiple ongoing\nEuropean and American\ntours of the first album,\nand ultimately gave the\nalbum an urgent feel. This\ninsistent touring took its\ntoll on production: writing\nwould have to be squeezed\nin between travelling that\nmorning and performing\nthat evening, often in\nthat night\u2019s hotel room.\nRecording wasn\u2019t much\ndifferent, as sessions took\nplace in multiple studios\nacross London, LA, New\nYork, Memphis and \u2018the\nHut\u2019 in Vancouver, so\nnamed because it was\npoorly equipped but was\nall that was available for\nrecording. Jimmy Page\neventually commented\nthat he was \u201creally fed up\nof it (the album). I\u2019d just\nheard it so many times in\nso many places. I really\nthink I had lost confidence\nin it.\u201d Impressively, despite the restricted time,\nLed Zeppelin II highlights\nthe band\u2019s evolving\nsound, creeping from the\nblues-inspired first album\nto a heavier sound that also\nhints at the more acoustic\ndirection they were to take\non subsequent releases.\nThe album breaks\nopen with the iconic riff\nof \u2018Whole Lotta Love\u2019,\na staple of the Led Zepp\nsetlist, complete with\na swooning psychedelic middle section\nlovingly referred to as\n\u2018the freakout\u2019. This was\na result of Page and\nengineer Eddie Kramer\n\u201cflying around the room\u2026\ntwiddling every knob\nknown to man\u201d which\nmade a \u201ctechnique\u201d that\nwas extremely innovative\nfor its time. Other effects\nwere unintentional, including a happy accident\ninvolving Robert Plant\u2019s\nfaded vocals towards the\nend of the track, which\ncame about as a take bled\ninto the master vocal tape.\nInstead of re-recording,\nPage and Kramer added\nextra effects to highlight\nthe sound. Plant\u2019s vocals\non the entirety of this\nrecord have noticeably\nmatured from their\nprevious album, as have\nhis lyrics. The second\nsong \u2018What is and What\nShould Never Be\u2019 on\nthe album highlight this\nmore sophisticated lyrical\naspect, such as \u201cAnd happiness is what you need\nso bad/girl, the answer\nlies with you, yeah\u201d.\nEffects placed on Plant\u2019s\nvocals and again using the\n\u2018twiddling knobs\u2019 effect\nfrom \u2018Whole Lotta Love\u2019\ncombined in an overtly\npsychedelic noise.\nCracking open with\nanother classic Page riff,\n\u2018The Lemon Song\u2019swings\nback to Led Zepp\u2019s\nblues-inspired roots.\nSaid to have improvised\nthe entire thing, bassist\nJohn Paul Jones plays\na funked-up bassline,\nearning the song a medal\njust for it alone. The song\ntwists and turns, going\nfrom its jazzy riff to a\nPage guitar solo, into a\nstripped back section to\nallow the bassline to shine\nthrough and finally into\nan all-out rampage with\neveryone giving it their\nall. It\u2019s just an incredible\nsong. After the slap of\nthat, the album settles\ndown next into a matured,\nlighter sound with\n\u2018Thank You\u2019. This track\ninvolved Page playing\nboth 12-string electric\nand acoustic guitars, and\nwith Jones on an organ\nthis song truly steps back\nfrom the classic Led Zepp\nsound and ushers in the\never-evolving noise they\nwill introduce more of\non their next album Led\nZeppelin III. Once again\nPlant outdoes his former\nself lyrically: \u201clittle drops\nof rain whisper of the\npain/tears of loves lost\nin the days gone by\u201d. By\nexpressing his love for\nhis wife Maureen, Plant\ngives the song a beautiful\npoignant feel in true\nballad fashion.\nBusting out of that\nlovey nonsense, comes\n\u2018Heartbreaker\u2019, an absolutely iconic Led Zepp\nsong, complete with an\ninfectious Page riff and\nostentatious lyrics from\nPlant. \u201cHey fellas, have\nyou heard the news?/You\nknow that Annie\u2019s back\nin town?\u201d instantly brings\nthe listener in as Plant\u2019s\nconfidant, where we find\nout what Annie has done\nto Plant: \u201cone thing I do\nhave on my mind, if you\ncan clarify please do/is\nthe way you call me by\nanother man\u2019s name when\nI\u2019m trying to make love to\nyou\u201d.\nNaughty Annie. Plant\u2019s\nboasting but sad story\nis overlaid with Jones\u2019\nbubbling bassline and\nintertwined with many\nshowy Page solos (ap-parently, this song was\nwritten so Page could\nshow off his solo skills \u2013\ngo figure). Interestingly,\nif you listen closely you\ncan hear the difference\nbetween guitar tones of\nPage\u2019s riff and solo \u2013 an\nincontinuity due to recording in a different studio\nfrom where the rest was\nrecorded. Heartbreaker\nflows straight into \u2018Living\nLoving Maid (She\u2019s Just\na Woman)\u2019, a classic rock\nsong which paved the way\nfor many more classic\nrocks songs and majorly\ninfluenced the hair metal\nof the eighties. Whilst still\nbrilliant, this song lacks\nthe energy of Page\u2019s other\nriffs, perhaps indicating\nhis focus on making intricate and elaborate riffs\nand solos in other songs\non the album. \u2018Ramble\non\u2019 is an example of\nthe sort of thing Page\nis focussing on instead;\nagain, the band promote\nthat acoustic noise they\nwill move towards but\nwith it comes the heavy\nrock element, psychedelic\neffects and another intense\nPage riff. If one song were\nto summarise the album,\nit would be this one.\n\u2018Moby Dick\u2019 is a\nbreak for Plant\u2019s vocals\n\u2013 the instrumental song\nwas added to showcase\ndrummer John Bonham\u2019s\nabilities and is a writhing,\nbuilding song which well\ndisplays his capabilities.\nThe closing song, \u2018Bring\nit on Home\u2019, starts off\nwith mysterious bluesy\nharmonica before belting\ninto the typical Led Zepp\nnoise, accentuating the\nband\u2019s nod to their blues\nroute but ultimately\ndisplaying how they\nhave already outgrown\nthemselves in one certain\ngenre. This song seems\nto be their goodbye to\nclassic blues, before they\nwould shortly be defining\ntheir own genres and\ndefying others. In short,\nhappy birthday to one of\nthe most influential rock\nalbums the genre has ever\nseen.\nHappy Birthday and congrats on still being relevant // Fonts In Use\nMUSIC\nFRIDAY, 25TH\nOCTOBER, 2019 FELIX\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n20\n\n"

The\npiercing siren of a police\nvan shatters the silence\nof the night as it speeds\nonto the scene. Running\ntowards the van, a group\nof hooded people begin\nhurling rocks, debris and\nanything else to hand. The\nvan door flings open and\nriot police leap onto the\npavement and start chas-ing.

The\nrecent events broke out on\n14th of October when the\nSpanish Supreme Court\nsentenced nine former\nleaders of the Catalan\nindependence movement\nto up to 13 years of prison.\nThey were found guilty\nof sedition and misuse of\npublic funds.\nThat day a pro-inde-pendence crowd blocked\naccess to the airport of\nBarcelona, where more\nthan 100 flights were to\nbe cancelled as the crews\ncouldn\u2019t arrive to their\nworkstations.\nSince then, many\npeaceful mass protests\nhave taken place, with\nover 500,000 people\nattending the Marxes per\nla Llibertat (Marchs for\nFreedom) in central Barcelona last Friday. Many\nCatalonia after several\ndays of marching, causing\nthe closing of several\nhighways and roads.\nHowever, among them\nare around 2000 violent\nmasked youths that clash\nwith police forces every\nnight. Since the beginning\nof the protests, more than\n200 of them have been\narrested, including 100\nthat have already been\nbrought to justice.

The most recent\npeak episodes of the\nmovement occurred in\nOctober 2017 when an\nillegal referendum was\nheld, followed by a declaration of independence\nfrom the President of Catalonia Carles Puigdemont\nand its approval by the\nCatalan parliament, which\nis controlled by separatist\nparties.\nA judge ordered the detention of the movement\nleaders, but some of\nthem, like Puigdemont,\nhad already fled Spain.\nThe arrested leaders were\ncharged with rebellion\nby a public prosecutor,\nwho accused them of\npromoting the violence\nduring protests, especially\nthe ones that occured\nright before and during\nthe illegal referendum.\nMoreover, they were\ncharged with embezzlement for using public\nfunds to finance a banned\nvote.\nUltimately, the judge\nhas just found them guilty\nof sedition, which is a\nsimilar crime to rebellion\nin that it promotes the\nsubversion of the established order, but is not as\ngrave because the level of\nviolence is smaller.\nHowever, rather than\nwriting an end for this\nlong story, this seems to\nbecome just one more\nepisode of the long dispute\nbetween Spain.

For this exhibition,\nhe has gone through\nthe nooks and crannies\nof the V&A, one of his\nfavourite places in the\nworld, to find inspiration\nfor 10 new photo-worlds.\nGiven the fact that he is\na Londoner himself, this\nfeels very intimate, like\nstepping into his very\nown studio. Working with\nnames like Tilda Swinton,\nMargot Robbie, Timothee\nChalamet and Naomi\nCampbell, there is no need\nto wonder whether he is a\nbig name in the industry.\nWalker is at the top of\nthe fashion photography\ngame right now.\nFashion photography\nas a phenomenon is relatively new. It only started\nabout a hundred years\nago after a few decades\nof hand illustrated issues\nof Vogue and Harper\u2019s\nBazaar. Walker actually\nworked as an assistant for\none of the most influential\nphotographers of this new\nwave of fashion pho-tography, the American\nRichard Avenon. It is\nclear to see the influence\nof Avenon in Walker\u2019s\nwork, from using the\nsame models like Tilda\nSwinton to using animals\nand animal-like poses and\nexpressions.\nWalker plays with\ncolour, perspective and\nscale. He takes a concept\nand stretches it like a\nrubber band \u2013 to the max.\nSometimes the result is\nbrilliant. Sometimes the\nrubber band snaps; the\nphotos lose novelty. But\nmaybe this is what fashion\nphotography seems like to\nthe outsider. Fashion photography is intrinsically\nflashy. It is pictures of the\naristocrat, of a separate\nsocial class to the rest of\nus, wearing brands we\ncouldn\u2019t even dream of\nwearing in places we\u2019ll\nnever visit. It\u2019s built upon\nan aura of unattainability.\nMaybe this is why I\u2019m\nmostly drawn to his\ntravel photography, which\nconstitutes one of the ten\nworlds Walker has built\ninside the exhibition. The\nphotos here are still staged\nand have elements of\nsilky dresses, pearls and\nperfectly done makeup\nin them. But rather than\nbeing taken in a studio\nthey\u2019re taken in an organic\nenvironment.\nThat\u2019s not to say some\nof Walker\u2019s shots aren\u2019t\nabsolutely ingenious.\nThey\u2019re taken straight\nout of a gleaming dream\nor a beautiful nightmare.\nIt is definitely worth\nchecking out for yourself.\nIf the premise of fashion\nphotography is to awe the\nviewer, Tim Walker hits\njackpot this time.\nV&A Tim Walker Wonderful Things Exhibition\u2018Pen & Ink\u2019Seection // V&A Museum\nISSUE 1731\nFELIX\n15\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nAmanda Hertzberg\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Moreover, dairy\nproduction is more land\nand water intensive\ncompared to the production of other plant-based\nmilks, making it a triple\nthreat to the environment\nand its scarce resources.\nBy making dairy\noptions cheaper than\nplant-based ones, it is\nsafe to say that customers will be less keen\nto reduce their dairy\nintake, leading to further\nfuelling of the ongoing\nclimate crisis.\nNon-dairy milk options are also often\nhealthier\nAs much of the fat in\nregular milk is saturat-ed, the NHS has warned\nthat excess consumption\ncould potentially lead to\nweight gain and raised\ncholesterol levels,\nputting one at increased\nrisk of heart attack and\nstroke.\nMilk also may contain\nantibiotics (used by\nfarmers to prevent cows\nfrom getting sick),\nwhich may have an\nadverse effect on gut\nhealth, by damaging\ngood bacteria, and disrupting the balance of\ngut microbiome.\nOn the other hand,\nplant-based milks\ncontain largely unsaturated fats, is high in\nfibre, is antibiotic-free,\nand offer a plethora of\nadded health benefits\nwhen fortified with\ncalcium and vitamins.\nThe environmental\nimpact of plant-based\nmilk varies\nThough proving to\nbe far better alternatives than the standard\ndairy options, different\nplant-based milks have\nvarying degrees of effectiveness in protecting\nthe Earth.\nFor instance, soybeans\nand almonds grow in\nconditions unlike those\nin the UK, chalking up\nhefty environmental\ndemerit points due to\nfuel consumption from\ntheir transportation.\nAt the same time, the\nproduction of almond\nmilk is the most water-in-tensive out of all other\nplant-based milks, with\na single glass requiring\n74 litres (more than the\ntypical shower!). Not far\nbehind, rice milk is the\nsecond thirstiest on the\nlist, with a total of 54\nlitres of water used to\nmake one glass.\nHowever, it must be\nnoted that these plant-based alternatives are\nstill far superior to dairy\nmilk when comparing\ndifferent factors of environmental friendliness.\nFighting to abolish\nthe surcharge\nThankfully, a student\nhas boldly stepped\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFELIX ISSUE 1731\nsustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nthere could (and should)\nbe far more!\nBy taking less than a\nminute of your time to\nfill in her short survey\n(accessed via the QR\ncode below), you too\ncan be a proponent for\na more plant-based\nImperial.\nEven if you happen to\nagree with the surcharge,\nit would be great to type\nin your responses so that\nFrancesca understands\nwhere you are coming\nfrom and can represent\nyou accurately.\nIn summary\nWith the thermostat\nquickly dropping as\nwinter approaches, the\nnew charges imposed\ncould not have come at\na worse time as students\nand staff turn to hot\ndrinks to warm up.\nThis 30p fee, though\nnumerically small, is a\nbig statement that shed\nlights on the university\u2019s\ntrue attitude towards\nsustainability.\nAs the school body,\nour collective voice has\nthe power to champion\nthe fight for a healthier\nplanet.

Thus,\nFrancesca believes that\nthe 30p surcharge could\nnegatively affect the\nsales of campus food\noutlets as people who do\nnot or cannot consume\ndairy may reduce or\ncompletely stop purchasing hot drinks from\nthem.\nMoreover, she\nbelieves that this form\nof tax disincentivises\npeople from making an\neffort to reduce their\ndairy consumption\nand carbon footprint,\nespecially since 30p is a\ndisproportionately high\ncharge for the small\nvolume of plant-based\nmilk in one hot drink.\nYour invaluable role\nin this campaign\nTo ensure that views\nof the Imperial body are\nheard, Francesca has\ncreated a quick survey\nto gather perspectives\nto present during\nher meeting with the\nImperial catering leadership team.

The\nlease for Fusion was\ncoming to an end, so the\nCollege re-evaluated the\nviability of taking over\nthat service and realised\nthey could do it better.\nHowever, for other outlets\nlike NeoPizza or Kimiko\nin the JCR, that capacity\nmay not be there \u2013 for\nexample, Kimiko have\nhigh buying power due to\nbuying in bulk, whereas\nthe College doesn\u2019t sell\nthat food elsewhere and so\nwould be buying smaller\namounts which is more\nexpensive. That means\nthey wouldn\u2019t be able to\noperate it cheaper, and\nthere\u2019s just no reason to\nif they have to increase\nprices and operate on a\nloss.\nFelix: Tell us a bit\nmore about the\nchanges in Reynolds?\nFH: It was one of the\nfirst things I worked on\nwhen I came into office in\nAugust! They wanted to\nrebrand slightly \u2013 they\u2019ve\nrepainted surfaces and\nput new vinyls in the\nwindow, which looks a lot\nnicer than the old peeling\nstickers. I talked with\nBen, the ICSMSU President, about the changes\nas well, which was nice.\nThey\u2019ve also updated\ntheir food and drink menu\n\u2013 Reynolds operates a bit\nlike h-bar used to, with\na Union bar side and a\nCollege-run food side.\nThe student experience\nsurvey showed students\nwanted more branded\nitems, so they\u2019ve included\nStarbucks, as well as\nlooking into offering hot\nfood like jacket potatoes\nand pastries.\nFelix: Speaking of\nh-bar, what\u2019s happening with the food\nservice there? Was it\nnot meant to begin\nbefore term started?\nFH: For context, the\nCollege decided last year\nto cut their late night tapas\nfood service, which ran\nfrom 7pm until shortly\nbefore closing, and the\nUnion began talks with\nthe College to take it\nover from 7pm onwards.\nPlans were set up, and we\nconducted food-tasting\nFifi Henry, the DPFS // ICU\n\n"

It takes\na comedic turn on the\nmythology of the birth of\nan Antichrist and coming\nof the end times, with an\nangel and a demon lurking\naround here and there.\nThe prophecy of an\napocalypse and Armageddon, the final battle\nbetween heaven and hell,\nis about to come true\nwith the birth of Adam,\nthe son of Satan. Due to\nsome mishandlings in a\nsatanic convent, both the\nangel Aziraphale (played\nby Michael Sheen) and\ndemon Crowley (played\nby David Tennant) have\nlost track of Adam and\nmust team up to find\nhim and prevent the\nFinal Judgement. The\ntale begins in the Garden\nof Eden, transcending\nhistory from Noah\u2019s Ark\nto French Revolution\nto London Blitz in the\nSecond World War.\nThe duo, who has been\nGood Omens// IMDb\nTELEVISION\nJia Qi Tan\nTelevision Editor\nCreator: Neil Gaiman.\nStarring: Michael Sheen,\nDavid Tennant, Sam Taylor\nBuck, Adria Arjona\nfraternising for centuries\non earth despite being on\nopposite sides, has taken\na liking to mankind and\nattempts to save the world.\nMultiple subplots\ncomplement the main sto-ryline, and although out of\nplace at times, manage to\ncome together at the finale.\nFirst and foremost is the\ntale surrounding The Nice\nand Accurate Prophecies\nof Agnes Nutter, Witch,\nstarting from the burning\nof Agnes Nutter herself in\nthe 17th century and her\ndescendants up until the\ncurrent witch Anathema\nDevice inheriting her\nprophecies. The subplot\nof Adam being mixed up\nduring his birth is interesting to begin with, but the\nscenes following Adam\u2019s\nupbringing appear to be\nquite detached from the\nmain arc and comes across\nas a little incoherent and\nunrealistic. The part concerning the summoning of\nthe Four Horsemen of the\nApocalypse, although excellent all by themselves,\ndo not fit into the overall\npalette of Good Omens.\nThis brings me to my\nmain problem with the\nplot. Although all scenes\nare beautifully crafted\nout, they lack an inherent\ncoherence. Additionally,\ncertain subplots often pale\nin comparison to the main\nnarrative and could have\nbeen fleshed out better.\nAll in all, while the story\nremains delightfully en-tertaining, it leaves a little\nsomething to be desired.\nFor any TV show, the\nproduction set serves a\ncrucial role in bringing\nthe story to life. It is no\ndifferent in Good Omens,\nespecially given the range\nit covers historically and\ngeographically. Thanks\nto the way the scenes are\nframed, an angel and a\ndemon never feel out of\nplace, as they simply hang\naround in different corners\nof London, be it in Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre or\nAziraphale\u2019s bookshop or\nSt. James\u2019s Park. But what\nreally drew my attention\nis the way heaven and\nhell are depicted, with\nheaven taking the form\nof a modernised office in\na skyscraper, while hell\nbeing a crowded basement\nlot where the sun never\nshines. This portrayal is\none I never thought about,\nbut it comes across as\nsurprisingly accurate and\ntheme-fitting. Creative\ntakes are especially\nnecessary for the fantasy\ngenre, and Good Omens\nhas definitely gone above\nand beyond in this arena.\nAll characters in Good\nOmens are wonderfully\ncrafted and cast, especially for the leads Aziraphale\nand Crowley. The angel\nAziraphale is an adorable,\nsoft-spoken angel whom\none cannot help but love,\nand the same goes for\nCrowley who is equally\ncharming despite being a\nchaotic, tempting demon.\nSheen captures the\nessence of Aziraphale\u2019s\npersonality perfectly, like\na puff of fluffy cotton\ncandy, and Tennant\u2019s\n\u201cLike a puff of\nfluffy cotton\ncandy\u201c\nacting is absolutely on\npoint and could not have\nbeen a better fit as the\nsarcastic demon that is\nCrowley. The chemistry\nbetween the two definitely\nmakes the show, and any\nscenes with them are\nsimply golden.\nFrom the moment I\nclicked on the trailer\nand heard Queen and\nDavid Bowie\u2019s \u201cUnder\nPressure\u201d, I had high\nexpectations for Good\nOmens\u2019s soundtrack,\nand it did not disap-point. Every scene with\nCrowley features Queen\nin the background, be it\n\u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d\nas he picks up the son of\nSatan for the baby-swap\nbringing life to the lyrics\n\u201cBeelzebub has a devil put\naside for me\u201d, or \u201cAnother\nOne Bites the Dust\u201d as\nCrowley falls into his own\ntrap, or \u201cWe Will Rock\nYou\u201d as he drives his\nflaming Bentley. Queen\u2019s\nrebellious, unique, bor-derline-devilish music\nfits Crowley\u2019s edge and\nswagger. Who knew Good\nOmens and Queen were a\nmatch made in heaven?\nAll in all, I probably\ncan\u2019t help myself but\ncontinue to rewatch Good\n\u201cThe duo\nhas been\nfraternising for\ncenturies\u201c\nOmens every now and\nthen just for Aziraphale\nand Crowley\u2019s incandescent chemistry. (Plus,\nit\u2019s a lot of fun spotting\nSherlock easter eggs.)\nWhile the narrative could\nhave been stronger, Sheen\nand Tennant\u2019s chemistry\nis all the reason you need\nto watch this intoxicating,\nquirky, binge-worthy\nseries.\n\n"

I only really\ngot into it during my gap\nyear. That\u2019s when I did\nmy Walland Hill EP, just\nbefore going travelling.\nBut I hadn\u2019t really done\nany music until January\nthis year.\nFelix: Really? Ever?\nRJ: So, I used to produce\ndrum and bass stuff, like\n3 years ago. But \u2018Waiting\nfor Something\u2019 in January\nwas the first song as Roy\nJuxon. I didn\u2019t really tell\nanyone about it, just tried\nto plug it to a few random\npeople and they kinda\nliked it so I decided to\nkeep trying stuff out. My\nfirst proper public track\nwas \u2018Self-reflection\u2019. That\nwas the first one I let my\nfriends hear.\nFelix: I find it interesting that \u2018Waiting for\nSomething\u2019 was your\nfirst track because\nI think a lot people\nwould just be messing\nabout with their very\nfirst song to see what\nworks, but it\u2019s actually\ngot quite a deep\ntheme to it \u2013 was there\nsomething specific that\ninspired it?\nRJ: It was kind of inspired\nby this bridge outside\nthe David Lloyd I was\nworking at at the time.\nPeople said someone had\ncommitted suicide by\njumping off it. It\u2019s kind of\nabout the thought process\nabout wanting to jump\nand then jumping, and\n\u201cwaiting for something\u201d\nas in waiting for something good to happen.\nFelix: So where did you\ngrow up? And what did\nyou listen to growing\nup?\nRJ: I\u2019m from Exeter,\ndown south. I\u2019ve always\ndone classical music \u2013 like\nopera stuff. I didn\u2019t really\nlisten to that stuff though.\nI had my Eminem phase\nand then I went through\n90s and 00s hip hop.\nThen I started listening to\nmore alternative stuff and\ngrunge. It was Swimming\nby Mac Miller that made\nme fall back in love with\nhip hop, and I just went\nthrough the modern\ngreats after that \u2013 J.Cole,\nKendrick.\nFelix: I feel like that\nalbum hinted at him\nfinally being able to\n\u201cI just want\nwhatever I\nput out out\nto be of a\nprofessional\nstandard\u201d\ncope with stuff. And\nthat was just so tragically juxtaposed by his\ndeath.\nRJ: That\u2019s part of why it\u2019s\nbecome so iconic. Like\nthe last song, \u2018So It Goes\u2019,\nhe\u2019s like saying people die\nand it\u2019s just whatever. And\nthen literally a month later\nthat happens.\nFelix: We\u2019ve had a lot\nof deaths in hip hop\nrecently. Especially of\nrappers whose music\nis very personal for\nfans \u2013 Peep, XXX, Mac.\nDo many artists have a\npersonal impact on you\nthat inspires your style?\nRJ: At the moment, I\u2019m\nvery much just starting\nout. Like, \u2018Confusion\u2019 is\nthe first song I\u2019ve put on\nSpotify. So I\u2019m still just\ntrying to find my style.\nIn terms of influence,\nwhenever I find a new\nartist or am listening to a\nsong and really like it, I\njust try and do a song in\na similar style to that. So\nsomething like \u2018START\u2019\n\u2013 have you listened to that\none?\nFelix: Yeah, it\u2019s very\nJaden Smith.\nRJ: Yeah, very Jaden\nSmith and also Travis\nScott. I liked that bit with\nthat synth scale run kind\nof thing in \u2018Butterfly\nEffect\u2019 so I tried to just\nput that in, and also take\ninspiration from his use of\nautotune.\nFelix: Sodoyouhandle\nyour own production\nthen?\nRJ: No, I generally go\nout to external producers,\nmainly because I know\nhow time consuming it can\nbe to produce a track. My\nthinking is that I just want\nto get some momentum\nright now, actually get\ntracks out. Then once I\u2019ve\ngot that, maybe I can begin\nto focus on doing more of\nmy own production.\nFelix: What\u2019s your song\nwriting method like?\nRJ: I always start with the\nchorus, I\u2019m only really\nmotivated to work on a\nverse once I have a catchy\nchorus. And then from the\nchorus I go to theme, and\nthen the theme leads to\nme freestyling a verse just\nto get a flow. And then\nonce I have the flow, I just\nre-write the verse with the\nlyrics that I want.\nFelix: Tell me a bit\nabout Walland Hill EP.\nRJ: So, my old house\nwas called Walland Hill.\nMoving was quite melancholic and I wanted to put\ntogether a concise project\nthat reflected on that\ntime in my life. \u2018Hours\u2019\nand \u2018Summer She Said\u2019\nare about my girlfriend,\n\u2018Self Reflection\u2019 is kind\nof about not wanting to\nwaste away my life in\na 9-5 and then \u2018Lost a\nFriend\u2019is about how while\nstudying I sometimes tend\nto lose my creative side\nand wanting to get back in\ntouch with it.\nFelix: Would you ever\nconsider working on a\ncomplete album?\nRJ: Not for the time being,\nI\u2019d only do that if I had\nthe opportunity to work\non it full time. I\u2019m quite\nenjoying singles for the\ntime being. It means I\ncan enjoy the excitement\nof releasing regularly.\nAnd they\u2019re all their own\nentity, so that lets me get a\nbit of variety.\nFelix: Are you kind of\nsettled into a routine\nnow with balancing uni\nand music, or do you\ntend to question which\npath is more important\nto you?\nRJ: I think if I could do\nit full time and sustain it,\nI would. I quite like the\nbalance though. If there\u2019s\never a day where the\nmusic isn\u2019t very good, at\nleast I have maths, and\nvice versa. And also, for\nthe time being, I am able\nto successfully release a\nsingle at least every one\nor two months. Because in\nthe Summer I made a load\nof songs that I can now\nprogressively release. I\u2019ll\nprobably release a song\ncalled \u2018Out of Touch\u2019\nwithin the next six weeks.\nI\u2019ve got others that are\ndone too but I don\u2019t think\nthey\u2019re up to scratch for\nme to release \u2013 I just want\nwhatever I put out to be of\na professional standard.\nCheck out Roy Juxon on\nSoundCloud, his new\nsingle \u2018Confusion\u2019 is out\nnow.

This\nis a great start\n- but it's not\nthe end of\nthe road. We\nhave to keep\nmomentum\u201d\nMarch are very busy\ntimes of year. Having the\nstaff to reach the 7 to 10\nday goal in busy times\nmeans having a lot of staff\nwith not enough to do at\nother times.\u201d\nIn considering the\npossibility of interim staff\nfor busy periods, further\nproblems arise. Any\nstudent could then form a\ngood relationship with a\ncounsellor that they could\nnot then speak to later \u2013\nwhich especially affects\nPhD students who are at\nthe College year-round.\nThere are also problems\nwith training new staff\nsimply to have them leave\nimmediately afterwards,\nas well as finding skilled\ncandidates who only want\nshort-term work.\nThe end result is that\nthe 7 to 10 day goal is an\n\u201caverage\u201d throughout the\nyear, with waiting times\nrising and falling around\nthat benchmark.\nThe newly available\nspace could also potentially accommodate\nother wellbeing services\nthat need to expand. The\nDisabilities Advisory\nService (DAS) is similarly crammed into Sherfield, with offices spread\nacross the 5th floor \u2013 and\nentrances located right\noutside lecture theatres,\nwhich can make students\nfeel awkward to enter.\nThis potential is one\nthat inspires Rosie in\nparticular, who shared\na personal vision for a\nbespoke \u2018wellbeing hub\u2019\nfor students. This would\nhouse the Student Counselling and Mental Health\nAdvice Service as well as\nthe DAS, along with other\nprovisions for students\u2019\nholistic wellness.\nHannah Bannister, the\nDirector for Student Services, shared this view-point: \u201cI\u2019d like a \u2018student\ncentre\u2019 bringing together\nmost of the non-depart-mental services in one\nplace that students can\naccess \u2013 including the\nservices in my remit such\nas the DAS, counselling,\nand the careers service,\nbut also others such as\nregistry services. Students\nshould be able to come\nwith any question and get\nan answer or see someone\nquickly.\u201d\nHowever, a centralised\nhub near South Kensington would not address\none of the core problems\nstill facing the counselling\nservice: the lack of an\noffice in White City \u2013 although Hannah suggests\nthat should the White City\ncampus grow, hubs could\nbe included in both places.\nCounselling have been\ntrying to find a space in\nWhite City for around\nseven years, but have\nthus far only been offered\nspaces that were unusable\nor were eventually bookmarked for other uses.\nRecent attempts began\napproximately 2.5 years\nago, the first of which\nended in the space being\ngiven to medicine \u2013 and\nunfortunately,nothingwas\nreserved for the service\nwhen chemistry moved to\nthe campus. Successively,\nnew spaces were offered,\nbut each was turned down\ndue to the inappropriate\nnature of the entrance.\nSeveral had full glass\nfronts and were adjacent\nto academics\u2019 offices and\nwork spaces or common\nrooms for students \u2013 a\nfailure to acknowledge\nthe particular essential\nneeds of the counselling\nservice.\nA similar problem has\narisen at Hammersmith\nHospital, which is a short\nwalk from White City.\nAlthough counselling\nhas been offered there\nfor eight years, the area\noutside the meeting room\nhas now been renovated\nto feature working desks,\nrendering the office unusable for counselling \u2013 it\nwill be shut down next\nweek. Although an alternative allocated space has\nbeen identified for use five\ndays a week, it is outside\nlecture theatres \u2013 and\nneeds to be completely\nrefurbished, meaning it\nwill not open until at least\nthe 6th of January.\nThe frustration at this\nsituation is pervasive\n\u2013 however, it is out-matched by the strong\nsense of future potential\nthat is felt throughout the\nservice. There is no sense\nof complacency. Instead,\nthere is a strong desire to\nimprove and grow further\nto meet the needs of students \u2013 and in particular\nto engage in interlinked\ninitiatives with other\nwellbeing services across\nthe College community.\nClaire explained:\n\u201cThe strength that the\nstudent counselling and\nmental health team have\nat Imperial is that we are\nan embedded, integrated\nservice \u2013 not an outsourced agency providing\nit for the university. We\nare embedded because we\nare based at the College,\nand integrated because we\ntalk to and work alongside\nacademic departments\nand other support teams.\nWe have that holistic view\nof the whole student experience and understand\nthe student journey \u2013 we\naren\u2019t in a bubble, we are\nlinked in. I want to see\nmore such linkage.\u201d\nCurrently, decisions\nat the College are often\nmade in isolated \u201csilos\u201d\n\u2013 for example, every\nfaculty addresses wellbeing and mental health on a\nseparate basis, rather than\nfully coordinating jointly,\nwhich could lead to\nacross the College \u2013 as\nClaire explained it, \u201cwe\nwant to have consistency\nacross the whole univer-sity, so you know exactly\nwhat support you have\naccess to regardless of\nwhat department you are\nin.\u201d The group found that\nbroadly the provision is\nequal across departments.\nMore essentially, it found\na lot of positive benefit to\nmeeting in person \u2013 and\nso also plans to propose\nsetting up a network of\nstudent support practition-ers, where developments\nand learning can be\nshared, and recommendations can be made that\ncan then be put before a\ndecision-making body\nwith a unified voice. This\nis another step towards\nthe idea of \u201cjoined-up\nthinking.\u201d\nThe resulting feeling\nis that this is just the first\nstep in a much broader\npush for resource allocation to wellbeing services\n\u2013 a vital change given\nthe College\u2019s notoriously\nlow student satisfaction\nscores. Hannah is already\npushing for consideration\nof this:\n\u201cThe College is\nconsidering a proposed\nStudent Support Strategy\ncreated in collaboration\nwith last year\u2019s Union\nOfficer Trustees, which\nwill hopefully be signed\noff next week as College\npolicy. One of the strands\nin that is asking the\nCollege to commit to\nconsidering students and\nstudent needs when planning discussions around\nspace, as the College is\nfundamentally changing\ntoward a multi-campus\napproach.\u201d\nAs best summated by\nClaire herself:\n\u201cThe whole conversation around space is really\nabout value \u2013 it\u2019s about the\npriority we put on student\nexperience and their\nmental wellness. What is\nthe value that Imperial is\nplacing on that; what are\nthey doing about it; what\nspace are they offering.\nThere is no point in just\ntalking a big game. You\nhave to actually walk the\ntalk. This is a great start\nhere \u2013 but it\u2019s not the end\nof the road. Let\u2019s keep\nmoving forward, and keep\nmomentum in terms of\nthe big picture of student\nsupport.\u201d\nThe new space is airy and professional // Henry Alman\ndisparities in the support\navailable to different\nstudents.\nA \u2018Task and Finish\nGroup\u2019, led by Hannah,\nrecently looked into how\nto ensure parity of support\n\n"

The bill outlines\nthe terms on which Britain will leave the EU and\nincludes an exit fee, the price sum has not yet\nbeen established, to be paid by the UK to the EU.\nThe terms are similar to those proposed by Theresa May with the key distinction being Northern\nIreland. The bill suggests that it would continue\nto abide by the EU customs regime, which permits free trade within the union.\nMPs were given 3 days to critique\nthe bill before a final decision was\nto be made. The short timeframe\nfor a such a voluminous and significant piece of potential\nlegislation resulted in backlash\nfrom opposition parties.\nThe government voted to pass the\nwithdrawal agreement bill onto its\nsecond reading. The outcome of the\nvote was in support of the prime minister\u2019s bill 329-299.\nNineteen Labour MPs, of the 245\nseated in the house of commons,\nvoted in favour of the motion and in\ndoing so neglected the labour whip to\noppose it, with many reasoning that\nthey have a duty to fulfil the wishes\nof their constituencies. Despite this\ntriumph for Johnson, with it being\nthe first time parliament has voted\nin favour of a Brexit agreement, his\nvictory was short lived.\nLast week and Monday\nMPs also voted on the PMs motion to\npush the bill through in three days. Unfortunately for the prime minister, his\nthree day plan was rejected with the\nvotes outcome being a 308-322 defeat.\nThe prime minister has sent a letter to\nthe EU calling for a three month exten-sion, meaning Britain would leave the\nEU on January 31st. However, Johnson\nhas previously stated that in the case\nof another extension, he would call a\ngeneral election. motion and in doing\nso neglected the labour whip to oppose\nit, with many reasoning that they have\na duty to fulfil the wishes of their con-stituencies.\nThe most likely outcome and one which the prime\nminister himself expects to happen, in which case\nhe is planning to hold a general election on 12 December. For an early election to occur, two thirds\nof parliament must vote in favour of the motion.\nA member of the labour shadow cabinet has stated\nthat that labour will support the prime minister\u2019s\nplan if the possibility of a no deal is ruled out. If\nan election is agreed to, the conservative will try to\nget their current deal through before beginning to\ncampaign.\nA less likely scenario but Johnson\u2019s preferred option. He will\nattempt to get his current deal\nthrough parliament. With Labour\u2019s convicted opposition to a\nno deal scenario, it\u2019s likely that\nthey would cooperate with the\nprime minister\u2019s efforts.\nFull extension to January 31st\nTuesday 22nd October\nShorter extension\nElection Section:\nCanada\u2019s Trudeau wins minority government\nW\nhen first\ne l e c t e d\nas the\nC a n a d i a n\nPrime Minister in 2015,\nJustin Trudeau was a\nbreath of fresh air for a\ncountry that for 9 years\nhad been governed by\nthe Conservative Stephen\nHarper.

That year, the Liberal\nParty won 184 seats in the\nHouse of Commons, up\nfrom 36 in the previous\nelection, and Trudeau won\n39.5% of the popular vote.\nOnTuesday,thecountry\nheld their 43rd general\nelection. Justin Trudeau\nlost his House majority as\nwell as the popular vote\nby a slight margin, leaving\nthe Liberal Party to form\na minority government.\nHe thus remains Canada\u2019s\nPrime Minister, but his\nnarrow victory reflects his\ndeclining popularity over\nthe recent spate of and\nscandals.\nOne of these involves\nthe engineering firm SNC\nLavalin charged with\ncorruption, and efforts by\nTrudeau\u2019s government\nto pressure the former\nAttorney General to\nhand down a lighter\npunishment, an improper\npolitical interference in\njustice matters. The other\ninvolves multiple pictures\nof Trudeau wearing black-face/brownface resurfac-ing, with him eventually\nadmitting that he has lost\ncount of the number of\ntimes he has worn it.\nIn this context, it\u2019s\nclear to see how his reputation as a progressive\nhero has eroded. The\nAttorney General that\nhe tried to pressue into\ngiving SNC Lavalin a less\nharsh sentence, and later\ndemoted for not willing to\ndo so, was at the time the\nmost senior government\nofficial who is a member\nof the First Nation. His\nbrownface incidence\nbrings to mind his uncomfortably costume-like\nattire when visiting India,\nfor which he then explained that he has always\n\u201cbeen more enthusiastic\nabout costumes than is\nsometimes appropriate.\u201d\nIt\u2019s safe to say that\nCanadians are choosing to\nWhat next?\nkeep in in office because\nhe is simply better than\nthe alternative.\nWithout a House\nmajority to pass legislation on their own, the\nLiberal Party will have\nto form a coalition with\nother parties, likely the\nleft-wing New Democratic Party.\n\n"

    "content": "GAMES\nFRIDAY, 25TH OCTOBER, 2019 FELIX\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28\nPOV: The 2019 CTWC - The Year of Upsetris\nF\nollowing on\nfrom last week\u2019s\narticle covering\nthe Classic Tetris\nWorld Championship, it is\ntime to share the results!\nIt took place from the\n19th - 21st and I was\nfollowing it the whole\nway. Friday started\nfairly low-key. A quick\nDr. Mario tournament\nfollowed by a speedrun\ncompetition in Tetris: first\nto level 19. Surprisingly,\nlast year\u2019s champion,\nJoseph Saelee, lost quite\nearly on in the speedrun\ncontest... I guess he was\njust warming up for the\nreal action.\nSaturday was the first\nday of qualifying, in\nwhich there were some\nvery notable highlights.\nFirstly, Joeseph qualified\nfirst (surprising no one)\nbut to everyone\u2019s amazement he did this with at\nleast 3 max outs, (the\nmax score you can get is\n999,999). The qualifying\nhad many fresh young\nfaces, including Batfoy...\nwho would go on to come\n4th place which will\nbe covered later. Many\npeople are accounting\nthe reason for this influx\nof young players being\nthe success of 16-year olf\nJoseph Saelee last year.\nFollowing this trend of di-versity. it was nice to see\nmore women take part, including one player\u2019s wife\nwho managed to demolish\nhim in qualifying.\nThe Sunday was the\nreal show though, top 36\nthe clash of the titans. The\nday started with two major\nupsets. Two of the three\nprevious winners Harry\nHong and Jonas Neubauer\nboth were knocked out\nat the start of the day.\nThis shocked the Tetris\nwell, causing everyone\nto dub the tournament as\nthe tourney of \u2018upsetris\u2019.\nEven weirder still is the\nplayer that beat 7-time\nworld champion Jonas did\nnot manage to get through\nto the next round.\nTop 8 was wild. A\nshowdown of veterans,\nTerry and Koryan,\nshowed the world how\nbig of a skill difference\ncan come with continued\npractice. Koryan practices\nevery day, even when\nhe is not playing Tetris\nhe taps a portable button\nto keep his fingers fast.\nThis was evident in the\nabsolute destruction that\nwas Koryans 3-0 victory\nover Terry. Joseph went\nagainst Green Tea in\nprobably the best match of\nthe tournament. The first\ngame saw both players\nget to the kill-screen (the\nend of the game which\nis so rarely reached in\ntournament). The next\ngame saw Joeseph get\nthe first-ever max out\nin a head-to-head tournament setting, causing\nthe commentators to go\ncrazy. But nothing would\nprepare them for the next\ngame which saw a max\nout from BOTH Joseph\nAND Green Tea - truly\nextraordinary. Batfoy the\n15-year-old newcomer\nwas sadly beaten by 40+\nyear old veteran Koryan.\nThis meant that Koryan\nmet joseph in the final.\nA hotly contested match\nwas finally clutched out\nby Joseph, winning by 3-2\nwhen Koryan topped out\nearly at 200,000 points.\nJoseph was awarded\na beautiful trophy and\n$10,000 by Alexy\nPajitnow, Tetris\u2019 creator.\nAn emotional moment\nand a great competition\nby all!\nPOV: Super Mario Bros. Film Because That Exists!\nT\nhis week I sacrificed my Sunday\nevening to watch\n(again) the horrific video game movie that\nis \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d.\nDirected by Rocky\nMorton and Annabel\nJankel, the film was both\natrocious in its directing\nand actual content, with\nso much miscommuni-cation between previous\ndirectors and Nintendo\nthat the eventual product\nwas a gritty mushroom\nkingdom complete with\nstrippers (I wish I was\nkidding). What makes\nthis film even worse is\nthat fact that it features\na star-studded cast with\nBob Hoskins as Mario,\nJohn Leguizamo as Luigi,\nDennis Hopper as Bowser\n- a role that was offered\nand turned down by both\nArnold Schwarzenegger\nand Michael Keatonand Samantha Mathis as\nPrincess Daisy. Now you\nmay be thinking that the\nfilm surely could not have\nbeen that bad, to which I\nwould reply, \u201cthe actors\nactually drank on set in\norder to get through this\nmovie\u201d and \u201cBob Hoskin\ndescribed it as the worst\njob he has ever done and\nthe biggest mistake of his\nlife\u201d. In both directing\nand content, the film was\nawful.\nHeaven help me, I was\ngoing to write a whole\nsection about the story \u2026\nbut realising how many\n\u201ccrucial\u201d details I would\nleave out has led me to\nadvise you to read the plot\nfrom the wiki page \u2013 it\npaints a better picture of\nthe film\u2019s LSD-esque\nnightmare then I will\never be able to achieve,\nliterally one of the lines\nfrom the wiki reads\n\u201cKoopa informs Daisy\nthat she descended from\nthe dinosaurs, believing\nonly Daisy can merge\nthe worlds because of her\nroyal heritage\u201d, which\nis completely accurate\nto the film. Allow me to\nprovide you with further\nexamples of how poorly\nthings crossed over from\nthe game to the movie, for\nstarters, Goomba are now\n7 feet tall monstrosities\nthat are built like a brick\nshit house and have heads\nthe size of an 8 ball, Yoshi\nis a small but somehow\ncreepily adorable ve-lociraptor, the entire city\nof Dinohatten- I kid you\nnot, that they actually\ncalled it that- is coated\nin white fibrous material\nwhich is apparently the\nremains of the king that\nhas been turned into a\nsentient fungus. Last but\nnot least the film features\nMario teaming up with a\ntight leather clad dance\nfloor queen named Big\nBertha \u2013 that\u2019s not a\ncrossover I just thought\nI\u2019d mention that. The\nwonders of Hollywood\ncontinue to amaze me!\nIf you\u2019re going to watch\nthe movie (which I advise\nyou do), watch it like the\nactors: drunk.\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\nGAMES\nConnor Winzar\nGames Editor\nJoseph (left) seen posing next to Alexy Pajitnov (right) // Tetris\nBecause there is no God // Buena Vista Pictures Distribution\n\n"

Jump into a mythical world and battle demons... with your\nabs! A intense daily workout for anyone, anytime, anywhere!\nT\nhe latest in a\nlong-running list\nof Nintendo\u2019s\nwhacky peripheral ideas: Ring Fit\nAdventure, fight demons\nwhilst doing pilates.\nLast month Nintendo\nannounced the game\nseemingly out of nowhere.\nThe premise is odd, attach\na joy-con to your left leg\nvia a strap and attach\nanother to the top of a\nNintendo-made, plastic\npilates ring dubbed the\nring-con. The joy-con\u2019s\ninbuilt gyroscopes can\nmeasure (to a surprisingly\nhigh precision) the movement of your upper and\nlower body. The game\nuses this premise and\npushes it to its max with\nmultiple immersive game\nmodes and a jarringly\nintense workout to boot!\nWhen I first popped in\nthe game, I was given very\ndetailed instructions on\nhow to attach the equipment and how to follow\nthe in-game prompts.\nYou control the menu by\nspinning and turning the\nring-con which is very\nintuitive. Before playing\nthe main story, I attempted to storm through all\nthe mini-games. There\nis a wide variety of\nmini-games which target\nalmost every muscle\ngroup. While playing the\nmini-games there is an\non-screen guide, called\nTipp, which shows you\nthe correct way to do the\nexercise without injuring\nyourself. This self-care\ntheme is very prevalent\nin the game. Nintendo\nknows that a large portion\nof their fanbase doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily know a lot\nabout fitness; there are\nalways tips on how to eat,\nhow to do the exercise and\nconstant reminders to stay\nhydrated. Given that I had\nto play an average of 4\nhours per day to complete\nthis review, the water reminders were a godsend.\nOther than minigames\nyou also have the option to\ndo challenges, where you\ndo one basic exercise such\nas pulling or squeezing the\n\u201cWhere the\ngame shines\nthough, is in its\nstory mode.\u201d\n\u201cEach exercise\nis grouped\ninto 1 of 4\ntypes: Core,\nArms, Legs and\nYoga.\u201d\nring-con as many times as\npossible in 20 seconds.\nYou can compare your\nscores with friends and\nis very enjoyable when\nyou don\u2019t have enough\ntime for a full work-out.\nIf you have even LESS\ntime, there is a great\noption to play while doing\nsomething else\u2026 In my\n\u2018breaks\u2019 I watched Netflix\nwhile squeezing the ring\nagainst my shoulder.\nAfter an episode or seven\nof The Good Place, I turn\nthe game back on and\nbehold it measured all\nof my squeezes, telling\nme how many calories I\nburned and giving me a\njob well done!\nWhere the game shines\nthough, is in its story\nmode. You jump in with\na short opening sequence\nthat sets up the story: The\nevil Dragaux (a super\nbuff dragon with gains\nfor days) gets released\nfrom a ring and goes on\nto wreak havoc in the\nneighbouring villages.\nThe ring turns out to be\na sentient being, aptly\nnamed Ring, and together\nwith him, you have to\ntrack Draguax down and\ndefeat him! Not the most\nimaginative story but for\na fitness game I will allow\nit. The gameplay involves\njogging on the spot to run\nforward, doing knee-lifts\nto climb up stairs and\nsqueezing or pulling Ring\nto shot or suck in air to\ncollect coins. These coins\ncan be spent on clothing\nfor the avatar character.\nThere is a wide variety\nof options, a welcome\naddition given the very\npoor initial character cus-tomisation.\nRunning on the spot\neffectively means that\nthe game is very linear,\nwith only a couple paths\nyou can take in each level\n(almost like a 2.5D plat-former).\nHowever, the main\nreason that this game goes\nbeyond your typical RPG\nis the combat sequences.\nAt some point, you will\nrun into white glowing\nenemies, which will start\nthe fight. The monsters\nare hilarious re-imaging\nof exercise equipment,\nsuch as a crab-like\ndumbbell or anthropomorphic kettlebell. You\nfight in typical RPG style,\nwith various offensive\nmoves doing different\namounts of damaging and\ntargeting 1-5 enemies.\nThe unique aspect is that\neach move is an exercise.\nI never thought I would\nbe doing 26 squats to take\nthe basic enemy down\nto half health but here\nwe are. Each exercise is\ngrouped into 1 of 4 types:\nCore, Arms, Legs and\nYoga. Once you get past\nthe 2nd world even more\nstrategy opens up where\ncertain types of moves\nhurt certain monsters\nmore. This cleverly opens\nup a way of making you\ndo a whole body work out\nif you want to progress\nthrough the levels. I found\nmyself switching from\nan under-arm press to\nchair-pose to knee-lifts\njust so I could survive a\nfight against 3 different\nmonsters.\nI am yet to finish the\ngame but at the moment\nI am loving it. The peripherals are so precise\nthat sometimes I forgot\nI was even exercising. I\nguess that is the true mark\nof a great fitness game.\nPossibly the best part of\nRing Fit Adventure is its\nmassive amount of difficulty variation. It asks you\nThe game is as whacky as it looks here, I can promsie you that // Engadget\nyour sex, height, weight,\nfitness level and how difficult you want the game to\nbe and makes, from what\nI can tell, a bespoke difficulty level that changes\neach exercises rep count\nas well as resistance.\nThis is great as it makes\nsure that you are always\npushing yourself as far as\nyou want. Whether you\nare a complete novice or\na fitness pro you will find\nbenefit from this game,\nit even measures your\ncalories and heart rate at\nthe end of each level to let\nyou know how hard you\nhave been working!\nIf it is not clear already:\nI loved this game. If you\nare interested in getting\nfit but love video games\ntoo much, this is truly an\nexcellent middle ground,\nwith humorous charac-ters, great music, limitless\nreplayability and a good\nworkout to boot! If you\nwere put off by Wii Fit,\nfret not. This beats Wii\nFit by miles and I thought\nvery highly of it. For what\nit was trying to achieve,\nRing Fit Adventure excels\nin every aspect.\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\nPublisher: Nintendo\nDeveloper: Nintendo\nGenre: Fitness\nPlatforms: Switch\nRing Fit Adventure\n\n"

The\nbellies were frozen and set\nA Story of Pork Belly:\neven used pork bellies\nto explain how a market\nworks in a 1983 \ufb01lm titled\n\u201cTrading Places\u201d. (See\nYoutube: Trading Places\n\u2013 Bookies). However, the\nlandscape of the business\nchanged when pork bellies\nwere consumed all year\nround rather than being\na seasonal product. With\nbacon accompanying\nsalads, hamburgers, and\neven milkshakes (think\nFive Guy\u2019s free bacon\ntopping), it removed the\ndemand for frozen bellies.\nIn 2011, trading pork belly\nfutures came to an end on\nthe Chicago Mercantile\nExchange (CME) \u2013 it was\nnot a shock as the volume\nof trades had shrunk to\nalmost nothing.\nHowever, bacon is back\non the menu this year!\nWhy? McDonald\u2019s\nreported a 4.5% increase\nin comparable store sales\nin the \ufb01rst quarter in part\ndue to bacon-related\npromotions such as \u201cBig\nMac Bacon\u201d and \u201cQuarter\nPounder Bacon\u201d.

Commodities\nare split into two types:\nhard and soft commodi-ties.\nHard commodities\nare typically natural\nresources that must be\nmined or extracted such\nas gold and oil; whereas\nsoft commodities are\nagricultural products or\nlivestock such as corn,\nwheat, soybeans and\npork bellies.\nTrading commodities\nhave been a long-running\nbusiness \u2013 from seashells\nor indirectly, simply\nbecause of the shipment\nof products (from where\nit is manufactured to the\nshelves). Furthermore,\noil price is always a\ndiscussion point between\npoliticians.\nIn addition, commodities are often the most\nsigni\ufb01cant exports of developing countries, and\nrevenues obtained from\nthem have an important\neffect on the economies\nand living standards\nin these countries. For\nexample, many countries\nin Africa derive more\nthan 90% of their export\nearnings from commodi-ties.\nHow does commodities\nmarket work?\nInvestors can gain\nexposure to commodities\nindirectly by investing\nin companies that rely\non commodity prices\nor through the purchase\nof mutual funds. Direct\nexposure to commodities\nwould be buying into a\nfutures contract. This is\nknown as paper trading.\nCommodities can also be\ntraded physically \u2013 companies secure a supply\nof commodities from\nend-producers and help\nForecast\u201d based on\nfeedback from 700 professional chefs. Spurred\nby the growing popularity and the price volatility\nas seen in Figure 1, in\nMay 2019 CME began\nto publish a new Fresh\nBacon Index to provide\na transparent weekly\nprice to those across the\nbacon supply chain, for a\nbetter understanding on\nthe market dynamics of\nbacon that is sold in the\ncash market.\nYou may wonder why\nthe wholesale prices of\npork bellies \ufb02uctuate\nso much? Think about\nthe supply chain and the\nwider economic factors:\nUS-China trade war and\nthe pig-disease outbreak,\nFigure 1. The increasing demand for pork belly has led to large gyrations in prices // Bloomberg\n\u201c...the pork\nthat comes\nfrom the belly\nof a pig,\nwas an iconic\ncommodity\nfor the futures\nmarket\u2019s\nrepresentation\nin popculture\u201d\naside, then used to make\nbacon during the summers\nwhen the demand for it\nto market them across the\ngeographies to a wholesaler or end-user.\nThey add value to the\nsupply chain through\ntheir unique know-how\nin the \ufb01eld of transpor-tation, \ufb01nancing and risk\nhedging.\nSomething interesting\nto think about. The\ncommodities market is\n(think BLT sandwiches)\nrose. Therefore, consumers hedged against in\ufb02ation by locking the price\nof the belly through the\nuse of a futures contract\n(a contract for assets\nbought at agreed prices\nbut delivered and paid for\nlater). Pork belly futures\nreached its peak of popularity in the early 1980s.\nIt became well-known\nto the general public\nafter being referenced in\nmagazines and movies \u2013\nEddie Murphy\u2019s character\n\u201cYou may\nwonder why\nthe wholesale\nprices of\npork bellies\nfluctuate so\nmuch?\u201d\nto spices, the ancient civilisations saw the ability\nto create and manage\ncomplex trading systems\nand facilitate commodity\nexchange as a form of\neconomic development.\nThroughout the years,\nthe basic economic\nprinciples of supply and\ndemand behind trading\ncommodities have not\nchanged: disruptions in\nthe supply chain, such\nas livestock-related\ndiseases, is likely to lead\nto a spike in the usually\nstable and predictable\ndemand; technological\nadvances also often have\nsigni\ufb01cant in\ufb02uences on\nprices.\nWhat makes commodities trading interesting is\nits strong connection with\nthe economic landscape.\nOften it is described as\nthe \u201cinvisible hand\u201d that\nmoves the market. The\nmost straightforward\nexample is oil \u2013 many\nconsumers only think\nabout oil prices in the\ncontext of how it directly\nimpacts their wallets; in\nother words, how much\nthey will end up paying\nat the pump as the result\nof price \ufb02uctuations.\nHowever, the price of\noil can potentially affect\nmany companies, directly\n\u201cThink about\nthe supply\nchain and\nthe economic\nfactors: USChina trade\nwar and the\npig-disease\noutbreak\u201d\nOverview of the commodities market\ncomplex, and it involves\nmany players.

Ng is the kind\nof writer who has keen\neyes for one\u2019s deepest\nand darkest desires, and\nyou can feel every character\u2019s flesh and blood as\nif you\u2019re living their life\nas them. She chooses the\ntell the narrative through\na third-person omniscient point of view, and\nalthough she often skips\naround from character to\ncharacter, the story still\nflows and never feels out\nof place at any point. One\nmay frame the story as\nthe identity crisis of an\nAsian-American, but I\nthink it\u2019s more of a vessel\nNg utilises for us to see a\nbigger picture.\nThe story began with\nthe sudden disappearance\nof Lydia Lee, the beloved\ndaughter of James and\nMarilyn Lee. James came\nfrom a family of Chinese\nimmigrants, and despite\nbeing born and raised in\nthe States, struggled to\nfit into American society.\nMarilyn was an aspiring\ndoctor who had wanted\nanything but her mother\u2019s\nvision of her being the\nperfect housewife.

Thus begins the story\nof the two and their three\nchildren.\nWe see through the eyes\nof each sibling as well as\nhow Lydia\u2019s death affects\neach family member. We\nsee James seeking comfort\nby having an affair; we\nsee Marilyn trapped in\nimmense guilt. We see\nhow Nath recalls the other\nside of Lydia, the one who\ncraves just a little bit of\nlove and comfort; we see\nHannah sees past Lydia\u2019s\nsmile that doesn\u2019t reach\nthe eyes.\nPiece by piece, it eventually became clear that\nLydia had drowned in the\nlake, and the plot unraveled slowly as we learned\nhow one expectation after\nanother piled up on Lydia,\nwith James projecting his\nsocial insecurities onto her\nand Marilyn forcing her\nonto the path of science.\nThere\u2019s very little left she\nlooked forward to, and in\nher quest for an answer,\nshe returned to what she\ndeemed the beginning of\nher unhappy childhood\nand found her ending\nthere in the lake.\nI could not pinpoint\nwhy exactly I resonated\nwith the story, just like I\ncould not pinpoint what\nexactly the story is about.\nIt\u2019s a subtle, quiet family\nAnother masterpiece by Celeste Ng featuring a family drama surrounding the suspicious death of a young girl.\nCeleste Ng // PBS News Hour\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 25TH OCTOBER, 2019\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n24\n\u201cNg has keen\neyes for ine\u2019s\ndeepest\nand darkest\ndesires\u201d\n\u201cAn unsettling\njourney that\nforces me to\nredefine family\nand sacrifice\nand empathy\u201d\ndrama where each character came alive with Ng\u2019s\nwriting.

Orbiting between\ntwo stars, Solaris defies\nscientific explanation, behaving not as a planet but\nmore like a living being.\nThe book is about the\nfutility of humans trying\nto communicate with or\nunderstand alien beings.\nThe main drama of\nthe novel comes in the\nform of the \u2018visitors\u2019,\nhaunting doppelg\u00e4ngers\ndrawn from the minds\nof the researchers that\nseem to originate from\nSolaris itself. In the case\nof the main character,\nKris Kelvin, a former\nlover appears, torturing\ndifferent beast. Stripping\nout a lot of the book\u2019s\nambiguity, the play\nreaches to the heart of\nwhat Lem was aiming for\nwhile also updating it for\na modern audience. What\nwas previously all very\nhigh-concept becomes\nmore accessible, without\ncompromising on the\noriginal vision.\nIn the novel the characters are hidden away, deep\nin the psychological hell\ncaused by their visitor.The\nplay brings the crew (all,\nbar Snow, gender flipped)\nout of their rooms to argue\nabout the proper way to\nrespond to the nonsensical\nconstructs that Solaris has\nsent them. While this may\nbe a theatrical necessity\nto avoid long expositional\nmonologues, it does give\nthe characters a chance\nto voice the hopes and\nfears that the planet, and\nthe thought of wider alien\ncontact, inspire in them.\nBy making Kris\u2019 (Polly\nFrame) visitor the most\nadvanced, Dr Sartorius\n(Jade Ogugua) and Dr\nSnow (Fode Simbo)\nbecome the voices of\nhumanity, shut out of\nthe cabin where Kris\nsequesters herself with\nRay (Keegan Joyce). The\ntwo colleagues are free to\nworry about what it would\nactually mean to make\ncontact with a truly alien\nintelligence. Through this\ndialogue, the story, once\nregarded as Freudian\nand anticommunist,\nchallenges the arrogance\nthat inspired efforts to\ncommunicate with the\nplanet. While possibly the\nclunkiest of the scenes, its\nearnest message reaches\nfar beyond the words that\ncarry it.\nThe setting of the\nnarrative lends itself to\ninteresting set design with\na clean white spaceship\ninterior, parts of which\nslide away to reveal beds,\ncabin doors, and cassette\nplayers. Charmingly\nanalogue, the play has its\nastronauts research in the\nlibrary and smoke cigars.\nWhile it could easily be\ndismissed as quaint, and is\nintentionally anachronis-tic, the effect is to create\na chimera that has been\nleft behind in time. The\nstation and the scientists\non it have dedicated years\nto studying a being that\nhas no interest in them\nand may in fact only be\ndreaming.\nIt is in the third quarter\nthat the play falters.\nThe planet, no longer\nways. One scene, in which\nKris\u2019 visitor is on stage\nalone, seems to commit\nthis version of \u2018Solaris\u2019\nto one very specific interpretation of the story.\nThough a twist towards\nthe end challenges this\ninterpretation, the damage\nis already done.\nIn the end, the tender\nmoments between Kris\nand Ray stop the play\nfrom becoming overly\ncerebral, by grounding\nit in Kris\u2019 pain and hope,\nand in Ray\u2019s horror at discovering his true nature.\nBy developing a simpler\nromp out of a hugely\ncomplicated text, Greig\nand his director Matthew\nLutton have created something worth seeing.\nDon\u2019t Solar-miss this futuristic alien drama!\nCabin fever is bad enough without the arrival of alien doppelg\u00e4ngers // Mihaela Bodlovic\nhim with guilt over her\nsuicide.

The use of visual\nstimulus to push a sense of\nachievement onto players\nis longstanding, with slot\nmachines\u2019tinny music and\n\ufb02ashing lights being the\neasiest example to-hand.\nMMORPGs like World\nof Warcraft also tapped\ninto this early \u2013 levelling\nup was accompanied by\na \ufb02ash of golden light.\nThis doesn\u2019t even touch\non extra features such as\n\u201csuper likes\u201d or \u201cboosts\u201d\n\u2013 mechanics that have\ndeliberately limited avail-ability, instilling in them\nrarity and a sense of status\nto receiving them.\nThe stroke of genius in\nTinder\u2019s design, however,\nis that it allows users to\nde\ufb01ne their own \u2018win condition\u2019. While a traditional game has clear goals\n\u2013 such as levelling up \u2013\nTinder broadens its appeal\nby allowing for more\ndynamic interactions.\nUsers are able to seek\ndifferent conditions to tap\ntheir emotional reward\ncentre, depending on their\npreferences. Some seek\nreward in the number of\nmatches they receive,\nnever actually holding\na conversation or going\non a date; others by how\nmany dates or hook-ups\nthey can secure; others by\nengaging in meaningful\nconversations; and still\nmore by \ufb01nding love.\nThese design aspects\n\u2013 among many others \u2013\nhave catapulted Tinder\nahead of other dating\napps.

    "content": "FRIDAY, 25TH\nOCTOBER, 2019 FELIX\n4\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNEWS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nT\nhe College has\nexpanded the\nspace available\nto the Student\nCounselling and Mental\nHealth Advice Service,\nby renovating space\nin the old unoccupied\nBernard Sunley hall in\nEvelyn Gardens. The\nnew space opened on\n7th October.\nThe budget for the\nexpansion was around\n\u00a3150,000, which was used\nto convert and furnish five\nrooms in the building into\ncounselling spaces \u2013 as\nwell as a reception and a\nwaiting room for students,\na necessity which had\nbeen missing at the service\u2019s South Kensington\nlocation in the Sherfield\nBuilding.\nThe new rooms will\nbe used by three full-time counsellors hired\nby the service last year,\nfor whom there was\njob \u2013 previously, we were\noffered resources but not\nthe space, so we couldn\u2019t\ngive a meaningful offering from that.\u201d\nRosie Summerhayes,\nthe head of the service,\nsaid that the goal has\nalways been to see students within 7-10 working\ndays of referral \u2013 but that\nthe lack of space has made\nthat impossible, with the\naverage wait time climbing from 8.2 working days\nin 2014-15 to 23.0 days in\n2018-19.\nAlongside the expan-sion, the service is also\ntrialling a new system\nfor conducting the first\nassessment; we want to\nencourage students to start\na conversation about what\nis troubling them and be\nheard, and then we can\nsuggest the right support\nfor them.\u201d\nThe new system has\nreceived positive feedback so far, with students\nreportedly preferring to be\nseen quicker to develop an\ninitial action plan than to\nwait for a longer session\n\u2013 but it will be assessed\nthroughout the year based\non student feedback.\nShervin Sabeghi,\nthe Deputy President\n(Welfare) of the Union,\nwas involved in hiring the\nnew counsellors over the\nsummer. He commented\nthat he is \u201cconfident that it\nwill result in far fewer students getting stuck in the\nsystem and not receiving\nthe support they need.\u201d\n\u201cI plan to keep up-to-date with how these\nchanges affect waiting\ntimes and the student experience with the service\nthroughout the year \u2013 so\nit\u2019s important for students\nto give feedback.\u201d\nThe space has been\npraised as being a major\nimprovement, by Shervin\nas well as the counsellors.\nAlthough concerns have\nbeen raised about the distance to Evelyn Gardens \u2013\na 20 minute walk from the\nSouth Kensington campus\n\u2013 Rosie believes this can\nbe a positive.\n\u201cIt gives students time\nto think about what they\nwant to talk about on the\nway here, and time to\ndecompress on their way\nback. Counselling is not\nalways a joyous experience \u2013 it can be upsetting\nor disturbing. You need\nspace between yourself\nand the rest of the world.\u201d\nAsimilar benefit is offered\nby the new waiting room.\nShe feels that this is\nemphasised when considering other wellbeing\nprovisions, such as in\ndepartments: \u201cyou can\u2019t\njust flip back to being a\nfunctioning student upon\nopening the door. You\nneed to go to a different\nspace, talk about it, and\nthen you leave it behind\n\u2013 rather than it being\ncontained in your department.\u201d\nThere is an essential\nimportance to the feeling\nand particularly the\nentrance to a counselling\nbuilding. Both Rosie and\nClaire stressed the need\nfor it to be discrete, safe,\nand professional \u2013 for\nstudents to feel like they\ncan share freely and to\nfeel able to contain any\nproblems they have to that\nspace. This was, in fact,\nthe primary consideration\nwhen new venues were\nbeing considered over the\npast several years \u2013 both\nin South Kensington and\nat other campuses such as\nWhite City or Hammersmith Hospital.\nThe new space caters\nwell to this, being placed\noff-site. There are,\nhowever, downsides \u2013\nother than the distance,\nwhich may become a\nproblem during exam\ntime. The budget for the\nrenovation ran out before\nall available rooms could\nbe refitted, meaning that\nthere are several available\nrooms which are still\nempty. This is despite the\nfact that the old hall has\nbeen vacant for four years.\nThis leaves a lot of\nroom for future expansion,\nwhich is useful as Rosie\nforesees the need for\neventual growth to twelve\ncounsellors in order to\ntackle the load during the\nbusiest times of year.\nYear on year, there is\nincremental growth on\nthe number of students\nutilising counselling \u2013\ngrowth far above that of\nthe overall student pop-ulation. The number of\nstudents confirming and\nattending appointments\nhas risen by anywhere\nfrom 11% to 22.1% each\nsuccessive year for a total\nincrease of 76.2% since\n2014-15, as compared\nto a total student population growth of 19.2%\nin the same time frame.\nAlready, the service feels\nthat it is \u201coutgrowing\u201d\nthe space, as there is an\nevident need to expand\nthe Mental Health Advice\nteam. However, the transient nature of the student\npopulace poses challenges\nin this regard.\n\u201cOctober to November\nand January through\nCollege Counselling Service Expansion: A First Step\nThe College has invested into expanding the student counselling service after they had struggled to keep up with\ndemand for several years - but this is just the beginning\n\u201cThe average\nwaiting time\nfor a meeting\nat the service\nincreased from\n8.2 working\ndaysin 2014-15 to 23.0 in\n2018-19\u201d\nmeeting with students,\ndubbed the \u2018initial conversation\u2019. By cutting the\nlength of these meetings\nto 30 minutes instead of\n50, while still ensuring\nthe initial conversations\ntake place with an experienced counsellor, students\nare now being seen much\nearlier than they previously would have.\nClaire expanded on\nthis: \u201cI am sure that any of\nus would be glad to have\nan initial conversation\nwith a specialist \u2013 it\u2019s\nmuch better than waiting\nseveral weeks only to find\nthat counselling isn't the\nright solution. It\u2019s a triage\n\u201cThis is just\nthe space we\nneed to simply\ndo our job -previously,\nwe were given\nresources but\nnot space\"\npreviously no available\nspace in Sherfield \u2013 bringing the total up to 9.6\nfull-time equivalent staff.\nAs Claire Fox, the Senior\nStudent Counsellor, put\nit: \u201cthis is just the space\nwe need to simply do our\n\u201cThe number\nof students\nconfirming\nand attending\nappointments\nrose a total of\n76.2% since\n2014-15\u201d\nThere is still abandoned space, as budget ran out before renovating fully\n// Henry Alman\n\n"

When\nlooking at myself I\u2019ve\ndetermined that I\u2019m\nsome part sympathetic/\nemotional and can be ridiculously compassionate\n(I was welling up after researching what happened\nduring the UoL 2013\nProtests https://www.\nchannel4.com/news/\nuniversity-of-london-stu-dent-protest-ban-sen-ate-house-occupy), but I\nalso have a ridiculously\ncold logical side. Overall,\nI\u2019m quick to judge but fortunately quicker to change\nmy opinion when it\u2019s clear\nsomeone is worth their\nsalt.\nI think that University\nis really an abusive lesson\nin resilience. You gotta be\nthere for yourself and help\nyourself. Imagine you\u2019re\non a plane (Oh boy I love\nrunning gags) and the\noxygen masks fall down in\na crisis \u2013 you are told and\nprobably will strap yours\non \ufb01rst. You\u2019ve got to\nhelp yourself \ufb01rst before\nhelping others. If you\nbecome an incapacitated\nwreck then what good\nare you to your friends\n- the same applies here.\nAn ex-MechEng legend\nwho failed \ufb01rst-year\nmechanics like 5 times\nonce told me: \u201cI gotta stay\n\ufb01t and mentally robust,\notherwise I\u2019m deadwood\nto my friends when they\nneed me\u201d.\nAnother thing that\nnarks me is some students\u2019\nfundamentalist mentality\nof \u201cA mental breakdown\nproves you\u2019re trying hard\nenough\u201d being modern\nprofessionalism alongside\nthe seeming abundance of\nintolerance at Uni\u2026 And\nI\u2019m certainly not the most\ntolerant person. People\nmake mistakes, every\nday. Boy, you should\nhave seen the typo_s that\nwere in this, or how hard\nI shafted 2nd-year exams.\nBut people are not forgiving enough for the small\nbenign typos of an email,\nor speech, and rush to take\noffence.\nModern professionalism seems \ufb01xated on\nhow to react, and act differently around different\npeople. Again, I\u2019m a bit\nshite at this, as the Provost\nfound out when I called\nhim out the same as I\nwould anyone else. I don\u2019t\nreally believe in changing\nthe way I talk depending\non the environment/ who\nI\u2019m talking to - a toddler,\na fresher, a good friend\nor even Alice Gast. Why\nchange the way I am, I\nvalue authenticity and\n\u201cknowing thyself\u201d far\nmore. Another bugbear on\nprofessionalism, to me it\nmeans not holding petty\ngrudges when someone\nforgot to say please or\nwas sharp on an email,\nrealising instead that they\nhave their own shit to\ndeal with and getting on\nwith it. Impersonally and\nef\ufb01ciently, they would be\nthe loveliest person over\ncoffee maybe but they\nhave stuff to do. Sadly for\nsome people they can\u2019t\nseem to put little things\naside and (with my rather\nblunt northern emails) \ufb01nd\nmyself repeatedly at the\nbad end of sticks - despite\nthe fact that I am lovely\nover coffee in a personal\nsetting. Just in the of\ufb01ce\nI\u2019m Mr multitasker. It is\nhowever saddening that\nin our modern age there\nis the increased potential\nfor misunderstanding and\ncrossed wires in an email\n(With 80% of those \u201call\ncomms\u201d that are visual\ndisappearing)\nPerhaps I\u2019m being\nmarginally dismissive in\ngeneral, I just hope that\nthere are people out there\nwho want to read this kind\nof mind-based bullshit\nwhich comes with heavily\nbiased advice from a\nreal person. Not totally\nunhinged but real. I started\noff this piece roughly\nwith some talk of mental\nwellbeing and psyche, and\nit\u2019s true; people talk to me\nalmost every day about\nworries and problems \u2013 do\nI offer something? I don\u2019t\nknow. But I try to listen\nwhere I can, reassuring\nthem that there is great\nvalue in talking, because\nthere is. And it\u2019s not even\nabout sharing something\nof myself with them - it\u2019s\nabout understanding.\nUnderstanding is one\nof the greatest things we\nhave as a species. And\nbeing honest and open\ntoo. This is why above\nall else I value straight-forward, down to earth\ntalk. Honest talk. \u2013 I hate\ncorporate-speak, such\nas talk of \u201cmanaging\nexpectations\u201d or \u201cstarting\nconversations\u201d. As one of\nmy committee pointed out\nafter CSPB (Clubs Societies & Projects Board) that\nkinda stuff is for \u201cGoons\nin a room\u201d who never get\nstuff done.\nNaturally, it\u2019s easy to\noppose, challenging to be\nin power, and hard to \ufb01x\nstuff. Which makes my\ncriticisms of the system,\nwhich I\u2019ve tried to lay off\nthis week, easy to level.\nBut hell, we are trying\nto put forward solutions.\nAnd we will keep trying.\nAccountability is the\nstalwart position of an\nengineer. You sign off\nthe plant, car, program\netc with your mark - and\nare responsible for and\nanswerable for what you\ndo. In this way I hope\nthat you\u2019ll always view\nus as being too. Humans\nare more questions than\nanswers. But please if\nyou have anything you\nwant to ask, then ask\nme ask me ask me! My\ncommittee, like me, are a\ncurious bunch of weirdos\nand spend time thinking\n\u2013 trying to make sense of\nthings. So why not pop by\nCAGB 350 whenever you\ngot a question and ponder\nwith us. We\u2019re always\nopen when the light\u2019s on.\nI\u2019m going to close\nagain with parting words\nof wisdom from my\n\ufb02atmate, commenting\nthat life isn\u2019t all that bad\nnow for teenagers \u201cWhen\nour parents were younger\nthe music was better, and\nyou could buy a house,\neverything else was bit\nshite tbf.\u201d\n2\n2:19 on a Monday,\n12 Hours of\nLectures behind\n(Sadly impres-sive). Bev of choice while\ncomposing this master-piece: Thatchers Gold.\nBy the time this all\ngets printed \u2013 if the copy\neditors or ICU staff don\u2019t\nmerk me - it\u2019ll be the\nend of a blissfully hellish\nweek, I\u2019ll have designed a\njet plane (yay!), survived\nanother week of daily\nemails and will be looking\nforward to dining with\nsome of you at our Annual\nWelcome Dinner on\nSaturday (26th).\nIt\u2019s been another inter-estingweekfortheCGCU,\nwith the highlight thus\nfar being last week\u2019s Pub\ncrawl. I\u2019m slowly getting\nmy life together having\nsuccessfully cooked three\nsquare meals on Monday,\nwhich was navally appropriate given that it\nwas Trafalgar Day. The\nnext step is getting back\ninto the gym #BigLAD.\nNow onto the deep shite.\nI think with this week\u2019s\nramblings I am getting\nat something, topics or\nthings you don\u2019t really\ndiscuss outside of therapy\nor a late-night DMC with\nyour best mate. University\nis a period of life in which\na lot of things happen,\nsome good, some bad,\nregardless they all shape\nyour character to a greater\nor lesser extent. The sum\nof my experience so far is\nthat I am in a better place\nnow than I was previously,\ndespite the various shitty\naspects of the past couples\nof years and the scars they\nB e y o n d\nConversation:\nSoon they\u2019ll\nregret giving me\nthis column.

Their\nsinging was truly beauti-ful, and at times haunting.\nNhlanhla Mahlangu was\nthe music director who\ncomposed this interpretation of Bol\u00e9ro that this\nSouth African a cappella\nquartet sung.\nI\u2019m no expert when it\ncomes to dance, but the\nintensity and dexterity,\nthe changes from fast\nand energetic to slow and\nlamenting, the control and\nrhythm, dancing individually and then as one form\n\u2013 it was extraordinary.\nIn particular, Maqoma\u2019s\nsolos were masterful. As\nsoon as the dancers start\nmoving, you\u2019re completely entranced. I never\nthought I could sit still and\nwatch people move like\nthis, with no words, for 70\nminutes straight, but the\ntime flew so quickly \u2013 it\nfelt like you were being\nhypnotised.\nSet in a graveyard, the\npiece takes you through\na journey of emotions\nthat come with death in\na modern world where\n\u201cwe have all become\nprofessional mourners\u201d,\naccording to Maqoma.\nThis show will keep\nyour brain ticking for\nhours after it\u2019s over, and\nthe subject matter was\nso relevant to this day\nand age. Unfortunately,\nthe show was only at the\nBarbican for a few days,\nbut the show encouraged\nme to expand my horizons\nwhen it comes to the arts.\nI\u2019d recommend you look\nout for the next Vuyani\nDance Theatre piece!\nM\ni c h i e l e t t o\nr e w o r k s\nDonizetti\u2019s\nc l a s s i c\ncomedy, Don Pasquale\n(Dom Pa-Skwah-Lay), at\nthe Royal Opera House.\nThe opera buffa stays true\nto its origins with a largely untouched storyline\nbut successfully brings its\ncharacters into 2019. The\nresult is fabulous: think\ntraditional opera singing,\nbut the song is about\ndiscovering shady messages on your partner\u2019s\niPhone. Don Pasquale\nwas an instant success\nwhen first performed in\nParis in 1843 and judging\nby the copious laughter\non opening night, this\nrevamp has been met with\nequal enthusiasm.\nDon Pasquale\u2019s\ndramatic storyline is\nresonant of an episode\nof MTV\u2019s Catfish with\nthe aged and tyrannical\nDon Pasquale giddily\nmarrying his dream bride,\nthe beautiful convent girl\nNorina. Within seconds of\nthe diamond ring slipping\nonto her finger Pasquale\nlearns that what you see\nisn\u2019t always what you get.\nFar from his smooth-sail-ing \u2018happily ever after\u2019,\nan artfully constructed\ntale unfolds \u2013 brimming\nwith hilarious antics and\nscheming \u2013 all at the\nexpense of poor Pasquale.\nAs the characters grow\nmore evil, the humour\ngains a darker, almost\nsadistic tone. Regardless,\nDon Pasquale is undeniably funny \u2013 I\u2019ll guarantee\nyou\u2019ll laugh out loud.\nOpera heavyweight\nBryn Terfel offers a\ntouching lead performance as Don Pasquale\nby bringing a delicate\nvulnerability to an otherwise despicable character.\nOlga Peretyatko dazzles\nas the bewitching Norina\nwith glorious vocals and\nexceptional comedic\ndelivery. One should\nnote the show is entirely\nin Italian and that the\nsubtitles (neck-breakingly\ndisplayed at the very top\nof the stage) are often\nincomplete or confusing.\nDespite this, the cast\u2019s\nexpressive performance\nand Evelino Pido\u2019s\nsuperb conducting craft\na captivating atmosphere\nto compensate for the\noccasional lack of under-standing.\nPaolo Fantin spares\nno expense when constructing his dynamic set:\nwith a sports car wheeled\non stage, hilarious use\nof a green screen and\na house rotating on a\nplatform. However, while\nFantin\u2019s ambition must\nbe applauded, a lack of\nattention to transitions\nbecame disappointingly\napparent. Crumpled paper\nairplanes thrown within\nthe first five minutes of the\nperformance sat strewn on\nthe stage for the rest of the\nopera. Puppets needed for\na later scene were callously placed at the front of the\nstage, waiting to be picked\nup. In addition, Fantin\u2019s\nuse of props swings from\nminimalist to overly\ndetailed throughout the\nshow. Certain mundane\nconversations were staged\nbeautifully, while other\npivotal fights took place\nin poorly defined spaces\non the side of an old set.\nOverall, while admittedly remaining visually\nstriking and achieving its\ndesired comic effect, the\nstage was occasionally\nleft feeling either cluttered\nor incomplete.\nWhile far from a conventional student activity,\nDon Pasquale offers a\nfresh avenue to anyone interested in exploring a new\nformat of entertainment.\nWith modern staging and\na dramatic storyline, the\nperformance is a fantastic\nhybrid of traditional opera\nand modern performance.\nGeology students are as satisfied as Sade // Wikimedia\nFELIX\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nShivani Gangadia\nArts Writer\nGregory Maqoma leads Vuyani Dance Theatre in an inspired performance that intermingles South African\nDon Pasquale: A modern opera\nA modernized rendition of an opera classic: Don Pasquale, is a hysterical and, at times, sadistically cruel comedy\nARTS\nMehreen Ishaque\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "Foundations of Hip Hop: The Memphis Underground\n\u201c...created\ndreamlike\nsoundscapes\nthat would\nserve as the\nbasis for the\nSoundCloud\nand mumble\nrap artists that\nfollowed.\u201d\n\u201cThe Memphis\nscene has\ntaught us\nthat what\u2019s\nconsidered\nunderground\nis dependent\non time and\nlocation.\u201d\nM\nemphis hip\nhop emerged\nfrom the\nunderbelly\nof Memphis, Tennessee\nin the early 90s. While\nthe genre was distinctly\nunderground, it has pervaded through decades\nof hip hop that followed.\nCharacterised by dark lo-fi\nproduction, triplet flows,\nand repetitive hooks, the\nsubject matter consisted\nmainly of street tales from\nMemphis ghettos with\noccasional references\nto the occult. Samples\nfrom horror movies and\nsoul drum beats were the\nfinishing touches to the\nhypnotic music you find\nin the cassette tapes of the\nera.\nThe short choruses and\nminimal synth melodies\nthat were commonplace\nin the region went on to\nshape much of the future\nAmerican club scene.\nThree 6 Mafia, the most\nfamous artists of the\noriginal Memphis cohort,\nbirthed the crunk sound\nthat was later expanded\non by other artists in the\nSouth. Over the next 15\nyears, trap would evolve\nout of crunk, but it wasn\u2019t\nuntil it re-acquired some\nelements of the Memphis\nsound again - for example,\nthetripletflowpopularised\nby the Migos originated in\nMemphis - that it filtered\ninto the mainstream and\nbegan dominating the\ncharts. And artists are\naware of this. Recent hits\nlike \u201cLook Alive\u201d and\n\u201cPowerglide\u201d pay direct\nhomage to the originals.\nOutside of the South,\nChicago had started to\ndevelop its own sound\n\u2013 drill music. And while\ndrill was mainly built\noff trap with the help of\npeople like Waka Flocka\nFlame and Lex Luger,\nMemphis managed to\ntrickle in again. Chief\nKeef\u2019s breakout hit, \u201cLove\nSosa\u201d, that transported\ndrill across international\nwaters, uses a flow from\nthe Three 6 Mafia song\n\u201cStomp\u201d. Drill rappers\ndon\u2019t worry about metaphors and other lyrical\ntropes, instead focussing\non gritty violent lyrics\nakin to those from the\nMemphis era. Both cities\nshare heavy poverty and\nrife gang culture that\ncombined to produce\ncaptivating music rooted\nin realism.\nAnd this DIY ethos\nin the scene wasn\u2019t a\nconscious stylistic choice\nbut, rather, a reflection\nof the area\u2019s reality. The\ndistinctive drums (like\nthe 808 cowbell) resulted\nfrom producers being\nforced to experiment\nwithin the limitations of\ncheap drum machines.\nProducers would use\nthe same samples and\nsometimes sample each\nother\u2019s music, creating a\nvery recognisable sound.\nMost artists would have to\nmake hand-drawn flyers\nand try to sell their tapes\nat the local record shops.\nThey didn\u2019t care so much\nfor lyricism as they did for\nstyle and atmosphere, and\nthis focus on aesthetics\nis integral to many of the\nhip hop subgenres that\nfollowed in the 2000s\nonwards.\nThe influence is especially prominent in the\ninternet genres that grew\nout of the late 2000s like\ncloud rap and phonk.\nCloud rap is one of the\nbiggest subgenres that\ntook clear inspiration\nfrom Memphis\u2019 focus on\natmosphere and mood.\nMany of its biggest propo-nents, like Clams Casino\nand Sad Boys, created\ndreamlike soundscapes\nthat would serve as the\nbasis for the SoundCloud\nand mumble rap artists\nthat followed. In many of\nthese genres, the focus on\nmusic is as important as\nthe visuals - cloud rap and\nanother microgenre called\nvaporwave both have\nartwork that takes inspiration from the layout and\nsymmetry of Memphis\nalbum covers.\nPhonk was popularised by one of the most\nimportant underground\nproducers in hip hop,\nSpaceGhostPurrp (SGP).\nA member of Raider\nKlan, alongside prominent artists like Denzel\nCurry and Xavier Wulf,\nSGP gave his spin on the\nMemphis sound with his\n2012 album Mysterious\nPhonk: Chronicles of\nSpaceGhostPurrp. He also\nworked alongside one of\nthe other main producers\nof 2010s Memphis-style\nhip hop, Lil Ugly Mane\n(LUM). While SGP\u2019s\nwork followed the mould\nof the 90s work, LUM\ntook the production and\nrevamped it for the 2010s.\nHis underground classic,\nMista Thug Isolation,\nis an over-the-top take\non hip hop culture that\nadds emotive synths and\njazzy samples to the core\nsound. Without these two\nproducers and Memphis,\nentire subgenres may not\nhave existed and dozens\nof artists along with that.\nThis musical effect\nbecame more apparent\nwhen an emerging group\nof SoundCloud rappers\nstarted to build up a cult\nfollowing around the\nworld. Suicideboys and\nGhostmane are two from\nthat crop of artists that\npopularised the trap metal\nsound. They hover across\na dark lyrical spectrum\nthat draws on a lot of the\nhorrorcore imagery from\nMemphis, combined with\nideas from heavy metal,\nindustrial, and emo music.\nBoth of these artists sharpened the original Memphis\naesthetic to give it a more\nabrasive edge, combining\nthe drum patterns with\nmore distorted bass and\nvocal aggression.\nLooking outside of\nAmerican hip hop, the\nimpact is still there.\nBritish artists Dizzee\nRascal and Novelist both\npioneered a faster, colder\nform of grime called Ruff\nSound that takes inspiration from the Memphis\nunderground. The drums\nare skippier, and ice-cold\nsynths replace the eerie\npianos, but the sinister\nfeeling of gangs in\nimpoverished inner-city\nestates remains - it\u2019s a\ndistinctly English take on\nthe Memphis sound. Early\nMemphis adlibs and hooks\nstill get sampled frequently in modern music,\noccasionally beyond hip\nhop - alternative pop artist\nBlood Orange has used\nsamples from Memphis\nlegends, Project Pat and\nTommy Wright III, on his\nlast two projects.\nThe Memphis scene\nhas taught us that what\u2019s\nconsidered underground\nis dependent on time and\nlocation. It may not have\nbeen the biggest genre\nwhen it was around, but\nyears later the impact is\nfelt globally. Unfortunately, since this influence is\noften indirect, the scene\ndoesn\u2019t get the acknowledgement it deserves. But\none thing is for certain,\nthe cascading number of\nsubgenres spawned by\nhip hop retain some part\nof the original Memphis\nscene\u2019s DNA, even if they\ndon\u2019t always know it.\nPopular tapes from the era // Various Sources\nISSUE 1731\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\nThe widespread influence of the Memphis underground scene in modern music.\nMUSIC\nAvish\nVijayaraghavan\nMusic Writer\n\n"

Now,\nI wouldn\u2019t want to\nset the bar TOO high but\nFP\u2019s friend Dan Snaith,\na.k.a. Caribou, a.k.a.\nDaphni, has a PhD from\nImperial, as does Brian\nMay. Looking at musicians with doctorates from\nthe most (un?)prestigious\nLondon universities, that\nis an elite crowd. Does\nSam Shepherd stack up?\nI mean, hair-wise he has\nneither the aggressively\nbalding forehead of Snaith\nnor the luscious foliage of\nMay. So what is he then?\nAre his beats any good?\nDoes Imperial\u2019s newspaper rate his new album,\nCrush?\nUnsurprisingly, for\na man whose academic\nbackground is in neuro-science, FP\u2019s music is\nvery cerebral. The beats\nhave a jazzy vibe to\nthem, and despite being\ndense and layered retain\na feet-moving verve.\nThis has always been the\ncase. It is the melodies\nwhich are a departure\non his newest effort. On\nhis previous LP, 2015\u2019s\nElaenia, they were subtle,\ndrawn out, and built up\nover a span of minutes. He\nhad a whole band to round\nout the delicate electronic\nsound: guitars, strings,\npercussion... This time\naround he goes it alone.\nThe first track on the\nalbum immediately links\nus to the symphonic depth\nthat we\u2019re used to hearing\nfrom the nerdy producer\nwho named himself after\nnon-integers. By the\nhalfway point of \u2018Falaise\u2019\nthe flutes, brass, and\nstrings are mingling with\na synth overdosing on\ngrossbeat, and the album\nnever looks back. \u2018Last\nBloom\u2019 picks up with\nsome nice glitchy arpeggios panning from ear to\near, as well as some very\ncrushing beats, but never\ntakes it above second\ngear. The ambient sound\ncontinues in the next\ntrack, \u2018Anasickmodular\u2019,\nafter which another orchestral piece, hilariously\ntitled \u2018Requiem for CS70\nand Strings\u2019, prepares us\nfor the meat of the album.\n\u2018Karakul\u2019, which a\ngoogle search tells me\nis the name of an Uzbek\nsheep breed, acts as the\nbassy platter on which\nthe highlight of the\nalbum is served. The\nmelodically roaming,\nkick-stomping, deep bass\ndriven \u2018LesAlpx\u2019 opens\nwith two elements which\nfollow the entirety of\nthe track. There is the\none-note bassline and, at\nthe end of the phrase, a\nlittle telephone beep of a\nflourish. They are joined\nby a relentless four to the\nfloor and very curt closed\nhats. Finally, some deep-cave-sounding synths pan\nin and out to round out\nthe aura of being a hawk\non an intense flight over\nsome very tall mountains.\nThe best feat of the song\nis the way it completely\nrecedes at the midpoint,\nbefore taking you by the\ncollar and marching you\nto its conclusion.\nThe rest of the album\nthen tunes it down a notch\nagain, with some highlights of the mysterious\nand atmospheric sound\nincluding \u2018Bias\u2019, containing a bass that sounds\nlike it wants to hurt me,\nand \u2018Birth\u2019, which sounds\nlike the synthy cousin of a\nclassical ballroom dance\npiece.\nSo, Mr. biologist, what\ncomes after Birth? Well, it\nall ends with \u2018Apoptose\u2019\nin two parts, the so-called\nprogrammed cell death\n(he can\u2019t help himself\nwith the weird science\nflexing, can he?), placing\nan exquisitely serene\nnightcap on an excellent\nalbum. You might be from\nUCL, but we have to give\nyou this one\u2026\nBig riffs, small ideas: Foals are far too comfortable to\nleave the stadium rock arena\nE\narly this year, following four years\nof relentless\ntouring, Oxfordbased indie quartet, Foals,\nteased that they had a new\nalbum ready. This was\nnot to be any ordinary\nalbum, however, as they\nhad recorded simply too\nmuch material for one\nrecord, meaning it would\nhave to be released in two\neditions, a sonic diptych,\nEverything Not Saved\nWill Be Lost, parts 1 and\n2. Quite why they didn\u2019t\nopt for the conventional\ndouble album format\nwasn\u2019t immediately clear,\nbut it now transpires that\nrather than two sides of\nthe same coin, these two\npieces are thematically\nand musically distinct.\nCompanions for sure, but\nmore Jekyll and Hyde\nthan Ant and Dec.\nPart 1 brought the\nbiggest shift in their sound\nsince the move from the\njangly and staccato Antidotes to the funk-inflected\nintrospection of Total Life\nForever. Synth-laden and\nexpansive, we saw a band\nrevitalised with fresh cre-ativity. It garnered them\na Mercury Prize nomina-tion, and set expectations\nhigh for the sequel. The\nsecond act of their apocalyptic play, however,\nfeels all too familiar.\nRather than continue with\nThis isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s a\nbad album \u2013 far from it\nin fact \u2013 just that the progression from, say, \u2018Snake\nOil\u2019 to \u2018Black Bull\u2019 or \u2018A\nKnife In The Ocean\u2019 to\n\u2018Into the Surf\u2019 feels a bit\ntoo linear. Less of an evo-lution, more a rehashing\nwith added fuzz. There\nare undeniable delights\nthough: in the menacing\nand brooding of \u201810,000\nFeet\u2019 and ten-minute\nclosing jam \u2018Neptune\u2019 we\nsee them deftly navigating\ncavernous soundscapes,\ninterspersed with huge\ncrescendos, and awash\nwith obscure and evocative lyrics. They serve as\na contemplative reprise to\nthe brash and raucous first\nside.\nWith its meaty riffs and\nhowling vocals, Part 2 is\nmade for big, high-octane\nshows.And it makes sense\n\u2013 Foals have, deservedly\nso, earned themselves a\nreputation as one of the\nbest live acts around, as\nanyone who has seen\nthem will attest. While\nthey don\u2019t really go in\nfor onstage theatrics, the\npure unbridled energy of\ntheir performances keeps\nthe crowds flocking back.\nIt\u2019s natural, therefore,\nthat they should seek to\ndistil that dynamism into\nthis record. In this age\nof streaming, touring is\nmore than ever the significant source of income\nfor artists, so you can\u2019t\nblame them. For many\nfans though it\u2019s unfortunate that their new age\nNME-bait stadium rock\ncomes at the expense of\nthe more nuanced, intri-cate, Talking Heads-esque\nquaintness for which they\nwere formally known and\nMaybe it\u2019s better if we don\u2019t save this one // DIY Mag\nMUSIC\nAdrian Lamoury\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Foals Label: Warner/\nTransgressive.

Why, 15\nof Imperial\u2019s \ufb01nest and\nfreshest triathletes, that\u2019s\nwho. On Friday 19th\nOctober, we packed our\nbikes (remembering to\nremove our pedals, don\u2019t\nwant any scratches!) and\nmade the quest to Kent.\nHaving braved the rush\nhour traf\ufb01c of London\non a Friday evening, we\narrived in the converted\nbarn that was to become\nour weekend home, eager\nand ready for a weekend\nof cycling, running and\nswimming.

With copious\namounts of porridge, toast\nand bananas having been\ndevoured, everyone was\nout on their bikes and\ndiscovering the garden\nof England. Splitting into\nthree groups encompassing all from beginners\nto ironman athletes, the\ndistances ranged from 40\nto 70km with no triathlete\nbeing left behind. Chatting\non our bikes and meeting\nnew people, everyone was\nenjoying ignorant bliss,\nunaware of the dangers\n\u201cA compulsory\ncafe stop in\nCanterbury\nwas in order\nwhere we\nwere able to\ninvestigate the\ncakes of Kent.\u201d \u201cSome brave\nathletes\ndecided that\na swim in the\nbracingly cold\nwaters would\nbe a good\nidea.\u201d\nthat lay ahead.

The carrot\ncakes and \ufb02apjacks did\nnot disappoint! Having\nreturned from our bike\nrides, (with the fast group\nreturning after the slow\nsquad), we ventured to the\ncoast where people went\nrunning or walking, or sat\non the beach trying to do\ncoursework enjoying the\nglorious view of the sea.\nSome brave athletes kept\ntrue to the three-sport\nnature of the club and\ndecided that a swim in\nthe bracingly cold waters\nwould be a good idea.\nThis provided great entertainment for the (perhaps\nmore sensible) crew\nremaining on the shore, so\nit was a win all round.\nThe sun was slowly\nsetting, and we returned\nto our house where supper\nwas cooked and an old\ntriathlon triathlon of pass-the-parcel was introduced\nto our new members.\nInstead of a prize at the\nend, the lucky winner\nwas given a variety of\nchallenges, ranging from\nthe physically impressive\nto the downright ridicu-lous.

An anonymous\nsource also claimed that\nseveral players won a\nmatch against UCL while\nshowing symptoms of\nthe infection, and that the\ninfection was then passed\non to UCL footballers\n\u2013 this is currently uncon-firmed.\nAll medics are required\nto receive double doses of\nthe MMR vaccine, which\nprotects against measles,\nmumps, and rubella, prior\nto clinical contact with\nany patient. However, the\nvaccine is only 88% effective according to research\nfrom the US\u2019 Centre for\nDisease Control.\nThough there was\nconcern about missed\ntime on \u2018firms\u2019, or clinical\nplacements, for the affected students, most firms\nare long-term enough\nthat any missed time can\nbe made up \u2013 especially\naccounting for the early\nstarts, late finishes, and\nnight shifts that medics\nare faced with.\nAn email sent from\nthe medicine Faculty\nEducation Office stressed\nto medics the importance\nof notifying Occupational\nHealth as soon as symptoms develop and adhering to the recommended\nrecovery period of five\ndays \u2013 in other words, not\nto perform any clinical\nduties. They must be\ncleared by Occupational\nHealth before being\nallowed to resume those\nduties. Fortunately, the\ndisease is generally only\ninfectious once general\nsymptoms of malaise\nbecome apparent, rather\nthan prior.\nAlmost all patients seen\nby medics are in hospital,\nand are therefore under\n24/7 monitoring. The\nrisk to them is therefore\nminimised \u2013 especially as\nmedics are keenly aware\nof good health and safety\nprocedures. Ben Russell,\nthe ICSMSU President,\nclarified:\n\u201cThere is always\nthe risk of spreading\nany normal infection from\nperson-to-person anyway\nas we are working with\nmany, many patients in\na close environment, but\nthis is counteracted to the\nhighest possible degree by\nthe strict procedures and\nregulations which are in\nplace across the healthcare professions. These\nare constantly reviewed\nand taught to medical\nstudents as well as staff.\u201d\nMedics have taken\nthe outbreak with good\nhumour \u2013 with the netball\nteam setting up a \u2018biohazard zone\u2019 in Reynolds\nduring this week\u2019s Sports\nNight.\nMedics have taken the news with good humour // Eyad Abuelgasim\nMumps Outbreak Amongst Medics\nNEWS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nI\nmperial has\nrenewed a partnership with The\nTimes that gives\nboth students and staff\na free 12-month digital\nsubscription, tied to\ntheir college accounts.\nThe College originally\nstarted the partnership\nlast year, but it was unknown whether it would\ncontinue.\nThe offering has been\nexpanded this year, with\nthe subscription including\nthe Times Literary Supplement as well. College\nmembers will also have\naccess to discounts and\ndeals, as well as event\naccess run by the Times\nPlus scheme.\nIncluded in the deal is\nalso an opportunity for\nstudents to enter a competition in order to write\nfor The Times. Last year,\nthat student budgets\ncannot always afford.\nLuke continued: \u201c\u201cContinuing our partnership\nwith the Times will help\nthe Imperial community\nto decipher and debate\nissues of the day through\naccess to well informed\njournalism.\u201d\nImperial Renews Times Partnership\nFelix\u2019s then Deputy Editor\nand one of the student ambassadors for the first year\nof the scheme, Joanna\nWormald, won a similar\ncontest, granting her\nfour articles across three\nmonths in the well-known\nRed Box column \u2013 a daily\npolitical briefing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity for the budding\njournalists amongst our\nstudents to prove their\nwriting skills on a national\nnewspaper,\u201d said Luke\nBlair, the Vice President\nof Communications and\nPublic Affairs.\nOne aspect that is not\nreturning in full is the\nTimes-sponsored events\nfrom last year. Though\nsome were well-attended,\nothers fell short of the\ndesired goal because of\nscheduling \u2013 with the\nfinal event taking place\nin the middle of the exam\nperiod. The organisation\nof the events was chaotic,\nwith student ambassadors\nreporting feeling confused\nand uncertain on what\nthey were meant to do to\nsupport.

The event\nwas phenomenal, although its position at the\ndistant ExCeL (Royal\nVictoria Dock) was less\nso. While the journey\nto the convention took\nabout an hour, the journey back took two and a\nhalf, courtesy of signal\nissues on the central line.\nPutting my journey woes\naside, the convention held\nsome of the most anticipated upcoming games,\nincluding: Cyberpunk\n2077, Pok\u00e9mon Sword\nand Shield, Final Fantasy\nVII remake and numerous\nother triple-A hits. Not\nto forget the absolute\nonslaught of Indie goodness available to play and\nenjoy: Hollow Knight\nSilk Song, Untitled Goose\nGame and Castle Crashers\nRemastered.\nSo, what did I actually\nmanage to get my hands\non? Whelp, due to my\nlateness as a result\nof commute delays I\ncouldn\u2019t try out as many\ngames as I would have\nliked. With every Triple-A\ngame having a minimum\nof a 30-minute wait,\nAvenger\u2019s was one of the\nworst offenders with a\n2 hour wait queue. With\nwhat limited time I had\nleft I managed to play\nRuneTerra, Dragon Ball\nKakarot and Final Fantasy\nVII remake (the most\ndevastating of queues).\nSo, starting off with\nRuneTerra, the game\u2019s\nvisual aesthetic was on\npoint giving the same\nglitz and glamour as its\nbase material - League of\nLegends. The atmosphere\nand dialogue between\ncards added soul to the\ngame as well as lore and\nimmersion. The gameplay\ndespite being slower than\nmost typical card games\nwas interesting, however,\nit does seem to be a Jack\nof All Trades (master of\nnone) with respect to combining various features\nfrom other card games\ni.e. Magic the Gathering,\nHearthstone. Gameplay\nwas (as you would expect)\nback and forth, every turn\nthe offensive and defensive sides were switched\nalongside every action\nthe player makes, providing their opponent the\nopportunity to use/place\ndown a card. Overall, I\nhave a strong feeling that\nRuneTerra will de\ufb01nitely\nbe able to compete against\nHearthstone; alongside\nRiot\u2019s backing it may\n\u201cRuneTerra\nwill definitely\nbe able to\ncompete\nagainst\nHearthstone\u201d\n\u201cEGX definitely\nhas something\nfor any type of\nGamers\u201d\neven come out on top! I\nalso got the chance to play\nthe Perfect Cell boss \ufb01ght\nin DB Kakarot, which in\nmy opinion was one of the\nbest \ufb01ghts in the Dragon\nBall game series in\nterms of mechanics. My\nreasoning behind this is\nthat the \ufb01ght actually felt\nboth strategic and bullet\nhell-esque whilst retaining\nthe original DB \ufb01ghting\ngame style, with there\nbeing proper boss phases\nas well as interesting\nabilities and movements;\nin other words I cannot\nwait to get my hands\non a copy of the game\npurely for its gameplay!\nFinal Fantasy VII remake\nleft me enamoured by its\nvisuals, it was like I was\nplaying Advent children\nbut in game form, the\ngameplay felt like FFVII\ncombined with FFXIV,\nwhen casting an ability\ntime is slowed drastically\nto the point where it was\nborderline frozen (Za\nWarudo!), limit break is\nstill available, surprisingly they took FFXIII\u2019s\nstaggering mechanic and\nincorporated it into the\ngame. When asking other\npeople how they felt about\nthe movement mechanics,\nthey stated that it felt\nslightly clunky, similar\nto that of Uncharted,\nhere\u2019s hoping that doesn\u2019t\nbecome a point of frustration when playing the\ngame.\nIn terms of indie games\nthe show \ufb02oor was bountiful and amongst it all what\nreally caught my eye was\nthe section dedicated to\nthe new Streets of Rage 4\nas well as Windjammers\n2. Now, these games may\nnot be on everyone\u2019s top\n10 anticipated games\nlist, but for me it\u2019s clear\nthat these games are the\nepitome of the Switch\u2019s\nintention, simple games\nwith greater depth that\nyou would love to pick\nup with a friend whilst\non the go. Windjammers\n2, featured fun gameplay\nwith even more enjoyable\nstrats and tactics, whilst\nStreets of Rage 4\u2019s visual\nappealed to my love of\nside scrolling beat-\u2018emups alongside the ability\nto dish out my pent-up\ncoursework frustration on\nrandom assailants. Other\ngames that I wanted to\nplay included Hollow\nKnight the Silk Song, but\nmy desires were sti\ufb02ed by\nextremely long queues.\nWhilst journeying\nthrough the masses of\ncrowds I also visited the\ntabletop section, which\nwas in my opinion, a\ntable-topper\u2019s dream with\nnumerous games set up\nand free for anyone to sit\ndown, play and have a\nlaugh. As expected of the\narea there were tabletop\nmerchants as well, something I was particularly\nhappy about given that I\nwas able to get the entire\nDark Souls Card Game\ncollection including the\nnew expansion for \u00a350\n- an absolute steal in my\nbook given the price of the\nbase game alone. Other\nareas of the convention\nincluded the \ufb01ght zone,\nwhere a \ufb01ghting competition for Street Fighter V\nwas held, and it de\ufb01nitely\nhad a lot of gusto and\n\ufb01ghting spirit given my\nability to hear the crowd\nshout and cheer from\nacross the room. Retro\nzone was a vintage fan\u2019s\ndream with a massive\nselection of games to\nplay with almost every\nconsole you can imagine\nbeing there, except for the\ncommodore 64 - damn I\nreally wanted to play asteroids on something that\ncan\u2019t even run MSPaint.\nAnd last but not least at\nthe end of my journey I\nsettled down and watched\nsome of the speedrunners,\nthe one I enjoyed the\nmost being Spark The\nElectric Jester 2 played\nby Argick, my heart goes\nout to him for providing\nengaging commentary\nwhilst dealing with some\nbullshit moments in the\nrun. All in all, EGX is\nde\ufb01nitely something for\nGamers of any type, may\nthat be table-toppers, in-die-lovers, retro maniacs\nand of course the Triple-A\nhordes.\nA perfect fusion of retro for the switch // DotEmu\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1731\nFELIX\n8\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Turkish Invasion of Syria\nPOLITICS\nCharlie Titmuss\nComment Editor\nT\nurkey has always\noccupied a\ns t r a t e g i c a l l y\nsignificant place\nin history. As the bastion\nfor the Byzantine Empire,\nas the base for Ottoman\ndominance of the Middle\nEast and as the gateway\nto the Crimea, Turkey has\nalways been a valuable\nprize. More recently,\nTurkey\u2019s membership of\nNATO was a diplomatic\ncoup against the Soviet\nUnion, allowing for the\nplacement of short-range\nnuclear missiles at the\ndoorstep of the Red\nEmpire. With the advent\nof the Syrian Civil War,\nTurkey has become an\never more important regional power player.\nThe Syrian Civil War\nstarted in 2011. It has\nevolved over time into\none of the most brutal\nmodern conflicts, killing\nand disabling thousands\nand creating millions of\nboth externally and internally displaced refugees.\nThe war is multifaceted,\nwith forces loyal to\nBashar Al Assad, Salafist\nIslamist groups, mixed\nArab-Kurdish fighters and\nTurkish backed militias,\nfighting to secure conflicting political goals.\nBashar Al Assad\u2019s forces\nhave received support\nfrom Russian warplanes\nand Iranian militias, the\nSaudis sent funds and\narms to certain Islamist\ngroups, and the US, until\nrecently, supported the\nArab-Kurdish branches\nof the Syrian Democratic\nForces (SDF).\nTwo weeks ago, a\nconflict that had seemed\nto reduce in magnitude\nflared up again, when the\nUS decided to remove its\nbacking for the Syrian\nDemocratic Forces. Subsequently, Turkey decided\nto invade Northern Syria\nand set up an exclusion\nzone.\nTurkey has taken this\ndecision for a variety of\nreasons. The Syrian Democratic Forces is the main\noccupant of the contested\nregion. The SDF\u2019s main\ncomponent is the People\u2019s\nProtection Units (YPG,\na Kurdish abbreviation),\nKurdish militias set up\nto provide protection and\nsecurity in the region\nof Syria following its\nabandonment by Syrian\ngovernment forces. They\nhave proved to be the\nWest\u2019s key ally in the\nfight against Islamic State,\nacting coherently with\nWestern special forces to\ndegrade and ultimately\ndestroy Islamic State.\nHowever, the Kurdish\nidentity of the SDF is\nproblematic for Turkey,\nas they accuse the YPG\nof having links to terrorist\nKurdish organisations.\nKurds are a large minority\nin South Eastern Turkey.\nTerrorist campaigns run\nagainst the Turkish state\nsince the 1970s in the\nname of an independent\nKurdish state have killed\nmany Turkish civilians.\nNaturally, the presence\nof a heavily armed, competent Kurdish force has\ngiven Turkish security\nforces much to worry\nabout over the past several\nyears.\nHowever, there is an\nadditional factor that\nmust be considered - the\nincreasing aggressive\nnationalism present in\nTurkey over the past 20\nyears. Politics in Turkey\nhas had one man at its\ncenter for the last sixteen\nyears. President Recep\nTayyip Erdogan was\nPrime Minister from\n2003- 2014 and President\nfrom 2014. Over that time\nErdogan has survived\na violent coup attempt\nagainst himself and his\ngovernment, as well as\nbringing into force laws\nthat establish Presidential primacy. He has\nalso stoked controversy\nboth within and without\nTurkey with corruption\nscandals and attacks on\nwomen and minorities.\nThe nationalist, violent\nopposition to the creation\nof an independent Kurdish\nstate, or even a region\nof increased Kurdish\nautonomy is entirely\nwithin his prerogative as a\nregional strongman.\nThese factors have\nbeen the prime motivations behind the invasion\nof Syria. The only reason\nthey had not yet been\ncarried out was the\npresence of US forces\nin the area. However,\nDonald Trump, in yet\nanother piece of stunningly blind diplomacy took\nthe decision to withdraw\nthese troops and give the\nTurkish operation the go-ahead.\nThe Turkish plan is\nas well as damming\nevidence that war crimes\nhave been committed has\ncome to the fore. Banned\nsubstances such as white\nphosphorous have been\nobserved to have been\nused by militias loyal to\nTurkey in direct contravention of the rules of war.\nAdditionally, the assault\nhas created thousands\nmore refugees, as families\nflee the assault. Fears of\nTurkish ethnic cleansing\nof Kurdish citizens are\nwidespread. The Turks\n(and, to be fair, the Kurds)\nare definitely not beyond\na little genocide, and then\ndenying it for the rest of\ntime.\nThe immediate impact\nfor the West and the\npeople living in the Syrian\nconflict can only be said\nto be negative. As well\nas losing the goodwill\nSDF-controlled territory (green) and Turkish-controlled territory (red) in October\n2019 // Wikimedia\n\u201cIt has\nevolved over\ntime into one\nof the most\nbrutal modern\nconflicts\u201d\nto assault SDF positions\nin concert with Turkish-backed militia allies\nand establish an exclusion\nzone deep inside Syria\u2019s\nsovereignterritory.Turkey\nthen plans to resettle some\nof the millions of refugees\nthat it currently shelters in\nthe occupied territories.\nOver the few days that\nthe invasion was planned\nbeforethecurrentceasefire\nwas started, accusations\nof human rights abuses,\nand support of a useful\nlocal force, the West has\nalso shown itself to be\nan unreliable ally, and it\nis unlikely to find willing\npartners in the future.\nAdditionally, the West has\nonce more betrayed the\nKurdish people to their\nfate, as in the aftermath\nof the First Gulf War and\nthe 1991 Kurdish uprising\nagainst Saddam Hussein.\nTurkey has been proved\nto be a poor ally for the\nWest. Its cooperation on\nRussia in purchasing the\nS400 missile system, its\nthreats against the EU to\nrelease refugees should\nthe EU condemn its Syrian\ninvasion and Erdogan\u2019s\nconfessed ambitions for\nnuclear weapons raise significant questions for the\nother members of NATO\nas to whether Turkey is a\nsuitable member.\n\u201cThe\nnationalist,\nviolent\nopposition to\nthe creation\nof a region\nof increased\nKurdish\nautonomy\nis entirely\nwithin his\nprerogative\nas a regional\nstrongman\u201d\nThe American withdrawl provides Turkey with chance too good to miss\n\n"

It is excellent.\nIf this introduction\nseems a little strange to\nyou, it will soon become\napparent from the beginning moments of this\nfilm, where we open\nwith two heart-warming\nmonologues from our\nprotagonists followed by\na startling yet hilarious\nrealisation. With its UK\npremiere at the BFI Film\nFestival, Marriage Story\nfollows actress Nicole\n(Scarlett Johannson)\nand her stage-director\nhusband, Charlie (Adam\nDriver), through their\nmessy divorce split\nbetween L.A and New\nYork.\nAfter quietly building\na catalogue of films over\nthe last 15 years, Noah\nBaumbach has built a\nreputation on excellent\nand authentic dialogue,\nand this is no different,\nwith Marriage Story his\nbest work since Frances\nHa. Like many Noah\nBaumbach stories, this\nfilm is heavily centred\naround the characters\nand the relationships they\nhave with each other on\nscreen, with Driver and\nJohansson both giving\ntheir best performances to\ndate.\nMuch like The Squid\nand the Whale this is a\nfilm focused around a\ndivorce, however, almost\n15 years from his original\nbreak-out film, Baumbach\nhas manged to kindle a\ndifferent perspective on\nthe tangled affair and\ncomes at it from a vastly\ndifferent angle. Where\nwe previously saw the\ndivorce through the eyes\nof an acting-out and\ntroublesome teenage son,\nwe now see it from the\nparent\u2019s perspective, with\nnext-to no embellishment\non the details.\nWhat makes this film\nboth devastating yet\ncomedic is the head-on\nnature that Baumbach\nhas tackled the story. We\nget to see the initially\namicable divorce begin\nto turn more and more\nsour as the couple trade\nblows in petty arguments\nand subtle digs, all while\nvying for their son\u2019s time.\nThe comedy comes from\nboth the situation and\nthe dialogue, with both\nparties recognising the\nabsurdity of the situation\nthat they find themselves\nin. It\u2019s a story that showcases the breaking down\nof a relationship, and\nthen the transformation\nthat follows, as both\nparties learn more about\nthemselves and their lost\nlove than they ever knew\nwhile they were together.\nThis transformation of the\ncharacter\u2019s relationship\ntakes centre stage and\nwe\u2019re left to see how they\ndiscover what they find\nmost important as their\nemotions are pushed to\nthe limit.\nDriver and Johansson\nreally showcase their\ntalent here, with subtleties\nin their performance that\nelevate the characters to\nthe projection of what\nBaumbach intended.\nThis is visualised in an\nargument where a whole\nspectrum of emotions\nare shown in just one\nsequence. This discussion\nturned screaming match\nshows minute details in\nmoments of levity amidst\nanger that can only come\nfrom deep understanding\nof human relationships,\nwith the writing and\ndirection from Baumbach\ncast brilliantly in the\nperformance of the actors.\nAt around the 100\nminutes mark there comes\nan onslaught of emotional\nhits as the characters start\ndigging deep to take them\nthrough the divorce, and\nfinding a growing puddle\nat your feet by the end\nwouldn\u2019t be out of place.\nThis is Baumbach\u2019s best\nfeature to date, and will\nleave you with the strongest bittersweet taste your\npalate has known.\nTammy and the T-Rex\nT\nwo years ago, a\nfriend of mine\nfirst introduced\nme to Tammy and\nthe T-Rex: \u201cDinosaurs?\nRomance? On YouTube?\u201d\nI thought to myself. \u201cThis\nis too good to be true\u201d.It\nwas not.\nWe spent the next\nhour and a half watching\nStewart Raffill\u2019s incredible brainchild, a memory I\nrecall with great fondness.\nThe Citizen Kane of\ndinosaur-romances \u2013 I\ninvite you to treat yourself\nto this unique piece of\ncinema. Written in a week\non the prompt of a shady\nanimatronic T-Rex owner:\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a story, but\nwe have to start filming\nwithin the month!\u201d TATR\ntells the story of star-crossed lovers Michael\n(Paul Walker) and Tammy\n(Denise Richards), kept\napart only by Tammy\u2019s\nbitter, violent boyfriend\nBilly who decides to teach\nMichael a lesson roman\nstyle: by locking him in a\nlion enclosure.\nOne hospital kidnapping and a raunchy (don\u2019t\nask) brain transplant\nlater our protagonist\nfinds himself trapped in\nthe body of an animatronic T-Rex. A moment\npotent with emotion, fit\nto lacerate the heart of\nany hardened Game of\nThrones viewer, follows\nas Michael watches his\nown body, lying dead\non the laboratory table,\nfrom behind the T-Rex\u2019s\nplastic eyes. The viewer\nis best advised to consider\nthis moment of character\nmotivation when contemplating his later killing\nsprees. If the characters\ncrushed to death underfoot are too much to bear,\nremember that Michael is\nalso an orphan raised by\nhis alcoholic uncle.\nInitially, the amount\nof murder Tammy\u2019s\nbeloved T-Rex commits\ninclined me to suggest\ndinosaurs remain relegated to troublesome forces\nof nature, or less, as in\nJurassic park (released\nconspicuously less than a\nyear before TATR). Upon\nfurther reflection, this\nfeels unfair. As a giant\nT-Rex, Michael\u2019s passion\nis uninhibited by the\nprimitive Judeo-Christian\nvalues which keep us in\nperpetual servitude to\ncapitalism\u2019s unjust and\noppressive overlords,\nrepresented by the\nmanipulative, sleazy Dr\nWachenstein. Only when\nour T-Rex-come-Casanova turns on its oppressor,\nkilling him (SPOILERS),\ncould Michael be liberated\nand the means of production that enslaved him be\nused for liberation. TATR\nworks as a socio-political\ncommentary, subtly illustrating how capitalism (as\nrepresented by our T-Rex)\ncan only lead to death\nand suffering, calling\neach and every viewer to\nrevolution.\nIf T-Rex killing sprees\naren\u2019t so much your\nthing, fear not: romance\nabounds, as sparks fly\nbetween astoundingly\nfamous leads Paul Walker\n(Fast & Furious, She\u2019s\nAll That) and Denise\nRichards (Starship\nTroopers, Charlie Sheen\nSpouse). I can\u2019t comment\non dialogue, having\nwatched an auto-translat-ed Italian version of the\nflick, but I can tell that\naction trumps words here.\nWhen Michael appears\nat Tammy\u2019s window,\na towering therapod,\nhe does not lament her\nbeauty, as in Romeo and\nJuliet\u2019s balcony scene.\nHe instead carries her off\nand brings her flowers, a\ngesture this reviewer considers far more romantic.\nThis film scores on\nevery level, emotion,\naction, deeper meaning.\nThe only thing for you to\ndo now is to watch it.\nSeperate seats for the Subway in this picture perfect shot // Netflix Productions\nFILM\nDominic Ede\nFilm Editor\nDir: Noah Baumbach.\nScript: Noah Baumbach.\nStarring: Adam Driver,\nScarlett Johannson, Laura\nDern\n137 minutes\nMARRIAGE STORY\nFILM\nMiles Guliford\nMusic Editor\nDir: Stuart Raffill\nScript: Stuart Raffill\nStarring: Paul Walker,\nDenise Richards\n108 minutes 1994\nTAMMY AND THE T-REX\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1731\nFELIX\n7\nPUZZLES fsudoku@imperial.ac.uk\nA CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk\nsessions \u2013 but over the\nsummer, speedbumps\nwhich should have been\nforeseen popped up, and\njust as I began the DPFS\nrole I stumbled into the\nmiddle of it. As a result\nof those, we haven\u2019t\nbeen able to deliver the\noffering we wanted to,\nand the project is now \u2018on\npause\u2019 while we reassess\nthe viability.\nFelix: What sort of\nspeedbumps came\nup?\nFH: It was things like the\nCollege needing space\nto clean up the kitchen\nafter 7pm, but the Union\nneeding access earlier\nthan 7pm to do preparation \u2013 these sorts of\nlogistical issues just kept\ncropping up. This should\nhave been noticed, but it\njust wasn\u2019t for a variety\nof reasons. There were\nalso equipment issues \u2013\nthe use of equipment was\nnever fully specified, so\nthe Union thought they\ncould use one thing and\nthe College had different\nexpectations, and every\ntime this happened it\nmeant another item on the\nplanned menu couldn\u2019t be\ndelivered. For example,\nstorage space \u2013 to prevent\nrisk of cross-contamina-tion, the Union and the\nCollege would have to\nstore food in separate\nspaces, especially if the\nUnion changes supplier\nas has been considered.\nAlso, a lot of the equipment is broken \u2013 I believe\nthe College factored\nthis in when deciding\nto close the late service,\nas the cost of repairing\nit wasn\u2019t worth it if they\nwere operating at a loss.\nThere now has to be a\ndiscussion around who\npays for what.\nIt is hard in my role \u2013 I\u2019m\njoining the conversation halfway through.\nHopefully I can resolve\nit this year, but if that\ncan\u2019t happen, the same\nsituation will happen to\nthe next DPFS. It\u2019s hard\nto generate consistent\nstudent-side pressure this\nway.\nFelix: Has staff turnover at the Union\ncontributed to these\nmiscommunications?\nFH: I do think so. In any\nteam you need to trust\npeople, and trust that there\nwill be good handover.\nSometimes that happens,\nsometimes it doesn\u2019t \u2013 as\neither an honest mistake or\nbecause someone is trying\nto get away with saying\nthey\u2019ve done something\nthey haven\u2019t until they can\ncatch up. It\u2019s the nature\nof working in any organisation or business. The\nthing is that this problem\nis exacerbated when you\nhave high turnover \u2013 and\neven for a student union,\nwe have high turnover. It\u2019s\nunfortunate that commercial services at the Union\nhas had such a bad time\nwith this between July\nand September, just when\nall these things were being\naddressed \u2013 so information got lost in translation.\nFor example, we lost our\noperations manager, who\nsits just below the head of\nthe commercial services\ndirectorate \u2013 but we have\nthe replacement coming\nin on the 4th of November.\nIt\u2019s hard to deal with then.\nPeople step up and take\nresponsibility for things\nthat are not part of their\nrole in the interim, and\nthen you have someone\nnew joining, and have\nto decide: do I trial them\nby fire, or do I try to take\non more of the work\nso I can ease them into\nit? Which works better,\nwhat\u2019s the balance? It gets\noverwhelming. All I can\ndo in my role is apologise\n\u2013 there is no excuse for it.\nBut we\u2019re bringing in the\nnew operations manager,\nand have hired three more\nbar managers to join Trish\nwho joined in August, so\nonce they are settled in\nthere will be no excuse\nfor the staff side of it not\nbeing able to deal with\nh-bar.\nFelix: So the project\nis officially on pause?\nFH: Yes. Abhijay, the\nUnion President, and I\nwill talk to College over\nthe coming weeks to see\nif there is a short-term\nsolution, and meanwhile\nwe\u2019ll be assessing the\nagreement made with\nCollege as the premise\nof it \u2013 that the kitchen is\nready-to-go \u2013 just isn\u2019t\ncorrect. Right now, the\nbest we can do is offer\nsmall gestures, things like\ntoasties and hot-dogs, but\nthat feels really half-ar-sed. We don\u2019t want to do\nthat, it\u2019s not acceptable.\nWe want to provide something in the spirit of a true\nmenu, rather than offer\na token to try to quieten\npeople and gloss over the\nissue.\nI\u2019m keeping my ear to\nthe ground and listening\nfor if postgraduates\nwould prefer these small\ngestures over no service at\nall, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m\nhearing. I talk to the GSU\nPresident, Mohit, about\nthis regularly, and do\nget emails about it from\nstudents. If I\u2019m wrong\nand that desire is there, I\u2019ll\nlook into it, but only then.\nFelix: What about\n568? The\u2018Welcome\nWeek\u2019menu lasted a\nlot longer than just\nthe first week.\nFH: We had the soft\nlaunch in Welcome Week,\nbut realised we needed to\nmake tweaks to the menu\nand to the presentation of\nthe food. We\u2019ve all seen\nthe pizza on Reddit! So\nwe\u2019ve tried to improve\nquality control \u2013 which\ncaused a delay, but we\ndidn\u2019t want to expand to\nthe full menu until we\nknew we had the limited\none right.\nFelix: So what was\ngoing wrong in terms\nof quality assurance?\nFH: We\u2019ve introduced\n\u2018spec cards\u2019 which detail\nportion sizes and how\nmeals should be pre-sented, so that whenever\nyou order a burger or\npizza it should look the\nsame every time. This is\nnew, something we are\ntrialling, and we\u2019ve had to\nget the chefs and kitchen\nstaff on board, as well as\nencouraging floor staff\nat the bar to take note\nof food that needs to be\npresented better and let\na supervisor know. That\njust took some time.\nFelix: Why has the\nmenu only been\nchanged now, if the\nprevious one was\ndissatisfactory?\nFH: I wouldn\u2019t say it was\ndissatisfactory \u2013 but if\nyou look at the old menu,\nthere were items that were\nnever being ordered, and\nsupplies for them just\ntook up space. Nothing\nhad changed in years \u2013 the\nmost exciting thing was\nintroducing sweet potato\nfries \u2013 so it was time to\nfreshen it up, introduce\nmore fresh produce, and\nto take up a better attitude\nwith regards to presenta-tion. There\u2019s no point in\noffering a billion items for\nthe sake of it. If you want\nto be good at it, you need\na smaller menu \u2013 that\u2019s\nwhat the best restaurants\ndo, so they can perfect\nand finesse every dish.\nWe\u2019ve now got healthier\nand more seasonally\nappropriate food \u2013 we\u2019re\ndoing soups, for example,\nand I\u2019ve heard the hotpot\nis really good.\nFelix: So will you be\ngathering feedback?\nFH: Yeah \u2013 I\u2019ve put QR\ncodes on all the tables,\nwhich will take you\nstraight to a short survey\nasking for ratings and\nopen-ended thoughts on\nfood, drinks, and service.\nFelix: It\u2019s been noted\nthat the prices have\nincreased again!\nFH: They go up every\nyear. To clarify, we aim to\nmaintain the same margin\nevery single year \u2013 when\nwe raise prices, it isn\u2019t\nto increase profit, but to\nmaintain it. The issue is\nthat the cost of supply\nhas raised every year as\nwell. A few years ago,\nthe prices hadn\u2019t been\nupdated in a while, and the\nmargins were getting very\ntight \u2013 which meant less\nmoney for clubs and so-cieties. Our drinks prices\nhave also increased, but\nthat\u2019s partially because\nof our contract with the\nsupplier, which specified\nthat prices could increase\nup to 40% over the three\nyear duration.\nFelix: Is that not a\nterrible contract?\nFH: I don\u2019t know the\nreasoning behind it \u2013 the\npeople who signed it no\nlonger work here. We\u2019re\nback to that same issue\nwith passing down knowledge and turnover!\nFelix: Regarding margins\n\u2013 it was noted that during\nWelcome Week, there\nwere some very large ads\npasted onto the tables,\nwhich has received some\nbacklash.\nFH: That\u2019s not actually a\ndecision made by commercial services, and none\nof the Officer Trustees\nwere aware of it prior. But\nI don\u2019t disagree with it. I\nunderstand that it might\nfeel a bit cheap, and we\ndon\u2019t want to give new\nor returning students the\nimpression that we\u2019ll sell\nout for cash \u2013 but think\nabout where that money\ngoes. It goes back into\nclubs and societies and\nother Union services. The\ngood that we can do with\nit is really valuable, and I\nhope that along with our\nevents and the quality of\nthe bar we can outweigh\nany negative impression.\nFelix: Is there anything else you\u2019ve\nbeen working on?\nFH: Earlier I mentioned\nsigning off on sponsorships for clubs and soci-eties. I\u2019ve introduced a\nnew system for it this year\nwhich means I\u2019m getting\nthrough them a lot faster\nas they come up, rather\nthan setting aside time\nfor it later \u2013 which never\nturns out to be enough\ntime anyway. I\u2019m also\ntrying to develop online\nvideo tutorials for chairs\nand treasurers to refer\nto \u2013 it won\u2019t be ready this\nyear but hopefully will\nhelp next year. Currently\nour training is really\ngood for people with a\nbit of knowledge, but for\nanyone who is completely\nnew it doesn\u2019t work so\nwell. I get a lot of specific\nqueries about small things,\nand am slowly gaining\nan almost encyclopaedic\nknowledge of random\nVAT facts and such! So I\nwant to use that and turn it\ninto a more cohesive and\ncomprehensive guide.\n\n"
