    "content": "FELIX Reviews Theatre\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company in \" The Return of AJ Raffles\"\nby Graham Greene. at the Aldwych Theatre.\nHaving sat through two and a half\nhours of this play, I can only wish that\nI had seen the RSC s production of\n\"Sherlock Holmes\" last year. For it is\nsaid that Graham Greene's inspiration to\nbring A J Raffles back to life came from\nthat production. Raffles is the antithesis\nof Holmes, being an amateur cracks man and gentleman cricketer, however their\ncreators were brothers-in-law. I suspect\nthat EW Hornung, the author of the\nRaffles stories, would be turning in his\nEdwardian grave at this resurrection of\nhis gentleman thief.\nHornung left Raffles dead on the\nfield of battle at Spion Kop, in the\nBoer War, but just as Holmes returned\nfrom the incident at the Reichenbach\nFalls, so Raffles comes back thinly\ndisguised as Inspector Mackenzie of\nScotland Yard, his greatest adversary; a disguise . which all save Bunny, the\nfaithful counterpart of Doctor Watson, can see through, for Raffles forgets that\nMackenzie has a permanently running\nnose.\nThe rather weak plot involves the\ntheft, at the instigation of Lord Alfred\nDouglas, of gold sovereigns from the\nMarquess of Queensberry's safe. The Marguess is of course the celebrated\npatron of boxing and his son. Lord Alfred, the intimate friend of Oscar Wilde, with whom Bunny has recently\nspent several years in Reading gaol.\nThere are only two characters who\nsave this play from disaster. The first\nis the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, who has arranged to spend the\nnight in the Marquess' bedroom, under\nthe pseudonym of 'Mr Portland', with a Lady. His Royal Highness is admirably\nplayed by Paul Rogers with a deep\nguttural German accent. He insists on\nhis name as 'Mr Portland' and accepts\nRaffles' explanation that he is Jones\nthe butler, backed up by the fact that\nJones has brought the best Champagne.\nThey exchange re misc en ces as two\ngentlemen would. Unfortunately Jones\nhas failed to reverse his waistcoat\nfrom White of a guest to the black worn\nby a butler. HRH praises Raffles as a survivor of Spoin Kop and accepts the\ngift of a small silver box engraved\nwith the name of general Bofors, which\nhas been quietly severed from its silver chain during Raffles' imprisonment\nby the Boers.\nMichael Bryant is Captain von Blixen, a German spy engaged by the Prince'3 nephew, Kaiser Wilhelm, to steal HRH' s most secret love letters. He has been\ntrained as a waiter in one of the best\nhotels in Berlin and remains stiff and\ncorrect, even when persuaded to remove\nhis waiter's jacket and trousers (Moss\nBros, wouldn't like to find blood stains\non one of their hired suits, would they?),\npreparatory to being shot.\nParents looking for a good Christmas outing for the children would be ill advised to take them to this play. What\non the surface seems to be a harmless\nthriller in the Sherlock Homes mould,\nis interspersed with scarcely veiled references to homosexuality and lesbian-ism. Cricket also comes in for a beating;\nthis is Raffles' alternative hobby \u2014 he\nsaved the ashes for England in ' 9 6 . It\nbecomes quite obvious, by the end of the\nplay that, in his return, he will be better\ncut out for cricket than for cracks man ship. It is only by the intervention of the\nPrince of Wales that Inspector Mackenzie\nis prevented from slipping his bracelets\nonto the hero.\nThomas Stevenson\nGood but foolhardy\nThese Dramsoc productions just\nseem to get worse. \" The Captain of\nKo penick\" which ran from Tuesday\nto Saturday last week in Be it Theatre\nappeared too often to be an example of\namateurism run amok. There is more\nthan one contributory factor involved.\nFirst the play itself is a bum choice.\nSet in Prussia around the turn of the\ncentury, Wilhelm Voigt, a der elect( though not really his own fault) with\nnot much brain power, finds that without\na work-permit he can't get a job; addition\nally, without a job there is no way\nthat he can have a work-permit. Neither\ncan he get a passport, nor a birth\ncertificate such is the stratified, self-contradictory bureaucracy of the time.\nThe authorities will not even send him\nback tp prison because, in their own\nwords, \"there is not a form for it.\"\nWe soon learn that there are basically two classes of people in existence during\nthis period: the military, and those\ntrying to get into the military. Everyone\nappears to have an exaggerated felis h for pretty uniforms (and, occasionally, anti-semitism).\nEventually returning to prison, a submissive Voigt becomes familiar\nwith military procedures and jargon\nthrough the mock battles staged by the\ninmates under the generalship of the\nfoppish prison governor. On his release\nhe is persecuted again by the authorities,\nbut in an em barras ingly contrived scene\nhe is mistaken as being ex-military and\nso hits on a plan to impersonate an\nofficer, imprison the mayor of Ko penick, disappear, then offer to solve the case for\nBerlin police in return for a passport \u2014\nto be collected after his ten years\ninside. The play is supposed to be based\non fact; the author must have allowed\nhimself considerable licence in the\nlicence in the transliteration.\nAs Voight, JOHN WOODFIN became\nmore and more credible as the play prog-res sed. In a difficult part he put in an out-Dramatic Society: The Captain of\nKopenick by Carl Zuckmayer (adapted\nby John Mortimer), directed by Eric\nSt o veil.\nstanding effort and deserves high praise.\nTOM STEVENSON too, as Obermuller the\nmayor of Kopenick, shone. He certainly\nbrought some badly needed vivacity onto\nthe stage. He was totally compelling to\nwatch, despite his occasional hamming.\nJOHN DOWNES produced fleeting gli mse s of brilliance on occasion, but one felt all too often that we were watching J.D. playing the parts of K alle and the police inspector rather than those parts being played\nby J.D. All credit to him nevertheless for\nattempting to brighten things up with\nmannerisms,facial expressions and a varied\ndelivery of dialogue.\nThe first few scenes are mercilessly slow; indeed the whole of the first act\n(ten scenes in all) seems to be there in\na groan ish attempt to give substance to\nthe meat of the action which takes place\nin the last four scenes of the second\n(and final) act.\nThe period of Voigt's recognition of\nhis fate when the Rixdorf authorities\norder him to leave town has its genuine\npoignancy smeared in the following\nscene by the ill-conceived (from the\nplaywright's point of view) transition\nthat he undergoes in the park from\nbeing a trite nobody to existing as\nsomeone capable of latching on to an\nambitious idea and taking steps to\nexecute a plan. That scene is an all-time\nlow in the play per se.\nSo much for the choice of the play.\nThe production must also take a lot of\nstick. The play looked under-rehearsed\nand stale through lack of direction.\nWith over seventy parts being acted by\nthirty players, it is hardly surprising\nthat many of the cast had but a superficial\nunderstanding of their characters which\noften came across as pale pastiches. But\nlet us deal with the good guys first.\nOf the minor parts, mention should be\nmade of STEVE RANDALL( an excel lent\nporter, but he could have strutted more as\nthe grenadier and sergeant), ROGER PHILLIPS( good sense of occasion and\ntiming), MATTHEW CLEMENTS( facial\nreactions excellent), SIMON LEA( conf id ent with good mannerisms), ANDREW MAXWELL( understood his characters) and\nJULIA ROSS (compelling as the mayor's slattern wife). Zero out of ten must go to\nMIKE* ELK IN whose permanently smiling\nfeatures were a distraction and appeared to\nreflect a lack of interest in what he was\ndoing. Many of the other minor parts were\ncharacterised by bad picking-up of cues,\nand little thought being given to the timing\nof pauses.\nThat brings me to the director, ERIC STOVE LL. To attempt an ambitious production with a cast of thirty is in my view\nfoolhardiness in the extreme. The direction\nin the first act needed a much tighter grip\non the cast. It rather appeared that the\ndirector had taken minimal, interest in the\nway the players were acting their parts.\nAct two was a large improvement overall\nthe scenes were finally beginning to have\ncohesion, but with a few exceptions they\nstill tended to fall short of the mark. One\nline was something like, 'Its OK.The\nexcitement's over' I grimaced for, there\nhad been no 'excitement' in that scene at\nall. The costumes were, on the whole,\nexcellent; the convict's attire was stunning\nThe sets were extremely well constructed\nand the music throughout was very skilfully\nchosen. Make-up too was above par.\nWhilst one can recognise the huge\namount of time and effort which goes into\nsuch a production, one is nevertheless\nforced to wonder if Dramsoc were simply\nusing this play as a vehicle to initiate\ntheir new (and as yet inexperienced)\nmem if cer s. The ethic is questionable\"\nMIKE WILLIAMS\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nCROSS COUNTRY A PINNACLE to which we had\nlong aspired was convincingly\nconquered last Saturday when the\nl(l st team won the University of\nLondon Championships for the\nfirst time since 1968. This success\nwas centred on the performances\nof the tireless trio: Rob Allinson,\nwho won the race in 28.04 \u2014'a fair run' \u2014 and with it the Charles\nMoor Memorial Trophy; Steve\nWebb, in 3rd place, reaching fitness with the aid of his advanced\ntechnology racing spikes; and\nIan Ellis, that well-known slacker,\nin 5th place. Sterling support\ncame from the remaining first\nlearners, Paul Clarke (13th), Alf Garnett (15th), and Dave Jones\n(21st). For their very creditable\nefforts, the aforementioned\ndeserve much praise in rounding\noff the term's running most\nsatisfactorily.\nLet us not forget the IC 2nd team. The focal point of pre-race\nattention and nerves, Tony Weir,\nhaving finally decided upon the\noptimal mode of footwear, led us\nin, in 24th, followed by the Spray\nKid in 29th. A long gap was then\nfilled in by a big rush of l Pete Mike, Colin and Martin.

    "content": "MU X Telix\nIt has been a long arduous term for many people and many\nevents of significance and insignificance have taken place.\nThe most recent of these was the NUS annual conference held\nin Scarborough.\nThe conference which tended to be dominated by petty\npolitical squabbling and bitching produced a mixture of policies which on the whole are good common sense policies. On the other hand it also produced no policy whatsoever as\nregards the issue of democracy within NUS. Yet this was the\nissue that should have been the highlight of the conference\nand that many people at conference wished to see something\nbeing done about. That is, people wanted to see NUS have a policy, the nature of the policy differing from each political grouping to the next.\nThis was not to be. A combination of political man oe uv ring, lies and bad chairing contrived to ensure a fruitless result to a debate sadly lacking in common sense and fines e. It does National Union's image no good when one of its leadership stands up at a national conference and tells lies\nand is then backed-up by the President. It is not only gross\nirresponsibility, it is a betrayal of the membership they claim\nto represent and shows utter contempt for conference, a body\nwhich these same self people proclaim is the sovereign body\nof the National Union. I should like to apologise to SCAB for the cock-up that\noccurred in last weeks issue and thus ruined the presentation\nof what was a good feature. My apologies also to the countless\nothers whose articles have not always been put in in the\ncorrect order \u2014 we'll try harder next term.\nI should also like to thank the staff for their hard work this\nterm, and also Robin Gray who did a lot of our typing for this\nweek.\nLastly, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all!( PS. - Support NUS Travel).\nWARNING\nThe National Westminster Bank, local Police and\nSecurity Officers at Imperial College are becoming\nincreasingly concerned at the number of thefts of\ncheque books, cheque cards and credit cards taking\nplace on the College Premises. In the main thefts\noccur from jackets left unattended in offices and\nlecture rooms.\nWe ask all customers to ensure that all such items\nare kept quite separately on their persons and that\nevery precaution is taken to safeguard them at all\ntimes.\nRCC Transport\nThe following important changes\nhave or are about to take place:-1. From 1st Dec.1975 the fee for\nthe RC C driving test will be 75p. The increase of 25p will go to the\ntester.\nThe driver's security remains\nat \u00a35.\n2. The non-priority minibus will become the priority vehicle for\nACC for an experimental period \u2014\nthroughout the Spring Term \u2014\nstarting Jan5 th1976. This means that all five RC C vehicles are priority vehicles for\ncertain clubs during this period.\n3. It appears that from l st January\n1976, new qualifying drivers will have to be over 21 years of age\nbefore they can drive large passenger vehicles (9 or more seats).\nDrivers already holding a full\ndriving licence before 1st January\n1976 may continue to drive such\nvehicles. Your attention is drew n to leaflet D.100 issued by the\nDepartment of the Environment.\nAnyone still wishing to book RC C vehicles during the Xmas vacation\nshould contact Mike Wright (int.\n4125) immediately.\nMutters\nArising\nYuletide Greetings, one and all My Xmas offering must have the\nhighest na use rating ever. I do\nnot apologise for it \u2014 I just claim diminished responsibility.\nAnd now\nAn Executive Christmas Carol\nOnce upon a time, there was a merry old soul called Burt Teague\nHe was a cheery little chap and\nevery year he went on holiday to\nhis favourite holiday camp,\nsituated on the South Downs. He\nalways enjoyed himself \u2014 he\nplayed golf, football, snooker\nand ping pong.\nOne summer whilst he was on\njust such a holiday, he decided\nto go fishing, so off he set. He\nwent to the little village of\nTimbray, which is an old and unspoilt little place, in Kent. Burt\nhad fun. He had a go at winkle\npicking, but he was not very good\nat it. As a local put it, ' Ee dont\npick'ard enough!\nBurt also entered the local\nfishing competition, in which he\ncame second, netting a121b white Roe. In fact, he was so good, the winner had to che et 'ham\n(ugh!). Having worked-up a good\nthirst Burt toddled off to the bar\nand ordered a martini, 'Shake' it\nbut don't stir', he ordered as he\ncogitated over the competition.\nBurt was not a bright man, but\nhe knew he'd been fiddled, He was\nadamant that he should get his own\nback; 'Once bot ten, twice shy may\nalright for some', mused Burt\n'but can I let him get away with it?\nGod, fr eyed not \u2014 his head needs\ns'limming down to fit his hat!'\nBut Burt had to leave the camp\nthe next day, so he took the guy\non one side and whispered, 'Hoy\nlets have a rematch, huh, next\nyear, he are at Tray?' 'Sure' came\nthe reply.\nThe it would be different\nThe End. Having got that rubbish out of\nmy system, may I only say \u2014\nHappy New Year and a Merry\nCrimple.\nJohn\nRIZ LA READ The end of the first term approaches\nall too quickly for some while the\nthe term has crawled for others,\nso much so, that the remaining few\nhours seems a lifetime.\nThe mummies and daddies have\ncome to collect their hard drinking\n(I mean) working Johnny from\nCollege. Mummy holds him tight,\nproud of the high academic level\nthat her ' child' has reached. After\nall what academic level could be\nhigher than to get drunk every\nnight for eleven consecutive weeks\n(helping to boost the bar profits!);\nor sitting nude in the Lower Lounge,\nand think of the hours spent gazing\nat those knickers in the Bar, not to\nmention the highest honour achieved\nby the few of streaking round the\nAlbert Hall( I wonder if, 'We wo trl d have been amused by that?')\nHowever, I have it from a prominent\nmember of the College that, it all helps to develop the abilities of\nthe 'future' leaders of the country.\nOh! Sorry I almost forgot the\nladies of IC some of whom have\nprobably tried in vain to create an\nimpression on the traditions of IC.\nHaving learnt of the self preserving instinct of the IC male, most\nof them in all probability have had\nto make-a speedy withdraw I to\ntheir rooms and restrict themselves\nto talking to a few friends who do\nnot always regard them as possessed by voyeurism.\nYes my friends, the end is nigh!\nYou have to leave this superlative\nworld of fanta cy which the Tolkien, Peak or Sartre for that matter,\nbegin to imagine, let alone contemplate surpassing.\nDo not give up hope my fellow\ncollegians; all is not lost! Just\nimagine yourselves on the 5th January with the grant check in\nyour pocket and with renewed desire\nto perpetuate this unique kingdom of\na thousand and one weird and\nwonderful events. A kingdom in\nwhich Alice will not only be truly\nlost, but that her wonder will be so great that she would not be ' allow ed' to say ' But I don't understand\nQueen of Hearts'.\nHappy Christmas to you all and\nhave a' cosmic' New Year.\nSee you all next term.\nRIZ\n\n"

The Governors will\nmeet on the 19th December to\ndecide on the recommendations.\nTravel lose\n\u00a3250,000\nAUDITED ACCOUNTS presented at the NUS Annual\nconference in Scarborough last weekend revealed that\nthe travel section of the NUS services made a loss of\nabout \u00a3250,000 in the financial year to end in May 1976.\nThe accounts cover the seventeen months of trading to\nMay 1976.\nSeveral ' reasons are given for\nthe loss incurred; including the\nfact that the accounts covers two\nWinter periods, \u2014 September to\nMay, \u2014 which are slack seasons.\nOther factors contributing to the\nloss are the general depression in\nthe travel business, increase in\nMerry Xmas and happy new year from FELIX staff!!\nBack row (left to right): David Knights Ulysses Ma Mike Williams, Ian Morse, David I HopKins, Nigel Williams, Duncan Suss..\nFront row (left to right): Terry West o by, Philip Dean, Paul Ek pen yong and John McCloskey Not in the picture: Andrew Hall, Andrew Walker, Anne Stevenson, Tom, Chris, MW,\nTony JcTnes and last but not least Gill McCon way( hope you get well soon Gill) fuel costs and the closure of\nGreek airspace during their peak\nweek last August.\nIn a move to eradicate this\nloss, NUS Travel is making drastic cuts in its services next term.\nAlthough they will be promoting\ntheir fours, rail cards and ISIC\ncards heavily with the help of\nconstituent organizations, the\npublicity department's budget is\nbeing slashed by \u00a350.000. The\nnext ' NUS Traveller' to be printed\nwill have fewer pages and is to be\ndistributed by local NUS areas\nthus saving NUS Travel a considerable expense.\nMike Naylor, Managing Director\nof NUS Travel says that a profit\nof between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3100,000\ntp keep the company as an on-going viability. Their main problem\nwas one of cash flow, CO's could\nhelp by public ising NUS Travel\nand many have already agreed to\ndo so through their local student\npapers.\nIt would also be possible\nnext year for many more students\nto take their friends on hoi i day with them because 80\u201485% of the\ntours to be provided contain no\neligibility clauses. Although there is great concern\nbeing expressed about the situ a tion, the position should improve\ngiven that NUS Travel receives\nthe cooperation it needs.\nIf NUS Travel were to collapse\nthen End sleigh Insurance would\nalso fold. The consequences for\nthe National Union would be disastrous and in all probability\nNUS's campaign department would\nhave to cease activities. In this case of such an event-u ali ty, students on holiday would\nnot find themes elves stranded\nabroad due to the bonding system\nthat NUS Travel has. "

Despite\nthis however, Charles Clarke, NUS President, supported the\nposition taken by Mr Stewart\nwhen he showed conference the\noffending letter.\nMr Everett has since been\nshown to be right in his all eg at ion.

    "content": "FELIX 7\nRUGBY Imperial College A's6 Sidcup V13 THE DAY STARTED with a few last minute panics. As usual, the major one being\nthe late arrival of the coach\n- and finally, with fifteen\nmen and a referee, we\ndeparted. Sidcup arrived\nmore or less on time, but\nwith fourteen men only. A hasty conference in the\nA's changing room ensued\nand then it was decided to\ngrant the plea of the First s for a player to make up their\nteam so that they could\nface fifteen men while we\nmatched the Sidcup fourteen.\nThe game was schedule to\nstart at 2.30pm and to\neveryone's amazement it did. Both sides settled down\nquickly and soon the collective heart of the A's missed a beat when a sidcup man\ntried to drop a goal from the\nhalf-way line, and almost\nsucceeded. The A's soon put\na stop to this un sporting activity but not before that\nsame Sidcup player had\nscored from a penalty,\nCutting the A's undeservedly\ne hind. We were quickly\nback in the attack and\nunlucky not to score. John\nFishburn broke through on\nthe left and gave a well timed pass to Mike Siomiak\nwho was brought down about\nten yards out. The A's did not have to wi at long for\nsome reward. Rod Porter,\nplaying his heart out, got\nthe ball on their twenty-five\nand beat three players to\nscore an excellent try. Dick Pullen made the conversion\nlook easy. That left the\nA's6 \u20143 up at half time.\nThe second half was much\nmore hectic. Unfortunately,\nlax marking at a line-out\nlet Sidcup in for a soft try.\nThe A's went straight back\nat them but no moves reached\nfruition, and in fact there\nwas another mistake which\nresulted in another try\nby Sidcup. The A's did not\ngive up. The forwards came\ninto their own, led by John\nFishburn and Rod Porter. In\nthe last ten minutes the\nA's, playing some good\nrugby, came very close to\nscoring but not close enough.\nChris Becque and Rich\nJenner were both stopped\nright on the line. John Day, a last-minute addition to the\nteam, played well, although\nout of position. But Sidcup\nheld on, and won 1 3 - 6 .\nThat completes the pre-Chrlstmas matches and\nleaves us with a reasonable\nrecord, having won five\nand lost three. Our first\ngame 'next term is on 10th January, assuming \u2022 that\neveryone has recovered\nfrom the festivities.\nA Happy Christmas to\nall our FELIX supporters.\nTeam: R Pullen, L Daves,\nC Becque, R Leeson, J Thomas,\nR Jenner, B Bubb, J Day, S Downing, C Cuthbertson, R Porter, M Siomiak, J Fishburn.\nby Christopher Cuthbertson\nFOOTBALL Imperial College 1st XI\nLSE 1st XI\nON WEDNESDAY, the 3rd of December IC 1st XI\ntravelled to the picturesque\nLSE ground. Although\nhampered by injuries to four\nkey players, IC started well, and the brisk open football\nmade a mockery of the poor\npitch. However, LSE managed\nto score first, following a fine move down the left. The\ngame degenerated into a scrappy affair, with both\nteams finding it difficult\nto keep their feet on a pitch\nthat was now cutting up\nconsiderably, and the score\nremained the same till\nhalf time.\nIn the second half IC\nattacked well, and achieved\na penalty after an LSE defender had handled the\nball. The job was given to\nTerry Lindon, who calmly\nslotted the ball home, the\n'keeper making every effort\nto dive out of the way. This lifted IC, and soon after\nthis, Phil Singleton sent a fine ball to the far post for\nDave Rudd to send a blistering\nheader past a stranded 'Keeper\n- 2\u20141, and more to come.\nA flowing move down the\nleft ended with Phil Singleton,\nsurely the man of the match,\nsending a scorching shot\ntowards the LSE goal. The shot was good, the save was better. However, IC were\nsure to score again, and\nlittle Steve Gee, opportunist\nextra ordinaire, snapped up a half-chance to make the\nscore 3 - 1 . You just can't, HOCKEY Imperial College II\nWallingford\n1\n5\nWE ARRIVED at Harlington\nhaving lost our half-back\nline, who had been relegated\nto the 1st XI. We were thus\nforced to change our famous\n\" system\" that has brought\nus such unqualified success recently.\nStraight from the bully-off\nit was obvious that the\ndefence was finding it\nhard to adjust and the\nI opposition quickly took a one goal lead. A second\ngoal followed some good\nplay from the opposition's fast and skilful wings. The IC defence now began to\nfind its feet( and the\nopposition forwards!) and\nthis gave confidence to the\nother players and we came\nback strongly to force a goal.\nThe second half was remarkable for the umpires\nsudden loss of interest\nin upholding the off-side\nrule. This led to the opposition\nscoring 3 goals with no\nreply from IC.\nAll in all, a disappointing\nafternoons hockey.\nTeam: R Hutson, J Huckle,\nM Callun, D Balderson (capt)\nTSethi, Pete, Effendi Rahman,\nB Middleton, A Brewster, S Golding.\nlet men like Steve Gee\nhave that much room in the\nbox. This crowned a glorious\nsecond-half display from IC,\nsurely their best of the\nseason.\nReviews continued\nComposed during the Christmas period of\n1734, Bachs Christmas Oratorio shone\nbrilliantly in a blaze of gusto and enthusiasm\nwitnessed by a packed audience in the\nGreat Hall last Friday night. The Choir,\ndespite a twinge of under strength in the\nsoprano section, produced an uncharacteristic warmth in their singing which was a fitting match to the beauty and complexity\nof one of Bach' s legendary works. The Oratorio was necessarily abridged, one part\nwas omitted completely and the libert to was\nin English \u2014 a wise move.\nThe soloists in my view were slightly\ndisappointing. The soprano, GILLIAN JASON was the best Of the bunch. Her singing was\nclear, controlled and un exaggerated; there\nwas lit tie shrillness. RICHARD FR EWER, singing the tenor part, seemed a little too\nanimated in his posture at times. Hissing ing was on the whole excellent except that\nhe was flat on some of the more tricky\npassing notes. CHRISTINE AS HER, the\ncontralto, suffered from ali spy' s', and\nas a result was distracting. Her performance\nwas not without polish however. If you' ll Imperial College Choir: Christmas\nOratorio by J.S. Bach, conducted by\nEric Brown.\nforgive the pun, DAVID W lL SON JOHNSON, the bass, was basically not a bass at all but a baritone. He lacked the necessary\nvocal power required in the F clef to invoke\ndrama into the work.\nThe special orchestra was lead by JOHN BACON who played confidently throughout.\nThe strings wer generally adequate but\nwere sketchy towards the end I felt. The\noboes created a startling warmth and clarity\nduring the symphony at the beginning of part\ntwo. There the usual ' acidity' associated\nwith oboes was gone as they appeared almost\nto resonate in phase. (Pity about the first\noboe's bum note at the end of part two). The continuo of PR U ASH BEE( 'cello) and\nCHRISTOPHER SHAW (harpsichord) was\nfaultless, especially during the recitatives.\nA word of praise must be directed to the\nanonymous first trumpet player. In Bach' s time there were no valves on bass instruments (they only began to be fitted in the 19th century). This means that a complete scale\nwas only possible above- F on the bottom\nspace of the treble stave': below that the\nhorns were limited (reading downwards) to\nmiddle C,A,F, C, and the F below the bass\nstave. With the invention of valves the\ncomplete scale became available throughout\nthe horn's range; as a result composers have\ntended to write horn parts much lower than\nBach did so it is usually with some\ntrepidation that modern trumpet players, who\nare not used to going so high, approach a work by Bach. Not so our anonymous trumpet\nplayer last Friday.' He cruised through the\ndifficult trills in the second aria in part\none and generally managed extremely well. Congratualations to him.\nThe conductor, ERIC BROWN, has\nproduced excellence. He and indeed everyone involved got the ovation which they\nrichly deserved.\nMIKE WILLIAMS "
