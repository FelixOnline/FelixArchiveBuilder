    "content": "Reviews\n16th October 1992 Felix 944\nMandarin Books have released six\ngraphic novels (ie. comic books) of\nsix of the most popular stories that\nhave appeared in 2000 AD and the\nJudge Dredd Megazine. Us being\nthe fortunate s and elitists that we are\nmanaged to wangle an interview\nwith some of the people behind\nthese masterpieces.\nThe man in charge, editor of all\nthe stories in 2000AD, Mr David\nBishop had a few words to say on\nthe future of their best loved\ncharacter.\nFelix; Is Judge Dredd likely be\ncloned?\nDavid; Well, they have a tradition\nin Megacity that if somebody is a great Judge before they die they\ntake a sample of the DNA so they\ncan clone them forever more and\nthey keep a big chunk of them like\nan arm or a leg and use it for the\ncloning. So once he does eventually\npeg out or gets killed probably in\nthe line of duty, I'm thinking he\nshould go out in a blaze of glory just\nbecause he's that kind of guy, they\ncan just knock off a few copies.\nFelix; Why are there no copies at\nthe moment?\nDavid; Well we've got the original\nand I don't think he'd fancy it.\nAlso, whenever they try to do it it\ntends to go wrong. Dredd has got\na very finely balanced temperament\nand whenever they try and do a copy of him it never works very\nwell. There is actually a new story\ncoming out soon where they\nintroduce robot Judges and their\nentire ph s ycie is based on Dredds\nbrain patterns. Which is basically\nlacking in self-control and humanity\nand so it all goes horribly wrong.\nThey start going round and beating\nup on people unnecessarily. The\nwires melt in their heads when they\nget over excited.\nFelix; So you mean that Dredd\ndoesn't beat up on people\nunnecessarily?\nDavid; He gives himself minor\nexcuses, just occasionally he lets\nsome steam out.\nAnd his past...\nFelix; Is Dredd based on any one\nin particular or is he just a mixture\nof all things?\nDavid; Well John Wagner, who\nwrites Judge Dredd, originally\nbased him on Dirty Harry. He'd seen Dirty Harry, this cop who goes\nround shooting people\nunnecessarily, he's got a bad\nattitude problem. He's a bit of a rebel, My way or no way kind of\nattitude. The idea was to take that\ncharacter, make a city where every\n2000 AD cop is like Dirty Harry and set it 20\nyears in the future so you've got all\nsorts of weird villains and it went\nfrom there.\nFelix; Are they going to change the\nname when we catch up with\n2000AD? David; Well no, for every year that\nwe advance it goes one year in\nDredds world too so he'll always be\nahead of us. Why change the name.\nIt's such a brand name.\nFelix; How deeply would you say\nyou were involved in 2000AD, is\nit your life?\nDavid; It's not my life, I do have\na life outside, not a very big one but\nit is there. I purchased it for a small\nprice. You can't just be comics,\nyou'd end up looking up your own\nposterior.\nFelix; Do you think the artists are\nbecoming too blood-thirsty.\nDavid; We-have our limits. We\nnever show women or children\ngetting hurt or killed. All our\nviolence is shown using futuristic\nweapons, we try to avoid stabbings\nand things so that we can't get the\nblame for any thing.\nFelix; Who would you say were\nyour target audience?\nDavid; Well at the moment the\naverage age of 2000AD readers is\n16, for the mega zine it's20. So I'd say that you guys at Imperial would\nmake up our target audience. The\nstories seem to appeal a lot to\npeople who are just leaving school\nor at college.\nFelix; How would you then sum up\nthe comics?\nDavid; Well I'd say if people read\nthem and had a good laugh, enjoyed\nthe stories and the art work, we've\ndone our job.\nFelix; Many thanks.\nNot only all of this but we\nmanaged to track down the man\nhired by the Judge Dredd team to\ninstill a sense of awe and to keep\nup the terror is ation of the citizens,\nMr. Roger Weightman:\nFelix; What makes you dress up as\nJudge Dredd?\nRoger; The money,\nFelix; Your kinky fetish?\nRoger; No, it's just a fascination\nwith the character, I enjoy it I love\ndoing it.\nFelix; So you love the power of\nbeing Judge Dredd\nRoger; Yeah, I love it. I love the\ncharacter himself, the rather\nshooting someone than arresting\nthem.. Judge Dredd is perfect for\nour time, he's lasted now 15 years,\n16 years. It's a little bit of fashion.\nThe interviews\nof the year,\nJudge Dredd\nand his editor...\nFelix; How often do you do, how\noften do you don n your togs and be\nJudge Dredd for the day.\nRoger; It depends I mean, at the\nmoment it's like once a week,\nminimum so it just goes from there.\nAny where that I am needed. We\nare at the moment doing a nation\nwide tour at the moment.\nWeddings, parties, bar mitzvah s. Felix; How did you get roped in to\nplaying the part?\nRoger; Well since they decided to\ndo a live character I 've been it. I got into it totally by accident. I kind\nof think that it is based on me, well\nas a live character. They had the\nidea of making it live and then they\nauditioned people, I didn't audition\nfor it. They just saw me one day and\nsaid 'Well you've got the chin will\nyou do it?'.\nFelix; So the live character is totally\nbased on your chin?\nRoger; Basically yeah.\nFelix; Is your chin insured?\nRoger; (Lots of laughter, well these\nAmericans will laugh at anything\nwon't they) I really wish it was.\nFelix; And the costume, who put\nthat together?\nRoger; It was actually made by a film costume company. I think they\nenjoyed doing it. They used to come\ninto the office with fabric samples\nand say things like \"Will this take\na beating from apl eb, or stand up\nto creeps\"\nFelix; Are there any plans to do a film?\nRoger; Yep, there are.\n' Felix; Using you?\nRoger; Well the plans are to do the\nfilm. My involvement in the film is\nvery minimal at the moment as is\nlikely to stay that way. At the\nmoment the rumour is that\nSctiwartzeneger is going to do it, I think he's got slightly more clout\nthan I have. Of course I am a better\nPage 22\n\n"

Students\nwishing to apply for a student loan\nshould contact the Fees Office in\nroom 334 of the Sherfield building.\nTo be eligible for a loan, students\nmust be resident in the United\nKingdom, under 50 years old, and\nattending a full-time undergraduate\ncourse. At interview, you must be\nable to supply a birth certificate, or\na passport if born outside the UK, along with a letter from your Local\nEducation Authority confirming\nyour award, and details of your\nbank account. A previous bad credit\nrecord will not affect your\neligibility.\n340 students have already applied\nfor the loan, which is worth \u00a3830\nin Inner London this year. Loan\nrepayments do not normally start\nuntil the April after graduation. The\nrate of interest is the previous year's inflation rate, and interest is\ncharged from the date you receive\nyour first loan instalment.\nRepayments can be deferred if the\nstudent is earning less than \u00a31000\nper month.\nStudent loans are not available to\npostgraduates, who have to find HM funding from other sources, such as\nthe Science and Engineering Wm\nResearch Council (SERC), a major\nfunding body for Imperial\npostgraduates. Several\npostgraduates have complained that \u2022Ofthe College Registry refused to pay flk\nout SERC cheques before the start f/L of term on 5 October, despite SJ SERC's guidelines which allow for a j Bb the payment of cheques on 1 111\nOctober. After complaints to their W headquarters, SERC intervened and\nthe cheques were distributed by\nRegistry. The Registry is currently\nnegotiating with SERC to agree a new date for distribution of the\ncheques.\nGla xo Chair Mercy Dash by David Goddard\nProfessor Tony Barrett has been\nappointed to the new Glaxo Chair\nof Organic Chemistry at Imperial\nCollege. Professor Barrett, an IC\ngraduate, worked at the College\nuntil he moved to the United States\nin 1983. Sir Eric Ash, College\nRector, and Dr Richard Sykes,\ndirector of group research at Glaxo,\nboth expressed delight that a leading\norganic chemist had returned to the\nUK. They also said that the new\nchair extended the long standing\nlinks between Imperial College and\nGlaxo. The head, of the Chemistry\nDepartment, Professor David\nPhillips, said that the appointment\n'proves there is no 'London barrier'\nto attracting top people'.\nby Our News Staff\nImperial Chemistry student Ilya\nEigenbrot will return to his native\nRussia on 28 October, bringing\nwith him a van load of humanitarian\nrelief and scientific supplies. Ilya\nwill be accompanied by Ben\nKrystall and Colin Lawrence, and\nthe ten day trek will take the trio\nthrough Sweden and Finland to St.\nPetersberg.\nIlya and his colleagues will be\nbringing medical supplies for\nregional hospitals in St. Petersberg,\nand scientific equipment to research\ncolleges like the Marine\nTechnology Institute.

The\nscheme will be modelled on one in\noperation at Havering Technical\nCollege. The Havering plan\nincludes a 'co-operation network'\nbetween staff and students which\nTerry Briley, Deputy Head of\nSecurity at Imperial, hopes to\nmimic. Mr Briley, who visited\nHavering earlier this week, regards\nthis type of co-operation as a method to reduce crime in the\ncollege.\nWalk-in walk-off crime continues\nat Imperial this week, with the theft\nof \u00a35000 worth of Apple Macintosh\ncomputers from Mechanical\nEngineering. On Monday of this\nweek, \u00a3100 in cash was taken from\nthe City & Guilds Union (C& GU)\noffice. The sum was the proceeds\nof ticket sales for the C& GU Freshers' Buffets.

Hammersmith\nand Fulham Council have now\ndecided to evict the students and\nrenovate the house. Many students\nliving at the house take a special\ninterest in the local community.

There is abu sker like strummed acoustic\nguitar, violin, piano, accordion,\nhammond organ and a straight\nforward rhythm group.\nNevertheless, the producer\nmanaged to create a sound which is\nfar from acoustic, but which is\nsimply honest pop, adding even a quite familiar sounding brass backup to the already dense sound\ncluster.\n'Fireworks' is a lively, animating\ntune which surely gets the crowd\nmoving at a live gig, but it's nothing\nyou've never heard before. That's not a great flaw, however, as any\nfolk music is of such kind (ho-ho).\nButPele's style is neither, and this\nis annoying.\nThe remaining three tracks on the\nmini-CD were produced by Pele\nthemselves and are slightly less\nover laden, but they're still not\ngetting rid of the all-too-obviously\nradio and chart compatible sound.\n'Moondance' is a Van Morrison\ncover version, a rather simple love\nThe Frank & Walters,\nRadiohead, Astoria 9/10/92\nRadiohead are not, as is commonly\nbelieved one band. They are two.\nThe first band are noisy and crap.\nThe second half are mellower,\nalthough not totally menace-free,\nand you can hear the words. This\nmight not be a very trendy\nviewpoint to hold, and probably\nmakes me sound like your parents,\nbut that's just'the way it is. I like\nto know what is being sung about.\nMaybe I'm too old. This second\nhalf sings songs like 'Creep', which\nyou will have heard, and not known\nit. It is (in case you can't be\nbothered to read the review of it\nelsewhere on this page-Poddy) a slow smouldering anthem for the\nlovesick. I think.\nThe Frank And Walters were kind\nof crazy as per usual. All the\nfavourites were there, Michael,\nAndy James, Laurence Olivier,\nAngela Cray, and what's more,\nthey threw loads of plastic toys at\nthe faithful after their traditional\nslaughtering of 'Funky Cold\nMedina'. How can you live without\nthis band?\nLise Yates\n\u2022 Frank & Walters' 'Trains, Boats\nAnd Planes' is out on October 26\nthrough Setanta/Go! Discs. 'Creep'\nis out now on Parlophone.\nsong ('dance' rhyming with\n'romance'), but in a nice jazz\ninspired mood.\nAnother Ian Prowse composition\nis 'Time for Treason', which I found hard to make sense of. While\nthe title promises subversive, 'biting\nsocial comment' (which the band\nhas also been credited for), the\nmusic sounds more like a celebration song, celebrating\nperhaps the Utopian vision\nexpressed in the chorus: 'We'll all\nbe sharing our juice'. Good vision\nto me, as long as they leave me\nsome beer. The CD finishes up with\navers on of the almost traditional\nanti-World War I tune 'The\nGreenfields of France', a welcome\nrelief from the previous pop sounds,\nthe monotonous violin and ever-rattling vocals of Ian Prowse,\nbacked up by an extremely shy\nfemale voice. This still continues\nthroughout the 'Greenfields', but\nthat song proves only slightly\nvulnerable. I like the version that a friend of mine recorded with his\n4-track better, though.\nOf this CD single I sould say: A few good shots, but none has hit the\ngoal, Pele\\ The sixties used to be\na better time.\nJan.\n\u2022 Out now on M&G/ Polydor.\nIndigo Girls,\nHammersmith Odeon\nThe Indigo Girls are not famous in\nBritain. That's why they have to\nsupport the Neville Brothers\". They\ndon't have this problem in their\nnative Georgia, USA. There;, even\nneighbours like RJ SM drop in for an\noccasional album track.\nStill, they started simply with\ntracks from their p'revious albums.\nJust Amy, Emily and a collection\nof guitars. Very nice but not too\ninteresting for the average punter.\nAnother acoustic duo, kit ted out\nwith denim and working boots.\nAmy has a bit of an affinity for head\nbanging, but that was about it. Not\nuntil they started on their new\nmaterial from 'Rites of Passage' did\nthe spark of inspiration become\napparent.\nWhen they added Sara Lee (ex-B52s) on bass, Budgie Banshee on\ndrums plus a couple of assorted\nfiddle and cello players, things were\nlooking up. Then we were off. A gallop through half the album,\nstopping only for guitar changes.\nThe song credits are shared between\nthe trio. Amy, firmly in the little\nknown grunge-folk tradition, bites\nthe heads off jelly babies. Boy is she\nangry. Emily is more Joni Mitchell,\nbut catch that lyrical surgery. The\ndropping honey only hides the bitter\npill of satire. The subjects covered,\ncaressed and tossed away included:\nreincarnation, Virginia Woolf,\nghosts, the milk of human kindness,\nwindy cities and the futility of\ndegrees. Yes, we need this sort of\nstuff. Protest songs have developed\nfrom the brick-in-your-face\napproach. Not that it hurts any less,\nbut now you have to think about it\nfirst.\nStill it nearly went horribly\nwrong at the end. 'Now,' said\nEmily, 'this is a song by Bob\nDylan'. Again, the bus ker syndrome reaps another harvest;\n'Rolling Stone' or 'Watchtower'\nmadam? But no. A victory was\nplucked from the jaws of folk\nsterility by 'Tangled up in Blue' like\nBob would have shaved his 'beard'\nfor. It was rambling and eccentric\nin all the right places before it\nfinally staggered to a ragged\nconclusion. We had heard the light;\nit was somewhere between blue and\nviolet.\nTintin\n9Right of Passage is out now on\nEpic.\nA miserable fat bastard, Not in any way relevant to PWEI\n\n"

RAG also has sets of\nSightseeing Guides (very useful for\nthe Great Sightseeing Challenge\nas well as getting the most out of\nLondon) for the winning five teams.\nSo, it sounds fairly easy, but there\nare some complications - to keep\nyour team on their toes. The C CU motorised mascots will be out on\nthe streets (usually its just the C CU execs!) as Chance and Community\nChest cards. A jail van and jailer\nwill also be roaming the streets,\ntaking unsuspecting teams to\nrandom board locations.\nFinally, as well as the special\nprizes the usual Rag incentives will\nbe available to those who raise\nenough money, hopefully listed\nsomewhere else on this page. You'll\nhave a great time and raise a humongous amount of money for\ncharity, or you could stay in bed all\nday What would you rather be\ndoing?\nIf you want to know more, come\nalong to the rag meeting in the Ents\nlounge opposite Da Vinci's at\n1:10pm Friday lunchtime.\nSO, BE MAD, BE SILLY, AND BE PART OF IT\nRag runs rings round Eros\nPage 11\n\n"

Throughout\nthe film's127 minutes, Cady\nrelentlessly pursues each member of\nBowden's family, with sexual\ntension added by Bowden's wife\nLeigh (Jessica Lange), and one of\nthe most memorable scenes being\nthat with Cady and Bowden's innocent daughter Danielle, a teenager who is just finding her\nwomanhood, played by Juliette\nLewis, alone together. Packed with\nsuspense and horror, the film\nculminates in an epic fight to the\nend featuring excellent special\neffects. Billed as this year's Silence\nof the Lambs, this gripping 'good-versus-evil' story also has cameo\nappearances from the stars of the\noriginal version (Gergory Peck and\nRobert Mitchum) for you to spot.\nSo get into the mood for\nHalloween a week later, and let\nFilmsoc scare you, at 7.30pm on\nThursday 22nd. Doors open at\n7.00pm, entrance is only 90p for\nmembers (membership \u00a3 6 . 5 0\nincluding first film free) and \u00a31.90\nfor non-members, and it promises\nto be a memorable and popular\nfilm.\n1991/92 was a successful year for\nIC Turkish Society. The members\nhave enjoyed exciting day trips to\nAlton Towers and Leeds Castle.\nThe Annual dinner with live\nTurkish music has also brought\ntogether members for another\nhappy event.\nThis academic year, it is time to\njoin the Turkish Society again. We\nwould like to invite you to the\nGliding\nAfter a storming response at\nFreshers' Fair, we ran our first\nTrial Flights last weekend. Saturday\nwas cold but saw some spectacular\nflying as pilots struggled back low\nover the airfield from ridge-soaring\nthe South Downs.

The mountain of Pelion is found\non the east part of Thessaly in\ncentral Greece. The small villages\nwhich are spread on the mountain\nretain a traditional architecture\nwhich\u2014combined with the beautiful\nforests of chestnut trees\u2014have a memorable view. The closest city\nis the city of Volos and this is the\npoint of departure. It is a modern\nindustrial city almost entirely built\nin recent years after considerable\ndestruction by earthquakes. Lolkos\nis the name of the small ancient\nharbour in Volos from which in\nGreek mythology, Jason and the\nArgonauts set out in search of the\nfamous golden fleece.\nThe unique charm of Pelion and\nthe Greek province have greatly\nopened up the area for tourism.\nThroughout the year but especially\nin summer, thousands of Greek and\nforeign visitors pass through Volos\non their way to the fine hotels of the\nvillages of Pelion. In the summer\nseason they come in search of the\npleasures of the sea. In winter they\nclimb up for the ski centre.\nWhatever the season, visitors to\nPelion derive the greatest pleasure\nfrom the natural beauty and scenic\ncharm of this friendly, smiling\nmountain. It's a unique place\nbecause it can combine the quite\nmountainous landscape together\nwith the golden sands by the clear\nblue sea.\nThe traditional houses have\nunique features which will impress\neven the most casual visitor. They\nare three-storied on one side usually\nat the front, and one storied on the\nother, inspired by the regions' steep\nincline. The other peculiar feature\nis the beautiful drawings-patterns\naround the windows and the false\nwindows enclosing the overhanging\nbalconies. The road which leads\nthrough the village is narrow, steep\nand unbelievably twisty (a great\npleasure for the real drivers!).\nMany British travel writers have\nwritten articles about Perkio, the\nplace where the myth o logia l Centaurs (half-man half-horse)\nlived. The centaurs were teachers,\nadvisors and companions of gods,\ndemigods, heroes and ordinary\nmortals, they were a symbol of\nfriendly em bu lien ce and creative\nphilosophy, but also vigorous\nun fett ed strength.\nThe history of Pelion is very\nlong. It is full of battles and\ninvasions. There is the Frankish\nperiod around 1200 AD where\nPelion became colony of Benetians.\nThe 13th and 14th centuries brought\nbloody looting raids to Pelion at the\nhands of Albanians, Catalans and\nthen Serbians. Fortunately, all those\nraids were shortly pushed back to\nthe west and north of Greece by the\nthen Byzantine emperors\nKatakouzinos and Emmanual.\nThessaly came finally under the\nunbearable lasting Turkish rule in\n1423. The monasteries and some\ntowerhouse s became nuclei for\nrebellions. After numerous\nunsuccessful revolutions Pelion and\nthe whole area of Thessaly were\nliberated and became again part of\nthe Greek state in 1878.\nFinally, during the Second World\nWar hundreds of inhabitants were\nexecuted by the Germans.\nThe following folk song is about\nthe her ioc part the women of Pelion\nplayed during the battles of 1878.\nCome out your Turks from Larissa\nand ag has from the Kastro\nTo see the war your subject Greeks\nare making,\nTo hear the Makrinitsa guns, the\nlong-armed guns\nThat burst like chestnuts and the\nag has fall,\nTo see Chronaina, daughter-in-law\nof the brave Katsouras,\nFight like a warrior by her\nchildren's side.\nTo see Souipena, for all her eighty\nyears,\nCarrying cold water to refresh our\nheroes.\nTo see Malioufena, a young girl still\nin her prime,\nShoot with her right hand, slash\nwith her left,\nThe heads of ag has fell, the bodies\nof Albanians too,\nAnd even if in our Makrinitsa the\nbattle was lost,\nOur country has won glory, honour,\nfame.\nAs Spartan women fought like men,\nAs Soulian women won fame in\nEpirus,\nSo Makrinits's women heaped\nPelion with glory.\nChris Leontopoulos,\nVP ICU Hellenic Society.\nI must profusely apologise to\nChris for the layout of his article\nlast week. I can guarantee his orders will be followed to the tee, if he can provide me with a full typeset page by Monday1 pm every week. Otherwise, could he leave these decisions to\nthose who deal with them all the\ntime. Page 1 7\n\n"

One of the guys that is\nwriting for us at the moment co-wrote the script for Terminator II.\nThe producers of the film are\nPressman and Associates who have\nproduced Wall Street at one end and\nConan the Barbarian at the other.\nThey carry the weight then with\nArnie they gave him one of his first\nbig breaks.\nFelix; Will the film revolve around\nany of the other major 2000AD characters?\nRoger; One of the scripts in\nproduction at the moment is based\naround Judge Death, the other is\nbased around a character called\nRico who was actually Judge\nDredds brother in a very early\nDredd story. Rico was bad and he\ngot sent off to Titan for 20 odd\nyears, then he came back and tried\nto kill Dredd but Dredd killed him.\nHe killed his own brother but that's just the kind of guy he is.

Price \u00a35.99\nABC Warriors in Khronicles\nof Khaos by Pat Mills and\nKevin Walker\nThe story takes place on a chaotic\nplanet, where six tough robot\nwarriors set forth to find a seventh\nmember for their team before they\nset off to break their programming\nin the search for khao s. Deadlock,\ntheir leader, believes that discipline\nand order is a disease of the mind\nso, with the help of the planet and\nits inhabitants, introduces fellow\nrobots to their equivalent of sex,\ndrugs and rock and roll. Good book\n- Read it! Price \u00a36.99\nRaptaur by Alan Grant,\ndrawn by Dean Ormston\nThe story is about an alien which\nis loose in Mega City One,\nslaughtering people where and\nwhenever it can get hold of them.\nIt is up to the Judges to stop it, using\nwhatever means they can, but it is\nnot as easy as it seems. It reminded\nme of the film Alien, 'though the\nplot isn't so complicated or as\nthrilling.

Whilst in hiding, he decides\nto have some R&R from butchering\npeople and he tells a reporter of his\nchildhood, before escaping once\nmore from Dredd. Price \u00a36.99\nDemocracy Now! by John\nWagner, drawn by Jeff\nAnderson\nThe Judges have governed Mega\nCity One for decades, keeping law\nand order by harsh and not always\nfair methods. Judges are the police\nforce and jury system all rolled into\none, thus they have the power to\narrest a criminal and sentence them\nthere and then. Resisting arrest\noften leads to being severely beaten,\nif not being shot or executed.\nHowever, within the city of 400\nmillion is a growing movement for\ndemocracy threatening to remove\nthe Judges from power. Judge\nDredd calls for a city wide\nreferendum in order that the city\ndecide whether the Judges or a democratic system should rule;\nhowever not everyone is happy with\nthe idea of democracy or with\nDredd. Price \u00a34.99\nI found the that the novels\ncontained high quality artistry and\nthat the stories were an interesting\nread. Most of the time the stories\nwere quite blood thirsty, the art\nwork showing the details to\nexplosions and decapitations very\nwell. However, cynicism and\nhumour are used excellently\nthroughout all the stories.\nGBH\nmm Page 23\n\n"

Although I know the\nUnion has no control over prices in\nQT, it does control the prices in the\nUnion Bookstore and the vending\nmachine in the Union Building.\nWhy is it that just before the\nbeginning of term there were\nMASSIVE price rises in Wispa Bar;\nFelix 944\nfrom 26p to 30p and Twix from 24p to 26p. These price rises are well\nover 10%.\nHowever, when you look at the\nBookstore a Twix is 22p, Wispa 23\nand Mars 24p.

By\nbanning it the Union just drew\nattention to it.\nFor those who missed the article\nin question I will tell you what was\nsaid.

This euphemistic\nphraseology is grotesque distortion.\nNot even the anti-abortionists'\nwarped and stunted imaginations\ncould truthfully describe themselves\nas pro life. As shown on Channel\n4 News over the summer, many\nwomen in the Irish Republic have\ndied because of complications and\nillnesses during pregnancy;\ncomplications and illnesses that\ncould not be treated because of\nIreland's oppressive anti- abortion,\nforce of the media and Western life'\nthat app rent ly stops Nobby from\nthinking about life in general.\nAccording to the Islamic society\nwhen people are down the bar we\nshould be discussing the '...most\nimportant questions like why we are\nhere, how we got here or what will\nhappen when we die?'\nApparently the Western culture is\nbrain dead and '...Islam provides\nthe answer to solving the world's problems in one fell swoop.'\nWell there you go, you just\ncouldn't make it up! How I wonder\nwould they solve the problems of\nthe Middle East? Or the problem of\nthe homelessness. They'd probably\nhave them all publicly executed!\nThis, from the lot that treat women\nas second class citizens. That, in\nanti-life laws.\nI hope that the British antiabortion groups will keep their\nmurky fingers and diseased\nmentalities out of the current\nabortion referenda campaign in\nIreland, something they failed to do\nin the past. I also hope that they will\ncondemn the antics of militant Irish\nanti-abortionists, who not only hold\nKu Klux Klan gatherings outside\nIrish women MPs' homes, but also\npicket Dublin airport and verbally\nabuse pregnant women flying to\nEngland. This type of behaviour is\nmorally repugnant.\nName withheld by request.\ncountries like Saudi Arabia, refuse\nto let their women even drive and\nmake them walk about with their\nfaces covered up.

    "content": "Felix 944\nReviews16 th October 1992\nMooosic\nThe K Creative\u2014Question\nEverything Done\nI'm worried. I can see it all now is\nclinging lycra and crumpled shell\nsuit. A little boutique somewhere\nalong Oxford Street. The nosebleed Belgian 'ard core ceases. They\nplay a mellow track. Still up front,\nstill trendy. After all if they play it\non Kiss Fm it must be good.\nProblem is, nobody listens, ever.\nMassive Attack's 'Blue Lines'\nsprings to mind. Remembered for\nthe dancy, chart y 'Unfinished\nSympathy', not the masterful excess\nof 'Hymn of the Big Wheel'. It is\nso refreshing to hear a group with\nStyle but not A Style. Its not that\ntrends are a problem, some of the\npeople that follow them like sheep\nare.\nThis is not a masterpiece. Rather\nit is the start of what should be a rather momentous career.\nPeb\n\u2022 Out now on Talkin' Loud. We\nhave some money-off\nvouchers kick in' around the office\nif you want one. K Creative play\nQueen Mary College tomorrow,\nSouth Bank Uni on Thursday and\nUCL on 30th. Neneh Cherry\u2014Money Love Radiohead \u2014Creep ep\nStrange words Money and Love put\ntogether yet many say they are\ninseparable, an interesting view\n(OK, I 'll cut the crap). Getting back\nto the record, the tune didn't even\nstick in my head which makes me\neither deaf or the song average\n(possibly both!). That being said, I seem to remember hearing it on\nMTV a few times so it can't be (or\ncan it?). Anyway, it sure doesn't pack it like 'Raw like Sushi's'( the\nlast album) songs did. Not specially\ncherish able stuff (ARRG).\nMoo Co. Ltd.\n\u2022 Out now on Circa. The album\n'Homebrew' is released on October\n26.\nWhen I played this ep I thought it\nwas so good that I rushed out to buy\nit, before I realised that I already\nhad it, so I didn't need to buy it. So\nI came back and played it again. It\nstarted off mellow with 'creep' and\niur gee' so I lit some incense and\nmellowed out before jumping\naround the room when 'Inside My\nHead' and 'Million Dollar\nQuestion' came on.\n'Million Dollar Question' was my\nfave track\u2014slightly reminiscent of\nthe Stuffies whilst still remaining\noriginal and fresh.\nThis ep is excellent\u2014get it.\nLily.\n\u2022 OUt now on Parlophone.\nSuzanne Vega: 99.9FI'd like to say I hated it, you'd like\nto hear I hated it and.. .1 enjoyed it\n(sorry). Sure, it wasn't raptures of\necstatic delight, but that's not what\nthe album's all about anyway. It's a calm record and it makes a change\nfrom 'In the corner of the corner,\nther's a corner that's a corner'\n(a.k.a. 'Tom's Diner'). The\nacoustic guitar has replaced the\ndrum machine and Suzanne's voice\nhas replaced the sampled vocals. So\nmuch for the style, what about the\ncontent? Well, as always, it ranges\nfrom mediocre to not bad. Nothing\nmind blowing but nothing you'd have to fast forwards past\n(especially difficult on a vinyl). I especially enjoyed 'Fat man and\ndancing Girl' and 'In Liverpool'\nthat being the first single released\nfrom the album. The kind of record\nyou fall asleep to, but in a pleasant\nslumber rather than a bored snooze.\nMoo Co. Ltd \u2022 Out now on A&M. The 4 Of Us \u2014Man Alive\nThis is the first release by Irish band\nThe 4 Of Us for two years\u2014their\nlast ep 'Baby Jesus' reached the the\ntop 3 in the Irish charts. They've\njust completed a short UK tour and\nhad a few gigs in the US before that.\n'Man Alive' is the title single from\ntheir new album which will be\nreleased shortly.\nThe album version (on the B side)\nis catchy and lyrical and bodes well\nfor the quality of their forthcoming\nalbum.\nThe two mixes on the other hand\nare long and tedious\u2014the first is a seven minute dance mix of the song\nand the second is nine minutes long\nand is just a repetitive sample of the\nwords 'don't stop'. So you might as\nwell just wait for the album to come\nout to get the decent version of\n'Man Alive'.\nLily\n\u2022 Out now on Columbia/Sony.\nFrontline Assembly\u2014 Blade\nIf you're after a stirring electro-beat\nwith no concessions, Frontline\nAssembly take no prisoners with\ntheir latest album 'Blade'. This\nmakes the most severe Shaman look\nlike a simpering cissy. The whole\nis a violent onslaught of the latest\ntechnology, which rattles the bars\nof rigid hardcore cells.\nHowever, this is nothing new to\nFrontline Assembly. Any of the\neight tracks is fully re pre se native of\nany of their albums\u2014no catchy\ntunes, just a concept. Hey! didn't we review this one back in '89?\nIf you're a fan, it's another\nvariation to grace your airwaves. If\nyou're not, find out why it's still\nselling after all this ageless time.\nShe Who Shall Remain\nNameless\n\u2022 Out now on Third Mind.\nSiouxsie & The Banshees\u2014\nTwice Upon A Time LP\nWell, what a week this is with three\nsinister releases. It was time for\nFelix to dust the crypt and revive\nthe ancients.\nSo, in the beginning, there was\nSiouxsie. And Siouxsie was\nDarkness. And then the Manager\nsaid let there be more. And lo, she\ncreated. Siouxsie is eternal and has\nmetamorphosed to fit her\nenvironment. She listens to what is\nh app 'nin, so writes The Tune for\nBatman Returns. She releases\nANOTHER compilation and we\nadore her.\n'Twice Upon A Time' is the\npinnacles of her career, the\nmelodies that have kept her Great.\nThe Young Gods \u2014Kilburn\nNational Ballroom\nApparently, The Young Gods are\ngreat. Judging by the queue outside\nthe venue, they could well be. Even\nSteve Mack of That Petrol Emotion\ncan'tb lag his way in on the guest\nlist, they're that popular. (Either\nthat or Steve Mack has failed to\nrealise that he is a rock nobody\nthese days...What do you mean, he\n1\nalways was!). Meat Beat Manifesto\ndo the honours as support. That's about all they do though. No\nCharisma. No Presence. No Talent.\nNo Thanks.\nAt around 10.20 The Young\nGods take the stage to a wild frenzy\nof stage diving and incredible noise.\nBy 10.30 I have made my first\ndiscovery...The Young Gods are\nutter bollocks!\nMy second discovery? There's a tube at 10.40 that takes you swiftly\nand safely back to Baker Street.\nMcCarter\nThe double album commences\nwhere 'Once Upon A Time' left us\nstranded. From 'Swimming Horses'\nto 'Dazzle' this is the album for us\nminions bemused by the plethora of\nSiouxsie albums. This is our\nterrifyingly serene Queen.\nThe second disk sees a more\nmature and varied vein. No one\ncould forget 'Peek-a Boo',\nlightened by her toe-tapping\n'Passenger' and 'This Wheel's On\nFire'. The compilation is concluded\nwith releases from Suspicion and\nher ultimate 'Face to Face', the\nterrifyingly serene theme from\nBatman Returns. Buy it and be\nen awed. She Who Shall Remain\nNameless\n\u2022 Out now on Polydor.\nThe 4 of Us: Don't just stand there, GET IN FOCUS!\nPage 19\n\n"

    "content": "'eat ure16 th October 1992 Felix 944\nFreedom in a plastic bag?\nEmma Keeling explores the newfound freedom of the first female\ncondom\nIn America, women didn't like it\nbecause it required too much\ntouching, but the makers are\nconfident that British women will\nhave no such qualms. This\nsupposition seems to be true as\nBoots in Earls Court report that\nFemidom, the new female condom\nis selling exceptionally well.\nWhether this is just because they are\na novelty has yet to be seen.\nThe first thing that struck me was\nthe size of the box, which is hardly\ndiscreet at over 5\" long and over\n3 1/2\" wide (bigger than two packs\nof cigarettes). Not the sort of thing\nthat you could carry about in your\nwallet. The second thing that\nshocked me was the price, \u00a33.95 for\nthree, which hardly compares\nfavourably with male condoms.\nSo how can the female condom\nclaim to be an improvement on the\nmethods of contraception already\navailable? Chartex International,\nwho manufacture Femidom, claim\nthat it is 'the first contraceptive'\nproduct for women which provides\nprotection against both pregnancy\nand sexually-transmitted diseases.'\nThis may be true but a condom will\ndo this job too. It is also supposed\nto be 'soft and comfortable to use'\nand able to be inserted 'as quickly\nand easily as a tampon.' I had to see\nif these claims were true.\nOnce you have got over the shock\nof the price and the box size, then\nyou have to cope with the look of\nthe 'product' (as the informative\nleaflet you get in the box refers to\nthe condom.) It is a7\" long seamed\ntube with a flexible ring at the top\nwith a diameter of over 3 1/2\" and\na smaller ring which is meant to go\nat the bottom, although it is\ncompletely removable for some\nreason.\nThe instructions suggest you\n'might find it useful to practice on\nyour own' if it the first time you\nhave tried Femidom and 'once you\nfeel comfortable about inserting\nFemidom, you can try using it with\nyour partner' but at \u00a33.95 for three\nI wasn't prepared to waste any.\nThe instruction leaflet was\nstrangely reminiscent of a Tampax\nleaflet and you need a degree to\nunderstand it. It certainly brought\nhumour into the sexual experience.\nTrying to maintain my tenuous\ngrasp on the inner ring to keep it\nsqueezed together for ease of\ninsertion, when it was covered with\nvery slimy plastic, was extremely\ndifficult. And even when you have\nfinished groping around inside\nyourself, you still have some of the\ncondom and the outer ring sticking\nout of your vagina, which is\nsomewhat of a passion-killer. My\npartner said T was reminded of\nmaking love to a sink plunger.'\nHowever, once it was inserted\nand intercourse commenced, things\nseemed to be getting better until he\nwithdrew and the whole contraption\ncame out with him. Not the best\nthing to happen, especially as we\nhadn't finished. In the end we\nabandoned the Femidom and\ncontinued without it; not a very\nsuccessful experiment!\nBecause it is so new there are no\nreliable figures on how effective the\nfemale condom is, either as a contraceptive or as a protection\nagainst AIDS or other STDs,\nthough the leaflet ventures it is\n'extremely effective'. This method\nof contraception doesn't provide\nany protection for oral or anal sex\nas a condom would do.\nWHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT OF\nTHE NEW F EMI DOM7 wouldn't trust anything with a seam in it. '\n'Chance would be a fine thing.'\n'Looks even grosser than a condom. '\n'You can't even blow them up like\na condom. '\n'I wouldn't use it it has\nabsolutely no appeal whatsoever. '\n'It would definitely kill the mood.'\nWhile your union president had the\nfollowing to say; 'A bit naughty\nlooking int it' !?\nTHOSE WHO HAD ACTUALLY USED THE DEVISE HAD VARYING OPINIONS:\n'It was like trying to wallpaper the\ninside of a jam jar' !\n'It tastes of blended vegetable oil'\n'Very comfortable and better to use\nthan a condom but far too difficult\nto put in. '\nThe Femidom and its packaging compared to the standard\nmale condom (pictured bottom right)\nIN A MINITURE SURVEY OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE, FELIX\nFOUND THAT THE QUALITIES OF THE FEMIDOM COULD BE SUMMARIZED BELOW;\nPLUS POINTS:\n* Virtually odour less and tasteless.\n* Improved sensitivity, compared to a condom.\n* Can be inserted before the penis is erect so that it doesn't interrupt intercourse.\nMINUS POINTS:\n* Big bulky boxes, difficult to carry about.\n* Expensive & not available free from the Family Planning\nClinic at the moment.\n* Advisable'to use extra lubrication - increased expense and\ninconvenience.\n* Doesn't contain a spermicide, such as Nonoxyl 9 which\nmay help prevent AIDS.\n* Difficult to insert.\n* May be pushed completely inside if insufficiently\nlubricated.\nPage 12\n\n"

Ray\nis one-quarter Indian; being\naccepted as 'American', he has\nalways tried to hide this.\nThe film tracks Ray's progress in\nthe investigation. When he\nwitnesses the callousness with\nwhich the Bureau is handling the\ncase and begins to sense corruption,\nhis loyalty starts to shift from the\nFBI to 'his own people'.\nThis thriller is long but well\npaced: the action being interleaved\nwith stunning photography of the\nregion and scenes and comments\ndesigned to indicate some of the\nproblems that Indians face. Its\nimpact is somewhat reduced by\noften portraying the Indians as\n'magical mystics' but it's enjoyable\nand worth watching.\nDances with Wolves seems to\nhave started a trend. Maybe films\nfeaturing 'Red Indians' will\ncontinue being made until the\nAmericans satisfy their conscience\nthat they've paid back for stealing\nThunderheart\nland by making these sympathetic\nfilms, and stop paying to see them;\ni.e. the plight of the Indians will be\nrecognised as long as it makes\nmoney.\nAR Khan.\n\u2022 Opens Friday at MGM Fulham\nRoad and around London.\nBitter Moon\nAn amazing atmospheric roller-coaster, this movie bounces the\nviewer through sympathies,\ndislikes, shared fear and pure\nshock. Emmanuelle Seigner, film\ndirector Polanski's wife, plays\nburning French girl Mimi opposite\nPeter Coyote in the role of Oscar,\nan unsuccessful American writer.\nTravelling aboard a luxury ship,\nthe pair play an awesome\npsycho logia l game where they trap\na stereotyped stuck-up English\ncouple into the intimacy and horrors\nof their most private relationship.\nOscar gradually reveals how their\nexperiences brought them from\necstatic love to addictive intimate\nhatred, passing through numerous\nsexual games and perversions\n(some on screen!), finally almost\ndestroying both of them.\nAt times funny and frightening,\nthe plot takes unexpected twists,\nconstantly adjusting the pressure\nuntil it is hardly bearable. It\nvapor is es yuppie-style confidence\nand sense of emotional security.\nThe often excellent camera work\nand sinister soundtrack by Vangelis\ncontribute to creating a strangling\natmosphere. Not for borderline\npsychos or sensitive souls...\nTex Crocky\n*Bitter Moon is currently\nplaying at the Chelsea Cinema, the\nGate Notting Hill, the Odeon\nKensington and around London.\nBeauty and the Beast\nOne does not expect depth in an\nanimated Disney film, and\nfollowing the tenet that to be\nfor warned is to be forearmed, I managed to expect nothing but\nschmalzy tears and predictable\nmorals, and thus I did enjoy it. The\nfilm conforms to all the Disney\nformulae - facile and effective\ncharacter is tion, immediately\nplacing the Goodies, the Baddies,\nthe Amusing Incidental Characters\nand the Tragic Figure. All set in an\nover-the-top rustic Bavarian\ncountryside. The expected and\nappeal ingly slapdash visual humour\nis there as well as the subtler jokes\nfor the grownups like, for instance,\nthe rather bittersweet advice given\nto the wooing Beast of the title on\nhow to win a woman; 'give her\nthings like flowers, chocolates,\npromises you don't intend to\nkeep....'\nIf you want a superficially\namusing and attractive way to spend\nsome time, this is for you. We all\nknow what Disney films are like -don't convince yourself of anything\ndifferent and you will enjoy this\nfilm. It's one of Disney's better and\n4 t fc ft,\nBeauty and the Beast\nit's great fun.\nAdam Harrington.\n^Beauty and the Beast opens\ntoday around London.\nConcert\nMitsuko Uchida \u2014 Barbican\nThe complete lack of musical\ninsight shown by this Beethovenmedal-winner was astounding. As\never, publicity triumphing over\nmediocrity, provided her with a full\nhouse. She attacks the unsuspecting\nresident Steinway, not the\nmellowest of instruments at its best,\nas though it had keys of concrete.\nUchida harangued us with the\nfastest, loudest, most percussive\nrendition of Schumann's lyric,\nchildlike 'Carnival' I have ever had\nthe misfortune to hear.\nShe then proceeded to rip through\nBeethoven's sonata op 90, which,\nlike all Beethoven should be treated\nwith reverence, precision and\ndynamic subtlety instead, pedalling\nphrases to a matted obscurity we\nwere presented with a jarring,\ndiscordant mess. What a depressing\nexperience.\nS. A. OMitsuko Uchida played at the\nBarbican Concert Hall last Sunday.\nPage 24\n\n"

When the\nchange was first proposed, Sir Eric\nAsh, College Rector, said that the\nchange was for administrative\nreasons, and that it would not lead\nto an increase in the number of\nnecessary to secure the planned\nnumber of bar extensions for this\nyear.

Civil Engineering\nstudents have found themselves\nscheduled to attend four consecutive\nlectures. MrC J Kerr, the\nDepartmental Administrator, said\nthat this arrangement was inevitable\ndue to the structuring of third year\noptions and that it was the only way\nto 'satisfy the needs of a number of\nstudents' wishing to take certain\noptions.\nMr Kerr added that the\nscheduling of Humanities\nDepartment options for 1pm effectively reduced the number of\navailable morning contact hours to\ntwo. Mr Kerr expects this problem\nto be clarified at the next Civil\nEngineering Staff Student\nCommittee meeting, by which time\nexact student numbers for each\ncourse will be known. Mr Kerr\nadded that the College is on a 'learning curve' when dealing with\nthe new College Day.\nThe Humanities Department is\npermitted to timetable options\nduring the College lunch hour on\nevery day except Wednesday. This\nis reportedly causing difficulties for\nclubs and societies attempting to\nschedule lunchtime meetings. After\nrepresentations from Imperial\nCollege Union Rag, the Physics\nDepartment agreed to move lectures\noriginally scheduled for Friday\nlunchtime.

One group\nascended to the mountain refuge hut\nfrom the bottom of the valley via\nlarge quantities of loose s cree, while a second group drove the van\nup a mountain road and took a shorter route to the refuge from\nwhere they further ascended le\nTaillon (3144m) which gave them\nremarkable views of the entire\nPyrenee mountain chain. Two\nmasochistic members combined the\nwalks and ascended le Taillon from\nthe bottom of the valley (about\n1350m above sea level).\nAfter an interesting night's sleep\nin the refuge (this is a eup hen is m) the group climbed further up the\ns cree slopes, through the Breche\nand into Spain.\nThe group split up with some\nmembers ascending Pic du Marbore\n(3248m), the highest peak on the\nrim of the Cirque. The photo shows\nsome of the s cree and ice slopes\ncrossed in the course of this walk.\nDuring a high-velocity descent of an\nice slope several members sustained\nminor injuries too embarrassing to\ndetail. The day ended with the\ngroup invading a restaurant where\nmuch food and wine was consumed.\nFriday was a rest day starting\nwith a shopping trip from where we\ncontinued to Lowdes. Most of the\ngroup got soaking wet walking\nround various articles of religious\ninterest while the other one went to\nPortugal, where it didn't rain.\nOn Saturday those who had not\nyet ascended le Taillon did so, while\nthe rest of the group tackled Mont\nPerdu, the highest peak of the trip\nat 3355m. Take it from those who\nknow; it was knacker ing. After hanging around Luz St\nSauveur on Sunday morning we\nproceeded to the culinary highlight\nof the trip: a visit to an authentic\nBasque goat's cheese farm. After\nthree odorous hours we finally got\nwhat we went for: the free cheese\nand wine, very good it was, too.\nOn Monday we packed up and\nheaded north to Beaugency, to the\nyouth hostel there, and on Tuesday\nonwards to Calais.\nBy Tuesday night many of us\nwere to be found in the Union Bar.\nA mediocre end to an otherwise\nexcellent trip. Next year: the\nHimalayas in four days?\nIf any of this appeals to you,\ncontact R Richards (Aero 2) or see\nus in Southside Upper Lounge on\nThursday at 12.30p m.R Harpin, P Davison.\n\"he islands of Indonesia\nEmeralds of the equator. This\nbeautiful phrase aptly describes the\ngeography of Indonesia. Located on\nthe hemisphere line of our globe\nspanning 3,000 miles of ocean from\neast to west are 13,000 islands,\ncollectively known as the\nIndonesian archipelago. Most of\nthem are abundantly covered by\nluscious green tropical forests,\nhome for a rich variety of\nvegetation and wildlife. From giant\nRafflesia Arnoldi, the biggest\nflower in the world, to immaculate\nwild orchids and from one-horned\nrhinos that roam the westernmost\npart of Jawa island to c ender a was ih of Irian Jaya, the paradise bird.\nSurrounded by the sea the\narchipelago boasts a warm sunny\nclimate which is made pleasant by\nthe ocean breeze. Most parts of\nIndonesia are mou taino us with\nbeautiful mountain scenery and\ndramatic lakes and cliffs. Many of\nthose mountains are active\nvolcanoes, making the land fertile\nand ideal for farming.\nIndonesia ranks as the fourth\nmost populous country in the world\nwith a population of over 180\nmillion. The people inhabit over\n3,000 islands, the main ones being\nJawa, Sumatra, Malimantan,\nSulawesi and Irian Jaya. They come\nfrom hundreds of ethnic groups and\nspeak around 200 different\nlanguages. To communicate freely\nthey speak Bahasa Indonesia, the\nnational language.\nCultural and religious diversity\nhas always been an integral part of\nIndonesian society. However, they\nhave a tolerant attitude which assists\nthem to live harmoniously side by\nside and form a colourful national\nmosaic. The character is fittingly\ncontained in the national motto,\n'Unity in Diversity'. Apart from\nlanguage, the cultural diversity\nmanifests itself in architecture,\nmusic, traditional dance, paintings\nand sculpture. The traditional\nfamily house of West Sumatra,\nknown as rum a hg a dang, is one\nexample of fine Indonesian\narchitecture with its distinctive\nhorn-shaped roofs. Dynamic\nBalinese dances, full of religious\nrituals and symbolism, have\nenchanted so many visitors.\nJavanese batik paintings are well\nknown world wide. Wood\nsculptures are abundant, with\ndifferent regions exhibiting unique\ncharacteristics.\nThe Republic of Indonesia\nbecame a sovereign state in 1945\nafter several centuries of Dutch\ncolonisation. Members of\nParliament are elected every five\nyears during a General Election, the\nlast was held in the middle of this\nyear.\nThe main source of income used\nto be oil and other natural\nresources. However, the nation has\nbeen trying to develop other, more\nreliable ways to generate wealth.\nOne such attempt is tourism. It is\na curious fact that Indonesia is not\nwell known despite it being the\nlargest archipelago in the world and\nthe fourth largest nation on earth.\nPerhaps because of its sheer size\nand diversity, many people are only\naware of a tiny part of Indonesia,\nlike Bri. Encouragingly, though,\nmore parts of the vast country are\nnow beginning to emerge in the eye\nof world tourism and with its warm\nwelcome, breathtaking scenery and\nan intriguing blend of cultures and\ntraditions the nation is confident that\nit has much to offer to visitors in\nthe coming years. As one old\nIndonesian proverb says 'tak ken al maka tak sayang', meaning we do\nnot love something until we know\nit well. Therefore, we hope you\nenjoy this evening and leave with\na knowledge and love of our\ncountry. 'Selamat Menikmati'.\nPage 16\n\n"

PWEI; featuring Clint 'no relation' Mansell.\nThe Family Cat\u2014River of\nDiamonds (12\")\nThe last time I heard The Family\nCat was when they were playing at\none of the fresher s' parties last year,\nand if you weren't there\u2014GET A LIFE. But having said that, you\ndidn't miss much because they were\nshite.\nAnyway getting over my initial\nhang ups and actually listening to it\n'River of Diamonds' is surprisingly\nOK, swirling guitars and cool\nvocals but certainly didn't deserve\nto be the title track.\n'Sandbag Of Your Heart' is much\nbetter with anger and attitude just\noozing out of the record. An intense\nmixture of fuzzy, feed backing guitars and solid vocals makes it\neasily the best track. But as an\noverall concept there's nothing but\nblandness.\nFinal track on that ominous other\nside, 'Tom Verlaine' (yes, a Television reference!) sounds\nvaguely Bfur-ish but with more\nangry guitar playing. Quite possibly\nthe TV (Tom Verlaine, Television)\ninfluence, but too middle-of-the-road (i.e. shite).\nI couldn't help noticing 'vocal\nconcept courtesy of Polly Harvey'\nscrawled on the back cover, and\nthought why did PJ 'You leave me\nso dry' Harvey associate herself\nwith such an a ff band?\nAnyway overall the attitude's sound, but in terms of potential,\nthey have about as much of it as a bottle of flat coke.\nLucas\n\u2022 Out now on Dedicated.\nStare\u2014Mood ep\nI 've never heard anything by this\nband before and judging by this\npromo I 'll be a very happy man if\nI don't hear a fucking peep out of\nthem again! This may have been\npop-kid heaven a while back but\nyou can only have so many\nKingmakers and the like. I dunno,\nmaybe Stare are still trying to pull\nall the girls they used to play in\nfront of in the school hall!\nStare are one of those bands\nwhere the few bits you like you're\nsure you've heard elsewhere, mind\nyou the same could be said for most\nof the bits that fuck you off as well!\nBoth musically and lyrically the ep\nis uninspiring with the title track\nwinning the prize for being the most\ninstantly forgettable.\nOf the three tracks 'No Way' is\nthe one that pisses me off the most\nfor being one of those Generation\nTerrorists tracks. You know the\ntype 'it's all the old bastards' faults,\nmind you daddy did fork out a grand for this lovely guitar and\namp'. Yeah, go talk some sense you\ntw at s: it's really shite trying to\nmimic the Manics!\nAt various points on the final\ntrack, 'Prince of Wales Rd', the\nband manage to sound like a poor\nman's Cure but even this is let down\nby the weak vocals present\nthroughout the ep. Maybe trying\ns orn,e thing different could help this\nband (like bribing the reviewers),\nbut who am I to judge?\nIf eve there was a band who could\ndrive me Stare-crazy, this is the\none.\nJon Knight\nPop Will Eat Itself,\nEat, Scorpio Rising\nBrixton Academy, 10/10/92\nLet's face it. Concerts are meant to\nbe LOUD. When they're not loud,\nthey don't feel right. And Scorpio\nRising aren't loud tonight. So they\ndon't feel right. I think that's the\nproblem. And the lack of dry ice.\nAnd the relative containment of the\nstrobes. It's just not right, okay?\nEat will pop itself. Yes, very\nfunny, Ange, now get your kit off.\nAnd stop throwing CDs at me.\nThey can be quite a shock when\nyou're just standing there, strain g at the fairy lights on the drum kit, when a huge volley of CDs comes\nracing through the skies. Still, it's nice to see 'Golden Egg' returning\nto the set after its recent holiday in\nthe South of France.\n... And then it all went dark. The\ncurtain falls, and at last a half decent\nlight show kicks in to full effect. But\nPWEI seem intent on denying their\npast. However un savoury it might\nseem, it's still theirs. And while\nthey give a pretty, pretty\nperfunctory run through of all of\ntheir new album, there's precious\nlittle else; to be precise, two from\n'Cure For Sanity', three from 'This\nIs This' and a solitary 'There Is No\nLove'. Considering that they now\nhave four albums worth of material,\na more varied set would not go\namiss. Are they ashamed of their\nprevious work, now that the blame\nfor creating EMF and the obnoxious\n25th Of May lies fairly and squarely\non their shoulders?

Inspired use of lighting\nand some surprisingly good\nmadrigal singing instantly conjured\nan atmosphere of peace and\nprivilege shocking in its stark\ncontrast to the nightmare of\npoverty, impatience and mass\nproduction that is supposed to\nconstitute an adequate education.\nPoint made\u2014could do better\nthough.\nSara\nGallery\nRichard Serra \u2014Drawings\nand Dan Graham\nRichard Serra is one of 'America's most celebrated and controversial\nartists', although I 'll admit I 've\nnever heard of him. The exhibition\nis supposed to 'confound our\nexpectations by reinventing the\nmedium' according to the gallery's flyer. Reinventing in this case\nmeans taking a whitewashed room\nand sticking a large black canvas on\none wall. You've probably gathered\nby this point that I didn't like this\nexhibition.\nMoving swiftly on to Dan\nGraham, another contemporary\nAmerican artist. His piece, titled\n'Two-Way Mirror and Hedge\nLabyrinth' can be found on the lawn\nnear the gallery's entrance. The title\ngives the game away with this one,\nthe sculpture is an arrangement of\nhedges and panes of glass. The\nglass reflects the hedges forming a small labyrinth. What I really liked\nwas the way the trees on the other\nside of the glass had a ghostly\nappearance, like looking through\nmist. Go and give this one a try.\nRobert Morgan\n\u2022 Serpentine Gallery, Hyde Park,\n10am6 pm, admission free.\nOpera\nThe Glyndebourne Touring\nOpera \u2014Le Nozze Di Figaro\nThe first thing I must say is that the\nperformance of this rather famous\npiece was absolutely amazing. A simple set on stage, bright costumes\nand what's more large electronic\nslide subtitles above the stage made\nit a very enjoyable evening. The\nplot is very complicated to explain\nin less than 150 words but while\nyou're watching it is very easy to\nfollow. The whole cast put in a powerful and emotional\nperformance. I was most impressed\nby Julie Unwin, who played the part\nof a page\u2014desperately seeking love\nfrom any appropriate woman. I would heavily recommend anyone\nwho is interested in opera to attempt\nto see this production. A memorable night.\nSam.\n\u2022 Sadlers Wells Theatre, phone\n071-278 8916.
