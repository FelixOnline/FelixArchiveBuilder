    "content": "10 Feedback Felix \u2022 1 November 1999\nPoint\nSome of you may have noticed that\nI wasn't here last week. Giving my social conscience its annual outing,\nI went up to Cambridge to deliver a friendly rap on the knuckles about the price of Chinese take-aways.\nNaturally, the local bobbies repressed me brutally and locked me in prison, evidently concerned for President Jiang' s fragile mental\nstate. Slightly peeved, I returned to London only to find that after yet\nanother constitutional rewrite, ICU has modelled itself on the People's Republic.\nFollowing the benign and pleasant rule of President He l'ad, the communists have installed President Ta'sha to run the People's Union.( That's not the only coincidence: in 1 9 9 7 , a largely success-ful, yet tiny colony was consumed by\nits gigantic neighbour and changed to an administrative region). Now it\nwould seem that Minister for Cul ture Jin Quin't ri is seeking to sup press dissenting voices in the name of ' The People', in order to establish\nhis own succession to rule.\nHow very well timed this all is.\nLast week, the government announced a bill which will finally\ngive you the right not to read any files that College keeps on you; last\nweek, the Foreign Office instructed\nyour police force to suppress peaceful democratic protest in\norder to protect trade; and last\nweek, members of the Union Executive decided to use their influence\nto suppress opinions that differed\nfrom their own. Let's make it clear: this column will remain anonymous in spite of\npathetic bleating from una c co un table hacks. Without anonymity, it\ncannot be written. If people knew I wrote Breakpoint, they'd either tell\nme nothing, or tell me a load of\ntrash. Many letters to Felix are unsigned, and the opinions given\nare often more sensible than those\nof the egotists who simply wish to see their name in print. This column is subject to the approval of the\nFelix Editor, in exactly the same way as any letter is. The Felix Editor is,\nby the way, David Roberts, not our Minister of Culture, or anyone else\nfor that matter.\nFor those of you unsure, BreakPoint has come about as a result of\ndesperation at the apathy shown by\nyour typical IC student. ICU has\ngreat powers and influence at\nImperial, and it scares me to think\nof it being used without open debate holding our' elected' officers to account. So Breakpoint aims\nto start that debate, in the lecture\ntheatres, in Southside and the sports\nfields. No leader writer in Fleet\nStreet signs their columns; if you don't agree with them, you either\nput up or shut up. The same applies\nhere.\nWhy is it so important to know\nwho BreakPoint is? If you did know,\ndoubtless the replies to my column would not tackle the substance of\nthe debate, but merely be personal\ninsults - and that gets us nowhere\nfast.\nSo until the editor gives me my\nmarching orders, you'll find me here sharing this page with Kevin.\nI 'll keep raking the lawn and revealing any hidden treasures I may find.\nFor your part, I hope you keep\nreading, and aim to discover the\ntruth for yourself.\nOh, and by the way for those\nof you who said my first column( Felix 1 1 5 2 ) was made up non sense, I commend you to read Tim Trailor's quote on last weeks front\npage: \"There's also a plan to ratio-na lise the sports grounds. That suggests that they plan to sell Teddingt on\". I thank you. ABSENTEE MASCOTRY\nTheta, currently the only violate Constituent College Union mascot at Imperial, did not attend all of the Royal College of Science Freshers dinners.\nKevin, hoping to find intriguing stories of an ingenious theft, covered up by the R CSU has been investigating. The best excuse the twenty\nthousand pounds worth of thermometer could come up with, was that it was away from college getting polished. Kevin sees this as about as pathetic as : \"Sorry .. I can't come, I'm doing my\nhair.\"\nHARD TO COMMENT\nThe Senior Common Room( SCR), and sur-rounding a reason the first floor of Sherfield are to be refurbished. Estates has expressed concern at the lack of comments on the plans that they\nhave received from staff and students. Kevin\nthinks he may have an explanation, other than\ntypical IC apathy. At the time of writing Kevin\nnotices that e mails to s cr comment s@ic.a c.uk, the address to which comments were invited, are\nbouncing. A recent article in staff newsletter ICDistorter\nalso stated that details could be viewed from www.ad.ic.ac.uk/estates, yet the page is still\nawaiting the appropriate link.\nJACK HAMMER ATTACK\nEstates have stated that they are keen to keep\nnoise and disruption to a minimum during the\nS CR project, which will run from directly after\nChristmas, to the end of June. Those responsible\nare evidently aware of fears of a repeat of the\ndebacle that accompanied the Library extension\nMish\nMash\nA Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nwhich resulted in students taking exams in a tent\noutside Southside and have stated that \"students\nshould not fear noise during exams\". To ensure they have evidence to backup their statements contractors with jack hammers have been drilling into walls around Sherfield to see the effect on the Great Hall. Kevin was not\nencouraged by the fact lectures in the Reed and Pippard Lecture Theatres were disrupted by noises similar to jack hammers during the week of the tests.\nPRICE WAR HERE WE COME\nThe ICU run newsagents on the walkway will\nrelocate to the J CR temporarily from January\nduring the S CR works. Students and Staff will be faced with a choice between QT' s, and the ICU outlet, which will be situated opposite each other. Kevin encourages students to choose ICU, as profits benefit students, rather than being\nswallowed by Sherfield. The Union newsagents is\nof course superior to QT: it will remain the only\none with newspapers and magazines, and is also\ncheaper on standard lines such as drinks and crisps. \" ' . i iS MW Sl<i THE MILLENNIUM HAMSTER\nThe huge Millennium Wheel on the bank of the\nThames is now visible from parts of college. Kevin was disappointed to learn that Imperial\nBiologists are not involved in the creation of the\nhuge Millennium Hamster that will be evidently\nbe required to power it.\nTo comment or contribute:\nhttp://come.to/mishmash\n\n"

Although this too passed without any\nnotable incident it could prove memorable in future years as the last ever\nBall of it's type. A thorough review is\ncurrently underway to examine whether the Union can truly support\nboth this event and the Summer Ball\n(for more details see this week's State\nof the Union on page9). In Brief\nCHARING CROSS SALE\nRumours have been flying round the\noffice' of Union hacks all week\nregarding a possible shake up at\nCharing Cross library.\nAlthough nothing concrete has\nbeen said the official line is that the\nadministration are\" reviewing space\" with a possible view to mo ving two floors of journals and peri-odi cal s down to the basement of the\nmain building into the space that is\ncurrently occupied by the Union. Primary Care would most likely\ntake over the space left.\nNatasha Newton, Union President, and Becky England, ICS MSU President, are planning to meet with\nthe administration at Charing X on the 2 9 th to get a better idea of what\nis happening. It is unlikely that either St Mary's or Chelsea and Westminster' s library s will be subjected to similar\nreviews.\nWAIVERS WAR\nAccording to the AUT last Monday was a WOW day. It formed part of\nthe campaign against university staff\nhaving to routinely sign away their\nemployment rights. The WipeOut Waivers day coincided with the\nrelease of the Employment Relations\nAct1999. The AUT have now pushed for current waivers signed\nby staff to be revoked. The general\nsecretary of the Association commented \"This is an issue of fairness.\nNo staff in Higher Education should ever be obliged to sigh away their\nemployment rights.\"\nC& GU NIGHT BOMBS City & Guilds Union held their\nthemed Star Wars night last Friday\nin the J CR. It was intended to\nreplace last year's boat party which flopped in spectacular fashion. The engineers organised a casino, disco, bar and a big screen playing\nthe entire series of Lucas' space opera. Despite an impressive poster\ncampaign featuring Tarantinoe s que misquotes the event was reported to have flopped with only\n3 5 - 4 0 people turning up. The C& GU President, Dines hG an esa rajah, admitted the event had made a loss of \u00a3 3 6 6 , and could offer no explanation for the low turnout. He did not think the \u00a3 5\nticket price or the high male-female\nratio in Guilds was to blame and added that the people present\nseemed to have enjoyed the night.\n\" We may have suffered a minor setback, but it is hardly significant in\nview of C& GU's largest venture this\nterm, the Freshers Dinner\" commented Mr. Gan esa rajah. \"This\nevent has a strong reputation and is\na perfect introduction to this Union. Iam confident we will not see a repeat of the Stars Wars night and the pre-sale bookings are giving\nearly indication of yet another storming night.\"\nACCESS TO WORK The restrictions on international students working while studying in the\nUK have been eased. Overseas students who are not nationals of\nthe European Economic Area are no longer required to individually\nobtain the permission of the Secretary of State for Education and Employment. The assessment of students'\nfinancial means by UK immigration has also been altered. Part-time\nwork at a higher or further e duc ation institute is not taken into consideration "

The songs Kewpies Like\nWatermelon and Slain By Elf\nhave a lyrical silly ness not seen\nsince Terrorvision's Dog Chewed The Handle, belying\nthe emotional message beneath.\nThis latest EP is all that, yet a little more dare I say -mature? It takes a new direction like the proverbial fresh\nnew pair of pants; strange at\nfirst, then just becomes a part\nof you. Kaytronica is the first\ntrack and the most traditionally Yatsura with some familiar\nhigh pitch twanging. Still\nExploding eases us into new\nunexplored territory and sounds suspiciously like their\nfellow Scots, Idlewild. Next up,\nthe acoustic, Nobody knows\nwe're Stars is sensitive and mellow, if a little frustrated. We finish on Mother of the M BK,a very unusual song which can only be described as being\nlike a superposition (please\ndon't hit me, please) of the\nother three songs.\nHardy\nfrequency . A9 Talking All That Jazz\nLondon Jazz Festival -12 to 21 November\nYou have to admit that jazz is best enjoyed when listened to in a small, noisy, smoky club, overcrowded by sexy and classy couples. However,\nsome artists' international success means they can only perform in big concert halls on their world tours; and that means no atmosphere, lack of style etc... doesn't it? Well, maybe not: there was a Cuban Bonanza at the Barbican Hall on Friday 15th with the bands responsible for the sound track of the highly successful film 'Buena Vista\nSocial Club'. They may have been around50 years old on average, but the music\nwas fabulous. The rhythms were irresistible and most of the crowd progressively started dancing in the aisles! Furthermore, at the end of\nthe fiesta1, the band invited some of the crowd to dance on stage. The Cuban fire had sent the Barbican hall on a one way trip to Santiago! This proves that jazz concerts don't have to be repentance, and more importantly, they're the only way to listen to the best musicians alive!\nAnd that's not exaggerating. That's why you should try and get tickets to some of the acts on offer\nat the London Jazz Festival in November. The Za win ul Syndicate,\nBrand ford Marsalis, Dianne Reeves and Taj Mahal are some of the\njazz legends coming to London, and they will assist British front scene artists like Courtney Pine and Andy Sheppard in offering simply the\nbest jazz concerts you can get.\nThe two acts that will steal the show, are: Dianne Reeves and Joe Za win ul. Dianne Reeves is another one of these artists who can set any\nconcert hall on fire; and so she did a year ago at the Royal Festival\nHall, packed with young black women who couldn't stop expressing\ntheir love for the music. Her voice is irresistible, her scat improvisations would make a paralyzed90 year-old stand up and dance, and her songs about fighting for survival and being strong make her show unmissable both for the music and for the ideas conveyed. Joe Za win ul, keyboardist founder of the groundbreaking group 'Weather\nReport', mixes funk, rock, samples and jazz to revive Mile Davis' electric period. His music is very upbeat, and I promise you, you won't sleep through that one! These concerts aren't exactly cheap, and you have to book in advance to get the best seats for the lowest prices; but no jazz-fan should miss\nthem. Nice. Etienne\nHere' s a list of the choicest cuts from the\nLondon Jazz Festival. Hopefully I 'll be\nmaking it to more than just a few of\nthese so maybe I 'll see you there?\nGreat!14 th November\nCourtney Pine @ Hammersmith Apollo\nThe torch bearer of British Jazz in recent\nyears.

    "content": "1 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Music\nfrequency N/\\ The Charlatans\nUs and Us Only\n(Universal)\nUs and Us Only is the follow up to the excellent Telliri Stories\nalbum. The Charlatans are surprisingly the only real survivors of\nthe Manchester scene (which\nincluded the Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays), some thing that is reflected in the confidence of the album's title.\nWhile a number of the songs,\nlike A House Is Not A Home\nquite strongly recall their earlier\nmaterial (in this case the country\nrock of North Country Boy), this\nis not necessarily such a bad thing. Indeed, there are also\nmore bold, experimental tracks\nnot least the mightily impressive\nsingle, Forever. Building slowly\nfrom a bass-led intro into a great\nuniversal love song, it is one of\nthe best songs they have record-ed. It brings to mind the Stones\nand Primal Scream, yet still\nmaintains their fairly unique\nsound of guitars blending seamless ly with Hammond grooves.\nOne grumble is perhaps that the\nmajority of the songs are a little\ntoo down tempo. There also\naren't really any obvious singles\nin the vein of say One To Another. Yet, while many of their more\nillustrious peers have either\nfaded or are stumbling (e.g. the\nRoses and Oasis), the Char la tans continue to consistently produce good albums.\nMax\nDeath in Vegas\nInterview-A Chat With Tim\nDeath in Vegas's recent album, The Conti no Sessions, was a delicious\nmixed bag of surprises. Their association with the Heavenly label and club\nnights would probably lead one to expect a nice poppy album full of\ndance y tracks and a real feel good factor. On listening though, The Conti no Sessions is far from a pop record, Tim from the band explained when\nFelix writer Boycey had a quick chat with him last week...\nBoycey: So what's all this Heveanly Social, big beat stuff about? It seems\nto me that you boys have more than just a few musical sounds influencing\nyour beats. Please explain.\nTim: The Heavenly Social was never about big beat music. The music pol icy was to play good music of any genre as long as it was good. There\nwas house, rap, soul, indie, absolutely anything. Those club nights were\nbrilliant. Some of the DJs at the Big Beat Boutique club in Brighton had a similar policy so I suppose that was where the association started. Big beat\nmusic is music by numbers though. Pretty much in one ear and out the\nother. Anyone could make an okay big beat track with a few hours on a good computer. With Death in Vegas, myself and Richard try to do quite\na bit more. We trying to make music that pushes back barriers. I'm thirty\neight and Richard is late twenties so we've been around for a while\nBoycey: Thirty-eight? That's quite old for a pop star.\nTim: I 've done a lot of different things in my time, and my experiences have\nchanged me a lot. I used to want to be a fish farmer, and then some work\nexperience showed me that fish farmers were all Barbour wearing upper\nclass to sse rs.I 've also lived a few years of hedonism and bedlam. I used\nto make regular trips to Amsterdam, and although I 've calmed down a lot,\nI still think the place is great. I love little picturesque European cities.\nBoycey: So will one ot these cities be your choice for your mad millenium\nparty, or will you be DJing around the world?\nTim: There's this little island just off the west coast of Scotland called Beaut,\nand I think I 'll be there with a few close friends. I can't be arse d with ma king a big deal of it so I'm opting out. I suppose it's my age again. I'm not\nboring really! It's also just after the tour we're doing so it will be good to\nbe able to relax\nBoycey : And finally before we run out of space, it's Felix cheesy question\ntime We all know that there ain'tno party like an S Club Party, so who would it be Rachel, Hannah, Jo or the other one?\nTim: Sorry mate, I haven't got a clue what you're on about.\nBoycey spoke to Tim from Death in Vegas courtesy of Carling\nDeath in Vegas's second album The Contino Sessions is out now Massive Competition!\n10 tickets, 10 t shirts,\nbeer + a whole lot more\nQuite how this has happened noone is\nsure, but somehow this week we' ve managed our biggest b lag ever at Felix\nMusic. I suppose some might call it luck,\nsome might call it fate and some may even suggest thai it's a lie. But it's not\nand it's great.\nThe winner get's10 free tickets to see\nDeath in Vegas on the 7th November at\nShepherd's Bush Empire, ten free T shirts\nand a big crate of larger.\nPhew! That's enough stuff for even the\nsaddest fool to make some friends - or perfect if you're the most popular boy or girl on the block. Runners up prizes\nrange from more beer to t shirts to bags, and there's tonnes so everyone should enter.\nWhat' s more is that the question is easy\n(the answer is in the article to the left and is picked out in bold), so you've no excuse whatsoever for missing out.\nTo enter simply answer the question\nbelow and get your answers to\nfelix@ ic.a c.ukor pop into the office with\nyour answer on a free postcard from the\nUnion and pop it in the box with your\nname on it. More than nice!\nWhat is the name of\nDeath in Vegas's new album?\n... and don't forget to enter!

Time's running out\nVideo complete with soundtrack and CD available Bela Lugosi's suave performance in the 1 931 film of\nDracula is widely considered to be the classic interpretation of Bram Stoker's bloodsucker Count. Technical limitations of the time meant that this early\n'talk ie' lacked a score. Now, two of the leading figures in contemporary music, the Kronos Quartet and composer Philip Glass, have joined forces to\nrectify this anomaly. Reviews of the CD of this new soundtrack have been somewhat lukewarm; the music suffers from Glass' tendency to re-use and recycle themes from earlier\nworks - in this case, his previous string quartets.\nThis isn't entirely a bad thing, as his string quartets\nare exceedingly fine pieces of music: new listeners\ncertainly won't suffer. For those with previous experience of Glass' music, however, the soundtrack alone may be a disappointment. The live performance is a different matter. The Kr o nos Quartet joined by the composer on keyboards perform behind a semi-translucent screen, onto\nwhich the film is projected. As the lighting that falls\non them changes, so they fade in and out of visibility, like ghosts in the background of the film. Ifs a stunningly atmospheric effect that never intrudes\nupon the film, only adds to it.\nIfs in this context that the music comes into its own. Superbly performed, it goes along way to restoring\nsome of the atmosphere of darkness the film must\nhave had for1931 audiences. If some aspects of\nthe film are more amusing than 'horrific' for amo dern audience, Glass' score provides a deliciously\nspooky background that lets us laugh with, and not\nat, this most celebrated of horror flicks.

Nearest Tube Charring Cross\nFioat like a butterfly, sting like a bee....25 serene photographs\nshow Ali in training before humiliating the fearsome George Foreman\nThink of Mohammad Ali, think of the greatest boxing legend that\never reigned in the seventies. A man full of 'cocksure arrogance' but 'heartening humility', he often predicted which rounds he\nwas going to win his fights. His fights were not only entertaining\nbut also resourceful to the young boxing generation of that time.\nThen, every kid in the block wanted to box like Ali. They bought\nevery souvenir of him and a lot of them even signed up for amateur boxing, but unfortunately never made it pro.\nEvery one of his fights was often preceded by a great deal of\nshowmanship and Ali was always at the centre of it all. This influence alone made his fights more captivating as millions world wide turn on their screens to see Ali live up to his promise. He rarely disappointed, often winning in a unique fashion. This\ncould never have been truer than in Zaire in October1974 when Ali fought and beat George Foreman with a technical\nknockout in round eight. After watching a replay of that fight on the ' big' screens of Proud Galleries, to say that I was flabbergasted would be an understatement. When he claimed to 'float\nlike a butterfly, sting like a bee' few could argue.\nThat was the legendary Rumble in the Jungle. I have never seen\na pro box with so much skill, speed and power, but more importantly, with intelligence against a more daunting opponent. A fact\nthat would make Mike Tyson quite jealous.\nMany who know him well commended his 'heartening humility',\nhis ' amazing sense of humour' and his 'artistic ability'. A great\ninspiration to many, of whom was photographer David King.\n'Let's get this straight (folks),' said King in a recent interview, ' I was not interested in boxing. I was interested in Ali.

Under the inspired leadership of stand in\nCaptain Casanova, The Disco Boys strolled out on to the field of dreams and gave the UCL Rabble a good whipping. The mighty sun medallion was shinning from the off and a goal always looked inevitable. After some serious nocturnal activity at the weekend the Sundance Kid was surprisingly active and weaved some magic around the defence. While UCL stood mes meri sed by Sundance' s Riverd ance style footwork, Haemorrhoids slipped a crafty one past\nthe keeper.\nWhere one had led more would surely follow. Having polished our short corner in an intensive training session, Filtrum\nmanaged to scramble one in. With Filtrum giving a good servicing to anyone, who wanted it, Jesus slotted in a beauty from the top of the D. After inviting\nhimself along Twat demonstrated all his skill by scoring from2 inches. The second half was admittedly crap with neither team scoring, but we're29 goals up from3 BUS A games. Nice! ICII\nSt Bart's74..0 Despite playing what was possibly\nour worst game in three years, we nonetheless destroyed another set\nof medics. With a side that consisted of only six of last week's starting\nline up we started with a fresh, if\ninexperienced line up. As the seconds start, it soon became clear\nthat even the new seconds side\ncould kick some arse even when they were playing well below par.\nThe first try came soon after the\nwhistle with a period of play that\nthe all-blacks would have been proud of, being converted by Jim So pper under the posts. More tries came eventually with the seco nds being about350 up at half\ntime.\nAfter a royal roasting the seco nds did not improve but still managing to put many tries down under the posts. In the end, the score did not really show the dominance of seconds with a score line1500 being much more representative.\nAt the end, man of match Nick Parker ended with 3 tries and a total of29 points. Tries also came from Gl Tim Deny er with 3, fresher s captain Tim Collins with 2 and a try\neach from Jim Sopper, Jeff Mace, Ugo, and Jan Stephenson. However, we know when the\nhard teams start playing us in BUS A we will need to improve by 4 0 0 %\nCome on the seconds. IN BRIEF\nICSM Hockey Netball\nICS MI. RUMS I This fatiguing match ended both\none goal a piece, and one dislocated shoulder a piece at Pad. Rec.\nThe skill shown by both sides was of\na surprising early season quality,\nbut the finishing was at times woe ful, culminating in a missed penalty\nflick by RUMS in the 65th minute.\nICS M scored first through a classic poacher's strike from J ez Boyle, after a short corner break-down, and then wasted a series of good opportunities to kill off the\ngame. After the restart the RUMS' centre midfield began to take an ominous stranglehold on the mid-field, until fortuitously for ICS M he\ndislocated his shoulder, fouling in\ncentre field. Not to be outdone, Nick Keysell went and popped his\nshoulder out attempting a powerful\nclearance, and in the ensuing confusion Nick's opposite number scored with ICS M still in tactical\ndisarray. A tense 1 5 minutes remained as both sides attempted\nto spurn as many chances as possible, and when the final whistle\nblew both teams left to lick their\nwounds and rebuke themselves for\ntheir own wastefulness in front of\ngoal. IC I17 St George's17 This was( yet again) a seriously\nclose match. Tight marking from St. George's defence( and some dubious eye\nshading under the pretence of marking) meant that the IC goal flow was reduced to a few outstanding shots from Rebekah and Sara in\nthe first half. Paula \"the roadrunner\" did her thing, feeding the ball in\nand around the circle to set up the\nshooters, and a fired up Kirstie kept\nthe St George's WA well under control. At half time, the score was 9-9.\nA few substitutions later and with Becky, the umpire, muttering\n\" how does this pen work?\" the seco nd half got underway to a furious\npace. Jess and Jane zoomed around the court, and the defensive\ncombination of Alex (occasionally\nlooking rather surprised when the\nball bounced in front of her) and Kathryn in the IC circle, kept us in\ncontention. Things were looking up with 13mins to go when the St.\nGeorge's centre twisted her ankle\nand the ice packs were broken\nopen. As St George's had no substitutes, we took the opportunity to try and bury her under a pile of coats under the pretext of keeping\nher warm, thus reducing their team to 6 players. Unfortunately her team-mates did not forget about her, and her injury was not serious\nso she was able to play on. In the\ndying moments of the game, two\nquick-fire goals saw IC draw level\nand claim a well-deserved draw.\nWell played everyone! Next time\nwe WIN! Men's Football (5th s) Kings V3 IC V4 After a poor performance in the\nleague on Saturday, losing 2-0 to LSE VI, we needed a boost in this\ngame against a team from the division above to kick start our league campaign. Once the opposition had managed to find\ntheir own ground, and sorted out which one of them was captain, the game got underway, with Kings\nlooking like a bunch of thugs who might knowhow to play football. We started badly, conceding a goal early on, when their striker\n(the cockiest bastard ever known) collected the ball and sent a low shot into the corner. Kings looked like a team who expected to win100 with ease. But IC V never lie\ndown( except in the bar at the end of the night) and we came stor ming back with a great finish from Si \" Mahatma\" Gandy. We were now playing some great football, with even Will\" GOD\"( or is that\n\" DOG\") Dow bor getting into the game. The second goal came after their keeper fumbled a save, really pissing the cocky gits off.\nBut our football was sadly Kee genes q and they managed to fluke a goal back to make it 2-2\nat half time. After the break, the second half started. This was handy, as it\nallowed our resident dinosaur to complete his hat trick with an eat back header into the top corner,\nand another fine finish after a great moved own the left. Kings late consolation made it 4 - 3 at\nthe end, but they knew they were well beaten, even asking the ref to call a halt early... Come on Kings,\ntake it, take it!\n\n"

    "content": "1 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Films 27\nscreen\nCINEMA\nWhat's on at ICU Cinema Vampires\nODEO\nPushing Tin Competition\nAt last, I have witnessed the new look ICU cinema for myself. Gone are the days when you could only hear the film if you borrowed your granny' shearing aid. Thanks to the marvellous new Dolby Dig i tal sound, you don't have to lipread anymore. You don't even have to squint anymore when the focus goes as they've final ly sorted that out. So, hey presto, we now have a massive screen that gets used to it's full potential and is a credit to our Union. This week ICU cinema is showing the clever and funny Go! along side the alla c tion Thomas Crown Affair. Both films\nare being shown on Monday and Tuesday evening. Go! is a story told from three perspectives. It's about a bunch of young Californians trying to get some cash, do and deal some drugs, and acquire sex in Las Vegas. They\nall just want to experience the rush of life.\nGo! is sort of a teen flick but don't be put off as it is definitely worth watching. The Thomas Crown Affair stars Pierce\nBrosnan and Rene Russo in are make of this film about a bored millionaire who likes to steal art. It turns into a comedy when the leading characters fall in love\nand Russo's character finds herself making a tough decision. In case you haven't found the cinema yet it\nis located in the concert hall in the union building and is probably the only cinema that you can take your beer in to s upon while watching a good film. Also, don't forget to look at the posters on the walkway for the times and details of the showings. A horror movie by John Carpenter, director of such\ncult flicks as The Thing, Village of the Damned and Halloween, should bean event not to miss. The sad\ntruth is that his latest film, Vampires, wil i probably\npass by without much acclaim. The story follows Jack Crow( James Woods) as leader\nof Team Crow', a group of Mercenary Vampire slayers funded by the Catholic Church. By 'cleaning out a nest1 somewhere in Mexico enter over use of amigo and padre - they incur the wrath of a powerful master vampire named Valek who decimates the entire\nteam except Crow and Montoya( Daniel Baldwin,\nanother of the Baldwin brothers). It is left to them to\nprevent Valek from finding the Berziers Cross. This\ncross would allow him and all vampires to walk by\nday, making them impossible to kill.\nThis story is a good idea; it has so much promise but\nis somehow left a little thin. The mm is slow-paced\nand deliberated. It is somewhere between a spaghetti western (over long shots of tough men in a desert\nbackground) and a hammer horror (latex body parts\nand plenty of blood). Still the production qualities are\nhigh, especially considering the modest budget of\n$20 million. For a horror it is rarely scary, leaving you\nfirmly rooted at the back of your seat. This is pro b ably because you feel little empathy with any of the\ncharacters, particularly Woods, who seems deter-mined to do things the hard way.\nIt would be unfair to say that once the film had started I wasn't interested in the end, and the cinematography is certainly good; but somewhere along the\nline, it just fails to capture the imagination. Perhaps\nthis is because it treads an uneasy line between trying\nto be ground breaking while still keeping to the vampire ethos. The vampires may be immune to garlic but\nthey still wear gothic evening wear. For a Friday night out this film is hardly recommend able, but for a change from the usual Hollywood blockbuster it may be worth a look.\nKatherine and Dave This week the Odeon Kensington have\nbenevolently donated five pairs of tickets to\nsee 'Pushing Tin1 starring John Cusack( Grosse Point Blank) and Billy Bob Thornton( Armageddon). Pushing Tin is a comedy and drama about life, love, aeroplanes and other bumpy rides.\nSet in the high-tension atmosphere of the\nchaotic air traffic control centre for New York's three major airports this film is about territorial feelings between men and how they deal with them. As always all you have to do is answer a sim ply question, This week the question is\nWho connects Pushing Tin and\nFour Weddings And A Funeral?\nAnswers on a virtual postcard to\nfilm.felix@ic.ac.uk\nbefore Wednesday3 November. The winner of last weeks Blair Witch competition has won the fantastically amazing Blair\nWitch goody bag, and that person is\nJennifer Edwards\nAnd the runners up who all got the question\nright, get a pair of tickets to see this most terrifying film.

Felix this year seems to have start-ed well and will, Iam confident, go from strength to strength over the year. It does seem, however,\nthat this year's columns are gene rating a few problems. Of course, that's there role, but there are problems and there are problems. Firstly, I must fully agree with\nJohn Quant r ell's point about anonymity, leading, I suspect, to\nsome confusion, in your editorial. As a columnist for the previous four years, I would never disagree with the protection of sources. Had I not protected mine, the\nVoice of Reason would never have\nlasted as it did. Despite witch hunts of which Joe McCarthy would have been proud, they still\ndon't know who he/she/it/they\nis/are, so it's not a problem if\nyou' re careful. However, that is a totally different issue to the anonymity of authors. You are, I fear, quite wrong to suggest that 'it\nwould irrevocably damage the ability of the writers to collect information if their identity was known.' On the contrary, my experiences suggest that it is imp ossi ble to do a good job in the column game without one's identity\nbeing widely known. Over the four years I was in the chair, I must\nhave been approached by hundreds of people, offering information, suggestions for articles etc.\nWithout a name and that delight ful photo, I would have been stuffed. There are only two s cena rios in which author anonymity would be justified: if the author's life or place at College were in\njeopardy, in which case write it\nelsewhere in Felix, or if the column were so exe crab ly awful that the\nauthor did not have the guts to put\nhis or her name to it. The former certainly hasn't applied at IC, and it is probably better if I reserve\njudgement on the latter point, beyond saying that I always, with out exception, used my column to\nsavage the credibility of any anonymous article or letter in\nFelix.\nSecondly, I feel it necessary, at\nthe risk of sounding patronising( moi?), to offer a little advice to\nthe columnists, Break point in particular. You should have learnt by\nnow that you do NOT, under any circumstances, attack ICU on specific, issues unless your facts are so ir re futa bly watertight that Perry\nMason, Rum pole and Kavanagh together would give up and go home rather than challenge you. Any less than this position makes for a very tedious letters page. Abroad brush, but factual, approach will be much more successful, concentrating on the grossly inefficient bureaucracy that\nchokes ICU driven by the mis gui ded aim of ' being inclusive', which means allowing everyone to sit on one of a thousand pointless committees that only survive becuase of the unpaid status of most of\ntheir members. Less charitable souls than myself have suggested that our new President is not exactly a Sir John Harvey Jones on the organisational management front, so the last thing she needs is to have write letters to Felix every week. I would point out that there's a small department on campus that\nseems to generate plenty of mate rial for columnists and problems for the rest of IC. You may have heard of it, Break point? It's near the Queen's Tower and it's called the Sherfield Building. Its machi nations always use to the bane of\nall of our lives, and I doubt they' ve changed much. They must\nbe thinking it's Christmas come early, so why not, in the modified words of Harry Truman, come inside the tent and start pissing\nout, rather than the other way round, as you have done relentlessly to date. All the best,\nSimon Baker ANONYMITY: THE DEBATE CONTINUES Dear Felix (and Kevin),\nOk, so what exactly is the problem people have with Kevin. I 've\nread his column since it started last\nterm, and yes, I have to admit, it pro-v oke demotion. Good on him say I, as to provoke any sort of response in\nthis apathetic university must mean he is doing something right!!!\nPeople complain that he slags\noff their course, but from what I remember( considering I'man idiot,\nwithout any back issues of Felix) he\nhas commented about many different disciplines. Also, if people are\nreally stressed with what he has writ-ten, why don't they write directly to\nhim? Or are they being too stupid\nthat they don't actually read his Email address at the bottom of the\npage. Now call me foolish, but is\nthis there so that people can contact\nhim?\nAs to finding out whom Kevin is,\nI think will be rather difficult, as pinning him down to one place must be\nhard! I say this, because last term he\nattended some physics lectures (as I remember), and this term he is sitting\nin medical lectures - hmmm. This\ncould therefore lead to the con clu sion that Kevin is actually the Rector.\nBut would I really like to join the rest\nof the gang and jump to conclusions, rather than take the column at\nface value, the way I think that its\nintended!\nTEFF H(A second year entity)\nDear Dave, We medics tend to get a bad press and I think that we are not\ngiven enough credit. Were it not for\nus, Felix would have a lot of empty\nspace and a dwindling numbers of\nreaders. After all, we tend to feature\nprominently in every issue and it is a lot easier to grab people's interest by\nlaying into the medics (as we tend to\narouse a lot of passion) than it is to\nundertake decent, investigative jour-The deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 noon - drop into the porta-cabins or email felix@ic.ac.uk.

' |!f!I Hi ' :';\n'\nR/C Stunt Copter (PSX)\nAn airborne radio-controlled vehicle is often the\ndream present for many kids. Unfortunately\nhowever it's usually only the pretentious little rich\ngits that ever get hold of one. R/C Stunt Copter from Interplay allows everyone to sample the flavour of flying ar/c helicopter, without the fear\nof having to fork out hundreds if you crash the\ndamn thing... Stunt Copter was designed to work with the\nPlaystation Dual Shock controller, enabling the player to use one analogue stick for directional\nrotation and the other for thrust. If you don't have\nthis controller the left and right control pads on the original joy pad will suffice. Initially movement\nis extremely tricky and you'll find yourself constantly having to juggle your concentration between altitude, thrust and angle as you edge onward and upward. This can be very frustrating,\nespecially considering the fact that it's plain obvious what you have to do, it's just difficult to execute the action. For once then the training levels\nare absolutely necessary and anyone who goes\ndiving in at the deep end will get a sordid confidence bashing. Supposedly you should be able\nto enjoy the game more after training, having\ngained competency in integrating all aspects of\nflying without too much thought. A fine theory,\nbut you need to be patient enough to reach that\nstage, and I for one certainly wasn't. Whether it\nbe slalom courses or balloon shooting, the missions themselves are highly disappointing and rarely last longer than a couple of minutes. Even\nthe 2-player mode is fairly poor, with each player\ntaking their turn to complete the level objectives,\nrather than flying simultaneously. The most fun to\nbe had actually comes when you're watching your\nopponent, as you can drive them mad by sticking\na whopping great hand in front of their view (wit-ness screenshot).\nThe yankee commentator will also provide some light relief - that is until he gets annoying. Generally speaking the sound and graphics are quite\ngood for this sort of game and the control is well\ndesigned, but these factors do not makeup for the repetitious, difficult and boring gameplay.\nStunt Copter isn't bad, it just doesn't present\nenough to keep all but a small group of fanatics\ninterested for long.\nViv\nLMA manager (PSX)\nConsoles are not renowned for complex, management type games, but Codemasters' LAM manager is a serious non-con former when it\ncomes to such stereotyping. At last there is a football management game for a console which can match the very best available for the PC and that's without a keyboard and mouse.\nAs with most footy sims, the player can be assured\nof up-to-date stats (the current 1 9 9 9 - 2 0 0 0 season complete with its real-life fixture list is your\nstarting point) and total control of their club - if\nthey want it. For the less patient gamer tasks such\nas player training and sponsorship deals can be assigned to assistant managers without detracting\ntoo much fun from the game. Watching your\nteam in action is highly entertaining and recreates\nsome of the tension you get from watching your\nfavourite club on TV Of course, if the game's not\ngoing so well you can alter team tactics or bring\nin fresh blood at any time during the match. Aftermath match analysis and3 D highlights are similarly excellent with commentary from Ray Stubbs\nand the woefully good Alan Hansen. Upgrading your stadium is a fantastic way to\nwaste money, especially on a club like Brighton\nwhere the attendance rarely rises above the 5 , 0 0 0\nmark. Coaxing quality players to your club is a feat to behold in the lower divisions, but this is\nwhere you should start as its far more satisfying\ntaking a lowly Division 3 side all the way to the\ntop, rather than starting out with a ready-made\npremiership member. The youth squad provides\nan excellent pool of potential young stars, and if\nyou are particularly scheming then you'll promote\nthem all to the first team and flog ' em off the next\nseason. If the 5 0 year career mode does not\nappeal then there are a number of challenges to\nbe tried out, and you'll be able to compare your\nfinal score with others over the Internet. Take on a flat mate in 2-player mode and prepare for some serious competition in the league. (Just for\nthe record I landed 13th position for Brighton in\nthe 1st season while my room-mate attained relegation for Torquay... hah aha!)L AM manager has been so magnificently engineered around the Playstation that the myriad of\noptions available can be accessed and changed with minimum fuss, using a simple L/R button\nmenu system. All managerial screens are clearly\npresented with easy to read text, and excellent\nmini-animations too. Deservedly so,L MAma nager nestled in at the top of Playstation sales\ncharts everywhere.

    "content": "34 Clubs & Societies Felix \u2022 1 November 1999\nBart s outplayed by skillful IC Football - amazingly long report for minor match\nImperial VI 2\nSB LH III 0\nFor this, our second league game of the season, the omens were bad: the kit briefly forgotten, walking through Hyde Park in the pouring rain,a severe player shortage, there were even problems locating our coach! In the end it was a past icc io of new com ers, players looted from the sevenths (cheers, Jamil) and sixth\nteam veterans who took the field\nagainst Barts. Even captain Mike Niko lich was unfit to play, instead taking the role of referee, thus\nrestoring ex captain Rob Dave n port to skipper for the day.\nHis first decision to kick into\nthe wind during the opening45 minutes - raised a few eyebrows but by the break he was fully vindicated, with Imperial coming in a goal to the good. This arrived after one of many IC breakaway s during the first half, with Booth finally slotting the ball home from a narrow angle. Meanwhile, the medics contested that the ball had already run out of play. In fact,\nwith a couple of goals on the opening day and a hat-trick in a midweek friendly, James is already filling the void left by the de par ture of UL U League Golden Boot winner Tom Wilson to the fifths.\nThe medics themselves made little use of the windy conditions during the opening period, every\nunimaginative through ball being either dealt with with consummate ease by new centre back pairing Den B raber and Head, or else\nskidding off the wet turf into the grateful arms of keeper Andy Pease, who didn't miss a thing all day.\nWith the second period hardly\nstarted, any thoughts of a nSB LH onslaught were laid firmly to rest\nas midfield playmaker Dan Wilson followed up a string of attempts in\nthe Barts area to fire home the loose ball: two-nil. Despite plenty\nof time to draw level, the medics were never in the game past this\npoint, with Rob stamping out everything in midfield. Towards the end one of the frustrated SB LH players resorted to some stamping of his own, though of a different kind, and was duly\nwarned of his conduct by the ref-eree, who had a competent game all round. Even when Barts\nscrapped their five man midfield and reverted to 4-4-2 it was no use, with their attack proving just\nas impotent as before. Imperial\nlooked dangerous on the counter throughout the half, with Luis\nQua rant a on the left-wing running the opposition a merry dance, whilst Dan My at t and James did likewise upfront. DougH in es up plied a string of quality crosses\nfrom the right and it is true to say\nthat the victory would have been far more comprehensive had it\nnot been for the heroics of the opposition no.1. So, a great team performance buried the ghost of a few months ago. After a second half down pour, a rainbow greeted the final\nwhistle, hopefully heralding a new dawn for the sixth team after the\ndour performances so far. At the very least, we take from the game our first three points of the league season and a large bout of contentment. Football 4th sG KT IV 0\nIC IV 2\nAnother match day, another random team with odds and ends\nhere and there - we should really\nhave thrashed this team since\nthey are a division below us, but yet another game of missed chances and dubious midfield play resulted in only two goals. The first came in the first half with\nJavier having a speculative shot\nat the awful G KT goalkeeper who let it creep past him into the net.\nThe second came from a good move early in the first half with\nBola playing it out wide to Nim a who whipped a low cross into the\nbox that was nicely slotted in by\nKnut for his second goal of the season. We desperately missed Cap tain Aidan Banks up front with his\nkiller instinct and great finishing,\nchance after chance went begging but nothing was coming although the forwards, Max and J avi, ran their hearts out and La urie in the second half had a few good touches. Peyrouz hit the post with a great shot and had a few good trys at go a! at other\ntimes but had to come off at halftime due to a dod gy ankle. Shotguns at dawn\nRifle Shooting\nAt 9 . 0 0 am the dregs of society\ngathered at the Sports centre, yes the RPC was going on a shotgun trip. By 1 0 the dregs moved to the\nminibus and a fairly uneventful journey to JJ's Shotgun a rama Emporium ensued. On arrival and after several cups of tea and suitable appreciation of the King Charles puppies we got on with the task of shooting. Each of the four groups performed well with little drama shooting varied between excellent and enthusiastic. Guy performed well, winning the men's trophy with a solid34, whilst Rachel took home the ladies trophy. And the wooden spoon was jointly shared between Jake and Adeline whose shooting could only be described as a great steaming pile of enthusiasm. Once the shooting thing had been done we got on with the rest\nof the day, and the club divided between the drunks and the shoppers.\" Several hours/ bargains/ pints later we began to wend our merry way home. The strains of\" Stay in' Alive\" and Rolf Harris\nand the accompanying dance choreography entertained the traffic all the way.\nWe congratulate Dave Turner\nfor snapping his gun, Mark Carter for once again getting his face in\nthe way, and Ben, our driver, for his many kind toilet stops.\nIf you' di ike to come along and try shotguns, shopping, rifles,\narchery or air guns comedown to the Sports Centre in Princes Gardens and locate the Projectile\nJoin up for ICU's newest club - Military Coup Soc\nHall, where you'll find a friendly\nband of responsible people who will show you how to join up.

    "content": "1 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Books 25\nbooks Cool Classics and\nBooks You Should\nHave Read\nTimeless! Groundbreaking! Inspirational! A work\nof profound cultural importance! A damned good read! Cool Classics and Books YS HR, the\nFelix feature where you get to learn about old books that make you seem more culturally aware\nthan you really are, and maybe even read one. Arthurian legend has recently fallen into disrepute. As perhaps one of the more easily accessed stories of\nEnglish/Celtic myth it has in turns been romantic is ed, de mythic i se d, oversimplified and used as fodder for Saturday\nafternoon television. And on a less innocent note I can say that the name Lancelot has become synonymous with television programmes involving a cringe worthy plot and ladies of a dubious nature.\nYet I have placed myself in the uncertain position of trying to persuade other people to read The Once and Future\nKing which is undeniably a classic novel dealing with the Arthurian cycle, 'King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table' for those less enthusiastic than me. It is essentially a quartet of books of which the first, The Sword in the Stone is probably the best known perhaps through the animated version released several years ago if not in the written form. The Sword in the Stone is a beautiful tale. The characters are defined and described in almost completely humourous terms and that humour is wonderfully English. Of the whole quartet this section is the lightest in tone and cheerfullest in subject matter; the tale of\na small boy, affectionately known as the Wart, growing up in a fantastic environment unaware that he is one day to\nbe the King. It may sound simple, it may even sound pretentious, but the writing is so detailed and so entertaining\nthat an older reader can find immense satisfaction in it.\nIt is not a realistic tale in any sense of the word; situations are fanciful and imaginative in the extreme, except perhaps for the random lectures' on how heavy armour really was in the old days and how that restricted the pace of a duel. The problems that the Wart encounters as he grows up tend to be of the philosophical and theoretical kind rather\nthan rude and damaging encounters with the harshness of life.\nBut this makes for an innocent, light, wonderfully sentimental, sit-by-the-fire-and-munch-Christmas pu d type read. Which is never a bad thing, no matter what the literary types say.\nThe other three books contained within The Once and Future King deal with the main characters and the events lea ding up to the destruction of the Round Table and the death of Arthur. Consequently these books do not have the bright\ncheerfulness that is inherent in The Sword in the Stone. As adults the characters are allowed to have more complex emotions and to therefore exist in a much more complicated world. All except for Arthur that is, who retains the simple emotions and ideal is at ions of his childhood. This is where the novel as a whole develops its pathos. The central\ncharacter has the innocence of a stereotypical child whilst all the characters surrounding him are involved in some scheme or plot. What I love about these three books is that the author does not deal too harshly with the 'bad' characters; he shows them to be human, that anyone could make the mistakes that these characters make. I recommend this to those who love reading about different people, to those who love myths, to those who want to\nlose themselves for a little while in a world that is nicer than IC, and to those with lots of work to do. Flic\nFelix Recommends\nEach of the books which is reviewed in Felix can be purchased from the Waterstone's book store on campus, next\nto the main library, at a discount of 2 0 % during the week of the review. Waterstone's aim is to promote reading in\ngeneral, by improving the availability or titles recommended and by offering them to Felix readers at a reduced price. Be sure to stop by the store and see if you agree with our reviews.\nFugitive\nPieces, Anne\nMicheals\nWritten as a memoir, starting with youth against the\nbackdrop of the Second WorldWar and the Holocaust, Fugitive Pieces is a novel of singularly beautiful\nprose and powerful imagery.\nThe first novel by Micheals, who prior to Pieces was known for her skills as a poet, FP' de ql s with history,\nmemory, love, cruelty and the capricious n atu re of\ntime.\nA review cannot do justice\nto the task of explaining what makes this book so\nspecial. It is filled with short\nsensual episodes through which the recollections of\nJakob Beer become his\nstory. For example, the murder of his parents while Jakob hides:' Noises never heard before\ntorn from my father's mouth. Then silence. My mother had been sewing a button on my shirt. She kept\nher buttons in a chipped saucer. I heard the rim of the\nsaucer in circles on the floor.\nI heard the spray of buttons,\nlittle white teeth.'\nRead it.\nWaterstone's is open Monday Friday9:00 am to 7 : 0 0 pm and Saturday 1 0 : 0 0 am to 5 : 0 0 pm. \u2022 Russell\n\n"

To get\ntwo awesome days, climbing the\ngrit stone crags of the Peak District.\nAs a relative novice to the world of rock climbing, I wasn't quite sure\nwhat to expect, but just the thought\nof leaving London for the weekend was reason enough togo.

    "content": "HU Big Issue Felix \u00ab 1 November 1999\nThem and NUS\nDAVID ROBERTS\nAs we all (hopefully) know, Imperial\nCollege isn't affiliated to the National Union of Students. Why not? After all, practically every other\ncollege and university union in the\ncountry is a member,[ with the\nexception of most of the Scottish\nHigher Education institutions (of\nwhich more later) and, as of last\nmonth, UMIST], yet since the\n1930's Imperial College Union has been a member for a grand total of\nsix years. [ICU last left in 1 9 7 9 ,\nwhen Trevor Phillips (a former ICU President and potential Deputy Mayor of London) was leading the\nNUS]. Costs\nRe-affiliating to the NUS would cost\nICU between \u00a3 2 0 K and \u00a3 5 0 Ka year, depending on who you talk to, but in all probability the final figure\nwould be around \u00a3 3 0 0 0 0 . How ev er, that's only a fifth of what we pay the University of London Union, or3% of the Union's total College grant, so is it really that much? Well, from a cost effectiveness\npoint of view, membership of the\nNUS primarily means membership of NUSS L(N US Services Ltd), which\nis regarded by most students unions\nas the main reason for staying with\nthe national body. NUSS L is effectively a purchasing consortium which allows unions access to cheap supplies of beer, stationary,\nfood, sports kit and other student\nstaples - in other words it's the re a son that student bars up and down the country manage to keep their\nprices so low. It's also the reason\nthat the Scottish universities decided to leave the national body as they\nweren't allowed to d is affiliate from one without automatically quitting\nthe other, they resigned from the\nNUS as a whole in protest.\nHowever, bar prices at) IC are as low as any other student bar in\nLondon so does IC sub sid is e it's prices or buy it's beer on the black\nmarket? No, it's much simpler instead of rigidly adhering to one consortium ICU uses a mixture of\nNorthern Services (a purchasing group set up by the Scottish students unions, which anyone can join for a tiny fee), TU CO( the College purchasing group) and local\nconsortiums, and consequently gets, by and large, the same( if not\nbetter) prices than every other union\nin the country.\nRepresentation\nOK, so what's the point of having a national representative body for any group of people? To exert\npower at the highest levels, push for the rights of it's members, ensure\nfair and equal treatment and provide a system of support and train-ing, right? In theory, that's exactly\nwhat the NUS is supposed to do. In\nreality, however, it's campaigning record in recent years has been less\nthan enviable. Opposition to fees\nwas so badly organised and ineffective it has provoked damnation from every sector of Higher E duca tion. Opposition to the abolition of\ngrants was equally non-existent,\nand it's only now, with the decisions\nin place and almost entirely unalterable, that marches and demonstrations of any note are beginning to filter through from the leader-ship. Nonetheless, national representation and campaigning is an essential requirement if we are to\nhave any input in the way Higher Education is run in the next millennia - so wouldn't it be better to be\non the inside? The difficulty is that\nthe problem with NUS is endemic rather than issue-specific. Until the\nentire national student movement undergoes a radical shakeup, nothing's going to change... So what is the problem? Lack of\ncommunication? Poor marketing and PR? Or is it simply the case that\nthe NUS leadership puts it's political\ngoals ahead of the national student\ninterest. The fact that when, in the\nlast round of elections, NUS President Andrew Pakes was returned for a second term by a narrow margin, it threatened to be the first time in\nseventeen years that Labour Students (the youth wing of the Labour\nparty) had not controlled NUS is\nprobably a strong sign of the political nature of the organisation. And whilst any kind of political agitation\nis going to seem foreign to proud-to-be-apolitical IC, the shear level\nof behind-the-scenes machinations organised by Mr Pakes shocked the\nentire NUS Conference. In a desperate attempt to cling to power via splinter sections of the Labour block\nvote, Mr Pakes withdrew the Labour Student endorsement from several\nof his colleagues and passed it on to a set of handpicked puppets cho sen from the key institutions and voting groups. He is now, of course, tipped for a very senior job in the\nLabour Party's next election campaign( another interesting statistic\nshows that after the last election\nthere were sixteen different Labour MPs who had previously held the\nposition of NUS President...).\nAlternatives\nBasically, they're aren't any alternatives. Trades Union's in general don't tend to work on a competitive, free market basis - after all, what kind of national representation could be achieved if there were\ntwo national bodies campaigning in opposing directions. The only\nbody that comes close is the Aldwych Group, whose aims, objectives and membership are very different. For starters, the Group was set up to represent the students of\nthe \" better\" universities (although\nrecent League tables might differ\nsubstantially with the identities of\nthe fifteen members) and has as it's primary objective the avoidance of\ntop-up, means-tested and tutorial\nfees for home students. Moreover, although ICU is a member( as\nmembership is free), the Aldwych Group's record on securing con crete accomplishments is no more\nimpressive than that of the NUS itself.\nEffectively, ICU doesn't need to\naffiliate to the NUS in the full\nknowledge that theN US campaigns( however ineffectively) on behalf of it's students anyway. Put\nsimply, nothing will change until an appreciable number of unions leave NUS and considering the\nnumber of stumbling blocks that the\nleaders of the national body tend to\nput in the way of potential leave rs, such an outcome is more than\nunlikely, at least in the short term.\nFor now we'll just continue to sit\nhappily on the outside, awaiting\ndevelopments.

Because more often than not,\nWaterstones do not stock the books I require - there is nothing peculiar about these books; indeed they are\ntop on my department's list of prescribed texts and have been for\nmany years. Moreover, ordering a book from Waterstones only adds to the frustration, and on two occasions previously, it took over a month for them to obtain a single\ncopy of a well-known and popular textbook.\nThe old ICU bookshop' guaranteed* to stock *every* textbook\nprescribed by all academic departments at Imperial, and what do Waterstones offer?

Okay, you' ve done it, so\nnow let's chat about tunes.\nStarting this week's music is\na duo of wonderful divas,\nGabrielle and Macy Gray.\nThen after some Charlatans action, we have a chat to\nTim from Death in Vegas and there's that competition( you have entered haven't you?)\n... frequency...\n... music for you...\nAfter the adverts we're back with a splash of singles, a quick EP and then there's the\nfirst installment of Jazz in frequency - and about time too( blame me for this). Anyway,\nfollowing this column we'll\nhopefully be sorting out some other specialised music columns for your reading pleasure in the not\ntoo distant future. By the\nway, does anyone want to\nwrite about indie metal or maybe even folk music? As well as our big Death in\nVegas b lag, the other great\nevent in this week's f re que n cy is a poem in our clubbing section. Asce pti c doubted its\norigin, but hey I'm a believer\nso never mind any of that\nand read on... Macy Gray\nOn How Life Is\n(Epic)\nThis is the debut album from 29-year-old soul singer Macy Gray, currently\nAmerica's \"hottest sensation\", who's beginning to replicate the attention over\nhere and throughout Europe. Her unusual voice has mostly been compared to Billie Holiday, but that implies it to be rather old-fashioned. In truth, there\nis also the sound of someone like Tina Turner in her '60's heyday. Gray refuses to be pigeonholed but if pushing stupid birds into small openings is your\nthing then her music would best be described as raw soul with large chunks\nof hip-hop, rock, r'h band funk thrown in. In short, an eclectic concoction\nof beats and melodies.\nBorn with a voice that suggested she was the offspring of Tricky and Marge Simpson, she rarely spoke for fear of being teased. It was only after moving\nto Los Angeles to join a film school that she began songwriting with friends.\nWhen singers for her songs didn't appear she was reluctantly roped in..\nMusicians hearing the tape were taken by her unique singing voice: equal\nparts scat, rap and sweet soul. She was snapped up by Epic early last year\nand was given the unique opportunity of going on nationwide tours before\nthe release of any recordings.\nWell, that's a nice fairy tale story following the usual rags-to-riches mould, but is her album much cop? First track Why Didn't You Call Me sets the scene\nnicely - a pleading soul/rock vocal with lush harmonies in the backing vocals\n(provided by Gray herself) over funky hip-hop beats. Whilst the lyrics hint at\ndesperation, there's a general good vibe running through this song. She turns\nas funky as James Brown on the huge Sex-O Matic Venus Freak, spitting out\nher lustful words like a disgruntled Shirley Bassey. Given that she claims all\nher lyrics are based on personal experiences, the track I 've Committed Mur der - about killing her boyfriend's boss as revenge for firing him - is more\nthan a bit worrying. Undoubtedly the album's highlight, however, is her\nbreakthrough single I Try. Its steady climb into the UK Top Ten proves the\nsong's lasting appeal. Its style is rather different to other tracks on On How Life Is, perhaps because it is one of the few songs where Gray wrote the\nmusic as well as the lyrics. Performed in the manner of a70's starlet, I Try\nswells and scrambles its way to a rip-roaring chorus, Gray battling between\nher two vocal tracks as if the good and evil in her mind are both trying to\nmake themselves heard.\nIf the album had a bad point it would be that, while each track combines a variety of styles there is not enough difference between the actual songs. But\nas a debut album, it is more than sufficient and hints at a bright future.\nRyetar\nGabrielle\nRise\n(WEA)\nThis is Gabrielle's third album and definitely her best. Whilst the first album contained such 'gems' as Dreams and the seco nd contained nothing memorable at all,\nit could never be said that her voice was\nanything less than excellent. The third\nalbum finally sees her mature into the style\nthat suits her voice best. That style is a voice-driven crossover between soul and pop and works well for most of the tracks\non this record. Along with these three\nalbums Gabrielle seems to have undergone three image changes to suit the\nchange in style of each. She has moved\nfrom the eye patched record company driven hard woman needing gimmicks, through relative 'normality' (= uninspiring)\nto where she is now. That place is the very\nbig haired soul queen look that looks as if\nit's modelled on Diana Ross\nOne of the main problems with this album is that there is nothing to pick out lyrically\nbetween the tracks - the two variations\nseem to be 'we're in love, it's perfect' and 'we were in love but now we're not and it's your fault1. While these may have their\nplace in the song-writing world they can be, and many times have been, much\nmore inspiring than the lyrics found here.\nHowever, Gabrielle's voice manages to\ndrag them from awfulness and propel\nthem towards a height where you can just\nabout let their crossness slide.\nWhile there is nothing really outstanding\non this album the overall quality is good. Unfortunately when compared to other\nrecords such as that from Macy Gray it just\ncan't hold its appeal and is easily eclipsed.\nTim\n\n"

This is not a question that many of us are likely to consider, but last\nMonday, Nobel laureate Sir Joseph Rotblat shared his thoughts, experiences and motivation fore mbar king and subsequently resigning from the atomic bomb project du ring the Second World War.\nBorn in 1 9 0 8 , Sir Joseph spent\nhis first thirty years in Poland before\nmoving to Liverpool to work on neutron scattering under James Chadwick. During his time at Liverp oo land almost simultaneously with other groups, Sir Joseph deduced the chain reaction for nuclear fission and became aware of the enormous quantity of energy\nthat could be released. He spoke with Chadwick over the potential\nuses of such an energy source and agreed that it could become a potentially devastating weapon. Shortly after Sir Joseph's discovery, war broke out in Europe. Atomic scientists in the USA wrote to\nPresident Roosevelt, warning of the\ndangers posed by a German a to mic weapon and urging him to funnel\nresearch into making an allied atomic bomb. Roosevelt gave his\nconsent to the project, codenamed the \" Manhattan Project\", one day before the Pearl Harbour bombing. Under the direction of Robert J Oppenheimer, the project was based at Los Alamos, New Mexico and called almost every top-ranking\nallied scientist to its cause.\nSir Joseph agreed with the project's motivation, that it was vital\nthat the allies develop anatomic weapon before the Nazis, to safe-guard democracy against the worst\nkind of totalitarianism. However,\nwhen intelligence sources revealed\nthat the German project was floundering, the motivation to build the\nbomb changed and Sir Joseph took\nthe unpopular decision to resign.\nHis colleagues preferred to stay\nuntil the first test had been completed, yet most later voted against\ndirecting the bomb upon civilian\ntargets. By that stage the bomb had become a political and military con cern.\nSir Joseph moved into medical physics where he continued his distinguished career and spent much of his time campaigning for practical and socially responsible app li cations of science. He is the only\nsurviving signatory of the RussellEinstein manifesto, a document which led to a meeting of scientists\nin as mali Canadian town, Pugwash, to discuss the role of science\nand world affairs. Since then, the\n\" Pugwash Conferences\" have become an influential body of eminent scientists that continue to voice\nopinions upon the application of\nscience today. It was Sir Joseph's efforts that earned him the Nobel Peace Prize, together with the Pugwash organisation in 1 9 9 5 .\nIn the same spirit, a \"Student\nPugwash\" group has been set up at\nImperial College and Sir Joseph's lecture marked the first in a series of\nlectures, aimed at exploring the\nsocial responsibilities of scientists.\nThe group will be actively involved\nin the forthcoming Pugwash Conf e rence on Science and World Affairs\nheld in Cambridge in August2000, an event that draws influential scientists from around the world. The next lecture will be given by Dr.\nJohn Has s ard from the Physics\nDepartment and previously of the\nRoyal Commission on Nuclear Energy. He will speak on\" Will Climate Change Drive Nuclear Prolife ration?\" at 1 pm on Thursday 4th November in the Union Dining Hall. Weekly meetings are on Thursdays at 1 pm in the Brown commit tee room, and everyone is welcome!. More information on the\nsociety can be found at\nwww. su.ic.a c.uk/ pugwash. Overseas Societies\nComittee elected at last\nDINESH GANESARAJAH\nOn the 5th attempt to hold elections\nfor a new committee for the 1 9 9 9 /\n2 0 0 0 Academic year, the Overseas Students Committee( OS C) seems\nto finally have a set of officers to\nrepresent the overseas societies of\nImperial College Union. Sen Ganesh was victorious in winning\nthe OS C Chair, with Mo gaining Vice Chair and Sachin attaining\nTreasurer. The previous efforts to hold elections had been unsuccessful due to the low turnout of eligible\nvoters (the chairs of the individual\nOS C societies).\nWith 3 0 % of Imperial College made up foreign students, OS C is\nseen as playing an important role in\nImperial College. The highlight of\nthe OS C calendar has always been\nInternational Night, which in recent\nyears has continued to consistently\nmake heavy losses. Traditionally a food fair followed by a show and disco, International Night is the one occasion where overseas societies\nare given the opportunity to reveal\ntheir culture to the rest of Imperial.\nHowever, there have even been\nsuggestions that another disaster\nwill spell the end of this annual event.\nIn this light, the new committee\nwill have a tough task ahead. Now that the new academic year is fully\nunder way, with the new personnel\nonly having been elected recently,\nthe challenge for the new commit tee looks to be even tougher. The challenges will include playing catch up to becoming financially\ntrained and versed in the bureaucracy of ICU, as well as improving\ncommunication between the OS C group and its societies, the lack of\nwhich has been the very reason for\nthe late elections.

Endorsed by Jordan Grand Prix I had visions of mimicking the\nDamon Hill of old... Boasting aFl car style wheel, gear change and built\nin force feedback this piece of hardware certainly comes well equipped. However, all this promise turned to dust when I eventually jumped in the\ndriver's seat and found that steering was rather more difficult than first\nhoped. Adjusting sensitivity made little difference, the car either wouldn't turn at all or instead went into an uncontrollable swerving motion, ending up with an artistic spin. As frustration and rough handling increased, the\nforce feedback vibrations became barely noticeable. Another problem common to most wheel controllers is that an aggressive turn when you're\ntrying to beat a sharp corner usually results in your lifting the wheel in the\nair, - wheels are simply not heavy enough for serious driving. At the end of the day you've got to ask yourself whether its worth having such a bulky\naccess or/ personally I don't believe any of them are worth the desk\nspace. Ben's View: My view of the Joytech\nwheel can be summed up in one word - disappointing. While the\nwheel gives a much better feeling\nof actually driving a car, what it\ndoesn't give you is any sort of control over the game. I found myself\nconstantly weaving from left to right and spinning off the track in\nevery racing game I played. The whole point of a specialised driving wheel is that it makes it easier\nto drive, not harder. If I'd paid money for this thing I'd be back at\nthe shop by now demanding a refund.\nMark's View: It's big, black and looks impressive( not that thing, the other thing). I'm talking about the Joy tech steering wheel. It does look good and one would have thought would be the ideal answer to all those hard to control driving games( Grand Tourism o anyone?). Surely a joy pad shaped like a wheel is going to be the closest\nwe come to the real thing. It is a good idea but sadly the wheel is\njust at ad too sensitive and turns\nhard games into impossible ones.A slight nudge of the wheel does nothing but an extra micron of pressure and you are doing360's all over the shop. It takes a bit of perseverance to master.\nOnce mastered it is good fun but\nI think it still needs some fine-tuning. Once this is done I'm sure it will be a sure-fire hit. It\nwill give a higher play ability and pleasure to all racing games.2 out of5 but with tuning an easy\n4 out of 5.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nPartially banned for its violent nature, C armageddon is a wild racing game. Set in the year 2 0 2 8 , a new sport has been born to control\na catastrophic accident that trans-formed part of the human race into\nzombies( could happen).\nThere are several ways in which you can play this game. Firstly you can treat it as a standard racing game and complete the allotted amount of laps faster than anybody else.\nThis, however, is dull and some thing you can do with any other\ndriving game. Alternatively you can waste anything that moves. This\ninvolves mowing down the zombies in a gratuitous fashion or kicking\nthe **** out of the other cars by\nramming them to bits but preferably\nboth. It's the way that you can perform these actions that make it all\nworthwhile though. For instance,\nram ping off a100 storey building\nwhile performing a triple somersault\nto land on a police car scores high-ly, as does a hand brake turn at 1 0 0\nmph into a group of zombies. That\nearns you a\" combo bonus\". Squash the dead men walking into awa ii for a \"piledriver bonus\" and you might even earn applause for \"artis-tic impression\". There are also lots\nof wacky power-ups that can aid you in the quest of caning your\nopponents, such as the hot rod and opponent freeze, but there are others that can somewhat hinder your\nprogress, such as jelly suspension\nand lunar gravity. You must not forget that during your zealous car-n age your own car will be getting\npummelled so you must collect\ncredits so you can repair your car in\norder for you to continue the rampage. I loved this game because it was original and the gameplay is highly\naddictive. There isn'tanya r sing around with careful driving; you're\nnot trying to win the grand prix or anything. It is pure pleasure, just\nlike being in a crockery shop and being able togo completely ape and being rewarded for your trouble in doing so. Fantastic.\nMark "

To the reader, you now have the chance to discover a glimpse of some of the things we do. To the C CU, the strange by-product is that if the C CU is not doing anything, they are now forced to do something if they are to include anything in their page, as monthly streams of \"hello - its us\nagain!\" do not bode well for the\nstate of the C CU. Fortunately for this C CU, City & Guilds College Union, we are now doing so much that a fortnightly section in Felix\nwould not stretch the writing capacity of the activities we are currently involved in. Unfortunate ly, we have not been granted this\nprivilege.\nIf you have been following this\nsection of Felix avidly, you will\nhave opened this issue expecting the return of the Medics to\" do their stuff\". Unfortunately, despite\nhaving exciting things to come from the Medics' Social Reps, it\nwould appear some sort of misc om muni cation in ICS MSU, and the dynamic ability of Guilds men to produce quality work on a3 am Thursday morning, has mean tour early return.\nAt this instantaneous point in\ntime, CGC U is very events orientated. The reason? Because that is\nall people notice on a physical\nlevel. Iam not in the slightest bit\nworried if at this phase in the year the events are not entirely success ful - it is good enough that we have events and people are noticing these events. Once CGC U is\nconsistently demanding public attention, for good or bad, we can unravel some more exciting products, including those that are not events orientated, which are bound to bias the good...

So are they really a couple of\ntalented young hopefuls or a pair of movie brats?\nWell, here's your chance to find out, with our very\nown interview.\nYour brain is telling you it's real and you're trying to\ntell yourself it's not so it's easy to thing it's real.\nIs it true that Heather Donahue earned a knife with\nher during the shooting of the film?\nDAN: Yeah, it was a pretty big knife. Her mom didn't want her to do the film with a bunch of strangers\nin a wood so she bought this big knife. Just in case.\nreally fortunate with an eight minute trailer we prod u ced, as John Pearson had a show called 'Split\nScreen' in New York City and wanted to air our trailer on that show so he paid us some money for\nthe rights to that and it helped us out. We didn't have to raise a lot, but $ 3 0 , 0 0 0 when you're broke\nmight as well be $ 3 0 million - but we managed to\nscrape it together.\nAre you planning to do any sequels or prequels to\nThe Blair Witch Project?\nED: We're talking to Artisan about doing another\nBlair film. It's not going to be a sequel but we have\nan idea for a prequel that is pretty cool but we're\ngoing to have to see if they're gonna let us do it or\nnot. It's really up to them. They own the film now; they own Blair Witch. It looks like they might let us\ndo it but it has to be the right time for us and the\nright time for them.\nWhat were Heather, Josh and Michael like after the\nfilm shoot?\nDAN: What you guys watch is 8 2 minutes of about\ntwenty hours of raw footage. They knew it was us\nrunning around the tent 'cos we shot the film in this\nwhole real-time format were we had the actors go out there and run this improvisation situation. The\nwhole process was an experiment. It was tough on everybody. We had a247 shoot on our side as\nwell. On one side, it was very tough and very draining but as an actor, they had the opportunity to do an eight-day play 2 4 hours a day in character with\ntotal creative freedom. They're probably never\ngonna get that opportunity again. As tiring as it was\nat the end, it was really rewarding for everybody.\nDo you know of anyone who saw the film and\nthought it was real?\nEd: A friend of ours took the movie when we had just finished editing it and popped it into his VCR at\nhome and his mom ended up watching it and he\ndidn't tell her it wasn't real. Everybody has a cam corder and as soon as a friend pops in a vacation\nvideo you're convinced it's real because there's shaky camera and the same thing works for Blair.\nWas there any inspiration from films like Man Bites\nDog and Cannibal Holocaust?\nED: I 've never actually seen ' Man Bites Dog', it's one that'son a long list of films to see when we get\nhome. As for Cannibal Holocaust we didn't find out\nthat film existed until someone at Sundance told us\nthat it had the same premise as Blair Witch. So we\nwent home and went to a video store that rent really obscure bootleg type films and we checked it out.\nIt's the exact same premise as Blair. This documentary crew goes to Peru or South America in search\nof a cannibal tribe and they find it and never get\nout. I guess they are eaten. We didn't even finish it.\nIt's pretty brutal. They kill animals on screen and that's their gore. There's one scene where we're sure\nthey use a human corpse for one of the effects.\nWhat really inspired Blair were those old documentaries. In the states they had these pseudo documentaries with Leonard Nimoy narrating about\nUFO's, Bigfoot and stuff like that and as kids Ed\nand I were terrified by those things so that was really the inspiration behind Blair.\nDo you think the film works better on the big screen\nor will it be better on video?\nEd: I think it works well on the big screen but I think\nit does work better on video. A lot of people who go to the movie say that film didn't scare them and I always write to them and say \"When the movie\ncomes out on video, rent it, go to your house alone\nat 1 am and pop it in and tell me if it scared you.\" I think it works better that way\nDid you find it easy to finance the film?\nDan: No, most of the financing was out of our own credit cards, savings, friends, and family. We were\nDid you actually attempt to show what was harassing the actors in the film?\nDan: Back to the documentaries of the seventies -there's really nothing conclusive about them. You\nsee a grainy photo of a UFO or Bigfoot running\nthrough the woods. It was the realism about those\nthings at the time that got to us. Our prime directive was to keep everything real. We didn't have the\nbudget or technical know-how to show something\nthat was convincingly real. Almost out of necessity,\nwe followed this line of keeping it real. Anything in\nthe raw footage that looked contrived; we got rid of\nit.\nDo you think you are marketing a myth or concept\nrather than just a film?\nDan: Exactly, yes. I think that's what's unique about\nBlair Witch. That it is a whole world that it is a whole\nmythology and the film you see is really just a part\nof it. It didn't start out that way but it certainly\nevolved over time. That's what I loved about Star\nWars or Star Trek. They had a whole world created\naround those films and on a small level that's what\nwe did with Blair Witch. The web site has enabled\nus to have this complementary experience that\nshowed the mythology about the movie and it was\ndefinitely this component thing of this bigger thing.\nIs the film called The Blair Witch Project after Linda\nBlair in The Exorcist?\nDan: it was named after Blair high school in Mary land and it's a good generic name that sound like\na bunch of other mythology in that area so it just\nblended in with truth. There's no reference to The\nExorcist in any way; it's just coincidence.\nHelen\n\n"

    "content": "1 November 1999 \u2022 Felix Science Feature\nBidding Wars\nDespite the negative press, Ron s angels( named, according to Mr Harris, in tribute to low grade70's cult series Charlie' s Angels), has nonetheless done amazing business, registering 1.1 million hits on it's first day alone. Of these, many will simply be visiting\nfor shock value, but nevertheless enough potential\nparents stumped up the$24.95 membership fee( required before you can bid, checkout the donors or find out more than the bar e minimum about the site)\nto push asking prices way above their starting levels.\nIndeed, even before the official launch of the \"service\", Mr Harris was offered $ 4 2 0 0 0 for the eggs of one of the models by a woman simply identified as Beth. Speaking in USA Today, the 4 2 year old TV producer explained her reasoning,\" The whole point of this is to find an egg donor who looks like me that\nway I might never have to explain the fact that I used\nsomeone else's eggs\". Man or Monster?\nRon Harris, the man responsible for the site has a past\nthat could be described as\" chequered\" at best. A one-time pornographer, director, photographer and author, he's best known for his previous venture into\ncommercial breeding he used to raise Arabian horses before selling them on for$20000 a piece. As a photographer he claims to have produced cover art-work for Vogue, Elle and Cosmopolitan, and has a lengthy career with Playboy (for who he has also directed a series of \"artistic specials\"). Ultimately, he' s a classic entrepreneur, having dabbled in every field as markets change and money shifts. A photographer in the sixties he became a purveyor of porn in the seventies, before moving into\nexercise programmes and videos in the health conscious eighties. A final flourish with the extreme edge of e commerce is thus entirely in character...\nParental Responsibility\nFrom the moment I heard about the site for the first\ntime, two questions have flashed around my head. Firstly, what kind of people would want to effectively\nbuy their child (or, perhaps more accurately, their\nchild's parent) in this way. But the second, and per-hap s more interesting, point is what kind of people would want to put themselves on the market in such away? After all, it's not like trying to sell a kidney or bone marrow to make a fast buck - we're talking\nabout selling off the rights to a child that is, biologically speaking,50% yours. Of course, hundreds of men donate to sperm banks every day, and egg donations are far from uncommon( although the process\ninvolves intensive gene therapy and complex surgery),\nbut those are( usually) anonymous. As with adoption, the donor can never know the identity of their offspring\n- or even if their offering produced a conception and so parenthood can remain an unknown, responsibility free, quantity. In this case, however, the donor must meet (and agree terms with) the buyer, and will\nforever be aware of the existence of their child, whilst\nthe couple concerned will live the knowledge of the identity of their child's true parentage. Will they,\nindeed should they, tell their child? And what happens if the child wants to get to know it's biological moth er? Indeed, in the litigation frenzy that continually\ngrips the US, what happens when one of the children\ndecides to sue that self-same mother for desertion... But back to the first point - what kind of people put their eggs up for sale? One of the models involved\nin the sale,26 year old Misty Mc Fern( who describes\nherself as a struggling actress) put it simply, \"I'd rather\ndo this than do Playboy or Penthouse\". Although morally dubious, it's a difficult point to argue, and, as she says \"I 've never even had chickenpox, mumps or measles. Don't you think those are pretty good genes to pass along?\" Moreover, it certainly isn't the models who are the victims - they get to select the winner,\nnegotiate contracts and doctors, and will keep all the\nmoney for themselves (Harris charges an additional20% commission on top of the final fee). Indeed, the site welcomes applications from would be donors you just have to be\" young, beautiful, healthy and intelligent\" to apply.\nThe Future\nIn all probability, the market ceiling will already have\nbeen reached by the time you read this, and both Har ris and his models will have made a tidy profit for their\nendeavour. But whilst they begin to prepare for the harrowing process that will lead to them fulfil ing their end of the bargain, he will be preparing for next months\nauction to goon line - this time offering the sperm of male models( at considerably lower prices). Meanwhile the US Government will begin to rush through the legislation that makes the entire concept illegal. All that\nremains to be seen is whether or not they can do so before someone matches model egg with model sperm and creates their own DIY catwalk child...\n\n"
