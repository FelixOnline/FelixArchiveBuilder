    "content": "IO\nEDUCATION\nLast Thursday tho Huxley Society\nheld a discussion on education. The\ntalk was led by Finlay D. MaFhereen.\nHe first of all gave a short talk:-\"Upon the education of the people\nof this country the fate of this country\ndepends? Disraeli's statement made in\n1&74 still rings as true today as it did\nthen. Since this field is so in port ast, so correspondingly it is wide.\nFor the purposes of this discussion we\nwill consider the e duo ation of the rul--ors of society.\nThe purpose of education is the\ndeveloping of a latent character image\nor, as Herbert Spencer said, \"Education\nhas as its object the formation ef char--actor.\" In addition to this, e duo ation is a process ef fitting a citizen to take\nup a role in society. The trouble with\neducation at present in this country is that the Government have forgotten the\nfirst aim, and concentrated on \"fitting\nout\" technologists and ether roles in\nsociety.\nThe entire soho ol system at present\nwith its specialist lines is aimed at\nproviding the country with the. quota ef\nscientists etc. it needs. This polio y was in effect stated by Sir David Socles\nwhen he o a a e te I.C.a fortnight ago.\nIn order to visualise the difference\nbet wwe n the two types of education, let\nus take an analogy. Suppose there is\na large park, completely walled in: new\nimagine a child is placed inside and\ntold that there is a gate at the ether\naide if he wants to get out. There\nare two possible ways of equipping the\nchild. Firstly, you o an give him a map\nef the way te the gate, tell him how ta\nread the map and tell him he must get\nto the gate where a prize awaits. This\ncorresponds to the English system where\nthe examination and university entrance\nis the ultimate prize. Secondly, you\ncan place the child in the field and\nsay merely, there is a gate at the other\nend ef the park. By this method the\nchild is f creed te develop*; and think\nno matter what he does; if he stays put\nhe has at least sade the decision to\nstay put, it has not been sade for his.\nThis is what is wanted is the se ho els Net as suo h special is ation and exam,\nhunting; not segregation by examination\nbut spontaneous grading as in the comprehensive school; sore emphasis on pri-nci ple s,oon oe pts and matters ef interest , *h '\u00bblr i wg rather than fao t learning\nThere is no reason for special is at ion at school ; i too ul d easily be abolished by making university degree\n0ours as longer\nIs o on ol usl on, if we do not want\nour future administrators to be narrow\nsls flos specialists worn cut at the age\nef 35 by the pace of the- competition ,\nthen the Government should start thinking of the real meaning of education ;\n\"that wh i oh fits the citizen to perform\nskillfully and magnanimously all the\naffairs both private and pub lio in both\npea oe and war\".\nIn the subsequent dissuasion the\nquestion of National Service and the\nunfortunate effects it's abolition is\nhaving wag discussed and the mixing of\nclasses and discipline were cited.\nThe teacher rj hil d relationship\nwas deplored as was the attitude af\nparents to the education of their\nchildren, \"My Johnny's leaving is oho ol when he's15; I's net having\nhim going in for all this studying\nnonsense \".\nFinally the meeting\nagreed that purely scientific\ncolleges were a bad idea and\nthat the educational policy today\nwas a shortsighted and a dangerous\npolicy.\nThe meeting was then declared\nclosed.\nFinlay D. MoFherson.\nOBITUARY\nOTIS\nGRISWOLD COFFIN\nOtis Griswold Coffin was found dead\nin nis home in Cripple. Creek, Fa. His '\ndeath had been caused by the accidental\ndischarge of his hunting rifle while he\nwas cleaning it. li r. Coffin was born at Newcomers Town\nPa. on Sept.6th.1873, the son of'Julius\nVestell and Huldah(Orcutt) Coffin. He was\ndescended from Tristram Coffin, the founder of the Coffin family in America,and\none of the first settlers in Nantucket\nIs. Mass. Little is known about the ancestry of his mother.\nHe entered the engineering college\nof the University of Wooster,Wooster,\nOhio, and received the degree of B. Sc in lie ch. Sng. He then went to the Pratt Institute where he received the degree of\na. So.\n*He served in Company H of the 5 th.\npa. Volunteer Infantry in the SpanishAmerican war and belonged! to the Veterans\nof Foreign Wars and the Spanish-American\nWar Veterans. During the World War,he\nacted as Director of sales for the Liberty\nLoan Drives in the 7th. Federal District. Mr. Coffin entered the employ of the\nTexas Pipeline Co.'as a junior engineer,\nand was assigned to the task of testing\npressure gauges,but later transferred to\nthe Chicago Rapid Transit Co. During\nthe next seven years,he was connected\nwith the Electric Axle light and Power\nCo.and the Chase Elevator and Manton\nWindlass Co. Following this,he moved\noverseas and directed operations for the\nManilla and Dagupan Railroad Co. of the\nPhillipihe Is. After two years,he returned to take the post of Executive VicePresident of the Hual Constuction Co.,\nbuilders of conduits,sewers,etc.\nHe served on the Power Test Codes\nCongressional Committee on Displacement\nCompressors,Blowers and Internal Combustion.Engines.He was a member of'the Pa,\nCharitable Mechanics Association,the\nEngineers and Professional Men's Association of N.E. Pa.j the Inventors Guild\nand the Society of Terminal Engineers.\nMr. Coffin was a Rotarian.an OddFellow,a32nd \u00bbDegree Masonand ar Member\nof the Shrine. He was also a member of\nthe Cripple Creek Country Club,the Everyman's Bible Classat the Third Prebyterian\nChuroh at Cripple Creek,the Charitable\nIrish Society,the Camp-Fire Club of America, the Sons of the Amerioan Revolution,\nthe Sons of the Colonial Wars, the Kayflower Descendants, the National Society\nof Puritan Descendants,the Society of\nColonial Wars in the Commonwealth of Pa.,\nthe vu iet Birdmen,the Blizzard lien of\n1888,and he was Chairman of the Fourminute Speakers.\nA close friend said of him:-\"When\nthe fr-at Otis Coffin saw a need.He did\nnot rest until he had satisfied it. He\nwas true to the family motto:-' If I rest,\nI rust.\nHe was predeceased by his wife,Fan-nie Floye(Dinwiddie)Coffin,and survived\nby one daughter,Lulu.\nGUILDS CARNIVAL\nOn Friday December 2nd, Guilds held their annual\ncarnival with the usual success.\nThis year's theme- Shakespearean\ncum Elizabethan, officially entitled \"MEASURE FOR PLEASURE\"\nor \"OVENOFF WITH JULIET\"\nprovided good material for both\nthe floats and the cabaret.\nThe transformation of the\nConcert Hall, which is the\ngreatest problem for the organization of any function, into the\nmain street of a sixteenth\ncentury village was most authentic. The effect of depth was\nachieved by built-out structures\nof large proportions. One was\nan olde inne-\"Ie Come & Grip\",\nnotable for its masterpieces in oil. A back cloth to the stage,\nconstructions over each door and\na village pump completed the\natmosphere. The lax morals of\nShakespeare's England were\ndepicted fully on the flats. The cabaret was a ne\u00bb.\nte part ure for Carnivals, and one\ni hat deserves far more invest ig ation. At the carnival this revue style of cabaret was put\nunder considerable difficult yone of the microphones being\nrendered inoperative. The\nwhole show had to be performed\nat shouting pitch in opposition\nto several unwelcome and\nunam us lng \"gentlemen\" who found\nentertainment in trying to ruin\nthe enjoyment of the audience,\nThe continuity of the show\nwas excellent throughout. The\nwily criticism that has been\nlevelled at the form of the acts\nis that they relied too much on\nthe spoken word for their in te rest and that an element of farce\nwould have added to the enjoyment.\nThe spirit of a carnival cabaret\nshould allow, I think, for a considerable amount of audience\nparticipation to keep up the\nfestive atmosphere.\nI would like to express my\ncongratulations to those who\nhelped produce a carnival of such\nhigh standard.\nNorman B. Greaves\nWORMY\nThe following was dictated to\nyear a as j as pearl est by two young ladies\n(Ma Bedford College who so sai fcw i loft the verses from the is ahn ri he et l.

There\nare probably two reasons for this, lack\nof adequate practise at the beginning af\nthe term caused by the polio oas e, and\nthe need to build a fresh team. Only\nfour of last year's team have survived\nto remain at College, which has meant\nthat we have had ta rely almost entirely\non this, year's fresher s.

But it must be patently obvious that less is\nknown about the numerous candidate* _\nfor the co un oil poets by those who\nchoose them as their mouthpiece, than\nwould be known about the much smaller\nnumber of candidates for the single\npost of President, i Furthermore.these\nmembers of the council' who are elected\nat Union meetings can only speak for\nthe few hundred or so who are present\nat such meetings .\nI suggest that the apparent reluctance at the top to open the flood\ngates of democracy is a reactionary\ntrait among the social cliques opposed to any reduction of their in fla eno e in the college .\nI submit that the only positive\napproach to the question is to bold\na referendum to see what proportion\nof us - the students of I.e. axe\nprepared to be responsible for electing our President democratically.\nAt present we hear only trn\nchorus ef the extrovert in d nori ty the important factor is surely the\nopinion that lies in the deep still waters of the majority.\nAssuming that tha majority vote\nto i> a in favour of a democratically\nelected president let the Oounoll\nfulfil a useful: function by org-an ising 'publicity and hustings in\nsu oha way that every member of the\nUnion will have ample opportunity\n(and interest) to form an opinion a. about the candidates.\nA democratically eleet e**p* esl-dent would help to break down the a mah deplored barrier between .the brown\nbag gers and those active in the soil-age life.

It is only when a lecture o our se is outstandingly good that one's original notes are better, for revision\npurposes, than a textbook.\nIn the Services, the aim of a training course is to teach a maximum\nof information in a minimum of time.\nThis may well be a false ideal of University education, but all the same\nthe military process is remarkably\nefficient. One of its main features is the show ing of films, which give a general picture of the subject in a vivid pictorial manner, leaving it to\nthe lecturer to fill In the mathematical details.

Dowel1.\nThe trip started at 7 p.m. on Friday 18th November with the\ndeparture by coach from the\nUnion of 34 members of the I.C.& Bedford Youth Hostel Groups.\nThe Journey to Buttermere was\nuneventful, although most theories on how to get beneficial\nsleep were disproved. Neverthel ess a200 yard. walK along a frosty road to the Youth Hostel\nserved to awaken most of us. By\nbreakfast time the sun had come\nout, and thus the various parties\nset out in high spirits. to such\nplaces as Great Gable, High Stile and Pillar. There was snow on many of\nthe tops, and with the Autumn\ntints of the lower slopes the\nviews were quite beautiful. One\nun forgetful sight was the panorama from the top of Great Gable,\nwhich included Helvellyn snow\ncapped, and with cloud just\ntouching the top. Such were the\nmurals of our rocky dining room\nas we ate our lunches of. corned\nbeef, date cake, Ryvita, etc..\nThe snow was useful as a thirst quench er and also enabled us to\nhave a snow-ball fight to use up\n\"Surplus energy\". The descent\nby way of Scarf Gap was completed just a8 dusk was falling. After supper most people adjourned to \"The Fish\" and having\nsuitably refreshed themselves,\nreturned to the hostel tired out,\nbut unwilling te admit it. To the surprise of everyone\nthe next day was also dry.\nHowever, our departure from the\nhostel was slightly delayed by\nthe disappearance of three pairs\nof boots. When they were\nfound it was stated that they\nhad been hidden because of\nalle/ged \"shining\" by their owners. Owing to a mistake the\nonly crime of the young lady\nwho owned one pair was to have\nsmall feet.\nThe Sunday was spent in similar fashion to the previous\nday, although the walks tended \u2014\nto be les3s tre nous, and\ncontained such things as a demonstration by a graduate\nengineer on how to dam a mountain stream. As tea had\nbeen arranged at \"The Fish\",\nmost people were down sufficiently early to come and partake,\nbefore the coach left at 5\no 'clock.\nThe effect of meal and pub\nstops in quick succession was\nto put most people in a jelly mood. Hence there followed a hectic hour or so, during\nwhich shoe stealing and f rie nll y fights were rife. At about\n11 o 'clock everyone settled\ndown peaceably. The coach\narrived back at I.C. at 4:30 on\nMonday morning, and it is perhaps fortunate that there\nwas aa one about to see the odd\nlooking types who got out of it. RC.S. UNION MEETING rUES.13TH.

This\ncolumn will not be used for the di sous sion of the Devlin or tho Monkton\nReports, but a few weld* on their \u2022\ntreatment of the Anderson Committee's report may not be out of 'place.\nThis committee was set up by\nthe government partly be o a use of pressure from RUS, to investigate the\nstructure of the system of awarding\nstudent grants - not, it should be\nnoted , the value of grants. It received memoranda from numerous organ-is at ions, covering every aspect of\nthis knotty problem and by February\n1960, it was reliably reported that\nthe re com end at ions were ready for\npublication. Inspired leaks Indicated\nthat one major decision of the Commitee would be that the means test\nwould be abolished a proposal wh i oh was known to run counter to Government polio y. Since there seems little point\nin appointing high powered committee's unless you intend to listen to their\nconclusions, it was optimistically\nhoped that the means test would be\nabolished in time for this session.\nHowever , for some 1jason or another\npublication- was delayed until it was\ntoo late for any change to be made for this session. Nevertheless, since\nthe oom mitte e were virtually unanimous\n(the one dissident is reported - by a usually reliable source - to have\nbeen absent from nearly all the work\nof the oom mitte e), the Government\nwere expected to implement the re oom end at ions next session.\nInstead the Government has\nannounced only a revision of tr- scales\nAllowing for the rise in most people a incomes , this revision leaves us approximately in the same state as we were\nin a few years back.\nFinally, I must say what pain the\nfinal part of their letter gave me.\nSurely the Misses Bradford cannot be\nso naive as to think that any regular\nat ten a erin the bar, would leave the\nplace where his needs could surely be\nsatisfied with a small brown, a Keg,\na Tankard, or even that most invigorating of all drinks, a Black-ana-Tan,\nto taste of the fruit of the tree of\nKnowledge of Good and Evil?

In\nhockey, it is required that one\ndoes not raise the a tick above\nones shoulder lest one should\nfella fellow player.

But never,\nuntil Friday night, have we been\nactually disgusted by it( or more correctly by some of our\nfellow-students here).\nDuring the cabaret at Guilds\nCarnival we heard a sura total of a dozen complete phrases from\nthe stage, and we were sitting one-and -a half, and three yards\nfrom it. What we did hear was\na continuous bar racking that\ncould never, by any stretch of\nthe imagination, be taken as\nintelligent audience part ici p ation.

Some\npeople might subscribe to the\nview that if a cabaret turns out\nto be... well let's say \"weak\"\nthis gives them the right to barrack. Personally we would\nbe in favour of sitting it out\nin silence, if only out of\nappreciation of the six weeks\nhard work put in by the producer,\ncast, band, etc.. However, on\nFriday we had no chance to judge\nwhether the performance was in fact, good or bad. The bad\nbehaviour certainly wasn'ta vote of censure because it started the moment the first man came\nonto the stage and from then on\nit was sheer hell. We heard not\none of the witty phrases \"from\nthe floor\" that used to be a regular feature of Carnival\ncabarets.\nPresumably some 1+0% of\nthose at the carnival were from\noutside the college, almost\ncertainly there will have been\na few for whom this was the\nfirst real association with the\nso-called \"top 3%\" who go to the university.

    "content": "f CUM THE NEWSPAPER QF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nPACKS PUNCH Friday 9th. December. 1960. No 154\nHOW fCC tX INTRODUCTION^\n- Have you ever stopped to think how\nmuch' effort is involved in producing\nthe newspaper that you are reading now?\nIt * s very doubtful. ''Most new recruits\nto the staff are absolutely amazed at\nthe amount of work which is necessary.\nIn order to give you a better idea we\nnow take you behind the scenes and for\nthe first time in Felix history we\nshow you \"how it's done.\"\nRAW MATERIAL. .\nTo start with we need raw material.\nFelix only has a few writers on its staff, we depend on you to produce\n\u2022Ost of the copy. Some people need very\nlittle prompting to pick up their pens\nand pencils. However-the vast\nmajority have to be cajoled, or even\nthreatened. This is a pity be o a use 'this newspaper should ref leo t the\nSpirit which makes the Union what it is. SUNDAY WORKING\nOnce the copy is in the hands of\nthe Felix staff it is read through\nand any errors, grammatical or other-wise, are corrected. Much of this is done as soon as the material is received. However we really get down\nto business on the Sunday before the\nFriday of issue. We begin to gather\nin the Press Room (opposite the v lift on the third, floor of the Uniua) at a time in the morning wh i oh seems to\nbe almost completely unheard of in student circles, sometimes as early\nas 7.30 a.m. \"PREPARATION OF THE COPT\nOne of the first tasks is to type\nout all the copy into columns just\naver thx a e inches \u00bbi< is.This la usually enough to keep three or four\n^.typewriters busy for seven or eight\nf coura*: \u00ab These columns are then\nInspected for mistakes. These are\ncorrected by typing out the oca*-ple te line in which the mistake occurs,\ncarefully cutting out this single line of type and pasting it over the\noriginal line. Once the oo lu ms are\no lear of mistakes they are arranged oh\nlarge white boards, each one of which\nrepresents one side of one page of the\npaper. At the same time the titles and headings of the articles, etc. are\nbeing stencilled. An average eight\npage -issue carries well over five\nhundred letters produced by this\nmethod. This keeps one person busy\nfrom about 6 p.m. almost until work\nis finished which may be as late as\n1 a.m. on Monday.\nWhen all material for one page\nis ready and the layout has been\ndetermined then the job of\"sticking\ndown' begins. With the help of\nguide lines drawn with a blue pencil\non the boards all the typewritten\ncopy, the headings, and any photographs are pasted on accurately\nwith a substance known as \"cow gum.\"\nThis is a type of rubber Solution\nwhich.allows the copy to be removed\neasily from the boards so that they\n.can be used again. Finally the\nstraight black lines are put onto the\nboards to separate the different\nArticles and* the boards are ready to be\ntaken to the printer,.\nPBDTOGRAIHING THE BOARDS\nAt the printers'premises each\nboard is marked accurately with\ncentering lines, one horizontal,one\nvertical, and then set up before a camera eleven feet long. High\ncontrast ortho chr cm at ice film is used\nso that our blue guide lines do not\nappear on the finished newspaper. Then\nall the photographs in the paper are\nremoved from the boards and photographed\nseparately on half-tone film so that in the finished newspaper they' render a correct tone contrast.\nMAKING THE PLATESOnce the films have o een developed\nand dried the half-tone or \"screen\"\nfilm is cut up and the pieces are\ninserted into windows cut into the\nhigh-contrast or \"line\" film,thus making a negative equal in size to the page\nwhich you are reading now. .Should our\nwork at I.C. not be up to standard, and\nthis is very often the case, then these\nContinued on page two:\nMONDAY IS BLOOD DONATION DAY "

    "content": "MOCK PARLIAMENT Already tills term we have had\nthe first In the series of four Mock\nParliaments. At this, we had a Labour\nGovernment with a Liberal Opposition,\nthe Conservatives and Communists being\nuncommitted back-bench ers. The debate\nwas divided into two s eot ions i Question\nTime, which was mainly an attack on the\nParliamentary Labour Party's two-way\nposition on defence, and the presentation of a Bill on Education. The latter led to some lively exchanges on\nComprehensive and Public Schools.\nEarly next term, probably at 7.0.\np.m. on January 10th., the next iibc k Parliament will be held, with a Liberal Government and Communist Opposition. The main topic under discussion will be Home Rule. Everyone who\nthinks - or doesn't think - on this\nsubject is welcome to attend and add\nto the discussion, irrespective of\ntheir political or non-political op in ions, or whether they come from Pair\nIsle, Birmingham, or the Falkland Isles.\nRAILWAY SOC. by t f.N. King.\nOn Wednesday 23rd November,\n6 members of the Society travel* led out to Amersham, for a trip in the brake-van of the afternoon\nlocal goods train on the\nMetropolitan line to Harrow.\nThe inspector at Amersham\nreceived us, having been\nsummoned from his office by an,\n\"Oi\", from the gum-chewing and\noverweight ticket collector. He\ntold us that the train would not\nleave for some time as he thought\nthere was no guard. Someone then\nquoted the departure time given\nin the working timetable. \"Ah\",\nsaid the inspector, \"but you\ncan't, go by that, can you?\"\nOur guard eventually\nalighted from a goods train, passing in the other direction,\nand we started off. We could\nA BRAKE have ridden inside the van, but\nbeing railway maniacs, we rode\non the front balcony, which\nenabled us to take photos and\nsee more, although we nearly\nfroze.\nWe spent about half an\nhour at Chalfont & Latimer,\nshunting into a siding, while\nvarious main line trains went\nby. After a few signal stops,\nwe steamed majestically\nthrough Rickmansworth without\nstopping, and from Moor Park\nto Harrow, we had a wonderful\nview of the works in progress\nin widening the line from 2 to\n4 tracks. Finally our freight\ntra\"in made a special stop in the middle of Harrow station\nand we dismounted to the\ninterested stares of hordes\nof schoolgirls on the opposite\nplatform.\nMORPHYMANIA SEQUEL\nThe Baiter,\nFelix.\nDear Sir,\nX am sere that \u00ab y fei r person en\nthe ten path at Putney en Morphy Day will\nagree mat Mei'e aja a a la was a good t it l far the burbling* of the President ft t R.C.S. an the afternoon's events.
