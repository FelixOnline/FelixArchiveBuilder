    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nOne billion hungry: can we\nJula Humphries interviews Sir Professor Gordon Conway about foo\nimportant role of women in Africa, the role of students, especially engi\nJula Humphries: What are the key\nthreats to global food security?\nProfessor Sir Gordan Conway: The\nthree main challenges we\u2019ve got at the\nmoment are: food price spikes, the\npersistence of a billion or more people su\ufb00ering from chronic hunger and\nthe need to feed a growing population\nin the face of a wide range of adverse\nfactors.\nThe \ufb01rst challenge is food price\nspikes; that is every few years the price\nof food suddenly shoots up to a big\nhigh and then collapses. We\u2019ve had\ntwo since 2007 and we are into the\nthird one now, but we don\u2019t know how\nhigh it is going to go. The importance\nof these is that they a\ufb00ect the poor\ndisproportionately. The poor spend\na high proportion of their income,\noften half of all the money they earn,\non food, and often the price stays high\nlike that so that\u2019s one big challenge.\nThe second is that we\u2019ve got nearly a\nbillion people hungry today, we don\u2019t\nknow exactly how many, there may be\n800 million or a billion, and the most\nshocking statistic there is that we\u2019ve\ngot 180 million children hungry, under the age of \ufb01ve, who are malnourished \u2013 that means they are stunted,\nthey are a low height for their age, and\nthat happens in the \ufb01rst thousand days\nof life in other words pregnancy plus\ntwo years. If they do not get the right\nfood, in particular having the right mi-cronutrients like vitamin A, zinc and\niron and so on. Without these micro-nutrients they are stunted, there are\n180 million children like this in the\nworld.\nThe third big challenge is that we\u2019ve\ngot to feed the word by 2050, now part\nof that is population increase. Population is going to go up by thirty per cent\nor more, it is going to go up to nine\nand a half billion. Population increase\nis probably just about manageable in\nterms of increasing food but the big issue is not the increase in population\nbut the increase in per capita incomes,\nparticularly in growing countries. The\nrapidly growing countries like China,\nIndia and Brazil, termed high growth\ncountries. Those counties are shifting\ntowards more western style diets; this\nmeans people are eating more bread,\nwheat and livestock products. The\npoint is the livestock all require feed,\nthe cows, the sheep and the goats and\nthe chickens all require feed. So, you\nhave got to produce a lot more grain\nfor that. For example if you produce\none kilo of meat, it takes eight kilos of\ngrain, roughly.\nSo that is a big challenge. On top of\nthat is the challenge that comes from\ncompetition with biofuels. If you grow\nmaize, corn. If you grow corn it gets\nsold for human food, animal feed and\nfor biofuels. There is big competition\nthere, which we have got to cope with.\nThe land is degraded and the water\nis degraded through overuse, pollution and so on. And most important\nof all is climate change. We have got\nincreasing temperatures, reduced\nrainfall in some places. That is a\ufb00ecting food production. And then every\nnow and again an extreme event like\nthe big drought that occurred in the\nUnited States this year or the big heat\nwave and drought in Russia in 2010\nor the big \ufb02ooding in Pakistan also in\n2010. To cope with all of this food production has to double. We have got\nthe same amount of land but we have\ngot to increase yields. Increase yields\non the same amount of land, using less\nwater, applying less fertiliser, applying less pesticides and producing less\ngreenhouse gases, methane, nitrous\noxide and carbon dioxide so that\u2019s the\nbig challenge. The book is about that,\nhow to tackle it \u2013 technology and different methods.\nJH: How to balance the di\ufb00erent\ntechnologies with more traditional\nfarming methods also cost as well,\nwhich is the cost bene\ufb01t ratio of\nwhat is the best way forward?\nGC: We have basically got four kinds\nof technology, traditional ones, conventional technologies, intermediate\nones, which are combined traditional\nand conventional technologies and\nthen you platform technologies which\nconsist of ICT and biotechnology, soft\ninfrastructure, and nanotechnology.\nNo one of those are any better than\nthe other, it depends on what works in\nwhat circumstances, so you\u2019ve got to\nlook at the environment, social envi-ronment, the economic environment\nand the housing environment and see\nwhich one works. Don\u2019t be prejudice\nabout what kind of environment you\nare going to start with. De\ufb01nitely the\nway forward is a combination of tech-nologies. Remember you have to judge\neach area individually. That\u2019s quite a\nchallenge. The spatial scale must be\nconsidered to.\nLet\u2019s for example take the example\nof increasing nutrition, for poor people in particular women and children.\nThen it is good to say have a garden\nround the home, where you grow lots\nof di\ufb00erent crops, you have crops,\n\ufb01sh and chickens and so on. That will\nimprove the nutrition. But if you are\ntrying to increase the total amount of\nrice available in a country, particularly\nin Africa. Then you may need large\nirrigation schemes. They are planning one like that in Mozambique to\nproduce high quantities of rice and\nthere you would use very advanced\ntechnologies to make that work. So, in\nthat case a family could purchase the\nrice and supplement it with food from\nhome.\nIf the woman of the house has a\ncouple of hectares she may be able to\ngrow a crop to sell as well, she may\nbe able to grow some sugarcane or\nbananas for income. What you have\nto keep on remembering is that poor\nfarmers need cash, they need cash to\nget there kids into school, need cash\nfor medicines and they need cash for\nbuying food. In many cases they don\u2019t\nproduce enough food, so for small\nfarmers they really have to \ufb01nd a way\nof earning money, either from selling\nthings o\ufb00 their farm or from working as farm labourers or from getting\nsome other kind of job in the local\ncommunity.\nJH: How interconnected have the\nfood and \ufb01nancial markets become?\nJoachim von Braun outlined how to\ndeal with these issues, for example\nintroducing the grain reserves in\nNigeria and Kenya. Do you think\nthis is the way forward?\nGC: I think we need more reserves.\nThe world food programme needs bigger reserves but also individual countries need more reserves but I think\nthe priority we have been pushing recently is that you need better regional\ntrade. In other words, you need to be\nable to trade grain between Kenya,\nUganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and so on.\nA similar system to the interconnected\nEuropean Union is required in Africa.\nThere are many barriers to that, for instance political or infrastructural.\nJH: Is the Fairtade movement a way\nforward to increase food security?\nIs it feasible to increase the Fairtrade market, it is only a very small\npercentage of the market currently.\nWhat do you think?\nGC: I think it is. I think it\u2019s interesting\nthat Fairtrade is quite popular among\nconsumers, at least in Britain. People\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\n10\nSir Professor Gordon Conway\n\n"

    "content": "LOLCAT OF TEH WEEK: Finding these is a perk of the job\nTim Arbabzadah\nEditor-in-Chief\nDutch courage\nThe Holland Club has closed. The\nspace will be redeveloped by College\nand Commercial Services into something new. Apparently, everyone was\ncrying out for more food outlets. Dinner and such.\nSo what will become of the space,\nnow called Level 0? Well, Eastside 2.0\nis what I hope it doesn\u2019t become. We\nalready have one of those, why add\nanother in a slightly different location.\nI also really hope someone \u201ctrendy\u201d\ndoesn\u2019t think Level 0 is a postmodern,\nclever name to call it.\nSo, here\u2019s a solution that I think\nsounds sensible. If there was a massive need for more catering places\nthen why not do two things: 1. Make\nwhat you have better and more efficiently run. 2. Work with the Holland\nClub to keep it there as it is and just\nadd pub food at lunch and dinner.\nSeems like a really simple solution re-ally. I mean, you have a pub, you want\nfood. It isn\u2019t a stretch to say that you\ncould convert that pub into one that\nserves pub food.\nApparently there wasn\u2019t the facility for that. The obvious solution is to\ntear down the place and completely\nrebuild it. I\u2019m joking, that\u2019s not the obvious solution.\nTo me at least, the solution is to create the facilities you need to make\npub food (oven and stuff in other, less\ngrand sounding, terms than \u201cfacilities\u201d).\nAll that would have needed to be\ndone would have been to say to the\nHolland Club that they have to provide\nfood, and then help them provide food.\nCollege could have just worked together with the Holland Club to make\na kitchen. If the Holland Club didn\u2019t\nhave the money, then College could\nhave paid for it and then recouped the\nexpenses by taking a cut of the profits\nmade by the Holland Club.\nYeah, it would cost the College a\npenny or two, but it would have made\nback the money in the end. Crucially, it\nwould also have meant that the whole\nlong affair (tempted to use the word\nomnishambles) would not have been\nforced to occur. Plus, it would cost a\nlot less than studying, taking it down,\nstarting again, and then rebuilding\nand running it. The added benefit to\nCollege is that they don\u2019t even need\nto run the place: that\u2019s done for them\nby the Holland Club. They just provide\nthe initial funding (if needed) and then\nsit back and let the money roll in back\nto them. Maybe someone should do a\nfeasibility study on that?\nPerhaps the solution would mean\nthat the College would feel like they\nwouldn\u2019t have a say in the matter at\nall. Well, people can work together\ncan\u2019t they? Plus they could stipulate\nthat if it starts loosing money (which\nis a criteria of \u201csuccess\u201d I guess) then\nthey step in and change a few things.\nThen there would be no closure\nand no staff and students being an-noyed, and no Club with no room.\nThere would be a nice pub to eat food\nin for post graduates, and everyone is\na winner.\nI honestly don\u2019t see why the Holland\nClub and College can\u2019t work together\nto renovate the space a bit (sorry, but\nthe toilets could use a bit of a refur-bishment) and re-open it, with similar\ndecor and atmosphere, as the Holland\nClub, but with added food at lunch\nand dinner times. In fact, the doors\naren\u2019t bolted yet, so surely there\u2019s still\ntime for this?\nWhat saddens me really is that in a\nfew years everyone will forget that the\nHolland Club existed there. It\u2019ll be a\nmere curiosity. There\u2019ll be no outrage\nand upset then. Of course the people\nin College will know that. They\u2019ll know\nthat they can waltz in and no-one will\nremember it years later. Build it and\nthey will come. People will go to it because it\u2019s there, it\u2019s going to be not too\nexpensive, and it\u2019ll be convenient.\nTime will tell if the Holland Club will\nmove to a new location.\nClubs & Socs POLITICS SPORT\nThe return...

Ned Yoxall speaks to Dr Jane Davies, the clinical lead investigator in London, to \ufb01nd\nout more.\nNed Yoxall: Thanks so much for\nagreeing to meet! Could you tell me\na little about your background \u2013\nhow did you end up in cystic \ufb01brosis\n(CF) research?\nDr Jane Davies: It\u2019s a bit of a random\nstory! I went to medical school in\nDundee before coming to London\nwhere I did a series of paediatric clinical jobs with a particular interest in infectious diseases. Before long I found\nmyself at the Royal Brompton doing a\nrespiratory and cardiac job, and this\nis where I had my \ufb01rst contact with\nCF patients. The CF lung is full of in-fection, so I ended up doing an M.D.\nlooking at how bacteria stick onto the\nepithelial cells. After a spell at Great\nOrmond Street, I came back to this\njob \u2013 a combination of a clinical consultant and an academic \u2013 where I\u2019ve\nbeen for the last 12 years.\nNY: Could you give me a brief dummy\u2019s overview of what CF does to the\nbody?\nJD: CF is a genetically inherited dis-ease, so if a patient has two copies\nof the abnormal gene then the cells\nlining the organs of their body don\u2019t\nhandle salt well. The mishandling of\nthe salt leads to dehydration of the\nsurface secretions \u2013 particularly in\nthe lungs \u2013 so they become dry and\nsticky. They then act as a very attractive place for bugs and viruses entering the body. This triggers an in\ufb02ammatory response, but the infection is\nnever properly cleared, so you enter a\nvicious cycle of chronic infection and\nin\ufb02ammation which leads to tissue\ndamage and other di\ufb03culties.\nNY: So what\u2019s it like to live with CF?\nJD: Well I don\u2019t know that \ufb01rst hand,\nso no matter how well I know my patients I can never pretend to know\nexactly how they feel. It is certainly\nvery di\ufb03cult both practically and\npsychologically though. Practically,\na huge amount has to be done every\nday to manage the disease \u2013 up to an\nhour a day of physiotherapy to clear\nmucous from the lungs, as well as\nnebuliser treatments and between ten\nand twenty di\ufb00erent pills to be taken.\nThat\u2019s when things are going well, and\nalmost all patients go through episodes where they need to be in hospital for several weeks at a time. Psychologically, it\u2019s completely relentless\nand it\u2019s something that you know will\nbe with you for the rest of your life and\nyou know that your life will be considerably shortened \u2013 life expectancy is\nin the late thirties at the moment.\nNY: What is the Gene Therapy Consortium, and what\u2019s it trying to do?\nJD: It\u2019s an amalgamation of three individual groups \u2013 Imperial, Oxford and\nEdinburgh \u2013 which had previously\nbeen working in competition, but were\nbrought together by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust to work in collaboration. The\naim was to bring a step change in gene\ntherapy trials where success would be\nmeasured by how patients actually felt\nor performed after treatment rather\nthan by molecular markers in the lab.\nNY: Has gene therapy been attempted in the past?\nI\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\n20\n\u201c\n\u201d\nCF is physically exhaust-ing; psychologically it\u2019s\ncompletely\nrelentless\n\u201c\n\u201d\nOur approach\nuses synthetic liposome-based vectors to deliver\nDNA\nJD: Yes \u2013 for lots of di\ufb00erent diseases.\nIt\u2019s been really successful at treating\nsome cancers and immunode\ufb01ciency\ndisorders, but gene therapy trials for\nCF have never been big enough or\nlong enough to look for clinical bene\ufb01ts before now.\nNY: What makes it so di\ufb03cult to\nachieve?\nJD: Lots of gene therapy approaches\nuse a virus to carry the experimental gene into the cells. Viruses can be\nquite good at this and for some diseases it works really well as one viral\n\u201chit\u201d can be a treatment for life. The\nproblem with cystic \ufb01brosis is that\nyou need to treat the lungs, which\nconstantly renew themselves, so you\ncan\u2019t easily target a stem cell \u2013 you\nneed to give the treatment repeatedly,\nand unfortunately the viruses are targeted by the body\u2019s immune system.\nSo although you can get excellent gene\ntransfer the \ufb01rst time, by the third or\nfourth time, with most viruses at least,\nit drops to nothing.\nCF necessitates the frequent use of\nbreathing mask nebulisers\nInterested in interviewing\nfor Felix Science?\nHave you wanted to have a go at interview-ing, but not felt confident enough? Get in\ntouch with Felix Science and we can help\nset you on your way. Contact us at science.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFacebook facebook.com/Felixscience\nlife123.com\n... it\u2019s less effective than\nusing viruses,\nbut can be\nused repeat-edly.\nNY: What\u2019s di\ufb00erent about your approach now?\nJD: We\u2019re not using viruses to carry\ngenes into the cells. Instead we\u2019re\nusing synthetic vectors based on li-posomes which fuse with the fatty cell\nwall and allow the new DNA to get\ninto the nucleus. This process is almost certainly less e\ufb03cient than using\nviruses, but you can do it repeatedly.\nNY: What\u2019s the best case scenario\nafter this trial?\nJD: The best case scenario would be a\nhighly signi\ufb01cant increase in the lung\nfunction of those having undergone\ngene therapy. This would be the \ufb01rst\nevidence that the approach works with\nCF and it would then be taken forward\nwith a collaborating pharmaceutical\npartner to develop a treatment.\nNY: And the worst?\nJD: That it doesn\u2019t work at all. While\nthis would be disappointing, we do\nhave a second wave using a di\ufb00erent\napproach, which in fact is a very unusual virus that can be given repeatedly.\nA negative trial certainly wouldn\u2019t\nmean the end of gene therapy for CF.\nNY: What does the trial mean for\npeople with CF?\nJD: Well I\u2019m very careful not to use\nthe word cure. Even if it is successful,\nit will still need to be given repeatedly\nand will only treat the lungs, not the\nother organs which are a\ufb00ected. It\ncould, however, be a major move forward and so there is a lot of optimism\nabout it.\nNed completed Ironman Wales back\nin September to raise money for the\nCystic Fibrosis Trust.

Poor farmers are getting more of the value added\nthan they would otherwise and I think\nthat is true. Fairtrade works di\ufb00erently\nin di\ufb00erent countries and it is more\nsuccessful in some places than in others but the important thing is that\nmore of the bene\ufb01t has to go to the\nfarmer and the farming community.\nI think in many cases there is a power imbalance. What you have to do,\nyou have to help farmers form co-op-eratives, and contract farmer groups,\nso that they have got the power of being part of a co-operative and doing\nthe deals with the big companies. Cooperatives for example have been developed in the Netherlands, for example all the milk in the Netherlands is\nproduced by co-operatives. And those\nco-operatives are all quite strong.\nThey can therefore bargain in terms of\nthe money they need. We need to get\nmore of that working for example in\nAfrica. In fact there is a Dutch bank\ncalled Rabba Bank, which is a very excellent co-operative bank, built up of\nlots of little co-operative banks. They\nnow work in Africa helping farmers\nto create co-operatives, that\u2019s working\nquite well.\nFarmers in strong co-operatives,\nwith strong leaders to support can\nbargain and get the value they need\nand deserve.\nJH: Professor Conway, you have\nwritten about how important the\nrole of women is in Africa. Could\nyou tell us a bit about this?\nGC: Fundamentally we must realise\nthat nearly half the farmers in Africa\nare women and they have enormous\npotential, not just as farmers but also\nas mothers because they determine\nwhat children eat, so they can improve\ntheir nutrition. They can also be innovators and educators too. Basically,\nwomen are farmers, mothers, educators and innovators.\nMore must be done to support women in these roles, a lot of it is about empowering women\u2019s\u2019 group for example\nthrough WARM, which works in Eastern Africa. WARM is way of ensuring\nwomen have a stronger voice to a\ufb00ect\npolicies. In many cases, the most important thing is when a programme\nor project is designed whether it is by\nthe government or NGOs or the private sector. You have to ensure there\nis a target for women\u2019s right from the\nbeginning, in other words you don\u2019t\njust add it on at the end. In fact that\nis true of nearly everything we have\nbeen talking about here. You don\u2019t just\nsay we will have a yield increase and\nthen we\u2019ll make it stable. Or we\u2019ll have\ngrowth and then later on you think\nwell we ought to do something about\nresilience. There must be growth plus\nresilience from the beginning. There\nmust be yield plus stability of yield\nfrom the beginning. You\u2019ve got to have\nand increase in production and increased value added from the bottom\nfrom the beginning. All of this plus\nempowerment of women must occur\nfrom the beginning. Don\u2019t treat wom-en, or the environment or resilience\nas add-ons, which they often are. Oh\nmy goodness, we\u2019ve forgotten about\nwomen let\u2019s dump something in. You\ndon\u2019t want to do that, we have to make\nsure it is there from the beginning.\nJH: Are there are any schemes encouraging people to return and invest in their home countries? Do we\nneed more of a focus on this?\nGC: Yes, there are schemes like this.\nAt the Rockefeller foundation we had\na programme on biotechnology in\nAsia and many went back. A lot of it\nwas because in addition to supporting\nthe individuals to do their training,\nyou were supporting the institutions\nfrom which they came and when they\nwent back there was money given to\nthose institutions so they could continue to do their research.\nJH: What do you think the role of\nstudents is in this? Have you heard\nof Raincatcher, where engineering\nstudents go to Tanzania every year\nto build rain harvesting systems?\nGC: I think getting students to go and\nhelp and work in villages is excellent.\nIt is excellent for them, for they learn a\nlot more. What is important, that every time you do something like this you\nthink about the sustainability of what\nyou are doing. In a sense, it is like the\nold parable; you can give people \ufb01sh to\neat and feed them for a day but teach\na man to \ufb01sh and you feed him for a\nlifetime. It is very important that when\nstudent groups work in a developing\ncountry, that what they are doing is\nhelping to put something into place\nthat will continue long after they are\ngone. So, they work with the commu-nity; it is about learning together. It is\nvery important to not assume that we\ngo to a place and teach them what to\ndo for most poor communities know\nvery well what they should be doing.\nAnd if you talk with them, particularly\nif you use participatory rural appraisal\nPRA, through using such techniques\nthe farmers themselves become very\nclear about what needs to be done.\nThen you consider what can be done\nto break down these barriers together\nand then you work it through. That is\nwhat the approach should be.\nJH: A slightly silly question: what\nevery day object would you genetically modify? Tim Arbabzadah said\nhe would create a bottomless cup of\ntea.\nGC: I would create an email system\nthat answered every email on my behalf without me having to look at it.\nThe annual \u2018Carbon show\u2019, that took\nplace at London\u2019s Business Design\nCentre this October, is a chance for\nindustry-types and Carbon a\ufb01cionados to network, mingle and promote.\nHowever, what was advertised as \u2018 the\nleading annual event on energy e\ufb03ciency and the low carbon economy\u2019\npresented a very dire image of the\ncarbon economy. The Carbon Show\nshrunk to around 1/3 of its size from\nlast year, to only having around twenty\nexhibitors (and last year\u2019s event was\nin itself still somewhat underwhelm-ing, with many stallholders leaving\ndissatis\ufb01ed). The exhibitors this year\nincluded consultants, certi\ufb01cation\ncompanies and veri\ufb01ers; although really it appeared to just focus on companies with the name Carbon in them:\nCarbon Clear, Carbon Credentials,\nThe Carbon Trust, Carbon Advice\nGroup. Presentations and Seminars\nran throughout the day on energy ef\ufb01ciency, carbon investment and green\ntechnologies. These represented companies and organisations ranging from\nJaguar Land Rover to King\ufb01scher Plc,\nRBS and the Energy Saving Trust. Although informative and sometimes\nenjoyable, the entire show seemed\nmarked from the very beginning by\nthe sense of a lacklustre under-perfor-mance.\nIt seems that a lack of political certainty around climate change and the\nrecession appears to have drastically\nimpacted businesses. The Carbon\nTrust, one of the key sponsor\u2019s of the\nevent, have lost most of their government funding and are now, it appears from the waves of redundancies,\nstruggling to establish themselves in\nthe private sector. A further stall, T\u00dcV\nNORD, a German based validation,\nveri\ufb01cation and certi\ufb01cation com-pany, mentioned how the uncertainty\nof post-Kyoto agreements were hurting their business, speci\ufb01cally their\nwork of verifying Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism projects under the EU emission\ntrading scheme. It wasn\u2019t all bad news,\nEco-desk, an online platform for companies to promote the measures they\nhave taken to be sustainable in their\nindependent operations, appeared to\nbe on the rise and enjoying the day\u2019s\nsteady tra\ufb03c.\nAlthough I walked out of the event\nfeeling depressed about my future\ncareer prospects, this smaller, more\nintimate carbon show was actually\nsurprisingly quite appealing. As Karen Hayward from Carbon Leapfrog\nsaid \u201cit is a lot smaller than last year\nbut it lends itself to more meaningful\nconversations\u201d. Indeed, the importance to maintain the spaces whereby\ndebate can \ufb02ourish, and these signi\ufb01cant global problems can be dia-logically worked out cannot be over-emphasised. Perhaps what is needed\nis a re-orientation; a move away from\nbusinesses and move towards a mutually bene\ufb01cial environment that\nbrings together businesses in a more\nacademic-conference style setting. So,\ndespite the year on year shrinking size\nof the event, I would recommend students to attend next years - that is if it\nis still running and you can avoid the\nsteep prices.\nTo register: http://www.thecarbon-show.com/register/\nRoll up, roll up, for the Carbon Show\nAntonia Weitzer Writer\nthecarbonshow.com\nApparently the person making\nthe sign sent a newspaper headline about a company drawing\nup plans for a building rather\nthan the centre name.

    "content": "The Green Party: today and tomorrow\nThe Green Party has been a part of\nBritish politics since 1972 with the\nformation of PEOPLE and currently\nexists as 3 parties corresponding to\nthe devolved partitions of England/\nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n40 years in, and the Green Party is by\nfar the largest environmental political\nparty in the UK, and even gained its\n\ufb01rst MP, with Caroline Lucas winning\nBrighton Pavilion in the 2010 General\nElection.\nWith environmentalism being at the\nfront and centre of modern politics,\nthe last 10 years have represented a\nwatershed era for the Greens. On one\nhand, there are signi\ufb01cant votes available for green policy, which has long\nbeen their domain; on the other, the\nmainstream parties have leapt into the\nfray desperately trying to prove that\nthey can hug trees harder than their\nRight Honourable opponents. This is\nprobably best illustrated by the worst\nillustration in modern politics where\nsomeone with the artistic \ufb02air of a\n5-year old (my guess is Boris Johnson)\ntook a crayon and drew a \u201ctree\u201d as the\nnew symbol of the oldest political party in the world.\nConsidering the Greens have recently been forced into a policy turf war\nwith the heavyweights of parliament,\nit is probably fair to say they have done\nbetter than many would have expect-ed. By embracing any green policy\nproposed by any side (admittedly often alongside the caveat that such a\npolicy is a step in the right direction,\nbut does not go far enough), they have\nbeen happy to encourage talk and put\npolicy over politics, resisting the urge\nto ascend a lofty stallion. This strategy\nobviously ran the risk of rendering\ntheir party obsolete if the opposition\ntruly embraced measures to save the\nenvironment, so it is commendable\nthat the Greens didn\u2019t roll their eyes\nand claim that they were still the only\ntrue environmentalists.\nMs Lucas\u2019 step up to the Commons\nrepresents a monumental step for an\nenvironmental party in the UK, and\nwas as every bit as \u201chistoric\u201d as she\nclaimed at the time. She has been\na very active member, voting in an\nabove-par three quarters of available\nvotes during her time in the com-mons. Additionally she has made an\nimpressive 70 speeches during already\nthis year and proposed 71 motions.\nHowever, for all this, it is fair to say\nthe Greens have not stamped their authority on British politics. They have\nmade strides, recently even, but they\nhave failed to make much of an impact\nA good case study for the UK Greens\non how to be environmental and still\nsuccessful is Die Gr\u00fcnen of Germany\nwho have been a force since the early\n80s in West Germany.\nFirstly, Die Gr\u00fcnen\u2019s rise to prominence was driven by an iconic and\npopular \ufb01gurehead. Joschka Fischer\nresonated with the people through\na forthright and honest approach to\npolitics cutting through the PR speak\nprevalent in modern politics (po-litely describing the Vice President an\na**hole to his face and outright calling\nthe Americans liars when presented\nwith \u201cevidence\u201d of WMDs in Iraq).\nTaking his inauguration in trainers\nis still an infamous and amusing moment that most Germans will recall.\nCaroline Lucas may have risen to the\nstatus of household name in the last\nthree years, but she has not had the\nreformed rebel charisma of Fischer.\nWithout such an icon a la Fischer/\nBlair/Thatcher (hell, even a Johnson\nor a Farage would do) then the Greens\nare unlikely to be listened to in today\u2019s\npolitics.\nSecondly and arguably more im-portantly, Die Gr\u00fcnen\u2019s base is split\nbroadly into two camps, the ideological environmentalist (the fundis) and\nthe model politicians who are willing\nto play the game of the Bundestag to\npass legislation (the realos). They attribute their success to this inherent\nschism within the party. The fundis as\na party unto themselves would never\nhave the political nous to have an\nimpact on legislation, whilst a party\nconsisting of purely realos would inevitably meander away from their\nprinciples. Together they form a party\nwith both a concept driven supporter-base and the means to enact change.\nIn comparison, the Greens are currently fundi-only. Speaking as a scien-tist, my \ufb01rst thought when turning my\nmind to the actions of the Green party\nin recent years is that of Jenny Jones\nthreatening to go and destroy mil-Adam Clancy Writer\nPOLITICS\n17\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\nPolitics Editors: Padraic Calpin\nMarie-Laure Hicks\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nlions of pounds of perfectly safe GM\nresearch crops. The plants in question\nhad virtually no chance to contaminate the environment, and simply enhanced a naturally produced chemical\nto ward o\ufb00 pests, saving farmers from\n\ufb02ooding their land with truly damaging pesticides. This was vocal fundi\nenvironmentalist\u2019s wailing against the\ntrue environmentalists of this scenario \u2013 the scientists.\nFor the record, the people who claim\nall Greens are science hating luddites\nare liars. However, the majority of the\nGreens are people who take a di\ufb00erent view of environmentalists to the\noverwhelmingly environmentalist scienti\ufb01c community, particularly with\nregards to genetics and animal testing.\nThis does not make either side right,\nbut it does make their opinions skewed\nand unrelatable to a large block of potential voters. Unfortunately this is a\nsymptom, not the problem. The probheUK\u2019scurrentstanceonGreenpolicyismixedatbest:despiteCoalition\npledges to be the \u2018Greenest Government Ever\u2019, Cameron and Clegg have\ncome under repeated fire, whether over the planned \u2018Dash for Gas\u2019, or\nthe Tory energy minister insisting on challenging the coalition policy on\nonshore Wind Farms. And yet, there\u2019s been a spate of positive news too.\nKyoto Targets Met\nIn a surprising story, the Guardian reported at the end of last month that last\nyear, the UK actually made the biggest cuts in emissions of any EU nation, well\nexceeding its Kyoto target for the year. Emissions fell 6%, driven by mild weather,\na sluggish economy and a small increase in renewables generation.\nThe EU as a whole is also exceeding its Kyoto target, despite individual nations\nsuch as Spain and Italy failing to meet their personal cuts. Despite the lack of a\nglobal deal at the 2009 Copenhagen summit, the EU is also on track to meet its\ntarget cut of 20% by 2020 agreed three years ago.\nGreenest Games Ever\nThe first report into the sustainability efforts of LOCOG and the 2012 Olympic\nGames found that the Games are on course to meet their sustainability targets,\nmaking them the \u201cGreenest Ever\u201d. As well as sending no waste to landfill and\nreusing, recyling or composting 70% of all waste, 20% reductions in carbon\nemissions are also on track. The report says that with better planning, even greater\nreductions could have been made, but praised the efforts of the UK.\nT\nPadraic Calpin\nUK\u2019s Green Success\nlem for the Greens is much bigger.\nThe Greens will never get into pow-er. Sorry, but it\u2019s true. They are not\nLabour, they are not Tories but they\nare competing in a \ufb01rst-past-the-post\nsystem. The Greens will never have\nenough seats to make a di\ufb00erence in\nour electoral system so the realos who\nwant to actually make a di\ufb00erence\ndon\u2019t join the Greens, but (usually)\njoin Labour. This leaves a now even\nless electable fundi-dominated Green\nparty who become less appealing to\nthe voting masses.\nWhat they needed was someone\nto stand up and \ufb01ght for an undeniably superior system (the one from\nGermany would be nice). What they\ndidn\u2019t need was someone to try to get\nPR, only to fail in such a spectacularly\npathetic manner.

Tree spiking, arson and even bombing\nare methods used by environmentalist groups to express their point. Radical\nenvironmentalists are often associated to anti-capitalism and a general belief that\ncapitalismandthepatriarchalsocietyareresponsiblefordamaginganddestroying\nnature.\nOne of the most well known radical eco-groups is ELF.

Unusually for London in November, the sun\u2019s rays play across the\ncity, giving relief from the slight chill\nin the air. The lack of any discernible\ntension in the air conceals the fact\nthat the area will soon see the commencing of the 2012 British Shorinji\nKempo Federation (BSKF) Taikai\nCompetition.\nAlthough generally non-compet-itive, Shorinji Kempo, a Japanese\nmartial art that combines striking\ntechniques with throws and pins,\ndoes occasionally hold tournaments\nin order to showcase its practitioners\u2019 skill. Since its inception, Imperial\nCollege dojo \u2013 training under the expert tutelage of Sensei Sean Dixie \u2013\nhas been feared throughout the land\nfor the intensity and \ufb02air of its martial artists. Indeed, more than one\nSaturday afternoon training session\nhas elicited complaints from neighbouring residents due to the noise\nemanating from the Union Gym.\nWith a sharp call to attention, the\nday\u2019s contest began. A quick, group\nwarm-up receded into the opening\nceremony and without any pause\nto catch breath the audience was\nthrown straight into a heady maelstrom of competition.\nOpening proceedings was the kumi\nembu category, where a choreographed \ufb01ght sequence is performed\nby two competitors. Imperial\u2019s entrants were the maverick duo of Maksim Mijovic and Aditya Narayanan,\ndubbed \u2018The Flying Moustaches\u2019 for\ntheir matching, Movember-inspired\nmoustaches (http://uk.movember.\ncom/team/563989, in case anyone\nis interested). A frenetic 90 seconds\nof action unfolded, trans\ufb01xing the\naudience who gasped and groaned\nat the audacity and \ufb02amboyance on\ndisplay. The main challenge for the\ntitle came from Cambridge dojo, responding with a slick, polished \ufb01ght\nshowing no less ability. The judges\ndeliberated for what seemed like an\neternity on what was a tough-fought\ncategory, but although Cambridge\nwas a worthy contender for the top\nslot, Imperial\u2019s superior facial hair\nmade the di\ufb00erence \u2013 prevailing by\nthree points.\nAfter emerging victorious from\nthe \ufb01rst event of the day, the whole\nof Team Imperial were fully psyched\nup for the oncoming battles. The next\ncontest of interest would be the dan-tai embu, where groups of more than\ntwo people perform various sequences together. Representing the \ufb01ne\ninstitution we call Imperial would be\nour very own magni\ufb01cent six \u2013 all of\nwhom had only started kempo a few\nweeks previously. The sextet moved\nin perfect unison with a \ufb02uidity and\npassion that belied their relative lack\nof experience. Alas, it was not to be\ntheir day as a strong City University\nline-up struggled to narrowly pip\nthem to third place despite greatly\noutranking their Imperial counter-parts.\nThe \ufb01nal contest of the day was the\neagerly anticipated randori (sparring)\ncompetition, with the club being represented by housewives\u2019 favourite\nMaksim Mijovic. Buoyed by his earlier victory in the kumi embu category,\nMaks began his \ufb01rst round bout in\nstyle, bamboozling his opponent with\na \ufb02urry of fancy footwork. Unable to\ncontain his enthusiasm, he risked disquali\ufb01cation with a \ufb02ying kick that\ndrew a warning from the judges. Undeterred, Maks put this setback behind him to prevail with a succession\nof accurate blows. His second round\nopponent was Canute of City dojo \u2013 a\nformidable opponent widely considered favourite to take the trophy. This\nmatch-up required a special perfor-mance, and Maks did not disappoint,\nbringing his patented \u2018crab foot\u2019 technique to the party. Shimmying here\nand there, Maks\u2019 launched a series of\nattacks, making a few clean contacts.\nCanute himself showed his previous\ntaekwondo experience with impeccably timed counters. The match drew\nto a close with Maks having made\nmore hits in total; it just remained to\nbe seen whether they were considered clean enough on points. A sigh\nof tension rippled through the crowd\nas it was clear that the decision was\nbeing hotly debated by the judges.\nThe verdict came in, and Maks was\ncontroversially denied progress to\nthe next round leading to no rioting\nin the stands whatsoever.\nWith that, Imperial\u2019s odyssey was\nended prematurely having earned one\ntrophy for the cabinet (read: locker)\nand the hearts of the neutrals with\nthe dojo\u2019s trademark panache. As the\ndust settled on the arena and the entire team of competitors and support\nchewed over the action they\u2019d seen.\nWith one victory claimed, and a team\nof newcomers giving seasoned veterans an almighty fright, the verdict\nwas unanimously a resounding suc-cess.\nShorinji Kempo train every\nWednesday 6-8pm in JCR and Saturday 12-2pm in Union Gym\nHaving made a fantastic start to the\nseason with two impressive wins,\nthe fixture against King\u2019s College\nLondon was eagerly anticipated, if\napproached with slight trepidation.\nIn the previous three encounters\nlast season, King\u2019s had won convincingly on all occasions which\nled to their promotion in BUCS.\nHowever, they many of their starting line-up had graduated in the\ninterim. In form, this fixture was\nset to be the first true test of how\nfar Imperial has come since gaining\nmomentum last season.\nThings did not start well for IC.\nTaking to the pitch, Kings were\nalready warmed up and firing on\nall cylinders. They kicked off the\ngame and set up camp deep in the\nIC territory for much of the first\nhalf, kicking effectively to put\nthemselves inside the 22.\nThe IC pack dominated in the\nscrum to win back some posses-sion, with hooker Lana Lee turning\nover the ball on several of Kings\u2019\nput-ins. However, the pressure was\ntoo much and a failed clearance\nkick from the IC try-line was taken\nin by the Kings forwards.\nFrom 0-5 down, kicking let IC\ndown again. At the restart, the\nball was caught by the opposition\n10 who evaded several tackles and\nshowed her pace to cross the try\nline. The conversion was simple\nand IC found themselves 0-12 be-hind.\nThe half was drawing to a close\nbut not before IC could respond\nwith a try of their own. After the\npack drove King\u2019s off their scrum\nagain, substitute Caitlin \u2018Red\u2019 Jackson made an immediate impact,\npicking up the ball from number 8.\nHanding off three players, Red then\noff-loaded to scrum half Kath Fok\nwho ran a tight supporting line and\nwas put through in space behind\nthe King\u2019s defense. Sprinting to\nleave the opposition behind, Kath\nscored under the sticks and Lana\nsecured the extra points with the\nconversion.\nThe second half began with the\nscore at 7-12 and IC immediately\nturned up the heat on Kings who\nfumbled the catch from the kick.\nStrong rucking at the breakdown\nand more good scrummaging put\nKing\u2019s on the back foot. They attempted to clear their lines from\njust outside the 5m line, but the\nKing\u2019s kicker was charged down\nby the face of Kath who followed\nthe ball under the posts to score a\nsecond try in a feat of impressive\nreflexes and creativity. Another\nconversion from Lana put IC in the\nlead 14-12.\nWith the half barely underway,\nthe King\u2019s pack tried to plough their\nway back making it into the IC 22,\nbut IC were wise not to commit too\nmany players to the breakdown and\nmaintain the defensive line. Turning over the ball in the scrum, the\nbacks carried the ball away. IC were\nthen able to hold their composure,\ndespite high tensions, until the final whistle. The win against a team\nin a higher league puts the thus far\nundefeated ICUWRFC at the top\nof LUSL whilst they await BUCS\nmatches beginning at the end of\nNovember.\nUndefeated Women\u2019s Rugby top LUSL\nKath Fok Sports Writer\nA mo worthy of the\n\u2018flying moustaches\u2019!\n\n"

Majestic palms, whose leaves softly wave in a\nlight breeze, cast their shadows on white\nbeaches touched by turquoise waters.\nThis is what you seek when you go\nsur\ufb01ng. This is not what you are going to\n\ufb01nd when you go sur\ufb01ng in the UK.\nInstead you\u2019ll \ufb01nd freezing waters,\ngreyed by overshadowing clouds that\nblock any ray of sunshine. Heavy rain\nthat hits you sideways, sharpened by the\nstrong cold winds. Icebergs that \ufb02oats inexorably in the distance.\nOkay, the Icebergs part isn\u2019t true. And\nit wasn\u2019t actually that bad. But it was with\nthose premises that, Friday 3rd November, 45 people from SurfSoc left from the\nUnion, heading down to Newquay, for\nthe \ufb01rst surf trip of the season. Some of\nthem had already experienced the harsh\nconditions of the Cornish coast, but\nmost of them were beginners and had no\nidea what awaited them.\nAfter a seven hour bus ride, a surf\nmovie, jokes and stories about past trips,\nwe \ufb01nally arrived in the surf capital of the\nUK. Too late to go sur\ufb01ng, we dropped\no\ufb00 our stu\ufb00 in the rooms (nearly all of\nthem were taken by us) and begun the\nclubs\u2019 second favourite activity: drink-Surfing with the penguins\ning. Forgetting momentarily about our\n8am alarm set for the morning after, we\ninvaded the hostel\u2019s bar.\nHalf sleepy, half hung-over, we were\nawoken by the sound of waves and the\nsour promise of a watery co\ufb00ee. In the\nsame bar from the night before, we ate\nour cereals and toast staring out of the\nbig windows, looking at the bay below\nus. The cold, blue waters already hosted\nsome intrepid surfers. The conditions\nlooked better than expected from that\naltitude and we were not disappointed\nonce in the sea.\nWith an average of four feet, and some\nsets almost head height, the waves, even\nif not perfect, were more than enough\nto have fun. The sun, breaking through\nthe clouds from time to time, provided\na more than welcome psychological\ncomfort. It was only after two and a half\nhours, when hail the size of almonds replaced rain, that most people decided\nthey had enough for the morning.\nBut the day was still long. After a\nquick lunch, the ones that still had some\nstrength left in their bodies were in for\nanother session. The most experienced\nsurfers headed to Fistral Beach, hoping\nthat its greater exposure to the swells\nfrom the Atlantic would result in bigger waves. Though the strong winds had\ntransformed the unsheltered bay into a\ngiant open sky washing machine, their\ne\ufb00orts were rewarded with larger waves.\nSunset at \ufb01ve put an end to sur\ufb01ng for\nthe day. Once more, it was time to drink.\nAfter initiations for the new comers (the\ndistasteful details of which we will not\nmention here), everyone put on their\nfancy dress, mandatory for each mem-ber. And so, once again we invaded the\nbar. A few costumes in particular stood\nout. A drunk Irish penguin (J. McGuckin), a onesy tiger suit (S. Gutierrez) and a\nbad Bruno impression (A. Harvey).\nThe morning after we awoke with\nheadaches, heavy eyes and, in keeping\nwith SurfSoc pranking tradition, one of\nthe rooms covered with sand, from their\nbed sheets to the inside of their shoes.\nHowever there was no time for com-plaining. After packing the few things\nwe had, we headed down for one last\nsession.\nOur su\ufb00ering was rewarded and our\nhangover alleviated not only by bigger\nand more energetic waves, but also by\na massive rainbow whose ends touched\nthe entrance of the bay, creating a gigantic gate in the middle of the sky.\nBut time \ufb02ies when you have fun and\nthreehourslateritwasalreadytimetogo\nback home. The bus fell silent after a few\nminutes, while people tried to \ufb01nd their\nlost sleep.\nIn the following days, the most common question from my non-surfer\nfriends was: why? Why face waves that\nhit you like buckets of freezing water,\ncold winds that slap your face penetrating your bones, icy streams which \ufb02ow\nbetween your skin and your oversized\nrented wetsuit? Why do you face all that\nfor a few seconds ride? I have tried to explain that it\u2019s that few seconds ride, that\nmoment in which all your problems, all\nyour worries slide away and it\u2019s only you,\nthe sea, the speed and the adrenaline,\nthat makes it all worth it. And it makes\nyou want more. But it\u2019s pointless. The\nonly way to understand it is to experience it.\nLuca De Benedetti SurfSoc\n\n"

    "content": "TELEVISION\nTelevision Editor: Lucia Podhorska\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\n\u201cShamazeballs?\u201d\nLucia Podhorska thinks it was more of a shambles\nith it being\n\u2018Guilty Pleasures\u2019 week on\nThe X-Factor, I\nthought it oddly\nfitting to finally share my thoughts\non the current season of one of the\nworld\u2019s most famous \u2018talent\u2019 shows.\nThe X-Factor was created by Simon Cowell and began its run on\nITV back in 2004. The show has five\nstages: after initial Producers\u2019 auditions that take place months before\nthe broadcast shows, acts perform in\nfront of four judges, as well as a live\naudience. In order to advance to the\nnext round, called Bootcamp, the\nsingers must receive at least 3 \u2018yes\u2019\nvotes from the judges. During Bootcamp, the number of contestants is\nnarrowed down to the judges\u2019 Top\n24. These hopefuls are split into four\ncategories \u2013 Boys, Girls, Groups and\nThe Over 28s \u2013 with each judge being chosen to mentor one category.\nAt the Judges\u2019 Houses stage, each\njudge eliminates a further three\nacts. There are therefore 12 acts\nthat perform in the Live Shows. This\nseason finds Gary Barlow (leading\nman from Take That) mentoring\nThe Over 28s, Nicole Scherzinger\n(need I tell you who she is?) mentoring the Boys, Tulisa Contostavlos\n(member of N-Dubz) mentoring the\nGirls and Louis Walsh (manager of\nBoyzone and Westlife) mentoring\nGroups.\nRight, with all that out of the way,\nlet\u2019s discuss what is expected of the\n12 finalists in the Live Shows. It\u2019s\nvery simple, really: each act sings\none song, with each week having a\ndifferent theme, ranging from Love\nand Heartbreak to Best of British.\nAfter each performance, the judges\nare meant to give their opinion on\nthe act, potentially even be useful\nand give them some advice on how\nto improve. Unfortunately, this part\nof the show very often deteriorates\ninto heated arguments between\njudges, with attitude and insults flying around like frisbees, and no real\nconstructive criticism being offered.\nAt the end of the show, all of the\ncontestants sing together and then\nit\u2019s over to the people at home to\nsend in their votes. The results are\nrevealed on Sunday night, at which\npoint the two acts with the least\nvotes sing for their survival. The\njudges must choose who to send\nhome and in the case of a tie, it\u2019s the\nnumber of audience votes that determines the singers\u2019 fate.\nI missed the auditions this season\nand only really tuned in once the\nacts made it through to Bootcamp.\nI picked my personal favourites\nquickly and was hesitantly optimistic about the quality of the acts that\nwould compete in the finals, as it\nseemed that the judges were finally\npicking real singers, not just pretty\nfaces. Here is a breakdown of the\ncontestants still in the running:\nThe Boys\nIt was touch and go for Jahmene\nDouglas in the beginning. There is\nno denying this boy has singing talent in spades, I would even venture\nto say he has the best vocal range I\nhave heard from a male contestant\non the show, but his nerves almost\nprevented him from competing. He\nhas thankfully overcome these pre-show jitters and continues to wow\nme every week.\nJames Arthur isn\u2019t a favourite of\nmine, but I can see his appeal. He has\na distinct and unique style and there\nis so much raw emotion in some of\nhis performances that it came as a\nshock to find him in the bottom two\nthis week \u2013 but more on that later.\nI honestly thought that Rylan\u2019s\npresence in Nicole\u2019s house was a\njoke\u2026 apparently not, as he\u2019s still\naround acting like the world\u2019s biggest diva and not adding much to the\nshow apart from flashing lights and\nclub tunes.\nThe Girls\nWell, technically, as this goes to\nprint, there are no longer any acts\ncompeting from this category. That\nbeing said, I will still talk about them,\nbecause two of the girls have been\nmy favourites throughout.\nLet\u2019s start with Lucy Spraggan. She\nauditioned with an original song entitled \u201cLast Night\u201d, which was amusing but it wasn\u2019t until she sang another original song \u2013 \u201cTea and Toast\u201d\n\u2013 during Bootcamp that I became a\nreal fan. Was she the best singer on\nthe show? No, but she has real talent\nwhen it comes to writing lyrics and I\nhope her short stint on X-Factor was\nenough to open some doors for her.\nI still can\u2019t listen to \u201cTea and Toast\u201d\nwithout tearing up\u2026\nThis week\u2019s elimination of Ella\nHenderson has left me reeling. She\u2019s\nonly 16 years old but, together with\nJahmene Douglas, she had the best\nvoice this season. Her rendition of\nCher\u2019s \u201cBelieve\u201d is nothing short of\ngenius and if you don\u2019t believe me, I\nurge you to watch the video on YouW\nThe audience obviously\ndidn\u2019t \u2018Believe\u2019 in Ella\nMy Top 5 Episodes of the Week\n1. 2 Broke Girls, Season 2 Episode 7, \u201cAnd the Three Boys with Wood\u201d\n2. The Big Bang Theory, Season 6 Episode 8, \u201cThe 43 Peculiarity\u201d\n3. The Good Wife, Season 4 Episode 8, \u201cHere Comes the Judge\u201d\n4. Two and a Half Men, Season 10 Episode 8, \u201cSomething My Gynecologist Said\u201d\n5. New Girl, Season 2 Episode 8, \u201cParents\u201d\nTube and \ufb01nd new meaning in the\nsong. She has been likened to Adele\nand described as the best singer on\nthe show since Leona Lewis. She was\na true class act, one that didn\u2019t need\nany gimmicks to make her performances special and memorable.\nThe Groups\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t much care for\nthis category, so this part will be\nshort. There\u2019s only one act left anyway \u2013 boy group Union J. As much as\nit pains me to say it, they\u2019re not bad,\nbut do we really need another band\nlike The Wanted and One Direction? How about rewarding originality for a change?\nThe Over 28s\nDid you know that there has only\nbeen one winner from this category and that was all the way back in\n2004? Why is that? This year\u2019s contestants have been good but apart\nfrom Christopher Maloney, they\u2019ve\nall been voted off and I have a feeling Christopher won\u2019t last much\nlonger. It\u2019s not that he can\u2019t sing,\nbut he\u2019s quite cheesy and there has\nbeen a lot of controversy surrounding him.\nThis Week\nAs you may have gathered, James Arthur and Ella Henderson were in the\nbottom two. I wish I could be mad at\nthe judges for not unanimously saving Ella, but in this situation it was\nreally tight as Ella\u2019s performance\nfrom the Live Show was in my opinion better, but James was absolutely\namazing as he sung for survival. Either way, neither of them should\nhave been in the bottom two in the\n\ufb01rst place and this is what frustrates\nme about shows like this. This is\nmeant to be a SINGING competition\nso I wish the audience would just\nvote for the acts with the best ABILITY TO SING, and not the guy who\nneeds 20 scantily clad dancers on\nstage to distract from the fact that he\ncan\u2019t do much more than grind along\nto the music. Am I the only one who\nthinks this? Maybe not, as X-Factor\nmanaged to lose yet again to Strictly\nCome Dancing in the viewers\u2019 ratings last week.\nIt is my strong belief that the world\nneeds more singers like Adele, Leona\nLewis and Robbie Williams (before\nhis stint in rehab) who can not only\nsing, but whose songs resonate with\nan audience that is not solely composed of teenage girls, because ulti-mately, those are the singers that will\nbe remembered.\nNathalie Skrzypek Writer\n\n"

TheImperialdefencethen\nkept it tight for the next two innings, as\npitcher Hajime Urata didn\u2019t give up a\nsingle hit. Imperial tacked on another\nrun in the third, putting us 3-2 up going\ninto the fourth inning. After a pitching\nchange by Imperial, UCL grabbed two\nruns to take the lead with no outs, but\nImperial\u2019s \ufb01elders recovered the situation to keep UCL\u2019s lead to a minimum\nafter three and a half innings.\nHistory was made in the bottom of\nthe fourth innings as right \ufb01elder Chris\nCarter became the \ufb01rst player at the\nclub to be hit in the head by a pitch. All\nwere relieved that the batting helmets\nactually work, and even more so when\nDan got another base hit, leaving us\nwith two runners on base. A neat delayed steal tied the game up, and Dan\ncame home on a ground-out to put\nImperial in the lead. UCL now had to\nscore to make Imperial bat again.\nSidney, now our closing pitcher,\nstruck out the \ufb01rst two batters meaning\nthe Falcons needed only one out to end\nthe game. UCL\u2019s next batter got on base\nwith a walk, then rounded the bases,\nonly to be caught trying to steal home\nby catcher Marcel Ngan for the \ufb01nal\nout, completing a 5-4 win for Imperial.\nThe Falcons opened the batting in\nthe second game and were unlucky to\nend the \ufb01rst innings with three runners stranded on base, after hits by\nKevin and Rory Thomas. Imperial then\nscored early in the second innings, followed by a monumental home run by\nSidney in the third. The Falcons\u2019 defence held \ufb01rm, helped in no small way\nby the performance of \u201cdemon pitcher\u201d\nVincent Li (according to the UCL cap-tain).\nAfter the top of the third innings, the\ngame was appropriately called o\ufb00 for\nbad light, with UCL graciously accepting a 2-0 defeat. The opposition held\ntheir own, despite being inexperienced\nas a club, and both teams will have\nlearnt from these games. Imperial\u2019s\nperformance was very promising, and\nThe Imperial Falcons are back to winning ways after club President Dan\nHarris went 3 for 3 and Sidney Louzon\nhit a home run to \ufb01re Imperial to two\nvictories against UCL.\nFollowing on from defeats against\nULJS and a minor identity crisis after\nFelix thought we were the basketball\nteam, the Falcons were back at their\nnest in Harlington for a double header\nagainst UCL. The Imperial supporters were out in force (there were three\nhorses in the next \ufb01eld this time) for the\nFalcons\u2019 \ufb01rst home game of the season.\nThe \ufb01rst game began with both teams\nwe hope to build on these victories as\nwe begin our league campaign against\nOxford this week in the coming weeks.\nChris Carter Baseball Vice-President\nMmmmm mustard trousers\n\n"

Many\nwomen I know are afraid to walk\nalone in the dark, due to a perceived\nhigh danger of facing violence.\nThis is not a wholly surprising\nstate of affairs when adverts everywhere remind women to drink responsibly and to take care to avoid\ndanger, and when we live in a country where 1 in 4 women are raped\nin their lifetimes. I know too many\npeople who have been raped, and\nthose are just the ones that have\ntold me about it.\nThe NUS (National Union of\nStudents) performed a study of\nstudents and their experiences of\nsexual assault and violence \u2013 7% of\nstudents experienced serious sexual\nassault at university, and more than\n25% had been sexually assaulted at\nuniversity.\nIt was perhaps the other findings\nof the survey that were more shock-ing, the vast majority of perpetrators of violence against women\nwere known to their victim, and the\nacts of violence happened in their\nown homes.\nOnly 10% of the serious sexual assaults were reported to the police,\nwhich is the same reporting rate\nfrom any sector of society, and this\ndoesn\u2019t even begin to take into account how many of these reports\nbecome convictions. 43% of the victims of serious sexual assault in the\nNUS study had never told anyone\nabout their experience.\nThe lack of reporting is attributed\nto a feeling of shame, and fear of being told that it is their fault. To be\nclear \u2013 rape is the fault of the rapist,\nnot the victim.\nWhatever the victim was wearing,\nor their sexual history, the blame\nshould never be attributed to them.\nThe study from the NUS also\nlooked at the wider culture that students live in.\nNearly 70% of their respondents\nreported that they had received\nunwanted sexual attention at university from catcalling and inappropriate questions about sexuality\nand relationships, to more serious\nsexual violence.\nOverwhelmingly (though not\nexclusively) the victims of sexual\nviolence are women, and the perpetrators are men. It is often easy to\nsay that women should take care to\navoid being raped, because women\nget raped. It is perhaps more pertinent to tell men that some men\nrape, and that they should take action to stop this happening.\nOne action that comes from this\ndire state of affairs is the Reclaim the\nNight movement. Women standing\ntogether to re-assert their right to\nwalk safely at night and their right\nnot to be subjected to violence or to\nbe blamed for any that is perpetrated against them. Reclaim the Night\nis a night-time march that happens\nevery year in London and in other\ncities across the UK and the world,\nwhere thousands of women come\ntogether and shout in opposition to\nviolence against women.\nJoining a demonstration is a very\npowerful action \u2013 it might not\nchange a law, or wave a magic wand,\nbut standing up for what you believe\nin has a positive effect. Thousands\nof women marching past a group\nof people out in central London on\na Saturday evening chanting, \u201cyes\nmeans yes, and no means no\u201d, has\nthe potential to make them remember about consent or consider the\nconsequences of their actions.\nAll of this may be a too idealistic\nview of the positive effects of joining a march such as Reclaim the\nNight, but not to forget the impact\non those taking part \u2013 it is somewhat empowering to know that sexual violence is not the victim\u2019s fault,\nand that there are so many others\nwith you standing up for your right\nto be safe from rape and other vio-lence.\nThe culture of rape in the UK cannot be ignored, and protests, such\nas Reclaim the Night, are one way\nto make sure the problem is not for-gotten.\nIf you wish to join the march with\nothers from Imperial, meet on Embankment Place (near Embankment\nunderground) at 6pm on Saturday\n24th November.\nW\n\u201c\n\n"

Their set\nopened with \u2018If You Want Me To\u2019 and\nafter a choppy start, mostly due to the\nsound technician\u2019s epic struggle to sort\nout microphone levels, the band went on\nto perform a myriad of enjoyable tunes;\nsurprising, as I was under the impression\nthat Adam and Binki\u2019s \ufb01rst album was\ntoo much of a work in progress to have\nbuilt up such an appreciable repertoire.\nBinki Shapiro, if you\u2019ve never really\nheard of her before, used to be a member\nof super cool Brazilian/American band\nLittle Joy along with Rodrigo Amarate\nand Fabrizio Moretti from The Strokes.\nGreen, on the other hand, is well known\nfor his involvement in the anti-folk music\nmovementservingashalfofabandcalled\nTheMoldyPeaches. Green has also performed as a solo artist, \ufb01nding a considerable amount of success in Germany as\nwell as the US where he met Shapiro who\ncolourfully describes the two of them as\nhaving \u201c\ufb02oated into each other\u2019s circles\u201d\n.\nRegardless of knowing how they met,\nyou could tell Binki and Adam had a natural bond; they complemented each other really well. Surprisingly, Adam Green\nseemed to have kept his usual abstract\nlyrical mutterings under the hood, the\nsongs were comfortably accessible and,\nnot to mention, exceptionally charming -a true testament to the combined talent\nof the band. In general, the performance\nwas warmly received.\n\u2018Just To Make Me Feel Good\u2019 was a\nbeautifully chiming duet and \u2018Collage\u2019\n, a\ncommendable tribute to James Gang\u2019s\nsong from the late 60s, was a special song\nandoneofmyfavourites.Thebandmade\nthe song a truly unique mix of their own\nwith bursts of brass heralding an exciting instrumental with psychedelic undertones as the song came to its climax.\nI should say that the drummer made a\nmassive contribution to the build-up of\nthe song by emanating an electrifying\nenergy of such magnitude that it was\nfelt by the entire crowd of \u201cwarm bodies\u201d gathered there. This warm bodied\ncrowd was then treated to an acoustic set\ncloser, \u2018Getting Led\u2019\n, a melancholy number performed with such conviction that\nit soared over the dimly lit hall.\nI should say that the initial problems\nstarting o\ufb00 never really detracted from\nthe overall rich and heart-warming per-formance. The band truly found their\nstride with a charming and pleasant\nsound that never gave the impression of\ntrying too hard.\n\u2018Here I Am\u2019 is available to download for\nfree at adamandbinki.com. The planned\nrelease of the album is on January 29,\n2013 and I am sure it is going to be a\nbloody good album.\nRoloTomassigiveXOYOafright\nOn a chilly Halloween night, it was a\ngreat idea to warm our bodies with\na pumped up punk show at XOYO\ncourtesy of Rolo Tomassi. Dressed as\nthe Addams family, with the spritely\nlead singer, Eva Spence, appearing as\nMorticia, the band kicks o\ufb00 the night\nwith \u2018Howl\u2019.\nFrom the get-go the crowd were a\nblur of \ufb02ying limbs and a stream of\nwitches hats and unravelling mummy\ncostumes. The band were really grate-full for the crowds exuberant response\nto new tracks from the latest album\nAstrea. Normally I am not a fan of\nthis grindcore type genre but when\nyou are int the middle of the crowd\ngetting pummelled from both sides\nby crashing synths and sweating bod-ies, it is easy to understand the reason\nfor the movement\u2019s faithful following.\nThe band is tighter than ever with \u2018I\nLove Turbulence\u2019 , \u2018Pill Fox, and \u2018Old\nmystries\u2019 particularly impressive. After an 18 month touring absence it\nwas great to see Rolo Tomassi back in\naction and something more mature\nthan ever. I could hear some dickhead\nmetalheads behind me complaining\nabout the stage layout but these gripes\nwere small compared to the noise and\nfun the band brought.\nIt is quite hard to de\ufb01ne the music\nwhich Rolo Tomassi make - is it math-core, post hard-core or jazz metal? As\nan Imperial square I like boundaries\nand so music so experimental and\nbeautifully unpredictable is actually\nquite unnerving. This should not put\nanyone o\ufb00, however, because sometimes it is great to immerse yourself in\nsomething so bold yet disconcerting.\nI am still quite a way from growing\nmy hair long and buying a Metallica\nhoody [Sorry- I love stereotypes, which\nare normally quite true for musical\ntribes] but the night was far better\nthan expected. XOYO was an enjoyable venue and, although some of the\nMark England Music Editor\nMo Mirza finds a treat at Bush Hall\nissues people have with the sound\nquality became apparent during the\nnight, I would de\ufb01nitely swing by this\ntrendy hangout again. One thing is for\nsure, Halloween will not be so crazy\nnext year!\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\n6 FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\nGeorge Barnett Reporter\nStudent protest march held\nLast Wednesday, 21 November 2012,\nsaw thousands of students marching\nthrough the streets of London to\nprotest the rising cost of education.\nDubbed \u201cDemo 2012\u201d, the demon-stration, arranged by the National\nUnion of Students (NUS)expect-ed to have 10,000 attendees. The\ndemonstration by the NUS passed\nthrough central London from the\nEmbankment before heading south\nof the river at Westminster. Police\nrefused to make an estimate of the\ncrowd. However, it was estimated\nthat between 3,000 and 4,000 were\ninvolved. Bad weather was cited as a\nreason for the lower than 10,000 at-tendance. This is still a much lower\nfigure than the 50,000 strong crowd\nof two years ago when the protests\noccured over raising Tution Fees.\nLiam Burns, NUS President, said\nthat \u201ceducation should open doors,\nbut the government is slamming\nthem shut,\u201d He went on to say that\n\u201cthe damaging effects of recent\nchanges to education have restricted\naccess for future students and created new barriers for those currently\nstudying,\u201d\nWith current 1st years now paying up to \u00a39,000 per year for Tuition Fees, the aim of the protest was\nlargely to put education back on the\npolitical agenda, highlighting issues\nsuch as the impact caused by the\nnew higher fees and reduced financial support. The lack of job opportunities for young people was also\nhighlighted.\nThe mood on Wednesday was\ngenerally calm, with the Metropolitan Police reportedly only needing\nto quash one small riot. Their socalled \u201ctotal policing\u201d ensured that\nno other riots got under way during\nthe march. However, the internal\nmood of the NUS could not be said\nto be quite so calm with many rally-goers feeling betrayed by the NUS\nand their President Liam Burns for\nnot managing to stop the initial rise\nof fees.\nA final rally in Kennington Park\nsaw Burns heckled and pelted with\neggs by the thinning crowd as he\nmade his speech. Shortly after, his\nstage was invaded by some of the\naforementioned disgruntled stu-dents.

    "content": "Hackers Unite!\nSam Wong introduces Imperial\u2019s very own Hackathon\nackathons are magical.\nHackathons are non-compulsory, unpaid,\nbut last long enough to\nwarrant overtime pay\nand a day o\ufb00 in a normal corporate\nenvironment. Yet somehow participants are highly engaged, and manage to produce creative solutions in\na much tighter timeframe. Why do\nHackathons work? What is the di\ufb00erentiating factor from regular work?\nThe \ufb01rst one is focus. Online entrepreneur and author Jason Fried is\nvery vocal on this matter. He believes\nwork is like sleep. One doesn\u2019t simply\ngo to sleep, one builds towards sleep.\nThe same applies to work: it takes time\nto internalise the problem before one\ncan o\ufb00er an elegant solution. Yet, in\na normal day of work, water cooler\ngossip, meetings, and managers constantly distract workers; similar to\nhow REM sleep cannot occur with\nconstant interruptions, quality work\ncannot be achieved in most ordinary\nworkplaces.\nThe second factor is motivation. Dan\nPink, bestselling author, gave a great\nTED talk on \u201cThe Puzzle of Motivation\u201d. To motivate one to produce quality creative work, \u2018Autonomy, Mastery\nand Purpose\u2019 beats the \u2018Carrots and\nSticks\u2019 approach hands down. This\nproposition is backed by the Glucksberg\u2019s research on \u201cDuncker\u2019s Candle\nProblem\u201d. In this study, researchers\nfound that incentives only improve\nperformance in straightforward tasks.\nWhen it comes to tasks that require\ncreativity, participants that received\nmonetary incentives based on performance actually performed worse than\nthe control group who received no\nprize! Another study from the Federal\nReserve Bank reported that for tasks\nthat called for \u2018rudimentary cognitive\nskill\u2019, a larger reward \u201cled to poorer\nperformance\u201d. Dan makes the case\nthat \u2018Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose\u2019,\ni.e. to direct one\u2019s own life, to get better at something that matters, and to\ndo something in the service of something larger than oneself, are the true\nmotivators to creative tasks.\nThe third di\ufb00erentiating factor is\nthat a Hackathon kills procrastination.\nWe all know the coursework takes an\nhour to \ufb01nish if we start one hour before the deadline. Without the Hackathon, you can create an idea anytime\nbetween now and forever. However,\nin a Hackathon time is of the essence.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t join/\ufb01nish the Hackathon, I\nwill need to do the same task but lose\nthe prizes plus swags plus the job offer\u201d.\nHackathons and similar autonomous work time has proven to be a\ngreat innovation catalyst. It has produced a whole array of new products,\nmost famously Google\u2019s GMail, Google News and Facebook\u2019s like button\nand timeline.\nNow back at Imperial, what will\ndi\ufb00erentiate us from the rest of the\nworld? What makes Imperial great?\nHow can we make Imperial better?\nI believe Imperial will bene\ufb01t from\nthe same process as major tech \ufb01rms\nhave. Therefore, our best hackers are\nbeing gathered to build something\nthat works and wows over one week-end.\nLast year, the Hackathon at Imperial produced some very interesting\nproducts. Heatnote, a new slideshow\nplayer, allows students to tag confusing parts of the slide live. Lecturer\ncan thus see in real time which part\nof the slide requires further clari\ufb01cation. Another winning team created a\nsystem that automatically delivers relevant notes to your devices, based on\nyour course and location. As you can\nsee, our hackers have already implemented some great ideas.\nFor hackers who attended last years\u2019\nevent, you know how great that was.\nOur \ufb01rst ever Hackathon last year\nreceived rave reviews from Facebook\nengineers, both on quality and origi-nality. Therefore it is no surprise that\nFacebook will be mentoring the teams\nand scouting for talent in the event.\nThis year we are happy to have more\nheavyweight partners. We are pleased\nto have Microsoft engineers joining us\nin the Hackathon, who will be providing mentors and judges, and Oxford\nInstruments, who will be providing\nRaspberry Pis for the event. Now we\ntruly have broadened the horizon of\npossibilities!\nJust as any other Hackathons, we\nwill have enough food and snacks to\nkeep everyone going over the week-end. On top of that, we have organised\na few workshops to get you ready. We\nwill have workshops on Git, Mobile\nDevelopment, Facebook APIs and\nRaspberry Pis.

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26 FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\nSexism is everywhere: it\u2019s about time we grew up and realised this\nAngry Geek\nSexism and science\nam a white male, born in the\nUK, and therefore I know\nas much about being op-pressed, excluded or prejudiced against as David Cameron knows about struggling to make\nrent. There are, though, some things I\nfeel I can say about sexism at Imperial,\nparticularly in light of some recent Felix Comment articles.\nThe idea proposed last week by Ms.\nSkett that whining, complaining or\nbeing o\ufb00ended is weak and plays into\nthe hands of a sexist culture, is prob-lematic. Women are people. That\u2019s the\ngeneral idea here, right? And people,\nas we all know, are a mixed bunch.\nSome are fairly extroverted and selfcon\ufb01dent, while other people are shy\nand \ufb01nd it hard to stand their ground.\nWe come up with ideas like human\nrights, or equality acts, not simply\nbecause there are rotten cultures out\nthere. It\u2019s because they help defend\nthe very large proportion of any population who aren\u2019t good at defending\nthemselves. Not everyone can stand\nand \ufb01ght in the face of this sort of\ntreatment. I know I couldn\u2019t. The presence of a feminist society is encourag-ing, not least because it makes it clear\nthat the problem exists and that there\nare people who perhaps can be sought\nout if students feel uncomfortable\nbringing their issues anywhere else.\nImperial has a very real undercurrent of sexism running through it.\nThis operates both at the level of stu-dents, where male-dominated departments often ostracise female students,\nright through to the level of academics\nand administrators.\nThere are studies that show that sci-entists, the people who are stereotypically rational, will easily pick a student\nwho is male over a student who is\nfemale, when shown identical application forms. Even female scientists\ndemonstrate this tendency. Sexism is\na problem at any institution, then, but\nparticularly at Imperial which caters\nto subjects where a serious imbalance\nI\nalready exists before UCAS even get\ninvolved.\nThe article went on to say that only\na minority are responsible for \u2018true\u2019\nsexism, while the rest are just unfortunately swept up in the culture, like\ntiny prejudiced turds whirling around\na big sexist toilet. There\u2019s a di\ufb00erence,\nthough, between unintentional sexism\nfrom misconceptions, and 24% of male\nstudents responding to Felix\u2019s survey\nagreeing that female students have\nan advantage at Imperial. A quarter\nof men said that. I am almost certain\nthat this logic is based on the idea that\nfemale students are somehow masters\nof seduction and enchantment, thereby enabling them to succeed through\ncopying the work o\ufb00 helpless male\nstudents, or getting preferential treatment from equally helpless male sta\ufb00\nmembers. Things like this are not just\nwarning signs that sexism and gender\nimbalance is misunderstood by large\nportions of the student population \u2013\nthey are themselves acts of sexism.\nA quarter of men think that women\ncouldn\u2019t possibly be as good as they\nseem to be, and must be getting some\nkind of hidden advantage that men are\nstopped from obtaining. This is ludi-crous, and belittling, and the tiniest,\ntiniest example of the problems Imperial faces.\nWe are missing out. We are missing\nout as a university, as a global population of scientists and engineers, by\ndiscouraging female applications,\ndissuading women from staying with\nscience as a long-term career, and\nproducing an environment that is at\nthe very least uninviting, when it isn\u2019t\nbeing outright hostile. The problem\ndoesn\u2019t start and end with Imperial, it\u2019s\ntrue. We don\u2019t do enough as a society\nto present science, technology or engineering as equal-opportunity disci-plines, right from the start of a child\u2019s\nlife. But we can help push against this\nproblem from the top-down, by making the \ufb01nest institution of its kind in\nthe UK an example of equality. And it\nall starts with admitting that we have\na problem.\nSend in your argument for why there\nshould be an International Men\u2019s Day\nto the nearest waste paper bin, and all\nother emails to anangrygeek@gmail.\ncom\nLetters\nSir,\nI can\u2019t help but notice that since the\nintroduction of the new \u201cFuel\u201d pie and\nsalad outlet, the number of pies which\ncontain meat has been gradually re-ducing, up to the point where on some\ndays there are only cheese and mushroom varieties. Now you can call me\nold-fashioned, but who wants a pie\nthat just contains cheese? I recognise\nthat some people are vegetarian, but\nserving up only these when the carnivorous majority would much prefer\na classic Steak and Ale.\nSurely this must be some kind of cost-cutting measure - the wholesale price\nfor a cheese pie must be lower than\nthat of one containing meat, yet both\nof them are sold for the same price.\nHow about College stop paying someone to make sure we don\u2019t take too\nmuch mashed potato?\nAnonymous, via website\nAny sexism in there?\nDear Sir,\nI recently purchased a pasta salad\nfrom the Library Cafe and noted the\nextortionate price I paid. There was\nbarely any mozzarella in it! Waitrose do an in\ufb01nitely better feta pasta\nsalad that is a whole pound cheaper.\nGranted, they do put less pasta, but\nthe quality is powers of ten higher.\nMany powers of ten. Oh so many,\nmany, powers of ten.\nBasically: more cheese please.\nA pasta salad rater\nSend articles or letters to:\ncomment.felix@imperial.\nac.uk\nC\u2019mon, you know you want to!\n\u201c\u201d\nImperial has\na very real\nundercurrent\nof sexism\nflowing\nthrough it\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\n5\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\nMiddle East protest in Kensington\nLast Thursday, High Street Kensington found itself overwhelmed with\nprotestors. At 5:30pm, crowds gathered to protest against the violence in\nthe Middle East.\nImperial students were amongst\nthese protestors, campaigning with\nmembers of the public. Protestors\ncould be found carrying signs, chanting and making speeches in front of\nthe Israeli Embassy on High Street\nKensington.\nThe main advertising for the protests was done through Facebook,\nwith events created to include the pre-planned details of the protest. Other\nstudents were told by word of mouth\nlast minute and still decided to go.\nAround 800 people turned up for the\nprotests, ranging from young Imperial\nstudents through to elderly members\nof the public. Tony Blair\u2019s sister-in-law\nLaura Booth had also been spotted at\nthe protest.\nThe demonstration featured both\npro-Israelis protestors and pro-Pales-tine protestors. There were Imperial\nstudents protesting for each side.\nImperial students have described\ntheir accounts of the protests, mentioning that the closeness of the protest made it easy for them to join in.\nSome students were said to be using\nmegaphones or microphones with\nspeakers to spur the crowds on. One\naccount describes students climbing\nonto a bus with a \ufb02ag whilst the bus\ndrove down the road.\nOne Imperial student stated that the\nstudent voice can be the most powerful of them all and that it is important\nfor today\u2019s generation to get involved\nand get their voices heard.\nThe protests were said to last till\n9pm, with some students staying on\nafterwards to help clear up the mess.\nThe police had placed barriers on\nthe street so that cars could pass\nthrough but High Street Kensington\nwas partially closed and the road towards the Israeli Embassy had been\nclosed o\ufb00. As more and more people\narrived, the police were forced to put\nup more barriers.\nIn recent weeks, the unrest in the\nMiddle East has caused a great stir in\nthe media. Activists have accused media outlets of being biased and one-sided. Articles published have been\ndeemed unreliable as sources about\nthe events in Israel and Palestine.\nThe on-going con\ufb02ict has been a\nsource of debate for many years. The\nmost recent attacks were said to have\nstarted at the end of October. Reports\nhave been made of continual attacks\nfrom both sides resulting in numerous\ncasualties from both Israel and Palestine.\nThe violence in the Middle East is\nto such an extent that people felt the\nneed to demonstrate their disapproval\nof the situation. Many were there simply to call and end to the death and\ndestruction.\nThere are more protests planned\nduring the next week with many Imperial students enthusiastic to take\npart.\nAemun Reza News Editor\nAs I passed by the protests on\nThursday on my way home from\nuniversity, I was struck by the\nsheer nature of hatred coming from the anti-Israel protest.\nThey were waving flags of the\nterrorist organisations of Hamas\nand Hezbollah and their chants\nwere not against the recent\nconflict but were calling for the\ndownfall and end of the State of\nIsrael. The Israeli counter-pro-test however, were only shouting\nslogans of peace. \u2013 Anonymous\npasser-by\nWe wish this violent exchange to\nfind a rapid decline. Few know\nthis, but there is never actual\ntrue peace in Israel/Palestine,\nthere are only moments of si-lence. I think both sides would\nrather return to this than suffer from conflict. Israeli Society\ndoes not persuades any political\nagenda. \u2013 Israeli Society\nWhile visiting the pro-Palasti-niens protest I could not ignore\nthe call \u201cFrom the river to the\nsea Palestine will be free\u201d that\nwas constantly repeated. As an\nIsraeli that grew up in the region\nI know that the river they were\nreferring to is the Jordan river\nboarding Israel and Jordan and\nthe sea is the Mediterranean Sea\non the west of Israel and Gaza.\nIn other words, the whole area\nthat is now both Israel and Palestine. This saying is problematic\nsince it is deliberately asking for\na Palestinian country in all of the\nterritory while ignoring the right\nfor an Israeli country to exist\nthere as well. I want to believe\nthat the protesters understand\nthat the only solution to this long\nconflict is having a Palestinian\ncountry existing peacefully next\nto an Israeli one, and I want to\nhope that all of the thousands of\nlocal British supporters didn\u2019t really understand what they were\ncalling for by saying those words\n\u2013 Student protestor\nI\u2019m from the Southern part of Israel, where my family lives, and\nhave been witness of the difficult\nsituation and daily life under\nmissiles attacks for the past dec-Pro-Israeli statments\nFirstly the majority of the news articles in Western media outlets often\npresent a one-sided, biased narra-tive, of the Israelis defending themselves from Hamas and Palestinian\naggressors, resulting in a distorted\nview of the Palestinians as aggressors and the Israelis as defenders.\nOne often-quoted statement by\nMalcom X reflects this situation\nquite well...\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people\nwho are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the\noppressing.\u201d\nOver time, people seem to have\nforgotten and cannot differentiate from the oppressor and the\noppressed, and from the occupier\nand the occupied. Gaza has been\nunder blockade now for numerous\nyears. The Palestinians have been\noccupiedfordecades.Whenwillthe\nworld recognize their right to resist\nand defend themselves.\nAcloserlookatcurrenteventsalso\ndemonstrates that Israel initiated\nthis current escalation, bringing into\nquestion their true motives. \u2013 Palestinian Society\nI\u2019vegrownuplivingthePalestinian\ncrisis.

The wiki has this to\nsay: kitesur\ufb01ng or kiteboarding is an\nadventure surface water sport that\nhas been described as combining\nwakeboarding, windsur\ufb01ng, sur\ufb01ng,\nparagliding, and gymnastics into one\nextreme sport. Essentially you harness\nyourself to a giant sail and bounce\nacross the surface of the water doing\ncrazy tricks.\nRight, now that\u2019s \ufb01nished, I can tell\nyou guys about the sick weekend we\nhad. The event was in Wales. Now\nsome of you might not have been\nto Wales, but essentially it\u2019s like going back in time. Your phone gets\nno reception, GPS doesn\u2019t work and\neverything\u2019s cold. The sort of cold\nyour grandfather boasts about. But\nI digress. So we arrived on the Friday evening to register and for a few\nchilled beers. After some socialising\nwe hit the hay for an 8am start on Saturday.\nSaturday comes and we eat our bacon sarnies and head for the beach\nat 9am. The parties already rocking\nand the Beach Party Live guys already\nhave their custom \ufb01tted Land Rover\nDefender blasting out solid tune after solid tune from their hench sound\nsystem. A little bit of health and safety\nlater (because concussion is all too\neasy in this sport) \ufb01nds us down on\nthe beach and cracking out the kites.\nThe beginners immediately went o\ufb00\nand started learning the basics of \ufb02ying a kite.\nFor the pros it was time to hit the\nwater. Crushingly the wind was o\ufb00cross. Given no one wants to be blown\nout to sea few went into the water that\nday. For the rest of us we had no resort\nbut to kiteboard around the beach and\nplay \u2018super sporty board sports and\nwater sports sports day\u2019 in between.\nVolleyball and beers anyone? At one\npoint the police showed up, but our\nparty was so rocking they asked us to\nturn it up. But that\u2019s just kite life.\nLater on that night saw some awesome party. The sound system from\nthe Land Rover was now in the communal hall and the Halloween decorations were out. Given this event was\ncross uni, the ratios were excellent,\nand with the octobong (5 gallon, 8 way\nfunnel) at hand to ensure drunkenness\neveryone was getting friendly. There\nwere heros. There were casualties. But\nthat\u2019s just kite life.\nThe Sunday session started an hour\nlater (thank fuck) and found us on the\nbeach with little memory of the night\nbefore, massive hang overs and a jigsaw puzzle of photos. Given no one\nreally seemed to know entirely what\nhappened we decided it best to move\non and the beginners got back to work\nmastering their kite work.\nThankfully the wind had switched\non-cross and us pros got into the\nwater. Nothing cures a hangover like\njumping into the ocean. Especially\nwhen that jump is 3-5m into the air\nand back again, but that\u2019s just kite life.\nAll in all an excellent weekend. You\nall missed out. UNACCEPTABLE. Be\nsure not to miss our next beginners\nweekend (23-25 November) check us\nout on Facebook for more details or\nemail kitesurf@ic.ac.uk for details.\nThe beginners\u2019 weekend, as reported by Leon Vanstone\nYou don\u2019t get girls bruv.\nKitesurfing gets girls\nYep, the octobong should be the\nfocus. More importantly, why\nhas that guy from the front\njust beamed in from the 60s?\nApparently it wasn\u2019t\na nude beach. No\nwonder people\nlooked at me funnily\nwhen I went there\nA typical British\nday. So bright and\nsunny\nO\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n39\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\nWell, there are some \ufb01lms that when\nyou are a bit too pretentious, you always act as you have seen them (I am\none of the few people on this planet\nto admit that I have yet to watch The\nGodfather trilogy. And I am too pretentious for my own good). In the past\ndecade, Walter Salles\u2019 The Motorcycle\nDiaries (Spanish: Diarios de Motocicleta), came to be added in this list.\nFrom pseudo-Marxist friends to\nmy dad, everyone was looking at me\nwide-eyed when I said that I haven\u2019t\nseen this \ufb01lm (in my dad\u2019s case, he\neven knew the director\u2019s name \u2013 I\nthought his range was only Coppola\nand Scorsese. Wrong). It has always\nbeen one of those things in the back\nof my mind. I always think of watching but never actually do. Thankfully,\naround London there are some very\npretty charity shops, and one of them\nhappened to sell the DVD for a reasonably low price.\nBehind every big move, there is a\nsigni\ufb01cant reason. In this case, the\nmovie examined the reasons that ignited the desire of Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara (then without the nickname) to\nfree the lands South America. But this\nis far from a political movie. This is an\node to friendship, love, being young\nand full of life and ideas.\nWatching the film was an overall kind\nof experience. First of all, it is visually\narresting. The beautiful landscapes of\nSouth America make you stare at the\nscreen mesmerised. They are not portrayed ideally beautiful, with blasts of\ncolour here and there. On the contra-ry, they are bared to their true beauty,\nsometimes raw, sometimes softer. From\nthe dry roads to the snow-filled mountain tops, you fall in love with this continent and realise one of the reasons why\nthe future Che would go in the revolu-tion. On the other hand, the cast of the\nmovie, from the protagonists to the ex-tras, are all realistic faces, people you\nwould see in your everyday life, people\nyou\u2019d expect to live back in the day.\nPeople you can relate to and make your\nvisual trip easier and enjoyable.\nBy mentioning the cast, it is unavoidable not to refer to the great talent Gael\nGarcia Bernal is. I had a crush on him\nfor ages. It is because of his cute face for\nGenuinely interesting diaries\nthe most part, but this guy is an undeniable talent. His body oozes idealism,\nkindness and good motives. I have not\nstudied Guevara thoroughly to know\nhis moves, gestures and general way of\nmoving. But what I could certainly tell\nfrom Gael Garcia Bernal\u2019s approach is\nthat he made his character come across\nas a person that would do every single\ngesture that the character in the movie\ndid.\nThe prominent well intentioned motives of Guevara were a very good\nground for the contradiction that was\nbuilt between him and his co-traveller\nAlberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna).\nGranado comes across as a less well-intentioned man, as someone that puts\nhis survival above all. Maybe that was\nmy main problem with the movie \u2013 the\nway that Guevara\u2019s selflessness was thoroughly promoted by Granado\u2019s more\nselfish ways. I believe that sometimes\nthe whole comparison issue made the\nmovie lose bits of its charm and was too\nobvious for the average viewer, making\nGranado quite unlikeable sometimes,\neven though at the end of the day he\nproves to be a loyal friend and a good\nhuman being.\nSet aside this, the movie handles its\nthemes in an excellent way. The last act\nof the film, that take place in the leprosy\nsanatorium, reveals Ernesto as a different person, if not ready to become the\nicon he later embodies, at least be someone with a fierce desire to make people\u2019s\nlives better, sacrifice himself, because he\nhonestly loves them. He honestly wants\nto provide all support possible \u2013 from\nmedical to emotional.\nThe future Che sets an excellent example of how ideas can be incarnated and\nhow we can change the world, little by\nlittle. His adamant position and opinion\nremained stable, despite all the difficulties he may have confronted. Even when\nhe can use money for his own benefit\nDespoina Paschou Film Writer\nTwilight sucks...and not in the good way\nKaty Bettany Who??\nBreaking Dawn Part 2\nDirector: Bill Condon\nScreenwriters: Melissa Rosenberg,\nStephenie Meyer (novel)\nStarring: Robert Pattinson, Kristen\nStewart, Taylor Lautner, Michael\nSheen\nThe Twilight Saga comes to a much\nneeded close with its \ufb01nal instalment.\nThe main problem with this \ufb01lm is\nthat Meyer\u2019s \ufb01nal book barely contained enough content for one \ufb01lm,\nlet alone two franchise-bleeding ep-ics. Consequently, this \ufb01lm ended up\nbeing two hours in which essentially,\nnothing happened.\nThe \ufb01lm begins with Bella opening\nher eyes as a vampire for the \ufb01rst time,\nand soon after meeting her and new\nhusband Edward\u2019s, creepy daughter\n(ridiculously CGI enhanced, and even\nmore ridiculously named Renesmee).\nRenesmee, being only half vampire,\ngrows at least a year older in every\nscene, it seems, until she morphs into\nthe 11 year old actress Mackenzie Foy\n\u2013 who took on her on-screen mother\u2019s blank, miserable expressions as if\nshe had inherited them. Soon she is\nmistaken for an immortal child, i.e. a\nchild turned into a vampire (forbidden\nby the Volturi under punishment of\ndeath \u2013 pretty self-explanatory \u2013 imagine a toddler with bloodlust). Alice,\naided by her visions, sees that the Volturi, led by Aro (Sheen), are coming to\npunish the Cullens, who then begin\nthe task of rounding up their friends\nfrom around the world in an attempt\nto make the Volturi listen before they\nare unfairly slaughtered.\nFor creatures that supposedly can\nmove at lightning speed, the Volturi\ntake a hell of long time to show up \u2013\nwell over an hour, leaving plenty of\ntime for Stewart, Pattinson and Lautner to gaze longingly at the camera.\nThere are too many extended, self-indulgent shots of the three walking,\nor driving a car, or sitting in chairs; as\nif these inane functions are somehow\nspecial because they are performed by\nbeautiful people. More likely, Condon\nrealised he wouldn\u2019t have enough content to \ufb01ll a feature length \ufb01lm, and\nhad to pad it out in the most boring\nway imaginable. The \ufb01rst hour, there-fore, was excruciatingly slow paced\nand full of sickening happy family/\nnew house tweenage fantasy.\nStewart and Pattinson are patently too immaculate and beautifully\nturned out to be new parents, probably something to do with their parenting method, which should de\ufb01nitely\nbe converted into a book for expecting\nparents. Occasionally pose at a piano\nwith your child, then leave the di\ufb03cult parts to your undead family and a\npseudo-paedophile wolf (I\u2019ll get onto\nhim). This method leaves plenty of\ntime for gazing at each other/oneself\nlongingly and getting it on (apparently\nwhen vampires have sex they sparkle\n\u2013 who knew?). Lautner has been busy\nsince the last \ufb01lm; adding 6 extra muscles to his stomach, which de\ufb01nitely\nisn\u2019t a bad thing, as well as imprinting\n(a wolfy form of arranged marriage)\nonto Renesmee. The latter is vaguely\nunsettling, as while we are assured it is\ninvoluntary and not deviant in nature,\nit\u2019s still more than a bit creepy.\nSo \ufb01nally, the Volturi show up. Since\nseeing Sheen play Hamlet on stage last\nyear, I\u2019m always a bit sad to see him in\nthis franchise, as I think he\u2019s too good\nan actor for the role. Nonetheless he\nplays psychopathic Aro in a suitably\ntwisted and humorous fashion. The\nensuing \ufb01ght scenes between the Cullens, their friends and the Volturi were\nactually well constructed, and Ashley\nGreene (Alice) is awesomely bad-ass.\nMore time should have been spent\non the vampires the Cullens\u2019 took the\ntrouble of collecting, however, as they\nhad some pretty interesting powers,\nbut mostly just stood around looking scary. Some shock moments too,\ncausing a few screams from the au-dience, as the \ufb01lm deviates from the\nbook in an annoying twist.\nAll in all, despite a reasonable ending (the \ufb01ght scenes, not the horri\ufb01c\nvideo montage of Edward and Bella\u2019s\nlove story), this \ufb01lm felt empty and\nself indulgent, its moments of wit\ndrowned out by everything else. Diehard fans will probably revel in Edward and Bella\u2019s fantasy ending, but\neven as part of a franchise, this \ufb01lm\nis less than convincing. Ultimately,\nthe \ufb01nal book should never have been\nsplit into two.\n(or, in this case, actual needs), he prefers\nto give it to people in need. His whole\nicon and what he generally represents\nmake you root for the character, moving further from the historical figure he\ngrows to become.\nSalles\u2019 first effort away from his homeland and native language (he is Brazilian) does not seem like a too hard one.\nHe handles perfectly the landscapes\nof the rest of his home continent, and\nmakes them home to you, yet something magical you would like to discover someday.\nAnother exceptional point of the film\nis its comic undertone, that adds to its\nrealism and moves away from the self-seriousness a biopic of a figure as Che\ncould have carried. On the contrary,\nmakes the movie even more realistic\nand moves you away from the danger of\nbecoming bored to death or feeling like\nyou are taught a lesson by the movie \u2013\nyou are taught zillions of them, but you\nactually enjoy it.\nThe density and beauty of this movie\ncome gently into your soul and after its\ntwo hours elapse leave you with a feeling of satisfaction, of a spiritual nutrition that makes you want to change the\nworld; not because you want to cast\nyour mark upon humanity, but because\nyou love this goddamn world. In times\nlike these, this is one desire we should\nembrace more, one that should be born\nin ourselves and take over.\n\u2018Must act, must act, must act\u2019\nAh crap I left\nmy USB at\nhome. It had\nmy lab report\non it...\n\n"

It also\nachieves this level of greatness in a\nsub-genre that is more often than not\nplagued with its own brand of clich\u00e9s\nand predictable plot turns. But with\nEnd of Watch director David Ayer has\nmade even the most obvious, tiresome\nformula with such style and panache\nthat you will come out of the screening\nfeeling richly rewarded and your pulses\nracing. It knows when to hold o\ufb00 on the\naction, it lets its characters develop and\ninteract with one another, the dialogue\nis often sharp and witty, and when the\nmuch-anticipated ultimate shoot-out\ndoes grace the screen, it pays o\ufb00, in its\nkinetic, resounding \ufb01nale.\nIt starts o\ufb00 and does try its best to\nmaintain its consistency to look and\nsound like the \u201cfound footage\u201d type of\n\ufb01lm. We see Brian Taylor (Gyllenhaal),\na junior o\ufb03cer in the LAPD \ufb01lming his\ndaily police activities for a class he is at-tending. Whatever the excuse, the format works well as we follow the many\nlong drives he and his close friend and\npartner Mike Zavala (Pena) share during their shifts. A lot of their days consist of the two of them driving around\nin their squad car, patrolling the neighbourhood as the two best friends casually trade insults and cheeky swipes at\none another.\nGyllenhaal and Pena inhabit the roles\nas if they\u2019ve been doing this for years,\nand the \ufb01lm has done well in securing\nthese two actors and setting them up\nagainst one another. The fast-paced,\nhumourous interplay between the two\ncomes in incredibly handy as there is\nno shortage of aspects to enjoy even\nwhen there is a lack of bullets \ufb02ying\nacross the scene. But make no mistake\nin thinking they\u2019re the corrupt, arrogant cops who run wild \ufb02ashing their\npolice badges. These two, along with\nthe rest of their department, made up\nof similarly determined and serious-minded cops (both male and female),\ntake their job and duty to serve and\nprotect in the most genuine, honest\nway that they would lay down their\nlives without any hesitation.\nFurther building on their character\nbefore anything signi\ufb01cant happens is\nthe development of their other halves.\nBrian seems to be in between several women, whereas Mike has a wife.\nThings get certainly more amusing for\nMike when Brian \ufb01nds \u201cthe girl\u201d in the\nform of Janet (Kendrick). Here we are\ngiven occasional breaks that see them\nout of their uniforms, where they go\nabout the normal day-to-day lives,\ndealing with love, marriage, pregnancy,\na newborn baby etc. The two women,\nKendrick and Martinez (Mike\u2019s wife)\nprovide a welcome fresh air in the\nmidst of some of the heavier, darker\nside of the \ufb01lm and they have their own\nmoments of priceless addition to the\nmore charming side of the nicely balanced script.\nAs the two dutifully go about their\npatrols, they seize a handful of drugs,\nmoney, gold-painted weapons, and\neven free some victims of human traf\ufb01cking. And in doing so they alert the\nlocal Mexican cartel who aren\u2019t all\nthat enthusiastic about two eager cops\nmessing with their business. And so\nthe threats begin to mount, as it becomes all too clear that they are no\nlonger safe.\nEvery so often we get treated to loud,\nintense action sequences, that come\nwith plenty of bursts of energy, and,\nas they are saved up for more crucial\nscenes, their presence feels more signi\ufb01cant. This is also where the documentary style takes the backseat and\nthis allows more room for the director\nto play around with as he can capture\nthe thrilling events at various angles\nwhere Brian Taylor\u2019s recording cameras aren\u2019t necessarily there. It\u2019s slightly\ncheating of course, but the feel of the\n\u201cfound footage\u201d piece, its tight, narrow\nshots, the carefully controlled chaotic\natmosphere are all still very much pre-sent, and the slight rule-bending turns\nout to be a massive plus, especially in\nthe \ufb01lm\u2019s climax.\nThe emotionally charged \ufb01nish, the\npowerful punch in the end, comes\nthanks to the two outstanding performances and their ability to make\nus believe everything they say, do and\nstand for. This is probably as raw, real,\nand involving as a cop drama can ever\nget, and for such an elusive line of\nworkplace, we get a more than decent\ninsight into what may be involved in\nwhat these men and women in uniform get up to in order to protect their\ndistricts.\nEnd of Watch\nDirector: David Ayer\nScreenwriter: David Ayer\nStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael\nPena, Anna Kendrick, Frank Grillo,\nAmerica Ferrera, Natalie Martinez\nJohn Park Film Editor\nSilver Linings Playbook\nDirector: David O. Russell\nScreenwriters: David O. Russell,\nMatthew Quick (novel)\nStarring: Bradley Cooper, Jennifer\nLawrence, Robert De Niro, Jacki\nWeaver\nOh you...\nWhy don\u2019t you play with yourself\nFor a man just released from the mental institution, Pat (Cooper) seems to\nhave an alarmingly optimistic view\non his future well-being. He is convinced his estranged wife, who has\ntaken out a restraining order against\nhim, will come back to him and he\u2019s\nunafraid to try whatever he can to win\nher over. His strategy is to think posi-tive. Because with all the good energy\nand vibe, he believes he has a shot at a\n\u201csilver lining\u201d (hence the title).\nPat has bipolar disorder for which he\nneeds medication. When undiagnosed\nwith this condition, he had the misfortune of walking into his home to \ufb01nd\nhis wife in the shower with another\nman. He almost beat the guy to death,\nfor which he carried out a sentence of\n8 months in the aforementioned mental hospital. But armed with the motto\n\u201cExcelsior\u201d that gives him inspiration\nand a reliable recharge he needs to get\nback to his normal life, Pat is back.\nHis parents however, Pat Senior and\nDelores (De Niro and Weaver, respec-tively), aren\u2019t fully convinced that their\nson is fully in control of his situations.\nAnd just as they feared, he shows signs\nthat all may not be well.\nMental illness is a di\ufb03cult subject\nmatter to handle well, especially if it\nis the director\u2019s intention to include\nsome humour into the mix. But David\nO. Russell, although not exactly the\ngo-to guy for comedy, manages to sensitively address the issues surrounding\nhis protagonist\u2019s everyday obstacles,\nand how the condition a\ufb00ects not only\nhim but the ones around him. He allows his characters to be as outrageous\nas humanely possible, without ever\nmocking those with mental illnesses.\nThey are never rounded o\ufb00 into broad\nstereotypes of unstable, screaming\nand psychotic caricatures, but often\nwell-grounded and controlled with\nonly brief moments of outbursts that\n\ufb01t in with the scenario.\nWith the introduction of Ti\ufb00any\n(Lawrence) Pat\u2019s life becomes more\ncomplicated. As a self-proclaimed slut\n(she got \ufb01red from her job by sleeping\nwith everyone at her o\ufb03ce) mourning\nthe sudden death of her husband, she\u2019s\nunafraid to speak her mind, much\nlike Pat, and she seems to be the only\none who understands what Pat is going through and what kind of help he\ntruly needs. And in this central role\nLawrence, giving the most mature and\ngutsy performance to date, truly grabs\non to your attention and never lets\ngo. With twisted complications of her\nown to deal with, Ti\ufb00any is a tough\nnut to crack, but behind the cold eyes\nof hers there is a lonely human being\nwho longs for a true connection, a\nfriend, and someone who perhaps understands her.\nIt would appear Pat isn\u2019t the only\none in his family with problems. His\nfather, with subtle hints throughout\nthe \ufb01lm telling us that he has OCD,\nhas lost his job and has been making a living as a book-keeper betting\non football games always loyally supporting the Philadelphia Eagles. So\nhow does this little subplot \ufb01t in with\neverything going on? Pat Sr considers his son to be his own little lucky\ncharm, although Pat Jr has a hard time\naccepting such nonsense. But in a ten-der, \ufb01lm-de\ufb01ning moment we see the\nquiet yet beautifully nuanced De Niro\nopening up ever so slightly, which to\nhis character, is a huge step and he lets\nus know it.\nCaught up in the family chaos, and\narguably the only sane one who acts\nas the glue keeping everyone together\nis the family matriarch, Delores, nervously standing by to di\ufb00use whatever\nsituation may \ufb02are up. This is Australian actress Weaver\u2019s yet another\nstunning supporting turn. Here she\nhas less to do compared to the bigger\nnames, no speeches or showy mo-ments, but her warmth is just as easily\nfelt as the worried mother and wife.\nShe is so natural in exuding the love\nand devotion of a full-time housewife\nthat she in fact plays a huge part in\ncreating this loving family drama.\nAs the \ufb01lm increases the stakes\nwhen it comes to both Pat Sr\u2019s bets as\nwell as Pat Jr\u2019s blossoming relationship\nwith Ti\ufb00any through a dance competi-tion, there is a sense of forced overlap\nof sorts to make a bigger, rousing moment of victory, which marks the \ufb01lm\u2019s\nonly notable misstep. But the high it\nends on is a truly remarkable and sensational one, with the people you\u2019ve\nconstantly rooted for getting the ending they thoroughly deserve.\nSeriously, do you end up with Gale or Peeta?\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\n\ufb01lm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n36 FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\nThe Master:\nPros: A big winner at this year\u2019s Venice Film Festival, scooping up the Best Actor\nand Best Director awards, Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s latest drama loosely based\non the foundation of Scientology as well as its leader has its awards momentum\nfully going for it, as the critics cannot stop talking about the wonderful visuals,\nthe powerful storytelling, as well as its two impressive lead performances. Plus\nAnderson is known for being the most dynamic, modern Hollywood director.\nCons: It\u2019s not the most accessible \ufb01lm around, and its excessive ambiguity as\nwell as Anderson\u2019s trademark style isn\u2019t to everyone\u2019s taste. Some have called\nthis \u201copaque\u201d and its lack of wide appeal may hurt its chances, like it has for\nmany of Anderson\u2019s previous \ufb01lms.\nLincoln:\nPros: Compared to the one where Lincoln goes around killing vampires, Steven\nSpielberg\u2019s more serious adaptation will of course stand out, and with Daniel\nDay-Lewis\u2019 performance of the President already generating buzz as well as a\nhealthy dose of fascinating historical drama, this has Oscars written all over\nit. That Lincoln is surrounded by a batch of superb supporting players (Oscar-winning Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones to name a couple) also boosts its\ncredentials.\nCons: Spielberg has attracted his share of detractors over the years, with some\nnot appreciating his overuse of sap in order to sell a story. It\u2019s been more than 10\nyears since he won an Oscar, maybe the voters are trying to tell him something.\nLes Miserables:\nPros: An adaptation of the grand, big-scale musical that took the world\u2019s stage\nby storm, it\u2019s \ufb01lled with big names (Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, Amanda Seyfried), big tunes and big sets. Have you\nSEEN the trailer? Even hearing the songs \ufb01lls you with inspiration and tingling\ngoose bumps. Under the steady guidance of Tom Hooper (The King\u2019s Speech)\nthis could be another musical to absolutely sweep the board come Oscar time.\nCons: This is the \ufb01rst musical \ufb01lm where the cast sings everything live. Sure\nit may sound authentic, but these actors, some who aren\u2019t necessarily trained\nsingers, could botch the job, and there\u2019s nothing more excruciating than listening to beloved songs butchered on screen.\nLife of Pi:\nPros: \u201cBased on a best-selling novel\u201d is always a good place to start if you want\nto score something big and catch everyone\u2019s attention, and Ang Lee certainly\nhas, with his latest mystical adventure. A director with keen eyes for stunning\nvisuals, Lee seems to have held nothing back in recreating the immense fantasy\nworld of a young man on a spiritual journey after a shipwreck. Reviews from\nvarious \ufb01lm festivals have so far been positive, which bodes well for the future.\nCons: Films based on books always have that challenge of living up to the hype\nof the original book lovers. The rule that books are always better than \ufb01lms have\nonly scarcely been proven wrong, and given the large fan-base for its novel,\nLee\u2019s \ufb01lm has a lot to live up to.\nZero Dark Thirty:\nPros: Kathryn Bigelow, the \ufb01rst and so far only female director to have won a\nBest Director Oscar, follows up 2009\u2019s The Hurt Locker with another war \ufb01lm set\nin the Middle East. This time the subject matter is one that everyone will be familiar with: the hunt and eventual capture of Osama Bin Laden. With this kind\nof exciting premise, there will be tension, there will be action, and there will be\nblood, something Bigelow is more than capable of delivering in full potential.\nCons: It\u2019s rare for someone to have two consecutive hits like this. No matter\nhow well the \ufb01lm turns out to be, Bigelow and her \ufb01lm may have to sit this one\nout to give room for others. The December limited release is a good sign, but\nwill that give this enough push?\nSilver Linings Playbook:\nPros: Ever since its debut at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, this\nhas been winning awards left and right, with both the critics and audiences\nwarming up to the crowd-pleasing dramedy starring a strong ensemble of excellent actors. Jennifer Lawrence in particular has been highlighted for her gutsy\nportrayal of a struggling widow with a touch of craziness, whereas David O.\nRussell\u2019s balanced, sensible script dealing with mental illness is also attracting\npraise.\nCons: The awards race is still in the very early stages, with some heavy dramas\nbeing released later this year to perhaps subdue the hype surrounding this one.\nIt now needs to do well \ufb01nancially; otherwise this will disappear into obscurity.\nBeasts of the Southern Wild:\nPros: There is always that one or two Sundance hit that manages to squeeze in\nthe Best Picture nominations list and if there were any this year, this would be\nmore than deserving of that honour. Touching, funny, magical, intense, \ufb01rsttime director Benh Zeitlin\u2019s incredible achievement through his imaginative\nwriting that knows no bounds is one of, if not THE year\u2019s best. The world seen\nthrough the eyes of a brave six-year-old girl is a thing of wonder and beauty.\nCons: Timing is always key when it comes to playing the awards season game,\nand the fact that this has been around for months doesn\u2019t count as a positive\nthing. And not everyone was sold on the \ufb01lm\u2019s charm, criticising the \ufb01lm\u2019s lack\nof ultimate sense and structure.\nArgo:\nPros: Ben A\ufb04eck, who has reinvented himself as a serious director after two\nsuccessful features, has created a real crowd-pleasing knock-out \u2013 about how\nan insane CIA operation actually worked and saved 6 Americans from the Iranian hostage crisis. Everyone loves a bit of self-congratulation, but why this has\nreally connected with audiences is A\ufb04eck\u2019s unquestionable talent in mounting\nnail-biting tension. The most exciting movie event of the year deserves a spot.\nCons: The feel-good element is a bit of a double-edged sword \u2013 they may cheer\nduring the \ufb01lm, the box o\ufb03ce receipts may rack up, but looking back on the\n\ufb01lm, the voters might not be so kind as time goes by, as the \ufb01lm\u2019s shallow simplicity may become apparent.\nDjango Unchained:\nPros: Quentin Tarantino is back, and it looks like he\u2019s directed yet another bonk-ers, violent mayhem \u2013 something he has expert knowledge in. It features expert\nperformances from Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCpario and Christoph Waltz, who\nisn\u2019t at all unfamiliar with working with Tarantino, having scored awards glory\nwith Inglourious Basterds. This time, it\u2019s a brutal Western about a slave-turned-bounty hunter looking to rescue his wife from a ruthless plantation owner.\nCons: Tarantino is known for his uninhibited, un\ufb02inching directing style, and\nwith that can have a fair number of critics who wouldn\u2019t warm to his style. His\n\ufb01lms have never been awarded the top gong at the Oscars, and his bad luck may\ncontinue this year, as he won\u2019t change for anyone.\nAcademy\nAward\nAnticipation\nThe Oscar race is now officially on \u2013 because we say it is. Summer\u2019s over, and\nslowlybutsurely,thestudiosareangling\ntheir release dates to coincide with the\nmany voting deadlines that have been\nput in place for next year\u2019s Oscars. Felix Film wishes everyone the best of\nluck, and may the odds be ever in their\nfavour...\n(And yes, there are some shocking\nomissions from this list. Big no-nos to\nThe Dark Knight Rises, Magic Mike, Skyfall, The Hunger Games, The Best Exotic\nMarigold Hotel, among others)\nJohn Park gives the pros and cons for\neach of those that may be in the running\n\n"

This doodle is by Ioanna Kalogeraki.\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\n30\nPinero\u2019s The Magistrate is a classic\nof 19th Century farce. It concerns a\nwoman with a son from a previous\nmarriage, who has to conceal her\nreal age from a recently acquired\nhusband, the magistrate. This means\na 19 year old son, along with everyone else, are convinced he is actually\n5 years younger than he is. Through\nthat deceit, the farce brought all the\ncharacters together to a supper room\nwhere they were found contravening\nthe licensing laws by the police. The\nsubsequent fallout concerning reputation and social standing occupies\nthe last two acts with a few romantic\nstorylines thrown in for good meas-ure.\nAs Victorian farces go, it was a\npretty standard a\ufb00air. Although consistently funny, it was hardly laugh-out-loud. Considering this was only\nput on as a replacement for the cancelled The Count of Monte Cristo,\none can understand why this may\nnot have been a polished perfor-mance, but there was su\ufb03cient magic to create an energetic, colourful,\nuplifting and funny production, that\nthey managed to achieve a delightful\nresult.\nThe set design, by Katrina Lindsay,\nwas dramatic. The opening scene\nunfolded like a giant pastel coloured\npop-up book with characters magically appearing from the folded pag-es. There is the hint of a Christmas\ntree on one side of the stage to remind us this is the National\u2019s Christmas production and a little caption\nbeginning with \u2018the skeleton in the\ncloset\u2019 at the top of the \u201cpage\u201d, which\nA farce in\nthe wind\nChristopher Hong Writer comprised the \ufb01rst scene. Subtle it\nis not, but along with all the skewed\nangles of doorways and windows\nthe set design suited the caricatured\ncharacters throughout the play; from\nthe man-child son, to the gloomy\nmagistrate\u2019s assistant.\nThis caricatured theme continued\nwith a fusillade of jokes delivered\nwith a knowing nod-and-a-wink.\nScene changes were interspersed\nwith 19th century operetta-style\nnumbers which summarised the storyline with wit and small self-refer-ential details.\nThe cast was excellent, with John\nLithgow playing the magistrate; the\nhighlight a superb solo scene where\nhe recounts a chase, playing everything from the police to a horse. If\nthere was ever a master-class in one-person theatre, I would nominate\nthis scene.\nJoshua Mcguire, as the son of a\nconfused age, was superb, showing\nthe perfect balance between precociousness and prescribed childishness and the natural urges of a grown\nman.\nThe direction by Thimothy Sheader\nwas tight and kept up a pace and en-ergy. My only criticism was a slight\ndip in the middle of Act 3 but it soon\ngave way to a frantic \ufb01nal act.\nThis was theatre production at its\nvery best: bringing superb direction,\nacting and production design to-gether. There will not be many productions out there to brighten up the\ndark winter nights ahead as accomplished and satisfying as this.\nThe Magistrate at The National Theatre. Until 22nd January 2013.\nWhatcha doin?\nJust Roman\naround\nEva Rosenthal Arts Editor\nThe luminous setting, sand trickling\nfrom the ceiling onto the stage into\npools of light, was melancholy and serenity personi\ufb01ed. The existence of the\ncharacters, who would soon be participating in the tragedy, was mirrored,\nsomehow with tenderness,in the environment that had been created. It was\nan environment \ufb01t for observation and\nfor immersion, the audience entirely\nsurrounding a small stage; a single\nroom for Racine\u2019s unhappy creations.\nThe tragedy in this play is not reliant on death or treason or madness,\nexcept perhaps on the folly of love. But\nit is tragedy nonetheless and in many\nways just as brutal as any relying on\ndeath would be.\nTitus has become Emperor of Rome.\nHis love, Berenice, is an eastern Queen,\nwhom the Romans will never accept as\nwife for their new Caesar. Titus must\nask her to leave or face the coming\nwrath of the people. Their, as yet unut-tered, demand is not however, a suggestion of the cruel ignorance of the\nmasses; it is rather a darkness that will\novercome Berenice almost completely.\nAnne-Marie Du\ufb00 is moving and expressive in the title role (although she\nslouches too much for a queen) and\nher Titus, Stephen Campbell Moore,\nwith desperation in his eyes, is convincingly the unwilling tyrant to his\nown soul.\nIt must be di\ufb03cult to keep Racine\u2019s\npurity in an English translation, but\nthe language at least never disturbs.\nIf my attention was kept on the whole\nrather than on the quality of the words,\nthis was more a testament to the very\nbeautiful staging.\nI have read that the English often\n\ufb01nd Racine boring: perhaps this is\ndue to bad translations or because\nRacine\u2019s classicism is very di\ufb00erent to\nShakespeare. However in the Donmar\nWarehouse\u2019s Berenice, even the most\nembittered of audiences could hardly\nfail to be moved by the lovers, facing\nwith stoicism, an eternity of loneliness.\nUntil 24th November only!\nFancy giving me a little Caesar\nShit,shit, shit!

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\n24\nIt takes two to tango\nThe state of current libel laws is ludicrous; they must adapt to the\ndigital age, says George Butcher\nGeorge Butcher\nAre you facing charges?\nhis week the biggest libel case in legal history\nwas launched \u2013 thousands of people are\npotentially facing legal\naction and most of them are \u2018normal\npeople\u2019. Why? Because anyone who\ntweeted or re-tweeted Lord McAlpine\u2019s name in relation to child abuse\nallegations is going to get a letter\nfrom his lawyers, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you deleted it later.\nTwitter is now considered by the\ncourts to be equivalent to a printed\npublication. If I wrote defamatory\nremarks about someone there, say\nthe Rector, which I couldn\u2019t back up,\nboth myself and the editor would potentially be facing a civil law suit. Libel laws are designed to prevent reputations from being destroyed by lies\nand to protect all of us. Now, though,\nthis means that anything I tweet also\nfollows the same rules. How did this\nhappen?\nEight months ago was the \ufb01rst libel case involving Twitter. Cricketer\nChris Cairns was awarded \u00a390,000\nplus \u00a3400,000 legal expenses from\nLalit Modi, the deposed IPL com-missioner, who had tweeted he had\nbeen barred due to \u201chis past record\nin match-\ufb01xing\u201d. This allegation was\nseen by an immense crowd of followers (69 to be precise) and almost went\nviral with nearly 1100 people seeing it re-tweeted. That\u2019s \u00a381 a head.\nCairns\u2019 lawyers did what they would\nif Lalit Modi had printed his opinions\nin a paper and the judge agreed with\nthem saying that, \u201cnowadays the poi-T\nson spreads more rapidly\u201d.\nWe now have an insane situation. It\nis a ridiculous one and it is a result\nof a legal decision made by a judge\nwith no mandate to do so. Fixing libel law for the digital world is the\njob of parliament. Mr Justice Bean\nhas independently made one of the\nmost consequential legal decisions of\nrecent years. Twitter is not a publica-tion: Twitter is \ufb02eeting and informal.\nA tweet is closer to a text message or\na chat with friends, not a written declaration of one\u2019s position. You can\u2019t\nsue me if I tell my friends I think a\nTory peer abused children. You can\u2019t\nsue me if I text them, or even if I discuss it in public. You can\u2019t legislate\nagainst gossip because frankly that\u2019s\ninhuman. Twitter is full of satire,\nopinions and attention seekers. It is\nthe ultimate in human expression,\nnot an o\ufb03cial belief.\nIf you did tweet it, don\u2019t worry.\nThe Telegraph says that his lawyers\nexpect to ask for nominal payment\nof \u00a35 and for the proceeds will go to\ncharity, but this misses the point. Ten\nthousand users are facing legal action for gossiping, most often with\nfriends. This is wrong.\nJula Humphries\nFeminism needs to engage with men if it is to achieve its goals,\nargues Jula Humprhies\nhe word feminism itself\ndoes not include men\ninto the equation. Yet,\nmen should be just as\nactive as women in the\nmovement towards gender equality.\nThis should be the accepted norm,\nwhich it appears to be at university,\nas proven by the high percentage of\nguys involved in the Feminist so-ciety. Certain aspects of feminism\nshould perhaps be solely dominated\nby women; but the majority of it\nmust equally involve men in addressing gender inequalities. If society is\nto act, think and behave differently\nit will only occur through both sexes\nbringing about change. We women\ncannot make change alone for it alT\nways takes two to tango.\nA man who supports a woman\nmust be heralded by society as occurs vice versa. House husbands and\nstay at home dads must be lauded\nequally as their female equivalents.\nOur laws should reflect these senti-ments, terms such as maternity and\npaternity leave should not exist. It\nshould be parental leave, where the\ncouple decides who takes time off\nand potential percentages. Let us\nscrap matriarchies and patriarchies,\nwe need new \u2018archies\u2019.\nElizabeth Garrett Anderson would\nnot have become England\u2019s first female Doctor without her father\u2019s\nsupport. Just as President Obama,\nwould not have become President\nwithout Michelle\u2019s support. The fact\nof the matter is that great women\nhave great men behind them and\ngreat men have great women behind\nthem. People need to be pushed and\nsupported from one another, regardless of gender and societies must\nwork towards this and maintain it as\nstatus quo.\nMore men must define themselves\nas fathers and husbands on Twitter\nand other platforms. Just as women\ndo. A man ought to feel at ease if his\npartner earns more and he should\nfeel proud changing a nappy. A\nMother should teach her sons how\nto ice buns and a Dad his daughters\nhow to change a bog\u2019s lift rod. Women should push men and men should\nsupport women in these actions. Of\ncourse, the pushing and supporting\nshould swing both ways and applies\nto couples of every shape and form,\nwhether they are gay, straight, trans-sexual, bi-sexual or bi-cultural etc.\nSociety, the media and our education systems must be geared towards\nthis. Our societal values should place\nhousewifery/husbandry on par with\nbeing a CEO. Women are typically in\nthe former category and society typically has a higher respect for the lat-ter. This must change. Equal respect\nand opportunity are the pillars upon\nwhich gender equality is and will\ncontinue to be built. And we women\nmust work together with men to instil these changes.\n\n"

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\n14\nLife after the earthquake\nmulti-dimensional national disaster \u2013 an\nearthquake, tsunami and\nnuclear threat from a\ndamaged power plant \u2013\nthat is the situation Japan found itself\nin on March 11th 2011. Since then,\nhow have the a\ufb00ected areas been re-covering? What is the situation like\ntoday, in both infrastructure and the\nlives of ordinary people living in the\naftermath?\nThis September, seven Imperial College students (Ryan Browne, James Li,\nEmilien Dupont, Colin Say, Yingkun\nHou, Dolan Miu and Faizi Freemantle) travelled to Rikuzentakata, Iwate\nPrefecture, Tohoku Region, on the\nEastern coast of Japan to conduct a\nrecovery support project. We aimed\nto impact the area on three separate\nlevels \u2013 the community, public, and\neducational sectors. We wanted to\n\ufb01nd out the reality of life during and\nfollowing a disaster of this scale.\nOn arrival in Rikuzentakata, we\ntoured the city with a local guide. Our\n\ufb01rst impressions were of shock and\nhorror \u2013 ruined buildings, half-stood\nas empty shells, only the foundations\nof houses remained to litter \ufb02at expanses of ground, and the roads were\nstill being laid as we drove. The piles of\ndebris that had been collected immediately after the disaster still remained,\nhalf-covered in grass. We were able\nto see the key symbol of hope for the\nregion, the \u2018Miracle Pine Tree\u2019, a single pine tree on the coastline that had\nwithstood the force of tsunami whilst\n70,000 other trees around it perished.\nThe City Hall lost a third of its employees to the tsunami, and currently\noperates from a temporary site. We\nvisited Mr Toba and Mr Kubota, the\nMayor and Vice-Mayor, to hear their\nexperience of the disaster and to discuss the future of the city. The recovery will take decades, owing not just to\nthe scale of the clear-up operation, but\nalso to the slow process of governmen-Ryan Browne and six others help out in the Tohoku region in Japan\ntal approval.\nThe following days, we visited primary schools to talk to the children\nthere, as well as cleaning the school\nwindows, and holding English activities for the children a\ufb00ected by the\ndisaster. It was amazing to see the children so full of life and spirit despite\ntheir hardship. We worked at Hirota\nHarbour on the coastline for two days,\nhelping the scallop \ufb01shermen there\nwith cleaning activities. The scallop\nindustry in Rikuzentakata used to be\nrenowned, but following the disaster,\ntheir business had been severely af-fected, through loss of equipment,\nand also a fear in the people to eat\nscallops from the surrounding waters.\nWe hoped that our visit may boost\nthe pro\ufb01le of the \ufb01shermen again, and\nour activities there were \ufb01lmed by the\nNHK.\nOn our last day in Rikuzentakata, we\ntravelled to temporary housing sites\nfor people who had lost their homes,\nto set up an English style caf\u00e9. The\npeople who live in these homes suffered not just the loss of their possessions and family members, but a complete upheaval of their community.\nThe temporary housing took months\nto be built, and has cramped living\nconditions and poor insulation for the\nwinter. We wanted to bring together\nthe people who live there and o\ufb00er\nthem enjoyment outside of their daily\nroutine.\nFollowing our time in RikuzenA\ntakata, we travelled to Tokyo to meet\nwith representatives from professional\norganisations such as the Ministry of\nDefence, The Japanese Committee for\nUNICEF, and the Adventist Development and Relief Agency; as well as\nstudent-led groups such as Tokyo University of Foreign Studies For Tohoku,\nWaseda University Volunteer Centre, and Youth For 3.11. The purpose\nof these discussions was to \ufb01nd out\nhow they had separately dealt with the\nEarthquake, and to put forward ideas\nfor how International volunteers can\ncontribute to the recovery e\ufb00ort.\nI believe our project was a life-changing experience for those in-volved, and we successfully ful\ufb01lled\nour aim of positively impacting the different social levels. In any case, I would\ncertainly encourage anyone to travel to\nTohoku region, away from the immediate coastline large cities like Sendai\ncontinue on relatively unscathed, there\nare countless areas of natural beauty\nsuch as Matsushima Bay, and the entire area can feel the bene\ufb01t of tourism\nand international interest.\nOur project was organised by Action\nfor Japan UK, an organisation founded\nby UK graduate students following the\ndisaster, and now co-run by Imperial\nCollege students. If you would like to\nget involved in Action for Japan UK\u2019s\nactivities, please speak to any of those\ninvolved, email actionforjapanuk@\ngmail.com, or visit actionforjapan-uk.\nnet for more information.\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFred Fyles\nBlack humour at Whitechapel\nWriter\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER 31\nAt its core conceptual art has always been, and will continue to be,\nall about revolution. Whether the\nrevolution is against injustices committed around the world, or simply\nagainst current cultural status quo,\nyou can guarantee that the artist\nwill be on the front lines, creating\nworks to make the viewer ask ques-tions. This quality can be seen in\nDuchamp\u2019s upturned urinal entitled\nFountain, which rocked the foundations of the art world; it can be seen\nin Picasso\u2019s Guernica, a gigantic\ncanvas vividly documenting the horrors of war. It can also be seen today\nin the work of Maurizio Cattelan,\nthe notorious Italian satirist whose\nworks are currently on display at the\nWhitechapel Gallery.\nSince the mid-90s, Cattelan has\nbeen creating works that have given\nhim a reputation as the trickster\nof the art world. They are created\nwith a gleeful humour, but more often than not contain a wicked twist\nof darkness. Popes being crushed\nby meteorites, Hitler dressed as a\nschoolboy, and giant hands giving\nthe middle finger have all been included in his work. The pieces featured in this exhibition may be on a\nsmaller scale, but still demonstrate\nhis sharp wit.\nIn one of the corners of the room\nthere is a small diorama of the kitchen Cattelan grew up in. The sink is\npiled with dirty plates and at the\ncentre of the room, slumped against\na miniature yellow Formica table, a\nsquirrel has committed suicide. The\ngun lies on the floor. An empty glass\nrests on the table. The viewer is left\nto make up their mind on why the\nsquirrel chose to end it all, but the\ntitle of the work Bidibidobidiboo, a\ngarbled reference to the song that\ntransforms Cinderella, adds another\nedge to a work already dripping with\nblack humour.\nWhilst the squirrel may form a\nmore personal reflection, the majority of the works in the room are\nattributed with some kind of political commentary. Lullaby initially appears as a giant fabric sack, at the\ntop of which one can see fragments\nof brick poking out. The description\nattached to the work explains that\nthe bag is filled with rubble from the\n1993 terrorist attack on Milan\u2019s Pavilion of Contemporary Art, which\nleft 5 people dead.\nAt the centre of the room is a rug,\nwhose design has been based upon\nthe casing for a wheel of cheese.\nThe jingoistic sentiments surrounding a map of Italy, which may have\nseemed quaint when simply used to\nadvertise cheeses, become reminiscent of language used in Mussolini\u2019s\nItaly, and brings on a deep sense of\nunease.\nOn the adjacent wall hangs the\nsign of the Marxist Italian terrorist\ngroup the Red Brigades but this too\nhas been subverted. Made up in garish neon, it has become a Christmas\ngreeting; the infamous star becomes\nthe one leading the faithful to Bethlehem. This subversion of ideas is\nat the heart of Cattelan\u2019s work, and\nis one of the key tools in his satirical arsenal. Some may dismiss it as\nshock tactics, but the pieces certainly hit the viewer to the core.\nOne of the many criticisms that\nmodern conceptual art faces today\nis that it takes itself too seriously.\nThose of you who feel fed up in trying to find meaning in Hirst\u2019s pickled cows, or despair at the Turner\nPrize\u2019s lack of humour, would do well\nto come down to the Whitechapel\nGallery. Although the exhibition is\ntiny, totalling only eight works, it is\nsteeped in humour and irony, leav\u00a9 Mel Bochner\nstatements himself, and the work\nbecomes a meditation on whether\nphotography is a genuinely truthful\nmedium. Does the camera ever lie?\nLines of different lengths are painted on the walls, along with a bar to\nmark where Bochner\u2019s eye level is,\nrepresenting the idea of proportion\nwithin art. In the centre of the gallery is Bochner\u2019s seminal Theory of\nPainting, in which he explores the\nlimits placed upon painters using\nnewspapers and brilliant bright blue\npaint. It perfectly portrays Bochner\u2019s\nfixation with order and colour, and\nit is my personal favourite in the ex-hibition.\nContinuing upstairs we are treated\nto a series of \u2018Thesaurus Paintings\u2019.\nBochner paints out words upon the\ncanvas in glorious colours, starting with a word such as \u2018Lazy\u2019 before finding a synonym for it. These\nword chains play out like Chinese\nTwo very different artists on show at East London gallery\nwhispers, starting with phrases such\nas \u2018Win\u2019, flowing through into \u2018Crush\n\u2018Em\u2019 before ending with \u2018Kick Some\nButts\u2019.\nIn these works the role that the\nwritten word has in art is juxtaposed\nagainst the role of colour. However,\nrather than being at odds with one\nanother, these two features of art\nform an unlikely harmony, creating a\nseries of beautiful paintings.\nBochner\u2019s work is uplifting and, as\na conceptual artist who has bridged\nthe gap between the art worlds of the\n1960s and today, deserves a special\nplace in history. Contrary to what\nthe opening work may suggest, this\nexhibition is certainly not all Blah,\nBlah, Blah.\nMel Bochner is on until 30th December; Maurizio Cattelan is on until 2nd\nDecember. Both at the Whitechapel\nGallery; free entry.\ning the observer smiling all day.\nMeanwhile, on the floor below, the\nGallery is staging a retrospective of\nthe American painter Mel Bochner,\nwho helped cement New York as the\nconceptual art capital of the 1960s\nand 70s. His raucous, wildly colourful paintings form a counterpoint to\nCattelans\u2019 on the floor above. Upon\nentering the gallery, the first thing\nthat greets one is a gigantic painting\nentitled Blah, Blah, Blah. As the title suggests, it consists of the word\n\u2018Blah\u2019 written repeatedly across a\nblack canvas. The lettering is in a\nmultitude of colours, which ooze\nand drip down the canvas in heavy\nsmears. This acts as an official introduction into the mind of Bochner,\nan artist who is obsessed with col-our, artistic theory, and the power of\nwords.\nThe first rooms of the gallery\ndocument Bochner\u2019s attempts to\nrepresent different artistic theories.\nHis Theory of Photography consists\nof a progression of small cards upon\nwhich quotations from Mao, Zola,\nand other great thinkers are written.\nHowever, not all of them are genu-ine; Bochner created three of the\nThe inevitable result of\nwearing a flannel suit\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\n4 FRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\nHolland Club to close after opposition from staff\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\nNew Research centre opens at Imperial\nLast week a new research centre\nopened at Imperial College London\nin St. Mary\u2019s Hospital: The Imperial Clinical Phenome Centre. This\nis the second phenome centre to be\nlaunched this year in the UK, both\ncentres are based at Imperial College.\nThe centre is led by both Imperial College London and King\u2019s College London, although it has many academic\nand commercial partners. The centre\nis said to aim to revolutionise the future of the healthcare sector, translating medical discoveries to better\nhealthcare. Researchers will rapidly\nanalyse the phenotypes of an unprecedented number of samples taken from\npatients. Blood and urine samples will\nbe used to search for biomarkers that\nlink particular populations of people\nwith susceptibility to certain diseases.\nConsequently, this will eventually aid\nin the development of more targeted\nforms of treatment to combat dis-eases. Furthermore, this information\ncan guide doctors on how the patient\nis responding to a particular form of\ntreatment.\nLast August it was announced that\nthe anti-doping facilities acting for the\nLondon 2012 Olympics will become a\npioneering research centre for personalised medicine. The centre is funded\nby the National Institute for Health\nResearch (NIHR) and the Medical Research Council (MRC), with \ufb01ve year\ngrants of \u00a35 million from both inves-tors.\nThe MRC-NIHR Phenome centre\nis the \ufb01rst of its type in the world,\nenabling researchers to investigate the\ncharacteristics of diseases to develop\nnew treatment for patients. The Chief\nExecutive of the MRC, Sir John Savill,\ndescribed the centre as a \u201cphenomenal\u201d Olympic legacy, with research\nthat is \u201cunprecedented anywhere in\nthe world\u201d. The centre inherits equipment used by the 2012 Olympics\nservices. The Phenome centre boasts\nnovel technologies, where state of the\nart technology, with three nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers and six mass spectrometers\nNida Mahmud News Editor\nthat are intended to give surgeons\nuseful diagnostic information in real\ntime.\nA phenome is an individual\u2019s chemistry due to their genetics and the\nlifestyle adopted. The phenotype consists of the external products of genes\nand the environment, such as disease\nstates and hair colours. The combination of molecules are constantly\nchanging, they are a\ufb00ected by factors\nsuch as diet, environment and stress.\nFurthermore, the phenome is related\nto a patient\u2019s response to a disease or\ntreatment. Molecular analysis will be\nundertaken to aid in disease diagnostics and patient speci\ufb01c treatments.\nJeremy Nicholson, the head of the\nDepartment of Surgery at Imperial\nhas commented on the \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d centre that can \u201cprovide new\nways of understanding the complex\ninteractions between people\u2019s genes\nand their environment that determine\ntheir disease risks\u201d. \u201cMetabolic pro\ufb01ling will give us a new dimension of\nunderstanding about the factors that\ncontribute to disease, as well as crucial information for predicting how\nindividual patients are likely to respond to treatment. These analytical\ntechnologies are now very mature and\nare immensely powerful for telling us\nabout someone\u2019s physical condition\nand disease state. Bringing them fully\ninto the clinical setting will help doctors make a more informed diagnosis,\nchoose the best treatment based on\nthe individual characteristics of the\npatient, and monitor their progress\nmore precisely. It is the dawn of a new\nage of \u2018precision medicine\u2019.\u201d\nTechnology that gives surgeons useful diagnostic information in real time\nalso exists in the centre. For example,\nDr Takats is developing the \u201cintelligent knife\u201d, a tool that can analsye the\nsmoke produced when surgical blades\nthat have been heated by electricity cuts a tissue during an operation.\nThe chemicals in the tissue provide\nin-depth information about the tissue;\nsuch as in determining whether or not\na tissue is cancerous.\nNews Editor: Aemun Reza,\nNida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nthat there are already enough catering\noutlets, and that it is already a place for\npostgraduates and members of sta\ufb00 to\nmeet. Many also commented on their\ndismay at the College and that they believed other catering facilities could be\nimproved instead. It was noted by one\ncommenter that the sta\ufb00 brie\ufb01ng email\ndiscusses the feasibility study and asks\nfor comments to be sent to an email address but does not suggest commenting on the post on the College\u2019s site.\nSue Sharp, Chair of Imperial Unite\nand Treasurer of the Holland Club\nCommittee, said that sta\ufb00 were \u201coverwhelming in support of the club as it\nwas\u201d. She described the bar as \u201ccomfortable as it is\u201d while admitting that\nthe function room \u201cdoes need improvement\u201d. Sharp told Felix that College had\nbeen provided with \u201cample evidence of\nthe Holland Club\u2019s support\u201d\n.\nThe reason for the new outlet was \u201cto\nserve the needs of the College community\u201d. A College spokesman stated that\nthe \u201cspace should be fully redesigned\nto maximise its potential and ensure\nthe best possible service to customers\u201d\n,\nwhich was given as the reason that the\nHolland Club could not serve food it-self. Sharp commented: \u201cIf the college\nis genuine in its intention, why not\nbuild and improve on what is already\nthere and loved rather than tearing it\ndown and starting again\u201d\n. Sharp went\non to state that \u201cthe Holland Club was\nwilling to improve either alone or in\nconjunction with catering [College ca-tering: i.e. Commercial Services]\u201d\n.\nThe new space will, according to a\nCollege spokesman, be \u201co\ufb00ering dedicated pub, catering, social, and activity\nspaces for postgraduate students and\nmembers of sta\ufb00\u201d\n. In regards to cater-ing, the spokesman replied that \u201csome\nof the catering facility will be used to\nprovide evening meals for the College\ncommunity including undergraduate\nstudents\u201d and that this will be done \u201cto\nthe extent possible without compromising the facility\u2019s primary purpose\u201d\n.\nThe plans that were originally drawn\nup for Level 0 \u201cappeared to duplicate\ncurrent facilities already available\nthroughout the College and left room\nonly for a small social bar\u201d according to\nSharpe. However the plans then seem\nto have been altered.\nCollege set up a Design Brie\ufb01ng Advisory Board, which included representatives from the Union, the Holland\nClub, Commercial Services, and the\nSenior Dean. Their work was \ufb01nished\nin July. The new design for the space\nhad \u201cinput from the [Holland Club]\nboard\u201d according to a College spokes-man. Sharpe corroborated that such a\nconsultation had taken place and that\nthey had progressed from the orginal\nplans, but the Holland Club Committee now \u201cbelieved that many of the recommendations had been ignored\u201d\n. She\nsaid that the \u201clatest news on current\nplans would appear to indicate that the\nCollege intends to revert to the original\n[plans]\u201d\n.\nMaryam Habibzay, GSA President,\nwas asked for comment. However the\nGSA were not aware of the plans and\ndid not know what was going on with\nthe Holland Club. Habibzay said that\n\u201cideally\u2026 I would like to wait until\neveryone knows and discuss this with\npostgraduate students\u201d, but said that\nthe Holland Club was \u201cpopular for its\ncheaper drink prices\u201d. Habibzay expressed hope that the new outlet will\nhave similar prices and that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t\nsound too bad from a PG (postgradu-ate) point of view. But many will be sad\nthat it will close as the Holland Club\nhad become a bit of an Imperial tradition\u201d.\nThe future of the Holland Club, and\nthe space remaining as it was, has been\nin doubt for some time, ever since Felix\nreported about the feasibility studies\noccurring. The Union and the Holland\nClub both bid during the tender pro-cess, but did not win. Paul Beaumont,\nUnion President, said: \u201cWe are obviously disappointed that we didn\u2019t win\nthe tender process as it would have\nbeen a good opportunity for a student\nled postgraduate bar. We\u2019re working\nwith Commercial Services to make\nsure it is as student friendly as possible.\u201d\nKevin Young, the Bar Manager, will\nbe made redundant on 31 January\n2013. The Holland Club itself will still\nexist in name, however it will have no\npremises. College have not o\ufb00ered\nany replacement. It was claimed that\nthe trade union Unite asked the College to provide an alternative venue for\nthe Holland Club. However, they were\ninformed that sta\ufb00 would have access\nto the new outlet, and so they will not\no\ufb00er anything. When asked if the Holland Club had been given any alternative premises, a College spokesman\nreplied: \u201cThe Holland Club, as with any\nsta\ufb00 or student association, is free to\nbook space around College for its ac-tivities. However, to ensure everyone\nhas fair access to those facilities, no\npermanent or exclusive access can be\ngranted to the Club.\u201d\nThe Holland Club, named after Sir\nThomas Holland, a former Rector of\nImperial, was formed in 1949 as a social club for non-academic members of\nsta\ufb00. Now, the bar is used by postgraduates and sta\ufb00 (both academic and non\nacademic) as a social place. The bar has\nbeen relocated before. Once the full\nplans for the new space are known, Felix will report on them.\n\n"

A psych rock\nguitarist, he proved himself worthy\nto support Grouper due to his use of\ndrone and a thirst for experimental-ism, but he elegantly balanced this\nwith some more conventional use of\nthe guitar not unlike blues, folk or\neven bluegrass in places.\nAfter seeing him perform a hypnotic\nand enveloping set I set about getting\nmy hands on all the material I could,\nadmittedly not very much. I did, how-ever, immensely enjoy his 2011 album\nParanoid Cat and this year\u2019s krauty\ncollaboration with Koen Holtkamp.\nForsyth performs live with a band, but\nin the studio the experience is quite\ndi\ufb00erent. The drums are completely\nabsent. This makes Forsyth\u2019s music\na much more distant relative of traditional rock and in a way that\u2019s why\nhis music is so interesting. Guitar is\nan instrument commonly synonymous with rock, yet it is the sole guide\nthrough Chris Forsyth\u2019s musical stud-ies. The very instrument that gave rise\nto the musical decadence of shred, to\nthe indulgence of simple cock-rock\nri\ufb00s here sheds its baggage; becoming\ninstead a source of ambient, minimal\nsoundscapes that hark back to the\npast of guitar, its roots in blues and\nfolk with a nod to today\u2019s more experimental ideas of music.\nOn \u2018Kenzo Deluxe,\u2019 this is in full\nswing. Opener \u2018The First Ten Minutes of Cocksucker Blues\u2019 syncs up\nwith the infamous documentary of\nThe Rolling Stones\u2019 tour to support\nExile on Main Street. Its bluesy sound\nframes the musical context of such\nwork, while surpassing it in terms of\nthought and much like this one, every\ntrack is as much a study in guitar, what\nit can do and its cultural landscape as\nit is a great track on a chillout album.\nThis is an album where guitar truly\nreigns supreme. In tracks such as the\nopener, he shows how to be rhythmically astute without a drummer, as a\ncatchy ri\ufb00 repeats under melodies and\nsolos with a bluesy tone and occasionally a bluegrass style twang to them.\nThis song is similar to a later track\n\u2018East Kensington Run Down,\u2019 not in\nits sound but in its structure. Both\ndevelop a groove using a simple ri\ufb00\nthat remains unchanged, modulating\nonly slightly as the sonic environment\naround it evolves, acting as the vehicle\nfor the musical journey of the melo-dies. Until, that is, the songs break\ndown in to a much less rigid form.\nA personal favourite of mine is \u2018Boston St Lullaby no. 2.\u2019 This is by some\nAn Education in Guitar\nRiaz Agahi dissects Chris Forsyth\u2019s latest album\ndistance the most dissonant and dis-torted. I would regard it as Forsyth\u2019s\ntake on drone, with ebbing and \ufb02owing sounds of a distorted and melodic\nguitar, drenched in reverb and layered\nover itself. It has an almost rugged nature with a billowing drone of distortion underneath the melody, and perhaps it is ironic that it is the moment\nwhere he o\ufb00sets ugly and beautiful\nwhere we see perhaps the most beautiful moment of the album, as a higher\nand more ethereal notes pass over the\ndrone like core of the track leaving an\nair of euphoria.\nMore melodic pieces, ambient,\nornate soundscapes are found on\n\u2018Downs and Ups\u2019 and \u2018Boston St Lullaby no.1,\u2019 the album\u2019s more re\ufb02ective\npieces. \u2018Downs and Ups\u2019, in particu-lar, makes me think of America two\nhundred years in the past, with its\nlow tech, barren and insistent melody.\nThese tracks are relaxing and while\nprobably not the best on the album are\nworthwhile listens, be it to chill out or\nbecause they\u2019re simply good guitar\nperformances.\nAnd at the end of the day, that\u2019s\nwhat this album is. I could wax lyrical\nabout how it\u2019s a statement on cultural\nstu\ufb00 or where it might \ufb01t into musical tradition or the di\ufb00erent genres he\nexperiments with, but at the end of the\nday it\u2019s just a guy and his guitar, and\nin a way that is the most \ufb02attering it\ncan get. Forsyth shows his immense\ntalent but also his years of experience\nwith an instrument he clearly loves\nand gives an album that, were it better\nknown, would be a landmark not only\nfor him but for the guitar in general.\n\u201d\nle guide through\nguide through\nForsyth\u2019s musiForsyth\u2019s musi-dies\ndies\nDJ Nature\nPlastic People\nSaturday\nWith Sam Shepherd a.k.a.

With the\nground \ufb01rm and the mercury approaching a lofty double digits, the\nscene was set for a challenging contest against UWE Hartpury 2nd XV.\nWith Cap\u2019n Jack side-lined, or perhaps an unwilling to play against his\nformer teammates, outside centre\nMike Floyd admirably stepped up to\ncaptaincy.\nImperial started well and whilst\neach team earnestly traded blows, a\nseries of good phases of play saw Imperial camped in the opponents 22\nlooking poised to score. Alas, it was\nnot be as an errant pass from \ufb02y half\nGeorge Lane was plucked from the\nair by the opposition\u2019s winger to run\nthe length of the pitch for a converted\ntry.\nQuick to retaliate, Imperial seized\nupon the opportunity provided by a\npoor kick-o\ufb00 return. A mauled lin-eout on the 5m led to a pop from the\nscrum half to the two \ufb02ankers, with\nOlisa Ufodiama rolling o\ufb00 the tackle\nto wriggle through and score a try.\nOlisa Ufodiama Sports writer The fast paced game saw 2 more\ntries a-piece before the half came to\na close, a lack of conversions leaving\nthe home side trailing 19-17.\nThe second half began in much\nthe same manner as the \ufb01rst, before\na turnover by Hartpury led to them\nbeing camped in the 22. After a good\nperiod of defence Imperial \ufb01nally\nsuccumbed and Hartpury opened\nthe scoring again. Two tries in reply\nincluding a collected kick chase and\nstorming run under the posts from\nMike Floyd, and a further try from\nan excellent display of footwork from\nthe Hartpury winger had the score\ntied at 31 all with only ten minutes\nleft to go.\nWith Hartpury pressing hard, a\npatch of poor concentration lead to\nanother converted try for the opposi-tion. Rallying around their captain,\nImperial surged forward once more\nbut they couldn\u2019t convert pressure\ninto points and Hartpury sneaked for\nthe last try in this high scoring a\ufb00air.\nThe whistle blew shortly after;\nbringing an end to this thrilling en-counter. Imperial gave a great showing of themselves as an ever improving side, however mistakes proved\ntoo costly this time round. The \ufb01nal\nscore Hartpury 45- Imperial 31.\nMan of the Match went to Olisa\nUfodiama returning from injury,\nwhilst notable mentions should also\ngo to fresher Tom Hobson for stepping up as hooker, some quality runs\nby centre Mike Floyd and thundering\ntackles from winger Nathan \u2018Brucey\u2019\nFitzpatrick and lock Tom Chavas.\nICURFC is proud to be sponsored by\nCyclists Explore the Peak District\nIt\u2019s 5pm on a Friday as I join 16 other somewhat intrepid cyclists by the\nQueen\u2019s Tower, prepared for a weekend of cycling on some of the Peak\nDistrict\u2019s \ufb01nest roads. The plan was\npretty simple; load up the buses, drive\nin a vaguely northerly direction, \ufb01nd\nthe Youth Hostel in Edale, spend the\nfollowing two days bashing out some\nmiles in some nice hilly terrain. Return\nto London unscathed. Simple.\nWell, not really. Within minutes of\nleaving Imperial we lost the other bus\nonly to be confronted by the inevitable\nLondon Friday night tra\ufb03c. Eventually it eased as we hit the M1 and we\nsoon stopped for a quick \u2018dinner\u2019 (read:\nsandwich) from Sainsbury\u2019s. Our journey continued towards the hills but\nafter a few more hours of minibus discomfort we arrived at the Youth Hostel\nas rain started to fall over the Peaks.\nLuckily the following morning saw\nblue skies and promise of sun at some\npoint. After wa\ufb04ing down a vaguely\npassable cooked breakfast we headed\nfor the hills. The route for the day fell\njust short of 60 miles \u2013 not the longest by any stretch \u2013 but with enough\nclimbing to just about keep the sadistic\namongst us happy including Mam Tor\nand Winnats Pass to name but a few.\nThe climb up Mam Tor was almost\nstraight out of the blocks, a nice (de-pending on your opinion of hills) way\nto warm up on a chilly morning. Midway up the climb Tom Gibb had what\nsome might call \u2018a bit of a mechanical\u2019.\nSomehow the rear derailleur hanger\non his bike (the bit that holds the rear\ngear shifting mechanism onto the\nframe) snapped. Bugger. With no more\nthan 3 miles cycled it was game over\nfor Tom. Back to the Youth Hostel he\nwent.\nAfter reaching the top and letting\neveryone catch up we set o\ufb00 again\ndown a short, fast descent. As we\nreached the bottom (and a T-junction) a view of the road o\ufb00 to the right\nstretched out for at least half a kilometre \u2013 what I\u2019m saying is that if someone (a group of cyclists, for example)\nwent right, you\u2019d be able to see them\npretty easily. We carried on along the\nroute (turning left at the junction) and\nbattered along the smooth, undulating\nroads. A good \ufb01fteen minutes later we\nturned o\ufb00 the main road and waited a\nfew seconds for a couple of stragglers\nto join us. It became apparent that\nwe were missing two from the group.\nOops. A few phone calls later we discovered the whereabouts of Mihai\nand Johannes \u2013 they\u2019d turned right at\nthe T-junction. We pushed on having arranged to meet up later on the\nroute. Surprisingly after not too long,\nwe were reunited at a top of a hill as\nagreed.\nO\ufb00 we set again. We must\u2019ve managed a meagre 5 or so more miles before Dan got a puncture which was\n\ufb01xed in not too long at all. Thankfully that was the \ufb01nal hiccup of the\nmorning and we actually managed to\nget in a fair few decent miles before\nstopping o\ufb00 for some well deserved\nlunch at a caf\u00e9. \u00a33.60 for a giant bacon\nand sausage bap. Bargain. Hot drinks\nwere served in pints \u2013 the north really\nknows how to do things properly.\nA picturesque climb out of Grindleford was a challenging way to warm up\nagain having been sat outside the caf\u00e9\nfor far too long in just lycra. However,\nthe long, fast descent was a brilliant\nreward for the climb up. After miles of\nfast undulating A-roads the main feature of the day was looming ahead of\nus; Winnat\u2019s Pass, a 12%, 1.6km long\nclimb with a maximum gradient of\n20%. One of the hardest climbs in the\nUK.\nAs we approached, the climb didn\u2019t\nlook as bad as expected. A third of\nthe way up I realised I had been lulled\ninto a false sense of security, the climb\nopened up around a corner that was\nhidden from sight from the bottom\nand the gradient suddenly ramped up.\nWith calves and quads burning and\nthe feeling that a vein was about to pop\nout of my forehead I remembered the\nrules of the Velominati (a list of rules,\ntruths and simple cycling etiquette).\nIn particular, Rule 5 which states simply \u201cHarden the fuck up\u201d. With this in\nmind I pushed through the pain and\npressed on to the top.\nAfter regrouping and a little rest\nwe carried on climbing, just a gentle\nclimb back up to the top of Mam Tor\n(the \ufb01rst climb of the day) the descent\nback down the side we climbed at the\nstart of the day was sublime. Smooth,\ndry tarmac meandering it\u2019s way down\nthe side of the hill with speeds in excess of 45 mph were reached. Hugely\nrewarding after such a brutal climb. A\nfew minutes later we were back at the\nhostel. Time for the pub.\nAs per usual with Cycling Club trips,\nthe pub is always a 40 minute walk\nfrom wherever we stay. It is, however,\nalways worth the walk and much food\nand beer was had by all.\nThe following morning again saw\nblue skies with a distinct chill in the\nair. After loading up the minibuses we\nheaded into Buxton to start the route\nfor the day. A few miles in we pulled\no\ufb00 a busy A-road onto some nice quiet\ncountry roads. Minutes later we were\ngifted a dead straight, steep descent\ndown to a reservoir \u2013 scarily fast for\nroads so damp; above 50 mph this\ntime. Beyond the reservoir we climbed\nfor a few kilometers and soon reached\nthe peak. It seemed like the luck was\non our side for the day \u2013 10km in and\nno problems at all. Maybe we\u2019d be set\nfor a perfect day\u2019s cycling?\nNope. Not quite. The \ufb01rst corner\nof the descent saw 6 riders take a bad\ntumble with some \ufb02ying comically\nonto the verge. A combination of damp\nroads, adverse camber and foolhardy\nattitudes could be blamed for this in-cident. Luckily no one was seriously\ninjured, although Pete endured some\nnasty road rash. The most serious in-jury, however, went to Max\u2019s bike \u2013 a\nmashed rear wheel saw the end of his\nweekend. As we were so far from anywhere we were forced to jump ship; a\nfew went back to fetch the minibuses\nwhilst the rest of us waited in the cold,\nunable to push on.\nAll was not bad though \u2013 an extended pub lunch made up for the lack\nof cycling that day and eventually we\nheaded back to London. The weekend\ndidn\u2019t see as much cycling done as was\nplanned and perhaps not as quickly ei-ther, but good times were had by all. A\ntop weekend.\nObviously a huge thanks to our main\nsponsor, Eaton, who\u2019s help in subsiding\ntrips and kit is making the club bigger\nand better than ever!\nGeorge Barnett Sports Writer\nThere\u2019s always one badass\nwho doesn\u2019t wear a helment\n\n"

    "content": "Return of the Classics\nMaciej Matuszewski talks about his favourite classic literature\nespite of, or perhaps because of, classics being\nso heavily emphasised\nin secondary education\nand being beloved of\ncritics they are certainly not the most\nliked of books of ordinary people.\nThey are often considered dry, irrelevant or just plain boring.\nSome of my favourite books, howev-er, are classics and I believe that they\nare just as vibrant, interesting and\npowerful as the latest releases. While\nthey may seem old fashioned, believe\nme, there is a reason why they have\nstood the test of time. Here I present\njust a few of these books \u2013 give them\na read and I promise that you won\u2019t be\ndisappointed.\nAnn Veronica\nH.G. Wells\nOne of Wells\u2019 less known novels this\nis, on the face of it, a love story between the rebellious Ann Veronica\nand her university lecturer, Capes.\nWhile the romance plot is in itself engaging the main attraction of the novel\nis the compelling picture it paints of\nthe di\ufb03culties of life as a woman in\nthe early twentieth century \u2013 with a\nfocus on the su\ufb00ragette and su\ufb00ragist\nmovements.\nWhile not a particularly major part\nof the novel, Ann Veronica might be\nof particular interest to Felix readers\nsince the eponymous protagonist is a\nstudent at Imperial College.\nDracula\nBram Stoker\nProbably the most famous vampire\nnovel ever, Dracula requires no introduction or synopsis. On one level\na simple and satisfying story of the\n\ufb01ght between good and evil, it is also\na masterful exploration of temptation\nand primal desires. The story is told in\nthe form of diary entries, newspaper\narticles and letters \u2013 giving the book a\nunique feel and presenting the action\nfrom many di\ufb00erent points of view.\nSherlock Holmes\nArthur Conan Doyle\nDoyle\u2019s 56 short stories and 4 novels may not be of the highest literary\nquality but the accounts of Holmes\u2019\ncases always provide a fun read.\nCrime and Punishment\nFyodor Dostoyevsky\nWhile at some times it may be fairly\nslow Crime and Punishment remains\na powerful exploration of guilt and re-demption. It does require some e\ufb00ort\nto get into but it is, ultimately, a very\nrewarding read.\nHuckleberry Finn\nMark Twain\nOften called \u201cthe great American novel\u201d the book is surprisingly engaging\nand readable. Following the eponymous character as he escapes from\nhome it paints a striking picture of the\nsouthern United States.\nGreat Expectations\nCharles Dickens\nAn archetypical Dickens novel following the rise and decline of the fortunes\nof young Philip Pirrip, usually referred\nto simply as Pip. Both a brilliant character piece as well as an insightful\nexploration of life in early nineteenth\ncentury Britain.\nQuo Vadis\nHenryk Sienkiewicz\nThe most famous novel written by\nSienkiewicz. Following the struggles\nof Christians in the early Roman em-pire, many translations are available\nand it was made into a major Hollywood \ufb01lm in the 50s.\nFaraon\nBoles\u0142aw Prus\nProbably the most obscure novel on\nthis list, but also, I believe, the best.\nPrus has long been one of my favourite authors \u2013 Joseph Conrad quite accurately described him as being \u201cbetter than Dickens\u201d.\nAvailable in English translation under the titles Pharaoh and The Pharaoh\nand the Priest the book charts the fall\nof Egypt\u2019s New Kingdom through the\neyes of the \ufb01ctional Pharaoh Ramesses\nXIII. While perhaps not entirely accurate the depiction of Ancient Egypt\nis brilliantly vivid and engaging. Prus\npaints a detailed picture of how the\ncountry is run \u2013 making it both relat-able as well as wonderfully exotic.\nThe overarching plot obviously\ndraws elements from the eighteenth\ncentury collapse of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth but can also be\nseen as representing and analysing the\ndecline and fall of old and decadent\nempires in general.\nThe other strand of the novel is the\npersonal story of Ramesses XIII. He\nis an eminently likeable character \u2013\nstarting out brash and immature but\nbeing forced to grow and develop\nas a result of his increasing respon-sibilities. He eventually becomes a\nwise ruler with plans to reform and\nstrengthen Egypt, which are tragically\nprevented by circumstances beyond\nhis control. Prus is a master of tragedy\nand this novel\u2019s ending is unmatched\nin poignancy.\nD\nBOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\n32\nWant to see your name in print?\nSend your book reviews to books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

It legally came into\ne\ufb00ect in 2005 and during this Green\nWeek, we have decided to see if it has\nreally made any di\ufb00erence.\nAccording to the o\ufb03cial Kyoto\nProtocol website: \u201cThe Kyoto Protocol\nis an international agreement linked\nto the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change. The\nmajor feature of the Kyoto Protocol\nis that it sets binding targets for 37\nindustrialized countries and the\nEuropean community for reducing\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\u201d\nThe main idea behind setting up the\nProtocol was that the UN Convention\nwas not committing enough. Putting\nin legal obligations, requirements\nand \ufb01xed numerical targets aimed to\nencourage each of the 37 countries\nthat signed up to visibly reducing\ntheir impact on the environment.\nAs well as meeting predetermined\n\u201callowed emission targets\u201d to reduce\nemissions (which placed heavier\nburden on the \u201cmore developed\u201d\ncountries which historically polluted\nmore), countries were also able to:\n\u2022 Buy \u2018emission credits\u2019 from countries that were below their allowed\npollution, or sell credits to countries\nthat were over theirs.\n\u2022 Install emission-reducing or emis-sion-limiting projects (which would\nreduce targets by a certain about of\ntonnes of CO2\n)\nSince the targets have been\nI\nPOLITICS\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\n16\nPolitics Editors: Padraic Calpin\nMarie-Laure Hicks\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHas Kyoto Really Been Successful?\nenforced, most industrialised\ncountries aimed to cut their\nemissions by 5% of the measured\n1990 levels, though every signatory\nset their own personal target. Britain,\nand the rest of the EU, set their targets\nat 8%.\nThough o\ufb00 to a seemingly good\nstart, with measured reductions close\nto 3% for industrialised countries,\na BBC article from 2005 expressed\ndoubt that the targets would be met:\n\u201cThe UN says industrialised countries\nare now well o\ufb00 target for the end of\nthe decade and predicts emissions\n10% above 1990 levels by 2010.\u201d A\nGuardian news article published in\n2010, however, had mixed views. The\nEuropean Environment Agency were\nquoted saying that a \u201clarge drop in\nemissions seen in 2008 and 2009 gives\nEU-15 a head start to reach its 8%\nreduction target\u201d. Another source, the\nPolicy Exchange, measured emissions\nstemming from the consumption of\ngoods and services to have increased\nby over 40%.\nMeasuring and regulating this data\nwould not have been easy; there was\na lot of reliance on each committing\nparty generating an annual emissions\nreport and the registry system set up\nin Germany was directed to \u201ctrack\nand record transactions\u201d, meaning\nthat parties could not go overboard\ntrading credits and there would be an\nauthority in place to control it.\nNevertheless, not everyone has\ntaken kindly to the policy. Some\nkey players have pulled out of the\nagreement, such as the US in 2001,\nwith the then President George Bush\nIf we taxed\nthe consumption of Carbon Dioxide,\nwould we still\nbe nearing\nthe 400ppm\nmark, regarded as the tipping point?\nsaying that making the required\nchanges and implementing the\nstrategies required would damage the\nUS economy. Canada have also pulled\nout; with their estimated costs at\n$13.6bn (\u00a38.7bn), the government felt\nthat this was unreasonable to pursue\nand was the result of \u201can incompetent\nLiberal government\u201d. The Russian\ngovernment supported this decision\nand pulled out shortly after.\nMore recently, climate change has\nbeen a driving force in almost every\neconomy, whether for or against. The\nCopenhagen Climate Conference\nin 2009 sought to bring countries\ntogether, on a larger scale than\nKyoto, in order to address the issues\nand create an e\ufb00ective accordance.\nHowever, it was ill fated and many\ngovernments, including China\u2019s,\nrefused to ratify it, or simply walked\nout.\nOther talks include the Bonn\nClimate Change Conference held in\nMay of this year. Dubbed Kyoto 2, it\nhad hopes of extending the targets\ninitially penned in 1997, though it\nended in similar disappointment, with\na split occurring between the more\nactively involved parties (such as the\ngroup of Least Developed Countries\nand Alliance for Small Island States)\nwhile other governments were\nmore sluggish and still resistant to\nchange. New Zealand joined the\nlist of countries refusing to sign,\ndespite Australia and many others\ncommitting to stay on course.\nWhat else is possible? Clearly these\nclimate talks are not as e\ufb00ective as\nmany hoped they could be so what\nelse can we do? Perhaps one of the\nfailures of the Kyoto Protocol was that\nit placed emphasis on reducing carbon\nproduction, without mentioning\nanything about carbon consumption.\nA recent Guardian article posed the\nquestion of carbon taxing, which\nwould strike the problem at its root.\nRather than paying for producing so\nmuch carbon dioxide, if we taxed the\nconsumption of it, which includes\nimporting carbon from external\nsources, would we still be nearing the\n400ppm mark (400 part per million\nof CO2\nin the atmosphere), which is\nregarded as the tipping point?\nThe main resistance to adopt any\nsort of climate change reduction\nproject is primarily the cost. Whether\ngovernments or consumers, everyone\ntries to \ufb01nd the cheapest alternative.\nTherefore carbon pricing could\nbe e\ufb00ective \u2013 raising the cost of\nproducing carbon, so people feel\nthat it is no longer the best option.\nHowever, this relies on governments\naccepting it and honestly, even taxing\nwill not necessarily solve the problem.\nNow that Kyoto has ended, it\nis time to once again time for the\ngovernments to get together and\ndiscuss the future. Despite all the\nfailures, many highly developing\ncountries including India, China and\nBrazil will push for an extension of\nthe Protocol. India\u2019s Chief Climate\nNegotiator, R. R. Rashmi said in the\nWall Street Journal: \u201cIf ways are not\nfound to extend the Kyoto Protocol,\nthere could be a period of eight years\nwithout any global climate pact in\nplace, as a new agreement is due to\ncome into e\ufb00ect only after 2020.\u201d The\ntalks will be held in Doha, starting on\n26th November 2012.\nIt seems we have made some\nprogress,butwhilemanygovernments\nstill cannot commit to these talks,\nthen is there really any point in having\nthem? At least the countries that\nhave realised the threat are taking\nit seriously and acting to prevent or\nmitigate future disasters, while the\nrest stand resolutely opposed.\nIISD\nThis week in politics it\u2019s a\nBonn Climate Summit delayed\nby Co-Chair [Second from\nRight] posing for every photo\n\n"

Pop a with-ered, earless Dachshund head onto an\nobese rat, and that might paint a very\nvague picture. Anyway, this is about\npigs.\nAs eutherian mammals we reached\na fork in the road: humans and rodents went one way; cows, horses,\ndogs, and pigs the other.\nRecent analyses of the genome of\ndomestic and wild pigs, under the\nauspices of the Swine Genome Sequencing Consortium, have shed new\nlight on pig evolution.\nThe scientists compared the genomes of ten wild boar and six domestic\npigs from di\ufb00erent areas across Europe and Asia.\nTheir \ufb01ndings, published in Nature,\ncon\ufb01rm the fact that boars (and all\npigs) emerged from South East Asia\nand subsequently spread across Eurasia.\nAbout one million years ago colder\nclimates during the Calambrian glacial intervals isolated the two popula-tions.

However, this drop in\npopulation was more pronounced in\nEurope than in Asia where the LGM\nhad less impact. For this reason the\nresearchers found that European\nboar had less genetic diversity than\nAsian boar.

However, in a country where\none of the two main political parties\nadopts the slogan of \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d\nin its environmental policy, one\ncan hardly be forgiven for meeting\nObama\u2019s green policies with an air of\nscepticism.\nHowever Obama does have a\nrecord of action. In 2009, Obama\npassed the American Recovery and\nReinvestment Act, that lead to more\nthan $80 billion in green energy\ninvestments, alongside with cutting\n$4 billion in annual tax breaks for oil\ncompanies in his last administration.\nIn 2011, at the State of the Union\nAddress, Obama called for 80% of\nAmerica\u2019s electricity to be provided\nby green means by 2035. Also, a\nstrong Democrat stance on the\nenvironmental issues makes sense:\nin a recent survey, 70% of the so\nJoseph Spiking asks: In the land of oil and climate change sceptics,\ndoes environmentally friendly policy stand a chance?\ncalled independent voters classified\nthemselves as environmentalists.\nTherefore, what can we expect to\nsee from Obama\u2019s Administration in\nhis second term? Well:\n\u2022 Renewal of the tax credit scheme\nfor utility scale wind producers, and\nhas pledged to support to aid loan\nguarantees and grants for green energy companies.\n\u2022 Has gained support from major\nmotor-vehicle manufacturers to\ndouble fuel economy for light trucks\nand cars by 2025.\n\u2022 Obama has pledged to uphold the\npower of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate greenhouse emissions. Obama has also\npublicly supported the EPA\u2019s stance\non limiting emissions from old coal\nfired power plants.\nHowever, perhaps the biggest\nchallenge Obama shall face regarding\nhis green ambitions shall come with\nthe Keystone Pipeline System (KPS).\nThe KPS, in its current guise, is a\ntransport system used to transport\ncrude oil from Alberta, Canada to\nmultiple destinations in the USA\n\u2013 ranging from Oklahoma, the\nGulf Coast of Texas and Illinois. In\n2008, an extension to the existing\npipeline was proposed, dividing\nthe American political spectrum.\nMitt Romney promised to give the\nproject the green flag on his first\nday in the White House if he got\nelected, whereas Obama took a\nmore considered approach. Obama\nwas not alone \u2013 opposition to its\nexpansion was heard from various\nbodies, most notably the EPA.\nThe EPA argued that the pipeline\ncould risk the natural habitat of\nmigratory birds and other wildlife,\nalongside considerable concerns\nover the pipeline crossing active\nseismic zones that would greatly\nincrease the chances of a potential\noil spillage \u2013 which in turn could\nnot only destroy the natural habitat\nand wildlife, but also destroy the\nlocal drinking water and the entire\nIskander Malaysia \u2013 as green as they say?\nYou don\u2019t have to be an urban planner\nor an environmentalist to recognise\nthat continued urbanisation alongside green living is the future of the\nplanet. I\u2019m certainly not. So we might\nas well do it right by considering the\nenvironmental implications of new\nurban development projects, and any\nscheme that does this will get at least\none big green tick in my book.\nIskander Malaysia is one such\nundertaking in Johor Bahru,\nMalaysia\u2019s second biggest city, which\nlies across the sea from Singapore\nand is connected to its illustrious\nneighbour by a causeway. Locationwise it is ideal for Singapore\u2019s\nworkers, many of whom live in Johor\nand commute to Singapore to work.\nThe Iskander project is an 850\nsquare mile economic zone the size of\nLuxembourg and three times the size\nof Singapore set to host a population\nof 3 million by 2025. Traditional\nrivals, Malaysia and Singapore,\nhave teamed up with regards to this\ndevelopment, which should bene\ufb01t\nboth in the long-run. Malaysia\ngets a chance to boost lacklustre\neconomic growth and Singapore will\nbe in a better position to maintain its\ncompetitive edge, which is threatened\nby increasing living costs.\nIskander has been touted as an eco-friendly city by the Guardian recently.\nIndeed, one of its main aims is to be\n\u201ca strong sustainable metropolis of\ninternational standing\u201d. The plan\nis that this will be achieved by\nutilising renewable energy sources,\npractising energy-e\ufb03cient building,\nimplementing a green transportation\npolicy, water conservation,\nbiodiversity preservation, and waste\nreuse, among other aspects. The\nwebsite explicitly heralds Iskandar\nMalaysia as \u201ca Land of Nature, Parks\nand Gardens.\u201d\nWell, this sounds great. But as\nI scoured the internet for more\ninformation, I found that current\narticles relating to Iskander are about\nforeign investment. It seems the\nproject is mostly focused on money.\nRealistically that\u2019s no surprise. But\ndoes this indicate that all of the\necological talk is just greenwash?\nCynically we have to consider this\npossibility, especially as upon delving\ninto the website\u2019s FAQ section I found\nthat environmental sustainability\nis not one of the main sector areas\nbeing targeted by the development.\nOn the one hand, an urban\ndevelopment three times bigger\nthan Singapore but with only half\nthe population doesn\u2019t look to be a\nparticularly e\ufb03cient use of space. But\nperhaps the city itself will be dense,\nand the remaining area dedicated\nto biodiversity preservation or food\nproduction. The idea of redeveloping\nan already-urbanised area rather than\ndestroying unpopulated landscape,\nas has been the situation before, is\ncertainly preferable. Yet one protest\ngroup has already accused the\ndevelopment of polluting waterways.\nInspection of Iskander\u2019s\ntransportation policies looks\npromising: with aims to not only\nencourage use of public transport\nor bicycles, but to try and limit the\nadverse environmental e\ufb00ects of\nmotor transport by improving fuel\ntechnology, enhancing fuel economy,\ncar-sharing schemes, and developing\nalternatives to petroleum fuels.\nHowever, I very much doubt it will\nbe that easy to change the minds \u2013\nand habits \u2013 of commuters. Since\nJohor is the primary link between\nSingapore and Malaysia, it\u2019s also\ndi\ufb03cult to imagine how pollution can\nbe reduced when even more vehicles\nwill use the connecting causeway\nevery day.\nIt\u2019s probably (hopefully) too early\nto tell whether Iskander will ful\ufb01l its\npromises. I don\u2019t want to be a cynic,\neven though previous eco-city plans\nhave struggled. I\u2019d prefer to believe\nthat Iskander Malaysia will walk\nthe walk as well as talking the talk.\nThen (but only then) will it serve\nas the model \u201cgreen megacity\u201d its\ndevelopers have envisaged.\nFiona Hartley Writer\nmid western economy.

A commanding set of performances from Oscar-winning Anthony\nHopkins and Helen Mirren should also enhance its appealing qualities.\nCons: It has been noted that this is a simple, fun ride rather than a deep insight\ninto the man himself. Hitchcock still remains an enigma to the industry, and\nthis breezy, shallow portrayal might not be enough to wow the voters when\nthere is much sti\ufb00 competition.\nPromised Land:\nPros: It\u2019s about a man battling his conscience (the Oscar favourite character)\nand it also includes a big, bad, corrupt, environmentally unfriendly company,\nwith a small town of good honest people going up against it in an almost unwin-nable \ufb01ght. These all sum up to become only one thing: Oscar bait \u2013 not that\nthere\u2019s anything wrong with that. And with a cast this good (Matt Damon, John\nKrasinski, Frances McDormand, Rosemarie DeWitt), things are looking bright.\nCons: Compared to other \ufb01lms on this list, the buzz as of now is surprisingly\nminimal, with only a single trailer released to promote the \ufb01lm. Perhaps this is\npart tactical, but the clock is ticking, and it needs a killer set of reviews for this\nto join the main race with the others.\nAnna Karenina:\nPros: No-one does costume dramas better than Joe Wright, who enjoyed immense success with Pride and Prejudice with Atonement. Here he is again with\nhis bold new adaptation of Leo Tolstoy\u2019s timeless, beloved novel. Keira Knightley is radiant in the role of a female heroine not particularly easy to like, and as\nis the case with most costume dramas, the stunning, lavish artworks, ranging\nfrom production design to costumes, are simply divine.\nCons: Too much visual style over a noticeable lack of substance? Not everyone\nwas sold on Wright\u2019s theatrical stab at the story and compared to his other work\nthat caught the attention of the Academy, this one does sadly fall short to truly\nmake its mark in the Oscar race.\nMoonrise Kingdom:\nPros: This delightfully charming Cannes opener received rave reviews in a town\nnot so full of cheery men (Cannes\u2019 audiences and critics aren\u2019t afraid of expressing their views \u2013 they do often boo the hell out of a \ufb01lm) and was hailed as one\nof Wes Anderson\u2019s best. An eccentric mix of childhood warmth and the usual\nquirky humour you can expect from any Anderson\u2019s \ufb01lms, here is a sweet tale of\nimmature love between a couple of pre-pubescent children.\nCons: It\u2019s been out since May, so the interest surrounding this is \ufb01zzling to say\nthe least, and although he\u2019s a talented \ufb01lmmaker, Anderson has never had much\nsuccess with the Academy, and none of his \ufb01lms have ever been nominated for\nthe Best Picture category. Scandalous, but true.\nThe Hobbit:\nPros: Peter Jackson is the man responsible for the fantasy trilogy epic, Lord of\nthe Rings. And for him to stand behind the cameras to helm the prequel trilogy must have been a dream come true for fans of the franchise out there. Ian\nMcKellen is also back in the crucial role as Gandalf as he leads Bilbo Baggins\n(Martin Freeman), a brave little Hobbit, on an unforgettable quest. Andy Serkis\nis also back playing Gollum (give this man his much deserving Oscar already).\nCons: Jackson has set the bar insanely high with his previous trilogy, and the\nphenomenal hype surrounding the \ufb01lm may have a negative impact on the \ufb01lm\nas a whole. And with a single book that\u2019s been split into a trilogy, the \ufb01rst feature\nmay be a dull build-up of better things to come.\nThe Sessions:\nPros: Another Indie smash-hit to come out of Sundance 2012, it features without a doubt the most memorable on-screen couple of this year, as a man con\ufb01ned to an iron lung (John Hawkes) attempts to learn more about sex and lose\nhis virginity with the help of a sex surrogate (Helen Hunt). The direction is sensitive enough to probe carefully around the area, but the \ufb01lm\u2019s not short on its\nhealthy dose of laughter, and this feel-good \ufb01lm should go a very long way.\nCons: Too cheery for the Academy? The voters have been steering towards the\nfeel-good genre for the past couple of years (The Artist, The King\u2019s Speech) but\nthis also deals with the taboo, hush-hush subject of sex \u2013 something that could\nde\ufb01nitely hurt the \ufb01lm\u2019s chances.\nThe Impossible:\nPros: Its trailer is powerful enough to make certain people cry, so one can only\nimagine what the e\ufb00ects of the full-length feature will have on the big screen.\nThe story of survival is often an Oscar favourite, whilst throwing in the concept\nof \u201cfamily bond\u201d will elevate the grandeur of this true story of a family caught in\nthe Indian Tsunami even more. This kind of electrifying intensity will be hard to\nignore, and the emotional payo\ufb00 will most certainly be memorable.\nCons: Not everyone is sold on the soapy, sappy, over-dramatised, tear-jerking\nstory of blatant audience manipulation, and the harsh, cynical critics (who\ncould be amongst the voters, who knows) will not take nicely to the kind story\nthat\u2019s really been told many times over.\nCloud Atlas:\nPros: No-one can deny the ambition that has gone into this project \u2013 this\n3-hour long \ufb01lm covers six interwoven stories that take place over 500 years,\nthe star-studded cast plays various characters over di\ufb00erent time frames, each\nindividual plot is a gripping, thought-provoking one, and the eye-catching visuals are simply stunning to look at. Oh, and this is also based on a best-selling\nnovel. Another box ticked to legitimately enter the Oscar race.\nCons: The critics are sharply divided over this one \u2013 many didn\u2019t appreciate\nits length, some found the awkward casting to be quite problematic, the structure slightly all over the place and messy, and its core message not quite clear\nenough. And this isn\u2019t making money = bad sign.\nFlight:\nPros: Focusing on one man\u2019s self-destructive pathway as he\u2019s accused of drink\ufb02ying (he\u2019s a pilot who\u2019s been drinking), Robert Zemeckis\u2019 return to live-action\n\ufb01lms in quite some time has been described as a fascinating character study,\nwith the ever-so excellent Denzel Washington competently taking on the lead\nrole. His performance is almost a deadlock for a nomination at least, which\ncould also mean good things for the \ufb01lm he\u2019s starring in.\nCons: Although Washington is at the centre of much praise, same cannot be\nsaid for the \ufb01lm itself. Like many addiction dramas, the conventional structure\nas well as its repetitive cycle of a broken protagonist overcoming obstacles for\neventual redemption is a touch too familiar.\nRust and Bone:\nPros: A stirring romantic drama that looks at the complexities of a relationship\nwith damaged (both physically and mentally) individuals, Marion Cotillard and\nMatthias Schoenaerts shine in their di\ufb03cult roles without resorting to any mel-odrama. Jacques Audiard, director of the much-acclaimed A Prophet carries on\nhis successful streak, and he has already scored a big win at this year\u2019s London\nFilm Festival, where his work was awarded the Best Film prize.\nCons: It\u2019s foreign, which will automatically work against the \ufb01lm\u2019s odds, plus\nit\u2019s not exactly the easiest \ufb01lm to sit through, a negative feature not made any\nless di\ufb03cult by its length and a script that seems to slightly drag with its many\ncomplications that arise.\nKilling Them Softly:\nPros: It\u2019s possibly one of the best-scripted \ufb01lms of the year, with so many clever\nparallels to politics and world economics all the while telling the story of a heist\ngone wrong with professional gunslingers coming in to handle the messy situa-tion. The dense, very wordy chunks of dialogue are spoken smoothly by the ace\nmale cast (not a single signi\ufb01cant female appears here) and even without bullets\nand blood, it\u2019s one of this year\u2019s most compelling.\nCons: Audiences expecting the brooding Brad Pitt to wave his gun around\nshooting everyone are in for a sore disappointment, and will therefore lead to\nbacklash over the \ufb01lm\u2019s more text-heavy approach. Andrew Dominik\u2019s \ufb01lms are\ncalm and subtle, and may su\ufb00er as a result.\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\n53\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDodgball Dominate University Champs\nThis weekend saw the Wolverines\ntackle the University Championships,\n\ufb01elding teams in both the Freshers\nChampionships on Saturday and the\nElite Championships on the Sunday.\nOn Saturday, it was the turn of the\nWolverines Freshers to hit up the\ndodgeball circuit in their inaugural\nteam appearance. Interesting pre-tournament tactics included all 6 players sleeping on the minibus on the way\nto Cran\ufb01eld University. Such an unorthodox tactic had never been seen in\nthe Wolverines before; was this a sign\nof things to come?\nDespite complaints that they felt awful upon arrival (maybe the nap wasn\u2019t\nso good after all), the \ufb02edgling Wolverines soon got into the spirit of the\nday, winning 3 out of 4 of their group\nqualifying matches, captained by the\neccentric Cyprien de Saint Guilhem.\nHighlights of the group stages included fantastic team throwing from everyone on board, crucial catches from\nKunal Sharma, and Clinton Chan performing a \u2018suicide\u2019 to the delight of the\ncrowd. Con\ufb01dence was rife within the\nteam; could they go all the way?\nTheir quarter \ufb01nal game saw them\nface the Lincoln Mighty Swans; with\na name like that you\u2019d expect great\nthings from such a team. Indeed, the\nSwans went 2-0 up, leaving our boys\none game away from crashing out of\nthe competition. However, some impressive catches from Edwin Newn\nand David Leonard and some great\nteam throwing saw them claw their\nway back to 2-2. The \ufb01nal game ended\nup being one of the most dramatic\ndodgeball games ever captured on\nvideo, with outrageous catches left\nright and centre (Iacapo Russo plucking a catch o\ufb00 his shoelaces comes to\nmind). Unfortunately it was not to be\nfor the Wolverines, who narrowly lost\nthe \ufb01nal game. Still, coming joint 5th\nin the \ufb01rst tournament for 5 of the 6\nplayers was a great team feat, echoed\nby the fact that Man of the Tournament was a tie between David Leonard and Iacopo Russo.\nAfter hearing news that the fresher\nteam had played exceptionally well,\nthe 1sts and 2nds were determined\nnot to let them down themselves. It\nwas in true Wolverines fashion, then,\nthat the minibus left Sunday morning an hour late. Not one, but two\nof the star 2nd team players\u2019 alarms\nhad failed to go o\ufb00, and a third player\nhad spent much of the past 12 hours\nparticipating in what can only be described as questionable activities. The\nWolverines still managed to turn up\non time on the Sunday, only missing\nTom Bell, who would be travelling in\nat a later stage; and Zain Abbas, who\nalthough was present on the minibus,\nmight as well have been missing. Early\nattempts to recruit a temporary 6th\nman for the 2nds proved di\ufb03cult, with\nrequests to nab the Welsh captain in\nattendance duly ignored. However,\n\ufb01nally they managed to secure one of\nthe freshers from the Manchester Uni\nClub. Despite claims that he \u201chad a\ncannon arm\u201d, after a couple of games\nit was clear that the Wolverines had\nbeen trolled hard by this rogue player.\nA sneaky attempt at sabotage, classic\nMancunians.\nNevertheless, the group stages\nproved almost trivial for the Wolverines, as both the 1sts and 2nds coasted\nthrough to the quarter \ufb01nal round. In\nparticular, the 2nds came up against\nlocal rivals UCL 1sts in the play-o\ufb00s\nfor a place in the quarter \ufb01nal. As is\nbecoming the norm with the Imperial\nsports teams, the Wolverines quickly\nstu\ufb00ed the inferior uni 3-0 with the\nhelp of Tom Bell who \ufb01nally decided\nto turn up, becoming the only university 2nd team to reach the quarter\n\ufb01nals.\nThe 1sts saw a tricky quarter-\ufb01nal\nagainst Nottingham Balls of Steel, a\nteam renowned for their solid, iron-clad, impervious catching. However,\nthe pinpoint accuracy and timing of\nThomas Peake and Steve Ndumbe\u2019s\nthrows proved too strong for the Balls\nof Steel, and the 1sts went through to\nthe semi \ufb01nals. The 2nds saw an even\ntrickier quarter \ufb01nal against Bedfordshire Bulls 1sts. Despite having recruited the ex-1st teamer Adam Cutmore out of student retirement (read:\ngraduate unemployment), they could\nnot stop the charging Bulls.\nAfter the random draw, the 1sts then\nsaw themselves up against the same\nBulls. The pre-match talk showed\npositivity; team scout Nuno Cunha\nhad overheard the opposition team\ntalk, and came to the 1sts bringing\nnews that the Bulls were feeling rather\nbearish about Steve Ndumbe\u2019s powerful throw, a comment which no doubt\nboosted team con\ufb01dence. The tactic\nwas clear; give the ball to Steve every\ntime. Indeed, this tactic very nearly\nworked, with the 1sts coming within\nspitting distance of a place in the \ufb01nal.\nUnfortunately the Bulls just managed\nto overcome the Wolverines 3-2 in a\nbest of 7 match.\nStill, this left the 1sts with a 3rd place\nmatch against Warwick Warriors 1sts.\nDespite a shaky start, solid catches\nfrom Scott Esnouf saw the team clinch\na Bronze medal. All in all, it was a top\nweekend of dodgeball for the Wolverines, with strong team cohesion\nacross the board. With the title of best\nuniversity 2nd team under their belt,\nthe 2nds will be keen to establish their\ndominance, with some excellent fresh-ers rising through the ranks proving\nworthy competition for team places.\nThe 1sts exceeded themselves, becoming the 3rd best university team in the\ncountry, and the Freshers should be\nextremely proud of a 5th place. Man of\nthe Tournament for the 2nds was Justin Ioanna, displaying great leadership\nin his inaugural captain appearance\nhaving taken over as a result of Zain\u2019s\ntragic state. Man of the Tournament\nfor the 1sts again highlighted how well\nall 3 teams had played together, with\nEdmund Teo clinching the title after\nevery player had earned a nomination\n(apart from Will Robinson, soz Will).\nRugby League off to a flying start\nOnce again Imperial College Rugby\nLeague would be travelling to Woking College to play their \ufb01rst game of\nthe season. After some inspirational\nwords on the tube from the clubs\nnewest fan, Henry, Imperial College\narrived \ufb01red up to avenge the two defeats that were in\ufb02icted upon them\nlast season by Woking.\nThe game got o\ufb00 to a quick start with\na try a piece, Imperial\u2019s Stephen Dias\ncrossing the line \ufb01rst with his trademark dive from dummy half however\nWoking were quick to reply with a\nstrong kick chase with the ball ending\nup in a Woking players hands over the\nline for them to score their \ufb01rst try.\nShortly after Dias mimicked his \ufb01rst\ntry but Woking responded, exposing\na weakness in the Imperial defence\nout wide to convert two tries in suc-cession. Imperial regained their form\nand after sustained pressure in Woking\u2019s half, it paid o\ufb00 with Comerford\npulling out a Thurston-esque grubber\nwhich Marek Broda read beautifully\nto pounce upon and score his \ufb01rst of\nthe day. He then followed it up with\na great solo e\ufb00ort, running from his\nown 40 to score under the posts. As\nthe match reached half time, Imperial\nwere only up by 2 due to failed conversions by Padhraic Comerford.\nAfter the break Imperial were \ufb01rst\nto score, maintaining the momentum they had gained in the \ufb01rst half.\nDebutant Oliver Herbage scored \ufb01rst\nfor the visitors and Imperial\u2019s \ufb01tness\nwas showing as Woking\u2019s hooker went\ndown screaming with cramp (though\nsome of the sounds he was making\nwere highly questionable) with James\nBromley who capitalised on the tiring\ndefence. Imperial were to score three\nmore unanswered tries with James\nHolt crossing twice and Marek Broda\ncrossing for his hat-trick. Alex Riley\nproduced some \ufb01ne solo carries; the\nkit bag to and from Woking.\nWoking regained their composure,\nafter some encouraging words from\ntheir head coach and managed to\nscore on the 5th tackle. However Imperial were to have the \ufb01nal say when\nHamish Mackenzie (always the op-portunist) dived on a loose pass in the\nWoking dead ball area to complete the\n48-24 victory for Imperial.\nThe result was dedicated to eternally\ninjured club President David Hobson,\nwho had been watching from the\nsideline and was proud to witness the\nclub\u2019s \ufb01rst win.\nSteve Dias Sports Writer\nSteve NdumbeDodgeball Club Captain\nY u no look at camera!?\nIs the man on the left a giant, or\nare the rest of them his children?\nDespite appearances, this is a\nbrand new dodgeball picture...\n\n"

This isn\u2019t\nthe kind of urge that involves running\nto the toilet after last night\u2019s curry, this\nis the urge to will time to stop, so you\ncan just stand there and take in what\nyou\u2019re seeing. When I get this feeling, I\ncan\u2019t help but get this itch in my mind,\nwhich isn\u2019t satis\ufb01ed until I\u2019ve explored\nall the things. I want to climb that scaf-folding, and see how far the tracks go.\nI want to know whose house-of-tyres I\njust ran through. Where are they? Are\nthey still alive? Does anyone remember that this place still exists? My mind\nraces, and for a moment, I want to be\nmy character, with all the opportunities that this e\ufb00ectively timeless world\no\ufb00ers. Only for a moment, however, as\nthe bubbling lakes of acid, the swarm\nof varkids and the pack of thumping\ncrystalisks detract from this notion of\nabandonment. Damned nature. The\nproblem is that I can\u2019t rightly put this\nfeeling into words, so you\u2019ll just have\nto bear with me, whilst I try to mangle\nwords into emotions.\nIn case you hadn\u2019t guessed, I was\ntalking about Borderlands 2 and the\nCaustic Caverns underneath Sanctuary \u2013 an old city constructed as a base\nof operations for the aforementioned\nmining operations. When you get o\ufb00\nthe elevator at the \u2018ground\u2019 level of\nthe mines, nothing seems out of place\n\u2013 it\u2019s your regular, grey architecture\nthat you\u2019ve seen in earlier missions.\nIt\u2019s when you turn the wheel to open\nthe ten metre high and one metre\nthick doors, that you suddenly feel\ndwarfed by the structure. There\u2019s no\ncomically quotable enemy force down\nhere to liven up your day \u2013 you\u2019re in\na place that even your hardened enemies haven\u2019t ventured into. Your sole\nsources of entertainment are the bugs\nand crystalline monsters that seem to\nthrive in this corrosive atmosphere,\nand they\u2019re not big talkers.\nBorderlands 2 isn\u2019t the only game\nthat elicits this response from the hyperactive cat-trying-to-\ufb01nd-a-sunnyspot part of my brain. Let me take you\nback to Portal 2 \u2013 a source of enough\nquotes to \ufb01ll /vg/ or /r/gaming for\nyears to come.

Considering your immunity to fall\ndamage (a shared characteristic with\nBorderlands 2) you don\u2019t go splat,\nbut you \ufb01nd yourself thrown back in\ntime, to the beginnings of Aperture\nLaboratories (the original name of\nAperture Science), with a speaking\npotato. Portal 2 isn\u2019t exactly the most\nvaried, when it comes to life forms\nyou can interact with \u2013 with the majority of speaking done by recordings\nof long-gone industrialists, or the A.I.\n(Arti\ufb01cial Ineptness) that controls the\nfacility. Or your potato. That being\nsaid, I don\u2019t feel lonely or abandoned\nin the \ufb01rst part, as there are cameras\nand viewing windows all over the\nplace, but once I\u2019ve dropped into the\nruins and pipes of the long-forgotten\ntesting facilities and o\ufb03ces, I get that\nurge again. What\u2019s behind that door?\nWhat\u2019s living in the water at the bottom of the caves? How does this work,\nand where does that collapsed walkway lead to?\nIt\u2019s not just \ufb01rst-person games that\nlet my mind wander either \u2013 Beneath\na Steel Sky (BaSS) is a rather old Virgin Interactive game (so old that you\nneeded to use an emulator to play it\nwhen it was new (a slight exaggera-tion)), set in a large industrialised\ncity and the whole game has a dark\n1984-esque authoritarian feeling\n(think Machinarium mixed in with\nBladerunner) and I want to know what\nthe history is behind the boarded up\nshops, or where all the pipes go!\nI think this whole situation stems\nfrom the idea of being unnoticed by\nother people. In large cities, sandbox\ngames and MMOs, you don\u2019t normally\nwarrant attention, and the world continues past you \u2013 the same as if you\nwere \ufb01ghting your way through the\nsewers underneath London to reach\nan ancient crypt, or watching commuters walk by the news stand whilst\nyou\u2019re 2 miles away, ogling at them\nthrough the scope of your ri\ufb02e. I think\nmy mind goes crazy when it thinks\nno-one is watching me.\nIn most games, the sit-there-and-wait mentality normally makes a token appearance in a scripted event\n\u2013 there\u2019s rarely ever a bonus to just\nwatching the world go by in the normal playthrough of the game. Some\ngames do reward paci\ufb01st gameplay\ni.e. the Deus Ex series, and once in a\nblue moon, the game\u2019s better (IMHO)\nwhen you\u2019re the most cautious thing\nsince sliced bread (I told you all, ages\nago, that I\u2019m not good at metaphors)\na la DayZ.\nThe odd thing is that this is a trait\nthat I hold in both gaming and real\nlife. True, there are times that I want\nto hit (slow moving) people with a frying pan, or eat a hotdog to heal all my\nwounds (let\u2019s not talk about my mushroom usage), but, generally, my play\nstyle isn\u2019t my lifestyle and I hope it\nstays that way, or I\u2019m heading to prison really soon. So, I guess this boils\ndown into what would make a truly\ngreat \u2013 if not iconic \u2013 game, in my\nopinion. So, a good graphics engine,\nwith an immense amount of detail and\nbackstory, and a massive city I can get\nlost in, with secret passageways, sewers and an abandoned underground\ncity. Oh, gameplay?

PS2 games can take days, as you\nrun/drive/\ufb02y around the map, working with your team to capture the points you need\nto win the game. Being free, I\u2019d suggest you all give it a go, and see what you think.\nThe game\u2019s supported by the option to pay for extra experience boosts and quick un-locks, also known as the League of Legends, or Freemium model. It\u2019s been years since I\nplayed the original, and it\u2019d be interesting to see if this game can live up to our expecta-tions. Santa Vanu\u2019s coming to town, baby!\nP\nWe\u2019re landing planetside Wii U\nThe Wii U came out earlier this week, for\nthose unlucky enough to be in Northern\nAmerica. The only impact it\u2019s had on my life\nsofar,isitclogginguptheinternet,somy\ufb02ow\nof Lolcats has slowed to a trickle. I\u2019m happy\naboutthelaunchtitlesthough(includingBat-man Arkham City, and Assassin\u2019s Creed 3),\nand although the graphical side of things is\non par with the XBox 360, the new hardware\nshould prove interesting.\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFRIDAY 23 NOVEMBER\nGeorge Butcher\night now the NUS is\ncongratulating itself\non a job well done.\nDespite the rain it got\nten thousand students\nout on the street, \ufb01ghts didn\u2019t break\nout, there were enough placards to go\naround and the biggest cock up was\nwhen the President, Liam Burns, was\negged and su\ufb00ered a stage invasion by\nthose who don\u2019t like the NUS\u2019s \u2018moderate\u2019 position. I\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\nBut you see, I agree with tuition fees.\nNot a pure, unregulated system like\nAmerica, but hear me out. The reason is that I can\u2019t see why people, who\nvery often haven\u2019t had the education I\nhave and the bene\ufb01ts that come with\nit, should be expected to subsidise my\nelite education. University education is\nelitist, that\u2019s the point of it. To education the best, to be the best. I am the\nchief bene\ufb01ciary of my degree. Me. It\u2019s\nonly fair I should be expected to pay for\ncost of it.\nMost of the tax paying public agree\nwith me. It\u2019s why the only ones to get\nupset at the latest rise, are us, people\nyounger than us, and all our parents\nsquirming as they remember being paid to go to university and then\nspending their time there mostly in the\nunion bar.\nThe Demo2012 march and the NUS\nhave completely missed the point. Our\ngeneration is the most hard done by\ngeneration of recent years. Our parents\nhave given us a situation worse than\nthe one they inherited but continue to\nfollow policies that act like they\u2019re the\nhard done by ones.\nYouth unemployment is at 21.9%,\nand has been rising since 2004. House\nprices have risen above in\ufb02ation for\nover thirty years pushing back the age\nat which people can a\ufb00ord to buy a\nhouse.\nWe are adding to our national debt\neach year and have done for 26 of the\npast 32 years. This is money our parents\u2019 have chosen not to spend them-selves, but to borrow so that their\nchildren can pay it instead. This meant\nthat last year we spent \u00a342.5 billion on\n\u2018Debt Management\u2019\n. That\u2019s more than\nthe government spent on all education.\nThat\u2019s primary, secondary and universities combined. With \u00a310 billion\nto spare. You could more than double\nthe education budget if we didn\u2019t have\nto pay back our debts. We are the \ufb01rst\ngeneration to pay for our own education plus interest.\nOn top of all of this we are also expected to spend our lifetimes paying\nfor the generous pension schemes that\nparents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 generations\nhave enjoyed. The current UK government liability for pensions is \u00a35 Trillion. This has to be paid by somebody,\nand that somebody is any future UK\ntax payer. Old age pension payments\nthis year were \u00a385 billion.\nWe are also expected to pay for the\ngovernment\u2019s PFI scheme, which is\na form of \u2018o\ufb00 balance sheet\u2019 borrowing used to fund projects such as new\nschools currently standing at more\nthan \u00a335 billion. That\u2019s right, it is of\ufb01cial government policy to make students pay for their own new school\nplus interest, typically at 8%.\nThis all makes me very angry and it\nshould make you angry too. Unfortunately there\u2019s no one to shout it because\nthe NUS is full of communists who all\nwant us to sit around camp\ufb01res for a\nliving and \u201cTax the rich\u201d. If you want serious thought on the future of Britain\u2019s\nyouth, I\u2019d go to a daycare centre before\nI went anywhere near the NUS. This\nis the same organisation that egged its\nown President for being too moderate.\nIf you want to see how \u2018moderate\u2019 this\nguy is, I suggest you read one of his Independent blog posts, though you may\nhave to avoid being sick over the bad\ngrammar and clich\u00e9s.\nRedistribute wealth if you want to,\nbut not from kids.\nR\nLuke Sheldon\nTotally shambolic policing tactics\ns the \ufb01rst students paying \u00a39,000 fees have\nstarted this term the\n\ufb01ght against fees and\ncuts to education hit the\nstreets again this Wednesday. Whilst\nthe last National Union of Students\n(NUS) march two years ago saw the\ndestruction of Tory HQ on Millbank,\nthe \ufb01re that ignited from this and saw\n50 universities enter occupation and\na number of self-organised national\ndemonstrations has died down. Cynically this is probably why the NUS felt\nit was safe to organise another demo,\nwith out fearing the \u201cembarrassment\u201d\nof people directing their own move-ment.\nThe stated reasons for the march\n\u201cEducate. Empower. Employ.\u201d, were\nnot exactly inspiring. A number of\npeople retaliated to this focus on employment being the goal of education\nwith the largest amount of anti-work\nbanners that I\u2019ve seen at a demo. And\nthe split was not just in reasons for\nmarching, but in the actual march as\nwell. Whilst the NUS march left from\nembankment over 1000 students were\nrallying at UCL to make their own\nroute and take action to bring about\nfree education.\nWith samba, lots of rowdy Scots and\nplans to target establishments that\nembody the growing pro\ufb01teering from\nhigher education we set o\ufb00. Though\nunfortunately the Met police\u2019s socalled \u201ctotal policing\u201d prevented another Millbank. Every side street was\n\ufb01lled with police and draconian orders\nwere put in place so anyone leaving\nthe route could be arrested. The group\nwas surrounded and we were escorted\ndejectedly to the NUS march.\nPeople may think the focus on events\noutside the march is a strange place for\nthis comment, but that has been what\nhas made the student and anti-cuts\nmovement an exciting place. People\nhave said how the events at Millbank\ninspired them to come out and stand\nup for free education. It is what made\nthe student movement interesting\nenough to reach out to the inner city\nyouth who were a main contingent of\nfees protests nationally, furious at the\ncontempt shown by this government.\nThe actions were also the reason that\nthe coalition dropped all attempts to\nbring in the higher education white-paper, a crude piece of legislation to\nallow the wide-spread privatisation\nand sell-o\ufb00 of universities. Obviously\nthey were too scared to have another\nbattle with students in this parliament.\nHowever, over the last year the anti-cuts movement has been ground down\nthrough su\ufb00ocating policing and Her\nMajesty\u2019s \ufb01nest were on top form\nthis week. Although physical harassment occurred with police throwing\nrandom punches at protestors merely\nwalking along Embankment, batons\nstayed in their waistbands and riot\npolice kept their robo-cop helmets out\nof sight. Instead the very real threat of\narrest and the shear number of police\nwere used to suppress anything that\ncould ignite and inspire further pro-test. One protestor remarked as the\nmultiple lines of police were backed\nup by further rows of police horses\nnear parliament, \u201clook at the health of\nour great democracy\u201d.\nWe profess to give voice to our citizens but yet turn a blind eye to the\nincreasing oppression of students\nwho try and raise their voice. With\nAl\ufb01e Meadows, almost killed by riot\npolice in Parliament Square in 2010,\nstill harassed through the courts two\nyears later on trumped up charges of\nviolent disorder the cost of protest is\nbecoming too dear. How can you invite friends and spread the word about\nprotests when at the best they are\ndull due to police numbers, but at the\nworst the normal living of their lives\nis at risk.\nWe stopped in front of Parliament,\nfacing a myriad of fences, vans, horses\nand angry police (with a surprising\nnumber appearing to take Movember very seriously). This was merely\nsymbolic. Whereas two years ago\npeople were forcibly kettled here,\nnow we stayed here, willingly ket-tling our selves chanting \u201cWe are all\nAl\ufb01e Meadows\u201d. This sounds stupid,\nbut there was literally nothing else to\ndo but walk miles into South London\n(the o\ufb03cial march route) in the pouring rain.\nAlthough the lack of democracy\nseemed to bring a cloud of depression\nover many of the students, the pure\nhatred of the NUS was beautiful. The\nNational Campaign Against Fees and\nCuts, rightly still feeling betrayed by\nNUS joyfully waved a \u201csmash NUS\u201d\nbanner. They were hounded on Twitter for dragging people on a wet trek\nthrough South London. And \ufb01nally\nthe NUS president, Liam Burns, was\negged by a baying crowd of 200 who\ninvaded the stage where he hoped he\nwould address his loyal subjects. However I must own up I never got that far.\nAlthough the student movement is\nnot currently what it was in 2010, the\n\ufb01ght is still going on for a truly free\neducation. On December the 5th students will be taking to the streets again\nin a number of local actions showing\nthat we won\u2019t just march \u2013 watch out\nfor events in London!\nAll I wanna do is *ching* and take your money!\nA\nThe right to protest is being violated by those whose job it is to defend it\nWe should pay for our own education \u2013 and our parents should have paid for theirs\n\n"

These\nrepresentatives rank higher than\nchief constables, and are to be the\naccountable public face of the police.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why you hadn\u2019t\nheard about this, it\u2019s partially because\nwe don\u2019t get the choice in London:\nMay\u2019s election decided that Boris will\ncontinue being ours \u2013 I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll\nhave you sleeping at ease tonight!\nThe picture is little better outside\nof the capital. With an average turn-M\nThe low turnout at the recent PCC elections is a bad sign\nout of 15%, this is the UK\u2019s worst\never election in peace time. David\nCameron puts this down to it being a new role, and people\u2019s lack of\nunderstanding about what a PCC\ndoes. An inquiry is being launched;\nhowever, both of these show the Tories gracefully ignoring the elephant\nin the room: their utter failure to\ninform the public and publicise the\nelections.\nFew people were aware that the\nPCC role had been created, and fewer still knew when the election would\nbe \u2013 I and several of my friends were\nonly reminded by a Facebook status.\nThose who were willing to vote had\nvery little information about the speci\ufb01cs of the role and the candidates \u2013\nthe election\u2019s o\ufb03cial website and that\nof the Home O\ufb03ce are both wonderfully vague about what powers and\ntasks a PCC has, talking about \u201cbeing\naccountable\u201d and \u201cinvoking the voice\nof the public.\u201d\n\u201cVoter apathy\u201d is the explanation\nbeing touted by the media, but there\u2019s\nsomething deeper at work here. \u201cOn\nNovember 15th,\u201d read the adverts,\n\u201ccriminals will hope you do nothing\u201d\n\u2013 a hilariously self-aware campaign,\ngiven the circumstances. Apparently,\none shouldn\u2019t assume malice when incompetence will provide an adequate\nexplanation, but even if the government isn\u2019t wilfully sti\ufb02ing democracy,\nbetween this and the AV referendum\nthey can now look back and claim\nthat the public doesn\u2019t want to vote\n\u2013 something that does not bode well\nfor the future.\nWhat can we learn from the election results? Out of the 41 police\nforce regions, 16 were won by the\nConservatives, 13 by Labour and 12\nby independent candidates. The Liberal Democrat\u2019s death knell was rung\nat the last local elections, and this is\nmerely another nail in the co\ufb03n, but\nthe high independent result is in-Keir Little\ndicative of voters\u2019 dissatisfaction with\nall party politics. The rate of spoilt\nvotes was extremely high at around\n3%. This isn\u2019t mere voter apathy, but\nvoter opposition: people simply do\nnot want elected o\ufb03cials running the\npolice. With this in mind, perhaps it\u2019s\nnot so surprising that the election\nwas so poorly advertised.\nWhether by choice, or more likely\nby incompetence, the government are\nrapidly destroying the public\u2019s con\ufb01dence in the democratic process. A\nlook at the candidates paints another\ntroubling picture: they\u2019re exclusively\nrich, older white people, most likely\nelected by their own kind. With their\nfailure to win voters by one of the\neasiest tricks in the book \u2013 allowing\nthem more control and democracy\n\u2013 the Tories now have little left but\nto hope that the general elections see\nonly rich, older white people going to\nthe polling booths if they\u2019re to survive for another term.\nMoar elections!\nVirgins: quit whining!\nRenos Karamanis\n\u2018ve come to Imperial and\nmy sex life sucks! What\nshould I do?\u201d Shut up and\nrelax!, that\u2019s what!\u201dThat\u2019s\nwhat everyone should do\nwhen problems like this arise. You see,\npeople, we all want to drive a nice car\nbut yet sometimes we are stuck with\na bicycle. What do you do then? Start\ncrying because you\u2019re riding a bike?\nNo, keep working so you can buy a car\nand who knows, maybe on the way you\nwill \ufb01nd that you do not even want a\nnice car.\nNo, guys, that is not necessarily a\nmetaphor and this article is not necessarily about your sex life. I am just\nhighlighting most people\u2019s common\nproblem with Imperial in the hope\nthat you read what I have to say. This\narticle intends not to solve your problem (if such a problem exists), but to\nreduce its dramatic e\ufb00ects. This article is the psychologist of all who read\nit \u2013 including I who wrote it. So sit\nback on your chair, lie down on your\nbed \u2013 whatever \u2013 just enjoy, relax, and\ncontinue reading.\nFirstly I am going to describe the veritable domino chain of situations that\n\ufb01lled me with the inspiration to write\nthis. I have always believed that everyone can create something marvelous,\njust by exploiting those little moments\nI\nof inspiration that occur throughout\nour lives. An inspirational moment\nis a moment of extreme sentimental\ncharge which enforces the person who\nis involved to storm out. The trick is to\ndirect this out\ufb02ow of feelings to create\nsomething. So there I was that Friday\nnight sitting alone in my living room\nwith dim lights, low volume background music, smoking shisha with a\nsweet \ufb02avor of watermelon and enjoying my hot chocolate accompanied by\nplenty of smoke. My plans of going out\nfor drinks with my peers where aban-doned. You see, I was kind of dumped\nby my friends who were either out with\ntheir girlfriends or just not there for\nsome reason. It was one of those nights\nthat one could either start complaining\nin one\u2019s mind about loneliness, or simply enjoy it. I therefore took my laptop\nand NO, I did not visit those websites,\nI simply started writing.\nAt this point you might actually be\nwondering, where am I going with\nthis? Sometimes it can be hard to spot\nthe obvious. A bad situation may not\nalways be a truly bad situation; a problem may not always be a problem. The\neasiest way to discover this is just to\nlook around. I catch myself being sad\nbecause I missed the bus, I am sad\nbecause I did not get a good mark in\na project I was assigned, I am sad because my team lost at football, I am sad\nbecause I got rejected by that woman\nat the bar, I was sad because I did not\ngo out that Friday night. WHAT? We\nlive in London, in the belief that it is\nan enormous city but if we actually\ntake a look at Google Maps (not Apple\nMaps!) we would discover that London\nis just a tiny spot on that planet called\nEarth. My point is that although we\nthink that we have problems, there are\nmuch worse, much more real problems out there in this world.\nI do not intend however to make you\nforget your problems. Otherwise the\ntiniest problems continue to exist as\nproblems, though they cannot be tackled by sitting on a couch and crying.\nMy suggestion is that we could actually do something and the \ufb01rst thing\nis just to stop complaining. I can say,\nwith no controversy, that Imperial students complain a lot, and this is just\nre\ufb02ected in the student satisfaction as\nwell. The most interesting problem I\nhave spotted here at Imperial is actually a pair of problems. Getting back\non the title, guys are concerned about\nthe \u2018\u2019lack of females\u2019\u2019 (which directly effects their sex life), while mostly girls\nare complaining about sexism. Dudes!\nWake up! For the \u2018\u2019lack of females\u2019\u2019 is-sue, when a hunter \ufb01nds no rabbits, he\njust hunts elsewhere, or he even settles\nwith ducks, not being sure whether the\nrabbit or the duck is mostly appreci-ated. And about the sexism thing \u2013 it\nshould be tackled immediately when it\noccurs but it also should not turn the\nother way. Why attempting to create a\nfeminist society to tackle sexism (isn\u2019t\nthat sexism itself?) instead of a unisex\nanti-sexism society? Returning to my\ninitial point, the solution to any problem is not continuous \u2018\u2019crying\u2019\u2019 and\nfrivolous thinking but e\ufb00ective actions\naccompanied with peace of mind.\nAfter all those paragraphs, some of\nyou might think that we went a little bit\no\ufb00-track. The psychologist (the article\nitself) suggests that we did not. We just\nwent through some relieving mechanisms for what could be considered a\nproblem. Hopefully until now you may\nstart going back and forth, remembering your troubles boosting your\ncon\ufb01dence with courage to overcome\nthem. On the other hand, you may\nsay \u2018\u2019gimme a break, you Hank Moody\nwannabe\u2019\u2019. The point being though, that\nsatisfaction is a trophy to be won, not a\ngiven present by any means. The truth\nis that it was 3:34 AM when I was writing this, so I had to go to bed with this\nbeing done. Hence, after reading this,\nyou either wasted your time, or you are\nactually facing your problems (if any)\nfrom a better angle. Goodnight.\nRenos Karamanis enjoys a night alone with his laptop\n\u201c\nw\np\nb\na\ncr\n\u201c\nI am sad\nbecause I got\nrejected by\nthat woman\nat the bar\n\n"

Instead of expanding our\nthoughts and horizons, being lost in\nour interests, we are merely studying for employment. No longer do\nwe study for pleasure, but to obtain\na piece of paper that by increasingly\nslimmer chances allows us to sit in an\noffice for the rest of our lives.\nAlthough the name of the demo\ndemanded \u2018Educate. Employ. Empower\u2019, I was instead marching for\na truly free education. Not only one\nthat we do not pay for (both fees\nand living) but also where the learning is liberating and critical in both\ncontent and practice. Not only is\nour education system exclusionary\nin terms of money and elitism but it\nalso in this process of wrapping itself\nin its ivory tower excludes important\nideas and it fails to look at society in\na critical way.\nAnd funding is intertwined with\nthis lack of freedom in what we\nlearn. If we do not fund education\nproperly it increasingly becomes\ninfluenced and driven by industry.\nEducation becomes about maxim-ising profit for multinationals with\nno thought for the consequences\ninstead of working towards a better\nsociety \u2013 which education has the\npotential to do.\nSo it would appear that yet another\nstudent march has passed with little incident. Aside from mild scuffles at Westminster, yet another ill\ntimed NUS effort to exercise mass\nhavoc upon the streets of London\nhas failed.\nChampioning the mantra of socialism yet again, it seems to be an\nawful case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It seems that\nthe organisers simply didn\u2019t have\nthe time to bother thinking up any\noriginal points to mention. It was\njust the standard regurgitation of\nthe fact that Nick Clegg lied, there\nare no jobs, and apparently universities are more expensive than they\nused to be.\nRather than marching to Parliament Square to hear Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, I\u2019d much prefer to\nenjoy them from the comfort of my\npersonal abode. Notwithstanding\nthis, I really don\u2019t believe that such\na march will achieve anything. The\nnational media have drastically reduced coverage of such barbaric\nevents (quite rightly) and the reason for this is simple: no one really cares. Its about time the likes\nof Liam Burns (NUS Tsar) grow up\nand stop engaging in such childish\npursuits.\nAs for me, I think I\u2019ll have another\ncup of tea. Beats standing in the\nrain...\nGeorge Howard\nLuke Sheldon\n\u201c\n\u201d\n\u201c\n\u201d\nI was... marching\nfor a truly free edu-cation... where the\nlearning is liberated\nand critical\nChampioning the\nmantra of socialism\nyet again, it seems\nto be an awful case\nof d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nLuke Sheldon\nBenjamin Lester Benjamin Lester\nLuke Sheldon\nClamour as baton sale uses free\ndoughnuts to\nlure in punters\nEmbarrassment\nas protester was\nactually offering\nsex for a price\nWell, it\u2019s officially the\ndepth of winter.
