    "content": "FELIX on food\nCompiled and photographed by Roland Flowerdew and Richard E\\ ers.\nIntroduction\nIn response to an ad in FELIX (2nd Feb), two first year\nstudents, Colin and Liz from Mech Eng, reviewed five\nIC food outlets last week. They had no previous\nassociation with FELIX or the Union.\nThey were given \u00a32 each per day, and separately\nvisited one outlet, chosen at random, each day. They\nwere asked to comment on the appearance of the\nplace they visited, how long they had to wait, what\nthey bought and how much it came to. The only\nrestriction on what they chose was that the total\nshould be less than \u00a32, and they should not choose\nthe same as each other at a particular outlet.\nRegarding the food itself, they were asked to\ncomment on quantity and quality, and finally on value\nfor money. The aim throughout has been to provide\nconstructive and objective criticism on an impartial\nbasis. Colin and Liz were trailed by FELIX\nphotographers, but did not make contact with them\nuntil the food had been bought, and so should have\nbeen treated as normal students. Finally, the\nmanagers were invited to comment upon the reviews.\nMain dining hall QT\nAppearance\nThe MDR was reasonably clean, although dirty plates\nwere left on the tables. The kitchen looked clean, food\nbeing prepared on plates in advance. The atmosphere\nwas rather like a canteen, and the staff appeared\ninterested in what they were doing. Colin said the\nplace 'was very busy, and I only just got a seat'. Liz\nsaid it was 'not used by many students when I was\nin'.\nThe main criticism was that the cutlery appeared\ndirty.\nFood\nLiz bought (without having to wait), bacon, sausage,\ntomato and chips, and a can of Coke, for \u00a31.60.\n'Some of the food looked as though it had been sitting\naround for ages, and it wasn't particularly hot,' this\nwas at 1,30pm. Of the food she said; 'the portion of\nchips given was fairly large, but the rest wasn't very\nbig. It was all a bit greasy.'\nColin also did not have to wait, and he chose chilli,\nrice and chips, and Angel Delight dessert, costing\n\u00a31.99. He said the chips were 'very good', the rice\nwas 'OK', but the chilli was 'a little mushy,' the\nindividual portions were 'generous,' but the selection\nwas small.\nValue\nColin said 'quite good, especially if prepared to spend.\nIt is no good for snacks.' Liz thought the value was\nonly reasonable.\nAppearance\nQT was kept very clean, and was constantly being\ntidied. The kitchen seemed clean. QT is situated in a large room, with plenty of seats, the availability of\nwhich depends very much on the time you go. Colin\nsaid 'the seats are very nice to sit in over a lunchtime.'\nThe staff in general were not friendly or\ncommunicative, and the appearance of a photographer gave rise to a lot of dirty looks. Colin\nsaid the staff 'don't say anything', and the cashier\n'just put his hand out expecting money to be put into\nit.' Liz said it was a 'very help yourself atmosphere.\nThey both said that prices were not clearly marked\nand it was difficult to choose within a budget.\nFood\nLiz chose crisps, diet Pepsi, ham roll and a walnut\nslice, the total came to \u00a31.60. She said 'the roll was\nstodgy, but the walnut slice was nice and gooey.' She\ncomplained about the roll, taking it back. The staff\nwere polite but passed her around; eventually the roll\nwas exchanged. She queued for five minutes.\nColin chose an Imperial burger, a can and hot apple\npie, which came to \u00a31.85. He waited about two\nminutes. He was particularly critical of QT's own food:\n'the burger was horrible, the salad was all droopy, the\nmayonnaise was tasteless, and the actual meat was\nnot cooked properly. The apple pie was the same as\nthe McDonalds/Wimpy sort, and although small,\ntasted nice.'\nValue\nLiz thought it was 'quite good value for money, and\nyou could get a reasonable quantity for \u00a3 2 ' .\nColin was unimpressed-'this definitely wasn't good value at all.'\nFrom these comments it seems that the pre-packed\nfood is much better than QT's own.\n\n"

He accused\nCollege of blocking the Astroturf so that they could\nuse the Harlington Trust to finance other projects,\nsuch as the money to be donated to the Merger\nAppeal.\nThe tenders were obtained by an outside consultant,\nrecommended by the Hockey Association. He has\nbeen described by a cost estimator for a well-known\nAstroturf company as 'very specialised with a very\nlarge tendency to produce a Rolls Royce style hockey\npitch.' The company have said that they believe they\ncould lay a suitable pitch for \u00a3100,000 less than the\ntender being recommended by the consultant, which\nwas \u00a3475,000, including the consultant's fees. Other\nsources have confirmed that the pitch should not cost\nmore than \u00a3250,000 to lay\nMr Turner said that 'It would be shameful if the\n(hockey) club were restricted next year by having no\nhome ground to play on.'\nMSF action\nThe Imperial College Manufacturing, Science and\nFinance Trade Union (MSF) are officially in dispute\nwith the College over the potential redundancies of\nseven College staff, as reported last week.\nThe MSF have a policy of non-co-operation with\nthe company to which the staff were formerly\nseconded, Imperial Biotechnology Limited (IBT).\nThey are refusing to maintain the company's facilities\nand are not delivering internal mail.\nChris Stringer, IC MSF Chairman, said that he\nexpected support from the National MSF to be\n'forthcoming fairly quickly'. He said that IC MSf\nwere getting in touch with the Commission Auditor\nGeneral concerning possible misappropriation of\nCollege funds to support IBT. He said that they were\nalso informing the Health and Safety Executive of\nunsafe working practices that were occurring since\nthe staff were dropped. He cited staff working alone\nlate at night as an example of this.\nMr Stringer said he also wished to express the\nMSF's thanks to the Department of Biochemistry\nwhich has provided temporary employment for the\nstaff during their three months redundancy. He said\nthat the MSF would be holding a branch meeting next\nweek at which he would ask for support for more\naction.\nImperial College Union's Postgraduate Affairs Officer\n(PGAO) Martin Gans resigned on Wednesday\ncomplaining about the lack of interest in the Union\namong postgraduates.\nMr Gans explained that although he is nominally\nin charge of coordinating the work of the departmental\npostgraduate representative groups, there has been\nlittle interest in these groups and he felt that he was\nno longer able to do his job properly. Postgraduates\ncomprise 40% of all students at Imperial College, and\nhave a budget of \u00a31000 set aside for them by the\nUnion. If they want anything done from now on, Mr\nGans told FELIX, they 'will have to get off their\nbacksides'\nVote vote vote\nThe ICU elections have started slowly, by 5.30pm Thursday, only one candidate had signed up for each\nof the four sabbatical posts. Paul Shanley is standing\nfor Union President, proposed by Andy Bannister;\nBen Turner is standing for Deputy President,\nproposed by Dave Osborne; Murray Williamson is\nstanding for Honorary Secretary, proposed by Ralph\nGreenwell and Chris Stapleton is standing for FELIX\nEditor and Print Unit Manager, proposed by Jackie\nScott. All the candidates are fully seconded apart from\nMr Turner.\nPapers will remain up until 5.30pm Friday 23rd February.

Points are awarded on rarity and\nem baras s ment value.\nIt was won by a team of Electrical Engineering\nFirst-Years calling themselves the 'Slightly Arseholed\nSociety'. Trailing behind them in second place were\n'The Great Independent Racy Ladies' (GIRL) with\nthe RCS coming in third. The award for the greatest\nalcohol consumption by a single team went to the\nthoroughly inebriated 'Captain Paralytic and the\nBoys.'\nAlthough City and Guilds officially and strenuously\ndeny it, it is believed that one team was arrested\nclimbing the wall of the Jamaican Embassy in search\nof a flag which had apparently already been taken\ndown. An informed source told Felix that at the time,\nthe team in question were not wearing trousers.\nSources close to the team confirmed that they had been\narrested for being drunk and disorderly but had not\nbeen charged. They were released at half-past-two\nthat night.\nfor free\nRASP, a new careers magazine written by recent\ngraduates, was launched this week. The magazine is\nindependent of major employers and publishing\nhouses and aims to give a realistic view of life in\nemployment. Its editor, Emma Mahoney, claims that,\nunlike some of the more mainstream publications, the\nmagazine will be able to carry articles which were\ncritical of employers or careers.\nRASP will be published bimonthly and is available\nfree from the FELIX Office or with FELIX in\ndepartments.\nall departments.\nIn the Constituent College Union elections,\nnominations have closed for the new executive of the\nRoyal College of Science Union (RCSU).\nThe candidates are: President: E.D 'Sa (Physics\n1), S.

    "content": "Gardens Belushis\nAppearance\nThe outlet was clean and light, and had a generally\npleasant atmosphere. The kitchen seemed clean, but\nthe staff were abrupt and uncommunicative. The\nclientele appeared to be mainly College staff rather\nthan students. Again, there was no problem with the\nseating, but the seats were awkward because 'you\nhave to clamber over to get into them'.\nFood\nColin bought spare ribs, chips and ve g, costing \u00a31.94.\nHe had to wait 5 minutes. The food was 'OK\u2014edible',\nand the portion he got was reasonable, although the\nspare ribs turned out to be mostly bone. 'You cannot\nbuy a dessert as well without spending more than \u00a32.'\nIt was not apparent whether smoking is allowed.\nLiz bought fish in cheese sauce, potatoes and\nsweet corn, with orange juice, totalling \u00a31.97. She\nsaid 'the food was nice although the vegetables were\na bit overdone and soggy. All the food looked good,\nwith a choice of about five different things and with\na selection of vegetables and puddings. I didn't have\nto wait at all.'\nValue\nColin said there was 'not enough food for the money,'\nand he was still hungry. Liz said it was 'a bit pricy'.\nWe felt that you could get a good meal from here, for\nunder \u00a33.\nLiz tries a pizza in Belushis\nUnion snack bar\nAppearance\nLiz and Colin both said that the Snack Bar was 'messy,\nrubbish and trays were left on the tables, but the\nkitchen area appeared to be clean.' The staff (mainly\nstudents) were friendly and helpful. Despite the no\nsmoking signs, lots of people in the Snack Bar were\nsmoking. Seating was in short supply except towards\n1.30pm. Food\nLiz had to wait 25 minutes before getting a roll with\ncottage cheese and salad, a doughnut and a can of\ncoke, \u00a31.55. No diet drinks were available. She said\nthat 'the roll was nice and tasted fresh, being made\nup while you wait. There was plenty of filling, but the\ndoughnut was small for 35p.' Colin also had to wait, this time for 20 minutes. He\nbought a veggie burger in a bun and chips, treacle roll\nand custard, and a can of Coke, \u00a31.95. He thought\n'the chips weren't cooked enough and were a bit\ngreasy, and the veggie-burger didn't taste particularly\nnice. The treacle roll was solid, but the custard was\ngood.' He added that 'the portions were a reasonable\nsize'.\nValue\nLiz thought that the value was good and, although\nmaking sandwiches up to order takes more time, it\nis a good idea because you can choose exactly which\nfilling you want. However, she said that the system\nof paying was silly (one till for sandwiches and one\nfor others) because 'if you want a roll and something\nelse it completely throws the staff.\nColin said 'if the food was good, it would have been\ngood value.'\nAppearance\nBelushis seemed to be slightly run down and scruffy,\nbut the general atmosphere was good. The staff were\nmainly students and were friendly. Hygiene was\nreasonable, although one staff member was seen\nstirring topping around with his fingers. There was no\nproblem with seating.\nFood\nColin bought a baked potato and a roll: total \u00a31.87,\nafter waiting 15 minutes. The potato was slightly\noverdone, but the salad and cheese were fresh.\nLiz bought a6V2\" pizza with three toppings for\n\u00a31.80, waiting 15 minutes. She was unable to buy\na drink as well with her \u00a32. 'Very tasty although a little\ngreasy, but the plastic knife and fork are inadequate\nif used. The pizza was small for its price and no\ndesserts were available.'\nValue\nColin: Good value for money, mainly due to the\nquantity available.\nLiz: Reasonable.\nMANAGERS' COMMENTS\nWe asked Rob Northey (Catering and Conference\nManager) to comment on this review. He thought that\nit was 'not as bad as it could have been', and that the\nreview was 'fair and objective'. He said that the main\nproblem with QT is that it handles far more business\nthan it was designed for (averaging 2,500\ntransactions on a busy day), and because of this\nvolume, food has to be made in advance and\ninevitably the quality suffers. Of the MDH, he said that\nif staff were employed to clear plates then prices\nwould have to rise to pay them: the system is\nsupposed to be self-clearing. He also said that\ncompared with prices outside, the College catering\ncosts were very reasonable, partly because term-time\ncatering is sub sidi sed by conferences.\nMr Dave Williams (IC Union Deputy President) said\nthat last week was the introduction of the new system\nin the Union Snack Bar, and that they were surpise d by the number of people buying from them. 'I'm pleased that people thought that overall it was good\nvalue,' he said. The paying system has been revised\n(Liz's comment), and drinks can be bought from the\nvending machine outside. He suggested that people\nbuy freshly made rolls during the morning, and take\nthem away for later consumption, thus avoiding the\nlunch-time rush.\nCONCLUSION\nAs can be seen from Liz and Colin's comments, the\nquality of food available from these five outlets is\nvariable and none of them are good in all respects. It\nseems that places predominantly staffed by students\nhave a friendlier atmosphere, and treat their\ncustomers as people rather than automatons. They\nalso tend to be cheaper, but not as efficient at keeping\nthe eating area free of dirty plates and litter. Places\nwith non-student staff tend to be more expensive, but\nprovide better food.\nBecause these outlets aim to meet different\nrequirements, it would be unfair to place them in any\norder, so we have listed the places we would choose\nif we wanted:\nCheap and filling lunch: Belushis, Snack Bar\nRolls: Snack Bar\nDinner (budget) Main Dining Room\nDinner: The Gardens\nTake-away: QT pre packed 'Healthy option': Snack Bar\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "FeliX Afro-Caribbean Society\nOn reflection, I regret the inclusion of the phrase 'Afro-Carib Drug Frenzy' in last week's Whats On. I have\napologised to the society and its members in a letter\nand there is a formal apology in the whats on page\nthis week. I have no regrets over the news story or\neditorial, however.\nThis week's FELIX contains a number of letters on\nthe subject of the Afro-Caribbean Disco and its\ncoverage in FELIX. I accept some of the points\ncontained within them but not all of them. I found the\nviews of A Jegede and B Brito disturbing. To say that\npeople should hand in their valuables if they go to an\nAfro-Caribbean Disco or they will pay 'the\nconsequences' is tantamount to condoning mugging.\nA group which organises an event is responsible for\nthe safety of those attending. A Jegede and B Brito\nhave shown an irresponsible attitude which I find\nabhor ent and beneath contempt.\nThe President of Afroc has taken a blind-eyed\napproach to the subject. He still refuses to condemn\nthe violence at the event in question and seems happy\nto deny that anything illegal ever took place. Now he\nhas used this week's International Night as a chance\nfor blackmailing the Union into allowing further room\nbookings for Afroc. Afro-Caribbean Society\nthreatened to pull out of International Night last Friday\nand have been out to get all they can from the\nsituation ever since. The Union is wrong to have\nbacked down in this way. There will be an AfroCaribbean Disco at International night, tonight but\nUnion Card checks will be enforced.\nHarlington\nIt is a long time since the conniving g it award was\nmade. This week has seen the honour fall upon Sir\nEric Ash for the third time. I now intend to acquire a small trophy and have it engraved. As a three times\nwinner, Sir Eric will now have the honour of keeping\nthe award.\nSir Eric has seen fit to try and dip his hands into the\nHarlington Trust for the purposes of residences. It\nwould seem that he has made a deal with the Dean\nof St Mary's with money which belongs to the\nstudents of Imperial College Union. Of course, his\nmemory is blurred on the exact details (his age you\nknow), but it seems that the students at St Mary's have offered \u00a3 '/a million towards the cost of a new\nhall. Well that's what Prof Richards said, or something\nlike that. Funnily enough, it's not what the St Mary's student Union said. I just wish I had the power to play\naround with so much of other people's money.\nThe question of the hockey pitches at Harlington\nmay be related to this. Perhaps a stop has been placed\non the plans to help pay for this new hall. What is\ncertain is that Imperial College's Hockey players will\nnot have anywhere to play next year. The quotes\nobtained by the college now seem to be for a new\nWembley Stadium at Harlington, rather than an\nAstroturf pitch. Either the College has employed a two\nyear old clown who can't count to obtain quotes for\nthis work, or they have obtained excessively high\nquotes in order to stop work going ahead on the new\npitch. At present, the College is in credit at the bank\nbecause of funds like the Harlington trust. Now they\nseem eager to realise these assets before it is too late.\nLetters\nLast week's issue contained a letter from 'Rachel\nStone.' The letter, which criticised the news coverage\nin FELIX was accepted in good faith through the\ninternal mail. Ms Stone came into FELIX on Friday to\nexplain that the letter was not from her. At present,\nFELIX trusts people to put their own name on letters.\nWhoever the spineless shit was who sent the letter;\nyou didn't bother me, but you upset Rachel, I hope\nyou're happy.\nSabbatical Elections\nI hope that this year's candidates have read the\ndeadlines for publicity production.

    "content": "Hockey\nAfter an excellent quarter final with Sheffield, IC 3rd Hockey team moved into the unknown territory of the\nsemi-finals, a clash with Bristol beckoned.\nThe first half began with Bristol's strong possession\nplay holding IC's quick breaking style at bay. The first\nhalf remained goalless with both sides having chances\nto go ahead.\nWith the effort increased and the legs tiring, gaps\nopened and so did the play. Short corners on both\nsides were not capitalised on but Bristol, after ten\nminutes of sustained pressure, broke the deadlock\nwith a powerful short corner. Literally minutes later\nBristol broke again and scored with IC still stunned\nfrom the previous goal.\nWith the score at 2-0, IC increased the pressure for\nan opening and in the last minute received a penalty\nflick, which Ian McGovern slotted home.\nThe final score of 2-1 left IC in no way disgraced\nas the first team in IC history to reach a team UAU\nsemi-final. It is a shame that the powers-that-be ignore\nsport in general at this College when the participants\ngain so much benefit from it.\nGuilds rugby\nPreparations for the 1990 City and Guilds RFC tour\nto Paris began in earnest on the evening of February\n2. Team members met in the Queens Arms for the\ncompulsory consumption of the elixir that was to\nsustain us throughout the forthcoming ordeal.\nAdjourning to the charming surround of the Union\nSnack Bar we were introduced to Nelson, our\nenigmatic and cuddly tour mascot. Could it be that\nhis permanent grimace foretold of the riotous\nweekend that he was about to witness?\nCould it also have been that Providence was trying\nHis best to prevent Imperial's single handed attempt\nto hinder the already precarious road towards a single\nEurope? But, alas to no avail. The hurricanes and ferry\ncancellations couldn't prevent the team leaving\nVictoria, somewhat belatedly, and arriving at Dover\nto connect with the packed ferry. The unlucky\npassengers of the ferry were confronted with hoards\nof rugby supporters singing in unison. Needless to say\nmost people were unable to sleep during the short\ncrossing.\nSimilarly, on the train from Calais to Paris, sleep was\nfor esa ken for song: most of our new found friends\nCross country\njoining in. On arrival the weary team was whisked\naway by our hosts, L 'Ecole Polytechnique, to their\nspacious campus at Palaiseau. Using an old tactic\ndesigned to tire and de moral is e, our opponents led us\naround aimlessly whilst we still carried our luggage\nand then hastily served us breakfast out of a cardboard box. Within 30 minutes we were on the\nfield playing.\nGuilds emerged winners after a hard fought battle.\nThe final score, 4-0, didn't do justice to an exciting\nand well played game. Our only score came from Andy\nGodbhere's opportunist kick and follow through. The\nhigh winds made goal kicking almost impossible,\nespecially so in the second half. Towards the end of\nthe match team members were starting to show signs\nof fatigue, a factor that will be very important if Guilds\nwant to win this year's Sparks Cup.\nPolytechnique, with their usual hospitality, provided\nus with a magnificent lunch, which lead us up nicely\nto watch the England versus France match live in their\nUnion. England's convincing victory over the French\ncrowned the tour perfectly well, for us anyway.\nPistol\nThe rain drove down, the gales roared. Hurricane\nconditions forced the cancellation of many a sporting\ncontest, Feb 7, but it takes more than this to repress\nthe unswerving dedication of the true Harrier. The\nbeleaguered IC Cross Country Team took up the\nchallenge of Richmond Park, as its fated quest for the\nLondon Colleges League Title reached the penultimate\nstage.\nWith the established vanguard of the Club executive\nreduced to a purely spec ta ting role, it was down to\nthe fresh blood of the first years to ensure the\ncontinuing survival of the flagging IC challenge. Once\nagain Paul Northrop stormed around to achieve a third\nplace in the race and retain his leadership of the overall\nindividuals table. Dave Knight, in his last cross country\nrace for the College, finally made the top twenty, with\na characteristic surging second lap. Solid support was\nprovided by Laurence Fowkes, Bill Skailes and Jim\nWatson, all of whom ran to form. At this stage of the\nseason, every point scored counts, and the sight of\nSkailes overtaking five men in the last fifty metres was\na sight for sore eyes. A similar performance at the last\nleague race will ensure medals for the boys,\nmeanwhile we must take responsibility for the large\nnumbers of athletic bodies which will be populating\nIC this weekend, as the 42nd Hyde Park Relay gets\nunderway.\nIC\u2014713 Cambridge-720\nAfter a closely fought match, IC lost by a margin of\n7 points. Special mention must be made of James\nHurr who shot an incredibly bad score of 227/300.\nThis has been explained by the fact that he has no\nshooting ability what s over. Simon Taylor, who had\nnever shot in a pistol match before, achieved\n233/300. Tim Griffiths scored 250/300, the highest\nscore of the match.\nOur next match is on Sunday, when we will quite\ndefinitely beat Cambridge and Leeds. As Nigel Lawson\nwould say 'The last match was only a blip'.\nPage 15\n\n"

    "content": "Payment of the Poll Tax\nBills will be sent at the end of March or beginning of\nApril. You will have the option of paying the whole\namount at once or in ten instalments. A payment does\nnot add to the overall cost and avoids the situation\nof having to claim money back if you move to another\narea part way though the poll tax year which runs\nfrom April 1 to March 31.\nMany of you will have been asked whether you\nwould like to pay your poll tax by direct debit or\nstanding order. This is NOT advisable because:\n1. Money would be taken out of your account at the\nsame time each month thereby giving you less\nflexibility with budgeting your expenditure. You may\nprefer to delay payment for a few days because you\nare waiting for funds or have other expenses.\nRemember: banks make higher charges for\nadministering standing orders and direct debits if there\nare insufficient funds to cover them.\n2. In the case of direct debits you would be giving the\nLocal Authority the power to change the amount of\nthe payment at any time without your consent.\nThe best methods by which to make payment are by\ncash or cheque through the bank or by post direct to\nthe community charge office. At present there are no\narrangements to pay at the Post Office.\nCertificates\nIn order to satisfy the CCRO that you are a full-time\nstudent they must have sight of the poll tax certificate\nthat was issued to you when you registered as a student with the College. If your certificate has not\nbeen sent to the Local Authority by the time the bills\nare prepared you will be billed for the full amount of\npersonal charge for your area.\nMost students have already been asked to send in\ntheir certificates or have presented them of their own\naccord. If you have not yet sent in your certificate you\nshould do one of the following:\n1. Find out where your community charge office is and\ncall in person with the certificate. A member of staff\nwill either photocopy the certificate or make a note\nthat it has been seen.\n2. Post the certificate to the community charge office\nwith a letter clearly showing your name and address.\nIt is most important that your address is attached to\nthe certificate as otherwise it will not be possible to\nlink it up with your registration or return the certificate\nto you. Some Local Authorities will accept\nphotocopies, eg Westminster and Kensington &\nChelsea. The other borough in this area,Hammersmith\n& Fulham, will only accept the original certificate. If\nyou are worried about it being lost in the post then\nsend it Recorded Delivery.\n3. If you have not yet registered for Poll Tax in your\narea then send in your certificate with your\nregistration form.\nYour certificate is a valuable document and should be\nkept throughout your time at College. If, for any\nreason, it is lost you should contact the Registry\nwhere a replacement can be obtained.\nIn most cases the CCRO will accept your certificate\nalone as proof that you are a full-time student.\nAmount of Poll Tax payable by your\npartner/spouse\nUnless your partner/spouse can also be treated as a full-time student they will be liable for 100% of the\npersonal charge. However if they are not working or\nare on a low income they will be able to claim\nCommunity Charge Benefit. This will be claimed in a similar way to Housing Benefit. Local Authorities have\nset up separate Community Charge Benefit Sections\nfrom which claim forms can be obtained. Many people\nhave already been sent claim forms, if you think you\nmay qualify for benefit you should obtain a claim form\nas soon as possible. The maximum amount of\ncommunity charge benefit payable is 80% of the full\ncharge. For details of how the benefit is calculated see\n'Community Charge Benefit'.\nNB. Anyone who is a member of a married or\nunmarried couple will be jointly liable for their own and\ntheir partner's Poll Tax. So if your partner decides not\nto pay you can be pursued for their debt. This rule,\nhowever, does not apply to homosexual couples.\nParents are not responsible for their son's or\ndaughter's payments even if they are members of the\nsame household.\nCommunity Charge Benefit\nThe legislation does not allow full-time students to\nclaim community charge benefit to help with the 20%\nof the personal charge for which they are liable. But\nas we have already seen their partners/spouses will\nbe entitled.\nOverseas students and the poll tax\nAll overseas students aged 18 and over and their\npartners/spouses are liable to pay Poll Tax. An\noverseas visitor in this country for a short period\nwould not have to pay the charge. There is as yet still\nno definition of what constitutes a short visit although\nI have been advised that an overseas visitor in this\ncountry for less than three months would not have\nto pay Poll Tax.\nAll the legislation and administrative arrangements\nregarding the community charge apply in exactly the\nsame way to overseas students as they do to UK\nstudents. If you have recently arrived in the UK you\nwill need to register for Poll Tax and obtain a certificate-see sections 'Registration for Community\nCharge' and 'Certificates'.\nCommunity Charge Benefit is not classed as public\nfunds and therefore anyone from abroad liable to pay\nPoll Tax can claim this as long as they are not a full-time student. It therefore follows that if your spouse\nis not a full-time student, they will be eligible to apply\nfor community charge benefit.\nOnce you have completed your studies and returned\nhome your liability for poll tax will cease. You should\nsend your Poll Tax payment book together with an\nexplanatory note to your local community charge\noffice. However if you're only going home for a visit\nor travelling abroad on holiday you will still be liable\nfor Poll Tax during that time.\nChanges of circumstances\nAlthough the 'responsible person' at each address has\na duty to inform the CCRO of changes regarding\noccupants in their household there is also a legal\nrequirement for each individual Poll Tax payer to report\nrelevant changes in circumstance. The most likely\nchanges that you will need to report are:\n\u2022 Change of address\n\u2022 Ceasing to be a student\n\u2022 Leaving the UK\nYou should report the change in writing as you can\nkeep a copy of your letter in case of future queries.\nIf you are not sure whether to report or not, it is best\nto contact the CCRO first.\nOffices\nLB Hammersmith & Fulham\n8th Floor\nVencourt House,\n255 King Street, London W6 9JU Tel: Poll Tax Helpline 748 2404\nStudent Section: 748 3020 ext 1507\nRB Kensington & Chelsea\nTown Hall\nHornton Street, London W8\nTel: Freephone 0800 289772\nLB Westminster\nPO Box 250\nLondon SW1V 1TX( for correspondence)\nor\nChester Gate House\nVauxhall Bridge Road (for calls in person)\nLondon SW1\nTel: 537 2520/2421\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to the following, who provided information for\nthis article: Kensington & Chelsea, Hammersmith &\nFulham and Westminster Community Charge Offices;\nUCKOSA News Adviser's Briefing, February 1990;\nStudents and the Community Charge, Department of\nEnvironment Practice Note.\nSTOP PRESS Westminster Borough Council has announced\na Poll Tax of \u00a3 1 9 5 which amounts to \u00a3 3 9 per\nannum at the student rate of 2 0 % .\nMembers of a religious order are exempt from paring poll ta.x Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "Multiple Sclerosis\nresearch at IC\nMYELIN SHEATHS\nWHIZZ* ez zm zzz AXON\nOLIGODENDROCYTE\nAround one in a thousand people in the UK suffer from\nMultiple Sclerosis (MSI. It is a disease of the central\nnervous system prevalent in Europe, North America,\nAustralia and New Zealand, affecting young adults\nfrom 20 to 50 years of age. The reason for the\nconfinement of MS to these regions is as yet\nunknown. Although a virus has often been implicated,\nthe cause of MS is also a mystery.\nIn the healthy nervous system insulating fat rich\nsheaths of myelin wrap around the processes of nerve\ncells (axons). Electrical impulses jump along the nerve\nfrom one gap in this sheath to the next. Without this\ninsulating cover each axon would need to be a few\nmillimeters in diameter to carry its signal rapidly. The\nsquid, for example, has no myelin sheathing and has\na giant axon two millimetres in diameter, the largest\nin the animal kingdom.\nIn MS patients this myelin is stripped off, leaving\nlarge areas of bare axons. In the ab sense of myelin\nimpulses cannot reach their destination, resulting in\nsymptoms ranging from s past i city and paralysis to\nblindness and speech difficulties, depending on the\nsite of myelin loss. A characteristic feature of many\nMS cases is the relapsing/remitting course of the\ndisease. From the onset of the disease complete\nrecovery may occur during remissions which can last\nfor many years. As the disease progresses, patients\nmay be left with some permanent handicap after an\nattack and their condition may worsen as periods\nbetween relapses shortens.\nMyelin does recover to a certain extent during some\nstages of the disease. Lesions, or de myelinated areas,\nare thought to be in a constant state of flux,\nremy eli nation competing with demyelination. The\nreason for incomplete remy eli nation in MS is un kown. The cell type which produces myelin has been noted\nin increased numbers around the lesions of MS\npatients. This would suggest that the cells are there\nto re myelin ate the region but for some reason they\nPage 6\nare unable to.\nResearch underway in the Department of\nBiochemistry (South Kensington site) aims to discover\nwhy remy eli nation is not effective in MS. By studying\nthe development of the re myelin a ting cell in culture,\nwe hope to better understand the processes which\nallow them to produce myelin. It seems that these\n'oli god end ro cyte s' are capable of developing from\ntheir precursors to mature myelin a ting cells when\ncultured in the absence of neurone s. This indicates\nthat chemical signals from neurone s may not be\nnecessary to instruct these cells to begin to produce\nmyelin. A signal may be needed, however, to ensure\nsufficient and correct myelin production. We are at\npresent trying to find molecules which stimulate\noli god end ro cyte s to produce myelin which is capable\nof wrapping around nerve axons.\nIt may be the case that oli god end ro cyte s of MS\nsufferers can produce myelin but that for some reason\nit does not wrap around the axon. In healthy people\nnot all types of neurone become myelinated but it is\nnot clear how the oli god end ro cyte knows which types\nof axon to myelin ate and which types to leave\nunmyelinated. It may be that an axon which requires\nmyelin a ting will carry special molecules on its surface.\nBy comparing the effect on oli god end ro cyte s of\nneurone s which are not destined to become\nmyelinated and those which are, information may be\ngained as to the mechanisms and molecules involved\nin the wrapping of myelin around the nerve axon.\nIf any fault of the oli god end ro cyte s present in the\nMS lesions can be overcome by adding some growth\nfactor or other signal, then perhaps remy eli nation can\nbe persuaded to conquer over demyelination. Before\nthis is possible, however, much work must be done\nin order to better understand the myelin ation process,\nboth during development and in de myelin a ting diseases like Multiple Sclerosis.\nRebecca Hardy, Dept Biochemistry.\n\u2022 A computer system has been developed which\ncan construct a3D model of a landscape from two\nor more photographs. The system has been developed\njointly by UCL, Thorn-EMI, The Royal Signals Radar\nEstablishment and Lasercon (a map making\ncompany).\nTraditionally, such views have been made manually\nwhich was laborious and prone to human error. The\nnew technique is far quicker and more versatile. The\nfilm produced by NASA's Jet Propulsion laboratory\nshowing the surface of the Uranian moon, Miranda,\ntook several months to make and used equipment\ncosting $ % million. It is claimed that the new a para tus could have done this for $10,000 in several days.\nA project involving NASA and the Soviet Academy\nof Science will use such software to build up a topographic map of Siberian volcanoes, without the\nregion having to be visited. Less than 40% of the\nEarth's surface is adequately mapped; with this\napproach it could be done within a decade.\nThere are many other uses such as aircraft\nsimulators with real landscapes and robot vision for\nquality control.\n\u2022 The 'Searching for Extra-Terrestrial\nIntelligence' (SETI) project has been approved by\nNASA. The $100 million programme, planned over ten\nyears, will hunt the electromagnetic spectrum\nbetween 1 and 10GHz(10910 lo Hz) for signs of\nalien activity. It will revolve around a new radio\nreceiver, to be built in California, which is reported to\nbe capable of scanning 14 million channels\nsimultaneously. This is the largest such scheme so far\nand compares to a budget of one to two million dollars\na year during the eighties. The move follows a survey\nwhich calculated that 80-90% of ordinary Americans\nbelieve that alien life exists, mainly on our\nneighbouring planet, Mars.\n\u2022 The cost of altering computer software for the\nyear 2000 could be billions of pounds. Much of\ntoday's business software still uses a six figure\nnumber for dates with no provision for years after the\nturn of the century. The biggest bills are likely to be\nincurred by the banks and insurance firms. One major\ncompany recently modified its pension system at an\nexpense of \u00a3120,000. Each charged line of code\ncosts 10 times as much to alter as it did to write in\nthe first place.\n\u2022 The British have now joined two international\nteams competing to produce the first cost-effective\nsolid fuel cells. These cells, which may well prove to\nbe the power source of the future, utilise a fuel such\nas natural gas and an oxidising agent, making a highly\nefficient, silent-running power supply with almost no\nnoxious gas emission.\nThe two projects are funded by the European\nCommission as part of the JOULE (Joint Opportunities\nfor Unconventional Longterm Energy supply) initiative.\nIt is hoped that by 1992 an economical 1kW solid\noxide fuel cell will have been developed with the\ncapability to be scaled up to a200 kW unit sufficient\nfor a small industrial electricity supply.\nPlug: Roger Penrose, the distinguished author of 'The\nEmporer's New Mind' is giving a talk entitled\n'Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of\nPhysics'. This will take place in Huxley 213 on\nWednesday 21 February at 1.15pm. "

    "content": "More\nAfroc reply\nDear Dave,\nIn response to the slanderous comments made\nagainst Afro-Caribbean Society in last week's FELIX,\nI would like to comment the following:\nAfro-Caribbean Society does not support the\ndistribution, sale or use of drugs and is in no way\ninvolved in that business. The association made by\nFELIX in the What's On column is very unfair to all\nmembers of the Society. It must be said that it simply\nis a lie and, a very bad joke.\nIn your editorial, you are keen to put all the troubles\nof the past week under one heading: 'Afro-Caribbean\nDisco', instead of 'Violence' or any other alternative.\nDo you think you are contributing positively to the\natmosphere at IC? Let me tell you the answer: no, you\nare not.\nYour further comments accusing Afro-Caribbean\nSociety as the source of all trouble are also unjust.\nThe problem that we are faced by is the drug\nsuppliers of London looking for new markets: this time\nthey have chosen IC as their target. The party held\non February 2 this year was the second time that\ndrugs appeared at an IC party. This is a bad\ndevelopment: we don't want drugs at IC and IC should\nnot lose its reputation for being clean (forget about\nthe alcohol for a moment).\nConcerning the security at the Afro-Caribbean\nSociety's event: no one had ever expected this sort\nof junk to turn up. Never, in previous years, has there\nbeen a need for such high security measures and AfroCaribbean Society cannot solely be blamed for the\nensuing messes. It must be taken as a warning to all\nsocieties to take preventive measures.\nI hope this clears up any damned prejudices last\nweek's FELIX may have imprinted in any reader's mind.\nYours,\nWouter van Hulten, ICU Overseas Students Officer.\nP.S. Are you coming to the International Night\ntonight?\nIs it live\nor digital?\nDear FELIX,\nI recently attended a concert in the Royal Festival\nHall costing \u00a310.\nImagine my grief when I discovered that the concert\nwas not digital, and could have considerably\nbenefitted from a stereo image (or even mega bass).I feel that students should be told that a cd sounds\nmore realistic-due to digital sound quality and\nleft/right stereo images.\nYours,\nBrian Ollocks, Acoustic Eng Post Grad.\nP.S, Perhaps ICSO should consider incorporating\nDolby noise reduction in their future presentations?\nStill a con And there's more\nDear Dave,\nRE: FELIX letter, 9.2.90\nIt's nice to know that J Tennant-Smith has not seen\nthe downside of life at IC and I hope he never does.\nBut the overwhelming probability is that he will. And\nhe ought to recognise that the sense of loss and\nmisery that ensues does not come from within. It is\nnot attributable to any one defect of his personal\nlife-it is the environment that he is surrounded by.\nThis affects people in many unpredictable ways, but\nthe one common denominator in the College it seems\nto me is the attitude of our tutors, professors and in\nparticular the Administration. When you are required\n. to work your socks off for eight hours a day, enduring\nthe most terminally un enlightening lectures only to\nread in FELIX that the authorities are tightening the\nstudents' belts even further-it is inevitably going to\naffect your resolve. A reminder: during the time I have\nbeen here I have seen rents rise an average of 20%\nper annum; I have seen an attempt to remove the JCR\nfrom Union jurisdiction; I have read about the Housing\nManager's comments that 'Students have no rights\nto accommodation during the holidays'; I have seen\nthe College attempt to cut back the Careers Service.\nThis is wrong. It is no longer a question of belt-tightening now. The problem has been around too long\nfor anyone but Professor Eric Ash to be responsible\nfor the ailment this College is suffering. I am warning\nhim now-the issue is starting to affect people's lives.\nAuthor of 'Imperial is a Con'.\nName withheld at Editor's discretion.\nMr Zeebub\nreplies\nDear Mr Smedley,\nThank you for your burnt offering (RE: FELIX 858,\nMr Two slices short of a house brick), but your\ncontract with Him clearly states the requirement of\nthree virgins (female, and that's the tricky bit around\nhere) and your soul. Perhaps you should contact J Tennant-Smith as far as virgins go; apparently he has\na monopoly on overseas imports. Your soul we took\na while ago, as I believe your editorials show.\nI wrote to express the Prince's concern at your\ndecision to ban all our publicity. These Christian\nfellows must be allowed to air their funny views\n(clause 2.8 in Mr Kirk's Presidency contract requires\nit I believe) otherwise people might get it into their\nhead that God is a well with-it guy. Let's face it,\nChristianity is no longer good business for us down\nhere. Gone are the days of crusades, burning witches,\norgies in the Vatican and Popes fighting each other.\nTo this end I have here a few words which might\nhelp Mr Saradakis in his next letter; fornication, incest,\nlesbianism, concubinage, whore dom, seraglio, gentile,\ngenital, satanism. Nothing like getting it out into the\nopen is there, after all, Jesus was the right hand of\nGod.\nHope to see you soon.\nBL Zeebub, Lord of all things pointy, Physics I. Dear Editor,\nAs members of the Afro-Caribbean Society, we feel\nthat we should give our reaction to the appa ling defamation of our society name, made by three\narticles in last week's FELIX.\nWe feel that it was unfortunate that one or two\nmuggings took place outside the JCR, regret ably well\nout of site of the vigilant external security, which we,\nAfro-Caribbean Society thoughtfully implemented on\nthe night. However, it is in no way the Society's responsibility to enforce the laws of the land, in and\naround the College ground. Furthermore, we resent\nand object to any portioning of blame to the Society,\nsince it is entirely and only a police matter.\nMoreover, the petty robberies which took place\ninside the JCR during the event, were the result of\nindividual stupidity and lack of basic commonsense,\nas the Afro-Caribbean Society had conscientiously\nprovided for personal belongings to be looked after.\nHowever, a handfull of people did not take advantage\nof this facility and, as a result paid, the consequences.\nTherefore, the Afro-Caribbean Society cannot accept\nany responsibility for the loss of personal belongings,\nhowever much we sym pathis e. As Society members, we feel greatly insulted, hurt\nand saddened by the misrepresentation of the facts\nof what happened at that event, which FELIX\ncontained last week.

    "content": "A Guy Called Gerald\nRenegade Soundwave\n-Probablv a Robbery 12\"\nAfter hearing everyone and their cousin rave about\nhow on the seventh day God created Manchester, we\nfinally had the opportunity to see what it was all\nabout. A Guy Called Gerald, the McDonalds maestro\nwho rose to semi-stardom on the shoulders of singles\nVoodoo Ray, FX and Eyes of Sorrow was set to play\nlive to a packed and sold out venue. On our arrival we\nwere immediately struck by the extreme stickiness of\nthe floor; in fact while not dodging stray airborne cans\nof Red Stripe we experienced the sensation of dancing\non flypaper. The venue itself was totally unsuitable\nfor Gerald's music, it was a university hall and, despite\nthe effects, it looked and felt like one. There was\nabsolutely no atmosphere.\nSoon our attention was focused on the stage and\nthe emergence of a long haired 70s leftover pounding\nhis drums to the sound of Culture House. He was\njoined by the less-than-lethal Rap Assassins complete\nThe Mission\n-Carved in Sand LP\nEven the cover shows a change of image for The Mish\nas they experiment with new styles to embrace a wider audience. Tracks range from what we expect\nfrom The Mission to Butterfly on a Wheel (which\nreached number ten in the Network Charts! to simple\nballads.\nThe album begins with Amelia, a song against child\nabuse. Wayne Hussey's voice sounds strained and\nharsh as he takes the part of the abuser. Into the Blue\ngives us what the Missionaries have come to know\nand love, as do Deliverance and Belief\u2014anthems\nwhich, as the titles suggest, conjure up memories of\nthe Reading Festival where fans from around the\ncountry raised their voices with one accord to chant\n'Give me deliverance'. Ahh-s tiring, isn't it?\nHowever, there are surprises, as with Sea of Love.\nWhat's this? The Mission gone to India? It's definitely\ndifferent, as are the country pasture backing sounds\nto Lovely. That's just Wayne daydreaming about\npast ural pleasantries and folklore on an acoustic\nguitar, sitting in a meadow with a flautist.\nEach song is memorable in its own way a step up\nand away from their previous albums and a tribute to\nThe Mission and producer Tim Palmer. There is\nsomething to please everyone without making\ncompromises for it. Mission fans will love it, and\nthey'll probably convert quite a few more.\nSJH.\n-ULU 9.2.90\nwith pretend scratching and na ff dance steps. After\na brief intermission provided by Mike Pickering (of\n'Hacienda' fame) and his unoriginal orbital anthems\nwe were finally graced with Gerald's presence.\nHe promptly kicked into an uninspiring set, receiving\nthe best response with singles FX, Eyes of Sorror and\nnew single Automatic. Ironically Gerald received the\nbest response for his cover of 808 State.\nRumoured to be amongst the audience were Mark\nMoore of S 'Express and some sc allie who claimed to\nbe from The Happy Mondays: they are probably still\nstuck to the ULU floor.\nWhile Gerald is a likeable character, he failed to\nshiver our timbers and I'd assume many people went\nhome feeling somewhat shortchanged.\nMore hype than Batman and Gerald sucks-Adam & Dan.\nDepeche Mode\n\u2014Enjoy the Silence 12\"\nDepeche Mode's later work has not received the\nsuccess it perhaps deserves; while they are huge on\nthe Continent and vast in the USA (the 12\" of\nPersonal Jesus was Warner's best-selling single of\n1989 and outstripped both Prince and Madonna for\nthis placing) they have never repeated their early Top\nTen hits.\nThis single may or may not change that; like all their\nrecent singles it looks worthy of a high chart showing\nbut like them it may not get it. Musically it marks yet\nanother change in direction, this time to a very simple\nmelody but an immensely addictive one, layered with\nsound to create an aural collage. The packaging is no\nsurprise-a, by now, traditional Corbijn sleeve and a battery of nothing-like-the-original remixes.\nMaybe not a massive hit but a great single anyway.\nPromises good things for the forthcoming hit Violater.\nAC Marias\n\u2014One of our Girls has gone Missing 12\"\nThis record gives the impression of having been\ncrafted from air and spider web, very much where the\nCocteau Twins could have been today if they'd liked\nlyrics more. Rather the sort of thing you listen to when\nyou don't know what else to listen to, but an intense\nexperience none the less. The B side is a rather\nwonderful ve rion of Lou Reed's Vicious.\nStone.\nRenegade Soundwave serve up possibly the most\nridiculous vocal hook so far this year-Probably A Robbery..A Bit of Skulduggery but it fits in this heavy\nbass tune with startling grace. This one should be a monster in the clubs and shows signs of charting. The\ntwo 12\"s offer you the option of with or without\nvocal; in addition last year's flop but this year's essential Ozone Breakdown, previously available only\non import, appears on the limited 12\".\nNitzer Ebb\n\u2014Lightning Man 12\"\nThe new single by Nitzer Ebb comes as rather a shock.\nAfter the violent electronic barrage of their earlier\nwork (with a few brief respites on the Belief album)\nthis single breaks new ground in adding a tune to the\ndynamism in the form of frighteningly funky horns and\ncatchy riffs. This is not a development I had expected,\nbut it does nothing to dampen the energy packed into\nthe song. It almost bursts out at you.\nIt comes on 'analogue 12\" and digital 3\"'. The\nremix 12\" is a lot better than the normal one.\nDELS HORNY GIG GUIDE\nFRIDAY 16th FEB\nThey Might be Giants + Trashcan\nSinatras ULU\nSUNDAY 18th FEB\nFelo-De-Se +\nThe Meerkats London Marquee\nMONDAY 19th FEB\nCut Cut Emma +\nWell Loaded Kennington Cricketers\nTUESDAY 20th FEB\nThe Mission Kilburn National\nUS-UK Camden Palace\nWEDNESDAY 21st FEB\nThe Screaming\nTrees Fulham Greyhound\nWe Are Going to Eat You Marquee\nTHURS 22nd FEB\nHorny Gig of the Week:\nThe Telescopes + Kitchens of\nDistinction + New Fast Automatic\n+ Daffodils + The\nChairs All at ULU\nPage 5\n\n"

    "content": "Clare Davis describes the Government's new road improvement scheme and its effect on homes and the\nenvironment.\nRoads to nowhere\nIt seems as though no part of London will be safe from\nMr Parkinson's newest baby-the Red Routes road\n'improvement' scheme.\nSpeaking at a recent Envirosoc lecture, John\nStewart from Capital Transport Campaign described\nwhy the scheme will do nothing to tackle congestion\nin London.\nThe tactics of the Transport Minister have been odd\nto say the least. His Commons speech on the issue\nmainly dealt with minor plans for Public Transport,\nwith the scheme's true scale and impact being played\ndown. Equally confusing is the booklet detailing the\nplans, produced by Sir William Halcrow, amongst\nothers. This attempt at glossing over the issue is\nhardly surprising, however, when what is really being\nproposed is the most massive road building scheme\nsince the Second World War.\nFacts given by Mr Parkinson are that spending on\nroad construction will be up by 40% next year and\nover the next three years a total of around \u00a312 billion\nis to be spent on roads locally and nationally.\nFor London the scale of the plans is frightening. The\nmajor schemes include widening the south circular\nbetween Kew and Clapham or a tunnel link between\nChiswick and Wandsworth; the amusingly named\nWestern Environmental Improvement Road (WEIR)\nfrom Shepherds Bush to Wandsworth; major\ndemolition of property between Clapham and Eltham\nto widen the existing South Circular, and more\ndemolition between Kings Cross and Aldgate to name\nbut a few of the potentially affected areas.\nEffects on local communities will be far reaching.\nA foretaste of what is to come for people as far apart\nas Chiswick and Kings Cross is the present situation\nin Leytonstone. Hundreds of people here may lose\ntheir homes in the construction of the new M11 link\nfrom Wanstead to Hackney Wick, but the public\ninquiry may only be given three weeks.\nThe road plans, of which the Red Routes scheme\nis just a part, have followed a consultation period of\njust two months. They seem out of date at a time\nwhen our European competitors, ie France and\nGermany, have realised that the more roads you build\nthe more traffic jams result, as people who previously\nwould have left their cars at home for the journey to\nwork, now race to clog up the latest A road or\nmotorway.\nA recent Gallup survey shows that 82% of\nLondoners favour some kind of traffic restraint\nmeasures and 79% of drivers feel the same. So why,\nin the light of all this unpopularity is the roads option\nbeing pushed so hard? Two of the most probable\ndriving forces behind the decision are the Roads Lobby\nand 1992. Hardly a week goes by without MPs\nreceiving mail from bodies with an interest in road\ntransport. They are undoubtedly a very powerful\ncampaigning force, including not only construction\ncompanies but motor manufacturers, road freight\nservices, the AA and RAC etc. The approach of 1992\nhas sparked many rows over freight and passenger\ntransport links with Europe, but all of them whether\nrail or road, will require fast passage across London.\nCapital Transport Campaign believe that London is to\nbe boxed in by 'fast' roads in preparation for this. If\nthis is true then the Government's logic must be\nquestioned because roads are the most expensive\noption Mr Parkinson could have chosen; the estimated\ncost of building a new road in London is about \u00a340\nmillion per mile.\nFor the local communities of South London a much\nbetter alternative would be to reinstate the myriad of\ndisused rail lines in existence South of the river which\ncould be done at a fraction of the cost of the South\nCircular 'improvements'. However forty years of\nd is investment has left British Rail and London Regional\nTransport unwilling to take imaginative risks such as\nthese, especially when proposals for desperately\nneeded, major cross-London rail links are brushed\naside in favour of Mr Parkinson's expensive, polluting\nbrain-child.\nSo, apart from the orbital rail links already\nmentioned, what does the Capital Transport\nCampaign propose instead? To coin ac liche, there are\nfour 'green' ways to travel; walking, cycling, bus and\ntrain. Walking is the universal mode of transport and\ncycling is nothing new to most students and plenty\nof commuters too, but at the moment it is either\nfrustrating, hair-raising, or both.\nIt goes without saying that more cycle lanes are\nneeded, but the problem is such items such as cycle\nlanes, widening pavements, improving junctions for\npedestrians and planting trees etc is the responsibility\nof the local councils. No extra cash is made available\nafter a spree of road building, so the councils rarely\nprovide these 'traffic calming' measures.\nA better bus service could help immensely. In 1960\n46% of Londoners travelled to work by bus compared\nwith 15% today. Most bus routes haven't changed\nsince the 1960's and are very much out of date in\ntoday's city. A comprehensive system of bus lanes\n(possible as most buses travel on wide roads), and a system by which buses could change traffic lights to\ngreen as they approach them, have also been\nsuggested.\nMore controversial ideas have tackled clamping and\ncompany cars. Around 80% of rush hour traffic is\nmade up of company cars. CTC believe companies\nshould be encouraged to buy travel season tickets\ninstead, but of course this suggestion has not proved\npopular as it does not provide freedom of travel for\nfamilies at weekends.\nIt is obvious that something has to be done soon\nto ease the traffic chaos in London. The Utopian postwar dream of every adult in the country owning a car\ncan never happen. We have to change our ideas about\nhow often we use a car, not necessarily give them\nup, but first we need a reliable alternative-spending\nbillions on roads won't solve anything except, perhaps\nto line the pockets of big investors.\nIf you want to do something positive then give up\nfive minutes of your time on Thursday 22 February\n(at the Caterpillar Cafe) or Friday 23 (JCR) to sign a letter, or write your own.

    "content": "Neil's not happy\nabout Harlington\nBelated Valentine's greeting to everyone. Hope\neveryone had a good time on Wednesday night.\nAccommodation and Harlington Gravel Monies\nYou may wonder why I 've put these two issues\ntogether. Last week a letter landed on my desk stating\nthat St Mary's were involved in a deal involving their\ntennis courts which could result in them having Vh\nmillion surplus to allocate. Reportedly the students of\nSt Mary's are willing to donate this to the St\nMary's/ Imperial Merger Appeal if students of IC\ndonate a comparable sum. Sir Eric Ash has suggested\n\u00a3 % million would be appropriate and that the money\nshould come from the gravel extraction down at\nHarlington. Many of you will not know the history of\nHarlington, a feature article on Harlington in next\nweek's FELIX will, however, explain all.\nFirstly, I have yet to find out whether it was actually\nthe students at St Mary's who requested this or\nwhether that was a story concocted by the Rector as\nan attempted emotional blackmail. Secondly, I think\nit is wrong of the Rector to try and use monies to buy\na residence when it is the athletics facilities that are\nsuffering as a result. As a trustee of the Harlington\nGravel money I will be dead set against buying a new\nhall of residence with the monies on a number of\ngrounds:\n1. The extraction of the gravel has seriously reduced\nthe athletics facilities at Harlington and will do so until\nthe extraction is finished (another two years).\n2. The extraction of the gravel has deteriorated the\nquality of the playing surfaces at Harlington.\n3. Imperial College is severely under-resourced\nwhen it comes to sports and athletics facilities.\n4. Imperial College does not maintain its present\nstock of housing adequately enough already. What\nhope has it with increased stocks?\n5. Is it a hall of residence the students want? First\nyears may want halls of residence, it is more likely that\nsecond, third, fourth year undergraduates and\npostgraduates would prefer either assistance with\ntheir housing costs or cheaper facilities/services at\nCollege so that they can afford the private housing.\nAlternative Prospectus (AP)\nAs Dave Smedley said in last week's FELIX we are\nhoping to compile and distribute this over Easter. A number of enquiries from prospective students have\nincluded requests for details on living costs in London.\nThe full Alternative Prospectus of last year\nconcentrated on departments, the AP update will\nconcentrate on services and living costs. Anybody\nwishing to comment on any issue such as\naccommodation, nightlife, welfare services, refectory\nservices, athletics facilities, etc please write to myself\nor David Smedley. All contributions will be kept\nanonymous. I hope the Rector gets his act together\nand decides the rents for the halls as these will be one\npart of the AP update.\nTransport\nThe deadline for Easter vacation van applications is\nFriday 23 Feb 1990. Please get them in on time\nespecially those who wish to go abroad.\nExternal Affairs\nLoans: The loans bill will have come up for discussion\nyesterday. I will not have attended the NUS march but\nI will have been to the House of Commons to listen\nto the debate. More next week.\nPoll Tax: Watch out for feature articles in FELIX on\nthe Poll Tax. This week facts and figures, next week\n'why to evade it and how to evade it'. This is coupled\nwith a two day campaign next Thursday and Friday\nin the JCR. 11.30am to 2.00pm. Union General Meetings\nThere will be an EGM on Thursday 22 February, at\n1pm in the JCR to discuss ICU transport subsidy\npolicy.\nRag Week II\nFollowing on with the 'if it's a good idea do it again'\ntheory, the next two biggest Rag events are the\nHypnosis Lecture tonight and Monopoly all around\nLondon tomorrow. Doors will open at 7.00pm tonight\nfor the Hypnosis Lecture which will be Martin Taylor's fascinating combination of talk and demonstration on\nhypnotism-an evening's entertainment for only\n\u00a32.50 so not to be missed.\nRag are very happy to present a day of fun and\nhilarity absolutely FREE we will be playing Monopoly\nall over London, in teams of 4-6, fancy dress is almost\nessential if you want to stand a chance of winning\nsome of the fabulously alcoholic prizes on offer.\nMonopoly wil be in aid of the British Institute for Brain\nInjured Children which is one of our chosen charities\nthis year.\nHon Sec\nSabbatical Elections\nPapers are now up for sabbatical elections; President,\nDeputy President, FELIX Editor and Honorary\nSecretary (Events).

    "content": "Bent\nWhat are the origins of the Pink Triangle? Or for that\nmatter, what are the origins of the Yellow Star, Green\nTriangle (criminals) and Red Triangle (communists)?\nThe revival of Martin Sherman's celebrated play Bent,\nten years after its premiere (ironically on the day\nMargaret Thatcher took office), re-addresses issues\njust as poignant whether one is talking about modern\nday Britain or Hitler's Germany.\nThe hero of the piece, Max (Ian McKellen) is quite\nthe bon vive ur. He and his cabaret dancer friend Rudy\nlive peaceably in a thirties Berlin reminiscent of\nMarlene Dietrich. With the advent of Naziism they are\nostr aci sed by so-called friends and, unable to flee the\ncountry, are forced to go into hiding. In a flash they\nare arrested and sent to Dachau. In the second act,\nwithout Rudy, Max, in refusing to accept\nresponsibility for his sexuality, pretends to be Jewish\nrather than homosexual so wears a yellow star and\nnot a pink triangle. This is for the very good reason;\nin death camps such as Dacau, the homosexuals are\ntreated even worse than the Jews, believe it or not.\nSo, Max gets the meat and vegetables from the prison\nsoup whilst Horst (Michael Cashman-Eastenders'\nColin), another homosexual, just gets the water\nskimmed off the top.\nInmates are compelled to needlessly carry rocks\nfrom one site to another and then back again; for\ntwelve hours a day. Of course the Nazis, by treating\ntheir prisoners like animals, were trying to deprive\nthem of their humanity and self-respect. So that they\nwould die wretchedly with no sense of self. For\nexample, when one man takes his own life, a final act\nexpressing defiance and freedom, the whole of his\nbarrack is forced to stand on parade all night as\npunishment. Despite this Max manages to maintain\nhis self respect. After twelve hours of intense physical\neffort moving rocks he still does press-ups at night,\nthereby reasserting his freedom. Horst remarks that\nhe has a nice body and Max ironically retorts 'Well I take care of it, I exercise'.\nMax and Horst, over the course of a year's hard\nlabour together, develop a loving relationship. But as\nthey are never allowed to touch or even look at each\nother the relationship can only ever be spiritual. They\nTheatre\ncan only make love to each other in their imaginations.\nThe much talked about 'faked orgasm scene' from\nWhen Harry Met Sally is made to look like a far fetched\nAmerican Soap Opera in comparison. Through this\nMax teaches Horst a sense of defiant self-respect and\nMax learns he must take full responsibility for his\nsexuality. So, in its attempt to break them, Nazi\nGermany paradoxically strengthens them. You could,\nif you wanted to, make the connection with Clause\n28 and Thatcher's Britain or with any other forms of\noppression for that matter.\nThe script, however, is not all 'doom and gloom'\nand there are many superb one-liners, never detracting\nfrom the power of the piece. The acting is first rate,\nIan McKellen in particular is excellent. We cannot\nrecommend this production too strongly.\nYet one cannot help thinking that the emotion and\nsentiment of the production has not been pitched as\nhigh as it could have been. Remember that the\nNational Theatre is a Sfafe sub sidi sed theatre and also\nthat the general aim of Clause 28 is to prevent State\n'promotion of homosexuality'. So has this production\nbeen a victim of oppression as well? Perhaps.\nThe following article from the New York Times (3\nDecember 1989) was included in the programme:\nBartow, Florida, December 2nd: The American Civil\nLiberties Union is opposing a County Sheriff's policy\nthat forces homosexual prisoners to wear pink\nbracelets. For 15 years homosexuals at a jail in Polk\nCounty in central Florida have been segregated and\nworn pink wristbands. 'All hell would break loose if\nhomosexuals were allowed to mix with the general\npopulation,' said Sheriff Lawrence Crow Jr.\nA Sheriff's Spokeswoman said there was no special\nreason for pink. 'It's really an off-red,' she said.\nBent is currently playing at the National Theatre,\nLyttleton to full houses.\nAdrian Pagan and Anna Teeman.\nTheatre\nA Vision of Love Revealed in Sleep\nA man, naked save for a piece of cloth draped around\nhim, stands in the middle of the stage. He tells us of\nMr Simeon Solomon, a painter, a Jew and a homosexual. He then unfolds for us the tale of\nSolomon's life and death in the late 19th and early\n20th century. Interspersed with extracts from\nSolomon's prose poem 'A Vision of Love Revealed in\nSleep', and other original sections, composed by the\nauthor and main performer Neil Bartlett, he and three\nothers (Betty 'Bloolips' Bourne, Regina Fong and Robin\nWhitmore) explore the themes of homosexuality,\nrespect abl it y and love.\nThe performance is very much one of sections, each\nsection almost complete in itself and varying from its\nneighbours in style and tone, but all developing the\nbasic thrust of the play.\nThere are moments of comedy-a pastiche of a tour\naround the National Gallery, ridiculing British attitudes\nto foreigners and hypocrisy with regard to art, being\na good example, and there are moments of high camp;\n'It's frock-time, girls!'.\nCertain sections are extremely chilling-the tale of\na gay man walking home through London, suffering\nabuse from people and graf it ti about AIDS, and then\nreturning home to phone friends-and finding them\ndrying of that very disease-is especially frightening.\nIt could be easy for a heterosexual to sym pathis e with\nthis, but then dismiss it as a 'gay problem', but it only\ntakes a second thought to remind oneself that AIDS\nis a threat to all of us, and anyone could soon be\nplaying out the scene in real life.\nIt's not all good though -certain sections of the play\nare somewhat tedious and have aten dancy to drag,\nand the whole production seems a little overlong-but this does not detract greatly from its overall effect.\nThe set is minimal-the backdrop is a huge\nreproduction of a Simeon Solomon painting. On the\nstage itself there are four boxes which act as storage\nareas for the props that are used, and which perform\na variety of other functions throughout the show.\nLighting is used cleverly, and to good effect, as is the\nmusic; composed, adapted, arranged and performed\nby Nicholas Bloomfield.\nA beautiful, moving piece about the nature of love,\ntold from a homosexual standpoint.\nA Vision of Love Revealed in Sleep (Part 3) is playing\nat the Drill Hall Arts Centre, Chienes Street, WC1E\nuntil 24 February. The nearest tube is Goodge Street\nand a concessionary ticket costs \u00a34. Phone the box\noffice on 637 8270.\nAdam T. "

    "content": "\u00a32\nA million lost by sports clubs as Astroturf plans fail\nStudents turfed out\nImperial College students may lose out to\nthe tune of \u00a3 % million if a proposal from\nthe Rector, Sir Eric Ash, goes ahead. The\nmoney would be taken from the\nHarlington Gravel Trust Fund and would\nfinance a new hall of residence. The\nproposal may also break the terms under\nwhich the trust has been set up.\nSir Eric hopes to match a proposed\ndonation by St Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool (SMHMS) of Vh million towards\nthe Imperial College/St Mary's Merger\nAppeal which was created to raise money\nfor new student accommodation. The St\nMary's donation is likely to be financed\nby the sale of some land at their sports\ngrounds in Teddington.\nSir Eric made his proposal in a letter to\nUnion President Neil McCluskey, who is\none of the trustees of the Harlington Fund.\nThe letter was copied to Harry Knutton,\na College Governor and Chairman of the\nCollege Athletics committee, who is\nchairman of the Harlington Trustees. The\nthird trustee, Steven Goulder, an ex-ICU\nPresident, was not aware of the proposal\nuntil contacted by Mr McCluskey.\nMr McCluskey said that the trustees of\nthe Harlington Fund had agreed in\nDecember that the fund should be spent\nto 'finance new or improved sporting\nfacilities'. These guidelines are being put\nto the College Finance and Executive\nCommittee, which takes decisions on\nmajor College expenditure, today. Mr\nMcCluskey said that he had heard that\nconcern had been voiced by some of the\nsenior College administration that these\nterms of reference were too narrow. He\nis trying to organise a meeting of the\ntrustees to discuss the issue as soon as\npossible. He said that his view was that\nmoney from the fund 'should only be spent\non non-athletics projects when the athletics\nfacilities were up to standard'.\nMr Knutton said that he was not going\nto decide anything until he had met the\nother trustees. He said that he felt the\nmoney should be 'devoted to capital\nprojects for the benefit of students' and\nthat this should be primarily sporting and\nathletics facilities.\nMr Goulder said that he saw 'no\nproblem with making access to the fund\nwider than athletics and sports, for\nexample bursa ries for overseas travel' but\nadded that he felt 'the Trust is there to\nestablish a fund for student amenities and\nit is not in our interest to use it for capital\ndevelopment more suited to other methods\nof funding'.\nMr Goulder said he was 'disappointed\nthat the Rector hasn't felt able to discuss\nthe matter with the trustees before making\nthe decision'. He said that the Rector was\n'undermining the nature of the trustees'.\nHe added that he was worried that College\nwould 'get into thinking that this is a windfall and they can use it to bale them\nout of short term difficulties'.\nAngus Fraser, College's Managing\nDirector, claimed that the proposal to use\nfunds from the Harlington Trust was 'put\nforward on the basis that the funds are\nintended to be used for the benefit of\nstudents'. He said that the terms of the\nTrust had been interpreted in the past by\nGoverning Body, the College's highest\ndecision making commit ee, as including\naccommodation as well as sporting\nfacilities.\nHe said he was aware of the\nrecommendations of the trustees, but he\nfelt that they implied a change from the\noriginal understanding by Governing Body\nof the Trust's purpose and were 'more\nfocused and restricted'. He insisted that\nit was important to clarify the original\nunderstanding so that Governing Body\nwould be in a position to endorse or\ndiscard the recommendations of the\ntrustees.\nThe Rector was unavailable for\ncomment. His letter to Mr McCluskey and\nMr Knutton indicates that the donation\nfrom St Mary's was proposed by the Dean\nof St Mary's, Professor Peter Richards,\nwho was also unavailable for comment.\nRhydian Hapgood, the SMHMS Union\nPresident, said that although the students\nhad no control of the money, the Union\nfelt that if the money 'was coming out of\nTeddington, it ought to go back into sports\nfacilities at Teddington'.\nHe said that Professor Richards had\ndiscussed the proposal with the St Mary's Union Executive and that they were 'not\naverse to the money going towards\nresidences', but that 'IC has not got\nenough money to support the residences\nit's got'. He said that it was 'pointless\nputting the money into accommodation if\nit's going to make the problem worse'.\nA row has also broken out over the\nAstroturf pitch which was to be built at\nHarlington. The pitch may not be ready\nbefore the start of next year's hockey\nseason. The ICU Hockey Club, who have\nbeen playing on hired Astroturf whilst the\nHarlington Ground is under excavation,\nwill be left without any home pitches \"for\nnext season.\nThe scheme has been delayed because\nsome of the senior College administration\nfeel that the quotes obtained for laying the\npitch are too high. Angus Fraser, College\nManaging Director, said that 'the\nproposed solution as put forward is\nconsiderably more expensive than\noriginally estimated'.\"He said that the\nproposal was not going to be taken to\ntoday's Finance and Executive (F&E) meeting as originally intended because he\nfelt that F&E should be able to 'endorse\nit with full confidence that the money is\nbeing spent in the best possible way' and\nthat this was not possible until 'some\npoints were clarified*.\nBenjamin Turner, ICU Athletics Clubs\nCommittee Chairman, said that 'it's important we don't allow the Astroturf to\nfall so far behind schedule that we do not\nhave a pitch available for next season'. He\nsaid that the Hockey Club would have\nsevere difficulties finding pitches for next\nyear at this stage.\ncontinued on back page\n\n"

    "content": "Dance in Florida\nImperial College Dance Club's trip to Florida in January\nwas great fun. About twenty universities were\ncompeting, some British, but mostly American. Teams\nof four couples were required. Since we,only had\nseven, Oxford kindly lent us one of their worst couples\nwho consistently failed to get past the first rounds.\nNevertheless, Imperial College waltzed away with 56\nout of a maximum of 120 possible trophies (these\nwere awarded for 1st,2 nd, and 3rd places only).\nOne of the American universities had many couples,\nall with the same routines and amused us by swapping\npartners for different competitions. It was just as well\nthat our coach Victoria Conniffe had taken the trouble\nto tailor our routines to each individual couple because\nit would have been really embarrassing for the 6th couple to do an unknown formation dance when we\nhad five out of six couples in one Jive final.\nIt must be conceded that Brigham Young university\nwere notable for their absence. Some of their students\ndo degrees in dance. Their reputation as relayed to us\nby Oxford coach at Heathrow airport had caused\nsome alarm, but after the first competition which\nOxford surprisingly won, we discovered that Brigham\nYoung were not in fact present. Following this dirty\ntrick from Oxford, Imperial rapidly regained composure\nand came top in all subsequent team competitions.\nNext time, friendly advice from Oxford will be treated\nwith the disdain it deserves.\nSome of us believe that Cambridge's mysterious\nabsence was also due to Oxfords desire to win, but\nsome of us do not rate Oxford so highly. Since\nCambridge's coach was in fact spotted in Florida, the\ndiscerning reader might deduce that Cambridge\nneeded a touch of Vicky's choreography.\n(Cambrdige's inadequacy was amply demonstrated in\nSheffield last weekend when Imperial slaughtered\nthem 46 points to 45 in the first team competitions\nof this year.)\nThe programme laid on for us was exhausting, but\nfor those of us who have a fetish for pancakes\ndrowned in maple syrup their generous supply at\nbreakfast times made the whole trip worthwhile.\nIt is two years before the Americans are likely to\nbe holding this event again. It is obviously an\nadvantage to have a left foot and a right foot, but\nVicky has the ability to get beginners into the winning\nstreak and so you too could find yourself dancing\naway to Florida (some of the Imperial team couples\nwere beginners in October).\nIf our lifestyle appeals to you (going to America\nduring term-time enjoying sub sidi sed travel, and\nGood value\nChampagne\nThis Tuesday's tasting was even more romantic than\nanticipated as our Valentine's Eve Champagne and\nSparkling Wine special was interrupted by the Guild's Valentine squad serenading one of the attendees.\nHilary Mason of Wizard Wine, who has a confessed\nweakness for Champagne, returned to Imperial to give\nher second terrific tasting, Hilary shared with us\nChampagne anecdotes and some of her considerable\nknowledge and experience of wine. She also painted\nevocative scenes of wizened experts in deep chalk\ncaves (of constant temperature and humidity) deftly\ntwisting bottle upon bottle of fermenting champagne.\nWe started the tasting with a modest but tasty\nSarda Cava Brut for \u00a33.99; a Champagne-method\nwine from Penedes, Spain and ended with a superlative Asti Spumante from Fontanafredda for\n\u00a35.59 to demonstrate that this style doesn't only\nproduce sickly-sweet fizzy wines. The favourite wine\nof the evening was one of the Champagnes: the\nTaittinger non-vintage Brut (\u00a313.95) which had a fresh and honeyed flavour and great bubbles. This was\nclosely followed in popularity by the more expensive\nMoet and Chandon '83 vintage 'Brut Imperial' at\n\u00a317.95\u2014a very classy Champagne. All in all a very\ngood tasting, many thanks to Hilary and Wizard Wine.\nFor our next tasting we are lucky to have Moreno\nWines, a high-quality independent importer of Spanish\nwines, to come and give us a tasting. Other dates for\nyour diary s hold include the Australian wine tasting\n(27 Feb), the coffee tasting (1 March) and the Sherry\ntasting (6 March).\nSANTE\nP.S. Only a few places remain on the 21 March booze\ncruise so get in touch with Lynda Matthews if you\nwant to come along.\nDisneyworld first hand), why not try out for the team\nin the trials next year. The Dance Club is really on the\nball regarding social dancing too, so if you don't fancy\nyourself in the team, how about some Lambada?\nMany thanks to the Rector, the Union, the American\nuniversities for financial support. Also to our\naccommodating lecturers and to our self-sacrificing\npresident, Mandy, who made many of the\narrangements but was unfortunately unable to come\nwith us. We also appreciate the spadework put in by\nthe team members and of course our team coach who\ndid more than we could give her credit for.\nOpera\nOn Tuesday March 20 Imperial College Operatic\nSociety presents: An evening of music by Cole Porter.\nThe show contains some of the best songs of the\n'musical' genre such as / Get a Kick out of You, Night\nand Day, You're the Tops, I 've Got you Under my\nSkin, Be a Clown, Who Wants to be a Millionnaire?\nfrom shows like Anything Goes, Kiss me Kate and\nCan-Can. This should be a really good show, so why\nnot be in it? You don't have to have the world's greatest voice, we can make anyone sing! There are\nplenty of chorus numbers in the show and we don't ask people to audition for the chorus but if you feel\nthat you might like to step into the spotlight we shall\nbe auditioning on Sunday February 25 in the Union\nConcert Hall from 2pm onwards, otherwise we hope\nto see you for our first rehearsal in the Read Lecture\nTheatre (5th Floor, Sherfield) at 7.30pm on Tuesday\nFebruary 7.\nStudent theatre and music-making of all types is\none of the most enjoyable and rewarding parts of\none's university career, don't miss out on it.\nFor further information phone Sue Foister on\nextension 7406.\nPage 13\n\n"

    "content": "Afro-caribbean reply\nDear Sir,\nWe, as the Afro-Caribbean Society, are writing in\nresponse to scandalous articles written in FELIX issue\n858, dated Friday 9 Feb.\nMany comments were made which were either\ngrossly exaggerated or total fal a cie s. Although FELIX\nwould like to believe otherwise, no attempt was made\nat even contacting any members of Afroc so that a fair and factual account of events could have been\nreported instead of a biased and second-hand version.\nFirstly the police did not set foot on the premises\non the night as they were never 'called in'. Secondly\nthere was no evidence of 'professional drug dealing'.\nI don't know about you but I certainly don't call the\ntrade of a sum of money for plastic in e, rubber and\naspirins a professional drug deal. This is not pure\nspeculation as many students actually complained\nabout the 'poor quality' of the substances they\nsolicited. As there is no factual evidence of narcotic\nsubstances being sold we can only assume that none\nwere present.\nNeither the security guards, the doormen or the bar\nstaff saw anything which was definitely to the\ncontrary.\nWhat people are prepared to buy from others is their\nbusiness and their stupidity.\nThe event was only stopped due to a security guard\nalleging that a student complained about people trying\nto sell him drugs. The guard gave me the option of\nstopping the event or the police being called in. I took\nthe former option to keep the matter internal. Thus\nit was I who stopped the event and not 'the prompt\naction of Bar Manager Mike Smith' as was reported.\nI would suggest that much of the trouble caused\non the night was due to hot-heads under the influence\nof alcohol looking for a fight after they purchased a substance they found they couldn't smoke, snort or\ninject. (Although I did see a man try to stuff an aspirin\nup his nostril, which I quickly retrieved). How I pity\nthem1 The tendency of all the articles written was towards\nsheer sensationalism. The so-called attackers were\ndescribed as 'two large black men who probably\nweren't students'. Is this a serious attempt at\ndescription or a half-hearted one to impersonate the\ngutter press? Do you honestly expect someone to be\nable to identify a person 'fitting this description'? If\nso then you have at least 1 million suspects to sift\nthrough.\nWe would be the first to admit that security\narrangements on the night could have been better\norganised but to say that we should have checked\nUnion or ID cards as is common practice at all Union\nevents is utter nonsense. I can't remember the last\ntime I went to a Union disco and my student card was\nchecked, or maybe that's because they try to get as\nmany people through the gates as possible so the\nevent wouldn't be a total flop as they often are.\nThe name of Afroc has been dragged in the mud as\nwell as the characters of the members. This might n't have been so bad if our previous event, which was\non a similar scale and went without hitch, was even\nmentioned in FELIX. But what has grossly offended\nall Afroc members was the referral to tonight's International Night as an 'Afro-caribbean drug frenzy'.\nThis is an inexcusably racist comment that was totally\nunjustified and was put in merely for the t it il ation of\nthe editor and co. We demand an apology for the\nterrible way we have been treated and we don't intend\nto let the matter rest. We are considering taking it to\nthe committee for racial equality and will start the ball\nrolling for the speedy resignation of the so-called\neditor of this publication.\nOur name was slandered in no less than four articles\nin FELIX. So the next time you're looking for rubbish\nto fill space at least make sure it contains a certain\ndegree of truth and is reported sensibly.\nDavid Cornwall, Life Sci I, President of Afroc,\nwriting on behalf of members and supporters.\nMiners are chauvinists\nDear Dave,\nLast week's edition of the RSM magazine 'PIT' has\npushed me over the point of just ignoring the matter\nto a total feeling of anger and dissatisfaction with the\nRSM and its attitude concerning women and\nsexuality. The degeneration of the males' view of\nwomen and the subsequent acceptance of this by\nwomen is frightening.\nFirst of all let me say that the magazine is not funny\nand badly written; but this is not my main criticism.\nThe magazine featured songs to be sung on the way\nto Cambourne; the destination for lots of 's will in and\nshout in' with some rugby and hockey thrown in to\nswill and shout about. The songs are concerned with\nscrewing girls who are absolutely begging for it;\nespecially from our lads. The coach party also includes\nfemale supporters-how can they listen to this? How\ncan they enjoy the company of these people? What\nwill they do in the real world, outside Imperial, where\nthis total sexist attitude doesn't exist?\nAlso included was a picture of a topless woman\nsunbathing on a beach, supposedly in Cambourne;\ncoupled with the headline 'She's waiting for it'. Do\nthey associate people lying on beaches with people\nwaiting for sex? Should we all head off to Brighton\nright now and rape a few women? According to PIT,\nit seems we should think of women as holes, give\nthem 'what they all want' then shout and drink some\nmore,\nA recent evening lecture with a visiting professor\nproduced a promotional poster of a seismic trace\ndepicting a woman, reclining in a sexual position.\nWhen a DLB Officer (the 'active' portion of geology,\norganising lectures, fieldwork etc) was asked what he\nthought of the posters he said it was nothing to do\nwith him, but hoped that they would be taken down\nbefore the visiting lecturer arrived. Apparently it's OK\nto stick pornography all over our corridors.as long as\npeople from outside/grown ups don't see them; we\nmight get our wrists slapped.\nWhat gets me is that nobody complains, nobody\nexpects anything to change.\nThe problem doesn't just lie with the men. Often\nthe women act just as ignorantly. PIT is looked on as\na bit of a laugh, not to be taken too seriously. It's all\nharmless fun they say. The said issue featured a fat\nwoman, paid to take her bra off in front of men.\nPhotographs were used to compare her with a second\nyear geologist. She and many of the women in our\ngroup thought this was very amusing; and the subject\nwas apparently over the moon to be thought of in such\na manner.\nThis publication is sick and makes me feel so. I'm worried how these people will turn out; will they ever\nconsider what effect the RSM environment has on\ntheir attitude?\nThe RSM stinks and I am ashamed to be associated\nwith it, I hope Imperial College as a whole is not the\nsame; but I have my doubts.\nPeter Sharp, Geology 2.\nOverseas subsidies\nDear Editor,\nI have been puzzled for many months by IC and its\ntreatment of students. It seems to me that the main\nobjective of the College is to take as much money as\npossible with little or no return at all.\nTake this for example; being a British citizen from\nbirth and spending the last 12 years of my life here\nthe College sees fit to charge full fees which, for\ncompleteness, is \u00a36,000. The 'reason' that they give\nis that our family home is in America. How can they\nPage 18\nin all fairness give the above, which holds no water,\nor is this just prefabricated verbal rubbish. No one that\nI have spoken to can see the reason behind this or are\nin true IC spirit and too apathetic to do or say\nanything. Is anybody prepared to give a valid reason?\nIf not, I recommend that the status be changed before\nmy funding runs out.\nAlso, another pathetic attempt to get more blood\nfrom the stone is Fisher Hall. The 'Hall' sees fit that\nwith so many overseas students, with ample storage\nspace (?!) that we have to move our belongings\nelsewhere so that rooms can be rented. Many cannot\nmove their things anywhere and with insurance for\nfull storage at \u00a3 1 5 0 for everything, where is the\njustice?\nThese questions need to be addressed and\nanswered now before it's too late, or are overseas\nstudents doomed to fund IC forever?\nIan McGovern, Civ Eng 1.\n\n"

    "content": "Film\nThe Revolving Doors\nTheatre\nThe Dutch\nCourtesan\nThis is the first in a series of plays staged by The Man\nin the Moon Theatre highlighting the work of women\ndirectors. The series is actually called-yes, you've\nguessed it -Women in the Moon.\nThis first play is a cut version of John Marston's most infamous 'obscene' comedy in which the use\nof physical theatre helps translate the play into a satire\nof moves and manners. The drama highlights the\nhypocritical behaviour of men when the matter of sex\narises.\nSet in France in the seventeenth century the play\nmainly concerns the loves of two friends, Freevill and\nMalheureux. Freevill is the regular patrol of Mistress\nMulligrub's brothel and has a lover there, however he\nis about to get married and just give her up.\nMalheureux is a very righteous gentleman and would\nnever dream of frequenting a whore hou e. He also tries\nto make his friend see the error of his ways. Freevill\nis convinced that that if Malheureux just went to the\nbrothel once he would see that it was not as s or ded as he thought. Malheureux eventually agrees to\naccompany Freevill but only so he can show him how\nterrible this thing he is doing is.\nWhen Malheureux is introduced to Freevill's lover\nFranchesina he instantly falls in love with her.\nHowever, when Freevill tells Franchesina that he is\ngoing to get married and therefore must leave her, she\ngets very upset and vows revenge. Besotted with her\nMalheureux she goes to see Franchesina who tells him\nthat she can only be his lover when he has killed\nFreevill and brings back his ring as proof. The plot\nthickens...\nJohn Marston wrote many of the most successful\ncomedies of the seventeenth century either on his\nown or in collaboration, often with his good friend Ben\nJohnson. This play is written in the Shakespearean\ntradition with many subtle plays on words and\nrhyming couplets separating scenes. In this production\nthis is the only means of telling the end of a scene\nbecause the play is really only divided into two acts.\nOf course the play was not originally staged like\nthat\u2014it would be divided into many scenes-but this\nproduction by effective use of very few props and by\nusing the device of the four prostitutes sometimes\nmiming as furniture, for example a desk of table, the\nplay moves along a lot more smoothly and rapidly.\nThe beginning and end of the play are basically the\nsame with the prostitutes linking arms in the centre\nof the stage to the accompaniment of discordant\nmusic. This lends a feeling of continuity but it really\nrather mars the end as, again in Shakespearean\nt radiation, the play finishes with all loose ends tied\nnicely up with a short verse in the manner of an\nepilogue. That is most definitely the end as far as the\nplay and the audience is concerned and to have this\nstrange symbolic tableau at the end is rather\ndisconcerting. A good play on the whole though.\nThe Dutch Courtesan is running at The Man in the\nMoon Theatre Club, 392 King's Road, Chelsea. Once\nall three plays have opened they will alternate so that\nall three can be seen in any one week. Ring the Box\nOffice on 01-351 2876 for details. Concessionary\ntickets cost \u00a34.\nJLW.\nCeleste Beaumont is in the autumn of her life, in self-imposed exile in New York, spending her time doing\nwhat she loves most: playing the piano. At the same\ntime she sends a diary to her son Blaudelle (who she\nbarely knows) which tells of the life she has led.\nBlaudelle is disturbed by the message, his son\nAntoine, intrigued. Through the diary Antione follows\nhis grandmother's life, from her adolescence, to the\npresent day, learning the reasons for her\nestrangement from her son.\nThe Revolving Doors {Les Portes Tournates) is a French-Canadian film, with English subtitles. Directed\nby Francis Markiewicz, it has won a couple of awards\nand worldwide acclaim before its British release. It is\neasy to see why.\nThe film takes place on two levels-the life of\nCeleste in the past, and the reactions of her\ndescendants as they read about it. Although the two\nseen totally disparate initially, connections begin to\nemerge-the common piano talent of Celeste and\nAntoine and the similarity of the relationships between\nBlaudelle and his wife, and Celeste and her husband,\nbeing but two.\nThe period detail for Celeste's early life in\nCambletown, playing the piano to silent movies, is\npainstaking ingly recreated and is totally convincing.\nIt is little details like film posters advertising films of\nthe time that make all the difference. The detail is\nmaintained as history marches on-major events also\nmarking changes in Celeste's life. Through this we see\nthe two plot-lines merge as the reasons for situations\nin the present are made clear by events in the past.\nWhen the two finally merge at the end one is left with\na sense that it is only another beginning-not a true\nend.\nThe cast are uniformly good, with particular credit\ngoing to Gabriel Accard (Blaudelle) who makes a rather simplistic character into a rounded personality.\nMonique Spaziani (Celeste) also turns in a superb\nperformance, moving away from a straight put upon\nheroine portrayal to something more three\ndimensional.\nA beautifully plotted and imaginatively shot film, it\ngives us an enthralling story of a life, and the effects\nit has on those who follow, played against a musical\nbackdrop of the haunting theme You Don't Kill a Piano\nPlayer-composed by Celeste in her youth and\ndeveloped throughout her life. Superb.\nThe Revolving Doors is showing at the Canon\nPremiere, Swiss Centre, Leicester Square, from today.\nAdam T. Film\nSea of Love\nOccasionally a film leaps off the screen. Sea of Love\nis such a film.\nFour years ago Al Pacino starred in Revolution, an\nhistorical drama that sunk without trace-an absolute\ndisaster. Clearly Pacino has been waiting for the right\nrole to stage his film come back. He has most\ndefinitely found a winner. The plot is a classical\nfavourite. Pacino is a downtrodden cop investigating\na homo cide, who falls in love with the prime suspect.\nWhether one thinks it is classic or clich ed doesn't matter, because actors, screenwriters, producers etc\nhave worked closely to produce a rather succulent\nfilm.\nPacino portrays the cop, one could say again, with\nhis usual acting prowess. His ability to draw you into\nhis character is uncanny. I did not see the characters;\nI saw them through his eyes. The whole audience was\nin total empathy with him. This is a dead cert for an\nOscar nomination, but not the Oscar itself. The film\nwould be a must if just Pacino was superb, but there\nis more.\nMore comes in the form of John Goodman. You\nmay not know the name, but you will know him from\nhis starring role in Roseanne-he plays her portly\nhubby. Here he is a cop who is investigating a carbon\ncopy of Pacino's case, so they decide to team up with\nhilarious consequences. This film, however, is not a comedy; when the tension is building it eats away at\nyou, but just before it becomes overbearing a joke is\ncracked that eases this tension. Some of the humour\nconsists of one line wise cracks, much of it is set up\nsituation comedy; however all of it is central to the\nplot, it is not just hurled in for the hell of it. Therein\nlies the beauty of the movie it is very cohesive and\nfits together like a jigsaw.\nThe film opens dramatically with a man preparing\nfor sex, who is shot. Sea of Love is playing in the\nbackground. The only other connection is all the\nvictims are men who placed rhyming ads in a lonely\nhearts column. Suspicion soon falls on Helen as does\nPacino. Their sexy, stormy affair then begins. Some\ncritics find it unlikely that such a stunner would have\nto resort to the lonely hearts columns to find a man.\nThis does not bother me, she's a working girl with\ncommitments as you will see.\nThe ending does not fail to please with an\nunexpected but convincing twist. As you may have\ngathered I liked this film and thoroughly recommend it.\nSea of Love opens on Feb 16.\nCharles Tomkins.\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "Poll tax\u2014the facts\nby Union Welfare Adviser Yve Posner\nIn May 1989 I wrote an article for FELIX in which I tried to cover all aspects of the Community Charge\nscheme especially in relation to students. I did point\nout that the arrangements for some parts of the\nscheme were not yet in place and that it was likely\nthat there would be some amendments to the\nregulations before the first payments were due from\n1.4.90.\nIn this article I shall concentrate on those aspects\nof the scheme about which I have received the most\nqueries over the last few months. Any questions left\nunanswered should hopefully be resolved during the\n'Poll Tax Welfare Campaign' due to take place on\nThursday 22 and Friday 23 February. Representatives\nfrom Kensington & Chelsea and Hammersmith &\nFulham Community Charge Offices will be coming to\nanswer any queries. Even if you live in another Local\nAuthority area, your questions can still be dealt with\nas the legislation Is the same regardless of where your\naccommodation is situated. On Friday there will be an\nAnti-Poll Tax group representative to advise those\ninterested in opposing the scheme. In the article\nhowever I shall be providing facts only and will not\nbe concerned with the political and moral issues the\nPoll Tax raises.\nRegistration for the Community Charge\nDuring May 1989, Local Authorities carried out a canvas of all hous holds whereby a 'responsible\nperson' at each address was asked to complete a registration form giving details of each occupant aged\n18 or over. This 'responsible' person also has a legal\nduty to inform the Local Authority of certain changes\nin circumstance regarding the occupants eg when a person aged 18 or over leaves or joins the household.\nIn the case of students living in College halls of\nresidence the 'responsible person' is the College\nfinance department and for those in intercollegiate\nhalls or student hostels the warden is responsible. If\nyou are living in private rented accommodation you\ncannot assume that the landlord has registered you\nfor poll tax. Therefore if at this stage you have not\nbeen notified that your name is on the register you\nmust contact your local community charge office.\nThe addresses for the offices closest to Imperial\nCollege are listed below. If your office is not included\nyou should contact your Town Hall for details. You\nwill either be able to register by sending in a letter\ngiving details of name, address and date you moved\nthere or you will be sent a form to complete.\nYou should register for Community Charge within\n28 days of moving to an address. If it is found that\nsomeone has deliberately avoided registration the\ncommunity charge registration office has the power\nto impose a \u00a3 5 0 penalty. If that person still fails to\nregister then a \u00a3200 fine can be imposed. There is a right of appeal against the imposition of a fine.\nA student who registers late because they thought\nthe College had, for example, registered them, would\nnot be penal is ed.I have checked with the three Local\nAuthorities closest to Imperial College-Kensington &\nChelsea, Hammersmith & Fulham and Westminsterand they have all stated that at this stage they are\nnot imposing any penalties. Their aim at present is to\nget as many people as possible registered before\n1.4.90.\nPage 8\nMy poll tax is how much?\nThe Community Charge Register\nOnce you have been registered you should receive a copy of your registration entry. This should have\ndetails of your name, address and your full-time\nstudent status. Most students who were registered\nbefore December 1989 will have already received this\nnotification.\nIf you find that any of the details given in your\nregistration entry are incorrect then you should\ncontact the CCRO in order to have it amended. If the\nCCRO decides not to amend the entry, you have a right of appeal against this decision.\nYour Local Authority Area\nA person must be registered for the Poll Tax in the\narea of their 'sole or main residence'. The law dictates\nthat in the case of full-time students,-they must\nregister at their term-time address. It is likely however,\nthat situations will still arise where it is not completely\nclear where a student's 'sole or main residence' is,\nand it will therefore be for the CCRO to make a decision based on all the relevant circumstances of\nthe case. If you do not agree with the decision as to\nwhere your 'sole or main' residence is you do have\na right of appeal.\nIf you have a permanent change of address during\nterm-time then this will be treated as your new 'sole\nor main residence'. If by moving you come under the\njurisdiction of a different Local Authority you will then\nstart paying Poll Tax to them and cease payment to\nthe Authority covering your old address.\nYou must not assume that the 'responsible person'\nand each of the old and new addresses will notify the\nCCRO regarding your move.\nIf you have a temporary change of address, eg to\nattend a field course, this will not affect your\nregistration. You will still be treated as living at your\nusual term-time address.\nAmount of Community Charge Payable\nThere are three different types of Poll Tax:\n1. The Personal Charge-payable by adults aged 18\nor over in the area of their 'sole or main residence'.\n2. The Standard Charge-payable by owners of\nproperties not held as a sole or main residence eg,\nsecond homes, vacant properties.\n3. The Collective Charge-payable by landlords of\nproperties where there is a high turnover of residents,\neg hotel, short stay hostel.\nIf your landlord is proposing to charge you for your\nPoll Tax in your rent he will be doing so illegal y.A full-time student will pay the personal community charge.\nIt is unlikely that many students will also be\nresponsible for the standard charge as very few own\nproperties in which they do not live during term-time.\nHowever if you do own a property outside London,\nthe amount of standard charge payable will be decided\nby the Community Charge Office. If the property is\nrented out on a commercial basis then the standard\ncharge will not be payable.\nThe amount of Poll Tax that a full time student has\nto pay is 20% of the Personal Charge for the area in\nwhich he/she lives.\nAs most of you are aware there has been an\nenormous amount of speculation as to how much\neach Local Authority will be charging for the Poll Tax.\nI have contacted several Community Charge Offices\nand none have been able to give me a precise figure.\nThey have all stated that it is still too soon to say. It\nis therefore likely that we will not know how much\nthe charge is until we receive our bills. However I think\nit is safe to assume that the personal charge for most\nImperial College and St Mary's students will be\napproximately \u00a3 1 0 0 for the year after the 80%\nreduction.\n\n"

    "content": "The RSMU are the Pits\nLast week's edition of 'PIT', the Royal School of Mines\n(RSM) newsletter strongly re-affirmed the RSM's appalling reputation in its attitude to women.\nThis is not an attack on PIT's editorial group, this\narticle aims to illustrate the chauvinism of the RSM,\nwhy the way in which women in the RSM are\nperceived is wrong and why both men and women\nfound PIT offensive.\nPIT's page three had a picture of a woman lying\nnaked on a beach-the caption read 'She's waiting\nfor it'. The implication is obvious and should be\nthought through. The message was clear-if you are\nfemale and you are nude it is a clear invitation for sex.\nIf you think a woman sunbathing naked on the beach\nis asking for sex, then do you think a woman wearing\na short skirt is asking to be raped? And do you think\nthat if your mother/sister/girlfriend is out late at night\nalone she is asking to be attacked? If you accept even\nthe first of these scenarios it is indicative of the way\nyou perceive women.\nWomen and men are sexual beings, but women are\nnot just sexual beings-they are not sexual objects.\nThe picture on the beach showed women in a very\nsubmissive light, it showed a woman as an object, as\njust a receptacle for sex.\nI do not find all images of nude women offensive-only those showing women in submissive roles would\nI call pornographic. As in the world outside Imperial,\nmuch has been made of the fact that men too feature\nin pornography. In last week's edition of PIT, in\nperhaps an attempt to disarm those who would\ncriticise the three pictures of women either nude or\nsemi-nude, two pictures of nude men were also\nincluded. One picture was a back view of a bronzed,\nmuscle clad male. The image was one of strength and\ncontrol-unlike the woman on the beach-this human\nbeing appeared in no way submissive and indeed was\nnot shown in a particularly sexual light. The picture\nheld much respect for the subject, unlike that of the\nwoman with its accompanying caption 'She's waiting\nfor it'. The comparison is clear. The inclusion of the\nmale nude in an attempt to balance or excuse the\nfemale nude only served to further underline the\ndifference between the perception of male and\nfemale. The female is submissive, the male is all\npowerful.\nI felt deeply offended by the use of pornography in\nPIT. Why is it that some women appeared not in the\nleast bothered by the newsletter? Within the RSM the\n'traditions' of beer swilling, pornographic songs and\na uniquely offensive departmental newsletter go\nunchallenged. Within the undergraduate population\nthe pressure to conform to these 'traditions' is strong\nfor both men and women. Women who are not\noffended by, for example PIT, have, of course, a right\nto that view. I question the foundations on which\nthese views are based. Women are in a minority in the\ndepartment and are thus more vulnerable. I believe\nthat for women to accept the uniquely chauvinistic\natmosphere of the RSM is the result of a natural wish\nto be accepted - to be part of their department. I ask\nthese women to stop and think what they are\naccepting in a personal sense and in the sense of their\nwhole gender.\nThe male chauvinist atmosphere within the RSM is\nnot just offensive to women but to men also\nChauvinism is not just about a negative attitude to\nwomen, it is about the pressure on men to conform\nto a male ideal. What gives the RSM sports officers\nthe right to press u rise sportsmen not to play for their\nCollege but only to play for their Union. RSM is\nsynonymous with excessive, mindless drinking. RSM\nbar nights only further affirm the ethos; 'The best\nshape for a miner is to be in is a beer barrel.'\nWhy is chauvinism within the RSM so strong? Is it\nbecause of the macho image of 'geology'-is this\nmacho image justifiable? How many graduates will\never actually do the ultimate macho thing and dig a mine? Very few I suspect. There is a strong sense that\nhand-in-hand with the pressure to conform is the\nfeeling: it's not what you do as much as who you\nknow, that really counts. This is an illusion. The B in\nBSc does not stand for beer and bravado.\nThe chauvinism of the RSM is archaic. It is deeply\noffensive to both men and women. The patterns of\nbehaviour regularly displayed within the department\nare those of a time long gone by. The year is 1990\nnot 1890. Friday's De La Beche (DLB) Society lecture\nwas on seismic it y. The poster, a 'seismic trace' of a female nude. A DLB Officer when asked how he\nthought the professor giving the lecture would feel if\nhe knew of the publicity issued on his behalf replied\n'We're going to take them all down before he sees\nthem'. The RSM is ashamed and knows it is wrong.\nAnna Teeman.\nDo you know how\nmuch Poll Tax you will\nbe paying?\nOn February 22 and 23 Imperial\nCollege Union will be holding two\nPoll Tax information days:\nhow to pay....\nTHURSDAY 22nd Feb\nA representatives from Kensington &\nChelsea, and Hammersmith & Fulham\nCommunity Charge Offices.\nhow not to pay....\nFRIDAY 23rd Feb\nRepresentative from the Anti-Poll Tax\nCampaign\nBoth days in the JCR from 1\n1\n.\n3\n0\n-2\n.\n3\n0\nTHE HEALTH CENTRE PATIENTS GROUP MEETING on Tuesday 20th Feb\nHealth Centre\nGroup Room\n4.00pm All patients and potential\npatients are invited to air their\nviews on the Health Centre.\nConstructive criticism welcome.\nRing Julie on 3088 for info\n\n"
