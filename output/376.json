    "content": "BOOKS\nJohn Andrews Penguin Modern Poets (Fontana)\nWith the publication of this new volume,\nPenguin have now introduced us to 7 5\ncontemporary poets, an admirable achieve-ment. When viewed as a complete\nanthology, the series presents us with an\ninvaluable collection from which we can\nassess the calibre of modern poetry in\nBritain. In the last decade we have lost,\namong others, Eliot, Pound and Auden; it is not inconceivable that their eventual\nsuccessors will emerge from among poets\nsuch as these.\nOn the strength of this offering, how-ever, I do not think that the three poets\nwhose work is represented here \u2014 Gavin Ewart, Zulfikar Ghose and B.S. Johnson \u2014\nare likely to finish in the select band of\npoets for whom the adjective 'great' is no\nexaggeration. As with all the writers\nPenguin have offered us, their work is of a very high standard in general, and all three could be described as successful; but there are many others just as good.\nTheir work, although competent, does not\nprogress in any way from the standards\nlaid down in the last thirty years. This is one of the major criteria in distinguishing the major poets from those who are just\nwell practised in the art of writing verse.\nTo reach their standard is an achievement\nin itself, and for that reason I can re commer td the book as a suitable introduction into modern poetry. Some of the\nwork is very good; it never drops below\ncompetent. It is also, for the most part,\neminently readable. But don't ex.pec t too\nmuch from it, enjoy it, and remember'that\nminor poetry is the life b look of literature.\nArianna Stassinopoulos: The Female\nWoman (Fontana)\nThe Womens Liberation movement has been observed with fervent admiration,\namusement and cynical contempt. Ms., sorry, Miss Stassinopoulos is firmly\nentrenched in the latter grouping, and this\nbook is a detailed attack of the tenets of\nthe present liberal females who hope to\nelevate the status of women to that of the\nall-domineering males. Hovering in the\nLittle Feat: Dixie Chicken (Warner\nBros)\".\nANOTHER quality album from a band\nthat produce consistently good music and\nremain consistently unnoticed. The opening\ntitle track moves in with a shuffling beat\nsprinkled with honky-tonk bluesy piano\nand the unique larynx of Lowell George,\nwho goes on to power the whole package\nwith rasping slide guitar. The musician ship is typically tight and precise although\ngiving the appearance of laid-back\nrelaxation, as if at any moment they\nbackground are the evil spectre s of\nGermaine Greer and Kate Millet; these two,\nin particular, are singled out for repeated\nand often hostile criticism. Miss Stassinopoulos uses a great deal of\n' biological' reasoning, which is impressive,\nbut at times lapses in illogical, commonsense arguments; however, we have been\nbrought up to expect this from women, and\nas the lady is obviously an all-female\nfemale I suppose she thinks she can get\naway with it. Not so, Miss S., not so. The book deals in a systematic way\nwith the various roles a woman has in\nsociety, and attempts to reason that these\nare, in the main, natural. I'm sorry, ladies\nof IC, but a lot of it makes sense. On the\nother hand, I think she is being unfair in\ntrying to destroy the liberation movement,\nin that she clearly does not understand it.\nI personally see womens Lib. as a movement which is suffering from over-reaction\nto the problem. This is only natural because\nof the huge, fallacious tradition present in\nmost societies which believes that women\nare an inferior race. Given time, the\nmovement should settle down to a reasoned\nbattle against prejudice; the answer to the\nproblem does not lie in the ashes of Ms. Greer's gutted bras, nor in this book.\nIf there are any ardent Womens Libbers\nin IC, I recommend that you have a look at\nthis book, even if it only results in high\nblood pressure. Its semi-facetious tone\nsuggests hope that Miss Stassinopoulos is\nnot quite so anti-liberation as the book\nmay seem to imply.\nCandi\n'Modern Man Looks at Evolution'\nW.W. Fletcher (Fontana).\nWith evolution as its underlying principle, this book sets out to cover everything\nthat has evolved, from the inception of\nthe universe to present day society. Unfortunately, (it was a great idea, but\nwhat can you expect in 160 pages?), it\nfails dismally. More seriously, it also claims to be an 'ideal introduction for the non'scientist\ninto the ways of science' which I find very\nhard to swallow. To my mind whole\nsections df the book, especially on the\nastronomy side, were little more than\ntedious catal d gue s of facts that can be\nfound in any yearbook, let alone encyclopaedia. The general level of\ntreatment, especially towards the front of\nthe book, is pretty sketchy, but I suppose\nthat this is inevitable in such a limited\nmight miss a beat or two but never in fact\ndo.\nThe key to the band is the vocals and\nslide-playing of Lowell George. He has\ncomplete control of the instrument and>\nseems capable of imparting some blood-and-guts to the sould \u2014 usually the\nprerogative of straight electric guitar.\nBecause of this the music in its complexity is more invigorating than say a comparable band such as the Allman Brothers.\nWith luck, they might finally make it on\nthe Warner Brothers package tour currently\ndoing the rounds here, where, if there's account. All the same we find an assumption of basic concepts on one hand,\nand over simplification of ideas on th^\nother. There is also a liberal use of magic\nwords like 'scientist', 'energy' and\n'proteins' and too many throw-away\nphrases such as( talking of the moon\nlandings and probes) 'we now know nearly\nas much about the surface of the Moon as\nwe know about the sur fate of the Earth'.\nI didn't find the plates particularly ,\nilluminating either.\nThe main fault of this volume Is that it\nis trying to cover much too wide a field at\ntoo elementary a level. To appeal to the\ntotally ignorant layman a more direct and\nexciting approach is needed, while the\nserious amateur with only basic knowledge\nwill find it superfluous.\n'Occasions' Dorothy Hammond Innes\n(Fontana)\n'Occasions' is not a book that I expected to enjoy, being almost, the\nabsolute antithesis of my travelling\nexperience. Used to economy class, camping and walking to save bus fares, I find the whole idea of living in hotels and\ntaking cars a bit strange. Still, it's always good to see how the other half\nlives, and to my surprise I really enjoyed\ng looe hopping with Mrs. Innes. For devotees\nof the Mr.H. Innes, this scrapbook has some\ninteresting if obvious background glimpses,\nto his novels: the Australian outback and\n'Golden Soak' for example. Make no mistake, though, this travelogue\nis nothing more than a string of reminiscences of people, places and events on\na culinary thread. I found the di script ions of meals just a bit wearing after a while\nand they kept making me feel -hungry.\nAlthough I'm no epicure (or even a decent\ncook), I wish there had been an appendix\nof recipes to try.\nThe book is full of fun & enjoyment;\na typical bit is where the Innes' & pilot\nare flying towards the Olgas \u2014 another\nAyers Rock sort of thing.\"/ was studying\nHarry Purvis' fine profile when I heard\nmy husband say 'Oh, don't worry about\nDorothy, she loves it'. I was Just wondering what I was alleged to love when he\nrolled the plane over and we crawled up\nthe face of the Olgas, then down, then up\nagain, slowly, very close to the details\nof the surface\".\nIf you like travel and talking about\nplaces, you' ll like this easy, flowing\nbook. It's certainly more absorbing than\nany of the holiday-slide vignettes that I was treated to last year. I would expect it\nto be reviewed on Womans Hour and\nrightly so: your miss us or your mum will probably think it's great.\nHie\nany ius tice left, they deserve to stomp all over some of the bigger names on show.\nThis album is their third, and although\nnot up to the excellent standard of\n'Sailin' Shoes' remains strongly and\nun mistake ably Little Feat. There's the\ninsistent, hag gerd ly drumming of Richie Hayward, the stoned-out piano of Bill Payne and the drawling blues-based\nstance of George \u2014 ' t'sa shame that\nlesser music can become so popular and\nso many musicians of true quality go\nunnoticed.\nAKC0 AD8 "

    "content": "FELIX\nMichael Williams THE COMMON line was found. The\nthird sabbatical will remain with the\nEditorship of FELIX for the next year.\nFELIX is safe for the time being.\nLast Monday's council decision can\nonly be described as a victory for\ncommonsense inasmuch that any major\ndecision regarding the third sabbatical has been deferred until a working party\nhas thoroughly investigated the workings\nof the FELIX Office and the Union Central Administration. Any such en-quir y,I shall personally welcome for\nonly after prolonged discussion and\ndialogue in a working party atmosphere\ncan one begin to exterminate the naive\ntechnical misconceptions that swirl around FELIX' s new situation like a diseased mist.\nOne of the approaches open to the\nenquiry would be to see which concern\n(i.e. either FELIX or the soon-to-be-created job of Junior Treasurer) has\npriority in terms of importance and so\nwarranted a full sabbatical; that would\nsimply and inevitably lead to a divergence of opinion. However,, if the\napproach were to be the determination of\nwhich area could least afford to do\nwithout a sabbatical, then the resolution\nof the matter would be more clear cut.\nBe that as it may, one further aspect\nof the whole affair must not go un-broached: as in the case of the FELIX Editor/ Publicity Officer anomaly, it was\nthe initiative shown by the Deputy\nPresident which proved to be the important stepping-stone towards ultimately\nresolving the matter. Ron Kill has once\nagain provided the means by which the\nmajority has expressed its feelings\noverwhelmingly.\n*\nJohn Randall' s letter leaves me\nunmoved. The paradox so grub bil y exploited by the Daily Express remains\nintact:\n(i) Tfce NUS does not support violence;\n(ii) TheN US does not support the IRA;( iii) Some of the NUS policy on Northern\nIreland coincides with the aims of\nthe IRA; but does the NUS totally\ncondemn the very concept of the IRA\nand its aims? By premise (iii), it would\nappear not, but the spirit of such a conclusion appears to conflict with\npremise (ii). I feel sure at some time or\nother, someone must have said 'Paradoxes can be construed'.\n*\nCan it be the wind of change that is\nrustling through the portals of ICWA?\nI understand that constitutional moves\nare afoot to incorporate a political aspect into the Association. We await\nfurther developments.\n*\nIncidentally, Dave Lea's 'vicious\nband of rustlers' (Council Highlights, page 5) were those who kept on rustling their papers.\nLETTERS A LETTER FROM\nJOHN RANDALL\nThe President's Office,\nThe National Union of Students,\ni Endsleigh Street,\nLondon, WC1H ODU\n10th January, 1975.\nDear Sir,\nI must take exception to the\nstatement published in the last edition of your paper that I took no initiative to condemn\nthe bombings recently perpetrated in Birmingham.\nMay 1 draw your attention to\nthe following remarks that I made in opening the National Conference of the Union on\nNovember 29. On that occasion\nI said: 'There have been for some\ntime those who have sought to\ndiscredit this Union by a deliberate misrepresentation of\nour policy on Ireland. In the\nwake of the tragic events in\nBirmingham may I make it clear\nthat at no time has the NUS\ncondoned acts of indiscriminate\nterrorism, or the murder of\ninnocent people, be it by the\nProvisional IRA, the extreme\nloyalists, the SAS, or the\narmy. Let me repeat what was\nsaid on behalf of the Union\nafter the Birmingham bombings.\nAs an organisation that has\ncampaigned for an end to\ninternment and for a Bill of\nCivil Rights for Northern\nIreland, we condemn unres\"ervedly the bombings. They\nwill only serve to hinder\nprogress towards social justice\nin the six counties. I must add\nalso the specific sympathy of\nthe Union to those Birmingham\nstudents who were injured and\nmaimed in the explosions. But\nin so doing I must state that our\nviews of condemnation for the\nbombers and of sympathy for\ntheir victims extend, as they\nhave always done, to those who\nhave lived through the hell of\nthe last five years in the six\ncounties. The best memorial\nwe can offer to those who have\ndied, be they in Belfast or\nBirmingham, Deny or London,\nis a continuing and unrelenting\ncampaign for civil liberties in\nNorthern Ireland.\nAt this time we must ask\nwhether the measures announced\nby the Home Secretary will\nassist in achieving a solution\nto the problems of the six\ncounties. My view is that they\nwill not. The existence of the\nSpecial Powers Act and the\nEmergency Provisions Act in\nNorthern Ireland have not brought\nan end to violence, nor a political solution to the\nproblems. I fear that the new\npolice powers may be used\nin disc rim at ely against the left\nin this country, and against\nthose groups, such as the\nofficial Sinn Fein, who pursue\nby peaceful means the legitimate political objective of a united Ireland. The tragic\nless i ort of Northern Ireland is\nthat we will not establish civil\nliberties by accepting their\nerosion'.\nI am glad to learn from yorn r editorial that you are not\ncondemning me for this attitude\nbut I am somewhat disturbed to\nfind that it is not a position you\nfeel able to support.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Randall,\nPresident.\nENTS CRITICISED\nImperial College,\nJanuary, 1975.\nDear Editor,\nWhen 1 came back for this my\nfifth term at college, I was\nagain expectant at the bands\nFELIX \u00a9\nMichael J.

Once again the\nline up of acts seems to consist of tired and staid rock bands\nwith the occasional American\nFolk ie(?) who seems to get\nbooked to appear at IC on all his British tours. The inclusion of Nico, I presume, is to appease those with slightly more\navant e garde tastes, which is O.K. if you happen to like a single lady on stage rambling\non for an hour or so accompanied only by harm omi um. Certainly not everybody s cup\nof tea.\nHowever one only has to\nread the music press or talk to\nfriends from other universities\nbefore one realises the number\nof different acts who have done\nUniversity tours over the last few months and presumably\nhaven't been approached by IC. By these I don't mean the\nYes' s or Pink Floyd' s of this\nworld, who apart from being a bit expensive aren't much above\nthe standard of the band booked\nalready, but those such as\nHatfield& The North, Fairport\nConvention, the Glitter Band,10 c.c. etc.\nSurely the atrocious losses made at the Heavy Metal Kids and Chapman-Whitney-concerts\nlast term have sunk in, so why\nnot try a bit of a change, a bit\nof adventure.\nAbove all, my message to\nEnts Committee is, can we have\na bit of variety in the acts\nbooked ?\nA.P.

    "content": "FELIX11 Because of a disastrous\nGutteridge Cup result for IC last Wednesday, fitness training\nfor the first XV had been extended to Friday evenings.\nPress-ups, pull-ups and sit-ups\nwere not encouraged but a more\nspecial exercise such as too\nmuch Young's bitter was pre-fer red. Undaunted by this\nserver e test of stamina the\nBrave Bandits belonging to\nBruce Bradley set off to avenge\nthe aforementioned 11-3 defeat\nby QM C. Before the match started it was decided that tea and biscuits should be served to\nboth the backs and forwards to\nhelp keep out the effects of the\nconsistent drizzle and biting\ncold wind. Unfortunately six minutes into the first half the\nforwards were still dunking their\nbiscuits and consequently were\ntoo busy to stop a PLA forward\nfrom crashing over from a quickly taken short penalty.\nTen minutes later IC were\nawarded a penalty thirty yards\nout and in front of the posts.\nB. Finney elegantly converted\nand reduced the score deficit to\n6-3. The adverse wet conditions made handling the ball\nextremely difficult and both\nsides found it hard to produce\nclean possession from the\nline out s. Unfortunately IC were\nreduced to 14 men, ten minutes\nlater, when B. Stern had to\nretire with a badly bruised arm.\nHe was, however, expertly\nlooked after by our resident\nFlorence Nightingales, Janet\nand Anita. It is thought that\nnext week the two girls are\nhaving their heads examined for\nhanging around in such miserable\nweather.\nHalf time came and went.\nThe reshuffled IC side could make no impression on the\nscore line despite constant\ngood pressure from the forwards\nand steady play from the backs. Four minutes of the game re-maine d. The spectators were\non tender hooks and excitement\nmounted to a climax. Ray Hughes, a foi mer good player\nwith all his teeth, received\ngood ball from the pack five\nyards from the PLA line. Be cause I Chad had a two-man\noverlap from his blind-side\nbreak, Ray decided he' d better\ngo alone and s nook in for the\nwinning try. A minute later the\nref blew up but no one was hurt.\nIt was a deserved win and hopefully the side will now\ncarry on without losing for the\nrest of the season.\nTeam: Denso, Clumsey, Sterno,\nCuddles, Bobo, L. Lunch,\nEngaged, Sloop B, B1100.\nVerona, Nothandsome, lOg,\nAlias, D. Squared, M. Pius,\nIC Extra 1 sts welcomed the\nreturn of their star player, top\ntry scorer and captain for their\nmatch against London Irish.\nSurprised that the game had not\nbeen cancelled we arrived at\nHarlington to find a cold wind\nthat was blowing at approx\nlOOm ph( nearly as fast as S. Chudy) across the pitch. Had it not been for this wind we may\nhave run up a much bigger\nscore as it played havoc with\nthe passing. London Irish were\nnot as affected since the IC front row won so much ball, with great hooking by I. Shepherd,\nthat they rarely had a ball to\npass.\nThe IC backs did well cleaning up loose ball to stop\nLI getting any loose breaks,\nM. Gibson (not that one) doing\nvery well in this dept. The IC pack press uri sed so well\ncharging through line out s on the\nopposition half bakes that we\nspent most of the first half on\ntheir half. M.Kil brick at No.8 forced the LI wing forwards and\nscrum half to give away pen-ali ties by holding the ball in. Our first try came from a charge down by R. Sutton, who\nhad charged through the line out, the ball bounced just right for\nS. Chudy who ran the last 5 yd s and dived over with half the\nopposition on his back. The wind did not help the conversion attempt but H. Sayers\nlater placed a penalty kick over\n(London Irish disagree) to give\nus a half time lead of70. The second half was the\nmore even of the two with the\nball going backwards and\nforwards. The wingers who\ndidn't get many passes chased\nkicks in attack and covered well in defense and London Irish\nwere lucky to get their converted try. M. Gibson was unlucky not to score after a good run by M. Sergot but a last\nditch effort just caught him.

II.\nImperial College,\n24th Jan., 1975.\nDear Sir,\nI am writing on behalf of the\nproposed IC Sporting Motorc y cle Club in response to\nRupert Harper's 'Motorcycle\nColumn' (FELIX No. 3.74). I wish in no way to criticise Rupert's letter even if he might\nhave an tag on is eda certain\nNorvin owner and spelt my name\nwrong.\nI too think this Honda we are\nwanting to race is a good idea,\nbut \u00a3200, in my opinion, is a fair price, having just glanced\nthrough a few back copies of\nMotor Cycle News. I also believe that the first priority\nof the C&G Motorcycle Section\nis to find a good workshop.\nHowever, there are also in IC a number of people who are not\nonly interested in maintaining\ntheir own bikes, but also in the\nsporting side of the motorcycle\nspectrum. However, one needs\nmoney to go racing, scrambling\nor whatever, and this is where\nwe would come in. The C&G Motorcycle Section\nis, as its name implies, a section of the C&G Motor Club. If the C&G Motor Club had the\nfinances to race, no doubt they\nwould prefer to race a car, or\nperhaps extend the facilities of\ntheir already established Gokart and Pedal Car Sections.\nFor this reason it was decided\nto go ahead and form an IC Sporting Motorcycle Club. Thus\nthis club would direct its\nenergies towards motorcycle\nsport. This club is in no way\nintended to rival the C&G Section.\nWe already have the facility through the Southern 67 Racing Club and the British Motorcycle\nRacing Club Limited( 'Bemsee')\nto marshall at Snetterton and\nBrands Hatch. As a marshall, one naturally pays no entrance\nfee to the race meeting, is given\nfree meals, and, most important,\nis involved in the meeting itself,\nMarshalls are able to select\nwhich meetings they attend.\nThere is a one day Training Course on Saturday, February\n1st,2.30 to 5.30p.m. at Brands\nHatch, if you are interested\nplease see Martin Ble as dale, Room 674 Selkirk Hall.

As a foreigner I am probably less prejudiced, and as far as the\nabundant use of the word\n' fascism' is concerned as a German I know from my family\nwhat fascism really means.\nI do not understand why the\nNF does not share the responsibility which the people of\nthis country have from the past\nand which is widely accepted\nby the majority of the British people.\nAs a matter of fact most of\nthe coloured people in this\ncountry are British as a consequence of the past and the\nadvice to 'go home where they\ncome from' is not only inhuman\nbut also might probably be a sign of illegality. Since the NF does not\naccept any coloured people into\nits membership, why does it not\ngo further and accept only those\nwho can trace back their family\nto William the Conqueror or,\nbetter still, Alfred the Great?\nNevertheless, one can find a similar pattern of policies in various countries, e.g. in\nSwitzerland, (where Schwarzenbach tried to reduce the\nnumber of foreign workers); and\nin Germany, (with the National\ndemocratic party, at present\nfortunately almost disintegrated).\nAll these movements are\ncertainly not ' fascist' but the\npsychological background is similar.\nSure, the integration of\nmembers of society who are not\nSUPPORT I.C....

The J CR furniture\nfor instance, which is falling\napart:\n'I 've just had the estimate\nfor its renovation, arid it works\nout at about \u00a32500. The chairs\nat present have rubber webbing\nunder the seats, most of which\nhas torn. When they've been\nrepaired they'll be like these\nones' \u2014 he grabbed a nearby\nchair by the leg and flicked it\nonto its back \u2014 'with a wooden\nbase. Much more durable. And\nthe floor here' \u2014 he waved his\nhand at the floor of the lounge,\nwhich looks as if it has caught\nsome unspeakable disease \u2014\n'Is in a mess. We are going to\ncover it with a cord carpet. It's hard wearing and cheap but it\nwill cost a fair bit!'.\nRon also sits on the Safety\nCommittee, which is responsible for the safety of all the college buildings:\n'College safety is not as\ngood as it might be', he\ncommented. 'We are trying to\neducate everyone to be more\nsafety conscious. Many improvements can be made without\nmuch effort, like the new\nluminous fire signs in the Union\nbuilding'.\nI asked him how he finds\nout what the students want in\nthe way of facilities:'/ like to think my views\nreflect the views of the\naverage IC student.

The captain of\nthe Gliding Club at IC, Nigel Leak, and his committee,\ndecided to offer me the chance\nto experience this incredible\nsport in the hope that I would\nthen be able to write this\narticle to encourage some of the\nmore adventurous women amongst\nus to join.\nI should first like to give you\nsome idea of the way the weekend was spent rather than just\nspace fill with my feelings over\nthe matter.\nI, together with Sue Tanner\n( Physics I), were picked up on\nthe Friday night by Nigel and\ndriven to the Lasham Airfield in\nSurrey. On first sight, It was a little daunting but after a little\nDutch courage at the local our\nspirits rose considerably.\nIn the morning it rained, in\nthe afternoon it snowed!! Not\nthe most encouraging weather\nfor gliding \u2014 not for any sport\nin fact. We were shown round\nthe workshop (fondly known as the Brown Elephant!) where I saw my first glider close to. I found it difficult to believe\nsomething so fragile looking\ncould make me airborne. How ever, the actual strength of\nthese gliders is un doubt able this one certainly did not\ncollapse under my weight!\nIn the evening we were\ntreated to a superb pub meal,\naccompanied by a lovely\nselection of home brewed\nwines. Enjoyable as this was,\nit was not the most ideal\npreparation for the following\nday.\nWe were, called at 7.15a.m. to look out onto a perfect clear\nsunny but very frosty morning.\nWe arrived on the runway at\n8 o' clock and were scolded for\nbeing late, a well deserved\ncomment as already the gliders\nwere out and ready to fly. The\ngliders are towed into the sky at\nLasham in two ways \u2014 by aero-tow or by car tow. In the former\nyou are pulled up into the sky\nto about 2,000 feet by a small, powered aeroplane; in the latter,\na car speeding along the runway,\nhoists the glider into the sky. I was aero-towed into the sky\nat 8.30a.m. in a two-seater\nglider with my instructor Doug\nsitting behind me.\nThis part of the flight, the\ntow was superb \u2014 the view being\nlike a dream with pockets of\nmorning mist dotted around the\ncountryside (it was possible to\nsee Watership Down from here\\.\nThen came the slight shock as the tow rope was released and\nwe were just floating in the air.\nI must admit, I felt rather scared\nbut it was immensely exciting too. The nasty bit is experiencing the abnormal balance\nfeelings you get though I was\nassured that after one or two\nmore flights one is hardly aware\nof them. I was allowed to.\nexperiment with the controls'\nfor a little while and then we\nmade for the landing strip. Landing, surprisingly, (as I thought I would be scared stiff)\nwas really great fun. And there\nended my flight.\nThe hospitality and kindness\nof the people of the club \u2014\nboth of IC and Lasham itself \u2014\nwas superb throughout and I should like to thank all of them\nnow for such a good weekend.\nThe expense? You can afford\nto glide on a grant without a doubt but one also has to give\nup the time to really make a go\nof it. For details of the cost I suggest you contact Nigel Leak in Aero Eng. II or Indeed,\nmyself. The IC Gliding Club is\nthe second oldest In the country\nand Is a well established, well run organisation. It is a lot of\nfun, but also a lot of hard work.\nBut the feeling of gliding through the air as a bird is just\nindescribable \u2014 so do try it for\nyourself.\nAnnual Swimming Gala\nTo be held at the Sports\nCentre on Tuesday, 18th February at 6.00p.m. Free Beer and Sandwiches\nwill be provided for\ncompetitors and spectators\nin the Union Lower Lounge\nfollowing the event.\nAdmission will be by\nprogramme price I0p on sale in Union Offices.

This\nwas em baras sing since Endsleigh had already been\npromised the business.\nWeeks Hall was mentioned\n(See PreciPice, page 4).\nIn view of the present\neconomic climate, it was\nconsidered inopportune to ask\nfor an increase in the capita tion fee (the per-capita amount\npaid by local education authorities to the Union).\nA query was raised by the\nR SMA rep. regarding a report\nwhich mentioned ' Social Secretaries' and ' perks'. The\nSCAB chairman replied that the\nfew 'perks' were records but\nnothing monetary. He quoted\nthe college doorman at Ents' Concerts, 'This year's Ents\nCommittee are the most honest\nI 've known'.\nThe President reported the\nHealth Centre incident (See\npage 1).\nCouncil agreed to the\nPresident's recommendation to\nsend a' letter of support and a donation of \u00a310 to Alnwick College of Education which\nfaces closure by the Government.\nImperial College Operatic Soc.\npresents\nTHE* MIKADO\nby GILBERT & SULLIVAN\nTUES.

    "content": "FELIX SPORT LADIES FOUR S The 7th December, 1974,\nA.D. marked the first victory\nfor Imperial College Ladies Boat Club in the UL Winter IV s. We had four crews out, the\nCollege Crew consisting of\nsome of the hard-core fanatics,\nand three fresher crews who had\nonly been rowing for about\neight weeks.\nWith this sort of numbers,\nand our effective killer instinct we felt we had to win something.\nLadies from all parts of London\nassembled and the heats began.\nOur B crew hadn't arrived.\nThey' d been seen on the train\nbut not since. The fresher s' A crew went out and won their\nheat without too much strain.\nThe C crew then raced in place\nof the B crew and lost to the\nRoyal Veterinary College. At last the B crew turned up after\nbeing lost for two hours. They\nwent out and won their heat.\nThe College Crew were beset\nby hazards right from the start.\nOur rudder stuck and a slide came off. Too much! We\ndemanded a re-race, but they\nlet us race in the final against\nthe winners of the two heats.\nWell, before the final I came\nsecond in the Novice Sculls.( Only two people entered\nanyway). Then we raced in the\nfinal against Royal Holloway\nCollege and aUL Scratch IV.\nWe left RH C way behind at the\nstart, but it took some time\nbefore we overtook the UL boat\nand won by a considerable\nmargin.\nNow the fresher fours final\nwas a different story. Our\nsupposed victory was marred by\nthe collision of the two IC fours\nracing. I must say, I'd have\nlaughed if they hadn't been IC crews, but as it was, only\nre plus ive horror struck our\nhearts as it happened. Royal Veterinary College won.\nYet the ig no mies and quirks\nof fate which the day presented\nwere overshadowed by our\nvictorious' joy as we justly regarded ourselves as the best\nCollege IV in the University of\nLondon.\nCollege IV: cox.

CROSSCOUNTRY After winning both divisions of the London inter-colleges\nleague last Wednesday and\nlosing ignominiously to Mick Fuller' s entourage in the rain\non Saturday, the IC Cross Country Club journeyed to the\ngrassy wastelands of RichmondP ark. Here we met the teams of\nBrunei, Wye and the LSE. The start was delayed for\nsome time while Pete Foster tried to explain the course to the\nrunners. It must be understood\nthat Pete is at least eight\ntimes as unintelligible as his brother and thus each word had\nto be repeated and, occasionally translated, by his team-mate\nBob G led hill. By this time the\nrain, which had started when we\nleft Be it quad was quite heavy,\nand Mr. P. Donnelly of Physics III fame was called upon to\nstart the race. He failed, but\nwas given a second chance.\nThe park was in the wettest\ncondition that anyone could remember it, but that did not\ndeter Hurricane Houlbrooke\nfrom storming to the front for\nthe first mile. The race ended\nwith Rob All in son in front,\nAlf Gamett in fifth and I. Ellis just managing to beat Steve\nWebb (and about time) in seventh\nposition. The results, computed\non the back of a Commercial Assurance handout showed a decisive win for IC. On Saturday the team went\nto that haven of the Lesser spotted Mudlark, Parliament\nHill fields to compete in the\nUC5. A special mention must\ngo to Dave Houlbrooke who was\nleading the race at one point,\nand his double who finished the\nrace in fourth position and first\nhome for IC. Steve Webb ran an\nexcellent race and Mike 'What a blow' Welford narrowly avoided\nlosing the Hol be in House bar\nkeys in a girls' school of no\ngood repute.\nThe first team finished the\nrace a commendable fourth, being\nbeaten, predictably, by Oxford,\nCambridge and Borough Road. The second team came tenth\nand still managed to beat the\nLSE' s first team. I am confident\nthat this winning form will continue for the rest of the\nIC VISIT\nSIDCUP\nThis year's trip to Sidcup was looked forward to with anticipation by all, and suspicion by some, after the escapades of last\nseason. The scene was set when the A XV dragged three players\noff the street and forcibly extracted another from the student\nhouse region.\nWe arrived at Sidcup a half\nan hour late as has become\ncustomary this term. The 1st XV did not have time to warm up\nwhich proved fatal, for Sidcup\nstarted with a bang and were\nsix points up within two minutes\nfrom a converted try. A very\nstrong wind in their favour\nhelped them tremendously in the\nfirst half and IC found it\nextremely difficult to get out\nshort \u2014 found Booth in support\nand Smith touched down for an\nun converted try.

    "content": "4\nFEIIX\nPRE C I!P3C E In my last PreciPice( two weeks ago,\nsince the last FELIX was bedevilled by\nprinting difficulties) I spent a lot of\nspace explaining the need for a campaign against the cuts in educational\nspending, and showing that this was\ninseparable from the Grants Campaign.\nI think that this week's news shows\nquite accurately what the future holds,\nparticularly for students in IC.\nThe Science Research Council has\ndecided to offer 35% less postgraduate\nawards than in 1974. The claim Is that\nthere were not enough applicants qualified last year to take up all the\nawards offered; I am sure that we all know people with upper seconds who did\nnot get awards. The facts are that the\nscrews are being put on the S RC, and\nthey are in turn squeezing students.\nWhat is alarming to me is that most\nof the cuts are coming in awards offered\nfor engineering research. How many\nGuildsmen are going to be disappointed?\nThe obvious result of this will be to\ndrive research students into the arms of\nindustry, with a number of firms trying to\ntie students to contracts and to direct\nthe postgraduate's research.\nIt is not a pretty picture for final-year\nstudents. This is why the cuts must be\nfought with all the strength that students\ncan muster. It is in the interests of all others, lecturers and ancillary staff\nincluded, to support us. If the students\ngo - then so will the jobs.\nThe National Grants/Cuts Campaign culminates in A Week of\nAction at the end of February. The\nNational Demonstration is on February 28th. It is crucial that students\nsupport the activities of that week.\nSome people are not aware of the\nclaims of the Campaign. I hope to write\na short article for FELIX each week,\nwhich will cover an aspect of the\ncampaign. It is important that people\nread them, they are relevant to you and\nyour future.\nTwo-Year Terms?\nThere has been much discussion over the role of sabbatical officers\nrecently. One of the problems which\nmuch be faced Is the lack of continuity\nin the sabbatical posts, since a new set\nis elected annually. It is in our constitution that no-one should be able to\ntake more than one sabbatical year.\nThis is one provision the ethos of which\nI very strongly support; that is, we\nshould not allow the Union to be run by\n'professional students'.\nOn the other hand, a reality that must\nbe faced is that by the time the Pre s ident, for instance, has come to grips\nwith his job, and begun to understand it\nproperly, it is almost time for him to go.\nThis state of affairs is clearly no good\nto the Union. The Executive has discussed this\nproblem many times. A possible solution\nthat we see, is to change the constitution to allow a sabbatical officer to\nstand for a second term of office.\nClearly, if the Union did not want him,\nit would reject him. Furthermore, it\nwould provide an added incentive for\nsabbatical officers to get things done\n(though I don't think they usually need\nit, since in order to survive one has to\nbe committed to the job.\nThis is not floated out of self-interest; it is too late to be of any use\nto this year's officers. But it is worth a debate, and it may be of definite benefit\nto the Union. Weeks Hall\nThe Executive has decided to accept\nthe Governing Body' s decision on Weeks\nHall that it must remain empty until all risk is eliminated. However, I have three\nquestions to ask of the College:* It Weeks Hall is in danger of col-lapsing, and cannot be occupied\n(legally) by students, why is the\nWarden of Weeks Hall living on the\ntop floor?\n' The Warden receives an entertainments allowance of \u00a31.50 per student\np.a. To what purpose is the \u00a360-plus\nfrom the Autumn and Spring Terms\nbeing put, since there have been no\nstudents to entertain?\n\" Is it true that there are students\nliving in Weeks, and if so, why is the\nfloor that they live on (presumably\nsate) not filled with students?\nI asked these questions at the\nFinance Committee of the Student\nResidence and got no answers. Why? If\nnone are forthcoming the Union must\nreconsider its position on Weeks very\nurgently, as students are being deprived\not their own accommodation.\nTrevor Phillips Voluntary Levy\nThis is my last try at explaining it.\nTnose students who knew about the 35p levy thought it was a levy (paid on top of\nthe weeKly rent) that goes towards new\nbuildings. We discovered mat this is not\nthe case. It is in fact part ot t ne rent\nwhich is siphoned off for new buildings.\nWe asked for it to be discontinued for\ntwo main reasons:\n1. The fund will never build up fast\nenough to provide a significant\nnumber of new places. It was originally envisaged that it would build\na new hall of residence. Costs shot\nand the project was abandoned. The\nmoney collected over four years\neventually helped to buy 14 Queensberry Place. On average the levy\ngave an extra five places per year.\n2. It is more important, in the present\neconomic climate, that that 35p helps\npay the cost of running the Halls, and keeping them in shape; the Hall accounts are already under tremendous\nstrain, plus the \u00a313,000p.a. which\nthis change will give to the Halls should be of crucial significance.\nIn my view, it is not students'\nresponsibility to provide new halls; the\nGovernment gives us a 'maintenance\ngrant', to meet our bills, and it is for\nthat purpose that it should be used.\nUNION GENERAL MEETING THURSDAY27 th FEBRUARY A TIp mIN THE GREAT HALL Union Officers' Hustings\nIMPORTANT\nMANY OF YOU HAVE LOOKED FOR December that the practice of ac com FLATS THROUGH AGENCIES AND mod ation agents in charging pro spec HAVE POSSIBLY BELIEVED THAT ti ve tenants for their service is now\nIT IS ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO legal for so long as the customer\nCHARGE YOU A FEE FOR FINDING actually takes up the tenancy which\nA FLAT FOR YOU. is offered.\"\nA LETTER HAS BEEN RECEIVED SO NOW AGENCIES CAN CHARGE\nFROM THE UNION SOLICITOR.

THE RADICAL ACTION group is, according to its own words,\n'a student organisation set up in response to trends within the\nNational Union of Students'. One of its major aims is to dem-ocr at is eN US and make it more representative of the grass-root\nstudent.\nRAG does not propose\nd is affiliation from NUS but\nconstructive criticism. RAG wishes to prevent further\nalienation of the already disillusioned NUS membership.\nIn his speech to students at\nKeel University last Thursday\nMore On\nWeeks\nThere is still no developments concerning when or if\nstudents will be allowed back\ninto Weeks Hall. The con-sultan ts' report does not\nappear to have arrived at\nCollege as yet.\nThe President has addressed\nthree questions to the authorities:\n1. If Weeks is dangerous why is the Warden still there? If he\nhas a moral right to stay\nthere why haven't the\nstudents who should be\nthere?\n2. Who are the two students\nliving there? If the floor they\noccupy is safe, why- is the\nentire floor not occupied?\n3. What is Weeks' entertainments allowance for the\nAutumn term being used for;\nsince there are no students\nin Weeks?\nWhen questioned further\nTrevor Phillips said: 'There is no question of an\nattack on the Warden but the fact\nAndy Vallance-Owen, National\nCo-Ordinator of RAG and\nPresident of Birmingham University Guild of Students put\nforward several of RAG's aims\nand policies. These include:\nThe NUS executive should\nby elected by a national secret\nballot.\nDelegates to NUS conferences should be elected by\ncampus wide secret ballot, and\ninstances where delegates voted\nagainst their mandate be\nprevented (in the one case where this happened the\ndelegates were applauded!).\nThe restrictions imposed by\nNUS on speakers should be\neased. (The RAG is concerned\nwith the erosion of civil liberties\nin all fields).\nThe simplistic foreign policy of the NUS should be re app raised, (e.g. Note is taken of the\nproblems of dissidents in the\nSoviet Union \u2014 something at\npresent disregarded by NUS). While RAG is an umbrella\norganisation containing students\nfrom a wide political spectrum,\nit is not an 'unholy alliance'\nbut a new group providing the\nbasis for open debate on various\nissues.. Set up a local Radical Action Group now!\nthat Weeks remains vacant is\ndepriving a large number of\nstudents of accommodation\nwhich is \u2022their right. Whatever\nthe reason for leaving the hall\nvacant, wh qt I am questioning is\nthe justification for allowing a few people into the hall whilst\ndenying space to 60 odd\nstudents'.\nTHE BID to remove the third sabbatical from the\nEditorship of FELIX at last Monday's IC Union Council\nmeeting failed after a 'delete all and insert' amendment\nfound the common line which, crystallised most Council\nmembers' feelings on the matter.\nThe motion to re-allocate degenerate\nmotion\nthe sabbatical was proposed by\nJacqui Gerrard, the Hon. Secretary of the Union, in a paper entitled 'A Need for\nChange'. Several points were\nmade which outlined the need\nfor another sabbatical in the\nUnion's central administration\nto explore the realm of finance\nwith a view to being far better\nprepared for discussions with\nCollege in that area. The paper\nalso remarked on certain\naspects of FELIX. Mike Williams, the Editor of FELIX, answered most of\nthe points raised concerning\nthe newspaper and then went on\nto present his own paper which argued that without a sabbatical\na fortnightly FELIX would\ninto a poor communications service with lousy\npresentation and low readership.\nAfter the two speakers had\nanswered a few minor points of\nclarification, Ron Kill, the\nDeputy President rose to present\nhis amendment (See Council Highlights, page 5) which presented the case that Council\nshould not rush into making any\nsort of far-reaching decision\nwithout a full investigation\ninto the workings and the needs\nof FELIX and the Union central\nadministration.\nMrs. Gerrard and Mr. Porter\nspoke against the amendment\nand Mess rs. Parker and Mortimer\nspoke for it. On the vote, the\nmotion was carried over-w helm ingly. HEALTH CENTRE\nINCIDENT\nA REPORT is being prepared for the College Secretary following\nan incident in which there was difficulty in contacting the Health\nCentre at night.\nJust after 2a.m. on Monday\nmorning a girl in Be it comp laine d of abdominal pains. Two\nmale students attempted to\nphone the Health Centre (using\nthe number stated in the college\ndirectory: ext. 1038). However,\nthe call was answered by a security guard who said he\ncould not put them through as\nhe was not on the college\nexchange and could not help\nthem. He suggested Be it security who were however\nalso unable to help.\nThe President had arrived on\nthe scene by this time and\nwalked to the Health Centre\nwith one of the students. They\neventually got into the Health\nCentre with the help of Weeks\nsecurity. No-one was there but\non lifting the phone (ext. 1038)\nto dial for an ambulance, the\nPresident cut in on a conversation between the original\nsecurity guard and the night\nsister. The guard appeared to\nhave discovered he did have\nthe night number. The night\nsister was told the situation\nand at once got dressed. On\nreaching Be it it was found the\ngirl had recovered.\nHowever, such a course of\nevents could have had grave\nconsequences and so the\nPresident has suggested that all security staff should be sent a memorandum concerning night\ncalls to the Health Centre.\n\n"

My personal hell is boredom.\nFortunately the world is too\nbusy dropping bombshells \u2014\nexplosive, inflationary, verbal\nor otherwise, to become bored,\nbut it could happen. This is why\nthe oldest most boring institution of them all \u2014 the Male\ninstitution \u2014 needs a well placed kick to get it moving\nagain. The trouble is men take\nthemselves far too seriously. Their attitudes with regard to\nthemselves, their role in society,\ntheir lifestyle and even their\ndress, have hardly changed in\nthe past hundred years. In fact\nI think we can safely say that\nmen are gradually going out of\nfashion, which is why the\nconscientious male is joining\nGay Lib. Women in comparison\nare moving ahead at the rate of\nknots. They now play a dual\nrole in society \u2014 that of mother\nand breadwinner. Of course\nwomen have been emancipated\nby contraception, whereas\nmedical science seems to have\ndone little for the man. What\nwould be his reaction on d is covering that he too could bear\nchildren? (Actually I have a sneaking suspicion that a way\nhas been found but it's being\nkept quiet).\nOf course he wouldn't haVe\nto suffer from social stigmas.\nIf the doctor told an eighteen\nyear old that he was pregnant,\nhis last concern would be\nwhether he was married or not.\nThe social stigmas would come\nthough, and it would be Intere sting to see if a girl would\nfeel obliged to marry her\npregnant boyfriend. Shotgun\nweddings would assume a whole\nnew aspect. Expressions would\nhave to change. 'Bun in the\noven' would probably have to be\nadapted to 'He's got a little car\nin the garage'.

Not so much discrimination more a lack of\ndough.\nSEXISM AT IC!\nAn on ANY GIRL who comes to IC is going to have a hard time to\nbegin with \u2014 adapting to an all male environment isn't easy. One\nis not expected to miss female company because there js a popular myth that 'women don't like women' so generally one\ndoesn't admit to it. When you're starting university and living\naway from home, it's quite hard\nto adapt \u2014 when you're part of a minority group it's much worse.\nSettling in isn't so bad for the\nmen, who can easily find others\nto talk to, or who can live in\nisolation. It's when you're one\nin ten or even one in thirty, as on some engineering courses, that you feel conspicuous. Most cope with this; however,\nno girl can properly adapt to a male dominated society, which assumes the female element is there purely for the man's benefit. Most of the activities at IC seem to be organised in\nthis way, and it takes a great\ndeal of self-deception to enjoy\nthem and similarly intercollegiate activities. In these\nthe women involved to be tee-shirted, beer drinking, a ill ads together types like the men they\nmix with. I condemn these\nactivities because they sum up\nthe total attitude towards women\nat IC. We need something a lot\nbetter for the women here,\n(unless the attitudes are vastly\nchanged there's no point in\nencouraging women to come to\nIC). Please don't blame the\nwomen by saying that they could\ndo something about it. We're\nin a bad position and we need\nit improved. If and when something positive does happen,\nperhaps then we'll discover\nwhat it's like living in a mixed\ncommunity and not just a male\none.\nI'm not saying that life is impossible for women at I C,I'm just saying that it's difficult. When I see intelligent and alert\nfemales leaving after six weeks\nbecause they can't stand it any\nlonger, I know how they feel.\nThe attitude towards women\nat IC is purely sexist, and it's getting worse all the time. The activities such as the Rag Queen, BoB elle and Queen of\nJ ez competitions are thoroughly\ndegrading and insulting to the\nwomen here. Other insults are\nthe pictures in FELIX with their\nsickly, patronising dribble on\nsome misguided female who's been stupid enough to pose for\nit (I thought you said, they were\nintelligent and alert! - Ed).\nAnd of course there's the Men's Bar \u2014 No comment.\nIC Society for Social Responsibility in Science\n(ICSSRS)\nSpeaker: Sir Brian Flowers, Rector of I.C.

Many of these thefts occur during\nnormal working hours and the persons most likely to see\nanything untoward happening are those students and\nmembers of staff who are constantly about in their own\nbuildings. A polite 'Can I help you' to a stranger may\nbe the means of assisting a geni une visitor or it might\nprovoke a reaction which would indicate that the person\nis up to no good.\nRecent occurrences in the College suggest that\nillicit keys, either 'home-made' ones or other improperly\nobtained are still circulating. Whilst the manufacture\nand retention of such keys may not have been motivated\nby any criminal intent, their very existence does a great\ndeal to undermine security in the College. Persons still\nin possession of such keys are asked to forward them\n(anonymously if need be) to the Security Officer at once.\nIf you leave your pedal cycle on College premises\nplease ensure that it secured with a stout chain and\ngood padlock. Don't forget to insure it and retain details\nof the serial number.\nFrequently, document files containing lecture notes\nbearing no details of their owners are handed in at the\nSecurity Office, Some of them are never claimed though\nno doubt worried students are still searching for them.\nA name on the file would prevent a lot of worry.\nA.D. Dawson,\nSecurity Officer.\nCharles Louis son A FEW weeks ago a cassette arrived in the FELIX office,\nwhich the Editor asked me to review and I thought, it must be my\nlucky day, something new to listen to. Unfortunately I should have\nread my stars that morning ' cos they said that I was going to\nget lumbered and I did! The title of the cassette is\n'Unwillingly to School' produced\nby an outfit called Seminar\nCassettes, who purport to produce tapes on subjects ot\n'International concern' (their\nwords not mine), and it contains\na long and fairly boringly\nstructured explanation of the\neducational systems in America,\nFrance and Russia, suppler\nmen ted by a brief discussion on the flexibility of curricula\nwithin schools, the exam\nsystem and the status of\nteachers. The subjects are\ndiscussed almost totally with\nreference to primary and secondary education, and introduce\nno earth-shattering information\nwith the possible exception of a western-biased view of the\nSoviet education system.\nHowever the section on the\nstatus of teachers leads to an\nimportant subject with relevance to IC and undergraduates\nin particular, and that is the\nstandard of lecturing within the\ncollege. The current view of\nacademics is that the standard\nof undergraduate achievement\nis lessening as years go by.\nPerhaps that\u2014is true, perhaps\nnot, but if it is, how much of \"trie\nerosion is due to students, and\nhow much is due to inadequacies, within the teaching\nstaff of the college? One possible, and I believe probable,\nanswer to the question is that,\nwith the increase in the quantity\nand diversity of the information\nto be transmitted, the lecturers,\nfew of whom have had a significant period of formal teacher\ntraining, are becoming overwhelmed by their task and\nconsequently less able to put\nover the information satisfactorily. This is a situation that\nshould not and must not be\ntolerated especially in future.\nUndergraduates represent over\n6 0 % of the student body of this\ncg ll'e ge and we are entitled to\ngood lecturing. Although,\napparently, Heads of departments are now seriously questioning the teaching\ncapability of prospective\nacademic staff, this will not\nrectify the situation for several\nyears to come, and it is time the\ncollege thought seriously of\nremedial courses for existing ADDITIONS AND AMENDMENTS\nTO I.C.
