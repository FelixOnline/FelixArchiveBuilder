Such problems which have been suggested so far include: Disposal of public and industrial wastes as effluentS| Water resources and pollution; Land Use; Urban Transport, Me chan is ed building( of dwellings) and use of new materials in such buildings.

Apply s.Kup as rim on ko lE.E.2, Means Test The vast majority of parents paid their full contribution under the means test. Many parents exceeded this* Those parents who\ndid not pay their full contribution usually mad \u00a9 up for it in some\nother way e.g. providing clothing, free ac coa a a oda tion in vacations or the student was able to make it up by vacation earnings. Vacation Employment Th\u00a9 average profit from this was \u00a3 7 0 p.a. However25% of students obtain no vacation employment and others lose on it. Living Expenses The average expenditure of students on essentials! rent, food, heat and light, travel, books, clothing and other essential extras was as fellows: Students living at home \u00a33/-/- P \u00ab w. Students living in hall \u00a38/10/-p.w \u00bb\nStudents living elsewhere \u00a39/10/leaving \u00a32/10/-, \u00a3 2 / 1 0 / - and \u00a31/10/\nper week respectively for spending on nonessential items. The point is made that one of the reasons for siting a University testis that students can take advantage of the facilities of Central London and30/ per week is inadequate for this. It is in te^stis g to compare Collin ge's findings with those of a similar, but more comprehensive survey conducted by Keith Cavanagh for the A.S c.W three years ago.

As stated above, this is only a preliminary report and FELIX hopes to do a more comprehensive coverage on the final version when this is available. J.D. Cooper. "

    "content": "EDITOR'S eminent Cooper*s Dictionary of I.e.' Expressions defines\" apathy nas\" an imaginary state of mind amongst the majority of the student body invented by Union Officials who have failed to capture the imagination of the said student body\". Nowhere is this in evidence mo: *\nthan in the dsp lora M \u00ae attendances at Union Meetings. A seri6 us situation exists when constituent College Union Meetings attract, from less than half of I.e., more than a nX.C. U. General Meeting. So what has caused this state of affairs I* The most popular scapegoat has, atleast since I have been here* been student apathy, a universal scapegoat capable of explaining virtually every failure which has happened. It is a nice sort of scapegoat because no one can disprove i t*,(^owe^r^ Id^i if ica ii on.'>& fa'%MJ\no$ Ll \u00a3t \u2022tM tft df the cause of this malaise hardly contribute towards curing it since one is them left with two possibilities either it i \u00ab jan intrinsic property, of I.e. students that the majority are apathetic; or it be get he question of what causes the apathy. It the former id the case then we might as well all pack up and in monastics tn dio us ness get on with our work. I'm sure the chuck out rate would drop dramatically. Very good things degrees. Or perhaps the second alternative is nearer the truth. Perhaps all that is wanted is a feeling of interest and relevance to the average Union member. Worthwhile as it may be to write letters to Vietnam, setup ICS ASAP or protest about Overseas Students fees these concern very few students directly. Given the premise that students are not intrinsic ly Apathetic, what is needed to capture the imagination of the Union?. Certainly the periodic outbursts of Mr Duck ett have, in the past18 months failed to have this effect as have the stirring sessions of the\" politicians\". Perhaps the Introduction of\" sport\" would enliven these meetings. This seems to be the main attraction at Constituent College Union Meetings and PCS, for one, also manages to do some serious business* Maybe the night of an executive in their underpants and a few paper darts would pack the concert hall.Asan experiment it could hardly be more disaster o us than secretary Harris' s of not publishing an agenda for the last Union meeting* But without going to such lengths and extending the pan to mime season all the year round, there is it seems to me much that can be done. First and foremost we need business that will be of interest to most Union members, which in general rae an s relevant to them. Secondly we need publicity; a start on this has been made by using the year reps; posters should have been put up not more than a week te fore the meeting so that they have not become part of the scenery by the time that it arrives; and the;\"\nshould concentrate on the business rather than Superman pictures. I uh ink FB LIX hereby keeping everyone informed on what is likely to corne up, thus helping to for man organised opposition, sadly lacking recently, and also by acting as a forum for discussion through the letters column. This should in no way detract from discussion at Union meetings, but would give the subject a complete airing and give people time to think it over, before a vote.

    "content": "The Association of Scientific Workers was formed by groups\nof scientists in the year 1918. In World War One groups of\nscientists were formed within government service for the first time in history. No-one in the Government really knew how science\ncould he used nor what scientists should he paid. When the\nscientists raised the question of reasonable hut higher salaries they were told that the Government only negotiated on salaries with a Trade Union and so the scientists formed such* a Trade\nUnion. Prom 1918 to 1939 the Association campaigned ceaselessly for scientists and engineers to receive decent salaries and\nconditions.. which they had not... and for industry and government\nto use science.. which they did not.. Among our successes during this period can he recorded the formation of the Parliamentary Scientific Committee, which brought Science to M. P.rs. In\naddition it was left to the Association to sponsor a Private Bill in Parliament to make illegal the award of spurious science\ndegrees by commercially minded individuals. There was, for example, one lady who, if$ ft& approved of you_ after an interview, would award you the D.Sc \u00a9 ( London). for a fee of 3 guineas \u2022 In 1936\nthe Association made its first representation toD. S.I.R. on\nbehalf of D. S.I.R. financed post-graduate students. At this tine also the Association. attempted to pur sua de the Government to increase its money spent on research from \u00a31 nd lli on to \u00a3 ? million but failed because the Government thought that such a sum w \u00a3.s much\ntoo large. m*>.:< During World War Two the. Association campaigned for the use\nof science in war and in the peace that would follow. Many of the\npost-war patterns in the development of science and technology\nfirst emerged from conferences organised by the A.s c.W. In1946 the Association produced as a Penguin the first attempt to prepare\na scientific plan for the. development of Britain combined with\na rapid increase in science and technology students. It may seem\nstrange in1968,to realise, that just* over 20 years ago there had\nto be a campaign for the rapid increase in the number of such\nstudents and for the rapid increase in the amount of money spent\non scientific res earp hand development. It was only 10 years ago\nthat the first governmental, surveys were carried out to determine\nhow much the country was spending on scientific research and how\nmany scientists1 and* technologists there were.\nIn the past ten years the Association, whilst dealing day\nin and day out with the salaries and conditions of service of\nm mJAa* numbers, has produced documents on all kinds of Science\nPolicy topics( Science Policy* Policy for the application of the\nScientific Method to any general social and economic problem.)\nand has made some impact on Government and UriUversity thinking. Dealing specifically with Transport during this period there\nwas an' A.S c.W. study group formed in the London Area which included as members..an adviser to the Ministry of Transport, a member of\nof the G.L.C. Planning Department, a member from the Operational Research section of the British Transport Commission, a member\nfrom aN. E.D.C., a lecturer in economics etc. \u2022 \u2022 \u00bb \u2022 \u2022\nIt is a basic axiom .of the Association that it exists as an\norganisation to meet the needs of its members and to advance the\nuse of j sci. en.ce and technology within Britain. Currently our\nmembers are voting by ballot to amalgamate with another\ntechnically based trade union to form the Association of\nScientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs and already50$ of our members have personally voted. This is an example of the\ndemocratic spirit of the A.S c.W...'* \u2022\n. As . specific examples of what the College Branch alone had\ndone for I.C. Students we can point to the dropping of the \u00a35\nbreakage deposit, the insistence by I.C. for students to report\nSafety Hazards and the care that I.C. takes to ensure that P.G* demonstrators are always paid for their demonstrating work. What\nwe have achieved has arisen from the discussions and activity of\nthe Student Group of the Branch. Our student activity is complementary to that of the College Student Unionc and only\na technical difficulty has prevented our Student Group from\nbecoming, an. I.C. Union society over these many years of its existence. Our Trading scheme offers wide discount facilities and membership has other advantages*\nThere is much to do.. the Association is dedicated to constructive changes and has an exciting history to prove it I So Join now using the printed form on the back of this page\nand ALSO COME TO OUR MEETING.. .THURSDAY. .TO-MORROW. .ROOM #08,\nElectrical Engineering Department...1.15.... WE HAVE SOME HEWS FOR YOU ON PARKING\nJan.1968\n\n"
