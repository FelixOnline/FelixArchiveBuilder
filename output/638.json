    "content": "Palin's Panache\nThe Missionary, Cert 15, Directed by\nRichard Loncraine playing at the Classic,\nHaymarket from March 4.\nWell, I 've really been enjoying myself this\n\u2022week; a couple of really rattling good\ncomedies, and a quite passable biography/\nmelodrama. 1982 may have been a thin year\nfor comedy, but 1983 is already shaping up to\nbe a good year for the chuckle rs. The Missionary is the brainchild of that\nstalwart of lunacy Michael Palin who wrote it\nand takes the title role, but leaves the directing\nin the capable hands of Richard Loncraine. In\ncase I need to remind anyone, Michael Palin is\npart of the infamous and insanely talented\nPython team, who since the early seventies,\nwhen they stopped working on the television\nseries, having indulged themselves in projects\nof varying commercial success. The last major\nPythonesque effort was Life of Brian in 1978,\nbut this year is evidently a renaissance at the\nbox office for the various members of the team\nwith this solo effort and with The Meaning of\nLife and Yellowbeard warming up on the\ntouch line. Palin plays Charles Fortesque, a missionary\nrecently returned from Africa to find that the\nfrontier of religion is not Somalia or the\nLimpopo, but deepest, darkest Whitechapel.\nHe is assigned to go among the fallen women\nof the East End, find out what they do, why\nthey do it and stop them doing it.\nUnfortunately Charles unaware that religion\nmust be applied with rather more orthodoxy\nthan he has been used to on his travels. His\nfree adaption of the message of hell and\ndamnation to concern and friendship meets\nwith disapproval. The gusto and enthusiasm of\nthis unstoppable farce collides head on with\nhistory's greatest immovable object: the\nchurch, with its attendant morality hierarchy\nand hypocrisy. To add to the complexity of\nCharles' life, his mission is funded by Lady\nAmes who has designs on his body and he has\na fiancee who seems to have channelled all\ncarnal desire into her rubber stamps and\ncross-indexing system and has her virginity\ncarefully filed under honeymoon.\nThe male supporting case are all equally rich\ncharacters, each with an element of the\nabsurd. It is this barely controlled element of\nlunacy that has Palin stamped all over it. Were\nthis a Python, then these characters would be\nunleashed fully; as it is, their absurdities are\noften merely hinted at and it is this very British\nunderstatement that gives the film its charm.\nSir Michael Horden is a real gem as an\neccentric butler who has trouble finding his\nway round the Ames's mansion after 25 years\nin the job; dinner is a disjointed affair as he\nwanders around with the fish course; Horden\nis a great actor of the old school who can say\nmore by simply lifting one eyebrow than could\nbe said in a five minute monologue, after many\nyears of service on the British stage and\nscreen, his recent honour was long overdue.\nReally, it's wrong to pick out single\nperformances in this film, in which every actor\nseems to fit the part like a hand in a glove\nPhoebe Nicholls (Cordellia in Brideshead)\nplays the fiancee, Maggie Smith plays Lady\nAmes the bored aristocrat, and Denholm\nElliott the Bishop of London, a man with\npolitics rather than preaching on his mind and\na penchant for healthy pursuits involving\nyoung men in short trousers bashing the\ndaylights out of each other.\nPalin's missionary is the focal point of the\nfilm, a sympathetic figure of boundless energy\nwith a no-nonsense approach to religion. Palin\nis saying that to the church establishment and\nthe upper classes that ran it in Edwardian\ntimes, the working classes were as foreign as\nthe natives Fortesque had just left. So he\nadapts two messages and gets it across to his\nnew congregation, just not quite in the way the\nBish had in mind.\nThe film in many respects is a satire of\nEdwardian class and morals, but it is not a satire of heavyweight proportions, so\nimpressed with its own daring at attacking the\nsystem that entertainment is the casualty. But\nPalin has probably more ex peri ance of modern\nsatire than any other writer. He and his co-conspirator Terry Jones date back to the early\nsixties to one of the twin cradles of modern\nsatire: Oxford, and worked with David Frost in\nthe first for rays in the field: The Frost Reports.\nThe experience produces a fine blend of\nhumour and satire which gets across the\nmessage without bludgeoning the audience\nover the head with it and without an obsessive\ndesire to be shocking and daring, and the\nsatire only becomes appa rant when the\naudience has a chance to reflect afterwards.\nOf course it is easy to say that it is weak satire\nagainst an easy target; few would defend\nEdwardian morals and the role of the church\nfrom a modern perspective, but this does little\nto detract from the skill of the writing.\nThis transition from wacky abrasiveness to\ngentle rib tickling and pathos displays yet\nanother facet of this multi-talented writer, it is\na warm and intensely enjoyable experience\nthat you will sav our for a long time after, and\nperhaps your mother will at last understand\nwhat you saw in that sordid upstart who used\nto taunt and jibe from the small screen.\nMichael Palin-and friends\nREVIEWS KlSgjjp\nFavourite Year\nMy Favourite Year, Cert PG, directed\nRichard Benjamin, playing at the Plaza,\nLower Regent Street.\nPeter OToole is a man who has graced the\nstage in its various forms for more years than\nprobably he cares to remember. A man who\ncan turn to comedy as easily as tragedy. For\nhis performance in this film he finds himself\nonce more nominated for the Best Actor gong\nat the annual Hollywood back slapping/ back-biting shindig; I just hope he gets it this time, he\nplays Alan Swann, a swashbuckling matinee\nidol of yesteryear who bears a 'passing'\nresemblance to Errol Flynn ?nd who is to star\nin a top-rated TV show, 'The Comedy\nCavalcade', an apparently simple little\nmusketeer sketch involving him and the\nregular team. Unfortunately, the one major\ndemand is that he should be sober. As\nSwann's love affair with the silver screen\ncooled, so his affair with the bottle has\nblossomed and now he is a burnt out alcoholic\nis not appreciated by his hearts desire. Swann\nadvises him that romance is the answer as\neven the most emancipated and career minded\nyoung lady likes the physical pill sugared with\ncandle-lit te tea te te and large numbers of\nroses.\nPeter O 'Toole drips charm. His relaxed\nlanguid manner, emphasised by his languid\nblue eyes, permeates the whole film. This\nmanner is helped to a degree by the booze;\nindeed he is often so relaxed he is unable to\nstand upright, and falls over in a languid,\nrelaxed, and amazingly dig in if i ed manner. I can\nsee that when it comes to looking your best\nwhen drunk it is merely a matter of practice.\nAmateurs like you or I will simply have to keep\npractising to achieve this level of distinction.\nMr O 'Toole says memorable lines like, when\nfaced with the prospect of live television in\nfront of an audience he exclaims 'I'm no actor,\nI'm a movie star'. A fine distinction, which\ncould never be levelled at OToole with his\nrecord on the stage.\nHey, that's my girl! Swann weaves his\nliving on memories of past triumphs and\nincreasingly unable to distinguish between\nfilms and real life. After he turns up a a production meeting, performs a forward roll\non the table and then passes out, some of the\nproduction team get cold feet and the feeling is\nhe'll have to go. Bui _\nidol and stakes his job on getting Swann to the\nright place at the right time with a clear head-So he becomes Swann's minder and attempts\nto keep an eye on the tempestuous Swann as\nhe bowls through the Manhattan high life.\nThus begins Benjy's favourite year as a relationship from s between idol and idol is er. But not being one to skimp on plot, we are not\nonly treated to the amazingly lopsided\nrelationship between these two, but also\nattempts by the neighbour hod muscle men to\n'remove' (vertically upward) the show's host in\nthe name of good taste. The show has lately\nrun a series of sketches which un flatteringly portrayed certain feature1 c kari KojecK, a man of impeccable reputation, who doesn't believe in letting a little thing like the law cloud\nhis horizons. These sketches are felt to be in\nbad taste by Rojeck who employs a rather\nphysical form of censorship. We also have\nBenjy's rather modern form of courtship which\nspell on K.C. Benjy Stance is played by the unknown\nMark Linn-Baker, an actor whom I'm sure\nmuch more will be heard. He copes with\nSwann's foibles in a sympathetic way. To him\nSwann is still the swashbuckling hero of\nyesteryear; he believes in him and refuses to\nsee the burnt out wreck. Beneath it all, he\nknows, is his boyhood hero. In a touching\nclimax, Swann is also able to believe in himself\nagain; he is prepared to live with himself and\ndiscard that alter ego fr cm the bottom of the\nbottle.\nThis is Richard Benjamin's directing debut\nand draws on his own experiences of that\nperiod when he worked for NBC televsion and\nalso those of his patron Mel Brookes who\nworked with Errol Flynn (who was also known\not have a drink or ten). It is certainly a confident debut; success in the tricky world of\npathos and slapstick comedy has eluded far\nmore experienced men in their time. But this is\na definite winner. It had my sympathy and\ncaptivated me from the moment O 'Toole\nswept onto the screen until the credits rolled; a great triumph for all concerned.\nCrushed Spirit\nFrances, Cert 15, directed by Graeme\nClifford, now showing ABC Fulham Rd.\nThe third of this week's trilogy is perhaps\nthe least satisfying. It treats a similar theme to\nMy Favourite Year in a rather different way. It\nis the 'true' story of Frances Farmer, played by\nJessica Lange, a star of the pre-war silver\nscreen. Instead of being content like Swann to\nbecome a movie star, ignore acting and reap\nthe rich rewards that stardom offers, she\nrefuses to come a cog in the show business\nmachine and wishes to be remembered as an\nactress, not a pretty face in a thousand\npublicity stills. Never one to court popularity,\neven when young, she outraged her deeply\nconservative neighbourhood by winning a local\nessay competition with an entry arguing\nagainst the existence of God, remember this is\nin the 30s and that sort of thing really wasn't done. In it's two and a half hours, the film\ntraces here steady downwards spiral from her\npinnacle as a Paramount star through various\ntantrums and institutions to her finale,\nlethargic and lobo tomis ed on 'This is Your\nLife'.\nKim Stanley plays Frances's mother who\nhas sought to bring Frances up to be free-willed, creative and independent and believes\nshe will realise her fondest ambitions when\nFrances signs up with Paramount for a seven\ny Sar contract. It is the Hollywood of the\ndepression years and the op u lance and\nglamour lives side by side with the Hovervilles.\nand soup kitchens. This is more than Frances\ncan take and she despises the gloss and glitter\nand quits. Thus the plan backfires and Mrs\nFarmer embarks on the treacherous and'\nultimately unsuccessful scheme of crushing\nFrances's spirit until she will not refuse her\nmother's wishes. Briefly it works and Frances\nreturns to her old studio. But the moguls have\nlong memories and she is punished for her\ndisobedience by being given demeaning roles\nwhich consist largely of falling into mud\npatches, fifteen times 'just to get it rio ht'. The subject matter is fascinating; in her\none woman campaign after truth and reason\nher forthrightness alienates those around her\nwho feel uncomfortable under her searching\ngaze. Unfortunately there is very little in the\nfilm to lift it above a pedestrian pace, it is all a j bit deadly earnest; tragic melodrama without\nany real sense of suspense, it all seems so\ninevitable as she pursues her self-destructive\ncourse.\nTo say that Clifford hasn't tried would be to\ndo the man an injustice. He has dreamed up\ni the entirely fictitious character, Harry York her\nfirst love, who despite all the turmoil, the\nlovers and the tantrums, stays true through\nthick and thin. This gives rise to periodic\nattempts to rescue Frances from whichever\ninstitution her mother has committed her to;\nthis at least gives the film moments of tension\nas they flee the asylum. Mrs Farmer, who has\nalways been the driving force behind Frances,\nwants her cured of that instability in her\ncharacter known as independance and sent\nback to Hollywood to realise all the ambitions\nwhich her mother has always desired for her.\nTo this end she tries to protect Frances from\nherself and get her to conform to the\nHollywood model. There is irony in the way\nthe story unfolds to reveal how she is casually\ncommitted to the living hell of a mental\ninstitution because anyone who doesn't want a... and after\nshowbiz career must be insane. Once\ncommitted she slides rapidly downhill until\nlobotomy is prescribed for her. 'Lobotomy\ngets 'em home' the doctor cheerfully explains\nJessica Lange has been nominated for Best\nActress for her role, and it is indeed a polished,\ncompetent performance, which was obviously\nhighly demanding. Frances Farmer was a highly\nerratic, emotional person and Kim Stanley\nhas been nominated as best supporting actress\nas the ruthless driving mother. The film is\ntouching at times and Jessica Lange is always\nworth\" watching, having the apparently\nfashionable combination of blonde hair and\nbrown eyes (a la Streep). It raises, nagging\nquestions about how we treat people who are\ndifferent; is society so inflexible that we must\nmentally club people into line? Possibly society\nis more caring today, but the fact that it could\nhappen then is disturbing.\nSince she died nearly ten years ago we will\nnever know what Frances Farmer thought\nabout her drama tis ed biography; I think she'd have liked it, it is a warning to the film world\nthat it should not try to crush and humiliate\ntalent which has a great deal to give even if it's ot what the moguls think they want. And it's a warning to us of how we misunderstand those\nwho think along different lines. But really it's all\na bit slow and dull. I was never bored by it, it\njust seemed to need a little extra lite,\nsomething to lift it out of the narrative rut and\nlive a little. If you want a film about sanity and\nmental treatment I'd try One Flew Over the\nCuckoo's Nest, which treats the subject with\nmore humour and yet manages to be a far\nmore moving experience.\nLee Paddon\nFrances before..\n| Page11\n\n"

For this year\nand last we have ;been unable to find three people capable of lasting for\nthe entire year. This has meant that through the Union has coped\nremarkably well under such strain it has not been able to run as well as it\nshould. '\nIt is therefore essential that the candidates returned at this election\nhave the ability' to survive successfully their year in office.\nResidence\nI had hoped to be able to h/ ing to this meeting details of the Lawreys\nReport on Student Residence and residence services. However, at the\ntime of writing I have not seen a copy. If I am in receipt of a copy before\nthe meeting I will attempt to prepare a summary for distribution at this\nmeeting. We would only be able to bring a proposal to the meeting on the\n10th of March at the earliest.\nUFC\nDespite the front page news story in FELIX last week the Union\nis making a strong effort to produce a balanced budget for next year. I am confident that both the major subcommittees and the CCUs will\ncooperate over this matter.\nGravel\nI think the Unio\u00bb-has achieved a significant gain by having its nominee,\nDr John \u00a3t, pc ksi jj clude d in the list of names for the proposed Governors\nWorking Pajty. \u00bbA\"s, such w<> should support the proposed extraction.\nUniversity'Athletics. UnionImperial Cpj^a Union is currently investigating affiliation to this body\nto ensure that ICXs sports clubs are ensured independance from UL U sports clubs in all future competitions.\nDeputy President's Report\nThe major re decoration of the building is now well under way with the\nSenior Common Room and Uppe? Lounge repainted and the Central\nStaircase in its final stages. The new furniture for the Senior Common\nRoom has now arrived, and I hope to buy some new lampshades in the\nnear future to further improve this area.\nThe mens^e han'ging rooms have also been redecorated and together\nwith the 'repaired lockers make this area of the building much more\nacceptable. Unfortunately we still have some security problems in this\narea due to trie carelessness of the users. I am also looking into removing\nsome of the old lockers and putting in an extra bench to increase the\nchanging capacity.\nThere has been demand tor the increased noticeboard space,\nparticularly in prime sites such as tin- .ICR and I have now got four new\nnoticeboards which I hope to persuade Estates to put up on the wall by\nthe STOIC monitor. I am also considering the possibility o!ust na the\nCrush Bar in the JCR more effectively, part icu la'h with je'sa'rv to it's use\nas a storage area. At the time of wr i png i his report it seems likely li will\nbe used to store a cupboard to keep lights and cables in as well as a store\nof rubbish bags and other cleaning materials. This is all subject to\nrefectories allowing us to use this area, which remains to be seen.\nAnother area which is now being extensively investigated is the\nVolleyball Court which has totally inadequate changing facilities and\nthere is also the problem that certain groups appear to have acquired\nkeys to this area over the last few years and are thus using the court\nwithout us or the chemistry security desk knowing about it.

    "content": "IREVIEWSI\nThe National Portrait Gallery was founded\nwith the aim of collecting the likenesses of\nfamous British men and women. The present\nhome of the collection, in St Martin's Place,\nopened in 1896. The building was designed in\nthe style of an Italian palazzo, with an extra\nwing added in 1933, the gift of Lord Duveen.\nThe primary collection is arranged in chronological order, beginning with the Middle Ages\nand Tudors on the top floor. New exhibition\nrooms have recently been constructed in the\nGallery's main building: these are reached via\nthe parquet floors and 'drawing room' setting\nof the Victorian portraits, and are* being\ninaugurated by the exhibit on 'Van Dyck in\nEngland'.\nIn the spring of 1632, Van Dyck arrived in\nLondon. The court of Charles I was then the\nmost sophisticated and glamourous of Europe.\nVan Dyck was 33, the son of a wealthy\nAntwerp silk merchant and the most brilliant\nof Rubens' pupils. He had spent a number of\nyears in Italy and was by all accounts a very\ncharming man\u2014romantically handsome, with\ncosmopolitan manners and wide experience.\nIn addition, Charles I found in Van Dyck an\nartist of international reputation who shared\nhis love of the great Venetian painter, Titian\nJacobean to Carolean\nIn an age when even the best endeavours of\nBR and British Telecom cannot halt the\ncommunication and exchange of ideas within\nan almost worldwide artistic community, it is\nmind-bending to try and appreciate the rate at\nwhich ideas spread in the 17th Century. The\nrediscovery of classical (Greek and Roman)\nart and its reinterpretation in the Renaissance\nmovement, began in Italy in the 15th Century,\nin the 16th Century it crept northwards over\nthe Alps, but did not reach England 'till the\nearly 17th Century: the court of Charles I was\nthe last great Renaissance court to rediscover\n'antique' civilisation, and Van Dyck brought to\nit ideas' from European countries where the\ninitial impact of the Renaissance had been\ndelivered over a century before.\nWALKABOUTLOOKSEE\nby Mobile Optics toe.\nThink of the long gallery of a Jacobean\nhouse \u2014 people it with portraits... staring\nfixedly, standing rigidly, ruffs and skirts stiffly\nstarched, cushions solid as bricks. Now have a look at Van Dyck's portrait of the two Stuart\nbrothers\u2014they are elegantly posed, and\ngorgeously contrasted in gold and blue; curves\nand diagonals link the figures; there is gesture\nand movement and a glance at the spectator.\nHenrietta Maria by Van Dyck\nPlato and St George\nWhilst Van Dyck's sitters are without doubt\nalive, theirs is a very elegant life, in a civilised\nalmost artificial, society.\nIn the tradition of chivalrous courtly love,\nknights are not only warriors, they are also the\nsuitors and slaves of fair ladies. Queen\nHenrietta Maria fused this tradition with\nRenaissance Neo-Platonism, and played the\nrole of romantic heroine, taming the (sensual)\nexcesses of the Stuart court by introducing a cult of courtly love. This mood comes across\nin Van Dyck's portraits of the queen and is\nechoed in portraits of other 'beauteous' ladies:\nthey wear their revealing de colle tes most\ndemurely and have little sense of humour.\nSome of the male sitters are also Romantically\ndressed, tho' many wear contemporary\ncostume or armour. They too appear\ndistinguished and refined\u2014Van Dyck had a gift for ennobling a face and hands\u2014and some\nhave a look of dignified (Renaissance)\nmelancholy.\nAn aristocratic portrait painter\nThe pictures in the National Portrait Gallery\nexhibition have been selected by Sir Oliver\nMillar, Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures and\nthe number one authority on Van Dyck's English period. This is an exhibition of\nbeautiful paintings of gracefully languorous\npeople. At the most culturally enlightened\ncourt in Europe, they had the opportunity to\npatron i sea painter who transformed them\nfrom Jacobean dolls into aristocratic embodiment s of a Romantic-Renaissance ideal. And\nyet, a year after Van Dyck's death, Civil War\nbroke out between King and Parliament and\nwithin ten years regicide had been committed\nand the King's great art collections dispersed\nand sold: the society Van Dyck immortalised\nwas destroyed.\nWhere, When, \u00a3?\n'Van Dyck In England' is at the National\nPortrait Gallery, St Martin's Place, WC2 till 20\nMarch. It's open Mon-Fri 10-5, Sat 10-6, Sun 2-6. Admission is 50p for students, otherwise \u00a31.\nThe Cromwellian\n' Cocktail & Wine Bar\n, 3 Cromwell Rd, SW7\n&\nBistro Vino\n5 Clareville St, SW7\n373 3903\nWe started off at the Cromwellian downing\nmellifluous potions in the sleazy half light. The\nair of Jeevishness was broken for a moment as\nthe early evening imbibe rs gathered by the\ntelevision set to watch the latest cavort i hgs of\nKen and Deirdrie and then resumed, leaving\none witt i a sense that it was Coronation Street\nrather than the cocktail bar which was the\nanachronism.\nThe Cromwellian's Happy Hour lasts from\n6:00 to 9:00pm every night and until closing\ntime on Mondays when a fine selection of\ngarnished, coloured concoctions are slickly\nstirred or shaken and poured at \u00a31.20 a time.\nOut Into the chill night air for a short trudge\nto the Bistro Vino in Clareville Street (close to\nwhere Queen's Gate meets the Old Brompton\nRoad). The Bistro's charm is magnified by the\ncobbled mews in which it stands, as if set down\nby chance.\nInside, in the unadorned can del it snug, we\nwere overcome by gluttonous lunacy.\nWhitebait (80p) followed by a main course dish\nof spaghetti generously soused in rich meaty\nbolognaise (\u00a32.50) followed by Chicken Kiev\n(\u00a33.20) seeping with garlic and ending with\nSorbet. For another deranged combination\u2014\nWhitebait then Veal a la Creme (\u00a33.00)\nfinished off with Mushroom Omlette and chips.\nOthers of us, more restrained, had Prawn\nCocktail (80p), Fillet au Poivre Vert (\u00a33.75)\nfollowed by Profiteroles with chocolate sauce.\nCorn on the Cob (80p) was rather tasteless\nbut the Chicken Kiev made up for it as did the\nTreacle Tart and cream for pudding. Two\nbottles of Vin Vivant (\u00a33.60 each) were the\nchosen accompaniment.\nThe eccentric addiction to main courses was\nless a comment on the size of the portions,\nmore a tribute to the quality of the food.\nService was fast and good humour ed. The bill\ncame to \u00a331.65 for four including two bottles of\nwine and excellent garlic bread (35p) leaving us\nwith sufficient resources for the taxi ride\nhome.\nPage 121 February 25, 1983 FELIX\n\n"

The\nladies also entered a couple of\ncrews who were disappointing\nly beaten.\nThis brings the total number\nof wins for the club this year to\n23 which is by far the highest\nnumber at this stage for many\nyears with the main regatta\nseason still to come.\nThe Boat Club once again\nproved themselves to be one of\nthe top sports clubs in IC by\ntaking three of the top five\nplaces at Henley Four's Head on\nSaturday, and winning all the\ncategories that they had been\nentered for.\nThe race was timed over a2'/4 mile course including the famous\nHenley regatta course, and was\nwon by Leander Club's elite\ncox less four with Imperial's senior A cox less four coming\nIC vs Avery Hill\nA possible victory was thrown\naway in the dying stages of the\nmatch at Avery Hill on Monday\nnight.

Also last week due to a small administrative error, ie a dyslexic match secretary, some\ncompetition cards got mixed up\nand the offending gentleman had\na lot of explaining to do.\nA serious matter has come to\nmy attention this week. It seems\nthat one (or more) potential\nmarksmen are using the effect of\na well-known after shave (splash\nit on all over, eh Tim?) to\nproduce nausea and double\nvision amongst other, more\nsensitive shooters. This very\ndubious practise must stop\nbecause, as a side effect, is is\ncausing members to eat and\ndrink more, resulting in the\ngrowth of beer guts.

The wind filled\nsufficiently to give good team\nracing conditions, and the teams\nwere sufficiently evenly matched\nto make a bit of a fight of it, even\nif, as is almost inevitable, considering the style and modesty of the team, we won!

Until now I have had great difficulty in\nreading these sorts of leaflets,\nwith Jong words in them like\n' m unit iv is m', and 'nook lear dette rent'; and also their complicated fi lios of ical arguments\nfull of political jargon and\ntek n ical terms, which I don't see\nhow I could possibly be expected\nto understand. That was, until\nMonday morning when I had the\nop pur t unity to pick up and read\nthe 'Norning Cloud'.\nNow there are some who\nwould say that we sien se and\ntek no logy students are inc abel of\ncreative and original writing, but\nthe editor of the ' Morning Cloud' has certainly proved\nthem wrong. Did he let himself\nbe tied down to facts, or attempt\nto express a logical argument for\nhis policies? Of course not, for\nhow tedious this would have\nbeen.\nInstead as an argument against 'unilateral is m', we got\ns ut tle in u endo( well it wasn't that s ut tle really, as otherwise it\nwould have been above my\nhead), that these silly women at\nGreenham Common are a load\nof lesbians.\nAnd I'd never have realised\nbefore that these nasty WIST\npeople (in collaboration with the\nChristian Union etc) were out to\ndestroy my Freedom of Choice\nto go and see pornographic\nevents. It's this sort of right that\nmakes one proud to be British. I suppose that WIST must have\nbeen put to it by the KGB. I am shu re that at this rate, the\neditor of the pam ff let will be\nable to look forward to a promising career as a political\ncome nt at or on that respected\njer nal 'the Daily Star'.\nYours\nAnnabel Stogdon\nPhysics\nCopies of this letter have been\nsent to: the wonderfully courageous Mrs M Thatcher and the\nMinister of State for Education\nand Science.\nDear Martin\nA rather cruel and sinister\njoke has been played on our\nmost upright and honourable\nConsoc. There is a foul plot\nafoot to discredit its name.\nThere may even be Russian\nagents holding committee posts.\nFor on Monday 21 Feb I spotted a piece of pro pog and a that tries to undermine, without\nany hesitation to use knee to the\ngroin tactics, our most holy\nConsoc.\nThese are honourable gentle-men, fighters for our freedoms.\nThey deserve all the respect due\nto them. We must stand behind\nthem in their hour of need, we\nmust defend them to the last, we\nwill fight on the beaches....\n'Morning Cloud\u2014 A Conservative Review' is a leaflet that\ntries to give the impression, to\nthe unknowing readers, that\nConsoc members are ignorant,\nthoughtless, prejudiced bloody\ntwits with nothing better to do\nthan waste money, effort and\ntime in producing an insulting\nand mindless piece of garbage.\nOf course this is very, very far\nfrom the truth. It is libellous and\nindeed contemptible. The moral\nand intellectual standards of\nConsoc members are in direct\ncontrast with this discrediting\nbog paper. These are honourable\ngentlemen, following in the\nfootsteps of so many great\nleaders.\nWe must defend this great\nbastion of our Empire, we must\nsave this institution from the\nReds. We must stop this before\nit is too late.\nLong live our great leader! Up\nMagaret Thatcher.\nYours sincerely\nMichael P.

That is what will happen\nunless at least 25% of full union\nmembers vote in each sabbatical\nelection.\nSuch a requirement has\nnothing to do with either\ndemocracy or common sense. I urge all those who wish to avoid\nthis situation arising to support\nmy motion to amend the Voting\nSchedule at the next U GM. Yours faithfully\nJ.P. Stanley\nDear Martin\nFELIX really does scent to he\nfulfilling its aim of bringing real\nnews to its readership these days.\nIt was certainly news to nie to\nfind that I am to be STOlC's Hon Sec next year, as stated in\nyour 'Below The Belt' column\nlast week. I 'll grant you the fact\nthat I was standing, uncontested,\nfor this post when the 'report'\nwas written but. since then,\nanother candidate (eoin eS den tally, a regular visitor to the\nFELIX Office) has also been\nproposed.\nAnother thing: that statement\nabout the STOIC committee\nposts having been settled last\nChristmas\u2014the words were\ntaken right out of my mouth...\nbefore I had the chance to utter\nthem myself. Honestly, Martin,\ndo you always use smear campaigners as informants? It would\nhave been an incredibly stupid\nstatement to make, as in an\nelectorate the size of STOIC's membership, any form of vote\nfiddling that this action could\nentail would be easily detected.\nThe article went on to implicate the returning officer,\nLawrence Windley, in activities\nlikely to bias the election results.\nReference was made to the fact\nthat he has stipulated three\nsecond ers for each candidate (as\nin previous years) as opposed to\nthe constitutional two. Does this\nreally matter? If a candidate\ncan't find three people to second\nhim/her, I can't see that it's really worth his/her time standing for a post.\nYour error coefficient was\nquite impressive in the other\nSTOIC article too, but I'm sure\nthat you'114i ear more about that\nfrom other sources.\nYours sincerely\nDonal Quigley\nThe Need\nFor Religion\nDear Editor\nRoger Kingdon's 'The Need\nFor Religion' presents religion\nas a kind of moral drug which is\nthe only cure for the 'world's problems'\u2014be they personal \u2022\n(lack of self-confidence), political (world government), economic or social. Moreover, the\ndrug comes in various forms\n(pills, injections, ointments...).\nYou can make your choice in\nThe Drugstore of Religions\nwhich is set up to solve the\nproblems of the future!\nTo choose our beliefs with the\naim to further our future seems\nto me an obvious act of self-deception. This notion of religion as a means to survival\nand establishment of a future\nUtopian world ignores the claim\nof religion to represent objective\ntruth and a complete life trans-action. It simply reduces religion\nto a psychological strategy for\nlacing life. Our beliefs can have a valid foundation only if they are\nmotivated by a desire for truth\nand understanding our relationship with the Creator.\nYours\nF Deravi\nI Won't Stand For It\nDear Martin\nI am writing to explain my\ndecision not to stand for ICU President this year. The decision,\nlet me assure you, has been very\ndifficult indeed. There are many\nthings I would have lil ced to\nhave set in motion next year to\ntry and improve the service the\nunion provides and to improve\nthe often barren social life at IC.\nAs the editor of Guildshit put it,\nI have students' interests at\nheart.\nThe reasons for deciding\nagainst standing I must confess\nare purely selfish.I do not feel I ought to waste another year (I took one out between school and\nIC) before embarking on a career. The experience, I have\nbeen assured, though useful,\nwould in my situation be largely\nsuperfluous. On top of this is the\nfact that it may even be detrimental to my career, for though IC\nUnion is very different from\nmost student unions many\npeople in industry do not draw\nthe distinction between student\nand trade unions and I might\npossibly be held up by this\nlabelling.\nI would like to express my\nthanks to all those who have\nencouraged me to run for\npresident and apologise if I have\nlet anybody down through my\ndecision. Finally, to the successful candidate I extend my best\nwishes for what will without\ndoubt be a very difficult year\nahead, and wish him or her the\nbest of luck.\nYours sincerely\nSimon Rodan\nPage 61 I February 25, 19831 I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "CCI-II\nAlgebraic Numbers\nThis week's puzzle, due to my unbelievable\napathy, is from Scaramouche. It's one of many\nvariants on a simple idea for a puzzle: all you\nhave to do is construct an expression which is\nidentically equal to four, using only three n's( where n represents a digit greater than 0 and\nless than 10). For instance,\nnn+nn EE for the most expressions.\nLast Week's Solution\nCocktails for Six\nOnly seven entries for this, which surprised me\nas it was an easy puzzle. The winner was\nLeann Jones of Maths 2, who can collect her\n\u00a35 cheque from the FELIX Office after 1:30pm on Monday (and I promise it will be ready this\ntime!). The lie was that Mandy said 'Cuddles\nBarnett is more expensive than Chairman's Decision'. My apologies to the young lady on\nwhom the puzzle was based.\n(here <n represents the number -nnn...=n/9) So you can construct an expression which is\nidentically 4?\nAlso, there's a Jingles haircut voucher for\nthe person who can supply the most number\nof digits in the same way.\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by 1:00pm Wednesday. \u00a35 from\nMend-a Bike for a randomly selected correct\nentry, and a free h cW cut voucher from Jingles\nAngling Corner\nThis is one of my father's puzzles, and is\nremarkable in that, while it is a difficult puzzle,\nI don't think it requires anything more than O Level maths to do it.\nI shall, totally arbitrarily, refer to an angle\nwhich is part of a right angled triangle with\ninteger sides (ie either angle of a3,4,5 or a5,12,13 triangle) as a right acute angle. Now, if\nyou create a new angle from any integer\nmultiple of any number of right acute angles\n(added or subtracted), you create a new one.\nFor instance, if you take 53.130\u00b0 (one of the\nangles from a3,4,5 triangle) and add it to\n22.620\u00b0 (one of the angles from a5,12,13 triangle) you get 75.750\u00b0, one of the angles\nfrom a16,63,65 triangle. Can you prove that\nthis is always the case?\nThe Undergraduate and the Porters\nWell, I did tell you it was difficult, though only\none person seemed to believe me. Perola was\nthe only person to come close; after this point I think you need to be a mathematician to go\nany further. The scene so far; to escape means\nto leave the lawn, and pretend (assume!) that\nthere is a path running around the lawn upon\nwhich the porters may move.\nThe porters must obviously be considered\nas points, and if there is any finite number of\nporters, the undergraduate can run up to the\nedge and dodge the porters easily, since he\ncan run on a smaller radius than them, and\nhence overtake them. We therefore need an\ninfinity of porters, and while a porter placed at\nevery real point of the circle can obviously stop\nthe undergraduate escaping, can a porter at\nevery rational point?\nI think people are interested in this kind of puzzle; I got more answers handed in to this than to\n'Cocktails for Six', so I shall continue the\nseries. Unfortunately there was only one even\nnearly correct answer (most people favouring\nthree porters).\nCiMDT FLOWERS111 Br\\NC\u00a3KS\nUNION BUILDING\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE SW7\n\u00a31-00 (15p** ANCE) march\n4tb Thurs March 3 5:30-7:00\nFree!

Sabbaticals cost\nthe Union something over\n\u00a320,000 aye a i. and if you want\nto make sure this money is well\nspent, it is essential that you get\ninformed on the aptitude of the\nvarious candidates before you\nEDITORIAL\nvote.

A recent\nincident shows that even Andy\nhimself may be losing faith in his\ncredibility:\nThe FELIX Editor is generally happy to allow Union Officers space in the Union\nnewspaper, and so when Andy\nasked Martin for a half page, the\nrequest was gladly granted.\nMartin was rather surprised,\nthough, to see Andy filling the\nallotted space not with a report,\nas is customary, but with a supposedly humorous quiz. And\nhe was decidedly put out to see it\nsigned pseudonymously and\nentitled 'The FELIX Quiz'. Consequently he told Andy that\nit would be changed to 'The Hon\nSee's Quiz'. Apparently he took\n::.. ;. jn ke, because on Friday\nnie irn inga white-faced Andy\nGrimshaw burst into the FELIX Office brandishing a copy of the\nquiz. 'How dare you put my\nname to this?' he screamed.\n'Now no one will read it!'\nThis week he has been getting\nworked up over the other half of\nhis dual job, that of returning\nofficer. He has decided, with his\nnormal excess concern for trivia,\nto stamp out with ruthless\nde'ern i nation any possibility of\nan \"unfair advantage' for any\ncandidate, or even any potential\ncandidate, though how he\npresumes t<> know who will or\nwon't stand I can't imagine.

So when Nick\nwrote a letter to FELIX, Andy\nwas most concerned lest Nick\nshould accrue some advantage\nover his opponents oy this; he\neven suggested that we should\nrefuse to print the letter, or at\nleast append the names of the\nothers who are standing for any\npost Nick might p ossi Hy be\nconsidering stand in s? for.\nNick seized on his change for\nrevenge on Tuesday afternoon.\nAs usual, Exec News had\narrived at the FELIX Office too\nlate for the copy deadline (one of\nthe reasons Mary Freeman was\nsacked, inc'dental lv la nH<;n it\nfell to Mr Grimwash to prepare\nthe artwork. Unfortunately he\nwas too busy, and so delegated\nthe job to a reluctant Nick Pyne\nwho, since he is a final year\nstudent who sits on numerous\nUnion co mrt 'tte'** \" iHr \"ii\u00ab only\nthree job interviews this week, has\nmuch more time than a sabbatical officer who is paid the\nequivalent of \u00a36,000 a year to\nfind time for such things. Nick\ndid the job and asked Andy to\nproof-read it. Andy was too\nbusy even for this, and so it was\nnot until five thousand Exec\nNewses had been printed ih.il he\nsaw to his horror the \u2022\n< V 'Vote Nick Pync for H..,ora ry February 25,19831\nSecretary' taking up half of the\nback page. His fury was gratifying to behold, particularly since\nit was aggravated when the\nFELIX staff refused to be\nperturbed, and didn't even\nconsider this tactic unfair at all.\nWhat Andy didn't realise (and\nwon't realise until he reads this)\nis that four thousand nine\nhundred and ninety four Exec\nNewses have a totally innocuous\nspace filler on the back page, and\nprecisely six were specially\nprinted with the inflammatory\nadvertisement, just to annoy our\nrather petty Honorary Secretary.\nNick Pyne told me* before the\nstart of term that he had decided\nnot to stand for a sabbatical\npost. I wonder if the election\nrules imply that I should name\nall others who are also not\nstanding.\nAND WHY do you suppose\nAndy Grimwash was too busy to\nproduce Exec News? What vital\nappointment kept him and\nStephen Goulder away from the\nUnion Office all Wednesday\nafternoon? Union staff have\nrefused to tell, so I shall: They\nwere moonlighting, earning \u00a318\neach serving food to delegates at\na meeting in the Albert Hall.\nApparently the staff, knowing\nthat there are no lectures at IC\non Wednesday afternoons, had\nasked the Union if any students\nwould be willing to supplement\ntheir grants for an afternoon's work. Messrs Gould er and\nGrimshaw, always keen to pick\nup some extra cash on the side,\ngenerously volunteered their\nown services for the job. Mr Gouder later spoke of how he\nhad enjoyed the experience.\nThis certainly pays better than\nbeing a sabbatical,' he chortled.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HI Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "IREVIEWSI\nGood God\nMessiah by Martin Sherman, directed by\nRonald Eyre, Aldwych Theatre.\nRonald Eyre's production of Messiah which\nhas transferred to the Aldwych Theatre after a highly acclaimed run at the Hampstead\nTheatre, is a tragic but heart-warming homage\nto the human condition. In just two hours,\nthemes of life and death, religion and humanity\nand spirituality and hedonism are tackled\u2014\nthemes rarely approached on the contemporary stage. It is indeed a notable achievement\nfor the commer ici al theatre.\nMessiah is based on fact. It is set in the\nseventeenth century, in Poland. A Jewish\nfamily travels from Poland to Turkey swept\nalong by the belief that the Messiah has come.\nPoland harbour ed an enormous population at\nthe time, but ten years of brutal fighting with\nthe Ukranian Cossacks decimated the\npopulation. The ravished Jewish community\nbecame obsessed with visions of salvation.\nThe Kabbalah, the mystical interpretation of\nthe scriptures became a driving force,\ncreating a sense of near-certainty that the\nMessiah would finally come.\nMaureen Lipman plays Rachel, the central\ncharacter. Poor in wealth but not in heart she\nmarries an old man, Reb Ellis, played by Clive\nSwift. A young fanatic, Asher, played by Jack\nKlaff, brings in word of the arrival of the\nMessiah. People go mad. The new Messiah,\nSabbatai Sevi, renounces worldly goods and\nReb thus goes about selling everything to the\nhorror of his wife. He believes in the basis of\nscriptural evidence, that he can fi y to\nJerusalem. He climbs to the top of his\nhouse...and plunges to his death (there is a lot\nof this dry humour in the play). Rachel\nbefriends Asher and with other members of\nthe household they go to Poland to seek out\nthe Messiah. Sabbatai Sevi, in the end, turns\nout to be a false god. But the climax of the play\nfollows after this.\nMartin Sherman has drawn the character\nRachel with great confidence. We are\npresented throughout the play with a feminine\nview of life and a feminine view of religion.\nAmong the issues covered, a particularly strong\none to come out of the evening is the problem\nof trials and hardships in life. How can there be\na so-called benign God when there is so much\nfamine, destruction, murder and natural\ndisaster in the world? This is often asked and is\na good question. But what if these troubles and\nsufferings are a necessary part of the world?\nWhat if they are a necessary part of the human\nJot? The 'path of life' comes up against big\nobstacles like any other path and a path\nwouldn't be a true path, and a path worth\nforging if it didn't negotiate obstacles at some\ntime or other thereby affording a passage for\nthe traveller. Byron, in his Don Juan, says\n'Adversity is the first path to Truth'. Luigi\nPirandello, in Six Characters in Search of an\nAuthor, expands a little: 'Man never reasons\nso much and becomes so introspective as\nwhen he suffers: since he is anxious to get to\nthe cause of his sufferings, to learn who has\nproduced them and whether it is just or unjust\nthat he should have to bear them.' Suffering\ncauses us to think and to think deeply.\nt ne pi ay10n iucn recommended. Maureen\nLipman and Clive Swift give superb per-form ances. The production is complemented\nby excellent stage designs and music; there is\ninstantaneous evocations of a ship at sea, an\ninterior of a house and \"fur kish bazaar.\nMaureen Lipman and Matyeiok Gibbs in 'Messiah'\nNirk l Cordon\nBleugh\nThis week I intend to demonstrate the\nversatility and appeal of pizzas.\nAll pizzas need a b.ase and I prefer to use\nwhole meal bread, for which you will, need\nyeast, whole meal flour and some sugar, salt\nand a little oil or butter. Follow the instructions\nfor the yeast you buy to make up the solution\nand leave it in a warm place for fifteen minutes.\nStir it into the flour to make a dough and\nknead well. Leave it to rise for half an hour and\nthen press if firmly into a well-oiled tin. While\nthe dough is rising, you can be making the\ntoppings.\nThe mainstay of pizzas is Italian tinned\ntomatoes. For a pleasant change, make\nscrambled eggs from two eggs and stir in a cup\nof tinned tomatoes. Spread this mixture thick y over the pizza base. Garnish with gooseberries\nand bake for fifteen minutes at 550\u00b0F. Remove\nfrom the oven, cover completely with\nmeringue and moz are lla cheese mixture and\nreturn to the oven until just brown and\nbubbling. Serve immediately.\nAlternatively, take two bananas and a cup of\ntomatoes and combine thoroughly in a blender. Add a small amount of cooking sherry\nand some vinaigrette. Spread the base with\nBovril and then cover with mixture. Garnish\nwith slices of beetroot, anchovies and one\npineapple ring in the middle. Bake as before.\nFinally, a very special and very different\npizza. Cook y4 lb of mince thoroughly. Mix\nwith aspic and mint sauce and leave to set.\nBlend a cup of stewed rhubarb with a cup of\ntomato and some sour cream. Spread over the\npizza, cover with grated Danish Blue and bake\nas before. Cut the aspic into cubes and garnish\nthe pizza quickly with these. Serve before it\nmelts.\nAll pizzas can be served with side salads or\njacket potatoes with garlic butter icing. For a light dessert to follow, serve spinach\ncheesecake garnished with chocolate flake and\nvii a tea carrot.\nFELIXI February 2 5 , 19831\nBut I Always\nLie\nWhat is The Name Of This Book? by\nRaymond Smullyan, published by Pelican\nBooks.\nAre you interested enough in logic to realise\nthat the headline above this review is not a paradox? When you see logic puzzles, do you\ngive them anything more than a brief scan? If\nso then this book is for you. It is, in fact, a fine\ncoffee table book\u2014you can scan through odd\npages or read whole sections, and still be\namused or fascinated by the author's ingenious twisting of what at first seems a fairly\nsimple subject.\nThe book is divided into several chapters\nand, broadly speaking, into two sections. The\nfirst section deals with problems for you to\nsolve and after about twenty questions the\nanswers are printed, in a completely different\ntypeface (a good idea\u2014one of the great\nproblems that I have found with most puzzle\nbooks is that the answers are not differentiated\nclearly enough from the problems). The book\nopens with a nice set of paradoxes, simple\npuzzles, 'lateral thinking' puzzles, and\nstraightforward tricks. It then goes on to\ndevelop the problems of people who either\nalways tell the truth or always lie. Much of this\nsection is involved with gradually complicating\nthis idea, firstly onto normal people who say\nwhat they please, then to people who lie on\nsome days of the week and not on others. One\nof the rr.ure challenging aspects of the book is\nits 'find as tata ment such that....' questions\nsuch as, given that someone knows you either\nalways tell me truth of always lie, convince\nthem that you are rich (the answer is either to\nsay that you are a poor liar or not a rich truth\nteller\u2014I leave the reason in ig to you). Thus\nmany ideas are developed.\nThe book then moves onto stories, and the\ndifficulty is twisted up a notch\u2014we visit the\ncontinued on page 14\n\u2022 HH BH HH HH MH MH Page13 "

Naturally inspired\nby such a god-like presence, the\nteam won 16-3. This score\nincluded two tries, neither of\nwhich was finished by diseased\nDave Magoo, though it was\nnoted that QM C, forewarned of\nDave's a ff li cation, wouldn't go\nnear him.\nNotable performances came\nfrom Mark 'the boot' Hudson,\nwho successfully put the ball\ninto orbit from various angles on\nthe pitch, and Mickey Winsor,\nwho, owing to an accident\ninvolving a jar of vase line before\nthe game dropped the ball every\ntime it came his way. (Except\nwhen he scored the first try.)\nThanks are due to Doug Kelly, who refereed under very\ndifficult circumstances (he didn't know the rules).\nAfter the game, the team\nretired to the bar for a pint of\norange squash before returning\nhome amid ci res of 'more\nhor licks', 'less beer' 'more\nproblem sheets', 'less curry' in\norder to do a good evening's work and thereby get better\ndegrees.

Let me\nstress that we are not at all\ndiscriminatory, in fact anyone\nwith slightly feminine tendencies\ncan play.

    "content": "-if\nLex ers to fee\nEdit j oi\nSick Bay\nSavings\nDear Martin\nBefore everyone rushes for\ntheir medical insurance refund,\nafter being incited to do so by\nMessrs. Nathan and TrevorJones, 1 would like to put\nforward a few points.\nAs I understand from the\nlenght y discussions last year on\nthe compulsory insurance sch-e me, it was found to be the best\nway of saving the sick bay which\nwas having financial difficulties\ndue to withdrawal of College\nfunds. The voluntary insurance\ncould not provide enough\nmoney to finance the sick bay.\nThe sick bay is a vital part of\nthe services offered by the health\ncentre and is very necessary in\nthe University situation.\nThere are many reasons why\nstudents use the sick bay. For\nexample those catching infectious viruses e.g. chicken pox, can\nbe close to college (and lectures\ntutors etc) instead of going\nhome. If this occurs during the\nexam period, as happened in my\ncase last year, it is possible to\ntake exams in the sick bay. These\nfacilities are free for those with\nthe medical insurance (I think it\ncosts about \u00a34-\u00a36 per day to\nkeep someone in the sick bay).\nDuring the Exam period last\nyear there was a high turnover of\npeople in the sick bay. So I don't think the number of students\nusing it is very small.\nThe idea to just make the\nscheme compulsory to Hall and\nHouse residents was because it\nwas impossible to implement in\nany other way and as college is\ntrying to let everyone have a year\nin college, then there will be\nvery few who do not pay.\nAs it is impossible to predict\nwhether or not illness will strike\nin the 3 years at college, it is\nadvantageous to have the\nmedical insurance. For the sick\nbay to survive, the compulsory\nmedical insurance must also\nsurvive. If not, then there will be\nmany students who will have\ntheir studies seriously impaired\nby illness.\nYours sincerely\nRebecca May\nDear Martin,\n\u2022 With elections approaching it\nis somewhat of a tradition for\nsabbatical candidates to do\neverything possible to associate\nthemselves with the body of\nstudent opinion. This year,\nhowever, has seen a letter to\nFELIX full of such utter hogwash as we have never before\nhad to endure. I refer, of course,\nto Phil Nathan's letter regarding\nthe \u00a312 levy raised this year on\nhall bills under the heading\n'Health Centre'.\nWe see Mr Nathan suggesting\nthat we are contributing to a 'private health scheme' which is\n'doubtful in law', that this\nshould be the 'responsibility of\nall students' etc etc.\nMay I now point out some of\nthe facts. The levy of \u00a312 is to\ncover the provision of a sick bay\n\u2014 the health centre as a whole\nhas always been (and will continue to be) an NHS facility.\nThe scheme worked out is as fair\nas possible \u2014 once set up (over a. three year period) then only j those who spend no time in ;\nCollege ac como dati on( princip- ,\nally those who live at home and\nconsequently have no need for\nthe sick bay) will not be covered\nso yes all students are (or will be)\npaying for it.\nWhat, though, is the alter-native? The UGC has specifically stated that such things\nshould not be funded by the\ncolleges. So perhaps only those\nwho use the sick bay should pay?\nTough luck \u2014 estimates run as\nhigh as \u00a320 per night even to get\nnear to breaking even, and very\nsoon, I'm sure, Mr Nathan\nwould complain about charges\non that scale!\nFinally, a few closing ideas.\nIn Mr Nathan's letter we see\n(though it is well hidden) the\nimplicit point that the author\nwould rather see the sick bay\nclose than have a pitiful \u00a312 levy\nto keep it open. Surely this\nsmacks of hypocrisy \u2014 weren't the very same people decrying\nthe removal of the linen service\nso very recently? And for those\nof you demanding your \u00a312\nback, I can only say I hope that\nyou have to spend a few days in\nthe sick bay at full cost.\nThe sick bay represents without\na doubt a valuable and necessary\nfacility. Surely it's worth (less\nthan) one pint every three weeks\nto be covered for your whole\ncourse?\nYou>:>\nNick Pyne\nPics Nicked\nDear Martin\nAren't there some small-minded people around?\nThe Gliding Club set up three\ndisplay-boards on Saturday for a week long 'exhibition' on Level 2\nin Sherfield. On Monday morning we came in to find:\na) the boards have been\nmoved downstairs to Level 1 (ho,\nho, very funny\u2014yes even the\nGliding Club can take a practical joke).\nb) two of the best photographs (poster-size) are missing,\npresumably stolen.\nThose photographs were\nkindly lent to the club for the\nexhibition by individuals\u2014what\ndo we say to them now? And what use are they? Gliding Club\nmembers get their kick oui J \u00bb\nflying, while presumably nonmembers are not interested in\ngliders or gliding (everyone is\nwelcome to have a go, if they are\ninterested). I understand there\nare some very good poster shoos\naround.\nI trust those petty pilferers are\nnot members of College, but if\nthey are perhaps they could\nreturn the photographs to where\nthey came from and we can\nforget the whole matter\nYours sincerely\nAnn Dziwior\nCaptain of Gliding Club\nPS: What were the security\nguards doing while all this was\ngoing on?\nFirearms\nSir\nAs a member of IC Rifle and\nPistol Club, I would like to make\nit clear that the incident reported\nlast week, regarding the arrest of\nseveral IC students on a firearms\ncharge, was in no way connected\nwith ICRPC. The three students\nnamed are not members of the\nclub and will not be encouraged\nto join, as their ir resp or.: M: Jc\nactions can only be detrimental\nto the club. We rely on good\nrelations with the Police for the\nissue of Firearms Certificates,\netc and any such incident will\nreflect badly on us.\nYours faithfully\nGary J. Smith\nOfficial\nVandalism\nDear Sir\nLast Saturday morning the\ndialling mechanism was 'rem-ove d' from the switchboard of\nthe Sovereign Hotel. According\nto witnesses, this was carried out\nby the warden of the Fremantle\nHotel who is believed to hold a similar sinecure in the Sovereign.\nNone of the Sovereign's res-idents, including our sub-warden, were consulted about\nthis. I was told, incidentally, that\nthe Fremantle's dialling mechanism was recently vandalised.\nI should point out that\nalthough the dialling mechanism\nwas not in use at the Sovereign,\nit is not wholly unlikely that\nSovereign residents will be\nrequired to make good the loss\nof t ne mechanism from their\ndamage deposit. Furthermore,\nlest it be uncommon knowledge\nin some circles, I should mention\nthat removal or tampering with\ntelephone equipment by those\nnot authorised to do so constitutes a public offence. Under\nthe circumstances, I feel that\nsome explanation from Mr. Walker would not be amiss.\nYours faithfully\nCreigh McNeil\nRag a Drag?\nDear Sir\nSpeaking as the only couple to\nattend the 'Rag and Drag' Disco\nlast Saturday actually in drag,\nwe are disgusted at the total\napathy of the students at this\nCollege. Since 'Rag and Drag' is\nthe opening event of Rag Week,\nit would have been reasonable to\nexpect more than 10 paying IC\nstudents to attend.\nIt isa pity that we cannot\nmirror the enthusiasm of Manchester University students,\n(notably Rag Race Team no 18),\nwho, despite having hitched here\nfrom Coventry earlier that day,\nstill managed to enter into the\nspirit of the event by turning up\nin drag.\nIf the remainder of Rag Week\nis as poorly supported as this, it\nis obvious that this College no\nlonger has any interest in Rag.\nPerhaps we should abandon Rag\nWeek altogether?\nYours faithfully\nAnn Heinson\nDavid Watson\nMore letters on pag t f> Page 41 February 25, 19831 I FELIX\n\n"

ICU Honorary\nSecretary, Andy Grimshaw,\nimposed the ban because in his\nopinion 'Morning Cloud' contained material offensive to\nseveral minorities in College.\nOn Monday February 14, Mr Grimshaw saw the magazine in\nthe FELIX Office where it was\nbeing prepared for circulation\naround the College. At that\nevening's Council meeting, a motion was passed extending the\npublicity rules concerning posters to all forms of publicity,\nincluding leaflet distribution,\nand Mr Grim shaw then informed the Council that under\nthe new rules 'Morning Cloud'\nwould be banned. No objection\nwas made, despite the presence\nof Paul Simi on, Editor of\n'Morning Cloud', on Council.\nMartin S Taylor, manager of\nthe Union Print Unit, expressed\nhis tj rp rise that he was not\ninformed of the decision since at\nthe time of th; Council meeting\nthe leaflets had not been printed.\nConservative Society could have\nsaved themselves about \u00a315 in\nprinting costs if Mr Simion had\nstopped the order.\nMr Simion had expressed the\ndesire to go 'over the top' with\nthis year's publication, and\nopinion throughout the Union\nseems to be that he has done so,\nespecially in attacks on WIST\nand the C ND. Under the existing publicity\nrui o, any material for publication has to meet with the\napproval of the Union Publicity\nOfficer or Hon Sec, but blanket\napproval is normally given\nunless something is obviously\noffensive.

The report also urges\nCollege to discontinue its subsidy\nof residences, which, informed\nsources say, could double rents\nwithin two years.\nSpecific recommendations for\nthe Halls of Residence are that\nWeeks Hall be made postgraduate only; that Linstead\nshould be made into a full\ncatering ii ali where residents\nwould have to pay for two meals\na day and three at weekends, and\nthat guest rooms should be used\nas regular student rooms where\npossible. The number of security\nguards in ?rinc e's Gardens (the\ncomplex of Week., Li^stead,\nSouthside and Garden* Halls)\nshould be reduced from four to\ntwo, whose salaries would come\nfrom rents, and that there should\nbe no day-time messengers in\nWeeks, Garden or Linstead\nHa:::. TJ\u00ab\u00a3 linen service should\nbe reinstated next year if\ndemand is high enough, and the\ncost of Hall laundry facilities\nwould be increased in line with\nthe price of the Central Launderette when it is installed.\nMr Lauwerys, who is a Senior\nAssistant Secretary in Administration, was commissioned by\nCollege Secretary John Smith to\nproduce the report, but nearly\nhalf of the fifty-eight recommendations in the ninety-page\nreport are for further enquiries\nand investigations iru^, specific\npoints to be carried out. The\nmajor policy recommendations\nare that 125 new places in\nCollege accommodation be\nfound by 1985 to ensure places\nfor all new undergraduate and\npostgraduate students; allocations to re-applicant, welfare,\nUnion and medical places would\nbe cut.\nThe report also recommends\nthat (subject to a proposal from\nthe Estates Secretary) the\nstandard of accommodation at\nthe student houses in Evelyn\nGardens be raised. Beyond this,\nthe Houses receive little specific\nattention in the report. What\ndoes receive space, however, is\nthe Summer Letting Scheme and\nthe use of Linstead Hall as a conference centre; conference\nfacilities should be extended,\nwith the prime object being\nincome rather than the convenience of College or students.\nStudents working on the Summer Letting Scheme would be\nemployed only if they were\nwilling to work overtime when\nrequired.\nMost controversial are Mr Lauwerys' plans for increased\ncentralisation of the system, with\na smaller number of Wardens\nand Sub-Wardens responsible to\na Residential Services Manager,\nwho Mr Lauwerys recommends\ncontinued on page 3\nJulia Adamson and Debbie Bailey\nat Mines Dirty Disco.\nOnly one bed and a Waitrose trolley containing a sleeping bag turned\nup for the Rag Bed Race on Saturday.\nI Friday, February 25,19831 I Free!\n\n"

    "content": "continued from page 13\nisland of zombies, where questions are only\nanswered by 'BaP and 'Da', one of which\nmeans yes, and one of which means no. Then\nwe take a trip into Transylvania, which is\npeopled by humans and vampires, both of\nwhich are split up into sane and insane, to find\nout whether Dracula is alive. We then reach\nthe climax of the first section, as we visit\nDracula's castle where the Transylvanians\nanswer only with 'Bai' or 'Da'. Can you\nconstruct a sentence which will find out if\nDracula is alive? What is the Unifying\nPrinciple? All this, and much more, will\nbe answered in 'What Is The Name Of This\nBook?'\nRaymond Smullyan then takes us onto the\nsecond section. He opens with dozens (far too\nmany in fact) of anecdotes more or less about\nlogic. I felt puzzled\u2014what is the purpose of\nthese stories? Perhaps it was to introduce a bit\nof light relief so that even if you didn't have the\nstamina to attempt any of the questions, you\nwouldn't look upon the book as a complete\nwaste of money. Or is it so that you will be\nbetter fortified to face the rest of the book?\nWhatever the reason, you need to be very\ninterested in logic to read most of the\nremainder. From here on, as they say, the\ngoing gets heavy.\nAfter- showing how to prove anything,\nSmullyan then shows why he believes\nstatements such as ' This statement is false'\nare not logically ad miss able. His reasoning,\nalthough well put, requires a clear mind to\nunderstand, explain or an ply. After clearing up\na few more paradoxes, he reaches the summit\nof the book\u2014a slightly simplified version of\nGodel's Incompleteness Theorem. This, in the\nform he gives it, says that for a wide variety of\nmathematical systems, under a certain\nreasonable assumption about the system,\nthere must be a statement which is neither\nprovable nor d is provable in the system, no\nmatter how many axioms you assume.\nIn spite of the difficulty of this subject, the\nauthor handles it very well and makes it\nentertaining to read. Indeed, the first thing to\nstrike me about the book was its great\nreadability. I found myself reading the\nproblems without even trying them, simply to\nfind out whether Dracula was still alive and\nwhy there is something instead of nothing! If\nyou are interested in logic, then I urge you\nto buy this book. Me?

That poverty, unemployment and starvation are not caused solely by\nnatural disaster, but also by oppressive international social and economic\nsystems.\n2.

That for real development to occur, the power of the multinational\ncorporations, which are a formidable economic and political force, must be\ncurbed. All multinationals must be made subject to an international planning\nagreement, opening up their books and inner workings to democratic control.\n2. And is not, and cannot be political. And should be used to support\nprojects, movements and governments committed to ensuring economic and\npolitical power for the poorest.\n3. That the government should denounce aggressive and anti-developmental foreign policy, whilst building positive relations with\ngovernments which eradicate poverty at grass roots level.\n4. Our educational system does not equip us to examine issues of power in\nthe context of North-South relations, nor does it encourage us to examine our\nrole in relation to the structures that cause and perpetuate underdevelopment.\n5. Charity can only alleviate suffering; alone it can never tackle the causes.\nHence the need for a progressive aid programme.\nICU Instructs:\n1. That the WUS project be reinstated, and help be given to organise and\nsupport progressive fundraising events, such as Third World First's AntiPoverty Action campaign.\n2. To write to all local MPs and the Foreign Office, demanding the\nimmediate end to trade, arms SQ s and political recognition of repressive\nregimes.\n3. For a letter to be sent to the Overseas Development Administration, all\nlocal MPs and the Foreign Office, saying:\na) British aid should concentrate on the poorest countries. If it goes\nelsewhere, it must be in ways which directly raise the incomes and economic\npower of the poorest groups.\nb) The government should appoint an independent group of academics\nand voluntary staff with overseas experience to develop practical criteria for\ndirecting aid to the poorest countries. Commercial and diplomatic sector\nconcerns should not distort the distribution of funds.\nc) To create a larger fieldwork network to indent if y and monitor\nprojects staffed by people well acquainted with local needs and interests.\nd) The government should channel more aid without strings attached\nthrough the more progressive voluntary agencies. However, agencies should\nnot be made dependent on government funding.\ne) The Overseas Development Agency should be given more autonomy\nfrom political pressure by taking it out of the foreign office and reinstating its\nindependent status.\nf) The Aid Trade Provision should be abolished as it only benefits private\nindustry.\ng) The Development Education fund should be reinstated.\nVoting Schedule Ammendment\nDelete 14\nProposed by: J.P. Stanley\nMotion on Student Residence\nProposed by: P Simion\nSeconded by: KC Poon\nICU Notes:\n1. The demand for reasonably priced accommodation near College.\n2. The acquisition of the Fremantle and Sovereign Hotels.\n3. Goulder's election pledge to \"increase the standard of Head Tenancy\naccommodation.\"\n4. The recent list of priorities in selecting students for places in Halls and\nHouses.\n5. The composition of SRC.\nICU Believes:\n1. That extra places in residence for any category of students must not be\nfound at the expense of any other category.\n2. That the search for and acquisition of Head Tenancies and other\nresidences in the vicinity of College must be a priority for College and ICU.\n3. That ICU and students in general are not fully represented on SRC.\nICU Instructs:\n1. The Exec to inform College of this motion.\n2. The Exec to maintain constant pressure on College in order that the\ntotal number of residences in the vicinity of College is increased.\n3. The Exec and ICU Council to study the composition and \u2022ff ect ive ness of\nSRC and other committees that concern residences.\n4. The president to campaign for increased student representation on SRC.\nMotion on Student Loans\nProposer: P Nathan (IC Liberals)\nSeconder: P Riley (supported by the IC Left Alliance)\nICU Notes:\n1. The strong possibility that the present government will include in its\nmanifesto for the next general election, a promise to introduce a system of\nloans for both undergraduates and postgraduates in higher education\n2. That a loans scheme will:\na) saddle undergraduates with debts of more than \u00a33.000 on graduation\nin the case of mixed loans/grant scheme and more than \u00a36,000 if solely a loans scheme.\nb) saddle postgraduates with debts which in many cases could be more\nthan \u00a310,000.\n3. Graduate unemployment is at its highest level since the war.\nICU Believes:\n1. That a loans scheme will:\na) prove a disincentive for students wishing to enter higher education,\nespecially those from poorer homes, and will be another step towards a divided society in which higher education is a preserve of the wealthy.\nb) produce distortions in the range of subjects studied.\nc) lead to increased inefficiencies in the educational institutions, and a further contraction of the higher education sector\nd) serve to limit the contributions that further and higher education can\nmake to society\ne) mean that higher education will become localised.\nICU Instructs:\n1. The officers of ICU to inform all members of ICU as to the facts about\nloans for student as outlined in the above.\n2. The officers of ICU to organise a general letter to MPs outlining the\nabove policy, which all IC students will be able to send to their own MPs.\n3. The students of ICU to publicise the above policy to fellow students,\nparents and anyone else they can think of.\nIC U GM Thursday March3 rd LOOditi Great Hall\n\n"

Hit Squad\nSwing Vote\nA Guilds Hit Squad invaded a General Union Council meeting\non Tuesday night, and after\n'hitting' members of the ULU\nExec, stayed to vote on a controversial motion.\nThe GU C, which is the Council of the University of London\nUnion, had been in session in the\nUL U Building for some time\nwhen the squad of three Guildsmen, attired in white coats,\nhelmets and scarves, entered the\nmeeting. John Passmore, GU C Chairman and an ex-President\nof ICU, remained remarkably\ncalm and requested the members\nof the squad to wait until the end\nof the meeting, but they moved\nthrough the delegates and hit\nUL U President Chris Sale and\nVice-President Jim Bryce with\nplates of shaving foam. Later,\nthey meted out the same treatment to the other VP, Louise\nBarnes.\nThe meeting then went on to\nvote on a motion to dismiss the\nChairman of the International\nAffairs Committee. The motion\nwas passed by four votes out of\nthe sixty-odd present; subsequent recounts showed a major-continued from front page\nshould be a Grade II administrator paid \u00a316,000pa.

He would\nalso control the Wardens who\nwould no longer be responsible\nfor administration and would\nthus no longer be paid.\nJohn Lauwerys\nReactions to the report have\nso far ranged from the skeptical\nto the \\t\\r \"MIQUS. Nick Pyne, a Uii ' it ive on the\nSiudem ^aiden ce Committee\nwhich will be considering the\nreport at its next meeting on\nMarch 23, claimed that full\nimplementation of the report\nwould result in a100% increase\nin rents within two years.\nit y of three, then one. A Poll\nVote was called, and as only six\nof the Imperial delegation of\neight were present, two members\nof the hit squad were made\ntemporary delegates. The motion was then passed on the Poll\nby three votes.\nGuilds Union officers declined\nto reveal who had hired the Hit\nSquad, but the general feeling\namong the delegates was that\nJohn Passmore had remained\nsuspiciously calm throughout\nthe meeting. Mr Passmore\nrefused to make any intel lig ble comment on the subject.\nSimon Rodan, the ICU External Affairs Officer described\nthe meeting as 'boring'.\nWater!\nCold water is now intermittently\navailable in Soutfiside Halls\nonce more as Estates are filling\nup the tanks from Linstead\nmains supply.

    "content": "IG LUB S& SOCIETIES I C&G Thank you to all those of you that turned out\nto collect for Rag during the week. Special\nthanks are due to the little group of four who\nbraved the early hours of Saturday morning in\norder to keep up the tradition of Guilds 24hr Rag Collection. Mike Stuart was the only one\nto survive the full 24hrs with a magnificent\ncollection total of over \u00a3200.\nThe Bed Race on Saturday morning was\nvery successful. The 'bed' and 'wheelbarrow'\nteams collected just under \u00a397. The 'Waitrose\nTrolley' team got lost somewhere between\nHarrods and Sloane Square and we haven't seen a sign of them yet.\nAltogether the 24hr colle c it on raised \u00a3460.\nThe raft race last Sunday resulted in the\nusual confusion and cries of 'we won, we won'.\nWe are therefore appealing for a stewards\nenquiry. The blue arm of the law stretched a little further than normal this year, and our\nintrepid Guilds raft team was delayed. But\ndespite this, they finished well up with the\nother teams.\nWell now that Rag Week is nearly over, it is\ntime to turn towards more serious things. The\nelections for the new Guilds exec take place at\nour U GM on Tuesday March 15. If you have\nbeen considering standing for one of the eight\nexec posts then look out for the papers which\ngo up today. This is your big chance to redirect\nthe union in the direction th ab you see fit. Do\nyou have ideas on what fresher s should want\nfrom the union in 1983/4? Then why not direct\nit yourself.\nBefore that on Sunday March 6 we have\nsoccer sixes out at Harlington. If you can get a team of six together then get their names and\nhand them in to the Guilds Union Office as\nsoon as possible, the sooner the better.\nHave a good week.\nRolf\nSoc Soc\nThe Socialist Society of Imperial College is\norganising a demonstration against the\nUniversity of London's involvement's with\nSouth Africa. We are asking many other\ncolleges, universities and polytechnics to join\nus in this picket. Therefore we call on all IC\nstudents to get out last week's FELIX and read\nMike Mallick's article again\u2014'South Africa\u2014\nWho Cares?' and then take some action. We\nhope to show our distaste at our university's links (including academic, economic and in the\nway of careers) to the repressive regime in\nSouth Africa.\nShow how much you care! Will you miss a morning's lectures to demonstrate against our\nindirect support of a government that takes\nmuch more than a morning out of many\nblack's lives? ,;\nJoin all those with a moral conscience! Join\nthe demonstration in Prince Consort Road on\nWednesday March 2. Meet Beit Arch 9:20am Demonstrate 10:00a ml:00 pm. IC CND\nNinety-six Cruise missiles (up to 30 metres\naccurate) are due to be deployed at Greenham\nCommon in Berkshire by the end of this year,\nif not sooner. The British government is\nplanning to spend about \u00a310,000,000 on the\nTrident missile system (at Jeast 500 warheads\nof at least 150 kilo tonnes explosive capacity\neach, ie, at least 5,000 Hiroshimas, compared\nto the Polaris syst ej gj^ oj'.200 warheads totally\n2,600 Hiroshimas). B% fh systems (Cruise and\nTrident) represent a unilateral escalation of\nthe arms race. Public opinion polls show over\n50% of British people opposed to Cruise and\nTrident missiles. C ND will stop them coming\nhere.\nBut not without your support! IC C ND Group has over 300 people on its mailing list\nand a growing membership of more than 30.\nMore of either are always welcome.\nWe are about to become more active, since\nspeaker meetings by themselves have only\nlimited effectiveness. One of the actions we\nshall soon be involved with is the Anti-Trident\nPostcard Campaign. A huge scale has been\nconstructed in the City Chambers, Glasgow,\nin the form of a twelve foot high Trident missile\nand an enormous basket. The basket will hold\nup to one million postcards object ir^ to the\nTrident missile system, and will in time show\nvisibly that the weight of public opinion is\nagainst Trident. The best of the postcards,\nwhich are obtainable from me or the C ND Bookstall in the JCR on Monday lunchtimes,\nprice one penny, is 'Dear Secretary of State for\nDefence, Trident is a weapon that Britain does\nnot need and cannot afford, and it undermines\nmoves towards nuclear disarmament, to which\nour government claims it is committed. I object\nto the decision to proceed with the Trident\nproject and call on you to abandon it forthwith.\nI await your early reply.'\nRobert Keteey\nCiv Eng 3\nFoP\nWe are pleased to announced that we have\nfinally been accepted by the Union as an\nofficial society and as members of the\nOverseas Student Committee. Our general\nmeeting of this term will take place at 12:45 on\nMarch1 in Room201 of the Civ Eng\ndepartment. As we promised elections will\ntake place at this meeting to decide who will\nmake up the society's committee. Any\nmember who would like to get involved with\nthe running of the committee should get him or\nherself nominated for a posit on on the\ncommittee. Nominations with proposer s and\nsenders should be sent either to B Al-Tabbara\nor B Dials of Civ Eng via letter-racks prior to\nthe meeting.
