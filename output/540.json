    "content": "REVIEWS11 ALL THAT IS\nGLITTERS NOT BLONDIE? Debbie Harry is voluptuous, was the\nverdict at the first of seven concerts by\nrock group, Blondie at the Hammersmith Odeon on Friday.\nIt was one of those concerts where you\nstood up and danced \u2014 clapped or just\nadmired the lady in action. She was in\nsuperb form, sending the blood temperature up in many a young man even before\nthe second number (Slow Motion) had\nended, during which she almost managed\nto screw herself into the floor.\nDrummer, C lem Burke \u2014 the second\nKeith Moon \u2014 was also a 'super hero'\nshowing vast amounts of energy. Beating\nan .excellent solo introduction to Union\nCity Blues. Speaking about good beatings, a girl (Friday) and boy (Sunday)\nmanaged to get on the stage. They were\nquickly removed, by a large security guard.\nClassic Blondie tracks played included\nDenise, Picture This, Heart Of Glass,\nand Hanging On The Telephone. The\nencores (2) included Sunday Girl with\nRobert Fripp as a guest. The whole performance lacked nothing either musically or on the lighting side.\nThe touts had a field day charging \u00a330\nfor a stall ticket, though thanks to Tim Reeves I was able to get a ticket for\nSunday's performance a lot cheaper.\nIf you ever get the chance to see\nBlondie, DO. Your on-the-scene reporter\nMickie Marsh PS: Has anyone a ticket spare for future\ndates (20th \u201422nd January) please!\nLONDON CALLING\nThe Clash\nWell, the third Clash album is upon us\nand is their most diverse collection of\nmaterial yet. This album is far removed\nfrom the glue stained punk of The Clash\nand soft he ay metal of Give 'Em Enough\nRope. Well enough with the history lesson, on with the music.\nTaking the tracks in order, we start\nwith London Calling which is a call to\nunity that creates a feeling that this could\nbe the last decade if things go on as they\nare now (ie needless division of punks \u2014\nmods\u2014dreads\u2014skins\u2014angels\u2014hippies\u2014\ndisco kids etc and hatred). Brand New\nCadillac is slightly Xerox rockabilly that is\nsaved by a great line that serves as a poke in the eye for those who think men\nare men and women should do what\nthey're told: \"Balls to you Big Daddy (She\nain't never coming back\". On to Jimmy\nJazz \u2014 this really is great: the dirtiest,\ngreasiest blues tune I 've heard in ages.\nStrummer sings this like he's half cut\nwhich adds to the atmosphere. Hateful,\nthe second good track in a row, is a piece\nof amphetamine d boogie about the drug\ntaking that goes on in certain circles \u2014 ie\ndon't do it. Rudie Can't Fail, another\ngood track, potentially great, about the\naggro facing Rudie (or any other rebel for\nthat matter), how people try and shape\nyou and how they put you down if you\ndon't conform. Spanish bombs starts side\ntwo and it's fairly harmless, musically\nlimp but the sentiments expressed in the\nsong are good: revolution in 1980? 81?\n82? The Right Profile \u2014 this is a killer -a tribute to Montgomery Clift (whoever\nhe is), but bowls along like a chieftan\ntank, threatens to go out of control \u2014\nlove it! Lost In The Supermarket about\nbeing overwhelmed by consumerism, but\nit's very innocuous and bland. Sadly, it's rather disposable. Next, Working For The\nClampdown: this is classic Clash, deals\nwith the propaganda with which we are\nbombarded today about \"growing up and\ncalming down\". Last one on album one is\nGuns Of Brixton, written by Paul Simon on( bassist), it's terse reggae with\noppression as its theme; another good\ntrack.\nAlbum two kicks off with Wrong 'Em\nBoyo: Strummer stops this half way through and restarts the song ska style\nwhich works well and should be great\nlive. Now on to Death Or Glory,\nhmmm....slightly heavy metal, lads, a bit\nof a disappointment really, but no one's perfect \u2014 it's about how punk sold out\n(Ha!) which we all know about and don't want to be reminded of. Koka-Kola next,\nI bet CBS USA had a shock when they\nheard this, as it's about their( USA Executive) favourite pastime, namely shoving vast amounts of cocaine up their\nnoses \u2014 the song does not glorify it.\nThen the token Phil Spector track which\nreally is a wall of sound, namely The\nCard Cheat about the futility of gambling,\nbut what can a poor boy do? Then Lovers Rock which is awful, about sexism\nand equality \u2014 the sentiments expressed\nare good but are put across so mawkishly\nit makes me cringe. Four Horsemen, the\nnext track is just as bad; stop, 1 say. I'm Not Down: again too Beatley for my\nliking, but a good song about not succumbing to defeat. Revolution Rock,\ngood song, excellent reggae \u2014 the title\nsays it all. Last track, not listed on the\nsleeve Train In Vain, a sould song in the\nbest mod style no less, but whipped out\nby the band in a way that makes Secret\nAffair look what they are \u2014 useless.\nAll in all a good a blum, with a few bad\npoints and songs, but it makes me feel it's probably the last good Clash album as I can see them becoming more introverted\nand embarrassing (ie Lovers Rock). I hope not though.\nSimon Jerome\nDEBBIE PLAYS POP WITH IGGY\n10\n\n"

Dear Colin\nI must comment about the\ngeneral standard of last week's FELIX.\nMost articles were short and\nto the point. The NUS Conference Report by Chirs Webb\nwas a fine piece of journalism\nand Roger Stotesbury's Hon\nSec Report yielded several bits\nof useful info. Perhaps some of\nlast term's contributors missed\nthe boat for this first edition of\n1980, and others had made\nNew Year's Resolutions!\nSadly, our friendly, neighbourhood Liberal correspondent\nlet the side down by neither\nmissing the copy date nor\nchanging his tune. Discussing\n'New Technology', 'The Cuts'\nand Liberal politics is important\nif there is anything new to be\nsaid, but 1 get a distinct feeling\nof deja vu from last term's FELICE S,U GM s, Liberal literature, etc. Could it be that\nMr Cole is using che pages of\nFELIX for a repeated filtration\nof his prototype article-letter-speech; and if so, are we\nsteadily getting a purer product\nin the most concentrated form,\nor just bigger and bigger lumps\nof the mucky residue?\nLast week's editorial took a fresh look at entertainments at\nIC. In my view this is an\nimportant issue, and if most\nstudents have not been showing much concern about the\nsituation of late, it is only\nanother indication that current\nEnts programmes are not\nfulfilling their potential as a central part of College life. The\nforthcoming FELIX question-aire should give a good guide\nof grass-roots opinion to the\npowers that be in the Union.\nThe Editor's decision to drop\nout of PWP is also encouraging\nbecause it provides an opportunity for a new face to be\nelected onto the Union Council. I feel that this democratic\nexercise will have been pointless if an established hack is\nelected to his second or third\npost, as it would not be a step\nin the direction of ensuring the\nwidest possible representation\nof views in the making of\ndecisions which affect us all.\nYours\nJG Murphv Mech Eng 1\nDear Colin\nI see from your last editorial\nthat you have considered the\ncreation of a new Union post\n(Social Secretary). The most\nsurprising thing to me is the\ncomparatively lowly status of\nIC Ents with the Union. How\ncan Ents be compared with\nSCAB Clubs such as Debating\nSociety and Folk Club, which\n(at least at present) cater for\nmuch more specialized groups?\nHas anyone considered making IC Ents more important and thus more direct iy \u2022 responsible to the Executive\nand the Union members?\nMick Berry\n2\n\n"

    "content": "RUGBY ST MARY'S COLLEGE vs IC 1st XV:414 As the team travelled down to\nTwickenham, we all had hopes for a good start to the second half of the\nseason.\n* From the kick-off, it was clear that\nthe St Mary's pack were going to be\nquite a handful, but due to some determined and spirited teamwork, our\npack were able to contain them, adequately.\nAlthough under constant pressure,\nthe IC forwards were able to supply\nnovice scrum-half/capt Eddie (me!)\nwith some excellent ball. This was in\nturn put to good use by our stand-in\nstand-off, Tony Morgan. With some\nuseful kicking and positive running by\nthe backs, we were able to put our\nopposition under a lot of pressure.\nFrom a scrum on St Mary's25,I was\nable to break blind and slip an inside\nball for (young man?) Ray Parkinson\nto score. After this St Mary's began to\nplay a little more, but were well\ncontained by a sound IC defence.\nOur second try was a copy book try;\nthe ball was smartly fed along the 3's, with full-back, Nick Morton, making an\nextra man, to Ray, who \"opened his\nlegs\" to score under the posts.\nThe second half was a tougher battle and we were made to produce\nsome of the most determined play,\nseen for a long time, to retain our\nslender lead. The killer punch came\nlate on, when Andy Lo raw z inter-c ep ted a pass and sprinted thirty\nyards to score a well deserved, if\nsomewhat fortunate try.\nAll in all, it was a very worthwhile\nperformance from the whole team and\nmade the game very enjoyable.\nC CU HOCKEY In a thrilling match, the result of\nwhich was however, never in doubt,\nRCS showed their opponents how to\nwin, with a determined performance.\nFor the first twenty minutes, the match\nwas fairly evenly balanced, with RCS first having the edge. The breakthrough came after 22 minutes, when\n'guest' player Chris Riley scored his\nfirst goal. Paul Farrington soon added\na second and Chris Riley made it\nthree just before the interval after one\nof his many penetrating runs.\nThe second half saw RCS slacken\nsomewhat, conceding one goal soon\nafter the break, scoring one themselves almost immediately, but then\nslipping to a narrow 4-3 lead. However the result was put beyond doubt\nby surprise choice left-winger Keith\nSchrod. A sixth goal was added by\nRobyn' sorry I 've lost the shirts' Morgan.\nRCS captain Rick Archer said afterwards: \"I am pleased to see that\nthe intensive training that my players\nwent through over the Christmas hold i ay has paid off. I bet that the\nMiners are as sick as parrots.\"\nThe Mines team were later said to\nbe \" as sick as parrots'.\nLADIES' HOCKEY\nIC LADIES vs KINGS COLLEGE HO SP:43 Last Saturday IC Ladies attempted to\ngo out to Harlington by mini-bus.\nThanks must go to Pat Dunleavy for\ngetting out of bed to try to start the mini-bus. However, all his efforts failed and\nwe resorted to London Transport and\neventually arrived half an hour late.\nThe pitch was very hard and\nconditions throughout the game were\nnot ideal. Both teams had to concentrate\non accurate short passes.\nIt was Imperial who adopted their\ngame most successfully and took the\nlead early on when a shot from Fay Hood\ntook a deflection off a Kings' stick and\nlanded in the back of the net.\nImperial continued to dominate the\nplay but Kings looked dangerous on the\nbreak and it was thanks to some solid\ntackling from Cathy Crossley that they\nwere unable to score in the first half. At\nhalf-time the home team were 2-0 up\nwith Fay Hood adding to her earlier goal\nwhen she picked up a superbly timed\npass from Hilary Carter.\nEarly in the second-half Kings came\nback to 2-1, but Imperial continued to\napply pressure. We were awarded ape nel ty flick when the Kings' goal y deliberately obstructed on the goal line.\nShirley Course made the flick count.\nKings began to make more penetrating\nmoves especially up the right-wing but\nfound the IC defence too solid. And again pulled back to a one goal margin.\nThe fourth Imperial goal was scored\nby Carol Thomas, but Imperial began to\nflag in the dosing minutes of the game\nand Kings scored the final goal, again\nfrom a break by the right-wing.\nThe team was: Averil Horton, Alex\nBurnip, Cathy Crossley, Clare Davy,\nShirley Course, Julia Towns (Capt),\nAlison OVersby, Hilary Carter, Fay\nHood; Mary Harrington and Carol\nThomas.\nHay Food\nFOOTBALL\nOn Saturday, the seconds returned\nto Harlington's pastures green and\nbecame the first side to take a point\nfrom UC this season. Playing with\nnumerous seasonal handicaps of\nhaircuts, new boots and surfeits of\nturkey. The side fought hard to record\na fine moral victory and maintain this\nseason's unbeaten record against other UL College and Hospital opp osi tion.\nUniversity College kicked off and\nimmediately resorted to their iniquitous tactics. They played the ball to\ntheir midfield men, deliberately forcing\nPhil Niccols to tackle and thus muddy\nhis new boots. If this wasn't enough to\nboil the blood of any honourable sportsman, the UC winger then blatantly centred the ball, compelling\nDec McG uck in to head clear, and ruffle his beautifully groomed coif ure. For a while IC withstood this in timid a tory assault, but the defence was\nfinally pierced by a loopy header.\nRewarded by their initial bouts of\nprovocation, UC proceeded with this\nstyle of play, but added a second\ndimension, speed, to their repertoire.\nThe true sportsman of IC defence,\nHOCKEY IC 3 rds managed to do what Leicester City had failed to do: beat\nHarlow on their own ground. However,\nafter having realised that they were\nnot playing the Harlow team, IC 3rds produced some exciting pressure play\nin the first ten minutes. The Harlow\ndefence was severely stretched, partly\ndue to them playing a 'kicking back'\nrather than a goalkeeper and partly\ndue to the speed of the IC attacks.\nThe Harlow defence had to give eventually and it was centre forward\nMark Talbot who put his name on the\nscore sheet first. That the Harlow defence was lacking in both confidence and coordination was shown\nwhen left-winger Robyn Morgan was\nleft completely unmarked to score the\nsecond goal from a right-wing cross.\nTheir vu ner ability to the crossed ball\nwas emphasised once more wK,..a cross from the left-wing found the\nright winger Daniel Benham in a similar situation. This made the interval score 3-0 to IC.\nIn the second half however, the\npicture was very different. The IC\ndefence was put to the test and found\nto be lacking in match practice as a unit and it was only due to several\nincredible scores and a few stupendous (!) saves from goalkeeper David\nMoynham that IC were able to keep a clean sheet. Up front, the forwards\nhad less success due to the fact that\nHarlow were playing a highly effective\nbut hyper-negative offside game (is\nthis why they had no supporters?)\nwhich suggested that a goal would\nonly come from a break. Daniel Benham, with the speed of a lame\ncart horse on its way to the knacker s' yard, ran forty yards to score his\nsecond and IC's fourth goal, five\nminutes from time. IC had a goal\ndisallowed for offside, but the final\nscore, in a highly competitive match\nwas four goals to nil.\nwho had enjoyed a gluttonous festive\nseason, realised the opposition were\nplaying their trump card, and responded with their own special branch\nof football. UC scored from the\nresulting penalty-kick.\nA half-time pep-talk on the true\nethics of the game put fire in the\nbellies of the team. From then onwards the game became virtually\none-way traffic towards the UC goal.\nIC had so much possession they should have been referred to the\nMonopolies Commission! A Jim Beer\noverlap forced a corner. As the ball\ncame over the UC centre-half could\nonly bury his elbow in Niccols' gut to\nprevent a certain goal. Niccol s converted the penalty. Another run put\nTom Hanke through to score, ony to\nbe ruled offside. Minutes later, Hanke\ngrabbed the equalise r with a glorious\nswirling shot. UC' s final token attack\nwas smothered with ease, and only the\nfull-time whistle prevented further IC\ngoals.\nThe team was: S Veats, J Beer, D> Cooke, D McGuckin, B Scannell, G Brereton, K Buckley, P Niccol s, A Philipps, T Hanke, and D McPhail.\nGiles Brereton\n\u2022 11\n\n"

    "content": "PLAYING GAMES WITH THE OLYMPICS Cricket never really caught on in Russia; there is a marked dearth of\nbaseball teams as well. Right now the real\nsports interest in Russia lies in the Olympic Games, that monument to amateur sports and an all too easy prey\nto international politics. The Games have\ncome to mirror the tensions of contemporary world affairs, at the expense of\nparticipants who are losing their individuality and are known better by their\ncountry of origin than by their names. In\nearlier years, the problem had been the\nshift in emphasis from recreation to\nentertainment; now there is a constant\nbattle to divorce the Olympics from prestige-hunting countries.\nDirection of the modern Olympic movement and the regulation of the\nGames is vested in the IOC( International\nOlympic Committee), with strict rules\nrelating to the amateur status of its\nparticipants. The honour of holding the\nOlympics Games is awarded to a city,\nand not to a country, the choice of the\ncity lying entirely with the IOC. They\nhave never been held in Russia before; in\ntheory, the choice of city made by the\nIOC is unbiased, but if the city chosen\nlies in a country politically structured like\nRussia, it is an unfortunate fact that the\nresponsibility will be as sim ilia ted by the\ncentral government to the abeyance of\nthe underlying ideals.\nThere is no doubt that Russia puts\nconsiderable political value on the Games. Since their revival in1896 from the classical Greek notion of an amateur\nsports competition, this trend has been\ngrowing, with ugly manifestations in the\n1936 Games in Berlin, and the carnage\nwrought by Palestinian terrorists at\nWHAT' SON FRIDAY 18th JANUARY\nIC CHRISTA IN UNION: The Meaning of\nthe Kingdom for Early Christains \u2014 Kim Tan at 6:30pm in the Music Room,53 Prince's Gate.\nFILM: ROLLERBALL at 8:00pm in the\nHuge s Parry Hall, Cartwright G dns.

Now the most ambitious\ninterference to date is being planned, by\nwestern powers, to disrupt the games to\nthe detriment of Russia in retaliation for\nher military intervention in Afghanistan.\nThe United Nations has made it abundantly clear that they hold the presence\nof Soviet troops in Afghanistan to be\nundesirable, but any practical redress lies\nin the hands of the discreet nations.\nPresident Carter's demand that the\nOlympics be removed from Moscow has\nbeen rebuffed by the IOC who state\ncategorically that they cannot change the\nvenue. America is backed by Britain and Canada has offered to play host to the\nGames; the Netherlands has gone so far\nas to withhold financial aid from its\nathletes. But the crucial point is the western powers( and theoretically everyone else) are obliged to make only\nrecommendations; decisions should lie at\nthe discretion of the national Olympic committees. In an effort to resolve these\nproblems, the Greek government suggested that the Games be lifted out of the\npolitical arena and held permanently in\nGreece. To allow Russia to hold the\nOlympics in Moscow would mean overlooking her military intervention; although the IOC may not revoke their\nstatement, western powers maybe successful in playing for withdrawals from\nthe Games to force Russia to give them\nup.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nHaving the attention focused on Moscow may prove surprisingly beneficial\nto British sports, with regard to the\nrecent approval by the English Rugby\nTUESDAY 22 JANUARY\nSTOIC TRANSMISSION1:00 pm.

For this, it was expected\nthat the Black African nations would try\nfor the exclusion of British from the Commonwealth Games in 1982 and at\nleast seriously hinder her participation in\nthe Olympics in Moscow. The decision\nhad serious implications for British sport\nas a whole, threatening to isolate her in\nworld sport. While she is unlikely to be\nforgiven quickly, Britain should have little\nmore time and privacy to investigate whether sport in South Africa is\norganised on a multiracial basis or not.\nFor America, stepping out in front,\nCarter's call for collective action is still far\nfrom answered. Europe has failed to agree on sanctions against Russia, either\nOlympic or economic. America taking the\nlead over the Games may well be a way\nfor her to sound out the opinions and intentions of her allies on the economic\nfront, Carter hoping to build on the sports issue to prevail upon the west to\nalso hit back with embargoes. His anxiety\nthat America might be left out on a limb\nis compounded by the fact that Britain's \u00a3950 million export credit to Russia is due\nfor renewal in the next few weeks; if it is\nnot cancelled, collective action could become the object of ridicule. Carter's most controversial decision was to place\nsuch importance on the Olympics, which\nby definition are not subject to any international restraints and so cannot be\ncontrolled by external powers. International exchanges of any kind are liable\nto debasement by politics; the IOC now\nhas the difficult task of safeguarding the\nOlympic Games and with it world sport.\nLars Wernberg-Meller\nWHAT IS SATISFACTION? an informal\nmeeting by the Christain Sciene Organisation at 1:00pm in 2 nd Year Seminar\nRoom, Botany Dept.\nAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL present\na lecture by Mr George The in er on Czechoslovakia at 1:30pm in Che mEng Lecture Theatre 1.\nGAY SOC GENERAL MEETING at\n1:00pm in the Green Committee Room, Union Building.\nASSOCIATED STUDIES PRESENTS:1.

So below you'll see answers to the\nquestions we are most often asked.\nQ: What qualifications do I need?\nA: A degree in Electrical or Electronic Engineering,\nElectronics, Applied Physics or any other relevant science\nsubject. We also welcome people with H NC/H ND, C&G Full Tech. or TEC Higher Certificates in Electronics\nor Telecommunications.\nQ: The BBC is a very large organisation-where would\nI fit in?\nA: Our Engineers work in a wide variety of disciplines\nincluding digital techniques, micro-circuitry, automation,\ndata processing and transmission, high-quality\nquadraphonic, stereo and mono sound reproduction.\nAs you can see, the scope for development-both yours and\nours-is limitless.\nQ: So presumably you'll be able to give me full training?\nA: Our engineering instruction is the best in the world,\neither in or out of the broadcasting business. Any Engineer\nwith BBC training can count him or herself firmly among\nthe engineering elite. Prospects within the BBC are, as you\nmight expect, outstanding-today's recruits are tomorrow's experts.\nQ: If I joined the BBC where would I be based?\nA: You could be located anywhere in the UK, in posts\nranging from Research to Operational Engineering-the long\narm of the BBC extends a lot further than Broadcasting\nHouse.\nQ:What about pay and benefits?\nA: The simple answer is, the right people get the right money.\nSalaries in 1979 for Engineers started at around \u00a35,170 in\nLondon or \u00a34,720 elsewhere and most recruits earned a great deal more by way of shift allowance and overtime.\nGraduate trainees received at least \u00a35,745. These salaries\nwill be reviewed in April 1980.\nQ: How do I apply?\nA: Check with your Careers Adviser to see whether we are\nvisiting your University or College. If we are not, then write\ndirect to Bob Neal, Engineering Recruitment, BBC, Broadcasting House, London W1A 1A A. U3U3U3\nCHAPLAINCY GROUPS MONDAY\nMaths and CCD:12:30 pm:( Huxley) 6M42.

Return late afternoon\n(in time for the Rag JCR Toga Party)\nSPORT IN BRIEF SATURDAY The Imperial College Rugby 1sts walked\naway from Hartington with a good win at the\nexpense of HAC RFC. A try by John chandler, converted by Eddie Budgen together\nwith a penalty from Pat Dunleavy took the\nscore fine to 9\u20143 by full time.\nThe 2nds did even better beating Queen\nElizabeth College 11 points to 3. Fran O 'Toole\nopened the scoring in the first half with an\nun converted try. Nick Morion added a second\nwith a penalty in the second half.\nThe soccer news was not so good: the 1sts went down 5\u20140 to Kings College Hospital,\nwhile the 6th s lasts 7\u20142 to the same college.\nThe 2nds did slightly better drawing 2\u20142\nagainst University College 2nds, with Phil\nNiccols and Tom Hanke scoring the goals. The\nIC 3rds lost 3\u20142 to University College, Andy\nHartland scoring both the -goals here. On a happier note, the 5th s beat UC4 th s by default\nafter they failed to show.\nFinally, hockey and IC's1 sts won 2\u20140,\nbeating Harlow with goals from Tony Debarr\nand Graham Forbes on Saturday. The 3rds won as well beating Harlow twice as\neffectively. Goats from Daniel Benham, Robin\nMorgan and two from Mark Talbot took the\nscore-line to 4\u20140.\nWEDNESDAY The first rug ger team continued with\nSaturday's form beating Kings College at\nHariington on Wednesday. A first half try by\nJohn Chandler, converted by Eddie Budgen\nwas all that was needed leaving the final score\n6\u20143.\nThe only other rugby on Wednesday since\nthe seconds match was cancelled was the\nRS M matches against Surrey.'The 1sts did\nwell beating Surrey Ists 12\u20140. After no score\nat half time, due in part to the fact that they\nwere playing uphill. Vision Tucker and Bat\nWalmsey both scored trys and both were\nconverted by Maynard McMaynard.\nThe RS M2 nds also walked away from\nSurrey with a win beating Surrey 2nds7 \u20146,\nthanks to a try from Russ Clark and a penalty\nfrom Jeremy Taylor. The RS M3r ds didn't do\n'quite as well los i ong14 \u20140 to Surrey 3rds. On to soccer again now and the news that\nmust dominate must be the 4th s win over\nGoldsmith's3 rds. They won 7\u20141 despite a score line of 1\u20141 just 25 minutes from the end,\nthis due to a goal from Steve Simms. Two\ngoals from Paul Garvin and Richard Dolan\nwithin a minute p lua four from Tom Hanke\nbuie d Goldsmiths. The score line is all the more\nremarkable because their goalkeeper was\ntransferred to the 3rds for the afternoon and\nthe captain, Dave Brennan had to take his\nplace.\nThe 2nds also had a good win at the\nexpense of the London School of Economics.\nTwo goals from Dick Veenman and anther two\nfrom Dave McPhail took the score to 4\u20140 by\nhalf time. LSE fought well during the second\nhalf but still had to be content with a score line of 4\u20141.\nThe 3rds lost 3\u20142 to Goldsmiths 2nds away. Goals from Ian Stevenson in the first\nhalf and from Andy Hartland in the 2nd made\nthe score look respectable.\nThere was also good news from the 5th s who beat LSE3 rds2 \u20140. A goal from John\nHealy in the first half and another from Nick\nMatthews in the 2nd completed a fairly good\nday for IC soccer.\nThe good news continues with the crosscountry results. E Cameron came in first in\nWednesday's friendly at Petersham with a time\nof 27 minutes~49 seconds, 9 seconds ahead of\nD Feteenstein from U C.M Pickard and S Kirk\nboth from IC came in 3rd and 4th respectively\nunder a minute later.\nCOMING EVENTS The three Imperial College'rug ger teams are\nup against the University Vandals. The 1sts and 3rds are away but the 2nds are playing at\nhome at Hartington.\nThe 1sts soccer team is playing the Royal\nFree Hospital at Hariington, while the 2nds are J up against Kings College. And while the 3rds and 4th s are relaxing with a free weekend the\n5th s and 6th s are at home to Charing Cross\nHospital.\nThe hockey teams are playing Ashford.

This\nsite is in a more central position than the old\noffice in the Union Building, making it more\naccessible to non-student members of IC and\nthe extra space available means that better\nfacilities can be provided.\nISRAELI WEEK The Jewish Society has decided to hold\nan exhibition to further the information\navailable to College students on the\nsubject of Israel. Being in England the\nonly information one receives on Israel is\nwhat one hears through the media, and\nthis is so politically orientated that no one\nhears the other facets of Israeli life and\nculture. For example, did you know....\n....that the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra\nranks among the best in the world.\n....that Israel is no bigger than Wales.\n....that inflation in Israel is over 100%\n....that Israeli girls do....army service!\n....that ISRAEL is!!\nDuring the four-day activity, we will be\ntwo films, hearing the chairman of the\nZionist Federation talk on kibbutz life,\njoining in Israeli dancing and eating Israeli\nfood!\nWe hope to see many of you at these\nevents.\nEXPLORATION SOCIETY: PROPOSED EXPEDITION TO THE THIRD WORLD A group of us within the ExDloration Society is\nconcerned about environmental problems in the Third\nWorld. We are interested in forming an expedition to\na Third World country to see what kind of problems\nexist and how important they are.\nIf you are interested please come to next Monday's meeting (21st January) of the Exploration Society al\n12:30pm in the Upper Lounge above Stan's Bar,\nSouthside.\nAlternatively contact Ken Kitson, Room 310, Mech\nEng Dept, internal l3566.

FELIX is printed on the Union premises in Prince\nConsort Road, London SW7. Editor: CR Palmer\nFELIX ISSN 0140-0711. Registered at the Post Office. Copyright FELIX\n1980. FELIX, the Editor of FELIX and Union Officers cannot accept\nliability in respect of errors or omissions contained in articles herein.\nLast Tuesday, forty students turned up to a meeting discussing\nthe 'Role of I CW A'. Male and female students heard that a motion\nwhich will effectively abolish I CW A is to be put to aUG M in the\nnear future.\nInstead of just discussing the role of IC WA,a lot of time was\nspent on the topic of why I CW A should exist at all. Some suggested that it should become a social club, while others argued\nthat I CW A didn't need a special room. Students who were in favour of the abolition of I CW A asked,\" What can it do that isn't covered by other college groups\". The I CW A committee defended their association and a decision was\nmade to send out a questionnaire to all women students at\nImperial. The exact question to be put will be decided at a meeting\nthis Friday Lunchtime.\nNEW STUDENT PAPER\nOn Wednesday a new newspaper was distributed at Imperial.\nLondon Student, which was formerly called Sennet, is edited by\nJackie Lewin. FELIX interviewed Jackie and she explained why SEN NET had been renamed. The paper has to rely on finance\nfrom advertisers. SEN NET had developed a bad name with\nadvertising agencies because of its unreliability. Jackie hoped that\nLondon Student would be issued every week and that the name would be more meaningful to advertisers.\nLADIES RUGBY\nYesterday, the Evening News came to the Ladies Rugby\npractice and their article is likely to be printed next week.\nThe SUN is to feature the Ladies and any money that is earn t from the papers will be put towards a Ladies Rugby Shirts Fund. It\ncosts \u00a3100 to kit out the team with shirts.\nNext Sunday Nationwide will be filming a match between the\nLadies of Imperial versus a team from University College.\nThe kick-off is at 11 am, at Harlington. Come to the Union Lower Lounge at 9.00 am if you would like to support your team.\nOnce again FELIX has had to cope with production difficulties.\nHowever, the immediate problems have been solved. The newspaper has been drastically reduced in size and some articles\nhave had to be left out.\nIt is Election time - STOIC would like to hear from Sabbatical\nelection candidates in order to help them with their Election promotions.\n\n"

    "content": "ROBERT PRYOR MEMORIAL LECTURE Last Monday, the 13th of January, M rAG Frame, the Deputy Chairman of\nR TZ gave the Robert Pryor Memorial Lecture to the Mining and Metallurgical\nSociety. Sir Mark Turner had originally\nbeen invited to give the lecture, but was\nunable to do so because of an overseas\nengagement.\nThe lecture's purpose was to acknowledge the late Prof Pryor' s work and interests. He worked for many years at\nRio Tinto, both in general management\nand in training many young people in his\ndiscipline. The skill with which these men\nare now applying themselves in the\ndevelopment of this important ore body is,\nsaid Mr Frame, a fitting tribute to the\nman.\nThe main themes of the lecture were\nBritain' s role in the world mineral industries, a British mineral supply policy,\nand the problems facing the world in\nensuring an adequate supply of energy in\nthe next century.\nUK mining houses are an important,\nalthough not dominating force on the\nworld mining scene. However, says Mr Frame, we must all recognise that we live\nin an increasingly nationalistic world, and\nstate intervention is an aspect of our\nmining lives which will not go away, now\nwill the increasing tendency \"for other\ncount i res to have greater local participation in natural resource projects.\nA mineral policy for the UK and Western Europe was then considered.\nThe prime aim of European policy should\nbe to obtain adequate supplies of minerals\nand metals at internationally competitive\nprices, preferably from secure and well\ndiversified sources.\nVery often the best policy is to resist\nthe temptation to interfere in the workings of the market. The Common Agricultural Policy is the biggest warning\nto Brussels about the dangers of\nbureaucratic intervention. Several small\nsteps can be taken both at national and\ncommunity level to improve Europe' s security of mineral supply.\nEnergy is a vitally important subject\nwhich is likely to affect world growth\nand therefore, the outlook of the mining industry. The general consensus of opinion in\nthe petroleum industry is that the world could have all the energy it\nneeds for the rest of the Twentieth Century. There will, however, be problems of distribution and there will probably be substantial increases in prices.\nThe overall conclusion was that unless countries vigorously pursue the\ndevelopment of coal and nuclear power,\nthe outlook for the Twenty First Century is bleak in the extreme.\nHANG-GLIDING CLUB\nVacancies exist on a weekend begin nets' course on\nthe 2nd and 3rd February and for 3rd and 4th day\ncourse on the 16th and 17th of February. For further\ninformation con at ct Chris Golding (Training Officer)\nat Tizard 617 or via the Mech Eng letter-rack, as\nsoon as possible.\nThere is also a meeting on Thursday 24th January\nin Mech Eng 342 at 12:45pm. ORIENTEERING\nICO C had their first outing of 1980 last\nSunday to a club event at Puttenham\nCommon near Guildford. The area\nconsisted of rough open and semi-open\nheath with smaller areas of run n able woodland. This combined with a well\ndefined path system posed few navigational problems for those who competed.\nOn the 'A' course (9.7km), Steve Kirk\n(65 mins) and Alan Parker (72 mins) did\nquite well with Andrew Britton (89 mins)\nnot too far behind. John Weaver (69\nmins) was about ten minutes behind the\nwinner on the 'B' course (8.1km) whilst\non the same course Nick W~*mo ugh clocked a rather dubious 84 ruins. On the\nshorter courses others met with mixed\nsuccess.\nTrips to events are planned for most\nSundays this term which will provide\nplenty of practice for six days of\nchampionships standard orient erring in\nScotland over the easter vacation. As\never meetings take place every Friday at\n12:30pm in the Union Senior Common\nRoom.\nNJ Watmough\nA;RCS Despite the non-appearance of an article\nin last week's FELIX, RCS is alive and\nkicking. Dates have now been sorted out for\nmost of the major events this term.\nAfter a very successful autumn term the\nRCS Rag machine gets back on the road\nagain or rather Oxford Street. The lampposts are looking somewhat the worse\nfor wear and need cleaning. Volunteers to\nhelp rec if y this should meet at 9:30am tomorrow in the RCS Office complete with\nsoap and Rag cans.\nGeneral Committee will meet for the first\ntime this term on Tuesday in the Union Lower Refectory at 6:00pm. Next meeting\nafter this will be on 26th February and\nobservers will be welcome at both meetings.\nOn the sporting side, the RCS soccer\nsixes will take place on Sunday 27th January\nand the RCS rugby sevens on Sunday 10th February. Soccer teams should be given to\nMo Misra and rugby teams to Ray Myers. Mo has also organised training for\nprospective Ten Torists. For those\ninterested this takes place on Monday mornings at 7:30am( meet Beit archway)\nand on Friday evenings at 6:00pm( meet\nUnion Gym). Ents Committee met for the first time this\nterm on Monday. They decided that to\norganise a night out on Tuesday 29th January to the theatre, details of which will\nbe circulated as soon as possible.\nNick Watmough\nMINES There are some important events\ncoming up in the near and not so near\nfuture and since I can't think of\nanything witty to write I 'll just outline them: Wednesday 23rd January: Copy date for Newsletter.\nSunday 27th January: Mines Rugby Sevens. The list is slowly getting bigger, but\nthe more teams there are the bigger and better the competition, so get off\nyour arse s, collect together seven people and enter a team on the list\noutside G20. Friday 15th and Saturday 16th February: CAMBOURNE WEEKEND. The annual clash between Mines and the nonentity down in darkest\nCornwall. The Sports Officer, Pete Newman has the tickets now, so contact him or the Union Office for\nyour s.An ir resist able force is starting to\ndrag me to the indescribable delights of a heat transfer lecture, so\nC& GUA short article this week, just a few\nreminders of what's on. Saturday is Pyjama\nRag, to to make sure we have a good\ncollection we want all of you to turn up at\n9:30am in the Union Office suitably attired.\nRemember to wear something warm under\nthe pyjamas as it is a bit (note subtle\nunder stat ment) cold at this time of year.\nThe next event is the 29th Annual\nEngineers' Dinner and Dance. This is the\nhighlight of the College year and is a formal\noccasion. The event will be held in the\nSherfield Building on Friday 25th January at\n7:30 for 8:00pm.

Reports are flooding in that moles are digging\ntheir tunnels an extra foot deep and\nthat worms are adopting crash helmets in an an attempt to survive\nattacks by pieces of high velocity\nbalsa wood.\nA statement by the club secretary:\nWhile it is true that our membership\nhas increased recently it must be said\nthat efforts have been made to reduce\nthis subterranean\" carnage.\nNick Green broke the club's power\ntrainer in half very neatly and the\ndepth of penetration into the ground\nwas minimal.\nPraise also goes to John Stannard\nwho made use of a convenient black\nhole at Richmond park to fly his\nCorona into a parallel universe where\nit remains to this day.\nIt can be seen that the current trend\nis towards responsible flying although\nthere is always trouble with inexperienced or irresponsible, for example\nthe brutal attack by Trefor Ellis on a worm using Grain's Ipomoea and the\nintroduction by Graeme Dunbar of a fiendish 36\" wing span slope-so are r capable of pinpoint high speed attacks on anything or anybody with\nthe advantage that it remains intact to\nkill again.\nI feel that I should not be too hard\non these cads (my flying being what it\nis) and have given them a chance to\nexplain their behaviour.\nTrefor: / thought it was a snake.\nGraeme: It fits in a carrier bag.\nAs for my excuse: Well, it's good\nfun, inn it? If you have actually read all of this\ndrivel ( IC MAC members may stop now\nand return to their tombs) then chances are that you will wish to know\nmore. Is there more? LOTS! So come\nto one of our meetings in the Southside Upper Lounge on Thursdays at\n1:00pm or contact Jeremy Stuttard,\nElec Eng3.I CCA G Right! A new term! But Imperial College\nCommuntiy Action Group is still and always here\nand we can offer you unlimited opportunity to\nhelp others; and like absolutely nothing else at\nIC, it's totally free.\nThat's one good point, and to cap that are the\nthings we actually do. A fave rave on Tuesdays\nand Fridays are the soup runs to the cowboys (as\nthey call themselves) living in and around the\nEmbankment. These dos s ers prove that the\nstreets of London are not paved with gold but\nrather that it is easier to walk on the sleeping\nbodies of these rather pleasant but a little\nunloved chaps and femme s. They are tons of fun\nand for those of you who smile, we have some\ngood company prepared in these people.\nFalmouth kitchens 10:30pm. For those of you also who hate footy on\nWednesday afternoons we have a few kids who\nneed tutor in q on 'O' level subjects in Pimlico and\nwe can get you in touch with Dr Goodlad who\norganises it. All travelling expenses are refunded\nand you don't even need a passport!\nTwo examples of good things you can do. Now\nmake yourself the third example of good by\nvisiting us any Monday at 12:30pm in the ICCAG\nRoom, third floor of the Union Building.\nStill time to go to the Holly St Adventure\nPlayground. Transport available from Beit Arch at\n10:30am on Saturday.\nA NEW SOCIETY Do you want your grant to go further? Do you\nwant cheaper food? Would like a healthier diet?\nWould you like Mr Mooney to provide better food\nin the canteens? Do you know what goes on in\nfactory farms? Are you against some kinds of\nmeat for religious reasons? Are you vegetarian or\nvegan? Or, do you just want a more varied diet?\nIf your answer to any of these questions is yes,\nthen we have good news for you: there is now a Vegetarian Society. You don't have to be a vegetarian to join \u2014 anyone is welcome. Don't worry, we won't eat you! The next meeting is on\nMonday 28th January at 12:45pm in the Green\nCommittee Room (top floor Union Building, next\nto Welfare). If you have any questions to ask\nabout vegetarianism, you will find plenty of\nanswers there.\nFor more information, contact anyone on the\ncommittee:\nChairman: Dinesh Singh (Maths PG)\nSecretary: Tom Empson (Physics PG)\nTreasurer: Vinod Dhanak (Physics PG)\nPublicity Officer: Fiona Sinclair (Maths\nOrdinary Members: Kirsten Pratt (Maths 2) and\nMark Nathan (EE3).\n2)\nCAMPAIGN FOR REAL FOOD Mr Mooney has promised us that, for the first\ntime since 1950, for one week this term in the\nSherfield Refectory, he will attempt to raise the\nquality of his cooking to more nutritious and\npalatable standards (ie serve better food). If this\nis a success, he may go on to make more\nimprovements, so it is important that everyone\neats this food \u2014 whatever he produces, even if\nyou don't like it \u2014 or he may wait another 30\nyears before he tries again.\nThis is the chance of a lifetime, so make the\nmost of it!\n8\n\n"

A communique stated that this was a limited\naction, instigated in order to protect the\ninterests of the College newspaper, and\nthat our forces will be withdrawn as soon\nas our objectives have been accomplished.\" Propaganda published yesterday implied that there was a likelihood of an\n'an imminent collapse of FELIX.' FELIX immediately retaliated with a tremendous\nshow of force, ten tank divisions and\n20,000 troops being deployed in Princes\nGardens by 11:30. After an initial attempt\nat resistance, Broadsheet newsmen and\nstaff fled into the highland around the\nGardens. There are reports of fierce hand\nto hand fighting on Level 6 of Southside,\nand of rebel forces digging in the Garden basement. During the fighting a limited\nuse was made of tactical nuclear weapons, however students at College\nneed not worry about fallout, as the wind\ncarried 90% away from campus.\nAn explosive situation at the\nheight of the Invasion\nMilitary experts are predicting a FELIX take over of Fleet Street.
