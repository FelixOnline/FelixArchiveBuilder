Most\npeople may think that there is no specific recipe for a Greek Salad. If you consider a Greek\nSalad to be just tomatoes, green leaves and\nfeta cheese, like the one from the JCR and the\nLibrary Caf\u00e9, then you need to take a look at\nthe recipe below that includes all the ingredients you need and some useful do\u2019s and don\u2019ts.\nWhat you need\n1) Medium sized tomatoes\nDO NOT use rotten tomatoes, put them aside\nfor Italian pasta.\n2) Cucumber\nAny kind will be fine. Besides, it adds more\nfreshness than taste.\n3) Red onion\nNo specific clarification is required here. Just\nbe sure to pick the right one for you: not too\nmild, not too strong.\n4) Green pepper\nDO NOT use red, orange, or any other kind\nof pepper.\n5) Feta cheese\nIn the UK, people tend to use creamy feta\ncheese.

Have it\nas a reference to know what you eat and make a\ndifference to your dietary habits!\nL\nLadyfinger = a small finger-shaped sponge cake.\nLapin = rabbit.\nLassi = a yogurt drink popular in India and Pakistan. Yogurt is blended with water or milk and Indian spices.\nLentil = a leguminous plant native to south-west\nAsia, having flat pods containing lens-shaped, edible seeds.\nLoin = the back of an animal when cut into pieces\nfor food.\nM\nMaki = is the Japanese word for \u201croll,\u201d or rolled\nsushi.\nMoussaka = a layered casserole usually made with\neggplant and chopped meat, and toppedwith a custard sauce.\nN\nNaan = means \u201cbread\u201d in Persian, is a flatbread\nsimilar to the original, pocketless pita.\nNougat = a stiff and chewy confection made of\nwhipped egg whites, honey and sugar, to\nwhich nuts (commonly almonds, hazelnuts\nor pistachios), and sometimes candied citrus zest, are added.\nO\nOrzo = tiny melon seed-shaped pasta.\nOuzo = traditional strong Greek drink.\nP\nPaella = a Spanish dish made from\nrice, shellfish, chicken, and vegeta-bles.\nPancetta = found in the fat belly\nor cheek of a pig, consisting of alternating layers of of fat and lean\nissue.\nPappardelle = the classic broad\negg noodle, originally from Tuscany.\nPaprika = a kind of pepper.\nPopover = Yorkshire pudding.\nS\nSashimi = Sliced raw fish, generally served with a\nbowl of plain, steamed rice.\nSaut\u00e9 = saut\u00e9ing is cooking food quickly in the\nright amount of oil or butter over high heat.\nSchnitzel = cutlet.\nSmoothie = A beverage of fruit and yoghurt with\nthe consistency of a milkshake, but much healthier.\nStrong flour = bread flour.\nT\nThyme = A low-growing aromatic plant of the mint\nfamily.\nV\nVermicelli = Pasta in long, very thin strands.\nVermouth = martini.\nMichael Krestas\nModified recipe from the book Vegan Pie in\nthe Sky by Isa Chandra Moskowitz.\nIngredients\nFor the base\n1 and \u00be cups graham crackers or digestives\n3 tablespoons sugar\n4 tablespoons melted non-hydrogenated margarine\n1 tablespoon milk\nFor the cream\n6 ounces silken tofu\nSalt\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\u00bd teaspoon lemon juice\n1 cup soy milk\n\u00bd teaspoon agar powder\n\u00bd cup sugar\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n1 teaspoon lemon extract\nJuice of half a lemon or lime\n1.bp.blogspot.com/\nabandon this recipe.

Greek Salad is synonymous to sim-plicity, so the least time it gets you to cut\nthe tomatoes, cucumber and peppers, peel\nthe onion and spread the feta cheese pieces\nthe best your salad will be. That said I am\nnot implying that you must rush. Just keep\nin mind to choose the right ingredients and\ngood olive oil. Lastly, don\u2019t forget possibly the most crucial thing when it comes\nto enjoying a Greek Salad properly: the socalled \u201cpapara\u201d (probably the easiest Greek\nword to pronounce after \u201cmalaka\u201d), which\nis fresh bread literally soaked in the left\nover mix of oil, vinegar and traces of feta.\nPS: If you\u2019d like to taste real Greek Salad\nbut don\u2019t want to bother making it yourself,\nvisit Greece in the summer.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 15 june 2012 11\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nH\nowever different American healthcare is from\nBritish healthcare, it\nwouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to assume that the\nprinciples of consent are similar. One\nsuch principle is that valid consent\nneeds to be informed; one must be aware\nof the implications of a decision to have\na procedure, the benefits, risks and so\non. When it comes to abortion, it seems\npeople cannot agree on what it means\nto be informed. Some Americans feel\nthat to be sufficiently informed about a\ndecision to terminate one\u2019s pregnancy\na woman must undergo transvaginal\nultrasound. They refer to this together\nwith the provision of other information\nas \u201cthe right to know\u201d.\nWhy would a transvaginal ultrasound\nbe performed in the context of abortion?\nIn Britain, it wouldn\u2019t. Over here, trans-vaginal ultrasound is used to examine\nthe womb, ovaries and other organs\nfor any abnormalities: it is a diagnostic\ntool. Other than letting a woman know\nshe has a baby, which one suspects she\nalready knows, the purpose of the trans-vaginal ultrasound in a healthy pregnancy was initially unfathomable to me.\nThe argument given by campaigners\nfor the \u201cright to know\u201d is \u201cto ensure that\nwomen considering an abortion would\nbe guaranteed access to independent\ninformation and advice from someone\nwho had no vested financial interest in\nthe outcome of their decision.\u201d At first\nglance this appears innocent and even\nBeing informed and the Right to Know\nmoral and maybe it is, but some say\ntheir motive is to discourage abortions.\nAlthough it could have helped illustrate the issues, I will refrain from comparing abortion to any other operation as\nsuch a decision is vastly more complex.\nA better way to look at the compulsory\ninclusion of transvaginal ultrasound\nmay be to disregard the controversies\nsurrounding abortion itself and focus\non what it means to be informed about\na decision. The objective of providing\ninformation to make a decision is neither to condemn nor promote a choice.\nIn fact, it is unethical to impose an option on a person; that person has the\nright to make autonomous decisions\nregardless of how unwise that decision\nappears to others. Absurdly it has been\nsaid that the idea is to put a woman off\nhaving an abortion by forcing her to\nlook at the image of her foetus. Maybe\nthey haven\u2019t checked but even if one\ncould justify why a woman should be\npersuaded not to have an abortion, this\nexperience is highly unlikely to change\nher mind!\nBefore anyone goes as far as to say\nthat denying a woman a transvaginal\nultrasound is depriving her of vital\ninformation that she needs to give informed consent, perhaps they should\nask themselves two questions. Firstly\ndoes it override a person\u2019s autonomy\nto include dissuasion in the process of\ninforming consent? And secondly is it\nacceptable for an invasive procedure\nsuch as transvaginal ultrasound, which\nis of no visible benefit to any party, to\nbe a hoop through which a pregnant\nwoman must jump before she can have\nan abortion?\n... disregard the\ncontroversies\nsurrounding\nabortion itself\nand focus on\nwhat it means to\nbe informed\n\u201c\n... disr\n... disr\ncontrov\ncontrov\n\u201d\nans to\nans to\nd\nd\nAlex Nowbar\nAn ultrasound image of a baby in a womb\nOrgan donation: is it selfless or selfish?\nD\non\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going to intimidate you\nwith statistics in order\nto convince you to give\nyour organs away at\ndeath. Nor am I going to persuade you\nthat you\u2019ll be needing them in the af-terlife. It is after all your body and it\u2019s\nreally none of my business what you do\nwith it.\nBut I wonder if you have ever considered that organ donation might not\nbe that selfless but in fact a little self-ish? At the time of writing (this is 2012\nA.D.), no elixir of life has been invent-ed. At most, we can hope to live into\nour early 100s. Pledging our organs\nat death however gives us functionality beyond the grave, the closest we\ncan get to immortality. One human can\nsave or greatly enhance multiple people\u2019s lives, a rare occurrence in every\nday life, which means you (well, part\nof you) could yet end up as prime min-ister, an Olympian, a Nobel laureate\nor even all three. Look at it this way:\nit\u2019s a reassuring security that on death,\nyour entire being and purpose doesn\u2019t\nevaporate instantaneously. And it\u2019s a\nsecurity that comes both for free and\nwith minimal effort: all of two minutes registering online. So it comes as\na surprise to me that more people don\u2019t\nlisten to their selfish side and embrace\nthis option.\nThe Welsh government are currently\nmoving towards an \u2018opt-out\u2019 system of\norgan donation in which people are automatically placed on the organ donor\nlist unless they object. This method,\nalthough likely to get some apathetic\npeople donating who otherwise might\nnot, is unlikely to change someone\u2019s\nmind that is already set. Tackling how\nand why people make their decision\nwhether to donate or not are, in my\nopinion, far more important. Education\ncould remove the mild taboo surrounding organ donation discussions allowing people to engage with opinions on\nboth sides. This would allow us to make\na more informed decision without feeling forced into donating. If, however,\nthis new legislation clearly removes the\nopportunity for family veto, a chance\nfor family members to go against the\nwishes of the deceased, I am in favour\nof this move; I certainly would not like\nmy selfish security to be taken away\nfrom me by a relative at the last minute.\nNeedless to say, my selfish argument cannot extend to people who give\nblood, stem cells and live kidneys. Yes\nyou might get a bit of a buzz like Nicholas Crace, the oldest living kidney donor at 83, did, who explained that: \u201cIt\u2019s\nnice to feel in old age that one can still\nbe useful\u201d. And you might get a (great-er) chance to be part of a rock group or\nthe cabinet. But achieving these things\ntakes time, effort and discomfort. These\nare surely selfless acts of kindness and\nthose who help other people in this way\nare in my eyes the true heroes.\nStephanie Walton Think about it. If you donate an organ you could become part of a rock star\nor Nobel laureate. Or if you\u2019re Brian May, maybe even both\n... you... could\nyet end up as a\nprime minister,\nan Olympian, a\nNobel laureate\n\u201c\n... you.\n... you\nyet end\nyet end\nn, a\nn, a\neate\nate\n\n"

These range from\n\u2018Safe\u2019 level objects, such as an indestructible\npizza box capable of instantly creating the\nopener\u2019s favourite pizza (SCP-458), to \u2018Keter\u2019\nlevel objects, extremely dangerous paranormal\nhazards such as SCP-035, a sentient porcelain\ndrama mask capable of warping the minds of\nanyone close to it.

Its favourite\nhobby \u2013 and likely only hobby \u2013 is causing\ndeath through neck snapping.\nContainment Breach involves just that: SCP173 escapes its holding cell, and you\u2019re left\nalone to escape the facility. Problem is, SCP173 has other plans.\nGameplay is very simple \u2013 all you have to\ndo is escape. No weapons, just you. Oh, and\na blink meter. That\u2019s right, every 5 seconds or\nso you have to blink, momentarily closing off\nyour vision. As mentioned above, SCP-173 is\nfast, and blinking in its presence leads to a very\nsudden *CRCK* of your neck.

However weird SCP-173 may look,\nnothing can stop you jumping when it suddenly darts up behind you as you turn around to\nclose a door. It\u2019s the suddenness of attacks and\nappearances that sets you constantly on edge,\nthe inclusion of the aforementioned blink meter keeping you from relaxing. Trust me when\nI say there\u2019s nothing in Doom 3 or Dead Space\nthat rivals the tension created as you try to skirt\nround an immobile SCP-173 before your blink\nmeter runs dry and your neck is snapped like a\nshard of dry pasta.\nTrouser wetting is at times completely justifiable and nothing to be ashamed of\nContainment Breach isn\u2019t the first game\nderived from SCP Foundation creations, with\ntwo other games, SCP-087 and SCP-087-B,\nsimply involving you walking down a set of\ndarkened, never-ending stairs.

Still,\nSCP-games provide in pill-concentrate form\nwhat many horror games lack, and ought not\nto be passed up simply on the basis of their\nseemingly basic and low-key nature.\nPay a visit to http://www.scp-wiki.net/ and\nhttp://scpcb.wordpress.com/ for more SCP\nFoundation information and downloads.

For many of us, all of\nthese occasions probably warrant new\nclothes.\nGiven the emphasis placed upon\nsustainable living nowadays, however,\nthere can\u2019t help being some guilt attached to a trip to Westfield when you\nknow you are funding an industry that\npromotes a throw-away philosophy.\nThe realm of fashion is well known for\nits somewhat lax stance on sustainabil-ity, characterised by fleeting trends that\nseem to come and go each month let\nalone each season. In some respects it\nseems that, because of this trait of the\nfashion world, extravagance and wastefulness are inextricably a part of it, but\ndoes it have to be this way?\nIn recent months there have been\nmany signs that the fashion industry\nmay be redeeming itself of its wasteful\nreputation. In March, H&M launched\ntheir Glamour Conscious Collection\nfeaturing clothes made from sustainable materials like hemp and recycled\npolyester. In April, Marks and Spencer\nunveiled their new Schwapping Lab,\nendorsed by Joanna Lumley, where\npeople can give and buy second hand\nclothes. Even better, this month, in\nfact today, Topshop are launching their\nCapsule Collection: a range of clothes,\ndesigned in collaboration with the eco-friendly group Reclaim to Wear, made\nVogue en vert\nentirely from discarded materials including fashion industry surplus such\nas cut-offs.\nIn order to do some vital \u2018research\u2019, I\npaid a visit to the Oxford Street H&M\nand Topshop stores and although it\u2019s\ngreat that these green ranges have been\nlaunched, there was hardly any sign of\npublicity for them either in the shops,\nor in magazines or on TV. Sadly, sustainable fashion still doesn\u2019t seem to be\nconsidered glamorous enough to make\nthe headlines. Even more disappoint-ingly, Topshop\u2019s recycled range will\nonly be available at the Oxford Street\nstore. It seems that, although celebrity\nendorsements, and events such as Livia\nFirth\u2019s Green Carpet Challenge, encouraging celebrities to don recycled\nfashion items at red carpet events, are\nraising awareness on the issue of sustainable fashion, there just isn\u2019t enough\nenthusiasm from the big brands.\nOn the bright side, living in London,\nPart of the sustainable range at Topshop. Not sure how socially sustainable blue hair is, but it looks swagged out\nSadly, sustainable\nfashion still\ndoesn\u2019t seem to\nbe considered\nglamorous\nenough to make\nthe headlines\n\u201d\nmake\nmake\nes\nes\n\u201c\nSadly, s\nSadly,\nfashion\nfashion we have some of the best destinations\nfor vintage clothes shopping in the\ncountry, with places like Brick Lane\nand Camden market on our doorstep\nthere\u2019s plenty of opportunity to shop in\na way that\u2019s kind to the planet if not our\npockets. If you do have some free time\ntoday though, Topshop is the place to\nbe, their brand new range is the perfect\nexcuse to hit the shops, after all how often can you say you\u2019re shopping to save\nthe world!?\nFriday 15 June 2012\nBecky Gray\nLetter to the Editor\nIt\u2019s quite extraordinary how, by running for Gender Equality Officer on an\nabolitionist manifesto, and having the\nmisfortune to be male, one is assumed\nto be a troll or \u2018joke\u2019 candidate. I didn\u2019t\nwin the election, but I have no doubt\nI did much better as a result of these\nattacks. So helpful were they in fact, I\ndecided I didn\u2019t even need to campaign\n\u2013 they\u2019d done all the work for me.\nI am very much in favour of equal-ity. I despise discrimination in all its\nforms. For example, I abhor so-called\n\u2018positive\u2019 discrimination. In a merit-based society there should be no such\nthing \u2013 surely all discrimination is\nwrong?\nTo illustrate with an example: In\n1997, 101 female Labour MPs were\nelected to the House of Commons. It\nwas lauded at the time. But far from being a step forwards for equality, it was\ntwo massive steps backwards. Many of\nthese women were selected as Labour\ncandidates on the basis of all-women\nshortlists. That is to say, they were\nchosen otherwise than purely on merit.\nFar from empowering these women,\nit meant they could not look their colleagues (both male and female) in the\neye and say \u201cI\u2019m your equal\u201d because,\nquite simply, they\u2019re not. Compare and\ncontrast with women like Margaret\nThatcher, who was not selected based\non her gender, and who beat the grey-haired men at their own game \u2013 and on\nmerit. She is the real feminist.\nPerhaps where I differ from the\nstandard Student Unionist concept of\n\u2018equality\u2019 is that I sign-up to the idea\nthat people are individuals who should\nnot be assigned to \u2018groups\u2019 based on\ntheir sex, sexuality, or race. Indeed, I\nthink that doing so is a backwards step.\nThat is why I am against many of these\nOfficer posts in ICU which seek to assign people in such an unnecessary and\nartificial way.\nSurveys which ask me to \u2018identify\u2019\nmyself based on my race, orientation\nor gender are ignored. I will not be labelled in such a way. People, as free\nindividuals, identify themselves by\ntheir actions and deserve to be treated\naccordingly.\n\u2013 Christopher Kaye\nThe perfect excuse to get yourself to Topshop today!\nCat got your tongue?\nThere is always plenty of time to\nget involved, so relax. Oh, wait,\nhang on, the issue next week is\nthe last of the year. Okay, so if this\nyear you said you\u2019d write you should\nstart panicking like an Apprentice\ncontestant writing a CV.\nBasically, type up a bunch of your\nthoughts on a topic and send it to:\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe position of Gender Equality Officer\n\n"

While it was gone,\nI prayed for its return, thinking that\nanything had to be better than the\nmephedrone-fuelled roiders sadly so\ncommon on the Cardiff scene at that\ntime, and to some extent Bristol, the\nbeautiful last bastion of the rave scene.\nSadly, someone forgot to tell the\nnew kids that the beauty of E in the\n90s was the love and magic. A generation of teenagers whose views on\ndrugs have been distorted by the \u201cget\ncaned, do it hard\u201d mentality brought\non by the crystal-meth level fiendish-ness of mephedrone \u2013 at the time justified with cries of \u201cbut it\u2019s legal, it must\nbe fine\u201d \u2013 are now bombing half grams\nof MDMA and rolling around on the\ndance floor, eyes in the back of their\nheads, sweating buckets.\nMephedrone not only changed the\nclub culture at the time, but permanently altered it. It has changed the\nway that the young approach drugs.\nNothing manages to hit the highs that\nthe rush from drone provided, resulting\nin frequently ridiculous use of MDMA\nand other chemicals in the dreams of\never getting that high again. There\u2019s no\ndenying that drug use has always been\nan intrinsic part of the rave scene since\nits inception, but respect was also an\ninherent part of the scene up till even\n2 years ago; now, this bread and butter of the community has all but disap-peared.\nApparently everyone has forgotten\nabout PLUR. Peace, Love, Unity &\nRespect \u2013 the founding principles of\nthe early 90s free party scene. Nowadays, especially in London, the free\nparty scene seems to be populated by\nscumbags of two varieties: those who\nwant to get so hellishly muntered they\ncan\u2019t even dream of doing it in the\npublic eye, often on hard drugs; and\nthose who want to steal from and attack such muntered people.\nBristol remains one last fragment of\nthe original free party scene. In Bristol,\nthe people who own the rig control the\ndrug flow, and people help each other,\nnot hurt each other. Only soft drugs\nare sold; LSD and MDMA are most\ncommon. Ketamine is huge in Bristol,\nwhich is maybe less justifiable, but\ncertainly doesn\u2019t lead to comedown\ninduced rage. It\u2019s a sad night if you\nsee a fight at an illegal rave in Bristol,\nyet they are commonplace in London.\nI think it speaks volumes that it is necessary to have outside security to control the London raves, even with a rave\npopulous of only 100 or so.\nI hope the return of Ecstasy has\nchanged the illegal rave scene. So sickened by what I have seen, and burnt\nout after 4 years of clubbing/raving\nevery weekend, I do not attend such\nevents any more. Nowadays I spend\nmy Saturday nights playing bridge\nand doing problem sheets, not waiting\nwith bated breath for the party line to\ngo up. As such, I will never find out.\nI hope, however, that in this one area,\nwhere \u2018the heads\u2019 are so hardened that\nmephedrone didn\u2019t even begin to touch\ntheir drug use or change their mentality (nobody wanted any link with that\nnew, unresearched, legal rubbish), the\nreturn of MDMA has lead them to remember the good old days. I hope it\nbrings back the more innocent days of\nthe rave scene: when raves were about\npeople coming together, united by\ndance, a hatred of their jobs, and a hatred of the society that repressed them.\nEcstasy\u2019s big comeback\nSir Mandy Dimitri comments on the state of the today\u2019s drug scene\nWho\u2019s on when?\n7:00 - 8:00 Phrij\n8:00 - 8:40 Spank Alley\n8:50 - 9:10 Nipples\n9:20 - 10:00 Operation Midnight Climax\n10:15 - 11:00 Evermean\n11:15 - 12:00 Sun Glitters\n12:15 - 1:00 My Panda Shall Fly\nbourg to infuse our ears with blissful beats\ndoused in melodramatic atmospheres.

Regrettable as\nthe cancellation of the on-campus Formal\nDinner was to those preparing their own\nformal attire, the decision will not have\nan impact on the financial success of the\nevent, with the tickets having been sold at\ncost price.\nAlthough the dinner was to be held at\nthe lowest price available with College\ncatering, students, as reported in Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services) Michael\nFoster\u2019s Council Report, \u201cvoted with their\nfeet\u201d. This is unlikely to evolve into a stu-dent-led revolt, with events already being\norganised to hold pre-Ball events at other\nestablishments.\nAnd despite all of the controversy at this\nweek\u2019s Council and a lack of attendance\nat last week\u2019s General Meeting, it\u2019s worth\nremembering there have been a variety of\nsignificant outcomes from the Union this\nacademic year. That is, aside from Council\ndiscussing an issue for a significant period\nof time and not really getting anywhere at\nall.\nFollowing a new Impact Report detailing\nthe Union\u2019s recent successes, one can\nrecall the highest turnout across England\nand Wales for a Student Union election,\nwith an overall turnout of 41% across col-lege, with 58% of undergraduates and 19%\nof postgraduates voting. Next year\u2019s officers will be representing the largest mandate yet.\nVolunteering at Imperial has been given\na new lease of life with a new partnership\nbetween the Union and Student Hubs,\nwhich is discussed at length in this week\u2019s\nfeature.\nTechnological advances such as the\nlong-awaited lecture podcasting and note\nstorage facility NoteBox will be thoroughly\nintroduced following influence from the Union and suggestions of students.\nRepresentation has seen a boost following February\u2019s Love Your Rep week, with\nfurther support set to be provided to reps\nin the future.\nAnd a cash machine returned to Beit\nQuad, so that\u2019s a bonus right there.\nSo, while the usual Union hackery can\nnever truly be avoided, ultimately significant advances have arrived during this academic year. And anyway, it may well be a\npity that the Summer Ball won\u2019t be playing\nhost to a Formal Dinner may not be going\nahead, but at least there won\u2019t be a loss\ngenerating from it.\nSummer Ball so hard\nFormal Dinner can\u2019t find\nme\nIt seems like everyone suffers from the thoughtless acts of a minority. By which it is meant\nthe poor behaviour of individuals discussed in the article, not the people riding horses\n... it\u2019s not just the\nvictims of this\nabuse that suffer\nbecause of it.\nMen are treated\nlike dangerous\npariahs and are\nafraid to strike\nup conversation\n\u201c\n... it\u2019s n\n... it\u2019s\nvictims\nvictims\n\u201d\nrike\nrike\nation\natio\nT\nhis morning I realised that\nsomething has fundamentally gone wrong. Having\nfinished exams I was wandering around in Hyde Park\nafter a delicious coffee with a friend\nand noticed the horses from the Hyde\nPark barracks practicing. I went over to\nwatch and was being impressed by their\nformation horsing when a gentleman\nwith a huge smile came up and asked\nme what they were doing. My reaction\nwas a sinking feeling wondering how to\nextricate myself.\nThe reason? Over the last five years\ntravelling in London and around the\ncountry to visit friends and relatives, a\ngood proportion of approaches by lone\nmen have turned out to be excuses to\nharass, proposition and inappropriately\ntouch me for having the misfortune of\nbeing a lone traveller. There was the\noccasion on a packed train when the\ngentleman in the aisle seat chose to \u201ctest\nthe quality of my skirt\u201d \u2013 also known as\nstroking my thigh. On another occasion\na young gentleman spent three and a\nhalf hours incessantly enquiring how to\ncontact me; Facebook, my phone number etc. in spite of me asking to be left\nalone \u2013 apparently playing hard to get.\nOn one particularly repugnant occasion\nI was travelling with my younger sister\nand a gentleman accompanied by his\nteenaged son felt the need to proposition\nus and enquire after our sexual preferences and practices for a full two hour\njourney. We didn\u2019t have the heart to tell\nour grandparents what had happened\nupon arrival.\nOf course, the vast majority of journeys are uneventful and everyone conducts themselves appropriately, but as a\nresult of these unpleasant incidents I find\nthat every time my attention is drawn to\na lone man on public transport there\u2019s a\nsinking feeling that my journey is about\nto be disrupted. It\u2019s worth mentioning\nthat poor behaviour is not always directed at women, though the sexually motivated component in my experience is. I\nhave also seen a man headbutt another\nman for the audacity of using a shared\narmrest and two men removed from\npublic buses by police (on separate oc-casions) after becoming violent following the usual slight nudges which are the\nby-product of overcrowded transport.\nI focus on public transport as a particular problem area but in truth crowds,\nqueues and even our very own Union\nbars have all been areas where I have\nbeen touched inappropriately and without permission. When three gentlemen\nwho study at Imperial have all felt it OK\nto cop a feel without invitation I begin\nto believe that these men are everywhere\nand so upon being approached by a lone\nmale stranger my heart sinks. For the\nminority who are reading and may benefit from this information, I and everyone else will let you know if we want\nto be touched, propositioned or harassed\nby you. Please desist unless you receive\nthis information, it will be clearly sign-posted, you won\u2019t miss it!\nThe problem is that it\u2019s not just the\nvictims of this abuse that suffer because\nof it. Men are treated like dangerous\npariahs and are afraid to strike up conversations unless accompanied in case\nthey come across as interested for the\nwrong reasons and the little pleasantries\nthat can make public transport so much\nmore bearable become sinister to everyone due to an unacceptable minority.\nThe gentleman watching the horse\ndancing with me in Hyde Park was just\ncurious and I think a little put-off by my\nunfriendly demeanour. He ambled off\nafter a little while, resisting the need\nto proposition me or slip in a sexually\nthemed joke. Unfortunately I was less\nfriendly to that curious person just wanting to know who the horses were and\nwhy because some men out there simply\ndo not know how to behave.\nI\u2019d welcome any thoughts readers\nhave on this theme and particularly ideas\nas to what can be done about it! Perhaps\nif more of us showed our disapproval\nthese brutes would learn their behaviour isn\u2019t acceptable, I always find that\nthe pithy put downs come to me only\nafter the incident but in case inspiration\nstrikes you please don\u2019t hold back!\nIf you are\nprone to pa-percuts then\nnever fear.\nWe also have\na website.\nHead over to\nfelixonline.\nco.uk and\nread the\nentire paper\nonline. Sweet\nas a nut,\nsweet like\nTropicana.\n... I, and everyone\nelse, will let you\nknow if we want\nto be touched,\npropositioned or\nharassed by you.\nPlease desist\nuntil you recieve\nthis information\n\u201c\n... I, an\n...

The point is,\nlack of time is really just\na poor excuse. The real issue\nis that doing things of social value is\nnot currently embedded in our university culture. It is not yet the norm and\nso only those who are super pro-active\nare getting involved.\nSo should this change? Should socially beneficial activities be an important\npart of student life? Well, after thinking about this for a while (a few days),\nI\u2019m actually struggling to find reasons\nnot to get involved in socially beneficial activities. In the name of balanced\nargument, if anyone can think of something please let me know, but otherwise\nI am just going to go ahead and list the\nreasons why we should all be social\nwarriors. (Yeah I used the term \u2018social\nwarrior\u2019, what of it?)\n\u2022 To improve things and help people:\nBlindingly obvious. Doing something\nthat is good for the world makes you\nfeel good. Everyone\u2019s a winner. In fact,\n95% of students who do volunteer have\nA\ns the academic year\ndraws to a close, final\nprojects are handed in,\nand the last few exams\nare sat, it\u2019s only natural\nto reflect on the year gone by. Most of\nus have clocked up more library hours\nthan we care to remember and spent too\nmany nights in Metric that we wish we\nremembered more of. We\u2019ve all made\na new friend, learnt something new\nand had a new experience. As Imperial\nstudents, not only do we grapple with\nsome of the most academically challenging university courses in the UK,\nbut collectively, we also find time to\nrun over 300 different clubs and societies ranging from IC Rugby Club to\nDramSoc to CheeseSoc. As if this point\nneeds restating, but contrary to what\nyour academic tutor might tell you,\nuniversity is about much more than just\ngetting your degree.\nHowever, are we somewhat overlooking an important aspect of university\nlife here at Imperial? Ask yourselves\nthis simple question: have you done any\nvolunteering or other socially beneficial\nactivity over the past year? I know some\nstudents do an absolutely awesome job\nin terms of fund raising and volunteer\nwork, but are enough of us doing our\nbit? I, for one, must hold my hands up\nand confess to not having directly been\npart of any socially beneficial activity\nover the past academic year.\nSo this begs the question, why don\u2019t\nmore of us get involved in social activi-ties? And more to the point, should we\nbe getting more involved?\nIt\u2019s not hard to work out the number\none reason students give for not volun-teering: \u201cI don\u2019t have the time\u201d. In a\nnational survey on volunteering (per-formed by the National Co-ordinating\nCentre for Public Engagement), 79 per\ncent of all non-volunteers asked said\ntheir main barrier to volunteering was\na lack of time owing to study pressures.\nI could spend the rest of this article debating the time pressures on students\nand discussing what activities should\ntake priority but, to be frank, that would\nbe boring. Only the enviable minority\npossess that illusive skill of being able\nto successfully time manage. The rest\nof us, however, will forever be doing\nthose all nighters in the library the eve-said this is their number one motiva-tion.\n\u2022 Developing skills: The number and\ntype of skills that can be learnt through\norganising or being part of a socially\nbeneficial activity are endless. Furthermore, the icing on that cake is that talking about things you learnt whilst eg.\nvolunteering is interview conversation\nheaven. Employers love this kind of\nshit.\n\u2022 Gaining work experience / developing CV: Competition for internships\nand summer work has never been more\nfierce. If you didn\u2019t bag that investment banking internship, what better\nway to spend a summer than by getting involved in some charity work? I\nbet you\u2019d learn just as much, probably\nmore.\n\u2022 Meeting new people and making\nfriends: Self-explanatory. Who doesn\u2019t\nwant more friends?\n\u2022 To enhance learning from your university course: Why not tie in some\nsocially beneficial work with your stud-ies. Hey, we\u2019re all fairly good at science\nand maths, why not get involved in a\nmentoring program and share your passion (or \u2018passion\u2019as the case may sometimes be) with some younger people?\nSo this all sounds great. Well, at\nleast I\u2019ve convinced myself that I\nwant to volunteer some of my time\nto a good cause and hope, to some\nsmall extent, I\u2019ve convinced you too\nconsider doing so too. And so, apart\nfrom \u201clack of time\u201d, why are lots of us\nnot already involved in these kinds of\nactivities? Well, other commonly used\nreasons include lack of connection\nbetween volunteering and academic\nstudies or careers, and also lack of\nawareness about how to get involved.\nHowever, here at Imperial that\u2019s all\nabout to change\u2026\nThe Imperial Hub has arrived on\ncampus and is here to revamp the image of student powered social action.\nThe Imperial Hub will be the new\n\u2018go-to\u2019 point for students interested in\ndoing some kind of socially beneficial\nactivity. It will be linking up existing\nsocieties in this area, setting up new\nprojects and making it more fun, and\neasier than ever before to get involved.\nIn October we\u2019ll be welcoming the\nfirst set of students paying fees of\n\u00a39000 a year through our doors. The\npressure to perform academically will\nbe greater than ever before. However,\nthis shouldn\u2019t mean the quality of student life is compromised. Universities\nhave a vital role to play in supporting\nsocial, intellectual and cultural life\nof students, alongside their academic\nstudies.\nStudent activism has been the lifeblood of organic change in our society\nand it\u2019s down to us to make sure this\ncontinues. So whilst you\u2019re lazing on\na beach this summer, why not take 10\nminutes to think about how you can\nget involved in some kind of socially\nbeneficial activity next year? Let\u2019s\nsend a resounding message to the incoming freshers of 2012 that here at\nImperial students are about more than\njust the science.\n\u201cAre we overlooking\nan important aspect\nof university life?\u201d\nHistory of the Student\nHub\nStudent Hubs was founded in 2007,\noriginally in Oxford, by a group of students who had become frustrated at the\nlack of support for student volunteering\nand social action. A network of student\ngroups formed, each focussing on different social and environmental issues\n\u2013 such as climate change, development,\npoverty, education, and homelessness.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the Oxford Hub\nmodel was re-interpreted and tested in\nother universities, where students felt\nthe need to boost the culture of giving back and social action. In early\n2008, Cambridge Hub, Bristol Hub\nand Southampton Hub were founded.\nMore recently, in 2010 and 2011 both\na Brookes Hub and Warwick Hub were\nlaunched. And now, in 2012, Imperial\nCollege will be the first London University to launch a Student Hub.\nAbout the Imperial Hub\nImperial Hub provides support to students and projects, aiming to be the\ncomplete guide to events going on at\nImperial of an ethical, charitable or socially entrepreneurial nature.\nEvery Sunday Imperial Hub sends\nout \u2018The Week\u2019 to students subscribed\nto the Imperial Hub mailing list. This\nis an email summary of all the events\non campus with an ethical or charitable\nfocus, from talks to campaign actions,\nsociety meetings to conferences. You\ncan sign up by going to the Imperial\nHub website: http://www.imperial-hub.org/\nOver the next year Imperial Hub will\nbe organising weekly talks, setting up a\nnumber of activities for students interested in social enterprise, and, in November, will be holding The London\nClimate Forum, an entirely student-run\nconference on Climate Change and\nSustainability here in the Great Hall. If\nyou are keen to get involved in these,\nor any other activities then get in contact with the Imperial Hub Manager,\nRhiannon Horsley (manager@impe-rialhub.org) or one of the interim Imperial Hub Co-ordinators Steven Tran,\nPauline Vaskiou or Caroline Wood.\nImperial Hub will have a big presence on campus from October on-wards, but if you want to find out\nmore before about what it is before the\nsummer break, come and join us at the\nUnion on the from 5pm on Thursday\n21 June for the Imperial Hub launch\nevent.\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n79.2\n41.0\n28.1\n26.5\n21\n19\n17.7\n15.5\n15.5\n12.8\n12.7\n8.5\n8.4\n7.6\n3.4\nIllness or disability that prevents me\nNegative experiences in the past\nI just don\u2019t want to volunteer\nI\u2019d achieved the award or\ncertificate I set out to\nI don\u2019t feel part of the community here\nMy family/friends are not involved\nI think I\u2019ve done my\nfair share of volunteering\nI lost interest\nNot enough time \u2013 due to involvement\nwith other clubs, sports or societies\nI don\u2019t think I can afford to volunteer\nI don\u2019t know what I could offer\nI\u2018m not sure how to get involved\nNot enough time \u2013 due to family\ncommitments\nNot enough time \u2013 due to\npressures of study\nNot enough time \u2013 due to paid work\nPercentage of non-volunteers who did not volunteer because of this reason \u2013 Base: 1,141 (All non-volunteers)\nYou may have heard from friends at other universities that RAG is kind of a big deal for them, especially at universities such as Loughborough and Bristol.\nRAG, standing for Raising and Giving, is a student-run charitable fundraising organisation. Students\nacross the UK raise vast amounts of money for charity with their university RAG society every year. But\nwhere\u2019s the Imperial RAG presence? Well, there are\na few student groups that run RAG fundraising ac-tivities, namely the Medics and the Islamic society.\nBut generally student participation on RAG activities\nis poor.\nCurrent RAG Chair Jack Hewitt listed the following possible reasons for low student participation in\nRAG activities: lack of tradition, poor publicity, time\nconstraints, and a general \u2018can\u2019t be bothered attitude\u2019 of some Imperial students. However, he also\nwent on to note \u201cDave Goldsmith (next year\u2019s RAG\nchair) is bringing some new ideas forward, and with\nthe expansion of CAG (Community Action Group) and\nstable running of the RAG projects, the appropriate\nsteps are being taken for next year to be a big one!\u201d\nIf you want to get involved in fundraising and volunteer work, RAG is a great place to start!\nWhat about RAG?\nFacts and stats (from a study performed by the National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement)\n63 per cent of students have taken part in formal volunteering since starting university\n38 per cent of student volunteers are introduced to volunteering through their university or students\u2019 union\n48 per cent of volunteers give their time to formal volunteering activities that benefit the wider community but\nwithout receiving any support from their university.\n51 per cent of recent graduates under 30 years old who are in paid work say that volunteering helped them to\nsecure employment\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 15 June 2012\n22\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nFILM FILM\nFELIX Friday 15 JUNE 2012 23\n2012: Summer in Cinema\nThe Bourne Legacy \u2013 13 August\nThe fourth installment in the legendary Bourne series (based on Robert Ludlum\u2019s American spy novels about Jason Bourne), The Bourne Legacy is actually based on a later\nBourne book written by Eric van Lustbader. Although the plot of this latest movie has\nbeen kept tightly under wraps, a couple of trailers and some teasing quotes from the\nfilms production team have given us a few facts to work with. It has been revealed that\nMatt Damon \u2013 who played Jason Bourne in all three of the previous Bourne films \u2013 will\nnot be returning, and the stars of this film will include Jeremy Renner, Edward Norton and\nRachel Weisz. Directed by Tony Gilroy, eponymous hero Aaron Cross (Renner) is left to\nfight for his life \u2013 as well as many others\u2019, probably \u2013 against baddie Byer (Norton). Cross\u2019\nmission leads him to meet beautiful scientist (there\u2019s always a beautiful scientist) Marta\n(Weisz), who is involved in Byer\u2019s program. It seems that she and Cross head off on their\nmission, involving huge risks, death-defying actions, hints of a romance and several\nreferences to Jason Bourne. Renner promised that this installment would be bigger than\nthe previous three installments even though Damon isn\u2019t around. \u201cIt\u2019s the same tempo\nand pace but more expansive and bigger. The differences are pretty vast but you\u2019ll know\nit\u2019s a Bourne movie,\u201d said the actor.\nThis is it. Term is finished. No more coursework. Exams completed. Money coming in from jobs. It\u2019s\ntime to bask in the wonder of the summer. Oh wait \u2013 it\u2019s pissing it down. Luckily for you, we have\ncompiled a selection of the films to watch this summer. Film then pub?\nThe Dark Knight Rises \u2013 20 July\nDefinitely one of the most hotly anticipated upcoming films of the summer \u2013 the long-awaited Batman sequel is almost upon us. Directed yet again by Christopher Nolan, the\nlatest film promises to be just as epic as his previous attempts. Set eight years after The\nDark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises follows Batman\u2019s return to Gotham City after his time\non the run from the Gotham City Police Department (who think he is guilty of committing\nHarvey Dent\u2019s crimes from the last film... remember?). Back in his hometown, Batman\n(Christian Bale) encounters the villainous Bane (Tom Hardy) who plans to destroy Gotham\nby methods most horrible \u2013 makes a change, eh. Nolan said, \u201cWith Bane, physicality is\nthe thing.\u201d This is clearly true as the trailers show a brutal, bulked-up Hardy crashing\nhis way through several fights. Also around is Bane\u2019s \u2018associate\u2019, the mysterious and\nsomewhat feline Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), who is very catlike and a woman. Hint hint.\nMichael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman also reunite to form the old team in\nthis epic new adventure.\nMoonrise Kingdom \u2013 OUT NOW\nThis new comedy-drama from director Wes Anderson (Fantastic Mr. Fox) opened the\nCannes Film Festival this year, so it must be good. Set in the sixties in the USA, two\ntwelve-year-olds in love, Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward), run away from\ntheir New England island town, prompting a wide search led by the town\u2019s Sheriff and\nSuzy\u2019s parents. Sam is an orphan who visits the island while on a \u2018Khaki Scout\u2019 summer\ncamp, while Suzy is on holiday there with her dysfunctional lawyer parents, Walt (Bill\nMurray) and Laura (Frances McDormand). Sam and Suzy meet during a performance,\nand remain penpals over the following year. When they meet again the following summer,\nthey discover they are in love (aged twelve?!), and run away together on the island. The\nsubsequent hunt involves flashes of humour and teary emotion and you just that feeling its going to be a \u2018happily ever after\u2019 type of ending. The ensemble cast includes big\nnames such as Bruce Willis and Tilda Swinton, as well as the twelve-year-old newcomers\nHayward and Gilman. Consistently good reviews have led to this film being widely anticipated as the top family feel-good film this summer.\nLawless \u2013 7 September\nLawless is a western crime film directed by John Hillcoat with an all-star cast starring\nShia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska. The\nscreenplay was adapted from Matt Bondurant\u2019s novel The Wettest County in the World\nby the excellent Nick Cave, and has been met with excellent reviews after competing for\nthe Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes this year. Lawless is an embellishment of the true story of the\nBondurants brothers, bootlegging siblings who are keen to take the law into their own\nhands. The youngest, Jack (LaBeouf), fancies himself the next Al Capone. He ambitiously\ntakes the family\u2019s small-scale moonshining operation to the bigger leagues, to impress a\ngorgeous but extremely off-limits Amish girl. The middle brother, Howard (Jason Clarke),\nis the muscle, and eldest brother, Forrest (Hardy), reluctantly accepts the changing times\nwith grit, leading the family with determination against the beginnings of corporate greed.\nAn enigmatic and stunning Maggie (Chastain) comes to town with a secretive past, capturing the interest of Forrest. As their legend grows, so does the danger, and it\u2019s not long\nbefore the brothers must face the consequences of their transgressions.\nBrave \u2013 17 August\nBrave is the new Disney Pixar collaboration effort, and involved a major overhaul of Pixar\u2019s animation techniques; the Pixar animation system was rewritten for the first time in\ntwenty-five years to accommodate this film\u2019s special effects. Brave was written by Mark\nAndrews, Steve Purcell, Brenda Chapman and Irene Mecchi, directed by Andrews, Chapman and co-directed by Purcell. Princess Merida (voiced by Kelly MacDonald), strong-minded daughter of King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson),\nlives in the Scottish kingdom of DunBroch. A skilled archer, she is betrothed to one of the\nsons of the three Lords of DunBroch: Lords Dingwall (Robbie Coltrane), Macintosh (Craig\nFerguson), and MacGuffin (Kevin McKidd). Not keen on her arranged marriage, the princess is determined to be a free spirit, and when she defies one of the kingdom\u2019s oldest\ntraditions by sabotaging an archery contest between the three lords, she inadvertently\ncauses controversy and chaos throughout the land. In an attempt to try and sort things\nout, Princess Merida turns to an old wise woman to help change her fate, and, unfortu-nately, a curse is inflicted on Merida\u2019s family and kingdom. Merida must use her archery\nskills and her bravery to break the spell and save her family and kingdom. Clearly this is\ngoing to be a film packed with family fun and is definitely the one to take small kids to.\nSafety Not Guaranteed \u2013 9 August\nFrom the producers of Little Miss Sunshine and director Colin Trevorrow comes this wonderful little gem of a film, which was screened at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival\nwhere it won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. The story follows three highly cynical\nSeattle magazine employees, Jeff (Jake Johnson), Arnau (Karan Soni) and Darius (Aubrey\nPlaza), as they investigate an advert they see which reads: \u201cWanted: Somebody to go\nback in time with me. This is not a joke. You\u2019ll get paid after we get back. Must bring\nyour own weapons. I have only done this once before. Safety not guaranteed.\u201d Together,\nthe journalists embark on this very funny, smart and unexpectedly heartfelt journey to\nfind the loveable loner Kenneth (Mark Duplass), the paranoid checkout guy at the local\nsupermarket who is convinced he has solved the riddle of time travel and is preparing to\ndepart into the past again soon. Writer Derek Connolly keeps the story fresh, with lots\nof laughs and touching surprises, and a sterling performance from Plaza makes the film\none to put on the summer list.\nThe Amazing Spider-Man \u2013 3 July\nThis reboot of the Spider-Man franchise goes back to Peter Parker\u2019s roots, showing him\nstruggling as a teenaged social outcast as his super powers are evolving in high school.\nPeter (now played by Andrew Garfield) spends his days attempting to uncover the mystery of his parents\u2019 hidden lives and his own past \u2013 while also trying to win the heart of\nhis high school beau, the charismatic and rebellious Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Peter\ndiscovers a mysterious briefcase belonging to his father, who abandoned him when he\nwas a child, which leads him to his dad\u2019s former partner, Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans). The\ndiscovery of his father\u2019s secret leads to Peter\u2019s understanding and acceptance of his\ndestiny as Spider-Man, and brings him face to face with Connors, who becomes the\nvicious and vengeful Lizard. Due to the extremely high expectations surrounding this\nmovie, there was a strong possibility that this one wouldn\u2019t deliver \u2013 after all, a reboot is\nalways a risk. But despite the difficulties pleasing a vast number of comic book nerds,\nThe Amazing Spider-Man has an ace, fresh-faced cast, a brilliant soundtrack and amazing\nspecial effects: this film is bound to be a winner.\nThe Campaign \u2013 28 September\nSeeing as it\u2019s the latest Will Ferrell movie, you just know it\u2019s going to be a good\u2019un \u2013 after\nall, this is the genius that brought us Anchorman. Not only does it have Ferrell, but it also\nstars Zach Galifianakis (of The Hangover fame). When veteran congressman Cam Brady\n(Ferrell) commits a serious gaffe before the upcoming election, two vastly wealthy CEOs\ndraw up a scheme to put a rival candidate up against Brady in order to gain influence over\ntheir North Carolina district. They choose the slightly hapless and very na\u00efve Marty Huggins (Galifianakis), director of the local Tourism Center. With the help of the CEOs, a ruthless campaign manager and his family\u2019s political connections, Marty soon becomes a\ncontender to worry Cam. As election day draws closer, the two are locked in a dead heat\nand it seems that all they care about is burying each other, in this mud-slinging, back-stabbing, home-wrecking comedy from director Jay Roach (Meet the Parents) that takes\ntoday\u2019s political circus to the next, hilarious, level. While many critics have commented\nthat the characters are stereotyped and somewhat immature\u2026 we feel they have totally\nmissed the point. This film is amazing. Watch it.\n\n"

My ears weren\u2019t deceiving me but\nrather, all three of the hosts being big in the\ntwittersphere, they encouraged live tweeting\nthroughout the show. In what might\u2019ve been\nsomething of a mixed blessing, this meant that\nat times when your attention span was running\nshort you could readily reach for your phone\nfor distraction and it introduced a novel vein\nof audience interaction that I\u2019m amazed isn\u2019t\nused more widely.\nThe dynamic interplay between the trio\nmaintains the evening\u2019s high-tempo; the deadpan style of Matt Parker is counterweighted\nby the mischievous Mould whilst Arney adds\na touch of down-to-earth charm. Never at any\npoint in the night did I feel overwhelmed by\nthe science, making the experience a pleasant\nbreak from lectures. Instead what it offered\nare short digestible skits that draw on science\nenough to leave you feeling stimulated whilst\ntapping the comic potential of the day-to-day\nscience we commonly know.\nTo call it revision might be something of an\nexaggeration, but what it lacks in applicable\nexam knowledge it makes up in more subtle\nways. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in having had\nmy love of science tested during the trials and\ntribulations of an undergraduate degree. I came\nout of FOTSN with my chest puffed out and\n\ufb01lled with that fuck-yeah feeling that physics\nhadn\u2019t sparked in me for some time. We\u2019ve all\ngot a geek inside of us and it pays to indulge it,\nat least once in a while.\nYou can see FOTSN at this year\u2019s Edinburgh Fringe Festival from 1\u20137 August.\nWill Prince\nI used to loathe dancing. I was one of those people who stands in the corner looking awkward,\nrefusing to join the dance floor. However, in a\nmoment of daring I tried Latin American dancing and not that long after I found myself travelling one Sunday morning to the south coast for\nmy \ufb01rst competition.\nThe day got off to a bad start. I arrived at the\nHove Dance Centre with relative ease, rather\nsmug at having successfully negotiated National\nRail\u2019s replacement bus service. But as soon as I\narrived I started to notice that something was not\nquite right. The building was very small, its door\nwas locked, the lights were off, and the only\nsound I could hear was that of seagulls -- there\nwas evidently no dance competition here. After\na few frantic phone calls I ascertained that yes, I\nhad got the right date, but no I wasn\u2019t at the right\nplace; I was meant to be at the town hall over 2\nmiles away. When I \ufb01nally arrived, I knew I\u2019d\nmade it. Women in blindingly-bright sequined\ndresses and thick layers of makeup were rehearsing their moves in the lobby. I panicked. Not\nonly did they look terrifyingly good at dancing,\nbut I also realised that I was both under and over\ndressed for the occasion; underdressed because\nI hadn\u2019t stuck sequined jewellery on my forehead or greased back my hair, and overdressed\nbecause I was obviously wearing far too many\nsquare inches of clothing. I was then issued with\na marathon-style number to put on my back and\nfrom then onwards I was just \u201896\u2019.\nWhen it was time to dance all my apprehension vanished. As the music started playing I\nwas transported to Brazil and I remembered\nhow much I loved this type of dancing. Samba\nis a \u2018progressive\u2019 dance which means that you\ndescribe a circular shape around the room as you\ndance. Rather inevitably as we (my teacher and\nI) \u2018progressed\u2019 in front one of the adjudicators,\nmy routine \u2018progressed\u2019 out of my brain causing me to come to a rather embarrassing halt.\nNeedless to say I did not get through to the next\nround. However, spirits remained high since the\n\u2018pairs\u2019 event was yet to take place. I had been\npaired last minute with a charming Parisian\nwhom I was to Cha cha cha with. Seeing that the\nindividual events were taking some time, I took\nthe opportunity to take a stroll along the seaside\nand get something to eat. Hove looked beautiful,\nbathed in the \ufb01rst sunshine of the summer. Too\nbeautiful perhaps, as on my return it emerged\nthat I had embarrassingly missed the pair event,\nmy \ufb01nal chance to dance. I set off for home, dejected but convinced I should redeem myself at\nanother competition.\nWas the whole day worth it just for two\nminutes of dancing? De\ufb01nitely. It was great to\nsee so many dancers of so many ages enjoying themselves (there was a whole section for\n50 plus age group), and I picked up some tips\nabout how I should dress. I also saw dancing\nof the highest standard which was truly incred-ible. I certainly no longer have any inhibitions\non the dance floor. That is, when I make it there\non time.\nFor schedules of classes and competitions\nhttp://www.hovedancecentre.co.uk\nCha cha cha\nnear the beach\nStephanie Walton\nKeeping up with the Imperial ratio with FOTSN\nFelix Arts is constantly looking for new poets.

I was standing in the Now\nWave tent at Parklife Festival in Manchester,\nwhen all of a sudden Cupid\u2019s Arrow pierced my\nears. I turned to my friend beside me, and pointed towards the stage with my right hand, and\nsaid, \u201cThat is the coolest man I have ever seen\nor heard.\u201d The 1st class students among you will\nhave read the subtitle and figured out that I\u2019m talking about Tom Vek.\nThis will hardly be news to many of you. In fact\nmy friend\u2019s response to my hero-worshipping babble at the gig was, \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot. How do you not\nknow Tom Vek?\u201d (Presumably he was also thinking\nin his head, \u201cWhy am I friends with this fool...\u201d) So\nlet me put my hands up and apologise: I never noticed Tom Vek when he first burst onto the scene\nin 2005 \u2013 hell, I\u2019m pretty sure I was still listening\nto 50 Cent in 2005. Furthermore, I had no idea\nthat he disappeared for six years and I didn\u2019t prick\nup a single ear when he finally returned in 2011\nwith Leisure Seizure. But here I am, in June 2012,\nsaying that it\u2019s my Totally Hot Album of the Week\n\u2013 yep, that sentence sounded as pretentious as I\nthought it might\u2026\nThe reason I\u2019m risking hearing the words \u201cDude,\nwhere have you been?\u201d for the next week is that\nTom Vek\u2019s set at Parklife was just incredible. I felt\nlike I was in the Scott Pilgrim film and Vek was\nblasting awesome from his guitar. He looks like a\nperfectly proportioned wax copy of himself, with\nperfectly proportioned black glasses, a perfectly\ncut white t-shirt, and hair that looks like it\u2019s been\nnicked from a Ken doll. Whereas bands had been\nstruggling all day with poorly amplified vocals, his\ndeep but youthful voice cut through the tent like\na broad double-edged sword. And he danced like\nhe would if he was recording in his studio, like you\nwould if you were listening to his album in your\nbedroom.\nBut that\u2019s enough about Tom Vek, what about\nthe music. I can sum this album up in one sen-tence. It\u2019s the musical equivalent of meeting the\ngirl who pushes every single last one of your but-tons.\nIf you think that Tom Vek\u2019s earlier stuff was bet-ter, tweet \u201cHipster till I die\u201d @kadhimshubber. Failing that, tweet @Tom_Vek and advise him to get a\nrestraining order out on me\u2026\nit is definitely a welcome addition. As soon as\nI climbed the rickety stairs and started talking\nto the intriguing clientele, I knew this was the\ntype of totally cool place, full of character,\nwhich Central London was sorely missing.\nWith a free triple rum and ginger ale accompanying the very reasonable ticket prices (\u00a33 to\nbe exact), I was more than happy. For any of\nyou looking for a different night out, you need\nto check out Hotel Street. Notable gigs coming up soon include Crocodiles, Dee Dee from\nDum Dum Girls and Bo Ningen. For any of\nyou out there who are tempted, I urge you to\nthrow away your bunting, shoo away the cor-gis, put your leather jacket on and pay a visit\nto Hotel Street.\nsome dinghies on the River Thames this definitely was not. It is a long time since I have\nbeen to a hardcore gig or a punk club and from\nthe intensity of the show and the atmosphere\nof the whole night I am sure that my next appearance will be in matter of days rather than\nmonths. I would recommend DZ Deathrays\nto all of you if you want to let your hair down\nafter exams; down some shots of whisky and\ngo mental to the call to arms anthem of Rad\nSolar.\nNow I have extolled the virtues of the band,\nlet me explain to you the virtues of the newly\nopened venue. Hotel Street, owned by Sailor\nJerrys Rum, is the latest shoe-box sweatpit /\ndive bar / alt punk club to open in London and\nO\nver the past few weeks articles\ngushing about Queen Liz, explaining how the royal family represent everything good\nabout Britain and basically\ncelebrating the bloody grandness of the jubilee\nhave been abound. This is not one of those\narticles. During the past two weeks of media\noverdrive, which has been the build-up to the\njubilee, I have been reminded that I am in no\nway a monarchist. It was in this context that\nwhile others were painting union jacks on any\nsurface in sight or buying up extremely overpriced royal themed tat, ranging from cupcakes\nand tea-towels to condoms, I was attending a\nfantastic anti-jubilee party at the newly opened\nHotel Street venue on Charing Cross Road.\nThis party in question saw the Australian\nhardcore band DZ Deathrays headline to a\nsmall room full of enthusiastic punks and chin\nstroking hipsters. From watching their set and\na few clips on Youtube, it is very easy to comprehend what DZ Deathrays about: two really nice guys who love playing loud, visceral\npunk music, love to drink and, most of all, love\nto party. If you doubt any of these things check\nout the video for The Mess Up where a whole\nbottle of Jagermeister is consumed in under\nthree minutes. Their frantic set included some\nfantastic songs such as Teeth and Gebbie Street\nwhich really caught my attention. Some of the\ntracks, particularly some of the newer mate-rial, I could hear the band retreating slightly\nfrom their hardcore roots to something more\nfamiliar with Death From Above 1979.\nThe flailing limbs in the mosh pit attested\nto the energy which DZ Deathrays brought.\nEverything which the band threw at the crowd\nwas met with exuberant response with the floor\nvibrating heavily under the sheer excitement\nof it all. Let me tell you: a cold day watching\nTheir cameraman was never really that steady a shot\nI beg your royal pardon\nMark England watches the anti-jubilee celebrations go off with a bang\nKiller Mike\nR.A.P Music\nHot Chip\nIn Our Heads\nClams Casino\nInstrumental Mixtape 2\nCurrently on repeat\nSimon Hunter\u2019s favourite records of the past month\nWrite for Felix Music!\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n\n"

We\nall know Sarah Palin wasn\u2019t the best\ncandidate for the Vice Presidency. We\nhave all laughed at some of her worst,\nmost ridiculous answers during interviews and debates. Tina Fey of Saturday Night Live absolutely ripped Palin\napart and then Governor of Alaska was\nan international laughing stock. Now\nit\u2019s understandable for Palin to not\nwant to be reminded of such unflattering events, but branding the film as\n\u201creductive,\u201d and blaming the left-wing\nHollywood for making propaganda\nis ridiculous and does nothing for her\nalready diminished reputation. If any-thing, she should be grateful to HBO\nand Julianne Moore, for painting such\na human, balanced, and sympathetic\nbehind-the-scenes story of what must\nhave been an extremely difficult period\nin her life.\nMcCain (Harris) winning the Republican nomination to run for the 2008\nPresidential Race was an incredible,\nunpredicted victory for the Arizona\nSenator. Facing stiff competition from\nbig names such as Mike Huckabee,\nMitt Romney and Ron Paul, McCain,\nthe Vietnam war hero, was about to face\na relatively unknown young, inexperienced Senator of Illinois. But Barack\nObama, his opposing Democratic can-didate, had charisma, the star-power\nand appeal; something that was stealing away women, the independents,\nAfro-Caribbean, and first-time voters.\nMcCain\u2019s senior campaign adviser,\nSteve Schmidt (Harrelson) realises that\nwhat their camp needs is someone who\nwill bring back their spotlight, a game\nchanger, a woman.\nAnd so the search begins, and they\nfind Sarah Palin (Moore), the Governor\nof Alaska. She\u2019s attractive, conserva-tive, Christian, has five children, a son\nabout to be deployed to Iraq, and upon\nmeeting her, Schmidt is impressed by\nher love and support for McCain and\nhis campaign. This is where everything starts to go wrong. The initial\nexcitement starts clouding their judgement and their short-sighted ambition neglects to properly vet the Vice\nPresidential nominee. It normally takes\nweeks to carry out a proper background\ncheck. They finish in days, and settle on\nthe popular consensus that she embodies exactly what they need to make it\nto The White House. The Republican\nConvention in which she formally accepts the invitation from her running\nmate is an instant hit with the political\npundits and crowds alike and the team\nis more than ecstatic to hear that CNN\nhas put them on equal level with the\nObama-Biden camp.\nNicolle Wallace (Sarah Paulson), an-FELIX\nFriday 15 June 2012\n20\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nFILM FILM\nFELIX Friday 15 JUNE 2012 21\nother senior advisor of the campaign\nhowever, is not convinced and is sure\nthat the Governor struggles on answering foreign policy questions. Palin\ncannot answer why North and South\nKorea are divided, she is unaware of\nthe fact that Queen Elizabeth II is not\nthe head of government in the United\nKingdom, and she believes that it was\nSaddam Hussein who was behind 9/11.\nIt would be safe to say that she doesn\u2019t\nquite know the difference between the\nIraq war and the war in Afghanistan.\nBut is this really her fault? She was a\nsmall-town Governor with hardly any\nforeign-relations experience. The fact\nthat she was thrown into the spotlight\nwithin days, being under pressure from\nnationally-broadcast interviews must\nhave been an unimaginable challenge.\nThe excessive load of information\nand endless long hours take their toll,\nsomething Palin simply was not prepared for. She tries her best for the most\nparts, and yet the 24-hour news cycle\nbrutally destroys her image, naming\nher as an incompetent, inexperienced\nidiot, constantly undermining her every move. And Moore, not only looking and sounding almost to a freakish\nlevel as the Governor, also captures the\ncomplex person behind all the media\ncoverage. The pain of being away from\nher family for a long time, harassed by\nthe media who love making fun of her,\nthe difficult questions she faces from\ninterviews all build up to an inevitable\nseries of mini breakdowns.\nShe wasn\u2019t ready for this mass media\nshowdown nor was she prepared for\na campaign of this major scale, and it\nwas a reckless move to include her in\nthe first place. Throughout the film she\ncannot stop focusing on Alaska, clearly missing the only state she has ever\nknown, and her obsession for her approval ratings in her home state begins\nto interfere with the campaign. Her\nlonging for her home, her \u201cbabies\u201d may\nseem stubborn and selfish, but at times\ncan be heart-breaking to watch. McCain may have lost the Presidency, but\nPalin was the ultimate victim, unfairly\ndismissed and played as nothing but\nan advertising face for the Republican\ncampaign. Moore is simply outstanding\nhere, in a very fairly written role, and\nis successful in bringing out the untold,\nyet completely understandable background story that gives a fuller picture\nof the one-sided, Palin-bashing version\nof the election we\u2019re all used to by now.\nPalin does have her highlights how-ever. Immediately after the announcement of her candidacy, the donations\nfor the campaign sky-rocket, women\nand mothers love her, and she even\nholds her own in the first and only Vice\nPresidential Debate against the more\nexperienced opponent, Joe Biden. The\nsuccesses bring her ambition and she\nbecomes less cooperative in certain ar-eas. She knows how important she is,\nand this makes her unpredictable, \u201cgoing rogue,\u201d which incidentally is the\ntitle of Palin\u2019s autobiography released\nafter the 2008 elections.\nAlthough anchoring mainly on\nMoore\u2019s award-worthy performance,\nGame Change has impressive supporting players who should also be getting\nsome attention come awards-season.\nThe ever-so reliable Harris is convincing as the worried candidate being\nassociated with the not so flattering\nlegacy George W. Bush has left for him\nto pick up. And the hilariously serious\nand often foul-mouthed but straight-shooting Harrelson is spot-on as the\nambitious campaign director. Paulson\nis also excellent as the only other noticeable female in the group, quickly\nsussing out Palin\u2019s problems and being\nupfront and honest about it, rather than\ntrying to sweep the problems under the\nrug.\nWhat is more striking about Game\nChange is how honest it is about the depiction of modern day politics. It\u2019s shal-low, superficial and utterly misguided\nin places. They love Palin one minute,\nand hate her the next. Even the campaign staff changes their minds about\nher frequently. She does one good interview and they flock to her, applaud\nher, and call her a genius. She makes a\nmisstep, they\u2019re all against her, with secret meetings behind closed doors criticising her in the most unflattering ways.\nIt\u2019s no wonder she struggled to keep it\ntogether throughout \u2013 it must have been\na tricky environment to settle into, not\nknowing who your friends are, and how\nunpredictable the public response can\nbe. How truthful all the events that are\ndepicted here are still up for debate. But\nthe important thing is Game Change\noffers a new perspective on a story we\nall thought knew well. And so please, if\nyou\u2019re only shunning this film for political reasons, open your mind a little\nand be amazed and surprised by how\nengrossing and fair the film really is.\nJohn Park\nDirector Philip Kaufman\nScreenwriters Jerry Stahl, Barbara\nTurner\nCast Nicole Kidman, Clive Owen,\nDavid Strathairn, Molly Parker,\nRobert Duvall, Parker Posey\nHemingway & Gellhorn\nTime to play spot the difference......\nErnest Hemingway (Owen), love him or\nhate him, is regarded as one of history\u2019s\ngreatest, most respected authors of all\ntime, and is a name that will be heard\nmany times over. But HBO\u2019s new ambitious television film Hemingway &\nGellhorn instead puts its focus on the\nother more prominent name in the title;\nMartha Gellhorn (Kidman). Starting\nwith a close-up shot of a barely recognisable Kidman who has clearly been\ngiven a heck of a lot of fantastic make-up, the grumbling, low-pitched voice\nof our film\u2019s heroine kicks of the nar-ration. This story is about wars. And\nthere were oh so many of them. Their\npassion started during the Spanish Civil War, and it was a chance meeting that\nwas to change their lives forever.\nFor a magazine writer with no experience in a war zone, what gets Gellhorn interested in war correspondence\nis her firm belief and passion in jour-nalism, and it has very little to do with\nHemingway or anyone else who embark on the trip with her. She is determined to tell the story in the point of\nview of the victims, the tragic loss of\ninnocent lives that happen in any bat-tlefield. Hemingway, married, although\nnot too happily, to his second, devout\nCatholic wife (Parker), is pressured to\nsit this one out. The ever-so outgoing,\nmasculine author however is immediately taken by the sassy, brave and keen\nwoman, so willing to put herself in the\nline of fire for the purpose of reporting.\nBefore you know it, the passionate affair starts in the midst of an air strike\nof all places.\nIt is a true testament to HBO and its\nobvious high-standard reputation that it\nmanaged to attract such talented, internationally acclaimed stars for the iconic lead roles. And in those challenging\nroles, the pair does not disappoint. Kidman, resembling her real-life character\nin terms of their shared uniquely tall\nstature, doesn\u2019t pay too much attention\nin trying to mimic the smallest gestures or mannerisms of Gellhorn, but\nis always the class-act in portraying the\nsomewhat na\u00efve and impulsive courage\nin a wholly new environment. Women\nare bombed just the same as men, is\nher philosophy, and firmly establishing herself as one of the, if not the first\nfemale war reporters, was a pioneering\nwork in journalism that everyone was\nso rightfully impressed by. Kidman,\none of very few working actresses who\nhas the ability to use her old movie star\nglamour to full advantage especially in\npast-setting films like this one, does so\nwith plenty of grace and beauty.\nOwen, always hilariously waving\naround a bottle of any alcoholic drink\nthat captures Hemingway\u2019s notorious\ndrinking capacity, is always a large,\noverbearing presence on screen, dominating with his brute, masculine charm.\nHis disdain for snobby critics, terrible\nHollywood adaptations of his novels,\nare all resoundingly clear, as is the wild\npassion the two share. Eventually his\ndivorce from his second wife is final-ised, and it appears the pair could experience a lifetime of happiness.\nTheir doomed love affair originally\nstarts in Spain, but Gellhorn\u2019s passion\nfor war correspondence never ends\nthere. Her rise in popularity, although\nalways overshadowed by her status of\nbeing Mrs. Hemingway, takes her to\nplaces such as Sweden, China, and to\nthe important battlegrounds of the Second World War, much to the dismay of\nher newly wed husband. He does accompany her to China, but he pushes\nthings too far when it is revealed he\ntried to hijack her assignment in Europe. He is dissatisfied that his woman\nis travelling all over the globe for such\nlong periods of time, neglecting her\nown husband, whereas she is not the\ntype to let anyone get in the way of her\ntrue calling; a volatile combination that\nhas no realistic chance of surviving,\nwhich explains how Gellhorn was the\nonly wife of Hemingway (he had a total number of four) to outright ask for\na divorce.\nEven as a television movie with a limited budget, the intensity and authentic\nlook of the film, its intricate focus to\ndetails make this two-hour-and-a-half\nadaptation all the more worthwhile.\nThere is a lot of grainy documentary-style footage shots incorporated into its\nstorytelling, and although this lacks the\nexplosive or large-scale action scenes\nthat may be a gold-standard requirement for a film set during many different wars, the film makes the clever\nchoice of never actually showing the\naudience any direct war-related vio-lence, but only its terrible aftermath,\nand surrounding the central characters\nin noise, dust and general chaos.\nThe fact that this spends so much\ntime on the less well-known Gellhorn\nmay be a put-off factor for some: because even here, Ernest Hemingway\ncomes across as the more dynamic,\ncomplex and unpredictable figure, with\nGellhorn merely painted as a victim\nof her husband\u2019s many eccentricities.\nThe struggles of being married to such\na competitive intellectual who drinks\nlike a fish are told with heartfelt conviction backed by a stirring performance\nfrom Kidman but the same old ideas do\ngrow thin, and there is a noticeable lack\nof mention in Hemingway\u2019s literary ca-reer. He credited Martha Gellhorn as\nhis inspiration in completing his novel\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls, and yet the\nonly glimpse of the book the audience\ngets to see is Hemingway frantically\ntyping away at his typewriter during\nhis time caught up in the Spanish Civil\nWar.\nDiving into Gellhorn\u2019s character is\nmostly done through the convenience\nof many voiceovers, always completed\nin sweeping scenes of grandeur. Gellhorn explains the fall of Spain to the\nhands of the Nationalists (the side she\nand Hemingway were desperate to\noppose and overthrow), and what the\nGermans left behind in one of the concentration camps towards the end of\nWorld War II were the two key events\nthat made her lose faith in humanity.\nAlthough the film does everything it\ncan to show the more human aspect of\nthe iconic literary couple, what it truly\nlacks is insight into their much lauded\nand accomplished careers. So she goes\nwherever there is war. But once we\nplace the protagonists in a war zone,\nwe witness very little actual journalism but more of the bickering couple\nescalating towards total meltdown. The\nfilm is more interested in covering the\npassion, the ups and downs in the fiery\ncouple. In summary what we are told\nin yet another voiceover is that they\nneeded wars in their lives to survive\nand to stand one another. Because it\nwas in a war zone that brought out the\nbest in both of them. Without one, they\njust went on to create their own self-destructive ones.\nSo anyone expecting a deep, analytical exploration of Hemingway\u2019s or\nGellhorn\u2019s writing methods and styles\nwill find nothing of use here. Instead\ntry settling for a handsome, lavish production that chronicles the brief but\nturbulent and at times estranged married life these two fascinating people\nshared. The rich and colourful setting,\nconvincingly evoking the many scener-ies of the 1940s, adds a superbly pristine and polished look to a sumptuous\nand highly risky, expensive-looking\npiece. And it\u2019s a gamble that almost\npays off thanks largely to the brilliance\nof Kidman and Owen. Now if only a\nfraction of its healthy running time had\nbeen better spent, branching out further\ninto themes not involving love and re-lationship, the film could have been a\nmore dynamic ride.\nSpot the difference round two: this one is slightly easier\n\n"

It appears that computing,\nstereotypically the domain of the digital, has\nacquired a life of its own.\nBio-inspired computing is not, however,\na new discipline, with founding father Alan\nTuring basing his work on the fundamental\nquestion of whether a computer could ever\nthink like a human. The idea that evolution\ncould provide a framework for computational\nproblem solving has been around since the\n1950s. Less of a strict field than a philosophy,\nbio-inspired computing refers to a network of\ninterrelated areas of study including robotics,\nartificial intelligence and evolutionary compu-tation. These areas and the people who study\nthem are blurring the boundaries between nature and computer.\nIn this field, it is the computer that takes con-trol. Rather than the programmer telling the computer what to do (the top-down approach), a bot-tom-up, decentralised system allows computing\nsystems to employ \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 principles to create their own solutions to problems.\nWhich brings us back to slime. Andrew\nAdamatzky is from the appropriately named\nInternational Centre for Unconventional Computing at the University of the West of England\nin Bristol, where in a recently published paper he showed that the slime mould Physarum\npolycephalum can be used to help calculate the\nshape of a polygon linking on a surface. This\ntask is essential for the development of sophisticated graphics in gaming and films.\nUsing \u2018Kalms\u2019 sleeping tablets as an unusual\nattractant for the slime to spread its tentacle-like protrusions across a plastic plate, the slime\nhas to use as little expenditure as possible to\ncover as many points as it can \u2013 essentially,\nthe mould is playing a game of connect the\ndots that can be translated into computational\nefficiency. \u201cPlasmodium\u2019s foraging behaviour\ncan be interpreted as computation,\u201d explains\nAdamatzky in a recent press release, \u201cwhen\ndata are represented by spatial configurations\nof attractants and repellents, and results by\nstructures of protoplasmic network.\u201d\nIt seems that computational systems derived\nfrom biological principles have found their\nniche in the graphics, art and gaming spheres.\nVarious scientists have used the principles of\nevolutionary computation for aesthetic effect,\nfrom Maarten H. Lamers, whose \u2018hybrid biological-digital\u2019 games integrate real biological\norganisms inside computer games, to Simon\nColton at the Computational Creativity Group\nat Imperial College London. Colton\u2019s work, recently featured on the BBC\u2019s Horizon, showed\nthat computers could be used to make artwork\nso complex it appeared to have been created by\na human. The main aim of the group at ImpeThe future is unconventional\nFELIX\nFriday 15 june 2012\n8\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nInspired by Iron Man\nA first year Physics student at Imperial has applied\nfor a patent on a new way to make electricity. Felix\nScience caught up with inventor Marvin Tan Xing Haw\nto find out all about his (as yet hypothetical) device\u2026\nCould you tell us a bit about your invention?\nIt produces electricity, with power output between\nthat of a betavoltaic battery and a nuclear fission\nreactor. The power output is unknown because nobody has published the results of its computational\nsimulation yet. It works very much like a fission reactor and a betavoltaic battery.\nFission reactors sustain a chain reaction by using\nneutrons to induce the fission of Uranium-235. This\nin turn generates even more neutrons. Betavoltaic\ncells utilise the beta radiation from the natural decay\nof beta-radioisotopes like Tritium, and these beta\nparticles transfer their energy to electrons in a diode\nand thus induce a voltage and current.\nThe use of a semiconductor diode to convert energy from beta particles to electricity is analogous\nto using a diode as a solar cell (converting sunlight\nto electricity). Combing fission and betavoltaics,\nneutrons are used to artificially induce fission in the\nbeta-radioisotope, forcing the latter to produce more\nbeta particles than it would if it relied purely on beta\ndecay. It\u2019s analogous to force-feeding a goose that\nlays golden eggs so that you get more eggs!\nHow did you come up with the idea?\nI was really inspired last year after watching Iron Man\nand Iron Man 2. The world needs a small but powerful energy source like Tony Stark\u2019s Arc Reactor. How\nare vehicles going to be propelled after petroleum\nruns out? After daydreaming long and hard about the\ncurrent technologies that can approximate Stark\u2019s\nArc Reactor, I thought of combining the best of both\nfrom fission and betavoltaics.\nHow far into development are you?\nThe design needs to be perfected via computational\nsimulation to find the optimal thickness and concentrations of the isotopes. Then, it needs to be tested\nexperimentally. I don\u2019t have the resources to carry\nout these two modes of research, so I\u2019m stuck at the\nconceptual stage.\nHave you had any interest from scientists who\nthink this could work?\nSome scientists told me that the idea is interesting,\nbut they said they\u2019re too busy with their own work\nand hence don\u2019t have the time to explore it. Patent\npublications are not as widely read as research jour-nals, so until a journal article has been published\non my work, it\u2019s hard to capture the attention of the\nscientific community.\nFinally, do you have any tips for any students who\nmight have an idea they\u2019d like to develop?\nKeep it top secret until your patent specification has\nbeen published. It\u2019s stressful to balance your time\nbetween writing your patent specification and studying for an undergraduate degree, so time management is important. Also, use an image editor with\nlayering capabilities (like Adobe Photoshop) to draw\nyour patent diagrams.\nrial is in fact to create software that can take on\n\u2018creative responsibility\u2019, either autonomously\nor in collaboration with humans, to create art\nand science projects.\nHowever there are many other applications\nfor this rapidly diverging discipline.As research\nfellow Cameron Browne, from the Computational Creativity Group explains, \u201cComputational creativity applies to any creative field.\nAt the International Computational Creativity\nConference in Dublin a couple of weeks ago,\nwe saw all sorts of applications including com-puter-generated poetry, jokes, Mexican legends\nwith automatically illustrated codices, even automatically generated recipes.\u201d\nIt is an easy scaremongering tactic to employ\nthat the closer we get to true artificial intelligence the bigger the risk that the machines will\nturn against their makers. However it seems\nthat as we use natural mechanisms to improve\nthe efficiency of computing, art and cultural\nproducts made by computers may become the\nnorm. As Adamatzky puts it, \u201cUnconventionality\u2019 is relative. What is \u2018unconventional\u2019 today will be \u2018conventional\u2019 tomorrow.\u201d\nHelen Wilkes takes a look at computing inspired by biology\nNew microbial lifeforms have been discovered on the slopes of high-altitude volcanoes\nin the Atacama desert, South America, an area\npreviously thought inhospitable. Temperatures\nrange from -10\u00b0C to 56\u00b0C, and incident ultraviolet radiation is twice that at sea level in the\nextremely arid areas where researchers from\nthe University of Colorado took soil samples\nat over 6000 metres above sea level.\nSurprisingly, DNA analysis of the samples revealed bacterial and fungal lifeforms, although\nfar fewer and with less diversity than what is\nfound in other soils. The lifeforms, which have\nnot yet been fully characterised, are at least 5%\ngenetically different from other species, and express no genes known to be involved in photosynthesis nor contain chlorophyll, leaving their\nmetabolism a mystery. It has been suggested\nthat they may feed off gases such as carbon\nmonoxide and dimethyl sulphide, and remain\ndormant except for the rare occasions on which\nwater is provided by snowfall.\nThe terrain of the Atacama region has been\ndescribed as \u201cMars-like;\u201d however, as Mars\nlacks an ozone layer, the level of UV radiation\nits surface receives is much greater than even\nhigh-altitude points on Earth. Nonetheless, investigation into the metabolism of these new\nlifeforms may give clues as to how life may\nsurvive on other planets, or be a starting point\nfor designing life to survive in spacecraft or on\nMars in projects such as the NASA Institute of\nAdvanced Concepts mission to engineer plants\nwhich could provide food and oxygen to astronauts on future journeys to Mars.\nDOI:10.1029/2012JG001961\nExtremophiles found in Atacama\nKeir Little\nThe Atacama desert\nSlime mould grows to find an optimum networks and tends to mirror transport networks\n\n"
