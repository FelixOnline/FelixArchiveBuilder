    "content": "FOXES HOLE Philosophically Speaking\nTraditionally this is a term when every\none settles down to some work and everything stands a fair chance of falling\napart. Well, I haven't fallen apart yet, but\nhave you? Involvement is something that\nall four of the college unions spend much verbiage expounding, but is it, in the\naverage student's interest if the the Union becomes a distraction rather than an attraction?\nWhat Iam calling for is awareness.\nDon't wander round like a1980's version\nof Tommy (for pinball substitute space\ninvaders). You aren't blind, deaf or dumb,\nthough most IC students do give that\nimpression.\nI can understand people being dissatisfied\nwith I CU,I don't think it \" walks on water\" either. What I can't understand is\nthe way people can drift on the tide\nwithout so much as an attempt at altering\nthe course.\nGary Nichols posed the \" What is a Hack?\" question. Well, it is difficult not to\nbecome a hack when you spend more\nthan twelve hours most days up to your\npits in Union biz, but I do believe that\n'hack dom' is more a state of mind than a state of being. I must say that I have\ndeliberately avoided steeping myself in the\nmystique of Standing Orders and Procedural Motions, but I can feel\nhack dom coming on WUS \u2014 IC THIRD WORLD SCHOLARSHIP\nThis is designed to fund a student from\nthe Third World on a relevant MSc course, and it will come as a great\nsurprise to the few of you who have been\npestered to the point of bankruptcy that\nTHE BRAIN\nDRAIN\nANYONE WANT A JOB?\nIs there anyone who hasn't got a job\nfor next year yet who:\n(1) likes working for long, irregular\nhours.\n(2) must live on campus (in order\nthat people can come to see you or\nring you up at any time of the night).\n(3) enjoys working on committees (33\nat the latest count, and you can even\nbe chairman of six of them).\n(4) is prepared for drunken idiots in\nthe bar threatening to push your face\nin.\n(5) doesn't mind having people constantly moaning to you about what you're doing about bar and refectory prices, etc.\n(6) people doing the same as (5)\nbehind your back (but ten times as\nmuch).\n(7) likes having dustbin fulls of mixed Mooney/ abattoir/ fish market slops\npoured over their head to raise\nmoney for Rag.\n(8) doesn't want to earn much money.\nWant to be a Deputy President?\nso far ICU has only raised \u00a3800. That is\n17p per student. Seventeen pence per\nstudent? Please will you give some. more money. Simply the price of a beer from\nhalf the ICs tudes would raise \u00a3950.\nThere will be a preliminary meeting of a group to organise further collections in\nmy office at 12:45 next Thursday.\nDISAFFILIATION\nAs vo u probably know both Kings and Reading have dist hinged from the NUS, this means that ICU is no longer alone in\nthe outside. It will be very interesting to\nsee if any other universities follow suit\nand whether NUS can adapt to the financial implications.\nBBC\nI hope that those who went to the\nRadio 4 recording of the News Quiz\nenjoyed it. There will a further recording\non21 st February. Free tickets are available from the IC Union Office.\nMEGALOMANIA (POST UGM)\nI have always had tendencies towards\nthis unfortunate mental condition but now\nIam determined to let it get out of hand.\nThe inference at the U GM that I spend\nmy whole time writing letters to foreign\nregimes is totally untrue.\nYes, I do write letters, as and when a concerned union or sub-committee sees\nfit, these letters, however, take a small\nfraction of mine and the permanent staff's time. Meetings, and general administration,\ntake up far more. Of course I care about\nthe services that the Union and College\noffer. It is ironic that I had proposed a major change in the Union sub-structure\nto increase the Union hand in this area\njust minutes before this attack.\nAnyway, must stop now. I'm playing\nsquash with President Tito tonight!\nChris You must be off your fg head. Stand\nfor Hon Sec, or President, or something\nelse silly like that.\nSeriously, anyone taking on a Sabbatical\nUnion office expecting it to be a dos s would\nget a very nasty surprise. Getting involved in the Union can be enjoyable,\nbut being full-time makes a big difference;\nyou' re expected to work twenty four hours a day, and wherever you go in\nCollege people moan at you. Of course\nthere are some advantages; you can lead\na hectic social life (it would be difficult to\navoid this), which can be fun, and if you want to go into a management career\nwhen you leave the experience you gain\nin the Union may enhance your job prospects. Just remember that doing a sabbatical is mainly work, worry, and more work \u2014 you' re basically cheap labour.\nAnyone still seriously considering standing for DP should come and see me\nto learn more about what is involved\nsometime soon.\nANYONE WANT AN EASIER\nJOB?\nBetter paid too! I need someone to\nmake up curtains from material I'm going\nto buy for a Union room. I CW A have a sewing machine. Come and see me in the\noffice sometime.\nWANTED: ONE CHAIRMAN,\nUNION GENERAL MEETINGS\nAt the UG Mon Thursday 13th March, elections will be held for various IC Union posts including U GM Chairman. Papers will\nbe going up on Thursday the 28th of this\nmonth.\n1979-80 has been the first full academic\nyear of this job's existence, holders having\nbeen Malcolm Brain (last academic year)\nand myself.\nIn theory, all one has to do as Chairman is\nto sit there and announce which item of\nbusiness comes next, ask for speeches and say whether the motion (etc) is passed or\ndefeated. For some reason, though, it never\nreally works out like that tin d even the\nessential familiarity with Standing Orders doesn't remove the need to 'live on your\nwits' when things get conflicted. There are\nstill many 'grey areas' in the Standing\nOrders (eg length of speeches!) and much is\nleft to the Chairman' s discretion.\nI have found that the more you understand about what's going on, the\neasier the job becomes \u2014 so 'reading up' on motions and amendments beforehand is\nuseful \u2014 especially when one is called to\nmake a decision on' a move to vote',\n'question be not put' or 'take it in parts'\nprocedural motion.\nAlthough motions must be submitted to\nthe Hon Sec seven days beforehand to be\nguaranteed a place on the Agenda, the\nChairman may subsequently accept motions and amendments at his discretion.\nSo here's the bottom line \u2014 no one has\nyet approached me about standing \u2014 if you do plan to stand for U GM Chairman, I might\nbe able to pass on some useful hints.\nMick Berry FIRE EXTINGUISHERS\nIt's been pointed out to me that a lot of\nstudents probably live in a flat with others, all having various valuable items in\nrooms with no fire insurance, who might\nlike to club together to buy a fire\nextinguisher. I can get some at a discount\nprice \u2014 anyone wanting to place an order\ncan see me in the Union Office.\nMULTIGYM\nThe multi gym should arrive sometime\nin March and will be kept in the Sports\nCentre. It will be available for anyone to\nuse for weight-training or just general\nkeep-fit exercises.\nEntry to the Sports Centre is 15p but is\nfree for members of Weights Club( membership El.OOpa).\nVANDALISM/THEFT\nSomeone has broken the lock on one\nof the Du rex machines in the gents' toilets in the Union. I take a dim enough\nview of people accidentally smashing things whilst they are pissed out of their\nheads; I like thieves even less. Anyone caught will be handed over to the police\n(eventually), banned from the Union for\nlife and publicly ostr aci sed in FELIX, their\ndepartment informed, and anything else I can think of at the time.\nYou have been warned!\nMalcolm\n11\n\n"

    "content": "MOONEY WINS RADIO\nNEWS QUIZ\nThe' NEWS QUIZ' panel game programme that the BBC recorded in the\nUnion Concert Hall on Thursday was\nbroadcast early Saturday afternoon. During the programme the College was mentioned\nseveral times; but the most interesting point\nwas when the word' Mooney' appeared in\none of the questions, which elicited a large\ncheer from the audience. However, when\nBarry Took, the question master, asked the\naudience what the significance of the word' Mooney' was, Chris Fox, ICU president,\nshouted out, \" Don't tell him\". The programme was repeated on\nMonday and the BBC will be returning to\nImperial later this term to record another\nedition of the quiz. ' Mooney' won last\nweeks quiz and the producer is hoping to\nwrite him into the script of the next\nprogramme to be recorded at IC. Not a great deal has occurred within\nthe confines of the RS M since my last\nmasterpiece so I 'll restrict my babbling s to\nevents in the near future.\nTONIGHT at 6:00pm till late, Chaps Club Indoor Fete in Stan's Real Ale Bar.\nFun for the all the family and everyone\nelse who comes along.\nOn Tuesday12 th February is the\nR SMUG M. This time there will be aUG M in G20 at 12:30pm. Also on the\n12th February is the R SMA Curry Super\nwith beer. It is free for ALL second years\nin the RS M, who should have received\npersonal invitations by now. This a good\nopportunity to see how the Old Students'\nAssociation works and to meet some of\nits members.\nFriday 15th and Saturday 16th February\nis Camborne Weekend. Unfortunately all\nthe tickets have been sold.\nSunday17 th February is ANDY LEWIS' BIRTHDAY. On Saturday 1st March there' s the Nottingham Rugby Sevens Tournament and on Monday3 rd March there's the Swimming Gala, so don\nyour webbed feet and inflatables and get\ninto training.\nBefore the end of term, if you are\ninterested in an R SMU post please see\nthe present holder of that post or Bernie\nPryor. Expressing an interest by no\nmeans obligates you to stand for anything.\nSee you tonight\nBob the Slob\nRCS\nWell January's events have\ncome and gone and what a month of indifference. With the\nelection machinery tru ndel ling towards the Hustings U GM on\nThursday28 th February it's time to decide whether or not\nyou are prepared to inject your\nenthusiasm into the Royal College of Science Union. Remember each post is what\nyou make it so if you think we\ngot it all wrong this year, stand\nup and try to sort it out for\n1980-81.\nTuesday's Night Out to the\ntheatre on student stand-by s was a moderately rip-roaring\nsuccess. Without burning holes\nin anyone's pockets we could\nhave had forty stand-by seats\nfor either Middle Age Spread\nor The Last Of The Red Hot\nLovers. However, a quick show\nof hands in the Cockney Pride\nrevealed that there were only\nseventeen of us, and most wanted to see Richard Briers\nand Paul Eddington in Middle\nAge Spread. So the intrepid\nseventeen rushed hot foot to\nthe Lyric Theatre pausing only\nto order drinks for the half-time\ninterval and settled down for\nan evening of cheap, civilised\nentertainment marred only by a lack of support from the rest of\nthe union.\nLooking back to the Soccer\nSixes, since there was no RCS article last week, another enjoyable afternoon's entertainment was sav our ed by only a handful of hardy amateurs, mot\nof whom couldn't tell one end\nof the football from the other.\nDespite an intriguing league\nsystem, dependent on the single-transferable goal and/or\nplea bargaining most teams rapidly discovered that a modicum of skill was necessary\nto win a jug of beer. Not so\nR CSU and ICU. In an act of\nun parallelled corruption a peculiar arrangement was made between the teams of the\ntwo presidents. By allowing each\nother to score goals they hoped\nto transgress their own league\nand move onto the Super Bowl.\nHowever, despite letting each\nothers feeble shots in they still\ncould not get the required number of goals, corners, four-leafed clovers and rabbits' feet to\ngo through to the final.\nIn a three-way play-off for first\nplace the ICP As won with the\nBio che mPG s second and Chem2 third. The absence of any team\nfrom Physics, the largest department in College makes me\nwonder if there is an exit from the\nBlackett Lab or if Cyrogenics are\nhaving another go at suspended\nanimation.\nOn to the subject of rag. Monopoly, usually a huge event\nmanaged to attract a mere nineteen people who exhorted\nabout \u00a3200 from the public. A free bus-rover went to everyone\nwho collected more than \u00a31.25\nand so you all missed a chance to\nsee London for nothing and help\nanother deaf child hear the word indifference through a brand new\nradio hearing-aid.\nFinally dates of forthcoming\nevents:\nRugby Sevens: This Sunday,\n10th February. If you can get the\nname of your team to Ray\nMyers, Chem2 by midday you\ncould still be playing.\nValentines Disco: Friday 15th February in J CR. Buy your\ntickets in advance or else, like\nthe Halloween Party, you won't get in.\nValentines Rag: Saturday 16th February 9:30is hR CSU. Cupid s and Worlds Greatest LoversS edu cer s or Gangsters( St\nValentines Day Massacre). Anyway, as a footnote, if you\nwant to stand for any Union post\nnext year drop into the Union\nOffice anytime for a cup of coffee\nand a chat to find out what it's all\nabout.\n2\n\n"

    "content": "U GM REPORT\nPresident's Business\nThe petition to Ted Heath against\noverseas students' fees increases had so\nfar gathered 1,500 signatures (including\napproximately 170 from the staff), but no\nreply had been received to the request for\nan appointment. The crib sheet on ' How to Lobby Your MP' is available for those\nwho would like to do so. The BBC 'News\nQuiz' programme was recorded and broadcast, and another visit will be taking\nplace on Thursday 21st February though,\nsince most of the tickets were handed out\nat the last quiz, there are only a few\ntickets left.\nThe accommodation photo competition\nis now open for entries.\nDeputy President\nFire extinguishers for people's flats are\non sale in the Union Office for between\n\u00a313 and \u00a317 and fire blankets may be\nordered.\nWork has now started on the Union Bar Hoist.\nHonorary Secretary\nJohn Anderson, Tansy He pt on, Andy C hey ne and Gary Nichols have been\nchosen at random from the Council to sit\non the Elections Committee. Election rules and job des rip t ions for those thinking of standing for a post can be\nobtained from the Union Office.\nTwenty pounds has been allocated to\nbuy a new Union banner.\nBy-Law Changes\n1. I CW A( proposed by Jo Armitage)\nIt took thirty minutes of discussion and\nspeeches to eventually pass the first\nreading of the proposed change, which, if\npassed at the second reading, will delete\nthe I CW A constitution from the Blue\nJ3ook, change the I CW A Lounge into the\nUpper Lounge and remove the \"President\nof the Women's Association\" from Council. John Whitehouse moved a procedural\nmotion that the question be moved to a later meeting, when the results of the\nI CW A questionnaire had been published,\nbut this was turned down by the Chairman. The amendment, proposed by Malcolm Brain, to remove the right of I CW A to\nhave a specific room( the I CW A Lounge)\nbut delete the rest of the by-law change\nwas narrowly defeated by 106 to 96.\n2. Establishment Of Internal Service Committee( proposed by Chris Fox)\nThe first reading was passed without\nopposition, so that the Service Committee\nand the Haldane Library Committee may be\nreplaced by the Internal Services Committee. The Deputy President would\nbecome the chairman of this committee.\n3. To Put Academic Standing Clause Into\nBy-laws (proposed by RJ Stotesbury)\nThe second reading was passed without\nopposition. This will now specifically prevent a repetition of the John Shuttleworth case.\nMotions\n1. Finniston Report (proposed by Rick\nWaldenberg, seconded by Mark Brown)\nThis motion noted the recommendations\nof the committee of inquiry into the\nengineering profession which are that:\na. Engineering courses should become\nmore biased towards futures in management.\nb. The status of engineers should be\nincreased.\nc. The engineering student should receive an extra \u00a3250 in recognition of\ntheir importance in industry.\nIt advised that, since Imperial College\nstudents would be greatly effected by this\nreport, students should read a synopsis (the\nactual report is over 200 pages long) and\nplay a role in the development of a response\nto the report.\nBernard Smith's proposed amendment to\nthe motion, which would add to ICU Believes that \"Engineering students should\nnot be considered in isolation from the rest\nof the student body\" and \" That non-engineering students are as important to\nIndustry as engineering students,\" was\nunfortunately misinterpreted; both by\nBernie and those present at the U GM. The\ndebate on Bernie' s amendment thus became more of a question as to whether\nengineers should receive an extra \u00a3250, and\nalmost developed into a Guilds vs The Rest\ndebate.\nThe procedural motion that the question\nbe not heard was passed by a majority vote\nand thus the amendment was defeated.\nWhen Bernie tried to oppose the main\nmotion with exactly the same speech he\nused for the amendment the procedural\nmotion that the speaker be not heard was\nmoved, and again passed by a majority\nvote.\nThe motion was eventually passed, though voting appeared to be close.\nChris Fox also announced that Sir Monty Finniston will be visiting the College on\nMonday3 rd March, and hence members of\nGuilds and Mines have had all lectures after\n3:30pm cancelled for that day.\nA procedural motion to adjourn the\nmeeting so that the Anti Corrie Bill lobby\nmarch could be joined by members of the\nmeeting was not accepted.\n2. Megalomania (proposed by P Merry man, seconded by S Teelock)\nThis was, according to Mr Merry man, obviously a joke motion, and in his speech\nhe put forward that the letters written to the\nSoviet Embassy and Mrs Thatcher would\nhave no effect on their policies and, as such,\nthe motions passed recently on those\nsubjects, and the motions on South Africa\nand Cambodia were futile and a waste of\nUnion time.\nThe amendment which proposed to\ndelete ICU instructs, was defeated and\nthe main motion was passed, in spite of\nChris Fox' s statement that the Exec knew that their letters had little effect, but\nthat every bit of opposition, however\nsmall, helps.\nThis will mean that the E AO will now\nhave to apply to the UN, on behalf of\nICU for a seat on the UNC. The meeting was adjourned at 2:20pm. Mary Freeman\n(News Editor)\nLORD ANNAN AT THE\nBOARD OF STUDIES\nMEETING\n\" So this is the Right Honourable Lord Annan, the Vice Chancellor of the\nUniversity of London,\" I thought as he\nspoke to the Board of Studies meeting\nlast Wednesday. This is the top bod in\nLondon University, one of the most important people in higher education in\nthis country. One expects to be impressed\nby people of this stature. I was not\nimpressed at all. Far from it, the man doesn't know what he's talking about; and that's not my opinion, that's fact.\n\" The students' union of this college,\nlike all other colleges, is financed directly\nby local education authorities,\" he said.\nWrong. We are one of few student's unions in the country which receives its\ngrant as a sub vent ion from the college\nand hence our funds come from the block\ngrant given by the University Grants Commission to IC. Of the areas where economies could be\nmade in order to cope with the Govern ment cuts, one of his principle suggestions\nwas that students should play sports on\nSundays as well as Saturdays and Wednesdays so that the number of sports\ngrounds could be reduced. I'm sure that\nwill go an enormous way towards saving\nthe many millions of pounds that need to\nbe saved. Mind you, Senate House are\ndoing their bit: a couple of staff have left\nand they haven't been replaced he told us\nemphatically.\nHow about closing one of the smaller\nLondon colleges, somebody asked.( Which, realistically, is one of the few\nways that really substantial savings could\nbe made, eventhough it may be\nundesirable.) He didn't sound too keen: it\nmay be considered by a committee he's setting up to look into it.\nExam costs are coming under attack\nalot these days, and quite rightly as\nadmins t ration of exam costs London University nearly two million pounds a year. Lord Annan believes in exams though, he told us: \" A three hour exam is\na good test of character . . . puts the\nstudent under pressure; after all, we're all\nunder pressure.\" I must admit I found it\ndifficult not to laugh in the face of this\nBritish Colonial Army Stiff Upper Lip stuff.\nWhat about the University trying to\nraise some money? Well, he's definitely\ndoing his bit to help there. Oh yes, he's inviting some top industrialists to the\nanniversary dinner of the Que et LMu m being chancellor. And by 'rational is ation' does he mean cuts? shrinkage? . . . well,\nwe didn't actually get an answer on that\none.\nI 'll say one thing for Lord Annan, he\ndoes fully appreciate the folly of the\npresent government's attitude towards\nhigher education. He, like anybody else\nwho has given the matter any thought,\nrealises that the government calculations\nof ' full economic cost' for overseas students aren't based on common sense.\nSo that was the Lord Annan we've all\nheard about. As I say, I'm not impressed.\nGary Nichols\n12\n\n"

    "content": "SINGLE ROOMS FOR \u00a33.50 A WEEK\nAs many IC students will know from\npersonal experience, it is very difficult to\nfind a place to rent, at a reasonable price,\nin London. The problem is so great that\nlocal councils often have to house homeless families in hotels or bed and\nbreakfast places. So it is rather surprising\nthat there are tens of thousands of empty\nproperties, often council owned, dotted\naround London. Many of the houses are\nawaiting red evo lp ment \u2014 which may take\nyears \u2014 some have simply been 'lost' by\nthe bureaucracies involved, others are\nsomewhat derelict, and so on. The aim of\nthe Backdoor Housing Cooperative formed at IC last year, is to make use of\nthese 'short-life' houses for its members.\nEmpty houses are easy to spot \u2014\nespecially if they are boarded up! Once found, chances of success are best if the\nproperty is council owned. The hard part\nis to persuade owners that participating is\nto their advantage. Typically a group of\nmembers from the cooperative might take\nover a house and live in it for six months\nto several years at a tent of \u00a33.50 per\nweek. The owner benefits because an\noccupied house deteriorates more slowly\nthan an empty one. If the owner is the\nlocal council then an additional 'perk' is\nthe rates revenue, paid by the cooperative\nout of the rent received. A further advantage to the owner is that the group\nundertakes reasonable repairs to the\nhouse. Most importantly, homeless people\nare housed at low rents.\nOne such house is being run by the\ngroup in Mortlake( SW14). An unfurnished\nhouse of four bedrooms, lounge, kitchen,\nbathroom and two gardens was occupied by\nfour students at the cooperative's rent of\n\u00a33.50 each per week. Sound interesting?\nFurniture and equipment has been bought\nsecond-hand, or scrounged, and despite\nsome early problems (like flooding the\nneighbouring house!) the place is now very\ncomfortable, the licence will probably last\nfor six months and maybe longer. Houses\nwhich needed lots of-work would only be\nused if they were available for longer and\nstructural repairs would be paid for by the\ncooperative \u2014 this is why a rent is collected.\nIf you like a Bohemian life, surrounded by\npaint pots, fuse boxes and copies of\nAlternative London; or if you are cooperatively minded and would help run a group to try and house people (including\nyourself), come to the next meeting on\nThursday 14th February at 12:45pm in the\nS CR( first floor, Union Building) and help\ndecide about:\n1.

    "content": "MOTORCYCLE CLUB\nLast term was one of the most\nsuccessful periods in the club's short\nhistory since it was formed four years\nago.\nIn October the Club received an\ninvitation to take part in a competition\norganised by the Barking Road Safety\nOfficer to find the 'Safe Rider Of The\nYear 1979'. The event attracted riders\nfrom all over London and consisted of\na number of low speed tests, designed\nto test the riders' balance and control\nof their bikes, followed by a Highway\nCode test. There was great surprise\namongst the Club members when\nChris Rees, the Club's Captain, someone not noted for his safe riding,\nwas declared the winner. Dave Edgley,\nClub treasurer managed a runner-up\nslot, on his \"amazing\" Honda CX500\n(known as a plastic maggot due to its\nshape and material construction). Other IC entrants included Nick Tames on his incredibly ancient Velocette 350 viper, which proved difficult to handle around the staggered\nbol lards and he rode into an adjacent\nbrick wall.\nThe next competitive event of the term\ncame when four of the Club members\nwere invited to attend the Star Pupil Day\nrun by the Motorcycle School at Brands\nHatch. These members being Bill Nash,\nSteve Warin, Chris Rees and Julian\nHarris. This annual competition is run\nfor the best thirty-five pupils from\napproximately 2,500 who attend the\nschool in any one year, and requires\nentrants to complete ten laps on the\nschool's bikes whilst being judged on.\nlines, braking, gear changing, smooth-ness, etc. Track conditions on the day\nwere far from ideal, having rained in\nthe morning the fraction was at\nminimum. Steve and Bill were the first\nof our members to ride and came back\ncomplaining of terrible front and back\nwheel slides (not recommended on\ntwo wheels). Julian and Chris were in\nthe last group out and produced some\nreasonable lap times with Julian eventually putting in a one minute six\nseconds (very quick in the wet and\nfastest of the day). After processing\nthe results it was announced that\nJulian had finished second, winning\nfifty pounds and a silver trophy while\nChris was fifth collecting twenty pounds.\nA number of members compete in\nmotorcycle road racing at Club level\nincluding Nick Jameson another incredibly ancient Velocette (against\nPukka racing Yamahas? what a man)\nand a few others are starting this year.\nThe Club now has strong links with\nthe motorcycle racing school at\nBrands Hatch and will be helping to\nrun in the schools new batch of\nHonda 400 twins. We also anticipate\nanother trip to the school later this\nterm for tuition, so that all budding\nBarry sheen es can play at being boy\nracers.\nThe Club meets every Wednesday at\n1:00pm above Stan's, and always welcomes new members, possession\nof a motorcycle is not necessary.\n1\nf[1f: \u2022\n;\nr SAILING CLUB\nIC vs Cambridge University\nHaving beaten Oxford on their home\nwater last week, IC sailing team travelled to Cambridge on Sunday to\ntake on that university's team.\nConditions were light and variable,\nmainly due to the lake (a duck pond,\nactually, I think) being surrounded by\ntrees, but IC took commanding first,\nsecond and sixth positions at the start\nof the first race. However, having\ntaken two lots of penalty points, the\nteam needed to improve on the sixth\nrace, and so by the finish the positions\nwere first, second and third. Unfortunately, Colin Murray collided with\nteam-mate Ian Robson on the finish\nline, resulting in more penalty points,\nbut the positions were good enough\nfor IC to win the race.\nIn the second race, IC were again\nfirst, second, and sixth by the first\nmark, with team captain John Williams\nholding a good lead. Nick Ajderian,\ntaking a turn on the helm, and lying\nsecond, was put under some pressure\nby the Cambridge boats, but held out\nso that IC finished first, second, and\nsixth, winning the race and the match.\nWith home matches against Oxford\nand Cambridge to come, IC's position\nin the league looks very strong.\nTeam:John Williams (capt), Gill\nButler, Ian Robson, Kevin Andrews,\nColin Murray and Nick Ajderian.\nEDITED . . . IC BILLIARDS\nAND SNOOKER CLUB REPORT\nOn Wednesday occurred the biggest\nevent since the hour before. The' A' team\nplayed the ' C team or visa versa. In one\nof the most dramatically unmemorable\nsequences in Transylvanian history, the\n'C team were annihilated like a Benn Callaghan interaction with the ' A' team\nplaying with the authority of a Peter Purves darts commentary, the ' C team,\neven though high on 'scar' music were\ndefenseless (cor, Madness!). This first\nencounter of the depraved kind, was between' Chalky' White and David Crassland. Dave put up a performance\nreminiscent of a pregnant jabberwocky\nand was lucky not to get his unbeaten\nrecord squashed into afl acid pulpy sludge\nby the ' C team's electrifying (at 'cast\ntelling from the hairstyle) White. However, Dave won. Next on was me\nand I lost to Martin Proudlove. Sorry to\nlet you down, Ray Reardon, Next on was M ssr sTeel ock and Nuttall. Mr Nuttall, recognised for his\nability to act like the spastic who won the\nWorld Disco Dancing Championships, put\nup an erotic performance, but lost, may ble owing to the fact that his hands\nnever left his Hungarian magic cube except to change his nose bag. Teelock\nwas as stupidly, gorm less ly happy as\nusual (who wouldn't be with a harem like\nhis?) and congratulated Mr Nuttall afterwords for losing.\nLast on was \u2014 a day late \u2014 Damian Kelly who was rescued last week by some\nsurreptitious mis editing by Mr Palmer\n(not Arnold) who played Geoff Keymer. Geoff won Last but one on was the match between G Curtis and Crass Tripp, which\nwas billed as a flyweight contest with one\nball or a submission deciding the winner. I did hear cries of \"I submit\" from Curtis\nbut I think it was the ball which won it for\nMr Tripp, giving the ' A' team a five-nil\nwin.\nThe' B' team played LSE at home later in\nthe day. The' B' team's reservists were led\nby Mr A Leclezio. Second on was Steve\n' Frank Spencer' Jeans.\nThird was andy' Poles last in War' K re sew ski who sporting' Moscow Olympics' stickers played a true com mi amateur-cum-professional to earn a win\nand two free tickets to try to esc cape from Alcatraz like Clint Eastwood really\ndid in real life. Fourth on was CMS, I mean CC, Chris Calvert who was wearing matching leg shackles and rucksack. In this informal atmosphere,\nnot even a John Travolta movie could\nstop CC from losing (although Urban\nCowboy came a close second to Moment\nBy Moment in the JT popularity stakes).\nLast on was Phil Peters, a true Irish\nimmigrant smuggled inside a ten pound bomb in 1975. His explosive action, \u00abwith\nas much style as a Bob Geldoff haircut or\na Jess Yates sermon, won him the day to\ngive the ' B' team a four-one win.\nGareth Mach in15 "

    "content": "Dear Colin At the time of writing I do\nnot know the result of your\nmotion on the Olympic Games,\nbut I would like to make some\ncomments. Your motion is\nerroneous in many aspects:\n1. Athletes from all countries\nhave not been training for the\n1980 Olympics, as there will be\nno South African or Rhodesian\nathletes present.\n2. If ICU believes that sport\nshould never be used as a weapon or for political pur-poses. This is a sentiment that I agree with, then do you and\nICU approve of the Gleneagles\nAgreement? Is it not hypocritical\nto propose and support this\nmotion if you do support the\nGlen eagles Agreement which calls for a boycott on sport with\nSouth Africa?\n3. To me the ideals of the\nOlympic Games are dead. This is because they are no longer\napolitical and have not been so\nfor a long time. They are used\nas a political weapon. Do you\nremember the Montreal Olympic Games and New Zealand? They are no longer amateur events as\nfar as Russian athletes are\nconcerned although they are not\nquite professional.\n4. It is hypocritical to condemn\na call to boycott while calling\nfor a boycott of sport with another country for political reasons.\nYours sincerely\nLawrence Stucke.\nDear Sir\nIt appears that only about\nfive percent of the questionnaire\nsheets were returned. I would\nsuggest to you that the thing is\nuseless. I think most students\nhere have at least a superficial\nunderstanding of random sampling in statistics. The questionnaire has only produced\ndata from students who are\ninterested in returning it (5%). In\nno way can this be a truly\nrandom sample of IC students. I expect someone from the maths\ndepartment might assist you in\nrunning a more sensible ques-tion n aire. Yours sincerely\nBarney McCabe Physics 2\nDear Sir\nI was dismayed to see the\nfirst reading of the motion proposing the total abolition of\nthe Imperial College Women's Association passed by such a large majority and with such\nlittle discussion at the last\nUnion meeting. The proponents\nof the motion produced very\nverbose and sardonic arguments. They also levelled, I feel,\nsome unjustified criticisms at the\nassociation. Many important issues in the debate seem to have\nbecome clouded, or overlooked\ncompletely, and although the\nproblem is not an easy one it\nappears to comprise of three\nbasic areas of discontent. Namely the existence of the\nI CW A Lounge, the finance that\nI CW A receives from the union\nand the representation that it has\non various Union committees\nand on council.\nThe objection to the presence\nof the I CW A Lounge seems to\nme to be singularly ludicrous as it\nserves many other functions\nother than that of being a women's lounge. Not least of\nthese functions is its use as a crash pad at the beginning of the\nyear. The room is also used for\nmeetings, rehearsals and many\nother purposes. I see no reason\nwhy any group with a reasonable\nclaim cannot use it at any time\nthey require it. However, for\nthose parts of the day when it is\nnot being used why is it wrong to\ndedicate it to use by women? I cannot ever recall having heard\nof a case of women barricading\nthemselves in the I CW A Lounge\nand refusing to allow anyone else\nto use it. When one considers\nthat almost every other area in\nCollege is populated primarily by\nmen, simply by virtue of the high\npercentage of men studying at\nIC, is it unreasonable to allocate\na small area as a place where\nwomen can go and feel fairly\nconfident of finding less men\nthan women?\nThe financial aspect of the\nproblem also seems to be\nsomething of a red herring dangled around to mislead us all.\nI CW A, like any other group in\nthe Union, receives its finance\nfrom UFC. If the Union believes\nthat it receives money in disproportion to its requirements then it is up to UFC to\nmake the necessary reduction in\nits grant. To state that I CW A squanders too much money, and\nconsequently should be abolished to prevent this, is like try ng to crack a nut with a steam roller.\nAllocating Union money to minority groups is not some form\nof grave sin as all Union grants, in\neffect, go to minority interests. I would challenge anyone to show\nme just one piece of Union\nexpenditure that has benefitted\nevery member of the Union. As an aside, I personally would\nrather see X pounds spent on\nI CW A than X pounds spent by\nCC UV Ps on drinks in the bar for\nrag collectors.\nArguably, representation is\nthe most important function of\nI CW A. Representation of\nwomen both within the Union\nand to the College authorities.\nThe I CW A President is not alone\non Council in having the specific\ntask of voicing the views of a particular portion of the Union membership. The OS C Chairman, PG Affairs Officer and\nSilwood Park Representative all\nhave identical functions. The\nICCA G Chairman even sits on\nCouncil to inform us of the action\nof IC in the \"community at\nlarge\". I would find it strange if,\nsay, the ICCA G Chairman remained on Council to represent the interests of the community whilst the I CW A President, who represents the\nviews of women in College, was\nremoved. Many people are perfectly capable of representing\nthemselves. They have voices\nloud enough to be heard. Many more voices that are not heard\nand need representation by\nsome person or body more able.\nThey should be deprived of this\nright. Further, to state the I CW A President is unrepresentative\nand out of contact with the\nmembership and that the I CW A Committee practises some false\nform of democracy is fallacious.\nIt is no more or less democratic\nthan most other Union comit-tees. If we are going to level the\nfinger at areas of the union\nstructure that are undemocratic\nand not as representative as they\nmight be I can think of many\nplaces to point it before I CW A. To support the motion for the\nabolition of I CW A is to selfishly\nsteal away the I CW A Lounge for\nsome dubious future purpose,\nwhich nobody seems to have\nthought much about. It is to put a stop to all the social events that\nI CW A organises and prevent\nwomen having a corporate representative position in the\nUnion and in College. To abolish\nI CW A is to sweep away an\nestablished, traditional and dignified organisation. It is an\ninsult to the women studying at\nIC and to those women destined\nto come here in the future to\nI hope that this will not happen.\nTony Cox Physics 3\nDear Colin\nTime has come to defend\nstudent grants! At the last\nU GM there was great confusion\nabout the motion on student\ngrants. The motion called for\nnational discussion on the level\nof grants not calling for an increase. At present we are\nopposing cuts in the increases of\neducational expenditure, we are\nnot yet fighting cuts in educational expenditure. To freeze\ngrant levels will effectively devalue student grants by 20% (a rough estimate for inflation over\nthe next year). Jo has obviously\nnever lived in non College residence, as otherwise she\nwould understand that many\nstudents cannot live on their\ngrants. It should be remembered\nthat many students do not\nreceive sponsorship and that\nmany students live in private\naccommodation viz, flats, beds its and lodgings.\nWhilst in an ideal society we\nwould campaign for the total\nabolition of the means test, it\nshould be noted that we can\nhope to win this campaign immediately but that the means\ntest must be phased out gradually. Unitl that is accomplished we must continue to fight\nfor increases in student grants so\nthat the grant will not become\ndevalued and economically meaningless. The student grant\nshould allow students to study at\nuniversity and we should actively\ncampaign to ensure this.\nYours sincerely\nBernard Smith\nDear Sir\nSurely anyone would agree\nthat it is irresponsible to deliberately refuse to see the\nfacts before making important\ndecisions, but that is exactly\nwhat happened at last Tuesday'sU GM when my procedural motion to postpone the I CW A debate was defeated.\nWhat I was trying to say was\nthat to make such a decision\non whether or not I CW A was\nirrelevant, we should first see\nthe results of the recent questionnaire rather than rely\npurely on the partisan presentation of the speakers. This\nopinion I feel was borne out\nwhen speakers from both sides\nused the so far unpublished\nresults of the questionnaire to\nsupport their side.\nI realise everyone's minds\nhad been made up before the\nmeeting, but one has to at least\npay lip service to democracy.\nJohn Whitehouse\nChe mPG Dear Colin Iam perturbed by the continuous editing given to my\nsnooker article. I think most people like a bit of humour\nYours wonder ou sly Gareth Mach in Physics 2\n4\n\n"

The\nNUS march from UL U to Westminster was attended by about\n4,000 students and also supported\nby some nurses and other unions.\nBy the time we reached Westminster\nthere were already thousands of\npeople at the NAC rally in Central\nHall and in the lobby queues. At\nthe rally, among others, David Steel, Liberal MP, spoke out in\nfavour of the act he authored (the\n1967 act). He stressed that however\nmuch we try to improve society,\nwomen will always need abortions,\nand it is right that this should be\ncatered for.

He was convicted of a political\noffence shortly after the declaration\nof UDI in 1965. Seven years later,\nshortly after the completion of his\nsentence, he was detained without\ntrial under an Emergency Powers\nAct. He is now 'free' but restricted to\na particular region of Zimbabwe. He\nhas been unable to find a job; partly\nbecause this is always difficult for ex-political prisoners and partly because\nw hilt he was in jail he developed an\ninjury to his foot.

This is done by negotiating with\nCollege each year based on estimates from\nthe past year. Most other SUs however,\nare funded on a per capita system from\nLEAs and are thus totally autonomous\nfrom their colleges. However, the LEAs cannot negotiate with the unions concerning\nthe per capita required. These unions negotiate with their colleges to decide a fair payment which the LEAs must then\npay.\nBoth these systems have anomalies, in\nour case we compete with academic departments for our money, an issue which\nwill feature more and more in years to\ncome as college fin an aces are restricted\nand must only result in a decrease in' our Union facilities. In the autonomy case it is\npossible to make ultra vire s payments, eg\nin the past one college made payments to\nthe IRA.( We have policy against ultra\nvire s payments!) Also colleges can agree\nwith unions to increase the per capita by\nlarge amounts if unions allow some of the\nmoney to go to the colleges.\nThe whole system of SU funding has\nbeen under discussion for some time now\nand three proposals have been made:\n1. Flat-rate fee (\u00a315-20) from LEAs and a set amount from colleges.\n2. Voluntary membership and amount\nfrom colleges.\n3. Block amount to UGC( j \u00a315m) distributed\nto colleges and college/union negotiations.\nThe problems with each of these is that\nagain unions are competing with academic\ndepartments for money. The alternative to\nthis is that the UGC earmarks some of the\ncollege grant for unions, but this would\nrequire Statutory Instruments to be\npassed in Parliament and some MPs have\nsaid that they would not be passed.\nThe problem with autonomous unions is\nthat there is no public accountability and\naS U may misuse the money allocated to it\nas above, but the legal restrictions on the\nuse of this money have increased \u2014 ultra\nvire s payments (payments to bodies outside\none's own responsibility eg to other unions)\nare illegal. Also the LEAs must make\npayments in which they have no negotiating\npower.\nHowever the per capita system in the\npresent economic climate must be\npreferential to that in which unions must\ncompete with academic departments finance.\nNB ICU spends approximately .3% (''/,\u201e\u201e\u201e)\nof its total income on External Allairs.\nJohn Passmore External Affairs Officer14 "

Thus came into being the shady world\nof Graffitti. Wandering, homeless and\ndestitute, these persecuted individuals\nwere banished to the haunted West\nWing of the Union Buiiding.

The purpose of the society is to provide an\noutlet for anyone's artistic ability. The\nfacilities are open for any graphic arts\n(drawing, illustrating, lettering, etc).\nOver the years, the interest in\nscreen printing developed; as a means\nof producing volumes of publicity or\nas an end in itself. (Incidentally, about\n20% of modern printing is by this\nmethod.) The accumulation of a home-made light table, a photos oc cast-off enlarger, drying racks and a vertical screen washing trough fol-lowed; together with the largest\ncollection of inks and papers (just)\nEast of the Royal College of Art.\nWhat you may ask, is screen printing? Imagine a method of squeezing ink through a stretched mesh\nscreen. Partially block out the screen,\nas in the diagram, so that only letters\nor designs are left clear for ink to pass\nthrough, and that's screen printing.\nThe blocking out is mainly by a photographic process, transferring any\ndesign on transparent film, or translucent drafting film.\nThe ink passes through on to whatever you put underneath; poster\npaper, tee-shirts, badge size paper, tin\ncans, plastics, or the table! The chief\nadvantage is that any surface can be\n6 f cOCK printed on with the range of profess ional equipment available.

Societies\nare free to commission posters up to\nSRA2 size (on extended A2). What is\nreally needed is people willing to take\nup commissions. A little technique can\ncover for a lot of detailed artistic\nability. Imagination is the only limit to\nthe possibilities. Any potential Andy\nWarhols out there?

    "content": "IC 5th s vs RSM 2nds:32 Birkbcck 1st vs IC 5th s:12 With two thrilling and entertaining matches on Wednesday and Saturday\nwhich both produced nail-biting finishes; the fifths collected yet another four\npoints to improve their chances of a late bid for the title.\nWednesday's match against RS M2 was a superbly refereed, well balanced\ngame with either side looking capable of snatching the points until 'Big' Dave\nDean, covering a lot of ground to run onto a Damian Kelly pass, placed an\nunstoppable shot out of the reach of the Mines' keeper. Earlier in the match\nthe fifths had taken the lead when Nick Matthews was sent clear by Russ\nGilbert and made no mistake with his shot. And it was Nick Matthews who laid\non the second goal for John Healy after Mines had equalise d his earlier effort.\nWith Mines equal ising just before half-time to set up a thrilling second half it\nwas no surprise that even after the fifths winning goal Mines continued to apply\npressure on the IC defence to get another equalise r. Great credit must go to\ndefenders, Pat Chown, Phil Lakin, Nick David and Bill Caffyn for withstanding\nthis pressure with great skill and composure. And a special mention must be\nmade the fifths goalkeeper Duncan Brown who produced four 'world class'\nsaves to deprive the opposition at vital moments.\nOn Saturday the fifths faced yet another daunting prospect against a Birbeck side who had won their last ten games. One of the main problems was\nfound to be transporting players to the ground. With Mark Clegg the fifths\ncaptain, and tactical genius, unfortunately absent with flu, the fifths were\ndeprived of an extra car which would have proved invaluable. Paul Gohil's late\narrival, with car, eased the situation, but Dave Brannan, Steve Simms (one m), Pat Chown and Dave Griffiths were still forced to sample the delights of\nLondon transport.\nHowever, when the match did finally kick-off the fifths proved that they had\nnot been disheartened by these events or Quentin Merrit's navigating, and in a goalless first half the fifths were unlucky not to score on several occasions,\nparticularly Quentin Merrit who after a fine run through the Birbeck defence\nwas robbed of a certain goal when he was cynically uprooted by a Birbeck\ndefender whose crime went completely unpunished by an otherwise excellent\nreferee.\nIn the second half Dave McPhail started to show his true class and was\nconsistently causing the Birbeck defence trouble, even before, he sent a rasping thirty yard shot into the roof of the Birbeck net. And it was he who\nmade the second goal for Nick Matthews shortly after, following some fine\nwork between Steve Sims and Dave Brannan (playing his first full game of the\nseason). With Birbeck getting a goal back from a fairly harsh penalty decision,\nit was left, to what has now become a very solid fifth team defence, to hold out\nfor what seemed a very lengthy last ten minutes. It came as no surprise when\nPaul Gohil, Pat Chown, or Dave Griffiths, and Nick David did this with\ncons u mate ease. Once again Duncan Brown was also on hand to make several\nvital, breathtaking saves in the dying minutes. A special mention to Russ\nGilbert who when Duncan was beaten once from a corner was 'on hand' to\nmake a very handy score.\nThe continuing saga of the famous\nladies rugby team Last Friday the Imperial College Ladies Rugby team were featured\non the London and S.E. section of NATIONWIDE. The film featured\nthe IC vs UC match at Harlington which ended in a00 draw. The cameras focused on all aspects of the game including the boat race in\nthe bar afterwards. The film was spliced with interviews with both\ncaptains and Eddie. Everyone in the team who saw it said that they\nenjoyed it. It was a pity that the BBC couldn't let us know the\nscreening date! The team have also hit the press (again!) notably the\nEvening News' centre pages. The article was rather tongue in cheek\nand featured a picture of a scrum. The continuing interest in Ladies\nRugby has also been noted by the BBC World Service.\nCaroline holds on\nIC 1st XI vs London Hospital 1st XI\nTheir winning ways having suffered a setback in their last game IC firsts\ntook the field against London Hospital 1st XI in the mood to put things\nright and settle a few scores^f earlier in the season. The IC team settled\nwell and took a stranglehold on the midfield which was to be crucial, Andy\nHaralampous in particular was forceful and full of running, one of his\ncross field passes found Ian Stevenson too busy admiring it to do anything\nwith it, about the only thing Ian did wrong all afternoon. The considerable\ncontrol IC were able to assert was by virtue of good team play from the\nback all the way through to the forwards. Half time arrived with feeling\nthat it was only a matter of time before IC scored. The wait for the first\ngoal was not a long one. James Roley intercepted the first pass from the\nkick off and j inked his way unchallenged through the entire London team\nto beat the goalkeeper with a shot which rebounded off a post. The only\ndoubt was whether the ball had crossed the line, but the Captain's persuasive powers worked on the referee again and the goal stood.\nFortified by this deserved success, IC again dominated. The forwards looking\nparticularly threatening with Graham Rickard prompting the ever-running\nDave Dean and James Roley. It was however Chris Hendy who scored\nthe second goal. He seemed slightly surprised that the ball reached him at\nthe far post through a crowd of three London players. Rising to the\noccasion he thrust the top half of his person at the ball and managed to\nthrust it towards the open goal. IC appeared to consider that two goals\nwere enough and eased up slightly, which provided Steve Veats with more\nwork, he made one fine save tipping the ball round the post whilst\nhorizontal, thank heavens he didn't have to catch it!\nTwo-nil was perhaps generous to London who had experienced one of\nIC's best performances so far this season.\nTeam: S Veats, J Gamble, M Curran, M Kenrick, K Reeve, C Hendy, A Haralampous, I Stevenson, J Roley, D Dean and G Rickard.\nIC 2nd XI vs Barnes HCW: 2-1\nWe expect you're all wondering why the IC hockey 2nd XI never gets a mention in this illustrious publication. Well, we think that it stems from a vicious rumour that maintains that we never win! This remarkable state of\naffairs was put right on Saturday when a Barnes team of average age 34V2 was well and truly hammered into the ground by the ruthless tactics and\neffective hockey that so typifies the play of the seconds. (Actually, we\nmanaged to scrape through 2-1!).\nWe overcame the first hurdle with some ease by persuading the 1st XI\nto take captain Gordon Baxter off our hands. From this point on, the\nteam could do not wrong. Arriving at the ground forty-five minutes before\nthe opposition, Dave Cornwell managed to get an excellent snapshot of\none member of the side relieving himself of the pre-match tension!\nOnce on the pitch we proceeded to con Barnes into thinking that we\nwere the 3rd XI. They were so taken in by this that Gordon wy lie was\nable to carve through their defence and score from an a row angle. A second goal soon followed, as a defender helpfully kicked Mike Chew's shot inside the post. In the second half, the team never quite recovered\nfrom being 2-0 up and allowed Barnes to score late on. However, thanks\nto good defensive work and Martin Shaw's umpiring, we hung on to\nrecord an historic victory.\nThanks must also be expressed to keeper Martin 'Banks' Cooper for\nonly touching the ball twice \u2014 once to pick it out of the net!; to Steve\nRampton for effectively body-checking their right-wing whenever he could;\nand to Gordon Wylie for not getting a green card this week!\nAndy Stoomer and Simon Gray\nFalmouth beat Keogh\nFalmouth Hall beat Keogh in the football match held this morning in\nHyde Park. Two spectators watched the match, equalling the crowd\nattendance record, but they left when Falmouth were leading by five goals\nto nil. There was no violence, except for a couple of minor fouls, which\nresulted in a very clean game; however, in another sense, the game was\nextremely muddy, in fact the ball virtually refused to bounce and stuck in\nthe mud quite a lot. One player described the game as being more like\nwater polo, and Harry Jingh wore goggles for part of the match.\nMick McNicholas was the major scorer for Falmouth with three of the\nsix goals; Huddersfield scored one of the two Keogh goals, the second of\nwhich went in while the Falmouth goalkeeper, Charles Rich, was leaning\nagainst his goalpost in the closing seconds of the match, waiting for the\nfinal whistle.\nHaving beaten Keogh 6-2, Falmouth's next game is in a week's time\nagainst Linstead who beat Willis Jackson House 4-2 last Sunday.\n\n"
