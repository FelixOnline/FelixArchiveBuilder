This FRESH\nBLOOD Service is complementary to the\nNational Blood Transfusion Service and cooperates with the Department of Health in the\nNational Health Service. Our Donors are\nprepared to travel to any hospital in the Greater\nLondon area usually at a moment's notice in\norder to try and save life. Sometimes it is possible\nto give up to twenty-four hours notice, ie when an\noperation is scheduled for a specific time.

Little did\nhe realise then that he was destined to become\neditor of no less than four publications.\nSteve was an unusually perceptive child whose\nwasp collection was the envy of many a friend at\nWood End Juniors school. At an early age he\nexhibited an aptitude for scientific investigation:\nhis mother was horrified to find a frog partially\ndissected on her bread board and was annoyed\nfurther when he boiled a piglet in caustic potash in\nher best aluminium saucepan. On another\noccasion he made nitrogen tri-iodide in his\ngarden shed laboratory and left it outside to dry.\nWhen he investigated a sudden bang he\ndiscovered the remains of the poor sparrow\nwhich had mistaken the black powder for food.\nIt is important that all S CC clubs and societies\ngive their account book to Dr Rzepa before the\nend of term.\nStephen Goulder\nSCC Chairman 1981/2\nSteve is planning to go to Australia next year,\nwith a holiday in South America in the\nintervening months. He is pictured here with his\nmother on Blackpool beach during an earlier\nexpedition.\nAnother early love of Steve's was money. He\ndecided that writing was a good way to earn extra\ncash, but eventually settled for cartooning. Soon\npapers of great repute (Titbits, Weekend, etc)\ncarried Marshall cartoons, the subject of which\nwere only limited by what would \" sell\". By\nstudying other cartoonists he developed his own\ndrawing style and brand of humour.\nIt was his cartooning abilities which led to his\ninvolvement in FELIX. On his first day at IC he\nwandered into the office and announced his\ndesire to contribute to the editor, Duncan Suss.\nPresuming that any editor would own a car, he\nthen cheekily asked for a lift with his belongings.\nDuncan managed to arrange a lift for him and\nthus secured a weekly cartoon from the keen\nChemistry fresher. With the encouragement of\nBill Tidy, Steve managed to become a member ot\nthe Cartoonists' Club of Great Britain, an\norganisation run by and for professional\ncartoonists.\nDuring his first summer vacation he produced a book of his cartoons which aroused in him a desire to edit the IC Rag Mag. Steve was very\nkeen to produce a memorable publication, which\nindeed he did. In fact it was during its production\nthat ht'first became a centre of controversy. The\nDeputy President, Malcolm Brain, was very\nconcerned, because the \"sick\" jokes and phallic\ncrossword that Steve intended to include were\ntotally unacceptable in his eyes. Despite the fuss\nand a threat to have his \"head caved in\" by the\nDP, he stuck to his guns and produced a classic\nRag Mag.\nIn his third year he took control of The Phoenix\nwhich was near extinction after failing to appear\nfor two years. By careful planning and an\nenormous amount of hard work he managed to\nraise the magazine back to its previous heights, as\nbefits a publication founded by HG Wells.\nDespite many sleepless nights pasting up he still\nmanaged to work hard on his degree and\ngraduated with an Upper Second last year.\nDuring his year as FELIX Editor Steve has once\nagain been the source of some controversial\nitems. His criticisms of Mr Mooney and Captain\nLindley may not have earned him friends in high\nplaces, but many students have expressed their\nenjoyment of such articles. Other Marshall ideas\nwere less popular, but even a series of U GM motions seemed to have no effect. He can only\nreally be judged by his results\u2014the issues which\nhe produced. These seem to have provoked a great deal of interest and have always been well\nread.\nDespite being FELIX Editor he has still\nremained relatively unknown in public. His\ndefence at UG Ms has been carried out by a staff\norator and his face is rarely pictured in the\nnewspaper. For some reason, presumably\nmodesty, he prefers not to be recognised. For a year he has lived in a semi\u2014nocturnal existence,\narriving late in the office and remaining there until\nthe small hours. \u2022\nIn recent months his plans for the next year\nhave been the cause of some amusement\namongst the staff. Firstly he decided to take 3\nmonths holiday in South America. We accidently\nespied his plans to take pot\u2014noodles and\nCadbury's Smash to the Andes, which raised a few titters, but \"three pairs socks, two pairs\npants\" for 3 months was hilarious. The need for\nvaccinations prompted Dr Haines' article in the\nprevious issue and he is still busy trying to\nmemorize all the types of poisonous snakes\nUnfortunately he has had to post one his little\njaunt in favour of setting up a PhD.... in Australia.\nSomehow we feel that Aussieland will be ideally\nsuited to Mr Marshall's requirements (and it is\nvery far away). However nobody has yet warned\nthe Australians. We wish him every success in\nthe venture.\nWe showed this article to Steve for his\ncomments. \"People might be interested,\" he said,\n...but if they're not stuff 'em!\"\nA rare picture of Steve taken during his\nGrammar School days. We feel that this picture\ncaptures his youthful enthusiasm and vitality\nwhich have remained with him throughout his\nyear as Editor.\n\n"

    "content": "Victor Mooney: The Truth. Despised and rejected, a figure of fun\nthroughout the College, many students feel\nVictor Mooney to be personally responsible\nfor the poor Refectory service. They see\nhim as the object for the hate and derision\nthat swells up in them when eating the\npoorly served\" cheeps\" and unnatural tasting meat courses. Powerless to struggle\nagainst the Refectories, with a Union which\nso often turns a blind-eye to the iniquity and\nunjust ness of Victor Mooney with his own\nyacht, how can such a student register his\ndisappointment with the menace of Mooney' s monster o us monopoly?\nOne very important thing to be remembered when considering the Refectory services, is that Victor Mooney has been at\nthis College for twenty-eight years.\nOne of the earliest references to Victor Mooney in FELIX was in 1955 when he took\nover all the College catering when Miss\n\" Queen i e\"B owning left, FELIX wished him\n\"the best of luck on his new, and difficult\nventure\".\nLater on that year in a Suggestions Book someone wrote \" Good old Mooney! Keep up the good work! Keep off the g! opposite which the \"dietician-in-chief\" wrote\n\" noted\". Taking into account the proposition that students were in those days\na bit more civil, \"keep up the good work\" is\nstill a congratulatory remark. How many\npeople today, twenty-six years later, would\nfeel able to similarly praise him?\nTripping through the years, to1956, Victor Mooney again has praise heaped\nupon him, this time for his \"magnificent and\ndetermined effort\" in opening a new refectory in one day, despite set backs\nwhich would have \"de moral is eda lesser\nPraise\nThese are some examples of the laudatory statements made about Victor\nMooney, and at no stage is there even the\nmerest hint of Union criticism of him. But a few things need to be remembered about\nevents at that time. Firstly, Mr Mooney was\na vivacious thirty-three year-old full of new\nideas and eager to please, there were less\nstaff which created a better atmosphere,\nand those staff showed some sign of pride in\ntheir work. Also, at that time, the College\nwas much smaller and easier to run.\nDecrepitude\nMeanwhile in1957, Mr Mooney was\nexperimenting to cut the size of \"enormous\nsupper queues\". Perhaps those experiments worked too well. At this time also\nIC's catering began in this writer's view it's long process of collapsing into an inexorable pit of decrepitude. For instance the\nSuggestions Book contains remarks about\npeas; comparing them to lead shot, green\nbullets and indigestible ball-bearings. The substance of the complaints has remained\nfairly similar although since then the style\nhas changed; eg \" The white of an egg was\nrubbery, the yoke more so. The peas were\nhard. The chips were leathery and the whole\ndish was quite cold.\" And,\" For sometime I have been confused regarding engineering\nterms, eg ductility, rigidity, tensile strength,\nhardness and brittleness. Your pastry demonstrates the lot.\"( A possible first\nreference to THE baked minced beef roll?)\nComplaints\nIn 1961, Mr Mooney was personally attacked in FELIX for ignoring suge st ions and complaints, and for his total in d if ference. Could this possibly be the same Mr Mooney who only six years earlier was hailed as a hero by the Union? Yes. At the start of the Autumn term, 1961\nFELIX reported the long queues in the\nRefectory. At this time, the demand outstripped the supply, and the staff had to\ntry very hard to get everyone served.\nEven in1961 though, complaints of\nextraneous materials finding their way into\nhelpings of food were made, eg a \"bundle of\nwire, two thirds of which I unfortunately\nswallowed while eating your otherwise excellent apple pie\". Mr Mooney gave his\nnow familiar reply of asking the complainants to take the meal back to the\ncounter at the time.\nBring it back\nThis simple request\u2014bring it back at the\ntime\u2014is one of the best defensive ploys\nused by Victor Mooney to keep criticism of\nthe refectories to a minimum; why else use it\nfor twenty years? What student is going to\nrisk the disgruntle ment of others by returning to the counter to make a complaint about the food to the staff who\noften, through no fault of their own, find\ndifficulty understanding English, thus holding up the queue and upsetting an already touchy staff member. A cry of \"the\npeas are cold today\" might be better, and a warning like \"don't have the salad, there's glass in it\" would surely help others to avoid\nthe odd dish that even Mr Victor Mooney admits \"we fall down on\". Victor Mooney hit the headlines again in\n1973. He was condemned for his attitude to\nUnion meetings, having \"developed a fine\nart in fending off questions like some d is pasion ate observer. Listening to his Union meeting offerings it seemed hardly credible\nthat he has any responsibilities towards IC\ncatering at all\". Also\" Mr Mooney' s general\naims seemed to be to pass on the blame and\nresponsibility to others. Price 'increases' are\nthe fault of cashiers overcharging, the\ncontinuance of the habit is the fault of\nstudents not complaining, and the fault for\nthe bad quality of the food lies with the\nrefectories having too many customers.\"\nPropaganda\nThis photograph shows a typical meal sewed up in an IC refectory; shrivelled chips,\ncongealed beans, and an un recognisable third portion.\nThis is an example of the long catalogue\nof lies and deceitful propaganda put about\n\n"

    "content": "Letters to\nthe Editor\nDear Sir\nI must apologise to J Murphy and anybody else too stupid to\nsee through my 'slip ol the pen' in\ndescribing the arms industry as\n' labour intensive' in the last\nC ND column. It is of course\ncapital-intensive, and equivalent\ninvestment in many other industries such as housing and energy\nconservation creates far more\njobs. Hence the connection between the arms race and unemployment.\nMurphy brings out the tired\nold chestnut and accuses ICC ND of being communists. We're supported by people ranging from the left to the\ncentre, including IC Catholic\nChaplaincy, and we adopt neither a pro-Soviet nor proN A TO stance. On a national\nscale the entire Quaker movement is in C ND \u2014 hardly com-munis ts. To accuse us of being\ncommunists is as stupid and irrelevant as if I were to accuse\nthe vociferous right in the College of being neo-Nazis or\nassociated with the National Front; a suggestion from which\nI'm sure they would recoil in\nhorror.\nBearing in mind the above.\nMurphy' s implication that we\nare intellectually handicapped is\na joke. I have yet to see any antiC ND writer back his or her\narguments with references to\nanything concrete (our leaflets\nalways contain references); the\nstandard technique of Murphy and Benita Cortazzi is personal\ninsult and libellous accusation.\nSo whose is the intellectual\nhandicap?\nYours\nIan Heavens\nBA( Hons) (Cantab)\nPhysics PG ICC ND Group Dear Sir\nWe were very surprised to see\nthat you don't think we are\nboring, it's so nice to know. We\ndo not agree however, wc think\nthat the students are very boring,\nand that FELIX is too. The standards are so low these days.\nThe letter from Messrs Hayward and Hollie is a prime example.\nIt is meaningless pill lc, it ,a ys nothing. We do not consider that\nthis sort of pur ile rubbish (which\nwas late anyway) is the sort of\nthing which should be published\nin a paper which supposedly\ncaters for a selection of the most\nintelligent people in the country.\nSo much for an active letters\npage.\nIt is also our opinion that\nFELIX relies on too many overworked clich es. The 'jokes' are\nalways the same. The Captain\nLindley joke is a case in point: we\nasked him how many times FELIX had used this joke, and\nhe said \" I don't know, I don't stand and count 'em, and it's not\nup to me to count them either.\"\nQED. Can we have an interesting FELIX please?\nWe do hope that you are\nkeeping well, and that you enjoy\nyour holiday.\nYours sincerely\nJohn Hollie , Zoo 2\nDavid Ha v ward, Biochem 2\nDear Sir\nI should like to say that whatever\neverybody else thinks, I for one\nactually enjoyed reading FELIX this year. In a College where\nnothing ever happens it is\nobviously difficult to run a newspaper and personally I would much rather read about\nBob Pegg selling out than boring\nrubbish about boring Union all airs. I have also observed that\nthe principal activity of IC students (apart from drinking)\nseems to be making groundless\ninsults about each other. It would\ntherefore seem logical for a representative newspaper to do\nthe same especially since the\nletters pages are filled, week-in\nweek-out, with verbal attacks on\nthe editor.( It strikes me, incidentally, that such letters\nwould never be printed in any\nother newspaper.) How many ol\nthese critics oiler to write articles\nthemselves? Or better still, go out\nand do something newsworthy. A spectacular suicide would make a good story, and I can think of\nseveral people who would benefit\nfrom doing just that. Finally,\nsince so many people have taken\na stand against your comments\nabout Victor Mooney. all I can\nsay is: if God had intended us to\neat Mooneys, he would not have\ngiven us taste buds.} ours\nEdgar Shave It (a nag) Physics abandoned\nDear Mr Marshall\nI believe your friend calls you\nSteve, at the end of May a group\nof boring students in the middle\nof equally boring exams went to\nChiswick Amateur Regatta and\nwon not just one race but in a staid unexciting fashion won the\ncompetition by blasting the\nopposition by more than two\nboat lengths in every race. Amazed by their own mediocrity\nthe IC Xovice Four submitted a suitably ridiculous article which,\ndespite the fact that I did not\nwrite it, you considered too\nboring lor print.\nIf being insulting is the only\nway to get into FELIX then I think you're a sod.\n1 ou rs h ig/iea de dlr Number 3\nDear Sir\nToday the British Government is\nreaping the rewards of a policy of\ncontinually backing up the\nLoyalist people in Ireland.\nThroughout the centuries the\nLoyalists have bad their way.\nWhenever they demanded anything they got it, eg when they\nwanted to divide Ireland they\nWere backed by the British Government, or whenever they\ndid not agree to power-sharing\nwith the Catholic minority, they\nopposed it and had their way.\nBritain, with this policy has\nsucceeded in creating one of the\nmost reactionary' and bigoted\ngroups of people in the world; the\nLoyalists of N Ireland in a spectrum of racism and bigotry\nwould be classified with other\nracists and fascists such as the Ku' Klux Klan or Nazis. (For further\nreading on this aspect read The\nProles/ants of I Isler by Geolfrey\nBell, a liberal Protestant from N Ireland. This book analyses the\nLoyalist mentality and is a must\nfor anyone trying to understand\nthe N Ireland situ t ation.) In the early part of this century\nthe Loyalists were handed the\nreins of government of the\nartificially created state of N Ireland. This state was characterized by Orange Pogroms, state\nviolence and massive discrimination against the minority com-m unity, not to mention rule by\nthe same par ly for fifty years.\nThe tone of repression in N Ireland may be gu aged from the\nfact that Mr Vorstere, the South\nAfrican minister lor justice wished in 1963 for \" just one\nclause in the N Ireland Special\nPowers Act\" in exchange for all\nhis own coercive legislation.\nIt was no sup rise to read the\ncontents of Mr Boucher's letter in\nlast week's FELIX. Mr Boucher's letter' contains that curious mixture of untruths, distort in s of\nreality, paranoia concerning unfavourable opinion of their\n\"wee Ulster\" and tunnel vision\nwith respect to Republicans, that\nis peculiar to the Ulster Loyalist\nspecies.\nMr Boucher's statement \"that\nLoyalist paramilitaries have only\ndeveloped in response to the\nGovernment's non committed actions in N Ireland,\" is untrue.\nThe British Government began\ndirect rule in 1972 and the UVF were murdering innocent Catholics in 1966, eg Gusty Spence,\nleader of the UVF, is at present\nserving a tile sentence Ib r murdering a Catholic in 1966.\nFurthermore, has Mr Boucher\nnever heard of the ' B' specials, a slate controlled paramilitary organisation disbanded by the\nBritish Government embarrassed\nby their murderous activities?\nMi Bouchers ignorance of the\nsituation is further exemplified\nby the statement that \" these Loyalists arc not well armed\".\nThe Loyalists own the vast bulk\nof the 104.000 legally held firearms certificates in N Ireland,\nand have a lot al monopoly on\nrifle .clubs. In 1974 the IDA boasted of having 50.000 men.\nThe U DR currently have 7.000\nfull and part-time members, the\nRUC have 8.000, the British Army have11.600. not lo mention the U FF, the U Y F. the\nOrange Volunteers, the Red Hand Commandoes and Mr Paisley's( whom Mr Boucher refers to as a moderate-) private\narmy, recently revealed to\njournalists on a mountain top.\nHow can anyone with any intelligence claim that the\nLoyalists are not well-armed?\nMr Boucher states that the\nworld media are constantly \"getting it wrong\". Has it ever\noccurred to Mr Boucher that\nperhaps they are \" getting it\nright\" and that bis views are not\nsupported anywhere but in N Ireland and Britain? This is a classic symptom of the Loyalist\nmentality, disbelief in any derogatory comment about their\n\"wee Ulster\", from the world\npress.\nFinally Mr Boucher's statement \"that most paramilitaries'\nactions are against Republican\nsympathies\" would be laughable\nif the situation was not so serious.\nAs a vici m of, and witness to\nOrange og roms and assassination\nattempts in the early 1970s in N Ireland, let me assure Mr Boucher that the only qualification necessary for murder by\nLoyalist paramilitaries inN Ireland is the misfortune to have\nbeen born a Catholic. (For an\nanalysis of motivation of murders\nin N Ireland read Political Murder\nin V Ireland, a book published in\nthe early 1970s.) If Mr Boucher insists on writing letters let's hope he gets\nhis facts right next time.\nIt is obvious to everyone in the\nworld except the British GovernConlinued on page 4.\n\n"

    "content": "Lindley in the Dock\nJohn William Gat butt Lindley, came to this College three years ago after a long career In\nthe Royal Navy. He rose to the rank of Captain and was a Naval Aide-de-camp to the\nQueen. He was Flag Captain to the Flag Officer for Scotland and Northern Ireland and\nCommander of HMS Cochrane (usually known as Rosyth Naval Base). As Domestic\nSecretary he is in overall charge of many areas of College, eg Refectories, Halls of\nResidence, Security. So that students may gain a better knowledge of him, FELIX Is proud\nto present a telephone conversation with him which occured last November. The topic of\ndiscussion is the visit to College of Prince Phillip in connection with the Duke of Edinburgh\nAward Scheme. We had hoped to pad out the story with a few factual details concerning\nthe visit and felt Captain Lindley might have been able to help us.\nThe following text is a complete and accurate report of the ensuing conversation and\ncontains the now infamous sentence concerning Captain Lindley's numeracy. We feel\nCaptain Lindley says more about himself in this short exchange than we ever could!\nGood afternoon. I'm Sean Giblin from FELIX.\nI'd like to ask you some questions about the\nvisit of the Duke of Edinburgh to College\ntoday. Could we have some information\nwhich might be of interest to students for this\nweek's FELIX?\nWhat is it that you want to know?\nWe'd like to know why he was here, and\nsomething about the Duke of Edinburgh\nAward scheme.\n.Well, at the moment, just a minute, I have no\nsecretary, and I'm right up to my eyes. I 've no\ntime to deal with the matter. You're right, he\nhas been here all day, for the Duke of\nEdinburgh Award Scheme.\n(At this point some rowdies entered the\nFELIX Office. Mr Giblin asked to be excused\nto deal with them, and Capt Lindley put the\nphone down. Mr Giblin phoned back. The\ntelephone rang fifty-eight times (we counted\n'em!) without Capt Lindiey answering it. Mr\nGiblin tried again, and Capt Lindley picked it\nup immediately.)\nCaptain Lindley\nGood afternoon. It's Sean Giblin again. I contacted\nOh, never mind that\nMr Butcher and then Miss O 'Callaghan, who\nreferred me to you.\nLook. At the moment I 've got quite a few\nthings. Can you come over in the morning\nand have a quick chat?\nWell, I don't think there's enough time for that\nreally, we'd like it in this week's issue if at all\npossible.\nWhat is it you want to know particularly?\nWell\nFirst of all, you must understand that we\nprovide facilities, as it were, um, we're not\ninvolved in the detailed running of the thing. I mean, what they do, their programme and so\non, they set up themselves.\nWhat was particularly interesting was that\nwhen I asked Miss O 'Callaghan what was\ngoing on, she said that she had been told by\nthe Palace not to make any comment\nwhatsoever on the visit of Prince Phillip\nNow hang on., .hang on. Just a minute, just a minute. Let's get that in perspective.\nThat's exactly what she said to me.\nLook, do you want to know what the Duke of\nEdinburgh Award Scheme is about?\nWe've got enough information on that. What\nis particularly interesting is that why, when\nwe asked for information from College, we\nwere stonewalled. I 've been in touch with the\nPress Association to ask them if they know\nanything about the Duke's visit to College,\nand they were most surprised when I said that\nwe couldn't get any information from College\nWell, look. What I'm going to do, is to talk\nabout the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme,\nnot what somebody said. All that happened\nwas that yesterday afternoon we got a question about TV recording, and we had to\nask whether this was, er, agreed with the\norganisers etc and the answer was No, they\ndid not wish it to be done. Full stop. That's all\nit is. There's no mystery.\nSo a statement that no additional press\ncoverage is required is false?\nYou telling me? Look, I'm not going to get\ninvolved in this kind of enquiry\u2014you must\ncome and see me. I do not conduct telephone\nconversations of this sort. I understand you\nwanted me to talk about the Duke of\nEdinburgh Award Scheme. That I am quite\nprepared to do.\nWe'd like to know how long this event has\nbeen arranged for as well, for example, how\nlong ago the JCR was booked.\nOh, I can look that up. I don't know off hand,\nbut it wasn't done five minutes ago, I can tell\nyou. I mean it was done some time ago, and it\nwas done properly. So there's no mystery\nabout that either.\nJust to check a few facts, were there 550\nvisitors?\nI wouldn't know, I don't count 'em. Look what\nis we're trying to do? Do you want to know\nabout the visit or not?\nYou must understand\nI'm not going to understand anything.\nany information that I 've got has been\nobtained with great difficulty because of the\napparent attitude in College block\nThere isn't an attitude in College block. Don't try and manufacture something where there\nisn't anything. There is no attitude at all. If\nyou want to talk to me about the Duke of\nEdinburgh Award Scheme, I'm perfectly\nhappy so to do. If you start saying to me were\nthere 550 visitors, the answer is I don't know,\nI don't stand and count 'em, and it's not up to\nme to count them either but there were\nquite a lot.\nDo you know roughly where they all came\nfrom?\nAll over the country.\nAnd that satisfies your concern. You're not\nabsolutely sure how many people are here\nOh God, I don't know.\nIf I'd got this information from somewhere\nelse I wouldn't have had to bother you.\nLook. It isn'ta question of bothering me. The\nDuke of Edinburgh Award Scheme hired the\nGreat Hall. I don't know how many people.\nWe know roughly. I suppose if I went down\nand asked Mr Mobney how many for lunch\netc, etc, he could probably tell me precisely.\nBut I don't see quite what this does. You say\n\"Where do they come from?\" I know, because\nI 've got a list in front of me. It doesn't say they\ncame from well, you know, Manchester,\nGlasgow and so on, but I'm not in v ov led in\norganising the conference.\nI had hoped you might have been able to tell\nme about foreign visitors. Were there any\nfrom abroad?\nYes, that is correct, I'm sure, because I saw\n'em, but as to where they came from, I don't know. We're simply not told that kind of\ninformation. But it's the Tenth General\nCouncil and Sixth International Conference\n1980 and that's what we know. They were\nwelcomed by the Rector, at 11:30am er it\nreally isn't up to us. They run their own show,\nnot us.\nIs it common for this to happen? I would have\nthought that of all the people in College, you,\nCaptain Lindley, would have been privy to the\nmost detailed information available concerning what's going on.\nOf course we don't know. Why should you\nsuppose that? But anyway, we're getting a long, long way from what we're talking about.\nAre we talking about the Duke of Edinburgh\nAward Scheme or not? I'm trying to be\nhelpful. You're trying to lead me into various\nsorts of situations\nWell, I think, Captain Lindley, that you've got\nthe wrong impression of\nHave I? people who write for FELIX.\nLook, I'm perfectly happy to help you if you\nwant some information about the Duke of\nEdinburgh Award Scheme as far as I'm aware\nof it. But if you ask me who came from where\nand so on, they know, I don't. So people from outside IC can come in and\nhave a conference and people in authority\nsuch as yourself don't actually know what is\ngoing on, and short of rough details\nNo, no, no, no, no. That's not what we're say ing, that's just not what we're saying. To say\nthat you don't know what's going on because\nyou don't have a total list of every visitor,\nthat's just not so. We have students there, we\ncould talk about what the Duke of Edinburgh\nAward Scheme does and that sort of thing, but\nyou know that already, if you ask me\nquestions that I can answer, then I willingly\nwill, but I do not want for a moment that you\nshould feel that anybody is trying to suppress\nanything, because if you suggest that, then\nI'm sorry, but you've got the wrong end of the\nstick.\nI'm glad to hear that. It's just unfortunate that\nthe only person in College who has actually\nsaid that is yourself. Thank you very much\nCaptain Lindley. Goodbye.\n\n"

    "content": "by Victor Mooney over the last two decades. No student has the knowledge or tim e to fully challenge the statements. Student representatives on the various refectory committees could find it easy to\nbe taken in by Victor Mooney's false facade\nof concern about the standard of catering\nhere.\nIn 1970, the un hy geni c nature of the\nkitchens was widely reported in The Sun,\nwhen refectory boycotts were organised\nand aUG M passed a motion of no confidence in the refectory chairman at\nthat time. Replying to accusations of cockroach infestation Mr Jim Kearns a College employee told The Sun they were\n\" hogwash\", because there were cock roaches in all kitchens.\nStupid\nDuring the early 7 0 s there was much criticism of the high price rises in the refectories as a whole, but despite the boycotts and U GM motions, nothing was\ndona. In 1975 Mr Mike Williams, an ex FELIX Editor complained bitterly about the\nstupid attitudes taken by Victor Mooney and Peter Teague, then ICU President.\nVictor Mooney tried to increase refectory\nprices by 40% without increasing the quality;\nMr Teague wanted refectory boycotts. Mr( Williams called for each side to trust each\nother. I suggest that this Union has trusted\nVictor Mooney long enough, and he has\nbeen all too willing to betray that trust.\nWhy?\nBut why is the refectory service so bad?\nThere are many possible replies to this\noften asked question. Victor Mooney' s favourite answer is \" We have to provide a capacity service until Christmas and for half\nthat number for the rest of the year.\" Let's consider that answer a bit more fully. Victor Mooney lets out an interesting figure. For one term the refectories are used heavily\nand for the other two terms not so heavily,\nbut at no time is the food any good. Whether pushed to capacity or ticking over,\nVictor Mooney just can't seem to get the\ncatering right. Secondly, Victor Mooney seems aware that the numbers using the refectories is dropping all the time. I suggest that this is because, at first, the\nrefectories are used in the main by students\nin their first year at College. As time progresses those students become more\nsettled in, cooking for themselves, or finding\nlocal eating places.\nExcuse\nAnother popular excuse for the catering\nhere, is that the refectories and bars have to\nbe self-financing. College decided that it's UGC grant would be spent on mainly acca demi c expenditure, thus making it\nharder for the UGC to cut IC's without\nharming College academically. So the refectory service has to pay it's own way. If\nit makes a loss it can be bailed out by the\nBar profits, but nothing else. One year's loss\nwould have to be recouped by next year's higher prices.\nCOCKROACH\nMENU AT\nCOLLEGE\nSTUDENTS at a London college protested angrily abou f the cock roaches.\nThey found them in the\nkitchens and in the halls\nof residence.\nSome of the insects even\nscuttled around the com mon rooms while students watched tele-vision, says the. magazine of students at the\nImperial College of\nScience and Technology.\nIt was the last straw when\nthree students found\ncockroaches in their vol au-vent.\n\" \" Hogwash' Students are now planning\nto boycott the dining\nhall.\nStudent William Honeyborne said yesterday:\n\" Sprays no longer have\nany effect because there\nare so many cock-roaches.\n\" We canon t give the date\nof the boycott because\nwe do not want it anticipated in the kitchens.\"\nCollege staff member Jim Kearns, said: \" These\ncomplaints are a lot of\nhogwash. In all kitchens\nthere are a certain num ber of cockroaches.\"\nAn extract from The Sun, January 19\n1970. If Mr Mooney were a commercial\ncaterer he would probably hit the headlines\nmore often.\nBut there are other reasons which might\nhelp to explain the situation. If the uncooked food is of a poor quality, then no matter how well cooked, in a fly less, cockroach less kitchen, by experienced staff, it still will come out as rubbish, eg a sausage made of sawdust will never be \"fit\nfor a King\"( or Prince Phillip).\nBut even \"sawdust sausages\" could not\nbe expected to survive the battering given\nto them in Mooney' s kitchens.\nI said it was important to recall that Victor Mooney has been at this College for a long\ntime. During that period he has built up good relationships with many influential\npeople in College and the Union. He has\nbeen made a member of at least two C CU drinking clubs\u2014no doubt for his services to\nannual dinners, and by assisting the rising\nstars in College has made life a bit easier for\nhimself. When dign a tories have visited the\nCollege, eg for Meet IC or Royal Visits,\nVictor Mooney has ensured that the food is\nof the highest quality\u2014thus giving a false\nimpression of the catering here. Whilst the\nfunctional catering is often to be highly\nrecommended, it must be remembered that\nthe Refectories are here to provide a service\nto students and staff, not to entertain rich\noutsiders.\nImmunity\nOver the years then, I suggest that Victor Mooney has built up an almost complete\nimmunity from criticism aimed at him personally, or at the branch of the domestic\nservice he is personally responsible for\nmaintaining. This does not help, because\nthe authorities in the Union often want\npeople in College to be criticised, in the\nhope of getting some action out of them. If\nserious criticism is not accepted, then only\nsatire and sarcasm are left.\nCriticism\nThe criticisms of Victor Mooney and the\ncatering have tended to overshadow what is\nbeing criticised. The catering has become a long-standing joke, and students no doubt\nask themselves is it really worth bothering\nto complain, is it really worth causing a fuss?\nI suggest that because of the nature of the\ncomposition of the College few students are\nprepared to struggle against the refectory\nsystem. Within the first few weeks they have\nbecome ground down by the food and are\nmore interested in their degree than in taking part in any process of change. The College authorities must not think for one minute that the lack of action by the Union and the often humorous attitude add opted by FELIX toward Mr Mooney means that\nthe catering here is grudgingly accepted by\n\"the silent majority\" of students, because it\nis most emphatically not.\nPeroration\nIn the 1950s Victor Mooney was regarded\nas a competent refectory manager. Since\nthat time, the size of the College has grown,\nthe demands made on the refectory manager have increased, and Victor Mooney's reputation has taken a tumble. I suggest that this is because the job has gone\noutside his ability. Despite the most ferocious criticism of him in FELIX and at\nUnion meetings over the last twenty years,\nthere has been no general improvement in\nthe taste or reduction in the extortionate\nprices of refectory food.\nWhy should IC be so sadly strike n with\nsuch u nap pet ising food? Why should the\nfood remain so bad for so long, even though\nthe kitchens have the most up to date equipment? I believe that there is one connection between these and all the points\never made about the food here in the last 28\nyears. That connection is none other than\nVictor Mooney. The plain truth is that Victor Mooney simply isn't up to his job of organising the\ncatering here. It's not an easy job, there are\nmaybe only a small number of people who could do it. Unfortunately, Victor Mooney isn'tone of that small number.\nWhatever good he has done, whatever\nwrong he has suffered, this writer asks you to accept that Victor Mooney should never\nhave been given control of the catering\nhere, that no one regrets it more than those\nresponsible for his appointment and Victor Mooney himself, there can be no improvement in the catering whilst Victor Mooney is\nstill here, so the sooner he goes the better.\n\n"

    "content": "FREEMASONRY\nA Helping Hand in College?\nTHE FIRST DEGREE GRIP: recognised by all masons as the universal\nhandshake. Notice that the thumb presses into the first joint of the forefinger\nwhere it meets the hand.\nFollowing the recent controversy over the\nP2 Lodge in Italy and the almost inevitable\ncorruption that follows after all the higher\nechelons of a society dedicate themselves\nto perpetuating their own interests, the\nEditor decided to investigate the part\nFreemasonry plays in the running of\nImperial College. The subject of Freemasonry is, by its very nature, poorly\npublicised and there can be few non Freemasons who have any knowledge of the\nCraft itself, let alone its influence in the\nCollege. This article attempts to shed a little light on both, but cannot hope to be\ndefinitive. Belonging to a masonic lodge\nshould not be thought of as a crime. The\nauthor feels that while the true concept of\nmasonry itself is not necessarily a point of\ncontention, it does indeed provide a means\nof corruption.\nThe popularised view amongst non Freemasons is that Masons are a group of\npeople who wander round from top job to\ntop job by simply knowing the right secret\nhandshake, and prance around half-naked\nwhen being initiated into the Lodge. The popularised view amongst Masons is that\nnon-Masons have no idea what the secret\nhandshake is ('cos it's secret) and couldn't possibly know what happens during a Mason's initiation. Well, the former description is not far from the truth and the\nlatter statement is way off the mark as\nMasonic literature may be obtained with\n(relative) ease.( See other sources of\nreferences list at end.)\nThe Masonic Craft is based on King Solomon's Temple; all references in the\ninitiation ceremonies and curious passwords\nare derived from this source and may be\nread about quite freely in Walton Hannah's excellent book Darkness Visible.\nWalton Hannah( a non-Freemason), who\nis now in Canada, researched the book\nwhile he was a Churchman based in Queensgate, in conjunction with a senior\nmember of the academic staff at IC. Mr Hannah obtained information by posing as a Mason utilising Masonic robes sold off by a Mason's widow. An enlightening book, well\nworth a read if you can find a copy.\nOn first impressions, Freemasons might\nbe regarded as kids who have not yet grown\nup. Freemasonry cannot be dismissed so easily when one realises there are over half a million Freemasons in Great Britain alone.\nMost occupy senior jobs and are pledged to\nhelp one another out when \" in need\", even\nthough the individuals may be complete\nstrangers to each other. They recognise one\nanother firstly by a Universal Handshake, more correctly called the \"First Degree\" or\n\" Entered Apprentice\" handshake( see below) and then later by dropping formations of words from the Masoni c ritual\ninto everyday conversation, eg reference to\na knife and fork in a restaurant as \" working tools\". There are even Masonic gestures\nwhich to the unsuspecting non-Freemason\nwould go totally unnoticed, eg drawing one's glass across the throat before drinking,\nwhich is an extension of a \"cut my throat\nand hope to die\" penal sign of the First\nDegree.\nHow a Mason\" uses\" his massive collection of \" connections\" depends, of\ncourse, on the individual's personality. On one hand, Freemasonry is a large, very\nactive social club that collects money for\ncharity and provides funds for a hospital\n(the Royal Masonic Hospital\u2014there is one\nnear Hamlet Gardens), but on the other it\ncan be seen as an unfair route to positions\nwhich would be harder to reach by conventional means and, at an extreme,\ndownright corruption as in Italy.\nI have mentioned the\" Degree\" of Freemasonry. There are three main levels of\nthe Craft,\" First Degree\" or\" Entered Apprentice\"; \" Second Degree\" or \"Fellow-Craft\"; \" Third Degree\" or \" Master Mason\". After this comes the \" Royal Arch\", but I will\nnot dwell on this here. Masons of all\ndegrees may belong to the same Lodge,\nwhich usually opens its ceremonies in the\nFirst Degree (at which Second and Third\nDegree Masons are present). The Lodge or\nMasonic Temple should ideally be in the\nform of a double cube facing East and West.\nThe head of the Lodge, the Worshipful\nMaster, sits in the East. His emblem, the\nStone Masons tee-square is usually carved\nor painted on his pedestal. The Masonic\nsymbols of a square and compasses usually\nrest on a cushion with the Volume of Sacred\nLaw. The Worshipful Master's direct subordinate, the Senior Wardens its opposite in the West. The Junior Warden( with plumb line emblem) sits in the South. Then we have Past Masters, the Senior\nand Junior Deacons and the Inner Guard. These are the \"officers\" of a Masonic Lodge\nand control all of its functions and are\ninstrumental in the initiation of a new Candidate to the Lodge. Outside the temple\nstands the Tyler, the outer guard to the\nmeeting who helps candidates dress for\ninitiation and \"fends off\" intruders.\nThe ordinary Masons wear aprons to\nindicate their Degree. The First is of plain\nwhite lambskin, the Second is the same but\nwith two blue rosettes in the lower corners\nand the Third is bordered with blue, has\nmetal t as s les and a third rosette in the point\nof the flap. Office bearers wear jewels and\nemblems of their office from collars of blue\nsilk.\nA different floor covering( a\"t racing board\") is laid down dependent on which\nDegree the Lodge is conducting its business\nin. When the Lodge transfers from First\nDegree to Second Degree it does so to the\nexclusion of the First Degree Masons, who\nare asked to leave. There are recognisable\nhandshakes of the various degrees, and these are used during the rituals; the First\nDegree grip being recognised by ALL Masons is often THE Mason's grip. Photographs illustrating the Second and Third Degree grips are shown below.\nBesides the popularised handshakes, there are signs and gestures ranging from\npenal to the\" Sign of Sympathy\" and passwords used in the rituals.\nMembership is by invitation on the recommendation of a Mason. If the candidate (who should be over twenty-one\nand male) accepts he undergoes an initiation ceremony during which he is\nblindfolded, made to roll up his left trouser\n\n"

    "content": "I feel that this Editorial is going to be somewhat\nof an anti-climax to those of you who expect\nme to slag off all those lazy, inefficient ponce s who have the audacity to call themselves\nUnion Officers or College administrators. I have nothing specific to say about anything at\nthe moment and everything you are about lo\nread is purely a collection of jottings that come\nto mind as I sit here thinking about ways of\nfilling the entire back page.\nI will resist the temptation to recount\npersonal i a as I understand the F EL JX staff are\nknocking something together about me\noverleaf \"(dread the thought!). Some people\nthis year have accused me (or even praised\nme, dare I say it) for being far too outspoken\nand downright rude.\nI must admit that I never intended to\nbecome notorious as FELIX Editor or to\nimpose my character on FELIX to the extent\nthat I have. I originally aimed to take a laid-back approach, keeping out of the limelight (as\nit were), adding balance here and there with an\neditorial comment on a few pertinent issues.\nThen Dare Afolabi came along! It all started\nwhen Mark Smith (Editor-elect) chopped the\nlast paragraph off his Afro-Carib article to\nmake it fit\u2014it just h appended to be about\napartheid. He assumed I( it wasn't even me)\nhad \"censored\" him. (Don't they always?).\nMr Afolabi sent me as to rmer of a letter\naccusing me of infringing the ICU Constitution,\ncensorship, and worst of all, restricting freedom of expression. Nothing annoys me\nmore than being accused of acting against one\nof my own strong beliefs\u2014I 've always been\nstrongly in favour of freedom of expression\u2014\nno matter how right-wing or left-wing your\nviews may be. Nevertheless, I kept my cool.\nThen Afolabi sent another letter and another,\nand another I reacted. My reaction provoked a chain reaction. Feedback is<\npleasing, positive or negative; I started to take\nmore personal interest in FELIX and have\nused it to provoke interest ever since.\nHowever, I would add that I hold Mr Afolabi\nand others like him in considerable contempt, I am not racist (IAM sexist), and I believe the\napartheid system is very, very wrong.\nWhile the members of the Anti-Apartheid\nGroup deserve every praise for their determined efforts, they must realise they will\nachieve nothing concrete. The only situation\nwhere they could have gained some headway\nconcerned the admission of white South African students to the College's nuclear\ntechno l of fi/ course. Without wishing to be\nlabelled as a evil supporter of the Fascist\nRegime, I cannot agree with this move as, like\nthe Rector, I believe academic freedom is a far\nmore important consideration.\nWere the left-wingers to actively campaign\nabout things closer to home such as\nrefectories, Hall rents and the College's determined efforts to waste thousands of\npounds on utter flops such as Meet IC then\nthis place might be just a little more lively.\nI have attempted to keep FELIX concentrated firmly on internal matters this year and I believe this is the right policy\u2014perhaps this\nthe reason why UG Ms failed so abysmally this\nyear. I have criticised the Union, or more\ncorrectly, its officers without second thought\nfor the continuance of a\" good working working relationship\" with them. I detest most\nof them anyway. John Passmore, who still\ninsists on greeting me pleasantly, will be\nforgotten next year, tucked away on his Phd in\nthe Mines department, which lowered their\nusual high standards in accepting him. However, personalities in College administration (Viee-tr Mooney and Captain Lindley\ncome eagerly to mind) will still be here next\nyear. Victor Mooney is hardened to criticism\nafter twenty years of it, so I attempted a new\napproach this year. The \"New Years Honours\nShock\" seemed to cause quite a jolly stir (you\nshould have seen the original article we\ndecided NOT to print). I was surprised by the\noutcry, I must admit. I had no official\ncorrespondence from Victor Mooney himself\nbut the Rector was disgusted. John Passmore\nagreed with the Rector that it was disgusting (I saw him laughing!). I was told by a senior\nSherfield man sympathetic to the cause, that\n\"it is not unusual for a senior refectory\nmanager who often caters for Royalty with\nthirty-years experience to receive a CBE or\nsomething similar\". It was suggested that I had\nhit Victor Mooney below the belt. My re post was the same as always, Victor Mooney has\nbeen hitting us all below the belt for many\nyears. Even when the College are eventually\nfind of him, the refectories will still need a good\nfive years sorting out. It's simply pathetic.\nCaptain Lindley is altogether another kettle\nof fish. Prior to this year, the Captain had\ncome off lightly, if mentioned at all, in the\npages of FELIX. I believe that my predecessors\nwere actually put off by his pretentious use of\nrank. I find it difficult to have any faith in the\nnaval defence of this country after meeting and\ntalking to Captain Lindley. The amazing thing\nis that the top officers in the Sherfield Building\ntalk about the Captain in a far more cutting\nmanner than I would ever consider publishing.\nNot only has he been a figure of fun in the\nUnion, but also in Sherfield. What a pity Topic\ndoesn't have a gossip column! This man has\nthe responsibilities which most directly affect\nstudents. As Domestic Secretary, he is Victor\nMooney' s boss, in overall charge of all refectories and bars; he has direct responsibility for Halls of Residence and Houses; he is\nin charge of the booking of rooms and all\ncleaners; and, to top it all, he looks after the\nsecurity of the entire College. Too much responsibility for one man, without having to\ncontend with FELIX as well (not to mention\nMeet IC) you might well say. Obviously.\nSome of the thing I never got round to. I would have liked to have had more feature\narticles but there just weren't enough staff to\nwrite them. I had envisaged an article on\nCollege-owned flats; you know, the ones they\ndon't tell students about, leave vacant for ages,\nthen move in some College person for a few\nweeks, on a \"need basis\". How many people\nrealise there are two fully-furnished flats in the\nUnion Building? I'm not sure if many in the\nUnion realise it. These two flats are marked\nonly by unassuming front doors on the west\nstaircase of the Union Building and are omitted\nfrom the diagram in the Handbook. They are\nboth known as \"Refectory Flats\", intended for\npeople in the refectory service\u2014often those\nwho work in the Union Refectory, so that they\nhaven't far to walk in the mornings pre sum ably. The flats are let at very low rates. The\ndisgraceful thing is that one of these flats has\nbeen left empty for two years! OK, flat-hunters, now you know, I suggest you look up\nyour squatters' rights before the College find a \"needy person\". They've been i oo king for two\nyears, so they're bound to find one real soon.\nVictor Mooney has a very nice flat near\nSouthside. Recently redecorated I understand.\n\u00a31,000. A number of College employees live in\nNo8 Princes Gardens and others are\nsprinkled around Princes and Evelyn Gardens.\nHowever, a lot seem quite legitimate and will\nwarrant no further attention.\n68 Evelyn Gardens. Interesting little\nnumber. This house contains six flats originally\nintended for married IC students. To the best of\navailable knowledge, only two are occupied by\nstudents. One is home sweet home for Stan,\nthe drunk who used to swear at people in the\nSouthside Bar before he was moved to the\nHolland Club. He was obviously thought to be\nin need by Miss White, who was then Secretary to the \"Accornmodatin Selection\nCommittee\" and a friend. The way of the\nworld, I suppose!\nAgain in 68, one flat had been empty for\nfifteen months. Miss White has denied that the\nflat was empty for this period and the College\neven denied that the flat was empty IN WRITING to Camden Council Housing Aid Centre after a married student couple had\napplied for it, knowing it to be empty. At least\ntwelve people applied for the flat in 1979 by the\ntime it was leased to Mr Chappells, a senior\nengineer in the Estates department, just three\nweeks after Camden Council had requested\ninformation from College. It was leased on the\ngrounds that \"no one else had applied for it\".\nRent \u00a332.20 per week. Not bad for a flat\nsuitable for a married person with children.\nYes sir, College owned flats sure is an\ninteresting topic. Is there anything else that\nsprings to mind while I 've got a pen in my\nhand? Well, what about the latest episode of\npetty back slapping amongst Union hacks\u2014ie\nthe practice of awarding engraved pewter pots\nat the last Union Council of the year. Rae\nSnee wants to put a motion to Council to stop\nthe awarding of pots as it's costing a lot of\nmoney. What another noble thought! Mind\nyou, she's clever enough to realise that while\nJohn Passmore is stupid enough to give her aUG A, even Council wouldn't let her have a pot. Liz Lindsay is up in arms! She wants an\nICU pot to \"complete her set\" and she isn't about to let Rae Snee do her down. Personally,\nI thought a pot was for pissing in!\nFinally, I would like to thank Mark Smith,\nPatrick Coll, Tim Hillyer, Colin Palmer, Phil\nWebb, Andy Dixon, Martin Taylor, Shanne\nWoodhouse, Dave Britton, Dave Jago, Steve\nGoulder, \"Eric\" Jarvis, Pallab Ghosh, Paul\nParker, Caroline Godin, Paul Donovan, Sean\nGi bl in for helping on FELIX this year.

    "content": "Mascotry\nMascotry reared its head this year again.\nThe first term saw Guilds get City University's Carrot and then City return to inadvertently\nsteal John Passmore. It is often claimed that IC\nstudents do not need UL U because they u have all the facilities, clubs and societies\nnecessary in their own College without going\noutside. The same could be said of mascot ry. Due to the unique division of CC Us aspiring\nmascot violators can practice inside their own\nCollege. This happened in March when R CSU violated \" Davey\" the Mines mascot. The mascot was taken to an R CSU GM and Mines\nrepossessed it after an \"ugly scene\", in May,\nR CSU made a second attempt to take \"Davey\", this time unsuccessful. Rich Archer,\nR CSU President was unaware of most of the\nactivities of the mascot ry group, and his\nresignation came as the culmination of a long\nperiod of bitterness.\nRag fortunes this year have fluctuated; a high attendance for the traditional tiddlywinks\nfollowed by lesser numbers for other events.\nThe Rag Chairman was forced to resign, but\nRag Week was enjoyed by everyone who took\npart.\nBoring\nTwo events that most students don't know a lot about were Meet IC and IN COST. Captain\nLindley organised Meet IC and Liz Lindsay,\nIN COST. The College would do well to hire\nher in two years time for the next Meet IC to\nmake it more sucessful. Should the Union\nreciprocate the gesture with its next conference though?\nRachel Snee as Deputy President this year,\nhas to some extent wasted her abilities in often\nunnecessary attacks on FELIX personnel. She\nseems to spend too much time being \"disgusted\" to change that which she has been\ndisgusted about. As for John Passmore, well,\nhis leadership could not be called inspired or\ndynamic. He has frequently faced severe\ncriticism at Union meetings but shrugged it off,\nmuch as he tried to fend off FELIX. It is\nnot thought that a list of the Exec's achievements this year would be very long,\nhowever, credit is due to them for keeping the\nUnion ticking over since last year Council this\nyear has been rather too obsessed with its own\nself-importance to be of much use. Fortunately\nit has not got bogged down in \"political\" issues\nand the discussion of these matters are usually\nbrought to aUG M( if its not in quo rate!). Steve Marshall\nWithout a doubt though, the most con travers i al aspect of the Union this year has\nbeen FELIX.\nSteve Marshall has never let a chance slip to\npoint out the inadequacy and pettiness of\nthose in College administration and in Union\nposts. He has not shied away from defending\nthe concept of editorial freedom, refusing to be\ntold what to do by anyone. His editorial reign\nhas been more concerned with \"quality\" than\n\"quantity\". He seems to hold the Union and its\ninstitutions in not inconsiderable disrespect,\nand there are very few pee ople who can deal\nwith him to their own advantage. Steve\nMarshall's editorial style has so often resulted\nin the newspaper being the news. His campaign against Dare Afolabi whilst being\ndisgraceful was the talking point of many\ngroups for some time. The issue that caused\nthe greatest controversy was at the start of\n1981 and concerned the non-awarding of a knighthood to Mr Mooney. All sections of\nCollege felt strongly about that issue either for\nor against, and strong pressure was put on\nSteve Marshall to apologise to Mr Mooney.\nHowever, he published an article which explained what had happened and this was\naccepted as an apology, by Union Council,\neven though it showed little sign of remorse or\nregret in it.\nThe other major issue which aroused passions were the insulting remarks made by\nSteve Marshall about Princess Anne. This\nresulted in a motion of No Confidence in him\nbeing brought to the Hustings U GM. With his\ncustomary disregard for precedent, he refused\nto speak in his own defence, but instead had a statement read on his behalf (which included\ncriticism of the Exec) in which he offered to\nresign there and then. This was a dramatic\nmove, but the meeting did not si eze the\nopportunity of throwing him out, however.\nIt is very difficult to say what the effect of\nthis year's FELIX has been. It has been\nclaimed that FELIX has made it difficult for the\nUnion to deal with College. I'm sure the people\nin College have more sense than that. FELLX\nhas been very controversial, and this means\nthat most people read it, if only to be shocked\nby bare bottoms and obscenities (for Mr Marshall caters for all tastes). The controversy\nthat so often surrounds FELIX \"hatchet-job\"\ncan too easily be concerned with the style and\nnature of the article, rather than what the\narticle was about. This is a pity. But at least\nSteve Marshall can claim to have published\nwhat the Union really thinks about certain\npeople and institutions, as exemplified by what\nelected representatives are happy to say in\nthe Union Bar, rather than on College committees.\nHandbook Help\nAre you multi-talented and staying in or\naround College for the summer? If so why not\npop into the FELIX office and see what's happening on the IC Union HANDBOOK. Whatever you're into we can use you. If you\nare a literary genius then you are especially\nwelcome as articles on eating-out, going-out,\npub guide etc. etc are needed now. So pull your finger out while you've still got\nthe chance.\nTizard Hall\nAssistant Sub-Wardens\nApplications are invited for two posts of assistant sub-warden which have been created in\nTizard Hall for the academic year 1981/2. Rentfree accommodation in a single room will be\nprovided. Tizard Hall will have approximately\n94 men and 24 women residents and the duties\nof the assistant sub-warden are to help the\nwarden and sub-warden with the day-to-day\norganisation of the Hall and to contribute to its\nsocial life.\nBoth female and male students of Imperial\nCollege are invited to apply and although the\nsuccessful applicants would normally be post-graduates, applications from others will be considered on their merits.\nApplications with a curriculum vitae and names College referees if possible, should be sent to\nDr M HR Hutchinson, Warden, Tizard Hall,\nbefore July 3, 1981.\nEXEC PARTY!\nThursday 25th June, 8:30 J CR, band, bar extension 'til 2 Entrance by Union Card "

    "content": "REVIEW OF THE YEAR Did so little really happen?\nICU's year started with a bang (or a smash)\nwhen thieves broke into the Union Office and\nstole about \u00a35,000 worth of trophies from the\ncabinet. At that time the Union had been\npressing for better locks and an alarm for the\ncabinet, but due to slow moving administration\nin the Estates Dept, headed by Mr D Clark, no\naction had been taken; despite letters from last\nyear's Deputy President, Malcolm Brain. Even\nnow, the cabinet is not locked, but an alarm\nhas been fixed up. It seems unlikely that\nEstates will get round to doing anything about\nthis for some time.\nAnother area where Rae Snee, Deputy President, has crossed swords with Estates\nhas been over Southside security. After\nEstates had assured her that the work of fitting\nnew locking doors in the lower levels would be\ncompleted by early May, it later transpired that\nestimates were still being considered after the\nsupposed date for completion.\nUnion Meetings\nOne area of Union politics which has been ot\nconcern this year, as indeed in most previous\nyears, has been the low attendance at UG Ms. Out of nine meetings held, five were closed\ndue to in quo racy. The Freshers' U GM was\nstopped by Steve Goulder, as was a meeting in\nthe spring term, giving him a reputation as Mr Quorum Caller.\nAt the second meeting, motions on overseas\nstudents and Greek students fees were\npassed, as was a motion on lecturer training.\nThis meeting also passed a motion on limiting to once a term motions on the same\nmatter.\nThe third meeting in the first term was well\nattended and motions were passed affiliating\nC ND and opposing South African sponsored\nstudents on nuclear fuels courses. The meeting also passed a motion criticising Steve\nMarshall's recent satirical attacks on Dare\nAfolabi and others.\nSoon after Christmas came another meeting\u2014one of the worst attended, as many\nstudents didn't know about it, or were doing\nexams. However the meeting passed a motion\non bicycles before closing due to lack of\nbusiness. The next meeting was something of\na mix-up. The date had to be brought forward\nhurriedly, after the FELIX Editor pointed out\nto the Exec that bye-law changes given their\nfirst reading before Christmas would be lost if\nthe next meeting was not held within forty\nCollege days. So the date was changed and the\nturnout disappointingly low. This did not stop\nthe meeting being very heated, as the low\nattendance seemed to be blamed on the Exec,\nsome of whom reacted angrily.\nThe Sabbatical Hustings Meeting came\nnext. This was very well attended and a motion\nof No Confidence in the FELIX Editor was\nproposed which proved very interesting. The\nresults meeting was closed due to in quo racy. In the third term, both meetings were\nstopped but a motion did get passed on the\nUnion's distribution of finances. Thus over the\nyear eight motions were passed.\nThe motion on C ND affiliation caused a stir,\nas there were legal problems over spending\nUnion money on matters outside the Union\nconstitutional powers. The in-phrase at that\ntime for most of the Union was ultra vire s, whilst for FELIX it was e just em generis. This\nlegal principle showed the limited way in which\nthe byelaws would be interpreted if tested in\ncourt, and after many telephone calls and\nletters from the Union to its solicitors, the\ndecision was finally taken not to affiliate to\nC ND. Another motion which was part of a larger\ncampaign by some students in the Union was\nthat involving South African students on nuclear courses here. The College policy is to\nallow this, but some students have picketed\nGoverning Body, organised debates and lobbied the Rector to change this, but without\nany apparent success.\nOne thing to come out of this year's Union\nmeetings were some changes in the Union\nByelaws. The first, to disband I CW A had been\ngoing through \"first readings\" for a few years,\nbut not until this term was I CW A finally\nabolished( subject to Governing Body' s approval).\nIn October. John Passmore, ICU President,\norganised a fresher s' concert with No Dice.\nDue to lack of action on his behalf, the concert\nlost \u00a3500. and John Passmore admitted total\nresponsibility for the flop, and said \"I don't know what I 'll do . . . I think I 'll resign.\"\nMark Clegg, Consoc Chairman and PWP Chairman,\nstrikes an unconventional pose whilst dancing the\nnight away at No 10.\nEdinburgh Award Scheme came in November,\nand this resulted in Mr Mooney being described as a superb caterer in College, and\nCaptain Lindley admitting he didn't know\nexactly what was going on. The visitors the\nnext week were ies s welcome. They abused\nthe Union Office staff and stole John Passmore for a few hours. Fred Sanger,\ndouble Nobel prize winner, came in December,\nand Shirley Williams came in January. She\nreturned later in the year to inaugurate the\nSDP at the College.\nIn February the Navy came to tell us what\nthey do, and Dr Magnus Pyke came to wave\nhis arms about. This month also saw Dr Garry\nHunt, Giles Shaw MP and Raymond Baxter. In\nMarch we had Mark Carlisle MP, Patrick\nMoore, and Ian McGregor. So this year IC has\nhad its fair share of important visitors, but the\nfatal attraction of the College seems elusive to\nthis writer.\nBarney McCabe, ICU Deputy President-elect,\nstresses a point during the election run-up.\nElections this year were fairly uncontroversial. but\ndid produce some unexpected candidates.\nVisitors\nVisitors to College this year have been most\ninteresting. Sir Keith Joseph pointed the way\nin October; Prince Phillip and the Duke of\nHeadbangers? No, a display of Martial Arts in the\nJCR during International Week.\n\n"

    "content": "known College nobodies and hushed whispers\nof excitement circulated as the Baron Flowers\nand his good lady wife arrived on the scene.\nAmidst the heady chit-chat the effervescent\nfirst lady was heard proclaiming how well the\nCollege Wives' stall at the Rag Fete had done.\nAt this point Brian woke up and piped \"so it\nshould have . . . I made the jam.\"\nDon Monro has also been very busy in\nrecent weeks following the controversy of the\nredistribution of women in the Halls of\nResidence. The Senior Warden was rightly\nconcerned that Residence Committee should\nact on an informed basis and quickly prepared\na questionnaire on the topic for distribution in\nthe Halls and Houses. To avoid the possibility\nof one side or the other (for whatever reason)\ncopying the forms and unfairly weighting the\nresults, he set about the task of individually\nstamping the forms with a different number. It\nwas not until he was stamping the very last\nform however, that it was pointed out to him\nthat he was stamping the top half of the form\nabou e the \"tear off and return\" slip.\nQuick as a flash he summoned forth an\nexample of characteristic wit. \" Oh shit!\" he\nsaid, stamping the last form.\nSlwkv a Leg\nI see that somebody has written an article on\nFreemasonry in this issue. What a surprise it\nwas to me (a mere Water Buffalo) that such\nthings actually happen in College! I mean, I can\nhardly imagine any of the top College knobs\nlike Brian and Victor roaming around half\nnaked chanting a load of mum bo jumbo. It\nstrikes me that it might be a bit of fun when\nyou've had a few too many, but do they really\ntake it seriously enough to partake in all this\ncloak and dagger nonsense? Anyway, I know\nfor a fact that the handshake business is\ncompletely wrong, as I once saw a retired\ncaptain and a MacDonalds chef swapping such\nniceties at a party. Here's a friend and I demonstrating the real grip.\nBy B.B. Wolff e Anckm Away\nI was most surprised at all the fuss the editor\nhas been making over this Captain Lindley\nfellow. The last thing I remember hearing\nabout him was that he was rushing around\ntelling Victor Mooney to slap a writ on the\npaper following the New Year's Honours shocker. Reading between the lines on the\nissues that I 've missed, I gained the impression\nthat people aren't too sure of who he is or\nexactly what he does.\nAs Domestic Secretary he's employed to\nensure that everything's ship shape and Bristol\nfashion in the domestic section (which includes\nBookings, Cleaning Services, Messengers and\nRefectories). Some of the staff in Sherfield\nseem to think he's also that white bearded\nchap who advertises fish fingers on the box\n(Captain Birdseye?) but there's not a scrap of\ntruth in the rumour I can tell you!\nHis big thing seems to be \"Meet IC\", the\nCollege'sPR job on the local residents.\nBasically the idea is that we wheel in a few of\nthe geriatrics from the locale, fill 'em up with\nfood and wine, show them a few displays in the\nJ CR and then pray to God that they don't complain when you're blasting Motorhead at\n50 watts per channel from your bedroom and\nurinating on their geraniums! The old salt\nseems a little confused about the whole affair\nthough. He was under the impression that\nabout five hundred people were due to attend\nthe recent do, but only one hundred^ and\nseventeen had actually accepted invitations.\nImagine how the poor exhibitors in the J CR felt after spending many hours preparing their\ndisplays.\nApparently so few people actually turned up\nthat Martin Parsons (Mr Mooney's under-study) was seen wandering around pressing\nwine on any strangers in the vicinity of the\nbuffet. There was so much wine flowing that\neven John Passmore couldn't manage it by\nhimself!\nAnyway, as his title suggests, he is well\nversed in nautical matters and is quite often\nseen trimming his sail and setting off on some\nvital mission or other. When at a party with the\nMews residents once, he was most embarrassed when someone strolled over and said\nloudly \" Why it's Petty Officer Lindley!\" Whether this was a statement of rank or a comment on his attitudes remains uncertain.\nS Uc fey Fwqm\nSenior Warden and well-known socialite\nDon Monro threw a wild beef-steak party at\nthe back of Weeks Hall a few weeks ago. Don\n(Kermit to his friends) invited all the well\nJilted Jpfm\nJohn Passmore's part in the redistribution of\nwomen in Hall saga prompted one wry comment from Don Monro. Knowing John is\nkeen to be a sub warden next year when he\ntakes on a PhD, he quipped \"Well, he can\nforget Beit I suppose!\"\nSubsequently it appears that John has\nactually applied for a sub warden ship, but in\nMining House (more his league I suppose).\nHaving been the greatest ICU President in\nliving memory and knowing most of the\nselection committee, he naturally assumed\nthat he would have a \"good chance\" of getting\nthe job. Imagine my surprise then, when a very\ngood source told me that when interviewed he\nwas considered \"a complete and utter prat\".\nThe job was given to someone else.\nIt came as no surprise to me that someone\nhas at last drawn attention to the similarity\nbetween Captain White and Colonel Lindley\n(see letters page). For some weeks now 1 have\nhad this feeling that a scandal would soon\nbreak in the higher orders. Imagine my horror\nBrian\nNews has reached my ears of the sordid\ngoings-on in the Union Office. On the day of\nthe Derby not only was John (I did it my way)\nPassmore off getting pissed as usual, but\nmatronly administrator Jen Hardy-Smith was\nrunning a book! Well, it was only a sweepstake\nreally, and I gather that \" Nap\" Hardy-Smith\njoyfully set about the task of matching the\nnames of punters to their horses by drawing\nnames written on pieces of paper out of\nalternate hats. When Rae Snee and Christine\nTeller were asked to draw, a peculiar situation\narose when Rae drew Christine Teller's name\nfrom the \"names\" hat. All the bets were that\nChrissy would return the compliment when\nshe drew the horse!\nwhen I discovered that Brian himself is the\nspitting image of Captain Scarlet's sidekick,\nLieutenant Green. If all the top College bod s turn out to be wooden headed marionettes,\nthen who's really in charge? Let's hope that it's not Colonel White!\nLieutenant Green\nWfo pd ht kb b wm i*t College?\n\n"

What move did Blanche\nplay? What should she have played? And how did Wodge deduce that this leads to\nmate in three?

A great deal of hard work had\ngone into the preparations for the conference\nthroughout the year by many students from IC.\nDuring last summer invitations to attend the\nconference were sent to all the major academic\ninstitutions throughout Europe but the response\nwas a bit disheartening. In the end we had 44\nstudents attending the conference including two\ndelegates who were sponsored by UNESCO.\nThese two students came from Malaysia and\nKenya.\nThe students arrived on Wednesday, April 1\nand were settled into their Southside a com moda tion. Unfortunately the heating system was being\naltered so some rooms were not very warm! A welcoming ceremony was held for the delegates\nin the Union that afternoon. We were very\npleased to have Prof Sutton present to welcome\nthe students on behalf of the College. Mr Alan\nGoodyear from UNESCO was also present and\nhe outlined his organisation's connection with the\nprevious conferences.\nWork started on the Thursday with all the\ndelegates split into their chosen working groups.\nThe four topics which were discussed were: the\nInformation Revolution; Transportation in an\nEnergy Conscious Society; Educational Preparation for a Scientific or Technical Degree;\nand, the Role of Research in Universities.\nThe organisers of each group managed to\nattract some very distinguished speakers to\ncontribute to the conferences. These people\nincluded Dr Tony Ridley, Managing Director of\nLondon Transport, Mr Paul Sieghart, a barrister\nconcerned with Privacy Law. Dr John Spice,\nHead of Nuffield Science Foundation and Dr\nWaller of the National Research Development\nCorporation. The general procedure was for our\nstudents to introduce the topic and to guide the\ndelegates into the various international aspects of\nthe subject.\nOr. the Thursday evening the whole party\nheaded into the West End for a visit to the\ntheatre. The show which had been chosen, Euita,\nproved to be a very popular choice and the\nevening was rounded off by a trip through Soho.\nThe working groups met again on Friday\nmorning but in the afternoon the party split up ir.\norder to visit some companies. The visits which\nhad been arranged were to GEC Computers Ltd\nat Dunstable and the Ford Motor Co at\nDagenham. Unfortunately the workers at Ford\nwere on a 'go slow' so the delegates had a shortened visit.\nThe GEC visit was very interesting and was\nwell rounded off with a super afternoon tea! On Saturday work started again but we were without\nour two Polish friends as they are supporters of\n'Solidarity'! In the afternoon several delegates\nwent to see QPR play but I think they were\ndisappointed through the lack of goals. That\nevening we held a dinner for the delegates in\nSouthside. Mr Peter Foster, Deputy Chairman of\nthe Board of Governors, was our guest speaker\nand Mr Alan Goodyear replied on behalf of the\nguests. Prof Sutton also attended the dinner and\neveryone seemed to enjoy the evening. On Sunday the group descended upon Silwood Park\nwhere we were received by Mr Fisher, warden of\nthe park. Following a super lunch at Silwood we\nheaded back to London via Windsor where there\nwas lots of time to visit the castle and have\nafternoon tea! Later that evening we all met in the\nUnion Bar where an international darts competition was held!\nMonday morning was back to work and in the\nafternoon the delegates visited British Telecommunications at Ipswich and the Metal Box\nCompany at Wantage. These were both very interesting visits and were enjoyed by\neveryone.\nOn Tuesday the final reports were put together\nand were discussed by the group as a whole. A lot\nof very interesting information had been compiled\nand was presented in very differing ways. The\nreports of the groups will be produced before the\nend of June. At the final session it was decided\nto hold the Sixth IN COST in Gliwice, Poland next\neaster providing the political situation is relatively\nstable. To end a very enjoyable week a pub crawl\naround the various hostelries in South Kensington was arranged.\nOur European visitors took advantage of the\ncheaper English beer and consumed their fair\nshare!\nOn Wednesday most of our delegates left but\nall promising to attend a get-together in\nTrondheim, Norway in October. After al! the\nhassle of the preparations for the week the\nconference was a tremendous success and was\nenjoyed by all concerned.\nElizabeth Lindsay\nICU Hon Sec\n\n"

    "content": "leg above the knee and right sleeve, a rope\nnoose is hung round his neck and his left\nbreast bared. All metal objects are removed\nfrom his person (see below).\nDuring the initiation he is told the \"secrets\" of Masonry( grips, passwords,\netc) and then he pledges an oath on the\nBible which if he breaks may result in him\nhaving his throat cut, his tongue torn out,\nhis left breast laid open, his body severed in\ntwo and bowels burned to ashes, his head\ncut off, his right hand cut off and slung over\nhis left shoulder to wither and die.\nIt may all sound very silly but it seems to\nbe an adult game worth playing for the\nbenefits it reaps if the number of Freemasons high in the College administration\nstructure is anything to go by.\nIt is of great interest that the Masonic Dinners, which up until early this year were\nheld at the British Masonic Headquarters in\nGreat Queen Street, have now been shifted\nto the refectory in the Sherfield Building.\nThis means that Freemasons from all over\nthe country come to Imperial College to eat!\nIam informed by a Mason who travels\nfour hundred miles to attend these dinners\nthat \"the food is simply excellent and the\nprice is so cheap\". We asked Mr Mooney directly if he was a Mason and he denied any\nsuggestion that he was. However, if he were\na Mason he would be under oath not to\ndivulge the fact to us. It is a well-known fact\nthat Mr Mooney often books dinners in the\nSherfield Building under the name of \" The White Lodge Golf Club\". Mr Mooney does\nnot play golf (see FELIX interview No.569) and the aforementioned golf club is in\nfact a Masonic Lodge. If Mr Mooney is not already a Freemason, then perhaps he\nwould like to be. For the Grand Lodge to\nchoose Imperial College in which to dine I can only think that they are getting a very\ngood deal indeed.\nMany top officials in the Sherfield Building\nare Freemasons. They mostly belong to the\nHammersmith Arts and Sciences Lodge.\n(This is curious since dinners are booked under the Golf Club \u2014 surely someone in\nCollege belongs to f his Lodge?)\nThe \"College Lodge\" is quite active. It\nholds regular meetings in its Temple \u2014 the Quiet Room in the basement of the Sherfield Building. It is quite possible to\ncatch glimpses of well known College figures in Masonic regalia if you wander out\nof the Sherfield ground level toilets back\nentrance down to the Quiet Room. If you're\nvery lucky, you might even catch a glimpse\nof an initiate ( 4 0 0 AS A film, avoid flash and send immediately to FELIX for hefty payment!)\nNot so long ago, the Islamic Society were\nprevented from utilising the Quiet Room as\na prayer room! Rumours abound of a Masonic influence but I'm quite convinced\nthey have no factual basis.\nIncidentally, the two cleaners' cupboards\nnear the Quiet Room( which the cleaners\ndon't have a key to) are used for storing\nMasonic regalia. And next to the Quiet\nRoom is a snooker room which is undoubtedly put to good use on a Lodge night.\nSo what does it all mean. What's wrong with the College dign i tories dressing up and playing in an undignified manner, having a few beers and a few smokes in the snooker\nroom. Absolutely nothing! But is that all\nthere is to it? Let me conclude by asking a couple of questions:\nHow can Imperial College catering be\nrecognised by representatives of over half a million British Freemasons as the best deal\nin terms of quality and price of food, even\nbetter than the catering it can provide itself\nat the Great Queen Street headquarters?\nWhich people in College administration\nare holding posts purely and simply because they are Freemasons and not on\nany proven ability?\nSources of Reference:\nDarkness Visible by Walton Hannah Freemasonry Exposed and Explained by\nWilliam Morgan(1826).( Publication of this\nbook led to its author's murder.) Has been\nreprinted.\nWhy Shouldn't1 Be A Freemason by\nWalton Hannah There are many Masonic texts supposedly\nunderstood only by Freemasons \u2014 a list and\nlonger list of general references is given in\nDarkness Visible.\n\n"

    "content": "Women in Hall:\nthe Final Word\nThe Rector has recently received a petition from a number of students\narguing that the proposals agreed by the Students Residence Committee concerning the redistribution of women's places in Halls\nare contrary to the best interests of women at Imperial College.\nAfter consultation with the S RC the Rector is satisfied that the well being of women students has been carefully considered. The changes\nproposed for next session simply represent the next step in the policy\nwhich has been evolved over many years to increase the number of\nmixed residences in the College and to increase the number of places\nfor women as their overall numbers increase, this year including the\nprovision of an additional sixteen places in Hall for women students.\nThe achievement of a satisfactory balance is difficult and will remain\nso until there is a substantial increase in the number of women students\noverall, but it has always been seen that there must be a reasonable\npercentage representation of women in any mixed hall. New mixed\nhalls have been introduced, in the past and as proposed now, by first\nincreasing the number of places allocated to women in existing mixed\nhalls and then transferring a block of these places to an all-male hall.\nThe proposals now made will result in the following changes:\nBE IT HALL: Decrease in women's places from 46 to 28 and an equivalent increase of 18 places for men.\nSELKIRK HALL: Decrease in women's places from 30 to 24 and an\nequivalent increase of 6 places for men.\nTI ZARD HALL: To become mixed with 24 women's places and 96\nmen's places.\nWEEKS HALL: To become mixed with 16 women's places and 50\nmen's places.\nThere will be no other changes.\nHaving made the decision that Ti zard and Weeks Halls should be\nmixed it would be inappropriate, as the petitioners must realise, to\nprovide only two or three women's places in each and so quotas in multiples of eight have been agreed. Over the next few years the\nnumber of women's places will continue to be increased until it is\npossible for further residences to become mixed. Beit Hall, from which\nmost protests about the proposed redistribution have come, will still\nhave 28 women's places to 87 men's places.\nSeats\nPinched\nOVER THE PAST four months,\nsixty-live chairs have disappeared\nfrom the Union Lower Refectory.\nIt is suspected that some have\nbeen distributed around the Union, but the main line of thinking seems to be that Beit\nresidents have nicked them. However, when FELIX asked a Beit resident about this allegation,\nhe told us that there wasn't enough room in a Beit room lor\nextra furniture, and that there\nwere two chairs already. Mr Reeves (Chief Security Officer)\nwould appreciate it if the chairs\ncould be returned as soon as\npossible, otherwise a search will\nhave to be carried out.\nSmall Ads\n\u2022Hack of the Year\u2014Stephen Goulder.\n\u2022Foldable bicycle, nearly new, VG C, \u00a3 4 5 .

One call was for a \"suspected\ndeceased\" at Shepherds Bush Green. The ambulance arrived\nto find the \" dead\" man \"dead\ndrunk\". He was taken to hospital\nfor a check up and then by police\nvan to \"recover\" in the cells of\nShepherds Bush Police Station.\nThanks to all the IC Red Cross\nDetachment members who gave\nup their time to cover this\nemergency was expressed by the\nEmergency Coordinator at Scotland Yard.

These have recently been\nfound in documents at the Public\nRecords Office.\nReports included a list of all\nRussian cities with a population\nof more than100,000 within bombing range of British bases.\nA total of fifty-eight target\ncities making up17.5% of the\nSoviet Union's urban population\nlay within range of the bases.\nThe committee concluded that\nthe most profitable objects of\nattack by the new weapons will\nnormally be concentrations of\npopulation, centres of distribution and communication.

    "content": "A Considered Opinion\nThe role of the Rector\nin College life\nIt is difficult, if not impossible to disentangle the role of the\nRector as a position with the person who holds that post at a given time. It is a commonplace, but nevertheless true, to say\nthat effectively the way the job is done is an interaction of these\ntwo aspects. However, Is hall endeavour to examine in a little\nmore detail how this interaction works.\nThe post of Rector is that of head of the College; all aspects of\nthis College. He is thus head of the academic staff, head of the\ntechnical stall, and head of the administrative staff. As such he is\nsubject to enormous pressures from each section of the College. The pressures, which normally have the distribution of resources at their base, can take a wide variety of forms. For example appointments of new lecturers from departments have\nto be balanced by the administration's unquenchable thirst for\nnew administrators. I could go further into the competition for\nresources from various committees but to do this would make this essay more tedious than is necessary. This all means, of\ncourse, that the Rector has to be a genius in order to keep\neverybody happy; the result is that most people, whoever happens to be the Rector, are always moderately unhappy. The other main function of the Rector is to represent the College not\nonly to the university, but also to the world at large. Here again he comes under pressure from below especially in the administration block in that he has to defend, in public at least,\nthe acts which have been perpetrated by his subordinates, often\nwithout his knowledge. Thus whether it be a cover up concerning a student's suicide or the wastage of money on\nuseless public relations exercises, or the attitude towards a group of students belonging to a minority society, or the\ndeparture of a prestigious group of academics lor another university, the decisions have been made collectively at a lower level and cannot, without great risk, be altered.\nThis present Rector came to the post from the S RC and has\nattempted to apply to this College the policies which he\nfollowed at the council namely the establishing of \" centres of\nexcellence\". He does not like small institutions viz his numerous attempts to close down or amalgamate the department of\naeronautics and rumours( the truth of which I have been unable to verify) to split upR SM into the other two colleges. His ideas\nof centres of excellence( eg here, UMIST, Her stm once ux, Cambridge, etc) while possibly valid for the short term, in the long run will lead to a decline of original research because small institutions have been deprived of money. This means that\nwhen the modes of thought inherent in the centres ol excellence\nhave been exhausted there will be no original scientists in other places to fill the gaps.\nSmall is indeed beautiful, and efficient, where creative processes are involved. But with a Rector who cannot control the administration and indeed, with its central ising aims, appears\nto be in sympathy with it, such a dream will have to remain a dream until the leading position of British science in the world has been eroded.
