    "content": "FELIX\nTRIAL BY JURY\nGilbert and Sullivan is a standard choice\nfor the Musical Society and can be, at its\nbest, most entertaining, if a bit archaic. It\nwas interesting to see the Producer, Mr. Peter\nRodway, had got away from the D 'Oyly\nCarte prompt book to some extent, though\nit is debatable whether increasing the number of people on an already crowded stage\nis a step in th\u00a9 right direction. We were, of\ncourse, subjected to the male chorus in line\nabreast on the apron of the stage, but apart\nfrom purely personal dislikes, the whole production was treated in exactly the spirit and\nthe overall effect was a very entertaining per-form ance. Once again the Wagnerian approach crept in\nto some extent, particularly with the leading\nsoprano, but most of the time lead roles were\nperformed and sung in very much the right\nmanner, although there were times when humorous byplay detracted somewhat from the\nmain action. The orchestra seemed very much\nmore at home with Sullivan's music and per-If. Karnac\n(books) Ltd.\nNEW BOOKS\nSECONDHAND BOOKS\nand now . . PAPERBACKS Visit our new paperbacks shop at 56,\nGloucester Road, where a comprehensive\nselection of general technical and\nscientific paperbacks are on display.\nGloucester Road,\nS.W.7 formed most creditably, although the timpani\nand strings were occasionally overpowering.\nThe set suffered once more from over filling the stage and the painting of it appeared a little bizarre. The lighting, designed presumably to tone with the colouring of the set,\nwas also rather unusual, but, in the backdrop effect, did succeed in being most effect-ive. The most notable performances were\nthose of Maciej Smolenski as the Usher, Neil\nMurray as Counsel for the Plaintiff and Dave\nRymer as the mcfc t Learned Judge. These\nthree carried the piece along with spirit and\ngreat humour and were ably supported by the\nremainder of the cast. The Public and the\nJurymen, although there seemed to be an awful lot of them on the stage at once, entered\nfully into the general entertainment of the\nproduction. Mention should also be made of\na charming performance in the interval by\nthe stage crew, much appreciated by some\nsections of the audience at least.\nBASTIEN\nand BASTIENNE\nThis opera, written by Mozart at the age\nof 12, must essentially be performed in a very\nlight manner. The orchestra's tendency to plod\non some passages, and the somewhat Wagnerian interpretation of soprano, did not help\nthis conception. The tenor voice seemed more\nsuited to the mood of the piece t, but was\nunfortunate ll y, often inaudible, and, although\nthe character is ation seemed correctly orient-a ted, the result was not entirely successful.\nThe part of the Magician, Colas was effectively sung and performed, but with a regret-ably tendency towards pan to mine demon\nking, without the correct costume. The hat\ngave a faultless performance; but the costumes\nin general \" \u2014 entirely unsuited to the piece.\nThe set, though well and robustly constructed,\nwith a particularly impressive tree, appeared\nto clutter the stage to such an! extent as\nto leave no room for the performers. It looked\npleasantly rustic and was very well lit, but\nthere was just too much of it.\nFILM\nTHE THRONE OF BLOOD7 p.m. Fri. March 2nd Concert Hall.\nIn THE THRONE OF BLOOD Kurosaura has\ntaken the plot of Macbeth and used it in a Japanese setting. It is inevitable to compare\nthis film with Shakespeare's Macbeth since\nKurosaura has been so faithful in his interpretation \u2014 Dashizu (the counterpart of Macbeth) murders Tsuzuki (Duncan), Asaji (Lady\nMacbeth) tries to wash the blood off her hands\n\u2014 yet at the same time it is no imitation;\nrather have both Sheakespeare and Kurosaura\nused the original in Holinshed. In the 16th century Japan was in the turmoil of civil wars\nwith continuous feuding between the war\nlords. It is this period that Kurosaura has\nused convincingly for his tale. Without the\npoetry of Shakespeare, the crudity, treachery\nand violence are more obvious and the result\nsometimes hysteria. This is emphasised b v Lord Washizu's death \u2014 a barbaric act in\nwhich he becomes pincushion ed with arrows\nuntil he is almost split apart. The acting is\ndifferent but good. Kurosoura has used many\nof these actors before and like Bergman and\nFord prefers to keep his cast together. The\ntradition of the no play has produced its own\nstyle of acting in which a motions are shown\nwith the eyes and body whilst retaining an\nexpressionless face. Japan has a prolific film\nindustry making more feature films than an v other country (1958, Japan 516, America 288)\nyet only Akira Kurosaura's films have consistently appealed to the western eyes. His\nability can be assessed from his films:\nRASHOMON, SEVEN SUMARAI, THE HIDDEN\nFORTRESS,and I would place THRONE OF BLOOD\nsecond after SEVEN SUMARAI.\nA J. WALKER DRAMA\nWILLESDEN DRAMA FESTIVAL Having won the U.L. U. competition with\nan extract from \"A Sleep of Prisoners\" by\nChristopher Fry, John Webb chose, the latter\npart of the same play as the I. GD.S entry\nfor the Willesden Drama Festival in the hope\nof emulating that success.\nOnce again the hg h ting and sound effects\nhelp the cast considerably. The set was extremely simple and effective. The two lecterns\nin the church (used by the prisoners of war\nas a billet) aided the grouping of the actors.\nThe main part of the extract consisted of\na dream about the burning of Shadrac, Meshac\nand Abendego in the furnace; the characters\nwere represented by the corporal and the two\nprivates (Mike Combs, Ed Ffield) who played\nthe scene in a shaft of red light. Meadows\n(David Cain) provided the link connecting\ndream and reality, but it was the forceful portrayal of the corporal by Tony Forey that highlighted the production.\nThe Festival ends on March 6th; this production should come high up in the final\nchoice of the Adjudicator.\nThe Dramatic Society are presenting\n\"Arsenic and Old Lace\" on March 13th to\n16th inclusive; it is hoped that you will enjoy\nthis production . . . when you come . . .\nBRYAN HOOPER\n\n"

    "content": "\u2014 6 FELIX\nWhy\nClimb mountains\nTwo weeks ago the I.C. mountaineering\nclub set off to Snowdonia to answer the question once again \u2014 \"because they are there\".\nOf the party of 19, 12 went in the Dormobile\nand the remaining 7 in two estate cars.\nScheduled to leave around 6.30 p.m., it was\nnearly an hour later when with all the gear\nloaded we departed (the time had been well\nspent \"practicing\" on the Union arch until\nthe warden stepped in). \"Bobs\" was reached\nin good time and several plates of sausage,\neggs and* chips were consumed; the plebs eat\nother delicacies.\nOn rl.e outskirts of Shrewsbury it was decided we needed more petrol, so in we drove\nto find a garage; Oh, what fun!!! Anyone\nwho is contemplating a trip there in the near\nfuture) can obtain composite travelling instructions free of charge. The result of our\ntrip was several precious pints of petrol lost,\nand almost an hour wasted. Our last stop\nwas an A. A. box, with no success, so after\na short \"ceremony\" we drove off.\nAt 40 miles from our destination the petrol gauge showed empty, and continued to\ndo so until we ground to a halt at 5 miles\nshort. Half a gallon, originally for the Primus\nwas poured in the tank and off we went a gain. This took us to almost the top of the\nLlanberis pass, so after a \"short\" push we\nfree-wheeled down. After unloading, the party\nsplit into '?them as were\" and \"them as were\nnot\". The latter went to the climbing hut,\nand the former pitched camp.\nThe following morning the trials and tribulations of the night before seemed well worth\nit. For the Llanberies Pass being the most\nfor biding of all in North Wales makes the\nscenery majestic; the cliffs of Snowdon were\nsnow capped and sombre, while the ot ner side of the vall ley was bathed in sunlight.\nBreakfast over it seemed a good idea to obtain some petrol for the Dormobile. We freewheeled until we ran out of \"slope\" and were\nthen towed to the nearest habitation by a milk-float. A brief telephone con ves ration with\nthe nearest garage in Llanberis left no option but to hitch-hike to pick-up some petrol.\nA member of H.M. Forces did the nec es sar v and after a dice with death the machine was\ndr iv able. On returning to camp we found that most\nof the party had already set-off on the various\nclimbs (one notable exception was \"man\nmountain\" who had been waiting for the Dormobile to cornel back, he was \"rather upset\".\nThe standard of climbing in the Club at the\nmoment is of high-standard and the* cliffs of\nLlanberis make a good training ground, there\nbeing a full range from difficult to extreme\nEach man knows his own standard, and\nuntil he knows he has improved, keeps to it.\nConditions varied; on the sunlit side the\nwind made things a little tricky, whereas\nsnow and ice made climbing on the other\nside hard work. Saturday evening was spent\nat the P.Y. G., and after several pints and the\ninevitable discussion of deeds done and deeds\nto come we retired to bed.\nSunday thanks to good wheat her, gave us\nplenty of climbing. In the early evening we\nloaded up and set-off back to London. Normally such a report as this finishes up with\nIi. JLAli fo.y3... and they returned back in the early hours\non Monday, after an uneventful ride.\" However, with a few miles gone a rattle-ing was\nfound to be the exhaust pipe which had\nbroken loose; Welsh wire solved that pro b lem. Just outside Llangollen we were witness\nto a car accident and to crown it all our\ndriver (known to the Staffordshire Police as\nDr. Dobson) was booked for speeding. We\ndid arrive in the early hours though.\nThis year seems to have become one for\nproposed changes. Fortunately most of the\nproposals have been flatly rejected by the\nreactionaries that Mr. Lyle criticises. It seems\nto have been forgotten that before a change\nis adopted the two questions, 'fls there anything wrong now!\" and \"Does this change\nprovide a remedy!\" must be answered affirm at iv aly. Usually the answer to the former question\nis assumed and that to the latter ignored.\nOf course, ifl anybody looks hard enough\nthey can always find something wrong with\nany system. It seems a pity that this year's top men spend too much time looking for\nsmall wrongs while a greater one is being\ncreated. The time that the President and the\nSecretary spend in the Union Building is very\nsmall. They can hardly even be available for\na chat over a few beers, which is a method\nadopted by some of the more approachable\npast Presidents.\nWhen its disadvantages have been pointed\nout there is \u00ab ^ defence forthcoming. They\nhave no arguments in favour and have ignored the possibilities of arguments against.\nSince the proposal for a Deputy President\nhas already been brought up in this paper\nit seems fit to mention it here. \"There is too\nmuch at the top; we need someone who can\nC.&G. MOTOR CLUB DINNER The annual dinner of the motor club was\nthis year noteworthy for being the best attended in the history of he club. This was\npartly accounted for by the large number of\ngue fct s present, the ladies obviously finding\nmotoring a necessary evil of their male\ncompanions. It is possible that the attendance\nwas in some way representative of the strength\nof the club, being probably the largest in\nGuilds with a membership of over 130.\nThe guest speaker was John Bolster, technical editor of Autosport and a man with a wealth of driving experience. Dressed for the\noccasion in a deer-stalker and a Sherlock\nHolmes overcoat he found driving Bo from\nthe 'Rose' in Fulham Road to the Union more\nthan a match for his skill. The Rose is incidentally worthy of Felix Pub Guide, as many\nmotoring enthusiasts meet there to discuss\ntheir weird machinery over a pint.\nReplying on behalf of the guests to the\npresident's introduction, Mr. Bolster told\nsomething of his experience in motor racing,\nmainly in connection with 'Bloody Mary' a 'special' which was conceived while still a schoolboy, but which raced successfully until post war years despite its vintage origin.\nHis career as a racing driver, he said culminated with an unfortunate accident in which\nhe broke his neck.\nIt was disclosed during the course of the\nspeeches that the president of the club, Mr Moore, was leaving the College for five years\nto become Professor of Mechanical Engineering at New Delhi University. This is indeed\na great loss for the club as Mr. Moore has\nbeen president for the past sixteen years and\nit is on lv due to his lead r ship that the club\nhas attained its present popularity.\nAfter the dinner, conversation continued in\nthe senior common room giving opportunity\nto talk to the people on the inside of the\nmotor industry, such as Leonard Rootes of\nSinger cars and to the guests from the racing side of motoring.\ntake over from the President should he for\nsome reason become incapacitated.\" Thus, goes\nthe argument. I think it would be a good idea\nto have one man whose duty it was to be\ndeputy president thus saving undue work for\nthe Vice-Presidents who have enough to do.\nHowever, is the basic premise of the argument correct? Is there really too much work\nfor these people 0?res. Sec. & Clerk). I have\nit on good authority that the Clark has never\nhad a lazier year than this, and in the years\nwhen the Clerk has been hard worked there\nhas bee jn little, for the Secretary to do. It\nseems that two people's work has already\nbeen spread over three, and I think it unnecessary to increase this to four. To cover the\nsecond point of the argument all that is necessary to change the name of the Hon. See's post to that of Deputy President, which, in\neffect, is what ha is already.\nUnder this scheme the Clerk would still\ndo the secretarial work and would once again\nbe fully employed. The President and Secretary could share the committee.work between\nthem instead of duplicating their work, as 'it\npresent. In fact, little would change except\nthat there would be no doubts as to the person\nto represent the President in his absence. The\nscheme has the advantage of being simple and\neffective.\nAll Change\n\n"

Still, it was a good send-off and we\nwish Si and Mrs. Si every happiness.\nIt see ims to have been a busy week-end\none way or the other.

Perhaps, the v think that if they stock enough glasses to sell\nout of be br this is enough. But I was thoroughly fed-up with trying to explain to\ndrinkers wh v they could not have a pint, and\nno doubt Howard and Arthur are completely\ncho cker.

Please read them, Si, and try to base\nsome of your actions on their experience.\nThey re-ally did know this Union and its\nstudents, and neither changes very much.\nTOUCHSTONE WEEKEND THE VERY DEVIL\nThe last Touchstone! Weekend held at Silwood Park on February 10th11 th was on\n\"The Very Devil\" \u2014 The Problem of Evil,\nand was introduced by the Rev. Charles\nDavey. The number present was not large,\npossibly because people were f rig hj ten ed either\nof the sub je j or of being addressed by a clergyman. In fact it was a fascinating topic,\naffording unlimited scope for discussion and\nargument, and nobody could object to the\nexcellent manner in which it was presented.\nWhile it is a pity that so few take advantage\nof the opportunities given them, it must be\nadmitted that smaller number do make for\na more intimate and enjoyable weekend, and\na better discussion.\nSome of the main questions arising were:\nWhat do we mean by Evil? It is perhaps a power of Bad as 'God' is a power of Good?\nWhat constitutes a bad or evil act, and can\nwe produce a generally acceptable definition,\nor some from o(P absolute standard? Also,\nwhat and why is a feeling of guilt? If it is\nthe consequence of an uneasy conscience, then\nwhat is conscience and why does it work so\ndifferently for different people?\nConsideration of these points led to the\nconclusion that, evil was a personal thing.\nthough precisely what we mean by 'personal'\nwas another problem. Essentially a third party\nwas involved, and furthermore a knowledge\nof right and wrong and a conscious misdeed\nseemed to be implied. In attempting to find\nan absolute standard of morality, 'Do as you\nwould be done by\" was generally accepted as\na basic criterion, but an v attempt to go beyond this produced a rift between Christian\nand atheistic fan ct ions present. This controversy, rapidly broadened into the per ent i al is suet 'Why believe in God', which was pro-prolonged to the early (or in some cases, not\nso early) hours of Sunday morning, and subsequently confirmed, but not concluded. Of\ncourse neither side con v in carl the other, but\nit was good fun, and by no means useless\nTouchstone weekends are not devoted entirely to serious discussions, and Sunday morning was completely free, so with weather\nnearly perfect for the time of year, Windsor\nPark was a popular venue for many of us.\nwhile others made up lost sleep, or relaxed\nwith the Sunday newspapers.

The Union\nGeneral Award has no popular appeal and\ncertain extra College Clubs award their own\nseal of favour by conferring membership on\nselected individuals who meet their specifications by being of a certain type.\nThere is, therefore, no way in which we\ncan recognise the efforts of those who have\ngiven service to the Union but don't belong\nto any clique or grouping within it.\nThe esl abi is hn ent of af' a'ern it y or society\nfor which people become eligible as the result of service, of a sufficient level, to the\nUnion is a basic necessity in this College.\nWhat is a sufficient level of service is difficult\nto define but surely it can be resolved so as to\nbe acceptable to the majority and not to pander to the limited sense or values of a small,\nbut influential, section of our Union.\nYours faithfully,\nWILLIAM P.

This is what the writer has set\nout to do.\nThe Government has decided, quite arb it ari ly, that it would be a grand idea to pour\nmillions of pounds into technical colleges. As\nI.C. is the closest to Westminster it was the\nobvious choice for the largest share to be\ngiven.\nThis share takes the form of some \u00a320 million or more. The College authorities, poor\nbenighted technologists that they were, were\nnaturally bewildered by this vast sum. They\nlooked around and compared the \"amenities\"\noffered by this College with those offered by\nOxbridge and saw one glaring omission:\nHalls of Residence.\nIt was also noted that the products of Oxbridge got on in the world, becoming Prime\nMinisters, Managing Directors, Stockbrokers\nand successful tax dodgers. Whereas the ex-I.C. students became simple engineers, scientists and hole diggers.\nIt was obvious, putting these facts together,\nthat residence in a Halls of Residence while\nat Collge is the key to success in the after\nlife. Thus, we have the reason for the building of the Halls of Residence.\nNow for the excuse.\nA student living in close proximity to his\nfellow students, of all classes, nationalities,\nideas and ideals will naturally take part in\ndiscussions about the world situation, re lig ion, ethics, politics, philosophy and the latest\nplight of Jayne Mansfield and also broaden\nhis outlook and learn to live with his fellow\ncreatures.'\nIt will also be easier to a Union spirit if\na large number of students all live close and\ntogether.\nIn fact the actual results are that the average person ignores everyone with a different\noutlook and background and spends his tim t drinking coffee until 3 a.m. to the detriment\nof his de grc~ his attendance at morning\nlectures. Either that, or getting drunk in the\nbar -and returning home bending lamp-posts,\nmaking unholy noise, being sick on the stairs\nand pouring beer and water over those sensible enough to go to bed early but who left\ntheir doors unlocked. There are of course\nthose who are considerate enough to s pena the night in the nick.\nPresent conditions show that the ideal\npicture painted above will never come into\nexistence.\nThe other idea, that students in Halls of\nResidence will take more interest in Union\naffairs, is also false because the only people\nwho can get into Halls of Residence (after\nthe 1st year) are those who take an interest\nin the Union activities.\nWhy can't the authority face the simple\nfacts, which are self evident. Interest in Union,\nacademic societies and clubs, general studies\nand so on is very small and will stay that\nway.\nThe average student here is far more interested in his work than all these hearty \"Let's play at politicians\" games or becoming a pseudo intellectual so he can talk rubbish\nabout anything.\nOne is far better off trying to master his\nsubject, be it engineering or action painting\n(riding bicycles over canvas). Rather than\ntrying to become a good citizen just because\nit is expected of one.\nPlease let us have less nonsense about\nspending thousands of pounds on Halls of Residence but let us have more money for lab-oratories, research or scientific libraries for\nthe true students of this College.\n\n"

Taking over 37 seconds behind\nthe Leeds University man he proceeded to\nnarrow the gap to 15 seconds at the half way\nmark and then finally to take the lead only\nhalf a mile from the finish. Incidentally at the\nsame place at which we lost the lead last\nyear.\nEighty runners, another record entry, lined\nup for the first lap of the 3 mile course encircling the Serpentine. Birmingham led the\nway but were soon overhauled by Edinburgh\nwho retained the lead to the first takeover.\nPete Roy running the first lap for I.C, had a steady race and handed over to fresher Jo\nFitzshnmons. Jo ran well against stiff opposition to hand over in the tenth position.\nEdinburgh increased their lead over Birmingham, but T. Briault, running for St. John's Camb., brought his team through the field\nfrom 43rd place to hand over the 3rd position.\nIn doing so he broke the course record with\na time of 13 m.57s. John Young, running\n3rd for the College, brought us up steadily\nto finish in 6th position. At this stage Edinburgh were still leading, but Leeds University with a good effort by T. Totton, were\nin second place. The fourth lap saw a dramatic change in the lead; Geoff Wood, the\nLeeds runner, took first position just after\nHyde Park Corner and had opened up a200 yd. gap by the finish: Nottingham University had moved to second place. John\nCollins, his 7th time competing and surely\nthe veteran of the I.C. team, brought us up\nto 4th place, less than a minute behind the\nleaders. He handed over to Ted Wilkins who\noverhauled the Nottingham runner at the half\nway stage to take second place.\nThen came John j Cleat or' s fantastic last\nlap and a thrilling victory for the College,\nwith a new course record of 88m.31s.

    "content": "FELIX 3\nINTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATING COMPETITION Guiids win a gal The Intercollegiate Debating Competition\nfor the Imperial College Debating Challenge\nTrophy was won by Guilds again this year.\nGuilds beat RCS by 279 to 256 points and\nalso beat RS M(303219). The first debate was on the motion \"This\nhouse believes that Americans worship false\ngods.\" The RCS team of Christine Bradford,\nJon Bareford, Bob Finch and Finlav Macpherson proposed the motion, while Si Lyle, Srinivasani, John Simpson and Asit Chandmal opposed it for Guilds. In her opening speech,\nChristine Bareford failed to really attack\nAmerican gods, and she had ate nden cv to be facetious, usually fatal in a serious de-bate. She also read a great deal of her speech,\nas did Simpson and Bareford, and this too\nis fatal especially in a com pdt it ion. Si Lyle,\nwho started by saying that he had great pleasure in at last doing something for his constituent College, spoke well but rather slowly and spp eared to tail off suddenly when 8\nminutes were up. Srinivasan has the potentiality of a good debater, and he spoke well.\nThe only criticism of his speech was that he\nhalt e kl notice bly between each of the points\nhe was making, instead of leading smoothly\nfrom one point to the next.\nThe last three speakers were the experienced\ntrio of Bob Finch, Asit Chandmal and Finlay\nMacpherson. Finch spoke in his usual manner,\nbut unfortunately he too tended to be face\ntio us, did not bother to refute any of the\npoints of the opposition. His speech seemed\nto suffer from a lack of adequate preparation.\nSo, as the judges said, it was only the last\nFELIX INVESTIGATIONS INC.\nUNDERCOVER WEDDING EXPOSED I.C. PRESIDENT\nINEXTRICABLY INVOLVED IN MARRIAGE. two speakers who really got their teeth into\nthe motion. Asit Chandmal, summing up for\nthe opposition, made a very good and witty\nspeech CManroe and Mansfield merely represent the excess sugar of a diabetic decade') and\nhe very successfully ridiculed and refuted the\nproposer s' arguments. Perhaps, the one fault\nin his summing up was that he spent a little\ntoo much time tearing up his opponents' arguments and not enough summing up his own\nside's. McPherson made a brilliant speech.\nAt one point it looked as if he would swing\nthe vote, but it was impossible to make-up for\nthe inadequacies of his side. Perhaps, two\ncharges could be levelled against McPherson,\nwrong order of speaking of the team and neglecting the possibility of including an American or Canadian to replace one of the first\ntwo speakers. These tactical mistakes do not\ndetract fro m his extremely good summing up,\nbut at the same time, probably lost RCS the\ndebate. \\\nThe second debate, in which Guilds proposed the motion that \"This House fears the\nfuture\", was practically a walk-over for\nGuilds. Each of their speakers was better than\nhis opposite number and Guilds were\nfar better organised. Lyle proposing, spoke\nof the dangers of 'getting soft' in the Affluent\nSociety, and the very real dangers of the\n'misuse of the Machine Age'. He quoted from\nam article by Prof. Minsky of NOT, and in general convinced the audience that machines were\nteri ble ogres with fiendish designs on hum-an it y. Lyle's speech was excellent. Simpson,\nspeaking second, spoke of the dangers of nuclear war and of nuclear arms spreading over\nthe world. Srinivasan, speaking third for\nGuilds, spoke of the dangers of over pop ul at ion. He said that this was an extremely urgent and almost insurmountable problem,\nwhich birth control alone could not hope to\nsolve. 'Using contraceptives is like eating ac iio co late with the wrapper on, or taking a bath with gum boots on, and in any case, the\nonly certain method of preventing conception\nis a glass of water, taken not before or after,\nbut instead of.' The Mines team were rather\nbadly organised, did not put up many arguments, and with little evi dance. This may have\nbeen due to the fact that they thought their\nfirst speaker would be asked to sum up, instead of their fourth speaker. The speaking\non the Mines side was good on the whole\nand their first speaker certainly has the potentialities of a first rate debater. Asit Chandmal, summing up for Guilds started his\nspeech nervously but soon warmed up to his\naccustomed easy wit ('Hope always goes\nhand-irt th and with ;, iu th, but in the case of\nthe members of the vp yo s it ion this hand-hold-ing has reached the climax of a passionate\nembrace').\nOn the whole, these two debates were extremely enjoyable. The President of Debates\nis to be commanded on his handling of the\nDebates, and his method of arranging the hall\nsimilar to the U.L. U. Debating Hall in an\nimprovement. In his summing he aptly said\nthat f the Debating Competition had been won\nby the New Delhi branch of the Old Centralians'. The Judges, Wilson, Tomlinson and\nWeale performed their hard task in an admirable manner and deserve all the thanks\nand gratitude of the Debating Society.\nSCRUTINY\nThe latest issue of Scrutiny is a considerable improvement on the last one, which\ndisplayed an almost neurotically ag gre sive attitude towards Council and the Union Establishment. In his issue, however, the Union\nand its officers get away with practically no\ncriticism, and one wonders whether Scrutiny\nhas not become part of the Establishment\nafter all. The departure of John Cox from\nthe College must have left a considerable gap\ngap in the ranks of the anti-Union brigade\nand the Editor may have come under the influence of our President's powerful personality during his visit to the Union Office.\nStirring apart, this issue has many commendable fe aure s. \"College Social Affairs\"\nhas some relevant and well-judged observations to make, and the identity of the commentators is at least hinted at by their init-i als. An interesting euphemism occ uns on\npage 5, where unruly behaviour disrupting\nlectures is termed \"somewhat eccentric\"\n'Juvenile\" or\"Offensive\" might be better ad-j ect ives. Bob Finch counterbalances John Cox's pro-Communist article in the last issue with\na more critical approach to the same subject,\nand Mr. Levitt delivers a concentrated and\neffective broadside against Mr. Kubba's anti-Israeli article in particular and the Arab\nLeague in general. Mr. Kubba is cut down\nto size even further by what is perhaps the\nbest article in this issue, Mr. Sekey's \"The\nPatern of Propaganda\". Levitt and Sekey\nhave contributed the sort of articles that justify Scrutiny's existance, for one can't help\nfeeling that in the case of several of the pol-it ical religious articles, the subject is covered\nfar better elsewhere.\nHowever, the Editor and his staff are to be\ncongratulated on the issue, which goes towards filling a gap in the range of student\npublication available. Next issue, per hap is. we may return to the critical attitude of th2 previous issue combined with the factual approach of this one. How about a searching\nand factual article tearing Felix to pieces,\nMr. Pearson?\nGILBERT\nLAMLEY'S TECHNICAL& GENERAL BOOKS\nART MATERIALS DRAWING INSTRUMENTS STATIONERY PAPERBACKS1,3&5 EXHIBITION ROAD, SW.7.

    "content": "- 8 FELIX\nLUCKY VICTORY On the 21st of February the I.G. R.F.C. travelled to Shenley to continue the battle to\nsee whether or not they or U.C. R.F.C. should\nmeet Vets in the final of the Gutteridge Cup\n(the first game at Harlington the previous Wednesday had ended in a nil all draw) I.C. lost\nthe toss, and had to play against the wind;\nof time running out Dave Howard followed'\nhis example, a beautiful kick dropped just\nby the posts, was fumbled and Johnson was\nsent over to put I.C. back in the game. John\nFairfield's boot has seldom let us down, and\nhis conversation from ten yards in gave us\nthe lead, and the much needed shot in the\nMm\n0 T from the start it was all U.C. and soon play\nwas in our 25. From a tight-scrum the ball\ncame out to the U.C. stand-off whose kick\nahead bounced well, and their wing gathered\nand went over for the first try, the kick was\nun converted and after five minutes play U.C. held a30 lead. The play was really scrappy\nand several minutes later they nearly went\nfurther ahead, but Orman, covering well,\ntouched down in goal. At this stage the play\nof the backs was atrocious, the scrum half\nran too much, his kicks were knocked down\nand his service to the fly-half was horrible.\nEqually at blame, when the U.C. backs came\nthrough, the centres seemed to run in every\ndirection but the right one, but Edwards at\nfull back was in brilliant form. When the rest\nof the backs let us down he rose to the sit-u a tio well; quick tackling and fine anticipation kept the line in tact. It was left\nto skipper Kehoe to get play back in the opponents half, but not j for long. Soon the I.C. team were doggedly defending their line\nWithin the space oj four minutes four penalties were awarded against I.C;a pretty good\nexample of the low standard of play to which\nwe had sunk. One of the kicks right in front\nof the posts was thankfully missed. It was\nEdwards who stole all the glory and praise;\na brilliantly jug ded tackle by him nipped another U.C. scoring effort in the bud. So at\nhalf time we were down by only 3 points,\nbut how lucky we were, it could well have\nbeen many more.\nThe second half started with Ravno, after\ncatching, running some 40 yd s. before being\nstopped. This was just the tonic we needed\nand for a moment things began to click. However, it didn't last, and play soon degenerated\nto the first half fiasco. Bad passes, interceptions, failure in playing the ball; all quickly\nresulted in Orman and Edwards being worked\novertime, and the touch line supporters almost\ngave up. Mrs. Vine kept morale high, and the\nwilling voices once again pleaded with their\nteam. A Ravano \"up and under\" showed how\nadvantageous a high kick was; with the sands\narm. Suddenly we seemed on top; an orthodox passing move gave Johnson another great\nopportunity, but the pass was bad and he\nknocked on. Then U.C. pulled all the stops\nout and played switched dramatically to the\nI.C. end, but man mountain Edwards was\nthere again (how well he played) and play\nreverted back to the U.C. end. A set-scrum\nsome ten yards out gave I.C. the chance to\nshowed just how superior their pack was, and\nthey did this in no uncertain manner, a well\ncontrolled push, and Smith had the ball over\nfor try number two. Fairfield's kick was just\nshort (8-3). The last seconds ticked by and\nit was all over, we were through; to complete\nanother part of the amazing last decade of\nI.C. successes .\nPOST MORTEM J.

SOCCERCLUB With the season three-quarters gone the\nclub's success is still very much in the bal-ance. The 1st XI could have won the Premier\nDivision of the University league last Wednesday by beating Kings, but a goal in the\nlast five minutes only just earned I.C. an undeserved draw, 2-2 and the outcome of the\nleague will have to wait until the last match\nin a fortnight's time with Goldsmiths. This\npoor display against Kings followed two good\nleague victories over UC and QM C but last\nSaturday saw Southampton University beat\na lethargic IC side 4-1.\nThe second XI after a moderate start this\nterm again have a good chance of winning\ntheir division of the league by virtue of 3-i win over Kings II last Wednesday. The 3rd XI who were leading Division II (R) of the\nleague at Christmas also made a bad start\nthis term but may yet gain promotion. They\ncompleted their league fixtures with wins over\nUCI V and QM C III by 3-1 and 2-1 respect-iv ely. The 4th XI are still without a league\nwin, but the 5th XI see rn certain of winning\nDvision III (R) of the league, having won\ntheir last 8 league matches, the latest being\n3-0 and 5-1 victories over Northern Poly II\nand Chelsea II, respectively, but lost 9-2 to\nBrunei College I on Wednesday, their only\ndefeat this term. The 6th XI have suffered a lot this term from cancelled fixtures but won\ntheir only game in the past fortnight, 5-0 against City Bank. On Saturday the 7th XI beat Barclays Bank 3-2 which atones somewhat for their narrow defeats in the two previous matches. The) Extra 7th XI lost their\n2nd match of the season on Saturday by 4-1\nto Polytechnic, after an excellent performance\nthe previous week when they held West Ham\nCollege 1st to a11 draw in Hyde Park.\nTomorrow sees the climax of the season\nat Motspur Park when IC meet QM C in the\nfinal of the UL Knock out Cup. Victory\nwould mean that the Cup would come to IC\nfor the fourth successive season, so why not\ncome and help cheer us on?\nD.H. I.C. THRASHES OXFORD DOLPHINS\nFielding very much a second string team,\nOxford University Dolphins were well beaten\nin the Swimming and soundly thrashed in\nthe Polo. Cambridge Tadpoles paid us the\ncompliment of swimming several varsity\nmatch players but were still downed in\nthe Polo.

R.F.C In October, with the nucleus of last years\nvery successful team remaining, prospects for\nthe coming season were bright. However, several factions have combined which have resulted in the club having a rather lean seas-on. The records at present are:\n1st XV P \u201413; W \u2014 2; L \u2014 2;\n2nd XV P \u2014 8; W \u20142; L \u2014 6;\nAfter the I. C.1st XV had been selected,\nwe were faced with the problem of building\na team almost from scratch. The trial, as\nusual, revealed some talent but left a lot more\nunseen so that for the first few games the\nteams were never the same twice running.\nThis term, after a good start, sees the loss, of\nanother key player to I.C; and exams, have\nonce again meant that the first XV have been\nvery unsettled. The second XV, as is inevitable for a reserve team, has been very unsettled too; and unfortunately at times has not\nbeen fielded owing to lack of s nan r power. However, it has produced some good performances at those times when reasonably con-s tant. Prospects for the SDarke's Cup Match, when\nI.C. and U.L. players are valuable are good.\nHence, another will take place on March 7th and 23rd and all support will be very we l come.\nCG. R.F.C. The rugby season of 1961-62 started off in\nthe usual manner with a rather chaotic fresh-er's trial. From a total of 40 the talent was\nsorted out and with a heavy fixture list to\nfulfil, the prospect looked premising. However, as usual, the I.C. Wednesday team tooK\na heavy tool on our playing resources; all the\nfirst team positions have at one time or another this season been filled by Guildsmen\nwith ten playing regularly. This does credit\nto the Club but reflects rather obviously on\nour record. To date the Guild's first team\nhas won two matches and drawn one, but\nmention must also he made of five cancel-lat ions, four of them consecutive lv. The second team, under Chris Head, consists mainly\nof the unbeaten I. C.B.7 team and can show\na much more impressive record, with seven\nwon and one drawn. A third team has been\nregularly chosen but difficulty has arisen in\narranging fixtures. However, they have done\nwell in winning four out of seven.\nThe Club membership to date is over sixty\nand an impressive turnout is guaranteed for\nthe Sparkes' Cup. The support of all Guildsmen is vital for these matches which will be\nplayed on the first two Wednesdays in March.\nA. TAURINS\n\n"
