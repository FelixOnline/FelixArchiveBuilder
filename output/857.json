    "content": "The Delator Columnby Paul Shanley\nThe recommendations contained within the report by\nLord Justice Taylor only confirm what every soccer\nfan and pundit has been saying for years.\nThe main proposals in Taylor's report; the bringing\ndown of perimeter fencing, improved catering and\ntoilet facilities, closer crowd control using closed\ncircuit television etc are a matter of commonsense.\nTaylor breaks new ground in recommending new\ncriminal offences to cover pitch invasion and the\nchanting of obscene or racial abuse. Again, these\nseem to be perfectly reasonable suggestions. Why\nweren't they implemented before?\nPerhaps the most controversial measure is the\nsuggestion that all grounds should be made all-seater\nstadia. This has come as a culture shock to many. The\nBritish are accustomed to standing to watch soccer,\njust as the Europeans are to sitting down. I would not\ngive up my place on the terraces if offered a seat in\nthe stand. West Ham United carried out a survey to\nthis effect last season. The overwhelming message\nfrom supporters was 'We prefer to stand'.\nIt's a question of atmosphere. No doubt, our way\nof thinking will change. Following Hillsborough,\nLiverpool unveiled plans to turn the Kop into an all-seating area. Uproar followed. Scousers have now\naccepted the idea, even though they are opposed to\nit. In 1981, Coventry City's Highfield Road ground\nwas converted to all-seated. Two years later, the\nterracing was back. Fans had expressed their\ndisapproval and so the club had bowed to public\npressure.\nThe Taylor Report was followed by the infighting\nof Who Pays the Bill?\nThe government claims that the conversion to all-seater stadia, improving of refreshment areas etc\nshould be met fully by the clubs themselves. They cite\nPage 10\nthe \u00a370m in transfer fees last year as an example of\nhow affluent the League clubs are. This is quite\nincorrect. Only a handful of the 92 clubs made a profit\nlast year. The transfer fee money travels in a closed\ncircle. Viewed externally, no income has been\ngenerated.\nThere is a sum payed to the Football Trust each\nyear. The Trust is a body that provides funds for both\namateur and professional clubs to carry out ground\nimprovements and maintenance. The money derives\nfrom the pools companies \u00a3 7 m is direct from the\npools; a further \u00a310 comes from Spot the Ball. This\nis a drop in the ocean compared to the estimated\n\u00a3130m needed to provide seating, let alone other\nground facilities.\nIt is time that Treasury coffers were dipped into.\nSoccer is a national pastime. The government must\nin some way provide for that, just as it does for the\narts (albeit not enough).\nThe betting levy on football pools generates \u00a3300m per year. That money could be put to good use in\nfunding the proposals in the Taylor Report.\nSo much for Taylor. What other improvements\nshould be made? Clearly, the drop in football\nattend en ce figures is due to something more than just\nsocial effects. Punters are being turned away. Why?\nThere are a number of ways to make soccer more\nattractive to prospective supporters without alienating\nexisting ones. The remedies lie with the clubs and the\nFans.\nAt a basic level, clubs must remember that fans are\npaying customers. When a consumer becomes\ndiscontented with a product or a service they receive,\nthey shop elsewhere or they stop buying the product\naltogether.\nA few ideas\n\u2022 Matchday programmes should be printed by the\nsame company with each one tailored for the match\nconcerned. In this way, all weekend games have a common core of the programme with an outside\nsection dedicated to the individual game. This scheme\nworked well in the American Soccer League up until\nits demise. The 100-page full colour programme cost\n$1 and it made a profit.\n\u2022 Pre-match and half-time entertainment should be\nlaid on. This gives fans more value for money and\nencourages them to arrive earlier thereby avoiding last\nminute crushes at turnstiles.\n\u2022 The ruling banning plastic pitches should be\nrevoked. This would enable clubs to make better use\nof their grounds. At least one London side has raised\nthe possibility of this. Wimbledon's scheme was to\nfield First Division football on a Saturday. The Sunday\nwould see the ground open again for American\nFootball. A second division of the American Football\nLeague is being discussed to allow European teams\nto do this. The idea is unfeasible without a plastic\nsurface.\n\u2022 Whole sections of grounds should be turned over\nas family enclosures. Group bookings could be catered\nfor in this way.\n\u2022 At a national level, there should be changes made\nto the rules of the game to make it more entertaining.\nThis will meet with disapproval amongst the\ntraditionalists. But football has changed before. As\ntimes evolve, so must the rulebook.\n\u2022 The quality of refereeing must improve. This can\nonly happen if referees are made professionals and\npaid at a decent wage-not expenses only.\n\u2022 Courts must impose stiffer penalties on fans who\nmisbehave-particularly abroad. There is no point in\nclubs mounting excellent security and surveillance\ntechniques to catch offenders if judges subsequently\nact leniently.\n\u2022 Minor competitions such as the Simod and Xenith\ncups should be dropped. This would increase\nattendances at more important fixtures and enable\nplayers to be match fit.\n\u2022 The FA must impose stricter penalties on players\nwho offend. It must also give the clubs themselves\nthe power to punish players harder (the maximum fine\na league side is allowed to impose is two-weeks\nwages-roughly the fee for opening a supermarket).\n\u2022 Players who commit violent offences such as\nstriking an opponent off the ball or using the\n'professional foul' should be subject to major\ndisciplinary action. The idea has been mooted of giving\nan extra cautionary power to referees-the so-called\n'Black Card'. The level of punishment should, of\ncourse, depend on the offence. It is not unreasonable,\nhowever, to expect a player caught decking an\nopponent to have to sit out the rest of the season on\nthe touch lines. These recommendations are the tip of the iceberg.\nIt is time for the League and FA to set up its own\n'Taylor Enquiry'. Maybe if that happens, British\nfootball will once again be the envy of Europe.\n\n"

    "content": "FeliX The Snack Bar\nI can already feel the Union Office hold its breath as\nI type the word above. My predecessor spent a large\npart of the year attacking the outlet and consequently\nrunning it down. I do not intend to start an all out\nonslaught.\nThe Snack Bar has lost a lot of money over the past\neighteen months and the Union has paid dearly for its\nmistakes in the refurbishment and general revamp of\nthe outlet in 1988. It has taken a lot of time to realise\nthat a snack bar is exactly what it says it is; a place\nwhich provides snacks. The kitchens in the Snack Bar\nare under equipped for large scale hot food production,\nand the cost of meals in this range is too high to be\nprofit worthy. The relaunch of the Snack Bar as a Sandwich Bar is a wise move in my mind. The plans\nwhich Ian Richards, the manager of the Snack Bar,\nhas shown me provide strong hope for good, filling,\neconomical food in the Union Building. I hope that\neveryone who has moved away from eating in the\nUnion Building will take advantage of the introductory\noffer and try the 'Caterpillar Cafe' once more.\nHaving said this I feel it is only fair to point out the\nfailings of the Union over this outlet in the past. Whilst\nthe Snack Bar has been losing money every day, too\nmuch attention has been spent on petty points, like\nthe fine details of menu selection. The Union Catering\nCommittee has only just approached the main\nproblem-people have not been eating in the outlet,\nand it has been selling food at a loss. People are not\ndriven away by the decor or a particular dish they do\nnot like, they are put off by high prices and small\nportions; something the Snack Bar became famous\nfor last year. The final realisation that you do not make\nfood that has sold badly before and that you cannot\nsell prepackaged food cheaply has finally dawned.\nThe crux of the problem is the plethora of meetings\nwhich decide how the snack bar is run. Ian Richards\nhas been almost helpless to make any changes to the\noutlet without first visiting these committees. He sees\nwhat sells and what does not, and yet he has had little\nsay in menu selection within catering committee. If\nthe Union has had one major failing over the Snack\nBar it must be that of its bureaucratic quagmire which\nslows the development of any Union outlet. If Ian is\nto manage the snack bar, let him manage. After all,\nif this relaunch fails, who stands to lose their job; Ian\nor the Union Sabbaticals?\nPeter's book for the week\nPeter Hallworth is Managing Surveyor of Residences\nand looks after the upkeep of halls of residence and\nthe Union Building. Each week I have been\nmetaphorically awarding him a book. This week's book is the Pied Peter of Hamlet, perhaps Mr\nHallworth would like to invest in a flute now, I 've\nheard he is very good on the violin.\nThe Careers Service\nI invite any letters for comment on IC's impending loss\nof the Careers Library. If anybody has a spare\n\u00a310,000 please could they let the Rector know.\nSabbatical elections\nIf you want to be a sabbatical, you must be mad.\nBeing mad is fun, however. Anybody thinking of\nstanding for a sabbatical post should let me know if\nthey have any special requirements such as specially\ncoloured paper or inks.\nSabbatical videos\nI have been asked to plug STOIC's live transmission\nof this year's Hustings UGM and their election video\nfacilities. Anybody interested in making a promotional\nvideo for their sabbatical campaign should contact\nSTOIC on 3518 before February 27.

    "content": "Eurotunnel\u2014the environment\nWhatever your views on the future impact of the\nChannel Tunnel on Britain's economy, it is impossible\nto deny that its construction has had a huge effect\non the natural environment of Kent.\nLast Thursday Dr Liz Culbard of Eurotunnel gave a talk to the Environmental Society about how the\ncompany has been trying to meet the environmental\nchallenge.\nAs far back as 1985, when the Tunnel project was\nstill receiving a bumpy ride through Parliament, the\nEurotunnel company approached 130 environmental\nagencies in an effort to assess the possible visual\nimpact, as well as noise and dust pollution of the\nproposed project.\nThey were mainly concerned with three areas, all\ndesignated areas of special scientific interest \u2014\nShakespeare Cliff near Dover; Biggins Wood, which\nis an area of ancient oak/ash forest, part of which has\nalready been lost through construction of the M20;\nand Holywell Coombe, which is of interest because\nof its marshy habitat and archaeological finds.\nShakespeare Cliff has been the centre of\nenvironmental concern before. It was here in 1982\nthat a transformer, left over from the 1974 attempt\nto build a tunnel, leaked 200 gallons of PCB, a toxic\npollutant. An estimated 1500 tonnes of chalk cliff side\nwas contaminated, with the clean up operation\ncosting around \u00a32'A million. So, bearing in mind this\ntainted history, Eurotunnel has had to try and meet\nthe stringent demands of the Nature Conservancy\nCouncil (NCC) and other environmental bodies.\nThe environmental management has fallen broadly\ninto three categories: assessment, conservation and\nlong term monitoring. Assessment has meant\nstudying possible damage to ecological populations\nas diverse as spider orchids and bats. The latter could\nbe drastically effected if, for instance, rabies was\ncarried to Britain-one of the more sinister possibilities\nof the Channel link. Chemical pollution effects can be\nassessed by fresh water stream surveys.\nArchaeology has figured greatly in the conservation\nwork that has been carried out. Over the areas of\ncountryside scheduled to be lost in the building of the\nterminal etc, hundreds of trial pits were dug. Finds\nhave provided a detailed picture of continuous\nsettlement in the area from Neolithic hunter/gatherers,\nto slash and burn agriculture and finally settled\nfarming communities. A picture of bad land\nmanagement also emerges, with den ud ation and soil\nerosion causing settlements to move with striking\nsimilarity to the effects of deforestation seen in Brazil\ntoday.\nAnother scheme has concerned four grade 2 listed\nbuildings including a mill listed in the Doomesday Book\nwhich has been relocated, timbers and all.\nPerhaps the most ambitious of all the conservation\nschemes is the transplanting of Biggins Wood. The\nlarge trees were cut down and then the topsoil\nskimmed off and relaid in an area further from the\nconstruction site. Regrowth has begun but the ground\nis further down slope and so wetter than the original\nsite. Only time will tell if an ancient wood can adapt\nto such dramatic change.\nIn geological circles too, the Tunnel project has\nunveiled some valuable information. The tunnel has\nbeen realigned from its original course to preserve a geological formation of interest. To do this the area\nwas 'peppered' with boreholes and a memoir will be\nwritten with the information they revealed.\nEurotunnel have had to commit themselves to\nmonitoring plans far beyond the building time of the\ntunnel. At Shakespeare Cliff spoil from the tunnel has\nbeen used to create 35 hectares of new land. The\neffect on algal communities of accidental release of\nthis spoil into the sea was monitored for about a year\nbefore both the company and the NCC agreed that a single natural cliff fall could release up to five times\nas much sediment, instantaneously.\nEnvironmental impact has figured strongly in the\ndesign for the English terminal. Buildings are to be low\nkey and their surroundings landscaped, so that the\nimposing beauty of the scarp scenery is still the focal\npoint of the area. Local authorities keep a close check\non design, as each phase of the surface construction\nhas to be separately approved by the local planning\nauthority-a problem not encountered in France.\nDr Culbard's talk was interesting and informative\nabout a side of the Tunnel project in which emotional\nargument on both sides has often overshadowed the\nfacts. Unfortunately her defensive attitude toward\nquestions made the debate a little one sided. One\npoint that did emerge was that there is a communication problem between British Rail and\nEurotunnel over the high speed rail link; the cause of\nthe most heated exchanges in Parliament and the\nmedia so far. In two years, according to Dr Culbard,\nBritish Rail have not approached Eurotunnel with a view to learning from the environmental problems\nalready encountered. Also, British Rail have not yet\nfinalised the exact course that the rail line is to take,\nwhich will again cause hitches at the Eurotunnel end.\nIs this lack of communication an omen for the future?\nIf it is, then P&O will be laughing.\nClare Davis, Geology 3.\nInternational week\nThis year, too, the International Night on Friday 16\nFebruary will be one of the big events. Taking place\nin the JCR and Main Dining Hall, starting at 6.30pm, it will feature the International Food Stalls, where you\nwill be able to enjoy a variety of foods and drinks from\nall over the world: Korea, Indonesia, Italy, Greece,\nChina and many, many more!

Not\nto be outdone, IC keeper Si Holden denied LSE an\nequalise r blocking with his legs when the front man\nwas clean through.\nUC V0 IC IV\u20147 IC IV\u20143 LH II\u20140\nReturning fresh from the Christmas break, are vitali sed fourth team proved that their position third from the\nbottom in the league was a travesty of justice.\nAfter Mubarik Chowdhry had missed more chances\nthan there are 'E' numbers, and captain Simon Turner\nhad missed a penalty, IC finally scored after 25\nminutes. This opened the floodgates with goals from\nBah Tamanji, Chris Collison, and eventually Mr\nChowdhry before UC gained a penalty. This was due\nto Sam Tanawy who was playing with a monumental\nhangover after the Rugby Cocktails at the Carnival the\nnight before. This was his crowning moment and he\ntook all the credit with some pride.\nNeedless to say Steve Shilling made a lightning save\nto whitewash UC for the first time in their season.\nLH II, one of the weaker teams in the league, tried to\nspoil IC's game by picking fights with anyone who\nventured in their half. Trouble really started when Bob\nNdumu put IC ahead.\nThe ref then twisted his back and had to referee\nfrom the half-way line. With this improvement in\ndecision making, IC added further goals from Mubarik\nChowdhry, who has found his scoring touch, and\nNarinder Sangha with a feeble shot the keeper decided\nwasn't worth the effort.\nSam Tantawy, having set up the second goal,\nsuddenly realised he was playing shots from\neverywhere on the pitch but narrowly failed to score.\nLadies football\nIC Dribblers\u20140 St George's0 The Dribblers brightened up a cool, grey Sunday\nafternoon in Wimbledon Park with their new, dazzling\ngreen and white hooped kit-it's just as well it's green\nas, although our footballing skills have improved, we\nstill haven't quite mastered the art of s notting out of\none nostril onto the pitch and have to make do with\nshirt sleeves. St George's obviously have the same\nproblem as they also wore green and, contrary to\npopular belief, the dragon was not slain but appeared\nlarger than life in their midfield! It was a funny ol', hard\nfought, end-to-end sort of game of two halves and the\ngirls did well to hold them to a draw. Credit must go\nto the defence and the amazing, fish-like qualities of\nour girl-wonder keeper-young Willomena Thompson!\nWhat more can I say except: 'Don't miss next week's enthralling episode-The Dribbler'd Day Trip to\nBrighton.\nSussex-11 IC Dribblers\u20140\nDidn't we have a lovely time the day we went to\nBrighton?? British Rail apologised for the inevitable\nSunday delays and so we had no time for a pre-match\npaddle in the sea and play on the fairground. Instead\nwe trekked up the mountainside in search of the\nfootball pitch-why can you never find a sherpa when\nyou need one?\nEventually the match kicked off and the scenes that\nfollowed were reminiscent of the Boys vs Masters\nrugby game in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.\nNinety minutes and eleven goals later the Dribblers\nlimped, hobbled and were carried off in search of some\nbeers to celebrate the fact that, despite being literally\nwalked over and sat on by eleven gruesome gir lies, we'd still managed to qualify for the next round of the\nUAU thanks to Brunei pulling out. They'd obviously\nheard how big and mean the Sussex girls are and how\ndifficult it is to get food, drink or a half-time orange\nout of them! We must thank our lucky stars for the\nmiracle of the twenty beers, four bowls of soup and\nthree garlic mushrooms, performed by the staff of\nPizzaland! Despite the score line we still managed to\nsmile, sink a few beers and sing a few songs as well\nas annoying bus conductors, Russian spy s and\nstrange women but that's another story!\nRifle\nIC's Rifle Team beat teams from Loughborough and\nCity with an amended score of 1000.530, the highest\nscore out of the 51 teams, in the first round of the\ninter-university rifle team handicap competition.

Stude Music\nWell you're a student now, so throw away your\nSmash Hits, your SAW 1\" singles and your Bros\nposters, grow up, grab a copy of 'Sounds', Pink Floyd\nLP and some tour posters. Yes we're talking 'student\nsubculture'.\nSo you ask, 'what do I listen to so as not to be\n(shudder) un trendy?' a) Classical music. This is so 'out' it's 'in'. The great\nthing is you can bullshit to your bottom's content\nabout it's depth and meaning and the composer won't contradict you in a magazine interview. It's also a good investment, some of Mahler's early picture discs\nfetch up to \u00a330. Be warned though, groups rarely\nsupply lyrics with albums and many ballet-o the ques have shut due to rumours of acid concertos.\nb) Old shite. Most low profile 60s groups fall into\nthis category. Make sure you choose a group with a dead singer, and say things like 'Modern music is too\ncommercial' or 'there's no lyricism' or 'Yes, but listen\nto Transformer for a timeless classic'.\nThe genre is best represented by the lyrics of Lou\nMorrison of the group The Velvet Papas Airplane\nRevival:\nRiding down a sun baked highway\nWith a bad moon staring at my woman\nFuck me where did all these purple parrots come\nfrom?'\nc) Heavy metal. To be a 'Metal' fan, you must grow\nyour hair very long (not washing it helps too), wear\nleather jackets and black t shirts with pictures of\nzombies, sheep skulls an cf semi-naked women. You\ndon't have to listen to anything, because you should\nlook so hard that people don't ask you about the\nmusic.\nd) Obscure stuff. This is where it's at. The live\nbands, indie bands, singles bands. All you need is a band like Mick No-one and the Esoterics that no one's heard of, and won't do except through you. Things\nto look for are an independent label (this is so you can\ncomplain when the band move to a major l able), a stupid name eg The Left-Legged Pineapples, and\nrecords that don't reach the top 1,000 and even John\nPeel hasn't heard of them. It is important that\nwhichever band you pick you must insist they are\ndoing 'something revolutionary' to the music industry.\nThe exception to the above is of course that\nultimate of s tude bands, those doyen's of the beds it pop; The Smiths. In the words of Morrissey the\nMesiah:\n'Britain make me so sad\nYou won't love me\nAnd I 've messed up my life,\nBut at least I'm rich and famous ha ha ha'\nThat's all for this week and remember folks: punk\nis not dead (it just smells that way).\nDanny Shiu\nFREE food!\nFELIX will be conducting a survey of the food outlets in College over the coming week.\nWe want three volunteers, who are independent of FELIX and IC Union and are not\nemployed in any of the College bars or food outlets.

The survey will consist of a 'blind' purchase from each outlet, ie the serving staff\nshould not know you are working on the survey. Photographs will be taken of the food\nand the surroundings. In order to maintain a consistent approach within three different\ngroups in college, we will require one male undergraduate, one female undergraduate and\none postgraduate.\nThe first three students within these categories to come into the FELIX Office (far\nleft corner of Beit Quad, over Prince Consort Rd) will receive free food for a week, courtesy of FELIX.\n\n"

    "content": "The Rector's decision to remove the post of Information Officerfrom the Careers Advisory Service was rash\nand ill thought-out.\nThe worst cut\nIntroduction\nIt was recently decided to 'squeeze' the Careers\nAdvisory Service (CAS) by removing the key post of\nInformation Officer. This will, at the very least, ensure\na massive reduction in the service provided to\nstudents, and could, in the long term, lead to a de centralised CAS run by the departments. If this\nwere to happen, many students would be forced into\nresearch or engineering through a lack of expert ese within such a departmental CAS.\nThe CAS at Imperial College has undergone major\nchanges in the last few years. From being a disorganised service used by few it has undergone\nextensive improvement to become a useful facility\nused by 80% of students. Backed up by the London\nUniversity facility at Gordon Square, IC students have\na comprehensive Careers Advisory Service.\nMoney\n\u00a315,000 was spent over the Summer, refitting the\nCAS. The office houses a library with extensive\ninformation on paper and on video, and has a computer running careers guidance software. Private\ncompanies will pay to use such a facility-currently,\n\u00a313,000 is pulled in.\nNow, after all the refurbishment and reorganisation,\nthe Rector has decided to remove the post of\nInformation Officer, currently paid about \u00a310,000,\nwithout whom the service will no doubt fall apart.\nNeedless to say, private companies will not pay to use\nthe facilities of a failing CAS, and so \u00a313,000 will be\nlost. The Rector seems misguided when he calls this\na cost-cutting exercise.\nThe Service\nAccording to a recent survey, 80% of undergraduates\nuse the CAS. Most of these (85%) use the Information\nRoom, helped by the Information Officer. The majority\nof students found the service convenient when they\nused it, though a third thought it understaffed.\nUsing the office directly may involve researching a wide range of careers using the extensive information\nprovided. The Information Officer is a key part of this\nside of the service. She organises the library and can\nhelp students find exactly what they need, whether\nin a book or on one of the many videos available in\nthe Information Room. Indirectly, the CAS provides\nthe information found in departments; the\ndepartments themselves have little to do with this\nservice. Again the Information Officer helps to provide\ndepartments with the necessary leaflets and booklets.\nThe Rector proposes to use occasional\nby Steve Meyfroidt\nWhat you stand to lose\u2014the careers library\ncompleting their three or four years here. This being\nthe case, a departmental careers service would fail\nto provide half the students with the service they\nrequire. Tutors would push unwilling students into\nresearch or the engineering industry, and would be\nunable to help those wanting to enter, for example,\naccountancy or publishing.\nSummary\nImperial College needs a comprehensive CAS.\nStudents come to IC for reasons of prestige, and are\njust as likely to leave science as to continue in their\nsubject area after graduation. The Rector should wake\nup to this fact and give the CAS the backing and\nfinances it needs to serve the wide range of IC\nstudents. He certainly should not be trying to cut back\non this vital service.\npostgraduate help to replace the Information Officer.\nUntrained, occasional labour can in no way replace\nthis important post and, unfortunately, without it the\nCAS will probably grind to a halt.\nDepartmental Services\nThe Rector's attitude to the CAS is hinted at by the\ncomment he made two weeks ago that 'we don't have a desperate need to find jobs for obscure\ndepartments.' This suggests that he expects all\ngraduates to drift into the obvious jobs in research and\nindustry. In this case, there would be no problem in\nclosing down the centralised CAS which deals with\nall possible careers, and replacing it with advice from\ntutors in individual departments. Unfortunately, the\nRector's attitude does not reflect the fact that about\n50% of graduates want to escape from science after\nThe Imperial College Union Handbook\nImperial College Union needs a student to edit its Handbook. The editor will be paid for six weeks during the holiday\nand provided with a free room in hall.\nThe Summer work involves a large amount of production and editing. The FELIX editor will be available throughout the\nproduction period for help and advice on all aspects. This job is not just one for FELIX hacks. If you fancy working\ntowards producing a publication over 90 pages thick, which you will be able to call your own creation, why not pop\ninto the FELIX Office for a chat to find out more?\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Indie Spectacular\nThe Indie Spectacular hyped in last week's FELIX took\nplace last Friday in the Union Lounge. A good time\nwas had by all. THE END.\nThat e nuff?... No, I suppose not, well actually I should\nstop pissing about and write something constructive...\nblah blah blah the Union Lounge...\nThe Septembers were initially greeted with a tiny\ngathering, most folks having retired to the bar, but\ntheir complex guitar sound soon edged across the\nfoyer and the crowd grew.\nThey played a set of medium length and excessive\nenthusiasm; while the vocalist and the bass were\nhardly wallflowers they were overwhelmed by the\nguitarist, who bounded across, up, down and around\nthe stage like a muppet on acid. The music style varied\nfrom traditional indie-pop to wah guitar the way the\nStone Roses ought to do it.\nRain took to the stage in a haze of white guitar noise\nbefore exploding into a confusion of sex goth blood music. The crowd flagellated wildly.\nNo, actually this is all bollo x. Rain took to the stage\nlike it would bite them; if The Septembers were\nmuppets on acid, Rain were cabbage patch dolls on\ndope.\n'Some people say we're as miserable as foo kl' announced the merry gentlemen on guitar. 'But we're\nnot!' Miserable they weren't; stage leaping maniacs\nthey weren't either. Their music, competent folk-tinged and (alas) forgettable came close to moving the\nRain\ncrowd on several occasions but it was only the finale\nand encore that energy seeped into the gig.\nRain and The Septembers both deserve to be much\nbigger than they are. Look out for them on the Fraggle\nRock side of independence in 1990.\nStone.\nThe Septembers\nRide\nFeet First Night at Camden Palace has run for three\nsuccessful years with alternative rock and indie music\nall night, plus an 'up and coming' band live every\nweek.\nThe music includes the likes of The Cure, The Cult,\nThe Sisters of Mercy, Birdland, The Smiths, The Jesus\nand Mary Chain and much, much more and recent\nbands have included The Membranes, Medicine\nFactory, Neds Atomic Dustbin and recent music media\nfavourites Ride\nRide have, of late, had attention focussed onto their\nEP Ride, but it has been their increasingly large live\nPage 6\n-Feet First at Camden Palace\n23.1.90\nfollowing that has shaped their reputation so far,\nattracting substantial offers from the major labels.\nThey finally plumped for the small but renowned\nCreation Records, early home of The Jesus and Mary\nChain amongst others.\nLike the Mary Chain, Ride take classic themes and\nturbo charge them; their live sound is harsh and\noccasionally slips a pure pop break in. Also like the\nMary Chain they use noise, but whereas the former\nuses it as random backing, Ride's is more controlled;\nthe songs erupt at strategic moments, igniting\nfeedback like a blow torch.\nBop Station\u2014Until Lisbon\nBop Station is the alter ego of one third year PhD\nchemist, Matt Duck who writes and records songs\nwhilst not pushing back the frontiers of science.\nStephen Morrisey he is not, but whilst it would be\neasy to fatuously dismiss Until Lisbon as self-indulgent\nand primitive the songs he writes are a cut above\nmany by 'established artists' and there is as much to\nlike or dislike about this as there is Morrisey's own\nbrand of self exposure.\nThe primitive aspect cannot be denied. A four-track\nrecorder in the bedroom is no substitute for a recording studio and at times vocal ambitions exceed\nhis abilities but generally the quality of this is\nsurprisingly high.\nThe music is basically unpretentious; guitar,\nCasioesque keyboard and drum machine where\nrequired. He sings songs associated with some\nemotional or sexual experience but the lyrics tend to\nbe cryptic and the overall effect is soothing without\nbeing soporific. Claiming influences of the likes of\nScott Walker, Momus, the French poet Jacques Brel\n(name dropped on the recent Marc Almond LP) and\nEverything But the Girl's Ben Watt (particularly North\nMarine Drive) it is plain that there is little to link it to\nmainstream styles. However at times it is reminiscent\nof Edwyn Collins, Tanita Tikaram and the whimsical\nacoustic sound of Anthony Phillips on the early\nGenesis albums (particularly on the title track and\nBreathless). Highlights are the retrospective Boy\nThoughts, Queen of Hearts, and the delightful Lost\nMy Way. Matt Duck is trying to flog copies of his\ndebut cassette at \u00a32. If anyone out there is interested\ncontact him on x4664 or via the Chemistry PG letter\nracks.\nAlso any other budding artists out there in College,\nget yourself some exposure by sending material to\nFELIX; it can't do you any harm.\nC.D. L. Ride-Ride EP\nRide's vinyl sound is equally impressive as their live\nsound; while necessarily lacking the power of the live\nsound, the tunes and guitar work have more chance\nto show themselves. This debut EP contains four\nsongs: Close My Eyes, All I Can See, Chelsea Girl (no\nSimple Minds connection) and the phenomenal Drive\nBlind-e acr\\ song worthy of release in its own right.\nWatch them grow.\nStone.\n\n"

The\nsection in question should read.\n'...believe in God...Well yes I do, but not like that,\nmuch more, well in a more sort of vague, illogical but\nkind of practical sense.'\nMy point is perhaps (the interpretation is yours!)\nthat faced with the world's idea of logic, believing in\nan all-encompassing, suffering God and all that that\nimplies is patently crazy.\nSo why does it work?\nUnderstanding God comes not from logical\nargument, but through the day's experiences, good\nand bad, and from God's love in real people.\nYours,\nRobert Cumming, Physics PGI.\nNo more\nplease\nI am sick to the back teeth of the way some\npeople seem to be abusing the letters pages of\nFELIX as a ground for 'spreading the word.'

The root cause of the\nmaterialistic attitude in our society is the belief that\nthe responsibility for other people's problems does not\nlie on the people but on the government. This belief\ncauses people to contentedly wash their hands of the\nproblems around them, and work solely on their own\nself-advancement.\nThatcherism tries to change this attitude and and\nawaken a sense of individual responsibility for yourself\nand those around you.

About\nnow you will have received a leaflet advertising the\nSERC-CRAC graduate schools. It is not to be thrown\naway even if initially you don't fancy it because it is\nfree (\u00a3330 if you are not SERC sponsored) and any\nchance to get that much out of our esteemed\nsponsors must be worth it. CRAC is actually a charity\nand being the Careers Research Advisory Centre it is\nus who are the recipients of this charity. So it is not\njust the elderly, the handicapped and the Third World\nwho benefit from that word although I don't foresee\na Live-Aid style concert in aid of CRAC.\nThe purpose of the graduate summer schools, or\nCRAC courses as we veterans call them, is to open\nour eyes to what we can do. We academic scientists\nwho beaver away with chemicals or lasers discovering\nuseless things about Life and the Universe, often miss\nout on everything. We are blind to the useful talents\nour studies give us. I ask you, how useful is the\nknowledge gained from squinting at our narrow\nscientific discipline for three years? But the\ncommunication, writing, decision making and\norganisational skills we use every day and take for\ngranted are actually quite useful too. Yes, that is all\na Management Consultant does, take data, analyse\nit and advise people on what to do next, avoiding\nresponsibility for it in case it is crap yet still making\na big wedge in the process.\nStill not convinced? Well for five days you can\nforget work, go somewhere different, meet exciting\nnew people and interact with them. This has\napparently given CRAC courses a reputation for a week of bed hopping and torrid sex. I missed all that\nbut I drank a lot, got a great suntan and had FUN.\nWhat happens is that you play at different types of\nmanagement, from research through personnel to\nbeing an EEC minister or management consultant.\nThis is done as part of well worked out exercises and\nsituations where everyone gets a chance to contribute\nand achieve something through teamwork, an\nexperience notably absent from your average PhD,\nUltimately it doesn't matter if you cock it up as it is\nonly an exercise but everyone gets so involved that\npride becomes paramount. CRAC tutors are always\non hand to comment on teamwork and group progress\nand to ensure that the groups don't stray too far from\nthe task in hand and degenerate into a screaming\nbunch of ego maniacs, although the arguments are\noften heated. Also present are industrial executives\nand graduates who have a few years experience in\nthe workplace and can be helpful but are as likely to\nmake fools of themselves as the rest of us. There is\na business game too which is usually selling boilers\nor computers. I defy anyone to try and lose more\nmoney than I did with my own Phoenix Boilers Co in\nthree short days.\nVenues range from student halls of residence (it is\namazing just how bad Southside is compared to other\nuniversity halls) to conference centres where the\nmeals are served by penguin suited waiters. They are\ncompletely informal and have none of the pressure of\ncompany vacation courses. This probably sounds\nterribly overstated but the experience is incredible and\nexhausting. I spent a week recovering from mine and\nno one ends up disappointed.\nSimilar to this are the Company vacation courses.\nOstensibly PR exercises to give students (both UG and\nPG) the chance to 'experience' what industry is like\nthey also afford the opportunity for companies to size\nup students and vice-versa. Hence your expenses are\npaid, you get put up in a nice hotel and there are a couple of decent scoffs bunged in to give a favourable\nimpression. For this, J student must dress up relatively\nsmart, behave himself by not taking too much\nadvantage of the free bar at the reception, and ask\nmoderately intelligent questions when the opportunity\narises.\nProcter and Gamble do not have any recruitment\naspect but give all successful applicants a second\ninterview anyway. The emphasis is along the same\nlines as CRAC, involving exercises to demonstrate\nvarious aspects of management and group working\nbut as is to be expected the bottom line is always\nrelevant to P&G. They also throw in a site tour and\na chance to talk to some 'young' managers over\ndinner. It is all jolly good fun, designed to persuade\nyou that P&G is a dynamic managerial company\n(which of course it is) and that you want to work for\nthem.\nICI recruitment course (subtle working in the title)\ndo not have any recruitment aspect but in The\nExercise (deciding how ICI goes about taking over the\nEastern Block) all the ICI people take notes on each\ngroup and only some people get second interviews\nafterwards. This course is much more a polishing of\nthe ICI corporate image than P& Gi.e. each group\nexplains its business areas whilst we try not to look\ntoo bored. They show us videos on ICI and the\nenvironment and we try not to laugh too much as the\nCFC plant outside spews another 100 tonnes of acid\nrain ingredients into the atmosphere. (It's only steam\ncoming out of those chimneys, honest!) They give us\ndinner with both junior and senior management. We\ntry not to enjoy the venison too much in case we give\naway our lack of table manners or spill gravy on the\ntablecloth. This is of course jolly good fun and the only\nprice is that you are under scrutiny, but that is only\nto be expected in the circumstances.\nIn truth, any course is valuable experience as it gives\none the opportunity to find things out at no cost. In\nfact the expenses fiddles can make it lucrative if the\ncourse happens to be some distance away. They are\ngood fun if you go with the right attitude, not being\ndetermined to ar selick and impress but to observe and\ncompare notes with the other students, and of course\nstay up late and drink a lot. They are worth the time\nas an aid to sorting out the wheat from the chaff in\nthe recruitment mill. Ultimately though it's something\nfor nothing and no student can turn down an offer like\nthat.\nC.D. L. The Independent on Sunday\nThe Independent first appeared, fully formed and\ncompletely opinion less, over three years ago. Its\nstated aim, to be a 'quality' newspaper on a par with\nthose great bastions of what was once Fleet Street:\nthe Times, the Telegraph and the Guardian. After a somewhat shaky start, it flourished, a haven for\nrefugees from Murdochism. Not even its worst enemy\nwould deny that the Indy has done well against stiff\nand hostile opposition and not even a deaf-blind hermit\ncould have failed to notice the hype. The Independent\nhas spawned. The Sunday Indy has been born.\nOn the face of it, Indy 2 should have been born with\nthe publishing equivalent of a silver spoon in its\nmouth. It was entering a market until recently\ndominated by the over-opinionated Sunday Telegraph,\nthe defoliating Sunday Times and the rapidly-deteriorating Observer, But there was a cloud on its\nhorizon in the uncomfortably identical shape of the\nSunday Correspondant.\nThe Correspondant and the Independant are very\nsimilar beasts. The respective news pages are\naccurate but unexciting, the features well written but\nuncompromisingly uncontroversial and the columnists\nPage 12\nfar too well informed to say anything remotely silly.\nBoth are definitely 'serious' newspapers. Even the\ndesigns seem similar. The news-stand just ain't big\nenough for the both of them.\nBoth compare well with their opponents, both are\nlarge but nowhere near as col loss al as the paper-boy\nflattening Sunday Times. Neither seem to suffer from\nthe petty vindictiveness which the Observer calls\ninvestigative journalism-I personally do not give a damn who owns Harrods. Both make the tabloids look\nlike the newsprint loo paper.\nThere are small differences. The Correspondant\nproduces a magazine, the Indy, tabloid-sized pull-outs\na la Saturday Guardian. The Indy comes in three parts,\nthe Correspondant in two plus mag.\nAnyone can see there is going to be a war. The two\npapers will fight for the hearts and filo faxes of the\nsame group of ad-man's' ABd' s. Unless one\nchanges, either one or both may collapse leaving us\nthe un savoury choice between Worsthorne, Trelford\nand Neill.\nJL\n\n"

    "content": "Kelman Vincent Nicholson Kewney Jenkins\nBreaking and entering\nA few weeks ago a debate was held on the title\n'Should Hacking be Illegal'. On Wednesday 17th January a number of involved parties gathered at\nImperial College. They included Judith Vincent from\nthe Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Guy\nKewney from Personal Computer World (PCW), Emma\nNicholson MP, leading barrister Alistair Kelman, and\nJolyon Jenkins from the New Statesman.\nMrs Nicholson put forward the 'Anti-Hacking Bill'\nearly in Spring 1989. The Bill was hastily drawn up\nbut though there was much interest in it, it failed to\nbecome an act of Parliament.\nA report by the Law Commision later that year,\nproposed that the following should be made illegal:\n(i) Unauthorised access to a computer;\n(ii) Unauthorised access to a computer with intent to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of a serious crime;\n(Hi) Unauthorised modification of computer material.\nWhen the Government made no movement towards\nacting on the recommendations in the Queen's speech, Mrs Nicholson, among others, press uri sed Michael Colvin M.P. to introduce a Private Member's Bill based on the report.\nSpeaking first, Mrs Vincent thought that it was\nimpossible to differentiate between innocent and\nabusive hackers. She recommended a series of\npenalties in line with the offence, and so seemed to\nback the report.\nFrom PCW Mr Kewney agreed to the need in\nincreased legislation, but in the area of freedom of\ninformation.\n'I think that there is a definite shortage of legislation\non the subject of what information is, who is entitled\nto hide it, and who is entitled to see it.' he stressed.\nHe went on to suggest that 90% of computer crime\nis committed by internal staff, rather than external\nhackers as the CBI maintains.\nBefore politics, Mrs Nicholson worked with\ncomputers for 23 years, and hence her interest in the\nsubject. She was dissatisfied with the \u00a31000\nmaximum fine for hacking related activities, even\nthough cases of \u00a375,000 damages have been\nreported.\nShe advocated tighter legislation, particularly in the\narea of personal information. She raised the question\nof ownership of such information, citing the case of\n'smart cards' (electronic credit cards storing your\nhealth record), where taxes would need to be raised\nto employ high security methods of protecting\npersonal data.\nWhere ownership of the information is in question,\npersonal data is vulnerable to abuse. Should taxes be\nraised to employ high security methods to protect\nagainst misuse?\nPrickoCon 8\nHowever, she c once ede d in saying,'I would not\nsuggest that legislation against computer hacking will\nstop computer hacking; what I am saying is that it\nindicates a. barrier beyond which society does not\nbelieve an action is socially acceptable.'\nThe barrister, specialising in copyright laws, was\nconcerned that increased legislation would lead to\ninnocent young computer users being lured into\ncriminal activities.\nFor present cases, the law can be worked around\nany inadequacies, so that malicious hackers can be\nprosecuted. He held that it should be up to computer\nmanufacturers to produce secure systems to a set\nstandard, stating The major problems that we have\n... are there because the world has built itself around\nan insecure standard: the IBM PC The journalist likened hacking to trespass, which is\nnot a criminal offence. His opinion was that the law\nreport was poorly argument ed, and that in any case,\ninformation can be gained by far simpler means than\nhacking.\nAt the conclusion of the debate, voting revealed\nthat a majority were not in favour of section (i). Many\nwere confused on section (ii) but all were in favour\nof section (iii): the criminal is ation of 'unauthorised\nmodification of computer material.'\nBy Simon Bradshaw (Train-spotting club Hon Sec)\nIt's that time of year again; yes, spring, when the\nflowers bloom, the birds sing, and the Science Fiction\nSociety unveils the latest PicoCon - PICOCON 8, 3rd March, 10am to 10pm in the Union Building.\n'But wait,' we hear you say, 'what is a PicoCon?'.\nWell, it's ICSF's very own Science Fiction Convention.\nHence the 'Con'. It's also very small compared with\nmany SF conventions (but as we shall see, nice things\ncome in small packages)-hence 'PicoCon'. As for\n'PicoCon 8', we'll give you a clue. There have been\nseven PicoCons before now...\n'OK, OK, but what is an SF convention?' Think\nabout some of the things ICSF does. We show films,\nright? And we have videos. We occasionally have real\nSF authors along to give us talks. Now and again we\nhave quite seriously silly fun with our counterparts\nfrom provincial holes like Oxford and Cambridge.\nCram all of these together in one event and you have\nabout half of a PicoCon!\nWe have three, yes count 'em three guests of\nPage 14\nhonour. Bob Shaw has been one of Britain's leading\nSF authors for nigh well upon twenty years, with\nworks like Orbitsville' and The Ragged Astronauts. We\nhope to be hearing one of his 'Serious Scientific' talks,\nwhich are neither scientific or very serious! Dave\nLangford is a Fan writer, book reviewer and very funny\nwriter-T/ te Leaky Establishment is probably the only\ncomedy set in an atomic weapons plant, based on\nsome of his experiences at Aldermaston! His talk on\n'Fun with Senseless Violence' will be missed at your\nperil... Dr Patrick Collins was IC's very own astronaut\ncandidate; out of 10,000+ applicants for Project\nJuno he came fifth. He'll be talking on Space Tourism,\nbut is willing to answer questions on just what they\ndo stick up your bum when they select astronauts!\nWe also have Return of the Quiz (have you ever tried\nCharades where the books have titles like Servants\nof the Wankhl) plus Panels where our erudite guests\nwill hold forth on such topics as life During\nPeacetime' and how crummy and repetitive fantasy\nwriting has become. We'll be raising money for Rag\nvia a 'Turkey Reading', where some of the worst\npurple prose ever written will be orated for you until\nenough people bid money for it to stop! Later on there\nwill be a Filk Concert-no, that's not a misprint,\n'Filking' is SF folk singing, sort of like an RCS bar night, only more so. On the subject of bars, we should have\nthe Union Bar open from 11 am to 11 pm, so there's no excuse for any sobriety.\nIf all this is a bit much, we have a fairly continuous\nvideo programme, both film and TV favourites. There\nwill be a dealer room, with book and game stalls, and\na selection of computer games for the incurable\nzap pes. We aim to provide something for everyone\ninters ted in SF, and this year we hope to be the best\nPicoCon by far. Value for money indeed-just \u00a34, or\n\u00a33.50 if you cough up before the day, eg at a film or\nlibrary meeting.\nSo, make a date with PICOCON 8.\n\n"

    "content": "Odyssey around Odysseus\nBy Beaty Rubens and Olive Taplin\nMost people have heard of Odysseus and possibly his\nmost celebrated exploit, the Trojan Horse, but this is\na book that is much more than a simple jaunt into\nfantasy.\nThe story of Odysseus and his travels, the basis of\nmany Sunday afternoon films with mystical creatures\nflying about all over the place, is based on a huge\npoem that would take nearly two days to read out.\nWritten about three thousand years ago by Homer,\nit narrates Odysseus'travels after being shipwrecked,\nand his consequent return to his wife after ten years\nof wandering.\nThe book itself explores the poem, giving evidence\nboth for and against the truthfulness of the story.\nSome people believe that much of the story is in fact\ntrue and that Homer did nothing more than write down\nbasic facts with some artistic licence. Others shun this\nidea, saying that the story has very little, if any truth\nin it and that he wrote an adventure story loosely\nbased on the local scenery.\nAfter reading the book I was left with the impression\nthat portions may well have been true, indeed much\nof it seem too coincidental for it not to be, but most\nof the story is nothing more than artistic licence.\nThroughout the book analogues are drawn against\nanother epic, a more recent one, James Joyce's 'Ulysses', set in Dublin and unlike the odyssey, lasting\nfor one day only, rather than the ten year span of the\nOdyssey.\nAlthough passages of the original poem are\ncontained within the book, it still manages to maintain\ninterest in the subject by keeping text short and to\nthe point. The text is punctuated by many quite\nattractive diagrams and pictures depicting scenes\nfrom the prose. In the centre of the book are sixteen\ncolour plates showing some of the fine pictures of the\nlandscape that is the suspected setting for the story.\nBased on a radio series it is a very good book on\nits own and if the subject matter interests you and\nyou want an easy, simple introduction into mythology\nthen it may well be worth a read,\nIan Hodge.\nBlackeyesBy Dennis Potter\nIt may seem rather strange reviewing a story that has\njust been screened as a somewhat controversial four-part series on BBC2. Having watched much of the\nseries, I, like many other viewers, was left with a sense of bewilderment, with little idea just what\nPotter was trying to say.\nLike Potter's last television piece, The Singing\nDetective, Blackeyes contained scenes where reality\ndrifted off into a fantasy world. However, at times the\nconnection was not always as clearly made.\nIn order to further my understanding of the story,\nand its deeper messages I bought a copy of the\nbook-from which the screen-play was adapted.\nFor those of you who did not see the series,\nBlackeyes tells the story of a writer, Maurice James\nKingsley, who, after a long period of inactivity, at the\nage of seventy-seven, produces a novel which\ninstantly takes the literary world by storm. Known as\nBlackeyes, the novel is the story of a model, and her\nview of London's seedy advertising sub-culture.\nIt transpires that the source of much of the novel\nis his niece, herself an ex-model. Kingsley has, in a sense, stolen her identity and laid it out for an adoring\npublic. However, fact begins to imitate fiction, the\nboundary becomes unclear, and the plot takes a sinister turn.\nIn the novel Potter challenges our male stereotypes\nof women and their role in society. The use of the\nSins of the mothers\nIpligenia (Iffy) is the half-caste daughter of a prostitute\nand a duke. She is six-foot tall, weighing 17 stone,\nand has a personality to match. Rosemary is white,\naverage and middle-class. They became close friends\nat school and this book tells of their lives, the man\nthey share and their children. The story starts pre-war,\nand continues to the present day.\nIffy has dreams of becoming an opera singer, but\nprejudice seems to prevent that. During a disastrous\nmarriage she becomes involved in her mother's trade,\nan occupation that will support her for a good part of\nher life. One day she meets Hilary, a struggling actor\nwho is destined to become her on/off lover and\nRosemary's husband.\nRosemary gives up her own acting career to become\nwife to Hilary and mother to their three children.\nRosemary and Hilary live the perfect middle-class\nexistence, while Iffy, and her son, live a wildly\nextra v agent lifestyle of almost hedonistic pleasure.\nThe children aren't quite what one would expect.\nThe book starts off with Iffy reminiscing in 1987,\nbefore slipping back to 1930 to tell of the events\nleading up to the opening, with the final section taking\nus from 1987 to the present day.\nThe events are related successfully by several of\nthe main characters, most notably Iffy, Rosie, Hilary,\nCeaser and Sally.\nFrom each narrator we are presented a different,\nand often contradictory, viewpoint on the happenings.\nPage 4\nBy Patricia Angadi\nEach has misconceptions about themselves, and\nabout others, so the whole picture is only slowly built\nup. The writing is remarkably good, convincing you\nthat whatever viewpoint you happen to be looking\nfrom is the correct one, realisation of each character's faults not coming until a good way into the book.\nBeyond the main thread of the plot a variety of\nthemes are considered. The area of discrimination is\ntouched on, but only briefly. Much more time is given\nto morality and society.\nThe morality aspect is approached from various\nangles: prostitution, incest, euthanasia are affairs all\nbeing covered.\nFirm conclusions to any of the questions posed are\nnot really reached, but then that is not really the\npurpose of the book. Instead we are left thinking about\nthese questions, many of which can never be\ndefinitively answered.\nSociety is addressed by the contrast between Iffy's lifestyle and Rosie's. They are wildly different and the\nworth of each is assessed by the success (or failure)\nof their respective offspring.\nPatricia Angudi has, in her seventies, produced a superb work, which has probably benefitted from the\nexperience of her age. She raises matters that affect\nall of us, making for a book that is worthwhile reading\nfor anybody who likes to think about their life, rather\nthan just live it.\nAdam T. female form in the advertising industry comes in for\nparticular examination, as does society's judgement\nof personality by physical appearance.\nThose of you who did persevere to the end of the\nseries might have thought that the end came\nsomewhat abruptly, and indeed the book does bring\nthe story to a much more conclusive end.\nReading this novel shows what an ambitious project\nPotter set himself in trying to adapt the story for\ntelevision. A powerful yet often subtle message.\nHighly recommended.\nDarren Austin.\nBBC Radio\nOn Monday night I went to see the pilot recording of\na new radio comedy A ff ac/c of the Little Things at the\nParis Studio. If it goes on air, it will be worth listening\nto.\nThe Paris Studio, on Lower Regent Street SW1, is\nan underground theatre where BBC radio shows are\nrecorded in front of a live audience. It's recently been\nrefurbished and is quite luxurious. As Jeremy Hardy\nsays 'It's called the Paris Studio because it used to\nbe the capital of France.'\nSo how do they fill the auditorium? By giving away\nFREE tickets! All you have to do is write to the BBC\nRadio Ticket Unit, BBC, London W1A 4WW, enclosing\na sae, and ask for a list of coming attractions. Or, if\nyou've run out of stamps, drop in at the studio, where\nthey often have spare tickets.\nComing attractions include the return of Unnatural\nActs, starting tomorrow at 7.45. It stars Jeremy\nHardy, Kit Hollerbach, Paul B. Davies and Caroline\nLeddy, all extremely funny comedians. Other comedy\nincludes The Mary Whitehouse Experience on\nWednesdays at 9.15 and And Now in Colour starting\non the 17th February at 7.15.\nIf you're more interested in quizzes, Time Cycle\nstarting on Monday is a light hearted show. If you\nwant to take part in the ABC Quiz, pick up an\napplication form at the Paris Studio.\nYou prefer music? Ask the Ticket Unit for a list of\nrecitals at the Concert Hall, Broadcasting House.\nThis is an excellent way to see the stars for the price\nof a tube ticket-you'll love it.\nToby Jones\n\n"

    "content": "Council chaos hits poll\ntax rebates\nKenneth Baker, the man who claims Poll tax as his brain child\nChaos is expected in the implementation\nof the community charge, or Poll Tax, for\nImperial College Students. Westminster\ncity council (WCC) has assumed that all\nstudents are non-students until the students\nconcerned send the council a photocopy\nof their poll tax rebate certificate, or make\na personal call with the original certificate.\nTjiis is despite IC administration being\nrequired to send full lists of student names\nand addresses, and having done so. Mr\nMalcolm Aldridge, Senior assistant\nfinance officer at I.C. said that the list is\ncompiled from the same data as the poll\ntax rebate certificates, so in effect the\nWCC are asking for the same information\ntwice. Mr Aldridge expressed\nin comprehension as to why the College\nhad been told to send the lists in the first\nplace as the data had been ignored by the\nCity council.\nThe City council has sent out forms to\nstudents claiming that they are not\nstudents, causing much confusion. Dr\nJohn Hassard, warden of Tizard and\nSelkirk halls, has advised students in his\nhall to write personally to the W CC to\ncheck that they are registered as students.\nWardens of other college halls are giving\nsimilar advice. A spokeswoman from the\nWCC said that students must enclose a photocopy of the rebate certificate given\nto all IC students at the beginning of the\nyear.\nThere are reports that the W CC are\nresponding inefficiently to such enquiries,\ninsisting that students are non-students and\nthus not entitled to the 80% rebate.\nOn being challenged, the W CC said\nthey are being deluged with enquiries, but\nthey must double check all the data. 'We\nhave to have a formal certificate', a spokeswoman said. 'You must understand\nwe are protecting students by doing this'.\nShe claimed that, so far, the council has\nprocessed data from 1700 students\u2014a fraction of the number living in\nWestminster.\nMr Aldridge commented that the silence\nfrom Kensington and Chelsea (K&C) \"borough council and Hammersmith and\nFulham borough council could mean that\nthey are dealing with the situation more\nefficiently or they haven't got their act\ntogether yet.\nTo follow this line of enquiry, K&C were contacted. They said they would also\n'require all students to produce a copy or\noriginal of their entry certificates'. They\nsaid they were sending out the first of the\nrelevant forms 'at the end of this week'.\nHammersmith and Fulham also said that\nthey needed the poll tax certificate-preferably the original as photocopies\nwere often illegible. This is despite\ngovernment guidelines which state that no\nstudent ought to part with this proof of\nstudentship. The spokeswoman from\nHammersmith and Fulham said that the\ndocuments were only of any use to\ncommunity charge officers, and were not\nuseful to students in any other capacity.\nThe council added that they needed term\ndates as well as names and addresses.\nUnion loses \u00a3300 as office\nis ransacked\nThe union office was ransacked last\nSunday night and \u00a3300 was stolen. The\nbreak-in caused a great deal of disorder\nin tHe office.\nTrie intruders broke in by undetermined\nmeans and attempted to force open the key\ncabinet which holds keys to a number of\nsafes and union facilities. They stole some\nmoney from the office of Mr Dave\nWilliams, Union Deputy President, and\nthen went on to steal \u00a3300 in ten pence\npieces from a desk elsewhere in the office.\nMr Williams said that the money was\nfrom the change machine and games\nmachines in the Union building. It has\nbeen kept in the desk since the safe under\nBeit Arch was removed to 'tidy up' before\nPrincess Anne visited last year. Mr\nWilliams said that there was a rumour that\nthe safe had been dumped in the\nfoundations of the new carpark in front of\nthe Biochemistry buildings.\nThe union is looking into acquiring a larger safe, as Mr Williams claimed that\nthe change would not fit into the present\none. The locks have now been changed,\nand a movement alarm may be fitted in\nthe near future. Mr Williams said that\nsince the beginning of the academic year,\nhe calculated that there had been an\naverage of one theft every three weeks.\nHe added that the fairly high number of\nthefts in the union building was probably\ndue to people knowing the general layout\nof the building.\nIssue 857\nFriday 2nd February\n\n"

    "content": "Retrospect on Rushdie\nThe 'Satanic Affair' is now well into its second year,\nand Salman Rushdie has just entered his second year\nof hiding. Neither side (the Muslim world, nor Rushdie\nand his publishers, Penguin) has shown any sign of\ncompromising.\nThe problem is ultimately of cultural conflict-people in the west and people in the Muslim world\nsimply have very different values. Each has its own,\ndistinct outlook on life. Even in today's 'global village'\nthere is a massive gap in the attitudes of the western\nperson and those of the Muslim one. What someone\nin the west might regard as tolerant, progressive or\nliberal could easily be seen to be simply wrong,\nimmoral and yes, even satanic by the Muslims.\nFor the west, the question the whole affair raises\nis whether Salman Rushdie (or indeed anyone else)\nhas the right to express his or her views under such\npressure from a large part of the world. Freedom of\nexpression is a key issue in western philosophy.\nHowever this freedom has never (not even today)\nbeen granted totally\u2014Voltaire was deemed to be\nblasphemous, DH Lawrence immoral, James Joyce\nprobably both (his work wasn't published here until\nyears after it had appeared on the continent). So it\nwould seem that even one of the most fundamental\n'beliefs' of the western world is subject to social\nsensibilities, dogma and prejudice-it is hardly well\ndefined or clear cut. Thus in our age of disbelief The\nSatanic Verses seems tame enough. However, the\nstory might have been very different, if we were at\nthe beginning of the century and the subject matter\nof the Satanic Verses had been Christianity. The same\nmoral dilemma (to publish or to not to publish, feed om or suppression) would probably have received quite\nthe opposite response. So our own moral outlook has\nchanged dramatically in just a few decades. Is it\nsurprising then, that a large number of people coming\nfrom a very different faith, civilisation or history, living\nin another part of the world hold beliefs contrary to\nours? Surely not. And if there is a clash of beliefs how\nshould the time-bomb be defused?\nThe Islamic world has never had much experience\nwith anti-religious literature. What little has been\nwritten, tended to be heavily veiled, so that the anti-Islamic interpretation could be easily ignored. What\nSalman Rushdie has done is to make an entry so\ndramatic that it has set the Muslim world aflame.\nIslam teaches its followers that God, Allah, and His\nprophet, Mohammed, are the core of a Muslim's life.\nThey must be placed above everything else, including\none's own life-Islam must be defended to the death.\nIt is this sense of faith which has forced Salman\nRushdie into hiding (that in itself being a kind of victory\nfor the Muslims). Islam is a powerful, dynamic religion.\nIt was never apathetic or static-even at its birth it\nwas preparing for conquests.\nAt present both sides seem as inflexible as each\nother. Personally, I bele ive there is room for\ncompromise, if humanity wants to live with itself there\nhas to be. I feel this way probably because I am part\nof the 'confused generation' which is part of both\ncultures-both east and west.\nUnfortunately this view is not a widely held one. It\nis unlikely that anyone will give way in the near future.\nThe best we can hope for is that the Rushdie/Muslim\ntime bomb will defuse by itself, after a long enough\npassage through its sad history.\nI Hussain, Maths UG.\nCompetition\nThis week's competition is to guess what the object\npictured here is for. There is a \u00a35 prize for the closest\nanswer. If we receive more than one correct entry,\nthe winner will be drawn from the hat. Entries should\nbe handed into the FELIX Office by 2.30pm today. In\nthe event of nobody guessing the object's use\ncorrectly, there will be a prize for the most amusing\nuse suggested.\nPage 13\n\n"

The Imperial\nteam performed consistently throughout the day\ndespite working under great pressure to organise the\nracing at the same time as competing.\nStrong winds on the second day forced the team\nracing for the finals to be abandoned, and more\nadventurous sailors ventured onto the water at Queen\nMary SC in City's Laser 2s for some seriously fast and\nvery wet sailing.\nThe final results were therefore calculated on the\nbasis of points scored in League matches on day one.\n1 st (Joint): Bristol and Southampon\n3rd: Swansea\nFilmS oc This Thursday IC FilmSoc is sh wo ing the most\ncontroversial film of last year, The Accused. Jodie\nFoster gives a harrowing performance as a girl who\nis violently raped in a bar and who goes on to\nprosecute not only her assailants, but also the\ncustomers who stood and cheered during the assault.\nKelly Top Gun McGillis is equally good as the put upon\nattorney assigned to defend her.\nIt is a powerful film, pulling no punches as to\nFoster's plight both during and after the rape and\nindeed the film climaxes with a flashback to the crime\nitself which is shown in graphic detail. I defy anyone\nto come away from seeing this, unmoved.\nWine i) We'd like to start this weekly piece by congratulating\nKatie for correctly identifying five out of eight mystery\nwines during last week's Blind Tasting. We're sure\nthat she'll enjoy (or has enjoyed!) her prize: ch. Grand\nPuy Ducasse '84, a classed growth from Pauillac,\nBordeaux.\nThis Tuesday's event was a tasting of red wines\nfrom one of the oldest wine producing regions in\nFrance; the Rhone Valley. Oddbins supplied wines\nranging from the light and fruity \u00a32.49 Cotes du\nRhone '88 to the \u00a311.99 Cornas ' 8 4 - a deep and\ntanni c wine which will continue to improve for at least\nanother five years; a wise investment in one bottle\nwas made by Union Deputy President Dave Williams.\nThis week's favourite, though, was Paul Jaboulet\nAine's Crozes-Hermitage '87 costing a mere \u00a34.39.\nKeep an eye out for posters advertising next week's tasting and for the Valentine Special Champagne and\nSparkling Wine Tasting on February 13. Don't miss\nthe forthcoming cross-channel booze-cruise at the end\nof term; see Lynda Matthews, Chem Eng 4, for\ndetails.\nCHEERS!\nRag The next Rag event this term is the Winged Fellowship\nCollection tomorrow in London. Winged Fellowship\nare a charity that helps disabled people, their main\noperation is to provide special holidays for them.\nCome to the Rag Meeting this lunchtime in the Union\nLounge to find out more.\n'Son of Rag Week' will be from February 13 to 17\nand there will be Milk Tray deliveries and Barbershopa-grams will happen around Valentine's Day and there\nwill be a love Bar Quiz' on the night of the 14th.

    "content": "Grovel\nDear Dave,\nYour editorial in last week's FELIX made certain\ncomments about the Alternative Prospectus which I find very worrying. To begin with, you say that the\nRector is 'very naive' to believe that the AP is honest\nstudent opinion. Well, the exact reason for producing\nan AP is to form a supplement to the College\nProspectus from the students' point of view, so the\nRector is perfectly entitled to think it is so. To say that\nthe AP is not achieving that, is to cast doubts as to\nwhether it is worthwhile producing it at all.\nYou justify this by saying that 'the AP is written by\nDepartmental Representatives under the watchful eye\nof the Senior Tutors'. I was responsible as the Maths\nDep Rep for producing last year's AP entry and I can\nassure you that your allegation is quite false. I had the\nfreedom to write whatever I felt was necessary, and\nthis I did after consultation with all the reps in the\ndepartment.\nThe incident you refer to two years ago when\ndepartments 'slammed down' on the 'truth' occurred\nonly because the AP contained factual inaccuracies,\nand was nowhere near as dramatic as you seem to\nmake out.\nLast year's Academic Affairs Committee put a lot\nof time and effort into producing an accurate and\nrepresentative AP and it hurts to see you brush all that\naway in a single paragraph.\nAthos Ritsperis, ICU Academic Affairs Officer.\nReply:\nI wonder how the editor of last year's AP feels as\nyou brush him away. Ramin Nakisa spent most\nof last year's Easter holiday producing the AP and\na lot of time before pestering Dep Reps for\narticles. As an editor he performed admirably, but\nthere is a limitation to what is possible with the\nmaterial provided.\nI still affirm that the AP can never give a true\npicture whilst it is produced by current students.\nThis year's supplement will probably be produced\nby Neil McCluskey and I shall be only too glad to\nassist him. We, after all, have nothing to lose.\nAs for your comments on the AP supplement\ntwo years ago: the departments complained of\n'factual inaccuracies'. Funnily enough they took\noffense to the editor's personal feelings as well.\nYour comments in this area make me wonder who\nyou represented as Dep Rep: the students or your\ndepartment?\nPraise him\nDear Dave,\nAmong all the excitement of last week's UGM, the\nhigh point for most there must have been the wonders\nof Emmanual Saradakis' speech for the motion of\nvoluntary membership of the NUS, as far as I can\nremember. Anyhow due to the poor attendance at\nUGMs I feel his eloquence may be more appreciated\nat Speakers Corner. I hope he and those who know\nhim see this letter and encourage him to do so, as\nSpeakers Corner could do with a change from the\nusual religious nuts there. Finally has Emmanual any\nplans to stand for a sabbatical, as he shows great\ninterest in ICU affairs?\nPlease, please, please could you allow him to write\na reply to this as many of his fans are missing the great\ninsight his comment brings to matters.\nYours,\nChris Browne, Elec Eng Dep Rep.\nPage 18\nKnight\ntakes pawn\nDear Dave,\nShould/could one employ post graduate students in\nthe Careers Library? I do not so much want to argue\nthis specific case as to explore the wider issue. But\nlet us stay with that library for a moment. Of course,\na pg cannot replace a professional trained information\nofficer. But many of the tasks in the library do not\nrequire any great depth of specialist knowledge. There\nare letters to write; literature to catalogue; bins to be\nfilled with company- literature; there is a policing\nfunction-video tapes have been known to walk;\ntelephones to answer; students need to be directed\nto the appropriate file to deposit application forms; etc\netc....These tasks have to be done. If they are done\nby ancillaries it leaves more time for career advisers\nto advise.\nWhy caricature the concept? Obviously a pg should\nnot do such a job for more than one session per week.\nBut five hours can be found even, in the high powered\nfrenetic research life which is essential for success.\nThe rates of pay can be commensurate with the\nresponsibility of the task. Post graduate students are\nless experienced than their elders-of course. But in\nmy experience they can often see a problem from a new angle-suggest new approaches; they can\nprovide enthusiasm and commitment.\nWe will explore further whether the Careers Library\ncan gain from their second ment. I am convinced that\nmore generally, the College could gain enormously\nfrom a greater use of student help.\nYours,\nEric A Ash.\nWhy oh\nWyatt?\nDear Dave,\nIt is disturbing that students in general fail to\nconsider the i direct or 'invisible' effects of their\nactions. For example, when assessing loans against\ngrants, few even consider the fact that under grants,\ntax-payers on average income sub sid is e the costs of\nhigh-flying students, when they themselves received\nno direct benefit from Higher Education. The real\ndebate must be: 'Are the social costs of grants worth\ntheir benefit to the country as a whole?' To choose\ngrants over loans for short-term financial reasons is\nat best selfish and inconsiderate.\nOf even more current importance is the proposed\nACC motion on ICU paying all sports travel expenses.\nThe motivation for this is purely selfish and takes no\naccount of where the money is to come from, namely\nnon-sports societies. Disproportionate amounts of\nICU's \u00a3200,000 budget for clubs and societies\nalready go to sports activities. Sports clubs have\nadded benefits of capital resources, most notably the\nsports centre. Should they receive even more money\nat the expense of their fellow students? Did the\nproposer of the motion even consider this?\nYours sincerely,\nThomas Wyatt, Maths 2.\nImperial is\na con\nDear FELIX,\nRe: Last week's letter from the Rector.\nThe Rector must count himself the luckiest man in\nthe College today as he surely spends nothing of his\ntime actually finding out what it is like to be a student\nat IC. He may like to ponder as he struggles over his\npennies whether his hallowed institution is what he\nthinks it is.\nThe fact is, that on subjective evidence gathered\nwhile studying here, Imperial is failing miserably to live\nup to the expectations of the undergraduate\npopulation. There seems to be a general malaise, a cloud of despair that lingers whenever the\nconversation turns to College life. And nobody can\never identify what the problem is. But it will not go\naway.\nVarious accusations have been launched at 'the\nCollege' and 'the Department'. The claim that the\nwork is too voluminous does not wash, in my view.\nI have friends at Oxford and Cambridge where the\nworkload is higher and more rigorously applied: there\nis no lack of enthusiasm for College life there,\nhowever.\nThe dullness of the lecturing, the obsessive\n'cleverness' of the problem sheets (certainly in\nElectrical Engineering), the complete 'unreality'\ncharacteristic of lab work that we are subjected to:\nthese are all contributory factors.\nBut what really gets up my nose is people in\npositions of authority pretending the undergraduate\npopulation are here to be trampled upon and pushed\naround freeing up vital resources for money-spinning\nopportunities. The result is a group of very intelligent,\nvery talented people who have seen their dreams\ncrumble to dust-wasted opportunities, every single\none of them. For me it is criminal. To recruit some of\nthe most gifted students in the country, and once they\nare here, pretend that it was all a big joke. 'We were\nonly kidding-we didn't actually mean that this was\na University. It is just a repository for lost dreams. If\nyou would queue on the left, hand your dream to the\ncashier, and we will give you a degree in return. And\nplease don't enjoy yourself. If you want to do that,\nwell you can just fuck off.' The sad result of studying\nat Imperial College is disillusionment, cynicism and an\noverwhelming desire never to have anything to do\nwith science or engineering again. Anyone who tells\nyou otherwise is either lying through their teeth or\nthey are visiting the metaphorical brothel around the\ncorner.\nYours sincerely,\nName withheld at editor's discretion.\nIgnorant\nbigots\nDear Dave,\nWe are told that the NUS are a collection of small-minded, ignorant bigots too self-obsessed to even\nrealise the outside world exists.\nIC would have fitted in so well.\nYours,\nJason Lander.\n\n"

    "content": "SUR\nOn leaving the cinema I thought; what the hell was\nthat about? The film had no form, was not shown in\nchronological order; it was an amorphous mess.\nHowever on reflection my views changed.\nSUR won the best director's award at the 1988\nCannes Film Festival. Director Fernando Solanas has\ntaken a familiar plot and presented it in an entirely\nunique way. This is not a 'mass-produced formula'\nfilm, at no time does one get a sense of deja vu.\nSUR is set in 1983, just at the end of Argentina's military dictatorship. Floreal, who had been locked up\nfor subversive activities, is liberated after having\nserved five years. Although Floreal wants to return\nhome to his wife and son, he is not ready to face\nthem. So much has changed, and he is too full of\nmust rust, hate and fear.\nDuring Floreal's imprisonment, his wife Rosi had\nbeen through her own hell, and in her desperation had\nbecome the lover of his best friend, Roberto, a Corsican, who had found friendship and purpose in\nArgentina.\nThrough a long night's journey into day, Floreal\nwanders through the dreamlike streets of the\nneighbourhood, which are strewn with banners and\nleaflets celebrating the return of democracy. As he\nwalks, he meets ghosts of his past who help him\nrecollect the moments, and people, of the years that\nmarked his broken life.\nSUR is divided into chapters, a prologue and four\nparts. Each stands seperate ly, but together they form\na masterpiece. Through these chapters echoes a feeling of finding one's self, Argentina finding itself\nafter years of oppression, for the tra ingle of main\ncharacters represents Argentina, not just three people.\nIt is interesting to note that during filming the director\nsuffered major kidney failure. This personal brush with\ndeath shows through in SUR.\nThe ending is left open to personal interpretations.\nPerhaps Floreal/Argentina have come to terms with\nthe changes around them and overcome the fear and\nhatred within themselves. However I believe Floreal\ndies in prison. In his journey into the past he meets\npeople who are dead but act as if they were living,\nso perhaps Floreal, although apparently alive, is dead.\nBut why not go to the film and draw your own\nconclusions?\nIf you're looking forward to Police Academy 7 and\nthink that Lee Majors is a talented actor then don't bother to see this movie. However, if you enjoy\nthought provoking fresh films then SUR is for you.\nSUR opens at the Canon premiere, Swiss Centre,\nLeicester Square on Friday February 2.\nCharles Tomkins\nJesus of Montreal Lock up\nThis film caused a storm when it appeared at Cannes\n(where, incidentally, it won the Jury Prize). This was\ndespite being, or more probably because it was, a deeply religious film: an actor (Lothare Bluteau) is\nbrought in to revamp the Passion play that is annually\nperformed at a Catholic shrine in Montreal.\nHe gathers together a sorry group of actors,\ncurrently working as a prostitute, doing voice overs\nfor blue movies and lousy documentaries, and making\na career as a model in bad commercials. Together they\nrewrite the play, basing it on the latest archaeological\nevidence which has been unearthed by the\nUniversity's theology department. Funded by the\nCatholic church, the department is forced to suppress\nevidence the church finds 'unsuitable'. This includes\nthe possibility that the 'Virgin' Mary was raped by a Roman soldier and that crucifixion was so horrendous\nthat the early church did not portray it for five\ncenturies. Thus the department sees the reworking\nof the play as an opp rt unity to indirectly publish\ncensored facts.\nNaturally, the play, although an artistic success,\ncauses a storm amongst the trustees of the shrine\nwho order the run to be brought to an abrupt end.\nMeanwhile the lives of the actors, in particular\nBluteau, who plays Jesus, begin to mirror those of the\nparts they are playing. At an audition for a lager\nadvert, Bluteau becomes angry at attitude of the self-satisfied casting directors and overturns tables and\nequipment, whilst later, at the top of a skyscraper,\nj smooth lawyer offers him 'the whole city' in return\nfor placing himself in the hands of the media machine.\nMany of the analogies are more subtle than these\ntwo examples (which have been much quoted in\nnewspaper reviews): the priest in charge of the shrine\nregularly visits one of the actresses who sometimes\nworks as a prostitute, the publicity machine (TV and\nradio chat shows) distort and misrepresent the facts\nabout Bluteau's life, and after Bluteau dies the other\nactors are manipulated by the lawyer into founding\na theatre company which will idea lise his life.\nThe film points up the hypocrisies of the followers\nof theatre (repeating the same tired, sugared\ncongratulations at the end of every performance) and\nof the church in rejecting the truth ('What is Truth?'\nasks Pilate in the play).\nThis is a funny, witty film: the part where two\nactresses and one actor dub a blue movie has to be\nthe funniest scene in any film this year (comedies\nincluded). The film is informed, with a sense of life,\nfun, happiness and tragedy which the religion it\ncriticises has clearly forgotten.\nIt is sensuously filmed and an aural treat. Mostly\nin French, the subtitles are excellent and easy to read.\nDenis Arcand has produced a masterpiece. This is one\nof the films of the year and the only surprise is that\nit didn't beat Sex, Lies and Videotape (admittedly also\na good film) for the Palme d 'Orat Cannes.\nLiz W. Frank Leoni is a model prisoner in a cushy gaol. Then,\nwithout warning, with only a few months left to serve,\nhe is transferred to one of the toughest lock-ups in\nthe country.\nThe reason? A sadistic go verner has a grudge\nagainst him.\nWell, Sylvester Stallone has finally found the perfect\nsetting for his type of film. A prison filled entirely with\nmen. There is but a single woman in the whole film\u2014\nhis girlfriend, whose only role is to wait patiently\n'outside' for him, and to be threatened by the 'bad\nguys'. Meanwhile our hero gets to play American\nfootball in the mud, work in a boiler room (a chance\nto show his muscles off, covered in sweat), and have\nlots of good manly fun rebuilding a car. Of course his\ncharacter is a nice chap-he only went to prison for\nbeating up the thugs that beat up a sweet old man.\nMeanwhile the wicked go verner lurks in darkened\nrooms, fondles his electric chair and plots evilly.\nOf course it all comes to a head when one of Sly's friends is killed, and his girlfriend threatened. Then,\nlike any red-blooded American male, our hero rushes\noff for an ending full of self sacrifice, shock\nresurrection, several thousand volts, an electric chair\nand not a few guns.\nThe whole time the only sign of suffering he shows\nis a slight quiver of his top lip-what a man!\nCorny, unoriginal and badly acted. Avoid at all\ncosts.\nAdam T. Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "This\nYjeek\n\u2022 The first successful foetal heart sur very has\nbeen carried out at Guy's Hospital. The operation\ninvolved inserting a balloon into the heart of the foetus\nand inflating it so that its previously blocked aortic\nvalve was cleared. However two operations were\nrequired before birth. On the first attempt the balloon\nburst while inside the heart and is still lodged there\nbut has not yet caused any problems. The second\noperation though was a success and a third operation\nafter the boy was born made sure that the valve was\nfully opened.\n\u2022 The number of homes affected by the build up\nof the radioactive gas, radon, is thought to be three\ntimes as many as previously estimated. This is the\nmain conclusion of a report published last week by\nthe National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB).\nPreviously the NRPB believed that 25,000 houses\nwere affected mainly in areas of granite foundation\nrock such as South West England and North East\nScotland. The new value is said to be 75,000\ndwellings. The gas seeps up through cracks in the\nrocks into houses and accumulates due to better\ndraught proofing and less ventilation in modern\nbuildings. The Board's new estimate follows revised\nmaps charting the presence of the gas however it is\nexaggerated since the action level has been halved.\nThe NRPB says that 2,500 deaths each year from\nlung cancer are directly attributable to inhalation of\nexcessive levels of radon gas. This cause of lung\ncancer is second only to smoking.\n\u2022 An American .consortium set up by seven\ncompanies to manufacture dynamic random access\nmemory (DRAM) chips was abandoned last week.\nTheir intention was to provide computer\nmanufacturers with a viable alternative to the\nJapanese monopoly in this field. The venture failed,\nhowever, after insufficient investment and\ncommitment from the American computer\nmanufacturers to buy the chips.\nMeanwhile IBM still intend to manufacture new high\nmemory integrated circuits with the compact\nsynchrotron, Helios, being built by the British\ncompany Oxford Instruments. This is an electron ring\nproducing X rays which will be used in X ray\nlithography. Most present production techniques rely\non ultraviolet light or electron beams to 'etch' tracks\nand junctions into the silicon. The resolution is\ndependent on the wavelength of the radiation used.\nBy using X rays it is possible to make the circuits\nsmaller and thus of a higher density allowing for larger\nmemory on a single chip.\n\u2022 A new electromagnetic gun test site planned to\nbe situated in Kirkcudbright (in Dumfries and\nGalloway) will be funded jointly by the US Department\nof Defense and a division of the British Ministry of\nDefence. These guns rely on the electromagnetic\nforce acting on an armature, which accelerates it\nalong a conducting barrel to propel a projectile. The\nidea is to develop the technique as an alternative to\nusing explosives since the potential launch speeds are\nfar higher. Scientists working at Fort Halstead have\nbuilt prototypes which have fired a3 mm ball bearing\nat a speed of 4.2km h\"1. It is thought that this type\nof gun could be installed in a tank within ten years.\nConfusion by Simon Haslam\nWater covering the particle accelerator at Sandia National Laboratories discharges electric\nmachine fires its beam towards a fuel pellet.\nWith the ultimate demise of any hopes for room\ntemperature fusion, as proposed by Pons and\nFleischmann in March last year, our attention once\nagain turns to 'hot' fusion.\nFusion takes place when light atoms join together\nwith the resulting nuclei having a lower mass than\ntheir constituents thus releasing energy according to\nEinstein's famous equation Energy = change in mass\nx( speed of light squared). The fuel normally used is\ndeuterium often known as heavy hydrogen since there\nis one extra neutron in the deuterium nucleus than in\nthe hydrogen. Tritium is also used which has two\nextra neutrons in the nucleus and has the ability to\nrelease more binding energy but is very unstable.\nEnviromentally, fusion is far sounder than fission\nwhere large atoms are broken apart. These large\natoms, such as Uranium, tend to be highly radioactive\nfor a long period of time. Although high energy\nneutrons are released by fusion the radioactive nature\nis far less dangerous than fission. The possibility for\nan out of control chain reaction does not occur since\nas soon as the compression of the fuel is lowered\nfusion processes stop.\nThere are currently several methods employed to\nachieve the goal of a controlled fusion reaction. Firstly\nhuge magnetic coils are arranged around a doughnut\nshaped, toroidal vessel, creating a very high magnetic\nfield. Atoms at high temperatures experience such\nhigh thermal energies that the bonds between\nelectrons and protons disassociate, forming a sea of\nelectrons and nuclei known as a plasma. Such a plasma, contained in a high magnetic field can\nundergo fusion processes as significantly energetic\nnuclei combine to form larger ones.\nOne example of an experiment in this area is the\nJoint European Taurus (JET) situated in Abingdon,\nOxford. This is part of the European fusion\nprogramme, which has a budget of \u00a3250m per year.\nJET has cost around \u00a3600m over its 12 year life; a small fraction of these resources.\nSome researchers believe, however, that the first\nobjective should be to build smaller vessels to aim for\n'ignition,' that is to have enough energy produced to\nsustain fusion events; the so called energetic\nbreak even. This energy emission would be orders of\nmagnitude away from what would be required for\neconomic power generation from fusion. The\nlimitation of the Taurus approach is the maximum\nmagnetic field produced by conventional\nelectromagnets today; science needs stronger\nmagnets to contain these plasmas.\nIntertial confinement is also being developed. The\ntechnique involves the compression of a fuel pellet\ncausing an implosion then leading to fusion. One\nmethod used is to fire an intense pulse of laser\nradiation at a tiny capsule of heavy water from all\ndirections. The resulting thermal and electromagnetic\neffects cause the pellet to implode as its shell burns\naway. Such a reactor exists in the Rochester\nLaboratory in America. A neo dy niu m laser produces\n24 beams which are split using lenses and mirrors into\n250,000 individual rays. A pulse of less than 1\nnanosecond (10~9\nseconds) duration causes the\ntemperature of the fuel to rise to between 10 and 50\nmillion degrees. This is only successful and entails\nfusion when the energy density striking the Yt mm\ndiameter capsule varies by less than 1% in all\ndirections. At present this machine can only meet a minimum of 3% variation.\nIn order to make such a reactor viable on a commer ical basis fuel pellets would need to be fed\ncontinuously through the target area several times a second. The power output would then be dependent\non the rate at which fuel pellets were supplied rather\nthan the size of the laser. Present lasers, however,\ncan often only be fired a few times per day otherwise\nthey overheat. High powered, semiconductor lasers\nbuilt from arrays of chips which are not economical\nat the moment, may well be so in the future.\nLasers do have more than one rival as a means of\ninertial confinement. One such case is the use of high\nenergy particle beams. Another American laboratory\nat Sandia has built such a machine (see figure) where\nprotons are focussed onto a spot with an energy\ndensity greater than 1 0 1 6\nWatts per mm2. Many research scientists believe that the first\ncommercial plants will be possible within forty years,\ntwenty years with a concerted effort. They have been\nmaking claims like this ever since the first research\nsome forty years ago.\nAs natural resources become more scarce\nalternative means of power generation will become\nincreasingly necessary and in many respects this will\nbe the fusion establishment's greatest ally.\n\n"

    "content": "Birdland\nSyndrome 18.1.90\nThe Birdland 'Bulldozer' tour rumbled into the\nSyndrome destroying everything destruct able in its\npath and leaving chaos and gratified fans in its wake.\nSo far Birdland's tour of small venues had led to\nmayhem and destruction similar to the early Pistols\ngigs, and the comparison doesn't stop there; The\nPistols attempted to sensational is e by creating scenes\nof mayhem; Birdland in their choice of venues with\nan average capacity of two to three hundred, three\nmonths after a sell-out and extremely lively gig at the\n1,600 capacity Astoria Theatre, was bound to cause\nfrustration amongst fans.\nA cheap rock stunt? Well it worked, didn't it?\nThe support set See Rider were pretentious sods\nwho left after five minutes with problems.\nBirdland walked onstage and the crowd were\nalready in a state of frenzy; within thirty seconds of\nfun, fun, fun all had surged forwards destroying steel\ncrash barriers and almost pushed over the speakers\nbefore arriving largely unscathed, but totally crushed\nat the stage.\nFutile attempts to move the crowd back were\nrendered impossible by the destruction of the barriers,\nwhose only use now was to act as a ramp onto the\nstage.\nA brilliant set, comprising of tracks from singles\nHollow Heart, Paradise and Sleep with Me, plus covers\nlasted about thirty minutes.\nThe band overflowed with energy; Richard directed\nit through his singing, greatly removed from the record\nsound, much more natural, like a Coventry bawl; Kale\nattacked a poor defenceless mike stand and killed it.\nThe Syndrome had escaped relatively lightly and as\nthe band left the venue, staff knelt and prayed for no\nencore, but Birdland, being consumer friendly but\nenvironmentally hostile, bounded back into an encore.\nThe guitar/bass intro spelt trouble, but the cry of\n'This is a Patti Smith so ooo ng' drove it home.\nEveryone lost their heads including the band, Richard\nalso lost his shirt and Kale his guitar somewhere in\nthe drum kit!\nTwas a classic-you just had to be there...\nWhite Zombie\n-God of Thunder 12\"\nAfter the promise of 'a powerful blend of soul crushing\ngrunge' they slip back into the oblivion of heavy\nAmerican rock leaving only disappointment in their\nwork.\nTheir sound is unoriginal, the song is....what song?\nThey shout a few words, moan a few and as a token\ngesture grunge a few on the last track.\nNever do they face their music and attack it with\na whole-hearted attitude such as other grunge metal\nbands like Killer or Napalm Death.\nIn the space of fifteen minutes while they redefine\nthe word tedious, they also try other clich es and\nuseless gimmicks such as a vain attempt at\nseriousness or climax ic noises in the background.\nOnly for the brain dead or soon to become.\nThe Right Stuff\n-The Girls All Go 12\"\nWell this record just comes at you - roll beat first, then\nrock vocals, rock lyrics, rock chant, rock guitar riffs\nand the ever complementing backing 'ooo ooh' s'; being the 'Ipcress Mix' just makes it painfully longer.\nHaving decided it is a commercial rock record just\nabout says it all.\nOn the flip side it changes from pop rock to bluesy\nrock, reminiscent of U2 (ie crap lyrics) but at least\nBono's voice is (was?) more suited. Whether bad\nmixing is to blame or not the track is sparse and at\ntimes almost devoid of any evident motivation.\nThe final track Song for Blind Alley makes it all\nworthwhile; though still sparse, a mellow guitar is\nmore evident, showing an evident vocation for mellow\nrock. Even the final track doesn't make up for the first\ntwo, but if they continue in a direction as shown in\nSong For Blind Alley then there is hope yet.\nThey might....but might n't... Skid R6w-18+ Life 12\"\nJust another American rock record, you could, if you\nstrayed far enough, find it anywhere in the American\ncharts, it's all the same 'inn it? The first two tracks are the same really...I wouldn't tell them apart and probably wouldn't care. But then...\nA pretentious live speech between tracks on the\nflipside displays the misplaced power of rock music\nas Sebastian Balm, lead egotistical brainless moron,\ngets the crowd to chant 'fuck you' as a retort in the\nface of a conflict of opinions.\nThey follow this with a sorry revel in their own\narrogance; you can almost see their egos grow as the\ncrowd responds.\nAn American rock record gone sour.\nFur's Winner\nThe winner of the Psychedelic Furs competition was\nJames Joyce from Aero I. The answers were:\n1. Which two members of the band are brothers and\nwhat do they play?\nTim Butler-Bass\nRichard 'Rep' Butler-Vocals\n2. Who designed the cover of the band's first album?\nAndy Warhol\nTie Break: How many singles have the Psychedelic\nFurs released since they formed?\n14\nHe will receive two tickets for the Psychedelic Furs\nconcert at Brixton Academy on Feb 6.\nYour trusty FELIX music pages have\ntaken a turn to the indie of late, due to\nthe fact that the new music editor is an\nindie pop/thrash mad banana and likes\nto got to loud indie gigs, slam dance,\nstage dive and many other homy\nthings.\nDo you want to see your music pages\nwallow in indie pop forever? If not say\nsomething or do something.\nFree tickets, free records and the title\n'apprentice FELIX rock jour no' will all\nbe yours and more!\nContact Del in the FELIX Office.\n\n"
