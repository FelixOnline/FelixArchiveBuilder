He demonstrates\na psychological depth that\nlater found more relevance during the advent of\npsychoanalysis, at which\npoint he was recognised\nas \u201cthe first Italian painter\nwho was sensitive to\nthe varying states of the\nhuman soul\u201d by Bernard\nBerenson (1895), who\nrefamiliarized the public\nwith Lotto. There\u2019s a\nuniversality about his\nworks, such as Portrait\nof a Woman Inspired by\nLucrezia, reminiscent of\nmodern feminism, with\nthe sitter confidently challenging powerful social\nnorms of virtue and purity.\nThe fact that this is the\nfirst dedicated showing\nof Lotto\u2019s works in the\nNational Gallery is truly\na mystery, as will become\napparent when you walk\naround the three rooms\nthat comprise it. There\nare physical examples\nof objects resembling\nthose from the paintings\ndisplayed in glass cases\naround the rooms. They\nadmittedly don\u2019t really\nadd much; observing the\nway things are painted\nin Lotto\u2019s style is what\u2019s\nimportant, but since they\ndon\u2019t take away from the\nexhibition itself either I\ndidn\u2019t really mind.\nHowever, what the\nexhibition does do is\nunite many of his most\nimportant portraits in one\nplace, to demonstrate his\ndistinctive and innovative\nstyle. This style seems to\nbe an amalgamation of his\nown inventiveness and influences from his travels.\nThough born and trained\nin Venice, he spent time in\nsmaller cities like Treviso,\nwhich was located on the\nGerman trade route. Being\nexposed to techniques\nnorth of the Alps, Lotto\nfused his more traditional\nVenetian painting with\nGerman practices of crisp\nrendering and attention to\ndetail to develop a style\nunique to him. He also\ntravelled to Bergamo,\nbreathing a refreshing\nvitality and humour into\nhis works, along with\nmuch more experimen-tation. For example, he\nbegan using wide landscape format canvases to\nallow double matrimonial\nportraits, and later even\nexperimented with triple\nportraits showing various\nangles of one face.\nLotto expertly manages\nto portray the personalities\nof the sitters in the way\nthat they are dressed, their\nexpressions, and their surroundings in the painting,\ntelling a story using witty\nand sophisticated symbol-ism. Five hundred years\nhave not yet quashed the\ncaptivating personalities\nbehind the eyes of the\nsitters, which, unusually\nfor the time, are pointed\ndirectly at the viewer. I\nappreciated the way you\ncan exercise your brain\nin searching the portraits\nfor clues about the personalities and lives of the\nsitters \u2013 notice how a fly\nrests on the handkerchief\nof an elderly physician, a\nreminder of his mortality;\nnotice how the hand of a\nyoung man rests on the\ntable amongst scattered\nrose and jasmine petals,\na symbol of love and\npurity. The layout of the\nexhibition allows us to\nnotice the subtle interplay\nbetween his portraits,\nsuch as the connection\nbetween the sitter of\nthe first portrait, Bishop\nBernardo de\u2019 Rossi, and\nthe deposed queen of\nCyprus who plays the\nVirgin in another portrait\nin the same room.\nPeople are often\ndubious about free exhibitions at well-known\ngalleries, as they think it\nmay lack the grandeur or\nquality of a ticketed one.\nIn all honesty, I was rather\nshocked that they made\nthis one free. Having been\nto both free and more\nexpensive exhibitions at\nthe National Gallery, I\ncan assure you that you\u2019ll\nleave feeling astounded at\nthe shockingly incredible\nvalue for (no) money!\nLucky for you, there\u2019s\nplenty of time to catch\nLorenzo Lotto Portraits,\nas it\u2019s running until\nmid-February 2019.\nOften overshadowed by his contemporaries, Lorenzo Lotto\u2019s time has finally come in a rediscovery of the\nwonderfully idiosyncratic works of this Venetian painter.\nLotto\u2019s Portrait of Andrea Odoni\nISSUE 1705\nFELIX\n27\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nShivani Gangadia\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Two years of\nrenovation on the ground\nfloor introduced individual and group study spaces,\nthe Wolfson IT Learning\nSuite, and the opening of\nthe Library Caf\u00e9. Prior to\nPhase 1, the ground floor\nhad housed a Waterstones,\nthe Science Museum\nLibrary, and the Haldane\nCollection (the Central\nLibrary\u2019s humanities\ncollection). The Science\nMuseum Library was\nmoved to level 2, but was\neventually evicted in 2015\nafter a Level 2 Development project that created\nnew student study spaces.\nTemperature control\nhas been a long-standing\nissue for library users.\nStudents repeatedly complained about the lack of\nventilation in the library,\na matter that became\nespecially pressing during\nsummer exam seasons.\nAmid declining NSS\nratings, the College began\nPhase 2 in July 2017, to\naddress these issues.\nIn November 2017,\nthe library installed new\ncooling systems on levels\n4 and 5. Floors were refurbished and power sockets\nadded to all desks. The\nconstruction work was\nhandled by the College\u2019s\nEstates Development &\nProjects team, which also\nmanaged construction\nof the Prince\u2019s Gardens\nresidences in 2009 and\nthe Putney Boathouse in\n2014.\nThis summer, climate\ncontrol systems were\nbrought to levels 2 and\n3, along with floor refur-bishment, power at all\ndesks, and new PCs and\nfurniture. The Central\nLibrary now houses over\n350 student-use PCs.\nIn June 2017, Felix\nrevealed that the new\ncooling system installed\nin the past two years cost\n\u00a311 million, the Central\nLibrary\u2019s single largest\nexpenditure in over a\ndecade. The Phase 1\nrefurbishments cost the\nLibrary \u00a310.4 million; this\nwas funded by College,\nthe Wolfson Foundation,\nand the Lisbet Rausing\nTrust.\nNew group study area at Imperial College Central Library // Twitter: @imperiallibrary\nCentral Library re-opens Group Study Space\nAndy Djaba \u2013 Felix Editor\nFRIDAY, 16TH\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\nEDITORIAL\nThe Felix Team\nEditor-in-Chief\nAndy Djaba\n\u2022\nDeputy Editor\nJoanna Wormald\n\u2022\nNews Editors\nJoanna Wormald\nFrank Leggett\n\u2022\nPolitics Editors\nAvirup Banerjee\nDivyen Vanniasegaram\nJuan Rubio Gorrochategui\n\u2022\nComment Editors\nAida Manzano Kharman\nCharlie Titmuss\n\u2022\nScience Editors\nRosie Dutt\nEyad Abuelgasim\nHenry Alman\nS\u00e2nziana Foia\n\u2022\nTech Editor\nKrithika Balaji\nHaaris Asghar\n\u2022\nArts Editors\nClaire Chan\nHelen Money-Kyrle\nVaishnavi Gnanananthan\n\u2022\nBooks Editors\nJJ Cheng\n\u2022\nMusic Editors\nSimran Kukran\nAdrian LaMoury\nHenry Eshbaugh\nAsad Raja\n\u2022\nFilm Editors\nMikhail Demtchenko\nSung Soo Moon\nAidan Chan\n\u2022\nMarkets Editor\nTom Alston\n\u2022\nFood Editors\nEva Tadros\nJulia D\u0105browska\n\u2022\nPuzzles Editor\nLisa Hey\nLorenzo Silvestri\n\u2022\nSports Editor\nImraj Singh\nFergus Johnson\n\u2022\nHead Photographer\nJoe O'Connell-Danes\n\u2022\nCopy Editors\nRhidian Thomas\nCalum Drysdale\nJia Tan\nIsabelle Zhang\nCONTENTS\nEDITORIAL\nNEWS\nPOLITICS\nCOMMENT\nSCIENCE\nTECH\nBOOKS\nMUSIC\nFILM\nFOOD\nARTS\nGAMES\nLIBERATION\nC&S\nINVESTMENT\nHANGMAN\nPUZZLES\nSPORTS\n2\n3-5\n6\n7-9\n10\n11\n13\n14-16\n17\n18-19\n22-27\n28-30\n31\n34\n35\n36-37\n38\n39-40\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort\nRoad\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nfelixonline.co.uk\n@feliximperial\nPrinted by Mortons Media\nGroup, Boston Road,\nHorncastle, Lincolnshire\nRegistered Newspaper\nISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2017\nUntitled Unmastered\nI\nt's currently 11pm on\nThursday night and I\ncan'tthinkofatitlefor\nthis editorial; hence,\nUntitled Unmastered.

Anyway, for\nthose who don't know, I'm\na Kendrick Lamar stan.\nAsk me to write about\nKendrick and I'll write\nyou a thesis. Ask me to\nwrite an editorial and I'm\nfucked...\nThe more astute readers\namonst you will notice\nthat this is, in fact, the\nearliest I've written my\neditorial. That's right, we\nhave smashed last week's\nrecord by a whopping 30\nminutes! I'm currently on\ncourse to submitting the\npaper only slightly after\nthe official print 'deadline'.\nWhat can I say? We just\nkeep getting better. The\nboy is back.\nThis week's issue of\nFelix was accompanied\nby the sad news of Professor James Stirling's tragic\npassing. As he retired\nbefore I took up my\nposition, I never had the\npleasure of meeting Professor Stirling. However,\nthrough speaking to staff\nand students that knew\nhim and colleagues that\nworked closely with him,\nit is abundantly clear\nwhat a caring individual\nhe was. He was evidently\na genuinely nice man\nand I pray that he rests\nin peace. The article I've\nwritten includes heartfelt\ntributes from many of the\nformer Officer Trustees\nwho worked closely with\nhim and have all echoed\nsimilar sentiments.\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you! We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, report-ers, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed \u2013 we\u2019ll teach\nyou everything you need to know. If you\u2019re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk\nThis week's issue also\nincludes news about an\nexciting new partnership\nbetween Imperial and\nThe Times. There will be\nincreased communication\nabout this collaboration in\nthe coming weeks and, as\npart of that, you will see\nme quoted as saying the\nfollowing:\n\"We have a lot of very\nengaged, switched on\nstudents here who are\nenthusiastic about jour-nalism. Having the opportunity to work with the\nTimes to understand issues\naffecting journalism today\nis a great opportunity. The\nambassador scheme, and\nhaving access to some of\nthe UK\u2019s best journalists,\nwill all help. We are going\nthrough a period when real\nnews and real expertise\nare under a lot of threat, so\nthis partnership comes at\na particularly appropriate\nmoment.\"\nThis statement was\ndefinitely written by me\nand not provided to me\nby someone in the Communications team (I am\nAndy Djaba and I approve\nthis message). In all seri-ousness, this partnership\nrepresents a wonderful\nopportunity and a dedication to student journalism\nat Imperial so come along\nto the launch event in\nSAF G16 from 17:30 to\n19:00 on Tuesday 27th\nNovember.\nFinally, I want to end\nthis editorial by giving\na brief overview of my\nweek. I had an interview\non Monday (I have to\nenter the \"real world\"\nafter this 'job' of course)\nand I was, naturally, asked\nabout leadership and my\ncurrent role. I thought of\nhow best to keep the editorial team motivated and\nI had my eureka moment:\n\"Andy's Section of the\nWeek Awards\". Every\nweek I will reward the\nbest section. This week's\nwinner: ARTS! Congratulations and see you at\ntomorrow's social!\nNas Andriopoulos,\nwho served as Union\nPresident in 2016/17, also\npaid tribute to Professor\nStirling, saying:\n\"I had the privilege and\nhonour of working with\nhim for just a year but, in\nthat period, I witnessed\nthe dedication he showed\nfor the lives of students\nat Imperial and a unique\ncompassion with which\nhe led. One quality that\nstands out to me above all\nothers, is that he possessed\nan unusual caring for\nevery student at Imperial.\nWe should all mourn the\nloss of this great man and I\nhope we can celebrate his\nlegacy in the years ahead.\nMy deepest sympathies\nare with Paula [Professor\nStirling's wife], James\u2019\nfamily and friends \u2013 I\nknow he will be remembered with great fondness\nby the organisation he\nserved with such dedication and distinction.\"\nFinally, Nick Burstow,\nwhowaslastyear'sDeputy\nPresident (Education),\nextended his condolences:\nIf you have read anything about the death of\nProfessor James Stirling\nover the last few days, you\nwill see references to his\nacademic achievements;\nhis Fellowship of the\nRoyal Society; and his\ncontinued efforts to\nimprove the wellbeing\nof staff at Imperial. But\nwhat has not been mentioned in as much depth\nas is deserved was his\ndedication to students.\nHis dedication to us.\nI had the pleasure of\nworking with Professor\nStirling last year, when\nI served as your Deputy\nPresident (Education). In\nevery meeting I shared\nwith him, he always\nasked for the student\nview on matters. For\nour view on matters. No\nmatter how high-level\nthe committee, he treated\nthe student view as equal\nto that of staff.\nFor someone who occupied such an important\nposition, Professor Stirling was down-to-earth,\napproachable, and totally\ncommitted to improving\nthings for students.\nProfessor Stirling also\nleft a lasting impression on\nme personally. As every\nDeputy President (Edu-cation) before and after\nme will tell you, the first\ntime representing your\nfellow 18,000 students\nat a high-level College\ncommittee can be daunt-ing. But Professor Stirling\nalways took the trouble to\nmake me, and my fellow\nDPEs, feel at ease and\ninvolved in discussions.\nWhen I started my post\nlast year, he asked to meet\nthe Union\u2019s five Officer\nTrustees to discuss our\nplans for the year ahead.\nWhen we met with him,\nhe had already learnt our\nnames, read our manifes-tos, and knew our main\ngoals for the year. That\nwas the kind of man he\nwas.\nAs Professor Stirling\u2019s\ncolleagues mourn his\npassing, I think it is only\nright that we students acknowledge and celebrate\nsomeone who dedicated\nthe last years of their\nworking life to improving\nacademia at Imperial. Professor Stirling will be remembered by many as the\nfirst Provost of Imperial,\nbut he will be remembered\nfor so much more by the\npeople fortunate enough\nto have known him.\"\nAll those at Imperial\nwill continue to celebrate\nall that Professor Stirling\nachieved in his life and\ncherish the memories of\nhis wisdom, grace, and\nwarmth. There will be an\nopportunity for the Imperial community to gather\nin celebration of his life\nand accomplishments,\ndetails for which will be\nannounced very soon.\n\n"

What is it like to\ninhabit a world of silence\nand darkness? In their\nimmersive performance\npiece Imagined Touch,\ndeafblind artists Heather\nLawson and Michelle\nStevens seek to open up to\naudiences their world \u2013 a\nworld which most of us\nhave never even considered before.\nThe performance accommodates perhaps 15\npeople at a time. We are\nhanded vision-obscuring\ngoggles and headphones\nand shepherded down,\nsingle file, into The Pit, a\nperformance space at the\nBarbican. None of this\nhelps my sense of trepi-dation. When Imagined\nTouch first premiered\nin Melbourne in 2016,\nLawson and Stevens spent\nan hour with the audience\nbefore the immersive\nexperience, telling stories\nabout themselves. Here,\nwe have only a short introductory film featuring\nthe two artists.\n\u201cBefore you enter our\nworld, you must learn its\nrules,\u201d says Stevens, \u201cbut\nalways know that you are\nsafe. You are safe.\u201d I feel\noddly comforted by her\nstatement as I put on the\ngoggles and headphones.\nEverything goes foggy\nand the soundscape of\na busy train station fills\nmy ears. How frightening\nwould it be if my vision\nremained like this perma-nently? Surely no such\nguarantee of safety exists\nfor the deafblind as they\ngo about their daily life.\nJust as I muse this to\nmyself, someone takes\nmy hand and pulls me\nonward. A threshold\nappears beneath my feet\nand I stumble gracelessly\nacross it into\u2026 an open\nspace? My guide leaves\nme and I panic. Do I\ndare take a step forward?\nShadowy figures brush\npast me and I am tempted\nto grab onto one of them\nand ask for help. The\nlights go out and my vision\nchanges from foggy white\nto pitch blackness.\nInvisible hands lead\nme to a chair. A strange\nsequence of taps and\nstrokes is signed into my\nhand, and then a piece\nof paper appears out of\nnowhere. I touch it and\nfeel the rough texture. It\nmust spell something in\nBraille, but I have no idea\nhow to read it, or if I am\neven moving across the\npaper in a straight line.\nWhich way is up? I\u2019m\nashamed to admit I have\nabsolutely no idea people\ncommunicate without\nspeech or sight.\nI am passed from one\nperson to another and\ndanced around the room.\nMy confidence grows.\nI even do a little twirl!\nFinally, a rectangle is\ndrawn on my back and\nfingers walk in a straight\nline up it. Go through the\ndoor, I think. Through\nthe goggles I sense dimly\na rectangle of darkness\nin front of me, but I\u2019m\nscared to step through.\nSuddenly, loud laughter\n(is it mocking?) echoes\nfrom behind me. Hands\ngrab me and pull me\nthrough, confused, back\ninto reality.\nImagined Touch tries\nits best to show audiences what it\u2019s like to\nlive life as a deafblind\nperson, and for the most\npart succeeds. But the\n20-minute installation\nfeels very short, and I\u2019m\nleft vaguely disoriented,\nwith more questions than\nanswers. The soundscape\nby Madeleine Flynn and\nTim Humphrey is beautifully crafted \u2013 a busy train\nstation, the pitter-patter\nof rain \u2013 but why not\nsilence, if we are meant\nto be both deaf and blind?\nHow does tactile sign\nlanguage work? Some\nsort of post-performance\ndiscussion or even another\nshort film from Lawson\nand Stevens would have\nbeen appreciated. After\nthe (rather abrupt) ending\nto the performance, my\nprimary feeling is one\nof relief at rejoining the\nworld of the sighted. I\u2019m\nnot entirely sure I\u2019ve\ngained much more insight\ninto what it\u2019s like to be\ndeafblind.\nThe room at Jermyn\nStreet Theatre immediately transports the audience\none hundred years back\nin time. Shelves crammed\nwith tools and ancient\nmilitary accessories, flags,\nphotographs, a big trunk,\na comfortable-looking\narmchair, an upright\npiano and the ever-present\nbottles of brandy give life\nto the stage. The feeling of\nintimacy created by this\nsetting is enhanced by the\nsmall number of seats and\nthe frequent incursions of\nthe actor to the stalls.\nThe piece itself is very\nintimate: a two-man show\nin first person, where\nboth actors play the same\ncharacter at different ages,\nand constantly dialogue\nwith the audience. Right\nfrom the start, Charles\nAitken as Billy Bishop\nbrilliantly conquers\neveryone\u2019s empathy with\nhis joyful portrait of youth\nand energy. And Oliver\nBeamish as the older Billy\nBishop provides a mature,\nretrospective analysis of\nthesamestories,whilealso\nplaying the piano accompaniment for the songs.\nThe pair work seamlessly\ntogether, complementing\neach other\u2019s narratives.\nOften they play additional\nroles, giving the action\nmomentum and surprising the audience. I just\nwished they were better\nsingers, but we can\u2019t have\neverything. What they\nlacked in pitch, though,\nwas largely compensated\nfor by performing skills.\nSubtle comic references and witty remarks are\na constant throughout the\nwhole piece. Lighthearted\nat first, the humour gets\nincreasingly dark, along\nwith the intensity of the\ndrama. In a remarkable\nscene, a cabaret performer sings joyfully about\nseveral pilots: \u201cNope, he\ndidn\u2019t survive...\u201d\nFor a generation who\nhas never experienced\nwar, our approach to it\nis often unrealistic and\nnaive. For us, like for\nBilly, sometimes, \u201cIt\ndoesn\u2019t seem like war at\nall\u201d. As such, the show\neffectively explores the\nenthusiasm of the young\nsoldier, who volunteers\nto fight and leaves his\nnative Canada in search of\nadventure. He later transfers to the aviation branch\nof the army, a highly\nsought-after position,\nto escape the mud and\nboredom of the trenches.\nHis confrontation with the\nrude cruelty of death and\nsurvival is violent. We\naccompany him through\nthe dark acceptance of\nthe reality of war and\nhis transformation into a\nfearless hero, the high-est-scoring pilot during\nWorld War I.\nThere are truly\nenchanting moments\nthroughout the piece. Just\nto name a few: letters\nto a longtime fianc\u00e9e; a\npriceless conversation\nin the War Office; the\ndelight of a pilot learning\nto fly; an action-packed\nscene of aerial stunting\nand shooting (yes, in\ntheatre!); the emotional\nfragility of a human being\nmourning his friends who\n\u201cain\u2019t supposed to die\u201d; an\nupper class lady\u2019s disgusted remarks on colonials\u2019\nmanners; and more.\nBilly Bishop Goes to\nWar is a powerful tale\nof humanity.

It is no surprise\nthen that the prize is closely watched by the rest of\nthe literary world, with\nthe winner announced on\n14th January 2019.\nThis year\u2019s shortlist is\n\u2018intensely political\u2019, says\nClare Pollard, one of the\nthree judges of this year\u2019s\nprize. Highlighting the\nimportance of words and\npoetry in today\u2019s political\ndiscourse, Pollard said\nthat an engagement with\nwords is all the more\ncrucial in today\u2019s culture\nof fake news. Pollard,\nalong with fellow poets\nand judges Sin\u00e9ad Morrissey (who chairs the\njudges) and Daljit Nagra,\nread a record 176 collections of poetry before\nsettling on the final ten.\nPrevious winners of the\nprize have included big\nnames like Ted Hughes,\nAlice Oswald and Carol\nAnn Duffy. This year,\nthe shortlist includes\nestablished poets like\nSean O\u2019Brien, a previous\nwinner of the prize, as well\nas five debut collections,\nmaking up an exciting\nmix of contemporary\nvoices. Here are the ten\nshortlisted collections:\nInsistence by Ailbhe Darcy\nThis is the second\ncollection from the Irish\npoet, and focuses on\nthemes of family, love and\nhome. A new child should\nmean new hope, but what\nif that is no longer true?\nWhat happens when the\nprivate word is threatened\nby a public one? Darcy\u2019s\ncollection is set in the\nAmerican Rust Belt, in\na time of climate change\nand disenchantment.\nInsistence examines the\nparent\u2019s responsibility to\nher child, the poet\u2019s responsibility to the reader\nand the individual\u2019s\nresponsibility in the face\nof a global crisis. This\ncollection is a response to\ntroubled times.\nAmerican Sonnets for My\nPast and Future Assassins\nby Terrance Hayes\nThis collection, Hayes\u2019\nsixth, was written during\nthe first 200 days of\nDonald Trump\u2019s presidency - one poem every\nday. It is a sequence of\nsonnets that tackles the\nfast-moving news cycle\nof American politics, an\nimmediate response to the\nequally immediate and\nchangeable media politics\nof Trump\u2019s America.\nTracing the fault lines of\nrace, gender and political\noppression, this collection\nof seventy poems touch on\neverything thrown around\nin American media and\npolitics, leaving no stone\nunturned. Just as the traditional sonnet attempts\nto express an inexpressible love, Hayes\u2019 poems\nattempt to make sense of\none\u2019s ties to a nation, in\ndisarmingly intimate but\nmasterful language.\nUs by Zaffar Kunial\nKunial was born in\nBirmingham to an English\nmother and a Kashmiri\nfather, and now lives\nin Hebden Bridge. The\ndifferences between his\nparents and his own upbringing make up part of\nthe \u2018us\u2019 that he examines\nin his debut collection.\nWhat does it mean to be\na human being seeking\nbelonging on this earth?\nKunial draws on different\nlands and peoples, from\nKashmir, where his father\nwas born, to the Midlands,\nwhere his mother grew up,\nand even to the Orkneys\nof her ancestors. He is the\nacknowledged poster boy\nof the Faber New Poets\nscheme, and this first collection heralds the arrival\nof a striking new voice.\nFeel Free by Nick Laird\nLaird\u2019sfourthcollection\nshares a title with his wife,\nZadie Smith\u2019s new essay\ncollection. While Smith\nexamines freedom in her\nobservations on reality,\nLaird does it through his\nmasterful use of poetic\nform, expressing feeling\nby freeing up words.\nEleanor Stern writes in\nThe London Magazine:\n\u2018few contemporary poets\ncan make old poetic\nforms feel natural and\nlyrical the way Laird can\u2019.\nAnd indeed, his poems\nrange from free verse to\nvillanelles, tackling issues\nfrom Grenfell to the\nrefugee crisis.\nThe Distal Point\nby Fiona Moore\nMoore\u2019s debut collection opens with a series\nof elegies for her late\npartner, who passed away\neleven years ago. Moore,\nwho used to work in\nthe Foreign Office, said\nshe left to write poetry\nbecause she realised that\nwas what she would regret\nnot doing when she was\n60. Her shortlist seems\nto be validation of this\ndecision. The poems here\nconfront personal loss and\nchange, to more far-reach-ing themes of European\nhistory and the politics of\npower.\nEuropa by Sean O\u2019Brien\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s earlier\ncollection The Drowned\nBook won both the TS\nEliot and Forward Prizes\nin 2015. Europa is his\nninth collection, and a\ntimely one. The poems in\nthis collection examine\nour present crises in the\ncontext of an imaginary\npast, suggesting that our\nfutures will be determined\nby what we make of\nour European identity,\nand what we choose to\nremember and forget of\nthe continent\u2019s shared\nhistory.\nShrines of Upper Austria\nby Phoebe Power\nPower was a winner\nof the Foyle Young Poets\nin 2009, and Shrines of\nUpper Austria, her debut\ncollection, won the 2018\nForward Prize for Best\nFirst Collection. It is a\ncollage of stories and\nhistories, written from a\nvariety of perspectives,\nranging from that of an\nAustrian woman who\nmarried a British soldier,\nto the voices of schoolchildren and immigrants,\ncutting across lands and\nlanguages.\nSoho by Richard Scott\nScott\u2019s first collection\ntakes an intimate, nuanced\nand uncensored look at\ngay identity and culture.\nIn contrast to the cor-porate, family-friendly,\nshopping-mall depictions\nof gay freedom, Soho\nconfronts the multiple\nfacets of gay identity\n- including the shame,\nintimacy, desire and\nviolence inherent to the\ngay experience.\nWade in the Water\nby Tracy K Smith\nSmith is not a new\nname in poetry - this is her\nfourth collection, and Life\non Mars won the Pulitzer\nPrize. In 2017, she was\nnamed Poet Laureate of\nthe US. This collection\ntakes its title from a\nspiritual, a type of song\nsung on the underground\nrailroad that carried slaves\nto safety in the 19th\ncentury, and its poems are\na patchwork of the voices\nand stories of slaves and\ntheir owners.\nThree Poems\nby Hannah Sullivan\nYet another debut\ncollection, Three Poems\nis an intimate collection,\ntouching on sex, giving\nbirth, death, but also\nbeauty and nature. Her\nwords tread lightly, and\nshed new light onto old\nsubjects.\nTerrance Hayes, one of the shortlisted poets of the TS Eliot Prize 2018 // Hannah Ensor\n\n"

The mood of each\nera is captured perfectly\nthrough notorious cultural\nreferences (like Nokia\nbricks and Donald Trump)\nand musical parodies.\nFor me, the standout\nperformance was that of\nthe MC, Marc Graham,\nwho moved us from\none section to the next\nsmoothly despite the large\ntime jumps. He knew\nexactly how to interact\nwith the audience and kept\nthe momentum of the play\ngoing without overpowering the stage. This was\naided by the well-chosen\nvenue, with the stage in\nthe centre and seating on\nall four sides of the room;\nthe audience could really\nfeel almost a part of the\nperformance.\nThe plot itself was\nnothing exceptional. The\nfamiliar tale of two kids\ncoming to terms with\nthe fallacy they\u2019ve been\nconvinced of by their\nparents their whole lives\u2013\nthat if they work hard they\ncan be successful \u2013 and a\nharsh reality in which this\npromise fails to materi-alise. Despite following\nsioned, and most of all,\nunhappy.\nIn reality, the simplicity\nof the storyline works in\ntheir favour; without the\nburden of keeping track of\na complicated narrative,\nthe audience can truly\nappreciate Paul Graham\u2019s\nfantastic direction and the\npoignant performances of\nthe actors.\nWhether this was an\nintentional choice by\nBarnes or not, you leave\nthe theatre in a state of\nself-reflection, and the\nthought that maybe, just\nmaybe, the stories of\nChris and Leah are not\njust of Chris and Leah, but\nof all of us.\nYounger viewers can\nrelate to wanting the ease\nand simplicity that our\nparents had; older viewers\ncan relate to wishing for\nthe opportunities and\ntechnology that their\nchildren have now.\nAll We Ever Wanted\nWas Everything intertwines the lost hopes and\ndreams of two generations\nand makes us wonder\nwhether even though the\nenvironment around is\nconstantly changing, does\nhuman nature ever really\nchange? No matter who\nor how old, the characters\nalways seemed to be after\nsomething they didn\u2019t\nhave or wallowing around\nand just waiting for good\nto magically come to\nthem.\nFor me, the take home\nmessage was that the\nenvironment we live in is\nalways going to leave us\nwanting more, whether\nthat\u2019s because of Brexit\nor the housing crisis.\nThe play functioned as a\nstatement that we should\nall collectively accept this\nand move on, and if we do\nthis then we can begin to\nseek a better future. We\naren\u2019t going to simply\n\u2018find\u2019 a place in the world\nwhere we belong, we must\nmake one for ourselves\nand \u201clive our lives\u201d, as\nGraham screams in his\nfinal impassioned mono-logue.\nA tantalising blend of storytelling and live music, Hull-based theatre company Middle Child catapults us from\ndecade to decade through the bittersweet stories of Leah and Chris.\nDrunk and disillusioned... remind you of anyone? // Bronwen Sharp\nARTS\nShivani Gangadia\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Check your facts with our guide to 12 types of most commonly found coffee\ndrinks, debunk the myths, and maybe even learn how to impress that cute barista!\nFOOD\nJulia Dabrowska\nFood Editor\n\u201cWhy is\nchoosing\na coffee so\nhard when all\nyou want is a\ncaffeine kick?\u201d\nI\nmagine this: you,\ncraving caffeine as\nany typical student,\nwalk into a coffee\nshop (or, depending on\nthe time of year, stumble\ninto the Library Caf\u00e9).\nScanning the menu,\nyou see many options \u2013\ncappuccinos, espressos,\nmochas, lattes\u2026 why is\nchoosing a coffee so hard\nwhen you don\u2019t speak\nItalian and all you want\nis that caffeine kick?\nCoffee novice or expert,\nbe it by an airport vending\nmachine or in a quirky\nbrewery, most of us have\nprobably been in that situation at some point, and it\nisn\u2019t pleasant. Therefore,\nwe bring to you a comprehensive guide to the most\ncommon coffee drink\ntypes you may encounter\nto avoid awkwardness or\njust to spice up your daily\ncoffee!\nNote: we are aware that\nthe descriptions of the\ncoffee types below may\nnot necessarily fit with the\noptions available at typical\ncoffee chains, since they\nusually add their own\nspin on things (or confuse\nthe different coffee types\nwith each other\u2026 I mean,\nreally, are we surprised at\nStarbucks?)\nESPRESSO\nThe most classic type\nof coffee. A foundation to\nall other types of coffee,\nthis is just a single shot of\ncoffee in a small espresso\ncup, perfect for an instant\nenergy boost (also works\npretty well if you don\u2019t\nlike the flavour of coffee\n\u2013 we all know shots are\neasiest to drink...). Some\nsay it helps with digestion,\nso you may find these\nbeing served after a meal.\nIt\u2019s also the cheapest on\nour list (usually).\n* Espresso Doppio\nA variation of the\nespresso, all this means\nis a double coffee shot\n(instead of a single as in\na classic espresso). Ideal\nfor recuperating after\nall-nighters.\nMACCHIATO\nSimilar to an espresso,\na macchiato is perfect\nfor those who just can\u2019t\nswallow a shot of full\nblack coffee (or just aren\u2019t\nnarcissists \u2013 some studies\nshow that those who drink\npure black coffee belong\nto this group). To balance\nout the harshness, a\nspoonful of steamed milk\nand foam is put on a single\nespresso shot. However,\ndo not confuse this with\nsome of the more milk-based drinks on our list \u2013\na macchiato is still served\nin a small espresso cup or\nglass, and the amount of\nmilk is negligible.\n* Long Macchiato\nA variation of the\nclassic or \u2018short\u2019 mac-chiato, all this means is a\ndouble coffee shot. Basically, a macchiato version\nof an espresso doppio, but\nwhy use 3 words when\nyou can use 2?\nCORTADO\nYet another variant of\nthe espresso for those who\ncan\u2019t handle its intensity.\nA cortado is essentially\nthe term for a typical\ncoffee with milk \u2013 an\nespresso shot is combined\nwith a splash of warm\nmilk (roughly the same\nquantity as the coffee, or\na dash more) to reduce\nthe bitterness and acidity\nof the pure alternative.\nTraditionally in Spain\n(from where it originates),\na double shot of espresso\nis used and the cortado is\nserved in a glass with a\nmetal ring base and wire\nhandle \u2013 fancy!\nRISTRETTO\nNot satisfied with the\nbitterness of your traditional espresso? Look\nno further. A ristretto\nis a more concentrated\nversion of the espresso,\nas it contains the same\namount of coffee but only\nhalf the amount of water.\nTruly a gold medal in the\nworld of the narcissist,\nand an equivalent to 99%\ndark chocolate \u2013 purity at\nits finest. Again, find this\nserved in a small espresso\ncup, or occasionally, an\neven smaller one.\nAMERICANO\nIn case an espresso or\na ristretto does not satisfy\nyour craving for a bitter\ntaste, an Americano is the\nsolution for you. These\ncontain a single shot of\nespresso, yet filled to a\nfull-size cup with hot\nwater. With a slightly\nless bitter taste due to the\ndilution by water, yet significantly more volume,\nanAmericano will last you\nmuch longer so that you\ncan relish the bitter taste\nof coffee in peace. Fun\nfact: the name originates\nfrom American soldiers\nduring WWII, who would\nmake this coffee to make\ntheir coffee last longer.\nCOLD BREW\nThe \u2018hipster\u2019 (does\nanyone even use that\nword anymore?) coffee\nof 2018. Although it has\nbeen around for much\nlonger, the cold brew has\ngained extreme popularity\nin recent summers as the\ntemperatures continued\nto rise and the sweet-cof-fee-haters took a stand\nagainst coffee chains\nonly serving iced lattes.\nSimilar to an Americano,\nyet with a higher coffee:\nLatte and Cappuccino at Warsaw\u2019s best coffee shop //\nJulia Dabrowska\nAl Rocker\u2019s Famous Cold Brew Coffee...// Shutterstock ...\nISSUE 1705\nFELIX\nFOOD food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nStill confused? Here\u2019s a visual summary // Margot Blue from Pinterest.com\n19\nwater ratio, tasting\nslightly sweeter, and\nbrewed on cold water.\nThe taste, however, is\nquite different \u2013 during\nthe brewing process,\nthe flavour compounds\nextracted are actually not\nthe same as those during a\ntypical hot brew.\nCAFF\u00c9 LATTE\nNow, where are all my\nbasic white bitches at? To\nbe completely honest, we\ndon\u2019t know why this drink\nhas such a bad reputation.\nConsisting of an espresso\nshot with a larger amount\nof milk than coffee (typ-ically 1:3 or 1:4) and a\ntiny bit of foam at the top\nin a glass, this is perfect\nfor when you want coffee\nwith a little sweetness and\nlots of volume to sip over\nan extended period of time\n(like that reeeally boring\nMonday morning lecture).\nOften features some pho-to-worthy designs made\nby swirling around the\nfoam layer with the coffee\nbeneath, also known as\n\u2018latte art\u2019.\nCAPPUCCINO\nComparable to a latte,\njust with less milk, and a\nthick layer of milk foam\non the top. A sensible\nmiddle ground between\ndrinking your coffee\nblack and boring and\noverly milky, this type of\ncoffee is arguably the best\nto drink at any time of\nday and in any situation,\nbecause, of course, you\ndon\u2019t want to commit a\ncoffee faux-pas and order\na latte after your afternoon\nmeal, do you? (Italians\nwould argue that any kind\nof milk-containing coffee\nis forbidden after break-fast, but let\u2019s have a more\nglobal viewpoint). An\nadded bonus is that many\noutlets add some sprinkled chocolate powder on\ntop for a yummy finish.\nFLAT WHITE\nA relatively new\naddition to the popularised\ncoffee market, a flat white\nis almost identical to a\ncappuccino but without\nthe foam or sprinkled\nchocolate (boring!). For\nthose of you watching\nyour figure (or pretending\nto as you buy a chocolate\nchip cookie alongside\nyour coffee), this slightly\ndecreases the caloric\ncontent of a cappuccino.\nIt also has a stronger taste\nof coffee and is the least\nsweet of all milk-based\ncoffee drinks. A good\nall-rounder, originating in\nthe lands down under, and\nour personal favourite.\nMOCHA\nWant caffeine, but\nreally craving chocolate\nand can\u2019t decide what hot\ndrink to order? The mocha\nis the answer, as it is a\nhybrid of a cappuccino\nand hot chocolate, with\nthe espresso shot and\nchocolate being mixed\nprior, and then topped off\nwith steamed milk and\nmilk foam. A delicious\ncombination of flavours\nand particularly good to\nwarm your stomach (and\nsoul) on bleak winter\ndays.\nFRAPPUCCINO\nYes, this drink is the\nepitome of most 15-year-old girls\u2019 lives. Yes,\nit\u2019s not even real coffee\n(or contains marginal\namounts). Is it still a\nmouth-watering dose of\nsugar we like to indulge in\nfrom time to time?Yes, for\na third time. Trademarked\nby Starbucks (with other\ncoffee chains having\nalternatives named Frostinos or Frappe Cr\u00e8mes),\nthis consists of a coffee\nor cr\u00e8me base, blended\nwith ice and a variety\nof syrups, sugar and/or\nother sweet ingredients\nand topped with whipped\ncream and a decoration of\nsome sort. From classics\nlike a caramel frappuc-cino, to limited edition\nfavourites like a pumpkin\nspice frappuccino, this\ncategory encompasses all\nsugar-full blended coffee\ndrinks (and to be honest,\nthey don\u2019t even all contain\ncoffee). Diabetes in a cup\n- guaranteed.\nIRISH COFFEE\nFor the finale, we\u2019re\ngetting real: this delectable coffee drink combines\ncoffee, alcohol and sugar\nall in one. Less commonly\nfound in coffee shops and\nmore reserved for bars or\nrestaurants, behind this\nname you can discover\nan ensemble of coffee,\nwhiskey, cream and a\nsmall (although it\u2019s a case\nof preference) amount of\nsugar. Don\u2019t be fooled -although this seems like\njust an innocent coffee, it\ncan really get you warm\nquite quickly (both literally and figuratively, if\nyou know what I mean),\nso enjoy it over time. And\nmake another one as soon\nas you\u2019re done, of course.\n\n"

It\nwas an entire week that\nhad been designed to look\nat the different aspects of\nesports, as well as focus\non the unique advantages\nof having a permanent\nspace for our students to\ntrain, stream online, watch\nthe pros, and more.\nThis project was\ndeveloped to accelerate\nthe investment from\nour University into the\nUniversity esports scene,\nby demonstrating it over\nthe course of the week\n(28th Oct - 3rd Nov).\nThe society currently\nhas multiple competitive\nteams, looking to continue\ntheir successes from last\nyear, such as when our\nOverwatch team became\nrunners-up in a University\neSports tournament that\nhosted more than 90 teams\nfrom across the UK.\nImperial eSports would\nlike to thank HyperX,\nGfinity and Shadow, our\nhardware sponsors, for\nmaking this possible.\nSports psychology\nin Esports- 30th Oct,\nTuesday\nWe worked with Lena\nKessler, a sport psychology consultant, to design\nand run a workshop\ntackling the mental attributes that are required\nin both sports and esports\nathletes. The 90-minute\nworkshop focused on\nintroducing sports psychology to our students,\nwhich included the relevance of the techniques\nused by athletes, and the\nimportance of strong leadership skills in the captain.\nImperial eSports is currently working with Sport\nImperial to potentially\nturn these workshops into\na regular training session\nfor our first teams.\n\u201cI found the sport\npsychology session very\ninteresting. We were encouraged to discuss some\nquestions about e-sports\nfrom the point of view\nof a sports psychologist.\nWe discussed things like\nperformance, teamwork,\nand communication in\ngroups and then discussed\nour ideas with the speaker.\nAt the end of the session,\nwe had been given some\ntools to help practice\nand improve on our team\ncommunication along\nwith ideas of what affects\nour personal performance.\nOverall the session was\nengaging and educational.\u201d - Enda\nDota 2 1st team\npractice- 31st Oct,\nWednesday\nA room was provided\nto our first team for their\nregular practice session.\nRather than playing games\nin their own rooms and\ncommunicating through\nDiscord, a popular VoIP\napplication, the players\nwere able to interact with\neach other directly as well\nas review their game more\nefficiently through the\nuse of the projector in the\nroom.\n\u201cMost members\nenjoyed gaming using\nbetter equipment than\nthey have at home.

The Hold\nApp is here to help you out\nHold is an app developed to help students as they struggle balancing phone use while studying, rewarding\ntime spent offline with free rewards and helping build a healthier relationship with technology\nTECH\nAline Buat\nTech Writer\n\u201cYou can even\ncompete with\nyour friends\nand other\nstudents in\nImperial\u201d\nI\nt has been one and\na half months since\nthe end of summer\nbreak, and I guess\nmany of our students\nalready feel submerged\nby the workload and are\nwilling to be more effi-cient. However, simple\nobservations from the\nclassroom show us that\nusing our phones during\nclass or revision affects\nour focus. Present in our\npockets, on the table or\nat the back of our minds,\nour phones keep us from\nimportant tasks.\nRetaining information\nunder such conditions\nis much harder. It is\nestimated that we learn\n62% better when we are\naway from our phones.A\nstudy from the London\nSchool of Economics\nshowed that students\u2019\ntest scores increased\nby 6.41% after banning\nphone usage. The media\nis constantly talking\nabout \u201cphone addiction\u201d.\nAlthough we know that\nusing mobile technology\nwhile working is a bad\nidea, many of us still do\nit anyway, so finding a\nsolution is essential.\nIf staying away from\nyour dear mobile phone\nseems hard, don\u2019t worry:\nthere is now an app rewarding you for exactly\nthat. With Hold, offline\ntime can be fun and\nrewarding.\nAfter being contacted\nby their team for a potential article, we were able\nto get some useful information and interesting\nstatistics about the app\nas well as some personal\ntesting experience.\nHold was launched\nin Norway in February\n2016, where its founders\nhad noticed the importance of tackling such an\nissue in classrooms. Their\nsuccess was immediate:\nwithin the first 3 months,\nmore than 50,000 people\nhave downloaded the app.\nAn adoption rate of more\nthan 40% in Norway led\nto international recogni-tion, and the app has now\nexpanded to Sweden and\nthe UK. Consequently,\nthe team now has its\nheadquarters in London\nnot far from campus\nand started recruiting\nnew members in the UK\nto better fit the needs\nof a newfound student\npopulation. When the\napp launched in March\n2018 in the UK, Imperial\nCollege was one of the\nfirst universities where it\nlaunched, and over 1,000\nImperial students already\nuse the app.\nThe concept is simple:\nwhen you activate the\n\u201cHold mode\u201d in the app,\na counter will run and the\napp will do everything\nto help you not look at\nyour phone. For every\n20 min spent away from\nthe phone, you earn\n10pts that can be spent\non the Hold marketspace\n(yes, that\u2019s where to\nfind the reward, a real,\nphysical, free reward).\nThis includes vouchers,\ndiscounts on products or\nservices, such as drinks,\nsnacks, cinema reduc-tion, items of clothing,\netc. The brand has partnership with big compa-nies, such as Coca-Cola,\nVue, Danske Bank, and\n20th Century Fox. To\nclaim the rewards, you\nwill need your college\nemail address.\nOn top of that, you\ncan even compete with\nyour friends and other\nstudents in Imperial by\nseeing who\u2019s got the\nlongest streak and points,\nwith the \u201cHighscore\u201d\nfunctionality. Finally, no\ncheating is possible: you\ncannot earn Hold points\nduring certain times of\nthe night (00:00-06:00).\nBeing away from\nyour phone is working\ntowards a better\nlifestyle, so it seems\nlogical that the app\nsets one more thing to\nprotect you from \u2013 the\noverworking extreme.\nTherefore, no need to\nspend all-nighters in the\nlibrary either.\nEasilyfoundonGoogle\nPlay and the App store, it\nis free of charge. It has\na blue and white logo as\nwell, not to be confused\nwith the Imperial app.\nUpon opening the app, it\nimmediately welcomes\nthe user and gives the\ncheering incentive to\npush \u201cthe big button\u201d\n(could be bigger) and put\nthe phone on \u201chold\u201d. The\nrest of the app being very\nintuitive (only 3 menus\nsubdivided in classes).\nWhile activated, using\nyour phone is (almost\nliterally) forbidden: if\nyou try to swipe down to\nlook at your notifications,\nthere will be a bold \u201cYou\nare on Hold. Hang in\nhere!\u201d reminding you\nto come back. Trying to\nleave the app for another\none will reward you with\nan immediate pop-up\ncalling you back, with\nthe nice message: \u201cYou\nused your phone. Tap\nto continue holding. Be\nquick!\u201d. Refusing to\nobey will break your hold\ntime.\nFrom my own experience on the app, I will\nshare a few points that can\nmake the app work for\nyou, and how it induces a\nchange in our relation to\ntechnology. First, the app\nis using everything at its\ndisposal to make you use\nit as Hold contains all the\nelements of an addictive\ngame: time, points that\ncan be lost if you stop\nin the middle, reaching a\nhigher level, rewards and\ncheerful texts. Secondly,\nit helps you work better\nby interrupting you if\nyou attempt to use your\nphone. But further than\nthe practical aspect,\nit creates a healthier\nrelationship with tech-nology. The purpose of\nthe pop-ups, notifications\nand messages is to raise\nself-awareness of your\npersonal phone usage\nwhile studying. Instead\nof simply unlocking it,\nrealizing how often you\nusually look at your\nphone is one of the most\nimportant points.\nIn my opinion, we\nshouldn\u2019t be dependent\non the app to discourage\nphone usage. However,\nit can be our first step\nto learn how to \u201ctame\ntechnology\u201d and build a\nhealthy relationship with\ntechnology. Ultimately,\nall the advantages of the\ninterconnected world\nwould blend nicely\ntogether with a self-aware, responsible use of\ntechnology.\nHold // Google Play\nISSUE 1705\nFELIX\nTECH tecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cWith Hold,\noffline time\ncan become\nfun and\nrewarding.\u201d\n\n"

Prospective\nbuyer, James, is keen to\nbuy the house and ready\nto pay in cash. Yet he\u2019s\nbizarrely fascinated with\nClair, insisting on dealing\nexclusively with her and\neager to see the house,\nand Clair, as many times\nas possible.\nThere are so many\nfacets to the subtle\npsychological horror of\nDealing With Clair that\nit\u2019s difficult to unpack.\nJames\u2019s obsession with\nClair is clearly sinister,\nbut at the same time there\nis a vicious undertone to\nMike and Liz\u2019s casual\nruthlessness. Crimp\ncreates a sense of unease\nthat builds up as the play\nprogresses. It\u2019s pervasive,\nyet you can never put your\nfinger on exactly the root\nof your discomfort. Genuinely unsettling writing is\nhard to achieve and it\u2019s a\ntestament to Crimp\u2019s skill\nthat he does it so easily.\nFly Davis\u2019s set is\nperfect for this play. The\naction takes place in a\nrectangular box of transparent gauze, with the\naudience on all 4 sides in\na relatively small space. It\ngives you the impression\nthat you are looking into\nthe lives of the characters:\nsomething that comes to\nhave an eerie significance\nlater on in the play. The\ncast certainly don\u2019t let\ndown the staging. Lizzy\nWatts starts off a little\nstilted in the opening\nscene but really grows\ninto her character as the\nplay progresses, bringing\nan innocent charm to\ntitular character Clair.\nShe captures the matter-of-fact pleasantness that\ncomes with her work,\nwhilst hinting at more\ncomplex emotions below\nthe surface. Michael\nGould is excellent as\nJames, bringing superficial charm, with a clear\nundertone of something\nsinister.\nThere are flaws to be\nsure. Anna, Mike and\nLiz\u2019s teenaged au pair,\nsometimes seems out of\nplace as a character. She\nclearly exists to emphasize the unscrupulousness\nof the couple, exploiting\nthis 17 year-old from Italy\nas a babysitter who is\ngiven \u2018spending money\u2019\nin lieu of a salary. But\nreally, Anna as a character\nadds little to the play and\nyou can\u2019t help but wonder\nif there weren\u2019t other\nways to emphasize Mike\nand Liz\u2019s underhanded-ness, or even whether this\nemphasis is necessary.\nDespite being written\nmore than 30 years ago,\nDealing with Clair feels\nweirdly topical and often\nall too real: definitely a\nmust-watch for any fan of\npsychological horror.\nYou couldn\u2019t make it up if you tried\nL\nands isn\u2019t really\nabout anything.\nOn the face of\nit, it consists of\nwatching a tragicomedic\nfarce about a woman who\ncan\u2019t stop bouncing on a\ntrampoline and her friend\nwho tries in vain to get her\noff. But what could have\nbeen a somewhat insensitive piece about addiction\nbecomes both darker and\nfunnier thanks to the tiresomely mundane setting.\nSophie is doing a puzzle,\ndescribing the pieces into\na microphone, possibly\nfor a blog or podcast. Leah\nBrotherhead is jumping\non a mini-trampoline\n(trampette for the purists).\nLeah tells a story about\nGordon Ramsay, and eats\na satsuma. Sophie makes\na connection and does a\ndance. Leah throws the\nfruit peel on the floor and\nSophie ends up picking it\nup after asking her several\ntimes to do it herself.\nAnd so emerges the\ntension, from the cracks\nand the slightly sharper\nthan necessary words. It\nsoon becomes apparent\nthat Leah can\u2019t get off\nthe trampoline, won\u2019t\nget off the trampoline.\nWhy? Who knows, but,\nlike that, the two women\nwho had previously been\nso absorbed in their own\nlives as to not notice the\nother\u2019s bizarre habits\ncome to loggerheads.\nLeah is fantastic, a volatile\nmix of self-pity and anger\n\u2013 not an easy thing to pull\noff when bouncing up and\ndown \u2013 who faces being\nslapped, shouted at and\nabused, all in the name of\nhelping her. It would take\nthe sensitivity of a stone\nnot to hear the subtext\nroar of \u201cMETAPHOR\u201d\nbut clich\u00e9 is (narrowly)\navoided, due, in large part,\nto the fact that this is a\ntrampoline we are talking\nabout.\nThe normally slick\nscript, handily provided\non the night, allows the\nactors space to improvise\nand decide themselves\nhow things should sound.\nThis often came in the\nform of a little note after\na line saying \u201cActors may\nchoose how many times\nthis is repeated\u201d. This was\nsometimes less effective\nas they really took this\nadvice to heart, spewing\nout enormous refrains\nof \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d, \u201cGo\u201d and\n\u201cLeave me alone\u201d.\nWhen Leah does finally\nstep down off the tram-poline, for the first time.\nthe air rings with the lack\nof creaking bed springs,\nwhich had become so\npresent I noticed more\nthat they were gone. There\nis another metaphor in\nthat somewhere. Sophie\u2019s\nattempts to lure Leah\naway from her compulsive\nhobby only serve to make\nSophie look as unhinged\nas Leah, only with a\nhobby more acceptable to\nthe public mind. Further\nintellectual deliberations\nare interrupted by a\nhilarious, though terrifyingly realistic fight, that\nresults in a puzzle being\nthrown on the floor. While\nridiculous, the play has so\neffectively enveloped me\nat this point, I keen with\nSophie as she literally\npicks up the pieces. As\nI said at the beginning,\nLands isn\u2019t really about\nanything, just two friends,\nwho like the rest of us\ncan\u2019t always take their\nblinkers off and see the\npeople around them until\nit really is too late.\nMichael Gould as creepy buyer James // The Other Richard\nARTS\nVaishnavi\nGnanananthan\nArts Editor\nWhere?

But beware, the gates have opened to allow\nthe flooding of capitalisation on your prized good, and it may not be yours for long.\nCOMMENT\nMartin Flerin\nComment Writer\nM\na r i j u a n a\nusers all\nover rejoiced\nearlier this\nmonth when Canada\nbecame the first big\nWestern democracy to\nlegalize free use of can-nabis. Canadians actually\nrejoiced so much that the\ncountry is now facing a\nweed shortage. It seems\nlike the world is finally\nready to move on from the\nquestion of whether marijuana should be legalized\nwith a resounding yes; the\nmatter of letting people of\nall passport colours post\npictures of their favourite\nkush on insta seems like a\nwait for all the puzzles to\nfall into place. But while\nno one will be mourning\nthe death of the reviled\nWar on Drugs\u2122, I believe\nthe sudden change in attitude towards marijuana\nshould be examined, and\nits integration into mass\nconsumerism followed\nclosely.\nNever again will the\nhowling harmonica of\nGraham Nash\u2019s \u2018Prison\nSong\u2019 ring true for\nman smoking weed\nin the modern era.\nGetting in trouble for\nmarijuana possession or\nconsumption will soon\nbe a thing of the past,\nthe date stamped on the\narrest paperwork of the\nlast oppressed stoner,\nhanging in the museums\nof future millennia, will\nsurely not extend far\ninto the 2020s. Good.\nIt was about time. The\npersecution of marijuana\nwas meaningless,\nmisguided, and mainly\na result of mass hysteria\nabout the hippie\ncounterculture.\nIt is also good news\nthat studies into the\nmedicinal uses of\nmarijuana will now be\ncarried out with fewer\nlegislative roadblocks\nto overcome. This might\nmean that the medicinal\npower hidden in the\ngreen plant, which had\nbeen used to soothe\npain thousands of\nyears before medicinal\nmarijuana cards were a\nthing, might finally be\nunlocked. Additionally,\nas tolerance by the\ngeneral public to\nmarijuana being used\nas medication increases,\nit will eventually result\nin any leftover stigma\nagainst its use to be\nforgotten.\nSo far, the possible\nimplications of cannabis\nbecoming legalised\neverywhere sound good.\nSo why would marijuana\nconsumers and members\nof the general public\nalike be sceptical about\nthe swift changes in\nboth the hive mind\nconsensus and legal\nstatus that marijuana\nhas undergone? Is\nit worrying that the\npublic image of the\ncannabis enthusiast is\nno longer in the mould\nof Jeffrey Lebowski,\nbut in the shape of Elon\nMusk joking that he\u2019ll\nfloat Tesla for $420\nand blazing up on Joe\nRogan\u2019s podcast?\nThe answer I\u2019m\noffering up comes in\nthe shape of an IKEA\nbox of parts \u2013 some\nfacts and some gnawing\nfears \u2013 which have no\ninstructions on how to\nbe put together. The\nreason why this situation\nis so unprecedented\nis that marijuana is\na complete stranger\nto the new strains of\ncarnivorous capitalism\nthat humans have\nthought up since it was\nbanished to a dungeon,\nalong with derivatives\nof coca and opium, by\nthe International Opium\nConvention in the early\n20th century. Having\nsurvived in the shadows,\nresuscitated in part by\nshady dealers, trusty\nhome-growing uncles,\nand the starving lungs\nof stoners everywhere,\nthere is no telling how it\nwill fare in the burning\nlight of corporate forces.\nIt is no wonder that\ntobacco companies were\nhoping to get in on the\nact. Tobacco shares are\ndropping, people in the\ndeveloped world are\nquitting smoking. On the\nother hand, millennials\nlove weed, having been\nborn into the world\nof the internet, where\nubiquitous and effortless\nanonymity allowed for\nfree discussion of taboo\nsubjects \u2013 including\ncannabis. The subreddit\nr/trees, dedicated to\nall things cannabis,\nis the 91st largest\nsubreddit by number\nof subscribers, 41st if\nthe default subreddits\nare not counted. The\nmarket to tap into is\nhuge. Forbes reported\nthat the generations that\nhave recently become\nover-age are causing\nbeer sales in the USA\nto plummet, due to the\ngrowing realisation\nthat the harm done by\nsmoking cannabis is\nworth it when compared\nto the dangers of\nalcohol. When taking\nthis into account, it\nmakes perfect sense that\nit is actually companies\non the alcoholic\nbeverage market\nthat are funnelling\nthe most money\ninto up-and-coming\ncannabis companies.\nConstellation Brands,\nthe maker of Corona\nand one of the biggest\nalcohol producers in the\nworld, has been steadily\nincreasing its stake\nin Canopy, the most\nvalued medical cannabis\ncompany in Canada.\nThe problems that\ncould arise from weed\nbecoming a mass\nconsumer product are\nmany.\nThere could be issues\nwith obtaining permits,\nleading to a situation\nwhere only companies\nwith lobbying power are\nable to grow it legally.\nA monopolisation of\nthe market, where large\nproducers stifle the little\nguys and end up offering\na limited selection of\nproducts, all streamlined\nto feed the masses can\nalso easily be envisaged.\nElon looking more baffled than our Comment Editor in a lecture// knowtchie.com\nThe worst scenario of all\nis one where the R&D\ndivisions of old tobacco\nfirms are let loose on\ncannabis, in order to\nprocess what used to be\nDIY, stoners showing off\ntheir rolling skills and\nsharing secret etiquette,\ninto an addictive\npackage, where the only\ngoal is to make the users\nsmoke more and more.\nThe overarching issue\nthat most of my friends\nin stoner circles have\nwith it is that the \u201csoul\nof the sport\u201d will be\nsucked out of it. To me,\nat least, it seems that\nthe fact that a CEO of\na multi-billion-dollar\ncorporation is so easily\nabletoenhancehispublic\nimage by namedropping\nmarijuana, is a symptom\nof the pendulum\nswinging too far.\nSmoking weed\nis supposed to be\nall about keeping it\ncool.

As\npart of their efforts to accurately capture the music\nthat is being listened to\nmost, major music chart\ntabulators like Billboard\nhave adjusted to this\ntrend. As of 2018, streaming constitutes the single\nlargest category for the\nweighting of songs on the\nBillboard Hot 100\u2014more\nthan both radio airplay and\ndigital sales. Spotify is the\nlargest paid subscription\nmusic streaming service\nwith over 71 million\nsubscribers and a 30 million subscriber lead over\nApple Music. The genres\nof music that dominate the\ncharts have also shifted. In\n2017, for the first time in\nhistory, hip-hop became\nthe most listened-to genre\nof music in the US, and\nits lead has only extended\nin the time since. This\nshift can be linked in\npart to the fact that the\nprimary platform of music\nconsumption is no longer\nradio, where censorship\nand a lowest-common-de-nominator mindset led\nto the prevalence of pop\nmusic. Now that most\nmusic consumers are actively choosing what they\nlisten to more so than in\ntimes past, (curating play-lists, playing artist radio)\ngenres that are censored\nby gatekeepers gain more\nconsumption.\nAnother factor that\nexplains the rise of\nhip-hop is the shift within\nhip-hop towards a more\npop-friendly soundscape,\nissued in part by crossover acts like Kanye\nWest and Drake about a\ndecade ago. It is hard to\ntrace common stylistic\nand sonic elements from\nhip-hop in the 1980s and\nhip-hop today, which\nleads to the assertion that,\nby and large, hip-hop is a\nformless genre. There are\nno real musical criteria,\ntempo, drum pattern, or\nanything inherent in the\nmusic that is required for\na song to be considered\nhip-hop by consumers.\nRather, the genre is\ncommonly characterised\nby characters: subject\nmatter, lingo, tropes, and\nparticipants. This sort of\nmischaracterisation and,\ndare I say, bastardisation\nof hip-hop has been oc\u201cThere is no\nreal musical\ncritera... for\na song to be\nconsidered\nhip-hop by\nconsumers \u201d\nmost from a culture that\nhe isn\u2019t fully committed\nto.\nIn 2017, Post Malone\ngot in trouble for a\ncomment that he made\nwhile drunk in an interview in Poland. While\ndiscussing his stance on\nrap, Post said, \u201cIf you\u2019re\nlooking for lyrics, if\nyou\u2019re looking to cry, if\nyou\u2019re looking to think\nAlways tired // @postmalone Instagram\nthe mammoth singles\n\u201cRockstar,\u201d \u201cPsycho,\u201d and\n\u201cBetter Now,\u201d Beerbongs\n& Bentleys is a bona fide\npop mega-album. Quite\nfrankly, it\u2019s surprising\nhow shamelessly this\nof the 18 songs on B&B\nlie within 15 seconds of\nhis 3:40 niche. B&B has\nbeen sitting uninterrupt-edly in the top 10 of the\nBillboard 200 for the past\nsix months, and his other\nMUSIC\nJordan Bunke\nMusic Writer\ncurring in the public arena\nfor a few years now, and it\nhas resulted in a quagmire\nthat has received ample\nattention from several\noutlets, from music blogs\nto LA Times think pieces:\nPost Malone.\nIf someone asked me\nwhat the most streamed\nalbum of 2018 was, and\nI didn\u2019t know better, I\nwould respond, \u201cScorpion\nby Drake\u201d without a\nmoment\u2019s hesitation. In\nterms of charting domi-nation, tour revenue, and\nhis uncanny ability to\noccupy the zeitgeist, it\nis hard to dispute that he\nis the biggest music act\nin the world. However,\nI would be wrong. The\nmost-streamed album of\n2018, at least on Spotify,\nis Post Malone\u2019s Beerbongs & Bentleys. Upon\ninvestigation, this isn\u2019t a\nhuge surprise. Between\nalbum is geared towards\ncommercial performance.\nPost Malone\u2019s biggest hits\nare \u201cCongratulations,\u201d \u201cI\nFall Apart,\u201d \u201cRockstar,\u201d\nand \u201cPsycho.\u201d All these\ntracks have a runtime that\nis within three seconds of\nbeing 3:40 long. Post or\nsomeone in his creative\ncamp seems to be aware\nof this homogeneity, as 13\nalbum Stoney broke the\nrecord held by Michael\nJackson\u2019s Thriller for the\nmost consecutive weeks\nspent in the top 10 of\nthe Top R&B/Hip-Hop\nAlbums chart (77). The\nproblem with Post Malone\nisn\u2019t that he is a shamelessly commercial artist.\nThe problem with Post\nMalone is that he benefits\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe\nPost Malone\nis conscioiusly\nexploiting\nhip-hop for\ncommercial\nsuccess, but his\nlabel certainly\nis.\u201d\nabout life, don\u2019t listen to\nhip-hop. [\u2026] Whenever\nI want to cry, whenever\nI want to sit down and\nhave a nice cry, I\u2019ll listen\nto some Bob Dylan. But\nwhenever I\u2019m trying to\nhave a good time and\nstay in a positive mood, I\nlisten to hip-hop because\nit\u2019s fun.\u201d This quote\nhighlights what\u2019s wrong\nwith Post Malone. I don\u2019t\nbelieve that Post Malone\nis consciously exploiting\nhip-hop for commercial\nsuccess, but his label\ncertainly is. \u201cRockstar\u201d\nand \u201cPsycho,\u201d B&B\u2019s\npromotional singles,\ntapped two high-profile\nhip-hop acts as features:\n21 Savage and Ty Dolla\n$ign, respectively.\nHowever, the full album\nwas deemed ineligible by\nthe Recording Academy\nfor nomination in the Best\nRap Album category, as\nMUSIC\nFRIDAY, 9TH\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nA new muse-cal direction\nThree years after the\nconclusion of Drones, the\nEnglish \u201crock\u201d band Muse\nreturns with their eighth\nstudio album, Simulation\nTheory. Unlike anything\nthey have released before,\nSimulation Theory is a po-lariser that will fragment\ntheir fanbase with its\nshockingly foreign\nsoundscapes of electronic\nrock and synth-pop.\nGuitarist and lead singer\nMatt Bellamy\u2019s unique\nis a simulation, inspired\nby Bellamy\u2019s concern\nof world domination by\ntechnological conspiracies over the majority of\nMuse\u2019s career.\n\u2018Thought Contagion\u2019\nand \u2018The Void\u2019 see a\nrelatively effective and\nnatural juxtaposition of\nelectronica and rock.\nHowever, in an attempt\nto make up for different\nstylistic absences in their\nprevious albums and\nbreak out of singing about\nfearing the corrupt power\nstructure, most tracks\nincluding \u2018Propaganda\u2019\nand \u2018Break it to Me\u2019, are\noverbearing, crowded\npieces that unfold like an\nautomatic pop-up tent in a\nportaloo. Lyrically, many\nsongs on the album like\n\u2018Blockades\u2019, are complex\nand introspective, but the\nmessages are drowned\nout by the overwhelming\nunload of electronica,\nwhich devalues them to\nthe static noise playing in\na cheap night club. The\nalbum is merely diluted by\nthe stripped back acoustic\nversions of the tracks,\nwhich I predict will be\nstreamed more frequently\nthan the laptop music\noriginals. What looks like\nan 80s Daddy Yankee/\nSean Paul collaboration\nbehind the Risky Business-borrowed cursive\nneon pink font, the cover\nart design is convoluted\nand very much reflective\nof the overproduced and\ncrammed tracks that the\nalbum contains.\nA drifting piece of tumbleweed in today\u2019s music\ncharts, Simulation Theory\nis too innovative and\nlikely to be remembered\nby Muse\u2019s diehard fans\nas a distasteful and messy\nmix of futuristic and 80s\ntechno pop sounds\u2026 if it\nwill be remembered at all.\nMaryana says the new muse album is as jarring as its album cover\nconsumers. He himself\nassociates hip-hop with\nthe gimmicks and caricatures that some now use\nto define it in place of\nconcrete sonic standard\nthat no longer exists. His\nfirst single had him in\nTexas. He moved to LA\nas a kid who loved Guitar\nHero with a dream of\nmaking it in music. He\nproduced his debut single\n\u201cWhite Iverson\u201d himself\nand designed the cover art.\nDespite the oft-shallow\ncontent of his lyrics and\nhis ad nauseum recycling\nof already tired tropes,\none cannot deny his\npenchant for hit-making\nand keen ear for melodies.\nHe is clearly talented and\nhas a lofty ceiling in the\nmusic industry. However,\nhe can\u2019t eat his cake and\nhave it too if he wants\nto go down as one of the\ngreats and not just a fad\nthat listeners shamefully\nremember for pushing to\nthe top of the charts. Ignorance is no excuse for the\nexploitation of the culture.\n\u201cPost Malone\nhimself has\ngotten caught\nin the trap\nthat has\ncaught many\nconsumers\u201d\nhooping gear sporting\ncornrows and a grill,\nproclaiming himself to be\nthe \u201cWhite Iverson\u201d. Over\nthe course of his career,\nhe has added face tattoo\nafter face tattoo to his\ngrowing collection. This\nis how Post Malone views\nhip-hop. Gimmicks from\na fringe of Lil Wayne-inspired late millennials\nwhose domain is confined\nto YouTube and Instagram. It is worth noting\nthat it is entirely possible\nto be a hip-hop head and\nhave never encountered\nPost Malone; in fact, it\nis quite common. Like\nEminem, to whom Post\nis compared for obvious\nreasons, Post Malone\u2019s\nfan demographic differs\ndrastically from most\nother mainstream hip-hop\nacts. However, unlike\nPost Malone, Eminem\nunabashedly embraced\nthe culture and staunchly\nidentifies as a hip-hop act\nand a rapper.\nPost Malone was born\nin Syracuse, New York\nand grew up in Dallas,\n\u201cHe has\nadded face\ntattoo after\nface tattoo to\nhis growing\ncollection. This\nis how Post\nMalone views\nHip-hop\u201d\nnot enough of its runtime\nproportion is hip-hop.\nPost Malone has rejected\nthe \u201crapper\u201d and \u201chiphop\u201d labels in the past,\npreferring to consider\nhimself a \u201cmusician\u201d or a\n\u201crockstar\u201d. As his quote to\nthe Polish outlet indicates,\nPost Malone himself has\ngotten caught in the trap\nthat has caught many Beerbongs and Bentleys // Republic Records\ntone is the only thing that\nwill allow one to place\nthis experimental album\nin the vicinity of Muse\u2019s\nprevious records.\nWith past albums all\nfollowing dark themes\nMUSIC\nMaryna Volshyna\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Muse Label: Warner\nBros.

This\nfollows Washington allowing eight countries to\ncontinue buying Iranian\ncrude, softening the blow\nof new international\nsanctions on the nation.\nIn addition to this the\nUS Energy Information\nAdministration\u2019s weekly\ninventory report last\nWednesday showed\nthat US domestic crude\nstockpiles have increased\nfor a seventh week to\n432m barrels, the most\nsince June. Consequently,\nmany investors see this\nas a sign that concerns\nover abundancy of oil\nreserves diminishing and\nthe buying pressure of\nthis commodity reducing.\nAs a result of this, commodity traders such as\nWarren Patterson of IGN,\nbelieve \u201cPrice weakness\nhas raised the prospect\nof OPEC reversing their\nrecent policy of producing\nas much as they can, to\none where they show\nmore restraint\u201d. As ex-pected, on Monday Saudi\nArabia opened the door to\ncutting crude production\n(despite Russia saying\nthat an excess of supply is\nshort term, putting these\ntwo big oil producers at\nodds), causing a jump in\noil by 2%. Khalid al Falih,\nthe kingdoms energy min-ister, said the state energy\ngiant SaudiAramco would\nsupply 500,000 fewer\nbarrels a day in December\ncompared with November\ndue to lower demand. It\nwas only earlier this year\nthat Saudi Arabia targeted\nan increase in production\nof 1 million barrels a day\nbecause of the pressure of\nthe Trump administration,\nwho called on the OPEC\nnations to fill the void after\nIranian sanctions depleted\nworld supply. However,\nas Trump granted waivers to big customers of\nIran such as India and\nChina, fears arose about\noversupply. Despite what\nanalysts at consultancy\nFGE forecasting a drop in\nIranian oil supply of 1.3\nmillion barrels per day in\nthe next six months, as\nBrian Hook, US special\nrepresentative for Iran,\nsaid on Monday that there\nwould be further sanctions\nas \u201cour goal remains getting countries to zero over\ntime\u201d. One key metric\nis the fact that hedge\nfunds have gone from\nbeing bullish on crude oil\nearlier in 2018 to sharply\nreducing their positions\nin the past few weeks,\nindicating that many are\nbetting that the cycle has\nturned, although some analysts believe that if more\nbarrels are cut from Iran\nthan currently expected,\nfunds will rush back into\nthe market adding fuel to\nany rally.\nWhat is also important\nto note as a direct consequence of falling crude\nprices is that it caused\na sell-off in high yield\nenergy bonds. The last\nsell-off in 2014 with a\n14% decline in oil prices,\nmore than 100 energy\ncompanies went bankrupt.\nIt is true though that the\nforces driving the oil\nprices lower are different\nin 2018 than 2014 and\nmore importantly the\nfundamental quality of\nhigh yield issuers has\nimproved, making the\nrecent drop in oil prices\nless troubling. The fact is\nthat energy is one of the\nmost attractive sectors for\nhigh income investors,\ndue to the fact that spreads\nhave yet to reflect the\nfundamental problems of\nthe industry. The spread\non energy bonds on\nNovember 8th was 432\nbasis points, compared\nto 335 basis points for\nthe rest of the high-yield\nmarket.\nT\nhe Economist\nhas called them\n\u201can addiction\nto corporate\ncocaine.\u201d Reuters has\ncalled them \u201cself-cannibalization.\u201d The Financial\nTimes has called them \u201can\noverwhelming conflict of\ninterest.\u201d In an article that\nwon the HBR McKinsey\nAward for the best article\nof the year, Harvard\nBusiness Review has\ncalled them \u201cstock price\nmanipulation.\u201d These influential journals make a\npowerful case that wholesale stock buybacks are a\nbad idea\u2014bad economi-cally, bad financially, bad\nsocially, bad legally and\nbad morally. Yet despite\nthese powerful denunci-ations, stock buybacks\nnot only continue but are\nhappening at a larger scale\nthan ever seen before.And\nthis raises the question\nof why, how, what, who,\nwhen and where?\nTo answer a few of\nthese questions, let\u2019s first\nsee what share buy backs\nare. Share buy backs are\nwhen a company that\nissued the shares repur-chases the shares back\nfrom its shareholders.\nDuring a buyback, the\ncompany pays shareholders the market value per\nshare. With a buyback,\nthe company can purchase\nstocks on the open market\nor from its shareholders\ndirectly. Share buybacks\nare a popular method for\nreturning cash to share-holders.\nWhy do companies\ndo them? This can be\nfor multiple reasons. For\nmammoth companies like\nApple which are sitting\non a huge pile of cash\nreserve ($250 billion),\ncarrying this amount\nof equity capital on the\nbalance sheet becomes\nmore of a burden than a\nblessing, as shareholders\ndemand returns on their\ninvestments in the form of\ndividends which is a cost\nof equity.The business is\nessentially paying for the\nprivilege to access funds\nit isn\u2019t using. Buying\nback some or all of the\noutstanding shares can\nbe a simple way to pay\noff investors and reduce\nthe overall cost of capital.\nThese huge buybacks not\nonly preserve the value of\nthe stocks but also boost\nthem as it drives an influx\nof investors.\nOn next week\u2019s article,\nwe will continue to\nexamine benefits of share\nbuybacks but also see\nwhy they are unpopular\nand even seen by some as\nstock price manipulation.\nDo share buy backs contribute to market manipulation // eFinancial Careers\nIs there an oversupply of crude oil in the market?// FT\n35\n\n"

I can definitely tell you it\u2019s better\nthan ever, having played\nthrough several psychotic\nrampages as a soda can\nwielding madman dressed\nin a fluorescent flamingo\noutfit in some form of\ntwisted reincarnation of\nPepsi man.\nStory:\nAfter the mishaps that\ntook place in the last game,\nand the veil being lifted\nfrom Agent 47\u2019s eyes concerning the shadow client,\nhe continues to endeavour\nto find out more about his\npast whilst being assigned\ncontracts by Providence\nto take down Providence\nmembers who pose a\nrisk to the society. All the\nwhile gathering information on his former friend\nand compatriot. Taking\ndown the members one\nby one, you find yourself\nmore and more entrapped\nin the ever-weaving web\nthat is the story of Agent\n47\u2019s past and what will\nbecome of his future.\nGameplay:\nHave you ever wanted\nto murder a person by\na) simply shooting them\nb) throwing them off a\nbuilding or c) dropping\na plastic shark on them?\nThen you\u2019re in luck, as\nyou have all of the above\navailable in just one\nmission, with plenty of\nwackier ways of killing\nyour target including\nrigging a safety test for\na fighter jet to cause the\nperson to be ejected into\nthe air.\nWorried you don\u2019t have\nthe time or imagination\nto think up the most\nelaborate and crazy assassinations to pull off? Have\nno fear, the game provides\nyou with some story objectives for each different\nmission. In essence, the\ngame guides you on how\nto pull off elaborate plots,\nsuch as getting a prototype\nmilitary robot to assassinate the target for you.\nWhile the game tells you\nthe gist of what you need\nto do, you\u2019re given some\nfreedom to complete the\nobjectives in any way\nyou see fit. The system is\nintuitive and helps tell you\nhow to pull off all sorts\nof crazy schemes with\nunintuitive steps. All in\nall, it\u2019s a nice way to kill\ncreatively if you\u2019re short\non time or don\u2019t have the\nimagination to think up\ncrazy schemes.\nBecause there are so\nmany ways to take down\nyour targets, this means\nthat all the missions, and\nthe game as a whole, has\ngreat replay value. Each\nmission has a galore of\ndifferent unique challeng-es, such as assassinating\nsomeone in their sleep,\nstabbing in the shower\naka Alfred Hitchcock\nstyle, and more. The game\ndoesn\u2019t tell you how to\ndo the challenges, only\nthe end result; this means\nyou\u2019re free to approach\nand tackle them in any\nway you want. Overall,\nreplaying missions feels\nlike a unique experience\nevery time, as opposed\nto seeming like a chore\nas with most games,\n*cough* replaying\nherding missions in\nRDR2.\nThe game doesn\u2019t stop,\nwith fun features like its\nstandalone sniper mode.\nSituated at a vantage\npoint, you have to shoot\noff targets at a distance\nin all their ragdoll glory.\nEven here, there are different challenges for you\nto replay the mission and\nplay with different styles.\nUnfortunately, there is\nonly one sniper mode\nmission at the moment\nwhich is a bit of let-down\nas you\u2019ll be eliminating\nthe same targets and\nworking with the same\nscenery over and over\nagain. In addition to this,\nsome of the challenges\nrequire very precise\ntiming and sharpshooting\nwhich can test even the\nmost patient of gamers.\nDespite its drawbacks,\nsniper mode is still a\nfun addition to the game\nwhich contrasts from the\nstandard missions.\nUnfortunately, I cannot\ncomment on the multiplayer aspect because\nthe onlines features were\nnot yet available in the\npress copy of the game I\nreceived.\nThe Verdict:\nFor those wanting a bit\nmore extra fun, Hitman 2\ncomes with an included\nremaster of the previous\ngame built in for those\nwho owned the previous\ngame, or you\u2019re given an\noption of paying \u00a315 for\nthe GOTY legacy pack,\nwhich has a list of bene-fits, including the previous game completely\nremastered in the Hitman\n2 engine.\nOverall, Hitman 2 is\na very fun game and a\nwelcome addition to the\nfranchise. The intuitive\nguidance system and\nthe ability to choose\nthe means of killing the\ntarget helps makes the\nexperience an utter blast,\nand gives you a more\nthan satisfactory choice\nmechanism in a way that\nTelltale games were never\nable to master. Honestly,\nit is worth dressing up as\na flamingo and throwing\nsoda cans at people to\nknock them out, even if\nthe approach makes you\nfail a few times. Seeing\nyour elaborate killing\nschemes work out in the\nend just makes this game\nworth it.\nIn another addition to the Hitman series, Agent 47 returns, bringing with him years of tactical experience and a\ngalore of interesting but lethal tactics!\nThe return of the versatile assasin// Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment\n\n"

    "content": "First Man: Review\n*Spoiler Alert: THEY LANDED ON THE MOON!*\nD\nirected by\nD a m i e n\nChazelle and\nstarring Ryan\nGosling and Claire Foy (as\nNeil and Janet Armstrong\nrespectively), First Man is\nan impressive depiction of\nthe moon landing. Damien\nChazelle opted for a very\nrealistic and grounded approach when tackling this\ngroundbreaking event.\nUsing nearly exclusively\nhandheld camera, the film\nlooked and felt more like\na documentary than a 21st\ncentury blockbuster. The\nfilm does its best not to\nglorify spacefaring,;in-stead it provides us a\nvery realistic look at what\nthe astronauts had to go\nthrough for mankind to\ntouch the moon. In fact,\nthe film actively shows\nus how underprepared\neverything is, from\nhaving to do last-minute\nengineering on a seatbelt\nbuckle using a Swiss\nArmy knife, to how the\ncapsule that was supposed\nto carry the astronauts into\nspace looked like it was\ngoing to fall apart at any\ntime.\nOn top of that, the\ndirector\u2019s decision to frequently use close-ups and\nfirst person perspective\nshots effectively thrusts\nthe audience into the\nshoes of Neil Armstrong.\nThe audience feels the intensity of every shudder,\nevery tumble and every\nturn of the spacecraft that\nArmstrong felt through\nthe camera and sound\ndesign. My stomach\nchurned when Armstrong\nhad to stabilise the thingy\nthat spins really really fast\n(formally known as the\nmulti-axis spin test inertia\nfacility), and my hair stood\nup as the metal envelope\nof the spacecrafts creaked\nand groaned in high-pitch\nshrieks.\nThe understated and\nauthentic performances of\nGosling and Foy augment\nthe film in every way.\nThey draw the audience\ninto the 140-minute saga;\nthey are the anchors that\nground the film of such\nscope and ambition. They\ncarry along with them the\nvery sincere emotional\ncore of the film - the\ntragic loss of the Arm\u201cThey draw\nthe audience\ninto the\n140-minute\nsaga; they are\nthe anchors\nthat ground\nthe film of\nsuch scope and\nambition!\u201d\n\u201cUltimately,\nFirst Man is a\nspectacular,\ntouching,\nand human\ncelebration of\nhumainity\u2019s\ngreatest\nstrengths!\u201d\nstrong\u2019s daughter When\nArmstrong is shown,\nstanding on the Moon,\nwhen the Earth is only the\nsize of a golf ball to him,\nhis daughter\u2019s death links\nhim back to his home and\nhis family. Throughout\nthe film, Armstrong has\navoided confronting his\ndaughter\u2019s death, and\nhas refused to talk about\nit with anyone around\nhim, including his wife.\nIt is only when he lands\non the desolate faraway\nlandscape of the Moon,\nsurrounded by silence and\nemptiness, that he gains\nthe catharsis he desperately needs. The shot of\nArmstrong standing alone\non the moon, with all the\nvastness of space behind\nhim, and dropping his\ndaughter\u2019s bracelet into\nthe depths of a crater, in\nmy opinion, is the most\npowerful moment of the\nfilm. We do not know\nwhether Armstrong really\ndid that in real life, but\nit is a perfect conclusion\nto the emotional turmoil\nexperienced in the Armstrong household. Without\nthe two strong leads, this\nmoment would not have\nworked.\nThis film is relentlessly\ncentred on Armstrong\u2019s\nperspective. In fact, rarely\nare there any scenes\nwithout Neil Armstrong.\nThis is effective in\nconfining us within the\nheadspace of Armstrong.\nThis is sometimes at the\nexpense of competent\ncast members who are\ncriminally underused.\nFrom Jason Clarke, Kyle\nChandler to Ciar\u00e1n Hinds\nand Corey Stoll, while\nthe actors and the characters they portray are\nequally significant in the\nmoon-landing process,\ntheir presence is never felt\nmaily in fleeting cameos.\nEven Janet Armstrong,\nbrilliant as Claire Foy,\ndoes not feel like a solid\npresence in the film.\nThese supporting characters feel insignificant\nto the story as the film\nWarning: this film contains surprisingly little jazz. // IMDb\nISSUE 1705\nFELIX\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFILM\nAidan Chan\nFilm Editor\nDir: Damien Chazelle\nScript: Josh Singer, James\nR Hansen. Starring: Ryan\nGosling, Claire Foy.\n141 minutes\nFIRST MAN\n\u201cThe film\ndoes its best\nnot to glorify\nspacefaring;\ninstead, it\nprovides us a\nvery realistic\nlook at what\nthe astronauts\nhad to go\nthrough for\nmankind to\ntouch the\nmoon\u201d\nnever shows us how these\ncharacters influenced Neil\nArmstrong. The character\ndeaths scattered through\nthe film, for example, the\ndeath of Ed White, one of\nNeil Armstrong\u2019s closest\nfriends, never really\nreinforces Armstrong\u2019s\nwill to go to the Moon\nor make him doubt the\nworth of space program. It\nfeels like these deaths are\nnecessary additions just\nfor historical accuracy\u2019s\nsake, instead of essential\ncharacter moments.\nThe film also sacrifices\nmany opportunities to\nhave a more in-depth discussion of the necessity\nof space programs. Along\nthe way, the film touches\non the socioeconomic\nimplications of space\nprograms. It tries to raise\nthe issue of: Is winning\nthe space race worth the\nbillions of taxpayers\u2019\nmoney and the many lives\nof talented people? Often\nthese these thought-pro-voking questions are\nskimmed over in a short\nmontage before more\ndazzling rocket launches.\nHaving said so, these\nrather nitpicky flaws do\nnot affect the film\u2019s enjoy-ability in any significant\nway. Ultimately, First\nMan is a spectacular,\ntouching, and human\ncelebration of humanity\u2019s\ngreatest strengths.\n\n"

Turns\nout Florida and Georgia\nhaven\u2019t even counted all\ntheir ballots (Broward\nCounty, who would\u2019ve\nthought? Oh, right...).\nIn the GA race, Kemp\njust straight-up tried to\nhide 30,000 ballots - and\nhis office lied about\nhow many uncounted\nballots there were. And\nprovisional votes are\nstill screwed up (a judge\nhas ordered a recount of\nall provisional ballots).\nAbrams is damn close\nto triggering a general\nrecount.\nThe GA race was\nfilthy. People were\nqueueing for hours to\nvote; turns out thousands\nof voting machines were\nleft in their packaging\nin a warehouse, instead\nof being brought out to\npolling places which had\na shortage. Gee, wonder\nwhy that is; Kemp\u2019s a\ngood boy, isn\u2019t he?\nIn Florida, my guy\nGillum un-conceded\n(it\u2019s informal, but Rs\nare screeching \u201cno\ntakesies-backsies!\u201d) and\nis in close contention\n(or at least could force\na recount). Marco Rubio\n(who eats with his ass\nand shits out his mouth)\nhas claimed Democrats\nare trying to \u201csteal the\nelection\u201d by counting\nvotes; in other words,\nthey\u2019re being deliberately disingenuous. Fuck\nthese people.\nThe Kremlin\u2019s own\nDana Rohrabacher\n(R-CA) is out; Dems\nhave picked up a few\nHouse races previously called for Dems.\nFiveThirtyEight forecasts the uncalled races\nas going predominantly\nto Dems for a net gain\nof 38 seats; the situation\nis ameliorating from\nelection night.\nThe South Carolina\nraces were crooked as\nfuck.

Or, as\nthe conservatives say,\n\u201cit\u2019s a republic, not a\ndemocracy,\u201d because\nquoting the morons in\ncharge seems to these\nCHUDs to be more\nlogical than reiterating\na basic commitment to\nfair elections - y\u2019know,\nthe fucking basics in a\ndemocracy.\nQuite impressively,\ndown-ballot races in\nTexas went solidly blue.\nEvery Republican judge\n(59 in all) was unseated\nin the last race, thanks\nto slate voting options.\nThe Beto hype was real;\nTexas could go purple in\n2020. The future is now!\nIn other news, Clinton\nhas emerged from her\ncompound, her army\nof yes-men flunkies in\ntrail, whispering sweet\nnothings that Ohio will\nbe hers in 2020.

The Mueller\nprobe has been roused\nfrom its electoral\nslumber; Jerome Corsi\nis due to be indicted for\nperjury.

Fucking nitwit.\nHe hasn\u2019t tweeted about\nthe Caravan since the\nelection since - get\nthis - rhetoric about\na nebulous, specious\nforeign threat is used\nby Trump to stoke voter\nturnout among racists.\nTroops have been stationed in Texas at the\nborder to intercept the\nCaravan; they have no\npower, no hot meals, are\nsleeping in tent cities,\nand will miss Thanksgiving (which has made\nmany a neolib indignant\n- I for one love celebrating genocide). Too bad\nthe Caravan is going to\nCalifornia, you moron.\nTrump\u2019s also awarded\nthe medal of freedom\nto the wife of one of his\nbiggest donors, because,\ny\u2019know, the concept of\nmoral commitment is\nalien to this administra-tion.\nTrump\u2019s cocooned\nhimself in sorrow,\nbunking off Veteran\u2019s\nDay commitments to eat\ncheeseburgers, watch\nTV, and sob about the\nwalls closing in.

And so, on Friday\n2nd\nNovember, 15 of\nLondon\u2019s finest and\nrowdiest decided to travel\nto Imperial\u2019s infamous\nSt Mary\u2019s Mountain Hut\nin Rhyd-Ddu, Northern\nWales, the international\nhub for sheep-herding and\ntrail running.\nSetting off after\nlectures, labs, work or\nsimply a Friday of grazing\nafter core, the group hit\nthe road at around 5:30\nin the evening, hoping\nto reach their destination\nbefore midnight, scrapping the beloved Aldi pit\nstop from the planning to\nsave time. After a quick\nstop on the motorway to\ngrab dinner and logs, they\narrived at the hut pretty\nmuch on time, delighted\nto find their refuge for the\nnight, dry and surprisingly\nnot too cold and went to\nbed, with high hopes for a\nwonderful weekend away\nfrom the city.\nCame Saturday\nmorning, and a few alarms\nlater, each and every one\ngot out of bed, had a quick\nbreakfast of mainly carbs\nandpeanutbutter,androde\nthe minibus to the Electric\nMountain car park, at the\nfoot of Mount Snowdon.\nSurprised to see most\nbusinesses closed due to\nstrong winds and heavy\nrain, the group of fearless\nrunners didn\u2019t look back\nand set off on the Llanberis path in direction of\nthe summit. However,\nthe winds quickly started\nblowing at an impressive\n70mph on the steep and\nrocky path, so after the\nhalf-way mark, some of\nthe runners decided to\nstay on the safe side and\ngo back, while the most\ncourageous/foolish opted\nto push through the wind,\nsometimes on all fours,\nto make it to the top.\nDespite the conditions\nbeing hostile to say the\nleast, they made it to the\ntop of the 1085m high\ngiant and back, and the\nsquad regrouped in a caf\u00e9\nin the village to enjoy a\nwarm and dry moment\nto recover from their first\nadventure of the day.\nOnce back to the hut,\na general atmosphere of\nrecovery took over while\nmost runners decided to\nget warm by the fire, have\nsome more lunch, get in\na change of warm, dry\nclothes and have a nice cup\nof tea. However, ex-trail\ncaptain Henry Hart and\nall-round legend Charlie\nMcFadzean decided it\nwas the perfect moment to\ngo exploring again in the\ncloser mountains as they\nset off for their second\nrun of the day. An hour\nand a lot of rain later, the\npair returned to the hut to\nshower as they called it a\nday and decided in turn\nto change into their warm\nclothes for the afternoon.\nLater on, the genersl\nconsensus was to go to the\npub for a few rewarding\ndrinks, so as most of\nthe valiant girls, led by\nwomen\u2019scaptainCharlotte\nBarratt, ran there despite\nthe terrible wind and hail,\nthe rest of the group took\nthe minibus for the 3km\njourney, separating them\nfrom the Cwellyn Arms,\na fine establishment\nclaiming to serve 9 real\nales 9 days a week \u2013 you\njust can\u2019t go wrong\nwith that. After mulled\nwine, Snowdonia Ale,\nand whiskey and chips\nduring Wales\u2019 impressive\nwin over Scotland in\ntheir match of the Rugby\nAutumn Internationals,\nthe group headed home in\nthe evening for dinner and\nmore fun.\nGoing only upwards\nfrom the biscuit game,\nthe ever-intellectual-ly-stimulating games\nanimal- then city-alphabet\nwere brought to an end\nby trail captain Henry\nMaynard\u2019s delicious Chili\ncon carne, and rice con\npesto for non-meat eaters.\nAfter dinner, a few beers,\nand once everyone had\nshowered, the team then\nwent on to play the mysterious game of the Mafiosi,\nfeaturing interesting\nplaylists and narrating\nchoices. As the night went\non, most were quite tired\nso we all went to bed in\nour sleeping bags, looking\nforward to another day of\ntrail running, with hopefully more convenient\nweather.\nJust as the early bird\ncatches the worm, the\nearly runner makes the\nmost of Wales\u2019 wonderful\ntrail paths. And so, with\nthe wind having calmed\ndown overnight, a 13-strong team headed to\nLlyn Cwellyn to go up\nSnowdonia once again,\nbut this time up the\nsteeper Ranger\u2019s path.\nAfter reaching Llyn\nFfynnon-y-gwas, the path\nbecame much rockier and\nsteeper. With the previous\nday\u2019s 1km vertical gain in\ntheir legs, most of the trail\nrunners dropped the pace\non the path that featured a\ngruelling 600m elevation\ngain over a less than 3km\ndistance. With all that had\nset off making it to the\nsummit, they then headed\nback to the minibus as the\nsky started to get clearer.\nAfter making it back\nto the hut, the team had a\nquick lunch and showers,\npacked their gear and got\nready to board the minibus\nto head back to London,\ntired but jolly after an all-round wonderful weekend\nin the land where sheep\noutnumber people.\nIf you are interested in\ntaking part in our activ-ities, join our Facebook\ngroup or email run@ic.ac.\nuk.\nBevs with the boys // ICXCAC\nFRIDAY, 16TH\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n40\nBarratt Power // ICXCAC\n(S)quad goals // ICXCAC\n\n"

Kamikaze was released on the final day of\nAugust this year, marking\nhis shortest recording\nperiod in between albums.\nBillboard likened the\nalbum\u2019s commercial success to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2013\nself-titled studio album,\nalso released without\npre-announcement to\ncritical acclaim. The\ncomparison becomes unfounded given Eminem\u2019s\ntrack record of success,\nwith his last 8 studio\nalbums (out of 10) topping\nthe US and UK charts in\naddition to several other\ncountries.\nAt 45 minutes and 49\nseconds, Kamikaze is\nEminem\u2019s second shortest\nalbum in duration, only\nabout 7 minutes longer\nthan his debut album\nInfinite back in 1996.\nUnlike the 2017 predecessor Revival which featured\nprominent modern artists\n(Beyonc\u00e9, Ed Sheeran,\nAlicia Keys, Kehlani,\nP!nk), Kamikaze featured\nonly two rappers and\nJessie Reyez (credited for\nwriting Calvin Harris and\nDua Lipa\u2019s \u2018One Kiss\u2019) in\na total of 13 tracks.\nThe album\u2019s core theme\nis to diss present generation of mumble rappers\nas Eminem maintains his\nsuperiority on his inten-sity, speed and rhyming\nwhile delivering his tune.\nCurrent U.S. President\nDonald Trump gets a\nmention in the opening\ntrack \u2018The Ringer\u2019, whom\nhe also lashed on in a freestyle rap during the 2017\nBET Hip Hop Awards.\n\u2018The Greatest\u2019and \u2018Lucky\nYou\u2019 heavily disses\nrappers including Joe\nBudden, Tyler the Creator,\nJa Rule, Drake and even\nSouth African band Die\nAntwoord. He denotes the\nphrase \u201cmumble rap\u201d for\nrappers who showed little\nflair in rap vocabulary\nand intensity, in contrast\nwith his powerful vocal\ndelivery. During an early\nSeptember interview with\nSway Calloway about his\nlatest album, he admits\ndissing them for variety\nof reasons \u2013 mostly on\nbelow-par rappers who\nhave the cheek to criticise\nhis works and re-ignition\nof several past feuds.\nEminem certainly\ndoesn\u2019t need introduction\non his rapping tempo. If\nyou thought his \u201csupersonic speed\u201d section in\n\u2018Rap God\u2019 was insane\nwith a record of 101\nwords in 16.45 seconds,\nEminem seemingly broke\nhis own record during his\nmesmerising second verse\nin \u2018Lucky You\u2019 where\nwithin a 16-second part\nhe managed to rap about\n110 words. In that track he\ncollaborated with Joyner\nLucas, an underrated Massachusetts rapper who had\na gripping rap panache of\nhis own. Joyner concurred\nwith Eminem\u2019s notion of\n\u201clesser rappers getting the\nattention\u201d by alluding \u201call\nmy life, I want a Grammy\n/ but I\u2019ll probably never\nget it\u201d in his lines. A\nrepentant Eminem admits\n\u201cselling his soul to win\nsome Grammys in his\npast\u201d in the subsequent\nverse. Eminem also\nreunited with fellow Bad\nMeets Evil partner Royce\nda 5\u20199\u201d (famed for \u2018Fast\nLane\u2019 and \u2018Lighters\u2019\nwith Bruno Mars) in the\ntrack \u2018Not Alike\u2019, dissing\nrapper Machine Gun\nKelly (MGK) who last\nyear shot to fame with his\nsingle \u2018Bad Things\u2019 with\nCamila Cabello.\nAs the album goes on,\nlisteners may find the tone\nand rhythm becoming a\ntad repetitive while the\ndissing theme fades. The\ntitle track \u2018Kamikaze\u2019\nand \u2018Fall\u2019 focuses more\non Eminem\u2019s frustration\nat his last album, Revival\nreceiving poor reviews\nand critics. The penultimate tracks \u2018Nice Guy\u2019\nand \u2018Good Guy\u2019 featuring\nup-and-coming singer\nJessie Reyez shifts to\nthemes about trying to be\nthe nice guy in baffling\nrelationships. The final\ntrack \u2018Venom\u2019 is a motion\npicture soundtrack from\nthe freshly released Tom\nHardy movie, which\nEminem references\nheavily.\nThe diss tracks certainly collected attentions of\nthe name-dropped artists,\nmost notably MGK who\ntweeted about Eminem\u2019s\ndaughter Hailie \u201cbeing\nhot\u201d back in 2012 (another\nreason to not fuck with\nDad). MGK is the only\nartist who responded with\na full track \u2018Rap Devil\u2019\nalludingtoEminem\u2019s\u2018Rap\nGod\u2019. Eminem recorded\nhis comeback \u2018Killshot\u2019\nwithin two weeks but was\nreluctant to \u2018popularise\u2019\nMGK with the response\ntrack, as quoted in the\nsame Sway interview.\nAs of this writing, the\n\u2018Killshot\u2019 audio track\nhas amassed 177 million\nviews on YouTube, almost\n24 million more than\nMGK\u2019s \u2018Rap Devil\u2019music\nvideo released in the\nsame period. Like most\nof his previous albums,\nKamikaze does not shy\naway from controversies\nregarding his alleged\nhomophobic lyrics. He\ndid apologise for \u201cgoing\ntoo far\u201d but in truth this is\nnothing new regarding his\nstyle for die-hard fans.\nIn a nutshell, Kamikaze\nmay not be his best work\nto date, but at 46, Eminem\nshows no signs of slowing\ndown and is still at the top\nof his game. If he keeps\nproducing records while\ncasting other artists in the\nlimelight, none of us will\nbe able to keep him away\nfrom the music spotlight.\nIn early September BBC\nnews suggested the\n\u201cgreatest\u201d rapper should\nconsider quitting while\nstill in his prime. Until\nthen, guess who\u2019s back,\nback again?\nShouldn\u2019t this be a Zero? // Aftermath\nMUSIC\nJ.Y. Gan\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Eminem. Label:\nAftermath; Interscope;\nShady.

    "content": "Wildlife photography for all levels of expertise\nNature photographers\nfrom all over the world\nsubmitted their works to\nthe Wildlife Photographer\nof the Year contest. From\nthese, a jury of photo-journalists, biologists\nand editors chose the\nbest shots across seventeen categories, now on\ndisplay. The result is a\nbreathtaking exhibition\nwith the power to awe, to\nmove and to disturb.\nIt is clear that a lot of\ncare was taken to ensure\nthe photographs were\npresented at their best.\nEach is set in a light panel\nagainst a dark, minimalist\nbackground, positioned\nat eye-level in a large\nsize, big enough to be\nfully appreciated on its\nown. All in a low light\nenvironment \u2013 collisions\nwith other visitors are part\nof the fun! \u2013 with delicate,\nnature-evoking ambient\nmusic.\nThe structure of the exhibition is simple and in-tuitive. One moves swiftly\nfrom one section to the\nother, with clear information panels marking the\ntransitions. These provide\nadditional information on\nthe focus of each section,\nthe sub-categories and the\njudging criteria. An initial\noval corridor is followed\nby a branching gallery,\nwith the two grand-prize\nwinners closing the show.\nOverall it shouldn\u2019t take\nmuch longer than an\nhour to see, but no rest is\nprovided along the way:\nonly the last two pictures\nmerit the honour of an \u2018art\nappreciation bench\u2019.\nApart from the pictures\nthemselves, one of the\nstrongest aspects of the\nwhole exhibition are the\ncaptions. For the aspiring\nnature photographers,\ntechnical details on\ncameras, lenses and\naccessories used are\nprovided. For those who\nare choosing their next\nexotic travel destination,\nmaps and locations are\navailable. Naturalists will\nlearn about the subject,\nspecific behaviour,\nbiological interaction or\nhabitat depicted. And\nthe rest of us won\u2019t stay\nindifferent to the amazing\nstories behind each pho-tograph, nor to the effort\ntheir authors put to them.\nMud rolling, ice trekking\nand deep sea diving to\ntake a photograph can\nonly be classified as\npassion, and that feeling\npermeates every picture.\nReferences to habitat\nloss, endangered species\nand climate change are\nnot uncommon, subtly\nreminding the viewers\nthat they might be looking\nat natural relics, and educating us as to the need for\nconservational efforts.\nAs for the stars of the\nshow, the photographs,\nthey are a rich display of\nnature\u2019s uniqueness. From\ntiny microorganisms to\nhuge deserts, the exhibition covers every scale of\nthe natural world. Some\nof the images are fasci-natingly disgusting, such\nas one depicting a lizard\npeeping out of a carcass\u2019s\nempty eye socket. Others\nare almost abstract and\nsupernatural, such as a\ncolorful composition with\nalgae, or a hummingbird\nat a surprising angle.\nOthers, and curiously\nthe great-winners fall\ninto this category, depict\nanimal subjects in a very\nhuman-like fashion,\nappealing to our natural\nempathy and striking\npowerful emotions.\nAt the end, we leave\namazed by our world\u2019s\nwonders, and perhaps\na bit more inclined to\nprotect them.\nWhite Teeth\nWhen White Teeth was\npublished back in 2000,\nby a hitherto-unknown,\nfresh-out-of-Cambridge\nZadie Smith, it added a\nfresh perspective to the\ngathering conversation\nabout Britain\u2019s cultural di-versity. Smith was different because she actually\ngrew up in the melting\npot of race, religion and\nculture in Willesden, as a\nhalf-Jamaican, half-white\nyouth. Her novel doesn\u2019t\nstray far: set in the same\narea, White Teeth follows\nthe families of two men\n\u2013 one Bangladeshi, one\nEnglish \u2013 who had become\nbest mates after fighting in\nthe war together.\nIt is thus significant\nthat the first stage adaptation of White Teeth was\npresented at the newly-re-furbished Kiln Theatre\n(former Tricycle Theatre),\nin the heart of Kilburn.\nThe raucous Kilburn High\nRoad of the play, cartoon-ishly reconstructed on\nstage by Tom Piper, is the\nvery street on which the\ntheatre stands. The play\nis filled with bold, bright\ncharacters that strut across\nthe stage, bumping into\neach other, interacting\n\u2013 preserving the chaotic\ndiversity that is central to\nits theme.\nIn the midst of the\nstories of the two families\nlies a commentary on\nBritain\u2019s relationship with\nthe diverse cultures that\nhave made her their home,\neach changing, and being\nchanged, by the other. The\nplay uses the disillusioned\ndentist Rosie, who is sent\ninto a coma-dream by the\n\u201clocal fruit-and-nutcase\u201d\nMad Mary via an anaesthetic overdose, to explore\nher mother Irie\u2019s past and\nthe mystery of her father\u2019s\nidentity. Irie, the daughter\nof a Jamaican mother\nand English father, grew\nup with the Bangladeshi\ntwins Magid and Millat\nIqbal in multicultural\nWillesden. The twins\u2019\nfather, Samad, is a devout\nBangladeshi Muslim who\nfelt his faith slipping\naway from his children\u2019s\nlives. He sends Magid\nback to Bangladesh in\nan attempt to remedy\nthis, and the twins follow\nvastly different paths;\nMillat in London becomes\ninvolved with the militant\nfundamentalist Islamic\nbrotherhood KEVIN,\nwhile Magid in Bangladesh pledges his life to\nscience and, specifically,\ngenetic engineering.\nWhite Teeth has a\nmind-boggling number of\ncharacters, each with their\nown story that intertwines\nwith the others, crossing\nover in a multitude of\nways that bring out both\nclashes of cultures but\nalso the amalgamation of\ndifferent practices that is\nunique to London. As a\nLondoner watching the\nplay, one is often tickled\nby the references to the\ndiversity we take for\ngranted \u2013 such as the Irish\npool hall, O\u2019Connell\u2019s,\nthat Samad and Archie\nfrequent, which is run by\nArabs and does not have\nany pool tables.\nThe play is peppered\nwith Paul Englishby\u2019s\nfeel-good tunes, with\ncolourful Hairspray-esque mass choreography.\nThere is a particularly\nimpressive sequence in\na hot pink hairdresser\u2019s\nas pink characters swivel\naround and sing about\nIrie\u2019s wish to straighten\nher Afro curls. The small\nacoustic band plays live\nfor the songs, with the\nmusicians occasionally\nparticipating as side char-acters. Some have said\nthat the conviviality of\nthe show masks some of\nthe subtleties of Smith\u2019s\nstory. Indeed, without a\nnarrator to tie the multiple\nthreads together, the play\ncan seem unfocused.\nPerhaps it has sacrificed\nsome nuances for a relat-able, generally feel-good\nproduction, but it is enjoyable in the way a West\nEnd musical is enjoyable\n\u2013 a visual feast presented\nby an impressive cast,\nbuilt on a conversation\nabout cultural diversity so\nrelevant in Britain today.\n\u2018The Golden Couple\u2019: 2018\u2019s winner // Marsel van Oosten\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 16th\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\n26\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nMaria Portela\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "ISSUE 1705\nFELIX\n23\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPain and Polyamory\nP\nride and\nPrejudice, Sense\nand Sensibility,\nEmma; these classic Jane Austen novels are\nprobably very familiar to\nthe well-read student body\nat Imperial. However,\nthe Austentatious theatre\ncompany brings some of\nher long lost (never writ-ten) works to the stage\nusing the art of improv.\nAt the beginning of\nevery show the audience\nsuggests a title to a lost\nnovel, and a 2 hour long\nperformance of improvised hilarity then ensues!\nNo two shows are alike\nand at this performance,\nsome hilarious titles were\nsuggested: \u2018North End\nAbbey Road\u2019, a Beatles\nthemed Jane Austen\nnovel; \u2018Gay Pride and\nPrejudice\u2019, Jane Austen\nin 2018; even \u2018MeToo\nMr. Darcy\u2019 \u2013 a chillingly\npertinent title considering recent headlines.\nHowever, the lost novel\nperformed was the family\nfavourite: \u2018Pain and Polyamory\u2019.\nOnce the title was\nchosen, the large box on\nstage was opened to the\nsound of old-timey Austenesque music played by\ntwo improv musicians on\nthe right of the stage. It\nrevealed a simple yet versatile set design \u2013 a 19th\ncentury decorated room.\nDuring the show, the\nactors found increasingly\ncreative ways of making\nthis room into a bedroom,\nliving room, church and\neven a sex dungeon. The\nonly props the actors\nhad to work with were a\ncouple of chairs, a scarf,\nand a round table (which\nspent much of its time\nas a font in the village\nchurch). Any other props\nhad to be imagined by\nboth the audience and\nthe actors. The hilarity in\nseeing someone read an\nimaginary book or ride\nan imaginary horse seems\ninfantile but worked perfectly with the audience\nerupting into laughter\n(spin the bottle but with\nmore sex) hosted by\nMr Spencer (Graham\nDickson) and meet\nColonel Quincy (Andrew\nHunter Murray) and\nMalcolm Bobson (son of\nBob Bobson, portrayed by\nDaniel Nils Roberts).\nAfter a night of disgraceful behaviour, some\ncharacters start to question\ntheir actions and get\nreprimanded by the town\nvicar (Joseph Morpurgo).\nMany scenes later, after a\nlot of drama and a quick\ntrip down to the Prince\nRegent\u2019s torture garden\nin London for some more\ndebauchery, the story\ncomes to an end.\nOne area which was\ndefinitely lacking was the\nplot. In certain scenes, the\nactors probably needed\nsomeone to download Citymapper onto their phones\nas they were lost with no\nidea what direction to go.\nThis would usually result\nin some meaningless conversation happening until\nthe lights would go down,\nsignifying the scene was\nover. This being said, due\nto the improvised nature\nof the performance, the\naudience did not come\nfor plot as much as they\ndid for cheap laughs \u2013\nwhich were definitely\nnot lacking! Ms. Amy\nCooke-Hodgson who\nplayed Laetitia was the\nstar of the show in this\nrespect, coming out with\nhysterically witty one-lin-ers. She would often burst\nonto stage, interrupting\nthe scene with a quick\none-liner and then scurry\noff \u2013 her impeccable\ntiming would leave both\nthe audience and some-imally (maybe a scarf\naround the head), the\nvoice, the tone and the\nmannerisms made it\nclear what character was\non stage. Dickson and\nRoberts stuck to the same\ncharacters throughout,\nwhich was rather disappointing as it did not\ngive them room to shine.\nEven though they did\nboth deliver many funny\nlines, the other actors\nsuch as Cooke-Hodgson\nand Morpurgo outshone\nthem in this particular\nperformance.\nOverall, the performance was effective in\nkeeping the audience\ngiggling, laughing, and\neven crying from the\ningenious dialogue. This\nwas made all the funnier\nperformed in the prim\nand proper English of 19th\ncentury Britain.

    "content": "Microtransactions: the covert gambling ring of the\ngaming community\nThe publisher of FIFA is preparing to sue the Belgian government in international court over legislation designed\nto prevent children being able to gamble. How have we ended up here, and where will the industry go now?\nGAMES\nAnthony Onwuli\nGames Editor\nT\nhe gambling accusation refers to\nloot boxes, effectively Pok\u00e9mon\nbooster packs for in-game\ncosmetics and perks.\nMuch like card packs,\nmost of the contents are\ncommon trash, but there is\nalways potential of finding\nsomething rare and flashy\nthat you can show off.\nFundamentally, both card\npacks and lootboxes play\non the same risk-reward\nsystem of slot machines,\nand as such they can\ntrigger the same addiction\nreactions in people. Now,\ngambling in itself is fine,\nand the question of whether lootboxes should exist\nat all is a complicated\none. The unambiguous\nissue arises when they are\nprominent in games with\nhuge young playerbases.\nFortnite and Overwatch\nare two obvious examples\nof games that hit wide\ndemographic ranges\nwhile hiding their items\nin boxes behind paywalls.\nFor an adult with financial\nindependence, it\u2019s up to\nthem to decide how they\nspend their money, but\nthe \u201cneed\u201d to buy these\nitems is a lot stronger for\nimpressionable kids and\nteens. If everyone around\nthem and everyone they\nwatch online has cool\nitems, they\u2019re going to\nwant to get them too, and\nso often find themselves\npouring huge amounts\nof money into these loot\nboxes. These kids are\nlearning what it feels like\nto gamble.\nBut why, then, did EA\nand Battlefront burst the\nbubble and lead legislatures on the subject? They\npushed the system too far\nand broke their game in\nservice of lootboxes. See,\nlootboxes are a symptom\nof a growing problem in\nthe games industry. Publishers try to extract every\nbit of money possible\nfrom every game. A game\ncan\u2019t just be profitable; it\nhas to be the most profitable game on the market.\nThis is why you might feel\nsome games have been\n\u201cdumbed down\u201d over\ntime. You\u2019re probably not\nwrong, simpler games can\nappeal to more people.\nOver time these money\ngrabbing practices have\nbecome more and more\nanti-consumer. It used\nto be that you would sell\na game then produce\nDLC (downloadable\ncontent) down the line\nfor a secondary income\nboost. Then publishers\nstarted realising that they\ncould make even more\nmoney by producing this\ncontent before the game\nis released while the\ndevelopers are in crunch\nand waiting a few weeks\nbefore flogging it. Finally,\nthey moved to carving\ncontent out of completed\ngames and selling them\nas DLC down the line and\neven on day one. Memorably, Mass Effect 3 had\ntwo quite pivotal story\nmissions walled off in this\nway. And if you want the\nworst example, track the\never more ludicrous world\nof digital deluxe and\nspecial editions.\nBut with microtrans-actions you don\u2019t really\nneed to make any more\nmeaningful content, and\nif they\u2019re in the form of\nloot boxes you can tempt\nplayers to spend far more\nthan if they just bought\nwhat they wanted directly.\nMicrotransactions started\ncropping up in triple A\ngames a few years ago,\nand have now spread like\na plague. It started as a\nway to sell cosmetics for\nmultiplayer modes, a little\nbit of bonus revenue to\npay for servers, but has\nnow escalated to the point\nwhere single player experiences are having their\ngameplay loops destroyed\nin order to facilitate\nselling hapless consumer\nexperience boosters and\nitem packs. If you were\nwondering why the new\nAssassins Creed games\nhave switched to a stat\nbased loot and level\nsystem, it was to facilitate\nthe 7 pages of purchasable\nupgrades and boosters\nyou see in Odyssey. All\nin service of extracting\nevery last dime they can.\nAnd here we come\nto how Battlefront.\nLootboxes playing on the\naddiction centres of children\u2019s brains is an ethical\nissue, but it was only\nthrown into focus because\nof how far Battlefront\noverstepped the line. The\nentire progression system\nwas linked to a slow drip\nfeed of free lootboxes, but\nof course you were more\nthan welcome to pay for\nthem yourself. However,\nto unlock all content in\nthe \u00a340 game you already\npaid for, you would need\naround 4500 hours of\nplay, or \u00a31700 of lootbox-es. This system existed\nspecifically so that no\nmatter how long the game\nlasted, every player would\nalways have a reason to\nbuy just one more box.\nThe fan reaction was\ncatastrophic. When, on\nReddit, a spokesperson\nfor EA tried to explain\nhow the system hoped to\ngive players a sense of\n\u201cpride and accomplishment\u201d with every unlock,\nit became the most down\nvoted comment in Reddit\nhistory. The outrage\nwas so immediate, so\nuniversal, and so vocal,\nDisney threatened to take\nthe Star Wars licence\naway from EA for fear\nof them damaging the\nbrand. Suddenly governments across the world\nwoke up to the fact that\nthis gambling was going\non under their noses.\nBelgium was just the first\ncountry to legislate, but\nmany are investigating as\nwe speak. EA can\u2019t afford\nto let this legislation set a\nprecedent. For years their\nFIFA series has raked\nin hundreds of millions\nof dollars from people\nbuying latest games then\nlater buying hundreds\nof card packs to rebuild\ntheir ultimate teams. They\nrefuse to let that cash cow\ndie, and so no matter how\nbad the press is, they have\nto fight Belgium, and they\nhave to win.\nHowever, it\u2019s not just\nabout the lootboxes. The\ngames industry operates\nunder a level of self\nregulation, and if governments started taking a\nlook at their flagrantly anti\nconsumer practices they\ncould be in serious trouble\nof losing these sources\nof recurrent income. In\nthe year since this PR\ncalamity, lootboxes have\nstarted to vanish (at least\nfrom triple A games),\nto be replaced with the\nfar more openly sleazy\nstandard micropayments.\nThe industry is hoping\nthat they can sidestep\nfurther scrutiny by essentially saying \u201cwe messed\nup, but we\u2019ve regulated\nourselves and the problem\nis solved, please go back\nto looking the other way\u201d.\nBut I for one hope they\ndon\u2019t get away with this,\nand that these companies\nare forced to scale back\ntheir dealings in micro\ntransactions. Once they\ncan\u2019t squeeze you for all\nyour worth they\u2019ll have to\ngo back to the old system\nof making a profit by\nmaking the best games.\nSo that\u2019s where we are\ntoday. Publishers continue\nto fight for their right to\nexploit you in new and\ninnovative ways. But EA\nscrewed the pooch, and\nwe may be at the start of\na long road that leads to a\nbetter games industry for\ncustomers.\nCould EA find themselves in court?//EA\nGAMES\nFELIX ISSUE 1705\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nSamuel Welton\nGames Writer\n\u201cThese kids\nare learning\nwhat it\u2019s like to\ngamble\u201d\n\u201c D i s n e y\nthreatened to\ntake the Star\nWars licence\naway from EA\u201d\n\n"

Additionally, the\nFar-Right activist alleges\nthat \u201ca lot\u201d of money left\nin the account has been\nfrozen for six months.\nEarlier this year, Twitter\ntook a similar approach\nwhen they removed his\n\u2018verification\u2019 tick, and\neventually revoked his\naccount\u2019s access to the site\npermanently.\nBeing private companies I concede that yes,\nthey do have the legal\nright to do so, as long as\nthey cite the relevant fine\nprint in their terms and\nconditions. But this sets a\ndangerous precedent. We\ncannot allow companies\nbarring customers due\nto their political views\nbecome the norm. What\u2019s\nnext, George \u2018Gideon\u2019\nOsborne being asked for\nID at a Wetherspoons\nbecause of his unfortunate stance on Brexit?\nWhat happens when your\nfavourite iconoclast is\nstripped of their money\nand platform?\nIf you aren\u2019t worried\nby companies choosing\nto define what is and isn\u2019t\nhate speech, then you\nshould be. Paypal now\nhave the precedent to\nremove any public figure\nthat falls on the wrong side\nof at least 66,000 people.\nI\u2019m sure you could find\nas many \u2018Men\u2019s Rights\nActivists\u2019 that have a\ngrudge against Germaine\nGreer. It\u2019s reasonable to\nbelieve that the banks\ncould follow suit, and it\u2019s\nnot so ridiculous to extend\nthat to the rail services and\nmajor airlines. Now Greer\nis stuck on a Ryanair\nflight and she can\u2019t even\nbuy a soggy egg and cress\nsandwich. Is that really\nthe future that liberals\nwant?\nOf course conglomerates have sovereignty\nover their decisions: they\ncan take any action that\nthey believe will increase\ntheir market value, including to discriminate at\nwill. Except for the fact\nthat they most definitely\ndo not. The law states that\na person merely has \u201cthe\nright not to express an\nopinion which one does\nnot hold.\u201d Paypal justified\nthis action by claiming\nthey do not allow their\nservices \u201cto be used to\npromote hate or violence.\u201d\nBut allowing Robinson\naccess to the platform does\nin no way constitute a declaration of support for his\npolitical views. It would\ntake an impressive leap\nof logic to conclude that\nPaypal founder Elon Musk\nvoted Leave just because\nRobinson was allowed to\nsend \u00a34.50 for his share\nof the Uber. Similarly,\nPaypal fails to make such\na song and dance over the\nclosure of accounts found\nto be processing drug-re-lated transactions.\nDiscrimination on the\ngrounds of age, gender\nreassignment, marriage\nstatus, pregnancy, disabil-ity, religion, sex, or sexual\norientation is illegal. Does\nit not infringe on the right\nto freedom of speech to\npotentially be made financially insecure as a result\nof your views not lining\nside of history. But are\nwe to expect Paypal to\nbe the sole arbiter of progressive views? Or just\nanyone who can retweet a\npetition to a large enough\naudience?\nNo matter what you\nthink of Yaxley-Lennon\u2019s\nviews, however abhorrent you may consider\nthem, no-platforming\nsuch radical views will\nnever be the way to\nchange public opinion.\nYou will never squash\ncontroversial opinions by\nno-platforming, ridicul-ing, or simply screaming\n\u201cfascist!\u201d repeatedly into\nthe abyss. Instead, they\nwill continue to breed\nand bubble up somewhere\noutside of your echo\nchamber. The next thing\nyou know, a populist with\nbeliefs that you refused to\nconsider and challenge as\n\u2018legitimate\u2019 has majority\nsupport.\nGrumpy Bastard on Imperial Ethics\nAfter some time alone, Grumpy Bastard returns to talk about Imperial ethics.\nT\nhis week I\u2019ve\nbeen unfortunate\nenough to be in\nthe middle of\nRemembrance Day. In\nbetween the white and red\npoppy virtue signalling\nas hard as they possibly\ncan. People are too busy\nCOMMENT\nGrumpy Bastard\nComment Writer\ntrying to work out which\nwars are the right ones\nto remember and which\nones should be ignored as\nimmoral foreign policy. I\nguess we\u2019ll just forget the\nveterans that now live as\namputees, are homeless\nor suffer from PTSD.\nThey\u2019re just the foot\nsoldiers of the military-in-dustrial complex\u2019s attempt\nto extract all the oil from\nIraqistahn anyway and not\nreally worth our consider-ation. Isn\u2019t it great when\nyou can sum up the causes\nof a complex geopolitical\nconflict in just four words?\nMoving on to the main\ntopic of discussion this\nweek, ethics at Imperial\nis almost a joke. The\nuniversity knows that the\nmajority of the student\nbody just don\u2019t care\nwhether the actions of\nthe university or those of\nthe companies providing\nsponsorship are moral or\nnot. Most of the people\nhere went through the\nrigorous selection process\nof having parents wealthy\nenough to send you to\nprivate school or middle\nclass enough to live in an\narea where you don\u2019t have\nto mingle with the riff-raff.\nThis economic insulation,\ncoupled with scientists\nthat sincerely believe\ntheir work happens in a\nvacuum means there is\na huge moral disconnect\nacross the university. The\nclosest most of you fucks\ncome to encountering a\nmoral dilemma is whether\nit\u2019s okay to shark a fresher\nor not. No one even\nraises a whimper about\nthe dodgy shit that goes\non around here all the\ntime, in the understanding\nthat \u201chey, at least it\u2019s a\nprestigious university and\nwill be good for my future\ncareer.\u201d\nThis leaves the unethical fucks with access to\ntop tier talent to recruit\nfrom. I sometimes wonder\nwhether Shell would be\nquite so good at bribing\nNigerian governments, or\nwhether BAE would be\nquite so good at blowing\nup Yemeni civilians, or\nwhether Amazon would\nbe so good at threatening\nstudent newspapers if they\ndidn\u2019t have access to this\ntalent. Who knows?At the\nend of the day, they all pay\nrather well, boosting the\nonly thing this university\ncollectively cares about:\ntheir graduate earning\nstatistics.\n\u201cShould we\nexpect Paypal\nto be the sole\narbiter of\nwhat is and\nwhat isn\u2019t\nprogressive?\u201d\nup with the majority?\nBy this I don\u2019t claim that\nRobinson is a sort of\nIslamophobic Rosa Parks;\nhe will almost certainly be\nfound to be on the wrong\n\u201cThe closest\nyou fucks\ncome to a\nmoral dilemma\nis whether it\u2019s\nokay to shark a\nfresher\u201d\n\n"
