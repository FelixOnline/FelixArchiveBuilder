    "content": "2 FELIX 13 November 1968\nBAXTER v. BUCHANAN\nOn Thursday 31st October we saw the first really successful debate at I.C. this year. To a packed concert hall\nRaymond Baxter proposed the motion that \"Motorists are\na Persecuted Class in Society.\"\nAt the start of his speech\nMr. Baxter stressed that he\nwas not, as stated in the\npublicity, motoring correspondent to the B.B.C., but\nmerely, \" a poor bastard\nwho just happens to own a motor car.\" Quoting many\nstatistics on motoring taxes,\nhe admitted they proved\nvery little but said that we\ncould not afford to spend a lot of money on road im-prove ment s. He heavily\ncriticised two lane motorways and ended with the\nproposition that if everyone\nignored parking restrictions\nthe authorities would be\npowerless.\nProfessor Buchanan, opposing the motion, after a quick recommendation on a teach-in on traffic problems,\nwent straight on to the fact\nthat the proposer had not\nreally spoken on the motion.\nHe had not, he said, proved\nthat motorists were persecuted and was unlikely to do\nso, persecution being too\nstrong a word. Describing\nthe country's traffic problems, he too wandered off\nthe subject but gave a good\ndescription of possible solutions to traffic congestion.\nThe two second speakers\nkept more strictly to the\nmotion. Robin Dibblee,\nfor the motion, mentioned\nhigh garage charges and\npersecution of the motorist\nby pedestrians. Mike Newton, opposing, said little\napart from motorists, drunk\nwith power, being useless\nmembers of society.\nSpeeches from the floor\nwere generally notable only\nin their lack of quality. One\ncan only hope that these will\nimprove as I.C. becomes\nmore debate-minded. A debate is one of the few places\nwhere one can legitimately\nspeak just to hear one's own\nvoice, a point proved admirably by C. Parker with some\nfine poetic banality.\nAfter the summing up\nspeeches by Professor Buchanan and Mr. Baxter,\nwho reiterated their earlier\nspeeches, the motion was\npassed by 156 votes to 117.\nURN GUY I.C. celebrated Mr. Fawke's( who?) nth anniversary\non November 4th this year. I am sure the original Guy\nwould have pressed on in the face of Rugby in Parliament\nSquare on the 6th. However the ground staff at Harlington wanted two days to remove the aftermath of revelry.\nAbout three hundred people were persuaded to go\ndown to Harlington (you know, our Sports Ground) by\ncoach. Despite the annual Ents committee rain dance to\nprevent the burning of their chairman, fine weather pre-vai led. A large fire topped by a suitable effigy (someone in\nICWA lost a pair of trousers!) started the frolic at 7.30, by\nwhich time the participants were fortified against the chill.\nEnts provided a \u00a350 firework display which lasted for\nhalf an hour and a \u00a315 group which dragged on for two\nand a half hours. An on-the-spot observer remarked that a firework display held at about 9 o 'clock would have provided a welcome break from the heat of the fertility rite on\nthe dance floor.\nSERJEANT MUSGRAVE S DANCE\nFor their first production\nof this session, the Dramatic\nSociety will give four performances of \" Serjeant\nMusgrave's Dance,\" by\nJohn Arden. The play, to\nbe performed in the first\nweek of December, is the\nstory of four soldiers who,\narriving in a snow-bound\ncolliery town under the guise\nof recruiting, want to spread\ntheir obsession with the futility and cruelty of war.\nAlthough the play is set\nin 1880 AD, it was written\nin 1960 to express the au-thor's opinions on this sub-j ect, which is very relevant\nnow in the light of developments in.S.E. Asia.\nDetails of the performances and advance bookings\nwill be published in the near\nfuture, and enquiries can\nbe made to I.C.D. S. Business Manager, c/o Union\nrack.\nTOUCHSTONE\n'Student Revolts'\n\"A lot of silly people\npaying 15s. to sit in a house\nin a park and be told what to\nthink by an expert\" \u2014 a definition by a participator.\nDr. Little, the expert in\nthis case, described himself\nas a\" good New Statesman\nliberal.\" A student at LSI7\nfrom 1953-56 he had demonstrated against Sharpeville and Hungary, but did\nnot sym pathis e with student\nrevolts directed against the\nUniversity itself. Student\ndemands for representation\non disciplinary committees\nand a say in the content\nof courses tended to make\nhis hackles rise, said Dr.\nLittle. Students were not,\naccording to him, full members of the University, and\ntherefore could not be\nequally represented with\nstaff. The University itself\nshould remain outside so-cie ty, preserving inviolate\nits functions of teaching and\nresearch. In this context he\ncondemned LSE students\nfor occupying the school.\nDiscussion groups agreed\nthat the student most likely\nto demonstrate would be an\nextrovert political scientist\nwith a left-wing back-ground, like a socially involved LSE student. In contrast the nearest the average\nIC student gets to rebellion\nis Morphy Day. What were\nthe reasons for student revolt ? Answers to this varied from \" capitalism \"' and\n\" technical bureaucracy \" to\n\" political naivet e on the\npart of students\" depending on the political colour of\nthe discussion group. The\nmajority, however, assumed\nthe need for a society in\nwhich the individual would\nbe more than a cog in a bureaucratic machine. The\nquestion was how to obtain\nit,\nA lyric interlude in Windsor Great Park left radical\nfer v our unabated. The\nformation of a new political\nparty which would lead the\nmasses to maximum participation was discussed. Two\nAmericans present said that\nin the U.S.A. the time had\ncome .to \" drop-out \" and\nlive, Hippie fashion, on the\nleavings of the intensely\nmaterialistic American so-cie ty. Dr. Little suggested\nthat participation was not\ncompatible for a technically\nadvanced society. In an-s wer, some declared themselves willing to live on\nbread and water (figurative-ly) in order to achieve a worthwhile society. At this\njuncture, the discussion disbanded for tea.\nTHE DISEASE\nTHAT IS LIFE\nDespite the counter attraction at Harlington, the\nWellsoc meeting on November 4th was greeted by a full\nhouse of over 200 people.\nThe meeting took the form of a symposium, chaired\nby Prof. A. J. Ayer, Wykeham Professor of Logic at\nOxford, who was ably supported by I.C.'s own Dr. Carlyle\nfrom Biochemistry, and Dr. G. Spencer from a London\nhospital.\nSpores\nDr. Carlyle opened the\ndiscussion and looked at the\nproblem of life from the\nmicrobiological angle. Without attempting to define life,\nexcept as \" the sum total of\nthose activities that resist\ndeath,\" he instead described\nvarious orders of life-forms,\nranging from the viruses and\nspores which seem to be a transitional stage between\nthe animate and the in ani mate, 'to the higher order\ncreatures possessing directed ness, sensitivity and con-s cio us ness. Disease\nThe subject was then taken up by Dr. Spencer. In\na light hearted manner, he\nlooked at life from the medical point of view, with special reference to the problems of transplantation and\nprolonging life when it is\nno more than prolonging\ndying. Life he described as\na disease with a mortality\nrate of 100 per cent, but his\nviews on death were more\nserious, and he produced\nfigures showing the relative\ntimes taken for the destruction of the brain, heart and\nliver cells after deprivation\nof oxygen commenced.\nThese showed that the heart\nlived up to 10 mins. after\nthe brain was ir repair ably damaged, and \" death \" had\ntaken place.\nFinally, Prof. Ayer took\nhis turn to say that life was\nwhat you called it, and no\nstrict definition as yet ex is ted. Only prejudice, he\nsaid, prevented us from accepting the possibility of\nconsciousness in machines,\nbecause we instinctively correlate mental states with\ncertain physical states, without having any fundamental\nbasis for doing so.\nImmortality\nTaking up Dr. Spencer's aspect on the subject of life,\nhe looked ahead to the time\nwhen brain transplantation\nmay be possible, and asked\nwhat would happen to personal identity, and whether\nimmortality could be achieved as a result.\nDuring question time. Dr.\nSpencer gave his views on\nthis, and said that once the\nproblem of non-regen erat iv it y of the central nervous\nsystem had been overcome,\nthere was no reason why the\nproblem could not be solved\nin the next 25 years.\nProfessor Ayer gave a small sigh of relief at this\nnews, and remarked they\nmay be just in time for him\nafter all!\nAfter vigorous questioning from speakers from the\nfloor, including one Adolf,\nwho proposed immortality\nby regenerating a person\nfrom implanting one of his\nchromosomes in a fertilised\nhuman ovum, the meeting\nmoved upstairs, where coffee\nwas available for the lucky\nfew.\nObituary\nIt is our sad but necessary duty to report the tragic\ndeath of our most revered\nand longstanding columnist,\nColcutt. Last Saturday,\nwhilst trying to observe the\nantics of certain council\nmembers at the Lord\nMayor's Show, he fell to his\ndoom from the uppermost\npoint of his very own\nQueen's Tower.\nMistaken for a bag of cement by an Irish labourer,\nhe was placed in a concrete\nmixer and now forms part\nof the uppermost window-ledge in the new Science\nMuseum Library. His name\nwill always be remembered\nfor his idiotic, hard hitting,\ndestructive criticism\nR.C.S.' s beloved mascot, Jezebel, takes Guilds' beloved\npresident, Dermott. and Guilds' beloved mascot.

    "content": "1-tLI X,i j November lt fb H5 HELP FOR\nUNMARRIED\nMOTHERS\nJanet's letter to the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her\nChild (NCUMC) was to\nbring her new advice on how\nto play \" cat and mouse \"\nwith the registrar and, after\nthe inevitable discovery, a trip to London, a flat, a grant from the Home Office\nand the start of an external\ndegree course.\n7,000 helped\nThis case was but one\nof the 7,000 which the\nN CUM C managed to cope\nwith last year. Unfortunately, this figure has a double significance. As well\nas marking an achievement\nit also underlines that there\nwere 60,065 other mothers\nof illegitimate children born\nin 1967 who derived no\nbenefit from the Council.\nExpansion\nThe N CUM C has expanded a great deal since it was\nfounded in 1918 by a group\nof far-sighted women (under\nthe chairmanship of Mrs.\nLettice Fisher). Now there\nis a permanent staff of two\nsocial workers and 20 clerks\nand secretaries who somehow manage to give personal\nattention to the 400 or so\nletters they receive every\nday. They have a hardworking and enthusiastic\nGeneral Secretary, Mrs.\nMargaret Brammel, who devotes days and often nights\nto the administration of this\ncomplex service. She also\ngives lectures and makes\npersonal appearances for\nfunds.\nThe rapid expansion of\nthe N CUM C has been accompanied by an equally\nrapid increase in the services\nit provides. Broadly speak-ing, these services can be\ndivided into two categories\nservices which apply to the\nindividual and work aimed\nat improving the lot of\n\" bastards \" in general.\nLegal Rights\nIn the first case, the\nN CUM C acts primarily as a means of putting expectant\nmothers in touch with their\nlocal social worker. If this\nproves impossible, as in the\ncase of Janet Chadwick, the\nwoman is brought to London and taken under the\nwing of the Association it-self, which then sees to her\nneeds as far as it possibly\ncan. In addition, advice is\ngiven on such things as the\nlegal rights of the mother\nand her child and ways of\nobtaining money in the form\nof grants from numerous\ntrust funds.\nLegal Reforms\nThe second function refers to the NCUMC's role\nas a pressure group, which\nattempts to bring about legislative reform. At the\nmoment, a bill is being\nsought to provide equality\nof inheritance rights for illegitimate children. The recent\nabolition of the Limits to\nMaintenance Order was in\npart due to the N CUM C. Tragically, the merit of\nthis organisation is not\nwidely enough realised for it\nto get the support it needs\nand surely deserves. To continue its work, the Council\nhad to dig deeper and\ndeeper into its resources\nwhich are now exhausted.\nAt this time of crisis, the\nstudents of IC have been\nsufficiently moved by its\nappeals to choose the\nN CUM C for their Carnival\nCharity. In so doing, we\nhave made ourselves responsible for its financial salva-tion. Let us hope that we\ndo not fail them.\nKEVIN MULLIGAN SORTING\nOUT\nHORNSEY\nA motley collection of students stood in the cold\noutside Tottenham Palace Cinema (N.16 or somewhere).\nSOLIDARITY, STUDENT SUPPORT FOR HORNSEY, said a poster. \" Never done a day's work,\" said a passing\nmiddle-aged woman.\nExpressing solidarity were miscellaneous students, including TWO from IC.

I wonder whether the two lads who\nended up in hospital\u2014one with ia 14-stitch leg wound\ncaused by cave-man-like antics of his fellow students\nand the other whose sight has been seriously impaired\nby broken glass would agree. Over the October 17th demonstration ICU Exec rightly took the line that violence,\neven in this cause, was to be condemned. Then what is the\nreasoning behind the laying-on of coaches to send people\nto engage in this primitive orgy on the banks of the\nThames.\nIn theory, Morphy Day sounds a fine chance for students\nto let off steam by pelting each other with rotten vegetables.\nBut those who've gone know how it always works out in\npractice\u2014damage to property, inconvenience to the public\nand injuries caused by still-solid turnips, apples and even\nstones and broken glass.\nIf IC Exec is too cowardly to condemn this anachronistic rioting perhaps they will refrain from giving it their\nofficial blessing and wasting Union funds to hire coaches to\nbeguile Freshers to Putney.\nForget about the mess of Morphy Day, let it rot among\nthe stinking garbage on the Thames towpath. Forget about\nfollowing your leader and playing childish games that are\ntoo rough for you\u2014think about following yourself.\nThe mass of mediocrity that is IC displays such an\nappalling lack of individuality that I am tempted at times\nto stand up and count the sheep. Are you all af raid of your\nown personalities and potential? Surely College is the\nplace to find and display and experiment with your free-dom. LOOK AT YOURSELF, your diminutive soul nestling in your pretentious shell which has been formed by\nsociety and you. Now, LOOK AT EVERYONE ELSE.\nAre you the same? Are you?\nHave you ever sat in the quad with an anemone in\nyour mouth crying, have you ever plucked an icicle from\nthe foot of an irate polar bear, have you ever talked about\n\"Thee\" with Conrad Akin i at his Cape Cod summer home,\nhave you ever sat in your mud-spattered white Jensen with\na beautiful blonde, listening to a Bach fugue on your radio\nand lighting your Gauloise with a match struck on your\nfaded Levis?\nBe a get-away man.

Since they were\nnever used, they must be\nsomewhere. Surely our excellent bobbies can find\nthem or have they willed\nthese things to exist no\nmore?\nFinally, it may interest\nyour readers to know that\nthe same sort of people who\nwantonly destroy Union\nproperty, object to demonstrations because \"they degenerate into anarchy.\" Let\nus. therefore, not run them\ndown too hard. In addition\nto loving the battle, they\nalso love law and order,\npeace and democracy.

They therefore\nsuggested to the Committee\nthat, at least initially, staff\nshould only be able to book\nthe courts during vacations.\nThe Committee, on which\nthe staff were represented,\naccepted this arrangement,\nalthough as with other rules\nfor the Sports Centre, it is\nsubject to review by the new\nSouth Kensington Sports\nCommittee in the light of\nexperience. Staff may play\nas guests during term-time\nand life members of the\nUnion as well as ordinary\nmembers are allowed to\nbook the courts.\nR.J. PINE,\nChairman A.C.C. Mandate\nThe statement SENNET\nPROTEST, signed I.C. Executive Committee, (makes\npropositions beyond the\nmandate of the Union general meeting which passed\nthe original motion of pro-test.\nIt is stated that: this week\n(Oct. 23)'s issue of Sennet\ncontains incitement to vio-len ce. This claim is groundless and probably libellous.\nThis is followed by an unbalanced attack on Sennet\nitself. We ask : Do the six\nmembers of IC Exec consider themselves more representative of \"a vast section\nof London University students \" than the editor of\nSennet, whose appointment\nis controlled by UL U? We hope that during the\ncoming year IC Exec will\narrange for publicity of the\ndecisions which they are\nmandated to take as widely\nas appears to be their personal opinion on the Sennet\nissue.\nWe note with interest the\nclosing paragraph of the\nstatement where they support the principle of review of Officers who act beyond their mandate.\nJOHN WILLIAMS,\nHOWARD ROSCOE,\nPIERS CORBY N, RAVI KUMAR, on behalf of ICP AG meeting held Friday Oct. 25.\n. Subtle (or Subtile?)\nSir.\nIn view of the casualties\nof this year's Morphy Day,\nand the number of people\nwho went because they felt\nthey had an obligation to\ngo, like the Constituent College officials, one asks oneself : what is the point of\nthe towpath battle? Good\nfun? But who enjoys such\nhooliganism? Release of\nvarious stresses imposed on\nus by academic life. But the\nUnion provides other such\nopportunities for this. So\nwhy should we go down to\nPutney every year, turn the\nplace into a horrible mess,\nand end up with a fellow\nstudent who could possibly\nend up losing an eye, and\nanother one with 14 stitches\nin his leg. I think, and am\nsure that the majority of the\npeople in this Union agree\nwith me, that in future we\ngo down there actually to\nwatch the races and not to\ntry and viciously molest\neach other to the extreme.\nYours etc.,\nGEORGE ASSIMAKIS\nFloor Rep IC Council.\nSir,\nAs the author of the\nbroadsheet complained\nabout by Andrew Stewart in\nyour last issue, I also deplore the level of literacy in\nthe College. Mr. Stewart will\nfind that the only way to improve his standard is to buy\nhimself a dictionary, to supplement his Fowler. However as he chose to rush into\nprint I should like to quote\nfrom the latest edition of the\nComplete Oxford English\nDictionary. The 5th meaning of Subtile, as opposed to\nSubtle, given there reads:\n\" involving careful disc rim i nation.\" The references the\ndictionary follows this by,\nshow that, in the context of\nthe sentences I used it in, it\nis a more correct word to\nuse than subtle.\nI would therefore advise\nMr. Stewart to take a little\nmore care before he gives\nfull rein to his natural in dig nation.\nYours faithfully,\nM. H.M. CARRINGTON BOOK REVIEWS\nTHE ANXIETY MAKERS\nby ALEX COMFORT 8/6\nReproduction, mast ur ba* tion, constipation and contraception are matters which\nconcern most of us at some\ntime in our lives. Dr. Alex\nComfort, in this amusing\nbook, gives a brief history\nof the medical and pseudo-medical attitudes to these\nand similar matters. He is\na mine of fascinating, if\nsometimes irrelevant,; information, e.g. prostitution was\na reserved occupation during World War II, but his\nmain theme is serious, that\nthere will always be a division between the liberals and\nthe traditionalists on matters\nof this kind. He illustrates\nhis point not only with historical examples but with\nmodern issues such as organ\ntransplants and the teaching\nof autistic children. Not only\nis this an enjoyable book\nto read : it also makes you\nthink.\nWHAT KIND OF\nREVOLUTION?\nA Christian-Communist dio-logue,\nedited by James Klugman\nand Paul Oestreicher, 6/-.\nChristianity and Marxism\nare the two ideologies which\nhave had most effect on\ncivilisation as it exists today.\nThese essays by British\nholders of both creeds reveal\nhow much common ground\nthere is while accepting the\nstill great differences. All the writers accept that the\nThe first four books in the new Panther Modern Society\nseries cover a broad field. Three are reviewed below and the\nfourth, 'La Vida' by Oscar Lewis will be covered later.\npopular images of both ideologies are false, mainly because of distortion in the\npractices of their advocates,\nand much emphasis is laid\non recognising basic be-lief s. The other aspect of\nthe dialogue is social doc-tr in e, for starting either\nfrom the idea of an ideal\nsociety or from the belief\nthat each individual is made\nin the image of God, a condemnation of war, poverty,\nand racial prejudice can be\nreached. Whether violence\nshould be used and how important the individual person is in attaining ideals are\npractical issues discussed at\nlength. As a Christian, I feel\nthat every Christian should\nfind in this book a stimulus\nto consider the social implications of his faith and, I believe, every Marxist may\nperhaps gain some idea of\nthe sanctity of the in divi dual.\nGOING HOME\nby DORIS LESSING\nIn a reprint of a10 year-old\nbook, the author, a Communist, describes a return to\nRhodesia at the time of the\nFederation. This interesting\nsituation leads to an ambivalence wholly good for her\nwriting. The book contains\nmany personal conversations\nwith all shades of white opi-ni on. It is also a celebration\nof the landscape and of early\neffort in building the party.\nDAVID PENFOLD\nDAVID LARBALESTIER\n\n"

Over 750 students\nreceived invitations from\nhim to the only staff-student\nservice of the year, the\nCommem Day Service in\nHoly Trinity Church. Attendance by students was\nsurprisingly good but attend-dance by staff was pitiful.\nIvor rails staff\nIn response to their invitations staff offered excuses.\nAbout two turned up to join\nLord and Lady Penney and\nLord and Lady Sherfield in\nthe front three rows. Ivor\ncalled this a scandal and\nsuggested the staff were\n\" paid for talking a lot and\ndoing nothing.\" He would\nwait and see whether staff\nturned up to meet the\nBishop of Kensington on the\n20th November and came to\nthe confirmation service in\nMech Eng foyer at 7.0 p.m. on November 19th, before\nhe passed judgement on\ntheir sincerity in the drive to\nimprove staff-student relations. Attendance apart, IC is\nnow very backward in the\nplanning of Commem Day\nservices. The speakers are\nchosen by the College authorities without consulting\nstudent religious leaders\nwho meet in the \" Holy\nHuddle.\" Consequently the\nauthorities prefer Bishops,\nwho deliver sermons of technical merit, but not as related to everyday life as the\noccasion demands. The system also tends to compromise student ecumenism. A reform in the present procedure would make a suitable topic for discussion in\nthe Joint Union Rectors Governors Committee ( JUR GO). Sennet\nPeople who have counted\nup the cost of the 50 glasses\nbroken in the Union Bar\nduring an infamous Freshers' Dinner might be\ntempted to guess that discipline was the main thought\noccupying the minds of ICU\nExec. Not a bit of it; they\nare pondering the extraordinary blunder forced on\nthem by a group of people\nwho issued a libellous\nstatement about \" Sennet \"\nin the name of IC Exec.\nLeaving aside the ethics\nof the group, who sent out\n5000 copies of their statement all over London, one\nimportant question is raised.\nIf John Shields, Helen\nRudge and Co. disapprove\nso strongly of the bias in\nSennef let them get off their\nbacksides and write for\nthe paper. Sennet, like\nFELIX, is dependent on\npeople foolhardy enough to\nrisk exam failure working\nfor it and both papers\nreadily accept offers of help.\nBut of course it is easier to\nknock people, even to waste\n\u00a37 13s. of Union money to\nchallenge the freedom of the\npress, than to do something\nconstructive oneself.\nHapless G.

Minton.\nMystery of the evening was\nthe men n written entirely\nin French.\nThe 12 ft. long Linstead\nHall bar is due to be installed in 3-4 weeks time in the\nLower Gallery. The holdup is caused by the custom-made Southside-style shut-ter s. The cost, nearly \u00a31,000,\nwill be paid for by a consortium of brewers, one of\nwhom is Courage.\nThe bar will be run by a residents rota of two students per night under a committee of 10 headed by Spike\nBantin, who hopes the profit\nwill exceed the \u00a3200 per\nyear made by Weeks Hall\nBar. Opening hours will\nbe from 7.15 to 11.00 p.m. The bar is intended for\nresidents and guests, but\nother I.C. Students will be\nallowed in.\nIn the last few days you should all have received a letter about a life insurance scheme. Since everyone seems\nto get insurance leaflets on an ever increasing rate, you may\nwonder why the Union is taking a hand in sending out yet\nanother offer. The reason is that this is a block policy,\nof the kind formed by many companies for their staff, and\nhence is cheaper than an individual policy. The insurance\ncompanies administration expenses are cut down by this\nscheme, both because of its size and because we undertake\npart of the work. The cost is about 60 per cent of a normal\npolicy.\nIt is intended for students with dependants, as it is\nsolely a life insurance scheme.\nThe constitutional reform committee has now started\nto meet. In the last few years, there have been several\nmajor and minor suggestions for changing the running of\nthe Union, some of which have been passed by Union\nmeetings. The idea of this committee is to save us from\nchanging things piecemeal, and to arrange for an informed\ndiscussion of all the possibilities open to us. If anyone is\nwondering what the issues are, I can cite examples; should\nelections for certain posts be by the Union or Council,\nshould we have an Executive or Council, and if so, who\nshould be on them, should we have a sabbatical year for the\nPresident, and what should our quorum be?\nIdeas, please\nThe committee will be asking for ideas and views from\nsections of the Union, such as the clubs committees and the\nConstituent Unions, but it is also important to get the views\nof as many individuals as possible. To get any constitutional\nchanges through two union meetings, with the necessary\ntwo-thirds majority, is a difficult task. But this can be\nmade much easier if we can gauge the feelings of the\nmajority beforehand. So if you have any ideas about how the\nUnion could be run, or if you just have an opinion about\nsome of the issues such as elections, can you please let us\nknow. You can write to the Constitutional Reform Committee, c/o the Union office, or tell any Floor Rep at a Communicate Session; or just come into the Union Office.\nDear Aunt Vera,\nCarnival Queen\nTheje is to be a Carnival\nQueen contest this year.\nThe duties of this post are\nnot very arduous\u2014very little\nmore than a \"resident pretty\nface.\" The first stage of the\ncontest will be run through\nFELIX.

The Morphy race provided the high spot of a cold\ndeary afternoon when all\nthree crews began the last\nstretch of the course with\nonly | l \u00a3 lengths separating\nthem. Up until the Black\nBuoy, Mines and Guilds had\nbeen contesting the lead,\nwith R.C.S. trailing by\nabout i length, but at this\nR.C.S. spurted and drew\nlevel. For the last minute\nGuilds clung to a marginal\nlead until the final 20\nstrokes of the race, when\nR.C.S. with a magnificent\nfinish managed to draw\nahead and win by a canvas.\nCoxing played al arse part\nin the winning of this race\nwith each crew at some\npoint striving for the fastest\nWater, and it is unfortunate\nthat there is no perfectly\neven course close at hand\nGOLFERS SOON TO\nBE HOMELESS?\nThe standard of Golf at\nI.C. on the competitive level\nhas been exceedingly b 'gh so\nfar this year. The College\nTeam has consisted of six\nsingle figure handicap men\nin both our matches so far.\nThe results in these matches\nwere very close but boi h came out in favour of I.C. In the first match against\nPortsmouth \" College of\nTechnology, which was\nplayed at Wankley Common\nGolf Club, the College won\nby 3^ matches to 2\\, and in\nthe second, played at Hendon Golf Club against the\nUniversity of Kent, the result was 4 matches to 2.\nThe rest of the College\nGolf Club have been paying\nregular visits to Hendon\nGolf Club to which we are\naffiliated. Unfortunately the\nCommittee at Hendon Golf\nClub has decided to terminate our agreement with\nthem on the 31st of December this year. That means\nthat the Golf Club is now\nhomeless.\nThis problem will be discussed at an Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting of the Club\nto be held at 1.00 p.m. Thursday 14th November\nin Committee Room A. Could all those interested in\nthe future of Golf at I.C. please try to come along to\nthis meeting.\nI. A. DICK\nBADMINTON\nDISASTER\nThe first team lost their\nfirst league match of the\nseason last Wednesday be\ning beaten 8\u20141 by West\nHam at Nine Elms Baths.\nThis brought to sudden end\nthe good run the first te^m had been enjoying, having\nbeaten Queen Mary College\n2nds8 \u20141 and Chelsea 9\u20140.\nThe other teams have little\nsuccess in the 2nd division\nand should perhaps draw inspiration from the Ladies\nMixed teams which are as\nyet undefeated.\nThe Ladies team has\nbeaten Chelsea 5\u20144, and the\nmixed team have beaten N. Polytechnic 6-3, and Queen\nMary College, (last year's mixed champions) also by\n6\u20143.\nHOCKEY\nNEWS\nWeather has badly hit this\nterm's programme to date.\nThe 1st XI has been lucky\nand played 3 games in the\nlast fortnight. They beat the\nRoyal Free Hospital 2\u20140;\nhowever, this was not a fair\nreflection on the College's superiority. The lack of\ngoals was due to two things:\na bad pitch and bad shoot-ing. Against St. Edmund's Hall, Oxford, the College\nwas again superior but failed\nto score and they this time\npaid the penalty. After\ntaking the lead through a short corner by M.G. Burt,,\nSt. Edmund's equalise d shortly before time.\nAgainst Epsom, the 1st XI was completely at sea.\nAdmittedly the pitch was\nextremely slippery after\nheavy rain, but Epsom\nshowed how the game\nshould be played under such\nconditions and they were\nunlucky in not being two\ngoals up in the first five\nminutes. Their persistence\nwas rewarded by goals-three in fact by half-time.\nAfter the turn-round the\nCollege came more into the\ngame and managed to score\nthrough Mudan, the final\nscore being 3\u20141.\nThe 2nd,3 rd and 4th XIs\nhave all done well to hold\ntheir opponents from Dulwich to draws. However,\nthe 3rd and 4th s were assisted by one or two members from the 1st XI, whose\ngame was cancelled.\nSTEVE HILL FLABBY DISPLAY\nFROM 1st XI\nI.C.\\ st XI 1. Kings \\st\nXI 1.\nIn conditions unsuitable\nfor good football IC entertained Kings, their old\nrivals from previous en-counters.\nIC opened strongly with\nconstant attacks, and within\nthe first few minutes should\nhave been one up. This pattern continued for most of\nthe first half, creating at\nleast four good chances,\nwhich should have given\nthem a good lead at half\ntime. However, due to very\nslack finishing IC did not\nmanage to score. After\nabout thirty minutes, Kings\nwere allowed to take the\nlead following a bad mix-up\nin the IC defence. IC continued to have most of the\nplay and Dave King was unlucky not to score with a fine shot which scraped the\npost.\nThe second half was\nrather disappointing. IC\nseemed to lack drive and\npunch for long periods, and\ndid not really look like re-covering. It was a great\nrelief when, towards the end\nof the game, Tony Richards\nlevelled the score with a lob\ninto the corner of the net.\nOn the whole it was a rather flabby display and a greater sense of urgency is\nneeded, especially inside the\nbox.\nThe third team continued\ntheir winning streak, with a2 \u20141 victory over Q.M.

BEAT\nBELGIANS\nAGAIN\nIC Ist XV 19 pts.\nBelgian National XV 3 pts.\nLast Sunday, Nov. 3rd, this most enjoyable game\nwas played in cold windy\nweather but on a remarkably\ngood pitch, thanks to\nArthur Loveday and his\nstaff.\nIC first played the Belgians last Easter on tour,\nwhen the score was 16 pts.\nto 3 pts. to IC, and so the\nBelgians were keen for re-veng e. IC played badly for most\nof the first half, into the\nwind, and only towards halftime did they look at all\nconvincing when, from an\northodox passing movement,\nJohn Kelly (IC's guest\nplayer) put Keith Heaton\naway for a try. Bob Pine\nfailed to convert.\n3 pts. to 0 was to be the\nhalf-time score with IC\nthreatening to play well.\nWith the wind behind\nthem IC were unaccountably\nslow starters in the second\nhalf, but gradually the tries\nbegan to come. With John\nBallard back after injury,\nthe midfield trio of Ballard,\nKelly and Pine caused considerable trouble and scored\nthree times between them.\nHowever, one particularly\nremembers the mercurial\nagility and incredible burst\nof speed shown by Barry\nSullivan when creating a beautiful opening to put\nBob Pine clear.\nThe final score of 19\u20143\nwas a good and just one for\nIC who had played for most,\nof the match without Andy\nVickerstaff who had a damaged eye.\nThe Belgians never gave\nup but their tackling, at\ntimes worse even than IC's sadly let them down;\nthey did however deserve\ntheir late try scored by JeanPierre Vachaudez.\nDESTITUTE CHILDRENS FUND Why not a Carol Party Tins, badges etc. available\nWAR on WANT\nLondon, W.5 Every penny goes\nChristmas cards sale\nor return 4d. each\nPublished by Paul Heath on behalf of ICU Publications Board and printed by West London Offset Co, 86 Lillie Road, S.W.6 "

    "content": "INCREDIBLES IN CONCERT\nFELIX 13 November 1968 7\nKEEF'S KORNER\nHave you ever been to\none of those concerts where\nyou enjoyed it? The in-song to end so that you\ncould show just how much\nyou enjoyed it? The incredible String Band's performance at the Albert Hall\n(Nov. 2nd) was definitely in\nthis category.\nTwo Scotsmen, Robin\nWilliamson and Mike Heron\nmake up \" The Band,\" and\nhave developed a unique\nmusical style in the present\nworld of lala la laing Tremeloes and Bicycletteing Englberts. All their songs are\nself-penned; Robin's, deep\nto the extent of being ob-s cure, the tunes heavy with\nthe mystery of the medieval\n\" lute and sackbut\" era\nand Mike's, much happier\nusually .based on West Indian rhythms. Assisted by\ntheir girl friends Liquorice\nand Rose (surely the cutest\nfemale around) they worked\ntheir way through a huge\npile of instruments on the\nstage ranging from a wh in ing, three-stringed violin\ncontraption down to a humble tea-chest\u2014the latter\nbeing used as a bass drum\n(in case you were per-plex ed!) Most of the numbers were from their new\ndouble album \" Wee Tam\nand the Big Huge\" and\nwere for most part in the\nstyle of their previous re-cords.\nHowever, after the interval came a break from the\nString Band tradition with a real root in' toot in' country\nand western number, fiddles\nand all.\nThe finale was a poem\n(unintelligible unfortunately)\nset to music. During its\nperformance, the company\nwas swelled by assorted\ndance-mime characters in\neluding Neptune and several\nnebulous nymphs. When\nthe show ended, the audi\nen ce clapped hands, stomped\nfeet . . . etc. for a full five\nminutes but to no avail. The\nonly result was to have two\nmore glimpses of the wie rd y dancers. Rather a let-down\nafter an original, ove iw hel ming, incredible con-cert.\nOBSCENE H TY Having been called ICs John Peel in my last article,\nI am hoping for a similar honour to his. He was voted\nmost popular DJ by Melody Maker readers; maybe FELIX readers will vote me most boring columnist of the year.\nColcutt's inane attack on disciplined performance of\nEnts in the last issue could\nhardly have been worse\ntimed, coming out a few\ndays after one of the best\nshows Ents (or anyone) has\nput on at IC since I have\nbeen here. The Pink Floyd\nmust surely be one of the\nbest groups in Britain at\npresent and they were on\ntop form with their superb\naudio and visual act at IC,\nwinning round an initially\ncool and sceptical audience.\nOnce or twice they lost cohesion but for most of the\ntime we heard a remarkably\nmusic which would just\nsound nothing but gimmickry played by almost\nanyone else, but which in\ntheir hands pushes back the\nfrontiers of contemporary\nmusic a little further.\nFor the rest of this term\nEnts have, for our delight,\nbooked the Idle Race for\nthis Saturday (16th), the\nAction for 30th November\nand Barclay James Harvest\nfor 7th December.\nHave you discovered\nKensington Market yet? It\nis situated on Kensington\nHigh Street, just before you\ncome to Barkers, about 10\nminutes' walk from the College. Here you will find\nstalls and boutiques selling\nclothes (for both sexes but\nmostly women's), antiques,\noriental goods, chemists\nsupplies, magazines, posters,\nrecords and lots of other as*\nsorted junk.\nNot only is the Market a good place for some surreptitious ogling but here are\nmany things worth buying,\ntoo. Some of the clothes are\ngood value, many trinkets\nare reasonably priced, there\nare two stalls selling brand\nnew LPs for about 30/-(against 36/'- to 39/- nor-m ally) and there is a stall\noffering a large variety of\npsychedelic posters (just\nthe job to brighten up your\ndull room) and probably the\nbest selection of Underground magazines outside\nthe Arts Lab.\nOne of these magazines\nwhich is especially worth\nmentioning is Time Out, a sort of psychedelic What's On, which gives details of\njazz, folk and pop concerts\nfilms, records, drama, off\nbeat shops, demonstrations\nand much more useful information. It is run by the\npeople who produced Unit\nKeele University's unofficial\nversion of Phoenix and pro\nb ably the best student maga\nzine in the country. Time\nC 'Jt costs 1/6 and comes out\nevery three weeks; the next\nissue is due out on 21st November. If anyone wants\nto publicise events to\nwider audience than just inside IC, Time Out is worth\ncontacting. The address is\n24. St George's Court\nGloucester Road, S.W.75847434. Insertion is free\nDAVE COOPER\nAt the beginning of this term it was my expressed\nintention to review only those films which were of particular interest to FELIX readers, or which might escape the\nreview columns of the national press. It was in deference\nto this principle that I sucked in cheap cigar smoke for\ntwo and a half hours amidst an audience, for the most part\ndrunk or frustrated\u2014or both\u2014and watched the CameoRoyal's late show on Saturday which just happened to be\na new Swedish film called \" I, a Woman \" ( XXXX XXX!). It's difficult to criticise this film from the point of\nview of artistry, or good direction, or even an enthralling\nplot. This does not mean that the film is either beyond\ncriticism or that it contains no art\u2014in its honest exposition\nof the body of its young (female) star, it features what can\nonly be described as a simply beautiful piece of art! But\nit is certainly not a director's film and has a pretty shallow\nStory.\nIf you are going to make a film about what the dictionary calls \" morbid sexual desire,\" then you must show\nits various manifestations as and how they happen. The\nclimate of sexual emancipation in Sweden is such that this\ncan be done without fear of censorship. The management\nof the Cameo Cinemas is such that they can get away with\nit. It's not pornography\u2014really, it's eroticism and honesty.\nIt's also great to watch (let's be honest, chaps) and it's fascinating if you're fascinated by sexual aberrations. It's completely artless however, and, if you are a domesticated,\nrighteous, stable, straightforward, contented, happy, house-trained hard-worker I should stick to your problem sheets\nand your Mrs. Whitehouse mailing list. Need I say more?\nIf nudity be a feature of \"I, a Woman\" it forms part of\nthe continuity of\" The Swimmer \" (A)( Columbia) in which\nBurt Lancaster's entire wardrobe consists Of a pair of\nswimming trunks.\nSWEDISH CINEMA or WHERE TO GO ON\nA SATURDAY NIGHT AFTER AN ABORTIVE I.C. HOP?\nNed Merrill (Burt Lancaster) is a man. One cannot\nfurther qualify this vacuous statement since one is not\nafforded the usual information of background\u2014he emerges\nfrom the woods\u2014or class\u2014everyone wears bathing trunks!\nSo we are immediately presented with a mystery which, it\nseems, will be resolved for us by the rest of the film. What\nis obvious from the start, however, is that this man is, at\nbest, an aesthete and, at worst, a misfit. With sun-tanned\nbody and well-groomed physique he stands apart from the\npaunchy hedonistic friends who are the inhabitants of the\nrich, pretentious American Urban suburb whose foundation is not a culture or even a cult but the a lumi no plastic\nbottom of unused but status-gaining swimming pools.\nO.K. so this is a sort of mature drop-out\u2014nothing to\nmake a film about, especially when his relationship with\nthose whom you would expect to despise him\u2014i.e. the\npool-patio dwellers\u2014is a very warm one. Ned then decides\nto swim home to his own house\u2014where, he repeats,\nLucinda (his wife) is fine and the girls (who adore him) are\nplaying tennis\u2014via the trail of swimming pools which mark\nthe route. The aghast stares and exhortations of his uncomprehending friends are all expected as is the admiration\nwe feel for this man in his love of nature and pursuit of\nphysical fulfilment. The trail home, however, is the theme\nof the film which portrays Ned's physical decline from amani fi cent climax where he paces a racing stallion in full\nflight. With his dep let ation of strength comes a degradation\nof character at the hands of successive pool-owners\nwho, from the grocer's wife who reminds him of his unpaid\nbills to the young starlet who taunts him with his supercilious duplicity in an old love-affair, ring upon him fragments of realisation which serve to quench the fire with\nwhich he started his heroic venture. The not-unexpected\nthough totally inconclusive ending falls not far short of\ntragedy in the best theatrical tradition.\nP.S. It must be said\u2014\" Barbarella \" is an awful film!\nJOHN SPENCE\nJohn Mullaly\nPHOENIX Last week, Felix Ace Reporter Bernard Foon visited Phoenix\neditor John Mullaly in his luxury London flat. Phoenix is\nI.C.'s own arts magazine; and witty, articulate Mullaly a former Felix staff man and regular contributor.\nSettling comfortably into\none of his massive arm-chairs, I asked John about\nhis general aims for Phoenix, as the magazine has\nbeen widely ignored in the\npast. He believes it should\nbe in complete contrast to\nEC's rigidly technological\natmosphere, while springing\nfrom it.\nPhoenix should play a larger part in I.C. life,\" he\nsaid, offering me one of his\nMended Balkan cigarettes.\n\" 1 want it to become something that everybody will\nwant to read, and contribute\nto.\"\nIn short, he is after that\nelusive thing\u2014involvement.\nPrevious editors have probably started off with much\nthe same ideas.\nMixing himself a double\nBacardi and Coke, John put\nforward his plans for the\nyear's first issue, which\ncomes out in January. Besides pieces on more general\ntopics this will include a revolutionary self-contained\nsection with a central theme.\nDid he have such a theme in\nmind?\n\" Time. Have you been\nwalking round with your\neyes shut?\" The centre\nsection will include any\navailable art form : prose,\npoetry, photographs, line\nart work, experimental lay-out, and the use of colour;\nand the theme can be interpreted as widely as possible.\nJohn is looking for contributions in any art form and\non any subject, but particularly on the theme of\n\" time.\"\nAs I left, John was pour-1\ning him sel t another Bacardi,\nready for a long evening at\nthe typewriter.\n\" If Phoenix looks good,\"\nhe called through the Portaphone, \" we hope to distribute it throughout London.\"\nToday London, tomorrow\n\u2014the world. With this\namazing man you never can\ntell.\nYou can contact John\nMullaly through the Plvoenix\nletter rack m the Union.\nPHOENIX PHOENIX requests and requires contributions; prose, poet\nry, photography, and artwork,\non the theme TIME. The theme is not exclusive. Contributions of any form, about\nanything you wish are equally\nwelcome.
