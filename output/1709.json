    "content": "ISSUE 1709\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10\nOf Missed Opportunities and Vanity: Books from the\nBalkans\nBOOKS\nPavan Inguva\nBooks Writer\nN\normally, I\nwould start\noff by sharing\nhow I seren-dipitously came across a\nbeautiful bookstore or an\nauthor, or book, related to\nthe country I am travelling\nto. This isn\u2019t one of those\noccasions. The two books\nI write about here came to\nme in a far more dubious\nmanner. The first book\nwas stuck in my Amazon\nshopping cart for months.\nI cannot for the life of me\nfigure out what course of\nevents led to its inclusion\nin my cart and eventual\npurchase. The second\nbook came to me as I was\nlooking for a quote by a\nCroatian author to use as\na caption for one of the\npictures I took whilst in\nCroatia (for the gram).\nRegardless of the less than\nideal circumstances in\nwhich I came to know of\nthese authors and books,\nthey are remarkably\nprofound reads, shedding\nlight on the Balkans, a\nregion with tremendously\ncomplex history and\ngeopolitics.\nThe Bridge on\nthe Drina by Ivo\nAndric\ndifferent ethno-religious,\nsocio-economic and\npersonal factors. We\noften think of places like\nSarajevo or Istanbul as\nbeing the central points\nwhere the winds of change\nblow the hardest during\nthe periods of the Ottoman\nand Austro-Hungarian\nempires. This is certainly\ntrue from a macroscopic,\nhistorical point of view,\nbut Andric takes a completely different approach,\nfocusing on how a smaller\ntownship and its racially\nand religiously diverse\npeople adapt and interact\nwith the changing times.\nI found this approach incredibly humanising and\nhistorically informative,\nwhich arguably is one of\nthe primary appeals of\nhistorical fiction.\nThe one thing I regret\nfrom this read was that I\ndid not take the time to\nvisit said bridge whilst in\nBosnia. As I was standing\nin the location where\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand was shot in Sarajevo,\nI was in awe of the fact\nthat I was standing in the\nsame location where one\nof the 20th century\u2019s most\ndefining moments took\nplace. I would imagine\nthat after having read\nAndric\u2019s work, having\nfelt the richness of human\nexperiences and history\non the bridge, the feeling\nof awe when I visit will be\nsimilar.\nThe Banquet\nin Blitva by\nMiroslav Krleza\nthis point, I felt bad that\nI was willing to use one\nof his quotes without\nhaving read his work. So\nto alleviate my guilt from\nliterary vanity, I ordered a\ncopy on amazon. Krleza\nis hands down one of the\nedgiest authors I\u2019ve ever\nread. This guy is more\nthan willing to call a spade\na spade in the crudest\nmanner good literature\npermits. The state of flux\nand political climate of\ncentral Europe in the 20th\ncentury has unfortunately\ngiven many a talented\nauthor keen insight into\npower and human nature\nand Krleza\u2019s work serves\nas an excellent example\nof this. Whilst this series\nis a trilogy, only the first\ntwo books are available in\nEnglish as a set.\nThe book is set in the\nfictional Balkan state of\nBlitva pre-WW2 with an\narguably stereotypical\ntroubled founding story\nfollowing the fall of the\nAustro-Hungarian empire.\nThe book focuses on\nColonel Kristian Baruntanski, the dictator who\nspearheaded Blitva\u2019s push\nfor independence, and Dr\nNiels Nielson, an intellectual and Baruntanski\u2019s\nchildhood friend calling\nfor his death as a traitor\nto Blitva. Dr Nielson\npublished an open letter\ncalling for the Colonel\u2019s\nhead. This sparks an escalating conflict between\nthe two, culminating in a\ncliffhanger ending in the\nsecond book with Nielson\nfleeing to neighboring\nBlatvia. This conflict\nserved as a thinly veiled\nsatire on how nationalism\nhas panned out in the\nregion, both ideologically\nand practically. Several\nancillary characters\nsuch as Major Georgis,\nBaruntanski\u2019s hitman,\nwere also well developed,\nhelping to characterise the\ninherent contradictions\nin human nature and the\ndivergent interest various\nstakeholders may have in\nrelation to political structures and action. Overall,\nKrleza has put together\na complex and edgy\nread. Power through and\nyou are rewarded with a\nremarkable insight into\nvariety of topics.\nBooks writer, Pavan Inguva, explores two books that shed light on the Balkans\nNobel Prize for Literature winner, Ivo Andric, in front of the bridge on the Drina // Serbia.com\n\u201cThese authors\nand books...\nare remarkably\nprofound\nreads,\nshedding\nlight on the\nBalkans\u201d\nAndric, born in Bosnia,\nreceived the Nobel prize\nfor literature in 1961 and\nthis is his best-known\nwork. The focal point\nof the book is the titular\nbridge spanning the river\nDrina in Visegrad, Bosnia.\nAndric chronicles the life\nand times of the people\nof the town as it occurs\naround this bridge over\nseveral hundred years\nfrom before the bridge\nwas built in 1577 up-to\nthe start of World War\n1 in 1914. Due to its\nremarkable construction,\nthe Mehmed Pasa bridge\nserves as an excellent\nsymbol for permanence\nand is an UNESCO\nworld heritage site today.\nAndric skillfully portrays\nthe human experience by\nintroducing and developing multiple characters\nduring each time-period,\nproviding continuity\nwhere appropriate. The\nensemble of diverse characters outlines both the\ncommonalities of experiences we share, and also\nthe variety of responses\nwe may have to changing\ntimes as a function of\n\u201cIn a drop of wine,\nthe universe sparkles.\u201d\nAn excellent quote\nfrom Miroslav Krleza\nthat makes an excellent\nInstagram caption.

For\nthose of you\nthat have the\nmisfortune of actually\nreading this, I hope you've\nmissed me as much as I've\nmissed you. You won't believe what time I'm writing\nthis editorial. It's not even\n10pm. New year, new me,\nfor real! One of my New\nYear's Resolutions was to\nbecome more organised\nand not be so stressed\nout on a Thursday night\nand I'm succeeding so far.\nLet's see how long this\nlasts...\nI'm not usually one to\nwrite New Year's Resolutions but I was in a\nreflective mood on New\nYear's Eve. Looking back\nat my 2018, I'm pretty\nsure I flopped all the resolutions I had at the start\nof the year. 2019 will be\ndifferent.\nDuring the Christmas break, I watched a\nYouTube tutorial titled,\n\"How to write an editori-al\". As you can probably\ntell, the video was useless.\nIt started with a warning\nabout the importance of\na good editorial in establishing early credibility\nas an editor of a publica-tion. Too late for that at\nthis stage! Anyway, the\n'proper way' of writing an\neditorial is dull and I much\nprefer rambling until I hit\na page. This editorial has\nalmost become a personal\ndiary for me, where I can\nreflect on my week and get\nthe inner workings of my\nmind down on paper. In\nfact, due to the fact I can't\ncount, we almost went\nwithout an editorial this\nweek (I'm not sure if there\nare rules against this). To\nbe perfectly honest, I'm\nnot sure what the rules\nare. They seem to just\nleave me in the basement\nand let me get on with it.\nThis week's issue sees\nDeputy Editor, Joanna,\ntake control of the News\nsection while I continue\nmy assauly on the Music\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!

The News article\nhighlighting the potential\nimpending crisis in Higher\nEducation is a must-read!\nMy Music article is decent\ntoo if you happen to flick\nto page 8.\nAs usual, the Arts\nsection continues to go\nfrom strength to strength.\nThis week, there's five\npages of #content. I'm\nstruggling to choose my\nsection of the week. (I'm\nalso struggling to fill the\nspace in this editorial,\nbut that's another issue).\nI'm in two minds. On the\none hand, the Arts section\nhas the most pages and\nthe Arts Editors' wholesomeness warms my heart\nevery Wednesday. On\nthe other hand, I wrote a\nMusic article so obviously\nI' that way inclined. In\nthe interest of fairness,\nI'm going to go against\nmy bias and give Section\nof the week to the News\nsection. Joanna's hard-hit-ting journalism takes the\nW this week. Congrats!\nThis editorial has\nbeen a real struggle. If,\nfor some reason, you're\nstill reading, please don't\nlet this deter you from\ncontinuing to read the\npaper. I promise we have\nan excellent issue for you\nthis week.

With\nGame of Thrones star Kit\nHarington and actor-mu-sician Johnny Flynn\nportraying Austin and Lee\nrespectively, we see the\nportrait of two brothers,\nwhich could be said to be\nmore of a bifurcation of\nthe playwright himself,\nand their own warped\nversions of the fading\nAmerican dream.\nHarington plays against\ntype as Austin, an IvyLeague educated screen-writer, who is housesitting\nfor his mother in her\nSouthern Californian\nhome. The arrival of Lee,\nplayed with menacing\nprowess by Flynn, after\nfive years of absence\nand three months in the\nMojave desert, disrupts\nthe neurotic Lee and old\narguments resume.\nThe first act belongs\nto Flynn, whose looming\nheight, harsh drawl and\ndeliberate movements\nbring an ominous air to\nthe estranged Lee. His\ncasual monologue on\nhow most murders occur\nwithin the family reveals\na feral underbelly, where\nhis time spent in the desert\nhas changed him for the\nworst. Lee then steals the\nlimelight from Austin and\nplays to producer Saul\u2019s\ngullibility, with a \u201ctrue\nWestern story\u201d.\nmantle of the petty thief.\nThis act belongs to Harington, with an outrageous\nnumber of toasters lining\nthe stage in his attempt to\nprove his skill, resulting in\na petering tower of toast\nand a furious Lee. Harington\u2019s comedic timing\nwas a delightful surprise,\nwith his degeneration\nT\nhere has not\nbeen a more\nappropriate time\nto perform The\nTragedy of King Richard\nthe Second. When else in\nmodern British political\nhistory have questions of\nleadership, the right to\nrule and the role of governance been drawn more\ninto question than now?\nWhen the excellent\nSimon Russell Beale,\ntransfigured into Richard\nin the tight atmosphere of\nthe Almeida, pronounces\nthose famed syllables\n\u201cNot all the water in\nthe rough rude sea Can\nwash the balm off from\nan anointed king\u201d, how\ncan one not think of the\ntunnel-visioned Brexiteers and their refusal to\ncontemplate a people\u2019s\nvote? How can one not\nthink of the arrogant\nincompetence of the\nTory party at this time of\nnational turmoil (after all\nwhat is \u2018the natural party\nof government\u2019 other than\na reformulation of the\ndivine right of kings)?\nYet, what we are presented\nunder the direction of Joe\nHill-Gibbins is a defensive formation that does\nnot give itself the room\nto explore such themes.\nThink Shakespeare in the\nform of a polite appearance at a Christmas party:\nwe go briefly, act charm-ingly, and leave as soon as\nis socially acceptable.\nHill-Gibbins\u2019 production is to modern\nShakespeare performance\nwhat minimal is to\ntechno, stripped back. The\nwashed, concrete stage\nand strip lighting is only\na smoke machine away\nfrom being a tucked away\nroom at Berlin\u2019s Tresor\nnight club. It is a small\neight person ensemble\nthat don the stage for the\nbrief 140 minute straight\nthrough run time.\nsimplicity is that each\nword and tone of voice is\ngiven the complete stage:\nwhen the spotlight is on\nBeale as Richard, it is\nreally on Beale as Richard.\nThis leads to certain devastating moments where\nthe words of the Bard ring\ntrue and have you aching\nto ask that they pause,\nrewind and repeat the line\nover and over. Beyond\nthe line delivery, even the\nminimal stage props make\ntheir impact, watching\nBeale drowned and\nhumiliated in earth and\nwater under a neon gaze\nis hard to top in terms of\ndramatic experience.\nOf course, the counter\nto the above is that the\nroom feels very empty\nwhen the space for exploration is not taken up.\nThe case in point being\nLeo Bill as Bolingbroke\nwho sometimes feels as\nfar away as his fictional\ncounterpart in exile. And\nit is here that one leaves\nthe theatre wishing more\nhad been said on the\nthemes that are begging to\nbe spoken about. Without\nthis, the cast are given\na heavy burden which,\nadmittedly, they do make\nan impressive attempt of\nbearing.\nWell done Jon Snow, well done // Marc Brenner\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 11TH\nJANUARY, 2019 FELIX\n11\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nMarena Gray\nArts Editor\nWhere?

The arrival of the\nMother at the point where\nAustin attempts to strangle\nLee with a whipcord adds\nthe element of the absurd.\nWith an accent significantly weaker than Harington\nor Flynn, Madeline Potter\ntalks down to the boys as\nif they were still unruly\nchildren, rather than men\non the verge of insanity.\nFrom my understanding of the playwright, his\nplays do not always make\nsense, focusing on mood\nand emotion, rather than\nstructured storytelling.\nThe play itself feels like\na collection of offbeat\nscenes, harshly cut with\ndrumming rhythms that\nshock you out of the story.\nHowever, there are some\noutrageous moments\nbetween the two leads\nwhich engage you to the\nbitter end.\n\u201coutrageous\nmoments\u201d\nIn an identity swap, not\nunlike a new suit which\nfits surprisingly well, the\nsecond act sees Lee try\nhis hand as screenwriting,\nwhilst Austin takes up the\nA brief, professional performance that plays it safe.\nARTS\nCalvin Nesbitt\nArts Writer\nWhere?

We\u2019ve\nrecently paid for an independent consultant to\nconsider areas of change\nto make the College green\nthis year. I The consultant\nrecommended some great\nareas for change, which I\npropose to you here:\n1) We\u2019re reconsidering an overhaul of the\npersonal tutorial system.\nWhy waste tutors so?\nAcademics are a finite\nresource; think of the\nchildren! That cannot\npossibly be good for the\nenvironment. How about\n30 people per tutor group?\nSavings! (for the planet)\n2) The new air-con-ditioning in the library\nseems to be doing you all\na lot of good. In the interests of global warming\n(and to save on heating)\nwe\u2019re leaving it on 24/7\nthis year.\n3) Oil spills are such\na waste of money. They\u2019re\nalso not that great for the\nenvironment. Both of\nthese go against our core\nvalues \u2013 so why waste\nperfectly good oil when\nwe could just recycle it for\nuse in Fusion? Crude oil is\nfull of naturally occurring\nhydrocarbons, you know\n\u2013 it\u2019s practically vegan!\n4) Speaking of oil,\nour good friends over\nat Shell have pledged\nto donate a sizeable\namount of funds towards\nthe administration to\n\u2018help improve services\u2019.\nEverything we do is for\nyou!\n5) It\u2019s nice we\u2019re\nsigning up for the Race\nEquality Charter, but\nit\u2019s pretty costly. For the\nenvironment, that is \u2013 all\nthat paperwork cannot\npossibly be good for\nthose indigenous people\nin Patagonia. Surely it\nwould make more sense\njust to scrap the whole\nthing? (We do take racism\nseriously though; we have\nblack professors)\n6) We\u2019ve decided\nthere are too many of you\nhome undergrads paying\nthese cheap fees. Hence\nwe\u2019ve decided to cull\nthe entire Earth Science\ndepartment. We all have\nto sacrifice for the greater\ngood.\n7) Oh, we\u2019re raising\nyour fees again. Green\nImperial!\nAlways eager to hear\nyour thoughts about this\n(though we will be putting\nthese through); my office\nis on the top floor (a.k.a\nnot-on-your level) of the\nFaculty Building.\nThe Hangmans practically write themselves // Memeperial\n7 ways Imperial will stay firmly in the green in 2019\nYou attend an ethics\nevent organised by\nShell.

The\nreport was very clear in\nstating that \u201cthe quality\nof the student-supervisor\nrelationship is central to\nthe student experience\nand hence, often central to\ntheir well-being.\u201d\nThe report further\nstates:\n\u201cThere was consensus\nacross staff interviews\nand student focus groups\nthat difficulty in the supervisory relationship was\none of the most common\nreasons for well-being\nissues, often exacerbated\nby imposter syndrome\n[a psychological pattern\nin which an individual\ndoubts their accomplishments and has a persistent\ninternalized fear of being\nexposed as a \u2018fraud\u2019].\nProfessional support\nservices staff particularly\ncommented that it was\none of the most difficult\ncircumstances to deal\nwith, not least as PGRs\nwere usually reluctant to\ngive them permission to\napproach the supervisor.\nAcademic and support\nstaff felt that there was\ngeneral reluctance within\nuniversities to tackle difficult supervisory issues\u201d.\nThe report mentions that\nstudents experience fear\nof complaining, perceiving themselves as being in\na powerless position. Only\n42% of students agreed\nthat they would feel comfortable in talking to their\nsupervisor about mental\nhealth issues, while 45%\ndisagreed; women being\neven less likely to talk to\ntheir tutors than men.\nWith \u201csupervision\nstories\u201d we are creating\na channel for us and the\nCollege to hear what is\ngoing on inside of labs\nand offices, without fear,\nwithout filter. It is also a\nway to inspire students\nwith problems to reach\nout for help through the\nconstantly improving\nImperial College welfare\nsystem and, eventually,\nresolve their problems\nand receive the PhD\nexperience they deserve.\nSo, dear students, please\nshare your stories!\nA new PhD community? Yes, please.\nD\nespite having\nbeenatImperial\nfor three years,\nadjusting to\nPhD life brought its own\nnew challenges, both\nacademic and in terms\nof maintaining work-life\nbalance, managing my\nmotivation and mental\nhealth and finding time to\ndevote to exercise. At the\nstart, when I knew literally no one, I wished I had\na way of finding support\nand friends in the wider\nPhD community. I wanted\nto meet people who have\nbeen at this point before\nand have had to adjust\ntheir approach to become\neffective in their research.\nUnfortunately, the lack of\ncommunity spirit not just\nin the PhD circle but at\nImperial as a whole means\nthat its research students,\nwho are responsible for a\nsignificant portion of the\nacademic output of the\ncollege, are suffering in\nsilence. Struggling with\nmotivation, mental health\nand resilience are no new\nproblems to PhD students;\na \u2018part of the job\u2019 some\nmight argue. But your\nGraduate Students\u2019 Union\n(GSU) is here to support\nyou to have the most enjoyable and effective time\nat Imperial. We want to\nbuild a community of PhD\nstudents which is collaborative and supportive in all\naspects of PhD life. I was\nkeen to get involved and\nhelp build this community\nbut, at the moment, it\u2019s a\nbit of an uphill battle.\nBefore the Christmas\nbreak, about five of\nyour elected PhD repre-sentatives. a sadly low\nnumber (although we did\nget extra pizza, mince\npies and mulled wine),\nmet to discuss some of\nthe big problems facing\nPhD students. Apart\nfrom spending almost\n20 minutes complaining\nabout how we are all\nslowly freezing to ice\ncubes in our labs and\noffices \u2013 which the GSU\npresident has agreed\nto raise further \u2013 overwhelmingly it was agreed\nthat building a college\ncommunity where PhD\nstudents between faculties can meet, interact,\nmake friends or even\nmore (speed dating was\neven suggested) would\nmake for a more positive\natmosphere! The GSU\nare working hard to\npromote cross-faculty\ninteraction, so watch out\nfor information about\n\u2018GSU Connect\u2019 and \u2018GSU\nBlack Tie Event\u2019 all to\ncome in the new year. For\nthose of you in the Faculty\nof Natural Sciences and\nlooking for a New Year\u2019s\nresolution which will\nimprove your mental and\nphysical health, consider\njoining me and the faculty\nrunning club: we meet\noutside SAF at 5:30pm\nevery Tuesday (and ultimately end up in H-Bar).\nYour GSU is here for you\nso, if there are any suggestions you have, talk to\nyour PhD representative\nor Academic and Welfare\nOfficers for your faculties.\nMultiple faculties are\nstruggling with open\ndiscussions about both\npositive and poor supervision of PhD students.\nThe GSU is looking to\nhear from its students\nso we can share good\nsupervision practice with\nthe Graduate School and\nCollege. One problem we\ndiscussed was the feeling\nin multiple departments\nthat PhD students are\nunderprepared for supervision of undergraduate or\nMasters project students;\nwe suggested that college\nshould make it mandatory\nfor supervisors to inform\nPhD students well in\nadvance when they have\nto supervise a project\nstudent. Also, we figured\nthat it would be good to\nhave access to additional\ntraining for PhD students\nby the Graduate School\nwho have to supervise.\nAs we look into the new\nyear it is also a good time\nto remind all members of\nour community about the\nmental health support on\noffer; Imperial College\nCounselling Service,\nUnion Advice Centre\nand Imperial College\nHealth Centre are all\noffering services open\nto all students. Every\ndepartment has qualified\nMental Health First\nAiders which can be\nidentified by their green\nlanyards. The Chaplaincy\nalso offers courses in\nmindfulness and tea, cake\nand chat, exclusively for\nPhD students, happening\nonce a month from 12.30-14.00 (the next one is 24th\nJanuary).\nWe hope to see you\nat some of our events\nthis term and encourage\neveryone to get involved\nin the Imperial Community!\nPOSTGRADUATE\nUte Thiermann\nGraduate Students\u2019Union\nPresident\nPOSTGRADUATE\nEmma Couves\nFoNS Academic and Welfare\nOfficer\nISSUE 1709\nFELIX\nPOSTGRADUATE gsu.president@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cYour GSU\nis here to\nsupport you to\nhave the most\nenjoyable and\neffective time\nat Imperial\u201d\n\u201cThe reaction\nfrom students\nand staff at the\nCollege was\npolarised\u201d\nI want to express\nmy recognition of the\nImperial staff working\nhard to improve student\nwell-being and who are\nrolling up their sleeves\nto tackle the PG related\n\n"

During the United\nNations Peace Summit\nof Emerging Leaders\n2018, which took place in\nBangkok from November\n28-30th, I was able to hear\nthe innumerable accounts\nof incredible struggle and\nbravery from both the\nspeakers and delegates.\nI have been avidly\ninvolved in social justice\naction and health-peace\nadvocacy whilst being a\npart of, and now President of, the organisation\nStudents for Global\nHealth. When Imperial\nBusiness School publicised this opportunity\nto represent Imperial at\nthe summit, I knew it\nwould be an enriching\nexperience culturally,\nsocially, academically and\npersonally.\nThe summit made clear\nto me that the greatest\nchallenges we face, in our\nincreasingly complex and\nuncertain world, all stem\nfrom the unabated aspiration for peace. Issues that\nchallenge peace should\nbe a concern for all \u2013 particularly in our globalised\nworld of unprecedented\ncommunication, intercon-nectedness and migration.\nThe threats to peace also\ncome from the inequality,\ndisenfranchisement and\nmarginalisation suffered\nby vulnerable groups,\nas well as the rejection\nand ignorance of other\ncultures, together with\ntheir traditions and beliefs.\nIt is imperative to\nunderstand that although\npeace is the absence of\ndirect violence (negative\npeace), it is also, more\nimportantly, the process\nby which the roots of\nconflict are addressed and\nnon-violent means for\nresolving conflict are discovered (positive peace).\nPositive peace has a transformative and restorative\ngoal, it uses the notions of\nsocial cosmology, culture\nand ecology to promote\na more sustainable future\nfor the world.\nPositive peace takes\nlonger to achieve as\nit recognises the time\nneeded for further analyse\nof ingrained structural and\ncultural matters. Cultural\nunderstanding emerges as\na vital factor in achieving\nlasting positive peace,\nand hence is a vital\nfoundation for achieving\nequitable progress and\nsocial cohesion in regards\npeace through art,\ncross-cultural dialogue,\nworkshops and exhibitions to create a shared\nvision for peace. Expressing oneself through art\nand creation has proven\nto be an essential tool in\nconflict reconciliation, as\nart is rooted in culture and\nencourages the deepest\nlevel of human experi-ence.\nNot only is art and\ncultural awareness understood as a restorative\nmeans for healing the\nscars of war but can be\nbeneficial for any mar-ginalised communities\nor individuals wanting\nto reconnect with their\nidentities. The success of\nPeace Masks, and cultural\ngroups alike, is a beautiful\nreminder that the fate\nof humanity depends on\nfostering appreciation\nfor diversity and paving\nthe way for meaningful\nmutual prosperity.\nUltimately, we all\nshould endeavour to\nacquire true knowledge\nfor our overall betterment\nand for universal welfare,\nwith a particular focus on\nissues that threaten peace\nin today\u2019s global commu-nity.\nAt the Lectern // Fatima Ali\n\u201cSpecial\nthanks to\nImperial\nCollege\nBusiness\nSchool for\nproviding\nme with this\nopportunity\u201d\nto refugees and migrants.\nDuring the summit, Kya\nKim, the director of the\nPeace Mask Project,\nspoke about the successes\npossible in achieving\nBelieving in students as agents of change // Fatima Ali Beautiful Bangkok // Fatima Ali\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1709\nFELIX\n12\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCaroline or Change Review\nC\na r o l i n e\nThibodeaux is\nonly 39, but her\nlife is already\nreduced to the basement\nof the Gellman household\nin which she is a maid,\nwhere the washing ma-chine, dryer and old radio\nare her only companions.\nWell, apart from eight-year-old Noah Gellman\nthat is. Noah idolises\nCaroline, taking every\nopportunity to spend\ntime with her, even when\nshe treats him with cool\nindifference or chastises\nhim for leaving his\npocket money in his dirty\nlaundry. When Noah\u2019s\nstepmother Rose insists\nCaroline start keeping\nany change she finds, to\nteach Noah a lesson about\nmoney, it brings into sharp\nfocus Caroline\u2019s situation\nand highlights her moral\ndilemma: forced to start\nconsidering keeping a\nchild\u2019s lost pocket money\nto help make ends meet\nfor herself and her four\nchildren.\nPlaywright Tony\nKushner is best known\nfor his widely acclaimed\nAngels in America,\nnotable for its highly\nintimate personal stories\nset against the backdrop\nof world changing events.\nCaroline or Change also\ncarries this particular\nKushner trademark: its\n1963 and John F Kennedy\nhas just been assassinated,\nthe American Civil Rights\nmovement is growing: it\u2019s\nclearly a period of great\nchange for America as\na whole. And so it is for\nCaroline: she\u2019s come to\nthis point, 39 and with\nlife looking bleak, when\nchange is in order. The\ncombination of small\nintimate individual stories\nand world changing political events just draws\neach into sharper focus,\nCaroline\u2019s personal\ndilemmas reflect the\nfrustration and thirst for\nchange of a nation, whilst\nthe sweeping changes\nacross the country are\njuxtaposed with how\nslow progress can be for\npeople on the ground like\nCaroline, whilst keeping\nup the hope that change is\nvery much in the air.\nJeanine Tesori\u2019s music\nis the perfect partner to\nKushner\u2019s words, transforming what might seem\nlike bleak subject matter\ninto something fun and\nheart-warming. It pairs\nparticularly well with one\nof the most original and\nfun aspects of the show:\nthe personification of\nchoice inanimate objects,\nsuch as the washing\nmachine and dryer that\nare Caroline\u2019s constant\ncompanions as in the\nbasement. Fly Davis\u2019s\nfantastic costumes help\nbring them to life, especially the 60s- inspired\nwashing machine (Mesha\nBryon) in her extravagant costume of plastic\nbubbles.\nSharon D Clarke, our\ntitular Caroline, is undoubtedly the star of the\nshow. Her commanding\nstage presence makes it\ndifficult to look away.\nAnd indeed its difficult\nto want to; she\u2019s amazing\nas Caroline, effortlessly\ncapturing her despair, but\nalso her quiet dignity. This\nisn\u2019t to say that the rest of\nthe cast are weak. Quite\nthe opposite: there isn\u2019t\na single weak link in this\nproduction, with the entire\nensemble cast delivering\nexcellent performances.\nSo many things come\ntogether to make Caroline\nor Change the visual\ntreat that it is. A fantastic\nmusical brought to life by\na near perfect production,\nthis is one of the definite\n\u2018must see\u2019 shows of this\nwinter.\nSwan Lake \u2013 A Lively Traditional Performance\nS\nwan Lake is\nperhaps the most\nrenowned classical\nballet repertoire\nstill routinely performed.\nRecent productions such\nas Matthew Bourne\u2019s\nreimagined all male\nproduction or even the\ntwisted representation\non screen in Black Swan\nhave only increased its\npopularity.\nThe English National\nBallet have kept tradition\nand modern ballet alive\nwith Derek Deane\u2019s\nproduction of Swan Lake.\nOriginally performed\nin-the-round at the Royal\nAlbert Hall in 1997 and\nthen restaged for conventional theatres, it has\nproven a hit for the ENB\nover the years.\nThis ninth production is\nperformed in the glorious\nLondon Coliseum.\nEnglish ballet, whilst\nperhaps not quite as ul-tra-refined as its Russian\ncounterpart, when done\nwell is a wonderful spec-tacle. This performance\nhad it all; lavish costume,\nimpressive scenery, strong\nperformances from the\ncorps de ballet and barely\na wobble onstage.\nIt was refreshing to\nsee traditional ballet done\nwell, with a few twists\nhere and there. In this pro-duction, Tchaikovsky\u2019s\nwonderfully written score\nwas beautifully conducted\nby Gavin Sutherland.\nA standout of the night\nwas \u201cThe dance of the\nlittle swans\u201d (cygnets);\nthe well-loved and incredibly difficult pas-de-qua-tre. The four ballerinas\nwere completely in sync\nfor the whole section; a\nrarity, with fantastic technique which gained large\nwell-deserved applause.\nOverall the company\nperformed well; the swans\nsection in Act II always\na delight with a good\ncorps de ballet. A standout\nperformer of the ensemble\nwas Precious Adams,\nnot forgetting Daniel\nMcCormick\u2019s impressive\nleaps and Julia Conway\u2019s\nimpressive pointe work of\nthe pas de trois in Act I.\nBoth the character\nparts, Queen (Jane\nHayworth) and tutor\n(Michael Coleman), were\nwell played. Providing\nlaughter and storytelling.\nRothbart (James Streeter),\nthe villain of the piece,\nis always a difficult role\nand in this production the\ncharacterisation improved\nthrough the ballet.\nIsaac Hern\u00e1ndez\nreprised his role as Prince\nSiegfried, before as a guest\nartist, now a company\nmember of the ENB.\nWhilst appearing a little\noff balance at the start of\nthe ballet and lacking in\ncharacterisation, he really\ncame into his own during\nthe later acts, especially\nwith an impressive solo\nperformance in Act III,\nwith wonderful flying\ngrand jet\u00e9s and beautiful\npirouettes.\nOdette and Odile are\ntraditionally played by\nthe same dancer. Jurgita\nDronina portrayed a\nvulnerable Odette, whilst\nmastering the flirtatious\nnature of Odile. The\nchange in character was\nnoticeable as soon as she\nstepped on stage in Act\nIII, she seems to convey\nboth characters through\nher upper body gestures\nand face with ease. Her\ntechnique is delightful,\nmastering the somewhat\nincredible 32 fouett\u00e9s in\nOdile\u2019s solo of Act III.\nThe chemistry and\npartner work between\nHern\u00e1ndez and Dronina,\nwhilst lacking in places at\nthe start, grew throughout,\nsuccessfully conveying\nthe tragic ending of Swan\nLake.\nWhilst not quite a\nMoscow performance,\ncertainly a fantastic\nEnglish ballet. Overall, a\ndelightful performance.\nStar Sharon D Clarke shines // Helen Maybank\nARTS\nVaishnavi\nWhere? The Playhouse\nTheatre\nWhen?

    "content": "ISSUE 1709\nFELIX\n14\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFlamboyant family fun with Aladdin the Panto\nT\nhis production\nof Aladdin was\na 20th year\ncelebration of\npantomime at the Hackney\nEmpire. Panto tends to\ndeviate from set plot lines,\nbut this performance uses\nAladdin as a vague guideline rather than a script.\nThere are several layers of\nnarration, starting with an\nimpressive 10ft trapped\npuppet Goddess Gaia\ntaking over the stage. The\nrest of the show is just as\nflamboyantly ridiculous.\nEven the location and\ncharacters were given an\nEast London twist, set in\nthe far off land of Ha-kaney a town that has just\nexited the Eastern Union.\nAladdin is determined to\nwin the heart of princess\nJasmine, who he is not\nlegally allowed to set eyes\non. Once they fall in love\nand decide to marry, he\nis given the challenge of\nbuilding a palace in one\nday to prove his worth to\nthe dictatorial Empress.\nThis is much to the distress of his brother Dishi,\nforever in the shadow of\nAladdin going through\nthe motions of supporting\nhim through his wacky\nadventures. To greet him,\nwe shout \u201cWhat a fittie!\u201d.\nThere are also plenty of\nopportunities to boo and\nshout \u201che\u2019s behind you!\u201d.\nAbanazar is a villain so\ntreacherous he also carries\nthe title Jacob Peas Bogg.\nIn pursuit of the lamp, he\nmust find someone pure\nof heart to retrieve it, so\nhe poses as Aladdin\u2019s\nuncle to convince him to\nrecover it. The high-jinks\nand dance numbers that\nensue are wonderfully\noutrageous with catchy\nsongs. Rather than the\ngenie, it is Aladdin\u2019s\nmother, widower Madam\nTwankey, played by Clive\nRowe (Duke from Tracy\nBeaker!) who is the real\nstar of the show. She runs\na laundrette in between\nher outrageous dance\nroutines.\nThis is a show catering\nto all the family, where\neveryone watching is\nencouraged to participate.\nThere is a sign-language\ndance routine led by a\npanda for toddlers to\npotter along to, and some\nless wholesome one-lin-ers to keep the parents\ncackling. Somehow every\ncharacter finds their way\nto a happy ending. The\ngoddess and genie is freed,\nAladdin and Jasmine live\nhappily ever after, the\nempress elopes with her\nguard Dumpling. Even\nAbanazer finds love and\nrenounces his evil past\nfor a future with Madam\nTwankey. Bizarre, but\nwonderful.\nPinter Six: Money can\u2019t buy you love\nNow past the halfway\nmark, Jamie Lloyd\u2019s\nseason of Pinter plays\ncontinues to astonish with\neach new installment.\nWhat\u2019s impressive is the\ncuration \u2013 the plays are\ngrouped by subject matter,\nrather than chronology,\nshowcasing the themes\nthat Pinter revisited\nmultiple times throughout\nhis career as a playwright.\nPinter Six is all about\nsharp satire of the upper\nclass: unhappiness, coarse\nvulgarity and downright\ncruelty lying behind a outwardly civilised fa\u00e7ade.\nParty Time is set at\nan opulent dinner party,\ngiven for the rich by the\nrich. The guests swan\nabout in smug self-supe-riority, uttering vacuous\nphrases of small talk.\nA civil war seems to be\ngoing on outside, but the\nonly hint of unease comes\nwhen Dusty (Eleanor\nMatsura) interrupts to ask\nher husband Terry (John\nSimm) what has happened\nto her brother Jimmy. The\natmosphere in the party\nchanges; Terry tells at\nher to shut up or she\u2019ll be\n\u2018spanked\u2019; the host of the\nparty, Gavin (Phil Davis),\nmakes a disapproving\nremark about \u2018uncontrollable wives\u2019. A set of giant\ndoors at the back of the\nstage glow at intervals, as\nthe riot outside continually threatens to break in\nand disrupt the insulated\nlife of the dinner party.\nThe finale, where Jimmy\n(Abraham Popoola)\nbursts through the doors\ndripping with blood, is a\nbit too heavy-handed for\nmy liking, though it does\nget the point across. \u2018The\ndark is in my mouth and\nI suck it\u2026 it\u2019s the only\nthing I have.\u2019 Outside the\ncushy world of the party, a\nhopeless blackness looms\nfor the rest of society. It\u2019s\nhard to pick a standout\nfrom the cast, who are all\nexcellent. I particularly\nenjoyed Simm\u2019s ability\nto deliver spine-chilling\nmenace in a deceptively\npleasant voice. Casting\nMatsura, who is half-Jap-anese, and Popoola, who\nis of Nigerian descent, as\nthe only two who seem\nout of place in the cushy\nworld of Party Time also\nlends \u2013 intentionally or\notherwise \u2013 racial undertones to this staging.\nThe cast of nine remains\nthe same for Celebration,\nthis time a more intimate\nlook at the emptiness of\nrelationships. Like Party\nTime, its cheery title\nbelies the bleak tone of\nthe play. Two brothers,\nmarried to two sisters,\nare at \u2018the most expensive restaurant in town\u2019,\nostensibly to celebrate\nthe wedding anniversary\nof one of the couples,\nLambert (Ron Cook)\nand Prue (Celia Imrie).\nIt soon becomes clear\nthat true affection is not\nto be found in any of the\nrelationships on display.\nHusbands and wives undermine each other with\nsnide remarks throughout\ndinner, with vulgarity\nand warped familial ties\nbeing the theme of the\nday. \u2018All mothers want\ntheir sons to be fucked by\nthemselves,\u2019 Prue insists,\nwhile reminiscing about\nhow her mother used to\nbeat her father till there\nwas blood on the sheets.\nSuki (Katherine Kingsley)\nand her husband Russell\n(Simm) are no better;\nRussell confesses to an\naffair with a secretary,\nonly for Suki to regain the\nupper hand with her tales\nof when she was a \u2018plump\nyoung secretary\u2019 with her\nshare of filing-cabinet\nliaisons. In the middle of\nthese unhappy conversa-tions, the restaurant waiter\n(Popoola) makes frequent\n\u2018interjections\u2019 about his\ngrandfather, longing for\na past of culture and tradition which is long gone.\nSoutra Gilmour\u2019s set\nand costume design are\ncommendable for how\nboth plays manage to\ndisgust us equally in\ntheir overt, though very\ndifferent, displays of\nopulence. Sleek black\nglamour for Party Time\nwith its constant sense of\nthreat, ritzy glitter for the\n(relatively) light-hearted\nCelebration.\nI previously reviewed\nPinter Four, a stunning\ncollection of short\nsketches in which Pinter\nexplored the unreliability\nof memory \u2013 as escapism,\nas bond. Here, too, recollection is subjective for\nLambert and Suki. Their\npast relationship is such\na precious memory to\nLambert \u2013 \u201cI fell in love\nonce\u2026 and [she] loved\nme back\u201d \u2013 that he uncharacteristically foots the\nbill for everyone, Suki and\nRussell included. Suki, on\nthe other hand, believes\nhe never loved anything\nmore than her body. For\nall the casual cruelty in\nCelebration, it\u2019s this repudiation of the one shred\nof genuine emotion in the\nplay that hits the hardest.\nCelebration ends with the\nspotlight on the waiter,\nwho is about to make\n\u2018one last interjection\u2019 \u2013\nbut what is it? Will it be\na solution to the toxicity\nof these relationships, a\nway to reclaim genuine\nwarmth? We will never\nknow.\nDespite being written\n9 years apart, the two\nplays echo each other\nremarkably. Once again,\nJamie Lloyd shows us\nhow Pinter is still relevant\ntoday - more relevant\nthan ever in today\u2019s\npolitical climate, in fact,\nwith its ever-growing\ndivide between the haves\nand have-nots. The false\nveneer masking a far\nbleaker reality in these\ntwo plays also resonates\nwith the false perfection\nof our online lives and\nsocial media, despite the\nloneliness and nihilism\nthat seem to dog our gen-eration. A thought-pro-voking pairing not to be\nmissed.\nHijinks and happily ever afters // Hackney Empire\nARTS\nSimran Kukran\nArts Writer\nWhere? Hackney Empire\nWhen? Ran till 6th Jan\nHow Much?

The duo doesn\u2019t\nconfine themselves to\none or even a couple of\nmediums: their installations come as full experi-ences. As I walk through\nthe doors at the gallery I\nenter into a room with a\nlarge swimming pool in\nthe middle. I could be in\nan abandoned Hungarian\nbath, but I\u2019m in an art\ngallery. The setting is\nthe Whitechapel Pool, a\npublic swimming pool\nfor the local community,\nsupposedly at its peak\nduring the 70s. The pool\nand the whole story are\nof course just fictional\nproducts painting a\nvibrant story for the ex-hibition. It\u2019s not just the\npool in the room though;\na fallen large sculpture,\na metallic car seat and a\nbig rock weighing down a\ntrampoline are a few other\nthings scattered around\nthe room. Everything is\nrun-down and abandoned.\nThere is sand and dust on\nthe bottom of the pool.\nIt\u2019s a story of gentrification that Elmgreen and\nDragset have painted up\nhere. It is a story of taking\nsomething away from the\ncommunity and giving it\nto capitalism. This used\nto be a communal pool\nbustling with life, but\nnow it is going to be made\ninto a luxurious spa for\nmembers only.\nThe pool is not the\nonly installation in the\nexhibition. On my way up\nthe stairs I come to face\nan ATM machine on the\nwall. On the floor beneath\nlays a baby in a bassinet.\nI freeze up for a second\nand look around, wondering who could have left\ntheir baby here. I see the\ngallery guards smirking\nover at my reaction. The\nbaby is a wax doll, a very\nbelievable one. Elmgreen\n& Dragset: 1, Amanda:\n0. The installation raises\nquestions; what could\nthe guardian of this child\npossibly have seen on\nthe screen / have been\ndoing at the ATM before\ndeciding to leave their\nbaby behind?\nEven this is not all there\nis, there is a room full of\nmore shocking sculptures,\nand another room titled\n\u2018Self-portraits\u2019. I\u2019ll let you\nfind out what\u2019s in there\non your own though. The\nwork of Elmgreen and\nDragset is truly performed\nin such a thoughtful and\nsuccessful way. Living in\nthe reality of 2018, with\ncapitalism, gentrification,\npopulism and a push for\nequality, I think art needs\nto address these topics,\nand discovering new ways\nto execute this since the\ngraffiti of the 80s is even\nbetter. I would even highly\nsuggest checking out the\nartists and their previous\ninstallations online. Definitely not your average\nexhibition at the National\nGallery.\nB\norn and brought\nup in London,\nr e p e a t e d l y\nvisiting this\ngallery with my father\nsince before I could even\nwalk, it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019m a\nhardcore National Gallery\ndevotee. Unfortunately,\nthis is precisely the same\nreason this exhibition left\nme feeling a sense of unfamiliar disappointment\nas I left the building, for\nthe first time in my life.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\n\u2013 the exhibition itself\nincludes a mesmerising\nset of paintings, the\nunification of Samuel\nCourtauld\u2019s historically split up collection\n(between the National\nGallery and the Courtauld\nGallery); it would be\nabsurd of anyone to deny\nthe mastery of Seurat\u2019s\n\u2018Bathers at Asni\u00e8res\u2019,\nor Manet\u2019s \u2018A Bar at the\nFolies-Berg\u00e8re\u2019.\nPerhaps I just had\noverly high expectations,\nor I hyped the exhibition\nup too much in my\nown head \u2013 a glorious,\nground-breaking union of\nall the greatest Impressionist and Post-Impressionist pieces London,\nor indeed the UK, had to\noffer. Or perhaps I was\nhoping for something a\nlittle bit different, or some\nsort of examination of the\npieces in a new or different way \u2013 I\u2019m not really\nsure. Instead what we get\nis the Courtauld collection\ncoupled with select pieces\nfrom the National Gallery,\nand an admission charge\nstuck on it. Many of the\npainting descriptions for\nNational Gallery pieces\nwere essentially the same\nas they usually are in the\nfree collection, so I felt\na bit robbed. Equally, I\nimagine those on holiday\nwho came to visit the\nregular free National\nGallery Impressionism\ncollection, only to find\nhalf of the pieces taken\naway and put in a paid\nexhibition, must also be\nfeeling robbed.\nWhilst I liked the way\nit was split up by artist,\nwith each section titled\nusing emboldened prints\nof their signature, it meant\nthat it was difficult to\ncross-examine themes\nand techniques between\nartists. Further, with only\na few paintings by each\nartist, there also weren\u2019t\nenough paintings to see\ndevelopment in their own\nstyles. However, there\nwas sufficient relevant\nand interesting information about every artist and\neach painting, making\nit ideal for those who\nhaven\u2019t experienced much\nImpressionism, or really\nlove it and haven\u2019t yet\nseen London\u2019s collection\nbefore, with the decent\nprice tag of \u00a37.50 in such\na case.\nThe way you\u2019ll feel\nabout this exhibition\nreally just depends on\nwho you are and your\ncircumstances. If you\u2019ve\nbeen to the National\nGallery countless times,\nand have either been to\nthe Courtauld before or\nhave time to spare until\nit reopens in 2 years, I\u2019m\nnot sure if this exhibition\nis worth it. Considering\nthe \u00a38 admission for the\nCourtauld, with access\nto 3 times as much art as\nthis exhibition (including\n2 other art periods along\nwith this Impressionism\ncollection), and the fact\nthat the Courtauld itself\nis only a 10 minute walk\naway on the other end of\nStrand, it would be easily\ndoable in one day when\nthe collections are both\nback in their respective\nnormal locations.\nBut if you have limited\ntime in London and can\u2019t\nafford to wait 2 years, or\nare simply eager to feast\nyour eyes on this astounding collection, then \u00a37.50\nis still a pretty good deal.\nC\u00e9zanne\u2019s The Card Players // Courtauld Gallery\nA dive into harsh reality // Whitechapel Gallery\nSpend an afternoon literally diving into the\ngentrification of East London.\nARTS\nAmanda Hertzberg\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Few modern\nstagings have carved\ntheir place in the history\nof the male ballet star, or\nindeed into the form itself\nas Matthew Bourne\u2019s\nSwan Lake. A punk rock\nreimagining, at the time\nof its first performance\nit took the Tchaikovsky\nscored classic and tried\nto blow it up from the\ninside, feathered tutus and\nall. Bourne recounts that\nduring its first run little\ngirls left the performances\nin tears, sobbing that their\nparents had bought tickets\nto the wrong Swan Lake.\nPerhaps only a stranger\nto the worlds of buns and\npointe shoes, as Bourne\nwas at the time, would\u2019ve\ndared such a thing.\nWatching this revival\nI was struck by how\nprofound a transformation\nBourne\u2019s staging is from\nthe original. This is no\ngimmicky gender-swap,\nbutashiftintone,message,\nand story. I was struck too\nat how similar it seemed\nto Ballet Black\u2019s Midsummer\u2019s Night Dream\nthat was performed at The\nBarbican some months\ngo, evidence that Bourne\nhas had an influence in\nmodern ballet that has\nstood the test of time. In\nBourne\u2019s Swan Lake we\nfollow a pampered but\naffection-deprived Prince\nas he seems to find love,\nis betrayed, then finds\npassion and freedom in\nthe unlikeliest of places.\nWill Bozier is tremendous\nas the Swan; bare chested,\nforehead marked with\nwar paint, he dances with\nmuscularity and avian\ngrace. If the traditional tu-tu-performances of Swan\nLake depict the swans\nwith the ethereal beauty\nof Edwardian paintings,\nBourne\u2019s swans bare their\ndinosaur hearts. Sometimes ungainly, sometimes\nferocious, always otherworldly they disrupt the\nproper-ness of the palace\nscenes with wildness.\nBourne\u2019s staging has\nalways been hailed as\n\u201cthe gay Swan Lake\u201d,\ncertainly the pas-de-deux between the Prince\n(Dominic North) and the\nSwan King are passionate\nand tender, but it is also an\node to the chaos of nature,\na rejection of rigid rules\nand carefully observed\nmanners. Peppered\nwith pantomime-esque\nhumour, the staging sings\nwith irreverent energy, in\nparticular, Carrie Willis\nas the The Girlfriend is\nscene-stealingly good.\nIf casting the Swan\nQueen and her cast of\nswans as male dancers\nwas a challenge in the\n90s then maintaining that\nsense of revolution and\ndrama, nearly twenty\nyears later as the now\nclassic returns to Sadler\u2019s\nWells is no less of a feat.\nWith humour, great verve,\nand a fantastic corps\nof dancers, Swan Lake\ndelivers.\nThe Curious Incident:ATriumphant Return to London\nA\ndapted from\nMark Haddon\u2019s\nbook of the\nsame name,\nthis The Curious Incident\nof the Dog in the Nighttime tells the story of\nChristopher Boone, a\n15-year-old who is exceptionally gifted at maths yet\nstruggles with social interactions and many every\nday tasks. Christopher\nfinds his neighbour\u2019s dog,\nWellington, murdered in\nher garden and decides\nto begin an investigation\ninto who could be the\nculprit, recording all of\nhis interactions in a book.\nA simplistic description\nof the plot does little\nto capture the magic\nthat is this production.\nYes, this is a story about\nChristopher, but through\nhis interactions with those\nhe encounters it becomes\nso much more, an exploration of humanity itself.\nPlaywright Simon\nStephens does a phenomenal job of translating\nthe play to the stage. He\nremains faithful to the\nmuch loved book, yet\nmanages to tailor it to\neverything that makes\ntheatre so enjoyable. To\nsay that the set and staging\nare amazing would be a\ncriminal understatement.\nThe ingenious multimedia\nset transports you into\nChristopher\u2019s world,\ngiving you an insight into\nhow he sees things, with\nChristopher\u2019s diagrams\nspringing to life on the\nwalls. One of the things\nmost striking about the\nbook is Christopher\u2019s\nsensory overload by the\nsights and sounds of busy\nLondon. Haddon\u2019s words\nreally created a sense of\npalpable distress that I\nwas certain could not be\nreplicated. Yet this fantastic production proved me\nwrong. The abstract use\nof sound, light and stage\ncombine to transport you\nstraight into Cristopher\u2019s\nmind. Director Marianne\nElliott does a great job\nof bringing together all\nthese different elements to\ncreate a truly immersive\nexperience.\nThis production has\nbeen through many cast\nchanges since its debut\nat The National Theatre\nand it\u2019s a worry to any fan\nof the original if the new\ncasts are able to replicate\nthe initial magic. There\u2019s\nno question here that they\ndo: Joshua Jenkins is\nfantastic as Christopher,\nnever failing to capture\nhis vulnerability and con-fusion. Stuart Laing and\nEmma Beattie are brilliant\nas Christopher\u2019s parents\nEd and Judy, each of\nthem is vulnerable in their\nown way, burdened by\ncircumstances. Laing in\nparticular really captures\nthe essence of Ed; its impossible not to feel a rush\nof sympathy for him in the\nmoments where he breaks\ndown in front of Christopher. Rounding out the\nmain cast is Julie Hale,\nplaying Christopher\u2019s\nsupport worker at school,\nSiobhan.\nWords cannot describe\nhow brilliant this performance is and honestly,\nany fan of theatre should\ntreat themselves to it. As\nthe cast took their bows, I\ndon\u2019t think I could see a\nsingle person seated, we\nwere all up and giving this\nplay the standing ovation\nit clearly deserved.\nMaybe swans do fly afterall// Tristam Kenton\nARTS\nIndira Malik\nArts Editor\nWhere?

To explain the\nidea of a yield curve, one\nneeds to understand what\nexactly a yield is. A yield\nto maturity, or simply\nbond yield has multiple\ninterpretation, the simplest being \u2013 it is the return\nan investor realises on a\nbond. For instance, a yield\nof 4.5% on a bond implies\nthat an investor would get\na return equivalent to a\n4.5% annual interest rate\nin a bank account. Bond\nyields are inversely related to bond prices, when\nbond prices are low, the\nyields are high, vice versa.\nHowever, high\nyields are not always\nideal. During the Greek\ndebt crisis and Greek\nbond default, Greek\ngovernment bond yields\n(10Y) reached yield as\nhigh as 48.60 before\nthe Greek government\ndefaulted. Bond yields,\nwhile giving a yardstick\nfor retail investors to\ncompare the returns on\ntheir investment between\ndifferent bonds, does\nnot account for the\nrisk of default \u2013 hence\nastronomically high yields\nimplies that investors are\nvaluing the bonds very\nlow prices to account for\nthe likelihood of default.\nMoving on, a yield\ncurve simply illustrates\nthe yields of a type of\nbond against the maturity\nof the same bond (e.g.\nyield of 10Y U.S. bond\nagainst the maturity of 10\nYears). A standard yield\ncurve is shown below.\nThere are 3 crucial things\nto understand about the\nyield curve:\nHowever, when bond\ntraders suspect that\nthe FED would lower\ninterest rates in light of\nan impending recession,\nbond traders would\nbegan buying long-term\ngovernment bonds as\nthe price of long-term\ngovernment bonds would\nrise when the FED lower\ninterest rates. Hence\nbond traders would\nbegin buying long-term\ngovernment bonds and\nthis would lower the yield\nof long-term government\nbonds. This reflects a\npessimistic investor\nsentiment towards the\nmarket, and it is a strong\nwarning sign of an\nimpending recession.\nOverall, it can be\nobserved that a yield\ncurve inversion \u2013 when\nthe yields of long-term\ngovernment bonds\nbecomes lower than\nthe yields of short-term\ngovernment bond, it is a\nstrong warning sign of\nan impending recession.\nHistorically, the bond\ncurve has inverted 7\ntimes since the 1980s,\nout of which, 6 times the\nbond curve inversion has\npredicted and preceded\nrecession. The 6 times\nwere: the two 1970s oil\ncrisis, the 1980s recession,\nthe 1990s recession, the\nearly 2000s dotcom burst,\nand the 2008 Global\nFinancial Crisis. Each\ntime, the bond curve\ninversion happened less\nthan 2 years prior to each\nrecession.\nIn recent times, the\nspread between the\n3-year and 5-year U.S.\ngovernment bond has\nturned negative (i.e. one\nsegment of the yield curve\nhas inverted). Moreover,\nthe spread between the\n2-year and 10-year U.S.\ngovernment bond lies\nat 17.6bp (or 0.176%\npoint spread). While the\ncurrent yield curve has\nyet to be fully inverted, it\ncan be seen that the yield\ncurve is flattening Given\nthe hawkish stance the\nFED has been assuming\n(hawkish refers to the FED\nclosely watching inflation\nand would likely raise\nrates), the flattening of the\nyield curve implies that\nbond traders suspect that\nthe FED would assume a\ndovish position in the near\nfuture. Ironically, the Fed\nstill chose to raise interest\nrates in Dec 2018 despite\nthe foretelling signs of\nyield curve inversion \u2013 a\nharbinger of recession.\nNevertheless, it is\nimperative to keep in mind\nthat the timeline between\nyield curve inversion and\neconomic recessions are\nnot instantaneous. The\nyield between the three to\nfive year maturity bonds\ndipped below zero during\nAugust 2005, two years\nprior to the start of the\nGlobal Financial Crisis.\n1. Short-term\ngovernment bonds (<2\nYears) typically has a\nlower yield relative to\nlong-maturity government\nbonds because long-maturity bonds tend to\nhave a higher default risk\n(hencethepricesof10year\nmaturity bonds tend to be\nlower and their yields tend\nto be higher). i.e. the Yield\ncurve is upward sloping in\na normal scenario.\n2. Short-term\ngovernment bond yields\nare controlled by the\ncentral bank via monetary\npolicy. In the U.S. context,\nthis is done by adjusting\nthe Federal Funds Rate\nor by carrying out Open\nMarket Operations (Sale\nor purchase of government\nbonds). When the U.S.\nCentral Bank (the FED)\nraises the Fed funds rate,\nthis increases the cost of\nborrowing for overnight\nloans by commercial\nbank and commercial\nbanks would raise their\ninterest rates conversely.\nIn times of inflations\n(high economic growth/\nOverheating), the FED\nwould raise interest rates\nto relieve the inflationary\npressure while during\ntimes of deflations\n(recessions), the FED\nwould lower interest rates.\n3. The long-term\ngovernment bond yields\nare controlled by bond\ntraders and reflects the\nsentimentsofbondtraders.\nFor instance, when the\nmarket is performing\nwell, bond traders would\nexpect that the FED would\nraise interest rates, and\nconversely, this would\nlower the price of bonds\nand increases yields. Bond\ntraders in turn, would\nstart selling the long-term\nbonds in anticipation\nof this rate hike (and\ndecrease in bond prices),\nleading to high yields for\nthe long-term government\nbonds. In this sense, an\nupward sloping yield\ncurve reflects a healthy\neconomy.\n\u201cPessimistic\ninvestor\nsentiment ...\nstrong warning\nsign of an\nimpending\nrecession\u201d\nFortelling Turbulent Times Ahead? // Highcharts.com\nBond Curve Yield Inversion\nWill the Fed continue down its hawkish path? // Bloomberg\nISSUE 1709\nFELIX\n25\nINVESTMENT icu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk\nINVESTMENT\nDike Dijemeni &\nEsuabom Dijemeni\nInvestment Writers\nI\nn the past, industry\nspecific start-up\n\u201crules of thumb\u201d may\nhavebeensufficientto\nserve as reasonable basis\nfor any valuation concern.\nCombined with the unique\nmarket dynamics and\nregulatory environment\nassociated with the medical technology industry,\nstart-ups in this field\npresent a unique set of\nvaluation considerations.\nIn recent years, valuation\nissues have become increasingly important for\nstart-up companies due\nto changing international\nreporting standards and\nfinancial reporting rules.\nThese issues along with\nincreasing regulatory\nand shareholder scrutiny\ntogether compound potential troubles for start-up\ncompanies. Because both\nthe subject enterprise and\nvaluation purpose are\nmisfits within the context\nof typical valuation work,\nvaluation practices are\ngenerally not applicable\nfor start-up companies.\nIn reality, the appropriate\ndefinition of value varies\ndepending on the circumstances surrounding each\nvaluation engagement.\nThis article discusses\ncommon circumstances\nthat give rise to the need\nfor a valuation, basic\nvaluation concepts, and\nspecific valuation considerations relevant to\nmedical technology startup companies.\nFirstly, what are the\nmost common standards\nof value for start-up\ncompanies? There are\nbroadly two standards\nof value for start-ups:\nfair market value and\ninvestment value. Fair\nmarket value is the most\ncommon standard of value\nused in business appraisals\nis available in sufficient\nquantity and quality. The\nmarketapproachcompares\nthe subject to similar\nbusinesses, business\nownership interests, or\nother assets that have\nbeen recently transacted.\nHowever, such per share\npricing information from\ncapital rounds provides\nhelpful valuation anchors\nin the form of upper or\nlower boundaries for\nenterprise value, and\ncan credibly substantiate\nthe reasonableness of\nvaluation conclusions.\nConsideration of prior\ncompleted financing\nrounds or other\ntransactions in interests\nof a start-up is also a\nmethod under the market\napproach.\nMarket methods\ninclude comparison\nof the subject interest\nwith valuation metrics\nimplied by investments in\npublicly traded companies\nand those implied by\ntransactions involving\ncontrolling interests in\nsimilar companies. Most\nstart-ups are not near\nIPO or acquisition, so\nthere is generally not\nsufficient information to\nimplement the market\napproach to determine\nthe enterprise value for\nstart-up enterprises with\nthe exception of the\noccasional very late stage\nstart-up.\nThirdly, what valuation\nconsiderations should be\naccounted for in medical\ntechnology start-ups?\nValuation of medical\ntechnology start-ups take\ninto account anticipated\nfuture capital needs, the\nprobability of successful\nexit, time to successful\nexit, and the potential\nexit value. For medical\ntechnology companies,\nexit events are usually\nvia acquisition or IPOs.\nFurthermore, exit events\nand values are influenced\nby four factors which are\nmarket characteristics,\nmarket impact, stage of\ndevelopment, and key\nsuccess indicators.\nAll companies operate\nwithin a given market and\nthis context is perhaps the\nmost significant factor\nin the exit valuation of a\nmedical technology start-up. The most significant\nmarket factor to consider\nfor a medical technology\nstart-up is the absolute\nsize and growth prospects\nfor the pertinent market.\nEven if a start-up has\neverything else in place,\n100% market share of\nnothing is still nothing.\nOther than the\ndisruptive potential of\nthe new technology itself,\nstrategic acquirers in\nthe medical technology\nspace commonly consider\na variety of factors in\nevaluating the potential\nmarket. These factors\ninclude impact of a new\ntechnology, strength of\nintellectual property,\nstability of design,\ntechnical performance\ndata, support from\nhuman clinical studies,\ncompletion of regulatory\napprovals, and reputation\nof \u201cearly-adopter\u201d using\ntechnology, reliability\nof supply chain and\ndistribution partners, and\navailability of technical\nexpertise.\nMost medical\ntechnology start-ups\ntend to follow similar\npatterns in operational\ndevelopment regardless\nof industry segment.\nThe value of a given\nstart-up is largely related\nto its level of operational\ndevelopment. Generally,\nmeeting later-stage\nmilestones generates\ngreater increases in value\nthan that of earlier-stage\nmilestones.\nDue to this relative lack\nof information, qualitative\nfactors such as the quality\nof the management\nteam, clinical advisory\nteam, and venture capital\ninvestor group become an\nimportant consideration,\nespecially in the valuation\nof early-stage start-ups.\nIn conclusion, given\nthe incremental valuation\ncomplexities particular\nto medical technology\nstart-up enterprises, it is\nimportant to remember\nthat industry knowledge\nand valuation knowledge\nare not synonymous\u2014and\nboth are important. Firstly,\nthe definition of value by\nan investor or investing\ngroup determines how\nvalue is attributed to a\nmedical technology start-up: a start-up can have\nmultiple values attributed\nbased on value definition.\nSecondly, the value of a\nmedical start-up depends\non the unique investing\napproach of an investor\n/ investing group: a\nstart-up can have multiple\nvalues based on investing\napproach. Thirdly, the\nvalue of a medical\ntechnology start-up\nsignificantly depends on\nits market characteristics,\nmarket impact, product\ndevelopment stage, and\nkey success indications.\nFinally, we encourage\nreaders to extend business\ndialogue to include\nvaluation and specific\nvaluation considerations\nrelevant to medical\ntechnology start-up\ncompanies.\nand is the standard used\nfor compliance related\nto equity compensation.\nOn the other hand,\ninvestment value is the\nvalue to a specific investor\nbased on their particular\ninvestment requirements\nand opportunities.\nSecondly, what are\nthe general approaches\nto determining business\nvalue? There are three\ngeneral approaches to\ndetermining business\nvalue \u2013 asset, income,\nand market. Ultimately,\nthe conclusion of value\nwill reflect consideration\nof one or more of these\napproaches (and perhaps\nvarious underlying\nmethods) as being most\nindicative of value for the\nsubjectownershipinterest.\nThe asset approach can\nprovide meaningful\nvaluation benchmarks\nfor start-ups that have\nrecently completed\nfund-raising rounds.\nFor start-up companies,\nthe asset approach is\ngenerally inappropriate to\napply unless the start-up\nis in a very early stage of\noperational development\nsuch that there has been\nno intellectual property\nor other intangible value\ndeveloped internally.\nAccordingly, single-period capitalization of\nincome methods and\nconventional applications\nof discounted future\nbenefits methods are\nrarely appropriate to use.\nThe mechanics of an\nincome method require\nan estimate of future cash\nflows and an appropriate\ndiscount rate with which\nto determine the present\nvalue of future cash flows.\nThe income approach is\nbased on the idea that\nthe value for a given\nenterprise is created by the\nexpectation of future cash\nflows and thus focuses on\nthe capacity of a start-up\ncompany to generate\nfuture economic benefits.\nThe market approach\nis the preferred approach\nwhen appropriate data\n\u201cValue is\nlargely related\nto its level of\noperational\ndevelopment\u201d\nHow are Medical Start-ups Valued// Tech Republic\nValuation of Medical Technology Start-Ups\n\n"

However, there\nis also data suggesting the\npotentially jeopardizing\neffect of this trend on meat\nproduction requirements.\nIt shouldn\u2019t come as a\nsurprise that to produce\nmeat, the animals need to\nbe fed first. This translates\ninto much higher demand\nfor both land and water\nusage. Raising livestock\nfor food production\nuses 83% of the world\u2019s\nfarmland and accounts\nfor 56-58% of agricultural\npollutant emissions, but\nprovides only 37% of our\nprotein and 18% of caloric\nintake, according to an\nOxford University study.\nThe study also stated that\neven the lowest impact\nmeat and dairy products\nstill pose more environmental threat than the least\nsustainable vegetables and\ncereals (so, keep dipping\nyour pita in hummus).\nThe land is mostly used\nfor production of animal\nfeed and grazing, which\ncan be detrimental to\nwildlife through deforestation and alterations to\ntheir habitats. Furthermore, ruminant farming\nis still infamous for its\ngreenhouse gas (GHG)\nemission; in particular,\nthe potent GHG methane.\nThe arable land also needs\nto be irrigated for crop\nproduction, meaning that\nanimal products require\nfar more water than crops\nalone, because of the\ncolossal amount of feed\nthat go into their produc-tion. The livestock sector\nis now considered to be\nthe number one water\npolluter, due to the waste\nassociated with livestock\nfarming.

    "content": "A power shift?\nThe digital transformation in the oil industry\nTECH\nSharada Joshi\nEnergy Journal\nO\nnce upon a\ntime, around\n30 years ago,\nthe oil industry\nwas at the forefront of\ntechnological innovation,\npushing boundaries with\ncreations borne out of\nnecessity, such as digital\nwell logs, electrical submersible pumps and 3D\nseismic imaging tools,\nwhich use sound waves\nto create a 3D image of\ngeological formations.\nIn years following, the\nfocus shifted. As oil prices\nskyrocketed in 2011, the\naim became maximizing\nproduction and, in relative\nterms, technology took a\nbackseat . However, with\noil prices currently at $72/\nbarrel , the narrative has\nshifted again. The players\nin this tumultuous market\nhave started looking to\nnew technologies, driven\nby the need to become\nmore efficient in order to\nremain profitable. But as\ncompanies embark on this\ndigital transformation, a\nnatural question emerges:\nHow will this affect the\npeople working there? Is\npower being transferred\nfrom the people to the\nlatest technology?\nAn example of the industry\u2019s latest endeavour\nto embrace technology\nis BP\u2019s partnership\nwith Beyond Limits, an\nAmerican artificial intelligence company based\nin Los Angeles. The aim\nis to utilise cognitive\nartificial intelligence (AI),\na system that uses models\nto simulate human reasoning when faced with\ncomplex problems by\n\u2018learning\u2019 how geologists\nand petroleum engineers\nthink; it then mimics their\napproach when faced\nwith challenges. The\nbenefits are huge \u2013 AI can\ncatalogue unused ideas\nfrom discussions between\nengineers, it can bring\nup relevant suggestions\nwhen a problem needs to\nbe solved quickly and,\nbecause it has been trained\nby experts (who will at\nsome point retire), it can\ndigitally store their knowledge and expertise for the\nbenefit of future genera-tions. Does this mean that\nfewer engineers will be\nneeded in the upstream\nsector in the future?\nAccording to the Journal\nof Petroleum Technology,\n\u201cmany analysts do not\nsee the mass replacement\nof human engineering\ntalent on the immediate\nhorizon.\u201d This perhaps\nimplies that although the\ntransfer of power from\npeople to technology is\nnot happening right now, it\nwill inevitably become the\nreality of the future. The\ngraph shows that, post-oil\nprice collapse, the number\nof oil rigs has increased\nsubstantially again, a\ntrend not entirely echoed\nby industry employment\nfigures. Meanwhile, the\nproduction figures show\na near-steady increase.\nThus, a conclusion that\none can perhaps draw\nfrom this is that digital\ntransformation has already\nhad some impact in terms\nof productivity and efficiency on the oil industry;\nclearly, higher production\nlevels are being achieved\nby a smaller workforce.\nHowever, the CEO of\nBeyond Limits puts\nforward a different per-spective: \u201cWe are creating\na collaboration between\nman and machine\u201d, he\nsays, \u201cto amplify human\ntalent\u201d. Perhaps one could\nthen view this shift not as\npower to the people, but\nas the sharing of power\nbetween people and tech-nology.\nAnadarko is another\ncompany undergoing a\ntechnological transfor-mation; it now employs\nalmost 20 data scientists\nin its Advanced Analytics\nand Emerging Technologiesgroup.Othermembers\ninclude geoscience and\nengineering experts. The\nadvantage of such a collaboration is immediately\nobvious \u2013 it increases\nknowledge across all\ndisciplines and promotes\ncreativity. The team aims\nto test new concepts and\naccelerate technological\ndevelopment to enhance\n\u201ccompetitive advantage\nin the exploration and\nproduction space\u201d . An\nexample of such a project\nis the integrated production surveillance and\noptimisation platform,\nIPSO. IPSO, which\nbreaks down and filters\ndata like pressure and\ntemperature changes in\nwells into digestible and\neasy-to-monitor bits, was\nan unprecedented success\nwhen it was deployed for\nuse in the Gulf of Mexico;\nit was fully operational\n97% of the time in the first\n6 months . To continue\nsuch breakthroughs,\nmore data scientists are\nneeded, yet the Journal\nof Petroleum Technology\ncomments that \u201cthe\nupstream industry has\nopenly acknowledged in\nrecent years that it is not\nthe most attractive sector\nfor data scientists\u201d . Thus,\nit seems that emerging\ntechnologies can play a\nrole in encouraging such\nrecruitment and multidisciplinary teamwork, a\nsure sign that power still\nremains with the people.\nplatforms has many more\nbenefits than just eliminating health and safety\nconcerns; labour costs are\ndrastically reduced and\nother costs such as helicopter use are eliminated.\nTo reduce these \u2018inefficiencies\u2019, technologies\nsuch as the Iron Roughneck have been rolled out.\nThis connects drill pipe\nsegments, a dangerous and\nrepetitive task previously\ndone by hand. Drones can\ncollect data in five days;\nit takes rope-access technicians about eight weeks\nto undertake the same\namount of work . So, what\nhappens to the workers\nwhen these powers are\ntransferred from people\nto automation? It\u2019s estimated that automated\ndrilling rigs could reduce\nthe workforce on a rig by\nup to 40% in the future.\nHowever Chris Robart,\nAmbyint\u2019s president of\nUS Operations takes a\ndifferent view: \u201cWe are\nfreeing up individuals to\ngo do other things, like\nthink about new technol-ogy, troubleshoot failed\nequipment, deal with\nworkovers, or new well\ndesigns.\u201d Clearly, these\nnew tasks require a com-The trend in industry employment and rig count in the USA // KansasCityFed\n\u201cIs power\nbeing\ntransferred\nfrom the\npeople to\nthe latest\ntechnology?\u201d\nTECH\nFRIDAY, 11TH\nJANUARY, 2019 FELIX\ntecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\npletely different skillset to\nthe labour-intensive jobs\nthat AI and automation\nare replacing.\nFrom Iron roughnecks\nto drones to the applications ofAI, the oil industry\nhas certainly embraced\nthis era of technology,\nfocusing on increasing\nefficiency and improving\nsafety. This additional\npower to technology\nthough, comes with additional costs to the people\nof the workforce. For\nthe foreseeable future at\nleast, oil rigs will not all\nbecome fully automated.\nBut we are witnessing\nthe birth of shared power,\nas machines become increasingly better at tasks\nhumans were employed to\ndo.
