It\u2019s one\nof the main reasons he gained such\nmassive attention and appeal across\nthe world, and this shock value didn\u2019t\nsubside through out the release of his\nfollowing 3 albums over the next 5\nyears.\nAll of this of course is no news to any\nlistener of hip-hop and rap. But what is\nsurprising, is that, after a 5-year hiatus\nhe has managed to surpass himself in\nhis latest outing, in the form of his and\nHesham Farag\nback in time and open for the Beatles,\nbut I think Rolling Stones, Madison\nSquare Gardens, is kind of like one of\nthose gigs that nothing is ever going to\ncome close to. It was pretty awesome.\nCW: Are you playing any UK festivals this summer?\nJS: Yeah, I think we\u2019re doing Glastonbury, one of the wireless shows in Hyde\nPark, and then Reading and Leeds.\nCW: What\u2019s your favourite\nfestival?\nJS: I really like Coachella, I\u2019ve never\nplayed Glastonbury, Reading\u2019s like a\nmassive Carling-fest. It great if you like\nswimming in a giant vat of Carling.\nCW: I think it\u2019s changed, the Carling branding has been removed\nso you might have a different\nbeer to swim in this year\nJS: Wow, imagine if it were all orange\njuice\u2026\nSlim again, Eminem returns from a shady break\nDr Dre\u2019s love child: Relapse.\nAs some of you may know, he has\nspent part of this time in rehab for addiction to sleeping pills, and as anyone\nwho saw him on Friday Night with\nJonathan Ross last week will find hard\nto believe, he has now been sober for\nover a year.\nThis is a point he will not let you\nforget throughout the record, starting\nwith the intro, which is a humorous\nmock-up of his discharge from hos-pital, starring Dominic West, better\nknown as Jimmy McNulty from the\nT.V. series The Wire.\nOther than this new subject that he\nhas introduced to his material, much\nof the same themes from his previous\nreleases remain, including; his mother,\ndrugs, violence and sex. The latter of\nwhich is incorporated into the track,\nInsane, (which by the way, is fucking\ninsane! And not it in the good way,\nbut rather the way in which it was first\nintended) by way of a rather graphic\ndescription of one of my less favourite\nsexual practices: felching. [Ed note: see\nurbandictionary.com]\nHe then goes on to fondly reminisce\nabout the times spent luring women\ninto his car, alluding to Lindsay LoFlat Sharp\nhan (whom he affectionately refers to\nas a c*nt) and Britney Spears, in Same\nSong & Dance, the title referring to the\nstruggle they put up as he gags them to\nfacilitate what you can probably guess\nwill follow. This track serves to remind\nus that he still obtains an extremely\nvivid imagination and ability for just as\nvivid story telling (or so we hope).\nThen comes my favourite part of the\nalbum, the second single, We Made\nYou, or rather the backing vocals it\ncontains, beautifully supplied by soul\nsinger Charmagne Tripp. Which helps\nbreak up the monotony of a weak,\npop-culture reference soaked pop\nsong, which at times sounds like it was\nmade with a mind on it\u2019s music video\nprospects.\nEventually we arrive at a song that\nI was expecting (but not hoping for)\nmore of in the album, a heartfelt retelling of his gradual demise to prescription medication. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is scattered\nwith excuses and lies that he makes\nin order to convince himself he needs\nto take the pills he\u2019s taking and paints\na lucid picture of the course an addict\u2019s mind takes on it\u2019s way down, not\ntypical Eminem, but a decent track\nnonetheless.\nTowards the end of the CD you begin\nto miss the old Eminem, why\u2019s he trying to sing? Why\u2019s he putting on these\nshitty voices? Until you reach the 20th\ntrack of this 20 track album, Underground. He\u2019s back! The same, aggres-sive, flowing, dark Eminem we\u2019ve been\nfamiliar with for so many years. Why\ndid he have to leave it until the very\nend before he re-emerged?\nYou would expect the music behind\nthe lyrics to be pretty good considering\nit\u2019s an entirely Dr. Dre production, and\nnothing less should be expected from a\nmusic producer who has a PhD in exactly that (Haha).\nAnd yeah, they\u2019re alright, not up to\nwhat I was expecting, but by any normal standards they certainly raise the\nquality of the album above that based\non the other components alone. However we aren\u2019t concerned with normal\nstandards here. What I was expecting\nwas one of the longest running producers in this genre to make something special, and he hasn\u2019t, which is\ndisappointing.\nThat\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s all crap, by\nno means is that the case, there are still\n2 or 3 tracks that boast his talent, one\nthat stands out especially being: Old\nTimes Sake, which reeks of old Dr Dre\nand Eminem when they were at the top\nof their collaborative game and it\u2019s a\nshame that hasn\u2019t seeped into the rest\nof the album.\nAs I listen, I can\u2019t help but think: Dr\nDre has an album of his own due out\nthis year, he would have made plenty of\nbeats for it, obviously kept the best of\nthem for himself, but what to do with\nthose that are usable but not quite up\nto high standard? Use them for a collaborating artist\u2019s album also coming\nout soon? Maybe.\nSo what I am I saying? I certainly\nwouldn\u2019t spend money on it, but it\u2019s\ndefinitely worth a free download and a\nlisten every now and then if only just\nfor the entertainment that his humorous lyrics have to offer as it should still\nbe appreciated that there are few artists around to stretch the boundaries\nanywhere near to the extent of Marshall Mathers.\nSo yes, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s back, I just wish\nhe came back the way he left. In one\nof the interludes (Steve Berman, skit)\na brief reference is made to him having made 2 albums during his time\nout, if that bares any truth at all, I just\nwonder\u2026\nEminem\nRelapse\nInterscope\nHHIII\nStag & Dagger is a music event where\nlots of exciting new bands get together and all play on one day, in one\ncity. So you buy a wristband in the\nearly evening and stagger around from\nvenue to venue trying to catch as many\nbands as possible as you get progressively beered up before crashing on a\nsofa in the small hours of the morning\nat the final venue where electro DJs try\nto keep you dancing.\nI went up to t\u2019north to the Leeds one,\nbut it also takes place in London and\nGlasgow every year. The wonderful\nthing is that for the price it would cost\nto see one band, you can see several,\nand be exposed perhaps to new bands\nyou wouldn\u2019t have chosen to see when\nthey play on their own. In turn, the\nbands get people coming to see them\nlive who perhaps wouldn\u2019t have heard\nof them before and may become fans.\nIt\u2019s a bit like the Camden Crawl but\nwith equally good bands for half the\nprice. Heres a review of each band I\nchose to see, but I missed out on some\namazing bands such as the Mae Shi,\nTwilight Sad, White Denim, and the\nManhattan Love Suicides because of\ntime clashes.\nAbe Vigoda 7:30pm\nThe venue was packed to see this band,\nas they were the most high profile band\nplaying this early and no doubt everyone wanted to check out if they live up\nto the hype they\u2019ve been getting from\nnumerous music publications. They\nplay a kind of hypnotic surf-punk a little like if Wavves was fueled\nwith alcohol instead of\nmarijuana.\nTheir music probably tries\nto capture the lazy boredom and frustration of\ntheir homeland, California. To my ears, it\u2019s some\nkind of tropical blend of\nambient backgrounds\nand punk rhythms. I\nwas pretty excited to\nsee them because I\u2019ve\nbeen enjoying their\nalbum, Skeleton, for a\nwhile now. Live they\nlose some of their\nsurf-y echo replacing\nit with louder more\nchaotic noisiness,\nbut they definitely\ndon\u2019t disappoint.\nCrystal Antlers 8:30pm\nI didn\u2019t know anything\nabout this band before I\nsaw them and I was planning on going to see King\nCreosote instead, but\nonce they took to the\nstage I was transfixed\n(and also had most of a\npint to finish).\nTheir music sounds\nlike psychadelic garage\nrock with howling vocals and one crazy guy\nwho just bashes the\nhell out of various percussion\ninstruments with the energy\nof a madman. I have since\ngone home and tried to listen to them on record but it\njust isn\u2019t as good as the live\nexperience.\nVivian Girls 9:50pm\nMy review of Vivian Girls was, I think, the second thing I wrote for\nthe felix last year when I was annoyed that felix was mostly covering\nbands like Coldplay and Keene which anyone with ears is already\nbored to tears with. Brooklyn\u2019s coolest ladies were just as good this\ntime, if not better.\nHowever that might just be because I\u2019m more familiar with their\nmusic now so it\u2019s even catchier and cuter than before. I still think\nthey\u2019re glorious. Unfortunately I spent most of the set waiting in\nthe queue for the bar, but I can tell you they sound just\nas good when you are facing away from\nthem.\nTelepathe 10:50pm\nI still haven\u2019t worked out how\nTelepathe is supposed to be pronounced despite asking several\npeople, \u201cIs it telepath/telepathy/\ntele-pathy?\u201d there didn\u2019t seem to\nbe any consensus on the matter.\nTelepathe are two girls in mens\u2019 t-shirts with lots of keyboards, and\nthey were amazing. If you haven\u2019t\nheard of Telepathe, I can guarantee you will pretty soon when they get\nscooped up by mainstream newspaper\njournalists who like to tell squares what\u2019s\nhip.\nI would describe them as\nelectro-pop but that would\nmake you think of music like\nLittle Boots and they couldn\u2019t\nbe further from that sort of contrived lowest-common-denomi-nator rubbish.\nCursive 11:50pm\nWhen I got to this venue there was\nalready a crowd of scrawny boys\nwith emo haircuts and moshing\ntendencies surrounding the stage,\nbut no-one should let this put them\noff a band as enjoyable as Cursive.\nYes, their music is the sort of American indie punk that appeals to the\nteenager within you, but don\u2019t feel bad\nabout it! I think that perhaps for some of us, watching this band\nwas a bit of a guilty pleasure, but we revelled in it, dancing and singing along.\nThe highlight was when they played an only just recognisable cover of Beyonce\u2019s \u201cSingle ladies\u201d, showing that this is a band that doesn\u2019t\ntake itself seriously, unlike the majority of slightly emo indie bands\nmade up of middle-aged men.\nCW: So its been four years since\nyour last record \u2018Live It Out\u2019 does\nthe way your new album \u2018Fantasies\u2019 was written greatly differ?\nJS: It was different in the sense that\nwe sort of started more from scratch\nthan we\u2019ve ever started before. When\nwe made \u2018Live it Out\u2019 we had been\ntouring for like three years straight on\n\u2018Old World Underground\u2019, writing as\nwe were going. \u2018Live it Out\u2019 it was just\nkind of a representation of what we\nhad been doing on tour for so long so\nwhen we got back together to start the\nprocess of writing and recording the\nnew record, it was more like us designing what we wanted to sound like for\nthe future than representing what we\nalready started to sound like.\nCW: I imagine you were pretty\nfrustrated when your record\nleaked on the internet?\nJS: We respond by streaming the album in its entirety the same day, and\nyou know what, it feels like it\u2019s only\nhelped. I know that statistically illegal\nfile sharing, but I don\u2019t feel like it hurts\nus. I mean I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s right. I feel\nlike if I were going down the street and\nsee a front door open, I\u2019m not going to\ngo in and nick their toaster. If I was,\nthen I guess I would be OK with stealing music too. People hide behind their\ncomputers in a lot of ways. If you\u2019re a\nthief, go on and steal your music but\nif you\u2019re a great person and you don\u2019t\nsteal anything else ever, I\u2019m not totally\nsure why you would steal music.\nCW: So what do you have to do\nto try and keep an album under\nwraps and not leak before its\nrelease?\nJW: We finished our record and sat\non it for six months. It only started\nleaking only when we sent it out to\nthe industry, which is really ironic because it\u2019s the industry who are always\ncomplaining that they don\u2019t have any\njobs anymore. But where do the leaks\ncome from? I mean for me musically,\nthe only real downside is that I\u2019ve\nspent a couple of years of my life trying to make that record as good as it\ncan possibly be and every single sonic\nlittle quality has a lot to do with that. If\nsomeone gets an [illegally] downloaded copy, I don\u2019t know what that sounds\nlike. It kind of makes me feel like all the\nenergy that I may have put into these\nsongs and their production has all kind\nof been futile, because there could be\nsomeone blog reviewing the wrong\nversion of the song. Everyone now just\ndreams about making a million dollars\noff their blog, but try not to use my\nmusic to make that happen.\nCW: I\u2019ve heard Broken Social\nScene are working on a new\nalbum, can we expect any metric\ninvolvement?\nJS: I hope so, it just all depends on the\ntimings of it all.\nCW: Do you think the break, with\neveryone\u2019s solo stuff has enriched\nthe band?\nJS: Yeah I think so; a band is like some\nsort of weird medium between mar-riage, and family. You have to stay really committed to both the idea and the\npeople, what really helps that commitment lasts is that you constantly make\nthe decision to be part of it, and when\nthe band gives you freedom it makes\nit a lot easier. I think the fact that we\nexercised some freedom really helped\neveryone come back with fresh ears\nand a fresh mind, and we don\u2019t have\nthe idea that we\u2019re stuck together.\nCW: The production of fantasies\nsounds a lot bigger, and perhaps\nmore polished, contrasting with\nthe raw feel of \u2018Live it Out\u2019. Was\nthat a conscious decision dictated\nby the new direction in sound?\nJS: We tried a lot of different sounds\nand production ideas until what felt\ncomfortable made itself apparent. The\nalbum is probably more influenced by\nthe last chapter of 2001 than any band\nor record, we watched that a lot. \u2018Jupiter and beyond the infinite\u2019 I think it\u2019s\ncalled. It\u2019s more imagery like that than\nlike preferential sound.\nCW: You put this record out your-self. Is that because you don\u2019t feel\nsatisfied with working with major\nlabels?\nJS: In my experience major labels have\none way of working, and if you happens\nto be one of the 300 bands that it works\nfor, great. If you aren\u2019t, then you\u2019re going to get fucked. The record companies all know that they\u2019re fucked too,\nbut I don\u2019t feel that way about music,\nI feel more optimistic about my own\nChristopher Walmsley interviews Jimmy Shaw, guitarist from the Canadian indie rock band Metric...\nApologies, Tytus\nThe review we published last week of Fleet Foxes\nwas not by Victoria Brzezinski as was printed, but\nby Tytus Murphy. Sorry, Tytus! We can\u2019t change\nwhat\u2019s already printed but we hope you appreciate a\nprinted apology.

It has been confirmed\nCollege plan to reduce the Languages\nundergraduate provision by 60%, with\nfour languages courses at all ability\nlevels being abolished entirely. The remaining languages will only be offered\nas higher ability-level classes. Furthermore, four non-language courses are\nalso to be discontinued.\nThe news broke late last week; simultaneously from two outlets. Friday\u2019s\nrelease of last week\u2019s felix coincided\nwith a mass email sent out collectively\nby the staff members of the Humanities Department. The Felix article\nwas in response to a recently-passed\npaper from Senate, the College\u2019s top decision-making body,\nwhich outlined and reasoned the\nproposed decreases in Humanities provision from next year. A Staff\nConsultation Paper was also issued\nto lecturers and teachers within the\nHumanities Department earlier that\nweek. The paper effectively told them\nof the many jobs at risk within their\ndepartment as a result of the cuts.\nIn an incensed response, they decided to leak the information telling of the proposed course cuts via\na mass email to all students who are\ncurrently, or have previously stud-ied, a language at Imperial. Their\nemail urged students to \u201cmake [their]\nviews known\u201d in order to \u2018preserve\nthe Language Programme for [them]\nselves and future students.\u201d\nA further statement from the Languages staff has been made since.\nWhat exactly is being cut from the Humanities programme?\n\u2022 Russian, Arabic, Japanese, and Italian daytime language courses at all levels of ability.\n\u2022 All \u2018Beginner\u2019 levels, equivalent to GCSE standard and below, generally termed \u2018Level 1 & 2\u2019 in\nthe remaining languages, with Mandarin an exception (Mandarin Level 1 and 2 cuts to be under\nreview the following year).\n\u2022 These language courses will be reduced from current three to two hours a week of teaching time.\n\u2022 Four non-language courses; Art in the 20th Century, Modern Literature and Drama, Film Studies,\nand Roman Empire\nWhy is College cutting Humanities courses?\n\u2022 Contrary to what was first thought, the Humanities Department is not suffering entirely because\nof newly acquired budgetary constraints placed across all departments in College, though in an\nofficial statement, College do describe their proposals to bring \u201clong term stability in very challenging financial circumstances\u201d.\n\u2022 The official line, according to the Review of Humanities compiled by the Strategic Education\nCommittee, is that the course cuts are a \u201crefocusing of direction\u201d the department is taking. This is\nto \u201cbring it into line with the strategic aims of College.\u201d\n\u2022 An official College statement claimed that \u201cmany options having grown up in response to sporadic demand rather than a clear strategy and need.\u201d\n\u2022 College also comments on the issue of lower ability language classes, saying \u201cthe [Strategic\nEducation] Committee found that the breadth and level of language provision was too broad and\nagreed that it was inappropriate for the College to continue to teach languages at GCSE level or\nbelow as part of degree programmes.\u201d\n\u2022 The non-language courses being cut as daytime choices to undergraduates are \u201cones least in line\nwith the strategic goals of the College and the least popular with students.\u201d Remaining courses\nare to be taught with the view of providing students with \u201ctransferable skills\u201d.\nWhat are College\u2019s \u201cstrategic aims\u201d?\n\u2022 The College want us, the students, to be trained in the ethics of our respective disciplines\nand science communication. They also wish students to have a broad understanding of the history of subjects we undertake as part of our degrees, stating the above are a \u201cvital part of scientific life\u201d. Basically, courses that are largely irrelevant to students\u2019 chosen degree streams are to\nbe severely limited as optional evening hobbies, rather than degree-credited modules.\n\u2022 College state that \u201csome employers have suggested that Imperial graduates would be even more\ncompetitive in the jobs market if they demonstrated stronger communications skills.\u201d\nFinalists battle it\nout for Summer\nBall prize\nT\nhe Battle for the Ball\ncomes to a close tonight in\ndBs from 19:00 onwards.\nThe competition has\nrun for the last three\nweeks, picking out the cream of the\nImperial crop, separating the musical\nchaff from the wheat, choosing Imperial\u2019s ripest artistic fruit, to give one\nlucky band the chance to open for Athlete at the Summer Ball.\nRock-pop band Cosmo Jones won\nthe first heat with relative ease, seeing\noff Free Yard Jam and Arun Rao (who\nwasn\u2019t actually available for the ball in\nany case).\nThe second heat was won by Jimmy\nand the Banned in a Gillette-Mach\n3-razor-close contest with the ridiculously entertaining, far-out experimental rock band Kensington Gore. Nick\nRead, Jimmy and the Banned\u2019s bassist\nalso won the unofficial prize for \u201cBest\nRocking Out by a Bass Guitarist\u201d.\nThe final heat was taken by \u201cWe Play\nParties\u201d, in only their second gig as a\nband. On the same night, Sharp Noir\n(painfully cool blues group; you make\nyour own decision about the name) delivered a strong set to clinch the wildcard prize, securing their place as one\nof the four bands in tonight\u2019s final.\nVoting will be open to anybody who\nattends so the winner may come down\nwho can drag the most friends down\nthe gig. In any case, it\u2019s a Friday, take\na break from revision and clear your\nhead with music from Imperial\u2019s finest.\nThe medical school\u2019s election results\nwere announced at the Reynolds Bar\nlast Friday.\nAfter weeks of intense campaigning,\nthe endless treadmill of lecture shout-outs, Facebook groups and poorly\nphotoshopped posters finally came to\nan end at the \u2018results bop\u2019. Calling it a\n\u2018bop\u2019 was perhaps a little strong considering the turnout, but this wasn\u2019t\nsurprising considering that we are now\napproaching the climax of exam sea-son. While the support at this bop was\na little weak, the support at the voting\npolls certainly was not. An impressive\n45% of medical students voted in these\nelections and this was despite the fact\nthat 9 of the 16 positions were only\ncontested by one person.\nThe reason these figures are impressive not because more than half of\nmedical students didn\u2019t vote, but because in comparison to the central unions\u2019 and other faculty union elections\nthis actually is a pretty good turnout.\nMost other elections at Imperial struggle to get even 25% of their students to\nvote.\nThe unions\u2019 are student run organisations which look out for student in-terests, the people who run them have\nan important role in campus life. So\nwhen someone chooses not to vote it\nshows that they don\u2019t feel like the union is relevant to them and that they\nreally couldn\u2019t care less who runs it.\nThis reporter feels that if three quarters of IC students feel this, then it is a\nsad state of affairs and one that needs\nto be addressed.\nThe medical students on the other\nhand obviously feel a greater sense\nAs last week\u2019s article sparks massive student furore, News Editor Dan Wan, investigates further into the\never-expanding fiasco which surrounds the proposed cuts in Imperial\u2019s Humanities programme\nof ownership and belonging for their\nunion that has led to this higher par-ticipation. They care about their union\nand, despite the lack of competition\nfor many of the positions this year,\ncontinued to vote. If ICU ever wants to\nimprove its turnout, perhaps it should\nlook towards the medical school for\ninspiration.\nEven though the Medical elections\nare over, there are still a few central union elections that need to be complet-ed. Voting for ICU Council Chair and\nother council seats opens today (Friday\n29th May) so make sure to go to impe-rialcollegeunion.org to cast your vote.\nAs well as the ICU Council positions,\nvoting is also open for the Graduate\nSchools Association positions, how-ever, there are a few positions that are\nvacant and might require a second vote\nin October. Voting closes for all positions on 2nd June with the results announced soon after.\nAnil Chopra, who felix interviewed earlier this month, was elected as\nthe new ICSMSU President\ncontinued on page 4\nLetters to felix\nSince last week\u2019s felix article, letters have been sent to our editors. Each conveys a similar\nconcern with regards to the cuts in language provision. They are from a variety of individuals\nacross the student body, including an ex-ERASMUS student worried that the trimming of language\ncourses will prevent future students from gaining valuable and life-changing experiences as part of the\nsame scheme. For the full selection of letters, flick to Letters to the Editor on page 6.\nGeneral consensus amongst the student body\nfelix ventured out across campus, and asked wandering students for their opinions on the now well-publicised cutback in humanities courses. 100% of students asked responded negatively, with some even\nlaying into College.\n\u201cI think that cutting something as beloved by students as the language courses, with reasons that are flimsy\nat best, will be detrimental to the university\u2019s overall quality and a grave disservice to current and future\nstudents. I\u2019m extremely disappointed in the university for making this decision.\n\u201d \u2013 Louis Constant\n\u201cAt best, cutting humanities won\u2019t do anything to help the geekdom at Imperial. At worst, it\u2019ll affect personal growth and employment opportunities. \u2013 Sanjay Choolun\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether learning something like Japanese would improve my employability, and it may not\nmatter hugely to my future prospects, but I didn\u2019t come to university just for my prospects, I came to broaden my horizons and do new things so I\u2019m all against the cuts.\n\u201d \u2013 Stefan Piatek\nIf Imperial students need one thing during this recession, it is a good broad education. Driving students\ndown narrower and narrower pathways does nothing other than reduce their employment prospects.\n\u201d\n\u2013 Ian Swords\nSTUDENT RESPONSE\n\u201cIt is a real blow to lose some of our most popular and long-est-running courses. Hundreds of students who have already\nindicated their preferences face disappointment as courses are\nwithdrawn. They allow students to explore a rich cultural context which they might not otherwise have an opportunity to expe-rience. If Imperial graduates are to compete for jobs, they have to\nshow that they bring something extra. It is very sad to see opportunities for students to enhance their CVs being reduced rather\nthan expanded.\u201d\nGRISKIN DAY,\nNON-LANGUAGES COORDINATOR\n\u201cWe are deeply sympathetic towards the student body at Imperial. The\nchoice of languages to be retained as credit courses and those to be cut seems\nquite at variance with the requirement for scientist and engineers to operate\nin an increasingly global context. In addition, reducing the day courses from\nthree hours to two per week must lead to lower standards.\nThe Strategic Education Committee\u2019s report concludes that it is necessary\nto bring the direction of the Department \u2018into line with the strategic aims\nof the College\u2019. If this is understood to imply that the Languages Programme\nis considered not to be in accord with these aims, this view is strikingly at\nodds with the recommendations of the UK\u2019s most prestigious scientific institutions that all engineers and scientists should be encouraged to study a\nforeign language.\nIt is particularly unfortunate that none of the cuts were ever discussed with\nthe languages staff.\n\u201d\nLANGUAGES STAFF STATEMENT\n\u201cI expected that there would be considerable discontent from the\nstudent body in response to the Humanities review, but I did not\nanticipate that it would strike a nerve with so many students. However, students have to understand the considerable impact Higher\nEducation funding cuts, which are out of Imperial\u2019s control, are going to have on some aspects of teaching at Imperial. Something has\nto give as a result, and unfortunately languages has had to suffer\nsignificantly. I will work with members of College to see if we can\nreach a solution which will be the best compromise for all.\n\u201d\nHANNAH THEODOROU,\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nCOLLEGE CLAIM LESS IS MORE. IS IT?\nJimmy and the Banned will be in the final tonight!\n\n"

The\nteam met at the tube station with the\nnotable absence of next year\u2019s secretary\nRohan, who decided he\u2019d show everyone how responsible he was by turning\nup over an hour late (even though he\nhad been rang an hour earlier to make\nsure he was playing) and offering no\nexcuse for this, although it must be\nmentioned that his hair looked extra\nshiny on this occasion.\nPlay started in glorious sunshine\nwith London Met batting first and\nout came two rather large batters who\nproceeded to throw the bat at every-thing. Both players managed to hit a\nfew boundaries before giving a wicket\nto each of the opening bowlers Navin\nand Sri. Upon getting the 2nd wicket\nRohan showed his worth the team by\nsaying \u201cwe\u2019re into the tail now lads\u201d, to\nthe no 4 batter who went onto to become London Met\u2019s top scorer with 60.\nAfter a couple of wickets had fallen to\nAndy and Pete, Sri returned to remove\nthe top scorer and trigger a London\nMet Collapse to 160 all out (which was\nless than they got against IC 1s) with\nSri taking 5 wickets in an excellent\nperformance.\nBuoyed by his bowling performance Sri came out to open the batting\nalong with Adnan and they both made\na mockery of the bowling and raced\nto 40 runs between them before London Metgate 2 occurred. The players\nclaiming the ball had become misshapen swapped the new ball for an old dog\nball. Soon after attempting the same\nshot as he played many times with the\nnew ball Sri was caught out as the ball\nlooped to the player at mid-on. This\ntriggered an extremely disappointing\nIC collapse with only Shiraz and Mat\nTarr making decent scores. In this\noverall disappointing performance the\n\u201cThanks for coming award\u201d goes to Rohan who turned up late, said the worst\nsledge of the day and topped it off with\ngetting a golden duck.

It does this with a much higher\nefficiency than conventional methods\nthat rely on the burning of the fuel as\nseen in internal combustion engines\nfound in most of the cars you see driving around. However, the main attraction of this technology is that it has the\nBilly Wu potential to be completely zero-emis-sion; the only by-product of a fuel cell\nis water!\nRacing Green has already successfully produced two go-kart sized ve-hicles, the IRG01 and the IRG02, the\nlatter of which raced in the Formula\nZero Championship. Formula Zero is\nthe world\u2019s first race series to feature\nonly zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell\nvehicles and featured 6 teams from\naround the world. Last summer IRG02\nwent to the opening race of the series\nin Rotterdam and eventually finished,\ncontroversially, in 3rd place, with the\nformat of the event working against\nthe Imperial team.\nThe IRG02 features an 8kW Hydrogenics fuel cell and a supercapacitor\nsystem which provides power to two\nDespite barely playing this season, most of the lads still remembered to bring their cricket attire\n\n"

After months\n(minutes) of investigation the Hangman team\nhas made a shocking discovery that will likely (or\nnot at all) shake the Union to its very\ncore. The Union Finance Offices, situated in the North-East corner of Beit\nQuad, are currently hosting a black\nhole.\nThe body, first hypothised in 1783\nis at the time of writing three metres\nin diameter and growing fast. Sir Robert Pinkelson, Head of Black Hole research in the Geology Department has\nlabelled the discovery \u2018astonishing\u2019.\n\u201cThe Pinkelson black hole is the first\nblack hole of its size to be discovered on\nEarth. From an experimental point of\nview, it could offer a ton of information\nbefore it destroys the Earth completely,\nexterminating mankind with it.\u201d\nThe news has come as a shock to\nUnion finance staff but some have expressed relief, Miss Tyworth had this\nto say: \u201cStuff kept going missing, in-voices, cheques, payment slips, it was\nall very embarrassing. But now obviously there\u2019s an explanation, it was the\nTyworth black hole all along!\u201d\nThe future remains uncertain for\nstaff in the Finance Office. Union\nPresident Jenny Morgan has refused to\ngive the staff leave while the black hole\ncrisis is addressed and due to a lack of\nspace in the Union, has been unable\nto move the finance office elsewhere,\n\u201cThere simply isn\u2019t anywhere to put\nthem and the Union finance work can\u2019t\nsimply grind to a halt. I don\u2019t mean to\nbe unkind, but they\u2019ll have to put up\nwith the Morgan black hole until a better solution can be devised.\u201d\nThe College have seized on this discovery as another reason for the Union\nto hand over the running of it\u2019s financ-es, to the College Finance Department.\nThe Head of the College Finance Department, Baron Von Steam-a-lot, had\nthis to say to Hangman. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious\nthat the Union can\u2019t keep a hold of\nit\u2019s finances. They aren\u2019t efficient at\nprocessing payments, they can\u2019t keep\na track of what money has gone where\nand as this latest depacle highlights,\ntheir finances are full of black holes!\nI\u2019m just glad the Steam-a-lot black hole\nwas spotted so quickly before more\ndamage could be done!\u201d\nAs the argument ensues the black\nhole continues to grow at an alarming\nrate, with no valid solutions at present.\nHangman\u2019s correspondent at CERN\nhas told us that scientists there are\nprivately pleased about the black hole,\nwith one commenting, \u201cI told you it\nwouldn\u2019t be us!!!\u201d\n(At least if the world ended, I wouldn\u2019t\nhave to stay up all night de-shitifying\nyour page Hangman! -Ed)\nThe black hole has made going for lunch just that little bit harder\nIn wake of catering scandal, douchebag felix\nreporters... still eat at Union\nA\nllegedly... Last week, the\nfelix news team (tossers)\nissued a damning verdict\non the state of catering in\nthe Union. They showed\nthat most students were unhappy with\nthe quality of food and the quality of\nservice; skillfully delivering their message with the question \u201cWould you eat\nfrom this?\u201d.\nThe Hangman team isn\u2019t sure how\nmost students responded to this question (or whether they asked \u201cNo, who\nthe fuck eats out of a chip fryer?\u201d) but\nwe do know how the felix news team\n(tossers) answered.\nJovan Nedic (Editor-in-Little Chef),\nKadhim Shubber (Who shot the\nDeputy Editor) and Dan Wan (Editor-erect) have all been spotted eating at\nthe Union since their \u2018bold\u2019 expose of\nthe Union\u2019s catering. The Hangman\u2019s\n\u2018food-from-a-distance\u2019 expert told\nus that they enjoyed a slightly over\nImperial\u2019s\napartheid regime\nunder attack\nA\nllegedly... In a stunning\nblow to the credibility\nof the apartheid regime\nat Imperial College London, Labour MP Diane\nAbbott has sparked a fresh debate on\nthe science university\u2019s policy of discriminating against black and minority\nstudents.\nAt a Westminster Hall debate on\nthe 20th of May, Ms Abbott (Winner\nof the Spectator Speech award 2008),\nbravely declared (or might not have)\nthat \u201cthere is an unspoken apartheid at\nImperial, as a member of this House,\nmy conscience cannot let this injustice\nremain unspoken any longer!\u201d\nHangman\u2019s Parliamentary affairs\ncorrespondent (co-conspirator) said\nthat the House rose to triumphant\napplause, with one MP commenting,\n\u201cTears swelled up in my eyes, possibly\nthe most emotive speech given in this\nHouse\u2019s history.\u201d\nHer comments were less warmly recieved at Imperial College, where the\nRector, Sir Roy Anderson, is reported\nto have dropped his monocle into his\ntea on hearing the news.\nIn a formal statement, after his famous temper had subsided, Sir Roy\ncalled Ms Abbott\u2019s speech \u201cA careless\nand dishonest slander on the reputation of Imperial College.\u201d He rejected\nthe label \u2018apartheid\u2019 and blamed (or he\nmight not have) the smallness of Imperial\u2019s black population on the failure\nof black applicants to meet Imperial\u2019s\nentry requirements, citing the work of\nbiologist James D. Watson.\nInspired by Ms Abbott\u2019s speech,\nprotestors have begun to congregate\noutside the Houses of Parliament,\npledging to remain until the government cuts its links with Imperial. Joining, among others, the Tamil protestors already there, this move looks\ncertain to make Parliament Square the\nmost densely populated area on Earth.\nDan Wan you naughty boy,\nput the archives down!\n29\nFriday 29 May 2009 felix\ndone chicken and chips dish with two\nsachets of salt but on Tuesday they\nchowed down on half a plate of pasta\nbolognaise that was three days off; no\nsalt was used.\nSee if you can spot Hangman and Angry Geek having a pint!\n\n"

    "content": "10 felix Friday 29 May 2009\nI\nmperial College graduate Jan\nJananayagam is running in the\nforthcoming European Parliament Elections as an independent candidate. felix caught up\nwith her to find out why she claims to\nstand out.\nBriefly what do you stand for?\nI stand for strong civil rights and\nagainst the erosion of the freedom of\nindividuals and communities. I stand\nfor financial transparency and better\nregulation in areas from MEP\u2019s expenses to the management of investments and pensions.\nI oppose the lack of transparency of\ninternational institutions such as the\nIMF, which uses taxpayers\u2019 money to\nprop up failing governments and econ-omies. I have already helped to bring\na legal injunction to prevent the IMF\nfrom lending to a recipient country\nthat would have used the funds to buy\nweapons of war and to commit crimes\nagainst humanity and/or genocide. I\nstand for small businesses and entre-preneurship, having run a small business myself; I know what is important\nto encourage entrepreneurship. I stand\nfor an ethical foreign policy. I stand for\nequality and diversity.\nWhy are you standing as an independent candidate?\nI want freedom in formulating policies and do not want to feel obliged\nto vote with the party line if I disagree\nwith an issue. Anyway, I do not feel I fit\ninto a particular party with the strong\ncivil rights issues I believe in and being\nbusiness friendly.\nI also feel in many ways that I am a\nprotest candidate, protesting against\ninjustice in Palestine, Tibet, Tamil\nEelam and Kurdistan. Protesting\nagainst the lack of action in the discrimination faced by communities in\nthese areas. If I was a candidate in a\nparty, this message of protest might\nnot be heard as loudly.\nWhy should people be interested\nin your campaign?\nMy campaign is different to the other\ncandidates as it is primarily, civil rights\norientated.\nIn the last few months, I and many\ntens of thousands of others have tried\nto influence the British government\nand main political parties to do something tangible to stop the war in Sri\nLanka. But we were unable to stop the\nforced starvation and aerial bombing\nof an entire people.\nI know how hard it has been to meet\nforeign ministers to lobby for action\nand the difficulty faced to change policies even when the policy is wrong in\nthe first place.\nThis has led many to campaign\nagainst the system, challenge current\nforeign policy and yearn for change.\nWith some of the other parties, the\ncandidates are seasoned MEPs, will\nthey bring about the changes that is\nneeded, something that has been elu-sive, thus far? As a human rights ac-tivist, I have the background to shake\nthings around.\nPeople are also worried about the\nBNP and with MP sleaze affecting the\nmain parties, focus has turned to the\nsmaller parties and independent candidates as a protest vote, as an alternate to the BNP.\nWhat gives you the experience to\nbe an MEP?\nA few years ago, my company sued\nthe Commonwealth Secretariat for\nexpropriating the ownership of my\ncompany\u2019s e-commerce software. Due\nto diplomatic immunity granted to the\nSecretariat under the Commonwealth\nSecretariat Act, meant that there was\nno initial access to the UK courts.\nAs a result I was forced to take the\nmatter to an internal tribunal set up\nby the Commonwealth, all of whose\njurists were appointed by the Commonwealth Secretary General. Unsurprisingly the Commonwealth jurists\nruled in favour of the Commonwealth\nSecretariat.\nI appealed this decision at the Royal\nCourts of Justice arguing that the internal rules of the Commonwealth\nSecretariat, which prevented appeal\nto the UK courts, combined with\nthe Commonwealth Secretariat Act,\nwhich granted immunity to the Commonwealth Secretariat violated the\nEuropean Human Rights Act on two\ncounts \u2013 the right to an independent\nand impartial court and the peaceful\nenjoyment of my company\u2019s property\nto have been violated by the Commonwealth Secretariat. The judge at the\nappeal ruled in favour of my company\nand condemned the Commonwealth\nSecretariat.\nThis episode gave me confidence to\nspeak out against injustice \u2013 if I am\nable to successfully take on an intergovernmental organisation of many\nindependent member states, like the\nCommonwealth Secretariat, then I am\nnot afraid to speak out and take action\nagainst single governments or anyone\nelse.\nAs an MEP, I will not be afraid to\nspeak the truth. I will challenge unethical policies and fight for the voiceless.\nHow did your time at Imperial\nCollege shaped your views?\nIt was whilst I was at Imperial that my\nhuman rights activism had started. At\nthe time, the Government of Sri Lanka\nhad begun a policy of \u2018war for peace\u2019,\nwhich resulted in the death of many innocent civilians due to heavy shelling\nand aerial attacks.

Pretty simple really.\nImperial alumna running for European seat\nEurope or bust!\nSameer Bahal\n& Kajann Prathapan\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm\nFilm Editors \u2013 Zuzanna Blaszczak and Jonathan Dakin\n11\nFriday 29 May 2009 felix\nFor a movie called Fighting, there is\nvery little fighting in it. Unless you take\ninto account the people in the cinema\nfighting their way out of the fire exit\nbecause of their uncontrollable need to\nescape the awfulness of this film.\nFighting is advertised as a \u2018sport\ndrama\u2019/action film in the vein of Rocky\nand Rambo. And that is what I, and\nevery other person in the cinema, expected to see. But unfortunately, this\nwas not a sporting drama, or an action\nfilm, or even a thriller; it was a social\ndrama with a few bare-knuckle fights\ninterspersed between scenes of the\n\u2018gritty\u2019 mean streets of New York and a\nsoppy love story.\nThe plot consists of a down-and-out\ntramp, played by Tatum, who stumbles\nupon a man who says he can help him\nearn money by fighting. And that is it.\nThe rest is one hour and forty minutes of character building, with three\ntwo-minute fights shoved in for good\nmeasure. That\u2019s right: three fights. It\njust doesn\u2019t make any sense. I know\nthat an action film must have some\nkind of plot, no matter how weak to\nhinge everything around it on, but\nthis didn\u2019t even have any action in it.\nOr a proper plot. And the character\nbuilding was not even very good - I\nam a big fan of Terence Howard, but\nI spent most of the film not knowing if\nhis character was meant to have learning disabilities or not (and I don\u2019t think\nhe knew either), which goes to show\nthat not even he was convinced by the\ntepid script. Tatum on the other hand\nis just there for eye candy: his acting\nconsists of pathetic puppy dog, angry\npuppy dog, vulnerable puppy dog, and\ncaring puppy dog. But let\u2019s be hon-est: he was only cast for his striking\ngood looks and well-chiselled body-something the women in the cinema\nmoaned with delight at every time he\ntook his top off (which happened extremely often). I on the other hand,\nnot being someone who fancies him,\njust wanted to see some beat-em-up\naction scenes, not drool over the main\nman, and that is probably why I really\ndidn\u2019t like it. There was a sexy lady for\nus straight men in the audience, but\nunless she was Eva Mendes hot (which\nshe wasn\u2019t), there was no way she was\ngoing to force any oestrogen into the\nsausage-fest testosterone filled environment that this film choked us with.\nShe didn\u2019t even get her breasts out \u2013\nsomething that I was very disappointed about, and may have given this film\nan extra star rating for if she had. We\nsaw his flesh the whole way through:\nwhy not see hers too? After all, it is\nonly fair to give us something to enjoy\nin a film this dire.\nAs I said before, the film is called\nFighting, but there isn\u2019t much of this\nat all. And when it does happen, it is\nslightly disturbing. I thought that the\nfighting in this film would be boxing\nor something, like Rocky, but instead\nit was bum fights replacing the bums\nwith Abercrombie and Fitch mod-els. They fight bare fisted, and they\nbeat each other to a pulp in front of\nwealthy businessmen spectators who\nare baying for blood. I doubt in these\ncredit crunch times Wall Street bankers could afford to pay the rent, let\nalone pay to see street fighters beat\neach other up. So the fighting, when\nit did happen, was brutal, with heads\nbeing smashed against walls and, um,\nheads being smashed against floors,\nand err, heads being pummelled into\nbloody pulps. So it wasn\u2019t \u2018legal\u2019 fight-ing, it was something you could watch\non You Tube if you were sick enough\nto want to see starving men (who look\nlike models) attack each other. They\nweren\u2019t cool fights like in most action\nfilms: they were just sadistic.\nPlease, I urge everyone considering\nwatching this film not to be fooled by\nthe name and the advertising. Unless\nyou want to see a \u2018deep\u2019 film about a\nrunaway hobo with daddy issues and\nanger problems, and let\u2019s not forget a\nschmaltzy heart of gold, then do not\nsee this. Fighting is only for people who\nwant to see one thing and one thing\nonly: Channing Tatum walking around\ntopless.\nThere really are worse things than revision\nZuzanna would give Fighting four stars just for this photo of Channing\nTatum, but Jonathan vehemently disagrees\nSo the guy has steel claws, it\u2019s not like he uses them or anything\nFor stress relief try action movies\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine\nHHHHK\nDirector: Gavin Hood\nWriter: David Benioff\nSkip Woods\nCast: Hugh Jackman,\n\tLiev Schreiber,\nDanny Houston\nEvery X-Men fan has waited for this\nmoment for a long time, and they\nhave finally been granted what they\nwanted: Wolverine solo! Everybody\u2019s\nfavourite mutant finally gets his own\nmovie: all about him! He is, after all,\nthe best character in the X-Men (you\ncan argue with me all you want, I\ndon\u2019t care), and was certainly the\nbest part about the X-Men trilogy\n(although I do love Halle Berry who\nshould hopefully have her own XMen film about her character Storm\nbeing made soon), mainly because the\ndynamic and enigmatic Hugh Jackman steals every scene he is in.\nWolverine\u2019s premise is that he is a\nmutant, he has a brother called Sabretooth (Schreiber) and they are\nsomehow almost immortal, and in a\nvery slick and stylish opening we see\nhow they have fought in every American war, enjoying the killing and destruction because it is the only thing\nthey know how to do well. Then we\ncome to the (almost) modern period,\nand Wolverine and Sabretooth join a\ngang of other mutants who go around\nattacking people until one day he discovers that his brother loves killing a\nlittle too much (dun dun dun!) and so\nquits. And then the rest of the film is\nabout how he gets his steel claws and\ntries to go hunt his brother down. The\nplot isn\u2019t too important, because as\nwe know what is going to happen (if\nyou have seen the first X-Men films\nthen you know how this one will end),\nwe just want to see how it happens.\nThe action begins and never stops,\nwith car chases, explosions, fighting\nand escaping, all the way through to\nthe action-packed but slightly confusing ending.\nThe ending is pretty spectacular\neven though it doesn\u2019t really make a\nwhole lot of sense, but it is an adrenaline filled pulse-pounding climax,\nwhich is unusually unique and different from other action films. I loved\nthe fact that the action was non-stop:\nit is about time that good action films\nmade a comeback. Luckily there isn\u2019t\ntoo much character development, as\nWolverine\u2019s character endears himself to us through screaming and\nfighting, but when he meets the woman who melts his iron heart, we do\nsee a more tender side to him, adding\ndepth to this savage beast.\nAll of the supporting cast are enjoyable to watch (although I have no\nidea why the man from the Black Eyed\nPeas is in it \u00ad\u2013 but at least he isn\u2019t too\nbad), with loads of X-Men characters\nmaking brief appearances (including\na special guest star!). Liev Schreiber\nis very good as Sabretooth, relishing\nevery second he has on screen, but\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine is Hugh\nJackman\u2019s show, and he is content\nto let everyone know that: thrashing\nand smashing his way through every\nmoment.\nI am very happy to say that Gambit,\nan X-Men favourite whom fans have\nbeen waiting to see for a long time,\nlives up to the hype surrounding his\ncharacter, and is pretty awesome, delivering everything you want and expect him to.\nI can see why people wouldn\u2019t like\nthis film. It is very much an all-action-not-much-plot type of movie, and if\nyou enjoyed X-Men 2 then I\u2019m not\nsure how much you would like this. I\ndo have to point out that as good as\nthe film is, there is a huge, glaringly\nobvious and unbelievably stupid plot\nhole that doesn\u2019t really make much\nsense at all, and instead of it being a\n\u2018twist\u2019 at the end, it is just confusing\nand deters you momentarily from the\nenjoyment (and by the way - stay until\nthe credits have rolled to see an additional ending). But other than that,\nthere aren\u2019t really any other criticisms\nI have for it: being an action movie\nand superhero movie fan I had a really great time and liked being involved\nin the pure spectacle of the whole\nthing. It is very unique for an action\nfilm, and so adds another dimension\nof vitality and freshness which means\nyou are never bored. But just because\nthe style of the film is original doesn\u2019t\nmean they don\u2019t avoid cringingly\npainful clich\u00e9 moments, usually involving Jackman screaming in angst.\nHugh Jackman and the rest of the\nMarvel team have really done well\nto make this a success, and with the\nnext X-Men Origins film coming out\nin a year or so I am waiting to see if\nMagneto can live up to Wolverine (I\ndoubt it!).\nThe only question I was left wondering as I left the cinema was when\nthe next Wolverine film is coming\nout: because if it is anything like this\none then I will be first in line to see it!\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nFighting HKKKK\nDirector: Dito Montiel\nWriter: Robert Munic\nDitto Montiel\nCast: Channing Tatum,\n\tTerrence Howard,\nZulay Henao\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nHugh Jackman and the team that produced X-Men treat their fans to a thrilling and utterly enjoyable film\n\n"

All were a\nwelcomed chance to explore other interests outside my field. It seems I am\nnot alone, as 900 students have already\njoined the protest group on facebook\ncalled \u201cSave the Languages\u201d, which I\nstarted on Sunday. Additionally 600\nstudents have signed an independently\norganized petition. Either the college\ndid not know about the strength of the\nstudent feeling on the matter, in which\ncase the system of student representation is not adequate, or they just didn\u2019t\ncare.\nEven in the retained lunchtime\ncourses, they propose to cut the teaching time from three to two hours a\nweek. To do the entire A2 French syllabus in a year on just two hours teaching a week seems ridiculous. This is\nexactly the same reason why evening\ncourses of an hour and a half a week\nare no substitute; students need more\nteaching and support: not less.\nAnother problem is the effect that\nthese cuts will have on the Erasmus\nprogram. For instance, cutting back\non beginners\u2019 Italian will effectively\nstop the exchange with Italy. Not many\nschools offer Italian and therefore students arriving at Imperial will not be at\nthe required level to start an advanced\ncourse. Whereas before it was possible\nto start a new language at Imperial,\nspend you\u2019re third year abroad and\ngraduate completely fluent, this would\nno longer be possible.\nWe understand that college have\ngiven three main reasons for cutting\nhumanities. Firstly, they are trying to\nmake the schedule more flexible by not\nhaving the constraint of a protected\ntwo hours lunch break for humanity\noptions. Secondly, the long term strategic aim of Imperial is to integrate\nscience communication and ethics as\ncompulsory courses into all degree\nprograms. Thirdly, some believe the\nbeginner language courses are too basic to contribute to an Imperial degree.\nI believe they are missing some really important points. Timetabling is\nno reason to cut 60% of the offered\ncourses there must be ways to free up\nsay Friday lunchtime, and work around\nit, or offer extended evening courses\nfor credit. As to the courses being too\nbasic, I completely disagree.\nMy experience is students score lower in humanities than in their main de-gree. Restricting the beginner courses\nto the first and second years, would\nalso mean they would count a minute\namount towards your final degree\nmark.\nI chose Imperial above other univer-sities, specifically to do the Erasmus\nprogram to Spain. Dredging up my\ndistant GCSE knowledge, I started at\nLevel two Spanish (a level they\u2019re planning to axe).\nI am not a natural linguist, so this\nwas not an easy course for me and I\ndevoted a lot of time to it struggling\nwith grammar, and lists and lists of\nvocabulary. In the exam I scored just\n40%. However it allowed me to spend\nlast year in Spain with a Solid State\nresearch group and now I am fluent\nin Spanish. This year abroad made my\ndegree and I know the same can be said\nfor nearly everyone else I\u2019ve known doing the program.\nThe very nature of Imperial as a\nuniversity devoted to science, engineering and medicine means that it\nneeds to offer ways for its students to\nfollow other interests. The humanities\ncourses allow students to spend some\nof their time devoted to other interests,\nsomething which with all the pressures\nat Imperial is a welcome change.\nOne final point, although the group\nis called \u201cSave the Languages\u201d, it is also\nintended to campaign for college to reconsider the other humanity courses\ncut. Please join our group and voice\nyour opinion on not just the language\ncuts, but also your thoughts on the\nother humanity courses.\nIf your with me and feel that college\nshould hold a proper consultation with\nthe students, then please come along to\nour protest Wednesday (3rd) at 12:00\non the Queen\u2019s Lawn where we will\nmarch to the faculty building to hand\nin petitions and wave flags. Many of us,\nincluding myself, have exams, but this\nis important for future students, so I\nhope you will join us!\nI\nt\u2019s dark when I leave the Halls.\nIt wraps another layer of secrecy\nabout my business.\nI must confess. Since the start\nof the year, I have been having\nan affair.\nIt started out small. I looked up\nwhen someone mentioned her name. I\ncaught sight of her in passing and she\nof me. I thought nothing of it. Until\nthat time in the night. I woke up in a\ncold sweat. This burning feeling in my\nchest; this compulsion that must sated.\nI knew I had to meet with her.\nDressing quickly, I set off. I had occasionally visited my paramour in the\nday, or even in the early evening if\nwe both felt that way inclined. It had\nbeen free, it had been easy; we had\nbeen comfortable. But not now. Now,\nI ached for her. I smiled secretly to\nmyself, thrilled with the thought of my\nnocturnal adventure.\nI found my way to her house. I say\nhouse \u2013 it more of a hostel, for her and\nthose like her. It\u2019s quiet now \u2013 so few\npeople around. This is where the fun\nbegins, the foreplay. Sometimes, she\u2019s\nthere, waiting for me on the ground\nfloor. Sometimes, she is spread out\nacross a table in anticipation. Sometimes, and these I love the most, I must\nseek her out, to toil after the reward.\nShe\u2019s coy but I know where to look.\nExperience has taught me of her hiding places, little nooks out of the way\nwhere she thinks I won\u2019t find her. But\nthen my eyes catch sight of her and I\nstop, and my heart stops with me.\nShe is beautiful, I can\u2019t deny, though\never-changing. Sometimes she is older\nthan me, sometimes merely a child.\nSometimes she is world-weary, other\ntimes she is fresh, ready for me. Sometimes she is rubenesque, sometimes\nshe is a size zero. But always, always\nbeautiful to me.\nI took her by her colourful cloth-ing, always something new for each\nvisit. I led her lovingly onwards, away\nfrom the prying eyes of others, jealous\nof what we have. I set her down gently and breathe in her scent. I knew it\nwon\u2019t be long now.\nWith sacred sanctity, I peeled back\nher outer garments and spread her before me. My eyes watered for the sight\nbefore me and I drank it in. My lover\ndidn\u2019t blush; she wasn\u2019t ashamed by\nwhat she had to show. My eyes pored\nover her details, every one an intimate\npart of her. I knew I cannot control\nmyself any longer.\nI reached into my trousers and removed my instrument, gripping it\ntightly save I spill. I looked to my lover,\nshe said nothing. She let me continue.\nWith the utmost delicacy, I began.\nMy love tells a story, and I must remember it. With my instrument, I\nmarked out her finest points, worthy\nfor eternity. Tattoos of passion, our\nlove is consummated. My eyes darted\nback and forth, and my hand moved\nfaster. She could barely take it all.\nThen we were done.\nGlancing around, I modestly redressed her. When that was done, my\nhand rested longingly over her but we\nboth knew that we had done enough\nfor one night. Now was the time for\nrest. Like a groom and his bride, I carried her back to her resting place. I returned home, content.\nSometimes, we escape together, for\nthe weekend, or the week, or longer\nstill. We play our games in new loca-tions, but the moves are the same.\nI am truly, madly, deeply in love.\nWith these thoughts ringing, resounding in my head, I head for my\nmistress\u2019 place once again. It is as late\nas it was on that first night, so long\nago. As I step inside her domain, I am\nsurprised by the people there. There\nwas never usually this many. There\nshouldn\u2019t be this many!\nFearing for my love, I hurry upstairs,\ntaking the steps two at a time. Breathless, I reach the top and can barely take\nin the sight before me. There is my\nparamour, on the table. Surrounded\nby other men. Each with their instruments directed at her, the same look\ncommon in their glances. They have\nher. And she enjoys it. The slut.\nDejected and rejected, I sink to the\nfloor. How could this have happened? I\nwas cheated on...by a book.\nYes, I have a love affair with books.\nOutside of drunken Medic piss-ups,\nlove can be hard to find in Imperial but\nI thought I had finally found someone\nwho understood me. Who accepted\nme for me.\nNow is the zenith of the revision\nperiod and the libraries are busier\nthan ever. On the one hand, I applaud\nof this; they are a fantastic resource,\ndeserving of our patronage. But, the\nconverse is that it\u2019s becoming so very\ndifficult to obtain the right textbooks.\nI have seen students do unspeakable\nthings to get hold of Vander\u2019s Human\nPhysiology. So I send this plea out to\nyou all.\nBy all means, revise. But revise\nconscientiously...\n...you might be breaking someone\u2019s\nheart.\nRhys Davies has been having a secret affair\n\u201cWith sacred\nsanctity, I peeled\nback her outer\ngarments and\nspread her\nbefore me.\u201d\nOssian Hynes wants you to help save humanities\nComment, Opinion\n& Letters\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of felix\nphoenix\nout now\n\u201cI am an atheist\n(eI\u03b8iIst). Not,\nI wish to take\ngreat pains to\npoint out, an\nidiot (Idi\u04d9t)\u201d\nT\nhose of you with more\ntime on your hands than\nyou should by rights admit\nto having may remember\nspending some of those\nextra minutes last week reading a comment piece about a Jewish wedding.\nFor the sake of pedantry, the piece was\nmine, the wedding was my sister\u2019s. This\nwallowing in successes past is not the\nresult of premature nostalgia but rather\na desire for clarification. You see, accompanying my article, in the very\nplace where Ossian Hynes\u2019 red crowd\nis above, was a picture of an undeniably\nJewish wedding.\nSo far, I am compelled to admit, so\ngood. Nothing the most pernickety of\npurists could carp or cavil at. A piece\nabout a Jewish wedding deserves a suitably descriptive and relevant picture\nand such, you have been led to under-stand, was indeed the case.\nThe picture, as overflowing with\nJudaica as it unquestionably was, and\ncontaining more black beards than you\ncould shake a stick at without being accused of starting a pogrom, was crucially lacking in one, albeit minor, respect.\nThe wedding being depicted was not\nmy sister\u2019s. I will, when pressed, grant\nthat I am regularly unable to \u2018spot the\n5 differences between these two pictures of Mickey Mouse to win a family\nholiday for 3 to EuroDisney\u2019, but I have\nlong prided myself on the ability to pick\nout one bride from another at twenty\npaces. No matter how far away I held\nlast week\u2019s copy of felix, however, I was\nable to spot subtle yet incontrovertible\nhints that the people celebrating were\nunknown to me.\nThis grieves me terribly, for I now\nfeel that I should have gone to greater\nlengths to ensure authenticity in the\nphotographic evidence. Not only would\nit have provided you with a much\nneeded dose of spiritual uplift, but the\nsight of my sister in her wedding finery\nwould have given you pleasant misconceptions about my own physical\nappearance.\nThe mismatched brides, however, are\nnot the only differences between the\nceremony I cherish in my heart and the\none so painfully portrayed in yesteryear\u2019s prosaic pixels. The groom (and I\nshould hope so too) is also a different\nfigure. Even the guests, unless someone\nhas had the audacity to scribble over\ntheir faces with a black magic marker,\nare entirely different.\nBut beyond mere personalities, the\nprocedure in the picture was a great\ndeal more orthodox than the one which\nI attended two weekends ago. Not that\nwe didn\u2019t try to make it more tradi-tional. My parents and I argued with\nthe happy couple till we were blue in\nthe face to scrap the wrestling-in-pig-fat part of the entertainment, and it was\nonly by dint of long and weary persuasion that we convinced them to cancel\nthe swastika decorations hanging down\nfrom the bridal canopy.\nAt the end of the day, however, to say\nnothing about earlier on in the after-noon, my family is not a religious one.\nWe are open and even defiantly proud\nof our ancient cultural heritage, but we\ndo not, as a rule, believe. I say \u2018we don\u2019t\nbelieve\u2019 in the same way as I am wont\nto say \u2018I don\u2019t drink\u2019 \u2013 with the unfortunate implication that I am something\nof a solipsistic camel: refusing to grant\nthe existence of anything and with absolutely no need for fluids.\nTo cut to the heart of the matter\nwith the finely-sharpened bludgeon\nof logical progression, I am an atheist\n(eI\u03b8iIst). Not, I wish to take great pains\nto point out, an idiot (Idi\u04d9t). I include\nthe pronunciation guides for these two\nwords so as to make the distinction\nabundantly and inescapably clear to\nreaders at home and abroad.\nAn idiot, for those of you who have\njust tuned in, is someone who jumps\nfrom one branch of the shaded and\nleafy tree of faith to another, mistaking the reflected light he is following\nfor the warm natural glow of reason felt\nby those who tread the solid ground.\nThe gradual descent from the trees is\nproving a recurrent theme in human\nevolution, but this particular specimen\nof foliage is proving especially comfort-able. In short, I have no patience for\nthose enlightened souls who cast off\nthe chains of religious fervour only to\nmake their new-found freedom as restrictive as any imprisonment.\nThough the historical and literal\nmeaning of the word \u2018atheist\u2019 seems to\nimply a vehement faith whose central\ntenet is \u2018there is no God and Dawkins is\nhis prophet\u2019, it is time for that to change.\nBut wait. It seems unfair of me to lure\nyou into what was ostensibly a perfectly\nfriendly comment piece only to hit you\nwith an opinion when your guard was\ndown. Not to worry, I\u2019ll come back to\nmy personal beliefs later. If you\u2019re very\ngood, next week you\u2019ll hear how they\ngot me in trouble at Speaker\u2019s Corner.\nGilead Amit feels the other side of editorial meddling\n\n"

Further, there is simply no way to convey the status of my\nmentality, my emotion, or anything\nbrewing in the subconscious level.\nWhile imprints of those absorbed by\nmy senses may remain lodged somewhere in my head, I am afraid the feelings related to these observations may\nbe lost forever.\nAnd that it isn\u2019t practical to ring up\nmy travel companions every time I\nstumble across a hotel, a person, or an\nitem whose name I can\u2019t recall.\nWhat I do recall are instants where\nI sat through bus journeys or waits\nfor trains, idly spent musing in a John\nDorian fashion. These valuable hours\ncould have been put to better uses, like\nwriting an entry in the journal.\nIt would have been a good time not\nonly to record past events for recol-lection. The tranquillity provides the\nperfect opportunity to reflect on my\nencounters, think beneath the surface,\nand put my thoughts into ink before it\nvanishes indefinitely.\nBesides, I have to have some kind of\npastime, especially when I finally get\nbored of whichever novel I happen to\nbe reading.\nThere is, however, a rub: what if I\nlose my journal? What if I am to go\nrafting at three in the morning, in a\ndrunken spree, and accidentally drop\nmy journal into the frozen waters be-neath? Will I be able to bear the loss,\nseeing it drift along the current, letters\ndissolve and fade into nothing?\nIn fact, I know someone who did exactly that.\nSimple. Just as you would back up\nyour photographs along your trav-els, reserve a spare copy of the travel\njournals.\nWithout hassling the photocopi-ers, the obvious method is to type up\nthe entries and save it digitally. Better\nstill, start a blog \u2012 when your family\nand friends are waiting impatiently for\nthe latest tales of your adventures, you\nwouldn\u2019t want to disappoint them.\nBut then, by the end of the day, with\nall of the excitement and anticipation\noccupying your precious time, is it\nworth the trouble?\nAt least make an effort. For your\nown sake, you will not regret it in a few\nyear\u2019s time when your memory decides\nto fail you.\nAnd trust me, you wouldn\u2019t want to\nbe in my position right now.\nDylan Lowe\nTravel Editor\nTravel journal:\nto keep or not\nto keep\nM\nind you, the place\nisn\u2019t what we Brits\nwould define as a\nseaside resort.\nFirst up, Essaouira\ndoesn\u2019t have a beach littered with chip-ies, English-speaking beer-serving\nbartenders, and nude sunbathers\u2019 foul-mouthed disputes over sun beds. The\nwaves, chopped up by the mighty Atlantic Ocean, extinguished any hopes\nfor a casual swim (but made it an ideal\nspot for windsurfers). Gusty breezes\nmade the sea shores an unsuitable\nvenue for anything more than an afternoon stroll.\nIt didn\u2019t stop us, however, from\nabandoning the majestic \u2012 and overly-touristy \u2012 splendours of Marrakesh for\na coach bound for this \u2018off-beaten\u2019 city.\nThere would be, as we perched on our\nterrace before the foamy ripples hours\nlater, no regrets.\n\u201cLooking for riad? I show you riad.\u201d\nThere were several peculiarities in\n\u201cwomen\nneglecting their\nhousehold roles\nto engage in\n\u2018masculine\u2019 work\nis a violation of\nsocial conduct\u201d\nscenes of this sort. Finding a Moroccan, whom I suppose you can define\nas a faux guide or tout, approaching\na pair of backpackers fresh off the bus\nand \u2018assisting\u2019 their search for a riad,\nwas not one of them. The individual\nconcerned complaining afterwards\nabout too small a tip wasn\u2019t either.\nWhat was unusual as the fact that\nour Moroccan \u2012 and escort who saved\nus the trouble of getting lost \u2012 happened to be female.\nIn this ultra-macho Muslim state,\nwhere the lads and lasses remain in\naccepted segregation prior to mar-riage, for women neglecting their traditional household roles to engage in\n\u2018masculine\u2019 work is a violation of social\nconduct. While sexism is encouraged,\ndishonouring it could get you much\nmore than just regular scorn in the\nneighbourhood.\nApparently not in Essaouira.\nJust as the name makes a fine tongue\ntwisters challenge (pronounced es-soo-WE-rah), its inaccessibility (un-reachable by plane or train, no vehicles permitted within Medina) meant\nEssaouira is reserved exclusively for\nthose who take their travelling a bit\nmore seriously, not to the blas\u00e9 week-enders. But it is changing. The city has\nlong been the eye candy of Morocco,\nwith its authentic 18th century Medina named a UNESCO World Heritage\nSite in 2001.\nSo where the Western liberals have\ndescended upon in their holiday mak-ing, it was bad news for the Moroccan\nmen and their cultural integrity. Not so\nmuch for the women, who have finally\ncast away their crockery for the better\ncareer prospects.\nIt didn\u2019t matter how many definitions of a riad you have read: a glimpse\nat the real thing would solve all mys-teries. My Lonely Planet might call it \u201ca\ntraditional house set around a garden\ncourtyard, restored and established as\nguesthouses\u201d. After hauling ourselves\nand the rucksacks across one maze of\na Medina, we found our accommodation shoved into a rugged back alley.\nInstead of opening up a Pandora\u2019s Box\nof interior design disasters, we discovered the rose petal- clad fountain\nglazed in sunlight from the atrium, the\ncolour-coded tiles daubed beneath our\nfootsteps towards reception. Three\nflights up later, we erased any remaining reservations and called the riad our\nnew home.\nThe view was persuasive enough\n\u2012 where better to recline in utter relaxation than facing the very ramparts\nOrlando Bloom scuttled across whilst\nrepelling Saracens in Kingdom of Heaven, and overlooking the very streets\nwhere Orson Welles filmed his adaptation of Othello some fifty years ago?\nThe city\u2019s artistic links don\u2019t end\nwith the movie industry \u2012 it had more\nto do with the talent of individual\nEssaouirans.\nA short walk away from the hotel revealed just how high the standards of\ninnovation Essaouira delivers. Beside\nmerchants selling paintings of immense quality, I spotted a shop exhibiting statues composed of welded junk.\nThe unseen genius, whom I recognised\nin a glance, had locked himself in his\nworkshop, away from the storefront,\nwhere his affair with imagination\nflared alongside the forge.\nAnd let\u2019s not forget that Essaouira\nhosts the Gnaoua and World Music\nFestival annually.\n\u201cEssaouira\nis reserved\nexclusively for\nthose who take\ntheir travelling\na bit more\nseriously\u201d\nAnother art form Essaouirans\nseemed to have perfected was hos-pitality. We were jostled around like\nsacks of gold in the frigid markets of\nMarrakesh, where customers are customers and customers only; shopkeepers in Essaouira may feel the urge to dig\ninto our wallets, they would still treat\nus with the dignity we deserve.\nThere was this one occasion where\nAnna had fallen ill with some sort of\nstomach discomfort: whilst shopping\nfor ceramics she asked for a chair to\nsit on, as the pain became unbearable.\nOur salesman happily obliged, before\nrushing off and returning with glasses\nof gingered spice tea. The owner of\nCaf\u00e9 Salma, a favourite spot of ours,\ngave Anna a delicate wooden sculpture of a camel upon hearing it was her\nbirthday.\nSpeaking of food, I had hardly a moment where I went about Essaouira\nempty-stomached. This place may well\nbe the living incarnation of any gastronome\u2019s dream. We were never too far\nfrom a restaurant that served tajines\nat affordable prices; just as we licked\nour fingers (quite literally as Moroccans eat with their hands) and contemplate an unsavoury treat, the patisserie\nwas always around the corner. Came\nnightfall and the kebab places livened\nwith aromas luring patrons to their\ndoorsteps, but if the hunger couldn\u2019t\nwait that long there were chickpeas,\ngiant doughnuts and cr\u00eapes in ready\nsupplies.\nFailing to mention its seafood would\nbe unjust to the city \u2012 all of the country\u2019s maritime resources originate\nfrom the Atlantic coast where Essaouira is located. A quick visit to the\nfish souk, a semi-open square where all\nfishy matters of trade are dealt, would\nshake your apparent knowledge of marine biology to the core. We took the\ntime to make a few purchases, brought\nit to the fish grills nearby: it made a\nperfect luncheon as our seafood came\nback chargrilled, served with bread\nand salad, all for a mere Dh 25 (\u00a32).\nEssaouira is where the customs of the\nArabic world and Western influence\ncoexist in perfect equilibrium. Even so,\nthis beautiful balance is threatened by\nthe increasing conversion of the city\ninto yet another tourist hotspot, and\nthe misinterpretation of Moroccan\nyouths on our values.\nIt is a sad thought; but at least I had\nthe privilege to appreciate it at its\nprime before the floods of tourist overflows the Medina.\nThe view from our riad room - priceless Looking down the atrium\nA massive pile of junk, quite literally\nShop selling paintings\nStreet scene in Essaouira\nTerracotta on display Fish souk\nSadly, I stopped logging my journey some five pages later\n\n"

An emotive and highly\ncharged term, apartheid at its simplest\nrefers to the South African regime\nfrom 1948 to 1994 but when used out\nof this historical context it implies a\nbroad economic, social and political\nsystem of denial and discrimination of\npeople of a certain ethnic group.

Indeed coupled with her assertion that there is a\ndominance of white students at Imperial and the LSE, one wonders if Ms.\nAbbott knows anything about Higher\nEducation in the UK.\nLetters to and from the Editor\nDear Felix,\nI was alarmed at an email I received\nfrom the Humanities department\nwarning that Imperial College would\nbe cutting its language provision in\n2010. Higher- level language courses\nand beginners\u2019 classes in languages\nsuch as Japanese and Italian would be\nno longer taught.\nI am currently a third year Erasmus\nstudents studying in France and I have\nbenefitted greatly from the wonderful teaching and support from the\nImperial humanities department. Not\nonly did I come to France with ample\nknowledge of the language to succeed\nin everyday life, I had a good base on\nwhich to build my vocabulary and\nimprove my grammar. Studying a language is a very enriching subject and I\nthink that it is important for students\nto still have the opportunity to learn\nlanguages as part of their degree.\nWhilst studying in France I have met\nmany students from different European countries who have had not only\nfree but compulsory language lessons\nas part of their degree. Of course it is\nimportant to learn English as it is the\nlanguage of science but many students\nI knew spoke another European lan-guage, other than English, that was not\nSave our languages\nprogramme\nWe are ever vigilant\nabout fluent\nspeakers\nDear Sir\nOn page three in the last issue (1,433),\none of your students interviewed about\nthe cuts said that \u2018people in language\ncourses are more fluent than they let\non\u2019.

Like many other\nImperial students, I have personally benefitted tremendously from the\nfantastic language tuition offered by\nthe Humanities programme, both on\na cultural level and as preparation for\nthe year I spent on exchange in Switzerland. And like hundreds of other\nImperial students, I am immensely\ngrateful to College for allowing me\nthe opportunity to have spent a year\nabroad, surrounded by a culture, and\npeople, completely new and different\nto those back home. This is an immensely enriching experience which\nI would urge anyone considering it to\ntake; going on exchange was probably\nthe best decision I\u2019ve ever made and I\nknow many, many other ex-Erasmus\nstudents would say the same.\nSo it is with great sadness that I read\nthe news about these cuts, because I\nknow this will directly deny that same\nopportunity to many more students in\nthe future, and many more will likewise be denied the chance to come to\nImperial in return. This will restrict\nthe students eligible to go abroad to\nonly those with prior knowledge of the\nhost language, and will therefore have\nthe greatest impact on exchanges to\nthe less mainstream, and often more\ninteresting countries. This will make\nfor a culturally much poorer college.\nWe at the Erasmus club are completely mystified as to how a 5% col-lege-wide budget cut can result in the\ndecimation of one of the most valuable\nparts of the College. Does the College\nreally care about student satisfaction?\nIf so, can they not see that for a set\nof challenging optional courses to be\nmassively oversubscribed by students\nmeans that they are extremely highly\nvalued? Does the College really care\nabout graduate employability? If so, do\nthey not realise how valuable even basic foreign language skills are in the UK\njobs market, where they are so hard to\ncome by?\nI speak not only for the present\nmembers of the Erasmus club, but\nabove all for our future members, for\nprospective students, for those who\nwill lose out, in urging the College to\nreconsider these proposals. We understand cuts must be made, but please,\nuse some common sense; Languages\nare simply too valuable to the College\nand to students to be culled in this way.\nYours sincerely,\nChristopher Thomas\nErasmus Club President 2008-09\ntheir mother tongue. Languages are a\ngreat benefit and rewarding to study.\nIt is a great achievement having a conversation with somebody in a language\nthat is not your own.\nLanguages are important for business and science, we must give up this\n\u201cwhy bother everybody speaks English\nanyway\u201d attitude. Speaking another\nlanguage opens the number of people\nyou can communicate with and also\nmakes you very aware of your competency in your own language.\nPlease do not let the languages programme at Imperial College disap-pear. My Erasmus year has been very\nrewarding and I hope that the opportunity will remain for people to study\nlanguages for years to come.\nLaura Shemilt\n...................................................\nDear Christopher and Laura\nFirstly, I am glad that you are keen to\nuse felix as a means of expressing your\nalarm at the imminent humanities\ncuts. I hope that you will be glad to\nhear that several students have already complained about the potential\ncuts and a demonstration has been\nplanned for the 3rd June outside the\nFaculty Building.\nIn the meantime, we will try to keep\neveryone up-to-date with the latest developments regarding the humanities\ncourses.\nHope to see you on the 3rd\nYours Sincerely\nJovan Nedic\nfelix Editor-in-Chief\nThere is an important question to\nbe addressed regarding black students\nin higher education, namely \u201cWhy is\nthere a low proportion of black students at Russell group universities and\na high proportion of black students at\nformer polytechnics?\u201d However Ms.\nAbbott has cheapened the discussion by being needlessly provocative\nand thus (whether wilfully or just out\nof carelessness) distracted the debate\nfrom the key point, which is the failures of the support system available to\nblack students before they even make\ntheir UCAS applications.\nUltimately, Ms Abbott has done her\nconstituents and the debate a disserv-ice. By flagrantly raising the spectre of\nracism she makes it more difficult to\nhave a productive and candid conversation on this issue. And by refusing to\nacknowledge that Russell group institutions like Imperial and the LSE admit\nstudents based only on their academic\nachievements, she has achieved nothing of any value, except maybe to garner some media attention for herself.\nDon\u2019t forget to fill out the letter and\nreturn it to us if you think that Diane\nAbbott\u2019s comments were inappropriate\n\n"

Your mum\nA\ns many of you reading this\nwill appreciate, I have become a little bit obsessed\nwith a certain food programme on iPlayer. Great\nBritish Menu has really captivated my\nimagination, excited my palate and ruined an hour of my dissertation work\nevery evening in the past few weeks. The\ncompetition aims to find 4 dishes that\nrepresent a Taste of Home that will be\ncooked in a banquet for troops coming\nhome from Afghanistan. Some of the\nbest chefs in the country have offered up\ntheir \u2018Taste of Home\u2019 with the obligatory\ngastronomic twist. Quotation marks fly\nacross the menus like they are going out\nof fashion. What is the difference between \u2018chicken\u2019 and chicken, anyway? Is\nit the thought of chicken on a plate, or\nthe scent of a chicken wafted across the\ndish? Or is a carrot called Chicken, by\nsome strange interspecial twist?\nAnyhoo, the chefs\u2019 offerings included\n[Dover Sole] Fish Fingers with Mushy\nPeas, [Duck] Pie with [Duck] Scratchings, Corned Beef with \u2018HP\u2019 sauce and\nLancashire Hotpot with pickled Cabbage. There is obviously a lot of regional\nrivalry here which makes the competition even more enjoyable. It also brings\na lot of fond, nostalgic memories to\nmind. Despite being a Northerner by\nassociation, most of my memorable culinary memories reside in the south. They\ninclude Fish Fingers with lemon juice\naccompanied by Sesame Street and Sardines on hot, buttery toast with a side of\nSuperTed.\nObviously the chefs competing have\nput a lot of thought, imagination and\ntop-quality ingredients into what they\nthink is a \u2018Taste of Home\u2019. I would re-Roast H\nThe Floral Hall, Borough Market\nwww.roast-restaurant.com\nBest bits: Venue, ingredients\nWorst bits: Lack of imagination,\nhigh prices\nServes 4\n25g butter\n4 chicken breasts, diced (or Quorn works very well, too)\n1 onion, finely chopped\n1 red chilli, finely chopped\n400 mL coconut milk (tin or from powder)\n300 mL chicken stock\nSeveral of handfuls of vegetables (e.g. okra or spinach)\nSalt and Pepper\nCook the chicken in the butter for 5 minutes. Add the onion and chilli\nto the pan. Cook for 4 minutes, or until the onions are soft. Add the\ncoconut milk and chicken stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for 10\nminutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in your chosen vegetables. Cook for 5 minutes then season appropriately. If the\nsauce is still quite liquid, reduce it by cooking with the lid off. Serve\nwith noodles or rice.\nCoconut Chicken\nally like to find out what your Taste of\nHome is, be it tea and biscuits or Spam.\nSend me a short email (food.felix@impe-rial.ac.uk) with your name, year of study,\ncourse and what your Taste of Home is,\nand why?\nBefore I run out of steam, let me add\nmy mini fortnightly compendium of\nquick recipes for you to try. This week,\nI thought beans would be a good idea.\nTinned beans are so versatile and super-cheap. They form the basis of many\nsummer salads, dips and soups. Here are\na few quick cook ones for your belly:\n1. Broad bean and feta salad. Drain\nand rinse a tin of broad beans. In a bowl,\nmash up \u00bd a packet of feta cheese and\nstir in the beans. Add a dash of olive oil\nthen scoop into pitta breads for a tasty\nlunch.\n2. Lentil Salad. Chop 1 onion, 1 red\npepper and a few lardons of bacon (op-tional). Cook in a little oil until softened\nthen add a drained tin of green lentils.\nStir for a couple of minutes then season\nand add a dash of olive oil. Serve with\ngrilled meats or hard boiled eggs.\n3. Bean Spead. Take a tin of your favourite beans (cannellini beans work\nwell). Drain and rinse the beans then\nmush them in a bowl with a dash of olive oil. Add a handful of fresh parsley\nand a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve on\nhot, buttered toast or as an alternative to\nmayo in sandwiches.\nI hope you enjoy the rest of the food\npage this week. David Stewart lays into\noverprices British Grub at the Overpriced Borough Market and I\u2019ve given\nyou (another) dish to try out. In the\nmeantime, good luck in your exams and\ndon\u2019t forget to send any nostalgic food\nmemories my way. Ta, duck!\nT\nhere isn\u2019t a single week\nthat goes past without\nsome uninspiring journalism about how British\ncuisine is doomed/mis-understood/world-beating. Perhaps\nmy feeling about the restaurant Roast\ntypifies my view.\nOne can\u2019t help but notice a revival\nof classic dishes from around the UK\n(Yorkshire puddings, Lancashire Hotpot, Treacle Tart, and so forth) and\nhelp but think that preserving traditions (even bad ones) has great merit\nand makes the world a better place. So\nI am all in favour of such a revival but\nwhere there is a genuine movement\nfor something - a fashion, if you will -there are also hangers-on.\nThese are people who find out which\nway a trend is heading and copy it\nwithout adding anything substantial.\nRoast is to the British Food Revival\nwhat Top Shop is to Couture. Except\nit\u2019s worse than that. Top Shop at least\ncreates affordable versions of the latest thing than almost anyone can buy.\nRoast produces mediocre versions of\nwhat people should be cooking in their\nown homes and charges the prices\nthat only the well-off can afford. Roast\nshows us in fact, just how far we have\nyet to come as a nation and shows us\nthat the population need to learn how\nto cook.\nI don\u2019t want to dwell on the absurdly\nboring food for too long but it is necessary to prove my thesis that I mention\nsome of it. Perhaps the food is exemplified by Dorset crab cake with fried\nsquid, chilli and soured cream (\u00a315.00)\nwhere a few flakes of crab are drowned\nin mashed potato and covered in nacho dressing. Or perhaps it\u2019s exemplified by English calf\u2019s liver with marrow fat peas and smoked ham hock\n(\u00a319.00) which fails even in conception\nto work .\nHow does such a place succeed then?\nIt is admittedly a nice venue. It is admittedly sourcing fantastic ingredients\nfrom downstairs in Borough Market.\nBut that\u2019s not the real reason. It\u2019s that\npeople (particularly ones with more\nmoney than sense) can\u2019t cook. This is\nthe sort of food which should appear\non one\u2019s dining table on a daily basis.\nIts easy food; its food your mother\nprobably cooked for you for Sunday\nLunch. I was flabbergasted to find\nout by watching Celebrity Come Dine\nWith Me that that venomous little\nvile, vitriolic prepubescent brat caught\nin the body of a bald man seethe-pot\nToby Young, literally hasn\u2019t the faintest\nidea even how to roast a fillet of beef\n(which he shouldn\u2019t be doing anyway).\nSo naturally when someone does the\neminently possible and produces some\ndevilled kidneys on toast some incompetent fathead like Young goes wild,\neven if charged over a tenner for it.\nRoast is really is no better than paying someone to hand you a towel in the\nGents when you can get the thing perfectly bloody well yourself, thank you.\nIt is as acceptable not to be able to cook\nthis food as it is not to be able to wipe\nyour own arse.\nRoast gets a roasting\nDavid Stewart lays in to all those copycats out there. Miaow!\nEating a Roast at Roast is just too ironic to behold.

    "content": "Financial Meltdown\nAs the rest of the world seems to be\nplunging into financial turmoil, it\nseems that even the financial world of\nImperial College Union cannot escape\nthe problems. At the end of the Easter\nterm it was found that there were nearly \u00a3129,000 worth of outstanding invoices that were owed to various clubs\nand societies at ICU, some dating back\nto November 2007.\nThis backlog of outstanding pay-ments, both to the Union and external\ncompanies, has created some tension\nbetween the numerous treasurers and\nclub captains of Imperial, and the finance office of the Union. Back in\nMarch, Live! reported on the problems\nthe Guilds Vice President (Finance &\nSocieties), John James, faced when\nhe attempted to complete the final\ncheques for the clubs and societies\nbefore they all went away on holiday\n(http://live.cgcu.net/news/1948). The\nLive! story points out that despite the\nfact that the clubs had completed their\nforms on time, the absence of the finance staff has meant that some clubs\nand societies will be out of pocket over\nthe holidays.\nThe example given in the Live! article is only one of many that outlines\nthe problems within the finance office,\nhowever, the one recurring problem\nthat the club and society officers have\nis the speed at which the invoices are\nprocessed and appear online. As a re-sult, the accounts of the various clubs\nappear to have less in them than they\nactually had, which meant that some\nrudimentary expenses, such as hire of\nminibuses or equipment, was not possible as the finance office would not\nallow it.\nThere are several reasons for the\ndelay in the processing of these pay-ments, the main one being that the\ncompanies have not paid them yet. The\ninformation that was obtained by felix\nshows that by the 27th March 2009,\nroughly \u00a3110,000 of invoices were still\nunpaid according to the finance of-fice, with felix, Finance Society and the\nCity and Guilds College Union Exec all\nbeing owed around \u00a326,000, \u00a312,000\nand \u00a310,000 respectively. Even more\nworrying is the fact that there is some\n\u00a311,000 of outstanding invoices that\nare not assigned to any clubs or socie-ties, according to the data, and one can\nonly wonder how they will assign the\nmoney.\nA common problem that the finance\noffice point out is the lack of information from the clubs that will enable the\nprocessing of the invoices to be quick-er, the main thing being lack of sufficient contact details for the companies\nthat need to pay the invoice. Common\npractice, however, is to put a contact\nname and address of the payee on the\ninvoice, which would mean that the\nfinance office could get in touch with\nthe company if payment is overdue.\nAnother problem that often occurs is\nthat when clubs chase up the invoices,\nthe companies often tell them that the\ninvoice has in fact been paid, meaning\nthat the payment has not been processed by the finance department. It is\nunclear how much of the \u00a3110,000 has\nactually been paid but not processed,\nbut it is believed to be several tens of\nthousands. This often leaves the club\nofficer in rather an embarrassing situ-ation, having to apologise for the mis-communication between the finance\noffice and the clubs.\nThe data obtained by felix also shows\nthat nearly \u00a318,000 worth of invoices\nhave been cancelled, effectively losing\ncosting the clubs, the worst of these\nbeing Finance Society and IC Hockey\nClub who have lost out on \u00a36,750 and\n\u00a36,000 respectively. The hockey club\nhas since told felix that the \u00a36000 was\nfor the sponsorship that they received\nfrom Merrill Lynch and that the payment was in fact made back in September, the fact that the finance office\nwas still chasing up the invoice was a\n\u201cmystery\u201d to the club and they have\nsince contacted the finance office to\nrectify the problem.\nThe lack of organisation that seems\nto be evident within the finance office is certainly prooving to be a prob-lem, and their problems can be compounded with several HR complaints\namongst the staff within the finance\noffice, notably between the Head of\nFinance and the member of staff responsible for Clubs and Societies. This\ndoes not seem to be a one-off, howev-er, as sources have revealed that there\nis more animosity in the finance office\nthan they really want to let on.\nOne problem that does exists is the\napparent inexperience of the Head of\nFinance, for whom this is their first\ntime working in a Students\u2019 Union and\nthus really don\u2019t understand the financial system. Some of her great gaffs\ninclude not realising why there were\nmassive increases in profit at the end\nof each term (Carnivals, Freshers\u2019 Fair\nand end of term balls) and why in June\nthere is a huge profit and then a massive loss in July (Summer Ball income\nand outcome!!!)\nAfter hearing about the findings,\nDeputy President (Finance & Services)\nChristian Carter, told felix that:\n\u201cWe are aware that this is a problem,\nthis year membership services have\ntemporarily taken on club credit control and have made a start at clearing\nthe invoices the outstanding amount\nnow sits at \u00a396K. We envisage the\nfinance department taking on club\ncredit control next year and hopefully\nit will not build up to this level again.\u201d\n4 felix Friday 29 May 2009\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nFriday 29 May 2009 felix\nNews\nThe world beyond\ncollege walls\nThis Thursday June 4th, Europe\u2019s citizens will vote for a\nnew European Parliament.\nThe elections, which occur every five years, elect 736\nMember of European Parliaments (MEPs) to represent\nthe 500 million Europeans,\nbut are widely seen with apathy by citizens in many of the\n27 member states.\nMany people, especially in\nBritain which is characterised by its higher levels of euro-scepticism, view the European Union (EU) as\nan ineffective bureaucracy which has little impact on their lives, and is filled\nwith out-of-touch officials in Brussels.\nLess known is that the European Parliament uses a proportional representation system, is the biggest directly elected transnational body of its kind,\nand is one of the most powerful legislatures in the world. It is estimated that\n6 out of 10 laws enacted in Britain come from the EU. With faith in the political system at an all time low in Britain, a plethora of new smaller parties like\nLibertas, NO2EU and The Jury Team are hoping to capture our imagination.\nEuropean Union\nTerror attacks have returned to the city of Lahore, as a bomb detonated\nat a police station killed 30 Pakistanis and injured 200.\nThe attack is likely to be the work of the Taliban in revenge of Pakistan\u2019s\ncurrent military offensive against them in the Northern region called Swat,\nwhich borders Afghanistan. Since being deposed from power in Afghanistan\nin 2001, the fundamentalist political movement has survived in fragments\nand is fighting a guerrilla war, much to the dislike of NATO, and the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nThe bomb detonated in Lahore, Pakistan\u2019s second largest city, is a further\ndestabilising factor for the country\u2019s fragile political system.\nThe conflict between Pakistan\u2019s Army and Taliban insurgents in Swat has\ndramatically worsened since April 2009. This is when Pakistan launched its\noffensive, saying the Taliban had broken the controversial February 2009\npeace deal between them. A massive humanitarian disaster has developed,\nwith 2.4 million Pakistanis being displaced and international aid agencies urgently asking for donations.\nPakistan\nA nuclear device, almost\nthe size of the bomb\ndropped on Hiroshima\nin WWII, was detonated\nunder North Korea this\nweek.\nThe \u201csuccessful\u201d nuclear\ntest has heightened fears\nof North Korea attacking South Korea, Japan\nor its other neighbours in\nthe near future, prompted\nemergency meetings of the UN Security Council and received international\ncondemnation.\nMost countries have stopped testing nuclear weapons, whether atmospheric or underground for more than a decade. The USA stopped in 1992,\nChina & France in 1996, and India & Pakistan (non-signatories of the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty) in 1998.\nBut North Korea, under dictator Kim Jong-il, broke the trend with its first\ntest in 2006, and now a second in 2009. From recording the seismic activity,\nthe most recent device was estimated to have a yield of about 30 terajoules\n(TJ), less than the 63TJ bomb (or 15 kilotons equivalent of TNT) nicknamed\n\u201cLittle Boy\u201d dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945. In comparison most nuclear weapons stockpiled by nuclear states today yield at least\n2,000TJ.\nNorth Korea\nEdited by Hassan Joudi & Raphael Houdmont\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor-in-Chief\nApologies for a mistake made in last week\u2019s issue; the capital of\nGuatemala is in fact Guatemala City and not Caracas, which is the\ncapital of Venezuela.\nNote from the Editor\nIf you feel that the comments made by Diane Abbott are as outrageous as\nwe do, then please fill out the letter that we have prepared for you all on the\nnext page.\nAll you need to do is put your name at the top of the page and sign it.

The group currently stands at\n1000 members strong. Organiser Daniel Burrows explained that the protest\nneeded to address a potentially \u201chuge\nstep back for an international community\u201d like Imperial.\nStudents wanting to make College\naware of their disapproval of the Languages provision next year are agreeing to meet on Queen\u2019s Lawn at midday on Wednesday the 3rd of June.\nThe petition will be presented and\nfurther signatures will be gathered\nwhilst the congregation collectively\nmarch to the Faculty Building to hand\nin the petition. Burrows has confirmed\nthat relevant members of staff including the Rector, Sir Roy Anderson\nhave been made aware of the protest.\nWhether or not he will be present in\nthe Faculty Building on Wednesday is\nunconfirmed.\nThe protest seems to be the first opportunity that the students of Imperial have been able to properly express\ntheir views the decisions made under\nCollege\u2019s review of the Humanities\nprogramme. Despite College\u2019s claim\nthat they used student representatives within the review process, only\ntwo were used at the very last stage of\nthe review after proposals had already\nbeen ratified. Hannah Theodorou,\nDeputy President for Education and\nWelfare and Alex Grisman, CGCU Academic Affairs Officer, were brought in\nto only provide feedback on related issues including the restructuring of the\nCollege day and course cuts. Burrows\nwas keen to emphasize his discontent\nconcerning the lack of student involvement in these decisions.\n\u201cOf the 13,000 undergraduate students here only 2 were part of this\ndecision. Well the other 12,998 of us\nbelieve it is time to be heard.\u201d\nNot Alone\nImperial however, is not the only\nuniversity to suffer reductions in\nLanguages provision and subsequent\nnegative student reaction. Oxford,\nKing\u2019s College London and Edinburgh\nUniversity are also having to decrease\ntheir degree streams in languages due\nto budget cuts.\nImperial students\u2019 planned protest\nfor the 3rd of June follows Edinburgh\u2019s\nsuit. 200 staff and students rallied to\nsave Russian and Portuguese degrees\nearlier this month. National media are\nnow following all four situations.\nDifferent Perspectives\nSince the news of the proposed cutbacks have caused such a furore, felix\nhas dug deep to bring you every side of\nthis fiasco possible; students, College,\nstaff from the Humanities Department, and Imperial College Union all\nhave their say on the matters.\nNot surprisingly, the biggest contrast\nin perspectives is between College and\nthe rest of bodies of people consulted.\nWhilst students and Humanities staff\nargue languages give a competitive\nedge when applying for jobs, the College are eager to emphasise the importance in \u201ccommunication skills\u201d as an\nemployability advantage. One student\nfelt he was being driven down \u201cnarrower and narrower pathways.\u201d\nWhilst Deputy President for Education and Welfare Hannah Theodorou\nblames funding cuts and urges students to see sense in the proposals, it\nseems both directly affected staff and\nstudents were not consulted prior\nto College passing these proposals.\nHence, they are seemingly finding it\nhard to see any sense in the imminent\ncuts.\nWith students discontent with what\nhas been put in front of them by the\nstaff that are about to lose their jobs in\nthe cuts, it is seemingly College\u2019s cue\nto react. felix will follow the inevitable\nupdates on the situation.\nHumanities cutback response continued\ncontinued from page 3\nLabour MP claims there is\nan \u201cunspoken apartheid\u201d at\nImperial and the LSE\nJovan Nedi\u0107\n& Kadhim Shubber\nDiane Abbott, the Labour MP for\nHackney North & Stoke Newington,\nhas caused controversy by linking Imperial and the LSE with apartheid at a\nWestminster Hall Debate on the 20th\nof May.\nDuring the debate, which concerned\nthe London Metropolitan Universtity\n(LMU), an institution in Ms. Abbott\u2019s\nconstituency, the MP said \u201cI draw the\nHouse\u2019s attention to the unspoken\napartheid in higher education in London.\u201d She continued remarking \u201cThe\nRussell group, including Imperial and\nthe LSE, is largely white, and some of\nthe former polytechnics are largely\nblack and minority ethnic\u201d.\nHer claims came as a surprise to\nImperial students, many of whom\ncommented that their experiences of\nuniversity did not match Ms. Abbott\u2019s\nbeliefs. When asked if she had visited\neither Imperial\u2019s or the LSE\u2019s campuses\nshe replied only that she \u201chad visited\nthe campus of the LSE recently\u201d\nBoth Imperial College London and\nthe LSE, universities that pride themselves as international institutions,\npost detailed breakdowns of their student\u2019s ethnicity online.\nIn 2008-2009, 35% of Imperial students were white, while 30% were\nblack, asian or of mixed background.\nThe remaining 35% of students declined to give their ethnic background.\nThere is no other information about\nthis final group of students, but without assuming that they are all white,\nit is clear that Ms. Abbott\u2019s claim that\n\u201cImperial\u2026 is largely white\u201d is not supported by the evidence available.\nIn 2007-2008, 35% of students from\nthe LSE can be reasonably classed as\nnon-white (students from Asia, South\nAmerica and Africa as well as UK ethnic minority students).\nUnfortunately detailed information\nabout the ethnicity of other international students (from North America,\nEurope and Australasia who make up\nanother 40% of students) is not avail-able. The remaining 25% are white\nstudents from the UK. Depending on\none\u2019s interpretation of \u201clargely white\u201d,\nit would appear that Ms. Abbott\u2019s\ndescription of the LSE is at the least,\nover-dramatic.

Rosie Milton and bare-footed friend went along to do just that\nO\nver the bank holiday,\nthe Tate Modern staged\nfor the public a friendly\nart festival, aptly titled\n\u2018The Long Weekend\u2019,\nand hosted the re-creation of 1970\u2019s\nartist of Anti-Form Robert Morris\u2019s\ninteractive installation: \u2018Bodyspacemotionthings\u2019. Using both the indoor\nand outdoor spaces of the infamous\nturbine hall and capitalizing on the\nbeautiful weather (a work of art in it-self, surely!), the Tate provided a mini\nfair of burgeoning creativity and the\nchance for visitors to run amok amidst\nartworks. Well, almost. Morris\u2019s installation of 1971 was one of the first of its\nkind \u2013 the first exhibit in the traditionally regimented and frozen space of the\ngallery, also theoretically known as the\n\u2018white cube\u2019, where the boundaries between artwork and audience were always defined \u2013 to subvert this role and\nprovide the eager arts amateur with a\nfully interactive exhibit. It consisted of\na gallery space installed with plywood\nstructures and metal supports: slopes,\nspheres and tunnels of varying shapes\nand depths throughout. The response\nto this \u2018adult\u2019s playground\u2019 was ex-traordinary: people descended upon\nMorris\u2019s vision of physical interaction\ntearing off their clothes, piling on top\nof one another and gladly snagging\ntheir flesh on the splintered wood, all\nin a revelry of youthful rebellion. They\nmet the chance to break the \u2018rules\u2019 with\nrelish. Flash forward to last weekend,\n2009 and we approached \u2018Bodyspacemotionthings\u2019 with obvious trepida-tion. Giant plywood climbing frames\nloomed and loud hollow sounds of\nwood clanging on concrete rang out\nthrough the hall, met with the chatter of excited children, adults and the\nelderly even, all patiently queuing for\neach working part of the exhibit that\nthey could manipulate themselves.\nIt certainly wasn\u2019t the frenzied Bacchic revelry of the 1970\u2019s, but then I\nwasn\u2019t really expecting that, living in\nthis health-and-safety-conscious society of the modern age. Instead we felt\nconstantly overshadowed by guards\non walkie-talkies, only allowing \u2018four\nat a time\u2019 and shepherding us into orderly lines. This policing created an\nenvironment sadly lacking spontaneity\nand the many children running around\nthis unlikely jamboree altered the exhibit\u2019s significance from its original\npurpose: as a radical innovation in art.\nThe initial exhibit had been potent in\nits meaning and responded to accord-ingly. The Tate Modern houses many\nworks that were ground breaking in\ntheir time and in order to fully appreciate their position within the history of\nart one has to bring some imagination\ninto the gallery space of today. Morris\nhad been interested in theatre and per-formance, and experimented with the\nabstract forms of minimal art and the\nenergy of the stage, sometimes within\nthe gallery space, resulting in an art\nof process. Records of the creation of\nthese active artworks in both film and\nphotograph are important to us for\nour experience and understanding of\nthem. Those who were watching the\nworks being \u2018made\u2019 at the time were\npart of the process themselves, and it is\nthis agency which we can relive by recreating it on screen. At the entrance to\nthe \u2018Bodyspacemotionthings\u2019 exhibit,\na television screen showed a video of\nrecorded excerpts from the 1971 ex-hibition: a girl walking inside a giant\nrolling tube and the back of another,\nnude, walking gradually towards the\nplywood structures.\nAlthough at the time of our visit we\nwere not nude (unless you can count\nmy friend\u2019s bare feet) and we were not\nperversely frenzied, I still feel as if we\ncontributed to \u2018the process\u2019 that afternoon \u2013 if only in retreading the bold\nstomping of the past with our own\nsofter, brooding footfalls.\n\u2018Bodyspacemotionthings\u2019 has been\nextended to the 14th June at the Tate\nModern\nVisit the Tate Modern, Bankside,\nto interact with Robert Morris\u2019\nrecreation of his pioneering 1971\ninstallation - for free!\nVisitor participation at the Tate Modern\u2019s \u2018Do It Yourself\u2019 festival It was refreshing to see some abandoned disregard for health and safety\nStreet Ballet straight from Brazil\nThe Barbican delights again over the Bank Holiday weekend with a dance act as exotic as their homeland\nand with as much boundless energy and charisma. Caz Knight reports back on Bale de Rua\nW\nhat words come\nto mind when one\nthinks of Brazil?\nSexy, beautiful,\nparty, dance, ex-otic, exhilarating, vivacious, Caipirinha \u2013 in short everything the U.K is\nnot and never will be (unless your only\nview of Brazil comes from watching\nCity of God.)\nBale de Rua is all of these things, bringing a sample of Carnival to the City\nof London. Bale de Rua (\u201cStreet ballet\u201d) was founded by Marco Antonio\nGarcia \u2013 who has also masterminded\nthe extraordinary mix of choreogra-phy, lighting and set design \u2013 in 1992\nas a community project for marginal-ised youngsters in Uberlandia, a small\ncity in the heart of Brazil. Ten years of\nperseverance, hard work and dedication later the troupe was discovered\nat Lyon\u2019s Biennale de la Danse and\nsince then they have delighted crowds\nall across Europe throughout several\ntours. This group of lithe, agile bodies (fifteen men and one woman)\nhave enough electric energy between\nthem for ten fold more as they step,\njump and fly for seventy five minutes\nthrough the history of Brazil.\nThe show begins with a light, feminine\nenergy as old-school samba plays, the\ntroupe dressed in snappy white suits\nand trilby hats. As time progresses\nand the dancers strip down, the story\nadopts a darker, fiercer more masculine feel which harkens back to the days\nof slavery and the passage of Brazil\u2019s\npeople from mother Africa. The drum\nbeats boom with earth shuddering\nbass emanating from the speakers and\nthrough the floor, giving the proceedings a voodoo quality, the magic made\nmore real when a dark figure is made\ntechnicolour as he is spat on with paint\nby the other dancers \u2013 one of the many\nbrilliant devices Garcia has used to\nmake the production even more spe-cial. Slaves sail across the seas in large\nmetal bowls and then slam these down\ncreating a mighty boom.\nFor all the primordial, and sometimes\noverpowering, energy created by these\nsculpted, macho dancers, they have no\nqualms about donning gypsy dresses\nand acting the pious peasant woman\nand then adorning themselves with flo-ra. In what is perhaps the most beautiful scene, huge coloured flowers grow\nfrom the scaffolding and the stage is\nbathed in UV light so that the dancers\nrecede from vision as the fluorescent\nflowers strapped to their heads, arms,\nchests and knees whirl about the stage.\nThe music shifts back and forth between samba, favela funk, hip-hop\n(with a dose of live rap) and that powerful drumming which tailors perfectly\nto the routines on stage. Break dance,\nCapoeira and body popping are a few\nof the acts that accompany on stage pyrotechnics which make every moment\nvibrant. The troupe perform with vi-vacity, each one bringing their own individual dimension and each one clearly loving every moment along with the\naudience who give them a thoroughly\nwell deserved standing ovation as they\ntake their final bow. Although criticised for trying to pack too much in,\nthe show never feels cramped, for this\nis entertainment which seeks to delight\nthrough performance and not through\nplot.\nCatch them while you can: Bale\nde Rua perform for a final time at\nthe Barbican on May 31 2009\nBale de Rua: juxtaposing masculine ferocity with feminine vibrance and telling the story of Brazil.

Do you think \u2018rubbish\u2019? \u2018Worthless\u2019? \u2018Bill and Ted\u2019?\nUnfortunately, the English courts\nhave ruled that to them it means \u2018deliberately dishonest\u2019, and in a case that has\nchilling ramifications for every scien-tist, journalist, writer and investigator\nin the country, have used that definition as the basis for allowing the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) to\nsue Imperial graduate and a science\nwriter Simon Singh for defamation.\nChiropractic is an alternative therapy that, at its most basic level, claims\nthat almost every ailment of the human body can be cured by cracking the\njoints in your spine, allowing the unrestricted flow of \u2018natural intelligence\u2019\nthroughout your body and restoring it\nto function. While this may have made\nsense when chiropractic was first made\nup/discovered in 1895, physiology has\ncome on some way since then; in common with many such \u2018alternative\u2019 ap-proaches, chiropractic hasn\u2019t kept up.\nTo be fair, the technique does show\nsome moderate success with lower\nback pain \u2013 although the effect is similar to taking painkillers and stretching\nand is both more expensive and potentially risky for the patient. However, it\nhas never been shown to be much use\nfor anything else.\nThe case centres around an article\nSingh wrote for the Guardian around\na year ago, based on a leaflet the BCA\nhad produced called Happy Families.\nIt\u2019s terrifying. In it, the BCA alleged\nthat:\n\u201cThere is evidence to show that chiropractic care has helped children\nwith: asthma, colic, prolonged crying,\nsleep and feeding problems, breathing\ndifficulties, hyperactivity, bed-wetting,\nfrequent infections, especially in the\nears\u201d\nAs in, if you manipulated the spine of\na new-born baby (and they do recommend treating newborns in this way),\nyou could make it stop crying.

The viruses normally infect the guts of birds,\ntypically a warmer 40\u00b0 Celsius, so the\nresearchers suspect that our lower\ntemperature protects us. The avian influenza viruses normally enter the human body through the nose, so are unlikely to infect people and cause illness.\nThere is also the possibility that a\nhuman influenza virus could mutate\nby adapting proteins from an avian\ninfluenza virus. The study shows that\na virus of this form would also struggle to take hold at 32\u00b0 Celsius, just like\nthe regular avian influenza virus, so we\nwould be safe unless the virus mutated\nway.\nRecommendations like that, based\non little or no evidence of efficacy,\ncan lead to people getting badly hurt\n\u2013 even if it had been proven to work,\nI\u2019d be hesitant before letting someone\nshove around the vertebrae in a baby,\nand this \u2018treatment\u2019 doesn\u2019t have that\ndistinction. In his article, Singh said\nroughly the same thing, pointing out\nthat despite the fact that \u201cthere is not a\njot of evidence\u201d, the BCA \u201chappily promotes [these] bogus treatments\u201d.\nNow, science only makes advances\nthrough endless doubt and self-crit-icism of existing ideas. If you ever\npresent at a conference, you\u2019ll probably\nface some pretty hostile questions: the\ngrown-up response is to reach for your\nevidence, and to argue based upon the\ninterpretation of independently verifiable facts. The BCA response was to\nsue.\nWorse still, the notoriously plaintiff\nfriendly libel courts of the UK agreed\nwith them. Singh does not suggest in\nthe article that the BCA deliberately\naim to deceive; simply that they promote therapies which do not work.\nHowever, the judge Justice Eady felt\nthat the word \u2018bogus\u2019 implied deliberate deception, and as such Singh is\nDuncan Casey\nA new study has found that goldfish\nmay feel pain, and react to it in a similar way to humans.\nPreviously, scientists believed that\nfish brains are not sufficiently developed to allow them to sense pain or\nfear. Fish responses to harmful stimuli were thought to be simple reflex\nactions.\nBut now researchers from Purdue\nUniversity in the US and the Norwegian School of Veterinary Science have\ndemonstrated that fish may in fact experience reflexive and cognitive pain,\nas humans do. These findings could\nraise questions about current slaughter methods and standards of care in\nresearch using fish.\nReport co-author Dr Joseph Garner from Purdue University said: \u201cWe\nwanted to see if fish responded to\npotentially painful stimuli in a reflexive way or a more clever way.\u201d To test\nthese pain responses, the researchers attached small foil heaters to two\ngroups of goldfish and slowly increased\nthe temperature. Half of the fish were\ninjected with pain-killing morphine\nand the others received saline solution.\nThe scientists expected the mor-phine-injected fish to withstand higher\ntemperatures before reacting. However, both groups of fish showed an\ninitial response by wriggling at about\nthe same temperature, leading the researchers to believe that the responses\nwere involuntary reflex actions rather\nthan cognitive reactions to pain.\nBut when the researchers later observed the fish in their home tanks,\nthey noticed that the two groups exhibited different behaviours. The\nmorphine-injected fish acted normally\nas they had before the experiment but\nthe saline-injected fish acted with defensive behaviours, indicating fear and\nanxiety.\nArt naturally\nLandscape has been a subject in art for\ncenturies. Two upcoming exhibitions\nexplore a modern-day take on this\ntheme, addressing human interaction\nwith the environment.\nTate Britain shows a major retrospective of works by the contemporary English sculptor and painter Richard Long\n(Richard Long \u2013 Heaven and Earth, 3\nJune \u2013 6 September 2009). Long\u2019s work\nis based around the solitary walks that\nhe makes through remote landscapes\nof Britain, Mongolia or Bolivia. During these walks he leaves marks behind\n\u2013 traces in the snow, trails of crushed\ngrass, or circles of stones - and records\nthese with photographs, maps or texts.\nFor Long, walking is a means to explore\nrelationships between time, distance,\ngeography and measurement. Each\nof his walks is also led by a particular\nidea. Nowhere, a straight line in a grass\nfield denotes the direction of Long\u2019s\nown path. A line in Scotland, a row of\nstone slates reminiscent of pre-history\nmonuments, traces the footprints of\nour ancestors. Long\u2019s work can also\nbe given another topical meaning. The\nmarks that he makes do not cause any\ndamage to nature, yet they interfere.\nNo matter how much we take care of\nthe environment, we will always leave\nour traces behind. The exhibition at\nTate Britain will show photographs, as\nArmies of super-soldiers, selected on\nthe basis of genetic make-up and constantly monitored for weaknesses. It\nmay sound like something from the\nrealms of science fiction but a report\nby the US National Academy of Science claims advances in science, especially neuroscience, could make superhuman soldiers a reality.\nPublished last week and funded by\nthe US army, the report gives a revealing insight into what science the\nmilitary could be funding in the future.\nFocusing on areas of science deemed\n\u201chigh-payoff\u201d \u2013 reliable enough to turn\ninto useful technologies, the report\nfeatures images not dissimilar from\nStar Wars\u2019 Stormtroopers.\nHowever, many of the proposals\nbring up ethical issues. Descriptions\nof biosensors warning both soldiers\nand command of potential weaknesses\ncan be countered with sinister images\nof robotic individuals programmed to\nbecome kamikaze assassins. Worries\nalso surround the potential discrimination of using genetic tests to decide\nwhich individuals are best suited to\nwhich jobs.\nAlthough Zak Paul, one of the neuroscientists on the reports research panel\nemphasized they were not looking at\nmaking \u201ckilling machines\u201d, his own research focuses on the role of oxytocin\nin empathy and trust. \u201cThere are lots\nof stories of soldiers who refuse to\nshoot other soldiers,\u201d says Zak. \u201cIf you\ncould get rid of that empathy response\nArmy of Super Soldiers\nwell as sculptures and paintings made\nfrom mud, stones and wood.\nRadical Nature \u2013 Art and Architecture for a Changing Planet 1969 \u2013\n2009, at the Barbican Art Gallery in\nLondon (19 June \u2013 18 October 2009)\nlooks at the landscape endangered\nthrough urbanisation and climate\nchange. Designed as a fantastical garden the exhibition shows installations,\nsculptures, films and photographs that\nhave emerged out of environmental\nactivism and experimental architecture over the last forty years. Some of\nthe exhibits politicise our relationship\nwith nature.

Buckminster Fuller,\nan experimental landscape architect\nconcerned with sustainability and re-cycling, envisioned that these domes\ncould be used to shield entire build-ings, sections of cities or even to create\nairborne metropolises that would float\nlike balloons.\nGarner said: \u201cThe fact that their behaviour changed so much really strongly suggests there is something going on\nwith their memory and experience of\nthat event that is not a reflex.

Whilst\nthe human varieties thrived at both 37\u00b0\nCelsius, our core body temperature,\nand at 32\u00b0 Celsius, the avian viruses\ncould only grow well at 37\u00b0 Celsius.\nProfessor Wendy Barclay, one of the\nauthors of the study from the Division\nof Investigative Science at Imperial\nCollege said:\n\u201cIt would be impossible to develop\nvaccines against all 16 subtypes of\navian flu, so we need to prioritise. By\nstudying a range of different viruses\nin systems like this one we can look\nfor warnings that they are already beginning to make the kinds of genetic\nchanges in nature that mean they\ncould be poised to jump into humans;\nanimal viruses that spread well at low\ntemperatures in these cultures could\nbe more likely to cause the next pandemic than those which are restricted.\u201d\nRead Jacob\u2019s other stories on:\nwww.justatheory.co.uk\nIs bird flu harmless to humans?\nDeadly super soldiers of the future \u2013 seem less scary now?\nyou might create a soldier that\u2019s more\nprepared to engage in battle and risk\ntheir life.\u201d.\nBut the report does not just focus\non improving a soldiers abilities as a\ncombatant, new technologies could\nalso save lives. Knowing which soldiers are more susceptible to stress\ncould limit or prevent combat stress\nreactions from battle. Monitoring attentiveness could reduce errors in the\nfield, and brain imaging could show\nwhether training had been understood\nby recruits.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got feelings too! Not to mention sole...\u201d\nnow forced to defend a point of view\nhe does not hold. The utter lack of\nserious evidence for any of the BCA\u2019s\nclaims is now irrelevant to the case,\nand will not be examined in court.\nIt is essential that journalists and\nscientists, especially (but not exclu-sively) those in medicine and health\ncare, be allowed to speak their mind\nand discuss the evidence without fear\nof litigation.\nThis libel action is not any form of\nrebuttal of Singh\u2019s claims: in fact, it\u2019s\na straightforward attempt to gag him,\nto prevent the airing of any criticism\nor debate about their beloved therapy.\nIf successful, the case may set a precedent allowing all sorts of dubious, unproven or downright fraudulent practices to flourish in the UK, safe in the\nknowledge that the courts will protect\nwhat little reputation they may have\nfrom critical analysis.\nSingh and his legal team announced\nat a public meeting last week that they\nare currently investigating the feasibility of an appeal. It is in all our interests\nthat he is successful.\nFor updates, join the Facebook support group or subscribe to legal blog-ger, Jack of Kent, who has been following the trial.\nKatherine Goates\nLouisa Garnier\nIsabelle Kaufmann\nI,science\nYou can follow I,science on facebook and Twitter!\nKeep up-to-date with science at Imperial, from the students\u2019 point of view.\nFacebook: I, science (media group)\nTwitter: twitter.com/I_Science_mag\nUFO landing sites aren\u2019t as high-tech as you might have thought\n\n"
