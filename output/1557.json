First off, it\nwas the first time the prize had been\nshared between the director (Abdel-latif Kechiche) and the lead actors\n(Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos and L\u00e9a Seydoux); and then the author of Le Bleu\nest une Couleur Chaude, the graphic\nnovel upon which the film is based,\nlabelled the graphic sex scenes, one of\nwhich exceeds 10 minutes in length,\npornographic; and then the lead actors stated that they would never work\nwith the director, claiming the working conditions were completely ter-rible; and then Kechiche questioned\nwhether the film\u2019s release should be\ncancelled. Oh, and the film was also\nbanned in Idaho - but perhaps that is\nunsurprising when the subject matter\nis considered.\nBlue is the Warmest Colour revolves\naround the relationship between teenager Ad\u00e8le (Exarchopoulos) and art\nschoolstudentEmma(Seydoux),afree\nspirit with wild blue hair that becomes\na centrepiece of the film. A three-hour\nlong epic, the plot spans a number of\nyears, as we watch the relationship\nbuild, climax, and finally crumble.\nBeautifully shot, the first hour looks at\nAd\u00e8le\u2019s existence as a typical teenager;\nengrossed with French literature, and\nwith ambitions to become a teacher,\nAd\u00e8le spends her time gossiping with\nher friends, eating in front of the TV,\nand having unsatisfying sex with her\nboyfriend, before she spots Emma one\nday while out in the city. After fanta-sising about having sex with her, Adele\nseems consigned to the fact that they\nwill never meet, but when out at a gay\nbar with her friend, they have a chance\nencounter that marks the beginning of\na whirlwind romance.\nInviting comparisons to Before Sunrise and In the Mood for Love, Blue is\nthe Warmest Colour excels at showing the tenderness and beauty of first\nlove. Walks through the park; visits\nto art galleries; picnics on the grass.\nAll these are captured sumptuously,\nand the relationship is seen as warm,\npeaceful, and serene. But it is not long\nbefore stormclouds begin to loom,\nand both characters must face problems with their friends, family, and\neach other.\nOne of the key features of the film,\nthat most critics referenced, are the\nextended, extremely graphic, lesbian\nsex scenes. Stretching into minutes,\nthese seem to make the audience noticeably uncomfortable; about halfway\nthrough the first one, which breaks\nthe 10 minute mark, and a rash of\nnervous giggling breaks out. Kechiche\nhas stated that his intention was not\nto make the viewers feel uncomfort-able, but rather to break down conventions of cinema, and this film\ncertainly seems like a watershed mo-ment. However, as well as questions\nof artistic value, these scenes raise the\nissue of the Male Gaze in cinema; can\na heterosexual man ever capture such\nrelationships without somewhat distorting them? Julie Maroh, the author\nof the original graphic novel doesn\u2019t\nthink so, calling it \u2018a brutal and surgical display, exuberant and cold, of socalled lesbian sex, which turned into\nporn\u2019. But perhaps this is too harsh;\nKechiche certainly seems to have a\nlevel of self awareness in the scenes\nwhen the couple are visiting galleries.\nThe camera lingers on images of naked women, of buttocks and breasts,\nthat are themselves products of the\nmale gaze, as opposed to some kind of\nsapphic icon. It seems like the director\nwas fully prepared for this to become a\ntalking point for the film, and reflects\nit in his work\nBut once the controversy and graphic content have been scraped away, we\nare left with very realistic, very natural\ninteractions between the characters;\nAd\u00e8le, comparing herself to Emma\u2019s\narty friends, begins to see herself as\nuncultured and ignorant, an idea\nthat is further enforced by the family\ndinners we are shown. When Ad\u00e8le\ndines at Emma\u2019s house they are all\ncompletely open, eating shellfish and\ndrinking fine wine, but when Emma\nvisits Ad\u00e8le she must do so under\nthe pretense of helping her with phi-losophy, and talk about her \u2018boyfriend\u2019\nwhile being served a much more humble meal of spaghetti. As Ad\u00e8le begins\nher career as a teacher, Emma repeatedly tries to get her to better herself;\n\u2018I just don\u2019t want you to be sad\u2019 Emma\nsays, \u2018I\u2019m not sad; not when I\u2019m with\nyou\u2019 replies Ad\u00e8le.\nThings don\u2019t stay happy forever;\nEmma reverts back to her natural\nblonde locks, reflecting the shifting\nnature of the relationship, and towards the last 40 minutes of the film,\nExarchopoulos\u2019 performance becomes\na visceral tour de force; heartbroken,\ntears and snot stream down her face,\nwhich displays every flicker of emo-tion. Exarchopoulos, along with Seydoux, are both incredibly gifted ac-tors, and their magnetic presence on\nscreen propel this journey to its final\nBlue is the Warmest\nColour\nDirector: Abdellatif Kechiche\nWriters: Julie Maroh (comic),\nAbdellatif Kechiche, Abdellatif\nKechiche, Ghalia Lacroix\nStarring: Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, L\u00e9a\nSeydoux\nRuntime: 179 minutes\nCertification: 18\nFred Fyles\nWriter\ndestination.\nA gifted director. Incredible leading\nroles. A hint of controversy. It all adds\nup to a blisteringly emotional epic,\nthat was a worthy winner at Cannes.\nPassionate, ground-breaking, and\nbeautiful, Blue is the Warmest Colour\nis most certainly one of the best films\nof the festival.\n\n"

This\nyear over 27% of students voted for their\nUnion Council representatives, academic\nrepresentatives and Liberation o\ufb03cers. The\nfun doesn\u2019t stop here, now it\u2019s time to watch\nthe elected candidates and see how they\nperform during the year. Congratulations to\nthose who won, and commiserations to those\nthat didn\u2019t make it, better luck next time.\nThe \ufb01rst session of Union Council is this\nTuesday, so if you\u2019re curious about what\nCouncil does, why not turn up? All members\nof the Union are welcome to attend and the\ncurrent papers are about topics such as the\nHyde Park Football pitches consultation and\nthe Union\u2019s stance on the new Immigration\nBill. If there\u2019s something else you think\nshould be discussed, submit a paper! Any full\nmember of the Union can submit a paper to\nCouncil, so don\u2019t be shy!\nFinally, this week saw the graduation of\nanother batch of Imperial students, a large\ncontingent of fussy parents and a long\nqueue for photography in the Beit Quad!\nCongratulations to the Class of 2013, as well\nas the students and members of sta\ufb00 that\nwere presented awards. As for the rest of us,\nat least now we know that if we see any other\npeople walking around campus in gowns this\nyear, they are either Postgraduate graduands\nor members of the Harry Potter society!\nJoseph Letts\nEditor-in-Chief\nOf Commemoration\nand Elections\nLetters\nDear Felix Editor,\nI am replying to the outrageous letter, printed\nlast issue, by the obviously irresponsible\nindividual named the Druid. His plea to\nintroduce the most poisonous substance,\nnamely ice cream, into the Union bar shows\nincredible ignorance on his part. Does he not\nknow how many deaths yearly are attributed to\nthe abuse of frozen sugar? These are induced\nby horrible diseases, foremost among them\nbrain freeze, from which I have su\ufb00ered on\nmany occasions. I wish this notorious felon\nto apologise to all those victims who have\nsu\ufb00ered ice cream related accidents, and\nretract his request for this poison to be served.\nThe Paladin\nP.S. At least we agree that there shouldn\u2019t be\nany of that froyo or sorbet shit.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON\nGot something to\nsay? Write in!\n\n"

It\u2019s not so\nmuch a marathon as a Himalayan expedition:\nthe glory isn\u2019t in coming \ufb01rst, or writing\nmore than anyone else\u2026 it\u2019s just in crossing\nthat 50,000 word line.\nWhile \u2018quality over quantity\u2019 is a \ufb01ne motto\nfor many things in life, it\u2019s also what paralyses\nmany would-be writers, who agonise over\nopening sentences and \ufb01rst chapters,\ndeleting and re-writing until they give up,\nstill far, far away from having a completed\nnovel - a process which I\u2019m sure is familiar\nto many of you.\nThe NaNoWriMo philosophy is to write\nwithout looking back: a rough novel can be\nedited, polished and perfected; there\u2019s not\nmuch that can be done with a blank page.\nIn the words of Ernest Hemingway, \u201cthe \ufb01rst\ndraft of anything is shit.\u201d It\u2019s creating this\nshitty \ufb01rst draft that NaNoWriMo is about:\nthe ability to let go of perfectionism, ignore\nthe thoughts telling you to give up and start\nagain; to just let the words \ufb02ow.\nStarting in 1999 with just 21 participants,\nthe following year saw over 5,000 people\ntaking part. The event quickly boomed in\npopularity. It is NaNoWriMo\u2019s supportive\ncommunity - and the chance of becoming\na recognised winner - that make the event\ndi\ufb00erent from a solitary, self-motivated\nwriting challenge. As well as real-life meet-ups, there are forums for discussion of the\nintricacies of plot and characterisation,\ncompetitive \u2018word wars\u2019 and other\nproductivity games, as well as motivational\nadvice.\nIf, like me, you\u2019ve always dreamed of being\nan author but always put it o\ufb00 until \u2018one day\u2019\n,\nNaNoWriMo is your chance. I\u2019m taking part\nfor the \ufb01rst time this year, joining hundreds\nof thousands of others, including regulars.\nOne chemistry student, who has participated\nbefore,says,\u201cIwanttobeawriter,andforcing\nyourself to write is a good way to start. I\u2019d\nfound it by reputation a dozen times on the\ninternet over the years, but didn\u2019t actually\ntake part until I was 18. I got out of it two\nvery poorly written books, and the promise\nof more to come.\u201d\nThe event begins next Friday. If you have\na writer\u2019s itch that needs scratching, sign\nup, get planning, stock up on paper, pens,\nbooze or whatever you need. It\u2019s tough, but\nafter thirty days you\u2019ll be one of a special\nfew: you\u2019ll be able to look down upon your\ncompleted novel and say, \u201cI wrote that.\u201d\n\u201cIn the world according to Garp, we are\nall terminal cases. \u201c This motif, recurring\nmultiple times throughout the novel, is\nperhaps somewhat overdramatised, yet\npainfully accurate. From the first page\nthrough to the last one, the reader is\ninfected with the subtle anticipation\nthat the characters are inevitably\napproaching something horrible.\nSomething tremendous, something that\nwill change everything, forever: An\nintangible danger; a monster introduced\ninto the storyline by Garp\u2019s young son\nWalt. He misunderstands his parents\nwarning him of the undertow along the\nshore, and how it can \u201cPull you under,\nsuck you out to sea\u201d, and one day Walt\nstares fiercely toward the ocean, looking\nfor the Under Toad (\u201cHow big is it? What\ncolour is it? How fast can it swim?\u201d).\nThe novel, with all its quirks, makes\nit incredibly easy to dip into the story,\nbecome part of it, and laugh and cry with\nthe characters. The fear that whatever\nyou take for granted in one part of the\nnovel might suddenly be ripped away\nfrom you and torn into pieces as you\nread on, makes you want to put it down\ninstantly, as if that could change its\noutcome \u2013 but you can\u2019t. It is the kind\nof story that makes you want to stop the\nclocks when you are sitting in the Tube\non your way to Uni, knowing that your\nstop is next and you will have to close\nthe book.\nI have to say though, whilst reading it,\nI did not always think I would praise it\nto that extent. Not necessarily because\nit takes a few pages to fully immerse\nin the storyline (it doesn\u2019t), but rather\nbecause parts of it are deeply disturbing.\nRanging from people biting off other\npeople\u2019s genitalia, over children losing\neyes, arms and tongues, to women\nraping disabled, dying men in hospital\nto impregnate themselves \u2013 Irving\u2019s\ngot them all. Of course, \u201cA novelist is a\ndoctor who sees only terminal cases.\u201d\nIn a way, this is a novelist writing\na novel about a novelist writing\nnovels. It approaches literature from\na very personal point of view, which is\nespecially fascinating if you yourself are\ninterested in writing.\nAs if he knows how personal a\nrelationship the reader forms with his\nnovel, Irving mentions towards the end:\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry - so what if there is no life\nafter death? There is life after Garp,\nbelieve me.\u201d Unfortunately, I cannot\nyet confirm that this is true, since I am\nstill getting over this book like normal\npeople are getting over a lover after a\ntough break up. I thought what we had\nwas special, and I didn\u2019t want it to end\nso soon \u2013 which is why I immediately\ngot myself some more Irving from the\nbookshop!\nTake nothing for granted\nIsabelle Erbacher\nWriter\nSend your submissions for\nour newest regular fea-tures!\nFLASH FICTION: Ultrashort\nfiction up to 200 characters\nSTUDENT PICKS: Send us up\nto 250 words on your favourite book and how it changed\nyou\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nKeir Little thinks that you should know\nStudent Picks\nNeil Gaiman is a well-known and prolific author.\nHis creative range is impressive \u2013 having written\nboth science fiction and fantasy, authored numerous\nbooks and graphic novels, and worked on both films\nand TV shows. However, if there is one theme that is\na near constant presence in his creative output it is\nthe exploration of myths and legends in their many\ndifferent forms. There is nowhere where this is more\nobvious than in his Nebula and Hugo award winning\nnovel American Gods.\nThe novel\u2019s protagonist is Shadow, a recently released\nconvict who finds out that his wife was killed in a\ncar accident a few days before his release.

Re\ufb02ektor was announced in a reply to a\nsingle fan on twitter, it\u2019s\nbeen preceded with a viral campaign\ninspired by Haitian veve drawings\n(me neither) and a single credited to a\n\ufb01ctional band called The Re\ufb02ektors.\nThe hipster darlings are doing nothing to alleviate accusations of preten-siousness. However, even as a massive\nfan, much of this has passed me by.\nI\u2019m \ufb01nding it really hard to get myself\nexcited about the new album. Back in\n2010, when The Suburbs was released,\nI remember having it pre-ordered\nfrom within hours of the release date\nbeing announced. I remember it arriving and me listening to nothing else\nfor about 3 days. This time around, I\u2019d\nforgotten it was even out until a couple of days ago. What went wrong?\nA few years on, it does certainly\nseem like my furious replays of The\nSuburbs were perhaps a little over the\ntop. It was certainly a very good al-bum. Highly rated by critics and fans\nalike, it saw Arcade Fire catapulted\ninto the mega-big-time. They won the\nalbum of the year Grammy and headlined some of the biggest festivals in\nthe world. Despite all this, and I don\u2019t\nthink this is just me, it just wasn\u2019t\nquite there. Funeral will always be one\nof my all time favourite albums.\nThere is not a song\non there I haven\u2019t\nbeen completely\nobsessed with at\none point or an-other. The two\nthat followed it\nwere never going\nto live up to that.\nThe darker, more\nintimate Neon\nBible was a fascinating listen, if\nnot a particularly\neasy one. The Suburbs was as easy\nto listen to as the\ncatchier moments\non the debut, but\nnowhere near as\nmemorable, and\nde\ufb01nitely a few tracks too long. A\nwide variety of styles was met with\na single happier tone that hasn\u2019t ever\nmanaged to leave its mark on me. In\nhindsight, it seemed a bit like Arcade\nFire by numbers, which whilst good,\ndidn\u2019t exactly blow me away.\nThere is, of course, lots to be excited about with the record. Producing credits go to James Murphy of\nLCD Soundsystem fame (alongside\nregular producer Markus Dravs),\nwhich is most de\ufb01nitely an exciting\nA\nswitch up. There\u2019s a heavy disco in\ufb02uence on \ufb01rst single, Re\ufb02ektor, which is\na brave new direction for Arcade Fire.\nIt\u2019s also an absolutely banging track.\nThe rest of the songs released from\nthe new album all have a bit of an 80s\nin\ufb02uence, although none of it sounds\ntoo samey. In fact, all of the new tracks\nsound superb. However, they all lack\nany orchestral elements. There\u2019s no\nhorns, no strings, no hurdy-gurdy.\nThis isn\u2019t Arcade Fire by numbers, this\ndoesn\u2019t even sound that much like Arcade Fire. The idea of mixing 80s pop\nwith indie rock might be new ground\nfor Arcade Fire, but it isn\u2019t exactly new\nground for modern music. In fact, it is\nthe legacy of James Murphy. Funeral\nwas one of the most important albums\nin recent years. There are countless\nbands who tried to imitate that sound,\nnone of whom managed it.

In the 19th Century two greats gave fundamentally opposing views.\nArthurSchopenhauer,whothoughttheworldaroundusamererepresentation\nof reality, believed Art could reveal its true nature. He argued that music alone\ncould completely express the world \u2018in itself\u2019 as it was not representative of\nanything. Friedrich Nietzsche accorded Art an even greater status. To him, life\nis devoid of meaning or order, save for that which Man creates. Art is therefore\nnot a means to better understand the world, but a metaphysical way of giving\nmeaning to it.\n\"The world is a work of art that gives birth to itself.\"\n\u2013 Nietzsche, The Will to Power\nIt is often difficult to apply these theories. In the last century provocateurs such\nasMarcel DuchampandJohn CagehaveforcedustoaskourselveswhatisArt?\nIs an unmade bed a work of art if it is placed in a gallery? Is there an aesthetic\nline to be drawn between the latest Hollywood blockbuster and an \u201cart-house\u201d\n\ufb01lm? Finally, does such a line exist between the works of Beethoven and Justin\nBieber?\nIwon\u2019tpretendtoknowtheanswerhere.InsteadIwouldliketodiscusswithyou\na tradition in music that for me personally comes closest to the aesthetic ideals\nof the philosophers, or at the very least is most engaged in the discussion. This\ntradition has rather\npresumptively been\ncalled \u2018Art\u2019 music or\n\u2018serious\u2019 music but\nis most commonly\nknown as \u2018Classical\u2019\nmusic. This title is\nused mistakenly, but\nI will continue to\nuse it for the sake of\nsimplicity.\nWith the advent\nof recording\ntechnology in the\n20th Century the\nlines between the\nvarious musical\ntraditions blurred\nconsiderably, but I\nbelieve there to be\none crucial distinction between classical music and the other traditions (such\nas pop and folk). This is the fact that it is a literate tradition. Folk music is\norally transmitted, and pop music is primarily transmitted through recorded\nmedia (though it is true some is notated later by others), but classical music\nhas always been written. This is a crucial fact as it has allowed the music to be\nanalysed and hence developed over the millennium or so since the invention of\nmusical notation. Furthermore, freedom from the limits of human memory has\nallowed works to be written longer and with greater complexity.\nOver the past 1000 years this Western tradition has seen highs and lows, and\nexplored many style and genres, but importantly continues to adapt to the\nmodern world and may now be at a richer and more exciting stage than ever\nbefore.Audiencesarelargerthaneverandcontinuetowitnesstheregeneration\nof old works while composers are continually experimenting and pushing the\nboundaries of sound and Art. Over the coming months I hope to present to\nyou an easy introduction and exploration of this rich tradition. We will take a\nchronological look at some of the major ideas and trends and perhaps analyse\nin depth some of the key masterpieces of the repertoire. In the next instalment\nI will explore the fascinating music of the of Middle Ages and their roots in\nAncient Greece.\nREFLEKTOR\nEpisode 1: What is Art?\nEmiel de Lange\n\n"

Having moved\naway from the more conventional but\nalways distinctive ambient he used to\nproduce towards a more readily accessible style in recent releases like\n2011\u2019s Replica, he has still managed to\nkeep his distinctive style throughout.\nTim Hecker has similarly popularised\nthe likes of drone, with albums like\nprevious full length Ravedeath, 1972\nbecoming favourites in recent alternative music.\nIt is his subsequent EP, however,\nthat really proves the best starting point here. Dropped Pianos, of\ncourse a play on \u2018The Piano Drop\u2019, o\ufb00\nRavedeath, consists of several short\nsketches of piano experimentation\nfrom Hecker. It provides a natural\ncompanion piece to Ravedeath which\nwas interestingly recorded before Ravedeath. Dropped Pianos was seen as\ncold and stark but for my money it\ndistils some of Hecker\u2019s more terrifying moments into the more restrained\nmedium of piano.\nThis is an approach that\u2019s seemingly been incorporated into Virgins,\nhis fourth full-length album released\non Kranky. Opening track \u2019Prism\u2019 balances dissonance, melody and pulsating drones in a way wouldn\u2019t be too\nout of place on earlier releases such\nas Harmony In Ultraviolet, and his\nfamiliar sound is present particularly\nsome organ work reminiscient of Ravedeath, 1972. In amongst all of this,\nhowever, is the appearance of new el-ements, such as the piano work which\naccompanies the more conventional\nand experimental elements and at\ntimes recalls early minimalism such\nas Philip Glass or Charlemagne Palestine. There is even a greater presence of wind instruments for example\nin \u2018Live Room,\u2019 as well as some rather\nface melting bassy noise clicks. The\nnoise is made even more hard hitting\nby the more melodic repetitive back-ground. Most people will probably\nthink that calling this noise is a slight\noverstatement, and I would say that\u2019s\na fair point. I would also say, though\nthat the work approaches noise, but\nit\u2019s blended with melody in a similar\nmanner to Norwegian band Puma.\nThis is certainly Hecker\u2019s most eclectic release to date, with moments\nsimilar to Fennesz (\u2018Stigmata I\u2019) and\nOneohtrix Point Never (\u2018Virginal II\u2019).\nThe view that Tim Hecker is similar to\nOneohtrix is a widely acknowledged\nT\nopinion, but I actually think last year\u2019s\ncollaboration \u2013 Instrumental Tourist,\nshowed a real contrast between their\nstyles which were elegantly blended\ntogether. Perhaps it isn\u2019t going too\nfar to suggest that Hecker has been\nin\ufb02uenced by his Brooklyn based col-laborator.\nDaniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point\nNever), in his latest e\ufb00ort, R Plus\nSeven, continues in the direction of\nhis previous album, Replica \u2013 moving\nfrom ambient into more poppy, less\nabstract, melodic sounds. This may\nsound derisory, but he has stepped\ninto this territory in a novel way, with\ntracks like \u2018Americans\u2019 resembling\nsound collage and as such it could\nbe argued that a still unmistakably\ndistinctive Lopatin is exploring more\naccessible grounds through an experimental approach of sound collage and\nsampling.\nIn fact, a lot of \u2018Zebra\u2019 would \ufb01t\nin pretty comfortably with Replica,\nalbeit with some jazzy textures mixed\nin. There is however a wealth of diverse textures and it\u2019s certainly more\neclectic than Virgins. In my opinion\nthe most prominent feature is Lopatin\u2019s manipulation of vocal samples,\nin a way not dissimilar to Battles on\ntheir debut album Mirrored, generally in conjunction with subtle e\ufb00ects\nand a pretty chilled out vibe all things\nconsidered. Tracks like \u2018He She\u2019 are\nadmittedly a little hard to take on the\n\ufb01rst listen, a disjointed cacophony of\nalmost Enya-esque vocal samples,\nbut through this rather unusual component he manages to create soundscapes which both thrill and please,\ntaking a previously used element to its\nlogical extreme yet making the result\nrather comforting in a strange way.\nA great example of this is \u2018Along,\u2019\nat times reminiscient of Hyperrealism such as Noah Creshevsky,\nwho uses vocal and other samples\nin a way that exaggerates them. No\nanalysis would be complete without\nconsidering Lopatin\u2019s synth work.\nTracks like \u2018Problem Areas\u2019 almost\nsuggest the in\ufb02uence of dance music in a much more obvious way than\nI\u2019ve heard from him before. Not to\nmention that, but the extremely relaxing and mildly cathartic closer\n\u2018Chrome Country\u2019 has some evocative synth lines reminiscient of\nPanabrite or some of the other excellent space rock inspired electronic acts on VCO. The album ends in\ntypically strange form, with a rather\nevocative organ \ufb02ourish.\nBoth Oneohtrix and Hecker have\ndistinctive musical voices and seemingly both have managed to bring\nnew dimensions into their music,\ncreating fascinating records, mixing\ncomfort with discomfort and creating albums that are evolutionary\nrather than rehashing past glories.\nAs is often said, however, the more\nthings change, the more the stay the\nsame and in both Virgins and R Plus\nSeven, new ground is covered while\nstill retaining their unique musical\nidentities.\nR Plus Seven was released on September\n30th on Warp Records, Virgins is to be\nreleased on Kranky on October 14th.\n\n"

    "content": "24 FRIDAY 25 OCT\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLiz & Dick\nLiz Taylor and Dick Bu\nJohn Park Television Editor\nThey first meet on the set of Cleopatra,\nwhere the married Dick (Grant Bowler) tries to pass the married Liz (Lind-say Lohan) a flirty compliment based\non her ravishing looks. But this instead backfires and the pair are off to\na rocky start. She thinks he\u2019s a snobby\nEnglish man who looks down on all\nthings American and female, he thinks\nshe\u2019s a young American bimbo who\ndoesn\u2019t know a thing about the acting\nprocess. But it would appear that opposites attract and soon they become\nan inseparable item. Their whirlwind\naffair becomes a worldwide sensation,\nwith even the Vatican catching a whiff\nof their forbidden love affair and condemning their \u201cerotic vagrancy\u201d since\nthey were both married.\nAlcohol and addiciton also play a\ncentral role in the couple\u2019s dynamic.\nThe two of them love their drinks, and\nhardly a day goes by when they don\u2019t\npour themselves whiskey or vodka\nin large glasses that they proceed to\ndown in one gulp.\nHow Lifetime managed to produce such a bland, clunky dramatic\nportrayal of one of the most famous\ncouples in the planet is atrociously\nappalling. The casting directors (yes,\nthere were more than one getting paid\nto work on this department) must all\nhave been possessed or on something\nwhen they decided to offer Lohan the\npart. Lohan is not as bad an actress as\neveryone may think she is, but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean she can handle the role\nof an acting legend. And it\u2019s her performance at the heart of the film that\ncompletely falls to pieces. A lot of\npeople were shocked when they heard\nthe news of Lohan\u2019s casting - and they\nwere right to be.\nIt looks as though she\u2019s not even\ntrying; she huffs and puffs through\nher dialogue as if reciting every word\non her script without really understanding what is happening around\nher, and she doesn\u2019t even come close\nto embodying Taylor. The make-up,\nhair and costume departments have\nall done wonders here, trying to replicate Taylor\u2019s exact, iconic looks, but\nthe woman wearing the dresses, the\njewellery, the wigs, is simply not up\nfor the challenge. One particularly\nmemorable moment of unintentional\nhilarity is Lohan\u2019s Taylor\u2019s reaction to\nthe news of Richard Burton\u2019s sudden\ndeath. It\u2019s so amateurish that this is the\ncomedic highlight of the film. Lohan\ntrying to somehow act out the role of\nMartha in Taylor\u2019s most famous film\nWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is one\nhideously offensive tribute moment\nthat more than taints the excellent\nfilm\u2019s legacy. It feels as though Lohan\nis performing a half-hearted comedic\nsketch - a parody of Elizabeth Taylor\nwhich is supposed to be funny.\nGrant Bowler fares better in com-parison, and it\u2019s only him who walks\naway with some level of dignity intact.\nThe volatile, alcoholic Burton is entertaining to watch at times, but even he\ncan\u2019t salvage this near 90-minute ordeal that sets out to do far more than\nwhat it can actually handle.\nThe film attempts to squeeze in as\nmany events as possible. First the\nmeeting, all the way up to Richard\nBurton\u2019s death; that\u2019s around 20 years\nof content, a hefty number of events as\nthe lovers went back and forth, went\nthrough two marriages, and a host of\ndifferent lovers. Liz & Dick stretches\nitself too thin, and never explores the\njuicy drama any further than stating\nsome vague facts about the characters hoping the audience will catch up\non their lives through the many time\njumps.\nIt has a thing or two to say about the\nlife of a celebrity; at the centre of the\nconstant spotlight of the world\u2019s at-tention, it\u2019s difficult to lead a normal\nlife, and privacy is a luxury you can\u2019t\nafford. The paparazzi are relentless in\ntheir pursuit of their snaps, although\nLohan struggles to show even a hint of\nanger or frustration at this which isn\u2019t\nall that surprising given the long list of\nwhat the actress has not been able to\ndo in the rest of the film.\nThe presentation in a way that interchanges between moving forward\nwith the main story, and one that finds\nus in a dimly-lit interview room where\nTaylor and Burton are interviewed in\na bizarre, fictional afterlife-type setting as they look back on their history,\nis one that is confused and requires\nLohan to speak more than necessary.\nThey reflect on their actions, explain\nthemselves, and it\u2019s clear the point of\nsuch segments was to provide some\nsort of psychological insight into their\nbehaviour and decisions. And yet\nthis approach tediously slows down\nthe film considerably, and it\u2019s not as\nthough what they have to share directly with the audience is anything\nground-breaking.\nHere is something that will no doubt\ngive you a good laugh, almost all of\nit stemming from Lohan\u2019s god-awful\nportrayal of a two-time Oscar winner.\n\n"

    "content": "9\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 25 OCT\nCOMMENT\nKelly-vison\nWith the unsurprising news that Higgs\nand French physicist Englert were\nawardedthe2013NobelPrizeinPhysics,\nI feel that I can indulge in cross-subject\nchauvinism. No other prizewinner\nthis year will be given for something\nof such profound importance. The\nmost important Chemistry prize was\nRutherford... who was a physicist.\nWe need to think of the limitations of\nthese prizes. There\u2019s the lack of gender\nequity in awarding prizes unilaterally\nbeyond the sciences, keeping women\nout for much of their history. Likewise\nin literature, which recognised some\ngreat female authors by the start of\nthe 20th century. The percentage of\nwomen awarded the Nobel Prize in\nPhysics comes somewhere between\nthe percentage of women in parliament\nin Oman and Yemen, the latter having\nthe dubious honour of being lowest in\nthe IPU\u2019s list. I might suggest that the\nvisibility of women on the Nobel Prize\nwebsite does not function to \u2018promote\u2019\nwomen. It covers up the Committee\u2019s\npast promotion of iniquity.\nPhysicists like to imagine that Physics\nand politics are two separate worlds.\nThe inadequacy of this attitude became\nclear to me upon visiting Hiroshima.\nTo tie the exalted heights of the\nNobel Prize to worldly \ufb01nance seems\nsacrilegious. Had Higgs and Englert\nnot won the prize, some non-scientists\nmay have asked questioned the point\nof the LHC. This isn\u2019t to belittle the\ninput into the theory, but note that\no\ufb03cial governmental attitudes follow\nthe devastating doctrine of the Bologna\nProcess, whose insistence on e\ufb03ciency\nand competitiveness should be seen as\na wholesale attack on education and\nresearch freedom. This is, to use idiotic\nphrases, \u201ca time of austerity\u201d\n.\nThere are other dubious points in\nthe Committee\u2019s history. A Literature\nPrize without Tolstoy seems suspect.\nIs there anything in Kawabata but what\norientalist racism makes of his work?\nA Peace Prize without Gandhi lacks all\ncredibility.\nThe Peace Prize is responsible for the\nmost farcical award for peace in history,\neven more so than the Confucius Peace\nPrize award to Putin a couple of years\nago. That is, of course, the joint award\nto Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho in\n1973. Le Duc Tho, honourably, refused\nthe prize. Kissinger \u2014 well known\nsponsor of military coups (Chile,\nArgentina) and avowed ally of Suharto\nof Indonesia, who not only led a corrupt\nand un-democratic regime, but also led\nIndonesia (with Kissinger\u2019s approval)\ninto invasion and mass criminal\nslaughter of the people of East Timor \u2014\ndid not.\nThere have been sensible awards; few\ncontest the awarding of the Peace Prize\nto Aung San Suu Kyii in 1991, and many\nwill acknowledge the heroism of likely\ncandidate Malala Yousafzai. It is hard to\naccept a Peace Prize awarded to those\nwho should be punished for war crimes.\nA prize bearing the name of a famous\narms dealer does not strike me as an\nendorsement for peace.\nA condition for open press is respect\nfor journalist protection. The \ufb01lm\nadaptation of the murder of the Balibo\nFive in East Timor suggests that the\ndeath of journalists is a su\ufb03ciently\nsparse phenomenon to warrant\nattention. The fact that I remember the\n2006 murder of Anna Politkovskaya\ndemonstrates that journalist deaths\nhave a certain impact superceding\ngeneral homicide. There aren\u2019t many\nthings government can do, short\nof eliminating reporters in order to\nrestrict press freedoms.\nConsider PEN International\u2019s report\non restrictions placed upon writers and\njournalists in China. PEN International\nis an international humanitarian\norganization campaigning for press\nfreedoms and writers\u2019 protections. It\nboasts a presidential list that reads like\na who\u2019s-who of 20th century literature;\n(Maurice Maeterlinck, Arthur Miller,\nMario Vargas Llosa and Imperial\nalumnus H. G. Wells, to name but a few.\nCurrent active members/supporters\ninclude Salman Rushdie and Margaret\nAtwood. The report, released on World\nPress Freedom Day, is a brief summary\nof coercive practices adopted by the\nChinese government to force consent\non writers and reporters. Ai Weiwei\nand Liu Xiaobo come to mind as\nvictims of these practices. The report\ndescribes cases of illegal imprisonment\nand torture used against dissident\nwriters and activists.\nChina is not the only guilty party in\nthis respect. The Committee to Protect\nJournalists (CPJ), an organization\nthat campaigns for press freedoms\njournalist-related crime, has recently\nreleased a damning report on the\nObama administration\u2019s alleged\nattempts to curtail the more subversive\nor investigative elements of the press.\nThe surprising thing that comes to\nlight is the repeated assertion by\njournalists that the administration is\nclosed and secretive, on par with the\nBush administration.\nWe shouldn\u2019t negate the threat to\njournalists\u2019 lives all over the globe.\nRussia has been notorious for the\nmortality rate of its journalists. There\nare many journalists whose deaths go\nunreported. Mick Deane, Sky News\nCameraman, was one of 39 journalists\nkilled this year given coverage in\nthe British media. This is why the\n\u2019innovative approach\u2019 that Belgian\nsecurity o\ufb03cers have taken to arrest\nSomali pirate leader Mohamed Abdi\nHassan is disturbing.\nE\ufb00ective as this operation may\nhave been in arresting leaders of\norganized crime, it demonstrates a\nlack of foresight and disturbing \u2018gungho\u2019 attitude on the part of security\no\ufb03cials. This has, according to a\nCPJ report, endangered the lives of\nreporters working in Somalia. With\n2012 being the deadliest year for\nreporters in Somalia on record, I hope\n2013 remains uneventful.\nHow Noble are the Nobel Prizes?\nReflections on Journalism\nDisagree?\nEmail us at\nWe air the\nway that\nChristy Kelly\nviews the\nworld.\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "6 FRIDAY 25 OCT\nEditors: Philippa Skett,\nKeir Little, Fiona Hartley\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSCIENCE\nSTEFAN SEIP (TWAN)\nHappy Felix Friday everybody. The week is nearly over and the weekend\nlooms. My favourite weekend activity is of course catching up on all of the\nsleep that I feel like I missed over the week, so today\u2019s page about slumber\nwas particularly interesting for me to put together. I\u2019m disappointed to\n\ufb01nd that cheese keeps you awake rather than merely causing you to have\nvivid dreams though, since I\u2019m partial to a slice or four of cheese on toast\nas a midnight snack.\nBut before we get distracted by the fascinating question of whether\neating Cheddar before bed makes you have nightmares, and the self-experimentation that is bound to follow, let me talk about the waking\nworld. It must have seemed like a very bad dream to the US researchers\nwho were unable to continue their work throughout the duration of the\nUS government shutdown. Fortunately they are now able to get back into\ntheir labs and begin the arduous process of getting back to normal, but for\nmany the consequences of those empty days won\u2019t be apparent until later.\nIn more local news, citizen science is back in the spotlight, because the\nconclusions from the BBC\u2019s Stress Test have been released. You might\nremember having taken the online test back in 2011. The BBC surveyed\nover thirty thousand individuals with the test, and Professor Peter\nKinderman from the University of Liverpool published the \ufb01ndings from\nthe data collected in PLOS One (doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0076564).\nIt doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to me that brooding is such a huge predictor\nof common mental health issues su\ufb00ered by the British public, such as\nanxiety and depression. My own experiences certainly compel me to\nagree. And it turns out that rumination \u2013 thinking too much \u2013 can be\neven more harmful than blaming oneself for negative events that happen\nin life.\nDr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist also involved in the study, believes\nthere is a good message to be taken home from the results. Knowing\nthat your problems are not just down to factors you can\u2019t alter is quite a\nhopeful thought. Yes, it\u2019s hard to change or be told that you should change\nfor your own bene\ufb01t, but at least you\u2019re not doomed. It\u2019s the message I\u2019ll\nbe musing on if I \ufb01nd myself thinking unhealthily.\nT\nhe 16 day US government\nshut-down ended last\nweek with an uneasy truce.\nObama\u2019s refusal to accept\nthe House Republican\u2019s\ncondition of delaying Obamacare led\nto the closure of many federal science\ninstitutions, painfully elucidating\nthe instability of government funded\nscience in America.\nThe full e\ufb00ects of the shutdown on\nthe scienti\ufb01c community will perhaps\nnever be known. The tangential\ninvestigations and light-bulb\nmoments of inspiration that bring\nbreak-throughs require momentum,\nand that has been lost. Overcoming\nthe inertia post shut-down will be\na long and di\ufb03cult process. But the\nimmediate impacts are obvious. Basic\nlab operations in cancer research and\nHIV were stopped and clinical trials\ncould not be initiated. The National\nInstitute of Health (NIH) were forced\nto turn away around 200 patients a\nweek awaiting treatment, roughly 30\nof whom were children. For those with\ndegenerative illnesses this delay could\ncause irreparable damage. Specially\nbred lab mice at the NIH needing\nconstant monitoring have died; these\nunique strains will be expensive and\ntime-consuming to restart. NASA\ncould not undertake vital checks on\nthe new James Webb Space Telescope\nwhich is set to replace Hubble, some\nof which may never be completed\nbefore launch. An environmental\nprogramme in the Antarctic has\nScientists go back to work\nJamie Rickman on the impact of the US shutdown\nmissed a crucial research window; it\u2019ll\nhave to wait another year.\nScienti\ufb01c research is never immune\nto ill circumstance; faulty equipment\nand bad conditions can similarly\ndisrupt progress, so one should\nperhaps be wary of sensationalising\nthe lasting e\ufb00ects of this moratorium.\nBut there is something deeply\nunsettling in the balance of power\nbetween scientists in the US and the\ngovernment who sign their checks.\n75% of NIH employers were\nsent home, or furloughed, with no\nguarantee of back pay. A source\ninside the NIH, warned against\nspeaking to the press, lamented the\ndemoralisation this caused in her lab\nfor those deemed \u2018inessential\u2019. For the\nmajority of workers on low pay and\n10-12 hour days this kind of \ufb01nancial\ninsecurity and lack of recognition is\nuntenable, forcing them to consider\n\ufb01nding work elsewhere. She explained\nthat her biggest frustration was that\nshe would rather have gone to work\nwithout pay and continue research\nthan let her mice die. During the\n1995 shutdown this was allowed,\nwhile last week it was illegal to check\nwork emails let alone enter a lab. This\nstrange and obtuse piece of legislation\nnot only expresses a \ufb02agrant\ndisregard for the value of science but\na fundamental misunderstanding\nof the way it operates. When it did\nenter the debate in Congress, the only\narguments that stood ground against\nthe tide of republican indi\ufb00erence\nreduced science to a political asset;\nthe lost time could mean the US\nlosing its competitive edge over\nChina for example. In this landscape\nof brinkmanship politics more\nshut-downs are expected, and the\ndamaging e\ufb00ects will be cumulative.\nSome would say the future of federally\nfunded science in the US looks bleak.\nT\nhe most distant example of\na gravitational lens has been\ndiscovered by scientists in\nGermany. The large galaxy,\n9.4 billion light years away\nfrom us, focuses light towards the\nearth, like a sort of cosmic telescope,\nenabling us to detect another smaller,\nmore distant galaxy that would\nnormally be too dim for us to pick\nup. But the unexpected discovery of\nthis smaller galaxy has puzzled the\nastronomers behind the research,\nat the Max Planck Institute for\nAstronomy in Heidelberg.\nGravitational lenses are a\nphenomenon predicted by Albert\nEinstein\u2019s general theory of relativity,\nwhich describes the way massive\nobjects change the shape of space and\ntime. When di\ufb00use light from a far\naway galaxy passes close to a large\nobject,thiscurvedspacetimecausesits\npath to be bent, or lensed, and focused\nonto a narrow path. Measurements of\nthe extent of this lensing can be used\nto estimate the object\u2019s mass, as the\nheavier it is, the greater the e\ufb00ect it\nwill have on nearby spacetime.\nUsing data from the Large Binocular\nTelescope in Arizona, and the Hubble\nspace telescope, the astronomers at\nthe Max Planck Institute have broken\na 30 year record by discovering a\ngravitational lens more than a billion\nMost distant gravitational lens yet discovered\nlight years further away than the\nmost distant one previously known.\nThrough careful measurements, they\nhave estimated its mass at 8 x 1010\ntimes the mass of our sun. This is an\nimportant \ufb01nding, as it enables them\nto verify the more usual techniques\nused to weigh very distant galaxies,\nwhich are based on extrapolations\nfrom nearer examples that we know\nmore about.\nThe images from Hubble showed\nETHAN GOOD\nJames Bezer\nScience Writer\nAmundsen-Scott south pole station, now under \u201ccaretaker status\u201d\nlight from an even more distant\ngalaxy forming a full circle, called an\nEinstein ring, around the nearer one\nthat caused the lensing. This is a sign\nof very precise alignment between the\ntwo galaxies and the earth, which is\nvery unusual. The more distant dwarf\ngalaxy, just a few tens of millions of\nyears old, and around 108 times the\nmass of the sun, is a type that\u2019s thought\nto be very rare. Such a perfect example\nof gravitational lensing involving one\nshould, therefore, be extremely rare.\nYet this is the second discovery in\nrecent years. It is as yet unknown\nas to whether this is due to chance,\nor if these galaxies are actually more\ncommon than our current theories\nwould suggest. According to Arjen\nvan de Wel, head of the group, these\nsurprising observations \u201chave the\npotential to start a new chapter in our\ndescription of galaxy evolution in the\nearly universe.\u201d\nNASA / ESA / A.

Seizing\nwhat is believed to be $3.6 million\ndollars in bitcoins, a small fraction\nof their $80 million pro\ufb01ts, during\nthe online raid, the FBI also managed\nto claim hold of the sites \u2018digital\nwallets\u2019, used to store some of the\nmarketplace\u2019s virtual assets.\nClaiming its name from the ancient\ntrade route connecting Europe,\nChina, and India through the\nlucrative silk merchandise bought\nand sold along its length, this site\nmainly involves the trade of a wide\nvariety of narcotics. Other goods\nand services were also o\ufb00ered, such\nas forgeries and the more extreme -assassination services.\nThe alleged founder and owner of\nthe site, Ross William Ulbricht, 29,\nwas arrested by the FBI, convicted\nof narcotics tra\ufb03cking, computer\nhacking and money laundering\nconspiracies.\nUlbricht, who goes by his online\nalias of \u2018Dread Pirate Roberts\u2019, or\nDPR, a \ufb01ctional character from The\nPrincess Bride novel, will soon be\nheading to New York to face these\nallegations.\nAmongst his charges, it was\nalso stated that the website was\ngenerating 9.5 million bitcoins in\nsales, an equivalence of $1.2 billion.\nDespite this being one of the feds\nlargest online bitcoin con\ufb01scations,\nthey were still unable to seize\nUlbricht\u2019s own personal stash of $80\nmillion.\nA bitcoin, being a very volatile\ncurrency, requires a personal\npassword for transactions of it to be\nmade; unless Ulbricht hands over his\npassword to the feds, he may still be\nable to keep a hold of his wealth even\nif found guilty of all the charges.\nUlbricht, who studied Chemical\nEngineering and is an advocate of\nlibertarian economics, was what\nseemed to be a smart, charismatic\nperson with a bright future ahead\nof him, as his mother, Lyn Lacava\ndescribes. \u201cHe is a really stellar, good\nperson and very idealistic. I know he\nnever meant to hurt anyone\u201d.\nHowever, his online activities\nseemed to portray a darker side to\nhim. If you can go so far as to excuse\nUlbricht for setting up this \u2018grand\nbazaar\u2019 in the name of free trade\nand personal freedoms, it is more\ndi\ufb03cult to look past his calling upon\nthe assassination of a Silk Road user\nwith whom he had a dispute with.\nThe user, known as \u2018FriendlyChemist\u2019,\nwas accused by the founder of\nblackmailing to reveal the indentities\nof thousands of other Silk Road users\nunless he was paid. This threat being\ninexcusable to \u2018Dread Pirate Roberts\u2019\nlead him to call upon the death of his\nonline counterpart,\nIn a later post to justify his hit\nrequest, Ulbricht stated, \u201cHe is\nthreatening to expose the identities\nof thousands of my clients. This\nkind of behaviour is unforgivable\nto me. Especially here on Silk Road,\nanonymity is sacrosanct\u201d.\nIt\u2019s not just \u2018Dread Pirate Roberts\u2019\nwho seemed to have a \u2018righteous\u2019 fury\nover any transgressors of the sanctity\nof Silk Road. Other regular users,\nwho used this utility on a regular\nbasis, but found that they could no\nlonger have drugs and other illegal\ngoods delivered to their door like\ngroceries are calling for revenge.\nAfter the shutdown of this \u2018sacred\u2019\nservice, their chief target is special\nagent Chris Tarbell \u2013 one of the\nkey FBI o\ufb03cials responsible for the\ntracking down and closure of Silk\nRoad.\nOn rendezvous forums across\nthe web, Silk Road users have been\nposting the home address of Tarbell\nwith the hope of swift vengeance. As\none user, \u2018MendoHashMan,\u2019 wrote, \u201cI\nthink there should be a public list of\nall agents involved, names, addresses,\npictures, family info, just make it\nknown that we know.\u2019\nClearly with the shutting down\nof Silk Road widespread anger has\nspread across its community. This is\nnot the \ufb01rst time the US government\nhas shut down illegal websites and\narrested its founders, only to \ufb01nd the\nsame or similar sites springing up\nagain, but under di\ufb00erent domains.\nWhether there is any point or not\nin trying to contain the internet, it\nis evident that people cherish their\nsense of online community whether\nit be through innocent online games\nsuch as World of Warcraft, or more\nsinister drug dealing services such as\nSilk Road, and hence would not allow\ntheir fraternities to simply crumble\neven if they may have to face the full\nforce of their governments. As one of\nSilk Road\u2019s moderators, Cirrus, put\nit, \u2018We must stand on the shoulders\nof this tragedy that has befallen us\nand raise high what still remains - our\nsense of community, freedom and\njustice.

Based on the shockingly true story of Solomon Northup\n(Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man\nliving in Saratoga, New York who was\nabducted and sold into slavery where\nhe was subjected to unthinkable abuse\nand cruelty for 12 long years, Steve\nMcQueen\u2019s (Hunger, Shame) third\ndirectorial effort, making its round\nin the festival circuits this year (Tel-luride, Toronto, London) before it\ngoes on general release, will leave\nyou speechless and intensely moved.\nThis is a film of genuine, unflinching\nemotions, where no character goes to\nwaste, where the pitch-perfect performances from its tremendous cast\ndo wonders to capture the essence of\ntheir roles, and where a director with\na sharp pair of eyes creates a harrowing atmosphere in one of the most uncomfortable eras and topics of American history.\nEvery single minute of the film\u2019s\nrunning time is a painful one, not that\nyou\u2019d expect it to be any other way. As\nhe is torn away from his family, beaten\nseverely, and forced to work exhaustively under the burning sun, Solomon\u2019s many encounters are what drive\nthe narrative forward.\nCondescending, money-grabbing\nTheophilus Freeman (brilliantly conniving Paul Giamatti who shines even\nin a role that lasts five minutes or so)\nwipes Northup\u2019s history clean to potential buyers. Northup is now to be\ncalled Platt, and is not to mention\nhis previous status as a free man to\nanyone. Any sign of disobedience will\nlead to beating and whipping. His first\nslave owner is William Ford (Benedict\nCumberbatch), a considerate Baptist\npreacher, a rare character trait among\nthe usual slaves\u2019 masters.\nViolence and torture reach a new\nterrifying height, however, with Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), Platt\u2019s\nnew owner who is the personification\nof evil as he terrorises his group of\nslaves, using the words of his scripture\nto justify his acts of punishment. He\nalso has a twisted crush on one of his\nslave girls, Patsey (Lupita Nyong\u2019o),\nsomething Epps\u2019 jealous wife Mary\n(Sarah Paulson) doesn\u2019t allow to go\nunnoticed, by unleashing her own\npersonal anger towards the innocent\ngirl.\nEjiofor is magnetic in his lead per-formance, as his intense restraint becomes all the more painful to watch\nas Platt\u2019s life continues in such mis-ery. He wants to fight back, of course,\nand yet with his surroundings he is\ncompletely powerless to stop the gut-wrenching injustice. This feeling of\ncomplete helplessness is further emphasised in one particuarly harrowing scene (one of many) that involves\nPlatt hanging from a tree, with his\nfeet barely touching the ground for\nsupport, whist everyone in the background (the black slaves, the white\n\u201cmasters\u201d) don\u2019t dare interefere. There\nis something so quietly passionate\nabout what little Ejiofor says in words\nthat even in silence there is profound\nsadness and fear that translate so well\non screen. His extraordinary portrayal on screen certainly pays off in the\nfilm\u2019s rightfully tear-jerking finish, and\nyou\u2019ll want to cry with him.\nAs for the two main villains of the\nfilm, Fassbender and Paulson are simply superb. Fassbender has a history of\nnot scoring worthy wins with awards,\nbut with this performance he has truly\noutdone himself, certainly his nastiest,\nmost brutal and vicious one yet, and\nan Oscar win is certainly within reach.\nThe Epps couple have nothing but\nhatred and deserve nothing but exactly that from the audience, and this\nlevel of malicious energy is certainly\nnot easy to watch. Paulson, so calm\nyet piercingly malicious at every turn\nwith her words and deeds, is nothing\nshort of hateful. They have a bad habit\nof reducing humans to nothing more\nthan mere property, and their almost\nchild-like claim on what\u2019s theirs is as\nresentful as it is disturbing.\nThe relatively smaller roles filled\nwith big names are worth their short\nbut memorable screen time: both\nBrad Pitt and Alfre Woodard contribute significantly to the finished prod-uct, their roles playing pivotal roles in\nPlatt\u2019s struggle for freedom.\nBut the most gut-wrenching, breakout performance here is given by Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong\u2019o, in her first\ndebut feature film role. She has only a\nhandfdul of scenes of actual dialogue\nbut it\u2019s her raw, uninhibited approach\nto her role that demands not only your\nundivided attention, but also your\nsympathy as she is put through endless abuse from her owners.\nMcQueen\u2019s third film is certainly a\nbig leap in size and scale from his two\nprevious pictures. But this sudden\nchange is something the British director is more than capable of handling.\nHe takes the element of suffering to\na whole new level. That frightening\nsound of every whip crack, the horrendous sight of blood splattering,\nthe disturbing view of the many deep\nscars left behind are only a few examples of what McQueen captures without any obvious censorship, allowing\nthe scene to go on and on for maximum effect.\nKnowing the fate of Solomon\nNorthup won\u2019t diminish the power the\nfilm will have as a whole. Even though\non the surface the final few moments\nmay be a joyous one, there is still that\npainfully distressing feeling lurking\naround somewhere as the credits start\nrolling. And no matter how unsettling\nthe film\u2019s theme may be, this is the\nnumber one must-see film of 2013.\n\n"

    "content": "5\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 25 OCT\nFEATURES\nT\nhe Intergovernmental Panel\nfor Climate Change (IPCC)\nreleased merely one part\nof its six-yearly report last\nmonth, and alarm bells\nhave begun ringing across the world:\napparently, it is 95% certain humans\nhave been the largest contributing\nfactor to global warming since the\n1950\u2019s.\nA general overview of the key facts\nand \ufb01gures is a must for digesting\nwhat this report actually says:\n* Warming of the climate system is\nunequivocal, and since the 1950s,\nmany of the observed changes are\nunprecedented over decades to\nmillennia. The atmosphere and ocean\nhave warmed, the amounts of snow\nand ice have diminished, sea level\nhas risen, and the concentrations of\ngreenhouse gases have increased.\n* Each of the last three decades has\nbeen successively warmer at the\nEarth\u2019s surface than any preceding\nfrom net land use change emissions.\nThe ocean has absorbed about 30%\nof the emitted anthropogenic carbon\ndioxide, causing ocean acidi\ufb01cation.\n* Global surface temperature change\nfor the end of the 21st century is\nlikely to exceed 1.5\u00b0C relative to\n1850 to 1900. Warming will continue\nbeyond 2100. Warming will continue\nto exhibit interannual-to-decadal\nvariability and will not be regionally\nuniform.\nSuch dire forecasts backed by\nmathematical certainty come as a\nrespite for climate change believers\nwho in recent years had been\nchallenged to explain why global\nwarming rates had been gradually\ndeclining in the last decade. Now,\ntheir response is to say that \u201cdue to\ndecade since 1850. In the Northern\nHemisphere, 1983\u20132012 was likely\nthe warmest 30-year period of the last\n1400 years.\n* Ocean warming dominates the\nincrease in energy stored in the\nclimate system, accounting for more\nthan 90% of the energy accumulated\nbetween 1971 and 2010.\n* Over the last two decades, the\nGreenland and Antarctic ice sheets\nhave been losing mass, glaciers have\ncontinued to shrink almost worldwide,\nand Arctic sea ice and Northern\nHemisphere spring snow cover have\ncontinued to decrease in extent.\n* The rate of sea level rise since the\nmid-19th century has been larger than\nthe mean rate during the previous two\nmillennia (high con\ufb01dence). Over the\nperiod 1901\u20132010, global mean sea\nlevel rose by 0.19m [0.17m to 0.21m].\n* The atmospheric concentrations of\ncarbon dioxide (CO2\n), methane, and\nnitrous oxide have increased to levels\nunprecedented in at least the last\n800,000 years. CO2\nconcentrations\nhave increased by 40% since pre-industrial times, primarily from\nfossil fuel emissions and secondarily\nnatural variability, trends based on\nshort term records are very sensitive\nto the beginning and end dates and\ndo not, in general, re\ufb02ect long term\ntrends.\u201d This, backed up by the above\nfacts, could well be indicative of\na very real warning regarding our\nimpacts on the Earth\u2019s climate.\nSo the science has been made\nclear, but what\u2019s stopping people\nor even governments from taking\ncombative action? One major factor\nis the reluctance to take a personal,\nconscious stake in moulding the\nclimate at the cost of short- and\nlong-term personal comforts, or\neven at the cost of a political party\nlosing popularity. Another common\nsentiment is that any human e\ufb00orts\nto reverse the anthropogenic impacts\nwould be futile, so there\u2019s no point\nexpending resources to even try to\ndo so.\nAll these hard statistics indicate\nthat the tide is turning against\nclimate change skeptics in terms of\nfactual evidence. But has it made\na di\ufb00erence in terms of motivating\nthem? As inquired by The American\nThinker, why should we try to prevent\nthe climate from changing, if it was\neven caused by us to begin with?\nChange is the only constant in nature\nand it could be less complicated and\nmore appealing to corporate interests\n(and therefore, to politicians and\nskeptics alike) to invest in adapting\nour lifestyles to warmer temperatures\nrather than trying to actually bring\nthe temperature down.\nWhat\u2019s certain is thatall of us impact\nthe climate to some extent, whether\nnegligible or not. If you believe we are\nthe dominant cause, how can you go\nabout convincing others of this and\nwhat do you think can be feasibly\ndone to address this? If you believe\nour role is arbitrary, how would you\nchallenge the IPCC report and the\nadverse impacts on human life that\nare already beginning to manifest\nthemselves (e.g. more severe natural\ndisasters?) To be continued\u2026\nWant to hear more in-depth\ndiscussions of the IPCC report from\ndistinguished personalities such\nas John Vidal, Professor Sir Brian\nHoskins, and Dr Chris Brierly?

Is\nthat even allowed?!\nCast away your narrow\nwestern minds and think again. For\nthat\u2019s what this exhibition will do \u2014\nmake you think again.\nSo \ufb01rst things \ufb01rst \u2013 what is Shunga?\nDeveloped in the early 17th century,\nShunga (meaning \u201cspring pictures\u201d)\nis Japanese erotic art, produced by\nwell-known artists for the enjoyment\nof Japanese people of all classes. From\ngilded scrolls to printed booklets,\nShunga was available to all, and\nenjoyed by middle class newlyweds\nas much as high \ufb02ying Samurais. They\ndepict erotic scenes of various types,\nand with di\ufb00ering levels of explicitness\nand conventionality.\nAt the British Museum, great\nemphasis is put on the fact that these\nare works of art, and not just base\npornography, and this is certainly true.\nIn all the artworks shown, everyone\nseems to be having fun \u2013 couples,\nthreesomes and groups \u2013 and there is\nno sense of objecti\ufb01cation.\nBut the main di\ufb00erence between\nwestern pornography and these\ncolourful, kimono clad sex-scenes\nis surely in the viewer. Shunga was\nconsidered an entirely acceptable part\nof life, and was in no way shameful\nor frowned upon until the mid-18th century, when the combination\nof a new military government and\nan increased western presence in\nJapan caused legislation to be passed\nagainst it. Thus, wandering around\na gallery full of boobs, erections and\nsome rather fanciful positions (17th\ncentury Japanese people were clearly\nmore \ufb02exible than the average 21st\ncentury European) there is a feeling of\nenjoyment, amusement, interest, but\nno embarrassment or awkwardness\n\u2013 these pictures feel natural and\nacceptable.\nAs you wander round the exhibition,\namongst such artworks as How the\nJewelled Rod Goes In and Out, make\nsure you read the translations of the\nShunga captions \u2013 most pictures have\nthe lover\u2019s conversations written in the\nmargins. These complete the Shunga,\nand are often funny dialogues, saucy\npoems or just the sort of things you\nISRAEL\nGOLDMAN\nCOLLECTION\nFred Fyles witnesses the destruction\nWhat: Art Under Attack: Histories\nof British Iconoclasm\nWhere: Tate Britain, SW1\nWhen: Until 5th January 2014\nPrice: \u00a313.10, \u00a311.30 concessions,\nmembers free\nI\nn an art world full of controversy,\nit can be di\ufb03cult to \ufb01nd a work\nthat truly hits you on a gut level.\nHirst\u2019s \ufb02ies and rotting meat?\nOld hat. The Chapman Brothers\u2019\nhorrors of war? Been there, done that.\nBut at the Tate Britain\u2019s latest\nexhibition, Art Under Attack: Histories\nof British Iconoclasm, there is a work\nthat still manages to pack a punch: a\nlife-sized statue of Jesus from the 16th\nCentury, discovered in Mercers\u2019 Hall\nin 1954.\nThe work is sublime, with an\nincredible attention to detail, but what\nmakes it special is what the statue is\nmissing \u2014 protestant reformers have\nhacked o\ufb00 the feet, legs, and right\narm, leaving the face untouched,\nwearing an expression of pain and\nanguish, almost as if in reaction to\nwhat has been done. This forms the\ncentrepiece of a beguiling and tragic\nexhibition which explores the role of\ndestruction in artwork.\nIconoclasm \u2014 from the Greek for\n\u201cimage-breaking\u201d \u2014 refers to the\ndeliberate destruction of a culture\u2019s\nown monuments and artworks, and\nis a word loaded with religious and\npolitical meaning. The \ufb01rst section\nof the exhibition cuts a familiar\npath through the reformation of the\n16th and 17th centuries, as Henry\nVIII broke away from the Catholic\nChurch. In the years that followed, a\nsystematic campaign destroyed the\nmajority of the country\u2019s religious art;\nwhat resulted was one of the biggest\nlosses to ever happen to Western art.\nThere are paintings of The\nAssumption with Mary\u2019s face viciously\nscratched out, fragments of beautiful\nrood screens, and smashed stained\nglass. It is like seeing the casualties of\nwar, and, as if witnessing some kind\nof atrocity, it takes all my strength\nnot to look away. The damage to the\nworks is not half-hearted; some of the\nsculptures, hewn from stone and iron,\nhave had axes and pikes turned on\nthem, in a display of brutal force.\nYet some of the other works show\nhow the public were occasionally\nvehemently opposed to these\npractices. We are told how the doors\nto Canterbury Cathedral had to be\nsealed to prevent the locals stopping\nthe destruction; a painting, beautiful\nin its austere detail, shows the stripped\ndown interior of the cathedral. In the\ncentre are a group of reformers, and\nat \ufb01rst it looks like they have just\n\ufb01nished a meeting, but then your eyes\nare drawn to the edges of the picture,\nand the heart sinks as you see men\nwith pikes systematically smashing\nthe famous stained glass windows.\nIt is works like this that form the\nbest and most arresting part of the\nexhibition. Unfortunately the next\nsection doesn\u2019t quite live up to this,\nneither the works involved nor in\nterms of emotional baggage. The\nsecond section consists of art and\nmonuments destroyed for political\nreasons, and although an interesting\ntopic, the visual experience leaves\nmuch to be desired. The layout of the\nthis section, which juxtaposes images\nof the monuments that were destroyed\nwith pieces of rubble taken from the\nscene, fails to impress, and the section\non the su\ufb00ragettes tones it down even\nmore, showing only photographs of\nthe images they attacked.\nThe attack on The Rokeby Venus by\nMary Richardson forms the focal point\nof the room; the painting has formed\nthe archetype of the European female\nnude, while the attack is arguably the\nmost well known of the su\ufb00ragettes\u2019\nvandalism, and the reasons behind\nit are clear \u2014 why are such works,\ndisplaying inanimate representations\nof women, f\u00eated by society, while real\nwomen, most notably the legendary\nEmmeline Pankhurst, were abused by\nsociety.\nThe focus of the exhibition then\nshifts away from political protest, into\naesthetic actions, and it is here that the\nexhibition really falls down. Showing\nworks by Allen Jones, Reg Butler, and\nCarl Andre that were at one point\nvandalised but are now repaired\nseems somewhat pointless, and the\npolitical reasons behind these attacks\nseem at times \ufb02imsy and irrational.\nThe \ufb01nal two rooms look at the role\ndestruction has in the artistic world,\nboth through direct destruction and\nthe subversion and transformation\nof existing artworks. The work by\nGustav Metzger, including a video\nof his now-legendary Acid Action\nPainting performed at the Southbank,\nin which he sprays acid onto a sheet\nof nylon, is a highlight, a paradigm\nof auto-destructive art. Pieces by\nThe Chapman Brothers, in which\nthey paint over historical portraits,\nquestion what ownership means in\nart, but lack the visceral punch of\nworks such as Ai Weiwei\u2019s destruction\nof ancient Chinese pottery. Mark\nWallinger removes the meanings in\n\ufb01lms by cutting away most of the\nimage, while Michael Wilkinson\nunspools magnetic tape in order to\nform abstract sculptures, showing how\nart can be appropriated to create new\nworks. John Stezaker\u2019s work \u2014 always\na welcome presence at any gallery \u2014\nmakes a brief appearance with pieces\nfrom his Mask series, in which photos\nare spliced together with a cutting\ndegree of wit. But overall the section\nfeels arbitrary, as though the pieces\nhave been chosen at random.\nThe act of iconoclasm is a\ncontroversial, reactionary one, which\nis both exciting and horri\ufb01c. It would\nbe fantastic if the exhibition re\ufb02ected\nthis. But while it starts out well, it soon\nbegins to lose its way, meandering\nbetween grandiose political\nstatements and meaningless acts of\nvandalism, before ending up with a\nconfused collection of new artworks.\nWith its numerous photographs and\nblocks of text, this feels more like a\nhistory lesson than something to get\nthe heart racing; it is an interesting\nlesson, but a lesson nonetheless.\nChair (1969) by Allen Jones was attacked with paint stripper in 1986 by feminist\ncampaigners. It is currently on display in the exhibition, in its restored form.\nwished you hadn\u2019t overheard through\nyour housemate\u2019s door. Before you\nleave, make absolutely certain you\nhave had a good look at The Dream of\na Fisherman\u2019s Wife \u2013 those octopodes\nhave got their tentacles everywhere.\nAll in all highly worth a trip \u2013\nthough be warned. If, like this author,\nyou look young enough to get ID-ed\nwhen buying scissors in Tesco, be\naware that it may be embarrassing\nbeing asked if you\u2019re old enough to\nview the exhibition unaccompanied.\nTATE \u00a9 ALLEN JONES\n\n"

    "content": "29\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 25 OCT\nGAMES\ngames? Its Pok\u00e9mon, just X 2!\nThe game does have its own quirky\nmoments. There are derpy characters\nthat think out loud, and literally give\naway their passwords after you defeat\nthem. One of your friends can mention\nthat she has never seen \ufb01reworks\nalone with a boy before, and then\nsomeone comes up to give the both of\nyou the Protect TM right after. Some\nof the characters want to thank you by\nbattling you. Game Freak also seems\nto have a weird interpretation of the\nFrench culture \u2014 there seems to be an\noverabundance of caf\u00e9s. There is no\nend of positive reinforcement in the\ngame. You are constantly rewarded\nfor talking to NPCs by getting items.\nYou are constantly told that you are on\nyour way to greatness.\nThis is the part of the games that I\nam most passionate about, especially\nwhen trying to explain to people\nwhy I still play Pok\u00e9mon games. For\nthe avoidance of doubt, I would like\nto iterate that Pok\u00e9mon games are\nnot just for kids \u2014 they have great\ngameplay mechanics which make\ncompetitive battling really fun. If you\nare not familiar with the mechanics,\nthis section might not make much\nsense to you.\nPok\u00e9mon X and Y introduce many\nwelcome changes to the gameplay\nmechanics, the e\ufb00ects of which\nremain to be seen once the community\ngets more familiar with the games and\nstarts competing.\nFor the \ufb01rst time in the 14 years\nsince the original release of Pok\u00e9mon\nGold and Silver, a new type has been\nintroduced: Fairy. Fairy is introduced\nin order to bring balance to the game\nby being super-e\ufb00ective against and\nimmune to the Dragon type. It is\nalso weak to Poison type, which has\nbeen really underused so far. This is\nprobably the most exciting change in\nthis generation, and I am eager to see\nhow this changes competitive battling.\nMega-evolution is the next biggest\nchange in mechanics. Some Pok\u00e9mon\nare now able to temporarily mega-evolve into an ever stronger stage\nduring a battle. They might get new\nabilities, or even change their types.\nThis comes at the cost of having\nto hold a certain item in order to\nmega-evolve. At the time of writing,\nnot all of the mega-evolutions have\nbeen discovered. It also remains to\nbe seen how this would change the\ncompetitive landscape.\nGame Freak has also tried to reduce\nthe level of grind in the game, one of\nthe greatest complaints. With the new\nExp Share item that grants 50% of the\nexperience to all the Pok\u00e9mon who\ndid not take part in battles, it is now\nextremely easy to level up, although\nthis could make the game feel too\neasy. In fact, by the eighth gym, my\nteam was 15 levels ahead of the gym\nleader. Capturing wild Pok\u00e9mons\nnow also gives experience. Training\nof e\ufb00ort values (EV) has also been\nmade easier. There is a new \u201cSuper\nTraining\u201d mini-game that allows you\nto boost the desired EV. Breeding has\nalso seen its fair share of changes by\nmaking it easier to pass on abilities\n(including hidden ones), moves, and\neven Individual Values from parents.\nAll of these changes will serve to make\ncompetitive battling more accessible\nto newcomers, and will hopefully\nencourage more players to take part.\nIn addition to the \u201cSuper Training\u201d\nmini-game, there is also the Pok\u00e9monAmie mini game that allows you to\nliterally play with your Pok\u00e9mon by\nstroking them and feeding them. This\nraises their \u201ca\ufb00ection\u201d level which can\nlead to boosted experience games, and\nincreased accuracy, critical hit ratio,\nand evasion rates during battles.\nPok\u00e9mon X and Y introduces a\nknown total of 69 new Pok\u00e9mon,\nbringing the entire tally to a whopping\n718. While the number of new\nPok\u00e9mon may pale in comparison with\nthe previous generation, it should not\ndetract from the gameplay experience.\nThe variety of wild Pok\u00e9mon you can\nencounter is simply astounding. By the\nsecond badge, I had already captured\nat least 60 unique species, and I was\nconstantly running out of money to\nbuy more Pok\u00e9balls with. Who knows,\nit might be possible to catch\u2019em all!\nThere are also some additional new\nminor features. For example, it is now\npossible to ride some Pok\u00e9mon to\ntraverse harsh terrains. You could also\nhave a \u201csky battle\u201d with certain \u201csky\ntrainers\u201d that only Pok\u00e9mon who have\nsome semblance of \ufb02ight abilities can\nparticipate in. You can also encounter\nup to \ufb01ve Pok\u00e9mon at once in Horde\nEncounters. Personally, I \ufb01nd these\nencounters to be extremely annoying,\nalthough they come with the perk\nthat the hordes have a high chance of\nhaving their hidden abilities.\nThe Pok\u00e9mon series of games has\nalways been about connectivity.\nStarting in Pok\u00e9mon Diamond\nand Pearl, Nintendo has gradually\nembraced the internet to allow for\nremote connectivity. Pok\u00e9mon X and\nY brings about the fruition of all the\nwork in the interleaving games in the\nform of the \u201cPlayer Search System\u201d\n(PSS).\nThe PSS makes it really easy to\ninteract with other players on the\ninternet. When connected to the\ninternet, the PSS will constantly\nshow you \u201cpasserbys\u201d, essentially\nother players who are connected to\nthe PSS, although they are not really\npassing by when they are in places like\nTokyo! In this way, random strangers\ncan challenge you to a battle, or even\nperform a trade. The same goes for\nfriends whom you\u2019ve added to your\nfriend list. The only complaint about\nthis system is the lack of text chat. You\ncould only do voice chat, or nothing.\nWonder Trade is one of the nicest\nfeature of the PSS. Essentially, it\u2019s\na gambling game where you trade\nsomething in return for something\nrandom decided by the system.\nAlthough rife with trashy Pok\u00e9mon,\nonline communities have taken to\n\u201ccleansing\u201d the wonder trade system\nby putting in really rare Pok\u00e9mon,\nincluding shiny Pok\u00e9mon, Pok\u00e9mon\nthat are highly sought for, and even\nPok\u00e9mon infected with the elusive\nPok\u00e9rus.\nFinally, there is a \u201cFriend Safari\u201d\nwhich allows you to capture really\nrare Pok\u00e9mons that cannot be\nencountered normally with the\nhidden abilities. The type of Pok\u00e9mon\npresent is calculated from the friends\nyou\u2019ve added.\nFor people of our generation, it is\nlikely that we grew up with Pok\u00e9mon\nin one way or another. You could\nhave played Pok\u00e9mon when you were\nyoung, and then stopped. Or, you\ncould have been playing Pok\u00e9mon\nwhile growing up. Game Freak intends\nto capitalise on that aspect of nostalgia\none way or another, and this game has\nplenty of nostalgic elements.\nPok\u00e9mon Black and White tried to\ninvoke nostalgia by making everything\nnew, so that you could relive the\nmoments when you picked up the\n\ufb01rst Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue games\nfor the \ufb01rst time. The locations in that\ngame were entirely new, and none of\nthe familiar Pok\u00e9mon appeared until\nyou\u2019ve beaten the game.\nPok\u00e9mon X and Y intends to do so\nin the opposite manner by giving you\neverything that was familiar. Pok\u00e9mon\nintroduced in the older generations\nare a constant \ufb01xture in the game,\nand are absolutely abundant. You\ncould literally catch a Pikachu an hour\ninto the game. The \ufb01rst forest you\nencounter has the exact same layout\nas the Viridian Forest in the original\nPok\u00e9mon Red and Blue games.\nIt works. There have been numerous\nreports of people on the internet\ngetting back into the game after not\nhaving played Pok\u00e9mon for years in\nthe interleaving period, so much so\nthat Nintendo announced 4 million\ncopies of the games being sold over\nthe release weekend. Pok\u00e9mon is\nhuge, and I really hope this helps to\nboost the \ufb02edgling 3DS ecosystem.\nPok\u00e9mon Black and White and\ntheir sequels were one of my favourite\ngames from the series. They broke\nnew grounds in terms of mechanics\nchanges, and really brought me into\nlike the games again. Pok\u00e9mon X and\nY seems to want to do the same for\nan even wider audience, newcomers,\nveterans and even people who have\nstopped playing the games. It is an\nextremely well-re\ufb01ned experience,\naside from some minor complaints..\nIt feels fresh, and is a very modern\nPok\u00e9mon game, complete with the\nmultiplayer connectivity.\nIf you have ever been remotely\ninterested in Pok\u00e9mon before, you\nshould give it a try. Maybe you\u2019ll like\nit and \ufb01nd yourself reminiscing about\nyour younger self playing your \ufb01rst\nPok\u00e9mon game.\nGameplay\nMechanics\nMultiplayer\nConnectivity\nNostalgia\nFinal Words\nNINTENDO\nYONG WEN CHUA/NINTENDO\nYO, CHICKS BE CHECKING OUT MY YOLOSWAG!!!\n\n"

Playing in the\nleague against varsity rivals, Imperial\nMedics, IC were looking to give them\na repeat performance of last year\u2019s\nvictory at The Stoop. The atmosphere\nin the changing room was charged, to\nsay the least, with a near emotional\nwreck of a captain, Mike O\u2019Connell,\ntearfully explaining to the team that\n\u201cwe do not lose to Medics\u201d. Bearing\nthat in mind, as well as a few bruises\nfrom Jack Flanagan\u2019s pre-match head-butts, the team stepped out onto the\npitch to a roar from the crowd of\nnearly a dozen spectators. IC kicked to\nstart, and the game was underway. The\naggression from the o\ufb00set was much\nimproved on last week, and after a\nfew big hits from both the forwards\nand the back line it quickly became\nclear that the Medics didn\u2019t want to\nknow. The scoring opened mid-way\nthrough the \ufb01rst half with a gazelle-like Freddie White dancing through\nthe opposition on a counter attack\nfrom the halfway line. Placing it under\nthe posts, it was an easy conversion.\nIt was 7-0 to the College. Falling back\non the team\u2019s strengths, IC crossed the\nwhite line again soon after o\ufb00 the back\nof a driving maul with Tom Hedley\ngetting the score. Unfortunately, the\nconversion attempt bounced back o\ufb00\nthe uprights leaving the scoreboard\nat 12-0. A Medic attack brought them\nclose to the IC line, but a dogged\nscramble defence and solid tackling\nkept a clean sheet. Pushing back into\nthe middle of the pitch the crowd went\nwild as our prop fresher, Tom, ripped\nthe ball from a maul to burst up the\npitch on a legendary debut break.\nFollowing this, IC were soon in a\nthreatening attack position, once more\nusing the driving maul from a lineout\nto score a well-executed set piece try.\nUnfortunately, the referee didn\u2019t seem\nto agree and the try was questionably\ndisallowed. Moving into the second\nhalf the game continued at the same\npace. Solid tackling from the entire\nteam stunted the Medic attack and\ndespite conceding a penalty within 5\nmetres of the line, our defensive line\nsoon pushed them back to 15 metres\nout and solid work at the breakdown\nresulted in a key turnover. Some\nconfusion as to what game we were\nplaying resulted in our back line\nbooting the ball some 50 metres up\nthe pitch with great interlinking play\nbetween the wing and centre forward.\nHowever, the ball didn\u2019t quite go to\nhand and the opportunity was wasted\nwith an unlucky knock on 5 metres\nfrom their line. From the back of a\nscrum on the Medic\u2019s 10 metre line\na well executed back line move left\n1st XV debutant Jon Mann in plenty\nof space to burn down the left wing\nand score a well deserved try amidst\nscreams of \u2018F**king yes!\u2019 from our vocal\ncaptain. A missed conversion left the\nscore at 17-0. Further pressure in the\nMedic\u2019s half led to yet another driving\nmaul mildly encouraged from the side\nline by IC\u2019s reserved head coach. A\nwell-organised pack controlled by\nTom Hedley at the back allowed a long\ndrive up the touchline and a second\nscore by Hedley in the \ufb01nal minutes of\nthe game. With less than 90 seconds\nto go, James Cox calmly took his\ntime in slotting a di\ufb03cult conversion\nthrough the middle of the posts from\nnear the sideline. The \ufb01nal whistle\nblew with a satisfying \ufb01nal score\nof 24-0 to Imperial College.

Thus some might argue\nthat there is no rivalry.\nThe pitch was slippery (#rain #3G\n#FORTRESSH), limiting Imperial\u2019s\nability to play their patented tiki-taka brand of football as the ball \ufb02ew\naround the pitch like Drosophilae on\ncocaine. To their credit, the Medics\nbattled hard, \ufb02ying into challenges\nwith courage and desire. Conversely,\nthe line of the Hippocratic Oath\n\u2018I will prescribe regimens for the\ngood of my patients according to my\nability and my judgment and never\ndo harm to anyone\u2019 was broken\ncountless times by dangerous late\nchallenges and unsolicited o\ufb00ers to\nprovide prescription drugs at \u2018great\nprices.\u2019 Imperial were slow to start,\nbut con\ufb01dence exuded from the back,\nwith new keeper Michael barking\norders with the dulcet tones only a\nNorwegian can muster. Though called\nupon rarely, he made some big saves\nand had a fantastic debut for the\nclub. Steadily Imperial 1s began to\nlook sharper. Finally the deadlock was\nbroken. A cross from the right found\nMurphy inside the corner of the box,\nwho using his spidey-sense noticed\nthe keeper rushing out towards him,\nand duly controlled the ball and \ufb02icked\nan aerial square ball to Robinson who\nheaded it over a defender and in from\njust inside the box to score a goal\nsome are calling a frontrunner for\ngoal of the season. It was downhill\nfor the Medics after that, as goals\nfell like dominoes. A free kick some\n35 yards out was speculatively lofted\ntowards the far post, and the Medic\u2019s\nkeeper kindly decided to fumble the\nball into his own net. It was 2-0 to the\nImperial 1s. Next an overlapping run\nby Nielsen culminated in a marvellous\ncross to which Robinson elevated at\nleast 5 metres (give or take) to reach\nand headed the ball into the net. The\n4th goal was spectacular. Full-back\nNugent, taking time out of his busy\nschedule of telling crude/sex related\njokes, made a dazzling run, and\ncurled the ball from left of the goal\ninto the right panel. It was a thing of\npure beauty. Finally, to add insult to\ninjury, Murphy threaded a delightful\n(I\u2019m running out of adjectives) ball\nbetween 2 defenders and the keeper\nto the back post to \ufb01nd an unmarked\nRobinson, who SMASHED (his words\nnot mine) the ball in to score a late\n5th and complete his hat trick. This\nperformance won him Man of the\nMatch to the delight of many fantasy\nfootball managers. The Medics played\nwell and should be commended for\ntheir resilience and fortitude; indeed,\nthey came close a couple of times\nand should be proud of the way they\nplayed if not the score. However, the\nresult was comprehensive and the\nMedics came away worse for wear,\nprompting the some onlookers to call\nfor a doctor to treat Medic\u2019s players\nfor both trauma and shock, as they\nwere in no state to do so themselves.\nImperial 4th \u2018s Put Six Past Greenwich\nOn the morning of the 16th October\n2013, The Force (a.k.a The 4s) readied\nthemselves for D-Day, landing on the\nshores of the Thames for the opening\nmatch of the season: Greenwich away.\nAfter a 12:00 meet at the \u201cSir Alex\nFerguson\u201d building, we bundled in\nfor the short minibus journey 16\nmiles across London for our \ufb01rst local derby. 2 bustlingly bumpy hours\nlater (at a startling average speed of\n8mph) we arrived. Tra\ufb03c-wearied, we\nstumbled into the changing rooms:\nthe horns and beeps and scorns and\nsqueaks of the grizzly London tra\ufb03c\nstill hazing our minds, still disgruntled\nat the irony of a \ufb01re brigade holding\nus up by marching on strike on such a\nglum, wet day. After scandalously being made to pay for parking (SCAFFS),\nwe frantically scattered onto the pitch\nwithout a warm up, and almost without warning, the referee whistled for\nkick o\ufb00. It\u2019s safe to say at this point,\nthere were no smiles.\nThere was great irony then, as it\nturned out that not only could we have\nrun \u2014 or at least cycled \u2014 to Greenwich as our warm up (instead of doing\nthe long minibus journey which made\nus miss the warm up), but in the end,\nthe actual match itself proved to be a\nbetter warm up than we could have\nhoped for! (All o\ufb00ence to Greenwich\ncompletely intended).\nWith the match in progress, some\nunoiled rusty cobwebs were evident\nas the team found its collective touch.\nThen, the mid\ufb01eld trio of Sch\u00f6n,\nRowett and Iacoponi (read as Busquets, Xavi, and F\u00e1bregas) began to\nsettle and dictate as simple passing\nopened up tunnels of space for the\ne\ufb00ective wingers Bruno Howard and\nSmiles Chrisanta to \ufb02y into, generating hefty shots on target and making\nthe Greenwich defence look appropriately green in their defending.\nSome tension built as the crucial\nbreakthrough hadn\u2019t yet come, whilst\na slick wet surface caused some near-blunders as our defence was caught\ncold. Crucially, newly-recruited keeper Sam O\u2019Neil (with our \ufb01rst choice\nSanjiv seized by the 3s\u2026) stepped up\nJulian Iacoponi describes the action as Imperial stroll to victory\nwith some key sweeper-keeper plays,\ngiving us the chance to \ufb01nally capital-ise on our dominance at the other end,\nwith Smiles converting a swish team\nmove with a swish \ufb01nish to match.\nA second quickly followed, coming\nagain from Smiles: the best \ufb01nd in the\nAsian transfer market this summer.\nUnfortunately the Greenwich keeper,\nwho had up to this stage proved their\nmost sturdy player swiping away some\nsubstantial shots, was completely at\nfault managing to fumble a slow chip-shot-cum-pass back into his own net.\nTwo goals up and the tone of the\nmatch set \ufb01rm, the Greenwich fan\nboys started to chirp up \u2013 one even\ntried to bribe the Ref with a pint! But\nour footballing prowess quietened\ntheir rowdy hype. Half time was blown\n\u2014 at a very abrupt time of 30 minutes\n\u2014 with the game perfectly poised.\nWould the mighty Force push on for a\nconvincing victory? Or was it going to\nprove to be a game of 2 thirds?\nThough the match was fairly\nmatched in the \ufb01rst period, Greenwich proved no match for our match-box-loving Imperial 4s in the second.\nSwapping on Naveen Ghulam for\nthe successful Smiles, some stellar\nwing play led to several corners and\nheaded chances for that crucial 3-goal\ncushion/pillow/beanbag/sofa. Henry\nRowett did the honour of securing\nsaid padding with an edge-of-the-box\ndrive into the side netting, followed\nshortly after by a cutting counterattack move seeing Sam \u2018Dzeko\u2019 Duf\ufb01eld slide it under the keeper for our\n4th goal of the game.\nThe 5th goal was as comedic as it\nwas tragic: a perfectly weighted chip\nfrom right-back Phil Gantner saw\nDzeko again through on goal, only this\ntime to be horribly chopped down by\nthe opposition centre-half. Penalty\nduty \u2013 supposedly captain Sch\u00f6n\u2019s domain \u2013 was undertaken by the in-form\ngoal-scoring centre-half in search for\nhis brace. A horri\ufb01c attempt at a penalty ensued, followed only by a more\nhorri\ufb01c attempt at a parry from the\nkeeper, followed again by yet poorer\nfollowing in by the Greenwich de-fence, followed by the yet-worse shin-pad \ufb01nish from Dzeko himself which\nsaw the ball dribble into the side netting o\ufb00 another feeble attempted save\nfrom the keeper. This goal put our victory beyond doubt, but in truth, football was the loser here.\nFrom then on, the Force divided and\nconquered the game, with the last of\nthe goals coming from Marcello Valerio slotting away a composed \ufb01nish to\nround o\ufb00 a comfortable win.\nNoticeable e\ufb00ort was shown from\nSch\u00f6n and Rowett in mid\ufb01eld: the\nlatter of who, despite the 5 goal surplus at the time, devoted a devastating\ncrunch of a tackle to the opposition\nplayer, so eager was he not to lose any\n50:50 challenges that day. Ankles are\na small price to pay for unwavering\ncommitment.\nOther mentions go out to Inigo \u2018Inya-go-son\u2019 Torres and Phil Gantner\nfor providing solidity and creativity at\nwingback, whilst Sander Van der Bie\nand Chris Rochester anchored us well\nat both ends of the pitch. Late in the\ngame Guy Frankel came on, reignit-ing our attack and e\ufb00ectively creating\nchances for our forwards.\nAs tackles were getting more and\nmore reckless from the Greenwich\nSCAFFS, the \ufb01nal whistle was blown,\nonly for us to \ufb01nd that at least 2 of\nour balls had been stolen, the other\none having to be retrieved from the\nSCAFFS possession at the end! We\neven had to share a changing room\u2026\nA post-match MacDonald\u2019s ensured\nmaximum team bonding over a victory that will serve as a con\ufb01dence boost\nand set in motion a winning mentality\nin this burgeoning and talented squad\nof players.

    "content": "36 FRIDAY 25 OCT\nCAREERS Editors: VACANT\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nexperience, as well as a short research\nproject across the summer months\nusually submitted in September.\nThese yearlong courses can provide\nan opportunity to deepen and focus\nyour subject knowledge in an area of\ninterest from your current degree or\nto change direction by studying a new\nsubject of interest, possibly vocational\nor career-related. Entry onto a Masters\nis sometimes possible with a 2:2 class\nof degree depending on where you\napply but a 2:1 is commonly required\nso you will need to research the entry\nrequirements for each course.\nResearch courses include MRes\n(usually one year) or PhD (three to\nfour years). These courses are research\nbased and so as part of your application\nprocess you may be asked to include a\nresearch proposal outlining you area\nof interest and relating this to the\nresearch specialisms in the department\nyou are applying to. There are some\naspects you need to consider carefully\nbefore embarking on a research\ndegree. Unlike your undergraduate\ncourse your progress through a\nresearch degree is much more self-driven. Before choosing for this option\nyou need to think through your level\nof motivation, your persistence and\nresilience. To be successful you really\nneed to enjoy your subject area, you\nwill be immersed in this for the next\nthree to four years. You should also\nhave the strength to push yourself\nand the determination to overcome\nsetbacks. You will have a supervisor\nto support you but without strong\nmotivation you will \ufb01nd the process\nof a PhD di\ufb03cult. In most cases you\nshould expect to gain a 1st or a 2:1 in\nE\nvery year, approximately\n30% of Imperial College\nundergraduates go on to\nfurther study, so we know it\u2019s\na popular option. But what\ndo you need to know and how do you\nmake the best choice of course and\ninstitution?\nLet\u2019s look at the basics. The \ufb01rst\nquestion you need to ask yourself is\nwhat is your long term goal, and how\nwill further study help you achieve\nthis. In all cases further study will\ntake time and in many cases it will also\ntake money so you need to be clear up\nfront on what you expect to gain. It\ncould be that the career area you hope\nto go into has a requirement of some\nkind of further quali\ufb01cation such a\nPGCE for teaching or it might be that\nyou hope to become more specialised\nwhich may open up certain areas of\nwork. Either way it is important to\nweigh up to pros and cons and check\nthat your expectations are realistic.\nMost courses publish information on\noutcomes for their graduates so look\ncarefully to see if people are going on\nto the types of work you hope to follow.\nWhat type of course is best - Masters\nor PhD or perhaps a better question\ninitially is taught course or research\ncourse?\nMSc and MA courses are normally one\ncalendar year in length and take the\nform of a taught period from October\nto May, so very like you undergraduate\nyour \ufb01rst degree and in some instances\nit will be expected that you complete a\nseparate MSc or MRes before applying\nto a PhD. It is not unusual now to \ufb01nd\na \u2018one plus three\u2019 structure where you\napply for both Masters and PhD and\non successful completion of the one\nyear Masters you continue on to a PhD.\nThe application process can be\nconfusing. It takes time to properly\nresearch postgraduate study and\nunlike your undergraduate application\nthere is normally no limit on the\nnumber of Masters or PhD courses\nyou can apply for. You will need to\ncomplete separate applications forms\nPostgraduate Study: Is it for you?\nCareers Service\nImperial College\nfor each institution. There are a few\nexceptions to this and these tend to\nbe in very vocational areas such as\nPGCE for teaching and Graduate\nDiploma courses in Law where you\napply through a clearing system\nsimilar to UCAS. Choosing research\ndegrees requires even more thought\nand it will really help to discuss your\nresearch ideas with your department.\nYour academic contacts will have ideas\nabout how to develop your research\nproposal and information about\nwhich research groups and university\ndepartments specialise in your subject.\nThey may also be able to provide some\nintroductions for you to do some early\nnetworking or engage in some mini\nresearch experiences. If your \ufb01nal year\nundergraduate project is connected to\nthe area you think you might like to\nstudy at PhD then use the opportunity\nto set up some links at Imperial and\nfurther a\ufb01eld through your project.\nIf you are considering applying for\ncourses outside the UK you also need\nto \ufb01nd out about additional tests,\nexams and application deadlines. For\ninstance applicants for postgraduate\nstudy in the USA have to complete an\nappropriate admissions test depending\non the subject of study such as the\nGMAT, GRE General, GRE Subject\nand MCAT. It is also important to\nunderstand not just the application\nprocess but also the structure of\ncourses, for instance in the USA it is\nnot unusual to take 8 to 9 years to gain\na PhD. Details on how to apply for\nstudy in the USA can be found via the\nFulbright website at fulbright.org.uk\nFinding the funding can also take\ntime. Whether you are a UK, EU\nor international student \ufb01nding\nfunding for postgraduate study is a\ncomplex process. When researching\npossible courses you should also be\nasking questions about availability of\nfunding. Are there research council\ngrants available, industry funded\nscholarships, university scholarships?\nHow many participants have to self-fund? In the instance of research\ncouncil funding you need to check out\nthe prerequisites and the time scales,\noften RCUK funded places require\nearlier application deadlines. If you are\nconsidering self-funding you may also\nneed to check if studying part time is\nan option allowing you time to also\nwork to pay the bills. It is important\nto shop around when thinking about\nself-funded further study. Universities\ncharge di\ufb00ering fees particularly at\nMasters level so investigate widely to\nget the best deal. Europe might be\nan option as increasingly European\nuniversities are teaching in English\nand often have surprisingly low tuition\nfees.\nFurther information on applying for\nfurther study and funding can be found\nat www3.imperial.ac.uk/careers/ug/\nconsideringfurtherstudy\nFinally, start your planning early.\nTalk to PhDs and Post Docs in your\ndepartment. Build up a realistic\npicture of what is going to be involved,\nthe excitement as well as the challenges\nand remember that you can arrange\nto meet with one of the Careers\nConsultant team to discuss your\nfurther study ideas and for support\nwith the application process.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON\nWhat\u2019s On at the Careers Service this week?\nMonday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday\nWorkshop\nGroup Mock Interview\n12:30 \u2013 14:00\n(Apply via Jobs Live)\nSeminar\nE\ufb00ective Applications\n16:15 \u2013 17:15\n(Apply via Jobs Live)\nPop-up CV Check\n@ Junior Common Room\n12:45 \u2013 13:45\nJust turn up with a paper copy\nof your CV!

For bread that has gone hard, dampen\nthe outside of the loaf with a bit of water\nand pop it in the oven for 10 mins at around\n180oC. This also works for limp biscuits!\nBut just 5 mins will do.\n2. To keep lettuce fresh, separate the leaves\nand store them in a bowl of water in the\nfridge. Replace the water every few days.\n3. Bought too many sausages for your\nweekend fry up? Use it in a stir fry!\n4. Chop up bananas that are about to go\noff and freeze them - this will make a very\nnice revision treat!\n5. Too much cheese? Grate and freeze it\nso you can put it straight into pasta sauces\nor even lasagnes.\nFeed Yourself, Not Your Bin\nMichael Chung\nFood Editor\nH\now much food do we\nthrow away? Well, a\nquick survey in the EEE\nLevel 5 labs shows that\nas students, we try to\neat everything we buy in our shop.\nUnfortunately students only make up\nabout 4% of the UK population, and\nTesco has revealed earlier this week\nthat it generated almost 30,000 tonnes\nof food waste in the \ufb01rst 6 month of\n2013. Just to put that into perspective,\nthat is just over 1500 new Boris buses\nfull of passengers, each eating 2\nWeetabix biscuits and drinking a litre\nof milk.\nThese \ufb01gures were based on\ninformation collected from the chain\u2019s\nsupermarkets, distribution centres,\nsuppliers and producers. With over\n3000 stores in the UK, Tesco suggested\nthat the two highest categories are\nbakery and fruit and vegetables. In\nparticular, 40% of apples and 68%\nof salad sold in bags was wasted.\nIn response to this, Tesco has\nannounced that it will end multi-buy deals on large bags of salad,\nremoving \u201cdisplay until\u201d dates from\nfresh fruit and vegetables, using\nsmaller delivery cases and rearranging\nthe bakery display to reduce the\namount of bread sold in store.\nThe UK government estimates\nthat 7.2 million tonnes of food and\ndrink were thrown away from homes\nevery year, of which the majority can\nstill be eaten. This comes to a cost\nof \u00a312 billion a year for its e\ufb00ect to\nenvironment and wastes resources.\nA report released by the Institution\nof Mechanical Engineers have found\nup to 30% of the UK\u2019s vegetable crop\nis never harvested purely for cosmetic\nreasons. These are the marketing\npolicies many supermarkets adopt to\nmeetconsumerexpectations:rejecting\nedible fruit and vegetables at the farm\nbecause of its physical characteristics,\nsuch as size and appearance.\nHow about Imperial?\nThere are around 22,000 students\nand sta\ufb00 at Imperial, and collectively\nwe consume a lot of food every day,\nbut do we eat it all? The College has\nbeen separating food waste from Taste\nImperial outlets at South Kensington\nand composting it on site instead of\nsending it to land\ufb01ll. Its data shows\nthat the compost processes nearly 2\ntonnes of food waste a week, which\nincludes unsold leftovers and food left\non the plate. This is quite a staggering\namount, bearing in mind this does not\ninclude food binned in departments.\nHow about in halls? Since 2008,\nthe College has been running the\nStudent Hall Reuse Scheme. The\nscheme aims to donate or recycling\nitems left behind in halls that would\notherwise be sent to land\ufb01ll. In 2012,\nan audit was conducted in the student\nkitchens and it was identi\ufb01ed that\nwith a re\ufb01nement to the system an\nextra \u00a37000 of food left behind and\n\ufb01t for reuse, which could be donated\nto causes such as FoodCycle. That is\nanother reminder of how much money\nwe spent on food that we did not eat.\nWhat can you do?\nRemember the tips we gave you a\nfew issues back on smart supermarket\nshopping. All of them will still be valid\nin reducing food waste - at the end of\nthe day, buy less, waste less and save\nmoney! Writing a list and making\na meal plan will help you make the\nmost of the food you buy and not in\nexcess if you know you will be going\nout with friends for the evening.\nIfyouhaveyetto\ufb01ndafoodshopping\nbuddy, then you can still make the\nmost of the o\ufb00ers without wasting.\nJust make sure it says suitable for\nfreezing and quite often the shelf life\ncan be increased to around 1 month.\nTry to have fresh vegetables and\nfruit that are in season. For example,\nrunner beans and blackberries are in\ntheir prime season now and you can\nintroduce them to your diet and make\nit more interesting! Make some dessert\nwith blackberries for your weekend\ntreat or even have runner beans\ninstead of chips with your burger.\nAnd if you bought too much, you can\nalways freeze it and use it for next time!\nIf you are passionate about the topic\nand want to work with the College\nto decrease food waste and promote\nsustainability, Imperial Hub and the\nEnergy and Sustainbility Department\nof College will be launching this\nyear\u2019s StepChange campaign in a\nfew weeks. You can now register\nto be a Stepchange ambassador on\nimperialhub.org/stepchange.\n\n"

The news of\ntheir upcoming reunion naturally\nsends the media into a frenzy, and anticipation is running high for what is\nto become the theatre-going event of a\nlifetime. The ticket prices are of course\non the pricey side, but no matter, since\nthis is Burton and Taylor, a legendary,\nunmatchable pairing famous both for\ntheir professional careers as well as\ntheir tempestuous personal lives. The\nperformances sell out, and the pressure is on to put on an outstanding\nshow to do their names justice.\nWhat Lifetime couldn\u2019t do, BBC\ncould, and from the get-go you can tell\nthis is going to be a wholly different,\nmuch better film about the Hollywood\ncouple.\nComparing Helena Bonham Carter\nto Lindsay Lohan in an insult in itself,\nand it\u2019s no surprise to see that Carter\nis a much better Elizabeth Taylor than\nLohan can ever dream of being. She\nwalks and talks with charisma and\nconfidence, in her care-free, diva-like\nattitude towards work: she doesn\u2019t\neven read the play before rehearsals\nas she wants to keep things fresh and\noriginal. She doesn\u2019t know her lines,\nher cues, and therefore the rehearsals\ntake absolutely forever to complete.\nThis of course, does not sit well with\nBurton, who has a much more rigid,\nthorough process, a meticulous perfectionist especially when it comes to\nperforming live on stage in front of his\nmany admirers.\nWest, although looking a lot healthier than Burton did during that time\nperiod, is still a brutish acting force\nwho cannot be ignored. He is stern\nand deadly serious throughout, offering a volatile contrast to Carter\u2019s\nrole, and it\u2019s their fiery chemistry that\nmakes this instantly watchable. He\nlooks older and considerably weaker,\nand references to his physical injury as well as his past of alcoholism\nhelp shape him as a damaged but still\nproud man.\nCracks that begin to show during\nthe rehearsals (with Taylor turning\nup drunk, drugged and utterly unprepared for the whole thing), take a turn\nfor the worse when the play actually\ngets going. All that Taylor needs to do\nfor a round of rousing applause from\nthe audience is to simply show up on\nstage. No need to speak the lines, no\nneed to do anything, all she has to do\nis to exist. Burton however, doesn\u2019t\nquite receive that same treatment.\nDoes this spark jealousy? Of sorts. Although Burton\u2019s pride gets in the way\nof making his feelings known, West\ncertainly lets us know that this bothers him.\nGetting into fights and making up\nsoon afterwards is a repetitive cycle they go through again and again,\nwhich provide some fine entertainment as the two of them really go at\neach other, both verbally and in her\ncase, physically too. But behind all the\nharsh words and raised volume, there\nis a sense that the two have never really fallen out of love. They are initially\nreunited purely on a professional level,\nbut as time passes by their mutual attraction becomes difficult to ignore\noutright.\nTaylor is more actively in pursuit\nof romance than Burton, who at this\npoint in life is happily married to Sally.\nBurton lets her know this, which naturally breaks her heart. Here Carter\u2019s\nperformance reaches new heights as\nshe struggles to come to terms with\nhaving to move on with her life. Carter\nis hugely effective, and even for those\nwho disapprove of a woman chasing\na married man, there is an element of\nprofound sadness and regret that is\ncaptured so brilliantly by the English\nactress.\nThe constantly evolving character\nstudy is one that grips and never lets\ngo. Even in its short running time\n(only 82 minutes in length) the film\npacks in so much dramatic force that\nyou sometimes wish perhaps the film\ncould have been longer as Carter and\nWest are endlessly enjoyable to watch.\nBy focusing solely on the relatively\nshort time span of the production\nhistory of the play, the writers have\nroom to delve deep into the complex\ncharacters. Past mistakes and troubles\nare referred to, which give us a more\nsatisfying, rounded picture of the cou-ple; mixing the happy memories of\ntheir magical past that can never be\nrecaptured, as well as looking ahead\nto the emptier, more bleak future also\nrelating this to their declining health,\nending on a very bittersweet note that\nasks the audience to care and empa-thise with a couple who probably will\nhave no realistic long-term prospects.\nIt\u2019s an endearing, memorable little\ntelevision film, one that benefits enormously from the gifted cast playing\ngifted actors.\n\n"

    "content": "4 FRIDAY 25 OCT\nFEATURES Editors: VACANT\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nmperial\u2019s iGEM (international\nGenetically Engineered Machine)\nteam have just \ufb02own back from\nLyon, \ufb01nishing in the top three\nin Europe in the international\nSynthetic Biology competition and\nprogressing to the next round at MIT\nin Boston.\nWe all know Imperial is good at\nEngineering. What you may not know\nis that they can even engineer living\nthings. It may sound crazy but that is\nwhat the people here at the Centre for\nSynthetic Biology and Innovation are\ndoing. Whether sitting all quiescent\nor quaking visibly (the latter being\nthe iGEM team), ideas pop into their\nheads about what they would like\nliving things to do, then they set about\nit. This is exactly what it is all about:\ncan biology be used in those delicate\nand complicated situations where\ntraditional engineering is failing us, in\nwaste management for example?\nThis is the focus of Team Plasticity\u2019s\nproject; turning a mixed waste\nwhich is actually the result of high\ntech recycling facilities into a plastic\nmade inside living cells. Hundreds\nof thousands of tonnes of this waste,\ncalled Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) are\nshipped to Europe to be incinerated\nevery year. Now you may think ah,\nfuel, that is a good thing, right? Well,\nI am sorry to say this but, ugh-urgh,\nincorrect.\nNo 1- it pollutes the environment\nand some studies have linked\nincreased levels of cancer to nearby\nincinerators.\nNo 2- it does not make economic\nsense, with millions of pounds per\nannum spent on disposal by each\nrecycling plant.\nNo.3- it is a downright waste of\nresources.\nOne third of the SRF is made of\nplastics and the rest is paper, wood\nand \ufb01bres. What if you could do\nsomething better with this? What\nif you could turn it into a viable\nalternative to petrochemical plastics\nwhich are causing so much pollution\nand at the same time recycle the\nplastics already in there? Well, this is\nwhat we have been working on.\nWe did this as part of the iGEM\ncompetition which challenges over\n200 teams from around the world\nto design and make a system using\nthe principles of Synthetic Biology\n(Syn Bio). This is the application\nof engineering principles such as\nspeci\ufb01cations, modularisation and\ncomputer modeling to biology. Last\nweekend all the teams from Europe,\n60 in total, met to celebrate their hard\nwork at the regional jamboree. There\nwere some really incredible projects\nand we were lucky enough to place in\nthe top three, earning a place in the\n\ufb01nal at MIT, starting 1st November.\nWe have engineered E.coli to\nproduce the bioplastic poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) inside\nthemselves when using this waste as\ntheir only energy source. PHB is pretty\namazing. Not only can it be used\nas an alternative to petrochemical\nplastics, it can form tissue sca\ufb00olds\nwhich are broken down as the\nbody heals and even be 3D printed.\nImportantly, it can breakdown in the\nenvironment, albeit slowly, into nontoxic compounds. One of the biggest\nissues stopping these plastics playing\na more important role in our lives\nis their cost, which is largely due to\ntheir production from plant biomass.\nOur system aims to lower this price\nand deal with the environmental\nissues associated with incineration\nand petrochemical plastics. After the\nbioplastic has been used it will be fed\ninto our recycling system, to ensure it\nitself is not wasted.\niGEM is not just about the science. It\nis also a hotbed of creativity where the\nteams are encouraged to think about\nhow their projects will impact on the\nworld. This is all towards the goal\nof responsible innovation; ensuring\nthat the technologies are causing\nmore good than harm. Our system is\ndesigned to work at an industrial scale\nbut we have also looked at how our\nworld might look in the future, when\nwaste is seen as a precious resource.\nWe have designed a concept home\nbioreactor linked to a 3D printer,\ndirectly turning your waste into brand\nnew objects. Maybe in the future you\nwon\u2019t have to take the bin bag out, but\ninstead you will be able to print some\nnew shoes!\nYou can \ufb01nd out more about our\nproject here:\n2013.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College\nand more about the best from each\nregion here:\n2013.igem.org/Jamborees\nFrom Trash to Treasure, via\nSynthetic Biology (iGEM)\nIain Bower\nImperial iGEM\nMAPLE \u2013 future waste recycler linked\nto a 3D printer\nIMPERIAL IGEM\nI\nmperial College has had a long\ntradition of hosting prestigious\nchess events in London, starting\nseveral decades ago with the\nKensington Congress \u2013 this fell\nby the wayside somewhat in the early\n2000\u2019s but was revived by Imperial\nCollege alumnus John Sargent in\n2011 with the help of IC Chess Club\u2019s\ncommittee and the English Chess\nFederation.\nNow in its third edition, on a\ncool October afternoon a group of\nenthusiastic normally-players set\naside some hours to turn the Union\nDining Hall into a serious tournament.\nHaving done this twice before things\nwent extremely smoothly for the start\nof the congress, which is just as well\nbecause entries were so successful that\nthe congress was full to capacity well\nin advance of the event taking place.\nBy \ufb01ve o\u2019clock, the room was ready\nand already the \ufb01rst few players were\nturning up in advance, arriving at the\nUnion representing clubs from all\nover England and in a few cases from\nmainland Europe as well!\nThere was something else at stake\nfor the top English (or resident) players\nin the Open section as well, as the\nhighest ranked player at the end of the\nweekend not already quali\ufb01ed would\nbe eligible for a place in the British\nChess Championships in 2014.\nThe \ufb01rst round on Friday night\nproved to be particularly entertaining\ntowards the end of the evening as the\nconcert downstairs in Metric gave\nthe remaining concentrating players\na complimentary massage thanks\nto the bass causing more or less the\nentire building to vibrate! Players were\nforewarned and luckily the e\ufb00ects\nweren\u2019t too detrimental \u2013 although\nwe\u2019re not sure how many \ufb01nished\ntheir games to go dancing downstairs\nafterwards.\nTop seed in the Open section Miguel\nNavarro-Cia, who is a Research Fellow\nat Imperial College in addition to a\nchess FIDE Master, was dramatically\nheld to a draw by Denmark\u2019s Helge\nHjort, assuring that the pecking order\nin the top section would not necessarily\ndictate the weekend\u2019s results. Another\none of the top seeds Patryk Stanisz\nof Poland was defeated by England\u2019s\nStephen Prior to turn any semblance of\nexpected top results on its head.\nSaturday saw a quieter day with\nmixed fortunes for the higher rated\nopponents in the other Major and\nMinor sections \u2013 generally the higher\nrated players had a good day in the\nMajor to \ufb01nish Round 3 roughly in\nthe top quarter of the draw, but the\nMinor saw a lot of exciting, \ufb01ghting\ngames allowing some of the lower rated\nplayers to prove themselves. By the end\nof Saturday evening, England\u2019s David\nGilbert was leading the standings here\nwith two players under 120 ECF grade\nalso in the top \ufb01ve \u2013 Cledwyn Davies of\nWales and Southampton University\u2019s\nRob Hewitt.\nAfter a brief emergency (well,\nrunning out of sugar for co\ufb00ee/tea) on\nSunday morning, the stage was set for\nan interesting \ufb01nish. Top seed NavarroCia would have to \ufb01nd a way to battle\nback from a full point down while\nStephen Prior (rated 300 FIDE points\nhis junior) was leading the tournament\nwith a perfect score but having to fend\no\ufb00 some sti\ufb00 challenges in the \ufb01nal\nrounds. Peru\u2019s Frank Lozano in the\nmean time was half a point clear of the\n\ufb01eld in the Major, and David Gilbert\nfound himself in the same position in\nthe Minor.\nOnly half a point behind going into\nthe \ufb01nal round, the top board Isaac\nCraft and Stephen Prior (both ENG)\ndrew, guaranteeing them a share of \ufb01rst\nplace but with the possibility of being\ncaught for a share of the spoils. We\nthought we might have received an 80-move epic \u2013 turns out 75 of those were\nto be played over a blitz board outside\nthe playing hall.\nDespite his best e\ufb00orts, however,\nMiguel was held to a draw by a resolute\nSteven Jones to \ufb01nish half a point\nbehind the leaders in an incredibly\ntense \ufb01nish. The Minor was next for the\ntop positions to be settled, with David\nGilbert \ufb01nishing on an imperious 4.5\nwith Phil Foley and a strong showing\nby Rob Hewitt half a point behind.\nFinally, the Major section was won by\nMateusz Dydak who won his last game\nto stay half a point clear of the \ufb01eld \u2013 all\nthree of the 2nd= players won their last\nround as well, chasing him all the way.\nThank you very much to Adam\nRaoof (our esteemed FIDE arbiter),\nthe Imperial College Chess Club, the\nUnion and all the players for making\nthe event incredibly enjoyable and\nmemorable.\nImperial College Chess Congress\nJohn Sargent\nIC Chess Congress Organiser\nJOHN SARGENT\n\n"

Nominated for the Nobel Peace\nPrize at the age of 16 and named as one of the\n100 most in\ufb02uential people in the World this\nyear. So I went along to a talk she was doing at\nthe Southbank Centre to \ufb01nd out more about her\nwork, not only out of curiosity but also because\nI suspected that she had a few tips for those of\nus like me who are very interested in helping\ndeveloping countries, but are often without the\nplatform to do so.\nShe arrived on the stage as a small and\nunimposing \ufb01gure, in stark contrast to the\n\ufb02amboyant and verbose question master who\npreceded her. As the questioner chatted away,\nshe quietly adjusted her headscarf until the time\ncame to respond to a question about how she got\ninvolved in her cause and why it was so important.\nMalala\u2019sresponsebeganwithaquickexplanation\nof why she thought that it was so important to\neducate the uneducated children, especially\ngirls, all over the world. The UN set as one of its\nMillennium Development Goals the promise that\nall children would have the right to an education.\nIn this respect they have utterly failed, with over\n50 million children worldwide still without the\nmost basic standards of primary education. She\nchallenged this failure, bringing out a key point\nthat others either choose to ignore or bury under\nstrange statistics. For this, the audience could not\nhelp but admire her courage, demonstrated by the\nfrequent applause.\nHer solution was that instead of trying to \ufb01nd\na way around the cultural sensitivities from the\noutside, as the UN does, that we should try and\nencourage people like her to change the cultural\nsensitivities from within. Although it would have\nbeen scandalous for an outsider to suggest that\nthere are outdated views in the world that need\nto be done away with, I found that her suggestion\nwas really something that I had felt for a long\ntime, and I suspect I am not alone in that opinion.\nHer \ufb01nal point came to discussing how we in\nthe West who wanted to make di\ufb00erence could.\nOn this point she made mention of what we might\nterm the \u2018haters\u2019 \u2013 people who are opposed to\ndevelopment of the third world, people that those\nof us involved in not-for-pro\ufb01t work are all too\nfamiliar with. I have often wondered how to deal\nwith them, as at times it often seems too much\nto put up with. Her acceptance of their opinions\nand their refusal to believe her story or support\nher work and to not let it get to her were rather\namazing, especially given how much she\u2019s gone\nthrough.\nBy the end of the hour I was really quite amazed\nat what I had heard. I went in to the hall expecting\na slightly media-hyped girl with an interesting\nstory who had done some good work, and came\nout amazed at how passionately and well she\ndelivered her points. It will be interesting to see\nhow things progress, and whether she manages\nto follow through on her promises to make a\ndi\ufb00erence.\nTo the Power of Ten:\nCharity Week is back!\nHannah Janebdar\nJawaad Farooq & Hazem El-Turk\nT\nhis year Imperial Hub is hosting\nan exciting fortnightly series of\ninteractive talks kicking o\ufb00 on\nthe 31st of October at 6:00pm in\nHuxley LT 144 with an insight\ninto the very big issue of Social Isolation in\nLondon and ways of combatting it. With\nour much awaited talk on Humanitarian Aid\nin Syria by Louay El-Adeb from Syria Relief\ntaking place on November 7th.\nLondoners are infamous for their cold\nindi\ufb00erence but social isolation in London\nis even more prevalent than commonly\nperceived and isn\u2019t just an a\ufb04iction of\nthe elderly, it a\ufb00ects a wealth of di\ufb00erent\npeople including students. Helping tackle\nloneliness and social isolation therefore\nis one of the aims of Imperial Hub\u2019s Local\nAction Committee who have organised\nthe \ufb01rst event in The Series\u2019 line up. The\nworkshop will inform students of the issue\nand the projects that already exist within\nand without the college to combat social\nisolation.\nGoing from the local to the global, in\ntrue Hub style, the second talk of The\nSeries is from Imperial Hub\u2019s International\nDevelopment Committee, focusing on\nhumanitarian aid in Syria, a country in\nthe midst of one of its most trying times\nin history. The talk will be given by Syria\nRelief\u2019s Louay El Adeb who will provide\nan insight into the key issues on the topic\nbefore opening the \ufb02oor to questions for\ndiscussion.\nThe Series is here to promote student\nawareness of current social, ethical and\nenvironmental issues across Imperial Hub\u2019s\nseven action branches. For any student\nwho has ever wanted to know more or do\nmore to make a positive social impact and\nhelp shape a better world, The Series is the\nperfect springboard.\nThe Imperial Series\nCharity Week o\ufb03cially starts this Saturday\n26th, it\u2019s a week that will leave you with\nsome of your fondest memories of your\ntime at Imperial, as well as many lifelong\nfriendships.\nIt really says it all in the name. Charity\nWeek (CW) is a week of student led non-stop\naction to help raise money for orphans and\nneedy children worldwide. This campaign is\norganised by the Islamic Society (ISoc) and\nis conducted in partnership with the UK\nbased charity Islamic relief, a global disaster\nrelief charity that is part of the national DEC\n(Disasters Emergency Committee).\nIn 2012, we the students at Imperial\nmanaged to raise a humongous \u00a347,478, all\nwith your help! This was more than 10% of\nthe national total (over 100 institutions!),\nwho raised a collective \u00a3448,401!\nSowhereexactlydidthemoneygolastyear?\nFirstly, the decision was made collectively by\nus \u2013 the students. In 2012, it was estimated\nthat 62,576 children in the Gaza Strip had\ntheir futures reduced to literal rubble with\ndamage to schools there. \u00a3154,500 was\ntherefore allocated to rebuilding six schools\nin that region, which enabled the educating\nof over 4,500 children, who can now look\nforward to brighter futures. Furthermore,\nwith the Syrian civil war taking its toll on\ntens of thousands of children (leading the\nUN to declare it as the \u2018worst humanitarian\ncrisis of the century\u2019), psychological and\neducational support worth \u00a374,400 was\nduly allocated here. And these are just\ntwo examples. Orphan sponsorship and\nhealthcare initiatives were also established\nin many other countries, including Kosovo,\nSri Lanka, Afghanistan, China and Pakistan.\nBut that was 2012. This is 2013.\nSo what\u2019s on? Street/ tube collections,\na \u2018Battle of the Societies\u2019 Quiz Night (get\nyour teams in before Sunday!), \u2018Mid-week\nMadness\u2019 sponsorship night, mountain\nclimbing, bungee jumping, cycle riding,\nassault courses and sky diving. The annual\n\u2018Smoky not Smudgy\u2019 women\u2019s pampering\nday is also back, promising to be bigger and\nbetter this year. All of this, plus much more!\nThe highlight of the week will be the Charity\nDinner on Thursday 31st October, held in\nthe prestigious Porchester Hall this year,\nwhich will have many inspiring speakers\nattending, as well as our legendary charity\nauction (which can see cakes go for over\n\u00a31,000!).\nSo come and join us, sponsor an event,\nvolunteer at a stall, run 5k for charity or test\nyour wits in a sky dive! Check out the o\ufb03cial\nImperial Charity Week Facebook page for\nevents and dates, \ufb01nd us on Twitter for\nregular updates, and don\u2019t forget to buy your\ntickets for the Dinner at the union website!\nContact Sarim to see how you can get\ninvolved (ss9111@ic.ac.uk).\nWriter\n\u201c\u00a3154,500\nwas therefore\nallocated to\nrebuilding six\nschools in that\nregion, which\nenabled the\neducating of over\n4,500 children,\nwho can now\nlook forward to\nbrighter futures.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "13\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 25 OCT\nARTS\nKamil McCelland explores one of the world\u02bcs leading art fairs\nMore Than A Hipster Art Safari\nRICHARD HUBERT SMITH\nCho Chang Goes To Work in a Chinese Factory\nLily Le\nWriter\nWhat: The World of Extreme\nHappiness\nWhere: The National Theatre Shed\nWhen: Until 26 October 2013,\ntickets still available\nPrice: \u00a312 to \u00a320, \u00a35 with the 16-25\nEntry Pass Scheme\nCould it be that there is no other play\nwith a more sarcastic title than The\nWorld of Extreme Happiness?\nThe play begins with two Chinese\nmen, complete with dirt on their faces\nobviously to signify their countryside\norigins, foul-mouthing about whores\nand pigeons excreting in their mouths.\nFrustration is the main emotion felt\nby all characters, and it manifests\nitself in the aggressive yet nonchalant\nswearing which many born into manic\nChinese households will probably be\nhabituated to.\nChina is a land of shock and\nstupefaction, according to the media.\nBut The World of Extreme Happiness\ntakes us through all this, from the\nattempted murder of Sunny (Katie\nLeung, perhaps better known as\nCho Chang of Harry Potter fame)\nat her birth \u2013 among hundreds of\nothers mentioned \u2013 because she is\na girl born into a one-child policy,\nto the powerlessness of the country\nfolk without access to education\nand eventually enslaved in a mass-producing factory. The audience\nhears of the brutality of Mao and the\ncontinued power of the state to crush\nanything or anyone letting o\ufb00 a mere\nwhi\ufb00 of de\ufb01ance.\nIt is interesting to consider these\nevents of the play in the context of the\nreality of contemporary China. What\nare the real impacts on the people\nthat the policies are directly a\ufb00ecting\ntoday?\nLooking around the audience, it\nseemed that there were more East\nAsian members compared to other\nplays I have attended, which usually\nconsist of the white middle class en\nmasse. For me, being third generation\nChinese not to be born in China, it\nwas rather fun to identify with some\nof the behaviour, mannerisms, and\nattitudes of the family members that\nre\ufb02ected those of my own. I wondered\nwhat those with stronger links to\nChina and its history thought of the\nmore controversial events acted out.\nIntense and shocking, it would\nnot be the same without a bit of\norgasm, kidnap, attempted suicide,\nand murder. A rapid-heart-rate-inducing \ufb02ashing rainbow light and\nvibrating bass reinforced the mania of\nthe city life of Shenzhen. Doll babies\nmanufactured by the featured factory\nwere lit up and \ufb02ashed in an eerie way\nnext to a kitsch \ufb01sh tank.\nThe staging and direction (Michael\nLonghurst) were the de\ufb01nite\nhighlights. In such an intimate venue\nas The Shed, the change of setting\nfrom countryside to factory to police\nstation, and more, is carried out\nperfectly. At one point, the birth of a\nbaby is represented by ripping a doll\nT\nhe Frieze Art Fair, now in its\n11thyear,isoneoftheworld\u2019s\nleading contemporary art\nfairs, and has helped shape\nLondon into a nucleus of\ncreativity and vision.\nThis year, 152 galleries were invited\nto assemble in one space in Regent\u2019s\npark, and display the best of what\nthey could o\ufb00er. And they did not\ndisappoint; from Tokyo to New York,\ntogether they brought an international\nfeel to the fair and gave it dynamism\ntruly unique to Frieze. This diversity\nmakes for a thrilling and eye-opening\nexperience where you do not know\nwhat to expect from one gallery to\nanother.\nBut the true beauty of Frieze is that\nit showcases artists currently at the\nforefront of innovation, the ones that\nare de\ufb01ning what the future of art shall\nbe. Frieze Frame, a specialist section\nof the fair, o\ufb00ers less established\ngalleries a chance to exhibit a single\nartist in depth and, for me, this is\nwhere you really saw the innovation.\nHere, up-and-coming artists have an\nopportunity to display their works\nand you are really able to see how\nart is evolving, especially when you\ncompare it to the older contemporary\nart elsewhere at the fair.\nAs you walk into the fair\u2019s main\npavilion, it is as if you are walking into\nanother world, a world that leaves\nbehind the hectic reality outside and\nsuspends you in a white bubble of\nimagination. Unobtrusive lighting and\narchitecture create a cloud of clean\nminimalism, perfectly designed to\ndisplay art of any kind, and expansive\nspace allows viewing without any\nintrusion on your intimate experience\nof the art.\nThe people of Frieze are almost as\nintriguing as the art itself. To see a\nman in platforms, a fur coat and Viking\nhelmet adds to the bizarre spectacle.\nYou feel it is an opportunity for all the\narty types of London to \ufb02aunt their\nstu\ufb00 \u2013 or maybe they are seeing just\nhow far you can push de\ufb01nitions of art\nand fashion. But it does create vitality\nand a playful \u2013 if not a tad surreal \u2013\natmosphere that really enhances my\nyearly pilgrimage to Frieze.\nThe idea of people as art is not\njust limited to how visitors dress. A\nnumber of interactive works included\nthe viewer as an integral part, none\nmore so than James Lee Byars\u2019 Four\nin a Dress. It is exactly how it sounds:\nfour people facing each other in a\ncircle, all wearing one dress. What I\nloved about this piece is how inclusive\nit was. The four people were allowed to\ntalk to one another and the audience,\ngiving everyone a slightly di\ufb00erent\nexperience.\nViewer participation seemed a\ncommon theme this year and Ian\nCheng\u2019s Entropy Wrangler Cloud gave\nit a modern, scienti\ufb01c feel. He created\na virtual world, viewed through\nsimulator goggles that immersed\nthe viewer in the new reality. The\ncomically large goggles and amazed\nexpressions on the participants\u2019 faces\nas they experienced this world made\nfor hilarious viewing.\nIn fact, alternate realities featured\nheavily as a concept this year,\nreinforcing the progressive modernity\nof the fair. Because so much of our\ndaily lives are now online and virtual,\nthis art felt up-to-date and was thus\ninstantly relatable.\nIn the end, the idea of a fair is to sell\nart. But that was never really obvious\nat Frieze, bar the huddle of curators\nyou would see every so often. It was\nheartening to see the artists were also\nnot too preoccupied by the \ufb01nancial\nside of art. They did not ostensibly\ncreate works that would be an easy sell,\nfor example Jennifer Rubell\u2019s Portrait\nof the Artist; a gigantic sculpture of a\npregnant woman where you are meant\nto crawl inside her womb. Not the\nmost practical of pieces\u2026 However,\nwith the Tate buying four works from\nthis year\u2019s fair, maybe there is a market\nfor the kind of piece that doesn\u2019t quite\n\ufb01t on a rich patron\u2019s wall.\nThe Frieze Art Fair really is a key\ncultural event and I can only see\nit becoming bigger and even more\nin\ufb02uential. It really is cutting edge,\nand is shaping the future of art as\nwe know it. And despite the hefty\nentrance fee (\u00a323 for students!), it has\nbecome not only a signi\ufb01cant hub for\ncontemporary art, but also the kind of\nchic place any young Londoner would\nwant to be seen.\nThe Frieze art fair this year took\nplace 17th \u2013 20th October. The fair is\nheld annually in Regent\u2019s Park, NW1,\nentrance \u00a332, students \u00a323.\nout of a cardboard box... I\u2019ll go with\nthat.\nAlthough the cast of 6 used to play\nat least 12 characters was successful\nthanks to such work, the actors did\nnot match it so perfectly. At points\nthey made it di\ufb03cult to accept this\nexaggerated reality was, well, a\npotential reality.\nThe ending (spoiler alert), an\nimitation of One Flew Over the\nCuckoo\u2019s Nest, seemed to mimic\nthe way a friend of mine pretended\nto \ufb02ap around whilst mocking the\nsu\ufb00ocation of characters such as the\none in question. This professional\nversion was almost as laughable. But\noverall, with a slight polish, Frances\nYa-Chu-Chowig\u2019s work could \ufb01t\namongst contemporary masterpieces.\nLINDA NYLAND \u00a9 FRIEZE\nLINDA NYLAND \u00a9 FRIEZE\n\n"

    "content": "16 FRIDAY 25 OCT\nMUSIC\nEditor: Simon Hunter,\nRiaz Agahi, Stuart\nMasson, William\nStocker\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nLive Review - London Grammar\nFred Fyles has an ambivalent experience at Electric Brixton\ns they play, the screens\nbehind London\nGrammar display visuals of flocks of birds,\nand wisps of smoke;\nthese are perhaps perfect representations of their music.\nTransient and fleeting, most of the\ntracks on their debut album If You\nWait begin minimally, swelling to a\ncrescendo as the different elements\ncome together, before ending as\nquickly and quietly as it began.\nWith her piercing stare, blonde\nhair, and low vocal range, singer\nHannah Reid may at first seem\nlike a British Nico; but instead of\nan icy teutonic delivery, her voice\nhas a warm, more soulful quality,\nreminiscent of Sade Adu or Jessie\nWare. She is joined by guitarist Dan\nRothman and multi-instrumentalist\n- playing synth, drums, and djembe\n- Dot Major, who wrap their sounds\naround Reid\u2019s forceful, mournful\nmelodies to create restrained, almost polite electronic pop.\nDespite their meteoric ascent\ninto success (they\u2019ve only been releasing music for 10 months), the\nband don\u2019t seem to be fazed as they\ncome onto the stage to rapturous\napplause.\nImmediately they plunge into\n\u2018Hey Now\u2019, which has Reid at her\nmost elemental, as if she is channeling some kind of ancient spirit. It\nis only after the third song that they\nbreak their stand-offish composure,\nand Reid lets us know how nervous\nshe was before coming on stage; she\ntells us how glad she is to be back in\nLondon after their extensive American tour - \u2018American crowds are\ngreat, but they\u2019re just so... rowdy\u2019\nshe explains.\nA\nIt is unlikely that they will have\nthis problem here, since the audience seem captivated through-out, with barely anyone daring to\nruin the atmosphere by dancing.\nOnly \u2018Strong\u2019, one of their standout\ntracks, has people singing along.\nThe band move through the\nsongs relatively quickly, pausing infrequently to chat to the audience,\nmostly about how their time in the\nStates was. The songs, which deal\nwith the intricacies of youth, and the\ntransition from teenager to adulthood seem to resound well with the\naudience, who seem to be mainly in\ntheir early 20s. In \u2018Metal and Dust\u2019,\nslightly chilly synth chords accompany Reid\u2019s pure voice, as she dissects the trappings of an unsatisfying relationship. \u2018We argue, we don\u2019t\nfight\u2019, she croons, and this non-con-frontational attitude is reflected in\nthe music, which seems to meander\nwithout actually going anywhere; in\ncontrast, their pensive tune \u2018Wasting My Young Years\u2019 combines a\nminimal guitar line with piano and\na sudden burst of drums, growing\ninto a climax and then suddenly petering out to rapturous applause.\nDespite Reid\u2019s compelling vocal performance, London Grammar seem to be inhabiting a genre\n- minimal R&B influenced electronica - that for the last few years has\nbecome completely saturated. With\ntheir precise guitar lines and use of\nspace within composition, the band\ninvite inevitable comparisons to\nThe XX, another three-piece creating melancholic pop. While Reid\nmay bring something new to the ta-AMS album of the week\nFirst, some honesty, I chose to review this album because I expected it\nto be really bad. The hype died years\nago for Sleigh Bells, and I\u2019ve yet to\nfind a positive review of this one. I fancied tearing this apart in the written\npress, because that is what makes me\nfeel big. I\u2019m disappointed on all levels.\nIt\u2019s not quite bad enough to completely tear apart, but it\u2019s not good either.\nSleigh Bells basically got noticed\nfor being loud. Whereas most noise\npop bands take their cues from alt. favourites like My Bloody Valentine and\nPavement, on their debut record Treats, Sleigh Bells\u2019 big chunky riffs were\nreminiscent of the likes of Metallica and Guns n Roses. It was fresh, it was\nexciting, it was a bit of a gimmick. Two records later, it\u2019s hard to know what to\ndo. Their second record, Reign of Terror, tried to develop the big loud sound\nwith limited success. As with all bands based on a gimmick, when everyone\ngets bored of it, what do you do?\nThey decided to chuck it. The worst thing is, there\u2019s a few tracks that would\nreally suit a big chunky guitar tone, and it\u2019s a real shame it\u2019s not there. \u2018Sing\nLike a Wire\u2019 and \u2018Tiger Kit\u2019 are painfully bland, while \u2018Minnie\u2019, \u2018Sugarcane\u2019\nand \u2018Bitter Rivals\u2019 aren\u2019t much further ahead. The riffs are clearly superb and\nwithabitofmusclecouldcarrythesetracks,butinsteadthey\u2019rehiddenunder\nlayers of dull synths. If the whole record was like this, I would have removed\nthe MP3s from my laptop and this review would be more swear words than\nanything else. Sadly, the synths do work on the rest of the tracks. In fact, on\n\u201824\u2019 especially, the synths really work. It\u2019s pretty dream pop vocals and synths\nwith chunky drums. It\u2019s not going to set the world alight, but it\u2019s certainly an\ninteresting listen.\nI can see why this is getting uniformly panned. It\u2019s an easy target. It\u2019s a previous hype band desperately trying to find a new niche. At points, it is awful.\nOverall,itreallyisn\u2019tthatbadthough.Iadmit,I\u2019mprobablynotgoingtolisten\nto it ever again, and I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anybody, but you\nknow, it could be a lot worse.\nSleigh Bells - Bitter Rivals\nStuart Masson\nfrom which they emerged; having\nbeen together less than a year, their\nalbum was the bookie\u2019s choice for\nthe Mercury Prize before it was even\nreleased (they didn\u2019t even make the\nshortlist).\nWith the ghosts of former flash-in-the-pan acts (Little Boots, any-one?) there is a great amount of pressure for the trio to not only succeed,\nbut excel. Whether they manage to\nsurvive this cycle of hype boom and\nbust long enough to record a second\nalbum remains to be seen, but as of\nyet it remains near-impossible to\nlive up to their reputation.\nEarly on in the evening Reid\napologises for their tiredness, saying\nthat they are still slightly jetlagged;\ntheir music seems to reflect this,\nand at the end of the 50 minutes or\nso in which they play, their sound\nalready begins to feel dull. Hopefully the band will begin to develop\nonce the hype has died down, but for\nnow, it just feels a bit like something\nis missing.\nble, the music is almost overwhelmingly controlled, and at some points\nseems staid and clinical; perhaps the\nbest way I can think to describe the\nkind of music they make is \u2018Dinner\nParty Music\u2019, a phrase that reflects\ntheir restrained style - for better or\nworse.\nUnfortunately, it is difficult for\nsuch music to translate to a live set-ting; as the evening goes on, it seems\nto me that Reid\u2019s voice is something of\na double-edged sword. It is incredibly\nunique, but in comparison the backing drums and guitar seem placid,\neven bland. Their cover of Kavinsky\u2019s\nexcellent song \u2018Nightcall\u2019, featured on\nthe album, is a stripped down ver-sion, that lacks all of the tension and\nslight menace that made the original\nso compelling. Nothing quite matches\nthe opening number, in which Reid\u2019s\nvoice was left pretty much to its own\ndevices to fill the stage.\nIt is impossible to talk about\nLondon Grammar without mentioning the unstoppable hype machine\n\n"

(Probably\nthe only actress who can top Winslet\nin this respect is Nicole Kidman) And\na part of what makes Labour Day so\nintriguing is what the actors make of\ntheir highly unusual but fascinating\ncharacters.\nAs a divorced single mother to a son,\nAdele (Winslet) has become detached\nfrom the world. She doesn\u2019t like to\nleave the house unless absolutely\nnecessary and she depends more and\nmore on the young Henry (the excellent young actor Gattlin Griffith)\naround the house.\nThis all changes when random encounter with a convicted murderer on\nthe run in a supermarket. As a post-appendicectomy patient, Frank (Josh\nBrolin) jumped out of his hospital\nwindow, escaping with some injuries\nand now has found the perfect place\nto crash and lay low for a few days.\nAdele and Henry reluctantly take him\nin, and at first this is fuelled by Frank\u2019s\nrather non-subtle threats against Henry, as he gently places his hand around\nthe back of the young boy\u2019s neck.\nBut this is where things get interest-ing: Adele, longing for a male companion to fill the emptiness in her life,\nstarts to see Frank in a very positive\nlight. Henry, who\u2019s been missing a\nfather figure for some years now (his\nbiological father (Clark Gregg) does\ntake him out for dinner once per week\nwith his new family but there\u2019s not\nmuch bonding here), begins to form a\nspecial relationship with Frank.\nAnd really, who can blame them?\nFar from the initial appearance of a\nscruffy-looking prisoner on the loose,\nit would appear Frank is quite the domestic god, fixing every little thing\naround the house, he even cooks,\nbakes (a sumptuous-looking peach\npie), and irons too (shirtless, of course,\nhow else?). It\u2019s a nice day outside? Let\u2019s\ngo play some baseball with the kid.\nAnd sure why not fire up the barbecue\nand spend an idyllic summer day with\nthe kind strangers?\nDespite the various local news\nwarning screens flashing from Adele\u2019s\ntelevision, Frank insists there are two\nsides to every story, and as the intermittent flashback sequences (in which\nthe younger version of Frank is played\nby the Josh Brolin doppelganger Tom\nLipinski) begin to reveal, we begin to\nrealise that Frank has a point. And\nwith Brolin\u2019s balanced performance\nof a tough exterior and his exuding\nkind-hearted nature, Frank becomes a\nfar more intriguing character over the\ncourse of the film.\nIt\u2019s a scenario that perhaps requires\na stretch of the imagination \u2014 any\nsensible person with a child would\nmost likely have caused a scene in the\nsupermarket. But given Adele\u2019s past,\nand Winslet\u2019s spot-on portrayal, you\nbegin to see the attraction and all the\nfuss with this weird but oddly touching relationship.\nSeen through the eyes of the young\nboy, the audience also gets to see life\noutside the house as Henry starts\nhanging out with a newly-local girl\nwho is far more mature than you\nwould expect for someone her age.\nThere is sweet, light-hearted humour\nas we see the coming-of-age story of\nHenry in the most unusual circum-stances, and it\u2019s the many character\ninteractions that give the film plenty\nof life.\nThe sunny, picture-perfect life they\nlead only lasts the short and bittersweet Labour Day Weekend, a warm,\nfantasy affair that is cut short thanks\nto an overly friendly neighbour who\nbarges in (Brooke Shields), and an\noverly caring cop (James Van Der\nBeek) who, in all fairness, is only trying to help. It becomes unbearably\ntense, as the stakes become higher\nthan ever, and this family unit is one\nworth rooting for.\nThe closing scenes feel a touch con-trived, and even in Tobey Maguire\u2019s\nsurprise last-minute appearance there\nis very little justification for an ending that makes you cringe. It\u2019s heartwarming to a certain point, but as\nthe film starts to milk the finale more\nand more, the last few minutes come\nat a price of having to overlook some\nquestionable narrative leaps.\nLast week, it was announced that\nGravity, the space-age thriller with\nSandra Bullock and George Clooney,\nhad topped the US box office for a second week in a row. Epic, sumptuous,\nand in 3D to boot, Gravity seems to\nreflect the current cinematic climate\nof \u2018bigger is better\u2019. As films like The\nAvengers and Iron Man 3 rake it in at\nthe movie theatres, directors that eschew such bombastic visuals, looking\ninstead to the past for inspiration, appear to be doing something risky and\nexperimental. Pawel Pawlikowski is\none such director, and his contribution to the London Film Festival, Ida,\nis a bold and thoughtful masterpiece.\nPoland. 1962. Anna (Agata Trzebuchowska) is a novice nun, preparing\nto take her vows and commit herself\nto a life of solitude. But before she can\ndo this, her mother superior makes\nher visit her sole surviving relative, a\nformer high-powered judge known\nby the moniker \u2018Red Wanda\u2019, but\nnow fallen from grace, made to solve\npetty squabbles between neighbours.\nPlayed by the brilliant veteran of Polish cinema, Agata Kulesza, Wanda is\nlike a fish out of water in communist\nPoland. Frequently drunk, sexually\nliberated, and disrespectful of author-ity, she seems to be an embarrassment\nto both Anna and the government.\nIda\nDirector: Pawel Pawlikowski\nWriters: Pawel Pawlikowski,\nRebecca Lenkiewicz\nStarring: Agata Kulesza, Agata\nTrzebuchowska, Dawid Ogrodnik\nRuntime: 80 minutes\nFred Fyles\nWriter\nNot long after arriving, Anna\u2019s aunt\ndrops two major bombshells - firstly,\nAnna\u2019s real name is Ida, and secondly,\nshe was born into a jewish family, who\nwere all murdered during the Holocaust, with the exception of Wanda\nand Ida. Being the only ones left, they\nbegin a sort of road-trip across Poland, trying to locate where their family\u2019s bodies are buried. Along the way,\nIda is exposed to the beauty of John\nColtrane and sexual desire, but also\nthe horrors of the Second World War,\nwhich she was too young to properly\nremember. For Wanda on the other\nhand, the war has never ended; with\ncollaborators and executioners still\nliving free in Poland, she still feels like\nan enemy in her own country.\nShot beautifully in black and white,\nwith a 4:3 aspect ration, Ida may\ndraw comparisons to last year\u2019s Oscar breakout The Artist; but while The\nArtist drew its inspiration from the\nglamour and glitz of the 1920s, Ida is\ncut from a different, much more austere cloth. Reminiscent of Truffaut\nand Jean Luc-Godard, two darlings\nof the French New Wave, Ida charts\na smooth course through a turbulent\nand changing world.\nNewcomer Trzebuchowska is brilliant as Ida; sheltered by the convent\nall her life, she is now exposed to the\nconfusing world beyond its walls. Ida\nviews her environment with a wide-eyed wonder, but hidden underneath\nis an astute understanding of what the\nPolish public expect from her, both as\na nun, and as a woman. With numerous long, pensive shots, Pawlikowski\nhas built up a visual language that,\nalthough indebted to his fellow European contemporaries Bela Tarr and\nRoman Polanski, is entirely his own.\nHe takes on the big themes of anti-semitism, loss, catholicism, and the\nhorrors of war in this little gem of a\nfilm. Both rich and austere, cold and\nheartfelt, Ida is a bleak but moving\nslice of life from a forgotten world.\nLess is more\n\n"

    "content": "18 FRIDAY 25 OCT\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nInside Llewyn Davis\nDirector: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen\nWriters: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen\nStarring: Oscar Isaac, Carey\nMulligan, Justin Timberlake, John\nGoodman, Garrett Hedlund\nRuntime: 111 minutes\nCertification: R (USA)\nHe lives for the applause, applause, applause\nTo say that Under the Skin is a marmite\nfilm would be an understatement.\nWhen Jonathan Glazer\u2019s first directorial effort in 9 years was shown at the\nVenice Film Festival it was met with\na mixture of cheers and boos; Xan\nBrooks of the Guardian gave it five\nstars, and called it \u201cthe best film in the\ncompetition by far\u201d, while the Independent called it \u201claughably bad\u201d. But\nas the credits start to roll during this\nshowing at the London Film Festival,\nthe deathly silence that has bathed the\nauditorium is broken, by the sound of\nthunderous, rapturous applause.\nBeginning with a Kubrickian sequence of what appears to be objects\nin space, but turns out to be an eye,\nUnder the Skin tells the tale of a mysterious alien who roams around Glasgow, picking up men in its van and entombing them in a dark abyss. Scarlett\nJohansson plays the creature to per-Scar Jo gets under your skin\nfection, surveying the world she sees\naround her with an indifferent lack of\nunderstanding; subverting the classic\nidea of a femme fatale, she tempts men\ninto her web, her eyes remaining dead\nbelow her vampy wig. Taking care to\nchoose the loners of society \u2014 those\nwithout girlfriends or family; those\nwho won\u2019t be missed \u2014 she tempts\nthem forward, like some kind of ancient goddess, before they are submerged in a viscous liquid, black as an\noil slick.\nBased upon the book of the same\nname by Michael Faber, Glazer has\ndissected away any unneeded plot\ndetails, keeping explanation to a mini-mum. Following the creature around\nis a motorbike rider, credited only\nas \u2018The Bad Man\u2019. Whether he is her\ncarer, employer, or something more\nsinister, we never find out. When the\ncreature meets a man with a facial\ndeformity, as much of an outcast as\nshe is, an element of humanity is introduced that begins to spread like a\nvirus. She tries to fit in, but the all-too-human emotions, experiences,\nand sexuality get stuck in her throat\nlike the cake she attempts to eat.\nFilmed covertly using a series of\ncameras developed specially for the\nfilm, Johansson interacts with Glaswegian locals, unaware that they are\nappearing in a film, taking the voyeurism to an almost-Hitchcock level; we\nare watching Her, watching Them,\nwho are watching Her, all through a\nmiasma of cold sweat. These cameras turn the streets of Glasgow into\nan alien terrain; transform a crowded\nnightclub into a claustrophobic hell,\nentombed in dry ice and sweat.\nThe dramatic hills and seas surrounding Glasgow form the perfect\nbackdrop to Glazer\u2019s dark vision, with\na stormy beachfront being the setting\nfor one of the film\u2019s most dramatic and\nmemorable scenes. The alienation Johansson experiences is perfectly ex-pressed, so much so that in certain\npoints in the film normal behaviours\ntake on a surreal air. Locals smoke,\neat, and laugh; but Glazer creates a\nbarrier in front of the audience, scrutinizing human life through the lens.\nWhile Johansson\u2019s finely tuned performance is at the centre of the film,\nthe real star is the soundtrack by\ncomposer Mica Levi. A cacophony\nof strings, synth, and drums create\na tangible air of menace \u2014 imagine\nsomething along the lines of The Knife\ncrossed with Bernard Herrmann, all\nimagined in the mind of David Lynch.\nOther Lynchian comparisons can be\nmade when we look at the meticulous\nsound design; the outside world is\nmuted, dulled, making the interior of\nthe van seem like a spacecraft in which\nthe creature drifts, cold and alone.\nThe only way to accurately describe\nthis film would be \u2018an experience\u2019. It\nmight not be an experience you enjoy,\nbut it is one that stays with you long\nafter the credits have rolled. Taking on\nthe big questions about what it means\nto experience alienation, Glazer has\ncreated a work that lures you in and\ndrags you under, down into the abyss.\nUnder the Skin\nDirector: Jonathan Glazer\nWriters: Walter Campbell, Jonathan\nGlazer, Michele Faber (novel)\nStarring: Scarlett Johansson, Paul\nBrannigan\nRuntime: 107 minutes\nFred Fyles\nWriter\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nLlewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) may be a\ntalented performer with the voice of\nan angel, but his commercial viability\nsimply isn\u2019t there, it seems. Wandering around the cold winter streets\nof New York in the 1960s trying to\ncatch some sort of a lucky break in\nthe notoriously tough music industry,\nLlewyn is a lonely, hopeful wannabe\nwho doesn\u2019t belong. Couch-hopping\nin his friends\u2019 flats has become a daily\nroutine for the struggling artist, and a\nstring of bad lucks that finds him over\nthe next few days makes him question\nwhether it is really worth sticking with\nhis dream and ambition of becoming a\nsuccessful recording artist.\nThe new film from the Coen brothers is certainly as funny as it is tragic.\nLlewyn starts the day by losing his\nfriend\u2019s cat, then he\u2019s informed by his\nmarried lover (Carey Mulligan \u2014 on\nentertainingly fiery form) that she\u2019s\npregnant, needing an abortion he\u2019s going to have to pay for. He\u2019s not getting\nenough gigs to support himself, there\nis a huge box of his recorded singles\nthat failed to sell and probably never\nwill, and his music manager doesn\u2019t\nseem too bothered with him and advancing his career.\nAs he travels through the folk music\nscene, the audience is in for the journey of a lifetime; with the nostalgic period mood, backed by some outstanding songs, all sung live by the actors\nthemselves (who knew Isaac could\nsing this well?), the Coens introduce\nus to a world and a genre of music you\nprobably never knew existed but will\nembrace whole-heartedly.\nLots of humour follow as everything\nslowly but surely falls apart for our\nprotagonist - but this is laughter coming from the most natural, everyday\nplaces, not having to force the characters into bizarre or unconvincing scenarios in any way.\nIt\u2019s Llewyn\u2019s \u2018Odyssey\u2019 (the name\nUlysses even pops up once), as he encounters friends, enemies and strangers over the course of a few days, and\nat the heart of all this Isaac is fantas-tic. Llewyn has the musical talent for\nsure, but years of very little success\nhas forced him to cope with so much,\nand the tired frustration of a meandering artist is shown brilliantly by\nthe actor. There is also more to be told\nwhen it comes to why he\u2019s now a solo\nact. It\u2019s touching, and Isaac\u2019s performance makes this sub-plot ever more\neffective.\nInside Llewyn Davis shows the inevitable path unknown artists will\neventually have to walk through. Having to face the realities of life, making\nthe tough compromises and sacrifices\nis difficult to face up to, and Llewyn\u2019s\ndreams and ambitions are what make\nit all the more challenging to stom-ach. The Coens are certainly in a low\nmood, but they go about it with perfectly timed humour, involving drama,\nand incredible performances to somewhat ease the pain.\n\n"

Children have been seen\nrunning around schoolyards\nin their new \u2018Murphy\u2019 jerseys.\nIndeed even some with \u2018Diaz\nRios\u2019 on their backs, showing\nhow the silkily skilled Spanish wonder\nkid has already endeared himself to the\nImperial fan base. Women have been\nseen frenzied outside Harlington,\ntrying to catch a glimpse of or maybe\neven touch the mid\ufb01eld hunks Alex\nDale and Tim \u2018Smithy\u2019 Beasley, though\nit must be mentioned that their most\nvociferous admirers seem to be each\nother\u2019s mothers. Grown men have\nalready told their wives that they are\nbusy henceforth on both Wednesdays\nand Saturdays; tackles from Hill and\ngoals from captain Robinson can\u2019t be\nmissed. Finally, after the 6 tortuous\nmonths of absence, Imperial football\nis back. All is right in the world again.\nAfter Imperial 1s\u2019 high-\ufb02ying season\n(though most games were travelled\nto by bus), media expectations were\nhigh of the possibility of more success,\nalthough the team\u2019s detractors would\nbe quick to point out that this is due\nto Felix articles being written by\nmembersoftheteam.However,having\nbeen promoted to a new division and\nwith the loss of both great players\nand inappropriate and oddly-timed\nnudity from the locker room, there\nwere legitimate questions as to how\nthe squad would cope in the loftier\nechelons of university football. Thus\nfar, those concerns appear unfounded.\nLast Wednesday, the team headed\ndown to Canterbury to face CCCU,\nwho had been relegated to our division\nrecently, though their relegation to\nthe bottom of university league tables\nhappened a while ago. Avid readers\nof 1s match reports may remember\nthe Odyssey that the team embarked\non to reach Canterbury. This time,\nhowever, thanks to the skilled driving\nof Robinson and the swag-\ufb01lled\nplaylist provided by full-time DJ and\npart-time mid\ufb01elder John Crawford,\nwe got there in a reasonable amount\nof time. Upon arrival in Canterbury,\nRobinson decided that we had made\nit in su\ufb03cient time to enjoy the\nscenery, and took us for a pleasant\ndrive through the \ufb01elds of Kent.\nWhilst it was well-meant, it was eerily\nreminiscent of Jeepers Creepers II,\nand we were all glad when the cultural\ntour of Kent ended.\nUponarrivalatthemuddybogCCCU\ncall their home (#fortressSwamp),\nthe team readied themselves for a\nchallenge. The cones were put out,\nand everyone concentrated on the\ntask at hand. Even Murphy, our\nresident David Attenborough, was too\nexcited to talk about or study the local\n\ufb02ora and fauna, which had previously\nso enthralled him. A rousing speech\nby Robinson left the team weeping in\ntears at its Chaucer-esque brilliance,\nwith some calling for its addition to\nthe 14th century masterpiece that is\nThe Canterbury Tales. After that, we\nplayed football.\nThe \ufb01rst twenty minutes was an\nexhibition of brilliance for Imperial.\nThe mid\ufb01elders Kola (can\u2019t spell\nhis surname), Crawford and the\ntalismanic \u2018Smithy\u2019 controlled the\ntempo of the game, o\ufb00ering options\nto the ever-present wingers Dale\nand Murphy. The full-backs Nugent\nand Nielsen pushed up, and the\ninterplay between these seven was\norgasmic; indeed some of the CCCU\ncheerleaders (you read right \u2013 there\nwere cheerleaders) were seen visibly\nweak at the knees, though that could\nhave been due to their proximity to\nDale, whose name so amused the\nopposing full-back marking him.\nImperial seemed fully in control,\nenjoying the majority of possession,\nwith the ball never seemingly never\nleaving the opposition\u2019s half. Then\ndisaster struck. A miscommunication\nby Keeper Owen during a CCCU foray\ninto our half allowed the opposition\u2019s\nstriker to nip in and score a well\n\ufb01nished header. Suddenly we were 1-0\ndown. Imperial were slightly de\ufb02ated,\nand the match became much more\nbalanced. The half continued fairly\nuneventfully, typical mesmerizing\nruns by Murphy and Dale aside.\nDefensively, the team was solid and\nlargely unthreatened, and was led by\nthe brilliant play of (reluctant) centre-back Johnny Hill.\nThe second half started well,\noverlapping runs from deep\nsupported by Nielsen and Nugent\nwere dangerous and applied constant\npressure to the opposition\u2019s defence.\nA beautiful free kick whipped in\nby Murphy found an anonymous\nImperial centre-back who ran from\ndeep and headed it under the keeper\nand into the net. The cheers of joy at\nhaving equalised were swiftly ended\nby the piercing sound of the ref\u2019s\nwhistle calling for o\ufb00side. Annoyance\ncaused more pressure to be mounted:\nRobinson, hot o\ufb00 4 goals in 20\nminutes in the pre-season mauling of\nUCL 2s (see the coroner\u2019s report last\nweek), had a series of half chances and\ncaused more problems for the defence\nthan they had encountered with basic\nliteracy tests, but frustratingly never\nquite had a quality opportunity to\nscore. Murphy had a few cracks on\ngoal, including a tantalisingly close\nopportunity almost latching on to a\nlong ball one-on-one with the keeper.\nThen, \ufb01nally, we equalised. There is\ndisagreement over the nature of the\ngoal. One person claims to have made\na 60 yard marauding run from centre-back shifting and turning like Ahmed\nCherif before curling it delicately into\nthe bottom of the net. Everyone else\nmaintains the ball was fumbled around\nin the 6-yard box, before being laid o\ufb00\nby Robinson to the aforementioned\nanonymous centre-back who stroked\nit into the goal with what may have\nbeen actually his \ufb01rst touch. Despite\nthis controversy, the ball went over\nthe line and, to paraphrase Orwell, all\ngoals are created equal.\nAt 1-1 Imperial controlled the\ngame, rarely looking under threat.\nHowever, not enough pressure was\nmounted to score again, and Imperial\nhad to make do with a draw. The pain\nof not winning a match we dominated\nwas o\ufb00set by the joys of watching\nGerman debutant Max \u2018friends with\nMarius\u2019 do countless step overs, often\nwith nobody close to him, sometimes\neven without the ball during the last\n15 or so minutes of play. However,\nImperial\u2019s strong showing proved that\nwe are a force to be reckoned with in\nthis league and, to quote what Chris\nNielsen heard from the opposition\nin the showers, we\u2019ll \u2018be up there at\nthe end of the season\u2019. These kind\nwords were despite the acrimonious\nrelationship developed between the\nsides during the game. Robinson and\nCrawford were embroiled in some\nrather nasty name calling with one\nmember of the opposition, including\ndeep-cutting insults such as \u2018you\naren\u2019t very good\u2019 or \u2018you\u2019re ugly\u2019.\nIndeed some e\ufb00eminate pushing and\nshoving was also observed. Man of the\nmatch went to Hill for his tenacious\nand controlling display, redemption\nafter the red card he received\nagainst CCCU last year. (Completely\nunsubstantiated) Rumour has it that\nRobinson is considering making Hill\u2019s\nmove to centre-back permanent.\nNext was Saturday, where Imperial\nfaced their rivals, the Medics.\nRivalries are meant for teams of equal\nstature and hostile relationships. The\ngame proved to have neither of the\nprerequisites required to ful\ufb01l the\nde\ufb01nition of a rivalry, as the tone of\nthe match was good natured and\nICUAFC\ncontinued on page 38 >>\n\n"

Jose\nMourinho still doesn\u2019t know his best\nteam, but will be encouraged by how\nhis summer signings are performing.\nCity haven\u2019t improved away from\nhome since the arrival of Manuel\nPellegrini and are badly missing\nVincent Kompany at the back. They\nhave to push for a win in games like\nthis and I wonder if that might just\nplay into Chelsea\u2019s hands. The Blues\nare traditionally strong at home and\nknow how to win big matches.\nPrediction: 2-1\nSunderland v Newcastle\n(Sunday 1:30pm, Sky Sports 1)\nGus Poyet learnt last weekend\nthe sheer magnitude of the task he\nfaces. He has to stop the rot fast, but\nwill need to summon up some team\nspirit because the quality isn\u2019t there.\nNewcastle, meanwhile, seem to have\nclicked since that shocking \ufb01rst half at\nEverton last month. They provide the\nbigger goal threat and will therefore\nbe favourites.\nPrediction: 1-2\nCrystal Palace v Arsenal\n(Saturday 12:45pm, BT Sport 1)\nPalace look down and out and\nonly some Ian Holloway magic can\nsave their season for me. Arsenal are\non a real roll, are outstanding away\nand should win comfortably. Expect\nMezut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey to be\non the scoresheet again.\nPrediction: 0-3\nBest of the rest\n(Saturday 3pm unless stated)\nAston Villa v Everton\nPaul Lambert has won more points\naway than at home and Villa do\nstruggle when teams sit back and they\ncannot counter. Everton won\u2019t sit back\nthough and with Lukaku \ufb01ring this\nshould be an entertaining contest.\nPrediction: 2-2\nLiverpool v West Brom\nThe Sturridge-Suarez partnership\nlooks excellent but couldn\u2019t see o\ufb00\nNewcastle last time out. The Baggies\nenjoyed their last visit to the NorthWest, beating Manchester United,\nand have the attacking potency to\ncause Liverpool problems too.\nPrediction: 1-1\nMan United v Stoke\nUnited dropped points again last\nweekend and serious questions are\nnow being asked of David Moyes. But\nStoke, having gone o\ufb00 the boil after a\n\ufb01ne start and don\u2019t have the strikers to\nin\ufb02ict another Old Tra\ufb00ord upset.\nPrediction: 2-0\nNorwich v Cardi\ufb00\nThe Canaries are in a false position\nbut face an easier run of games\nstarting this weekend. Sadly for\nCardi\ufb00 fans, the new owner\u2019s needless\ntinkering looks to have undermined\nsome promising early-season form.\nPrediction: 1-0\nSouthampton v Fulham\nThe Saints are on a remarkable\nrun and there\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t\nkeep going here against a Fulham\nside whose attackers simply aren\u2019t\ndelivering just now. This could be\ncurtains for Martin Jol.\nPrediction: 2-0\nSwansea v West Ham\n(Sunday 4pm)\nWest Ham pulled o\ufb00 some result\nin their last away game, beating\nTottenham 3-0, but folded against\nManchester City. Thumping\nSunderland, however, might just have\nkick-started Swansea\u2019s season.\nPrediction: 1-0\nTottenham v Hull\n(Sunday 4pm)\nHull are the season\u2019s surprise\npackage but defeats at Chelsea,\nManchester City and Everton suggest\nthey can\u2019t yet challenge top teams.\nSpurs should win here.\nPrediction: 1-0\nSynchronised\nSwimming is in!\nLast year was great and we are trying to achieve even more in the coming year! We had 29 members, more\nthan enough to put fantastic routines\ntogether!! Only a few months on and\nour members \u2013 beginners, intermediates and advanced \u2013 were presenting\ntheir routines at our Christmas show\nin the pool of St. Mary\u2019s hospital. This\nname is probably familiar to everyone\ngiven that the Royal Baby was born\nthere. That\u2019s also where our training\nsessions take place. So, if you join our\nteam, you will see the famous hospital.\nAdd a Harlington grant, some pretty\ngood RCC funding and a Sport Imperial sponsorship and you get some\ngreat new equipment, to make sure\nyou get \ufb01t and your muscles are toned,\nand an amazing professional coach, to\nget the best teaching ever, whatever\nyour level!\nLast May, six of our members, half\nof them beginners, competed in the\nFrench National University Championship; and just like the year before,\nare now happily wearing their bronze\nmedals. More than a competition, this\nwas an opportunity for a great weekend of Synchro and other activities all\ntogether in Bordeaux! We visited the\nFrench city, and discovered a vineyard\nas well as a Mexican Navy Boat. We\nalso spent a couple of days by the sea\nto do some open water training and\ntry fresh seafood. We don\u2019t know yet\nwhere the competition will take place\nthis year, but we\u2019ll be there and you\ncan be part of it!\nNot everyone wants to commit to\nthat much training. But everybody\nwill get the chance to present what\nhe or she has learned. Last summer\u2019s\nshow with the teams from Brighton\nand London Seymour was very suc-cessful, attracting over 60 visitors at\nEthos pool. All our members were\nable to show their skills and were astonished to see what Synchro elite and\nmaster swimmers can do; and The\nBrighton Dolphins convinced everyone that Synchro can still be enjoyed\nafter 50! Join us this year and you will\nbe a part of it. You will also be able\nto go to Brighton and swim with the\nBrighton Dolphins, enjoy a walk on\nthe beach, a nice, fresh portion of \ufb01sh\nand chips, and discover the very famous Brighton pubs!\nOf course Synchro is not just about\nswimming; it\u2019s also being part of a super friendly team, with swimmers of\nall nationalities, having a great time\nin various pubs and restaurants and\ntrying things you haven\u2019t tried before!\nYou won\u2019t be getting \ufb01t alone in your\ngym but having a lot of fun in the pool\nwith good music and nice people, and\nwe can promise you will get \ufb01tter than\nyou would have by watching a wall and\nrunning on a treadmill!!\nBut Synchro does not only help you\nto get in shape, joining the team is also\na way to boost your CV. Our committee is currently run by \ufb01nal year PhD\nstudents, so there will be three open\npositions very soon, if you want a fun\nway to learn essential life skills this is\nthe place to start!

    "content": "28 FRIDAY 25 OCT\nGAMES\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Calum Skene,\nImran Rashid\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nYong Wen Chua\nGames Writer\nThe new 3D graphics (when I say\n3D, I mean the 3D models you see in\ngames, not the stereoscopic 3D you\nget in a 3DS) would be the \ufb01rst thing\nthat someone would notice when they\npick up the game. For the \ufb01rst time in\nthe game\u2019s history (only considering\nthe main series of games and not their\nspin-o\ufb00s), Pok\u00e9mon are no longer just\n2D sprites with some extra frames for\nrudimentary animations \u2014 they are\nnow living, breathing creatures who\nmove around during battle scenes\nwhen you are idle. They squirm in\npain when they get hit, and they dance\nwhen they are happy.\nThe overworld is also now in\nglorious and beautiful 3D. Cities\nand towns actually feel alive with\npeople who move around and you\ncan eavesdrop on their conversations\nif you so wish. The camera swoops\narounds with di\ufb00erent camera angles\nas you move around the cities and\nroutes, highlighting the amazing\naesthetics that Game Freak has added\nto the cities. One of the caves only\nallows traversing with an over-the-shoulder look, giving it more of a\nmysterious nature without the usual\ntop-down approach. This was \ufb01rst\nfeatured in Pok\u00e9mon Black and White,\nbut with the game now moving onto\nbetter graphics with the 3DS, it looks\nway better. With the game set in the\nKalos region modelled after France, it\nis not surprising to \ufb01nd some French\nknocko\ufb00s in the game. There is a\ntower in the middle of the largest city\nthat is obviously a copy of the Ei\ufb00el\nTower, and there is also a clone of the\nVersaille Palace in the game.\nRandom encounters with Pok\u00e9mon\nin the game are also more varied.\nYou can now walk across grass \ufb01elds,\nshallow water, and even have Pok\u00e9mon\nleap out of bushes or the sand to\nambush you. In caves, Pok\u00e9mon can\neven swoop down from the ceiling\nto attack you. Some people may\nreally hate such random encounters\nprevalent in typical Japanese games;\nthe variety of such encounters seem\nto have alleviated the frustration, and\nI actually look forward to having some\nencounters.\nThe music in the game sounds really\namazing. I really liked the various\nbattle themes. The cities and towns\nhave music that seems to emphasise\nthe beauty aspects of them, and is\njust really pleasing to listen to. I\nusually have the volume slider on my\n3DS turned all the way up when I am\nplaying at home. I should also note\nthat the music sounds di\ufb00erent from\nprevious games, with a change in the\nstyle of the music.\nFor the \ufb01rst time in the series, the\nplayer is able to customise his or her\nappearance. You can buy clothes,\nand change your hairstyle and your\naccessories like your bag and hat. This\nis all done in the name of being stylish,\nwhich is also a gameplay mechanic\nthat allows you access to some of the\nlocations in the game.\nIn ages past, battles mostly looked\nlike two Pok\u00e9mon sprites moving\nlaterally on a screen, and blinking\nwhen they get hit. Well, not any\nmore. Battles feel very much alive\nin Pok\u00e9mon X and Y. While the\nplayer decides on his next move, the\nPok\u00e9mon on the \ufb01eld will breathe,\nidle around, and even turn around\nto look at the player for directions.\nWhen the attacks are exchanged, they\nwill actually move in a way that is\nconsistent with what the attack is. For\nexample, if it wants to shoot a Hyper\nBeam, it might actually open its mouth\nand shoot a beam. When Pok\u00e9mon get\nhit, they will squirm and grimace. Just\nlike in Pok\u00e9mon Black and White, the\ngame camera will also pan around the\nbattle\ufb01eld, giving you an immersive\nexperience while you battle.\nUnfortunately, it also seems that\nGame Freak might have gone a bit\ntoo far in terms of maximising and\nutilising the 3DS graphics capabilities\nin this game. Stereoscopic 3D is not\nalways used consistently in the game. It\nonly manifests in cut scenes, and only\nin single one on one battles. In battles,\nyou could literally see the framerate of\nthe game drop and lag when you have\nstereoscopic 3D turned on. Even with\nstereoscopic 3D turned o\ufb00, battles\nsometimes lag as well. This gets worse\nin a triple battle.\nThe stories of the Pok\u00e9mon games\nhave really never been a draw. They are\nthe same. Pok\u00e9mon Black and White\nand their sequels actually made a stark\nimprovement in terms of the storyline\nbeing slightly more interesting and\ndi\ufb00erent.\nThe story is typical. When you start\nthe game, the game asks if you are a\nboy, or a girl. You make your choice,\nenter your name and then you are\na thrown into your bedroom. You\nare a newbie in town who is given a\nPok\u00e9dex by some professor who then\nsends you o\ufb00 on a journey to complete\nit. You are called to investigate some\nmystery about mega-evolution\n(mechanics described below). At\nthe same time, you collect eight gym\nbadges to complete in the Pok\u00e9mon\nleague, and become the champion\nafter challenging the elite four. You\nalso encounter some evil organisation.\nThey are just called Team Flare in\nthis game. It is all the same. If you\u2019ve\nplayed any of the games, you\u2019ve heard\nof the story. It is actually a regression\ncompared to Pok\u00e9mon Black and\nWhite. It raises some interesting\nadult themes of overpopulation and\nresource scarcity, but they never really\nget developed.\nIn games past, you would usually\nhave one (and then two) rivals in the\ngame who aid you on your quest. This\ntime, you get four, three of whom are\nreally annoying. They get in the way,\nsay silly things, and just babble on and\non. I think Game Freak intended to\nmake the whole journey seem less of\na solo experience, but I don\u2019t think it\nworked for me. Perhaps that\u2019s because\nI am old and cynical.\nThe only one who is bearable and\neven slightly likeable is your actual\nrival who is the gender that you\ndid not choose when making your\ncharacter, but they su\ufb00er from really\nlow self esteem and say extremely self-deprecating things when you defeat\nthem. What am I supposed to do? I\ncan\u2019t progress if I don\u2019t defeat you,\nand yet you say such depressing things\nthat really make your character rather\nunlikeable, and di\ufb03cult to empathise\nwith.\nI\nn the 17 years since the \ufb01rst\nPok\u00e9mon games were released,\nGame Freak have been\nchurning out generations of\niterative games, each improving\nupon their predecessors gradually.\nNow in its sixth generation of the\ngames, Pok\u00e9mon X & Y delivers\nanother more-of-the-same but\ngreatly improved game from its\npredecessor Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and\nWhite 2. I played Pok\u00e9mon Y, but\nthe di\ufb00erences between the versions\nare slight, and do not involve any\ngameplay mechanics.

    "content": "8 FRIDAY 25 OCT\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBoris: Resolute Vertebrate Jelly Part I\nT\nhe mayor for London, Boris\nJohnson,madetheheadlines\nin February of this year after\ndeeming members of the\nLondon Assembly as \u201cgreat\nsupine protoplasmic invertebrate\njellies\u201d for failing to interrogate him\nover revisions to the \u00a316.5 bn budget.\nThe characteristic neologism merely\ncapped his voluminous arsenal of\nquips and redeeming facets. He is,\nby far, the most popular politician in\nThe Conservative Party at present.\nA March 2013 poll carried out\nby the London Evening Standard\nclaimed that he would obliterate\nEd Miliband in the polls if he were\nto (hypothetically) succeed David\nCameron as party leader. His broad\nand endearing appeal to the people of\nLondon is extensive, being re-elected\nwith a 44% mandate over Labour\u2019s\nKen Livingstone.\nIt has become increasingly apparent\nto me that Boris Johnson\u2019s political\nmachinations often proceed without\ninhibition. As an indi\ufb00erent freshman\nI voted him back into power in 2012,\npurely on a whim of popularity. This\ndawned on me eighteen months later\nwhen a friend commented with vitriol\nthat he simply,\n\u201cdoesn\u2019t get the phenomena that\nis Boris Johnson. Londoners blindly\ntolerate his mayorship despite him\nbeing a blatant right-wing arsehole.\u201d\nMy view of Boris Johnson isn\u2019t as\nextreme. In fact an ethereal veil of\nguilt envelops me when I criticise him\nat all. I want to examine the reasons\nfor his apparent immunity to criticism\nin context of his policies.\nBoris\u2019 \u20189- point plan for a Greater\nLondon\u2019 covered a lot of ground\nEoghan J. Totten\n@eoghantotten\nComment Editor\nfor a manifesto during the 2012\nelection campaign. Its appeal spanned\nall societal thresholds. Foreign\ninvestment bankers, migrant workers\nand local Londoners alike were able\nto empathise with its \ufb01scal rectitude.\nCuts to city hall in excess of \u00a33.5 bn\nsimultaneously implied that Boris\nJohnson intended to inhibit any\nunnecessary bureaucracy while\ndelivering more for Londoners. The\nability to demonstrate apt \ufb01nances for\nthelatterprovedpivotalinoverturning\nKen Livingstone of Labour. The\ncomplementary freezing of the\nMayoral share of council tax bolstered\nMr. Johnson\u2019s resolve. Crucially, the\n\u00a3445 return for the taxpayer may have\nprovided comfort to Londoners on the\nbottom rung of the income ladder.\nThe binary pledge of creating\n200,000 jobs by 2015 with a \u00a3221\nmillion investment in small business\nwasambitious.Itsuniversalappealwas\nagain apparent. This championing of\ncapitalism may have served to appease\nnot only the \ufb01nancially endowed but\nalso the jobless and working classes.\nIn an analogous fashion his support\nof strong policing, combined with a\npledge for green space restoration,\nencompassed two fulcrums in the\nlives of those who live in a city. Safety\nand health are chief priorities for all\ncitizens. By demonstrating that city\nhall\u2019s sympathies were congruent with\nthose priorities Boris Johnson made a\nsmart move. He managed to decouple\nhis integrity as a man from his\ncapitalist politics. It was of perennial\nimportance that Boris Johnson\ndistanced himself from Downing\nStreet. Ken Livingstone was always\nconveyed as thoroughly enmeshed\nwith his labour politics. This skew,\nalbeit slight, may have contributed to\nhis downfall at the polls.\nI conclude with a note on Boris\u2019\napproach to transport. His pledge to\nservice improvement on the tubes,\nexpansion of the \u2018Boris Bike\u2019 scheme,\nwhen underpinned by \ufb02edgling\nprojects such as Crossrail and\nunwavering support for an airport\non the Thames estuary, conveyed a\nsteadfast sense of resolve. To warp\nhis own words he is, undoubtedly,\na vertebrate. As I\u2019ll attempt to\ndemonstrate next week he\u2019ll need to\nbe dynamic and \ufb02uid as mayor in the\ncoming years. Rising rail fares, a \ufb02atpack Olympic legacy and the \u2018plebgate\u2019\ndebacle are clear evidence for this.\notten\nConfessions of a GTA: Part 3\nI\nwas really looking forward to my\nteachingclasswiththe\ufb01nalyears.\nAt last these were people that did\nnot care if you did not know the\nanswer of the top of your head as\nlong as you tell them what the heck is\ngoing on or at least what should be. I\nthink this is something to do with the\nFear. This is that feeling you get before\nyour exams that makes you start\nstudying ridiculously early and freak\nout went you \ufb01nd out one of your\nclassmates is studying for 12 hours\na day. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the \ufb01rst\nyears are lovely but the Fear \ufb01lls them.\nI think this causes irritating questions\nlike \u201cIs it ok if I use a blue pen in the\nexam?\u201d Or worrying questions such\nas \u201cHow do you add up in Excel?\u201d and\nalso the crazy questions. My favourite\nof these was one fresher marching up\nto a lecturer, who is eminent in his\n\ufb01eld, and insisted that a question on\nthe tutorial sheet was wrong because\nhe had done three pages of working\nand the solution he had found was\nimpossible\u2026\nThe \ufb01nal years do not have the Fear.\nThey are either too exhausted or too\nbeaten down to care. These are the\npeople who will, on hearing an MSc\nstudent complaining they\u2019d been in\nthe computer room for two days and\ntheir social life was ruined, yell across\nthe room \u201cWelcome to Imperial\u201d, or\nwhen \ufb01nding out that they are getting\nanother lab on top of six courseworks\nand an essay will just laugh.\nHowever, this all changed when I\nhad a look at their practical sheet. All\nI could think was \u201cthis is really hard!!!\n\u201cIt was not like this four months ago\nwhen I was there. The Fear did hit\nme then, sadly for the \ufb01rst time in\nyears. How was I going to walk into\na room and not be able to explain the\nquestion? It was bad\u2026\nI walk into the lecture theatre and\nmarch towards the lecturer only to\nget sidetracked, but I could answer\nthis question. Relief \ufb01lls me when all\nI have to do is explain the method. I\nhappily do this for the next half hour.\nOnly to \ufb01nd then that all the students\n\u201cSometimes the solutions are not the problem\u201d\nD\nichotomy is the act of\nseparating anything\ninto two separate\ncomponents, A and B. A\ngreat asset of this is to\nkeep things simple, easy to manage,\nand reduce variables to a minimum.\nAn example of this is \u201cyou\u2019re either\nwith me, or you\u2019re against me\u201d.\nThis dichotomy seems fairly\nstraightforward(ifalittleintimidating).\nThis statement intimidates and\ncoerces up until the point that we\nrealise that the dichotomy is in fact,\nfalse. The position of neutral ground\nis a perfectly logical one, which the\nstatement avoids in order to carry\nthrough its e\ufb00ect.\nThe use of false dichotomy is one\nthat seems to constantly crop up in\ndaily life, yet it is very infrequently\nnoticed, forgotten as people make an\nexclusive decision and move on.\nMany a time has a great opportunity\nbeen stymied by the inability of the\ndecision makers to agree on a course\nDaniel Adams on the joy of dichotomy\nThe GTA\nAnonymous\ntimes the\nhad got the same answer that I had\nfound previously, but was wrong. How\nwas this happening? I look around\ndesperately for the lecturer who slinks\nout of the door to leave me alone with\na class full of vaguely irritated and\ntired students. So, forced into a corner\nI committed the number one GTA sin\nof showing the students the answer.\n(Yes I know\u2026)\nHalf way through a complex and\nwildly imagined theory of how you\ncould do it, the lecturer saunters up\nto tell me the question is wrong\u2026 So\nmaybe that\u2019s the key of GTAing. The\nFear is gone but perhaps we need the\ncraziness of the \ufb01rst years to stand up\nand say that they think it is wrong,\neven to the cleverest people we know.\nof action because their personal\npreferences seemed mutually\nexclusive. Great nights out stalled,\ndeals failed, relationships broken,\nor never even begun when often\nthe perceived dichotomy was totally\nbogus.\nMany false dichotomies seem to\n\ufb01nd their roots in people\u2019s own beliefs\nand assumptions. Usually they are\nexacerbated when said people don\u2019t\nquestion their beliefs critically and on\na regular basis.\nTo take another example: \u201cA student\nmust choose two of theses option at\nImperial: social life, good grades, or\nsleep\u201d. Daniel chose sleep.\nBORISWATCH.COM\n\u201cThere are two types\nof people in this\nworld.\nThose who\ndichotomise\u2026\nAnd those who don\u2019t\u201d\n\u201c...he is, undoubtedly,\na vertebrate.\u201d\n\u201c...an ethereal veil\nof guilt envelops me\nwhen I criticise him at\nall.\u201d\n\n"

One new\nshow that \ufb01ts the bill is Sleepy Hollow,\none of the US\u2019s new autumn shows, the\n\ufb01rst episode of which was shown last\nweek on Universal. Whilst the show\nisn\u2019t directly related to the \ufb01lm of the\nsame name featuring Johnny Depp,\nboth are based o\ufb00 the folktale written\nby American author Washington\nIrving, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\nwhich narrates the story of the ill-fated\nIchabod Crane and his encounter with\nthe Headless Horseman.\nThe story has been adapted and\nreinterpreted many times, but the\nlatest version, created by two of the\nwriters of the rebooted Star Trek \ufb01lms\nbreathes fresh life into the tale by\ntransporting it to modern times and\nadding a biblical twist. Here, Ichabod\nCrane, a soldier in the American\nRevolutionary War and acquaintance\nof a pre-presidential General\nGeorge Washington, is killed after\ndecapitating the Headless Horseman.\nPlaced under a spell, he reawakens in\nthe present day, to \ufb01nd the Horseman\nreturned and chopping o\ufb00 heads left\nright and centre. If that\u2019s not bad\nenough, it turns out the Horseman\nis only one of the Four Horsemen,\nharbingers of the Apocalypse.\nIchabod is discovered by Lieutenant\nAbbie Mills, a police o\ufb03cer whose\nmentor, the Sheri\ufb00 of the town,\nis one of the \ufb01rst victims of the\nHorseman. Although skeptical at\n\ufb01rst of Ichabod\u2019s explanation of time-travel and witchcraft, Abbie has some\nof her own previous experiences with\nunexplained phenomena, and the two\nteam up to investigate.\nIt\u2019s early days yet for the show, but\nthe \ufb01rst episode puts it o\ufb00 to\na promising start. One of the\nhighlights so far is Ichabod\u2019s attempts\nto familiarise himself with the\ndi\ufb00erences between 1781 and the\npresent; such as electric car windows\nand the ubiquity of Starbucks. And\nalthough his and Abbie\u2019s relationship\ngets o\ufb00 to a somewhat rocky start\nwhen he politely inquires as to\nwhether she\u2019s been emancipated\n(Abbie being African-American), the\npair make a good couple, with Abbie\u2019s\nno-nonsense attitude balancing out\nIchabod\u2019s earnest naivety. There\u2019s also\na refreshing lack of sexual tension\nbetween the two, in spite of the best\nattempts of Ichabod\u2019s hair, which\nhandsomely blows around his face,\nwind-tunnel like, in every scene.\nWith a second series already\ncommissioned in the US, may be worth\ngetting into.At the very least, the choice\nof song for the end of the pilot episode\n- appropriately, Johnny Cash\u2019s The Man\nComes Around - proves the show has\ngood taste. Here\u2019s hoping that there\u2019s\neven better yet to come.\nSleepy Hollow is currently airing on\nthe Universal Channel.\nFive suggestions for TV-themed Halloween Costumes\nThe days of cutting eye holes in a bedsheet are long gone, we\u2019re afraid: you\u2019re nobody unless you\u2019re wearing a culturally signi\ufb01cant, ironically cool get-up that\u2019s been weeks in the making. No need to panic,\nthough, we\u2019ve got you covered: here\u2019s \ufb01ve suggestions that require little e\ufb00ort, yet will get you your pick of the fun-size Mars bars.\nDaenerys Targaryon\n(Game of Thrones)\nStick on a blonde wig and smudge\ndirt on your face. Don\u2019t worry if you\ndon\u2019t have dragons to complete the\ncostume; it\u2019ll add to the authenticity\nwhen you knock on your neighbours\u2019\ndoor screaming, \u201cWhere are my\ndragons??\u201d\nTobias F\u00fcnke (Arrested\nDevelopment)\nWho better to go as than the world\u2019s\n\ufb01rst \u2018Analrapist\u2019?

Just don\u2019t\nforget the denim cut-o\ufb00s or you get\nmight get a bit chilly (and scare any\nchildren).\nRuby Tandoh\n(Great British Bake Off)\nJust add an over-sized cardie, denim\njacket, and an air of self-deprecating\nanxiety. If anyone compliments you on\nyour costume, shrug your shoulders\nand tell them you thought it\u2019d come\nout a bit shit, to be honest.\nAnyone from Made in\nChelsea\nPull on your \ufb01nest red Jack Wills\ntrousers, get yourself a goatee, slap\non the fake tan, and you\u2019re good to\ngo. Now go back upstairs and get\nchanged; even Halloween isn\u2019t worth\nlooking like that much of a tosser.\nWalter White\n(Breaking Bad)\nYou\u2019ll never look as good as this baby,\nbut that\u2019s not to stop you from trying.\nEveryone\u2019s favourite meth dealer\nis easy enough to impersonate: key\ncomponents are a bad ass hat and\nmenacing stare (the meth is optional).\nEmily Fulham offers some novel dress-up ideas this year\n\n"

Well it got us\nthinking about not only of how much\nof a pair of eavesdroppers we are, but\nhow casually we blame our \u2018genes\u2019\nfor pretty much any undesirable\ncharacteristics we have. But can we\nreally blame everything about us on\nour parents?\nSleep deprivation is a common\nproblem in many young people. But do\nwe inherit that from our parents too?\nIn fact there are proven hypotheses\nthatstate\u2018oursleeppatternisregulated\nby genetics\u2019.

Recent studies\nshow that there are \ufb01ve other factors\nthat prevent a sound sleep.\nNoise\nWhen living in London noise is\ninevitable. Either it is a speeding\nLamborghini in South Ken or the\nobnoxious screams of drunken\nstudents late at night \u2014 all these are\npart of the London life package. These\n\u2018little\u2019 disruptions are one of the prime\ncauses that prevent a good night\u2019s\nsleep. In the \ufb01rst stage of sleep, our\nbody and mind are relaxed. This is a\nstate between being awake and asleep.\nIn this state, a part of the brain called\nthe thalamus prevents information\n\ufb02ow from our senses to the rest of the\nbrain. However, this system can\u2019t \ufb01lter\nout noises.\nPossible Solution: try to block out\nthe noise as best as you can by keeping\ndoors and windows closed. If this\ndoesn\u2019t remove all the noise, then\nplug your headphones in and hear the\nsound of waves or rain. This will do\nwonders (speaking from experience)!\nLight and Dark\nIt is part of human nature to sleep\nwhen it is dark and to stay awake when\nit is light. Light exposure stimulates\na nerve pathway from the retina to\nthe brain, keeping your brain active.\nSo it is advisable to stop pulling o\ufb00\nso many all nighters as you\u2019ll end up\naltering your body clock, which will\nmake it harder for you to fall asleep at\nappropriate times.\nPossible Solution: good time\nmanagement is key to a good night\u2019s\nsleep: if you have un\ufb01nished work it\u2019s\nbetter to wake up early to complete it\nrather than spending all night working\nstrenuously.\nDiet\nCa\ufb00eine: when we are tired, it\u2019s very\neasy for us to give in to a cup of co\ufb00ee\nor a can of red bull to stay awake.\nBut the e\ufb00ects of ca\ufb00eine from these\nproducts can last in our system for\nhours, hence not letting us sleep. In\naddition, ca\ufb00eine only promotes the\nlight sleep and prevents the deep sleep\nstage.\nAlcohol: after a night out and a peg\nor two we feel very drowsy and people\nmay say that alcohol helps them\nfall asleep. But too much alcohol\nconsumption prevents the \ufb01rst\nstage of sleep from occurring, which\ndisrupts the overall sleep cycle; and\ntherefore it leaves us feeling tired in\nthe morning. You may not know, but\nalcohol causes many people to snore,\nwhich makes it di\ufb03cult to breath and\nthereby prevents comfortable sleep.\nFood: a heavy meal at dinner is\nanother factor that prevents us\nfrom sleeping well. Several types\nof food such as spicy food, bacon,\ncheese all contain a chemical known\nas tyramine, which causes the\nrelease of a neurotransmitter called\nnoradrenaline. This neurotransmitter\nregulates our \u2018\ufb01ght-or-\ufb02ight\u2019 response\nby keeping our body active.\nPossible Solution: try to avoid\nca\ufb00eine and alcohol especially at\nnight as much as possible. You\ncould replace a cup of co\ufb00ee with\na warm glass of milk instead. Aim\nSWEET BRIAR VOICE\nfor a light and carbohydrate rich\ndinner. Carbohydrates release the\nneurotransmitter serotonin, which\nmakes us feel drowsy.\nBody temperature\nComing home from a cold rainy\nday (typical London weather!), we\nmay think that a warm bedroom is\nthe perfect solution. But when we\nsleep our core body temperature\nfalls; however a warm room makes\nit di\ufb03cult for this process to happen.\nThis makes you feel uncomfortable\nand leaves you battling for sleep.\nPossible Solution: Keep your bedroom\nwell ventilated and avoid turning on\nthe radiator too much, which will not\nonly save your bills, but also help you\nto sleep better!\nA busy mind\nBalancing a social and an academic\nlife is a nightmare for any university\nstudent. Being Imperial students, we\nknow exactly how busy our minds\nalways are. Did you know that a busy\nmind is sleep\u2019s worst enemy? An\noveractive and anxious mind prevents\nthe body from entering the relaxed\nstate required to fall asleep.\nPossible Solution: Try doing a puzzle\nlike Sudoku, hangman or crossword\nto distract your mind from other\nthoughts and then try falling asleep.\nWarm baths and showers have also\nbeen proven to relax the mind.\nDon\u2019t underestimate the importance\nof sleep. Sleep helps us form\nmemories, and assists us with speech\nand reasoning as well as regulates our\nmood. So next time you\u2019re struggling\nto sleep, it may be your own fault and\nnot that of your parents\u2019!\nEverybody knows that sleeping on a book allows knowledge to enter your brain by osmosis, guaranteeing exam success\nA\nfter hundreds of years of\nhypothesis, the primary\nfunction for sleep\nmay now have been\ndiscovered. Maiken\nNedergaard and colleagues this week\nreleased a paper detailing how in sleep\nthe brain clears away waste proteins\nlinked to neurodegenerative diseases\nsuch as Alzheimer\u2019s that build up in\nthe space between brain cells.\nThe recently discovered network of\ntiny pathways within the brain that\nallow these proteins to be cleared is\ncalled the glymphatic system, similar\nto the lymphatic system in the body\nthat \ufb02ushes toxic by-products out\nof the blood and into the liver. The\npathways circulate cerebrospinal \ufb02uid\n(CSF) into the spaces between cells in\nthe brain, removing the toxic proteins.\nIt had been noted before that the\nlevel of these proteins is higher in\nawake animals than in sleeping ones,\nbut that was previously thought to\nbe because they were produced at a\nhigher rate when the brain is awake.\nThis team investigated the alternate\npossibility that the glymphatic system\nis more active when animals are\nsleeping.\nThey worked with anaesthetised,\nawake and sleeping mice, whose CSF\nwas injected with green dye when their\nbrain waves indicated that they were\nasleep, and red dye when awake. The\npath of the dyes through the brain was\nthen followed, and it was found that\nlarge amounts of CSF were taken into\nthe brain when the mice were asleep,\nbut not when awake. Indeed, when the\nmice were woken, the in\ufb02ux of CSF\ndropped by approximately 95%.\nThey also tested the clearing of\ninjected proteins, and found they\ncleared twice as quickly when the\nmice were asleep. Both of these e\ufb00ects\nseem to be due to the channels that\ncarry the \ufb02uid expanding by 60% in\nTo sleep, perchance to clean (your brain)\nasleep and anesthetised mice.\nIt still remains to be seen whether\nthe build-up of these toxic proteins\nactually regulate sleep \u2014 whether\nthey make you more drowsy the more\nof them there are \u2014 but this paper\ndoes appear to reveal, at last, one very\nimportant function of sleep.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1241224\nEmma Wills\nScience Writer\nGet involved:\nscience.felix@imperial.\nac.uk\n\n"
