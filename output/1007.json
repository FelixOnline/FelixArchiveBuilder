Who's the film advertises.\u00a9\nkul tur und gei st The musical component of the South Bank Centre's 'German\nRomanticism' festival began with a program of Beethoven, Wagner and\nHenze played by the London Philharmonic under Franz WelsenMost.\nBeethoven's5 th Symphony (1808) was a ground-breaking work in\nRomanticism, performed here with terseness and precision.\nWagner's Wesendonk Lieder (1858) were composed in the same\nperiod as Tristan und Isolde and their music reminds us of the terrific\nemotional and sensual force of that opera; another key work in the\nhistory of Romanticism. But Wagner was also one of those who killed\nRomanticism in the dark, morally corrupt events of The Ring of the\nNibelung. Thus the lyrical, heroic, pure spirit of Romanticism was stifled.\nAlthough its influence has survived in Germany and many 20th century\ncomposers have acknowledged an inspiration in the Romantic music of\nthe 1 9th century, including Henze himself. A fact which may surprise the\nlistener, since Germany has been particularly associated with the most\nextreme varieties of atonal, seria list composition.\nHenze's Heliogabalus Imperator (1972) is a solid, well-written piece\ntypical of its period. It was a challenge to the audience to find the\nconnections between its sound world and that of Beethoven'sI don't think I managed that. Still it is good that the festival planners were not\nafraid to mix old and new like this; they could easily have chosen to keep\nthe crowds happy with a serving of solid 19th century repertoire.\nThe visual delight of the Deutsche Romantik festival is at the\nHayward Gallery, which is showing over 300 works of art embodying the\nromantic, themes. Romanticism can be seen as the artist's expression of\nthe highest values, the search for the spiritual ideals within naturalness\nand nature. It is a contemplation of that which celebrates God and the\npinnacles of human achievement. Artists of this tradition saw themselves\nas loners, individual anti-heroes who would struggle against the frailties\nof mankind in their attempt to portray the purest of ideas and emotions\nwithin natural forms. The early paintings are typically representational\nwith many landscapes, seascapes and sky s capes. Friedrich provides\ntypical examples of these, his s capes often viewed by contemplative\nfigures. Allegorical themes abound, with gods and daemons dancing over\nsleeping maidens. The leering, skull bone face of Death lurks in many of\nthese works, gloating over the inevitability of the artist's end. Around the\nturn of the century the shift is quite disconcerting, descending a floor in\nthe gallery to find that representation has suddenly been abandoned. This\npart of the exhibition takes you on a whirlwind tour through modernism,\nexpressionism and abstraction, with a stark climax at the end in Joseph\nBeuys' huge assortment of concrete blocks, appropriately titled 'The end of\nthe twentieth century'.\nThe most extreme expression of the Romantic ideals came with\nNazism, and a few paintings from this time are shown, although some\nhave argued that a more extensive portrayal of Hitler's time was\nnecessary, as he was perhaps the greatest of all Romantic idealists.\nDespite this, the exhibition provides an unparalleled insight into this area\nof German Art, and for those who are prepared to slog th rou u \u2022 a, ii ri.j iv \u2022 i: dl'- \u2022\u2022- :,u;:':r.:.,. \u2022;\n.\n\u2022 ii p..i The festival continues until 24th November at the South Bank Centre,\ntel; 0171 928 8800.\nI40CT94 FELIX HI "

    "content": "> Computers feature\nFUN!'\nYes, I was broke over the summer and needed to top up my\ngrant for next year. No, I wasn't working in Tescos or fruit-picking in France. I worked for a computer firm over the\nsummer. So what, you may ask. This, however, was a serious\nchallenge. I was fortunate enough to take part in the Shell\nlech o ology and Enterprise Programme, known as STEP for\nshort. This programme offers second year and penultimate year\nundergraduates the opportunity to work on eight-week projects\nfor small and medium sized companies.\nI was placed with a small electronics company called\nSemiconductor Supplies International Ltd, which supplies\nindustry and private buyers with electrical and electronic\ncomponents, such as diodes and speakers. Its computer sales\ndepartment was established in October 1993.\nThe company had a serious problem in that customers\nbuying computer components wanted these assembled for them.\nBecause no full-time employee had enough time to learn the\nassembly process, this is where 1 came in. The aim of my project\nwas \"To build computer systems to customer requirements and\nto write a technical manual on the assembly process\".\nDuring my placement I had to teach myself how to build\ncomputer systems from the company's components and built, a large number of systems for customers. As I was for the most\npart unsupervised I continuously needed to show a lot of\ninitiative- and clear thinking. By the end of my placement I could\nbuild a system in under 30 minutes, quite an achievement\nconsidering that the first system took me one and a half days.\nI also had to write a technical manual on the assembly\nprocess. Ibis was distributed to customers who needed to build\ntheir own computers at home and also to companies who\nwanted to train employees in system assembly. Eventually I produced the first fully comprehensive technical manual on\ncomputer assembly. It, is protected by copyright laws and has\nbeen published by the company. I also tested all the computer\ncomponents in stock and tutored customers in system assembly.\nAll students on the STEP scheme who completed the full\neight, weeks had to write an account of their experience. This\nreport was presented to a panel of judges and the winner was\npresented with the Most Enterprising Student award. This was\norganised by the local sponsoring company, which in my case\nwas SIRA Test, and Certification Ltd (who paid half of my\nsalary).\nEach of the 14 students at the local final gave a fascinating presentation of their placement. To my great\nsurprise I managed to win (don't ask me how), picked up my\ncash prize and qualified for the South East and London\nRegional Final. This I also managed to win\n(no, I'm not. as pod)!I went on to represent,\nthe South East Region in the National Final.\nThis was an excellent experience: the 14\nfinalists, representing Scotland, Wales, North\nEngland etc., stayed in a top London hotel\nand 200 people attended the award ceremony,\nincluding many company chairpersons (a good\ntime for job contacts). This I did not win,\nyou'll be relieved to know. The competition\nwas very intense, with the winning student\nhaving saved his balloon company an\nestimated \u00a31 million a year.\nDespite not winning the national\ncompetition, my placement was extremely\nsuccessful. Computer sales and stock increased\nby 100% --- not bad for a summer's work. In\naddition, the company offered to employ me\nfor the rest, of my summer holidays, as well as\nin the future.\nHow did I benefit? Well, I developed\nmany skills needed in industry, notably the\nabilities to think clearly and quickly, show\ninitiative, take on responsibility, communicate\neffectively and solve problems efficiently. Many\nof these skills are not developed from academic studies, but\nfrom taking positions of responsibility within clubs and societies\nwhere you can get a feel for organising and co-ordinating.\nI would highly recommend STEP to all second year and\npenultimate year undergraduates. This year 1025 students took\npart, and there will probably be more places next year, so the\nactual odds of getting onto the scheme are higher than with\nother summer jobs. This is a great chance to get some real work\nexperience under your belt, a good reference and a CV with a bit\nof oo mph! Don't miss it.\nForfurther information, contact Faisal Haque (Elec.

O american myths awake\nGrant Lee Buffalo are either a Californian trio with rare integrity or yet\nanother bunch of Americans who are over-hyped and over here. Listen to\ntheir new album, 'Mighty Joe Moon', and you should be nodding in the\nformer direction, but only just.\nAfter using no less than twenty instruments things were never going\nto be easy and yet they manage to fuse blues, folk, country and rock\ninfluences into something gentle but exciting. The laid back guitar groove\nof opener 'Lone Star Song' leads into the undulating, cello-embellished\nstrains of 'Mockingbirds', and sees Grant Lee Phillips trading his baritone\ncroon for a falsetto. Elsewhere, 'Lady Godiva and Me' features a mid-section guitar riff that uncannily sounds like it belongs on a Cult album\n(honest) while Phillips could be Eddie Vedder on 'Happiness', not least\nwith his lament of \"happiness, it's hard to come by...\"\nDespite the general morose feel, however, the Buffalo have once\nagain managed to distil the best idiosyncratic American elements to\ncreate something that is, well, heart-warming. (7)\nI With her last album 'Exile from Guyville', Liz Phair broke ranks to\nbecome a feminine icon. Oh yeah. Anyone who believe that needs to\ngrow up and stop trying to grid axes with their genitalia. It's a dangerous\ngame they might 'bob bit t' themselves. Just because Liz sings about f****g a lot, it doesn't mean she's into role reversal. Actually she appears to\nquite like men and to that extent her new album, 'Whip-Smart' is no\ndifferent to 'Exile'. Yeah she swears a lot - (as the accompanying press\nrelease suggests,'\"93% of music reviewers will quote the line...\" which I won't quote as it is just a form of obscene hype) - but it's all a form of\ndevotion from a mixed up girl with a long chain of events behind her.\nMore importantly in between all the cussing she actually tells us why\nshe loves her man, what she'll do with her son when he grows up, the\nstrains of domestic li(o) ves and more. In 'nashville' when she refrains, \"\nI won't decorate my love\", we get to hear the root of her music. The point\nis that it's not nasty so much as merely heart felt.\nWhen Liz Phair tells you to 'watch your language' you'll know that it's because you're lying, not because you're necessarily being offensive.

I'd like to know what roused the man who\nput the 'lack' in slacker because tonight at Brixton Academy, he looked\nlike he was enjoying himself. Dinosaur Jr: grunge? sloth rock? Try full-force, power metal trio. I should have known, what with Ozzy Osbourne\nplaying on the speakers beforehand and Ted Nugent afterwards, but I'd never seen the man strangling this many beautifully obscene sounds out\nof a guitar before, at least not with a smile on his face. Maybe it was the\nsmug satisfaction of fooling everyone by throwing in that 1988 gem\n'Freak Scene' right at the start. Maybe it was bassist Mike Johnson, who\nadded the humour element to proceedings by looking like an extra from\nThe Addams Family. Or maybe Mascis was just revelling in shocking\neveryone with the band's brutal and un-vinyl like heav ios it y. Whatever it\nwas, it was worth it because we got two (yes, count 'em - two!) encores\nending in a five-minute thrash y workout. Joy of joys. I'm still in shock. \u00a9\nMM FELIX I40CT94\n\n"

Why not, was\nmy thought this time last year as I contemplated joining the Imperial\nCollege Underwater Club\n(I.C.U. C.). To be truthful, the\nthought of going underwater for\nany period of time longer than 30\nseconds did bring me out into a cold sweat. So why did I join\nI.C.U. C? Because I had seen photographs of people diving in exotic\nlocations all over the world, and I wanted to do the same. Also it is\nrelatively cheap to learn at college.\nGood enough reasons, so in I plunged in - literally.\nThe course consisted of a lecture every week and a practical\nlesson in the pool every two weeks\n(sometimes, if lucky, every week)\nfor the first two terms. The lectures covered diving safety, equip-ment, use of decompression\ntables, and different types of diving (night diving, wreck diving,\ndrift diving). The pool sessions\nbegin with snorkelling. It wasn't long before we were using an\naqualung, which to my pleasant\nsurprise worked \u2014 yes, you can\nbreathe underwater.\nFinally, after all the lectures\nand pool sessions, you're ready for\nyour first open water dive. By this\ntime you're feeling confident and\nyou just can't wait to get in the\nwater. And what an experience it\nis. Especially when you see your\nfirst, wreck.\nThis year I went on weekend\ndive trips to Swanage/Weymouth,\nLiltlehampton, Cover (Wales) and\nPlymouth. Each dive trip consisted of leaving as early as possible\non Friday and returning late\nSunday evening. Diving takes\nplace all day Saturday and all day\nSunday. Everyone usually has two\ndives on both days. The first dive,\nprobably being a wreck dive and\nthe second a scenic dive. The\nevenings consist of food, beer,\nmore beer, and if you really want,\nmore beer.\nSo, if you have any inclination to dive, don't hesitate, come\nalong and give it a try. I can guarantee you will have no regrets.\nThe training programme\nstarts Tuesday, IHlh October,\n6.30pm in W2/W3just inside Beit\nArch. Ifyou bring your swimming\ngear, you can li y aqualung that\nevening (fi-e ef).

    "content": "News Feature\nConfidential Drift\nThe Union may be going south, as MichaelLudlam explains below...\nA plan has been proposed by College to move\nthe Union to Sheffield to make way for a conference centre in Beit Quad. The scheme,\nonly officially admitted in July, is still in the\nearly stages of development. These proposals\narc par i of the 'Foster master plan1 that was\nconceived by architects to make the Queen's lower and lawn the \"heart-space\" of College.\nThis ties in with the suggested \"Albertopolis\"\nplan to convert the whole of South\nKensington using money from the millennium\nfund back to its former splendour. The Foster\narchitects carried out a review of the Sherfield\nbuilding which the Director of College\nEstates, Ian Caldwell described as a working\nenvironment that is \"tired, worn and\noutdated\". He added \"every time we get one\nnew member of staff in we spend an absolute\nfortune trying to sort out where to put them.\"\nIn particular the double corridors and light\nwells have been sighted as incredible wastes\nof space.\nThe College is already due for changes\nsoon. Plans for the Basic Medical School\n(BMS) that, is proposed to replace the old\nChemistry building have already been\nsubmitted to the Department of Health . This\nwill be in place to help the merger with the\nNational Heart and Lung Institute (NHLI)\nand Charing Cross Westminster Medical\nschool with Imperial College. It is also\nproposed that the Biology department move\nto the BMS. Thus if the Union was to relocate\nto Sherfield, Beit Quad would be free to\nbecome an accommodation block for\nconferences. As Beit is the most picturesque\npart of College this would probably re vital is e the conference attendance. Discussions have\nopened between ICU and College, but. no\ndecisions have been made. But this is not the\nonly proposal. ICU suggested that, the Quad\nbe developed to create what Dan Look,\ndeputy President of finances and services\ndescribed as a \"student village\" that would\ncontain the health centre, a dentist and lots of\nshops along with other student needs. But\n\"College weren't overly impressed by that,\"\nsaid Dan.\nChanges need to be made to the\nCollege to cope with the expected influx of an\nextra two thousand students in the next: seven\nyears. The tennis courts next to Linstead Hall\nare expected to go while floors will be added\nto the Sports Centre to cushion the loss. A lot,\nof the north side of Princes Gardens is\ncondemned or requires serious work while\nthere are plans to expand Southside. The\nCollege is going to have change its shape or it.\nwill run out of space.\nThe proposals to alter Sheffield are\n\"very serious\" and it is likely that changes\nwill go ahead. The Director of Estates Ian\nCaldwell, said that the administration side of\nCollege could probably be reduced. It\npresently occupies parts of all five floors. This\nwould free up space that could be used by\nother parts of the College. \"One of these\noptions is to create more student activities\nakin to the union\" said Ian Caldwell.\nThe Union itself is not. directly under\nthreat and College has recognised its role\nwithin Imperial. Students have been\npromised their voice will be heard. Dan Look\nsaid that, \"if they [College] want to move us\nwe would take this to a referendum for all the\nstudents in College\" adding that is the answer\nwas a no to moving, the Union would fight it\nali the way. \"It is students in the end who\ndecide.\"\nConcerns about any move to Sherfield\nby the Union have been voiced, in particular\nwith regard to the Union bar and the Union\nDining Hall. If such a move were to take\nplace FELIX has been reassured that they\nwould both be moved \"panel by panel\" to\nany new Union to preserve them. \"There is a lot of history to this building\" stated the ICU\nPresident Lucy Chothia. \"The problem is that\nthe Union has so much tradition [...] and\nSherfield is very faceless,\" added Dan Look\nwho continued \"let's face it, it's an ugly\nmonstrosity\".\nIf the Union were to move to Sherfield\nit would be contained in one floor that, would\nbe altered to provide at least all the services it\nnow provides and hopefully more. The Union\nneeds a larger venue to be able attract big\nbands, at present the biggest room in Beit\nonly holds 300. A purpose built venue and\nbars would theoretically provide a better\nservice for students but problems have been\ncited such as the bar deliveries and the noise\nfrom the bands disturbing the administration\ndepartment, as witnessed at last years rag\nfe te.A partial move so that some of the Union\nwould remain behind in Beit, has been\nsuggested but this has as many disadvantages\nas advantages. Any move to be considered\nwould be extremely expensive and would be\nmet by the College and not by the Union.\nThe Deputy President was adamant about\nthis particular issue slating \"the Union will\nnot pay for a single penny of moving us over\n[...] we are not going to pay to keep the\nfacilities we've got\".\nDan Look expressed reservations on\nhow the Union had not been approached\nbefore architects came to conduct a feasibility\nstudy. He said \"I think there is a tendency\namongst some members of College\nadministration not to realise the fact that\nImperial College is here for students. Without\nthe students it would no be a university, it. is\nas simple as that.\" While Lucy Chothia said\nthat College may have wanted to sec how\nquickly the new sabbaticals got off the mark\nand how much they wanted to be involved in\nthe discussions. For their hard work they\nhave had the assurances of the managing\ndirector of College, the Registrar, the Director\nof Estates and other influential figures within\nCollege that the Union will be fully consulted\nbefore anything goes ahead.\nGiven the time frame it is obvious that\nnothing physical will happen for a long time.\nHowever these are serious plans that require\nserious thought. The Union isn't completely\nopposed to these plans if they provide\nstudents better services. Dan Look happily\nadmitted, \"I agree with the principals of it, it.\nwould be nice to have a College campus with\none centre with everything gradually\nradiating out.\"\nWhat ever happens watch this space,\nor that space, or watch for the bulldozers. 1\n3\nBUM FELIX I40CT94\n\n"

What is\ndescribed as an \"affiliated relationship\" between the two establishments is planned to start this\nautumn. The amalgamation is the\nfirst phase of a plan to make\nImperial College a medical super-school.\nIn the second phase, if is\nexpected that, St. Mary's will\nmerge with Charing Cross\nWestminster Medical School and\nthe Royal Postgraduate Medical\nSchool to create one large medical\nschool at Imperial College. This\nsecond phase is due to start, is\n1996. The Basic Medical School,\nto be built on the site, of the old\nChemistry building, will hopefully\nabsorb some these facilities onto\none site. Joint admission by the\ntwo undergraduate medical\nschools to the South Kensington\ncampus is expected to start, in\n1997 or 1998. A merger with the\nInstitute for Cancer Research is\nalso being discussed although this\nwill be more difficult, as the\nInstitute receives much of its\nmoney from charity.\nImplant: Imperial acquires a new organ\nThere are seen to be four\nadvantages wi dia merger. Firstly\na larger school would be able to\nattract, bigger grants and carry out\nbetter research than the smaller\ninstitutions could themselves.\nSecondly that the education of\nPostgraduates, but, particularly\nUndergraduates will be improved.\nThe current intake for St. Mary's is small for future London medical\nschools, increasing the numbers\nword d hopefully help it survive\ninto the next, century. Imperial\nCollege will also play a part in\nhelping to prepare doctors for the\nexpanding field of medical tech-no logy. Thirdly administrative\ncosts will be reduced and lastly\nthat patient care will be improved.\nSome rational is ation is\nexpected so that the most can be\ngained from this merger. It, is seen\nas necessary to make the, new\nmedical school as attractive as\npossible, in the light, of present\ngovernment policy that is threatening some London teaching hospitals with closure. The medical\nschool that these proposals would\ncreate would be of \"world size and\nworld quality, something to which\nnone of the individual components\ncould separately aspire.\"\nAt, present it is unclear how\nexactly the plans will pan out, but\nit is clear that Imperial College is\nextremely serious about expanding its medical capabilities.\nH Contents \u2022 news pages one&two&three \u2022\neditorial and credits page three \u2022 news\nfeature: confidential drift page four \u2022 the\ns files: net special page seven \u2022 fresher s' week photo extravaganza pages eight&nine \u2022\nfeature: computing at shell page eleven \u2022 the\nfelix pull out and stick up on your wall\nspectacular pages twelve&thirteen \u2022 union\nnews page fourteen \u2022 incoming: your first\nletters arrive page seventeen \u2022 clued up page\nnineteen \u2022 standby pages twenty&twenty one \u2022\nseven day guide pages twenty two& twenty three H Superleague\nBY JOE MCFADDEN\nImperial College is one of an elite\ngroup of universities who are\nplanning to form a 'premier\nleague'.\nAbout. 10 top universities -known collectively as the Russell\nGroup - have been discussing\nways to protect, their research contracts in the face of increasing\ncompetition for funds from 'new'\nuniversities.

(and everyone is far too verbose)\nOSC Elections\nOpen letter to all International\nStudents,\nNow that you've all more or\nless settled down, you've listened\nto all the welcoming speeches and\nsurvived Fresher's Week, it's time\nto get you informed about what\nthe OSC is and what it does to\nkeep you happy. OSC or\n\"Overseas Students' Committee\"\ndeals with all the international students of Imperial College (EC and\nOccasional students included), it\norganises events (Disco Night,\nCultural and Food Fairs,\nInternational Week, International\nNite and more). For the fresher s and occasional students I shall\nexplain that \"International Nite\" is\nthe largest event of Imperial\nCollege that occurs in the second\nterm and attracts more than a thousand spectators every year. It\nincludes cultural shows and displays of various countries, food\nfairs, disco, live bands and more\nfun than you could possibly i mag ine.\nApart from organising events\nthe OSC also takes active part in\nall Union decisions, protects and\npromotes the interests of international students in the College and\nfinances the running of all the individual national societies.\nNaturally, all this takes a lot of\nwork, and many more people than\njust the members of the executive\ncommittee take part voluntarily.\nHowever, due to unforeseen\ncircumstances during the elections\nlast term, the executive committee\nhas not been formed in full, therefore there will be new elections on\nWednesday 1 9th October in the\nUnion Concert Hall (2nd floor\nUnion Building) at 1 pm for the\nposts that have been left empty.\nAnyone can stand, fresher to post-graduate, as long as he or she has\none proposer and five second ers. The name of the candidate, the\npost, as well as the names of the\nproposer and second ers should be\nwritten on the candidate papers\nthat have been put up in the\nWalkway and the Union building.\nThe papers will come down on\nTuesday 18th at 2pm. Each proposer will have the right to speak\nfor three minutes and each candidate will be able to give a short\nspeech for five minutes. In order to\nvote or stand, you have to have\nyour swipe card (or some other\nform of College ID) with you.\nIt is essential that every foreign\nstudent comes at least to vote,\nbecause it's your committee dealing with your interests and problems and you wouldn't want the\nwrong people to take the decisions\nfor you...\nAndreas Mershin\nOSC Chair 1994-1995\nHmmmm, that finished in the nick\nof time Andreas. Good luck with\nthe elections...\nConfusion\nDear Felix,\nLet me tell you about what happened on the night of Wednesday\nthe 5th of this month. A few of my\nfriends and I had decided just after\nten o 'clock, to see if all the events\nat the Union had finished yet. We\nhad heard that there would be a hypnotist, and wrongly thought\nthat once he had gone, entry\nwould be free. However, on entering the archway, our esteemed\nPresident informed us that we\ncould only stand in the Quad, if we\ndidn't pay \u00a33 to get into the Union\nproper. Having more sense than a stunned lemming, we decided that,\nwhile an hour and a half of board\ngames would be amusing, we did\nnot want to pay \u00a33 for the privilege. And so she grudgingly let us\nstay in the Quad while muttering\nthat we should \"Get a life\".\nSo, while a friend already there\ngot drinks from inside the Union,\nwe sat outside drinking, not taking\npart in the disco (which, at the\ntime, had all the life of a dead\nsloth on Valium), or the board-games. And this seemed as reasonable to us as the ICU people at\nthe doors of the Union to whom\nwe were in full view. But, in an act\nof incoherence brought on, we\nspeculate, because it was her\n'Time Of The Month', she declared\nus a security risk and ordered us\nremoved from the Quad. Which\nwas strange, since when we got to\nthe archway, the doorman seemed\nto think that it was perfectly within\nthe rules for people to stand in the\nQuad of their Union. But our all\nknowing President stated otherwise\nand ordered our drinks be confiscated and that we be kicked out.\nTo this day, we still do not know\nwhether it was the kindness in her\nheart, her generous personality,\nthe doubt on the face of the door-man, or the fact that we were four\n1 9/20 year olds who had imbibed\nalcohol that made her relent and\nlet us down our drinks before we\nwere forced to leave.\nAnd what is the point of all\nthis? It was no skin off our collective nose since we ended up having quite a good time at our\nfriend's flat dancing the night away\nwhile laying into his collection of\nbooze. The point is, if the Union\nwants us to cough up pound coins\nand notes to get into the Union, it\nshould provide something that's worth it. I would gladly have paid\na fiver to see the hypnotist, but \u00a33\nfor board games?\nA. Poon\nComputing 2\nThreats, wanton bach an lias m, fiscal\nconfusion, scandal in high places -get back to Private Eye A. Poon, this\nis a boring college paper!\nGlyph is Sad?\nDear Owain,\nQuite an impressive start to the\nyear, issue 1006 had news, features and only 7 pages of ads, and\nwhat an interesting piece by\nGlyph. Still I guess that many people didn't get past the first column\nof his diatribe and so didn't endure\nthe continued ranting s of this twisted soul.\nWell I read the whole page, I read it twice in fact, the reason\nbeing initially I had no idea what\nthe piece was about, but gradually\nit dawned on me. First he s lagged off the \"anorak brigade\", whatever\nthat is, then he touched lightly on\noverseas students before descending upon rugby players and such\nlike. Not only did he try to put\ndown the beer drinking males of\nIC, he also had a go at the women\ntoo, which apparently are fat,\nbearded and bigoted, yet it would\nappear that the author is perhaps\nmore bigoted than his subjects.\nThis is backed up by his next\nattack, this time on Rag. No originality here either, as he, like\neveryone before him who chose to\nput down Rag covered his back by\nsaying that \"collecting money for\ncharity is a reasonable past time\",\nwell this is exactly what Rag does\nso his argument seems a little con-fusing. However, a little further lies\nthe real reason for his comments\non Rag as he mentions that \"the\nEdited this week by\nOwain Bennallack\nlast two rag chairs have been les-bian s\". What, are they no longer\nlesbians? Were they only gay for\ntheir time as Rag chair? So the\nmessage obviously is - don't do\nRag, it'll turn you homosexual. This\nis, however, not true, as there\nhave been recorded cases of\nunashamed heterosexuality in Rag\nfor many years.\nWell then it's on to drugs and\nhow no-one is wistful and enigmatic, they're just pricks, whereas\nhe etc...(?).\nBut he hadn't finished. Just a quick blast at people in relation-ships, which is apparently a fate\nworse than death. However he\nimplies that if you're not in a relationship then people will wonder if\nyou're gay. Funny that, I would\nhave thought that people would\nassume you were gay if you were\nin a relationship, but just with\nsomeone of the same sex.\nYet now we come across the\nreal message in this article... beat\nthe system by going out with\nsomeone from the outside world.\nNot a Star Trek fan, an overseas\nstudent, rugby player, beer\ndrinker, Raggie (they're all gay), or\n\"drugs prick\". Hey, but what does\nthat leave you with, why, yes of\ncourse, Glyph, the man who put\npen to paper in such a wonderful\ncaring way. But it looks like the\npage long lonely hearts ad has\nfailed as he forgot to put a telephone or box number at the bottom of the page. So all the innocent fresher s who were so\nimpressed by his literary talents\nare going to have to settle for a beer drinking, rugby playing\nRaggie, or similar. I don't know\nwhy the article was titled \"The\nDocker's Fist\", but I'm sure Glyph\nwill get to know his fists quite well\nas they become his only friends,\nafter all he is an IC male and obviously really quite dull.\nThanks,\nHelen Teasdale\nMathematics 3\nThe feedback has been pretty fair\non this article: we've had some saying how good it is and a few\nloathing it to pieces. I have to play\nMr Democrat, but thanks Helen for\na reasonably coherent response\nrather than a \"you printed that\nscum?!?!\" My line is going to be\n'free speech' in all these issues...\nm OCT94 FELIX MM\n\n"

    "content": "Clued Up\nFrater liam\nWrites\nIt would seem that the anal retentive s have again put their foot\ndown in an attempt to remove the\nfumigating minions from the JCR.\nYour Frater observes with pleasure\nthe fact that those who choose to\ninhale nicotine have ignored the\npetty signs and continue to follow\ntheir will. Smoking may be hazardous, but only an imbecile could\ndeny its benefits. Nicotine, that\ncurer of coloni c cancer, that\nexpand er of mental capacity, that\nbringer of pleasure, is a chemical\nwhich brings aid to an enlightened\nmany and only afflicts those of\nmean intolerance. \"Smoking is an\nart form\", once saith 'Random', an\noccasional associate of mine. He\nglorified it as an aspect of the\nsculpture that was his life, and its\ndangers were merely an inherent\npart of that aesthetic is m. Oft would\nhe curl the delicate tube of a cigarette around his fingers to show me\nits beauty.\nThose who whine about addiction are equally misguided.\nAddiction is the fairest of delights,\nwithout which life would collapse\ninto the most deadening banality.\nThe Frater's own life consists merely of a loose knotted string of\nobsessive needs, the highest of\nwhich is the glorious correspondence with the Guardian A. For\nthose who wish to avoid the 1000\npollutants that accompany their\nnicotine fix, I would heartily recommend patches, nasal sprays or\naubergine s, which contain a sufficient concentration of the in toxin. The Frater himself is undergoing a period of ritual p reparative asceticism, for which he had been\nobliged to deny his need for the\ncigarette. But such abstention, or\n'giving up' as it is appropriately\ndubbed, is not necessarily a good\nthing. Don Juan warned Castaneda\nthat abstention is merely self indulgence That is a statement that\nshould be contemplated for some\ntime.\nThe more astute among my\nreaders may have noted the subtle\nalteration in my title. The unfortunate typo of the previous week cunningly shifted its cabal is tic sig-n if i can ce. Such mysterious changes\ncould be avoided by instilling computers with a sense of the\nQabalah: an idea suggested to me\nby a mathematical genius with\nwho mI had the fortune to be\nacquainted. He suggested that it\nmay also be a route to achieving\nA. I. POLITICAL\nSCIENCE\nMy thesis is very simple: Imperial\nproduces 'well behaved engineers'.\nLet me explain the vocabulary first.\n'Well behaved', is an adjective that\nindicates a particular attitude to\nworking on a process. A well behaved engineer works on a process, going from start to finish,\nwithout thinking about the wider\nconsequences of the process.\nI suppose the meaning of\nbeing well behaved comes from\nthe difference between the words\n'academic' and 'intellectual', which\nare not equivalent. More specific al ly, well behaved engineers are not\naware of what science does to\nsociety. The ability of science to\nalter the structure of society within\n5 0 - 1 0 0 years is awesome: robots\nhave replaced entire communities\nof work forces; the car has altered\nthe way Western society thinks and\nfunctions; contraceptives have given women a large degree of\nfreedom. And yet the graduate who comes out from Imperial is not\naware of these issues. He does not\nknow what sociological effect his\nscience has. Whether this ignorance comes from not being taught, or whether it is because the\nengineer is deliberately ignoring\nthe other, 'wider' issues is another\nquestion. Imperial College's prod-uc ts, its graduates, are en amour ed with the idea of technology. They\nare rigid in the belief of science as\nan end in itself.\nWhy are these engineers well behaved? Why are they acad-emi cge nui ses and intellectual\nbuffoons? The main reason, I think, is the way in which the engineers are taught. The engineer\nworks with 'nice' theories. Theories\nwhich have premises, conclusions,\nreasons, answers, connections,\nmeasurements. (This is the scientific culture that Kuhn talks about.)\nThere are two points to make about such a training. Firstly, the\nstudent is not taught about science\nin some context at all. 'Humanities'\ncourses are a rarity. Courses covering the philosophy and history of\nscience should be compulsory first\nyear ones, not added on as an\nafter thought.\nSecondly the student has\nbeen trained, brain washed even,\nto work with objects that fit into a scientific schema. To be made aware of any bad effects of the\nentire structure would cause him to\nquestion his very existence! The\nway out of this dilemma is to\nignore anything that lies outside\nthe schema.\nOf course, being well behaved suits the market: Industry\nrequires well behaved engineers;\nImperial produces them. Imperial\nrequires funds; Industry produces\nthem. But such a link, an implicit\nlink, would serve all parties\ninvolved: Imperial gets finance and\nstudents; Industry gets products\nand labour; graduates get jobs.\nEveryone wins?\nSamin.\nElimination Answers\na) Caledonian road; b) Seven\nSisters; c) Boston, Ruislip; d) Parson's Green; e) London\nBridge; f) Wood, Bounds; gj West\nHam; h) Chalk Farm; i) Elm\nMoor; j) Gospel Oak; k) Bond\nStreet; I) Grange Hill; m) Mansion\nHouse; n) Holland Park; o) Mile\nEnd; p) Warren, Cannon; q) Swiss\nCottage; r) Brent Cross; s) Oxford,\nPicadilly; t) Covent Garden\nWinning word: Euston\nProcter&Gamble\nCareer\nOpportuni -ties\nExperience\nbe22 Routes to gain Blue Chip\nTraining in Technical\nManagement\nFinal Year Students\n3 Day Residential Management Course, in\nUK, December 19, 20 & 21st1994 Penultimate Year Students\n10 week Vacation Work & Training, in\nEurope (Surrey, Newcastle, Brussels, Rome,\nFrankfurt, Paris) in July, August 1995.\nApplication forms on Chem, Biochem &\nChem Eng Notice Boards and at the\nCareers Office.\nClosing Date 26th October 1994\nFELIX "

    "content": "News and Editorial\nNews In\nBrief\nFellows\nThe following have been elected to\nthe Fellowship of Imperial College:\nProfessor Sir David Cox\n(Head of Mathematics 1.970-1974), Sir Ralph Robins\n(Chairman of Rolls-Royce pic),\nProfessor Abdns Salam (Professor\nof Theoretical Physics at, IC 1957-1993), Professor Roger Sargent\n(Head of the Department of\nChemical Engineering at Imperial,\n1975-1989 and Director of the\nCentre for Process Systems\nEngineering, 1989-1992) and Dr\nElsie Widdowson (President of the\nBritish Nutrition Foundation since\n1986).\nThey will be formally\nadmitted to the Fellowship by the\nChairman of the Governing Body,\nSir Frank Cooper at, the\nCommemoration Day Ceremony\non Thursday, 27 October 1994.\nBarter Bypass\nLocal Exchange Trading Schemes\n(Lets), the cash less barter schemes\nthat operate across the country,\nhave reportedly begun to target\nBritain's first year students at\nevents like Freshers' Fair.\nA directory lists the services\nmembers can provide and the\nwork they do is collected on a central computer. Running totals\nkeep track of 'credit and debt' but\nunlike some major high street\nbanks there is no charge for\nbecoming overdrawn. Services can\nbe nearly anything, from window\ncleaning to saxophone playing.\nStudents remaining with the\nconventional loans system face\nbleak statistics. According the the\nNUS they can hope to graduate\nwith around \u00a38000 of debts\n(Sunday Telegraph, 9/10/94).\nSuccession\nProfessor David Southwood,\n(Professor in the Space and\nAtmospheric Physics Group) has\nreplaced Professor Blow as the\nhead of the physics department.\nProfessor Blow, who was also\nProfessor of Biophysics, retired on\nthe 30th September 1994.\nHe had been at the helm for\n18 years, from 1976-1994.\nTravel to Israel\nCandidates arc invited to apply for\none of the 1995 Bessy Emanuel\nEducational Trust, Israel Travel\nGrants. The bursa ries, worth up to\n\u00a3500, are provided to students\ninterested in undertaking a personal project, in Israel. These\ncould such things as studies of\nethnic communities, e duct ion of\ngifted children or the care of the\naged in the, kibbutz.\nCandidates are invited to\nsubmit a brief outline of their\nproject idea by February 1 1995.\nThose interested can obtain\napplication forms from John DA Levy, Academic Study Group, 25\nLyndale Avenue, London, NW2\n2QB. Tel: 0171 435 6803.\nFlat Update\nSeveral kind readers have\nmanaged to bypass the heavily\ndoctored photograph hurdle\nabove to recognise me and to\nenquire, as to how my domestic\nlife (Re: Issue 1005) is going. Well,\nwe have, managed to move into a flat, that, (we believe) is actually\nowned by our landlord. It is a converted 'hotel' (Calcutta style)\nwith two bathrooms, at least one\nof which works at any time. We\nare living in the Polynesian style,\nwith low beds and furniture. In\nfact, the furniture is a door based\narrangement and our clothing is\nplaced in vertical piles in a 'Last,\nIn First, Out' queuing system. (We\nhave no drawers but, boy do we\nhave good acoustics).\nWe also have a nice space in\nthe kitchen for a fridge, currently\nlocated in another space,\nunknown, and our old friend who\nhad lodged himself in America has\nreturned to bargain the rent,\ndown, swap rooms and move into\nthe FELIX office.\nFlats: Can't live in them,\ncan't squat without: them.\nPostcards from Nowhercsville\nCould Anna of Biology please\ncome into FELIX and confirm\nher authorship of two letters I received this week. All letters must\nbe brought to the FELIX office\nwith a Swipe card, by the author,\nas unfortunately there have, been\ncases of fraud in the past.\nBest a brick in the face?\nI went to the anti Criminal Justice\nBill march on Sunday, shortly\nbefore it turned into a club 18-30\nsmash-and-scream shopping trip\ndown Oxford street. Basically, we\nsaw something bad going down\nand so we got out of there. Fifteen\nminutes earlier I had read a communist leaflet telling me to tell\nthe pacifists to 'push off and all\nalong Piccadilly black clad figures\nwith scarves wrapped around\ntheir mouths had scarp ered in rat\nlike packs. There were clearly\nelements out to cause trouble\n(c it her that or they were highly\nsusceptible to traffic fumes...)\nI hate the Criminal Justice\nBill on many levels and I thought\ntoo that I hated the police, or at\nleast the concept of a police force\n(although at a Trafalgar Square,\nmini-riot I almost vomited to see\none booted in the head five, feet\nfrom my feet). But this summer I visited Paris and saw thousands of\nthe French Police line the roads\nfor a tourist procession, gun on\nhip and snarl on face. I saw the\nanti-terrorist units in packs of six\nkick in a fruit, stall in a Metro\nstation screaming abuse and I 've\nseen a British constable, stand in a road surrounded by people\nscreaming 'Kill the Bill', unarmed\nand patient. So I don't hate them\nanymore.\nThe point of this long winded\nintra? After the, march/riot (believe\nthe press or the police) people\nwere saying 'the police just,\ncharged in' and 'they came in\nhuge numbers'. They talk about\nthe police starting the trouble\nwhen generally I think it is that\nthe police are simply the first, to\nhave to make a decision. Despite\nthe undeniable miscarriages of\nhumanity that have been\nperpetrated by the police, the fact\nis that they will be the first, ones to\nrisk injury in any situation. One\ndocs not generally feel on the\npoint of being assaulted when\nwalking in a demo, but they\ncontinually face that, threat\nunarmed and in smaller numbers.\nIn many countries, people dressed\nin terrorist, garb and masked\nwould be shot on sight, not left to\nsit planning on the steps of\nfashion stores. The police, have to\ngo in en masse when they do: if I had men and women doing their\njob and threatened with severe\nviolence under my command I'd be tempted to send the tanks in.\nThe police don't make the\nlaws: the government, you and\nme do (by actions or in actions) and no-one deserves to take a beating for another mans laws.\nConstitution\nSo today sees the first submission\nof the new constitution to a UGM,\na body it. seeks to make near\nextinct. My feelings are mixed. On\nthe one hand I mourn the passing\nof regular UGM's( which just a few years ago attracted many\nhundreds of students) and I doubt\nthe ability of SRC to achieve the\nnecessary level of 'open ess' and\ncommunication. I dislike the\nargument, that, the officers sitting\non it actually represent, the\nstudents their position denotes\nand if that is true then some are\nmore represented than others (eg.\na female in hall who plays hockey\nand dances vs. a studious scholar).\nOn the other hand I 've been\ntrying to get people to read a copy\nof the constitution that has been\non the FELIX front desk all\nweek. No-one has. What choice do\nwe have?\nThe UGM is at 12:30pm in\nBiology W2 and W3, Beit Arch.\nCredits\nEditor\nPrinter\nBusiness Manager\nAdvertising Manager\nEditorial Team\nOwain Bennallack\nAndy Thompson\nTim Bavister\nHelen Randall\nNews Andrew Tseng & Mike Ingram\nFeatures Kate\nClubs, Societies and Union Piers Daniell\nArt and Literature Jon Jordan\nCinema Wei Lee\nMusic Vik Bansal\nStandby Jon Jordan\nSeven Day Guide Wei Lee & Ivan Chan\nColumns Marcus Alexander\nLayout and Design Paul Dias\nPhotography Ivan Chan & Diana Harrison\nS Flles Tim Parsons\nEditorial Assistance\nCollating Last Week\nMarcus Alexander, Jon Jordan, Mike Ingram,\nPatrick Wood, Joe McFadden\nHelpfulness Simon Govier & Steven Newhouse\nFELIX "
