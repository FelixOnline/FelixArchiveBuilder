    "content": "Scientists know age at deal about the beginning of the Universe. Religion still lays claim to the first fr of a second however. John Hassard explains the latest work at CERN's new Large Electron Positron (LE\nGod: reducing Her job description\nRecently, the Pope endorsed the efforts of scientists\nstudying the beginnings of the Universe. Our theories\nand experiments say that about 15 billion years ago\nour Universe began with the Big Bang. The Pope has\nclaimed the period before that event as the exclusive\npreserve of theology but he need not worry about the\nscientists' encroaching on his turf: to look at Big Bang\nenergies, we would need particle accelerators the size\nof the Universe! One Physicist recently bragged that\nthe new accelerators were not doing away with God,\nbut merely reducing Her job description. The most\nimportant lesson to be learnt from particle physics is\njust how little we know, and how the Universe's imagination is so much better than ours.\nWhen we study particles at high energies, we are\nprobing the Universe at its extremes: we are studying\nthe fundamental building blocks of nature and the\nnature of the Universe almost at the beginning of time.\nAs we increase the energy with which we probe the\nuniverse, we decrease the size of the smallest\nstructure we can resolve. Our most usual tools for this\n'microscope' technique are accelerators.\nLast week saw the official opening of a new\naccelerator, LEP. The King of Sweden visited the site,\nas did the President of Switzerland. Even President\nMitterand took time out from worrying about Germany\nto marvel at LEP's extraordinary engineering and our\npreliminary results. Britain sent Mr. Robert Jackson.\nBig science is very expensive, the UK alone provide\n\u00a350m for CERN, but its goals are correspondingly\nlarge. It could be said that the statesmen and women\nwho attended saw the best example of huge,\nambitious international collaborations cooperating\ntowards profound goals and with technologies\nunrivalled in complexity outside the military arena.\nWe think that the Universe began as an\nextraordinarily hot burst of energy. As It cooled,\nstructures 'froze' out. These are well described by a remarkably simple picture, in which phenomena at all\nranges of energy and distance are governed by the\nsame sort of rules. There would appear to be four\nforces and only a limited number of fundamental\nparticles, all related to each other by the so-called\nStandard Model.\nThe model describes the way the building blocks of\nnature - the quarks and leptons - are related to each\nother and to the four known forces. The LEP\naccelerator is the biggest, most accurately made\nmachine in the World and will probably provide the\nbest insight into how the model performs.\nSo what are we doing at LEP? Science consists of\ntaking a hypothesis and testing it against experiments.\nIf the experiments disprove or are not quite compatible\nwith the theory, the theory is thrown out or modified.\nLEPers would like nothing better than to expose the\nweaknesses of the Standard Model, find its flaws, and\nif possible smash it to bits.\nIt is more likely that we will find something that says\nthat the Standard Model is OK as far as it goes but\nis not the whole picture. As babies, we knew about\ngravity: our food fell on the floor when thrown. As\nadults we can write down gravitational equations\nwhich can predict the way the mass of a star can bend\nlight itself. In the same way, our view of the Standard\nModel might be correct, but bears as much relation\nto the real picture as my young nephew's view of\ngravity does to Einstein's. It is already known that the Standard Model is\ninadequate in many ways. It EXPLAINS almost\nnothing, although it provides a framework for\ndescribing a lot. For example, where does mass come\nfrom? Prof. Higgs of Edinburgh suggests that it is due\nto a particle known as the Higgs' Boson. How are the\nparticles responsible for forces related to those\nresponsible for mass? A new symmetry known as\nsuper-symmetry has been put forward, but as yet\nthere is no evidence to back it up.\nThere are also many issues which are ill-understood.\nWhere is the last missing quark, known as the Top\nQuark. Why do we get violation of a simple symmetry\nin nature, known as charge-parity? It is like looking\ninto a mirror, raising your right hand and seeing your\nreflection also raise its right hand.\nWe have not really begun to answer to really\nimportant questions:\n\u2022 The generation puzzle, why are there distinct\nfamilies of quarks?\n\u2022 Why does our universe appear to have more protons\nand neutrons than anti-protons and anti-neutrons?\n\u2022 The quark-lepton connection, why do their families\nlook so similar?\n\u2022 Unification of all forces, why do all forces appear\nthe same as we probe deeper? Some people have\nproposed a theory incorporating string-like entities\nknown as Superstrings but no experiments have ever\nbeen proposed to test it. Is it a theory if it is\nun testable? \u2022 What is the Universe made of anyway?\nGravitational studies imply that the Universe cannot\nbe explained in terms of the matter we can see. One\nsuggestion is that 9/10 of the universe is not made\nup of quarks and leptons but of something now called\nDark Matter. Imperial College is heavily involved in an\nexperiment to study this possibility. It involves making\na new detector capable of measuring the SOUND a particle of Dark Matter makes as it hits a crystal\nlattice.\nLEP will be a surgeon's scalpel to the Standard\nModel. It is already established, after only a couple\nof weeks, that there are likely to be only three families\nof neutrinos, 3.2,^0.3 in physics parlance. That\ninformation might not sound like it is worth \u00a350m, but\nit implies a lot.\nPhysics relies and sits on beautiful intellectual\nedifices, highly dependant on symmetries. If there are\njust three families of neutrinos then there are probably\njust three families of quarks. In other words, all visible\nmatter, whether in Geneva or in the Crab Nebula,\nwhether now, or a thousand millionth of a second\nafter the Big Bang, belongs to one of these three\ngroups.\nAnother result already out concerns the way that\nthe primeval burst of energy turned into mass, literally\nhow the universe began. This transformation is\ncertainly governed by Einstein's E=mc2, but the\nprecise process, known as hadron is ation, lies in the\nrealms of the difficult subject of Quantum\nChromodynamics. Many models have been proposed\nover the last few years and our data will help model\nbuilders in their next attempts.\nWhat next? We may get a chance at the Higgs and\nthe Top. We will study in depth the possibilities of\nSupersymmetry. It could be that, in a few months time\nwe may find out that there are 3.2^0.01 families.\nSince a fractional number of families is impossible, it\nwill tell us that there is more out there than we\nthought. Optimists think that we may see\nsubstructure in quarks. Best of all, we will get\nsomething not on this shopping list, something\nunexpected, something that gives us INSIGHT.\nPage 10\n\n"

It included students from most London\ncolleges, as well as Bristol, Brighton and Manchester.\nThe Police estimated numbers to be between 2500\nand 5000, though the organisers thought there were\n'greater than 5000'. The march was preceded by a number of speeches calling for the solidarity of\nstudents and college staff over the loans proposal and\nstaff pay rise claims.\nThe march was accompanied by a heavy police\npresence throughout, though the only trouble occured\nat 2:45pm outside Euston Station when a group of\ndemonstrators realised that the march was going to\ntake them through backstreet s and started marching\nto Westminster instead.

    "content": "Nathalie Lieske retells her experience as a student from Imperial College\nat CERN during the summer.\nA student's viewpoint\nAs a scientific site CERN is unique. Your first\nimpression is of stark buildings and large warehouses\nscattered at random. Gradually the organisation\nbecomes apparent and the excitement and energy of\nthe people involved makes the place vibrant and\nattractive. There are two cafeterias, a hostel for\npeople on temporary stays, a bank, a post office and\na few newspaper shops.\nThe people at CERN enjoy what they are doing; at\nmeal times the bars are full of people chatting and\njoking, and talking enthusiastically about their work.\nThere are both experiment a lists and theorists at\nCERN, some of whom are there permanently, some\nvisiting. This flow of people from all over the world\ncreates an environment in which any manner of\nattitudes and outlooks are acceptable.\nCERN is humming 24 hours a day. The bar stays\nopen until 1am and opens again at 6am so there is\nno feeling of working in an isolated place.\nTo run an experiment it takes resources. The\ntechnology involved in these experiments is so\ncomplex that specialised groups are responsible for\ndifferent parts of it. The machinists who take care of\ngenerating the required particles, for example.\nDifferent experiments are given different priorities and\nthe machinist's time is dictated by many factors.\nThus, there are many constraints, and when a group\nis allocated time to run, they must make 24 hour use\nof the facilities. Therefore, all the members of the\ngroup, from all the different universities working on\nthe experiment, must go to CERN and work in shifts\naround the clock. Usually these shifts are eight hours\nlong; the number per week depends on the number\nof people available to take them.\nAt the same time, these people must also do\nphysical analysis of the data. This usually involves\nworking on computers, running and writing programs.\nAfterwards, the results must be matched to the\ntheory.\nI went to CERN as a summer student for three\nmonths during the summer, and was placed on a 'target experiment', where particles are thrown at a target surrounded by detectors all around and behind\nthe target. I was there from the installation of the\nexperiment until the end of the run.\nI learnt what was involved in the trigger electronics,\nhelping to make sure it was wired correctly and I ran\nshifts. There was even the excitement of firemen\nturning up one night; a false alarm! This experiment\nis one of the smaller ones, comprising only 30 people\nand I was therefore able to grasp the main elements\nof the experiment.\nNow I am doing a PhD in high energy and working\non ALEPH, one of the four detectors on the LEP ring.\nMy responsibility is analysing the data. It is very\nexciting and challenging, and the more I study, the\nmore I like it.\n'A funny thing happened on the way to the lab'\nScientific Humour Wanted\nPlease send all entries to: The Science Editor, FELIX\n^his\nWeek\n\u2022 Are children living near nuclear power stations\nmore likely to suffer from leukaemia and Hodgkin's disease? Even the nuclear industry admits that there\nare unusually large numbers of sufferers near its\npower stations and reprocessing plants although it has\nalways refused to accept any blame. Now it has the\nbacking of a medical report.\nThe report, in a recent edition of the Lancet,\nconcludes that there is some unidentified feature of\nthe sites, other than the low-levels of radioactivity,\ncausing the disease. Researchers working at the\nImperial Cancer Research Fund's Oxford Laboratories\ncompared childhood mortality rates from areas near\nnuclear plants to those from similar but 'clean' areas\nbeing considered for nuclear plants. The two sets of\nresults were said to be 'strikingly similar'.\nThere is now more evidence that low-levels of\nradioactivity do not cause disease. The researchers\nhave less certain results for the one site where both\nthe level of radioactivity and the risk of cancer are\nboth unusually high. The site is Sellafield.\n\u2022 In America, the Cold Fusion Advisory Panel of the\nDepartment of Energy (DoE) has recommended that\ncold fusion experiments should be given no special\nsupport. However, the Panel is split as to whether cold\nfusion is possible. One of its co-chairmen, Professor\nJohn Huizenga of the University of Rochester claims\nthat there is now no plausible evidence of heat-producing cold- fusion. The other co-chairman, Nobel\nLaureate Norman Ramsey, believes that the process\nhas yet to be convincingly disproved. All agreed that\nmore work was needed, but it should not have too\nhigh a priority.\n\u2022 Physicists will be travelling to Antarctica to start\nbuilding the first optical telescope at the South Pole.\nThe telescope will consist of an array of ten 1 metre\nwide heated-mirrors arranged on the ice and designed\nto detect the flashes of light made as ultra-high-energy\nparticles pass through the upper atmosphere. It should\nbe completed in three-years time.\n\u2022 A West German court has stopped the Hoechst\nchemical company from finishing the construction of\na plant designed to produce insulin using genetically\nengineered bacteria. The court ruled that it could not\ngrant a licence for the plant as there are no legal\nregulations covering genetic engineering. The German\nGovernment has been discussing such laws for the\npast year and the court's decision will increase the\npressure to implement them. Hoechst may try an\nappeal to a higher court.\n\u2022 An increase in solar activity has been blamed for\nblacking out most of the Canadian province of\nQuebec. The unusually high electrical activity tripped\nsafety cut-outs in the power lines. Expect more such\nincidents as the Sun builds up to its 11 year maximum\nin February.\n\u2022 In California, creationists fighting plans to give\nevolution a more central place in the school\ncurriculum, have scored a minor victory. To appease\nthe christian fundamentalists, members of the\nCalifornia Board of Education insisted on adding extra\nphrases to the guidelines for science teaching. Classes\nwill now be taught that some people reject evolution\non religious grounds.\n\u2022 Plug. On Tuesday 28th November Nigel Henbest\nwill be talking about 'The New Astronomy' in Physics\nLT2.\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "Repent!\nDear FELIX,\nI found the feature article in last week's FELIX on\npornography informative and shocking; a lot of hard\nwork and time obviously went into producing an\narticle on a difficult subject.\nHowever, I have two complaints; the first concerns\nthe presentation of the article, and the second\nconcerns the analysis of the subject.\nFirstly, your decision to plaster the front and back\ncovers of FELIX with pornographic photos and to\ninclude two photos of people having sex, a screen\nshot of a pornographic computer program, an\nadvertisement from a magazine and quotes from\nstories in magazines in the article was unwise. It was\ninsensitive, because sexual immorality and lust are\nsuch big problems at IC.\nMy second, more important, objection concerns\nyour analysis of pornography. You are right when you\nsay pornography is 'false'. However, you do not\nrealise where pornography comes from-it comes\nfrom Satan, the evil one, God's enemy. As 1 John\n5:19 says:\n'the whole world is under the control of the evil one'\nAlso, your article offers no hope\u2014it simply states\na problem. It's like someone telling you that you've\nbeen doing a problem sheet the wrong way for five\nhours and then walking away. The human condition\nis one of sin-rebellion against God. But, Jesus Christ\ncame to meet man's greatest need -for forgiveness,\nand deliverance from Satan. Again in 1 John 2:2 it\nsays:\n'Jesus Christ is the atoning sacrifice for our sins'\ni.e. Jesus Christ paid for our sins-the price we\ncould never pay. His blood, shed for us, can purify us\nfrom all sin.\nYours,\nRichard Marett (Maths 3).\nConfusion\nDear Dave.\nFurther to the letters you have published from the\nCommittee of the Hellenic Society and the Chairman\nof the Greek 'Cypriot Society', both of which no doubt\nrepresent the interests of Greeks in Cyprus, and the\nreply by STA, there appears to be a confusion about\nholiday adverts to the Turkish Republic of Northern\nCyprus and the human rights.\nIt is indeed ironic that the Greek Cypriots, seemingly\noblivious of the fact that they have even since 1963\npitilessly violated every conceivable human right of\nthe Turkish Cypriot population contrary to each and\nevery article of the international human rights\ncovenants, and would have certainly continued to do\nso had Turkey not intervened in 1974, are now\ncomplaining about violations of human rights in\nCyprus and trying to cover up their past disreputable\nrecord in this field.\nThere are no true reasons why holidays to Northern\nCyprus should not be advertised the same way as they\nare advertised to Southern Cyprus. Indeed they are\nhighly recommended. The unspoiled beaches with\ncrystal clear seas, the breathtaking historical\nmonuments and the tr an quality of the Girne harbour\nare some of the Turkish delights that should not be\nmissed.\nYours sincerely,\nFriends of the Republic of Northern Cyprus.\nName withheld by request.\nLock your\ndoors\nDear Dave,\nI would like to make it clear to all present ana future\nHamlet Gardens residents, that the burglary featured\nin last week's 'Hamlet Horror', was in no way due to\nany inadequacies in flat security.\nThe main contributory factor to the flat 131 breakin (apart from the burglar's upbringing), was the fact\nthat the last occupant to leave on Monday morning\nfailed to lock the Two 'Dead Locks' on their front\ndoor. Had these locks been on (whether the villain\nbroke the window in order to open the Yale lock or\nnot), the front door would have been virtually\nimpenetrable.\nDue to a mass of recently implemented security\nmeasures, burglaries at Hamlet Gardens are becoming\nincreasingly rare events. We now fare, in my opinion,\nfar better than the average Hammersmith residence\nand probably at least as well as other college\naccommodation.\nSo don't have nightmares, and keep 'em peeled.\nMatthew Bridgwater, Hamlet Gardens Warden,\nLaser Optics, Physics.\nMultissimi\nFascisti\nDear Dave,\nContrary to popular belief, Imperial College Union\nConservative Society is nor a society devoted to the\nsupport of neo-Thatcherite or ultra right wing political\ndogma. Why is this view so prevalent?\nCould it have anything to do with the fact that\nbeside the Society's entry in the Union Handbook\nappears a cartoon of Adolf Hitler in full salute, proudly\nbearing a Conservative Party badge? Surely not-after\nall that's just a bit of fun.\nCould it have anything to do with the fact that FELIX\nscrawled the word 'fascist i' across the front of a number of the Conservative Society's own\nhandbooks? Surely not-the Union's enthusiasm to\nprint our handbooks was entirely due to their\nwillingness to impartially help all IC clubs and\nsocieties.\nBut not all the inaccurate, not to mention blatantly\nfalse, portraits of the Conservative Society exist\nwithout its bounds. The public squabble between\nMark Page and Ashley Unitt over the former\nchairman's conduct do not help matters. But this too\nboils down to the non-political matter of whether you\nchoose a true devotee of a society as a chairman, or\nwhether you should choose someone not so\ncommitted, but having better skills of leadership and\norganisation. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact\nthat not one objection was raised against Nicky Fox\nbecoming an ordinary committee member of the\nConservative Society.\nThe truth of the matter is that the Conservative\nSociety welcomes members from a broad range of\npolitical beliefs. Nicky's predecessor as chairman, for\nexample, was a devoted Tory who did not himself\nbelieve in the merits of either the Poll Tax or Student\nLoans, or even Mrs Thatcher.\nYours sincerely,\nThomas Wyatt, ICU Conservative Society.\nHard to\nunderstand\nDear Dave,\nIn reply to the letter by George Kalisperides I would\nlike to point out one or two facts that people seem\nto be largely misinformed about. I find the insinuation\nthat Northen Cyprus is an 'illegal state' somewhat\nparadoxical as it was the Greek violation of the 1960\nconstitution, that recognised two separate Cypriot\ncultures and catered for the needs of both societies,\nthat led to the 1963-74 conflict. It should also be\nstressed that to depict the Turkish army as the only\naggressor in this situation is both false and misleading\nas the Greek armed forces had been in partial\noccupation of the island for some considerable time\nbefore the Turkish counter-invasion and are still there\nas an antagonistic force today. The stated position of\nthe Greek Cypriots for Cyprus has been, and is still,\nthat of Annosis, a complete unification with Greece.\nThis policy leaves no room for a peaceful solution to\nthe Cyprus problem when, implicit within this policy,\nis the removal of the Turkish population that makes\nup 30% of the Cypriot populace. I would also like to\npoint out in the same very emotive fashion as Mr\nKalisperides that many members of my family were\nuprooted from their homes, unfortunately I am not as\nfortunate as to have met all these relatives as some\nnever reached Northen Cyprus. The pressure brought\nto bear on the STA to remove advertisements for\nholidays in Northen Cyprus can only be considered to\nbe a stifling of individual's free choice that in a supposedly democratic country, I find hard to\nunderstand.\nFriends of Northern Cyprus.\nHolbein\nsqualor\nDear Editor,\nIn a recent issue of FELIX, you congratulated house\nwardens, sub wardens, etc on the lack of complaints\nreceived. I am sorry to have to contradict this\nsituation, but it is getting beyond a joke now.\nHolbein House, when I arrived had one operational\nshower (operational meaning a hot trickle for 63\npeople). Six weeks later this is still the situation; also\nfor the people on the first, second, third and fourth\nfloors not wanting to carry food and utensils to the\nbasement there is one cooker, in which only the grill\nand hob work, and these with no temperature\nmarkings (although for the last three weeks a microwave has been available).\nThe vacuum cleaner has been stolen (three weeks\nago) leaving no means of cleaning our rooms, and a leak on the first floor landing leaves a sopping floor\nfor us to stand on while we answer the telephone las\nno outgoing calls have been available for the last two\nweeks).\nI realise that this is the cheapest hall, and was never\nexpected to be the Hilton, but decent, hy geni c facilities are not unreasonable to ask for.\nAlso, I realise it is the College bureaucratic system\nfor repairs, insurance claims etc which is at fault, not\nthe Warden, but from remarks by friends in Willis\nJackson and Southwell, it seems some similar\nproblems exist there.\nI for one am already seeking private accommodation\nfor next term.\nI CR Jewyes, Geology 1.\nPage 17\n\n"

    "content": "Mary's Whitehouse?\nDear Dave\nI have just heard that the Dean of St Marys Medical\nSchool, on seeing the delivered copies of the last issue\nof FELIX, had an attack of the Hitlers and destroyed\nthem. The reason, as I understand it, was that he felt\nconcerned about the possibility of their being seen by\npatients, who would presumably be unable to cope\nwith the admittedly contentious subject matter. If this\nis the case, why didn't he simply tell his students this,\nor even send back the copies? This would have cost\nhim nothing, whereas it cost IC Union about \u00a340 to\nproduce them. No, he had to destroy them.\nSomeone should tell Professor Richards that we left\nthe nineteen fifties behind some decades ago, and\nthat the modern day senior academics of teaching\ninstitutions are generally expected to behave rather\nless like crusty old tyrants. Not, of course, that I am\nimplying that the Dean of St Mary's is a crusty old\ntyrant; perhaps we should ask a Mary's student?\nProfessor Richards is obviously used to having his\nstudents under his thumb. He should be made aware\nthat non-medical members of this College need not\nworry about getting a reference in order to start\nhospital or practice work, and therefore can feel free\nto say and print their opinions of him and his actions.\nBeing called to book for his actions by students could\nbe quite a refreshing experience for him.\nIn case IC students on the South Kensington site\nare wondering what all the fuss is about, imagine how\nyou would feel if the Dean of C and G, RCS, or Mines\ndestroyed your Friday morning read, especially if their\nbest reason was that it was 'unsuitable' - in their eyes.\nImagine how you would feel if you perpetually had to\nstay in the Deans good books, on pain of getting a sour reference and no job.\nPerhaps we who have no need to fear this\ncensorious man should rename him Mary's Whitehouse.\nName wit held by request.\nCrap posters\nDear Dave,\nRe. Mr Meyfroidt and UGM Publicity.\nIs putting up 100 hundred posters one day before\nan event regarded as doing a good job? If UGMs are\nso crucial, and the motions debated there of the\nutmost importance, then shouldn't people be allowed\nto mull over them, and try to rearrange their diaries\nover a long period of time than 36 hours, 16 of which,\non average are spent sleeping?\nYours,\nTony Spencer.\nComment\nI have received a number of letters on the issue\nof pornography. A few of them were well thought\nout. I was pleased to see a variety of viewpoints.\nA common feature of most of them, however,\nwas a complaint about the cover. I tried to tone\nthe cover down to an abstract image by printing\nit in a faint orange; this was not good enough for\nsome it seems. The comment that summed up my\nfeelings on the whole issue was that made by one\nof the plaint if s. 'What was wrong, you could\nhardly see what was on the cover,' somebody said\nto him. 'Yes, but if you hold it up really close...,'\nsaid Mr Ritzperis. The summary of the argument\nis that if you did not want to look you didn't have\nto. Those who wished to ogle and complain later\nwere perfectly at liberty to leave the issue in the\ndepartment. Too many people obviously hadn't bothered to read the feature. Their arguments\nwere facile and uninformed.\nThe only viewpoint that really got my goat was\nthe Christian one. It seems I am somehow related\nto Satan, the evil one. I have checked my family\nhistory carefully and Mr B. Eelzebub does not\nseem to figure in it. I have not studied the Bible\nto the point of mindless quotation either, although\nI thought the bit on Solomon was quite naughty.\nI am sorry if I do not hold such strictly blinkered\nreligious ideals, but I prefer to remain open to\nreasonable debate. As one person said, 'Jesus\nsaves, but Felix scores on the rebound.'\nI still feel that the article was worthwhile. It\nraised an extraordinary amount of debate\nthroughout College on an issue which many\npeople would prefer to push under the carpet. If\nit had been presented in a more restrained form,\nit would have been 'just another feature.' I tried\nto wake people up a little and make them think\nabout something other than the next problem\nsheet-admit it, you did.\nHaving said all that I still apologise to anyone\nwho was immensely upset by the photographs.\nI do not want to see any more letters on the\nsubject of Ms Marsh and the Life Science\ndepartment. I think the matter has gone far\nenough. I shall allow one more week on the\nsubject of Cyprus before it bores me to death. As\nfor ConSoc-you can have as much rope as you\nwant folks.\nEd\nMONITOR COMPANY\nSTRATEGY CONSULTANTS\ninvites all undergraduates and graduates\nwho would like to discuss career opportunities\nwith Monitor to attend a presentation\nat\nThe Chesterfield Hotel, 35 Charles Street, Wl\non Wednesday 29th November 1989 at 7pm Further details from Rebecca Mayhew, Monitor Company Europe Limited,\n14 Grosvenor Crescent, London SW2X 7EE "

    "content": "Susan Appleby interviews 'Tite Man From Delmonte' at l.C. Radio last Friday before their gig at the Guilds Carnival.\nFruit And Tunes\nPlaying at the Guild's Carnival last week for what was\na return gig at IC were The Man From Del Monte,\nprima ril iy a live band with a strong following in the\nNorth, based around Manchester. While the fruit juice\nflowed I spoke to Sheila, the bassist and Howard,\ndrummer from the band, about football fans, babies\nand peculiar pop songs.\nI was going to ask you about fruit juice; that was\ngoing to be my main question. Tell me about fruit\njuice.\nSh. Never buy Del Monte, it's very dod gy. Well I don't anyway, but...\nSh. The name...just seemed like a good name;\nsomething that would stick in people's minds. It\nworked at the beginning, mainly because people\nthought they'd heard of us.\nH. 'Seen you on the telly!'\nSh. That's right. But then it worked against us,\nbecause people thought we were something to do\nwith South Africa, apartheid, I don't know.\nH. It's a bit of a cross to bear. I'm surprised, now, how\nmany people aren't offended by it.\nYou've been together for three years now; have\nyou changed much in this time?\nSh. I think we've got better...the line-up hasn't changed. I think we've got more professional.\nH. We can play now!\nSh. But some bands start up and they're really good\nat the beginning.\nH. We were really awful!\nSh. And then don't progress...\nHow would you describe your music?\nPage 6\nSh. John! Where's our manager? He can answer that\none.\nHe's not in the room.\nIt's good for dancing to. ..and it's got lots of tunes in it.\nH. Thoughtful and melodic.\nThoughtful, in what sense?'...A lyrical sense?\nH. Well in a way, this is why the music press don't mention us-they can't attach us to anything\u2014Mike\nwrites very peculiar songs.\nHow are they peculiar?\nThey're very personal, all about him, all on acoustic\nguitar...we've only just gradually worked out what to\ndo with it all now.\nSh. We don't try to sound like anyone else...I mean\nI listen to Tina Weymouth, bassist from Talking Heads\nand I think yeah, I could do that, because she's not\na great technical player-for me it's to do with playing\ntunes on the bass. That's changed in the past few\nyears: we've become more rhythmic.\nWe're a very live band. There's an energy that\ncomes from the live playing, and it's really hard to\nreproduce that in the studio...it's really hard to get the\nsense of what the song means.\nWhat's the Manchester scene like...you seem all\none big happy family almost? Is it really like that?\nNO! We don't know anyone, no. Is 'pose there are a lot of bands and you do see them around, so everyone\ndoes know of everyone else.\nBut you're not all going to wild parties together?\nH. No, I suppose if you're really trendy you've got the\nHacienda, places like that, but...\nSh. I think our manager goes.\nH. He likes to keep in touch.\nSh. Yeah, but I have a kid, I don't go out very much.\nWhat did you think about the Smiths leaving\nManchester after they said they never would?\nSh. It was probably just as well they left when they\ndid, or there wouldn't have been room for all the\nthings that are happening now.\nH. The fans in Manchester are all hysterical. If they\nspotted Morrissey in the street he'd be ripped apart.\nAlthough Mick Hucknall wanders around freely-he's a bit ugly though.\nSh. He's not got the same sort of star quality as\nMorrissey, I suppose...\nH. We live in Manchester, but we're not really a 'Manchester band'. Maybe that's what we're doing\nwrong with the music press...\nSh. Yes, we should say it's all lies that Mick's Australian and I'm Scottish-we're all true\nMancunians really! Actually we get a lot of people at\nour gigs who, if there's a bit of a gap between songs,\nstart shouting 'Manchester, Manchester' you know.\nI really hate that.\nH. Yeah it's surprising, I mean James get it too.\nSh. We played in Leeds once, and James had warned\nus about the crowd in Leeds-and right at the end of\nthe night there were these guys fighting in front of\nthe stage: It was really scary...\nThe Man from Del Monte have an album due out\n'sometime next year'-you can catch them\nsupporting the Primitives tonight at the Town and\nCountry Club though. This interview will be\nbroadcast on IC Radio on Monday between 7 and\n8pm. "

    "content": "FeliX I have decided that this week's editorial should take\na different form. Professor Peter Richards has voiced\nhis views on FELIX to several people now. He has said\nthat FELIX is a rag no better than the Sun, although\nnot to my face. Last week he took such offence to\nit that he had it destroyed. I do not think that he will\nbother to read FELIX this week. I am therefore printing\nthe letter which I shall be sending to him as my\neditorial.\nDear Professor Richards\nIt was with great regret that I heard of your decision\nto have last week's copies of FELIX destroyed.\nI am most grateful for the statement which you\nhave graced my news editor with. It was nice to hear\nwhat had happened by rumour and hearsay initially,\nrather than the usual courteous message which one\nexpects to receive on such an occasion. At least we\nhave a concrete set of excuses now.\nI should like to start by informing you about FELIX\nsince you seem to have been missing out on the idea\nof a student newspaper for so long. FELIX is\nrecognised as one of the top five student newspapers\nin the country by the national press, and here I do not\ninclude the Sun. It does not win awards as such since\nthe students union is not affiliated to the NUS, which\nruns them. (NUS stands for National Union of\nStudents.)\nYou say in your statement that FELIX 'is not noted\nfor' being a journal concerned with 'serious\ncomment.' I can only presume that this is based on\nyour own narrow viewpoint, and amounts to nothing\nmore than what you would call 'misrepresentation.'\nTaking aside the attitude problem which you seem\nto suffer in this area, I have to question both your\ndecision to 'bin' FELIX and the way in which you did\nit. I accept that the cover was a bad thing to have on\ndisplay to members of the general public, especially\nif there was a danger of minors getting hold of it,\nhowever I have no control over the distribution point\nfor FELIX at St Mary's. The issue was designed with\na limited distribution in mind-if I had realised the\nsituation at Paddington I would have sent special\ninstructions for its distribution, or maybe not even\nsent it. Now I know better.\nI could have accepted a decision to remove the\ncopies and either return them to me or ring me to pick\nthem up or even distribute them in the students'\nrefectory. What I found disgusting was the arrogant,\nLord-almighty attitude which lead you to destroy\nproperty which did not belong to you. This was\nannoying. What was just downright rude was your\nreluctance to speak to me or even let me know what\nyou had done.\nThe idea of actions without consequences by hiding\nfrom your victims is one which I do not think is a wise\none for a Dean to promote. By destroying those copies\nof FELIX you have wasted money and, more\nimportantly, students' valuable free time which they\ndonated to the production of FELIX.\nI would like to end this letter by pointing out that\nyour action was a form of censorship. Students from\nSt Mary's will not be able to 'obtain a copy from\nImperial College' as you put it (funny I thought we\nwere all IC now); there are none left at the South\nKensington site.\nYours sincerely\nDave Smedley\ncc Students of Imperial College of Science\nTechnology and Medicine.\nStaff Meeting\nI would like to call a staff meeting for next Tuesday\nlunchtime, 12.45pm. We will be discussing the\nChristmas issue.

I glanced from left to right\nin the vague hope that something would remind me\nthat this was a 'gig'.\nUp in the gods Queen Victoria sniggered as Prince\nAlbert pissed in my ear. And then there were two.\nThe Indigo Girls tell stories of middle-class angst.\nOf how on foreign-exchanges their boyfriends left\nthem, post graduation trips to Europe become Edna\nO 'Brien-esk discoveries 'There are mountains in\nSwitzerland with snow covered tops', and that love's fire does burn eternal. Their passion and sincerity left\nFor 90 minutes the Dominion Theatre is heaven on\nearth, presided over by an angel of music in the form\nof Mary Margaret O 'Hara. Mary, dip py diva of the folk\nworld, hails from Canada but has strong Irish roots.\nThe result is a true original. On stage she seems\nslightly out of step with her surroundings, though she\nsoon wins over the audience with her kooky charm\nand oddball sense of humour, but then most of us\nhave been under her spell ever since her bewitching\ndebut album Miss America burst onto the scene a year\nago.\nWhen she sings magic is involved. Her unique vocal\nstyle ranges from hauntingly beautiful ballard s like\nDear Darling and High in the Dark, to the furious,\nme cold and I wondered why the grabbing hand of the\nmusic business and the talent of Tracy Chapman had\nunleashed such a non-ent it it y to chug up the middle\nof the road. They were niggling ly pleasing in a faceless\nsort of way but comfort can always be found in the\ncompany of the bland.\nThe 10,000 Maniacs have the same sedating\neffect. If asked why I like them I couldn't answer but\ntheir music has a soothing, calming quality about it\nwhich draws you closer but never allows you to touch.\nLive, the Maniacs are a distant beauty. Natalie\nMerchant a figure akin to Heidi on acid but with a nerve-jangling rants that are Not be Alright and Year\nin Song. She becomes totally caught up in her own\nperformance, seemingly oblivious to ourselves as her\nvoice soars and carries us with it, deep into inner\nspace.\nAbout five songs into the set she jokes about it\nbeing time to say goodnight. We laugh, and then she\nsays 'Don't laugh, soon it will be true' and, indeed,\nthe thought that this wonderful experience will\neventually have to end is not at all funny. Then Mary\nis off again and rational thought becomes impossible\nunder her vocal onslaught.\nGuy Hilton.\npersonality that could never hope to fill the vastness\nof the hall, but what a voice.\nThe seating as ever acted as some form of perverse\ncontraceptive between band and audience.

Injecting\nthe stereo with rushes of stabbed rampant hot sonic\nsensation the music twists and lurches, vomiting out\nof the mighty sound towers in saliva spitballs covering\nall in its path with its lusty stain...savaging the fear\ncadet imprisoned within the slob fortress. The space\nhopper ignites but the freak flag remains high phlegm,\nphlegm of the couch potato command, flows through\nthe collapsed sewer veins with the caretaker mentality\nin versed at the vile antics of super yo b... the\nEuroseparists with tuff veggie a gro go 24 hours at\nNorthern prices. Sweating to be kept at a minimum.\nAnd if you think that's weird, listen to the record.\nB.G. Kevin McDermott Orchestra\nHealing\nThis new 12\" from Island Records is a nice sounding\nrecord by a band with some obvious talent.\nThe title track on side one sounded good with nice\nrhythm and harmonies all the way through. The\nslightly indie rhythm guitar was alright, but I was\nnever too convinced about its sound. There was some\nsubdued piano playing in the background which\nsounded suspiciously like Bruce Hornsby-friends in\nhigh places perhaps?\nI felt the song was a little over-produced, espeically\non the vocals and this could have been the fault of\nthe person who remixed the track. Also, it wasn't really suited to a12\" single-it could have been much\nshorter and had a proper ending instead of a really\nobvious fade out.\nSide two has To My Diary, a solo piece very much\nin the vein of Tracy Chapman. The acoustic guitar\ngave a really nice sound and this time the vocal\nsounded real despite the master tape having been\nstretched half way through!\nThe record finishes off with a cover of a Beatles\ntrack, You Can't Do That and is the band having some\nfun. Good to dance to, it feels like a song they would\nplay live.\nOverall this is an interesting record with three totally\ndifferent songs showing the diversity of this relatively\nunknown band.\nB.G.

    "content": "Mascotry bargain basement by Simon Banton\nEarly in the morning of March 14, 1989, two people\nclimbed into the Mines ground floor storeroom through\nan open window. They emerged several minutes later\ncarrying the RSMU mascot, Davy. Everyone expected\nthat Davy would be handed back in return for a large\namount of money raised for Rag. Sadly, everyone was\nwrong.\nThe Royal School of Mines Union, possibly the most\nautonomous of Imperial's Constituent College Unions,\nis justly very proud of its traditions and history. The\nannual rugby match against Cambourne for the\n'Bottle' is the second oldest varsity match in the\ncountry, and receives great support. This just makes\nthe lack of interest in present college traditions, more\nspecifically Davy, all the more curious.\nPerhaps the hope that RSMU would actually make\nan effort to raise any money for Rag was ill-founded.\nAfter all, the last time Davy was violated, in 1983-84,\nRSMU were less than keen to get him back. After\nmonths of trying to get the miners involved in any kind\nof fund-raising activity, RCSU eventually had to give\nup. In the end, Davy was returned for the proceeds\nof six hours collecting outside Harrods, a mere\n\u00a3167.83.\nIt is sad to see that in the years since then, nothing\nmuch has changed. Even in a time of more and more\nmergers, RSMU seem content to let their identity slip\naway into Just another insignificant part of the\nUniversity of London.\nThe attitude of Mines is in complete contrast to that\nof City and Guilds College Union who, last year, after\nthe theft of Spanner and Bolt, managed to raise\n\u00a31,100 for their return. This was accomplished in\nvarious ways, some silly (showing your knees to the\nRector), but all of them fun, and not impossible to\nachieve. At least City and Guilds seem to want to keep\ntheir individuality and self-respect.\nIs it really too much to ask that Mines should at least\nattempt to raise some money. It is surely a damning\nindictment of the apathy present in RSM as a whole,\nthat even at four days notice, not one miner could be\nbothered to turn up to the RCSU Smoking Concert as\nrequested. Even at six days notice, not a single\nmember of RSMU could struggle out of bed by early\nevening to accompany RCSU members on a pub crawl\nin order to raise money for Leukaemia Research. In\nfact, it was even too much of a struggle to inform\nRCSU of their impending non-arrival.\nMany people will argue that mascot ry is a waste\nof time, achieving nothing. Apart from helping to\npreserve colleges' identities, each year on average,\nmascot ry raises around 5-10% of Imperial College's Rag total, not an insignificant amount. This is, of\ncourse, providing that people can be bother d to get\nout and do something.\nIn an attempt to keep tradition alive, and to keep\nDavy within Imperial, the RCSU has a proposition to\nmake. Davy will be sold to any department, hall,\nhouse, landing, staircase, lecture or tutorial group,\nsports team, club, society, group of friends, or even\nto Guilds. In fact, anyone who can be bothered to get\nout there and raise a decent amount of money can\nhave Davy. Davy will, of course, remain a violate\nmascot. If you're interested, there are a few things\nyou'll have to do first, just to show us you really mean\nbusiness.\nFirstly, some publicity. A banner should be hung\nacross Beit Quad, from the west to the east walls,\nfacing so as to be readable from the main arch on\nentering the quad. The bottom of the banner should\nbe at least 15 feet off the ground at it's lowest point.\nOn it should be the following message, in letters no\nless than 30cm tall, and of an appropriate width to\ntheir height. The writing should be in con stra sting colour to that of the banner.\nThe message is 'Dear RCSU, RSMU are useless, we\nwant Davy'. The lettering must be exactly that written\nabove, in English, and with nothing else on the banner.\nAlso this banner should be the only one in the Quad.\nSecondly, the banner must remain up for the\nduration of the opening hours of the Union Bar on that\nday.\nThirdly, as soon as possible afterwards, a letter\nstating who your group is, and containing\nphotographic evidence that it was in fact you that put\nthe banner up, should be delivered to:\nTHETA, c/o The RCSU Office, Old Chemistry.\nFurther negotiations as to the amount required, and\nthe manner in which it is to be raised will then be\nentered into.\nMOTAQUIP\nWin two tickets to !WJ8fH\u00ab\nThe Rallycross event of the year takes place on\nDecember 2nd/3 rd on the custom built 0.9 mile part-tarmac, part-gravel Brands Hatch track.

    "content": "Fencing\nSurrey \u2014 6\nKent1 IC \u2014 2 1\nlm peri al26 Last Saturday, IC hosted the first rounds of the UAU\nfencing tournament for the South East North and\nSouth East South divisions. At 10am, fencing teams\nfrom 8 universities and colleges descended on\nSouthside Gym. By 9pm,297 bouts and at least one\nnervous breakdown later, Imperial had vanquished the\nopposition in the South East South division and UCL,\nour arch rivals, had won the South East division.\nThe ladies competition passed off uneventfully for\nus, as unfortunately two out of three of IC's female\nfencing team could not turn up. For the record, Royal\nHolloway were the eventual winners.\nThe men's competition started with the sabre. IC's truly 'international' sabre team started in splendid\nstyle, with the enthusiasm of Tony Chambers, the\nGallic flair of Maruice Ricou and the elegance of Joerg\nPollok combining to produce 8-1 victories over both\nSurrey and Kent. The foil is tst! ien continued to\nclinically dispose of both Surrey and Kent (8-1 and 9-0\nrespectively), with Gully Burns in fine form and\nnewcomers Nick Hills and Simon Laight putting in\nexcellent performances. Finally came the e pee. Our\nteam started hesitantly and to our dismay lost the first\nthree bouts against Surrey. However, led by an\naggressive assault from Adam Sadler, they fought\n^ck to win 5-4. Having thus warmed up, Adam, Peter\nCripwell and Simon Evans cruised home with an\nawesome 9-0 victory over Kent,\nOctopush\nBefore departing for Putney a few of us couldn't resist\nattending Nicky's and Sabine's training lectures, we\nthought the hyperventilating and resuscitation might\ncome in useful later on.\nAfter a quick warm up, and loans of equipment to\nthe opposition, the game got underway. Putney\nopened the scoring with a few quick goals. At this\npoint our subs it uti on strategy was a little disorganised\nbut a cunning tackle by Keith, a short sprint up the\npool followed by a good pass to Colin Waterhouse\nmeant all he had to do was tap the 'squid' (puck) into\nthe goal. Annoyed at this, Putney scored a few more\ngoals. Seth then circled at ew times in front of their\ngull (goal) and then flicked the squid past their two\ndefenders into the gull. Our remaining goals were\nrumoured to have been scored by Phil and William.\nThe final score was, a not too embarrassing, 8-4\nto Putney.\nFootball\nCharing Cross 1 st3 IC 3rd3 Searching for their first league win of the season IC\nmade an impressive start going 0-3 down within 20\nminutes. Attempting to double their league points IC\nhad played their joker-Alan Sinclair in goal. Following\na good performance during the half-time team talk,\nthings went drastically wrong when Ian Evans pulled\none back. Gary Stephens rattled the woodwork with\na looping header before Karl Gill made up for an earlier\nmiss by rounding the keeper and eventually deciding\nto score. IC completed a fine comeback against the\nleague leaders when a rasping Mike Dewey 60 yard\npiledriver was too hot to handle for the keeper and\nCarlyon Knight-Evans gratefully bundled the ball in.\nFor the last 10 minutes Karl Gill booted everything into\norbit believing IC were winning 3-2.\nPage 14\nHockey\nKent III O IC 111\u20141\nKent provided us with changing rooms and pitches\nthat, after the opulence of the RHBNC facilities were\nbeyond belief, and an 'international' umpire who\nprovided some of the best decisions ever encountered\nby the thirds. They also fielded the only other\nBoat\nOn Saturday, IC Boat Club reaffirmed their position\nas the most successful boat club in Britain by winning\nfour divisions in the Head of the River Fours, raced\nover the Boat Race course in reverse. IC's first IV\nachieved the boat club's highest ever position,\nwinning Senior I cox less fours, finishing only 1 second\nbehind a Great Britain crew. The other division\nwinners were the Senior II cox less four, and women's quadruple scull composite crew and the novice cox ed four. The Novice Pennant has now been won three\ntimes in succession by IC.\nThe other cox ed fours, however, were unlucky and\nall finished 4th in their respective divisions behind\nsome excellent crews. Nevertheless, all competing IC\ncrews finished in the top 160, out of an entry of 500\nand all looks well for the future when eights races\nstart.\nOrienteering\nOxford, Cambridge, Glasgow, Sheffield, Newcastle,\nNottingham, Leeds....beaten by IC in a boat race! Yes\nfolks it's true yet again.\nLast weekend Imperial College Orienteering Club\nwent to Cambridge for the annual university 'sprint-o' championships. The standard was very high with\nalmost the entire Junior and Senior British squads\ncompeting. The first round was over 6km with the\nfirst 50% going through. Tone Nystron and William\nPower from IC went through to the next round, but\ndue to the high standard no one got through to the\nfinals.\nWe all got back for the 'al co run' - a drink at each\nof the five controls.\nThe evening was far more exciting. Firstly dinner\nat Trinity College after a sherry reception and, most\nimportantly, the boat race. The prestige of IC was held\nof course, and we won despite starting last.\nundefeated third eleven in our division.\nIn a tough first half, neither side dominated until\nNigel, the pink elephant, picked up the ball in our 'D'. He proceeded to dribble the ball the full length of the\npitch, avoiding all attempts by the opposition to tackle\nhim, before selfless iy passing to the excellently placed\nRobert Powell, allowing him to score a well deserved\ngoal. Nigel was then forced to leave the pitch, and,\nwithout their pink pachyderm, the Imperial team lost\ntheir characteristic flare.\nThe second half saw a change of umpires and\nseveral dangerous attacking runs by the re invigorated Kent side, who were just held by our strong defence\nof Eric Sie and the 'other' one. The many attacks\nmounted by our offence were repelled by the Kent\nback row who threw themselves bodily into their\ndefence.\nSpecial praise should be given to Kevin Hill who has\nnow led us to victory in every match of our UAU\ndivision. His last minute appointment of Nigel to the\nteam was the final stroke in an excellently planned\ncampaign that has brought us to triumph in the local\ndivision. We will now go on to the next stage to meet\nan, as yet, unknown opposition.\nPS. We want all you budding hockey players who\nplay, or have played, for the Mens IV's, and any\npotential lady players, to turn up to a meeting on\nTuesday, 28th November at 12.30pm in the Union\nSnack Bar. Refreshments provided!\nKent 1 1 - 1 IC II\u20143\nIC entered the game with high hopes of victory, and\na place in the last 16 almost guaranteed. They came\nacross are s ili ant Kent defence, and far from inept\nattack. During the first half the honours looked like\nremaining, even until two minutes before half time.\nA fine ball from Dom Howard gave Colin Wright acres\nof space and bags of time to slot the ball home and\nput IC one up at the interval.\nAfter the break IC came out in an attempt to put\nthe game out of Kent's reach as quickly as possible.\nThey took no time in gaining a short corner and in the\nensuing- melee in front of the goal, Steve Burton\nscrambled the ball home. This, it was hoped, would\nkill Kent off. Far from it-they replied almost\nimmediately to make the score 2-1.\nIC's third goal came as a result of another short\ncorner. The 'clean' stop by Dave Millard taking a deflection after being struck, and as it looped goal\nbound, a deliberate offence by a Kent player on the\nline gave IC a penalty flick. Colin Wright stepped up\nand only just hit the ball past the stranded Kent keeper\nto give IC a good lead. On the final whistle the\nvictorious boys returned for a night of celebration, less\nthe first team who had pissed off early leaving their\nsense of humour at Heme Bay. What happened to\nthose 'scales'??\nGolf\nAfter drawing away against Surrey Universitythanks to strong performances by Robin, Jon and\nRhys-the next match was away against Kent\nUniversity. Playing in difficult conditions, Imperial\nCollege Golf Team came through winning 4-2 at\nPrince's Golf Club, Sandwich. This result means that\nImperial College top the league putting us through to\nthe last 16 in the knockout round of the UAU\ncompetition.\n\n"

    "content": "Pet Sematary\nFilm\n'I don't want to live again,\nI don't want to be buried\nin the Pet Semataryl'\nThe cynical amongst us may say that this just about\nsummed up Stephen King's version of his celebrated\nbook of the same name. All horror films are incomplete\nwithout the same old corny setting: 'Young family\nmove into small, backward town in Maine unaware\nof the evil that lurks there, but they're sure gonna find\nout...' But giving the cat and the 2 year-old their due,\nthey command a pretty scary last half hour.\nThe Pef Sematary itself is a place where local kids\nhave buried little Rover or Felix for nigh on sixty years.\nOne of the characters observantly points out that you\ncan tell the sign at the entrance has been done by kids\n'cos it's spelled wrong'. And so it is. Hero, Louis Creed\nis warned not to venture into 'the place beyond the\nPet Sematary', but sure enough the next day his\nneighbour initiates him into the place's chilling\nsecret...His daughter's cat gets killed, Louis buries it\nin 'the place' and it comes back to life; but this time\nwith fluorescent eyes and a decidedly rabid\ntemperament. The fun starts from here-or as the\npublicity says-'Louis Creed has begun a deadly,\nterrify inc. exploration'.\nIt's interesting though how a film can be both\nlaughably predictable and seat-gripping ly frightening\nat the same time. There's no shortage of 'classic\nhorror' camera shots and the dialogue and plot are\nconsiderably 'cringe able' in places.\nSo, as horror films go this isn't too bad. In fact, for\nall the philosophers out there it even has a catch\nphrase: 'Sometimes dead is better'. Nice\nperformances too from the two children and the cat,\nwho in particular showed considerable versatility. We\nwere left feeling slightly shaken and amused,\nespecially by the ridiculous title song by The Ramones\nplayed with the credits; 'I don't want to be buried in\nthe Pet Sematary'.\nStephanie Kivi & Adrian Pagan.\nPoor beast in the rain\nTheatre\nA betting shop in Wexford, Ireland, on the eve of the\nall-Ireland hurling final. Several townsfolk pass\nthrough the shop that evening, but all their lives are\nabout to be changed by the reappearance in the town\nof Danger Doyle...\nThe play examines the relationship of people who\ngrow up together in a town, and their attitude to those\nwho 'escape'. At times moving, at times funny, the\natmosphere is great, enhanced by the smallness of the\ntheatre.\nThe Bush Theatre, above the Bush Pub on\nShepherds Bush Green, would be straining to hold\nfeel as if you are actually in with the actors-but\nmakes you acutely aware of one of the play's main\nproblems: characters are often left on stage for long\nperiods of time, with nothing to do. They end up\nlurking on the sidelines, gazing vacuously into the\naudience, while other characters pour their hearts out\nto one another.\nOff stage action is handled well though, with\nenough references made to build up a feel for the town\nand its inhabitants outside. The acting is uniformly\ngood, although Danger Doyle does come across as\nrather more Dirty Den-esque than the words he was\nThe plot, although interesting, does tend to wander\na bit and the final conflict when all the characters\nfinally meet on stage is so cat as tropic it barely fits in\nwith what went before. One is left feeling not that\nconsequences of Danger Doyle's visit have not been\ndel t with, but that they are just beginning-almost as\nif the play had finished at the wrong place.\nPoor Beast in the Rain is on at the Bush Theatre,\nShepherds Bush Green, Tue-Sun at 8pm. A student\nticket costs \u00a34.00.\nAdam T. much more than a hundred people. This makes you saying seemed to indicate.\nThe sprouts of wrath\nBook\nBy Robert Rankin\nMany have tried, and all but a few have failed in\nproducing a book with both wit and content that is\nworthy of print. Sadly I feel this book fails to meet\nthese most demanding requirements. Don't get me\nwrong for as a light-hearted read, that passes through\nleaving no evidence of its passing, this books scores\nquite well. As for literary skill it can only be described\nas disappointing.\nBased in Brentford the story chronic als events\nfollowing the mysterious destruction of the Olympic\nStadium in Birmingham. In the quiet suburban town\nthe council is shocked into resignation when Jennifer\nNaylor proposes that they bid to host the games. Ms\nNaylor is a Mrs Thatcher clone without the stupid\nhaircut but with a large chest that she uses to good\neffect on the male members of the council.\nNow that might seem crazy and insane but the\nevents that follow are so unbelievable to be laughable.\nMysteriously a plan has already been made and with\nthe aid of a little of the green folding stuff, planning\npermission is obtained.\nThe stadium is to float five hundred feet above the\nground on five pillars. Floating is not exactly true for\nit is to be built out of 'Gravitite', a substance that\nappears to defy gravity (but even I know that's impossible, I think).\nFrom here to the end the story is of occult and\nPage 4\nmysterious forces (the stadium is in the shape of a pentacle) which emi nate from the ga so meter that\ndoes not belong to the Gas Board and has existed for\nover a thousand years.\nAs I said earlier I feel the book has failed in its goal\nbut it does have some funny moments, although it is\nnormally character actions that produce slight\nchuckles rather than any of the narrative.\nIn a book of this ilk it is often the case, and this is\nno exception, the characters are no more than names\nwith little or no development.\nNeville the part-time barman who has worked\nbehind the bar in the White Swan for twenty years\nis perhaps a slight exception. He believes, wrongly,\nthat the reason the paperboy throws the morning\npaper at the pub, landing in various places, is that he\nhad some sort of sexual trauma when he was\nyounger. Thus the idea of placing the paper through\nthe hole in the door brings back bad memories. Infact\nhe's just lazy.\nThe rest of the characters such as Jim Pody and\nJohn Omally, who have set up a smuggling and\npoaching business (the P and 0 Line) are typical in\ntheir lack of detail.\nIt is a fairly easy read, you can get through twenty\npages and not notice it, although perhaps that is a bad\nsign.\nSo overall if you want a humourous, light-hearted\nstory, one with little plot which does not tax your\nmind, then perhaps this is the book for you. In\nsummary I would class this book as one of the\nthousands of non-de script books that haunt the\nshelves of shops for years, not a classic, but passable.\nIan Hodge.\n50 FREE TICKETS\nSylvester Stallone in\n'LOCK UP'\nNational Press Preview\nOdeon Leicester Square\nSunday 26th November, 10.30am FELIX has a free ticket for the first 50\npeople to come into the Office today!\nThere are no catches\u2014this is a genuine\noffer.\n\n"

    "content": "A well reasoned letter\nDear Editor,\nI was interested to read the feature by Liz Warren\nin last week's edition of FELIX, but was sad to find\nthat apart from one exception (a reference to a report\npublished by Everywoman), it was based upon\nhearsay and unsound arguments. My response rs as\nfollows:\n1. The given definition of pornography was,\n'writing, pictures, films etc designed to stimulate\nsexual excitement', and NOT '...which stimulate...'\nas she tried to construe. It matters little whether the\ngroup gathered to write an article against pornography\nfound the pictures erotic or otherwise. If the rate at\nwhich the copies of FELIX disappeared last Friday is\nany indication then the rest of IC certainly disagrees\nwith them.\n2. In 'a word of warning' at the end of the article,\nit was said that soft porn could readily give access\nto 'hard core extremes'. This follows the old\nassumption that human personality is at root evil, and\nif we give it free reign, pornography will eventually\ngravitate into more and more violent forms. But this\nis demonstrably false. In countries such as the USA\nand Sweden, wh re the laws are much freer, the\npercentage of violent pornography has consistently\nremained small despite having few restrictions (see\nPorn Gold pub. Faber & Faber).\n3. Another contention is that pornography is\ndegrading to women. There are two sides to consider.\n(a) The models. Many articles have been written\non pornography which include interviews with the\nmodels themselves, a good example is that in the\nweekend Guardian of November 18 (see also Porn\nGold pub. Faber & Faber). None th tI have seen have\nshown them as degraded or demeaned. In any case\nit seems unlikely that anyone would be forced to\ndegrade themselves for a one off payment of about\n\u00a3200.\n(b) Women in General. Pornography is often\ncriticised for portraying a one-sided, and unreal picture\nof women. It shows them as sex-objects. This is\ncertainly true, but could not the same argument be\nused against the fasion industry's use of models? If\nwe see an image, say, of a woman reading the news,\ndo we condemn it for showing an image of a woman\nas a reading machine? Our society is full of images\nof women, and why an image of her as a sensual being\nshould not be included among them, I do not know.\nIf Liz can find a way of portraying women which is\nmore erotic to the majority of men, then I am sure that\nshe will soon become rich. What matters is the totality\nof images, not any particular one. In my opinion, the\nlow number of women MPs and company directors\nis a much more pressing problem.\n4. Let nobody misunderstand that rape is a most\nrepulsive crime of violence, which scars victims for\nlife. But there has, as Liz admits, been no evidence\nto show that exposure to pornography would make\na man more likely to commit rape. In fact most of the\nevidence points in the other direction. During the early\nseventies, when censorship was reduced, there was\nno increase in sex crime, which surely would have\nresulted if there was a link. Similar patters can be\nshown all across the world. The evidence that she\ndoes provide hints at links between pornography, and\na reduced sympathy for rape victims (among other\nthings). As I have not seen this report I cannot\ncomment on it, but can site a similar study which was\nd is uc s sed on the recent BBC production on images of\nrape in film. It did show the link as described, but not\nfor pornography such as Whitehouse and Rodox, but\nfor really violent video nas ties.5. I don't really know why a discussion of penis\nlength was included in an article on pornography, but\nsurely the simple way to deal with the advertisement\nshown is the same as for all advertisements which\nmake false claims and trade unfairly on our fears: refer\nit to the Advertising Standards Council.\n6. 'The Committee against Pornography and\nCensorship'. By all means, if pornography is shown\nto provide a negative load on society then we must\nban it. But do not let us kid ourselves into believing\nthat what we are doing is not censorship. We might\nas well call black white.\n7. A narrative text taken from the hard-core\nmagazine Rodox was shown as an example of how\npornography demonstrated a fantastic approach to\nsex, and it was commented that all pornography is\nfantasy. But of course it is. Nobody watches an\nedition of Dynasty to gain insights on real life, and\naccordingly nobody expects to find a portrayal of real\nsexuality in pornography. If we see Tom beating Jerry\nover the head with a heavy saucepan, it's hardly going\nto make us go and try it, ignorant of its real dangers.\nOur lives are full of fantasies, and would be a lot\npoorer without them.\n8. The suggested redefinition of pornography as,\n'anything which portrays human beings taking part in\nhumiliating, fantastic al or degrading activities,\nwhether sexual or otherwise', seems quite ridiculous\nto me. Not only would it exclude Penthouse as\nadmitted by the group, but would include Alice in\nWonderland, and documentaries on Nazi\nconcentration camps. Surely the word they are\nhunting for is obscene, and this certainly does not\ninclude most of the examples in the feature.\nOur censorship laws as they stand would forbid the\ndistribution of a video showing a woman giving birth\nto her child, as the sight of her vagina would be\nconsidered obscene. It also forbids the portrayal of\npenetration, both on film and paper. I fail to see what\nis so corrupting in this. By all means let us have laws\nto protect the vulnerable, and uphold what is right,\nbut our laws show more signs of being generated by\nAnglo-Saxon prudery than anything else. Something\nthat our European partners thankfully do not share.\nIf these images offend you, don't look at them.\nMatthew G Johnson.\nReasoned?\nDear Dave,\nI have read your 'Meat Market' article carefully.

I have been\ninformed that Miss Fox is currently trying to distance\nherself from unpopular Government policy in a bid to\nbecome President of the Union. I feel this will be very\nmuch an uphill struggle for her, as all the members\nof the Conservative Society that I have spoken to on\nthis issue, thought that Miss Fox was in favour of\nStudent Loans and the Community Charge before she\nwas elected Chairman.\nThe question that my first letter to FELIX posed was\n'Why did Miss Fox inform FELIX that she was\nresigning as Chairman of the Conservative Society for\npolitical reasons, when she was actually resigning for\npersonal reasons?'

    "content": "Muddy waters\nSir,\nWith reference to the debate over Ms Marsh I would\nlike to make a couple of comments as an ex-student\nof the department.\n1. The whole issue was caused by a trade union.\nOverall there was little net effect to students, but in\nthis case there was a great effect.\n2. We are a 'centre of excellence' and rightly or\nwrongly regarded as one of the best Science and\nTechnology colleges in the world. It seems silly for\npeople not to be able to use the knowledge and\nexpertise that the department has so painstakingly\nthrust down the students' throats by not letting them\ntake up placements in which they have an interest.\nTo not allow someone to take a placement because\nof a petty 'industrial dispute' borders on insanity.\n2. A paper is not any easier because three out of\neight questions were the same-it probably made it\nharder because who would bother to revise those\nquestions? Answer: Most departments recycle exam\nquestions anyway (the buggers are too lazy to set\ncompletely new ones) so it's always pot luck how\nmany old ones will turn up.\n4. I personally think Ms Marsh is pretty, although\nI don't agree with her politics. The amount of weight\nthat such arguments carry depends on individual\nexaminers and departments-some still refuse to have\na number identity system (like GCE) and the fact that\nyour name appears on the top of the paper leads to\nobvious bias in marking or the possibility of such bias\nat any rate. Somebody thinking the opposite to me\nmay come up with very different marks.\n5. Given the above arguments, it is the\ndepartment's fault, and greedy or misguided people\nin it if there is a subsequent problem. I feel that the\nfact that somebody wishes to go and do something\nuseful in Gambia, rather than work for a bloated multinational drug company, or some p oxy project\ninvolving a lecturer's best bum chum is far more\nworthy, and of infinitely more use to the planet and\ncivilisation than some greedy academic living in\ncomfort in the first world and polluting the planet.\nGood luck and well done to Ms Marsh, and I hope the\nwh in gers get run over by a bus.\nThe Life Sciences Division (it is made up of more\nthan one department) is unfair, but so is life. I am\nprepared to be called as a material witness on both\nissues.\nYours,\nTony Spencer.\nPS. 'Name withheld by request' still had some good\npoints to make. Let's kick ass!\nFelix=porn?\nDave,\nRe. your article on pornography:\nThe text itself was well balanced and made a lot\nof very good points-with all the best intentions.\nBut, I think that, within the FELIX Office, there\nexists many of the people that this article was meant\nto offend (the 'f under s of the industry'). I come to this\nconclusion because of the sick nature of the FELIX\ncover and the pictures accompanying the article. They\ngreatly offended me and many other people that I have\nspoken to -and I consider them to be an unnecessary\npart of the article-which degenerated itself into a piece of pornographic sensationalism.\nYours sincerely,\nJim Watson (Bee Eng V PS. The warning given on the cover is a little too\nlate-don't you think?\nBlinkered?\nDear Dave,\nI would like to thank FELIX and particularly Liz\nWarren for the most interesting and thought-provoking article it has published this term. However,\nI feel it expressed a somewhat blinkered point of view.\nIt seems to be based on the assumptions that\nwomen do not read the soft core magazines aimed at\nmen, nor do they look at Playgirl unless they are the\nsort of woman who 'When walking down the street\nminding their own business are in fact simply waiting\nfor a man to leap on them and drag them away for\nsex'. What is the evidence for the assertion that many\nof the women who buy from 'tupperware' style sex-aid parties would find harder pornography offensive?\nI have been amused, and, yes, even had my sexual\nexcitement stimulated by men's magazines such as\nMayfair and Knave (although I have never read\nPlaygirl), 'blue' films and even the Sunday Sport. Yet\nI consider myself to be a normal female with a healthy\nheterosexual appetite. Perhaps your discussion group\nwas not sufficiently representative?\nName wit held by request.\nDark glasses?\nDear FELIX,\nIf you take away a blind man's cane, he finds\nanother. If you 'shock' a blind man into dropping his\ncane, he stumbles on for a few steps, and then starts\nlooking for the cane again.\nIt is good to see FELIX raising such emotive issues\nas pornography, but what did you hope to achieve in\nmaking people feel 'disgusted'? Why supply hundreds\nof IC students with pictures to drool over, or be\noffended by? True you wanted to disgust some away\nfrom pornography, but realistically they are only likely\nto 'give up' for a short while, before 'giving in' to\nwithdrawal needs. Either they will have to harden\nthemselves against the criticism of pornography, or\nlearn to live with an inner guilt of its emptiness.\nAs Christians, we believe that all people are\nprecious, and loved by God. We were made in the\nimage of God, a loving God, but by our actions we\nreject Him, and His gift Jesus Christ, who shows us\nthe fullness of God's love. So we feel an emptiness\nin our lives, which we fill with many things, including\nmisuse of sexual pleasures. God wants to fill this\nemptiness with love.\nGod has given us the gift of sexuality, designed for\nloving relationships. Intimate sexuality being reserved\nfor a relationship with special stability and\ncommitment; marriage.\nPornography is superficial, going deeper we find\nthat people are exchanging truth for a lie, people are\nsubstituting sex in place of love. No one can live\nwithout being loved, and people are looking in very\nmany places to find love, or its nearest available\napparent equivalent.\n'But God demonstrates his love in this, while we\nwere still sinners, Christ died for us.'

They seem to have a lack of knowledge\nconcerning the Cyprus issue, however, they can be\nforgiven as most of them would not remember the\nformation of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960 as a partnership between the Turkish and the Greek\nCypriots, its downfall in 1963 with the Greek-Greek\nCypriot armed onslaught against the Turkish Cypriot\npopulation when thousands of Turks were killed and\nmany thousands rendered homeless in the name of\nEnosis, union of Cyprus with Greece, and the\noppression and suffering of the Turkish Cypriots until\n1974 when Turkey as a Guarantor intervened to stop\nthe extermination of the remaining Turks on the island.\nThe Greek Cypriots who caused the problems in\nCyprus by wanting union with Greece, and denied the\nright of the Turkish Cypriots to life, liberty and security\nof person which undoubtedly constitutes the most\nfundamental right of any human being are now\ncomplaining about violations of human rights and\ntrying to cover up their past. It must not be forgotten\nthat more than half the Turkish Cypriot population are\nalso refugees having left their homes and land in the\nSouth, however, can now live in peace in the Turkish\nRepublic of Northen Cyprus with the knowledge that\nthey are at last safe from the Greek tyranny.\nYours sincerely,\nAGOTS.\nHabib Umur.\nKenan Yuce Sanliturk.\nNo more!\nDear Dave,\nSurprise, surprise, the wing eing idiot anon writes\nyet another very silly letter.

    "content": "Back to the future II\nAt the end of 1985's block busting hit Back to the\nFuture, the time travelling Delorean (so much more\nclassy than an old police box) crashed back into Marty\nMcFly's garden. The Doc lept out and said to Marty'It's your kids, something's got to be done about your\nkids!'. BTTFII picks up the plot from here, with the\nDelorean making the jump to 2015, but with someone\nwatching...30 years later this same person sees the\nsame Deloreon and an implausible young Doc Brown\nand starts to put two and two together.\nDirector Robert Zemeckis has reassembled the\nmajority of the cast members from the first film. Once\nagain they get to play their characters at different\nstages in their lives (1955/1985 and 2015) in\nsurprisingly good make-up. Two of the cast actually\nget to play different members of the same family-Michael J Fox as Marty, and his son and daughter (!)\n(!), and Thomas Wilson as Biff and Geoff Tannen. The\nfuture handily allows Doc Brown to be rejuvenated\nthus letting Christopher Lloyd avoid playing most of\nthe film under heavy ageing make-up.\nThe jumping makes for a complex plot, but one that\nis reasonably easy to follow-especially as the Doc\ndraws a diagram to explain it all! The jaunt to the\nfuture is a fairly light-hearted affair with a fair amount\nof jokes dependant on comparisons with our\nA siren sounds. Six people in varo us stages of undress\nburst onto the stage. They walk round and round the\nstage in silence, the two of them dress for dinner.\nThe Origin of Table Manners deals with the\nabsurdities of our social behaviour. As a liner, on its\nmaiden voyage, heads for destruction, its passengers\ncontinue the bizarre social dance, that forbids any\nbreach of normality or devi an cy. The cast of seven perform a very stylised play,\nmixing music, movement, commonplace props, and\neven speech (occasionally) to try and provide us with\na dark comedy of manners.\nSome of their targets are easily identifiable-the\nrigid restrictions on eating habits, and the 'romantic\ndinner', and the social interplay of men and women.\nOther messages are obscured by the surrealistic\nmethod by which they are presented. Much of the\ncomedy is slapstick, and very funny, but you are\npresent-an advert for Jaws 14 ('This time it's personal'), a Cafe 80 nostalgia cafe and a virtual\nrepeat of the skateboard chase scene from the first\nmovie-with one vital difference.\nWhen the travellers return to 1985 things take on\na much darker tone, as they find themselves in a bleak\nand violent alternative time line, when California is\ncontrolled by Biff, Marty's arch-enemy, and his family\nlife has taken a horrific new twist.\nIn an attempt to put this right they travel back to\nthe same day in 1955 that Marty left in the previous\nfilm, and to another visit to the 'Enchantment under\nthe sea' dance. Now, though, the Doc and Marty have\nto avoid their earlier selves! Humour reasserts its grip\nas Marty de spar at ely tries to get his hands on a certain\nobject.\nThe film is a worthy sequel to its predecessor,\nmanaging to develop the basic idea given there, while\nalso being much funnier. You could never accuse it\nof being an intellectually challenging film-but who\ncares? It makes for a great evening's entertainment\u2014\nlaughs, drama, action\u2014what more do you need?\nIt also leads directly into BTTF-Partlll, which was\nfilmed back to back with this, and is due in Summer\n1990. A Delorean in the Wild West? I can't wait!\nAdam T. always confused as to exactly what it's there for.\nVirtually everything that happens seems to be\nsymbolic of something-the problem is that you are\nnever quite sure of what. When you lose sight of what\nthe actors are trying to tell you, their actions seem\nonly ridiculous.\nAs the play draws to a close the atmosphere grows\ndarker, as they face death and come to terms with\nthe ghosts that haunt their past.\nTo be honest, the play left me bemused but\nthoughtful. If you enjoy challenging plays that will\nkeep you thinking for days after, this is for you. If\nyou're looking for an evening's entertainment-forget\nit.\nThe Origin of Table Manners is on at the ICA, The\nMall, SW1 until Dec 1. A concessionary ticket costs\n\u00a34.60.\nAdam T. Theatre\nA winter tan\nA Winter Tan is based upon the letters written by\nMaryse Holder on Holiday in Mexico. It follows her\nunabashed quest for sexual gratification through the\nnight clubs of Acapulco. Her encounters are relayed\nas frank confessions to camera, and while revelling\nin them, she is resentful at being tethered to her base\ncompulsion. Eventually her exploits lead her into an\naffair with whose growing emotional involvement she\nis unable to cope, and she rebounds into another bout\nof promiscuity.\nMaryse as a character is both sensual and\nintelligent, yet is w racked by fear of her ageing body,\nand its fading ability to attract the Adonises that she\nso desires. Although in her behaviour, she is largely\nun constrained by existing roles, she struggles to\ndiscover her own identity. Like many other women\nwho seek liberation, she is caught in the gulf between\ntraditional values and newer ideologies; the term 'slut'\nmakes her recoil in anguish. Nevertheless she cannot\nreconcile the forthright independence of feminism and\nher pathetic dependence on men, and is left drowning\nin her own angst. It is interesting to note that had the\nsexes been reversed, we would probably have\naccused this film of being crude and exploitative. As\nit is, the clear victim is Maryse herself.\nJackie Burrough's performance as Maryse Holder\nis highly convincing, and is clearly the work of a talented actress. The cinematography is generally of\na good standard, although it does betray signs of the\ndocumentary background of some of the team of\ndirectors. Whether this democratic approach to filmmaking will prove productive remains to be seen, but\nthis certainly does not discourage it.\nA Winter Tan is both bold and incisive. It grabs its\nsubject matter by the throat and refuses to let go.\nHowever, the film is lacking in content, and tends to\nrepeat itself. It cannot be criticised for its lack of\nanswers, for that is not necessarily the role of cinema.\nBut the questions that it poses have all been asked\nbefore, and that unfortunately is its one weakness.\nMatthew G Johnson.\nTheatre\nThe origin of table manners\nPage 3\n\n"

If you want to try\nsomething different that\ndoesn't cost too much,\nwhy not try something\nbizarre, something reeking\nwith history and horror film\ngothic, something so romantic it is hard to believe it\nwasn't built as a self parody.\nWhen I visited this cemetary last, the guide who\ntook our small group was a rather eccentric-looking\nAustralian, dressed all in black. He put up his\numbrella-black, of course-as it started to drizzle\noutside the entrance chapel.\n: r% \u00a7 ? i* 'Right', he said, 'Shall we go?', and he strode off,\nacross the cobble stoned courtyard towards the brick\ncolonnade opposite. We trotted after, zipping up\njackets and opening umbrellas, and followed him up\nsome wide stone steps leading up from under the\ncolonnade. At the top we were treated to a dramatic\nfirst view of the wild and dingy foliage delineating a stony path leading deep into what looked like\nintractable forest.\nMarble crosses and angels green with age peered\nout from the ivy and sycamore trees.\nNeil, the photographer, and a student at Imperial,\nmuttered darkly about drizzle ruining his lenses and\nhid the camera inside his jacket.\nThe guide chattered happily to his congregation\nabout irrelevant details of the graves, whilst we\nhovered behind hoping to get a person-free picture of\nthe graveyard.\nThe murky path led to a grandly romantic gateway,\na massive arch leading into darkness flanked by\nEgyptian columns and trailing ivy. Inside was a corridor lined with rusty iron doors and roofed by\ndense vegetation.\n'This is the Egyptian Avenue', said the guide, 'The\nentrance to a necropolis. Peter Cushing has been\nfilmed here complete with dry ice mist and red lined\ncape'.\nThe avenue led to a ring of doors in a sunken moat-like affair.\n'These doors have got holes in them because\ndecaying bodies produce a lot of gas', he said. 'A number of nasty explosions have occurred when\npeople wanted to forget this unpleasant fact.'\nUp a flight of steps out of the moat, which was seen\nto encircle an enormous cedar. 'I gather that during\nthe last century they played A Midsummer Night's' A very romantic gesture. However, a few years later,\nher husband had financial difficulties so ordered the\nbody to be exhumed and took the book to the\npublishers.'\nOn the other side of the road, the other half of the\ncemetary contains the grave of Karl Marx. This is\nworth a visit if only to enjoy the strange experience\nof feeling that his grave monument has outlasted his\nphilosophy. I expected the bust of Marx, in red granite\nand bronze, to be cracked and decrepit. It wasn't it\nstill proudly proclaimed:\nKarl Marx, 5 May 1818-14 March 1883\nPhilosophers have only\ninterpreted the world in\nvarious ways. The point\nhowever is to change it.\nThe epitaph doesn't scan very well, not to mention\nthe rather painful irony it now contains. The 'Marx\nDream there. Very atmospheric, no doubt.'\nOverlooking us was an enormous white\nmausoleum, built in a very exotic eastern style, behind\nwhich was a Victorian brick church set on a high\nterrace, just an imposing grey shadow through the\ndrizzle.\n'There were anti-aircraft guns on that terrace during\nthe war,' he said.\nAt about this point I started to get intensely irritated\nby being guided, as I much prefer my own random\nwandering-l think you see more that way. Anyhow,\nthe guide did insist on shepherding his flock.\nHe pointed out the Rossetti grave near a less\novergrown part of the cemetary reminiscent of a country churchyard.\n'She was buried with her long gold hair wrapped\naround a book of unpublished poems,' he said lyrically.\nCat'-a fat ginger stray cat lives around here, living\noff the goodwill of the cemetary keepers and the\nscraps of the many visitors. In this way it manages\nquite well without doing any work at all. Analogies\nseem to breed in this place.\nHighgate Cemetary is a nature reserve as well as\na trip into the past. It ceased to function as a graveyard shortly after the Second World War and has\nbeen left virtually unattended for nearly fifty years.\nIt is suffocating ly atmospheric and is one of my\nfavourite places in London. The nearest tube station\nis Archway, you have to walk a bit, across Waterlow\nPark. A longer but much more pleasant route is from\nHampstead tube, taking a stroll over Hampstead\nHeath where John Constable painted many of his\nlandscapes which are now in the V&A Museum. The\nentrance charge to the cemetary is \u00a32.00.\n\n"

    "content": "The dark side of job hunting\nWhat a jungle the whole recruitment process turns out\nto be for us final year s tudes. The fact that there is\na real shortage of graduates available, does not seem\nto make our job of choosing a career any less time\nconsuming or bewildering. Few of us are complaining\nabout this glut of opportunities; the staggering number\nof companies vying for our attention does no end of\ngood for the ego. There is much talk among us of\nwhether to choose a job which is rewarding, fulfilling\netc, but 'only' pays 11,000 big ones, or to go for the\n'boring, but financially rewarding career choice'.\nDecisions! Decisions! It's tough being a prospective\ngraduate job hunter I don't think.\nAs if the notorious IC workload and the prospect\nof finals looming weren't enough to get our\nworkaholic (well, you have to be if you're at IC) spirits\ninto top gear, we are bombarded with information and\nopportunities in every direction. If you are smart\nenough to navigate your way through the maze of\ncareers talks, seminars, Christmas vacation work\nexperience courses, Careers Library handouts,\ncompany 'glossies', fairs and the like, and survive\nunscathed, then all those forthcoming interviews and\naptitude tests should be a breeze.\nSpeaking of Careers Fairs, wasn't it awfully difficult\nto try and find ot exactly what jobs some of these\ncompany employees actually do? Probably easier\ngetting blood from a stone, because these people\nwent into hyper-bullshit mode and subjected us to a barrage of flowery company prose about 'challenging\nopportunities', 'problems analysis', and 'testing your\nresources'. All we wanted to know was what they\nby Parvez AH (Aero III)\nactually got up to in a working day, apart from being\nfussed and fett ed over by their graduate hungry\nemployers. If any of them quoted any figures for their\nsalaries, it would be wise of apply an exaggeration\nfactor of about 10%.\nThe whole concept of the Careers Fair has a sordid\nand sinister nature about it. Can we honestly be\nexpected to absorb a feel for the working\nenvironment, company culture and fulfillment by\nwading through the pages of glossy brochures and\nlending our ears to the carefully chosen phrases of\ncarefully chosen company representatives?\nHaving mentioned fulfillment, it comes perilously\nclose to di cussing the meaning of life, a subject far\ntoo arty for an average IC student to digest. Anyway,\nmost students when in a brutally honest mood, will\nhappily admit that they do not really care for a career\neven it it's challenging, testing, fulfilling and all those\nother qualities that are supposedly attractive. How\nmuch better, they admit, it would be if they could flit\nfrom job to job, have lots of leisure time, and still get\ngood financial rewards, i.e. the 'perfect' job. The\nproblem is, that many of us would-be rat racers\nactually believe that this is exactly what their degree\ncertificate offers them.\nThe point of it ail seems to be that a degree makes\nworking life more bearable than the average workers'\njob; not the most persuasive argument for slogging\naway like we do. But then, you wouldn't be at IC if\na cushy, easy time was what you were looking for,\nright.\nGet drunk painlessly and raise money for IC Rag.\nSouthside vodka promo\nFor the past three years Herburt Heybowicz, a Polish\nfirm, have been producing a vodka using a revolutionary new process. This produces a vodka\nwhich has all the traditional 'Polish' features, i.e. the\nburn, but one startling difference, it has negligible\ndetectable a co hol content.\nDistilled and refined in a similar way to the other\nfamous Polish vodka's, Wyborawa, and Zamoyski, it\nthen undergoes a patented chemical process to\nremove, or at least dissipate the alcohol. The final\nproduct is then bottled and sold in the normal way.\nThe vodka, which by the way is pronounced 'push-nosh-chay', will be marketed nationally in this country\nin April of next year. However, due to links established\nthrough through various European societies with\nWarsaw University in the past year, we have been\nsent six bottles as a gift. These six bottles will be put\non sale in Southside Bar today, between 6 and 9pm and will be available at these times until they run out,\nor until the following Friday, the 31st. As they were\na gift, it has been agreed with the company that any\nrevenue resulting from their sale, will be donated to\ncharity, i.e. Rag.\nCome and feel the burn, and your legs afterwards!\nIn Southside tonight, try the new painless\nScrewdriver.\nPOJXOZCE\n:POLSIC\\\n75CL War za w Small Ads ADVERTISE IN THE FELIX SMALL ADS SECTION\nFREE IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION\nANNOUNCMENTS\n\u2022 Keep-Fit Club: Anyone wishing to join should\ncome to Southside Gym during a lesson.
