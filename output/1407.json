Soulless? Formulaic? Don\u2019t bet on it. Despite appearances, Pizza Express has been an avid supporter of the UK jazz scene in many of its\nlarger restaurants and as a taster or a happy compromise with your other half, it\u2019s hard to beat\nthe relaxing surroundings of this small club. All the essential ingredients are there \u2013 soft lighting,\ngreat acoustics, an intimate atmosphere and a terrific line-up of acts. The music definitely leans\ntowards the vocal, but that\u2019s no bad thing. Forget the jazz nazis and enjoy the friendly atmosphere\nand music with a favourite pizza dish.\nRonnie Scott\u2019s\nYes, it\u2019s a tourist trap and yes, there are plenty of posers to be found, but this Soho institution didn\u2019t become one for no reason. Once you\u2019ve booked ahead and paid the cover\ncharge, shrugged off the pricey drinks and settled down, you are treated to some of the\nworld\u2019s greatest jazz and soul acts. With an almost-unrivalled star power, the venue has\nsome of the best live music in town \u2013 no amateurish efforts, no bum notes, just slick,\npassionate and seasoned players playing the life out of their instruments for your aural\ndelectation. Scheduled for the coming weeks are excellent jazz guitarist Martin Taylor,\nPharoah Sanders, Larry Coryell, Kenny Garrett and Steve Howe. Even if you haven\u2019t had\nthe time to keep up with the scene or become acquainted with some of the acts, more\nthan likely the show on any given night will be more than enough to blow you away.\nRecommended.\nThe Great Culture Crawl\nChapter Thirteen \u2013 Jazz clubs, nice\nLe Quecum Bar\nFor those who like their jazz with a little more attitude, this little bar/brasserie on the Battersea High Street is the\nperfect antidote to the multitude of banal \u201csmooth jazz\u201d (read: background music) currently swamping the market.\nInspired by the sounds of the Left Bank and the heyday of the Hot Club of Paris, the main draw here is the gypsy\njazz and live jams held virtually every night of the week.\nGypsy jazz is a style that was made famous in 1920\u2019s Paris, in particular by the energetic Quintette du Hot Club\nde France, fronted by the prodigally gifted guitarist Django Reinhardt and equally talented violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli. Characterised by tantalisingly energetic guitar and violin melodies and improv over a driving and shuffling\nrhythm guitar section, this style is ideal for aspiring jazzers wishing to expand their horizons beyond bop. The bar\nserves light brasserie-style food and has an extensive wine list, and despite the nostalgic references to said Parisian\ninstitution, the star of the show is the music.\n\n"

Voting to affiliate by 53% to 47% hardly represents\na ringing endorsement for the NUS\nfrom Imperial students and throughout this year I have attended countless\nevents to attempt to make the NUS\nbetter. My own perspective on this was\nthat I was \u201ctaking one for the team\u201d. I\nwould be the last student from Imperial ever to have to sit through some\ntortuous meetings where everything\nhas to be dumbed down to the point\nwhere any meaningful debate is not\npossible. I took the view that this was\nworth the effort as if the NUS changed\nthen it might have stood a reasonable\nchance of becoming a respected national voice for students.\nLooking ahead for the foreseeable\nfuture NUS will continue to operate\nin a farcical manner. I could take an\nidealistic stance and raise the notion\nof some sort of consensus could be\nreached if only we hung around for\nanother year. The reality is that those\npolitical activists with a vested interest in how the NUS operates have no\nintention of changing their position\nand I feel that this would be a naive\nstance to take. For the avoidance of\ndoubt, these are the same people who\ncontinuously attempt to waste everyone\u2019s time on pointless debates about\nesoteric issues in far off lands.\nI would love to sit some of them\ndown and talk about pressing issues\nsuch as assessment feedback and student housing but whilst they are more\ninterested in ranting on about what a\ngreat job Hugo Chavez is doing running Venezuela and why students\nshould go on strike for no reason attempts to do so are futile.\nIt is quite right that there are now a\nlot of people questioning the legitimacy of NUS. Indeed, over the Christmas\nholidays I was forwarded an email that\nhad been sent by the Chief Executive\nof Universities UK to the College advertising the Student Juries scheme\nwhich is being run by the government\nvia the Department for Innovation,\nUniversities and Skills. The NUS will\ntell you that they are the only show\nin town when it comes to talking to\nthe government and that they are respected as the authoritative voice of\nUK students. It saddened me to read\nthe following excerpt\n\u201cUUK has been working to raise\nissues of concern over this agenda\nthrough our position on the stakeholders working group and are particularly keen that the students selected\nto take part in the juries should be\nrepresentative of the full range of student voices. We have argued that care\nshould be taken not to include merely\n\"politicised voices\" through organisations such as the NUS.\u201d\nIs an organisation that is dismissed\nby the umbrella body for all UK Universities as unrepresentative and dominated by voices that are needlessly\npoliticised really something that we\nwant to subsidise? Both these statements are inferred by the above text\nwhich raises serious questions about\nthe NUS as the marvellous student\nvoice that they claim to be. \u00a346,000 is\na lot of money to pay for an organisation which is treated with such dis-dain. NUS\u2019 2008/09 budget indicates\nthat they are spending \u00a3502,073 on\ntaking decisions which is \u00a3200,000\nmore than what they intend to spend\non campaigning and advocacy. That\u2019s\nright folks, the NUS thinks it is better to spend huge amounts of money\non political events where officers can\nwhinge at each other than it does\nspending the money on delivering outcomes for students. This represents a\nchronic waste of cash that I would like\nto see spent on what ordinary students\nwant.\nJust because we can afford NUS affiliation that doesn\u2019t make it a good\nuse of funds. I can afford the latest\nGirls Aloud CD but it doesn\u2019t follow\nthat I would be wise to spend some of\nmy money on it.\nIn October this Union supported\nNUS reform on the condition that this\nyear was the last year of waste and\nfarce. We stipulated back in November that if things didn\u2019t change then\nwe would re-consider our member-ship. This is an uncontested fact and\nbeing aware of the amount of effort\nthis Union has dedicated to changing\nNUS this year. I find the accusation\nmade that disaffiliation would represent a reactionary step not compatible\nwith this Union\u2019s work over the past\n12 months. I am now of the view that\nthe NUS is now well past saving and\nattempting to do so will just be a waste\nof our time and money. Next week,\nvote No to NUS affiliation is you want\nto send the strongest of messages\nthat Imperial College Union thinks\nthat students deserve better and that\n\u00a346,000 could be better spent.\nvote online imperialc\nIt is very important that you vote in this referendum, read the views and opinion\ndiscussion and then vote online from 00:01Tues 17 June until 23:59 Mon 23 Ju\n\n"

My favourite artists are Salvador Dali and Andy Grey, whose an\namazing psychedelic artist, full of colour.\u201d\nBen, Photography Student\n\u201cArt is unique, subjective. Independent in each viewer\u2019s eye. Favourites are\nJean Michel Basquait and Warhol: repetitive art in its own unique style.\u201d\nKrisi, Interior Design Student\n\u201cBanksy is my favourite artist, as he is an artist who produces pieces which\neveryone can relate to. I particularly like the controversy that some of his\npieces create and the way that his work does not necessarily fit into the\ndictionary definition of art.\u201d Nikhil, Civ Eng\nArt is one person\u2019s perception of the world that surrounds them.\nCavemen drew bison because their world was all about surviving;\nthe Pre-Raphelites saw beauty all around them and put it on\ncanvas.

His\npaintings are regal, full of attitude and very technical. My flatmate\nand I agreed that Velazquez was good at doing water which is very\nhard to do. It may sound cliched but I\u2019m a huge fan of Leonardo\nda Vinci. He was a \u2018Jack of all Trades\u2019 and a very forward thinker.\nI would love to have met him \u2013 I bet he was really eccentric and\nquirky, just like your average artist/scientist/inventor.\nRosie, Chemistry\n\u201cArt is something that causes a reaction or makes you feel something.

I guess art is any form of decorative\nor illustrative media if i\u2019m going to avoid lengthy hand-wavy definitions.\nI\u2019m not sure i know any specific artists well enough to be able to name a\nfavourite.

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFriday 13 June 2008 felix\nComment\n\u201cA\ns a product of Imperial College and a\nmember of its Court,\nI have never doubted\neither its strength or\nexcellence. The Court attracts brilliant\nstudents and its academic work is second to none. That\u2019s why NUS benefits\nfrom ICU membership. But 25 years\nas a journalist and in government have\ntaught me that the best are stronger\nwhen they work with the rest. The reality is that governments of all colours\npay attention to NUS; and unless ICU\nhas a place in the national union, its\nstudents are, in effect, voiceless. We\ncan all argue about how best to make\nthe case for student finance, improved\nhousing, higher standards of teaching;\nbut that\u2019s a debate that ICU students\ncan only have if they are inside NUS.\nIn essence, NUS needs ICU; but ICU\nalso needs NUS. Anything less and you\nshort-change yourselves.\u201d\nThese are the words of Trevor Phillips, but they also reflect my own\nthoughts as ICU embarks on a referendum on affiliation to the National\nUnion of Students (NUS). As the new\nPresident of NUS, I can only implore\nyou to vote no to this attempt to disaf-filiate from NUS so you remain part of\nthe national debate on issues that affect you today and will have an impact\non students for generations to come.\nWith the new higher education fund-ingpolicypassedatourAnnualConfer-ence in April, NUS has taken the initiative and we are challenging all political\nparties and stakeholders in higher education to come up with radical ideas\nand solutions to the current funding\ncrisis. I know ICU doesn\u2019t agree with\nevery aspect, but it ultimately means\nthat NUS isn\u2019t a broken record just\ncalling for free education. Instead we\nbecome a realistic and respected voice\nat the national table, shaping a fairer\nand easier system of fees and support.\nThat is something that I\u2019m sure all students will be glad their national union\nis doing.\nNUS makes an impact. We have won\ncouncil tax exemption for students,\ndoubled the disabled students allow-ance, reined in unscrupulous landlords\nwith a new national tenancy deposit\nscheme, and run a successful campaign\nto convince HSBC to back down over\ntheir plans to end interest-free student\noverdrafts. This alone saved students\nan estimated \u00a322 million.\nNUS needs to change and ICU has\nbeen an unwavering supporter of NUS\nreform. With you we have already restructured internally, bringing in new\nmanagement and making \u00a3300,000 in\nsavings as well as putting an end to\nsuccessive years of financial deficit. It\nhasn\u2019t been easy, but the organisation\nhas come out leaner and, with a new\nthree-year strategic plan, much more\nfocused on the core issues of defending and extending students\u2019 rights and\ndeveloping and championing strong\nstudents\u2019 unions.\nThe next step is to pass the reforms\nneeded to make these changes perma-nent. The Annual Conference this year\nnarrowly missed the two-thirds majority needed. But reform has not failed \u2013\nits just stalled. Nor is it time to throw\nin the towel and admit defeat. NUS will\nchange and it will do so soon. But let\u2019s\nbe clear, if ICU disaffiliates, the people\ncelebrating loudest will be those that\nbenefit from our broken structures.\nNow is the time to hold fast and see\nthis change through to the end.\nICU also benefits greatly from NUS\nin more than just national representation and campaigning. NUS trains your\nelected officers, develops networks to\npromote best practice between our 600\nmembers with ICU President Stephen\nBrown attending a residential with other presidents from across London and\nthe South, and provides expertise on\nissues such as the major legal changes\ncurrently affecting students\u2019 unions.\nNUS produces weekly briefings on\neducation issues which support your\nsabbaticals to represent you. Recent\ntopics have included the taught postgraduate experience, feedback on\nassessments and league tables. Furthermore NUS is provided the central\ninformation for when students need\nto register with the charities commis-sion, and getting legal advice on issues\nsuch as the employment status of sabbaticals and the pension scheme for\nour union staff \u2013 legal advice on this\nalone cost another London union over\n\u00a3100,000 when they sought it alone. All\nthis information is cheaper by sharing\nresources with other unions through\nthe NUS. NUS saves you money.\nEarlier this year, Bill Rammell, the\nMinister for DIUS, attended a debate\nat a campus, and a student asked him\nabout the point of NUS.\n\u201cWhat I can say,\u201d he explained, \u201cis\nthat if NUS didn\u2019t exist, the lives of\npoliticians would be whole lot easier.\u201d\nWe know NUS is not perfect. Representing the diversity of seven million\nstudents across the UK is an enormous\nchallenge. But if you really want the\nstudent voice to be heard nationally,\nthen we must not become divided. Say\nno to this attempt to leave NUS.\nWes Streeting\nNUS President\nwould vote Yes\nNUS makes an impact\nwould vote No\nChris Mullan\nKCLSU President\nelect\nLeave this ridiculous organisation\nA\nny discussion about the\nNUS can quickly and easily descend into obscurity and opacity for the\nwider spectator as those\nunfamiliar with the sphere can quickly be baffled as the premises taken as\nread broaden and multiply. So lets get\nclear a few things that otherwise might\nbe forgotten or left un-elucidated. The\nprimary role of any Union is to represent its members interests. Your Union, Imperial College Union, works to\nimprove the educational experience\nfor all students at Imperial college. The\nNUS was founded to give all students\nin education representation nationally,\nso in essence this whole debate, despite\nwhat you may hear, comes down to rep-resentation. Representation is about\ndelivering a message to those that can\nmake the decisions, and making sure\nthat the decision taken is in line with\nthose you represent. In order to be effective at this, the representative must\nbe taken seriously, something the NUS\ncurrently has problems with.\nRather than welcoming Imperial in to\nNUS membership, and the substantial\nnew funds it allowed, for petty-politi-cal reasons, a plethora of fairly extreme\npeople to slag off ICU, it\u2019s members\nand it\u2019s beliefs, instead of championing their return to the embrace of\nmembership. They figured it was more\nworthwhile for their own ends to let\nICU students to be universally labelled\nas villains who eat puppies for breakfast rather than for standing up and\nwelcoming the fact that they chose to\ncome to the table to discuss NUS re-form. Even the self-styled \u201cmoderate\u201d\nleadership of NUS are still of the mindset that the very existence of excellent\nUniversities like Imperial College undermines the more recent additions to\nthe University sector. They constantly\nargue for money to be taken away from\nplaces like Imperial and spent in line\nwith their own highly subjective definition of what is \u201cfair\u201d in line with the\ntired dogma and rhetoric that they have\nbeen mulling over since the late 70\u2019s.\nThey seemed to want to disown you\npolitically while keeping your money\nall for the sake of maintaining a false\nsense of \u201cunity\u201d amongst the competing socialist sects that currently operate in and lead NUS.\nThe NUS also claims to hold a monopoly on all non-local representation,\na fact which is completely untrue. One\nof the \u2018triumphs\u2019 of NUS so proudly\ndisplayed is the U-turn by HSBC with\nrespect to their graduate accounts.\nBut to say that the NUS led on this is\nlike saying you or I runs their favourite football team by joining in with the\ncrowd and screaming words of encouragement at the players. The HSBC\ndemonstration was organised and led\nindependently of the NUS, and by and\nlarge was a result of facebook, word of\nmouth, and national press attention.\nWe see time and time again that nothing gets things done better than when\na small group of organised people get\ntogether to try and get change, be it\nin the form of the HSBC groups that\ncame together in agreement over that\nissue, and then dissolved when a solution was found, or London medical\nstudent groups getting together to run\ntheir own protests about changes in\ntheir housing situation whilst working\nfor the NHS.\nWithbreathtakingarrogancetheNUS\nwill offer you the false choice between\nNUS membership and being completely disconnected from the wider world.\nNext year when I take up my post of\nPresident of KCLSU I would be failing\nin my duty if I childishly refused to work\nwith Imperial or any other Union that\nhas seen sense and left NUS. It should\nnot be membership of a club that unites\nUnions. All Unions have a duty to work\ntogether when an area of common concern affects students at different insti-tutions. This can quite easily be done\noutside of NUS. ICU doesn\u2019t need the\nNUS in order to pick up the phone and\ntalk to other sabbaticals about working\ntogether on shared goals.\nWhy pay \u00a346000 when large groups\nof NUS delegates will not even listen\nto ICU delegate simply because they\nare from Imperial? Why pay someone\nelse to talk to your local MP when you\nalready have your own full-time sab-baticals? Why pay so much money to\nan organisation that NUS PresidentElect Wes Streeting has called broken,\nancient, and unrepresentative?\nThe NUS is a nice idea in theory\nbut in practice their working practices\nmake it very difficult for sabbaticals\nlike the ones at Imperial to get involved\nas they generally would rather spend\ntheir time doing their jobs than playing\nNUS politics. ICU gave NUS a chance\nand despite their spin NUS have in reality been an organisation that doesn\u2019t\ndeliver, doesn\u2019t represent, and happily\nslanders the students of Imperial College when it suits. Stop wasting both\nyour time and money and vote to leave\nthis ridiculous organisation.\nollegeunion.org/vote\nns of both sides of the\nn.\n\n"

Young asylum-seekers have it worse. Laura Starr puts exam stress in perspective\nNot the sort of asylum they were looking for. But it might beat what we provide to lone refugee children\nU\npon arrival she was only\n16 years old. Her mother\nhad passed away as a result of a neurological dis-order, she doesn\u2019t know\nwho her real father is and after a decade\nof cruel detention in her home country\nof Burundi there was only one option \u2013\nto escape, and escape she did.\nLana is not alone: there are an estimated 5,500 lone asylum refugees\nresiding here in the United Kingdom\n\u2013 their destination in a quest for protection and shelter from danger. However, upon arrival in the country she\nfelt extremely lonely, shocked and con-fused, while suffering from a number\nof health problems and unable to access the help she needed. This is not\nunusual.\nFor the first time, British scientists\nhave conducted an investigation comparing the post-war experiences of lone\nasylum-seeking children with those\nthat had been accompanied \u2013 their\nresults having recently been published\nin the Journal of Child Psychology and\nPsychiatry.\nDr Matthew Hodes, lead author of\nthe study from the Division of Neuroscience and Mental Health at Imperial\nCollege London, explained how the\nwork was \u201calso the first to clearly relate\nthe associated psychological distress\nto quality of care, reflected in living\narrangements.\u201d\nThese unaccompanied asylum-seeking children have been sent away\nfrom their families or made to flee as\na consequence of persecution, violence\nand war. Those aged between 16 and\n18 are in most instances placed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation whereas those of a younger age are entered\ninto a more supportive care system,\nincluding foster families and children\u2019s\nhomes \u2013 monitored environments\nwhere appropriate treatment can be\nadministered.\nThe team of Imperial scientists\nfound that the solitary asylum-seeking\nchildren were at a significantly greater\nrisk of developing a range of mental\nhealth problems, increasing the likelihood of unpleasant experiences such\nas frightful flashbacks and nightmares,\ncompared with their accompanied\npeers. Many more of the lone children\nwere found to have been involved in\ncombat, having experienced torture of\nsome kind as well as having been im-prisoned. As a result more than half of\nthe male and nearly three quarters of\nthe female lone asylum-seekers were\nfound to have a high risk of developing\npost-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 these\nfigures being significantly higher than\nthose for the male and female accompanied refugees, which were around\n14% and 35% respectively.\nTim Spafford is a freelance refugee\neducation consultant and has provided\nconsultancy support to schools and\nlocal authorities across the UK since\n2003. Mr Spafford explained how the\nstudy\u2019s \u201cfindings support what many\npractitioners in the field know; unaccompanied asylum-seeking children\nand young people have experienced\nenormous stresses and risks. The\nlosses they have endured and the lack\nof a caring, nurturing and safe environment in the UK means they can at\ntimes suffer poor mental health.\u201d In his\nview, \u201cthe research demands renewed\nscrutiny of the care arrangements provided\u201d for these individuals.\nDr Hodes also emphasised the importance of his research, stressing that\n\u201cthe findings are significant as they indicate that the legal claims for asylum\nof the unaccompanied children should\nbe taken very seriously. From a health\nperspective, they illustrate the importance of assessing physical health in\nthis group as many had been tortured\nor in combat and injured. They highlight the psychological difficulties and\nimportance of high-support living\narrangements.\u201d\nSpafford expressed further concerns,\ndescribing how \u201cthe research findings\nserve as a warning to those working\nin education that the legal processes\n[associated with seeking asylum] can\nincrease the refugee\u2019s fear of, and preoccupation with, the persecution they\nhave experienced. The new Home Office reforms emphasise a \u2018twin track\u2019\napproach, engaging schools and colleges in preparing the unaccompanied\nasylum-seeking children for possible\nreturn to their country of origin. This\nmay significantly increase anxiety and\nundermine learning and security.\u201d\nThis novel study powerfully illustrates the importance of supporting\nthose who seek asylum. Children arriving in the UK often have a past\nfilled with terrible experiences. It is a\nnecessity to reduce their vulnerability\nand sense of isolation and it is crucial\nto help them acquire a sense of self, allowing them to integrate into society.\nAdmittedly, monitored living arrangements are a costly alternative for the\nlocal authorities however it seems that\nthey provide the support so vital for\nthe thousands of children who have no\nchoice but to escape and flee for safety\nin their search for protection, shelter\nand a better quality of life.\n\u201cMore than half\nof lone asylum-seeking children\nhave a high risk\nof developing\npost-traumatic\nstress disorder\u201d\n\u201cThe Home\nOffice asks\nschools to\nprepare lone\nasylum-seeking\nchildren for\npossible return.\nThis may\nincrease anxiety,\nand undermine\nlearning and\nsecurity \u201d\n\n"

    "content": "15\nFriday 13 June 2008 felix\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Comment\nCaz Knight\nGenetically different baby\nI\nn the Science section of last\nweek\u2019s Felix, Laura Starr reported on the discovery of a gene\nthought to be linked to obesity.\nThe gene in question is one that\nencodes the G-protein coupled recep-tor, Melacortin 4 (MC4R), involved in\nrelaying intra-cellular messages within\nthe hypothalamic cells in the brain. Activation of this receptor leads to the inhibition of food intake and so a mutation in this gene and subsequent fault\nin how the receptor functions could\nlead to the excessive consumption of\nfood. Obesity here we come.\nBlaming the obesity pandemic on\ngenetics is a convenient way of making humankind feel as if the affliction\nis beyond our control and eliminates\nthe need for us to take responsiblity for\nour own actions.\n\u201cGenetics\u201d (I use the inverted commas as the term is thrown about rather\ntoo liberally in non-scientific litera-ture), that is to say our genome, precisely what genes we are made up of,\nhas been the key factor in our physical\nmanifestation since the dawn of time,\nsince that beautiful double-stranded,\nright-handed, 3.4 base pair per turn\nDNA molecule came to be. If genes\nwere the deciding factor in our weight\nand the amount of delicious cheese\ntopped calories we masticate and devour had little significance, then our\nobesity rates would not have changed\nover the last hundred (plus) years. (I\nwrite this hypocritically, stomach replete after enjoying a 12\u201d four cheese\npizza).\nThisisassumingourgeneshaveNOT\nchanged. Perhaps the rate of mutations\nin this particular gene have augmented\nover the last century (due to increasing carbon emissions, perhaps?) and\nso the increase in people with voluminous derrieres is because of those\ndevilish nucleic acids. Until the mass\nchange in our genetic make up can be\nproved let us assume that the population\u2019s \u2018genetics\u2019 has remained more or\nless constant.\nAs Laura\u2019s article informed us, mutations in the promoter of the gene (that\nis the sequence preceding the gene that\ncontrols its expression) were 30% more\ncommon in Indian Asians rather than\nEuropean lineage. How is is then that\nAmerica (and Britain in close competi-tion), with only 0.5% of its population\nIndian-Asian, suffers most profusely\nfrom excessive adipose tissue?\nLifestyle is the answer. And that is\nthe factor which has not remained\nconstant these hundred odd years. I\nneedn\u2019t elaborate on why lifestyle has\nchanged and how it has changed. You\nare at Imperial, go figure. Only to say\nwe Westerners eat more as more is\navailable; we eat food pumped full of\ncrap; we move less because of our jobs.\nOnce ensconced in our daily habits it is\nhard to break them especially if greater\npriorities do not allow it. Some people\nare not aware of what a healthy lifestyle\nentails: their parents have brought\nthem up on TV dinners and sloth and\nthey have only ever encountered fibre in the form of a wilted lettuce leaf\ndrowning in the viscous embrace of a\nketchup doused burger. For others it is\nnot for want of trying. If you are trying to juggle a hectic career in order to\nsustain a family, pilates will not be top\nof your \u2018to-do\u2019 list.\nPerhaps I am a little/lot jaded in my\nview of things. I suffer none of these\nmisfortunes: I have access to a wealth\nof healthy food and exercise options\nand being a student I have endless\nhours at my disposal to work on my\ntush. I am also very fortunate to be\neducated so that I know exactly what\nhappens to my endocrine system when\none heavenly mouthful of cream and\njam laden scone pervades my ileum.\nOthers do not. However, in a few years\n(and maybe as of now) due to the government vehemently campaigning for\nhealthy living, the ignorance excuse\nwill not hold.\nThis government aims to have free\nswimming for all by 2012 to encourage exercise. As far as I am concerned\nevery able bodied person has access to\nround the clock free exercise: walking.\nAgain, my abode in cosy SW6 allows\nme to amble carelessly. My young, single female counterparts in SW9 are not\nin such an easy position. As advised in\nmy previous column, bedroom raving\nis another option if the streets outside\nyour door are crack-addict addled.\n(Warning to those living in W14: lots\nof crack addicts around that area ap-parently, as I was so informed walking\nthere late last week).\nI know in a very small number of\ncases obesity is completely out of the\ncontrol of the individual. Conditions\nsuch as Bardet-Biedl syndrome are\ncharacterised by obesity. Jordan\u2019s son\nHarvey is thought to suffer from sep-to-optic dysplasia which has an effect\non movement and so his weight gain is\nunavoidable. These are rare cases and\nanyone who is in a position to loose\nweight should. Let me clarify about\nwhom I speak. I am not thinking of\nthe people with a little bulge here and\nthere. I mean the critically obese. A little bit of a belly can be quite cute and\nattractive in many cases. What I fear\nfor is people\u2019s health. When the sheer\neffort of walking is too much and lethargy leadens each lumbering footstep,\nthat is when one should rethink the\nway one lives one\u2019s life. Our appearance says a lot about us and the way\nin which we operate. I know of a CEO\nwho never employed the over-weight\nsecretaries because they exuded an air\nof slowness. Harsh, but possibly true.\nSo, the solutions. Laura\u2019s article mentions drugs which target these mutat-ed, malfunctioning proteins. Another\ndrug, tensofensine, was seen to reduce\nweight by 10% over a six month period\nby altering appetite-controlling neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine\nand noradrenaline. These are indeed\nsolutions but they do not teach people\nmoderation and how to lead a healthy\nlifestyle. Why bother eating less and\nexercising if we can just pop a pill? It\nwill take time to undo the bad habits\nwhich have crept up on us, and even\nlonger to bring the incidence of obesity\nback down but we must start towards\nthis goal.\n\u201c\nWhen the\nsheer effort of\nwalking is too\nmuch, that is\nwhen one should\nrethink the way\none lives one\u2019s\nlife\n\u201d The Cow\nDavid Stewart\nI\nthink it is time that someone set\nthe record straight on what exactly a cow is and how it came to\nbe the popular meat it is today.\nTo begin the history of the\ncow, one must go back millions of\nyears to the Vikings. Not many people\nknow that the word \u2018vi\u2019 is actually just\na shortened form of the word \u2018bovine\u2019\nand it is indeed true that Vikings considered themselves to be the Kings of\nthe Cows; this fact is documented in\nthe Qaran (see p97).\nIt is not so unreasonable a conceit\nhowever, as it has been shown using\ncarbon dating that the Vikings actually selectively bred mice for millen-nia, getting them fatter and fatter with\neach generation until eventually they\nlooked like the creatures they are to-day. In fact if you speed up the sound\nof a cow moo-ing you get precisely the\nsound of a mouse squeaking. However,\nit was not out of desire for food that\nthe Vikings bred cattle but out of their\nnotorious love of sailing. They discovered early on that mice float, which is\nwhy they chose to inflate mice through\nbreeding. (Cats for instance sink.) It is\ndue to the fat content of cows that they\nare so sea-worthy. There is a Viking\nexpression which roughly translated\nis \"If a cow should sink then it is Buddha himself that willed it so\"; such was\nthe faith that the Vikings had in their\ncows.\nThe popular misconception that Vikings sailed in longboats is probably\ndue to the fact that cows were sailed\n(ridden) in a long thin formation which\nscared off potential predators like\nplaice, since the cows together looked\nfrom underwater like a giant centipede.\nMoreover, the males were particularly\nuseful in this respect as they had horns\nwhich could be used to direct them.\nScholars now believe that the etymology of the word \u2018steer\u2019 is directly related to this. These formations were\nmistaken by native Englishmen for\n'long-boats' from far away. Another interesting consequence of this mode of\ntransport is that the first place the Vikings landed was on the Isle of Wight,\nhaving drifted a long way off course by\nan incorrect assessment of the overs-teer of the lead cow. They moored at a\nport now known as Cowes. To this day,\nno-one knows how the extra 'e' ended\nup in the modern day name, but it is\na commonly held belief that it was put\nthere as a joke.\nCows have a special place in British\nsociety. The cows, which from centuries of Viking berserking were vicious,\nunreasonable animals and would ter-rorise towns unless fed vast amounts\nof sorrel. The cows were finally defeated in the Guerre de Boeuf of\nAD1121, when an uprising was caused\nby particularly bad crop of sorrel. A\npregnant cow called Firebrand led\nthe revolt against the prevailing rul-ers, successfully storming the Norman\ncastles, apparently by 'simply walking\nthrough the gates'. The cows, who had\ndressed themselves in 'v\u00eatements fronc\u00e9s de fille\u2019 (frilly girls\u2019 clothes) looked\nso ridiculous that it was impossible to\nlook at them without collapsing into\na giggling heap. It was then that they\nwere able to kick the shit out of the opposing forces. The Normans quickly\ndeveloped a technique for telling each\nother jokes which were so bad that it\nwas impossible to laugh for five hours\nafterwards. Thus they were able to subdue the uprising and, to prevent further revolts, fed the cows vast amounts\nof cannabis until they suffered brain\ndamage and have the docile nature that\nwe currently expect from them. Indeed\nthe fact that the cows were so high all\nthe times led to quite a lot of cattle falling from cliff-tops. Local Anglo-Saxon\npeasants would collect the animal and\nsmoke it in wooden pipes, therefore\ngetting high. The subsequent munchies\nled to the taste for beef which is unabated even today.\nCurrent uses of modern cattle include incorporation into laser technol-ogy, where it has been found that they\nrefract light.\nFACT: Cows smoke da reefa, just like this mellow fellow\n\u201c\nVikings\nbred cattle but\nout of their\nnotorious love of\nsailing\nApologies that there is nothing from either A Geek or Gilead Amit\nthis week. Neither submitted anything. Weird that... eh?\n\n"

Reducing the student satisfaction weighting to zero in\nthis latest data sees Imperial in second, compared\nto the previous year\u2019s first\nplace.\nIn comparison, Cambridge ranks first place\nfor student satisfaction\nthis year, with Oxford in\n6th and UCL in 33rd.\nWhether Oxford or\nCambridge are better\ninstitutions than Imperial is debatable, but the\ndissatisfaction amongst\nImperial\u2019s student body\nis clear to see.\nS\nir Richard continued in his outspoken manner in October of\nlast year, when he slammed the\nUK\u2019s education system, not for the\nfirst time.\nThe Rector criticised so called\n\u201cMickey Mouse\u201d courses (ie: David\nBeckham studies), saying that \u201cthe\nsystem has to change.

These votes\nwere accompanied by 18 very significant abstentions.\nBack in 2004, ICU greeted the proposals with protests, and when the Bill\nwas finally passed the Union remained\nresolute. \u201cThere is still plenty to fight\nfor\u201d commented ICU\u2019s Deputy President\n(Education & Welfare).\nUniversity officials welcomed the re-sults, and the Rector\u2019s hopes became re-ality. \u201cI\u2019m extremely pleased that attempts\nto derail this vitally important bill have\nnot succeeded,\u201d Sir Richard told Felix. \u201cI\u2019m\nconvinced that it will prove to be a positive\nmove both for universities, which desperately need extra funding to maintain standards,\nand for young people ... who will have access\nto the world class teaching we provide.\u201d\nven--o-ill\ned\nght\nent\nree re-mpts\nhave\nx. \u201cI\u2019m\nositive\nperate-ndards,\ne access\ne.\u201d\nW\nhilst criticisng the government\u2019s target to ensure that 50% of school leavers\ncarry on into higher education, Sir Richard managed to single out Luton\nUniversity as a \u201cthird rate\u201d university. The Rector said that \u201cthird rate\u201d institutions are a drain on better universities, stating that \u201ca penny spent [at Imperial] is a\nhell of a lot better than a penny spent at Luton for the economy.\u201d He gave further criticism saying that \u201cit costs more to teach those kids [at third class institutions] because\nthey\u2019ve never been taught.\u201d\nThe comments landed Sir Richard in a spot of bother with university heads from\naround the country, not just Luton\u2019s Vice Chancellor. Some Vice Chancellors called\nfor him to resign from his position on HEFCE (the Higher Education Funding Council\nfor Education).\nHowever, Sir Richard later retracted the comments and wrote to both HEFCE and\nLuton\u2019s Vice Chancellor, apologising for his \u201cill considered and clumsy\u201d comments.\nS\nir Richard climbed into a small, orange mechanical exoskeleton and chiselled away at\nthe old Southside complex, marking the\nbeginning of the end for the fondly remembered\nhalls of residence.\nThe ceremony signified the realisation of two\nthings: firstly, the Rector delivering on his promise of a reconstructed Southside, and secondly,\nthe beginning of Imperial\u2019s status as a permanent\nbuilding site.\nThe building was scheduled to finish construction in October 2007, at a cost of more than \u00a350m.\nCollege almost delivered on this promise, but their\nrecord of finishing nothing on time actually remains\nintact. Many rooms lacked furnishings, toilet seats\nwere left unattached and some students still had\ntheir windows boarded up with dust sheets.\nE\nthos eventually opened its\ndoors, four months after\nit was originally scheduled to finish. Students flocked to\nmake use of the free facilities leading to a huge waiting list for gym\ninductions.\nThe opening was very well re-ceived, although some unfortunate\nstudents had to be evacuated, dripping wet, during the first week after\nthe fire alarm was activated.\nul\nm\ning\nind\nT\nceiv\nstud\nping\nC\nollege decided it would be sensible to introduce a\ndress code, applicable to all staff and students, to\nhelp \u201cmaximise our chances of detecting anyone\nwho shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\nMembers of Imperial were required to wear their swipe\ncards at all times, and to refrain from wearing clothes that\nobscured the face such as veils, scarves or hooded tops.\nThe decision, which attracted worldwide media atten-tion, was one which the College has never really lived down\nsince.

    "content": "12 felix Friday 13 June 2008\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nis voting Yes\nI\ndon't really give a toss about Union politics. I'm an average student who just wants to have fun,\nget a good degree, and do something I excel at and enjoy. Now\nI'm being asked to choose whether or\nnot the Union should stay with the\nNUS. What do I do?\nSome people tell me that the NUS\nhas done great things for students in\nthe past, and that it provides us with\na strong voice when issues affect students throughout the UK. Other people tell me that the NUS is mismanaged\nand doesn't always represent Imperial\u2019s\nviews. After doing a bit of research, I\nfound out that most of this is pretty\ntrue.\nSo it's an organisation that scores big\nKilian Frensch\nvictories but stumbles along the path,\nwhy the fuss about staying affiliated or\nnot?\nThe reason why Imperial\u2019s Union\nwants to leave is simple: some issues\nadamantly fought for by our dearest\ndelegates didn't make the cut, as other\nmembers of the NUS disagreed with\nthem. One of the reasons this repeatedly happens is because the NUS encompasses Higher and Further Education,\nwhich clearly aren't all too compatible.\nSo should we leave on the back of not\nalways getting what we want? Sounds\na bit like a petulant toddler who's unhappy that mummy wouldn't buy them\nthe newest toy. How about we accept\nthe fact that we can't always get what\nwe want, as, in this case, decisions are\ndemocratic. If democracy doesn't suit\nyou, I hear Zimbabwe are accepting\ncitizenship applications.\nAll these endless discussions bringing up reasons to stay and reasons to\nleave are really just smokescreens. The\ncrux of the issue is very simple, do you\nwant to:\n1. Have a national voice\n2. Not have a national voice\nI don't know about you, but No. 1\nsounds pretty good to me. Some people will tell you that the \u00a346k affiliation\nfee can be better used by clubs and\nsocieties, but considering that most of\nthe Union's \u00a31.3m of income doesn't go\nto C&S anyways, that seems unlikely.\nThe money will probably be lost somewhere funding some stupid float for\nthe Lord Mayor's Show, or yet another\nmerry-go-round for me to throw up on\nduring the Summer Ball.\nAt the end of the day, affiliating with\nthe NUS is kind of like taking out an\ninsurance policy. When you don't need\nit, you feel like you're wasting money.\nBut every so often you do make use of\nit, and then you're pretty damn glad\nyou had it in the first place. And therein lies a major reason why we keep having this discussion.\nIn times where we feel like we're\nnot getting anything in return, we act\nchildish and cancel our policy. So don't\nlisten to the gibberish about \u201cvalue for\nmoney\u201c or \u201cdiverse opinions\u201c and just\nkeep the insurance in case we need it\nin the future.\nInsurance for the future\nis voting Yes\nCamilla Royle\nI\nmperial joined the NUS as a\nresult of a college wide autumn\nterm referendum 18 months\nago. We have been fully ratified\nmembers, able to participate in\nNUS democracy, for just over a year.\nThis term we face leaving it as a result of a further referendum called by\nthe ICU leadership in a recent council\nmeeting. The disaffiliation campaign is\nasking students to make a huge decision about the fates of students in years\nto come.\nLeaving the NUS now would be\ntaking away the rights of future students to be part of such an organisa-tion. Taking them away when they\nneed them most- when education\nis becoming more marketised with\nuniversities being thrown into competition with each other for funding\nand an increase in top-up fees being\nconsidered.\nI opposed the recent attempt at a\ngovernance review by the NUS, not because I think the NUS is fine the way it\nis- I don\u2019t think anyone does! But there\nwere many aspects of the review which\nI disagreed with, mainly the introduction of a trustee board to NUS govern-ance. These reforms aimed to turn the\nNUS into something more like a professional lobby group than a union,\nthey were described as a union voting\nto destroy itself.\nI also disagreed with the way the\ngovernance review was carried out. An\nemergency conference was held where\none of the two rounds of voting needed to pass the review could be carried\nout- Imperial selected its delegates to\nthis by mini-bus driving ability and\nnames pulled out of a hat. I also don\u2019t\nremember any kind of consulting process for ordinary students to express\ntheir views on it.\nThe National Union of Students was\nproposinganewstructurewhichwould\nhave meant that minority student\ngroups would potentially be excluded\nfrom the decision making structure of\nthe NUS. Put simply, the Nomination\nCommittee which would have been\nselected by the Board of Trustees (one\nof the most powerful bodies in the new\nproposed structure) would have been\nresponsible for recommending who\nshould sit on the Board of Trustees. Effectively, the Board of Trustees would\nbe a self-selecting body. There would\nnot have been guaranteed representation of the smaller student groups\nsuch as those who are part of the Liberation campaigns (Women, Black\nstudents, disabled students and LGBT\nstudents).\nThe NUS needs to have more of a\npresence on campuses, be more relevant and ask students what issues\nthey care about. Tweaking the way the\nNUS is governed would ultimately do\nlittle to change this and risks making\nthe situation worse by alienating people that aren\u2019t interested in governance\nstructures.\nThe NUS is our chance, as students,\nto have a voice on a national level. It is\nour chance to stand up and be count-ed. It is our chance to ensure that the\ngovernment hears us loud and clear.\nThe fact that the governance review\ndid not pass this year should not be\nused as an excuse to throw all our\ntoys out of the pram and disaffiliate.\nWe need to be involved to make a\nchange.\nWhether you were for or against the\ngovernance review is irrelevant in this\ndebate, the fact is that the NUS is our\nvoice. If we disaffiliate today, we don\u2019t\nlose a discount card, we lose our voice.\nIt\u2019s your vote, use it wisely.\nStay in and change it for the better\nis voting No\nMatty Hoban\nThere\u2019s currently no \u2018us\u2019 in NUS\nW\nhen I go back to my\nhometown, I inevitably end up talking politics with my\ndad: He is a Tory, I\nam a Lefty; He reads the Telegraph, I\nread the Guardian; He loves Boris, I\nvoted for Ken; However, we both believe that tuition fees are negative to\neducation, so did any of the previous\ninformation matter? In short, no, and\nthis appears to me to be the problem\nwith the NUS.\nWhether \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018left\u2019, these labels\nactually begin to define you to the\npoint where your initial philosophical\nliberation by discovering politics becomes an imprisoning experience; you\nare subjugated to each other\u2019s expectations to the point where the only thing\ndriving your idealism is your opposition of the other\u2019s viewpoint. Now, do\nnot get me wrong, I believe that argument and disagreement are healthy for\npolitics, but with the caveat that they\nare about the issues and not the people\nthemselves. For example, many in the\nNUS ascendancy want to give the BNP\nno platform from which to speak. Now,\nI hate the BNP more than anything,\nbut the fact that they were elected (no\nmatter how flawed the democracy, as I\nshall discuss in a second) means they\ndeserve to speak. Such petty issues distract from the business of representing\nstudents.\nMany complain that the far-left are\nruining the NUS, I would argue that\nthey are a symptom of deeper prob-lems. Firstly, eight delegates (that are\nsent to NUS conferences) is too many.\nFor Imperial this is around 1500 students per delegate: about the turnout\nat a sabbatical election. This allows extremist factions to form due to the low\namount of votes needed for them to\nbe elected. Attempts at reforming this\nfailed at the last convention. Although,\nI still believe even if reformed, that the\ndivisions within the NUS are so deep\nas to still render it ill-suited to representing students.\nNaturally, I would support the NUS\nas an organisation for positive change\nand a platform on issues such as affordable housing, equality, financial\nsupport for the poor and education\nquality support. However, when I look\nto an institution, I look for decisiveness and self-belief, not the bickering\nthat emanates from all elements of its\npolitical spectrum.\nI think Henry Kissinger put it succinctly when he said, \u201cUniversity politics are vicious precisely because the\nstakes are so small.\u201d I would add that\nthe stakes are not small. However, the\nNUS seems to continue the image of\nKissinger\u2019s student politics. This leaves\nthe government uninterested and un-challenged. A government that happily\nincreases tuition fees.\nThere have been some victories over\nthe years such as the Council Tax student exemption, issues that transcended the spectrum and affected everyone\n\u2013 things can get done. Our sabbatical\nofficers get trained and also we can\nget discounts (at a price) whilst being\npart of the only large student-led organisation in the country. Despite all\nof this, we cannot avoid the fact that\nvoter turnout at any higher education\ninstitution is well below substantial\nand the NUS representatives are elected with small mandates no matter how\nmany of them are elected.\nThis is a fundamental problem of\nstudent activism and politics, and then\nif turnout is increased then maybe the\nNUS will have earned its reputation as\nthe national student voice. Trust needs\nto be restored in student representatives that they can actually change\nthings for the better. Until then the\n\u2018right\u2019 will constantly talk about representing \u2018normal students\u2019 who just\nwant a well-paid job in the City after\nuniversity, and the \u2018left\u2019 will talk about\n\u2018normal students\u2019 who cares about the\nexploitation and evils of capitalism in\nthe City. Both sides invoke an imaginary \u2018normal student\u2019 who is actually\ntypically the person who does not vote\nfor them, so it is a matter of second\nguessing.\nI have two solutions: firstly, bloody\nvote in the referendum, even if it is\nduring exams (which does suck), it will\nshow everyone that you care and give\nthose who try to represent you something to represent you on; secondly,\nand more fundamentally I propose rebuilding the NUS as a de-centralised,\nregional and apolitical organisation\nthat only deals directly with issues of\nwelfare and educational standards of\nhigher education institutions. I believe\nthat politics is integral to how we live,\nbut we can do without party politics\nthat only serves to compromise our\nalready fragile platform. Our nationwide institutional differences are not a\nmatter of elitism in my opinion but in\ngeneral of geographical location, London universities share a lot of the same\nproblems regardless of their standing in the flawed league tables. These\nregional student unions can then be\nbrought together to resolve larger issues and hopefully we can finally prove\nKissinger wrong.\n\n"

We\u2019ll give a prize out in the\nsummer. The more entries, the better your chances.\nHow to play:\nCrudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar to Minesweeper mixed with a\ndash of Sudoku.\nThe object of the game is to draw\nlines between the dots to create one\nlong, and most importantly, looping\nline. It should have no start or finish;\njust like an elastic band.\nEach number indicates how many\nlines should be drawn around it, for\nexample:\nCells which don\u2019t contain a number\ncan be surrounded by any number of\nlines.\nRemember, the line must form a\nloop, so the line cannot branch. The\nfollowing situations are not allowed:\nSquares are not allowed either. There\nare never cells containing the number\n4 in Slitherlink.\nSo, where do you start? The most\ncommon place to start on a Slitherlink grid is by drawing crosses\naround any zeros. Drawing crosses\nis purely done to so that you know\nwhere there can\u2019t possibly be a line.\nSo, take the pattern below as an ex-ample. Begin by drawing crosses,\nthen by filling in some lines:\nNow the lines can only continue in\nthe following directions:\nSlitherlink 1,407\n3\n2 2\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\n1,406 solution\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\nTEXT US!

    "content": "felix sport Send in your sport reports:\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHigh resolution photos only\nIC Women\u2019s cricket team bat their way to history\nThis term has seen us make history\nfor the IC Cricket Club. The women\u2019s\nteam having been newly formed last\nyear, entered it\u2019s first official tourna-ment, the BUSA south-east league.\nThis was a great opportunity for us\nladies to develop our game and gave\nmatch experience to some of the more\nnovice players. The teams we were up\nagainst were UCL, Kings, and Southampton. We had previously played an\nindoor friendly against Kings in the\nwinter, but UCL and Southampton\nwere unknown to us, so the tension\nbegan to build before our first scheduled match away at Southampton. We\nput long hours in nets, had the minibus\nbooked and were ready and assembled\nearly one Sunday morning for our trip\ndown to the coast.\nRain stopped play. It was all very disappointing when we got a call to say\nour game was cancelled due to a flooded pitch and unrelenting rain. Cricket\nis just not possible in the rain, and as\nis obvious when playing the sport here\nin the UK, the wet-weather strategy\ncan play an important part. Unfortunately neither side could offer a team\nfor an alternative day and so it ended\nin a draw.\nNext up was UCL at our home\nground in Harlington, but the weather\nwas failing to improve and alas another\nmatch was called off by rain. Our ladies\nswiftly agreed to an alternative date to\nbe played away, but UCL were unable\nto put forward a team, giving us a default win. Although we were frustrated\nat the lack of play, we were looking\nhealthy on the league table and confident to take on Kings in the next home\nmatch. Sun was shining and we finally\nthought we\u2019d get out on the field, but\nKings called last minute to cancel due\nto a lack of players, giving us the win!\nDisappointed but undeterred we\npacked up a lovely tea and headed to\nHarlington to play Southampton. Finally, this gave co-captains Sian and\nDharani a chance to make some deci-sions! We lost the toss and fielded first,\nwe kept their run rate low and managed to get them all out for 69 runs,\nwith Tara getting us a key wicket. After tea our batters headed out to the\ncrease, but things started looking worrying when the top end of our batting\ncrumpled early. Realising that it was\nstaying power we needed rather than\nruns, Priya and Clare kept cool heads,\nforming a good partnership and held in\nto give us the win we were after.\nIn glorious sunshine the following\nSunday we took a train up to Potters\nBar followed by a bus that confusingly\ndropped us on a bridge over the M25,\nand navigated our way to the UCL\nsports ground. We were all a bit nervous taking on UCL who had a reputation as a strong side. Winning the\ntoss we batted first, and put in a much\nbetter performance than our previous\nmatch. Making 40 runs for 3, on the\nfourth wicket we decided to up the\nrun rate and start smashing it around\nbringing us to a total of 82 before tea,\nDharani and Georgie top-scoring. Despite the great effort, we were unable\nto defend our run rate and UCL narrowly took the win.\nFor the next fixture, we headed to\nplay Kings. With greater match experience now, there was a calmer feeling\namongst our players and we knew what\nwe needed to do. We won the toss and\ntook on the Kings bowlers first. Karmani and Clare opened forming a strong\npartnership they made a fantastic 53\nruns together. The wicket was incredibly slow, with little or no bounce and\nwe worked hard and finished our innings with an incredible 151 runs. This\nwas our first triple digit score as a team\nand it felt great. With great wickets\nfrom Sian and Flo and some awesome\ncatches, we easily defended our score,\nfinishing the game ahead by 110 runs.\nNarrowly missing out on winning\nthe league, we still qualified for the National BUSA Shield knock-outs.\nWe were set up to play Bournemouth,\nwho were rumoured to have an England reserves player and an England\n1st XI coach. With another chance to\ntake a union minibus down to the sea-side, we packed up our bats and pads\nand gathered outside the union early\nlast Wednesday morning. Down came\nthe rain again, and washed our hopes\naway, as they predictably called to cancel and rearrange the game for the Friday. Sadly the rescheduled day was not\nconvenient for some of our girls and\nwe could only put out a team of eight.\nWe won the toss and opted to bowl\nfirst. Starting with eight players, Clare,\narriving straight from her presentation\nhalf way though the first innings took\nus up to a total of nine! All the bowlers really showed how good they could\nbe, Flo, Dharani, Priya and Clare all\nbowled brilliantly, with Priya taking\nher first of what will hopefully be many\nwickets for Imperial. Although some\nquick thinking and fielding by Aleeza\ncaused an early run out we could not\nshake their best player, the England re-serve, who got most of their runs (103\nof a 181 score) so it was with much\nsatisfaction that Sian caught her off\nClare\u2019s bowling in the last over. Everyone preformed amazingly well, considering it was Aleeza, Thubeena and\nChristina\u2019s first ever cricket match.\nVeena too showed her potential, successfully stopping a number of bound-aries. Following a great start at chasing\ntheir total, we lost a few wickets early\nand could not quite keep the run rate\nup to what it needed to be, falling a few\nruns short of the total.\nConsidering most of our cricketers\nhave been playing for less than a year,\nwe aim to be even bigger and better\nnext season! A special thanks should\ngo to our founding member and captain Sian Fogden for her amazing enthusiasm and cricketing talent. She\nhas worked tirelessly for the team for\nthe past three years and will be sadly\nmissed!\nAlthough the fixtures are over, net\nsessions will continue into the summer\nand some possible friendlies to be or-ganised. If you are at all interested in\njoining in, or just to see what cricket\nis like, please contact the newly appointed captains Priya and Dharani\nat icwomenscricket@googlemail.com.\nWe welcome anyone from newcomers\nto the sport to oldhands.\nEmilie Michie\nRain, rain go away\nIC women\u2019s cricket make triple figures against King\u2019s Medics\n\n"

Warning: contains immoral behaviour for your benefit\nT\nhink of a communist\ncountry. Did Cuba, Laos\nor North Korea spring to\nmind first? Most likely not\n\u2013 most likely you would\nhave thought initially of China. Alternatively, think of China. Most likely\n\u201ccommunist\u201d is one of the first things\nthat you associate with it.\nAs a tourist venturing into a communist country for the first time, I was extremely curious to see if it was an imagined label for the country, or whether\nit was something more tangible that\ncould be seen to affect people on a daily\nbasis. Obviously, my short trip (and my\nignorance of politics) meant that it was\nnot enough to answer this question in\nany great depth, but it was interesting for me to see superficially at least,\nwhether this country seemed different\nfrom others in a way that could be attributed to its communist label.\nTaking it to the extreme, some of my\nimagined \u201csigns\u201d of a communist country would be a heavy military pres-ence; a reliance on official documents\nthat makes the NHS appear to be free\nof bureaucracy; and a solidarity and\nunity within the country\u2019s population.\nWhen it comes to official documents,\nmy personal experience left my opinion unchanged. Two hours of waiting\nat the Chinese Embassy (thankfully\nshortened by the presence of a very\nattractive guy I chatted to \u2013 if you are\nhim, get in touch), three days without a passport and 40 pounds sterling\nlighter finally got me a Chinese visa,\nand easy entry into the country \u2013 or\nso I thought. Upon arriving at immigration control however, the officer\nscrutinised my photograph closely.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like you,\u201d he told\nme. Well of course not, I thought, no\ngrimacing, miserable creature ever resembles their true selves on their pass-port. \u201cDo you have any other ID?\u201d he\nasked me. Well, no I didn\u2019t, as I thought\nmy passport would suffice, but having\nno choice I pulled out my oyster card,\nvarious library cards and my Imperial\ncard, all with marginally better photos of myself on them. (Incidentally, it\nis the Imperial card that I believe was\n24 felix Friday 13 June 2008\nand so, thankfully, I was allowed into\nthe country. A tendency to rely on official documents? Check.\nTwo issues ago I mentioned my initial two days in Beijing, so let\u2019s skip forwards to the third day. I was on something of a whirlwind tour of the city.\nThe third day of my tour proved an\ninteresting one since I had to pose as a\nstudent from Oxford. Before you shout\n\u201ctraitor\u201d and hurl stones at me, please\nunderstand that this was the only way\nI could take full advantage of the tours\noffered by Beijing University to the Oxford students on exchange there. And\nthis meant a free tour guide, and free\nentry to all the sites. Was my loyalty\nthe most important. Having a similar\nproblem in Singapore, I pulled out this\nparticular magic card, and the officer\nsays \u201cOh! You go to Imperial!\u201d and I\nwas waved into the country. So the\ncard may be defunct when it comes to\nprinting at the IC library, but I now believe it holds special magical power in\nsticky situations which nobody could\nhave imagined).\nAnyway, after examining my various\ncards, the officer must have concluded\nthat the bespectacled, blurry version of\nmy passport-self did not resemble the\nperson standing before him, but my\nangelic countenance could not possibly have posed a threat to his country,\nto Imperial such that I refused to don\nsuch a ridiculous guise for the entirety\nof the day? Nope, of course not.\nSo I brushed up my accent, my wit,\nmy sense of smugness, and adjusted\nthe way my scarf was wrapped around\nmy neck, and I was ready to go. I\u2019m\nsure I could have fooled Oscar Wilde\nhimself... The only problem (and as\nit turned out, it was quite a big prob-lem) was that the tour guide, I swear,\nseemed specifically intent on catching my eye when it came to addressing\nquestions towards the group. \u2018Er...\u2019 was\nthe best I could manage on every occa-sion, much to the bemusement of my\nfellow Oxfordians. Thankfully, someone would normally step in before I\nexposed myself as being an Imperialite,\nand being thought of as the most clu-less and ignorant of students seemed\na small price to pay, seeing as this is a\ndaily occurance for me at Imperial any-way. I made a mental note to brush up\non my Chinese history however \u2013 one\nnever knows when the knowledge that\nthe Ming dynasty ruled from 1368 to\n1644 could come in so useful.\nOur first stop was the Heavenly\nTemple; so called because the temple is\nbuilt specifically to symbolize the connection between Heaven and Earth.\nCircles represent heaven and squares\nrepresent earth. The unity of the two\nwas clearly carefully thought out during the temple\u2019s construction. I\u2019m sure\nI couldn\u2019t appreciate the architectural\neffort, but the temple itself is certainly\nheavenly for the eye to see.\nIt is not the temple however, that\nremains foremost in my memory, but\nmore the congregation of Chinese\npeople gathered within the temple\ngrounds, which is nearly 3km big.\nThe people were all engrossed in their\nvarious sports and activities, and the\nsuperb talent on display meant that\nstrolling the grounds was something\nakin to watching a free variety show.\nLike something out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, all sports were\ncarried out with a combination of inspiring grace and amazing acrobatics.\nThere were people practising a sort\nof bat-and-ball game, which involved\nkeeping a dimpled ball balanced on a\nracquet whilst swirling and twirling\nit in all directions around the air and\noneself. If this wasn\u2019t difficult enough,\nthere were many people practising\nJianzi \u2013 like keepy-uppies with a foot-ball, only the ball is substituted with a\ngiant weighted shuttlecock.\nThere were mini-plays being per-The view across Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City, albeit on a very smoggy day\nMao\u2019s Mausoleum in the rather gray Tiananmen Square The entrance to the Forbidden City\n\n"

Imperial College Union has\nsold less than 600 of these cards in total which suggests that the overwhelming majority of Imperial students do not think that this represents a good deal.\nAll companies who offer student discounts are legally\nobliged to give them on production of a valid student\nID so we don\u2019t need the NUS Extra rip off.\nMyth:-It will cost ICU tens of thousands of pounds to\nregister with the Charity Commission.\nFacts:- The \u00a3100,000 figure quoted by Wes Streeting\nas the cost of another London Union registering with\nthe Charity Commission mostly consisted of consultancy work that was not part of the registration process\nand that ICU would not be required to repeat. In any\ncase, NUS does not provide you with tailored advice\nand ICU would still have to pay our own bills as we\ndid with the legal advice we sought last year when ICU\nreviewed our decision making structures despite being NUS affiliates.\nMyth:- The NUS will reform before Christmas.\nFacts:- No timetable for the next attempt to change\nNUS has been set\nMyth:- It is possible to enter in to a debate with the\nopponents of a new NUS.\nFacts:- Hard left groups such as Student Respect represent the worst excesses of NUS and they will continue to shout and scream that changing NUS so that\nmore money is spent on campaigning and less on\npolitical meetings is \u201cundemocratic\u201d.

Instead the building would be\nrefurbished at a cost of \u00a36m to \u201cencourage greater\ncommunication.\u201d Before this refurbishment would\nhappen though, he promised priority to be given to\nbuilding a new sports centre in Prince\u2019s Gardens and\nthe refurbishment of the crumbling Southside halls.\nA\nfter four weeks of discussions, the spirits\nof thousands of Imperial students hoping\nfor a well-balanced university lifestyle were\ncrushed, when it emerged that the proposed merger\nbringing Imperial and University College London\n(UCL) together as one \u2018uber-versity\u2019 had been called\noff.\nSir Richard claimed that it had \u201cbecome clear\nthat the best interests of our two institutions are\nnot served by a formal merger.\u201d\nHowever, this was more of an assumption on the\nRector\u2019s part; one senior academic from UCL told\nFelix about IC\u2019s political intention, describing the\nproposals as a takeover rather than a true merger.\nThe academic referred to the situation as \u201cmore of a rape than\na marriage.\u201d\nUltimately, the merger crumbled since many UCL academics\nfeared that it would leave many of their scientists without jobs,\nwhereas Imperial\u2019s staff would suffer far less.\nC\nontinuing in his attempts to push and increase\nImperial\u2019s global presence, Sir Richard entirely rebranded College, ditching the traditional crest for\ntoday\u2019s more corporate, minimalist blue logo.\nBack in 2003, the logo was branded \u201cembarrassing\u201d by\nstudents, who felt it smacked of \u201cWelcome to London\nPolytechnic!\u201d\nNew signs were initially constructed, \u201cBlue Peter style\u201d,\nas College staff members sticky-taped new signs over the\nold ones. The rebranders declared \u201cthe white is an important colour in our clean, modern [society].\u201d However, the\nclean look was severely hampered only eight hours later\nwhen one sign outside Huxley began to peel off.\nCollege also introduced new writing guidelines to help\nmembers\u201cunderstand\u201dthebranding,includingthediscouragement of using \u2018IC\u2019 instead of \u2018Imperial\u2019 and that communications ought to be \u201cauthoritative, not dictatorial.\u201d\nS\nir Richard made his intentions for Imperial\neven clearer when he appointed the very first\nPro-Rector (International Relations).\nProfessor David Ewins was appointed and tasked\nwith promoting Imperial abroad to industries and\npotential students. The Rector wanted to make\nImperial\u2019s brand much stronger, in order to pull in\nmore funding to help remedy the financial problems\nCollege had back at the turn of the millennium,\nand so that Imperial could compete better with the\nworld\u2019s leading institutions.\n\n"

    "content": "31\nfelix\nFriday 13 June 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nWhat was effectively the 2XI\u2019s ULU\nsemi-final game, started in stark contrast to that of the 1XI who had played\ntheirs the previous weekend. Having\narrived a respectable two hours before\nthe game in order to warm up thor-oughly, they systematically sabotaged\ntheir chances of winning with the bat,\nball and in the field.\nOur tale begins with my arrival at the\nunion at the supposed meeting time of\n10.30, where I was greeted by glorious South Kensington sunshine, the\nrasping shrieks of the Kendo club and\na respectable total of FOUR players.\nAs the sky quickly turned an alarming shade of grey the scent of trouble\nbegan to loom in the air. Slowly gathering more of our PUNCTUAL members we were subjected to a series of\nunfortunate setbacks involving the\nminibus keys, which finally resulted\nin us abandoning our scheduled mode\nof transport and frantically letting\nloose on public transport ALMOST 2\nHOURS LATER. The team tactically\nsplit up as we travelled to various underground stations in order to get lifts\nfrom our better connected teammates.\nAll in all in spite of this commotion we\nmanaged to arrive SAFELY before the\nforfeit deadline of 2.30.\nOn arrival at the UCL ground near St\nAlbans we were greeted to a well mani-cured, lush looking sports complex.\nHowever, unsurprisingly, the football\ntook pride of place as they trained on\nthe Wimbledon perfect outfield of the\nmain square and we were relegated to\nthe contingency pitch. Two prior days\nof rain of this less thoroughly tended to\nwicket had left us with horrible position of playing 80 overs on a pitch as\nmoist as a peat bog. Closer inspection\nwith the fingers nearly resulted in them\nbeen swallowed whole into the earth.\nUCL won the toss and wisely elected us to bat. The sensational talents\nof Adnan (9) and Suraj \u201cFatty Batter\u201d\nDhanani (15) were no match for the\ntroubles possessed by the pitch. Successive battering by their bowlers and\nour swiping shots resulted in large craters and excessive amounts of rubble\non its surface, forcing our openers to\navert attention to their green fingers.\nThe unprepared feet of slippery toed\nCaptain Slow (Ali Najefi) (28) cut short\nthe fine display of our very own Bollywood hero Kavington (30), as he\nseemed poised on the verge of making\na big score. It was no matter as Sabah\n(re-elected President and \u2018God\u2019 to\nmany of us) made short work of exceptional bowling. His fifty was reached in\ndouble quick time, despite agile captaincy and shrewd field placement by\nthe opposition. He relieved the pressure from our lower order and brought\nup his fifty with an all-run four, barely\nraising a sweat and certainly not out\nof breath. Jeeves (29), author of this\npiece, played a valuable second-fiddle\netching his name in divots near the\ncow corner boundary. This gave our\ninnings a much needed acceleration\nhelping our score from 70 at the half\nway mark to a formidable 210 by close;\ntaking into account the shambolic state\nof the wicket.\nHowever errors detected by the opposition due to the poor mathematical\nprowess of our inexperienced scorer,\nmedic Hemant the destroyer Laxaman\nprovided an early interruption to our\nbowling. A mothers meeting ensued\non pitch resulting in a more reserved\nestimate of 200-7 finally being agreed.\nAll involved fear that their runs may\nhave been noted down as extras or\neven worse, given to Sabah, with a confused Jefi adamant this he was robbed\nof a grander score (he wasn\u2019t).\nThe afternoon in the field was largely\nuneventful. Catch after catch was\ndropped behind the stumps that led to\nsome inspirational, if not slightly unorthodox tactics by the master craftsmen Khayam. His string of beamers\nunnerved the batsmen and forced errors on more than one occasion. The\ncat-like reflexes of Adnan at gully were\nmatched by the comical galloping of\nour captain PORNO as his successful back peddling helped preserve his\n100 percent catching stats. Bowling by\nMezza and Nihal along with Hemant\nand myself ensured that UCL never\ncame close to our target as the game\nslowly fizzled out.\nThe preparation prior to the game\nwas far from ideal, but by tackling\nthese challenges as a team undoubtedly help exercised our wits. Each\nmember stepped up to play their part\nin a win that still leaves us unbeaten in\nULU and out and out favourites to win\nthe cup. Bring it Queen Mary\u2019s.\nRajiv Shah\nConvincing win as Imperial bat down opposition\nVed smashing the opposition for six\nRubbish. This is not a word associated\nwith Kendo. Especially not with our\n10th anniversary weekend. The social\nevent of the calendar year began one\nSaturday morning not so long ago with\na three-hour open practice session.\nPresent were three senior sensei- a 4th\ndan from the University of Kent, a 5th\ndan (our very own Emiko Yoshikawa),\na Japanese 6th dan as well as around\n35 armoured lower grades. Together\nall helped make the Union Gym oscillate to thumps and cries whilst trying\nto bash the spots of their opponents.\nBy the end of the session shinai splinters were strewn about and a few more\nholes existed in what is already a pretty\nbeat up floor (Take note union penny\npinchers!).\nFollowing this workout the Imperial\nkendo crew took a trip to the nearby\nV&A where they were given an in\ndepth tour of the Japanese section by\ntheir multi-talented sensei, Yoshikawasama. As if this wasn\u2019t enough for a day,\nthe lucky members of Imperial\u2019s finest\nclub took a trip to the plush surroundings of the \u2018Thai on the River\u2019 restaurant in Battersea for a commemoration\ndinner. Amply provided for with wine,\nrice and cake these fortuitous few celebrated the successes and challenges of\nthe past ten years. Naturally more was\nyet to come.\nThe following day saw the main event\nof the anniversary: a unique seminar\nand competition combo held in Ethos.\nFor this, the great and the good came\nfrom all over the country to have a\ngo. Kendoka from Cambridge, Kent,\nUCL, and the University of the Arts\nformed the backbone of the contenders with a smattering of old Imperial\nAlumni from Japan to add spice to the\nmix. Leading this competition was the\n7th-dan Japanese coach of the British\nNational squad (Matsumoto-sensei). A\nfriend of the club, this gentleman has\nfeatured before in this paper.\nThe morning began with a training\nseminar focussing on basic techniques.\nLike all martial arts the key to Kendo is\nto rigorously understand and apply the\nbasics- something Imperial\u2019s club has\nalways put at the front of its practice.\nAfter this \u201ctuning-up session\u201d we sat\ndown to a free bento-box meal provided by the Japanese food shop \u2018NaturalNatural\u2019. Nothing quite like a bit of cold\nfish of a lunch time to put you in the\nspirit for hitting your friends.\nAfter this, and a year in the plan-ning, came the competition. Unique\nin its layout a fight\u2019s winner stayed in,\nand for dan grades, if there was a draw\nelimination beckoned. The 50-odd\nattendees happily filled the hall and\ndemonstrated some pretty nice kendo.\nOf interest were the fights amongst the\nhigher grades since, not content with\njust watching, referees joined the fray.\nWe were treated to the spectacle of our\nsensei (5th-dan) having at the sensei\nfrom the University of the Arts (Lon-don), a 5th-dan and former captain of\nthe Korean National Ladies team. Funnily enough neither could draw a point\nout of the other so they both fell out\nof the competition. It is good to know\nyour teacher is amongst the best. This\nled up to the final match.\nMatsumoto-sensei (7th dan) against\na Japanese 6th dan from the University of Kent. Unlike other matches that\nrevolved around physicality (heated\nthrust, rapid retreat and pushing) this\nmatch was almost serene in compari-son. Minimal movement was made\nwith emphasis being on sensing small\nopenings made by the sword tips. Then\nin a flash it was all over.\nMatsumoto cut a rapid hit to his\nopponent\u2019s kote (wrist) and took the\nmatch. Winners took home special\ngifts including Imperial College ten-egui (head cloth) and for one lucky\nUCL student (viewed to have put up\nthe longest series of fights) a bento box\nstuffed to the brim with fresh sushi- all\ncourtesy of our main sponsor the Japan\nCentre.\nLooking back it was a fine weekend\nand helped reaffirm friendships, as\nKendo Club celebrate 10 year anniversary\nTim Simpson well as make new ones. There is a special Kendo term for this: kou ken chi\nai (knowing others by the crossing of\nswords). So there you have it. Ten years\non and still going strong. Here\u2019s for the\nnext ten!\nRepeat: Kendo is not rubbish. Kendo is not rubbish.\n\n"

The fact is, the financial mismanagement has been brought under\ncontrol in recent years and the other\ntwo problems, while true, are not the\nmost compelling reason to vote against\nNUS. I no longer believe reforming\nNUS will resolve the deep-rooted cultural issues it faces.\nMediocrity\nThe NUS seeks to represent over 7 million students, most of those in Further\nEducation colleges around the country.\nThe rest come from over 100 universi-ties, both good and bad. With such a\ndiverse membership, consensus can be\ndifficult to achieve, but the NUS will\ntake a stance even in the face of strong\nobjections. NUS must reflect the needs\nof the majority of its members, the vast\nmajority of whom have nothing in\ncommon with Imperial\u2019s students. As a\nresult, NUS can be nothing more than\nwhat it represents: the average. The\nmajority of members are not in higher education, and most of those that\nare come from average universities.\nNUS does provide a national voice,\nbut that voice is \u2013 and always will be\n\u2013 \u2018average\u2019.\nOur voice at Annual Conference was\nshouted down by those, including the\nnew VP (Higher Education) Aaron\nPorter, who branded us \u201celitist\u201d. Our\ncrime was wanting to keep tuition fee\nmoney paid by our students within\nImperial, rather than handing it over\nto a National Bursary Scheme for distribution to other universities. The\nscheme is only necessary because the\ngovernment regulator failed to ensure\nuniversities spent enough of their tuition fee income on bursaries, yet having failed in this respect NUS proposes\nwe give them the money to dish out\nthemselves.\nInstitutional mediocrity means NUS\nis incapable of being our national voice,\nno matter how much it reforms. Our\nstudents want to be the best, the NUS\nspeaks for the average.\nHypocrisy and Division\nThe NUS has a culture of division, discrimination and blinkered ignorance\nwhich was shown at annual conference\nin April. A motion called for opposition to anti-terror laws and moves to\nhave universities spy on their students\n\u2013 not because they infringe on personal freedoms, or because they herald\nthe start of long periods of detention\nwithout trial, but because in the current climate they are being used to target one group.\nTwo people called instead for a wider\ndiscussion on national security, pointing out that the new laws may be necessary to keep people safe. This could\nhave been a good debate on how national security issues affect academic\nfreedoms, but for one problem. Those\nspeaking for opposition to the laws\nwere Muslims, those calling for a wider\ndiscussion were white men. In the NUS\nit seems important to keep track of the\nrace and gender of those speaking.\nNUS President Gemma Tumelty had\nspottedthese\u201cwhitemales\u201d(herwords)\nand condemned them for challenging\nthe other speakers, as they could have\nno idea what it was like to be on the receiving end of anti-terror laws. While\ntrue, they had every right to express\ntheir concerns about being blown up\nby terrorists. She turned it into a race\nissue when it needn\u2019t have been one:\nterrorism affects Muslims just as much\nas is affects white males, bombs are in-discriminate. The implementation of\nthese laws has a disproportionate focus\non the Muslim community currently,\nbut they can affect everyone. For thirty\nyears the #1 terrorists in this country\nwere white males, and the last person\nto blow themselves up in a (bodged)\nterrorist attack was the white male\nNicky Reilly.\nRather than having a sensible debate\non national security issues, hearing the\nconcerns of both sides, Tumelty chose\nto discriminate against a group based\non their gender and the colour of their\nskin. NUS uses racism issues to whip\npeople up into a placard-waving fren-zy, but is not interested in listening to\ndiverse views.\nIn Conclusion\nA culture of excessive political cor-rectness, where the majority are condemned for expressing their views,\nstifles open debate and prevents what\ncould be important input into the decision making process.\nAttempting to represent such a diverse range of students means the NUS\ncannot be the voice we need it to be, as\nthe bursary issue shows.\nNUS suffers from institutional medi-ocrity, hypocrisy, division and contra-diction. Don\u2019t vote \u2018No\u2019 because NUS\nreforms failed to go through, vote \u2018No\u2019\nbecause the problems are so deep they\nwouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway.\nA longer version of this article can\nbe found at http://live.cgcu.net/\neditions/nus/1782\nis voting Yes\nSalman Waqar\nOnce more, with feeling!\nI\n\u2019ve always thought of the NUS\nas a bit like Marmite. You either:\nlove it, hate it, or haven\u2019t heard\nof it. But even amongst the Marmite population, you get this\nodd batch of people, who don\u2019t really\ncare or have much to say. I hope that I\ncan provide some insight as to why we\nshould be just a little bit less apathetic\non this matter. Let\u2019s start with a bit of\nhistory.\nIn 2006, the college voted to re-affili-ate with the NUS. One of the main sell-ingpointswasdiminishednationalrep-resentation, as we were leaving ULU. It\nwas thought that without the support\nof ULU, Imperial\u2019s voice in the wider\nworld would be lost; and we would\nbecome isolated and unable to campaign effectively. And of course, there\nwere some who thought that the NUS\nCard would herald a prosperous era of\nstudent discounts \u2013 unfortunately this\ndidn\u2019t quite happen, although the 5%\ndiscount on Amazon is quite handy.\nI can\u2019t really comment on the level\nof support that ULU offered, but I\u2019ve\nheard it wasn\u2019t much. What\u2019s interesting is why was there no furore about\nULU affiliation before the disaffiliation\ntook place. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong,\nbut we left ULU because we decided\nthat for Imperial to progress, we needed to be our own institution, and thus,\nour motives were academic. It seemed\nlike sacrilege back then to mention getting out of ULU.\nAnyway, we decided to jump back\non the NUS bandwagon. But when we\njoined, the NUS was in the middle of\na governance revolution. The so-called\nGovernance Review was designed to\nradically alter the way the NUS was\nstructured, in an attempt to cut down\nthe amount of time spent talking.\nInstead of having one policy and decision making body; the new structure\nwould split the work into two. This\ngave an executive body \u2013 the Senate,\nconsisting of the President and other\nexecutive members, and a 14 member legislative body \u2013 the Board. The\ntheory was that the board would provide some accountability and ensure\nthat everything was legally and financially sound. The NUS delegates would\nthen draft whitepapers in conferences\ncalled Zones, and present them to the\nBoard, who would analyse them. The\nannual conference would vote on the\npaper and then the Senate would implement it.\nThe problem with this was that the\nBoard itself had little accountabil-ity. Furthermore, Board membership\ncould be manipulated to suit political\nneeds \u2013 external non-student trustees\ncould be appointed onto the Board.\nOthers were not too happy with veto\npowers of the Senate and Board. This\ngave them the power to reject anything\nthat was passed up from the Zones, in\nthe name of financial and legal peril.\nThe lack of representation from LGBT,\nDisabled and Black groups on the\nBoard caused further irritation, as they\nhad dedicated positions before.\nIn the end, the review was defeated\nby just 25 votes\nIn some ways the call for referendum\nwas expected, anyone who was at the\nconference would know how much of\na joke it was. I was also there this year,\nbut not with IC \u2013 and I completely\nsympathise with the cynicism that the\ndelegates expressed.\nPeople think that the NUS talks too\nmuch about Palestine, Darfur etc. If\nyou look at the agenda for the con-ference, all these issues are the VERY\nLAST things that are discussed. This\nyear, only Darfur was debated because\nconference ran out of time! The NUS\nmight think that it\u2019s the UN, but it\u2019s up\nto us to stop it from thinking like that.\nImagine if there were plans afloat\nto rid of international students at Imperial. Could ICU with its limited resources muster a campaign against it?\nEven if they could, wouldn\u2019t a unified\nstudent\u2019s body echoing our voice be\nmore effective? Surely it\u2019s a bit naive to\nthink that we are perfectly fine on our\nown. Because once we are in trouble,\nit\u2019s going to be a rude awakening when\nwe realise that we are alone and without support. People question what the\nNUS has achieved for us. The trouble\nis, we haven\u2019t really been part of the\nprocess for long enough to see any\nresults.\nIt is a gamble, but it\u2019s not down to\nchance. If we decide to stick with the\nNUS, we need be proactive and not\njust sit back and see what they can of-fer. It seems that this referendum has\nbeen called as a reactionary response to\nsomething that hasn\u2019t gone our way. If\nwe keep up with these charades, Imperial will become known as some spoilt\nsport that throws a tantrum every time\nthe other player gets the prize.\nAnd then we might just end up tasting like Marmite.\n\u201cShould Imperial College Union remain affilated to the National Union of Students?\u201d\nNow you\u2019ve read the comment pieces, head to live.cgcu.net to watch last night\u2019s televised debate\nbetween members of the Yes and No campaign teams\nThen, from 17th June until 23rd June, head to imperialcollegeunion.org/vote to cast your vote\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n21\nFriday 13 June 2008 felix\nArts\nT\no continue on from\nwhat I started discussing in my column, art\nis a very vague term\nand can spark off days\u2019\nworth of debate as to \u2018what\u2019 it is. By\nsaying \u201cart is anything you want it to\nbe\u201d I mean that it can inspire, fasci-nate, calm, take you away to far away\nlands, save you from insanity, induce\ninsanity, provoke thoughts and de-bate, distract you, make you happy,\ndecorate a room, send a message,\nevoke memories and more. It can\ndo this visually, through sound and\nin writing. Art affects us through\nmost senses, sometimes through\nmore than one sense at once. This is\none girl\u2019s opinion. I was rather disappointed with the answers I got from\nmy fellow scientists. I was expecting\napoplexy or at least vehement reluctance at the prospect of being asked\na more abstract question, especially\nas I was disturbing revision for many\nof them. Instead, I was offered very\ncomprehensive answers from a couple.\nOthers gave pretty \u2018textbook\u2019 answers\nwhich were all very similar: art as a\nmedium of expressing emotion.\nThis common perspective on art\nmay be a product of how we have been\nbrought up on art in schools and how\nit is presented to us in the media? Although this is very true I would have\nto disagree as in many instances the\nartist has created their work solely to\ndepict beauty and not necessarily as\nan emotional outlet. Perhaps they wish\nto purvey a message. It surprised me\nthat very few people mentioned mu-sic, drama, sculpture and other forms\nof creative processes given that music\nis enjoyed extensively by young peo-ple. It was very interesting to see what\nthe scientists had to say in comparison\nto the artists. Judging by the answers\nit should not necessarily be assumed\nthat artists are any more clued up on\nwhat art is or how much they know on\nthe subject. My \u201cbest\u201d answers came\nequally from arts students and Imperial students.\nI would have to agree \u201cwithout a\nshadow of a doubt\u201d that Giger is a stupendous artist and has replaced poor\nold Vincent (Van Gogh) as my top art-ist. Giger is another multi-dimensional\ncreatordelvingintopainting,sculpture,\narchitecture as well as inventing new\nconcepts and ideas whilst managing to\ndraw in a huge range of admirers.\nIt was cheering to to see that a music band was seen as another form of\nart especially one that I happen to love\nand were innovators in their own time.\nPink Floyd pioneered psychedelic rock\nusing strange noises, experimenting\nwith the sound to create something\ntruly unique. Their philosophical lyr-ics, inventive cover art and impressive\nlive shows as well as the fact that their\nfan base is ever growing and spans\nmany generations only deepens their\ngravity as artists.\nEditor\u2019s Comment: Caz reflects on the census\n\u201cUmmm, what is art? Everything is art, theres a good one. My favourite\nartist is Pink Floyd, well its a band. Apart from that Patrick Demarchelier.\u201d\nEmerson, ex-Physics\n\u201cWhat is art? Something for the perception of the people who view it and\nan expression for the person making it. My favourite artist is Dali. I\u2019ve been\nto his house and really liked his exhibitions. I\u2019ve seen his work in lots of\nplaces where I\u2019ve had fun.\u201d\nAnne-Katharine, Classics Student\n\u201cOoh, good questions. I\u2019ll have to think about that because I have not\nengrossed myself in art for quite a while!\u201d\nMustapher, Physics\nHenri Matisse. His art is always so cheery and colourful, but\nvery varied and technically brilliant too. My earliest art memory\nwas seeing \u2018The Snail\u2019 \u2013 it was the first art postcard in my now\nvast collection, and I still visit it to say hello every time I go to\nTate Modern. \u2018Red Room\u2019 is also astoundingly beautiful. Oh, and\nHenri Rousseau is another fond favourite.\nEmily, Biology\n\u201cWhat the hell? OK, art is something visual.

It is much too\nvague a word and rather suggests I am\nnot quite sure what I am talking about:\n\u201cI like art\u201d. Do you really?! Well I hope\nyou do by now, especially if you seek\nweekly solace in these \u201carts\u201d pages. If\nyou do not like any form of art then\nwhy don\u2019t you start your own form of\nart: start a movement for which you\nwill be lauded in years to come. If\nyou are having trouble getting off the\nground then look no further than this\nweek\u2019s beautiful section. Inspired by\nThe Anti-Colouring Book, its pages\nfull of inspiration ideas to get the creative juices surging, we have dedicated\nsome space for you to let your scientists hand, hitherto clad, constrained\nand suffocated beneath nitrile gloves,\nmetamorphose into one of a creative genius.

If you have any\nback issues of Felix, I give full permission and openly encourage you to customise my centerfolds. I\u2019d be extremely\ninterested and delighted to see any\nwork you produce!\nAn equally non-descript term is \u2018artist\u2019. Sure, it gives people a brief idea of\nwhat someone may have done or does\nas a career or in their spare time, but\nnothing else. \u2018He is a cardiologist\u2019, gives\na huge amount more away, especially\nto those with even a slight knowledge\nof science and/or the medical profes-sion. \u2018Artist\u2019, gives nothing away even\nto people with reams of art degrees\nand experience in the world of paint-ings, sculpture, literature, music, dramatics\u2026. I think the majority of peo-ple, when using the dreaded \u2018A\u2019 word,\nmean is paintings and \u2018all that jazz\u2019.\n(Perhaps not the best idiom to use here\ngiven that jazz itself is a whole other\nart form). In my opinion, an artist is\nanyone who creates art in any manner\nof ways be it for their eyes only, as a\nhobby, as an outlet or as a profession.\nSomeone who transforms their anxie-ties, joy, happiness or grief into a poem\nis an artist. Someone who just feels\nthe urge to break open a pot of paint,\npour it over themselves, roll around in\nleaves and then video the whole thing.\nI have never known anyone to do this\nbut its sounds like great fun and may\neven try it. Watch this space for how\nthat went.\nThis week is designed to be a slightly\n\u2018lighter\u2019 edition for those, like me, still\nrevising (good luck) and for those who\nhave turned off their brains for the\nsummer period.

Bastard,\nI jest, of course. Ben is extremely tal-ented, although his GCSE Art grade\ndoes not reflect his immense talent\nand interest in photography (for his\nreticence in exploring his work in\nwriting).\nSpontaneity is how Ben works best,\nnot giving too much thought into what\nhe will capture and how he will carry\nthis out. And why bother when the results are so stunning.\n\u201cThe reason I like photography\ndoesn\u2019t go any deeper than me liking\ntaking photos of cool looking things. I\ndon\u2019t do it to express my feelings.\u201d\nThis is a contradiction in terms to\nwhat a lot of people think of art (see the\n\u201cCencus\u201d overleaf). And why should\nart always seek to capture emotion. In\nthis city of stabbings, LondonLite and\ngrime, it is glorious to behold something and just appreciate it for how it\nlooks. No thought about the artist\u2019s\nalterior motives and the message he is\ntrying to send.\nThe photographs of the London Eye\nand St Paul\u2019s capture London\u2019s beauty\nperfectly: and London does have beau-ty.

One of his\nfavourite places is the South Bank after\nsunset (where he has spent many an\nenthralled \u2018trip\u2019). A passion for music\nproduction fuelled by a love of clubbing has enabled him to exercise his\natility at capturing moments as the\nclub environment is ideal for taking\nin the contrast between faces and the\ndazzling light which illuminate the\nsubjects.

He leaves behind\nhim a very different College to the institution that he took over in January\n2001. This week, Felix examines the\nimpact that he has had during his time\nin South Kensington.\nWhen Sir Richard was appointed as\nthe thirteenth Rector, Imperial faced\nan uncertain future. Although IC was\nwell respected academically, and regularly placed second or third in the\nleague tables, College\u2019s finances were\nin a mess, governmental subsidies\nwere under debate and facilities were\nin great need of modernisation. College Council made the surprise choice\nof appointing not an academic, but a\nbusiness leader to take care of these issues and plan Imperial\u2019s future: Sir Richard, then CEO of GlaxoSmithKline,\nwas picked to take control after Lord\nOxburgh\u2019s departure.\nThe changes that he brought with\nhim were immediate, and his stated\naims were clear. Sir Richard\u2019s vision of\nthe future of Imperial College was of\nan internationally competitive \u201cuniversity business\u201d (as he referred to it),\na world famous centre of lucrative re-search, modelled on the biggest successes in the US. As these pages show,\nhe has more or less succeeded in these\naims: Imperial is now fifth in the THES\nworld rankings; the profile of College\nhas indeed been raised worldwide, especially in Asia (he even appointed a\nPro-Rector (International Relations));\nCollege\u2019s finances have expanded; outdated campus facilities are being refurbished and replaced; and research is\nnowImperial\u2019smainstrength.Butthese\nachievements have not come without price, and many have questioned\nwhether the direction that Imperial\nhas taken under Sir Richard serves the\nuniversity\u2019s primary purposes.\nSir Richard himself has been almost\nconstantly surrounded by controversy\nover the past 7 years, both within IC\nand nationally, due to his outspoken\nviews and \u201cauthoritative\u201d style of re-form. He has attracted criticism from\nCollege staff, academics and students\nfor his approach; \u2018absence\u2019 of consultation with the members of the univer-sity; his business focus (Sir Richard is\nalso Chairman of the \u2018Reform\u2019 think-tank: a lobbying group that pushes\nfor more private sector involvement\nin public services); support for top-up\nfees; and the magnitude of his salary,\nwhich at \u00a3348,000 is the UK\u2019s largest for\nthe head of an educational institution.\nTo get the full picture of the changes\nthat Sir Richard has made since 2001,\none needs only to look at the differences in College statistics between then\nand today.\nSince 2001\nThe most obvious changes that Sir Richard has made are in the student body\nand departmental research. It is in\naugmenting these aspects of the College that he has increased the income\nso greatly and safeguarded IC\u2019s financial future. However, the changes are\ndrastic, and have almost certainly had\nunforeseen repercussions.\nThe number of full time students at\nImperial has increased by 22% over\nthe seven years, from 9975 students\nin 2001 to 12129 students last year \u2013 a\nmassive change in number. In addition\nto this, the makeup of those students\nhas also changed drastically.\nIn 2001, 20% of full time students at\nImperial were Overseas students, coming from countries outside of the UK\nand EU. This was similar to the proportions within comparable universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, UCL,\nHarvard and Yale. Last academic year,\nhowever, the picture at IC was very\nSir Richard\u2019s impact on Imperial\nWhat has the thirteeth Rector of Imperial College done since he began his tenure back in January 2001?\nAndrew Somerville\nDeputy & News Editor\ndifferent. 30% of full time students\nare now from outside the UK and EU\ncombined, a massive proportion for\na relatively small student population.\nUK students make up only 40% of the\ntotal, and according to statistics, students from China now make up approximately 15-20% of the students at\nImperial College. IC now has a larger\nproportion of Overseas students than\nall of the comparable UK and US institutions by a significant amount.\nSimilarly, when we examine the increase in the total number of students,\nwe find that there are 2154 more students at IC now than when Sir Richard entered as Rector, but of these new\nplaces only 514 have gone to Home\nand EU students combined. The rest\nhave gone to Overseas students. Over\nthe last 7 years, for every Home/\nEU student place created, there have\nbeen more than three Overseas places\ncreated.\nThis trend is reflected in the balance sheets, and thus the financial\nplanning of the College. In 2001 fees\nfrom Overseas students accounted for\n5.6% (\u00a322m) of College\u2019s income, and\nin 2007 this increased dramatically to\n10.1% (\u00a356m) of the total income. This\nsuggests that Imperial\u2019s financial stability now relies almost twice as heavily on Overseas fees. This sum has not\njust been increased by recruiting more\nOverseas students though. The fees\ncharged have also increased dramati-cally, with an increase in the average\nfrom \u00a311,055 to \u00a315,427 between 2001\nand 2007 (compared to the average\nHome/EU of \u00a31,578 to \u00a31,894 \u2013 probably largely due to Top-up fees).\nHowever, this 22% increase in the total number of students is not matched\nby a proportional increase in spending on teaching. The number of academic staff has decreased since 2001\nfrom 3531 Full-Time-Equivalent staff\nto 3067 FTE staff. Similarly the average academic\u2019s proportion of teaching time has decreased from 22.6% to\nroughly 18.5% in 2006. This is again\nsignificantly lower than either of our\nmain UK competitors, Oxford (23%)\nand Cambridge (21.5%), especially given the distribution of teaching load per\nsubject. This is especially significant\nsince science subjects require far more\nteaching time than the humanities\nwhich will certainly affect the Oxford\nand Cambridge averages.\nIt would appear that our academics\nare, under Sir Richard, spending far\nless time teaching than they used to.\nThis decrease is matched by a massive rise in the average amount of time\nspent on research, increasing from 44%\nto approximately 53% over the 7 years.\nUniversity Total pay\nLord Oxburgh\n(2001)\n\u00a3158,000\nSir Richard\n(2001)\n\u00a3243,000\nSir Richard\n(2008)\n\u00a3348,000\nSir Richard\u2019s increasing\npay compared to the\nprevious IC Rector\nUniversity\nTime\nallocation\n%\nImperial 18%\nCambridge 21%\nOxford 23%\nAverage time spent on\nteaching per academic\nAverage annual cost of\ntuition per IC student\nStudent\ntype\nAverage\nCost in\n2001\nAverage\nCost in\n2007\nHome/\nEU\n\u00a31,578 \u00a31,894\nOverseas \u00a311,055 \u00a315,427\nWorth it?\nAs was previously stated, Sir Richard\nhas undoubtedly achieved his aims as\nRector of Imperial College, rebranding\nand all, but the statistics lend weight to\nthe arguments of his critics. Whether\nhis business-like attitude and focus on\nthe corporate nature of the College is\nbest suited to its primary purpose of\neducation and research is still very\nmuch under debate.\nFrom the experience of being a student here, and from the statistics them-selves, it appears that criticisms of this\napproach are valid. Students seem to be\npaying more for their degree, but receiving less and less teaching. The support\nstructures and social aspects of the College appear ill-equipped to cope with\nsuch a radical demographic change,\nleading to a divided and isolating campus which feels, to many students, remarkably impersonal and uncaring.\nWhat is certain is that the focus\nat Imperial is no longer on students.\nWhether this trend spreads across\nthe country as universities struggle to\ncompete for funding and elite status,\nor reverses with the incoming Rector\nand his more academic experiences,\nremains to be seen.\nThe 13th Rector of Imperial College London, Sir Richard Sykes, steps\ndown from his position in July, succeeded by Sir Roy Anderson\n\n"

Unanimously, we all agreed that\nwith its undeniably great community\nfeel, China would be the best country\nto grow old in. The unity displayed by\npeople gathering and socialising for a\nrelaxing afternoon was deeply impres-sive, and a stark contrast to the sedate\nsunbathers littering London\u2019s parks.\nIn a completely different setting to\nthe Heavenly Temple, was Tiananmen\nSquare. The square itself, I felt on ar-rival, had very little charm to offer\n\u2013 consisting mostly of a square block\nof concrete. But considering its role\nin Chinese history, perhaps it is more\nimportant as a symbol of Chinese\npolitics than anything else. From the\nproclamation of the People\u2019s Republic of China by Mao Zedong in 1949\nto its mass rallies during the Cultural\nRevolution, Tiananmen Square has\nbeen the centre for echoing the political situation within China. Of course,\nmost Westerners would now associate\nTiananmen Square with the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989.\nAs we approached the Square, we\nrather unscrupulously started placing\nbets on whether our tour guide would\nmention the massacre. I was somewhat\ndisappointed to find that no mention\nwas made. This shouldn\u2019t have been too\nmuch of a surprise, however, considering how well publicised it is that China\nhas attempted to erase this particular event from history. I had assumed\nhowever, that people in China were still\naware that it had happened, although\nit may not necessarily be talked about.\nOne person that I talked to however,\nstraightened my opinion on this. He\nwas teaching in Southern China, and\ntold me that out of his whole class, only\none of his pupils had any inkling that\nthe massacre had ever occurred. This\nwas the first incident that truly made\nme question how much of an impact\nthe Chinese government have in controlling their people.\nInterestingly, I caught an episode of\n\u2018Paul Merton in China\u2019 upon arriving\nback in England. In the programme,\nhe dined with China\u2019s top socialites\nand asked them about their views on\nfreedom of speech in China. They all\nagreed that China was a free country\nwhen it came to expressing opinions\nand views, but having just seen for myself something that appeared to represent the opposite, I was disappointed\nwhen the documentary did not really\nexplore the topic further.\nThe last, and the most stunning of\nthe places I visited whilst in China was\nthe Forbidden City. I had always associated the glorious palace with The\nLast Emperor (which I urge you all to\nwatch, as it is fantastic and one of the\nonly films which has been licensed to\nbe filmed in the Forbidden City), and in\nlife it is certainly as vast and impressive\nas displayed on film. Being the largest\npalace in the world, and consisting of\na never-ending complex of halls, walls,\ngates and courts, it is definitely one of\nthe most exhausting and rewarding\nplaces that I have ever visited. Sadly,\nthe only fact I can remember about\nthe palace from our tireless tour guide\nmight be classified as trivia \u2013 but it\u2019s\ninteresting nonetheless. The Starbucks\nbuilt within the Forbidden City in 2000\n(because there are not enough Starbucks in the world already) was forced\nto close down in 2007. I\u2019m not sure\nwhether I marvel more at the fact it\nwas allowed to open there, or whether\nit remained for 7 years. I\u2019m not going\nto comment that Starbucks is a symbol\nof capitalism either... happily though,\nit\u2019s now been replaced by a teahouse\n[it\u2019s equally out of place and overpriced\nthough! \u2013 Ed].\nSo, if one were to read my previous\nparagraph then perhaps you\u2019d be hard\nconvinced that China is a strict communist country as one would imagine.\nGoing back to my somewhat imaginary \u2018signs of communism\u2019 though, I\u2019d\nsay they are irritatingly strict on entry\ninto their country. Either that, or I do\nindeed portray a shady character and\nit has taken me this long to realise. As\nfor military presence, this was heavily\nfelt within the airport and Tiananmen\nSquare, where the surly guards and officers who glared at my friend when\nshe tried to ask for a photograph. As\nfor the unity of people: if the Heavenly\ntemple is anything to go by, then the\nCommunist party have not failed in\nthis area.\nMany people claim that China will be\nthe next world superpower. As the host\nof the Beijing 2008 Olympics, it seems\nthat China has announced its entry\nand role as a global first world coun-try. However, many questions remain\nabout how this will be possible with\na government which, to the Western\nworld, is still rife with propaganda and\ncensorship.\nIt seemed ironic to me that Starbucks, a modern symbol of capitalism,\nwas allowed to be built within Beijing\u2019s\nmost cultural site. At the same time,\nthe Tiananmen massacre of 1989 was\nnot that long ago, and seemed to be\nChina\u2019s way of telling the Western\nworld that the communism regime was\nto continue far into the future. My time\nin Beijing opened my eyes to question\nwhether a country which seemed full\nof contradictions could become the\nnext superpower. I would be really interested to hear more opinions from\nChinese people, as my views really are\nlimited. My belief is that it will become\nthe next superpower, although like the\nrest of the world, I am curious to see\nhow the everyone will coexist. The first\nstep, perhaps, is to see how the Beijing\n2008 Olympics will be handled.\nOne more thing \u2013 communism is\nnot the first thing that enters my mind\nwhen I think of China, in fact. The first\nthing is dumplings. Big, fat, juicy, de-licious, delicious, dumplings. Call me\ngreedy, but I could eat about 10 Jiaozi\nright now.\nThe Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests inside the Heavenly Temple Locals play Jianzi in the grounds of the Heavenly Temple.

The Rector described the difficulty in differentiating between students\nsince so many achieve four or five necessary A-levels.\nThe announcement was accompanied with a wider\nattack on the UK education system, in which he said it\nwas \u201cfrightening\u201d that 40% of Imperial undergraduates\ncame from the 7% of the student population that attend\nprivate institutions. He said that drastic action is needed\nto \u201csave\u201d the other\n93% of children\nwho are not getting\nthe education they\ndeserve, and one\nmethod for doing\nthis is to remove\nthese pupils from\nstate schools and\nthen put them into\nprivate institutions\nwith government\nfunding.\nI\nmperial\u2019s 14th Rector, Sir Roy Anderson, is due to\nstart his tenure next month in July. Felix had hoped\nto bring readers an interview with Sir Roy this\nweek, however, he cancelled at the last moment,\nciting his busy schedule travelling the globe saving\nhumanity from numerous diseases, and that he will \u201cunfortunately have to move the meeting to July, when [he]\nhas become Rector.\u201d\nProfessor Sir Roy M Anderson FRS, FMedSci to give\nhim his full title, is currently a member of the Faculty\nof Medicine, more specifically the Epidemology depart-ment. He graduated from Imperial with a degree in Zoology and after completing his PhD he spent much of\nhis early career working at Imperial before obtaining his\nProfessorship in 1984.\nSir Roy went on to work for numerous organisations\noutside of College, notably as a governmental advisor\nwhen he was put in charge of controlling the 2001 Foot\nand Mouth outbreak during which he controversially ordered the culling of approximately 6 million cattle.\nEventually, after a three year secondment to the Ministry of Defence as Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Roy returned to College as Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemology in October 2007.\nCompared to the current Rector, Sir Roy is much more\nof an academic, lacking the heavy business experience of\nSir Richard, but excelling in both research and academic\npolicy. He will have to quickly gain the trust of the student body and staff, following Sir Richard\u2019s divisive approach to \u201cthe university business.\u201d\nWith Imperial currently languishing close to the bottom\nof the UK\u2019s student satisfaction tables and widespread concerns that Imperial has lost its student focus and become\nbusiness-like, Sir Roy will have his work cut out to make IC\na more enjoyable place in which to learn and study.\nIt will be interesting to see whether the incoming Rector will follow Sir Richard\u2019s authoritarian approach to\ngoverning a university, or whether Sir Roy will adopt\nmore of a hands-on approach, engaging the College in a\nbit more discussion over its direction.\n\n"
