    "content": "letters\nSexually\nFrustrated\nDear Pallab\nHow refreshing it was to see\nthe cartoon on the cover of the\nCareers Edition of FELIX recently, it provided a breath of\nirreverent fresh air in this\ncommunity of rampant con-serva tis m. With this in mind I feel I must\ndraw your attention to the\ndrivel-packed letter of complaint you published last week,\nsubmitted, no doubt, by a sexually frustrated public\nschool matron under the pseudonym of J Martin Taylor.\nI found this letter extremely\nboring, and was offended at the\ncondescending way Mr Taylor\nattempted to reprimand the\ncartoonist responsible.\nIt is this killjoy attitude\npeddled by a number of morally\ndangerous individuals (Michael\nNewman included) against\nwhich George Orwell warned us\nin his novel 1984.1 plead to such\npeople to grow up and refrain\nfrom being such wet blankets.\nYours worried ly Alan Robinson\nPhysics\nConservative\nFascists\nDear Pallab\nIn reference to Martin Taylor's letter last week. If a government, which declares it\nhas already made the decision\nto shoot the unarmed Greenham Peace Women if they get in\nthe way isn't fascist then which\nadjective would you apply?\nMurderous, cold blooded, butcher o us and inhumane are a few words which seem appropriate. Yours sincerely\nNeil D Martin\nBiochem 3\nOpsoc\nvs Ents\nDear Sir\nI would just like to set the\nrecord straight concerning the\narticle in last week's FELIX complaining about the booking\nof the Union Concert Hall by\nthe Operatic Society next term.\nFirstly, performing societies\nsuch as Opsoc and Dramsoc\nneed considerable time for\nbuilding sets which, as anyone\nwho has seen one of their shows\nPage 2 \u2022 On HH BI will know, are usually of a very\nhigh standard. This work is\noften carried out at weekends\nbecause it is the only time the\nstage crews can get together for\nreasonably long, uninterrupted\nsessions.\nSecondly, prior to the article\nand after discussion with Ents,\nwho adopted a somewhat negative attitude throughout, the\nOperatic Society released the\nfirst two weeks of term and\nprepared to negotiate further\non the question of Friday\nevenings in January.\nThirdly, the productions by\nOpsoc and Dramsoc are regular\nfeatures of the social and\ncultural life of the college; this is\na fact of which Ents should have\nbeen aware of anyway.\nFinally, it seems to me that\nthe Concert Hall is entirely\nunsuitable for groups of the\ncalibre of B52s due to the size of\nthe stage and audience facilities.\nIn future, I feel that Ents should\nconcentrate on securing venues\nsuch as the J CR for most bands,\nwhereas the Great Hall is the\nonly adequate location for\nmajor gigs and I wish the Union\nevery success in attempting to\nreopen this venue for rock\nconcerts.\nYours faithfully\nClive Paget\nSCAB Chairman\nPS: I understand that Christine\nTeller has managed to secure\nthe Great Hall for two rock\nconcerts in February already.\nThe point is, Clive, that these\ngigs Christine has got permission\nfor are private gigs which cannot\nbe advertised outside College.\nThe Union has always been able\nto obtain the Great Hall for these\ntypes of gigs. However there is\nlittle point in getting the Great\nHall if only a100 or so people\nturn up-Ed.\nFreshers Eye\nView\nDear Pallab\nWhen I came to IC I expected\nto find a student union lacking\nthe usual stereotyped political\ndomination, a union concerned\nwith the more mundane interests of its member (ignorant\ntwit I hear you cry). In place of\nthis I find the place is run by a bunch of insular hacks who\nwouldn't take much notice of a normal student if they could\nrecognise one. I am dismayed\neven by the predictability of the\ncontent of your esteemed rag\n(and I dare you to print this bit).\nMost students I have met are\nmore interested in getting a decent degree and having a reasonable social life, so I don't suppose will see much change in\nthe usual sucking up to College\nby ICU hacks (people with a proven ability to cock up a piss\nup in a brewery). I doubt Ents\nwill ever get a group I have\nheard of and I predict UG Ms will only be prevented from\nin quo racy by RS M and the\ntrendy left squad.\nI note also you slag off Guilds\nfresher s b/iff ets as a fiasco\nwhereas I have yet to hear a complaint and felt they were a vast improvement over formal\ndinners. Are you party to a conspiracy to stamp out C CU subversion? I note a great\nenthusiasm to slag off Guilds\nparticularly.\nYours\nMark Cottle\nCiv Eng 1\nPS: Mike Stuart is a bit of a wimp isn't he?\nA wimp writes\nDear Pallab\nI was terribly afraid that my\nname might not be in FELIX this week so I thought I'd write\nyou a letter.\nLove and kisses,\nMike (Boy George) Stuart\nPertinent\nQuestions\nDear Pallab\nI would like to raise a few\npoints which I feel are relevant\nto everyone at the College.\nPerhaps someone in this College of ours can explain the\nreasoning behind them.\n1. Why axe the refectories\nunder the control of a certain\nperson? What I am asking is,\nwhy doesn't someone else manage them. If this happened they\ncould more than pay for\nthemselves by being a cheap,\nclean and having good quality\nfood. They would pay for\nthemselves because all students\nwould (I guess) use them.\n2. Why are the bars more\nexpensive than other UL bars (I know cos I 've drunk in others)?\nIf they were cheaper more\npeople would use them (I guess). Perhaps FELIX could\nhold a ballot to see if this is true.\n3. Why is the Bookshop not\ncheaper than other bookshops\n(which run to make a profit!)?\nWhy is its good selection of\nstationery so expensive? Is it\nbecause it has a virtual mono-poly, owing to its position.\n4. Why is the Southside\nShop so expensive. (Own brand\nbaked beans 16p from Sainsburys; only brand 25p from the\nshop) and poorly stocked?\nCan I suggest one thing to\neveryone. If you agree with me\nboycott these services. Foyles\nand Dillons and easy to get to\nand just as expensive. Bring\nsandwiches if you live out. Cook\nyour own food if you don't. Go\ndown UL U bar(10-15p cheaper a drink) at Euston\u2014really\neasier to get to. Shop in a supermarket (but not Europa)\nor if resident use your Hall's coop.\nIf you don't agree\u2014carry on\nbeing a sucker.\nDouglas Earl\nEE1\nSmiths\nMasterplan\nDear Pallab\nSorry to spoil a good story\n(just think of the headlines you\nare going to miss: Sherfield\nSplit, Smith Drops 5 Levels,\nCollege Secretary Encamped on\nQueen's Lawn) but my move\nalong the corr dior was part of\nmy own plan to achieve a cons old i a ted and more effective\nadministration while the Rector\nhas to devote a fair amount of\ntime to the Committee of Vice\nChancellors and Principals.\nThe only person who may feel\nsnubbed is my snob; I am not\nputting in as much mileage.\nYours sincerely\nJohn Smith\nCollege Secretary\nAll letters to the Editor\nshould be submitted to the\nFELIX Office (Beit Arch)\nbefore the copy deadline of\n1:00pm Monday.\nPallab Ghosh\n1Friday,11 November, 19831 I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022 Gaynor Lewis\nGaynor Lewis seems to be enjoying her year as President. She hasn't made any awful cock-ups; in fact she has done nothing this year at all!\nThe day-to-day functions of a sabbatical officer don't take up\nanything like forty hours a week. The sab at ical s are expect d to have\ntheir own initiatives and carry them through. Sean Davis has done\nthis admirably. He performs his tasks as Hon Sec competently and\nhas also rescued IC Rag from the depths of bankruptcy to something\nvery worthwhile. Meanwhile Gayrior spends all her spare time sipping Union sherry, working out seating plans for formal dinners.\nGaynor is possibly the worst President we have ever had in terms of\nnegotiating with College administration. A number of top people in\nCollege have intimated to me that Gaynor is very naive on College\ncommittees. These hard bitten professionals walk all over her. She\nhas already practically given away the Union Building and settled for\nthe cramped basement in Southside. The Southside expansion has\nnow become the Southside move. If you were expecting any\nimprovements in refectory services or better accommodation forget\nabout them for this year.\nThe last Council meeting only lasted half an hour. The members of\nCouncil were quite happy to acc\u00bbi. that i ayn or had done nothing to\nearn the \u00a33,000 salary she gets, .v lay be they'll take notice when they\nhear of the size of next year's College sub vent ion to the Union\u2014when\nthey hear that the grants of their clubs, societies and CCUs are to be\nslashed.

Ghosh\nMore exams at Primelia College\nYou may remember my friends Alan, Barry, Chris,\nDiana and Elaine who got their exam results at the\nbeginning of term. Well they've just had five more\ntests in maths, structures, hydraulics, thermodynamics and electricity. They were ranked from 1 to5 in\neach subject, 1 for the best, 5 for the worst. The\nnumbers of the ranks were added up, and the person\nwith the lowest total would come top overall. No two\nranks were equal in any one subject, and no two\ntotals were the same.\n1. Everybody came top in one subject.\n2. Everybody came fifth in one subject apart from\nAlan. Elaine came fifth in two subjects.\n3. In the maths test Elaine came above Diana, but\nbelow Alan.\n4. In one subject, they finished in alphabetical order\n(Alan first).\n5. In thermodynamics, Diana finished first and\nBarry last.\n6. Barry's total was 15.\n7. Elaine finished first in electricity.\n8. If the rankings that Chris and Elaine got in the\nstructures exam were swapped over, Elaine would\nhave come top overall and Chris last.\n9. Diana came second and Alan third in structures.\n10. Diana came fourth in maths.\n11. Barry did better in electricity than he did in\ns ruc ture s.12. Chris finished above Alan in electricity.\nWhat order did they finish in?\nGood luck, everybody.\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the FELIX\nOffice by 1:00pm on Wednesday please. \u00a35 prize\nfrom Mend-a Bike for randomly selected winning\nentry.\nLast Week's Solution\nI thought I'd been rather*hard on you up till now, so I decided to gj ve you an easier one. However, when I was making it up, I didn't realise quite how easy it\nwas. Despite gremlins getting in again and omitting\n(x+ z) from the end of the clue for 7 across, I was still\ninundated with correct answers. 78 people got it\nright and the randomly selected winner was Alastair\nMacleod, Elec Eng 1.\nAfter this puzzle and the one about making 82, I received entries from some people who claimed I was setting too many mathematical problems, \"the\nsort of thing mathematicians cut their teeth on\". This\ncriticism was probably based on the assumption that\nI am a mathematician, and though I proD ably am at\nheart, I am studying engineering.\nThe reason that I'm setting mathematical problems like these is because they're based on fundamental mathematics and more fun to do for the\nmajority of people then any puzzle based on principles of engineering. If those who think I'm being\ntoo mathematical would like to give me constructive\ncriticism, and say what they'd like instead, I'd be\ngrateful.\nThe answer should have been x=11,y=7,z=6.

What is left progresses\nsmoothly enough but is too\nbland, lacking emotional peaks\nand troughs. Oliver never seems\nin real danger, though Tim Curry\nas Sykes tries hard.\nAll the acting is good, as you'd expect from Eileen Atkins,\nTimothy West, Cherie Lunghi\nand Sir Michael Horden. Richard\nCharles as Oliver gives none of\nthose cringing moments you\noften get with kids on film\nalthough those looks of his are\nallowed to be too angelic. He\nnever seems real. Poor George\nC Scott's Fagin has been hammered by the critics, and unfairly.\nThey compare him too much\nwith earlier versions. Fagin is not\nreally an evil Jew (overplayed in\nthe past) but a kindly old man\ntrapped half-voluntarily amongst\ncriminals. Like Nancy, his destruction becomes a tragic mistake made by all concerned,\nincluding Fagin himself.\nForget temporarily that the\nbook Oliver Twist was ever\nwritten. Watch this just as a film.\nThen it has real merits.\nTony Atkins\nBullshot (Classic Haymarket) is\nexactly what it sounds to be\u2014a complete send up of Bulldog\nDrummond and Britain in the\ntwenties and thirties.\nBullshot (played by Alan\nShearman) is a clean shaven,\nclean living hero. The whole\npurpose of his life is to play fair\nand to fight for the British\nEmpire. The beautiful Rosemary\n(Diz White) asks him to help her\nfind her father. Count Otto Von\nDruno (Ron House) is the bad die they end up chasing.\nThis film is basically a good\nlaugh, an excellent spoof of those\nvalues upheld by so many\n'modern' Tories. Don't expect to\nsee much of Billy Connolly or Mel\nSmith (despite the posters).\nThey only make brief appear-ances. It's a pity that the film\ncouldn't have made more play on\njokes about the pointlessness of\nwar and so on.\nBullshot is enjoyable\u2014go and\nsee it, and remember the days\nwhen Britain was Great, men\nwere Men and the Germans were\ncalled the Hun.\nHugh Southey\nPage 61\nSpacehunter: Adventures in\nthe Forbidden Zone (various\nClassic cinemas) is a reasonably\nentertaining B movie made in\n3D, trying to mix Star Wars with\nMad Max.\nA mad scientist, Overdog,\nrules the plague-infested Terra\nEleven, and likes kidnapping\nyoung girls who are silly enough\nto pay his planet a visit. Peter\nStrauss, the captain of a salvage\nspacecraft, sets off to res cure three of the girls and collect a reward. The rest you can predict.\nThe special effects are average\n\u2014 flying vultures, bat people,\nmutant children\u2014and the 3D brings the battle scenes spectacularly to life. But it isn't all hack\nand slay\u2014the one notable character is Molly Ringwald who\nplays an aggressive but emotionally vulnerable teenage orphan\npicked up by Strauss to act as a guide. Even so, Spacehunter\ncost $12m \u2014at that price you\nexpect something more.\nTony Atkins\nThe Black Stallion Returns\n(U) at the Classic Oxford Street.\nOK, kiddies are you ready?\nThis film is a must if you're ten-year-old fighting for freedom and\npeace and love. I'm sure we\nadults have much to learn about\nthese ideals, but somehow it's all\ntoo phoney.\nKelly Reno plays the typical\nten-year-old, except he's American, has freckles and everything\nalways turns out just fine, so he\nnever has to do anything difficult,\nlike think. They only time this\nplot becomes interesting is when\nthe French Legionaire says to\nKelly, in his saucy French voice:\n\"If you were mine I would make\nyour bottom very sore!\"\nThe actual filming, however, is\nsuperb. The Sahara and Arab\nculture were taken in with a real\nvitality. The best actor was the\nBlack Stallion himself. This horse\noutdoes Lassie and Champion\nthe Wonder Horse any day.\nSteve Chamberlain\nNational Lampoon's Vacation\n(most of the ABC cinemas).\nFor some reason the producers of this film seem quite\npleased with their creation\u2014or\nat least their bank managers are.\nThe characters are supposedly an ordinary middle class\nfamily, only a little accident\nprone. When the father (Chevy\nChase) decides they are going to\ndrive across the continent from\nChicago to Los Angeles, every\nsort of mishap occurs. The result\nis mayhem.\nI felt this film never carried the\nindividual scenarios through pro-per ly. The jokes were well set up\nbut never quite worked.\nChristine Brinkley makes\nseveral appearances as a sex-crazed poor little rich girl in a red\nFerrari, and eventually goes\nskinny-dipping with Chevy\nChase.

    "content": "1ET Opinkm\nWRITE\nREPLY\nFollowing Neil Stewart's article on the case for re a ff tli a tion to NUS in last week's FELIX, J Martin Taylor,\n\\ former IC External Affairs\n\\ Officer and arch enemy of NUS\nputs the case against.\nTHE TRUTH\nABOUT NUS\nLast week Neil Stewart made an if m ber of claims about the\npossible benefits of NUS membership. In this article I have\nanswered many of the points he raises and followed this with an, I hope, illuminating description of what NUS is really like.\nFirstly, he claims that NUS has\ncut its bureaucracy since we left in\n1977. This may be true to some\nextent, but it has been cut relatively\nlittle. A reduction to 'only' 70 permanent staff is hardly a break-through. Large student unions only\nemploy this sort of number in\norder to provide facilities such as\nrefectories, shops, bars, etc, all of\nwhich provide real services direct to\nstudents. NUS still spends well over\na million pounds, the vast majority\non administration, salaries and\nconferences.\nHe says that NUS has 'disposed'\nof its large commercial empires. In\ntruth much of this empire, which\nincluded NUS Travel, NUS Marketing and Endsleigh Insurance\namongst others, went bankrupt in\n1976 due to mismanagement\ncaused by political interference in\ncommercial decisions. Endsleigh\nwas sold off and the rest of the\ncompanies were liquidated. For Mr\nStewart to write that NUS now\nconcentrates on influencing company policies and coordinating the\npurchasing power of students is a clever way of saying that NUS is\nincapable of organising any commercial ventures. This incapacity is\nsolely due to the political nature of\nservices\nbankrupt\nNUS, without which service companies could be successfully run.\nNUS has changed to a system of\ncompulsory election of delegates to\nits conferences, but there are still\nexceptions for the many small\ncolleges. And its unrepresentative\nnature is demonstrated by the fact\nthat 14 out of 17 executive members\nare members of the Labour Party,\nwhich even they don't claim reflects\nthe political views of students.\nFELIX \u2022 ^ \u2022 HM Thirdly, he talks about the expense\nof joining the NUS. No-one has yet,\nit seems, been able to put a figure\non what our subscription would be.\nA figure of \u00a313,000 was bandied\nabout last year, but Mr Stewart's 'no more than \u00a34 or \u00a35 a head' leads\nto a figure of between \u00a318,000 and\n\u00a322,500. If he is right (and he\nshould know what he's talking\nabout) this represents the total\nslashed!\namount of money that ICU spends\non C& GU and RMSU combined,\n. or our entire publications budget\n(including FELIX). It is half what\nwe spend on all our sports clubs, it\nrepresents the cost of employing all\nfour sabbaticals or half our permanent staff. Since it would in fact\nbe impossible to make the saving\nfrom cutting out any single area,\nand since approximately half of our\nmoney goes on fixed costs such as\nsalaries and insurance, short of\nsacking staff the only way to raise\nthe money would be by making\nsevere cuts of up to 20% in the\nfinancing of clubs and societies,\nand the CCUs. It is totally\nUnrealistic to expect the College to\ncome up with more money at the\nexpense of sacrificing research.\nThen Mr Stewart goes on to make\nextravagant claims about sums of\nmoney 'saved' by NUS for students\nat Lancaster. To claim each and\nevery Government decision which\nhappens to be of benefit to students\nas a victory for the NUS is arrant\nnonsense. There are many much\nmore influential groups when it\ncomes to education and welfare\nlobbying, such as the Committee of\nVice Chancellors and Principals\n(CVCP), the UGC, and university\nand college authorities. If they are\n\\ Friday, 11 November, 1983\\\nunable to persuade the Government to change its mind what\nchance has NUS got, either with or\nwithout ICU in membership. The\nHouse of Lords judgement on\noverseas, students entitlement to\ngrants was the culmination of five\nyears of legal battle brought by\nindividual students, and whilst ICU\n(and in particular our welfare\nadviser) was instrumental in initiating the process, NUS involvement has been minimal. Hk fails to\nmention the many issues on which\nthe NUS has totally failed to\nchange the Government's mind,\nalong with the other bodies mentioned earlier. Crucially, these\ninclude grants (every year) and full-cost fees for overseas students.\nImperial College has an excellent\nwelfare service and the Union\nemploys a full-time welfare advisor\nto help students get the most from\nbenefits like rent and rate rebates.\nWe have employed an adviser ever\nsince we left NUS, using some of\nthe money we saved by leaving. I am certain that one full-time\nadvisor working here at IC can do\nfar more for us than all 70\npermanent staff at NUS headquarters put togehter, and at a much lower cost.\nOf course our welfare service\ndoes sometimes take information\nfrom NUS publications. But to say\nwe are being dishonest and not\nadmitting we are using it is untrue,\nand it is not obtained clandestinely.\nMost of what we use is freely\navailable for purchase by anyone\nand we pay for it and credit NUS\nfor producing it. The information is\nanyway easily available from other\nsources if we didn't get it from\nNUS.\nThe provision of welfare information and support to College\nwelfare services should be the\nprimary function of NUS, but it is\none which it performs badly. To\ntake one example, the head tenancy\nagreements which result in secure\nac como dati on for several hundred\nImperial College students were\ndeveloped by our welfare service\nindependently of NUS. Being NUS\nmembers would not have helped at\nall since they have done no work on\nthis important subject due to the\nfact that they are politically opposed to private landlords. It seems\nthat NUS operates purely as a protest body with a complete lack\nof new ideas and imagination.\ntime-wasting\nrhetoric\nIn dealing with the points raised by\nMr Stewart I have come back\nseveral times to the question of\nNUS's political side. NUS is party\npolitical through and through. He\ngives this away when he says that\nNUS's proportional representation\nsystem gives one executive post for\none sixth of the votes, two for one\nfifth, etc. In order to get elected and\nget any real influence on NUS it is\nnecessary to have the backing of a political party, or rather the\n1 student wing of the party. All the\nj political parties have student\nsections \u2014 from the Communists to\nthe Conservatives. The National\n> Organisation of Labour Students\n(NOLS) presently controls NUS\nhaving won it from a Communist/\nLiberal alliance two years ago.\nWithin each group there are the\nusual factions and infighting. To\nlook at NOLS in particular, the\nfaction known as Clause Four is in\ncontrol but is fighting against\nstrong opposition from the Militant Tendency. Mr Stewart is a member of NOLS, the Labour\nParty and Clause Four. There is\nnothing wrong with'this in itself.\npolitics\nbefore\nbut can he and the other four NUS\nsabbaticals really be concentrating\non students' welfare when their first\nloyalty is to the political organis'ations which put them in office.\nThose who saw Mr. Stewart in\naction at Tuesday's UGM will know\nthat he is a very able politician\u2014he\nneeds to be, because student politics\nmakes the real thing look like a vicarage tea party. Against this\nbackground the five delegates IC\nwould get would have precious little\neffect, unless they themselves joined in the political fun and games.\nIt is evident that the NUS is\nfundamentally a party political\nfootball which, far from existing to\nprotect the welfare of students, has\nbecome its own reason for its\nexistence. Its activities in the field\nof student welfare are limited and\nare largely linked to the political\nviews of the controlling faction.\nNUS conferences must be the\nultimate in time-wasting rhetoric-hundreds of people meeting to\ndiscuss topics ranging from the\natom bomb to abortion, from\nSouth Africa to sexism, fr or n which\ntranspires absolutely nothing.\nYet I still believe there is a role for aN\nnational welfare body to help and\nadvise student unions. The NUS is\nnot going to reform itself, with or\nwithout our participation\u2014\nconferences don't vote themselves-out of existence. But maybe, if\nsomeone took the initiative, \\ a genuinely useful body could be set\nup without NUS's poi it cia l appendages. Such a body could perhaps\nmake a valuable contribution to\nstudent welfare at reasonable cost.\nIt is no coincidence that the main\nsupporters of NUS at IC are groups\nlike the Liberals and Labour Clubs,\nwhich are affiliated to the ULS and\nNOLS. It seems Mr Stewart is, with\ntheir help, trying to launch a carefully orchestrated campaign to\nget us back into the NUS. We want\nour' money to be spent on the\nbenefit of all our students, not to\nfurther the political aims of small\ngroups in College. In the interests\nof all our students we must reject\nre affiliation to the NUS.\nHM HH BBB HB I Page\n\n"

Two, IC\nteams took on sailors from as far afield as\nSouthampton and Burnham in races which\nwere as hotly contested as the final of the\nAmerica's Cup. The first team, under the\ndirection of Jones, soon had St Georges under control, sailing them convincingly to the\nback of the fleet in the first race. But St\nGeorges would not accept defeat and fought\nback in the second race to take a very credible\nfirst place. However the remainder of their\nteam were not given such an easy time and\nsome excellent sailing by the IC team soon\nforced the opposition into a losing position.\nSouthampton were given effective treatment by both Imperial A and Imperial l sts, with both teams beating the opposition in one\nrace. The match would have been more hotly\ncontested but for one Firefly with a cast iron\ncentre board which severely disadvantaged\none team. Imperial will prove their dominance when sailing at Southampton later in the\nyear.\nIC v Kings (Fencing)\nDespite laying waste QMC's swordsmen and\nwomen last week, IC could not display such\nverve and dash against Kings who fielded a strong team at the worst of times. Thanks to\nTony's father for presiding over the sabre\ncompetition, this meant that the usual fractious arguments about who hit whom, when,\nwhere, how and why did not arise and we set\nabout slicing one another up with gay a ban don.\nThe lady foi lists set about their task with\nthe raw aggression that make the normally\nstrong stomached individuals flinch, but even\nafter all the entrails and gore were swept away\nthings were grim for IC.\nThe first men's foi lists were also run\nthrough by the Kingsmen; but a ray of hope,\nthe second men's foil team had won and there\nwas reverie and joy in the IC camp.\nFinally Epee, which although took a very\nlong time to fence (the rest of both teams\nsensibly had adjourned to the bar so as not to\nbreak the concentration of the fencers), IC\nshowed a creditable performance, so all in all,\na good time was had by all. Thanks to all\nthose who took part and those who came to\nwatch.\nReuter\nIn last week's exciting episode, the captain ha toss. Read on, if you can\nA good start was provided by Eastland and\nHelsby (63), as per usual, followed by a fine\ninnings of 54 by Harlow This left IC in a strong position at 152-2 after 32 overs. The\nrest of the IC batting however lacked practice\nand the team succumbed to the Barts spin and\nwere all out for 186 in the 40th over.\nTight bowling by Eastland and Hobbs restricted Barts in their scoring. An excellent\nspell by Shaw applied a further brake but all\ntheir wickets were still intact and the situation\nbegan to look ominous. Barts run rate began\nto increase. A couple of wickets taken by Tear\nproved to be only minor setbacks, and the \u2022\ngame began to swing back towards Barts. An\nexcellent piece of fielding by Bostock on the\ncover point boundary switched the game\nback in IC's favour until a whirlwind 30 by a Barts batsmen (?) sealed the match.\nThus IC lost by 6 wickets, a margin that did\nnot reflect the true'nature of the match.\nWill the Umpire fart?\nWill Harlington ever be used for test'matches\nagain?\nDoes anybody care? ,\nRead next week's exciting episode of 'The\nCricket Club Saga'.\nCAN V00 SPARE\n\u00a39.50 FOR\nMY DINNER ?\nFELIX Dinner\n2 December 1983\n7:00 for 7:30pm Union Dining Hall\nGuest speaker: Michael White The Guardian\nALL WELCOME!\nTickets from the FELIX Office.\nUNION BAR\nNOVEMBER'S GUEST ALE\nBODDINGTONS\nTUESDAY 15 NOVEMBER\nBODDINGTONS PROMOTION\n50p/ pint\nCHRISTMAS HALL DINNER\nTuesday, 13 December 1983\n\u00a38 per head (student rate)\nDress: Dinner Jacket or Dark Lounge4Suit\nBookings open 12.00 Tuesday, 8th November\nClose 12.00 Friday, 2nd Decembejr\nBookings from the Union Office^\nFELIX I Friday, 11 November, 1983\nFree Theatre Tickets!\n\u2022 for\nOUTLAW\nMichael Abbensetts\n(author of Empire Road)\nTuesday 15 November 8pm The Arts Theatre\nGreat Newport Street\nLondon WC2\nFree tickets available from the Box Office until 7:45p Subject to availability.\n^ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Pago "

He\nalso spoke at length about\nsuccesses at South Bank\nPolytechnic and Lancaster\nUniversity concerning benefits\nand increased accommodation.\nHowevere there was confusion\nover whether the NUS or IC were\nresponsible for the recent legal\nvictory over fees for overseas\nstudents in the House of Lords.\nNo more\nkicks for\nthe pricks\nU GM Sketch\nTuesday's Union General Meeting\nbegan in traditional sham boli c style without any microphone and\nthe one which did arrive seeming to\nhave little effect bar lowing Chairman John Passmore's aggressive\nbark by at least 10 decibels (no bad\nthing) and raising it an octave. The\nnadir was an election for one\nordinary member of a committee\nnobody ever attends (Academic\nAffairs); particularly the obligatory\n'I'm not really a hack and now seem\nto be lost for words' speech which\nwould have been embarrassing if it\nhadn't have been so unoriginal.\nThe only other items of interest\nin the first half were the clothes\nworn by the second ers in another election \u2014Ian Bull (next year's President) wore the worst leather\njacket I have ever seen (at least\nthree colours) whilst he of the inane grin\u2014Mike Stuart (Guilds Pres)\nproved he had a revolting pinkish\nshirt (or should that be skirt) to go\nwith his dress of the same colour. I mean they made people with\n\u2022 College sweatshirts look cool.\nAt times likes this Neil Stewart\n(holder of the only noteworthy post\nin student politics never held by\nJohn Passmore ie NUS President)\nmust really have wondered if he\nwanted this College in NUS. We\ncan't speak, we can't listen and are\neven pretty poor hands with paper\ndarts.\nStewart literally wiped the floor\nwith the other speakers at the\nmeeting\u2014you may argue that NUS.\nis nothing more than a left-wing\ntalking shop but Stewart is more\nthan a match for any 'professional'\npolitician who has ever spoken\nhere. His speech is reported elsewhere but it's worth pointing out\nthat such rapturous applause\nhasn't been heard since the last\nTory Party Conference. And if\nStewart is Mrs Thatcher (no doubt\nSean Davis would be John Cole),\nthen who is dear old Cecil P? Perhaps the soon-to-be-married\nPassmore, a self-confessed\nbatch el or and damned fool.

A motion condemning US interference in Nicaragua was successfully\namended but Mines forgot to\nwithdraw it and in the confusion it\nwas passed by a small majority, still\neffectively in its original form\nalthough a note estimating the\ninfluence ICU exerts on international diplomatic affairs was\nadded. Negotiations with Mews\nresidents should now be chicken\nfeed after a move to much higher\nthings.\nThe pornography motion was\nalso passed (212 v157) possibly due\nto excellent pre-planning but more\nlikely due to a fluke. Before the\nmotions procedures had been invoked to ensure paper ballots for\nall the motions and voting slips for\nthe pornography motion were\ndistributed during the Nicaragua\nmotion to save time. When a RSMU amendment to the motion\nwas defeated they attempted to\nmake the meeting in quo rate by all\nleaving but as voting slips had.\nalready been distributed while the\nmeeting was quo rate, the vote was\nalso quo rate and the motion\n(against Pornography) subsequently passed.

A possible reason for dealing with\nthe matter internally is that the\nUnion is worried that any black\nmarks in Scotland Yard would\np red jud ice chances of future bar\nextensions in the JCR.\nAlan Larson, the JCR Bar\nManager, found the bar had been\nbroken into when he arrived on\nSaturday morning. The Police\nwere called in and fingerprints\nwere taken off the bar by the\nmetropolitan forensic team.\nIntially it was thought that the\nbar had been broken into in the\nvery early hours of the morning\nsince nothing suspicious was\nnoticed during a security check at\nthree o 'clock in the morning.\nHowever it seemed unlikely that\nanyone would take the trouble to\nbreak into the bar at four o 'clock\nin the morning, consume an\nentire barrel of lager and then\nsneak out again.

Earlier this year there were hopeful signs of the tea\nroom reopening, however negotiations between Professor Wood\nand Mr Tim Wilson, Life Sci Dep Rep, have broken down.\n' Prof Ronald Wood\nNO. 657 \u2022mna nm The tea room has been a centre\nof staff/students social life for\nmany years. Students were able\nto meet staff informally over a cup of tea.\nWithout this social centre the\ndepartment is blighted. The comfortable atmosphere that once\nexisted in the division has gone.\nTim Wilson said he was dismayed\nby Professor Wood's attitude and\nhe felt that the situation was tra-gic.\nLast February, Mrs Shirley\nVarey, a member of the division's technical staff who ran the tea\nroom fell ill. Mr Ian French, assistant departmental supervisor,\ntried desperately to keep the tea\nroom open by working unpaid in\nhis own time.\nThis attempt failed though be-c au use of the pressure of work on\nMr French and his volunteers.\nThis gave Professor Wood the\nchance had been waiting for. In\nan attempt to save \u00a32,500 he\nclosed the tea room.\nStudents and staff were united\nin their opposition to the closure.\nA petition was circulated and was\nsigned by over 300 people\nincluding every member of the\nacademic staff (except Professor\nWood) and the majority of\nclerical staff and students. The\nRectors Committee was approached and they supported the\nneed for the tea room.\nProfessor Wood claims that he\ncannot afford to keep the tea\nroom going. However the money\nneeded is only 0.25% of the\ndepartmental budget.\nMany members of staff, feel\nthat Professor Wood is bg ing| unnecessarily intransigent.

    "content": "We've Had Enough!\nConditions in one of the\nCollege's Head Tenancy\nresidences have deteriorated to\nsuch an extent that the residents\nare refusing to pay rent until\nsubstantial improvements are\nmade or the rent reduced. The\nresidence, number 6 Earls Court\nSquafe, houses students in\ndouble and single rooms with\ncommunal facilities.\nThe kitchen is infested with\ncockroaches and standards of\ndecoration and furnishing are\nvery poor. Paints is peeling off\nthe walls, the lino has gaping\nholes in it, the bathroom floor\nleaks and the furniture in the\nrooms is so bad that some\nresidents have thrown out chairs\nand beds. Redecoration has not\nbeen carried out for over three\nyears and two rooms in particular\nare un let table. The rent charged for these\nrooms is an ex h orbit ant \u00a327 per\nweek for single rooms. Number 6\nEarls Court Square has become\nthe Student Services Office's refuge of last resort where people\nwith absolutely no where else to\ngo are sent. The majority of\nstudents there are looking to get\nout as soon as they can.\nThe landlady Ms Seddon has\nbeen unwilling to spend any\nmon^y on the property, and it has\nbeen difficult to bring pressure on\nher to make imp or vem ents since\nshe refuses to deal directly with\nthe Manager Gary Turner or the\nStudent Services Office. All\ndefects have to be reported via\nthe Estates department, which\ncan involve considerable delay.\nSome blame clearly lies with the\nCollege who have failed to ensure\nthat the landlady carried out\nadequate repairs in the past. The\nresidents hope that by\nwithholding their rent they will\nforce the College to take\nimmediate action.\nFELIX Gets Results\nVictor Mooney, the Refectory\nManager, warmly thanked\nFELIX for bringing the filthy\nstate of the Union Dining Hall to\nhis attention. (This was reported\nin FELIX on 21 October.) Mr\nMooney was absolutely furious\nwhen he read the article and took\nimmediate action to censure the\nmember of staff responsible, a Mr\nParsons.\nThe FELIX expose of the\nSchool of Economic Science has\nproved useful to Geoffrey\nReeves, the Head of Security.\nThis group have applied to use\nCollege premises for their\nmeetings, and Mr Reeves is\nreconsidering their application in\nthe light of the article, which\nappeared as a centre spread in the\n21 October issue.\nEx-Head of Department\nHas Stroke\nProfessor Dan Bradley, former\nHead of the Physics Department,\nhas suffered a serious stroke. His\nsudden . illness has come as a shock to his many friends in the\ndepartment. He is paralysed\ndown his right-hand-side and is\nunable to talk. His condition is\nimproving daily and he is now\nable to get around in a wheelchair\nand walk with help.\nProf Bradley came to the\nPhysics department from\nQueen's University Belfast in\n1973, bringing a large group of\nlaser physicists with him.'He\nhad been Head of Physics in\nQueen's since 1966 and previously had lectured at Royal\nHolloway and Imperial. When he\nreturned to Imperial, he became\nProfessor of Applied Optics.\nThree years later in 1976. he\nbecame an FRS and also became\nHead of the Physics department.\nIn 1980 he returned to Ireland,\nonly this time to Trinity College\nDublin to a specially created\nChair of Optical Electronics.\nDespite RCS gate crashing the Brighton Run with Jez their\nvintage fire engine, Bo, Guilds' veteran mascot beat her to the\nfinishing line.\nBeing a race for pre-1904 veteran vehicles Jez could only run\nunofficially. Both finished in the first hundred. Bo, being a1902 James & Browne, receiving an official placing.\nPotatoes on the Brain\nRefectory Manager Victor\nMooney has got potatoes on his\nmind at the moment. Recently he\ndiscussed the high price of potatoes at length at the College\nHouse Committee. However in\naddition what has really got\nVictor worried is the number of\nchips being bought. As a man\nwho always has the interests of\nstudents at heart, Victor is\nconcerned that too many chips\nwill ruin students health. He is\neven considering getting the\nHealth Centre to issue a warning.\nPerhaps the Health Centre\nshould extend the warning to include all Mooney's food.\nNo More Sex Shows\nThere will be no more pornographic events on Union premises after the passing of the anti-pornography motion at\nTuesday's Union General Meeting. The motion was passed by\n212 to 157 votes.\nThe consequences of the motion are that no club, society or\nConstituent College Union will\nbe able to organise pornographic\nevents on Union premises and\nthat Imperial College Union will\nnot be associated with any\npornographic event outside College.\nAn ecstatic Michael Newman,\nproposer of the anti-porn motion\nsaid that the sight of the Miners\nleaving the Hall when they\nrealised they could not win was\n\"the most beautiful sight\" he had\never seen. The Royal School of\nMines Unidh will be attempting\nto reverse the motion at the next\nUGM.\nThe vote on the motion was\ncarried out by paper ballot.\nAllegations of ballot rigging\ncame from both sides since it was\nfelt that people were voting with\nseveral ballot papers. Mr\nNewman has lodged a complaint\nto the Union Honorary Secretary\nMr Sean Davis. RSMU officers\nclaim that the ballot is void if\nthere is any evidence of ballot\nrigging.\nThe motion on Nicaragua wa*s passed narrowly by 113 votes for\n'to 111 against. Union President\nGaynor Lewis will be writing to\nRonald Reagan asking him to\nstop US intimidation in\nNicaragua or otherwise he would\nhave the full military might of IC\nUnion to answer to.\nAnother surprise Was the warm\nreception accorded Neil'Stewart,\nPresident of NUS. Despite being\nelected on a blatantly anti-NUS\nticket, Gaynor Lewis Union\nPresident seems to be moving\ncloser to a pro-NUS stan fce. This,\ndramatic change seems to have\ncome about since meeting hj fei l Stewart at a weekend conference\nearlier in the year (nudge, nudge,\nsay no more-Ed).\nMr Stewart outlined the five\nmajor changes made within the\nNUS since IC d is affiliated6 years\nago.\nIn view of these changes Mr\nStewart felt IC ought to hold a referendum on re-affiliation and\neventually vote in favour.\nIn answering a wide variety of\nquestions he spoke briefly on the\nmoral obligations on IC to join in\nview of benefits we already\nreceive but primarily on the cost\ncontinued on page 4\nFELIX I Friday, 11 November, 19831 Page 3\n\n"

But it is impossible for a good band, and the Alarm are good, not\nto sell records and pack out venues.\nThe Savoy Ballroom (an annex of The\nBoston Arms) was packed out. Situated\nnext to Tufnell Park tube station, the\nBallroom, with over a thousand people\nsqueezed in, making breathing difficult,\ndoesn't quite fit in with the Alarm's idea\nof playing small venues. The room was\nvery reminiscent of the pill are dJ CR, though the higher ceiling allowed for\nmuch improved acoustics. A slightly\nhigher qt age would have been appreciated, too, by those at the front\nwho kept spilling over into the microphones.\nThe Alarm's use of Epiphone 6-string\nacoustic and acoustic bass always seems to cause trouble (like the almost\ncomplete lack of bass at the Lyceum in\nMarch) but the sheer en thus i a sum of the\nband and the way the front three (Mike,\nEddie and Dave) swop around on vocals\nand guitars and thrash the hell out of\nthem covers the finer problems with the\nPA and sound balance. All the singles,\nUnsafe Building, Marching On, The\nStand and their anthem 68 Guns, were\ncovered in the set, with the inclusion of\nthe poignant Tell Me a song about life\nafter a prison sentence.

Inspired by U2 (Blaze of\nGlory is dedicated to Bono) and renamed after the first song they wrote\ntogether, Alarm Alarm, the band has\nbuilt up a substantial live following supporting the Jam, U2, Stiff Little\nFingers and The Beat. Indeed, like U2,\nthe Alarm have been labelled as a 'Christian' band, but the title is as equally\ninappropriate as 'acoustic punk'. Their\nlyrics do show an obsession with conflict\nand the metaphors of war, though. Third\nLight is a prime example:\nSo here I stand, by your grave side,\n' The steel helmet lies upon your cross.\nThey say you died for King and Country,\nBut that's no comfort to the life you've lost.\nIn Across the Irish Border they voice\nthe futility of the conflict but carefully\ndon't take sides.

These\nobservations and the fact that London Cowboys are large in France (hit singles,\nalbums and tours) tend to make the band seem a bit of a laughing stock. I mean,\nwhat do the French know about rock'n 'roll\u2014even Plastic Bertrand was Belgian.\nSince the album is only available on import it is not possible to pass fair\njudgement on the Cowboys although reliable sources say they are good live.\nThe band have received a mixed reaction from the music press\u2014the Melody\nMaker recently raved about them whilst the New Musical Express dismissed\nthem as 'plain ridiculous' Given that most IC students seem to read Sounds\nyou'll have to make up your own mind\u2014and possibly see ex-Pistol Glen Matlock\nwho plays with the band.\nPeter Rodgers\ntheme of hope which runs through most\nof their songs:\nThe Power on the Right Side,\nFights the Power on the Left.\nWe have got to stand together;\nForget the East and West.\nAs Peters says 'With so many tribes out\nthere, all possibly afraid of being tolerant\nat each other, music can unite us. We're\nall on the same side, the government\nhasn't got anything real to offer. None of\nus are.of any political party, we just get\non with the politics of youth.'\nThe follow-up single to 68 Guns is\nrumoured to be Blaze of Glory and the\ndebut album is planned to be recorded\nthis November. With two TO TP appearances, a top twenty single and an\nextensive UK tour starting in January, it\nmight seem that the Alarm are on the\npoint of selling themselves down river. I hope that the process is not an inevitable \u2022\nconsequence of the commercial success\nthe Alarm seem destined to enjoy.\nGuy Riddihough\nFELIX\nDAVE SHARP EDDIE MACDONALD\nI Friday, 11 November, 1983 HB I NIGEL TWIST MIKE PETERS\n{Page7\n' r "
