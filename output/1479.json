The UK chief medical officer told us in 2005 that bird flu\nwould wipe out 50,000 of us Brits. And now we are all going to fry unless we recycle, turn the TV stand\u2013by light off, and use a bag for life.\nClimate change is a new religion.

People\nthat dare question climate change are treated like non-believers, in the\nsame way religions mock one another.\nYet there is ignorance about climate change on both sides of the debate.\nI bet Samuel Furse, supporting climate change to my right, regularly\ngoes to his local health store to buy organic nuts and dried fruit flown in\nfrom Brazil. And weather statistics can be distorted by either side \u2013 what\nif I told you that since 1998, the average temperature of the earth has\nshown no discernible warming?\nGlobal summit upon global summit is spent harping on about how governments need to unite to fight this problem.

They are effectively saying that they don\u2019t believe in any of it, but\nneed to placate the media.\nThe whole thing removes valuable resources from more immediate\nand concrete issues, such as people trafficking, developing nations\u2019 in-frastructure, and developing an HIV vaccination. Governments should\nnot pretend that climate change is a special case.\nImplementing a green tax is simply a political ruse to get more money\nwith minimal effort.

If introducing electric cars can help that, then excellent. I also\nlike to pay less for my utility bills. So if using less gas saves me money,\nthen great. And I understand the benefits of energy independence, so if\nnuclear power helps achieve that, fantastic. But don\u2019t insult my intelligence by making me pay more tax if I want to drive a gas guzzler, or fly\nto Hawaii, simply on the premise that it will delay the end of the world\nby another year.\n20 felix\nFRIDAY 21 January 2011\nCOMMENT\nComment Editors: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA\nlot of rubbish is talked\nabout climate change.\nA lot of work goes into\nthe science of climatology, and\nthere are a great many aspects\nto what this can mean. I am a\nbiological chemist, so I tend to\nstart from this perspective. It is\nas good as any, and provides\nan entry into understanding the physical aspects of climatology as well\nas the biological ones.\nWhat is undeniable about human activity is that it has greatly increased\natmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. The burning of wood, coal,\ngas, oil, have all contributed to this. The loss of trees and plants has also\ngreatly reduced an ecosystem\u2019s ability to absorb this excess carbon diox-ide. Although a rise in algae numbers might offset this, we are left with a\nnet increase in the carbon dioxide. Studies by Lovelock et al., quoted in\na recent documentary on his life\u2019s work suggest, that this increase might\nbe as much as 6%. This may sound like very little, but could have big\nconsequences. The hole in the ozone layer (now repaired) was caused by\na much smaller reduction in the percentage of ozone.\nLet us change tack for a minute, and look at this from another angle.\nGeologists have found evidence for several ice ages over the last 500\nmillion years. This we understand from three perspectives; paleontological evidence based upon the movement of fossils, chemical evidence\nbased on storage of radio isotopes and geological evidence based on the\ncharacteristic impact of ice on sedimentary rock.\nAll of these point to a cyclical change between warmer and colder periods on Earth. What is perhaps more surprising is that we are \u2018overdue\u2019\nfor an ice age, and have been for several thousands of years. What has\nstopped it? Well if we assume that an ice age has been prevented because\nthings have not been warm enough (controversial I know) we must look\nfor reasons for that. A small increase in carbon dioxide could well be\nit. Certainly there is plenty of evidence for carbon dioxide being a good\nretainer of heat. The atmosphere of the planet Venus is 96\u00b75% carbon\ndioxide and has a surface temperature of 460\u00b0C \u2013 hotter than Mercury, a\nplanet much nearer the sun.\nSo, there is evidence than climate change has happened, but that does\nnot necessarily mean an apocalypse. Of course we do not want too much\nheat, otherwise we would face a myriad of problems that might well kill\nus and quite a lot of everything else too. But, without warming, the Earth\nmight well be deep into a -20\u00b0C ice age today which would also kill us\nall off.\n\u201cPeople that\nquestion climate\nchange are treated\nlike non-believers\u201d\nCharles Betts Samuel Furse\nWe are told that climate change is the most\ndangerous threat to the world today, but as\nmeasures to combat it stall, the question is...\nScience doesn\u2019t play by\nits own rules\nHappy 450th birthday Francis Bacon! In\ncase you didn\u2019t know, it\u2019s thanks to him\nthat you are studying here, and that science\nexists as it does. It was he who said that\nwe should make observations and draw\nfrom them the physical laws which govern\nour planet. He also wrote that as scientific\nminds, we should work to free ourselves\nfrom \u2018idols\u2019, the social and professional biases which are part of being human. Our\nminds must be pure and rational before\nwe can draw accurate conclusions about\nthe world. The scientific method that we all\nfollow started with him. The problem is, he\nwas wrong about quite a few things.\nFirst of all, the scientific method doesn\u2019t\nquite work like that. Plenty of people over\nthe years have found fault with his \u2018scientific method\u2019, but it\u2019s not their birthday and I\ndon\u2019t have much space, so I\u2019m not going to\nbore you with their theories.\nNo, what I\u2019m interested in is the idea that\nwe can ever truly free ourselves from \u2018the\nidols\u2019. Many people think of science as a\nrational movement, uninfluenced by wider\nsociety. Scientists should be blind to race,\ngender and social status, and success in\nscience should be down to merit alone.\nI don\u2019t mind telling you, and I\u2019m sure you\ncan guess from my name, that I\u2019m a wom-an. There aren\u2019t many of us in science and\nthere certainly aren\u2019t many of us at Imperial, so try not to get too flustered.\nEureka, the Times science magazine\nrecently looked into why there are so few\nwomen in the upper echelons of science.\nIt\u2019s true we are under\u2013represented high\nup in most fields, but science seems to\nbe particularly bad. I can\u2019t believe this\nis due to being less academically able. I\nlook around my friends and I find women\nto be just as hard-working and intelligent\nas guys.\nDuring my biology degree, most of my\nlecturers were men. They shared ideas, collaborated on papers and went to the pub\ntogether. Female academics were few and\nfar between and didn\u2019t seem to fit into the\nblokey structure of the department.\nScience is an incredibly sociable field; we\nspend a lot of time working together in labs,\nsharing ideas in seminars and networking\nat conferences. Any scientific paper involves collaborations between several scientists \u2013 take a look at a report from CERN\nand you\u2019ll find it is mostly just a list of the\nauthors, with a bit of data tacked on the\nend. Scientists do not work alone.\nI think we are reluctant to accept that we\nmight not be a completely rational meritoc-racy. But before science can find an equal\nbalance between men and women, we need\nto accept that we are not isolated from social pressures. Sorry Francis, but we can\nnever completely escape the idols.\nBy Anna Perman\n\u201cA 6% increase may\nsound like very little\nbut could have big\nconsequences\u201d\n\n"

Now,\nfollowing weeks of street protests and\ncivil unrest, President Zine al-Abidine\nBen Ali\u2019s 23-year reign has come to\nan abrupt and unexpected end, leaving\nneighbouring Arab leaders fretting that\nthe contagion may spread.\nOver the last few days, in what is\nwidely being dubbed the jasmine revo-lution, tanks have been deployed to protect government buildings and police\nhave opened fire on protesters on several\nseparate occasions. Human rights organisations estimate that around 50 protestors have been killed in total and looting\nand rioting have spread throughout the\ncountry. In the worst incident, a prison\nriot in the city of Monastir resulted in a\nfire which killed over 40 inmates. The\npolice, who are generally viewed as\nlittle more than a corrupt presidential\nguard by ordinary Tunisians, have so\nfar done little to prevent the looting. As\na result, many local residents have resorted to forming ad hoc militia groups,\narmed with rocks and other rudimentary\nimplements of defence, in order to protect their homes.\nTunisians are unhappy about high\nunemployment levels, food price infla-POLITICS\nFELIX 17\nity over recent years has also made it a\npopular tourist destination. The current\ncrisis has meant that over 3,000 Britons\nhave had to be flown home and there\nare fears that the violence could have irreparably damaged the tourism industry\nupon which Tunisia is so heavily reli-ant. However, Tunisia has always been\none of the Mediterranean\u2019s more exotic\nholiday destinations, a fact to which my\nown experience bares testament. Last\nyear, I was travelling through the south\nof Tunisia, when the French tour bus I\nwas on was attacked. We had been driving through the desert for hours when,\nsuddenly, a large window pane came\ncrashing down and a woman started\nscreaming. Had we been shot at? We\nquickly tried to press ourselves against\nthe floor. It was a brick, and it was followed by a barrage of rocks and men\nchasing us through the streets. Fortunately, some impressive evasive driving\nmeant we were able to elude the attackers and make a dash for the safety of\nthe local mayor\u2019s office. The Tunisians\nwhom I later spoke to about these events\nunanimously shrugged them off as fairly\nunremarkable. They explained that the\nfrustration generated by the lack of employment opportunities available mean\nthat such attacks have become common-place, particularly in the underdeveloped south.\nNow that an interim government has\nbeen put in place by Prime Minister\ntion, corruption, poor living conditions\nand a lack of freedom of speech. This\nDecember, their collective anger with\nthe governing regime suddenly became\nunited following Mohamed Bouazizi\u2019s\ndesperate act of self immolation. There\nhave since been copycat suicides in both\nEgypt and Algeria, and an Egyptian pop\nstar has even written a song about Mr\nBouzazi\u2019s martyrdom.\nSo far, the international reaction to\nthe events in Tunisia has been, on the\nwhole, positive. US President, Barack\nObama, has said \u201cI have no doubt that\nTunisia\u2019s future will be brighter if it is\nguided by the voices of the Tunisian\npeople\u201d. However, Paris\u2019 reaction to the\ncrisis has been notable for its muted tone\nand the French government has come in\nfor some pretty heavy criticism because\nof this. The cynics argue that the French\nsimply have too many vested interests\nin the Tunisian economy and that this\nrevolution, reported to have cost Tunisia about \u00a31.3bn, is plainly seen as\nbad news for French national interests.\nHowever, the French could also be seen\nto have acted quite shrewdly. By showing few overt signs of support for the\nuprising, they have denied Ben Ali the\nchance of pulling a Mugabe and accusing the former colonial power of orchestrating the uprising by proxy.\nTunisia is an important trading part-ner, not only for France, but for the\nwhole of the EU and its relative stabil-Optimism among the trouble in Tunisia\nMohammed Ghannouchi, it is hoped\nthat the situation in Tunisia will begin\nto calm down. However, many Tunisians are disappointed by the prominent\nrole the RCD, the party of the former\npresident, remains set to play. Immediately following the announcement of the\nnew government on Monday evening, a\ncrowd gathered outside of the Tunisian\nembassy here in South Kensington.\nMedhi Boujomaa, an office worker,\nwho has been living in exile for over 20\nyears, said \u201cthe dictator is gone, but not\nthe dictatorship\u201d.

She said:\n\u201cBasically there are around 800 men in\nthe presidential guard who are willing to\nsacrifice their lives in order to prevent\nthe people of Tunisia gaining true democratic rights\u201d.\nYet, despite fears that some of the old\nregime may try and cling to power in the\nnew government, the mood of the crowd\nwas generally one of optimism.

Since deficit spending is\nlargely funded by issuing government\nbonds, the exodus of capital from municipal bonds foreshadows something\nmore ominous looming ahead for the\nsovereign debt market. The US Treasury bills, long held as the golden\nstandard in risk against which all other\ninvestment are measured, may suffer\nfrom a similar crisis of confidence,\nwith disastrous results for the rest of\nthe world.\nSo far, any newly issued US bonds\nwould be snapped up quickly, but if the\nappetites of big buyers such as Japan\nand China wane, the US government\nmay have trouble finding investors who\ncan stomach its national debts. There is\nalready a real possibility of an US de-fault, causing the mother of all financial\ncrises. With its public debt hovering in\nthe range of 14 trillions, the US is going to hit its debt ceiling in as early as\nMarch, accordion to the US Treasury\nSecretary Timothy Geithner.\nIf the United States Congress fails\nto lift the ceiling, he warned, there is a\nthreat of an US default. Similarly, the\nUS may also be forced to renegade on its\nobligations should it fail to roll over its\ndebt. While still a very, very long shot,\nit is no longer unimaginable. Moreover,\nit is becoming clear that the most likely\nscenario under which the US is able to\nhonour its sovereign debt obligations\nwill involve continued money printing\nand a corresponding depreciation of the\nDollar\u2019s value.\nRight now, it might be too early for\na verdict on the solvency of states that\nhave issued too many municipal bonds.\nSome, like Deutsche Bank, say that municipal finance stands \u201con the cusp\u201d of\nimprovement, citing signs of recovery in\nthe US economy. Since municipal bonds\nare strongly affected by macroeconomic\nindicators like GDP and employment\nrates, a rebound in performance of municipal bonds is likely if economic prospects improve in 2011.\nB\nusiness theorist Frederick\nWinslow Taylor believed\nthat performance related\npay was the way to encourage production and\nefficiency. Investment Banks have been\npaying bonuses on Wall Street and the\nWharf for decades.\nInvestment Banks are split into various departments: back, middle and front\noffice. Bonuses are distributed amongst\nthe entire company\u2019s employees - back\noffice accounting, legal and technology,\nalong with the Risk, Product Control,\nthe middle office coders, and the front\noffice business teams, research, trading and sales are all given a generous\nbonus each year. The people closest to\nthe money are given the most generous\nbonus.\nI once overheard a young lady saying\nif she got the same bonus the following year she would be able to retire in\nthe Hamptons. The following March,\nthe lady of Hampton wishes, was made\nredundant along with 40% of the sales\nforce. Bankers are paid huge wads of\ncash because they live on risk, and turnover can be high for many roles that\ngenerate this cash. If we are going to\nbash bankers, we need to know who we\nare bashing and how to bash them!\nIs an analyst programmer in the back\noffice a banker? I would argue not but\nmaybe he should be aware of what the\nwork he is doing is contributing to.\nMost desks at investment banks these\ndays are process desk, rarely is there\nproprietary trading occurring (where\npeople invest their own money for the\nsake of making money), especially af-Arizona has sold its landmark Capitol building to help repay its debts\n\u201cDeutsche Bank says\nthatmunicipalfinance\nstands \u201con the cusp\u201d\nof improvement\u201d\nter the Dodd-Frank act tries to deal with\nthis. It is far from brain surgery, rocket\nscience or any other intellectually challenging profession. The commissions\ncharged would drop if more could offer\nthe same services. Some hedge fund\nmanagers charge 10% of any return\nfor the money you invest with them.\nYet according to numerous academic\narticles and heuristic arguments they\ncannot beat the market.\nAccording to CAPM, a theory invented in 1961 by academics and an old\nequation, a stock will generate returns\nabove the market index in accordance\nwith its risk. Desks will use this equation to help product control understand\ntheir risk that needs to be clearly explained to investors in financial state-ments.\nIf we assume that government bonds\nare risk free, a silly idea if you are European right now, this would mean that a\nstock will return more than a bond over\na year in accordance with the company\u2019s\nrisk. But most investors know this well,\nor do they? Studies have analysed fund\nmanagers returns along with their risk\nand the evidence points to your average\nrich investor being better off if they just\ninvest in the FTSE 100 or leaving their\nmoney in a high street account. So apart\nfrom charity events and tips to waitresses do Fund Managers generate any\nvalue at all?\nIf this was common knowledge that\nmany more hedge funds would go out\nof business more quickly, not many in\nLondon would have survived the credit\ncrunch. The government is in a position of needing to persuade the public\nthat what they are doing is the best way\nto handle the bonus issue so that other\ncorporations and individuals don\u2019t feel\nthat they are being unfairly treated. But\nwhy not change the system and reward\ngenuine innovation and make the rewards more longer term? Quick solutions don\u2019t exist.\nIf an analyst creates a new financial\nproduct reward him; if a Managing Director cuts costs whilst producing the\nsame value reward him; but don\u2019t hand\nout bonuses to people because they generate above average returns for one year.\nThis encourages risk taking and an environment of cash grabbing. If employees were concentrating on their jobs and\nthe process of generating value instead\nof the end of year bonus there would be\nless risk, happier employees and a less\nemotive public gang of banker bashers.\nAt the same time, the corporate world\nand the public should realise that they\nwill be unfairly treated by bankers until\nthey understand what the banks actually\ndo.\nThe general impression of bankers rolling in wads of cash is only true of a small proportion of their staff\n\u201cThe evidence points\nto your average rich\ninvestor being better off if they just [...]\nleave their money in a\nhigh street account\u201d\n\n"

This however, did\nnot stop the team out classing their opponents who showed no signs of ever\nwinning the match.\nIt has been leaked that following the\nfestive break the squad met in order to\ndiscuss how should build upon the performances of last term. Various reports\nsuggest that the team are changing\ntheir training and the buzz word around\nthe squad at the moment appears to be\n\u2018standards\u2019 with coaches Brimah Kebbie\nand Richard Birkett introducing painful\nfitness exercises in order to trim down\nsome of \u2018the fat club\u2019.\nImperial arrived at the ground well\nahead of schedule and were warming\nup by the time their opposition stepped\noff the bus. Imperial took the initiative from the off with RUMS unable\nto handle the Imperial\u2019s attacks. Imperial broke the deadlock through fly half\nJames Hayward who cut through some\npoor defence with Max Joachim adding\nthe extras before stroking home a pen-alty. Imperial\u2019s forwards were dominant\nin the set piece although they were put\nunder pressure at the base of the scrum\nwith number 8 and stand in skipper\nCharlie Esberger and scrum half Olly\nCox constantly being scragged. Despite\nthis the forwards turned over RUMS\nball at the put in on more than one oc-casion. Added to this the lineout, which\nhas in the past proved to be an Achilles\nheel for Imperial worked well and Imperial were awarded a penalty try after\nRUMS persistently collapsed the Imperial\u2019s driving mauls off the lineout.\nImperial were reduced to 14 men just\nbefore half time with the referee judging Thomas Chavas\u2019 tackle to be illegal.\nImperial went into half time sitting on a\ncomfortable lead but knew that the first\nten minutes of the second hald would be\nkeen. On too many occasions this season\nthey have let teams back into the game\nafter switching off at half time. Coupled\nto which Imperial were a man down.\nImperial didn\u2019t take a backward step\nand continued to dominate their opposition pack despite Chavas\u2019 absence. The\nendeavor of the team was rewarded with\nanother try, courtesy of Ed Labinki at\nthe back of another driving maul. Labinski is currently scoring at will and could\neven end up Imperial\u2019s top scorer at the\nend of the season, a prize which a certain\nChris McGeough would be desperate to\nachieve judging by his touchline hugging appearances which have become\ncommon although were strangely absent\nyesterday.\nWhilst Imperial\u2019s forwards managed\nto subdue their opposite numbers with\nprop Simon Fenton winning the Man of\nthe Match award, Olly Cox was often\ncaught at the breakdown and was unable\nto provide quick ball as a result. Some\nsuggest that Cox may have let himself\ngo over Christmas and is a member\nof the aforementioned \u2018fat club\u2019. His\nweight increase may have contributed\nto his lethargy at distributing the ball to\nHayward.\nJoe Harris and George \u201895 kilos\u2019 Lane\ncombined well in the centre putting in\nsome good tackles but were not given\ntoo much of an opportunity to run. Louie\nBarnett showed attacking promise cutting through the RUMS defencive line\nand looked very quick on occasions.\nNathan Fitzpatrick rounded off the scoring for Imperial by grabbing the fourth\ntry of the match. Fitzpatrick surprised\neveryone, including himself, by finding\nthe try line. Toby Spittle played well in\nthe front row until Angus Tenison-Collins replaced him due to a dodgy shoul-der. David Wilson looked to enhance\nhis reputation as being \u2018the new Alex\nJohnstone\u2019 but his lineout throwing was\nperhaps too accurate for this comparison\nto hold true, despite Wilson maintaining\nfantastic chat throughout.\nOllie Benton provided an able replacement for Fitzpatrick and celebrated\nthe win by tucking into chicken drumsticks claiming to be on a new diet that\nis sweeping the rugby club by storm.\nPierre L\u2019Bour made his first appearance\nfor the 1st team late in the game as Kebbie used one of his now famous late tactical substitutions.\nThe victory was a mature performance\nfrom a team, which has not hit top gear\nyet this season. The attitude of the team\nwas epitomised by the Imperial forwards turning over the RUMS scrum in\nthe last play of the game.\nThe team left feeling extremely satisfied with their performance and a some\nof the players took to the social networking site Twitter to display their pleasure\nat the result.\nDavid Wilson\nRugby Union\nImperial 27 - 0 RUMS\n1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8\n9\n10 10\n11 12 12 13\n14\n13 14 15 16\n17 18 19 19 20\n20 21 22 23 22 23\n24\n24 25 26\n26 28\n11 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21\n22 23 24 25\n26\n19\n25\n27\n21\n18\n17\n16\n15\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 9\nSCIENCE\nFriday 21 JANUARY 2011\nJan Piotrowski\n450 year old\nBacon. Mmm\nThis weekend, it is time to celebrate\nbacon. When tucking in to that greasy,\nhangover-soothing fry-up, take a moment to think about Francis Bacon, who,\nthis weekend, is celebrating the 450th\nanniversary of his birth.\nSir Francis was born on 22nd January, 1561 into a wealthy family and is\nwidely acknowledged as the founding\nfather of modern science. Holding the\npositions of Attorney General and Lord\nChancellor, Bacon was undoubtedly an\ninfluential man. Yet he is remembered\nprimarily for his efforts to create a coherent and universal scientific method,\nchampioning observation as a central\ntenet to scientific enquiry.\nIt may seem absurdly obvious to a\nmodern scientist, but before it was promoted by Bacon, systematic observation\nwas not deemed important; scientists relied heavily on the writings of Aristotle\nto guide their theories that assumed a\nbase of ultimate truths from which all\nother knowledge could be deduced. Bacon saw this reliance on a finite source\nof knowledge as severely limited and\nhe suggested that theories should be\ninformed by observation. Induction,\nthe process of predicting future events\nbased on past observations, remained\nthe dominant philosophy for several\nhundred years after Bacon\u2019s death.\nHowever, despite his huge influence\nin creating modern science, Bacon was\nanything but a selfless saint. In a flagrant\nabuse of his political powers (it is nice\nto see that some things never change),\nBacon busied himself with multiple\ncounts of corruption after he fell deeply\ninto debt. Despite his close relationship\nto King James, he was fined \u00a340,000\nand spent several days locked up in the\nTower of London in 1621.\nDespite this fall from grace, Bacon\ncontinued to develop his ideas in writing and research until his death in 1626.\nIt seems rather fitting that the grandfather of science died by the hand of his\nown creation \u2013 contracting pneumonia\nwhilst conducting observations into the\npreservative effect of low temperatures\non meat.\nA London art gallery\u2019s display of a\nbrain removed from the dead body of a\nmultiple sclerosis sufferer has been attacked by Tory MP David Amess, who\nhas branded the display as \u201cdisrespectful\nand unacceptable\u201d.\nMr Amess, a Roman Catholic and former member of the health select com-mittee, said \u201cit\u2019s one thing if this is done\nin a laboratory, but it\u2019s degrading to put\nbody parts on display in a public place\u201d.\nThe display, which was inspired by Dr\nDavid Dexter, reader in neuropharma-cology here at Imperial College, aims\nto \u201craise public awareness of brain disorders like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease that affect a significant\nnumber of people worldwide, and highlight the importance of brain donation\nfor research\u201d.\nDr Dexter responded to Amess\u2019 criticisms last week in an article for the\nGuardian\u2019s website, in which he questions whether a similar furore would\nhave ensued if the organ on display\nwere, say, a kidney, rather than the\nbrain?\nDr Dexter goes on to say \u201cyou don\u2019t\ngo about demystifying the brain by locking it away in a laboratory, but by ap-Controversial battle for our minds\nImperial\u2019s Dr Dexter comes under fire for \u2018degrading\u2019 exhibition\npropriately involving it in widely accessible media like art\u201d. \u201cThis exhibition is\na bold step in the right direction\u201d.\nLast November, Dr Dexter invited artists Katharine Dowson and David Marronto to observe a brain dissection at the\nJoint MS Society and Parkinson\u2019s UK\nTissue Bank, of which Dr Dexter is Scientific Director.\nAccording to the curators of GV Art\nGallery, where the exhibition, entitled\nBrain Storm, will be on display until to-morrow, several of the works on exhibit\nwere made in \u201cdirect response to this\nexperience\u201d.\nDr Dexter is keen to stress that the\nbrain tissue exhibited \u201cmeets the strict\nguidelines that govern the display of\nbiological materials\u201d and that the tissue \u201cwas not altered or enhanced in any\nway\u201d. He feels that this is particularly\nimportant, as it means \u201cthe public is\nviewing exactly what the scientist has\nobserved in the laboratory\u201d.\nGV Art is currently the only private\ngallery in the country to hold a Human\nTissue Authority Licence for Public Display and Storage.\nHowever, this is not the first time that\nthe display of human tissue has caused\nuproar.\nGunther von Hagens\u2019 infamous Body\nWorlds exhibition came under fire in\n2004 when German magazine Der\nSpiegel reported that von Hagens had\nacquired corpses of executed prisoners\nfrom China.\nVon Hagens later obtained an injunction against this magazine, but he was\nforced into making the embarrassing admission that he did not actually know the\norigins of the bodies, several of which\nhe subsequently returned to China.\nThen, as now, the loudest critics of the\ndisplays came from Christian and Jewish\nreligious groups, who have criticised the\ndisplay of human tissue on the grounds\nthat such displays are \u201cinconsistent with\nreverence towards the human body\u201d.\nIn 2007, the Bishop of Manchester accused the Body World exhibitors of being \u201cbody snatchers\u201d and \u201crobbing the\nNHS\u201d.\nHowever, no such accusations can be\nmade this time round, as the brain will\nbe returned to the Tissue Bank at the end\nof the display period and its usefulness\nfor researchers will not have been af-fected.\nIt is hoped that displaying the brain\nwill help raises public awareness of\nbrain disorders like multiple sclerosis\nand Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nMultiple sclerosis affects roughly 1 in\nDr Dexter holding the MS-affected brain at the heart of the controversy\nAndrew Purcell 700 people in the UK, while Parkinson\u2019s\naffects 1 in 100 of people aged over 60\nyears.\nBoth diseases remain incurable.\nResearchers hoping to develop more\neffective treatments for these diseases\nare reliant on tissue donations, not only\nfrom patients affected by these diseases,\nbut also from healthy donors.\nThe latter are often in shorter supply\nbut are necessary for comparison stud-ies.\nDr Dexter believes that, as well as\n\u201cpushing boundaries\u201d, the exhibition\n\u201chighlights the importance of brain donation for research\u201d.\nHe says: \u201cArt has a significant role to\nplay in science as a tool for communicating to the public what the scientist\nsees in the laboratory, in a form that can\nbe understood by everyone\u201d.\nThus, it would seem that just as science and art, two cultures which have\nessentially been at war for the last half\ncentury following C.P. Snow\u2019s infamous\nlecture, are finally collaborating peacefully together, science\u2019s other great foe,\nreligion, has come wading in to stir\nthings up.\nIt is hard to see why Mr Amess might\nbe so offended when they, themselves,\ndisplay organs in their churches.\n\u2018Headache\u2019 by Helen Pynor; Amess\u2019 attacks have probably caused many\nFrancis Bacon \u2013 liked silly hats\n\n"

    "content": "FOOD\nFELIX FRIDAY 21 JANUARY 2011 33\nRussian Service or French?\nI PREFER ENGLISH\nBy Samuel Furse\nA good recent example of this is Nigel\nSlater, whose early life was dramatised\non the BBC over Christmas \u2013 arguably\nmore for the gay kiss than for the lemon\nmeringue, one might say.\nThe problem then comes with how\nthis is going to happen. You might think,\nwell, duh, cook the food and then dole\nit out. Putting together the flavours that\none wants to serve for various occasions is usually not transferrable; the\nway food is served at a wedding will be\nutterly different to that of a few friends\nat home, arranged at only a few hours\u2019\nnotice. Added to which, as any QI geek\nwill tell you, thanks to an answer from\nDavid Mitchell for which he was awarded \u2018Teacher\u2019s pet\u2019 in the \u2018Food\u2019 episode\nof series 6, there are two ways of doing\nthis.\nService \u00e0 la Fran\u00e7aise is the older\nof the two in western Europe. Various\ndescriptions exist, but it seems that this\nwas used for larger banquets and social\ngatherings. The food was served rather\nmore like a buffet than a sat-down meal\nat a table. Thus, in order to get one\u2019s\nchoice of dishes, and to get the hot food\nbefore it went cold one had to be tall and\nlong-limbed. Whether or not this was\nselected for genetically in any strong\nsense is unclear, but if it was it clearly\ncounted against the French aristocracy\nlater on, as longer necks are easier to\nguillotine.\nService \u00e0 la Russe is the one we are\naltogether more familiar with, in which\nfood is brought out in courses, one dish\nat a time. In company I find this too re-strictive. How often in a restaurant have\nyou seen a dish go past that you would\nlike to try? What about formal dinners\nin which there needs to be special provision made for nut allergies, fussy eaters\nor people who choose to be vegetarian?\nWell, you hope they would tell you in\nadvance but even if they do, there is an\nunfortunate isolating effect of a \u2018special\u2019\nOne of the things\nall the top chefs say\nis that one of the\nreasons they are in\nthe job is because\nthey like putting\na plate of food in\nfront of someone...\nmeal. I find myself wanting everyone to\nbe able to eat together on a level playing field. Of course we could go down to\nthe lowest common denominator and all\neat like free vegans but as that made me\nwant to reach for my gun, I looked for\na different approach. Also, would it not\nbe a bonus if they were able to enjoy the\nfood and talk about it at the same time?\nFood is not Granny-incest, it can be talked about without upsetting anyone.\nSo where does that leave us? We know\nthe disadvantages of service \u00e0 la Fran\u00e7aise, though it must have allowed 18th\ncentury French diabetics to fit in but it\nis awkward to organise food like that,\nespecially for a smaller group like a dinner party. I call my solution service \u00e0\nl\u2019Anglaise. I cannot be sure whether it is\noriginal to me \u2013 nothing in Larousse is\nsimilar, nor that I can find on Wikipedia.\nAs that gives pretty much the two ends\nof the spectrum for gastronomic reliability I think I am safe in presenting it as\noriginal.\nService \u00e0 l\u2019Anglaise is based on two\nor three dishes to each course, typically\nwith a theme between them. An example\nof a theme would be a flavour, such as\npaprika or Roquefort. It could even be\nsomething as simple as pasta, but two\ndifferent roasted meats served with the\nsame roasted potatoes and vegetables\ndoes not count as Service \u00e0 l\u2019Anglaise.\nAnother problem with weaker formats\nis that it is a lot more fun to do other\nthings \u2013 and gives everyone a chance to\ntry things that are different, as well as no\none being singled out.\nI designed the List of Comestibles\n(above right) for a dinner party at which\nI had Jewish guests, thus it needed to\nbe possible to avoid pork, shellfish and\nmixtures of meat and dairy products. I\nam reliably told that \u2018eating Jewish\u2019usually means fish rather than meat anyway.\nThere was also a cocoa issue.\nThe wine choice with this list must of\ncourse be in the proper sommelier tradition and thus go with the dishes as far as\npossible. I like chenin blanc, particularly South African ones as they are more\nacidic. This is often tiresome when taken alone, but with a dish like this starter\nwill be a valuable flavour enhancer. Additionally, fresher whites will go well\nwith fish and so this wine will also work\nwith the Kedgeree of the main.\nThe theme between the pair of dishes\nfor the main course was twofold. I put\npaprika in the rice of the kedgeree, and\nin the pastry. The inclusion of cheddar was originally by accident, but it\nWhen food has no meaning and gets you down, call for Uncle Sam (Furse that is, not the pointing chap with the hat)\nList of\nComestibles\nRaspberry Cocktail\n\u00a7\nTaramousalata, with Potato\npancakes\nSouth African Chenin blanc\n\u00a7\nBacon, Tomato and Onion Pie\n~\nSmoked Haddock and Paprika\nKedgeree\nCherry Tomatoes ~ Sweetcorn\n~\nSweet Peppers\n\u00a7\nOrange and Chocolate Cake\n~\nRaspberry Cake\nApple and Raspberry Ice Cream\n\u00a7\nWhisky ~ Disaronno ~ Port\nworked well so I left it in. Though the\npastry dish could go with white wine\nI think it works better with a light red.\nAnything too tanniny kills any subtlety\nin the paprika so an aged merlot or possibly one of the less fruity cabernet sauvignon is best. These can drift into the\ndesert course (avoiding the faux pas of\nopening red wine in the sweet course),\nbut the acid of the chenin blanc should\nhave gone by the time the mellow, peaty\ndigestif arrives. Lighter reds please my\nfemale Jewish guest \u2013 she has a liking\nfor red wine but not pork \u2013 so it was also\nuseful for the red to be compatible with\nthe fish.\nIt is fair to say that service \u00e0 l\u2019Anglaise\nis not necessarily easier for the host than\nany other way of serving food, but with\na little thought it means that you can be\nsure the food will not let you down.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE\nFELIX\n6\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 21 january 2011\nImperial students reject concerns about dr\ncause Imperial is one of the top universities [in the country] there\u2019s this higher\nexpectation of our behaviours, but in the\nend we\u2019re just students.\u201d\nThe Football Club Captain, Simon Kilroy, agreed, commenting that: \u201cIt seems\nlike [the Daily Mail] were surprised that\nstudents at Imperial have a drink.\u201d\nHowever, Professor J. Laycock of the\nFaculty of Medicine said that Imperial\u2019s\nmedical students had a responsibility to\nbehave in a professional manner: \u201cour\nmedical students have an even greater\nresponsibility [\u2026] than other students,\nin order to publicly demonstrate their\nsuitability to represent the doctors of the\nfuture, and to reassure the public of their\nprofessional behaviour\u201d.\nThere is a perception of medical students as being heavier drinkers than\nthe rest of Imperial. Despite not being\nshocked by the \u2018antics\u2019 described in the\nDaily Mail article, some non-medic students have described the drinking habits\nof their medic peers as more \u201cextreme\u201d.\nEd Lacey, Hockey Club Captain said, \u201cI\nsuppose the medics are a bit more extreme in their antics. Not every time we\ndrink do we get plastered, but it seems\nthat way with the medics.\u201d Tristan Collier, President of the 22s, a private social\nclub affiliated with the Royal College of\nScience (see \u201cDrinking Clubs or Social\nClubs?\u201d), commented: \u201cI don\u2019t personally think that people should throw up in\nthe middle of a bar. I certainly wouldn\u2019t\nenjoy having a beer next to a bucket of\nsick.\u201d Simon Kilroy agreed saying wryly \u201c[the Football Club] don\u2019t need buck-ets. I think our members can make their\nway to the toilets if needs be.\u201d\nMedics, however, rejected the sug-gestions. Professor Laycock said: \u201cI\ncertainly don\u2019t think that our [medical]\nstudents are any different from many\nof their peer group.\u201d Research from the\nHarvard Medical School, released in\n1991, showed that \u201cmedical students did\nnot drink especially heavily and were\nno more vulnerable to alcoholism than\nwere their counterparts in pharmacy and\nother professions.\u201d\nImperial College School of Medicine\nStudent Union (ICSMSU) President\nDavid Smith insisted that there wasn\u2019t a\nculture of heavy drinking in the medical school: \u201cA small minority of students do end up drinking too much but\n[\u2026] the vast majority of ICSM students\nare either moderate drinkers or teetotal.\u201d\nIndeed, many medics believe they are\nthe same as any other type of student\nin terms of drinking: \u201cI think the [Daily\nMail] article highlights a universal prob-lem, not just for medics, because everybody does it,\u201d said a Medic who wished\nto remain anonymous. Scott Heath,\nRCSU President, questioned whether\nthe article was bad publicity at all, say-ing: \u201cFrankly, it was nice for the media to\nfinally portray a part of Imperial College\nstudent life as comparable to that of any\nother university in the UK.\u201d\nPositive or not, the publicity has triggered changes at Reynolds Bar. Jugs of\nbeer have been banned and ID will be\nrequired at the door, a measure already\nin place at Imperial College Union on\nbusy nights, as well as at the bar. A\nMedic who wished to remain anonymous commented that the changes created \u201cmore of a hassle for the bar staff\u201d\nbut that \u201cpeople seem to still be enjoying\nthemselves.\u201d David Smith conceded that\nsome people would be disappointed, but\nsaid in an email to club captains that the\nchanges made the best of a bad situation.\nProfessor Laycock said that although\ndrinking \u201chas always been part of the\ngrowing-up learning experience [for\nstudents]\u201d that \u201ca more responsible attitude to drinking is to be encouraged.\u201d\nThere have also been attempts, successful whether positive or not, to change the\ndrinking atmosphere at Imperial College\nUnion this year. The new bar and club,\nFiveSixEight and Metric respectively,\nhave been designed to discourage drinking games. Ed Lacey commented, \u201cThe\ndrinking atmosphere at the Union has\nchanged since the refurbishment. There\u2019s\nless space for drinking games.\u201d Imperial\nCollege Union has launched a website\nthis year, yourlimits.co.uk, designed to\neducate students about the effect of alcohol and drugs on their health.\nWhether fair or not, there is a commonly held perception that Imperial\nCollege Union\u2019s Sports teams, and some\nother societies, are responsible for promoting a culture of heavy drinking\nat Imperial. There have already been\nattempts to change this perception;\nWednesday\u2019s sports night at the Union\nhas been rebranded \u201cBoom Box\u201d.\nJoe Harris, the Rugby Club Captain,\naccepted that there was a culture of\nheavy drinking associated with sports\nteams. \u201cTo deny that the culture exists\nwould be irresponsible\u201d but he denied\nthat it was unique \u201cto the rugby club,\nrugby in general or to Imperial.\u201d Ed Lacey echoed his sentiments: \u201cThe drinking\nculture is [...] a tradition for sports teams\nbut I would also say that it\u2019s a tradition\nfor students in the UK in general\u201d.\nHowever, Harris went on to explain\nthat the drinking culture may partly\n\u201cstem from the sport itself.\u201d He said that\na game like rugby is extremely demanding and requires strong bonds between\nplayers. \u201cSocialising off the pitch is\nincredibly important in developing this\nbond between players. Doing so doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily have to be alcohol-related,\nit\u2019s just convenient to do so as everyone\nmeets in the bar.\u201d\nof Gloucestershire were filmed taking\npart in a \u201cNazi-style initiation\u201d in 2008\nwhile a student at the University of Exeter died of alcohol poisoning in 2006\nafter a Golf Club initiation. Imperial\u2019s\nsocial clubs, which are not affiliated\nwith the Union and therefore not subject\nto their ban on initiations, have insisted\nthat their initiations are nothing like\nthose reported in the media. Tristan Collier, President of the 22s, said that their\ninitiations did not involve any nudity or\nhumiliation of any kind. \u201cWe take very\ngood care of our initiates and [we don\u2019t]\npush people over the edge,\u201d he said.\nDrinking games, forfeits and dirty\npints, seen as controversial by some,\nwere defended across the board. Lacey\naccepted that some people \u201cmight see\n[those] things [...] as unacceptable,\u201d but\ninsisted that there was no coercion in-volved: \u201cWe always take care of people\nand we don\u2019t force feed [them] alcohol.\u201d\nRahul Mudannayake, a steward at the\nUnion, agreed that the Union was a safe\nenvironment for students and argued that\nit was far preferable that, if students want\nto get drunk, that they do so at the Union.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather that students were drinking at\nthe Union, in a safe environment, than\nelsewhere where they won\u2019t have stewards looking out for them,\u201d he said.\nThe issue of alcohol consumption is\none that is under increasing scrutiny as\nthe government tries to reduce binge\ndrinking through minimum pricing and\nresearchers like Imperial\u2019s Professor\nDavid Nutt attempt to show the com-Drinking Clubs or Social Clubs?\nThe Links, Chaps and 22s absolutely reject the label \u2018drinking\nclub\u2019. The Social Clubs of the City\nand Guilds College (CGC), Royal\nSchool of Mines (RSM) and the\nRoyal College of Science (RCS),\nrespectively, all insist that drinking is no more central to their activities than any club or society of\nthe Union.\nThe Chaps Club refused to comment on who is allowed to join\nthe club, but suggested that the\nentry was based on involvement\nin RSM sports. The 22s does not\noffer membership to women while\nthe Links Club is open to men and\nwomen who are \u201cgenerally from a\nsporting background.\u201d\nThe common perception of the\nclubs as drinking clubs is primarily\nbased on the fact that they initiate\nprospective members. The Chaps\nClub refused to comment on their\ninitiation but Tristan Collier, President of the 22s, defended their\n\u201822-pint ordeal\u2019 \u2013 a term not used\nby their members insists Tristan\n\u2013 saying that \u201cthere\u2019s a tendency\nto [imagine] the worse examples\nof initiations where people are\nstripped naked and humiliated\u201d.\nHe categorically denied that the\n22s were involved in that kind\nof behaviour and said \u201cwe take\nvery good care of our initiates\u201d.\nJoe Harris, Links Club Honorary\nSecretary, echoed Collier\u2019s comments saying \u201cwe don\u2019t humiliate\n[initiates]. We always make sure\nwe look after them.\u201d\nThe Links and 22s emphasised\ntheir charitable activities; the\n22s raised \u00a31,600 for Macmillan Cancer Support last year.\nHowever, it seems unlikely that\nthe male-dominated clubs are going to shake off their reputation\nas drinking clubs, given that the\nmain point of contact that most\nstudents have with the clubs is\nin the bar. Interestingly, part of\nthe criteria for entrance into the\nChaps Club is that members are\n\u201ctrue and whole-hearted supporters of the Union Bar\u201d\nJoin the debate! Share your\nviews on this issue at\nfelixonline.co.uk\n...Continued from Front Page\nAll of the sports teams with which\nFelix spoke were keen to emphasise\nthat they are just as welcoming to nondrinkers as they are to non-drinkers.\nFootball Club Captain Simon Kilroy said\nthat most members of the Football club\ndidn\u2019t attend Sports night at the Union on\nWednesday while Bernice Cutler pointed\nout that last year\u2019s Netball Club Social\nSecretary is a non-drinker. While she\nconceded, \u201csome people at times will feel\npressured into drinking\u201d she argued that it\nwas a problem that was seen in many areas of society and wasn\u2019t \u201cspecific to this\nor that club, or to this university at all.\u201d\nScott Heath, however, was less ac-commodating, arguing that \u201cif you are\npart of a sports team that is renowned\nfor its Wednesday Night piss up it will\ntake a lot to say no their tradition.\u201d He\nwent on to claim that students had been\ndeterred from joining sports teams because of the drinking culture: \u201cI can\nguarantee that there are students out\nthere who have been deterred from joining teams because they want to avoid\nthis.\u201d Ed Lacey disagreed, insisting that\nnon-drinkers were as welcome as drink-ers: \u201cNon-drinkers are always respected.\nIt\u2019s not like you have to drink to be in\nthe Hockey Club.\u201d Indeed initiations are\nbanned by the Union and at many other\nuniversities. Students at the University\n\u201cWe always take\ncare of people and\nwe don\u2019t force feed\n[them] alcohol\u201d\nAll together now Imperial... \u201cLADS\u201d\nMarie Chkaiban\n\n"

We decided the tactic would be to get\nhim out first as his minions fall apart without\nhim. Things were working well as the first\ntwo games ended as draws, which shocked\nthe Minotaurs as they were the higher seeded\nteam! However, they pulled through using\ntheir greater experience and beat us in the next\nthree games. We felt it was a harsh result and it\nwas not without many contested decisions and\nMoore\u2019s usual whining. It is enough to say we\nare very keen to play them again!\nOur next match was against the eventual\nwinners, Bedford Bulls A. This was never going to be a good match and they whitewashed\nus. They put their two England players and two\nEngland coaches to good use! However, they\nare good lads so we still enjoyed ourselves.\nThese two losses made our last group game\nvital. To win would have put us third in the\ngroup, and put us into the playoff for the quarter finals. We came up against Underdodge A,\nfrom Oxford, and comfortably won 4-1.\nOur playoff was against the Bedford Bulls\nMixed and from this point on we were playing a knockout competition which was best of\nfive games. We again put in an efficient performance and thrashed them 3-0.\nThis win guaranteed us a top eight finish and\nput us through to the quarters against the NCD\nHighwaymen. NCD are currently top of the\nSouthern Conference and on the day had not\nlost even a single game in four matches! We\nweren\u2019t expecting to win by any means, but we\nsure gave them a good run for their money in\nan exciting match. They took the first game by\na narrow two players to one, which already had\nthem looking concerned, and then we went on\nto win the second game! Now they were fo-cused! We continued to play some of our best\ndodgeball of the day with Adam Cutmore making a vital contribution with monster catches\nand Tom Peake making superb use of his counter attacking ability. Alas, it was not to be our\nday and NCD edged the next two games for\nthe 3-1 win. We all felt very hard done by but\nconceded that we had played a lot better than\nexpected and lost to worthy opponents (the\neventual runners-up whose team included an\nEngland player and the England head coach).\nIn the end, we went home with our heads held\nhigh and we now move up to fourth place in the\nSouthern Conference league! Our next tournament is at Winchester University and it is the\nqualifier for the University Cup.\n...Continued From Back Page\nDon\u2019t extend College hours\nI\nt appears that the College has yet again\ntaken a somewhat narrow-minded view\non their latest venture, extending the\nworking day for not only the students,\nbut the staff as well. Forget the fact that\nthey will have to ask staff to work longer hours,\nwhich might be a whole other bag of problems,\nbut the change to the timetable would eat into\nthe already limited hours available for extracurricular activities, in particular sports.\nAlthough some might find Imperial\u2019s location within London an advantage, for the sports\nteams it can be a big problem, especially those\nwho need large open spaces to practice. Even\nthough Hyde Park is across the road and there\nis a public area for playing sports, I somewhat\ndoubt that the general public would appreciate\nhaving 50 or so rugby players running up and\ndown the grass, shredding the ground to pieces.\nNor would they probably appreciate Lacrosse\nplayers flinging their balls around whilst children try to play peacefully in the park (yes I do\nrealise how dirty that sounds). On top of that,\nwe would need to find room for the footballers.\nIn short, although Hyde Park would be an ideal\nlocation, it is not possible to have the teams\nthere, which is why they train out at Harlington.\nThat in itself is a problem; the sheer distance\nto the grounds and the added costs of transport\nhas meant that some of the sports teams have\nthe highest budgets and travel expenses of the\nclubs and societies at Imperial. Take a typical\ntraining session, which would last 90 minutes\nor so. If you leave the Union at 18:00, you\nwould not get back to the Union until close to\n22:00, then you still have to get home. Training\nduring the lunch hours would be a possible so-lution, but again there is the problem of using\nHyde Park and the fact that humanities run during lunch. There simply isn\u2019t enough time, nor\nenough space, for all the outdoor sports teams\nto train at Harlington. Some have moved their\ntraining sessions to other grounds, some have\nmoved them to Tuesday nights, but for most,\nhaving a big training session the night before\na BUCS game on a Wednesday is just not fea-sible.\nSo what are the other options? Well you\ncould train on a Thursday, but as already men-tioned, this is the day after a game, not the ideal\ntime to improve on your performance for the\nfollowing weeks game. Friday night? Well we\nall know that just won\u2019t be a popular decision\nfor the players! Extending the College hours\nto 19:00 on a Monday and Thursday will just\nmake it that much more difficult for sports\nteams to function effectively.\nThere are some clubs that have tried training\non a Saturday, however, for most, Saturdays and\nSundays are when University of London (ULU)\ngames are played. For the indoor teams, these\ngames are also played on a Monday night! Yes,\nalthough sports such as netball, badminton and\nsquash don\u2019t have to travel that far to get to their\ntraining sessions, it means that having ULU fixtures on a Monday evening are feasible. Extending the hours would have a huge impact on the\ntimetabling of these fixtures, especially if you\nhave to travel to Royal Holloway.\nThe simple argument for the sports teams\nwould have to be that extending the hours to\n19:00 would be detrimental to the effective\nrunning of their club and by extension, the experience of the students whilst at University.\nPlayers already struggle to find enough hours\nto complete their work and fit in all the training\nwithout taking out an extra hour in the evenings\n\u2013 which, if the College were so determined to\ngo ahead with, would leave them with only\none viable alternative; an early start during the\nweek. But how many people are actually going\nto make it to a 08:00 lecture, staff included?\nJovan Nedic argues that the proposed timetable changes\nwould adversely affect Imperial\u2019s sports teams\n\u201cThere simply wouldn\u2019t\nbe enough time, nor\nenough space, for all the\noutdoor sports teams to\ntrain at Harlington\u201d\nMasterCard excel at subtle advertising\n\n"

Imagine getting to see The Arcade\nFire, Crystal Castles, Animal Collective, Robyn,\nTitus Andronicus, The National, Cee-Lo, HEALTH,\nThe Kills, The Black Keys, The Chemical Brothers... and Kanye Motherfriggin\u2019 West all in the same\nplace. Add to that bolting up-and-commers like Odd\nFuture and the long awaited return of The Strokes\nand you\u2019ve got a line-up to die for. There\u2019s a surprise\ntoo: a set by lords of noise Death From Above 1979,\nreuniting for the event. Greg Power\nT\nucked away down side streets, in\nbasements and attics away from\nthe crowds, small gig venues give\nyou the opportunity to see the\nbands that will be playing the big\nvenues in a year or two\u2019s time up close and personal at a fraction of the price. Here are a few\nof the best ones:\nThe Social:\n5 Little Portland Street\nTucked away in a little backstreet off Oxford\nStreet, The Social is a tiny venue with an upstairs diner bar area where you can chill out to\nthe Rough Trade powered jukebox and stuff\nyour face with their pies or fish finger sand-wiches. Heading down stairs, there\u2019s a concrete nuclear bunker feel to the gig venue - the\napocalypse could happen outside and the gig\nwould carry on obliviously. There are tables\nand benches leading along the sides up to the\nstage, so you can grab a seat and enjoy the gig\nwith a nice pint of their Kopparberg Cider. This\nis a great venue for free gigs - last yearAlt.

This is why we are inviting you\nto come check out 19.02, the first Felix Music\nNight.\nWe have some great performances lined up\nfor you, and with the variety of acts on the\nbill we can guarantee there will be at least one\ngroup that will tickle your fancy.\nOver the next four issues we\u2019ll be presenting\nthe people who will be performing at 19.02 and\nreviewing some of their performances around\nLondon as we build up to the event. We begin\nnext week with an interview of alt-rockers The\nVetoes, the night\u2019s headliners.\nSo keep checking the Music pages, and look\nout for the nifty posters around campus, featuring a sick design by Luke Tomlin.\n19.02\nMetric (ICU)\nFebruary 19th 2011\nFelix Music Editors\nBuffalo Bar:\n251 Upper Street, Islington\nDown in the basement beneath a pub called\n\u201cThe Famous Cock\u201d, the tiny 150 capacity\nBuffalo Bar is one of the focuses of London\u2019s\nIndie Pop scene.

    "content": "19\nfelix FRIDAY 21 january 2011\nCOMMENT\nF\nor a long time, I\u2019ve tried to\nlive life in the fast lane \u2013\neven occasionally overtaking on the central reservation\n\u2013 but it\u2019s only recently that\nI\u2019ve come to realise why.\nEven when I was young, my parents\nwould complain that I had ants in my\npants. Apart from a rather unfortunate\npicnic, that wasn\u2019t literally true, but I\nalways had to keep moving. In college,\nout of college, even when I\u2019m home, I\njust don\u2019t feel right unless I\u2019m doing\nsomething. As a consequence, I have an\nembarrassingly clean room. The really\nlurid secret is that I intentionally make\na mess of it just so I can tidy up again.\nAt first, I thought I had been drugged.\nI feared someone had swapped my Canderel tablets for ProPlus pills. It was\nonly after I added them to my double\nexpresso, and my heart didn\u2019t explode\nthat I realised that I was safe. I didn\u2019t\nsleep for a week but at least I was alive.\nNext, I considered that maybe it was\njust a natural reaction. This world of\nours is chock\u2013full of so many awesome\nand amazing things and, given the finite\namount of time that I have, I can\u2019t af-Rhys Davies\nford to stop and smell the roses. I like\nto procrastinate in reverse \u2013 why do today what you could\u2019ve done yesterday.\nEven in my pitifully small corner of the\ncosmos, there are so many interesting\nthings to see and do that it would be a\nwaste to let any of them slip by.\nBut that isn\u2019t quite the whole of it.\nThere was one day last term where it\nfinally clicked. Here is how I remember\nit. It starts at 7am with a morning full of\nmedical student stuff \u2013 taking histories,\ndrawing blood, avoiding Daily Mail re-porters, then lunch with my girlfriend.\nBack to campus where I plaster everything that doesn\u2019t move with posters for\nan upcoming event, dipping in and out\nof the library as I do so. Afterwards, I\ngo to the gym to pump my (negligible)\nguns. I finally go home at 8pm, but still\nno rest for the wicked \u2013 or me. I help my\nhouse\u2013mate prepare for a small group\npresentation. When he goes to write up,\nI ring home. Something of a mistake \u2013\nmy Mum could talk the hind legs off 2.3\nmetric Blackpools of donkeys. At 11pm,\nI finally sit down to dinner but my day\nis still not over \u2013 I still have an article\nto write for Felix and there is a rather\nimmediate deadline looming. I sit down,\ndo the research and write the piece until\n2am.\nQuite a full day by anyone\u2019s measure.\nI have enjoyed every minute but it\u2019s finally time for sleep. I\u2019m just about to\nbed down with my nightcap and a glass\nof warm milk when something ticks\nover in my mind. It\u2019s bin day tomorrow.\nWearily, I trudge downstairs and out into\nthe back garden to empty the bins.\nAnd I stop.\nIt\u2019s a clear night and the moon is full.\nThe air is still and it seems like the whole\nworld is quiet. The black bags and I are\nbathed in moonlight and I am genuinely\nawestruck by the serenity and stillness\nof the moment. It\u2019s beautiful.\nThis is why I run up escalators. This\nis why I eat lunch standing up. This is\nwhy I appear in photos as a vague Rhys\u2013\nshaped blur. It\u2019s because in the constant\nbuzz, the triumphant brass band, of the\n25 hour life, it is easy to forget that you\nhave the option to just\u2026stop.\nI highly recommend you try it some\ntime. Take five minutes out of your\nbusy schedules and enjoy a little slice of\ntranquillity.\nT\nhe television licensing\npeople and I are playing\na game. The rules of the\ngame are pretty simple. The\nfirst player \u2013 that\u2019s me \u2013\nabides by all known laws this side of the\nMars\u2013Jupiter asteroid belt. The second\nplayer \u2013 Grand Duke John Hales of the\nLondon South West Enforcement Division \u2013 simply has to send a letter to me\nevery month asking if I\u2019ve broken any\nlaws yet. Simple game.\nMr. Hale\u2019s opening gambit this week\nwas the TV Licensing equivalent of the\n\u201cWhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d\nposer: a letter expressing a desire for\nme to \u201chave the information you may\nneed before a hearing is set at your local court\u201d. Is this a cheap way for Angry\nGeek to boost his ratings, with a quick\nlegal battle to sell to the tabloids? Of\ncourse it\u2019s bloody not. I\u2019m not going to\ncourt, is why.\nThe letter is full of the most exquisite\nwording, with all the subtlety of an elephant\u2013based strip parlour operating\nunderneath a nunnery. But not once does\nit say that I\u2019m going to court, of course.\nIt\u2019s just a friendly factbook should that\nhappen, complete with info on what I\ncan take into court. If you\u2019re wondering what these tips consist of, it\u2019s things\nlike \u201cYou can take a lawyer in to court!\u201d\nAngry Geek\nand \u201cThe chap in the funny wig is the\nboss man!\u201d, all bullet\u2013pointed and reading like hints from a video game load\nscreen. All it\u2019s missing is a little stick-man rendition of Deputy Chief Admiral\nOf Pain John Hales, pointing towards\nthe words \u2018court\u2019 and \u2018enforcement\u2019 and\nwinking at the reader. Maybe a speech\nbubble insinuating something about\n\u2018accidents\u2019.\nI don\u2019t watch television. I don\u2019t watch\ntelevision because even if it wasn\u2019t full\nof utter shite these days, the rare moments of brilliance it does have are\nusually on at times when I\u2019m busy doing other things \u2013 reading papers, spiking the sushi in the JCR, writing Angry\nGeek/Felix Hangman fanfiction \u2013 and\nso I\u2019m forced to watch it online later.\nWhy would that be a surprise these days\nanyway, given that I\u2019m connected to the\nInternet? There are animated gifs of cats\nsitting on robotic hoovers that are worth\nmore than ITV\u2019s entire seasonal output.\nAnyway, I\u2019ve calmed down since\ndiscovering that people far crazier than\nI have been posting about John Hales\nfor over four years on internet message\nboards, with the most sane posts being\nentire drafts of legal writs filed against\nhim for defamation of character, and\nthe least sane debating whether or not\nhe really exists at all (complete with\nsignature comparisons for post\u2013 and\npre\u20132008, like a low-grade CSI set on\nthe District Line). The moment where\na man looks at these websites and wonders if they might have a point, as I did\nonly yesterday evening, is the moment\nhe takes a long hard look at himself\nand realises this madness has gone far\nenough. Look at it from John\u2019s perspec-tive. All day he\u2019s signing these fricking\nletters. He probably doesn\u2019t even care.\nAnd there are people out there debating\nwhether or not he even exists. That\u2019s got\nto get to you.\nSo I\u2019ve torn up my hastily drafted\nresponse along with the illustrative\nten\u2013step guide to the rather obscene processes the letter laid out in words, and\ninstead I\u2019m going to write back to him\nwith a factbook of my own. I was thinking maybe a walkthrough to Pokemon\nGold and Silver, or a recipe for some\nkickass Rocky Road I had made for me\nat the weekend.\nI\u2019ll let you know how he replies. If\nyou\u2019re reading this John, no hard feel-ings. Here\u2019s to next month\u2019s thinly\nveiled threat.\nDo you definitely not want to not\nnot go to non-court? Don\u2019t write in\nimmediately to...\nanangrygeek@googlemail.com\nTV license to kill your patience\n\u201cThe letter is full of\nthe most exquisite\nwording, with all\nthe subtlety of an\nelephant\u2013based strip\nparlour\u201d\n\u201cIt is easy to forget\nthat you have the\noption to just\u2026 stop\u201d\nBattersea is full of\nchavs... and Imperial\nCollege students\nThe importance of being idle\nHas this College gone mad?\nA block of PhD student flats\ncalled Griffon Studios is being\nbuilt in the dodgy part of Battersea \u2013 an area saturated with\nchavs. And apparently the landlord has the nerve to charge\n\u00a3235/week for a room no bigger than a shipping container!\nImperial obviously doesn\u2019t\nhave a clue. Griffon Studios is\na typical example of ineffective\ndecision making by the management of our university who\njust don\u2019t give understand that\nstudents aren\u2019t made of mon-ey. The average PhD student\nwill earn \u00a315,300/annum, so\nat \u00a3235/week on rent they\nare left with \u00a33080 spending\nmoney. No amount of waffle\ncan hide that plain fact.\nStudents find themselves in\na lot of financial trouble these\ndays. First, there was that awful\nClegg chap breaking his pledge\non tuition fees. Reminder to\npoliticians, if you hold up a big\nbit of cardboard with a promise\non it, next to your signature on\nit, people will notice when you\ndon\u2019t keep that promise. Then\nthere was that dreadful creep\nOsborne\u2019s VAT rise. By the way,\ndid you know that sanitary towels are subject to VAT? As if\nsanitary towels aren\u2019t a freaking necessity!!!\nSo that\u2019s the ridiculous world\nthat we live in. You would think\nthat we could escape such\nmadness within the confines of\nour university, but sadly not. Instead of helping postgraduates\nfind affordable accommoda-tion, we have Griffon Studios.\nWhy haven\u2019t they created a\nflat-sharing scheme instead?\nOr built halls further outside\ncentral London? Ah well, it is a\ndamned \u2018business opportunity\u2019\nafter all. I would urge you all to\nnot buy into it \u2013 even if you can\nmiraculously afford it \u2013 you will\nbe paying too much for the risk\nof being stabbed nightly.\nThe College has guaranteed\nthat 97% of the rooms will be\noccupied. Well, let them sell\nthe rooms to other universities\nwhen they inevitably don\u2019t meet\nthis guarantee with Imperial\nstudents.

    "content": "FELIX 5\nNEWS\nalready push Imperial students \u201cto live\nmuch closer to our campus than most\nother London universities\u201d, with the associated higher costs. He went on to say\nthat the longer hours would disadvantage poorer students by making it more\ndifficult to keep part-time jobs.\nOpinions about the change in the\nlunch period were mixed. Dr Leroy\nGardner, Director of Undergraduate\nStudies for Civil Engineering, confirmed that 1-hour of lunch was already\nthe norm for Civil Engineering stu-dents. However, the proposed change\nin the lunch hour has caused particular\nconcern in the humanities department.\nMany students, including those on Year\nin Europe and Language for Science de-grees, already continue their language\nstudies into lunchtime and would have\nno lunch break at all if the change was\nimplemented.\nThe reduced lunch hour would also\nhave a negative impact on participation in activities at ETHOS, some have\nargued. Daniel Taffard, the Fitness\nManager at ETHOS, said that popular\nlunchtime classes would be hit if lunch\nwas shortened to one hour: \u201cLunchtime\nclasses are usually one of most productive times in terms of usage so from a\nservice and monetary point of view it\nis important to have these classes running.\u201d He further explained: \u201cThe fact\nthat the students have more than one\nhour is VERY important. The class is\nusually of one hour duration so having\nthe time either side to shower, change,\neat etc. would be important to a student.\u201d\nHeather Jones, Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies), has also argued\nthat the changes would have a negative\nimpact on participation in sports and\nother clubs and societies. Neil Mosley,\nthe Head of Sport Imperial, told Felix\nthat he had written to Professor Dorothy\nGriffiths, who is chairing the committee\ninvestigating the changes, to express his\nviews and that they were \u201csupportive of\nthose of [Imperial College Union].\u201d\nJones expressed concern about Clubs\n& Societies\u2019 access to rooms in College.\n\u201cEither Departmental Administrators\nwill have their workload increased sig-nificantly; they will have to check each\nroom booking for clashes with classes,\nwhich they currently do not have to do.\nOr, they will simply not allow any room\nbookings between 6pm-8pm on the affected days.\u201d Colin Kerr, Departmental\nAdministrator for Civil Engineering, assures societies that although \u201cwe might\nnot be able to make the big lecture\ntheatres available to clubs and societies within those hours, on occasion, we\nshould be able to [continue to] provide\nfor clubs and societies.\u201d Mr Kerr said\nthat he felt that the impact would be\n\u201cmanageable\u201d.\nThere is significant concern amongst\nsports teams. Bernice Cutler, Netball\nTeam Captain, said that late lectures\nwould particularly affect matches between universities. \u201cThe changes will\nbe workable for home matches [...] but\nwe\u2019re going to face problems [with\naway games].\u201d\nFriday 21 january 2011\nFears for\nHumanities\nF\nor many students, the option\nto balance their science degrees with humanities subjects is fantastic opportunity\noffered to ensure they acquire\nthe widest range of skills during their\ntime here. However, some of the proposed timetable changes could increase\nthe pressure on humanities students. It\nis critical that the panel overseeing the\nproposed timetabling changes recognise\nthe importance of humanities to students,\nboth in terms of enjoyment as well as the\ndevelopment of skills and improved em-ployability that comes with the classes.\nThe proposal to have teaching during\nthe lunch hours could mean that those\nundertaking language courses as part of\nYear in Europe or Language for Science\ndegrees, have no lunch break at all. Benjamin Chadwick, a first year Mathematician andYear in Europe student remarked\nthat continuing his French classes into the\nsingle lunch hour \u201cwould be a nightmare\non a busy day, [I need] a break from lectures in which I can relax\u201d.\nThe Languages coordinator, Charmian Brinson, highlighted how the change\nwould cut back the Humanities lunchtime\nprogramme. \u201cReducing the lunchtime\nfrom two hours to one would effectively\nshrink our timetable and the availability\nof places on our courses by half\u201d.\nAnother proposal is to move the Humanities and Language classes of the\nYear in Europe and Language for Science degrees to the evening, from 6pm\nto 8pm, a change welcomed by neither\nstaff nor students. \u201cIt would be very\ndisadvantageous for any student taking\na Languages or Humanities option for\ncredit to be obliged to take this part of\ntheir course in the evenings after a full\nday of lectures and labs,\u201d commented\nCharmian Brinson.\nMiriam Kennedy, a Mechanical Engineering and French student, remarked\nthat Humanities seemed \u201ccompletely under-appreciated\u201d. He added: \u201cIf they are\nan accredited part of their degree, they\nshould be held during college hours and\nvalued as much as any other module.\u201d\nHowever, the value that Imperial\nplaces in Humanities shoudn\u2019t be under-estimated. There is already a very large\nevening class programme of Languages\nand Humanities options from 6pm to\n8pm that are open to everyone including\nstaff, students and members of the pub-lic. They have now also proposed offering new Humanities and business classes\nat these times, on a voluntary basis.\nWith the Humanities department having no representation on the panel, it is\nhoped that the views of both staff and\nstudents will be taken into account in\nany decisions made about the depart-ment. Students are lucky to have such\na flourishing Humanities department\nat a science institution and to be able\nto study such a wide array of subjects.\nHopefully, this will not change.\nSophia David argues\nthat Humanities could be\nnegatively affected by the\nproposed changes\nSports training\ncould be hit\nThe College\u2019s proposals to extend the\nworking day would have several implications in terms of the available time for\nextra-curricular sporting activity.\nAlthough some might find Imperial\u2019s\nlocation within London an advantage,\nfor the sports teams the significant distance to the grounds and the added costs\nof transport has meant that certain teams\nhave the highest budgets and travel expenses of the clubs and societies at Imperial. The latest movements towards\nthe extension of the day has angered\nsome involved in sport, with Netball\nClub Captain Bernice Cutler explaining how training at White City presents\nsome problems in the face of an extended day: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite difficult\nto get students there and back at a reasonable time if people are going to have\nlectures until 7pm.\u201d\nImperial College Union have provided a response to the proposals, with the\nview that an impact on sports training\nwould reduce Imperial\u2019s sporting performance as a university. Neil Mosley,\nHead of Sports Imperial, has said that he\nis \u201csupportive\u201d of the Union\u2019s views.\nIn terms of rescheduling training to\ndifferent days, some clubs are evidently\nwary. Hockey Club Captain Ed Lacey,\nwhose club trains on a Monday at Harlington (near Heathrow) explains that,\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to train on Tuesdays\nbecause we have matches the next day\non Wednesday. Similarly for Thursday,\nwe\u2019ve had a match the day before and\ntrying to get people to train on Friday\nnight would be difficult to say the least.\u201d\nMost, if not all, sports teams also play\nweekend matches.\nHeather Jones warned that \u201c[students]\nwill face a decision between their club\ncommitments and their degree. Some\nwill be discouraged from participating\nin clubs because they won\u2019t be able to\nfit it around their lectures whereas others will choose their club over certain\nlectures and will see their education suffer.\u201d\nStudents protesting cuts to the Humanities Department in 2009\nImperial College London\nJovan Nedic\nDavid Murray\nImperial train with the England team at Harlington in 2008\n\n"

The Atrix\ntakes this to the next level with its laptop dock\naccessory, potentially making it our primary\ncomputer on top of everything else.\nThis contrasts to the way that the majority of\nthe technology industry seems to be heading.\nWith Internet speeds and accessibility improving at such a fast rate this past decade, the concept of \u201cthe cloud\u201d has been on everybody\u2019s\nlips. Services like Dropbox and Apple\u2019s iDisk,\nas well as the idea of home servers, have made\nit possible to have several devices all linked\nup to one source of data. We see this at Imperial every day. Wherever I am, on whatever\ncampus, I know I can log in to any computer\nand see the same desktop screen I always see.\nMoreover, I can VPN in from home and have\naccess to any file I have stored on their system.\nGoogle are currently the ones spearheading\nthe cloud concept. With services like Google\nDocs and Google Calendar, should anyone\ndecide to steal all my gadgets, I know that all\nthat work and all those appointments are safely\nstored on our future overlord\u2019s servers. Soon,\nwe will see this taken to the extreme with\nChrome OS. The principle behind this new\nbrowser-based operating system is that anyone can log into any machine with an Internet\nconnection and be taken to their own account.\nAll of their applications, Internet history, book-marks, themes, documents, etc, are presented\nto them in the same way as their home comput-er.

In the days of the mainframe system, thin clients would connect to a\ncentral computer system for everything, acting\nas a simple terminal. Of course this now outdated technology relied on wired connections,\nbut with technologies like 3G making the internet far more accessible everywhere you go, it\u2019s\na concept that is getting increasingly feasible\non the move. Therefore, the idea of a thin client connecting to, and pulling all information\nfrom, a server has morphed into what we see in\ncloud computing today.\nThe other approach is lot less of a stretch of\nthe imagination, at the moment. The technology we see every day involves: 32GB of storage\non components the size of a thumbnail, laptops\nthat are more powerful than 1980s supercom-puters, and other laptops that are lighter than\nthe majority of textbooks available at the Central Library.

One that involves multi-core proces-sors, super-fast WiFi and 4G Internet connec-tivity, plus phenomenal graphics performance,\nall housed in a pocketable device, which we can\ntake with us everywhere. The big question is: at\nwhat point does this one small device meet the\nuniversal functional needs of the majority.\nThese two very different approaches to\nhow we use computers both come with draw-backs, but as with all other fields of technol-ogy, there\u2019s no telling how magical they could\nbecome in the near future. What I really like\nabout this outlook is the fact that it is us that ultimately benefits, regardless of which method\ndominates. Whether it\u2019s in your pocket or in the\ncloud, all your data will soon be wherever you\nwant it to be.\nits problems by simply refusing to acknowledge that they exist, the quick reaction and\nretraction mark a paradigm shift towards PR\nfriendly policy.\nIn Facebook\u2019s vision of this mobile-friendly\nfuture, users could use their mobiles to access\nup-to-the-minute deals while shopping or eating out, while shops could benefit from having\ndirect contact with customers who shop regularly at their stores, instead of having to route\ntheir ads through Facebook.\nWhile an advertiser\u2019s dream tool, such\nopen access poses a huge number of privacy\nconcerns. Facebook already suffers from a\nsizeable data mining problem as profiteering devlopers attempt to gain access to user\ndata under the guise of providing some other\nservice, and it\u2019s not a stretch to imagine the\ntrouble this would cause if they were allowed\nto reach you at home or at work.\nThe problem with the Facebook development system is the ease by which a developer\ncan start distributing an application. Facebook only requires developers confirm their\nphone numbers or their credit card details,\nafter which they can publish any number of\napplications. This is different to the system at\nApple, for example, where developers have\ntheir code vetted before it enters the market.\nFacebook\u2019s reversal suggests that if they do\nlaunch a revised version, users might be in\nmuch more control of when and where they\nmay be contacted by developers. Yet it again\nbrings up the question of whether users understand what they sign up for on the Internet, and\nif they do, whether they really care.\nFELIX\n12 Friday 21 JANUARY 2011\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nHitchcock Ballet\nClassic Cinema\nBreakfast at Tiffanys\u2019\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of one of legendary actress Audrey Hepburn\u2019s most celebrated\nworks: Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s \u2013 a film which saw Hepburn\u2019s return to the screen, having just had her first\nchild. Directing was the renowned Blake Edwards,\nwho passed away last month.\nBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s revolves around Holly Golightly, a scatty yet irresistibly charming young woman.\nHer life in New York, a whirlwind of fine dining and\nhedonistic parties, is financed by her numerous attentive and devoted \u2018gentlemen admirers\u2019. When a\nstruggling writer moves into Holly\u2019s building, the two\nstrike up a friendship and, as he is pulled deeper\nand deeper into Holly\u2019s world, he begins to explore\nher murky past and the secret longings she has kept\nhidden.\nHepburn\u2019s career-defining portrayal of Holly absolutely steals the show. She creates a character of\nsuch otherworldly elegance, such refined femininity,\nthat the audience is captivated by her every move.\nAt the same time the girl\u2019s dark side bubbles quietly\nat the surface, a gentle but significant provider of\ndepth, that goes a long way.\nSeen today, the film certainly shows its age; a benefit in some ways, but a drawback in others. Segments of dialogue often verge on the unbearably sen-timental; the plot is quite predictable, and as a result\na little unsatisfying.\nBut Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s is a \u2018pleasant\u2019 film, in a\nway that films today cannot be. From the very opening scene, with its measured pacing and gorgeous\ncamerawork, the film is, above all, nice to look at.\nWatching it is like watching Miss Golightly herself:\nrefined, glamorous; exuding a positive air of good\nhealth.\nNavid Nabijou\nJapanese Schoolgirls will never be able to\nreach this level of adorableness\nFilm Editors: Jade Hoffman\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDirector Darren Aronofsky provides a masterful account of the human psyche\u2019s masochistic\ntendencies in a tale of the corruption of inno-cence, paranoia, and one hell of a psychotic\nbreakdown. Black Swan is the story of sheltered ballerina Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman),\nwho has recently been handed the much-cov-eted lead role in Swan Lake. Quiet, innocent\nand dedicated; Sayers has the perfect qualities\nto represent the purity and grace of the White\nSwan, however, it is her portrayal of the erotic\nand passionate abandon of the character\u2019s alter\nego that presents the greatest barrier between\nNina and success. It is no mean feat for a virginal teenager, who lives at home, and sleeps in\na room that looks as if it has been decorated by\na team of loved-up Care Bears, with a particularly strong penchant for pink.\nShe attempts this metamorphosis into the\nBlack Swan under the mentorship of the show\u2019s\nartistic director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), who uses seduction and bullying in equal\nmeasures to draw Nina out of her shell. Throw\na smothering, bitter mother (Barbara Hershey)\nand a sly seductress (Mila Kunis) intent on\nstealing her part into the mix, and all the ingredients are there for a monumental melt-down.\nAnd what a melt-down it is. Nina\u2019s loss of grip\non reality is marked by a series of hallucina-tory, increasingly violent episodes that blur the\nboundaries between reality and the imaginary\nmanifestations of Nina\u2019s insecurities. The result is a frenetic, and completely absorbing\nfilm within a film; where the events on and off\nthe stage tragically mirror one another as Nina\nattempts to become the titular Black Swan\nwhilst maintaining her sanity.\nWhilst you can sympathise with Nina, how-ever, and appreciate the caustic environment\nthat she exists in, this film does little to actually make the viewer like the character. She\nis distrustful, paranoid and it is hard to fight\nthe feeling that she somehow has brought all\nthis upon herself. This is my major problem\nwith the film, as I find that narratives of this\ntype work best when the audience feel strongly\none way or the other about the lead character.\nThe power of Aronofsky\u2019s previous films (The\nWrestler, Requiem for a Dream) relies on a real\nemotional connection with the characters; The\nWrestler is mainly such a fantastic film beThe result is a frenetic,\nand completely\nabsorbing film within a\nfilm\n\u201c\nThe resul\nThe resu\nand comp\nand comp\nb bi\nbi\n\u201d\ny\ny\nm within a\nm within a\nDirector Darren Aronofsky\nScreenwriter Mark Heyman, Andres\nHeinz, John McLaughlin\nCast Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel,\nMila Kunis\nBlack Swan\nJan Piotrowski\ncause you geuinely care about Rorke\u2019s persona.\nWhilst Sayers\u2019 spiralling descent into psychosis is undoubtedly tragic and gripping, the lack\nof connection with the character creates more\nof an adrenaline-packed experience rather than\nan emotionally harrowing one. This is by no\nmeans a poor reflection of Portman\u2019s acting\nability, who delivers a fantastic performance\nthat marks a departure from her usual roles as\nquirky, yet generally harmless heroines. Neither is this necessarily a wholly negative point\nas the film still works tremendously well \u2013 it is\njust a matter of personal preference.\nOne thing that must be said is that the film\nlooks fantastic. Cinematographer, Matthew\nLibatique, creates an atmosphere that fits perfectly with the duality of the plot by switching\nbetween slow and graceful scenes, and scenes\nthat move at nausea-inducing speed. The most\nsurprising revelation was that the film created\na completely unexpected appreciation of the\nballet itself. A combination of the fluid camera work, and Portman\u2019s discipline (she spent\n6 months in gruelling training for the role) results in scenes that are quite simply beautiful\nto watch. Despite all the pirouettes and demipli\u00e9s, however, Black Swan is, above all, a psychological thriller bordering on horror. While\nit may be accused of pushing the melodrama\nto the limit, it is definitely a couple of hours\nof fantastic (if a little stressful) entertainment\nthat goes beyond anything that you would expect from a film based around ballet. It is dark,\nmoody cinema at its best, and will keep you on\nthe edge of your seat better than any slasher or\ngruesome horror flick could hope to achieve.\nWhen I see this in the mirror, I\u2019m usually trippin\u2019 balls\nFELIX\n28 Friday 21 January 2011\n\n"

Isn\u2019t that where all the sluts live?\u201d\nDodgeball: Wolverines\nedge up league table\nBrilliant.\nAfter catching the train, haggling with\nsome very desperate cab drivers, and\nwaiting around for a while because of\ndelays, we finally got underway at 1pm.\nIC Wolverines were placed in a tough\ngroup with Bedford Bulls A, the eventual winners, and a team we had crossed\nswords with in Southampton earlier in\nthe season, Minotaur Dodgeball.\nThe way tournament matches work\nis that you have five two-minute games\nand the team to have won the most out\nof those five, wins the match.\nThe first match of the day was against\nthe Minotaurs and it proved a feisty af-fair! Their captain, \u2018Moore\u2019, is well\nknown for being a bit of a complainer,\nbut on Sunday he took \u201cthrowing one\u2019s\ntoy out of one\u2019s pram\u201d to another level,\nturning the entire crowd against him.\nThe unfit, untrained and turkey stuffed\nIC girls rocked up to Ethos on Monday\nnight with much foreboding, the unmistakable sense of apprehension and anxiety could only mean one thing. Medics.\nThis year\u2019s match was made even more\npersonal due to Becky\u2019s unfortunate living arrangements with the medic captain.\nThe team\u2019s strategy was simple, win\nand win well. IC got off to a great start\nover turning the first Medic centre and\nscoring the first two goals. In the mean-time, captain Lucie was eager to sever\nany prior medic relations ensuring the\nopposition captain crumbled to floor in\nher wake. However, from here things\nstarted to go a bit pear shaped and our\nlack of training became evident towards\nthe end of the first quarter with IC narrowly leading 8 \u2013 6 when the whistle\nblew.\nThings picked up in the second quarter\nand there was excellent movement in the\nLucinda Hazell\nNetball\nIC 3rd 32 - 24 Medics 4th\nNetball: IC\nbeat the\nMedics in\nfirst match\nof term\nIC goal third between shooters Angela\nand Heather, however the medics had\nsome good set plays in the centre third\nand IC were unable to extend their lead,\nthe score at the end of the first half was\n15 \u2013 13.\nAfter a rousing team talk at half time\nthe IC girls returned to the court feeling\nrevitalised, it was a fantastic quarter and\nthere was brilliant defensive play from\nFern and Nakai, intercepting many balls\nin the medic\u2019s goal third. The IC girls\nfinally looked like they were on form,\nthere were some exceptional shots from\ngoal shooter Lucinda and great passing\naround the goal third by centre Sarah\nand wing attack Lucie. IC were able to\nscore twice as many goals as the medics,\nincreasing the lead at the end of the third\nquarter to 25 \u2013 18.\nIn the last quarter the medics rallied\ntogether for a final attack but it wasn\u2019t\nenough to worry the IC girls and the final score was 32 \u2013 24.\nDespite some untidy play it was a\ngood first game back for the third team\nand a promising start to the term.\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nBased on the book Between a Rock\nand a Hard Place, 127 Hours is the true\nstory of Aron Ralston, an outdoors-man in his late 20s with a passion for\nmountaineering. While canyoning one\nsunny afternoon in Utah, he misjudged\na boulder and took a fall. This would not\nhave been so bad \u2013 he is an experienced\nclimber after all \u2013 except that his right\narm is pinned under the boulder and he\nis trapped 100ft inside a canyon in the\nmiddle of the great wilderness. The film\ncharts the tale of Aron Ralston\u2019s struggle\nto stay alive and is is certainly not for\nthe faint-hearted.\nThere are many sound reasons to go\nand see 127 Hours, not least because it\nis Danny Boyle\u2019s latest film. The British\ndirector whose debut with Trainspotting\ngained him a cult following, and recent\nOscar-winning hit Slumdog Millionaire,\nhas thankfully not lost his unique style\nin going international. 127 Hours is a\npure brew of Boyle\u2019s essence and it exudes a very indie feel for a mainstream\nfilm. Boyle is not afraid to experiment\nwith the unconventional and the brilliant\ncinematography is one of many things\nthat make this movie so worth watching.\nBoyle combines dreamy surrealism with\na hardy \u201cMan vs. The Wild\u201d film: an\nunusual, heady concoction that is fresh\nand invigorating.\nIn a role that earned him a well-deserved Golden Globe nomination,\nJames Franco pulls off a wide-ranging\nportrayal of mountaineer Aron Ralston.\nAron Ralston was an avid cameraman\nand documented his adventures exten-sively. Staying true to this, Boyle uses\nRalston\u2019s self-documented videos as an\nintegral part in exploring his character\ntransformation, propelling the plot forward (it\u2019s like what James Cameron did\nin Avatar, only better). From the carefree adventurer we were introduced to at\nthe start of the movie, Franco\u2019s Ralston\ntransforms into the solemn man facing\nhis impending death as things gets desperate under the boulder. It is a performance that shines through to the heart of\nthe audience.\nFranco\u2019s performance, however, is\nnot enough to carry the film and it is a\nsurprising stumbling block for Boyle,\nwho has created some excellent character driven dramas (Slumdog Millionaire\nand Sunshine), that 127 Hours\u2019 main\nweakness is its lack of story. It feels very\nmuch like one of those indie films that\nhave so much style but lack plot content.\nAfter the first 15 minutes or so, Aron\ngets trapped under the boulder and, for\nthe remainder of the movie, his struggle to free himself to no avail is an onslaught of sentimentalism with death at\nDirector Danny Boyle\nScreenwriter Simon Beaufoy,\nDanny Boyle\nCast James Franco, Kate Mara,\nAmber Tamblyn, Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy\n127 Hours\nGuo Heng Chin\nDirector Profile: Danny Boyle\nEd Knock\nThe creative void of the \u201880s in cinema\ndid not leave British cinema unaffected.\nThe \u2018Carry on\u2026\u2019 films and Hammer\nHorror series had fizzled out aons ago\nand the legacy of Ken Loach and Lindsay Anderson\u2019s Kitchen Sink dramas\nstill left a stale aftertaste of gritty misery on British filmmaking. However as\nshoulder pads and big hair were quickly\ndiscarded in favour of baggy t-shirts\nand high waisted jeans and electro and\ndisco mutated into the craziness of rave\nmusic; a special talent emerged to help\nre-energize the wayward film scene and\npull it out of the doldrums. That talent\nwas Danny Boyle and now a household\nname, his distinctive style and ability to\ntranscend genres hadn\u2019t been seen since\nthe golden days of Stanley Kubrick.\nIt was obvious from the opening of\nBoyle\u2019s debut film Shallow Grave that\nthis director was special, a furious and\ndizzying display of the streets of Glasgow\naccompanied by a blistering acid techno\ntrack composed by a then unknown LeftJames Franco gives his right arm to 127 Hours\nhis elbow that all gets rather repetitive.\nThe book upon which this movie\nis based featured extensive flashback\nscenes. This is something that Boyle\ncould have used more extensively to\ndevelop the character of Aron Ralston\nwith more depth and empathy. Whilst\nBoyle does capture the tale of a young\nman\u2019s struggle for life and the introspective transformation that follows, the film\ndoes, unfortunately, become tedious at\ntimes with its monotonous setting only\noccasionally punctuated by sentimentalism and shock.\n127 Hours is a noteworthy cinematic\nachievement but I doubt it can compete\nwith the highly intelligent The Social\nNetwork and the heartfelt King\u2019s Speech\nin the Academy Awards around the cor-ner, mostly due to its lack of solid plot.\nAt only 93 minutes, however, its imaginative and harrowing build-up to the\nfinale is masterfully executed, and will\nstill keep you glued to your seat.\nfield. Boyle would persue his affinity for\ndance music in later films, helping launch\nthe careers of Underworld by featuring\ntheir famous Born Slippy track in the\niconic ending of Trainspotting.\nDanny Boyle was born to an Irish\nfamily in Lancashire in 1956. His strict\nCatholic upbringing was a direct influence on the morality of characters in\nmany of his films and was directly addressed in brilliant but underappreciated\nMillions. Dissuaded from joining a seminary by a priest, Boyle eventually cut\nhis teeth directing plays in London and\nproducing programmes for the BBC instead of learning his craft at film school.\nTo say that Shallow Grave was a\nbreath of fresh air is an understatement;\nit launched the careers of Christopher\nEcclestone and Ewan McGregor and\nbecame the most successful British film\nof 1994. The unnerving atmosphere of\nthe black comedy was achieved with\nminimal dialogue, disjointed editing and\nunusual camera shots maximising the\nimpact of shadows. Boyle casted Ewan\nMcGregor again in the adaptation of Irving Welsh\u2019s Trainspotting, the film that\ncame to symbolise Tony Blair\u2019s \u2018Cool\nBritania\u2019. The combination of snappy\nediting, surreal montages, fast camera\nwork and an excellent soundtrack twisted audiences into enjoying what was essentially a horrendous tale of how hard\ndrugs ruin lives.\nWith the reputation of being the hottest\ndirector in England, it was inevitable that\nBoyle would be snared by Hollywood\nand reunited with his regular screenwriter John Hodge he headed to Thailand\nto film The Beach. It was his first flop,\nuniversally panned by critics. The Beach\nsuffered from studio interference and a\nmiscast Leonardo di Caprio, who was\nflown in to replace Ewan McGregor who\nhad fallen out with the director.\nIt took only two years for Danny Boyle\nto bounce back and single handedly reinvent the forgotten zombie-apocalypse\ndrama with 28 Days Later. Shooting\nmany sections on digital and starring\nnewcomers Cillian Murphy and Naomie\nHarris alongside Christopher Ecclestone,\n28 Days Later was soon declared a horror classic. The mesmerisings scenes of\na hospital robe-attired Cillian Murphy\nwandering hopeless amongst a desolate\ncentral London ravaged by rage-inflicted\nzombies is timeless. Buoyed by the success of 28 Days Later, Boyle made his\nmost personal film, Millions. It dealt with\nthe moral dilemma of finding a large\namount of money and the innocence of\nchildren and was a critical triumph.\nSunshine reunited Boyle and Cillian\nMurphy for second time. Murphy, having been elevated to star status with\nroles in Batman Begins and The Wind\nThat Shakes the Barley, could not rescue\nthe film from being a commercial flop.\nHowever Danny Boyle eventually joined\nthe ranks of superstar directors when\nSlumdog Millionaire took eight Oscars\nin 2009 including best film and director.\n127 Hours, reviewed below, is the second outing of Boyle\u2019s with writer Simon\nBeaufoy and looks to be his most successful film yet after winning a slew of\naccolades from the critics. Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s crown of being the greatest British\ndirector of all time looks ever more precarious with each film of Danny Boyle\u2019s.\nI hate it when it slowly dawns on you that you\u2019\nre going to have to chop your own arm off with a penknife\nFELIX 29\nFriday 21 January 2011\n\n"

If the picture is really as grim as she painted it to\nbe, expect plenty of hand wringing for\ninvestors and governments alike in the\ncoming weeks and months.\nMunicipal bonds are a type of debt\nsecurity issued by states or counties,\nwhich are used to finance expenditures such as the construction of roads\nor schools. Traditionally, they are considered low risk investments that offer\nsteady, tax-exempted earnings. Many of\nthem are bought by individuals from the\nhigh income tax groups for their favourable tax implications.\nOnce considered \u201crisk free\u201d investments because of trust and implicit guarantees that the governments\u2019 backing\nprovides, municipal bonds have been\nfacing substantial outflows of capital\nsince last November. Individual investors have already withdrawn US $3.1\nbn from funds specialising in municipal\nbonds.\nYields for bonds issued by local governments and similar entities have shot\nup, reflecting an increase in perceived\nrisk for such bonds and the borrowing\ncosts for the issuers. Some even argued\nthat states like California are already in\ndefault due to their poor financial health,\nwhich makes it almost impossible for\nthem to honour their debts.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative\neasing is responsible for this sudden\nchange in investors\u2019 attitudes. Fearing\nthat the Fed\u2019s QE2 program could lead\nto higher inflation and depress the value\nof the dollar, investors began selling\ngovernment bonds. This in turn led to a\nsharp rise in bond yields in the market\nthat then affected the municipal bonds.\nIn addition, there has also been a deluge\nof new issuance that flooded the municipal bond market, as cash-strapped states\nturn to issuing new debt to raise more\nfunds.\nThe brewing problems in municipal\nbonds have wider implications than financial hardship for American states\nand their residents. It calls into question\nwhether any states or nations are truly\nsafe from a Greek style crisis. When\ndiscussing the current Eurozone crisis,\nanalysts seem to have drawn a clear distinction between the struggling \u201cperipheral\u201d economies and more robust ones.\nHowever, no one can say for sure where\nthe line is drawn for the rest, and when\ncrossing the line will trigger another crisis in government debt.\nMunicipal bonds:\nThe latest bubble?\nLingxi Huang considers the credibility of the latest\nconcerns being raised about municipal bonds in the US\nRead this article\nonline at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nSnippets\nBoE monetary policy criticised\nThis week several MPs have been adding their voices to the economists who have been warning of uncontrollable inflation for some time now. The Bank\nof England (BoE) has been failing in its mandate\nof holding inflation rates below 2% for over a year,\nas a result of record low interest rates. December\nsaw especially high price rises, and new figures will\nbe published in February. After that, BoE governor\nMervyn King will face the British Parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee to justify his policies.\nJohn Thurso, a Liberal Democrat member of the\ncommittee has warned that he is \u201clooking for reassurance that we\u2019re not just quietly abandoning the\ninflation target.\u201d A Conservative fellow committee\nmember, Mark Garnier (not of laboritore fame) added that fuel price inflation in particular is \u201cespecially\na problem outside London where people rely on\ntheir cars to move around.\u201d\nHowever, the Government is relying on the current\nweakness of Sterling to lower the rate of increase\nin the national debt. The fear is that tightening monetary policy may endanger this.\nThe opposition Labour party has been taking this\nposition, with one of their Treasury Committee members arguing, \u201cthe recovery has enough problems\nwith the spending cuts and growing unemployment.\nIf the MPC lost its nerve at this moment, I really\nthink that would be the final straw. We would be in\ndanger of going back into recession.\u201d\nGoldman profits fall, bonuses cut\nGoldman Sachs announced this week that its fourth\nquarter profits for last year were \u00a31.5 bn, less than\nhalf of the figure for 2009. The poor showing had\nbeen anticipated by the market, resulting in a drop\nof only 2.7 per cent in Goldman\u2019s share price on release of the figures.\nThe combined profit from all four quarters of 2010\nwas reported as \u00a35.3 bn, almost 40 per cent lower\nthan one year ago. Goldman has blamed low client\nactivity in the fixed income, currencies and commodities group for the weak performance.\nThis is confirmed by the fact that the bank made\nmost of its profits from proprietary trading. This is\nwhere banks use their own money, rather than client money, to trade for their own account. The practice has been made somewhat more difficult as a\nresult of the major financial regulation Bill that the\nUS passed last year.\nBut the bank has still been able to set aside \u00a39.6\nbn for its end of year bonus pool, down only 5 per\ncent on last year. This represents almost 40 per cent\nof its net revenue for 2010, double the amount set\naside for share holder dividends.\nThe Bank\u2019s Executive Chairman Lloyd Blankfein remained optimistic, seeing, \u201csigns of growth and\nmore economic activity\u201d in the near future.\nCalifornia was the first US state to look insolvent after 2008, largely because of don\u2019t-tax-but-spend-anyway ballot initiatives\n\u201c[The United States\nis] facing sizable\ndefaults of municipal\ndebt on a nationwide\nscale\u201d\n\n"

This has also opened the way\nfor 3D graphics directly in the browser without\nthe need for any third-party plugins like Flash\nthrough a yet-to-be-standardised technology\ncalled WebGL. Couple this with the myriad of\nimprovements in JavaScript, the programming\nlanguage that makes the web interactive, and\nsuddenly game developers have a new, usable\nplatform for making online games.\nBut HTML5 is entering an already saturated\nplaying field. With Adobe\u2019s Shockwave Flash\nby far the most popular platform, and Microsoft\u2019s Silverlight and Java being less widely\nused alternatives, it might be hard to see what\nroom there is for another way of creating and\ndeploying online games. HTML5, however,\nhas some significant advantages over the\ncompetition. Because HTML is the part of the\nGaming is no longer all about consoles. Web\ngames have gone from being the domain of bespectacled nerds to the salvation of the chronically bored masses. As game authors set the bar\nincreasingly higher and tax our browsers to the\nlimit, a new contender enters the eternal web\nformat wars. To make a difference, it\u2019s going to\nhave to be fast, good-looking and feature-rich.\nEvery webpage you have ever visited was written in a special computer language called HTML,\nor \u2018HyperText Markup Language\u2019, which tells\nyour browser what to display, where to display\nit and how it should look. As it\u2019s the language\nthe runs the entire Internet it\u2019s pretty important\nthat everyone is speaking it in the same way, and\nfor this reason HTML is a standardised language\nwith a static set of features. The last update to the\nstandard was in 1997 with HTML 4.0, and back\nthen the web was a much simpler beast. No-one\nwatched videos on YouTube and no-one chatted\non Facebook, and it was impossible to see how\nthe web would evolve and to design HTML with\nthis in mind. Almost fifteen years of progress later and HTML 4.0 just doesn\u2019t cut it for building\nweb sites to the standard we\u2019ve come to expect.\nHTML5 is the name given to a collection of\nnew technologies, championed and standardised\nby web watchdog the World Wide Web Consortium, that updates the core technology that lies\nat the very heart of the web. Offline storage,\nrich browser-site communication and all-new\ngraphical effects are among the features that will\nbe landing in browsers soon, if not already: up-to-date users of Firefox, Chrome and Opera can\nstart using HTML5-enabled sites immediately.\nIt hasn\u2019t been around for long and not every\nweb browser supports it, but HTML5 has already\nbegun making ripples in online game develop-ment. HTML5 effectively adds a \u2018canvas\u2019 to the\nweb, allowing game developers to \u2018draw\u2019 shapes\nand sprites to the screen just like in conventional\nvery fabric of the web the content is rendered\nright in the browser without the need for any\nthird-party plugins or extensions. This is of\nparticular advantage to phone users: HTML5\nis already supported on the iPhone and iPad\n(where Flash isn\u2019t allowed to tread) and on\nAndroid phones, and games built using it can\nbe played on all three without modification.\nHTML5\u2019s strength is also unfortunately it\u2019s\ndownfall. When it comes to displaying the\ngraphics and running the game the browser\nis strictly in charge, but this also means that\nthe browser sets the limit of what\u2019s possible.\nFlash outperforms HTML5 in a number of key\nperformance areas because it can be given access to a computer\u2019s graphics card via \u2018hardware acceleration\u2019, and because Flash runs the\ngame and moves the screen around simultaneously where HTML5 and JavaScript do them\none after the other it can handle more taxing\ngraphical effects and physics. Browsers get\nbetter every day, but developers still have to\nwork hard to match the performance of Flash\nwhilst still having visuals that look as sweet.\nBut there is some good news for develop-ers. To write a game for Flash or iPhone needs\nspecialist software which, naturally, Adobe\nand Apple charge large sums for. HTML5,\nhowever, is a free and open standard, meaning\nthat anyone can start using it without having to\nbuy licenses or programs. This is great for the\nhome developer and opens up the world of online games to anyone and everyone who wants\nto have a go at making their own. Plus, there\nare already scores of specially-built libraries\nthat can make writing a game significantly\neasier and quicker than starting from scratch.\nThe community at Internet news site reddit.\ncom have compiled (redd.it/f094j) a large list\nof available libraries that solve problems in\nkey areas like game physics, graphics, animation and sound, so there\u2019s no excuse for the\nbudding developer not to give HTML5 a go.\nSimon Worthington\nWossy reveals Nintendo 3DS details\nFive HTML5 games to try!\n\u2022 Pirates Love Daisies pirateslovedaisies.com\nThe most impressive title in this list!

The proposals,\nwhich include extending the day to 8am\nuntil 7pm for undergraduates and until\n8pm for postgraduates, on Mondays and\nThursdays, are still under consideration\nbut they have been treated with apprehension by students and members of\nstaff alike, many of whom were not officially informed of the proposals. The\nfirst meeting of the committee on Monday 17th January was cancelled at short\nnotice for unknown reasons.\nImperial College Union has raised\na number of concerns about the widespread effect of the changes including:\nthe possible negative impact on participation in clubs and societies, reduced\nattendance in lectures, the impact on\nparticipation in humanities courses and\nthe negative impact on student welfare.\nPro-Rector for Education, Professor\nJulia Buckingham, said that the proposals would help Imperial \u201cuse [its]\nteaching space most effectively and\nensure that [it could] accommodate the\ngrowing number of Master\u2019s courses\nand extra-curricular programmes the\nCollege offers.\u201d She reassured students\nand staff that the committee was simply\ninvestigating the proposals and that any\nrecommendations that it made would\n\u201cbe given further consideration at both\nthe Strategic Education Committee and\nthe College\u2019s Management Board.\u201d\nProfessor Omar Matar, Director of Undergraduate Studies (DoUG) for Chemical Engineering acknowledged that the\nchanges were being proposed \u201cwith the\nbest of intentions, to create more flexibility in the timetable\u201d. However, he\nquestioned the need for them, saying:\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t asked for an extension to\nthe College day.\u201d He told Felix that he\nwas \u201cconfident that we will not need\nto schedule any undergraduate lectures\nfrom 8am-9am or from 6pm-7pm. However, ProfessorAngus Mackinnon, Director of Undergraduate Studies for Physics,\nsaid that though he was \u201cnot a fan of the\nproposed change\u201d, he would be forced to\nuse it due to the \u201ctimetable congestion in\n[the] Physics [department].\u201d\nColin Kerr, the Departmental Administrator for Civil Engineering, con-curred: \u201cIf we were to extend the day, it\nwould make the job of timetabling classes easier. There would be less clashing\nof modules and it would be possible to\noffer a range of options.\u201d\nProfessor Buckingham said the College is \u201capproaching a limit on the\nteaching space available for all the activities undertaken day to day.\u201d\nProfessor Matar told Felix that neither\nhe nor his colleagues had been consult-ed: \u201cThe proposed changes haven\u2019t been\ndiscussed with me and I have consulted\nwith a number of my colleagues and\nthey haven\u2019t been discussed with them\neither.\u201d The sentiment was shared by\nother members of staff, many of whom\nhad not heard of the proposals.\nA spokesperson for UCL confirmed\nthat lectures there start at 9am, although\n\u201cUndergraduate Computer Sciences\nteaching occasionally starts at 8am\u201d.\nThe last lectures are from 4pm-5pm according to the spokesperson.\nThere has been significant concern\nabout the impact of early morning lectures on the welfare of both students\nand staff. Professor Mackinnon pointed\nout that \u201cthere are bound to be serious\nproblems for staff [\u2026] who have to organise childcare.\u201d He also expressed\nhis sympathy for students and staff who\nmight have a lecture at 8am and also\nat 6pm in the same day: \u201cI\u2019d hate to be\neither a lecturer or a student who found\nhimself with lectures at both 8am and\n6pm.\u201d Charlotte Ivision, Deputy President (Welfare), argued that a longer day\nwould take a \u201cphysical toll on students in\nterms of fatigue and in terms of less flexibility when it comes to managing their\nfree time.\u201d One Director of Undergraduate Studies told Felix privately, \u201cthe general effect would be tiring for students\u201d.\nProfessor Buckingham told Felix that\n\u201cthat any new arrangements must be family friendly\u201d and that staff and students\nwould be expected to work longer hours.\nProfessor Mater argued that it would\nbe difficult for some staff to attend 8am\nlectures: \u201cI know a lecturer who lives\nin Peterborough, another who lives in\nReading. It will be extremely difficult\nfor them to teach lectures at 8am.\u201d\nHe also questioned the likely attendance rate of students saying: \u201cI\u2019m not\nentirely sure what the attendance of students will be like for early or late lec-tures. We know that attendance at 9am\nlectures is less than at other times.\u201d\nPostgraduate students, however, were\ngenerally more receptive to the ideas.\nWhile Ritika Gupta, a masters student\nin biomedical engineering, said that she\nthought that \u201cit\u2019s hard enough to cope\nwith the timetable at the moment\u201d and\nothers said that since they already had to\nstay in college for most of the day they\nwouldn\u2019t mind their lectures being spread\nover a longer period. Charlotte Ivision,\nUnion Deputy President (Welfare), raised\nconcerns about the well-being of students\naffected by the changes. She said there\ncould be problems for \u201cmature students\nwith children and students from certain\nethnic backgrounds who may have home\ncommitments requiring them to be at\nhome in the time currently free\u201d.\nZahra Kadom, a representative of the\nAhulul Bayt Islamic Society, commented that the changes would be problematic in the months of Ramadan, during\nwhich \u201ca lot of people travel to their local mosques to attend services\u201d, usually\nbetween \u201c6-7pm, which would clash\nwith the proposed timetabling.\u201d\nStephen Long, an Ordinary Member\nof the Union Council, raised the issue of\naccommodation arguing that long hours\nThe Social Space in Silwood Park, Imperial\u2019s campus in Ascot, has been undergoing refurbishment\nto provide better recreational conditions. The common room will be transformed to meet the quality standards of other parts of the campus, with\nsignificant heating and lighting upgrades to be\napplied. The estimated completion date is today\n(Friday 21st January).\nPresident of the Silwood Park Student Union, Mark\nRamsden, was informed of the work beginning early\nthis term. Plans will incorporate finishes to the floor\nand walls chosen by students themselves.\nStudents were pleased to hear the plans, with appreciation for the common room\u2019s standards rising\nto better represent the world class research centre.\nVarious divisions of Natural Sciences have a presence on campus, in addition to the NERC (Natural\nEnvironment Research Council) Centre for Population Biology, the International Pesticide Application\nResearch Centre (IPARC) and the Imperial College\nReactor Centre. A science and business park is also\nnearby.\nSilwood Park, sporting a reactor and therefore a\nlicensed nuclear site, is home to one hundred hectares of semi-natural habitats including a lake, three\nstreams, grasslands, woodlands and wetlands. The\ncampus is tailored to postgraduate and PhD students studying Biology, Geophysics, Meteorology\nand is a frequently visited site for Civil Engineers to\nperform surveying.\nMany Silwood Park staff have spent time working\non pest problems overseas, and are highly experienced in the field of Life Sciences.

There was\nnone of the jewel-hued colour blocking\nwe saw over at womenswear, but just\npops of juicy brights: burnt orange, pea\ngreen, mustard or royal blue featuring as\njust one piece in an ensemble, a sweater\nperhaps, or coral red trousers - a favourite at Jil Sander, or maybe an eye-catch-ing overcoat, as seen at Bottega Veneta\nand Burberry - choose from rainbow-hued\npea and trench coats at Burberry (where\nthe drama of the clothes was matched by\nthe faux rain in the finale), or warm wool\nduffels at Bottega Veneta. No pastels in\nsight, and certainly no patterns: simple,\nhigh-impact pieces and astute colour usage is the key here - overkill is not an op-tion. Pick one thing, and stick to that.\nTranslation: take cue from Tomas Meier\nat Bottega Veneta, who combined his elegant monochrome basics with shots of\nrich, bright hues.\nThe 1970s throwback seen on the\nSpring/Summer 2011 womenswear catwalks was always bound to translate into\nmenswear, though with somewhat varying\nsuccess. But let\u2019s put it this way - Saturday Night Fever is definitely upon us, like\nit or not. At Prada, there were V-patterned\nnylon tracksuits, emerald green lurex\nturtlenecks (oh no they didn\u2019t) and pumpkin suede patchwork jackets. A collective\ncurled lip and hiss of disgust from every\nman worth his sartorial salt. But over at\nSalvatore Ferregamo and Roberto Cavalli, the story was a little different, with a\nslightly more subtle, and moreover tasteful approach to the groovy influence.

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nI\nn November last year the latest in\na seemingly never-ending string\nof social networks launched.\n\u2018Path\u2019was hyped as a new way to\nsocialise online and claimed to be\nfounded on scientific principles. Its creators call it \u2018a personal network\u2019 where\nusers can augment existing relationships\ninstead of replacing them. Uniquely, on\nthis social network you are limited to\n50 friends. So what are these scientific\nprinciples, and what questions does this\nnew network raise about our ability to\nmanage our online relationships?\nThe hope is that, since users are restricted to sharing pictures and videos\nwith 50 friends, they will be encouraged to share more personal moments\nwith their nearest and dearest, instead of\nbroadcasting their lives indiscriminately.\nWhy 50? Path\u2019s creators claim to be\ninspired by the anthropologist Professor Robin Dunbar. In 1992, Dunbar\nused data from primates to generate a\nnumber, popularly known as Dunbar\u2019s\nnumber, which predicts the stable social\ngroup size to which humans are cogni-tively limited. This lies between 100 and\n230, but the commonly cited figure is\n150. He extrapolated this number from\ndata showing a strong relationship between the number of primates in a social\ngroup and the volume of a brain area\ncalled the neocortex.\nDunbar found that personal relationships in these groups expanded approximately by a factor of 3. \u201cYour personal\nreal world social network actually consists of a series of circles or layers that\ntypically number 5, 15, 50, 150, 500,\n1500 (with each layer inclusive of the\nones inside it),\u201d Dunbar explains. Path\u2019s\ncreators limit your online friends to 50,\nsaying that these are the people who \u201cwe\nconsider to be the most important and\nvalued people in our lives.\u201d\nSocial groups are traditionally maintained primarily through close physical\ncontact, but online social networks can\nsimulate physical proximity with friends\nall over the world. Does the virtual world\ntherefore function differently to the\nphysical one? Is Dunbar\u2019s number relevant online? Some people believe that\nin the age of extreme social connectivity,\nDunbar\u2019s number is increasingly irrelevant due to the fact that we can maintain some form of relationship with huge\nnumbers of people. In an influential blog\npost, Chris Brogan, businessman and\njournalist, outlines how to \u2018beat\u2019 Dunbar\u2019s number and maintain huge social\nnetworks through extreme organisation.\nHowever, Dunbar argues that, in real-ity, this is not possible. \u201cNetwork size\nin the virtual world seems to mirror\nnetwork size in the real world, both according to our data and that of others.\nFacebook did a complete analysis of\nthe [average] number of friends [people\nhad] in their entire database in February\n2010, and the average was 120-130.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a question as to what limits\nnetwork size in the real world -- time,\nmemory or (emotional) cognition,\u201d\nDunbar explains, \u201cIf it is time or memory (i.e. keeping track of what people\nhave done), then digital media should\nsolve that and allow us to increase network size. There seems to be no evidence that the electronic world actually\ndoes allow us to increase network size,\nsuggesting that the constraint is something to do with the kind of interaction\nor emotional cognition.\u201d\nWhat is this emotional restraint, and\nwhy is it related to the size of your brain?\n\u201cI wish we knew!\u201d says Dunbar \u201cIt is\nclearly something to do with the capacity to process relationships. In part, this\nis a time problem, because you have to\ninvest time in a relationship to make it\nwork at a certain level of quality.\u201d\n\u201cBut there is a cognitive constraint\ntoo. We have recently shown that the\nsize of your social network correlates\nboth your competences\non metalizing skills\n(the ability to understand what others are\nthinking) and the size\nof core areas of the\nbrain involved in\nmetalizing com-petences. So this\nlooks like a processing\ncapacity constraint.\u201d\nAlthough we do not\nfully understand why,\nit seems that the fundamental wiring of our\nbrains prohibits us from\nincreasing our social\nnetwork size. Why do we have so many\nonline friends if we cannot cognitively\nfacilitate everyone? \u201c150 isn\u2019t the limit\non the number of people you can know,\njust on the number you can have a personalised relationship with,\u201d Dunbar ex-plains. \u201cThe [other people you know] are\npeople you recognise, but the quality of\nrelationships is different and impersonal.\n1500 is around the limit of the number of\nfaces you can put names to. You can always add more friends to your Facebook\npage, but this doesn\u2019t make all of them\nfriends in the true sense. They are more\nlike voyeurs onto your social world.\u201d\nAnother of Path\u2019s aims is that, by limiting users to 50 friends, members will\npost more personal moments of their\nlives. This concept was inspired by the\nwork of Nobel-winning behavioural\neconomist Daniel Kahneman.\nHe studied the nature of memories and experiences relating\nto happiness, quantitatively demonstrating\nthat our perception of happiness\nis often skewed by\nwhat we last experienced\nrather than the entire expe-rience. The creators of\nPath are reported to have\nheard Kahneman speak\nearly in 2010, and decided to make their network\none where more personal\nmemories could be shared.\nDoes this mean the online relationship\non Path is better quality? As Path is so\nnew, this remains to be seen. However,\nit is worth examining whether online\nrelationships are of equal value to those\nin the physical world. This is relatively\nunknown territory, but more research in\nthis area is taking off. Aleks Krotoski,\na technology journalist and academic,\nhas extensively researched the social\npsychology of online relationships. She\nbelieves that if you want to understand\nwhether friendships are different online\ncompared to offline than you need to\nget to \u201cthe nitty gritty of what defines\nfriendship, you have to look at the psychological features of closeness.\u201d One\narea she examines is trust.\nIn her PhD thesis, Krotoski studied\npeople who used Second Life, and questioned them thoroughly on the issue of\ntrust. She found a whole spectrum of\ndifferent degrees of closeness between\npeople who didn\u2019t know each other of-fline, and \u201cthat this closeness developed\nin the same way as offline friendships\nand relationships develop: through shar-ing, through disclosure, through reciprocation of personal information and\nthrough perceptions of similarity.\u201d In\norder words, people found new methods\nto develop values essential for friendship and have close relationships.\nBut this doesn\u2019t answer whether online relationships are equivalent to those\nAn AntiSocial Path?\nElizabeth Crouch takes a look at the new social network that argues\nfewer friends leads to more meaningful relationships\nin the physical world. Robin Dunbar has\nrecently completed studies looking at\nhow different modes of online social interaction affect relationship quality.\n\u201cNone of the digital modes yields the\nsame relationship satisfaction as face-to-face interaction, with the possible\nexception of Skype,\u201d Dunbar explained.\n\u201cWhat seems to be critical, however,\nis the amount of laughter you do in the\nprocess. [However], trust is crucial to all\nrelationships, online or face-to-face, and\nis built up through interacting frequently\nand by the signals we give off.\u201d\nThe amount of time we spend online,\nand the relationships we establish, is a\ncontroversial topic. Currently, it appears\nthat our brains are not physically capable\nof supporting larger friendship circles\nand our social structure appears to be the\nsame online and offline. However, the\nscientific evidence that supports this also\nshows that we already only keep in touch\nwith a core group of friends online and, if\nusers are proactive, then they can select\nwho sees their information. It is possible\nthat Path is simply a more convenient\nway to share moments with those who\nactually mean something to you.\nThe important question that remains\nunanswered is whether the same value\ncan be attributed to online friendships as\nthose in the physical world. Here, Path\nwill be judged along with all social networking sites; none of the scientific principles on which it is based will alter that!\nFELIX 13\nFriday 21 JANUARY 2011\nHamish Muir\n\n"

Many of the protestors were\nunhappy about the fact that several ministers from\nMr. Ali\u2019s RCD party have kept their jobs. Riot police\nwas deployed in central Tunis as people gathered\nto voice their dissatisfaction with the new Government and there were fresh riots in other parts of\nthe country. Tunisia is in a state of civil unrest following widespread protests over corruption, high\nunemployment and high food prices which toppled\nMr. Ben Ali. Other Arab leaders are watching events\nin Tunisia with concern amidst fears that they could\ninspire similar revolts in their countries.\nChina\nHuman rights groups have urged the Haitian government to arrest and prosecute former President\nJean-Claude Duvalier for abuses committed during\nhis 1971-86 leadership. Mr Duvalier, who is commonly known as Baby Doc, inherited his father\u2019s regime at the age of 19 and stands accused of corrup-tion, embezzlement and human rights abuses during\nhis brutal rule which relied on a militia known as the\ntontons to maintain control of Haiti through fear and\nviolence.\nTunisia\nChinese President Hu Jintao has arrived in the\nWashington today, marking the start of a four day\nlong state visit to the United States. President Hu\nis expected to discuss trade, currency and a host of\nother issues which include North Korea with President Obama. Chinese state media reported that\nPresident Hu would stress on how a constructive,\ncomprehensive partnership between the powers\ncould be mutually beneficial and help ensure worldwide stability. President Hu\u2019s visit is set amidst a\nbackdrop of increasing trade tensions between the\ntwo powers with some US senators introducing a\nbill to penalise China for manipulating its currency,\nwhich critics say gives China an unfair advantage.\nWe are approaching a time when Holocaust\nsurvivors and other eye witnesses of the largest\nmass murder in modern history will no longer\nbe alive. On Tuesday 25th January, it will be\nboth an honour and a privilege to have Holocaust survivor Mrs Lily Ebert among us, to tell\nus her experiences, on the occasion of Holocaust Memorial Day.\nFrom 1933 to 1945, Nazi Germany, headed\nby Adolf Hitler led the systematic persecution\nand murder of Jews, gypsies, the handicapped,\nhomosexuals, Jehovah\u2019s witnesses, Soviet prisoners of war and political dissidents. People it\nconsidered politically, racially or socially \u201cunfit\u201d.\nIt is the mission of Holocaust Memorial Day\nand of the dissemination of Lilly Ebert\u2019s story\nto advance and propagate the knowledge of this\ngenocide. The aim is to preserve the memory\nof the millions who were murdered and to encourage reflection of the moral and spiritual\nquestions raised by these events, as well as to\nrecognise our responsibilities as students of a\nrenowned university and citizens of democ-racy.\nRemembering the Holocaust and listening\nto testimonies like Lilly Ebert\u2019s are a call to\nthe conscience of our world. This massacre occurred in the heart of Europe, in what was regarded as a civilised, modern nation. It was the\nconsequence of the silence of people who followed orders without question. Who watched\nand did nothing. Pastor Martin Niem\u00f6ller famously said,\n\u201cThey came first for the Communists, and I\ndidn\u2019t speak up because I wasn\u2019t a Communist.\nThen they came for the trade unionists, and I\ndidn\u2019t speak up because I wasn\u2019t a trade union-ist.\nThen they came for the Jews, and I didn\u2019t\nspeak up because I wasn\u2019t a Jew.\nThen they came for me and by that time no\none was left to speak up.\u201d\nIt is by keeping alive the memory of what\nhappened that we make sure we aren\u2019t the silent ones standing by, contributing to the suffering of others.\nIn 1945, nobody thought there would be\nanother holocaust. Yet we have been and are\nwitnesses to the persecution of people in Bosnia, Ruanda and Darfur because of their eth-nicity.\nJoin us in order to learn a powerful lesson in\nthe fragility of freedom and the need for vigilance in preserving democratic values.\nWe are the last generation who will be able\nto hear from a Holocaust survivor.

The key point of contention is in the title of the bill discussed- \u2018The\nParliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill\u2019 groups together reforms to the way\nwe vote for MPs along with the number and\nborders of constituencies. At the time of writ-ing, the bill was still not settled, although the\nfront bench members were talking again.\nLabour Peers object to the two issues being\nbundled into one piece of legislation, as they\nbelieve the government\u2019s plans to reduce the\nnumber of MPs would hit Labour dispropor-tionately. However they say that if the bill were\nto be split, then the part concerning the change\nto the voting system could be passed much\nmore quickly. Following clear messages from\nCameron and Clegg that they were determined\nthe bill would pass, it appeared that the Labour\nPeers would back down especially if modest\nconcessions could be made on the size or number of constituencies.\nMany Labour MPs approve of the alternative\nvote system, but object to the grouping with the\nchange in constituencies and for some reason\nhaving the vote on the same day as local elections The government argues it has paired the\ntwo issues together because both are about how\nMPs are elected to the House. A more cynical\nview would be that as the issues were linked in\nthe coalition agreement they are both required\nto pass simultaneously for political purposes in\nholding the coalition together.\nThe Peers have rejected claims that they are\nfilibustering the bill- wasting time until it is too\nlate to pass the bill with time to organise the\nvote for May 5th. The accusations clearly had\nfoundation especially after one Peer spent quite\na while discussing the history of the Venerable\nBede- a monk from the 7th century.\nNick Clegg, amongst others, accused Ed\nMilliband of tactically using his \u201cdinosaurs\u201d in\nthe Lords to prevent the public from deciding\nwhether to change the voting system- another\nallegation that was vehemently denied.\nIt could also be said that some Peers are\nholding the bill up to show the government\nthey won\u2019t just be a rubber stamp when it\ncomes to changes to parliament \u2013 setting up\nthe inevitable defiance for when Lib Dem\nhopes for a predominantly elected Lords\nmake it as far.\n\u201cI have strong feelings on constituency boundary issues\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "18\nCOM M ENT\nfelix\nFRIDAY 21 January 2011\nI\npassed my viva a few months ago.\nThe day before my 27th birthday,\ncoincidentally. This should have\nmarked the beginning of the next\nstage in my life but I now feel\nstrangely confused, unable to move on.\nWhere is my life going and all that? I\u2019m\nhoping this article will have a cathartic\neffect. Writing for my former university\npaper to help me move on might seem\nironic but this is not some purely ego-maniacal exercise. I\u2019m sure others are\ngoing through a similar experience, or\nwill go through it on graduating from\nuniversity. So this article is dedicated\nto you.\nFirst a small digression. You may have\nnoticed the bright set of abstract paintings on the ground floor of the central\nlibrary. These were donated by an artist\nnamed Bob Brighton. A plaque situated\nopposite the library helpdesk states that\n\u201csince becoming a professional artist\nin 1983 he [Bob Brighton] has given\nmost of his work away and lived a frugal existence on the dole.\u201d This plaque\nflummoxed me. Here was Imperial, promoting this guy who\u2019s decided to completely break with the system, forget\nabout remuneration and live on the dole\ninstead, and proclaim it proudly too. I\nknow the paintings came for free, but\nwhat the hell was Imperial thinking?!\nNow me, I have always lived to the\nsystem. I worked hard on my equations,\ndid lots of extra-curricular activities and\nI kept my weight in check. I had a Plan; I\nwas going to be an academic. The work\nis interesting, can have some higher purpose and it\u2019s cool telling people you\u2019re a\nphysicist. I wasn\u2019t looking to be the next\nLord Robert Winston, just somebody respected in my field. Maybe my own research group in some former polytech-nic. That\u2019s \u201cThe Plan\u201d. Not much, but I\ndo have to keep things realistic.\nBut now it seems that I just can\u2019t be\nbothered.\nAcademics work hard. I mean really\nhard. Forget Saturdays for the next few\nyears if you want to get that permanent\npost at some time in the future. And\neven after that it doesn\u2019t get much easier\nif you want to be half-successful. And\nit\u2019s the same for the other jobs I have\nbeen looking into; teaching, software\nengineering, management consultancy\u2026 Do I really want all that hassle?\nI am currently working as a tutor.\nWorking just one day a week is enough\nfor a frugal but stress-free existence, \u00e0\nla Bob Brighton. And it seemed to work\nout just fine for him. Sometimes I want\nto hit my head against a wall if the kid\nis particularly dense but they usually\nimprove with time. Most importantly,\ntutoring gives me all the time in the\nworld to do what I really want to do.\nI\u2019m still working out exactly what that\nis; as you can see I have a problem with\ndecision-making.\nBut being a tutor wasn\u2019t part of \u201cThe\nPlan\u201d! And it\u2019s not a real career! (no disrespect to career tutors out there). And\nthere\u2019s the British taxpayers I have to\nconsider. They kindly paid for my university education out of their pocket,\nsurely I owe it to them to get a job that (a)\nuses the scientific and analytical skills\nthey equipped me with to serve the British economy and (b) is in the higher tax-Repainting the plan\nband? It did make me think about the\nwhole university fee thing, whether it\u2019s\nsuch a bad idea after all. In theory, with\nthe current system I wouldn\u2019t need to reimburse the fees until I earned a certain\namount but you get my drift.\nIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t tried. I have\nfilled in a couple of job applications.\nThere\u2019s also some papers my supervisor wants me to write on my research,\nwhich should make me more employ-able. But the energy and ambition isn\u2019t\nthere anymore. Reading Bob Brighton\u2019s\nplaque didn\u2019t suddenly shatter \u201cThe\nPlan\u201d (that would be silly). It just proved\nthere were so many options out there,\nand not necessarily conventional ones.\nI just don\u2019t know.\nSoumaya always followed her life plan, but an aimless\nartist type has made her reconsider if she really needs to\nA College committee, the unimaginatively\nnamed \u2018working group on the extension of\nthe College Day\u2019, is investigating a number\nof changes to the timetable, which, if im-plemented, would change Imperial for the\nworse. The proposals are to extend postgraduate teaching to 8pm on Mondays and\nThursdays, extend undergraduate teaching\nto 8am-7pm on Mondays and Thursdays, reduce the lunch break to only one hour and\nto offer humanities options in the evenings\nfrom 6pm-8pm.\nThe motivation for these ideas seems\nsimple enough. There is a finite amount of\nspace on campus and a great deal of demand for that space. The task of timetabling\nthe myriad classes, activities and lectures\nthat occur on campus is extremely difficult\nand certainly unenviable.\nIt\u2019s tempting to think that with an extra\nhour here or there, the immense task of\njuggling all of the competing demands for\nspace would be made substantially easier.\nPerhaps it would, but what is clear is that\nsuch a change, however tempting it may be,\nwould throw up a host of needless and potentially insuperable problems.\nTake the idea of having 8am lectures.\nMost students at Imperial live 30 minutes\nor more from campus, which means that a\nconscientious student hoping to be 10 minutes early would need to wake up between\n6-7am. That\u2019s assuming that all Imperial\nstudents are so punctual. It is well known\nthat 9am lectures are rather poorly attended\nwhen compared to those in the afternoon.\nThis effect would only be exaggerated at\n8am. And what of the lecturer? Many live\nmuch further from campus than their stu-dents. Can it actually be expected that they\nwill leave their families at 6am, maybe 5am,\nto teach a lecture that will only be sparsely\nattended by their students?\nAdmittedly, this is the worst of the pro-posals, but the others are open to similarly\nunfortunate interpretations. Lectures later\nin the day would reduce the availability of\ndepartmental rooms for use by Clubs & Societies while those athletic students who\nare committed to their sports team would increasingly face the difficult choice between\nskipping their lectures or missing out on participating in a sport that they love.\nThe College must of course innovate and\nbe unafraid to make changes where they\nbring about a positive outcome. Blue-sky\nthinking should be encouraged and the demand on space on campus is a problem that\nrequires an imaginative solution. Admittedly,\nFelix does not have the magic solution. But\nthe status quo is far preferable to the Imperial that would be created by these propos-als. They are, as they stand, deeply unim-aginative, unjustified, and to the detriment\nof both students or staff. They should be\nrejected.\nFELIX\nSoumaya Mauthoor\n8am lectures?

After speaking to an excit-ed, and clearly inebriated, fresher who\nsaid \u2018This is shit, I\u2019m going home\u2019, it\nwas obvious that this was a night not to\nbe missed.\nI walk into the main drinks bar place\ncalled Five Seven One? Seven Eight\nSix? Oh it\u2019s Five Six Eight because\nthat\u2019s how many millimetres make up\na pint! Hilarious! The witty name alone\ngave me some indication of just how\nfunny some of the students at Imperial College London are. For instance,\none rather large oafish topless football\nplayer compared my drinking of wine to\nthe habits of a homosexual male, which\nof course had me in stitches of laughter.\nI then stared in amazement as the\nwhole football team managed to each\nimbibe a whole pint of alcoholic beverage by continu- ously gulping\nuntil the whole glass was\nempty. The abil- ity to drink\nfast is appar- ently recognised in the sporting\ncommunity as a feat\nof endurance, despite the fact that nothing is really enduring anything because\ndrinking is a natural human function. I\nguess the liver has to process the toxins,\nbut if it were all about liver endurance,\nsurely they would simply take turns to\ninject pure alcohol into their veins and\nsee who can live the longest. I have to\nadmit that I would be more impressed if\nthey were downing pints of bleach.\nI then walk outside and find an alternate reality to the world of Nine Three\nEight. Instead of loud, unintelligible and\ndiscordant songs about downing pints\nand sucking dicks, I found a crowd of\nbabbling intellectual high-functioning\nsmokers. I sat down and asked one for\nhis name, to which he replied, \u2018what\ndoes my name mean to you? A name is\njust a name; it\u2019s doing something with\nyour name that gives it meaning.\u2019 And\nthen he took a drag from his cigarette and\nbreathed out with deliberate slowness,\nas if giving me ample time to digest his\ntwatty attempt at philosophical proverb.\nI go into the Union nightclub sort of\nthing called Metric, WHICH IS FUNNY\nBECAUSE WE\u2019RE FROM IMPERIAL\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. It would seem that the overwhelming male majority were trying to solicit coitus from the small population\nof visually displeasing girls. It\u2019s always\nthe same visually displeasing girls who\ngo to Metric, so I\u2019m assuming that the\nrugby/football team have some sort of\nrota system for determining who gets to\ntake them home. The stench of sweat,\nego and visually displeasing girls is\nenough to make me vomit. Thankfully a\nChristian Volunteer group were standing\nby with a bucket, but I chose the floor\nbecause I\u2019m Indie and non-conformist.\nAny passer-by could question the true\ncalibre of Imperial\u2019s finest minds, but\nthen most of Imperial\u2019s finest minds are\nin their rooms wanking over Schrodinger. And I can\u2019t be too critical of the\nsporting teams because that is a damn\ngood rota-system they\u2019ve got going.\nHangman needs\nnew writers. If\nyou think you\u2019re\nfunny, you\u2019re\nprobably not.\nIf you don\u2019t think\nyou\u2019re funny and\njust sit in your\nroom crying and\nmasturbating,\nyou\u2019re probably\nperfect, so give\nme an email:\nhangman@ic.ac.\nuk\nWHOOAA.

Last week Edward Woollard, who threw a fire extinguisher from the roof of Millbank and\nwas identified on video footage by his\nridiculous hair, was sentenced to 32\nmonths in jail. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin\nQC, who oversaw the case, stated that\n\u201cthe right of peaceful protest is a precious one. Those who abuse it and use\nthe occasion to indulge in serious violence must expect a lengthy sentence\nof immediate custody\u201d \u2013 a warning to\nparticipants in future protests. After the\nMillbank occupation NUS President\nAaron Porter tweeted his disgust at \u201ca\nminority of idiots trying to undermine\n50,000 who came to make a peaceful\nprotest.\u201d On the other hand Clare Solomon, ULU president, denied the Millbank protest was extremist or unrepresentative of the movement as a whole.\nDespite the vote having been decided\nin December, and the law passed, protests are planned to take place later this\nmonth and in February. Porter said he\nexpected to see \u201ccontinued student pro-tests, sit-ins and petitions in the new\nyear\u201d. He said that students must accept\nthe law has been passed and that now is\nthe time to pressure university management directly to force a decision by their\nfinance departments to only raise tuition\nfees to \u00a36,000 rather than the maximum\n\u00a39,000. Solomon urged students to \u201ctake\nthe action up a notch\u201d and cause \u201cmaximum disruption\u201d to the higher education\nsystem in occupations and protests.\nThe Guardian reported this week that\ncounter-terrorism police have contacted\n20 London universities, including Imperial, for any intelligence about upcoming\ntuition fees protests. The news has been\nmet with hostility. Though it\u2019s hardly\nsurprising that the police are trying to\nfind out details of any plans early, many\nstudents feel vilified as potential terrorists for exercising their right of protest,\na fact that Porter finds \u201cworrying\u201d. Solomon defended the upcoming protests,\nsupporting \u201cvigorous occupations\u201d as\n\u201ca long established tradition in the student movement\u201d. At the time of writ-ing, Imperial College London had not\nconfirmed, or denied, that they had been\ncontacted by counter-terrorism police.\nIn contrast to the student unions of\nother London universities, which have\nsupported or organised protest events,\nImperial\u2019s Student Union has kept a distance from the protests. The Union released a statement last year confirming\nthat it \u201cbroadly supports the proposals of\nthe Browne Review\u201d and perhaps this is\nthe reason for the lack of action at Imperial. Alex Kendall, whilst wholeheartedly supporting the right of peaceful protest and freedom of speech, condemned\nthe violence of the previous protests and\nsome students\u2019 behaviour as \u201chideous\u201d.\nThough some protests were planned\nby members of the student body they\nfizzled out before gaining any real momentum around campus. So even if Imperial staff did decide to turn informer\nand gossip to the police they\u2019d probably\nnot have much to chat about anyway.\nVictoria Druce\nMiles Robertson\nWe might see a bit more of this kind of thing, who knows? All I know is\nthat the baby blue cap TOTALLY doesn\u2019t go with the high-vis\nKennedy Institute to close\nLeading rheumatology research centre moves to Oxford University\nThe Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, one of the world\u2019s leading research\ncentres in rheumatology, currently\nhoused within the Faculty of Medicine\nof Imperial College will be relocated\nto Oxford University in what Felix has\nbeen told is a sensitive matter for the\nFaculty.\nIn November last year, an announcement was made detailing the collaboration between Oxford University and the\nKennedy Institute Trust. The construction of a new rheumatology research\ncentre at Oxford means that the sizeable grants awarded to Imperial through\nthe Kennedy Institute will no longer be\nDeepka Rana\nIan Wei\navailable.\nA spokesperson for Imperial College\nLondon reassured Felix that no jobs\nwere at risk.\nProfessor Sir Marc Feldmann, the\ncurrent director of the Kennedy Institute at Imperial, told Felix that the\nmove had been known about for approximately 2 years but declined to\ncomment further.\nA spokesman for Arthritis Research\nUK, one of the main funders of the\nKennedy Institute stated that this\nwasn\u2019t the first move for the Kennedy\nInstitute and that it wasn\u2019t unusual for\nresearch grants to move as they de-velop. They insisted that they have a\n\u201clongstanding relationship with Imperial and fund a significant amount of\n[other] work at Imperial.\u201d The spokesman added that Arthritis Research UK\n\u201cbelieve in working with the best talent\nthat the UK has to offer\u201d.\nThe Kennedy Institute has enjoyed\nsuccess and contributed significantly to\nthe field with important research such as\nthe discovery of TNF\u03b1 (Tumour Necro\u201cShould you pick\nup any relevant\ninformation [...]\nplease forward it\nonto me.\u201d\nReported email from\nCounter Terrorism Unit\nsis Factor), a type of protein that plays a\nlarge part in a specific type of arthritis.\nThis led to the realisation that blocking\nthis protein can alleviate the symptoms\nof the condition.\nThe Directors of the Kennedy Institute\nhave also enjoyed global recognition,\nreceiving several awards each. Notably, Professor Sir Feldmann received\na knighthood in the Queen\u2019s Birthday\nHonours list last June.\nThe Kennedy Institute was first\nformed in 1965 with a foundation gift\nfrom the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology Trust formerly known as the\nMathilda and Terence Kennedy Institute\nof Rheumatology Trust (Mathilda being the daughter of Marks & Spencer\nfounder Michael Marks) and the original site was found in Bute Gardens. In\n1997, Arthritis Research UK relocated\nthe Institute closer to the medical school\nat Charing Cross Hospital.\nThe Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology is currently based at\nImperial\u2019s Charing Cross campus\n\u201cA spokesperson\nfor Imperial College\nLondon reassured\nFelix that no jobs\nwere at risk.\u201d\n\n"

Wooden Shjips\nare a Space/Drone/Psychadelic rock\nband hailing from San Francisco. This\nwas my second time seeing the band, the\nfirst having been at Green Man in 2009.\nThe band has an intelligent, spacey,\nzoned feel, but it\u2019s not for everyone.\nPerhaps the most immediately recognisable aspect of this gig was the facial\nhair. Solid efforts were made from all\nbands, but Erik \u201cRipley\u201d Johnson of\nWooden Shjips and Moon Duo brought\nthis aspect of the night\u2019s entertainment to\na stunning climax, sporting a beard that\nwould make Getafix the Druid proud.\nDusty Jermier on the Wooden Shjips\u2019\nbass followed a similar line, modelling\npigtails and a moustache reminiscent of\nObelix.\nWooden Shjips were supported by\nMoon Duo and Howlin Rain, a band\nnew to me, who played powerful guitar\ndriven rock evocative of a 70s Lynyrd\nSkynyrd (but beards more of the Iron &\nWine school). Aquick search on Spotify\nfor their name is well worth the effort.\nThe evening was appreciated by\na crowd consisting of a surprisingly\neclectic age range. Towards the end of\nthe night, a small group of men dancing as though nobody was looking\nwas seen to nucleate at the front of the\nvenue, although the activation energy\nwasn\u2019t reached for most not to remain\ncontent to bob their heads to the atmo-It turns out that the BRMC have been\nturning out their brand of stripped-down\ngarage rock, more reminiscent of the\nNew York scene than that of their native\nCalifornia, for a decade now.

Still, they aren\u2019t a bad night\u2019s\nentertainment \u2013 the band, at the end of\na long tour, put on a decent show and\nrattled through their back catalogue at\nmachine-gun speed, complete with a\npleasing (if incongruous) laser show.\n\u2018Rock & Roll\u2019 is dead\nSuffering from a lack-spirited fearlessness, contoversy and attitude,\nthe withering genre of \u2018Rock and Roll\u2019 music is feared to be losing\nits roots and nearing its end\nReach for the lasers, man.\nIf anything, though, the speed was part\nof the problem. They can clearly play\nand play well, but their self-consciously\nminimalist style means they don\u2019t seem\nto want to, substituting playing simple\nriffs at a million miles an hour for doing\nanything more complex or involving. It\nalso meant that they cleared their set-list\nin a breathless sixty minutes before moving onto a forty-five minute encore, a\ncrime more befitting Axl Rose\u2019s bloated\nand monstrous ego than a self-professed\nno-bullshit rock band. Still, the bizarrely\nmiddle-aged crowd lapped it up, and\neven attempted one of the world\u2019s slowest and most optimistic mosh-pits as the\nset reached its climax. All in all, a show\nfor the dedicated fan only, but if you can\ncheck them out at a festival, where the\nshort stage times might better suit their\nstyle, they\u2019d be worth a look.\n\u2018Rock & Roll\u2019\n\u2013 It\u2019s time to\ntoughen up!\nspheric drones and pulsating bass line\nof Wooden Shjips songs like We ask\nyou to ride and Aquarian Time. The\ndrones were embellished with catchy\nguitar riffs and the neatly placed keyboard work of Nash Whalen. The highlight of the act for me however was the\nenergetic drum beat that accompanied\nsong after song.\nIt would feel slightly wrong not to\ngive a full picture of the gig, and it must\nbe admitted that listening to drone rock\nfor this kind of a period can give rise to\nquite a significant headache. It is not\nas though Wooden Shjips mindlessly\nbludgeon your head as one might with\na pneumatic drill or similar blunt instru-ment, but cranial penetration is self-evidently achieved.

New research shows creepy crawlies produce significnatly less methane and nitrous oxide\nthan traditional livestock; gases which have a greater warming effect than carbon dioxide. The authors\nof the research say that insects are an \u201cexcellent\nfood source\u201d and are eaten in over 80% of the\nworld\u2019s countries. So while the thought of climate\nchange might leave you with a sinking feeling in the\npit of your stomach, we doubt eating insects and\nworms will likely help the situation much.\nI\u2019m going to be a little self-indulgent this week, with\na book that triggered my interest in physics. The\nnew world of Mr Tompkins is a revised version of\nGamow\u2019s classic, bringing the witty and engaging\nstory of Mr Tompkins up to date with current phys-ics. Taking the reader on a whirlwind tour through\nrelativity, quantum mechanics, antimatter and black\nholes, Mr Tompkins provides an endearing medium\nfor the authors to explain some complicated ideas.\nThe physics is, of course, the backbone of the book\nbut it reads like a novel, with Mr Tompkins\u2019 plight\nfor romance and love bringing the characters to life.\nGamow was one of the most significant physicists\nof the last century but also had a unique gift for\npopularising science; Stannard is equally prolific as\na science communicator today. Between the two of\nthem they are able to pull apart the foundations of\nphysics and explain the intricacies whilst we watch\nthem being put back together.\nKatya-Yani Vyas\nNew gene heralds inflammation cures\nBen Good\nInflammation is a major cause and constituent of many different conditions and scientists\nbelieve they have identified a \u201cmaster switch\u201d\nprotein that could hold the key to new treatments for these diseases.\nThe immune inflammatory response is a vital\npart of the body\u2019s reaction to potential dam-age, whether that be infectious or due to other\nstimuli. This process is the responsibility of immune cells known as macrophages. These cells\nhave a dual role, able to stimulate or suppress\ninflammation depending on what chemicals the\ncell secretes into the tissues.\nHowever, despite the defensive intentions of\nthe inflammatory response, in many conditions\nit is the inflammation that is the main cause of\nsymptoms and complications.\nA team from Imperial College London has\ncome up with a potential new way to control\nthe inflammatory response. There results indicate that a protein, known as Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), is the \u201cmaster switch\u201d\nresponsible for the role of macrophages in in-flammation.\nIf this protein is blocked it could have potential therapeutic benefits for several different conditions including rheumatoid arthritis,\nFriday 21 JANUARY 2011\nlupus and multiple sclerosis.\nA senior researcher who worked on this\nstudy, Dr Irina Udalova, said \u201cDiseases can\naffect which genes are switched on and off in\nparticular types of cells.\nUnderstanding how this switching is regulated is crucial for designing targeted strategies\nto suppress unwanted cell responses.\u201d\nIRF5 was targeted after gene association\nstudies linked variations in the protein to autoimmune diseases. The study itself was carried\nout using genetic technology to introduce more\ncopies of the genes encoding for IRF5 into in-vitro cells. After this they were able to observe\nthat the macrophages with anti-inflammatory\ncharacteristics given additional copies of IRF5\npromoted inflammation. As well as this, they\nfound that by blocking IRF5 with synthetic\nmolecules they could block the inflammatory\neffects.\nDr Udalova summed up the potential of the\nstudy by saying \u201cThis is really exciting, because it could give us new anti-inflammatory\ntreatments for a wide variety of conditions.\u201d\nMaciej Matuszewski\nTime lapse photographs, such as this, are helping scientists discover new meteorites\nShooting the stars to find meteorites\nThe finding of a new meteorite in Western Australia\u2019s Nullarbor Desert has been announced\nby an international group of scientists, led by\nImperial\u2019s Dr Philip Bland. This was achieved\nusing the Desert Fireball Network, a project involving the Onarejov Observatory in the Czech\nRepublic, the Western Australia Museum, Curtin University, Perth, as well as Imperial College. The Network consists of a number of film\nbased cameras, used because the available digital cameras do not have a good enough resolu-tion, spread out over several thousand square\nkilometres of the desert. Each takes time lapse\nphotographs of the night sky, the film of which\nis sent by local farmers back to the researchers\nto be developed and studied. The clear Australian sky allows useful photos to be taken almost\nevery night. If a meteorite fireball appears in\nmore than one picture the scientists are able to\ncalculate not only its previous orbit, but, using climate models, also where it landed. The\nsystem is so accurate that the position of the\nlatest find was calculated to be just 150m from\nits true location.\nWhile this is not the first such tracking system to be set up, it is the first in the Southern\nHemisphere and the first which allows easy\nretrieval of the meteorites. The dry, featureless\ndesert means that they remain undisturbed in\nthe months between the scientists\u2019 visits and\nthat they are easy to spot when the researchers\ndo arrive. Dr Bland has said that \u201cother teams\nhave encountered problems because meteorites\nare small rocks and they\u2019re quite hard to find\nin vegetated areas\u201d. The new meteorite, only\nthe size of a fifty pence piece and a deep black\ncolour, would have been very difficult to locate\nhad it not contrasted so well with the flat, white\nlimestone of the Nullarbor.\nKnowing the composition of the meteorites\nas well as where they came from can tell scientists a lot about the formation of the Solar\nSystem. This project is very significant as there\nhave previously only been about a dozen meteorites whose orbits have been recorded. The\nonly other alternative which can collect the\nsame data, sending probes out into space, is\nseveral times more expensive.\nThe team\u2019s previous find, the first using the\nequipment, was the Bunburra Rochole meteor-ite, samples of which were recovered in 2008\nand 2009 after it fell on the 20 July 2007. It had\na very unusual orbit and composition and provided evidence for a theory of how planetesi-mals, large asteroids which were the building\nblocks of planets, may have been formed in the\ninner Solar System.\nMacrophages are responsible for regulating the body\u2019s immune response\n\n"

Two busloads\nof students spent 22 hours travelling to\nthe Alps on New Year\u2019s Day, most still\nsuffering from the revelries of the night\nbefore. However, duty free alcohol and\na port to port challenge tempted people\nback over to the dark side with one bus\nhaving a bit too much fun \u2013 and as the\ntrip\u2019s Worried Mum, I was called in to\nclean up the mess!\nHaving arrived safely, with rental pick\nup, and checked in to our cosy quarters\nit was soon time for us to check out the\nlocal. So, dressed to impress in some\ndelightful Christmas jumpers, a \u2018calm\u2019\nnight ended for most in the wee hours\nof the morning. Still, long nights out\ndoes not lead to lazy days on this trip\nand it was early starts all round to hit\nthe slopes! It\u2019s safe to say that despite\nthe snow blizzard that affected most of\nEurope, well, there wasn\u2019t much up the\nmountain! Sure it was great piste ski-ing, but off piste the snow was already\nshredded with rocks lying bare. Yet with\n140km of piste in Val Thorens and over\n600km in all three valleys \u2013 there was\nstill plenty to do and see.\nTuesday night was the night that will\ngo down in history for IC Snowsports \u2013\nImperial students took over a bar! Yes! I\nknow! How? Well, you know the classic\nfancy dress theme Cowboys vs. Indians? It\u2019s dated and quite frankly not P.C.\nSo on this historical night, we went to\na lovely place called Moo Bar as Cowboys vs. Cows. There was some serious effort put into the costumes which\ninspired some spontaneous rodeo, cow\ncongas, pole dancing, moshing and\nsome awesome dance moves (milking\nthe udders/grazing the grass).\nBack on the slopes and in true Imperial style, people were using their smart\nphones to clock their speed down runs.\nFriday 21 January 2011\nLuckily, we had rules in place for this\nand any \u2018Imperial\u2019(i.e. nerdy) comments\nwere reprimanded.All in all it was going\nwell, the beginners were making progress and there were some totally rad\nmoves being thrown in the park \u2013 can\nanyone say 5? \u2013 gnarly man, we\u2019re all\ntotally stoked! Some horrifically awesome retro ski wear was also spotted in\nthe park cruising alongside Super Cow.\nA brief moment of silence is required\nhere for our injured \u2013 one broken leg\nand a tragic incident with broken glass\nbeing left lying around a club ended up\nwith two hospital visits. However, neither were put off the sport nor clubbing.\nBy midweek it was established that the\ncommittee did not have food poisoning\n(attributed to the infamous \u2018poo beers\u2019)\nbut had the resort\u2019s stomach bug virus.\nCall in our only medic Dr. Simon! Oh\nwait he\u2019s ill.. How bout back-up option\nDr. Saftey? Nope he\u2019s ill, too. I\u2019d like to\ntake this opportunity to apologise if we\nbrought it back with us and it disrupts\nyour January Exams...\nThe final night saw us to the Mountain Meal. This is basically meat fondue,\nlots of wine, some half-naked dancing\nfollowed by an epic ski down the green\nslope back to the apartments. Now, most\ncan handle this night. Some can even\nski down with another person standing\non their skis \u2013 quite a skill. However,\nthere are always exceptions. The sight\nof one skier and one snowboarder getting clothe-lined by a face-height fence\nwas enough to send those watching into\na fit of hysterics! Look for those with\nred fence marks on their faces for the\nculprits. It was dark!! The last night was\nalso the event of the Felix centrefold\nphoto, which if it\u2019s not been published\nwill be Snowsport\u2019s second rejection for\ntoo much nudity. If you are feeling that\nsinking feeling of missing out, there\u2019s\nEaster\u2019s trip coming up and also next\nyear\u2019s January trip which promises to be\neven bigger!\nYoung Scientists\u2019\nSymposium 2010\nICSMSU Muslim Medics host another successful\nevening of academic prowess\nThe School of Medicine has always\nmaintained the importance of research\nwithin the medical field both as a student and once we graduate. On Tuesday\n23rd November ICSMSU Muslim Medics showcased the academic research\nachievements of Imperial students from\nall years. The tough competition from\n6 high-class presentations was indicative of the fact that the Young Scientist\u2019s\nSymposium (YSS), now in its 4th year,\nhad established itself as a renowned\nsymposium for medical students.\nThe lecture hall was packed out with\nImperial students from all years as well\nas year 12 and 13 students that were invited from the hugely successful PotMed\nthat took place in September. We were\nextremely privileged to have on our judging panel Dr Laki Buluwela, a reader in\nmolecular biology, Dr Ken MacLeod, a\nreader in cardiac physiology, and as our\nhead judge, Professor Chris Tang, a researcher in infectious diseases. All three\njudges had been lecturers within our first\ntwo years of Medicine and so it only\nseemed apt that we invite such honourable members of the medical school that\nthe presenters, and the rest of us, would\nnot only know but also regard as role\nmodels and people from whom we can\nlearn a great deal. In our company as a\nfourth judge we also had MohammedAlHairi, last year\u2019s audience winner, which\nwas indeed a pleasure for us all.\nThese final six contestants were to\ngive an eight minute presentation on\ntheir particular research topic followed\nby a maximum seven minutes of questions and answers from both the judging\npanel and the audience alike. At the end\nthe judges would deliberate who they\nthought was the best presenter based on\ncriteria of appearance, structure, scientific knowledge, delivery and evalua-tion. In addition, the audience would\nvote too on who they thought delivered\nthe best presentation. The challenge was\nto deliver very advanced research to an\naudience mainly made up of a younger\ncommunity that had little experience in\nthe chosen fields in such a manner that\nwas both engaging and refreshing. The\njudges\u2019 winner would an engraved glass\ntrophy and the audience winner would\nreceive a \u00a320 Waterstones voucher.\nThe excitement was brewing more\nand more as Dr MacLeod was ending\nhis presentation on the importance of\nmedical students to get involved in research from an early stage; the audience\nwere awaiting the first presentation and\nour excellent chair, Samee Siddiqui,\nnot only welcomed the proceedings in\na confident and motivating manner but\nalso eased the nerves with some of his\nbest jokes \u2013 undoubtedly the crowd\u2019s\nfavourite was remarking upon the effectiveness of Dr Buluwela\u2019s presentation\non how to give an effective presentation.\nThe topics covered in the ninety minutes showed an insight into the different\nareas of medicine such as David Bargiela\u2019s presentation on the role of astrocytes in multiple scleroris, Harsh Bhatt\u2019s\npresentation on unexpected stimuli affecting saccadic latency and ethnic marketing science, an area never discussed\nbefore at the symposium, delivered by\nAtif Khan. In the end there was very little separating the best two presentations\nof the evening: Bharat Pahilwani\u2019s fascinating talk on using cortisol to monitor hydrocortisone replacement and Reenam Khan\u2019s intriguing and refreshing\nlook at predicting post-operative pain\noutcomes, with the former winning the\naudience vote and the latter deservedly\nbeing crowned Young Scientist\u2019s Symposium 2010 winner by the judges.\nFor me the highlight of the evening\nwas not the enthralling presentations,\nthe chair\u2019s best lines or even the tasty\nsnacks, although all three were excellent\nin their own right, but the heart warming\nbrother and sisterhood that took place\nat the end between the contestants once\nthe results were announced. Normally\nat Imperial we see fellow colleagues\nleaving no stone unturned to be the best\nof the best whether it comes to passing\nexaminations, winning awards or getting work published. And because of\nthis competitiveness, that most probably arises from the fact that striving to\nbe top is part of the norm, we tend to\noverlook others\u2019 achievements and success and sometimes even our own if it\ndoesn\u2019t match up to others\u2019. But if you\nwere to be there at the end you would\nhave seen all the contestants not only\ncongratulating the winners but themselves too for they all have succeeded\nin delivering excellent presentations;\na point emphasised by Professor Chris\nTang at the end. And this is exactly what\nYSS aims to achieve: unity and a celebration of achievement amongst all students of this medical school.\nAnother thing to point out is how the\ncontestants were not just from 5th year\nlike the majority of previous sympo-siums, but ranged all the way from final\nyear to second year. Special mention\nmust go to Neha Panda, a second year\nmedic, who took part in research before\nshe attended the medical school \u2013 which\ncompletely encapsulates the Imperial students\u2019 enthusiasm to achieve and\nadvance not only their careers but the\nquality of life in the community which\nwithout doubt will be the foundations of\na successful healthcare service brought\nby the next generation: our generation.\nSimon Federer\nAamir Shamsi\nBilal Sahib\nYou know you love the pun on the opposite page...\n\n"
