    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n18 | Catnip 18 October 2024\nH\nello readers, for those who don\u2019t know me I was\nyour very modest Arts editor for two years at Felix,\nbut since they weren\u2019t paying me I decided to step\ndown. For those few people \u2013 and from my memory it\nwas very few \u2013 who read my articles, you may have appreciated my blunt yet self-proclaimed witty remarks\nwhen it came to art. Thus I unfortunately intend to continue in a similar vein but this time I shall apply it to the\neveryday.\nMy first offensive missive shall be on corporate\nminimalism. Corporate minimalism is the current 21st\ncentury trend that reminds you that the straight-white-man (such as myself) is still very much in charge when\nit comes to business. Gone are the days when companies strove to create a lasting image with a hint of pizzazz and ambiguity. Instead we are subjected to glorified nothingness in attempt to forcefully modernise the\nmost basic of living essentials, such as exclusive wine\nbars and artisan cafes, all to create that clean, clinical\nlook.\nThe best example to look at is the coffee shop. A\ndelight for many is walking into one\u2019s favourite coffee\nshop. Let\u2019s take Caffe Nero: you walk in to a lovely wood\npanelled cafe with books adorning each wall, maybe a\nlovely little picture set, and subtle, warm lighting that\nmakes you feel like your next cup of coffee is one that\u2019s\ngoing to make you stay a while (it is so bitter that you do\nnot want to drink it too quickly), maybe start that book\nyou\u2019ve been reading in public for three weeks, or that\nessay that\u2019s due in two days time. Compare that with\nthe minimalist behemoth that\u2019s taken over the London\ncoffee scene: Blank Street Coffee. You walk in and you\nare unsure whether you\u2019ve stepped into a coffee shop\nor a new-wave dermatology clinic, the lettering is in a\ncorporate sans serif typeface that screams Adobe rather\nthan arabica, and with all of that you half expect them\nto say, \u201cWould you like that in a cup or intravenously?\u201d\nOf course it\u2019s not just coffee shops. If you were to take\na walk down Camden High Street all you will see is row\nupon row of shops with black and white signs that have\na single brand name in Arial type in lettering that say\nsomething along the lines of \u201cArise,\u201d \u201cZenyth,\u201d (sic) or\n\u201cPlebs\u201d. What these shops sell you have no idea. Their\nsparse, minimal nature gives you nothing to elucidate\nwhat they sell either. Does Plebs sell coffee? Handbags\nmade of hemp? Maybe shoes? (Each shoe sold separate-ly). You do not know. Yet now every corporation has\ngone down the route of reducing their formally iconic logos into nonsensical abstract Rothkos that make\nEgyptian hieroglyphics look comprehensible.\nBut these types of shops and brand design have created a generation of \u201cblank supporters\u201d who trot down\nthe street in the colour palette of \u201csad beige baby,\u201d wearing long oatmeal coats and Burberry scarves \u2013 the socalled \u201cyummy mummy clean aesthetic\u201d. They display\nwheat-coloured paperback copies of Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar\nin their jeans backpockets \u2013 will they choose the corporate finance fig or the nepotistic marketing one? It is\nlight academia without the academia. These same people walk through Camden and try to pass it off as bohemian whereas if they were really bohemian they\u2019d be\nlying face down in an opium den which, for reference,\nwould be decorated most opulently.\nThiswholeschemeof\u201cneutralespressotones,\u201dstupid\nshop fronts, and meaningless photographable opportunities is playing into corporations\u2019 hands, who feel that\nby making things look aesthetically pleasing means\nthey can hike up prices; your coffee, which in any other part of the world would be \u00a32, is now \u00a34. You\u2019re now\npaying for the experience to have everything look like\u2026\nnothing. As a popular internet meme once said, \u201cMinimalism is just a scam by big small to sell more less.\u201d\nCATNIP\nMinimalism sucks\nProfessionalHater\nJILBERT GACKSON\nCatnip writer Jilbert returns with his highly-acclaimed column\n\u201cFuck this Shit\u201d\nSpecial thanks this week\nThank you to my drinking buddies Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. A special mention to my clinical psychiatrist for helping me with my bi-ble-induced psychosis. Thank you to my bible-induced psychosis for my clinical psychiatrists new car. Thank you William Morris for inventing\nWetherspoon pubs. Thank you William Morris for being the first mad socialist lad out on the Hammersmith town. Thank you William Morris for\nHammersmith and Fulham City Council in its current state, some fairly average poems, some banging patterns, and again most importantly\nthe best Imperial drinking hub. Love always to the lads that built the Babel penthouse, without you guys I wouldn\u2019t be writing this paper in\u00a0English. Regards to my lawyer for getting me off four counts of Union election fraud. Thank you to the mafia for getting me into four counts of\nunion election fraud. Thank you to this week\u2019s crossword writer without whom I\u2019d be 6 down. Thank you again to the mafia without whom I\nwouldn\u2019t be able to see my wife and kids again. Special thanks to the Demiurge for making the material world, without whom I wouldn\u2019t be here.\nThank you Beyonce, I dedicate my entire section to you. Feb Senton, you have my heart.\n\n"

Using tools\nfrom the discipline, they constructed\nmethods that laid the foundation for machine learning.\nJohn Hopfield, well known for developing the \u201cHopfield Network\u201d, created a\nstructure that can store and reconstruct\ninformation.\nGeoffery Hinton, also known as \u201cthe\nGodfather of AI\u201d, invented a method that\ncan independently discover properties\nin data, which has become an important\nfeature in large artificial neural networks\n(ANNs).\nANNs and machine learning date back\nto the 1940s, when Warren McCulloch,\nWalter Pitts and Donald Hebb proposed\nmechanisms describing how neurons in\nthe brain cooperate. Only within the past\nthree decades, these methods have been\ndeveloped into versatile and powerful\ntools for scientific applications. Inspired\nby neurons in the brain, ANNs are large\ncollections of nodes, analogous to neu-rons, each connected by weighted cou-plings, analogous to \u201csynapses\u201d, which\nare trained to perform certain tasks \u2013\nrather than carrying out a set of predetermined ones. The structure of ANNs\nis closely related to spin models seen in\nstatistical physics. This year\u2019s laureates\nexploited this connection to make breakthrough advances in ANNs.\nHopfield\u2019s seminal work in biological\nphysics in the 1970s examined electron\ntransfer between biomolecules and error correction in biochemical reactions.\nIn 1982, he published a paper describing\na dynamic, associative memory model\nbased on a simple neural network, called\nthe Hopfield network. This is a network\nthat can store patterns and is capable\nof recreating them. Hopfield likened\nhis pattern-searching network to a ball\nrolling down a landscape of peaks and\nvalleys. If a ball is dropped into the land-scape, it will roll into a valley. For a net-work, it is given a pattern, analogous to a\nball rolling down a hill into a valley \u2013 and\nwill search for the nearest pattern stored\nin its memory, analogous to a ball ending up at the bottom of the valley in the\nenergy landscape. When the network is\ntrained, it creates a valley in a virtual energy landscape for every saved pattern.\nFrom 1983 to 1985, Geoffrey Hinton\ndeveloped a stochastic extension of Hopfield\u2019s model, called the Boltzmann ma-chine. This is a generative module, which\nfocuses on statistical distributions of patterns rather than individual patterns.\nThese pioneering methods developed\nby the laureates have been instrumental\nin shaping the field of ANNs. Their work\nhas demonstrated a completely new way\nfor us to use computers in order to tackle\nscientific problems. ANNs now have become a standard data analysis tool used\nin astrophysics and astronomy. They\nwere used for the search of the Higgs boson in CERN, and most significantly - deep\nlearning ANNs methods are used in the\nAlphaFold tool for prediction of three-di-mensional protein structures, given their\namino acid sequences.\nThe laureates will pick up their awards\nat the Nobel award ceremony later this\nyear on 10th\nDecember.\nHopfield and Hinton awarded Nobel\nPrize for shaping the\nneural network landscape\nScienceWriter\nTAYLOR POMFRET\nTheir work has demonstrated a new\nway for us to use computers in order to\ntackle scientific problems.\n\u201c\nJohn Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton are recognised for their seminal work\nin artificial neural networks and machine learning.\nEnergy Landscape of a Hopfield Network.

I couldn\u2019t\nsleep, I couldn\u2019t read, and I certainly\ncouldn\u2019t work. I lay in bed, drowning in\nennui. Jolted up by a fire alarm at three\nin morning \u2013 a quintessential university experience \u2013 I deliriously found myself wandering over to the Abdus Salam\nLibrary instead of the fire safety zone.\nI had goosebumps on my arms, but the\nair was biting, and I enjoyed watching my\nbreath.\nThe library, naturally, wasn\u2019t as empty\nas I hoped. That was until I made my way\nup to Section 800 on the fifth floor: the\nliterature section.\nThe Abdus Salam Library is not like a\ntraditionallibrary.Althoughitpacksaflur-ry of activity (and you will be lucky to find\na seat at 4pm on any given day), the shelves\nare saturated with specialised STEM and\nmedical texts \u2013 as are the librarians, for\nwhom helping you is only a fraction of the\nrolethattheyplayinthewidercommunity.\nSpanning a meagre three shelves, the\nliterature section is not particularly ex-pansive. Still, I enjoyed perusing through\nthe shelves, brushing my fingers over the\nspine of each book as I walked by.\nInitially, I was a bit miffed with the lack\nof literature that I was under the impression library had available. But upon further digging, I discovered two key things\nthat enable me to continually enrich my\nbreadth of reading. One, Libby, an online\nplatform through Imperial that gives\nyou access to thousands of books for\nfree. And another, that I can request the\nlibrary to acquire a book I want to read.\nThat night, I left the library about an\nhour after the fire alarm had gone off.\nMy tiredness was catching up to me,\nbut equally, my listlessness had been\nreplaced with satiation. I walked out with\nthree books in hand: A Room with a View\nby E.M. Forster, The Lincoln Highway by\nAmol Towles, and Never Let Me Go by\nKazuo Ishiguro.\nI\u2019ve since grown more curious about\nthe people behind Abdus Salam, who\nwork tirelessly to make the library such\na conducive place, and offer services we\ncertainly take for granted.\nSo, here are merely a handful of the\npeople who work at the Imperial Library\nServices. Of course, accompanied by\ntheir book recommendation, because it\nwould go against my morals to not ask\na librarian for a suggestion of what to\nread.\nBOOKS\nThe People Powering\nAbdus Salam\nBooksEditor\nADITI MEHTA\nA short word from a handful of the Imperial College Library team, who we\nmay not see everyday, but whose presence is critical to our campus.\nI\u2019m Ella, and I work as an Acquisitions and Metadata Officer, part of the Content and\nDiscovery team at the Abdus Salam Library. I joined the Library in September 2023, and\nhave loved working here so far \u2013 my role is varied, I\u2019ve learnt a lot, and working with rare\nmaterial in our Special Collection brings lots of surprises.\nI tend to read books from a variety of genres, mostly fiction. One great aspect of my role is\nthat I get to see almost every print book we order for the Abdus Salam Library as it arrives,\nand as we\u2019ve been developing our fiction collection I now have a very long reading list!\nHaving said that, one book I read recently and loved was Stay True by Hua Hsu. It\u2019s a memoirthat\u2019sfunny,sad,moving,andcapturesthespecificityofyoungadulthoodbeautifully.I\ndon\u2019tbelieveinall-timefavourites\u2013myfavouritesaresubjecttochange\u2013butafictionbookI\ncandefinitelyrecommend,andonewehaveintheLibrary,isMonstriliobyGerardoS\u00e1mano\nC\u00f3rdova.

Through my\nexperience in the exercise, I uncovered\ntwo key insights that extend beyond the\nsimulation itself and into the domain\nof practical challenges businesses face.\nI then looked at the relevant business\nliterature to compare.\nThe best business plans\ncollide with reality - make\none still\nSimulation Situation: The utility of\na business plan was tested during the\nsimulation. Initially, my team began by\nstrategising, analysing all the available\ndata, and devising a plan that would\nposition us in the optimal location with\nthe ideal food selection. We decided to\nplace our truck near the college campus,\nserving ice cream. Confident in our\nchoice, backed by the data we submitted\nour selection\u2014only to discover that\nconstruction on campus significantly\nreduced foot traffic, which led to lower\nsales. All our carefully laid-out business\nplans were rendered ineffective.\nLiterature: If, in the immortal words\nof Steve Blank, famed entrepreneur\nand progenitor of the Lean Startup\nmethodology, \u201cNo business plan survives\nfirst contact with a customer,\u201d why does\nthe practice persist? A more expansive\nview suggests that the concept of a\nbusiness plan as a purely strategic\ndocument is uncorrelated with success.\nHowever, as a planning exercise that\nforces entrepreneurs to think through\nthe process of launching a new business,\nresearch validates its utility.\nBusiness plans create a mental model\nfor entrepreneurs and can help mitigate\ncognitive biases. Although the business\nplan is almost certainly subect to change,\nby creating this mental model, it allows\nentrepreneurs greater mental flexibility\nto adapt to changes. Interestingly, other\ntraditional business planning activities,\nsuch as \u201cgathering secondary data or\nsharing the business plan for feedback or\nfunding,\u201d are not correlated with success.\nAs an aside, the research validates my\nteam\u2019sdecisionnottopursuetheresearch\ngathering option in the simulation and\ninstead jump into prototyping by using\nthe cart in the first week. This allowed\nus to iteratively develop our business\nstrategyandexemplifiestheLeanStartup\nmethodology.\nPossess a healthy skepticism\nof analytics\nSimulation Situation: When\nfirst tasked with the simulation, my\nteammates and I referred to taste\npreferences published in the provided\nmarket data. However, we quickly\ndiscovered the data didn\u2019t seem to\nbe entirely accurate. Contrary to the\nreport, young adults weren\u2019t prioritizing\nhealthier options, and seniors seemed\njust as enthusiastic about ice cream as\nthe children. Quickly, we recalibrated\nour use of the market data, deciding its\noutdatedness and possibly idealized self-reported insights were far less relevant\nthan the immediate data on revealed\npreferences.\nLiterature: It is taken for granted that\nanalytics are valuable to any modern\nventure, yet according to Gartner, over 85\npercent of big data analytics projects fail.\nAdditionally, according to a McKinsey\nsurvey, only eight percent of respondent\norganizations were able to successfully\nscale their analytics beyond a specific\nuse case. What, then, accounts for the\nconstant pursuit of data if these projects\nso often fail?\nIn their seminal paper on big data\nanalytics, McAfee and Brynjolfsson\ncompared big data to traditional\nanalytics. They find that firms that\ndescribe themselves as data-driven are,\non average, \u201c5% more productive and 6%\nmore profitable than their competitors\u201d.\nAdditionally, another strength of big\ndata analytics is its real time capabilities\nfrom diverse sources. Thus, it is clear\nthat analytics offer firms a competitive\nadvantage, but how and when to trust\nthem remains a critically understudied\nfocal point.\nAccording to the framework laid out\nby Andriole and Barsky the leading\ncauses of failure in analytics within firms\nare data issues, modeling issues, tools\nissues, talent issues, management issues,\nand cultural issues. Specifically, among\ndata, modeling, and tools problems,\none of the most challenging issues is\nobtaining timely and accurate data. For\nexample, in the simulation, my team\nfaced the issue that while the data might\nhave been accurate at a specific point in\ntime, its validity for making predictions\nwas questionable due to changing\nmarket conditions which rendered past\ntrends less reliable for current decision\nmaking. While analytics are rightly feted\nas a competitive advantage that firms can\nutilize, attention needs to be paid to the\nfactors that render them inaccurate. Both\ntheories support the original insight,\nthat in our case, no data might have been\nbetter than inaccurate data.\nThe two key insights are all\nfundamentally related to one another\nin that they stress the value of context.\nWhile a business plan may collide with\nreality, the literature shows there are\nimportant contexts where it can be\nutilized strategically and analytic data\ncan be extremely helpful, but in the\nwrong context, it can be maladaptive.\nFor a venture to succeed, entrepreneurs\nshould be encouraged to break with strict\nbusiness theory and embrace whatever\nthe context may be.\nSpecial thanks to Professor Dmitry\nSharapov for his engaging class in\nInnovation & Entrepreneurship and for his\nvaluable support on the simulation, which\nserved as the foundation for this article.\nBUSINESS\nClassroom to Curbside: Harvard\u2019s\nFood Truck Challenge\nBusinessWriter\nALIA FRIEDMAN\nAn Imperial Business student\u2019s review on\nbusiness strategy and analytics Ice Cream Truck.

Felix needed something sleeker, sexier, and also\nmuch more maintainable for a tired undergraduate who\nneeds the work experience to pad their CV (I see you for\nwhat you are).\nThankfully, due to the efforts of our recently departed\nwebmaster, Timothy Langer, we have managed exactly\nthat. Timothy has migrated almost 10,000 articles across\nfrom the old website onto the new one and has left our\nsociety in a much better condition than from when he\njoined. I and the rest of the team extend our greatest, and\nmost heartfelt thanks to him \u2013 not just for doing this, but\nalso for the efforts he has exerted in the past year he was\nwith us, in running felixonline.co.uk.\nGraduation\nTo those lucky bastards who have left this miserable,\nsoul-sucking institutions well done! Completing a degree,\nregardless of grade, is tough and something everyone\nshould be proud of. Well done guys, thrive, and flourish.\nBe free in the world, it\u2019s yours for the taking.\nLabour\u2019s PR disaster(s)\nNot even Liz Truss managed to lose so much political\ngoodwill in such a short period of time. Nor did she have\nsuch an impressive mandate to begin with. Labour has\nmanaged to alienate both the old base of broadly left-wing\npeople, Muslims, the LGBTQ+ community, and the new\nbase of businesses, private-school parents, and repentant\nTory voters, with reforms that don\u2019t seek to please anyone\nin particular, nor have any sense of direction. Journalist Ian\nDunt has summed this up quite succinctly: \u201cStarmer has\nno loyal constituency. The hard left hates him, passionate\nRemainers are alienated by make-Brexit-work, the right\nconsiders him the enemy, and populists despise him.\u201d\nLabour\u2019s first 100 days in office have been marked by race\nriots, alleged U-turns on their fiscal policies, corruption\nand sleaze allegations based on the activities of Taylor\nSwift and Labour donor/ peer/ sugar-daddy Lord Waheed\nAlli, and a reset of staff as Morgan McSweeney\u2019s faction in\nWestminster ousts former supremo Sue Gray. Successive\npolls have shown the government slip in the country\u2019s\nestimation, with Saturday 13th\nOctober seeing Labour and\nthe Conservatives neck and neck for voting intention (both\n27%) in a More in Common poll. Starmer himself is the\nmost unpopular Prime Minister in his first 100 days since\nrecords began, according to Pollbase and Ipsos, with an\napproval rating of 26%.

Felix editor Mohammad Majlisi sits\ndown with them to speak about what this\nsecond term in office might mean for students across Imperial\u2019s campuses.\nThis interview has been edited for\nlength and clarity.\nWe start off with a simple question \u2013\nwhat it\u2019s like to return for a second term,\nand how is the experience different.\nCamille starts first: \u201cI think when you\nstart out the first time you spend three\nmonths learning a lot about how not\njust the Union works, but how the College works, who has soft and hard pow-er. Whereas [this time] I could hit the\nground a bit running this time round because I didn\u2019t have to relearn how the organisation works.\u201d What hasn\u2019t changed,\nis relearning the Officer Trustee dynam-ic: \u201ceven though it\u2019s just two people who\nare new in our officer trustee team of five,\nit\u2019s about relearning the whole team dynamic.\u201d\nChristian agrees: \u201cI think the way I always describe it to people is you lose two\nmonths induction; you lose two months\nat the end of your term because you\u2019re\nlike just fading out. So, I think I\u2019ve saved\nfour months from the overlap, so I\u2019ve got\nlike an additional four months to a one-year officer. But I think the team dynamics is really good, but it\u2019s obviously going\nto be different.\u201d\nI asked the Officer Trustees about dealing with a more politically vocal student\nbody, with several campaign and activist\ngroups working around campus. For the\nsabbatical officers, the best approach is\n\u201cactually sitting down with them, giving\nthem that time to talk to us is really, really important,\u201d Christian explains. It\u2019s\nalso reciprocal \u201cgiving us a chance to sort\nof talk them through it, not to dictate\nwhat\u2019s going on, not to say this is what\nhas to happen, but to sort of explain the\ncontext around things. I think historically the Union\u2019s been really poor at that. I\nthink we started doing that last year. It\u2019s\nlike a really big goal is to actually try and\ncommunicate with students.\u201d\nCamille believes in the idea you \u201cneed\nboth campaign groups\u201d and the Union.\n\u201cYou need people demonstrating that volition and then you can mediate behind\nthe scenes\u201d. Last year, Camille found allies in her sustainability goals through\nImperial Climate Action, a pressure\ngroup of students and staff calling for\ngreener policies and divestment from\nfossil fuels at Imperial College.\nAll three returning officers campaigned on building up from their initial manifestos. Camille is focussing on\nincreasing the London PhD stipend, as\nwell as ensuring White City campus development works in the favour of stu-dents. She is also working on cross-de-partment module sharing: \u201cI\u2019m inclined\nto think that would be like more actually\ninterdisciplinary modules between different departments right now,\u201d because\nof complications with Imperial\u2019s status\nas a non-University of London university.\nThe University of London is a federal uni-versity, in which its 17 members, including UCL and LSE, are universities within\ntheir own right, but are also members\nof this conglomerate. Imperial left the\nUniversity of London in 2007, in order to\naward degrees independently.\nSimilarly Christian is focusing on improving access and participation to clubs\nand societies through the student experience fund: \u201cOver the next couple of\nweeks, I\u2019m hoping to release the form for\ndirect applications, which would be open\nto anyone regardless of your status. If you\ndon\u2019t have the fund, it\u2019s open to you.\u201d\nStephanie is continuing her focus on\nsustainability, but with more of a narrow\nfocus: \u201cThere are aspects of the strategy\nand actions that would fall on me or like\nwould relate to me or things I personally\nfeel more passionate about, but I think\noverall as the (sustainability) strategy\ndelivers in its first year what\u2019s most important is being able to transfer that own-ership, which is already happening to our\noperational, full time staff team because\nwe\u2019re not going to be here next year. So,\nlike I think for me most important is that\nI can pass on all these different projects\nand things that we\u2019re working on.\u201d\nChristian and Stephanie are working\non the Principles of Socially Responsible\nEngagement. First introduced in 2023,\nthe current Officer Trustees are aiming\nto revamp the system and improve the\nframework. Up first is a name change.\nThe framework is simply a framework, as\nChristian explains: \u201cIt\u2019s not a strategy. It\u2019s\ngoing to be more sort of guidance based,\nbut it\u2019s also not a policy. What I wanted\nto be really clear from the very start that\nthis is not, \u201cYou do this or else will sanction you.\u201d It\u2019s you do this, and things will\nbe better for you. I want it to be quite\negalitarian. I want buy in \u2013 for students\nto follow and see this framework.\u201d\nIf you would like to read more from\nthe Officer Trustees, check out the interview on felixonline.co.uk.\nCamille Boutrolle, Christian Cooper, Stephanie\nYeung.

Ambros\ndiscovered that microRNAs play an important role in the specialisation of these\ncells by binding to mRNA after the transcription of DNA, halting translation at\nthe ribosome, and therefore preventing\nthe expression of unwanted genes.\nEven though this discovery seemingly\nanswers the question of cell specialisa-tion that puzzled scientists for decades,\nAmbros\u2019s research was originally met\nwith \u201cdeafening silence\u201d, as the Nobel committee stated, since it was believed that microRNAs were unique to\nC. elegans and therefore of little significance in the medical field. That was until\nRuvkun published his discovery of another microRNA that is highly conserved\nacross the animal kingdom, including in\nhuman beings.\nThis breakthrough inspired a boom of\nresearchinthefield,anditisnowthought\nthat the human genome codes for over a\nthousand individual microRNAs, all of\nwhich are involved in the regulation of\ngene expression at the post-transcrip-tional level. Now, over thirty years after\nAmbros\u2019s original discovery, the two scientists have been recognised for this contribution by the Nobel assembly.\nAmbros and Ruvkun\u2019s discovery isn\u2019t\njust useful in solving some of genetics\u2019\nbiggest puzzles; it also has practical applications in medical treatment. It is now\nknown that defects in gene regulation\nby microRNAs can contribute to cancers\nand genetic diseases such as DICER1 syn-drome.\n\u201cMicroRNAs are very much implicated in cancer. There is ongoing research\nto make treatments or utilise microRNAs\u2014mimic microRNA or block microRNA\u2014to treat cancer,\u201d stated Thomas\nPerlmann, secretary-general of the Nobel\nAssembly. However, it\u2019s not all been plain\nsailing: \u201cThere are some technical hur-dles, so there have not been any drugs\nyet.\u201d\nWhatever the future holds for microR-NAs in medical treatment, it is clear that\nAmbros and Ruvkun\u2019s discovery has important implications for how we understand molecular biology and genetics.\nAs Janosch Heller, a professor at Dublin\nCity University, stated, \u201cTheir pioneering\nwork into gene regulation by microR-NAs paved the way for groundbreaking\nresearch into novel therapies for devastating diseases such as epilepsy, but also\nopened our eyes to the wonderful machinery that tightly controls what is happening in our cells.\u201d\nThe tiny molecule that answers a\nbig question\nScienceWriter\nAMELIE BURFORD\nThe discovery of microRNA was finally acknowledged in this year\u2019s Nobel\nPrize in medicine.\nConceptual drawing of microRNA during the gene expression process.

You try to pinpoint the location of the\nsound as you warily turn your head, but there\u2019s nothing to be seen. A few minutes later, it starts again. As you stand up and look at the corner of the living room,\nyou see what must surely be a prop from a Halloween party - a dark, eight-legged\nbeast scampering across your floor at speeds that shouldn\u2019t be possible, the hair on\nits legs contrasting starkly with the plain white of your wall. Not in the UK, you think\n\u2013 this is what Australian nightmares are made of. If you haven\u2019t already screamed\nand run in the other direction and have instead picked up a newspaper (or, worse,\na vacuum cleaner) to send this fearsome beast back to the depths from whence it\narose, wait.\nThis long-legged sprinter is most probably a male giant house spider, Eratigena\nsp. Some of the most frequently encountered spiders in the UK, Eratigena are usually\nthe \u201cscary ones\u201d \u2013 the arachnids that strike terror into the hearts of innocent citizens\nwith their size and speed. However, they are in fact incredibly shy creatures, cowering under the giant primates with whom they inadvertently cross paths. Despite\ntheir common name of \u201chouse spiders,\u201d they are widespread and common in a variety of habitats ranging from gardens to the deepest, darkest woodlands. Females\nare large, with a body length (excluding legs) of a little under 2 cm and a leg-span of\nabout thrice as much. However, they rarely stray from their webs. It\u2019s the males, that\nsuddenly mature in late August every year, that have to find them \u2013 and it\u2019s these\nmales that often end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. The legs of a large\nmale GHS (as they are fondly called by British spider enthusiasts) can span nearly\n8 cm across, and he can run at half a metre per second. Why, then, shouldn\u2019t he be\nfeared?\nPut simply, GHS don\u2019t want to bite. And even if they did, it really wouldn\u2019t cause you\nmuch of an issue. I\u2019ve worked with spiders for over 2 years now, and if there\u2019s one thing\nI can confidently say, it\u2019s that it takes a lot of effort to get a spider to bite you. They don\u2019t\nwant to waste their limited venom stores on something they could easily run away\nfrom. Meaning unless you give them a reason to believe their life is in danger \u2013 for\ninstance, squeezing them against something \u2013 they will always choose flight. Despite\nfrequent sensationalised claims about people being sent to the hospital by a spider,\nthe truth is that there are simply too many things that have to go wrong, and almost\nalways don\u2019t, for this to be the case.\nGHS belong to a group of spiders called Funnel-weavers (family Agelenidae) \u2013 not\nto be confused with the Australian Atracidae which are indeed rather deadly. They\nbuild an elaborate web consisting of a large silk sheet tapering into a funnel-shaped\nentrance within which the spider hides. When an insect stumbles onto the sheet, it\nis swiftly captured, bitten a few times, and dragged back into the spider\u2019s lair to be\neaten. This is a simple and elegant design that has worked in their favour for mil-lennia. Fortunately, their adaptability means that they bring their patented bug-kill-ing tactics along with them when they colonise a little corner of your flat. Being\nlarge spiders, they are capable of tackling all kinds of house pest from flies to cock-roaches, without having to spray any pest-killing concoctions around your house.\nIn addition, despite their fearsome appearance, they are no good in a fight, often\nbeing killed and eaten by considerably smaller species such as cellar spiders, Pholcus\nphalangioides.\nTales of the Unsung Wilderness:\nLonglegs\nEnvironmentWriter\nSHREYAS KUCHIBHOTLA\nAn adult male Eratigena duellica photographed (focus stack) at my flat in West London.

The three species in the atrica group \u2013 Eratigena atrica, duelli-ca, and saeva \u2013 used to belong to the genus Tegenaria before they were shifted to\ntheir current genus, a move which had little rationale besides being a somewhat\nsensible-sounding anagram of the original. Unfortunately, as is often the case with\nspiders, the three species look basically the same. How do you know they are three\nseparate species, then? The most reliable character for telling spider species apart\nis their reproductive organs (the swollen pedipalps in males, and the epigyne in fe-males) which are unique to each species. Sometimes the differences are clear-cut;\nother times, such as in the case of our friend Eratigena, the difference is as subtle as\nthe angle at which a certain feature bends, or the thickness of a projection. In the\ncase of E. duellica, saeva, and atrica, the difference lies in the shape of the tegulum of\nthe palp, and how it merges into the conductor. In E. saeva, the tegulum bends nearly\nat a right angle into a thin conductor, while the bend is a lot smoother in E. duellica\nand the conductor thick and beak-like. Now, things get even wackier \u2013 turns out that\nEratigena duellica is a mostly Eastern species while Eratigena saeva sticks to the west\nof the UK, but there is a considerable region of overlap in the middle where hybridisation occurs, and the palp morphology is somewhere on the broad spectrum from\n\u2018clearly duellica\u2019 to \u2018clearly saeva\u2019. This has prompted questions on whether the two\nspecies are truly distinct. Eratigena atrica, on the other hand, is a rare spider in the\nUK, and despite small populations in Newcastle and Scotland, it is generally imported by accident from mainland Europe.\nGHS are not the only funnel-weavers in the UK. In most of the country, they are\njoined by the smaller and more colourful toothed weaver Textrix denticulata which\nis also often found in and around houses. I was quite pleased to discover a small\ncolony of them on a plant outside my London flat, seeing as they are nowhere near\nas abundant in the Southeast. The hobo spider Eratigena agrestis is found at scattered locations across the country, generally under stones and logs in wasteland\nand grassland; there is a good population of them at Richmond and Bushy Park.\nCoelotes are heavily built, dark spiders that often reside in leaf litter and under logs\nin woodland, while the incredibly rare Eratigena picta has only been found in a\ncouple of old chalk quarries. The true Tegenaria are represented in the UK by quite\na few species, but only three are likely to be encountered. Tegenaria domestica \u2013 the\ncommon house spider \u2013 is similar to GHS but has short, striped legs and a different abdominal pattern; Tegenaria silvestris is found in a variety of natural habitats;\nand the impressive cardinal spider Tegenaria parietina is one of the largest spiders\nin the UK, with a legspan of 12 cm or more. It is the only species that can really be\nmistaken for a GHS, but both sexes have a dustier appearance with faint bands\non the legs and often pale circular marks on the abdomen. While there have been\nrecords of them in houses, the cardinal spider seems to prefer old buildings such\nas churches and museums.\nNow that you know all this (whether you wanted to or not) it is a fair ask on my\npart for you to leave the eight-legged chap in your living room alone. He means\nyou no harm \u2013 he\u2019s just looking for a mate and will be gone before you know it.\nIf his presence bothers you, just pop him in a jar or glass and leave him outside.\nHe will be perfectly fine: his ilk have been living in the cold long before you came\nabout with your centrally heated house. Just look him in the eye(s) and wish him\nluck on his travels.\nThe palps of an adult male Eratigena duellica (left) and Eratigena saeva (right), showing the subtle\ndifference in shape.

Matthew\nis \u201cdecent at art, geography, history,\nand politics.\u201d Mattia\u2019s strengths were\n\u201cChemistry... and usually geography\u201d,\nbut Matthew and Jaime were also quite\nstrong on this for this year\u2019s competition.\nMattia also learnt \u201crandom bits of\nhistory\u201d and poetry. Charlotte was strong\non biology, as well as \u201csome of the more\npop culture stuff like film and TV,\u201d\nshe explained. She was \u201cquite good at\nliterature, but definitely had some spots\u201d\nin her knowledge. Jaime, who wasn\u2019t\npresent, was described as knowledgeable\nabout \u201ceverything.\u201d Charlotte described\nher teammate as knowing about \u201cthe\nstuff you\u2019ve never heard of.\u201d Carlos\nchimes in \u201canything to do with Spain\u201d,\nand \u201cmaths and physics\u201d. Matthew also\ndescribes him as someone who\u2019s \u201cborn in\nthe wrong century.\u201d As a team, literature\nwas their weakness, so they divided up\nthe trivia they needed to learn together.\nDescribing their first match against\nthe University of Manchester, where\nImperial won by an impressive 310-75\npoints, Matthew credits gaining an early\nlead with their team\u2019s victory. \u201cOnce,\nyou\u2019re already ahead, it\u2019s a lot more\nrelaxing, you can sort of enjoy it. You feel\nmore confident, buzzing in when you\nknow you\u2019re not actually taking a risk\nand costing your team by buzzing in with\nthe wrong answer.\u201d He also spoke of their\napproach to the first round: \u201cWe went\ninto it thinking, you know, just don\u2019t get\nbattered in the first round. We went in\nwanting to win the whole thing, but the\nworst thing is to go at the first round and\njust get turned over by another team.\u201d\nMattia expands on this further: \u201cAlso...\nwe don\u2019t want to get destroyed in the first\nround and suddenly look like the weakest\nteam like ever pitched by Imperial in the\nlast, I don\u2019t know, 10 years.\u201d\nManchester was the team to beat. \u201cThe\nonly team who could have caught a lead\nin this competition were Manchester,\u201d\nMatthew explains. It, along with\nMagdalen College, Oxford, have both\nwon four titles each, putting them joint\nsecond to Imperial. \u201cI wonder if they did\nthat deliberately. I think they might have\npaired Manchester and Imperial together\nfor that reason.\u201d\nMattia\u2019s experience last year as\nreserve meant he was quite useful in\nmanaging the pressure of competition.\nHe explained: \u201cObviously it was nice to\nbe reserved last year, and I got to see how\neverything worked, and I got to be in the\nstudios, which meant this year I was far\nless stressed than the others about it.\nLike, I remember before our first episode,\neveryone was kind of shaky and it didn\u2019t\nreally affect me that much.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s mascot is Titus, a plushie\nTitanosaur Jaime sourced from the\nNatural History Museum. Mattia\nexplains their plan for the soft toy: \u201cWe\nwanted to do the same thing as Justin\u2019s\nteam had done with the mascot with like\nLittle Otter the year before, which was,\nadd a new piece of clothing to the mascot\nafter each victory.\u201d\nDue to the teams\u2019 almost concurrent\nsuccesses, the Imperial Dynasty has been\nborn, with previous winners sharing\ntheir knowledge and helping train the\nlatest competitors in the competition.\nThis is Justin\u2019s second year on the\nselection committee. Imperial alum\nand 2022 winner Fatima Sheriff is also\npart of the selection process. She has\nalso continued quizzing on television,\ncompeting on Only Connect on the\nsame day Imperial beat Manchester.\n\u201cThere are four different locations and\ntimes for people to get into the first\nround and for the second round,\u201d Justin\nsays. He has also noted a rise in people\njoining, \u201cI remember having an uptick\nin prospective Singaporeans,\u201d he told\nme, recalling this occurred after 2022,\nafter supremo Max Zheng performed\nastoundingly well. \u201cSome of them tried\nto ask for his autograph,\u201d he continues.\nThe University Challenge team\noperates differently to Quiz Society, with\nits own independent committee and\nselection process, and running its own\nindependent trials. Anyone can attend,\nregardlessofaffiliationwithQuizSociety.\nJustin explained the format: \u201cThere are\ntwo rounds of trials, one of them split\nacross four venues and four dates. There\nare a total of 100 questions for applicants\nto answer and divide it into two columns.\nThere\u2019s the confidence column \u2013 if you\nget it right, you get two points. If you get\nit wrong, you lose a point. There\u2019s a not so\nconfident column you if you get it right,\nyou get one point. If you don\u2019t get it right,\nyou get nothing.\n\u201cSo, we generally select the applicants\nwith the highest answer scores, but if we\nsee someone with some specialty that we\nare interested in or someone that mesh\nwell with some other people skills, we\nwould consider them as well. And so\nthe best dozen or so people will be on\nthe second round of the trial. And then\nwe press buzzers and see who gets the\nanswer first and see how they how they\nfunction as a team and then after that we\nwill spend a week or so selecting a team.\u201d\nMattia explained that experience is\nnot necessary: \u201cPeople can just come\nto their trials without having prepared\nanything. Just come and maybe even the\nknowledge they\u2019ve already accumulated\nintheirlifewillbeenoughtodoincredibly\nwell in the test. They don\u2019t have to psych\nthemselves out and tell themselves it\u2019s\nnot possible because someone like Jaime\non the team, who had never actually done\na quiz before, did the best out of anyone.\u201d\nCurious about running this\nyear?

Students\ncan sign up via the QR code below.\nAnnounced in July 2024, the review seeks to take a \u201ca holistic look at\nwhether our current ways for you to\ncontribute to the Union are effective,\nimpactful and accessible to all Imperial students... it should change some\nof the ways we do things, enabling a\nmore inclusive and representative\nstudents\u2019 union in the future,\u201d from a\nblog post written by Union President\nCamille Boutrolle.\n2024\u2019s leadership election saw a\nvoter turnout of 21.77% for the general election, and a 31.70% turnout\nfor Clubs, Societies and Projects (CSP)\nelections. Whilst this is a greater\nturnout on average for the university\nsector, turnout has decreased in recent years.\nNEWS\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1...\nEditor-in-Chief\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\n\n"

It was not alone: this year\nsaw Hurricane Beryl in July, earlier in the year than any\nother Category 5 Atlantic hurricane. They were accompanied by Hurricane Helene, the deadliest hurricane in\nthe USA since Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005.\nThese hurricanes form a larger trend of a steady increase\nin the frequency of intense storms across the world.\nThere are several reasons why the effects of cyclones\nare getting worse. For instance, the expansion of cities\nin vulnerable cyclone-prone regions puts more people and infrastructure in harm\u2019s way. However, climate\nchange is cited the most when it comes to the severity of\nrecent extreme weather events. The greenhouse effect is\nbelieved to affect tropical cyclones in several ways. The\nIPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report cites research pointing\nout that warmer ocean temperatures lead to higher precipitation in a tropical cyclone, and that rising sea levels\nmake storm surges more likely. However, determining\nwhether climate change has caused a given extreme\nweather event is difficult. The atmosphere is a complicated system, and scientists only have a sample size of\none \u2013 namely the Earth\u2019s \u2013 to study.\nDespite this, a field known as attribution science has\ndeveloped rapidly over the past 20 years. Researchers\nworking in this field aim to answer the question of how\na given extreme weather event was impacted by climate\nchange. To do this they test two models of the Earth\u2019s\nclimate against each other over thousands of simula-tions. One model uses the Earth\u2019s current climate, and\nthe other artificially removes all anthropogenic greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. These simulations,\nrun thousands of times, allow scientists to study the\nchange in likelihood of severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as cyclones. More recent refinements involve the use of multiple different climate\nmodels and simulating the Earth\u2019s climate \u2013 including\nrising emissions \u2013 over a much longer timespan. Climate change does not solely \u201ccause\u201d an event, as it is one\namong many other factors involved. Instead, scientists\nanalyse the intensity of extreme weather events, and\nhow they are affected by global warming.\nOne prominent organisation in this field is World\nWeather Attribution (WWA), which is partnered with\nresearchers at Imperial. The WWA studied Hurricane\nHelene and found that its 3-day maximum rainfall total\nand strong winds were 70% and 150% more likely to occur due to climate change. The increase in wind speeds of\naround 11% which, while not sounding like much, meant\nthat Helene was more than twice as destructive due to\nclimate change. This is due to hurricane damage growing with an eighth-power curve relative to wind speed, as\nestimated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While Milton has not yet been extensively\nstudied, the WWA used existing models to conclude that\nMilton\u2019s rainfall was made twice as likely, and storms of\nsimilar intensity have increased by 40%. It is clear that\ngreenhouse gases have had a significant impact on the\nintensity of the two hurricanes. Frederike Otto, lead of\nthe WWA and lecturer at Imperial\u2019s Grantham Institute,\nsaid, \u201cYet again, our study has shown that hurricanes will\nkeep getting worse if humans keep burning fossil fuels\nand subsequently warming the planet.\u201d\nCurrent research does not imply that the frequency of\ntropical cyclones is on an upwards trend due to climate\nchange but we can expect to see a greater proportion of\nstorms classified as a category 4 or 5. There is also a large\namount of uncertainty regarding events outside western countries, where research is focused.\nApart from climate action, the risk posed by extreme\nweather can be reduced by upgrading emergency infra-structure, promoting safe evacuations and helping poor\nand marginalised communities who are most at risk.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001a\u001c\u0016\u0017\u0015\u0014\u001e\u0013\u001b\u001c\u0012\u0017\u0011\u0010\u000f\u001c\u000e \u000f\u001c \u001a\u0019\u0015\u001e\u001d\u0017\u001c\n\u0011\u0015\u0015\u001e\u0012\u0017\u0013\u000f\u0010\nThe science behind linking correlation to causation\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u001e\u001a\u0019\u001e\u0012\u001e\u0013\u001e\u0011\u001a\u0010\u0016\u000f\u000e\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u001e\u001a \u0016\u0012\u001c \u0013\u001a\n\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001b\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001f\u0016\u0019\u0015\u001f\u0014\u0013\u0012\u001f\u0013\u001c\u0013\u0015\u001b\u001f\u0015\u0014\u0011\u0013\u001b\u001a\u001b\u001f\n\u001a\u0016\u0019\u0019\u0014\u001b\u0019\u0018\u001f\u0010\u000f\u000e\u000f\u0018\u0015\u001c\u0015\u001f\u0016\u0019\u0013\u001f\u000f\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0012\u001f\n\u001a\u000e\u0013\u0016\u0019\u001a\u0010\u0017\u001f\u000f\u0011\u0013\u001b\u001a\u001f\u0011\u0015\u000e\u000e\u001a\u0019\u001b\u001f \u0019 \u0013\u001b\u001a\u001b\u0013\u001a\n\u201c\n\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001b\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001f\u0016\u0019\u0015\u001f\u0014\u0013\u0012\u001f\u0013\u001c\u0013\u0015\u001b\u001f\u0015\u0014\u0011\u0013\u001b\u001a\u001b\u001f\n\u001a\u0016\u0019\u0019\u0014\u001b\u0019\u0018\u001f\u0010\u000f\u000e\u000f\u0018\u0015\u001c\u0015\u001f\u0016\u0019\u0013\u001f\u000f\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0012\u001f\n\u001a\u000e\u0013\u0016\u0019\u001a\u0010\u0017\u001f\u000f\u0011\u0013\u001b\u001a\u001f\u0011\u0015\u000e\u000e\u001a\u0019\u001b\u001f \u0019 \u0013\u001b\u001a\u001b\u0013\u001a\n\u201c\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001e\u0019\u0018\u001e\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001b\u001c\u0017\u0018\u001b\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001f\u001b\u001a\u001e\u001d\u001f\u0019\u0018\u001d\n\n"

Some argue that\nthe costs of policies addressing the\nenvironmentalcrisisaresohighthatthe\ngovernment in power would effectively\ncommit political suicide by enacting\nlaws such as a carbon tax, an emissions\ntrading scheme, or a carbon import\ntariff. People from all backgrounds\nwould feel so threatened by the short-term effects of these policies \u2013 above all\nan increase in the cost of living \u2013 that\nopposition will prove relentless enough\nto force governments to either back out\nfrom the measures or step down.\nTherefore the critiques point to\na command-and-control autocratic\nsystem, that can operate without\ninterruptions on long timeframes, and\nwielding sufficient authority to force\nnecessary policy upon the irrational,\nshortsighted, and fickle masses.\nHowever, although their argument\nis in good part true, they forget that\ndemocracies already make use of such\nan autocratic element without cutting\nback on their liberal values. This\ninstitution is no other than the central\nbank.Itraisesinterestratestofighthigh\ninflation rates, thereby increasing the\ncost of borrowing, hurting businesses\nor common mortgagees, and also\ndisincentivising investment into an\neconomy as private funding is diverted\ntowards savings. All in all, by slowing or\nreversing economic growth, it becomes\nan instigator of unemployment. And\nstill little does one read about people\u2019s\noutrage towards central banks. I argue\ninfavouroftheintroductionofaclimate\ninstitute that operates similarly.\nJust as the central bank\u2019s objective\nis to watch over monetary stability and\nreduce long-term unemployment, the\ntarget of the climate institute would\nbe to introduce \u201ccarrot-and-stick\u201d\nframeworks of measures that set the\neconomy on a sustainable path. Only\nthat could mitigate the negative long-term consequences that hang like the\nsword of Damocles over our society.\nThis institution\u2019s board of seven\ngovernorsistobeelectedbythenational\nparliament with a two-thirds majority\nfor eight years unless it is toppled by\na three-quarters majority before that\ntime. To achieve its objective, it would\nbe given full legislative power over\nspecific aspects of the economy, to\nimplement and oversee measures like a\ncarbon tax or carbon import tariff. The\nconstitutionalityofitslegislationiskept\nin check solely by the constitutional\ncourt, which can also be petitioned\nto inquire about its proceedings by a\nsimple majority in parliament.\nHaving outsourced the dangerous\ntopic of climate change and the blame\nthat comes with it, democracies can\ncontinue to operate. Parliamentarians\nwill silently accept the infringement\non their sovereignty in order to keep\ntheir seat and their say in day-to-day\npolicing.\nGoodbye, votin\u2019!\nA major challenge of a radically\ndifferentnaturemustthenbeconsidered.\nA successful policy of degrowth would\nresult in an unprecedented change\nin the power balance of the world, to\nthe detriment of democracies. Indeed,\nthe world\u2019s largest polluters per capita\n(excluding some Gulf states), also rank at\nthe top of human rights, press freedom,\nand democratic transparency indices.\nDegrowing these economies would\ngreatly reduce their weight in global\ndecision-making, while the autocrats\nand warmongers who tend to have little\nregard for matters of sustainability or\nresponsible governance would benefit\nfrom increased economic power.\nThe correlation between high\nemissions and high peacefulness does\nnot mean that poorer, less democratic\ncountries will liberalise as their status\nconverges with that of the West, as\ndemocratic backsliding has been\nreportedinthelastdecadeindependently\nfrom economic success. China, which\nhas further plunged into autocracy this\ndecade, enjoyed a growth rate of over 5%,\nand Russia\u2019s democratic crackdown and\nunjustified invasion of Ukraine followed\na decade of relatively stable economic\nadvances. On the whole, the global\nlevel of democracy as reported by the\nEconomist Intelligence Unit has dropped\ncontinuously from 2015 to 2021, while\nthe World\u2019s GDP per capita has increased\nby around 16% over the same period.\nFurthermore, the sobriety of a\nshrinking Western economy would\nmake it both practically impossible\nand politically unthinkable for its\ngovernments to pursue military aid\ndeliveries to Ukraine and would do\nlittle to deter China from walking the\ntalk of its expansionist threats. These\ntwo particular situations could be\nshort-lived, but they are certainly only\npreambles to the trouble that lies ahead.\nBeing short on resources and battered by\nan unbridled climate exacerbates violent\ntendencies.\nWhatever awaits us, a bad reputation\nstill clings to the very idea of degrowth,\nand its full integration within the policy\nof any government likely won\u2019t be seen\nsoon. Attacking what researcher Erik\nAssadourian considers to be among\nthe \u201csacred myths of modern culture\u201d\nis often assumed to be another utopian\ndream, brandished only by the hippies\nand tree-huggers most decision-makers\nwould rather pay no attention to. Growth\nremains a key electoral promise of\ncandidates to power.\nAnd yet, European governments\nritually fail to deliver on it: just a month\nago, the Draghi report on productivity in\nthe European Union warned that \u2013 unless\nradical policy changes are enacted \u2013 the\nbloc\u2019s economy would have the same size\nby 2050. Inequalities, on the other hand,\nwill likely do a better job at growing.\nPoliticians beware, unplanned degrowth\nwill be a bitter pill.\nCommentsWriter\nEDGAR SCHAEFF\nHow Parliaments\ncan outsource their\nclimate action\nLittle does one read\nabout people\u2019s\noutrage towards\ncentral banks\n\u201c\n\n"

While the\nmost maths-savvy minds of Imperial\nmight laugh this question away with a\nquick\u201828years\u2019,thereisvalueinanalysing\nthe underlying stakes; our society is built\non the hope that its output can double in\nsizewitheachgeneration.Inotherwords,\nwe accept a promise of endless growth\nat an exponential rate, in a world where\nlimited resources replenish linearly.\nAll of those who are daunted by this\nprospect will be reassured to know\nthat they are not alone: although\nless noticeable in the UK than within\ncontinentalEurope,theglobalmovement\nfor degrowth has recently seen a surge\nin both credibility and impact. While\nits serious proponents in the general\npopulation constitute a marginal niche\nat best, they have always included\ninfluential voices, that of Tim Jackson\n(economist and author of the widely\nacclaimed Prosperity without Growth),\nor public speaker Jean-Marc Jancovici.\nPut simply, degrowth is a policy of\nintentional and controlled decrease in\nan economy\u2019s total production, achieved\nthrough a gradual reduction of its energy\nand material use, to ensure its long-term\nsustainability. In more concrete terms,\nit\u2019s renouncing the superfluous goods\nand services of the modern world so\nthe essentials can always be provided to\npopulations in the future.\nRainbows and butterflies\nI myself was extremely sceptical of\nthe idea, regarding with some disdain\nwhat I considered to be a task too big to\nsucceed in a system too big to fail. That\nwas until stumbled upon an interview of\nMr Jancovici defending his eye-opening\nthesis: degrowth is not a question of if,\nbut when, and most importantly how.\nGrowth is intrinsically linked to the\nconsumption of resources and energy,\nand will inevitably falter when those run\nout. Further miniaturisation, increases\nin efficiency, and circularisation of the\neconomy could only push the doomsday\nback.Andeventhatremainscontentious.\nThe ever-larger cars introduced on\nthe market exemplify the limits of\nthis model: as theorised by the Jevons\nparadox, advances in efficiency are often\noffset by profit incentives, and quickly\ncaught up by our consumerist appetite.\nThe now fashionable argument in\nfavour of so-called \u201cdematerialised\neconomies\u201d is equally misguided. Such\neconomies are only dematerialized at\nthe level of their logistics, as all digital\nservices depend on physical processes,\neither as a means (think Internet servers\nfor Netflix) or an end (think commodities\nfor a hedge fund).\nIt remains tempting to point at the\n30-odd countries that have managed to\ndecouple their emissions and GDP over\nthe last couple of decades, but scientists\nagree that this transition to green\ncapitalism is much too slow to keep the\nEarth on track to net neutrality by 2050.\nTo avoid a return to the unforgiving\nlifestyles of the past, democratic\ndecisions must therefore be made on\nthe fair allocation of the indispensable\n\u201ccarbon credit\u201d, ensuring the basic needs\nof all are covered.\nIt would be unfair to force degrowth\nupon all countries: most economies\naren\u2019t as wasteful and damaging as\nWestern ones. Crucially, the populations\nof the Global South count on growth\nto escape from poverty, just as Western\npopulations did in the last century.\nBy contrast, some scientists suggest\nthat growth has begun to have negative\nconsequences on the welfare of high-income nations, which are now plagued\nby soaring cases of obesity and social\nisolation, while Healthy Life Years are\neither stagnating or falling. This is a\nfirst in human history: the theory holds\nthat growth and ease of living go hand-in-hand. Choosing to reallocate our\ncarbon credit to essential technology\nonly, notably in the field of medicine,\nmight not only reverse those trends but\nalso result in the delocalization of fewer\nemissions to the developing world.\nCOMMENTS\nWhat economic\ndegrowth would\nmean for the future\nof geopolitics\nCommentsEditor\nGUILLAUME FELIX\nThe idea of decreasing the West\u2019s economic output is\nopposed by a range of criticisms, but its implications on\nglobal peace and democracy are rarely considered\n\u201c\nDegrowing\ndemocracies would\ngreatly reduce their\nweight in global\ndecision-making\nBird\u2019s-eye view of the center of Honk Kong Envanto Elements\n\n"

Without them, life could not\nexist. Their complexity is unfathomable,\nprimarily because the amino acid chain,\nknown as the \u2018primary structure\u2019, can engage in various molecular interactions\nwithin the protein. These include interactions within the chain itself (\u2018secondary structure\u2019) and between unique side\nchains branching from different amino\nacids (\u2018tertiary structure\u2019), causing each\nprotein to fold into\nunique shapes.\nWith the\na v e r a g e\np r o t e i n\nlength in\na human\ncell being 430\na m i n o\nacids \u2013 and\nmany exceeding this \u2013 understanding\nhow proteins fold\nand in- teract\nto form shapes\ncritical to their function has challenged scientists\nfor decades, a puzzle termed\nthe \u2018protein folding problem\u2019.\nSolving this problem has\nprofound implications for\nmedicine and drug discovery.\nManydiseasesresultfrommisfoldedproteins, and nearly all modern drugs target\nproteins in some form. Understanding\nprotein structures is thus crucial for understanding and treating diseases.\nHistorically, protein structures were\ndetermined using techniques like X-ray\ncrystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and\nmass spectrometry. This required pro-ducing, isolating, and testing proteins,\nwith a sanguine hope that the data would\nbe sufficient for structure decoding.\nWhile effective for many proteins, this\nmethod failed to solve more complex\nproteins for decades. It is also time-con-suming and expensive due to the practical advanced techniques required.\nHowever, with advances in machine\nlearning and modern technology, scientists thought it might be possible to predict protein structures computationally.\nDavid Baker\u2019s lab believed protein structures could be predicted from amino acid\nsequences. Their work led to the release\nof Rosetta in the 1990s, which was updated significantly\nin 2003, allowing scientists\nto predict protein structures\ncomputation-ally. This also\nopened the\ndoor to designing ideal protein\ns t r u c -tures for specific tasks and reverse-engi-neering the amino acid sequences needed to create them. This led to engineered\nproteins not seen in nature, such as those\ninhibiting the COVID-19 spike protein\nand enzymes that degrade plastics.\nDemis Hassabis, John Jumper, and\ntheir teams at DeepMind aimed to improve upon this using modern machine\nlearning. They created a model trained\non a massive dataset of experimentally determined protein structures. Their\nwork culminated in AlphaFold 2\u2019s release\nin 2020, a significant advancement capable of predicting virtually all known proteins with near-flawless accuracy.\nThe efforts of David Baker, Demis\nHassabis, and John Jumper have effectively solved the protein folding prob-lem; what once took years in the lab can\nnow be determined computationally in\nhours. The impact is already substantial,\nwith Rosetta used to design proteins for\nthe COVID-19 vaccine and AlphaFold 2\ndecoding proteins in bacteria involved in\nantibiotic resistance.\nOnly time will reveal the full scope\nof this Nobel Prize-winning achieve-ment. But one must ask: is this a testament to AI and machine learning\u2019s\nprowess or to the hands that guided it?\nSCIENCE\nUnderstanding the shape of life\nScienceWriter\nJAMES DESMET\nThe 2024 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to David Baker, Demis\nHassabis, and John Jumper for their protein structure breakthroughs.\nBut one must ask: is this a testament\nto AI and machine learning\u2019s prowess\nor to the hands that guided it?\n\u201c\n3D Alpha Fold structure for ZIP7\nUsername: WafflesOnIce (CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\n"

Yet, as\na result of many investments,\nworld-class leadership from\nPep Guardiola and Txiki\nBegiristain, and an elite global\nscouting network, they\u2019ve\nemerged as one of the best-run\nclubs in the world. Amassing\neight Premier League titles,\nsix EFL Cups, two FA Cups, and\nfinally winning the Champions\nLeague in 2023, it is hard to\nargue with this.\nDespite being the only club\nto \u201cfour-peat\u201d the Premier\nLeague, they are possibly the\nmost contentious team to ever\ngrace it. Following a two-year ban and\na \u20ac30 million fine imposed by UEFA for\nFinancial Fair Play (FFP) regulations in\n2020, thePremierLeaguefollowedsuiton\nthe 6thh\nof February, famously charging\nManchester City with 115 breaches of FFP.\nThe organisation alleged that the club\nfailed to provide the accurate financial\ninformation and violated various rules\nrelated to financial reporting over\nmultiple seasons \u2013 spanning between\n2009 to 2018.\nWhat is FFP?\nFinancial Fair Play (FFP) defines a set\nof regulations introduced by UEFA to\npromote financial stability and integrity\nwithin European football. The Premier\nLeague subsequently implemented\nsimilar rules to prevent financial\nmismanagement, protect club heritage\nand fans, improve accountability\nthrough enhanced transparency, and\nmaintain competitiveness.\nThe latter reason doesn\u2019t appear to\nbe holding up well. From the 2017-18\nseason through to the last, Manchester\nCity have won the Premier League all\nbut once, in 2019-2020, thanks to Jurgen\nKlopp\u2019s Liverpool. The Premier League\nclearly wishes to avoid a monopoly, with\nCity as the predator potentially stifling\ncompetition and hindering the growth of\nother clubs.\nWhat are the 115 charges\nplaced on City\u2019s head?\nLeaked emails and a confidential\nPremier League investigation uncovered:\n54 breaches of financial accuracy from\n2009-2018, 14 breaches of player and\nmanager payment accuracy from 2009-2018, seven breaches of the Premier\nLeague\u2019s PSR rules from 2015-2018, five\nbreaches of UEFA\u2019s own FFP rules from\n2013-2018, and 35 failures to cooperate\nwith the PL\u2019s investigations 2018-2023.\nHowever, just in the last week, City\nhave won a legal battle independent of\nthese charges. It concerns commercial\nregulations, specifically APTs. APT rules\nrequire clubs to disclose transactions\nwith associated parties \u2013 those with\nsignificant financial interests \u2013 to ensure\nfair market value and prevent inflated\nsponsorship deals that could disrupt the\nleague\u2019s competitive balance.\nThe Premier League had previously\nblocked two of City\u2019s sponsorship deals,\nboth linked with their ownership in the\nEtihadAviationGroupandtheAbuDhabi\nBank. The tribunal ruled in favour of\nManchester City, stating that the Premier\nLeague\u2019s enforcement of APT rules\nwas procedurally unfair. It concluded\nthat the league unlawfully\nexcluded shareholder loans\nfrom the analysis, violating\nUK competition law and\nabusing its dominant position\nby preventing clubs from\ncommenting on transaction\ndata used to assess market\nvalue.\nSo,aminorbattlewoninthis\n115-wager war. This decision\ncalls into question the overall\nlegitimacy of the league\u2019s\nfinancial regulations and could\nundermine the credibility\nof the broader legal action\nagainst the club. Either way,\nit is guaranteed Manchester\nCity will have as world class a\nboard room as a dressing room.\nLet\u2019s just hope the proceedings are not\nas predictable as: \u201c5\u2019 [minutes].
