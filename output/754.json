    "content": "Opinion. FELIX, Friday November 14th198611 Accommodation Shambles\nTom Melliar-Smith (ICU Welfare Officer), David Lowrle (ICU\nAAO), and Ian Howgate (ICU S RC Rep) express concern over the\nCollege's plans for student residences\nResidence has always been a major problem at IC. Anyone who\nhas had to look for a place to live in\nLondon knows how time\nconsuming it can be. They also\nunderstand what poor quality\naccommodation one can end up in,\noften for quite excessive rents when\ncompared to the rest ofthe country.\nLet us describe to you the present\nsituation along with College's proposals for dealing with it and\nfuture props als, flaws in colleges\nproposals and our suggested\npossible solutions.\nThe Present Situtaion\nThere is annually an overall\nincrease of students, but this\nincrease hides a fall in the\npercentage of home students; the\nnumber of which controls the\namount of money College receives\nfrom the University Grants\nCommittee (UGC) i.e. Government.\nMeanwhile the number of places\nin IC accommodation has fallen,\nwhich this year has resulted in many\nreturning students finding\nthemselves homeless and fresher s being placed in wholly inappropriate accommodation. At the\nsame time many departments have\nfound themselves not necessarily\nshort of space, but short of up to\ndate equipment and facilities for\nundergraduates.\nThe Apparent Proposals By College\nImprove funding by increasing\nhome undergraduate numbers by\n10%\u2014in principle we agree with this\nas tax payers money ought to benefit\nstudents from this country. The\nCollege's solution to the residence\nproblem is to state that there is no\nimmediate problem! They add that\nin the long term a new hall (above\nthe sports centre) would provide 120\n\"expensive\" places to Postgraduates\nand \"some form\" of answer to the\nproblem in approximately five to six\nyears time. Due to the increase in the\nnumber of home UG's. the Rector\nhas already given his opinion that\nthe guarantee of residence to\noverseas P.G.' s should be dropped!\nIn order to circumvent possible\ndepartmental overcrowding,\nCollege have proposed an\nintegrated timetabling of lectures\nthroughout College lecture\ntheatres\u2014which in theory is a sensible idea.\nProblems with the College Proposals\nWe see the necessity of the 10%\nincrease of home UG's, but how, we\nask, are College going to\naccommodate these extra students\nsatisfactorily into the departments\nand into residences?\nCollege's attitude that there is no\nresidence problem is ludicrous.\nCollege must do something now to\nincrease the number of residence\nplaces, that is start setting up more\nHead Tenancy Accommodation.\nTheir long term \"answer\"\u2014the\nnew hall\u2014will cost approximately\nfive to six million pounds and will\ntake around five years to build.\nEven if Student Residence\nCommittee (SRC) managed to get\nan unlikely rate of interest on this six\nmillion of as low as 1.5%, the\nincome from the 120 places created\n(at an estimated \u00a340 per student per\nweek) will just pay the interest, and\nSRC will have a six million pound\ndebt for ever.\nThe short term accommodation\nproblem is yet more acute, as\nCollege have already guaranteed\nplaces in residence for next years\nFresher's, both UG and overseas\nPG's. It therefore seems likely that\nan increased number will have to be\nplaced in accommodation less\nsuited to Freshers,and a even more\nthan in the past may find themselves\nhomeless! Also, it may be of interest\nto note that we shall be loosing 160\nplaces in Hamlet Gardens next year.\nCollege's proposal that overseas\nPG's arriving for the first time in the\ncountry should loose their\nguaranteed place in hall seems\nrather short sighted. Surely this\nwould lead to a smaller number of\nOverseas PG's applying and hence\npossibly to a reduction in revenue.\nThis is approximately \u00a36000 per\nstudent and would result in a vicious\nspiral of diminishing returns.\nThe 10% increase in numbers will\nlead to many timetabling problems.\nLectures may have to be relocated\non a college-wide basis, practicals,\nwhich are tied to specific locations,\nmay become over-crowded and\nequipment which in many cases may\nalready be inadequate will become\nmore so. Obviously an increase in\nstudent numbers will exert a greater\nstress on members of staff and\nreduce staff-student contact.\nNote also that if student numbers\nincrease by 10% IC Union will also\nrequire an equivalent increase in\nfunds to cope with them.\nPossible Solutions\nThe nature of these problems is\nsuch that neither the Union nor\nindividual students can deal with\nthem . We feel that College should\ntake immediate action; firstly\nCollege should appoint someone\nspecific to search for new\naccommodation with the aim of\nacquiring it for student residences.\nSecondly diminished funds should\nbe replenished, in a manner that\ndoes not necessitate such an\nunmanageable increase in student\nnumbers.\nChelsea Cycles\n(Mend-a Bike)\n13-15 Park Walk\nLondon SW10\n01-352 3999\nON IT\nStorage space will be\navailable over the\nChristmas Period to\nthose who require it\nCHELSEA CYCLES\n( MEND A BIKE) \u2022 FROM A TODDLER TO A PROFESSIONAL\n\u2022 NEW & USED CYCLES FULLY GUARANTEED\n\u2022 FULL SPARES & REPAIRS BACK UP\n\u2022 SAME DAY REPAIR SERVICE\n\u2022 CYCLE HIRE AND WHOLESALE\nm STUDENT DISCOUNT\nPark Walk Garage, London SW10\nLiU L FULHAM ROAD\nIT\nCHELSEA CYCLE "

    "content": "Letters\nFELIX, Friday November 14th19862I Come\nTo Bury\nJohn Martin\nDear Sir\nTo quote John Martin \"it would\nappear that silly season is once again\nupon us\" and I would refer you to\nhis article as a prime example of\nwhat he calls \"the ridiculous\".\nThe leaflets distributed outside\nthe Careers Fair only questioned a career in an armaments industry.\nSurely this is just giving the other\nside of the story to the glossy\npictures of fast fighter aircraft, the\nsleek missiles, etc., so far removed\nfrom the horrific effects their use\nhas...I cannot see anyone using the\nCareers Fair \"for political\npurposes\" there. So the distributors\nwere \"grossly arrogant\"? Well,\nJohn Martin says so, and \"he is an\nhonourable man\".\nHe talks of a contrast between\nthese distributors' \"cowardly\npathos\" and the \"heroic people who\nare willing to lay down their lives in\ndefence of freedom\". The leaflets\nwere concerned with the designers\nand constructors of the armaments,\nand as these people are not those\nwho will use the weapons in the\nfield, let alone \"give their lives....\",\none can hardly make a comparison.\nHe finishes with \"we honour the\ndead by making a contribution to\nthe injured and not by deriding their\nsuccessors.\" Is this meant to imply\nthat the distributors of the leaflets\nwere not honouring the dead? Are\nthe \"successors\" to those who fell or\nwere injured in the war the designers\nof today's weapons? Were these\n\"successors\" being derided at all?\nYet, John Martin says they were and\n\"he is an honourable man\".\nThroughout, John Martin plays\non the emotions of the reader with\nthe use of words such as \"heroic\",\n\"lay down their lives\", \"defence of\nfreedom\"\u2014these soldiers, the\nliberators of the concentration\ncamps (note the details he goes into)\nare portrayed as the \"good guys\".\nThat is fine\u2014what sickens me is the\nway that the \"cowardly\" leaflet\ndistributors are contrasted with this\npicture. What sort of impression is\nthis supposed to give? What sort of\ngut reaction? Yet, John Martin does\nthis\u2014and, unlike the cowards, I am\nsure \"he is an honourable man\".\nAre we merely honouring our war\ndead and forgetting the reason\nbehind their death? We may not\nhave armies ready to invade us now,\nbut as we point more and more\nweapons towards \"potential\naggressors\", we have lost the peace,\nthe safer world that these people\ndied for.\nWe many not be at war, but we\nare certainly not at peace.\nDavid Wooding\nPhysics\nMs Representation\nDear Dave\nI read with interest Jonathan\nTurners' rather simple-minded view\nof WIST (FELIX 753), and I take\nconsiderable exception to his\nincluding us in the definition of\nsexism that has been used against\nthe CCU drinking clubs.\nFirstly, may I say, WIST does not\nconstitutionally exclude men and in\nfact we have quite an active male\nmembership. This is no doubt due to\nthe fact that feminism is not a battle\nin which women want to beat down\nand subject men to disadvantages,\nbut a branch of Human Rights\naimed at improving life for all\n(chauvinists excepted). If only more\nmen could put up an effective\nresistance to the demeaning and\nobscene treatment of women in all\nforms of the media\u2014including\ncommon speech, swearwords and\njokes, then we would achieve much\nfaster results.\nPlatform\nPolicy\nDear Dave\nI read with interest the letters\nfrom John Martin and friends in last\nweeks FELIX. There are a couple of\npoints I would like to raise in reply.\nFirstly, GUC did NOT debate, or\nvote upon, the 'No Platform' issue.\nWhat was discussed was the\nprinciple of the government\ninterfering directly with students's unions, and telling them what they\ncan or cannot do in their own\nsphere. In fact there were many\npeople at the meeting who disagreed\nwith the 'No Platform' principle,\nbut who nevertheless voted for the\nright of students's unions to decide\nfor themselves democratically.\nSecondly, I must reply to Mr Martin's comments about\nhomosexuals at Imperial College. It\nHowever, in view of the low level\nof support from men on the one\nhand, and their record of persistent\nand abusive opposition to women's attempts to improve their status on\nthe other, it is not surprising that we\nshould want to meet together\noccasionally in an informal\natmosphere, where we can find relief\nfrom the constricting attitudes that\nexist in this College\nPersonally, I see the C CU drinking clubs as an embodiment of\nthese attitudes and so it is because of\nthe existence of these institutions\nhose only contribution to the image\nof the College as far as I can see is to\npreserve the so-called \"Macho-Culture\" that we need to have a women's group in College.\nThe idea that consuming vast\namounts of alcohol enhances ones'\nmasculinity is a fallacious one\u2014ask\nany women and she will reply that\nyou are a lot less of a man after a night on the be\nFinally, I suggest that Mr. Turner\nforms a \"Persons in Science and\nTechnology\" Group, as he and his\nchauvinistic cronies would no doubt\nidentify admirably with the fitting\nacronym it produces!\nYours,\nJane Bowie\n(President of WIST)\nis quite likely that he has never been\nharrassed about his supposed or\nactual homosexuality; I have. So\nhave many friends and a quaint ances of mine. My comments about\nhomophobia arise from first and\nsecondhand experience and from\nkeeping my eyes and ears open. Mr\nMartin's argument typifies the all\ntoo common attitude: T have not\nexperienced this problem; therefore\nit does not exist.' So you may be\nquite happy developing your\nsexuality on your own\u2014but if the\ngay minority at Imperial wish to\novercome isolation and offer\nsupport in the face of prejudice, who\nare you to stop them? As far as I am\naware, this is not forcing anything\ndown anyone's throat\u2014merely\noffering an opportunity to make life\nat Imperial happier for some\nstudents.\nAnd of course there is a heterosexual society here\u2014it's called Imperial College Union...\nYours,\nChristine Taig\nCollege administration have done a complete U turn on the long-running\nreorganisation of the JCR and the\nmain Sherfield Refectory. The switch\nof the two rooms was first planned\nseveral years ago and the Union\nagreed to a specific set of plans for the\nchangeover, which effectively\ninvolved a simple switch between the\nDining Hall on the ground floor and\nthe JCR on the first. Earlier this week\nUnion sabbatical officers were\npresented with a set of plans for a totally different scheme and it is cle a that the College is now taking a 'We\nshall not be moved stance. The switch\nof facilities is part complete, however,\nand the current JCR now has the QT\nFast Food Bar encroaching\nsignificantly im to the Union's space-the present proposals will reduce\navailable space further still. Whether\nthis change of heart has come about\nsimply because the money is no longe\navailable is hard to say, but it is a sickening example of how College is\ncapable of brushing Union opinion\naside if it so chooses. It was a particularly adept move by admin, to\nentrust College Deputy Secretary\nBrian Lloyd-Davies, the most\npro-Union man in Sherfield, with the\ntask of explaining the College's turnaround to the Union\nrepresentatives.\nFELIX\nI should like to see the written con ten of FELIX expand next term. If you\nhave even vaguely considered\ncontributing to the paper, or if you\nsigned up at Freshers' Fair and since\nfound that you do not have as much\nspare time as you had hoped please\ndrop into the Office anytime and see\nhow FELIX works.

But victory, as\nusual, was won only after many\nheartbeats were lost.\nIC started well. Surrey's attacking\nmovements, though complicated,\nwere efficiently dealt with by the IC\ndefence and the sheer pace of IC's counter-attacks caused all sorts of\nproblems to a somewhat square and\nslow Surrey back four. One of the\ncounter-attacks released Dave\nLynne on the left who crossed to an\nunmarked Nigel Collier, who\nfinished as usual. Philippe Ewart,\nplaying out of position at centre-half, made it 2^0 with a powerful\nnear post header from a corner. IC\nwere now completely over-running\nthe opposition and the Surrey\ndefence did not seem to know what\nto do against such a sharp and pace y front-line as Lynne and Collier were\npresenting. However, five minutes\nbefore half-time, IC's goalkeeper,\nAndy Allen, made his first serious\nmistake of the season and allowed\nSurrey to pull a goal back.\nIC were quick to pull back the\ntwo-goal cushion in the second half\nas Alex (!!!) Lunghi beat the Surrey\noffside trap from a Simon Cole pass\nand netted comfortably. Surrey\nrallied well, however, as their fine\nChinese midfielder, Pak (at least,\nthat is what Surrey were calling\nhim), began to run the game and\nthey scored two goals to equalise\nwith 15 minutes to go. IC piled\nforward as only victory would stand\nthem any chance of qualifying. A goal mouth scramble ended with\nDave Lynne's shot being handled on\nthe line by a Surrey defender: a penalty, with 5 minutes to go, was\nawarded. The pressure was too\nmuch for IC's Captain, who bottled\nout of the responsibility, leaving it\ninstead for Phillippe Ewart, who\ncalmly slotted it in the centre of the\ngoal, past the feet of the already\ncommitted Surrey Keeper.

The only glimmer of a chance fell to Nigel Collier, whose\nshot was expertly tipped away by the\nNew keeper.\nIC's second half performance was\naltogether more convincing. Five\nminutes into the half Alex Lunghi's left-foot volley from 20 yards beat\nflank and a pinpoint cross by Mike\nPlummer left Wendel Charles with\ntime and space to coolly slot the ball\npass the shell-shocked UC keeper.

The University of London Union\nfaces potentially massive financial\ncuts if a proposed change to central\nuniversity funding goes ahead. The\nUGC, the government 'Quango'\nresponsible for university funding, is\nthreatening to cut the budget for the\nuniversity central precinct by 50%.\nThis money normally covers the\ncentral university administration at\nSenate House, the University of\nLondon Libraries, Careers and\nWelfare Services and ULU. It is\nbelieved by the UL U administration\nthat the Senate is unlikely to cut\nitself and hence that the brunt of\ncuts will be born by the Union and\nWelfare Services.\nUL U is currently assessing\nstrategies for opposing cuts and\nalready plans to lobby Senate on\nWednesday 10th December. It is not\nfully clear what the effect of\nsubstantial cuts to UL U would be\nbut it is certain that UL U clubs and\nsocieties would suffer. The UL U building itself has a considerable\nturnover from its bars and services\nand is currently in a healthy state.\nHowever the removal of the\nsubsidy to the Union could put it in\na perilous financial position.\nThe UL U building requires a large staff and capital is needed to\ndevelop it for the future.\nJane Cannon, UL U President, is\nconfident that she can win the\nsupport of the Senate. \" UL U was\nsuccessful in winning the\nUniversity's opposition to the\nintroduction of student loans\" she\nsaid and continued \"I am confident\nwe can be successful in our\ncampaign to prevent cuts in central\nstudent services\". Sir Peter\nSwinerton-Dyer, Chairman of the\nUGC, has been quoted as saying\nthat UL U was the most efficiently\nrun building in the University of\nLondon. It is likely that Sir Peter's comment will be used as strong\nevidence to support ULU.\nThere is concern that cutting\nUL U funding could have severe\nlong term consequences. UL U serves a very large number of\nstudents in the Bloomsbury area\nincluding a serviceable number\nfrom Imperial who live in\nintercollegiate halls. Lesley\nGillingham, IC welfare advisor, said\nthat the importance of Central\nWelfare Services could not be\nunderestimated especially for small\ncolleges, Mr. Gillingham has past\nexperience working for ULU.

On returning from\nplaying football on Saturday\nNovember l st, the student found\nthat a block of material measuring\nabout 5 feet by 3 feet had fallen onto\nhis desk and bed. The debris\nincluded copper piping, plasterboard and brick work; the\nfloorboards and beams were all that\nremained of the ceiling. In addition\na significant amount of water had\nleaked into the room.\nThe room concerned was a new\none which had been converted from\na 'half-landing' in the recent\nrenovation, and was directly below\nthe bathroom. Because of a Holbein\nHouse party on Saturday night\nthere was no other room available in\nthe House, and the student ended up\nstaying with a friend in Southside.\nOn Sunday the room was cleaned\nand since then the student has been\nliving in a Holbein House guest-room. Holbein warden Barry\nSaunders brought the matter to the\nattention of Student Services Officer\nDon Ferguson and enquired about\nthe possibility of a rent rebate for the\nstudent. Mr Ferguson said that the\nmatter would be taken to the\nStudent Residence Committee\n(SRC). He later told FELIX that,\nfrom the evidence presented to him,\nthe disruption caused appeared\n'relatively minor' and as such would\nnot qualify for a rebate if considered\nby the SRC. He stressed that he did\nnot have the power to authorise a rebate, and that the structural\ncondition of Holbein House was the\ndirect responsibility of Peter\nHallworth, the Managing Surveyor\n(Residences).\nA significant insurance claim has\nbeen filed with ICU Hon Sec, Dave\nColley on behalf of the student\nconcerned.\nMore Students\nThe College will be increasing it's intake of students over the next few\nyears in order to comply with the\nUniversity Grants Commission's requirements. Imperial, which has a high staff-student ratio, has been\nasked to increase it's 'home student'\nquota by 10%, and also plans to\nincrease the number of overseas\nstudents by 250. The move is likely\nto result in a shortage in available\nstudent accommodation, particularly with the loss of the 250 places\nfrom Hamlet Gardens next year.\nThe College will be discussing the\npossibility of drop pong the\nguaranteed one year in hall, or\nreplacing it with a guaranteed place\nin College controlled accommodation comprising halls, head\ntenancies and houses.\n\n"

Lots\nof places will have been lost by the\nend of this year due to conversion of\nrooms and the loss of two blocks of\nflats at Hamlet Gardens. The\nnumber of students at the college is\non the increase; 500 more are\nexpected in the long term. This\nmeans that the guarantee of a place\nin hall for undergraduates and\noverseas postgraduates is in\njeopardy. Union Council discussed\nthis fact at some length and decided\nthat we must oppose the loss of the\nguarantee either by insisting that\nnew ac como dati on be found or by\nopposing the increase in student\nnumbers. I shall be hassling every\navailable College person about this.\nAny comments would be welcome.\nTHE JUNIOR COMMON ROOM After the building of the QT\nsnack bar, College's original idea for\nthe Sherfield building was to make\nthe downstairs dining hall into the\nnew JCR, with the current JCR\nbecoming a dining hall.\nThis plan has now been changed\nas apparently the number of\nstudents eating in the Sherfield\nbuilding is so large, the big room\ndownstairs is still needed as a dining\nhall. If the new plans go ahead the\nJCR will be considerably smaller\nthan it was in the past. Anyone who\nwould like to see the College plans\nfor the JCR and dining hall and add\ntheir voice to the discussion, come\nto a meeting with the College\nSurveyor on Monday 17 November\nat 12.30pm in the Union Dining\nHall, first floor of the Union\nBuilding.\nTHE UNION PLANNING GROUP RISES AGAIN The first meeting of the Union\nPlanning Group is on Monday 24th November at 6 pm. in the Union\nBuilding (see next week's FELLX for\nexact details). The idea of this group\nis that ANY ONE with an interest in\nthe long term future of the\nUnion\u2014both its organisation and\nits building\u2014can come along and\ntalk about various ideas, like having\na new sabbatical, opening a new\nfood outlet..etc. You don't have to\nbe a \"hack\" to turn up, in fact the\nmore real students the better.\nFINALLY That's enough from me; enjoy\nRag Week and DO NOT MISS the\namazing Guilds Carnival tonight see you there.\nJasmine Smith's Good\nHousekeeping\nGuide\nGoing to university is for many\npeople the first time they leave\nhome.

How\ndo I manage to produce something\nedible?\" Since this is a subject close\nto everybody's heart, we shall turn\nto it first.

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Friday November 14th19865 Far From The\nMadding Crowd\nAled Williams describes how he spent the\nsummer, after winning a travel award\nBack in January, still sleepy after\na lecture, I was browsing through\nthe notices on the Chemical\nEngineering notice board when the\nInternational Paint 1986 Travel\nAwards poster caught my eye. After\nsome deliberation, I decided to enter\nthe om petition. I obtained an\napplication form, filled it out and\nsent it off. Scarcely would I have\nbelieved that six months later I would be sitting on a plane bound\nfor India. My ten weeks travelling\ntook me over 25,000 miles through\nNorthern India and China. The\nfollowing passages summarise the\njourney which the award enabled\nme to make.\nI stepped off the plane at Delhi\nand clutching my guide book I made\nmy way to the exit. Yellow taxis\nswarmed and cabbies haggled with\ncustomers. A short journey by bus\ntook me to the city centre where,\nafter some difficulty, I managed to\nfind a room in a backstreet hotel for\nabout \u00a32.00 a night. Following a restless night fending off mosquitos,\nI ventured out. In front of the hotel\nran a pothole d road where cattle\nroamed freely amongst the melee of\nmorning traffic. People were\ncooking at the roadside whilst\nothers still slept beneath their\nblankets. Poverty is a lasting\nmemory of India; this was the first\nof many encounters.\nAfter a few days in Delhi, I moved\nnorth 600 miles to Kashmir. The\njourney was intended to last 24\nhours but in the event it took three\ntimes as long due to monsoon\nfloods. The bus described as a \"deluxe video coach\" was of a ramshackle affair. The videos, in\nHindi, ran all night. Kashmir is set\nin the foot hil s of the Himalayas\nwhere the climate is mild, whilst the\nrest of India bakes. At Srinigar I stayed on a plush houseboat which\nhad been built during the time of the\nBritish Raj. The view from the\nverandah was a large lake which\nmirrored the snow capped\nHimalayan mountains. An armada\nof boats laden with exotic goods\nformed a floating market.\nMoving south to Rajastan, the red\nsandstone forts and palaces of Jaipu\nhighlighted the next stop. A steep\nclimb to the turrets of Tiger Fort\nprovided panoramic views over\nJaipur and the surrounding desert.\nThe next leg, from Jaipur to Agra,\nwas by steam train. Wisps of the\nengine's smoke filled the carriage\nand ash settled on seats and clothes.\nAgra is of course the city of the Taj\nMahal. Constructed of white\nmarble and inlaid with semiprecious stone, it is a building of\nbreath-taking beauty. After a brief\nstay at the holy city of Varanassi, to\nsee the bathing in the Ganges, I flew\nfrom Calcutta to Hong Kong via\nBangkok. Hong Kong is an\ninteresting place in its own right, but\nit is also the best place to start a tour\nof China.\nBy ship then from Hong Kong to\nShanghai, where the Yangtze river\npours out into the South China Sea.\nIndustrially the most important city\nin China, it was once known as the\nParis of the East. Indeed, many of\nthe side streets are still reminiscent\nof France. Neon lights, huge\nshopping centres, the hotel jazz\nbands and 5 million bicycles all\ncontributed to give the place an\nunusual character.\nFrom Shanghai to Peking by\ntrain, a distance of a thousand miles.\nPeking is a great city for tourist\nattractions, but itself, unlike\nShanghai, seemed to lack colour.\nAfter visiting the Forbidden City\nand the Summer Palace, I moved\nfrom Peking to Badaling to see the\nGreat Wall. The Great Wall is a magnificent sight, as it winds its way\nup steep hills and over horizons for\nmore than 5,000 miles. As a result of\ntransport difficulties I ended up\nsleeping on the wall. To begin with I slept in one of the many towers, but\nas it was occupied by rats I chose the\nopen air option. There was a clear\nsky that night and at 400 ft. the\ntemperature dropped very quickly,\nbut the view of the sunrise made it\nall worthwhile.\nFrom Badaling to Xian, the end\nof the silk route where the Black\nDeath is still endemic. This is also\nthe place to stop off and see the\nTerra Cotta warriors, a2000 year\nold army of life-size soldiers in battle\nformation. After Xian I moved on\nto Chongqing and took a three day\ncruise along the Yangtze, the world'\nthird longest river, to Wuhan. On\nthe way are beautiful gorges where\n300ft. cliffs rise up from the water.\nFrom Wuhan south to Hong Kong\nby train. A memorable journey 19\nhours sitting on a ruc sac, dodging\nthe expectoration s of the 'Chinese\nPassengers'. Hong Kong was the\nlast stop, regret ably, and with\nlectures looming in a week's time I had to head for London.\nIf you are in your penultimate\nyear at College, then don't make the\nmistake of not entering the 1987\nInternational Paint Travel Awards\nscheme. You could be in distant\nlands sooner than you think.\nUlU travel\nTwice the size \u2014\nTwice the service\nCall into the new ULU Travel\noffice and see how far\nyou can go this winter\nSpecial fares for students\nand academics.\nWorldwide scheduled\nflights on quality airlines.\n' Ski holidays.\n\u2022 Winter breaks around\nEurope.\n\u2022 ISIC cards, ISIS\ninsurance, Group rates.\nWinter Warmers include \u2014 daily\nflights to New York \u00a3 2 2 2 rt n.

    "content": "Clubs FELIX, Friday November 14th198613 Essential\nRugby, 5/11/86:\nIC 1st XV 25, Surrey 1st XV 7\nIC 2nd XV 3, Surrey 2nd XV15\nIC played their fourth and final\nU AU group match against Surrey\nUniversity knowing that it was\nessential to win, and win well, to\nensure a reasonable chance of\nprogressing through to the next\nround. Although handicapped by\ninjury and also by UL U duty for two\nplayers, IC did not disappoint, and\nscored a convincing win over a very\nreasonable Surrey team. IC kicked\noff, and immediately went on the\nattack, press u rising the Surrey fly-half into mis-kicking a touch\nclearance and conceding a line out on their 22-metre line. Then\nfollowed some fine sustained\npressure from the IC pack, which\nresulted in fly-half Mike Anderson\ndriving over in the corner for the\nopening score of the match. Surrey\npulled back to 4-3 with a well-kicked\npenalty, but this was swiftly negated\nby Mike Anderson kicking one over\nto make ICstill four points ahead at\n7-3. The IC line was running very\nwell, and the Surrey defence was\nbecoming more rattled with every\nIC attack. Jimmy Sheik burst\nthrough on the wing from the IC\nline, having been sent away by Mike\nTester, to score IC's second try.\nMike Anderson put over another\npenalty, and then it was the turn of\nthe IC pack. Hooker Andy Martin\ncharged down a clearance by Surrey\nfrom behind their try-line, but the\ntry was disallowed. However,\neighth-man Nige Lee did the\nhonours after the IC pack had\npushed over from the resulting five-yard scrum. Half time went with IC\n18-3 up. The second half saw IC\nplaying into the wind, and they were\nheld back to a certain extent by the\nlong touch-kicks from the Surrey\ndefence. IC worked their way back\nup the field, though, with the backs\nmac king good use of the possession\ngiven them by the pack, and second\nrow Nyall McKay drove through\nthe Surrey fly-half to score. Surrey\ndid not give up though, and\nmanaged to get one in reply, but\nafter Mike Anderson kicked his\nthird penalty, making the score 25-7, the match was sealed.\nPhysical\nOn Saturday 1st November, the\nUniversity of London Korfball\nteam, including 4 players from\nImperial, participated in the first\ntournament of the season in\nBrighton.\nDespite atrocious weather\nconditions, UL won their group\nfairly comfortably recording\nvictories over Sussex University, 2-1, and over two teams from\nBrighton, 1-0 and 5-0.\nThis put them into the final\nagainst the hosts, Brighton\nPolytechnic. In a very physical\nmatch, UL hung on to win 3-2 and\nso successfully defended the title\nthey won last year.\nStricken\nFootball, 8/11/86: IC 2nd XI 2,\nK QC2 nd XI 1\nIC once again had a2nd' s team\nstricken by injury, players nicked by\nthe first team and players going to\nparties in Birmingham. Nevertheless this makeshift side showed\niron character to pull off this result.\nThe game had its usual start for the\n2nd's with the midfield attack\nplaying reasonably well but with the\ndefence looking uncomfortable.\nIndeed it was fortunate that D. Martin the Keeper had had a quiet\nFriday night and was in fine fettle\nfor the afternoon's play. As the first\nhalf wore on IC started to take\ncontrol and this paid off when Bill\nMason combined with Ian Hardy\nwho again found the net for IC.\nKQC hit back quickly though when\na defensive error let in their\nenormous centre forward to score\neasily. That's how it stayed till half-time. Barrow (IC's charismatic\nplayer manager) made a decisive\ntactical change at half-time and IC\nstarted playing with more\nconfidence. Goals were difficult to\ncome by though and it wasn't until\nthe 77th minute when good work\nfrom S. Gordon and W. Buckley let\nin Hardy for his 2nd of the game.\nThen K QC threw everything\nforward and the battling strengths\nof Adams, Barrow, Holland,\nDunthorne and Vandenbegin were\nagain tested, and found to hold true.\nSo the 2nd's went through to the\nquarter finals of the cup, and, oh\nyes, Neill Macdonald was also on\nthe pitch\u2014enough said.\nReal\nAle\nThere was, as promised, more to\ndrink at last week's Real Ale Society\nmeeting, but there were\nconsiderably fewer people to drink\nit and this had interesting\nconsequences.\nFor the next meeting, we are\nhaving a special delivery of four\nbrews from Burton Bridge, a small\nindependant brewery. The OGS\nsuggest that there may be fatal\nconsequence J if you don'tALL turn\nup on FRIDAY 21st November.\n(Extra Day for recovery after I.C.

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday November 14th19864 Icy\nReply\nDear Sir,\nI suggest John Martin goes and\nputs his head in a very large bucket\nof ice-cold water. How can a well-produced, balanced paper such as\nFELIX agree to carry half a page of\nmoronic drivel from someone\nwhose literary appreciation would\nnot appear to extend further than\nthe Sun.\nI fail to understand what is\ngrossly arrogant in distributing\nleaflets at the Careers Fair,\nencouraging people to think of the\nimplications of a career, say, in the\narms industry. Students were free to\ntake them or reject them as they\nwished. Surely to allow companies\nto distribute propaganda material\nunchallenged would have been a gross violation of the student right\nto freedom of thought. British\nNuclear Fuels, for example, issued a brochure showing someone holding\npieces of fuel material in their bare\nhands. ICI produced a brochure\ntelling us how much they cared\nabout the environment. Isn't it\nabout time that Scientists and\nEngineers at Imperial thought a little about the morality, say, of\nworking in South Africa or in\ndesigning weapons? I fail to see what\nis cowardly in not wanting to be\nresponsible for a weapon designed\nto kill a family half way across the\nworld, simply because they\nhappened to be brought up under an\nidea logy not as perfect as our own.\nI can now reveal that, surprise\nsurprise, John Martin has a Barclays Bank account. Could this\nperhaps have affected his\njudgement? The simple truth is that\nBarclays quite openly funds the\nracist regime in South Africa and\nactively participates in the\nexploitation of Namibia against the\nUN charter. No amount of\nconscience money to token blacks\nor statements by Barclays on the evil\nof apartheid can change the fact that\nBarclays has blood on its hands.\nWake up John! There is a war going\non in South Africa which will have a fundamental effect on the whole\nworld. Stop being so bloody naive!\nYoursfaithfully,\nAndy Welter\nChairperson Third World First.\nHouse That\nJack Built\nDear Editor,\nI would like to explain why\nCollege decided to get rid of the\nStudent Residence Committee's gold block.\nAs it happens this is a proposal I put to SRC. The reason for this was\nthat, for at least the last four years\nSRC has been sitting on just over a quarter of a million pounds in the\naim of using it as a deposit for a new\nhall. This amount of money is\ncompletely inadequate, on top of\nwhich all the interest from it goes to\ncollege due to college policy, and the\nresidence committee doesn't see a penny.\nAt the same time the SRC is\npaying 7% interest to college on\nmoney borrowed to buy residences\nin the past. Hence by using a large\npercentage of the gold block to pay\npart of this off, the SRC and hence\nthe students will be earning 7% on\nthe money in real terms.\nIt was agreed that this 7% should\nbe put aside to build up the gold\nblock, and not squandered. At the\nsame time it was said that College\nwould take the fact that we gave\nthem this money into account if a new hall was to be built or bought,\nas ultimately SRC will have to\nborrow the money for this from\ncollege. Hence the student wins in\nevery way.\nYours\nIan Howgate,\n(SRC Rep & Geology Dep. Rep.)\nPlatform\nTickets\nDear David\nWhat is \"Freedom of Speech?\"\nWe have read a lot in FELIX in\nrecent weeks about it, but do we\nhave an absolute right of \"Freedom\nof Speech\"? In this civilised society,\nof course, we don't. The riot acts,\nthe libel laws and the race relation\nlaws restrict what we can say in\npublic and rightly so. Society has\ndecided that, in the interests of\nsociety as a whole , certain views\nshould not be expressed in public.\nA 'no-platform' policy that\ncertain student unions have\nadopted, by democratic vote, is\ntaking the idea slighly further. They\nhave decided that the expression of\ncertain views, be they racist, sexist,\nhomophobic or whatever, has the\neffect of restricting freedom, by\nintimidating already disadvantaged\nand intimidated groups into silence.\nThey have made the decision that\nviews of ethnic minorities, gays and\nwomen, for example, are worth\nhaving more than racists, sexists etc.\nThere is little doubt that the\nexpression of such extreme views\ncan intimidate people, many of\nwhom are feeling scared or worried\nabout speaking anyway and result in\nthe su press ion of views. Hence a no-platform policy, instead of\nrestricting free speech, can be used\nto extend it.\nOf course you have to be very\ncareful about the definition of the\nterms 'racist', or 'sexist', etc. For\nexample the NUS 'no-platform'\npolicy only stops the like of the\nNational Front, the British National\nParty, from having a platform. The\nNUS are well aware of the dangers\nof extending the definitions more\nwidely, which would result in the\npolicy having no credibility at all\nIt is not just a question of freedom\nof speech, but a question of whose\nspeech; the oppressed or the\noppressors.\nYours\nChris Martin\nDOC PG\nOf\nLoans\nAnd\nLetters\nDear Sir,\nIn reply to Colin Trotman's letter\nin last weeks FELIX, I would like to\nmake the following points regarding\nthe Government's proposal for the\nintroduction of student loans.\nHe says the loan would be paid\noff at low interest rates as the\ngraduate's career develops;but why\nshould students be penal is ed for\nentering college by having to pay for\nit themselves.\nThe idea of loans wrongly\nassumes that a student is going to\nautomatically walk into a well paid\njob after graduating and pay off the\nloan, along with the pressures of a mortgage and other financial\ncommitment.\nThe prospect of having to pay off\na massive loan may persuade many\nstudents, especially for 4 or 5 year\ncourses, against going to University\nor Poly. The Government would\nthen think it was justified to close\ndown more departments and\nuniversities.\nMr. Trotman says that a loan\nsystem would \"increase pressure on\nuniversities to develop the right\ncourses for industry and\ncommerce.\" Does this mean that\nsubjects without excellent\nemployment prospects will be\nirrelevant and unnecessary?\nHe admits that the student grant\nhas been reduced to an intolerably\nlow level, but feebly tries to blame\nthis on the N.U.S. Clearly the Government is trying\nto price education out of the reach\nof ordinary people. Education is far\ntoo important for the Government\nto neglect its responsibilities or try\nto make it into another 'self-financing' subject as has happened\nwith many of our social services and\nindustry.\nYours faithfully,\nStephen Blanchard\n( Mech Eng. 2)\nWistful\nThoughts\nDear Dave\nI would like to reply to Jonathan\nTurner's letter in Felix 753. Men at\nthis College (students and staff) are\namazingly sexist. Many of them do\nnot realise the problems faced by\nwomen at this College. For\nexample, some women at this\nCollege take a long time to find close\nfemale friends. This is because the\nyear group/laboratory they work\nwith has so few females. People need\nclose friends of the same sex to\nconfide in.\nThis does not mean that I support\norganisations that restrict their\nmembership to one sex.\nOrganisations like Links, 22 and\nChaps implicitly support the theory\nthat women can't really be\nsuccessful at I.C. They can't join\norganisations for the most sociable\npeople in College; the people who\nhave really run the Union.\nIt is important though that an\norganisation exists to consider\nwomen's issues and bring together\nwomen so that they can make\nfriends. WIST is that organisation.\nMen can and do join WIST if they\nwant. They should, though, support\nthe aims of WIST.\nI find it incredible that some men\nat this College still do not recognise\nthe need for a women's organisation, but I regard it as an\nexample of the sexism of this\nCollege. Men at this College can be\namazingly hypocritical. Staff at IC\nare actively encouraging women to\nstudy here while remaining active\nmembers of tie clubs, the Masons,\netc. I hope that this College will\neventually see sense and ban these\norganisations.\nD. Hugh Southey Chem. Eng. 4\nAnd Now\nFor\nSomething\nCompletely\nDifferent\nDere Di \"Sports Page\" Jones,\nThank U for of e ring your help to\nthose i literate sports club rite rs: as\nsuge s ted last weak in Feelix; It is\ngood to see a Felix editor keen to\nmake the sport page more readable\nto a wide audi ance?

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nHamlet Havoc\nStudents smashed down the door to\nthe 121-130 block of Hamlet Gardens\nwhen they were unable to gain\nentrance to the building last\nThursday. New locks were fitted on\nWednesday in the wake of the rape\nincident on October 19th, but visitors\nwere unable to contact residents in\nHamlet as the entry phones were not\nin working order. A breakdown in\ncommunications meant that Hamlet\nGardens were not informed of the\nplan to install locks. The House\nWarden, Geoff Hungerford, was\nforced to climb in through a window\nwhen he discovered the locks had been\nfitted.\nMr Hungerford later fastened the\nlocks with sticky tape to allow\nvisitors entry, and to allow students\nfrom other blocks access to the\nlaundry. The tape was removed,\nhowever, in spite of Mr Hungerford's attempts to ask the\nstudents not to use the locks.\nThe locks were installed at the\nrequest of the Rector following\ndiscussions with Union President,\nChristine Taig. Student Services\nOfficer Don Ferguson wrote to the\nlandlords requesting that locks be\nfitted at the College's expense to the\n120-130 block, in spite of the lack of\nentry phones. Mr Ferguson later\ntold FELIX that he was not\npersonally in favour of the locks,\nbut had been instructed to write the\nletter.\nThe landlord's representative, Mr\nDavid Fussel, said the locks, which\ncost \u00a3300 to install, were a waste of\nmoney, and that there was no point\nin fitting them before the entry\nphones were working. He pointed\nout, however, that he was anxious to\nhelp the College in it's attempts to\nimprove Hamlet's security, and said\nthat new entry phones were due for\ninstallation within three weeks. The\n\u00a33000 cost of the phones will be met\nby the landlords, Strollmoor.\nQMC Mascotry Team\nRaid Fire Engine\nJezebel, the motorised mascot of\nRCSU, was violated by students\nfrom Queen Mary College last\nSunday. The veteran fire engine was\nsprayed with artificial snow, and the\nbrass bell, worth several hundred\npounds, was stolen. The door of the\nRCS motor club garage had been\nforced open, and Jez had been\nsprayed with the slogan \" QM C'86 free Mary or else.\" The message\nrefers to the QMC mascot, Mary, a leopard, which has been- in the\npossession of the RCS mascot ry team for over three years.\nRCSU Vice President Judith\nHackney contacted QMC Union on\nMonday morning to negotiate the\nreturn of the bell. QM C Union\nofficers were initially unable to trace\nthe raiders.\nOn Wednesday two QM C students called at IC Union Office\nand were given a list of everything\nwhich had been stolen from RCSU\nby the QM C mascot ry team in the\nlast th tee years. The list includes a rotor-arm, a set of RCS rugby shirts,\nBamber the Duck, Fagan the\nRabbit, and Fluffy the Squirrel. In\naddition, QM C are expected to\nreturn a set of wheels from an IC\nUnion van, which were stolen two\nyears ago, as a \"goodwill gesture\".\nMs. Hackney told FELIX that\nthe removal of these items was\ntechnically theft, because none of\nthem are violate mascots of RCSU.\n\"If QM C can't play by mascot ry rules, then there's no point in\nplaying with them\", she said.\nJCR To\nStay\nThe college has decided not to go\nahead with last year's plans to\nre house the Junior Common Room\n(JCR) in the Sherfield Refectory. As\na result the space available in the\nJCR has been drastically reduced\nand the Union will be unable to\nmake full use of its facilities before\nthe QT food outlet closes at 5pm. Originally it was intended that the\nJCR would be swapped with the\nSherfield Refectory and that a central kitchen would be installed to\nprovide food from the Senior\nDining Hall and a smaller student\nrefectory. These plans were rejected\nwhen an unexpected increase in the\nnumber of students using the\nSherfield Refectory was discovered.\nThe college now feels the refectory\nshould not be made smaller in the\nlight of the planned increase in the\nnumber of students over the next\nfew years.\nIC Union are unhappy about the\nmove and will either be pressing for\nthe original plans to be put into\naction or for the college to provide\nappropriate compensation. They\nare particularly concerned that the\nplans to install the QT Snack Bar\nwere agreed to on the basis that the\nJCR would be relocated.\nEngineering\nUnits\nThe Rector, Professor Eric Ash has\nproposed that a system of 'course\nunits' be introduced into the\nEngineering Departments. Speaking at the Engineering Studies\nCommittee on Wednesday, the\nRector pointed out that the system\nwould reduce the high Engineering\nfailure rate and would enable\ninterdepartmental and intercollegiate courses to take place.\nCourse Units are already in use in\nthe Science Departments which\nhave a failure rate of 2% compared\nto a rate of 12% in Engineering.\nUnder the system, courses are\ndivided into 'equal packets of\ninformation' and it is not essential to\npass every unit to gain a degree.\nFree No. 754\n\n"

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Friday November 14th198614 Down & Out Mark 1\nIf you haven't been to the flicks\nlately, for want of some audio visual\nexperience that will do more than\ntransit from one ear hole to the\nother, I don't blame you. Even a cursory glance at most of the large\ncinema billings shows them to be\nsadly lacking. While good cinema is\nstill being produced it is shown on\nfewer occasions, at even fewer\nvenues.\nNor does it do much good for\ncinema when 'quality' productions,\nsuch as the ill fated Revolution, in\nwhich millions have been invested,\nwould have been aided by the simple\npurchase of a tripod for the camera.\nSo, if you find the 'micro-intellects in macro-jets' of Top Gun\na turn off, or Nightmare on Elm\nStreet cinematic ally just that, then\nit's worth scouting around the\nindependent flea pits for a film that's more likely to be worth the cash.\nMany of the films may not be new,\nbut if you missed them first time\nround, you've no excuse to miss\nthem again.\nAmong those winging their way\nacross the screens last week were\nDiva, a superbly tense thriller from\n82, Bloodwedding, a feast of\nSpanish dance and music from 81,\nand Clockwise, last years' offering\nfrom John Cleese, a hectic tale of\nbad time keeping, Fawlty Style. If\nnone of the above strikes a chord\nwith you, then I suggest you stick\nyour head back in the commercial\nmire.\nAfter all this, you've probably\ndecided to forget about the movies\nand stay at home: don't. Get out to\nthe ICA and catch Michael\nNyman's 'The Man who Mistook\nHis Wife For a Hat', electronic\nopera with a difference. Nyman\nr own & o ut in London\nproduced the haunting music for\nChannel 4's 'The Draughtsman's Contract', and his style is both\nstunning and humourous. The piece\ndeals with a disorder known as\nAgnosia in which the codes of\nmemory, vision and language desert\nthe sufferer. If this reminds you of\npost bar night effects, you may well\nclick with 'Hat'.\nOtherwise you can always slap\n'Liverpool', Frankie Goes to\nHollywood's new album on the\nturntable and reflect that however\nhard they may rage, Frankie are\ndestined to be forgotten.\nDavid Burns\nDown & Out Mark 2\nIf the standard Imperial disco\nparty in the Concert Hall/Dining\nHall/JCR is not giving you the kick\nit once did, and you're tired of\nseeing the nameless face of some\nfirst year physicist talking to\nanother nameless face and you've\ndecided that rather than venting\nyour feelings on the Union Exec,\nyou'd take the immensely daring\nand adventurous step of forsaking\nthe Imperial sheep flock; (Groovy\nconditional clause hey?) then the\nLondon Film Festival is a good\nplace to start. It goes on mainly at\nthe National Film Theatre from\nwhom box tickets can be bought\nuntil one and half hours before the\nstart of any film. They can also be\nbought until half an hour before,\nfrom the relevant- location, but it is\nwise to buy well in advance, not only\nbecause you're probably going to\nhave to go to the N FT anyway for a programme; due to the huge\nnumber and variety of films but also\nbecause many of the popular films\nare expected to sell out. The Festival\nlasts until November 30th, and\nalmost all tickets are \u00a33.75, which is\nprobably why it's only a good place\nto start.\nNearer to home there's an\nexhibition of Erich Salomon\nphotographs, for those that way\ninclined, at the Goethe Institute, 50\nPrinces Gate. Salomon was one of\nthe fathers of modern journalistic\nphotography and captured many\nleading figures of the 20's and 30's with a can dour highly unusual at the\ntime. Even if you ^ that way\ninclined, find time to have a look:\nthere's nothing to lose since\nadmission is free, and who knows? It\nmight change your life.\nFor the musically minded, there's the Guitar Weekend 1986. This\ntakes place at the Barbican Centre\n(Barbican Tube) and includes an\nexhibition by guitar makers,\nperformances by leading players\nand a large selection of electrics and\nnon-electric guitars for you to play.\nBetter than staring at priceless\ntreasures in glass cases. (OK, so you\ncan't play a Ming vase....wait a moment I wonder if-well, anyway,\nyou get the drift.)\nAs usual, there's a hundred\nbillion different art exhibitions on\nincluding, no doubt:\"Fingernail\ndrawing techniques by Italian artists\nin the 18th century\" but one which\nmight take the fancy of those\ninterested in the noble subject of the\ninterface of Art with Science is 'Art\nmeets Science' in Shelton St. WC2.\n(Nearest tube Covent Garden.) This\nis an exhibition of the best 'New\nScientist' covers of the last five\nyears. Admission is free and I'd certainly recommend dropping in if\nyou happen to be going to Covent\nGarden. It goes on until the 23rd November.\nAnyway, here are a few things\nwhich I hope whet your appetite, so\nwhy not try one and give that\nphysicist's ugly mug a miss?\nFrancis Miers\nRCSU RAG MAG\nWANTED: More material of a suitable nature (especially\ncartoons), original please.

Unfortunately the man in\nquestion has been planning to do\naway with his wife for some lime...\nThe subplots are both\nimaginative and creatively\nenmeshed but somehow the jokes\nthemselves are not quite funny\nenough, but it is still fairly\nentertaining. The team that bought\nyou \"Airplane\" has also created\nsome very effective parts for Dann\\\nDe Viroand Bette Midler as the rich\nhusband and wife.\nille c ted from the\nstarting on the\nse Tour. David\nWhicker' style\ndic u lou sly dressed,\nwho explores Virgil, Texas, a small-time Ame ' m town, meets its\ninhabitants a..., of course, has\nvarious wacky experiences in the\nprocess.\nThe characters involved are\ntypically eccentric, some possibly\nmore apocryphal and caricatured\nthan others; for example the woman\nwho is so rich that she stays in bed\nall day and the lonely, all-American\nguy who advertises his bachelor-hood on television.\nIf the film has a message (which\nI'm sure it must), it is the stupidity of\nthe Great American Dream and\nhow the characters adapt their\nmundane lifestyles to escape from it.\nThere are flashes of brilliance, but\nthese are unfortunately rather like\nmusic videos and a general\nimpression of disjointed, unfinished\nmediocrity is given. Whether this is\nintentionally designed to emphasize\nthe cynical message, you will have to\ndecide yourselves. All I will say is\nthat the audience applauded more at\nthe beginning than at the end for the\nactual film.\n\"TRUE STORIES\" xxxx\nDavid Byrne of Talking Heads\ndirects a celebration of small town\nAmerica portrayed through .1\ncollection of characters based, in\nstones he read in the newspapers.\nThe film shows an honest man,\ndesperate for a wife, who advertises\non television, the woman who never\ngets out of bed, and others.\n\u2022 The narration contains many\nexamples of David Byrne's dry,\nsurreal \"humour like the occasion\nwhen he is about to make a comment on the difference between\nEuropean and American cities but\nhe forgets it claiming that it is\nwritten down at home somewhere.\nThe whole film is delightful, well\nthought out, acted and photographed and the music, of course, is\nwonderful.\n\"SMOOTH TALK\"xxx\nA young girl discovers the\nrealities of adult life a little too\nrapidly and dramatically one\nafternoon (Need I say more?).\nA cleverly paced and very tense\nbil m with some excellent\nperformances from the young cast.\nREMITIES xx\nExtremities is probably a better\nfilm than the above star rating might\nsuggest but the realism of the\nviolence portrayed makes it a rather\nunpleasant film. I say \"better\" in the\nsense that it conveys emotion\nextremely effectively.\nFarrah Fawcett recreates her\nRage role as the intended victim of\nrape who fights back and torments\nher attacker on the justification,\nprobably true, that because no\nprovable crime has been committed\nthe \"rapist\" would be acquitted in a simple case of her word against his\nAlthough entirely happy about th\nportrayal of a woman who is\nmerely a victim but very cap\nI'm n<^ completely happy with*\nfilm's suggestion of taking the\n|r to your own hands and its call\n.gilan tis m. Strong stuff.\nGONE TO EARTH xx\nThe latest revival of Britain's greatest romantic, Michael Powell\nwhich is hard on the heels of\n\"Colonel Blimp\".\nA country girl's belief in fate leads\nher to marry the local parson, this\nsoon proves to be against her\ndesires, which tend towards the\nsquire.\nOnce again the woman is\npunished for infidelity but with all\nPowell-Pressburger films there is a certain magic which allows some\nforgiveness.\n\u2022BASIL. Tf\nIECTIVE'\nPeter Hammill - 'AND CLOSE AS\nTHIS'.\nVIRGIN RE\nWhen people you admire fall,\nthey do l all very hard. It's not just\nthe pretentious sleeve notes and the\nlyrics that never let up on being\nserious about themselves-we're used\nto that by now. It's just that Peter\nHammilfs ' AND CLOSE AS\nTHIS' is boring. The voice is still\nthere**he trademark of his last 24\nalbums\u2014accompanied by 'one pair\nof hands' \u2014piano and. sparse\nelectronics. So we have Peter\ninn!!- as the prog, rock cabaret\nti st At least Liberace knew when\nto laugh.\nOf the eight tracks on the album,\nfive are self-parodies, as'though\nHammill has^managed to distill his\nsound, and thereby remove all but\n_ the stuff white, \u2022\nIdle class, male teenage angst is\nmade of.

In\nCocteau's unique version man, and\neves Gods, are victims caught up in\nthe cogs and wheels of the infernal\nmachine, fate. He creates a dreamscape which he peoples with\nthese poor trag i comic pawns, each\ntreading the fine line between reality\nand fantasy. In his characters we\nfind the 'types of the boulevard'\nplaced in the forms of the old Greek\nprotagonists but there is enough of\nthe 'poetry of theatre and images' to\nlocate this play far from realism at its stir rca hst roots.\nSimon Callow has assembled an\nex c eu ec: production here, one that\nCocteau tim self might approve of.\nThe x ar veil o us evocation of the\ndream atmosphere flags but briefly\nin the middle. Only then, the dry ice\nhaving dispersed, does toe old\nGedpus surface from the Cocteau\nVMUB although it again submerges\nin \u00bb stunning theatrical cod piece. For powerful style and mes m eric images the production cannot be\nfaulted.\nThe best exponent of the dream\nperson technique is Maggie Smith as\nJocasta. From her flows both\nfarcical humour and drama,\nblending in a vague sense of\ndetachment that allows no pathos.\nLambert Wilson, the French film\nactor, is a perfect Oedipus\u2014entirely\nhandsome, and fallible. His famous\nencounter with the sphinx is perhaps\nthe thematic and stylistic high point\nof the play, deviating as it does from\nthe accepted mythological version..\nHowever this is no play for\nvirtuoso solos. Throughout the cast\nthe actors double up to provide us\nwith accurate, unfortunate\ncharacters each unobtrusive in the\nvision as a whole. Only the\ndandi fie d narrator is left to stand\nout. blessed or burdened with\nknowledge.\nBut what really of the play? A masterpiece or a flawed piece ef\nhig i camp theatre? Have the old\nthirties thoughts grown a little long\nm the tooth or is this revival\nvaluable0 The audacious Cocteau\nlegend still grows and a trip to\nHammersmith would prove\nworthwhile if you are curious.\nMcNeil\n\n"
