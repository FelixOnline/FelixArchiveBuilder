CELEBRATING HIS TBEnTIEDBT BIHTHDAY,\nIn spite of the physical resemblances of the distinguished trio, the President's right hand man is actually much\nyounger than Eisenhower and. Kruschev, -^s recently as 1953 he\nfled, clutching a first, from the ?hy sic3 department to Chem.\nTech., where he studies crystal growth. No man for blinkered\nacademic is m, Kitchener has been rug ger club secretary, cricket\ncapt a ih, secretary of the A.C.C. and secretary of the TTnion;\nand none of these offices will ever be quite the same again.\nShorn of various fictional embellishments, (originated by\nhimself) it must be said that Kitoh's performances as wing\ntli ree quarter and goal-kicker have been something less than\nbrilliant; but none can deny (or explain) his successes at\ncricket. He picked up the rudiments of this game in 1951,\nfrom the great college players of that time, and last season\nmade two tedious centuries among other innings pf lessor\nlen ff thr some, indeed, of ludicrous brevity.\nThose tired of hearing hi:.i on Surrey's cricket ing predominance may usefully recall that he is a native of Essex,\nbut it was at school in Epsom that ICitchener gained his encyclopaedic knowledge of the classics, and the ability to recite\na list of Derby winners, jockeys, owners and tr-d ner s. On\nEpsom golf course, too, he claims to have gone round, in 99-Ave te ren hostel dweller, (fi oom28 lias hod to be reconstructed\nat enormous expense), and former carnival cabaret star, 'The\nGnome' waxes most sociable md eloquent over a jar \u00b0f ale,\nand ii as done so in many places\nfrom the Turk's Head in\nExeter to the Prinsen ICellder\nin Delft. Thus was developed\nthe formidable vehemence of\nspeech which enlivens Council\nmeetings and committees, and\nstirs procrastinating planners\nto speed completion of the \u2022\n\"\nUnion building. As secretary,\nman of sport and international\no on vi via list^ I'd to he ner serves\nthe Union well, while contrib ut in to its gaiety by his\ntaste for bizarre I. ead gear, ancient shoes and impromptu ,\nKarris i \u00bbno ing. Par the reo or d, he is allergic to triumphant\nTfelshme;:, good bowling, the\n-'.nger oat, t lie quiet life and Green Chartreuse, but may\nyet overcome this last anti-path y. During one of the \"tedious\" centuries the writer of this\nprofile o a me into bat with a purposeful air, intent on running\nroe out, but became the laughing stock of the team by being out\nfirst ball. s. \"Kitoh\", unable to face the world, his been' out of the\ncountry this .past week. Si. Bridge Players Move\nMembers of the I.C. Bridge Club first team\nhave survived their bri age playing tour of northern Europe. Their victories are confined to the\nmoral field, but those mathematicians who follow\nthe pools may devote themselves to computing the\nodds on four draws i a seven matches.\nThose who prefer to follow form may consider\nsuch factors as the Leidan Club's craft y provision\nof two bridge teams. One team kept the air ringing\nfor two hours with cries of \" KellnerS Acht Pil sl' and then generously assisted the visitors to the\ntables where more a pper adversaries lay in wait.\nIn view of the excellence of the German\ncigars and beer the team felt inclined to forgive\nCologne for fielding a team which consisted of\none German and three inscrutable orientals from\nPeking.\nThe hospitality extended by Universities from\nBrussels to Gothenberg included a remarkable\ncollection of beverages ranging from near beer to beer, schnapps, snaps and aquavit. In addition the\ndelights of smorgasbord will ever brighten the\nthoughts of the participants as they trudge with\nleaden feet to Mooney's Ptomaine Palace,\nOther continental refinements encountered\nincluded a lady lavatory attendant in Brussels,\nwho solicitously assisted the startled travellers to select the appropriate utensil. In conclusion it can be stated that the\nlength of time this trip will remain in the\nplayer's memories will be equalled only by the\nmemories of the staff of the TEMFERANCE HOTEL, in Copenhagen, who had to assist the belated team\nto their rooms after a night on the town.\nExploration ( Rehearsal )\nThe main section of the rya x^y arrived, in Jj&kei and on\nSunday to be greeted with the fact that two of the group had\nhad bad weather the' previous 3 days.and nights and had to\nretire to lower ground to dry out all their ec pi ip ment, j'e place guys ropes and repair broken tent poles.\nBad weather on Sunday allowed Only two students to make\nthe rendezvous whilst one student pitched his solitary tent on\na site near ca irq? one but to date .has no idea where he was\nthat lonely night*\nFive attempted to make camp one from Langdale but in had\nweather camp was set up at 2000', under the Bowfell 'crags.\nThat night_ every camp suffered under bad conditions,h^ gh gusty\nwinds, a little rain, and the tents enveloped in clouds \u2022\nThe following day at camp one, 5 of the group decided\nshould bad weather continue a retreat to 'lower ground in\nBorrowdale should be made* Two of the group under Bowfell\nmoved down into Langdale straight ways and canned among the\nglacial moraines to link up with 3 more who Iiad come back up\nvalley for more pun is linen te The following morning found the\nremaining three who stayed another night under Bowfell slowly\ncoming down Rossett Gxll, It appeared as if they had overnight\ntaken both their tents and sleeping bag3 for^a swim in /ingle\ntarn*nothing was dry.

The Old Hostel echoed once\nmore to the sound of Dutch voices and \"Sodom eta\nopp'a\"( spelling open to correction).\nThree games were played by Qr on ln gen and three\nby I.e. in the Hockey Festival held over the Easter\nWeekend at the National Physical Laboratories'\nground at Teddlngton. The visitors won one and lost\ntwo, and we won two and lost one. A special match\nwas arranged on Easter Sunday between I.C. and\nfl ronin gen which I.C. won undeservedly by 2 goals to\n1. The Dutch style of hockey is considerably more\ndelicate than ours, being modelled on the Indian\nrather than the English type of game. However, the\nsides were evenly matched, and a really enjoyable\ngame resulted.\nFrom the first day, when three Dutchmen d is appeared in pursuit of three obviously well informed Swedish damsels, to the fa he well party held on\ntheir last night in England, considerable interest\nwas shown in matters other than those pertaining\nto hookey. Soho in general, and the Club Tabu in particular were frequented. Some amusement was\ncaused by an article in a Sunday newspaper, well\nknown for its uncovering of vice in the West-End,\ndealing with a midnight \"Orgy of Jazz\" at which\nseveral of the \"Nederlandern\" were present.\nUndoubtedly, the most memorable part of the\nVisit was the previously mentioned faf ie well party\nIn t ne Old Hostel. The Warden was Informed well in advance, and he abandoned ship several days before\nthe revels began. Liquor, food and nurses were imported in quantity to cater for all tastes. Beer\nflowed freely, mainly over the floor of the capt-ain's room which served as the bar. After two hours\nsleep on Wednesday morning, thirteen tired but happy\nDutchmen returned to their native heath with pleasant if somewhat hazy recollections of tho lr stay a tI.C. GREAT GAME GOLF \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nLast weekend a group of I.C. golfers left their cares behind them for the annual outing to Cooden\nBeach. The more fortunate ones travelled by train while the remainder of the party w hq had left in a covered Jeep arrived in an open Jeep, having had\nas light argument involving a ditch and a hedge on\nthe way. f to lf was taken seriously on the Saturday,\na Medal Competition being won by K.B. Walker. In\nthe evening entertainment was provided by T. Mc.\nVelgh on guitar and various people on piano.\nThe aol fl ng Association's President, a local resident, was accompanied home by several members\nand, after a little liquid refreshment, a short\ncut was taken for the return trip. This involved\nseveral fields, ditches and barbed wire fences so\nthat most people were ready for bed on return to the Dormy House. A. Kitchener, however, was reported to have been seen wandering about some hours\nlater clutching a pint pot of bear.\naol f didn't appear to suffer too much, for a. Park-ln son returned forty points in a Stableford comp-et it ion on the Sunday morning and was almost caught\nin the afternoon by D \u00abButters with 39 points.\nThe return trip' was made after tea, the missing\nparts of the Jeep being retrieved from the ditch and secured with rope. Alltogether a most success-full nesting which one ;hopes will be repeated many\ntimes.\nIn the spring Meeting on March 2\u00abnd, at Wentworth\nthe President's Prize was won by M.(J. Hampton and\nthe Glover Cup by K.B. Walker. Exceptionally bad\nweather was responsible for many high scope*.\nThe eve of this combined R.C.S. and C.4a. tour was marked by sensation, the dilatory D.M. Thomas losing all the tickets, Whilst searchers\npadded about the Union in pyjamas and macintoshes,\nthe booming voice of Thomas reassured everyone that\nit probable didn't realty matter and, indeed, this same voice succeeded in persuading dubious Dutch\nof i lola Jt s that ail was well.\nEarly on the day or departure all were awakened\nby alarm clocks: all that is esc ep tB. Hearn, inside\nwhose head a ringing noise breaks out whatever time\nhe wishes tx> get up, thus making t ne use of an alarm\nunnecessary. The team enjoyed a perfect crossing,\nwhich was marred only by an unexpected closing of\nthe bar by the captain, who It was rumoured, feared\nfor the safety of the ship.\nThe first match was R.C.S. versus Amsterdam, and\nit attracted a reasonable crowd, who no doubt anti.\nc ipa ted an exhibition of t ne finer points of the ga^ie\nby the brilliant British exponents, Although the team\ntook some time to settle down, they eventually\nProduced some very good passing movements and won\n17-11.\nThe following day the Guilds met\nWeuve, the Shell Oil Company team,\nwhich con stats mainly of Englishmen, a, some of them old students of I.C. The match was close throughout, and\nGuilds'were unlucky to lose 8-6. At\none stage B. Hearn, despite a multi-pli city of muscular and ligament, ry defects, forced himself across t ne Shell line, but unluckily dropped\nthe ball without grounding it prop-e rly. The large crowd was very appreciative of the excellent play.a. id the Shell team\nentertained us royally after the game. Those who\nremember K.F. Patrick will be shocked to hear he\ndrunk as a lord.\nThe next two days were spent in works visits. One of these was to a brewery, and t ne second to a liqueur works .where the famous Dutch 'Genever' is made. No details are available. The tour finished with matches against the\nUniversity of Delft, whom Guilds beat 31-0 and\nR.C.S.230. Both games were played in a very\nfriendly spirit, and Guilds and R.C.S. both demonstrated the arts of passing, catching, kicking,\nand running straight very well.\nNeedless to add, the Dutch hospitality was\nmagnificent, occasionally continuing to 5 a.m. Many stories have been related, and will be related\nin the bar: to print them here would be to rob\nthem of their flavour.\nThank you, D.S. R.F.C. for a memorable visit. HOU-ANb EASTER 'Sfe\nt atm* bj OW FEUX BOARD, InpwW CoHm Umm. London, S.W.7. MMtf bf S'U. VOUX \u00bbLAIT WL, jets, MajkoM Fin. London, W.14. "

    "content": "4 FELIX VIEWPOINT of K.B. DESHPANDE\nThe talk en \"Military Planning and Jtomia Weapons*\ngiven recently in our College by Prof. KLaokett was very\nstimulating. I consider that the following.points are very\nimportant far us to think about.\n1. The over a row au ig of the hall indicated that the\nstudents -were eager to know the views of the Professor on\nthis important to pio in relation to the prospects of war\nand peace.\n2. The whole idea Behind military planning and consequent military pacts organised by the western Powers seems\nto be based on the assumption that the Soviet Union is the\na roh enemy and is going to attack them at any time, and so\nthey should be prepared for instantaneous retaliation or\neven preventative war.\n3. There is a very powerful section of Westerners who\nthink that at t mic weapons should be used far tactical\npurposes\n4> There is a general feeling that in any future world\nwar atomic weapons will be used and will lead to extermination of the human race.\n5. There is less likelihood of another world war; if i toome s, Westerners imagine that, it would be only with the\nSoviet Union.\n6. In the advent of war, the fate of the British people\nwould be the gloomiest because two or three H bombs will be sufficient to destroy all life on this tiny and den sly populated island.\n7. The technological superiority of the West in atomic\nweapons and their carriers no longer exists and hence the\ntone of talks for disarmament is now milder and mare\nconciliator;' than it was some years ago. Hence there is now\nmore possibility of some agreement on disarmament.\n8. In answer to the question: what can ordinary people\ndo to ensure peace? The Professor explained that the whole\naim. of his talk was to stimulate thought on this and\nrelated problems, and to induce men and women to act in their own interests.\n9. The last point which struck me was whether talks\nlike these would increase the complacency among people to\nallow their rulers to continue the production of weapons\nof mass destruction as deterrents or for tactical weapons\nand to spend a huge amount of public money, or would it disillusion the people and cause them to persuade their\nrulers to spend the money on improving the standard of\nliving, in particular in underdeveloped countries.\nThese are important issues which require close\nconsideration, particularly by those concerned with science\nand te oh nc logy.

As the guest at the Studen's union, he and\nrepresentatives from other European Universities were ssh ov n. the sights of student life in Berlin; the highlights being a visit to a power station, brewery and a gin factory.\nThe Free University in Berlin is of interest. Students\nof the Eastern sector, after having suffered much aS the\nhands of the Russians, moved to west Berlin where they have\nnow established their own University. This University is run\nby the studs n to body to the extent of appointing ther' lecturers\nand Professors.\nThe visit was one of good will, the Technical University\nbeing interested in establishing a friendly relationship\nwith I. C.f hey have- offered a scholarship for an I.C. student to study for a year at their university, starting\nNovember next. The student will receive the generous sum of\n250 D. Majdcs per month and will be provided with ac como dati on in their Hostel (holds only 30 people). It is hoped that T.C. will be able to reciprocate in a similar' manner.\nAnother outcome of the visit was the suggestion that I \u00bbC and German students should exchange hospitality during the\nsummer vacations, and there is the possibility that tours\nto Batlia at reduced rates may be organised. Students interested should o on tact the I.C Union office. The 1.0. Sports\ntes ms will also be welcome visitors.\n( Budget< Z$ iri he s< Z$i u denis The Chancellor struck a sorry blow for th t well being of\nstudents in the budget. We are not interested jn Premium Bonds\nbecause after great eo ono my more is spent im a week than earned,\nthe remainder being taken from National Savings.\nWe are, however, very interested in the laws concerning\nfood and drink, and are distressed to find that the potent-fluid called Berrydown\u00bb a type of Cider, had now bean included\nwith Wines as a source of revenue to the exchequer. The price\nrises by 42/\u00ab from 8/6 a flagon to 12/-.\nThis drink has for some time been in favour as a. cheap\nsubstitute far gin, and has been used er tr Wi veil y on unsuspecting ladies requesting cider. Tt has a disturbing effect on\nthe equilibrium ,'which is not noticed until the wi at ira attempts\nta reach a vertical position. Thus maidens' fall completely into the hands (or arms) of the male and are at the latter's mercy - a dastardly trick.\nA young Bedford lady, i rho, after a. party at which\nlarge quantities of this drink were on hand, fled to rush back to her abode before closing time.
