They had an excellent time\nand asked me to express their\ngratitude for a very memorable\ntour. The Union were great by\nsupplying breakfasts and accommodation, the Aero Dept supplied an excellent tour of the\ndepartment, and the members of\nC&G RFC all helped out with\nan excellent turnout on\nSaturday.

Maybe nobody\ncares any more... We groan about\nhow it's not surprising we're apathetic when our degrees take up\nmore time than a full time job,\nand how, even if we did have the\ntime to go out and get excited\nabout things, we couldn't afford\nit because of grant cuts...

    "content": "simon baker\nThe first job this week is to congratulate the four\nlucky blok es that won the Sabbatical elections.\nOf course, since this is being written at 4:50am on Tuesday morning (you don't think I sleep, do\nyou?), I have no idea who triumphed and dare\nnot predict the result. Mind you, you don't have\nto be Mystic Meg to forecast the turnout being\nmuch lower than last year, thanks to the crazy\nrules on the new Union Card. I know that we\nreally ought to have one by now, but surely it\nwould be possible, by allowing voting only in\none's department, to permit the use of swipe\ncards as well. Since voters are checked off against\nthe College lists anyway, the need to punch cards\nseems superfluous. If die turnout was usually\nspectacular it would be different, but as things\nare, the votes may well be able to be counted on\nthe fingers of a pair of mittens.\nAlthough clearly the most important,\nImperial is not the only place to have gone to the\npolls recently. The Australians have just voted\nout the Labour party after thirteen years - not an\nevent that would usually set my pulse racing. But\nwith the party goes Paul Keating, the only product of Oz worse than The Flying Doctors. This\nrepulsive little man's sole preoccupation for the\nlast five years has been the advancement of his\ndisdain for the monarchy, an issue that is much\nmore finely balanced than Mr Keating would like\nus to believe. The arguments that he has presented are weaker than a cup of tea from the\nGlaxo common room (chemists' in-joke, I'm afraid), with no attempt to define the structure\nthat he wishes to replace it with, such as the\npower of a president and the means of election.\nThe net result is to raise more questions than he\nseeks to answer. For this reason, and for the fact\nthat his attention to domestic matters has consequently suffered, the Australian people have had\nenough. With a new man in charge, I'm sure Her\nMajesty can now visit without fear of some yo b putting his arm around her.\nLast week, I saw in the Evening Standard\nthat the Government plans to cut Imperial's budget by \u00a32million.[ It was reported on the front page of Felix on December 13th, Simon] This is\nclearly not good news. It is unfortunate that the\nwell-intention ed policy of expanding higher education has been a victim of its own success,\nresulting in cuts in funding for well-established\ncentres of excellence such as this, at a time when\nthe new University of Uncolnshire is under con-struct ion. As I have said before, the aim should\nbe to have equality of opportunity, irrespective of\nbackground, not to allow anybody with virtually\nno A levels to get a degree. Other forms of higher education need to be expanded to accommodate such cases, otherwise such funding cuts are\nthe inevitable consequence.\nThat said, on the day that I saw this news, I also saw some signposts being attached to one of\nthe lamp posts by Queen's lawn, indicating\nwhere the buildings are. I am truly grateful. No\nmore wandering around the icy wastelands of\nSW7 searching in vain for my lectures. I saw\nthese signs and wondered how I ever managed\nbefore. These are, of course, in addition to the\ncountless thousands elsewhere around the campus that tell us where Sherfield is (I wonder\nwhen we'll get signs to Sheffield) and draw our\nattention to days that don't exist, such as\nWednesday 1st March. The irony of such cuts\nand expenditure is pam fully clear and makes you\nfeel a little less sympathetic in the face of such\nprofligate spending.\nFinally, I expect that there are few of you\nwho haven't seen the new Pizza Hut advert, featuring Murray Walker and Damon Hill. It is by\nfar the best thing on TTV at the moment, save for\nCracker, and is the funniest commercial for\nyears. One of me all time favourites of all time,\nmate. Not 'arf.\nRCS UNION ELECTIONS\nVOTE!( Even for the hell of it!)\nVoting: Monday 11, Tuesday 12 RESULTS U GM in the bar\nLunchtimes in all Departments during the ELECTION BARNLGHT\n/CU Card required Tuesday 12 March at 7:30pm "

    "content": "TWO . FELIX FRIDAY MARCH 8TH1996 NEWS\nInternational Night verdict: 'brilliant'\nPHOTO: IVAN CHAN Fourteen different nations were represented in the show.\nBY ROBIN RILEY\nLast Friday's Overseas Committee's International night was\nattended by over 700 staff, students and their families.\nThe evening began in the\nusual manner as guests were\ngiven the chance to taste the traditional foods of the countries\nrepresented. The carefully packaged Singaporean delicacies\nquickly disappeared, while the\nlarge-scale operation of the\nIndian society catered for a long\nand fast-moving queue. For a short time it seemed that the\nfood fair might be a little too successful: serving from the Italian\nstall had to be curtailed in order\nto persuade the appreciative\naudience to leave the dining hall\nand take their seats for the con-cert.\nThe fast-paced show that\nfollowed consisted of a presentation from students from fourteen\ndifferent nations, cleverly interlaced with slide shows and com-ment ary. The audience filling the\nGreat Hall was treated to a dazzling array of costumes, music\nand dancing. The show's highlights included fashion shows,\nclashing dragons, and an entrancing belly dance by a member of\nthe Lebanese society.\nParticularly well-received\nwas the hilarious short play from\nthe Indian Society about the\nignorance of a cockney lad of\nAsian descent concerning his\ngrandparents' homeland. The\nAfro-Caribbean society's dynamic and politically aware but joyful\ncelebration of the history and\nculture of the African people was\nalso rapturous ly received.\nThe night finished with a huge party, with live music and a disco occupying the Senior and\nJunior Common Rooms.\nUnaffected by restrictive licensing laws, all those present danced\nand drank well into the small\nhours, long after the Union stewards had pushed the last few diehards from Beit Quad.\nInterviewed shortly afterwards G. Tan, the OSC's Honourary Junior Treasurer, said\n\"I think it went pretty well...\nthere were no real problems. A few more mistakes were made\nlast year.\" Other students congratulated the OS C on organising\nthe night, arguably now established as Imperial's principle\nsocial event of the year. ICU President Sarah White said \"I thought it was bloody brilliant.\"\nNews in brief\nKidnapped!\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nSarah White, Imperial College\nUnion president, went missing\nfrom her office on Tuesday\nnight, apparently appr opiate d by\nmedical students as a Rag stunt.\nBefore being 'abducted' a parting message was left on\nSarah's answering machine:\n\"Hello, it's Sarah, I 've been kid-napped. Can you cancel my\nmeetings today?\" It is believed\nthat students from St Mary's are\nresponsible, though there have\nbeen allegations that the Deputy\nPresident, Tim Townend, may\nhave assisted them.\nReports have reached Felix\nsuggesting that the medics, on\nthe last day of St Mary's Rag\nWeek, attempted to kidnap the\nthe Union president of Charing\nCross and Westminster Medical\nSchool. The potential presidential thieves were foiled when\nPolice intervention prevented\nthe students getting near CX W's Union. Denied their usual quarry\nthe students raided ICU instead.\nAs Felix went to press, St Mary's Rag were unavailable for com-ment. Sarah did not reappear in\nthe ICU offices until Wednesday\nnight.\n\"They strung me up like\nthis\" she said, demonstrating a cross-like posture, \"I was there\nfor six hours... they had to feed\nme themselves.\" The medics\napparently plaster-cast her arms\nand shoulders, and wouldn't let\nher go to the toilet.\nA bemused but unharmed\nMiss White was later seen in Da\nVinci's recovering from her\nordeal. Still smiling, Sarah complained that nobody had gone to\nlook for her, and that the ransom\ndemand for her had been refused\nby the Union office. The other\nsabbaticals didn't seem too put\nout by her sudden disappearance,\none remarking philo s phi call y that\n\"they could keep her.\"\nWith the regard to her meet-in gs, one member of college staff\ntold Felix that he had merely\nbeen informed by ICU that\nSarah had been off sick.\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nUniversity challenge?\nThe next round of IC's bid to\nwin University Challenge will be\nscreened next Wednesday. The\ngroup from Imperial steamed\nthrough to the second round of\nthe television quiz after beating\nSt Andrews University in the\nfirst round.\nThe team, consisting of Jim\nTotty, Nick Bradshaw, Chris\nHarrison and captain Mark\nPallen, face Lancaster University\nin the show to be transmitted on\nMarch 13th on BBC 2.\nCharity funds 'not for\nequipment'\nThe Association of Medical\nResearch Charities has expressed\nconcern that they are increasingly being asked to pay for major\npieces of equipment. They say\nthey will not pay for university\ninfrastructure, insisting that such\nfunding remains the resp on sibi l ty of the National Health Service.\nSome smaller charities have\nexpr e sed fears that they might\nbe compelled to pay for basic\nequipment, offices, computers,\ninsurance and rent if they want\nto establish a unit in a university\nin the future.\nIn the past, larger research\ncharities have helped where they\ncould with flexible long term\nsupport and funds for new initiatives and buildings. There is evidence that they have been asked\nto meet more of the costs in the\npast five years.\nUnlucky for some\nA report commissioned by an\naudience awareness group in\nAmerica into the nature of movie\n'baddies' has revealed that scientists are twice as likely as any\nother professional group to be\nkilled in Hollywood films.\nThe research shows that it\ndoesn't matter whether or not\nthe high-forehead ed b off in is\nplotting to overthrow the world,\nor just collaborating to save it,\nthe scientist is always the first to\nget it in the neck in the flicks.\n\n"

    "content": "Forget Prozac, We're' The Generation'! In Britain we spend \u00a33 billion a year on the single most\ncraved food - chocolate. Why? Research suggests it is\na mood enhancing drug and bingeing may be a self-medication. Sharminee Kumaradevan reports.\nIn1728 the famous Swedish I Carolus Linnaeus christened the cocoa tree\nTheobroma caco a, meaning \"food ol the\ngods\"; today chocolate is seen more as a secret indulgence. Introduced to London in the\nmid-17th century, chocolate was seen as the height\nof decadence, costing the equivalent of \u00a3500 per lb.\nSo a cup ol chocolate could be enjoyed only by the\nvery rich.\nToday, chocolate is seen as a near-universal treat\nand according to recent research by Professor j David Warbuton at Reading I Jniversity, chocolate is\na mood-enhancing drug that increases our ie eling s.H^'''' of well-being; indeed eating chocolate may be a healthy response to stress and depression.\nCilOCOJiltfc can be a thankless task. The melting point ol chocolate needs to be above room tem-per a ture, but below the temperature inside the\nmouth. The chocolate should form crystals hard\nenough to hold it together but not so hard it's impossible to take a bite. And the crystals should lie\nsmall. Otherwise the chocolate tastes gritty and\nlooks bumpy instead of smooth and glossy.\nfc mMog \u00a9 \u00a9md fo \u00a9\u00a9\u00a9tat!\u00a3\nMM PK1' tJ ii a Ml WffiH, says Warbuton. I le is a member ol the Associates ol Research into the\nScience ol Enjoyment (ARISE); an organisation\ncommitted to studying the positive contribution ol\ncommon everyday pleasures, like chocolate. ARISE\nrecently surveyed 529b people in 16 countries to\nmonitor people's chocolate eating habits in the\nwork place. Apparently not only do women eat 1\nmore chocolate than men (on average twice as\nmuch) but they also find it more calming and relax-ing. Many women report an increase in their craving lor chocolate just before a[le rio d. Sweet says\nthis is because many women feel low in energy then\nand need to boost their sugar levels.\nYma c ii ub fe coi xj tud diet fed to! in the same way as nicotine in cigarettes according to Corine Sweet, a counsellor\nwith the Eating Disorders Association. \"It is a mood-altering substance. People get hooked on the\nchemicals in chocolate and the trash energy, that\nrush of blood sugar.\" But in so-called addicts the\npleasure is short-lived and is usually followed by\nfeelings of guilt. Warbuton argues the guilt may be\ndoing the most harm. \"Guilt creates stress hor-m ones, which mobil is e fatty acids such ^\nas cholesterol which can clog the arte rw^ m ies and lead to a heart attack.\" ^m. JL\nG3k\u00aeQolliltt<e lies in its chemistry. It has over\n300 different chemicals, which give chocolate its\ndistinctive flavour and texture. Some of these\nchemicals are mood altering drugs. As Professor\nWarbuton points out, \"More than 50 per cent of\npeople who eat four squares of chocolate feel in\na better mood for it afterwards\" This is thought\nto be because chocolate contains:-Galaxy\n...a chemical closely related\nto amphetamines, which\nraise blood pressure and\nblood glucose levels, making\nus feel more alert and giving us a sense of well-being. We produce it in our bodies naturally,\nespecially during times of stress and anxiety. It is\npossible that bingeing on chocolate balances our\nmood controlling chemicals after an emotionally\nupsetting situation.\nand t^\"h'<>' \u00ab i,^...... a chemical similar to\ncaffeine which is responsible for the stimulating\neffects of chocolate.\nAnother quality that makes chocolate irresistible\nis its \"melt in the mouth\" sensation. Cocoa butter melts just below body\ntemperature. So when\nchocolate melts it actually\ncools down the mouth as it\nabsorbs energy in the form\nof heat.\nThe particle size of chocolate is another reason\nit feels so good when we eat it and is very important in imparting that rich, creamy texture.\nWhen chocolate is made, the liquid mixture is\ncrunched through heavy-duty rollers until the\nsugar and carbohydrate particles are reduced to\nmicroscopic size. On the\ncontinent they are fussier\nthan in Britain about particle size: the smaller the bet-ter. This is because the\ns maE er the particles, the better the emulsion\n(liquid with tiny solid parts suspended in it).\nSmaller particles give a thicker emu l sion, making the chocolate linger in\nthe mouth longer and providing a stronger after-taste. British chocolate\nflows more quickly round the mouth\nso we taste it quicker - but unfortunately the flavour goes sooner.\n\n"

I'd say\nit was just weird - very weird indeed.\nThe opening scenes portray the first\nGerman bombing raid over Belgrade in 1941\nwhen Ivan, a guard at the zoo, witnesses the\ndestruction of many of his beloved animals.\nFortunately he manages to save a few, and takes\nthem to join other refugees in his grandfather's basement.\nIvan's brother Marco takes control of this\nl aiding place, and turns it into an arms factory.\nAfter the war ends, he manages to keep everyone working in the basement for him by pretending that the fighting is still going on.\nTwenty years later, during a wedding party\nwhen everyone gets very drunk, Marco's 'prison-ers' finally learn the til th. His friend Petra\nPoppara 'Blacky'(l) offers fi im a gun to shoot\nhimself, but instead he shoots his legs three\ntimes as a 'symbolic suicide'.\nThe film drags on for almost three hours, as\nthe main characters die one by one. Blacky is the\nlast to die, before everyone is reunited in death\non the banks of the River Danube.\nUnderground is supposed to be 'a blend of\ndrama and comedy', but looks more like an\nimprovised play in which all the characters are\non drugs! Yet for some reason, it managed to win\nthe Palme d 'Or for best film at Cannes last year.\nPerhaps I completely missed the point, but\nI didn't enjoy it at all, and after a while I didn't even bother to read the very annoying sub ti ties. The rest of the audience seemed to share my\nlack of enthusiasm, and during some parts there\nappeared to be more action in the theatre than\non the screen, as people got up and walked out.\nI can safely say that this is the worst film I have ever seen, or am ever likely to see. I would-n't recommend it to anyone - it's just far too\nstrange.\ntheatre: the ends of the\nearths The blurb in the National's pamphlet is\nenough to put anyone off: \"Set in the troubled Balkans of 1990, David is asked to\ngive up smoking\". 'Fields of Ambrosia',\nhere we come, I thought. However, it has\nlong been my opinion\nthat the blok e who wrote\nthe blurb; 1) never sees\nthe plays, 2) hears the\nstoryline third-hand and\n3) would get hold of the\nwrong end of the stick\neven if the other end was\nclearly labelled 'hold this\nend', so I ignored it.\nThe play unfolds in\nthe round of the intimate\nCottlesloe Theatre, on an\nuncomfortably pebbly stage. It opens with\na meeting between level-headed Cathy\n(Samantha Bond) and her nervous breakdown of a husband Daniel (Michael\nSheen). She has flown out to him, leaving\ntheir critically-ill baby at home, after being\ntold of his deteriorating mental state.\nNot only is Daniel extremely adept at\nrunning away from emotional stress, but\nhe is constantly searching for\nwhich will give his life meaning.\nanything\nSo while\nCathy waits with plane tickets home,\nDaniel has snuck off to find a 'wise old\nman' in the hills.\nUnfortunately, all he finds is a disguised robber who leaves him with only his\nshoes and trousers. Still none the wiser, he\nmeets a world-weary local whose only\n| 3 BB j f*|r*\"\" advice is \"give up s mok \u2022 SBS K.. \u2022 \". ing\". Daniel does this\nwith a passion, and takes\nthe improvement in his\ndaughter's health as a sign of its power.\nAll this is set against escalating violence in the\nregion, culminating in\nDaniel being taken\nhostage and returning to\ncigarettes.\nI really enjoyed this play.\nThe acting was superb and it wasn't the\ndepressing \"insight into the human need\nfor direction\" which the pamphlet\npromised. I would definitely recommend\nit, but if you have the \u00a36.50 spare for tickets there are still better things to see at the\nNational. My advice would be to wait until\nit comes out on video, and go to see Judi\nDench instead, before she finishes.\n\n"

Unfortunatelv,\nthere is very little coverage of his\nown influence on Daguerre or\nConstable, for example. Indeed,\nthe monochromatic prints (mostly\nsepia) resemble unusually early\npostcards, and just as Daguerre\nused to fill his prints with colour,\nTurner put touches of gouache on\nhis prints in a similar style.\nThe show offers a clear, nontechnical description of the process\nof printing, through etching, mez-zo tint, aqua tint and printing. The\namount of work involved is so large\nthat Turner only completed 71 of\nthe intended 100 prints and in\n1819, twelve years after starting,\nthe project was abandoned.\nHowever, the works were clear and\ndidactic, each print making its own\nstatement and each a genuine study\nof light and form. The result made\nhis name and his fortune.\nThough the show is quite small\n(only two rooms), it gives a clear\npicture of the liber Studiorum,\nthanks to the presentation of various stages in the printing process.\nOne can see how a picture evolved\nfrom a simple representation to\nalmost an allegory of the subject.\nThis is not a window into the past,\nbut more a question of rhetoric.\nThis academic style of art is ideally\nsuited to honing technique.

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 8TH MARCH 1 9 9 6 . FIVE\nUniversity students ere\non the whole os to ble and resilient lot, but very\nfew of them are likely to\nspend the whole of their\nstudent days floating on\na sea of calm tranquillity.\nThings go wrong some-times.\nThe kind of things that go\nwrong are as varied as human life\nitself Students are in no way\nimmune to the contingencies of\nillness, broken relationships,\nloneliness and major disturbances. Nor, of course, are they\nimmune from worries about\nmoney, accommodation or a multitude of other\nsuch mundane things.\nSome problems,\nthrown up by students\nare specifically linked to the academic situation - examination\nanxiety, the too close identification of academic performance\nwith personal validity and worries about the effectiveness and\nadequacy of study habits are\ncommon examples. These are\nnot problems experienced by\nshop-workers, bus drivers or\nbricklayers. Generally speaking,\nhowever, students problems do\nnot in themselves mark them off\nfrom their contemporaries outside the university. What is special about the student is the\ndegree of impact which such\nproblems can have upon work\nactivity. Academic work, with its\nin-built time limitations, is by\ncommon consent becoming\nincreasingly intense, and\ndemands a sustained high level of\nintellectual efficiency. It is peculiarly susceptible to the destructive impact of anxiety and dis-tress, whatever the source. In\nthis special sense therefore, stu-dents' problems are always\nurgent.\nThe cringing ly awful spate\nof British Telecom commercials\ndo have the merit of espousing\nwhat I believe to be an important\ntruth. It seems to me that when\nthings go wrong the first thing to\ndo is to talk about it. In one sense\nit doesn't really matter who you\ntalk to, provided that you're listened to. The chance acquaintance in a pub or at a party might\ndo, or more likely a personal\nfriend. People frequently under-estimate, and are subsequently\nsurprised by, the real relief\nwhich flows from sharing\none's distress or\nservices can be of use; the Health\nCentre with its wade range ol\nresources, the Chaplaincy and\nthe Union Adviser amongst\nthem.\nThe student counsellor is in\na slightly different (some would\nsay privileged) position, in that\nhe is employed to do nothing but\ntalk to students, for this reason\ncounsellors see far fewer students than doctors for example,\nand for the same reason a counsellor's role is much less under-stood. This is especially true in a College of science and technology where a lot of students - and\nan endorsement of our views.\nWe don't really welcome insightful comment, analysis of motive,\nor any other honest reaction,\nunless it happens to line up with\nideas about ourselves that we\nhave a strong wish not to disturb.\nSuch an aversion to the disturbance of our preconceptions is\nnormal in everyday life. The\npoint is that at times of crisis it\nmay be important to look below\nthe surface of what is going on. It\nis this component of honesty\nwhich gives counselling its 'cut-ting edge', which can sometimes\nmake it a slightly disconcerting\nexperience, though\nalways, I worry with It's good to to lb Do nfl dling on Stu dont Co uns oll or another person.\nIn the nature of things some\nstudents may turn as a matter of\ncourse to their parents, and\nindeed where a problem appears\nto have long-term implications,\nmost students will not feel at\nease until they have taken the\nfamily into their confidence.\nSometimes however these\ninformal sources of support may\nnot be available or sufficient, in\nwhich case it may be sensible to\napproach people in college who\nhave an institutional responsibility for helping students. The most\nobvious person is the personal\ntutor, or the departmental senior\ntutor. For Post graduates, try the\nsupervisor or the Departmental\nPost-graduate tutor. There are\nalso two College Tutors; Dr\nMargaret Goodgame and Dr\nGareth Jones. Hall and house\nwardens are another group of\npeople who are easily approachable - and who would readily\naccept a first-line responsibility\nfor discussing personal problems.\nFor reasons which may or\nmay not be valid, students may\nfeel reticent about taking their\ndifficulties to teaching staff. It\nmay then be that other support\nwould hope, a supportive\nsome of their teachers too - tend\nto see human behaviour in rather\nmechanistic terms. This way of\nlooking at things almost always\nleads to over-simplification of\ncomplex situations because it\nignores the fundamental fact that\nwe live in a world of feeling.\nWhat dominates our lives, motivates us, stimulates us, depresses\nus and sustains us are feelings\nabout ourselves and about other\npeople. When things go wrong\nfor people, in any other than the\nmost trivial matters, the opportunity of expressing feelings and\nof having those feelings acknowledged by someone else becomes\nimportant.\nCounselling as a technical\nactivity then, is profoundly concerned with the s alien ce of feel-in gs, of the emotional infrastructure of human life. It is also profoundly concerned with honesty,\nand it is this, perhaps more than\nanything else, which distinguishes a counselling relationship from\nother relationships. Counselling\nis nearly always friendly, but it\nisn't friendship. When we talk to\nour friends or our relatives we\nare often seeking the comfort of\nCounselling then is concerned with feelings and with\nhonesty. It is also concerned\nwith confidentiality. Discussions\nin my office are private, and I am\nnot free to talk to tutors, supervisors or indeed anyone else\nabout a student, unless the student explicitly and fully agrees to\nit. One implication of this is that\nfrom time to time I have to\naccept that students will choose\nto act in ways which would seem\nto me to be unwise or even\npotentially disastrous. My job is\nnot 'solving peoples' problems' -it is helping people to solve their\nown. In reality the sources of\nanxiety and distress may well be\nthings which cannot be changed,\nand the task of the individual\nmay therefore be that of making\na better shot at adapting to the\ndifficulties, and thereby min-imi sing the damage they may\ncause.\nIf there are things you would\nlike to talk about I would be very\nglad to see you, and I am easy to\ncontact by phone on Internal\n49430 or by calling at my office\nat 15 Prince's Gardens.\n\n"

Whether you are\nexploited or not, it all depends on your perce p tion, and to call yourself such is indicative of a victim complex. Usually this is the root of the problem with those who have a bent towards paranoia\ntheories. In fact, the lyrics are littered with them\n- particularly the polarisation of the \"Us vs.\nThem\" situation. However this is necessary as\nrhetoric and can be quite tangible. Though nothing is written on their press release about them-selves, perhaps most of their angry reactionary\ntirade against \"Them\" is situation is t, although it\ncould be, as mentioned, just a collective neurosis.\nThe industrial guitar onslaught is of the unrelenting and repetitive sort. This is no bad thing.\nSerious numbers of brain cells were lost by this\nscribe in head banging heaven. The only problem\narises from the guitar solos. Some may argue that\nthey are the highlight; in certain circumstances\nthey are, but surely it's all about context.\nIn essence The Exploited sound like\nMegadeth, but without the latter's penchant for\nexotic rhythms and other-worldly scales. So, a more apt description would be a more punk\napproach to metal. (5)\ngig: ash+scheer+\nplacebo+a.c. acoustics\u2122\nAC. Acoustics opened the show witnessed by\nonly a handful of people which was a shame.\nTheir set was tight, and almost every song was\ninterwoven with slow, passionate guitar rifts that\nmade the songs sounded majestic and mystical.\nThey were the best band to play that night.\nScheer were like Powder minus a track like\nAfrodysiac'. They played with speed and intensity but unfortunately little else. The vocals bordered on screams for most tracks and they are\nlikely to appeal to those who like heavy guitar rifts\n(what else?) and nothing else. Pass please.\nPlacebo opened with their current single and\nplayed with impressive intensity for a three piece.\nThey were miles ahead of Scheer and their heart\npumping rifts got the crowd warmed up.\nUnfortunately the vocals were awful. Most bands\ntry to play harder to compensate for the obvious\nlack of sensitivity in their vocals. That's what\nPlacebo did. They will probably be doomed to\nplaying fast tracks like the majority of indie bands\nunless they work harder on their vocals.\nAsh finally came on. The number of young\ngirls here was a welcome sight compared to what\nwe get at good old Imperial. It was obvious before\nthey even st mm med a chord that they could be\ncomplete toss and still get a standing ovation.\nUnfortunately that was what happened.\nWhat makes Ash different is their a doles cent, wise cracking humour that they bring into\ntheir songs. Can anyone imagine Oasis or Blur\ndoing 'Girl From Mars' ? They sing with a kind of\nsensitivity and innocence that puts a smile on your\nface. Tonight, though, they were very disappoint-ing.

FELIX FRIDAY MARCH 8TH1996 SPORT\nFelix Sport French Revenge\nFor Waterloo\nMamma\nMia!\nC&G RFC 0 - 48 ENSICA\nThe morning of the match\nlooked promising as too many\nGuilds players turned up (a first\nin Guilds history), and our\nFrench Euro-cousins were looking decidedly hung over.\nHowever, it soon became\nclear that the Frenchies had a secret weapon. They could play\nrugby1. From the start our pack was\na little shaky, and their backs\nshowed the type of flair that the\nFrench are famous for.\nHowever, the tackling dis-Winner\nTakes It All\nIC came a respectable fifth\nin the British University Pistol\nChampionship at Bisley last\nweekend.\nDespite dod gy triggers, guns\nfalling apart, targets that moved\nand the freezing temperature;\nIC proved that they could still\nget admirable scores close\nbehind the leaders.\nplay of the backs, particularly\nStevie W, Alex and Tom\n'Loverboy' Salter, made sure that\nthe Ensica players left feeling\nvery bruised.\nIn the forwards, Fritz von\nEsser kept his end up in the\nunaccustomed position of second\nrow, and James Weekes ensured\nthat we won at least some of the\nline-out ball after Toby had to go\noff injured.\nAll in all, a good laugh, and\nthe third half in the bar afterwards showed the Frenchies\nwhat rugby should be about.\nSo Long\nVIRGINS 40 - 7 WYE\nDespite windy conditions, the\nbacks displayed quick and accurate handling, allowing Penny to\nscore twice and Sian to claim a hat-trick on her return from\ninjury.\nWye's forwards were simply\nno match for their IC counterparts and IC dominated all set\npieces. Jane, Adele and Lynsey\neach put points on the board.\nWye scored a late push over try.\nICWAFC II 4 - 0 RHUL II\nWith only seven players, it did-n't look good for IC as the game\ncommenced against division\nleaders RH UL. In the first half IC played a storming game [yawn1, we always\nhave storming games \u2014Editor],\nThe defence was solid, the midfield athletic, and the lone striker accurate.\nThis resulted in Juliette\nscoring a hat trick of superb\ngoals [are there ever any other\nkind? \u2014 Editor], followed by a beautiful tap in by Eleanor.\nThe second half wasn't as\nproductive but the team kept\nit's form keeping the score to\nfour nil.\nHockey Is\nThe Name\nOf The\nGame\nRSM 1 0 - 0 SOAS\nA good finish to a storming season resulted in the Royal School\nof Mines Hockey Club being\npromoted, and next year they\nwill compete in the same league\nas IC II's.

College maintenance\nstaff have been working all week\nto stop the flow of water dripping through the office roof.\nSecurity have temporarily\nrelocated their Southside officers into the postal distribution\ncentre on the ground floor of\nSouthside. The lodge itself has\nbeen staffed with an army of\nbuckets strategically placed to\ncatch the drips.\nSecurity staff have complained about IC Estates' handling of the problem, which they\ninsist has been growing steadily\nworse for the past three weeks.\nThe source of the flood has not\nbeen confirmed, but it is\nthought to be from leaking waste\npipes from the flat directly\nabove the lodge. The office is\nexpected to be up and running\nagain by today.\n'Ballot fatigue' blamed for\nR CSU election problems\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nThe Royal College of Science\nUnion election hustings had to be\ncancelled last Thursday, having\nbeen derailed by various administrative problems. The event was\npostponed when it became clear\nthat the returning officer did not\nhave the nomination papers\nwhich indicate which candidates\nare standing.\nSpeaking to Felix, Ken\nPritchard, R CSU vice-president,\nsaid that the event had been\nrescheduled for Tuesday. The\nreturning officer and R CSU Honorary Secretary, HelenLouise Windsor, was keen to\nstress that the situation was now\nin hand: \"I have all the papers\nnow,\" she said.\nThere have also been problems with papers being removed\nand defaced. Some comments\nscrawled on the papers revealed\nstudents' doubts as to the worth\nof the poll. One candidate's nomination was adorned with a graffito commenting \"What have they\ndone for the RCSU? Vote New\nElection,\" prompting some\nobservers to comment that students might be suffering from\n'ballot fatigue.'\nBogus candidates had also\nbeen entered for some posts,\nalong with names of people who\nhad been entered by others without their consent. It is not known\nwho was responsible for these\nlatter infringements of election\nrules. Helen-Louise said that she\nforesaw no further problems,\ndrawing comparisons to the City\nand Guilds elections, where it is\nalleged that some candidates'\nsecond ers manned ballot boxes.\nThere has been concern\nfrom some quarters about the\nsuitability of some of the can di dates, who had reportedly signed\nup without researching the posts\nor what they entailed. Mr Pritchard commented that\n\"enthusiasm was more important\nthan experience,\" though he did\nconcede that they \"could never\nexpect a huge turnout... [stu-dents] either don't know the can-di dates, or they don't care.\"\nRCSU's publicity officer, Rob\nPark, said that it could become\ndifficult to find people to do certain jobs, such as the position of\ntreasurer, due to their time-con-sum ing nature and the expertise\nrequired.\nVoting is due to take place in\nthe five science departments on\nMonday and Tuesday of next\nweek.

The results were\nannounced in Da Vinci's Bar on\nTuesday night amid laments\nabout the low turnout at South\nKensington, with St. Mary's representing some 30% of the votes\ncast. Others described the event\nas 'anti-climatic', in view of the\namount of interest shown both in\nthe bar and at the ballot boxes.\nThe final results were: Eric\nAllsop (President), Piers\nWilliams (Deputy President for\nFinance and and Services), Sarah\nCorneille (Deputy President for\nClubs and Societies) and Alex\nFeakes (Felix editor and Print\nUnit Manager).\nThe influence of Mary's has\ncaused some debate, given that\nabout 60% of the medical school\nturned out, compared with only\n8% of their South Kensington\ncounterparts. It has been speculated that the outcome would\nhave been little different had\nmore South Kensington students\nPHOTO: IVAN CHAN Victorious candidates celebrate: (1 to r) Eric, Sarah, Alex and Piers.\nvoted. Oily Newman, of the ICU elections committee, went so far\nas to say that \"those Mary's votes\ndidn't make a difference at all.\"\nTim Townend, the current DP(C& S) drew comparisons with\ncampus universities such as\nAston and Hull, which have comparable turnouts. He felt the low\nshowing at the polls was not\n\"much cause for concern\". Last\nyear saw some 1209 votes cast,\nwhich was down on the previous\nyear's of 1670. This year's was\nless than 900.\nThe closest vote turned out\nto be Alex's, due to the traditional 'block vote' employed by\nSt. Mary's Students. Though\nmore than 200 voted for new\nelection, 64 rebelled by voting\nfor him. His overall winning margin was only 61 votes, out of a total of 859 votes cast. Their\nfeelings were reflected by the relatively hard time he was given at\nthe St.Mary's Hustings last week,\nwhere it was alleged that his\nreporting style had damaged the\ncause of SM HMS SU in the\nforthcoming BMS merger.\nEric Allsop was voted in far\nmore decisively, receiving more\nthan 60% of the votes cast, thus\nbeating Luke Morales and Mark\nContinued on page three\nThe student newspaper of\nImperial College\nIssue 1053\nMarch 8th1996 Green Light\nfor BMS\nBY TIM ST.CLAIR\nKensington & Chelsea Borough\nPlanning Council finally granted\nplanning permission for the\nBasic Medical Sciences building\nproject this week, after numerous delays.

Peshay's mix of Ruby's 'Salt Water Fish' is intelligent jungle at its best,\nthere's some excellent, funky, future jazz in the\nform of T Power & M.K. Ultra's 'Mutant Jazz',\nand The Black Dog are on form as usual. DJ.\nFood's 'Peace' also definitely deserves a listen and\nfull marks go to Spooky for their industrial dance\ntrack, 'Clank'.\nThe second disc again begins in the mainstream with, surprisingly enough, Massive\nAttack's 'Kama Coma' and Bomb The Bass'\n'One To One Religion' being easily the least accessible tracks. But, there is a sharp improvement.\n'Nights Introlude' by Nightmares On Wax\nensures that I 'll be buying their album 'Smoker's Delight', while D* Note's 'Garden Of Earthly\nDelights' is, quite simply, lush!\nValue for money? Well, there's twenty-six\ntracks, of which at least twenty are blindingly\ngood. The second c.d. loses marks for the first\ncouple of tracks and isn't put together as well as\nthe rest but personally I would buy the whole\nthing just for 'Clubbed For Death' by Rob D. Overall, this album is funky, jazzy, jungle, techno\nand all the rest, and makes you get up and let off\nsteam. (8) for disc 1, (7) for disc 2.\n-album: ride - tar ant uk an The release of Ride's fourth album is, unfortunately, a posthumous one. The band have finally\nbroken up, taking with them all the promises of a band that seemed destined for greater things. This\nalbum is brilliant. Brilliant, not because there are\nhappy sing-along tracks, not because of head banging tunes or because of unbelievable melodies, but because it's one of those albums that you can\nleave playing and every now and\nthen will cause you to say to your-self, \"that's amazing\".\nHowever Ride sounded\nbefore, on this album, they play\nwith a bluesy, laid back attitude\nthat is uncharacteristic of the typical scene nowadays. Think of the\ncool beat and riffs from Weller and McCartney's rendition of 'Come Together' and you are almost\nthere. The current single, 'Black Nite Crash', is\nlike a journey back to the basics of rock. Not loud\nand overblown guitars, but playing a damn good\nriff over and over again with an attitude that only\nexists in rock. 'Castle On The Hill' is also a cracking track on acoustic guitars. It is amazing how\nbrill i andy they can play, with Mark Gardener and\nAndy Bell constantly weaving solo riffs and\nmelodies on the same track.\nTheir lyrics will never achieve the majestic\nbrilliance of songs like U2's 'Running To Stand\nStill' but there is a certain kind of realisation in\ntheir lyrics that stands out. For example, their\nrecent personal problems seem\nto be echoed in the lyric, \"the\nsadness of the road will be the\ndeath of me one day\", from\n'Sunshine/Nowhere To Run'.\nThere are songs filled with hope,\nsongs of despair and songs that\nrelate events as a matter of fact,\npurely and simply like \"...drink-ing in a hotel room, I 've got\nnowhere to run... turning my\nback to nothing, all my dreams come undone.\"\nWhatever criticism they have received, this\nseems like the album that Ride wanted.\nApparendy, the album is only going to be out for\na week. That is a deplorable marketing ploy given\nthe quality of this album. This is recommended\nwithout reservations. What a way to go out. (9)\n\n"

Luke\nsaid he was \"a bit upset\" about\nthe outcome, and Mark expressed disappointment at the low\nturnout as well. Being a first year,\nhe said he may stand again for a sabbatical position \"...in a couple\nof years, if I can make a differ-en ce.\" It has since emerged that\nthere may have been plans to\nflood at least the RS M departments with partisan literature;\nSarah White, ICU President, was\nsaid to have impounded copies of\nthe R SMU newspaper Pit after it\ncarried material overtly encouraging readers to vote for a particular candidate. Neither Sarah nor\nthe R SMU would comment on\nthe issue.\nPiers Williams, the only candidate for the job of DP(F&S) won nearly 80% of the votes cast.\nSarah Corneille's victory over\nNeil O 'Shaughnessy and James\nHandley was also decisive,\nthough Neil will now surely rank\nhas one of the best losers in\nICU's history. \"I feel wonderful,\"\nhe said shortly after hearing the\nresult, \"a great person's got the\nvote.\"\nThe plummeting turnout\nis only partly explained by the\nlack of Union cards, which only\n50% of students possess. Last\nyear's president, Lucy Chothia,\nseemed unimpressed by this\nexplanation, believing that\nImperial College Union should\nhave dealt with this before the\nelections. She hoped that it\nwould be sorted out before next\nyear's hopefuls take to the hus-tings.\nImperial shares in funding 'misery'\nBY MARK BRIDGE\nImperial College's Higher\nEducation Funding Council\n(HEFCE) grant was among the\nhardest hit in the latest formula\nworked out by the body, suffering a cut of about 3.7% overall. It\nranked 199th 'worst-off in a list\nof 206 losers. Several London\nmedical institutions and Cambridge and Cranfield Universities\nfared worst, with cuts of 4.5%.\nThe HE FCE was founded in\nMarch 1993, replacing the\nUniversities and the Polytechnics' funding Councils. It is\nusually responsible for surveying\nHigher Education Institutions'\nstudent numbers and their\nresearch activities. It also examines institutions internal distribution of their previous year's grant\nand their student numbers -checking for compliance and\npenal ising any extra student\nintake or anomalies. Each March\nit announces the distribution of\nfunding for the following year.\nOn average the HE FCE provides\n36% of the \u00a37.5 billion total\nspent on education for all institutions. Other sources of funding\ninclude local education author i ties, research councils, and profits from uni verities' own residences and catering.\nThis year it has departed\nsomewhat from its usual method\nof allocating funds because of the\nmassive cuts in education spending by the government. Institutions are now permitted to take\non up to 2% more students, and\nHE FCE have cut windfall\nallowances given to strong universities for compliance and good\nresearch, as well as drastically\nreducing safety-net provisions. It\nhas tried to achieve a cut of about\n5% across the board to stop\nsmaller colleges from suffering at\nthe expense of big research universities and medical colleges, in\nwhat the Times Higher\nEducation Supplement called a 'share-the-misery' exercise. This\nstopped some institutions from\nsuffering unsustainable cuts of up\no50% in capital funds which are\nusually allotted to financing\nestates projects, new equipment,\nand maintenance. The Council\nhas also changed the weighting it\napplies to the postgraduate head\ncount, thereby disadvantaging\nlarger research institutions.\nNationally, the largest chunk\nof HE FCE funding goes for\nteaching, with about. \u00a3640 million going to research. This year\nIC has a total teaching grant of\n\u00a321 million and a research grant\nof \u00a325 million, which with miscellaneous additions brings IC's total grant for 96/97 to just over\n\u00a358 million.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 8TH MARCH 1 9 9 6 . SEVEN\nHere's some advice for all\nyou smokers out there\nwho want to give up -never go to Germany! The proud to be s mo kers among you, however,\nshould take note that it is\na real smokers' paradise.\nCigarettes are easily available from vending\nmachines which are scattered around the streets.\nIn a country where shops\nare closed on Saturday\nafternoons and definitely\ndo not open on Sundays,\ncigarettes are practically\nthe only things you can\nbuy over the weekend.\nChildren can buy\ncigarettes from\nthese machines\ntoo. Not that they\ncan't buy them in\nthe shops anyway.\nAll they need is a piece of paper\nwith the brand\nname written on it\nand they can buy\ntheir fags easily.\nThis is because\nthey are allegedly\nbuying them for\ntheir parents, who\nsupposedly wrote\nthe note. As you\ncan imagine, it\ndoes not always\nwork that way!\nOnce the cigarettes have been bought, there\nis no shortage of encouragement\nto smoke them. Billboards everywhere are plastered with young,\nattractive, healthy people saying\nthing like: \"Ich rauch e gem\" (I like smoking) and \"HB? Ich\nauch.\ntoo).\n(HB? |Brand name Me\nSuch advertising would of\ncourse be banned in Britain. Our\nanti-smoking laws are much\nstricter, so much so that the\nword 'Rothmans' has to be\nreplaced by 'Racing' on Damon\nHill's car when he races in\nBritain. A little unnecessary, I think. And let's face it, we all\nknow what its supposed to say]\nAnyway, back to Germany.\nWe've bought our cigarettes,\nwe've been encouraged to smoke\nthem. All we need to do now is\nfind a suitable place. Again, no\nproblem. There are 'no smoking'\nsigns in a few shops, but otherwise there appear to be no\nrestrictions. Once, I was in a no-smoking carriage of a train when\nsomebody lit up. The conductor\nasked her very politely to put the\ncigarette out. The response was a very indignant, \"But the smoking\ncarriage is full, where am I supposed to smoke? I have the right\nto smoke if I want to.\"\nAnd, of\ncourse, she\nwas right. I, however, also\nhave the right\nto fresh air,\nwhich is very\nhard to find in\nGermany. Restaurants\ndo not have\nno smoking sections, a fact which has\ndecreased my\nenjoyment of\nmany an otherwise pleasant meal,\n\"a \u2014\u2014\u00ab\"*' I was amazed to\nvisit a German cinema\nwhere smoking was not prohibit-ed. As well as being unwelcome\nto non-smokers, it's also surely a fire hazard.\nWhilst in Germany, I was\noften asked by stunned youths\nwhy I did not smoke. Having\nbeen impolite enough to refuse\ntheir offered cigarettes, I had to\nexplain myself;\n\"Well, pregnant women can\nharm their babies by smoking.\"\n\"But you're not pregnant,\nare you?\"\n\"No, but it's easier to\nnever start than to have to\ngive up should it be\nrequired.\"\n\"Yeah, I suppose so...\"\n\"Then, of course,\nthere's the increased risk\nof getting lung cancer,\nchronic bronchitis, emphysema, heart diseases... Oh,\nand women on the pill\ndouble the risk of blood\nclots by smoking...\"\nAnd, just as I was\nlaunching into a long list of\nillnesses proven to be\nlinked with smoking, from\nsomewhere in the room\nwould come a loud,\nphlegm y cough. But even\nthen, my point was not\nnoted:\n\"But my Grandad\nsmoked 40 a day from the\nage of 20, and he lived to\nbe 89. And he didn't die of\nlung cancer the.\"\n\"No, but you don't know how long he may\nhave lived if he hadn't smoked. Smoking can\nbreak down the immune\nsystem and make you susceptible to diseases you\notherwise wouldn't catch.\"\nAnd so it would go on,\nboth sides remaining\nadamant. It's one thing if\npeople are aware of the\ndangers and still smoke,\nbut refusing to accept that\nit's even bad\nfor you\nthat's something differ-ent.\nWhile I was in\nGermany, I had to have a lung X ray\nto check for\nTB. I didn't have it, but was\ninformed that my\nlungs were full of\ntar, and that various 'bits' in\nmy lungs that help the\nimmune system were\ndestroyed. (I don't know\nwhat or how, I'm not a medic and it was\nexplained to me in\nGerman). Apparently,\nsuch things are usually\nseen in people who've\nbeen smoking for some\n20 years. As a person\nwho's never smoked a cigarette, and never felt\nthe urge to do so, I found\nthis rather worrying.\nI have, however, passively\nsmoked many cigarettes,\nand will no doubt continue to do so because of my\nlove for British pubs.\nOnly passive smoking can\nexplain the state of my\nlungs. Because of this, I appreciate most of the\nBritish anti-smoking laws,\nand I am grateful to\nBritish smokers for being\ngenerally more considerate than their European\ncounterparts. Although I would like to see less\nsmoking, I respect a per-son's right to smoke. We\nneed places where smokers can smoke, and places\nwhere non-smokers can\nbreathe easily. It seems\nthat just maybe we're\nactually getting it right in\nBritain - or at least, better\nthan Germany.\nby Marcia Symonds\n\n"
