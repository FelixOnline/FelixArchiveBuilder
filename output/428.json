The current trend is to show\nfilms, such as Night Porter and The\nPassenger, which have been released a few years ago, but which are no longer\nbeing shown in London. There is also a selection of golden\noldies, such as Casablanca and The\nGeneral, films which have become classics for all time. Also the Society tries to\nput on a variety of foreign films, some\nwell-known like Cha bro l's Le Boucher\nand Ray's Company Limited, which will interest an English speaking audience.\nThere are even some big films, such as\nSummer of '42.\nOne way or another Films oc tries to\nput on a varied show, so how about\ncoming to the Film Society stall at\ntomorrow's Freshers Fair to find out\nmore about the films and the Society.\nA Chodorowski\nOpsoc\nMusical society\nwith a difference\nOP SOC is a musical society with a difference.

    "content": "2 - FELIX, OCTOBER4 th1976 Whilst you've been away many things\nhave been happening and FELIX has\ndone its best to keep everyone at IC in the pi cut re. There have been two Post Graduate editions of FELIX, one on\nJuly 30th and the other on September 17th. Summer Accomodation\nThe first of these editions reported\nthat the College Summer Accommodation\nScheme, whereby Southside and L instead Hall rooms are let out to tourists and\nconference guests, was being run on\nnew lines to ensure that the scheme was more financially watertight, than had\nhitherto been the case. However there were teething troubles,\nas our front page story reported. Pre valent amongst these was the question\nof unused meal tickets. When tourists\nbook a room at Southside they have to\nbuy a \u00a31 meal ticket which they exchange\nfor breakfast in the refectory. Many\nvisitors leave unused tickets in their\nrooms when they finally depart. These\ntickets had in the past been used by\nstudent cleaners. Amidst some confusion\nthis practice was stopped by Domestic\nSecretary Captain Lindley. There was also some uncertainty at\nto how much the cleaners should be\npaid; at the end of the first week they\ngot 7pless than last year! Nevertheless\npraise has been forthcoming on the\ndecision to appoint a permanent SAC Manageress, Tricia Wigfall, instead of\nthe usual nine month appointment.\nSport\nTerm had barely ended when news of\na different sort filtered through from\nHenley and Montreal. The Boat Club had a most successful year at the\nHenley Royal Regatta, with our l st VIII\nreaching the quarter finals of the Ladies Plate and the 2nd VIII being beaten only\nWhilst you\nwere away\nOR\nSUMMER NEWS ROUND-UP\nMontreal\nAt the Montreal Olympics Tim Crooks\na former post graduate student in the Mechanical Engineering's Lubrication Laboratory, won a silver medal in the rowing\neights. Two other members of the depart-ment, Neil Keron (cox less fours,rowing)\nand Dr Graham Paul( fencing) were not as successful. Student Houses\nDuring the vacation ren n ovation work\nwas carried out on some of the student\nhouses owned by the College. Delays in commencing the work brought fears that 51\nand 69 Evelyn Gardens, together with 14\nQueensbury Place would not be ready for\nstudent occupation at the start of term.\nIn the second PG Felix we reported that\nquick action by College officials and\nUnion President Nick Brayshaw had unexpectedly enabled the work to be speeded up,\nThe work has now finished in Evelyn Gardens, and students started moving in last\nweek.\nTricia Greenwood\nResidence Officer Tricia Greenwood\nresigned in August. Talking to Felix about\nher decision she complained about the\nunder staffing of Residence Office and the\nrefusal of College Administration to do\nanything about it.\nBlazes\nThe first of two main fires took place\non July 15th, when a faulty lift motor\ncaught fire, causing the whole of Southside\nto be evacuated for 30 minutes. Damage\nwas minor. Two months later the stage of\nthe Union Concert Hall was being sanded\nwhen one of the dust bags being used\ncaught fire. Pandora Theatre's Andy Stephenson and IC Union DP Derrick Everett\nwere the heroes, whose prompt action con fined damage to four square feet of stage\nfloor.\nClem\nRSM Union mascot Cle m,a1926 Morris\nCommercial lorry, is off the road following\ntransmission failure at Portsmouth. C lem had gone South to take part in the Isle of Wight Railway Centre's Summer Show. At the time this meant that all three C CU motorised mascots were off the road.\nRCS'\nIt was with regret that Felix had to record the deaths of two well-known R CSU personalities, Ron Kill and Jan Vincent. On both a Coroner's verdict of accidental\ndeath was recorded.\nIMPORTANT VISA INFO\nOverseas students are now advised to\napply for a new visa to stay in Britain at\nleast 14 days before their old visa expires.\nFollowing a recent court case, the Home\nOffice requires that any visa appeal (in the\ncase of an unsuccessful applicant ) must\nbe held before his present visa expires. Late applicants now face the risk of dep-or tion should there be insufficient time to\nto hear their appeal. Further details from\nthe IC Union Office. "

We are told that be is\nquickly bundled into a waiting\nUnion van and driven, bound\nhand and foot, to an obscure\nback door to IC's Electrical Engineering department. Here,\nso the story goes, the wretched\nstar is led to a heavily soundproofed room 108, where he is\nseated in a soft chair \u2014 the\nelectrodes carefully hidden\nfrom view.\nTerry-Thomas, Dirk Bogarde,\nPeter Cushing, Gregory Peck and Christopher Lee to name\nbut a few, have suffered the\nsame hideous fate \u2014 the STOIC\ninterview. One by one they\nhave come, had extracts from\ntheir previous films shown and\nheld in evidence against them.\nOne by one they leave the\nstudio shaken, somewhat the\nworse for the experience for\nthe solace of St George's Hospital. STOIC deny all; the court\nappearances, unpleasant noises from the Ele c Eng basement \u2014\nthey're all lies. In vain STOIC point out that Leslie Phillips has appeared on national TV since his STOIC interview and, contrary to popular opinion,\nnone of the marks show. They\nalso point to Barry Humphries\n(alias Dame F. dna F. ver edge) who actually cane back for more,\nscalding his interviewer with\nBehind the scenes\nhot tea in the process. All this is rather unfair;\nSTOIC is really quite a serious\nproposition, and it is in view of the quality of STOIC transmissions that well known\npersonalities grace the camera\nwith such regularity (without\npayment).\nThere are two major series\ncurrently produced by STOIC: Film Talk, in which the\naforementioned film stars have\nappeared, is a highly success ful programme. It is\ntransmitted not only in College, but also to schools, poly-technic s, etc, via the Inner\nLondon Education Authority's( ILEA) Channel 7 television\nnetwork.\nThe second production,\nLunchbreak, is STOIC'S raison d'e tre. Providing a few shy people having their\nintroverted coating stripped.\nAppearing on STOIC is an\nexperienced transcending verbal description, until\nyou've tried you cannot\nunderstand what makes a good\ninterviewer. \" A spirit of\nadventure must be a prerequisite'\nand a masochistic nature is a help if you are to see recordings\nof yourself played back. One\nhealthy aspect at STOIC is that no-one will bite your\nhead off if you make a mistake, lest the same thing\nshould happen to them.\nIt takes guts to make an\ninterviewer; you have to keep\ncontrol of interview by\nconsidering the replies to your\nquestions, formulating your\nnext question, listening to the\ndirector in the earphone and\nThe Student Television of Imperial College( referred to as STOIC) were not transmitting in College last term as the television studio was moving house. However, their transmissions on the\nILEA TV network to schools, polytechnics and other London colleges has continued to attract attention. The most recent\ncame in the Times Higher Education Supplement (THES) with\nan article by Jeremy Clift. With the resumption of programmes in C^'le ge, some explanation is in order.\" Like all media at IC, STOIC is not a society\nbut a publication.\nStand-by Studio\nweekly news, views and\nmagazine programme, Lunchbreak rounds up the more\nunusual aspects of IC life \u2014\nsuch_ as presidential streaks\naround the Albert Hall( captured\nfull frontal by STOIC on a portable video-tape recorder,\nunion elections and Harold\nWilson's visit. STOIC members tend to\nsettle into two distinct groups\n\u2014 in front and behind the\ncamera. The technical side\n(behind camera) consists of\nslightly unexpected occupations\nsuch as cartooning and graphic\ndesign. The other side is the\npreserve of presenters and\ninterviewers. It should be said that those who think they will be good in front of a camera\nhave not always turned out so; the reverse is also true with a avoiding the temptation of\nlooking down at any notes.\nMost of STOIC's programmes\nare recorded (a fact they would\nnever divulge to anyone),\nalthough there are often live\nprogrammes. This is because\nthere are just too many\nparameters involved in making\naTV programme.\nTelevision programme production an unusual pastime,\none which few will have the\nopportunity to repeat. For the\nviewer student television in ICh as shown itself to provide\na kind of programme which can only be produced in an\nen ivor no ment such asIC, whether the subject matter is Union elections or Glenda Jackson.

In a college which boasts more bars than\nany other in the country, (and\nthat includes the universities)\nthere has to be a good reason\nfor one in particular to be\nsingled out as ' THE BAR'. On swinging through the\ndouble doors, of windowed\nplywood and oak (respectively)\nthe Romantic's immediate view\nis stunning. Two large oak\ntables, a couple of smaller ones\nand many bare wooden stools, in front of a bar spanning the\nwidth of the room. But it is behind the bar that this Romant ic's eye will travel first, for\nit is there, behind this much\nused counter, with its ample\ndispensary of ales and lagers,\nthat you will see the finest\narrangement of pewter-ware,\nnot just in a college bar, nor\nLondon, but 'to be sure, to be\nsure' in the world.\nFor in this Union Bar, the\narray of pewter pots represents\nevery club captain, chairman,\npresident and member. And it\nis not only for the 'old members'\nof College that these exalted\npositions are held. There\nalways seems to be room on\nthe shelves for 'your' pot.\nOn a few rare days each\nyear, you may be witness to\nstrange sights; people being\nskidded across the aforementioned oak tables (take heart,\nyou should be so lucky, or so proud) as part of ' initiation' ceremonies.\nThis preamble sounds like\nan invitation \u2014 or maybe a travel brochure \u2014 and that is what it was meant to be.\nThe frequenter s of the bar\ndo not, however, take note of\nthe decor, nor interest in the\nparaphernalia. They are here\nsimply to enjoy, in the presence\nof friends, a drink. There is no\nthought of trying to live up to,\nor down to any standards \u2014\nbeyond 'Don't take yo iur glass outside, if you please.' They are just revelling in a well\nearned, well served drop of\ntheir favourite tipple. In the\nUnion Bar you can dance, you can sing, you can do anything\u2014\nor your own thing\u2014 and no-one\nworries. And I should know.

Procedure\nIt you want to book one of the above\nrooms, drop into my office (first floor,\nUnion) ask for a Bookings Form. Please\nread the section marked \"Conditions ot\nuse\". Take particular note of the clauses:(1)\" The person in whose name the\nroo om is booked shall be totally responsible for the behaviour of the guests and\nshould ensure that they leave the room\nafter the function\".(2)( A)\" Messes of a human nature\n(excreta, vomit, etc) must be cleared up\".( The Disciplinary Committee took a very\ndim view of certain violations of this\nrule last session).(8)\" Repairs or restitution resulting\nfrom any damage done to property in the\nbuilding and in excess of the amount of\nthe deposit shall be paid for by the\napplicant\". Please also note the advice about special facilities( eg stage lighting), insurance\nand performing rights licences given on\nthe form.\nFunctions will not normally be allowed\nto continue after midnight except in the\nJ CR, which is often book able until 2am. Discipline & security matters\nThis rather difficult topic follows on\nnaturally from the booking of rooms,\nsince it is after functions that unpleasantness often occurs. I would warn\neveryone using the Union that the Executive are not amused by excreta and\nvomit in the rooms, by broken furniture,\ngraffitti on walls, forced doors, smashed\nclocks and vandalised telephones that\ntoo frequently accompany the use of\nUnion rooms, especially by certain clubs\nand societ jes( who shall remain nameless).\nWe also take a dim view of the defacement\nof nomination papers, the tearing down of\nnotices and \" streaking\" through the\nUnion bu iI ding. My own powers and responsibilities are\nset out in the Union By \u2014 Laws. I may\nsuspend any member ot the Union from\nthe use of Union facilities for up to\n24 hours. Once I have done this, I expect the individuals concerned to\nleave the building at once. I shall then\nORANGE MOLE\nuse what the law describes as \" reasonable force\" to evict the miscreants; since Iam' of rather slight build and not as\nmuscular as large Football/ Rugby players\n(oops!), I hope that other members of\nthe Union will assist me. Brendan, the\nBar Manager, is very handy with the\nhurling stick which he keeps behind the\nbar, so I don't foresee any difficulties\nthere!ONLY UNDER THE MOST SERIOUS\nCIRCUMSTANCES WILL I CALL THE\nPOLICE. The last thing I want is to\ngive the Union a reputation as a roughhouse \u2014 anyone who thinks that this\nis in fact what it is, had better keep\naway from the Union before he/ she is\nsuspended.\nNoticeboards etc.\nPlease respect the Union noticeboards\nboth old and new. See Chalky' s article\nfor the Publicity Rules \u2014 these apply to\nall Union areas. Please make sure that\nposters are removed after the event -otherwise you will be fined.\nBeit Quadrangle\nUnfortunately, during the next twelve\nmonths the Quad will look rather\nunsightly, since the grass-mud areas\nare to be dug up and new drainage instal led.\nThen the grass will be reseeded around\nEaster and this should be looking good\nby next October. Please keep off these\nareas while the work is under way.\nCommittee rooms\nThe Union has spent a great deal of\nmoney (over \u00a316,000) in building and\nfurnishing the Welfare Centre and\nCommittee Rooms. The latter are the\n\" Brown Room\",\" Green Room\" and the\n\" Orange Room\", as above. These rooms\nshould be used for committee meetings\nand small gatherings \u2014 please do not ask\nfor the common room, unless you need\na room for about 50 people.\nDefects & complaints\nIf you have any complaints about the\nbuilding or find that something will not\nwork, eg doors, taps, pinball machines, or\nif you come across damaged furniture of\nany kind, please come to my office and\nenter the problem In the \" defects book\". Keys\nCould all holders of keys to Union\nrooms please give me a list of the keys\nin your possession; eg Op soc, Dramsoc,\nStoic, Jazz Club, AC C,SC C,RC C, Scab, Graffitti, etc. I am particularly\ninterested to know which' keys have been\nlost.\nFire & emergency\nThe College are particularly worried at\npresent by the danger of bombs being\nplanted in or near the college. If it is\nannounced over the public address that a bomb is suspected in the Union, for\ngoodness sake \u2014 get out(!) through the\nnearest exit and round to the other side\nof the Albert Hall, where one is reasonably\nsheltered from a blast. After the recent\nfire in the Concert Hall, we're a little\nconcerned about fire precautions.\nPlease take care - no smoking in the\nConcert Hall, especially on stage, do\nnot tamper with any electrical apparatus\nand use the ashtrays supplied for your\ndog ends. It is a discipline offence to\ntamper with fire extinguishers or hoses\nplease stop others from using them;\nyou have been warned!\nUnion facilities\nPlease note the improvements we have\nmade in the Union this summer; the new\nPool Table, the Photo Booth, the Pinball Machines and (I hope) the repaired\ntelevision (parts are due to arrive any\nday at time of writing!). Please look\nafter these items! If they do not work,\nplease refrain from kicking them \u2014 or I might kick you!\nDerrick Everett,\nDeputy President of ICU\nImportant Customs & Exercise notice\nCollege Administration has asked FELIX to publicize the\nfollowing notice about the temporary exportation of goods:\nFrom the 1st July1976 the regulation covering temporary\nexportation of equipment for repair, modification, up-dating etc,\nhas been altered to bring it into line with other EEC countries.\nThe new regulation requires that authorisation from HM\nCustoms & Excise must be obtained before the equipment is\ndispatched from College. Failure to comply, will result in\ndifficulty in getting the equipment back into this country, and\nis almost certain to involve the payment of duty and VAT. The\nnew forms required are C&E1152 and C&E1153. Equipment being temporarily exported for use on scientific projects abroad can still be exported on the form XS140( XS\n140A if being sent by post). This form is used to facilitate easy\nre-entry through customs in this country but does not cover the\ncustoms formalities of the country the equipment is being taken\ninto.\nAn AT A Carnet is used to cover foreign Customs requirements\nin cases where equipment is transported across one or more\nfrontiers. Departments should note that at least seven days' notice is required to arrange a Carnet.\nIf your department is sending equipment abroad please contact\nthe Foreign Order Section which can offer advice on transport\n(quotations etc.), supply the necessary forms, and make sure the\ncurrent regulations are observed; they also handle incoming\nconsignments, and will help with all HM Customs and Excise problems, excluding VAT.

On Saturday July24 th,80 members\nof Opsoc set out for their, now familiar,\ntour venue \u2014 Budleigh Salterton in East Devon. On arrival the local papers had gone to town with some very welcome,\nand more importantly, FREE publicity.\nThe local press hoarding s read \" Pirates at Bud leigh\" and we knew we were in\nfor a fantastic reception.\nThe opening night, normally only\nhalf-full,was completely sold out and the\nopening night reception when all the\naudience was invited to 'meet the\ncompany' was a nun calculated success. The response was maintained throughout\nthe fortnight and for the first time, we\nmanaged to sell2250 tickets \u2014 the\nmaximum.\nAs usual the middle weekend was\noccupied by rehearsal and performance\nof our Charity Concert. The Chorus\nperformed the Easter Hymn from Cavalleria Rusticana by Mascagni, with the solo\nsung by Sally He slop. There followed a series of excerpts from ' The Water\nMusic' and a group of madrigals sung\nby members of the Society. The second\npart of the Concert opened with Haydn' s' London' symphony and closed with\nVaughn Williams' choral masterpiece\n'Serenade to Music', Soloists Delith\nBrook, Deborah Kemp, Tim Johnson and\nJohn Barratt; solo violin David Greed. The shows themselves were a roaring\nsuccess under the baton of Michael\nWithers, an ex IC chemist and the\nskillful production of Peter Mills, well-known to Opsoc enthusiasts as a performer rather than a man behind the\nscenes. There follows a transcript of a revue published in the Exmouth &\nEast Devon Journal on Saturday August\n7th: The Zoo was the one-act curtain\nraise r. It is a slight piece intended as a satire on Grand Opera. However the\nlibretto of BC Stevenson lacks the\ntrenchant humour of Sullivan's more\nusual collaborator, and although it was\npleasant entertainment, its presentation\nwas mian ly of historical interest.\nI think it was a very wise move to\nset the scene in 1905, (the opera was\nfirst produced in 1875) as that era of\ndecaying empire seems wholly appropriate\nto the melodramatic proceedings. 1\nthought I could detect a hint of the\nmusic-hall in some of the staging, but it\nmay have been coincidence.\nAlthough chorus and soloists all were\nin good voice, Delith Brook as the lovely\nLaetitia deserves especial mention. Her\nquasi-Mozartian coloratura flourishes\nwere delightful.\nThe main work of the evening was of\ncourse \"The Pirates of Penzance and\nand it was a first-rate production. My\nhero of the evening was Roger Woodward,\nwho sang the Major-General's song at\nsuch an impressive rate of knots that the\norchestra were hard pressed to keep up\nwith him. Teresa Quinn was a charming\nMabel and Max Taylor a convincing\nFrederic.\nAll in all it was difficult to find faults\nof much consequence, and the enthusiastic\ncapacity audience generated a feeling\nof well-being which 1 am sure must have\nbeen felt on the other side of the foot-lights. The producers, Roger Woodward\nand Peter Mills and musical Director\nMichael Withers are to be congratulated\non the high standard they have achieved,\nand I feel sure that the Society's next\nvisit to Budleigh Salterton will he\nkeenly anticipated.\nPerhaps local producers of plays and\noperas could take a lesson from the\nImperial College production on achieving\nmaximum effect from the minimum of\nscenery and props.\nToni Holloway \u2014 Exmouth Journal\nThe next Opsoc Production will be\n\" Orpheus in the Underworld\" by Offenbach\nat IC in February.\n8:*:*>:*>:*:*:\u00ab \u00bb ^ *\n\u2022X'x'x'x' x'x'^^^y s X'l tt fy K& X'X^ Love and affection all the way\nI 'VE SEEN Joan live three times in the\nlast six months; each time she' s impressed\nme as an up-and-coming artist who\ndeserves to make the big time. Perhaps\nI should say Joan' s live work is mes m eric, her contrasting repertoire of folk and\ncamp-fire odes leaving audiences with a strange sense of fulfilment - something\nyou don't expect from a support artist.\nGiven that Joan Armatrading is\nprimarily a stage artist, I suppose I'm at a disadvantage when reviewing her\nlatest LP since I 've heard most of the\nmaterial live. However Glyn Johns (a famous producer no less) and Joan have\nsucceeded in recreating her stage\natmosphere on at least half of the LP, namely the first side. Another success of the production is\nthat Joan' s vocal and guitar work are\nboth well highlighted. The latter is Joan Arma trading' A&M Records\nextremely good and together with Joan' s creative ability in vocal, lyrical and\nmusical departments gives her a rare\nset of talents.\nThe album presents songs of varying\ntempos and moods from the pro v actively assertive 'Down To Zero' which opens\nthe LP, to more gently romantic ballads\nlike 'Help Yourself and 'Love and\nAffection'. The latter is my favourite;\nit must be the most natural song on the\nLP, with the stage atmosphere precisely\nreproduced. The song gradually unveils\nitself j slowly engulfing you. Joan' s deep\ncroaking voice is ever present (Pingpong\nthought the singer was Ni is son1):s axa phone adds the scintillating touch of\nmagic.\nThe only track on the first side that\nperhaps doesn't just manage to manifest\nRevamped oldie fails to please\nIN THE 'est two years there's been\nquite a glut of records solely containing\nre-released material, especially when an\nartist has changed label and become\nsuccessful. My normal policy is to give\na track listing and throw in a few\npertinent comments. After all if people\nwanted the material they would have\nbought it on first release.\nHaving been slightly favourably\ndisposed to Andy's recent efforts I was prepared to give this LP a second glance,\ndespite the lack of sleeve notes on\nmusicians and irrespective of my patchy\nmusical memory for the '70\u201471 era\nfrom which these cuts are taken.\n'Andy Fairweather Low' \u2014 RCA Out of the LP's nine, songs only\nfour are worth talking about. The best\n'/ Hear You Knocking' f Yes that one) is the album's last track; by that time I'd got suitably na used off after many a second-rate track. This track though is superb just for Fairweather's virtuoso\nguitar playing \u2014 literally from the word\ngo. Vocals aren't bad either. Overall\nthe cut is marginally better than Dave\nEdmunds' for excitement.\nOther goodies are 'Natural Sinner';\n'nuff said and ' Lay It On Me , which\nessentially is Natural Sinner Mark 2.\n'Beginning From An End', a fine brass/ its stage excellence is 'Water With The\nWine'. Nevermind one can't expect\nmiracles.\nIn comparison to the first side the\nsecond is a little shallow in feeling,\nalthough Joan' s somewhat innate sense\nof ry th m, prevalent throughout the LP, comes to the fore in this section. The best track here is 'Like Five' ably\nill u strat in q her vocal and quit ar dexterity.\nSch s Roses?\nWhilst aided and abetted by a fine set\nof musicians Joan' s talent shows through\nremarkably well on this LP, and the\nLP's certainly worth purchasing. One\nsmall point is that the album gradually\nwalks up behind you and grabs you\ntotally and without warning after about\nsix plays. So beware IT GROWS ON YOU. Clive Dewey\nguitar instrumental number completes the\nenjoyable tracks.\nThe rest of the LP is rather second-rate, drab and tedious and my ears\nwere pleased to see the back of it. Not\nan album I'd recommend, even though it\ndoes have its moments. Generally if the\nLP was going to sell well it would have\ndone so in 1971.\nClive Dewey\nSide One:- Natural Sinner; You Ain't No\nFriend; Looking for the Red Label; Road\nTo Freedom.\nSide Two: Lay it On Me; God Cried\nMother; Don't Mess With Cupid; Beginning\nfrom an End; I Hear You Knocking.\n\n"

The Club will now\nplay the Southern League winners for the Home Counties Cup. The League is played between five local clubs, each team playing the others twice, one home and one away match.\nIC started cautiously by\ndrawing their first match\nagainst Unilever. The next two\nmatches were wins for IC against Silver Wings and the\nce lib rated Harrow Oak; the\nrest of the matches were\ndraws. The two wins, however,\nwere enough to beat our\nnearest opponents, Parson's Green, by one point. IC now\nplay a team from ICI at\nBracknell (the Southern League winners) for the Cup. England champion\nAside from winning leagues\nthe Club's main . aim is to\nprovide the facilities and an informal atmosphere in which\nto play croquet. Free coaching is provided by our President,\nProfessor BG Neal, who was All England champion in\n1972\u201473. We are very fortunate\nto have two lawns close at\nhand situated next to the\nQueen's Tower. These are\nopen weather permitting, from\nApril to September.\nIf you are interested in\njoining the Club or are just\ncurious in this ignoble game\ncome and see us at the Fresher s Fair or contact P Walker Ci vEng2 or EA Wyatt and N Greatorex Ele c En gPG s. Team members:- Mike Roberts,\ncaptain: Austin Harrup: Tom\nFortescue; Salah Sadek; Mike\nLea: Nigel Greatorex\nNigel Greatorex\nCricket\nSummer tour\nruns, having bowled out the\nopposition for 146. This was followed by an enjoyable game\nagainst Babbacombe, the\nresult of which was lost in the\npost match celebrations.\nAfter the revelry\nThe 1976 cricket season\nbegan very auspiciously for IC\nwith a234 run victory over\nBalliol, Oxford, on May 1st. Together with the next fourteen\ngames this produced 11 wins,\n3 draws and 1 defeat. These\nresults were due mainly to\nexcellent seam bowling by\nMessrs Millard and Bramley and\na batting line-up which scored\nconsistently well. This good run ended on\n9th June when we lost to\nKingston Poly. This marked the\nstart of a bad run for the team,\nmuch weakened by examination\nabsentees, which only ended on\n19th June against Whitton in the\nleague, IC winning by 7\nwickets. This put us in a good\nframe of mind for the summer\ntour.\nEnthusiastic tour party\nAlthough not particularly\nstrong, the touring party was very enthusiastic and we\nanticipated doing reasonably\nwell. However we started off\ndisastrously at Southampton,\nhaving bowled the opposition\nout for 123 (Millard 5 for 57).\nIC were then bowled out for\n69. We did improve on this\nperformance at Yelverton and a draw was achieved. The next\ngame, against Exeter CC, saw one of the best performances\nfrom IC throughout the season.\nExcellent fielding ensured that\nExeter, the 1975 Devon league\nchampions, were restricted to\n141 off-35 overs (Millard 3 for\n60 and Sprake 3 for 54). Hall was responsible for two\nrun-outs. Our chances of\nvictory were lost with the\nwickets of Ghosh and Paul. However a creditable 105 for 8\n(off 35 overs) was achieved. Best match\nProbably the best match of\nthe tour was against Brinham.\nIC declared at 154 for 8\n(Sparke 4 1 , Ghcsh 26) setting\nthe opposition 155 runs in 2\nhours. On a pitch of low bounce\nthey achieved this target in the\nlast over Jo reach 157 for 7 ,\nGhosh taking 3 for 39.\nAfter four matches on\nconsecutive days a tired IC\nteam lost to Plym stock by 79\nNew but successful\nNEWLY FORMED, Riding Club had *a very successful start\nlast session. The aim of the\nclub was (and is) to cater for\nas wide a range of riding\ntastes as possible, whilst\nminim ising the strain on\nmembers' pockets. Last year\nwe operated every Wednesday\nafternoon, running both\nbeginners' and 'advanced'\nlessons and also a hack.\nThis session we will co nt in ue to meet on Wednesdays,\nour probable programme being\nadvanced team lessons in the\nafternoon and novices' lessons in the evening. Our teams\nwill be competing in the\nUniversity of London league \u2014\nthe matches involving a dressage test and a show-jumping course. So if riding interests you, whether you're a complete\nbeginner or an 'expert' come\nalong to pur stand at Er esher s' Fair and to the first club\nmeeting on Thursday October\n7th at Room 407A in Electrical Engineering.\nOtherwise Contact:Adam Rawicz-Szcerbo (Elec-Eng 2)\nNicola Whitehead (Zoology 2)\nSteve Jackson (Elec Eng 2)\nAfter the revelry we were\nback to cricket against South\nDevon. They batted first\nscoring 160 for 7 declared.\nThere was no effective\nresistance from IC apart from\n53 by Ghosh; IC were all out\nfor 86. At Yeovil another\nlandmark was passed when\nAlan Watling scored his first\nruns of the tour. Though IC scored only 105 Yeovil were\nhard pressed to finish at 107\nfor 8. Whilst the tour didn't produce the results we had hoped for, it was enjoyed\nthoroughly by all. League century\nAfter the tour we returned to\nthe league in London. Against Motspur Park's217 for 8, IC reached 176 for 9, G ho sh76 and Mark Lawless29 being\nthe main scorers. The following\nweek saw an IC player score a century for the first time in\ntwo years, J eh Be shaw scored\n126 in a partnership with\nRob Young (68). IC finished\nat 237 for 4 declared.\nMorden, to their credit,\nwent for the runs, but were\nall out for 184 (D Boyd 5 for\n45). This proved to be IC's best win in the league and\nwe eventually finished\nmidway. The rest of the\nseason contained a few\ngood performances, notably\nagainst London Transport\nand East Barnet Valley. Overall the 1976 season\nhas been more successful than most, mainly due to the\ntremendous enthusiasm of the\nfresher s, several of whom\nplayed in the first team.\nTom Ghosh\nCricket Captain\nRC C TRANSPORT The RC C Transport Sub-Committee runs five Ford Transit\nvehicles on behalf of the IC Union.

After the long hot\nsummer which saw most of you waiting\nfor ' A' level results, UCC A forms, college\nletters, and the start of term, we can now look forward to the Autumn term.\nAs you sit reading this Fresher' s edition of FELIX, it is a sobering\nthought for you that...you have just\nentered one of the true Bastions of\nscience and technology. Examiners,\nLEA's, magistrates and parents willing, you will spend at least three years here\nin the search of knowledge, truth and a degree. Your three years at University are\noften the most formative years of your\nlife, so let's start forming...\nFirstly, let's form some ideas about\nme, the President. The days of Tom\nBrown, Flashman and Rugby School\ndon't extend to IC Union. Before I was elected to this heady position, (actually\neveryone said ' Here' s a likely looking\nmug' and then the buggers voted for me),\nI was a student in Materials Science,\nand, with a sketchy, beer-s oden brain\nand set of lecture notes, managed to\nswing a2:2 degree. Remember, | am an\nordinary student with the same ideas\nand problems as all of you - I live in\nthe student halls( Linstead), I eat in the\nsame re fec s( If I must), drink in the same\nbars (usually the Union) and, most\nimportant, scrape a living off the same\ngrant as you. So, dont be scared of coming\nup and introducing yourself, 'cause I 'll\ntalk to anyone for a pint of ' E'. Seriously,\nI feel that it's important for the President\nto be approachable and that is one of\nmy aims - to meet as many people as\npossible.\nPRES\nCUTTINGS\nby IC Union President\nNick Brayshaw\nNow let's get down to some serious\nUnion business (I 'll keep it brief).\nFirstly, the Union is not something\nfrom which you can divorce yourself.\nWithout you, the Union, by it's very\nname, does not exist. You are a member\nof the Union and in the same way as you\nwill draw benefits from being a member,\nthe Union draws benefit from your\nmembership. The issues in which I become involved must, by necessity, be\nthose which are of importance to you. Remember that when I make a stand on\nRefectories, Halls, fees or whatever, I need your support in providing a platform\nfor my stand. You know what the next\nsentence is going to say, because I cannot implore you strongly enough to\nattend Union meetings. Before you come\nto the first meeting (on Thursday) don'tbi i lId up a preconception that the Union\nis full of hacks and that aUG M is\nwhere we plan sit-ins or send telegrams\nto Allende, or Vorster. AUG M has two\nfunctions:\n(1) I try to explain( in two-syllable\nwords) what the hell I have been up to.\nIf you agree with what I have been doing,\nor propose to do, give me the support to\ncontinue.\n(2) AUG M is an opportunity for you to\ntell me what to do (in both senses) and to\nchop me down if I go astray. The U GM is an arena where all you have to do to\nget me, or the Union collectively to do\nsomething, is to put your hand in the air\nand speak your mind.\nRemember, your language won't shock\nme - if you want to stand up and tell me\nwhat a lousy, foul-mouthed rat-bag I am\nthen go ahead (you'll get a hell of a reply, by the way). Also if you want to\nthrow bouquets (or money) then feel free.\nAll you have to do is come to the meeting\nand put your hand in the air. Enough of\nthis Union business... Lastly, I try to write these articles\nevery week \u2014 some weeks they are\nextremely boring, the other weeks it's just plain boring. Read it though, at\nleast you' ll know I'm still around.\nAnother way you' ll know I'm around is\nif you see someone whizz past you with a red Austin Mini or no clothes or both...it's me.\nWELFARE MATTERS\nThe Welfare Centre is situated at the top of the\nUnion Building( turn left on\nemerging from the lift), and is open 12.30 to 1.30pm Monday\nto Friday. There you can find\ninformation on topics ranging\nfrom landlord problems to\ncontraception - from getting\nlegal aid to student discounts. We also have a supply of tube\nand bus maps. Mondays,\nWednesdays and Fridays it is\nstaffed by student(s) and on\nTuesdays and Thursdays by\nDon Addlington, the Student\nCounsellor. Every Wednesday\nlaw students from the LSE come along to give free advice. The Union Solicitor can also\nbe consulted via the Centre or\nThe Union Office. The Centre\nis also on the phone \u2014\ninternal: 2898.\nThere will be a stall at the\nFreshers Fair( l st floor)\nwhere you can see the kind of\ninformation the Centre has. Help\nPlease drop by if you would\nlike to help out at the Centre\nonce a week. Another somewhat\nimportant point \u2014 our intended\nWelfare Officer, having failed to return, leaves one of our\nmost vital Union posts vacant.\nThe job could best be filled\nby 2nd years upwards. Anyone\nwho 'is interested come and\nhave a chat with me about\nwhat is involved. I can be\nfound via the Centre or the\nUnion Office. SUE KALICINSKI\n'Acting' Welfare Officer\nWARNING\nThe National Westminster Bank, local Police and\nSecurity Officers at Imperial College are becoming\nincreasingly concerned at the number of thefts of\ncheque books, cheque cards and credit cards taking\nplace on the College Premises. In the main thefts\noccur from jackets left unattended in offices and\nlecture rooms.\nWe ask all customers to ensure that all such items\nare kept quite separately on their persons and that\nevery precaution is taken to safeguard them at all\ntimes.\nImperial College\nUnderwater\nClub\nIntroductory\nMeeting.\nFilms,\nTalk, etc.\n6pm.

This sum fs for overtime\nwork by FELIX litho-printer Ian Morse, who in one week\nput in 57 extra hours, necessary to enable the Handbook\nto be finished by its deadline of 13th August'.\nThis date was given to Mr Ekpenyong and FELIX by\nRegistry via IC Union Honarary Secretary John (Chalky)\nWhite; it transpired after completion that Registry did not\nin fact require the Handbook until 20th August'. However\nthe Union Executive decided to trim a week off the\navailable time, so that they could study the Handbook in\ndepth, and then write a Freshers' letter to be included in\nthe Registry mailing'. With this extra week at the FELIX unit's disposal, it is unlikely that overtime payments\nwould have been necessary; as it is, the Handbook has\nover-run its budget of \u00a3200 by twice that figure'.\nFurthermore it seems likely\nthat fur ore will develop over\nthe actual content of the\nHandbook; two CC Us, the\nRoyal School of Mines Union\nand City & Guilds Union,\ndid not submit entries, neither\ndid many Union clubs. Deputy\nPresident Derrick Everett\nsummed up the feelings of the\nUnion Officials, 'It's not so\nmuch what was in it, but what\nwas left out that mailers'.\nMany officers, including\nPeter Teague (last year's President) and Chalky White,\nare unhappy that the editor\nwas working in Harrods during\nthe last four weeks of his Felix sabbatical. This they\ncite as the main reason for the\nrushed editing that has\nresulted in what they term a 'shoddy' handbook. Whilst\nacknowledging the effect of\nhis absence, Mr Ekpenyong\nwas keen to point out 'That one\nof the main sections of the\nHandbook, Welfare, did not\ncome in to be typeset until\nfour days before printing\nactually finished.\nNearly blank pages\nAt one point, the Union\nExecutive was debating\nwhether or not to send out the\nHandbook in the Registry\nmailing to fresher s.

    "content": "FELIX, OCTOBER4 th197613 Film Editor Paul Ekpenyong looks at some of the Summer's better films\nFilm crop un scorched despite\nlong hot Summer\nIt has been a good summer, the sun\nhas shone long and continuously,\nunfortunately causing a drought. Yet despite, or in spite, of this there has been\na good yield from the film crop this\nsummer.\nThe Omen stands out the most at the\nmoment because of the massive publicity\nsurrounding it since its recent release.\nCritically acclaimed by the press, it\nstands out as the most frightening film\nsince \" Psycho\". Strangely compelling,\nthe tension and terror is deftly, and\nslowly built up until strained, taught\nnerves come near to breaking point.\nDefinitely not a film for chickens \u2014 even strong men will come away\nperspiring.\nThe Omen stars Gregory peck and Lee Remick.\nLess strenuous and miles more\nentertaining, Bugsy Malone must rank\nas the oddest and most lovable musical\nthat's ever been made. Set in the gangster\n30's with all the parts played by\n\" FUTURE WORLD\"( Brent Walker, A) directed by Richard T Heffron;\nstarring Peter Fonda and Blythe\nDanner.\nImagine that your wildest fantasies\nhave been made possible by technology.\nThat you can, say, joust with medieval\nknights, fight with Roman gladiators,\nsatiate your every sexual pleasure or\neven ski on the red snows of Mars. Then\nyou have Delos, a holiday centre that\nmakes Buthins look like some primeval\nthrow-up.\nDelos has been rebuilt after the\ncarnage at Westworld when suns hinging robots went out of control and shot-up\nguests. The new set-up is declared\ntotally safe by its creators who invite\nthe media to look round the establishment.\nIt is thus that two hacks of the\nmedia, Tracy Ballard( Blythe Danner)\nand Chuck Browning (Peter Fonda)\nfind themselves exo erie nc ing the delights\nof Futureworld and themselves at Delos. Many important political and public\nfigures also patron is e this ' Utopia of\nthrills, spiff s and bangs.\nBefore they depart, however, Chuck is approached by Frenchy, a Delos technician, who warns him of sinister going-ons at\nDelos. Unfortunately the ba dies snuff him\nout before he can spill any more beans.\nAnyway,- our two intrepid reporters\n(sic) arrive at Delos and after much\ncavorting about in Futureworld they\nbump into Harry. Harry is one of the few\nremaining humans at Delos and was children (none of whom are older than\n15), it is a superb satire of this genre\nof movies. It would immeasurably spoil\nyour film to tell you any more about it\nexcept to suggest you go and see the\nfilm'itself.\nOn the other hand, however, I will not\nmar your enjoyment of Clint Eastwood' s The Outlaw Josey Wales by telling\nyou that it's about a man out for revenge.\nWales is a simple homesteader who\njoins a band of renegades to hunt down\nthe men who killed his wife and son and destroyed his property. Yet behind\nthis deceptively simple story are many\nfacets of life which are subtly brought\nout. A powerful explosive and often\ntouching film, Jose y Wales is definitive\nof Eastwood as an actor and also gives proof of his directorial talents.\nEqually powerful and disturbing Is\nMichael So ces e's Taxi Driver. Climaxing in devastating, almost senseless, killing, Taxi Driver gives a bleak portrayal of\nwhat life in New York is all about. The\nFrenchy' s friend. The trio team up to\nfind out what is going on, Harry\neventually gets murdered and in a fairly spectacular ending, Chuck and\nTracy fight it out with their doubles.\nOn the whole, a reasonably entertaining film although the acting is somewhat nondescript.

CONCERT TICKETS Tickets for the current series of BBC Radio classical concerts are now\navailable from Jen in the Union Office The concerts feature the BBC Symphony Orchestra and are all at studios\nin Maida Vale. sex, violence, degradation, filth, drugs\npoverty are brought into stark focus\nthrough the eyes of a cabby, brilliantly\nplayed by Robert de Niro. If this is all getting a bit too heady\nfor you, then take a break and pop\nalong to see Neil Simon's Death by\nMuder. Not only is the title absurd, so is the film. I mean, what can you do but laugh yourself silly when a deaf and\ndumb maid bursts into the room and tries\nto scream about the dead butler? Really, I heard of black humour, but this is\npositively the limit.\nThere are two other films worth\nmentioning. They are Hitchcock' s Family Plot described by its publicity\nas diabolically entertaining \u2014 more like\ndiabolically self-indulgent if you ask me.\nI 've heard of black humour, but this\nis positively the limit,\nstarring Anthony Quinn, seems not much\nmore than the \" spectacular\" it is!

Phillip Good hand Tait, ostensibly a songwriter as opposed to a performer,\nhappens to write some of the most\namazing songs, which, had they been\nwritten twenty years ago, would certainly\nrate as standards today.\nOceans Away is his first recording\nin two years and marks his first album for\nthe Chrysalis label. The LP features ten\nsongs, each of which has been written in\nthe old style of songwriting - with the\naccent on melody and poetic lyrics. Standout tracks are ' Old Fashioned Love',' Love's Like A Song', ' Jewel' and the title track. Mingled with the songs are\nsome interesting string arrangements,\ncourtesy of Robert Klrby, together with\nsome fresh production from John Burgess. The album does not fall into the usual\nsinger-song write rut and makes easy\nlistening. If you want to get a better\nidea of Phillip's music come along to\nthe Fresher' s concert tomorrow evening\nand hear him play.\nNigel Davis\nNondescript acting\nmars perfect world\n\n"

Up until\nthe end of July, universities\nwere able to charge only\ncertain items to their general\naccounts; these included rent,\nrates, insurance, cleaning, heating, repairs andre decorations. They will now be able, in\naddition, to charge central\nStudent\nsurvivor\nIC undergraduate student\nPaul Mower was amongst the\n32 survivors from the wooden\nminesweeper Fittleton, which\nsunk whilst participating in aN A TO exercise two weeks\nago. The Fittleton collided with the frigate Mermaid during\nthe massive exercise in the\nNorth Sea; ten of the Fittleton's crew of 42 lost their lives as\nthe 22 year old minesweeper\nplume ted to the bottom of the\nsea.\n\u2022 The Fittleton was manned\nalmost entirely from the\nLondon division of the Royal Naval Reserve. Some of the\ncrew, including Paul Mower\nhad joined the RN R barely\nfour weeks before.\nCommenting on his ordeal\nPaul, wr fo today starts his second year in the Mathematics\ndepartment, said: 7 thought I was going to die. The ship\nturned turtle and I was trapped\nunderneath. I was wearing a life jacket because I couldn't swim. I held my breath and\ngrabbed anything that came\nto hand. It seemed like an\neternity but finally I bobbed\nto the surface. The rescue\nboat arrived within minutes\nand I was pulled out of the\nwater\".\nBreak in\nThere was a break-in at\nthe Union Refectory during the\nholiday. No damage was done\nand nothing was stolen. However the intruder(s) did leave\na contraceptive device in the\ntill.. Perhaps they were\nfeeling\"short changed.\nadministrative work(such as accounting) and the salary of\none catering officer to general\naccounts. Furthermore, in\ncatering units, the cost of heat,\nlight, power and water, together\nwith miscellaneous costs cleaning materials, stationery\nand laundry- can now be charged\nto general accounts. A tIC this\namounts to \u00a320-25,000 on the\ncatering side alone.\nNo excuse\nStudent leaders and university authorities have\npressed for this type of relaxation in financing for some time.\nFor the last few years, the\nUGC has turned a blind eye to\nthe blatant flouting of its regulations by universities,\nincluding IC. The attitude of\nthe memorandum is that now\nthere is no excuse for deficits\non these accounts.\nThe new measures have\nbeen cautiously welcomed by\nIC officials. Nick Bray shaw commented: 'The way these two\naccounts have been handled\nat IC to date means that the\nnew measures will make little\nor no difference.' IC Union is not expected to follow the UL U line on price decreases. Neither\ndoes it support the UL U campaign for greater subsidies on\nthese accounts. Mr Brayshaw\nviews subsidies as a temporary\nmeasure necessary because\nstudents 'simply cannot afford\nthe charges required to make\nthese items economically\nviable.'\nThe Rector points out that\nno extra recurrent grant for\ngeneral accounts will be forth-Exam\nfailures\nCrippling exam results,\nwhich last year decimated the\nranks of Guild Union officers\nhave this year been transferred\nto Mines Union. The latter\nstart the term without a President, after the departure\nof Martin Levy. The other main casualty\nfrom Mines is Bob Longman\nwho was to be ICU Carnival\nCo-or d in at or. Two other ICU positions, Welfare and Student\nResidence, are now vacant\nfollowing the failure of Guildsmen Dave Chance and\nDave Knights, respectively,\nto get back to IC.RC SU did not suffer any\nserious casualties, despite the\ndeparture of former Broadsheet\nEditor Nigel Reditt ( Physics2). However Honorary Junior\nTreasurer Caroline Preston, who passed her exams in\nPhysics, has now decided to\nleave IC. coming from the UGC. The position for IC has not therefore\nchanged much, since it has struggled for some years to keep\nits general accounts in credit.\nIn the next year, earnest\nattempts will be made by the\nRefectory Committee, under the\nnew chairmanship of Professor E il on, to eliminate deficit\nmakers in the catering system.\nLast year, the estimated loss by refectories was \u00a357,000.\nA surplus of \u00a317,000 on the\nbar and cellar accounts brought\nthis down to \u00a340,000. The Governing Body hopes that the\nbar profits will top \u00a325,000\nthis year. Despite Union opposition, prices have been\nraised by 2pa pint and 2pa tot\n( on spirits) to achieve this.\nThe UGC measures mean\nthat refectory deficits will have\nto be trimmed by \u00a37-12,000 for\nthe catering account to achieve\nself-supporting status.\nLADIES LOOS\nDuring the Summer vacation\nalterations have been made to\nthe ladies toilet in the Union\nBuilding to prevent a reoccur-en ce of last year's rape there.\nTime switches, operated only\nby a key, now control lights\nin the East staircase of the\nbuilding and in the ladies toilet itself.\"\nThere are also alarm bell pushes in the toilet. Bells for\nthese, which are distinct from\nthose for the fire alarms, are\nplaced in the Union Bar, the\nDramsoc storeroom, the\nUnion office and Central\nSecurity in the Sherfield\nBuilding. Union officials stress that these alarms\nshould not be abused or the\nnew measures will become\nineffective.\nNUS' organ1 rationed\nIC UNION has ordered only\nfive copies of NUS's National\nStudent for the forthcoming\nacademic year. This follows a decision by NUS to charge\nStudent unions lp a copy for\nthe paper. Formerly ICU had received 500 copies of each\nissue.\nIn making their decision both this year's and last year's ICU Executive feel that the\nUnion already pays enough to\nNUS (\u00a35,000 this year) and\nthat more free services should\nbe emanating from NUS for\nthis money. Copies of future\neditions of National Student\nwill be available for reading\nin the Union Office.\nSupercheap\ndiscount\ncard\nAs plans for a nationwide\nstudent discount scheme\nmaterialise, IC Union is preparing to undercut the\nNUS scheme by \\2Vi%. The scheme is based on a discount card, to be sold by large student unions (such as\nICU) together with a handbook,\nlisting traders and services offering student discounts. The idea is that the unions would\nbuy large numbers of these\ncards and sell them, with their\nassociated handbooks, to their\nmembers at \u00a32. The union\nconcerned would then send\ndetails of card buyers to NUS, who would give the union a25% commission (50p) for each\ncard sold. IC Union will be selling the\ncards at \u00a31.75, taking only\n25p to cover postage, correspondence' and other administrative costs. In\ncoming to this decision Union\nleaders consulted their Senior\nTreasurer, Dr Ken Weale .\nThe move is likely to have\nlocal repercussions since all of NUS's90 Travel and Insurance shops will be selling the cards at \u00a3 2 . This includes\nthe NUS Travel office in IC Union and the End sleigh office\nin Old Brompton Road. Nevertheless it seems\nunlikely that NUS will take\naction against ICU for under-cutting its service organisations. In a letter to last year's ICU President, Peter Teague, discount scheme organiser\nPete An wy l said that whilst\nthe possibility of retailing\nthe card at less than \u00a32 had not\nbeen considered, 'it is up to\neach Constituent Organisation\n(of NDS) what they wish to do\nwith the ?5% (commission)'.\nThe student discount card\nwill provide students with an\naverage 10% discount at some\n11,000 retail outlets throughout\nthe country. These include\nbranches of WH Smith, Virgin Records and Ryman Ltd. Services such as the RAC and the British School of\nMotoring are also covered by\nthe scheme.\nSmaller student unions, such\nas the one at L 'Institut\nFranc a is, who do not have\nadministrative resources, will operate a different system for\nobtaining discount cards. These unions will distribute order\nforms to their members,\nsending completed forms back\nto NUS, who will issue the\ncards direct. In this case a commission of 5 - 1 0 % will be\npaid.\nIC Union has initially\nordered 200 discount cards and\nhand books, and these are now\navailable from the Union\nOffice. "

    "content": "FELIX, OCTOBER4 th19763 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nNEW FORMAT\nLet's get the formalities over; Welcome\nto IC- this is FELIX or This is IC,\nand you're welcome to FELIX.(At least\none of those should be in the right\norder!) To those who are new here,\nI hope that this rag, which appears\nweekly during term-time, will be as a guiding light through the mists of\nUnion and College affairs. And for\nthose hardy perennials (told you the\nfiver would work\u2014PP), hope you like\nthe new format. You'd better, 'cause\nwe've paid for it now.\nSeriously though, this edition\nrepresents a double first for FELIX, the first issue to use full process\ncolour and the first litho-ed UG issue\nto use a colour cover. The colour on\nthe front, and the new banner (doesn't it look sweet!\u2014var i typist) will become\na permanent feature, paid for by the\nadvertising-the rate of which amazes\neven the bank manager.\nMoney Matters\nMany people have been pressing\nfor an end to the UGC self-balancing\nregulations on catering and residence\naccounts, amongst them our own Sir\nBrian Flowers. It seems odd that once\nagain the UGC, a Government body,\nshould ask universities to perform a stunt that no Government installation\nhas recently pulled off. A stunt indeed\nfor universities to juggle with money\nthey don't possess. The new measures\nare nothing more than a self-administered placebo.\nFor the first time in three years,\nrefectory price increases do not hog\nthe headlines of the Fresher's FELIX. Mr Mooney's catering has come in for\nsevere criticism in the last year. It's all very well knocking his efforts, but\nfew could do better in his position\u2014it's not half as easy as it looks. Food\nquality has improved in the last year,\nalthough there is still no room for\ncomplacency; many outside concerns\nprovide comparable bounty without the\nlong queues.\nConstitutionally\nThe Honarary Secretary's article\ncame into FELIX barely a week ago,\nliterally as the paper went to press.\nI learnt then of his decision to\ninclude far-reaching constitutional\nchanges in the agenda for this\nThursday's Union General Meeting.\nThese would enable the Union to\nsack officers, including sabbaticals,\nif circumstances arose where IC\nstudents wished to do so. The\nmeasures also define the jobs* of\nsabbatical officers, particularly with\nregard to holiday periods. I welcome\nthe advent of such measures, although\nat the time of writing, I have not\nbeen shown a full copy of the\nproposed changes.\nHowever, I am amazed at the\nHonarary Secretary's timing. Sabbatical job descriptions and sabbatical\ncontracts were last discussed at\nCouncil over two years ago. 1 can't remember these matters being raised\nat UGM, and certainly this year's Executive have not asked for Council\nor Union advice in preparing the\nchanges. The late arrival of Mr.White's article precluded any extensive\ndiscussion in FELIX on these\nchanges.\nAt most there will be half an hour\nspent discussing the changes before\nvoting at the UGM. That's hardly\nenough time to air the subject fully.\nMoreover, large numbers of fresher s at the meeting will not know enough\nabout the Union to assess the\nmerits of the changes.\nI don't question Chalky's good\nintentions in bringing up these\nmeasures, they have been sorely\nneeded for some time. Discuss them\nat Thursday's UGM, but let's not\nvote on them until a fuller discussion\nhas taken place.\nDiscount Discount\nFull marks to ICU for undercutting\nNUS on the student discount scheme\nand passing on half of the commission\n(25p) to the students buying the cards.\nBut where does the other half go?\u2014to\ncover admin costs, says ICU. The\npermanent staff are salaried and are\npaid no extra to handle the cards.\nTelephone bills don't come into itf they are paid by College anyway)\u2014surely\nit can't cost 25p per card to post\ndetails of card purchases to Endsleigh\nStreet. Is it a genuine saving for\nstudents or two fingers to NUS?\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\nSafer Insurance\nMany of you will, no doubt, be\nreplying to some of the adverts appearing in FELIX, particularly the two\ninsurance companies'. A few years ago\nthere were some rogues in the business\nwho spoilt the show for the respectable\noperators. ICU has banned the leafletting of halls, and other measures\nhave weeded out the baddies. Furthermore, when you write to these companies\nyou are under no obligation\u2014you have\nonly asked for details. When answering\nany advert in FELIX it helps both us\nand the company to quote the paper's name.\nOur Plug\nThis illustrious, illustrative, and\nil luminous( cor!) newspaper would be\nhalf the size and twice as late but for\na dead ica ted( sic) band of volunteer\nstaff. FELIX tries very hard, but is\nnot a clique. Anyone, whether interested or not, be they an academic,\na secretary or a student-, is welcome\nto join us. Any degree of involvement\nis invited, from writing letters to\npasting up articles to collating after\nclosing time. After all, it's your\nnewspaper and if you want to help out\non it, great!

'Even the CCUs\nare given substantially greater\nsums from ICU to spend on\ntheir handbooks'. R CSU did in fact spend \u00a3800 on their\nhandbook this year, with the\nRoyal College of Science\nAssociation adding a further\n\u00a3400. Leeds University, who\nlike TC, produced 3,000 copies\nof their handbook, expect to\nsub sid is e it to the tune of\n\u00a34,000 a year.\nImpossible schedule\nCollege Publications Department agreed to the overtime provided that the Union\nguaranteed to reimburse them;\nPresident of the Union, Nick\nBrayshaw, agreed to this. In\neight days, Mr Morse turned in57 hours overtime to get the\nHandbook finished; as FELIX Editor Clive Dewey says: 'We had eight working days to\ncomplete the magazine, since\nby 2nd August FELIX had\nrecieved none of the Handbook\nartwork\u2014impossible without\nextensive overtime.'\nOn the nail, the Handbook\nwas delivered. One month later\nit was still in Registry waiting\nto be put into the mailing.\nJim Leach, in charge of the\nmailing at Registry, explains\nthe situation ; 'Normally\nI tell everyone to get items\nfor the mailing to me by mid\u2022CCCC'CCCC'C^ CC\nAugust. This gives me a Jwo\nweek leeway before we put the\nitems actually into the mailing.\nThis year I was on holiday\nuntil 13th September, so the\nmailing wasn't started until I returned.\nStunned\nNeither Mr White nor Mr\nDewey knew of this leeway.\nMr Dewey again:'/ was rather\nstunned to hear that all our\nwork had been for nothing. Even\none extra week would have\nmade all the difference. Moreover, I'm certain that it would\nhave enabled Paul to produce\na much better publication.\n'Obviously his working in\nHarrods didn't help matters,\nbut even so the overtime could\nhave been avoided if we at the\nFELIX unit had been better\ninformed by the Union. As it\nwas, this office was fully\nstretched on the Handbook, and\nwe relied implicitly on the\ninformation from Mr White.'\nIncompetance\nMr Ekpenyong takes a more\nacrimonious line: 'It shows\na marked degree of in com pet ance, on the part of the\nHonorary Secretary, that he was\nunable to give the correct\ncompletion date. This was\ndespite my protestations at\nthe time that Registry had\ngiven me a different final\ndelivery date. The Union\nExecutive has once again\nshown its low financial\npriority on Union publications \u2014\nexcept where things go wrong.'\n\n"

    "content": "8 - FELIX, OCTOBER4 th1976 Far too much emphasis has\nbeen placed on nuclear development and far too little on\nalternative technologies, says\nthe Royal Commission on\nEnvironmental Pollution, whose sixth report.'Nuclear\nPower and the Environment',\nwas published in mid-sep ember. The report was prepared under\nthe chairmanship of Sir Brian Flowers. As expected the Commission has warned the Government\nagainst nuclear expansion\nuntil the problems of disposal and containment of both solid and liquid-type wastes has\nbeen adequately solved. The\nuse of fuels, such as Plutonium\nis foolish, says the report,\nwhen no certain method of\neliminating environmental\npoisoning exists. Nuclear expansion, states\nthe report would imply the\nNuclear caution\nurged by Rector\nuse of fast-breeder reactors on\na large scale, and a 'plutonium\neconomy' in which this element\nwould provide a principal fuel\nfor energy supply. The development would also have potential\nimplications of another kind.\nWorld growth in nuclear power\nwould be likely to facilitate\nthe proliferation of nuclear\nweapons. There would be the\nrisk of terrorist action against\nnuclear installations using\nfissile materials, especially plutonium, as threats against\nsociety. Sir Brian has made\nclear before his opinion that\nthe question is not, whether\nterrorists might seize a nuclear\ninstallation or consignment of\nplutonium, but when. The\ntightening of present security\nmeasures is strongly urged.\nSo the Flowers report does\nnot see the need to expand\nnuclear power to the level of\na major energy producer in the\nnear future. Instead, it recommends res each into and the\nemployment of alternative\nmeans of energy production.\nThis, says the Commission, should be regulated by a new\nGovernment body set up\nspecifically with this objective.\nIf music be the food of love, why\ncan't rabbits sing? My article in the\nlast FELIX was entitled Practical\nRabbit, however, on taking psychiatric\nand legal advice (the Playboy Corporation\ndidn't like me using their rabbits!) I find\nthat my articles must henceforth be\ncalled White Lies, which couldn't be\nfurther from the truth...honest!\nPracticalities\nOnward ho to the practicalities. I see\nmy job as one in which I am here to\nassist you in whatever way I can;\nprimarily by ensuring that the Union,\nand all its integral parts, run smoothly\nand efficiently and ultimately by ensuring\nthat your best interests are always the\nprime consideration in any action taken\non your behalf. I look upon \"White Lies\" as an opportunity to give you practical\ninformation whilst also filling you in on\nwhat we're \"getting up to in the Union\nOffice\". If you think we should be\nconcentrating on one area as opposed to\nanother then please tell us.' cos Jimminy\nCricket may be an alternative to Capital\nRadio but even he runs out of new ideas\nsooner or later!!! Anyway...\nCrash Pad\nWith this year's unprecedented\nshortage of accommodation the Union\nhas felt it necessary to run a Crash Pad\nScheme. This scheme will ensure that\nnobody is denied a place to sleep or\nwash whilst they are seeking digs. If you\nare one of these unlucky homeless\npeople then come to the IC Union Office\nat 23.00 and we will provide you with a camp bed and washing facilities. There\nwill be a nominal charge of 10p per night\nand there will be a male and a female\ndormitory. Anyone wishing to assist this\nscheme please come and see me in the\nOffice (during daylight hours preferably!).\nFurthermore, IF YOU ARE PREPARED\nTO HAVE SOMEONE SLEEP ON YOUR\nFLOOR OVERNIGHT PLEASE CONTACT\nME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. MY\nINTERNAL TELEPHONE NUMBER IS\n2488.\nPanting\nParking Permit Application forms are\navailable from the Union Office. The\ncompleted forms must be returned by\n17.00 ON THURSDAY 7TH OCTOBER.\nAll applications will be considered by\nthe IC Union Parking Committee and a list of successful applicants will be\npublished in the FELIX of Friday 15th October. Please note that all applications\nare considered in the light of a set\nselection policy, the guidelines outlined\ntherein are firm and they will be adhered\nto strictly. As always I must remind you\nthat, once the scheme has commenced,\nTHE PARKING OF VEHICLES NOT\nDISPLAYING PARKING PERMITS IS\nPROHIBITED.\nWHITE\nLIES\nby John White\nIC Union Hon.Sec\nUnion Directory\nIn order to ensure strong lines ot\ncommunication between Union Officers,\nClubs' and Societies' Committee Members,\nUnion Members and College Admin, too\nthe Union produces a UNION DIRECTORY. This essentially consists of each\nse ct i on/g rou p/cI ub/ s oc ie ty/ commit tee\ngiving a list of their key members, their\npositions, their departments and years\nand an address and/or telephone number\nat which they may be contacted.\nThe Deadline For Copy For The\nDirectory Is 17.00 On Thursday 7th October. All copy received after this\ndate will not appear in the directory.\nI must inform everybody that the\nExecutive will be pursuing a policy of\n\" no name in the directory, no room\" when\ntaking bookings for all Union Rooms.\nPlease send all copy to the HON SEC. ICU. Elections\nWhat a wonderful year tor exam\nresults!?!\nI am currently acting - Hon Junior\nTreasurer,' Welfare Officer, VP ICU\n(Mines Presidents post), Student Residence\nOfficer, Overseas Students Committee\nChairman, Carnival Co-or d in at or, Mech\nEng Dep Rep and a few other positions\ntoo! If you would wish to become one of\nthese Officers for real then put your\nname up on a nomination paper in the\nUnion Lower Lounge (Council Notice\nBoard) and persuade some friends to\nsecond you;' no ugh said?\nAt a recent press confer-en ce, Sir Brian said that society\nshould be placed before the\nenergy race; he claimed that\nthe government tends to play\ndown the hazards of nuclear\ntechnology. A public airing of\nthe matter, he said, is urgently\nneeded.\nA completely different viewpoint is taken by the\nUnited Kingdom Atomic Energy\nAuthority, which accused the\nCommission of overplaying the\nenvironmental hazards. Britain, it says, is steadily being left\nbehind in the field of nuclear\npower. It asks that more atomic\npower stations be built immediately, and stresses the need\nfor nuclear power. It derides\nalternative sources as, at best,\nbeing capable of providing a minor portion of the nation's future energy needs.\nGestetner demos\nThe Union has recently bought some\nnew duplicators. The general use\nduplicators are situated in the Outer\nFelix Office, Union Archway. In order to\nbe able to use these duplicators you must\nattend a demonstration of their usage to\nbe held at 13.00 ON FRIDAY 8TH OCTOBER. Those present will be\nregistered as permitted to use the\nmachines and will be entitled to sign\nout the keys to the machines. Paper and\nink is available from the Union Office\nif reu ui red. Publicity rules OK\nPlease note that there is a\" Code of Practice\" which you are asked to\nadhere to when public ising anything on\nIC Union Notice Boards. A copy of these\nrules is available, on request, from\nmyself. Failure to comply with these\nrules may render the poster producers/\ndistributors liable to action by the ICU\nDiscipline Committee.\nIC Union General Meeting\nThere will be the first U GM of term\non Thursday (7th October) at 13.00 in\nthe Great Hall, Sherfield Building. The main item of business will be\nchanges to the Imperial College Union\nBy Laws. My own feelings on this\nsubject are that I would like to change\nthe By Laws into a form whereby the\nUnion is brought up to date and has a cleaner slate from which to progress.\nThe By Laws are included as an\ninsert in this FELIX. Look at them!\nThink about them!\nDo you not think that there should\nbe a facility whereby you can dismiss a Union Officer sabbatical or otherwise if\nhe is seen to be not performing his job?\nAt the moment you can't. Do you not\nthink that the Sabbatical Officers should\nhave a job description laid down tin which would be their responsibilities,\ntheir pay\", their holiday leave and so on?\nAt the moment there isn't. Do you not\nthink that aUG M should be able to\nmandate its officers to carry out the\nwishes of the Union Members? At the\nmoment you can't. These are just some of the issues involved. If you want to see your Union\nstraightened out and take part in this\nprocess of self-determination then please\ncome along\nMatters also to be discussed will include our motions to be submitted to\nthe NUS Conference.\nThat's all I 've got for now.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX, OCTOBER4 th1976 John (Chalky) White, Hon. Secretary.\nStrong, silent, intensely uncontroversial\nand self-styled Mr Nice Guy. A gluey\nsort of person and sometimes a stickler\nfor the rules, he should give a lot of\ncohesion to the Union All-Stars team\nthis year, by gum. A great passer of the\nball and a midfield dynamo to boot. One\nof the best centre-half s in the game, his\nshooting power might be suspect because\nhe wears p lim soles. Ambition: to dispel the myth that he is\njust a soap powder.\nChris Morrell, R CSU President: The Union's secret weapon; so secret that no\none really knows, not eve tt Chris herself.\nGiggles at random and thus is considered\nto have a large distraction potential on\nthe field. Would probably be sent off if\nshe tittered whilst a penalty was being\ntaken. Tipped for stardom next year\n(stir, stir).\nUsed to wear knickers.\nAmbition: to discover who \"ripped off\"\nher knickers in the first place and\nkindly donated them to the Union Bar.\nSteve Dearing, C& GU President: The Union All-Stars pet gorilla. Rumoured to\nhave difficulty in thinking and kicking the ball at the same time. Has a lot of\npotential, but is expected only to put in\nguest appearances due to excessive commitments with his home team.\nWears a wig.\nAmbition: to overcome his precarious\nposition's jinx and actually get an ACGI.\nA.N. Other, RSMU President: The Union\nteam's mystery player. Tragically due to\nbrain damage, Martin Levy the RSMU\nPresident-elect, has had to pull out of\nthe squad at the request of his home\nteam's board of directors. A great pity.\nHad planned to change the refreshment\nat half-time from oranges to afi rk in of\nbeer per man. Would have been the biggest\ndrunk in the league.\nWore a girdle once only.\nAmbition: to get back into Mines?\nSpectators\nLet us now make a quick perusal through\nthe likely spectators who will probably\nbe watching the matches with avid\ninterest.\nJen Hardy-Smith, President's Assistant. Refuses to take sides despite much\npleading from both camps. Brings on the\noranges at half-time and carries off the\nwounded when injuries occur. Tremendously\nskilled at nursing and reviving dead\nand dying e goes. Wears a tie every Friday.\nAmbition: to get home regularly from\nCouncil meetings before 10 pm.\nBrendan Clements, Union Bar Manager:\nSemi-bearded leprechaun from Dublin's fair city. Talks a lot, but would probably\nargue all night that he does not. Refuses to take sides despite much cajoling. Off\nthe field he is shy and retiring except at\nChem Eng Fresher s' Dinners. Removes\nhis left boot when losing at Cock a lee ky. Wears the same five ties ever week.\nAmbition: to retire one day and become\na professional Guiness drinker.\nClive Dewey, Editor of FELIX. Screams\nto take the field for the Union AllStars but so far without much success. An inconsistent header of the ball. Writes\ncolourful and sensational match reports in\nhis spare time when not shouting\nencouragement from the touch line. Believes in liaison whenever it is possible. Wears a FELIX T shirt.\nAmbition: to produce at least thirty-five\nmatch reports this year and hence set a new record.\nTed Fisher, former N UP E Secretary: Had apparently been under criticism from\ncertain dissatisfied sections of his own\nteam for allegedly and needlessly helping\nthe College AllStars. A veteran striker,\nhe rs an asset to every team that he is associated with.\nWears a parking warden's hat.\nAmbition: to get a new hut.\nr*I The Author: (Blush) Resident cynic. X Nobody's friend (sob). The most unpopular T* man in the league when this article has \u00a3\nbeen read (wail, sob). Promises not to\nwrite any more nasty, spiteful cont ro^C vers i al articles for FELIX despite their\njourn er lis sic eggs er lense( extended\nthroaty wail,s obj i Is reputedly open to\nbribes however.\nWears armour plating from now on.\nAmbition: to prevent just one person in\nhis department from identifying him as\nthe author of this load of drivel.\ni So there it is: the crowds have returned\nand the two teams are coming out of the\ndressing rooms just raring to go. A point\nworth noting is that although both the\nteams are on the pitch waiting for the 4c kick-off, some members may try to deny C all knowledge of playing football or T* even cricket. In the event of this happening J humour them politely.\nW.M.(a nag). "
