Photo Credit: Vroom Vroom Recordings\nof his record last year,a collaboration\nbetween SOPHIE and Charli\nXCX had been circulating around\nthe internet for a while.It combined\nCharli XCX\u2019s familiar voice with\nthe sugar coated production of\nSOPHIE, creating something truly\nfuturistic.\nThis collaboration, \u2018Vroom\nVroom\u2019, would end up being the\nname of Charli XCX\u2019s new label,\nVroom Vroom Recordings. She\ndescribes it as label where the artists\nwill be \u201csharp, potent and deadly\u201d.\nThe first release on the label, an EP\nalso called VroomVroom,was released\nlast week \u2013 produced by SOPHIE\nand with a guest appearance from\nPC Music\u2019s Hannah Diamond.\nStarting off full throttle, the EP\u2019s\nnamesake sees Charli XCX imitate\na car. She sings \u201cBeep Beep\u201d and\n\u201cVroom Vroom\u201d mixed with the\nreal sounds of an automotive. And\non the chorus she\u2019s fully aware of\nher pole position in the race to the\ntop of pop: \u201cBitches know they can\u2019t\ncatch me\u201d. The song is a confident,\nand energetic statement of new\nlifestyle, having recently moved to\nL.A.\n\u2018Paradise\u2019 begins on a chipmunk-ified chorus, with ethereal tones\nreflecting the core lyric: \u201cTonight,\nwe\u2019re in paradise\u201d. It soon skitters\ninto more experimental beats,\nwith the pops and squeaks which\nCharli XCX\u2019s Vroom Vroom Recordings aims to leave a mark on the pop music world\nthunderous and explosive, with the\nchant \u201cThrow it up\u201d encouraging\nclub goers.\nThe ballad-like closer, \u2018Secret\u2019, is\nthe EP\u2019s biggest surprise. It\u2019s snappy\nand trappy, with a cheeky \u201cShh\u201d\nemphasising it\u2019s obvious theme.\nMany have called PC Music\nhyper-consumerist pop, self-aware in its commercial appeal.\nVroom Vroom is the first sign of the\ncollective transcending this label;\nCharli XCX adds substance and\nmeaning to their winning electropop formula.\nPC Music are branching out and\nassimilating. Charli XCX is savvy\nof the true future of pop; her next\nalbum, also produced by SOPHIE,\ncould be her biggest hit yet.\nVroom Vroom is out now on Vroom\nVroom Recordings.\nPC Music rule the world. Photo Credit: Hannah Diamond and SOPHIE\nSharp,\npotent\nand\ndeadly\nlabel, might have had a single that\nmade it onto BBC Radio 1\u2019s\u2018A-List\u2019,\nbut he\u2019s failed to capitalise on this\nsuccess. Similarly, SOPHIE\u2019s\ncompilation album, Product, which\nwas released last year seemed like\na bit of a flop, considering that its\nrelease also coincided with the\nlaunch of a sex toy.\nThe collective have now started\nto look towards mainstream pop to\nfind their success. Before the debut\nShe\u2019s fully\naware of\nher pole\nposition in\nthe race to\nthe top of\npop\ngirls \u2018round the world, now we in\ncontrol,\u201d and there\u2019s clear aspiration\nto be like Marilyn Monroe: \u201cTake\nthe crown, shut it down, \u2018bout to\nsteal the show / Shooting star,\nI\u2019m a boss\u201d (a reference to the\nbook Shooting Star: Marilyn\nMonroe).

I\u2019d like to use these\nskills to make a kick-ass sabbatical\nofficer, and get to know each and\nevery one of the 340+ clubs and\nsocieties. As a year rep for 2 years,\nI\u2019ve sat on numerous meetings to\npush for what the student body\nwants.I\u2019ve held committee positions\nin philosophy society, AMSA and\nothers and been a finalist in the\nVenture Catalyst Challenge.\nI\u2019m beyond passionate about\nhelping you get the most out of our\nsocieties. To many of us, societies\nare what makes uni fun. They\ngive us a chance to explore new\nexperiences, make new friends and\ngive us something to look forward to\namongst all the exams, projects and\ndeadlines. As your officer it\u2019d be a\nprivilege to help you enjoy your time\nas much as I have mine, and work\nhard to #makegoodthingshappen.\nAs DPCS, I\u2019d like to provide the\nfollowing;\n- Weekly afternoon drop-in sessions\nat Charing Cross Campus for\nstudents that live in this area.\n- Create a monthly open forum for\nclubs and societies to raise issues\nany issues.\n- Help volunteering societies\nexpand and collaborate with other\nuniversities.\n- Make it easier for societies to\nsupport each other and co-host\nevents for a stronger, cohesive\nstudent body.\n- Start sponsorship training for\nsocieties.\nJames Cox\nI\nwant to improve the\ncommunication between\nSport Imperial and the union,\nand to increase funding for\nclubs and societies.\nThe allocation to C&S through\nbudgeting has increased by ~10%\nfrom \u00a3307,000 in 2011 to \u00a3332,000\nin 2015, whereas participation\nincreased by ~40% from 18,000 in\nto 25,000 total memberships in this\ntime; this is clearly not proportional.\nI would like to be able to allocate\nincreased funding to clubs and\nsocieties with the aim to increase\nparticipation all across Imperial.\nThis is important as they provide an\nJonathan Zheng\nH\ni, I'm Jonny.\nAs the founder of the\nnew Magic Society at\nImperial, I know what\nit's like to start up a society, and I\nwant to make the process better.\nI'll do this by keeping new clubs in\nthe loop through meeting each one\nface to face, and giving them more\nupdates on the progress of their\napplications.\nI've also played hockey over my\n4 years here, and sport at Imperial\nhas seen its fair share of 'bad\nbehaviour' in public, losing clubs a\nlot of time and money. I'm going to\nmake the process for resolving these\nproblems clearer, by having an open\ndoor policy to provide advice and\nguidance through the issues that\ninevitably arise.\nFinally, I'm going to make sure\nthat the people in charge of clubs\nknow that they can count on me\nto keep them up to date with the\ninformation they need. The big\nproblem I've seen in my experience\nwith the union has been the lack of\na reliable source of help, for those\nwho come across problems when\nrunning their clubs. I aim to be that\nsource, in order to keep the stress\nand frustration when working with\nthe union to a minimum.\nexcellent way to make friends and\na much-desired break from work,\ncontributing to overall wellbeing\nand personal development.\nThere is room for improvement\nin the communication between\nSport Imperial and the union. A\njoint strategy is currently being\ndeveloped, the successful execution\nof which would be a vital task for\nthe incoming DPCS. Our sports\nclubs are student-run, therefore it\nis important to me to ensure that\nstudents are heavily consulted in\nthis process.\nHaving been the Vice President of\nClubs & Societies for the RSMU, I\nhave a good understanding of how\nto oversee clubs and to help them\nwhere necessary; I understand\nthat most clubs are very happy to\nrun themselves. I organised The\nBottle Match, the second oldest\nrugby varsity in the world played\nbetween the Royal School of Mines\nand Camborne School of Mines;\nthrough this I learnt how to create a\ncompromise to appease staff higher-up whilst maintaining the interests\nof the students.\nDavid Moores\nFELIX Editor\nI\n'm Lef. Some of you may\nknow me from back in my\nundergrad days as a young,\nstarry eyed biologist. I'm back\nin college now,slightly disillusioned,\na science communication MSc\nstudent editing the science section\nfor FELIX on the side.\nDeciding to run for FELIX editor\nwas not easy.From what I've seen,\nit's a hard and thankless job.Yet it is\ncrucial that it's done well and based\non my past experience as LeoSoc\npresident, I'm confident I'm cut out\nfor the task.\nAt Imperial, the diversity\ncharacterizing our\ncommunity,whether that's\ndisciplinary, or political, or sexual\nor what may you, is often forgotten,\nburied under the silence that results\nfrom our lack of communication.\nWhich is why as FELIX Editor,\nI would do my best to encourage\nmore students to use FELIX as\na platform for expressing their\nthoughts and opinions. Through\noutreach initiatives and workshops\nI aim at embracing new ideas\nand believe I can increase student\ninvolvement,while fostering a much\nneeded dialogue.\nI would also continue the\ndevelopment of the paper's\nonline platform and social media\npresence and try to use it to\ngenerate additional income through\nadvertising.This should increase the\nvolume and independence of the\nstudent voice and protect it against\nany attacks.\nI want FELIX to be the paper\nwe deserve. A paper that offers\ndevelopment opportunities to\nstudents and one that challenges its\nreaders. A paper truly representative\nof the student community.\nLef Apostolakis\nCale Tilford\nF\nELIX needs an\nindependent, experienced,\nand forward-thinking\neditor; someone to keep it\nfree from Union interference, make\nit relevant to students, and lead it\ninto the future \u2013 that person is me.\nI\u2019ve worked tirelessly as both\nMusic and Games Editor to deliver\nquality, innovative content, writing\nover 50 articles this year alone. As\neditor of Imperial\u2019s forthcoming\ngaming magazine, Another Castle,\nI\u2019ve had the opportunity to design\nand organise a publication from\nscratch.\nWhile FELIX has a large physical\npresence on campus, its digital\nM\ny name is David.\nI would (clearly)\nlike to be the editor of\nFELIX.\nI need your help.\nIf enough of you vote for me, I can\nbecome editor of FELIX.\nThis means we will be able to do\nmany good things.\nThese good things include:\nInvestigative student journalism\nNon-investigative student\njournalism\nBigger, better, unbelievably good\nhangman section\nDrunk acquaintance of the week\nMore puzzles\nCrosswords you can actually solve\nDank memes page\nPaul Balaji weekly column\nWe need more Imperial specific\ncoverage.

In 2014, they\nfound an equal gender ratio of\nstudents at the GCSE level, but\ngirls outperformed boys in almost\nevery single STEM subject. At the\nA-levels, the gender ratio begins\nits skewed trajectory with fewer\nfemale students, although they still\ncontinue to outperform boys.\nIn further education, numbers\nof women are currently increasing\nin apprenticeships, vocational\nqualifications, and academia, but\ngender ratios still lag behind. These\nalso vary greatly by field, with\nratios of women as low as 2.6%\nin qualifications for construction,\nplanning, and built materials.\nAt the level of employment, the\nnumbers still show the same trend,\nwith less than 13% of workers in\nSTEM fields being women. So\nit should be no surprise that by\nthe time women are in a position\nto become members of the Royal\nSociety, the ratio is skewed at just\n6%.\nThese numbers are telling of an\ninverted pyramid with numerous\nglass ceilings for women progressing\nthrough the course of an academic\ncareer. If we all start out equal, it\u2019s\nmore than worth a ponder as to why\nwomen are not progressing as far\nand as often up the STEM career\nladder as men.\nNAOMI STEWART\nO\nrangutans from a\ncompletely distinct\nsubspecies have been\naccidentally introduced\nto another wild population, a\nrecent genetic study has found. The\npopulation in question is situated\nin Camp Leakey in Tanjung\nPutjing National Park, within the\nIndonesian portion of Borneo\n(Central Kalimantan).\nAs their natural habitats are\ncontinually destroyed by human\ninterference, increasingly orangutans are being displaced, with\nless space available for them to\nbe released back into. There are\ncurrently two species of orangutan\nlocated in Borneo and Sumatra.\nVia genetic sampling and 44 years\nof Camp Leakey data, it was found\nthat two females reintroduced\ninto the park in the 1970s were\nactually translocated from a\ndifferent subspecies usually found\nin a separate part of the island. This\nisolation means that they have been\nkept genetically distinct for around\n176,000 years.Sudden interbreeding\ncould now have serious unforeseen\nconsequences. To date, these\nfemales have produced around 22\nhybridized descendants.\nIn the past, hybridizations have\nhad positive or negative effects on\nexisting animal populations. In\nsome species, the cocktail of genes\ncan lead to an effect of \u2018hybrid\nvigour\u2019, where good qualities from\neach parent combine, leading\nto offspring of increased fitness.\nHowever, the opposite may\noccur in the form of \u2018outbreeding\nDid you know...\nThere are two orangutan species\nof which the Bornean is divided\ninto three subspecies\nOrangutans spend more time in\nthe trees than any other great ape\nThe orangutan\u2019s orange colour\nallows them to blend better into\nthe surrounding swamps that tend\nto be muddy orange due to peat\nThe orangutan is one of the\nmost intelligent primates, using\nsophisticated tools to construct\nsleeping nests\ndepression\u2019, resulting in crosses\nbeing at a disadvantage compared to\npurebreds, usually because they are\nless well adapted to the surrounding\nenvironments. And in primates\nwith differing behaviourial traits,\nthat may decrease mating success.\nSo what has been the consequence\nfor the Camp Leakey orangutan\npopulation?\nThe two females in question ,\nSiswoyo and Rani, were rescued\nfrom the pet trade having originally\nbeen captured from the North West\npart of the island.Rani has interbred\nprolifically with local individuals,\nproducing one of the largest families\nin the park with 14 descendants\nover three generations. Could this\nbe hybrid vigour in action? At the\nother end of the scale, Siswoyo has\nmuch fewer, unhealthier offspring\nthan any other female in the park.\nAfter two offspring dying in infancy\nand after contracting a followup infection, Siswoyo died ten\ndays after her last birth. The only\ndaughter Siswoyo produced has\nsince had a stillborn offspring, a\ndaughter that died in infancy and a\nson that regularly requires medical\ntreatment. Could this be a tragic\nexample of outbreeding depression?\nAs such, this mixture of results for a\npopulation that is very much at risk\nhas got scientists worried about the\nfate of Camp Leakey orang-utans.\n\u201cThere is no definitive evidence of\noutbreeding depression\u201d,says Banes,\none of the main scientists in charge\nof collecting the genetic samples,\n\u201cbut our findings are enough\nto cause serious alarm.\u201d At the\nmoment, not much is known about\nhow stable the future is for this\npopulation, however with constant\nhabitat destruction, hybridization\nmay be a necessity in order to allow\nthe species survival.Many,including\nthe scientists in charge of the\nstudy, are strongly opposed to this\nidea, and uphold the international\nconservation guidelines. These\nstate genetic testing should be done\nprior to reintroduction to avoid\ninterbreeding that could effectively\ndecrease population fitness, and\nlead to higher rates of extinction. A\npartingquotefromBanesperspective\non hybridization; \u201corangutans\nfrom different populations haven\u2019t\nshared a common ancestor for\ntens of thousands of years. For the\nsake of short-term welfare, we\u2019ve\ncompromised the viability of wild\npopulations \u2013 we can never take that\nback\u201d.\nThreats to these wild populations\ninclude poaching, habitat\ndestruction and the illegal pet trade.\nBut at the top of the list lies the\nproduction of uncertified palm oil\nin Southeast Asia, which is used to\nmanufacture a variety of food and\ncosmetic products. So in the future,\ntry to look for as RSPO or Green\npalm label that indicates the palm\noil is sustainably sourced.\nCrosses are\nless locally\nadapted\nto the\nprevailing\necosystem,\nleading to\ndecrease\nof mating\nsuccess\nWhat lies ahead for the futrue of this little one?

The sun\nwas, finally, seen after about 100km\nand, energised by a sweltering 3o\nC,\na chain gang was formed through\nthe French countryside. Suddenly\nfinding ourselves just 40km outside\nof Paris, entering Poissy, we stopped\nfor a final food, toilet and caffeine\nstop and were ready for the final\npush.

Fast and Furious\nis simply a very fun, enjoyable set\nof action films, and \u2013 of course \u2013\nthey feature some great car chases.\nHowever, my opinion that Tokyo\nDrift is the best one is apparently\nsome sort of cardinal sin\u2026 let\u2019s see\nif my friends can agree with me on\nthis list at least:\nBlues Brothers (1980)\nThere\u2019s actually several big car\nchases in this 80s classic. The two\nthat really stand out to me are when\nthe brothers completely destroy\nDixie Square Mall and, of course,\nthe ending.No film since has packed\nso much comedy and carnage into\nsuch short periods of time. Fun fact\n\u2013 a record (at the time) 103 cars we\ndestroyed in the making of this film.\nThe Raid 2 (2014)\nHey guys, have you heard that I\nlike The Raid films?!? I think I may\nhave mentioned the series a few\nhundred times in this column alone.\nIn all seriousness though, any list\nof the best car chases that doesn\u2019t\ninclude the incredible highway fight\nscene in The Raid 2 is just objectively\ninaccurate. I would also recommend\nwatching the horrifically convoluted\nmaking-of for this incredible scene.\nLupin III: The Castle of\nCagliostro (1979)\nHey guys, did you hear that I like\nMiyazakai films too?!? Oh, right,\nsorry. At least here I have some big-name back up for my love: Steven\nSpielberg has famously described\nthe opening car chase of animated\nclassic The Castle of Cagliostro \u201cone\nof the greatest chase sequence ever\nfilmed\u201d. The jazzy soundtrack here\nis also a perfect remix of the classic\ntheme to the 70s TV show Lupin\nIII.\nBEN COLLIER\nDispatches from the Oscars\nDocumentary corner: Dear Zachary\nBen Collier\nWriter\nB\nefore I begin this review,\nI\u2019m going to really\nstrongly recommend that\nif you haven\u2019t already seen\nthe film you should avoid reviews\nor summaries online. Should you\nwatch this documentary \u2013 as I\ndid \u2013 with no foreknowledge then\nI guarantee that watching Dear\nZachary: A Letter to a Son about his\nFather will be a genuinely unique\nexperience. Director Kurt Kuenne\nhas a very important message to get\nacross here, and the structure of the\nfilm \u2013 the way it progresses, slowly\ngiving you drips of information \u2013 is\nessential to its effectiveness.\nTo give a very simple synopsis\nof the film, it was made (as per its\nnamesake) as a memorial to the life\nof Andrew Bagby, a good childhood\nfriend of the director. He was\nmurdered by his girlfriend, Shirley\nJane, after ending their tumultuous\nrelationship of several months.\nThe recipient of this letter is the\ncouple\u2019s son, Zachary, born shortly\nafter Shirley\u2019s arrest.The film is split\nbetween documenting the murder\ncase and speaking directly to\nZachary, telling him about the kind\nof man his father was. The level of\nlove and care that went into this film\nis apparent, as is the love Kuenne,\nand the dozens of friends and\nfamily members interviewed had for\nAndrew. This cinematic scrapbook\nshowcases Andrew\u2019s personality,\nhis likes and dislikes, and the effect\nthat he had on so many people\u2019s\nlives. Much like the ending of It\u2019s a\nWonderful Life, certain parts of this\nfilm are life-affirming, highlighting\nall the positive effects a single man\ncan have on so many people.\nDear Zachary is really an\nexperience above all else. I honestly\ncannot remember the last time I was\nso viscerally affected by a film. And\nfor this reason, despite it being one\nof my new favourite documentaries,\nI doubt I\u2019ll ever watch it again. A\nfull range of emotions are elicited\nthrough the viewing experience,\nand anyone who gives it a watch\ncan expect to be angered, amused,\ndepressed, sickened, and everything\nelse in-between. No other film\nhas conveyed the impact of losing\nsomeone in such an emotionally\nintelligent and accurate way.\nHowever, despite all the dark\nmoments, the lasting feeling most\npeople will experience is one of\nhope and inspiration \u2013 at seeing the\ndignity and love shown by Andrew\u2019s\nparents throughout.\nThe film masterfully avoids\nthe pitfall of slipping into overly\nsentimental territory. There\u2019s\nsentimentality, for sure, but\nnothing is forced. The charmingly\namateurish way everything is\nshot and edited, along with the\nbackstory of why the director is\ncompleting this project, just adds to\nthe appeal. Overall, Dear Zachary is\na very human documentary and one\nI cannot recommend enough; its\ncontents are incredibly important,\nand I would consider it a disservice\nto yourself not to give it a watch.\nDirector Kurt Kuenne (left), at the graduation of friend Andrew Bagby, the subject of the film.

Photo Credit: AP\nT\nhe Academy Awards\ntook place last Sunday\nevening, and your\nintrepid FELIX team\nstayed up until the early hours of\nMonday morning keeping track\nof the ceremony on an illegal live-stream, significant portions of\nwhich were dubbed into Turkish.\nTruly, there is nothing we will not\ndo for journalism. As usual, there\nwere victories, surprises, snubs, and\nquestionable jokes, and that was\nonly in the office\u2026\nThe biggest story of the night was\nthe success of Mad Max: Fury Road,\nwho swept up awards for six of its ten\nnominations. The awards may have\nall been for technical achievement \u2013\nSound Editing/Mixing, Costumes,\nMake-up & Hairstyling, Editing,\nand Production Design \u2013 and\nGeorge Miller may have missed\nout on the Best Director prize.\nNevertheless, the evening showed\nthat big-budget action spectacles\ncan have more of an impact then\nperhaps previously thought.\nAnd, of course, after Mad Max\nclaimed all those prizes, there was\nlittle left for The Revenant, who\nmanaged to win three Oscars,\ndespite being nominated for 12.\nSure, Leo won his Best Actor award\n(is it right to put \u2018finally\u2019? This may\nhave been his fifth nomination, but\nI think you\u2019d be hard pressed to\nname a year where he was actually\n\u2018robbed\u2019 of the award), Alejandro\nI\u00f1arritu collected his Best Director\ntrophy the second year running, and\nEmmanuel Lubezki was awarded\nBest Cinematography for the third\nyear in a row. But The Revenant\nentered the ceremony as the\nfrontrunner, and failed to clear up.\nMost notably, The Revenant failed\nto win Best Picture, an award\nwhich went, in possibly one of the\nbiggest surprises of the night, to\ninvestigative drama Spotlight \u2013 also\nwinner of Best Original Screenplay.\nWriting in The Guardian, Alicia\nShepard said the win for Spotlight,\nwhich focuses on the Boston Globe\u2019s\nuncovering of the Catholic sex\nscandal, \u201ccan expose to a whole new\ngeneration why journalism matters\u201d.\nThat\u2019s us here at FELIX. We\u2019re\njournalism.\nIn a charged speech, producer\nMichael Sugar said that the\nmessage of the film should \u201cresonate\nall the way to the Vatican\u201d, issuing a\ndirect challenge to Pope Francis to\n\u201cprotect the children and restore the\nfaith\u201d.\nSpotlight\u2019s win for Best Picture\nwasn\u2019t the only surprise of the night.\nMark Rylance won Best Supporting\nActor, which was widely expected\nto go to Sylvester Stallone, for his\nrole as Rudolf Abel in Bridge of\nSpies \u2013 the film\u2019s only award. Best\nVisual Effects went to Ex Machina,\nthe British sci-fi drama whose\nbudget was minuscule compared to\nits competitors; Ex Machina beat\nout stiff competition for the award,\nincluding Star Wars, Mad Max, and\nThe Revenant,whose CGI bear scene\ngarnered acclaim. Alicia Vikander,\nthe star of Ex Machina, also took\nhome Best Supporting Actress for\nher role in The Danish Girl.\nEnnio Morricone took home the\nBest Score award for his treatment\nof Quentin Tarantino\u2019s The Hateful\nEight. Going up to receive the\naward, the 87-year-old Morricone\nwas treated to a standing ovation, a\nrecognition of his decades of work\nin the industry. Inside Out took\nhome the award for Best Animated\nFeature, as expected, and British\ndocumentary Amy,following the life\nof the late singer Amy Winehouse,\ntook home Best Documentary.\nSugar\u2019s speech on the Catholic\nChurch wasn\u2019t the only pointed\nstatement of the night; in fact,\nnearly all winners had something\nto say about the state of the world.\nDiCaprio used his time to address\nclimate change, calling it \u201cthe most\nurgent threat facing our species\u201d;\nBest Adapted Screenplay winner\nAdam McKay, who won for The\nBig Short, told the audience \u201cif\nyou don\u2019t want big money to\ncontrol government, don\u2019t vote for\ncandidates who take money from\nbig banks\u201d (a thinly-veiled attack\non Hillary Clinton, who made $3\nmillion from 12 speeches to big\nbanks in 2013-15); and even Best\nCostume winner, Jenny Bevan, said\nthat we might be heading towards a\nMad Max world if \u201cwe\u2019re not kinder\nto each other\u201d. Such an innocuous\nmessage didn\u2019t stop a whole row\nof celebrities from giving her the\nstink-eye as she strolled down the\naisle to collect the award, decked\nout in a bejewelled leather jacket\nand scarf, giving the sartorial finger\nto any notions of what women\n\u2018should\u2019 wear at awards.\nBut all this was overshadowed\nby host Chris Rock, who used his\nplatform as host to point out the\nracial inequality of Hollywood. If\nyou\u2019ve ever wondered what a room\nfull of white people unsure whether\nto clap or not sounds like, just give\nhis opening monologue a watch.\nThere were some aspects of his\nhosting that did work well, such as\nthe segment where he interviewed\nblack cinema-goers in Compton,\nnone of whom had heard of Bridge\nof Spies. It pointed out the glaring\ndisconnect between what the public\nactually watch, and what gets\nnominated, as well as highlighting\nthe disappointment at the lack of\nnods for Straight Outta Compton.\nElsewhere, his jokes left a sour taste\nin the mouth, like when he quipped\nthat in the past African-Americans\nwere too busy getting \u201craped and\nlynched\u201d to protest about diversity,\nor when he said Jada Pinkett-Smith\nboycotting the ceremony was like\n\u201cme boycotting Rihanna\u2019s panties \u2013 I\nwasn\u2019t invited\u201d.And then there were\nsome that left us totally stumped,\nlike his introduction of Stacey\nDash as director of the \u2018minority\noutreach programme\u2019, who came on\nand wished the bemused audience a\nhappy black history month.\nSinger and \u2018musician\u2019 Sam Smith\nalso tried to get in on the social-justice act when collecting his award\nfor Best Original Song for \u2018Writing\non the Wall\u2019, dedicating his\naward to the LGBT+ community.\nUnfortunately, he also tried to claim\nthat he was the first openly gay\nman to win an Oscar (there have\nactually been, at my count, at least\nten Oscars going to gay men).To be\nfair, he prefaced this with the claim\nthat the fact no other gay man had\nwon an Oscar \u201c[might not] be the\ncase\u201d, showing us all that ignorance\nshould never get in the way of\nsaying what you want to say. When\ncorrected of his mistake, he simply\npresumed he was the second gay\nman to win an Oscar.Someone then\npointed out Howard Ashman had\nwon two Oscars for Best Original\nSong, to which Smith quipped \u201cI\nshould know him. We should date\u201d.\nAshman died in 1991 from AIDSrelated complications. Smith has\nsince quit Twitter, and will \u2013 no\ndoubt \u2013 claim that he is the first gay\nman to do so.\nFRED FYLES\nChris\nRock\u2019s\nintroduction\nof Stacey\nDash left\nus all totally\nstumped\nStacey Dash (right) confused all of us, not least of all Chrissy Teigen.

Without an\nappropriate guarantor, landlords see\nfit to demand rent in batches of six\nmonths as well as a huge deposit.\nThe vast amount of money that\nthis adds up to has to be paid upfront\nin one go,otherwise the unfortunate\nstudent will have nowhere to stay.\nThis is completely unacceptable,\nparticularly in the turbulent London\nhousing market, where costs add up\nto incomprehensible amounts.\nWithout a UK guarantor, and\nalready paying huge fees, many\ninternational students end up taking\nout loans to afford the ridiculous\ncost of having a roof over their head.\nImperial is the most international\nuniversity in the UK; surely we\nshould be catering to this need more\nthan anyone else.\nBut that is not the case \u2013 other\nuniversities such as SOAS and UCL\nhave successfully implemented\nschemes where the university\nacts as a rent guarantor for any\nstudent in need. The system works\nby the university acting as a UK\nguarantor for the student,taking the\nuncertainty and risk away from the\nlandlord.Therefore students can pay\nrent one month at a time, the way\nit should be. This is clearly a system\nthat works and relives so much\nstress for so many students. Why\nthen has it not been implemented\nhere at Imperial?\nThis is not a new issue, this is an\nongoing problem. Many students\nhave expressed concern over the\ninaction of College and their\nnegligence. In an increasingly\nerratic world, where college life is\ngetting more stressful and tougher,\nit is the College\u2019s responsibility\nto ensure life for students is as\neasy and stress-free as possible\nwithout the already stressful year\nof exams and coursework. Finding\naccommodation should be simple\nand financially possible, not a wild\ngamble and a stab in the dark.\nTessa Davey\nComment Editor\nY\near on year, students put\nthemselves forward as\ncandidates for leadership\npositions in the Union\nbecause they feel strongly that\nthings need to change, and they\nthink that their ideas and their\ndrive can help implement that.They\ncampaign, putting their faces and\nideas out there, and, in the case of\nthe sabbatical officers, some earn\nthemselves a job at the end of it.But\nis this fair?\nWe want the people in charge\nof running the Union to be the\nbest possible people for the job,\nbut we never question whether the\nmethod of electing them is really\nachieving that. For some roles, it\nmight be the case that the most\noutgoing and personable person,\nwho is most willing to neglect their\ndegree for a fortnight to campaign,\nis the best person for the job. But\nfor other roles, do we miss out on\nthe candidates who might perform\nbest in the role because we\u2019re too\ndistracted by the bells, whistles\nand pretty people? Do we vote for\ncandidates because they fit our view\nof what a responsible person looks\nlike? Do we keep people out of\nroles because we have a fixed idea\nof who would be appropriate in that\nposition?\nI understand that a huge part\nof getting a job is being able to\npresent yourself well. But in the\n\u201creal world\u201d, job applications are\ngender-blind, sometimes name-blind, and certainly don\u2019t involve\nhaving the faces of the candidate\nplastered all over the workplace of\nthe interviewers for two weeks. For\nany other job, candidates would be\njudged on their ideas, experience,\nand qualifications (which would be\nsomewhat verified), instead of how\nmany friends they have to vote for\nthem, and how much people like\nlooking at them during lecture\nshout-outs.\nImperial students aren\u2019t engaged\nenough in Union politics \u2013 the\ninner workings of which are opaque\nat best \u2013 to read the manifesto of\nevery candidate, or to know what\ncampaign promises are achievable or\nrealistic. All the average student has\nto go on is how trustworthy their\nfaces are,and how convincingly they\ncan lie.\nIf we want our student union to\ntruly represent us and to be run by\nthe best candidates, we owe it to\nourselves to consider the capabilities\nof each and every candidate, and\nlook beyond who is most charming.\nThe elections are a popularity contest\nIt\u2019s the university equivalent of a beauty paegant\nThe beautiful people.

Debate next week\nFor the first time in 40 years, we will choose whether or not to remain in the\nEuropean Union. Following the referendum announcement by the Prime Minister,\nthe deciding date is set for the 23 June 2016.\nThere are nearly two and a half million students in the UK who could play a decisive\nrole in this referendum debate.\nTo explore these crucial issues for students Universities UK is hosting a major\nnational event, a Question Time style debate on Tuesday 8th March in partnership\nwith the National Union of Students titled \u2018Should students care about the EU?\u2019 The event, which will feature speakers from both sides of the debate,\nwill take place in at The Church House, Westminster, London from 19:45-21:00. The event will be chaired by Javier Espinoza, Education Editor, Daily\nTelegraph. It\u2019s free to attend, but booking is necessary. For more information and to book, go to:\nimperialcollegeunion.org/eu-referendum\nMany of us have had issues with poor quality housing or rogue landlords\n(or both if you\u2019ve been really unlucky!), and it is time to put that to an end.\nAs part of the Union\u2019s campaign to tackle housing issues, we are thrilled\nto be collaborating with Move\u2019m!\nMove\u2019m is essentially a TripAdvisor for student housing. Similar to how\nyou would rate a hotel or restaurant, you can now rate your student\nhouses too. You can review and advise on properties that you loved and properties that you hated. Other students at Imperial are then able to benefit\nfrom this inside knowledge, by knowing which properties are pleasant to live in and which should be avoided.\nIn the past Move\u2019m has been able to pre-warn students due to move in to a negatively reviewed house and has even got them out of their contract\nand got their non-refundable money back. It has also put pressure on landlords local to other Universities to ensure houses are of the best quality.\nTo kick things off we would like as many of you as possible to review accommodation you\u2019ve lived in within the past 5 years. As a reward, after\nreviewing your property (and confirming your Imperial email address) you will be sent a \u00a35 e-voucher for Amazon! Go to the Move\u2019m website and\nsubmit your review easily via: www.movem.co.uk/listing-submit\nFridays in the h-bar - bar food on till 22:00 from 4 March\nFrom Friday 4 March, the h-bar will be extending its bar food service until 22:00. Grab an h-bar burger for\nyourself or tapas to share with friends and colleagues with your drink for a little bit longer!\nComing soon at the h-bar:\nPub Quiz - every second and fourth Thursday\nWine Tasting, Friday 4 March\nPGI Friday, every Friday from 16:00\nimperialcollegeunion.org/h-bar\nGrab yourself a \u00a35 Amazon Voucher courtesy of move\u2019m\n\n"

In fact,\nlast year alone, three out of four\nstudents reported problems with\nmental health at Imperial. It's\ntherefore vital that we constantly\nstrive to improve the welfare system\nat ICU and in the college.\nI started my PhD at Imperial in\n2012, and over the last four years\nhave been a society President, a\ngraduate teaching assistant, and\nsubwarden at Beit Hall.

Through\nmy own personal challenges with\ndepression I\u2019ve had the opportunity\nto experience both sides and the\nimpact of the efforts of previous\nDPWs. My insights have given\nme the drive and resilience needed\nto make further improvements to\ncreate a more positive and fulfilling\nImperial experience. I believe that\nthe breadth of issues that we all\nface can be addressed through the\nfollowing initiatives:\nTimetabling affects every student\n\u2013 I propose:\n- Departmental consultations\nwith year reps, mental health\nrepresentatives, the DPE and\nDPW when planning the spread of\ndeadlines and exams.\n- Stress-less days aligned with\ndepartmental peak periods.\nReducing stress-levels improves\nmental health but better support\nacross the College is imperative.We\nneed:\n- An anonymous counselling\napp for immediate help from\ncounsellors, the DPW and Union\nrepresentatives\n- Obligatory mental health\ntraining given equal footing as first\naid across staff, starting with senior\nand personal tutors.\n- Support sessions for all students\nwho are directly or indirectly\naffected by mental health issues.\n- Hold Personal Tutors\naccountable through SOLEinspired reviews.\nConsent:\n- Raising awareness around\nconsent.\n- Improving sexual assault support\nand communication.\nStudent housing:\n- Building on work by the previous\nDPW to open the option of using\nImperial as a guarantor on rental\ncontracts\n- Lobby the University for\naffordable accommodation closer to\nCollege, reversing current trends.\nFunding:\n- Create better awareness of all the\nfunding resources and issues among\nstudents, especially for medics.\nFind out details at www.\ndenholmdott.co.uk and on my\nFacebook page.#DenholmCanDoIt\n\n"

But to fully realise\npermanent change and truly\nimprove our student experience we\ncannot lose momentum. We must\nlook beyond the next year.\n\u2022 It\u2019s unacceptable that luck\nwill continue to determine which\nstudents are supported in times of\ndifficulty and which are not.\n\u2022 The cost of your world\nclass degree can no longer be your\nmental health.\n\u2022 I want to pick up exactly\nwhere previous officers have left off,\nensuring progress does not slow.\nWe are at a crossroads and must\nmaintainpressureonCollegetofulfil\ntheir commitments to improving\nour wellbeing.This is more than just\nwelfare; it is about education, clubs,\nsocieties and the services that we\noffer - it encompasses everything\nwe do.\nA year as ICSMSU Treasurer,\nthree years as a Union bar manager\nand four years in the Faculty of\nMedicine has made it clear the\nproblems here are firmly entrenched\nand change is no swift process.\nI have committed to making no\npromises I cannot keep. But if you\nwant a President who:\n\u2022 has the experience to hit\nthe ground running as the Union\nembarks on its next three-year\nstrategy\n\u2022 prioritises long term\nchange for lasting benefit over\nshort-term and short-lived\n\u2022 has a real vision for what\nthis university could one day be\nthen vote for John.\nLet\u2019s not reinvent the wheel. Let\u2019s\ndo what we\u2019re already doing, but\ndo it better. Let\u2019s finish what we\u2019ve\nstarted.\nJohn Golden\nRaven Connelly Beng Hung\nH\ni everyone! I\u2019m a\nsecond year life science\nstudents.\nOkay. I\u2019m not gonna\nwaste your precious time here\ngiving you sweets talk like what or\nhow I will make your university life\nbetter. But, instead of just typing,\nI\u2019m gonna show by action.\nAs far as a true candidate is\nconcerned,the ability of promoting/\nmarketing a product has reigned\nsupreme. It is often said that a true\nleader is a leader who has impeccable\npersuasion and convincing skills.So,\nthis manifesto will be a platform for\nme to test my promoting abilities.\nHere, I will demonstrate that by\npromoting Uber and Giffgaff\nsimcard.\n\u201cUber is my life, I can\u2019t live\nwithout Uber\u201d. This is the common\nphrase we heard among university\nstudents, especially late-night-having-fun-students when the\ntube stations are closed. For anyone\nwho doesn\u2019t know what Uber is,\nit is technically a \u201ctaxi\u201d that you\ncan order by downloading an app\nthrough your phone. Freshers,\n\u201cUber\u201d app is a must thing in your\nphone after your tinder.\nhttps://www.uber.com/invite/\nimperialpromotionoue\nSecondly, in the era of\nglobalization in telecommunication,\neveryone knows SIM card is a must\nfor life. But how do we choose a\ngood and cheap telecommunication\nprovider? I\u2019ve simplified them for\nyou. For international students\nespecially, giffgaff simcard is yours.\nGreat location coverage services in\nLondon, cheapest phone calls rate,\nunlimited Internet and tethering.\nBasically, with Giffgaff, you can\u2019t go\nwrong.\nhttps://www.giffgaff.com/orders/\naffiliate/ravenconnelly\nEasily, I have equipped you with\ntwo most important surviving tools\nin University.Thank you very much.\nMelody Ball\nI\n\u2019m Melody Ball, a Taiwanese/\nEnglish, Beit Hall senior\nstudying in the final year\nfor Biomedical science with\na strong artistic flair and passion\nfor change. I have worked closely\nwith the Union through multiple\nsocieties and voluntary roles.\nI believe I am the best voice to lead\nthe organisation that represents us.I\nwant to make your time at Imperial\nCollege London as valuable as\npossible. To achieve this I have 3\nmain objectives:\n1. Satisfaction\n2. Support\n3. Ambience\nTo improve satisfaction:\n- Promote \u2018find a sponsor\u2019 event\nfor projects, societies, and clubs:\nensuring informed choices and\nsuccessful funding.\n\u2013 Increase \u2018skills\u2019 workshops\nto enhance opportunities for\nstudents to gain well-rounded\nexperience outside academics.\n\u2013 Greater efficiency and\nfluidity for communication\nbetween different faculties, student\nrepresentatives via multiple\ncommunication tools\nTo improve support:\n\u2013 Enhance quality of\npotential references such as personal\ntutors by using staff that are rated\nwell on student feedback forms\n\u2013 Greater awareness and\npublicity for services and tools\navailable such as Imperial Plus\nscheme and Student consultation\nframeworks.\n\u2013 Increase ease of \u2018house\nhunting\u2019 by organising information\nstalls with student-led advice and\nrecommendations\nTo improve ambience:\n\u2013 Promote more cultural\nevents other than Imperial\u2019s annual\n\u2018Celebration of Culture\u2019 evening.\n\u2013 Strengthen student\ncommunities by enhancing intra-faculty \u2018Mum & Dad\u2019 schemes via\norganised set timetables dedicated\nto it.\n\u2013 Strengthen student\ncommunities by promoting inter-faculty schemes such as Althea\nImperial programme and social\nevents such as Artfest Exhibition.\nLevel up with Melody for\nPresident. See votemelody.org for\nmore details.\nCat Stuttard\nM\ny name is Cat\nStuttard, a third\nyear geologist here\nat Imperial. I want\nto inspire real, positive changes for\nyou, as Union President, convince\nyou that I can help to improve the\nwellbeing and happiness of students.\nI want to give you something\nmeaningful, tangible and achievable\nand I want students to believe that\nthe union is working for them. An\nImperial study of more than 1000\nstudents indicated 70% of you are\nstressed on a weekly basis,and many\nare suffering far worse. This is not\nacceptable!\n\u2022I want the college to prioritise\nstudents\u2019 mental wellbeing. Too\nmany of us suffer stress.\n\u2022Develop training of personal tutors\nto help and improve the student\nexperience.\n\u2022Students should feel engaged with\nthe union body; understand what it\ncan do for them. I want to engage\nyou with schemes like the \u2018Seat with\na Sabb\u2019campaign, the Sabbs coming\nto you directly on campus!\n\u2022I want to improve co-ordination\nand communication between the\nClubs, Societies and Projects, with\nthe Union and Sport Imperial so\nless goes wrong. We can do better.\n\u2022Peer support schemes encouraged\nand elder student mentor schemes\ndeveloped, so that we can all help\neach other.\n\u2022Develop the Graduate Student\nUnion (GSU), proactively consult\npostgraduates and make initial\nsteps to improving the postgraduate\nexperience and their representation.\nEmails don\u2019t cut it.\n\u2022Reconsider options for rent\ndecrease of first year halls.\n\u2022Direct updates on what the union\nis doing for you. Students need to\nsee the wins.\nPatryk Fryzlewicz\nPRIVATISE THE UNION\nOur Union has never truly been\nthe property of the students. It\nhas instead been the property\nof unashamed \u2018CV-Padders\u2019,\nthe vagabonds prolonging their\n\u2018university experience\u2019at our cost, or\nthe power-hungry careerists.\nThe students\u2019 money has been\nwasted on failed events and\ncampaigns by this staggering\nbureaucracy. The future of our\nUnion is a \u00a37 million question.\nMy solution: PRIVATISE THE\nUNION. Each Imperial Student,\nfor the duration of studies, will\nbe given a share in the Union;\nand receive dividends from the\nprofits. The Union will become a\nproductive organisation, driven by\nthe right motives of creating value\nfor students and representatives\npaid based on performance.\nAt the heart of this idea is a\nsimple yet effective restructuring of\ngovernance. Several other proposals\nstem from this privatisation:\n1. Free Speech at University. The\nnon-interventionist policy will\nensure freedom of expression,\ntreating students as the adults that\nthey are.\n2.Individual Responsibility.In cases\nof conflict, the club\u2019s representatives\nshould find appropriate solutions.\nThere is no such thing as group\nresponsibility, and it follows that\ngroup bans are wrong.\n3. No More Agitation. We will be\nin the business of creating value for\nstudents in the form of dividends,\nnot in the business of propaganda\n\u2018campaigns\u2019 on the students\u2019 dime.\nMake your vote work for you and\nnot for someone else\u2019s CV. Vote for\na Union which, rather than losing\nmoney, makes money for you.\nVote for Patryk Fryzlewicz.

Vote\nAlex Chippy Compton\nfor ICSMSU President\nand maybe I\u2019ll stop\nspamming you with yet another\ncampaign\u2026\nWe face a time of challenge. We\nneed passionate and experienced\nleadership to sustain ICSMSU's\nunique identity and build a strong\nfoundation for the future of our\nunion. My wide-ranging work on\nthe SU and a variety of committees\nand representation of ICSM, both\ninternally and externally, has given\nme the crucial skills and knowledge\nneeded for this job.\n\u2022 I have begun discussions with\nother medical schools and key\nICSM faculty members which\nhave opened valuable channels\nfor academic development. I will\nbuild on these to explore how we\ncan engage all of you in curriculum\ndevelopment and to support the\nimplementation of Sofia, the new\ncurriculum map, for you.\n\u2022 I will strengthen our Welfare\nCommittee so it can deliver effective\nassistance wherever needed,\nincluding providing targeted help to\ninternational students and a more\nactive response to LGBT+ and\ndiversity concerns.\n\u2022 I will review our events calendar to\nincorporate your feedback into what\nwe currently do and explore hosting\nnew, exciting events like Mum's &\nDad's ice skating and an ICSM\nouting to Thorpe Park.\n\u2022 I have in-depth knowledge of all\nour clubs and societies from my\nroles as SU Treasurer and Clubs &\nSocieties Officer. I will use this to\nhelp maintain their traditions while\nwidening student participation and\ninvolvement.\nVisit http://chippyforpresident.\nstrikingly.com to read more about\nme and my plans for ICSMSU.\nMoving forward together to build\na stronger ICSMSU.\nI\nCSM has a thriving\ncommunity, one which I want\nto promote and improve.\nTogether, we can achieve our\npotential and set a precedent for\nthe future. We pride ourselves on\nthe diversity of services we provide,\ninternally, and more recently,\nexternally. However, we are now\nmore aware of our identity in recent\ntimes. I think I have had a lot of\nexperience to see what ICSM can\nbecome in the future. I love ICSM\nand I want us to fulfil and exceed\nour potential. we need a focused\nPresident to facilitate this well and\ndirect what we can do together to\nachieve this.\nMy core vision focuses on\ncommunity and identity. Broadly, I\naim to:\n- Continue current work (e.g.\nJunior Doctor contracts, housing)\n- Improve our relationship with\nCollege and ICU\n- Identify other issues via open-door meetings and open forum\ndiscussions\n- Promote what we, as a\ncommunity, do\n- Advertise the outcomes of\nmeetings and welcome feedback on\nthem\n- Oversee the development of the\nnew Reynolds Bar\n- Continue work on the\nCurriculum Review\n- Work to improve Sofia\n- Dedicated open-door policy\n- Promote awareness of issues\nsuch as funding and mental health\n- Plan for the future.Maintain our\nidentity in the face of adversity\n- Facilitate the running of our\nclubs and societies to ensure they\nthrive\nTogether, we can make ICSM\ngreat.Thanks for reading.\nPlease visit my website/Facebook\nevent for more information.\nUsama Asif\nCouncil Chair\nAbigail de Bruin\nL\nastyearasDeputyPresident\n(Clubs&Societies) I sat on\nboth Council and Trustee\nBoard. I therefore have\nrelevant experience for Council\nChair where the role provides a vital\nchannel of information between the\ntwo.\nEnsuring all members of Council\nunderstand the relevance of their\nrole on the board from the very\nbeginning will hopefully tackle\nsome of the issues with quoracy\ncurrently faced. I feel my broad\nexperience training officers could\nbe used effectively to hold training\nsessions for the Ordinary Members,\nLiberation officers and other subsets\nof roles on Council alongside\nrelevant staff from the Union.\nOne of the most important\nfunctions of Council Chair is to pass\ninformation back and forth between\nCouncil and Trustee Board. Having\nsat on both boards previously I\nknow how to summarise the issues\ndiscussed and pass on key points\nto relevant audiences rapidly and\nsuccinctly.\nAs Council Chair, particularly\nwhen it comes to difficult meetings,\nit is important that the loudest voice\nin the room is not the only one\nheard, and also that the discussion\nis not allowed to loop back on itself.\nThis is a skill I built as DPCS last\nyear.\nCouncil Chair empowers students\nto discuss issues that they care about\nwith the highest levels of the Union.\nI would work with students to ensure\ntheir papers are polished ready\nfor discussion and ensure they are\ncomfortable and prepared to present\nto the sometimes intimidating\nmembership of Council.\nStephen Ball\nC\nouncil meetings are the\nchance for your voice to\nbe heard throughout the\nyear and to shape the\nUnion into what you want it to be.\nAs someone that has been going\nalong to Council meetings for four\nyears, I have seen Council make big\ndecisions and also get stuck arguing\nin circles.\nIn my role this year as Recreational\nClubs Committee Chair, which has\na position on Council, I know first\nhand how much Council can make\na dramatic influence on lives of\nstudents and the crucial role that the\nChair has on making this happen.\nAs part of this role, I have been\npushing to ensure that the Union\nmakes its work available to you,\nallowing you and your clubs to be\ninformed about what the Union is\ndoing and where it is planning on\ngoing. I will continue to enable your\nvoice and opinions to shape the\nUnion and its future.\nAs Council Chair I would act to\nmake Council a body that effectively\nrepresents you and that the new\nOfficer Trustees hear your opinions\non the matters that are important to\nyou.\nI would also work to bring the\nactivities of the Trustee Board to\nwider consideration to ensure that\nthe whole Union is able to have\nvaluable input into their work and\nthe long-term planning of the\nUnion.This will help ensure that the\nUnion continues to represent and\nsupport you in the best way it can\nthroughout your time at Imperial.\nMichael Edwards\nUnion Council is one of those\nlittle known and heeded necessities\nof running a Students Union that\nhas so much to offer. It brings\ntogether student reps from across\nthe College, many of whom you\nare currently electing, to weigh in\non how the Union should focus its\ntime and efforts to best meet your\nneeds as students of a world-class\ninstitution.\nI\u2019ll admit, I'm no constitutional\nnerd like some of my Council\ncolleagues, but I can learn. As\nCouncil Chair, I want to make\nUnion Council a more visible and\ninteresting body that acts to hold\nnext year\u2019s officers and sabbaticals\nto account.\nI'm sitting on the Council this\nyear as an Ordinary Member for the\nFaculty of Natural Sciences and have\ngained a working understanding of\nthe Council and feel that I can step\nup to manage and lead the Council\nin its duties next year. During my\ntime at Imperial, I've also been\nan academic representative in the\nChemistry Department, meaning I\nhave the experience in representing\nstudents.\nI\u2019ll aim to address the challenge of\nlowturnoutforcouncilbyconsulting\nvoting members further in advance\nto ensure effective meetings, and\nopening more motions to email\nvotes to ensure the important\nbusiness of Council can occur even\nwhen we cannot physically meet.\nSound good? Vote for me; you\ncan't go wrong!\n\n"

Eight universities\nfrom London (recently down from\nnine; some people just can\u2019t take\nthe heat) have to develop a play\nfrom scratch: writing, rehearsing,\nrewriting and then rehearsing some\nmore. They then battle it out in\nsuitably dramatic fashion for the\nprestige and rewards associated with\nwinning. Oh, and put on a good\nshow.\nOur submission this year is\ncalled N.E.E.T. (Not in Education,\nEmployment or Training), and tells\nthetaleofprotagonistNate\u2019sarrested\ndevelopment proceeding the death\nof his mother, with imaginary\ncharacters & antisocial behaviour in\ntow.

Despite the abject\npoverty and squalor amongst the\nmud, something of a self made\ncommunity is emerging. Along\nthe main street running through\nthe camp, hairdressers, restaurants,\nschools, churches and mosques have\nAgainstaseaoftroubles\u2013theatreintheJungle\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nThe Good Chance Theatre is aiming to offer escapism to refugees across the camp\nsprung up; born out of a necessity or\na hope to carry on as usual despite\nthe horrific situations the residents\nfind themselves in. A theatre has\nalso been set up by the British\nplaywrights Joe Murphy and Joe\nRobertson, supported by the Young\nVic and The Royal Court theatres\nand many celebrated figures in\nBritish theatre including Tony\naward winning director Stephen\nDaldry, and artistic director of The\nRoyal Court, Vicky Featherstone.\nThe Good Chance Theatre, which\nderives its name from the common\ndebate amongst the refugees of the\nlikelihood of crossing The Channel\nto Britain on a particular day,was set\nup to become a place where refugees\nfrom all the different countries\ncome together to tell their stories.\nUnder the geodesic plastic dome of\nthe theatre,a daily of roster of events\nis put on by volunteer artists. These\ninclude music lessons, dance and\nacting workshops, English lessons,\nand even workshops in specific arts\nas varied as circus or clowning. The\nGood Chance website declares they\nhave hosted \u201cpoetry slams, stand up\ncomedy nights, acoustic sets, theatre\nperformance, rap battle\u201d, providing\nescape from the rest of the camp\u2019s\ndreariness.\nThe space has become especially\nimportant for the women and\nThe Globe to Globe tour perform Hamlet at the Jungle camp in Calais. Photo Credit:The Guardian\nDespite\nthe abject\npoverty and\nsqualor in\nthe mud, a\nself made\ncommunity\nis emerging\nchildren living in the Jungle.\nWomen are outnumbered one to\nten within the camp and do not\nstray outside of their family tents for\nfear of becoming targets of sexual\nviolence. Likewise, the camp is a\ndangerous place for the hundreds\nof unaccompanied minors who\nhave found their way to Calais but\nhave become separated from their\nfamily.These most vulnerable of the\nrefugees find it difficult to make use\nof the paltry resources available, for\nthey are seldom able to leave the\nsafe spaces. they have created for\nthemselves.\nFor this reason, many of the\nvisiting artists have made it their\nmission to draw the women and\nchildren out of their constant fear\nand give them an outlet to express\nthemselves. Recently, Afsaneh Gray,\na playwright associated with The\nGate theatre in Notting Hill, ran\na workshop encouraging the young\nrefugees to draw scenes from stories\ntold to them in their childhood. In\nhis powerful essay about Calais in\nThe Guardian,Christopher Haydon\ndescribes some of the drawings by\nthe young children, many featuring\nthe emblems of the war that has\nbeen ongoing in their native Middle\nEast for their entire lives; guns,\nChinook helicopters, the threat of\nISIS.\nThe images, so far removed from\nthe childhood these kids should\u2019ve\nhad indicates the burden of mental\nhealth problems in this population.\nMost, if not all of the residents\nof the Jungle are suffering from\nthe mental effects of brutal and\nclose encounters with violence and\nwar. In most cases, the refugees\nare not receiving adequate medical\ncare for physical ailments, let alone\nsupport for mental health. The\nGood Chance Theatre and similar\ninitiatives may be one of the most\neffective ways of tackling the issue.\nArt therapy has been shown to be\neffective in tackling post traumatic\nstress disorder in returning\nsoldiers, ameliorating aggressive\nand depressive tendencies. It is\nonly reasonable to assume that the\ncivilians fleeing from those war\nzones would benefit from the same\ntherapies.\nNot everyone has been convinced\nabout the value of the Good Chance\nTheatre however. In particular, the\nperformance of Hamlet by the\ntouring \u2018Globe to Globe\u2019arm of The\nGlobe theatre became a lightning\nrod for controversy.\nCritics argue that the residents of\nthe Jungle camp are living in fear\nfor their lives, often going without\nfood, sharing one toilet between\n75 people, completely without\nwashing facilities; a theatre has\nno place in such an environment.\nDo they have a point? Should\nwe be talking about food for the\nsoul when there is a shortage of\nfood for their bellies? Some might\nconsider the idea of performing\ncenturies old theatre to people in\nsuch destitute circumstances to\nbe very definition of leftist ivory\ntower thinking; a peculiar brand\nof champagne socialism (\u201clet them\nwatch Shakespeare\u201d). In Elliot\nEisner\u2019s words such people view the\narts \u201cas nice but not necessary\u2019\u201d.\nYet, it is clear that to the 300\nrefugees who watched the outdoor\nperformance, it was a welcome\nbreak from the monotony of life in\nthe Jungle. One refugee, speaking to\nThe Guardian, said, \u201cI\u2019ve read the\nplay in a book but never seen it... It\nis good to see theatre, \u2026 It is good\nto enjoy something\u201d.\nThroughout history, in times of\ndespair, people have sought refuge\nand comfort in the arts.\nWhy else is Verdi performed\nto packed out audiences in the\nDonetsk Opera House as shellfire\nechoes around them? Why else, in\nthe midst of the darkest days of the\nFirstWorldWar, did British soldiers\nstart publishing and distributing\npoems and satire on the front lines\nin the \u2018Wipers Times\u2019? Indeed, why\nelse did our earliest ancestors start\nscrawling bison on the walls of\nSpanish caves when by rights they\nshould have been more concerned\nwith the woolly mammoths after\nthem?\nThe idea that the arts are a luxury\nis a myth that should be readily and\nswiftly dispelled. The arts should\nnot be sequestered away in gilted\ngalleries, privy only to the privileged\nfew. The arts more often than not\nJoe Murphy and Joe Robertson, the founders of The Good Chance Theatre.

Theoretically the residents,\nnow twice displaced, should be\nrehoused in other parts of the\ncity, but for many \u2013 especially the\n500 unaccompanied minors \u2013 the\nsituation remains precarious\nIt is a striking indictment of\nEuropean politics that the people\nwho have gone to extraordinary\nlengths to flee violence and terror\nfrom their own countries find\nthemselves on the shores of one of\nthe richest countries in the world\nstill fearing for their security.\nDespite all odds, in face of\nEuropeangovernmentsthatoscillate\nbetween barely acknowledging the\nplight of the refugees and openly\ndenying their right to seek refuge,\nthe men, women and children who\nhave found their way to Calais are\nstarting to rebuild their lives, but\nthey need our help.\nAs with most things, governments\nare far behind the mentality of\nthe citizens, but it is time that\nthe powers-that-be in Europe\nrecognise the displaced people, not\nas \u201ca bunch of migrants\u201d as David\nCameron so charmingly termed\nthem, but as human beings, just\nlike us, deserving of shelter, food,\nwarmth, and yes, even beauty.\nFind out more about donating or\nvolunteering at goodchance.org.uk\nShould we\nthinking\nabout\nculture\nwhen\npeople are\nstarving?\n\n"

For all its imagination,\nsci-fi is certainly a genre that recycles\nold concepts.The intrigue lies in the\nexecution and the re-imagining of\nthem.We\u2019ve certainly seen plenty of\nrobots wreaking havoc on humanity,\nbut the show finds a way to bring\nsomething different to a very\nfamiliar conflict.\nHumans features a world just like\nours, with the exception that it\u2019s\na world filled with robots, called\nsynths, who look just like humans.\nThe synths are part of the society,\nperforming menial jobs like manual\nlabour, looking after the elderly,\nand even working as prostitutes.\nAmongst these mindless robots,\nthere\u2019s a small group who have\nemotions and can think for\nthemselves. Naturally, this group is\non the run from people who seek to\nstop them (or help them?) and they\ninadvertently get split up.\nThe series mostly centres on these\nrobots trying to find each other,\nwhile at the same time, trying to\ndeal with the circumstances they\nfind themselves in. In addition,\nthere are also human characters\ncentral to the plot. These include,\nbut are not limited to, the Hawking\nfamily who buy one of the synths,\nreprogrammed, a retired old\ninventor and a police officer who\ndislikes synths with vengeance.\ntachycardiac pace that keeps you\non the edge of your seat. The show\nis written so that it\u2019s not really\npossible to divide the characters\ninto good or bad. There\u2019s a more\ncomplicated, more realistic, and\nfrankly more interesting morality to\nHumans, where everyone is acting\naround the moral grey areas. The\nwriters are able to nail the real-life\nworries and emotional connections\nthat come when synths are a part of\neveryday life.\nThe show also addresses, but\ndoesn\u2019t directly answer, questions\nrelating to having robots in our\neveryday life. When machines can\ndo all the things you can do, then\nwhat\u2019s the point of us? What\u2019s\nthe purpose in our lives? The teen\ncharacter Mattie helps to convey\nthis well; she believes education\nis pointless because eventually the\nsynths will develop to be faster,\nbetter and cheaper than us. The\nshow also talks about what it means\nto be a human and actually live. Are\nemotions inherently a part of us, or\ncan they be taught and developed?\nIn one brilliant scene, the synth\nAnita says to Laura, the mother of\nOne of the amazing characteristics\nof Humans is that the premise\nisn\u2019t really such a big leap or\nadvancement. AI is being developed\nand robots are being modified\nas you\u2019re reading this. Whether\nthe robots will be as pretty as\nGemma Chan as Anita (who\u2019s very\nconvincing as a semi-humanoid)\nremains to be seen. Humans takes\nplace sometime around now, not in\na technologically advanced future.\nIt\u2019s a sci-fi show for the non sci-fi\nfan; sci-fi that has a foot in sci-fact.\nThis show is a clever, well\nwritten and high-energy thriller.\nIt has a breathless urgency and a\nher, while the mother and teenage\ndaughter are suspicious and curious.\nGemma Chan is great as the synth\nAnita, conveying a smoothly-robotic nature with \u2018human\u2019qualities\nthrough a compelling and alluring\nperformance.\nAnother standout actor is William\nHurt, as Dr. George Millican, an\nengineer on the original synth\nproject and owner of Odi (Will\nTudor), an out-of-date model\nthat the government is looking to\nrecycle. But George can\u2019t bear to\npart with Odi because he\u2019s come to\nfeel like family and all the memories\nthey share. Hurt imbues George\nwith a sense of loneliness and regret;\nhe doesn\u2019t like the idea of upgrades\ndestroying the connections that\nfamilies have to their synths. He\nalso brings humor to the role as\nhe suffers through his new, no-nonsense model, Vera, who strictly\nmonitors his health.\nBy bringing these kinds of\nemotional touches into the episodes,\nVincent and Brackley succeed in\nmaking Humans, well, very human\n\u2013 concerning itself not only with\nthe humanity of the real people we\nmeet, but with the humanity of the\nsynthetic ones, too. With a plot full\nof twists and surprises and dazzling\nperformances all around, Humans\nis an amazing and beautifully made\nshow. It deserves more attention\nthan it currently has and is worth a\nwatch.\nHumans is available on Channel 4\nand Amazon Prime\nthe family,that she can look after her\nchildren better than her because she\ndoes not get tired, angry or forget\nthings; however, unlike Laura, she\ncannot love.\nSpeaking of the acting, all the\nactors are able to deliver engaging\nand impressive performances.\nWith the Hawking family, we see\neach person react in different and\nbelievable ways to the new synth.\nThe youngest daughter idolizes her,\nthe teenage son feels attracted to\nThe show\nfinds a way\nto bring\nintrigue to a\nvery familiar\nconflict\nWhen\nmachines\ncan do all the\nthings you\ncan do, then\nwhat\u2019s the\npoint of us?\nA large number of Human and Robot characters fill the screen.

So far however, long\nrange and high manoeuvrability are\nmutually exclusive. A collaboration\nof Imperial with Southampton,\nis developing a MAV prototype\nwith bat-inspired wings. The\nwings use polymers situated in the\nmembranes, stiffening and relaxing\nin response to the electrical current\nrunning through them. According\nto Dr Rafael Palacios, from the\ndepartment of Aeronautics at\nImperial, \u2018\u2018The MAVs will be able\nto travel longer distances in tighter\nspaces with high controllability,\njust like a bat\u2019\u2019 making them and\ntheir production more economical.\nThe aim is to get the bat-inspired\ntechnology to fly a distance of 30\nor 40 miles. However this requires\na lot more work as they will need a\nbattery or chemical device. In the\nfuture these MAVs could rival the\n10 mile range of Amazon drones.\nA\nt Sh!t Sc!ence, we argue\nthat all research, no\nmatter how outrageously\nridiculous-sounding, has\na purpose and contributes to widen\nour knowledge of the world. Even\nwhen it is a study of how fish can be\nleft-handed.\nWell\u2026 not left-handed, per se.\nIt turns out that a specific type of\nfish called the scale-eating cichlid\nhas a mouth that is angled a couple\ndegrees. For half these cichlids , the\nmouth tilts to their left and the for\nthe other half, it tilts to their right.\nThis particular species could be\nconsidered rather foul, leaching off\nlarger fish and ripping off scales\nfrom their sides as they obliviously\nswim. And since this phenomenon\nwas first described in 1993, it was\nthought that the way their mouth\nis slanted determines which side of\nthe fish the cichlid will prey on. So\nwe were pretty sure that we knew\nwhy, but we weren\u2019t really sure that\nwe were sure.\nAh... the scale eating cichlid Perissodus microlepis... lurking about, ready to\nattack its next vivtim Photo Credit Wikimedia\nMARIANNE GUENOT\nSh!t Sc!ence\nScientists left hanging over left handed fish conundrum\nThat is, not until researchers\nfrom Toyama University\u2019s\nGraduate School of Medicine and\nPharmaceutical Sciences captured\n200 of these fish and ripped them\nopen (they deserve it, let\u2019s be\nhonest). Surprisingly, by analysing\nthe stomach contents of young and\nadult scale-eating cichlids, it turned\nout that even though the young fish\nhave slanted mouths, they eat scales\nfrom both sides of their prey, and it\nis only later that they start to attack\nthe fish from the side their mouths\nlean, when they become more\nefficient at preying.This tells us that\nthe fish learn how to take advantage\nof their physiognomy. And this\nfinding makes this curious piece of\nresearch important to the field of\nlaterality.\nLet me explain. As humans, we\nlove symmetry, and a symmetrical\nface is a mark of attractiveness.\nHowever, our bodies are profoundly\nasymmetrical. Researchers are very\ninterested in laterality, i.e. why\nhumans and other animals use\none side of their body more\nthan the other.\nMost humans are right-handed, and it turns out we\nare mostly right-sided as well,\nwe will prefer to use our right\nfoot, our right eye, our right\near\u2026 Why is this laterality\nso strongly ingrained in our\nbiology? It is thought that in\nour species, Homo sapiens, our\nstrong laterality is a result of the\nliteral laterality of our brains,\nour centre for language residing\nin our left hemisphere, perhaps\nencouraging us to use our right\nhand. But we still don\u2019t know\nwhether laterality is genetic or\nacquired. Studies such as this\none, showing an example of\nbehavioural laterality, where\nthe phenomenon is acquired\nthrough learning, give us\nbetter insights into our own\ndevelopment.\n\n"
