It is to the fresher s, though, that we must look for new blood, so fresher s, whatever your squash\nstandard, even if you have never played before, there may easily be a pla oe in one of the teams\nfor you this Beason or before you leave oo lle ge. Finally, we wish all squash players an enjoyable season.\nThe club officers this year are: Captain: I.G. MaoBean (Rm. 14 Old Hostel) Hon. Sec:K. R. Gray (Rm. 23 Old Hostel) RIFLE CLUB\nRifle Club's Suo ces s_ in National Competition I.C. Rifle Club wrote a new page in its history of over50 years by scoring in June\nof this year its first success in a national comp etti tion. The \"A\" team won \u2022Jhrough the six rounds\nof section B of the Maokworth-Praed Competition, taking by a wide margin all mato he s but the first. Mattis hall and District Home Guard\nwere the first opponents, and were beaten by only two points when the urgency of the Inter University League was at its height. Later I.C. equalled its own record score of790 ex 800, and was always within three points of the record. The team of eight was\nchosen from the following, all of whom shot\natleast once : I.M. Abbott, H.G. Cope ,\nR.W. Good ley( Captain), D.G.B. Home,D. Hughes , S. P.O.J as singer, P.A.Le min, J.R. Ryder, R.F. Seaborne , M.R. Sharps. All are to be congratulated oa a fine display of sustained good shooting. \u2022\nROWING\nThis is' one of I.C.'s strongest sports, not fewer than eight VII I's being, entered in the Tideway Head of t ne River Raoe, although results for1954 were slightly down over the\nprevious year. The first VIII were eighth, beating for the second year running the U.L. or ew! This result was confirmed when I.e. won\nthe U.L. Rowing Cup.\nI.C. crews were up and down the river all summer, culminating in the appearance at Henley; here t ne first VIII maintained its reputation as a crew to be reckoned with. We hope to include a report on Henley in our next issue. SWIMMING Alt no ugh not one of the more heavily supported sports within the College, the I.C. team of eight won an equal share in the U.L. Swimming Cup last year. This was essentially a team performance because only two places were gained in the individual events; the nucleus of Manley, Stewart, Lampard, Roy and\nMo.Chesney bringing I.C. up by wins in the Medley and Freestyle Relays. The final result was a triple tie, and was the first time I. C.had been in the first pla oe in this event. GAMES TRIALS WILL BE HELD AT HARLINGTON ON \u2022\nWEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY, 6TH&9 TH OCTOBER.\nWATCH THE NOTICE BOARDS FOR DETAILS I!I ATHLETICS\nDue to the shortness of the season, and to the fact that many members of the club were\nin the U.L. team, I.C. were not often at full strength for fixtures, except the U.L. Champions hips, in wh i oh we were 3 rd. Nevertheless, there were many good performances. Trevor Bailey, the most outstanding middle distance runner I.C.h as ever had, last year set up\nnew records for all dist a noes between \u00a7 mile and 3 miles! M.Ri ok ard, H.P in sent and J.B. Davies, continued to improve.\nThe R.C.S. won the I.C. sports in the last event, the Relay, when Guilds were disqualified. The prospects for the o lub next summer are good, sino e many of last season's performers are still with us. ICWSC\nFor the uninitiated this abbreviation stands for Imperial College Womens' SportsClub. The doings of I. G.W.A. on the sports field deserve publicity because nearly every member seems to do something or other. Not least of last year's highlights were the mixed Netball matches on the Tennis courts. These were held in the lunch hour and probably had more spectators than any other I.C. sporting activity. Teams of I.C. f.S.C. performed with varying sucess es at Netball, Table tennis. Mixed Badminton and Tennis. For any game requiring a team of11 I. C.W. A. has always realised its limitations, sino e the total membership is only about 4 0 . ( exo ep t Hookey)\nAt the U.L. Athletics Championships the S her wood Cup was carried off by I.C. W.S.C., mainly through the all round ability of four mem-ber s,J. Find later, M. Mawes, D. Goodway, and F. Clarke.... RUGGER\nOnce again the U.L. Rugby Cup has come\nsafely back to I.e., showing that the o lub is the strongest, as well as being the\nlargest, in the University. Last season\nwas one of the best ever for I.C., and the\nplaying strength was reflected, in the fact that six XV's were often fielded. In addition to the normal fixtures, two full size tours were undertaken, to Holland at Christmas, and to Paris at Easter. The\nmato he s played on these tours were won, but the mere winning of matches does not make ,\nfor successful tours. The exploits of the\nteam at other pastimes on these tours are\nremembered with affectionate amazement; I.C. Rugger men on tour need no excuse to let their hair down.\nThe playing strength in the team is so\ndeep that, although several of the senior players have left, the overall standard should not suffer, and the College expects that the U.L. Cup will become a fixture in its show-case.\nIN MEMORIAM \u2014\nWe mourn the passing of our Sports Editor who has succumbed, but not gone under\n( Coxes of1 st, VII I's never go under), to his PartI Exams.\nWithout a guiding hand on the s tee ring ropes these two Sports Pages are very in complete, for wh i oh we ap polo g is e. We hope\nto include further reports in the next issue. Club Secretaries, who are interested, are asked to get in touch with the Editor through\nthe rack.

    "content": "2 FELIX PROFILE M.j. NEALE: This year's President is one of the few\ni, ste,r&i us te8 with an external degree who manage to tax ea full and active part in the life of -:.eV:i iJ W. Mike, who i a27, had a brief education at St..Edward's School, Oxford, bef ore becoming apprenticed to Rolls Royce.\nTi.ere ne was put on the development of fuel ir.jeo-.ion pumps and the flight testing of aero-engines. In niB spare time he acquired a first class degree at Derby Tech. and a Whitworm Scnolaranip wh i oh brought him to I.C. in1 S45, ostensibly to do research. AS an K.t. Pundit he rap xd ly passed to the\ncaptaincy of the Guilds Motor Club and drove\n3o in the 1950 Old Crock's Race. The taste for Plying acquired with Rolls Royce resulted in ii is association with the gliding club. Despite a preference for tinkering with the\nmechanical rather than the aircraft aide, he\nbecame captain of I.C. Sliding Club in1951 and flew in the British National Competitions\nin1953 tie was also a member of the British_ Team in the World Sliding Championships at Madrid In1952 and again at Great Huoklow this summer. Of late he has widened his experience\nby taking up Squash, Bowls, and the attendance\nof weddings as Best Man. His ambition however\nis to drive a London bus.\nIn 1952-3 he was chairman of the i.O. Soci al Clubs Committee and his reo or d of completing\nan S. C.C. meeting in5 minutes flat is still un-broken. Last year in addition to representing Guilds on Council he was disciplinary officer for the hostel. As he managed to be present at most of the merry parties from the start he\nwas seldom in ao on d ltl on to do any serious disciplining when the proceedings verged on th d riotous. There was the celebrated occasion last New Year's Eve when he entered a room at random a t2o 'clock in the morning and shook its somnolent occupant into life for the purpose of\nwishing him, in earnest tones and with altogether unnecessary rep it it ion,a happy and prosperous\nnew year. It was subsequently discovered that the recipient of these inebriate greetings was\na member of staff. Mike's preoccupation with gliding and alcohol led him to rather ne gl eot women. At a party last year the question of a partner to accompany him to a forthcoming college ball cropped up. On his suggestion the girls presents e leo ted one for him from amongst themselves by\nspinning a coin. He felt it was fairer that they should all have an equal chance of going.\nThe various interested female students, who suggested an ICWA rota for future functions, had a nasty shook on reading a recent copy of the\nDaily Telegraph wherein was announced the engagement of some other Mlohael_John Neale. However\nthe fluttering of lowari an hearts has been calmed \u2022\nby a firm declaration of the presidential policy of continuing bachelor hood. The chromium-plated re sea roh apparatus which\nMike has built over the past 5 years is now ex-u ding results mu oh to the surprise of all concerned.\nThere is even a possibility that sufficient will accrue during the year for the writing of a thesis. However we o an rely on Mike not to waste too mu oh time on this sideline while he has the task of\ncoping with the moat complex and lively students'\nUnion of the metropolis. PH C ENIX Aft or several years' active connection with literature In Imperial College, I have come to bel i eve that Phoenix exists primarily for the benefit of its writers; not for the readers, who merely\ndefray some of the costs of publication. Phoenix\nlost much of its original function when FELIX began\nto publish news, but It has still the advantage of\nbeing able to make unlimited space and an impeccable\nstandard of production available to serious reports and essays. In the last few years, it has been\nclear that these facilities have been neglected: the\nonly people who have concerned themselves with literary shapeliness have been the few who have written on inconsequential matters. Everything serious has\nbeen shockingly written. There has Just been an opportunity for this pitiful state of affairs to be mended: our four College Presidents and two other students went to Germany on a tour of technical institutions. I do not\nknow how much money was spent on this; neither do I know whether any official re poets of the visit have\nbeen submitted In any quarters( though a beer y write up app ered in FELIX ) ; but the account of the tour wh i oh takes up two pages of the Phoenix under review,\nis dull and useless. There Is no sparkle, no show\nof interest, no joy of creation shown In this report. One would suppose that a fortnight's free holiday for six of our highest Union Officers might produce\nsomething more Imaginative than this. What a relief it is to turn to Selby Angus's short story \"The Higher Metallurgy\". This is reprint ed, without acknowledgements, from a Phoenix of four years ago. I had rather written \"The Higher Metallurgy\" than obtained my degree. Hay it be reprinted every four years as an example of what students could once wr lte j This re mar keble story is backed up by a other of Peter Rowe's character sketches, \"AS light Touch of Toothache\", which is even better than its predecessor on landladies. Ilr. Rowe seems to have\na phenom enol number of odd aqua ln t ances; may he cont in ue to unburden himself on to us. A third short\nstory, \"Sales Talk' j Is understandably anonymous.\nThere are two poems in this issue: Roger\nWilliam chooses the trite theme of the power of the\nImagination to transcend circumstances, but his very\nthoughtful work demands more lengthy criticism than .\nIs appropriate In this column. Ray Bonnet's \"Baghdad\" bears many marks of this century; I would\nhave enjoyed it more with a few less.( I refer particularly to the irritating affectation of a succession of repeated pairs, as in\" Arauco u a song, a native's song\".) Poems of the quality of these two do not often appear in Phoenix.\nJohn Cox, in \"Science and the Devlopment of\nSociety\" produces interesting statistics on the prop ort ions and numbers of scientists in the World\nPowers, and skims lightly over his the surface of\nthe topic he has chosen for his title. It would\nbe better treated at greater length. Acland Essay\naspirants may like to note the ideal subject.\nThere are a number of other articles in this Phoenix, including the A.C.C, Review (thankless\ntask, but well done), but as they are either unpretentious and un ll tera ry reports, or are by non-students, they do not properly fall v/l thin the scope\nof this article. There is also the usual book\nreview ( Inorganic Analysis), which ought not to be there. ( Who gets a free copy anyway? )\nHaving recorded an honest op pinion of some of\nthe contents of- the latest Phoenix, for which I will\npresumably pay by the loss of a few more friends and the rec lept of some nasty letters, I must add\nthat I consider this the best Phoenix I have re viewed, ( it is the sixth), and is well worth the\ncost. On this last point, congratulations to the\nEdit res s, who has beaten all her predecessors.\nA.R.3, WELCOME BACK We are glad to welcome back the Rector,\nSir Roderio Hill, and to congratulate him on\nhaving recovered from his illness. Unfortunately, he has had to resign from\nhis Vice Chancellorship of the University of\nLondon through ill health, but this i a to the\ngain of Imperial College since we will receive the benefit of his full attention.

Thurman, '.Veale, Kitchener, and Hit c nen scored plenty of rune, and Aul t, Miles, Dytnam, and\nCook snared the wickets. Dytnam was our fastest bowler, and doubtless it was physical ex-haus tion that o a used him to be found unconscious on the floor of the coach at3 a. a. on the last night. No such excuse could be advanced firA v.lt' s unpremeditated decision to sleep at full length on the floor of a saloon Oar in S xe ter,n or for hitchen's strange insistence to sleep I not ner people's beds, only to .be astonished when he woke to find himself t:. ere.\nThe tour began in Plymouth, wit n fine wins overt ne Royal Naval Engineering College and t ne Royal Naval3 ar racks. The party spent a go id\npart of \\ne third nigh in Plymouth Police Station not as a result of any mis demean ours on -.nel r part, but as guests of. he City Police, who nad been tn at day's vanquished opponents. This particular Police Station( unlike the one\nat Hartley Win t ney) quick ley assumed the aspect of a particularly jolly public house, and \"he\nworthy officers of ti.e law revealed t ne:as elves as amiable and entertaining nost B \u2014 so muc u so\nthat I.e.'s fielding the next day was atrocious, i. nl we had to be o on tent with an even draw with t ne Marine s(ax mouth).

For there on\nthe hillside, under the admiring gaze of a herd\nof pre his tori ooo ws( who were seen later that\nmorning paying homage to TRYIN - the -henge god\nof examinations), stood Wood-henge built by the\n-heng is ts to the memory of the 1st Year Civil e who fell in the part I struggles of 1954. (SIC\nRiiPENTIT) Near o losing time, the previous\nevening, under the o hee rful auspices of \"The\nThatched Tavern\", the GRAND PLAN (formed by the\n-henge a roh druids) was explained to the Neolithioan plebs.

    "content": "4 FELIX\n%Jh*, ( Social G\\^ KVl>\nOn -this page we are giving a brief review of last year's Social Events, for the obvious benefit of the Fresher, but also for those older members of the Union who are feeling nostalgic now that the wooden floor of the Gym will no\nlonger shake under the dancers' feet. This review is not intended to be oom ple te in any way, so that we hope the members of the various Clubs, whose activities are not mention ed, will not be offended. The activities of all Clubs are not always suitable for reporting, and\nthis review is strictly as seen through the eyes of FELIX. Even so we have had to leave out the learned Societies, the Debating Society, the Guild e Motor Club, to mention only a few.\nThis year we would like to report as many\nSocial Events as possible, so we ask Club Secretaries to write in when they have anything of interest, so that arrangement so an be made.\nMUSICAL SOCIETY\nThe Music alSo oie ty has always been one W the pillars of the S. C.C., and last year was ano the r of almost continuous activity. Although Dr. Jacques had resigned from the Conductor ship of the Choir, there was no setback, the full mem-ber ship(S. A.T.B.) being maintained at the level of80. The Choir, under its Conductor, Dr. Eric Brown( a member of staff), provided the backbone for the two major concerts last year, given with the Jacques Oro he strain Queen Alexandra' s House.\nUnfortunately the College Orchestra lost some ground, instrumental players of sufficient calibre being rare in I.e. Both the Choir and the Orchestra look for ward to the time when they will be able to have\ntheir own Concert Room in the New Union. RELIGIOUS SOCIETIES\nOne of the most notable features about the serious side of College life has been the growth\nof support for the Religious Societies over the past two years. The Christian Union has reported the most notable increase inactivity during last year, with a doubling of membership.\nThe Student Christian Movement has reported similar progress, with many activities held in combination with ot ner Colleges. Special events in the College last year were the Mission Week,\narranged by I.C'.C. U., which had average attendances of100, and an address by Dr. Billy Graham,\narranged jointly by I.C.C. U. and S. C.M. This was given in the Albert Hall to an audience of2,500. What was a chive dat these events cannot be assessed by mere numbers, but atleast it has been shown that the average student is prepared to be interested in such matters. The Catholic and Jewish Societies provide appropriate activities for their members, each Society numbering about50. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CLUB\nThis Club has become one of the most flourishing in the College, although nearly the youngest, since it was only set up last year. Its aim is to encourage international understanding at the Student level. As well as bringing together members of I.C. from more\nthan20 nations, general audiences of over100 were attracted to stage presentations of national culture, film shows and lectures. It is hoped that the Society will now attempt a more\nactive programme embodying exchanges of ideas in serious debate and discussion, as well as merely entertaining a passive audie no e. ENTERTAINMENTS| drop in at\n\\ JANE BROWN a7, EXHIBITION ROAD\n\u2022 morning* coffee9 K \u2022 . \u2022 lunch \u2022 tea \u2022 \u00bb \u00bb rr \u00ab f \u2022 I*t a* \u00bb * t6Each year the Entertainments Committee do sterling work in organising the lighter side of the College Functions. In the official wording\" it is responsible for the organising of social functions other than those organised by individual clubs and societies\". A masterpiece of understatement. For innumerable years Saturday night 'Hops'\nhave been a by-word for pleasant, carefree evenings at nominal charges. The Commemoration\nBall and the President's Dinner and Dance are annual institutions, and are the best in the University, we like to feel. During the Winter and Spring terms ' hopping' seems to be very popular with I.C., and to cope\nwith those types who actually worry about treading on their partners' toes, the Dancing Club runs Dancing Classes at all levels. Finally mention must be made of the Carnivals. These are organised by the individual College Unions, and o an only be described as all night riots in fano yd res a. Over the past few years these have been some of the themes :-\" Shanghai Showjunk\"; \" Or gia Romana\" ;\n\" Fiesta\";\" Russian Salad\", and many more.\nNOTES FROM THE DRAMATIC SOCIETY\nPerhaps the best way to persuade socially minded fresher s that the Dramatic Society is their best way of enjoying college life is to present a brief review of what we did last year. November: One act play for L.U.D. S. Festival( placed3 rd). December: - \"The Hollow\" with notable su co esse s from some new ao tors. March: \"The Browning Version\" and \"A Phoenix Too Frequent\", the latter play cast entirely from the year' a newcomers.\nMay: The Society held a dance and presented a One act play as entertainment. Several theatre visits were held during the year, also an excursion to Oxford involving dinner and a visit to \"The Government Inspector\". The year finally ended with a trip to Cheltenham in the early part of the long vacation,\nwhen a dozen members put on two play a and, in o id'ent ly, had a good holiday. We hope to put on as varied a programme\nthis year, in spite of the apparent difficulties, and, as ever, to enjoy our activities to the full. OPEN AIR SOCIETIES\nThe Mountaineering Club, theY. H.A. Group,\nthe Riding Club and Ski Club all had a successful year, although naturally Kensington is not ideally situated for some of these activities. The Ski Club and the Rover Crew both travelled to Switzerland during the Session; the S^.i Club to an hotel for a fortnight at Xmas, and the Rc ver Crew to the World Rover Moot, also at Xmas.\n\" b lO YOU PUT THE.

The problem of where to hold 'Hops' is a diff i ou lt one, there being two main alternatives. Firstly the use of outside premises, i.e. the Town Hall, or Q.A. and Q.E.

This latter o our se is obviously preferable; here the possibilities are sUpper Dining Hall and New Lounge 'wired' together, Queeni&'s( for formal dances only) , and the use of Imperial Institute space, i.e. Jehan gir Hall. There will be only one Committee Room, on the j rd. floor, East, of the Be it Building. The\nI. C.W.

SEELEY\nCirculation;1200 For the first time the readers of FELIX are able to start off a new Session with an Is sue on the very first day of term; but before we explain how this has come about we must address a few words to the Fresher. At this time of year they are the most Important people in the whole of I.e. So them the whole Idea of I.e. will seem a little strange, and the idea of FELIX very strange( as well a a Its appearance). Words of encouragement do not flow easily from this oo lu mn, but Fresher s we really are very glad to see all of you.

For this the Gym was decorated with flowers and the floral arrangements at the top of the stairs were noted in the' Evening Standard' albeit only for the de so ent of the goldfish on to the floor. Those invited enjoyed ample spa oe for dancing and a rather unusual cabaret in wh i oh Tony Gill( the ex president of C.A G.) displayed hidden talent in his playing of a drum a ooo mpa nie ment for Tull is Sutherland' s piano' reo it al'.

This waa noted again at Burnham Week where Tony\nRodgers and Anton Brown were sailing F654.It was found however that ao or reo tion must be\napplied when a particularly good wind follows a particularly good party; the result is a caps ize.

    "content": "F \u00a3 LI \u00a5 7\n( 3 \u00a3 AL j vom.* W Dear Fresher, Our Editor, in his wisdom, is of the opinion that a short note from the oldest active member of the FELIX Board may be of interest to you. It is with some astonishment that I find this honour j falling on me, and with much trepidation that I record my experiences and ideas on a few questions which have been Important in my University life. There is nothing in these notes for our glib young-ra an about-town: I write only In the hope\nthat some of you areas sly, confused and lost as1 I was when I entered our college. Only four years have passed since I crept into the Books tall and bought a scarf( which represented Student hood to my young brain), and then stuffed it into my pocket because I was too self conscious to wear It. I soon learned that I need not skulk in disguise, for the Fresher is not a target for jibes and sneers; Indeed the same day a thousand officials from a hundred\nclub surged me most piteously to Join them in their particular road to Elysium. In those days a high percentage of the older students were ex servicemen, and many were old enough (and experienced enough) to be my father. They were much more self a a sure d than the people who arrived straight from the sixth form, and they occupied all the important poe it ions in the Union. We lived in awe of them - for the first few days. The percentage of ex servicemen has fallen considerably since then, and it seems to me that with this decline we have become more steady, sober and Industrious, much less interesting, and much less enterprising in Union affairs generally. This view may, however, suffer from abbe rations associated with my extreme age.\nIn our early Fresher days, moat of my contemporaries studied conscientiously, and went home at five o clock. I was among them. After a term \u00abr so I began to yearn for female company, but having been equipped with an efficient mental chastity belt at school, I was very reserved, awkward in company and, worse, unable to dance. The latter defect atleast could be repaired, so\nI bought a book on Ballroom Dancing( the Union Library has since been equipped with one) and grimly learned a few stepson the floor of my\nlodgings. Theij, with palpitating heart, glistening brow,' dry tongue and hands dripping with sweat, I went to a hop. It was a dreadful,' experience, but It was the beginning of my college life. I was fortunate enough to share lodgings with several other students, and we wasted a great deal of time together. We would often spend half the\nnight dia cussing Politics, Religion, Art, Women,\nProstitution and allied subjects, Morality, Books, and the World as it was beginning to unfold to us. We worked sufficiently to pass our exams, with a little to spare.( We found it helpful to suppose\nthat anybody who learns everything in his syllabus not only has no time to learn anything else, but oust surely go mad). We were never in danger of madness or suicide, and the a e discussions form some of the pleasantest memories of my life. In due course I came into contact with the\nStudent Rag. We dashed down the streets and did things collectively which none of us would have\ndone alone. I saw acts of wanton destruction( a mashing aB elisha beacon, for instance) which would have been called vandalism or hooliganism had they been perpetrated by the \" lower classes\" But on other occasions, Morphy Day, the Great Victoria Rag, and at several informal battles between R.C.S. and Guilds, I witnessed scenes\nwhich Is hall always remember with delight. It i seems a quality of Rags that they appear best in retrospect.( The back numbers of FELIX, available a taj rtl yIn the Union Library, contain account^ of many of these events). 'to yearn for fema A e company' You may have already run your head into the eternal problem of the Cultural relations of the Scientist. It is widely understood that \"Culture'\nmeans recognising Picasso' s blue period, Beethoven' s Quartet Op. 59, No.2, ( first movement,\nsecond subject), or Shelley' s \"Prometheus Unbound.\"\nIf you know nothing about the a e you can learn something by going to the I.C. General Studies Lectures, and by reading a few carefully ch03en books: by becoming, in fact, a Kul tur conscious Bore. This is rather like sitting in front of an infrared lamp in Stepney, and then boa at lng of your Riviera holiday. Surely, a cultured person is one who is responsive to beauty, and who\nla repelled by ugliness, and who makes his own\nlife, and others, happier and richer by his reaction a to all external conditions. Knowledge\nof the list above may help in the achievement of such a state, but so may many other things, one of the most Important being the rational discipline and aesthetic appeal of Science. In this reap ect we have an advantage over the Arte man, although many s cie ntl st a neglect it, with the result that we have a collective reputation for moroni sh ness. Do not be intimidated by the coma on, erroneous, petty conception of\" Culture\". It may seem to you that I. C.iaa bit of a hole. Our Union Is in a shocking condition: we\nhave nowhere to eat comfortably; we have nowhere\nto s it. The authorities promise us eventual relief from these Inconveniences, but we cannot\nexpect it for year a, and it will be inadequate when it arrive a. Until we have a high percentage\nof residential students our college will always be\nsomething less than a University. But it i a the centre of our lives for several yaar a, and it provides us with the greatest of all boons; the companionship of kindred api rita. If you neglect your fellows at college you will pay for It in loneliness and frustration. Do not go home\nregularly at five o' clock. Stay for supper\noccasionally and talk with your new friends. Have a drink every now and then, but not alone. And pity the poor post grad who ha a to dash\nback to hi a lab! Yours sincerely, Watt A. Wordsworth.\nP.S. Pardon my use of a nom de plume, but it i a hallowed with time, and is better known\nthan my name.\nTELEPHONE : We close on\nKENSINGTON1276 Saturday Afternoons\nLAM LEY& Co.Lt d.
