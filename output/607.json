    "content": "It is rare that a place like IC gets a chance to\nhost the debut gig of an important new band,\nand even rarer for a band of the quality of\nWeekend. It's a pity, then, that more IC\nstudents didn't turn up on Wednesday night;\nil though there was a reasonable crowd, a fair\n.ro portion of these were outsiders.\nThe last thing Weekend want is to be\ncompared to the Young Marble Giants,\nalthough with two-thirds of that band being\nfeatured in Weekend they may have some\ndifficulty in avoiding it at first. Alison Statton's vocals are as sublime as ever \u2014 more\nconfident if anything. She certainly seems\nmuch more self-assured and relaxed on stage\nthan she used to be. The lead guitarist plays in\na beautiful melodic style, largely African\ninfluenced, which blends nicely with the vocal\nline. The use of percussion, addition to drums,\nprovides a good varied rhythmic background.\nSome of the numbers use hams; Harry\nBeckett, the trumpet player, is well-known in\njazzy circles, but seems a little misplaced here.\nLarry Stafford, on the other hand, blends with\nthe style of the band very nicely. This is the\nmore surprising because Larry normally plays\nonly free form and avant garde jazz.\nThe band seemed a little tense and\nrestrained, although with the hype and the\nhigh expectations surrounding them this is\nhardly surprising. They played a secret warm\nup gig at the Rock Garden a few days\npreviously, at which they managed to put more\nbounce into the music. Hopefully this will\nreappear as soon as they settle down to some\nregular gigging.\nThe most apt description of the music would\nbe melodic and quietly exuberant. Probably\nthe best compliment paid them was that the\nconcert was attended and enjoyed by several\npeople who don't listen to and don't like rock\nmusic. What more can you say?\nDave Jago\nThe H.G. Wells Society will be screening the\nfifties science fiction classic Forbidden Planet\non Monday at 7:30pm in the Sutton Lecture\nTheatre, Mines Building.

Teams travel from throughout the UK and across the Channel\nto participate in this event, including entries\nsuch as Chris Mc George and Christina Boxer, both 800m champions, together with\nSebastian Coe running for Loughborough\nUniversity.\nIn all there will be more than 120 mens\nteams and 40 ladies teams, along With 10\nforeign teams competing. The race is over a fast course with six legs of three miles for men\nand four legs of two miles for ladies.\nAfter the race, prizes will be presented by\nDrA.

Despite some aggressive\nswimming on our part, they put away 15\ngoals to our 3.\nThe following night, however, saw us on winning form as we inflicted a53 defeat on St Bart's Hospital. This was a somewhat\nturbulent match during which Last, never\nthe most subtle of players, was twice sent out\nfor over-enthusiastic fouling, and Garton was\nalso removed for rather obvious knuckling of\nthe opposition.\nLeach put about six shots in the general\ndirection of the Bart's goal (one of them even\nwent in), but the miss of the match award\nwent, yet again, to Ashwin, who put an\nimpressive shot at least live feet over the bar\nand almost into the spectator's gallery.\nOn the rare occasions when we got our\ngame together we scored a few goals, which\ncame from Carton, Cas in i, Ashwin and Leach, but in general, we played a poorly\norganised game, and the only remedy for that\nis more Fosters.\nTeam: As/twin (Capt), Burnett (goalie), Casini,\nDibden, Edwards, Boucher, Garton, Last, Leach,\n(fit) Rugby\nSeconds\nThe second team set off again, map and\ncompass in hand under the intrepid leadership of the returning collapse-a capt.\nThe game started badly with the Che mEng1 contingent suffering from the previous\nevening's antics in Stan's. Our glorious captain inspired us to a63 deficit by halftime which we attribute to his lovers tiff with\nChris Cole. In a tense and gruelling second\nhalf, Mark Hudson kicked us back level. Mick Windsor then pulled his hamstring and had\nto retire leaving Noddy to step into the\nbreach, playing with the grit of a prop\nforward, which was pretty unfortunate since\nhe was meant to be scrum-half. The score\nremained eventhough Mark Simmons received concussion and a broken jaw in a last-ditch tackle, and Marc Hudson just\nmissed a penalty from our own half.\nTired and sleepy we wound our weary way\nhome, seemingly only days later re ching the\ncomforting lights of toy town and bobo s.^ Hockey\nLadies\nHaving discovered that a WO had been\ndeclared over St Mary's( League) and that a 'friendly' had been arranged against UCL, half the team decided that they didn't want\nto play. Caroline( alias Cap' n Birdseye)\nreckoned that our bodies needed exercise,\ndespite the fact that a few of us have been\n'getting it' fairly regularly lately.\nPlaying with two UCL players, 'cos there\nwere only eight of us, we managed to score\nthe first goal. Contributions came from Alison C.(6%), Sara (10%) and Karen(84%). However, Alison later managed to notch up a hat-trick of misses. Luckily, some of the team\nhad been to the opticians recently, and this\nresulted in Sara, Alison L. and Alison C. managing to find the goal with their shots.\nAfter the final score of 5-4 to them, we\nretired to the changing rooms. When we\ndiscovered that Caroline was going to have a shower, the rest of us decided that the quicker\nwe get to the bar, the better.\nTeam: Alison C. Alison L.

Parker\nDear Mark Smith\nOh dear. In his Soapbox\narticle ( FELIX606) on the\nSoc Soc's\" Radical\" news-sheet, N. Willson has surely\ndropped ac langer. He criticises the comment in the\nEditor's Intro \"Please ex s cuse( sic) any spelling or grammatical er ros as we can't all\nhave a public school education \", as \" insult(ing)\npeople who went to a public\nschool, as if it was their fault?\"\n(his emphasis). Is it not that\nthe comment criticises the\npublic school system (and\nrightly so), with its foundation\nupon privilege, rather than\npeople who have gone through\nthe system? I rather think so.\nPerhaps, in future, N. Willson\nmight learn to understand the\nwords, rather than taking exception to what he mistakenly believes to be written\nbetween the lines.\nTours good-spirited ly Donald Craig Chem2 Dear Mark\nNick Will son's Soapbox article.,in last week's FELIX about Socialist Society was\nfairly well reasoned and thought provoking. In reference to last term's Soc Soc\nnew sheet, Radical, he gave\nthe impression that leftists in\ngeneral, and SocS oc in particular, are paranoid, self-obsessed and arrogant. This\nmay be true, it's hard for me\nto be objective. I hope that\nanyone who wants to make\ntheir own judgement will obtain a copy of Radical, either from me or Ian House,\nLife Sci 1 (they don't cost\nanything).\nHowever, Mr Will son made several basic errors. His\nclaim that the articles in Radical attack multinational\ncompany directors and right\nwing politicians personally, not\nthe system they have to work\nwithin, is completely false.\nNowhere in the article on\nmultinationals, for example,\nis a company director mentioned personally. We are not\nunwilling to admit that our\nopponents are normal people.\nThey are caught up in the\nsystem as much as anybody\nelse; the manager who works\nten hours a day and at\nweekends in his spare time;\nwho, because of all his material possessions, has more to\nworry about; who cannot spend much time with his\nchildren; who suffers from\nstomach ulcers; who dies just\na few years after retirement....\nhe too is a victim of capitalism.\nIt is the system we object to,\nand its corruption and destruction of human dignity.\nI find it strange that Mr Willson should object to the\ncomment in the Editor's Intro\nabout public schools, and to\nthe person who advocated the\n\"secret candidate\" approach\nto Union elections (in fact he's not a member of Soc Soc)\ngrinning as he put forward\nthe idea. Usually it's left\nwingers who are accused of\nbeing unable to take a joke!\nHe says \" a cartoon showing\na disgustingly fat white man\n(the West) carelessly scattering crumbs to a starving black\n(the developing world) is\ngoing to cause irritation and\nresentment among people who might be open to per-sua sion\". If they see the\ncartoon as a personal attack\nthen they're as paranoid as we\nare. If they believe the\ncartoon is untrue or unfair,\nthen I accept that we should\nbe arguing our case at a more\nbasic level.\nSocialist Society attempts\nto influence people's attitudes,\ngenerally by advertising what\nwe see to be the truth. If we\nbecome arrogant, then I would welcome criticism to\nthat effect, but we will not\nbetray our ideals merely to\nget more popular support. If\nthat was all we wanted then\nperhaps we should stop\ntalking about politics al together. However, the Soc\nSoc mailing list had sixty-five\nnames on it at the beginning\nof this year; now it stands at\nninety-eight.\nTours sincerely\nRobert Kelsey\nCiv Eng2 Soc Soc Chairperson\nDear Mark\nWith reference to Ian Hodgson's letter ( FELIX606) I should like to make the\nfollowing points:\nThe S CC \"booze up\" was\nfinanced with \u00a320 of S CC funds specifically earmarked\nfor entertainment, and by\ncontributions from Stephen\nGoulder and Mrs Pingree, the\nCollege Archivist. The effect ive capita cost of those\nattending was about \u00a31. The\nevening was highly successful,\nenabling S CC members, usually lou nd heckling each\nother, to relax and mingle.\nThis can only be good for\nS CC and IC Union\"\nContrast that with Welfare\nDay. Not more than30 people attended any single\nevent during the afternoon.\nThe programme was arranged\nwith a lot of time, effort and\nmoney. The per capita cost\nfor those who did turn up was\naround \u00a34 or \u00a35. The benefit?\nGood for a very small number\nof people.\nIf you readers agree with\nMr Hodgson then we must\nexpect an outcry at the\n\"waste of money\" on Welfare\nDay rather than expressions\nof disquiet at the very low\nattendance. What are our\npriorities?\nTours disappointed ly Jon Barnett\nPhysics 1\nDear Mark\nI feel duty bound to reply\nto the letter in the last issue of\nFELIX written by Martin Taylor. I'm sorry that I cannot answer his question\nmyself, since being bound up\nin the organisation I was\nunable to attend much of the\ndiscussion. I can only suggest\nthat he asks someone who was\nthere (though I shouldn't spend too much time looking)\nor phones Gay Switchboard\non 8 3 7 - 7 3 2 4 \u2014 they' ll be\nhappy to discuss it.\nTours sincerely\nNick Pyne\nPS: Bollocks to everyone who\ncouldn't be bothered to come\nalong!\nDear Mark\nI am most surprised at the\nrecent controversy over the\nuse of the IC Radio Logo on\nposters, advertising the Links\nCarnival, on two counts.\nFirstly, Mr Nunns states in\nhis letter ( FELIX606) that\npermission was not obtained\nfrom the station to use the\nlogo. I find this hard to\nunderstand, as I know Mr Neil Sykes, IC Radio Man a ger, to be a most charitable\nand friendly person, and I feel\nsure that if approached in the\nSouthside Bar, where he is to\nbe found most evenings, and\noffered a pint of cider, he\nwould have given the required\npermission.\nSecondly, I cannot see any\nreason why the Links Carnival\nshould be publicised with posters showing a hardly visible crocodile in the top\nright-hand corner. I have it\non good authority that the\nreason for the crocodile on IC\nRadio's logo is that Crocodile\nRock by Elton John was the\nfirst record played on the\nmedium wave service of the\nstation. It will surely be some\nyears yet before the music of\nElton John is considered so\nunfamiliar and unacceptable\nto the average IC student to\nmerit its live exposure at an\nevent such as the Links Carnival.\n\" Puzzled\" Falmouth/ Keo gh Hall Election Manifestoes( not\nto exceed 300 words) must be\nsubmitted to the Editor by\n1:00pm, Monday, March1, accompanied by ab/ w photo.\nPage 2 FELIX, February 26, 1982\n\n"

In a short but moving speech he\nexpressed his desire that the club would\nprosper under new leadership next year.\nUnfortunately Tim Higg's continuous chatter rather took the edge off this \"gushing\nverbal torrent\".\nSunday's trip to Bisley should provide\nfurther entertainment lor participants.\nTeam: Sleath, Harrison, Smith, Higgs, Helen\nof Troy, Sarah B., Michelle, Kev, Denk-al-Alam,\nTony Briers, etc.\nFootball\nFifths\nIn some recent studies I have shown that the\npreparation of a win takes place in three\nsteps:\nOpponent + ball S J^I CV+ ball \u2014(1)\nI CV+ ball = goal \u2014(2)\nOpponent + ball = goal \u2014(3)\nIn my latest study, the opponents being\nRoyal Holloway College III, the equilibrium\nin (1), for the first forty-five minutes was far\nto the right-hand side due to hard work and\ngood running. Consequently, step (2) was\ndominant and was catalysed effectively by a complex known as Dave Stephenson, the\nhalf-time score being 6-0. In the latter stages\nof the reaction, the equilibrium in(1) was\nmoved to the left-hand side by Phil Niccolls\nand the catalyst for reaction (2) was poisoned\ndue to the thought of two jugs (3 goals + 1 jug of beer). However, step (3) was inhibited by a strong and resourceful defence and only one\ngoal was scored, and this was due to the\nkeeper's open legs.

The benefits of training had obviously\nbeen spoilt by some activity the previous\nnight (Links Carnival?) for we didn't get a single first in any race.

This and the\nfact that we were only given ten minutes to\nchange led to a very slow start by IC. Soon\nthe pack, with C.De Rohan making his\ndebut and our collapsible captain, Bell, began to take control. It wasn't long before\nRalph scored from a five yard (1.5 metre)\nscrum. This was how it remained until halftime when the oranges seemed to wake everybody up. There then followed a number\nof fluent moves, with Noddy appearing everywhere. This resulted in four tries of\nwhich two were especially good as everybody\nhad a hand in them. The tries by Nic Brummel, Alastair Davies, Jose Paxaio and\nMarc Hudson were all in the corners and so\nleft Marc with little chance of converting\nthem. Thus the final score was 20-0.\nThen it was down the pub and back in time to watch England try to play rugby.\nTeam: M. Hudson, A. Davies, N. Brummel,\nW. Chapman, O. Miles, M. Thompson, J.

    "content": "REDS Certificate AA Starring Warren\nBeatty, Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson.\nThe cinema epic has all but died since the days\nof Doctor Zhiuago and Lawrence of Arabia,\nbut Warren Beatty's REDS (which opened\nyesterday) marks a return to that era.\nThe story of John Reed, an American writer\nwho witnessed the Soviet Revolution and\nrecorded his experience in his book Ten Days\nThat Shook The World, has obsessed Beatty\nfor many years. His screen adaptation of\nReed's life and love for radical feminist Louise\nBryant (Diane Keaton) is set against the\nbackdrop of the upheavals in Russia and\nAmerica, which provides a fascinating subject\nin a long and stylish film.\nReed meets Bryant in Portland Oregan in\n1915 when he is a journalist working on matters of social injustice. He soon becomes\ninvolved in both politics and with Bryant,\nwho he takes to New York to join his\nintellectual friends in Greenwich Village. They\nsoon marry despite Louise's involvement with\nplaywright Eugene O 'Neill (Jack Nicholson).\nJohn Reed's political activities eventually\nthrow them apart but they are reunited when\nhe takes his wife to Russia and they witness\nthe Soviet Revolution at first hand.\nBeatty has chosen an unusual approach to\nhis topic; the story is introduced and interrupted by interviews with \"the witnesses\",\nfriends and acquaintances of Reed and Bryant\nwho recount gossip and stories from that era.\nThese old faces remain irritatingly un in tr d duce d, and include Rebecca West, author\nHenry Miller, Lady Dora Russell and many\nmore beside. They add a personal reality to the\nstory and tend to serve as links between a series of fractured events. Whilst this\ntechnique works quite well, I can't help feeling\nthat the faces really should have been identified.\nBeatty is convincing as Reed and his\nobsessive love for Louise Bryant was matched\nby a romance off screen with Diane Keaton\nduring filming. The screenplay centres on the\nrelationship between Reed and Bryant and\nthus both lead characters. I found Diane Keaton a great disappointment, frozen into her\nsingle screen persona and almost incapable of\nexpressing a convincing range of emotion.\nApart from this the casting is very strong; Jack\nNicholson turns in another great tight-lipped\nperformance as Eugene O'Ne ill, Maureen Stapleton shines as the cynical Emma Goldman and author Jerzy Kos in ki( who\nwrote Being There) is suitably grim as the\nfanatical Bolshevik leader Zinoviev. These\ncharacters play out their roles amidst the\nconfusion and excitement of the time. John\nTAPS Reed eventually found s the American Communist Labour Party and goes to Moscow\nfor recognition, where he is prevented from\nreturning to America. Separated from his wife,\nhe attempts to escape and is eventually\nreunited before his premature death at the age\nof 32.\nReed was indeed an interesting man and\nWarren Beatty has used his life to produce an\nentertaining and informative film.\nThis page: (top right) George C. Scott as General Harlan Bache in Taps (centre) Warren\nBeatty is reunited with Diane Keaton in Reds and (above) Timothy Hutton inspects some of\nthe cadets who seize a military academy in Taps.\nCert A. Starring George C. Scott and\nTimothy Hutton. Directed by Harold\nBecker.\nWhen a military academy steeped in 140 years\nof tradition is informed by the powers that be\nthat it must close so that the land can be\ndeveloped for real estate, it is time to fight\nback. When the General commanding the\nschool is removed from the scene by heart\nfailure, leaving the senior cadet in charge of the\nacademy, the resulting situation is, if you'll\npardon the expression, explosive.\nTimothy Hutton plays Brian Moreland, the\ncadet left in charge when General Harolan\nBache( George C. Scott) is rushed into\nintensive care. Moreland, anticipating the\nimmediate closure of the academy, organises\nthe seizure of the armour y. Thus armed, the\ncadets seal the perimeter and prevent access\nto the grounds using armed force. The authorities are unwilling to listen to their\ndemands for reconsideration of the closure,\nand a siege results.\nThe success of the film rests largely in the\nway that tension is built up and sustained\nduring the course of the sei ge. The point of\nview is constantly and cleverly flipped so that\nour sympathies alternately lie with Moreland,\nfor sticking to his principles and his ideal of\n\"honour above all\", or with Colonel Kirby, the\nNational Guard colonel sent in to defuse the\nsituation, who is terrified that he might have to\norder his men to open fire on what is\nessentially a bunch of school kids. The character is at ions are very strong, although there is just a touch of stereotyping\nwith the characters shown, the overzealous\nmilitaristic type, and Alex, Moreland's roomate\nand sometime conscience. These two characters are presented as the principal opposing influences on Moreland's thinking,\nand in places, this is in danger of becoming a touch clich ed. In the end though, the acting\ncarries the day, and the character clashes\nwithin the ranks of the cadets are as\ninteresting as the clashes with the troops\noutside.\nThe result is a film rich in tension, ideas and\nexcitement. Will the National Guard be\nordered in? If so, will the cadets open fire on\nthem? Or is there some other way out? See it\nand find out.\nDave Jago\nFELIX, February 26, 1982 Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "An Iraqi student has brought me the\nfollowing article which, for reasons of his\nown personal security, I have allowed to\nbe written anonymously\nIRAQ\nStudents staged a picket outside the Iraqi\nEmbassy recently to protest against the fascist\n.Ba'ath dictatorship in Iraq. Around one\nhundred people participated together with\nmembers of the Iraqi Students Society in UK( membership of which carries life imprisonment under Ba'ath laws.) The picket is part of\na month of solidarity with the people of Iraq on\nthe anniversary of the first Ba'ath coup in\nFebruary 1963.\nThe coup unleashed a bloody reign of terror\nunknown in Iraq. In a few weeks, over 10,000\nwere killed. Leaders and activists of mass\ndemocratic organisations and trade unions\nwere hunted down, tortured and executed.\nMany were students, members of the General\nUnion of Students in Iraqi Republic (GUSIR).\nInternationally known leaders of GU SIR such\nas Abdul Al-Balati, Sahib AlMer za and Adnan Al-Barrak were tortured to death. Schools,\ncolleges and sports grounds, became centres\nof interrogation and death. Instrumental in\nterror was the Ba'a this t nazi-style 'National\nGuard'. The infamous National Union of Iraqi\nStudents( NU IS), as part of the security\nservices, victimised, tortured and killed many\nstudents in order to destroy GU SIR. Only growing popular pressure, armed Kurdish resistance, international isolation and\nbankruptcy of the Junta ended its bloody rule\nnine months later.\nToday's Ba'a this t regime came to power in a coup in 1968. The political apprenticeship of its\nleaders was served in the 'National Guard' in\n1963. It is a capital offence to leave the Ba'ath\nparty, belong to another political party, or\nconceal previous affiliation (Article 200, 1969\nPenal Code).\nMass executions, poisoning by Thallium,\nracist 'Arabinisation' policies, deportation of\nKurds and Shi'a moslems (over 60,000 people\ndeported since 1980) are all policies enacted by\nthe present Ba'a this t regime under its\nPresident, Saddam Hussein. The bloody war\nagainst Iran initiated as a chauvinist war of\naggression has killed over 50,000 and injured\nmany more.\nSaddam' s regime has no qualms about\ntorturing and killing even children. Ali Hama\nSalih, twelve years old was recently tortured to\ndeath (Amnesty International report March5,1981). Many hundreds of people in Iraq have\ndisappeared without trace and although little is\nknown about their whereabouts, Amnesty\nInternational reports provide little doubt that\nextensive and widespread torture is being\ncarried out in Iraq. .\nThe Ba'ath dictatorship distinguishes itself\nfrom other fascist regimes through its export\nof terror; through assassinations, kidnapping\nattacks, and intimidation in which the Iraqi\nEmbassy and the NU IS are instrumental.\nThe latest attack took place on Saturday,\nFebruary 6, in Birmingham on a member of the\nIraqi Students Society UK following a solidarity\nmeeting, at which agents from the Embassy,\nincluding one from the military attac he, were\nidentified and excluded. Two days later in\nDenby, a high velocity air gun was fired at the\nwindow of an Iraqi ISS member's flat. These\ntwo incidents mark an increase in surveillance\nand harassment by members of the Iraqi\nSecurity Staff, and the nature of them is highly\ndisturbing. One of the fears is that the death\nlists drawn up by the embassy naming ISS\nmembers (exposed by the British press in\n1979) will now be acted upon.\nMPs sponsoring CARD RI( Committee Against Repression and for Democratic Rights\nin Iraq) have put down an Early Day Motion in\nthe House of Commons calling for an inquiry\ninto the activities of the Iraqi Embassy. The\nmotion was signed by MPs from the Labour,\nLiberal and Conservative parties and Plaid\nCymru. Facts about NUIS\n1. Formed1961 by a small group of\nBa'a this ts,N U IS was linked closely to student\norganisation, CO SEC, later exposed as a CIA front.\n2. NU IS statutes and policy have never\nreferred to the academic rights of students.\n3. Membership of any other mass organisation is punishable by life imprisonment.\n4. NU IS is instrumental in the barring of all\nnon-Ba'a this t students from education.\n5. NU IS has been de-recognised by most\nBritish student unions.\nDemocractic opinion in the UK from all\nquarters, including students unions, trade\nunions, MPs and individuals have spoken out\nagainst NU IS and the Embassy's activities. It is\nclear that great pressure must be put on the\nBritish government to end the criminal activites of the Iraqi Embassy, particularly\nsince it has recently negotiated a Elbillion\ncontract for an arms deal with Iraq. Such trade\nonly serves to maintain repression and prop up\na blood-thirsty regime. The development of\ntrade should not be used as an excuse for\nignoring the violation of human and democratic\nrights in Iraq and the export of Ba'a this t thug ger y in Britain. ' ^it\\ ed Iraqi students v,^ after kidnap attempt\nBy Shyama Perera the Committee Against Repres-1\nIraqi students In Britain who sion and for Democratic Rights\noppose the regime there risk in Iraq.\nbeing kidnapped and forcibly Mr Morton, CAR DR I's returned home by government national chairman, said las\nagents, an MP said yesterday. night: \" The attackers were ur\n-\u2014\u00bb*t \u00bb^George Morton, the known to Mr Hafidh but ev\n~*ai\n~~iar Manchester den ce we have trom pre vio \u00ab-j \u00a3a a i attacks on Iraqi students \"\nii \u00ab\u00abj vith the embassy.\n/^c77 been\nSlugs or Politicians?\nby Jeff Fowler\nNot many would contest that the reason why\nICU is held in such general contempt is the\nabsence of drive, initiative and concern for\nstudents that the Exec exhibit. It occurs to me\nthat this could be linked to the reasons they\nstand for office\u2014the 'up through the ranks of\nhacks and sideways to the throne' syndrome\ndescribed by Andrew Lyall .1 have a depressing\nimage of hacks scrabbling for campaign issues\nrather than expounding the changes they see\nas necessitating their candidature.\nSome groups at IC may recoil from the\nnotion of politicizing the Union, but it must be\nobvious that only those candidates with a coordinated range of objectives, and a genuine\npersonal commitment to them, will inject any\nreal life into ICU. I'm not suggesting that we\nshould rush off to express solidarity with the\nFalkland Islanders, but political issues demand\na political response, and on some aspects of\ngovernment our lack of even a policy is\ndamning. The present government's attitude\nto construction expenditure should make Civ\nEng reach for the bicycle clips, but ICU doesn't even bother with the usual token\nappeasement on that one.\nIt should be obvious that even Bill Cortazzi's mob are concerned with some aspects of\nsociety in general, which affect us directly, but\nwhich apparently do not appear of marginal\ninterest to the current Exec. I hope that this\nyear there will be candidates campaigning on\npolitical issues, and that you will tell the other\nusual crowd of hacks and jokers to get lost,\nbefore they tell you to get lost on important\nmatters which affect us all. Politics may not\nappear to offer as much superficial fun as sex\nand beer, but over the past years, how much\nfun have you derived from watching( or\nunderstandably not bothering to watch) the\nantics of UG Ms of the slugs we usually elect?\nLeave Ents and eating faeces to the CC Us where they seem much more able to manage\nsuch affairs.\nTo Serve Us\nAll Our Days\nby Robyn Morgan\nIn FELIX605, Andrew Lyall, in his article \"1982\nPresidential Election\", put forward a view\nwhich is shared by a significant proportion of\nIC students; \"....The normal procedure for\nelecting a Union President relies on candidates\nwho have been \" brought up through the\nranks\" in the Union way of thinking and after\nthe votes have been counted, they take a single step sideways and sit down in the\nPresidential Chair \" (my emphasis). This\nidea is most emphatically wrong. The only\nqualification for a person to stand for any\nsabbatical post is that s/ he can find one\nproposer and ten second ers and the only way\nthat they may then become a sabbatical officer\nis to be the most 'popular' (for want of a better\nword) candidate. It can, and no doubt will, be\nargued that having had a Union post of some\nsort makes a candidate more suitable as a prospective sabbatical but it is the students\nwho vote who decide on this and other issues\nrelevant to the elections. Sabbaticals (or, for\nthat matter, any other union officers) are not\nelected by union 'activists' nor are they elected\nby the students who do not vote\u2014an obvious\npoint perhaps but one that should be made\nwhen only one third of the potential voters\nactually exercise their vote in sabbatical\nelections.\nTo sum up: use your vote to choose the\nsabbaticals that you want.\nPage 5\n\n"

The games to be played: squash on Friday evening,\nhockey Saturday lunchtime, football lunchtime and, most important of\nall, the 'Bottle Match' on Saturday afternoon.\nIn the squash RS M were squarely beaten by a team of lecturers\nwhose Unioncards had long been filed in the archives. The hockey was\nlost 2-1 and the football, after much ado, was drawn22. Last, but not least, the Bottle Match. The RS M forwards did a magnificent job against what was expected to be a far superior 'pack'.\nHowever on the day, the Camborne' Warriors' of the 1-8 proved to be\nonly a fair match. The Camborne 'backs' kicked and grunted and\nthough not as talented as those of RS M the fly-half usefully exploited\nthe predicaments in his penalty kicking. The end result was a loss to\nRS M. Score 15-13. RS M scored two tries and were beaten by penalties\nin a most annoying fashion.\nIn the end the day was won by a most vociferous bunch of supporters\nto whom every player is grateful. They showed the westerners what it\nwas all about.\nRoger Bade\nMining 2\nA Tribute to the ' Camborne Men' For 80 years, since 1902\nThe fine young men of Mines\nHave had only one view\nThrough the courses of time\nThey have run themselves out\nWith one objective, the enemy to rout,\n\"The bottle must be won,\"\nHas been their rallying cry\nDeadly serious \u2014 not in fun\nAnd again this year they will have a try.\nThey fought each other long and hard\nThey battled trying every trick and card\nThey scored a try and converted\nThe other side momentarily diverted\nFrom their course of victory,\nBut not for long do they have the lead\nMines came back and did their deed.\nThey took away the ball\nAnd on and on they ran\nOh, please, Oh please, don't fall\nThe crowd went wild\nOh they cheered to the very last man\nOne broken foot, one twisted ankle\n(But one mustn't iet that rankle)\nWe'll still beat these boys from Camborne\nEven if it means we'll have to fight another dawn\nThat bottle belongs in the Union Bar\nIn that London away so far\nWe must win and have it back\nOr the 120 will have us on the rack\nThe RS M has lost this year\nThey'll drown their sorrow in a beer\nBut in the future, come 1983\nCamborne will have to pay the fee\nAnd we'll have our bottle back \u2014than kee.

    "content": "Peter Egan and Richard Briers in a scene from Shaw's Arms and the Man\nArms and the Man by Bernard Shaw.\nDirected by Jonathan Lynn. The Lyric\nTheatre, Shaftesbury Avenue.\nShaw's comedy takes place in a certain Major\nPetkoffs house in Bulgaria in the 1880s It is a time of war and the Bulgarians have just won a victory over the Serbians, thanks to the daring\nof a dashing young officer, Sergius Saranoff,\nmost captivating ly played by Peter Egan. But\nthe real hero turns out in the play to be a Captain Bluntschli, a Swiss mercenary played\nby Richard Briers who carries chocolate\ncreams in his pockets instead of bullets and is\nmore keen on saving his own skin than seeking\nheroism. The two cha racers get tied up in an\namorous tangle with the Major's daughter,\nplayed by Alice Krige who stars in the recent\nfilm Ghost Story. The result is a delicious\ncomedy that exposes the illusions of warfare,\nlove and romantic idealism. Arms and the\nMan, full of Shaw's inimitable mischievousness,\ndeservedly remains one of his popular plays.\nThe play's earliest days make interesting\nreading. The opening night in 1894 was a huge\nsuccess, but to Shaw's uneasiness the\naudience laughed hysterically throughout the\nplay. He took a curtain call, one of the rare\ntimes he did, and amid the rapturous applause\nhe was greeted by a solitary loud \"Boo\" from a malcontent in the gallery. Shaw turned in his\ndirection and said, \"My Dear fellow, I quite\nagree with you, but what are we two against so\nmany?\" Shaw had the bizarre experience of\nwitnessing an apparently absurd success, his\nwit so diverting his audience's thoughts away\nfrom the play's more serious content that it\nhad been misunderstood as a mere farce. (One\nis reminded of Oscar Wilde where there is\nusually something in each of his plays that\nmight have sent the audience out thinking if he\nhadn't seemed to prefer to send them out\nlaughing). However, not everyone was\namused. To many upright Britishers the play\nwas a 'damning sneer at military courage'. It is\nreported that the play offended the Prince of\nWales, later to become King Edward VII, who\nwas alleged to have muttered during the\nperformance that the author \"must be mad\".\nThe present production at The Lyric is\nsupported by a strong and very amusing cast.\nHowever, I have to admit that like the play's first performances, the element of farce in this\nproduction, and much of it is of a visual nature,\nis a little too dominating. The director of the\nplay, Jonathan Lynn (co-author of the BBC comedy series Yes Minister and director of\nPass the Butler at the Globe Theatre) has\nperhaps not quite applied all the discretion that\nis necessary. Unless a play is a farce per se as\nin the excruciatingly funny Can't Pay? Won't Pay!, it should be subjected to a sparing\namount of farce, as a meal is to a herb or\nspice. The Lyric production is neither\noutstandingly funny nor particularly thought-provoking, but having said that, the play still\nprovides a very entertaining evening!\nNick Bedding\nSkirmishes by Catherine Hayes. Directed\nby Tim Fywell. Hampstead Theatre.\nMy first trip to Hampstead Theatre, one of\nLondon' s most enterprising theatres,\nproduced a few sup rises. First of all the theatre\nis not in Hampstead but next to Swiss Cottage\ntube station. If you emerge from the depths of\nHampstead underground station (as I did)\nthere is a very long walk down the hill to Swiss\nCottage. In addition, this renowned theatre\nturned out to be no more than a small 'prefab',\nbereft of a dignified frontage. But what are\nmere appearances? A theatre to keep your eye\non, it was the home of the immensely\nsuccessful Translations, which is now in\nrepertoire at the National's Lyttelton Theatre,\nand was voted Best New Play of 1981 by the\nLondon Theatre Critics.\nSkirmishes is by Catherine Hayes, a young\nteacher in Liverpool who started writing only\nin 1975. It studies the relationship between a dying mother and her two daughters in a humorous and harrowing way. An amazing\namount can be pieced together in the mere\neighty minutes' duration of the play. Jean\n(played by Frances de la Tour who here takes\non her first stage role since her award-winning\nperformance in Duet for One) is the sister who\nhas been left to look after the dying mother\n(played by Anna Wing). She is isolated,\ninfertile, morosely funny and just about\nmanages to survive on a withering marriage.\nRita (played by Gwen Taylor) is the sister who\ngot away. She uses her family and her general\nbusiness to maintain an arms-length com-passion.\nThe play does not indulge in moral gloom\nbut rather is full of humour and dignity. The\ndialogue does lack subtlety in one or two\nplaces but is nevertheless expressive about the\nunfairness of life and pokes a guilty finger at\nthose who arrive just in time for the last rites.\nA lot of the play's strength comes from its\nrecognisable realism, as such scenes are\ncontinuously being enacted all over the\ncountry.\nThe play ends mid-March and seats and\nstandbys are modestly priced.\nThe Penguin Book of Political Comics,\ncompiled by Steef Davidson, \u00a35.95.\nThis is a disappointing book for several\nreasons. First, the cartoons are so badly\nprinted that it's often difficult to read them.\nThis isn't all Penguin's fault, the original comics\nprobably weren't very well produced, but it is\nPenguin's fault that a lot of them are printed\nmuch too small. Second, roughly half of the\ncartoons are foreign (Steef Davidson is Dutch)\nwith footnotes providing a translation, but\nthey're tiresome to read. Third, too much\nspace is taken up by Steef Davidson's generally boring and pretentious commentaries\nHe takes the cartoons far too seriously and\nattaches too much significance to them,\npresumably to gratify his self-importance.\nSome of the statements he makes are silly and\npompous for example: \"....the political comic\nstrip has come into its own as a mature\ngenre the political press follows the general\npattern of visually oriented culture, which in\nturn reflects the social conditions under which\nwe live.\" Davidson has unfortunately assumed\nthat people will be as interested in the history\nand ideology of the cartoons as they will be in\nthe cartoons themselves. So there are pages\nand pages telling you what the Federation des\nEtudiants Revolutionnaires was doing in 1968\nand so on, all boring. The only interesting\npiece is an account of the birth of the Comics\nCode Authority, set up in 1959 by the\nAmerican comics industry to appease the\nMcCarthyites.\nThe cartoons themselves are a very varied\ncollection, going from 1913 (anti-strike\nbreaking) to 1975 (fall of Portuguese\ndictatorship).\nAccording to Davidson....\"comic strips are\nan ideal medium for the spreading of ideas \"\nbut it depends what you mean by 'ideas'.\nNearly all the cartoons are crude propaganda,\nthe only idea they try to spread is merely 'we\nare absolutely right and our enemies are\nwrong'. (Most of the 'baddies' are shown as\nlooking ugly and sinister, while the 'goodies'\nalways look handsome and intelligent.)\nVery few of the cartoons are designed to make\nyou think. The title of one cartoon sums up the\natmosphere of the book: \"Donald Duck: The\ntruth the bourgeois comics have repressed'.\nIt's a sort of Death-to-Imperialists ideology\nlightened with some self-parody. On the whole\nthe book is poor, with too few good cartoons\n(like one by Ron Cobb) to break the\nmonotony. N. Willson\nPage 8 FELIX, February 26, 1982\n\n"

So if you want\nto be entertained go and see them\nor read Roderick. Yours drained\nof inspiration.\nFrancesco Ragoczy and the\nCollector\nDesign for\nSocial Need\nIt can be argued that all design for industry is (or should be) design for\nsocial need, but in practice there are many real social needs which are\nnot adequately met by private industry or state agencies. These needs\ninclude many aspects of design for the disabled, the elderly and infirm,\nand design for Third World needs. Able-bodied people in 'affluent'\nwestern society (such as the unemployed) also have needs which can\nsometimes be met by design action.\nDesign for social need is no longer as fashionable as it once was, but\"\nhas now entered a more realistic professional stage. The speech makers and the trendy audiences have moved on and the starry-eyed idealists\nhave found that it is by no means an easy option. All the designer's technical, professional, analytical and promotional skills are required and\nstaying power is likely to be needed in full measure if designs are to be\nmanufactured in any quantity at a cost society can afford.\nAt the Royal College of Art there have been a number of products\nmade up whereby disadvantaged people have had their lifestyles\nsubstantially enhanced. One example is the spina bifida children's play-car. Another is a set of stretcher/trolleys for epi lect ic boys which are\noperated by the patient's own class-mates. A cheap and simple speech\ntraining aid suitable for Third World manufacture and use has been\nfavourably reported by The New Scientist. An in no cul ation kit with its\nsupporting ice maker unit which could save the lives of millions of Third\nWorld rural children won two major international awards.\nAnother outstanding project was the egg-packing scheme originally for\nZambia, but subsequently taken up by fourteen Third World nations.\nThis resulted in substantially improved nutrition for perhaps millions of\npeople. This project was initiated by the Intermediate Technology\nDevelopment Group, with product analysis, design and prototype\ndevelopment at the Royal College of Art, and machinery design by\nReading University. The machinery was developed and manufactured by\na British firm.\nA 'Design for Social Need' week with lectures by practical experts in\nthe various subject areas is held annually at the Royal College of Art, and\nthis year commences on Monday, March 8. Most of these lectures are\nopen to professional practitioners and serious students from other\nColleges.
