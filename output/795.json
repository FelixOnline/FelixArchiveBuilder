    "content": "Section 3 states \"The Secretary oi State may make grants to each\nof the funding Councils of such amounts and subject to such restrictions\nas he may determine.\"\nThis means that the Secretary of State is free to make cuts in University funding\nas and when he sees fit without anyone having any recourse to question him. It\nshould be noted that he intends to increase student numbers by 5% whilst cutting\nfunding by 126 million pounds, by the implementation of this Bill.\nIt also means that the Secretary of State is free to impose restrictions such as\n\"You shall not fund student facilities\" or \"Funding shall only take place under a system of contract funding.\" For those who don't know, contract funding which\nhas been discussed in relation to this Bill, would mean that each Department would\nhave to put in competitive tenders in an attempt to gain funding, the UFC being\nmore than likely to accept the cheapest. The first areas to be cut in an attempt\nto educate the largest number of students at the least cost would be those\nconcerning student facilities.\nAt the same time the Secretary of State is also giving himself the power to cut\nspecific departments. The Finance & Executive committees of Imperial have\nalready been under considerable pressure from Government to cut four departments\nwho are grossly overspending their budgets. These departments and their overspend\nare: Maths - \u00a3525K; Physics - \u00a3333K; Materials - \u00a3205K and Chemistry - \u00a3! 21K. If the new system was in place now the Secretary of State could cut Imperial's budget by the same amounts, whilst specifying that these Departments will not be\nfunded.\nSection (<*) states: \"Funding Councils shall comply with any directions given to\nthem by the Secretary of State.\"\n\"You shall be my puppets and I shall pay you for being so,\" says the Secretary of\nState. Enough said!\nClause 130 is summarised in this manner:\n\"Clause 130 and Schedule 9 establish a body known as the University\nCommissioners, set out considerations to which they are to have\nregard in exercising their functions, and define the institutions in\nrespect of which they are to exercise those functions.\"\nIn fact, what this is doing is setting up a body to implement the removal of job\ntenure for College staff. This would allow a university to dismiss staff for reasons\nof redundancy or \"good cause\".\nIn many ways something of this nature has been needed for some time as there\nare quite a number of people who work for College to do very little and get paid\na lot because they have job tenure and know they can get away with it. This\nlack of commitment to the job has meant it is nearly impossible to run an\nefficient institution as someone is always going to mess it up.\nUnfortunately, this clause also provides the machinery for the dismissal of any\nmember of staff who simply does not agree with the system, or as a way of saving\nmoney. The reason for this is that we do not know that the commissioners are\ngoing \"to apply the principles of justice and fairness\", (whatever that may mean\nfrom the Government's viewpoint) as stated in Section 2(b) of Clause 130, simply\nbecause they are selected by the Secretary of State. It is not reasonable for us\nto trust the Secretary of State, as he has proven by the way he is trying to push\nthis Bill through with very little consultation, that he is untrustworthy.\nWe would be far happier with Clause 130 if the commissioners were appointed by\nthe Privy Council or an independent academic board.\nThere is very little doubt that this Bill in its present form poses a fundamental\nthreat to University and Student Union funding and autonomy. This is in many\nways a great shame as a shift in the education system towards Science and\nTechnology has to be beneficial to this country and this Bill actually proposes to\ndo that.\nUnfortunately, so little time has been allowed for ironing out the flaws in the Bill\nthat we must protest now in order to secure the future of student facilities.\nAn attempt has been made to give each Departmental academic year the option of\njoining in any protest and it was decided that Imperial College Union should act in\na manner independent of the NUS. Hence, each set is to be asked if it will support\na half-day abstention from lectures on Tuesday, March Ist, between 10.30 a.m. and\n4.30 p.m., the time when Association of Universities Teachers, your lecturers, are\naiming to lobby Parliament.\nGive your lecturers the opportunity to exercise their right to lobby Parliament.\nAbsent yourselves from the lectures they are not allowed to cancel. At the same\ntime, support the AUT and this document by taking this simple action. It's not a lot to ask in order to defend 40 years of an education system, the future of\nyour department and student facilities.\nSYDNEY HARBOUR-BRIDGE\nPresident\nImperial College Union 25 February 1988\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWill academic reps please remember to inform\nif their set has voted to abstain from lectures.\nIf you have any problems please contact the Union\n\n"

    "content": "Features\n'up yours' interpretation. In most\nparts of Europe, however, this palm\nfacing in version means 'victory'.\nThis signal also means the number\ntwo. The insulted Spaniard serving\nbehind a bar could respond by giving\nthe Brit two pints of beer!\nThere are many other simpler\ngestures which can be misinterpreted\nand can cause embarrassing results.\nAll the gestures I have pointed out are\ngiven the British interpretation.\nOne of the mistakes that can be\nmade in understanding body language\nis to interpret as a solitary gesture\nrather than as part of a cluster.\nScratching the head could mean any\nnumber of things: fleas, dandruff,\nuncertainty, forgetfulness or lying.\nIn addition to looking for gesture\nclusters and congruence of speech and\nbody movement, all gestures should\nbe considered in the context in which\nthey occur. For instance, if a person\nwere huddled at a train station we\ncould rightly assume that they were\ncold. If they struck the same position\nin a warm house then we could\ninterpret this as a defensive position.\nFaking\nIt's no use trying to fake your body\nlanguage because you will also,\nsub con cio us ly, give out micro signals that you are a faker. The pupils may\ncontract, one eyebrow may lift or\nsome part of the body may twitch.\nThe result is that the receiver tends\nnot to believe you.\nThe human mind knows when it is\nreceiving in congruent non-verbal\nmessages. However, some people\nhave got faking off to an art.\nPoliticians are very good examples.\nThey are very good at using body\nlanguage to persuade people to vote\nfor them. Successful 'political fakers'\nare said to have 'charisma'. Beware\nof charismatic sabbatical candidates!\nThe problem with lying is that the\nsubconscious mind acts automatically\nand independently of our verbal lie.\nPeople who rarely tell lies are easily\ncaught because during a lie our body\ngives out nervous energy that shows\nup in our gestures. This is the\nprincipal on which American lie\ndetectors work. Some people whose\njobs involve lying, such as actors,\npoliticians, lawyers and sabbaticals\nhave usually refined their gestures to\nthe point where it is difficult to detect\nthe lie.\nResearch using slow motion\ncameras shows that most\nmicro gestures occur within a split\nsecond. It is only people such as\nprofessional interviewers who can\ncon cio us ly see them during a conversation.\nThe best way to lie is over the\ntelephone!\nZones\nMan, like animals, has territories.\nEvery country is a territory. People\nalso kill to protect their own territory.\nEach person has his own personal\nzone which includes the area around\nhis possessions, such as his home, his\ncar and his airspace around his body.\n(FELIX Editors have their office!)\nMost animals have their own\npersonal space. How far it extends\ndepends on how crowded the area is.\nMan's space depends on the density\nof the population in the place where\nhe grew up. This personal space is,\ntherefore, culturally determined.\n1. Intimate Space (15-46cm) Only\nthose who are emotionally close to\nthat person are permitted to enter it.\nBetween 0 and 15cm is the close\nintimate space.\n2. Personal Space (46-120cm) This\nis the distance that we stand from\nothers at parties and social gatherings.\n3. Social Space (120-360cm) This is\nthe distance for strangers.\n4. Public Space This is the\ncomfortable distance when we are\naddressing a group.\nIf a person enters our intimate zone,\nthe heart pumps faster, adrenal in pours into the bloodstream and blood\nis pumped to the brain in preparation\nfor an attack.\nThe distance that two people who\nare kissing keep their hips apart can\ntell you about the relationship\nbetween them. If their pelvises are\nwithin 15cm then they are lovers or\nenjoy a close physical relationship. If\nthe hips are more than 15cm apart\nthen they no longer enjoy a physical\nrelationship or never had one in the\nbeginning!\nCrowding\nThere are certain unwritten rules\nwhich British people follow when\ntheir intimate space is invaded\nbecause of crowding, such as in a crowded lift or train:\n1. You are not permitted to speak to\nanyone;\n2. You must avoid eye contact with\nothers;\n3. No emotion must be displayed;\n4. If you have a newspaper, you must\nappear to be deeply engrossed in it;\n5. The bigger the crowd, the less the\nbody movement you are permitted to\nmake;\n6. In lifts, you must watch the floor\nnumbers as they pass by.\nAs soon as we enter a crowded\nplace, the crowd become 'non-persons'. They do not exist and we,\ntherefore, do not respond to them.\nWhen a person claims an area\namong strangers, such as a seat in a cinema, he usually looks for the\nwidest space available between two\nothers and claims the area in the\ncentre. The purpose of this is not to\noffend the other people by being to\nclose to them.\nAn exception to this rule is the\nspacing that occurs in public toilet\ncubicles. Research shows that people\nchoose the end toilets about 90% of\nthe time, and, if they are occupied,\nthe midway principle is used.\n10 Friday 26th February 1988 FELIX\n\n"

It's not often that people show such\nappreciation of my humble efforts. I still enjoy reading FELIX anyway.\nDoes anybody else?\nStrike\nI think that one of the most sensible\nmoves that Ian Howgate has made this\nyear has been to suggest that\nindividual lecture groups vote to take\naction. Having taken part in the last\njoint AUT/ICU/NALGO action in\nJanuary 1986, which failed due to\nlack of student/lecturer support, I can\nonly applaud next week's method of\naction. It is important that we don't sit back and ignore the Union's call\nnext Tuesday just because the\nEducation Reform Bill will benefit\nscience. The strike has been called to\npoint out that we, as intelligent\nthinkers, do not want the Government\nto control what we learn and how we\nare to be taught. Nor do we want to\nstifle art and all that is creative just\nbecause the Government doesn't believe it has relevance in the 1990s. If you do go on strike next\nTuesday, don't just treat it as a day\noff. Lobby Parliament or attend the\nNUS rally on Saturday. Get off your\nbacksides and do something radical\nfor a change!\nI also hope that the Union's action\ndoesn't stop after Tuesday but that\nboth Ian and Neil Motteram, ICU's External Affairs Officer, organise\nmore events to highlight our concern\nabout GERBILL. I still like the\nRector's idea of staging a work-in.\nStrikes are very negative and tend to\naggravate the situation. I'm sure we'd achieve much greater press coverage\nif we did something slightly different\nin protest.\nReviews Editor\nCharles Robin, who has been our\nReviews Editor this term, has decided\nto leave College and has resigned\nfrom his post. This has left the post\nvacant. Four people have already\ndropped in to the office to ask about\nthe job. Would they and anybody else\nwho fancies writing \"the occasional\nreview please drop into the FELIX\nOffice at 12.45pm today when I will\nbe holding a special reviewers\nmeeting.\nManifestos\nNext week's FELIX is possibly one\nof the most important issues of the\nyear: the manifestos issue. It will\nexplain the Union's version of the\nSingle Transferable Vote System and\ncontain the manifestos of all the\nstudents standing in the sabbatical\nelections. Don't miss it as it's your\nUnion's future!\nFor any potential sabbaticals out\nthere, the deadline for the manifestos\nissue is 9.30am on Monday 29th February. The maximum number of\nwords for a manifesto is 300; overlong manifestos will be cut at the\n300th word. No manifestos will be\naccepted after 9.30am. FELIX will\nprint copy exactly as it is submitted.\nAll candidates should ensure that their\nspelling, grammar, etc, is correct.\nPhotographs will be printed with\nmanifestos if delivered on time.\nHeroes\nI would like to take this opportunity\nto thank all my staff who rallied\naround me on Monday and Tuesday\nwhen Rose Atkins, our typesetter,\nwent down with a mysterious virus\nand on Wednesday when the printing\npress broke down again. I want also\nto thank both Rose and Dean, the\nprinter, for their dedication. Dean has\nbeen fighting the 'flu all week. It's no\nmean feat operating the press with a full-scale headache. Most printers\nwould not have bothered but Dean's a printer in a million!!\nPrint Unit's Future\nHas the Print Unit a future after all\nthe criticism it's been getting\nrecently? Certainly when my\nsabbatical was created both FELIX's and the Print Unit's work were a lot\nsmaller than in 1988. For the past\nmonth we have been holding a working party to discuss the FELIX\nEditor's job description and the future\nof the Print Unit. Perhaps it is time\nto split the Editor and Print Unit\nManager. We will be having a final\nmeeting of the working party at 1pm today in the FELIX Office and\nhopefully come up with a few\ndecisions. Anybody who feels that\nthey can suggest anything useful to\nthis party is welcome to attend\u2014and\nthat includes any of my fans in\nMopsoc or Astrosoc.\nMore Staff\nFELIX can never have too many\nstaff. The more input there is, the\nbetter the paper. The easiest ways to\ncontribute are by either writing a feature on something you care\npassionately about or by turning up\non Thursday nights to collate the\npaper (that's putting the sheets\ntogether). Collation was how I got\ninvolved but I'm a bit sick of it now.\nI don't think I'm a dictator, as is\nsuggested on the letters page, just a bit eccentric.

The rag\nmag, which looks like a glossy\nmagazine and is printed in full colour,\nis being sold for \u00a31 a copy. The mag\nhas been produced and distributed by\na group calling themselves London\nRag Chairman Nigel Baker first\nheard of the group last Thursday\nwhen he was trying to sell Imperial\nCollege rag mags in the Goose and\nFirkin pub. Nobody was willing to\nbuy them because they had already\nbeen sold a London rag mag earlier\nin the evening. Mr Baker became j suspicious of the rag mag because he\nhad never heard of a London wide\ncharity fund raising organisation and\nthe telephone numbers given in the\nmagazine were unobtainable.\nThe next day the magazines were\nbeing sold outside Beit Quadrangle.\nMr Baker decided to contact the\ncharity named by London Rag 88,\nIntermediate Technology, which is an\norganisation trying to help the Third\nWorld to help itself. The Appeals\nOrganiser knew of the mag but did\nnot know about the group behind it.\nMr Baker also rang several of the\nadvertisers to point out that Imperial\nRag, the largest rag in London, was\nnot connected with the venture.\nOn Wednesday Mr Baker was\nthreatened with an injunction by\nLondon Rag 88 in order to stop him\ntelephoning the advertisers or the\npress. They claim that advertising\nworth \u00a34000 may be lost already due\nto Mr Baker's action.\nMr Baker told FELIX last night that\nhe believed a London wide rag was\nThe offending rag magazine\na good idea but that this group had\ngone about it the wrong way. They\nwere paying people to sell the rag mag\nand the public were buying it because\nthey thought that it was a glossy\nstudent rag mag and all the money\nwas going to charity. He also doesn't believe that rag should be politic is ed: the magazine contains an article about\nthe Green Party and several adverts\nfor political campaigns. He has asked\nLondon Rag to place an insert in each\nmagazine pointing out that they are\nnot connected with any College rags.\nHe feels their efforts will jeo pardi se any sponsorship or advertising that IC\nRag tries to obtain in the future.\nA meeting has been organised\nbetween London Rag 88 and all\nLondon College rags for next\nMonday, when Mr Baker hopes that\nthe whole situation will be sorted out.\nShanley drops out of race\nPresidential candidate Paul Shanley\nhas withdrawn from the Sabbatical's race leaving Nigel D Baker (Chem\nEng) proposed by John Noble, as the\nonly fully proposed candidate for the\npost.\nSteve Mercer (Physics), proposed\nby Max Kallios; and Chas Brereton\n(Life Sciences), proposed by Amin\nEl-Kholy are the only candidates so\nfar for the post of Deputy President\nwhile Ian Morris (Civ Eng), proposed\nby Alan Hepper; and Roger Houghton\n(Maths), un proposed so far, are\nstanding for Honorary Secretary\n(Events).\nThere are three candidates so far for\nthe post of FELIX Editor/Print Unit\nManager.

    "content": "Features\nBody\nSpecifics\nCrossed Arms and Legs\nThis gesture is a signal that a negative\nor defensive attitude exists, crossing\nthe arms on the chest was originally\nintended to defend the heart and\nbreasts. Crossing the legs is an\nattempt to shield the genitals.\nLeg Clamping\nA person who adopts a Figure 4\nposition with the right leg resting on\nthe left knee with the hands clamped\non the right shin is showing that he\nis a tough-minded, stubborn\nindividual.\nPalms\nThe open palm has been associated\nwith truth, honesty and submission.\nOaths are taken with palm on the heart\nor held visibly in the air as in a court\nof law. One way of discovering\nwhether someone is being honest is\nto look for palm displays.\nEye Rubbing\nThis gesture is the brain's attempt to\nblock out the deceit, doubt or lie that\nit sees, or to avoid having to look at\nthe face of the person to whom he is\ntelling the lie.\nFingers in the Mouth\nThis occurs usually when the person\nis under pressure. It is an unc on cio us attempt to revert to the security of the\nchild sucking on his mother's breast.\nThis gesture is an outward\nmanifestation of an inner need for\nreassurance.\nCheek and Chin\nA good personal tutor knows when\nhis students are interested in the\ntutorial. When the student begins to\nuse his hand to support his head, it\nis a signal that boredom has set in.\nThe degree of boredom is related to\nthe extent to which his arm and hand\nare supporting. The ultimate boredom\nsignal is when the head is on the table\nand the person is snoring!\nEvaluation is shown by a closed\nhand resting on the cheek, often with\nIP the index finger pointing upwards.\nShould the person begin to lose\ninterest but wish to appear interested,\nthe position will alter slightly so that\nthe heel of the palm supports the head.\nGenuine interest is shown when the\nhand is on the cheek, not used as a head support.\nThe chin-stroking gesture is the\nsignal that the listener is making a decision.\nHands Behind Head\nThis gesture is used by a 'know it all'\nindividual and many people find it\nirritating when someone does it to\nthem. It is typical of professional\npeople or people who are feeling\nconfident or dominant.\nHands on Hips\nThis indicates an aggressive attitude.\nHumans use this gesture to make\nthemselves appear bigger. Males will\nuse it as a non-verbal challenge to\nother males who enter their territory.\nIt can also be interpreted as a 'ready-for-action' gesture.\nThe aggressive-readiness poses are\nused by professional models to give\nthe impression that their clothing is\nfor the modern, forward-thinking\nwoman.\nSexual Aggressiveness\nThumbs tucked into the tops of the\npockets is an act of sexual\naggressiveness. The hands highlight\nthe genital region. Men use this\ngesture to stake their territory or in\nthe presence of females to say 'I'm virile and I can dominate you'.\nThis gesture, combined with\nexpanded pupils and one foot pointing\ntowards a female, can be easily\ndecoded by most women. Women\nwho prefer wearing trousers are\nusually those who are sexually\na gres sive and like to make decisions.\nHence the old saying: 'the one who\nwears the trousers' in a household.\nPlaying with Purple Fluff\nThis usually indicates an insecurity or\nan intent to stop biting the nails. Most\npeople find this habit intensely\nirritating.\nEyes\nEye contact is probably the most\nimportant sort of non-verbal\ncommunication because eyes are a focal point of the body and the pupils\nwork independently.\nThe pupils will dilate or contract as\nthe person's attitude and mood change\nfrom positive to negative and vice\n0\n\u00ae\nversa. When someone becomes\nexcited, his pupils can dilate up to\nfour times their normal size. An angry\nmood can cause the pupils to contract.\nYoung lovers will look into each\nother's eyes, unknowingly looking for\ndilation. Pornographic images cause\npupils to dilate by three times their\nnormal amount.\nTests conducted recently showed\nthat expert card players played less\nwell if their opponents wore dark\nglasses. Scientists put this down to the\nfact that the opponent's eyes would\ndilate if they had a good hand so the\nexpert would know that he shouldn't bet on the hand.\nTerritorial Gestures\nPeople lean against other people or\nobjects to show a territorial claim.\nLeaning can also be used as a method\nof dominance or intimidation when\nthe object being leaned on belongs to\nsomeone else.\nConclusion\nPeople form 90% of their opinion\nabout you in the first 90 seconds of\nmeeting you, and you never get a second chance to make a first\nimpression! So, you better get\npractising your gestures now , before\nyou turn too many people off!\nNEXT WEEK: Courtship gestures\u2014\nor how to pull the birds.\nFELIX Friday 26th February 1988 11\n\n"

Having\nalready beaten weak teams in their last\ntwo games, SOP (3-0) amd New III\n(5-1), IC struggled to find their ry th m against another. Only playing 35 mins\neach way because the ref had to go\nback to work, left IC thankful on an\nenergy sapping pitch. Despite this\npoor start, it was IC who dominated,\nand it wasn't long before the goals\nbegan to fly. Guy Phiri opened the\nscoring, Alan Glass powered two and\nPip Peel made it four by half time.\nAfter the switch, IC continued, except\nthe goals weren't so forthcoming.\nAlan Glass completed a fine hattrick\nto make it 5-0, and then the day was\nspoilt as QMC scrambled a lucky\ngoal. Mark Woodgate came close\nwith some fine headers, Micky\nPlumber also nearly scored and Guy\nPhiri was off-side, before Guy\nsneaked the sixth goal. A tough\ndisplay from IC, from Andy Allen in\ngoal, Russ Dark and Chris Burton in\ndefence through to Ed Coates, Chris\nMorris and Darren Bolland in\nmidfield. With 25 points from 14\ngames, IC look to be certain\nchampions.\nImpressive 3rds IC III\u20149\nMXUC II\u20140\nThe 3rds continued their league\nrevival with an impressive win against\nbottom-of-the-table MX UC. The\ngoals began right from the start, Dave\nClarke made a good run down the\nright and Neil Lennard headed home,\nthen skipper Kev Graves scored two\nin quick succession, both from\ncorners.

Thanks go to\nDave Clarke, Alan Sinclair and Jerry\nEdmonds who made their debuts and\nwatch out seconds, your title isn't safe\nyet.\nHell hath no fury...\nDear FELDC,\nThere is no place for women in IC's Boat Club. This\nwas proven to be the case at the weekend when Imperial\nCollege Boat Club, correction, the male members of the\nBoat Club, competed at Burway Head of the River.\nThe women's Senior C IV, who have been training\nrigorously throughout the Winter, arrived at Burway last\nSaturday to be informed by the Club Captain that their\nboat had been deliberately left behind at Putney. The\nreason given was that there was insufficient space on the\ntrailer for all boats; and it had therefore been decided,\nin their absence, that the women's boat should be left\nbehind.\nDid Imperial really expect their female members to\ncompete without a boat? Of course not, the Club Captain\noffered an alternative boat, although this was felt to be\nonly as a token gesture. The women's crew were given\nthe 'honour' of sharing one of the Top Squad's boats; a boat which the girls are normally not even allowed to\npractise in because it is considered too 'good' for them.\nBuilt and rigged purposely for its 14 stone male crew,\nit was clearly totally incompatible for any other crew, least\na women's crew, and under the circumstances a total waste\nof time racing in it.\nUnfortunately this is only one example of the\nchauvinistic attitude that now prevails within the Boat\nClub. At present the women members of the Boat Club\nare given the lowest priority irrespective of their\ncommitment and achievements. The Senoir C IV who\nshould have raced last Saturday, three members of which\ncame second in their division at the IV's Head this season,\nhave been forced to practise in an old, twisted wooden\nboat and to compete in boats that the Boatman Bill Mason\nhas kindly managed to borrow from other clubs. In\ncontrast, Novice men's crews, who train less often and\nare less experienced, have been allocated, it seems\nautomatically, comparatively race worthy fibreglass boats. Clearly, there are certain members of the IC Boat Club\nwho are not benefitting from the money that the Union\nis putting into the Club. In its present state, the women\nmembers of the Club feel they have no alternative but to\njoin a different rowing club. At a time when Imperial is\nactively trying to encourage women to join the College\nI think that it is important that College is made aware of\nthe situation which currently exists within one of its\ncostliest and most prominent clubs.\nYours sincerely,\nMandy Phillips, ME3\nLadies' Boat Club Captain\nCopies to: Mr John Smith, College Secretary\nSydney Harbour Bridge, Union President\nRobert Gee, Boat Club Captain\nMr Gee would like me to ask any ladies to see him so\nthat he can discuss the situation with them. He is very\nanxious that things should be sorted out between the\nmen and the ladies.\nMisguided tories\nDear Ms Hackney,\nOn coming into College on the morning of Tuesday 16thI spied a poster reading 'Hitler had a no-platform policy\nas well\u2014the Conservatives protect free speech'.\nI had to ask myself if this was a joke perpetrated by\nan opposition group, a sick attempt at humour from IC\nConservative Society, or a sadly misguided though\nsincerely felt opinion.\nLike many others I laughed to myself as I tried to\nreconcile this statement with the facts of the seven-year\nThatcher tyranny as I know them.\nWe are talking about a government who has 'lost'\nimportant documents concerning the sinking of the\nArgentine ship 'Belgrano', who have, in their go ulis h guise\nas Norman Tebbit, tried to dictate broadcasting policy to\nthe British institution the BBC. We are talking about a government who lost two ministers during the shady saga\nof 'Westlands'\u2014both who left of their own accord as they\nfelt they could no longer take part in the covert dealings.\nWe are talking about a government who have recently\nwasted millions of pounds of taxpayers' money in a futile\nand embarrassing attempt to bar 'Spy Catcher' which\ndocuments highly controversial material about underhand\ndealings of the security forces against the Wilson\ngovernment.\nWe are talking about a government that will not allow\nus, the public, to hear Mr John Stalker's evidence in the\nalleged RUC 'shoot to kill' policy and of a leader who\nquickly stifles any di sent ing voices in her cabinet by\nmysteriously reshuffling.\nWe are talking about a Prime Minister who justifies\ndenying public access to potentially embarrassing topics\nby using the catch-all phrase of 'not in the public interest'\nand hoping that will justify the public and the media.\nThis is a government whose youth wing, the Young\nConservatives stifle speeches by the Federation of\nConservative Students, some of whose members illustrate\nthe hard right reality that underscores their actions.\nI had to laugh as I considered that this poster related\nto a government who refused to sanction a Freedom of\nInformation Act.\nI am both angry and sympathetic to the poor fools who\ntake these posters seriously and I think it will take a miracle\nif the Tories don't try to censor this letter before it reaches\nprint.\nI am all for free speech but when will the government\nbe?\nYours in sincerity,\nMatthew Salter (Chem 1).\nHell hath no fury II\nDear Judith,\nYou may have been confused so far by the\ncorrespondence coming from Tizard Hall. Until now we\nhave been sworn to secrecy about the bizarre goings on\nin the hall, under threat of having to spend an evening\nwith these three notoriously interesting people\u2014Dracula\nJ, Grumph and Ken McC. Well, I am now daring to break\nthe silence and tell all.\nThe truth of the matter is that they are involved in a love triangle and these 'incoherent muttering s' are in fact\ncodes, arranging meetings for their secret society 'Radio\nBonk', (they have obviously misunderstood the meaning\nof 'Sachs in the Afteroon' on Capital).\nThey were quite happy until Grumph had an affair with\nhis teddy bear and, although he pleaded that it didn't mean\nanything, the bitching started. (Hell hath no fury like a fag scorned!)\nThis brings me onto the question of why girls in Tizard\nHall are single. The boys are obviously far too busy\nplaying with pen and paper to play with the girls.\nBut don't despair, there are some real men out there.\nLove, The Shark.\nFELIX Friday 26th February 1988 17\n\n"

Twentythree of these were un justifiably executed.

    "content": "More human\ncommunication\ntakes place by the\nuse of gestures,\npostures, position\nand distances than\nby any other\nmethod. Non-verbal\ncommunication is a complex process\ninvolving people,\nwords, tone of\nvoice and body\nmovements. This\nspecial FELIX\nfeature examines\neach component of\nbody language and\ngesture, though few\ngestures are made\nin isolation from\nothers.\nPeople have been communicating\nwith their bodies for thousands of\nyears, but it was only in the sixties\nthat scientists started to study this nonverbal communication in any great\ndetail. The most influential technical\nwork before this period was Charles\nDarwin's The Expression of the\nEmotions in Man and Animals\npublished in 1872, where Darwin\ndetailed studies of facial expressions\nand body language.\nIt was this communication skill\nwhich made silent movie actors, such\nas Charlie Chaplin, great. Each actor\nwas classed as good or bad by the\nextent to which he could use gestures\nand other body signals to\ncommunicate effectively. When\ntalking films took over, many silent\nmovie actors faded into obscurity as\nnon-verbal were superceded by verbal\nskills.\nAlbert Mehrabin has carried out\nextensive research into body\nlanguage. He has found that the total\ninput of a message is about 7%\nverbal, 38% vocal (tone of voice,\ninflection, etc.) and 55% non-verbal.\nOther researchers have estimated that\nthe average person actually speaks\nwords for a total of about ten or\neleven minutes a day and that the\naverage sentence takes only 2.5\nseconds.\nMost researchers generally agree\nthat the verbal channel is used\nprimarily for conveying information,\nwhile the non-verbal channel is used\nfor 'negotiating interpersonal\nattitudes'. Despite this, humans are\nrarely aware of their postures,\nmovements and gestures and the\nmessages they convey.\nIntuition\nTechnically, 'intuition' is a person's ability to read another's non-verbal\ncues. For instance, it is easy to tell\nwhen somebody is lying because their\nverbal and body languages do not\nagree. Another example is that of an\nImperial College lecturer and his\nstudents. If the students are sitting\nback in their seats with chins down\nand arms crossed on their chests, a perceptive lecturer would get a feeling\nthat his delivery was not getting\nacross. Hopefully, he would become\naware that he needed to take a different approach to gain audience\ninvolvement. A non-perceptive\nlecturer would carry on regardless.\n(Recent student research has shown\nthat only 5% of IC lecturers are\nperceptive.)\nWomen are generally more\nperceptive than men\u2014the so-called\n'female intuition'. They have an\naccurate eye for detail and can\ndecipher non-verbal signals better\nthan their male counterparts. This is\nwhy it is so easy for a woman to tell\nwhen her husband is lying or to pull\nthe wool over his eyes.\nGenetics or cultural?\nMost of the scientific research that has\nbeen done into body language has\nconcentrated on whether gestures are\ndetermined by our genetics or our\ncultural upbringing. The German\nscientist Eibl-Eibesfeldt found that\nsmiling expressions of children born\ndeaf and blind occur independently of\nlearning or copying, which means that\nthese must be inborn gestures.\nEkman, Friesen and Sorenson\nsupported some of Darwin's original\nbeliefs about inborn gestures when\nthey studied the facial expressions of\npeople from five very different\ncultures. They found that each culture\nused the same basic facial gestures to\nshow emotion, which led them to the\nconclusion that these gestures must be\ninborn.\nThere is still a great debate as to\nwhether some gestures are culturally\nlearned or become habitual, or are\ngenetic. Most research indicates,\nhowever, that much of our basic nonverbal behavior.is learned and the\nmeaning of many movements and\ngestures is culturally determined.\nOrigins\nMost of the basic gestures occur all\nover the world. Most nations smile\nwhen they are happy and cry when\nthey are sad. Nodding the head means\n'yes' and a shake means 'no'.\nScientists believe that these gestures\nare inborn as they are also used by\nblind people. When a baby has u~' enough milk it will turn its head away,\nseemingly shaking its head to reject\nits mother's breast.\nBaring the teeth can be traced back\nto our primitive animal past. It is\nderived from the act of attack and is\nused today to indicate anger or\nsneering.\nThe shoulder shrug is also a universal gesture showing that a person does not know or under s'\"J It is a multiple gesture with three main\nparts, exposed palms, hunched\nshoulders and raised brow.\nMisinterpretations\nSome gestures mean different things\nin different countries. The ' V sign',\nso popular in this country, carries an\nFELIX Friday 26th February 1988 9\n\n"

    "content": "Features\nOPINION\nby Steve Easter brook On Tuesday a motion was proposed\nat the Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting\ncalling for a paper\nrecycling scheme in\nCollege. While\nnobody objected to\nthis aim, the motion\nwas not accepted due\nto a procedural\nproblem, however, it\nwill be re-submitted\nto the next Union\nGeneral Meeting,\nwhere it can be\ndiscussed properly. I hope the person who\nblocked the motion\nreads this article,\nand realises that\nbefore it can be\ndiscussed again,\nnearly one thousand\nwild species will\ndisappear forever\nfrom the world!\nQ: What do you think of\nit so far?\nA: Rubbish!\nFew people would deny that recycling\nwaste is a good thing, but how many\nhave thought deeply about the issues\ninvolved? At present less than a quarter of the paper in use is recycled,\nbut there is no reason why it could not\nall be recycled. Simply recycling half\nthe paper in use in the world could\nmeet three quarters of the demand for\npaper, and free 4 million hectares of\nland from paper production. This\nwould be good news for Scotland,\nwhere plantations devoted to a single\nspecies are replacing beautiful\ncountryside, and especially good\nnews for Rainforests in Brazil which\nare being torn up at a horrifying rate.\nNone of the huge amount of paper\nused in College is recycled at present.\nAll it would take, however, is\neveryone to save up their waste paper,\nadd a little effort spent on central\ncollection, and the wastage can end.\nBut simply collecting up our waste\npaper isn't the end of the story. We\nneed to investigate the possibility of\nusing recycled paper throughout\nCollege. The Bookshop must be\npersuaded to stock recycled\nstationery. Departments must be\npersuaded to use recycled paper\nwhere possible. We need to\ninvestigate the use of recycled paper\nfor all the photocopiers and printers.\nThe only obstacles to overcome are\napathy and bureaucracy.\nIf the initial collection scheme\nproves successful, we would like to\nexamine the possibility of setting up\nour own pulping machine, and\nproducing our own paper. This will\nsave transportation costs, and could\nsave the College a large portion of it's stationery budget. The scheme could\nthen be expanded to include\nneighbouring establishments such as\nthe Natural History and Science\nmuseums.\nBut what this all rests on is the need\nfor support. Volunteers are needed to\nset up and monitor collection boxes,\nand empty them at the central\ncollection point. Ideally there should\nbe a collection box in every hall and\nhouse, and in every department.\nAreas which consume large amounts\nof paper need special attention, such\nas photocopier rooms, near\npigeonholes, and in the Felix office!!\nStart collecting right away, and\ndon't forget that cardboard,\nnewspapers and any form of paper\nshould all be saved. The only thing\nto be wary of is plastic is ed paper\u2014it\nmakes a mess of the recycling\nmachines. With your help we can\nsave the Rainforests.\nThe Rubbish Mountain\nThe problem of waste disposal is a modern problem. Where once, the\nonly things to be found on old rubbish\ntips were pieces of pottery and the odd\nsickle blade, the contents of modern\nwaste tips will endure for a long time\nto come. The archeologists of the\nfuture will know what kinds of things\nwe ate, from the plastic wrappers, and\neven the names of our shops, from the\ncarrier bags.\nIn Britain, we generate up to 75\nkilograms each of rubbish every\nmonth. The growth of this rubbish\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\u2022 Don't mix your rubbish. If you have a garden, organic kitchen\nwaste can be used as compost. Use separate bins to collect paper\n(and cardboard), and glass.\n\u2022 Boycott over-packaged products. Few products need more than\ntwo layers of wrapping. Luxury items are the worst offenders: a box of chocolates will often have as many as seven separate layers\nof packaging.\n\u2022 Buy in bulk. Bigger packets mean less waste packaging.\n\u2022 Choose returnable containers where they are available. These\nare the most effective and efficient way of re-cycling. Unfortunately\nthey have declined in number over recent years.\n\u2022 Choose natural packaging. Cardboard and paper are preferable\nto plastic, as they can easily be re-cycled. Similarly, glass bottles\nare much better than plastic.\n\u2022 Help your department to participate in re-cycling paper. Ensure\nthere is a recycling bin next to every photo-copier and printer. Offer\nto help empty them from time to time.\n\u2022 Keep a box in your office or room, for your own waste paper.\nYou'll be surprised how quickly it fills up.\n\u2022 Buy re-cycled stationary where possible. It is available in a wide\nrange of qualities, and is now even available for photocopiers!\n6 Friday 26th February 1988 FELIX\n\n"

If you are really\nconcerned that the President is not submitting reports for\nFELIX, why didn't you ask him to justify himself?\nPerhaps Mr Sydney Harbour Bridge (the late Mr Ian\nHowgate) doesn't submit reports because he doesn't like\nthe way that you snipe at him every week in both the\neditorial, and the 'Libel' page that you also write. Perhaps\nhe is too busy with other things to write a report which\nmay not be printed anyway.\nFor someone who writes 'I don't invite criticism. I invite\nconstructive debate' in their editorials, where in reality\nthe reverse is true, do they deserve the effort? I don't know\nwhat your personal vendetta is against Sydney, but I find\nit offensive and unnecessary to see it sprawled all over\nthe pages of FELIX.\nIf the cat is going to be factually incorrect, is it worth\nkeeping him free? You state that all past Presidents have\nwritten regular reports. Bullshit! Christine Taig may have\ndone a reasonably regular job, but previous Presidents like\nCarl Burgess and Ian Bull did not. Burgess' literary efforts'\nwere even left out, when submitted, by the then editor.\nThe FELIX Editor is not God. The Editor is accountable\nto the electorate in just the same way as any other\nsabbatical. An Editor for such a publication should reflect\nthe true views of ICU rather than the distorted personal\nviews that you seem to hold.\nPerhaps other people also agree, and this is why\neverybody gets three credits, to hide the fact that a lot\nof FELIX staff have drifted away under your dictatorship.\nI would hope that FELIX would aspire to being a quality\nnewspaper rather than a Sun\u2014News of the World\u2014Sunday\nSport rip off.

I report on what\nhappens and do not involve myself with its running.\nIt is not my place to question the President at Council.\nSurely as an ex-student, you should know that Tony.\n2) I do not write the Libel page, I only add space fillers\nif not enough text has been submitted to fill the two\ncolumns allocated.\n3) I would print any report Ian submitted except if it\nexpressed an opinion (hence it is not a report) or he\nsubmitted it after the Union Page had gone to press.\n4) Check your eye sight.\n5) Would you like to be my page 3 fella next week?\nOne more fan letter\nDear Judith,\nI feel I must reply concerning your bias and inaccuracies\nin your contentious reply to the letter of complaint last\nweek from MOPSOC and Astrosoc.\nYour reply gives nothing but poor excuses for bad work,\na common enough occur ance for anyone using the Print\nUnit. (There were even errors in the MOPSOC letter).\nThe Print Unit this year has not only botched this job,\nbut also work for Broadsheet, Hamsoc, the Postgrad\nProspectus covers and the Silwood tickets for RCSU to\nname but a few. For a Unit that pretends to be professional,\nI find the cavalier attitude towards paying customers and\nproducing substandard work distasteful.\nThe two societies gave you the least hassle possible and\nagreed that they would let you print their cards on the\nBalloon Club plate that you already had, although it would\ncost more. They did you a favour. The result was a bad\njob, for which they were then charged 2.6 times the\noriginal verbal estimate.\nMany clubs and organisations decide to go ahead with\nprinting on the basis of an estimate or quote supplied by\nthe Print Unit Manager, to fit in with their budgets. Since\nFELIX refuses to give written quotes for some reason,\nthey rely on the trust of a verbal quote. They are rewarded\nwith bills sent out weeks later which are then at least\ndouble those quoted. This is not only breach of trust but\nhighly dubious business practice. Standard bill differences\nfor professional printers will differ only by plus or minus\nten per cent, not an order of magnitude greater. A 'guess'\nis just not good enough.\nI will also quibble with the statement that there is no\nlabour charge in the Print Unit's 'at cost' printing. For\nthose not aware, the Unit charges for a plate, plus artwork\ncosts plus the paper, PLUS a charge for each time a sheet\nis run through the press (and this is twice if both sides\nare printed). If this latter is not a labour charge (quoted\nas 'machine time') then I don't know what is! Ink and fount\nsolutions are not that expensive!\nAs for Mr Salmons 'having changed his mind', it is\nobvious that as two clubs were involved, two people were\nresponsible for rejecting the work. Since only one of them\npicked up the job, Mr Salmons was not able to return the\ndefective cards until 9.00am the next day. At least they\ncommunicated with each other, which it is obvious that\nthe Print Unit Manager and Business Manager did not!\nFor a printing facility that likes to think it runs on\ncommercial lines, this is not good enough. Everybody\nmakes mistakes but you should be man enough to admit\nthem, and not pass the charges for your incompetence onto\nthe customer. Proper written quotes would not go amiss\neither. If you have any courage you will print this letter,\nor else it will be submitted to the CCU publications, who\ndo understand what a free press is all about.\nPublish or be damned!\nTony Spencer\n1) We have never 'pretended' to be a 'professional'\nprint unit. How can we be when the Manager is a sabbatical and most of the equipment antiquated and\ninadequate. What we do offer is cheap printing for\nclubs and societies. At least our printing is distinctive!\n2) We have never refused to give written quotes.\n3) How can we quote an accurate price for cards when\nwe don't know how much artwork the club will use\nand how much of the plate they will take up?\n4) The 'impression charge' (not 'machine time', dear)\ncovers not only ink and fount solutions but machine\nmaintenance (servicing costs us nearly \u00a32,000 pa),\nmachine depreciation, blanket wash, plate Cleaner,\ndamper cleaner, roller paste, oil, grease, anti-offset\nspray, hand cleaner, barrier cream, anti-skin spray,\nblankets, blanket revive r, dampers and paracetamol s. Thefinalone\nDear Judith,\nI'm fed up with reading people s lagging off you and\nthe Print Unit!\nIf they want perfect printing at an hour's notice, with\nsmiling jovial staff they should go to a print shop whose\nstaff are paid decent wages and who can go home at five\no 'clock and forget about work.\nPerhaps a 'real' print shop would appreciate the arrogant\ncustomers insisting on constant attention to their job but\nI doubt even they'd stand for it.\nPippa Salmon.\nFELIX Friday 26th February 1988 19\n\n"

'Excuse me, your\nmost magnificent baron-ness',\nhe said very sincerely, 'but who\nare you talking to?'\n'Oh, err..., nobody John.'\n'Yes you were, I distinctly\nheard you.'\n'OK then, I admit it. I was talking to this pet that someone gave\nme to look after.'\nDerek moved aside and showed John the small cage. Inside was\na large gerbil.\n'What on earth have you got that in here for?' said the stunned John.\n'I was given it last summer, when it was just a baby, to look after\nwhile some friends of mine, Margaret and Kenneth, went on holiday.\nThey haven't been back to collect it yet and it just keeps eating and\ngetting fatter and fatter. Now I hear that Sidney Spanker wants to\nkill it.'\n'Why should Spanker want to kill a gorgeous little creature like\nthis?', said John Secretary, putting his fingers through the bars of\nthe cage to stroke it. Unfortunately the gerbil didn't want to be stroked\nand sunk its teeth into John's finger instead.\n'Ouch, the little bastard bit me', howled John.\n'Yes, it didn't used to do that. Let me tell you the whole story. When\nI got it, it was just an ordinary gerbil, it didn't do much and didn't say much. Then after a few weeks it started to talk. First of all just\nthings like 'Hello Derek' and other niceties, but then more serious\nthings like 'Section 1, Scientists and Engineers are great, artists are\na waste of money.'\n'That's incredible', gasped John, 'have you managed to train it to\nsay anything else.'\n'Well, I managed to change section 1 to 'Scientists and Engineers\nare great, especially the ones at Cheapskate, artists are a waste of\nmoney, except electricians who play violins.' Apart from that it just\nkeeps on saying things like 'I love Kenny and Maggie and Uncle Derek\nis a cutie.'\n'So why does Sidney Spanker want to kill it?'\n'Oh, I don't know, more stupid publicity I suppose.'\n'What's he going to do?'\n'They had an extraordinary citizens' meeting and voted to go on\nstrike one day next week. They're going to gang up and try to kill\nmy gerbil, and what's more, if all the citizens go on strike then the\ntorturers will have no one to torture for the afternoon so they will\njoin the citizens.'\n'So how many will attack do you think?' asked John, who was being\nstrangely inquisitive because he knew more than Derek but liked to\nsee Derek sound impressive.\n'About three or four if they're lucky', laughed Derek, 'so we'll just\nget you, Arthur Michael, lain Bore and Rob McNorthey to mount a round the clock bodyguard on my gerbil.\nWill Spanker kill the gerbil?\nWill McNorthey put it in a QT burger?\nWill Derek get a peerage for looking after Maggie and Ken's gerbil?\nFind out in the next episode of the Baron of Cheapskate.\nLi bel\n\u2022 IT'S NICE TO SEE the IC Union\nExecutive are getting on so well.

    "content": "FOOTBALL\nWe return once more unto the league\ntrail with a couple of London derby s to offer the de cern ing neutral, but\nwith little else in what looks like a barren Saturday. My predictions were\nmostly up the spout last week, mainly\nin the lower divisions, though. All\nmatches are on Saturday 27 February\nat 3.00pm. Arsenal Vs Charlton\n(Highbury\u2014Arsenal tube)\nA London derby to kick off which\nthrows together two contrasting teams\nwith 21 points separating them.\nArsenal came through a tricky FA\nCup tie last week against Man Utd,\ndue to the fact that Mr McClair\nthough he was taking a Rugby\npenalty. Paul Davis is due back for\nArsenal and they look a strong outfit\nnow. Charlton had a great victory last\nweek, their first this year, and only\ntheir 5th league win all season. They\nare off the bottom, but their is a long\nway to go yet if they are to survive.\nGarth Crooks is back in form and\ncould cause Arsenal a few problems,\nbut an Arsenal win seems the sensible\nresult to expect.\nQPR Vs Wimbledon\n(Loftus Rd\u2014White City Tube)\nYet another game between two near\nneighbours (a pity Charlene won't be\nin it!) in London. Rangers drew in the\nCup last week (replay two days ago)\nand still in the top six of the division\nwith a strong home record to boast.\nThe Dons are seventh and after a tremendous victory last week, helped\nby Vinny 'Grab Your Nuts' Jones,\nover Newcasde in the Cup, they must\nbe confident of a good result here.\nWimbledon were my tip for the cup\nat the beginning of the season, and\nhave not let me down at all. (A pity\nI didn't put my money where my\nmouth was). Predicting a result is not\nso easy here, so I will plump for a hard fought draw.'\nLeyton Orient Vs Wrexham\n(Brisbane Rd\u2014Leyton Tube)\nOrient had a boosting 4-1 win against\nfellow promotion chasers Cardiff last\nweek, after being 1-0 down as well.\nThey are right back in the hunt and\nFrank Clark must be a little happier\nnow. Wrexham sit at the wrong end\nof the league table and their away\nrecord seems to explain why, with\nonly 10 goals to show from 15\noutings. The O's should come out on\ntop with a comfortable win.\nGame of the Day:\nQPR Vs Wimbledon\nCrystal Palace Vs Shrewsbury\n(Selhurt Park\u2014Norwood Junction\nBR)\nPalace have a brilliant home record\nwith twelve victories already. They\nare still in the promotion race but have\nslipped behind mainly due to the\nbrilliance of Blackburn, and the\ndogger determination of Aston Villa.\nTheir rhyming s trick ers Bright and\nWright have 40 goals between them\nnow. Shrewsbury languish 4th bottom\nof the league and have a bad away\nrecord with a lack of goals. They have\nformer Villa and Blues player David\nGeddis still in the area and Bernard\nMcNally to bang home the ball from\nthe spot. If Palace play to their\npotential they should win quite easily,\nif they play badly I still can't see\nShrewsbury getting even a point.\nFulham Vs Blackpool\n(Craven Cottage\u2014Putney Bridge\nTube)\nFulham splashed egg on my face last\nweek by beating Walsall 2-0 with\nLeroy Rosenior netting one for a change. Their crowd was dismal,\nsurely well below a break-even level.\nIt lifted them up the league to a deceptively comfortable mid-table\nposition. Blackpool were unlucky not\nto reach the 5th round of the cup, a last minute Man City goal robbing\nthem.\nThey are one point and one position\nbelow Fulham (3 games in hand).\nThey have ex-Sunderland and Stoke\nman Barry Siddall inbetween the\nsticks and ex-Throstle Craig Madden\nup front. A draw is the most likely\nbe twee en two indifferent sides.\nMy Littlewoods Cup Final\nprediction:\nArsenal Vs Oxford\nMUSIC\nFirst on the agenda this week is the\nmusical extravaganza which is the\nJazz and Rock Club Hop. All the\nRock and Pop bands within College\nwill be showing their respective\ntalents. Headlining are the popular\nSchroedinger's Cat playing very\nprofessional folk-rock. Just as\ncom pet ant are The Gents, who do a lively Rock V Roll set, and Contact\nPoint who play hard rock. Maybe I don't like heavy rock, but the mighty\nCurmudgeon are pretty damn good\nand have a few surprises up their\nsleeves. I can't exactly give a totally\nunbiased view of the Mock Ducks,\nseeing as how I'm one of them, but\nwe have jokingly been described as\n\"the best thing since Sigue Sigue\nSputnick\" (thanks Tom). Oh well, it's all a bit of fun.\nIf by now you are thinking \"Oh no,\nanother I.C. Rock Night\", well think\nagain. The lovable Chance bring you\nlively pop and HiNRG, and probably\na fashion show as well! All this and\nmore in the Lower Union Lounge on\nSaturday night.\nOut in the big wide world, the crazy\nButthole Surfers play their unique\nbrand of garage to a strong following\nat ULU tonight. If you want to see\nthe Mighty Lemon Drops at the\nAstoria either tonight or tomorrow,\ngo early as they will sell out rapidly.\nI don't know about you, but I 've\nalways found it a waste of time seeing\nthem live and I got nothing I couldn't get from listening from the Album\n'Tonight'.\nGig Review\nAll About Eve at Manchester\nInternational 2\nApologies for missing The Wedding\nPresent\u2014they'd sold out. I 've always\nfound All About Eve rather dull on\nrecord, consequently I knew next to\nnothing about them. I only went along\nbecause I was stuck in Manchester on\nmy own with nothing to do until I ran\ninto a couple of Goths who said they\nwere going, would I join them? I'm glad I did. The support band,\nSomething Else played a mixture of\nDoors and Kinks covers and their own\nmaterial which sounded much the\nsame; good but forgettable. All About\nEve came on, all but hidden by a sea\nof hands outstretched above crimped\nhair, and began to demonstrate why\nthey are the focus of such devotion.\nThey played brilliantly, giving a superb rendition of the album bearing\nthe groups name, plus a few\nsurprises\u2014'Paradise' being the most\nmemorable. The singer's vocal\nexcellence makes her a serious rival\nto Kate Bush. This band do not fit into\nany major musical cat a gory, but are\nprobably nearest to Pop-Goth. But\nwho cares? The worshipping fans\nshowed their deafening appreciation\nwhich should elevate them to the\ndizzy heights reached by The Cure.\nSee them next week at the Astoria!\nPhil\nRACING\nAll you eagle-eyed punters who\nspotted the misprint\u2014my fault, not\nFELIX\u2014in last week's racing\nselections probably wished you'd have kept your eyes shut.\nI picked Slalom to win the 1.30 at\nChepstow but put down Friday\ninstead of Saturday. As it happened,\nwhen Michael Robinson's horse did\nrun the next day, he came a diss appointing third to Sir Blake by\nsome three and three-quarter lengths.\nThere was no way that Slalom could\ngive any more after being hampered\nby Sir Blake and second-placed Rusde\non the home straight. After a stewards\nenquiry, the result stood. If you blew\nsome of your hard earned grant on\nSlalom, spare a thought for the punter\nwho laid \u00a35OOO \u00a355O0 on him at\nChepstow!\nMy other blunder of last weekend,\nexcluding the now-familiar non-runners, was backing the Maid of\nMoney tip win at Navan on Saturday.\nShe just missed out when beaten by\na length and a half from Galmoy.\nPunters who took her each way aK>-l deserve a pat on the back.\nPlayschool could well enter the\nCheltenham Gold Cup on March 17th at evens, 6-4 at the most. Ante-post\nbackers might be as well to take 4-1\nbeing offered by all the High Street\nbookies. This is looking more\nattractive day by day with Burrough\nHill Lad and Cavvies Clown still\nlooking doubtful. In the Daily\nExpress Triumph Hurdle on the same\nday, Young Snugfit is still looking a good each way prospect at 25-1. The\nprice can only go down. My advice\nis to move quick on that one.\nA spy of mine with contacts at\nDavid Elswoth's stable informs me of\na cert running at Cheltenham in\nMarch. I'm so confident on him that\nI 'll be risking a pony each way on the\nnag in question\u2014but fear not! FELIX\nreaders will not go uninformed.\nWatch this space nearer the Festival\nfor details.\nCheck out the news page for this\nweek's selections.\n12 Friday 26th February 1988 FELIX\n\n"

Any amendments need to be\nmade before around 8 March.\nAlready the Government have backed\ndown on some proposals; they have\nindicated that they do not intend to\nNUS Protest outside Parliament\nImperial College, in the middle of one\nof the most expensive areas in the\ncountry, has a clear disadvantage in\nthese competitions, with the staff\ncosts and overheads significantly\nhigher than a competing College\noutside London.\nWhat's Missing\nWe all know that one of the biggest\nproblems facing students today is the\nlevel of the Grant they receive. This\nisn't even mentioned in the Bill. At\nthe moment the Minister for\nEducation, Robert Jackson (who was\nat Imperial on 15 February and is\nfeatured on the front cover of the\nCollege magazine, Network, this\nweek), is reviewing student financial\nsupport, as it is known. This review,\nit is widely rumoured, is going to\npropose the introduction of student\nloans. This is despite evidence from\noverseas, where the introduction of\nloans has resulted in higher costs for\nthe education system as a whole and\nwhere it has deterred students from\nentering higher education.\nThere is no commit t ment to the\nprinciple of 'education for all', no\nconcessions to help the disadvantaged\nor poor. What we need is a high\nquality education system available to\nall members of our society, not a narrow system based on industrial\ninterfere with the way that the UFC\nproposes to distribute funding. This\nis mainly due to the Higher Education\nlobby in the House of Lords, they do\nnot rule out, however, the\nintroduction of contract funding or\nother alternatives that will have\nsimilar or worse effects. This does\nshow, however, that they will bow to\npressure for change if they are forced.\nIn Conclusion\nAlthough presented as a change in the\nway that the Universities are funded,\nthe GERBILL gives the Secretary of\nState for Education (who may well be\nLabour in the future\u2014a fact some\nsenior Tories are very concerned\nabout) the power to decide, to a very\nlarge degree, exactly where money is\nspent and therefore exactly what is\ntaught, when it is taught and by\nwhom. This, combined with the\ncurrent Government policies for\nhigher education and the lack of any\nmore cash, constitutes the greatest\nattack on the universities since they\nwere set up.\nThe timescale for the GERBILL is\ngeared towards getting the new\nsystem well established by the next\nelection, so that a future Government\nwould not be able to reverse such\nmajor changes so soon. The system\nthat is set up now will last another ten\nor twenty years and it is important to\nget it right. Despite this, the\nopportunity for consultation and\ndebate has been tiny. The Bill is into\nits third reading, after only being\nintroduced last summer. The latest\nconsultation period has been only two\nmonths, where normal bills have\nperiods of 6 months or more. The\nreaction has been so great that even\nin this time, over 15,000 replies have\nbeen received.\nWhat can we do about it?\nAt the Imperial College Union\nGeneral Meeting last Tuesday, the\nUnion voted not to attend the National\nUnion of Students (NUS) rally in\nCentral London tomorrow; they felt\na seperate campaign would have more\nimpact and influence on the\nGovernment. Imperial students are\nstill welcome on the march, under the\nUniversity of London Union banner.\nIt starts at midday at Embankment\ntube, and the rally is afterwards at\n3.00pm in Hyde Park.\nThe Union instead decided to ask\neach year group to hold a half day\nstrike on Tuesday 1 March, from\n11.00am to 4.30pm, to coincide with\nthe AUT lobby of Parliament.

The motion, proposed by\nICU External Affairs Officer, Neil Motteram, called for student\nsupport for the AUT (Association of University Teachers) and TUC\nlobby of Parliament in opposition to the Government's Education\nReform Bill (GERBILL).\nBallots are currently underway on a departmental year basis, on the\nunderstanding that a class majority\nwill result in the cancellation of all\ntheir lectures, labs and tutorials from\nEngineering 2 & 3 and Computing 2\nare in favour of taking strike action\non Tuesday. Only Mechanical\nEngineering 2 and MRE 3 have\ndecided not to strike and both MRE\nExternal Affairs Officer Neil Motteram co-ordinating the GERBIL challenge\n11am to 4.30pm. In this way AUT\nmembers will be free to attend the\nprotest, which ICU students are also\nbeing asked to support. By yesterday\nafternoon 18 lecture classes had been\npolled. Life Sciences 1 & 2,\nBiotechnology 3, Mathematics 1,\nChemistry 1 & 2, Physics 1 & 2, Civil\nEngineering 1, Aeronautical\nEngineering 1 & 2, Chemical\n1 and Geology 1 have delayed making\na decision until they receive more\ninformation on what they are\nsupposed to be striking about.\nThe last time that ICU protested\nagainst Government education policy\nwas in January 1986, when the Union\nsupported the AUT on its stance\nagainst cuts in higher education\nfunding. Although the AUT received\nnational press coverage on this\noccasion, the ICU strike was not well\nsupported, and it is hoped that the\ndepartmental voting will encourage\nstudent support.\nICU voted in favour of this\nindependent action rather than take\npart in the NUS/TUC rally in Hyde\nPark tomorrow (Saturday). Mr\nMotteram, who was recently no-confidence d and then re-elected as\nExternal Affairs Officer, believes\nsuch a stance is important as Imperial\nCollege has much to gain from the\nBill: in particular through the change\nin emphasis from arts and humanities\nto science and engineering the\nproposed University Funding Council\n(UFC) will create. He considers the\nincreased powers of the Secretary of\nState to be of particular concern,\nalong with the power of the UFC to\nspecify exactly how funds are spent.\nNUS rally\nThe National Union of Students is\nholding a national demonstration\nsupported by the Trades Union\nCongress against the Education\nReform Bill tomorrow. Students are\nasked to assemble on the\nEmbankment at 12 noon and march\nto Hyde Park for 3pm where there\nwill be a rally.

Well they don't sound\ndissimilar to McCartney, Miracle\nLegion, R.E.M. with a bit\nManchester's finest\u2014The Smiths\nthrown in for good measure.\nFor the m easley sum of a quid, (and\naS. A.

Brad Blundell\nmusic\nLetter from St Mary's Last week saw what was arguably the\nmost cultural event at St. Mary's for\na long time, certainly since I have had\nthe pleasure to reside here. Our\nDramatic Society staged a production\nof Will Shakespeare's Twelfth Night\n(or What You Will).\nIt is extremely difficult to carry off\nsuch an ambitious project at the\nMedical School with the style\nrequired. The emphasis in recreation\nhere is fun with a capital 'F', hence\nthe temperance of artistic drive and\nrealism developing to the ideal choice\nof Twelfth Night.\nFirst performed in the Middle\nTemple on 2nd February 1602 -Candlemas Day, the play was\ndesigned to be part of the winter\nfeasting, extending from St.\nAndrew's Day to Shrovetide. The\nplay is a comedy, but carries a serious\nsocial message, and is full of\ncontemporary comment.\nIt seems a shame to individual is e such a production, but certain names\nmust be mentioned. Jane Jones as\nViola was superb. Her sense of\ntiming, the delivery of lines, the\ncreation of the correct atmosphere and\ngeneral stage presence were\nexemplary. The drunken duo of Sir\nToby and Sir Andrew exploited fully\nthe potential of the situation, carefully\nresisting the temptation to produce a complete farce. For this, praise must\nbe directed to Simon Edwards and\nJames Froner respectively.\nAnna Parns played the fool\nexquisitely mixing the comedy of the\npart with the underlying serious\nmessage often ignored in this play.\nRichard Thomas as Orsino, David\nLavalette as Sebastian and David\nKetchin as Antonio all gave credible\nperformances.\nMalvolio, the pompous puritan,\nservant of Olivia who has gre vio us wrong done to him by Fabian, Maria,\nSir Toby and Sir Andrew gave Julian\nCooper the part to exercise and stretch\nhis talent to fill the demanding role.\nHe lived up to expectations delivering\na stimulating performance.\nThe actors were well dressed in\nprimary colours, and the staging in\nthe form of an enchanted garden with\na hexagonal seat around a tree as the\ncentre piece provided a visually\ninteresting set, without overpowering\nthe acting.\"The lighting was simple\nand functional, in keeping with the\nproduction ethos.\nIn conclusion, Barns Morrice (the\ndirector) and Kat Cooper (the\nproducer) have managed to give the\nMedical School a cultural injection of\nwhich we can all be proud, being as\ngood a production ever to be seen by\nan amateur group, certainly the best\nthing done here for a long while.\nOn a totally different topic, just to\ninform you that St. Mary's mens\nhockey team beat IC l sts in the\nquarter finals of the ULU cup three\nweeks ago, by a significant margin.\nRed Hot Chilli Peppers\nThe Red Hot Chilli Peppers have\nreceived a tremendous amount of\npress recently due to their unusual\nstage costumes: the entire group play\ntheir set wearing one white sock each,\nand nothing more. (No, they don't wear them on their feet!). The\ngimmick certainly worked because\nit's got such mags as ID and The Face\ninterested in them and curious females\nturning up to their UK gigs. They\nrecently played the Clarendon in\nHammersmith to packed houses. The\nband actually hail from America's West Coast, which probably accounts\nfor their strange taste in clothing.\nTheir first single to be released in\nthis country is on EMI and entitled\nFight Like A Brave. It is a lively little\nnumber that has a persistent and\nsomewhat annoying bassline. The\nbass tries too hard to be like that on\na Level 42 track and fails dismally.\nThe introduction is my favourite part\nof the song and makes it seem quite\npromising to begin with but it has a tedious instrumental break half way\nthrough and never recovers.\nAs far as vocals go, they are amish mash of New York style rapping a la\nBeastie Boys and West Coast rock.\nAn interesting combination, which\nmeans that the song has no hook and\nis likely never to see the Top 40. The\nlyrics are dead clever: Fight like a brave, don't be a slave and If you 're\nsick and tired of being sick and tired.\nIt obviously took them a long time to\nthink of that one!\nI'm sure the boys look very\nfetching in their socks but the vinyl\ndoesn't grab me, man. This record\ndoesn't do very much for me, but I think that if they can sort out where\nthey're coming from they could make\nsome good music in the future.\nWatch out for them on TOTP!\nV.A.N. WANTED: more record, film,\nstage and gig reviews. Pop into the\nFELIX Office at 12.45pm today if\nyou're interested.\nUNION Manchester invaded\nby SLAGS-official!\nOn Saturday a momentous event\noccurred which was unfortunately\nignored by the press, (apart from an\ninch in the Observer and a photo of\na man dressed as Maggie Thatcher in\nthe News of the World). What was\nthis event you ask? It was the 'Stop\nClause 28' rally in Manchester, of\ncourse! 20,500 (Twenty thousand and\nfive hundred!) Gay and Lesbian\npeople marched through Manchester\nstreets, past the open-mouthed\nSharons and Barrys, ending up in\nAlbert Square, outside Manchester\nTown Hall.\nThis was the biggest demonstration\nin Manchester for TWENTY YEARS, and the biggest gathering of\nGay and Lesbians ever!! Celebrities\nsuch as Ian McKellan, Michael\nCashman (EastEnders \"Colin\")\nJimmy Sommerville, Linda Bellos\n(Lambeth Council Leader) etc, etc,\netc, all turned up to march and speak.\nI think the highlight of the day was\ngetting on the 8.20am train from\nLondon Euston, and it was PACKED\nwith Gay people. Then a family got\non, and standing amongst 20\nscreaming queens, the woman asked\nher husband \"Do you think it's so full\nbecause of the football match?\"!!!\nEveryone cracked up, but no-one had\nthe heart to tell her why it was full!!\nMany thanks to all the\nheterosexuals who turned up for the\nmarch (obviously not everyone is a neo-fascist in this country).\nLots of Love,\nJames Papa\nPS.

    "content": "BOAT Burway and the Blues\nThe Star Novice Crew\nHaving missed Henley 4s Head due\nto flooding of the Thames, Burway\nHead was the first chance this year\nfor most members of the club (except\nthe 1st eight who were rowing\nCambridge) to find out how good\ntheir winter's training had been. The\nFour's division was held first with\nfour Imperial crews racing. The\nsecond eight having split into two\ncox less fours impressed both with\ntheir rowing and their new lycra skin\ntight rowing suits winning both Elite\ncox less( fastest four overall) and\nSenior II cox less(3 rd fastest overall).\nThe Senior III cox ed four also rowed\nwell to win their class comfortably.\nThe stars were however, the novices,\nwho following 5 months rowing\nunder the coaching of J Pop O 'Brien\nwon their division by the margin of\n1 min and 32 seconds (pretty good\nover a12 min race). All in all four\nwins out of four was not too bad.\nIn the eights division, Imperial had\nentries in the Senior 1 and Novice\ncategories. Unfortunately, some\nrather inconsistent timing led to a few\nodd results, one of which meant that\nthe IC Novice eight did not win,\nhowever, the second eight rowing in\nthe Senior 1 category won their\ndivision quite comfortably.\nOnce again the Club found its\nresources over stretched and the\nladies' boat could not be transported\nto Burway. It was regrettable that the\nladies crew did not find any of the\nsubstitute boats suitable, so they did\nnot row.\nIC 1st Eight V Cambridge\nLast weekend saw the IC 1st Eight\nrace the Cambridge 'Blue' boat in a private competition at Ely, just\noutside Cambridge. The Cambridge\nEight stroked by ex-ICBC member\nGuy Pooley, is probably one of the\nbest crews to challenge Oxford for a number of years with an average\nweight of 14 stone compared to\nImperials 12Vi stones.\nThe crews were to race over two\nfifteen minute pieces on Saturday\nfollowed by three five minute pieces\non Sunday. As expected, in the first\npiece Cambridge took a Vi length lead\nin the first minute but after eleven\nminutes, had only managed to gain a1 length advantage and finished the\npiece only some 2 lengths clear. In\nthe second piece, Cambridge started\nwith a slight lead and Imperial again\nfought a hard race only losing by\nabout 5 lengths.\nSunday's five minute rows\nprovided some very good racing\nbetween the crews with attempts by\nboth cox es to gain the advantage\nround bends. Both crews pushed\ncontinuously through the pieces, IC\nat times rating 40 strokes per minute.\nThe final five minute race proved the\nmost exciting with Cambridge getting\na slight lead off the start and Imperial\nthen fighting back all through the\npiece to end only some lk a length\ndown. In all, the weekend proved\nvery successful in giving some strong\ncompetition to both crews and\nhopefully the race experience gained\nwill prove valuable in the weeks to\ncome.\nTwo halves\nImperial College\u20142\nLondon Hospitals\u20142\nThe severe weather conditions\ndominated the game. London\nHospitals won the toss and elected to\nkick against the ferocious wind. IC\ndominated the first half knowing that\nthey would have to take advantage of\nthe wind.\nIC scored the first goal mid-way\nthrough the first half from a good\nbuild up. The ball was passed from\nthe halfway line to N Collier who was\nwaiting on the edge of the box, he\nvolleyed it to the other side of the box\nto Alan Glass who laid it in the path\nof Paul Oden who scored.\nThe second goal came from a bad\nback pass from a LH's defender\nallowing Phil Ewart to score. At halftime the score stood at 2-0 and IC\nmust have wondered whether they\nhad capitalised enough in the first\nhalf.\nAlthough LH were not a very\nstrong side IC were finding it hard to\nclear the ball out of their half. Due\nto the strong wind IC could only\nmanage a few attacks and spend most\nof the time defending.\nThe referee awarded a dubious free\nkick to LH on the edge of IC's box,\nfrom which they scored. Their other\ngoal was to come from a free kick on\nthe left hand side of the pitch. The ball\nwas crossed and a LH player swung\nat it and with luck and good\njudgement it went into the top of the\ngoal.\nThe final score was 2-2 and it was\ncertainly a game of two halves.\n6 - ASIDE CRICKET Inside out!\nThe qu ali fi ying round of the UAU\nindoor cricket championship was held\non Sunday February 21 at City\nUniversity; IC found themselves\ndrawn against UCL and Sussex\nUniversity, the other group being\nKent, Essex and LSE.\nIC started impressively with a comfortable win over UCL; Rajeev\nDewan top scored with 31 out of a total of 114 from the a lot ted12 overs,\nUCL managing just 80 in reply.\nWith UCL also loosing to Sussex,\nIC had to defeat Sussex to ensure a place in the qualifying round final,\nand a possible trip to Newcastle to\nplay in the National finals. After a dreadful start IC were reeling at 4 for\n2 and an already confident Sussex side\nseemed certain to restrict IC to a very\nlow score. An aggressive partnership\nbetween Punkaj Patel and Jagot\nFernando however, enabled IC to\nreach and impressive total of 136 for\n5. Sussex found what little confidence\nthey had left soon drained away as\nthey slumped to a dismal 51 all out.\nVictory over Sussex saw IC reach\nthe qualifying final where they met\nEssex who had scraped through as\nwinners of the other group after some\nfar from convincing performances.\nAfter an excellent start to IC's innings\nby Rajeev Dewan and Michael\nAnderson, five confused run-outs\nresulted in IC stumbling to a disappointing 70 all out. Such a modest total should have posed few\nproblems for Essex, yet they lost four\nwickets and never looked\ncomfortable. Defeat resulted in IC\nfailing to reach the national final\ndespite producing the most impressive\ncricket of the tournament.\nSAILING IC at the helm\nLast Saturday saw Imperial at its\nhome reservoir, racing against the\nother main colleges of London for the\nCastaways Cup. Four teams entered,\nIC, QMC, Kings and the much\nfancied UC.\nRacing was initially organised in a round robin style with teams racing\neach other twice. The first race of the\nday set Imperial against University\nCollege. With two helms from the\nLondon first team, UC looked the\nteam to beat. The race began with no\nclear leader emerging at the first\nmark. However, at the second mark,\nindescribable sailing by Rob\nKimberly allowed Imperial to take a commanding lead. Unfortunately a mistake by the captain, caused by the\nincessant arguing of his crew, allowed\nUC back into the race, which they\neventually won.\nAfter a re-arrangement of the team,\nIC raced against QMC. From the start\nApostolos Leonidhopolous and\nRichard Jarman established an\nunbeatable lead which they hal d all\nthe way round the course to give IC\ntheir first win.\nThis set the scene for the remainder\nof the qualifying races with Imperial\nwinning almost every race easily,\noverwhelming Kings (twice) and\nQMC (again) but only narrowly\ndefeating UC.\nThus IC qualified for the final\nagainst QMC, who surprisingly had\nbeaten UC twice in the earlier rounds.\nThe final was to be the best of\nthree, but in the event QMC were\noutclassed. Imperial won the first two\nraces easily, to become the top sailing\ncollege in London.\n16 Friday 26th February 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "THE EDUCATION REFORM BILL AND ITS IMPLICATIONS\nThis document details the implications of the Education Reform Bill from the\nviewpoint of Imperial College Union. It should be noted that these points are\nare restricted to the direct effect that it will or may have on Imperial College.\nIt is felt that sufficient information is available on its implication to the education\nsystem as a whole.\nOf the 142 clauses in the Bill only 12 have direct relevance to Universities,\nalthough many set precedents that could ultimately affect Imperial College, whilst\na large number include phrases which allow the Secretary of State to change a proposal that has been passed without reference to Parliament.\nIn the 12 clauses which have relevance to Universities, Imperial College should be\nconcerned about only three but they are, in fact, very crucial clauses. At the\nsame time, we should be gravely concerned about other clauses in the Bill which\ngive the Secretary of State unreasonable powers over other educational institutions.\nThere are far too many of these to discuss in full but Clause 139 illustrates the\nmatter fairly well:\n139. - ( 1 ) . The Secretary of State may by order make such\nmodifications in any enactment relating to employment\nand, in particular, in any enactment -(a) conferring powers or imposing duties on employers;\n(b) conferring rights on employees; or\n(c) otherwise regulating the regulations between employers\nand employees;\nas he considers necessary or expedient in consequence of the operation\nof any of the provisions of this Act mentioned in subsection (2) below\n(2) Those provisions are -(a) sections 33(2) and (3) and 34(9) and Schedule 2; and\n(b) subsections (2) to (8) of section 10*.\nNeedless to say, Sections 33, 3* and 10* are the major sections concerned with the\nappointment and dismissal of staff. The Secretary of State, in proposing Clause\n139, is suggesting that he should have the power to overrule anyone else's decisions\non staffing matters. Luckily for Imperial College, the Secretary of State is bound\nby Crown legislation on universities and cannot intervene in this area as yet.\nIt is the opinion of the Union that Imperial College should at least register its\ndismay over such proposals even if they do not affect us.\nThe three clauses about which Imperial College should be particularly concerned are\nClauses 92,9* and 130. The remaining nine clauses affecting universities merely\ngive teeth to the bodies established by this Bill to enable them to carry out their\nduties.\nThe summary of Clause 92 in the Bill states:\nClause 92 and Schedule 6 provide for the establishment of the\nUniversities Funding Council, to be responsible for the administering\nfunds made available by the Secretary of State for the purpose of\nproviding education, research and other activities at universities.\nSchedule 6 makes provision for the powers, composition, staffing\nand organisation of the Council'\nWhat this actually means is the provision of a body empowered to distribute funds,\nallocated to them by the Secretary of State, to universities around Britain. This\nbody will have no power to ask for more money than it is given and is not bound\nby any regulations on what it should or should not fund.\nParaphrasing Sections * and 5 of this clause to rid it of all legalistic jargon leaves\nit reading:\n\"Council shall be responsible for administering funds made available\nfor the purpose of providing financial support for activities eligible\nfor funding. The activities are:\n(a) provision of education and research\n(b) provision of other activities by universities in\nconnection with education and research.\"\nPart (b) is the only section of this Bill which could possibly be interpreted as\nsuggesting that some body should fund student unions, let alone other welfare and\nrecreational facilities. In fact, it does not even define that they should be funded\nbut merely that they are eligible to be funded if the University Funding Council\n(UFC) feels like doing so.\nOnce paraphrased Section 7 reads:\n\"Council shall have power -(a) to keep under review activities eligible for funding\"\nThis means that any time the Council does not feel like funding these activities it\ncan stop doing so. This could mean no clubs or societies, no Haldane Library, no\nstudent representation, no Welfare office, no Accommodation office, no support for\nstudents and no student body to oppose government legislation such as this.\nThe members of the UFC are personally selected by the Secretary of State and\nthe Council is made up of 15 members, of which between 6 and 9 are to come\nfrom areas involved in industry, commerce and finance.This, in many ways, is likely\nto be a good thing for Imperial College and could possibly mean that the Council\nwill have a bias towards Imperial College when distributing funds, but that is yet\nto be seen. Unfortunately, what is demonstrated is an inclination to move towards\nprivatisation of the higher education system as a whole, a move which threatens\nnot only to preclude many people from gaining further education because of their\nbackground but also the funding of welfare services and student unions. The rest\nof the Bill shows a distinct tendency towards laying the ground for such a move.\nA move such as this would be disastrous for education in the fields of arts and\nhumanities and, at the same time, endanger research and study in areas which do\nnot give short-term financial gain, such as the Departments of Maths and Pure'\nPhysics, sections of Geology, any long-term research project and many more areas\nat Imperial.\nThe summary of Clause 9* reads:\n\"Clause 9* empowers the Secretary of State to confer additional\nfunctions on the Funding Councils, and makes supplementary provision\nfor the payments which they make and the grant which they may\nreceive from the Secretary of State.\"\nThree very important sections are contained in this clause:\nSection 2 allows the UFC to require repayment of any part of a University's funding, including any interest that would otherwise\nhave been earned on that money, if any condition specified by the UFC at the time of issuing the fund is not complied with.\n\n"

Atfirstwe were inclined to blame missing posters\non over-zealous cleaners or high winds and insufficient\nblu-tac, but this week it became clear what was really\nhappening. On the Thursday prior to Picocon some twenty\nposters were put up along the walkway between Mech Eng\nand the bookshop. By Friday morning they had gone and\nso were replaced. By lunchtime the replacements had gone,\nand so more went up. By 3pm they too had been removed.\nWhoever did it wasn't remotely subtle\u2014adjacent posters\nfrom STOIC, ICSO etc that had been up since Wednesday\nwere left untouched.\nWe don't know what motivates this person (we hope\nit isn't another group); maybe they don't like one of us,\nor they hate SFSoc as a whole.

It was a shame that there\nwas no mention of Monopoly which was the next day,\nconsequently only forty people turned up and we only\nraised \u00a31,800. We in Rag believe that we should put on\na balance of different events, collecting externally is a lot\nof hard work for the individuals actually doing it (ask\nanyone who was on Monopoly) and if we only collected\nexternally we would soon burn out the people involved.\nFor the rest of this term there are at least five external\ncollections a week (although most involve only two\npeople), a few large sponsored events and some 'fun'\nevents (like eat Fatso's bare on March 1) that are not aimed\nto raise that much money. Instead of putting people off\nRag (or its sponsored events) as an ex-VP of Rag you could\nhave devoted the space to highlighting the other things\nRag does.\nJust for the record, Rag has raised in total \u00a322,600 this\nyear (calculated at 3am last Sunday) and the next Rag raid\nis on Saturday to Chelmsford with free tickets to the\npy jama party afterwards\u2014there are still some places left,\nmore details at the Rag meeting today (Friday), 12.30pm, Union Lounge.

The\nAssociation of University Teachers\n(AUT) and the Universities have\ncondemned it. The NUS are marching\ntomorrow against it. What is it?\nKenneth Baker's 'Great Education\nReform Bill' is (or 'GERBILL' for\nshort) proposing the first major\nreform of education since 1944. Why\nis it causing so much concern?\nThe major changes to the\nuniversities are in the way that central\nfunding is given out. At the moment,\na body called the University Grants\nCommission (UGC) sits between the\nUniversities and the Government, and\ncontains a majority of representatives\nof the universities, including the IC\nCollege Secretary, John Smith. The\nUGC advises the Government\nfIt's the Year of the Dragon!\nDiscover China in '88...\nBeijing \u00a3456 m Hong Kong \u00a3456 \u2122\nand all around Asia\nThailand \u00a3345 m Malaysia \u00a3420 \u2122\nIndia \u00a3375 \u2122\nBook now before it's too late!\ntor low cost worldwide flights,\ntours, holidays and expert advice\ntor the independent traveller.\nSpecial fares\nfor students\nand academics\nAsk lor our brochures \u2014\nsee how far you can go!\nUl U travel ULU Travel\nImperial College\nSherfield Building\nPrince Consort Road\nLONDON SW7\nEnquiries and Bookings: 3C G3\nEuropean 01-581 (233\nIntercontinental 01-581 1022\nSTAi\nThe Wo rid beaters Minister on what the universities\nneed, and decides how to distribute\nfunds passed from central\nGovernment.\nThe GERBILL proposes that the\nUGC is replaced by another body, the\nUniversity Funding Council (UFC),\nwhich will contain a majority from\nindustry, commerce and finance. This\nbody will only have the power to do\nwhat the Secretary of State tells it. It\nwill not be able to make\nrepresentations on behalf of the\nUniversities to the Government, but\nis only there to distribute any cash\ngiven to it, and even this will be under\nthe directions of the Minister. The\nidea of the Bill is 'to achieve the right\nnumber and balance of graduates in\nthe 1990s'. What they really mean is\nthat they want a higher education\nsystem based only on the needs of\ncommerce and industry. Once the\nuniversities are churning out industry-orientated graduates, they can shift\nthe funding for these courses onto\nindustry itself.\nTo do this, however, they need to\nbreak up the way universities are\nfunding at the moment to separate\nfunding for separate courses. To do\nthis they have suggested, in one\ndiscussion document, the idea of\n'contract funding'.\nContract Funding\nThe idea of contract funding is that\nuniversities would have to put in\n'competitive tenders' of how much it\nwould cost for them to educate so\nmany students, and the cheapest\nwould be awarded the contract and get\nthe funding. This has already\nhappened for a few courses started\nrecently. This has many implications,\nnot least for funding of student\nservices not directly connected with\none course or department;\naccommodation, student unions,\nwelfare services and so on. All these\nare an essential part of student life,\nbut with no mention in the GERBILL\nat all. Contract funding itself is not\nmentioned in the Bill either, but one\nof the most worrying features of the\nwhole Bill is that it gives the Secretary\nof State (be they Tory, Labour or\nwhatever) the power to introduce\nmajor changes, like contract funding,\nwithout even taking it through\nParliament. The Croham Report,\nwhich recommended the formation of\nthe UFC, suggested that one of the\nfirst jobs of the new UFC shall be the\nintroduction of contract funding.\nThe Robbins Principle\nThe Robbins Principle, from a report\nin the 60s, says that Higher Education\nshould be available for all who can\nbenefit from it. The GERBILL\nproposes a system where higher\neducation is based on the needs of\nindustry, not the students, and would\nmean the effective abandonment of\nthe principle. Higher education would\nbe available to two groups, those that\nare suitable for 'industry-orientated\ncourses', and those that can afford to\npay for other types of courses. Even\nthe industry-orientated courses may\nbe funded by loans, and there are\nrumours that the Government will\nattempt to introduce them again; last\ntime it was attempted, they withdrew\nthe proposals with a pending election\nand objection from Tory parents.\nThe major courses that will be hit\nare Arts and Social Science courses,\nwithout a strong vocational content,\nand obviously this will not affect\nImperial directly. However, with\nindustry 'calling the shots' in the\nUniversities, research will become\nmore orientated towards short term\nindustrial goals, and longer term and\nmore theoretical work will have\ndifficulty attracting industrial money.\nAlso, as research becomes more\nbased around industrial contracts, the\nfree flow of information between\nindividuals and research groups will\nbecome restricted as research results\nbecome 'trade secrets'.\nTenure\nAnother part of the Bill abolishes\n'tenure', whereby academics are\ngiven job security for life. Although\ntenure does not exist at Imperial, its\nabolition will allow academics to be\nsacked, courses closed and\ndepartments shut down purely on\nfinancial grounds. More worrying is\nthat the Secretary of State will be able\nto determine a lecturer's appointment,\nand there will be little incentive to\nquestion or criticize the Government.\nMore Students\nThe Bill proposes a5% increase in\nstudent numbers, an extra 50,000 (ten\ntimes the size of Imperial) by 1990,\nand in the same period aims to cut\nfunding by \u00a3126m. The growth,\naccording to Baker, will have to come\nfrom \"better value for money\" from\nhigher education. This at a time when\nuniversities are already closing\ndepartments and sacking staff to meet\nGovernment targets. This is one of the\nmajor omissions in the Bill; it\nproposes large changes in the\nUniversity system, an increase in\nstudent numbers, and a shift to the\nmore expensive 'industry-orientated'\ncourses, without addressing the issue\nof how it is going to be paid for.\nAnother omission is that Student\nUnions are not mentioned once in the\nGERBILL. It does, however, give the\nMinister the power to determine\nexactly where money is spent within\nthe University system, and imposes\nFELIX Friday 26th February 1988 3\n\n"

    "content": "by Steve Black\nPhysics lost one of its greatest writers last week, when Richard Feynman died\nof cancer. He had a Nobel Prize but he could still explain complicated physics to ordinary people. For example: 'The neutrino is almost, but not quite, totally\nuseless; take your son-in-law as a model... '. He may have been a smart as s, but that made his books (he wrote good textbooks and good popular books),\na delight to read. He also played the bongos, as readers of his textbooks will\nknow. He made physics a more popular and more humane subject.\nBooks\nand\nScience\nScience is too important to be left to\nthe scientists. We have, for too long,\ndone our best to keep our knowledge\nto ourselves. The excuse is that 'a little knowledge is a dangerous thing'.\nWe have been content to let the public\nremain completely ignorant of our\nsubjects, assuming that our work is\nunaffected by their ignorance.\nWe can no longer afford the luxury\nof our ivory towers: we have to come\ndown to earth and tell people what we\nhave been doing with their money.\nScience needs a constant supply of\nnew scientists to keep it going, and\nin some subjects the supply is drying\nup because no one has bothered to tell\nanyone outside the profession how\ninteresting it really is.\nIgnorance breeds suspicion. For\nexample, the public's monumental\nignorance of chemistry has created the\nbelief that any food containing\n'chemicals' is poisoned in a reckless\nattempt to increase chemical industry\nprofits. We only have ourselves to\nblame when this happens. Our lack\nof interest in the day-to-day relevance\nof our science to the man in the street\ninevitably leads to such anti-science\nattitudes.\nThis week's column is a brief-review of some of the books that have\ntried to fill that yawning chasm in\npublic understanding.\nMy first choice is Molecules\n(Scientific American Library, 1987).\nThis is a book about chemistry for\npeople who don't know any\nchemistry. The author, Peter Atkins,\nis well known for his textbooks on\nPhysical Chemistry and Quantum\nMechanics. But, instead of starting his\nbook with an explanation of chemical\nbonding or reactivity (which is highly\noff putting), he concentrates simply on\nthe structure of molecules. He\ndescribes the structures with the aid\nof colourful 'portraits' built from\ntouching spheres representing the\nindividual atoms. He is careful\nenough not to assume that the\nreadership will understand the sort of\nshorthand notation usually used by\nchemists to describe molecular\nstructure, so he gives a very gentle\nintroduction to the interpretation of\nthe pictures.\nIt is truly amazing how much\nchemistry can be appreciated just\nfrom these structural portraits. Even\nexperienced chemists can gain new\ninsights into common everyday\nchemistry by glancing at the pictures.\nThe book is a guided tour through\nthe chemical makeup of the everyday\nworld. Atkins starts with the air we\nbreathe (and stops to mention some\nof its common pollutants). Then he\nshows us the structures of the things\nthat we use as fuels for our cars and\nour bodies (the structure of petrol is\nnot so far removed from the structure\nof margarine). He talks about the\nmolecules that go into plastics, and\nthe molecules that make our food taste\nthe way it does. There is a section on\nthe chemicals that make nature\ncolourful, and finally a selection of\ngood and bad chemicals (everything\nfrom aspirin to TNT).\nThis book de mystifies chemistry: it\nshows that the molecules made by\nchemists are the same as the\nmolecules used by nature. It deals in\ngeneralities and leaves many\nquestions for inquiring minds. The\nstyle alone (never mind the quality of\nthe diagrams), literate, humourous\nand exciting. It is probably the first\never book to make the mysteries of\nchemistry as accessible as the over-hyped mysteries of cosmology and\nparticle physics.\nIn short, it is one of the best\nintroductory science books I have\never read (and the first one ever\nwritten by a chemist). Chemistry\nwould be in less trouble than it is now\nin if there were more books like it.\nAnother classic of unpretentious\nexplanation is: The New Science of\nStrong Materials: or Why You Don't Fall Through the Floor, by JE Gordon (Penguin, 1977). The title\ngives away the style of the book: it\nis the sort of book that asks and\nanswers obvious everyday questions\nwithout bothering to obfuscate the\nanswers with technical gobbledygook.\nIts answers are, however, sound\nenough for it to be an Open\nUniversity set book.\nThe book is about the mysterious\ninterface b tween chemistry, physics\nand engineering called material\nscience. The important questions are\nwhy are some things weak and others\nstrong? Why is everything weaker\nthan it ought to be?\nThe book neatly explains the\ndifference between stiffness and\ntoughness (something that we had a lot of trouble with at school). It also\ngoes into the details of what\nmicroscopic properties make\ncompounds behave as they do. Steel\nis tough and strong, concrete is\nsometimes strong, but is brittle and\nsometimes weak. Wood is tough, but\nrelatively soft. If you want to know\nwhy, but you don't want to be buried\nby technical jargon, then this is the\nbook for you.\nMy final recommendation is\nRichard Dawkin's recent book The\nBlind Watchmaker (Longman, 1987).\nDawkins already had a reputation for\ncontroversy and clarity of exposition\nbecause of his earlier book, The\nSelfish Gene. This book again\ndemonstrates his ability to describe\nobscure facets of the process of\nevolution in a way that anyone (except\na diehard creationist) can appreciate.\nFor example, he uses pictorial\ncomputer models to demonstrate that\nunexpected new forms can arise\nthrough the process of natural\nselection. His illustrations go a long\nway towards breaking down the\nintuitive barrier that prevents most\npeople from appreciating how\nevolution works.\nHe is a skilled and careful writer,\ncapable not only of producing\ngrammatical English sentences (rare\nenough in the world of science) but\nof producing the sort of clear\nexplanation that is a joy to read.\nThese are three of my favourite\nwriters. There are only a few more\nin their league. We need more, or\nscience might not have much of a future.\n8 Friday 26th February 1988 FELIX\n\n"

New production\nmethods meant greater capacity to\nproduce, and the introduction of self\nservice required highly packaged\nproducts.\nBy the 1960's the marketing\nindustry had discovered how to\nstimulate consumption. In order to\nsell more and more, the industrialised\nworld was trained to discard and\nreplace everything, and frequently.\nAttitudes to waste changed, and\nconsumerism became a way of life.\nThis encouragement to produce\nrubbish is quietly assisted by the\neffective waste collection service. By\nremoving rubbish as fast as it is\ngenerated, it is hidden from the public\nview. If it all stayed on the doorsteps,\npeople would think twice about\nthrowing things away.\nOnce the rubbish is collected, it\nusually ends up on a rubbish tip. The\neuphemism 'landfill site' is often used\nto pretend that these rubbish dumps\nserve some useful purpose. However,\nthey contain a lethal mixture of\nsolvents, pesticides, cleaning fluids,\nand oil, along with rotting organic\nwaste, and huge volumes of\npackaging and plastic. This poisonous\nmixture soon begins to react.\nInflammable gases are released, and\nchemicals such as mercury, nickel\nand various solvents are washed\nthrough the soil to appear in our\ndrinking water.\nBurning the waste produces even\nmore pollution. Plastics and wood\npreservatives give off dioxins as they\nare burnt, which are among the most\npoisonous substances known. The\nsmoke contains a lethal mixture of\nfumes and adds to the problems of\nacid rain. While burning rubbish for\nenergy sounds like a good idea, our\nrubbish tips contain such a range of\nmaterials that a host of expensive\nfilters and scrubbers are needed to\nclean up the smoke produced.\nThe problems of what to do with\nall this rubbish would be greatly eased\nif it was sorted as it is discarded. A number of constituents of the\ndomestic waste bin can easily be\nrecycled, as long as they are collected\nseparately.\nThirty percent of domestic waste is\norganic material which makes\nexcellent compost. In the country,\norganic waste should never be\ncollected\u2014it can simply be returned\nto the garden. In the city, this is a little\nharder, but if collected separately,\norganic waste can still be used for\ncompost. Several towns in Germany\nalready do this, using separate\ndustbins for organic waste.\nGlass can also be recycled. Broken\nglass from bottle banks is added to\nnew molten glass in a furnace. The\nresult is a huge saving in the amount\nof energy needed to produce glass.\nBetter still, returnable bottles require\neven less energy to re-use.\nThen of course there's plastic. The\ngreat virtue of plastic is its durability.\nHowever, this makes it totally\ninappropriate for most of the uses to\nwhich it is put. For instance, a carrier\nbag, which will last for centuries, is\nonly used for perhaps a few days.\nWorse still, foam polystyrene is used\nfor fast food containers which are\noften only used for a few minutes\u2014\nto keep the food warm long enough\nto leave the restaurant!\nDisposing of plastic is a tricky\nbusiness. Both burning and burying\nrelease poisonous fumes such as vinyl\nchloride gas. The only answer seems\nto be not to use so much plastic in the\nfirst place. However, there are certain\nplastics which can be melted down\nand recast into heavy duty items such\nas floor tiles and fence posts.\nIt is also possible to produce\nbiodegradable plastics from natural\nsubstances such as sugar and\ncarbohydrates, rather than oil. Such\nplastics will decompose within a year\non a compost heap. Clearly, careful\nthought can ensure the problem of\ndisposing of plastic is solved, by using\nit appropriately.\nThere are many solutions to the\nproblems of waste, by careful\nselection of materials for packaging,\nand by sorting rubbish as it is\ndiscarded. The latest enemy of\nenvironmentally sound waste disposal\nare the composite materials which\nmanufacturers seem to love. These\nare impossible to recycle as they\ncannot be separated.\nConsumer pressure has already\nbeen seen to work in removing\nadditives from food. The next target\nshould be the packaging it comes in.\nWe must demand simpler and\nrecyclable packaging.\nTropical Rainforests\nTropical forests, commonly known as\nRainforests, are disappearing at an\nalarming rate. While it is hard to\nmonitor exactly how fast they are\nbeing cleared, it is estimated by the\nU.S. Department of Energy that 20\nmillion hectares are lost every year.\nThat's an area the size of England,\nScotland and Wales.\nThese forests have evolved over\nmillions of years, and at present cover\n6% of the Earth's surface. They are\nalso the richest biological systems.\nMore than half of all wild species on\nearth live in these Rainforests.\nThe reasons for the deforestation\nmainly lie with the spread of non-sustainable farming in the developing\nworld, and with extensive and\nTHE STATISTICS\n\u2022 40% of all tropical forests have disappeared since 1945\n\u2022 Every year 20 million hectares of tropical forest are destroyed\nor irreversibly damaged. That's100 acres every minute.\n\u2022 5 million hectares per year are consumed by commercial logging.\nThe logging damages the forests so badly that thay cannot be\nrenewed, and the trees will not grow properly. Tropical loggers\nmake no attempt to replant felled areas.\n\u2022 In an area of 4 square miles of Rainforest there are up to 1,500\nspecies of flowering plant, 750 species of tree, 400 species of\nbutterfly, 125 of mammals, 100 of reptiles, and 50 of amphibians.\n\u2022 Over 50 different wild species become extinct every day\nmore than one every half hour!\n\u2022 40 years ago, Ethiopia had forests covering 40% of its land,\nand a population of 4.5 million. Today trees less than 5%, and the\npopulation has risen to 40 million.\n\u2022 Globally, over 1 billion people depend on water from tropical\nRainforests to irrigate their crops.\n\u2022 As a result of deforestation in the Himalayas, India spends over\n$1 million annually on river defences to control seasonal flooding.\ndestructive logging. The countries in\nwhich the rainforests are situated,\nsuch as Brazil, Zaire and Indonesia,\nhave rapidly growing populations,\nand they desperately need wood for\nfuel, and land on which to grow\ncrops.\nWhere once small groups of\nindigenous peoples used traditional\nshifting cultivation methods, there are\nnow huge numbers of landless\nmigrants, moving into the areas. They\nuse 'slash and burn' farming, clearing\nvast areas of forest to plant crops,\nbecause they do not know how to use\nthe forests sustain ably for food. In\nBrazil, the government has embarked\non a forced programme of migration\ninto the Rainforests.\nThe second biggest cause of\ndeforestation is commercial logging.\nThe forests are either clear-felled or\nselectively logged. Clear-felling is\nused to produce pulp for the paper\nindustry, and involves the removal of\neverything, leaving the land bare.\nSelective logging is used where only\ncertain species are wanted, typically\nfor the timber trade. Whilst only 10\n- 15% is removed, selective logging\nstill leaves the forest severely\ndamaged, and usually, 30 - 60% of\nthe trees are destroyed.\nThe logging is encouraged by the\neconomic situation. Many tropical\ncountries have growing debts, and are\nforced to use their natural resources\nto meet the interest repayments. The\ndemand for consumer goods and\npackaging in the developed world\nexasperates the situation.\nThe rapid clearing of Rainforests\nprovides short-term relief for the\ncountries containing them. However,\nthe long term effects can be\ndisastrous. As most of the nutrients\nare contained in the dense vegetation,\nclearing the Rainforests leaves the soil\nbarren. Crops can only be grown for\na few years before the land is\nexhausted. This is in direct contrast\nto the experience in non-tropical\nregions, where land cleared of forest\nleaves fertile soil.\nWater supplies are seriously\nthreatened by deforestation. The\ntropical Rainforests receive half the\nworld's rainfall, and soak up the\nwater, slowly releasing it to the\nsurrounding areas during the dry\nseasons. Clearing the forests removes\nthis storehouse, and causes alternate\nflooding and drought.\nSoil erosion is another\nconsequence. The intense rainstorms\ncan remove 70 tonnes of soil per acre\nin just half an hour. Where once the\nsoil was protected from this onslaught\nby the vegetation, if it is left bare, it\nis simply washed away. Rivers silt up\ndown-stream and cause more flooding\nin the coastal regions.\nPerhaps the most serious result is\nthe effect on the global weather. The\nloss of Rainforests results in a general\ndecrease of rainfall in the countries\ninvolved. Worse still, the build-up of\ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere\nleads to the 'greenhouse effect',\nwhich it is estimated will raise\ntemperatures by two to three degrees\nover the next fifty years. This is\nsufficient to melt the polar caps,\nflooding the coastal regions where a third of the world's population live,\nand making the equatorial regions\nuninhabitable.\nNo-one is really sure of the long-term effects of the loss of the\nRainforests are. At the current rate\nthere will be very little left by the next\ncentury. The predicted consequences\nrange from the mildly disastrous to\nthe total loss of all life on Earth.\nFELIX Friday 26th February 1988 7\n\n"
