    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 1 6 TH MAY Hustings \"grilling\"\ncontinued from front page\nMary's. The hu sting as described by\nClare was \"more intensive. I certainly got a grilling\". This time round she\nwas asked about her views on a broader range of subjects, although\nthe focus was still on the merger.\nMore questions were based around\nher and her experience within the\nunion, in which she admitted that she\nhas never turned up to a ICU council\nmeeting and her only involvement\nhas been in the Entertainments committee and being a DJ.\nHer mains goals as president next\nyear would be to \"promote harmony\nbetween the two unions by promoting inter contact in sports societies,\nand also to fight about the issue of\ntop up fees\". A main point that\nrepeatedly turned up was how she\nsaw the role of the additional sabbatical position intended to be created at\nthe end of the next college year, her\nviews was that the post should be a \"Mary's\" s abb and that it's main\nrole, in it's first year at least, was to\naid the medics in their transition to\nthe South Kensington site, she also\nstated that the post should go to a medic as they \"understand the pressure that a medical student is under\nbetter than an IC student.\"\nWhen asked what she would have\ndone had she been president this\nyear, she brought up two main\npoints. Firstly was the loss of the\nbookstore, she saw it \"was a great\nshame because it meant that,\nalthough college has increased the\nunion's funding by \u00a320,000 to\nreplace the income lost, it makes the\nunion more dependent on the colleges finances as opposed to being\nindependent body, but it has also created a greater profile for the union as\na whole as students have became\nmore aware of their services and out-lets\".\nSecondly was that she would not\nhave accepted the move of the exams\nto the marquee, and believes that the\nunion should have lead some kind of\na revolt with the students against the\nidea. She also commented that the\npresident should be more accessible,\nand that she would make herself\nmore visible around the union making it easier for students to approach\nher.\nWhen asked why she did not drink\nthe 8 pints that were bought for her as\na challenge, she said \"I just had to\nkeep my head up there, but I plan to\nfinish the pints and carry on drinking\ntill late into the night.\"\nLives saved from fire\nKELLY ROBINSON AND MAHLINA PONNIAH\nThousands of lives were heroically\nsaved on Tuesday when the air-con-d it ion ing system in a Biochemistry\nlab spontaneously com busted. Several brave men in heavy breathing apparatus battled through the\nsmoke to rescue the defenceless vic-tim s. Shortly before 9am, in a room on\nthe sixth floor of the Biochemistry\nbuilding, the electric motor of an air-conditioning unit burnt out, allowing\nthe unit to overheat, and resulting in\nan isolated fire. Graham Cox, IC's own Fire Officer, arrived on the\nscene, and on ascertaining that the\nsmoke was not too thick, proceeded\nto enter the room, together with Mick\nRogers, the Technical Services\nManager for Biochemistry, and two\nfire engineers, who were also present\nat the time (although quite how all\nthose people managed to squeezed\ninto the room at the same time\nremains a mystery!)\nThe room was home to several\nthousand fruit-flies and Mr Cox's immediate priority was to remove\nthese occupants to safety; after first\ndonning the appropriate safety gear.\nOnce the flies were out of harm's way Mr Cox used a nearby carbon\ndioxide extinguisher to smother the\n\"flames\" and Mr Rogers switched\noff the power to the air-conditioning\nunit. Due to the small nature of the\nfire, the smoke alarms failed to activate and the fire alarms had to be\nsounded manually. According to Mr\nCox the building \"was evacuated\nquickly and quietly; with little disruption to the running of the depart-ment.\"\nOn further investigation it was discovered that the switch controlling\nthe motor was jammed in the 'on'\nposition, a fault which should have\nbeen detected earlier, and this is what\ncaused the system failure.\nThe room should be fully functional within a few days as Mr\nRogers is already in posse sion of\nreplacement parts for the damaged\nunit. However, Mr Cox said that the\nroom will \"require a fresh coat of\npaint\" and one or two of the ceiling\ntiles will need to be replaced. The\nsole remaining problem is that of the\ndistinct smoke-like odour of the fruit\nflies.\nPresidential Interview\nInterview by Andrew, edited by ]lten\nAndrew Dorman Smith: So, New\nElection tell us about yourself.\nNew Election:\nBasically, New Election is your\nopportunity to vote to re-open no mi nations. This time of year is particularly bad for having elections many\npeople still have exams and haven't had the time to see what's going on\nin College. The view is that there\nare probably much stronger candidates out there who haven't yet had\nthe chance or the time to stand this\ntime, so if you don't like the way\nthe election is looking, if you don't like the candidate, vote New\nElection and maybe we'll get third\ntime lucky.\nADS: Thank you. We now turn to\nClare Bunston. Clare, do you\nbelieve it's the Union's job to get\nmore students interested in the\nUnion?\nCB: Yes, but it's really hard to get\npeople involved who have no intention of getting involved.\nADS: Exactly that's the whole\ndilemma, how are you going to get\nthose students involved?\nCB: I don't know. I would just do\nmy best, hopefully I would be seen\nas a President who is a normal\nhuman being who represents something that anyone can be a part of,\nas opposed to a little group of people who just go about their own\ndoings, it's not a very accessible\ngroup to become a part of unless\nyour already a part of it.\nADS: Right. In the South Ken'\nhustings, you said that opposing top-up fees was one of your main priori-ties. How will you achieve this?\nCB: I'm not in a position to fully\nunderstand what the whole issue is\nbut I will do everything I can to\nensure that top-up fees don't hap-pen, because then I believe that people will becoming to College on the\nbasis of how much money they have\nopposed to what sort of people they\nare and how qualified they are.\nADS: OK, you said that this was\none of your main priorities, so how\nwill you actually do it?\nClare Bunston and New\nElection face the grand\ninquisitor, Andrew\nDorman-Smith, to persuade us why we should\nvote for them.\nCB: Until I'm in that position, I don't really know enough about it,\nI'm afraid.\nADS: So you can't tell us how you\nare going to achieve one of your\nmain priorities?\nCB: Well, I would argue as best I could. I think that it is the general\nconsensus of opinion is that top-up\nfees wouldn't be good for the future.\nADS: On the NUS, do you think\nthere should be a referendum as to\nwhether Imperial College views are\nexpressed through the NUS?\nCB: Yeah.\nADS: So you will carry out a referendum in your next year as pre si dent?\nCB: Only if that was felt to be the\nconsensus of opinion. It doesn't really matter what I believe as a per-son, it's just I have to consult other\npeople and get the general feeling\nADS: But you'll be the President of\nImperial college...\nCB: NO, 'cos even though your the\npresident, you mustn't just...I can't just make decisions just because I am the president, its important that I have got the information to make\nthese decisions from my colleagues.\nADS: OK, You've talked a lot\nabout St Mary's both at their own\nhustings and at here. I'm a City &\nGuilds student, what can you offer\nme to get your vote?\nCB: I'm not trying to offer certain\npeople certain things to get their\nvote, I don't work like that.\nADS: But it seems that you work\nlike that with St Mary's. CB: No, not at all, that's just\nbecause I 've had a lot of feedback\nfrom the St Mary's people.\nADS: Well you've promised St\nMary's their funds will be kept, they\nwill keep their bar, can you promise\nCity & Guilds a bar?\nCB: No, because you've never\nwanted one before. Why should you\nget so upset about it?\nADS: I'm merely illustrating the\npoint that you seem to be promising\nrather a lot to St Mary's and very\nlittle to South Kensington.\nVoting in all departments on Monday 19th and Tuesday 20th May.

    "content": "HIGHSCHOOL HIGH Naked Gun and Airplane! creator\nDavid Zucker takes on Dangerous\nMinds in his latest spoof, High\nSchool High. It tells the unlikely tale\nof idealistic Richard Clark (Jon Lovitz)\nwho leaves an exclusive private\nacademy to join the front line at adela pi dated inner-city high school.\nHe is convinced that these kids\nshould be allowed to have the same\nexperiences that his private-school\npupils did - dating, going to proms\nand begging for sex.\nIn most David Zucker spoofs the\nstory would be immaterial, merely a means of filling the foreground\nwhilst the majority of jokes take\nplace in the background. However,\nHigh School High is a far cry from his other films, both in\nterms of style and quality. For a start, there's no Leslie\nNielsen. Many would no doubt be more than slightly\nrelieved at this. Unfortunately, though, the replacement is\nthe relatively unknown Jon Lovitz and his quips and facial\nexpressions just don't compare with those of the\nDonahue-lookalike. Ifs not that he's unfunny, as years of\nappearing on Saturday Night Live testify, ifs just that only\nNielsen could bring off some of the immensely daft one-liners in the script.\nThe fact that this film has anything resembling a plot\ngives away High School High's main weakness. Whereas\nNaked Gun et al were parodies of a whole genre, and\ntherefore had plenty of material to work with, Zucker's latest focuses entirely on just one not-particularly good film,\nDangerous Minds. This means its unavoidably a one-gag\nfilm, which it uses up in the first few minutes. To avoid\nmaking the repetition obvious, a storyline is introduced to\npad out the joke. Even then the plot is an exact replica of\nMichelle Pfeifer's film, with the disillusioned youngsters\nfinally coming around to Lovitz and deciding \"they wanna\nlearn\". In fact, the teenagers are the best actors in the\nfilm, especially Mekhi Phifer. (This is apparently her real\nname, and not yet another hilarious comic moment\nbased on Michelle Pfeifer). The film is short at one and a half hours, hinting that even the director knew there\nwasn't much funny material.\nChris\nAnother opportunity to see the latest film for absolutely\nnothing this week. We have yet more free tickets to give\naway courtesy of the Odeon Kensington. The latest\nrelease is The Relic, a good old-fashioned horror movie\nabout a less-than-mythical creature living in the basement\nof New York's Natutal History Museum. Once again the\nindescribably nice guys at our local cinema are donating\nFIVE pairs of tickets to those who know the answer to the\nfollowing question:\n'The monster in The Relic comes from the same\ncoffee-making South American country as the snake\nin Anaconda. Which country is this?\"\n| Anaconda's Jennifer to pez. Surely too pretty for snake fodder? |\nLast week we asked for the name of the star of Mission\nImpossible. This ridiculously easy question meant there\nwere hat-fulls of entries with the correct answer, Tom\nCruise. The winners receiving a pair of tickets for\nAnaconda are:\nThe Birdcage\nCompetition\nThis page is rapidly becoming the competition page it\nseems! As from next week,\nthere are no more film\nreviews, just countless\nchances to win freebies.\nAnyway, a couple of weeks\nago we gave you the\nopportunity to win The\nBirdcage on video, courtesy\nof those kind folk at\nMGM/UA. The question\nwas \"Which secret agent\nfeatured in Mrs Doubtfire\nwith Robin Williams?\".

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 16TH MAY LETTERS & EDITORIAL 15\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nFelix out of turn\nDear Alex,\nI would like to comment on your\nwhimsical cartoon regarding Ian\nCaldwell in issue 1083 at the end of\nlast term. I 've been associated with\nthe College for 16 years as an under-graduate/ postgraduate/ tutor/ war-den/ union official/ employee, and as\nsuch have had numerous contacts\nwith Felix both on and off the record.\nI therefore feel well qualified to\nmake the following comment.\nFelix should be a voice of our students who, at times, are right to question the way their College is run.\nFelix should be enjoyable and therefore satire is not out of place. The\nblatant attack on an Administrative\nDirector is certainly 'fair game'.\nHowever, to stoop to the depths of\npersonally insulting someone who,\naccording to previous issues, may\nnot be perfect but is certainly hon-our able, open and dedicated to\nimproving the student environment,\nis unlikely to endear you to your\nreaders.\nI enjoy reading a Felix which is\ncontroversial and outspoken; I am\nless impressed with one that ducks\nthe real problems and purely focuses\non taking the piss out of a very\ndecent blok e who is not only hardworking and extremely talented but\nwho, most importantly, is loyal to the\nCollege.\nRegards\nKen Young\nIn this case I would agree with you\nthat Ian Caldwell loo roll is probably going too far... though I think\nthe 'honourable, open and de dic at ed' picture given in previous issues\nprovides balance to this particular\nexample.\npoll: taxing\nDear Sir,\nI may be not be a Student of\nImperial College, but I felt that I simply had to write to congratulate\nDavid Roberts on the worst election\npoll in history. Well done, David.\nKeep up the good work.\nYourfaithfully,\nChris Coote, Warwick University\nFrom what I 've seen of your own\neffort, Warwick Boar, I wouldn't shout too loudly, but I'm glad to\nsee that Felix gets so far.\nhustings moan\nDear Felix,\nAfter just coming out of the ICU\nPresidential Hustings held in dBs, I cannot believe the lack of basic\nknowledge displayed by the can di date.\nWhen asked a question on whether\nor not ICU should d is affiliate from\nthe NUS, the first response was yes,\nuntil the candidate realised that ICU\nis not a part of the NUS. Given the\nlarge majority of students who voted\nagainst re-joining the NUS 2 years\nago, such a large oversight by a presidential candidate, clearly shows that\nthey are not in touch with the overall\nfeeling at Imperial, or reality!\nAlso, is someone who, at the ICU\nHustings, said \"Blokes are cunts\", an\nappropriate candidate for ICU\nPresident, given that approximately\n70% of ICU is composed of\n\"blok es\"? by the way, I would\nexpect that someone on a Biology\nand Management course would\nunderstand that this is physically\nimpossible!\nB Tucker\nComputing 11\nI 've been here for four years, and I can assure you that there are a lot\nof \"cunts\" about Brian. However,\nwhatever Ms Bunston's academic\na bil ty, I am sure she is able by now\nto place them, if isolated first.\nFrom what I can recall of the\nNUS referendum, the turnout was\npoor, at about 1500. That would\nleave approximately 6000 students\nwho didn't register their opinion\nor didn't know about it. So, perhaps Ms Bunston is, by her self-confessed ignorance, a better representative than given credit for.\nLetters may edited for content or length. The deadline for letters for\nthe next issue is Tuesday 20th May.

The fer-de-lis\nemblem on the front of the lectern is\nroyal purple on white.\n\"...However, the headline was\n\"Medics secure independence\"\nwhich, in a couple of areas we have\ndone, but this story was seen as 'a stirring story of triumph in the face\nof adversity.' I believe that this\nimminent change, in one way or\nanother, scares or worries every one\nof us...\" We pan down to look at the transcript in one of the audience's lap:\n\"However, to go on accusing us\nof being 'selfish' is simply short-sighted. Of course we are being self-ish. We are being uprooted against\nour wills and, whilst we realise that\nwithout the move, we would have a very short life-expectancy indeed,\nwe are merely trying to ensure that\ndespite the geographical changes,\nlittle else about what is a fantastic\nplace (though it does, of course,\nhave its weaknesses) alters perce pti bly.\"\nThe speaker drones on.\n\"...To criticise us directly for taking away from the members of ICU\nis a pointless twisting of fact. We are\nnot 'a room full of baying medical\nstudents' anymore than ICU students are a University of simpering\napathetic s. We are simply concerned\nto do everything within our power to\nmake ICSM a worthy successor.\"\nThe crowd are beginning to tire,\nsense that the orator was on the\nhome straight. He continued:\n\"...A couple of weeks after this, a letter was written that attempted to\nput forward our point of view.\nUnfortunately, this letter slipped\ndown the unproductive slope of\nbeing aggressive and confrontation-al. For several years now, 'St\nMary's xenophobia', a trait particular to all London Medical Schools,\nhas extended to IC. I have already\nskimmed the surface of why this has\noccurred, but I don't believe that\nthis is something that we should be\nrapidly trying to unravel. It is, for\nthe most part purely posturing and\nserves our fierce pride, but it is our\nfierce pride that drives us to our fantastic achievements.\"\nThe marquee starts to whistle and\ncheer.\n\"This is just one debate of many\nto come and it is important to realise\nthat aggressive triumphal is m is not\nwanted at IC any more than snide\njealousy and resentment are\nreceived over here. This whole\nprocess is inevitable and, as far as\nwe are concerned, we will continue\nto obtain everything that we reasonably can.\"\nThe speaker sits down to thunderous applause.

    "content": "A I SALAD\nIce Cream\nHang on a minute. The opening chords of the\nfirst song, UV, sound like Blur. No, maybe\nSleeper? Relax, it isn't THAT bad (whilst comparisons with Blur are definitely complimentary, to\nbe compared to Sleeper is nasty I know, sorry).\nThis is Salad returning with their follow-up to\ntheir debut album of a few years back, Drink\nMe.\nFormed in 1992, they have yet to really 'break'\nthe industry. Their fan base remains small yet\nsure and there is always that hope that they will\nbecome the next big thing. However, they are\nalso always keen to stress that, although\nbecoming big would be welcome, they would\nnever pander to any commercial stereotypes in\norder to get there. Noble comments indeed. So\nwhat explains the blatant pop ditty that is their\nlatest single, Cardboy King? Did someone suggest that sometimes you just have to give in\nand get a decent hit to please record company\nmanagement? I don't know, but at least they\nhaven't carried this on throughout the whole\nalbum. Although sometimes it sounds like it\nwould have been an idea to do so.\nMost of the other songs remain staunchly\nSalad-y. On these, Marijne's voice lilts from\nthe sweet and gentle [Broken Bira) to shrill\nand angry [Namedrops). The problem is\nthat there's nothing particularly outstanding\nhere. On their last album, there was Drink\nthe Elixir, Man with a Box and Motorbike To\nUM S Heaven which nestled among many other brilliant songs. That was a good album. On Ice\nCream, there's nothing to\ncompare even for a A second. Most of it\nmoves along with an\nalmost lethargic tone,\nin the musical sense,\nand the whole album\nsounds like songs that fl were rejected from\ntheir debut. Don't get me1 wrong, I do like Salad. It's just that this is very di sap pointing, t hafs all - considering how long ifs\ntaken to come\nout. (4)\nAlok\nGUTTER EROTICA\nPenthouse\nIf you're going to name your band after a soft-porn mag, you're not likely to be purveyors of\ncandy sweet teeny-bop guitar pop. This is the\nblues, but a modem, grunge tinged blues\nwith attitude. As a reviewer in a national\nmusic paper said. This could rip the arse off\nyou.\"\nListening to the album you get the impression that the band are |ust having a laugh.\nJamming away and drinking with intent.\nThey're just having fun! The music doesn't make much sense until you're rat-arse d. Only\nthen can you appreciate and relate to the\nswaggering, drunken boisterousness of the\nlead guitar, the biu es y harmonica and\nHammond, the incoherent yells of the singer,\nthe baseness of the drums and the sheer filthiness of the gut turning base line.\nComparisons could be made with the John\nSpencer blues explosion and Gallon!???)\ndrunk with a pinch of Offspring thrown in for\ngood measure. The Beauty in the Beast is a complete piss-take with some \"dod gy\" lyrics\nand groaning PI) sounds.

Well, its concept\nis that of art as an experience of situation rather than of\nobject. Installation art places the viewer inside the c re ation, en wraps him and makes him physically experience\nthe work through a combination of elements of sight,\nsound, scent and touch. It seeks to awaken the senses.\nThe viewer is not an external part of the work anymore\nand participation is rendered unavoidable. In some cases\neven, the viewer becomes an indispensable element of\nthe it; as soon as he penetrates it, he becomes part of it\nand sort of makes it come to life. The work immediately\nassigns a role to him.\nOne enters the Royal College of Art to the sound of the\nNiagara Falls. One is then led throughout the gallery by\nthe yarn of 1380 unwound bobbins.\nSome installations are disconcerting. One of them, I must confess, Ceal Floyer's Working Title, has led to the\ngrowth of a lawn of question marks in my head: I was\ndrawn to the centre of an empty space, empty but for a CD-player and two loudspeakers laid on the floor, from\nwhich was emanating the repetitive sound of the digging\nof sand.\nI left the room very perplexed, but my attention was\nimmediately captured by the following exhibit. This one\nwas going to require my complete participation. I was\nfacing a corridor. The parquet had been taken away, the\nfloor dug a little and filled with water. The parquet had\nthen been a bit reduced in size and put back again, so\nthat the floor became a 'floating floor', unstable and wet.\nThe notice under the title read: \"Please take care when\nviewing this work\". So I cautiously apprehended f he crossing with my high heels, surprised and amused.\nThe introduction of an element of physical risk renders\nthe work exciting in a way we are not used to when viewing art. It also leaves a place, more than ever, to the\noption of physical escape from the work for who refuses\nto animate it.\nSoon after this unexpected change of environment, I was led into another one, though in a different way.\nSuddenly, upon pushing the doors of Mike Bode's Corridor, in the middle of the gallery, I was transported,\nrelocated, in a hospital setting. As naturally as I had\nentered, I came out of it to find myself again in the familiar\nenvironment of the gallery.\nI was then drawn to long, thick, heavy, blue velvet curtains which were obviously hiding something. They were\nan irresistible invitation to curiosity. As if I was going to\nflout the rules, I discreetly peaked in to discover a large\ndark room, with a single spotlight - an offer for the viewer\nto enter the scene and participate in some way, supported by a gentle feminine voice, suggesting Tap your\nshoes\"...\nTake a break from revision and visit this exhibition full of\nnovelties and other surprises and do not miss the excellent slide show on the object of this event - just be careful\non which chair you sit...!\nDanuta\nThe Stones of Kolin\ny pu f[ nil Th pi if I Pfc ll U III Vl ltl W The stones of ATo//h( pronounced Colleen\nThe New End\nTheatre's next pro-duct ion, The\nCracked Comic by\nStewart Permutt,\nruns until June 1st.

She soon\ndiscovers she has her own role to play in Jewish history.\nThe music varies wildly but successfully in style from\nDvorak to modern music written specifically for the play\nthe story is in parts tragic and in parts comic but thoroughly captivating throughout.

The election has\nbeen scheduled for next Thursday\n22nd and Friday and 23rd May, and\nhustings will take on Wednesday the\n21st May.\nSince the nomination paper will\nnot come down until this Friday, only\nthree candidates so far have put their\nnames forward to stand for positions\nin the executive committee of the\nunion.

He would like to\nensure that equal attention would be\npaid to the educational needs of the\ncurrent students on the old curriculum by the new medical school,\nwhich concentrated most of its effort\non the new course recently. On the\nissue of merger, he said that he would\nThe Conference was widely perceived to have been hijacked by the\ntwo primary political factions within\nthe movement - the controlling \"New\nLabour\" group and the rival\nCampaign for Free Education - who,\naccording to UL U President Sarah\nWhite intimidated the remaining del-e gates, successfully stopping them\nspeaking. For example, in line with\nLabour policy, the NUS has recently\ngiven up it's bitter struggle to retain\ngrants, in favour of a loan-based s ys tem. Such political affiliation is nothing new - in the recent General\nElection five former NUS Presidents\nbecame MP's. However, the level of\nbar racking and in-fighting were considered far worse than anything seen\nin recent years, with the Glasgow SU\ndescribing the NUS as representing\n\"not students but political parties\"\nThis view was compounded when,\nwithout any consultation of de le gates, the National Executive\nCommittee (described as \"a bunch of\nmiddle-class tw at s\" by Scottish rep-resent at ives) cut the final day of the\nConference, so that delegates had a chance to \"assist campaigning in the\nGeneral Election\" in their\nUniversities. Mary Page, President of\nSheffield Hallam, was \"deeply\ndepressed\" by the Conference, and as\na result organised their forthcoming\nreferendum. Eric Allsop, ICU\nPresident, has offered her his full\nsupport and knowledge of how students unions can survive outside the\nNUS.\ndo his best to overcome the antagonistic feeling between the medics and\nthe rest of the College, though he\nmaintained that he would be against\nany deliberate move to force the\nmedics to integrate against their\nwish. He would also try to keep up\nthe excellent reputation of St Mary's in its music, drama and sporting\nachievement when the new intakes\narrive. Closer to home, his concern\nwould be to the keep the med school\nbars at the separate hospital sites\nopen.\nMr Jenkins, candidate for the post\nof VPE, is currently the first year rep\nin the Student Union, and has only\nbeen at Mary's for one year. In refuting the accusation that his sole intention for taking up the job was to use\nit as a stepping stone to further his\nown political career, he explained his\nThe Scottish Universities, how ev er, have more specific complaint\nwith the National Union. As well as\ndissatisfaction with the Blackpool\nConference, they site alleged forgery\nand corruption within the Scottish\nNUS. At the meeting of the Scottish\nExecutive to decide what was to be\ndiscussed in Blackpool, Keith\nRobson, President of the NUS in\nScotland, produced a letter which\npro xie d him the vote of Ros Smith,\nfrom Langside College, Glasgow.\nHowever, Ms Smith says that the letter had a forged signature, spelt her\nname wrong, and was not on College\nnotepaper. Rob Shorthouse of\nStirling University claims that he has\ncopies of forged documents, not only\nfrom Langside, but from many other\nScottish universities.\nStudents of Aberdeen University\nimmediately began attempts to d is affiliate, and rapidly gained five-hun-dred signatures on a petition calling\nfor a ballot. However, the petition\nhad to be withdrawn, as leaving NUS\nwould mean loosing the services of\nNUS Services Ltd, who, in return for\n\u00a330 000 a year, provide the cut price\ndrinks on which their Union relies.\nThe loss of NUSSL would, according to their President, \"send the\nUnion to the wall\". However, now\nthat rival company Northern Services\nare up-and-running, charging only\n\u00a325 each year, the possibility for\nAberdeen and other like-minded\nUniversities to join ICU in the pri-v ate sector is now greater than ever.\nbelief in being involved with the running of the union early on; he saw his\njunior position in the medical school\nas an advantage, because by the time\nthe merger would take place, he\nwould still be in his first clinical year,\nand thus would have both the time\nand experience to continue to help\nrunning the union of the new medical\nschool. He would also like to encourage more people from his year to be\ninvolved with the SU. He wanted to\nhelp develop a fierce pride for ICSM\namong the new intakes, and saw the\ncurrent post ural gesture adopted by\nsome medics against the rest of the\nCollege as damaging.\nOther posts to be contested include\nVice President Internal, Treasurer,\nSocial Rep, Deputy Social Rep,\nClubs and Societies Rep, Education\nRep, Welfare Rep and Bar Manager.\nDogs on\ncampus\ncontinued from front page\nHospital, will be the responsibility of\nImperial College and will be run\nfrom the South Kensington Campus.\nMobile dog patrols will be a good\nway of keeping in contact with offsite security officers.\"\nIt is planned that the patrols will\nstart at midday at off-campus sites\nand continue until the early hours of\nthe morning.

He was keen to reassure students and staff that \"Though the\ndogs might be considered intimidating by some, they are not there to\nsubdue or attack, they are simply an\nextension of the handler and there to\nprotect them.\" Confident that the\ndogs will reduce crime, Mr Weir\nsaid that \"...with dogs IC will be a far safer place.\"\nfuture.\nHOW TO VOTE\nTo vote you will need:\n1. your union card,\n2. to find a ballot box,\n3. to ask the person\nmanning the box for\nyour ballot paper,\n4. to wait patiently\nwhile they punch your\ncard and cross off your\nname,\n5. a pen (often pr ovid ed),\n6. to mark your first\npreference with a\"1\",7. to mark your next\npreference (if you have\none) with a\"2\",8. to enjoy!\nScots un is to leave NUS\n\n"

Her answers seemed to represent the general consensus of opinion of the medics saying that \"the\nMary's clubs and societies will stay\nindependent, and if they want to\nmerge with their ICU counterparts\nthen they can.\"\nQuestions were raised over the\npossibility of a centralised bar manager who would run all the bars of\nICU, which would include the bar at\nthe Mary's site, was one that brought\nup a many different views, most of\nwhich were her own. When first\nquestioned, she was in favour of the\nproposed system noting that \"we can\nlearn from each other\" about how to\nrun the services, but when the medics\nstated that \"we don't want it\" Clare\nseemed to be lost for words and then\nreplied that maybe the bar could be\nrun by the medics. When later asked\nby Piers Williams, the current\nDeputy President for Finance &\nServices, \"how easy will it be to run\nthe bar once all the administration of\nMary's SU moves to ICU after next\nyear?\", she commented on the need\nof some kind of centralised system,\nchanging her mind for the second\ntime.

The\nimplied threat of being caught by a security officer with a dog acts as a deterrent to the criminal fraternity.\"\nThe imminent merger of the various medical bodies also, Mr Weir\nfeels, provides an argument for\nbringing in the dogs, \"As from the\n1st of August, making sure that\nmerger sites, like the National Heart\nand Lung Institute and St Marys\ncontinued on page four\n\n"

Don't get me wrong Imperial,\nI'm not a polo gi sing for the tent fiasco or for MrC' s occasional shortcomings (for examples see the last 2\nyears of Felix). Certainly not, but\nsoftly softly, catch ey monkey. I don't want to spend too long with the\ntent this week (like most members of\nChemistry and Physics), since I plan\nto cover it and 'related topics' in the\nnext issue. Let me just say that no\none at IC, and I really do mean no\none, has persuaded me that this is\nanything other than a cock of\nimmense proportions, the result of\nmisplaced priorities.\nSpeaking of cock ups, it was disappointing to hear of the demise of\nABA Copytech barely five minutes\nafter it opened. Though I must admit\nI hardly noticed it, let alone used its\nfacilities, the idea seemed, I thought,\nto be a bit shaky. Almost all of what\nit offered could be obtained from\nestablished sources around\nthe College, but\napparently this\nwas not the\nproblem. It was\nnot our end that\nfell flat on its\nface. Being the\narch cynic that I am, I wrongly\nassumed that\nFinance sold\nA BAa dummy,\nwhich could\nhave had nasty\nrepercussions\nfor the various\nplanned ventures around the\ncampus. Phew\nwhat a relief. Ah,\nhang on a minute. Is it not normal\npractice to run checks on companies\nbefore one enters into an agreement\nwith them, so as to avoid being left\nholding the baby. Does IC not use\nthe much-respected Dunn and\nBradstreet for this purpose? Some\ncareless Cafe Express customer muttered in earshot that they were not\n, , used in this\nSimon Baker case. shU rei ys homem ish take? If they\nwere, questions\nneed to be\nasked over the\ncredit agency. If\nnot, someone in\nthe Finance\nDivision may\ncare to inform\nus as to why.\nWhatever the\ncase, it confirms my belief\nthat any\nattempts to\nbuild on the\nincredibly shaky, but con-side r able, foundations of Sherfield are doomed to\nfailure. I know that businesses fold\nfor a variety of reasons, sometimes at\nshort notice, but this has shambles\nscrawled all over it. I cannot believe\nvoice of reason that this misfortune would have happened if proper procedures and due\ndiligence checks had been carried\nout. Invariably in business, nasty surprises are precisely that, the result of\nnot doing your homework properly.\nGiven the planned changes over the\nnext few years, please tell me that\nI 've got it all wrong, Mike Hansen.\nAnd finally, a new departure. Ever\nkeen to tend to your every need, dear\nreader, I thought that it was about\ntime that I offered my assistance in\nplanning those sad moments when\none finds oneself away from\nImperial. That said, even IC's most\nloyal subjects need a break every\nnow and then, and for the first in this\noccasional series, I suggest Istanbul.\nWhat better than to escape from the\nstench of the lab or the drudgery of\nSouthside basement at the end of\nweek and spend a few days in the\nmystical city where East meets West.\nFlights are available from \u00a389,\nthough I understand that some people have been able to negotiate much\nbetter deals recently. A truly marvellous place. You will send a postcard\nif you go, won't you?\nWestminster Eye - Hamish Common\nhi ngs move so\nquickly these\ndays, especially in\nParliament. Labour's spectacular majority\nseems to be going to\nsome ministers' heads already: Prescott joked that\nthe building for the Institute of Civil Engineers\n\"couldn't takes our majority\". Gordon Brown has\nbeen criticised for giving independence to the\nBank of England without seeking the permission\nof Parliament first. Of course a new Government is\nexpected to make its mark quickly, and Labour\nhas, starting a number of fresh initiatives already.\nBut it must remember the difference between\nGovernment and Parliament.\nFor those who are unsure, the difference is fairly simple. People are elected as Members of\nParliament by constituencies around the United\nKingdom, and those MPs may then sit and speak\nin the Commons, and also vote on any legislation\ncoming through it. There are no technical restrictions on which side an MP may vote for. MPs have\na duty to their constituents to examine bills and\nsc rut in is e their content, for which they receive an\nallowance to hire researchers. In practice, MPs\ntake 'the whip' of a particular party when they\narrive in the House, and are expected (but do not\nalways) vote in line with their party's wishes. The\nleader of the party controlling a majority of MPs\nis then invited to form a government by the Queen.\nHe or she then selects ministers - usually from\nParliament, but not always - to run the\nGovernment. The Government does all the running of the country, whereas Parliament makes the\nlaws within which the Government must work.\nThe Government cannot make law, it can be sued\nlike any other organisation, and its decisions can\nbe overruled by a judge. Parliament however is\nsupreme (setting aside the European dimension),\nand cannot be sued or 'argued with' in any way. A decision from Parliament comes from its mem-be rs, not from the Government.\nA dangerous tone was being emitted by the new\nMinister Without Portfolio, Peter Mandelson (pre-vio us ly Labour's spin-doctor-in-chief) when\nbluntly stated \"Labour Members of Parliament\nhave been elected to carry out the manifesto for\nwhich we have received an overwhelming mandate from the public.\" This is broadly true, and\nLabour MPs would be wise not to attempt to\nundermine Labour's central pledges. But MPs\nwho blindly followed what party elders told them\nmay as well be replaced by robots for all the use\nthey will be to anyone. Not all manifestoes are per-fec t, and Labour will naturally wish to introduce\nlegislation on other areas in their five year term.\nThis is where things may become worrying.\nAlready the party have introduced disciplinary\nprocedures for MPs who bring it into 'disrepute'.\nThis heavy-handedness at the top of the party is\nanti-democratic and dangerous for anyone, whatever their political allegiance. Already Mr Blair\nannounced the change in Prime Minister's questions from two 15 minute sessions to one 30\nminute session per week, something that was\nspecifically rejected by the Procedure Committee\n(which is part of Parliament) recently. Other ideas\nespoused by reformers is to change the shape of\nthe seating in the Commons from the opposing\npews to a horseshoe shape, like many other\nParliaments, since they apparently don't like the\natmosphere created by this 'confrontational'\narrangement (it didn't seem much of a problem\nwhen opposing the Government). Some MPs are\ncalling for swift action, in order to have the\nchanges pushed through before the summer recess.\nQuite apart from the abhorrent idea that some\nnaive reformers could change 400 years of tradition in a few weeks, with no discernible benefits, I hope the Labour Party have a long think before\ndiving headlong into fundamentally altering the\nwhole way Parliament works.\nANSWERS TO 1084'S ELIMINATION\na Thousand, Foot;\nb Olive, Tree:\nc Special, Branch;\nd Old, Hand;\ne Pail, Pale;\nf Bucket, Chemistry;\ng Dark, Horse;\nh Cow, Chicken;\ni Yellow, Belly;\nj New, Dehli;\nk Curry, Ingratiate;\n1 - Oil, Well;\nm Red, Sauce;\nn Treasure, Island;\no Crown, Jewels,\nleaving SPICE!\n\n"

A collection of sad alcoholics watching an\nevening of classic British cinema\nincluding 'The Italian Job' and\nMonty Python's'... and now for\nsomething completely different' .\nThis unbounded festival of stupidity\nwas to set the atmosphere for the\nentire holiday.\nA Taxi ride at breakneck speed in\nthe wee small hours took us to\nGatwick airport, where the more\nenthusiastic of us raced in luggage\ntrolleys across the deserted terminal.\nA plane and a train later we found\nourselves in 'El Chorro' (the centre\nof nowhere) only to find an automobile driven by our gracious host, and\nrally driver-wanna bie, Jean, ready to\ntake us further away from anywhere .\nThe climbing started immediately\n(although some more relaxed members of the club decided that they\nwanted to 'acc lim at is e' to the nice\nweather before doing anything too\nstrenuous, ie sunbathing).\nEl Chorro is a small town on the\ntrain line between Malaga and\nSeville and is a popular venue for\nclimbers from all around Europe.\nThe gorge (through which the train\nline winds its way) provides varied\nroutes of all grades for beginners and\nhard-core climbers alike, with routes\nHAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS\nHAIR CUT\n\u00a38.00\nUNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX\nINCLUDES: \u2022 V CONSULTATION with stylist to discuss your style, try\na new look and learn how to manage and control your hair.\nV SHAMPOO followed by Herbal Conditioner and scalp\nmassage.

In addition to climbing, the\nsurrounding hills are excellent for\nmountain biking. A70 year old steel\ncable, stretching diagonally across\nthe gorge provided entertainment and\nphoto opportunities as three members of the club travelled across (at\nthis point please bear in mind that the\ncable is over 100m above a whitewater river and is 150m long).\nSurprisingly enough there were no\nserious casualties during the trip,\n(and all of the minor injuries seemed\nto be focused on James 'a rock fell on\nme' Philips). Our honoured treasurer\ndid some rather impressive shit, and\nwe all cheered. He also fell off, and\nwe cheered again and threw beans at\nhim. Arguably the most epic climb of\nthe trip was a route named ' El Amptrax', graded French 6a( where\n8c is about the hardest climb able). Amptrax was a route that went up the\nhighest part of the rock and took the\nentire day for two pairs of climbers to\ncomplete, and included a dramatic\noverhang on the final pitch.\nNot all of our time was spent being\nmacho, tanned, hard-body types; we\nalso spent some time walking in the\nhills absorbing the beautiful scenery\n(yeah right), as well as swimming\nnaked in the reservoir just north of\nthe upper gorge (no seriously we did,\napart form the naked bit, I lied about\nthat). At this point I would like to say\nthat Belay Bunny only had chips\n(sorry, personal joke, it's very funny,\ntrust me).\nAt the end of the week we were\nloath to leave, but with shortening\nfunds and looming exams we\nreturned home, with improved personal bests and some nice tans.\nWayward bowling costs IC\ncricket first match of season\nTUFFERS\nWhen King's College Hospital finally turned up, three-quarters of an\nhour late, the first miracle this summer occurred when our captain won\nthe toss (a career first), and chose to\nbat.\nThings looked good as our opener\nGraham classically stroked the ball\naround the park, with a borrowed\nbat, showing Mandar (two) that it\ncan be used to score runs. Things\nwent on quietly but steadily, with\nNigel Terry scoring a well-earned\nfifty-three not out, anchoring our\ninnings, and securing Man-of-the Match. Nigel was joined at the crease\nby several rapid innings, keeping the\nruns flowing, from Mikal (fifteen)\nBobby (eight) and Dave (sixteen).\nUnfortunately, we made the cardinal sin of failing to see out our overs,\nbut still put together a creditable one-hundred-and-sixty-one. Then we\nwent to tea - not too bad for\nHarlington, but Bobby we do only\nget allotted one cake each, not three.\nK CH then went out to bat, and we\ntried our best to defend this reasonable target. This would have been a simple task were it not for something\ncalled extras. Come on lads, forty-eight is a little too generous.\nAnything on line was hardly ever hit\nfor runs - but we only took three of\ntheir wickets. The first was bowled\nby Nigel, and caught with lightening\nreactions by Mandar at slip. The next\ntwo went to Dave who finished with\nvery creditable figures of two for\nthirty-five, and rued the dropping of\ntwo catches in his final over. This\nwas the turning point in the match, as\nthe batsman in question went on to\nmake an unbeaten sixty-one.\nPete was unlucky with figures of\neight overs for thirty, which should\nhave included a couple in the wickets\ncolumn. Bobby was also unlucky not\nto pick up a wicket - unfortunately\nthe umpire didn't know the meaning\nof LBW.\nRemove the extras from our bowling and we were tremendous.\n\n"

    "content": "This is not your run-of-the-mill exhibition. Any visitor\nexpecting to see rows of pretty (or not so pretty) paintings\nwill be deeply disappointed. However, if you wan to study\nthe role an artist can play in society, then it is well worth\ntaking a look at the drawings, watercolours and prints of\nthe cartoonist and political satirist George Grosz.\nGrosz, born in Berlin, grew up in a small town\nPomerania, now in Poland. Fascinated by luridly illustrated pulp-fiction, Westerns and adventure stories, he decided to become an illustrator. After a spell at the Art\nAcademy in Dresden, he returned to the Berlin School of\nArts and Crafts in 1912. He was to remain here until the\nadvent of Hitler as German Chancellor, charting the seediness and political corruption in the Berlin of the Weimar\nRepublic and its descent into the grips of the Nazis.\nGrosz early work is that of a non-conformist, a rebel\nagainst the narrow-mindedness of the German Burger.\nHis drawings such as The Lost Happiness Cafe depict the\ndecadent violent side of Berlin, notorious in particular for\nThe Berlin of George Grosz\nExhibition\nits cabarets. The people that stare out of this sketches\nhave a vacant forlorn look in their eyes. There is no hope\nleft in the Berlin that Grosz draws.\nGrosz' political activism developed with his conscription\ninto the army during the first World War. He resented\nauthoritarianism of the officers and their attitude towards\nthe soldiers as cannon-fodder. He returned to Berlin with\na bitter hatred of authority and mankind in general. His\nsense of the macabre futility of war comes to the fore in\nThe Faith Healers which shows an army doctor declaring\na cadaver fit for active service.\nAfter the war, he became a committed member of the\nGerman Communist Party and agitated against the government of the Weimar Republic which to him was just a continuation, under a different name, of the old autocratic\nPrussian system. His political cartoons were published in\nradical journals along with the work of Brecht, Weill and\nTucholsky. Looking at these drawings, you can see why\nthe tradition of political cartoonist still flourishes: Grosz'\nmessage comes across loud\nand clear. I am tempted to say\nthat his work has a further\nreaching effect than that of his\nmore literary fellow communists.\nIn Memory of Rosa Luxembourg\nand Karl Liebknecht for example\nexposes the brutal murder of\nthese revolutionaries by the\nauthorities.\nHowever, Grosz became\nmore and more disillusioned\nwith communism. During a visit\nto the newly created Soviet\nUnion, he saw at first hand the\neffects of communism. Instead\nof an egalitarian society, he\nfound brutal repression, needless violence and censorship\nwhich confirmed his bitter opinion of mankind. His work slowly\nveers away from propaganda\ntowards satirical observation.\nHe records without judgement\npeople going about their lives.\nWith the inexorable rise of Hitler,\nGrosz decided to leave\nGermany for his childhood\n\u2022jr f\",( dream, America.\nThis exhibition charts\nGermany's catastrophic slide\ntowards the Second World War.\nIt also made me realise though\nwhat an immense power the\nmedia has to influence people.\nIt is in a way frightening to think\nthat the work of just one political\nartist can explain and to some\nextent influence the mood of an\nentire nation. Emma\nThe Berlin of\nGeorge Grosz is\nbeing exhibited at\nthe RoyalAcademy\nof Arts, Burlington\nHouse, Piccadilly,\nuntil the 8th June.\nart and theatre\n\n"
