Well done\nColin! Keep up the good work!\n.SVr\nI was appalled when I read your\neditorial in the last issue ol\nFELIX. Many other members of\nCouncil to whom I have spoken\nwere also appalled. We were\nappalled that you eOt il d so\nmisconstrue the facts on which,\nat the end of the day, your ease\nmust rest. It is right and proper\nthat you should point out that a few members of Council do not\nhave the same deep regard for\nthe L'n ion as the rest of us. I, my seM a member of P WP this\n\\ear. have striven to get people\naround the table to establish a meaningful dialogue on many-areas relevant to student life.\nAs for your charge of egocentric it y what pill le!I often talk to\nordinary students and sometimes\nallow them to buy me a drink. In\naddition to accuse members ol\nCouncil of pomposity merits the\nridicule it so fully and justly\ndeserves.\nYou raise the case of Social\nColours awards as a prime example of back-slapping among\nhacks. This is an award, which I note you were not deemed worthy of receiving. I can only\nspeak for myself in stating that I am proud to wear the tie that I know I fully deserve. Also Mr Editor Marshall (I hope that\nengenders enough respect) who\nput forward the Social Colour\nnominations lor FELIX stall,\nsurely 'not yourself, a man ol\ntowering moral principle.\n/ am sir, your obedient servant,\nStephen Goulder\nPW PH on Sec 1980/1\nhit Services Cttee 1980/1\nCouncil 1980/1\nS CC Exec Cttee 1980/1\nR CSU Gen Com m1980/1 Biochem II AcRe p19801RC SAc Affairs Com m1980/1 Social Clubs Com m19801 FELIX Cow Gum Monitor1980/1 U GM Chairman1981/2 SCC: Chairman1981/2 House Committee 1981 2\nUnion Finance Cttee 1981/2\nBookshop Committee 1981/2\nCouncil 1981/2\nRG S Gen Com m19812 Social Clubs Cttee 1981 2\nSocial Chilis Exec Cttee 1981 2\nDear Steve\nI was most interested to read\nyour editorial in last week's FELIX. I found it most amusing,\nas I believe did most students.\nHowever, whilst I find it hard\nto disagree with the general\ntheme of your remarks, I would\nlike to take up a couple of points\nwhere I thought you were slightly\nwide of the mark.\nFirstly, on perhaps a slightly\npetty note, I am interested as to\nwhere you obtain your information about Mr Passmore's time of\narrival in the Union Oflirc. I don't believe you've olten been\nseen in your office before 2:00pm. And how you can have the gall to\ndescribe yourself as a 'serious\nobserver of the Union' is quite\nbeyond me.\nOn a more serious note, I refer\nto your comments on the L^n ion Council. As a member of this\nprestigious body I found myself\nreeling from the sheer verbosity\nof your description ol its honourable members. (I don't have the\npre sump to us ness to assume myself one of your 'few except ions'.) After some thought, however, I realised that not only\nhave you misjudged the situation,\nbut you are wrong as well. (This\nisn't surprising since you've only\nbeen to Council once this year.)\nFar from being 'ego-centric'\nand' pseudo political' most\nmembers display the intelligence.\nskill and concern for their responsibilities of a Southside Chef. Many lit the description of\nbeing boring, apathetic and largely in com pet ant individuals\nwho down gade Council to the\n'rubber-stamping' body that it\noften becomes. They have been\nblind to the ineptitude and esoteric indifference of the Exec,\nand have aided and abetted\n' cooperation' verging on acquiescence with almost every-thing College throws at the\nUnion. There are, however, a few\nexceptions, who could conceivably be described as 'ego-cent ic','p seu* do-political' and' petty fogging' by a cynic such as\nyourself. They are the only effective voice of opposition( apart from your good self) to the\nExec, the main check on their\notherwise unbridled activities. I am pleased to number myself\namongst them.\nfours in ei/o een l rie, pelly jos g ing adversity,\nMartin Taylor\nExternal Affairs Officer\nPS: I thought that all this year's sabbaticals were equally deserving of aUG A( think about it).\nDear S Marshall\nII you are going to slag off\nJohn\" UGA\" Passmore why\nrestrict yourself to idiotic and\ninaccurate backbiting. There are\nmany concrete issues which can\nbe justifiably cited to show his\nlethargy and ineffectiveness as\nICU President\u2014lack of realistic\naction on union policy on C ND and on South African participation in nuclear technology courses; lack of sensitivity to\neveryday issues affecting many\nstudents in College such as\nrefectories and overseas students\nfinancing problems \u2014 to name\nbut a few. If you want to start a reasonable debate on the role ol\nour glorious leader, then let's have some facts to argue about.\nl ours Simon Cox\nGeology PG Ed's Note\nI don't know who you are, but\nyou immediately strike me as a person who's not too hot upstairs,\nif you take my meaning. Where\nwere you when I criticised J Passmore for exactly the things\nyou mention? Probably screwing\na lew of those delectable birds\nfrom WIST, if l'm not very much\nmistaken.\nDear \"Sir\"\nYour paper undulated into its\nlower depths last week in your\nparticularly unpleasant remarks\nabout Rae S nee and Ruth Hildebrand. We are not going to\nquestion as to whether your attacks were justified or not,\nhowever we strongly object to the\nsexist nature ol your comments.\nThe size of breast, the supposedly\n\" un lem in in e\" appearance (\"fat\nand ugly\") do not affect a person's capacity to fulfil a role\nin the Union or express an opinion.\nIf you would like to put forward positive suggestions as to\nwork J Passmore should do, then\nstate them and do not resort to\nidiotic and inaccurate back-biting( haven'tI heard this\nsomewhere before?-Ed.). We object\nto the use of the image of a helpless woman thing being \"petted\" in the Union Office as\npart of your attack. We do not\nhappen to be little furry animals.\nWhilst these \" funny\" remarks\nwere probably slipped in without\nany thought, we ask you to\nreconsider them as they present\nan attack not only on the persons\ndirectly concerned but on all\nwomen in College. Women will\nstand no chance of playing an\nequal role in a society which is\nblinded by the image of women\nas sexual objects.\nNB We are writing in defence\nof women in general and not\nprompted by requests from the\nindividuals concerned here.\nCM> M. WIST Ed s Note\nDoes \" WIST\" stand for \" Wildebeests in Science & Technology\"?\nMost of the people in \" WIST\" seem to be men. Is Simon Cox in\n\" WIST\"?' Sped he's just after a quick let ch, eh, girls?\nDear Steve\nAs the amount of space available\nin FELIX for letters has apparently expanded, I thought that I might actually bother to write in\nthis week. I shall however try to\nkeep the prose simple, as I know-that literacy is not one of your\nstrong points. I have several\nunconnected points to make.\nOne: Why do you sometimes\nprint letters with pseudonyms,\nand at other times refuse to print\nletters because they are signed\nwith pseudonyms?\nTwo: Why do you answer\ncriticism with insults to the critic\nrather than reasoned argument?\nThree: Why do you think social colours are so important?\nFour: Why do you like Liz Lindsay so much? (I ask this out\nol simple curious it y, my only\nexposure to her having been her\nshrill cries \"come back this is\nimportant\" at UG Ms and her\nblatant lies about student housing at the Physics Open Day.)\nFive: Swearing in print is not\nol it sell amusing but has to be\nmade so in context.\nSix: When you ended your\nmost recent editorial \"Assume\nnormal student boring, ineffectual\nlifestyles\" were you addressing\nyourself, your readership or both,\nand wouldn't\" resume\" have\nfitted better?\nAnd finally, Seven: How- come\nContinued on page 6\nPage 2 FELIX, June 5, 1981\n\n"

FIGURES released this week showed another big\njump in the number of abortions performed in\nEngland and Wales. A total of 163,000 abortions\nwere carried out during 1980, a rise of 11%\ncompared to the previous year. Of these only 3\n(0.002%) were carried out in emergency to save\nthe life of the woman and a further 648 (0.4%)\nbecause of risk to the life of the woman. Six out of\nten abortions were performed in profit making,\nprivate clinics.\nDavid Steel claimed in 1967 during the debate\non his Abortion Act that it would not open the\nway to abortion on demand. Sadly, with an\na bore tion performed on average every 3'/\u00ab\nminutes in England and Wales even Mr Steel\nmust admit that abortion on demand has already\narrived in Britain.\nSubwardenship\nApplications are invited from m/f postgraduates\nfor the post of Subwarden in Beit Hall. The duties\nentailed involve assisting the Warden and the\nfemale Subwarden in the organisation of the social\nlife of the Hall and to interact with the resident\ncommunity, their elected committee of representatives and the Hall Bursar to help maintain the\nhighest level of safety, cleanliness and good order\nconsistent with the interests of the community as a whole.\nThe post carries with it self-contained accommodation in the old hostel of Beit Hall.\nApplications should be sent with a brief personal\nhistory to Dr C Halls, Warden, Beit Hall.\nClosing date for applications June 20, 1981.\nEstimates\nAt the last meeting of the College Finance and\nExecutive Committees, the Rectors Policy\nCommittee's proposal to cut \u00a36,000 off our claim\nwas endorsed. This basically means that we're\ngoing to have to have another cutting session at\nUFC, and money is going to be very tight next\nyear.\nSouthside Security\nAt the first U GM this term I reported that the\nEstates Secretary had told me that the work\nwould be finished by May 8. 1 don't know why he\ntold me this, as it hasn't even nearly been\nstarted\u2014he must have been talking about\nsomething else. Anyway, I managed to corner him\nat F&E, and apparently the current situation is\nthat they have a costing of about \u00a37,000, which\nthey think is too much, and bearing in mind the\nproposed alterations to the lower levels of\nSouthside, and the fact that the fire alarms will\nneed rewiring in about twelve to eighteen months\ntime, they want to leave the decision until the\ndefinite future of Southside lower levels in known.\nHe then went on to talk about short-term\nmeasures \u2014 which is absolutely laughable considering we've waited a whole year already. In\nshort, I am totally disgusted that even a rape, at\nknife-point and within earshot of residents, is not\nenough to provoke action on this security\nproblem.\nFreshers' Fair\nForms are now available from Annie in the Union\nOffice, and any clubs and societies who have not\nfilled one in by the end of term will not get a stall.\nKeys Please will all club and society chairman holding\nUnion keys come and see me with their successor\nto pass the key (and deposit) on.\nGliding News\nAS THE ACADEMIC YEAR draws\nto a close the soaring season is just\nbeginning, and all over the country\nglider pilots are coming out of their\nsix month hibernation. IC Gliding\nClub, however, has been active\nthroughout the winter despite some\natrocious weather. Over Christmas\nand the New Year, nine intrepid\nmembers fought their way through\nsnow and blizzard to Portmoak in\nScotland, on the club's annual\nexpedition in search of wave lift,\nwhich resulted in one student\nclimbing to over 14,000ft. Later in\nthe year another member, who,\nincidentally, has been chosen to take\npart in the 'British Team Training'\nthis year, managed a height of over\n20,000ft. Meanwhile, during the spring\nterm, work has proceeded quickly\non the club's newly acquired living\nquarters in Lasham, which had been\nuninhabited for the past two years. It\nhas now been transformed into a very comfortable bunkhouse and\nworkshop for the gliders. Over the\nEaster holidays the weather became\nso arable and members began to fly\noff across country. Two completed\ntheir first cross country flights of\nover 50km to gain their silver C badge, but one, having completed\nhis journey from Lasham (near\nBasingstoke) to Shoreham-by-Sea,\nthen took refuge in a bar while\nawaiting the arrival of his retrieve\ncrew. By the time they did arrive he\nhad 'lost' the glider somewhere in\nthe now pitch black airfield. It was a rather tired party who eventually\nstumbled to bed, back at Lasham, in\nthe early hours of the morning. More\nexperienced pilots have also been\nbusy completing 100km and 300km triangles in our high performance\naircraft.\nThe less experienced pilots have\nnot been forgotten though. Three\ncourses have been arranged for\nthem since the New Year and a fourth is planned for the last week of\nthis term. As a result of the Easter\ncourses, seven pilots, most of whom\nhad had little or no experience of\nflying before coming to IC, have now\nflown solo. By this time next year the\nmore enthusiastic should have\ncompleted their first cross-country\nflight. Nearer in the future, we are\nentering a team in a 'University Task\nWeek'- at Cambridge in the first\nweek of the holidays, in which they\nwill be competing against other\nuniversity gliding clubs in crosscountry racing. Two other pilots will\nbe entering the Lasham and Nympsfield regional s in open competition\nagainst non-university pilots. We\nwish all of them the best of luck, and,\nof course, plenty of good weather,\nand meanwhile remind you that\neveryone is welcome to join the\nGliding Club (including members of\nstaff!). We meet in Aero 254 at\n5:30pm on Thursdays and, although\nmeetings stop over the summer\nvacation, our gliding activities\ncontinue.\nAnn Dziviwior\nCathy Lowe\nWe have just opened near South Ken Station\n(2A Exhibition Road) and are offering a student\ndiscount on all vur food( on production of Unioncard).\nA few sample take-away prices\n1 chicken 5 0 p2 pieces\nchips\ncurry\nrice\napple pie\n_ 8 0 p_20p_80p_30p_20 p etc\n7 : 3 0 \u2014 midnight FELIX, June 5, 1981 Page 7\n\n"

Chelsea\nCollege\nto close?\nTHE S WINNER TON DYER Committee on the academic organisation of London University have recently produced a surprising interim report which\nsuggests that Chelsea College could be closed down. Also, Bedford and Westfield would form a consortium and Royal Holloway would lose its department of physical sciences.\nThe committee are looking lor\nways to cut costs in UL as a result\nof projected reduced income from\noverseas students following the\ngovernment's decision to impose\nfull-cost fees. It is felt that closure\nof a complete school is better\nthan risking academic standards\nthroughout the University. IC, Kings, LSE and University College seem safe from the axe as\nthey come high on the order of\nmerit, although cuts in individual\ndepartments may have to be\nmade.\nThe Committee recognise Chelsea's reputation in science\nand education but are not confident about the rest of the\nCollege. It is stressed that the\nscience section should be pre-served. If the majority of the rest\nof the College is closed, this could\nmean a merger with another school, possibly IC. Prior to the interim report, it\nwas widely thought that QE C would be recommended for closure (it has a large overseas\nstudent population), but the committee says the college is a success. However, if further cuts\nwere to be made, it is suggested\nthat QE C should be eventually\nincorporated into IC. Watch out\netc.\nTHREE STUDENTS have recently had their cheque books\nstolen and everyone is urged not\nto leave their jackets in unattended\noffices etc.\nAn inspection of the forged\nsignatures has revealed that the\nthief was the same in all three\ncases.

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nMore beer money for students?\nMany of you will possibly have read in the Sunday papers about\nthe possibility of obtaining rent rebates if you live in Hall. Very\nfew people seem to have any ideas of the situation as the people\nwho do know are not keen to let on about a possible loophole in\nthe 1980 Housing Act. The following article is by Sue Telling of\nStudent Services and outlines the position up-to-date.\nThe national press, via publicity by the NUS, have drawn the\nattention of many people to a clause in the 1980 Housing Act which\nappears to enable students living in Halls of Residence to apply for rent\nallowances. This sounds like a great way of bolstering grants against\nrising residence fees. But unfortunately there is still a lot of confusion\nabout how different boroughs will respond to claims; how colleges will\nreact to inquiries regarding a breakdown of Hall bills for assessment\npurposes; how, if any test cases are taken to court, lawyers will\ninterpret the relevant clause with regard to individual cases; and\nfinally, if students are granted this allowance, whether or not the\namount of money involved will be worth applying for.\nA Department of the Environment spokesman is reported to have\nconfirmed that students could claim allowances for rent paid in hostel\ntype accommodation. However, the Housing Officer lor Kensington\nand Chelsea seems to have spoken to a different official at the D of E. His information was that people in Halls of Residence would be\nunlikely to qualify since although they fulfill the first part of the\nrelevant clause in the new Housing Act there are aspects ol the second\npart of the clause that could be construed against them. People living\nin hostels can indeed claim, but the official interpretation of a hostel is\none in which people are living in dormitories. The original intent of the\n1980 Housing Act was not apparently to allow students in college\nresidences this opportunity to supplement their grant. The D of E does\nadmit that the whole thing is very woolly and finds it difficult to\npredict just what the final outcome will be. Our local Housing Officer\nseems to think that this borough would turn down such a claim.\nMeanwhile, some boroughs have been actively encouraging students\nto apply. For instance, the Welfare Rights Officer of Greenwich\nBorough Council wrote to Thames Polytechnic Students' Union. However when students did apply the rent allowance office wanted a breakdown from the Polytechnic on what exactly the students were\npaying lor, since the residence fees are heavily sub sidi sed. The accounts department at first estimated that about \u00a31.25 of the normal\n\u00a324.60 was rent. The union contested this finding and it was\nsubsequently admitted that a student'sHall bill could not be item is ed. This would also seem to apply to any IC Residence bill. The Kensington and Chelsea Housing Department meanwhile, take the\nview that the it is not within their jurisdiction to approach the landlord for a breakdown of a bill but take it at face value then apply their\nown analysis of the figures.\nThames Polytechnic Union are still waiting to hear from Greenwich\nBorough Council on their final decision. There is apparently a government directive for boroughs to delay making any payments until\nthe wording of the Housing Act has been more closely scrutinised. If\nthe Union does get a negative reply they intend taking the Borough to\nCourt to fulfill its obligations under the 1980 Housing Act as long as\nthe NUS are prepared to supply the necessary funds. It would seem\nthat a successful test case will be the only way of ultimately getting any\npayments through since boroughs are under great financial pressure at\npresent to abide by central directives.\nIf all this hasn't been enough to dampen anyone's enthusiasm\nperhaps it would be as well to also recall some information given in a previous FELIX article on who can apply for rent allowances and how\nthey are calculated.\nAgreements with a landlord that are described as 'holiday' or\n'company' lets and accommodation that is shared with the landlord\nare all still outside the range of rent allowances. People with 'licenced'\nagreements do now qualify under the new 1980 Housing Act and it is\nalways possible to take a 'holiday let' to the County Court for\nre classification when it is obvious that the tenants are not on\nholiday\nMost boroughs have a different way of working out these allowances\nsince quite a lot of discretion is allowed. The following is a description\nof this Borough's method:\nA25% deduction is usually made for furniture, with a further\namount deducted (up to 25%) if heating is included in the rent. The rate element (approx 25%) is also removed, but this will be subject to its\nown rebate. The basic rebate will be between 20% and 30% of the\nremaining figure. The percentage varies according to the rent payable,\nshrinking as the rent increases. However, if your income is less than\n\u00a334.90 (the single person's housing benefit needs allowance), as it\nnormally will be during the vacation then 25% of the difference\nbetween the income and the needs allowance is added to the basic\nfigure. If your income is more than the needs allowance then the basic\nrate is reduced by 17% of the difference between the income and the\nneeds allowance.\nIf a rate rebate is applicable this part is not subject to any initial\nreductions, but the calculations tend to be even more tortuous without\nproviding a very clear indication of the final outcome.\nIf you apply during term-time however \u00a310 of your rent is ignored in\nthese calculations since this figure is the weekly rent already allocated\nin the grant. For most IC students this will mean that term-time\nallowances just won't be worth applying for. During the short\nvacations however there could be an allowance of between \u00a32 and \u00a36 a week. People living in the College head tenancies are getting around \u00a34\na week. In the past the Student Services Office has recommended this\nallowance lor those who have to pay rent during the Christmas and\nEaster holidays. Unfortunately the Housing Department will not\nconsider any claims made during the summer vacation since living in\nCollege at this time is not regarded by al least one official as being a permanent place of residence.\nIf you do decide to apply for a rent allowance this is how to go about\nit:\n. It's best to phone your Town Hall first to discover their interview\nprocedure and establish just where the relevant office is since it may not\nbe in the main building. Have all the nee es ary identification, proof of\nrent and bank statement with you for anything missing will mean\nanother visit and possibly lost rebate since it only begins when they\nhave established the relevant facts.\nIf in the end you are refused payment, contact the Student Services\nOffice, 15 Princes Gardens, since they may have news of developments\nin other boroughs which could possibly be used in negotiations with\nKensington and Chelsea.\nNo587 Friday, June5,1981 Free!

    "content": "Montezuma's Revenge\nor Turkey Trots\nBy Dr Tony Haines\nThe Editor of FELIX rang me to request an article on in no cul at ions, etc., that people\nmay require for going abroad. I have hastened to comply with his request. Who\nknows, if I didn't he might send round one of his reporters to do the sort of hatchet\njob he's already done on Mr Mooney and our representative of the Navy.\nI suspect that he only rang to ask for this article so he could tap me for information\nabout his own trip to South America, and wanted an excuse to ring. Anyway, I thought, as I noted down details, I could always ask Dr Addenbrooke to do the\n\"needful\".\n\"How many words do you want?\" I asked him firmly. Editors, Ifeel, like to be asked\nthese questions; it fills them with a sense of importance. \"As many as you like,\" he\nsaid flatteringly, pressing on to make further enquiries about South America.\nBefore taking time out to trot down the\ncorridor to ask Dr Addenbrooke if she would\nwrite the article, or, at least, update her\noriginal one on im munis at ions, I wondered for\na brief moment whether he was, in fact, being\nsent to South America by John Passmore, or\neven by the Rector, or was he just going on his\nown accord, for a jaunt?\n1 broached the project with Dr Addenbrooke;\nshe eyed me with a rather baleful look, and\nsaid \" You must be joking,\" in that inimitable\nway she has of dealing with what she considers\nto be my more futile requests.\nI am desperately staring at the few notes\nthat 1 wrote while contemplating the editor's trip \u2014 enforced or otherwise \u2014 to South America. (Do you think they'll allow him to\ninterview Biggs?)\nThere are, I suppose, two approaches to\nim munis at ions. I always play safe with the\nRector before he goes abroad, and by the time\n1 have finished with him, he resembles a sort of\nrector i al pin-cushion. I feel my reputation will\nsuffer if he comes back with any malaise, let\nalone a dread disease I might have been able to\nprevent.\nMr Smith, our secretary, on the other hand,\nis a seasoned traveller who has, no doubt, had\nhis share of in no cul at ions. He keeps me firmly\nat bay, allowing no nurse to get her cold hands\non him to insert the dreaded needle. He just\ntakes his anti-malarial tablets.\nMalaria\nI have already written about malaria and\npointed out that this is becoming the scourge\nof our time. Attempts at control have not been\nsuccessful. You must take your anti-malarial\ntablets. Contact the College Health Service.\nImmunisations\nThere are, today, few im munis at ions, apart\nfrom yellow fever, that you must have done\ngoing abroad. The details of what you need for\neach country is shown in an appendix which\nLeo Laboratories Ltd and the medical paper\n' Doctor' have very kindly allowed me to\nreproduce. You can also check with the airline\nand the embassy of any exotic country you\nmay be visiting (Ed please note). The advice\nmay be conflicting!\nVeHou; Fever: valid ten years.\nDone at:\n1) British Airways Victoria Air Terminal Immunisation Centre, Buckingham Palace Rd,\nSW1. Tel: 834-2323.\n2) Hospital for Tropical Diseases, St Pancras\nWay, NW1. Prompt attendance 11:30am, Monday to Friday.\nA charge will be made.\nCholera: valid six months only.\nOne injection only, and this should be given\nseven to ten days before departure. Very few\ncountries require an international certificate\nfor cholera today, although the World Health\n.Organisation recommend that you have this\nXor a great many countries\u2014and you may be\nasked for a certificate if an attack breaks out.\nIt is quite easy to buy a false certificate,\nalthough often cheaper to have the real\ninjection, if abroad!\nMonovalent Typhoid: valid three years, if\nyou have the first two jabs at least one month\napart, otherwise valid only one year.\nThe old TAB jab much loved in the army\nagainst typhoid and paratyphoid A&B looks\nlike being discontinued.\nThe paratyphoid A&B part of the injection\nwas not very effective and was also the\ncomponent which caused people to have sore\narms, temperatures, and feel generally\" gro tty\". The mona valent typhoid is more\neffective, and is less likely to cause an upset,\nalthough you are advised to keep off the booze\nthe night you've had it.\nPoliomyelitits: length of protection uncertain.\nThis is given in the form of drops\u2014your tender\nskin can remain un punctured. Most people\nhave had adequate im munis ation as a child,\nwith a booster at twelve\u2014if they have been\nwise enough to go to state schools.\nIf you are going outside Europe, it would be\nadvisable to have a booster, especially if it is\nover five years since your last one, but not if\nyou are pregnant.\nTetanus Toxoid: valid for approximately five\nto ten years.\nAgain, most people have been injected\nagainst tetanus, and require a boost every\nfive/ten years. A primary course is three\ninjections, the first two being six/twelve weeks\napart and the third being six/twelve months\nlater. You will be well advised to have this\ndone, and also to keep a record in your\npassport when you are due for your next\nbooster. Remember, also, that England is\ncertainly one of the places where tetanus\nspores abound, as well as in Northern Europe.\nRabies If you are going to work collecting animals that\ncould be affected by rabies, or meet up with\nany rabid animal, you should be im munis ed against this. This is a fairly new injection and is\navailable at: British Airways Victoria Air Terminal Immunisation Centre, Buckingham\nPalace Rd, SW1. Tel: 834-2323. By appointment only.\nThe injection is, I believe, quite ex penis ve, and costs \u00a35. A few of our intrepid staff may\nfind themselves working with rabid animals as\npart of their jobs, in which case the College will\nreimburse the cost of this.\nGamma Globulin: lasts about three months\nonly.\nNot an im munis ation, but a pooled por fi on or Delhi-Belly\nfrom other people's serum which gives short\nterm protection against some infections,\nespecially infective hepatitis. If you are\ntravelling rough\u2014maybe taking the \"hippy\ntrail\" to meet a guru in North India (I wonder\nwhy the editor isn't doing this\u2014although I suppose that after his exchanges with Dave\nAfolabe, he may not feel this need to meet a guru), then it would be advisable to have an\ninjection of gamma glob ul in as near to your\ndeparture date as possible. This will give you\nsome, although not total, protection against\ninfective hepatitis, which is an extremely nasty\nillness and may make you feel unwell for quite\na long time. It may also give you some protection for a limited period against viral\ninfections, although certainly not for long\nagainst a common cold.\nYou may think that by the time you have\nhad all this, you will be in no fit condition to do\nyour examinations, and you could be right!\nHowever, I'm not too keen on issuing everybody with certificates to say their work\nhas been handicapped by pre-travel sickness.\nSo that when the editor asked me how soon\neveryone should start, then the answer is,\nperhaps,\" yesterday\" or \" last month\". Anyway, get it done soon.\nMountain Sickness\nPerhaps, as I have been given unlimited space,\n1 should say a word about mountain sickness,\nin case the editor is climbing on his South\nAmerican trip. There have been recent suggestions in the medical press that a drug\ncalled Diamox prevents mountain sickness.\nThere is no adequate research evidence to\nback this up.\nThe basic rules of mountaineering at high\naltitude is that one climbs slowly to 10,000ft. You can then climb up to 15,000ft the next\nday, but should sleep at 11,000ft. The following\nday you can go up to 17,000ft, but should sleep\nat 12,000ft, and this is called the \"climb high,\nsleep low\" policy.\nIf having reached 10,000ft you try to press\non to fast, and sleep at 12,000ft the first night\nand 14,000ft the next night, a member of the\ngroup may run into mountain sickness.\nThis may not be the most unfit member. A doctor from Birmingham said that when their\ngroup tried to press on fast, during the night at\n14,000ft, one member of their group became\nunconscious. His advice was that one should\nalways have a yak handy, as these can run you\ndown the mountain fairly quickly, and this is\nthe cure.\nI hope our gallant editor will not have to be\nrun down the mountain on a yak, which sounds rather undignified, and should heed my\nadvice to \"climb high and sleep low\".\nAt the end of this article is the map, but\nrather than trying to sort it out for yourself the\neasiest way is to come along and see one of the\nnurses (Jean Chapman was working at British\nAirways before coming here\u2014so we are all\nkept in order) to get some advice, about\nexactly what you will need for your trip.\nI do hope you are all having a lovely long\nsummer holiday, a long way away in Peru,\nIndia or some other exotic place, and especially that you will be away for August,\nwhen doctors Addenbrooke and Gillon will\nboth be away, and I shall be left on my own, so\nbe warned!\nBon Voyage.\nFELIX, June 5, 1981 Page 3\n\n"

To while away odd moments aboard the Star\nShip Enterprise, there's nothing Mr Spock\nenjoys more than a game of dominoes. But\nCaptain Kirk disapproves of such frivolity, and\nwith a single blast of high-intensity cosmic\nenergy from his ray gun he has welded Mr Spock's dominoes into a solid block. Can you\nhelp Spock by showing him where to cut the\nblock to get his set of dominoes back?\n0 5 4 1 6 1 3 4\n0 6 2 1 5 1 3 0\n3 4 4 2 5 6 4 4\n0 0 6 0 6 6 1 1\n6 3 5 4 5 2 0 3\n3 4 5 2 3 2 1 3\n5 2 6 5 0 1 2 2\n(In a full set of dominoes, of course, there is\njust one of every possible pair of numbers from\n0 to 6, including doubles.)\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o FELIX Office.

Many people seemed to think the answer\nobvious, although they had a little difficult\nfinding a numerical example. For my part, I neither understand nor believe the result; the\nfigures are there, unquestionably correct, but\nthe more I think about them, the more baffled I get.\nThere won't be a FELIX next week; Steve's saving his pent-up malice for one last outburst\nbefore he seeks asylum in South America, and\nso the next Scaramouche will be the puzzle\npage in the last issue of term, so write in and\nsay what you want me to include, what sort of\npuzzles you enjoy, what sort you don't enjoy,\nwhether you like them easy or difficult, and\nwhether you want answers in the edition, or if\nyou' d prefer them kept till October. The disadvantage of that, of course, is that third\nyears and others who are leaving won't get the\nanswers at all (unless they have a subscription\nfor FELIX'.-see Editorial). But on the other\nhand, I always feel that if the answers are included in the same issue, people who would otherwise try the puzzles are tempted to turn straight\nto the solution, and so I tend to be less inclined\nto put lots of thought into setting them.\nAlso, if anyone wants to set a puzzle for the\nsummer page, they are more than welcome to\ndo so; I 'll need it as soon as possible, and\ndefinitely no later than 5:30pm, Monday, June\n15.\nIn any event, if you've attempted any of the\npuzzles over the year, write to me now; my\norange box in the FELIX Office is emptied\nregularly whether there's a puzzle current or\nnot, so send your views even if you can't do\nthis week's puzzle.\nBut do try it.
