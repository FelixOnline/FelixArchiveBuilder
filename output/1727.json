    "content": "Werther at the Royal Opera House\nT\nhe opening night\nof Werther was a\nbeautiful master-piece, however\nit was underwhelming\nat times. Massenet\u2019s\nWerther, based on\nGoethe\u2019s Die Leiden des\nJungen (The Sorrows\nof Young Werther), is a\nclassic story of two star-crossed lovers \u2013 whose\nlove brings sorrow to both\nthemselves and the people\naround them.\nThe Royal Opera House\nwas filled with a vibrant\nand excited atmosphere\nas people came to see the\nfamous Peruvian tenor\nJuan Diego Fl\u00f3rez cast as\nWerther opposite Isabel\nLeonard as Charlotte.\nDespite the buzzing atmosphere of the theatre,\nthe ambience of the entire\ntheatre changed as soon as\nthe curtains were opened.\nThe excited anticipation\ninstantly changed to\nintrigue as the stage was\nrevealed. The first act\ncommences with the Bailli\nteaching his children\nthe cheerful \u201cNo\u00ebl!\nJ\u00e9sus vient de na\u00eetre\u201d as\nthey frolic around the\ngrand but realistic set.\nBefore the audience meet\nWerther for the first time,\nwe are greeted with his\nominously large shadow\napproaching on the door\nof the Bailli\u2019s house.\nWhen Charlotte and\nWerther finally meet, the\naudience expect this elec-trifying, almost tangible\nconnection between the\ntwo lovers \u2013 however\nI found this aspect to\nbe missing throughout\nmost of the performance.\nWe learn of the death\nof Charlotte\u2019s mother\nand Charlotte\u2019s promise\nto marry Albert despite\nher feelings for Werther.\nWhilst this production is\nmeant to be a tale of their\nforbidden love, it seems\nmore like an obsession\non the part of Werther\ntowards Charlotte, with\nhim even appearing to\nthrow a tantrum at the end\nof Act II when Charlotte\nmarries Albert.\nNevertheless, as\nthe production drew\nto a close, the feelings\nbetween the two lovers\nbecame more apparent.\nThe turning point in the\nopera was where Charlotte finally admits her\nlove for Werther after\nreading his letters. When\nshe runs after him, the\ndrawing room doors burst\nopen into a beautiful night\nsky \u2013 filled with beautiful\namber hues that looked\nlike burning embers\nfalling through the sky.\nThe realistic yet extravagant set was replaced\nwith a vast, endless sky\nthat highlighted and\nemphasised every action\nand lyric performed by\nthe two lovers. When\nCharlotte finds Werther\nagain in the final act, the\naudience sees Werther\nalone in his blood-stained\nshirt in his apartment with\nthe burning embers still\nvisible in the night sky.\nHis apartment, initially off\ninto the distance slowly\napproached the front of\nthe stage \u2013 drawing the\naudience in to find out\nmore.\nThroughout the per-formance, there was no\ndoubt about the talent\nof each of the performers \u2013 the singers, as\nwell as the orchestra, all\ndelivered an outstanding\nshow. Although if I am\nbeing perfectly honest,\nthe orchestra completely\nDon Giovanni\nK\nasper Holten\u2019s\ntech-heavy Don\nGiovanni has\nbeen trotted out\non the ROH stage for the\nthird time. The eye-catch-ing set is unquestionably\nthe most remarkable thing\nabout this production.\nUnfortunately, it detracts\nfrom, rather than adds to,\nthe performance, leaving\none wondering where\nHolten\u2019s priorities lie.\nInspired by Escher\u2019s\nlabyrinthine illusions,\nEs Devlin\u2019s set places\nthe story of licentious\nseducer Don Giovanni\nin a series of rooms that\nmorph and shift endlessly.\nThe revolving rooms and\nstaircases convey a sense\nof clandestine meetings,\nendless corridors and\nsexual subterfuge - in\nshort, the atmosphere of\nDonGiovanni.LukeHalls\u2019\nvideo designs breathe life\nto the architecture with an\never-changing backdrop,\nchoreographed precisely\nonto the moving set. Red\nsplotches of blood for the\nCommendatore\u2019s death;\nblue summer skies for\nDon Giovanni\u2019s false\ntales of seduction; black,\ntreacly teardrops when\nDon Ottavio sings of the\ntears of Donna Anna.\nIt\u2019s quite a stunning light\nshow but also rather like\nwatching a giant mood\nring display the overall\natmosphere of the opera at\nany one time, which gets a\nbit annoying.\nHolten, known for\nhis controversial interpretations of operas, has\ncleverly de-victimised\nDon Giovanni\u2019s con-quests. Rather than being\na helpless maiden, this\nDonna Anna is a willing\nand manipulative ac-complice, cavorting with\nDon Giovanni even as\nshe commands fiancee\nDon Ottavio to avenge\nher honour. Zerlina, the\nnewlywed bride who is\nthe next to catch Don\nGiovanni\u2019s eye, is also no\nsimple-minded country\ngirl. Her accusation of\nrape at the end of Act 1\nis transformed into a ploy\non her part, with Zerlina\nripping her bodice and\ncrying for help before Don\nGiovanni ever touches\nher.\nA pity then that the\nperformances were so\nwooden. There was hardly\nany chemistry or dramatic\ntension on stage - characters appeared, sang their\nlines and disappeared\noff into the wings again.\nMalin Bystr\u00f6m as Donna\nAnna bitterly lamented\nher father\u2019s death - from\nabout three feet away and\nfacing the opposite direc-tion. There was a severe\nlack of eye-contact, the\nsingers choosing to sing\nat the audience rather than\nto each other. Where was\nthe heat and passion of the\nrakish Don Giovanni, or\nthe tormented vengeful-ness of the jilted Donna\nElvira? Despite the\nremarkable voices of the\nsingers, everything felt\nvery forced. Combined\nwith the set, it felt like we\nwere watching puppets\npop out of a painted music\nbox to deliver their lines\nat the prescribed times.\nThis is terribly unfair\non the cast, who are in\nthemselves really rather\ngood. Erwin Schrott, in the\ntitular role of unrepentant\nsinner Don Giovanni,\nis a commanding, hon-ey-voiced bass-baritone\nwhose potential seems to\nbe unlocked only in the\nfinale. As he rails against\nthe spirit of the Commendatore, steadfastly\nunrepentant till the end,\nthe defiance and courage\nof our antihero Don\nGiovanni finally comes\nthrough. Indeed, most\nof the cast only shone as\ncharacters in the second\nact when the set was less\nfussy and they had the\nstage to themselves. One\nexception was the comic\ncouple, Zerlina (Louise\nAlder) and Masetto\n(Leon Ko\u0161avi\u0107), whose\nnatural interactions and\nstrong singing made them\nwelcome relief from the\nsomewhat unconvincing\nmelodrama panning out\nthroughout the first act.\nPerhaps one can put it\ndown to opening night and\nthe cast not having settled\ninto their roles or the dis-orientingly kaleidoscopic\nset. But for whatever\nreason, this Don Giovanni\njust didn\u2019t do it for me. It\nis a pretty music-box of a\nproduction, but the drama\nand emotion seem to have\nbeen sacrificed for fancy\nlight tricks.\nISSUE 1672\nFELIX\n22\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWorth it to see Werther?\nARTS\nBernadette\nFernandes\nArts Writer\nWhere?

It\u2019s a hot topic\nright now, especially at\nuniversities. You often\nread horror stories about\nwelfare issues at universities in the news, and\nmany have been forced to\ntake emergency measures\nto protect their students\nin response to these. It\u2019s\nvery much on the agenda\nof many institutions, including Imperial College,\nbut what does it all really\nmean?AstheDeputyPres-ident (Welfare), as well\nas working to improve\nthe welfare of students,\nI think it\u2019s crucial that I\ncommunicate with you\nall about issues going on\nto bust myths, set straight\nfalse perceptions, raise\nawareness about support,\nand keep you in the loop\nabout various welfare\nrelated topics. This section\nin Felix is plays a big role\nin this. It\u2019s a place where\nall students can write\nabout things important to\ninform their peers about,\nand where your reps \u2013 be\nit Liberation and Community Officers, or Welfare\nOfficers \u2013 can talk about\ntopics involved in their\nremits.\nStarting with the basics,\nlet\u2019s define what \u2018welfare\u2019\nmeans: \u201cthe good fortune,\nhealth, happiness, pros-perity, etc., of a person,\ngroup, or organisation\u201d\nsays dictionary.com, and\nthat pretty much sums it\nup. It\u2019s all the things that\ncome together such that\nyou are faring well \u2013 this\ncan mean different things\nto different people, and\neveryone has a different\nway of defining when\nthey\u2019re faring well, and\nwhen they\u2019re not. University, for many, is the\nplace where they start\nproperly discovering\nwhat welfare means to\nthem. Transitioning into\nadult life paired with the\npressure of university\nresponsibilities can be a\nbig strain on your welfare.\nAt Imperial, the workload\nis high and, let\u2019s face it,\nwe\u2019re the biggest bunch of\nover-achievers you\u2019ll find,\nso this strain can be especially intense as we pile\non the pressure to reach\nthe heights of academic\nattainment we\u2019re used to\nreaching before coming\nhere. Sounds like a bit of\na bleak picture, but don\u2019t\npanic, it doesn\u2019t have to\nbe so. Doing a degree at\nImperial doesn\u2019t have to\nbe a painful rite of passage\n\u2013 take it from someone\nwho\u2019s already done their\n4 years! Whilst undoubtedly a certain level of\ndedication to studies\nis required to succeed,\nanyone can enjoy their\ntime here, engage in extra\ncurricular activities, have\nthat ever-elusive social\nlife.\nNone of that is to say\nthat achieving this is\neasy, in fact it can often\nbe very difficult. That\u2019s\nwhy, between the Union\nand the College, there\nare hundreds, if not thou-sands, of people working\nto help students attain\nthe best welfare they can.\nI\u2019m just one of them. The\nYour new welfare officer // Union\nI lead two networks of\nstudent volunteers: the\nWellbeing Representation\nNetwork consisting of\nnearly 100 student reps\nacross College who represent the welfare needs\nof students, and organise\nevents to build commu-nities. I also lead eight\nLiberation and Community Officers who represent\nthe four \u2018traditional\u2019 underrepresented liberation\nareas (LGBT+, Black and\nMinority Ethnic, Disabilities, and Gender Equality)\nas well as four community interests and groups\n(International students,\nInterfaith students, Ethics\nand Environment, and\nMental Health). They run\nevents and campaigns to\nensure the rights and raise\nthe voices of these groups,\nas well as building their\ncommunities at Imperial.\nOn the College\u2019s side,\nthere\u2019saplethoraofpeople\nresponsible for welfare.\nIn your departments, you\nhave your personal tutors,\nyour senior tutors, and a\nvariety of pastoral staff\nmembers. In the central\nCollege, there\u2019s the\nStudent Support Services\nwho provide central\nsupport like the Disabilities Advice Service, the\nCounselling Service, the\nMental Health Service,\nthe Student Financial\nSupport Service, etc. You\neven have wardens and\nsub-wardens if you\u2019re\nliving in Halls. You\u2019ll\nnever be able to remember\nevery single person who\ncan help you (heck, even\nI don\u2019t), but it\u2019s important to remember that\nsomeone can help you if\nyou need it. Never let an\nissue get really bad before\nyou let someone know\nabout it. And, if you don\u2019t\nknow where to go to get\nhelp, someone (be it your\nwellbeing rep, or your\npersonal tutor, or anyone\nelse with a wellbeing\nremit) will be able to point\nyou in the right direction.\nAs I ascend onto my\nsoapbox, there\u2019s just one\ntakeaway I want to make\nsure comes out of this\narticle. Your welfare is\nimportant, and it\u2019s totally\nin your power to fare\nwell at Imperial. It might\nnot always be easy, but\nthere are so many people\nworking every day to\nmake it easier \u2013 and there\nwill always be someone\nto reach out to when it\u2019s\nparticularly hard. The perception of university life,\nespecially Imperial life,\nbeing painful is rife, but\nit doesn\u2019t have to be so.\nUnion deals more with\nthe representation side.\nThe Deputy President\n(Welfare) is the chief\nstudent rep who is responsible for all things welfare\nat the Union \u2013 I work full\ntime to represent students\nand champion equality,\ndiversity and inclusion.\n\u201cDoing a\ndegree at\nImperial\ndoesn\u2019t\nhave to be a\npainful rite of\npassage\u201d\n\u201cYour welfare\nis important\nand it\u2019s totally\nin your power\nto fare well at\nImperial\u201d\nWork hard, but have fun \u2013\nand keep your welfare at\nthe forefront of what you\ndo, however you choose\nto define it.\n\n"

This week,\nit\u2019s a slightly mushy, over-ly-sentimental, prose-style\nversion of every awful\npiece of third-rate poetry\nyou have ever read. Bad\nmetaphors abound.\nA new year, a new\nFelix, and a new cohort\nof students to join the\nImperial community.\nIt\u2019san exciting time \u2013 although the dreariness of\nthe weather has somewhat\ndetracted from theener-gised vibe, as the primary\nsensations of life become\nthe squelching of feet in\nsoaked-through shoes\nand the irksome dripping\nsound of wet umbrellas\ndumped in room corners.\nBeing from the UK,\nrain isn\u2019t anything new.\nAs many international\nstudents will learn orhave\nlearned, most British stereotypes are a load of nonsense \u2013 but the incessant\ndrizzlingof half-hearted\nrain day-in and day-out is\na depressingly real fact of\nlife, as is our tendencyto\nmoan about it ceaselessly.\n\u2018Welcome Week\u2019,\nindeed \u2013 it seems the\nclouds don\u2019t ascribe to\nthe concept of a warm-welcome. Still, we should\nnot let that dampen our\nspirits. Felix is here, and\nthis is my littlewelcome\nto you.\nFor those of you who\nare returning students:\nyou know that we\u2019ve done\naward-winningwork in\nthe past. We will maintain\nthat high standard this\nyear, and that standard ap-pliesacross every section\nof the paper. Whether you\njust like the Puzzles and\nCentrefold or areone of\nthose who avidly reads the\nNews section every week\nto keep up with college\nevents,we will strive to\nexcel.\nFor those of you who\nare just joining us: a\nsignificant portion of this\nissue of Felix is dedicated\nto welcoming you and\nintroducing you to a few\nof the core organisations\nyou\u2019ll beinteracting with\nover the next year. The rest\nhas been put together with\nheart and passionby the\nFelix team before the term\nhas even started, giving\nyou a taste of what is to\ncome from each section\nthroughout the year.\nThe team this year are\na smashing bunch. As one\n\u2018fish out of water\u2019 \u2013 in a\nnew role and tackling\nnew challenges as Editor-in-Chief \u2013 speaking to\nall the freshers out there\nwho are moving from\nsmall ponds back home\nto a very large pond here\nat Imperial: I can tell\nyou that you won\u2019t find a\nbetter and more dedicated\ngroup of students than the\nFelix editorial team. I\u2019m\nalso proud to say that we\nhave a lot of new students\nalready joining the team,\nallof whom are already\ncontributing to and getting\ninvolved with the Imperial\ncommunity.\nI can tell you from\nexperience that coming to\nImperial is an opportunity\n\u2013 academically, yes,but\nalso in terms of holistic\nwellbeing. London is,\nspeaking frankly, pretty\nawesome, andthere are a\nplethora of societies and\nclubs and organisations\nyou can get involved with\nhere. These will give you\nnew experiences, open\nyour mind to new possi-bilities, and help shape\nyou as a person and a\nstudent during your time\nhere.\nAs a note to remember\nin the coming week, when\nyou may be overwhelmed:\nyou\u2019re notalone. I\u2019m\nexperiencing new things\ntoo. For example: the cen-trefold of Felix is usually\na semi-nude photo of a\nsociety. Tradition dictates\nthat the Editor-in-Chief\nstars in the first issue. Yes\n\u2013 this week, I experienced\nfor the first time a naked\nphotoshoot, and can now\ndiehappy knowing that\na picture of my bottom\nwill forever be part of the\nBritish Library (where\nevery issue of Felix is\narchived.)\nThe process of learning\nand growing never really\nstops. I used to think that\none day I\u2019d be an \u2018adult\u2019\nat long last and everything\nwould make a bit more\nsense. I\u2019m 23 now, have\nbeen at Imperial on-and-off for five years, and I\nstill don\u2019t have a clue. My\n18 th and 21 st birthdays\nmeant nothing \u2013 I didn\u2019t\nwake up the next day\nhaving any more of a\nclue than I had drinking\nthe night away prior to\nsleeping. I\u2019m becoming\never-more convinced\nthat we have all been\ndeceived, and that really\nwe all stay young forever\nin our minds.\nYou\u2019ll possibly experience the same feeling\nthroughout this year.\nCertainly at points you\u2019ll\nfeel a little bit panicked\n\u2013 perhaps while pumping\nout the worst piece of\nwork you\u2019ve ever dared\nto submit at 4am and\nslowly realising that you\nmight have to change your\nexpectations of your own\nperfectionism, an experience I went through approximately ten thousand\ntimes during my degree.\nWhen that happens,\njust remember: we\u2019re all\njust fishes jumping into\nthe same boat, flapping\naround, and wondering\nwhen the rain will start to\npour so that we can take\nan easy breath.\nPerhaps the weather is\na warmer welcome that\nperhaps I first realised.\n\n"

Now in\nmy fifth year, people tend\nto be shocked when they\nhear how often I get to go\nto the theatre, and assume\nI am a drug lord. The truth\nis, I have a few go-to\nstrategies to ensure I get\nthe best deal possible for\nevery show, most of which\nare only possible because\nI am a student. Read on\nfor some these tips and\ntricks , which will help\nyou save some money and\nenjoy the wonders that\nthe London theatre scene\n(pun intended) offers.\nFelix Arts (FREE!)\nYes, number one on\nmy list is none other\nthan Felix, the Imperial\nCollege student paper,\nthe one you\u2019re reading\nright now. A majority\nof the articles in the\narts section of Felix are\nreviews of plays, musicals\nand exhibitions (although\nwe welcome any kind of\ncontribution if you feel\nlike it). Twice a month,\nwe post a list of press\ntickets made available for\nus to review for upcoming\nperformances and exhibitions on our Facebook\ngroup (predictably titled\nFelix Arts 2019/20). The\nmembers of the group\nthen get to claim the press\ntickets for free. All we ask\nfor in return is a review\nto be published in print\nand online. There is no\nminimum participation\nquota, and as long as you\nreview what you\u2019ve seen,\nyou can participate as\noften as you like, and as\nmuch as you like!\nRush Tickets\nTodayTix is a must-have mobile application\nfor any London-based\ntheatre enthusiast. Not\nonly do they frequently\noffer good deals on\ntickets, they release\ntickets for select shows\nat 10am each day, for that\nday\u2019s performance(s),\nallowing two tickets per\ncustomer. These tend to\ncost \u00a320, and get snatched\nup quickly, as there is only\na limited number avail-able. To maximise your\nchances, I recommend\nturning the notifications\non for the Rush Tickets\nyou\u2019re interested in. This\nwill allow the app to send\nyou a reminder shortly\nbefore 10 am. As long as\nyou are ready to add the\ntickets to your basket, you\nshould be all set. Sometimes it\u2019s worth hanging\naround on the Rush\nTickets page as any tickets\nfrom other users\u2019 baskets\nfor which the transactions\nweren\u2019t completed get\nrecycled into circulation.\nAs of now, Waitress,\nCome From Away and\nFiddler on the Roof are\nonly some of the shows\nthat participate in Rush\nTickets, but the selection\nupdates frequently.\nLottery\nThere are different\ntypes of lotteries which\ntendtovaryinpricepoints,\nmethods, and chance of\nactually winning tremen-dously. TodayTix runs\ndaily lotteries for various\nplays where you can apply\nto win cheap premium\ntickets (these tend to be\nat about \u00a320) throughout\nthe morning for the day\u2019s\nperformances. I have\nnever actually got tickets\nthis way, but there is no\nharm in trying. TodayTix\nalso runs some weekly\nlotteries, most prominently for Harry Potter\nand the Cursed Child,\ncalled the Friday Forty,\nallocating 40 tickets per\nperformance for \u00a320 per\npart (i.e. \u00a340).\nSome shows run their\nown lotteries on their\nwebsite, such as Book of\nMormon, who also carry\nout a daily lottery in front\nof the theatre box office.\nDay Tickets\nNow becoming a bit\nold-fashioned, some\ntheatres ask patrons\nto queue early in the\nmorning for a chance to\nobtain cheap, last minute\ntickets. These do tend to\nbe very cheap. Be aware,\nthough, that these are sold\non a first-come-first-serve\nbasis, meaning people\ntend to queue at ungodly\nhours, especially for\nshows that are sold out or\nvery expensive through\ntheir general release, such\nas Hamilton. Finally, note\nthat occasionally, these\nare standing tickets. As\nlong as you don\u2019t mind\nstanding up for 2.5 hours,\nseeing Hamilton for \u00a310\nreally doesn\u2019t sound like a\nbad deal.\nAdditionally, although\nnot technically any\ncheaper than face value,\nit is not uncommon for\ntheatres to sell return\ntickets shortly before a\nperformance at the box\noffice. This has proven to\nbe an effective strategy\nfor me to see shows that\nare otherwise sold out\nsuch as Fleabag and The\nCursed Child.\nStudent and Youth\nMemberships\nSome theatres run\nspecial schemes for\nstudents, which has been\na complete game changer\nfor me. Most importantly,\nNational Theatre\u2019s Entry\nPass scheme (which is\nfree to sign up for) for\nthose between 16 and 25\nprovides an allocation\nof \u00a37.50 tickets (\u00a310 for\nguests, who also need\nto be between 16 and\n25) to every one of their\nproductions. Additionally,\n45 minutes before each\nperformance, National\nTheatre allows those with\na valid student card to\npurchase any remaining\ntickets for \u00a315, regardless\nof their original price tags.\nA similar scheme is\npresent within the English\nNational Opera titled\n\u201cAccess All Arias\u201d which\nprovides cheap tickets\nto the opera. (\u00a330 in the\nstalls, \u00a320 in the dress\ncircle and \u00a310 in the upper\ncircle).This scheme is also\nfree to join, and anyone\nbeloww 30 years-old or\nthose enrolled in full-time\neducation can apply.\nGo Live\nFinally, an online\nscheme called Go Live\n(previously known as\nWest End for 10) releases\n\u00a312 tickets for at least\ntwo shows a month! The\norganisation is currently\nundergoing significant\nchanges, therefore keep\nyour eyes on their new\nwebsite when it is finally\nlive to see what they are\nup to.\nSo, I think not only is\nthis more than enough\nevidence that the West\nEnd can in fact be accessible to all, I hope it encourages you to try some\nof these out, join our Felix\nfamily, and enjoy some\nof the leading theatre\nproductions in the world\non a student budget!\nMousetrap is the longest running play at the West End! // Wikimedia\n\n"

    "content": "Fame the Musical\nRouge\nA circus for grown-ups\nW\nho doesn\u2019t\nwant to be\nf a m o u s ?\nFame the\nMusical is all about that\ndesire to be recognised, to\nbe known, to not fade out\nof existence when death\ntakes hold. While based on\na film from the 1980s, that\ndesire is just as relevant\ntoday. \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Live\nForever\u201d is the refrain of\nour protagonists - talented\nteenagers aspiring to a\ncareer in the performing\narts, who while facing\nthe challenges of growing\nup, must also bare their\nsouls in their respective\nprofessions. Musicians,\nactors and dancers alike\ncome together to share\ntheir stories in the new\nWest End adaptation of\nthe beloved film, TV show\nand musical.\nOutside of the famous\neponymous theme song,\nthe songs of the musical\nthemselves are not as well\nknown. After the amusing\nauditions where the\npromising youngsters are\nbarely given five seconds\nto show their worth,\nthe opening song \u201cHard\nWork\u201d sets the tone for\nthe rest of the first act. The\nstarry-eyed students, with\ntheir heads full of dreams,\nare, if you excuse the pun,\ngiven their fifteen minutes\nof fame in songs like \u201cI\nWant to Make Magic\u201d,\n\u201cCan\u2019t Keep it Down\u201d\nand \u201cLet\u2019s Make a Love\nScene\u201d. Stephanie Rojas\nis a particular standout\nas Carmen, leading the\nlunch jam sequence in the\ncelebratory \u201cThere She\nGoes/Fame\u201d. Jamal Kane\nCrawford as Tyrone plays\nthe troubled and angry\nAfrican American teen\nstereotype perfectly, but\nthis is where Fame the\nMusical starts to show its\nage. Other stereotypes in\nthe musical such as the fat\nfunny girl, the class clown\nand the sensitive artist\nare outdated, sometimes\ninsulting and not very\noriginal.\nThe second act is\nthe stronger of the two,\nwhere life and their\nambitions do not always\ngo to plan. Simon\nAnthony as Schlomo is\nexcellent here, as is West\nEnd debut Alexander\nZane as live-trumpeter\nand comic Goody. The\nactors get their chances\nto shine in numbers like\n\u201cIn LA\u201d and \u201cDancing\non the Sidewalk\u201d, which\nalthough not especially\nmemorable, again allow\nfor some strong perfor-mances. Mica Paris steals\nthe show with \u201cThese Are\nMy Children\u201d, describing\nher motivations behind\nthe assumed toughness of\nthis homeroom teacher.\nWhilst the final song of\nthe musical is a moving\none, we as the audience\nare indulged in the encore,\nwhere the whole cast\nbrings the crowd to their\nfeet to join in the eponymous theme. It\u2019s a chance\nto let go, sing, dance and\nhave fun with some of the\nmost talented youngsters\non the West End this\nseason.\nIf you\u2019re looking for an\nenjoyable evening, Fame\nwill leave you dancing the\nnight away. You might not\nremember the minutiae,\nbut you will remember\nhow it makes you feel.\nIt\u2019s a musical of hope, of\ndreams and as succinctly\nput by Billy Porter at the\nEmmy Awards: \u201cof love\u201d.\nIt makes you think of your\nown goals, your own as-pirations, as these young\npeople are similarly trying\nto make their mark on the\nworld \u2013 life does indeed\nimitate art. As a university\nof STEM students, these\nmay not be totally relata-ble to dancing or singing\non Broadway but may just\ngive you the groove in\nyour step to start the day\nright.\nH\nailing from a\nstellar run at\nthe Edinburgh\nFringe Festival\nis \u2018Rouge: A Circus for\nGrown Ups\u2019. And it is a\ntruly spectacular show.\nThe award-winning\nAustralian production is\na celebration of jaw-drop-ping acrobatics, cheeky\nburlesque and charming\ncabaret that was both\nsensual and gorgeous.\nOverflowing with confidence and sass, each\nperformer filled the\ntheatre with their own\nunique charm, and often\nsent the audience into\nfits of laughter and pure\njoy. Alongside the perfect\ninjection of tongue-in-cheek (and occasionally\nnaughty) humour, the 70-minute show passed in a\nblink of an eye and left us\nwanting more.\nWhilst each short act\nseemed disconnected\nfrom each other, overall\nthe acts worked together\nto expose the audiences\nto various facets of\nburlesque and cabaret.\nIncluded were death-defy-ing acrobatics that left the\naudience gasping in shock\nand heaving sighs of relief\nas the performers completed their immaculate\nroutine. There was even\nsome involvement of the\naudience members with\nthe acrobatics \u2013 it kept\nus on our toes! However,\nsome audience participation was uncalled for:\none woman decided to go\nup on stage, attempting\nto touch the performer\nwithout permission.\nShe was rapidly (and\nsmoothly) shuffled off the\nstage by another perform-er, much to our chagrin\nand amusement.\nThings were kept\nlight-hearted with the\nperformer\u2019s cheeky\nwinks, slapstick humour\nand general sassiness.\nOne entire song had a\nperformer enthusiastically\ndancing with a lampshade\non her head, mimicking\nthe lyrics of David\nGuetta\u2019s \u2018Turn Me On\u2019.\nThe performance then\nbuilt on this theme, with\nsubsequent partially-nude\nacts using the lampshade\nto maintain the performers\u2019 privacy. We were\noften left roaring with\nlaughter as the performers took bites of carrot\nstrapped to a performer\u2019s\nunderwear, whilst another\ngot his pants pulled down\n(they were careful not to\nflash us though!).\nWhilst funny, the true\nhighlight of the show\nwas the acrobatics. We\nwitnessed core strength\nthat one can only aspire\nto, with the performers\u2019\nflexibility and musculature being those made\nof dreams. We can only\nlaud the performers\u2019\nability and skill, alongside\ntheir ability to blend\nthese acts in with sexier\nones. Throughout, they\nmaintained a charm and\nstage presence that left us\nsmiling, with their infectious energy and passion\nrolling onto us.\n\u2018Rouge\u2019was a show that\nleft the audience feeling\nthrilled and empowered.\nA truly decadent blend\nof acrobatics, cabaret\nand burlesque, it is easy\nto see how this show is\nthe Weeklies winner Best\nCircus Adelaide Fringe\n2018 and Fringeworld\n2019. It was an endless\ncelebration of all things\npassionate, operatic and\nborderline inappropriate.\nI could not have imagined\na better way to spend an\nevening, for it was a true\nsensation to behold.\nGravity defying feats of acrobatics //Rouge\nA high energy performance//Fame the Musical\nISSUE 1672\nFELIX\n23\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nMarena Gray\nArts Writer\nWhere?

You have probably\nheard about several, if\nnot all these words at\nsome point in your life.\nYou don\u2019t know what\nexactly goes down, but\none thing\u2019s for sure,\nyou hear the money is\ngood. You\u2019re at Imperial\nCollege too, where select\ngroups consider a summer\ninternship at a certain\ninvestment bank, whose\nname suggest an affinity\nof man and gold, to be\nthe embodiment of peak\nperformance.\nSome years from now,\nyou will be looking for\na job and the financial\nservices industry is a\nviable and lucrative\noption for many hungry\nyoung graduates such as\nyourself. \u201cCan I even get\na job in financial services?\nI know nothing about it,\nshouldn\u2019t an economics or\nbusiness student be more\nsuited?\u201d\nBroadly speaking, the\nfinancial services industry\ninvolves a wide array of\nfields such as accounting,\nasset management, investment banking, corporate\nfinance, insurance and the\nactuarial profession. The\nmost popular are asset\nmanagement and investment banking and is the\ncontext of this article.\nThe goal of asset management is as the name\nsuggest, the management\nof assets. You\u2019ve probably\nheard of Mum and Dad\ninvesting the family\u2019s\nsavings for retirement\nand your expensive\nImperial education, asset\nmanagement firms do just\nthat. The main business\ninvolves making investment decisions in return\nare highly transferable\nto other less stressful\nbut equally well paying\nand exciting areas of the\nindustry. For example,\nmany of the skillsets of\nan investment banker, are\nalso applicable in venture\ncapital firms, which\nbusiness involves investing in promising start-ups.\nWorking in such a firm\ncould possibly mean\nworking with, or possibly\nhaving an early stake in\nthe next exciting firm like\nFacebook or Tesla.\nBanks do not hire\nSTEM students\nFalse. Firms usually have\nno specific subject criteria\nwhen hiring graduates.\nThe caveat being,\none\u2019s qualifications must\nbe from a list of \u201ctarget\u201d\nschools.Target schools are\ngenerally the top schools\nwithin each country/\naround the world. A good\nreference would be top\nmembers of the Russell\nGroup universities, which\nare described as having the\n\u201c\u2026very best research, an\noutstanding teaching and\nlearning experience and\nunrivalled links with local\nand national business and\npublic sector\u201d. In theory,\ngraduates of these universities have received a\nbetter quality of education\nand are therefore, \u201cbetter\u201d\nemployees. While there\nis a movement to look\nbeyond superficial qualifications and focus on\nskills and experience,\nthis admittedly elitist\ncriteria will be around for\nsome time. But you\u2019re at\nImperial College London,\nso don\u2019t fret!\nHowever, certain specialised roles may have\npreferences/requirements\nfor a specific subset of\ndegree subjects. For\nexample, quantitative\nroles requiring stronger\nnumeracy skills will\nfavour or even require\nindividuals with a back-sions of the firm to gain\nexposure to the overall\nbusiness. Competition is\nstiff, since some places on\nthe graduate program are\noffered early to high-per-forming individuals from\ntheir summer internship\nprogram. Summer internships range from 9-12\nweeks and are a taster\ninto the life of a full-time\nemployee. Interns are\nworked hard but are also\noften well remunerated,\nnot just with pay, but\nalso valuable skills and\ncontacts.\nYou\u2019d be right to have\ndeduced the importance\na summer internship\nplays in breaking into the\nindustry. The best way\nto land one? Apply to as\nmany as possible and be\na star applicant. Or join\ninsight events.\nInsight events are\nbeing offered increasingly\nby firms to reach out\nto students as early as\npossible.These are offered\nto students the year prior\nto their penultimate year\n(first-years on a three-year\ncourse/second-years on a\nfour-year course). These\nfor a fee and sometimes\na cut of the profits, for\nlarge companies, wealthy\nindividuals, institutions\nlike universities and basically anyone with a large\nsum of money and other\nassets.

Influences\nfrom afrobeat and 60s\nhard-bop balance to create\na colourful collection of\nmid-tempo tunes.\nDelving neither too\nfar into Coltranian solos\nnor content to sit within\nthe confines of a groove,\nthe backing bends\nsubtly to the atmosphere\neach soloist builds. An\nengaging but never arresting or exhausting energy\npulses through each track.\nSaxophonists Cassie\nKinoshi and Nubya\nGarcia lay more spacious,\nrhythmically driven solos\nwhich prove at times\nunderwhelming. Sheila\nMaurice-Grey\u2019s trumpet\nwork is more limber, with\ndense bursts of melody,\nmaking for a more enjoyable listen.\nThe rhythm section,\nwhilst musically competent never particularly\nshines on Blume. Double\nbass hides in the mix,\nswathed in heavy cymbal\nwork on several tracks,\ngrooves err toward\nfunctionality over depth.\nShirley Tetteh\u2019s guitar\nbuilds sparse or rich backdrops too - her solo work is\nalso engaging if undersold\nby stale guitar tone. In an\nage where electronics and\nguitar pedals dominate\nboth mainstream and\njazz worlds, the coarse\nguitar found on tracks like\n\u2018Nascene\u2019 comes off as\nlazy, not vintage.\nUltimately, Blume\nproves itself an inter-esting, often beautiful\nrecord, but lacks any real\nstellar moments. - MG\nwith a little. This is mostly\nthanks to the beautiful\nlyrical and compositional\nstorytelling used working\nin perfect harmony,\nshowing you don\u2019t need\nto say a lot to tell a compelling story.- GR\nSpeaking about the title\nof this new effort, All My\nHeroes Are Cornballs,\nJPEGMAFIA reflects on\nthe common internet age\nrealisation that people\nwe think of as our role\nmodels are humans\ncapable of human-level\ndisappointment. Significantly, he stresses the fact\nthat this goes both ways\n- he feels he is bound to\nbe letting down someone\nsomewhere at any given\npoint in time. This album\nis somewhat of a response\nto that idea, through a\nnow well-established\nPEGGY lens of aggression mixed with nihilism.\nPEGGY is all too aware\nthat the punch-in-the-face, noisey, challenging\nstyle that won him so\nmuch critical acclaim\nafter last year\u2019s Veteran\nis what fans have come\nto expect. He satirically\nacknowledges the irony\nof listenability therefore\nbeing a sign of his music\ncoming short in a series of\npromotional videos where\nhe plays tracks from his\nalbum to contemporaries\nhe respects (including\nJames Blake, Slowthai\nand Jeff Tweedy). Despite\ntheir praise of his work, he\nlabels the videos as proof\nof their disappointment,\nthe only exception being\nDenzel Curry who is said\nto be \u201csatisfied\u201d in the\nvideo title despite trashing\nthe album and calling it\n\u201cYeezus with hobos\u201d.\nTracks \u2018Free the Frail\u2019\nand \u2018Rap Grow Old &\nDie x No Child Left\nBehind\u2019 have the clearest\nfame-reflective themes on\nthe albums. The former\nis an uncharacteristically\nclean moment where\nPEGGY attempts to\ntalk through his strange\nand turbulent emotional\nresponse to actually\n\u201cfeeling employed\u201d. The\ninstrumental includes a\nlow, lazy tide of a bass\nand pecking synth-drum\nclaps which alternate\nwith a more organic\ndrum refrain. The latter\nsees PEGGY rap over a\ndrilling static that contrasts soft keys that come\nin for a chorus where he\nsings about a \u201cvicious\ncycle\u201d where you go from\n\u201cBobby\u201d (presumably\nShmurda - a felon yet a\ncult legend) to \u201cMichael\u201d\n(presumably Jackson - an\nicon with a soiled name).\nThe album\u2019s lyrical\ncontent goes beyond just a\nresponse to fame though.\nPEGGY uses his new\nvantagepointtofurther interrogate archetypes in the\nweird modern cesspool of\nshallow thots and rappers,\nmusic industry soul-suck-ers, brazen bigots and\ninternet-dwelling-pseu-do-liberal closet-racists\nand quasi-incels. Through\nthis all, PEGGY grapples\nwith his own identity -his proximity with all\nthese groups seems to\nmake him paranoid of\nlosing the ability to self\ndefine. In particular, his\nexperiences with the\naforementioned bigots\nand internet-dwellers -two sides to the \u201ccracker\u201d\ncoin - seem to have made\nhim hyper-insecure of\nhis large white fan-base\nwho genuinely admire his\nwork and whose support\nhe is ultimately grateful\nfor. His obsession with\nshooting \u201ccrackers\u201d down\ntherefore seems to be an\novercompensation.\n\u2018Grimy Wifu\u2019, a beautifully composed track that\ntransitions immaculately\nfrom the previous, sees\nPEGGY\u2019s creepy infatuation with confrontation\nmanifest as romantic\nfeelings for his gun. A\nmellow acoustic guitar\nleads the track but a vis-cously vibrating bass that\nlies dormant just beneath\nand repeated glitching\nembellishments give the\nimpression of being in the\ncore of a tornado. \u2018PTSD\u2019\nwhich follows on from this\ncontinues this confrontational theme but this time\nwith the attention focused\non the person PEGGY\u2019s\nbullets are aimed at. The\ninstrumental is beautiful\nonce again but is more\ndepressive, precariously\nheld just above threaten-ing. It also features one of\nthe hardest verses on the\nalbum, with the following\nbrilliant bars: \u201cYour deal\nlook like Brexit/ biting\ncrackers and wonder why\nyou anorexic\u201d.\n\u2018Beta Male Strategies\u2019\nearlier in the tracklist is\none of the most sonically\nimpressive moments of\nthe album, starting with\na gorgeous, hypnotic\nsample that sounds like\nan other-worldly paradise.\nPEGGY ingeniously plays\nwith the mixing so that,\nwhen the deathly beat\nswitch suddenly comes in\nand he begins to rap over\nit, certain bars spring right\nagainst your ear drums\n- \u201cGLOCK WITH THE\nDICK\u201d. The title track,\nwith its deceptively harmonious glitching synth\nwinks that sound stellar\nover a bass that teasingly\ncomes and goes, and the\nopening track, \u2018Jesus\nForgive Me, IAmAThot\u2019,\nwith its dreamy, watery\nsynths neatly spliced with\nchaotic screaming vocal\nscrambles, are similarly\nstunning.\nDespite the experimentation in places falling just\nthe wrong side of abrasive,\nthe ratio of impressive to\nbemusing on this record is\noverall just right. - AR\n// Domino Recording Co.\nArtist: N\u00e9rija.

The beat-up\nsounding instruments\nand Julien Ehrlich\u2019s ev-er-so-softly sung vocals\ngive the sound a warmth\nand authenticity - that\ndewy gooey country\ngoodness. In my eyes\nit captures so perfectly\nthose fragile little\nmoments, where it feels\nby chance you\u2019ve made it\nto the perfect place with\nthe perfect people, the\nsummer memories that\nstick with you for life.\nThe country/indie-rock\nduo has returned after\nthree years with a\nmuch more sedated\nalbum about the pivotal\nmoments in love and life.\nWhether falling back in\nto love or losing an old\nfriend, Whitney\u2019s tender\napproach helps capture\nthese moments between\nmoments.

I thought it would be a\nvery good way to get the ball rolling if you are thinking about a career in finance. Since I applied for a Capital\nMarkets Insight week, and given my quantitative engineering background, I was placed on a Securitisation\nDesk.\nI mainly work shadowed my team but also had talks from members in the DCF, ECF, Leveraged Finance and\nEquity Linked teams. On the final day was a series of interviews for the summer 2020 internship. It was clear that\nCiti was extremely diverse, people had a range of backgrounds from History to Astrophysics. Furthermore, whilst\nthey were extremely driven, they were also very humble and approachable even during my interviews.\nPersonally, I thought it was an amazing opportunity. The financial services industry is so ranging and vast that\nbefore my Insight week, I was almost intimidated and overwhelmed. However, having completed it, I\u2019m now much\nmore informed and know what I want to do and how I\u2019m going to achieve it.\nI would say that you have nothing to lose in giving it a shot. All firms are clear that they expect you not to be 100%\nsure about a career with them. In fact if you are, you can come across narrow minded in an interview.\nTom Alston,\nMEng Aeronautical Engineering\nSpring Week at Citi Bank\nVanessa Tang\nMEng Chemical Engineering\nSpring Week at Deutsche Bank and PJT Partners\nRohhil Chhabra\nMEng Mechanical Engineering\nSpring Week at Citi Bank\nI\nheard of spring insight weeks before entering Imperial. I joined the Investment Society, which conducted C.V.\nworkshops and assigned me a mentor, from whom I received guidance throughout the application process. My\ninterest in the financial services motivated me to apply to gain exposure to the day-to-day work in the industry\nBeing in the Banking and Custody Team in the Private Banking division, I worked with various directors on client\nprofiling and performed an analysis on different regions of the bank\u2019s business. My managing director was patient\nwith his explanations and in answering my queries. I enjoyed the flexibility to shadow other teams, it granted me\ninsights into teams like Markets and Investment Management. The amount of employee contact, from junior analyst\nto global heads helped in building a network within the company. I was impressed by the complexity of the division\nand the number of teams that go behind the entire vehicle. I also learnt of the huge potential of private banking as\nglobal wealth is growing exponentially.\nI was surprised with the amount learnt over just 5 days and how approachable senior employees are. This is the\nadvantage of being an intern, most people are willing to help. I made strong connections with some employees\nthat I am still in touch with and who mentor me on this journey to break into the industry. Being fast tracked to an\nAssessment Centre for a summer analyst position the following year was a benefit as summer internships are very\ncompetitive. The professional work environment also exposed my strengths and weakness, giving me fresh insights\ninto my work ethic. Apprehensive juniors should apply as STEM students are highly sought after for their analytical\nand problem-solving skills. They are a fresh template for firms to train and mould. Spring weeks are an opportunity\nto discover how well you fit into the industry and firm, making you aware of your motivations and interests.\nAre Insight Events important for a career in finance?\nHear all about it from your fellow students\nI\nfound out about insight events through attending company networking sessions and through word of mouth.\nI believe in having \u201chands-on\u201d experience rather than learning about a company through a two-hour presentation \u2013 therefore insight events that run for one week allows me to better understand the day-to-day\ntasks and the company culture. In addition, most insight events fast track attendees for summer internships\n\u2013 it is always better to secure an internship a year in advance to reduce the stress of applying. After attending\ntwo spring weeks, one at a bulge bracket bank and another at a boutique financial advisory firm, I realised:\n1. Financial skills do not matter. You just need to be smart, be able to read the room, and be commercially aware.\n2. Firms receive a very high volume of spring/insight week applications, sometimes your offer is based on \u201cluck\u201d.\n3. Firms are really good at marketing themselves and their roles. Be aware of the firms\u2019 sugar-coating.\n4. What you do as an analyst does not differ much from bank to bank. Getting to know the people and the culture\nis more important.\nFor those who are apprehensive about applying:\n1. Apply early.\n2. Go through the whole process. You will see for yourself whether you like it or not. Financial services is not for\neveryone. Feel free to reach out to me on Linkedin or via email (vanessa.tang17@imperial.ac.uk) if you have any\nquestions, always happy to have a chat.\n\n"

This\npositive news coincided\nprecisely with confusion\nfrom Sabbatical officers\nwho arrived in the Union\noffices on Monday to find\nthem deserted. A solitary\npost-it note had been left\nat reception explaining\nthat all the staff had\nhanded in their notice a\nmonth ago and forgotten\nto mention it to the Sabbs.\nThe silence of the office\nwas punctuated only by\nthe incessant ringing of\nthe phones from students\nrequesting room book-ings.\nUnion President\nBluejay Mood explained\nthat high staff turnover is\nstandard fare in student\nunions and that whilst\nthe present situation was\nsomewhat atypical, (he\nwas at this point speaking\ninto two telephones and\ntyping at the same time)\nthere was really nothing\nto be worried about. He\nwent on to say that the\nresignations provided an\nopportunity for a \u2018fresh\nstart\u2019attheoften-maligned\ninstitution.\nOne former employee\ncontacted Felix to explain\ntheir reasons for leaving\ntheir post, stating that\nthey wanted to work for\na more competent and\nstable organization and so\nhad taken a job working\nfor the UK Government.\nAnother claimed that\nthey never meant to start\nworking for the Union,\nthey had been looking for\nthe BBC Proms talks a\ncouple of years back and\ngot lost.After accidentally\nstumbling into the offices\nthey took pity on the\nstruggling organization\nand had been doing the\njob of Managing Director\non an ad hoc basis.\nWhilst some are\nconcerned by the possible effect on student\nexperience, Shane Weary\n(Vice Provost \u2013 Bevs)\npainted an altogether more\npositive picture of recent\nevents: \u201cStudents may\nexperience slightly slower\nresponses to their queries\nbut we believe that most\nmembers won\u2019t observe\nmuch difference in response times to usual\u201d.\nHe went on to explain that\nthe significant savings on\nstaff wages would now be\nplowed back into new improvements to the student\nexperience, such as food\nat H-Bar and breakfasts\nin the SCR. Lastly, Weary\nstated that whilst the\nCollege was sad to see so\nmany of their colleagues\nacross the road leave, the\nglut of leaving parties had\nreally turned around the\ncommercial outlets drink\nsales for the quarter and\nthat they were looking\ninto the possibility of\nmaking these leaving dos\na regular event.\nNew storage space? // Pixabay\nUnion saved from financial woes as all staff quit\nThis week you finally\nmotivate yourself to\nget up and start the day\nearly... to watch the\nRugby World Cup.\nThis week you\u2019re an\nacademic annoyed that all\nof your slaves have had\nto return to their normal\ndegrees.

Once we\u2019ve done\nthat, then we can think\nabout other things that\nwe can do \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t\neven want to contemplate\nincreasing student until\nwe\u2019ve got our act together\nas far as the student experience is concerned.\u201d\nBlackett and physics\nare not the only ones at\nImperial to have struggled\nwith space and facilities.\nThere have been multiple\napproaches to the problem\nacross different departments in recent years. The\ncollege decided to sell St.\nMary\u2019s, to the outcry of\nmany medical students,\nand build improved\nspaces at other campuses\nsuch as Charing Cross\nto compensate. Several\ndepartments decided to\nmove a portion of their\nfacilities and faculty to\nthe White City campus \u2013\nand Michele revealed that\nwhen she took up office,\nshe was also asked to\nconsider a similar move\nfor physics.\n\u201cWhen I first became\nHead of Department, I\nwas asked to look into\nhow many staff might in\nthe future move over to\nWhite City \u2013 and which\nspecific parts of the department might have that\ndesire. And then I became\naware that there wasn\u2019t a\ncollege fund to finance the\nmove. The conversation\nevolved into discussing\nour needs and wants in\nterms of space overall\nand what\u2019s good for the\ndepartment long-term.\u201d\nAsked about the presence physics might one\nday have in White City,\nshe said \u201corganically, it\nwould be good to have a\nfootprint over there \u2013 a\nlot of our staff work with\nthe chemists anyway. The\nthing that worries me is\nundergraduate students\nremaining in South Kensington while staff move,\nwhich may have an effect\non the connection between\nstaff and students. This is\nsomething that I know\nChemistry is working\nvery hard at. White City\nis a fantastic space; we\nshould be thinking about\nhow we utilise it, but it\nwill cost a lot of money to\nmove there. There needs\nto be a plan around how\nthat would be carried out.\u201d\nThe approach in\nphysics is, therefore, to\ninvest heavily into fully\noptimising the space\navailable before giving\nup on the historic Blackett\nbuilding \u2013 at least for now.\nIn her words: \u201cuntil we\nturn things around in the\nshort-term, nothing is ever\ngoing to happen in the\nlong-term \u2026 making the\nspace we have better for\nstudents \u2013 that\u2019s a starting\npoint.\u201d\nThis is an approach\nwhich will likely be\npopular with students\n\u2013 giving them a clear\nbenefit with little potential drawback \u2013 but the\nconcern is what the long-term solutions might end\nup being should the trend\nof expansion across the\ncollege continue. There\nis a cap on how effective\noptimisation can be; in\nthe end, physical limitations in the space will\nmean that nothing more\ncan practically be done.\nOne option that\u2019s being\nexplored is building a new\nstudent-focused space via\ndonations \u2013 the issue there\nthen being that real estate\nnear Blackett is very\nexpensive, or completely\nunavailable.\nOne core difference\nwith the physics department\u2019s approach is the\nabundance of student\nconsultation during these\nprojects \u2013 a sign that a\ngenuine commitment to\ninvolving and integrating\nstudents into the department is present. The college\u2019s decision to sell St.\nMary\u2019s, by contrast, was\nmade with very little \u2013 or,\ndepending on who you\nask, none at all.\nAs these refurbishment\nprojects have been undertaken over the last several\nyears, physics\u2019 National\nStudent Survey scores\nhave been plummeting.\nDespite a small rise in\nmany satisfaction categories in the 2019 survey,\nevery category from satisfaction with teaching to\nfeedback to management\nhave fallen over 10%, and\nin some cases much more,\nsince 2015. The hope\nremains that changes such\nas refurbishments and\ncurriculum reviews will\ncontinue to improve the\nstudent experience \u2013 but\nMichele clarified that the\nThe new 'active learning' lecture theatre is very exciting, but massively imrpoved functionality but came with a cost // Portsdown\n\u201cUntil we turn\nthings around\nin the short-term, nothing\nis ever going\nto happen in\nthe long term.\npriority is not the score\nitself, but to holistically\nand genuinely improve\nstudent wellbeing.\n\u201cWhen I saw the NSS\ncomments last summer, I\nwas devastated \u2026 they\u2019re\nreally saddening. And\nwe\u2019re beginning to turn\nthings around a little. But\nI had warned everyone in\nthe department \u2013 I said\nwe\u2019re not doing this to\nturn around NSS scores.\nIt doesn\u2019t take a year, it\ntakes four, five, ten years\nto turn them around \u2013 if\nthat's what we\u2019re aiming\nat. For me, I just did not\nwant students leaving\nhere thinking \u2018I haven\u2019t\nenjoyed my time here\u2019.\nIt\u2019s not an easy degree \u2013 I\ndon't want to change that\n\u2013 but I want it to be an\ninteractive degree. I want\nstudents to feel part of the\ndepartment \u2013 we are not\na department without the\nstudents.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I\nfirst became\nHead of\nDepartment,\nI was asked to\nlook into how\nmany staff\nmight move\nover to White\nCity.\u201d\n\n"

But not many\npeople \u2013 even IC\u2019s own\nstudents \u2013 know about\nthe four vintage vehicles\nliving in Imperial\u2019s own\nSouth Kensington campus\namidst all the hustle and\nbustle.\nWay back in the 20th\ncentury, the City and\nGuilds Union, Royal\nCollege of Science Union,\nand Royal School of\nMines Union all decided\nto acquire vehicles of\nsome description at\nvarious points throughout\nthe century \u2013 starting with\nthe Guilds\u2019 purchase of a\n1908 Rover (Boanerges I)\nin 1920.\nBo\u2019 I, as he was affectionately known, served as\na faithful (if loud) mascot\nuntil 1924, at which point\nhe was no longer permitted to participate in the\nannual Veteran Car Club\u2019s\nLondon to Brighton run\non account of his youth-fulness. In came Bo\u2019 II,\na little 1902 James and\nBrowne town car \u2013 the\nonly known surviving\nvehicle of the type \u2013 that\nmore than lives up to its\nnamesake of the biblical\n\u2018Sons of Thunder\u2019 (when\nhe\u2019s not \u2018Boken\u2019, as\nstudents affectionately if\nexasperatedly say when he\ndecides to yet again chuck\nout a bit of his engine).\nOnce again qualified for\nthe VCC\u2019s Brighton runs,\nstudents have since diligently kept Bo\u2019 in various\nstates of good repair year\nafter year.\nThen comes 1955.\nAs reported by Felix at\nthe time, \u201cMines was\nwaking up to the fact it\nhadn\u2019t a mascot\u201d. So, in\ntrue inter-departmental\ncompetitive spirit, the\nRSMU acquired a 1919\nAveling and Porter steam\ntraction engine and named\nher Clementine after the\nminer\u2019s daughter in the\nsong \u2018Oh, My Darling\nClementine\u2019. Unfortunately, after only a scant\nfive years, Clementine I\nfollowed the fate of the\nsong\u2019s eponymous star\nandwaslosttothestudents\nwhen it was decided that\na steam engine with its\nmultitude of health and\nsafety requirements was\ntoo much for the Union\nto handle. The students\nturned their attention to\nother suitable vehicles to\ntake Clem I\u2019s place, and\neventually decided that\na 1926 Morris T-type\none-ton truck that had\npreviously served on\na brewery estate was a\nsuitable replacement \u2013 her\nbeer holding capability\nsurely had no influence on\nthe decision whatsoever.\nClem II has since enjoyed\nlife as the RSM mascot,\nand despite a couple of\ncomplete overhauls over\nthe years by students who\nhad to pick up the pieces\n(sometimes literally) left\nbehind by their predeces-sors, she is now back on\nthe road trundling across\nthe UK to various vintage\nvehicle rallies, steam\nshows, and a great number\nof pubs and chippys!\nNot wanting to feel left\nout, the RCSU\u2019s scientists\ndecided they needed a\nsuitably flashy vehicle\nof their own to transport\ntheir president around \u2013 a\n1916 Dennis N-type fire\nengine was perfect, and\nit just so happened that a\nsoap factory had one for\nsale. After being offered\n\u00a350 for said fire engine,\nthe factory was kind\nenough to donate her to\nthe students for educa-tion, and so the newly\nchristened Jezebel came\nto Imperial \u2013 no thanks\nto the multiple bearing\nfailures that already\noccurred en route to\ncampus for the first time.\nSince then, generations\nof dedicated students\nhave kept her 55 square\nfeet of brass polished to a\nshine, and proudly show\nher off whenever the opportunity arises. She has\neven starred in films and\nshows such as Blue Peter,\nThe Jokers, and Downton\nAbbey (in the first episode\nof season five), and has\neven had an encounter\nwith the Queen Mother!\nOne would think that\nthree vehicles for three\nconstituent unions would\nhave been enough, but\nin 1980 the Guildsmen\nwere gifted a 1926 Nera-Car motorcycle by an\naeronautics professor, and\nBo\u2019 suddenly had a little\nbrother. It was generally\nagreed that whatever\nname the \u2018nearly a car\u2019\nmotorbike was to be\ncalled had to compliment\n\u201cBo\u2019\u201d, and eventually it\ncame down to two options\n- \u2018LLOCKS\u2019 or \u2018Derrick\u2019,\nafter the Hollywood\nstar Bo Derek. Rather\nsensibly, \u201cDerrick\u201d had\nthe winning vote.\nNowadays, the vehicles\nare kept in their garages\non the South Kensington\ncampus, and are lovingly\ncared for by volunteer\nstudents and alumni from\nacross all departments.\nEvery Wednesday, in a\ncorner of the campus,\nyou might come across\none of the vehicles and a\ngrease-covered monkey\n\u2013 or, rather, a student \u2013 un-derneath, tinkering away.\nYou might hear some\nless than proper language\nwhen the vehicles, old\nand cantankerous as they\nare, inevitably throw a fit\nand decide to not coop-erate. You might look up\nfrom your studies in the\nlibrary at the sound of\nJez\u2019s bell, Clem\u2019s horn,\nor Bo\u2019s engine, and see\nthe vehicles head out for\nan event or \u2018test drives\u2019,\nto the sound of cheering\nfrom random bystanders.\nYou might even get a ride\non the vehicles yourself at\nthe various College and\nUnion events the vehicles\npop up at annually, such\nas the upcoming Welcome\nWeek.\nNow that we\u2019ve made\nthe medics wish for their\nown motorised mascot, I\nwish you all a wonderful\nyear ahead, and ask that\nyou keep an eye and\near out for Jez, Clem,\nBo\u2019, and Derrick!

Despite his proficiency with the character\nand presence in the com-munity, ESAM has never\nwon a major tournament;\nhe frequently made top\n8s and other respectable\npositions but could never\nattain true success. Not\nonly was ESAM unable\nto achieve sweet victory,\n\u201cESAM\u2019s legacy\ntruly comes\nfrom his top-level Pikachu\nperformance\u201d\nbut neither was Pikachu\n\u2013 leading to most players\ndismissing his placement\nof the character in top tier.\nOn September 15th,\n2019, that all changed.\nwith so much experience\nand yet so little glory associated with his name, like\na true underdog, ESAM\nand his Pikachu destroyed\nGlitch 7 Singles - the most\nrecent major tournament\n- achieving 1st place for\nthe first time in his entire\ncareer. ESAM sported\nan impressive record\nthroughout the entire tour-nament, winning every\nset he played: including\nagainst top players such\nas the likes of Tweek and\nNairo. Finishing off, he\nwas faced up against the\nFox player Light, whom\nhe had beaten 3-1 earlier\nin Winner\u2019s Finals.

    "content": "TECH\nFELIX ISSUE 1727\ntecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n37\nthese cameras stack\nagainst each other, it\u2019s\nessential to understand\nthe basics of how cameras\nproduce images.\nThe aperture, ISO,\nand shutter speed, often\ndubbed as the fundamental\nbuildings of photography,\ndecide how the image is\nproduced. The aperture\nacts as the \u201cpupil\u201d of the\ncamera as it controls the\namount of light entering\nthe sensor. The ISO\ndecides how sensitive the\ncamera is to light; i.e., how\nbright the photo would be.\nFinally, the shutter speed\nrepresents the amount of\ntime for which the camera\nshutter remains open; in\neffect, it\u2019s the amount of\ntime that a camera takes\nto capture a photo.\nSmartphones often\nhave fixed apertures, thus\nlimiting their low light ca-pability. They overcome\nthisbyloweringtheshutter\nspeed, effectively increasing the amount of light\ninto the sensor. However,\nthis poses a problem\nas lowering the shutter\nspeed causes motion blur.\nHence, these cameras\nhave in-built optical\nimage stabilization.\nAlthough this solution\nmakes up for small\nhand movements, larger\ncamera shakes, coupled\nwith the movement of the\nsubject(s), would effectively ruin the resulting\nphotograph. To resolve\nthis, smartphones turn to\npost-processing through\nsoftware tricks, such as\n\u201cnight sight\u201d in Google\u2019s\nPixel and \u201cnight mode\u201d\nin Apple\u2019s iPhone 11. Alternatively, this could be\nfixed through external stabilization methods, such\nas gimbals and tripods,\nas used by pro-cameras.\nHowever, smartphone\nmanufacturers target\nease-of-use and minimal\ndependence on external\nassistance modules.\nAnother way smartphones tackle lighting\nconditions is through\nmachine learning. The\ncamera captures images\none after another at\nmultiple exposure levels\nand intelligently merges\nselect photos to create a\nwell-balanced picture.\nSimilar software-based\nmethods are also used\nto \u201cstitch\u201d images from\nmultiple cameras to form\na singular image, such\nas those found in the\nNokia 9, a smartphone\nwith a 5-camera system.\nThis phone was made\nin collaboration with\nLight, the company that\nmade L16, a compact and\neasily portable device\nthat houses 16 cameras.\nTogether, these cameras\nimages is felt best through\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel 3. Despite\nonly possessing a single\nrear camera, this phone\nhas been consistently\nranked as having one of\nthe best modern smartphone camera systems.\nOn the flip side, DSLRs\nand mirrorless cameras\nhave greater flexibility\nin manual control and\npossess a vast array of\nlens choices. Their raw\ncapability to capture\nphotos in almost any\nlighting environment outweighs the software tricks\nused by smartphones.\nHowever, the convenience and affordability\nof smartphones cameras\nremain unmatched.\nLens Choices in\nSmartphones\nThe multiple camera\nsystem isn\u2019t just used for\nzoom purposes. Many\npopular camera systems\ntoday use a third wide-an-gle camera to capture a\nwider scene. Other camera\noptions include monochrome and time-of-flight\ncameras. A monochrome\ncamera is used to boost\nthe image quality through\nsoftware manipulation as\nit captures the highlights\nand shadows while a time-of-flight camera captures\ndepth information and is\nessential for immersive\naugmented reality experi-ences.\nUniqueness in\nCamera Systems\nAs smartphone manufacturers increase the\ncamera count on their\ncamera systems, the\nfactor of uniqueness in\ntheir products decrease.\nTo make up for this,\nthey resort to additional\nfeatures that serve as\nmethods to lure customers to their brand. For\nexample, increasing the\nmegapixel count of the\ncameras, introducing\ndifferent lighting modes,\nusing machine learning\nto adapt the camera to the\nscene, and providing the\nend-user with control over\nthe post-processing of the\nimage.\nAgain, this \u201chealthy\ncompetition\u201d has driven\nan immense improvement\nin the production of\nhigh-quality innovative\ncamera modules. A recent\nexample is the introduction of folded optics\ncamera systems, which\nallow for optical zoom in\nthe range of 5x to 10x.\nAn aspect that manufacturers heavily focus on\nis the shape of the camera\nsystem. With the number\nof cameras increasing\nyear after year and phones\nlooking more alike than\never, the arrangement\nof cameras has slowly\nstarted to serve as brand\nidentifiers.\nConclusion\nAs a result, the smart-phoneisstartingtobecome\nincreasingly centered\naround its camera system.\nWhat started as an added\nselling point has now\nsparked a race for mobile\nvendors to compete in and\nfight to lead the n-camera\nsmartphone trend.\n\u201cThe incredible\neffectiveness\nof software\nmanipulation\nin processing\nimages is felt\nbest through\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel\n3.\u201d\nuse stitching algorithms to\nproduceimagesthatnearly\nmatch those produced by\npro-level cameras.\nThe incredible effectiveness of software manipulation in processing\n37 37\n\n"

In this, the first edition of the new academic year, our\nmusic editors take you through it all - from Lizzo, Men I Trust and BROCKHAMPTON to King Gizz and JPEGMAFIA.\nMUSIC\nAsad Raja\nMusic Editor\nMiles Gulliford\nMusic Editor\nMartin Flerin\nMusic Editor\nGuthrie Ruby\nMusic Editor\nEmily Freeman\nMusic Editor\nDespite being the first\nalbum in four years for\nthe nuck trio, there had\nbeen a steady sprinkling\nof singles coming out\nthroughout that time to\nfeed the hungry ears of\nfans. That means that 8 of\nthe 24 tracks on the long\nawaited Oncle Jazz were\nalready known to fans of\nband Men I Trust.\nBeing a band of this\nsize, (they sold out their\nshow at Village Underground last year quickly\nenough for me not to get\ntickets) while also telling\nrecord labels to get fucked,\nis quite an achievement.\nThat is why their plan of\nslowly releasing singles\nover a period of intense\ntouring (upside is they\u2019re\nin London every year), in\norder to grow their follow-ing, worked so brilliantly.\nIt also allowed their\nsound to mature, as they\nretreated to the Quebec\ncountryside, mixing, re-cording, fine-tuning until\ntheir sound peaked in an\nalbum that flows from\nstart to finish so smoothly\nit\u2019s hard to not slide all\nthe way down, even if\nyou just dipped your toe\nin for a tune. So smooth.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be alright // Stay\nhere some time // This\ncountry dog // Won\u2019t die\nin the city\u201d, a chorus that\u2019s\nbeen spinning around my\nhead ever since \u2018Tailwhip\u2019\ncame out as a single, sums\nit up nicely: the album is a\nbreath of fresh air.\nTheir lyrics are so\nquietly poignant, a virtue\nwhich is rare in the era of\nscreamtertainment, and\nmake the perfect filling for\nthe blanket of melancholy\nwhich constitutes many of\ntheir melodies. But even\nthe lyricless nuggets in\nthe album - \u2018Slap Pie\u2019,\n\u2018Fiero GT\u2019, and especially\n\u2018Poodle of Mud\u2019 - do a\nlot to round out the sound\nof the album. Oh, and\n\u2018Numb\u2019sounds like a Mild\nHigh Club song - always a\nplus. Where\u2019s YOUR new\nalbum BOIS!? - MF\n\u201c...quietly\npoignant, a\nvirtue which\nis rare in the\nera of screamtertainment...\u201d\nReleased in April this\nyear, Cuz I Love You\u2019s\nriveting energy took its\ntime to creep into public\nconsciousness, but with\na little help from meme\nculture (\u201cI just took a\nDNA test, turns out I\u2019m\n100% that bitch\u201d) Lizzo\u2019s\nmajor label debut charted\nhighly this summer.\nBlending RnB and\nHip-hop influences\nwith an impeccable\npop sensibility, Lizzo\nproves herself a high par\nsongwriter throughout;\nfrom the bombast of the\ntitle track, to bangers\nlike \u2018Heaven help me\u2019\nand \u2018Like a girl\u2019. Instrumentals blend trap-style\ndrums and synths with\nlive instruments, creating\na listenable backdrop\nfor the Minnesotan\u2019s enthralling deliveries.\nLizzo\u2019s voice croons,\ngroans, belts and teases\nto measure on each track,\nallowing her to inject her\nuplifting and often witty\n(if simple) lyrics with a\nlife of their own. Without\nthis life, the themes of\nself-love, equality and\nheartbreak that are Cuz I\nLove You could feel flimsy\nand inauthentic, but here\nthey are entirely heartfelt.\nDespite some weaker\ntracks towards its rear end\n(\u2018Exactly how I feel\u2019 and\n\u2018Better in Colour\u2019come to\nmind), Cuz I Love You is a\ndelight on the ears; a must\nlisten for 2019. - MG\nThey\u2019re back, and\nready to bear all in their\nmost depressed release\nyet.\nGINGER is for many a\ndesiredlookintotheminds\nof the world\u2019s biggest\nboyband following a\nseries of major disturbances to the group. After\nthe not very \u201csonically\nconsistent\u201d iridescence\nit seems that the group\nhas regained some of its\ncreative cohesion. The\nband work through and\ndiscuss much of what has\nbeen troubling them over\nthe past year, the most\nanticipated of which was\nthe decision to remove\nAmeer Vann (covered\non the track \u2018DEARLY\nDEPARTED\u2019).\nIt seems as though the\nband is finally finding\nsolid footing after losing\nsuch an integral member.\nIn places the chemistry\nis not quite what it was\nin the Saturation days,\nbut it appears we may\nbe headed towards\nsomething different and\nexciting. The production\nis still fresh, keeping even\nthe most avid of listeners\non their toes speculating\nwhat may come next.\nCombined with a maturation of the distinctive\nvocal/rap styles within\nthe group, this album has\nhelped remind us that\nBROCKHAMPTON are\nstronger than ever and\nready to keep making\nfantastic music. - GR\nTool\u2019s fifth album, Fear\nInoculum, has blessed our\nears after 13 long years\nof waiting. In true Tool\nfashion, the 10-track, 87-minute long prog-metal\nextravaganza begs to\nengulf you, smothering\nyou with 10-minute\nprogressive masterpieces\nthat help you to ascend to\nthe astral plane. However,\nfor an album that\u2019s been\nstewing for over a decade,\nit\u2019s not everything you\nmay expect.\nFrontman Maynard\nJames Keenan vocals\nspend a large proportion\nof the album on the back-burner, with the interplay\nbetween the instruments\ntaking centre stage; this\nis much like how Tool\nprefer to perform on stage\nnowadays, with Keenan\nhiding in the shadows\nto let the music take\nprecedent. This results\nin a truly mature sound,\nwhich is overtly intricate,\ndemanding the need for\nrepeat listens to capture\nall the details.\nThis isn\u2019t unlike Tool\nthough, and there are definitely notable tracks from\nthe band on this album:\n\u2018Descending\u2019, \u20187empest\u2019\nand the album\u2019s eponymous track are all sure to\nstand the test of time as\nsome of Tool\u2019s best.\nIn short, Tool have\ngifted their fans with a\nnew album, and if you\u2019re\na Tool fan, it does not\ndisappoint. Although if\nyou\u2019re new to the Toolgame, personally I\u2019d start\nsomewhere else. - EF\n// Atlantic\nArtist: Lizzo.\nLabel: Atlantic.

In the US, the\ngovernment has essentially ignored protesters\nand continued with its\npolicies of reopening\ncoal mines and extracting more oil. When so\nmany people make their\nviews so clear, politicians that ignore them\nshould do so at their\nown peril, but it really\nseems that they aren\u2019t\nthat bothered by the risk.\nDespite the protesters\u2019\nsimple message \u2013 let\u2019s\ncut our emissions and\nsave the planet \u2013 the\nsolution is not so simple.\nGovernments across\nthe globe are asking:\nwhat do we actually\nneed to do? Is it right\nin a liberal society to\ndemand people use less\nenergy? Is it practical\nto abolish single use\nAfter strong words at the UN Climate Change Summit and large protests across the globe, when will politicians\nget serious about tackling climate change?\nYouth climate strike // KAIROS Canada\nISSUE 1727\nFELIX\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cWhen so\nmany people\nmake their\nviews so clear,\npoliticians that\nignore them\nshould do so\nat their own\nperil\u201d\nplastic? Where can we\nbuild windfarms so that\npeople won\u2019t kick up\na fuss? The sheer complexity of all the considerations to be made\nis astonishing. Furthermore, the President of\nthe US refuses to believe\nin climate change, and\nother big economies\nsuch as China and India\nare reluctant to pursue\neco-friendly policies at\nthe expense of economic\ngrowth. Therefore, it\nis not surprising that\nsmaller nations, such as\nBritain, which contributes only 1.2% of global\nemissions, don\u2019t see\nany point in meaningful\naction when rhetoric\nhas seemed to be just\nas effective at pleasing\npeople until now.\nHowever, rhetoric\nis no longer working,\nand people want action.\nPrevious attempts at a\nglobal response, through\nthe Paris Accord, have\nbeen unsuccessful and\nthis is leading to frustration with voters. At the\nUN general assembly,\nGreta Thunberg, the\nSwedish activist, said to\npoliticians \u201cyou are not\ndoing enough\u201d and that\nif they \u201creally understood\nthe situation and continued failing to act then\nyou would be evil.\u201d Yet\na sudden shift to a carbon\nneutral economy by 2025,\nas demanded by Extinction Rebellion, would\nhave a massive impact on\neveryone\u2019s way of living.\nFor example, taxes on\nemissions could lead to\nhigher energy prices and\nrestrictions on pollution\nwould mean we must\ntake less foreign holidays.\nNot everyone is prepared\nfor that. There could be\njob losses too. If the oil\nand gas industry, which\nsupports 375000 jobs in\nthe UK, was to collapse,\nthere would be a huge rise\nin unemployment, and\nthis would lead to great\ndissatisfaction with politicians who support climate\nchange action. It would\nbe tragic for positive\nclimate action to become\na source of controversy\nand contempt, and equally\ntragic for future generations to suffer from rising\ntemperatures and sea\nlevels because we failed\nto act.\nIt could be argued that\nin the UK some meaningful action has already\nbeen taken. Investment in\nrenewable energy means\nthat now a minority of\nour energy comes from\nburning coal, oil, and gas.\nThe government also has\na 25 year sustainability\nplan to reduce emissions.\nThe government argues\nthat these small steps will\nbe successful in the long\nrun, but experts argue\nmore action is required.\nPoliticians have the\nunenviable job of balancing public opinion with\nnecessary action, yet,\nwith a recent UN report\nsuggesting emission cut\ntargets must be tripled to\nlimit global heating to 2C\nby 2100, these protests\nhighlight that now is the\ntime to take big, globally\ncoordinated steps to\ncurb our emissions and\nsave the planet. Across\nEurope, climate change is\nrocketing up the political\nagenda; in Germany some\npolls put the Green Party\nahead of Merkel\u2019s CDU,\nso whilst politicians have\nuntil now been reluctant\nto make bold statements,\nwith the future of the\nplanet (and their political\ncareers) at stake, now\nis surely the time to get\nserious about tackling\nclimate change.\n\u201cIt would\nbe tragic for\nclimate action\nto become\na source of\ncontroversy\nand contempt\u201d\n\n"

I knew what\nthe lecture theatres and tutorial spaces are like, but I\nthink unless a member of\nstaff had gone into it, they\nprobably wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen aware.\u201d\nWhen asked whether\nthis lack of awareness\non behalf of staff of the\npoor quality of student\nspaces, and whether the\nsegregation of student-and staff-occupied spaces\ncontributes, she clarified:\n\u201cCommunication is\nalways the key, and that\u2019s\none of the things I\u2019ve tried\nto do since becoming\nHead of Department.\nI would much rather\neveryone was aware of\nthe difficult decisions that\nneed to be made, and that\nchoices have to be made\n\u2013 and that\u2019s not always\nan easy choice to make.\nWhat I want to try and\nmake sure we do as a department is we talk about\nit as a department, so\nnobody can pretend that\nwe don\u2019t know that space\nneeds work.\u201d One of the\nfirst things Michele did in\nher new role was opening\nup the staff common room\nto final-year students to\nfoster connectivity.\nIn regards to the apparent lack of action on\nnecessary refurbishments,\nLuke identified a key\nproblem: necessary renovations are not always\neasy to see. For example,\nthe building has a legal requirement to update all of\nits electrical wiring within\nthe next two years \u2013 a\ngargantuan and expensive\ntask, but one that has no\nperceivable benefit to staff\nand students. Additionally, the time during which\nwork can be completed\nwithout seriously disturbing teaching is limited to\nsummer break \u2013 and often\nonly one or two projects\ncan be undertaken simultaneously without making\nthe building feel unusable.\nDespite these setbacks,\nadditional revitalisations\nto Blackett are being\nplanned \u2013 with student\nconsultation at the\nforefront, once again in\ncollaboration with Luke\nand others throughout the\ndepartment. The StudentShapers programme, on\nthis project led by Hunain\nNadeem, has also identified multiple potential\nstudy spaces, as well as\nexisting spaces, that also\nneed a redesign \u2013 such as\nthe infamous \u2018Dungeon\u2019\non level one of the build-ing.\nHowever, he was\nalso keen to note that\nwhile this is a positive\ndevelopment, and one\nthat will be welcomed\nby students, it should not\nbe viewed as a \u2018fix\u2019 for\nvarious problems with\nBlackett. Physics is home\nto around 900 undergrad-uates, all of whom share a\nnew computer suite with\n120 computers, a small\ncommon room with just\na couple of microwaves,\nand study spaces scattered\nhaphazardly throughout\nthe lower floors of the\nbuilding. The only floor\ndedicated fully to student\nspace is Level 3, out of\n12. The facilities and\nspace dedicated to students is, he argues, simply\nnot sufficient for one of\nthe largest departments\nin the college. Queries\nabout plans to refurbish\nthe common room were\nmet with the immediate\nresponse that the physical\nspace itself is constrained\n\u2013 the most that can be\ndone is replacing furniture\nin order to more effectively utilise the space.\nEven these types of\npositive revitalisations\ncan come with threats to\nwhat little is available; acquiring funds and support\nfor improving deeply unsatisfactory areas comes\nwith conditions that\ncould partially counteract\nthe effectiveness of the\nimprovement. The new\nactive learning centre is\none example.\nIt is a fantastic facility,\nfeaturing high-definition\nscreens, touchscreen\nfunctionality, multiple\nprojectors, surround\nsound systems, individual\naeroplane-style overhead\nlighting, well-spaced\ndesks so that lecturers\ncan reach every student\nduring \u201cclasswork\u201d\nsessions, plugs and data\nconnections at every\ndesk, and more. It is also\nallowing the department\nto revamp their tutorial\nsessions for the incoming\nyear of freshers, switching\nfrom 20-student groups to\na mixture of 60-person\ngroups in the active learning space and smaller\n5-person tutorials similar\nto what later-year students\ncurrently receive.\nHowever, securing this\nfor Blackett meant allowing the space to be booked\nby any department in the\ncollege to use, further\nimpacting on the amount\nof space available for\nphysics students at any\none time \u2013 although\nphysics gets priority on\nblock-booking, and assurances have been offered\nthat the impact on their\nstudents was carefully\nconsidered and minimised\nbefore the proposal was\naccepted.\nIt\u2019s notable that physics\nis one of the few departments at Imperial whose\nundergraduate numbers\nhave remained approximately constant over the\nlast several years. Indeed,\nas of yet expanding has not\neven been a consideration.\nIt\u2019s a purely hypothetical\nquestion; the main lecture\ntheatre can only house 250\nstudents, and so growing\nfurther is impossible. The\ndepartment\u2019s stance is that\neven if they could expand,\nthey are not sure they\nwould want to:\n\u201cFor me it depends\non whether it improves\nthe teaching experience\nfor both students and\nstaff. I would worry very\nmuch \u2013 even if we had the\nspace \u2013 about increasing\nstudent numbers hugely\nuntil we have our student\nThe new computer suite has massively imrpoved functionality // Portsdown\nBlackett's Refurbs: A Different Approach to Lack of\n\u201cThe space\ndedicated to\nstudents is\nsimply not\nsufficient .\u201d\n\n"

So what can I say\nabout it that you couldn\u2019t\nfind at the back of the\nbook? Having completed\none year of university, I\nhave realised that the key\nto get through it is to know\nthat you are not alone,\nthat there is someone else\ngoing through the same\nthings as you, and this\nbook gives you that much\nneeded comfort.\nChemistry introduces\nus to the narrator, a bright\nbut confused Asian-American PhD student with\nintelligent, strict parents,\na smart, patient boyfriend,\na successful best friend,\nand an adorable dog. This\nseems like a life with little\nto complain about, and\nthe narrator\u2019s insecurity,\nanxiety, and indecisiveness is puzzling until she\nbegins to unfold its layers,\nand we start to see a struggling Asian-American\nPhD student with parents\nthat expect too much, a\nboyfriend too good for\nher, and a best friend she\nwould never be as successful as \u2013 a life not so perfect\nafter all. Chemistry in\nChinese means \u201cthe study\nof change\u201d, and the novel\ngracefully explores how\nthe relationships around\nher evolve the way they\ndo, as the narrator re-eval-uates her relationship with\nherself, and her passion\nfor science.\nAlthough narrated in\nfirst person, the narrator\noften seems detached from\ning one, and you will only\nbe surprised by all the\nthings it makes you feel as\nit progresses.\nWe enter university with\nthe determination to excel,\nbut it is not long before we\nstart questioning whether\nwe will even graduate,\nnot long before we relate\nstrongly to the narrator\u2019s\nvoice: \u201cThink small, I\ntell myself, think doable,\nthink of something that\nmight impress no one but\nwill still let you graduate\nand find a job.\u201d We often\nfeel burdened by all the\npressure, and sometimes\ncan\u2019t help but give up.\nChemistry assures us that\nsometimes it is okay to do\nso, while at the same time\nmakes us realise its effects\non others, especially our\nparents. In this beautiful\nnovel of self-discovery,\nwe also find the narrator\nunderstanding different\npoints of view, and why\nchose to write about it in\nthis section. Chemistry\npromises us that though\nit may not be in the ways\nwe expect, everything will\neventually fall into place.\nChemistry Cover // Vintage\n\u201cThe narrator\noften seems\ndetached from\nher own life\nas she adopts\na nonchalant\nand matter-of-fact tone\u201d\nher own life as she adopts\na nonchalant and matter-of-fact tone. The flow\nof the narrative is often\ninterrupted by stating\nrelated scientific facts that\neither compare, contrast,\nor somehow convey her\nfeelings about an event in\nher life. Take for example\nthe very beginning of the\nnovel \u2013 \u201cThe boy asks\nthe girl a question. It is a\nquestion of marriage. Ask\nme again tomorrow, she\nsays, and he says, that\u2019s\nnot how it works.\u201d \u2013 which\nis immediately followed\nby \u201cDiamond is no longer\nthe hardest mineral known\nto man.\u201d, to express her\ndoubts about the proposal.\nThis rather unique and\ndetached narration mostly\ncomes across as humour,\nyet we are able to understand that the narrator is\ntrying hard to find herself\nand make sense of her\nfeelings about her PhD, the\nproposal, and her parents.\nThus, despite the humour,\nthis novel manages to be\nan emotionally devastat-everyone around her is\nthe way they are, and\nwe observe a character\ndevelopment we not only\nrelate to, but also can\nlearn from.\nThis is one of the\nbooks I\u2019ve read that\ndidn\u2019t leave me even after\nI\u2019d finished it, and so I\n\u201cChemistry\npromises us\nthat, although\nit may not\nbe in ways\nwe expect,\neverything will\neventually fall\ninto place\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1727\nFELIX\n31\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe intellectual honesty of Robert Mugabe\nThe Zimbabwean leader stuck to his principles despite immense international pressure. It was\njust such a pity what those principles were.\nCOMMENT\nCalum Drysdale\nComment Editor\nT\no many in the\nWest Mugabe\nwas the archetypal African\ndictator. He came to\npower on the back of a\npopular independence\nmovement that promised to right the wrongs\ncaused by colonialism\nbut betrayed the principles that brought him to\noffice, enriching himself\nat the expense of his\npeople and cracking\ndown violently on any\nhint of criticism. News\nof his death was greeted\nin Harare with joy.\nHowever, in other\nAfrican nations he is\nremembered far more\nfondly. Mugabe managed\nto gain a reputation for\nbeing a man who stayed\ntrue to his principles\ndespite overwhelming\npressure from Western\nnations intent on interfering in an African nation\u2019s\nfuture. Despite all that\nhe did to impoverish his\ncountry, Mugabe\u2019s funeral\nwas still attended by\npast and current African\nleaders who came to celebrate his achievements.\nThe reason for this\nenduring respect is\nnot based on a code of\nhonour among thieves or\na similar support mechanism among kleptocratic\nleaders. Instead Mugabe\nwas honoured for being\na man that had remained\ntrue to his principles, the\nideologies that he had\nespoused as a guerrilla\nleader in the Rhodesian\nBush War that precipitated Zimbabwe\u2019s independ-ence.\nThese ideologies were\npan-Africanism and\nanti-colonialism with an\nemphasis on land reform\nand following his rise to\npower in 1980. It was on\nthis basis that Mugabe\nproceeded rather than the\npromotion of democracy\nor civil liberties. When\nviewed through the\nlenses of these ideologies,\nMugabe\u2019s later actions\nbecome much clearer.\nPan-Africanism is the\nbelief that the fates and\nconcerns of the black\ncitizens of all African\nnations and the members\nof the diaspora are inter-linked, and that through\n\u2018collective self-reliance\u2019\nand unity, a great redistribution of strength\nand economic power to\nAfrica can be achieved.\nHowever, central to this\nideal is the notion of\nunity, that every black\nAfrican, wherever they\nare, must rally behind a\nsingle cause. Bastardised\nby Mugabe, this was used\nnot simply to justify a\nmove towards absolute\nstate control but was the\nvery reason for it.\nMugabe had no interest\nin a multi-party system.\nIndeed, he regarded it\nas a Western imposition.\nMugabe was able to\ncome to power because\nthe British observer of\nthe election declined\nto disqualify Mugabe\u2019s\nZANU-PF party despite\nbrazen voter intimidation\nbecause, by representing\nthe Shona who made up\n70% of the population,\nit was clearly headed\ntowards victory. In the\nLeninist style, he saw\nthe democratic process\nas a vehicle for realising\nhis views and remaking\nZimbabwe as a place for\nblack Africans.\nOnce in power, the need\nfor unity necessitated the\nsuppression of those that\nwould not follow him.\nThe best example of this\nis the campaign of terror\nor Gukurahundi (meaning\n\u2018wind that sweeps away\nthe chaff before the\nrains\u2019) that was launched\nagainst Matabeleland, a\nstronghold of the ZAPU,\na rival faction during the\nindependence struggle.\nAfter three years of\nviolence the ZAPU were\ncoerced into merging\n(rather than disbanding)\nwith Mugabe\u2019s ZANU-PF\nmaking Zimbabwe a de\nfacto one-party state.\nThe same is true\nof Mugabe\u2019s attitude\ntowards the white farmers\nwho, as a result of racially\nbased land allocation\nowned 51% of fields, all\nof which were suited to\nagriculture, leaving the\nblack majority with only\nan infertile and unsuitable\n22%. As this imbalance\nwas a consequence of\ncolonialism, Mugabe saw\nland reform as another\nvital aim. Immediately\nafter his election a policy\nof \u2018Willing Seller Willing\nBuyer\u2019 was launched with\nthe financial assistance\nof the United Kingdom\nthat pledged to fund half\nproperties were acquired\nbefore finally elevating\nthe process above the\njudiciary into the purely\npolitical realm did not\nsucceed in reducing white\ncontrol of prime farm\nlands.\nThe 1997 election of\nNew Labour marked a\nchange in policy after the\nSecretary for International\ndevelopment announced\n\u201cI should make it clear\nthat we do not accept\nthat Britain has a special\nresponsibility to meet the\ncosts of land purchase in\nZimbabwe. We are a new\ngovernment from diverse\nbackgrounds without\nlinks to former colonial\ninterests. My own origins\nare Irish and, as you\nknow, we were colonised,\nnot colonisers.\u201d\nFollowing this\nannouncement, the\nZANU-PF began drafting\na new constitution that\nwould permit compulsory\nland purchase without\ncompensation. While at\nthis point the government\nwas highly corrupt, the\nimportance that was\nplaced on seizing land\nfrom white farmers is\nindicative of the importance that was placed on\nexpunging the traces of\nEuropean colonialism.\nThis anti-colonial\nattitude extended to\naccepting help or even\nengaging in friendly relations with those that were\nregarded as complicit\nin the colonial process.\nWhen Obama exhorted\nAfrican nations to be\nmore tolerant towards\nnon heterosexuals\nMugabe was reported to\nhave said that if Obama\ncared so much about gay\npeople, he should come to\nZimbabwe and Mugabe\nwould marry him. It was\nthis attitude of defiance\nthat made Mugabe a\nhero to those that saw\nthe West\u2019s preaching and\naid as a descendent of the\nviolent imperialism of\nearlier generations.\nFor these reasons,\ndespite the excesses\nof the later years of\nMugabe\u2019s rule, he is\nstill regarded as an\nidealist, who despite the\nimmense pressure he\nwas put under, refused\nto bow to the white man.\nMugabe was a teacher in Ghana// Wikimedia\n\u201cIt was on\nthis basis\nthat Mugabe\nproceded\nrather than the\npromotion of\ndemocracy or\ncivil liberties\u201d\nI have\u201ca degree in violence\u201d- Rober Mugabe// Latimes\nthe value of any land\nbought with Zimbabwe\nfooting the remaining\nhalf.

    "content": "The N-Camera Smartphone Trend\nWhat are the advantages of having multiple cameras on smartphones?\nTECH\nSudarshan Sreeram\nTech Editor\nIntroduction\nO\nver the years of\nour lives on this\nplanet, we have\nfound multiple\nways to document our\npast. One of these ways,\nphotography, has emerged\nas the most widespread\nand effective way to\nrecord our daily lifestyles.\nWith the ability to capture\nthe state of our world at the\nsimple click of a button,\ncameras have proved to be\none of the most important\ntools in human history.\nThe saying, \u201cA picture is\nworth a thousand words,\u201c\ntruly marks how cameras\nhave become our go-to\ntool for creating visual\njournals; they save the\ntime and effort to maintain\nwritten ones.\nToday, smartphones\nprove to be the most\naccessible way to use a\ncamera. With the rise of\nsocial media and competition between vendors,\nsmartphone camera\nmodules have received a\ncomplete overhaul from\nwhat they were a decade\nago.\nEvolution of Cameras\nIn the early 2000s,\nh i g h - p e r f o r m a n c e\ncameras were rarely made\nfor the regular consumer.\nBesides, these tools were\nhighly-priced and rather\nbulky. Pocket cameras,\noften called point-and-shoots, were the most\npopular among buyers,\nespecially tourists and\nhobbyists. With the rise\nin popularity of mobile\nhandsets, it only made\nsense for vendors to bring\nin the camera as an added\nselling point, thus making\ncameras ubiquitous.\nThis move took off and\npresented a high demand\nfor cameras to eventually\nbecome a standard feature\nofthemodernsmartphone.\nConveniently, it made for\none less device to carry\naround while traveling,\nthus significantly reducing\nthe overall footprint of the\ncamera. However, this\nshift saw manufacturers\nface challenges related to\nthe performance, quality,\nand feature set of mobile\ncamera modules.\nSocial Media and\nCompetition\nWith the rise of im-age-based social media,\nespecially Instagram\nand Snapchat, the urge\nto share our lives with\nothers through pictures\nhas been more than\never; in other words, it\u2019s\nmore like maintaining a\ncommon visual journal\nwhere one could share\ntheir lives with others.\nThis rise has marked\ndemand for smartphones\nwith more-capable,\nhigh-performing camera\nsystems, thus placing\npressure on smartphone\nproducers to innovate and\npush out devices that meet\nthe needs of the buyer.\nNeedless to say, this is, in\nfact, a profit-making opportunity for these com-panies. However, it\u2019s the\ncompetition between them\nto secure a higher share of\nprofit that drives the innovation behind building\ncamera modules that offer\na wide array of pro-level\nfeatures to the end-user.\nThis healthy competition\nprimarily results in consumers gaining access to\nhigh quality, feature-filled\nproducts at an affordable\nprice. One of the recent\n\u201cIn 2016, our\nworld saw the\nshift towards\nmultiple\ncamera\nsmartphones,\u201d\ninnovative approaches\nis to introduce the multi-ple-camera setup.\nThe Multiple Camera\nSmartphone\nIn 2016, our world saw\nthe shift towards multiple\ncamera smartphones,\nstarting successfully\nwith the iPhone 7 Plus.\nTraditional cameras, such\nas DSLRs, mirrorless,\nand point-and-shoots, are\ncomposed of single-lens\nsystems. In the case of\nDSLRs and mirrorless\ncameras, these systems\noften have the capability\nof swapping lenses to offer\nflexibility in the degree\nof zoom while maintaining image quality;\nthey\u2019re often referred to\nshoots). Thus, the image\nproduced would have\nreduced image quality.\nOn the other hand, in the\ncase of optical zoom,\nthe camera utilizes lens\noptics to shift the focus to\na nearer or further point\nwhile maintaining image\nquality.\nDevices housing these\nsystems are often bulky,\nespecially when the lens\nsystem is extended to\nmatch the zoom level.\nSmartphones, on the other\nhand, are considerably\nthinner and can\u2019t afford\nthe space to accommodate\nfully-fledged single-lens\nsystems as found in\npoint-and-shoots, let\nalone the interchangeable\nlens systems of DSLRs\nand mirrorless cameras.\nInstead, they house small,\ncompact cameras that rely\nheavily on digital zoom.\nSmartphone producers\nfaced the challenge to introduce optical zoom into\ntheir cameras while maintaining the same thin form\nTECH\nFRIDAY, 27TH\nSEPTEMBER, 2019 FELIX\ntecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n36\nSmartphones vs Pro\nCameras\nWith all this talk about\nhow smartphone cameras\nare getting better, you\nmust be wondering how\nthey match up with professional cameras. Well,\nto be fair, smartphones\nare far behind high-end\nDSLRs and mirrorless\ncameras primarily due to\nthe lack of larger image\nsensors. Image sensors act\nas the retina of cameras;\nit\u2019s the part that captures\nlight and records the information through pixels. In\nmost cases, the larger the\nsensor size, the better the\nimage quality. In addition,\nthe low light performance\nof smartphone cameras\nis comparatively poorer\nto those of pro-cameras.\nBefore further discussion\non understanding how\nThe new iPhone\u2019s multiple cameras are one of its prominent features// Apple\nfactor of the phone. Thus,\nmultiple camera systems\nwere born. Here, a second\ncamera, containing a\ntelephoto lens, facilitates\nthe system to operate at\ndifferent focal lengths,\nthus being able to capture\nhigh-quality zoomed-in\nimages. Furthermore,\nthe multiple lens system\nmade way for portrait\nphotos to be possible on\nsmartphones, albeit with a\nlot of software assistance\nin the background.

On the other\nhand, point-and-shoots\nhave a single lens system\nthat\u2019s capable of capturing\nimages across multiple\nzoom levels, albeit with\ndiminished image quality;\nhere, the lens system is\nintegrated into the body of\nthe camera. Most low-cost\npoint-and-shoots make\nuse of digital zoom rather\nthan optical zoom, which\nis heavily used in the\nhigher end cameras.\nWith digital zoom,\nthe camera crops into a\nsection of the image taken\nat the highest optical\nzoom level (Typically 5x\non standard point-and-FELIX\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n36\n\n"

It is\ngreat that people now have\nthe option to jump straight\ninto a game without those\ndreaded downloads, installations and updates.\nFurthermore, it is, in\nfact, a cheaper option\nIF you stick to only one\nor two of the services,\nhowever, as mentioned\nabove that is unlikely to\nbe the case in the future.\nAll of these positives\nare great, and for some\npeople streaming is going\nto be the perfect solution\nthey have always looked\nfor, but a lot of gamers\nmay not look upon this as\nkindly.\nWhat Gamers Want\nA lot of people who\nhave grown up gaming\nview it as more than just\na hobby. Gaming is a\npassion and is something\nthat people identify with.\nMany find joy in owning\nand collecting a slew of\ngames from a variety\nof consoles and lining\nthem up on shelves just\nlike books. This kind of\ngamer is not one to buy\ninto game streaming, as\nthe lack of physical ownership (or even digital for\nthat matter) takes away\ntheir enjoyment. This is\npertinent as the Neilsen\u2019s\nannual US 360 Report - A\nlarge scale American\nsurvey company - stated\nthat 66% of people buy\nphysical games rather than\ndigital when it comes to\nconsole games. This study\nwas taken with over 2000\nparticipants and was made\nto be representative of\nthe US population. With\n66% of people wanting\nphysical games, it seems\nunlikely that video game\nstreaming will majorly\npick up steam the same\nway TV streaming has in\nrecent years.\nEqually, hardcore PC\ngamers probably would\nnot want to buy into\nstreaming either. According to the same report,\n71% of PC gamers buy\ndigitally meaning they\nare more likely to want to\nstream games, however,\nwhen it comes to hardcore\ngamers the issue of the\ndata cap comes back. Any\nhardcore PC player will\nadmit they play far more\nthan 20 hours a month of\ntheir favourite game so\neven if they like the idea\nof having games easily\navailable to them, the\nsimple lack of bandwidth\nwould limit them too\nmuch.\nThere are however\nundoubtedly people who\nwill love the streaming\nidea. Those who are more\ncasually into games and\nwant to pick up and play\nanytime with any game\nthey fancy will definitely\nrelish the opportunity to\ngrab a subscription to a\nservice. This is with a\nsimilar mindset to how\nthey would have a Netflix\nor Spotify subscription.\nWhat\u2019s the Verdict?\nLooking at all the pros,\ncons and types of people\nthat would be interested,\nit seems like there is a\ngrowing market out there\nfor video game streaming,\nbut it\u2019s just not that large.\nThis is mainly from sheer\nlack of internet availability and people still loving\ntheir physical copies of\ngames. If anything the\nmost likely course will be\nthat a couple of the bigger\nsubscription services\nwill succeed, and others,\nwhich have caused this\noversaturation, will fade\nAn all eat you can eat platter of PS4 exlcusives with PS Now// PC Mag Uk\nA new controller by Google to get to grips with// Tech Crunch\naway in a similar way to\nhow the first few generations of consoles many\nmore competitors, even\ngreater than the number of\nstreaming services available today.\n\n"

What are the positives and negatives? will\nit flourish in the current market? With further insight\ninto the Google Stadia and whether it can achieve the\nlevel of success it needs to thrive.\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\n\u201cUnlike TV and\nfilm, streaming\nvideo games is\nnot just a oneway street.\u201d\nI\nn the last decade, we\nhave started to see\ndifferent forms of\nmedia shift towards\na \u2018cloud-based\u2019 market.\nA customer does not need\nto own the media they\nconsume but instead can\nstream it online (with the\ncaveat of a required steady\ninternet connection).\nThis has been unarguably\nsuccessful within both\nthe music and film/series\nindustry, with the recent\nexplosion of services\nsuch as Spotify, Netflix,\nAmazon Prime, Apple\nTV+ and Disney+ just to\nname a small fraction of\nthe current market. So, the\nquestion is, will this work\nfor video games? Well\u2026\nthat depends on a few\nfactors.\nHow Does It Work?\nUnlike TV and film,\nstreaming video games is\nnot just a one-way street.\nWhen a video game is\nstreamed to a computer,\nphone or tablet, the servers\nresponsible for sending\nthe game information to\nyou must also receive\nyour controller inputs at\nthe same time. This means\nthat there is a lot more\nthat could go wrong and\nmost importantly a much\nfaster internet connection\nis required.\nThe Internet Issue\nIn the world of game\nstreaming, Google Stadia\nhas recently come under\nthe spotlight with a\nmixed response. During\nE3 this year we learnt a\nlot more about Stadia\u2019s\ntech requirements. The\nbare minimum internet\nspeed required is 10Mbps,\nwhich for some is already\nan issue. To play 4k at\n60 FPS, you are going\nto need a hefty 35Mbps.\nNow I don\u2019t know about\nyou guys but personally,\nmy budget student WiFi\ndoes not let me play at\n4k so the benefit of being\nable to play on my phone\nor tablet (a major selling\npoint of Stadia) is virtually non-existent.\nEven with an ethernet\nconnection and fast\nenough internet to comfortably stream games,\nmany countries put data\ncaps on a household\u2019s\nmonthly internet usage.\nPlaying games on max\nsettings will mean you are\nspending around 16Gb\nper hour. With the typical\ndata caps, this allots\nyou about 20 hours of\ngameplay a month. \u201cBut\nthat\u2019s plenty of time!\u201d\nI hear you cry through\nthe pages. That may be\nplenty for some but if we\nconsider all the Netflix\nusage and \u201cLo-fi hip hop\nbeats to chill/ study to\u201d we\nall know and love, then\nit will be closer to half\nthat in reality. 10 hours\na month is completely\nunreasonable when many\npeople easily game that\nmuch in a single week\u2026\nand just the mention of rationing my Netflix usage\nis already giving my free\ntime shivers.\nThe Money Problem\nSo not only do we have\nissues with the internet,\nbut another growing\nissue is the dividing up\nof the market. Before\nstreaming, you could\nplay most games with a\nNintendo console and one\nof the other big 3 (minus\nwith OnLive, there was\nno issue with what games\nyou could play with a\nwide variety of options\nand only one subscription\npayment you had to worry\nabout.\nBut now, everyone\nseems to be jumping\nat the chance to stream\ngames. Google Stadia,\nNvidia GeForce Now,\nPlayStation Now and\nupcoming: Project xCloud\nand EA\u2019s \u201cProject Atlas\u201d\nare all options, and that\u2019s\nnot even mentioning\nthe plethora of smaller\ncompanies. Firstly, think\nof my poor wallet that is\nalready being emptied by\nthe Netflixes and Spotifies\nof this world. Now if I\nwant to experience all the\nexclusive options from\nthese companies, I will\nhave to divvy out even\nmore cash for the dreaded\nmonthly subscription.\nThis is made worse by the\npotential for even more\nexclusive content with\nGoogle Stadia already\nconfirmed to have many\nexclusives coming to its\nservice.\nAlthough there are\nmany negatives to this\nnew gaming model, let us\nponder the positives that\ncome out from streaming\ngames.\nPotential Positives\nFirstly, it is important\nto mention that it is by no\nmeans necessary to stream\ngames in order to keep up\nwith the hottest things in\ngaming. The exclusives\nwhich ARE coming out\nare not the big-budget\ntitles from decades-old\nfranchises that everybody\nloves, Orcs Must Die 3\n(yeah me neither) being\nthe biggest one. So, if\nyou are not yet ready for\na streaming filled future\nyou do not have to be \u2026\nyet.\nThe biggest positive\naspect of video game\nstreaming is that no\nlonger do you have to\nAn infographic of the required internet speeds and respective qualities for Stadia // Tech Crunch\n\u201cNow if I\nwant to\nexperience all\nthe exclusive\noptions\nfrom these\ncompanies,\nI will have to\ndivvy out even\nmore cash for\nthe dreaded\nmonthly\nsubscription..\u201d\nobvious exclusives). It\nmeant that there was a\nchoice you had to make,\nbut nothing major. When\ncloud-based video game\nstreaming started (albeit\nvery shakily) in 2010\n\n"

The strike was\nalso heavily supported\nby scientists, with over\n2000 from across the\nglobe pledging support.\nStrikers reported seeing\na large proportion of\nyoung people \u2013 especially\nstudents from university,\nhigh school, and primary\nschool \u2013 attending.\nThe strikes follow a\nnew surge of climate\nactivism support among\nyoung people, largely\nspurred by Swedish\nteenager Greta Thunberg,\nwho has been fiercely\ncampaigning for global\nreform on climate policy\nfor over a year \u2013 giving\nspeeches to politicians in\nmultiple countries, at UN\nsummits, and the World\nEconomic Forum.\nThe UK strikes were\norganised by the UK\nStudent Climate Network\n(UKSCN), with over\n200 events taking place\naround the UK, and were\nsupported by various\nunions around the country\n\u2013 including the University\nandCollegeUnion(UCU).\nLiaising with the UKSCN\nwas Divest Imperial, a\nstudent-led campaign\nthat aims to challenge the\ncollege to cease investing\nin fossil fuel-based com-panies, alongside other\ngroups such as the Environmental Society, ICU\nand the GSU, and Imperial Extinction Rebellion.\nDivest mobilised Imperial\nstudents, encouraging\nthem to meet outside the\nfaculty building (or \u2018blue\ncube\u2019) in Dalby Court and\nmarch to the strike together \u2013 with the hope that\nthe visual display might\ninspire faculty staff to\nsupport climate activism\nat Imperial in future.\nIn a joint action, the\nImperial UCU\u2019s presi-dent, Michael McGarvey,\norganised a climate demo\non the Queen\u2019s Lawn,\nwhich was attended by\naround 200 people and\nfeatured speeches given\nby megaphone on a range\nof climate change-related\ntopics. He also spearheads\nthe UCU\u2019s side of the\nFossil Fuel Divestment\nCampaign, which liaises\nwith groups such as Divest\nto pressure the college.\nImperial is known to\nbe heavily invested in\nfossil fuel companies via\nits investment portfolio,\nas reported by Felix in\nJanuary 2018, as well as\nhaving tight industry links\nwith companies \u2013 such\nas BP, who sponsored\nseveral academic documents handed to students\nin Mechanical Engineering last year. The college\nPresident, Alice Gast, sits\non the board of Chevron,\none of the world\u2019s largest\noil companies, and receives a \u00a3300,000 a year\nsalary for it (Dec 2018);\nthe college portfolio has\nat least \u00a36.5 million (Oct\n2018) directly invested\nin fossil fuel companies\nand oil field services,\nand even more likely to\nbe indirectly invested via\nmanaged funds; and fuel\ncompanies also invest into\nthe college.\nAs a result, Imperial\nplaces 130th out of 154\nuniversities in the UK\non the People and Planet\nUniversity League tables,\nwhich ranks universities\nbased on their ethical and\nenvironmental performance \u2013 receiving a 0%\nscore on both the environmental policy and ethical\ninvestment categories.\nIn spite of this, there is\nalso a scientific dedication\nacross many departments\nto researching sustainable\nenergy across much of the\ncollege \u2013 and in this regard\nImperial is a world leader,\nwith research groups such\nas the Energy Futures Lab,\nthe Sustainable Energy\ngroup in the RSM, and the\nGrantham Institute.\nThe Divest campaign\npredominantly focuses its\ntime on researching the\nconnections between Imperial and the fossil fuel\nindustry, creating workshops and training, organising protests on campus,\nand liaising with other\nlikeminded groups such\nas Fossil Free London and\nStudent Climate Action.\nThey pressure college and\nmeet with management\nin order to make the case\nfor divestment; however,\nthey feel that the college\nis not receptive to their\nmessage.\n\u201cDivestment is not\nsimple or easy \u2013 we know\nthat. But as a student, I\nwant to see from college\nany sort of commitment\n\u2013 especially for an institution which is so involved\nin sustainability research,\u201d\nsaid Ruben, a member of\nDivest. \u201cWe need to do it,\nto make a stand, and have\nsome integrity. Imperial\nhas a lot of influence\nwithin the fossil fuel\nbusiness \u2013 by divesting,\nthey can encourage those\ncompanies to change their\nfocus.\u201d\nMichael echoed this\nnotion. He believes that\nthis type of collective\naction between staff and\nstudents is essential to\ninstigating change.\n\u201cYou can have individuals making lifestyle\ndecisions, but we have to\nchange the systems that\nproduce fossil fuel on a\ngrand scale. Given the\nfuture repercussions of\nclimate change, we need\nmoral leadership. The tangible thing we can do as\nan organisation is to send\nout a strong message.\u201d\nFossil fuel companies\nhave been shown to have\nbeen aware of the potential risks of fossil fuel dependence since research\nconducted during the\n1980s, and actively Oil\ncompanies have invested\nover \u00a3200 million per\nyear into lobbying against\nclimate change awareness\nsince the Paris Agreement. Investigations conducted by UK non-profity\ninfluencemap furthermore\nreveal that fossil fuel\ncompanies collectively\ninvest only 3% of their\n$115 billion investment\ninto sustainability. Additionally, there are around\nsixty universities across\nthe UK who have already\ndivested, including other\nRussell Group universities such as Edinburgh.\nDespite this, Naomi Pratt,\na head figure in Divest,\nsays that the college has\nrepeatedly stated that\nthey consider fossil fuel\ncompanies \u201cpartners in\nthe fight against climate\nchange.\u201d\nRecently, the UCU\nand Divest met with the\nProvost to propose and\ndiscuss plans to divest,\nfocusing on three key\npoints: an ethical investment policy that includes\nstaff and students, a 5-year\ndivestment plan such that\nthere is a slow withdraw-al, and a dedication to\nconducting the process\npublicly (rather than dis-creetly.) However, there is\nlittle indication from the\ncollege that there are any\nplans to divest soon.\nA hundred thousand people gathered in central London for the climate strike last Friday // Mark Marra\nThe Climate Strikes Back\n\u201cWe need to\nmake a stand,\nand have some\nintegrity.\u201d\nISSUE 1727\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOn Friday 20th September, climate strikes organised predominantly by young activists took place across the\nglobe. Imperial students and sta\ufb00 were at the forefront of that action.\n\n"

For many of\nyou, university will be\nunlike anything you will\nhave experienced; here\nyou have an ownership\nof your education and\ntogether we can change\nthings.\nThis is what Unions\nare for.

As President, I\u2019m ultimately responsible for\nthe activities of the Union, and representing the interests of students to College.\nI ran for this position because, for all its strengths, our\nuniversity could do more for its students. With this in\nmind, this year I\u2019ll be working to increase student rep-resentation, as well as the representation of academic/\nsupport staff, at the highest levels of College. I want to\nensure that wherever possible, the people affected by\ndecisions are directly involved in the decision-making\nprocess, whether that\u2019s around our courses, the cost of\nfood on campus, or student services.\nWithin the Union, my priorities are communication,\npreserving and improving our offer to students, and\ngetting our student staff paid the London living wage.\nWe\u2019re also going to be asking for your input in helping\nus set priorities for the next three years. I want to make\nsure you have opportunities to make your voice heard,\nand that we let you know what\u2019s going on, so that\ntogether, we can make Imperial a better place.\nHi, I\u2019m Ashley, your Deputy President (Educa-tion) for this year!

It\u2019s already been a busy summer\nworking on the Union\u2019s response to the most recent\nNational Student Survey (NSS), and I\u2019m pleased to say\nthat our recommendations (formed from a close reading\nof student\u2019s comments and in close collaboration with\nstudent reps), have been well received, and endorsed,\nby the most senior college committees.

This tends to fall into my day-to-day tasks, and you can often find me at my\ndesk reading sponsorship contracts.\nThe other official half of my job is services and making sure that what both\nImperial College Union and College offer meet the needs of you, the students. I also\noften get involved with College services to represent student views. Also head to\nmy bio on the Unions webpage to start to have your say on the Summer Ball 2020!!\nMy underlying aim is to make lasting and sustainable changes across the services\nwe offer students, and so will chair a Services & Sustainability Board this year as\nwell as working with Greening Imperial! Ultimately, I want to be part of ensuring\nyou graduate from Imperial proud of the institute and your Union.\nHi, my name\u2019s Thomas and I\u2019m your Deputy President (Clubs & Societies). Half\nDutch, half Spanish, I moved from Hong Kong to London to study Biomedical\nEngineering at Imperial.\nLittle did I know most of my personal and professional development would come\nthrough my time on the Lawn Tennis Club committee and as Sport Chair. Clubs,\nSocieties & Projects (commonly referred to as CSPs) are a great place to meet\nlike-minded people with similar interests and they provide invaluable development\nopportunities as they\u2019re all student-led.\nThis year, I\u2019m looking forward to working with elected volunteers to facilitate,\npromote and celebrate our 350+ CSPs \u2013 you can meet them across the South Kensington campus at Welcome Fair on Tuesday. With projects ranging from working\nwith sports clubs to implement the Sports Hub, promoting Arts & Entertainment\nclubs through their own bar nights, to engaging all CSPs to celebrate their events\nthrough the Union\u2019s central social media channels, it\u2019s going to be a busy year but\nI\u2019m looking forward to it!\n\n"
