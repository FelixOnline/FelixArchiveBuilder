This is Fascism).\nTheir line, a hard, burning\ngroove, etches itself around the idea\nthat fascist aggression is reborn, to\na certain extent, in dance culture.\nIt is by no means short of a frightening vision of people so\nsubservient that they are sublimated\nso easily.

Cohn' s voice carries a thread of silver,\nwhich along with its flexibility\nmakes him the best new male\nvocalist for ages. More variation in\nhis accompaniments would help -both in style and media, but I like\nwhat he does and I suppose he\nknows which way his music is\ngoing.

A lumbering avalanche of fucked-up noise guitar,\nthe caustic scream of venom like T seen your repulsion and it looks real\ngood on you', and the rusted iron\ntouch of Sonic Youth'sKim Gordon\nconspire to make a cocktail somewhat lethal. Two parts\nhydrochloric acid, one part\nmercury, ring the glass rim with\nquick-lime. The stereo's playing\nHendrix and Sabbath slowed down\nto 12 R.P.M. With Lydia Lunch on\nvocals. Sounds about right - Jesus,\nit's bitter; the other songs are pretty\nugly too, more grim, monstrous\nsavagery from a strangely beautiful\nwoman called Courtney Love.

    "content": "News Felix9151 November1991 Accident Prompts\nVehicle Ban\nAll vehicles are to be banned from\nmascot ry, it was decided on Monday. A meeting of various\nmembers of the Union and Constituent College Unions ( C CU), including the executives decided\nthat since vehicles are 'harder than\neven rugby players' they should be\ntotally excluded from mascot ry. The meeting was arranged before\nthe motor accident reported last\nweek, but it has figured largely in\ntheir proposed future rules for\nmascot ry, designed to improve the\nsport rather than ending it, as the\nRector, Sir Eric, had proposed in\na letter.\nTwo other major changes are also\nmooted: firstly, mascots should be\nput on inviolate display in college\ndepartments. This means that they\nmay not be-stolen in a raid, but must\nbe taken to a minimum of two C CU events per term, and secondly,\nduring rag week the mascots will be\ntaken out every day. If stolen they\nwill be returned by midnight to\nregister one 'capture'. These will be\ntotalled at the end of rag and a mascot exchange effected (when\nthey will be inviolate). The most\nstolen mascot will be awarded an\nextra fine, payable to rag.\nOther suggestions include a fixed\nsum for violation of a mascot. This\nwould be scaled relative to C CU sizes. The R SMU is to be made\ninviolate since their numbers are\ndepleted, and a complete set of rules\nare to be displayed in each C CU office. This would be designed to\nmake sure participants realise that\nthey are responsible for their own safety.\nThe proposals are to be discussed\nthis evening (Friday) at a meeting\nof bearers, C CU Vice Presidents\nand C CU Presidents.\nSIL WOOD PARK ENTS PRESENT THE LEGENDARY...\nSILWOOD PARK\nBONFIRE NIGHT\nPARTY!\nwith:\nLIVE BAND * BONFIRE\nBARBECUE * FIREWORKS\nDISCO TIL YOU DIE\nTORCHLIGHT PROCESSION\nFRIDAY8 NOV All this and return coach ticket for \u00a37.00\nTickets NOW available from IC Union Office\nWelfare\nWeek\nWilts\nThe Imperial College Union Welfare Week finished yesterday.\nAccording to Zoe Hellinger, Union\nPresident, attendance was 'poorer\nthan expected'. Four people\nattended the anti-stress seminar last\nTuesday and there was a zero\nattendance at the smoking seminar.\nThe numbers attending the Health\nFair were said to be similar to last\nyear. Posters advertising the\nWelfare Week arrived last\nThursday after problems arising\nwith the artwork, but they were not\nput up until Monday and Tuesday\nof this week.\nPlay Stopped\nAfter Rain\nViolence broke out in the Union Building last Friday night, after the\nband ' Rain' played in the Union Lounge.\nGraham Lawton, Ents chairman,\nsaid a long running dispute between\nstudents and people attracted to the\nUnion by Bar extensions had caused\nthe recent outburst of violence. He continued by saying that security\nwill not intervene in disputes, but\nwill call the police. The individuals\ninvolved are to face a disciplinary\ncommittee next Friday.\nPyrotechnic\nParty\nThere will be two fireworks\ndisplays next week in Battersea.\nThe traditional display will take\nplace in Battersea Park SW11, while another will occur in King George's Park (off Garratt Lane)\nsimultaneously. The King George'sPark display has had music specially commissioned for it,\nwhich was successfully used in\nthe Tooting firework display last\nSaturday. Both bonfires will be lit\non the 5th November at 7.30pm with the fireworks starting at\n8.00pm Lord\nMayor's Show\nOn Saturday 9th November, City\nand Guild College Union will be\nparticipating in the Lord Mayor's Show. This annual event marks the\nchange from the old to the new\nMayor. The show will start at about\n11.00am at London Wall and will\nfollow a route through the City\npassing St. Paul's, the Guildhall and\nwill stop at the Monument for lunch\nat approximately 12.30pm. The float will then return by a more\ndirect route to the starting point.\nThis year's float has models of a communications satellite and a building from Canary Wharf.\nTraditionally, City and Guilds are\nallowed a float for free whereas the\ncompanies taking part have to pay.\nAccess to the route can be obtained\nfrom either Moorgate, Bank,\nMansion House or Monument underground stations.\nNew Hon Sec\nCity and Guilds College Union( C& GU) have a new Honorary\nSecretary, following an election\nheld last Tuesday. Kate Dalton was\nelected over Joanne Brown by 48\nvotes to 35.\nThe election could have been\ndeclared void as the manifestoes\nprinted in Guildsheet broke election\nregulations. The two contestants'\nentries were not put in alphabetical\norder, but as no objection has been\nraised, the result still stands. Jim Shaw, Guildsheet Editor, admitted\nresponsibility to printing the\nmanifestoes in the wrong order but\nsaid that he felt it had not affected\nthe election and that, to his\nknowledge, no action was being\ntaken by Joanne Brown to annul the\nelection.\nNo Parking\nNo parking will be allowed on the\n7th,8 th and 9th November from\nPrince Consort road northwards to\nHyde Park. Loading, unloading and\nsetting down of passengers will be\nprohibited. This is because Remembrance Sunday events are to\nbe held nearby.\n\u2014 2 0 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "1 November1991 Felix 915 Editorial\neditor i a Admission of Guilt\nOne of the front page news stories\nof Felix last week was entitled\n'Super Plug'. There was not much\nin the way of truth in it. I could bore\nyou with a flawless moral justification of why it was done, but\nI 'll take pity. The picture was of Alec Baldwin, by the way, so in\naddition to a polo gi sing to the\ngeneral populace for the joke,\nwhoever it was that phoned up the\nFelix office insisting that the picture\nwas of' a famous Hollywood actor'\nwas right.\nThere was a factual inaccuracy in\nthe story called ' A Day Too Long' on the back page. This is covered\nin response to a letter on the\nfollowing letters pages.\nGeneral Idiocy\nWe appear to have a psychopath on\nthe loose in college. And for a change, it's not working in Sherfield. Apparently there have\nbeen three attempts to light the lift\nshaft in Southside since term began.\nUnfortunately I did not receive this\ninformation until it was too late to\nresearch it fully, though I know that\nthe fire in the lift at the east end of Southside last Saturday morning is\nbelieved to be the one attempt that\nwas successful. Also, security\ncleared an armchair from one of the\nmain fire exits at that end of the\nbuilding minutes before the fire\nalarm went off.\nCall me old-fashioned, but I take\npersonal offence when some person\nor persons unknown try to murder\nme and 400 others while we are\nasleep. Setting light to a lift is an\nincredibly effective way of killing\nas many people in a building as\npossible in a short time and I hope\nAnyone interested\nin attending the London Film Festival please\ncome to a meeting in the Felix Office at12.45 pm, Tuesday5 th November. the culprit is found and dealt with\nseverely, because they may decide\nto attempt mass murder again.\nIt seems to have become acceptable amongst some members\nof the student body to resort to\nviolence when they don't get their\nway. This is not acceptable, and\nwhen it occurs under Union jurisdiction it should be made clear\nthat it is not acceptable by the\nUnion. There is no excuse for\nletting off a student for hitting\nsomebody because of 'high jinx' or\ninebriation - it is a criminal offence\nand must be treated as such.\nFar less seriously, but equally\ncriminal, many of the new gold\nlettering door signs in the Union building have already been stolen.\nThis is partly because the company\nthat put them up did not use security\nscrews, but mainly because many\nstudents seem to have an odd 'open\nseason' attitude on other people's property. Similarly, if I find out\nwho stole the bog roll from the\nFelix office, their life will not be\nworth living.\nSex Orgy in Concert Hall\nThere will be a Union General\nMeeting ( U GM) next Thursday in\nthe Union Concert Hall at 6.00pm. Motions should be submitted to the\nUnion office by 2.30pm next\nWednesday. This is your chance to\ndirect Union events - by not\nattending you are declaring that the\nUnion is running superbly and\nneeds no changes. So if you want\nto no-confidence me or any other\nsabbatical, get cracking. See Steve\nFarrant's article on page 4.\nUnion Office Deadlines\nThis is positively the last time I consider making space for any\narticles coming in late from the\nUnion Office. The Felix office is\nnot exactly far from the Union Office, and merely telling me that\nan article is on the way is not good\nenough - 1 had to severely edit two\narticles lor the Union page to make\nit all fit. Next time I shall burn the\narticle in front of the sabbatical in\nquestion. I know that they are busy,\nbut so am I and I don't see why I should make exceptions for them.\nI will mention no names but she\nknows who she is.

Helen Adams battled\nbravely in the ladies team, despite\nbeing outnumbered4:1, but\neventually had to concede defeat.\nThe C team produced a magnificent performance by\nwinning, despite being a man short.\nBoth Matt Bell (400 series) and\nDave Williams (385) bowled above\naverage in carrying the team to\nvictory. The B team rallied well\nafter losing the first game to\ntriumph31, with Wayne Whiteman providing the\ninspiration. Congratulations to Don Taverner for avoiding the ignominy\nof bowling below a blind score with\nhis final game rally.\nThe A team recovered well to\nsnatch a22 draw with the last\nframe of the match.

In particular wins\nwere recorded in the Senior 3,\nSenior 2 and Novice classes, with\na further 3 second placings attained\nas well.\nThe Novice-cox ed four (Myers,\nPuttick, Florence and Chadia)\nrepeated the success of last year,\nand in all we had quite a successful\nday out.

The object\nwas to shoot 5 ten pin bowling\nskittles off a table as fast as\npossible. This was many people's first chance to try the big (.44) guns\nand much fun was had throughout\nthe afternoon. The winner was\nNathan with a time of approximately 15 seconds and if he\ncomes down to the range sometime\nhe can collect his prize of a double-edge sword.\nThis was the first of many fun\nshoots we hope to run which will\ninclude skate blasting, clay pigeon\nshooting (with a difference), more\nskit tle shooting and possibly even\na bug hunt (you know, bio mechanical alien monstrosities\nwith acid for blood). All events are\nheld in the rifle range which is in\nHockey\nHockey (Mens) 1st XI 0 Royal\nHolloway + Bedford 0\nThis was another of those games\nthat we should have won, but in the\nend were lucky not to lose. The most enjoyable aspect from a spectators point of view must surely\nhave been watching the captains\nhand grow in size!\nThe complex looked like a building\ndesigned by a mad architect. It\nconsisted of domes, ramps, walkways, glass passages and lifts\npiled up on top of each other with\nother pieces of construction rammed halfway into the mess.\nKerplunk before the marbles fall.\n' Come on in. The executives are\nwaiting for you.' They walked into the entrance\nand the guide pulled out an\nelectronic box.\n'What's that?'\n'It's an exec de tec, an executive\ndetector. Due to security reasons it\nis impossible to find anyone you\nwant in this building. The signs are\nmisleading and will only lead to\nconfusion and anyone you ask will\nbe subconsciously triggered to stare\nblankly at you, mumble something\nand walk off. The only way to find\nsomeone is by using this.'\nThe guide displayed the box to\nStress. A pretty pattern of buttons,\nembellished with logo glyph ics sat.\nunderneath a small circular radar\nscreen. The guide turned the box\naway, pressed a button and strode\noff down the corridor. They followed its maze like path until they\nreached the bottom of a spiral\nstaircase and ascended into the heart\nof the complex.\nThe staircase spiralled up among\nboxes, platforms, walkways and\ntubes that receded into the distance\nin all directions. Light filtered\nthrough the frosted glass of the\ndome and lit up the construction like\na submerged wreck. They continued travelling in this fashion\n' Uh, thanks.'\n'It's wonderful of you to visit us.'\n'Yeah, I wonder if you.'' And I'm sure you' ll be happy to\nhelp us with a good cause.'\n' Well, uh, certainly. What is it?'\n' We'd like to experiment on\nyou.' 'What!'\nsee our humanitarian, caring society\nwon't allow cruel experiments on\nits citizens. But you'll do fine!'\n'I'm human!'\n'If you were you wouldn't object\nto the self sacrifice and if you're not\nwe don't need your permission. Do what's required, Ps D LmC Q sT.' The guide grabbed Stress with his\nThe Inner System\nChapter 4: Revelation by Troy Tempest.\nfor a while, rising up above the\nmess via tunnels and stairs and\nbridges until they arrived at a small\ndoor. The guide knocked.\n' Come in.' They walked into a plush,\nwindow less office with un holstered leather chairs and a large oak desk.\nSitting behind it was a man of\nsimilar make to the guide, another\nmodel with greater mileage.\n'Welcome, visitor, to the central\ncomplex.'\nThe executive was wearing an\nenormous smile that extended right\nacross his face. Stress had visions\nof the edges meeting at the back and\nsevering his head.\n'Not very nice experiments but\nit's for a good cause.'\n'I don't think I...' Stress backed away from the\nexecutive and bumped into the\nguide.\n' You mean you don't want to\nhelp save lives?'\n'It's not that.'\n' You' d rather be selfish and\ncowardly and let others die to\nprotect yourself!'\n'But why me?'\n' Oh, well. You see you're not\nhuman. You may look pretty human\nbut we know you're just an\nunimportant creature. We're pretty\nlucky you turned up actually. You arms and the executive walked\ntowards him, holding a needle.\nNaval chemical induce rs in Stress's body, triggered by the panic\nsignals, suppressed the cerebral\nactivity and signalled a subconscious reaction mane ou vre. Stress snapped forward and down,\nsending the guide over his head to\ncrash into the executive. He grabbed the exec de tec off the desk\nbefore turning around and escaping\nout the door.\nAll articles in Felix remain the\ncopyright of the original\ncontributor.\n\n"

    "content": "1 November1991 Felix 915 Letters\nSelective questions distort sense\nDear Editor,\nRe. The College Day As chairman of the working party\nwhose report was discussed by the\nBoard of Studies on23 October,\nmay I correct some factual errors\nin the report in your issue of25 October?\n1. We( the working party) reminded\nthe board that 'last session student\nopinion was strongly opposed to an\nextension of teaching hours' (which\nshows that we were aware of the\nvarious referenda), but said that 'we\nknow of no systematic expression\nof students' views this session.'\nWe also wrote that 'students (and\nindeed staff) will need to be\nconsulted about the details of the\nimplementation'. Your selective\nquotations distort the sense of what\nwe wrote.\n2. The main reason for considering\nthe change was to make it easier for\ndepartments to arrange the choice\nof subjects that many students want\nand/or need. Last session, the board\nwas inclined to make the change,\nbut deferred a decision until it had\nthe best estimates that could be\nmade of the cost.\n3. The Managing Director, who\nassured us that the cost would be\n'next to nothing', is Angus Fraser;\nGordon Marshall is the Director of\nEstates.\n4. The board did not defer a decision until 11 December or any\nother date; it decided that the new\nhours will operate from October\n1992 (subject to various conditions\nstated in our report), and that each\nacademic department should consult\nits own students about the\nintroduction of the new hours.\nYours sincerely,\nS.A.V. Swanson.\nSome points are worth making\nconcerning the above letter.\n1. I'm glad you're 'aware' of\nthe various referenda. It rather\nbegs the question as to what the\npoint of such referenda are since\nthe College intends to ignore their\noutcome. Also, claims that you\nHAIRDRESSERS\n15A HARRINGTON ROAD,\nSOUTH KENSINGTON\n071-823 8968\nWe have a fantastic offer for all you\nstudents, a cut wash and blow dry by our top stylist\n(which normally costs around \u00a321)\nFor only \u00a311 Men \u00a312 Women\nCheck us out !\n'know of no systematic expression\nof students' views this session' are\nirrelevant. This makes no\ndifference to the meaning of the\nquote. Are you saying that despite\nknowing the views of last year's students, this year's students\nsuddenly think differently?\n2. Have all staff been\nconsulted? Have the trade\nunions? They will have to work\nlonger hours.\n3. True. Sorry, though I think\nthat commenting that Gordon\nMarshall is the Director of Estates\nrather than MD is rather petty.\nThe sentence may be ambiguous,\nbut it isn't wrong.\n4. True. This is a factual\ninaccuracy for which I apologise.\nIn our defence, we tried to\nconfirm the story with a number\nof people including the Union\nOffice none of whom were in. The\nstory was based on a slightly out\nof date document, but none of us\nare prescient so without\nindependent confirmation\nmistakes are made.\n\u2014Adam.\nSports centre\nDear Sirs.\nI am writing to you to draw your\nattention to events concerning the\nSports Centre over the past six\nmonths.\nFirstly the plans for the\nrebuilding of the Sports Centre and\nSouthside Gym were not made\navailable to the South Kensington\nSports Committee until the\narchitects had presented version 6,\ndespite the fact that the South\nKensington Sports Committee is the\nbody set up by the Governing Body\nin 1968 to be the management\ncommittee of the sporting facilities\nat South Kensington. The brief\ngiven to the architects by Valerie\nStraw still has not been made\navailable for discussion or comment\ndespite the fact that it is obviously\nof interest to the SK SC and\noriginally included the removal of the Rifle Range. This idea was only\nscrapped after I suggested that\nValerie Straw look at the college's obligations under the 1954 Landord\nand Tenant Act and the 1938\nDefence of the Realm Act.\nSecondly at the joint meeting of the college athletics committee and\nSouth Kensington Sports\nCommittee the architects plans were\nfinally shown and a great deal of disquiet shown to the proposed\nchanges. The reasoning behind\nthese changes, we were informed\nby Gordon Marshall, was 'to appeal\nto the middle-aged executive' and\nwhen I pointed out that the Sports\nCentre was for the students here, he\nsaid ' Oh, Iam sure they will like\nit as well'.\nBecause of a lack of time the\npaper tabled by Valerie Straw on\nnew admission charges and membership had only a brief airing.\nWhen I questioned the need for a 'membership' charge and that the\nrevenue gained thereby would be\nbetter and fairly raised by increasing existing charges using\nthe existing structure the only reply\nI got which could be considered as\nhaving the same argument as the\ncounter argument was 'well, I like\nit' (membership). When Harry\nKnutton ( C.A.C. chairman) decided\na meeting to discuss this\nmembership issue would be\nnecessary and would be called in\nSeptember, Gordon Marshall said\n'we are going to do it anyway'.\nI have written to the Rector twice\non the issue of 'membership' at the\nSports Centre and the only reply on\nwho is empowered to make such\ndecisions, Valerie Straw as facilities\nmanager or the Governing Body' s Committee, was that the college had\nnot yet broken the law.\nThe final straw of this saga is the\ncancellation of the joint CAC SK SC meeting on Monday28 th October\nby Valerie Straw to allow a complete rethink on the plans. I thought that it was the job of the\nsecretary, John Vandridge-Ames to\nconvene and cancel meetings not\nhers. It may be coincidence but\nanother architect, Mr Geoffrey\nDark es of Geoffrey Dark es Associates, a well respected and\naward winning practice, was due to\nhave his feasibility study and plans\ntabled at this meeting. This means\nthat when the final plans are decided\nupon there will be very little\ndiscussion because the deadline for\ncontracts etc is the end of December, if work is going to start\nin the summer of1992. Iam willing to make available\nboth architects plans and all other\ncorrespondence on this matter in my\npossession to any interested party.\nYours faithfully,\nNick Roy all, Non-Teaching Staff\nRep,\nSouth Kensington Sports\nCommittee.\n\u2014 19\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews Felix 915 1 November1991 Boyz 'n' The Hood Mannequin on the Move\nBoyz 'n* the Hood is the debut f dm written and directed by 23 year-old\ndirector John Singleton. Born and\nraised in the South Central Los\nAngeles ghettos, this also provides\nthe subject matter for the movie.\nThe film is based upon the coming\nof age of three boys subjected to the\ndrugs and violence that comes with\nthe territory, and the friendship that\ndevelops between them. The three\nboys are played by ex NWA rapper\nIce Cube. Morris Chestnut, and\nCuba Golding Jr as Tre, with Larry\nFishbourne, of Spike Lee's School\nDaze fame, as Tre's father.\nThis film is not an action movie\nabout rival crack warlords staging\ngangster shoot-outs in Compton alleys, nor is it a depressing three\nhour arty epic about life in the\nAmerican slums. The film is,\nmoreover, funny, real, entertaining\nand thought provoking. John\nSingleton demonstrates how racism\nworks in Western society and\nprovides some of the means and the\nhope to escape from the situation.\nOn the advertisements for this\nfilm you might see the slogan\n'Increase the Peace'; this is the real\nmessage intended.\nCutting through the bullshit this\nis quite possibly the best film you\ncould see this year. But don't take\nmy word for it; beg, borrow or steal\nthe money to get a ticket and see this\nfilm. Splendid.\nBob.\nAlthough seriously lacking in every\ndepartment, not least credibility,\nwith minimal character is ation and\na plot of such mawkish and\nsaccharine sentimentality that even\nSnow White would blanche, Mannequin on the Move was not\nentirely without hope.\nRedemption came from some\ndelightfully choreographed scenes\nreminiscent of the Marx Brothers at\ntheir best. The producers made a conscious decision to use unknowns\nin the lead parts and whilst this may\nbe commendable their rough edges\nrendered a very amateur finish to\nthe film.\nWhilst devoid of blood, gratuitous violence and virtually\neverything that makes films like\nTerminator the hits they are, this\nfilm will appeal to the hopelessly\nmoonstruck amongst you and good\nluck to you, and it. You' ll need it.\nMylan Lester.\nThe Reviews Editors wish to point\nout that this review does not\nrepresent the views of Felix or its\nstaff. Or, in fact, anyone else.\nThis film received one and a half\nlines in the Sunday Times. Barry\nNorman ignored it. Draw your\nown conclusions.\nEarl's Court Motorfair Street Asylum\nCars! Cars! Cars! Is that all there\nis ?\nIn fact, yes, that is all there is\n(apart from a bit about the BBC, some in- car stereo displays and\nLynn F auld s Wood from Watchdog) and that's what makes\nthe Motorfair such a bizarre idea.\nGranted, a car's the second biggest\npurchase most people will ever\nmake, but even so, it was quite\nterrifying to see the excess of\n(expensive) shiny metal and the\nincredibly sad visitors mingling in\nauto erotic fantasy. An average\nstand costs half a million pounds,\nwhich is probably why BMW chose\nnot to attend this year; they\nprobably felt it wasn't worth having\ngreasy boy racers and sandal led Enthusiasts clamber over their\nimmaculately shined v room v rooms. So what is there to say? After the\nfirst few hundred cars they all start\nto look rather similar (probably\nbecause they do anyway) and\nattention wanders irrevocably to the\ndisplays. Volvo had an upended\ncrash-car; Peugeot chose to flog\ntheir wares with some hideous\nMOR shite and drove me to the\nReliant Robins, where a shiny blue\nthree-wheeler tried, against the odds\nand the competition, to look like a superlative willy-substitute. No leggy blondes (except Lynn FauldsW ood, of course) this year;\npresumably they're reserved for\nphoto calls. All around there were\nsad people having the greatest\nmoment of their lives as they\nphotographed each other sitting in\nMercs; as they encountered the\nexcitement of Renault and drooled\nappreciatively at cars groin-high,\ntwenty feet long and with bulbous\nheads (hmm.. so what do you think,\nDr. Freud ?). As for green issues,\nforget 'em; all you get is (yes s s) Volvo and the Royal College of\nArt.\nThe show's not very interesting,\nthe cars are OK, most of the people\nare crap.\nThe Flying Gerbil\nAimed straight at the heart of the\nDirty Harry exploitation market this\nfilm is remarkable in the fact it isn't crap. It is poor but it isn't crap. Not\nvery crap anyway.\nWings Hauser as the good cop\nwho joins the elite Special Squad\nwho crack down on crime HARD!! This squad consists of people who\nlook like the bad guy extras in the\nA Team or MacGyver and who\npolish guns and spit and swear like\nwot real men do. Out on patrol the\nsensitive Wings notices his partner\nseems to be on the verge of\nhomicidal psychosis, twitching and\nsweating like a guinea pig in a microwave, when the guy appears\nto have ESP and they bust an\ninnocent looking apartment finding\na rapist and blowing the mother\naway. Unfortunately an innocent\ngardener also gets killed and that\nnight the partner 'commits suicide'.\nTwo points of interest!! ESP and\nmysterious suicide!! Not only is\nWings disturbed by the actions of\nthe others but also by his own\nincreasing violence and awareness.\nBeing a true genre video there are\na few gratuitous scenes of black\nleather female domination (whips\nand chains), unnecessary deaths,\nguns and knives appearing regularly\nand the reasons behind the mystery\ncoming directly from 1950's Sci-Fi.\nAll this said, there is a rather\ndisturbing right wing message\ncoming through this film. Granted,\nthe story is about a man against the\nscheme, but the message that the\nonly way to fight the increasing\ncrime is by extreme force is rather\nfrightening. The opening scenes\nshow avi de cam view from a car\nof a street and all the acts of violent\ncrime that they pass; murder,\nrobbery, bag snatching, fighting,\ndrug selling etc.\nThis film is the kind that is on\nT.V. late at night and is a bit too\ninteresting to turn off. Get a few\ncans in and sit and enjoy (if the\nvideo shop has nothing better).\nThe Amazing Machine\n\n"

This is the major forum for\nstudents policy at Imperial College\nUnion. It is held in the Concert Hall\nat 6pm, not as listed in the\nHandbook as the lounge (due to the\nlounge having a fire limit 50 below\nquorum\u2014hopefully this should be\nexplained at the meeting if you\ndon't understand). The sabbaticals\nand other officers give reports so if\nyou haven't seen a sabbatical yet\nand want to then the U GM is a pretty good bet. Other than reports\nwe have motions. These allow\nstudents to set policy and mandate\nthe officers to do some work. They\nare usually set out as three sections\n1) ICU Notes\u2014a list of facts\nconcerning the motion.\n2) ICU Believes, and\n3) ICU Instructs\u2014a list of actions\nto be carried out.\nFor example:\n1) ICU Notes \u2014 The Deputy President is small and annoying.\nWelfare Week Comedy Club. After\nall, what better way of feeling good\nto the depths of your soul than by\nhaving a right good laugh? The\nComedy Club features a whole load\nof acts, from experienced TV performers to nervous, gibbering\nwrecks who have never been on\nstage before in their lives. So you\nknow what that means\u2014turn up and\ngive 'em hell, kids. Doors open at\n9pm for a9.30 pm start\u2014it's in the\nUnion Lounge so seats are strictly\nlimited. Prices: \u00a33, \u00a31.50 to Ents\ncard holders. As usual, there's a late\nbar and disco.\nGraham Lawton, Ents Chairman2) ICU Believes\u2014The Deputy\nPresident should be a strapping six\nfoot 2 inches with dark hair, so that\nthe President can get off with him.\n3) ICU Instructs\u2014The Hon Sec\n(Events) as returning officer to\nendeavour to implement ICU Believes without breaking too many\nelection rules.\nThere is more to it, but that covers\nthe basics. Motions should be\nsubmitted to the Union Office by\n2.30pm on Wednesday afternoon.\nThey should be proposed and\nseconded by full members of the\nunion. Please bring your union card\nor registration slip to the UG M.On Friday night there is the\nSilwood Bonfire Party which costs\n\u00a34, and \u00a33 for the coach there and\nback. Tickets should be available\nfrom the Union Office by the time\nyou read this.\nThe following Saturday seems to\nbe another Rag Day with a Maidstone poppy day collection and\nLeukaemia Research Pub Crawl, check out today's Rag Meeting\n(12.40pm Union Lounge) for\ndetails from Penguin.\nFinally thanks to the CC Us for all\nthe free dinners last month and\nputting up with my crap jokes.\nApologies to all the people who\nturned up on Monday for the Blues\nNight, but the band didn't show due\nto circumstances beyond the control\nof the Hon Sec. I hope you enjoyed\nthe Sol promo though.\nSteve Farr ant,IC UH on Sec (Events)\nCollege Day As you will have seen from last\nweek's Felix article, the working\nparty on the college day submitted\nits final report to Board of Studies\nlast Wednesday. Although the\nreport contained no\nrecommendations, it did contain\ndetails of a framework for a day\nwhich involves starting at 9.00am, lunch at 12.00pm, finishing at\n6.00pm. Therefore the whole day\nwill be increased by one hour.\nAlong with the f ram work a set of\nguidelines were included which\neffectively prevented departments\nfrom increasing the workload by\nlimiting the number of contact hours\nin a day. It also recommended that\nthe longer day need not be taken by\nall departments, those which have\nno timetabling problems can choose\nto have a day running from 10 'til\n6 or from 9 'til 5. As was not\nreported last week (!?) the Board of\nStudies did actually pass the\nworking parties framework along\nwith the relevant guidelines.\nHowever, the agreement is that no\ndecision on timetabling can be made\nuntil the students in each department\nare consulted. That means that a staff student committee will be able\nto negotiate the method of use taken\nby each department.\nPostgraduates\nGuidelines for Research Students\nThere is a booklet written by\ncollege called 'Guidelines for\nresearch students' which contains\ndetails about your life at IC as a PhD student. It should have been\ngiven out when you first arrived but\nit seems there was a problem with\ndistribution. It is very useful as it\nUL U The University of London Union( UL U) has teams for most sports.\nIf you would like to represent the\nUniversity in a sport contact the\nUL U Sports Council.

The Police are still investigating the\nincident and Mr Briley told Felix\nthat he hoped peer pressure would\nbring the culprit forward. T would\nbe grateful for any information', he\nsaid.\nDaniel Shields, the treasurer of the\nSocial, Cultural and Amusements\nBoard ( SCAB), has resigned after\na dispute with the Union. SCAB is\none of the major sub-committees\n( MSC) of the Union, and the\nexecutive of each MSC must sign\na document in which they are held\nliable for fiscal losses incurred by\nthe MSC' s constituent clubs.\nWithout aS CAB treasurer, no\nSCAB society can buy equipment\nor deposit money. Some societies\nhave refused to give cash to the\nUnion until their banking pri vele ges are returned to them.

The warden, Dr Jan Bradley,\ntold Felix that she considered the\nmeals to be much better than last\nyear, although the students do not\nfeel that the improvement in quality\nmerits the 40 pence price increase\nimposed. The meals now cost\n\u00a32.95.\nThe warden said that students are\nnot able to opt out of the system if\nthey wish to eat a meal ouside the\nhall. They have no means of\nrecouping the money lost on these\nmeals, and their meal is cooked\nregardless. According to a recent\npoll in the hall, about 2 5 % of the\nfood is wasted during the term\nbecause of people not being there\nto eat it. The students have an\noption of taking a pack lunch with\nthem, but this option is only offered\non Wednesdays and Fridays. They would much rather be recompensed\nwith money.\nThe residents have sought redress\nfor this problem by sending\ncomplaints to College administration. Dr Bradley said that\nstudents 'are not getting terribly far\nwith the administration,' and\naccording to one student they have\n'contacted everyone possible.... and\nsent loads of letters,' but have been\ngiven the 'run-around'.\naffected include FilmS oc, Jazz and\nRock Club, the Orchestra, the\nOperatic Society, and the Dramatic\nSociety.\nMr Shields claimed that Union bureaucracy held back his role as\ntreasurer and during a heated SCAB meeting yesterday, both Mr. Shields and Jonathan Griffiths,\nUnion Deputy President, defended\ntheir positions. Zayeed A la am, SCAB chairman, hoped that Mr. Shields would act as treasurer until\na replacement could be found and\nthat he could be persuaded to\nwithdraw his resignation.\nZoe Hellinger, Union president,\nhas offered a compromise, in that\nMr Shields can write his own\ndeclaration and submit it for\napproval to the Union. Mr Griffiths\ntold Felix that he had not heard of\nthis, and that as all other MSC treasurers had signed it, why should\nMr Shields be different? Steve\nNewhouse, Chair of the Social\nClubs Committee ( S CC) told Felix\nthat he had not been asked to sign\nthe document, and nor had his\ntreasurer, Mark Randall.\nUnion\nGeneral\nMeeting\nOn Thursday 7th November there\nwill be aUG M( Union General\nMeeting) in the Union Concert\nHall. It has been moved from the\nEnts Lounge as this has a fire limit\nof 250 people, smaller than quorum\nfor aUG M. The Concert hall has\na limit of300 which allows a quo rate meeting.

    "content": "1 November1991 Felix 915 Reviews\nFlirting\nThis is John Duigon's second film\nin a trilogy that began in 1987 with\nThe Year My Voice Broke, I didn't see that but you won't be lost in this\nmovie, set in 1965 in fucking\nkangaroo land. Donny Em b lig( Noha Taylor) is in form five at a boy's boarding school. Like that\nDead Poets movie. However this is\nno soppy propagandist American shite film, this movie is on a higher\nplane.\nDonny has a slight stutter and a big gish nose\u2014so he pretty well\nqualifies as the butt of piss takes and\npranks. However, all those other\nkids are so wrong, for Donny is the\ncoolest motherfucker in the world\n(a bit unrealistically cool actually)\nand intelligent too but obviously not\nin the scientific sense. Across a river, staring across at the boy's school, is the girl's boarding\nschool; well, it had to be\nsomewhere. A new girl, Thordive\nAdjeua (Thordie Newton), the\ndaughter of an African nationalist\nacademic who is a visiting professor. Being black, she suffers\nsome racism but makes a couple of good friends. At a rugby match,\nDonny meets Thordive. Well, you know what, but that's only part of it. Although, this movie has no plot,\nit doesn't need one; it's well\ndirected, produced and acted. For a boarding school movie, I have to\nrate this one very highly, I know\ncinemas are now shit expensive, but\nif you can, see it.\nSo mi. Holy Terror\nThis is a handily sized semi-paperback which costs a bit too\nmuch and doesn't last quite long\nenough. It might have been better\nthe other way round.\nHoly Terror is the second of DC s Elseworlds series, which\nbegan with the interesting-idea-but-below-par Gotham By Gaslight.\nThe intention is to place DC characters in alternate histories and\nsee how they run. This one's about\nBatman in a world where the\nPuritans stayed in power after the\nRevolution and society is pinned by\nheresy, blasphemy and other words\nthat end in y. It's more or less an\norigin story in disguise, and the plot\nis fairly flimsy, most of its attraction\ncoming from novelty value and\nspot-the-cameo entertainment; the\nart's nothing special and you could\nsay the same about the book. I'd wait for Batman meets Bambi.\nThe Flying Gerbil Other People's Money Hunting of the Snark\nDanny DeVito is back and he's bad.\nIn a character cross between that of his role in Twins and War of the\nRoses he plays a doughnut loving,\nsex crazed, violin playing (?!!?),\nmoney loving, lawyer hating,\ndoughnut loving, doughnut loving,\ndoughnut....honestly he can't get\nenough of them good ol' dunkin'\ndoughnuts for breakfast, board\nmeeting, bedroom, ballroom (and\neverywhere else that begins with a'B'), he even sends flowers with the\nbloody things. Anyway where was\nI, oh yes, well basically he's a Wall\nStreet cowboy, rude, crude yet\nundeniably brilliant, rescuing dying\ncompanies and carting them off to\nslaughter. All for enormous profit,\nbut mainly for fun.\nThe film centres around his sights\non snapping up a debt free, 81 year\nold New England Wire& Cable\nCompany. For' Larry the\nLiquidator'. It's the perfect target,\npiece of cake (or should that be\ndoughnut?), but this is one he's going to have to fight for.\nI had very mixed feelings about\nthis movie, as did most who saw it.\nIt starts like a second rate slot on\nan Imperial College comedy night,\nwith Danny boy coming out with so\nmany one-liners, bloody corny ones\ntoo, that the film looks desperate for\nlaughs. I'm glad to say, however,\nthat it does improve immensely in\nthe middle with the ending being\nboth completely unpredictable (I mean, how did they come up with\nair cushions?) and very original.\nThere's a hell of a lot crammed\ninto this film, with love rearing its\nugly head, soppy, tear jerking bits\naplenty, laughs by the lorry full,\nand an excellent supporting cast,\nnamely Gregory Peck, Penelope\nAnn Miller, Piper Laurie and De a Jones. It's worth seeing, but not\nworth wetting yourself over. This\nmust be Danny at his finest. It opens\nat the Cannon, Shaftesbury Avenue\non 15th November. Be there or be\na doughnut.\nPoo.\nEver since Lewis Carroll put pen to\npaper and wrote The Hunting of the\nSnark and then refused to explain\nwhat it meant, if anything, it has\nremained one of the greatest\n'nonsense' writings. Mike Batt'sdram at is ation of the poem is as\ngreat a piece of theatre as the poem\nwas of writing. The story concerns\nan eclectic group of\" 19th century\nstereotypes sailing away to find a Snark.

    "content": "Letters Felix 915 1 November1991 Quit\nBiackett Is there anyone\nblackened there?\nDear Adam,\nConcerning the Physics Department's smoking policy, revised at the beginning of this year.\nBefore I start a torrent of abuse\nfrom poor, oppressed smokers and\nfrom other students who believe\nthey have a right to avoid passive\nsmoking, let me say that (a) I smoke, (b)I agree that no one\nshould have to inhale my secondhand smoke.\nIt used to be the case (last year)\nthat all of Biackett was non-smoking\napart from one of the two common rooms (and I use this term in a fairly\nbroad sense\u2014it was a room with\none table, some padded chairs and\nashtrays). But it served the purpose;\nyou could cut the atmosphere in\nthere with a chainsaw but with the\nexception of one or two blind and\ndeaf individuals who couldn't see\nthe signs, no one smoked anywhere\nelse and so all the smoke remained\nin a confined area. If you didn't want to passively smoke you just\ndidn't go down there.\nOver the summer, word processors were installed down\nthere\u2014a valuable facility, useful to\nall students and not one which the\ndepartment wishes to have fag ash\nsprayed over. Perfectly reasonable,\nthen, to move the smoking area. It\nis now in the foyer on level 2, a completely open-plan area which\neveryone must walk past to get to\ntheir common room. The smoke\nDear Adam,\nIs there any intelligent life out\nthere?\nI am not talking about the\nuniverse as a whole, but IC in\ngeneral. As you know, one of your\nlead stories (Super Plug: Issue 914)\nwas false. Well, I knew it was\nbecause I helped create it, but was\nFelix inundated with complaints,\nqueries or requests for patent\ndetails, no!\nThis didn't surprise me because\nI thought IC as a whole had seen\nthrough this blatant journalistic\nruse. However, during the last few\ndays I have found more people who\nhave been taken in by it.\nI can only draw two conclusions\nfrom this: Everybody in college has\nforgotten their ' O' Level Physics or\nthat people blindly believe everything they read in print. I honestly don't know which of these\nis more worrying, a complete\nbreakdown of secondary school\nscience teaching or the jaded minds\nnow drifts all over the place.\nSmoking may be out of fashion\nand we may be in a minority, but\ntrying to eradicate it by stopping\npeople smoking in Biackett is not\nreally going to work.\nIn their defence, I will say that I haven'ta clue where else a smoking\nthat don't think about what they\nread.\nFelix is never 100% accurate\n(sorry Adam the truth is out), but\nneither is any other newspaper,\njournal or similar publication. News\nand research can be biased by\nopinions or just plain wrong and\nshould always be approached with\nhealthy scepticism.\nMany graduates from IC will\neither do research or take up jobs\nwhere the assessment of written\nreports is a crucial part of the\ndecision making process. Considering the number of people\nfooled by a story made up in thirty\nminutes, what hope have they of\nspotting a deliberate scientific hoax\nwhen one next comes along?\nYours sincerely,\nSteven Newhouse.\nP.S. Who would believe that an\nElectrical Engineering graduate\ncould look like Alec Baldwin\nanyway?\narea could go in Biackett, but we\nare now only one step away from\nshoving every smoker out onto\nPrince Consort Road for a quick fag\nbetween lectures. I suppose it is a nice, big open space.\nYours,\nPaul Davison, Physics 2.\nDear Editor,\nWhy is nothing at the QT priced?\nIs it asking too much to know how\nmuch we will be asked to pay. The\nonly items priced are the\nsandwiches and hot foods. Why are\nthere not prices for the large range\nof crisps, nuts, flapjacks and\nconfectionery?\nI am not suggesting that every\nitem should have a price tag, just\nthe boxes that the products are\npresented in.\nI presently purchase quite\nfrequently from the QT, but this\nlack of pricing is getting to me. I think that in future I will purchase\nless flapjacks, crisps and drinks\nthan I do at present, since I feel that\nthe price that I pay at the till varies\nfrom day to day.\nThe union image has certainly\nimproved over the last year or\ntwo\u2014especially the bookshop and\nQT. The improved service provided\nis very much appreciated\u2014could\nthis improvement be extended to\npricing the products you expect us\nto pay for.\nYours,\nDave Amin.\nThe Union doesn't run the QT\nsnack bar. Thus the reason for no\nprices is because College wants to\npull a fast one on you again.\nLegally all items should have a price on them or there should be\ndisplayed a price list with a description of the item and its\nprice. The item should be easy to\nidentify from the price list.\n\u2014Adam.\nInvent a The Hub Office\ninvites you to\ninvent a toy.\nThis term at IC you have three Big Chances. To Make a Child Happier. To Make a Mark at IC.\nTo Make some money when you\nneed it most.\nHow to do it? Enter the IC\nChristmas competition to invent,\nmake, create a toy. Entries are\naccepted in two categories: funny\nor serious. The First is for a toy that\nwill make a child laugh or purr with\npleasure. The Second is for a toy\nthat will demonstrate how some part\nof the universe works\u2014that's right\u2014a scientific principle. There\nis a prize of \u00a3200 for each category.\nThe toy must be a finished object,\nrobust enough for demonstration at\nthe Christmas Caper and in local\nprimary schools in the Pimlico\nproject by IC students on\nWednesday afternoons next term.\nAnyone who needs access to\nworkshop facilities can contact\nChris Gerrard on Ext 6122. He's at\nthe student's workshop where the\nmodel club meets on Tuesday\nevening.\nEntries must be submitted by\nThursday 28 November, 6pm at the\nHub Office, Sherfield, or by\nmidnight to the messenger desk on\nS her field Ground Floor. All students and staff are eligible to\nenter as an individual or as a group.\nJudging will take place at the\nChristmas Caper on Sunday afternoon December 1st in the\nConsort Gallery. Entrants must\nattend to watch children test drive\nthe toys and to answer questions\nthat the judges may ask. The judges\nwill be Professor Richard Gregory,\nFounder and Director of the Bristol\nExploratory, Professor Helen Haste\nof Bath University, a toy\nmanufacturer and, weather\npermitting, our alumni announcer,\nBreakfast Time's Frances Wilson.\nYou could make money even if\nyou don't win because all the\ncompetition entries will be exhibited\nthe first week in December in\nSherfield and may be priced for\nsale. In any case you'll have a personal critique with one of the\ncountry's leading lateral thinkers\nand the director of an internationally\nfamous toy maker.\ntoy\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs & Societies Felix 915 1 November1991 Footballing Heroes\nOn Sunday October27 th, Imperial College Association Football Club fielded two sides in\nthe U LU6a side tournament at\nMotspur Park. They got off to an\nelectrifying start with Stuart Watson\nplaying some good football down\nthe line - the express training really\nshowed!\nThe 1st team took a little time in\ngetting accustomed to the 6-a side\ntactics, and went down 3-0 in their\nfirst game against the Royal Free\nHospital. However all hope was not\nlost since the qualifying groups\nwere the best of three matches. So\nagainst Middlesex, the performance\nimproved, with a hammering 4-0\nwin. A fine header from Watson\nopened the scoring, with additional\ngoals from Telis Boltioz, Ruban\nRanachandran and Marv Ab do. Paul Nelson can feel unlucky about\nnot getting on the score sheet after\nhis header was saved on the line by\nthe opposing centre-back. The resulting penalty was taken by\nNelson himself, and although the\ndivot was unstoppable as it rocketed\ninto the top corner, the ball\nunfortunately proved a formality for\nthe Middlesex keeper.\nThe final group match for the\nl st's was against St Georges and\nwas won 2-1 by Imperial, both\ngoals coming from Ab do, who\nreally shone as the low sun caught\nhis forehead. Merciful Martin\nAtherton tried very hard to bring St\nGeorges back into the game by\nthrowing the ball into his own net,\nbut to no avail.\nThe 2nd's had a more convincing\nstart to their group, beating Charing\nCross easily 2-0, with fine goals\nfrom Chris Collison followed by a gem of a dig by new boy Richie\nDixon, who had a brilliant day in\nmidfield. (The message is - mind\nout!) New College (the eventual\nwinners) provided stiffer opposition\nand the 2nd's were narrowly beaten\n1 -0 due to a Rax Muthoo error and\nsome blistering New College pace.\nHowever the 2nd's secured their\nplace in the knockout stages by\nstuffing SO AS20, with Collison\ngetting his second for the day and\none from Andy Stanniland.\nSo onto the quarter-finals with the\nl st's playing Baits. A very tight\ncontest settled by a single goal from\nan even tighter player, Annan\nGalloway, who finally opened his\naccount. All credit to Watson who\ngot tired towards the end. The 2nd's quarter-final was a thriller against\nGoldsmiths, with Stanniland getting\na timely goal with Muthoo also\ntroubling the scorers. A great deal\nof praise should go to Steve\nShilling, who made hundreds of\nmatch winning saves to secure the\n2nd's semi-final place.\nIn the semi-final Imperial l st's played New College who had\npreviously beaten our 2nd's10 in\nthe qualifying stages. By this time\nfitness was telling and the New\nCollege extra pace and organisation\nensured a20 lead. Imperial were\nunlucky not to get one back as\nGalloway thumped the cross bar\nand Tom Robson was really\nsmokin', but sadly things didn't go\nour way, and the game ended 2-0\nto New College.\nThe 2nd's semi-final against UCL was a real nail-biter as we took the\nlead from a Collison penalty,\nhowever a Muthoo error allowed\nUCL back into the game. It then\ntook another fine performance by\nShilling to keep the scores level\nuntil full time. The game went\nstraight to penalties which was a thrilling contest, and eventually\ngoing UCL' s way 6 - 5 . Our sympathy goes out to Willie John\nMcKnight who missed the deciding\npenalty but had proved to be a good\n6-a side tact it i one r previously that\nday.\nThe U LU6a side tournament\nwas a great success for Imperial\nwho can take much pride in getting\nboth their sides to the semi-finals,\nand providing some great football\non the way. We all learned a lot\nfrom the day, in particular that\nE amman McCann and Phil Caldwell run funny, and that the\nKhyber Pass is between Afghanistan and Pakistan; in fact\nthe only unanswered question is\nhow can Galloway be so ugly when\nthe rest of his family are not? We need n't toss a coin to acknowledge\nShilling as IC's most important\nplayer, although everybody played\nextremely well, and have given the\nrest of the league a lot to think about\nwhen they play us this year. Marv Ab do and Ra x Muth oo, the\nrespective 1st and 2nd team\ncaptains, must be very confident\nabout the forthcoming season.\nTalkback\nWell after much grovelling, I finally\npersuaded Adam to give me a column of my own, to express my\nown views on life, and fill your\nminds with more interesting drivel.\nHopefully, this may become a regular item in the Clubs and\nSocieties pages, allowing me to let\noff steam.\nOK, for starters, last Monday, there was I, sitting in the Felix\noffice, hoping someone would walk\nin and place something in either of\nthe 'Sports Results' or the 'Clubs\nand Societies' pigeon holes. Getting\nrather fed up by the lack of input,\nespecially by the ACC clubs, I ambled back to my own room, and\nwrote out a letter directed towards\nthese clubs. However by the time\nI had mailed all the letters, my\ntelepathic thoughts seemed to have\nhad the desired effect, with a deluge\nof results and reports being handed\nin.\nSo, if you received a letter, but\nhave handed me some info, then\nignore it. Otherwise, if you are the\ncaptain/chairman/commodore/se-c ret ary of a club, then please try to\nlet me know of any forthcoming\nevents or the results from previous\nweeks. This is after all the magazine\nfor Imperial students, and it would\nbe nice if we could report on the\nhappenings of clubs affiliated to\nImperial. And furthermore, this is\nthe fastest, cheapest and easiest\nmethod of getting a message\nthrough to a large audience\n(membership).\nSometime in the future, I would\nlike to bring back the results table\nthat (for those who remember) used\nto be a regular feature a few years\nback. This would involve all the\nteams from each ACC club submitting their individual results,\npreferably before Monday lunchtime (that's12.301.30pm folks, if you've forgotten). No detailed report is necessary,\nalthough this may be a good idea for\na major event such as U AU matches. And a favourable result\nneed not be the only occasion that\na result be submitted. However, if\nthe response of the rugby captain is\nanything to go by, (several invisible\npromised submissions still\nforgetting huh?) this may be a long\nterm prospect, rather than one\nhappening very soon.\nFelix has at its disposal, several\nphotographers, who are very\nwilling to accompany Clubs to any\nevent. So, if you require photographs for any occasion,\nplease get in touch with either\nmyself or Adam, and we'll see if a photographer is available to tag\nalong. This also spices up the rather\ndrab look of the recent Clubs pages,\nwhich have been rather sparse of\nphotos.\nWith the end of the first month\nof term, and the beginning of\nNovember, it seems that these pages\nhave mainly been aimed by Clubs\nto advertise for greater\nmembership, especially among the\nfemale population. Certainly activities such as shooting, ten pin\nbowling and snooker require no\nextra physical ability - so come on\ngirls, get your act together and join\nin. These Clubs are there for\nYOUR benefit, to enable YOU to\nenjoy yourselves and relieve the\ntension from all those lectures and\ncourse work.\nIf you have any comments about\nthis, or any other issue regarding\nthe clubs and societies of Imperial,\nthen please don't hesitate to write\nto me or Adam, and we'll print the\nmore eloquent letters. Finally, with\nEngland playing Australia in the\nRugby WorldCup final this\nweekend, I'd like to wish the lads\nall the best, and hope they hammer\nthe Aussies.\nK hur rumS air, Sports Editor. "

    "content": "1 November1991 Felix 915 Feature\nTwo weeks. It's now only two\nweeks. Only two weeks until\ncollege is plunged deep into chaos,\nwith the long awaited arrival of Rag\nWeek.\nSeeing as there is a good chance\nthat you probably don't know what\nall of the events are, even if you\nhave been here for more than a year, I 'll give you a quick run\ndown. To start with, you must\nrealise that because it's Rag Week\nnone of the events are named very\nwell, maybe that's something to\nalter for next year. Regardless, find\nout what they are. Don't just rely\non the name, you could miss out on\na storming event. Anyway the\nlargest events are as follows:\n\u2022 Friday 15th Guilds Carnival. As a kick off to Rag Week we couldn't really do better than this. Taking\nover the Union Building in a manner similar to that at the end of\nFreshers' Week, the Carnival promises to be huge this year. It'sn of really a carnival, it's an event.\nLive bands, casino and disco. It's going to be big.\n\u2022 Monday18 th Mines Dirty\nDisco. The less you wear, the less\nyou pay to get in. And yes quite a few get in for free. However it is\nup to you. If just wearing a tie to\na disco isn't your thing, then wear\nthe whole suit. At the end of the day\nthe choice is yours, but make sure\nyou come along as it's always a great laugh.\n\u2022 Wednesday 20th RCS Beer\nFestival. This event is self\nexplanatory. Loads of people come\ninto the Junior Common Room( JCR) in Sherfield and drink loads\nof different beers. It's the largest\nnon CAM RA beer festival in\nBritain and it's deliberately on\nWednesday so everyone can spend\nall afternoon and most of the\nevening drinking. You' ll have to\nbuy the beer glass with this year's logo on and it'll also be your first\nchance to buy one of this year's Rag\nMags, they're great. Turn up, if not\nto buy beer then to buy a Rag Mag. \u2022 Thursday21 st Hypnosis Lecture. It's amazing. Every year\nwe pack the Great Hall( it's the\nbiggest room we can find). If\nyou've been before you'll know to\ncome again, if not come because\nthere's nothing like it. Again, it'sn of really a lecture, it's a Hypnosis\nShow. It's a show in two halves (so\nyou can grab a quick pint from the\nUnion in the middle). Firstly,\nRock Soc, Dramatic Soc and\nOperatic Soc as well as cabaret and\nnovelty acts from other keen\nparticipants. It's an excellent\nevening, really enjoyable and well\nworth going to.\nThis isn't all that's happening\nduring Rag Week. On Saturday it's the giant Rag Raid and on Sunday,\nthe hopeful trolley race around\nHyde Park( still awaiting to do a sponsored something, come\nto the Rag meeting today in the\nUnion lounge at 12.40pm and we'll\nauthor is.; you a sponsorship form.\nThis includes the SNK PJ( see\nabove).\nAs it's now only two weeks\naway, we arc obviously getting\nfrantic. Any help that you can give\nwould be greatly appreciated, be it\nfrom manning a door at a major\nTwo Weeks To Go\nMartin S Taylor, a professional\nhypnotist, gives a humorous talk on\nhypnosis in general, then in the\nsecond half demonstrates just what\nhe's been on about.\n\u2022 Friday 22nd The Smoking\nConcert Cabaret. We just couldn't close Rag Week with an event better\nthan this. It's a refined combination\nof the best that IC students have to\noffer. Including acts from Jazz and\npermission); on Tuesday it's the\nSlave Auction, the Charity Auction\nand Bar Quiz and on the Saturday\nafter it's the Sponsored Nude\nKamikaze Parachute Jump. If you\ndon't know what this is yet, find out\nby phoning 3402 and ask for\nGordon. There are already a great\nnumber of people doing sponsored\nevents during the week and if you\nsee them, sponsor them. If you want\nevent or just helping with the\nstupidities. Just give your name and\ndept to your Soc Rep, Hall Rep or\nput a note in my pigeon hole in the\nUnion Office. So now's the time to\nBe Mad, Be Silly & Be Part of It!\nCheers, Penguin( Marc Ellis), Rag Chair91/92. Last weekend saw ICU Rag raise\nanother thousand pounds or greater\nfor charity, as was managed in the\nthree weekends previously. The\namount raised, \u00a31,330.76 came\nfrom two independent collections.\nThe first was on Friday afternoon\nwhen students from IC headed off\ninto the prosperous part of the city\non the City of London Pub Crawl. It was shown that the decision to\ncollect from the city's business\ncommunity in the afternoon was a wise one, when at the end of the day\n\u00a3655.72 had been raised for\nUNICEF, the United Nations\nChildren's Fund. The day's top\ncollector was Tamsin Braisher who\nraised \u00a3270.78. Her collecting\npartner, Stuart Rison, attributed this\nto 'the rich businessmen putting the\nmoney in her Rag Can instead of\nmine saying that they'd rather give\nit to the girl with the nice legs!'\nThe second collection was on\nSunday, when students, all in fancy\ndress, went amongst the bus kers in\nCovent Garden Market and raised\n\u00a3675.04 for ICU Rag's chosen\ncharities. This year these charities,\nwho also benefit from the money\nraised during Rag Week, include\nMultiple Sclerosis, BIBI C, WWF, Turning Point and a selection of\nLocal Charities.\nThese two collections were then\nadded to by the \u00a383.53 brought\nback by a team of three selling old\nRag Mags while on a week's tour\nof Britain's other universities. This\ntakes the weekend total to an\namazing \u00a31,413.87, making the\noverall total for the year so far a staggering \u00a314,146.64. Last year\nRag raised in the region of \u00a332,400.\nThere are three more major\ncollections before Rag Week:\nAnother collection at Covent Garden on Sunday; a Poppy Day\ncollection in Maidstone next\nSaturday and a Leukaemia Research\nPub Crawl on the same afternoon\nand evening. This means that\nreaching half of last year's total\nbefore Rag Week starts is a very\nrealistic target.\nThis year Rag is very big and\nloads of fun. So get involved now\nand give them a hand on one of their\ncollections, especially the Pub\nCrawl. Peter Tau bunt. \u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"
