After\nweeks of failed negotiations Imperial\nCollege High Command (ICHC) ordered\na full-scale attack on the Terrace building.\nThe attack was only called off 47mins before the appointed time when Dr G of\nSheep Main wrote a letter to the chief\nhigh commander of ICHC, agreeing to let\nICHC inspectors onto the 5th floor of\nthe Terrace building.\nICHC believes that the 5th floor may\nhouse documents that could be used in\nan anti-ICHC manner. There have been\nrepeated reports from undercover ICHC\noperatives working inside Sheep Main\nthat a group is being formed with the\nintention of taking control of Imperial.\nICHC believe that this group is under\nthe control of Dr Pratt, part-time Sheep\nMain lecturer, part-time ego maniac. Dr Pratt has for a long time been of\nconcern to ICHC; he has been trying to\nraise his profile within the college\nthrough a series of propaganda cam-pa ign s. Although these have been largely\nunsuccessful, he has gained a small\ngroup of hardcore followers, albeit ones\non Dr Pratt's payroll.\nOn 29 December last year Dr Pratt\ntried to take control of the Maths depart-ment, to bring it under Sheep Main High\nCommand (SMHC) jurisdiction. Taking\nadvantage of the lax security over Winterval, he launched the Sheep Main 1st and 4th tank regiments against the Huxley building at 2am and succeeded in taking control of the lower two floors.\nICHC quickly launched air strikes\nagainst the Terrace building, cutting off\nsupplies to Dr Pratt's front line and forcing him to surrender. Under the terms of\nthe surrender Sheep Main should have\nallowed ICHC inspectors access to the 5th floor so that it could make sure Sheep\nMain was not withholding any patent\nthat could be used by ICI IC to fund Imperial's activities.\nDr G and the head of department,\nboth oppose this since, they argue, ICHC\nalready controls 90% of Sheep Main's academic activity, and thus should not need\nmore access. They say the real reason for\nthe demands is to undermine Sheep\nMain's command structure, with the eventual objective being the removal of the\npresent SMHC and their replacement by\na puppet command controlled by ICHC.\nf hey also denied any association with Dr\nPratt and said they were going to \"kick his\nhead in\" that afternoon.\nICHC say that their only concern is\nthe well-being of college and all its mem-be rs, pointing out that Sheep Main has\nrepeatedly flaunted college rules by taking over smaller departments unable to\ndefend themselves and several times\nbreaching interdepartmental rules.\nSheep Main's reply to this is that\nthey have only taken over departments\nthat are academically related and arc\nthus able to benefit from a merger. And\nthe only rules that they have broken arc\nones set down by ICHC with the express\npurpose of advancing ICHC's command\nover the academic departments.\nOther departments are split over the\nissue. Some of the bigger departments\nhave moved away from the official college line to defend SMHC's stance; perhaps fearful of their own position should\nICHC become too powerful. Most depart-ment s, in particular the smaller ones,\nhave backed ICHC and offered military\nassistance should il be necessary.\nIt seems that for now the threat of\nmilitary action has gone, but only time\nwill show whether it will return. ICHC\nwill remain wary of Dr Pratt and his activities, while Sheep Main will continue to\nresist ICHC intervention.\nDerek Found in West London\nBy Ross Newell\nA new area of London was discovered on\nTuesday. The new area, situated between\nChelsea and Westminster, is thought\nnever to have been walked on by a human foot. It had previously been\nblocked from view by a large wall. I low-ever the wall was knocked down last\nweek in order to build a new car park,\nand behind it the new land was disco v ered. The land, provisionally called Derek,\ncovers about 4,000 hectares. Gynaecologists believe this area may contain prehistoric flora and fauna that has not been\nseen since before modern man. There is\neven speculation this area may contain\ndinosaurs. The authorities have already\nissued warnings not to enter Derek until\nmore is known about the indigenous\nwildlife.\nA team of Britain's finest Gynaecologists and some foreigners are being\nprepared to en tet the region to do some\nserious scientific stuff. While the team is\ninside they will perform a thorough study\nof all the wildlife found.\nThe lead member of the expedition\nwas going to be Dr G of Sheep Main, but\nunfortunately he was called away to save\ntwenty astronauts in orbit around Jupiter\nfrom asphyxiation using only a Spitfire\nplane and a Sony Walkman. Instead Dr\nPratt elected himself leader of the group.\nSuggestions were made that the wall\nshould be rebuilt while Dr Pratt is inside,\nhowever this proposal was rejected on\nthe grounds that there would be no one\nleft to kick in the head if one was piss*d off.\nDerek is currently covered in jungle\nand thus almost impenetrable. Heavy\ncutting equipment has been moved in to\ntry and clear a path through the area so\nthat experts can study it in a pristine\nstate. The team of gynaecologist s will set\nup base camp just outside the Houses of\nParliament and enter the area in groups\nof three, each equipped with provisions\nto last at least three days, as well as a specimen bag, walk ie talk ie, shovel,\nmachete, and a five person camera crew\ncomplete with 500kg of gear.\nThe groups will move rapidly towards\nthe centre of the area to set up a Princess\nDiana memorial that can be used to raise\nmoney to fund the rest of the expedition.\nOnce the memorial is in place they will\nstart by making a basic geographical survey of the area to establish whether\nthere are oil deposits for their sponsors\nto exploit.\nOnce the preliminary preparations\nhave been completed the group will\nstart on the main purpose of the expedition, to study the fauna and flora in this\nuntouched area of great scientific value.\nDerek will be split into 4 sections, with\neach section studied by separate team.\nDr Pratt will command the operation\nfrom outside Derek to avoid dangerous\nanimals, fie will enter Derek only to be\nat the scene of any major discoveries\nattended by a TV crew.\nOn such occasions he will explain at\nlength how he found the discovery and\nwill go on to explain how this proves any\nand every theory that he has ever\nthought up including; Dr Pratt's theory of\nrelativity, evolution, the uncertainty principle and Christianity. He will finish up by\nexplaining what a wonderful person he\nis and how the world would fall apart if\nit weren't for his continued presence. He\nwill then have his head kicked in by the\nproducer of the TV crew.\nThe research team will be given two\nweeks to make a thorough study of the\narea before it is burnt and cleared to\nmake way for commercial developments.\nThe government is discussing what to do\nwith the land with several major international firms hoping to build a Princess\nDiana industrial estate. The sale of the\nland will raise over ElOOmillion for the\ntreasury.\nAn eight part documentary following\nthe exploration of the area will be\nscreened over the next few weeks. The\ndocumentary could follow the trials and\ntribulations of the group as they battle\nwith the difficult scientific task that they\nhave been given. It may show the battle\nagainst the authorities in an attempt to\ngain more funding and time, but is more\nlikely to focus on the divorces of a pair\nof scientists who were found in close\ncontact during an excursion into Derek.\n\n"

    "content": "10 Columns 16 December 1998\nFishy Finances\nT ime flies by when you're the driver\nof a train or, for that matter, a humble word smith. Without so much\nas a by-your-leave, Christmas is upon us,\nwhich means a couple of weeks holiday\nfor you lot. I 'll try to get out of the lab for\nten minutes to watch Her Majesty's address and have a sherry and mince pie,\nso remember those less fortunate etc. All\nin all, it has been a fairly busy term, with\nthe usual melange of triumphs, cock-ups and outrages. The BMS was opened,\nbut not finished, and is undoubtedly a major asset to the College. Not sure\nabout the heavy duty plaster work, capable of withstanding everything save for\nBlutak and paper, now you mention it.\nWe've had more elections than Italy, less\nconsultation of the populace than North\nKorea and as much petty bureaucracy as\nBrussels. Another typical chapter in the\nGreat Imperial Story.\nLast week's Felix raised a few interesting points, though whether Suzanne\nAgrain's letter falls into that category is\nnot for me to say. I shall limit myself to\nsaying that some of the figures I quoted\nfrom the World Bank were taken from\nUN sources, undermining her point, but\nsince this has all the hallmarks of a very\ntedious slang ing match, I shall say no\nmore, assured in the knowledge that I am right and she's wrong. That's quashed that one, eh Simon? Much\nmore worrying is the news that the STA\nAccademic travel agency is being\nreplaced. I have no particular loyalty to\nthe incumbents, though it would be\ninteresting to know why they were\ndeemed unsuitable to continue. The\nconcern stems from the Union's isolation\nfrom the whole episode. Given ICU's financial dependence on this outlet, this\nis worrying, particularly the fact that the\nUnion Manager was denied access to\nimportant paperwork associated with the\nmatter.\nA less charitable soul than myself\nwould suggest that the smell of Siberian\nhamster was on the breeze. Exclusion of\nsabbaticals, because they're just stu-dents, is understandable if one considers the Sherfield mindset. Don't get me\nwrong, it's disgraceful and hypocritical,\nwhen we consider how superbly they\nmanage their affairs, but I have a nasty\nsuspicion that marginal is ation of ICU is\nnot the College's main aim. It seems\nmore like an attempt to claw back JCR\nrefurbishment money denied, quite\nrightly, by the Union at the time. In other\nwords, the chances of the Union's share\nof the rent being the same after this deal\nare slim to zero. The time and effort\nwasted on this trifling issue at the highest level in Sherfield is laughable. The JCR\nfunding is and always was a matter for\nthe College; if one extended the ludicrous principle, wo uf d ICU be expected\nto pay for refurbishment of the Great\nHall, given that it is used at times by stu-dents? The provider of travel services at\nImperial is irrelevant as long as the service is competitive and reliable, but this\nall looks a bit fishy. I hope I am proved\nwrong, but don't hold your breath.\nHealth Centre Disgrace\nW hen I joined Imperial shortly\nafter the War, I resolved to register with the Health Centre.\nHowever, since I bother the medical profession as often as your average turkey\ninvites Bernard Matthews round for\nmince pies, I have still yet to fill in the\nforms. However, I recently heard mum-bling s in the SCR about the cessation of\na full service on a Tuesday afternoon.\nWere you\naware of this?\nDid anyone\ntell you? Of\ncourse not,\nyou're only\nstudents/\nstaff/First Aid\ncoord in a tors/Heads of\nDepartment. I first heard of\nit because of\na fairly serious\naccident in\nBiochemistry,\nwhich was\nunnecessarily\ndelayed by\nconfusion\nover a new\npolicy that\nnobody outside the\nHealth Centre\nappeared to have heard of. This in itself\nis disgraceful. In an organisation such as\nImperial, where the smallest detail has to\nbe dissected by an endless stream of\ncommittees and steering groups, it\nseems inconceivable that such a vitally\nimportant policy change can go through\nwith seemingly no recourse to anyone\nelse in College. So, you ask, how do the\noverburdened people in the Health Centre want to use the time made available\nby this alteration? Health education? Nonemergency treatment, such as the provision of im munis at ions for foreign\ntravel? Don't be daft. Administration and\nmeetings. We now have a substandard,\nill-defined medical service on Tuesday\nafternoons in order that they can push\npaper around. This is an intolerable sit-u ation, which calls into question the usually sound judgement of those involved.\nThe correct solution has three stages.\nFirstly, don't have an accident on Tuesday afternoons. Secondly, inform all the\nrelevant people of the exact procedures,\nso delays are avoided when dealing with\ncasualties, finally, scrap this stupid idea\nand get back to running a proper service,\nfor which a huge amount of money has\nbeen spent in the last lew years. With\nrumours about the withdrawal of certain services provided for College staff,\nit is time people on this side of Exhibition\nRoad took a look at those on the other.\nLeave the Lords Alone\nIt may have escaped your notice, but\nthis has not been a good few weeks\nfor the Conservative Party. Things\nwere going so well, and then we had the\nCranbornc incident, to cut a long story\nshort, the Government was offered a compromise involving the retention of\nninety-one hereditary peers until the\nmystical Stage\nSimon Baker exchange for\nan agreement\nnot to scupper\nLabour's whole legislative pro-gram me. Viscount Cranborne made a number of\nerrors, both in\nhis suggestion\nand approach,\nfor which he\nwas rightly crit-ici sed. As for\nsacking,\nWilliam Hague\nwas in the\nperfect catch-22. His only\nreal failing\nwas bringing\nup the whole subject, rather than continuing the attack on Europe. I imagine\nhe may do things differently if history\nrepeats itself.\nLord Cranborne's offer was far too\ngenerous. The Conservative peers would\nnever stall all of the Government's leg-isla tion, since it would breach the Salisbury Convention, which prevents the\nobstruction by the Upper House of a manifesto-pledged bill. Secondly, his\ncompromise runs the risk of removing all\nserious debate from the last chamber\nprepared to challenge the idea that Tony\nBlair has papal infallibility. The debate to\ndate has been too narrow, and has\nmissed some very important aspects. For\na start everyone assumes that the Lords\nmust be reformed. This is a general is a tion, but if the popular will is behind\nreform (most people couldn't care less),\nlet us look at the bones of contention.\nLeaving aside the over arching class war\npolitics of certain Labour MPs, the main\nVoice of Reason\nirritation seems to be the perceived\ninbuilt Tory majority caused by the hereditary members, which is occasionally\nexercised by dragging old duffers out of\nthe woodwork in order to block a Government bill. This problem, in principle,\nis easy to solve. Minimum attendance\nand voting requirements should be\nestablished, thus preventing peers\nappearing once a decade when\ninstructed to. If you discard those hereditary peers who have no interest in voting on a regular basis, the majority for\nthe most part disappears.\nThe House of Lords is principally a revising chamber, rendering it very different from the primary legislative body.\nIn order to strengthen this further, the\nparty whip system could be removed\nfrom the Lords. Some feel that the press-ganging of Honourable Members damages its credibility, and so such a move\nwould help to address this point. I don't feel that c it her is particularly necessary,\nbut both suggestions are more constructive than the damage currently\nbeing wreaked on this country by Blair\nand his cronies. At the end of the day,\nthe Lords' biggest failing is that of t radi tion. It does not sit comfortably with this\nCool Britiannia rubbish, so must be\n'rebranded.1\nTrouble is, it looks like He'll\nget away with it, because the strength of\nour parliamentary system is that it does-n't adversely affect people's lives. If\nthings were bad, people would take\nnotice. Oh, to be Italian...\nAnd Finally.\nM any of you know that I have\nhad a enormous bee in my\nbonnet of late, namely the\npolythene wrapper stuck in a tree by\nthe Central Library. It arrived there about\ntwo years ago, and has survived wind,\nrain and snow. I expected that it would\nbe removed in the run-up to the Royal\nVisit. Alas, while the budget for Chinese\ngranite and exotic bedding plants\napproached that for missiles in the US,\nthere was no money left for a blok e with a long stick.\nIt has now, however, miraculously\ndisappeared. It can't just have fallen from\nits perch, it must have been pushed (or\npulled), and only one man could be\nresponsible for this, lan Caldwell. If you\nwere that man, then congratulations are\nin order, otherwise we have a mystery\ncharacter intent on Campus Renaissance,\nalbeit on a smaller scale. I shall muse on\nthis over the turkey this Christmas and\ngive you an answer in the New Year. On\nthat note, have a Happy Christmas, watch\na few programmes recommended by\nthat blok e Baker elsewhere in this august\njournal and, if the Devil drives, have a quick flick through those lecture notes.\nSee you in '99.\n\n"

    "content": "16 December 1998 Columns 11\nThe New List Power\nElectronic mailing lists are a convenient and valuable form of communication between like-minded\npeople. A 'list' allows a member to tell\nthe other members of events or opinions\nrelevant to the subject of the list, thus\npossibly opening up a discussion. There\nwere days when the mere idea of being\non a list was exciting, as for running\none, that was outright prestigious. Today,\nalmost everybody's running a list or two,\nor are they? What are the repercussions\nof this new-found 'list power'? A list\nrequires a central account, an email\naddress, to which members address their\nemails. Furthermore, at that address a software program needs to be set up to\nsend out incoming messages to the\nmembers. In the old days, to run a list,\nyou had to get thc central account, then\nyou had to either set up some software\nor write your own software to do the\nmailing-out of messages. Then, once the\nlist is launched and people (mostly\nft i ends at first) have joined up, you\nneeded to draw up a constitution and\ndefine the list's etiquette. You also had\nto decide who would have the 'executive' power of removing someone from\nthe list. Why all this bureaucracy?\nBecause it was such a 'power' thing!\nWhether you should do all of the\nabove by 'populist' means or by\n'absolute' means was the subject of\nintense debate on many a list's 'traffic'.\nYou see, if John were the Ahmed\nabsolutist-type 'list man-ager', he would argue that since it was\nhe who started the list, he has thc right\nto exclude those he deems unwelcome\nin it and to decide thc list's stand on\nissues. I am not depriving people of any\nhuman rights, or treating them less\nequally, John would say. Go and start\nyour own list if you don't like mine, he\nwould beckon knowing full well that it is\nquite difficult to start a list. Il elen,a 'com-mon' list member would respond by saying that after joining the list she has\nbecome a virtual partner with the man-ager. The list is what it is because of her\nand other members like her, she would\nsay. Cue intense debate and possible\nflame wars. Most lists share a pattern;\nthc 'founding fathers' draw up more or\nless the rules of the list and effectively\ncontrol it by consensus among them.\nBut watch out if those guys fall out!\nMany a 'war' for control of a list has\nerupted!\nWell, things have changed, first it\nwas free email address hosting: usa.net,\nhotmail, yahoo, netscape, and so on.\nNow it is free list hosting: e groups, one list, and cool list. You log on to one\nof these sites, and within minutes you're\nready to launch your own list. Your\nfriendly, free, list service providers are\ndoing all thc technical work. And this\ntime, it is cleat, it is acknowledged; you\nShihab own\"1 C 'isl\n* \"1 is m can s if you don't like some-one's 'contributions' you remove them\nand this time no feelings of self-doubt or\nothers doubting your integrity can be\ntoo strong. If anyone is not happy they\ncan go on lo create their own list, and\nthis time you mean It. It is free and open\nfor all. You are not providing a special\n'service' to which people are entitled by\nvirtue of your humane responsibility of\nreaching out to them. You arc seizing an\nopportunity to network with other people and volunteering your time to manage that effort.\nThere is a downside to this re vol u tion: fragmentation. Keen underwater\nphotographers would join a1000 strong\nworld-wide under wat et photography list,\ndespite getting flooded with emails from\nphotographers all around Ihe globe, simply because it is the only specialist list of\nits kind. Now a London underwater photographer can have his own UK list.\nAnother chap may think the UK list is too\nLondon-centred and start his own Yorkshire Underwater Photography list. Pretty\nsoon you may begin to wonder why you\nneed a list service if you're only mailing\nabout ten other people! Indeed, this\nnew 'list power' is taking away from the\nreal power of mailing lists; communicating with large numbers of people, most\nof whom you don't know.\nOne of the facilities I found powerful in the one of thc services (e groups) was that of polling members of a list. As\na member of a list, you can poll the list\nmembers on any subject of your choice.\nOf course, it is up to them to lake part,\nand they can choose not to. I low ever the possibilities of using the polling\nresults arc very interesting. Imagine a poll conducted on the fore-mentioned\n1000-strong underwater photography list\non recommended cameras plus accessories. Imagine thc marketing potential\nof selling specialised products to these\npeople. Of course, nothing's new here,\nyou could have always done that before,\nbut now it is ever more convenient.\nIhe internet continues its march of\nempowering users not only with information but with free web pages, email\naccounts, and now lists. All of this so far\nis at Ihe expense of the sponsors, keeping in mind that a lot of these free-ser-vice companies are in it for thi- long\nterm rewards. I don't think the freebies\nthat users are currently getting will stop\nsoon. Meanwhile, companies are collecting huge databases of who their\nusers are, their email addresses, their\ninterests and activities, and so on. But\nlet's not get too cynical, a lot of what is\nhappening on the internet is fantastic,\ntoo good to be true in some ways. The\nnew list power is one such happening.\nLet's communicate!\nHipczrial College Sports Cfcmflt\nChristinas and New (/gar\nOpening Times\nMonday 21 December 1998 7.00am8.00 pm Monday\nTuesday 22 December 1998 7.00am8.00 pm Tuesday\nWednesday 23 December 1998 7.00am8.00 pm Wednesday\nThursday 24 December 1998 Closed Thursday\nFriday 25 December 1998 Closed Friday\nSaturday 26 December 1998 Closed Saturday\nSunday 27 December 1998 10.00am4.00 pm Sunday\nTHE SPORTS CENTRE STAFF WISH YOU A HEALTHY28 December 1998\n29 December 1998\n30 December 1998\n31 December 1998\n1 January 1999\n2 January 1999\n3 January 1999\n10.00am4.00p m10.00am4.00 pm10.00 am4.00 pm Closed\nClosed\n9.00am5.00p m9.00am5.00 pm CHRISTMAS AND A SPORTY NEW YEAR!

    "content": "16 December 1998 Arts 15\n100 MASTERPIECES OF IMPERIAL CHINESE CERAMICS FROM THE AD\nBAR LING COLLECTION\nRoyal Academy of Arts\np: Western world In the 18th century.\nIn contrast, China's ceramic production\noriginated during the Bronze Age. With\nsuch a flourishing past, craftsmen\nattained incredible levels of technical\nproficiency. Under the influence of the\nemperor and senior court officials, potters and decorators experimented pro-fuse ly, exploring form and function in\naccordance with fashion.\nThis legendary collection, which\nover the past 25 years by the entrepreneur and connoisseur Au Bak Ling. This\neagerly anticipated event was its first\never public viewing. The exhibition outlines the highlights of Chinese porcelain\nmanufacture, as well as reflecting parallel developments in cultural history. The\ndisplayed pieces, hailed as unique\nnational treasures, date from between\nthe 12th and 18th centuries, covering the\nSong, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties.\nThe varied designs arc\neither sophisticated with\nsimple glazing or vibrantly\nornamented, with fiery\ndragon emblems and\ncolourful floral motifs. In\nview of the highly specialised subject matter, this\nstylish exhibition is basically geared towards\nSinophiles or dedicated\nenthusiasts.\nHelena\nUntil 20th December\nNearest tube: Green Park/\nPiccadilly Circus\nTickets: \u00a33, concessions\n\u00a32.50\nOpening hours: daily 10am6 pm(8.30 pm on Lridays)\nCINDERELLA\nLyric Theatre Hammersmith\nW ith the countdown to Christmas\nin full swing, this section would\nbe shamefully incomplete without mentioning that most sacred and\nvenerated of festive traditions-the inimitable pantomime.\nAdmittedly, I was slightly dubious on\nsurveying my fellow spectators, since I estimated the average age of the audience to be about eight! (after all, this is\nblatant family entertainment) Undeterred\nby my fidgeting neighbours however, I settled down to watch the production\nbilled as 'a new telling of an old classic'.\nAlthough during one worrying scene,\nthe excruciatingly shy Buttons threatened to ride into the sunset with the\ncomely crumpet (much to the horror of\nthe distraught and disillusioned crowd!),\nAngela Cartet's interpretation remained\nreassuringly faithful to the classic. Well,\nmost of the time at least... Somehow, I don't quite remember the evil stepmother brandishing a carving knife (pre-vio us ly concealed in her cleavage!) and\nhacking off her daughters' toes or heel\nin a desperate attempt to squeeze their\nfeet into the celebrated glass slipper.\nThe actors, with the exception of\nthe bland and amateurish dead mother\ncum fairy godmother, worked enthusiastically as a team, improvising liberally\nto suit the audience's responses. Cinders, sporting ragged petticoats and charcoal smudges, was perfectly irritating\nwith her goody-two-shoes naivety and\nher unwavering habit of exclaiming\n\"weird\" during her magical adventures in\npan to land. In contrast, the\ncross-dressing ugly sisters\nduo was extremely farcical in\ncurlers and pink neglig es with fake-fur trimmings.\nTheir antics and snappy dialogue (with lyrics such as\n\"The prince will be thrilled to\nbits/By the size of my... per-son ali ty\") raised much laughter rivalled only by the s nog finale that caused a wave of\nsnickering amongst the\njunior clique, accompanied\nby murmurs of \"kiss y w issy\". Probably the most\nimpressive aspect of this pro-duct ion, staged by the\nImprobable Theatre, were\nthe inventive special effects\nand resourceful props. Giant\ncardboard cut-outs were surprisingly effective as scenery,\ncreating an almost illusory\natmosphere whereas crumpled newspaper sheets were\nmoulded into ghostly crea-ture s, further enhancing the\nfantasy.\nl uncles s musical interludes and puppet sketches were integrated into this\namusing extravaganza. Perhaps the highlight of the evening was a ridiculous rendition of 'Cheese in the Moonlight'\nperformed by a squeaky chorus of marionette mice. Pantomimes definitely rank\nbeyond the ridiculous, obscure and\ncorny, yet they're genuinely enjoyable if\nyou join in the formulaic spirit along the\ncondensed lines of \"Once upon a time...behind you...oh! yes he is...happily\never after\".\nHelena\nUntil 9th January\nNearest tube: Hammersmith\nTickets: from \u00a35\n\n"

    "content": "16 December 1998 FiC tJ Of l\"*23 Orange Flying Things...\n\"Aaargh\", exclaimed Bob, \"It's those damned flying\norange things again.\" It was a new sport and it pissed\nBob off. I hey were really noisy, and came in at around\nhead height, never actually hitting you, but they never\nfailed to make him jump out of his skin. And you know\nhow hard it is to get back into your skin.\nBob was on his way to see Oli. Oil was a great friend\nbut had recently stopped coming out on the piss so\nmuch and Bob wanted to find out why. \"How is a man\nmeant to get pissed and make a fool of himself on the\ndance floor if you can't rely on a friend to carry you\nhome!\" thought Bob as he narrowly missed stepping in\nsome dog shit on the pavement.\nWhen he arrived at Oli's there was a horrible stench,\nbut this was normal because Oli lived in a condemned\nabattoir. The firm that owned it had gone bust and just\nshut all the doors; Oli was always finding a new carcass\nas he explored around the vast depot. Bob crawled\nunder a fence, pulled at a door and, when it finally\nyielded, made his way in. Oli's front room had many\nstrange things in it, not least a crystal chandelier. When\nBob had asked where it came from he had shrugged,\n\"I always 'ad it\" he'd said. The room was clean and the\nodour less strong but still apparent, waiting to catch you\nas you went into the corridor beyond, from there you\ncould see onto the main floor of the abattoir, one storey\nbelow, where many beasts, plump and t cady for s laugh ter, must have lowed their last. A lost orange thing was\nfloating around the vast room; Bob smiled and went to\nget Oli's 'doorbell': A12 bore that he kept by his front\ndoor. Bob shouldered it as he walked towards the bal-co ny. He lean t over and started to track the orange thing\nas it drifted randomly about. He clipped off the safety\ncatch then continued to track. Bob felt good to be able\nto end one of these infuriating things, he sav our ed the\nmoment. Then he squeezed the trigger, Blam, the\nsound echoed around thc vast, deserted room; bits of\norange spread started to fall down to the ground\nbelow. Then there was a shout, \"Hey there, Bob? Yeah\nit is.\" Bob looked for the owner of the\nvoice, Oli. He saw him at the far end of\nthe corridor. \"I 've been sorely tempted\nto do that myself, but I knew how much\nyou hate them and I thought you'd be\nround soon.\"\n\"Yep well 'ere I am. Where you\nbeen recently, I 've been missing you\ndown the Three Crowns\" Bob said three\nas is if the crowns were free.\n\"Yeah well I 've been busy lately,\nI'm setting something up here you\nknow.\"\n\"Well no, actually, cause I haven't spoken to you cause you've not been\ndown the crown 'ave you.\"\n\"Fair point there, but come down\n'ere and I 'll show you.\"\nBob followed him down a manhole that he had never noticed before.\nHe came to the bottom of a ladder\nand looked around for Oli. He could sec\nnothing. There was a loud thump and\na scream, then silence. Thc smell here\nwas worse than ever, but then Bob\nrealised that he had lost control of his\nbladder, he smiled, it was warm and he\nwas prepared, his incontinence pants\nhad arrived last week from the ad in the\nback of thc Mail. \"Oli you tw at, quit ar sing around, and\nshow me what you have been up to.\"\n\"Damn, I thought I'd have fooled you.\"\n\"Well maybe you did for a minute\" Bob kept quiet\nabout the accident; he would nip off to thc loo when\nit began to cool down.\n\"OK, back up the ladder then and on to the garage.\"\n\"You what? You b tought mc down here just to try\nand scare me?\"\n\"Well yeah, but is that not OK?\"\n\"You're an arse!\" The pair arrived at the door to the\ngarage, which used to be a lorry loading port. Bob\npaused to let Oli open the door, he did not trust him\nnot to haye planned another elaborate practical joke,\nbut Oli went st taigh t in. Bob followed, not knowing what\nto expect.\nThere was the normal garage clutter, tools spread\nout over every horizontal surface, newspaper spread out\ncovered in drips of paint and oil. The dominating feature of the room, however, was a large shape in the\ncentre of thc room with a huge heavy blue tarpaulin\ndraped over it. The shape looked like a great fish, but\nsurely not.\n\"Well?\" said Bob\n\"Give us a hand with the tarpaulin.\" The pair struggled to pull off the blue wrap. It seemed to be a fish\nwith wheels, a big fib rc glass fish with wheels. \"What the\nffff u...?\" \"Mobile fish and chips\" cut in Oli; \"I can start making some money at last.\"\n\"Oh...\" thought Bob, \"I was expecting something a little more exciting, really. Anyway what's wrong with\ncarrying on nicking stuff like you were.\"\n\"You know me too well, this is all part of a plan, I am tired of nicking f tom houses and little corner shops,\nI want one last robbery then I can retire.\"\n\"Retire? It's not like you work for a living anyway.\"\n\"Well you know what I mean.\"\n\"Do I? \"Just being able to own a house, do what I want\nand not having to worry about the next bill.\"\n\"What bills?! You live in a condemned abattoir, the\nelectricity comes from the factory next door, water\ndirect from thc mains underneath and you don't have\na phone.\"\n\"There are other things, and I need to eat, and go\nout on thc piss as you said earlier.'\n\"Yeah OK, but how Is a chip van shaped like a fish\ngoing to help?\"\n\"I am going to steal all thc drain covers, manhole\ncovers, and hydrants in fond on.\" \"How can you retire on cast iron?\"\n\"Don't you see? It will be such a hazard with all\nthose holes in the ground that thc council will be des-per ate! Then I will hold all the covers ransom.\"\n\"You n utter, how much for?\"\n\"That depends, half a million to lots more, depends\non demand.\"\n\"Demand?\"\n\"Yeah, if lots of accidents happen and it gets a lot\nof press coverage then I can expect loads.\"\n\"Wow, but why thc chip van?\"\n\"I can park above a drain, sell chips and nick thc\ncover.\"\n\"You can't do both at once.\"\n'That's why I am telling you!\"\nBob and Oli are both in jail. They share a cell and\na four year sentence. They were thc laughing stock of\nthc press for about a week; after they asked for a ransom it took the police a day to track them down. The\nfish, the police said in a press report, had been spot-led round fond on and they were about to be collared\nfor operating without a license anyway.\nLast week, due to popular demand, the government issued all prison inmates an orange flying thing.\nHairsaloN\nC UT8c BLOW DRY BY OUR TOP STYLISTS \u00a3 2 0 LAO IES \u00a3 1 7 MEN Normal Price \u00a335\nACCESS VISA MASTERCARD CASH CHEQUES( Still the best student offer!'\n15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington\nLondon SW7 3ES( I Minute walk from South Kensington Tube)\nTelephone 0171 823 8968\n\n"

On the\nway Alice steadfastly refused to go In\ngoal, so after a lot of well apl lied pre s sure, Annmarie was forced in goal for\nher debut per of rm ance. In the meantime, the opposition\nhad a full team and the i er coach was the\numpire. Sound unfair?\nIC created tons of chances, but the\nfat lucky bastards kept kicking It away.\nThey could run but kept forgetting the\nall important factor - i.e. the ball.\nFull time came and went really\nquickly and the IC troopers were faced\nwith the pos sibi lt iy of penalty flicks. Annmarie, the debut goalie, was a star, saving several of their crappy attempts.\nUnder intense pressure the flicks went\nto sudden death, but un fortuna tley their\ngoalie smelt too bad and IC were put off,\nlosing after a storming effort.\nWe did, however, get revenge when\nDiane, the sly one, managed to suru pti cio us ly pinch their balls.\nWe had a great match and definite ley should have won.\nCycling\nMonths of hard training paid off with\nrecord breaking results for the roadie s at\nthe cycling club.\nAt the BUSA Hill Climb, in conditions more suited to the boat club 12th,25 th and 48th positions were achieved\nrep sect iv ely by Hedley, Tarik and Colin\nrespectively.\nA few weeks later they were abc k in\naction at the fast es track in the world,\nthe Manchester velodrome. Pitted\nagainst the likes of Ross Muir, and athlete supported by Chris Boardman, Hedley only just qualified for the quarters of\nthe 4K pursuit in 5 mins highlighting\nthe fact that the standard was higher\nthan at the nationals. He achieved an\neventual 6th place. Chris put in solid performances setting a personal bets in\nthe Team Pursuit and Tairk rode to top\n20 placings in the kilo and pursuit.\nNext up are the BUSA team time trial\nand MTB championships, where\nstrength in depth is a key requirement.\nWe the r fore urge those keen in participating to contact us at Hedley.Skelton@ic.ac.uk.\nKeep an eye out for our new website!\nIC Hockey\nIC 2 - 4 GKT\nThe most crucial game of the season so\nfar and we lost.\nFor the first ten minutes we totally\ndominated the game, but only managed to convert one of our many\nclear en ces which was put away by 11 +\nfrom one of our many short corners.\nfalling asleep at the most important moments seems to be one of the\nfew faults the defence has. However,\ntoday it was comatose as the equalise r was knocked in in the softest fashion.\nSecond a hlf and we were raring to go.\nBut they scored twice while we slept.\nWe got one back, but then they\nregained their two goal lead. With only\n2 minutes to go eight local kids decided\nto start a fight with 22 players holding\ntheir sticks. Intelligence I think was a bit\nlacking on their part but as one player\npointed out, \"They were abused children\". Oh well, we're through to the\nBUSA shield which we will win.\nMerry Christmas from the\nSports team\nNetball\nRoyal Vets 38 - 38 IC(2/12/98)\nKings 36- 14 IC(9/12/98)\nOn Wednesday 2nd, Imperial took on\nthe Vets at home. We fought hard with\nthe last quarter turning into a real bat-tle. Vicki flew across the court picking\nup a huge graze on her leg and was\nshortly followed in less dramatic style by\nAbi. Despite the carnage, Imperial, who\nwere trailing right up to the last minute,\ngot it back to draw the match 38 all.\nLast week, the girls took on Kings in the\nBUSA playoffs. A win would have\nsecured a place in the national finals.\nFortunatley, we wanted a place in the\nshield so we lost 36-14. Backhanders in\nbrown envelopes were not needed as\nthe umpiring was somewhat dubious\n(maybe they got the bor w n envelopes?\n- Gus). Blood was shed again, this time\nby Rachel and Paula and entertainment\nwas provided by the Kings centre, with\nher frog-like leaps.\nAttention all IC girls!\nFrom January 1999. Netball coaching\nwill take place on Thursday lunchtimes\n12-2pm at the Prince's Gardens court. All\nabilities welcome.

This unbeaten\nrun places us firmly at the top of the division 2 league table. In a recent edition\nof the London Student Newspaper, ICSM\n2 were predicted as favourites for promotion in division 2.\nHowever, looking at IC seconds\nleague record to date you would have to\nbe a fool not to see that we will be\nleague champions.\nThe game against ICSM 2 began 45\nminutes later than the scheduled kick off\ntime of 2:15pm. Punctual IC seconds\nwere present at the ICSM ground at\n2:00pm but ICSM were nowhere in sight.\nFinally they did arrive and we sporting ly decided to play the game and not take\na walkover.\nDespite key absences from the lineup the first half saw characteristic second\nteam dominance. IC seconds created a number of chances but the game\nremained scoreless until Martin Archbold tucked away Dave Hinslewoods\nshot which the keeper parried. At the half\ntime interval the score remained 1-0 to\nthe seconds. The second half proved a different picture as ICSM laid siege to the\nIC goal finally equal ising mid way\nthrough the half. This half will be best\nremembered for the football which spat\noff pieces of leather every time it was\nkicked and for Felix nearly sending one\nof the ICSM players into orbit. All things\nconsidered, the final score was a fair\nreflection and we look forward to playing ICSM again on Wednesday.\n4th XI\nIC IV 2 - 0 RHUL IV\nSaturday 5th December\nRandomness is bad, and we were very\nrandom. But, then again, we were good\nenough to win and beat the Holloway\nPeasants. After meeting in the Quad we\nhad nine players, no referee and no\ntransport. As if by magic a coach\nappeared and we managed to start the\ngame with as many as ten players. Holloway always used to be strong but that\nseems to have changed, especially with\nHolloway firsts facing the prospect of relegation from the ULU Premier Division.\nThe quality of football we played\nwith our ten men in the first half was sub-lime; never in my five years have I known\na Fourth XI play such entertaining, skilful\nfootball. One move started with Steve\nwinning the ball on the right flank, then\nensuring we kept possession we played\nit back through our defence, then across\nthe mid fic ld and back to the right wing.\nA near perfect cross was then headed\nnarrowly wide by one of our strikers. It\nwould have been the goal of the season\nat any level.\nWhen our eleventh man turned up\nwe relaxed slightly until half-time, but\nthen our inspirational Captain, ti lio t \"The\nRugga-bug gar\" Newsome arrived following a seven hour journey (That's commitment for you). Thus after a reshuffle\nwe dominated the second half and with\nease went on to win 2-0. The first goal\ncame from a Taylor corner that Nima\nturned in at the back post. And another\nquality move resulted in Nima, again,\ncalmly slotting home from 15 yards.\nAll in all another professional performance from the Fourths which, of\ncourse, bodes well for the future.\nSkiing\nThe second race of the IC kings league\ncampaign was held in more clement\nweather than required for skiing on the\n28th of March.\nThe race happenings were very good for\nboth the teams and on a purely sporting\npoint of view, reflect two quality entries\n(both teams).\nThe first team came 7th, only narrowly\nbeaten by a team from Kent in the playoffs for 1 -4th and 5-8th. After this, all was lost or rather just\nthe races. I take a break from the first\nteam here but will later reveal impotant\nd 'oh very important information about\nsome of our members (mentioning no\nnames Gareth Hall and Sarah Llizabeth\nHughes), and why we did not do as well\nas we might have.\nBut first to congratulate the second\nteam for a very good performance placing them 10th overall. 30 teams were\npresent including many 1st teams beaten\nby our seconds. Note that UCL came\nway down the list (hah a) and ICSM came\na few places above IC firsts (again) Back\nto the proper reporting of back pages...\nIt was found out that 2 of our members\nhad been sleeping together on the back\nseat of a car on the way. We had suspected something before but never\nthought they would push their laziness\nthat far. It was then discovered that they\nactually lived in the same house or at\nleast they were planning on going home\ntogether. But you may say this is none of\nthe ski clubs business.\nAny one interested in skiing or writing for felix please contact ski@ic.ac.uk\nas we are talented at neither, (except\nmaybe skiing) Careth Hall (ICracer)\n\n"

    "content": "16 December 1998 Columns\nGoGo Girl So you didn't win the National Lottery Superdraw no surprise there\nthen. But here is the story of a woman who won the corporate e qui va lent. Meet Barbara Cassani the Chief\nExecutive Officer of Go, the new low\ncost airline from British\nAirways. Unless you\nhave been living underground for thc past\nseven months, or you\nhave been so into your\ncourse that you haven't left the lab, you cannot\nhave failed to miss Go's massive press and\nposter campaign. (I 've\ngot my own poster courtesy of a certain\njubilee line train).\nSo the question is what would you\ndo if you had \u00a325 million to start a brand\nspanking new airline? Go opened for\nbusiness on 2 April this year with six\nplanes and three destinations; Rome,\nMilan and Copenhagen. However, it's been no easy ride. Competition in the airline industry is fierce. The high fixed\ncosts mean that this is definitely an industry for the big boys and girls. Having\n'...what would you\ndo if you had \u00a325\nmillion to start a brand spanking\nnew airline...\"\ninvested so much to get the it businesses\noff the ground the existing players are\nnot going to quietly walk out. The budget airline market is starting to look distinctly overcrowded with companies such\nas Easyjet, Dedonair, Ryanair, and Virgin\nf xpress vying for pass en gers. The extent of the\ncompetition is demonstrated by the fact that\nEasyjet has taken legal\naction against BA, accusing it of cross-sub sidi sing Go. It is a fair bet that\nfive years down the line\nsome of the present\ncompanies will have\nbeen squeezed out of the market.\nSo what strategies is Cassani employing to ensure that Go will be a major\nforce in the coming years? Go is attempting to be the standard by which all other\nbudget airlines are measured. Its aim is\nto provide an outstanding service, reliability and flair in addition to the low fares.\nIt is also spending heavily on advertising\nto create a strong brand awareness.\nHence, you see its posters blaze ned over\nbuses, underground trains and taxis.\nA remarkable feature of Go is the\nrapid rate of expansion it is attempting.\nSince its inception earlier this year Go has\nbeen adding new routes and new\nplanes, and increasing the frequency of\nflights to existing routes at ab teak neck speed. Go has more\nthan doubled its fleet to \"...five years down\nthirteen aircraft and is\nintending to double its the line so me of\nworkforce over the next\ntwo years. This would the present comp a challenge the management skills of even the nie SWi most competent exec u sure that questions will be asked.\nGo is, however, very much Cassani's baby. She was BA's General Manager in\nthc United States when in May of last\nyear she was of feted the chance to\ndevelop a business plan for a new low-cost airline operating out\nof Stanstcd. from her\nexperience in the States,\nwhere she had witnessed the large operators ignoring the new\nlost-cost airlines until\nhave been they had taken a significant chunk of the market\nti ve. Apart from managing thc new staff\nmembers and the inevitable teething\nproblems of expanding any business\nthere is the question of finance. You had\nbetter get your cash flow projections\nright when operating in such a capital\nintensive business. Cassani is fortunate\nthat instead of relying on bank finance\nshe is answerable to BA, who obviously\nhave a greater understanding of the airline business. However, targets are targets no matter who is providing the\nfinance. If they are not met you can be\nsqueezed out...\" share, she knew some\nof thc mistakes to avoid.\nTherefore, she accepted the offer on thc\nproviso that if the show did get on the\nrunway she would run it. She has been\ninvolved in every aspect of Go from the\ndetail of thc cabin crew uniforms lo\ndeveloping thc Go corporate identity\nand ethos. The fot mer management consultant and big company executive has\ngot the job most managers would dream\nof; running their own company. In that\nsense she is as fortunate as any Superdraw winner.\nPresidential Talk-Back\n\u2022 was going to talk about thc pt icc of\nI Imperial College's catering today,\nI but something far more controversial has come up.\nFirst some background. The Constituent College Unions (CCUs) have\ntraditionally had certain clubs and societies under their wings. Some of these\nhave been seen as appropriate for\nexample a CCU sports team, but others less so. All of the other clubs and\nsocieties of the Union are looked after\nby a Club and Societies Committee\n(CSC) of which there are six, based on\nthe type of club or society they are (for\nexample athletic or recreational).\nThe problem has been that over\nrecent years (possibly due to thc\ndemise of the CCUs themselves or just\nthe inappropriate position of these\nclubs) the clubs and societies of the\nCCUs have not been run as effectively\nas those in CSCs. This t aises quite a few issues.\nAs a sabbatical it is extremely frustrating for clubs or societies to either\nlose money, not follow financial procedures or put us in positions where\nsomething has to be done immediately, because of a lack of planning,\ntaking up agt eat deal of our time\nthat could be\navoided, the o the t issue is Health and\nSafety. As President of the Union I am ultimately\nresponsible fot thc\nhealth and safety\nof every student\nthat takes part in a Union activity.\nthe CCUs slow\nup the flow of\ninformation from\nand to the Union,\nand this results in\nmajor problems.\nFinancial responsibility forms are not\nsigned, subs not paid in, events not\nproperly planned and as a result the\nclubs and societies are not run as\neffectively as they could be.\nOne concern of the CCUs is the\nloss of identity of the clubs if they are\nDavid Hellard, ICU President\nfinancially controlled by the\nCSCs, which could\ncause a drop in\nparticipation, but\nquite the reverse\nis true. Effectively\nrun clubs will be\nmore successful,\ntheir money will\ngo further, the it events better and\nthis will encourage\nparticipation, lifting the image of\nthc; CCUs, some-i thing thai is so\ndesperately needed. Removing control of thc\nI inane es ol the\nclubs and societies\nfrom the CCUs\ndoes not severe the links between\nthem. They will still have thc same\nme mbc t ship, alumni, traditions and\ninput into the CCUs if they so desire\nA very worrying aspect of the clubs\nand societies being under the control\nof the CCUs is that we have no idea if\nthey have done risk assessments, if\nthey are following thc health and\nsafety policy or if they ate taking adequate precautions. I am not happy\nbeing responsible for clubs or societies activities when I have very little\ncontrol over their health and safety.\nUndet CSCs this is not a major pro b lem.\nIf the CCUs ate to survive in thc\nfuture they will need participation at\nthe grass root level which can fil t ct up,\nand the most obvious way to do this\nis through their clubs and societies.

    "content": "16 December 1998\nBECK\nTi\nBeck checks for lice.\nhe album is called Mutations and Beck certainly must have been in an altered state of mind\nwhen he wrote it. All the tracks were written\nwhilst he was on tour for his massive album, Odelay\nand it's cleat that these sort of things must have a pretty big effect on him.\nGone is the characteristic cacophony of samples\nvying for your attention and attacking your brain. In are\nmore mellow lyrics and disguised beats. Don't get me\nwrong, this album has rhythm but it's not Beck's trademark style. In songs such as Cold Brains and Tropicalia\nwe heat Beck producing work sounding pretty similar\nto the Eels, which works really well. It puts across the\nmind-numbing boredom that comes with being on\nthe road with lyrics like, 'No thoughts, no mind, To rot\nbehind' and the apparent disgust with which he views\nthe metropolis' of America, 'All the streets, They reek\nof t topical charms...Where tourists snore and decay.'\nIt seems that Beck has taken a step back and concentrated more on the message of his work and its con-tent, whilst producing some truly great songs for this\nalbum. He has surpassed himself in the blinding tune\nthat is Diamond Bollocks. This is classic Beck with the\nhat det beats and monumental musical flair with which\nhe puts a tune to get he t.Il alf way through the track,\nbecause he is just so good, he takes a time out and\ninserts 10 seconds of bird song. Superb. It's flashpoint s ike this that make Beck appealing today. Ftesh-ness,\ninnovation and a touch of eccentricity is so rarely found\naround these musical parts nowadays.\nOn the other hand, this album could also be seen\nas patchy but Beck him s lef admits that this album is\neffectively a scrapbook of songs written be fot e his\nnext majo t release sometime next year. I low ever, if you\nreally want to see another side of this genius then I recommend this album, \"those of you that would rather\nsave your money for something important this winter,\nlike heating, then wait. If you don't mind sleeping in the\nentire contents of your wardrobe to stay warm then buy\nthis album. H Simon\nFAITH NO MORE\nWho Cares A Lot?\nMike Patton (Left) Is challenged to down the chill sauce In one.\nW hen I got this album to review I was ecstatic! faith No More were my\nheroes of adolescence. I couldn't believe it when I read the one line in\nNME, 'Faith No More have split up.' Ile re is a collection of their best\nsongs all on one CD. I would hate to be the guy who had to select these fifteen\n'greatest' songs from the Faith No More back catalogue, but whoever it was has\ndone well. This compilation provides a well-rounded view of the band's different\nphases and styles through the years. This is no l easy, because each of FNM's albums is dramatically different. I his is partly to do with the arrival and departure\nof several band members following the band's legendary in-fighting which makes\nthe Gallaghers seem cute and cuddly by comparison. Even Courtney Love fronted\nthe band briefly in 1983, and it's a shame no recordings were made at this time.\nThe compilation starts, naturally enough with the an the mic We Care A Lot with\noriginal singer Chuck Mosely sounding hoarse and shout y. Mike Patton took over\nthe vocals for the rest of their career, and his arrival started a period which had some;\nof their most commercial songs. This was when the band gained most success, especially when their single Epic reached the US top 10.\nThe next three songs, Midlife Crisis, Small Victory, and the darkly cynical Easy\nall come off the album Angel Dust, recorded when the band was probably at its\nmost fragmented, especially with Mike Patton often putting his project Mr Bungle\nbefore his FNM duties. Guitarist 'Big' Jim Martin left soon after the album was\nreleased, and the next album King For A Day... Fool For A lifetime showed a huge\ndifference in musical style without Martin's influence; being much more basic, head-down rocking but with more production polish than earlier recordings.\nThe final few songs are from the ironically titled Album oFthe Year, released in\n1997. This has them becoming more conventional, although never losing that FNM\nmagic.\nOverall, Who Cares A Lot? is, a great collection from a great band. It offers an\nexcellent introduction if you haven't heard much FNM before, but the older fans\nwill probably find it more useful to buy the re-released back catalogue, now all on\nmid-price, to fill in the gaps in their collection.\nIt is almost impossible to sum up a seventeen year career with one album. Any\nband that can survive through all the trials and tribulations that being in a music\nband entails and come out the other side deserves credit. As I said, it's difficult to\ncondense into one album but this seems to have done the job quite well. CI\nTom\n\n"

    "content": "Letters & Small Ads 16 December 1998\nSTA a Step Too Far?\nDear Felix,\nI am writing with regards to the article by\nDavid Roberts in your 7/12/98 issue of Felix\nentitled: \"STA to be Superceeded\".\nFrom this article, I was struck by the\ndescribed dealings between the College\nand the Students' Union. My arguments\nwill take a more basic legal approach, as\nthe simple concept of a union does not\nseem to suffice.\nIt is clear that the union is having difficulties with the college's financial deal-in gs.I must highlight several key items to\nthe union and college alike:\n1) The union represents the interests\nof this college's students.\n2) Students are customers of the uni-vers it y not part of the university's hierarchy (LEA's are sponsors, and fees paid are\nstill for provision of a service).\n3) The college is not part of the civil\nservice, and is therefore legally treated as\nany other organisation/corporation: charitable or not.\n4) The union is an integral part of the\nuniversity and is there to ensure, as\nelected by students, that the service provided meets the service advertised by the\ncollege, and indeed the University of London.\n5) By no means is the College legally\nentitled to allow external organisations to\nhave commercial practice on campus\nwithout the agreement of its customers,\nthe students. This is a breach of contract\nas the provision of a service we all sign for\neach year is that of being provided with\nan academic course and academic-related\nservices - not for on-site commercial facilities. These may only be provided with the\nagreement of the customer (student) as\na ratification of the initial contract for provision of a service.\n5b) Assuming the academic service is\nargued to include these commercial ser-vices, it is still necessary for the customers\nto agree to a change, as a such change\nis not stipulated in thc original service\nprovided by the college and signed for by\neach and every one of us.\n6) Each student in college has the\nright to sue the college for not providing\nthe service signed for (in this case, the use\nof STA, or the inclusion of a non-agreed\nchange in service) - or the union may do\nso on behalf of the student community.\nYours truly,\nAshley Fterrenschmidt-Mollet (Aero)\nIt's great that there are people who care\nenough to contribute like this, but I feel\nthat the Union probably know their legal\nrights. - Ed\nGayed: \"Time... to Resign\"\nDear Felix,\nI have just attended last nights meeting\nof thc ICU Council [8 December - Ed],\nwhere we discussed the possibility of CCU\nclubs coming under the administrative\ncontrol of CSCs rather than their respective CCUs. Without going into the details\nof such a proposal it seems such a move\nwould affect about 3 or 4 dubs from each\nof RCSU, C& GU and RSMU, it would also\naffect about 25 ICSMU clubs. You might\nthink therefore that representatives from\neach of the CCUs would be present, and\nthey were with one glaring exception,\nICSMU.\nNot one of the elected ICSMU representatives was there, including thc sabbatical president Wade Gayed. It is outrageous that someone who is paid to\nrepresent thc students of the Medical\nSchool should not turn up to a meeting\nof such importance or at least manage to\nsend a representative from the Union (or\nhave they all resigned?). Perhaps they\nwere all at the ULU Medical Council meeting being held that evening at St. Mary's? To my amazement I then returned to\nMary's to find myself one of only three\nICSM representatives present at this meet-ing.\nUnfortunately for thc students of\nICSM, this is not a one off fuck up, it is just\nthe latest in a long line of botches including poorly run elections, hustings that\ndon't happen be a cu as e they haven't been\nadvertised, highly te spec ted members of\nthe exec resigning in disgust at the way\nthe union is run, and sorely needed financial reserves that are lost in ill thought out\nsocial events. This is compounded by the\nfact that there has been no General Meeting held this term for the President and his\ncommittee to be held acc countable for\ntheir actions. In fact it would seem that\nthe President is more accountable to the\nMedical School hier achy than the students he represents.\nTeething problems' is a much used\nphrase used to try and explain these problems, but the fact is that the President\ninherited a strong Union f tom last year\nand a good committee elected to serve\nthis year. The President has now been in\nhis job for six months and if there are\nteething problems then il is time he\nstopped acting like a second rate social\nsecretary and started acting like a sabbatical president and worked his butt off\ntrying to sort them out rather than relying\non feeble excuses. If he has tried and\nfailed to overcome these problems, then\nperhaps it is time to admit defeat and\nresign, rather than let the cut rent state of\naffairs continue.\nPerhaps il is now time to see some\naction.\nYours sincerely,\nAndy King\nWords Lost for Linux\nDear Ed\nI recently asked you to put a sentence in\nFelix's In Brief Section drawing attention\nto a new society at Imperial, the Linux\nUser's Group.

After winning our league\nconvincingly (six from six with a+259 points difference) we needed a play-off\nwin to make it to the Southern First Division. We were drawn away against a teacher-training poly from Plymouth,\nwhich meant a9o 'clock departure from\nSouth Ken (except for our late comers -Chris Eubank and John Barnes).\nOut arrival in Plymouth was behind\nschedule, which gave us under thirty\nminutes to change and warm up. A \"Mexican Raah\" that was instigated by\nour newly elected vice-captain - Pharaoh\n- tried to switch us on early. Unfortunately it wasn't enough.\nAfter kick-off and the first few ruc ks we\nsoon realised the increase in the level of\nour opposition. The pack managed to\ntake the game to them, which resulted\nin a couple of early penalty chances that\nproved very close, but the awkward wind\ndid nothing to help Chris Dickinson's boot. Martin made use of the wind to\nRugby SPONSORED BY UniLever\n2nd XV\nplay most of the first half in our half,\nresulting in a well worked blind-side try\nfor the opposition. Suddenly at 8-0 down\nwe had to up a gear and started to play\nour kind of rugby. Deep in our own half\nDave Hogg released a perfect miss ball\nwhich found a huge gap for Dave Gol,\nin turn putting the full-back, Chris Dickinson, in position to give Segun a try scot-ing opportunity he wasn't going to\nrefuse. The converted try saw IC come\nback 8-7.\nThe next ten minutes were to be crucial,\nas going ahead before half time was all\nIC wanted. The forwards gave it their all.\nThe scrum s started to come together as\nIC pushed the opponents back on several occasions. The will to win started to\ncome. This was proven by our second\nrow, with Will Sterns accepting a more\nthan healthy helping of shoe pie. A couple of good runs from IC's blind-side\nflanker, Nippy, was to no avail, as he still\ninsists in passing it to the other side.\nThe Club Captain should know our own\ncolours by now! Half time arrived, and\nwith IC only one point down, belief was\nstill high - although a lot of work would\nstill be required in the last forty minutes\nto bring victory their way.\nThc second half started in a blaze of\nglory, with IC pushing the southerners\nback in jo their five-metre line. However,\nsloppy play gave them a penalty, which\nwas kicked to touch, casing thc pressure.\nAfter a blatant piece of obstruction by IC's no 6, we conceded a penalty close to the\nhalf-way line. Repeated back chat from\nthe players resulted in the ref marching\nus back onto our line. The penalty kick\nwas taken and they went further ahead.\nThis was the turning point of the game,\nas IC never managed to regain form and\nconceded two further cores over the\nnext twenty minutes.\nWith time running out, IC battled on with\nsome aggressive play from Dan Uiguzi\nand Willis. However, it was not to be, and\nthe game finished 18-7 against IC. The\nopportunity of promotion was missed\nand IC will have to tty again next season,\nwhere a home fixture will give the clear\nadvantage. At thc end of the day nobody\nis bitter - they come out with a teaching\ndiploma and 10K for the rest of their\ncareer, whilst ourselves, well...\nIC 15-20 St Marks, St Johns\n& Some farmers\nAfter stamina sapping four hour ride\nwe were ready for action. During the\none minute before play wc shook our\nbones in the salty sea air. Twenty minutes of persistent probing tested the\ndepth of our defence. Eventually the\nPlymouth seamen spurted through a tight gap to score between thc uprights.\nThe score at half time was 10-0.\nFluid ball skills at the start of the second\nhalf resulted in deep pen etta tion of the\nbarrage of fishy men, with Jan diving\nbetween the posts to score the first\nmouth-watering try. Ten minutes later\nand ten more points deeper down, we\ncreated a shower of flowing rugby,\nallowing flo to go down on the brown\ngoal. Dick Seepings shot from the sc tum and was all ove t thc opposition scrum-half. Towards thc end of the second\nperiod Bully's gash was re-opened and\nhe was blood-binned. Substitutions\ncaused the backs to rearrange their positions. The backs then called a six two\nnine, providing Flo with the opening to\nbend in behind thc pins and ram home\nour final climactic effort.\nUnfortunately, victory, the ultimate\nhoney-pot, was unobtainable, so we\nhad to settle for second-best.

    "content": "16 December 1998\nFeature 27\nWhat's Up There?\nRichard Hopkins takes a light-hearted look at practical astronomy you\ncan enjoy this Christmas\nYou've eaten too many mince pies, are\nfed up with hearing about Uncle Jeff's Loft conversion, and all your friends have\ngone off skiing. What now? Don't despair! If the sky is clear, and you're\nstuck for things to do over the Christmas\nbreak then take a trip outside one night.\nThe winter is the best time of year to go\nstar gazing. The cold weather makes the\nsky very clear (assuming there are no\nclouds of course!), as water condenses\non tiny ait borne particles (like smog and\ndust haze), and they are literally washed\nout of the sky. Also, the short winter\ndays mean that the nights are both long,\nand very dark. These things allow fainter\nobjects to be seen, and many more stars\nbecome visible.\nSo, what can you expect to see, and\nwhat equipment will you need? The\nanswers are: lots, and just your eyes!\n(And perhaps some binoculars as well).\nSome of the constellations, approximate\ntimes, and approximate directions to\nlook are outlined below.\nOrion-The Hunter\nThis beautiful constellation is easily\nrecognised by the 3\nstars that make up\nOrion's belt. Look\nSE any time aft et19:00. Just next to\nOrion, you will find\nhis trusty dog, Sirius, the 'Dog Star'.\nThis is the b tightest star in the sky, and twinkles all sorts of\npretty co louts due to refraction in thc\nEarth's atmosphere.\nThe Plough (or Saucepan)\nHandy one this if you get over enthusiastic about your star gazing and get lost\nin the middle of the night. The two end\nstars away from the 'handle' of the\nsaucepan point towards the pole star\n(North)..Look for the plough low down\nin thc NE, at any time of night.\nCygnus - The Swan\nThe constellation looks like a cross, and\nlies in the middle of the Milky Way, pointing along it. Look for it in thc west in thc\nearly evening.\nCassiopeia\nThis constellation looks like a slightly\nbent 'W. It is also in the Milky Way. Use\nthe second 'V shape to find the Andromeda Galaxy, find it high up in the west,\nin the evening.\nLeo - The Lion\nThis constellation looks like a trapezium,\nbut thc darker the sky, thc more stars in\nit become visible. No matt et how dark it\nis though, it still doesn't look like a lion,\nfind it low down in the east after 22:30\nOther naked eye objects visible\ninclude...\nThe Milky Way\nThis stretches tight act oss thc sky, all\nnight. It passes through the constellations\nof Cygnus and Cassiopeia. On a dark,\nmoon-less night, it can't be missed and\nis a beautiful sight, forget seeing it in\nto nd on though, the sky isn't dark\nenough!\nThe Andromeda Galaxy\nThis object\nis quite\nfaint. Look\nfor Cassiopeia, and\nthen follow\nalong the\nline that the second V is pointing. If\nyou are lucky, then nearby you will see\na faint fuzzy object in the sky. Congratulations, the light you are seeing left the\ngalaxy 2.2 million years ago!\nThe Pleiades\nThis is a star cluster, and contains many\nyoung, blue, stars. Most people can see\nat least 4 of them, but some can sec\nmore (there are seven bright ones,\nhence the popular name of 'Seven Sisters'). A look at them through binoculars\nreveals many more. Look any time in\nthe evening, roughly south, and quite\nhigh. At a fit st glance, the cluster looks\nlike a smear, but a careful look reveals\nthat it is in fact many stars very close\ntogether.\nThe Planets\nJupiter and Saturn can be seen in the\nevening, quite low, in thc south. They arc\nboth very bright, and don't twinkle like\nstats, lor the real enthusiasts (or party-goers!), Mars is also visible in the south-cast, but not until 3 in thc morning.\nTowards the end of the holiday, Venus\nwill be visible in the evening, just after\nthe sun has gone down, and near by. It\nis very bright.\nThe Moon\nfull on the 3rd of\nDecember and\n2nd of January.\nNew on the 19th of December\nand 17th of January. If you want\nto see the Milky\nWay, and other faint objects, go when\nthe moon is nearly new, because then\nthe moon is small, and sets early in the\nevening (or gets up late at night), and\nthis makes the sky much darker.\nMeteors\nCan happen any time, any place! I hey\nare usually quite rare - you might see one\nor two an hour if you are lucky. There will\nbe ever so slightly more than normal\naround thc New Year.\nSatellites\nIhe most common satellites are spent\nrocket boosters and other junk - only a few things orbiting the Earth actually do\nanything useful. They move across thc\nsky in about 10 minutes, and can be\nbrighter than stats.\nDo try lo have a look outside, weather\npermitting. Out wrap up warm, and take\na friend to chat to, or you'll end up spending all night there just gazing! If you have\nan in ler esl in astronomy then join\nAstrosoc!

Luckily\nfor you, Close Combat 3 re-creates the\ncampaign on your PC, in thc comfort of\nyour own home. This may be the only\ncomfort you get from the game though...\nH Taking the role of either nation,\njj j one can opt for single 'historical'\n!!'\u2022 \u2022 J lli' more a i duo us cam-..v; Miens it\\; i \u2022,(!\nselect your troops from a central\npool and fight from 1941 to 1945\nwith troops, tanks and support units\navailable at that time - so no Tiger\ntanks for Barbarossa, This combined\nwith the promotion idea, allowing\nyou to command more troops the\nmore missions you complete, adds\npurpose to thc campaigns. Warfare is\nconducted from the top-down perspective tinged with a little 3Di some try, setting the scene fot what could be a good\nreal-time strategy game - although thc\ngame-play unfortunately does not live up\nto its potential. At least we can blame\nMicrosoft...\nThe background map graphics are\nplain yet satisfactory, but thc units arc a little small which leads to confusion as to\nwhich are yours. If you 'zoom' in to try\nto rectify this problem you arc confronted\nwith thc nightmare of blocky low-reso-lu tion graphics (Aaarrgh!). Gunfire\nexchange is surprisingly lame considering the brutality of the real war, although\n\u00ab1* \"\nyou do get to hear the death cries of\nwounded soldiers in both German and\nRussian - or tng li sh if you prefer.\nAltogether, the game bases itself\nstrongly on the strategic approach, without immersing the player in the atmosphere of chaotic madness found in real\nwar, and on this it falters. If you're a patient die-hard strategy fan, or are looking for a history lesson, you may be\nmore sympathetic.\nViv\nMusic (PSX)\nCodemasters\nMusic is not a game. You should be clear\nabout this from the start. It is the most\nserious piece of software I have ever\nexperienced on the Playstation. In\nessence it is a music and video creation\nsystem, complete with a16 track editing and mixing system twinned with\na3D video generator.\nThere is a vast array of samples to\nchoose from including vocals, per-cus sion, kick drums and loads more.\nAll the samples are placed under five\nheadings of ambient, drum and bass,\nhouse, techno and trip hop. I found\nthe huge selection overwhelming at\nfirst, leading to a great deal of testing\nof which sounds mixed together well,\nhowever at times samples you would\nexpect to find under a certain category are not there at all. for example,\nunder trip hop I went to look for some\nsmart chilled out vocals and instead I found a choice of extremely full sounds,\nmuch more like house.\nIf you are of the more creative persuasion there is a riff creator which is\nlinked to a library of over 3000 stored\nsounds and samples, and it allows you to\nmould each sound into your own particular flavour.

After some editorial difficulties last year (something\nabout unacceptably offensive jokes),\nthere will be a new magazine out for January's RAO week, Drunken Swine '99.\nAt least, there will be a Ragmag if I can collect enough material to fill it, and\nthat's where you come in. Jokes, car-toons, stories, amusing (short) articles\nand the like; The Ragmag has a long tradition of printing anything it can get\naway with.\nPlease send anything to i c_rag mag@hotmail.com or drop it into the\nRAG office - up the stairs at the back of\ndB's, or through the UDH. There should\nbe a box up outside the office for con-tri but ions. The mag will be on sale\nthroughout RAG week, for of a small\ndonation. All the proceeds from the\nRagmag go to RAG's five charities; Shelter, Imperial Cancer Research, Avert, Trinity Hospice and IC Community Action\nGroup.\nLilley visits Consoc\nConsoc almost reached the top of the\nparty hierarchy with their latest guest,\nPeter Lillcy. He is the deputy leader of\nthe opposition and formerly held a position as minister for social security.\nLilley made substantive efforts to\nconvince the audience that a single currency is not simply an economic project\nbut a political one and a single currency\nmay be the instigator of political coal i tion. He spoke of the economic consequences for the UK and said that we\nneed not be bullied into a single currency by virtue of being situated next to\na large trade area working in Euro's, quoting Canada and America as an\nexample.\nJerusalem Day\nThe new BMS building was host to the\n'Jerusalem Day' organised by the Islamic\nSociety on Wednesday 25 November. The\nevent was aimed at raising awareness and\nappreciation of the rich heritage of\nJerusalem as a holy city for Muslims and followers of the other monotheistic religions,\nand the current changes to the identity of\nthe city.\nIt was presented by Mr Alistair Duncan,\nfreelance photographer and writer. The history of the city, as seen from its arch it ec ture, was characterised by variety and\npluralism, thriving particularly under Muslim rule. The last part of the event was a talk by Dr Daud Abdullah, senior researcher\nat the Palestinian Return Centre. Dr Abdullah gave a summary of the main steps in\nthe ongoing development of the architecture, population and identity of the city.\nReferee!\nNew legislation in Birmingham could\nspell the end for students' drunken\nexploits and bring a new meaning to the\nwords 'You 're off. West Midlands police\nare introducing a yellow card system to\ncurb inebriated students in the pre Christmas weeks. Any behaviour judged to be\nirresponsible will result in a yellow card,\nessentially a letter of complaint to the\nstudent's home. If the student is caught\nagain a red card will result and the Un\nvers it y will be notified. The relationship\nbetween local residents of South Kensington and Imperial College students\ncould be deemed strained at the least,\nbut there are hopefully no plans for such\na system to be introduced at Imperial\nMinibus Update\nFelix would like to clarify some points\nconcerning the minibus incident on 22\nNovember, as reported in last week's issue ('Fellwanderers fall victim to\nminibus fault', issue 1129). The minibus\nin question had in fact been looked over\nby a mechanic on the day before the\nclub hired it, and had passed a road test\nperformed by the garage. The bus was\nthus hired out by the Union in what was\nassumed to be adri v able condition.\nThe exact cause of the accident, in\nwhich \"wobbly\" steering caused the driver to lose control and career across the\nhard shoulder of the M1, remains\nunknown at the time of going to press.\nWhat is known, is that one of the tyres\nwas flat when the emergency services\narrived at the incident. The insurers are\ncurrently inspecting the bus to find the\ncause of the accident. If the steering\nwas indeed faulty, questions will have to\nbe raised concerning the competency of\nthe garage that performed the road test\nand inspection before the fell wanderers set out.\nTop Marks From Europe*\nAccording to the lead story in the rep\nu table German weekly news magazine\nDCY Spiegel, IC comes out extremely\nwell in a special league table for engi\nnee ring courses. Overall, Imperial was\nranked in joint second place (tying with\nOxford and Cambridge), with the Dutch\nuniversity of Eindhoven being awarded\nthe top position.\nIn this survey of European Higher\nEducation institutions which carried the\ntitle Uni-Test Europa, Imperial was par\nti cula rly successful in the categories of j 'academic expectations', 'personal con\nt acts and advice' and 'access to com-put ers'. The language courses available\nwere also singled out as especially com\nmc nd able. Weird Wide World Interesting facts from around the globe\nBy Andy Brown\nBeer Bladder\nThe greatest volume of beer drunk\nbefore going to the toilet was 45 pints\nof various weak lagers by George\nWingfield between 12:15pm and\n2:38pm on 22 December 1986. On the\nsame day he set the record for the\nlongest urination: 36 minutes 24 seconds in a newsagent's doorway. He\nwas arrested and charged with a public order offence after 17 minutes, but\nthe police had to wait a wee while\nbefore they could take him back to the\nstation!\nThe Beauty Within\n\"There are far too many pretty women\nin the government offices at the\nmoment, distracting male workers and\nlowering bus in es efficiency with their\npert and yielding tightness. We must\nbe ever watchful for possible immoral\nactivities, and it is well know that pretty\nwomen cause unhealthy activities that\nlead to insanity, blindness, sickness\nand bends. That is why from now on\nthorough ugliness must be considered\na deciding factor at all job interviews.\nSince the prettier candidate has\nalready been blessed by God it is only\nright that we should hire the uglier\none.

However, a fraction of a second\nearlier he had attempted to kill himself\nby throwing himself from the top of a ten-storey building - but he was shot as\nhe fell past the ninth storey window.\nSuicide? The coroner thought not, as his\nattempt would have been thwarted due\nto a safety net erected for window clean-ers. The shotgun was fired from a room\noccupied by an elderly couple, where\nthe husband regularly threatened his\nwife w th a shotgun - although he swore\nthat it was never loaded. He got so\nupset that he pulled the trigger, but\ncompletely missed his wife and shot\nOpus through the window. If one\nintends to kill someone, but accidental y kills someone else instead then, theo-rect ic ally one is still guilty - he had murdered Opus.\nFurther investigation found a witness who saw the couple's son loading\nthe gun about six weeks earlier after his\nmother cut off his financial support.\nKnowing his father's habit of using the\ngun threateningly, he loaded it in the\nhope that his father would shoot his\nmother, thus making himself responsible for the death of Ronald Opus. However, the son became depressed over\nthe failure of his attempt to engineer his\nmother's death so he threw himself\nfrom the top of a ten-storey building,\nonly to be shot in the head with a shotgun as he fell past the ninth floor. A case of suicide was recorded.\nSex Shop Scandal\nThe owner of a sex shop in Rouen,\ntrance, placed a list of debtors in his\nshop window - all accounts were settled\nwithin two days.\n\n"

    "content": "12 Arts 16 December 1998\nROSEMARIE TROCKEL\nWhitechapel Art Gallery\nT his show, entitled Bodies of Work\n1986-1998, is the first retrospective\nof Rosemarie Trockel's work in\nBritain for over a decade since her\nfamous and critically\nacclaimed i:\\hi bi lion \u2022 ' \u2022\nat the ICA. She was\nrecently selected to\nrepresent Germany at\nthe 1999 Venice Biennale.The collection is\nvery large with a total\nof seven rooms,\neach one having a particular theme. The\nfirst room is full of\nphotos and a video\nthat explore the relationships between\nlovers. Most of the\nwork is in black and\nwhite, making it very\nintimate. Beauty, the\nonly colour print, portrays ten women\nwith beautiful long hair and one man\nwith very short hair, finally, the video is\ndisplayed in an enclosed area. The screen\nis divided up in two, with a couple in\neach section. They are having a conversation but most of the sentences arc in\ndifferent languages, as they repeat the\nwords of Warhol, Freud, Bachmann and\nMarguerite Duras. The overall idea is\nvery bizarre but\nsomehow Trockel\nj; pulls it off.\nThe next room\nis the oddest of the\nwhole exhibition-all\nIII the works here have\nsomething to do\nwith eggs. Fgg wall-paper, curtains and\nshells used as ash-trays. Trockel has\n111 come up with very\nimaginative ideas\nthat have a lovely\nmagical touch to\nthem. Another room\nexplores the sea; a\"5* very clever sculpture\nmade of seashells and a poetic installation of a boat with slides about fisher-men's lives projected on the sail to\nbrilliant effect. The following room is a very different take on wool and Plexiglas;\nit includes some very funny foam and\nwool balls hanging from the ceiling, then\nwe're presented with a set of sketches\nand drawings, some about Jackie\nKennedy. Trockel als\nwithin the same wor\nment s of drawing and\nto graph y. In other plac\nshe takes a plaster he a as a model anc\nsketches different\nangles of this same;\nhead using charcoal.

It is\nmuch more rewarding to consider each\nroom separately for its quality or imagination and then just sit back and admire\nRosemarie Trockel's art as a whole. This\nis one of the most exciting and challenging exhibitions I have seen for a while, with the artist involving the spectator tremendously. She also manages\no ultra; I a very large audience\nr se of the excitement\nthe humour of her\nor k. Eclectic artists\nalways end up being\nluminaries of their time.\nWe can only hope that\nTrockel will continue\nreceiving the credit\nand acclaim she so\nobviously deserves.\nyou:' ever seen a bronze\n\u2022 \u2022 seal hanging upside\nIP down from the ceiling\ny with blond artificial hair\nund its neck?\nUntil 7th February\nNearest tube: Aldgate East\nAdmission: FREE\nOpening hours: daily except Monday\n11am5 pm(8 pm on Wednesday)\nMACBETH\nUnion concert Hall\nT he plight of the ill-fated Macbeth\nwas played out last week by IC's drama society. The great Shakespearean tragedy placed the new promoted Thane of Cawdor in a self-inflicted\nworld of deceit and treachery, with an\nominous web of prophecy contracting\nand eventually consuming the floundering warrior.\nDirector Simon Myatt attempted to\nhighlight various elements of the play for\nthose of the technological persuasion,\ndispensing with the legendary three\nwitches in favour of a suited trio sounding out their divination s. In a bold move,\nthe director explained he had \"discarded\nsome of the original themes of the play,\nmost notably the belief and influence of\nwitchcraft\". Shakespeare masterfully\nemployed the pernicious, yet ubiquitous\nsupernatural presence as a linking thread\nthroughout the play, consequently the\nwitchcraft is one of the underpinning\nissues and it was clear the play merely\nsuppressed rather than removed this\ncharacteristic. The director \"tried to compensate by bringing in some new\nthemes\" which were not immediately\napparent due to the script's integrity to\nthe original drama, but manifested themselves in the staging.\nFrom the opening scene the cellular\nphone used by one of the 'witches'\nestablished the shift from Jacobean regal-it y to executive official it y. Although to\nsome extent, it was eerie seeing the\ngood King Duncan sitting at a desk in a pin-stripped suit writing next to a phone,\nthis peculiarity soon fades as the subtly\nupdated script develops. The innovation\ndid not stop there, with Duncan's heir\nMalcolm being played by a female. This\npoint was not labour ed, but simply pre-the production. The pallid business clothing complemented the drama's sinister\nundertones, while alluding to the\nwearer's elevated social status.\nPiet Mondrian's interpretation of\nTrafalgar Square was the constant backdrop for the play, firmly yet subconsciously linking all that took place before\nsent ed to the audience for their perusal\nand acceptance. Often 'Shakespeare a la\n1990s' productions have a tendency to\nengross themselves in risky convoluted\ninterpretation that can mask or detract\nfrom the original power and meaning. In\nthis ease a simple but effective updating\nmethod was adopted that only added to\nit with the contemporary. It added strong\nflashes of colour to an otherwise overcast\nstage.\nThe skillful use of lighting breathed\nlife into the production. The dominance\nof the dark, contrasting with the startling brilliance of the light simulated the\nintrospective conflicts of Macbeth as well\nas his wife. It showed how the pretence\nof their public life, which often took\nplace in the light was slowly decaying\ninto the darkness of their private misery.\nThis imagery was consummated with the\nselection of music; tracks like 'Over' and\n'Half Day Closing' from Portishead's second album, the play's inspiration, filled\nthe Union Concert Hall with the malevolence of Macbeth as he invests all his\nefforts into escaping the prison of\nprophecy.\nThe performances were for the most\npart sound, with particularly strong interpretations from King Duncan who did\nappear master of all he surveyed and\nLady Macbeth who captured the char-act er's colossal descent from single-minded ambition to an almost pitiful\nneurosis. Macbeth was far more convincing as the hallucinogenic malcontent\nrather than the all-conquering jubilant\nwarlord.\nThe play presents its material well,\nleaving the audience with a heartfelt\nsense of sorrow although it fails to draw\nthem into the iniquitous world of Shakespeare's hero and so much of the emotion is lacking. The directing is highly\nintelligent in places and heightens its\nimpact. Along with the understated contemporary dimension, the production\nprovides a laudable education.\nAndy\n\n"

Dull, dull, dull.\n16 December 1998 Film\nRound-up\nROUND-UP\nof the year award\nthe Odeon Kensington\nTHE TRUMAN SHOW\n\"Mi\nany reviewers have focused on The\nTruman Show as a dramatic turn\naround in Jim Carrey's career - proof\nthat he really can cut it as a serious actor. This creates the impression that this is a masterpiece of\nmodern film-making, a serious moral drama investigating the power of TV. Yet this simply isn't true -The Truman Show is a brilliant example of near perfect film making, but for different reasons.\nFirst of all, forget any film made in the last twenty\nyears. Truman has far more in common with the Hollywood of the thirties and forties than the mega-bucks\nmethods of today. Think back to the days of Cary\nGrant and James Stewart and classic feelgood movies\nlike It's A Wonderful Life, and you're in the right kind\nof territory.\n.Above all, it's Carrey's showcase performance\nthat drives the film towards classic status. Amidst his\nutterly unreal surroundings, he manages to remain\ntotally believable, an average, everyday guy, struggling to discover the truth of what's going on around\nhim, never daring to believe the full nature of the corporate universe that surrounds him. Not only every\nscene he appears in, but the entire movie revolves\naround his performance and ultimately relies on him\nfor its success.\nThe relative successes of The Truman Show and\nsome of this Summer's all-action outings should\nfinally send the message to Hollywood that well\nthought out, well written movies can be successful.\nOK, so this time next ye at we'll probably have to put\nup with an endless stream of Truman rip-offs, but\nmaybe-just maybe-the unlikely combination of Weir\nand Carrey could herald the return of old-style values\nto movie-making. Quite simply, that's how good this\nmovie is. Cliched as it may be, I feel compelled to say\nit : If you only see one movie this year, then make\nsure it's The Truman Show. } 9\n(Fxcerpts from Felix 11211\nWei\nLA Confidential\nThe best thriller of the year, mixing corrupt police and\nprostitutes who look like movie stars into a classic\nthriller.\nStarship Troopers\n[The best B film of the year.

Now in my\nreview I am glad to say I don't disagree\nwith the fact that these stories are very\ngood and of a different style than I am\nused to reading, which makes me feel\nbetter and restores some faith in my literary appreciation skills!\nThe title story of this collection is a good example of the hidden depths of\nthese stories, with their insightful dia-logue, usually written in the first person\ndescribing relationships between men\nand women, the emotions and differences of opinions between both, which\nis clearly a recurrent theme.\nCarver writes as either a lonely,\ntired housewife or a self-centred travelling salesman in situations that otherwise would seem benign, but there\nis always an element of intensity and\ndarkness in each story which makes it\nmemorable and in some cases quite\ndisturbing. There is, however, demonstration of a wry sense of humour\nlinked to Carver's observations of\nhuman behaviour which made this collection entertaining and light in places.\nPerhaps one of the more disturbing\ntales is 'Tell the Women We're Going'\nwhich is in effect an account of a man,\nBill, who ends up being witness to his\nchildhood friend, Jerry, killing two\nwomen randomly after what started as\nan unplanned drive along the highway\nto get away from their wives and children at home. Throughout, it offers little explanation and doesn't reveal the\nhorrible outcome until the last paragraph of its nine pages; \"He never knew\nwhat Jerry wanted. But it started and\nended with a rock. Jerry used the same\nrock on both girls, first on the girl called\nSharon and then on the one that was\nsupposed lo be Bill's.\" The abrupt endings remind me of\nthe X Files (excuse the comparison!)\nwhere even though it can be irritating\nnot to know the actual outcome and\nconsequences, it is still addictive and\nenjoyable, with the darker side of ourselves being strangely satisfied.\nThe stories evoke emotion and\nintrigue and in general I appreciated\nCarver's real sense of people and life\nand interpretations of relationships.\nThis is certainly worth a read or\nmaybe more than one, as proved to be\nthe case with me, to pick up on all the\nmessages and to fully appreciate what\nthis collection potentially offers.\nTanya BaqaL\nThe Tesseract\nby Alex Garland\nViking Books, \u00a39.99\nTake six cubes and arrange them\ninto the shape of a crucifix. Take\ntwo more cubes and stick them\neither side of the crucifix, at the point\nwhere the cross is made. Now you\nhave a tesseract. A tesseract is a four\ndimensional object - a hypercube\nunravelled.\nIt isn't necessary to understand this\ndefinition to read the book (thank God)\nbut this defines Garland's latest novel\n- and in case you are wondering, it\nisn't an origami book. The Tesseract is\nnot just one story but several which initially seem as far removed from each\nother as stories can be. It is a true 'Pulp\nFiction' style book in the way that the\nbook hops from one storyline to\nanother with no apparent initial connections between them. To start with,\nthis can be disconcerting as you just get\ninto one storyline when suddenly a whole new story begins. However the\nlinks between one storyline and the\nnext soon become apparent, just small\ndetails to begin with but enough to\nkeep the reader hooked. Each aspect of\nthe novel is set in Manila with each\ncharacter following their own life completely unaware of the others, but all\nthis is about to change.\nSean is waiting for the arrival of\nDon Pepe in a derelict hotel on the outskirts of Manila, the phone is dead and\nthere are blood stains on his sheets.\nRosa waits for her husband to come\nhome whilst patiently dealing with her\nmother and children. She remembers\nback to her childhood and through her\nmemories, there arc disturbing revelations. Vinccnte is a street kid whose life\nis inexplicably interwoven with that of\na strange man who pays street kids to\nhear their dreams. Three people who\nhave nothing in common but whose\nlives are intricately threaded together\nby the author to end in a grand finale.\nThis is Garland's second novel following his earlier success with \"The\nBeach'. It is a unique style of writing\nand your enjoyment will ultimately\ndepend on your appreciation of this\nstyle. The second storyline is linked to\nthe first and the third to the first and\nsecond before the final chapters reveal\nthe outcome. The novel is undoubtedly well written but I feel it is something that may need to be read several\ntimes before the full impact of the\nnovel hits home. I found there were\nseveral loose ends that didn't quite tie\nin at the end, leaving unanswered\nquestions for the reader, something\nthat could be quite frustrating.\nSo would I recommend this book?\nYes, because I haven't read anything\nquite like it and il certainly has the\npotential to be the next Taratino film\n(perhaps with a little more added vio-le nce).A possible Christmas present\nfor all the family.\nClare Ashwin.\nJingo\nby Terry Pratchett\nCorgi Books\nP ratchet l never erases to\namaze. His latest paper back\nrelease 'j in go' adds to his continuing line of success, and is the\n21st novel in Ihe Discworld\nsequence.

    "content": "46\nSpori 16 December 1998\nFootball\nRSM 1 St XI\nIC 1st XI 4-1 RSM\nThe agony and the ecstasy\nIt has been a memorable week for all\ninvolved in RSM first eleven football.\nLast Wednesday they took part in the first\nall IC premiership clash (even referee\nJames Vallance was an IC student) for\nover six years, as IC firsts entertained the\nRSM massive on neutral ground.\nIt was a bitterly cold afternoon at\nHarlington although both sides were full\nof passion as they knew the importance\nof this grudge match. RSM also knew\nthey needed the points before the Christmas break, otherwise real trouble\nloomed large on the horizon.\nRight from the whistle it was the\nRSM who were making the play although\nIC were looking particularly dangerous\non the counter attack. After half an hour\nthe stalemate was broken from a position well within his own half, centre half\nNik Hardingham unleashed a laser like\npass that instantaneously bisected the IC\nback line and presented centre forward\nDoug Spikes with a golden o pur t unity as\nhe cool y rounded the keeper and drove\nthe ball home to give RSM a deserved\nlead.\nYet in the next five minutes RSM's inexperience was exposed to the full, as\nthey not only surrendered their hard\nearned lead but fell behind with what\ncan only be described as an outrageous\nfaux pas from goalkeeper Mark Dwyer,\nwho gifted IC a second by managing to\nnutmeg himself.\nWith IC throwing men forward the\nRSM defence buckled and RSM went\nfurther behind when a deflected shot\nlanded at the IC centre forward's feet,\nwho made no mistake. RSM's misery\nwas completed when a fourth was\nadded from the outside the box in the\ndying minutes.\nSo yet another defeat and still no clues\nas to when and where this wretched\nrun would end.\nRSM 2 - 1 UCL I The answer was to come the following\nSaturday in a match that has truly put the\ncat amongst the premiership pigeons,\nwhen RSM played host to early premiership leaders UCL in a top versus\nbottom clash.\nWith apparently no transport avail-able, Masefield's band of merry miners\nwent underground in what was yet again\na pantomime fiasco thanks to London\nTransport.\nAfter the match had been reduced\nto 40 minutes per half due to light, UCL\nwere keen to get under way and\nlengthen their impressive unbeaten run.\nFor the first ten minutes it was all hands\non deck for RSM, as a barrage of attacks\nput the mines on the ropes and seemed\nto emphasize the gap in class. However,\nthis 10 minutes was all we would see of\nthe UCL dominance. The RSM penalty\narea suddenly turned into an impregnable fortress, patrolled by a miserly\nforce, who quickly dealt with anything\nthat was thrown at them, five minutes\nlater and the offensive cogs started to\nturn, at first slowly still frightened to play\nagainst league leaders, but soon the\nconfidence snowballed and it was RSM\nwho were running the show.\nChances were beginning to manifest\nas the midfield and wing backs linked\npoetically with the forwards. But could\nRSM make this count? Sure enough\nthey did when a punch drunk UCL\ndefence failed to clear a cross which\neventually Nigel Milner stroked sweetly\nInto the corner of the goal.\nUCL were now in desperate trou-ble, although they knew there was still\nhope. RSM longed for half-time and the\nchance to go into the break one-n ill in\nfront. They completed this objective\nwith the apparent ease of a veteran\ncampaigner.\nThe second half continued where\nthe first half left off. With the midi fc ld overlapping and swamping the UCL goal,\nbut failing to extend the lead.\nThis changed with twenty minutes to\ngo as the midfield sculpted a delightful\nsecond goal in a move that switched\nfrom left to right and left again where\nPatrick Verlaine str uk ca memorable shot\nbeyond the flailing keeper.\n2-0 to the RSM, but no rest for the\ndefence. With 10 minutes left, RSM\nkeeper Nick Perroer commited Hari-Kari\non his debut, giving away an indirect free\nkick only six yards from goal. The free\nkick was converted with style and now\ncould RSM hold on?\nYes. At the final whistle there was much\ncelebration - a fully des revd three points.\nRSM 2nd XI\nLSE V21 RSM II\nFrom the off RSM Samba Crew knew it\nwas going to be a tough match. With the\nref. as old as God and wanting to start\nthe game before we had 11 players out\nof the dressing room, we were up\nagainst it. A mix up outside our box led\nto the first goal for LSE within g5 minutes.\nEncouragement came with our mi de field dominating the game from that\nmoment on. A second goal came after\n25 minutes when their skipper found\nthe corner of the net. It was a cruel blow,\nshortly followed by another as Moony's Knee was bent doubled by an outrageous tackle.\nSwitching majestic to centre forward\nproved a major success, running their\ndefence ragged for the rest of the game.\nWith our defence all over their attack like\nflies on a turd, and the midfield and\nattack Ipaying with skills rarely seen in\nEuropean football, LSE were pul mel led into oblivion for the entire second half.\nRight winger, Briother Barnett, charg in forward before cutting infield to curl a magnificent shot around the keeper. It\nshould have been the start of a rout, and\nmoments later a curling free kick from\nun believe ably named Barry Mguigan,\nwas tipped over the bar. that was to signal the start of the end for the RSM mas-sive.\nAfter the final whistle, their French skipper told me, \"You was robbed, Guv'nor.\nYou 'ad us on the ropes.\"\n6th XI\nICVI 3 - 2 Heythrop I On a cold, windy and wet winter's day,\nIC sixths arrived at sorry excuse for a club house to play on apt ich that had a slope more suited to ski i ers than foot-ball ers, but the scene was set for an\nepic struggle.\nPlaying the first half against the slope, we\nhad the majority of play, superb strikes\ncoming form Tom \"the Doc\" Wilson, Big\nAlex, Animesh \"Rivaldo\" Raval and\nRichard \"Wild Thing\" Williams who hit\nthe post from a corner.\nAgainst the run of play Heythrop score\nafter handling of the ball in our penalty\narea. However, we weren't disheartened as a number of chances were created at the other end - just not put\naway.\nThe second half produced infinitely better play form us after a spirited half time\ntalk by the skipper Rob \"the Diver\" Davenport. The equalise r came form a slick\nseries of passes right down the length of\nthe pitch, and a delicate through ball\nform Rob, resulted in Tom being outrageously fouled in the box. He duly\nunleashed a thunderbolt that meandered gently into the corner. All square\nand all to play for.\nOnce again we were caught with our\njocks down as broke to go 2-1 up, not\neven Chris \"the Hacker\" Haynes could\nstop them. Suddenly it seemed as if they\nmight b come punters in a brothel (sc or ing at will), but after some inspired play,\nPete (who refereed the first half) scored\nfrom a cracking half-volley.\nThere then followed an inspired move.\nDefending a corner, Raval collected the\nball on the edge of our box and with a junkie-in-a pharmacy-like glee, went on\na blistering run, down the pitch until he\ncarved a glorious ball into the path of\nTom, who fins i he d with the coolness of\na snowman's cold bits.\nThe Sixths are back, making IC proud\nwith a couple of wins in the league and\nin our friendlies, we're starting to show\nthe form we've promised form the start.\nCricket\nImperial College Union Cricket Club starts their winter nets on January 18th at Lord's. Would all those in ten e ding to attend the nets please remember to bring their whites,\nand any equipment they have, back after the Christmas vacation. Whites are compulsory at Lord's, so those without may want to stick them on their Christmas lists,\nwe are intending to tour Barbados this year, with many places still to play for and\nwith the final squad being selected at the end of the net sessions. I would also\nparticularly like to invite all medics to join ICUCC this season. ICSM does not enter\na team into ULU and thus all the medics are eligible to play. Indeed many medics\ndo currently play for ICand are heavily involved with the running of what has been\na very successful club in recent years. Anyone interested in playing for ICUCC who\ndid not sign up at Fresher's Fair can e mail me at jc a2@ ic.ac.uk. Jon Ainsworth\n\n"

OT A I pi inn oc Ti-lP X/C ADDA|I TUC CCOTOVITIAI TI IMCC r \u00bbC OO\n/Album of the Year Tue nis&lv a afi on of Uur/t WW\nOne of the most anticipated albums of the year finally\ndrops, and thc first thing I noticed was that, like fellow\nJersey native Queen Latifah, this is an album that is part\nhip hop and part out-and-out R&B, with some songs\nbeing a mixture of both. Thc accent is ta the t on R&B with a pinch of hip hop... be warned.\nThe album is based loosely around some class-room\nskits, questioning the meaning of love, the different\nforms of which are the main subject matter of this\nalbum. The set kicks off into the harsh rag ga influenced tones of \"Lost Ones\", which is softened with the\nsung chorus. Throughout the album, where you would\nexpect a guest rapper or singer to appear, Lauryn Hill\ntakes care of it herself, switching effortlessly from one\nform to the other. The sparse beat of \"Lost Ones\"\nallows L Boogie to display her thoughts, and some say\nthat this barrage is aimed at Wyclef (who is noticeably\nabsent on this album, as are the rest of the Refugee\nCamp), although she has denied this.\nA song such as \"Ex-factor\" begins with a Wu-Tang\nsample, but this is soon forgotten as the song builds\nup and the chorus \"care for me, care for mc, i know you\ncare for me, there for mc, there for me, said you'd be\nthere for me, cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die\nfor me, give to me, give to me, why won't you live for\nme\" is so touching and heartfelt, and as the song ends\nwith an elegant guitar solo, you can't help but feel for\nher.\nHer parenthood is obvious on \"To Zion\" where her\nvoice soars as she sings happily about her love for her\nson over a string laden track. Thc way she sings here\nis so moving that you can't help but sec how her son\nhas changed her life, and he is the main focus for her.\nThe single \"Doo wop (That Thing)\" is one lh at is likely\nto do well in the pop charts without being a straight up\npop song as it contains a message warning men and\nwomen to watch out for thc opposing sex. Thc amalgamation of the rapped verses followed by the sugary\nsinging of the hook over a track full of horns and that\nsimply nagging piano leads to a result that will be\nhuge everywhere: on the radio, in the club, worldwide.\nGreat to see something like this. Lauryn showing people what is happening without them realizing it.\nThere are many other good songs. \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\" could be a look at herself, \"forgive\nThem Father\" with the chorus \"forgive them father, for\nthey know not what they do\" could be an enlightened\nlook, or can come off preachy. Retro-soul is combined\nwith a distinct 90s feel, breathing new life into songs\nlike \"EveryGhetto, Every City\". \"Superstar\" is another\nquality R&B/ rap combination without sounding clich e. The hook \"Come on baby, light my fire/Everything you\ndrop is so tired/Music is supposed to inspire/How\ncome we ain't getting no higher?\" is a poignant look\nat the state of music nowadays. Even though Lauryn\ncrafts an album to her high standards, she latches on\n\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\" at the end, although\nhidden, it is easily found and is in a similar vein to \"killing\nMe Softly\", in that it will have major commercial rota-tion. Even so, this album is a glimpse into the mind of\nLauryn Hill, a very personal look at times, and while it\ndoes not extend thc boundaries of hip hop or R&B, it\nis a great collection of songs featuring her unique\nvoice that cats have been fi ending for since day one.\nThe wait is over.\nRoni\nWhats up boys and girls, its the last issue of this year,\nbut don't worry we will return in thc new year to con-tine giving you your shot of R&B and hip hop. The years\nbeen pretty hectic and th cres been plenty going on in\n98.\nJust wanna give props to all the people who've\nhelped us out, and wish everyone whos reading this a very Merry Christamas and Happy New Year, keep It\nReal!\nMilen\n1999 can u you fucking believe it!!!!!\nPhat Selection of '98\nSweetheart- JD feat.

The\nseething beats kick in for the first song\nHunter, and the backdrop begins to pulsate in an eerie red light. As Bjork sings\n\"I'm the hunter\" and the String Octet\nstrike up the powerful theme, it's clear\nthat the intensive tour has only served to\nshat pen their performances.

The set peaks with\n\\oga where thc Octet are used to their\nfull potential, creating a whirling vortex\nof sound into which Bjork wails \"State of\nemergency, how beautiful to be,\" and il\nis a magnificent end to a superb night of\nmusic.

Light\nseems no longer merely that which illuminates things around\nus. It is li\\ ing, breathing, pulsating, bringing on its own interpretation to things. I cannot judge the distance from my eyes\nto this page. The music is making the light between me anc\nthe paper dance at 150bpm. So begins, and pos sib k ends, a hedonistic weekend\nin Amsterdam. Stepping out of Centraal Station on a Frida\\ ese ning and across Prins Hendrikkade. the icy wind\nhits us moments before the trams. Make no mistake - to\nsur\\i\\e in this citv one must understand two things; trams j and bic v cles. There is a ridiculous number of both of *\nthese emir on mental lv friendly vehicles, and none of\nthem stop for dazed tourists stuck in the middle of the4 road.\nWe find our fellow journalist in Coffeeshop 222, on\nOudezijdsYoorburgwal, in the red light district. Normally we'd In consideration of coffee shops Most people think coffee shops are just smoking dens. Some of\nthem, particularly the ones around the red light district, fulfil this\nstereo tv pe adequately. Wander further afield, however, and\n\\ ou'll find an enormous diversity in decor and attitude. In the first\ninstance, the v are genuinely pleasant cafes, serving good esp res sos, hot chocolate, milk shakes, fruit drinks and often a selection\nof hot and cold snacks. Some of them are well lit, with light pastel colours and a Parisian cafe feel to them. Some of them are\ndark, filled with deep music and spotlights, and look more like\nclubs than cafes. All of them are friendly establishments where\nlocals and drugs-war refugees alike can smoke dope, exchange\nstories, make new friends or simply chill-out.\nThere are a few basic rules of etiquette that, if followed, will\nseparate you from an average tourist, firstly, if you are passing\ntime in a coffee shop without buying any dope, it is polite to buy\nsome drinks every so often. Don't smoke on the streets - many\nDutch people still resent legal is ation, and smoking is generally confined to recognised coffee shops or private residences. The locals\ndon't appreciate loud, hysterical tourists, especially in Ihe more\nchilled establishments, so try to keep the giggling fits und et con-tro l. Coffeeshops are usually quite small and friendly, so be prepared to share a table; you'll be chatting with them in minutes\nanyway.\nAround the red light district...\nAfter spending a few pleasant hours in De Dampkring and The Grasshopper, and meeting the final two members of the team, a quick tour of the red light district seemed in order.\nBased around two canals, Oudezijds Voorburgwal and Oudezijds Achtcrburgwal, this area\ndoes not deserve its reputation as Amsterdam's central attraction. No Dutch people go\nthere and I 've never liked it myself. Still, in the interests of journalism, we set out, walking past scantily-clad women bathed in a seedy red glow, and dark figures continually whispering \"L, speed, coke\" in your ear. If there's one bad trip in this city, you can find it here.\nAt night the con men are out in abundance, playing off the paranoia of stoned tourists for\nthc sake of a few guilders. Never go around Nieuwmarkt on your own at nigh l, and it's best to avoid it altogether if you're under thc influence. Amsterdam can seem quite threatening at night, but it really is no more dod gy than London - being stoned in a dark strange\ncity will always be difficult to handle.\n3o nowhere near the place, but it has the advantage of\na eing next to our abode, the recently opened Bulldog hos-g tel.

We\nater discover that he has been following the Cannabis\nCup, which finished earlier that day, and has foolishly\nugh t and smoked the winning weed. Poor man - it'll\nbe some time before we get sense out of him.\nThc princely sum of f60( about \u00a320) gets us two\nnights in a clean dorm, surrounded by the winter consignment of backpackers, inter-rail ers and general\nwasters from around the world. More will be joining\nour merry band soon, but for now the only course of\naction is to set out for De Dampkring, and the delights\nthat await within.\nThe place is heaving with Americans enjoying the last\nfew hours of this year's Cannabis Cup, but we find our way\n) the bar, and by 1 Jgrammes of Jack Herrcr.\nOnto the mushrooms...\nIt was a mistake.

I remember saying something like \"the pavement's flow-ing; maybe you should navigate...\" And suddenly there\nwas a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full wit\nwhat looked like huge yellow fangs... it was a tram.\nGonzo Journalism aside, Dr Who's Mushroom shop (on|g Kerkstraat) can provide an afternoon of entertainment\nApart from the illegality of it, taking mushrooms and other^\u00a7\ndrugs in England is always going to be dangerous - you never\nknow exactly what you're getting.

    "content": "14 Arts 16 December 1998\nCHOICE: NEW PLAYS BY NEW WRITERS\nRoyal Court Theatre\nI write this with a stomach which feels\nas if it's full of wriggling eels and a head which feels like it's been trampled by a herd of wildebeest, but a deadline is a deadline. My condition has\nnothing whatsoever to do with these\ntwo plays I saw and everything to do with\na heavy drinking session last night.\nThat's the excuses out of the way.\nnow for the review. B22 is a first play by\nRanjit Khutan, founder and editor of The\nSpyce News, the newsletter for Birmingham's black and Asian gay community.\nHe is twenty-two and the play is set in\nB22, an imaginary postcode in Birmingham. The two characters in the play,\nwho are also twenty-two, meet at twenty\nto ten. Do you sense a common theme?\nVery subtle, don't you think? Anyway,\ntwenty-two is Khutan's lucky number.\nThe play is about two friends meeting up\nfor the first time since a brief encounter\nthree years previously. One has been at\nuniversity, the other is now lined up for\nan arranged marriage. So what's the\npoint? Well, the play tries to open a real\ncan of worms - gay issues, arranged\nmarriages, useless arty degrees, the caste\nsystem in Pakistani society etc. etc.\nThe script has a real axe to grind but\nit is well written for a first pia y. There are\nseveral nice touches, such as a moment\nwhen a mobile phone rings - the audience shuffles in collective embarrassment for the criminal. Then to everyone's relief, one of the actors pulls out the\noffending article and it turns out to be\npart of the plot. The script is not helped\nby schoolboy-like acting from the 'back-from-university discovered l was-gay'\ncharacter and the male-male kiss at the\nend shocks no one as it is seen coming\nfrom the first seconds of the play.\nMuch better was About The Boy, the\nstory of Trev, an awkward teenager, Kev,\nhis hard-nosed derivative trading brother\n(pictured left together) and Nev, their\nwidowed father. An outstanding performance from Lee Ingleby as teenaged\nTrev stands out in a witty production that\nhad the whole theatre in stitches. Christopher Ettridge plays the loser father who\nreads railway timetables on the phone for\na living. He epi to mises a mid-life crisis\nstricken figure whom we pray we will\nnever become.\nBetween the laughs a tragic storyline\ngradually builds and builds until the emotional climax seems to ambush you from\nnowhere. For a twenty-year-old, Ed Hime\nhas an exceptional grasp of how to write.\nSeemingly spurious unexplained details\nin the staging, effects and plot gradually\nreveal their significance as the play pro-cee ds. One example is the plaster-cast\nwhich Trev seems to put on and take off\nhis arm for no apparent reason. Later we\ndiscover that he breaks his arm saving his\nfather from a mugger, making the audience realise which sections have been in\nflashback and which sections are 'now'.\nThere is too much good stuff in this play\nto write about. If you only see one play\noutside the mainstream this year (what's left of it) see this one. You won't be disappointed and there is another play\nthrown in to make sure you get your\nmoney's worth.\nlain\nA normal Tuesday night for Pascale\nand Ingrid would start off with\ngood intentions of practical writeups and reviewing lecture notes.\nInevitably, these intentions soon ebb\naway as we get drawn to Le Scandale\nwith the promise of cheap booze and\ncheesy music. But last week was differ-ent. We cunningly managed to avoid\nthe usual routine by arranging to do\nsomething cultural instead. So Pascale\nswapped her platforms for penny-loafers\nand Ingrid her drinking habits for manners as we went on our merry way to the\nRoyal Court Theatre.\nThe four plays that we\nwere due to see were\nv 'new plays by new play\nwriters' ranging from ages\n^ ^ ^ m1626. Namely Sarah Barr\nf lB^f lj(22)( apparently she won'tI get out of bed for less\nI than \u00a33.50), Richard Obcrg\nI(23)( charming, good-look-II ing and from Hull!), Alice\nWood (16) (the youngest\nof the four) and Simon\nStephens (26) (a guy with\nan unhealthy interest in\nfootball, who lives with his\nirl ie,a man called Terry\nand a cat).\nThe first play that we\nsaw was called In The Family; this was Ingrid's particular favourite and was all about the\nreactions of three relatives to the death\nof a family member. Aiden McAndel\n(Paul) and Amelia Lowdell (Teresa) play\nbrother and sister from a poor limb of the\nfamily living in Ireland and Sarah Churm\n(Gabby) the richer counterpart. The actors\nespecially Amelia and Aiden expressed\nbrilliantly the strong emotions of both\nlove and hate toward their cousin. More\nthan this, we cannot say, for the play was\nquite short yet still gripping. We both\nfound ourselves drawn into it to the\nextent that when it was finished it was\nalmost a shock.\nOn a lighter note, the second play\nTrade also showed the diversity of attitudes toward life held by members of the\nsame family. The acting was generally\ngood and Annabelle Apsion gave a particularly amusing performance as a menopausal caf owner/mother of two.\nActor Paul Chequer (pictured left in full\nswing) treated Pascale to the novelty of\na near full monty and Ingrid fancied her\nchances with the lecherous yet poetic\npool owner (Danny Webb).\nThe interval left us both feeling\nsomewhat intimidated following a humiliating experience with some 'proper'\njournalists. Temptation nearly got the\nbetter of us when we were presented\nwith copious amounts of free wine. Nevertheless, we struggled along in our vain\nattempt to appear cultured and made our\nway back into the auditorium.\nThe next play When Brains Don't Countwas similar to the first in the sense\nthat it was relatively short and only had\nthree characters in it. this took us back\nto our years at school because it was\nabout ski ving class and adolescent insecurities. Despite the fact that we at first\nfelt some association with the subject\nmatter, we were disappointed that the\nscript did not do the story-line justice.\nThere were funny moments and the acting was good but it was really too short\nfor either of us to form a strong opinion.\nBy this time, our legs were squashed,\nthe seats felt like concrete and we were\nbecoming increasingly aware of the\nstrange man sitting next to Ingrid. However, the battle for culture had not yet\nbeen won, for there was one more play\nto go. Pascale thought that this was by\nfar the most involving. Ingrid thought\nthat this was by far the longest. Bluebird\nnamed after the Nissan driven by the\nprinciple character in this play was like a series of short but amusing role-plays.\nThis play is based upon how seemingly\ncomical encounters between a taxi driver\nand his 'fares' take on a more sinister\nnote as the story develops and we learn\nmore about the driver's traumatic past.\nThe play is cleverly written yet it becomes\nquite monotonous toward the end as the\nstory line gets repetitive and weak. Basically, by this stage we had had culture\nover-load.\nIn retrospect, we were both glad to\nhave had our theatre 'experience'. Along\nwith excruciating leg cramp, we were\nleft with the memories of a performance\nthat was lacking in some parts and entertaining in others. We would recommend\nit to those of you who are regular the-at re goers and/or aspiring playwrights.\nSo go ahead, do as we have done and\nventure into the vast wilderness of culture - you just might like it!\nPascale & Ingrid\nThe 1998 Young Writer's Festival is running until 19th December\nNearest tube: Leicester Square\nPerformance times: daily 7.15pm and 9pm, tickets: concessions \u00a35 (1 Op standing benches)\n\n"

It\nappears that scientists in Cuba have succeeded in eradicating the killer infection that previously plagued the\npopulation of the island.\nThe team has developed a cure for\nthe strain of meningitis B that infects\n2,000 people each year and kills 200 of\nthose. Thc symptoms appear flu-like,\nbut can rapidly result in death as IC experienced first hand earlier this term with\nthe tragic death of a first year medic.\nThe infection afflicted Cuba in thc\n1980s, when epidemics had a particularly\ndevastating effect amongst children,\nkilling hundreds every year and leaving\nothers crippled or maimed.

Mass im munis ation has resulted in an astounding\ntransformation and the scientists have\nalmost exterminated meningitis B, with\nnow only three cases per million people,\na tenth of the British equivalent.\nAn IC team has been sent to Cuba\nin order to assess the vaccine and the\nimmunity it provides. Their work was featured in last Wednesday's 'Tomorrow's World' programme where Professor Mike\nLevin, Head of Paediatrics, stated \"a British Research team in Havana is currently studying the data gathered on\nresults before and after vaccination, so\nthat only a relatively short time would be\nneeded for tests in this country.\" Thc\nteam, funded by the Meningitis Research\nFoundation, will appraise its pertinence\nin thc development of a British vaccine.\nDr Michael Levin, the UK team leader\ncommented \"All our team working on\nthe intensive care unit would like nothing better than to see another child rid\nof this disease.\" Their results are due for\na1999 release.\nUnfortunately the Cuban vaccine is\nobsolete in Britain as explained by the\nmedical office t for the Meningitis\nResearch Foundation, Linda Glennie: \"In\nthe 1980s Cuba had a big problem with\nmen in go co c cal disease which it appears\nto have solved. The situation in the UK\nis more complicated because we have\nmany different types of B strain. However, we hope that this research project\nwill provide vital clues which will enable\nscientists to develop a vaccine against B strain which accounts for about 60% of\ncases of the disease in this country.\"\nissue 1130\n16 December 1998\nfd it or Ld Sexton\nAssistant Fditor & Films David Roberts\nNews Fditor: Andrew Ofori\nPhotographic Fditor: William tore nz Music td it or s: Jason Ramanathan\nand Dennis Patrir k son Sports Lditor: Gus Paul\nArts Lditor: Helena Cocheme\nGames Lditor: Gary Smith\nClubscene: Giles Morrison\nBooks Lditor: Kent Yip\nPhoto Lditing: Joel few is Delivery Last Issue: David Roberts\nBack Beat Busted CCU dubs Come Home?\nBy Sanjay Sikdar\nSix months of surveillance on the Back\nBeat Club on Denmark Place culminated\nin police storming the notorious drug\nden, on Tuesday 1 December.\nA large proportion of the club's clientele were tourists.

Under the %/t plans that - n. he outlined\nat the meet-ing, all clubs\n(with thc exception of Departmental\nSocieties and mascot ry) would move\ninto the relevant Clubs & Societies Committee. Ptedominantly, this will affect\nCCU sports teams, who would thus move\ninto the Athletics Clubs Committee.\nWhilst C&G, RSM and the RCS only stand\nto lose a handful of clubs between them,\nthe Med School will see a large number\nof clubs, representing a wide range of\ninterests, move out of their control.\nWhilst many of thc CCU reps present\nat the meeting criticised the suggestion,\non thc basis that it would lead to thc\ndiminishing of participation in the CCUs,\nMr Hellard countered that it would lead\nto the strengthening of the clubs, as\nthey would move closer to like-minded\nsocieties; \"It's very hard to compare club\nsuccess and budgets when thay aren't surrounded by clubs with similar inter-est s\". Speaking in response to one del-e gate's suggestion that this p to pos al would only \"punish the best clubs for\nthe behaviour of thc worst\", Mr Hellard\nnoted that \"the CSC system is proven - it\nworks\".\nMr Hellard was\nkeen to\npoint out\nthat this proposal is not\ndesigned to\nalter membership or\nbudgets. Club activity\nneed not\nchange, and\nin fact the\naverage member would not\nnotice any difference; \"It won't change\nthe status of the club in any way - just the\nway they arc administered\".\nWith a lot of work still to do before\nhe can produce any concrete proposals,\nMr Hellard was keen to point out that this\nproposal has only been brought forward\nfor discussion. Nevertheless, it is one\nwhich has awakened very strong feelings\namongst certain CCU figures. Eventually, however, Council finally agreed that\nMr Hellard should return with more solid\nproposals in the new year. Anyone who\nwishes to express their view on the subject should contact Dave Hellard at pre sl dent@ lc.ac.uk.\n\n"

Although this makes good business sense, this\nalbum is probably only ever going to reach those of you who\nare already fans. Saying that, if you are not a Paul Weller fan\nor you think you have never heard of him before I would recommend this to you, as it is so easy to listen to. This would\nmake an ideal Christmas present for that Tm-so-laid-back that l fall-over' person or maybe your Dad.\nJust imagine lying in a park with the sun shining and a cool\ndrink with some music floating in the background. If you can\nimagine this then that is what this album is like. It isn'ta 'Chrlst-mas-y' album but it will bring a bit of sunshine into your otherwise wet, miserable December.\nThis is an extremely mellow album with plenty of cool tunes\nsuch as Wild Wood and Changing Man. It's the sort of music\nyou know you have heard some where but you're not sure\nwhere. The music is that familiar it makes you feel so very com-for table. In total, there are sixteen tracks of pure summer bliss.\nBroken Stones is my personal favourite as it makes me want\nto warble along to my heart's content.\nThese are definitely the greatest hits of Paul Weller so just\nhit the repeat button and relax! CI\n/ lele n THE BLACK CROWES\nBlack Crowes - Horticultural\nexperts, you know.\nT his album has been seen by\nmany people as make-or-break\ntime for The Black Crowes. Their\nfirst two albums, Shake Your\nMoneymaker and The Southern\nIl arm ony Companion, are both regarded as classic bluesy rock albums. Next\ncame Amorica which was mainly\nremembered for it's cover and little\nelse.\nThe worst was yet to come, first the\nband unleashed Three Snakes and One\nCharm, an album that was far too self\nindulgent for it's own good. The gigs in\nsupport of it were even worse,- the band-would simply jam for most of the set with\nlittle in the way of recognisable material.\nFans were starting to worry that weed\nand other substances were starting to\naffect the band. Thankfully this album-suggests that the band's head/arse interface is at an end and they are ready to\nwrite some feel good, southern boogie\nrock once more.\nThe album kicks off with Go Faster\nwhich is an infectious speedy number\nwith a catchy chorus. Next up is Klckln'\nMy Heart Around, the first single taken\nfrom the album, which comes at you at\nthe same pace. Then the band slow\ndown - nothing reaches the pace that the\nopening two numbers set but most of\nthe time you won't even notice it. This\nalbum is filled with hooks and choruses\nthat claw their way into your brain and\nwon't let go. Virtually every song on here\njust makes you want to get up and\ndance. This is a great return to form.\nThat said, not everything is perfect.\nFor starters the vocals veer a bit to close\nto Rod Stewart at times, particularly on By\nYour Side, which may be alright if you like\nthe pseudo-Scotsman but I suspect that\nmany fans won't. It doesn't ruin the\nsongs, though, it merely tarnishes them\nslightly.\nThe other problem is that on Welcome To The Good 7/mes there are hints\nof the band of old - the song being\npretty much a display of how well the\nband can play. This in itself is not a bad\nthing. It's just that the track is too long\nand attention starts to wane. On the\ngood side the arrangements are first class in every song with harmonica, electric\norgan and what is probably a gospel\nchoir really adding to the overall feel. The\nalbum ends with the excellent combination of Go Tell The Congregation and\nVirtue and Vice. The former being one of\nthe best song to end an album that I 've\never heard. This really is a fun party\nrecord. El\nJamie\ni wln k if! Pui& Dli\neee I \u2022 en\nThe Saw- Doctors- e eve;.\n. \u2022 le.\n\u2022 ' .\nI]C1 ii,-:e \u2022 me.'

Although II can't argue with their musical brilliance, the environment of the live experience always seems alien to\nthe music Massive Attack perform. In their own words,\nMezzanine, their last album, fitted into that section of\nlife when you're too tired to party, but too awake to\nsleep - chill out time. So a friday night in Docklands\nwith a six-thirty to eleven o 'clock time schedule and fifteen thousand people didn't quite seem right.\nOn arrival, however, things seemed to look up.\nAlthough in true student style I missed the support acts,\nthe light and sound system was excellent, and there\nseemed to be more gear being, smoked than was\nseized at Backbeat last Tuesday. Nevertheless, some\naspects of the environment were extremely strange.\nHow come the average age in this place is way above\nthirty?? What are all these people wearing suits for?? And\nwhere thc fuck has this fifty year old man in front of\nme got his sexy purple and brown jumper from??\nThen thc music started, and with Angel (the one\nfrom the Adidas advert) Massive Attack blew me away.\nRather than just performing the track as on the\nalbum, Massive Attack belted out a new improved ver-sion, with unabashed emotion and even more incredible dynamics. The rolling bassline boomed around\nthe arena and the eerie vocals began to possess my\nmind. With each crescendo, the effect increased further\nand as the guitar began to swell and distort, I began\nto understand why no arena is too big for Massive\nAttack. I Massive Attack continued with a mix ol el oct re nica and natural instruments so perfect that I was list ii lii g in awe. In the two hour set all the classics came out.\nfrom Blue Lines, their first album, Iht crowd was\nblessed with One Love, Hymn //. >mi he PA] Win o/ and\nthc superb Safe From Flarm, possibly my favourite Massive Attack live track: Tricky or no Tricky. Again, as in\ntheir last tour, Protection didn't feature on thc set-list,\nbut the encore version of Eurochild with interactive\ncrowd light show more than made up for it.\nAnother often-controversial point with Massive\nAttack live is the performance of Unfinished Sympathy,\nconsidered by many to be the greatest dance tune ever.\nYou see, since Shara Nelson and the band parted company thc replacement vocalists have never been able\nto come up with thc goods on this timeless classic.

Their organist Duck informs\nme that they hope to be getting their\nown shows together in the early part of\nnext year - Happy New Year indeed!\nSpace came on the stage to the\ntune of Something Stupid (franks, Nancy\nSinatra) and performed their set in front\nof a large video screen accompanied by\nvideo fool age of, amongst other things,\ncornfield s, planets, satellites and Elvis\nPresley. Much of thc early material was\nnon-single tracks and was s utp rising ly lost on all bar a small minority al the\nfront. However the dazzling lights and\nvideo screen did keep people enter-tai ned. The accompanying light show\nwas spectacular too proving that Space\nreally have come of age in terms of presentation as well as music.\nThc first song to provoke much audience reaction was the hugely popular\nThe Ballad oF Tom Jones. Space were\naccompanied by a pre-recorded Cerys\nfrom Catatonia (bearing a somewhat\nuncanny resemblance to Red Dwarfs\nHolly) on the video screen. Apart from\nThe Ballad oF Tom Jones, the singles\nfrom the albums Spiders and Tin Planet\nwere kept until the latter part of the set.\nIron t man Tommy Scott filled the bits\nbetween songs with we li worn and pre-rehearsed statements that made it all\nlook a bit stale, while the rest of the\nband kept to the back g to und. Latet when the singles started rolling\nthings did improve - the sociopath ic Female of the Species being one of the\nhighlights of the night. Space then dedicated The Unluckiest Man in the World\nto Prince Charles and Avenging Angels\nturned into one large sing along. The\nrecent cover of The Animals We Gotta\nGet out of this Place was similarly well\nreceived.\nIt wasn't until the latte t half of both\nsets that the majority of the crowd\nunfolded their arms, stopped politely\ntapping one foot and generally got into\nthe spirit of things, after all, they had paid\nfor these tickets (unlike myself). Overall\na pretty average performance by Space\nand Straw are definite names for thc\nfuture. El\nKatherine\n\n"

    "content": "16 Christmas TV 16 December 1998\nSimon Baker's Christmas TV Guide\nS her field isn't big enough for\nme. Nor is the European\nUnion. Not content with pronouncing on those two old chest-nuts, my opinions spill over into the\nwo tld of Television, and what bette t time to foist them on you than at\nChristmas. And you don't know the\nsacrifices I make for this newspaper.\nIn order to write this article in\nadvance of thc publication of thc\nRadio Times, I was forced to buy\nthe Sunday People. The Sunday\nPeople! I'm too good to you people.\nThis year, I sense a greater proportion of films, particularly on\nBBC1, but it doesn't affect the overall quality of the schedules, which\nare pretty good. Starting at the top,\nthc Christmas Day viewing looks\npretty solid, though it should be\nsaid that at the\ntime of writing,\nITV had not fully\ndisclosed their\nfilm listings. Babe\n(BBC1, Christmas\nEve, 6:05pm) is\ndefinitely worth\nwatching, but,\ngood as it is, it pales into insignificance against possibly the greatest\nof them all, Casablanca (BBC2,\nChristmas Day,\n3:10pm), just\nafter Her\nMajesty' s Address; Bogart also crops\nup later in The\nMaltese Falcon (BBC2,\nChristmas Day,\n12:25am). Elsewhere\nPeter Sellers stars\nStretch (C4, Christmas Day, 3:15pm) thc story of planning a perfect rob\nbe ry. Aside\nfrom films,\nthe soaps are m ever-present-Eastenders( BBC1, Christmas Day, 5:35pm and 8\nCoronation Street (ITV,\nDay, 7:00pm) but of more interest\nis the first part of a trilogy of Men\nBehaving Badly (BBC1, Christmas\nDay, 9:50pm; Boxing Day, 9:35pm; Bank Holiday Monday,9:00 pm), which will end the marvellously successful series. A Christmas Day's viewing would be woefully in com the brilliant\ni Two Way\n30pm) and\nChristmas\nple te without Morecambe and Wise,\nand thankfully we ate safe this year\n(BBC1, Christmas Day, 11:10pm). Luckily, this\nwill not be\nthe only outing for Eric\nand Ernie.\nBring Me\nSun shl ne The Life and\nDeath of Eric\nMorecambe\n( BBC1, Wednesday23 rd,9:30 pm), That Riviera Touch\n(BBC1, Sunday 20th,11:00am) and\nThe Magnificent Two (BBC1, Thursday 24th,12:45am) are all well\nworth watching. Other titans of the\ncomedy world are featured this\nChristmas in thc flawless Heroes of\nComedy series, namely Tommy\nCooper (C4, December30 th,7:00 pm) and Benny Hill (C4, New Year's Eve, 8:45pm). I expected that after last year,\nthe schedulers would have realised\ntheir grave error, but bizarrely The\nItalian Job is nowhere to be seen\nagain. All is not lost, because there\nis a short feature on the making of\nthc film, Mini Job (C4, Christmas\nSunday, 6:00pm); Michael Caine\nfans can find further solace in thc\nshowing of Funeral in Berlin (BBC2,\nSaturday 19th,12:05am). Thankfully,\nthat other stalwart, The Sound of\nMusic (BBC1, Sunday 20th,2:00 pm) is safely installed, as arc Gunfight at\nthe OK Corral (BBC2, Monday 21st,4:00 pm) and The\nWizard\ni of Oz\nBBC1,| Christmas Sunday,\n2:45pm). Bond aficionados are\nunusually well catered for, with\nthree films, the reasonable A View\n| to a Kill (ITV,\nBoxing Day,\n7 : 4 5 pm), George faze n by' s On\nHer Majesty's Secret Service\n(ITV, Bank Holiday Monday, and You only Live Twice\nYear's Day, 8:00pm). Rapidly establishing itself as a Christmas institution is the\nNaked Gun series, to wit the\nscreening of\nNaked Gun Vh-. '^g The Smell of ^*\nFear (BBC1, Boxing Day, 11:05pm). You've seen it a dozen times, but it\nremains as fresh as the proverbial\ndaisy.\nYou would think less of me if I did not pick out the Carry On films\nshowing this Christmas. This year,\nthere are slightly fewer than usual,\nname Carry On Again, Doctor (BBC1,\nChristmas Eve, 12:40am), At Your\nBoxlr Day,\n2:30pm( ITV, New Convenience( BBC\n12:25am),|f fi>. the excellent Cleo\n(ITV, Bank\nHoliday Monday,11:15 pm), Girls( BBC1, Wednesday30 th,1:35am) and the dreadful Columbus (BBC1,\nNew Year's Eve, 12:35am).I shall\nonly be watching thc latter since I have not yet seen it- not exactly the\nstrongest recommendation, I grant\nyou. Of undoubtedly more quality is\nPerfectly Frank (BBC2, from Bank\nHoliday Monday). To detail the features of\nthis tribute would\nfill pages,\nbut essentially\nit consists\nof a number of Of Blue Eyes'\nfilms interspersed with five minute segments throughout thc day, in much\nthe same mould as the James Stewart tribute last year, which, in a link\nworthy of Pebble Mill at One, te minds me that It's a Wonderful\nLife (BBC2, Christmas Eve, 6:15pm) should not be missed.\nIt may seem that I am concentrating mainly on films this year, but\nthat is because there seems at first\nglance to be less in the way of\nChristmas one-offs and suchlike. Of\ncourse, we have the usual range of\nspecials, such as They Think it's All\nOver (BBC1,\nChristmas Day,10:35 pm), a repeat of\nFather Ted\n(C4, Christmas Eve,\n9 : 3 0 pm), Have I Got\nNews For You (BBC2, Saturday 19th,10:00 pm), Christmas Countdown\nFinal (C4, Christmas Day, 4:45pm), Jo\nBrand's Christmas Log (C4, Bank\n11oli day Monday, 1 0:45pm) and The\nBill (IlV, Friday 18th,8:00 pm), featuring Leslie\nGrantham and Denise\nVan Outen, an odd couple if ever\nthere were. Speaking of odd, there\nis something by the name of Dale 'if\nonly I could be Larry Grayson' Winton's Wonderland (BBC1, Wednesday 23rd,10.40 pm). Considering the\nlate time of ttan s mission, I shudder\nto think what the content will be.\nA quick flick through my notes\nshows that I have forgotten a few\nbig films,\nsuch as\nSpeed( BBC1, Tuesday 22nd,9:30 pm), Indecent Proposal( BBCl, Friday 18th,9:30 pm), Mrs Brown (BBCl, Christmas Sunday, 8:55pm) and Nixon\nmmm mm^ j(B it ci,\" Christ mas Sund ay,10:00 pm). The latter\nhas been\nwickedly scheduled on the same night as The\nClinton Complex: How To Live With\nA Dysfunctional President (BBC2,\nChristmas Sunday, 8:00pm), the content of which seems pretty self-explanatory. So there you go, that\nshould keep you busy over the festive season in the gaps between\npub opening hours. Eat, drink and,\nwell, you know the rest. Merry\nChristmas and a Happy New Year,\nmy dears.\n\n"

    "content": "16 December 1998\nGrand Tourismo\n(Racer)\nIf old golden specs is the reason to own\na N64 then it is this game that was\nresponsible for masses of PlayStations\nand dual shock controllers walking off the\nshelves and into homes everywhere. 166\ndifferent cars to drive, forward, rear and\nfour-wheel handling, as realistic as you\ncan get not using a steering wheel. I his\nGoldeneye\n(Shooter)\nThe film was good. It introduced a new\nBond, a new era. The game, which is only\navailable for the N64 (much to the annoyance of the PC and Playstation faithful),\nis better. In fact it is quite superb. Upon\nits release it was hailed as the pinnacle\nof the first-person adventure shooter\ngenre, if not the pinnacle of the entire\ngames market, and to this day there\nhave been few games to challenge for\nits title...\nGenerally speaking, Goldencye\nbowls you over not by any single aspect\nof its amazing game-play, but rather the\nprofessionalism and quality that endorses\nits every detail.\nEach mission asks you to perform\ncertain tasks that will not only require the\npummelling of enemy guards but also\nthe use of stealth and initiative. The\nhuge variety of weapons comes complete with an aiming sight, and in some\ncases this is telescopic, allowing you to\npick off targets from a distance and with\nwas and still is the driver's driving game.\nWith all this handling you would expect\ncom prim is e in the graphics or perhaps\nthe sound. Oh no, not in this simulation,\nthe graphics are crisper than the chips at\nthe bottom of the packet, the sounds of\nthe engines arc almost sexual, and for\nonce the soundtrack matches the game\nwith Garbage and Ash contributions urging you onto faster lap times. 11 '98\nmight feature faster cars but racing Nissan Bluebirds against Dodge Vipers is\nmuch more satisfying.\n(3-D Platformer)\nDark dank urban settings. Extreme ultraviolent executions. Set in honour ridden\n17th Century Japan you are set on a path\nof assassination, evasion, and postal\ndeliveries where the least of your worries\narc dogs called woof ie. Excellent\nscenery, smoothly animated fight scenes\n- the all out lunge will sec you imp a i lcd like a cocktail sausage on some pike-man's pole - and spooky sound can lead\nto some very late nights. Even better\nnews is the Tcnchu 2 project. Bloodier\nand bigger. Let's hope they've sorted\nthe controls out.\none shot to the head. Drive tanks, rescue the Bond girl, infiltrate enemy bases,\nvisit the jungle - the whole film plot is\nhere.\nNeedless to say, the multi-player\nmode is excellent and it's great fun\ntrouncing your mates into a bloody pulp,\nusing any of the characters and\nweapons, il could well make you go out\nand buy the console for this game alone.\nAfter all, that's what happened to\nmyself...\nFl World Grand Prix\n(Racer)\nlol low lng the drivers and teams of the\n1997 season, you can drive a single race,\nagainst a pal, against the clock or for an\nentire season. What makes this simulation rule above all others are the unbelievable graphics and the wonderfully\nrealistic car handling. Grab a steering\nwheel and there's no stopping you...\nTomb Raider 3\n(3-D Platformer)\nWell what more needs to be added on\nthis subject. It is still the best general 3-D platformer, with just the right balance\nbetween the athletic timed run and\njumps, the puzzle element, and the pure\nreaction shooting parts. Tomb raider 3 is\nnot a revolutionary jump and as the old\nmaxim goes 'if it works - don't fix if. I hey\nhave tinkered slightly with the graphics\nengine, put in some nice graphical\neffects and allowed Lara a few more\nslinky moves but it is still the queen of the\nstreet, the Jungle, and pretty much every\nhistorical site where big dangerous creatures hang out.\nPoint Blank\n(Big Gun Game)\nThe most legal fun you can have with a gun (especially an over sized plastic pis-tol). A console copy of an excellent arcade\ngame. With the standard Time Crisis gun\nall that is missing is the recoil. There are\ntwo ways around this. Either go out and\npurchase the new recoil gun (a gun with\na rumble pack inside) or get are let iv c or\nflat mate to hit your hands hard.\nBanjo Kazooie\n(3-D Platformer)\nHoney bear and bird respectively. Banjo\nand kazoo ic star in this colourful and\ncute 3D platform-adventure game.\nBoasting a huge world to explore, numerous baddies to stomp on and some puzzle solving loo. this is one fantasy\nadventure that'll last.\nTurok 2\n(Shooter)\n\\ 3D shooter with a difference, lu rok2 sees you setting off to save the Earth\nFuturecop LAPD\n(3-D Platformer)\nNot another platform game you all\nscream at me. Yep. len chu had stealth,\nlom b raider has its puzzles. lulu rc Cop has its heavy weapons and its two-player\noptions. Better living though heavier firepower would be its motto as the Police\nrobot pacifies street riots using mini\nguns, rockets and mortar rounds. Lots of\nblood, lots ol special graphics and lots of\nfun. Gary 5.\nfrom ghastly aliens and monstrous\ndinosaurs. Graphics are lush, weapons\narc plentiful and enemies have advanced\nAl and will hide or run if attacked. Also\nthe levels are bigger than Wolverhampton and Dudley put together. Unfortunately lo play the game in (he best\npossible graphics mode you will need the\nnintendo memory pack. But like buying\na rumble pack for Goldeneye you just will\nnot regret it.\n1080\u00b0 Snowboarding\n(Sports)\nAt last there is a decent snowboarding\nsim to shout about. Compete against the\nconsole or another player in a race to\nreach the bottom of the slope;, and while;\nyou're at it take your opponents out (not\nall that sporting but very ge>od fun), do\nsome fancy tricks (useful for impressing\nyour parents and young relatives during\nthe>se long Xmas evenings) or just marvel at the graphics!\nViv\n\n"

    "content": "18\nGUBlieS 16 December 1998\nCombat Flight Simulator (PC)\nMicrosoft\nIn a continuation of their flight simulator\nseries Microsoft has released Combat\nFlight Simulator. At first glance it seems\nnothing has changed from the original,\nhowever there is one significant differ-en ce. Yup, you can now kick ass when\nyou fly! Unlike its predecessor, where\nyou have to study the manual just to\nwork out how to get the plane off the\nground, I managed to take off successfully with only a little help. Microsoft\nhave realised that the average games\nplayer doesn't want to spend hours working out how to start the game!\nSo what does the game offer? Surprisingly, for a flight simulation it offers\na significant amount. The game has five\nmodes. Free flight is where you can practice flying and shooting without anyone\nelse getting in the way. Quick combat\nstarts the game in the air where you\ntake on a series of aircraft - you can set\nthe skill of the other pilots and the type\nof aircraft. Single mission is where you\nchoose a 'real' mission from a list and\ncomplete it. Campaigns are where you\nhave to fly a series of missions chosen\nfrom either the Battle of Britain or Battle\nover Europe. Oh, and there is the usual\nnetwork features allowing multiple players to fight it out. The game comes with\nsoftware to allow you to play in the MSN\ngaming zone against other WWII air aces.\nIn terms of graphics it has improved\nsignificantly from Flight Simulator as 16-bit colour graphics are supported. The\ndegree of realism is impressive, considering that virtually all aspects have been\nconsidered, such as haze, fog, light glare\nand even tracer from both friendly and\nenemy machine guns. It even has\nfamous landmarks, which will guide you\nwhen you're lost, as there is no\nmap feature in the plane. But is the\nJamc? any good? I he answer is yes\nand no. Considering all these cool\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 features it takes a lot of skill and\nill power to master the art of\nshi lOt ing another plane down. You\ncan put this down to the fact that\n|\nfj the weapons at your disposal arc\nmachine guns, cannons and a rocket launcher or two if you're\nlucky. So if you're into high tech-\\ |\nHH HH HH HH^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ If\nno logy weapons such as laser targeting,\nor fire and forget missiles then this game\nisn't for you! Along with the graphics, the\nsound is lush too. Piug your soundcard\ninto your stereo, turn up the volume and\nit sounds like you're in a plane. There is\neven a pilot radio so you can either have\nan American, English or, if you download\na patch, a German voice informing you\nhow badly you are doing. So what else\nIs left to baffle the senses? Yup, Microsoft\nhas made the game compatible with the\nforce feedback Sidewinder (the \u00a3 1 0 0\nversion) which will let you feel the G forces whilst pulling tight turns!\n(and firing the weapons produces\nsatisfying recoil - Games Ed.)\nI personally am not a fan of\nflight sims, but I was pleasantly\nsurprised how the game has\nsolved the old problem of sims. If\nyou make the game too detailed\nonly a few dedicated souls would\never play it, make it too simple\nand the game won't last longer\nthan a week. By allowing the user\nto control the amount of realism (G forces, wind shear, glare and ice\nforming on the wings are all user\ncontrolled) you can play as a complete beginner or as a veteran flight\nsim pilot, this game should be to\neveryone's taste but the main problem is the cost. The quoted price is \u00a344.99\nwhich is steep for a PC game, but it is in\nsome ways justified considering the\ndetail of the planes and simulation (there\nis also a \u00a3 1 0 rebate if you already own\nthe latest flight Sim from Microsoft).\nIf you've got a3 Dfx card in your PC\nand want a new game which uses it\napart from Quake then MS Combat simulator would certainly be a good buy.\nOtherwise I would suggest beefing up\nyour PC and then buying the game.\nBeel\nPopulous - The Beginning (PC)\nBullfrog\nfor those of you who came in late, Populous has something of a heritage in\ncomputer gaming circles. It was a game\nin which you were a god, worshipped\nfrom afar by a tribe. You had to use your\npowers to overwhelm a neighbouring\ntribe, controlled by a rival god, and conquer a( square) area. It was innovative\nin its time, but very remote and ultimately really rather same y. It spawned\ntwo sequels (Populous2 and a game\ncalled Powermonger), and a few inferior\nimitators.\n'Populous-The Beginning' is the latest revision of the original Populous concept - and it's a damned fine one, taking\nelements of games as diverse as\nCommand & Conquer and Civilization. Instead of a remote\ngod, you control a shaman. This\nshaman is the focal point of the\ntribe, worshipped by the tribes-men. When not worshipping,\nthese tribesmen can be ordered\nto build huts of various types,\ntrain to become warriors and\npriests and generally get on with\nincreasing your tribe by non-vio-lent means.\nThe gam c play( which in Populous\ntended to be rather linear - get manna,\ncast spell, get manna, cast s pcl! and so\non) has been expanded. Besides sending your armed warriors off to knock\nseven shades of shit out of your ene-mies, you can despatch priests to convert\nthem, or increase your tribe by casting\nspells at the wild men who creep around\nyour village. The spherical game area\nalso vastly increases your options.\nInstead of building a land bridge from\none corner of the world to the other (as\nin the original Populous), you can set off\nto attack your enemies by balloon or\nship. Of course the same options are\nopen to your enemies, which means\nthat you have to be focused on developments both in your raiding parties and\nin your village. There is also an increasing amount of reliance on lateral thinking - why lead a raiding party at your\nopponent's village when you could sneak\nround the back and achieve your objective that way?\nThere are some very neat touches,\nboth in terms of gameplay and graphics.\nIn the original game you could cast spells\nanywhere in the game area. In 'Popu-lou s The Beginning' each spell can only\nbe cast within a certain range of the\nshaman, which means that, unless you\nwant to rely on brute force to\ncrush your opponent, you have\nto take your shaman along with\nyou. This in turn puts her\n(a no the t nice touch - the\nshaman is female) in danger of\nbeing killed herself. Don't fret\ntoo much, as she will (event u ally) be reincarnated; but you\nwill have to play a certain\namount of the game without\nher, which can get a bit hairy.\nThe graphics arc fluid and\nwell-defined, even without a3D accelerator card, and the control system simple to use. There's also a rather\nimpressive opening sequence, which\nsets up the game nicely. I haven't yet\nseen the ending sequence - contact me\nin about six months time.\nI desperately wanted to dislike this\ngame (partly because our beloved\nGames Ed likes it, and partly because I always thought the original Populous\noverrated), but I can't. There may be\nsome out there who think that Populous\nis getting a bit long in the tooth now -disagree. I think it's just come of age.\nDanny\n\n"

Flash words are definitely needed, since Hollywood is picking\nfrom the bottom of the barrel for superheroes to adapt for the big screen.\nThe first part of the Mask of Zorro\nsets up this whole elaborate plot where\nHopkins is discovered to be the true\nZorro. His life is then destroyed when his\nwife is killed by the current Spanish governor of the region, played by Stuart Wilson, who then takes Hopkins' baby\ndaughter to bring up as his own, letting\nour hero rot it jail for 20 years. This part\nof the film is fascinating and the film's expectations start to rise. Hopkins is\ntotally believable as the ageing Zorro; his\nnobility and debonair attitude combined\nwith calculated revenge, brings tremendous weight and depth to the character.\nTwenty years later the governor\nreturns to Mexico, with Hopkins' da ugh ter, intent on buying Mexico's independence. When Banderas is introduced as\nthe new Zorro, trained by Hopkins (who\nhas, of course, escaped), the film starts\nDead Man's Curve\nChristmas stands for many things. Being\nforce fed by your mother; being forced\nto endure your grandparents,- going to\nany lengths to avoid the Queen's speech; turkey risotto. But most of all,\nChristmas means presents.\nSo, thanks to those delightful people\nat Beatwax Promotions, we've got stacks\nof prizes to give away. Rrst-up is Dead\nMan's Curve. This indie-thriller has won\ngreat acclaim in the US, and stars\nScream's Matthew Lillard as a College\nfreshman who takes one-up man ship a little too far...\nTo bag movie t elated goodies,\nincluding t shirts, bottle openers and a signed posters, then simply tell me:\nWhich member of the Scream cast\nstarred in The Wedding Singer?\nAnswers should be emailed to\nfilm.felix@ic.ac.uk, and must be received\nby Thursday evening. All prize winners will be notified by email on Friday.\nto mix the darker story line with what\nmust be said as slapstick comedy. This\nmay be due to thc many television\nremakes of Zorro, which has given thc\ncharacter a humourous side, but it does-n't work when the film's foundation has\nbeen built on a foreboding story line.\nDirector Martin Campbell (Tomor-row Never Dies) does well to restrain the\naction - however this restraint vanishes\nas the film just deteriorates into a typical\nA Life Less Ordinary\nThis time around, we've got copies of the\nvideo, novel and screenplay to give away\nto one lucky punter, to tie in (belatedly)\nwith the video release of Danny Boyle's underrated follow-up to Trainspotting.\nThis time, all I want to know is :\nIn which US TV series did Ewan\nMcGregor make a notable guest\nappearance?\nOnce again, answers should be emailed\nto film.felix@ic.ac.uk. If you get stuck, I suggest looking at thc Internet Movie\nDatabase, www.uk.imdb.com. It's great.\nHollywood ending with a huge explosive\nfinale. The sword scenes are coordinated\nextremely well and the knife edge excitement holds well even though both Hopkins and Banderas were fencing novices.\nThe Mask of Zorro was a bit of a disappointment as it started well, frequently\nreminding me of those old Clint tast-wood westerns, but then it just plunges\ninto mediocrity.

It blew me away.\nRadiohead are one of those bands\nwho, whilst you may like their music,\nyou always fear may be completely up\ntheir own arse s in real life. A bunch of\npretentious tw at s, if you will. Meeting\nPeople, however, gives them a chance\nto show their true colours, as it follows\nthe band through twelve months\naround the release of OK Computer.\nGee captures dozens of live gigs and\nseemingly hundreds of interviews - but\nnever interviews them himself. This\nallows their t tue reaction to fame to\nbecome ap patent, as they interact with\nthe (frequently idiotic) local journalists.\nThe masterstroke, however, is the\nway Gee deals with Thorn Yorke. Whilst\nthe rest of thc band spend the fit st half\nof thc film coming across as a perfectly\nnormal bunch of blok es, Yorkc hangs\naround in the background, seemingly\ntrying to avoid the came t as. Then, sud-den ly, the director turns the-focus on\nhim. Thc film immediately becomes a portrait of someone who can only be\ndescribed as a pained genius. He can't believe the fame - can't believe they\ndeserve it - and constantly feats the\nbacklash that will hit when everyone\ncomes to their senses. Then, when he\nstarts to write new music...Wow.\nI'm not a huge Radiohead fan - but\nthe moment I left the cinema I went\nstraight home and put OK Computer on\nrepeat. It's an amazing film.

    "content": "40\nReviews\nFilm\nRush Hour * * \u2022 *\nStarring : Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Tom Wilkinson\nDirector: Brett Ratner\n16 December 1998\nT he ideal action hero needs to\nembody three, very disparate, ele-ment s: he needs to be hard as\nnails (obviously); he needs to be charismatic enough to make you forget how\npaper thin the plot is; and he needs to\nbe really funny. Many stars have tried to\ncapture all three, but few have succeeded - Arnie isn't funny, Mel Gibson\nisn't hard enough, Harrison ford's too\nnice, Van Damme can't act. The list\ngoes on.\nNew fine Pictures have, however,\ncome up with a new solution to this age\nold problem. Because by fusing together\nthe best bits of Chan (a legend in Hong\nkong action movies) and Tucker (the DJ\nwith the annoying voice in The Fifth Element), you can create the perfect action\nhero. In other words, don't let Jackie\nChan actually say anything (which, considering he still doesn't seem too sure of\nhis English, is not necessarily a bad thing),\nthus allowing Chris Tucker free reign to\nwise-crack at will - and in return, allow\nChan the freedom to kick the bad guys senseless in his customarily brilliant f ash ion. Plus, of course, there are no hyper-inflationary wage packets involved, and\nIts not size that matters - Its what you do with It that counts.\nno hideously expensive set-piece stunts.\nOn paper, it's a neat faultless solution.\nIn practice, however, there are a few\ndrawbacks to this plan, as Rush Hour\nturns out to be a Chris luck cr movie. Consequently, Chan seems muted when it\ncomes to the fight scenes, and whilst\nsome of the moves he pulls are still\namazing, there's not the edge-of-your-seat reality, coupled with a great sense\nof humour, that normally highlights his\nwork. It's too Hollywood; too staged.\nOn the other hand, it's still a very\nrefreshing break from the current crop of\nhigh-octane world-in-jeopardy action ers. At points, the pair do seem to bounce off\neach other with a teal sense of friend-ship, and both ate (in completely differing ways) hugely likable. And whilst\nTucker's banter may have more than a passing resemblance to mid-eighties\nEddie Murphy, he still shows thc comic\nflare that first brought him fame on the\nstand-up c it cu it. Moreover, even if Chan\ndoes seem a little restrained at times, he\nstill displays the ballet ic sense of flowing\nmovement and timing that has made\nhim a star. Witness the lessons he gives\nTucker on how to disarm someone. Or\nthe way he manages to bypass the entire\nFBI in order to get into the Chinese Consulate. Simply stunning.\nMost importantly, however. Rush\nHour has that one key ingredient that\nHollywood seems to have forgotten\nrecently - its great fun. Recent blockbusters have been visually impressive,\nbut have lacked that element of sheer\nentertainment that made the original\nLethal Weapon and the Indiana Jones\nfranchise into hits. What more can you\nask for? \u2022\nDave\nThe Acid House * * \u2022\nStarring : Ewen Bremner, Martin Clunes, Alex Howden, Stephen McCole, Kevin McKidd\nDirector: Paul McGuigan\nThis picture tells you absolutely nothing about the film. Clever, huh?\nThink of fra in spotting. Think of its\nauthor, Irvine Welsh. Think of rundown Edinburgh estates. Think of\nextraordinary use of fu** and cu\". Think\nof very strong Scottish accents. Think of\na cool Britpop sound t tack. If you choose\nnot to think, I 'll go ahead and tell you.\n\"The Acid House\" is based on the bestselling collection of short s to tics of the\nsame name written by Irvine Welsh.\nThree stories were picked from the collection and adapted for the screen by\nWelsh himself, resulting in three forty-minutes films showing one after the\nother.\nThe first, The Oranton Star Cause, is\nabout the happenings of a terrible day\nfor Stephen McCole. The day of doom\nstarts off with his football team, Granton\nStat, dumping him for a quicker lad. The\nbad news quickly builds up, leaving\nMcCole absolutely dumfounded, and following the traditional course of action on\nsuch occasions - drowning his sorrows in\na pub. Then along comes a bearded fellow by the name of God who proceeds\nto speak his mind... At once thought-pro-vo king and funny, this story is excellent.\nThe second is entitled A Soft Touch.\nIt is about kevin Mckidd (tommy in\nTrainspotting) who is (can you guess?) a soft touch - easily taken advantage of,\nmuzzled, and outright bullied. I'd much\nrather you discovered for yourself who\nhis tormentors are, rather than spoil your\nchance to properly enjoy the movie. I kept wondering as thc film developed\nhow this affecting tale would climax -but, perhaps somewhat symbolically, the\ndenouement was beyond anything I'd suspected.\nThe third film is entitled The Acid\nHouse, after which the collection is\nnamed. It is a very vivid, very colourful\njourney into the various sensations and\nfeelings associated with taking acid. But\nthis time, there is a nice twist. Ewen\nBremner (Trainspotting's Spud) takes as up et acid pill which knocks him unconscious and transports him into the body\nof a newborn baby in an ambulance\nnearby. Likewise, the baby's mind goes\ninto the big boy's body. Cue hilarious\nconsequences. God alone knows what\nthe message of this piece is supposed to\nbe.\nAnyway, this three-in-one deal is\nenjoyable, thought-provoking, and funny.\nThc soundtrack is not, I think, as groundbreaking as the Trainspotting one.\nthough there are some specially-written\ntracks. Although The Acid House's opening on New Year's Day will undoubtedly\nbe surrounded by massive hype, it's probably no less than it de set ve s.O Ahmed\n\n"

As a result of a serious incident\non 1 December, this decision is now\nfacing stern criticism. A member of\nthe technical staff In the Biochemistry\nDepartment suffered serious cuts to\nher hand, which resulted in one ligament being completely severed and\nanother being 90% detached.

She goes\non to add that \"there is emergency\ncover on Tuesday afternoons and there\narc very clear instructions both at the\nHealth Centre and on our answerphone as to how to access it\".\nNevertheless, both Mr Hatch and\nMr Garden feel that the closure of the\nHealth Centre during official College\nhours is inherently dangerous, with\nMr Hatch describing it as \"something\nIf ec i is totally wrong\".

    "content": "28\nFeature 16 December 1998\nNietzsche's Ghost on the Cross\ny^^^B fr it c ii uh> fi wil| i eim Nietzsche\n1844- 1900\nNietzsche's works have been said to have had an influence on contemporary history, to have been the inspiration of Nazism. This was somehow predicted by\nNietzsche himself, who wrote;\n\"I know my fate. One day my name will be\nassociated with the memory of something\ntremendous... I am no man, I am dynamite\"\nfro/17 Ecce Homo\nWhat lies behind the mysterious aphorisms of this\nman, who ended his days in complete madness?\nAmong the most important features of his thoughts\nis the need for the common human being to be over-come, so that a new breed of 'demi-god' men can take\ntheir place. All the old virtues must be overcome;\ncompassion, piety, love for the weak ones. The new\nmen must be fully aware of themselves and their\npotential, they must pursue continuous self improvement and achieve power.\n\"What is good? Everything that rises the sense\nof power, the will of fulfilment of the human\nbeing. What is bad? Everything that comes out\nof weakness. What is happiness? To feel that\nthe power is growing, that one resistance lias\nbeen overcome\"\nfrom Antichrist pre faction According to these statements, during his life Nietzsche fought the most powerful aspect of European cul-ture, whose roots have influenced us for millennia -Christianity.\nNietzsche's philosophy is essentially egoistic - but\nthis word must be considered in its original Greek\nmeaning; \"Myself and not anything else, as the fulcrum\nof everything.\" Nietzsche therefore refuses every kind\nof 'superimposed' form of morality:\n\"There are no moral phenomena, but only\nmoral interpretation of phenomena\"\nfrom Beyond Good and Evil\nHe underlines that the human being must love this\nworld and not live thinking of heaven:\n\"The Christian resolve to find the world ugly\nand bad has made the world ugly and bad.\"\nChristianity, according to him, is an illness which drives us to some form of paranoia, it makes us spend\nhours praying to an ill-defined God, it teaches us that\nif we cannot achieve something, or even when we can,\nit is just because of the will of God. Christianity says\nthat God must be at the centre of our minds, of our\nhopes, of our lives and that God loves most the weak\nby Matteo Floris\nand poor, and dislikes the strong. Nietzsche wishes for\na recovery from this 'illness':\n\"What is the seal of attained freedom? No\nlonger being ashamed in front of oneself\" and\n\"I call Christianity the one great curse, the\ngreat intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct\nfor revenge for which no expedient is sufficiently poisonous, subterranean, petty - I call\nthe one mortal blemish of mankind.\"\nThese ideas somehow recall Feuerbach's thoughts:\nGod is the puppet made of all the frustrations and\nmanias of men. Man has put in this illusion all the\nvirtues that he cannot achieve; being good, being\nomnipotent, being immortal. The only cure is to throw\naway this puppet: Men can improve themselves only\nif they care about themselves, not about God. There\nis a link here with Marxism; \"Religion is the opium of\nthe people\".\nBoth Marx and Feuerbach's ideas came from the\nsame 19th century Hegelian philosophy. Nietzsche is\nsomehow different: He doesn't call for a socialist society as Marx and Feuerbach did; in fact his philosophy\nis totally adverse to concepts such as mass, community\nand sociality. His hero, the wandering Zarathustra of his\nmasterpiece \"Thus spoke Zarathustra\", is a wise hermit\nwho has learned from nature and wants to teach men\nhow the common human being can be improved. His\ncomplete hate of doctrine (and the brainwashing that\nsometimes follows it) is revealed in the part of \"Thus\nspoke Zarathustra\" where some disciples want to follow the prophet in order to learn more. Zarathustra,\nhowever, says\n\"if you want to improve, now that I taught you\nsomething, you must learn how to hate me.\nAfter you will have achieved this, we can get\nwell again. This is because I want you to be the\nteachers of yourself, there must be no guide for\nyou, not even myself\"\n- a clear attack to the figure of Jesus.\nNietzsche docs not regard Jesus as a charlatan who\nwanted to cheat and trap men in Christianity, but sees\nin him a guide who tried to teach something to humanity (as Zarathustra did); a guide who never pretended\nthat the focal point in being a Christian was the need\nto continuously worship Christ. In his view, men should\nnot worship Jesus, they should improve and become\nsuper-humans as he was. It is humanity who has mis-understood, and made an idol of a demi-god who had\njust found his personal way to' superiority1. Why did this\nhappen? Probably because\n\"madness is rare in individuals - but in groups,\nparties, nations and ages it is the rule\"\nfrom Beyond Good and Evil\nIn his opinion, the Church (which is an 'organised worshipping society') is hence made of charlatans who are\nready to manipulate consciences in order to become\nricher and more powerful:\n\"Vicious is every thought against nature. The\nmost vicious is the priest: everything he teaches\nis against nature\"\nfrom Law against Christianity\nIf I were to analyse these ideas, first of all I would\nsay that Nietzsche could hardly have been the inspiration for Nazism. Although ideas of power taken by a new breed of men are present in it, Nietzsche's philosophy calls for complete individualism and refuses any\nkind of external influence on the single human being.\nThis obviously does not match with the complete faith\nand obedience that was typical of the Nazis towards\nAdolf Hitler.\nIn my view, Nietzsche underlines the need for\nmen to improve, to look inside themselves and to\nsolve their problems using their own resources, without the need for external help - hence the hatred for\nChristianity (in which the focus of the mind is God), the\nhate for socialism (in which the focus of the mind is on\nthe mass, not on the individual), the need to become\ndifferent, stronger, completely self-confident, brave in\nfront of everything:\n\"When you look inside the abyss, the abyss\nlooks into you.\"\nThere is a need to recover from this 'Christian III \"If the Christian dogmas of a revengeful God,\nuniversal sinfulness, election by divine grace\nand the danger of eternal damnation were\ntrue, it would be a sign of weak-mindedness\nand lack of character not to become a priest,\napostle or hermit and, in fear and trembling,\nto work solely on one's salvation; it would be\nsenseless to lose sight of one's eternal advantage for the sake of temporal comfort. If we\nmay assume that these things are at any rate\nbelieved true, then the everyday Christian cuts\na miserable figure; he is a man who really cannot count to three, and who precisely on\naccount of his spiritual imbecility does not\ndeserve to be punished so harshly as Christianity promises to punish him.\"\nNo matter how much we agree or disagree with\nNietzsche, nobody can deny that his thoughts are intellectually challenging with respect to everything we\nbelieve is right and fair.\nIs it possible for a Christian to share some of Nietzsche's views on the need for self-improvement without 'external help'? I think so, as long as Christianity\nis considered a struggle against man's selfish and\nweak nature and not a comfortable refuge from human\nmiseries. It is a battle that the fellows must fight\nwithin themselves. Confession with a priest, compassion towards a weak personality, prayers to God in\norder to obtain help must be banned in completing this\ntask. In my view, Christians should raise themselves\nalone and let nobody else, neither a priest nor Jesus,\ndo that.\n\n"

So unless Ms. Cookson\nfinishes her novel from beyond the\ngrave, or Lilliput Lane extend their range\ninto the nineties, to include \"58 - Urine\ndrenched multi-storey carpark\" and \"59 -Secure Training Unit for Young Offenders\", that's the way it's going to stay.\nI suppose that I could adopt the\nstrategy that my grandmother employs\nwhen buying Christmas presents for my\nbrother and myself. It's simplicity itself\nand she has used it to good effect every\nyear since 1982. It consists of striding purposefully into the nearest branch of\nMarks and Sparks, accosting the first\nmale shop assistant one sees and in\nringing tones, reminiscent\nof Julia Pargiter out of The\nArchers, calling out \"Ah, yes young man.\nBe good enough to show me the most\nhideous V neck polyester double-knit\nsweater that you have in stock. Something that Val Doonican wouldn't be seen\ndead in. Pus-yellow if possible and with\na design that frightens cats. No, no\nyoung man, that won't do at all - that one\nwould go with jeans. No, that's no good\neither. Look it's quite simple for heaven's sake - they're for my grandsons and I want to destroy any remaining vestiges\nof self-esteem they may have. That one?\nGood God that's repulsive - I 'll take two\".\nI shouldn't really complain as times are\nhard for the older folk in our society - my\nimmediate family included - but I can't help feeling that she's partly responsible\nfor her current financial condition. Six\nhorse accumulators rarely come up even\nat Chepstow and I just think that the\ninsurance money she got after her bungalow burnt down could have been\nmore wisely invested. Still, there's no\ntelling some people.\nWhen the subject of fiscal outlay in\nthis particular context comes up, it's practically de rig u er amongst us columnists\nto express profound cynicism towards\nthe institution of Christmas, to decry the\ncommercial is ation of the whole affair\nand bemoan the gluttony which the festive season typically entails. Making a principled stand against the gaudy and\nhedonistic binge that Christmas has\nundoubtedly become makes us feel\nmorally cleansed and intellectually superior. It allows us to feel that our Christmas\nis somehow better, more authentic and\nless adulterated than that experienced by\nthe plebs. Ironically, it seems that far\nfrom bringing people together, the festive season divides the nation into two\nopposing camps. On the one hand there\nare the people who celebrate \"Xmas\" by\nspending more than the GDP of some\nAfrican nations on presents, going carol-singing and pigging out on turkey with\nall the trimmings, and on the other is a quite different crowd who enjoy a frugal\n\"yuletide\" by going \"a wassailing\" and sitting down to roast goose and a selection\nof vegetables that are normally reserved\nfor use in animal fodder, followed by candied fruits and a glass of a 'rather decent\nport actually'. I'm sure that for every \"Ten\nWays to Snog the Co-Worker You Fancy\nat the Office Party this Xmas\"-type article\nin magazines and tabloid newspapers\nthis year there'll be a Sunday broadsheet\nfeature on how to \"Create Your Own Victorian Christmas\" written by an effete\nMatt Salter history graduate from the\nHome Counties with a double-barrelled name.\nIt's true that Victorian scenes of\nhappy revellers clad in mufflers and\nheavy overcoats, going a wassailing in\nthe snow with shiny green holi y wreaths\npresent a most attractive picture of a bygone Arcadia. However, when you\nconsider that at the time central heating\nwas yet to be invented and thus the persons in the scene were forced to wrap\nthemselves up in that charming way to\navoid hypothermia, and bear in mind\nthat with infant mortality rates being\nwhat they were in Victorian Britain the\nmerry-makers concerned were lucky to\nhave made it past their fifth birthday, the\npicture loses some of its rosy glow. On\nthe whole I find the \"if it's old, it must be\nbetter\" school of thought deeply irritating\nand I'm willing to bet that given the\nchoice between the over-indulgent, back-pocket-s lapp lng ASDA Christmas of the\nlate twentieth century and the archetypal Dickensian yuletide that launched\na thousand Hallmark greetings cards,\nBob Cratchet would at least have to give\nthe matter careful consideration (\"Well\n'pon my word Tiny Tim, it do appear that\nthese modern folks have but little regard\nfor the birthday of our Lord. I am sore\nobliged to confess to feeling mortified as\nto the frightful expenditure on victuals,\npresents and the like that this modern\nChristmas does entail. Contrariwise, I do\nhear tell as how in this new era, infant\nmortality is all but vanished, that the pox\nhas been greatly curbed and that every\nman's dwelling is warm and dry and\nlighted, such that they do more resemble a place fit for habitation by God's children and not the mortuary. And what's more besides, we would not be obliged\nto eat stringy goose flesh and this disgusting f iggy pudding, neither would it\nbe incumbent 'pon us to stand around\nglowing braziers roasting chestnuts to\nkeep from freezing to death\"). By the\nsame token it's a mistake to assume that\ncommercial is ation of the festive season\nis a phenomenon of the post-war era. It's a little-known fact, but Santa, the main\nman himself, is only pictured wearing red\nbecause of the demands of the marketing department of Coca-Cola - before\nthey ran a Christmas ad campaign featuring the said Mr Glaus in the 1920s, he\nwas in fact clad in green.\nI'm with Bob Cratchct on one thing\nthough. I don't have anything against fiscal and dietary excess per so (and I will\nbe enjoying plenty of food and drink\nthis Christmas, never fear) but when\nattending someone's birthday party, it is\ncustomary at least to make a token reference to the guest of honour. As every\ninfant school child knows, Christmas is\nfundamentally about the birth of someone who a significant percentage of all\nthe people born in the last 2000 years\nbelieve was the Son of God. I well\nremember the sense of wonder that I felt\non hearing the Christmas story for the\nfirst time (although the moment was\nslightly spoiled by my being publicly censured for remarking, on learning of the\ndifficulties experienced by Mary and\nJoseph when trying to find a place to stay\nin Bethlehem, that it was silly of them not\nto make a reservation in advance as\nhotels are always chock-a block at Christmas). That feeling of special n css has\nnever left me. As this is a column and not\na sermon, I will say no more save to\nnote that it is now widely considered\nunacceptable to use the word \"Christ-mas\" when referring to the event. In\nAmerica for instance they call it the \"hol-i day season\", which considering some of\nthe other things they've done to the language must rate as a lucky escape. But\nI was shocked to learn that in Birmingham (England, not Alabama) it has been\ndecreed that Christmas should now be\nknown as \"Winterval\" for fear of causing\noffence to followers of other belief systems. Whilst attempts at religious tolerance are laudable, this strikes me as\nbeing a bit OTT. I don't feel in the slightest bit threatened by Hindus celebrating\nDivali, adherents to Judaism having\nHanukkah or Moslems from observing\nthe festival of Ramadan and I get the\nfeeling that the motivation behind the\nrenaming of the festival associated with\nthe birth of Christ arises more from overzealous political correctness than in\nresponse to the real concerns of non-Christian groups. A close friend of mine,\nwho is a follower of Islam, is of the same\nopinion - you can take things too far. He\nand I might not be from the same religious background, but on this point we\nsee eye to eye - even if we don't meet\nfaith to faith.\nSo let me wish you all the very best\nfor the holidays. I'm sure we'll all find our\nown way to enjoy Christmas, which is\nhow it should be, but I hope that\namongst all the fun you'd find just a little time to join me in raising a glass to\nthe birthday boy. Incidentally, you'll be\npleased to know that I finally found that\nCD for my grandma - \"Daniel O 'Donnell\nand Jimmy Page - Together Again\". She'll\nhate the music, but love the sweaters\nthey're wearing.\n\n"

    "content": "26\nFOCUS\n16 December 1998\nBring Back Back Beat! Augustin de Bettignies looks at the raid on the Back Beat Club earlier this month, and asks whether such aggressive police\naction is really the best way to deal with the drugs problem in Britain...\nOn Tuesday 1 December five hundred\nLondon Police officers made a quasi-mil-it ary assault on a club in a back street off\nCharing Cross Road, in the most important or rather aggressive anti-drugs operation in the capital ever. Back Beat club\nwas under discrete police surveillance for\nfive months for being suspected of being\nal at ge scale drug den. The place was\nknown by an increasing number of people of all ages for being an important\ncomplex were cannabis could freely be\nbought and smoked. The seizure was\nactually quite disappointing for such a major operation: 'only' \u00a3100,000 of\ncannabis (herb & hash) and \u00a370,000 of\ncash were reported by spokesmen.\nThis 'raid' opens yet another debate\non the use of cannabis as a recreational\ndrug. Developed countries have led a 'war on drugs' for the past forty years, by\nrepressing consumption, especially in\nthe US where they have in fact sent\nplanes to bum down fields in Columbia.\nBut no approach has managed to effectively do something about the 'drug phe-nomen on'. In fact, the number of users\nhas never stopped increasing.\nSo maybe we could try to think about\nthe philosophy behind the use of recreational drugs. Diverse\nplants and mushrooms\ncontaining mentally active\nsubstances were used in\nthe most ancient civilisations during rituals to\n'enlighten' minds and\nbring people together, and even Aldous\nHuxley thought of his 'ideal' society in\n\"Brave New World\" being based on the\nuniversal but limited use of a drug to\nensure the happiness of the people and\npublic order. So why are governments so\nkeen on repressing the use of recre-\"...people do\nand will always\nsmoke dope...\"\nat ional drugs? Why are drugs illegal? The\n'official' answer is that most drugs affect\npublic health and can lead to death,\nbol h in the long and short term. But the\nother answer is that the money going\ninto the drugs industry is money being\npumped out of the business cycle, and\nreduces the consumption of manufactured, taxed products; thus\nreducing growth and\nemployment. Some say\n\"why not legal is e cannabis\nlike the Netherlands?\" so\nthat the State would make\nmoney, with which it could\nmaybe fight more efficiently against\n'harder' drugs, as cannabis is now recognised to be less harmful than tobacco\nand alcohol. However, most governments are very far from the idea of adopting a similar drug policy to that of the\nNetherlands (that has actually proven to\nbe 'positive' as there are similar proportions of smokers and (hard) drug addicts\nin Holland as there are in its neighbouring countries). Actions like the one carried out earlier this month confirm how\nBritish drug policy is stubbornly kept as\nstupidly repressive as ever.\nThe point is, even without changing\nthe law, although it is being quite hypo-critical, as people do and will always\nsmoke dope, why not tolerate places\nsuch as the Back Beat dub? Only an esoteric community of people 'already into\nit' went there, as the place was difficult\nto find and know about, and practiced\ntheir favourite hobby without harming\nsociety in any other way. They were\nNOT buying booze on friday nights, and\nlittering the streets with cans, broken\nglass, piss and puke...\nS^&t.OUT~\\ SHOW YQU\u00a3.\nKit Ar*\u20ac\nMiNOfctTf\nt\\\\|Axi Vfl\" rv r\\'W SO \"4 is MO^ X6W AT Of- A Ifc . |\nrV\n1 I IV T'IN6, ft s cfM't'i fifi oh i, \u2022 ItS0 M \u00a3 IN.\nIt\nTHIS IS A SOC i AL.< im,\nALONt,._\nV t/r\" TOO\nVPs*\n-nil fs n Tfk. \\\\W~&*Y mFx P \u00a3 ; C7^0\\\\\\:M O i/i'.~'<(.,*\\ Ac'd Lt cT it of:\\*;:: y. fi-t> ce,\\* "

    "content": "16 December 1998 Editorial 7\nTime's Up for CCUs\nThere's trouble brewing, make no mis-take. Mr King's letter on page six shows\nthat the bubble, which many of us knew\nhad burst weeks ago, has finally settled\nin a soapy mess. Badly constructed\nmetaphors aside, Mr Gayed must\nrespond to thc comments and accusations made as soon as the Spring term\nbegins. May I suggest that he thinks very\ncarefully about what he wants to say in\nhis defence. This is not the same as asking him to 'consider his position'. I have\nno opinion on the subject - I am not a medic and as such have no right to suggest a course of action. That decision is\nfor Mr Gayed, and those that elected\nhim, to make.\nIt is not only ICSMSU that has to do\nsome hard thinking, however. May I suggest that all CCU exec members read\nDavid Hellard's column this week. I think\nthe message is clear enough - thc CCUs\ncould be an important and lively part of\nstudent life at IC, but only if they are correctly managed and don't isolate themselves from ICU. Us sabbaticals (well,\nDave and Chris anyway) are here to help.\nUse us and thc facilities the Union has\nto offer before it's too late. I'm sure this\nis an unnecessary reminder, as you\nundoubtedly read Dave's column every\nweek anyway...\nHow do Drugs Feature\nI can assure you that wasn't the idea.\nDeadlines are deadlines, however, and\nprinters are very keen on them. For\nsome reason drugs seemed so much\neasier to write about than museums,\ngalleries, parks and the like. You can\nfind out about that stuff in guide books\nanyway. I would like to point out that\nnot all of that feature was written from\npersonal experience - it was an amalgamation of many friends' tales (well,\na few at any rate).\nSeriously, though, I don't think people realise how easy and relatively cheap\nit can be to get out of London for a weekend. Amsterdam is just one of several places you can go to for a weekend\ncosting \u00a3150 or less (not much when you\nconsider a decent Friday night out in the\nWest End can cost \u00a320-30). Nearer to\nhome there's always Edinburgh and\nother such cities (Newcastle and Bristol\nspring to mind) that are definitely worth\na visit.\nOh, and before you guys in college\nstart complaining that I am encouraging\nthe consumption of illicit drugs, consider\nthis. People are going to take them\nwhether you like it or not. Now they can\neither take substances of uncertain composition on or around college premises,\nor save up their Dionysian tendencies for\na hedonistic weekend in I loll and where\nit's safer and legal. I know which I would\nprefer.\nChristmas? So soon?!\nIt seems mere days ago that I was lying\non a cliff in Dorset basking in the weekend sun on the hottest day of the year.\nMoving on from my ever-slowing body\nclock, however, is it me or did Christmas\nadvertising start even earlier this year?\nIt won't be long before special price\nChristmas hampers are sold in the January sales and Easter Eggs come with\nfree mince pic s. Anyway, I hope you all\nget your Christmas cards out OK - for\nthose of you who don't know, the last\ndate for UK 2nd class post is this Friday\n(1st class next Tuesday), so you'd better get a move on...\nThe first years among you are\nundoubtedly looking forward to going\nhome and telling your parents how much\nknowledge you've gained, and your\nmates how many people you've pulled\n(or not, as the case may be). Well, you've\nsurvived a term here. Don't worry, only\neight, eleven or more to go. Those of\nyou with exams early next term have my\ndeepest sympathies. Those of you off\nskiing for a week (or the Middle East, Mr\nIi ellard) have my strongest curses. Break\na leg. I mean it.\nThank you and goodbye\nI was going to talk about philosophy (re\nthe Nietzsche feature on page twenty-eight), but I can't be bothered at\n7.30am so it can wait till next term. If\nyou're offended by it, please don't come complaining to me. Write a feature on Thomas Aquinas instead.\nBefore I go, a few thankyou s. Firstly, thanks to the people who\nemailed me regarding the possibility\nof using Linux (gosh, that non-Microsoft\no peta ting system is getting good publicity in these two pages, isn't it?) to tun\nthe Feltx network. If I can run thc server\non il while keeping NT on the terminals\nI'd be very happy. Answers on a post\n(or Christmas) card.\nI would like to thank all of you who\nhave been involved with Felix this term\n- you've helped make the first eleven\nissues this year a damn sight easier\nthan I expected. Special thanks goes to\nJon Trout, for designing this issue's cover; Andrew Ofori, for taking care of\nnews even when there isn't any; Helena\nCochcme, for being determined to finish the arts pages even if it is past 2am and, most of all, to David Roberts, for\nwriting, laying-out and proof-reading\nanything and everything, regardless of\nthe time or his physics degree. Cheers\nalso to all at MCP Litho for putting up\nwith my late arrivals every Thursday.\nAbsolutely no thanks to all those advertisers who handed ads in late / on mac\ndiscs / in the wrong format, but cheers\nfor paying.\nThat's it from me. If anyone wants\nme, I'm back on 4 January. Merry Christmas, and don't eat all the pies.
