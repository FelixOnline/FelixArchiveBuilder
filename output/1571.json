    "content": "Imperial College prove too strong for\nImperial Medics\nRanjodh Sanghera\u2019s heroics for the Medics were in vain as the\nMedics Basketball team succumbed to a classy College.\nKunal Wagle\nSports Editor\nO\nn Friday 28th\nFebruary Imperial\ndescended on the\nCopper Box (the\nbeloved stadium\nin the Queen Elizabeth II Olympic\nPark) to watch one of the most highly\nanticipated clashes of the year. But\nbefore the London Lions match there\nwas the small matter of the College\nplaying against the Medics in the first\nVarsity clash of the year.\nThe College got ahead early and\nstayed ahead, with the Medics\nstruggling to match them. College\nmanaged to surge ahead to a 22-8 lead\nafter the first quarter, and from then\non Medics were always playing catch-up. At half time the lead had begun to\nstretch, with the College taking a 36-17 cushion into the half-time break.\nDespite a strong start to the second\nhalf from the Medics, the College\ncontinued to move ahead (despite a\nlack of discipline leading to many free\nthrows), before they sealed the game\nin the final quarter at a convincing 62-36.\nDue to a lack of signposts at the\nOlympic Park, the Felix reporting\nteam only reached the Copper Box in\ntime for the second quarter, in time to\nwitness a key moment in the game \u2013\na shootout between the two mascots\n\u2013 Victoria and Albert. When they\ncouldn\u2019t be separated after five throws\neach (none had reached the basket, let\nalone gone in) there was a roar from\nthe crowd as the players replaced\nthem on the court for the second\nquarter.\nAt the start of the quarter the Medics\nenjoyed a good spell of possession\nnear the College basket, but were\nunable to translate this into points on\nthe board, and soon found themselves\nconceding again. Unfortunately for\nthem, this was to be the story for most\nof their evening. It was now 26-8.\nThe other main theme for the\nevening was the ill discipline of the\nCollege as they defended. The Medics\nclawed their way back into the quarter\nfrom the resulting free throws, and\neventually the score was back to 26-12 with just over four minutes to go\nin the second quarter. However, it\nwas not just the medics who were\nbenefiting from carelessness at the\nback. Restarting after gifting the\ncollege a point from a foul, a simple\npass was fluffed, and the College were\nable to slot home for yet another 3\npoints. Yet again, a spell of pressure\nby the Medics had only resulted in the\nCollege stretching their lead.\nThe Medics were not able to take\nadvantage of more free throws that\ncame their way, and the College\nwere pleased to hear the half-time\nwhistle blow \u2013 but that was not before\nthe College\u2019s number 7, Thomas\nDefferriere had slotted another 3\npointer for the leaders. It was 36-17 at\nhalf-time.\nThe half time entertainments\nconsisted of the London Lions\ncheerleaders dazzling the crowd with\none of their dance routines. However\nthis was quickly eclipsed by an\nimpromptu dance off between the two\nmascots. After a few minutes, it was\nclear that the Medics (represented\nby Victoria) had just shaded it. It was\nto be the only battle that the Medics\nwould win all evening.\nClearly the Medics coach had given\nhis team a grilling, as they came out\nfor the third quarter all guns blazing.\nInspired by their forward, number 13\nRanjodh Sanghera (who had been so\nfar the one shining light in the Medics\u2019\nperformance), the Medics were able to\npost seven unanswered points within\nthe first two minutes of the third\nquarter, leading a worried College\ncoach to call a time-out with 7:40 to\ngo.\nAfter receiving the hair-dryer\ntreatment from their coach (although\nhow he could possibly have had a hair-dryer courtside I don\u2019t know), College\nstarted to find their feet in the quarter\nand started to put some points on the\nboard. At this stage the Medics had\nno answer to the College\u2019s rebounds,\nand they were able to slot away points\nat will. But it was the same old story\nat the back for the College as they\ngave away foul after foul after foul.\nLuckily for them, with the exception\nof Sanghera, the Medics didn\u2019t look\nlike scoring from any of the resulting\nfree throws, resulting in the lead being\nkept safe. In fact, the Medics then\nsuffered from a very poor final minute,\nas the College added six unanswered\npoints to take a lead of 22 points into\nthe final break.\nThe final bit of entertainment\nprovided was a shootout between a\nmember of the College and a medic\nfrom the crowd. However, because\nthe standard of this shootout was even\nworse than the shootout between\nmascots Victoria and Albert, it\u2019s\nprobably best to gloss over this one.\nThe Medics needed a fast start if\nthey wanted to win the game, and\nwhilst it briefly looked as though they\nmight just manage that, it quickly\nbecame clear that they were going to\nfall short. The College were able to\nshut down the game very effectively,\nwith no change in the lead after\nthe first five minutes of the final\nquarter. With just a few minutes to\ngo the College provided a play that\ndescribed the game in a nutshell.\nWith the medics laying siege on the\nCollege basket, the College were able\nto weather the storm and then break\naway, force a foul and then register a\npoint of their own. After this the lead\nkept stretching, and it was clear that\nit was game over. This didn\u2019t stop the\nStadium announcer from continuing\nin his regular gusto, especially when\nhe commented to people in the crowd\nwho were wearing cut-outs of the\nplayers, \u201cI\u2019ve just realised you guys\nhave brought face cut-outs with you.\nYou guys are some of the best fans\never\u201d.\nThe rest of the game passed without\nmuch incident and the College were\nable to complete a regulation 62-36\nvictory to put the Medics in their\nplace. Sanghera deservedly took the\nGolden Basketball for his role of MVP,\nbut unfortunately for the medics, the\nrest of their team were no match for\na classy, yet ruthless Imperial College.\nOntherightareaselectionofphotos\nfrom the Basketball all credit Jack\nElkington/Felix Sport.\nBASKETBALL\n\n"

Maybe, if luck\nwill have it, you manage\nto make love sideways to the rhythm\nof Mandy and Stella Artoorhys in\nDalston or Metric. But sadly, London\ncan be a bit of a \u2018les incompetents\u2019 in\nthis department. It can fail to deliver\nthe goods.\nWe want a sustained but simple per-formance: great music, cheap drinks\nthat don\u2019t cost an arm and a trip to\nA&E, and above all: \u2018livid gash\u2019 as my\nAustralian-Berliner acquaintance puts\nit. We wanna vibe and be vibed \u2013 it\u2019s a\ndog eat dog world out there.\nPeople also tell me that what I just\noutlined is delivered by Berlin in a\ncompetent manner. So I, Jonny Mitigation and Charles Rotknap, a dear\nraver of mine, set sail \u2018nach Berlin\u2019 one\nfateful January night. One Terravision\nbus to Stansted, one \u2018Ryan F*****g A\u2019\nflight; we cheekily fondled Berlin. If\nmy memory serves me right,it was a\nFriday morning that we arrived in the\nvicinity of Kreuzberg, Berlin.\nBerlin: A Night Life Review\nJonny Mitigation\nAnonymous\nnight and leave Monday morning just\nin time for work (did somebody say\nMandy?).\nIt\u2019s electric \u2013 but we need to amp\nthe wattage. Charles befriends a fellow\nraver: so smooth, so Berlin-esque of\nhim. Turns out to our no-surprise,\nthe fellow has 10 euro Mandy. Yes,\nplease. The judgment might be cloudy,\nthe price very low, but we take the\nskeptical plunge. 40 more minutes\nof dancing and it hits. And oh my, it\nhits. The warm fuzzy feeling of loving\neveryone and everything envelops us,\nsuffocating our inhibitions. We dance\n\u2018hosto\u2019, we were ready to repeat the\nexperience, but different venues. And\nwe had ample of choice: we went\nfor \u2018Mein Haus am See\u2019. This bar is\nlike no others: it proudly displays a\nsign: \u2018Hippies are welcome\u2019. You see,\nBerlin can have a darker side: with\nthe recent budding of the Hipster\nculture mixed with remnants of the\nBeatnik movement, it can be a bit\nxenophobic. The sign basically says:\n\u2018oi haters, keep accepting that money\ntourism brings to you, but order these\nhipsters around into a confined space\nso they don\u2019t \u2018bother\u2019 you anymore\u2019.\nVilifying any group of people for any\nreason is dangerous and abhorrent:\ntreat everyone as an individual. Is it\nnot what \u2018hipsterism\u2019 kinda espouses\nyou might say? Ha, I wish but let\u2019s be\nhonest: they are all just facsimiles of\neach other, fancying Echo Park to be a\ndesert island is crazy talk.\nI am putting brakes on my belief\nin \u2018radical individualism\u2019 akin to Ayn\nRand, so let\u2019s talk venue. It\u2019s brilliant,\nless personal and more commercial,\nbut still with style and grace. On a\npersy note, I still prefer \u2018Lerchen und\nEulen\u2019 \u2013 it simply is unmatched. It\u2019s\na place that on our very last night\nbefore the flight in the morning,\nTuesday 2am stays open upon asking\nthe bartender who serves us superb\ncocktails, talks, shares cigarettes and\n\u2018alcohol knowledge\u2019 (FYI, it is a 24/7\nplace but closes when no customers\nare there).\nTime flies, and we get on the\nmove towards Stattbad, our night\u2019s\ndestination. On the way, we manage\nto get lost in a pharmaceutical\nfactory of Bayer (this is thanks to our\ninebriation, not the \u2018basically-free\u2019\n24/7 Berlin tube system). We never\nwaste an opportunity: we use it to\nespouse our love for Professor Nutt,\ncalling him affectionately: \u2018Hazey\nDavo\u2019, \u2018Queasy Davo\u2019 or \u2018Sun, Sex and\nSuspicious Davo\u2019 to name a few. No\none is confused.\nAfter a while, we make it to Stattbad:\nthis is a club like no other (seems\nlike a pattern with Berlin). A 50s\nHaving settled ourselves into\na drengy yet surprisingly comfy\n\u2018hosto\u2019, we hit the sights. We\u2019re\njonesing through the usuals, ever\nso gentile Bundestag (why the\nhaze do you have massive queues\nmanned by sporadic ticket office\nmen?), art exhibitions (where East\nmeets West), historic squats (f***\nGreenpeace for wrecking the vibe),\nmassive statutes of Soviet liberators\n(I have a selfie where I promptly\nflip them off) and rounding off the\nafternoon with a generous helping\nof Curry Wurst.\nEnough with this hedonistic\nchauvinism, I say: no more\ndistractions to the storyline. That\nvery evening, we proceed to get\nlashed on Jager and Juice and\nhit \u2018Lerchen und Eulen\u2019. This is\na \u2018F*** ME KINDA SIDEWAYS\u2019\nestablishment that serves the best\nMoscow Mules and splendid Swiss\ncigarettes to be enjoyed indoors\n(Parisienne). All for a measly few\nEuros. The vibe of the place is\nmesmerizing, Berliners friendly\nas ever sporting phenomenally\ncrafted \u2018Mutze\u2019s (including myself,\nminus the Berliner part, but hey, I\nfelt like I was at home). AND you can\nget a Larry David sandwich: white\nfish, sabel, capers, onions, and cream\ncheese. It was as if I got killed in a\ndrive-by Biggie-style, went to heaven\nFat Boy Slim-style and back.\nAs we prep to leave \u2018Lerchen und\nEulen\u2019 for Tresor, I acquaint a striking\n18 year old brunette who, thanks\nto the ensuing conversation and\nample amounts of bisexual tension,\nbecame vigorously passionate. The\nculmination of the said interaction\nwas as per usual with me: a humble\nexchange of business cards. Her name\nis Sabrina and she sells shower curtain\nrings by day. Catch of the day.\nFinally, we made it to Tresor. On\nthe way, I managed to violate some\nsubsections of my parole agreement,\nbecause after all, I act like a cop, I look\nlike a cop, heck, I must be a cop! Oh I\nnearly forgot: we also met Ben Klock\nin McDonald\u2019s beforehand: a resident\ntechno god who said we would get\ninto Berghain, bare easy. Easy does it.\nNo more dilly-dallying, time to talk\nTresor. Where do I start: maybe with\nthe fact that it is a pioneer of the post-89 Berlin scene set in an industrial\npower station, or that we got a 50%\ndiscount for looking berlin-ish? Here\u2019s\na top tip: whilst waiting, don\u2019t speak\nEnglish, don\u2019t talk to people, wear\nall black, have piercings, maybe a\ntattoo, hide being lashed well IF you\nhope to get in. Oh, and best have a\nhot girl with you, then it should be no\nproblem. And try to look older, at least\nlate 20s. I know, I hate pseudo-rules as\nmuch as the next guy. But hey, this is\nBerlin, so no much choice \u2013 this is a\ncalculated loss because what awaits\ninside is divine and an anti-thesis to\nthe outside\u2019s excesses. The inside of\nTresor is spectacular: multiple levels,\nfamous foggy dark tunnels, booming\nGerman techno, studded enclaves\nwith fascinating people \u2013 everything\nlit in dim red lights. We get drinks \u2013\nMate it Gin \u2013 the best mixer possible.\nWe light up. We close our eyes. We\ndance. It is a trance to be repeated.\nSo much so, that the most dedicated\nmembers enter Tresor on Friday\nmanically, clenching our jaws, and\nfilming it with a GoPro \u2013 we are like\nthat maniac from Flashdance, that\nsteel town girl, who danced her heart\nout and danced herself into that place\nin dancing school. Sure, we tumble a\nfew times like she did \u2013 but that does\nnot deter us. We are Maniacs. If even\njust for tonight.\nNext phase enters after replenishing\nour dehydrated bodies: chinning the\nwag. Discussing Kierkegaard with\nCarlotta was an experience, talking\nto Nina about Isaiah Berlin (what a\ncoincidence!) was revolutionary. Mr\nRotknap was a hit too although he\nchose to talk techno, making industry\ncontacts \u2013 by that stage he was more\naware than me of where we were, who\nwe were. Actually who were we?\nGod knows. We coasted like this till\n8am, savouring every second, hitting\nan after-party. It was glorious, when\nthe dust settled, to be able to tuck\ninto a Kebab so tasty, I would give it\na Michelin star on the spot. Go for\nDurum rather than Doner: wrap is\neasier to tackle than a bap.\nNap and shower later in the\nconverted leisure centre, with raves\ninside the pool, industrial Bauhaus\ninfrastructure, heating rooms etc.\nThis is heavenly \u2013 Berlin Boiler Room\nbroadcasts from there. Needless to\nsay, this was a night equally splendid\nto Tresor, minus that great feeling of\nloosing your Berlin virginity we had\nyesterday. My Dad says that what\nyou do first, is usually most beautiful.\nTongue in cheek at worst, true at best.\n10am and we make it to Berghain.\nIt is something you have to do but\nthere can be no slip-ups. Notoriously\namazing, secretive and sexual, it\nis a sight: old Stasi prison 10 or so\nfloors high that became the world\u2019s\ngreatest techno club. Just a testament\nto hedonism. I will leave it to the\nimagination of the readers as to what\nhappened there. One word of advice:\nknow your exits and entries.\nComing back in early hours of\nmorning was fun: filming Jackassesque challenges whilst downing\nkebabs after kebabs. I will never forget\nthat morning and the breakfast we had\nin our \u2018hosto\u2019. We slept for a day and\na half.\nTo spare the agony of making this\narticle into a tractate, I shall quickly\nwhirl through the rest of events. That\nweek, we got to see Kater Holzig out\non a final night, meet zestful divorcees\nin Berliner Philharmonic, nip into\nPoznan, Poland for a friend\u2019s house\nparty, vandalise the Berlin Wall with\nironic/iconic Instagrams, see medical\nhistory museum with headless babies,\nget student discounts in Benihana and\nother unreal malarkey.\nSo what is the moral of this story?\nWell, Berlin is quite amazing, the\nbest city to be young. And it gets\neven better in summer: all we did in\na week is scratch the surface. Here\nis what we\u2019re gonna do: if this article\nappealed to you and wanna join me,\nJonny Mitigation, Charles Rotknap\nand DJ Principal Goodvibes (another\ndear raver of mine) for a July in Berlin,\ndrop us an email at whydontyoufind\nfriendsonbeboorfriendster@\ngmail.com\ntheloftberlin.com\n\n"

    "content": "20 FRIDAY 07 MAR\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPeter Brook\nTreasured Writer\nPaul Thomas Anderson is the spiritual son of Martin Scorsese, he reflects many of the styles and themes\nof Scorsese\u2019s work whilst adding and\nrefining to make a style that is very\nmuch his own. Their similarities include the penchant for long tracking\ntakes, the style of epic multi-character\nstories and along side this many mo-tifs, including the powerful adopted\nfather figures.\nPTA\u2019s early career began with Hard\nEight (Sydney in the UK) a masterpiece\nof dialogue and intrigue following this\nwith Boogie Nights and Magnolia,\nboth immense in scope and complexity multicast pieces. Following this,\nthere was an interlude with the endearing Punch-Drunk Love (possibly\nAdam Sandler\u2019s only good film) before\npushing onto two single character lead\nfilms with There Will Be Blood (which\nwon Best Actor at the Oscars for Daniel Day-Lewis) and The Master (with\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin\nPhoenix). These final two films are\nboth draped with ideas of faith.\nDirector Masterclass: Paul Thomas Anderson (1)\nHard Eight (1996)\nHard Eight opens with John C. Reilly\u2019s character on the steps of a diner\nas Philip Baker Hall\u2019s Sydney opens\nwalks up to him and offers him a cof-fee. The opening 10 minutes of dialogue is probably the most intriguing\nand quick moving introductions to\ntwo characters I have ever seen. Both\nactors have opportunity to shine as\nSydney takes the trepidatious John\nC. Reilly to Vegas to show him how\nto make some money. This dynamic\nof the adoptive father figure can be\nseen throughout his filmography, very\nspecifically in Boogie Nights and The\nBoogie Nights (1997)\nThis film is just a cataclysmic event\nin film, it follows the life of porn\nstar Dirk Diggler getting his first job\nin porn, to the highs of his career in\nthe mid-seventies, to the terrible 80s\nwhen his life starts to fall apart. Every\nera has a massive tracking shot around\na big party showing the characters\nmingling, interacting and it gives us\nan opportunity to reflect on how their\ncomplex lives are unfolding, a club\nowner who wants to be in movies, a\nstereo salesman who just won\u2019t let the\ncowboy aesthetic go\u2026\nReally this is an epic that focusses on\nDirk Diggler played by Mark Wahlberg\ngrowing up in the wrong crowd, who\u2019s\nambitions start pure, well as pure as\nmaking pornos with \u2018real storylines\u2019\ncan be. And on New Year\u2019s Eve 1980,\nthings start to go wrong, he tries cocaine for the first time and goes from\nbeing very affluent to trying to hustle\nMagnolia (1999)\nAnother multi-character epic that has\nno fixed narrative, but relies on weird\ncoincidental links between a wonderful cast including Philip Seymour\nHoffman, Tom Cruise, John C. Reilly,\nWilliam H. Macy and an outstanding\nJulianne Moore. The opening (watch\nit on Youtube), which kind of has\nnothing to do with the plot of the film\ntakes three true stories about completely unlikely coincidences and sets\nthem up against what you are about\nto witness. There are so many writers\nthat struggle to make one character\ninteresting, and PTA manages to write\nabout 10 totally compelling characters\nthat have so much depth, history and\ntruth to them. We follow Tom Cruise,\na man who runs Pick Up Artist semi-nars, William H. Macy as a former\n\u2018What do kids know?\u2019 TV champion\nand Julianne Moore, a trophy wife dependant on Xanex to get through the\nday, has to collect drugs for her dying\nhusband. How these stories are re-lated, and the strange events that get\nthem there, really let us get inside the\nheads of these characters.\nPunch-Drunk Love (2002)\nPunch-Drunk Love is the only film in\nPTA filmography which runs under an\nhour and half and has a tone and style\nvery much of it\u2019s own. It is also one of\nthe few films that I have enjoyed with\nAdam Sandler in. It follows Sandler,\nplaying Barry Egman, who seems to\nsuffer from a crippling anxiety after\ngrowing up with seven overbearing\nand cruelly teasing sisters. His anxiety leads to him violently lashing out\nat inanimate objects. He is otherwise\nsweet and conscientious. Again, the\ncoincidental finding of a small piano,\na phone call to a phone sex line to talk\nabout life leading to him being embroiled in blackmail attempts. There\nare also many other elements from\nthe performance that make this movie\nMaster, and in Scorsese\u2019s Gangs of New\nYork, Mean Streets and Goodfellas.\nAnother nod to Scorsese\u2019s Goodfellas\u2019\nCoco Cabana tracking shot is the first\nshot we see of as we walk around the\ncasino, and it is just glorious!\nThere is one scene which probably\nhas more intrigue than anything I\u2019ve\never seen before. Sydney has been\ncalled to a motel room where something has gone wrong with John C.\nReilly\u2019s character, and for the longest\ntime all we can see is Sydney\u2019s face\nas he looks in the room talking with\nthose inside. It makes you shift in\nyour seat so as to try to see around\nthe frame of the screen into the room\ndrug dealers out of money (one of the\nmost stressful scenes in the movie, fire\ncrackers being let off by a high kid not\nonly puts the characters on edge, but\nput everyone in the room into physical states of discomfort and tension).\nAlongside the wonderful characters\nwe also get a soundtrack that is just\nthe best of the 70s, so make sure you\nhave the speakers turned up to 11.\nAgain, we have some strange and\nwonderful acts of genius coincidence\nthat make the world seem so real and\nexciting; we also get a strong adoptive\nfather relationship between Dirk and\nthe porn baron who brings him into\nthis world and makes him rich. Really\nan amazing cast, from Philip Seymour\nHoffman (who appeared in all but\none of PTAs films except There Will\nBe Blood) playing a lonely and weird\nrunner in the porn world, to Julieanne\nMoore, Burt Reynolds, John C. Reilly\nand William H. Macy. Next week, I will conclude by talking about There Will Be Blood and The Master\nyourself. The excitement and terror at\nthat moment was incredible.\nFinally, an idea that follows us\nthrough this film and into Magnolia\nis this idea of coincidence; JCR\u2019s character opens with a story about why\nhe can\u2019t light his cigarette because\nhe refuses to carry matches as once\na packet spontaneously exploded in\nhis pocket. It incites a laugh at first,\nbut also offers the audience to accept\nother weird spontaneous situations\nlater in the story, as we are primed\nto remember that weird things really\ndo happen. This idea takes to another\nlevel in Magnolia\u2026\nwonderful, we have superb cinematography and just beautifully designed\nshots. The shot of Barry finally kissing his love in a silhouetted, busy hotel is breathtaking and the movie has\nintermissions include impressionist\nstyle video art, which, along with the\ncostumes and sets, creates a beautifully vivid world in which Barry lives.\nRoger Ebert, the renowned film critic,\nsaid of Sandler in this film \u201cSandler,\nliberated from the constraints of for-mula, reveals unexpected depths as an\nactor. Watching this film, you can imagine him in Dennis Hopper roles. He\nhas darkness, obsession and power.\nHe can\u2019t go on making those moronic\ncomedies forever, can he?\u201d Unfortunately, with the benefit of hindsight\nwe know that Ebert was wrong\u2026 Jack\nand Jill\u2026\n\n"

    "content": "11\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 07 MAR\nCOMMENT\nManifesto: Place in Marxist Thought\nT\no round up my three weeks\nof commentary on the\nManifesto, I shall try and\nplace it in Marxist thought. I\nwas originally going to write\na short critique of Marxist thought but\nit quickly grew to an unreadable length\nand so I have settled for this slightly\nless ambitious task. Thus this text is\nhalf criticism, half recommendations\nfor further reading. Before I start on\nthe meat of the discussion I should\nsay that in 1848 Marx had begun but\nby no means finished his study of\npolitical economy and so we should\nnot place too much emphasis on the\nrelative lack of \u2018economic essentialism\u2019\nin the Manifesto; the outline of history\nin the preface of the Contribution\nwas substantially the same as in the\nManifesto, but the economic claims\nwere stronger.\nThere is still, though, a\nrather crude and mechanical account\nof the development of ideas, in the\nManifesto: \u2018The ruling ideas of each\nage have ever been the ideas of the\nruling class.\u2019 Taken literally, this means\nthat Communism will only become\na ruling idea when the proletarians\nhave taken power, or worse, that\nit is already only a bourgeois idea.\nMarx does make room for immanent\ncriticism, \u2018when people speak of ideas\nthat revolutionise society, they do\nbut express the fact, that within the\nold society, the elements of the new\none have been created.\u2019 However\nthere is no denying that what we\nmight call the theory of ideology in\nthe Manifesto remains in the domain\n\u2018vulgar Marxism\u2019. In their defence, it\nshould be added that Marxists have a\nvirtual monopoly on the sophisticated\ndiscussions of ideology.\nA full discussion of ideology\nis quite impossible here, so I will leave\nit at the somewhat unsatisfactory\ncomments above and move onto\nthe main practical criticisms of the\nManifesto. Put briefly, these criticisms\nare about the theory of politics, the\n\u2018national question\u2019, the role of women\nand the role of class.\nThese four categories, I believe,\ncan all be subsumed under three\nmore general criticisms of Marxism\nin general, though I will not discuss\nthese extensively here: the criticism\nof Marxist teleology, politics and once\nagain ideology. It can be seen that\nthere is some overlap; for instance,\nthe theory of politics in the Manifesto\nrelates to the overall Marxist discourse\non politics, as well as the reality of\nsocialist political praxis. Similarly,\ncategories 2), 3) and 4) all relate in\nvarious degrees to both the Marxist\ntheory of politics and ideology,\nthough I believe it is important to\ndistinguish the two. My final brief\ncomment about these more general\ncriticisms is that, though the central\nproblem for Marxist thinkers today is\nthe nature of a political subject, that is,\na problematic of politics and ideology,\nthe ultimate problem for Marxism has\nand always will be whether or not it is\nteleological.\n1) The Theory of Politics.\nUltimately, there is no theory of\npolitics in Marx. Certainly, the vague\npractical recommendations in the\nManifesto at best suggest that people\nshould be pragmatic and analyze the\nconcrete historical situation. While\nin the 1872 preface Marx and Engels\nhistorical situation was not yet ready.\nGramsci, however, has perhaps the\nbest political sense of any Marxist\nthinker, with a theory of hegemony\nnot unlike Foucault\u2019s discussion of\npower. The precise mechanism for this\nstruggle for hegemony, however, has I\nbelieve been best formulated by post-Marxist thinkers Ernesto Laclau and\nChantal Mouffe in their brilliant book\nHegemony and Socialist Strategy\nlooking at the way discursive fields\nbecome \u2018overdetermined\u2019 by certain\nhegemonic interpretations of words\nand phrases.\n2) The National Question.\nIn the Manifesto the role of\nnationalism in politics had a somewhat\nsummary treatment. The Manifesto\nitself is staunchly internationalist,\nthough it quite unconsciously accepts\nhave realized that simply seizing\ncapitalist modes of production is not\nenough, and while in the Critique of\nthe Gotha program Marx uses the\nrather enigmatic phrase \u2018dictatorship\nof the proletariat\u2019 there is still no\nreal theory of politics. Lenin gets\nsomewhat closer, in a practical sense\nwith the creation of vanguard parties,\nand in a more profound sense with\nwhat might be called a theory of\naction, which Rosa Luxembourg\nspells out best in her criticism of\nthe Mensheviks refusal to revolt on\nthe grounds that Russia\u2019s objective\nwhen striking over working\nconditions. Much of the early Marxist\ndiscussion of the national question\nsuffers from the then ubiquitous\nerror in taking nations to be as old as\ntime immemorial (nations in general\nnot particular nations like Germany\nor Italy which were clearly recent\ninventions). Serious scholarship\non nations did not come until the\nflurry of books in Britain in the 80s,\nthe best being Benedict Anderson\u2019s\nbook Imagined Communities and the\ncollection edited by Eric Hobsbawm\nand Terrence Ranger The Invention\nof Tradition. By then, of course, the\nwriters had lived through the curious\nhybrid of nationalist pan-Africanism\nduring the end of official Imperialism\nin the 60s. That this seeming paradox\nwas possible was very suggestive for\n\u2018person to compete with\u2019 to \u2018women\nto compete with\u2019 is both the locus of\nsexism and irreducible to class rivalry.\nSimilarly, feminism was for a long time\na middle-class phenomenon; certainly,\nthe \u2018women\u2019 Mary Wollstonecraft\nspeaks of are unmistakably bourgeois\nwomen, though this has been largely\nremedied by the theorists from de\nBeauvoir on. Things were largely the\nsame elsewhere in Europe and in the\nUS though Howard Zinn does tell a\nrather touching story of a meeting\nbetween Eugene Debs and Susan\nAnthony. The relationship between\nMarxism and feminism has always\nbeen complicated, and will probably\ncontinue to be so.\n4) The Role of Class. Class\nis a surprisingly complex concept\nin Marx\u2019s work as Luk\u00e0c\u2019s History\nand Class Consciousness shows.\nThe formula oft repeated by vulgar\nMarxists and their more vulgar\ncritics that kicks of the analysis in the\nManifesto, \u2018The history of all hitherto\nexisting societies is the history of class\nstruggle\u2019, is I would suggest, by no\nmeans as determinist as many people\nsay, though there is not space to argue\nthis here. Much has been made,\nrecently, about the disappearance of\nclass, though if this is true it is a purely\nwestern phenomenon and there is\nmuch reason to doubt that this is true\neven in the west. There is a very sad\ntruth to Warren Buffets words, \u2018there\nis class warfare, and it is my class, the\nrich, that is winning.\u2019 Certainly with\ninternational inequality decreasing\nand overall inequality increasing talks\nof the end of class society seem a little\nprevious.\nOn the other hand, some recent\nanalyses have also led to a proliferation\nof new classes, the precariat, the\nconsumertariat etc. These discussions\nare basically idiotic, or even cynically\ndisposed along the lines of divide and\nconquer, but they contain a core of\ntruth which all the successful Marxist\nrevolutionaries (Mao, Lenin, Ho Chi\nMinh, Castro etc.,) picked up on.\nThe truth is, in brief, the declining\ndemographic role of the industrial\nproletariat and the persistent refusal\nof society to polarize itself into the\ntwo great camps as per the dictates of\nthe Manifesto.\nOn the whole recent left wing\ncritiques have not abandoned class\nanalysis,buttheyhavestoppedthinking\nin terms of proletariat/bourgeoisie\nand the new elect revolutionary class\nis the lumpenproletariat of old; Negri\nand Hardt\u2019s \u2018rhizomatic multitudes\u2019;\nthe billion new slum dwellers, the\nunemployed and those subsisting on\nthe informal economy \u2013 essentially the\ndemographic base of the progressives\nin Latin America. Goran Therborn\nhas written a perspicacious summary\nfor New Left Review. I direct those\ninterested there.\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\nthe nation as the basic unit of political\norganization. Similarly, in Marx\u2019s day,\nthere was probably little thought that\nthere could be any hostility between\nnational movements and socialist\nmovements; though Garibaldi was\na somewhat dubious socialist, the\nFenians were considered kosher and\nhad close links with Engels. It was\nreally only with WWI that there\nwas any conscious discussion of the\nantagonism between socialist and\nnationalist ends, though Benedict\nAnderson rightly points out that the\nWelsh miners did not feel unpatriotic\nnationalist phenomenon.\n3) The Role of Women.\nHere the issue is in many ways the\nother way round to the previous\npoints. While the Manifesto, because\nof Engels, had a really rather feminist\nposition for its day, Marxism has\ntraditionally been somewhat hostile\nto feminist movements. Women, of\ncourse, were a large \u2018standing army\u2019 of\nworkers to be exploited driving wages\ndown and so typical intra-class rivalry\nno doubt played a part in this hostility\nof the working classes to women,\nthough the transposition from\ntaringa.net\n\n"

    "content": "17\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 07 MAR\nBOOKS\nMaciej Matuszewski talks about the the groundbreaking debut\nscience fiction novel by Ann Leckie\nAncillary Justice, the debut novel of\nAnn Leckie, is one of those novels\nthat had been recommended to me by\npretty much everyone. However, as is\noften the case, my other commitments,\nand my impressively long reading list,\nmade me put off picking up for quite\na while. Now, having finally read it,\nI realise that I should have heeded\nmy friends\u2019 advice and checked it out\nsooner because Ancillary Justice is\ntruly one the best books that I have\nread in recent years.\nThe novel is set in the distant future,\nwith humanity having spread across\nthe stars \u2013 much of it ruled by the\nmilitaristic Radch Empire. Its leader,\nAnaander Mianaai, simultaneously\noccupies countless different bodies,\ngiving her near immortality and\nallowing her to micromanage all\nof the many different star systems\nshe controls. Mianaai exerts her\nwill through her massive fleet of\nAI controlled starships. The largest\nof these each house thousands of\nancillaries \u2013 bodies of former enemies\nof the empire who have had their\npersonalities erased and are now\ncontrolled by the ships\u2019 AIs and used\nas soldiers.\nOur protagonist is one of those\nancillaries, containing the last\nremnants of the now destroyed AI of\nthe ship The Justice of Toren. Taking\non the name Breq she vows to take\nrevenge on the person responsible\nfor her ship\u2019s destruction \u2013 Anaader\nMianaai herself.\nThis is a set up that presents many\ndifferent possibilities and Leckie\ncertainly doesn\u2019t disappoint. The\nplot is fast paced and well developed,\nwith exciting action and imaginative\nsettings. However, the wider themes\nthat the novel explores are its real\nstrength. We see how fear and self-interest perpetuates the brutality of\nthe Radch Empire, despite most of its\ncitizens being ordinary, reasonable\npeople. We see how an atmosphere\nof hopelessness and repression can\nmaintain a rigidly divided class system\nthat helps no one. And we see how a\n3,000 year old AI can develop into\nsomething far more human than\nanyone expected.\nIn the hands of a lesser writer, putting\nall these elements together would have\nresulted in a confused mess. Leckie,\nhowever, makes them all fit perfectly\ntogether \u2013 they all build on each other,\nand add to the central plot.\nThe focus of the novel is, of course,\nThe Justice of Toren herself. The\nstory is told in first person from her\nperspective, which really helps us to\nunderstand her. Over the course of\nthe book her character is slowly and\nsubtly developed as we learn how\nthe weight of thousands of years of\nexperience turned her from a simple\nfighting machine into someone far\nmore complex.\nAnother interesting aspect of the\nbook is that Radchaai society has no\nconcept of gender, and indeed many\ncitizens of the Empire find it difficult\nto recognise gender in other societies.\nThismeansthat,inTheJusticeofToren\u2019s\nfirst person narration, every character\nis referred to by feminine pronouns.\nFor most of the characters we never\nfind out if they are biologically male or\nfemale and for other, such as Anaader\nMianaai and her many bodies, we\nknow explicitly that such distinctions\nare meaningless. This is a fascinating\nand innovative technique that really\nmakes the reader question their\npreconceptions about gender roles and\nstereotypes.\nAll in all, this is a great book. I was\nhooked from the very first chapter and\nI sincerely recommend it to you all.\nAncillary Justice\nWORM IN APPLE\n\u201c... Ancillary Justice is truly one of\nthe best books that\nI have read in recent years.\u201d\n\u201c The plot is fast\npaced and well developed with exciting action and imaginative settings.\u201d\n\u201c... fascinating and\ninnovative, making\nthe reader reader\nquestion their preconceptions about\ngender roles and\nsterotypes.\u201d\n\n"

I never really\nthought much of it, until the film\nAbout Time when I decided this is\nsomething I should try at least once.\nSo, I decided to take my girlfriend\nout there on a date last month for\nwhat turned out to be a truly unique\nexperience.\nUnlike the well-lit areas of west\nLondon that we are all used to, EC1\nis not lit up just as well. Five minutes\nfrom the tube station, there lay a dimly\nlit restaurant off the main road. Once\nyou enter, you are told to put away\nmobile phones and any other object\nthat produces any form of light. A tab\nis opened up in your name and you\nare shown to the upstairs bar to have a\ndrink and choose your menu.\nThe menu consists of four options:\n\u2018Red\u2019 for meat, \u2018Blue\u2019 for fish, \u2018Green\u2019\nfor veggie and \u2018White\u2019 is the chef\u2019s\nsurprise. You don\u2019t really know what\nyou are about to eat and those are the\nonly choices you have. For the price of\n\u00a351 for a three-course meal it\u2019s pretty\nsteep, even by London standards. The\ntab opened for you at the start lulls\nyou into a false sense of security and\nit\u2019s easy to lose track of how much you\nare spending.\nAfter waiting a few more minutes,\nwe are informed that our table is ready\nand are shown downstairs and through\nsome heavy curtains to find a corridor.\nThe corridor is lit only by a couple of\ndim red lights. We, alongside another\ncouple are told to wait in line with\nour right arm on the shoulder of the\nperson in front. We met our waitress\nfor the night who would be guiding us\ninto the dining area and looking after\nus throughout the night. We went\nthrough a couple more sets of heavy\ncurtains and voil\u00e0! Pitch black. All I\ncould hear was the deafening sound of\nconversations and laughter that made\nme feel like I was in the middle of a\nbustling market.\nI stumbled across the darkness,\nmoving slowly and holding on to the\nwaitress for dear life until my hand\nwas placed on a chair. I was told this\nwas my seat and once I sat down, I\nrealised that I had lost my bearings\nand had no idea where the table was.\nSome shuffling followed before I\nrealised that I was facing the side of\nthe table and had been feeling up the\narm of the person sitting next to me.\nAs I turned towards my table, the first\nthing I realised was the strain on my\neyes as they got used to the darkness.\nI can\u2019t recall the last time I was in the\ndark like this. I put my hand in front\nof my face and I was unable to make\nout its shape \u2013 there was not a speck\nof light in the near vicinity.\nWith sight diminished, your other\nsenses are heightened. You are more\nin tune with the noise around you,\ntrying to make sense of it all. I tried\nto put a face to the voices I heard,\nbut it\u2019s very hard to tell much about a\nperson from just hearing them speak.\nThe atmosphere is also a lot friendlier\nthan usual. You find yourself easily\ninvolved in conversations around you\nas the barrier between strangers is\nsuddenly lifted. There is no way for\nyou to judge their reaction or read\ntheir body language, and you don\u2019t\nhave to behave in a certain way either.\nIt also paves the way for people being\nslightly more rude than usual, as the\nwoman sitting next to me cracked a\ncrude joke for the whole table.\nOnce the food arrived, eating was a\nlot more complicated than usual. At\ntimes, it\u2019s hard to find the food on the\nplate and you are often left wondering\nwhether you have finished your meal.\nSomeone from our table actually gave\nup cutlery and resorted to eating with\ntheir hands. Taste-wise, the meal was\nas good as any. A lot of guesswork is\ninvolved trying to figure out what\nexactly you are eating. I am told things\nsuch as vegetables often taste delicious\nif you don\u2019t know you are eating them;\nwhile the duck pieces I ate hardly\ntasted like duck. When we looked at\nthe menu after we had finished eating,\nthe only thing it seems I successfully\nguessed was the beef steak. But then\nagain, I thought I was having beef all\nthe way through.\nOnce we had finished eating and\nwere led out from the dark room, the\ndimly lit red corridor seemed so much\nbrighter than I remembered. I had to\nstay in the corridor for a good five\nminutes before I dared to venture into\nthe lounge. I have never appreciated\nthe power of sight more than that\nmoment.\nThe bill was slightly steep for the\nmeal, I must admit. However, it\nshould not be seen as just a meal in a\nrestaurant. It is more of an experience\n\u2013 much like theme parks. Once you\ntake that into account, and you know\nthat this is something to do once in\na while, things are not as bad as it\nseems. There are also information\npoints in the restaurant which seek to\nexplain the high cost. The company\ngets no subsidy from any government\nfor hiring the visually impaired and a\nsmall portion of the cost of your meal\ndanslenoir.com\ngoes to charity. Furthermore, they\nrequire a lot more staff than a normal\nrestaurant due to health and safety\nissues. It is great that they are able to\ngive the disabled jobs, and the unique\nexperience offered is certainly worth\nbeing a talking point for many.\nDans Le Noir. 30-31 Clerkenwell\nGreen EC1R 0DU. 020 7253 1100.\nhttp://london.danslenoir.com/ \u00a342 for\n2-course meal and \u00a351 for 3 courses.\nStudent discounts available.\nWell, okay, by that we meant\npancakes.

    "content": "62 FRIDAY 07 MAR\nSPORT Editor: Kunal Wagle\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial Eagles cruise to final of National Championships\nWith the ever growing interest in\nHandball across the country, the National University Handball Championships have become a rather large\nevent in recent years. This year saw the\nintroduction of regional qualification\nrounds for the first time in the history\nof the tournament. Stefan Bauer, who\nhas been representing Imperial at national and international tournaments\nsince 2007, was excited to be part of\nthe team once more. \u201cI remember the\nfirst Nationals we played. There were\nless than 10 men\u2019s teams entered in\nthe competition, but I knew the sport\nwould grow. Now there are over 60\nUniversity teams in the country and\nin London we have managed to set up\na LUS League. The sport has come a\nlong way.\u201d\nImperial men\u2019s finished 3rd in the\nlast two tournaments and are ranked\namongst the favourites again this\nyear. The women\u2019s team has joined\nforces with Kings College London and\nlooked to cause an upset in the early\nstages of the tournament.\nThe men\u2019s team received a rather ungrateful draw with three of the top\nfour teams from last year\u2019s event featured in the same qualification group.\nRoyal Holloway, who are the Eagles\u2019\nclosest rival in the league, were their\nfirst opponents in the opening game\nof the competition. Fully aware of the\nopponents\u2019 strengths and weaknesses,\nImperial controlled the north Londoners fierce left-handed back player\nand focussed on fast transitional play.\nTheir match plan worked beautifully\nand helped the Eagles to cruise to an\nopening 11:7 victory.\nMeanwhile, the women\u2019s team faced\narch rivals UCL on the other court,\nbut was outplayed by their swift ball\nmovement and great vision by the opponents\u2019 centre player. Southampton\nUniversity was a much more equal ad-versary, but despite leading for most\nof the game, Imperial were robbed\nof their victory by a last minute goal.\nMargherita Ciano, who was unable\nto attend the first day of fixtures was\npositive despite the 2 opening defeats.\n\u201cWe only have to win one game to\nmake it to the knock out game. If we\nmanage that, we can keep our hopes\nof qualification alive!\u201d.\nThe men\u2019s team continued their winning streak with a straight forward\nwin over Brunel 1st team. Lucas\nCarstens had to face his Super 8 team\nmate Oliver Barton, who played on\nthe right wing for the Uxbridge based\nteam, but the Eagles came out trumps\nonce more. \u201cBrunel is strong on the\nwing and on the line, but we were able\nto minimize passes to either of these\npositions. That forced turn-overs that\nwe converted in attack. This was a\ngreat team effort\u201d. Only an hour after\ntheir second game, the IC men had\nto face UCL and were given a chance\nto avenge the women\u2019s team. Recent\nencounters between those two sides\nhave had the potential to be very heat-ed, but the results were in favour of\nthe Eagles. This game was no exception and ended 12:7 after 20 minutes.\nSheng Hong Chai scored his first goal\nof the competition and was delighted with his first taste of University\nChampionship action. \u201cIt was a great\nday and I am happy to have my name\non the score sheet. Let\u2019s hope we can\nkeep going like this\u201d.\nThe second day of competition saw\nthe women face Brunel women\u2019s team.\nWith a much more confident display,\nthe Eagles ladies were leading for large\nparts of the game, but due to some\nrather questionable refereeing by an\nofficial who is also coaching Brunel,\nImperial were robbed of their deserved victory in the last minute of the\ngame. This meant that not even beating group leaders AECC would save\nthe ladies team, which had performed\nadmirably throughout.\nThe Men\u2019s team was set to face AECC\nin the early hours of Sunday morning in the repeat of the game for 3rd\nplace in last year\u2019s competition. The\nentirely Norwegian team from a European Chiropractic College won\nthe competition 3 years ago and has\nfielded strong teams on a yearly ba-sis. Neither squad had lost a game\nat that time and the clash lived up\nto the spectators high expectations.\nBoth teams were defending to an extremely high level and tried to keep\ntheir opponents out as much as they\ncould. In the dying minutes of the en-counter, a courageous wing shot from\nTigau Daniel-Horja ended the match\nat 2:2 after 20 minutes. Despite the\nlow score line, it was widely regarded\nas the toughest and most tense game\nof the weekend. Ruben Freytag was\nrather displeased with the result. \u201cWe\ndefended extremely well. Our analysis\nof their previous games was spot on\nand we managed to control them for\nlarge parts of the game. But we rarely\nmanaged to put pressure on them in\nthe second wave and from the wing\npositions; we were just too wasteful in\nattack.\u201d\nHaving dropped points in a Championship game for only the third time\nin 3 years, the Eagles were keen to put\nthings right against the Essex Blades\n(2nd in last year\u2019s competition) in\ntheir final group game. A win would\nguarantee top spot in the table and\nprogression to the final stages of the\ncompetition. The Blades, who, on\ntheir facebook page, threatened to\n\u201cdestroy heavily every other team\u201d, had\nto win to avoid a knock-out game. An\nexpectedly heated fixture ensued, but\nsome impressive displays by Stefan\nBauer in goal and Marios Papamichail\nas playmaker, \u2018destroyed heavily\u2019 the\nBlades from Essex and secured the top\nspot for the Imperial Eagles.\nClub President Rishi De-Kayne, who\nwas unable to attend the second day\nof the tournament due to romantic\ninvolvements, was very excited about\nthe team\u2019s success. His girlfriend later\nstated, that he asked her \u201cmake a baby\nand call it Eagle\u201d the same night.\nOverall, the weekend was a giant success for handball and should strengthen the bid for a new BUCS application.\nAs the only Olympic sport to not yet\nfeature in Britain\u2019s highest university\nsports competition, the pressure is\nhigh to produce events like these and\nshowcase the level and enthusiasm of\nthe sport and the clubs alike. The final\nis set to take place on the weekend of\nthe 8th/9th of March and the Imperial\nEagles Men\u2019s team will be hoping to\nimprove on their performances from\nlast year and finally bring the trophy\nto London.\nStefan Bauer\nIC Handball\nIC 1s thump UCL 5-1\nHeading into this match, IC were\ncomfortably in 2nd position, four\npoints ahead of our opponents, UCL\n1s. A win would secure 2nd place, and\nIC went to Shenley looking to exact a\nsweet revenge. Having beaten UCL in\nthe reverse BUCS home fixture 3-0 in\nthe first half of the season, we lost 0-1\nto them a few days later in LUSL due\nto a combination of an injury ravaged\nsquad and a lacklustre performance.\nThe warm up consisted mainly of\nImperial trying their best not to fall\nover. The pitches, although appearing smooth and nicely trimmed at\nfirst were, in fact, mostly waterlogged.\nEven Omar Amjad, on a brisk walk in\nhis world renowned first gear, would\nhave chopped up the grass to unplayable levels. In fact, Amjad apparently\ncouldn\u2019t even shift from neutral into\nfirst as he didn\u2019t even turn up to play\nthat day. Some crap about exams...\nFive minutes in, Paul Nugnet and Jim\nBeam Murphy combined well down\nthe left before The Nug (#FearTh-eNugnet \u2013 Linstead is the first official\nvictim) squared the ball to Crawford\nbefore he released Robinson into\nsome space with a through ball. After running into one of their centre\nbacks, he played a devilish back heel\nto Murphy behind him who smashed\na very well hit first time curler towards\ngoal. It curled so much in fact that the\nkeeper, originally diving to his left,\nhad to then outstretch his right hand\nthe other way to get a palm to the shot.\nIt was all in vain however, as the parry\njust rolled into the back of the net. 1-0\nwith five minutes played.\nAnother 15 minutes of IC domination followed, with the only consolation for UCL being how politely they\nwere relieved of possession time and\ntime again. In particular Private Lawson (Keane) and Andy Pavvvv (White\nViera) were doing well as holding\nmidfielders, mopping up the mess\nand distributing the ball forward well.\nHowever, what then happened was a\ndefensive implosion. A UCL ball over\nthe top released their winger, who put\nin a good cross to the back post. Their\nother winger arrived, hitting the ball\non the half volley and forcing a diving\nsave out of Casas Bofarull, which he\naccomplished for the 135th time without misplacing a single thread of hair.\nThe resulting spillage was lapped up\nby Jonty H 3 yards out who, possibly\na bit peeved at being played at centre\nback due to Amjad at home warming\nup the oil in his idle engine, decided\nto look up, eye up the top corner, and\nfind it without hesitation. Rumour\nhas it Kolo Toure, wherever he was\nat that exact moment, spontaneously\nburst into tears and was inconsolable.\nRumour also has it that Jonty in fact\ntried to clear the ball across the face of\ngoal but it instead ricocheted off Covers who was standing no more than\n1m away from him. However, from a\nview from the other side of the pitch,\nthe former is a more than adequate\ndescription of the events. 1-1.\nIC were not pleased with this setback\nat all, and proceeded to apply the afterburners and immediately put UCL on\nthe back foot again. Winger on a mis-sion, Cravin\u2019Dale was actually Cravin\u2019\nthe scalp of his opposition full back,\nInglourious Basterds style, and effortlessly relieved him of his head-top before squaring a low cross to Crawford\nwho found himself unmarked to fire a\nfirst time finish under the keeper. To\nreach the ball Crawford had quite possibly never run so fast in his life. When\nasked about this, he replied \u201cI thought\nI heard the bells of an after school Ice\nCream Truck. Sorry\u201d.\nThe first half finished 2-1, an uncomfortable score line for IC, and so Captain Robinson made the message clear\nat half time that at least two more\ngoals without reply were needed to be\nin any sort of comfort. Luckily, that\u2019s\nexactly what happened.\nThe second half began well as the game\nwas more open with UCL throwing\nmen forward in their vain attempt to\nactually score a goal with one of their\nown players. About 10 minutes in, Private Lawson decided to grab the game\nby the scruff of the neck. Sporting the\nfinest buzz cut Her Majesty\u2019s armed\nforces have ever seen (0-1-0), he de-livered. Having just returned from a\nheavily weighted march to Blackpool\nand back, the team were forced to\nlisten to his tales of the \u2018unparalleled\u2019\nand \u2018magnificent\u2019 Big Dipper. Teary\neyed and emotional from having the\nprivilege of seeing one of the Seven\nWonders of the World up close, he\nproduced his own Big Dipper. Controlling a ball on his battle-hardened\nknee he thrashed a volley over the\ndespairing keeper into the back of the\nnet from all of 35 yards. A 21 gun salute later and the game resumed.\nCravin\u2019Dale was still as thirsty for\nmilk as he has ever been (So good,\nDale wants it back. And he will get it\nback.), and continued to give his opposite man nightmares. I\u2019m not sure if\nyou readers are aware, but #TheThirst\nis indeed Real and Dale has been diagnosed terminally ill with it. He was\ninvolved more than twice in a slick,\none touch pass move down the right\ninvolving the dangerous triumvirate\nof Jim Beam Murphy, Ice Cream Man\nCrawford and Cravin\u2019Dale. Jim arrived\nperfectly late just inside the box, a la\nFat Frank, and finished with aplomb\nsmashing the ball into the left corner.\n4-1.\nUCL were now in bits and pieces and\nwere repeatedly sliced open on the\ncounter attack. Murphy drove forward through the middle from a defensive corner before releasing Robinson straight ahead of him on the half\nway line with a through ball which left\nthe centre back with no hope of catching him. Taking a couple of touches to\nsteady himself, Robinson then calmly\ncurled the ball round the keeper into\nthe bottom right corner while still\na good distance outside the box. 93\ngoals now for him in an Imperial shirt.\nWith a minimum of 3 games left, the\ncentury looks a challenge, but definitely not impossible. 5-1, with 6 goals\nscored by an IC player. The match was\nwell and truly over. Man of the Match\nwas Cravin\u2019Dale \u2013 #TheThirstIsSoRe-al in him that the award could never\nhave been given to any other man.\nThis convincing win not only cemented the team\u2019s 2nd place position in the\nleague, but also leaves them 2 points\nbehind the leaders Hertfordshire, who\nthey play the following week away in\nthe final match of their BUCS cam-paign. Beating them would then put\nIC at the top of the table, with the ball\nbeing in Hertfordshire\u2019s court to get a\nresult from a tricky away trip to Canterbury on the 19th March for the last\nmatch of the season.\nICUAFC is sponsored by:\nJack Robinson\nIC Football\n\n"

A lot\nhas changed at the Hawthorns since\nthen, and Pepe Mel is still searching\nfor his first win as Baggies boss. Now\nwould be a good time with the threat\nof relegation looming but he has come\nfrom behind to draw all four of his\nhome games 1-1 and with United as\nunpredictable as a bag of revels of late,\nthat\u2019s a result that would probably just\nabout satisfy both managers. 1-1\nCardiff vs. Fulham:\nWhat a colossal relegation six-pointer\nthis is. For what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t think\neither of these sides has the stomach\nfor the battle they face and expect\nboth to be playing Championship\nfootball next year. But whereas Felix\nMagath\u2019s Cottagers showed character in holding West Brom in their last\naway match, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s\nBluebirds were hapless at home a fortnight ago, losing 4-0 to Hull. Cardiff\ndo not look like beating anyone in\ntheir current form, so I think this is\nFulham\u2019s game to lose, and they have\nnot lost on the road since January. 0-1\nCrystal Palace vs. Southampton:\nThere will be a major conflict of interests and clash of styles at Selhurst Park\non Saturday. Tony Pulis\u2019s abrasive style\nof play suits the relegation scrap Palace find themselves in. Saints, mean-while, has nothing to play for but the\nchance to showcase the free-flowing\nfootball for which Mauricio Pochettino has made his name since taking\nover. Both sides are on form and I cannot pick a winner. 1-1\nNorwich vs. Stoke:\nNorwich\u2019s position seems to have\nscarcely ever changed since they returned to the top flight of English\nfootball two and a half years ago.\nThey have managed to survive every\nseason without ever looking in major\njeopardy, and are on course to do the\nsame this year. You might say the same\nfor Stoke, who have experienced mid-table mediocrity for five or six years\non the trot. As a result, I can see this\nbeing a dead rubber \u2013 the Potters seldom threaten on their travels and the\nCanaries struggle terribly for goals\nthemselves. 0-0\nChelsea vs. Tottenham (Saturday\n5:30pm, Sky Sports 1):\nWith the competition for a European\nfinish as fierce as ever, rather ironically Tim Sherwood could probably do\nwithout the distractions of the Europa\nLeague at the moment. One thing is\nfor sure \u2013 he absolutely has to win this\nif Spurs are to stand any chance of a\ntop four finish. But Jose Mourinho is\nthe master of getting a result in big\nmatches and the manner in which the\nBlues grinded out their last home victory over Everton epitomised his style.\nI expect a similar scoreline again here.\n1-0\nPolo\nNationals\n2014\nOlivia Szepietowski\nIC Polo Captain\nWhile the rest of the world was waking up to roses and chocolates on\nValentine\u2019s Day, the Imperial College\nPolo Team was making the journey up\nto Rugby to compete in this year\u2019s National Universities Arena Polo Championships. Tim Wright (2nd year\nmaths) and Olivia Szepietowski (3rd\nyear medicine) were joined by James\nFaulkner (1st year engineering) who\nstudies at Brunel University but trains\nwith Imperial.\nAs the ball was thrown in on our first\nmatch against Edinburgh we all had a\nhairy few seconds where our enthusiasm and the quick reactions of our\nponies nearly threw the entire team\noff! Luckily we all caught our balance\nand set about sending the ball towards\ngoal. With only six minutes per match\n(called a \u2018chukka\u2019) we had very little\ntime to get into the swing of it, it\u2019s a\nrace to get as many goals as possible\nwhilst committing as few fouls as pos-sible. Within the first two minutes,\nwe had a penalty in our favour when\nI was hitting the ball towards the goal\nand was slammed into the boards by\none of Edinburgh\u2019s ponies. Thankfully I managed to score a goal despite\nthis, so we suddenly had two goals to\nnone and Edinburgh was beginning to\nsweat. From that point our confidence\nwas soaring and we managed to score\nanother goal before the whistle blew,\ngiving us a 3-0 win over Edinburgh; a\ngreat start to the tournament!\nWe had a few hours to kill before our\nsecond chukka of the day (and polo\ntime is notoriously slower than normal time) so we headed to the only\nplace where the floor wasn\u2019t two\ninches below water: the bar. After a\nfew mulled wines, the team were feeling much warmer and extremely confident about our chances in the N2\ndivision this year, especially after Imperial won the trophy last year in the\ndivision above. 52 Universities were\ntaking part this year, some with multiple teams, so it was fantastic to meet\nso many polo enthusiasts and watch\nsome excellent matches.\nOur second chukka was against Portsmouth, a deceptively innocent looking\nteam whose true colours were soon\nshown when the ball was thrown in.\nThe first thing I felt was sharp elbows\nin my side trying to push me off my\npony and they didn\u2019t relent for the\nnext six minutes. Tim badly hurt his\nshoulder a minute in which caused\nproblems throughout the chukka,\nwhile James and his pony were arguing over speed and direction. That is\nto say that we were having problems!\nPortsmouth scored the first goal, putting pressure on our team to keep\nup. As we rushed to take the ball, we\nfouled the other team and so they\nwere rewarded a penalty shot at our\ngoal, which they scored. This upped\nthe ante so we responded by driving\nthe ball hard up the arena and scoring our first goal. Perhaps the elation\nmade us impetuous, because we went\non to commit another foul against\nPortsmouth and so handed them another goal, leaving the final score 3-1\nto them. Disappointed as we were, it\nwas a fantastically fast paced chukka\nthat we all enjoyed and found both\nchallenging and tiring, a good end to\nthe first day.\nThat evening we headed to a nearby\npub for dinner and had a romantic,\ncandlelit Valentine\u2019s dinner for three\nbefore retiring absolutely shattered.\nUnfortunately for James, his bed was a\nsleeping bag in the arena so when the\nfirst rider entered the arena at 8:30am\nthe next morning and saw him sleeping there they did what anyone in that\nposition would do: blow a klaxon in\nhis ear. So with that start to the morning we prepared for another day of\npolo.\nWith a few hours until our third chukka we went to support team GB playing against the USA and were blown\naway by the speed and agility of these\nyoung players. It was a hugely excit-ing, four chukka game, with a goal being scored every minute. It was tense\nat times, and the screams from the\ncrowd were deafening but sadly not\nenough to bring GB to victory, and\nthey suffered a 15-11 defeat.\nWith visions of the international\nteams in our heads, we headed into\nour first chukka of the day against the\nDefence Academy. Our tactics were\ngood and we worked fantastically as a\nteam but the match was tricky, especially with Tim injured. Elbows were\nback out and ride-offs were vicious,\nleading to a final score of 2-2. This lead\nto an exciting, sudden death, penalty\nshoot-out with the Defence Academy\nscoring their goal by a hairsbreadth.\nUnfortunately we missed our penalty\nshot so lost the chukka but agreed that\nit was another exhilarating match that\nwe thoroughly enjoyed. As we brought\nthe ponies back to the pony-lines I noticed my hand covered in blood and\nwas almost relieved that I had a minor\ninjury to show for the weekend, proof\nthat I played hard! After getting my\nthumb bandaged up, we had a team\ntalk over a few more mulled wines\nand prepared for our final match.\nTim went to play a match for Oxford\nBrooks who didn\u2019t have enough players and managed to fall off his pony\nbut not before shouting \u201cgetting off!\u201d\nWith three injuries in the bag now\nand us all relying on James\u2019 health we\nheaded into the arena with high spir-its, determined to enjoy (and survive)\nthe final chukka against Bristol. From\nthe moment the ball entered the line-up, we were in control and headed\nstraight up towards the goal, scoring\nimmediately. We threw our ponies\nround and galloped up to steal the ball\nfrom Bristol and send it back down to\ntheir end again: another goal. We were\non fantastic form, working brilliantly\nas a team and buoyed by the cheers\nand encouragement from our sup-porters. We ended our final chukka of\nNationals with a 3-0 win, placing us\n7th out of 16 universities (with Warwick taking 1st).\nThat evening we celebrated in style\nwith all of the other universities at a\nfancy dress party, consuming many\nbottles of champagne and even the\nodd champ\u00e4gerbomb (it\u2019s exactly what\nit sounds like, try it at your own risk!).\nWe partied until the early hours and\nweren\u2019t surprised on Sunday morning\nto see many players with dark sunglasses on and popping Berocca. As\nwe didn\u2019t have any matches on Sunday\nwe got to enjoy the brilliant sunshine\nand watch some spectacular polo with\nfriends, a perfect way to end such an\nexciting and challenging weekend.\nCongratulations Imperial Polo Team,\nnow for Summer Nationals!\nIC POLO\nIC POLO\nIC POLO\n\n"

    "content": "9\nFRIDAY 07 MAR\nCOMMENT\nYES\nColumnist\nNiall Jeffrey\nI\nt is ominously simple for people so\nfar from danger to forget the value of\ntheir own security. When the details\nof the recent joint US/UK surveillance\noperations emerged, our value assessment\nof the governments\u2019 work was skewed due to\nour privileged positions of safety.\nThe occupation of the NSA and GCHQ is\nsaving lives and preventing attacks on innocent people. It is possible, using information\nsearched for from Facebook and Twitter, for the\norganisations to automatically flag-up any potential threat before it happens.\nAny irregularity in typical online activity can\nbe the first indicators of future danger. Following up mobile-phone clusters in a distinguishing\nregion or newly created friend groups that do\nnot fit with the geography are all irreplaceable\ntools. Once a potential threat is discerned, more\ninformation can then be gathered. No other\nmethods of terrorism detection or prevention\nare effective on an international scale.\nThe fact that the NSA is able to automatically discover this information prevents serious\nbreaches of human rights by more aggressive\nmeans. The public hunger to hunt suspects directly in the wake of terrorist attacks, invariably\nleads to entities, like the CIA, forcefully following up unsubstantiated claims. A government\nagency preventing attacks and dealing with\nevents with the most amount of knowledge has\nthe greatest chance of not making mistakes.\nThe right to privacy itself is a goal that can\nonly be achieved by a person who has already\nsecured their right to life. Privacy is useless for\nthose who are not alive to benefit.\nWhen people weigh up the pros and cons of\ngovernment surveillance, they do not picture\nthemselves as the targets of potential terrorist attacks. The disconnect between media reporting of bombings or hijackings and our own\npersonal reality means people do not seriously\npicture themselves as future victims. The idea\nof our personal Facebook data being analysed\nfeels much more real than the surreal pictures\non television. So when people choose between\nprivacy and security they often think privacy is\nmore important.\nThis is selfish. Although very relatively fewer\npeople are victims of terrorist attacks than use\nFacebook, the harm to those victims of unpre-vented terrorist attacks are far greater.\nIt is true that you will probably not be a hurt\nby attacks directly or indirectly, but that does\nnot mean someone else won\u2019t be. When you\nsay that you want data to remain private, it is\nbecause you probably will never see the many\nbenefits that can be gained from good, reliable intelligence to the government. If you deny\nthe ability of security services to target potential threats, you are increasing the chance that\nsomeone, somewhere will lose their life.\nDebate: This House Values\nSecurity over Individual Privacy\nColumnist\nAnita Chandran\nNO\nW\nhen bodies such as the\nNSA are given unrestricted\naccess to personal data,\nthey are open to be being\nabused. Large numbers\nof people are allowed top level clearance\nto NSA data within the United States. It is\ndifficult, therefore, to keep control over this\ninformation. See Edward Snowden, a private\ncontractor whose clearance level allowed\nhim to access secret data. Although Edward\nSnowden\u2019s motives were not blackmail or use\nof information to destroy individuals within the\nstate, it is not possible to eliminate the idea that\nthis could happen in a system where security is\nvalued over an individual\u2019s privacy.\nFurthermore, governments themselves are in\na position to misuse information for their own\nends. That\u2019s not to say that states all abuse their\npower, but it\u2019s possible that individual governments use information to maintain their political advantage. Scandals such as Watergate (in\nwhich the Nixon administration committed\nwere involved in a plethora of illegal activities\nagainst his opposition to further themselves po-litically) are good examples of where this sort of\nmanipulation has occurred. This sort of abuse\nposes enormous harms to people living within\nthe state system. It opens them up to mistreatment that they are powerless to stop from the\nstate which is constructed to protect them.\nIt is highly unlikely that government manipulation of this nature does occur en masse. So,\nwhy is it important that we value individual privacy over national security? It is for a manner of\nreasons that are more likely, that produce different sorts of direct harms to individuals.\nTake the example of profiling in the search for\nthreats to national security. Mass electronic surveillance is often used to single out individuals\non an ethnic basis. For example, consider the not\ninsignificant number of \u2018suspected people\u2019 who\nare put on government no-fly lists for no apparent reason. These people are from a selection of\n\u2018danger groups.\u2019 This is a direct consequence of\nthe way in which automated surveillance works\n(i.e. by considering certain permutations of\ncharacteristics which would suggest a person\nis \u2018suspicious.\u2019) However, the harm posed to an\nindividual when they feel that the state is somehow aligned against them is significant. It is a\nhuge inconvenience to be practically restricted\nbut it is also a deeply distressing occurrence to\nbe vilified for your ethnicity.\nWhile it is true that some people are willing\nto accept the government surveillance, the potential harms of unrestricted prioritisation of\nsecurity prove detrimental to a large number of\npeople. Furthermore, the efficiency of such surveillance should be questioned. Terrorist links\nare nigh on impossible to spot with inefficient\nmass scanning of data.

    "content": "50 FRIDAY 07 MAR\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe sound of cringe\nThe Sound of\nMusic Live!\nJohn Park\nTelevision Editor\nThe Sound of Music is without doubt\none of the most beloved films of all\ntime whether you like it or not. There\nisn\u2019t a Christmas that goes by without\nJulie Andrews running on top of a hill\nsinging at the top of her lungs, making\nthe moody yet a-true-softie-at-heart\nChristopher Plummer fall in love with\nher, dressing the von Trapp children in\nthose hideous curtain clothes and together sneakily escaping the Nazis in\ntheir final moment of hurrah. And so\nit\u2019s understandable why there was so\nmuch social media hate and concern\nwhen American Idol winning country music star Carrie Underwood was\nchosen to play the lead, something the\nvon Trapps themselves were not too\nhappy about, instead suggesting Academy Award-winning Anne Hathaway\nfor the role.\nIs Underwood as dreadful as people thought she was going to be? Not\nquite. The good thing is she can sing,\nand yodel too. She of course does not\ncarry the finely tuned, piercing voice\nof Julie Andrews, but the more gutsy,\nforceful interpretation of the \u2018Good\nGirl\u2019 singer works just fine. It\u2019s only\nwhen she stops singing and has to act\nthat problems start to emerge. Her delivery of lines is so flat and monotonous that it often feels like the audience is being subjected to a primary\nschool amateur production of the\nmusical. She may have won Grammys,\nbut she will not be winning any acting\nOscars any time soon for sure.\nThe opposite is true for Stephen\nMoyer as Captain von Trapp. He can\nact, but he can\u2019t sing. Thankfully the\nnumber of times he\u2019s required to do\nthis is scarce compared to the times\nUnderwood has to speak, but the all-important \u2018Edelweiss\u2019 and the \u2018Something Good\u2019 duet lack a strong emotional punch because of this. Watch as\nMoyer struggles through his solo: his\ntoe-curlingly cringe-worthy interpretation of \u2018Edelweiss\u2019 is almost unbear-able, which goes to show the best has\ndefinitely not been saved for the last\nin this special one-off television event.\nThe love story between the two\ncharacters is of course a massive selling point, one that Julie Andrews and\nChristopher Plummer forever forged\nin their 1965 hit film, although nothing of the sort is remotely replicated\nhere. There is no heart, no chemistry,\nand no passion. The two leads appear\nas though this is a massive chore for\nthem, and granted, performing live\nfor so long cannot be easy, but there is\nsomething so mechanical and robotic\nabout their performances that no con-vincing, smooth potrayal is ever in\nsight throughout the three-hour running time (that thankfully takes into\naccount commercial breaks \u2013 the actual show runs for around two hours).\nThe wonky, dubious accent of Laura\nBenanti, as the posh Baroness Elsa\nSchrader so obviously trying to seduce her way into Captain von Trapp\u2019s\npants (clearly not thinking through\nthe seven children she\u2019ll have to inherit along with his estates) is at times,\nunintentionally hilarious.\nThe only performer who really\nstands out is the four-time Tony-winning Audra McDonald who can both\nsing and act (sadly a rare find in this\nremake event). Her belting, operatic\nrendition of \u2018Climb Every Mountain\u2019 is\npowerfully resonating to say the least\nand as a firm mother-figure to Maria,\nshe has a brief but crucial and memorable role, one that is filled by a much\naccomplished actress.\nThe young cast, which includes the\nseven von Trapp children, are there to\nlook sweet and harmonise well, which\nthey do, even though Rolf (Michael\nCampayno), the Nazi boyfriend of von\nTrapp\u2019s eldest, Liesl (Ariane Rinehart),\nis clearly not \u201c17 going on 18\u201d as he\nsings in possibly one of the most misogynistic songs of all time. The two of\nthem are also required to roll around\non some very limited-space outdoor\nset design that looks more dangerous\nthan romantic.\nDespite the surprising omission of\nthe song \u2018I have confidence\u2019, the musical numbers translate well, with simple but neat choreography to delight\nand put us all in a cheery mood. It\u2019s\na real tribute to the musical itself that\neven decades after the stage premiere,\nthere are songs that are still catchy and\nhummable, which goes to show the\nlove for The Sound of Music will not\nbe dying out no matter who does what\nto butcher the talky gaps in between\nthe music.\nBeing a live television production\nrather than a one-stage set perfor-mance, the show uses its freedom to\nmove around in between the different\nbackground sets built. Scene transitions are generally smooth, although\nthe incredibly plain-looking backdrops only further reflect the serious\nlimitations of the production quality.\nHaving been watched by over 18\nmillion people in the States upon its\ndebut in December 2013, NBC has\nsigned Craig Zadan and Neil Meron,\nthe two creators responsible for this\ntacky rehash, to produce even more\nlive television presentations stage\nshows. Please, please, please leave\nsome of the greats alone. Nothing to\ndo with The Phantom or Les Mis. Having feature films is good enough.\n\n"

    "content": "6 FRIDAY 07 MAR\nWELLBEING Editor: Marissa Lewis\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nhere\u2019s been a movement in\nthe last couple of years to\nget people talking about\ntheir experiences with\nmental health, whether it\u2019s\non a national scale such as Mind\u2019s\nTime to Talk campaign or Imperial\u2019s\nown OpenMinds campaign. There\u2019s\nalso been a move to try and explain\nlife with a mental illness to others who\nhaven\u2019t suffered one, a daunting task\nat best, but a project which has yielded\nreally amazing work. My personal\nfavourite is Hyperbole and a Half\u2019s\nweb-comic \u2018Adventures in Depression\u2019\n(shown below) because it rings most\ntrue to my experiences of depression\nalthough, of course, everyone\u2019s\nexperiences are different. It also\ncontains the use of stick men, which is\na well-known Union favourite.\nWhat isn\u2019t discussed as much, or at\nleast what I haven\u2019t picked up on, is\nwhat happens after you recover. I\u2019ll\nuse the term \u2018recover\u2019 quite loosely\nhere because it means different things\nto different people \u2013 for many, it isn\u2019t\na matter of curing a mental illness and\nbeing magically better, but more like\nfinding a treatment program which\nworks and that leads someone to feel\nlike they have control over their life\nagain. For me, I had several years of\nreally quite debilitating depression\nwhen I was younger and now I don\u2019t.\nI\u2019m not currently receiving treatment\nfor any mental health condition either.\nI face a real temptation to simply\nclose the book on that relatively long\nand painful aspect of my life. Talking\nabout mental illness isn\u2019t easy and\nwhen you pass as a neurotypical\nperson 99% of the time, you pick up\non thoughtless comments from others\nwho assume you\u2019re in on the joke.\nThis year, I heard people say that they\nwouldn\u2019t want a sabbatical officer\nwho\u2019d had mental health problems\nand, as a medical student, sometimes\nthe opinions of my course-mates can\nbe rather jarring. The idea of a doctor\nwith mental health issues can be met\nwith scorn, as a diagnosis is often\nequated to irrationality and instability,\nwhereas patients with mental health\nproblems can be seen as time wasters.\nConversely, you can also find yourself\nexcluded from discussions with fellow\nsufferers as you are assumed to be\nignorant to these issues.\nThere are benefits to staying\nsilent about mental illness and I\u2019d\nbe disingenuous to pretend there\naren\u2019t; you don\u2019t have to deal with the\nassociated stigma quite so harshly\nand you don\u2019t have to worry about\npeople treating you differently.\nWhat I\u2019ve found difficult this year is\nthe increased scrutiny you get as a\nsabbatical, namely the odd Tab article\nas well as your image on video screens\nall over the Union, which amplifies\nyour normal human desire to present\nan infallible image to the world by the\nfactor of fifty. I often tried to find some\nsort of middle ground between saying\nnothing and full disclosure, couching\nmy illness as \u2018poor mental health\u2019 or\nother euphemisms rather than being\nexplicit \u2013 in doing so I found myself in\nthe strange situation of being anxious\nto disclose even that much and feeling\nlike I\u2019d copped out of saying anything\nmeaningful.\nI also feel a bit ridiculous talking\nabout something that happened\nyears ago and that I was fortunate\nenough to get through. I grew up\nwith a parent with very severe mental\nhealth issues, including delusions and\nhallucinations, which led to them\nfalling in and out of hospital, often\nunder involuntary sections. For a\nlong time, I was trying to battle the\nperception I had that unless your\nillness called for sirens and hospitals, it\nwasn\u2019t really worth burdening anyone\nwith. At the time, I managed to trick\nmyself into thinking my condition\nwasn\u2019t really that serious as I was still\nsitting exams and getting good marks,\ndespite not attending around half of\nmy classes in sixth form. I now realise\nthat was absurd.\nWhen you\u2019re mentally ill, your\nperceptions often change in ways you\ndon\u2019t realise and even now, several\nyears free of depression, I\u2019m still\nrealising how messed up some of my\nold, lingering thought patterns were.\nMy view of recovery at that time\nwas particularly wrong. When I was\nsick, I either envisioned recovery as\nsome glorious light at the end of a\nhideous tunnel that I\u2019d never reach\nor I\u2019d see it as equally bleak as my\ncurrent situation. The reality was\nsomewhat different and I think it\ngoes something like this: life can suck\nsometimes, whether or not you have\na mental illness, and life also doesn\u2019t\ncare if you\u2019ve had a mental illness in\nthe past and could really use a break,\nthank you very much. What changes is\nyourself \u2013 the issues that would have\nknocked me sideways a few years ago,\nwhich ranged from major events to\ngetting out of bed in the morning, I\ncan now handle. And although some\ndays are rubbish, I\u2019m aware that the\nbad times are finite and I will feel\nhappiness again. Sounds simple, but I\nwould have scoffed at these concepts\nin the past.\nI also know how tempting it is to\ncling on to anything that offers you\na chance of recovery when you\u2019re\nill, whether or not this is rational,\nbe it a friend or family member or a\ntreatment program or risk-taking\nbehaviours that give you the illusion\nof feeling something else for even the\nbriefest period of time. For me, I didn\u2019t\ndo well in any sort of formal treatment.\nI had counselling for a while but ended\nup just telling the counsellor what I\nthought she wanted to hear. After I\nwas diagnosed when I was sixteen,\nI was referred to a psychiatrist to\nstart drug therapy and CBT but that\njust freaked me out and it didn\u2019t take\nme long to drop out. Instead, I was\nfortunate to have amazing friends\nwho put up with me for several long,\ndifficult years (no small feat given they\nwere just teenagers themselves) and\nI was fortunate to come to Imperial\nwhen things were at their worst - a\ndrastic change of scenery was probably\nwhat I needed most of all. For the vast\nmajority of the population, that isn\u2019t\nvery feasible.\nPeople often feel a lot of anxiety\ndisclosing a mental illness whether\ninformally to friends or formally to\ntheir departments in College. As\nDeputy President (Welfare), it\u2019s hard\nadvocating people to do things that\nI\u2019ve personally found terrifying in\nthe past and this article is one of\nmany steps I\u2019m taking to rectify that.\nRecently, I\u2019ve joined up with the\nCounselling Service, Union Advice\nCentre and Disability Advisory Service\nto go around different departments in\norder to talk to students about mental\nhealth. One of the things I say in my\ntalk is that although, in your head, you\nimagine people freaking out if you tell\nthem you are having problems with\nyour mental health, the most common\nreaction I\u2019ve had to disclosure is\npeople start disclosing themselves. I\nsuppose I\u2019m living proof as this article\nwas prompted by a candidate for\nDisabilities Officer disclosing their\nown struggles with mental health on\ntheir public manifesto \u2013 for me the\nmost compelling moment of the Big\nElections so far.\nStill, I want to end this article with\nsomething positive and so I\u2019ll talk\nabout the moment that I realised I\nwas getting well. I went to stay with a\nfriend of mine (pictured above) who\nlives out in the middle of nowhere \u2013\nher village doesn\u2019t even have a post\noffice and only recently got a pub. We\ndrove out to one of the fields around\nher house and it was a late afternoon,\nso the sun was just beginning to set,\nand we had the car radio blaring as\nwe drove around in the open, not\nanother person in sight. It\u2019s irrational\nbut when you\u2019re depressed the main\nproblem is that you don\u2019t see a way\nout and you lose hope of ever feeling\nanything again. For one moment,\ndriving like an idiot and listening to\ncanned pop songs in the middle of\nsummer, I finally saw my life changing\nfor the better.\nI would like to share some massive\nmoment of revelation that would\nbe befitting of the end of a film, like\nstaring out over the Grand Canyon for\nthe first time (which I did some years\nlater with the same friend), but no,\nmy grand realisation occurred in the\ndriving seat of a Ford Focus.\nIt was probably equally amazing.\nMarissa Lewis\nWellbeing Editor\nHyperbole and a Half tries to show how even well-intentioned offers of help can\nfeel to someone with depression\nRecovering from depression\nMyself (centre), my friend (right of centre) and some travelling companions at the\nGrand Canyon, showcasing my variable hair styles.\n\n"

Improve RSM as a whole, focusing on\nimproving Material participation and influence\nwithin the RSM, bringing the two departments closer\ntogether; helping us to improve and share in our\nsuccesses.\nBroadening our use of social media to engage students,\nand increasing other opportunities for student\ncommunication.\nIncreasing communication and co-operation between\nall departmental societies to help each other, share\nideas and improving their respective abilities to\norganise events and increase student enthusiasm and\nparticipation.\nGreater cross-departmental events; to appreciate each\ndepartment and the aspects which link us together.\n(Materials main floor need bigger lockers similar to\nESE common-room)\n2. Lay the ground work for a long term strategy\nto broaden the RSM\u2019s influence and importance\nwithin Imperial; ensuring that presidents after me will\nnot have large battles to put us pride of place within\nImperial.\nFor greater importance on the bottle match, getting\neveryone at Imperial excited for it: long term goal of\neventually making it as important as the varsity match.\nShort term: Increasing our ties with media societies,\ne.g. Radio, STOIC and FELIX, we can present who we\nare and why people should care, to a much broader\naudience.\nMuch like Team GB\u2019s bid for the gold medal in the\nCurling Final at the Winter Olympics my candidacy\nfor RSMU President is dynamic, exhilarating and has\nwomen weak at the knees. In line with the concept\nwithin Curling; \u2018the harder you stroke, the further it\ngoes\u2019, I believe in going that extra mile, regardless of\nhow much stroking that needs to be done.\nI want to give something back to a close-knit family\nthat has given many memorable experiences during\nmy time at university. My involvement within the RSM\nhas ranged from my role on the Committee as the PITLicity Officer and within the Rugby team\u2019s efforts of\nretaining the Bottle this year in Camborne.\nA vote for me will mean:\n-Better funded social events\n- My experiences within school and university have\nallowed me to establish relationships with companies\nwilling to support the RSM. This will allow us to host\nevents with bar tabs at a variety of venues\n-Improved relationships between the student and the\nemployer\n- Securing summer internships has always been an\nissue for undergraduates and I want to work with\nthe teaching staff in devising new ways of making\nthis more accessible -Introducing relationships with\ncharities\n- The RSM lacks any association to local charities,\nand I want to introduce events where not only we as\na union can have good time but also give something\nback to the community.\nSo as the Dalai Lama once said \u2018You\u2019ve got the love to\nsee me through..\nVote Aneesh!\nRSMU President\nAlexander\nMytenka\nAneesh\nMisra\nBenjamin\nWarnick\nRSMU\nPresident\nI've spent my second year as a Royal Miner aboard three\nof the RSM committees. As RSM Hockey President,\nMen's Hockey Captain and DLB treasurer I have learnt\na huge amount about the inner workings of both the\nRSMU and the ICU. As a part of my hockey role I\nmanaged to secure tour funding by presenting in front\nof the CSPB which has given me a good insight into\nhow the union at large is run. Furthermore, as DLB\ntreasurer I have been actively involved in every step of\norganising trips, talks and social events.\nAs President I will aim to improve participation in\nthe union by encouraging the DepSocs and sports\nteams to put on more events early in the term as this is\nwhere long lasting bonds within the RSM are formed\nand where from my experience both hockey and DLB\nhave had the most success in getting fresher's involved.\nFurthermore I will strengthen bonds with the union\nto ensure that traditional RSM events such as Fresher's\nDinner are safeguarded and to maintain the high\nstandards of events and participation throughout the\nyear; with emphasis on the fantastic clubs, sports teams\nand societies that the RSM offers us. In short I will\ncontinue to uphold the traditions that make the RSM\nsuch a wonderful and unique place to study whilst still\nupdating and streamlining the way it is run.\nVote Ben! x\n\n"

The team has experienced both highs and lows throughout\nthe season, however the team has really\ncome together in recent weeks and will\nbe going into Varsity with a rich vein of\nform. With some massive games coming in the run up to Varsity our preparation could not be better. The team is\nshowing their desire to really compete\nat all levels and this is why I am sure\nthe medics will record a big win come\nMarch 12th. A superb striking force, a\nmaster class in midfield, a dogged defence and a gallant goalkeeper is what\nmakes the Imperial Medics 2s FC a\ngreat unit and with a great captain leading the team, come varsity it won\u2019t be a\nmatter of if we will win, but more the\nmatter of by how much we will win!\nThe main priority for the team this\nyear was to secure survival in the new\nBUCS league which we have just been\npromoted into. We have surpassed this,\nand are sitting comfortably in 2nd position behind a very good Hertfordshire\n1s team, with two matches to go. Our\nLUSL campaign has had a few hiccups,\nbut began very well by thoroughly beating our Varsity opponents, the Medics,\n5-0. Facing them again at the end of the\nseason is something we have all been\ngreatly looking forward to, and there\nis no doubt in my mind that we will be\nup for it and all over them from the first\nwhistle. Our prolific front three of Alex\n\u2018Cravin\u2019Dale\u2019 Dale (10 goals, 8 assists),\nJames \u2018Jimmy\u2019 Murphy (14 goals, and\nhis goal mountain of 16 assists), and\nmyself (20 goals, 7 assists) smell blood.\nJACK ROBINSON\n1ST Team Captain\nMARKOS REISSIS\n2ND Team Captain\n2013/14 has been a season of transition for us, with the loss of several first\nteam players to injury and the stresses\nof final year meaning we have found it\ndifficult to adapt to a higher level after\nBUCS and LUSL promotion last sea-son. However, despite this and a difficult run of fixtures before Christmas,\nwe are currently five games unbeaten\nand are still in contention for survival\nin both leagues coming into the run-in.\nWe also have high hopes of success in\nUH and NAMS cup competition. Going into Varsity, we can\u2019t ignore the fact\nthat we suffered the ignominy of a 5-0\ndefeat to IC 1s earlier in the season, but\nthis will only serve as added motivation\nto gain revenge when it really counts on\nWednesday 12th.\nA stellar season for ICUAFC 2nd XI has\nled to a title charge in BUCS and a solid,\ntop half of the table performance in a\ndebut season in the LUSL premier di-vision. Highlights of the season include\na goal from the halfway line, a 6 game\nwin-streak and an anthem of Scatman\nthat will stay with the squad for the rest\nof their days. Lowlights involve jam jars,\nspinal injuries and having to listen to\nthe perpetual moaning of IC\u2019s veteran\nstriker. After trouncing IC Medic 1s 5-1\non their own patch, who knows what is\nin store for IC Medic 2s at Fortress H?\nOne thing is for sure; they don\u2019t want it\nhalf as much as we do.\nJACK HEALY\n1ST Team Captain\nDANIEL MOXHAM\n2ND Team Captain\nThe ICUAFC 3s have gone from\nstrength to strength this season, an impressive feat given that we are coming\noff the back of promotion in both BUCS\nand LUSL leagues. We have seen strong\nadditions from within the club and from\nthe new wave of freshers, including\nFaidon Mitzalis, international man of\nmystery and Francis \u2018SBU\u2019 Nwobu. The\nbusiness end of the season is set to be\nan exciting one; we currently lie 1st in\nBUCS and are well in contention for a\nLUSL promotion.\nVarsity will be the 3s\u2019 only fixture versus any ICSM team this season. Having\ninitially played for the medics myself in\nfirst year, victory will be all the sweeter\nwhen it comes.\nThe seasons been completely different for the 3s in our two leagues. On\nWednesdays the results haven\u2019t been\nas good as we would have liked, but\nwe\u2019ve been fighting back in the past\nfew weeks, we\u2019re looking to finish in the\ntop third of the table. On Saturdays we\nhave had a lot of success, we\u2019re currently sat at the top of our league and are\nlooking for some silverware.\nAt Varsity we\u2019ll be looking to put last\nyear\u2019s loss firmly behind us, and are\nlooking forward to a great day.

He does not count among\nthese credentials the BAFTA that the\nsecond series of Comedy Vehicle won\nin 2010 for Best Comedy Program(3)\n.\nThis is perhaps unsurprising,\ngiven that in previous series he has\ndenounced television as \u201cthe idiots\u2019\nlantern\u201d, and Channel 4 as \u201clike a flood\nof sewage that comes unbidden into\nyour home\u201d. He has not, he assures us,\nseen Breaking Bad.\n\u201cI am culture,\u201d and yet here he is,\nsnarling at us through our idiots\u2019 lanterns once again. This tension between\nhis apparent high culture pretensions\nand his low culture medium(4)\nis one of\nLee\u2019s favourite subjects, even when he\nis not addressing it directly. His books\nconsist of transcripts of his stand-up\nsets, carefully introduced and con-textualised, and densely, ironically\nannotated(5)\nas if they were serious\nliterature. It\u2019s a theme that American\ncomedians have been quick to pick up\non, though none are as thoughtful or\nfunny as Stewart Lee(6)\n.\nTo this end, the first episode, which\naired last Saturday, was about \u201cpornography, and the human imagina-tion, and the internet, and all these\nsorts of things.\u201d(7)\nLee doesn\u2019t take\nlong to start wheeling out his usual\ntics. There\u2019s a pre-prepared note,\nimaginary phone conversations with\nhis hand, claims that he doesn\u2019t really\nknow what he\u2019s doing, pausing to allow the audience to guess a punch line\nbefore he delivers it anyway, thematic\nconsistency unusual for a stand-up\nshow, and insistent repetitions (\u201cI am\nculture,\u201d declares Stewart Lee). There\nare hints that his idiosyncratic style\nmight finally be becoming wearing(8)\n,\ndrained of its power to shock, but this\nfirst episode is among the most accessible 30 minutes of stand-up he\u2019s\ndone and these tics are still new for a\nnew audience. Somewhat brilliantly,\nmatching form with content \u2013 imagination \u2013 Lee closes with a routine\nwhich requires us to imagine a second\nvoice he\u2019s talking to on the phone, before fading away and inviting us to imagine Lee\u2019s closing lines as well.\nLee\u2019s other obsession is the status of\nthe stand-up comedian. For Lee, the\nrole of a good comic (or court jester)\nis to remind the establishment how\nridiculous it is. How can a comic do\nthis effectively if they are not themselves a low-status figure?(9)\nStewart\nLee has now won a BAFTA, made\ndocumentaries for Radio 4, writes for\nThe Sunday Times and The Guardian,\nhad books published by Faber and\nFaber (\u201cnot Tesco\u2019s own brand\u201d), cowritten and directed an award-win-ning opera, and curated jazz festivals,\nand performed John Cage pieces to\npaying audiences(10)\n. He\u2019s no longer a\nlow-status figure. He attempts to cut\nhimself down, and justify his ranting,\nby beginning the series with the claim\nthat Lee Mack has attacked him as \u201ca\ncultural bully from the Oxbridge mafia,\u201d and supposedly he is merely responding to defend himself. On top of\nthis, the show is cut throughout with\nclaustrophobic shots of Chris Morris\n(The Day Today, Brass Eye) interrogating and antagonising Lee, who is\nvisibly a broken man. Lee is in turn \u201ca\ncharlatan\u201d, \u201c[like] the devil\u201d, \u201clike a mad\nold pope\u201d(11)\n. For now, he continues to\njust about get away with it.\n\u201cI am culture,\u201d declares a delusional\nand ranting Stewart Lee in the final\nepisode of the new series of Comedy\nVehicle. He\u2019s probably not. He is funny though. It seems apt to paraphrase\nLee\u2019s friend Simon Munnery. You can\nwatch everything else on television\nand dismiss it as nonsense if you like.\nYou can dismiss it as nonsense without watching it to save time if you pre-fer. And that\u2019s the route I\u2019ve chosen.(12)\n(Saturdays at 10 pm on BBC 2 until\n5th April)\nFootnotes\n(1)\nA publisher he shares with Samuel\nBeckett, Ted Hughes, T.S. Eliot, Sylvia\nPlath, Seamus Heaney, William Golding, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and\nW.H. Auden, among others.\n(2)\nFor which some eccentric religious fundamentalists demanded he\nshould be tried for blasphemy.\n(3)\nIncidentally he might also have\nmentioned documentaries made\nfor Radio 4, and his writing for The\nGuardian and The Sunday Times.\n(4)\nA medium he shares with Bernard Manning, Jim Davidson, Frankie\nBoyle, and historical court jesters.\n(5)\nIt looks a bit like this.\n(6)\nBo Burnham captures it wonderfully in his song Art is Dead: \u201cHave\nyou ever been to a birthday party for\nchildren, and one of the children won\u2019t\nstop screaming? [\u2026] I am an artist.\nPlease don\u2019t revere me\u2026 I am an art-ist. You\u2019re free to correct me\u2026 I\u2019m just\na kid.\u201d\n(7)\nLee\u2019s words.\n(8)\nThis might be the point. At any\nrate, I suspect Lee would approve of\nthis response, insistent that continued\nrepetition will make it funny again\nlater.\n(9)\nFor Lee, the chief crime of Frankie\nBoyle and Jimmy Carr is not that they\nare offensive, but that they are bullies:\nhigh-status figures applying pressure\ndownwards.\n(10)\nThis repetition is more like Homer than Stewart Lee, really. I\u2019m trying\nmy best.\n(11)\nPresumably Lee\u2019s rejection of the\ninternet is like a medieval pope\u2019s rejection of mass-printed bibles in common languages.\n(12)\nStewart Lee also used a version\nof this joke, dismissing Russell Brand\u2019s\nbook, in the first ever episode of Comedy Vehicle. Munnery is dismissing\nthe Bible, with the context that he\u2019s on\nstage as a character, and the character\nis clearly insane. He walks on stage\nin a red jumper apparently covered\nin roses and opens with the immortal words, \u201cGood evening. I am the\nChurch of England.\u201d\nFew people could have escaped the\npopularity of the Netflix political drama series House of Cards. However,\nthe US show is actually a remake of\na 1990s British TV miniseries of the\nsame name. While I have heard wonderful things about the remake I have\nalways had somewhat of a fondness\nfor British television and have always\nfound the UK political system more\ninteresting than its American counter-part. Therefore, it should be of no surprise that I decided to devote the little\ntime that I had between lectures and\nproject work to watching the original\n(though its length \u2013 just four hours\nin total compared to the remake\u2019s\nthirteen hour long first season \u2013 was\nprobably also a contributory factor).\nI must say that I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\nSet in a fictionalised version of the\naftermath of the resignation of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister, the\nshow follows Francis Urquhart, the\nChief Whip of the Conservative Party\n\u2013 responsible for maintaining discipline on the back benches. After helping his colleague Henry Collingridge\nbecome leader of the Conservatives\nand win the subsequent general elec-tion, he expects a reward in the form\nof a senior Secretary of State position.\nHowever, when Collingridge reneges\non his promise and decides to leave his\nCabinet unchanged Urquhart vows revenge and begins scheming to become\nPrime Minister himself. This sets off\na tense and densely plotted story as\nUrquhart uses every dirty treat in the\nbook to unseat his opponent.\nThe focus of House of Cards is, of\ncourse, Urquhart himself. He is fiercely intelligent and absolutely ruthless.\nMuch of the fun of the show comes\nfrom seeing how he manages to skilfully and subtly manipulate all of his\nopponents into doing exactly what he\nwants. His genius comes from doing\nalmost everything indirectly, from the\nshadows, never admitting to anything.\nHis approach to politics is perfectly\nsummarised by his oft used line: \u201cYou\nmight think so, I couldn\u2019t possibly\ncomment\u201d. He appears to be so charismatic and earnest, thanks in large\npart due to a stunning performance by\nShakespearean actor Ian Richardson,\nthat even his greatest enemies believe\nhim to be their best friend.\nUrquhart is also a great character\non a more personal level. At the start\nhe appears to be an ordinary, if ambi-tious, upper class man. However, as\nthe show progresses we find out that\nhe has a darker core \u2013 he is utterly\nself-centred and doesn\u2019t care about\nanyone who gets into his way. However, he never becomes an outright\nvillain. He is always a well-rounded\nand nuanced character. Through the\nwriting, acting and the unusual technique of Urquhart often performing\nasides to camera, we get a picture of\nhim as real life, three-dimensional human being.\nThis is an intelligent drama that\nworks on many levels. It has a tense\nplot and is effective as both a political thriller and an in-depth character\nstudy \u2013 certainly something worth devoting four hours of your life to.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nContributor\nHipster House of Cards you won\u2019t find on Netflix\n\n"

A rule to which Melancholia is\nno exception. This time, the world is\nending, and not in the metaphorical\nway. Life on Earth will actually come\nto an abrupt finish. There is a large\nplanetary body called Melancholia.\nWhat was suspected to pass harmlessly is now on a head-on collision\ncourse, and there is nothing anyone\ncan do to stop that. But the planet itself serves no further purpose than for\nvon Trier to subject his female characters through some tough ordeals. This\nthe director staying true to his style\nand trademark, whilst incorporating a\nnew theme.\nOf course, most characters are not\ninitially aware of this mysterious foreign planet that will mark the end of\ntheir lives. We look at the complex\nlives of two sisters, Justine (Dunst)\nand Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg).\nJustine, the younger of the two, has\njust gotten married to a charming,\ndedicated man (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd),\nalthough she does not seem to be over\nthe moon about her nuptials. She appears to be a victim of depression, and\nher highly unpredictable, repressed\nbehaviour that struggles to sustain her\nmarriage and even herself threatens to\nruin her existence. After a lengthy, intense slow-motion opening in which\nthe thunderous soundtrack from\nWagner\u2019s Tristan and Isolde signals\nthe world\u2019s end, and the audience gets\na glimpse of \u2018The End\u2019, we focus back\nto Justine, heading up to her sister\u2019s\nlavish countryside mansion for her\nafter-party, in which many wedding\ntraditions are supposed to be carried\nout (the first dance, the cutting of the\ncake, etc.). But looking so distant and\nvulnerable, we worry whether she will\nmake it through the night.\nNothelping,areherbitterlydivorced\nparents, who have reluctantly united\nunder one roof for the sake of their\ndaughter\u2019s wedding. But of course, not\neverything goes smoothly. Their fierce\nand possibly a little drunk mother\n(the unforgettably sharp and piercing\nCharlotte Rampling) openly lashes out\nat her ex-husband who is proudly accompanied by a younger lover, and is\nAWOL during most of the party. She\nis highly uncooperative, and we begin\nto wonder why she came to this in the\nfirst place. This tense, uncomfortable\natmosphere is not what Claire\u2019s filthy\nrich husband John (Kiefer Sutherland)\nwanted, who incidentally paid for everything himself.\nThe stress becomes unbearable for\nthe already damaged Justine, and after\nthe disaster that is her wedding recep-tion, she suffers a breakdown. And this\nis one of many aspects in which Dunst\nexcels in her mature, sincere perfor-mance. She doesn\u2019t have an emotional\nfreak-out, but instead slowly descends\ninto a state of complete hollow mental\nstate in which she cannot bring herself\nto do or care for anything. Her performance is a wonderfully measured\nand grounded one, firmly holding on\nto the film\u2019s emotional core. Dunst\nreportedly used her own experience\nfrom depression as a source for playing her character. Well it works, and\nit works brilliantly. Distancing herself\nfrom everyone, including her husband\nand her sister, she is constantly in a\nblank, self-destructive state, and everything becomes meaningless to the\nheroine.\nHowever there is one thing that\nJustine becomes fascinated by: the\nincoming planet. Convinced that the\nEarth they are currently living on is\n\u2018evil\u2019, Justine welcomes the planet, and\nis not afraid of the inevitable conse-quence. Claire, who has a lot more\nto lose, acts differently. As the seemingly calm and collected one taking\ncare of her younger sibling in the first\nhalf, she becomes paranoid whenever\nthe planet becomes larger in her eyes.\nDespite her idealistic and optimistic\nhusband\u2019s assurance that Melancholia\nwill cause no harm, Claire\u2019s mind also\nstarts to wobble, at the thought of losing everyone she loves, including her\ninnocent young son.\nClaire and Justine don\u2019t share the\neasiest of relationships and this is\nshown clearly through yet another\nexcellent female performance in this\nfilm. Gainsbourg, although showing\nwarmth towards her sister, also lets\nout some cold air towards her, letting\nher frustration and annoyance seep\nthrough in her steadfast treatment\nof Justine. Hers is also an impeccably\nlayered and detailed performance,\none that beautifully matches Dunst\u2019s.\nGainsbourg has worked with von Trier before in the much more graphic\nand unsubtle Antichrist, in which she\nplayed a mentally unstable, ultimately\nviolent protagonist. Here she is much\nquieter and restrained, although not\nwithout the usual intensity the talented actress can portray on screen.\nShe cannot stop obsessing over Melancholia\u2019s size and the proximity of\nthe planet to Earth, and towards the\nsecond half it\u2019s Justine, the younger,\nseemingly more damaged sibling, having to stand firm whilst her older sister turns into a blubbering mess.\nVon Trier has that exceptional skill\nof turning the most unlikely subject into extraordinarily beautiful art\nform. Some perceive this as pretentious offering, but what he manages\nin Melancholia is simply gorgeous to\nlook at, although the most dramatic\nmoments do require patience to truly\nset in. He is terribly fond of that Wagner soundtrack, which he uses to its\nmaximum level as it crescendoes and\ncrescendoes to the whopping big fi-nale. It\u2019s an awe-inspiring, unforgettably charged moment of wonder,\nfrom a director who usually tends to\nstay away from using grand special\neffects. But von Trier never forgets\nwhose story he wants to tell. This is\nabout the mental unravelling of two\nsisters facing the apocalypse, and he\nnever steers away from his pitch-per-fect, outstanding leads. It\u2019s not an easy\nfilm to watch by any means, any film\nby von Trier carries with it a certain\nkind of expectation that it won\u2019t be a\nmood-lifting, particularly joyful film,\nbut the gripping dynamic between\nthe two central women, surrounded\nby impending disaster, is completely\noriginal, and oddly sensational. The\ndirector\u2019s reputation and his anti-so-cial nature might have made the film\nhard to advertise for and to attract\nmuch attention upon its release, but\nnow that the controversy has almost\nsettled down, it\u2019s about time to focus\non his actual work, without prejudice,\nand marvel at his wondrous new cinematic achievement.\nThere\u2019s a fine line between what\u2019s art\nand what\u2019s downright filth and por-nography. Blue Velvet is art, Caligula\nmost certainly is not, and as for Intimacy, I can argue for both. Lars von\nTrier enjoys pushing the boundaries\nwith his films but his most recent Antichrist is his most challenging film\nyet. There have been so many stories\nsurrounding the film, so many condemning the violence that a lot of\npeople I know went to satisfy their cu-riosity. Half of them walked out and a\nfew of them ran out at some point in\nthe film. To be fair, there were people\nfainting and walking out at the Cannes\nFilm Festival so who can blame them?\nThe film is divided into four chapters plus a prologue and an epilogue.\nWithin five minutes into the film,\nthere\u2019s a graphic sex scene which quite\nproudly shows the male genitalia in\n(God help us) slow-motion. Whilst\nHe (Willem Dafoe) and She (Char-lotte Gainsbourg) are having passionate sex, their young child falls out of\na window and dies. Already, the film\nis giving off an incredibly disturbing\nand sinister vibe. Trying to deal with\ntheir grief, they travel to Eden, a cabin\nin the middle of the woods detached\nfrom the rest of the world. Since He\nis a psychiatrist, they try therapy but\nwhen nature that surrounds them\nstart turning more and more evil and\nsinister, you know they won\u2019t last long\nat all.\nAll the horror stories involving the\nexplicit nature of this film are all true.\nThere\u2019s female castration, ejaculation\nof blood, self-harm, and the list goes\non and on. How someone comes up\nwith these ideas is beyond me and if\nyou can\u2019t handle violence and gore, it\u2019s\nobviously best to avoid this.\nBut before the final act, the film\nremains relatively calm, moving at a\nsteady pace, engaging the audience\nwith some intense character develop-ment. The build-up towards these horrific violent sexual acts is in fact very\nimpressive. How von Trier uses trees,\nanimals (one of them is a talking fox,\ngrowling \u201cchaos reigns\u201d), grass, and\neven conkers to bring out the characters\u2019 deepest, darkest fears is handled\nAntichrist\nDirector: Lars von Trier\nWriter: Lars von Trier\nStarring: Willem Dafoe, Charlotte\nGainsbourg\nRuntime: 108 minutes\nCertification: 18\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nwith absolutely no violence, very little\nsoundtrack, relying completely on the\natmosphere of the creepy forest. Von\nTrier clearly shows that He and She\nare changing simultaneously with the\nenvironment. As the events start getting more and more disturbing, and as\nthey occur more and more frequently,\ntheir attitudes towards one another\nbecome more hateful, fuelled by anger\nand lust.\nTo an extent, why these two characters end up in such a psychological mess is explained. They are both\nwrecked with guilt, She being more\naffected than He. Their feelings become repressed until She snaps and\nspirals out of control. This process is\nportrayed perfectly by the two leads.\nGainsbourg is so utterly convincing\nthat even at the slightest hint of her\nmind deviating from sanity, we are all\nnaturally bracing ourselves for something terrible. Dafoe tries desperately\nto help her but ends up becoming a\nvictim to her cruel acts. They have terrific chemistry together, showing their\ndeteriorating relationship with plenty\nof energy.\nSo the discomforting setting and\nboth actors have been very successful\nso far at giving us plenty of terror. Did\nvon Trier really need to go into all the\nviolence? Was excessive violence yet\nanother one of his brave experimental cinematic techniques? We\u2019ll never\nknow, since his interviews provide no\ndetailed insight into how he came to\nwrite and direct this film.\nAntichrist should most preferably be\nseen on your own. If you at no point\ncry, faint, run out of the room or vom-it, you\u2019ve done well for yourself. Such\na shame: the atmospheric, artistic beginning was shaping up to be one of\nthe most original recent horror mov-ies. But then von Trier had to overload\nthe screen with horrific violence towards the end.\n\n"

I am developing a Student\nConsultation framework in order to fulfill this promise. It is a framework that\nwill ensure that students are given enough input into decision-making that\naffects them, before decisions are made. I am asking for your help because it is\nimportant that there is strong student feedback to influence what the finished\nframework will look like.\nTo help please go to http://tinyurl.com/qfeudwa in order to view the\nframework. Please e-mail me with any feedback you have at union.president@\nic.ac.uk. Otherwise you are welcome to attend Union Council at 18:30 on the\n11th March in the Union Dining Hall (Floor 1, Union Building), where I will be\npresenting the framework, to give your feedback.\nThe aim of the framework is to standardise what students and staff together\nbelieve constitutes \u2018appropriate consultation with students\u2019 based on the impact\nof a decision being made. The framework produces for the user recommended\nconsultation methods and avenues for acting on them. By doing this we set a\nminimum standard for how and how much students are consulted on decisions\nthat affect them.\nI have so far individually consulted with student reps and 15 senior members\nof College staff2\nin order to produce a workable draft. I am now bringing this\ndraft to Union Council, the Union newsletter, Felix and my blog to give students\nthe opportunity to feed back with their thoughts. This will heavily inform what\nthe next draft will look like. I will also be presenting it for feedback to more\nCollege staff (including the Rector and the Provost), at the four Faculty Teaching\nCommittees, three quality committees, the Provost\u2019s Board, College Senate and\nCollege Council3\nbefore running a campaign to make people aware of it- this will\ninclude training student officers in its use.\nNot only does undergoing such a thorough consultation in developing a\n\u2018consultation framework\u2019 avoid hypocrisy, it also ensures that this framework\nhas true buy-in and input from all stakeholders and will therefore be trusted as\na useful tool.\nQuestions I would like you to consider:\nI\u2019m looking to get feedback or suggestions on any part of the mechanism and\nits implementation. I have though included some ideas for specific feedback that\nwould be particularly useful for me:\n1. Do you agree with the impact level each example has been placed against?\n(pg. 6 + 7)\n2.

We can spice up customary balls with\nadd ons such as performing acts, tasty treats and much\nmore! More events in collaboration with other faculty\nunions will allow for a larger budget and new exciting\nvenues.\nBroader career events - Students often tell me that\nthey would like to see more career events that are not\nbanking based. If elected, I would incorporate more\nsectors such as Science Communication, PR and\nhealth economics in career talks.\nEuro trip - Next year, I\u2019d like for RCSU students\nto have the chance to go abroad with their fellow\nscientists for an affordable getaway weekend.\nStronger academic representation - In my role as AAO,\nI learnt that students were particularly concerned\nabout exam feedback and coursework guidance. If\nelected, I will strongly lobby to obtain these.\nBroader events - I would introduce a range of events\nthat cater to all interests, such as poker tournaments,\ngaming events and tea parties!\nVote for a year you\u2019ll never forget, vote Cecile!\nHi!

    "content": "52 FRIDAY 07 MAR\nGAMES\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Calum Skene,\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIs Competition really that good?\nS\ntarbound is a platform\nadventure game currently\nin beta and being developed\nby Chucklefish Games, a\nUK indie games studio. I\nlove this game! I am eight hours in\nand I\u2019ve barely even scratched the\nsurface of all that is available in this\ngame. Indeed I\u2019ve only just completed\nthe tutorial, a fun yet disheartening\nexperience that will be shared later in\nthis review. This game is special, and\nnot just because fellow games Editor\nMax bought it for me at Christmas or\nbecause it\u2019s an indie game. Read on to\nfind out why you should spend your\ntime playing this game.\nAt first impressions Starbound can\nbe described as a sort of 2D version of\nMinecraft, a lot like Terraria, except it\nis set in space. When you start out you\nget to choose between 6 races which\nare all different. At the moment, the\nraces are sort of similar, apart from\nappearance, but each race does get its\nown armour, weapons and recipes. I\npicked the Avian race, bird looking\ncreatures who can\u2019t fly but are fierce\nwarriors. You start the game aboard\nyour spacecraft, however you have\nno fuel! Stranded in space you must\nbeam yourself down to the nearest\nplanet and survive while gathering\nmaterials.\nFor new players the game provides a\nhandy tutorial, and you are rewarded\nmoney for completing it. It was simple\nto start with, and my Avian character\nwas doing well. I built a campfire,\na workbench and a hunting bow to\nhunt the variety of alien creatures the\nplanet has. The alien enemy creatures\nremind me a lot of Pok\u00e9mon and the\ngame tells you the attacks they are\nmaking. One in particular reminded\nme of Psyduck as it picked me up and\ndropped me using gravity slam. After\nmy relaxing time hunting to get meat,\nand mining, I was presented with\nthe final quest in the tutorial. I had\nto build a distress beacon to attract\nattention from passing spaceships.\nThe recipe for the distress beacon\nneeded a lot more materials than\nanything I had built before so off I\nwent mining into the deeps, and I\nmean deep! You can dig down far, and\nfind dungeons with treasure chests,\nabandoned research centres filled\nwith money and different enemies. I\nspent nearly two hours mining and\nthe varied landscape helped keep\nthe game fresh. Down in the deeps I\ndiscovered more problems than just\nenemies. It is cold when you go down\nfar, and if you are away from a torch\nor campfire you freeze to death, but\nit is not the cold that killed me. In the\nunderbelly of the planet my Avian\ncreature died of hunger as I failed to\nfind monsters to hunt for meat. Dying\nin this way, although frustrating,\nwas a lot more interesting than just\nbeing killed by monsters. Back on\nthe surface after re-hatching from an\negg I had the materials for a distress\nbeacon. Ignoring the messages to\nproperly prepare I used the distress\nbeacon and all my materials with\nit and got destroyed by a UFO that\ncame down. I was in shock, 2 hours\nwere completely wasted as I needed to\nbuild a new distress beacon to call the\nUFO back and this time be prepared to\ndestroy it. My need for revenge drove\nme through the 3 hour mining session\nI needed to get enough materials\nto build a full set of armour. I even\nI\nseem to be in a bit of a gaming\nrut at the moment. I bought a\nfew games in the Steam sales and\nin Humble Bundles that I haven\u2019t\ngiven due gaming time. Instead\nof exploring the vastness of my steam\nlibrary, I am always playing the same\ngame: CounterStrike Global Offensive.\nFor all you who don\u2019t know what\nCounterStrike is or haven\u2019t read my\nprevious articles, CounterStrike is a\nsuper-successful series made by Valve\nbased on a mod of the Half Life series.\nEither as a terrorist or a counter-terrorist, you attempt to achieve your\ngoals, like planting a bomb, defusing a\nbomb or killing your opponents, whilst\ntrying to stop your enemy doing the\nsame.\nmoreso than anyone would expect.\nI, myself, enjoy this game mode very\nmuch, but at the start I found that I was\nquite lost. For beginners, the maps and\nstrategies, the tension and pressure can\nreally be too much. I recently played\nwith Calum, the game\u2019s co-editor, and\none of our teammates got so frustrated\nwell as your win percentage influence\nyour global rank and rating. The best\nof the best can be scouted for pro\nteams, and actually compete for serious\nmoney.\nThis, coupled with the tension and\nexcitement of the individual round,\nreally adds to this game\u2019s replay value,\nat the beginner skills of Calum that he\nactually told him to commit suicide (or\nsomething to that effect which can not\nbe printed). Thus, if you are a beginner,\nstay away from this mode and play the\nmore casual game modes.\nThe best and simultaneously worst\nthing about the competitive mode\nis your teammates. They make or\nbreak a great gaming session. If you\nget enthusiastic, funny and great\ncompanions, make sure you friend\nthem as they really make playing CS\nGO enjoyable in any form. On the\nother hand, if you encounter those\ndouchebags who surrender at any sign\nof difficulty, leave or are just a**holes\nthen I feel sorry for you.\nCompetitive matchmaking is there to\nextend the number of hours you spend\nplaying CS, and it does so admirably,\nespecially if you are as competitive as I\nam. If this game is getting stale for you,\nseriously try out this game mode, you\nwon\u2019t regret it!\nwent to an Avian town and murdered\nand stole enough money to build the\nbeacon. My small wingless Avian had\nbeen though a lot, but this time, with\na lot of running, I was able to destroy\nthe UFO and the penguins it beamed\ndown to the surface to obtain the\nmolten core: a required material for\nthe Metalwork station.\nIf it hasn\u2019t come across in my epic\nadventure, this game is addictive.\nNot many games would hold my\nattention after having been destroyed\nby a UFO following a big mining\nsession. Starbound manages to keep\nyou entertained as the landscape is\nunexpected and changing. At one\npoint I jumped out of my seat as\nmeteors came down and destroyed\neverything near my house. Starbound\nhas lots to do already and it\u2019s just\nin beta. It differs from Minecraft\nby offering quests which keep you\nentertained when you don\u2019t know\nwhat to do as well as offering the\nsandbox experience that many enjoy.\nWhen you get good enough to leave\nyour first planet you can find new\nworlds with harder enemies, but\nincreased ore, and get money to buy\nmore powerful weapons. The game\nlooks beautiful and has calming music\nto accompany your journey through\nspace. I urge you all to buy Starbound\nnow and enjoy this great game while\nseeing how the game evolves through\nthe beta.\nMore than just a Terraria Clone\nCalum Skene, chopping and mining for survival as he is bound for the stars\nWhile this formula seems quite\nboring and repetitive, I would say not,\nas there are many different variations\nof the original game mode. This is not\na review of CS GO, however, but rather\na look at the competitive matchmaking\nsystem in which I have wasted so many\nhours.\nImagine what I described above, but\ninstead of just casual players, you have\na team of 5 all working together to\nwin, playing another team of 5 just as\ndetermined. Playing 30 rounds, 15 as\nterrorist and 15 as counter-terrorist,\nyou must win at least 16 to clinch\nvictory. If you die in a round that is it\nyou have to wait till the next round.\nFurthermore, once you have died you\ncan watch your team mates try to win.\nAll this combined can sometimes make\nemotions run high. If you are the last\nperson alive and you know that the\nrest of the team is watching you, the\npressure can be quite real.\nYour performance in the match as\nMaximilian Eggl\nGames Editor\n\n"

Using my past experience as president of\nthe union at college level, I promise to completely\ntransform the union into one that will be matched\nby none in terms of its socials and opportunities! But\nin order to do so, I need your help.

You wana know why you\nshould voterer for me ratherer than anyone who cared.\nWell I\u2019ll tell you later. But first , let me tell you what I\nwant, and therefore what you want - I want a little bit\nof chicken fried. A cold beer on a Friday night. A pair\nof jeans that fit just right. And the radio oooooon.\nNah but seriously, my main issue with Imperial is\nthat they still don\u2019t sell dip dabs on campus even after\nmy many letters.

The Union has been one of the best things\nabout my time here, but I want to make it even better\nfor even more people. I have observed and reported\non the Union as President of STOIC (the Student\nTelevision Society) for three years now and I\u2019ve seen\nwhat can be done to make it better. As President I\npromise to\n-Introduce ePetitioning to make sure that the Union\nis listening. At the moment it is not clear how you can\nmake your voice heard by College and the Union: an\nonline system to raise the issues that matter to you,\nand allows other students to support you, is absolutely\ncrucial.\n-Provide more support for students applying for\nstandalone Masters after completing an Imperial\nUndergraduate degree.\n-Create a Union resource for extra information on\ncourses, and a centralized textbook resale system.\n-Encourage the use of the Union during the day: there\nneeds to be a coffee machine and lunchtime menu.\n-Introduce better and more inclusive nights out in the\nUnion: as well as improving the club nights on offer\nwe also need to continue to run events not necessarily\nfocused on alcohol.\n-Keep students up to date with my progress with\nmonthly updates in Felix.\nFor my full manifesto, and expansion on the above\npoints visit votejonny.com.

Ten years, in fact. Partially\ndue to the length of time it took for the\noriginal film to actually turn a profit/\nbecome the absurdly large cult hit it is\ntoday (which is sort of a pre-requisite\nfor being a cult hit, in a way), partially\ndue to the multiple other commitments of the various creative types\ninvolved, partially due to some major\nquestions over whether a sequel was\nworth it or could ever actually be any\ngood. The law of sequels is a brutal\none, and \u2013 certainly from my memo-ry/the list from Scream 2, none of the\nfew exceptions that do exist are, in the\nstrictest sense (Scream 2 arguably being the closest, and that was a horror\nfilm first and foremost), not comedies.\nSo the odds are very much against Anchorman 2: The Pointless Subtitles are\nBack here.\nIn the broadest possible sense, Anchorman 2 somehow manages to\ndefy those horrible odds. It\u2019s snigger-inducing from the start, and there\u2019s\nenough material packed in here to\nguarantee at least a few out-and-out\nuncontrollable fits of laughter (assum-ing, of course, you were a fan of the\noriginal\u2019s slightly surreal sense of hu-mour). It\u2019s as quotable as the original\nin places (the level of improvisation allowed over the top of the baseline material creates some corkers), although\nit\u2019s never quite so brilliantly fresh. The\noriginal is so ingrained into almost\neveryone\u2019s brains that the idea of the\njokes (and film) going in the direction\nyou least expect is kind of the direction you most expect it to go. Which\nkills it slightly. In the moment, though,\nthat point is irrelevant. For those two\nhours of cinema, almost everything\nabout this film is hilarious, apart from\nthe few bits that aren\u2019t.\nIf you\u2019ll forgive that painfully obvious tautology, there are some noticeable flaws in Anchorman 2. Most\nnotably: it\u2019s too damn long, meaning\nit joins my ever growing list of films\nwhich would have been so much better if they\u2019d spent longer in the editing suite and less time on the screen.\nSeveral of the jokes are drawn out \u2013 in\nsome cases, that\u2019s the point, it\u2019s where\nthe laughs come from, in others, it kills\nthe laughter dead. Plus, with the only\nsemi-relevant plot (as before), it can\u2019t\nhelp but feel like things lose their way\nslightly, leaving the film feeling like it\u2019s\ntreading water at various points, firing\noff gags to distract you from its lack of\nmovement.\nThere\u2019s also heavy recycling of the\nold scenarios, often adopting the\ntried-and-tested sequel method of\nmaking it bigger. Again, in the moment \u2013 it\u2019s hilarious. The news team\nbattle in particular is a stand-out mo-ment, but it\u2019s still just repeating the\nsame gags as before with different\nfaces and different stakes.\nThrow in some obvious satire which\nmakes a really relevant point (which\nis then mostly ignored), and a few\njokes where it feels like maybe we\u2019re\nbeing uncomfortably invited to laugh\nat Brick and Chani, and Anchorman\n2 eventually boils out to more hits\nthan misses. It\u2019s much more fun if\nyou loved the original, and if you go\nin fully aware that this is very much\ndesigned to hit all those buttons again,\njust harder. And for a longer period of\ntime.\nSo, thanks to the nature of the filming\nof Anchorman 2, as with the original,\nthere exists an (almost) entirely different cut of the film. Same situations,\ndifferent jokes. In some cases, completely different spins on the storyline.\nWhich is inevitably what you\u2019re going to get when you film \u2018actual\u2019 takes\nbased around a solid script, then just\nlet some insanely funny and smart\npeople lose to improvise their way\naround it.\nOf course, this around, what with\nthe sequel being \u2018bigger\u2019 in every\nway, this alternate cut hasn\u2019t just\ngone straight to DVD. No, it\u2019s come\nout \u2013 for one week only, and for Ron\nBurgundy\u2019s last cinematic outing, according to director Adam McKay \u2013 in\ncinemas. With \u201c763 (approx.)\u201d new\njokes, if the posters are to be believed.\nI didn\u2019t count, for the record. That\u2019s\neffort.\nWhat isn\u2019t effort, though, is spotting the few moments of old material\n(I say \u2018old\u2019, I mean \u2018from the first film\nthat only came out in November and\nso is only \u2018old\u2019 in sense of the lifespan\nof a fly or something\u2019) that creep in.\nPresumably a funnier, or as funny,\ntake doesn\u2019t exist for those shots. For\nthe majority, though, this is an enormous quantity of new material, and it\ncompletely changes the feel and flow\nof the film. Several character beats\nare altered or dropped entirely, and\nthe ending (along with a few other\nminor scenes) is changed entirely. It\u2019s\nalso twenty minutes longer, which is\nseriously bordering on taking the piss\nfor a film like this, although it doesn\u2019t\nactually feel twenty minutes longer.\nWhether that\u2019s because the original\nfelt too damn long already, or because\nI fell asleep (I didn\u2019t, to my knowl-edge), I don\u2019t know (I do, it\u2019s because\nthe original \u2013 the original sequel, that\nis, because this isn\u2019t confusing enough\n\u2013 was too long, I didn\u2019t fall asleep).\nWeirdly, where dragging out jokes\nthe first time around had a habit of\nkilling them, here, the multiple sequences that are significantly prolonged from their predecessors actually feel funnier, as being given more\nroom to breathe allows them to open\nup far better. It\u2019s almost a reversal of\nquality \u2013 some of the weakest scenes\nbecome the strongest, and vice versa.\nUltimately though, it\u2019s a very weird\nfeeling watching this, especially when\nyou\u2019ve become familiar with the origi-nal. Jokes you\u2019ve grown to anticipate\nfail to appear, with entirely different\npunchlines appearing in their place,\nalthough there are welcome appearances from gags that made it into the\ntrailers but not the final cut, which\nis a nice \u2018familiar yet unfamiliar yet\ntechnically familiar\u2019 moment. If that\nmakes any sense, which I\u2019m almost\ncertain it doesn\u2019t.\nI feel slightly bad for scoring this,\nwhat with it being a derivative, alternative work rather than an actual film,\nper se, but the fact that much of the\nmaterial \u2013 while funny \u2013 just isn\u2019t as\nfunny as the jokes in the final cut, perhaps somewhat obviously, means it\u2019s\na weaker little cousin. It\u2019s still good,\nand it wouldn\u2019t have been too much of\na disappointment if this had been the\nreal thing. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m\nnot glad it wasn\u2019t.\n\n"

With my previous experience, I believe I\nam the best candidate to facilitate this for you.\nCouncil has a hugely important role in our Union: it\nis the place where our voices can truly be heard and is\nwhere the true power in the Union lies. Council needs\na Chair who can ensure that meetings are purposeful\nand effective.\nAs Council Chair I will:\n- bring professionalism to meetings. We might not be\nbeing paid but doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t speak and act to\nhigh standards. Accepting anything less from members\nresults in a Council which does not work well together\nor for us.\n- ensure that your representatives are being effective.\nI will ensure that it easy for you to check on your\nrepresentatives\u2019 attendance at meetings and on the\nmatters that have decided\n- why should you have to wait a month (or longer) to\nsee what decisions have been taken by Council\n- put student issues at the top of the Agenda and\nsupport Council in being proactive in dealing with\nconcerns. Why should we wait for College to fail at\nsupporting our needs before we act? The consultation\nframework currently being worked on by the Union\nPresident should allow us to be better informed about\nchanges, but unless Council acts on matters then there\nwill be little gain.\nFor more information and my full manifesto visit:\nhttp://pageeasy.com/councilchair/\nI am a third year undergraduate physicist and am\nChairman of RCS Motor Club.

The union is an\nincredibly important part of your student life, and\nstudent trustees play a role behind the scenes in\nrunning it.\nI have a wealth of experiences in various clubs\ncommittees, and have been a member of the union\ncouncil for the last 2 years, first as an ICSMSU\nordinary member, and this year as part of my role\nas Interfaith Officer. I have also played a role in the\nRecreational clubs committee as a communications\nofficer, facilitating inter-club communications as well\nas helping clubs out with grant applications.\nI know how the union works, what it can do, as well\nas its limitations, so I will be able to keep the union\nand sabbatical officers in line, but also know when\nthey\u2019re doing all they can. I will focus on delivering\naccountability and ensuring the long term viability\nof the union, and make sure mistakes made in the\npast are not repeated. I will continue attending union\ncouncil meetings in order to monitor the smooth day-to-day running of the union, as well as to voice your\nconcerns. I won\u2019t impress you with vague promises\nand grand schemes that I\u2019ll never be able to keep if\nelected; that\u2019s not what trustees are for.\nI am always available and contactable with various\nconcerns and ideas. I\u2019ve enjoyed representing you\nthese past few years, and would love to continue doing\nso!\ntl;dr I have broad experience across the Union, and am\nready to accept the responsibility the Student Trustee\nrole entails. Vote for me, Thomas: a Trustee you can\ntrust!\nHi Imperial! I\u2019m Thomas and in my third year of EEE.\nI\u2019ve seen the Union from a range of perspectives. I\nled EESoc (the Departmental Society for EEE), sat on\nCouncil for the past two years, and I\u2019m the current\nSystem Administrator (writing the Mums and Dads\nmatching algorithm!) for the Union (and was a year\nrep!). When it comes to ICU, I really have seen it all -pun intended!\nThe Trustee Board supervises the Union\u2019s long term\nstrategy, approves legal and financial decisions, and\nis the last step in the appeals process. My in depth\nknowledge of all parts of the Union is key to being\na good Trustee. The roles I have taken in the Union\nput me in good stead to oversee the Union\u2019s activities,\nand to accept the significant responsibility of being a\nTrustee. I want to give something back to the Union,\nand I believe there is no better role than Student\nTrustee.\nI have worked tightly with students and union staff\non various projects, and I am keen to continue to\nhelp the Union improve the student experience. I\nhave had significant exposure to decision making and\nchallenging conventional thought, both of which are\nneeded for a strong Trustee board to look after the\nUnion.\nVote for Thomas, a Trustee you can trust!\nShiladitya\nGhosh\nTagore\nNakornchai\nThomas\nLim\nStudent\nTrustees\n\n"

It\nstarted off in September, moved on\nthrough Christmas and ended up in\nMarch.\nHow much does this game mean\nto you?\nIt\u2019s a really important stepping stone\nbefore the UH final.\nHow does it feel to be playing at\nThe Stoop?\nWell, it isn\u2019t quite Teddington is it?\nWhere will this game be won and\nlost?\nThe Stoop.\nWhat is your prediction for the\ngame?\nA game of two halves that will be\ndecided after 80 minutes.\nThe Captain\u2019s Message:\nThis year has been a mixed one so far\nfor the Imperial Medicals 1st XV. The\nbeginning of the year was tough due to\narunofinjuriesandhavingtointegrate\na large amount of new members into\nthe team. However, since Christmas,\nthe injured have returned and under\nthe increased competition for places\nthe squad has thrived. This has led\nto a large group of players all capable\nof putting in a shift and a great team\natmosphere. Consequently, results\nhave improved and we are looking\nforward to continuing this good run\nof form into Varsity and the UH Cup.\nMICHAEL O\u2019CONNELL\n1ST Team Captain\nHow has your season been so far?\nThe IC 1st XV started the season\nwith the goals of promotion, a similar\ncup campaign to last year and to win\nVarsity. Unfortunately St Bart\u2019s have\ndominated the league, we are the\nonly team to have managed at least a\ndraw against them with Bart\u2019s winning\ntheir other eleven matches. A very\ncomfortable win over the Medics\nat the start of the season also puts a\nshine on the year. Our cup campaign\ncame to an end with a 1 point loss\nto St Marys after a very impressive\nperformance.\nHow much does this game mean\nto you?\nThe success or failure of our season\nrests on winning this game, it is\nhugely important for the team and\nthe motivation to win is incredibly\nhigh. We have been targeting this\ngame from the start of the season and\nalthough we have been trying to say\nthat it is just another game it is na\u00efve\nto think that the boys wont be more\npumped up than usual for this one.\nHow does it feel to be playing at\nThe Stoop?\nI was injured in my second year so\nlast year was the first time I was able to\nplay at the Stoop. It was an awesome\nexperience. It is also important not\nto overstate the importance of the\nstadium, people have been known to\nget overawed by the occasion and not\nto perform on the day.\nWhere will this game be won and\nlost?\nThere is a saying in rugby that\nsays the forwards decide who wins\nthe game and the backs decide by\nhow much. I believe in this and on\nWednesday the team that wins will\nbe the team that can dominate the set\npiece and the breakdown. Without\nthese key victories no team can gain\nany momentum and it is very difficult\nto win the game.\nWhat is your prediction for the\ngame?\nA spirited medic performance but\nIC will have too much for them over\nthe 80 minutes.\nPROVISIONAL LINE UPS\n(SUBJECT TO CHANGE)\n\n"

It goes without\nsaying that social\nnetwork users both\non Facebook and\nTwitter shared their\n\u2018in-depth\u2019 insights\n(ramblings) on the\nelaborate purchase,\nthoughts ranging\nfrom rational (how will\nFacebook monetize\nWhatsApp?) to the\ndownright, well, put\npolitely, irrational, ( i t \u2019 s\nthe end of the world as we know it).\nIt is an interesting situation worth\npondering however, why would\nFacebook, home to over 1 billion\nusers buy WhatsApp?\nTo begin with, Facebook spotted\nan opportunity to get into mobile\nand with its deep pockets made an\nacquisition that is difficult to fault.\nThey had initially tried to release HTC\nphones with a Facebook interface,\nwhich tanked spectacularly. Clearly\nnot an easy market to\nc o m p e t e\nin (see Google\u2019s\npurchase of Motorola), Facebook\nsimply did what most established\nentitiesdo, buythesmallercompetitor.\nGoogle had done the same when it\ntried to compete with YouTube and\nwound up buying the video streaming\nwebsite. So point number one,\nFacebook has apparently succeeded in\nexpanding its business portfolio to the\nmobile communication platform.\nThe chat feature on Facebook has\nbecome a diminished feature of the\nsocial networking site as users\nopted for private messaging.\nThat problem has been\nrectified somewhat\nby the integration\nof the messaging\nand chat feature,\nhowever, the\nchat feature\nr e m a i n s\ns w i t c h e d\noff by many\nof its users.\nW h a t s a p p\non the other\nhand provides\nan instant, user\nfriendly platform\namassing users all over the\nworld of close to 500 million\nusers. Through this acquisition, the\nfight for which messaging platform\nis of preference to the public has\nbeen extinguished, and Facebook\neffectively has decisively established\nan additional avenue through which\nto serve its users.\nFinally, statistics show that mobile\nphones share more photos through\nT\nhe fledgling cryptocurrency\nBitcoin suffered one of its\nbiggest setbacks this past\nweek when the (formerly)\nlargest exchange Mt. Gox\nfiled for bankruptcy protection.\nThe beleaguered exchange has been\nmarred by a string of management\nproblems before it filed for\nbankruptcy protection. Yet, the\ncurrency has been relatively stable\namidst all of these: after briefly\nfalling to US Dollars (USD) 400 per\nBitcoin after the news broke, it has\nnow recovered up to a steady state of\naround USD 650 at press time.\nDecentralisation is at the core of\nBitcoins through the clever use of\ncryptography. There is no central\nauthority to prove, or disprove that\nBitcoins are \u201cowned\u201d by anyone in\nparticular. There is a distributed\npublic ledger, known as the\n\u201cblockchain\u201d that keeps a log of all\nthe transactions that have ever taken\nplace between Bitcoin addresses. In\norder to \u201cspend\u201d the coins, one has\nhalted all trading activities. It\ncited a problem with \u201ctransaction\nmalleability\u201d, a known issue with\nthe Bitcoin protocol, as a reason for\ndoing so, and hinted that it had lost\nmoney to this problem. This was not\na catastrophic problem because if\nthe software were written properly,\nthey would be able to safeguard\nagainst this problem as many other\nBitcoin exchanges have done so.\nNevertheless, Mt Gox cited this as\na reason, and hinted that they have\nlost a significant amount of their\nmoney. Finally, on February 24, Mt\nGox shut down without a word and\nfiled for bankruptcy protection soon\nafter.\n\u201ccooling off\u201d, always blaming some\nglitch or another. Customers were\ncomplaining for weeks long waiting\nfor withdrawals, with some allegedly\nnever completing. Mt. Gox was also\nhaving to face several legal issues\nwith the US government. It was\nduring this time that other exchanges\nbegin to spring up and become more\nprominent due to the various issues\nfacing Mt Gox.\nOn February 7 2014, Mt. Gox\nYong Wen Chua, on the dangers of trusting an online currency\nRight away, the various exchanges\nissued a joint statement saying that\nthe problems at Mt Gox do not\nrepresent a problem with the Bitcoin\ncommunity at large. Bitcoin is not\ncentralised at Mt Gox, and the fall\nof a player, albeit a big one, does not\nspell the doom of Bitcoin. This sense\nof optimism seem to be shared by the\ncommunity. After falling rapidly on\nthe day Mt Gox shut down, the price\nof Bitcoin quickly rose and stabilised\nat a value higher than before Mt Gox\nshut down.\nPerhaps the old adage of having\nany publicity is good publicity rings\ntrue as Bitcoin turns a new page in\nits history.\nWhatsApp with FB?\nTola Makanjuola, on the social giants latest buy\nto prove ownership of the coins via\nthe use of private keys associated\nwith public Bitcoin addresses. In\nother words, with the blockchain,\nit is possible to trace how Bitcoins\nhave exchanged hands, and calculate\nexactly how many coins a certain\naddress has in its possession.\nThere are generally two ways\nto obtain Bitcoins: mining or\nexchanging with some fiat money.\nMt. Gox was one of these exchanges.\nFor some time, Mt. Gox was one of\nthe largest exchanges where people\ncould turn their USD into Bitcoins.\nBut according to some leaked\ndocuments and insider information,\nthe company was very badly managed\nand some claim that the writing was\non the wall for it to collapse.\nMt Gox suffered a series of\nsetbacks along its way. The first\nsetback that Mt Gox suffered was in\nlate 2011 when it suffered a breach\nto one of the textbook attacks: SQL\ninjection. Throughout 2013, Mt Gox\nwould periodically shut down for\nThe Mt Gox Bitcoin Debacle\nThe News Bubble\nMaximilian Eggl\nYong Wen Chua\nOsama Awara\nTechnology Editors\nThese days you cannot help but encounter Apple or oe of its products\nin your average life. Even if you don\u2019t own a product, your friends will.\nTherefore avoiding interacting with the fruity company has just gotten a\nbit harder. Apple just recently announced CarPlay, a system with which\nyou can connect your iOS device to your car. However, at the moment\nthis is only available in Ferrari, Mercedes and Volvo cars. Apple does\nplan to release this feature with BMW, Nissan, Kia just to mention a few.\nTherefore if you buy a car in the future, you might hear Siri\u2019s sweet, sweet\nvoice from your car\u2019s stereo.\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up\nto date with the newest, weirdest and most futuristic things\naround\nApple in Cars\nWhatsApp than on Facebook, a key\nactivity that has made Facebook so\npopular over the years. Probably\nmore importantly is the fact that this\nactivity is occurring in developing\ncountries, where the app has grown\nimmensely in popularity. Facebook\nhave therefore seen an opportunity\nto expand into those regions in a bid\nto \u201cmake the world more open and\nconnected\u201d.\nJust days after the acquisition,\nWhatsApp had an outage for 3\nconsecutive days, not necessarily\na great start to the partnership\nwhich will see WhatsApp remain\nindependent, but certainly not the\nend of the world\u2026.is it?\nFacebook on spending spree\nAfter the WhatsApp acquisition (which you can read all about in the\nbrilliant article by Tola Makanjuola), most of us would have a well\ndeserved, and perhaps guilty, rest. Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t seem to want\na rest. To further his Internet.org initiative, Facebook is now going after\ndrone manufacturer Titan Aerospace for a purported 60 million dollars.\nThese drones then would fly over internet starved regions, beaming\ninternet (among them surely Facebook) to potential users below.\n\n"

Indeed, one of the most moving\naspects of this display is Callahan\u2019s\nreverence for the beauty present in\neverydaylife.AChicagoStreet,acarpet\nof autumn leaves; the photographer\u2019s\nsubjects are unremarkable, yet his\nimages are endowed with a humble\nbeauty.\nConsidered to be one of the pioneers\nof20thcenturyAmericanphotography\nand the New Vision Movement,\nCallahan was self-taught. He began\ntaking pictures with Chrysler Motor\u2019s\nPhoto Club during his time as a clerk\nwith the company in Detroit, and was\ninspired by the work of landscape\nphotographer Ansel Adams to pursue\nphotography seriously from age 26,\nin 1941. Rejecting the prevailing\ntrend for documentation of current\nevents, Callahan preferred to draw\nupon his everyday surroundings\nin Detroit and Chicago for subject\nmatter. His modern style earned\nhim a teaching position at Chicago\u2019s\nInstitute of Design and later the Rhode\nIsland School of Design, culminating\nin a retrospective at the Museum\nof Modern Art (MoMA) in 1976.\nHowever, whilst critically acclaimed\nin the States, Callahan\u2019s name is little-known outside of art circles in the UK.\nTate Modern\u2019s exhibit aims to bring his\nwork this side of the pond.\nThe display spans Callahan\u2019s work\nfrom post-war black and white shots\nof Chicago to his colour images\nof the seventies. Callahan\u2019s early\nurban images are testimony to his\nphotographic craftsmanship, and\nability to capture the mood of 1950s\nChicago. His crisp silver gelatin prints\nlend themselves well to the clean lines\nof the buildings in his photographs,\nand complement his interest in form.\nThese urban images have a sombre\nbeauty. Shadow dominates his\nphotographs (the dense darkness\nof Wabash Street, 1958 is almost\ntangible) and many cityscapes are\ndeserted. Where pedestrians are\npresent, they seem unaware of the\ncamera and Callahan is careful to\npreserve their anonymity. Men gather\non a street corner in the uniforms of\n50s Chicago, grey suits, their faces\nobscured beneath hat brims.\nThe same sobriety pervades\nCallahan\u2019s natural landscapes \u2013 in\nDetroit, 1941 a telegraph pole stands\nsolitary in a field. Callahan\u2019s eye for\nminutiaeisevidentinsomeofhisclose-range shots of buildings or landscapes,\nleading to a deconstruction of the\nsubject\u2019s form and lending his images\na mischievous abstract quality. His\nclose-ups of windswept Georgia\nMountain grasses could be mistaken\nfor a dog\u2019s coat, his cropped snapshots\nof New York skyscrapers equally\ncryptic. Callahan\u2019s use of multiple film\nexposure, allowing for superposition\nof images, creates some pictures that\nverge on the surreal; a nude female\nfloats eerily on the side of a skyscraper\nin Providence-Nude on Building, 1970.\nThe display divides Callahan\u2019s work\naccording to three main themes:\nnature, buildings and people. However,\nit is arguable that the only person really\npresent in the images here is Callahan\u2019s\nwife Eleanor, who compliantly posed\nfor him \u201crain or shine, whatever (she)\nwas doing\u201d throughout the 63 years\nof their marriage. Eleanor\u2019s presence\ncan be heavily felt in different aspects\nof his work. She appears nude in an\napartment, then fully clothed against\nbleak winter landscapes, at distant\nor close range. In Eleanor, 1949 she\nemerges nymph-like from a lake, a\nnipple peeking from the glassy water.\nWe are presented with close-up shots\nof portions of Eleanor\u2019s body, and\nusing multiple exposure, Eleanor\u2019s\nnaked torso shimmers in front of the\nlandscape in Aix-en-Provence, 1958.\nIt has been suggested that Tate\nRhian Jones\nWriter\nWhat: Hannah Hoch\nWhere: Whitechapel Gallery, E1\nWhen: Until 23rd March\nPrice: \u00a39,95, \u00a37.95 concessions\nWitty, irreverent, political collages\nJingjie Cheng\nWriter\nI\nn Heads of State (1920), two\nportly figures are pictured in their\nbathing suits before a feminine\nbackdrop of butterflies, flowers\nand a woman with a parasol.\nOne figure is the first president of the\nWeimar republic, Friedrich Ebert, and\nthe other, his defence minister.\nIt is such comical and emasculating\njuxtapositions that make Hannah\nHoch\u2019s collages so subversive and\nentertaining. A pioneer of the\nphotomontage technique, Hoch draws\nfrom journals and magazines to put\nvastly disparate elements together,\ncreating whimsical, counterintuitive\nand sometimes irreverent pieces that\ncomment on the political and social\nchanges of the turbulent period in\npost-World War I Germany. A key\ncontributor to the Berlin Dadaist\nmovement but slighted by the\nother mainly male members, Hoch\nnevertheless left her mark as a witty,\noriginal artist who somehow managed\nto combine images into coherent\nwholes that tell stories of their own.\nAlthough it is greatly disappointing\nthat her arguably most famous\nwork, and icon of the Berlin Dada\nmovement, Cut with the Kitchen Knife\nthrough the Last Weimar Beer-Belly\nCultural Epoch in Germany (1920) is\nnot on show, as the fragile original sits\ndelicately in the Neue Nationalgalerie\nofBerlin,thisexhibitionisnevertheless\nimportant in shedding light on her\ncontributions to 20th century collage,\nas well as to the politically charged\nbody of art of the time. Being the first\nmajor exhibition of her works in the\nUK, with more than a hundred pieces\nspanning from 1910s to 1970s, the\nshow puts this woman in the well-deserved spotlight.\nHoch had studied at the School\nof Applied Art in Berlin before\nworking at the well-known Ullstein\npublishing house. Her early works\nsaw a confluence of her background in\nfunctional art and aesthetics itself, as\nshe drew inspiration from embroidery\nto create two-dimensional art\nreminiscent of tessellation. These\nearly works reflect interplay between\npatterns and human figures, often\nnudes, with the geometric blending\ninto the organic. Already we can\ndetect an interest in collage \u2013 the work\nWhite Cloud (1916) uses fragments of\nprinted designs.\nThe ground floor of the exhibition\nfollows the works of her Dada, or \u2018antiart period. Hoch often expressed her\nDadaistappealtoirrationalandchance\nhumour through collages that subvert\ninstitutions. Perhaps influenced by\nthe cubist works of her time, Hoch\u2019s\nworks are often disproportionate and\ncontain conflicting perspectives. High\nFinance (1923) depicts two large-headed men in suits tangled up with\na huge gun and military equipment \u2013\na sharp criticism of military-industry\ncollusion in the republic. I found her\ncollages extraordinarily refreshing for\ntheir blatant irreverence.\nIn her words, her photomontages\n\u201ccannibalise the images of popular\nculture to satirise not only political\nfigures but also gender inequality\nand sexual stereotypes\u201d. Indeed,\nher important series From an\nEthnographic Museum challenges\nconventional concepts of beauty by\njuxtaposing mainly female body parts\nwith ethnographic objects. Said to\nhave been inspired by a visit to such\na place, the works in this series are at\nonce bestial and strangely beautiful, as\nwe acknowledge that there is aesthetic\nvalue in bringing different things\ntogether \u2013 an idea that went against\nnot only the prevailing idea of beauty\nbut more broadly, the totalising\nideologies of National Socialism.\nThese works may also be a comment\non colonialism and exoticism,\nquestioning traditional boundaries\nof race and culture. She sums up her\npurposes best in her own words in the\ncatalogue of her first solo exhibition\nat The Hague in 1929 \u2013 \u201cI would\nlike to blur the firm borders that we\nhuman beings, cocksure as we are, are\ninclined to erect around everything\nthat is accessible to us...I want to show\nthat the small can be large, and large\nsmall, it is just the standpoint from\nwhich we judge that changes, and\nevery concept loses its validity.\u201d\nThe exhibition extends to two\ngalleries upstairs, one of which shows\nher massive scrapbooking project\nAlbum, created during Nazi rule\nwhen, in danger of persecution, she\navoided public life and lived quietly in\nthe Berlin suburbs. The other gallery\ndisplays Hoch\u2019s post-war works,\nwhich took a turn from her Dada past\nand looked to nature for inspiration,\nbecoming increasingly abstract and\ncolourful. It is almost as if her works\nreflected the liberation she felt after\nthe war, free from Nazi rule.\nHowever, for me, Hoch will always\nbe remembered by her bold and\nunapologetic political and social\ncommentary of her Dada period. It\nis her matter-of-fact laying out of her\nuncensored opinions that give her\ncollages an irreverent charm which\ntickles the surface, but at the same\ntime, excavates important issues and\nplaces them starkly out in the open.\noverstates the importance of Harry\nCallahan as \u201cone of the most influential\nfigures in post-war photography\u201d, and\nthis small display only provides a taster\nof his work (around 90 photographs).\nNonetheless, this retrospective \u2013\nintimate, succinct and neatly curated \u2013\nis a photographic masterclass that is in\ndanger of being overlooked. So when\nyou head to the Tate Modern to see the\nheavily publicised Paul Klee or Richard\nHamilton exhibitions, make sure that\nyou drop by.\nHarry Callahan, Providence, 1966 \u00a9 Estate of Harry Callahan\nCOLLECTION OF IFA, STUTTGART\nHannah Hoch, Heads of State, 1918-20\n\n"

The publicity it\nreceives in the media reflects\nits profound importance\nin modern day political discourse.\nIt would be true to say that the vast\nmajority of extremism that we hear\nof is Islamic in nature, but it would be\nignorant of us to restrict our opinions\non extremism only to what we hear in\nthe media. In order for a person to be\nable to participate fully in a discussion\non extremism, he must first appreciate\nthe fact that extremism can permeate\ninto any subject matter, be it political,\nreligious, economic or otherwise.\nThen he must understand that his\nview on extremism is not shared by\nall: extremism is a fundamentally\nsubjective matter. What is considered\nextremist to one person may not be to\nanother.\nThe most appropriate forum for the\nanalysis of extremism is in a public\ndebate where all views are free to air\nin a non-judgmental atmosphere. I\nbelieve that the IC Extremism Seminar\nencapsulated all of these qualities, and\nas a result, all present were able to\nput forward their arguments in total\nconfidence that they would not be\njudged for them. This made for one\nof the most stimulating debates I have\never been part of, both at Imperial\nand outside Imperial. Although\nnothing was overtly concluded overall\nfrom the discussion, I feel that all\npresent, including the speakers,\ncame away with an altered opinion\non how extremism manifests and its\nimportance in their daily lives.\nIt was an absolute pleasure working\nwith the Joseph Interfaith Foundation,\nthe Islamic Society and Catholic\nSociety on the seminar. The way the\nsocieties worked together is testament\nto the strong interfaith relations\npresent on campus here at Imperial.\nEveryone present approached\nthe interfaith discussions with a\ncompletely open mind, willing to learn\nabout the traditions of other religions\nto broaden their already considerable\nknowledge of interfaith.\nEvents like these encompass the true\nspirit of interfaith and I am hopeful\nthat there will be many more interfaith\nevents to come in the remainder of\nthis academic year, to which you are\nall invited!\nComment: Yusuf Qureshi\n(ISoc)\nE\nxtremism. A word which\nbombards us everyday in\nthe media and has some\nform of definition in every\nsingle person\u2019s vocabulary.\nThe basic definition of extremism\nis the maximum possible deviation\nfrom a central reference point, which\nin a religious context, would be our\nProphets and scriptures. That being\nsaid, extremism is not necessarily\nviolent. It is possible to be extreme\nin seemingly noble deeds such as\nprayer, fasting and even charity!\nThe topic discussed, however, was a\nspecific form of extremism; namely\nviolence in the name of religion. As\na Muslim, you would imagine that I\nshall now proceed to ramble on about\nhow Islam is a peaceful religion and\nhow the people who commit such\ndisgusting and heinous crimes are\ndefinitely not acting within the realms\nof Islamic law. I won\u2019t. Remember\nthe aforementioned central reference\npoint? For Muslims, it is the Quran and\nthe way of the Prophet Muhammad\n(Peace and Blessings be upon him).\nMuslims embrace the Quran as the\nword of God, who states that \u201dwhoever\nkills a soul unless for a soul or for\ncorruption [done] in the land - it is as\nif he had slain mankind entirely. And\nwhoever saves one - it is as if he had\nsaved mankind entirely.\u201d [5:32]. As a\nMuslim, when I see such disregard for\nhuman life from people who claim to\nfollow the same book and Prophet as\nmyself, I can\u2019t help but wonder, have\nthey even read the Quran? Have they\nany notion of how many times they\u2019ve\nslain the whole of mankind in the sight\nof God? Surely, had anybody read this\nverse, it would speak volumes on the\nsanctity of life in Islam?\nThe fact of the matter is that \u201cviolent\nreligious extremism\u201d almost never\nhas any religious motivation behind\nit. When speaking about extremism,\ntwo groups of people spring to mind.\nIn any given ideology, there will be\npeople who are willing to defame its\nname for their own reasons; generally\npolitical.\nThis is the first group: few in number\nbut with a clear but malicious vision.\n\u2018Predators\u2019 is a good description.\nThe second faction is comprised of\nignorant zealots, people who have\nimmense enthusiasm for their religion\nbut lack knowledge of its teachings;\npuppets. To put it very simply, the\nlatter are manipulated by the former,\nwho exploit the ignorance to give the\nillusion that the basis of these actions\nare religious teachings.\nThe solution is very simple:\nEducation and stemming the flow\nof naive enthusiasts, ensuring that\nthe predators are starved of puppets.\nWe should see that religious leaders\nare properly educated and trained in\nthe knowledge of their own religions\nand the state of current affairs and\npolitical climate, empowering them\nto take control of the surrounding\ncommunity and to direct the energy of\nenthusiasts into something productive\nand beneficial to society.\nComment: Theo Susanto\n(CathSoc)\nJ\nIF is among the rare chances\nwhere different faith\ngroups can engage in open\ndiscussion.\nThis is the second year I\nrepresented CathSoc. Unfortunately\nthis year, I was less prepared. I was ill\nand still losing my voice; I was really\nnervous and I stuttered often.\nDespite that, people gave me\ntremendous support and made\nme comfortable in continuing the\ndialogue.\nMs Mehri Niknam is extremely\nenthusiastic and always pushes us\nto loosen formalities and political\ncorrectness. Without which, a fruitful\nand meaningful discussion would be\ndifficult to achieve\nPersonally I am always anxious\nabout the event; being put out of my\ncomfort zone. There is always the\nworry that the words I uttered were\nnot those that I intended, that I was\nnot representing the views of my faith\nproperly.\nThis year\u2019s event is different though;\ninstead of representing my faith, I was\nthere to discuss strictly my thoughts,\nand my rather mild experiences\npertaining to extremism.\nIt was a powerful feeling to hear\nstories from other people about\ntheir experience: Harassment as\nwhat Benison had experienced can\nhappen to anyone around us. Often\nwe do not notice; little things that may\npush someone to the edge constantly\nhappen.\nAmong some of the privileged,\nI tend to overlook the fact that\nextremism does not just occur with\nsensationalistic violence in some\nfaraway land; dialogue such as this\nserves as a powerful reminder, that\nsuch misfortunes could happen to\nsomeone we can relate to.\nAt first, it seems that only extreme\nconstraints warrant such extreme\nreactions. However, it is apparent\nfrom the dialogue that the root was\nnot just the constraints, but also the\ninclination to accuse the \u2018other\u2019; to\nfind scapegoats on the matters that\nbefall the community.\nSuch unfortunate chain of events is\npossible mainly due to the suppression\nby those with knowledge and vision.\nAmazing is the significance of a strong\nwill, no matter how twisted it is, in\nspilling out and influencing others to\nfollow it.\nIt would be great for events such\nas this to grow, as they create a\ncomfortable place for people to engage\ntheir viewpoints, build or rebuke their\nprinciples, and often to allow people\nto hear the other side of the story.\nSometimes we get too comfortable\nwith our own community.

Recently, this newspaper\nhas become a self-contained unit rather than serving\nall of Imperial. I believe that for Felix to be something\nthat speaks to and for all students we need to involve\nall of Imperial. I would like to achieve this by starting a\nsurvey, to help the reader shape Felix.\nAdditionally, I hope to involve more students by\nconsulting societies for certain sections as well as\ndirectly interacting with students through Facebook\n& Twitter and having a meet-and-greet sessions.\nFurthermore, it is paramount for Felix to have a\nseparate team to organise events and publicity, as well\nas a team of online editors to manage internet content.\nPostgraduates are an important part of Imperial but\nFelix tends to ignore them. I will change the rounds to\ninclude distribution points in postgrad areas too. I will\nalso encourage postgrads to submit articles about their\nresearch, making Felix more Imperial-centred.\nI plan to distribute Felix every Friday in the morning,\nso it\u2019s there for that 9am lecture. I will also increase\nthe number of copy editors to reduce mistakes and\ntypos. Lastly, I will better integrate the website and app\ntogether.\nDue to the rebuilding of the union, the new Felix\neditor will have the opportunity to shape the future\nof the newspaper. Having worked as Technology and\nGames Editors, I have invaluable experience to make\nFelix the voice Imperial deserves. We need the max\nfrom Felix, so put Max in Felix!\nI have been involved with Felix since I first came to\nImperial and I have developed a great passion for it.\nTwo years ago I restarted the paper\u2019s Books section\nand have been its editor ever since. This January I also\njoined the paper\u2019s News editorial team. I have written\nover 140 articles, both for these two sections as well as\nmany others, including Film, Television and Science.\nFelix is such a great paper because of the huge amount\nof effort put into it by ordinary Imperial students. I\nwould therefore want to make it less daunting to get\ninvolved in contributing. I would also regularly meet\nwith students to find out their concerns and their ideas\non how to improve Felix.\nI understand how important clubs and societies are\nfor many at Imperial and so I would make it easier for\ndifferent groups to publicise their events. In particular,\nhaving been Chair of the Media Executive this year,\nI understand the importance of collaboration with\ngroups like STOIC and IC Radio.\nOne of the key roles of Felix is holding the Union to\naccount. Having sat on the Union Council and the\nClubs, Societies and Projects Board I know a lot about\nhow the Union works. I will attend all important\nUnion meetings and make sure that you are kept\ninformed of what really matters to you.\nFor more information check out my campaign website\n(www.VoteMaciej.com).

I want\nto change this issue by enabling students to identify\nschemes that work well for other Departments and\nadopt those in their own Departments.\nI have been the Biochemistry Year Representative for\nthree years running now. I have aimed to implement\nplatforms by which students collaborated and enriched\ntheir degree experience despite these difficulties. I\nwould like to implement similar platforms for all\nDepartments.\nMy plan involves creating a central website at which\nstudent support information is housed. While there are\nseveral sources throughout which this is spread, there\nis currently no one place any student can visit where\nthey can find both information pertinent to them (e.g.\nmitigating circumstances procedures, guidance sent\nto tutors, usual grade distributions, planned changes\nto the degree programme) and compare the support\navailable to them versus other Departments. In brief,\nthis website would amalgamate any information that\nusually \u2018floats on the grapevine\u2019 within Departments.\nThe purpose of these systems would be (a) to provide\nrepresentatives with definitive evidence about the\nefficacy (or lack thereof) of techniques implemented\nby other representatives and (b) to provide a public\nforum in which students can (anonymously) discuss\nissues pertinent to their educational experience at\nImperial. I will identify schemes (like interactive\nmarking and student-led tutorials) that students find\nwork well in their Departments and implement those\nschemes College-wide by using technology to provide\nstudents a place to voice their opinions.\nBradly\nKneisel\nConfused about what\u2019s going on?It\u2019s simple.I can help\nyou in 3 simple steps:\n1Vote IRINA\n2Proceed to the next position\n3Repeat step 1\nIrina\nMoraru\nI\u2019m Pascal, a third year EEE student and I\u2019m running\nfor Deputy President Education to ensure that you\nhave the best academic experience!\nI have previously been involved with the Union as\na year rep.

Pop culture\nas glue while I tear at the seams.\nWhen my sun goes supernova\nnothing will change for me.\nMy senses fled this sorry corpse, for without light\nnothing grows.\nFancy yourself a poet? Got an artwork you\u2019d like to share? Made a nice\norigami? Send submissions to arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk to showcase\nyour work in Felix.\nIs all art propaganda?\nA\nrt should comfort the\ndisturbed and disturb\nthe comfortable. It\u2019s an\ninstantly quotable adage\nfrom Banksy, but what\ndoes it actually mean? Can a line be\ndrawn between outright political\npropaganda and the canvases hanging\nin every hip gallery in London? Or\nis all art propaganda, as the title of\nGeorge Orwell\u2019s collection of critical\nessays claims? Visual media has the\nunique ability to reach the masses and\ninfluence thought and perception.\nDoes linking this to political ideology\nthreaten the integrity of the artist\nand the artwork itself, or is the art\ninformed and heightened by this social\nand political context?\nPropaganda and art have always\nbeen closely interlinked. War, in\nparticular often blurs the lines between\nart and propaganda. Dating back to\nclassical times, battle and its Generals\nhave been glorified through art, calling\nmen to arms. In modern times, as the\npublic consciousness has turned away\nfrom war, art has similarly reflected the\nturning tide of anti-war sentiment.\nA striking example is Picasso\u2019s\nGuernica; a visceral 11x25.6 ft canvas\ndepicting the horrors of war, and the\nmisery that followed the Nazi bombing\nof the Spanish town of Guernica\nduring the Spanish Civil War. It has\ngained fame for its bold political\nstatement, made stronger by its lack\nof colour; it\u2019s blue, black and white\ntones reminiscent more of newsprint\nand photographic documentation of\nthe time than of Picasso\u2019s usual style.\nThough Picasso himself always\nconsidered Guernica deeply political,\ncondemning violence, at the time\nof its unveiling in Paris it received\nlittle critical attention. In this respect\nit could be said to have failed in its\nrole as propaganda, never receiving\nenough critical acclaim or seen by\nIndira Mallik\nWriter\nenough people needed for truly\neffective propaganda. The piece has\ngone on to become a potent symbol\nof the destruction of war on the lives\nof innocent civilians. In many aspects,\nit is easy to fit Guernica neatly into\nthe box of \u2018art\u2019 despite its political\nundertones. Other art pieces are more\novertly propaganda.\nTake for example Rima Najdi, a\nmultidisciplinary Lebanese artist\nbased in Germany, who has taken to\nwalking the streets of Beirut dressed\nas a bomb. All in black except for a\nfake red dynamite suicide vest, Najdi\nhopes to highlight the danger the\ncitizens of Beirut face every day, and\nthe real fear they have of dying just\nstepping out of their homes. The idea\nfor the installation piece came as a\nresult of being a close to one of the\ncar bombs that hit downtown Beirut,\nand the predominantly Shia area of\nDahiyeh, where Hezbollah has a strong\npresence. Though without a doubt\nfood for thought, can Najdi\u2019s work be\nconsidered true art?\nJackson Pollock would\u2019ve thought\nnot; abstract expressionism, the 20th\ncentury movement of which Pollock\nwas a major figure, was based on\nthe ideal that art should be wholly\nseparated from ideology. Artists in\nthe movement considered art to be\nof a higher form, that should be kept\npure, and that the images or structures\nshould flow from within the artist\nwithout seeking to influence or impart\nany sort of social or political context. It\nwas the idea of \u2018art for art\u2019s sake\u2019, pure\naestheticism.\nBut even pure aestheticism cannot\nbe safe from becoming propaganda;\nultimately the power to judge an\nartwork lies in the hands of the viewer.\nIndeed, the work of the abstract\nexpressionists including Jackson\nPollock and Mark Rothko was adopted\nas propaganda during the Cold War.\nIn 1995, The Independent reported\nthat the CIA had confirmed that\nit had secretly funded the abstract\nexpressionists as a foil to the rigid\nsocialist realism of Soviet art, as a\nsymbol of American freedom and\ncreativity.\nTo address the question whether any\nattempt should be made to separate art\nfrom propaganda, we turn to Orwell\nwhen he writes in context of World\nWar II in his 1949 essay The Frontiers\nof Art and Propaganda, \u201cyou cannot\ntake a purely aesthetic interest in a\ndisease you are dying from\u201d. Speaking\nabout the way art was so endemically\njoined with war propaganda \u2013 take\nfor instance Rosie the Riveter who\nhas since become an icon of the\nwomen\u2019s war effort in the US, Orwell\nwrites \u201c[propaganda art] destroyed\nthe illusion of pure aestheticism\u2026\npropaganda in some form or other\nlurks in every work of art, [each] has\na meaning and a purpose \u2014 a political,\nsocial and religious purpose\u201d.\nIt seems art cannot exist outside of\nthe social and political context of its\ntime. Emphasisingformoversubstance\nnot only opens the artwork up to the\ndanger of being too academic for the\nmasses to enjoy, but often proves futile.\nOrwell goes on to write \u201cour aesthetic\njudgements are always coloured by our\nprejudices and beliefs.\u201d Thus even the\nmost innocuous abstract piece may\nbecome a political statement in the\nmind of a particular viewer.\nPablo Picasso, Guernica, 1937\nJackson Pollock, Number 11, 1952 national gallery of australiA\n\n"

    "content": "16 FRIDAY 07 MAR\nMUSIC\nEditor: Simon Hunter,\nRiaz Agahi, Stuart\nMasson\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nP\nrior to writing this review,\nI stumbled upon a recent\nYouTube recording of\nWild Beasts performing\na mellow and slightly\nmocking rendition of Miley Cyrus\u2019\nWrecking Ball. I watched this video\nprobably three or four times. This\nwas not just because I love Wrecking\nBall (who doesn\u2019t?), but because the\nvocal complementation between\nfront-men Hayden Thorpe and Tom\nFleming is so damn great. Anyway, it\ngoes without saying that Wild Beasts\nare much better than Miley Cyrus,\nand their most recent offering, Present\nTense, may be their best.\nFor those of you unfamiliar with\nWild Beats, they hail from humble\nKendal \u2013 home of those poignantly\ndisgusting mint cakes. As alluded\nto previously, their style revolves\naround the vocal partnership of\nThorpe and Fleming; Thorpe\u2019s tenor\npunches through intricate guitar\nriffs and brooding synth tones, with\nFleming\u2019s harmonies bridging the\nspace inbetween. The band started\nas a brilliantly flamboyant pop-rock\noutfit, and in succeeding albums have\ntransformed to serious art-rockers.\nSome of their critics, however, have\nfelt this has caused the fun to slowly\nbleed from Wild Beasts. I agree that\nperhaps they aren\u2019t the most exciting\nlive act, with some of my crueller\nfriends calling them \u201cMild Beasts\u201d,\nbut the music speaks for itself. Are\nRadiohead fun? Are The xx fun?\nIs music even supposed to be fun?\nAnd perhaps the band agrees: in\nWild Beasts - Present Tense\nWanderlust, the lead single of Present\nTense, Thorpe sings \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t confuse\nme with someone who gives a fuck\u201d.\nNo fucks given here.\nPresent Tense itself follows on from\n2011\u2019s Smother. To progress their\nsound the band worked in absence\nof their long-time producer Richard\nFormby and sought out to collaborate\nwith producers more experienced\nin electronic modes. This electronic\ncomponent is a distinct difference\nfrom previous albums, with a large\nintegration of synthesizers at the\nexpense of guitar-driven melodies.\nThis serves to add further texture to\nthe core of most tracks, helping to\nconvey despair when needed, as in\nDaughter, but also amplify beauty,\nas in the track New Life. Personally,\nI\u2019ve become pretty obsessed with\nWanderlust, a track that somewhat\nepitomizes the changes brought in for\nthis album. A dark punchy bass-line,\nan unrelentless drum loop, a choral-esque flickering synth, an outro that\nis as depressed as it is angry \u2013 it\u2019s a\npowerful track. As with Smother, I\nimagine most of the tracks will be\n\u2018growers\u2019, competing for my affection\nand attention.\nEmiel\u2019s Guide to\nEpisode 8 - From North to South\nClassical Music\nEmiel de Lange\nLast week we discussed Josquin, who\nis often known as the \u2018Beethoven of\nthe 16th Century, and in particular\nhis work Ave Maria. For many\ngenerations, Josquin was regarded by\ntheorists and other thinkers as the\ncomposer who had perfected the art\nof music. As Martin Luther wrote;\n\u201cHe is the master of the notes. They\nmust do as he wills; as for the other\ncomposers, they have to do as the\nnotes will\u201d. Josquin\u2019s use of imitation\n(different voices entering sequentially\nin a similar manner) and his synthesis\nof many different European styles\nwould be taken up by his students and\nby their students too. The most famous\nof these were Nicolas Gombert,\nJacob Clemens and Adrian Willaert,\nall \u2018Netherlandish\u2019 \u2013 Dutch speakers\nfrom present-day Belgium.\nWillaerts had a particularly strong\ninfluence on the future of music, and\nalthough his style is very similar to\nJosquin\u2019s \u2013 indeed when he went to\nRome he found the papal choir singing\nhis music under the mistaken belief\nthat it was Josquin\u2019s \u2013 he did make\nimportant contributions himself. His\nmusic was unprecedentedly smooth.\nDespite the many voices entering and\nexiting throughout a piece, the \u2018whole\u2019\nseems to have its own energy and\ncharacter; voices lost some of their\nindependence, and their significance\nis subsumed into the effect of this\n\u2018whole\u2019. What I mean by this is simply\nthat the old way of thinking of voices\nas \u2018lines\u2019 which enter into polyphony\nand move relative to each other is\nbeing replaced by a more \u2018horizontal\u2019\nview, where the harmonic relations\nbetween each voice at any moment\ncombine to give the music its character.\nFurthermore, Willaert gave his music\nnew continuity by avoiding cadences.\nCadences are the punctuation marks\nof music \u2013 the points at which a\ndissonant harmony resolves into a\nconsonance to give a sense of finality.\nWillaert didn\u2019t simply avoid these,\nbut cleverly prepared the listener for\nthem before moving the harmony\naway \u2013 creating surprise, suspense\nand energy. It is easy to see that in\npreparing the listener for a cadence,\nthe composer creates a context in\nwhich the cadence is expected, and\nthis too was a new, global way of\nthinking about harmonies within the\ncontext of others \u2013 a step on the way\nto our modern system of \u2018 keys\u2019.\nOne of Willaert\u2019s pupils became the\nmost influential theorist of the day.\nThe Italian, Gioseffo Zarlino, wrote\nwidely on many aspects of music and\nsought to characterise the Ars Perfecta\nexemplified in the music of his master\nand his predecessors. In doing so\nhe formally recognised some of the\nrecent innovations and made them\nknown to composers throughout\nEurope. The most significant of these\nmay be the \u2018triad\u2019 \u2013 a harmonic\nstructure which is still dominant\ntoday. Whereas previously harmonies\nwere characterised by the intervals\npresent between voices, Zarlino\nrecognised in the music of Willaert\net al. a grouping of notes which acted\nas a functional unit. Composers often\nused a particularly pleasant stacking\nof notes which included the usual\nperfect consonants (the 5th octave),\nbut also the interval of a 3rd. We now\nknow that this stacking corresponds\nto the harmonic series of frequencies\nheard when a pitch is played but\nZarlino attempted to justify it using\nsome bizarre mathematics and called\nit the triad. Nowadays when we refer\nto a chord, such as C Major, we are\nreferring to the triad built on C, which\nalso includes the notes E and G.\nZarlino succeeded Willaert as the\nmaestro di cappelle at St. Marks\nCathedral in Venice. Here, Willaert\nhad created a leading centre of music\nand invited colleagues from all over\nEurope to come work.\nVenice became the centre of\nthe musical world as wealthy\nmerchants imported musical talent\nfrom the North and eventually the\nNetherlandish innovation would give\nway to Italian dominance.\nLee Sewell\nMusic Writer\nCloud Nothings - Here and Nowhere Else\nStuart Masson\nMusic Editor\nI\nt has been an unusual journey\nfor Dylan Baldi, the man\nbehind Cleveland based Cloud\nNothings. He was signed as\na one-man band and released\nhis first two albums, Turned On and\nthe self-titled Cloud Nothings, were\nrecorded as such. They were full of lo-fi noise pop at its most frantic and fun,\nwith catchy hooks oozing out of every\nsong. They fitted seamlessly, although\nwith little fanfare, into the lo-fi indie\nscene of the time. It was The Pains\nof Being Pure at Heart running\nlate for a dentist appointment, Titus\nAndronicus after a Disney film or\nWavves if they\u2019d never seen any real\nwaves. They were good, but they\nweren\u2019t the most necessary of bands.\nIn 2012, Cloud Nothings recorded\nAttack on Memory. It was the first\nrecorded with the live line-up and\nwas widely heralded at the time for\nbeing the dreaded \u201cmassive direction\nchange\u201d. As someone who was a big\nfan of their early stuff, I approached\nit with a fairly closed mind. I was\nexpecting it to be shit, but I was so\nwrong. They may have abandoned\ntheir noise pop roots. Sounding more\nlike At the Drive-In, Unwound and\nFugazi than Best Coast, and the lo-fi production completely absent, it\nwas certainly a big switch up. It was\na switch up that changed them from\nobscure also-rans into one of the\nmost important bands in modern\nindie rock. Mixing the catchy hooks\nwith post-hardcore, grunge and a new\nfound sense of disillusionment, it was\none of the albums of 2012.\nHere and Nowhere Else is not a\nmassive direction change. Despite\nlosing the extra guitarist, the sound\nremains pretty similar. There\u2019s still\ncatchy hooks, there\u2019s still strong\npost-hardcore and grunge influences,\nthere\u2019s still a furious sense of urgency.\nIt might not be innovative, but it\u2019s still\nreally fucking good.\nOpening track, Now Here In, is an\nabsolute beast that would have fitted\nin perfectly on Attack on Memory.\nCatchy riffs are matched with Dylan\u2019s\nlaid back drawl, slowly building up to\nan explosive solo and a big singalong\nfinale. Giving Into Seeing draws a lot\nfrom Sonic Youth, with repeated\nscreams of \u201cswallow\u201d matched with\na haunting dissonant guitar that just\nkeeps rising. It\u2019s absolutely brilliant.\nAll bands should sound like Sonic\nYouth. No Thoughts is Cloud Nothings\nat their most intense, whilst closer I\u2019m\nNot Part of Me features some of his\ncatchiest work allied with some of his\nbest ever lyrics. Baldi\u2019s always been\na big fan of repeating a single line\nand \u201cI\u2019m not telling you all I\u2019m going\nthrough\u201d is definitely one of his best\nrefrains.\nThe highlight of Attack on Memory\nwas the nine minute long Wasted\nDays. Bravely featuring second on the\nalbum it remains an absolute tune.\nThey seem to have gone with a similar\nidea of having one long track here,\nthe seven and a half minute Pattern\nWalks is a bit more traditionally\npositioned as the penultimate track.\nIt certainly doesn\u2019t have the same\nimpact that Wasted Days did, but it\u2019s\nstill pretty good. It follows a similar\npattern of catchy section followed\nby instrumental section followed by\nanother catchy bit, but it\u2019s just not at\nthe same level.\nThe highlight here is Psychic\nTrauma. A slowed down first verse\nis pleasant enough, but it\u2019s the\nsudden tempo change that makes\nit. Everything gets faster, louder and\nmore intense. It doesn\u2019t let up, it just\nkeeps getting better.\nCloud Nothings seem to have\nsettled on this sound, but that\u2019s for the\nbest. As much as I enjoy the old stuff,\nthis is better. Loads better. Attack on\nMemory was one of the best indie rock\nalbum of the last five years or so, and\nthis one\u2019s definitely the best of this year\nso far. It\u2019s perfect shout-along-at-a-gig\ntype stuff, but there\u2019s a lot of musical\nsubstance if you want to dig deeper.\nThis is a highly rewarding listen, and\nit comes with a high recommendation\nfrom me, if perhaps a slightly less high\none than Attack on Memory...\nNetherlandish composer, Adrian Willaert\nMusic theorist, Gioseffo Zarlino\n\n"

From the ashes of\nthe once booming tourist area, rose\nthe phoenix of Imperial Pool first\u2019s\nseason, with an exceptional mid-Feb-ruary display.\nPreparation for the tournament had\nbeen far from ideal, with eleven players pulling out of the running within a\nweek of the opening Thursday and the\nresulting loss of the second team halving the club\u2019s chances of promotion.\nWorse still, Tomek \u2018the aTomek bomb\u2019\nSzymaniec and Cheng \u2018so good they\nnamed him twice\u2019 Cheng looked set to\nmiss their individual ties having been\ndelayed by coursework assignments.\nThings were looking bleak as club\npresident Max \u2018Chalm down dear\u2019\nChalmers, took on Connor \u2018the postman\u2019 in his first individual match, but\na quick look at the drawsheet by Ben\n\u2018not Sean Dyche\u2019 Harvey revealed that\nboth Tomek and Cheng would make\ntheir (fortuitously) late matches. This\nallowed Max, who with this tournament became the most capped pool\nplayer in the club\u2019s history (since records began), to concentrate on what\nturned out to be an excellent game of\npool.\n\u2018The postman\u2019 was a classy operator\nbut like a dog in the front yard Max\nmade his work extremely difficult\nwith great tactical play and streetwise pool. This, however, was a very\ntough draw for Max (as always seems\nto be the case) and eventually he succumbed 3-1, with the postman deliv-ering.\nIt was decided that going out might\nbe a good idea and the team gorged\nthemselves on fish and chips in preparation for their upcoming fixtures.\nTomek finally arrived at the holiday\npark at 5:55pm, and calmly strode\noff to play his match as the team dispersed to their respective tables. By\n6:15 both Cheng and Rob \u2018the Bank\u2019\nHughes were out, with Rob having\nplayed mature student Mike Giles\nand been obliterated and Cheng suffering a similar 3-0 defeat. Everyone\nconverged to watch Ben take on an\nOxford undergrad with a striking resemblance to Jesus in a final frame\nwhich was painful to watch. Ben had\nbeen put in an impossible situation\nand after a series of excellent attempts\nto escape from it, lost.\nIt was at this point that Tomek happened to mention that he had won\nhis match and was through to the\nnext round. The newcomer was up\nagain that evening and just kept on\nwinning, with a beautiful 3-2 performance against Lorne McConnachie\nof Abertay. Make no mistake, his\nopponent could play, but Tomek responded to everything thrown at him,\nwith a stunning double to wrap up the\nfirst frame particularly sticking in the\nmemory (similarly memorable was his\nopponent\u2019s face after it). Next to feel\nthe sting of Tomek\u2019s cueing was an unsuspecting lad from the University of\nHertfordshire\u2019s recently formed pool\nclub, with a comfortable 4-1 win capping a great three hours\u2019 work for the\n\u2018aTomek bomb\u2019. His reward was a last\n64 match against the 9th seed James\nBrill on the Friday afternoon.\nThat evening, the team slept about as\nwell was as possible in sub-zero conditions and everyone was well rested\nand ready for the next day\u2019s play. You\nwouldn\u2019t know that, however from\nthe first team shield match though,\nwith Warwick 3 running out 6-1 winners (predictably Tomek won the one\nframe) with no one really on their\ngame. At this point the team were\nsomewhat despondent, unaware of\nthat fact that they had just played the\nbest team in the group.\nThe resulting malaise followed the\nteam into their next match until, when\n3-1 down, Nottingham Trent 2nd\u2019s\ncaptain frantically called over the\norganisers to look at Cheng\u2019s shoes.\nBlack shoes were a requirement for\nthe tournament and Cheng\u2019s were\nunfortunately a very dark brown. Despite having potted the black to win\nthe frame Imperial were docked it and\ntold that they must provide Cheng\nwith black shoes.\nThe final score was 6-4 to Imperial,\neven with the team having to constantly swap footwear.\nThe team matches were over for another day and the squad assembled to\nwatch Tomek play his last 64 match.\nHe played fearlessly in the face of an\nopponent who was, as his name sug-gested, brilliant and even won the\nfirst frame to put him on the ropes.\nBut James Brill wasn\u2019t the 9th seed for\nno reason and responded with some\ngreat pool to win 4-1. Tomek could be\nvery proud of his debut performance\nand gave an excellent player a lot of\nproblems.\nThe Imperial five then decided to\nwind down by taking part in the evening speed pool team tournament, a\nversion of the game with essentially\nno rules. The aim was to start from\nthe break and pot every ball on the table as fast as possible, with each team\nmember starting when the previous\none finished. The first team to have\nall their players clear up won. The atmosphere at the event was something\nakin to that of a football match, with\nStrathclyde and Nottingham Trent in\nparticular making it very lively and\npushing the boundaries of the dress\n(or lack thereof) code. Imperial, having never played this form of the game\nbefore, were out in the first round, but\nplan to practise this great form of the\ngame for next year\u2019s event.\nSaturday was Imperial\u2019s busiest day\nin the team shield tournament with\nthree group matches to play and more\nto follow if they finished 2nd or high-er. First up were Strathclyde 2, who\nhad one or two dangerous players in\ntheir ranks. A shaky start saw ImpeImperial Cross Country\nproduce Strong\nPerformance at the\nHyde Park Relays\nChris Bannon gives his account\nOn 15 February, 2014, over 120 runners lined up alongside the Serpentine\nto start the 66th Hyde Park Relays,\nwith each men\u2019s/mixed or women\u2019s\nteam comprising of six and four members completing laps of roughly 5km\nand 3km respectively. In total over\n600 people were warming up ready to\ncomplete their lap meaning the start/\nfinish line was a hive of activity.\nThe men\u2019s and mixed race went off\nat 2pm followed quickly by the women\u2019s field five minutes later. Just before\nquarter past the lead group sprinted\ntheir way down the finishing funnel\nto pass over to their second runners.\nLeading the men\u2019s pack home on the\nfirst leg was club captain Chris Bannon with a blistering time of 14:55,\nthis proved to be the fastest leg of the\nday by over 10 seconds. He handed\nover to new club member Gil Machado who started his lap with a near 45\nsecond lead.\nMeanwhile Imo Simmonds brought\nthe women\u2019s A team home in amongst\nthe leaders with the fastest IC time of\nthe day on women\u2019s course in 11:24.\nShe passed the metaphorical baton\nonto Sophie Kirk who 12:48 later\npassed over to Antoinette Hardijzer;\nwho set off on her A team debut (she\nwould later run another two laps for\nother teams).\nMeanwhile, in the men\u2019s race ultramarathon specialist James Ellis lead\nthe race out on the third leg before\nlosing two places in a slight detour before bringing the team home in third\nplace to hand over to Matt Douthwaite, who continued a strong run of\nform to break 17mins for the lap.\nFurther back in the field, William\nJones was roughly 15km through his\nsolo \u2018Milan\u2019 effort to complete all six\nlaps (30km) of the men\u2019s course by\nhimself. Alongside him the ICXC Boiz\nteam were steadily picking their way\nthrough the field whilst some of their\nteam were simultaneously recovering\nfrom a night out the evening before.\nThe other women\u2019s IC teams were\nalso lapping well with strong runs\nfrom social secretary Isobel Holding,\ntriathletes Sian Morgan and Vicki Solly as well as new club member Lucinda\nSmart all breaking 14 minutes, showing good speed in preparation for the\nupcoming Silverstone Half Marathon.\nIn the last few legs the front few\nteams held their positions with Faron\nHesse putting in a superb 15:42 lap\nbefore handing over to Liam Smith\nwho led the men\u2019s A team home with\na 16:22 lap to 3rd overall in a time of\n1:36:39 (and 2nd university team)\nclosely behind 1st place Oxford University A (1:35:25) and external team\nGuac \u2018n\u2019 Rollers (1:36:06).\nThe women\u2019s A team finished\nstrongly with Kimberly Mason running the anchor leg in a time of 12:38\nracing right to the line to give a total time of 50:10 and 9th place in a\nstrong field led by Oxford A and B\nteams (1st in 45:01 & 2nd in 46:16)\nfollowed in 3rd by Bristol in 46:06.\nThe fastest legs of the day went\nto Kate Niehas (10:42), Hannah\nKitchen (10:48) and Sarah McCuaig\n(11:06) in the women\u2019s race with\nChristopher Bannon (14:55), Glen\nWatts (15:08) and Alex Muir (15:23)\ntaking the fastest legs in the men\u2019s\nrace.\nAs the day progressed, many more\nrunners from universities across\nEurope, and from departments and\nhalls within Imperial finished the\ncourse. William Jones finished his\nsix legs in a total time of 2:04:06\naveraging just under 21minutes for\neach 5km lap whilst finishing well\ninto the top half and beating many\nuniversity teams in the process! Xenia Hall led home the internal halls\ncompetition by nearly 5minutes,\nabsolutely demolishing strong competition from Fisher, Beit, Wilkinson\n& Weeks and Southwell & Bernard\nSunley. Following the end of the\nrace, it was time for the celebrations\nto begin, with food and prize giving\nin the SCR leading onto an after party in the union with the other uni-versities. I would say more but there\nseems to be group amnesia about the\nexact events of the night, potentially\nbecause everyone was so tired from\nracing; or maybe due to the gratuitous amounts of J\u00e4ger consumed and\nthe boat racing! The next morning\nthere was the obligatory hangover\nbreakfast for those who slept over\nfollowed by long runs and a return\nto training or coursework for many\nwithin the club.\nSpecial thanks must be given to all\nwho helped out on the day: setting\nup, marshalling and taking down\nthe course; timing and organising\nthe results; preparing and serving\nthe food; and sleeping at the union\nto host the other universities. This\nevent wouldn\u2019t have been possible\nwithout the three organisers: Johnny\nLi, Oliver Ashe, and Milan Misak,\nwith the guidance and help of captain Chris Bannon and club secretary Matt Douthwaite.\nrial briefly behind in this match, but\nStrathcylde\u2019s loudness seemed to put\ntheir own players off more than ours\nand Imperial ran out 6-4 winners (al-though it should have been more).\nThe big London derby followed, with\nUCL 1 the pre-tournament favourites\nto take the group. They were, how-ever, destroyed 6-1, with Max twice\nproducing exceptional dishes and\nboth Tomek and Ben winning both\ntheir frames. Disgruntled, their team\ncaptain mumbled something about\nhaving to arrange a \u2018friendly\u2019 to get\nrevenge before the end of term, something which the team agreed they\nwould look forward to.\nThat meant that, going into the final\ngame against group whipping boys\nSalford 2nds, Imperial were guaranteed to progress with one more victo-ry. To everyone\u2019s surprise, the Salford\nplayers most of all, Imperial went 2-1\nbehind early on, with Rob missing the\nchance to win an easy frame and others losing unluckily. The remainder,\nhowever, of the frames went to Imperial, with Rob atoning for his earlier\nframe loss with the finish of his life to\nsecure a 6-2 victory.\nDue to several hold ups in play, Imperial went straight from the final group\ngame into their first knockout match,\nwhich was against Salford\u2019s first team.\nThis was the tightest match of the\ntournament, with some nice play all\nround and Tomek dazzling on the big\nstage again. After a great match, Imperial were 5-4 up going into the last\nframe.\nCheng was playing Salford\u2019s number\nfive in a horrendously tactical frame,\nwhich neither player was enjoying.\nShot after shot saw the frame get more\nand more difficult for both players until at one point it became impossible\nfor Cheng. He clipped his opponent\u2019s\nball, but the Salford man didn\u2019t seem\nto notice. A cry of foul came from the\ncrowd (with coaching being against\nthe rules!) and the referee was called\nover. Cheng\u2019s opponent now claimed\nto have spotted the foul all along and\nwas allowed two shots, with which he\nfinished the frame.\nWith the result being a draw, it went\nto a three frame shoot-off between\neach team\u2019s three best players. Max,\nBen and Tomek were put forward,\nwith Salford\u2019s three all very able play-ers. Max was given one very difficult\nchance in his frame before losing and\nTomek played some excellent pool to\ntake his frame to the black. A wonderful double from the Salford man\nsealed Imperial\u2019s fate.\nOverall the group can be immensely\nproud of its achievements over the\nfour day event, with several firsts for\nan Imperial team and plenty of reasons to be optimistic for the future.\nFour of the five team members will\nreturn next year and two were only\nin their freshman year. This is a team\nwhich can, and will, improve for next\nyear and will stand a good chance of\npromotion by the time next February rolls in. More importantly, we\nthrashed UCL.\n\n"

The\nDevils\u2019 penalty kill was set to work\nand was impressive throughout the\ngame, valiantly denying the Yetis any\npowerplay goals throughout the game\nincluding a five on three advantage for\nUCL at one point during the third pe-riod.\nThe Devils opened the scoring only\nmoments later when Ryan Ritchie\nlatched onto a pass from Max Fink\nand leathered a shot past the hapless\nYeti keeper. The Yetis were looking for\nan immediate response and the Devils found themselves under siege with\ngoalie Stefan Nubert making several\nexceptional saves to keep the Devils in\nfront. The Yetis did find their equal-iser after picking up a rebound but the\nDevils responded in kind only a minute later with Ryan Heaton picking up\na long pass and slotting home on the\nbreakaway, giving the Devils a 2-1 lead\nafter the first period.\nAfter a cagey start to the second pe-riod, the Yetis restored parity as their\nstar defenceman managed to find an\nextra gear and slip past a few checks\nto score. Tensions were notched up a\nscale as neither side wanted to give up\nany opportunities and several big hits\nfrom both sides riled up both teams.\nThis culminated with the UCL Yetis\ncaptain challenging Ryan Ritchie to a\nfight, which was quickly settled with a\nsingle jab to the nose (check it out on\nYoutube!) sending the UCL player hitting the ice faster than Tim Runcorn\ncan strawpedo beers at the AGM.\nPushing to score late in the second\nperiod with a man advantage, an unfortunate break allowed the Yetis to\ncapitalise and come into the final period with a 2-3 lead.\nUCL quickly found themselves a\nman down after a Yetis player retaliated after being on the receiving end\nof a hit from Angus Coleman. The undisciplined Yetis were made to pay after Ryan Heaton banked in a rebound\non the powerplay. With the Devils\ngarnering momentum, the Yetis could\nonly attempt to halt the constant\nwaves of attack by illegally taking out\nDevils players. The Devils cashed in\non the powerplay once again to take\nthe lead as Ryan Heaton completed\nINSIDE\nAll you need for Varsity Day in our pull-out\nIC ICE HOCKEY\nIC stroll past LSE\nIt was a typically busy\nSaturday morning at South\nKensington station as the 4th\nteam gathered for their journey\nto #FortressBerrylands, eager to\nprove their worth against top-of-the-league LSE 4s. In one of\nthe tightest LUSL Division 2 title\nraces seen in decades \u2013 only two\npoints separated the top 4 \u2013 this\nwas a must win for both teams\nconcerned. But it was particularly\nimportant for us, since we had\nplayed at least a game more\nthan our main rivals, LSE 4s and\nLSE 2s (no offence QM 2s). Our\nplight wasn\u2019t helped by a certain\nFrenchman, Sofiane Hamadi, who\ndecided to arrive 30 minutes late\nto the station, eating into precious\nwarm up/banana consumption\ntime. Despite this fashionably late\nattitude from Sofiane he would\nlater repay his debts by scoring a\nfantastic early goal. After being\nslipped in by the on-form Fogo\n\u2018The Enigma\u2019 Adelowo with a\nsumptuous through ball behind\ntheir bewildered left back, Sofiane\ntook one touch out of his feet before\nsweeping the ball emphatically into\nthe bottom left corner. 1-0 IC 4s.\nDespite our strong start, some\nnerves kicked in and the league\nleaders inevitably responded from\ntheir sluggish opening. Our faith in\nthe world renowned ICUAFC tiki-taka style was coming back to bite\nus as the sticky Berrylands pitch\nand a couple of sloppy touches led\nto losing possession in dangerous\nareas and conceding silly fouls. A\ndevilish delivery from a set piece\nled to an equaliser being bundled\nin by their 6\u20196+ centre half. 1-1.\nThe momentum appeared to\nhave shifted in the game. But\na scintillating breakaway only\nminutes after the equaliser, led\nby Canadian import Daniel\nGregory\u2019s perfectly timed over\nthe top through ball (LB+Y) to\nAlex Craving-Dale, who broke the\nopposition\u2019s frankly appalling and\nill-judged offside trap to be clean\nthrough. Craving-Dale flicked the\nball over the keeper and casually\nside-footed it into the back of the\nnet.\nOur front four continued to\nuse their pace and intelligence to\ncause plenty of problems to the\nLSE backline, who resorted to dirty\ntactics such as blasting the ball\ninto Gregory\u2019s stomach, winding\nhim badly. In fact it was only a few\nminutes after his winding that the\nirrepressible Gregory managed to\nscore our third to put us 3-1 up.\nConfidence was high and after\nsome intricate play in the midfield\nHenry Garner\nICUAFC\nCraving-Dale was released down\nthe flank, Gregory struck it with\nhis weaker right foot on the volley,\nproducing a stunning Van Bastenesque shot into the top right corner.\n3-1, three quality goals. We went\ninto half time on a high.\nThe second half produced a less\nfrantic opening but exchanges were\nstill tense. The next goal was all-important and both teams knew it.\nWe continued to create openings\nand the ball somehow managed to\nnot go in after a point blank header\nfrom Adelowo was saved on the line\nby their keeper. Despite many fierce\nclaims that it had indeed crossed\nthe line, Fogo was unable to add to\nhis 19 goal tally. Vicious rumours\nare that Fogo is planning to write a\nletter to BUCS demanding goal-line\ntechnology be implemented into\nevery game, such is his thirst for\nfantasy points.\nThe key goal finally came after\nan inspired double substitution\nby yours truly, bringing on Josh\nParsi and Josep Mel\u00e9 for the last\n15 minutes. The fresh legs made an\nimmediate impact, as Josh lofted the\nball towards Josep, who cushioned\nthe ball with his instep before\nlooping an acrobatic volley into the\ntop corner. Game over.\nCraving-Dale added one more to\nhis tally, assisted by Josep, to put the\ngame truly to bed. To their credit,\nthey fought to the end and had a late\npenalty appeal turned down. Other\nthan that, the game turned into more\nof a training match. Sam \u2018Edin Dzeko\u2019\nDuffield went on a mesmerising\nrun down the left wing, beating\n(according to him) 12 players before\nselflessly cutting the ball back but to\nno avail. Even I made my own burst\nfrom centre back, getting on the end\nof a Dale cross only to head just over.\nIt could have been eight or nine, but\nwe had to settle for five as the final\nwhistle went. Only two more to go in\nour charge for promotion.\nINSIDE: Imperial 1st XI thump\nUCL\nICUAFC is sponsored by:\nhis hat-trick after creating space with\nsome nifty stick handling moves. With\nthe game seemingly reaching its con-clusion, agonisingly the Yetis mustered a response with 2 minutes left\nto take the game into overtime. Both\nsides exchanged chances but with no\nbreakthrough, the game was to be decided in a shootout. Ryan Heaton converted to give the Devils the advantage\nonly for the Yetis player to even the\nstakes with a slapshot. After two more\nattempts, Max Fink pulled an incredible move, sending the Yeti keeper to\nthe ice with a fake shot before slotting\nin an open net. Stefan Nubert then cemented his credentials as man of the\nmatch as he stoned the Yeti shooter\nto crown Imperial as the London Ice\nVarsity 2014 champions.\nIf you missed out on the London Ice\nVarsity you can see the mighty Imperial Devils take on the Kent Knights\nin their penultimate game of the season on Saturday 8th March.

    "content": "54 FRIDAY 07 MAR\nCLUBS & SOCS Editor: Nida Mahmud\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nCheck(mate) your Privilege\nI\nt\u2019s one thing to write a review\nfor an Imperial College student\nproduction. It\u2019s another thing to\nwrite a review for such a show\nyou\u2019ve personally been involved\nin for two years (both in acting and\nproduction) - and therefore already\nknow the good/bad/ugly that comes\nwith it. You find your pride and\nbias as an insider/alumnus of said\nproduction (\u201coh it was amazing and\nwe could do no wrong!\u201d) grapples with\nyour professional view as a neutral\noutsider with prior external stage\nexperience. Still, that was the situation\nI willingly put myself in when I made\na snap decision to attend Malaysian\nSociety\u2019s MNight this year - this\ntime as an audience member with no\ninvolvement.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen the infamously-vandalized poster located in the 4th\nfloor of Central Library that\u2019s made\nthe rounds on Facebook, ICU MNight\nis an annual 2-day production that\ntakes place in the Great Hall. It\u2019s a\nshowcase of Malaysian culture and\nquirks wrapped up in an acting and\ndancing extravaganza, with tickets\nfor both nights selling out. This year\u2019s\nproduction was titled Checkmate,\ndirected by Pashiini Supramaniam\nand Shi Kai Wei whilst being produced\nby Wee Kii Teh and En Lin Goh.\nI took my seat in the packed hall\nminutes before the emcees - Clayton\nQwah and Jia Sheng Lee (two of my\nfellow MNight 2012 alumni!) - made\ntheir entrance. With light-hearted\nhumor and a good dose of cringe-yet-clever punnery, the duo set the\nstage(ha!) for the rest of the show,\nbringing audience energy levels up.\nThey then made way for a spectacular\nopening dance filled with stunning\nshadow imagery, which started\nthe show with a bang - whilst also\nintroducing the plot and depicting\nsome key characters.\nThe play revolves around a decade-long conflict between two fictional\ncountries, Bolehland (pronounced\nbo-lay-h-land) and Kiasuland (kee-ah-soo-land) - a reference to the\nfriendlier \u201crivalry\u201d between Malaysia\nand neighbouring Singapore. With\nboth countries\u2019 royal families\nhaving suffered casualties in the\nwar, a temporary truce is called. The\nBolehland princes - Fitzgerald (Jae\nHann Lim) and Edward (Edward Tan)\n- travel to meet the newly-coronated\nKiasuland king, the hilariously quirky\nRajaKingthik(KharthikChakravarthy)\nand his bubbly yet unrefined niece\nPrincess Seraphina (Sharon Fu) for\npeace treaty negotiations.\nOpposing idealogies between the\nprincely siblings - cynical elder Fitz\nbelieves in war, younger naive Ed lives\nby diplomatic negotiation - served\nas a constant source of tension that\nunderpinned the whole play, with\nhidden assassination agendas from\ntheir father (the duplicitous King\nKang Kung, played by Wei Jian Tan)\nthreatening to rear their ugly head.\nDuring their visit, Prince Fitz and\nPrincess Seraphina fall for each other,\nrendering the prince torn between his\nideals of a hostile Kiasuland takeover\nand his desire to keep the princess\nhappy. Drama rollercoaster all around,\nwe say!\nDespite the somber theme, the\nshow was a barrel of laughs - just\nthe way MNight traditionally is. It\ncertainly wouldn\u2019t be an ICU MSoc\nproduction without the customary\npolitical jibes, inclusion of Manglish\n(Malaysian pidgin/slang) or pop\nculture references, and this year\ndidn\u2019t disappoint. Cheeky homages\nwere paid to prior Malaysian political\ngaffes (like the Sharifah Jahbeen\n\u201cListen Listen Listen\u201d debacle) and\nneighbouring Singapore\u2019s quirks, plus\nan unexpected Doge reference had\neveryone in stitches. With a great mix\nof slapstick humor and cleverly subtle\ndouble entendres (like a noteworthy\n\u201cgun-polishing\u201d moment between Fitz\nand Ed), the audience\u2019s funny bones\ngot their fair share of attention.\nThe whole cast\u2019s acting was highly\nnatural and a delight to watch, though\nspecial mention has to be given to the\nprinces\u2019 assistants - Kieran (Dustin\nChung) and Lyra (Sonali Nardkani.)\nThese supporting characters served as\neffective comic relief and the perfect\nfoils to the more-serious characters in\nthe plot, with stellar slapstick-acting\nthat stole the show. The Narrator\n(Wui Shen Ng) also deserves kudos\nfor his clear, perfect diction and\nhighly expressive \u201cradio-friendly\u201d\nvoice throughout the play - even if we\ndidn\u2019t see him acting onstage until his\nmonologue at the very end.\nScene transitions involved a wide\nvariety of cultural dances, ranging\nfrom Broadway to hip-hop to even\nChinese Lion dance and traditional\nSilat (Malay martial arts.) The\nchoreography was top notch, with\nflawless execution from the dancers.\nAt one point during the post-intermission Dikir Barat (a traditional\nMalay musical dance form), the\naudience got to enjoy a parody of\nBlurred Lines, where the lyrics\nincluded some cheeky bashing of\nrival universities - much to everyone\u2019s\ndelight, non-Imperialites included.\nThe music team provided the perfect\ncherry on top; live instrumentals\npeppered throughout the play ably\nemphasized the relevant moods.\nAt the end, with the two kings having\nbeen assassinated, the deceptively-sanguine (now Queen) Seraphina was\nrevealed to have masterminded the\ndeaths. This disturbing penny-drop\nmoment came with the revelation that\nshe had struggled for ages knowing\nthat Kingthik had killed her war-loving father, and was merely fighting\nfor the same ideals (two united\ncountries) as the princes - giving the\naudience a chance to empathize with\nher actions. In a cruel twist of fate\nboth lovers ended up dead - one at\nthe hands of the other, denying the\naudience a happy ending and leaving\nthem shell-shocked.\nGiven the nature of such a\nproduction - where most of the cast\n(all freshers!) and crew have minimal\n(or even no) stage experience, there\nwere a few snags to be expected.\nSome scene changes were not as fluid\nand snappy as hoped, and there were\ncertain times where the acting was\nslightly contrived, or the pacing felt\nrather draggy.\nDespite that, it was fabulous overall.\nImperial\u2019s MNight is unique in that\nit also has to cater to more non-Malaysians than other MNights in\nthe country (it\u2019s 2 nights as opposed\nto just 1.) It\u2019s not an easy task given\nthe cultural differences; Malaysians\ntend to approach/appreciate stage\nproductions very differently to\nthe British - but the cast and crew\nmanaged, taking care of both fellow\ncountrymen and the non-Malaysians\nvery well in the process. As an MNight\nalumnus, I was proud of what the\nyounger generation pulled off that\nnight, and how hard they worked\nfor it. As that uninvolved audience\nmember? I\u2019ll quote what Princess/\nQueen Seraphina herself said: \u201cWow,\nmuch deep. So amaze.\u201d\nCarol Ann Cheah revisits Malaysian Night - now as a non-performing/producing outsider\nDANIEL SAW/ MALAYSIAN SOCIETY\nA Scene from the Opening Shadow Dance\nDANIEL SAW/ MALAYSIAN SOCIETY DANIEL SAW/ MALAYSIAN SOCIETY DANIEL SAW/ MALAYSIAN SOCIETY\nChubby Bunny - Chess edition\n\n"

My past\ncommitments have given me insight into the structure,\nthe strengths and weaknesses of the GSU and also\nthe changes which can be made to improve the\npostgraduate quality, which will certainly be of benefit\nas GSU president.\nIn particular, as a president of the GSU I will work to:\n-Empower postgraduate students; I will make sure\nyour voices are heard at all levels across the college to\nensure the quality of all postgraduate-facing services.\n-Develop more effective representation system and\nfeedback mechanism among postgraduates so that all\npostgraduates can affect the college decisions about\ntheir studies.\n-Improve your welfare quality by coordinating various\nnumbers of social events for postgraduates (research\ndoes not mean to be always in the lab or behind your\ncomputer).\n-Facilitate postgraduates\u2019 tuition fees payment (I know\ntuition fees are sometimes very frustrating)\nI\u2019m looking forward to work with all of you to get the\nbest out of our postgraduate life at Imperial College.\nHassan\nAhmadzadeh\nGSU\nPresudent\nRCSU President\nRCSU\nPresident\nAlberto\nPerez Robledo\nBenjamin\nFernando\nNo manifesto supplied\nHi!

Not one of the events\nI\u2019ve ever run (the craziest of which was my attempt\nto climb 5,554m up Mount Everest) has ever been a\nfailure.\nAs Union Council Rep I\u2019ve pushed hard on issues\nthat matter to you as RCSU students, like scrapping\nentrance fees to Sports Nights. In my two years as Year\nRep in Physics I\u2019ve worked with the department to\nimplement a fairer exam system with more consistent\nfeedback.\nAs RCSU president, I will make sure that we keep\nup our reputation for brilliant events: increasing\nthe capacity of our Balls whilst also having events\nthroughout the year to cater to those who don\u2019t like to\ndrink.\nWith regard to representation and welfare, we\nneed to strengthen our academic support network.\nWe will work with our DepSocs to improve the\nWiki note-sharing facilities, whilst also improving\nthe Mums&Dads scheme and working with our\ndepartments to make the Personal Tutor system more\neffective, with specific emphasis on mental health\nsupport.\nIn a nutshell, I think the RCSU needs to reach out to\nits students more and stand up for us when we need it\nto.\n\n"

The Dogecoin, which\nwas first introduced three months\nago and is inspired by the popular\nDoge meme, is one of a number of\ncryptocurrencies set up following the\nspectacular success of Bitcoin. Such\ncryptocurrencies are not controlled\nby a central bank but rather by a predetermined algorithm. Individuals\ncan donate some of their computer\u2019s\nprocessor time to running this\nalgorithm and managing transactions\nperformed using these currencies.\nThey are rewarded for this by being\nawarded newly generated coins of that\ncurrency \u2013 this process is referred to\nas mining and is the only way in which\nnew Dogecoins and Bitcoins can be\nproduced.\nWorking late at night, the student\nwas able to use ordinary desktop\nterminals to mine the Dogecoins.\nHe follows the example of a Harvard\nStudent who used their University\u2019s\nresearch supercomputer for\nDogecoin mining. The currency\nhas been growing in both value and\npopularity \u2013 most notably having\nbeen used to fundraise the money\nto send the Jamaican bobsled team\nto the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.\nHowever Dogecoins are not yet worth\nanywhere near as much as Bitcoins \u2013\nthe student\u2019s efforts have only earned\nhim the equivalent of \u00a320.\nSpeaking to CoinDesk reporter and\nformer Felix editor Kadhim Shubber\nearlier this week the anonymous\nstudent said that he decided to\nuse College computers rather than\nbuying a powerful computer because\nhe doesn\u2019t \u201cfind the cryptocurrency\nmarket stable enough to make real\ninvestments, at least for now, on a\nstudent budget\u201d. He added that: \u201cI\u2019ve\nnot had a single issue yet, so I\u2019ve kept\nscaling up! It seems they don\u2019t have\nanything set up to bring attention to\nthe fact I\u2019m maxing out the CPUs,\nwhich is nice\u201d.\nHowever,byTuesdaytheschemewas\ndiscovered by College ICT, resulting\nin the student being permanently\nbanned from using the College\u2019s more\npowerful research supercomputers. In\na statement to The Tab Imperial, the\nCollege said: \u201cUse of the College\u2019s IT\nfacilities for commercial purposes is\nnot permitted without authorisation.\nImperial investigates and takes\nappropriate action against instances\nof misuse, in line with information\npolicies. Occasional personal use of\nCollege machines is permitted where\nuse does not disrupt the conduct of\nCollege business or other users.\u201d\nChess Team wins at\nBUCA\nTwo weekends ago, Imperial College\nLondon\u2019s chess club fielded three\nteams for the British University Chess\nAssociation championship (BUCA),\ncoming away with two cases of\nsilverware.\nThe first team competed in the\nopen competition, where the real\ntitle of British Chess Champion\nwas competed. Captained by James\nHookham, and including Alex\nGalliano, Veronica Foisor as well as\nChess President Arijit Gupta \u00ac\u2013 the\nteam that had been seeded first \u2013\nwas expected to retain the title that\nthey had won last year. However,\nseveral hurdles stood in the way of\nImperial\u2019s success. Over ten teams\nwere competing, including formidable\nfoes in Cambridge 1 and Edinburgh.\nHowever, after playing five rounds,\nall the worries of Imperial\u2019s first\nteam were proven to be completely\nunfounded, as a clean sheet of five wins\nwere secured leaving the Imperialites\nwith ten points out of a possible ten,\nand thus confirming them as British\nChess Champions for the second year\nrunning.\nThe Plate competition, which\nincluded Imperial\u2019s second and third\nteams, was much less clear-cut. The\nsecond team, seeded first in this\ncompetition, consisted of first board\nWan Mohd Fahzli, second board Boey\nJin Huey, third board Shih Goh and\nfourth board, captain Luke Barron.\nThroughout the first few rounds, they\nrouted their opponents, however a\ndraw against main title contenders\nBirmingham did not bode well for\nthe rest of the competition. However\neven after that setback, they team\nbounced back all the way to the\nlast game, which seemed have been\nwritten in the stars, against Imperial\u2019s\nthird team. The third team, lead by\nMaximilian Eggl and fielding Alina\nMititelu, Nikolai Rozanov and Ioannis\nEnglezos, had traversed an easier path.\nAfter losing against Birmingham in\ntheir third game, they had gone from\nstrength to strength and won all their\nconsequent games. This led to the\ngame of the two Imperials being quite\nsignificant in determining the final\nposition of the two teams. In a show of\nselflessness, Imperial thirds lost their\ngame securing Imperial second\u2019s win\nin this competition, leaving them in\nfifth position in the standings.\nIn addition to the team prizes, six\nImperial players won board prizes for\ntheir outstanding play. These included\nNikolai Rozanov, Veronica Foisor\nand Luke Barron. All in all, this was\nquite a success for the Chess club, and\nhopefully this can be repeated in next\nyear\u2019s competition.

When she\nstarted at College in 2010 Dr. Soh\nwas allegedly told not to lower the\nstandard of her teaching, despite\nnegative student feedback.\nAccording to the Times Higher\nEducation Dr Soh also claimed that\npositive student satisfaction from\nstudents were often related to students\nexpecting to receive strong marks in\nexaminations in that subject.\nAt the time of going to print, College\nwas unavailable for response.\nJoe Letts\nEditor-in-Chief\nFormer College\nlecturer claims unfair\ndismissal due to\nstudent satisfaction\nIt\u2019s still not to late to get involved in Felix...\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

A clinical trial tested\nthe enzymes, known as \u2018zinc-finger\nnucleases\u2019 and found that they were\nable to disrupt the gene CCR5, which\ncodes a protein essential for HIV entry\ninto T cells.\nAlthough the clinical trial was only\nbased on around 12 volunteers, it is a\npromising advancement in developing\nsuitable HIV treatment.\nResults showed that disruptions\nin the CCR5 gene allowed for a\nsignificant elevation of T cells in\nthe volunteers\u2019 blood, indicating a\ndecrease in the rate of successful\nHIV infection. Furthermore, upon\nhalf of the volunteers halting their\nantiretroviral drug therapy, their HIV\nlevels increased more slowly than\nexpected.\nWith the presence of HIV, the T\ncells containing the modified gene\nproliferated more rapidly \u2013 it seems\nHIV actually contributed to its own\ndownfall.\nThose who carry a mutation in the\ngene naturally are already resistant to\nHIV infection; in 2008 it was reported\nthat patient Timothy Ray Brown was\nfree from HIV after receiving donor\nbone-marrow stem cells that already\nboasted the disrupted versions of the\ngene. Unfortunately the provision of\ndonor bone-marrow stem cells is not\nan option for many people who are\ninfected with HIV, as the body is very\nlikely to attack the donor cells.\nUnfortunately the HIV soon\nreappeared in Brown, delivering\na sobering blow to the research\nT\nhe Public Library of Science,\nthe open access publisher of\nthe largest scientific journal\nin the world, PLoS One, has\nannounced that from the\n3rd of March, authors of an article in\nany of their seven journals must make\nall data related to the manuscript\npublicly available immediately upon\npublication.\nWhile many have welcomed this\npolicy, others are concerned that it\ncould be difficult to implement and\ndissuade people from publishing in\nPLoS journals.\nOpen access to results has been a\ndriving force behind the development\nand growth of PLoS, and the new open\ndata policy is a natural continuation\nof that. PLoS hope that sharing of\ndata will encourage collaborations\nand make it easier for old data to be\nobtained by relieving the burden on\nthe scientists. They also believe it\nwill permit validation and replication\nof results by third parties, as well\nas merging of data-sets to give new\ninsights, which would not have\nbeen possible with only summary\ndata. Advocates of open access have\npraised the policy, with Dan Gezelter\nof OpenScience.org stating that the\npolicy makes PLoS \u201ca much more\nattractive place to send our next\npaper\u201d.\nIn many fields, such as genomics,\nsubmission of data to online\nrepositories is already commonplace.\nIan Dworkin, a geneticist at Michigan\nState University, has benefitted in the\npast from data sharing and believes\nthe policy will allow other scientists\nto \u201caddress interesting and novel\nquestions in the future\u201d using the\narchived data.\nHowever, not everyone has greeted\nthe news so happily. Many authors\nare concerned about the size of the\ndata, which PLoS states must be\nsupplied in its raw form before any\nprocessing. The raw data produced\nwhen sequencing a human genome\ncan easily be over 300 GB, meaning\nauthors could have to make terabytes\nof data available. Exactly how this\nwill be achieved is not clear, but the\nproblem will also apply to many other\nfields handling large volumes of data.\nOthers are also concerned about\ndata privacy. Some data may also not\nbe released ethically, such as data\nrelating to individual patients, or\nlegally, if obtained from a third party.\nIn these cases, PLoS requires the data\nto be available upon request, but not\nnecessarily made public.\nIn addition, many groups use\nthe same data to produce multiple\npapers, each investigating the data in\na different way. By making the data\npublicly available after publishing a\nsingle paper, other groups will be able\nto use it, potentially being \u2018scooped\u2019 to\nan interesting finding. Writing on her\nblog, neuroscientist Erin McKiernan\ndescribes how in many cases, \u201cdata\nacquired are like gold\u201d, particularly\ncommunity at the time. However, with\nthis \u201cgene-editing\u201d technique, it seems\nthat things are looking up again.\nOne participant in the study was\nlucky enough not to have the virus\nreturn at all during the entirety of the\n12-week period during which the antiviral therapy was paused.\nUpon genome analysis, it was\nrevealed that this participant\nactually already had one of the CCR5\nmutations. Once the genes were\nmodified, over half of the T cells in his\nbody were resistant to HIV. \u201cNature\nhad done half of the job,\u201d says Pablo\nTebas, one of the immunologists\nleading the team at the University of\nPennsylvania, where the study took\nplace.\nThe next stage is to wean people\noff antiviral drugs altogether when\nundergoing the gene disruption\ntreatment, and it seems that this\ncould be a possibility. Other research\ngroups are using the same group of\nenzymes to alter gene sequences in\nhaematopoietic stem cells, which\ncould potentially allow patients to\nmake their own HIV resistant cells\nindefinitely.\nNot only that, newer enzymes may\nactually be able to replace DNA as\nopposed to disrupting it, and these\ncould be used to help treat a multiple\nof aliments from sickle cell anaemia\nthrough to cancer. Could enzymes\ntruly be the ultimate editors? Only\ntime \u00ad\n\u2013 and a lot of research \u2013 will tell.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature.2014.14813\nWIKIMEDIA COMMONS\nin labs with less funding, meaning\nreleasing their data could decrease\nthe amount of mileage they are able to\nget from a data set, impacting future\nfunding opportunities.\nThis new policy is a brave step\nalong the path to open science, and\nonly time will tell how it impacts\nPLoS journals, authors, and the wider\nscientific community.\nHIV, coloured yellow, attacking a T cell\n\n"
