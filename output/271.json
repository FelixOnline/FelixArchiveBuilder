    "content": "2 FELIX 22 January 1969\nCARNIVAL REPORT At present, Carnival is a quarter of the way to its\n\u00a310,000 target with about \u00a32,500 made. This figure\nincludes \u00a3950 made from collecting, about \u00a3150 from\ndirect donations and an anticipated \u00a31,400 from the Walk.\nHowever, about \u00a3450 of this last item only has come in to\ndate, and it is important that the remainder be collected\nand taken to the Carnival Office as soon as possible so\nthat the figures can be finalised.\nBreaking these figures\ndown into constituent College totals shows R. CJS.\nabout \u00a350 ahead of C&G on collections, and probably another \u00a3200 o\\ the\nwalk. However, on a per\ncapita basis, Mines are well\nahead of both.\nCOMPETITIONS\nThis term sees the start of\nthe competition between departmental years. During\nthe spring term in 1968, one\nyear in Guilds raised \u00a3600 to\ntake the only prize being\ncc ere a \u201440 gallons of bee\nbut this year, the committee\nhas decided to offer more\nprizes based on the number\nof people in a year. The\ndivisions for this are years\nwith less than 40 people,\nyears between 40 and 80\nand years with more than 80.\nTargets have been set for\nthese groups of \u00a3200, \u00a3400\nand \u00a3500 respectively, and\nyears making half of this\ntarget will automatically receive one, two and three\nbarrels of beer respectively.\nFor the years in each group\nmaking most in excess of its\ntarget, there will be further\nprizes to the value of \u00a325,\n\u00a350 and \u00a360 respectively.\nThe \" year's money \"\nwill consist of everything directly attributable to the year\n\u2014walk, collections, raffle\nand anything else the year\ndoes to raise funds. The\ncompetition will end on the\nlast Wednesday of the last\nweek of this term and the\nprizes will be distributed immediately afterwards.\nThe money raised to date\nwill, of course, count towards the prizes.\nThere will also be a prize\nof \u00a315 cash and a\" pot for\nthe individual who makes\nthe most during the competition. These figures only constitute the basis of prizes, and\nthe Committee will consider\nindividual cases as the competition develops.\nProcession\nThe procession that we\nhad hoped would take place\nin February has been abandoned following notice from\nthe police that it should be\nat 1 o 'clock on a Sunday\nmorning in Hyde Park with\nthe vehicles keeping up a steady 30 m.p.h.! There\n.seemed to be little purpose\nin this.\nCarnival Queen\nThe Carnival Queen competition sees the official\nentry of the University of S. Kensington to Carnival. Entries are expected from various colleges around South\nKensington who are participating in Carnival, particularly the R.C.M. which had\nsix people in the walk and\nis holding a number of\nconcerts for us. The elections will take place at the\nCarnival Discotheque on\nFebruary 18th, and it is\nhoped to have various celebrities at the event.\nDiscotheque\nThe discotheque is one of\nthe events of Carnival Week\nwhich is from the 17th to\nthe 22nd February. On the\n20th is the Albert Hall concert which should be finalised by the time this edition\ncomes to print, and the\nCarnival Hop takes place on\nSaturday 22nd. Festival & Fete\nLooking ahead to the\nthird term, from the 3rd to\nthe 10th May comes the\nCarnival Arts Festival\u2014a melange of concerts, drama,\nfilms, an international evening and who knows what\nelse. May 10th is the date\nfor the fe te, for which appeals will be made from\ntime to time. For the present we would be grateful\nfor crockery and old, clapped out pianos.\nMagazine\nThe Carnival Magazine is\nnot progressing as well as\nwas hoped and is at present\nin dire peril through lack of\nadvertising. However, contributions are still needed\u2014\nthe producers are planning\ntheir masterpieces on the\nlines of light hearted Punch\ncum Private Eye cartoons.\nArticles and photographs\nwould be greatly appreciated. It is also hoped to\nbring out a reprint of the\n1965 smash-hit Carnival record at the start of the third\nterm.\nRAFFLE\nTo date, the raffle has\nrealised just over \u00a350, and\ncould be one of the largest\nmoney-makers if every student sells a ticket to everyone they can think of. If\neach student sells the one\nbook they were given at the\nend of last year, it would\nmean a profit of \u00a31,000. If\nyou've sold yours please\nhand the money in to your\nyear rep; and, if not, try to\nremember where you threw\nit, and sell as many of the\ntickets as possible.\nThis covers the Carnival\nnews at present\u2014it only remains for the years to start\nwinning this ale (or whatever they would prefer), for\neveryone to be happy.\nCollections Walk Raffle\n(so far)\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\nR.C.S.3502152 C&G300112110s.

On Sunday all were\neventually found \u2014 usually\nby accident \u2014 except one\nDutchman who had missed\nthe boat! After an invasion\nof Southside bar, the proceedings were adjourned to\nthe President's room in\nwhich a suitable beverage\nhad been installed for the\noccasion. The singing of\n\"Old Macdonald's Farm\"\nwas accompanied by irate\nphone calls from the\nMews.\nThe official programme\ntook over on Monday with\nthe visitors being introduced\nto the Dean, who introduced\nthem to the R.S. M. and\nsherry. Tony Mason found\nthe missing Dutchman wandering aimlessly around the\nRSM. In the afternoon,\neveryone wandered aimlessly\naround the RSM before the\nparty in Weeks with its devastating punch;-'\nLiquid Lunch\nTuesday started quietly\u2014\nit had to\u2014with a visit to\nEnthovens where a liquid\nlunch was provided by Pete\nHarding, an ex IC president.\nFrom there to the varsity\nmatch which inconsiderately\nstarted before closing time,\nthus accounting for the\nparty's late arrival.\nThe evening's entertainment was Christmas Wine\nHall Dinner.; followed for\nsome by bowling and for the\nNorwegians-by a trip to the\nflesh pots of Soho.\nMore Liquid\nWednesday morning saw\na seminar on Student Representation, unfortunately cut\nshort by a prior engagement\nwith Charrington's Brewery.\nIn the evening a coach trip\nto the Prospect where Brunei and Surrey Universities\nwere out sung with a brilliant\nrendition of \" Old MacDonald.\"\nThe next day, an early\nstart for Coventry colliery\nwhere Coalboard efficiency\nfailed to provide safety\nboots. It did, however, provide a meal that looked like\nMooney's leftovers \u2014 it\ndidn't taste too good either.\nCarol-singing in the evening\nfound everyone a bit hoarse\nOn Friday the Mines Ball\nfollowed a sightseeing trip\nled by John Andrews, the\nonly responsible Minesman\nstill awake. At the Ball, the\nPresident and Foreign\nofficer provided a drunken\ncabaret and the Foreign\nStudents expressed their\ngratitude with gifts of Borovichka, Moonshine, Scotch\nand a ceremonial sword\nfrom the Germans. A fitting\nend to a superb week!\nR. OLLEY\nUNSA Conference\nIn the last week of the\nChristmas vacation a delegation from IRC attended\nthe Annual General Conference of the UK United\nNations Students Association, which took place at\nNottingham University.\nLack of respect for Human Rights and for the dignity of man was the theme\nof the conference. Near\nhome in Northern Ireland\nthe Special Powers Act legislates in such a way as to\ncontravene two thirds of the\nUN Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights. The electoral system contains many\nundemocratic features and\nreligious discrimination is\nwidespread. The conference\ncalled upon Her Majesty's Government to introduce a\" Bill of Rights \" at Westminster which could guarantee full democratic rights,\nand representation to all the\npeoples of Northern Ireland.\nThe conference decided to\nsupport the liberation movements in Africa, Asia and\nLatin America in their\nstruggle against political\nrepression and economic ex-plo it ation. An emergency resolution\nwas introduced by IRC\n\" viewing with concern \" the\nPope's encyclical on birth\ncontrol because of the suffering it caused, in particular in Latin America.\nThe conference considered it of paramount importance that the People's Republic of China should\nbecome a member of the\nUN, not only because it\ncontains a quarter of the\nworld's population but because it is a nuclear power\nin its own right. China,\nthough not at the moment a member of the UN, should\nbe included in any negotiations on disarmament.\nThe conference ended on\na more sombre note; it was\nproposed that the UNS A Annual Dinner be abolished\nand that it be replaced by\na symbolic meal of rolls,\ncheese, butter and water.\nThis was carried \u2014 the\nmoney saved will go towards\nthe charities which UNS A supports.\nMORA GH McGREGOR. COM MU NICA TVinod Gv\u00a7a John Hunt\nLilas Campion George Asaimakis\nAny suggestions, comments or complaints are\nwelcome to be aired at informal floor-rep. discussion\nmeetings. These are held\nevery Monday lunchtime in\nthe Union lower lounge,\nand every Friday lunchtime\nin Southside upper lounge.\nTwo floor-reps, will be\n\"informally around\" to answer questions (but don't imagine seeing them is a substitute for attending\nUnion meetings !).\nUp to now discussions\nhave been centred on a mixture of refectory-orientated\ncomplaints, information on\nI.C., and general discussion\non the purpose (or lack of\nit) of student life. Views\non certain topics, such as\nthe I.C. constitution, President's Ball, Felix, etc., are\nespecially welcome, and information will be offered\nabout Blue Books, Directories, U.S.K., failure rates,\ncouncil meetings, and a list\nof the coming meetings of\ncommittees in the Union, at\nwhich you are welcome to\nattend.\nMore people could and\nshould go to these meetings to see the floor-reps.\u2014\nuse their photos to accost\nthem there.\nIONS Piers Cor by n David Foster\n\n"

    "content": "I 've written about freedom of the press before in\nthis column when I voiced\nmisgivings about Exec's handling of the \" Sennet\nAffair.\" Recent attacks on\nFELIX, particularly over its\nreporting of the disappointing first JURGO meeting,\nbrought this same issue to a head at this term's first\nmeeting of the Publications\nBoard at which even \" Thev\nTell Me .. .\" was criticised.\nThe Pro-Rector's invitation\nto Piers \" New-Think\"\nCorbyn to discuss his\nJURGO article, on the front\npage of the last FELIX,\nhas merely added fuel to the\nfire. Dermott Corr, Guild's President, who has led the\nattack on FELIX, denies he\nis seeking revenge for the\npoor publicity he has received lately, but the composition of the Publications\nBoard, which controls\nFELIX finances, obscures\nTHEY TELL ME.... the position. As long as the\nPub' Board is dominated by\nExec, and no ordinary\nUnion members sit on it,\nthen anything they say on\nFELIX editorial policy will\nbe clouded by the suspicion\nthey are seeking personal\nglory. This is why Piers\nCorbyn's suggestions for a reformed Pub' Board are\nvaluable as they would\nmove power over FELIX\nfrom the Exec to the Union\nmember (by replacing the\nConstituent College Presidents with ordinary Union\nmembers), and possible interference from the Governors on the grounds of\n\" staff-student relations,\" by\nputting a staff member on\nthe Board.\nIn all the Christmas fur ore over the Prices and Incomes Board report of lecturers' salaries, the most important\nsuggestion (from a student's point of view) seems to have\nbeen forgotten. A lot of publicity was given to one very\nsmall section of the report, which considered using student\nsurveys to help award teaching bonuses. This was in fact\nonly part of a very good general idea of relating academics'\nsalaries and status to their teaching ability.\nAt present, research is the most important factor in\ndetermining an academic's progress. The argument for\nthis system is that work on the frontiers of science is necessary in order to teach satisfactorily at an advanced level.\nAs a result of this there appears to be very little incentive\nfor the staff to increase the amount of time and effort they\nput into teaching. Of the academics that do work hard on\nthe teaching side, the majority do so out of a feeling of\nduty without any hope of personal advantage. In fact those\nmembers of staff who neglect their research in favour of\nteaching duties can be at a direct disadvantage. This seems\nto me to be unfair on them and unfair on us.\nI only hope that careful and objective analysis of the\nPIB report will lead to adequate rewards for those academics who do combine teaching with research. This is\nthe test of maintaining a real difference between a University and a research institute.\nWith newly installed parking meters ticking away in\nQueens Gate this seems a reasonable time to ask what\nfuture there is, if any, for the student with a car. At the\nmoment we have a grand total of 154 parking places on\nthe College Campus, and it seems unlikely that this number\nwill increase by very much in the near future. Now that\nQueens Gate has succumbed, it will be almost impossible to\ndrive in and leave a car just outside IC and so stickers are\nlikely to become very prize possessions indeed.\nWith this in mind, we must devise a better method of\ndistributing these places than the one used at the moment.\nThe old application form asks one vague question. \" Why\ndo you want a parking place.\" It is assumed that people\nknow what this really means\u2014i.e. how long does it take\nyou to travel in by car as opposed to Public Transport?,\nwhat are the relative costs?, do you bring in any regular\npassengers?, etc., etc. If we get in answer to the present\nquestion, \" Because I have a car and travel into College\neach day,\" this may be a perfectly valid reason for having\na parking place, but it doesn't help in choosing between\nseveral hundred applications.\nAnother gaping anomaly in the present system is that\nin yone not living in a hall of residence is classed as a com-nute r, and has to fight for his parking place on the grounds\nj f how difficult his journey is. So obviously anyone who\nives in Queens Gate just doesn't qualify for a space. It\nseems to me that we should place local residents on the\n>ame footing as people in hall, and adjust the ratio of\n\u2022es idents and commuter places accordingly.\nREX LOWIN\nTo the general detriment\nof ICU, Collinge's feud with\nExternal Affairs Committee\nseems to be growing\u2014perhaps this is why we have still\nto see any action from Welfare or External Affairs on\nthe grants cut (especially on\na London weighting for\nP.G. s on which the AUT( staff union) and ASTMS\n(technicians union) have\nhave recently acted). Rob\nCollinge, ICU Welfare Officer, seems to take a negative attitude to the \"Univer-s it y of South Ken \"(USK)\nidea, and in particular was\nthe only Council member to\noppose reciprocal membership with RCA.\nTwo further questions are\nbemusing ICU. Why did\nCollinge support giving\n\" MORA DE\" \u00a325 at Council but oppose it at the\nUnion Meeting? Why after\nall the obvious confusion\nover the lack of coordination of distributing notices\nand nearness to the start of\nTerm did he, at the Overseas\nStudents' Committee EGM,\nrefuse to allow second ers at\nthe meeting to an incompletely seconded opponent\nof his friend George Assimakis? George was therefore re-elected unopposed.\nPerhaps too, someone would\nexplain why when electing\na committee originally intended to host and welcome\nOverseas Students at the\nCollege the hosts are not allowed to vote\u2014only Overseas Students can now vote.\n\u2022 * * *\nIt is a privilege to have\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury visit IC and two of his\ntalks could be of particular\ninterest\u2014one to the Rugby\nClub and one to the H.G. Wells Society. The visit\nrepresents in many ways the\ngrowing rapprochement between Science and Religion.\nIt is some time from the\nFELIX 22 January 1969 \u20ac\nheady days of the thirties\nwhen science seemed to have\nthe answer to everything.\nIncreased affluence has not\nbrought increased contentment and the realization is\nspreading that we may have\nlost sight of both the mystery and purpose of life.\nAbove all the events of this\nChristmas\u2014the richest nation in the world can circle\nmen around the moon but\nnot extricate itself from a bloody land war in Vietnam\n\u2014have given a new twist to\nthe old line of St. Paul; \" I may have all the knowledge\nand understand all secrets;\nI may have all the fait l needed to move mountain*\n\u2014but if I have not love 1\nam nothing.\"\nLES EBDON\nWelcome to the rat race\nWe don't know why the rat has become the\npejorative symbol of the human condition.\nEverything struggles for survival; why single\none out?

    "content": "4 FELIX 22 January 1969\nAt the beginning of this term, a meeting of the Public it ions Board was held, basically to discuss FELIX. The\nPublications Board is a sub-committee of Union Council\nand is made up of the Executive, two reps from council,\nLilas Campion and Piers Corbyrs, as wall as the editors of\nFelix, Phoenix and the Union Handbook. At this meet-ing, criticisms were made of the truth of articles which\nhave appeared in this paper and, more seriously, of the\ngeneral editorial policy.\nIn fact th s re have been minor factual errors in some\nof the recent issues, but the sla ff of the paper work extremely hard to try to ensure that what appears in FELIX\nis the truth. Few people are annoyed more than us when\nwe make a mistake.\nThe more important item at that meeting was a motion, later withdrawn, deploring our editorial policies\nand suggesting that we publish mere articles of interest\nto t tid student body. The implication that FELIX does\nnot publish enough articles of interest to the people of\nthis college is irrelevant to what I want to talk about. We\ndo, however, think that the material that appears in FELIX\nis fairly well balanced and of general interest. The real\nthing is that the Publications Board, a sub-committee of\ncouncil, was really attempting to get its view reflected in\nthe composition and writing of FELIX. For people in\nhigh Union office to try and meddle with the editorial\npolicies of this paper surely negates the purpose of having\nan independent newspaper. In order to supply independent comment and fair reporting, FELIX should not be\nin a position where it can be subjected to pressure of this\nsort.\nAll this boils down to the composition of ths Publications Board. In \"They tell me . . .,\" Les Ebdom ta'ki\nabout Piers Corbyn's proposals for reconstructing the\nboard. Electing ordinary students and a stiff member on\nthe Board would help rid ir of the \"big brother\" image,\nbut, although being a great improvement it would merely\nreplace censorship by the few with censorship by the\nmasses. The only real answer is to abolish the Publications Board. Make the editorial staff of FELIX completely free to make their own policies and, to cover the\nfinancial aspects, let the editorial staff be responsible to\ncouncil directly for the finances of the paper. This would\nensure a free FELIX for all time.\nX EDITOR: PAUL HEATH\nImperial College\nLondon, S.W.7 Tel. KEN 2963\nInternal 2881\nAsst. Editor: Mary Ford\nNews.

A party will leave\nI.C. at 1.45 p.m. from outside the Union Arch.\n(2) Copies of the petition\nwill be sent round the departments and will also be\navailable at a stall in the\nUnion Main Entrance Hall\nduring Monday and Friday\nlunch hour. The stall, which\nwill also display information\non Soviety Jewry, will be set\nup daily during the week.\n(3) A motion asking the\nUnion to support the campaign will be presented at\ntomorrow's meeting (Jan.\n23rd).(4) At L.S.E. on Wednesday, 5th February at 7.30\np.m. there will be a teach-in\non Soviet Jewry. Full details may be seen on posters\nlater.\nIn conclusion, I must\nmention that Bertrand Russell, the late Martin Luther\nKing, the late Senator Robt.\nKennedy, about 330 British\nM.P.s, and many progressive\nliberals, radicals and communists have expressed their\nconcern about the tragic\nsituation of Soviet Jewry.\nMay I ask all members of\nI.C. to show their concern\nby supporting the above ac-t ions. Yours,\nLIONEL FINKELSTEIN,\n(Physics 3).\nParking Comments Dear Sir,\nIn my letter to Felix\ndated 27th November, 1968,\nI said that the student commuter zones \" D\" and \"Sc\"\nwere reserved only for those\npeople with allocated stickers during college hours,\nand that outside these hours\nthey were open to anyone.\nThere have been so many\ncars that are not registered\nwith the college using these\nzones, that in the case of\nobstructions being caused.\nthe owners have been impossible to trace. In fu-ture, outside college hours,\nonly those cars registered\nwith the coll ge will be allowed to park in these\nzones.\nAny I.C. student can obtain an I.C. General sticker\nby registering his car at the\nSecurity Office in the Beit\nHall entrance.\nThe majority of residents\nhaving \" S\" stickers should\nhave their key to the locking posts by now, and after\nweek ending 24 Jan., none\nof these people should have\nan excuse for parking in\nfront of Southside in the\n\" Sc \" zone. After this date\nany resident found parking\nin the wrong zone will be\nin danger of losing his\nsticker.\nYours faithfully,\nD. FOSTER,\n(Chairman, Residents\nParking Committee).\nFAREWELL Linstead bar, shown above\nin action at the recent party,\nwill be officially opened to-morrow. From this Friday\nall are welcome to use it as\nan alternative to Southside\nWith this issue, FELIX says\ngoodbye to our present pr in ter, Mr. R. Garby of West\nLondon Offset Co.\nMr. Garby has been associated with FELIX for over\n14 years and the editors and\nstaff during this period owe\nmuch to him for his fatherly\nnter est and for all the late\nnights and hard work he has\nput in.\nFELIX wishes to thank\nMr. Garby and all his staff and\nsincerely wish them all happiness in the future.\nMr. and Mrs. R. Garby\nBar Prices Increase Price increases take effect\nin the Union and Southside\nbars from February 1st. There will be an extra penny\non all draught beers, bringing the prices to 2s.2d. for\nUnion bitter and 2s.4d. in\nSouthside. Spirits prices will\nalso go up to 2s.6d. allowed in the Union Bar,\nUNION i? MEETING! I THURSDAY!\ni JAN 23 jI1.00 PNI. {\nf CONCERT ji HALL ;\nUniversity Challenge from British Leylond\nThe Jaguar XJ6 is a product of one of the most skilful and\nexperienced design teams operating in today's motor\nindustry; it has been hailed as the most important new\nBritish car of the decade. But in the decade yet to come\nfresh challenges await not only Jaguar but all the Divisions\nof British Leyland; challenges relating to future product\nstrategy; util is ation of facilities; market representation;\noverseas expansion. And, fun-da mentally, of management\ntalent\u2014the availability, in sufficient numbers, of intelligent,\nhard-working men and women\nwith the initiative and drive\nto lead the expansion of the\nworld's fifth largest motor\nvehicle manufacturer from its\nbases in this country.\nThis last challenge (and, indeed, all the others) British\nLeyland invites graduates to share. We need engineers in\nresearch, design and development, production engineering, production management, technical sales and\nservice engineering. We need graduates of all disciplines\nin financial analysis, purchasing, production control, mark-e ting, systems analysis and personnel. In all these fields\nthe Divisions of British Leyland have vacancies which\ncan employ the abilities of university trained minds.\nWe offer to graduates the conditions of service which are\nto be expected from a large and responsible organisation.\nTraining programmes have been developed for all major\nfunctions which will ensure that graduates are properly\nequipped to start their careers, while salaries during training and early service are highly competitive.\nBut the major emphasis must be to place people in a specific job as rapidly as possible, to demonstrate >their\nability and potential for the future. For British Leyland is at\nthe beginning of a long and exciting period which will\nprove the ability of the British motor industry to meet and\nto match a strong international challenge. We are looking\nfor people with the brains, the initiative and the a mibit ion to tackle this challenge with us.\nIf the prospect appeals, arrange an\ninterview with your Appointments\nBoard, as British Leyland will be\nvisiting your University on\nWednesday 5th and\nThursday 6th February\nOur team will be talking about the\nkind of organisation we are and\nhow you as a graduate could fit in.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nNEWSPAPER OF THE IMPERIAL COLLEGE STUDENTS UNION\nNo 27<f1/3V WEDNESDAY, 22 JANUARY 1969\nPRICE 4d Overseas Students\nElections\nThe I.C. Overseas Students' Committee, which for\nthe last two years has existed to look after the welfare of students at the college from overseas, held its\ngeneral meeting on Thursday, 9th January, and was\nattended by about 100 stu-dents.\nAt the meeting last term,\nit was decided that the\nCommittee should cease to\nbe under the control of the\nSocial Clubs' Committee\nand should become a completely independent organ-is ation. Last term's committee was dissolved and\nthe purpose of this term's meeting was to elect a chairman and six other students\nto form a new committee.\nThere were objections to\nthis new constitution, and\nMr. Vinod Garga said that\nthe overseas students ought\nnot to form an independent\ngroup of their own and proposed the motion that the\nmeeting should be transferred to the next I.C. Union general meeting for\ndiscussion, Mr. George\nAssimakis, opposing the\nmotion, claimed that most\nof the Union body held a disinterested view towards\nthe Overseas Students'\nCommittee and that if the\nCommittee was elected at a Union general meeting, the\nresult of such an election\nwould be meaningless. A few questions followed and\nthen Mr. Garga's motion\nwas put to the vote, and was\ndefeated.\nOne student asked why\nhe hadn't been told about\nthis change in the const it u tion, and this led Mr. Assimakis to propose the motion that the students present approved of the constitution. But before anyone\nopposed the motion, Mr.\nSam moved that the election\nfor the committee should\ntake place immediately and\nany further problems could\nbe discussed at a later meet-ing. Mr. Sam's motion was\nput to the vote and was carried almost unanimously.\nMr. Assimakis was the\nonly candidate for chair-man, and there were seven\ncandidates for the commit-tee. The voting slips were\ncollected and the meeting\nwas then closed.\nThe Committee now consists of:\nChairman : G.A.C. Assimakis.\nCommittee: D. Duml, A. Doktas, D. Goodall, C. Robinson, Miss R. Shakir,\nA.S. Sittamoalam.\nMinibus Smash \u2014\nnone hurt\nEight members of the\nCross-Coun!ry C \u00abub were\nfortunate to escape unhurt\nwhen the R.C. C. Transit\nminibus skidded into a ditch near Grantham, Lincolnshire, on the 11th January. The min5 JUS suffered\nextensive damage to its\nbodywork ; but none of the\nocc u ants suffered any\nmore than minor bruising.\nThe accident occurred on\na deceptive bend at the bottom of a hill. Geoff Pearsc-n, the driver, was unable\nto control the vehicle on the\nslippery road surface and it\nran off the road on the inside\nof the bend, eventually\nwheeling round to a halt. No\nother vehicles were involved\nand it is fortunate that the\nthree in the front were wearing safety belts or they might\nhave been thrown out.\nPolice later gave the club\na lift to Grantham station,\ncalling in, en route, at the\npolice station for cups of tea\nand minor first aid.\nThe minibus is at present\nin a garage at Grantham\nawaiting inspection by the\ninsurance assessors. The\nvehicle is fully covered but\nthere may be some loss on\ninsurance and loss of profit\nwhile it is out of action as\nwell as inconvenience to\nclubs looking for transport.\nThe R.C. C. Transport Committee will inform user clubs\nwhen the transport situation\nis back to normal.\nGeoff Pearson has now\nbeen removed from the\nminibus driving list and the\nCross County Club, because\nof this and previous incidents when the vehicle has\nbeen in their care, have been\nbanned from using the\nTransit.\nArtist's Perspective of the east side of Princes Gardens\nIJC. APPEAL\nImperial -College launched a \u00a32 million public appeal\nfor student and staff acc com mod ation and for academic\nand general purposes, at a press conference on Thursday,\n9th January. The appeal has been quietly suckling itself\nfor over a year and the conference was the first public\nannouncement of its existence.\nWhencontacted last week. Air Vice Marshall A. A. Adams, the Resident Campaign Director, said that\n\"organisation ally the thing\nis developing nicely \" and it\nis believed that an appreciable sum has already been\ncollected. Air Vice-Marshal\nAdams hopes that the bulk\nof the\u00abmoney will be in by\nthe end of the appeal year\nwith covenanted gifts providing a steady influx of\ncapital over the next seven\nyears.\nOf the \u00a32 million being\nasked for, \u00a31,100,000 is\nneeded for immediate residential building and con ver sion. This includes \u00a3200,000\nfor student houses providing\naccommodation for 130 stu-dents, \u00a3200,000 to acquire\nand convert property for 45\nstaff flats and \u00a3700,000 for\nfurther halls> of residence in\nPrinces Gardens to house\n275 students. A further\n\u00a3200,000 is needed for the\ndevelopment of the College\nField Station at Silwood\nPark. The remainder of the\nmoney, \u00a3700,000, is required\nfor academic and general\npurposes.\nThe College is almost\ncompletely without any endowment and needs some\nfree funds which it can\ndirect whenever the needs\nand opportunities arise,\nin order for it to maintain Us standards of\nacademic excellence. A little money at the early\nstages makes all the difference to the success of promising new ideas, and this\nmoney is little and thinly\nspread at the moment.\nSights high\nOpening the press con-ference, Lord Sherfield,\nChairman of the Governing\nBody, outlined the background to the appeal and\nadmitted \" we may seem to\nhave set our sights high, but\nthe target is not high in relation to the need.\" He\nwent on to explain the problem at I.C.\" Imperial College is a national institution\n\u2014as such it is at a disadvantage in comparison both\nwith the old and the new\nuniversities. In comparison\nwith the old it has no en-dow ment, in comparison\nwith the new it does not enjoy local or regional sup-port.\"\nLord Penney stressed\nI.C's connections with industry and went more deeply\ninto the problems of financing research and the valuable contribution to the\nagricultural economy made\nat Silwood Park. The\n\"Strong Home Team.\" how-ever, was caught a little off\nbase when questioned more\nabout our help to industry.\nThere was more than a little\n\"um-ing\" and \"ah-ing\"\nWhen they were asked to\nname people from I.C. who\nhad proved invaluable in\nindustry.\nAnother speech came\nfrom Professor Lighthill, the\nRoyal Society Research Professor at college, who could\nspeak from a more detached\npoint of view than most\nothers, because he is neither\nan old student nor has any\nformal academic responsibilities here.\nFinally a speech from\nUnion President Rex Lowin\ntalking mainly about accommodation from the student\npoint of view and drawing\nbroadly on his own personal\nexperience. He explained\nthe residential situation and\nthe concepts of halls and\nstudent houses with more\nclarity than anyone else.\nB.B.C. The response from the\npress was not good, and\nAnn Nolan, the college\nPress Officer, was disappointed at the small attendance by representatives\nof the National Press. However, the appeal was given\nreasonable space in what\ncan be termed the \"quality\"\npapers and the BBC have\nbroadcast interviews with\nLord Penney and Rex.\nSo the appeal is launched;\nI.C's first public appeal for\nmoney since 1945. It is regrettable that a\" national\ninstitution \" like I.C. should\nhave to beg for money in\nthis way but if we are to\nAlb'\nConcerts\nEnts n lans for their Albert Hall concert, on the\n27th February, were turned\nUDside down last week when\nthe Ronzo Dog Band, who\nwould have been the main\ndraw, exercised a clause in\ntheir contract which enabled\nthem to opt out up to six\nweeks before the event.\nThey beat the deadline by\none day.\nAfter this Ents are left\nwith Joe Cocker, Spooky\nTooth, Free, the college\ngroup, Smile, and com per e John Peel. They are trying\nfor the young\" Rascals., Last\nweek-end there was serious\ntalk of trying for Cliff\nRichard (!).\nCarnival have obtained\nSpencer Davis, East of\nEden, the Herd and the\nLove Affair for their Albert\nHall concert the week be-fore.\nFelix\nregrets\nDue to the desperate financial position of FELIX and\nthe increased costs of our\nnew printers, the drastic\nstep of a price increase has\nbeen taken.\nFrom the next issue\nFF/ JX WILL COST SIXPENCE.\nThe price of FELIX was\nlast raised in 1957 from 3d. to 4d. so we hope our\nreaders will not bau lk at\ncontributing another 2d.a fortnight to a worthy cause\nremain on equal academic\nfooting with such progressive heavily backed institutions as MIT and Caltech.\nthen it is necessary. The\nGovernment having financed\nthe 1953 Jubilee scheme for\nexpansion (which is now\nthree-quarters completed) it\nis understandable that we\ncannot expect further aid\nfrom the Exchequer for\nour present needs.\nWe, as students, shou lJ support this appeal in principle if we can't support U in any other way. That it\nis in our own interests can\nbe plainly seen\u2014just look '\nat the total required for\nstudent accommodation.\n\n"

Tyler took the court and\nconvincingly won their game\nas a in st King's3 rd pair.\nThen the 2nd IC pair, J. M. Burley and P. Lannen, the\nlatter having his debut for\nthe IC team, were just as convincingly beaten by King's1st. So the score stood at\n4-4 as the IC 3rd pair prepared to play the King's2 nd pair. P. Poyser and P. Stevenson raised their game\nadmirably and, in spite of\nthe nervous tension which\ncould be felt by those watching as well as the players,\nsucceeded in clinching the\nmatch 5-4 for IC.

McCardle had opened the scoring with a well taken goal.\nWithin the next half-hour, McCardle had scored two\nfurther goals. However, Q.M. C. were still playing challenging football, and helped by mistakes in the L.C. defence, were able to score three goals before half-time.\nA rather dejected XI lined up for the second half, but\nsoon with the defence determined to atone for their mis-takes, the whole team was playing with its early confidence.\nWith A. Clarke and J. Cannar prompting the forwards from\nthe full-back positions, it was only a matter of time before\nI.C. scored again. The goal came when D. King fastened\non to a good ball from R.

C. still did not give up, and with about 20 minutes\nto go scored a good goal.\nJ. DARLEY.\n10 pin bowling LEAGUE NEWS\nLast term the Club played\nthe first matches in the new\nSouthern Zone of the National Universities League.\nIn this Southern Zone which\nwas only started last term\nthe club has had mixed success. In general the matches\nhave been very close but\nquite often we have been\nunlucky. It is possible to\nlose by just a single pin out\nof a team total of 800 in\neach of the three games and\nget no points at all.\nOn several occasions we\nb ave been narrowly beaten\nby a few pins after some\nreally close games.\nUntil the last match of the\nterm the three college teams\nhad a joint position of third\nin this league, but in this last\nmatch we fell badly. This\nwas against Portsmouth, the\nleague leaders and after\ntravelling down there it was\nfound that the Navy had\ntaken over the whole bowl\nfor a National tournament,\neven though Portsmouth had\nbooked lanes for our match.\nAn alternative venue was\nfound at Havant about 10\nmiles away, and the 0-4,1-3,\n0-4 thrashing we received\nthere can perhaps be partly\nattributed to this messing\nabout there.\nWith only one fixture left\nout of London, and therefore less travelling, we can\nperhaps hope for better\nthings this term.\nChristmas\nGliding\nAn expedition from I.C. Gliding Club spent Christmas week at Portmoak, near\nKinross, where the club's Skylark 4 and a Dart 17 are.\nOn two occasions Frank\nIrving took the Dart to over\n9,000 feet in wave lift, while\nTim Tuck persuaded the\nSkylark to over 8,500. In\naddition to this, the Skylark\nspent about 15 hours on one\nor other of the two magnificent ridges, Bishop's Hill or\nBonarty. All members of the\nexpedition greatly enjoyed\nthe visit which is becoming\nan annual event.\nDuring the last term the\nSkylark spent quite a few\nweeks away from Lasham,\nvisiting other sites in search\nof some hill-soaring. Despite winds in all the wrong\ndirections two of our members managed to soar the\nridge at Dunstable, one of\nthese collecting both the\nqualifying flights for his\nBronze C certificate. At\nChallock, in Kent, another\neven managed to find thermals in November, an unusual occurrence in this\nclimate of ours.\nQuite apart from being\nvery enjoyable, these visits\nto strange sites are intended\nto keep our more experienced pilots in practice during the winter, ready for\nnext summer's cross-country\nseason. The Skylark covered\nover 700 miles last year and\nit is hoped to exceed this\nnext summer.\nAt Lasham, instruction\ncontinues in the two-seater\nEagle every week-end, weather permitting, up to Easter\nwhen there will probably be\none or two courses for the\npilots under training.\nHOCKEY\nI.C.4 Hatfield T.C.0 The first XI started the\nsecond half of the session\nwith a well deserved victory\nagainst Hatfield. On a Saturday when the vast majority of hockey fixtures in\nLondon were cancelled a great deal of credit must go\nto Arthur and his staff for\nproducing such a good\npitch. Both defences tackled\nhard in the first half, but\nI.C's forwards were more\nconstructive and Hayward\nscored the first goal after\nsome good work on the right\nby Sargent and Manning.\nThen on the stroke of half\ntime Comyn scored a second\ngoal from a short corner.\nIn the second half I.C. continued to dominate the\ngame and the third goal\ncame from the inside left.\nWalker, following a long\ncorner. The climax of the\nmatch came when Manning\nslotted home a shot from a narrow angle practical lv decapitating the opposition\nj To al kee o er in the process.\nThe Hatfield defence was\nnow completely de moral is ed and I.C. should have scored\nseveral more goals and, but\nfor a woeful lack of co he sion, in the forward line,\nwould have done so.\nThe strength of any club\nis based on its lower elevens,\nand it is regrettable that we\nhave had to abandon both\nthe fourth and fifth elevens\ndue to the lack of support.\nIt is hoped that the three\nelevens, which we are running this term will be fully\nsupported.\n1st XI team last Saturday :\nTownsley; Burtt and\nComyn; Sargent, Hill (Capt)\nand Giddings; Manning,\nMudan, Hayward, Walker\nand Rodger.\nIf you have an electronics based degree\nthis should concern YOU\nHewlett.

Appointed editor of\nPhoenix for the session\n1958-59, Irving was sacked\nfrom his post in February\n1959 for the extreme rightwing nature of his views.\nAfter this he was surprisingly allowed to edit\na magazine, Carnival\nTimes,\" under the general\ncontrol of the London University Carnival Committee,\nin which publication he inserted an eight-page centre\nsection with, among other\nthings, an article supporting apartheid. The editorial\nclaimed that Hitler's regime\nwas \" the first great unifying\nforce that Europe has\nknown for six hundred\nyears.\" The magazine\ncaused no little embarrassment to the Carnival com-mitte e, and the World University Service, a non-poli-t ical organisation concerned\nsolely with the welfare of\nstudents, in whose benefit\nthe carnival was run.\nWhile still at college, Irving started his book, \"The\nDestruction of Dresden,\"\ndealing with the mass bombing of civilians in the war,\nwhich led Hochhuth to write\n\" Soldiers,\"\nNEXT FELIX\nTi.2 next FELIX will be\na large CAREERS Issue\nwith advice and assistance\non deciding your fu tura career.

Also he has successfully exploited the rhythmic novelty which so clearly\nseparates his style from that of his predecessors.\nDo not think, however, that this work is unapproachable as is so much contemporary music, since the opposite\nis the case, and it flows with a spontaneity which makes it\ngreatly enjoyable even on a first hearing.\nIn this recording Alan Wicks gives a polished performance on the organ in St. Paul's Cathedral, London.\nRecording quality is quite up to standard but, be warned,\nit will severely test any loudspeaker and show up any which\nare substandard.\nStravinsky :\u2014Complete piano music. PSY 30006.\nPlayed by Thomas Rajna\nFor some peculiar reason Stravinsky's piano music\nis still relatively unknown. It may be because it is a comparatively small number of pieces, but it is certainly not\nbecause they are lacking in any of the qualities which have\nmade the composer's other music so popular.\nThe works on this record span some thirty four years\nfrom 1908 to 1942, and a study of them gives fascinating\nglimpses of the development of Stravinsky's musical style;\nindeed they often give indications of styles later to be\nexpanded in large works.\nThe pieces are the four studies OP 7, the Serenade in\nA major, the piano rag music, the Sonata of 1924 and\nfinally the humorous tango and the circus polka. The\nlatter, originally written for a young elephant is the only\npiece to have been orchestrated and has since become a concert favourite.\nTha Voice and Pen of C, Day-Lewis. PSY 30004\nCecil Day-Lewis was appointed Poet Laureate on 2nd January 1968\u2014for which he receives the magnificent sum\nof \u00a370\"p.a. plus \u00a327 \" in lieu of a butt of sack.\"\nOn this record he introduces and reads about nineteen\nof his poems; all those we hear have some connection with\nIreland where the poet feels he has his roots. Not that the\npoems need explanation, however, since they are easily\nunderstandable and, if there is a message it stands out\nclearly. The most evocative is about the aunt who raised\nhim on new roots, as he puts it, in a nursing home. This\npoem ends:\n\" Lord, how can it be justified?\"\nMost people do not buy records of poetry, but when it\ncomes to this one they should reconsider since it is well\nworth having,\nAnything to Declare?\nA remarkable musical revue comes to the Westminster Theatre on 30th Jan.\nWritten and acted by fifty\nyoung men and women from\nnineteen countries, \" Anything to Declare?\" has been\ntouring Europe for the last\nfifteen months.\nI saw this show while\nattending an international\nconference for Moral Rearmament in Caux, Switzerland, last summer. It was\ncreated by delegates to a similar conference in 1967.\nSince then it has visited\nAustria, Sweden, Holland,\nFrance and Switzerland, as\nwell as Liverpool and Birmingham.\nJean Rey, Chairman of\nthe Commission of the\nCommon Market, said at\nCaux that Europe's most urgent need was to find an aim\noutside its own leaders.\nOnly then, he underlined,\nwould we be able to bridge\nour age-old differences and\nprejudices. \" Anything to\ndeclare?\" sets out to show\nwhat that aim might be.\nI have met and talked\nwith many of the cast. They\nrepresent a real cross section\nof Europe. The orchestra\nalone comes from seven different countries. The cast\nranges from a German\nminer, to a Swedish pastry-cook, a Danish pop-singer to\na French steel worker, a Swiss hairdresser to an\nEnglish radio operator.\nMany are students who have\npostponed or interrupted\ntheir studies because they\nare convinced they are doing\nan essential task which cannot be left undone. This is\ntheir most interesting characteristic\u2014they have a real\naim in life which demands\nall they can give.\nThey have gained much\nexperience in the past year\nin tackling some of the\nproblems of Europe\u2014whether the language disputes\nin the South Tyrol, Belgium\nor the Jura, industrial deadlock in the docks of Gothenborg, Rotterdam, Antwerp\nand Liverpool or the situation in different regions of\nFrance following the events\nof last May.\nI would recommend\n\"Anything to Declare?\" not\njust from its entertainment\nstandard which is professional, but also for the opportunity to find out how\nyoung people from all over\nEurope are tackling sticky\nnational and international\nproblems with a new per-spec ti ve, and having great\nfun doing it!\nJan. 30th \u2014Feb. 22nd. Westminster Theatre,\nS.W.I. Student Rate : 5/-GEOFFREY CRAIG\nSaga PSY 30002\nThe Ginsbergs a* the ICV\nAllen Ginsberg is one of\nthe leading poets to emerge\nfrom the Beat Generation\nand is well known in this\ncountry. His father, Louis,\nis the other Ginsberg on this\nrecord. Louis has been writing poetry since World War\none, and is a notable poet\nin his own right. His work\nhas been published in the\nTimes and the New Statesman, and is a member of the\nBoard of Trustees of the\nPoetry Society of America.\nThis recording was made at\nthe ICA during their visit to\nthis country in 1967.\nAllen Ginsberg's works\nare long and rambling,\ndeclaimed with great vigour in an inimitable\nstyle. Allen's first piece is\nnot a poem, but an Invocation to Saraswati, Goddess\nof learning, poetry and\nmusic, a chant accompanied\nby himself on an accord ian, or something that sounds\nlike an accord ian. There\nfollows \" Iron Horse,\" a poem written on the train\nbetween San Francisco and\nChicago, then another (on\nthe bus between Chicago\nand New York, an a. ppen-dix), and last, a poem written on and about Wales. AH\nof these I enjoyed.\nI think that enjoyment of\nLouis Ginsberg's work must\ncome more easily to many\npeople \u2014 his short, controlled poems have more in\ncommon with the poetry one\nheard when younger than\nwith his son's. Louis Ginsberg's poetry is enjoyable in\na different way altogether.\nThe difference is that of a generation which changed\nthe face of poetry.\nWhat struck me most was\nthe respect of father and son\nfor each other ; despite large\nand manifest differences not\nonly of age, but of belief,\nopinion and outlook. The\nunderstanding a toleration\nof one for the other shows\nthem friends, as father and\nson rarely are. For this,\nalmost as much as for the\npoetry, I found this a delightful album.\nElektra EKSN 45051\nApricot Brandy\u2014\nRhinoceros\nThe musical press has\nbeen full of stories of musicians from different groups\ngetting together to play,\nand the imminent demise of\ngroups as we know them.\nRhinocerous is one of the\nnew-style groups. \" ApriFELIX 22 January 1969 .[\ncot Brandy \" is an in s tru mental, and after what we\nhad been told to expect, it\nis hard to become very excited about it.

Fred Neil actually\nwrote the song, and here, at\nlast, released as a single,\nis his rendering.\nFred Neil's voice grows\non one with exposure,\nand I like these songs\nmuch more than I did at\nthe time of our previous re-view. The voice particularly carries \" The Water is\nWide.\"\nICI will be selecting...\nabout 500 un blinkered graduates from British Universities in 1969.
