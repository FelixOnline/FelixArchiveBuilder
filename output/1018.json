    "content": "Feature\n^^rf d ventures Burkina Faso is a landlocked country of West\nAfrica, swept by the hot harm at tan winds and\na spirit of uncertainty. The national language\nis French, a legacy of Burkina Faso's past as a French territory until independence in 1960.\nSix coups and two changes of constitution\nsince then have not helped economic stability,\nand this, plus unrelenting drought, has made\nBurkina one of the poorest countries in West\nAfrica.\nThe capital, Ouagadougou, is an\nimportant centre for aid distribution in West\nAfrica, but ninety percent of the population\nlive in villages scattered around the river\nVolta and up to the Saharan borders. Iain\nTromans (pictured on rock), Steven Patterson\n(pictured in hat) and Peter Lo, all members of\nImperial's Christian Union, spent a month\ntravelling around Burkina Faso at the end of\nthe rainy season in September 1994.\n\"I worked all summer in a pizza place\nfor \u00a31.80 an hour,\" said Steven, explaining\nhow the project had been financed. \"Then I blew it all on going to Africa. The boss hired\nme because I came from Imperial. He said he liked to take on\nImperial people and torture\nthem because he wasn't accepted here to do a PhD\".\nThe original initiative\ncame from Iain, who spent three\nmonths in West Africa before\ncoming to London. His project\nwas run by a missionary society\nwhich at the time was developing a five year plan for\ntackling some of the economic\nproblems of the region. In the\nspirit of ventures like Cafe\nDirect (fair-trade coffee, now\navailable in Sainsbury's), the\nsociety exports local crafts to\nBritain, returning all the profits\nto Burkina Faso.\n\"It was very green when\nwe were there, but that was\nunusual,\" recalled Steven.\n\"September is the very end of\nthe rainy season, but we had\nquite a few wet days and people\nwere very pleased\". \"Except if\nthey had to travel long dis-t ances, like us,\" continued Iain.\n\"Flash floods took the roads\naway, and we had to make an\nFELIX2 UI H19580 km diversion\".\nSpeaking French was no\ntrouble for Iain and Peter, but\nmore of a challenge for Steven:\n\"It was a bit frustrating, but it\ngot better because I decided to go for it and\njust make mistakes\". The three's main role in\nBurkina was to travel to different villages, set\nup sound equipment and play the Christian\nmessage in local languages to the people. Less\nconfrontational than other approaches, the\nmethod seemed to go down well:\n\"When we went to villages with the\ntapes, people would sit and listen for half a hour and give us Tuareg tea and milk and\nthings\", said Steven. \"In fact they said 'This is\ngood because we don't have very many ways of\nfinding out about God'\". \"People aren't encumbered by all the wealth that we have in\nBritain,\" added Peter. \"They're very friendly\n- 1 liked them a lot\".\nNearly half of the Burkinabe (the people\nof Burkina) are Muslim. Another large\nproportion practise animism, or ancestor\nRebecca Mileham investigates\nwhy an Imperial College\nstudent should work for \u00a31.80\nan hour to get to Africa\n\u2014 i WSSm\nworship. This means that they often accept\nthe Muslim god superficially: \"When the\nanimists leave their village, they feel they\nneed a bigger god who covers more. Once they\nmeet someone telling them about a god over\neverything, they're very open to it\", said Iain.\n\"It's the same at Imperial,\" went on Steven.\n\"One of the Muslims gave me a sticker which\nsaid 'Play It Safe: Become A Muslim'\".\nTrying to convert already religious\npeople from one set of beliefs to another may\nseem pointless or egotistical. The three lads\nbelieve that they had better motives. \"Islam\ndoesn't answer the basic need to humanity\"\nsaid Steven, quietly. \"We need a relationship\nwith God, not just a set of rules and\nregulations\". Said Iain: \"The Muslims in\nBurkina put a very strong emphasis on the\noutward show of being a good Muslim. The\nAfricans even tried to make\nthemselves look as Arabic as\npossible by wearing long white\nrobes.\"\nAre the supposed\nconverts any more than 'rice\nChristians' though - who\naccept the beliefs on offer with\nan eye on the material rewards?\nSteven countered this: \"We\nfound that the people there\nwere so generous to us that we\nwere more like the rice\nChristians. They really gave us\nthe best of what they had\".\nIain felt that the efforts\nof the missionary society\nhaven't been imposed on\nBurkina, but are part of an\nongoing project which has\ngrown up within the country\nitself. While there are very few\nChristians, those that are there\nare very active. \"We went to\nBurkina with a professional\nfrom the society, but in\nOuagadougou we worked\nalongside a Burkinabe evangelism team,\" said Steven.\nAs if to prove that\nnothing you do is ever original,\n\n"

The test attempted to\ngauge what response was\nprovoked but although the\nnoise was said to be\n'un com for at bly loud' in the\ntraditional bar, no one went up\nto investigate. \"The punters\nwere sitting around looking a bit puzzled,\" said Ms Matthewman.

Members of\nthe Royal College of Science\nUnion (RCSU) look set to have\ntheir own vote on the question of\naffiliating to the national student\norganisation.\nFELIX has learnt that a motion is due to be submitted to\nthe next R CSU Union General\nMeeting( U GM) on 19th February, which will call for\nR CSU members to vote on\naffiliation to the NUS. If passed,\nthe RCSU Executive Committee\nwould be forced either to arrange\na referendum of union members\nor put the issue to aUG M. Imperial College Union( ICU) and its Constituent\nCollege Unions( CCUs) are\ncurrently among the small group\nof student unions who are not\naffiliated to the NUS. This is in\nkeeping wit h ICU's trend of\nremaining apolitical and hostile\nto affiliation with any politically\nactive organisations.\nUnder the new ICU constitution, it would be possible\nfor any of the CCUs to affiliate to\nthe NUS with a mandate from its\nmembers. However, the financial\nimplications of such a move\ncould come under severe\nopposition from both ICU and\nthe C CU.

    "content": "Standby\nStanding in a room facing Jeff\nBuckley. The extremities of my\nbody shake with music and\nemotion. He stares me in the eye\nas I mouth the lyrics of 'So Real'.\n\"I love you,\" he sings with a raised eyebrow , \"but I'm afraid\nto love you\" I return. What\nordinarily would be embarrassing\nis now a sublime communion. I give myself to the moment, I fall\ninto the role of fan, I gasp before\nmy idol. Jeff Buckley, twenty blue\nlight beams shooting from his\nbody to the ceiling above, drips\nwith sweat; his face contorts, he\nhatchets out the words from the\nmicrophone and for me he\nsummons the devil.\nHe had begun our reverie\nonly at the end of a chain of\nconfusions. Firstly, a half an hour\nwait twix t Bettie Serveert and the\nroadie s leaving the stage. The\naudience was noisy and pushed\nme ever closer to the front. Before\nme three fifteen year old girls\nclutched their hands to their\nchests. Behind me two fifty year\nold men noisily prepared to\nbootleg the gig. Frustration\nwelled up: had I forgotten my\ncares, stresses and readied myself\nfor this? To have my face beached\nin cigarette smoke and my legs\ncontorted like a ballerina to avoid\nthe wrong signals being sent by\nthe right parts of my body that\ntouched those of another? I'm a bad indie-kid; I get self-conscious\nand I never dance.\nAfter two false alarms three\npale, attractive men filed onto the\nstage. Everyone clapped and at\nthe back they obviously thought\nBuckley had arrived. (Later a universal truth). I was very close\nbut still confused - mistakenly\nthinking Jeff the sole guitarist in\nthe line up (with a bass and\ndrummer) I tried to snatch a look\nat the faces for a moment longer.\nThey all had the same hair as Jeff,\nall the same height but none\nseemed right. (And yes, I have\nseen his face before but my\nadmiration is not one of brain-burning lust - not really and\ncertainly not then - and at that\nmoment I lacked the confidence\nto be certain of his features). But\nat last, after twenty seconds of\nthis confusion, enters the king.\nHe wore a checked and long\ns leaved shirt over a white v cut Tshirt, rooted in blue jeans. His\nhair was cut to the short male-model mode worn by the rest of\nthe band. He seemed more like\nan embarrassed goofy friend as\nhe moved toward the microphone\n- quick steps as he pulled his\nguitar over his head, a giggle and\nan indecipherable mutter as he\n^ And there were giants on\nthe earth in those days,\nand after that\nsnagged on something, then a big\nsmile to the audience.\nImmediately noticeable was the\nspot that picked him out from the\nothers. They stood around in\nmotionless darkness, illuminating\nBuckley as an almost messianic\nfigure flanked by his disciples.\nAlthough later he introduced\nthem by name, and fine players\nthey were all, they were largely\nunimportant except as props. Jeff\nheld the stage.\nHe opened and too soon the\nfirst song was underway. And\nbegan a night long battle of\nequals, with the microphone and\nhimself, taunting and testing his\nown prowess and quickly gaining\nfull mastery of his five octaves,\nraising his voice at will from the\nsoft pander of lullaby to full-throated battle cry. His guitar\nadded music in sympathy and\nseemed almost as free as his\nlyrics - although no guitar hero in\nthe sense of wild solos or rampant\nfeedback, his mastery of tempo,\ntiming and improvisation is\nsomething I 've never seen before.\nHe brings to the live performance\nthe fluency of a jamming session\nwhere traditionally the best ideas\nare lost. The songs are familiar,\nmost taken from the debut album,\nand yet it is that same music\npossessed and wilful, strutting\nand soaring on its own vivacity.\nHe quickly arrives at 'Last\nGoodbye' and this personal\nfavourite becomes a searing\nlament, with Buckley apparently\ncalling up the memory of every\nlove he's ever waved away in an\nunbearably romantic and visible\nrendition. So my soul is already\nwith him as we reach 'Eternal\nLife'. This Robert Plantian howl,\nwith Buckley alternately swooping\nfrom philosopher to contemptuous yet humanistic atheist is\ntonight made to seem like the\nbest heavy metal song yet written.\nIt begins this time with him crying\na long monotonic cut-and-paste\nof the lyrics, unaccompanied by\nany other noise. Then the guitars\nslam in, the jaunty rhythm of the\nalbum version replaced by a new\njudd e ring, evil war-anthem. But\nas Buckley negotiates \"racist\neveryman, what have you done?\"\nthe guitar fails him - he throws it\non the floor in a fury. It's a revealing edit:\n\" Damn, damn, damn, a Japanese model l And it was\ngoing so well tool\". The audience\nare sympathetic yet Buckley\nmimics his recent press, saying: \"I just want it to be good for you to\"\nand \"Me, the spoiled brat, me me\nme!\" But of course he is spoiled,\nin that his talents are so\nprodigious that after what he\nhimself describes as a premature-ejaculation he can start the\nderanged rendition again and\nonce more carry us away.\nAfter this mind-blowing\nperformance he can take us\nanywhere and does. On 'Mojo\nPin' he inserts random stream-of-thought interludes. \"It's not a needle, it's not a bottle, it's not\nyou and not her\" he harries down\nthe mic. He covers some favourite\nwhich I should know but don't, only know that Buckley's performance of it, a bluesy\norchestration which has him\ncontrol the drummer with his left\nhand, occasionally playing a chord with his right and sounding\nlike the lost daughter of Billie\nHoliday, has instantly propelled it\nto genius. Finally he says\n\"goodnight\" only to change his\nmind and play his encore. \"So I'm your jukebox?\" he asks the crowd,\nnot just in jest, but he gives them\n'Hallelujah' anyway and you\ncould hear a pin drop. I have\nstupid urges; to hold a lighter in\nthe air or to fall out and back into\nlove just to better relate to the\nman on the stage. The words ring\ntrue.\nHe leaves and most can't believe he will return - some that\nhe can't even attempt to follow\nthat classic. But for once I clap my\nlittle morse code with the rest: \" CO-ME BACK JEFF\" After\nsome long and suspended\nminutes, to a mind that seems\nalmost post-coital, he does. I wonder behind my lop-sided grin\nwhat he will do - another cover or\na cigarette, a new number or a shower? But he takes that guitar\nand leads a chiming guitar swirl,\nthe first three minutes of which is\na subtly changing loop of melody,\nrepeated over and over until you\nwant to stamp your feet and shout\n\"yes, yes, YES!\" Then the words\nsay their thing, then the guitar\nchorus is back and I don't know\nwhat he's saying, just revel in my\nplace in the storm.\nAfter a period of time it is\nover and I leave, walking dazed\ndown the street like a drug-fucked\nrunaway.\nEarn \u00a3 4 - \u00a3 5 an hour!

With safe\ndrinking water available to only half the\npopulation, gastrointestinal disease and\nmalaria are the main causes of death, while\nleprosy, meningitis and worms are also\ncommon. \"We were really more involved in the spiritual aspects of things, but we were\nable to build some water storage barrels,\"\nexplained Peter. \"We painted them inside and\nout and so the village can store water in them.\"\n\"Medical things are hard to get hold of\nand they're very expensive,\" he went on. \"It's quite easy to get ill out there\". The missionaries themselves weren't immune. \"I got very sick after two weeks,\" said Steven. \"I think it was amoebic dysentery - I was\npassing blood and mucus on the hour every\nfeature\nhour for about a week. In the end I lost half a stone\". Steven described his luck that a doctor\nfrom another missionary organisation had\ngiven him a course of antibiotics. In\nOuagadougou there is a local hospital, but as\nSteven explained: \" You don't want to go to\nthe hospital unless you want to get very ill.\nYou'd certainly be wise to bring your own\nsyringes\".\nOnly a tenth of Burkina's land is arable,\non which must be grown the food crops of\nsorghum (a grassy crop like sugar cane),\nmillet, corn, rice and sweet potatoes. \"One of\nthe things that struck us was that they don't have the extraordinarily wide diet that we\nhave. We take for granted the variety of foods\nthat are available,\" said Iain, adding \"It's not\nso much that they don't have enough to eat,\nit's more malnutrition\".\n\"Most of our meals were rice and\nsauce,\" explained Steven. \"They don't have\nmuch meat, but we went to a village outside\nOuagadougou and the church there gave us\nmeat almost every meal. At the end they gave\nus three chickens. Even though they had so\nlittle they were so generous\". Culinary customs turned out to be slightly different,\nhowever: \"They cooked the whole chicken,\nfeet, head, everything. We... er... didn't eat the\nhead,\" confessed Steven.\nThe three flew to Africa with the\nRussian airline Aeroflot, giving them the\nchance to spend three days in Moscow on\ntheir way home. \" The Russian orthodox\nchurches are very different\", said Steven.\n\"There was this haunting, beautiful music and\nthe high priest in his hat.

Being 11\nyears old and receiving such a distinct name from the others i^ a, Faith becomes obsessed with\nmeeting this person.\nYears later Faith is in her mid\ntwenties and is just about to get\nmarried to a podiatrist (foot doctor).\nSuddenly out of nowhere Damon\nBradley telephones saying he is\nunable to attend the wedding since\nhe flying off to Venice. Faith,\ndetermined to get one glimpse of\nthe man with the right name,\nimpulsively flies to Italy. There she\nends up meeting Peter Wright\n(Robert Downey Jr) and he falls\nmadly in love with her. Still\ndesperate, Faith travels around\nItaly following Bradley's tracks, with\nPeter in tow like a love sick dog.\nUndaunted by Faith's own agenda,\nPeter follows Faith using all his\nenergy to express his love for her.\nThroughout the film there are\nscenes that make you cringe, and\nwant to hide behind a big sign of\nsensibility. They are excruciatingly\nsilly but definitely romantic. With\nre-enactments of 'Casablanca' and\n'Roman Holiday' the film has an\nold fashion love theme. It has\ntouches of a fairy tale with Peter\nand Faith meeting up when she\nhappens to loose a shoe. So from a podiatrist to a shoe salem an, Faith\nlives the Cinderella story, while\ntravelling around Italy, in search for\nher destined love.\nMarisa Tomei and Robert\nDowney Jr have both received\nacademy awards for their acting\nskills. Tomei received hers for 'My\nCousin Vinny' and while Downey Jr\nreceived a British academy award\nfor the film 'Chaplin'. At first they\nseem an odd pair to mix but as the\nfilm progresses you start to\nappreciate their characters as star\ncrossed lovers. 'Only you' may not\nbe a film that has a loved one\nbursting into sentimental tears but\nthere are plenty of starlit Italian\nnights for all romanticists.\nThe story of la reine margot\ncentres on Catholics and the\nProtestants in sixteenth century\nFrance. Yes, it's another one of\nthose arty far ty films that people\nrarely bother going to see at the\ncinema. This is a shame as 'La\nReine Margot' is very entertaining.\nThe plot revolves around the\nroyal family; an intriguingly odd set\nof characters which includes a ruthless queen, Catherine de\nMedici and her three sons who, as\ns ambiguously suggested in the\nfilm, have a dod gy incestuous\nrelationship with their sister\nMargot.\n'La Reine Margot' is a violent\nfilm; Catherine de Medici wants to\nreconcile the French, and in an\nattempt to do so, she orders all\nProtestants to be killed. This results\nin much blood spilling during what\nbecame known as the Saint\nBartholomew's Day Massacre.\nHowever, Catherine's attempt to\nkill Margot's husband with a poisoned hunting book (\"the pages\nare stuck together; one needs to\nlick one's fingers to turn them\")\nfails; the book ends up in the hands\nof her eldest son, Charles IX. The\neffects of the poison are slow and\nagonising, resulting in some rather\ngruesome scenes where Charles IX\nis seen sweating blood.\nBut, 'La Reine Margot' is also a ove story; Margot falls in love with\na young man who, because he is a Protestant must be killed.\nAdmittedly, this will perhaps be\nenjoyed more by the arty far ty type\nm of cinema goer but even so, if you\nU fancy a change to the usual\nmainstream stuff, 'La Reine Margot'\ncomes highly recommended.

The project matches each Jewish\nSociety in the country, and each registered\nstudent, with a Holocaust victim and we are\nall going to learn about our community in\norder to preserve their memory. The decision\nwas taken that rather than just reflect backwards upon their death, we should improve\nourselves and our knowledge to further dissipate the effect Hitler had upon us and move\nforwards for the future. This project will last\nfor fifty days, from Wednesday 25th January,\nand there are books and information packs\navailable on request to those who are not\nalready members. During this period there\nwill be events running concurrently at every\nJewish society in the country, such as\nHolocaust survivors coming to talk, evenings\nof learning, films, theatre trips and exhibitions. It culminates in Purim, on March 17th, which was the Biblical date used by Haman, a prince of Persia, to try to eradicate the Jewish\npeople and he too did not succeed. On this\nday there is much partying and rejoicing, as\nthere will be this year too. More details nearer the time.

Keys: Carbon Monoxide, Death Carbon monoxide poisoning from faulty gas\nheaters poses a real threat to us all. Approximately 35 deaths occur in this way\nevery year and students are often the victims.\nCarbon monoxide is difficult to detect as\nit cannot be seen and does not necessarily\nsmell. However, there are a few danger signs\nto look out for, such as stains at the top of a gas heater or a yellow/orange flame. The best\nway of ensuring your appliance is safe is to\nhave it checked by a qualified person\n(CORGI registered).\nThe good news is that since 31st October, 1994, landlords/ladies have a legal\nresponsibility to ensure that gas appliances\nare checked every 12 months. They have to\nkeep an inspection record which must be\nmade available to students. A gas safety\naction line has been set up to provide information. They can be contacted by phoning\n0800 300 363.\nAll in all, these changes may help students to\nprotect themselves. If you are in any doubt, you\ncan seek advice from the Union Adviser.\nJ.

So witness as I, your good\nFrater, lay down my sacred knives\nand needles to instead draw out\nsome spiritual blood, lest my\ngenuine flow should cause\nuntoward s que am to my delicate\nreaders. And what of his life, you\nmay ask? Well, my friends, the\nrobes and wands have been laid\ndown as ritual ising takes a more\ninner form. I have turned once\nmore to the jewels of\nunderstanding hidden within the\nancient texts. All is peaceful and\nintrospective, the macro cosmos having to take a well earned\nsecond place. And yet it seems that\nthe world is in an unholy turmoil!\nAn associate of mine (the\nmore astute among you may have\ndeduced by now that your Frater\nhas only accomplices, acquaintances and associates) tried hard to\nconvince me that one should care\nequally for all humans, regardless\nof familial or geographical ties.\nThough he argued soundly I find it\ndifficult to realise his ideals, and\nfeel that they must be flawed; for\neven your sincere FF (rugged cynic\nthough he is) is more shocked by\nharm caused to those close, than\nto those afar. It seems that such\nharm may necessarily cause\npersonal pain due to the effect it\nhas on the brain. Each person, and\nindeed each concept, is connected\nwithin the mind to countless others\nin the form of an 'association al network'. Damage to someone\nclose will affect that person's network. And thus, by the endless\nweb of memorial connections, does\nthe knowledge of the relative's pain afflict the whole of the brain,\nand thus all of emotion. Even the\ngreatest of idealists cannot deny\nthe relevance of damage to his\nown mental structure, the\nwounding of his micro cosmos. Such facts were brought to\nmy awareness by events of afar.\nWhen a distant land is rent apart\nthe news mongers bring us\ngratuitous images for our sordid\ntitillation. However those self same\nimages can also bring the world\ncloser, and one can discover that\nassociates are not neighbours, but\nmay inhabit unknown spaces. In\nthese instant times, such friends\nmay inhabit the other side of the\nworld; yet'they seem as near and\nthe damage becomes genuinely,\nfor a shocking moment at least, as\nclose as that.\nPOLITICAL SCIENCE Science has been called a religion.\nIt is claimed that it has a priesthood, cabal is tic knowledge\nand provides objective truth. While\nI agree with the first two\n(priesthood = scientists, cabal is tic knowledge=theorems), there is a problem in that science does not,\nin fact, produce objective truth. For\nnon-believers, agnostics and\npriests to call Science a religion is,\ntherefore, wrong.\nThe attack on the claim that\nScience produces objective truth is\ntwo-fold. For the word \"objective\"\nwe can inspect the more\npolitical/ideological aspects of\nScience. It is doubtful, especially in\ntechnology and especially when\nScience means funding of millions\nof pounds, that there is not an\nagenda or a motive. The battle\nmay be purely political (American\nvs Soviet Science) or personal (the\nfame of being the first to discover\nX). Where the agenda is hidden,\nthe objectivity is suspect.\nMore concrete criticisms can\nbe made of the word \"truth\". An\nidea, a fact, is truthful if it always\nholds, whatever the case. But\nScience - essentially we are talking\nabout experimental science - can\nonly come up with theories via\nInduction: Because A holds in all\ncurrently known situations, a Scientist assumes that A is true.\nBut this is not the case.\nConsider the trivial but illuminating\ncase of the Inductivist Turkey. At\nthe start of the year the Turkey was\nfed every morning. This happened\nunder all conditions: on Tuesdays;\nwhen it was sunny; whether young\ncalves were flown to France or not.\nSo the Turkey concluded that it\nmust be true that he would be fed\nevery morning. This theorem was\ntrue, until the morning of the 25th of December...\nInduction is largely the only\ntool at a Scientists disposal. (At\nleast, that is what all Scientists are\nbrought up with.) But Induction can\nonly come up with Provisional\nTruth. (There are other problems\nwith Induction as well, such as the\nuncomfortable notion that\nInduction as a scientific method\ncan only be proven by Induction\nitself.)\nWhile philosophers of\nscience have gone on from\nInduction as a method towards, for\nexample, Popper's Conjectures and\nRefutations or Lakatos' Proofs and\nRefutations, the \"priests\" of the\n\"religion\" called Science still\npractice tricks. This should be\nobvious to both priests and masses\nalike: Science does not produce\nobjective truth; Science is not a religion.\nSamin\nFurther Reading:\nOn the objectivity of Science:\nLewonfin, Biology as Ideology: the\nDoctrine of DNA.

And so let's learn to enjoy the luxury ...(MONDO UOMO\nJan '95).\nMen's fashion is set to take the market by storm. At long last, with\nthe shattering of the plethora of male costume taboos, colour, shape,\ncut and form are back in style for men. And above all else, materials\nhave become deeper, richer and altogether more self indulgent than\never before. After decades of being boxed into a standard shape and\nstyle, the first off the mark to individuality will be the winner. Faux-fur is\namong the strongest influences - outside on hats and bomber jackets,\nor inside lining fur-collared cashmere overcoats. As ever, Gianni\nVersace exhibited the ultimate expression of grandeur - throwing mink\nstoles carelessly over the shoulder in opulent replacement of the scarf or\ncable knit sweater.\nPaul Smith is back at the top, having produced the most eye\ncatching style in the Barcelona shows. From cigarette pant suits with\nnarrow high necked (absolutely wicked) jackets to a rainbow of colours\nin chenille or ribbed cotton pullovers, his collections took the forefront\nof style back from the sti list i of Italy to our inner-city streets.\nAs ever my favourites, Dolce and Gabanna, couple striking\noriginality with polished style - introducing trousers so ample they\nalmost resemble a skirt, worn with close fitting v neck ribbed jumpers\nand distinguished by the usual D& G touch of class. Alternatively, choose\ngauze or georgette fabric for the shirt (particularly nice), with loose\ntrousers gathered at the waist -think back to what your girl-friends were\nwearing last year- and with the arrival of the male navel remember as\nwell the number of sit-ups and the amount of breathing in they had to\ndo each day. Come on guys, we'll be looking out for those building\nblocks in your stomach! 0\nin a sea of their own\nThe best description I 've read of\nbet tie serve ert is that they sound\nlike a life slowly coming together or\nslowly falling apart. Sometimes it's so hard to tell the difference.\nCertainly a cursory listen to their\nnew album, lamprey could result in\nsome disturbing thoughts. The first\ntrack, 'Keepsake' digs in deep with\na haunting intro which transmutes\nmoodily with the words, \"pondering\nendlessly our mistakes just for\nkeepsake\". Even the sweet rising\nmelodies of the following 'Ray Ray\nRain' conceal more that their share\nof wistfulness; \"time and time it\nseems, we're always somewhere\ninbetween\". But that's not to label\nBettie Serveert as the dutch chapter\nof the Smiths' depredation society.\nMelancholia isn't necessarily sad.\nMore often 'Lamprey's' twisting\npassage brings us back to some\neventual uplifting hope.\nPerhaps this is best displayed\nin the triptych made up of\n'Cybor*D', 'Tell Me Sad', and the\ncurrent single, 'Crutches'. The\ndoubt contained within the latter's\"I'm never sure what goes on\ninside\" is overbalanced by a delicious Come inspired riff. 'Tell\nme sad' eases in on the back of\n\"rocking horse people out on a limb\" but despite all the obvious\nhook ins, lead singer Carol van\nDijk's voice never approaches\ndespair.\nTo sum them up? Well\n'Cybor'D's' call, \"if we only had the\ncourtesy to see it through\" is\npeculiar edge for a love song to\ntake but it's all the more satisfying\nfor that. While Bettie Serveert sail\nthe same emotional storms as the\nrest of us but they do it in a boat of\ntheir own unique construction. (7)\n\"Welcome to our showcase\",\nsaid Tanya before breaking into the\nfirst new song of the belly set.\nChugga, chug ga, it sounded like\nthe first ten seconds of Status Quo.\nAnother new one seemed to\nrevolve around the line \"I guess I can't fake it, I want to see you\nnaked\". What about all those\nacerbic ally poised lyrics from their\nlast album, 'Star'? Behind the\ngrowing ranks of mindless paid-to-mosher s, one reviewer was coming\nto an early conclusion that this was\nnot going to be one of his better\nexperiences.\nFirst blame was firmly placed\non Gail the bassist. I mean she's done most of her plucking in no\nhope hardcore bands. Tonight she\nwas in ripped vest mode, complete\nwith an arm cast the size of\nnebraska which had 'kook'\nscrawled on it. Gail also has lips\nthat snarl like Steve Tyler.\nUnder attack from songs they\nactually knew the ze bee dee crew\ndown the front could hardly contain\nthemselves. But it was true, even\nthe old numbers like 'Feed The\nTree', 'White Belly' and 'Dusted'\nhad a definitely heavier feel to\nthem. Tanya wasn't so much\nslipping through our wires as\nvenous ly twanging the strings of\nher strat and scraping the top of\nher range. So why did it all turn out\nright in the end?\nBecause three songs crashed\nin together. Maybe by this point\nBelly weren't straining, maybe they\njust liked playing these more,\nmaybe they're better songs, I don't know. But 'Now They'll Sleep',\n'John D 'Ark' and 'Red' subtracted\nmore that what had gone before. I take it back, Belly are as poised as\nthey ever where. Sure the ethereal\nedge that ran through 'Star' has\nbeen replaced by a more complex\nand confident muse but the same\nbreaking tsunami of emotion runs\nthroughout. The two song encore\nwas completed by a blistering 'Slow\nDog'. \"The kind of skin you can see\nthrough, she shot again\" - through\nthe heart, yeah.\nrosa mot a are one of the\nmultitude of bands that have been\nrecommended as a good listen so it\nwas with anticipation I that put on\ntheir new album wishful sinking.\nIt took about five minutes to\nfigure out that this was a concept\nalbum. Not perhaps in the sense of\n'Dark Side Of The Moon', but as an\nalbum it was definitely not just a collection of unconnected single\nmaterial.\nThere's a classic climatic intro-duct ion, cunningly called 'Thintro',\nwhich leads into three more not\ndissimilar songs, all sharing\ncommon themes, rhythm and guitar\nstyles. Most of the songs have no\nreal structure, and while there is a continuation of themes, they really\naren't good enough to sustain this\nkind of power chord bashing.\nAs an album this is a real flop,\nwith no memorable songs, no\nsensitivity and no change in\nexpression or direction.

This may not stay the\nsame for long as the Union\nPresident intends to destroy this\narea of student representation\nmaking it more professionally run.\nIt is thought that this is already the\ncase, incorrectly so, by some\npeople, after being misled at the\nlast Union Council Meeting. It\nseems that we are on the way to\nlosing a Student Officer with no\none realising - or possibly even\ncaring?

To gain the answers to these and many other\nquestions, off I toddled, Dictaphone in hand, to the dizzy\nheights and saucy delights of the Palace of Westminster.\nEvolution of the present system\nA Constitution is:\nThe system of\nlaws, customs\nand conventions\nwhich define the\ncomposition and\npowers of\norgans of state,\nand regulate the\nrelations of the\nvarious state\norgans to one\nanother and to\nthe private\ncitizen\nThe origins of political power in the United\nKingdom can be traced back to the Norman\nconquest. In times to follow, all powerful\nEnglish Kings took council from the\n'Witengamot'. This was a small body of\nEngland's noblest men, whose task was to\nassist the King in his decision making. It was\nthen superseded by the Anglo Norman 'Magnum Concilium'. From these ancient\nfoundations, evolved the British System of\nrule, that we know today. The turning point\nwhich lead to a largely elected, liberal\ndemocracy, was the Great Reform Act of\n1832.\nThe uncodified and evolutionary\nnature of the British constitution can be best\nexplained by consideration of the past\nthousand years of English, and subsequently\nBritish history. Not once over this very long\nperiod of time have the British ever had to sit\ndown under the pressure of military defeat\nfrom another nation, and 'thrash out' a constitution from first principles.\nFurthermore, the only interruption of the\nCrown's rule over the British people was due\nto the Glorious Revolution of 1688. However,\nthe monarchy was reinstated by the Act of\nSettlement in 1701, and to this day its reign\nhas remained unbroken.\ne sent system\nopel es sly impossible to date the British: ion. This is due to the fact that it is a jumble of\n:n conventions and written laws, all inbred at\nit moments of history. The present British: ion is epi tomis ed by 'The Mace'. The Mace in form is a silver staff situated in the House of\nCommons. It represents the fundamental principal that\nthe authority and power in the United Kingdom rests\nwith the Crown in Parliament. It is for this reason that\nthe sovereign power of the UK is often referred to as the\nQueen-in-Parliament.\nThrough this central axiom, no group or individual\nmay challenge a decision made by the Prime Minister\nwith Cabinet, endorsed by an Act of Parliament which\nreceives the Queen's seal of approval. Thus we indeed\nhave an extremely powerful Executive, who have\ncomplete control over a flexible, uncodified and arguably\nunwritten constitution. Some might say that this\nsituation has led to an elected dictatorship. In stark\ncontrast to this, the American system is such that its\nexecutive, legislative and judiciary are theoretically\nindependent. Ideally, this provides checks so that no one;\ninstitution can impose its will on another. Where as in\nBritain, Parliament is deemed sovereign; the judiciary\nhas no authority to overrule Acts of Parliament.\nInvariably the government has a highly disciplined\nmajority, allowing it to force the majority of legislation\nwithout question. Therefore, the government is the final\narbiter of its own powers. Being in a democracy,\nultimately the electorate is sovereign, assuming of course\nthat one agrees with the present electoral system, and that\nyou believe we do live in a democracy.\nThe reformers\nAt the cutting edge for constitutional reform is Charter\n88. But there are also many more supporters for their\ncause. Unsurprisingly, Her Majesty's opposition in Parliament are also very strong supporters for sizeable\nconstitutional reform. A single leading voice in the\nreforming pack is Mr Tony Benn MP. He had his\n'Commonwealth of Britain Bill' introduced to the House\nof Commons on 17th May, 1991. The broad aims of\nwhich are:;\n1. A written constitution, which embodies a citizens\n'Charter of Rights'.\n2 The establishing of ;i'i lom mission er of Human\nRights'.\n3. The establishing of a High Court, independent of\nLegislature and Executive.\n4. To have two Houses of Parliament, democratically\nelected.\n5. Abolition of the Monarchy, and in its place an\nelected President.\n6. The d is establishment of the Church of England, and\nthe abolition of the blasphemy offence.\n7. Voting age reduced to 16.\n8. Commonwealth Parliament Acts to take precedence\nover EC law.\n9. Enforcement of equal proportions of men and women\nin Parliament.\n10. Accountable security services.\nI was fortunate enough to be able to talk to the most\nhonourable Mr Benn on the telephone, very early, one\nMonday morning. I asked him to sum up in one sentence\nFELiX HU finS S Feature\nwhy we needed a Commonwealth of Britain. His reply\nwas quite simply;\n\"The short answer is that we don't have a democracy.\nWhy are we not allowed to elect both houses of Parliament\ndemocratically? Why do we have a nationalised church?\"\nIn response to my asking him what was wrong with\nthe House of Lords he replied;\n\"Well, why do we need a House of Commons?... Why\ndon't we just leave it to the King to govern the country?... The\nreason that democracy matters is that if you can't overrule the\npeople that govern, then they '11 never listen to you \".\nI then suggested to him that the Lords have a unique wealth of experience.\n\"Well lots of people have a wealth of experience. You\ncan stop the first hundred people you meet in the street, or get\nthe national lottery to pick the hou st \u2022' Lords, you '</ get a very\nbroadly based range of experience\".\nWords spoken in jest, perhaps? But I think they\nhighlight the rather unique position of the Lords amongst world democracies.\nI asked Mr Benn whether he thought that the\nabolition of the Crov\\n m^g ht erode the British national\nidentity.\n'Well it's up to you whether you take your national\nidentity to be that way, but the powers of the Crown go towards\nselection of the Prime Minister, the Judiciary, the\nArchbishops... that's the problem, the Crown powers... it's nothing to do with the royal family, they just happen to be there'\nOne recurring theme throughout his bill was the\npromotion of an artificially maintained representation of\nwomen in the new Parliament - 50% men, 50% women.\nHis reasons for this were:\n\"that there were more women than men in the country,\nand fewer women than men in the House of Commons... why\nshouldn't we have gender equality. This then gets rid of the silly\nidea that men are competing with women...as I think that the\ncompetition between men and woman causes a great deal of\ntension.\"\nThe next thing that I turned to was the issue as to\nwhether government was to secretive and unaccountable.\n'We not only have secretive government, but a secretive\nParliament. I'm just about to be thrown off the privileges\ncommittee for reporting what's going on there [he subsequently\nwas J. For example if you take the book written by Peter\nWright, 'Spycatcher', saying he'd tried to undermine the British\ngovernment, and they [the government] spent millions of\npounds making sure that we never read the book. ...when Oliver\nNorth said he'd disobeyed the president it all came out in a congressional hearing, and was held in the open for months and\nmonths... Knowledge is power, and nobody in power wants\nanyone else to know what's going on.\"\nI asked for his thoughts on the state of independence of the three main branches of officialdom\nthat form the constitution - the Legislature, Executive\nand Judiciary? His response was;\n\"...the British Constitution is a strange one, because the\nLord Chancellor is the ChiefJustice [responsible for making\njudicial appointments], the speaker of the House of Lords and\nalso a member of the executive, in cabinet...so it is a totally\nintegrated system.\"\nCommenting on his Bill, Mr Benn said;\n\"[I haven't] tried to completely recast it [the\nconstitution] on the American model, because we are\ntraditionally within this particular system. And it could be\nmade more democratic without fundamental changes... but I think Scottish, Welsh and English Parliaments, and a federal\nelected second chamber... will p \u2022 b 'Ay clear up most of the\nproblems.\"\nis there need for constitutional reform?\nI think it is fair to say that iur in gr ru ule in times, the\nBritish citizen has lived as free a life as any other person.\nIn i'e~< j st it ut ional system in Great Britain has\nlasted for over 300 years without a break, revolution or\ncivil war. This is a record of stability unmatched by any\nother nation, ever. In my opinion it is a testimony to the\nBritish constitution and system of government that the\nClerk of the House of commons has set up an office whose\npurpose is solely to deal in offering advice to requesting\nforeign nations, on how they might best go about\noperating a parliamentary system. The evolved living\norganism which the British constitution surely is, has\nprocured flexible and powerful government, balanced by\nmoderation and trustworthiness in the executive.\nParliament is so strong, that no parliament may bind its\nsuccessors. Here, in my opinion, lies the true genius of\nConsiae: for one moment the position of women,\nethnic ~ ' - . -i*.mo sexual s if we had a written\n-. ;t_ \u00bbic ii some Utopian rock. A Bill of\nRights would impose; the 'founder generations beliefs'\nupon all future generations. Examples of this are the\nGerman constitution with its prohibition on the use of\nGerman troops abroad (enacted in1949), the Irish\nconstitution with its claim to sovereignty over Ulster\n(enacted in1937), and the 2nd Article of the American\nconstitution enshrining 'the ng kl to bear and carry arms'.\nThis last example most aptly demonstrates the absurd\ncircumstance currently occurring in America where the\nlevel of gun related crime has reached boiling point, and\nwhenever the 2nd article comes up for possible\namendment, the gun lobby ensure that all political hell\nbreaks loose.\nI myself am a passionate believer in the Crown, and\nall it stands for. I believe it gives the nation a sense of\nidentity in a world which is rapidly acquiring a global\nculture. However I would support some kind of reform of\nthe Royal Prerogative applied to ministers of the Crown.\nIt seems disgraceful to me that government ministers can\nclaim political and legal sanctuary in the name of the\nCrown, when things go wrong. I also agree with Tony\nBenn's idea that the church should be disestablished, as\nwe now live in a multi religious society. With regards to\nthe House of Lords, I see no problem. As long as there\ncontinues to be a fresh injection of life peers, i.e.a meritocracy, then I am sure that it will continue to be a debating chamber, whose quality of debate is unsurpassed\nby any other.\nIn truth, far from the constitutional structure being\non the point of collapse, I see it as being on the point of\nconsummation, with only the last few pieces to be put in\nplace. Do we have a constitutional crisis?\nI would like to offer my sincere thanks and\ngratitude to Alan Duncan MP, Tony Benn MP and Tariq\nDajani of Charter 88. H MM\n\n"

It seems an argument\nbetween staff, a student and an\nex-student of Imperial in the\nHolland Club led to an assault on\nthe Queen's Lawn.\nThe incident occurred on\nFriday 16th December, the last\nday of term. It was brought to the\nattention of college authorities\nafter the girlfriend of one of\nthose involved reported the\nattack to college security. Two\nsecurity officers were dispatched\nand on arriving at the scene\nfound the injured. They were\nfound to have various cuts and\nlacerations.\nOn being accompanied back\nto the Holland Club, they were\nable to identify their alleged\nassailants who are due to appear\nin court on February 6th. Following these events, certain\ncollege sources have claimed that\nthree technicians have been\ndismissed and further suggested\nthat one of the technicians has\nstarted proceedings against the\nCollege for unfair dismissal.\nThe events on the Queen's Lawn seem a continuation of the\nspate of drink related incidents\nwhich have hit College recently.\nOthers include the arson attacks\nin Linstead Hall and violence in\nBeit Quad. Two weeks ago in a letter to FELIX, Lucy Chothia,\nICU President, called for clubs\nand societies to take more care\nover drink related activities.\nCollege authorities have also\nstressed the need for care.\nSpeaking to FELIX, Terry\nBriley, Deputy Head of Security,\nadvised licensees to 'tighten up\nrules' to avoid incidents\nattracting 'the unnecessary\nattention of police'.\nCampaign Manager for New Election\nBY ANDREW SMITH Imperial College Union Elections Committee have taken\nthe controversial decision of\nappointing a manager for this\nyear's New Election campaign.\n\u00a340 will be available in the\nupcoming elections to the\nmanager chosen to oppose those\nrunning for the four sabbatical\nposts.\nThe elections committee,\nannounced last week as: the\nDepartmental Representative of\nChemical Engineering, the\nPublications Board Chairman,\nthe RCS President, the RS M Academic Affairs Officer, the\nSCC Chair and chaired by the\nICU President, took the unusual\ndecision at its meeting this\nWednesday. This is in stark\ncontrast to last year's decision by\nAndrew Wensley, then ICU President, who even discouraged\na publicity campaign, the usual\npractice in previous years.\nEarlier Lucy Chothia, ICU President, had told Felix of her\npreference for merely a publicity\ncampaign, even going so far as to\noutline the dangers of appointing\na full campaign manager.\nWhile recognising that\nstudents always should have a choice, Ms Chothia emphasised\nthat a New Election campaign\ncould get out of control, with\npeople voting for it simply to\nexpress disgust of the Union, rather than of the particular\ncandidates.\n(continued on page two)\nB news one&two&three \u2022 ed l to rial& credits three \u2022 incoming five \u2022 the s files seven \u2022\nci u ed Up nine \u2022 feature: adventures in africa ten&eleven \u2022 feature: the british non cons it uti on twelve& thirteen \u2022 xtra curricular: extra slabs of hot c&s action! fourteen&fifteen&sixteen \u2022 feature: sabbatical election95 is underway seventeen \u2022 standby eighteen&n in teen& twenty&twenty one \u2022 seven day guide twenty&twenty one \u2022 sport twenty four B "

Fatalism? Blinkered\nfoolhardiness? Illusions of immortality?\nRebellion against societal conformity and\nparental authority? Thrill-seeking escape\nfrom suburban monotony? Testing the power\nof will over atavistic fears inherited from our\namoebic forebears (after all, evolution allows\nmost organisms to differentiate up from\ndown, and generally discourages rapid transitions between the two)? Hmmmm... a more\ndetailed profile of the IPC members was obviously called for.\nOne would be predisposed to presume\nthat in attendance at a club meeting would be\na large proportion of \"my cup run ne th over\nwith testosterone\" types in combat boots and\narmy greens.

The static line\ndescent from 2,000 ft was followed by subsidies for future jumps (conditional on your\nsurviving the first) such that \u00a311 would be\nthe toll on your wallet thereafter. No mention\nwas made of life insurance, or the drafting of\nwills to avoid the nasty state of in te stacy( don't worry - it's not catching). Reliance on\nPeterborough Parachute Centre having a Guinness Book of Records entry and the best\nsafety record in Britain (\"No fatalities yet\"\nthey boast) seemed insurance enough.\nHmmmm.\nWould it? What did a parachute jump\nREALLY involve? Could any fool/IC student\ndo it? What was it like to free fall for 4 sec-on ds? What did it take to pilot your own aircraft for 3 minutes - even if it looked like a distended jellyfish? Was it really better than\nsex? What's the answer to Life, the Universe\nand other trifles?\nFor answers to these questions, either\njoin and jump yourself (meetings in the Table\nTennis Room, third floor of the Union Building, Thursdays at 1pm) or wait with\nbaited breath for the next enthralling episode\nin our examination of the IC Parachute Club.\nRcagj\nWhere has Rag gone?

To stand for a post, you need to sign up on the\npapers which will be posted on the notice board opposite the Union Office in the Union Building. You need one person to\npropose you and twenty others to second you. Papers go up on Monday 6th February and come down on Friday 17th February at which point the campaigns begin. Now you know how to stand but what does it involve? Each of the current\nSabbaticals describes their job below. Whichever post you go for it will take energy enthusiasm and team work. You will\nhave some of the best times you have ever experienced, and you will also have days when absolutely every thing goes wrong.\nPresident If you become Union President what do you have to look forward to? Well\nyou are the ultimate representative of the Union, you are ultimately\nresponsible for the finances of the Union, you sit on 1 9 College\ncommittees, 1 6 Union Committees and what ever working parties either\nthe Union or College decide need to be formed. That is a very brief\nsummary of the Job Description but what do you really do?\nOK, this is hard. You spend a lot of time in committees some\nexciting some not so exciting but all important in one way or another.\nThese committees will range from Student Welfare to College Finances\nand including Governing body. In order to take an active role in these\ncommittees it is important to read the papers for the committee and arrive\nat the committee with some idea of the issues which are to be discussed.\nYou are responsible for the smooth running of the Union. This\nmeans anyone may contact you at any time of the day or night with a problem. Problems will range from reciprocal agreements to being told to\nleave College, from exams on a Wednesday afternoon to external\norganisations not recognising ICU cards.\nAs President you represent Imperial at the University of London\nUnion (more meetings). The Presidents of the Colleges which make up\nULU meet once a month to discuss problems of mutual interest and any\nUniversity of London Campaigns. You are also an IC representative at\nULU General Union Council (the equivalent of our Council) and the\nUniversity of London Academic Committee.\nThere are also large amounts of one-off jobs to do. These include\norganising Union training, allocating parking permits, interviewing for\nnew Union Staff, organising the Union's annual second handbook sales,\norganising Welfare Week, writing the Union's Constitution, writing to\nstudents spending a year in Europe and arranging the Sabbatical\nelections. All the Sabbaticals help out at Carnivals and the big Union\nevents. This will involve working behind the bar, stewarding or working on\nthe door. There are a lot of things I haven't mentioned but you may have\nthe idea by now being President is extremely varied. What I haven't mentioned is that you must work well with other people. Being a Sabbatical involves team work. It is an experience you will never have\nanother chance at. Don't miss it.

If you are thinking of something\nchallenging to do for the next 13 months then have you thought about\nbeing a sabbatical? Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) is a challenging\nand fulfilling role to take up in the Union. If elected, you will be\nresponsible for the following:\nOrganising BUSA sports; organising the Freshers' Fair ('95);\nrepresenting sports and societies to College, ULU, and other outside\norganisations; sorting out insurance payments; temporary membership;\noverseeing all the Clubs & Societies; internal room bookings; Union keys;\nnotice boards and poster regulations; e mail accounts; WWW pages.\nYou will also have to attend: Disciplinary meetings, Exec, Council,\nSub-Committee meetings, ULU sports meetings, Refectory Services and\nBookstore meetings, Union Finance Committee, College Athletics\nCommittee, South Kensington Users Group, BUSA meetings, College\nDisciplinary meetings, ULU GUC, BUSA conferences, ULU training and\nICU training.\nOn top of that you will be part of a team who look after the day to\nday management of the Union. Teamwork is very important in this job if\nyour year in the Union is going to be successful. You will find yourself\nmucking in around the office, helping out with carnivals, reception and\nhelping in a multitude of other incidents.\nSo now you know what goes into the job, why don't you run in the\nelections and have an interesting and stressful year. Ian Parish\nDeputy President( Finance& Services) So, you're thinking of becoming a Sabb? - come on, I know you are. See!\ncaught you red-handed reading the job descriptions! But what will you do\nif you are elected?\nUnion Finances:\nThe Deputy President (Finance & Services) is responsible to the President\nfor every aspect of the Union's \u00a32M turnover. Any item of expenditure or\nbudget over \u00a3500 must come to you for authorisation. A lot of your time\nwill be spent helping Clubs and Societies with any financial problems they\nmight have. You will also be responsible for organising and chairing the\nUnion Finance Committee. This is the body within the Union that makes\nall of the top level financial decisions.\nTrading Activities:\nAs Deputy President (Finance & Services) you are responsible for\noverseeing the running of the Traditional Bar, Da Vinci's, Bookstore and\nNewsagent. Policy decisions regarding the outlets are made at Refectory\nServices Committee and Bookstore Committee respectively. Again, you\nwill be responsible for organising and chairing of these meetings.\nOther Duties:\nYou will also be responsible for overseeing all of the other Union services,\ne.g. Minibus fleet, games machines, food machines etc. You will also be\nthe Union representative for accommodation which involves taking part in\nSubwarden and Warden interviews. As a Sabbatical you also represent\nthe Union in meetings at the highest level within College and ULU. But\nprobably the most important aspect of your job is that you must work with\nthe President and other Deputy President as a very close knit team at the\nhead of the Union.\nWell that is very briefly what my job entails, if you are interested please\nfeel free to pop into the Union Office for a chat. Dan Look\nFelix Editor& Print Unit Manager Why would anyone want this job? The thought trundled again and again\nthrough my mind. It was the second week of October and I was into my\nsecond hundred hour week. Everything I knew would be bad had been\nworse and a load of things I'd never known enough to consider were\nputting the icing on the cake. I was stressed, news stories were bringing in\ncomplaints; but my team was coming together (which seemed stressful\nenough - continual meet&greets) and people were reading FELIX across\ncollege (yet you can't help thinking no readers would ' = ' an easier life...)\nIt's now late January, I'm on a sensible fifty hour week and half my\nissues are under the bridge. Things are quite relaxing: the strange thing is\nit is those mad weeks at the start that I miss most! Don't get me wrong -I'm not some masochistic stress-lover nor am I an insomniac. It's just that,\nsuddenly at the start of that October, something I was doing suddenly\nseemed important. I know FELIX isn't the last word in vital world organs\nbut try thinking that when you see it being read by 4500 people, or when\nthe Managing Director is on the phone for 'a word' or when the Union\nwho you work for is breathing down your neck.\nIt's Ying and Yang. For every petulant complaint from someone\nslighted or grief stricken hour of panicky feeling that you're not doing\nyour job properly (being vicious enough!), there's the beautiful feeling\nwhen someone comes in during the middle of their exams to take vital\nphotos, or you study a double spread and realise it's up to professional\nstandards. The moment you calculate your advertising has topped ten\nthousand pounds, the time you collate the welfare handbook (study the\n'print unit' bit in the title above!) on Sunday night for ten hours but\neveryone is smiling. The time you go out with your staff to the Mongolian\nBBQ and realise that more then a paper you are managing people.\nAs FELIX Editor and Print Unit Manager you will be responsible for\na weekly magazine and the Union's in house printing facilities. But I thought you should know the real story. Owain Bennallack\n2UM19 S FELIX MM\n\n"

    "content": "Standby\nmyo graph ferns [1923]\nman ray was one of the few\npeople to bring photography above\nthe realm of mere image and into\ntrue art. He is famed for a few\nclassic images, such as the female\nwhose back becomes transformed\ninto a violin. However, his work\nextended far beyond that, and the\nfull extent of it can be seen at the\nnearby Serpentine gallery. The work\non show presents something of the\nenigma that the artist became.\nBorn of the early Parisian\nsurrealists, Man Ray's work is\nindebted to the surreal ethos, and\nyet seems far beyond it. His\nphotographs have a pure and\ntimeless quality that gives them an\nair of being almost beyond art\u00a9.\nPerhaps something higher, or\nperhaps something more base,\nsuch as a billboard ad. The images\non show cross the whole span of\nhis work, from his metamorphosed\nfigures to portraits, paintings,\nsculptures and more. Although this\nrange is broad, all of the works are\ntied together by the strange,\nindefinable quality that character-sed Man Ray's work. Really, the\nonly true way to describe him is as\nan experimenter. Always trying out\nideas, he became the inventor of\nvarious photographic techniques.\nHis rayo graphs are shadowy\nrecreations made without a camera, and his sola rising technique lends a detached, almost\nholocaust ic air to his nudes.\nHowever I feel that the true nature\nof Man Ray's character can only be\nunderstood by looking at his\nportraits. They are the most\nstraightforward of his photographs,\nbut also the most human and\ncreative of his works. Those on\ndisplay at the Serpentine are the\nreal highlight of the show; not only\nare they superb but they represent\na veritable artistic hall of fame. All\nof the surrealists are there along\nwith other painters, poets and\nwriters. Marcel Duchamp gazes out\nalongside Picasso and Matisse,\nwhilst a stern Miro stands by a string of pearls. Marcel Proust lies\non his death bed and at the end is\nMan Ray himself, bleached by the\nsolari zing glare of his own\npenetrating lens.

    "content": "News and Editorial\nSecurity Assaulted Condoms\nBYTE DW. SHI R MAN Following an incident in the\nearly hours of Saturday morning,\nit has emerged that an Imperial\nCollege student is to appear\nbefore the College Disciplinary\nCommittee charged wit h punching a security officer. The\nalleged assault took place in the\nentrance to Beit Quad around\n12:30am, and also involved\nanother person who is not an IC\nstudent.\nObservers claim that the\naffair started when a group of\nstudents attempted to enter the\nUnion against the wishes of the\nUnion stewards. Beit Arch Lodge\nsecurity, manned 24-hours a day,\nimmediately called for assistance\non his security radio. This resulted in the arrival, moments\nlater, of additional security\nofficers who together with the\nUnion Stewards were able to\npersuade the persons in question\nto leave.\nTerry Briley, Deputy Head\nof Security commented that the\nBeit Arch Lodge security officer\nwas very fortunate in that there\nwas a mobile unit on the corner\nof Exhibition Road and Prince\nConsort Road.\nWhile reports from those\npresent have been forwarded to\nthe Union, it has not been\nestablished when exactly the\nalleged assault took place, or\nwhat punishment the accused\nstudent faces. However, Mr Briley did insist on comp-li men ting those who helped\nsaying, \" I'd like to express\nthanks to the Union stewards for\ntheir promptness and profess-ional is m.\" BY RACHEL WALTERS Safe sex in the JCR has become a real possibility with the\ninstallation of three new condom\nmachines in the Sherfield\nbuilding.\nMachines are being installed\nin the toilets by the J CR and in\nthe gents round the back of the\nsecurity office on the ground\nfloor.\nCommenting on the news,\nAnnie Mathewman, ICU Welfare\nOfficer said that she was pleased\nthat college had responded to the\nUnion request. \"There's no point\nin shouting off about safe sex if\ncollege don't do anything about\nit,\" she said.\n(RCS to vote on NUS continues from page 2)\nbudget allocations, resulting in a considerable effect on its\nrunning costs. It is also difficult\nto see what the benefits of NUS membership would be to aCC U since student bars and catering\nare managed by ICU.\nRepresentatives from the\nNUS will be at college on\nFebruary 3rd,7 th and 10th as\npart of the consultation period as\nICU reconsiders its status. The\nfinancial details are still being\nexamined by union officials,\nalthough it has been suggested\nthat if the affiliation cost can be\nnegotiated down, ICU could\nmake considerable savings on\nthe cheaper alcohol that the\nNUS, as one of the largest\nbuying groups in the country,\ncould supply.\n@<ii fe) riaL=\nShot through the foot\nWhen I planned the letters page I wanted to make more lively and\n'instant' and hoped to receive a large mail bag. As the number of\nletters has not really increased\nthis year, I can only question\nwhy. Two things seem possible.\nFirstly, to avoid a 'voice of\ngod' feel I 've had different people\nedit the letters page every week. I reasoned that the letter's editor\nwould be in almost the same\nposition as the writer. Have\npeople been put off because of\nfear of being outwitted or even\nattacked in print? Secondly, I decided to give the letter's editor\na virtually free hand in what they\nwrote. When I 've disagreed my\nonly option has been to argue\nwith the letter's editor and/or let\nit go. This week is a good\nexample. Helen and Jane's letter\nconcerning the Ents manager\nraises an issue which David has\ndismissed without considering\nwhat he's written. The loss of\nevery bit of student control is\nimportant. When there were still\nlarge numbers of the 'hacks' that\nDavid dismisses, they were the\nbutt of many jokes but nowadays\nanyone who takes an interest in\nthe Union seems more like a worthy lone crusader. There are\nprecious few left.\nAnd to the people who ask\nfor more FELICE S in Chemistry, I shall do my best and\nthank you for your interest!\nSerious Cat?\nNot only have I worried about\nthe letters page but a couple of\npeople have said that FELIX is\nbecoming a little too serious.\nWhilst I won't censor e out\narticles by people with something\nimportant to say, I am open to\nnew voices. If you have any ideas\nfor funny features or even\nPythonesque antics beyond my\nimagining than please come in. If\nyou can lend a hand in producing\nthem than that's even better.\nHowever, I offer the following joke as a temporary measure:\nA miserable man by the\nname of Paul, who had been\ndi sad van at aged since birth by his\nimperfectly proportioned head,\ninhabited a small dwelling on the\nfifth floor of a fifty floor building.\nIt was situated in an area of\nextreme hardship, having suffered many a tory rate-capping in\nthe years gone by but anyway one\nday Paul woke to a knocking.\nInstead of thinking how lucky he\nwas, as latest reports indicate that\n2.8% of human beings do not\nwake in the morning and in fact\ndie in their sleep, a tragedy we\nshould all ponder and write\narticles about, he instead rushed\nto answer the door. (This was of\ncourse foolish - most break-in\nvictims let in the assail i ants. The\nshotgun at the door lock is a myth). He arrived, as I have\nstressed and opened it, without\neven using his door chain.\n\"Hello?\" he enquired. There\nwas no reply. Paul shouldn't have\nbeen sup rise d he was displaying\ngross language-centric insensitivity in expecting the person at\nthe door to respond con veni ant ly in his own native tongue. Then\nPaul closed the door.\nHe went back to switch on\nhis television and waste several\nhours in a brain-sodden ing exercise ( Did he ever consider\nsomething else, such as learning\nthe flute or perhaps taking up a new sport? He did not).\nPaul was roused from his\nrevery by a further knocking at\nthe door. He was very angry on\nrising, which was foolish of him.\nHe should have learnt to manage\nstress at an earlier age, what with\nall the cruel insults he had to\nendure due to his head size.\nHe arrived at the door once\nmore. Foolishly he again adopted\nnone of the security measures we\nsuggested in paragraph one.\n\" Hello?\" he asked again.\nRather than arrogantly slamming\nthe door once more, he looked a little further and noticed a small\nsnail innocently perched on the\n'Welcome Home' mat.\nAngrily, and showing\nextreme phylum is m.( The belief\nthat one's own class of organism\nis inherently superior to another\nbecause of the supposed greater\nsophistication of its body plan),\nhe booted the snail at the wall\nopposite and slammed the door.\nTime went by. Paul spent his\ntime in front of mirrors and\nchanging channels, occassional y going for a( time consuming) hair\ncut. One day his aimless\nexistance was interrupted by a knocking at the door.\n\"Hello?\" Paul enquired.\n\"What did you do that for?\"\nreplied the snail at his feet.\nCredits\nEditor\nPrinter\nBusiness Manager\nAdvertising Manager\nEditorial Team\nOwain Bennallack\nAndy Thompson\nTim Bavister\nHelen Randall\nArt & Literature\nCinema\nClubs, Societies & Union\nColumns\nFeatures\nLayout and Design\nMusic\nNews Andrew\nPhotography Ivan\nS Flles\nSeven Day Guide\nSport Juliette\nStandby\nTheatre\nEditorial Assistance\nJon Jordan\nWei Lee\nPiers Daniell\nMarcus Alexander\nKate Cox\nMark Baker & Dias\nVik Bansal\nTseng & Rachel Walters\nChan & Diana Harrison\nThe Team\nJeremy Thomson\nDecock and Mark Baker\nJon Jordan\nJoseph Barr\nCollating Last Week\nHelpfulness\nJon Jordan\nSteven Newhouse\nFELIX MM\n\n"

Engineer/inventor\nBackground? Graduated from the 'garden shed'\nuniversity of life.\nWhat did he diSCO U er? The Kidd anti gravity machine.\n...Ulhich IS? A pair of gyroscopes, angular ly set and rotating centrifugal ly... whilst\nallowing upward movement.\n...pardon? You'd have to read the book.GJ\nSo what S the problem? Newton's third law of motion (every force applied must\nhave an equal and opposite reaction). His critics said that it would have to defy\nNewton's third law to work, as no opposing force is produced. But supporters\n(Prof. Laithwaite, ex-IC) reckon that it exploits a loophole in the law. Newton's law is applied to bodies either travelling in a straight line or rotating, not both.\nAfter many years trying to convince the establishment, the Australians whisked\nhim off for development. He has since provided scientifically rigorous evidence\nfor his device. The real barrier to acceptance is that no one knows how it works.\nWhatUllll happen? When there is a mechanism, the phrase 'the sky's the limit' will\nprobably have to be rewritten for Kidd. Aside from speedy space travel and\npollution free transport, the applications are mind blowing. Either way, Kidd\nwill have the last laugh. Then there will be books, films, pencil cases s...

Class Ilo tes0H James Lou e loch Who IS he? geo physiologist/ inventor\nBackground? Professor, FRS. Whilst at NASA he\nsuccessfully predicted that Mars would be lifeless because its atmosphere was at chemical\nequilibrium.\nLUhat did he discover? The GAIA hypothesis\n...UlhlchlS? The idea that Earth's biota evolves to maintain conditions for life.\n...pardon? You'd have to read the book. CO\nSo Ulhat S the problem? Darwin's theory of natural selection. Opponents to\nLovelock say that individual organisms would have to act teleological y( with\npredetermined design or purpose) and non-selfishly. Lovelock argues that\nindividuals can benefit by making local climate alterations (such as retaining\nwater or reflecting sunlight). And that something must be maintaining the\nEarth's climate, as the Sun's output has increased by 30% since the Earth's ori-gin. A computer simulation looks promising but will not yet convince the cyn-ics.\nWhatuJlll happen? When a mechanism is established parts of Lovelock's hypothesis look feasible. But ecological theory takes a lot longer to test, prove and\naccept than physics. Lovelock has a long wait.\nHnmmtyFm: {BW\n2 U U II95 FELIX MM\n\n"
