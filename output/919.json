    "content": "Feature Felix 9\n1\n9 29 November1991 New Zealand is a beautiful country\nnestling in the South Pacific. It is\nabout the same size as the UK, has\nthree million people and seventy\nmillion sheep. It consists of three\nmain islands; the North Island,\ncontaining Auckland and Wellington, the South Island with\nChristchurch and Dunedin, and\nStewart Island (population 400) at\nthe far south. The secret of the\ncountry's beauty is its geology.\nStewart Island that had a boiler on\nthe fire for hot running water!\nI spent three years (1988-91)\nstudying for a research degree at\nMassey University in Palmerston\nNorth and was lucky enough to do\nmany of New Zealand's major\ntracks. Doubtless many people will\nhave heard of Fiordlands' famous\nMilford Track, there are however\nseveral other walks that are just as\nscenic and far more challenging.\nto the mighty Wanganui River in the\ncentre of the park. Great views of\nthe river. You must arrange to be\npicked up by jet boat at the river as\nthere is no vehicle access.\nAbel Tasman National Park:\nHome of the Abel Tasman coastal\ntrack. Justifiably famous throughout\nthe hiking world for its beautiful,\nrainforest lined, deserted sandy\nbeaches with abundant sea food\n(oysters, mussels, abalone etc).\nTramping Down\nBob Sis son,\nMathematics\nPost-doc hiked\naround New\nZealand\nNew Zealand lies at the meeting of\ntwo continental plates. This has\ncreated a spine of mountains and\nvolcanoes (with the associated hot\nsprings, geysers and earthquakes)\nrunning down the centre of the\nNorth and South Islands. This\nmakes for magnificent tramping\n(hiking for pom s). New Zealand is\njustifiably proud of its parks. The tracks are seldom crowded (I saw\nno one else for five days on the\nHeaphy Track), well maintained,\nand contain a series of huts at\napproximately five hourly intervals.\nFor a minimal fee (\u00a31.50 - \u00a32.50)\nplaced in a box in the hut, you can\nuse facilities that range from a basic\nhut with bunks, fresh water tanks\nand an open fire with chopped wood\nor coal, to some with gas rings and\ngas fires. I even found one on\nTongariro National Park: A five\nday track around the triple\nvolcanoes -of Ruapehu, Ngaruhoe\nand Tongariro. Highlights include\nhot springs near one of the huts and\n'lunar-like' terrain.\nUrewera National Park: A four\nday walk around the beautiful Lake\nWaikaramoana. Highlights include\nlush rainforest and interesting\nMaori history.\nMount Egmont National Park: A five day round-the-mountain walk.\nThe perfect cone of the Egmont\nVolcano dominates the entire\nTaranaki Peninsula. Great views\nfrom the top.\nWanganui National Park: The last remaining area of true\nwilderness in the North Island. The Matemateaonga Track (four days)\nstretches from Taranaki in the West\nThis area gets some of the best\nweather in the country. A must.\nNorth West Nelson State Forest\nPark: Contains the Heaphy and\nWangapeka Tracks, both seven day\nwalks. The Heaphy travels from\nnear Nelson to the West Coast\nthrough beech forests, tussock\nuplands and palm tree fringed\nbeaches. Along with the Abel Tasman and the Milford, one of the\nmost popular walks in the country.\nThe Wangapeka lies south of the\nHeaphy and is considerably more\nchallenging, being over much\nrougher terrain and three mountain\nsaddles. Nelson Lakes National\nPark: Contains three TraversSabine Tracks linking the parks\ntwin lakes of Rotoiti and Fotoroa\nvia the spectacular Travers Saddle.\nAnother park well known for its\n\u201410\u2014\n29 November1991 Felix 9\n1\n9 Feature good weather and fine views.\nFiordland National Park is probably\nthe largest national park in the\nsouthern hemisphere and has been\ndeclared a World Heritage Area. It\nis a wilderness region of unbroken\nmountains cut by deep fiords. It has\nvery little vehicle access. It's most\nfamous track, thought by many to\nbe the the 'finest walk in the world'\nis the Milford Track, a four day\nwalk from the head of Lake Te ith\nAn au to Milford Sound via Mackinnon Pass. On a clear day the\nview from the pass is spectacular.\nUnfortunately on the day I got there\nthere was a pea-soup er! The Milford Track is extremely popular\nand you must book ahead to claim\none of the four ty places per day\nallowed on the track. However I much preferred the ten day Dusky Sound Track, an extremely isolated\njourney in the southern end of the\npark, much less well-known than\nthe Milford and far more of a challenge. Access is across a mountain lake by small fishing boat\nthat leaves once a week.\nTracks in the Mount Aspiring\nNational Park include the\nRouteburn, Greenstone/Caples and\nRees/Dart of which the Routeburn\nis by far the most popular.\nA.' Finally Stewart Island. This was\nmy favourite walk, an 11 day trip\naround the northern half of the\nisland. Stewart Island has just one\nsam ll settlement (basically a landing\npoint for the ferry), the rest of the\nisland is a road less wilderness with\nmagnificent birdlife (kiwis, parrots\netc), penguins and seals. On this\nwalk you truly feel that you are on\nthe edge of the world, the next stop\nis Antarctica.\nBOOK NOW Ski packages from \u00a399\nfor one week in Andorra\nOther destinations\navailable ~^\nCall in now\nand book for\ndepartures\nDecember '91\nImperial College\nSherfield Building\nSW7\nApril'92 lAB'T99209l/i STA TRAVEL\nContact Bob\nSisson for more\ninformation,\nalternatively\nrefer to\n'Tramping in\nNew Zealand'\nby Jim Dufresne\n\u201411\u2014\n\n"

The stories today: An outbreak of athletes' foot has been found\namongst the dorks. If you are a dork\nand do have this illness, do not be\nafraid to report it. It will not affect\nyour trend rating. Also in the news,\nthe new skateboards are ready, so\nwill geeks please report to supplies\nfor the new boards. Finally, our\nmain story! A victory has been won\nin the perimeter war. To bring you news of this we go over to our\nreporter at the scene.'\nShe turned to her left and became\nmotionless. The camera's light went\nout and an assistant darted forward.\nHe unbuttoned the back of the\nnewscaster's blouse and removed a cassette from a slot in her back,\nreplacing it with another one. Stress\nlooked up at one of the large screens\non the front wall as a tanned\nreporter appeared, gunfire and\nexplosions behind him.\n'I'm reporting from the war zone.\nWith me is the inner system army\nleader.'\nThe goat looked up from its prone\nposition in the straw, gave me an\nexpression of utter weariness and\nvague surprise, then promptly\nexpired. The two tiny corpses\ndeposited behind it in a slime of afterbirth had been too much for its\nold and knacker ed system, so\ninstead of two new lives that\nafternoon three deaths were added\nto the roster.\nMy father came out of the house\nand stomped up the steps from what\nused to be the patio before the rot\nof negligence set in and lean t against the door of the shed.\n'Bugger, it died did it?'\nI should point out at this juncture\nthat he hated goats almost as much\nas I do, but I suspect that had the\ndaily chores of milking and feeding\nbeen his, all vestiges of tolerance\nwould have vanished.\nSince the bodies were unfit for\nthe pot, methods of disposal were\nthen discussed; the knacker s yard\nwas ruled out (they would actually\nwant money to take them away by\nGod!) and Mug gins was\nvolunteered for the dirty work.\nThe camera shifted left to gaze at\na deeply tanned, very well built rn an wearing shorts and every major\nweapon imaginable.\n'General, is the fighting still as\nfierce as when you took this sector\nof the outer areas from them?'\nThe camera zoomed in on the\ngeneral's grand canyon of a face.\nMuscles twitched and eyes darted\nas the general thought.\n' Yeh.'' They are trying to retake the\nzone then?'\n' Yeh.'' Have you suffered heavy casualties?'\n' Yeh.'' And have you...' At that point the general reached\ninto his arsenal, brought forth a pistol the size of a small tank and\nfired it down the corridor. The camera swivelled as the target\ntoppled backwards, dropping the\nbomb it had been carrying and fell\nto the floor. The general and the\nreporter ran over to the prone form.\n' Ye uck! It's horrible!!'\nThe camera passed over the\ngaping bloody hole in the dead\nman's chest and zoomed in on his\n' We' ve got a big garden and\nthere's a spade and wheelbarrow\nover there' was the verdict 'at least\nfour feet deep for the goat, the kids\ncan go out in the rubbish'.\nI think it was November, but it\nwas certainly cold and damp at the\nend of the garden as I dug that\ngrave. Four feet deep by the area\nof a goat is a hell of a lot of hard\nearth to dig. I had plenty of time to\ncontemplate as the drizzle fell and\nthe light dwindled, and by the time\nit was dug I fully understood why\ngrave diggers are supposed to be a pathologically morose lot.\nWhen at last I had a hole that\nseemed to be large enough, I was\nthoroughly anxious to get the whole\nbusiness over with. So I trudged\nback down the garden to collect the\ncadaver. I'm afraid that I was rather\nunceremonious as I dumped the\nbody in the wheelbarrow, took it to\nthe graveside and tipped it into the\nhole.\nIt was then that tragedy struck, or\nshould I say stuck. The goat had its\nlegs sticking rigidly out from its\nbody in rigor mortis and was firmly\nhead.\n' Pale skin, yellow teeth,\ndandruff, greasy hair and spots!'\nThe camera closed in on the face,\nbringing the red and yellow lumps\ninto view, it panned across the\nvolcanic region into the snowy\nheights above. In the newsroom\nStress watched as the tanned,\nblemish free personnel screwed up\ntheir faces in disgust, some turning\ntheir eyes away. One of the\noperators clutched his mouth and\nran from the room.\nOn the screen the reporter stood\nup, visibly shaken.\n' Here we see one of the\ndisgusting creatures that surround\nour system, constantly trying to\nbreak through and overwhelm us.\nIf it was not for the endless work\nof the army and government we\nwould be destroyed in hours.'\nThe large screen went dark, the\ncamera light went on and the\nnewscaster started moving again.\n' A harrowing story there from\nour reporter in the war zone. That's all from the newsroom for now,\nstay tuned.'\nThe lights around her went dark\nand the camera light turned off. The\nwoman next to Stress started\ncrawling back down the tunnel.\n' Follow me and I 'll tell you everything.'\nwedged in the top of its grave with\nits head staring up at me in an\nexpression of yellow toothed\nmalice.\nThe drizzle by this time had\nstarted to bear more than a passing\nresemblance to full blown rain, the\nwind had picked up and the light\nwas fading fast. All that was\nrequired was a couple of lightning\nflashes and Vlad Dracul would have\nfelt quite at home in that\nHertfordshire garden.\nIn short I wanted that corpse\nburied and buried fast, so I jumped\non it.\nIn life that goat had been known,\nun originally perhaps, as Snowy to\nmy younger brothers due to its dirty\nwhite fur. To me it had usually\nanswered to Youferkinbastard. It\ngot its revenge. On the point of\nbreathing its last it had inhaled its\nterminal breath rather than the\ntraditional exhaling its last.\nMy boots connected with its\nribcage.\nBaaaaaaaa!\nI solemnly swear that Ben Johnson on a six pack of steroids\nwould have been eating my dust on\nthe way back down that garden.\nYouferkinbastard's Revenge\n\u201412\u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews Felix 919 29 November1991 Point Break Hot Shots!\nKeanu Reeves is fast becoming hot\nproperty in Hollywood. The role he\nplays in Point Break is quite a quantum leap for him, being\nrenowned for taking roles where\nbeing stupid was factor number one\n(i.e. Bill & Ted's Excellent\nAdventure, Parenthood); he plays,\nwith a great deal of authenticity I might add, an FBI agent on the trail\nof the 'Ex-Presidents'\u2014a bunch of masked bank robbers, who remain\nperfectly un caught after two years\n(and about seventy banks). It was\ndeduced that these guys (sorry\n'dudes') were surfers. This is where\nPatrick Swayze comes in; a surfer\nby profession and complete n utter the rest of the time, constantly in\nsearch of the ultimate ride, risking\nall for the biggest high! In fact, as\nthe film progresses it becomes\nevident that Keanu Reeves also is\nlosing his marbles. The two\ncompete for the most daring (or\nshould that be stupid\u2014o.k. let's see\nwho pulls their parachute rip cord closest to the ground then!!).\nPatrick Swayze plays a more\nminor role than the trailers and hype\nwould have you believe; it's Keanu\nthat really steals the show, and it's his character you see developing, so\nby the end you can't help but feel\nrather empty about Patrick's role\n(unlike his role in blockbusters such\nas Ghost or Dirty Dancing). One just doesn't get the chance to trust\nhim, which is just as well because...(now you must prepare\nyourself for this, take a seat, stick\na hanky in your gob) Patrick\nSwayze is a bad guy!!! Noooooo!\nI hear you cry, I'm sorry, but it's true.\nI personally think the film is\ngreat; it does have some curious\nwriggles but then nothing's perfect\nis it? Included is some absolutely\nbreathtaking photography,( honestly, it really is something\nquite special), some hot and steamy\nromance, plenty of action; car\nchases, running down the high\nstreet with your piece out (that's a gun) Mel Gibson style, morals,\nfriendship, a meandering plot, the\nlist goes on. It will doubtlessly be\ncompared to films like Lethal\nWeapon and Beverly Hill Cop, but\nit really is a much fresher approach\nto the genre, and a credit to both\nactors.\nPoo.\nHot Shots! (I hate films with\nexclamation marks in their name)\nis the latest produce from the Police\nSquad and The Naked Gun stables.\nLike most things out of stables, it\nalso generates a lot of shit and has\na glossy chestnut coat.\nAs usual, this one is a spoof\n(that's a crap word, isn't it?) of famous flicks from years past; this\ntime the target is Top Gun and its\nilk of dinosaur macho bollocks\nmovies. And a worthy target it is\ntoo, as Barry Norman would say.\nCharlie Sheen plays a fly boy, Topper Harley, with a dark secret;\nthrown out of his squadron once,\nhe's re-recruited for a deadly\nmission, coded 'Sleepy Weasel'.\nOnce back, he has to contend with\njealous rivals, a leggy psychiatrist\nand a brace of chihuahua, as well\nas circumventing the visual gags\nthat pop out of every crevice. Said\ngags are pretty good, but unfortunately they' re so\neffervescent I don't remember any\nof them. I guess that says something\nabout the film. Oh yeah., the guy\nwith the fish in his glasses, the\nmilitary arm patch that say 'Perrier'\nand hundreds of others. No, really,\nthere are. Just because I can't recall\nthem doesn't mean you won't enjoy\nthem. Honest. Thankfully the\nwriters appear to have left\nadolescence now and there isn't the\ntraditional strip joint sequence,\nalthough there are more pratfalls\nthan anyone could really want. In\nfact, the main weak point of this\nfilm is that while the background\njokes are still fresh, the humour of the script itself is growing more\ntired with every release this team\ndo.\nGo see this film for mindless\nenjoyment; it'll do you good. The Token American doesn't get the\npoint of this film. But that's why\nshe's American. The Flying Gerbil Valmont\nValmont is Milos Forman's first\nfilm since Amadeus in 1984. It is\nan adaption of the book Les\nLiaisons Dangereuses and is the\nsecond film to be based on this\nnovel by Choderlos de Laclos. The previous production, Dangerous\nLiaisons, directed by Stephen\nFrears was adapted from the play\nby Chris Hampton rather than the\nnovel itself, which accounts for the\ndifferences in the story. Frears' film\nstarred Glenn Close as the scheming\nMarquise de Merteuil and John\nMalkovich as Valmont.\nMiles Forman began the shooting\nof his film before Frears but was\nunable to compete with the larger\nproduction which was completed\nearlier. In order to avoid a clash\nbetween the two, it was decided to\ndelay the release of this film until\nnow.\nThe story revolves around two\n18th Century aristocrats Merteuil\nand Valmont (played by Annette\nBening and Colin Frith). They are\nboth accomplished in the art of seduction and will stop at nothing\nto achieve what they desire.\nMerteuil wishes Valmont to aid her\nin revenge by seducing the 15-year-old virgin Cecile who is betrothed\nto her ex-lover. Valmont however\nis intent on a conquest of his own, over the virtuous and beautiful\nMade de Tourvel (played by Meg Tilly).\nWith names such as Glenn Close\nand John MaLkovich as\npredecessors, Annette Bening and\nColin Firth have a lot to compete\nwith in the inevitable comparisons\nbetween the two films.\nBening is fortunate in that the\ncharacter of Merteuil in this film is\ndeeper. She is more involved with\nCecile as a seemingly caring\ncompanion whilst at the same time\nis plotting to ruin her.\nCecile also has a larger and more\nlikeable role in this film. She\nappears as a younger and more\ninnocent victim.\nThe character of Valmont is the\nbiggest difference between the two\nproduction s.He is a more sympathetic figure here with some\nromantic qualities as opposed to the\ncold calculating methods used by\nMalkovitch's Valmont.\nOverall, this production is a more\ncompelling version than Dangerous\nLiaisons as the relationship between\nMerteuil and Valmont is more\ntangible. Bening in particular\nperforms exceptionally well.\n\u201416\u2014\n\n"

Obviously\nno one could attend to a mascot 24\nhours a day, so back to the detective\nwork to find the hiding place. Also,\nfunctions could not be disrupted if the bearer was anywhere in the\nfunction, and the mascots, safe with\ntheir bearers, would be seen around\ncollege a lot more.\nThese rules may not cover everything, but with luck, wisdom\nwill prevail.\nIn summary, I believe that\nmascot ry in its present form at IC is an abomination, but Mascotry in\nits pure and intended form has many\npositive aspects. It is only a personal view, but I think it is\npossible to revive the original\nconcept.\nYours,\nP.A. Kendall, Physics '86-'89\nPalestine Speaker\nDear Adam,\nIn response to the replies to my\nletter concerning the invitation of a PLO representative to speak in this\ncollege, I would just like to make\na few comments.\nFirst of all, both' of the letters\nimplied that the PLO is the only\nlegitimate voice piece of the\nPalestinian people. The PLO have\nnever been elected as their official\npolitical body and in fact, any\nPalestinian would. be terrified of standing in opposition to them for\nfear of being murdered.\nSecondly, according to one of the\nletters 'There have been more\nPalestinians killed over the past\nthree years than Israelis'. This may\nvery well be so, but what is not\nmentioned is the fact that in the\nlarge majority of cases, the killing\nof Palestinians has been carried out\nby their own kind, for collaboration, rather than by\nIsraelis. I would also question the\nterminology used by HoY in Wong and Tobias Schrag who write\nconcerning the justified 'restoration\nof the Palestinian State'. For the\nneeds of peace and security, I would\nfully support the creation of a Palestinian State but I can in no way\nagree with their claim that one has\nexisted in the past.\nLee Matthews, the treasurer of the Anti War in the Gulf Society\n(now the Just Peace in the Middle\nEast Society) who put on the\nmeeting, claims in the other letter\nthat it was wrong of me to speculate\non the reasons for the imprisonment\nof the PLO representative. Nevertheless, I don't understand\nwhy he can't put an end to my speculation, however misguided it\nis, by stating for what reason this\nperson was placed in an Israeli\nprison for ten years as a member of\nthe PLO. Political aspects aside,\nI'm sure that he can appreciate how\nit is possible for someone to feel\nthreatened by having a possible\nmurderer of innocent people\nspeaking freely in their college.\nI agree completely that it is only\nwith the exchange of views from\nboth sides that eventual peace will\nbe reached. I would suggest,\nhowever, that the next time a debate\non this issue is held by the society,\na spokesman from the Israeli side\nis invited and I hope that they think\nmore carefully about the choice for\nthe opposing speaker.\nYours sincerely,\nGaby Pell, Physics 2.\nDisgraceful Dutch Guilds Security\nDear Editor,\nIn response to a letter by a fellow\ncountryman in last week's Felix, I would like to state the following:\nDutch law isn't brilliant, it is\ndisgraceful. Sex at 12, who wants\nto have sex with a girl with no hair\n(sorry Sinead O' Connor). I mean\nwhere do you rest the egg whisk? James Brown was mistaken when\nhe said money was the root of all\nevil. He omitted alcohol, alongside\ncash. I never drink it or talk to\npeople who do. It is a sad substance\nfor sad persons with no brain\npower. As for drugs...don't ask.\nIam therefore arranging a weekend at my house in Holland,\nwhere we will walk the streets of Amsterdam as a protest against the\ngovernment. Have no fear I will\nprotect you all from the vices.\nUalpy Fitzgerald.\nBernard Sunley.\nRamming Evolution\nDear Adam,\nRe. Ramming Isn't it amazing how narrow-minded some people are? If a Christian were to write in an article\nas narrow-minded and ill-reasoned\nas Professor Scorer's Legacy of\nEvolution, they would be accused\nof blatantly ramming their beliefs\ndown other people's throats, and\nprobably forbidden from writing\nanything of the sort again. So why\ndoes Prof Scorer get away with it?\nMost people reading Prof Scorer's article would believe that\nevolution is a true fact, whereas\nChristianity is just belief. The fact\nis that neither one can be proved or\ndisproved. Throughout our education we are taught that the\nwhole world operates according to\nsimple mathematical rules, without\nthe interaction of a God. This\nassumption is the foundation of modern science. We are all brainwashed from a very early age\ninto thinking that the world has no\nneed for God, and few of us have\nthe guts to rebel against this.\nIt's funny: people complain about\nChristians ramming their beliefs\ndown other people's throats, but\natheists are much worse. I probably\nknew about evolution from primary\nschool, yet I never knew what\nChristianity was really about until\nI was sixteen. It's amazing how few\npeople actually know what\nChristianity is about\u2014it's not a question of' if you're good, you go\nto heaven'. Why not broaden your\nhorizons, and find out?\nTom di Giovanni,\nMaths 3.\nDear Editor,\nI feel it necessary to write to you\nin response to your editorial in issue\n918 and in particular your comments on the drunken ess of the\nsecurity at Guilds Carnival. To quote 'most of these additional and\nvery necessary helpers were totally\ndrunk early in the evening'. I admit\nthat there was one particular case\nof excessive drinking brought to my\nattention and this person was dealt\nwith and other people brought in to\ncover.\nHowever, on the whole security\nwas excellent and this is, in the\nmain, due to the hard work on the\nnight of the Guilds Security\ncoordinator, Mark Jackson. He reported no problems, other than\nthe aforementioned, to me throughout the night.\nWhen there was the possibility of\nsome trouble, this was dealt with\nefficiently by our own people and\nMandy Hur ford, the Union Manager.\nSo, I would like to thank\neveryone who helped with security\nat the Guilds Carnival and everyone\nwho helped in any other way. In\nparticular I would like to thank\nMark Jackson and Mandy Hurford\nfor their respective help and advice,\nduring and before the event.\nFinally, a couple of further points.\nFirstly, it would be nice if you could\nstop treating Felix as your personal\nsoap box. And, secondly, you are\nconstantly complaining about the\napathy at IC and I agree with you.\nHowever, Felix, in its current\nformat, does little to inspire\nanything except apathy.\nYours non-apathetically,\nSteve Hoborough,\nC&G College Union Ents Chair.\nPlease print in full.\nMy complaints as to the efficacy\nof Guilds Security on the night in\nquestion was directed at some of\nthe stewards rather than the\n.Security Co-or dina tors.I apologise for any confusion in this\nmatter.\nAs to my using Felix as a 'personal soap box'; what do you\nsuppose editorials are for? Do you\nexpect my to say that everything\nis just ticket y boo every week? It\nisn't, and you would have more\ncause for complaint if I was that\ncomplacent.\nAny suggestions as to how to\nimprove Felix will be gratefully\nreceived, provided that they are\nrealistic. I fail to see how\nchanging the 'format' of Felix\nwould inspire the student body to\nanything better. I can't really see\nthat changing from Times Roman\nto Univers body text and increasing the size to a tabloid, or\neven rearranging the page layout\nwould do anything save cause\nconfusion. It takes issues to\nmobil is e public opinion, not\nnewspaper aesthetics.\n-Adam.\n\u2014 5 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nOne million children die each\nyear as a consequence of being\nbottle fed rather than breast fed.\nThe United Nation's World Health\nOrganisation ( WHO) notes three\nmain reasons for these deaths\u2022 Medically speaking breast\nfeeding is superior to bottle feeding\nbecause although the protein content\nis similar, mothers' milk has the\nadded advantage of being specially\ntailored for the child and providing\nimmunity to various diseases.\n\u2022 The water used to mix with the\npowdered milk is often dirty. In a community without clean drinking\nwater a bottle fed baby is 25 times\nmore likely to die of diarrhoea.\n\u2022 The high cost of powdered milk\nmeans that children are not fed\nenough and this leads to\nmalnutrition.\nSo why do mothers bottle feed if\nbreast milk is free, safe and protects\nagainst infection, and bottle feeding\nis known to be dangerous, unsuitable and expensive? The answer is simple - it is in the\ninterests of the baby milk manufacturers. The world baby\nmilk market is worth around \u00a36\nbillion and half of this comes from\nthe Third World. As a consequence the large milk\nmanufacturers aggressively market\nin the Third World. Obviously there\nis nothing wrong with a company\ntrying to sell its product, but their\nmarketing techniques are highly\nunethical. The companies provide\nfree milk to maternity hospitals and\nclinics and employ staff to educate\nmothers in how to bottle feed.\nNormally each mother is given a free sample of the milk when she\nleaves the hospital. Thus mothers\nare given the impression that the\nhealth service is recommending\nbottle feeding rather than breast\nfeeding. This technique is so\neffective that one industry manual\nstates, 'when considering that for\nevery 100 infants discharged on a particular formula brand, 93 infants\nremain on that brand, the\nimportance of hospital selling\nbecomes obvious.'\nHealth workers often feel\nindebted to the milk companies who\nprovide them with other perks, and\nsince most of them lack any formal\nmedical education. They believe the\nglossy health brochures extolling\nthe virtues of bottle feeding that the\ncompanies produce.\nVery few countries are powerful\nenough to stop the activities of the\nmulti-national milk companies,\nespecially since many of these\ncountries rely upon the companies\nfor their foreign exports. Costa Rica\nis one of the few countries who\nenforce a strong anti-milk company\ncode, here all babies are breast fed\n(or given locally produced substitutes), and they now have the\nlowest infant death rate in Latin\nAmerica. The WHO and the United Nations Childrens Fund ( UNICEF) have produced a code of ethics for\nthe marketing of baby milk in the\nThird World which all the\ncompanies have signed and agreed\nto follow. This code bans the direct\nadvertising of baby milk, and bans\nthe supply of free milk to hospitals.\nHowever, these rules are constantly\ncontravened either directly or\nmanufacturer, it is the largest with\n5 0 % of the market. The only way\nto affect a large corporation is to\ndamage its public image or its\nprofits. B MAC has persuaded a large number of people and\norganisations to boycott Nestle\nproducts or to protest to Nestle. IC\nThird World First is aiming to make\npeople aware of the situation and to\nencourage staff, students and the\ncollege as a whole to abandon\nNestle products, the Union has\nalready passed a motion nd Honey\nindirectly. To side-step the rules on\nhospital supplies the companies now\ncharge a nominal amount and often\nnever enforce payment.\nProbably one of the most\ndisgusting aspects of the milk\ncompany marketing is the\nproduction of free literature for the\nhealth service which give information on breast feeding. The information in these leaflets is often\nmisleading so that breast feeding\nwill be uncomfortable for the\nmothers thus causing them to swap\nto bottle feeding.\nIn an attempt to combat the\nactions of the milk companies a group called Baby Milk Action\nCoalition ( B MAC) is conducting a boycott of Nestle products. IC Third World First have adopted this\nboycott as one of its campaigns for\nthis year. The aim of the boycott is\nnot to prevent the use of powdered\nmilk, in some cases it may be\nnecessary, or mothers may not wish\nto breast feed and they should be\ngiven the right to feed their babies\nhow they wish. However what we\nare concerned about is the unethical\nmarketing of baby milk in countries\nwhere it is not appropriate. The aim\nof B MAC is to put pressure on\nNestle to conform to the WHO rules. Nestle has been target ted because, although it is not the only\ncondemning Nestle's actions and\nstock very few of their products.\nWe are aiming to involve the other\n' London colleges in this campaign,\nand shall be presenting the same\nmotion at UL U( University of\nLondon) in December.\nAs individuals you can stop\ndrinking Nescafe, there are lots of\nalternatives (supermarkets' own\nbrands tend to be just as good and\nmuch cheaper). If you wish to write\nto Nestle we will be able to give you\ninformation and ideas for a letter.\nSceptics may argue that such\ncampaigns are ineffective, and it is\ntrue that there has been action\nagainst Nestle for over ten years,\nhowever the action is now quite\nwidespread and it must be starting\nto hurt since Nestle produce counter\npublicity to defend their case.\nIC Third World First aim to\nhighlight Third World issues, and\nour other campaign this year is on\nthe debt crisis. We have speaker\nmeetings each Thursday( see\nposters) and general meetings each\nFriday lunchtime in Southside\nUpper Lounge. If you have any\nquestions or comments on what we\ndo, then either come along to a meeting, write to us via the Union pigeonholes or write a letter to\nFelix.\nJacob Tompkins\non the indirect\ngenocide of milk\nmanufacturers\n-13-\n"

Zodiac\nMindwarp and the Love Reaction?\nWell, I could talk about the\ndifficulties of getting down to the\nAcademy and sticking out from the\nrest of the audience when you're\ndrunken and black-clad, but I Music Editorial\nI'm going to do something unprecedented for a Felix Music Editor; I'm going to yield to my\naudience. The reason for this is,\nthough you may not all be fans of\nQueen, I believe their music has, at\nsome time or another, played a part\nin all of your lives. Some of my\nearliest memories of pop music\ninclude songs like 'Seven Seas of\nRh ye',' Killer Queen' and\n'Bohemian Rhapsody', and for that\nreason, I mourn the sad death of\nFreddie Mercury. I also believe his\nfans at IC would like to see\nsomething written about him in their\nnewspaper.\nIt would be insincere of me to\nclaim to be a fan of Queen; at times\nI found them pompous, bloated and\npuerile. But I think they made some\ngenuinely great records all the\nwon't. The audience think you\nbelong to the public, the public\nthink you belong to the audience,\nand I think I need a new mascara.\nThe sight of so many Hippygoths\n(as opposed to Visigoths, or\nOstrogoths) occasions me to\nwonder who they've come to see;\nwhatever, I'm in a cultural no-man's land. Dr. Phibes were quite\ngood, but not as good as the film,\nand not good enough to have their\nfull name written out - I'm an\nArtist! I need Space! I also need to\nsearch frantically through the\ndictionary to find new adjectives for\nCranes. It's not enough to keep\nsaying 'somnolent' and 'beauteous',\neven' primal' is becoming synonymous with staleness. So, do\nCranes ride the storm clouds over\nthe Elysian fields, abject and\nsame. 'Seven Seas of Rh ye','T ie your mother down', 'Somebody to\nLove', songs that were really quite\nmarvellous, songs that were loved\nby a whole generation and were yet\ntimeless. Anyway, whatever excesses Queen were guilty of, they\nwere arguably the most popular\nband in the world. What is more,\nthey were nothing without Freddie\nMercury. I was shocked to hear of\nhis death. The man was so alive.\nThe televised tribute on monday\nnight really hit me with that fact; his\nenthusiasm, his talent, his greatest\nmoments. Freddie Mercury was a star, more than anyone else in my\ntime, and I'm going to dig out my\ncopy of 'Night at the Opera' and\ncrank up the volume to ' The Prophet Song'. People, can you\nhear me?.\nDavid Spooner\nabandoned? Of course they do, and\nmore besides. You know that. If\nthere's any criticism, it's that you\nlose something of the atmosphere in\na large venue, not that it's terribly\nbig; no, more than that is the fact\nthat it's not supposed to be Cranes\ngig and therefore not tailored to\nthem. No matter. It's still a brilliant\nperformance.\nAnd onto All About Eve. I first\nheard 'In the clouds' on it's release\nfour years ago, and I must confess\nI was rather swayed by Julianne\nRegan prancing around the fluffy,\nwomb-like set with the band\ndiscreetly in the background.\nWhere they should be. I even\nbought their first album, in spite of\nWayne Hussey's involvement, and\nI did quite like some of the songs\nthere in. Translated to this\nShit. I Just stood on the record and\nit didn't break. I hate it when that\nhappens. 'Indie'. There is good\nindie and there is bad indie.\nUnfortunately for me, 'Manchester'\nis a four-letter word, and 'pop' is\none I find so repulsive, I wouldn't Sandira\nHaving foregone the fame and\ncredibility of being the Shamen's percussionist, Sandira has chosen to\ncut her own way in this world of\nshort lives and artistic amputation,\nthe wisdom of which entirely\nescapes me; for female soloists to\nsurvive in this business, and remain\nunscathed, requires a stubborn,\nresolute, uncompromising determination, and few seem to\nmake it.!Kate Bush, Madonna, at a push, Belinda Carlisle. The rest,\nfrom Joni Mitchell to Diamanda\nGalas, become ' Cult'. I'd better leave the issue of\ninherent sexism in the pop audience,' cos it feels like dangerous territory, and I am\nsupposed to be reviewing this; so,\nperformance, 'Every Angel', 'What\nkind of fool', 'In the clouds' et\ncetera, are sounding pretty tired\nnow. I'm sorry, but they really need\nkicking for peddling the same old\nshit in such an unimaginative,\nnotes- by-numbers routine. The fiddly guitar parts and the vocal\ninflections are so startlingly dull, so\nmeticulously rehearsed from the\noriginals, one wonders why they\ndidn't just set the tape running.\nJesus Christ, in ' Martha' s Harbour', the whole audience\nrepeats word for word, sigh for\nsigh, stress for stress. It's appropriate, and sadly ironic, at the\nmoment to say something like 'the\nQueen is dead: Long live the\nQueen', but a dead Freddie Mercury has so much more life than\na live All About Eve.\nDavid\ninflict it on my mother.\n'This is Manchester indie pop'.\nAll the devilish imps numbered in\nSatan's minions would surely find\nthemselves on the ends of their own\ntoasting forks were they to utter\nthese words, and lest ye lose your\nstreet c red for all eternity, I guard\nyou, never speak in such terms.\nAnd as for the halfway dance able' B' side, well, you wouldn't want\nto listen to it anyway.\nSeb and his bastard s quit ty half-brother.\nthere are three songs on this, her\nfirst solo effort, and they're really\nquite splendid. The richly percussive opening gives way to\nsome crisp guitar work not unlike\nMc Geo chera Banshees and a shivery vocal ranging from a flat\nhaughtiness to an edgy falsetto. This\nis followed by a delightful mediaeval piece straight out of the\nDead Can Dance catalogue, but\nwith a slightly more tangible grip\non the twentieth century, which is\nmore than can be said for it's grip\non reality as we are again treated\nto a jarring vocal delivery. Our final\npleasure is another bizarre wander\nthrough banshee territory, but this\nis genuine banshee wailing, not Mrs Budgie's affected coldness; it's more oddly detached. A: once iv able criticism of female\nvocalists in pop is that they are not\nas adaptable as their male counterparts, but such as Sandira\nshould redress the balance.

    "content": "Letters Felix 919 29 November1991 Personal View Only a Sir,\nI read last week's Felix with great\ninterest, particularly the news and\ncomment pertaining to the subject\nof mascot ry. I fully respect your\nviews, and those of Ms Creissen,\nand for the record, I should like to\nstate that I agree strongly with the\nconcept that Union policy should be\nmade by present and not past,\nstudents. However, the subject is\nraising such emotive debate; I am\noffering here my own views on the\nsubject in the hope that they will be\nof some assistance to those who\nknow little about it.\nFor many at IC the mention of\nmascot ry conjures up an image of\ncar chases through London, drilling\nthrough locks, overpowering the\nprotectors of mascots and generally\nbehaving like one of the cast of The\nItalian Job. In my opinion, this\npoint of view is held by small-minded individuals who have no\nbusiness calling themselves Mascoteers. Mascotry is not about\nany of these things, nor has it ever\nbeen.\nMascotry is, above all else, a gentlemen's game. (I am not being\nsexist; Women have as much right\nto participate as men. It is just that\nI am unable to find an egalitarian\nexpression for ' gentlemanly conduct', please bear with me.) It\nis an intellectual game, requiring\nthorough recon na is ance, meticulous\nplanning and skilled execution. To my certain knowledge, all\nsuccessful mascot ry attempts at IC\nover the last five years have\ninvolved finding the 'safe house' or\nhiding place by low profile intelligence gathering, taking\nadvantage of a lapse on the part of\nthe defenders, and two or three\npeople removing the mascot while\nit was unattended. None have been\ntaken as the result of a car chase,\nor the abuse of the so-called\n'overwhelming numbers' rule.\nThe origin of the frankly irresponsible use of vehicles is a result of people losing sight of\nexactly what they were trying to\nachieve. Originally the idea was to\nlocate the other side's safe house or\nhiding place, and this was achieved\nin many ways. Inconspicuous\nobservers on street corners would\nfollow at a discreet distance using\nan unknown car or motorcycle, or\neven a black cab. The defenders\nwould in turn attempt to spot their\nerstwhile followers and lose them,\nsometimes using a 'chase car' of\ntheir own to assist in this process,\nand so the car wars began. In actual\nfact, the view of most true\nmascot e ers is that the battle is over\nas soon as the defending crew spots\nthe follower because, like the\nhunted mother fox which runs the\nopposite direction to her burrow to\nprotect her young, even a simpleton\nwould not return to a safe house\nwith a tail.\nThe true mascot e er views the 'car\nchaser' the same way as a skilled\nangler views those who fish by\ndynamiting lakes. The only difference is that dynamite gets\nresults. It does not take an\nintellectual col loss us to realise that\nfollowing inches behind the\ndefending vehicle in a well known\ncar, wearing C CU regalia and\nwaving a large illegal radio will\nachieve very little. The accident that\noccured during the first month of'\nterm had been waiting to happen\nsince the very first time a driver was\ntoo stupid or proud to give up when\nhe had been spotted.\nHow can we play this game in a gentlemanly fashion? Consider the\nexample of the two RCS men who\nlocated the cupboard inside Mines\nwhere Davy was kept. They did this\nby hiding in broom cupboards after\neach U GM, comparing notes on\nwhich corridors the procession\npassed and how long it was before\nthe bearers reappeared, slowly\nbuilding up a picture over a year\nuntil the cupboard was located. This\nis real mascot ry, of a sort practised\nas recently as last academic year\nagainst other London colleges,\nstrangely enough by the same\npeople who organise the inter C CU car chases. So what makes in-house\nmascot ry such a dirty business?\nBasically the stakes are too high.\nTheta, the RCS mascot, is maybe\nthe biggest problem. Having remained inviolate for over fifteen\nyears (i.e. not having been stolen),\nthose protecting her will do almost\nanything to keep her. However, for\nthe same reason, those with an eye\nto her capture will go to equal\nlengths. I do not intend to debate the\nquestion of who got dirty first, or\nwho plays dirtiest; that sort of\nsquabble is meaningless and will not\nhelp solve the problem. We have to\nadmit that we have been playing the\ngame the wrong way and decide\nwhat to do about it.\nI opened by talking about\ngentlemanly conduct, and perhaps\nit is now appropriate to explain what\nI mean. Even as a loyal supporter\nof the RCS, and an ex-mascot eer,I would like to see Theta stolen.\nHowever, I would like it to be the\nresult of a monumentally clever\nscheme, involving only a handful of\npeople using guile, deception and\ngood humour, the kind of thing that\nmakes you say ' You' ve got to hand\nit to them...', and not as a result of\nan angry mob breaking up aUG M demanding that they had\n' overwhelming numbers', and\nwould we kindly hand the mascot\nover or they would beat us to a pulp. Don't laugh; it happened\nwhen I was at college.\nAs an aside, during the incident\nin question, the attacking side\nprobably did have the required three\nto one ratio which constituted\noverwhelming numbers in the\nmascot ry rules of the day, but were\ndefeated by guile. Unfair? According to the letter of the law,\nmaybe; but what about the spirit of\nthe law? In fact, the rules weren't written to encourage a 'mob rule'\napproach to mascot ry, but to\nprevent it. The rule was written\nafter the capture of a mascot some\nyears previously. The captors had\nfound the safe house and had been\nobserving it, but as it never\nappeared to be empty, their attempt\nseemed doomed. They therefore\nwaited until only two people were\nhome, concealed around twenty of\ntheir supporters in and around the\nfront garden and then two people\nknocked on the front door. When it was answered, the twenty\nrevealed themselves and the caller\nannounced that they knew the\nmascot was in the house. They did\nnot storm the front door (these were\nthe days of gentlemanly conduct,\nremember), but pointed out that\nthey could do so. The occupants,\nalso being gentlemen, did not\nattempt to slam the door, but gave\nthe attackers credit for locating the\nhouse and handed over the mascot.\nThe rule was subsequently written\nto point out that you only needed\nthree to one in that situation. I hope\nthe difference between the situations\nis clear.\nEnough of yesterday. What about\ntoday? We have established that the\nstakes are too high, and I believe\nthat we have shown that we are no\nlonger capable of conducting ourselves in a fair and and proper\nmanner. The new rules go some\nway to opposing this. They have the\nworthy objectives of making the\nmascots come out more, and\nremoving the stigma of having a mascot stolen by making the\nmascots easier to steal, but I am\nunconvinced that they will remove\nall the undesirable elements of\nmascot ry in its present state. As for\nthe ex-students that stole Theta, I have not spoken to them, but they\nare known to me personally. It is\nmy belief that they did not take her\nbecause of a small-minded attitude\nthat she should not leave the RCS, but to prevent further problems\noccur ing during Rag Week. That\nmay sound pompous, but my reasons are this; firstly, as they are\nquoted in your report, Theta is in\nfact extremely delicate and complex\nand has in the past been damaged\nby rough handling. Secondly, the\npeople who took the mascot and the\nstudents it was taken from know and\nrespect each other. If, as your\nreport implies, they almost came to\nblows, what would have been the\neffect of bringing Theta to an event\nlike the beer festival, in front of\nseveral hundred drunken students of\ndifferent CC Us, where there would\nbe no love lost?\nI have criticised the new rules, so\nnow let me be constructive. There\nare positive aspects to mascot ry, not\nleast of which is that it can raise a lot of money for Rag. It also\nprovides a sense of identity for the\nCC Us, when applied correctly.\nEven so, we have shown that we are\nnot able to play within IC, so\nperhaps a ban on inter C CU mascot ry would make those\ninvolved cast their nets further, to\nother colleges where they seem to\nbe able to behave honour ably. Personally, I would like to see\nmascot ry return to being an\nintellectual contest between the\nCC Us( after all, IC is supposed to\nbe a centre of academic excellence).\nThe rules I would propose are the\nfollowing:\n1. Motor Vehicles may only be used\nto transport mascots. Obviously\nunenforceable for the unseen\nfollower, but heavy penalties for\nCC Us and individual students\nwould stop the 'car wars' cold.\n2. A mascot may only be stolen if\nit does not have its declared bearer\nor bearers for that year in\nattendance. If one or both are absent\nContinued at the top of the next\npage...\n\n"

    "content": "Students Strike Back\nImperial College Union will encourage students not to cross\npicket lines during next week's College-wide strike. Yesterday's Extraordinary General Meeting\n( EG M) saw a motion passed\nsupporting the action by College\nstaff upset by proposals to make all\nCollege messengers and security\nstaff redundant.\nThe strike will take place on Wednesday4 th December to\ncoincide with a meeting of the\nGoverning Body which controls the\nrunning of the College. Every trade\nunion in College will take part in\nthe action, except the AUT( Association of University Teachers) and NAL GO( National\nAssociation of Local Government\nOfficers). The AUT has instructed\nits members not to cross picket lines\nand NAL GO is holding a ballot\ntoday which is expected to support\nthe dispute.\nSteve Newbold, the College\nManagement Negotiater, criticised\nthe Students Union motion saying\nthat parts of it were 'frankly\nincorrect'. Mr Newbold continued\nby saying that there were to be two\nmore meetings between the trade\nunions and College management\nbefore any decision was made. He repeated that any 'cost cutting\nalternative' would be considered.\nThe Guardian covered the dispute\nafter re cie ving a letter from Professor Sayers, the Dean of City\nand Guilds College, which contained serious criticisms of the\nproposed redundancies. Professor\nSayers was contacted by Felix, but\ndid not wish to comment further.\nHe said that the matter was now an\nissue for staff and trade unions. Mr Steve Newbold commented that the\nletter had created negative publicity\nfor College and the individuals\nconcerned.\nOther criticism has come from\nmembers of the Computing Department. In reply to a letter they\nsent to the Rector, he will be\nmeeting a representation from the\nDepartment on Monday. Members\nof the committee were not willing\nto comment further.\nProfessor Shaw, Chairman of the\nAcademic Staff Assembly, has also\nwritten to the Rector and is still\nawaiting a reply. His letter claims\n'a profound loss of confidence in\nCollege Management' among staff\nmembers. He told Felix that his\nletter had encountered no disagreement among staff who had\nseen it.\nThe Rector, Sir Eric Ash, said\nthat management of the College had\nchanged recently and that the\ncommunication of Management\nproposals had been 'less than\nperfect.' He was not surprised that\nstaff were concerned about the\nproposals, but said in response to\nthe ICU motion (see story on EG M) that it was 'rather bizarre' that\nstudents felt they could achieve\nanything by not going to lectures.\nHe confirmed that no concrete\nalternatives had come from the\ntrade unions, but he 'sincerely\nhoped they would.'\nDoors Down and Out Loans\nA door to the Union Building was\ncompletely shattered last Friday by\nthree Royal School of Mines (RSM)\nstudents pushing a British Rail\ntrolley through it. The incident\noccurred at around 11.20pm during\na bar extension to to mark the end\nof Rag week.\nThe damage to the door has been\nestimated at around \u00a3400 and the\nUnion is hoping to claim some\nmoney towards the cost of replacement from those who did the\ndamage. Zoe Hellinger, Union President, commented that 'the\nUnion cannot continue to pay out\nfor any damage caused to the\nbuilding at the moment. Every\nweek we have to spend some money\non the gent's toilets and I am very\nconcerned that it is not the students\ndoing the damage'. She also stated\nthat it has been discussed to put a special fund in next year's budget\nto pay for damage to the building.\nHowever, this would mean that\nfunding to clubs and societies would\nhave to be reduced. A Union disciplinary is being held on Tuesday morning to decide the fate\nof the persons involved.\nApplications for Student Loans\nhave been halted, due to the\nbooking up of interview slots.\nThe Interviews, during which\napplication forms are filled, are' necessary to obtain a loan, and are\ncurrently booked into the New Year. No new bookings are being\ntaken at the moment, and students\nare advised to wait until after the\nChristmas holiday before making an\nappointment.\n\n"

Howson's current\nshow entitled Blind Leading the\nBlind has all the quintessential\nfeatures of his earlier work. Brutal\ncharacters depicting scenes of deprivation and despair through\nimages of religion, anarchy and\nconflict are brought to life by the\nartist's bold use of light, shade and\nline. Many of the exhibits are\nsketches and single portraits later\ndeveloped in full canvasses.\nClever as these are, they only\nemphasise Howson's true talent\nwhich is his work on large\n.canvases. Chaotic scenes at an\nOrange Walk are masterfully\nobserved with fine details, such as\ns at t elite dish on the side of a dilapidated tenement, hinting at\ntheir creator's wit. His crowd\nscenes are inspired and their\ncomplexity breathtaking. The artist's ability is evident and his\nskills of observation superb but at\nthirty-three he is a relatively young\nman to have found his style and be\nsticking to it. His figurative\napproach has changed very little\nthrough the years with only a continual refinement taking place.\nThe thuggish ugliness of his figures\nis perhaps a little more extreme\nthese days but his winning formula\nremains. Undoubtedly Howson's work is appealing despite its\nburlesque cruel face but having now\nbroken through into mainstream\nLondon exhibiting it will be\ninteresting to see if he will challenge\nus with new styles and fresh ideas\nin the years to come.\nBlind Leading the Blind is\nshowing at Flowers East, 199\nRichmond Road, Hackney from\n10th November until 8th December\n1991. Admission is free.\nDuel is the first Annual of the\nnewest Batman series Batman:\nLegends of the Dark Knight which\nfollowed on the same vein as Return\nof the Dark Knight with a blacker\nmore sinister Batman.\nDuel finds Batman returning to\nthe monastery where he received his\nZen training, carrying a large bag.\nAfter talking to his old master\n(shades of Karate Kid) he leaves\nthrough a door revealed to him by\nthe master. Batman then proceeds\nthrough various scenarios, the\nobject of which seems the removal\nof the bag from his possession.\nPossession of the bag or burden is\nthe central subject of the book, as\nhis master says maintenance of possession is most important.\nBatman risks life and limb to\ncontinue to carry the bag, indeed his\nzeal for the task is akin to that\npreached by Ibsen's Brand, despite\nthe disadvantage retaining the bag\nincurs.\nEach scenario is penciled and\ninked by different artists. Rather\nthan disrupting the continuity this\ntechnique highlights the radically\ndifferent nature of each scenario.\nExcellent art is provided by Joe\nQuezada, and Steve Oliff's superb\ncolouring throughout the comic is\nof the highest standard complementing and lifting all the\nartists' work.\nAn insight into the Batman\ncharacter with a very satisfying\nending. Worth a read.\nDuel is a64 page comic costing\n\u00a32.25.\nLeviathan B. Editorial Note:\nIbsen is a famous dead\nScandinavian playwright and\nTefal-head extreme.

He has been\nstruggling valiantly against Union\ndisfavour and appears to be slowly\nconvincing them of the usefulness\nof an editorially free and reasonably\nhigh quality college newspaper. The\nmore student newspapers the better\n- there are too many student unions\nwho consider a newspaper a luxury,\nwhen it is a necessity if the student\nbody is to be well informed. Mr Tinworth has told me of how much\nbetter informed students with\ncollege newspapers were in comparison with colleges without\nnewspapers.\nOdds and Ends\nSomebody has ordered the emplacement of a large metal pipe\nwhich is framing the entrance to the\nFelix Office.

    "content": "Science Felix 919 29 November1991 People\nin glass\nhouses\nshouldn't Last Thursday Dr John Gribbon,\nNew Scientist Physics Correspondent, presented a talk on the\n'Greenhouse Effect'. The Earth has\ntwo types of greenhouse effect\u2014a natural and an anthropogenic\ngreenhouse effect. In the former,\nsolar energy absorbed through the\natmosphere warms the Earth's surface. Infra-red radiation is then\nradiated from the Earth's surface\nand trapped in the atmosphere\nmainly by carbon dioxide and water\nvapour s, thus keeping the Earth\nwarm. The moon, although an\nwhich trap infra-red radiation)\ncarbon dioxide, chl or of lu roca bons( which did not exist until the\n1930s), methane and nitrous oxide.\nUntil the 1980s the temperature\nchange on Earth was not thought to\nbe significant, but the eight warmest\nyears on record have occured in the\npast eleven years, the top four years\nbeing 1987, 1988, 1990 and 1991.\nIndeed, the coldest years of the\n1980s were hotter than the warmest\nyears of the 1880s. All of these changes (which are\nreal\u2014not the result of better\nThrow Stones\nAdam Ward of\nEnvironmental\nand Appropriate\nTechnology\nSociety on the\npotential\ncatastrophe of\nglobal warming.\nequal distance from the sun, has no\natmosphere, no greenhouse effect\nand an average surface temperature\nof \u2014 2 0 \u00b0 C. The Earth has an\naverage surface temperature of15 \u00b0C and so the greenhouse effect\nkeeps the Earth 3 5 \u00b0 C warmer than\nit otherwise would be.\nOver the last 100 years there has\nbeen a rise in the average surface\ntemperature of the Earth of Vi\u00b0C' The sea level has also risen by an\naverage of15 cm, exactly the\namount expected from thermal\nexpansion of the upper ocean layers\nfrom the Vi \u00b0 C temperature rise. In\nthe sub-tropics there has been a decline in rainfall, and in higher\nlatitudes there has been an increase\nin extreme weather. Over the last\ncentury there has also been a dramatic change in the composition\nof the atmosphere including increasing concentrations of the\ngreenhouse gases (i.e. those gases\nmeasuring equipment) are thought\nto be due to the anthropogenic\ngreenhouse effect, that is the extra\nwarming of the planet has been due\nto man's production of more\ngreenhouse gases.\nOver the last one hundred years\nthe atmospheric carbon dioxide\nconcentration has increased by\n25 %, from 280 parts per million to\n350ppm, which is significant,\nconsidering that the former figure\ncontributed to a 'greenhouse effect'\nof 3 5 \u00b0 C. Of the present annual emissions\nof carbon dioxide of 5lh billion\ntonnes, the United States\ncontributes 2 5 % , Britain 3 % and\nChina 10% (illustrating how a small\nproportion of the world population,\ni.e. developed countries, has a disproportionate share of the\nplanet's resources).\nFrom radiocarbon analysis of methane trapped in air bubbles in\nice in the Antarctic, there has been\na dramatic build up of methane in\nthe atmosphere. Methane is\nproduced mainly by bacteria in swamps and the guts of ruminants.\nSome methane is also produced\nfrom degrading waste in landfill\nsites. Methane traps twenty times as\nmuch energy as carbon dioxide\nmolecule for molecule. CFCs are\nlow in concentration in the\natmosphere but are still building up\nrapidly and molecule for molecule\nabsorb 10,000 times as much heat\nas carbon dioxide. Thus carbon\ndioxide is only half of the problem.\nComputer models to predict the\neffects of global warming have been\ncriticised because of differences in\npredicted temperature rises.\nHowever, the difference between\npredictions of a2 \u00b0 C and a4 \u00b0 C temperature rise if the atmospheric\ncarbon dioxide concentration was to\ndouble, is not significant when\nmeasured on the Kelvin scale. The doubling of the pre-industrial\ncarbon dioxide concentration is\npredicted to occur the year 2030\n(assuming a2% annual increase in\ncarbon dioxide emissions) and the\nexpected average temperature rise\nis 3 . 5 \u00b0 C.A similar temperature\nchange occured during the end of the last ice age (10,000 years ago)\nover a4000 year period. However,\nthe predicted 3 . 5 \u00b0 C temperature\nchange will occur in only 40 years,\na rise of about 1 \u00b0 C per decade.\nEcologists studying the adaptation\nand evolution of ecosystems say that\necosystems could perhaps adapt to\na1 \u00b0 C rise per century but not in just\nten years. Therefore by the year\n2 0 3 0 natural un managed ecosystems will be very rare with\nmost ecosystems having to be\nhighly managed.\nSea levels may rise by up to 1\nmetre by the year 2030 leading to\nmany more refugees from coastal\nareas where many farmers in\ndeveloping countries live. In the\nNile Delta this sea level rise would\naffect five million people (assuming\nthere is no population increase) with\n17% of Egypt's agricultural land\nbeing lost to the sea. The deserts of the sub-tropics will spread towards\nthe poles resulting in potential mass\nmigration away from the deserts.\nHurricanes are basically driven by\nheat and as ocean temperatures\nincrease hurricanes will become\nstronger and more frequent in\nhigher latitudes.\nBut, how accurate are these\npredictions? A recent article in the\nNew Scientist (23.11.91) describes\na new theory that a lot of the\ntemperature changes can be\nexplained as solar variation..\nHowever, previous work (see the\nsame article) projected that the\ndownturn in the solar cycle will be\n\u2014 8 \u2014\n\n"

This talk will look at the\nreasons behind the Space Shuttle's development and its patchy operational history; reasons for the\n1986 Challenger disaster and the\nsolutions implemented before the\nresumption of flight operations in\n1988; and what the future may hold\nfor the ten year old space shuttle\nfleet, which has recently notched up\nits 44th flight.\nMany of you will remember Reg\nTurnhill from the early days of the\nSpace Shuttle programme as the\nBBC Children'sTV 'Newsround'\nspace reporter.\nBadminton\nVisiting Cards\nClub Membership Cards\n&\nInvitations\nin the\nUnion Building Foyer\n\u00a33\n-50 small\n-25 large\nThe badminton team has certainly\nhad a smashing start this season.\nWith two men's teams and one\nladies' team, we managed to come\nthrough the first round of the U AU in a truly magnificent fashion. So\nfar, the mens' 2nd team and the\nladies team are unbeaten; while the\nmens' 1st team has lost only one\nmatch.\nLast weekend, we participated in\nthe U AU individuals tournament in\nNottingham University. Our team\nconsisted of six men (R Langford,\nJ Li m,R Jumar, CL Tan,S Trussel, M Francis) and six ladies\nWindsurfing\n( WTa n,B Spence, W Yates, E Fok, U Boltze, C Roberts). Our best result was in the ladies singles\nwhere Wendy Tan got through to\nthe quarter finals before she was\nnarrowly beaten. With40 other\nuniversities participating, the event\nproved to be most enjoyable. We not only experienced the sheer\ncompetitiveness of the game, but a tremendous amount of team spirit\nas we supported and cheered for\neach other.\nAs the season carries on, we have\nhigh hopes to go much further.\nDespite variable winds and heavy\nrain, the windsurfing club managed\nto have a great time in Wales.\nThose of us brave enough to put on\na wetsuit and venture into the sea\nspent Saturday surfing (with Julia\neven venturing to her knees).\nThe compulsory visit to a Welsh\ndisco in the evening was superb, if\nonly for the chance to down a beer\nfor \u00a31.20 a pint and bop away to\nStatus Quo(?!). In contrast to Saturday, Sunday\nwas very windy. Unfortunately, no\none woke up much before lunch\ntime, resulting in a mad rush to the\nsheltered beach. This actually\nconsisted of towering waves, so it\nwas left for Phil, the cool hot shot,\nto go out and do battle. This he did sensationally, barely spending any\ntime on the water and getting\nspectacular air time, whilst Andrew\ngot eaten horribly by a wave and\nresurfaced with a shredded rig.\nAnyway, if cheap beer and the\nchance to wear some mean rubber\nappeals to you, then surf on over to\nthe Southside Upper Lounge,12.30 pm on Tuesday for more\ndetails.\n\u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"
