As far as I know, the Bible does not\nmention abortion but It does\nhave something to say about\nfornication which is the\ncause of most of the problem.\nGod did not make rules to\nirritate and restrict us but\nbecause he knows what is\ngood for us (he was our\ndesigner) and those who\nIgnore the rules will tend to\nsuffer and so will the\nsociety in which they live.\nSo, eliminate fornication and\nthe abortion issue will largely disappear as a fringe benefit.\nTo those who do not\nbelieve in God I would ask them to consider the communist\nrulers of this world. Neither\ndo they believe in God but\nthey are well aware of the\ndangers of sexual immorality\nand have made great progress\nin stamping it out. Yours faithfully,\nBOB PORTER, Aero PG. Mathematical Sir, - In reply to Mr Fitz gerald's defence of the anti-abortion ers, when the\nCatholics were confronted\nwith the problems of contraception they allowed a woman to resort to Mathematics but not to Physics or\nChemistry to prevent a pregnancy. I am sure that a Refectory prices\nSir - IWith reference to the\nletter from Anon, concerning\nrefectory prices published in\nFELIX No.399, may I point\nout that the writer had his facts\ncompletely wrong. He claimed\nto have been under-charged\nto the value of 9p; whereas he\nwas actually charged correctly.\nThe price indicated on the\nmenu (in this case 35p for cod)\nincludes chips or potatoes and\na vegetable. If one does not\nhave chips/potatoes or a vegetable, then their price is\nsubtracted from the cost. Thus\nthe marked price is for a complete main course, and not\njust for the meat/fish as the\nwriter of the letter, believes.\nRegarding the refectory\ndebate, may I state my whole\nhearted agreement with the\narticle by Mike Williams (also\nin FELIX no. 399).\nYours faithfully,\nJJ STUART( Maths I) Room 287,\nKeogh Hall, Prince's Gardens\nabortions Mathematics department as\ncapable as ours should be\nable to produce an equation\nto bring about amiss carriage in anyone. Perhaps\nthis will then relieve Mr\nFitzgerald' s labour ed pains\non this subject.\nYours sincerely,\nRICK PARKER, ICU A AO. \"Refectories'1\n:\nMr Williams' ideas ill-conceived\nSir, \u2014 I enjoy a sharp sensational article, but I make no apologies\nfor the following which is a repudiation of last week's article on\n, \" Refectories\" by M ike Williams. That.was tbe one that began by suggesting that Mr Teague and\nMr Mooney should have their heads banged together (good stuff,\nthat!), be forced to trust each other (no harm in that) and hence\nsolve the refectory economic crisis at a stroke. Mr Mooney would\nraise the quality of his food, and Mr Teague would implore more\nstudents to eat there.\nThe article is ill-conceived on several accounts; in particular\n(a) it is improbable and factually incorrect; (b) it is of doubtful\nidealogical basis. Taking the points in their logical order \u2014 Mr Teague and\nMr Mooney are only two comparatively minor people who influence\nthe refectory price lists. The most important people are undoubtedly. the Rector and his Financial Secretary who must take any\nproposed increases to the Governing Body (for rubber-stamping?)\nMr league put the basic idea Mr Williams was suggesting to\nthese people last summer!! (which lets Pete off the hook and\nthat leaves Mr Mooney banging his head together by himself).\nMr Teague argued that a40% increase would stop people eating\nin the refectories. A20%( say) increase would still mean a loss,\nbut not the devastation a large increase would bring.\nThey replied that even if Mr Mooney could be persuaded\nto make a much smaller increase, and raise his standard of\npreparation (which he insists is already as high as one can expect from refectory catering), they could not endorse such\na suggestion, because they are bound by UGC rules to balance\ntheir accounts. Should they fail, and appear not to have done\ntheir utmost, then I believe that the UGC have a specialty\nprepared ton of bricks which they would lower rapidly onto the\nRector's head.\nWhy would the UGC be unlikely to think that they had not\ntried their hardest if they implemented Mr Williams' s scheme?\nI cannot read their minds, but some simple mathematics suggests\nthat if the price rise had been limited to 20\u00b0h, then at least 3 0 %\n\u2022 more students would have to eat there compared with last year\nto break even on the year!! Secondly I do not totally preclude\nthe idea that we should be prepared to help ourselves by helping\nthe refectories, but I cannot accept the extent to which Mr\nWilliams carries it.\nQuite apart from whether his idea could work, the idealogical\nbasis of Mr Williams' s suggestion is of a debatable nature. It\nseems to me that the refectories should be classed as a service,\nand the service is for them to supply food to students and\nstaff. We are not here to supply the refectory with a service \u2014\nnamely customers, which is what Mr Williams is suggesting\nif his idea is carried to its logical conclusion. To apply an analogy, the students at this college are here\njust to give the staff something to do!\nI wish people would not write:-\" Doubtless the smug little cynics... will point out the\ndifficulties\" when they ' really' mean that they want everyone to\ngive this idea fair consideration\". If anyone reading this feels\nthat it is full of smug cynicism, so be it; but I would-rather I did not feel prejudged.\nAnother point follows on from this: it is obvious from the\narticle that Mr Williams had never suggested this idea to the\npresident or even bothered to check facts with anyone\nexample, the chairman of the Refectory Committee.\nWhy not?\nYours faithfully,\nWA GERRARD. for\nTclix\nFELIX has now been reporting, recording and entertaining Imperial College for nearly twenty-six years. Since\nits birth it has undergone rapid and sometimes severe\nchange, not least being the change from letter-press to\noff-set litho \u2014 a very painful transformation but nevertheless\no< roe which has re vitali sed the paper and interest in it.\nThe very first issue, under the Editorship of EM Hughes\nconsisted of thirteen pages (plus a front cover) of Roneo'd full-s cap, of which 600 copies were printed. They sold out\nby 10.00am! Yes, they were sold in those days for the\nsum of 3 d.I hope that this issue, despite being free , will also go by the same time.\nIn that first issue, the editor announced:\n\"The need has been felt tor some time for a frequently\npublished journal to comment upon the affairs of the College\nwhilst they are still topical, and to bring to the attention\nof its members the activities of clubs and societies of\nwhich people at present know little, and knowing little,\ntend to care even less...\n\"The success or failure of this paper depends principally\nupon you, our readers. In the first place we depend upon\nyou to produce many ot our articles and reports, since our\nstaff cannot themselves attend and report every College\nevent. Secondly we depend upon you to maintain a lively\ncorrespondence in our columns\".\nBoth the sentiments echoed in the above extract still hold good today and more so than ever. Through the pages\nof FELIX you make your ideas, opinions and grievances\nknown to the whole College, be challenged and challenge\non these and other peoples ideas, opinions etc. I hope you enjoy reading this issue.

In addition to this, Rag Week\nwill contain a whole host of weird\nand wonderful events, so get involved\nand make it the success it deserves\nto be.\nThe next event on the ICWA calendar\nafter the \" 2 0 ' s Party' will be a debate\non Tuesday, 18th November at 7.00pm in the ICWA lounge. The riot ian will be 'This house believes that women\nwho are raped ask tor it', in response\nto an article by Jack Gratus which\nrecently appeared in 'Over 2 1 ' magazine.\nMr Gratus, author of ' The Victim', will be defending the riot ion and\nMargaret Allen, features editor of ' The Times' ' will oppose if. (Margaret Alten, you will remember came to college last\nyear to speak to the 'Women in Science\nand Technology' Group on the subject\nof 'Women in Industry'.) We also require\ntwo further speakers (one defending,\none opposing) from College, so if you\nwould like to air your views on the\nsubject at the debate, drop a note\ninto my letter-rack in the Union Office.\nSherry will be provided.\nOn Thursday, 20th November at\n12.30pm, the first ICWA General\nMeeting of the session will take place.\nDuring the meeting, the committee\nwill report to you on its activities to date and events planned for the\nfuture. It is important that all members\nattend so that we know we are spending\nyour money as you would like to see\nit spent. That is, think of it as a share\nholders meeting! Further, the Fresher' s representative for this session will be elected at this meeting. The post\nwill be best filled by someone prepared\nto express her opinions on the present\nrunning of ICWA and also contribute\nsome new ideas. The nomination\npapers are on the Union notice board\noutside the Union Office. On the ICWA\ncommittee there is also a post for one\nmale and we would like any men in\ncollege who thinks he can contribute\nto the running of ICWA to stand for\nthe post. He will need an ICWA nl ember to propose him, the nomination papers\nbeing posted on the Union notice\nboard.\nOn the evening of the 20th November,\nICWA will be holding a Post Graduate\nand Overseas students social evening.\nThe aim of the evening will be to get to\nknow some of the more elusive members\nof college and to discuss what they\nwould like to see us organising on\ntheir behalf, together with any points\nthey may have raised during the General\nMeeting. So if *y. ou are either a postgraduate or an Overseas Student,\nwhether first year or third year, please\nattend. There will be no charge and the\nsocial will take place in the ICWA\nlounge, which for those of you who have\nnot found it as yet, is next to the\nUnion Office on the first floor of the\nUnion Building. It will begin at 6.30pm. The Wednesday lunch time meetings\nof the 'Women in Science and Technology\"\ngroup will continue as usual and as a future event to note, Professor Daphne\nJackson, Professor of Physics at\nSurry, will be coming to speak to the\ngroup on December 4th. Watch this space for further details on that.\nFor those people who are not aware\nof this, there are magazines provided\nin the lounge. These include ' Punch',' Time' and 'New Scientist'. We also hope to be able to provide coffee\nfacilities,. shortly. Finally, make the most of Rag\nWeek and see you at the Debate on\nthe 18th. Stella Godfrey\n\n"

    "content": "Imperial\nThe renaissance of Athletics at Imperial College took\nplace on Sunday 26th October at the West London Stadium.\nSIT the gloomy shadow of Wormwood Scrubs prison approximately 30 enthusiastic athletes competed in seventeen\nfield and track events for ten silver trophies unearthed\nfrom,deep recesses and glittering for the occasion.\nEnthusiasm and a WillingFILIX\nness to try anything once were\nthe order rather than outstanding individual brilliance. Dave\nLord \u2014 something to do with\nCity and Guilds \u2014 should be\nmentioned in the former\ncategory and Ian Ell js, S Golding and Dave West in the\nlatter. Judges and time-keepers\nwere recruited from the\nspectators who included girl. friends, children and a rather\nun savoury tramp and his dog. Due to a lack of competitors\nthe heats were abandoned and\nonly finals were run. The athletic highlight of the\nafternoon was undoubtedly the\n1500 metres which developed\ninto a battle between Ian\nEllis and Paul Clarke. Until\nthe last 200 metres Clarke was leading by fifteen feet,\nhowever Ellis showed his superior stamina and power\nand overtook on the final bend\nto win a well calculated and\ntimed race at a creditably\nfast pace.\nThe water jump in the 3000\nmetres steeplechase was awe\ninspiring. Rain had filled it to\nthe brim and extended its\nlength, the colour of the water\nwas an evil murky green and its\ndepth was indeterminate. Two of spray. The race was won\nvery ser lo.u sly and professionally by Ian Ellis. The tug-of-war was won by\nCity and Guilds. After the\nserious first round between\ntwo 8-man teams from C&G and\nRCS the second round degenerated into a free for all with girl friends and children\nhelping both sides. Apart\nfrom these odd lapses the\ncompetition was very serious\nand the novelty of running on a Tartan track was enjoyed by\nall the athletes.\nThe trophies were awarded\nby John Thornback, Chairman\nof ACC, Congratulations are\ndue to Steve Webb and Ian\nEllis for their excellent\norganisation, to Karen Ryder\nfor keeping the score, to Mrs\nDave West for time-keeping and\nto Barbara Donnelly for her\nvocals. There are no more athletic\nevents connected with the\nCollege until the University of\nLondon Championships early\nin May. It is hoped that many\npeople who competed on\nSaturday will also take part\nin this (IC won last year and\nhope to retain it this year).\ndistinct methods of navigating\nthe jump were utilised. The first was the professional\nmethod, as seen at the Olympics,\nwhere the runner puts one foot\nonto the jump then leaps\ngracefully to land at the edge\nof the shallows with a gentle\nsplash. The second and most\ncommon method \u2014 as used by\nPad Donnel ly \u2014 was to clamber onto the bar using both hands\nand feet, to gain their balance,\ngrin an thr opold ally then crouch\nas though building up immense\npower for take-off. The resulting epi to my of athletic\nprowess would then jump\nhalf-hearted ly, stumble on\nImpact and fall in two feet of\nfree z ing water send I ng up sheets\nThere is also a very active\nCross Country Club at IC and\nanyone wanting to keep fit\nduring the winter Is strongly\nencouraged to join (they also\ndo some road running and re lays;\nit's not all slogging through\nmi fdl). Fixtures are advertised\non their notice board just\noutside the union cloakroom.\nSome members of the Club also take part in Open Athletic meetings throughout the\nwinter and hope to enter some\nIndoor races this season.\nDetails of these events will be posted on their notice board\nor anyone interested should\ncontact the Club via the\nInternal mail ie Union Letter\nrack.\nGames\nRESULTS\n400m Hurdles 1 D West, 58.5;\n2 P Clarke,71.9100 m1V Farewell, 11.7;\n2 S Golding 11.7\n800m1I Ellis205.5;2 S Littlewood 2.10.3\n2000m walk 1 D Lord 11.09;\n2 M Welford 11.50\n1500m1IEl lis4.19.8;2P Clarke,4.24.63000 mS C1IEl lis11.072P Johnson 12.35\n200? 1 D West 23.8;\n2 V Farewell 25.0\n400m1D West 55.0;\n2 D Lord 57.0\n4x100 relay 1 C& G47.9;2R CS51.04x400 relay 1 C& G3.53.9;2RC S4.06.5 Discus1 G Chai dle r96'2</2\";2P McCullagh 9 1 ' 1 0 \"\nLong Jump 1 D West 19' 1 \" ;\n2 S Golding 18' 1 0 \"\nJavelin1S Golding 127' 1 \" ;\n2 E Heald 124' 6 \" .\nHigh Jump 1 S Golding 1m75;2C Mathers 1 m60 Shot 1 P McCullagh 30' 2 \" ;\n2 S Golding 30' 0 \"\nTriple Jump 1 S Golding 43' 3 \" ;\n2 P Novak 4 1 ' 6 \"\nTug-of-war - City and Guilds College res ut:1 Guilds,2 RCS,3 S Littlewood,\n4 Mines\n\n"

The review for\nthe end of this term is now getting under\nway, and I have been asked for the\nstudents' views on several points. One\nof the main ones is the standard of\ncleaning in the Halls. The wage Bill for\nthe Halls forms quite a high proportion of\nthe total outgoing s.I have been asked\nwhether the students feel that the Hall rooms are cleaned too often and whether\nit is necessary for students to have their\nbeds made for them every day.Many\nstudents like to have their cleaner I know, but it must be realised that the\ncleaner costs each student in Hall about\n\u00a33 per week. If we want to keep the\ncleaning at its present level we must\nrealise that it has to be paid for. I would\nappreciate any comments or suggestions\non this topic.\nPostgraduates\nThe college has set up a working\nparty, under the chairmanship of Prof\nPearson, Chem Eng, to investigate\nPostgraduate Education at IC including\narrangements made for PG s in both the\nacademic and social context. I was asked\nto nominate three PG s to sit on the\nworking party, and I am still at the time\nof writing looking for a girl on an Msc\ncourse in RCS or Mines to attend. If\nanyone would tike to, please come and\nhave a chat with me about it (Phone\nInternal 2488).\nAnyone can make submissions to the\nworking party, so if you would like to\ncomment on any facet of your PG Education,\nnow is the time to do it.\nRefectories\nI was most interested in the article\non Refectories by Mike Williams in the\nlast issue of FELIX. Perhaps he will excuse this \" smug cynic\" for pointing\nout the difficulties. First, I do not want to\nsee the refectories closed, or the prices\nincreased at Christmas, however, I feel\nthat students should be deciding whether\nthe food in the refectories is good value\nfor money. If they feel it is not then of\ncourse they should eat elsewhere.\nSecondly, the main point around which\nMike's solution revolves is an improvement in the quality. I agree that the\nquality should be improved and I have\nsaid that if this were done I feel more\npeople would use the refectories. Mike\nomitted an essential first step in his\nargue ment however, that is; Mr Mooney\nmust admit that the quality of food\nleaves room for improvement. This he\nresolutely refuses to do, saying for\nexample, \"A good chip to one person is\nnot necessarily a good chip to another.\"\nThe End\nI look forward to some reaction from\nthis article. Keep smiling, and have a good Rag Week.\nMutters\nArising\n'Mutters' takes to the air once more.\nConsistent with tradition, it seems, this\nepistle bears tidings of elections.

The decision to set-up\nan alternative refectory was\ntaken at the first U GM when\nthe Union found that prices had been increased by an\naverage of 70% without their\nbeing consulted.\nSince then, the refectory\nhad been making a \u00a3600 loss every week.\nThe Union's self-catering\nwas carried out, with equipment\nhired, in the gymnasium and\nprovided up to 300 meals a day. The average cost of a main course was in the\nregion of 25p as opposed to\n46p in the College's refectory.\nThe Union's president, Mr\nWayne Philpott says that\nthey have broken even over\nthe period (month of October)\nin which the system was\nrunning.\nA report by Mr Philpott on\nthe refectory set-up at QE C was circulated to all the\nprofessors and members of\nthe Union Council. As a result the College decided to\nlower prices \u2014 a46p main\ncourse now costs 32p. The\nnumber of people using the\nrefectory has risen dramatically\nand it is on this factor that\nthe QE C Union is resting its case. It is hoped that the\nincreased turnover will keep\nlosses to well below the\n\u00a3600 mark. Mr philpot tis satisfied with the way the\nproblem has been resolved,\n\"I'm pleased to see that the\nCollege has given up trying\nto break even on the refectory\nand I hope this sets a trend tor\nthe future\", he said.\nGovernment statistics would\nput this element at \u00a3420 for\nLondon.\nBirmingham\nRag Queen picket\nWestfield\nHighest\nhall fees\nStudents at Westfield\nCollege are paying \u00a3481.50\na year for a single room.

In my\nopinion the horse is facing the wrong\nway.\nThe titles of the songs suggest, well\nenough, what they are concerned with,\nranging from the country and western\nfeel of 'Love is Everywhere' (sic), the\necological 'Looking For Space', 'Fly\nAway' (which includes our own Olivia New'on Squirel singing vocal harmony)\nwith its ' let's get away from the hustle\nof the city to the sands and the sea' fruitcake sh muck. There is even a tribute to Captain Cousteau and his crew of amiable sailors of the good\nship 'Calypso'. The arrangements\ngiven to the songs are as bland as the\nlyrics they ens cons e. Which with all things considered,\nleaves 'Windsong' an undoubted success with much of the record-buying public -the album is already top of the American\nChart and fast rising in our own. But for\nme, the only 'Windsong' this album\nsuggests, is the kind of anal disturbance\none gets from a baked bean overdose.\nIan Morse\nFOCUS - 'Mother Focus' (Polydor):\nFocus have been laying rather low\nthese past few years after their sudden\nrise to fame following the singles success of \"Hocus - Pocus\", with a lengthy\npost \u2014 \" Focus3\" silence and the\nunexceptional \"Hamburger Concerts\"\nalbum. They haven't been over-enthusiastic\nto return to the forefront of the music biz, and, much in that vein, the new album\ncomes across as a satisfied, restrained\neffort from the number one Dutch group.\nThey' ve injected a little bit of 'funk'\ninto the style through bassist Bert\nRuiter's writing and playing.\n\"/ need a bathroom\" resembles\nBudgies \"Who do you want for your love\"\nfrom the new \"Bandolier\" album (that's a plug) \u2014 and it sounds just funky \u2014 the\nbass thudding away over the energetic\ndrumming that gives the track life.\n\"Bennie Helder\" could easily have come\nfrom their \"Moving Waves\" with it's classically \u2014 oriented feel and easy\ngrace. The strength of this band is that\ntheir songs still revolve around a strong\ncentral melody with the embellishment\nas extra, unlike so much music these\ndays comprising solely of frills and no\nsubstance, sometimes with excessive success. Atrocious as it seems, this is an easy-listening album \u2014 not the Man to van i/ James\nLast br yl cree m sludge greased onto\nvinyl \u2014 more a smooth, refined approach\nto producing low-volume music. The band produces a' full' sound - steady\nunobtrusive rhythmic bass/drum collages\nwith the main theme gliding through on\nsynthesizer, organ, or guitar.\n\"Trdpic bird\" is the most beautifully\nfragile piece on the album \u2014 a soft, flow-ing, French sound, ideal for the opening\nor closing moments of a film like\n\"Emmanuelle\" - in short, pretty neat. It\nmight not get your rocks off but it' ll grab\nthe ladies.\nThis is such an understated album that\nit probably won't go far chart wise, but\nthat's just as well because it should\nbecome one of those cherished, unknown\nalbums that finds itself a special place\nin collections. The racy guitar solos and\ndemented Van Leer vocal noises have\nmellowed out and the sharp edges have\nbeen smoothed down but a compositional\nstrength has taken it's place, although\ntwo sides of this can't do for the c irc ul ation what one good Page riff or inspired\nSantana solo are capable of. What this\nalbum really needs are a couple of head\nbustin-rockers where the musicians\nallow themselves to let rip. Nevertheless, if modesty is a virtue,\nFocus are in line for medals. They might\ndoze off in the middle of the next album,\nthough.\nHie\n\"Get Down\" by Joe Simon (Polydor)\nOnce upon a time, a FELIX editor\nwas given a record, by Joe Simon, to\nreview. This record contained such\nmasterpieces as \" Get Down, Get Down\n(Get On The Floor)\", and, \"It Be's That\nWay Sometimes.\" Several seconds after\nthe a fore mentioned FELIX editor had\nlowered the needle onto the record, he\ndecided to be kind and pass the said\nrecord on to somebody else. Eventually he found the right person \u2014\nhe saw a corpse wearing a dirty old light\nbrown hat. To this person he did give the\nrecord.\nThe hat has two musical loves; a) Kilbrun and the High Roads and b) the\nARP Oddessey synthesizer:he did, however find \"It Be's That Way Sometimes\",\nextremely good - quite to his liking in\nfact - he even did like the first few\nseconds of \"Fire Burning\". The hat does\nnot, however, find that type of musical\nextravagance called \"Soul Muzik\", to\nhis taste - and thus despite the fact that\nall aspects of production \u2014 mixing,\nplaying of instruments etc \u2014 are very\nwell done, he does tend to turn green at\ntoo much of it.\nMONEY SPINNERS Sat 8 Nov\nIC adv 90pAD V \u00a31 DOOR \u00a3110\nSat |5 Nov\nFILM Thurs 2 7 Nov\n& SPARROW\nCLEAR LIGHT ORCHESTRA IC adv \u00a3 1 1 0 Adv \u00a3 1 - 2 0 on door \u00a31 30\nTHE 0<flY OF THE eJ A Ef tfl bM L22O630 J Qp FRIDAYS\nmm\nUnion Lower Refectorv\n8pm TIEKETS AVAILABLE from IC Union 1 2 - 3 0 - 1 3 - 3 0\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 15\nRecords\nPeanut butter melts in path of FELIX reviewer whilst\nfrog gies spawn ecstatic response\nMagma - Magma Live (RCA, Utopia)\nWljh the release of this double-album Magma prove conclusively that\ntogether with Can and Weather Report,\n\"they are amongst the formost musical\ninnovators working in the ever-widening\ncontext of rock.\nThe seam ln gly perpetually changing\nline-up of the French band led by\nvirtuoso drummer, Christian Vander, for\nthis record consists of two keyboard\nplayers, bass, guitar, violin and two\nvocalists, one of which is Vanders'\nwife, Stella, and its with the violin and\nsap rano voice recently added to the\nband where Magma succeed in making\nperhaps their finest recorded work to data Listening to this record, I'm of the\nopinion that the band seem to achieve\nthe sort of musical ec stacy that somehow always seemed to elude,for instance,\nthe late lamented King Crimson. Comparisons can be made throughout\nthis album with Crimson's' Larks Tongues In Aspic', each reaching a musical climax after humble origins.\nBut where as KC' s climax was derived\nfrom purely sexual inspiration, Magma\nachieve an ethereal majesty in their\nmusic, quite unlike any band playing\ntoday.\nThe first album Is taken up with\n'Kohntark', a sombre, all-powerful\npiece conjuring up visions of some\nmacabre initiation ceremony, at times\nclose to Wagnerian construction as regards the use of the two voices.\nThe second record opens up with the\nmost easily accessible song 'Kobah'\nwhich is really a piece of complex\nfunk, Vander on percussion showing\nhis acute sense of space. This is\nfollowed by the beautifully melodic\n'Lihns', which is a feature for the\nfine strong vo;ce of Klaus Bias quiz. The side ends with 'Hhai', which could\nalmost be Zapparesque in. origin, taken\nat a breakneck three-eight pace, its\nnot too di similar to Uncle Frank's legend ry' Kingkong'. For me Magma reach their musical\npeak with the final cut, which takes up\nthe whole of side four. The' piece\nentitled 'Mekanik Zain', demonstrates\nall the power and the glory that is.\nMagma's music, the violin and guitar\nsoaring above the amazing driving\ncomplexities of the rhythm section. I don't think I 've ever heard anything\nplayed with such conviction in rock\nmusic.\nThroughout the album the* musician ship is little short of brilliant, Vander\nin particular showing why he is regarded\nas possibly the finest drummer to come\nout of Europe. Anyone interested in the\nadvance of contemporary rock music\nshould at least give this album a listen. John Denver - Windsong (RCA)\nIf I were the ache ty pal' All American\nboy', bred on molasses and too much\nmothers milk, believed that the world\nwas a beautiful place full of beautiful\npeople and California was the promised\nland \u2014 but above all appreciated\nmusical diarrhoea, I'd probably like\nJohn Denver. As fate would have it,\nI was born a Welshman, live in one of the\nmost violent cities in the Western world,\nhave been ripped-off by numerous\npenny-thieving bastards and due to\nrising inflation cannot afford to suffer\nfrom any form of acute musical flatulence,\nand I dislike John Denver.\nContinued on page/?\nTheatre\n'Pilgrim and 'A Little Black Magic' at\nthe Roundhouse, Chalk Farm.\nPilgrim is quasi-rock musical version\nof Christian's journey from the City of\nDestruction to the Celestial City. It is\nbased of John Bunyan's tale from\nPi Igrims Progress.\nPaul Jones stars as Christian in a musical which threatened to stifle\nitself in the first act by sticking too\nrigidly to the original story line.However,\nit is rescued from this by a very solid and just short of powerful\" performance\nby Paul Jones who sings with gusto\nand fer v our. He is ably supported by Peter\nStraker as A polly on, Paul Nicholas as Talleative and Joanna Carlin as\nChristian's wife. The vocal talent ol these three backed with that of the\nrest of the company makes the musical\nreally come alive.\nThroughout, there is cohesion and\nteam work which is characteristic of\na Prospect Theatre production.Imaginative\ncostumes for A polly on( Peter Straker\nnearly steals the show in this role as\nhe careers from one vocal limit to\nanother) and thoughtful use of the\nlimited stage also add to the whole\nshow.\nTomorrow is the last night of this\nmusical and if you are not already\nengaged I would recommend this show\nto you. You jean get to the Roundhouse\nquite easily b v tube (Chalk Farm) and\nstudents receive a30p discount on all seats except those at 70p. If after this, you feel like more\nentertainment, then you can wait the\nhalf hour or so to see Peter Straker\nin a one-man cabaret show, A Little\nBlack Magic. This also finishes tomorrow\nnight.\nAfter his somewhat exhausting\nperformance in Pilgrim as A polly on he manages to be completely refreshing\nand exciting in a ninety-minute show\nthat swings from the almost false\ngait y of the thirties to the bleak\nseventies.\nHis depth and range of vocals has\nnot been heard this side of the Atlantic since Shirley Bassey last visited these\ndamp isles. Straker is such a talented\nartist and performs with wit, style and\nintelligence that all I can say is just\ndon'ts ii reading this, go and see it\nnow!' You might even be lucky and get\na Brack Magic chocolate \u2014 after all, that is what the admission fee pays for!\nPaul Ekpenyong\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company in\n\"Too True To Be Good\", by George\nBernard Shaw, at the Aldwych Theatre.\nOne of the difficulties of Shaw's plays is that one is never certain how\nfar they will go before the plot breaks\ndown and the torrents of idealistic reflection begin to flow. In \"Too True to\nbe Good\" we are well into the second\nact before he gets down to the real heart\nof the matter, and from there to the end\nof the third act it is pretty tough going.\nThere is enough variation to keep the\ncorrespondence columns of \"The Times\"\nbusy for months \u2014 war, medicine, women,\nreligion and the discovery that immense\nriches do not lead to immense happiness.\nFor sheer theatrical effectiveness\nthe production deserves full marks. Ian\nMcKellen, as the clergyman ex-airman\nturned burglar with, a penchant for\nsermon ising, holds the audience spell bound. Ralph Kol ta i's sets are a' bit overpowering, particularly for the third\nact which takes place at the foot of a cliff supposedly hewn out to some\nsemblance of St Paul's, though which\nresembled nothing so much as a piece of\ndistorted perspex.\nKen Wynne opens the play as a disconsolate microbe convinced that the\nyoung lady, lying in her sick-bed, is\nresponsible for his having the German\nmeasles. It is parts like that, and that of\nPrivate Meek, who turns out to have had\nmore experience of army life than we\nsuspected, that make this play worthwhile,\nif you find the rhetoric hard to take.\nJudi Dench and Anna Calder-MarshalI\nplay the chambermaid turned nurse and\nthe respectable young lady who, together\nwith Mr McKellen, set out to enjoy\nthemselves with the proceeds of the sale of a valuable necklace. They finally\narrive, disguised as Countess Val brion i, her maid and her brother, at a secluded\ndesert beach where the British Army is in\nthe act of subduing brigands, whom they\nbelieve to be holding the young lady\nkidnapped. Fun is had with Meek,\napparently modelled on Aircraftsman\nShaw (or Lawrence of Arabia), who\nwields more power than the colonel\nwhose sole interest is in water colouring, the only occupation of the British admired\nby the Union of Federated Sensible\nSocieties. Finally the play arrives at the\nbottom of the cliffs, where the clergyman's father appears from nowhere. He is an\natheist and his voice is amplified from\nthe back of the auditorium to confuse the\naudience still further. The cast depart\nto their preordained fates whilst the\npreacher declaims from his makeshift\npulpit until he is enveloped in fog and\nhis voice is lost.\nIf the plot is weak then it is because\nShaw was more interested in using his play as a vehicle for polemics. The performance is strong and is well worth\nseeing. The play is on at the Aldwych unti i the end of this month, and students\ncan take any seat in the'house available half-an-hour before the performance for\n70p. Tom Stevenson\n\n"

For Clementine II and the\nR SMU, it is an opportunity\nto take to the road, and go for\na spi n down the A23 with\nthousands of cheering people\nhelping her on the way.\nThe event started at the\nunearthly hour of 8.30am at\nHyde Park Corner, when all the official entries storm off\ndown the road. There was a range of expressions on the\nfaces of the drivers (from\nextreme displeasure to shear\namazement) when a gleaming\nyellow and black commercial\nvehicle, carrying 8 Miners\nand two crates of light ale\nwent roaring past them in the\ndirection of Brighton (No -we didn't get lost). Since\nC lem was not an official\nentry we were supposed to\nmeet ' Bo( which was an\nofficial entry) on Westminster\nBridge. However, since being\nlate at every event is a privilege afforded to the RS M, we decided to set off 15\nmins behind ' Bo( and J ez which also came along for\nthe ride).\nWith Howard \" Hot Rod\" Cheetham at the wheel a15 min deficit was eaten away\nin no time (as were the clu th plates!). Passing' Bo25 miles out of London, we\nstopped for a rendezvous only\nto find that C lem wouldn't start\n(the turbocharger was playing\nup again). The trouble was\nsoon diagnosed by John\n(the RSM Grease Monkey) as\nbeing the rotor arm having\ngone astray. Putting the brain\ncell into top gear, we came\nup with some silver paper\nwhich soon had C lem singing\naway sweetly. Having caught\nup with ' Bo and J ez again,\nC lem went tearing into the\nlead about 15 miles out from\nBrighton. The seating arrangement was then readjusted so\nthat Nick\" Vampire\" Brayshaw could sit on the roof\nwaving to the now' ecstatic verges (we thought they were\ngoing to rush the pitch). This plan was soon shot up the\na \u2014e when we were pulled up\nby the law. Having got of\nthe roof we carried on regard less and Nick got back on the\nroof again, (the boy's a fool)\njust outside Brighton. Then,\nthe moment we had al I be\nwaiting for - C lem arrived at\nthe front \u2014 to be told to clear\noff by the law who wouldn't let us go down to the Prom.\nNot daunted by this minor\nsetback we went down the other\nend of the Prom and ot in\nthere by telling the law we\nwere an official \" tender\". Having parked, the gal rant\nMiners went off in search of\nrich suckers (ie people to\nbuy Rag Mags). Persuading\nO AP's that they want to\nread a book of dirty jokes/ pic s is no easy task, I can\ntell you! Next on the agenda (after\na round of greasy fish and\nchips and the rest of the light\nale) was the inter C CU\" dodge m com petit on\". Needless to say\nMines emerged victorious by\nramming everything within a hundred yard radius of the\ndodge m track.\nWe decided to return to the\nMetropolis (after being skinned\n45p for a stick of rock) by\nwhich time it was semi-dark,\nand we were semi p. \u2014 d. The\ngentleman, who designed C lem many years ago wants shooting,\nas we found out when trying to\ndrive up the motorway with a torch to guide us. The lights*\ndon't even illuminate the\nradiator cap! Talking of radiator\ncaps, C lem developed a little\noverheating problem and we\nused about 10 gallons of water\nto keep afloat. X)n reaching\nLondon, C lem thought it had\nbehaved itself for long enough\nand decided we no longer had\nany use for its clutch (well we\ncertainly didn't get any more\nuse out of it). So it was that\nHoward, in his desperate\nattempts to get us away at a set\nof lights ignored the lane\nmarkings and caused a pile-up\nbehind us. Enough is- enough we all cried, and so the gallant crew\nreturned to South Ken (at a majestic 3mph) in time for the\nlast pint in the Union bar,\nafter putting C lem to bed.\nNOTICE The Dramatic Society wishes to announce Its revised\ncharges for loan of equipment to non \u2014 SCAB clubs.

An experienced Rosslyn Park side inflicted the heaviest defeat the\nA's had experienced for two seasons. However, things were not\nas black as they may appear from the score. Rosslyn Park did not have it all their own way and IC were desperately unlucky.\nIC had a disastrous start to\nthe game, giving away a try\nduring the first few minutes.\nThere was worse to come.\nAlmost' immediately Gwyn\nDavies had to leave the field\nwith an injured arm. That\nde moral is ed the A's and\nRosslyn Park seized their\nchance and ran in six tries\nbefore half time. However, the\nA's finished the half well with\nRich Jenner following up\nquickly from a five yard scrum\nto gain an opportunist try. That\nleft IC 28 \u2014 4 down.\nIn the second half the A's completely changed their\nattitude and started to press u rise the opposition. For some twenty minutes Park were\nforced to defend in their own\ntwenty-five. However, this\nperiod bore no fruit and was\nended by a Park breakaway try\ncaused by a dreadful mistake\nby the A's backs. The game\nthen became more open and in\nthe final twenty minutes the\nA's scored through a good\npiece of back play supported\nby Chris Becque who chipped\nthe ball through to score\neasily. The final try was scored\nby Park in the last minute\nwhen the A's were down to\nthirteen men due to Rich Jenner\ngoing off with a leg injury.\nIn the end, defeat, but not\nhumiliation, for an IC side of\nfourteen men that had a run of\nunbelievably bad luck and had\npress uri seda much heavier\nRosslyn Park pack. No mean\nachievement.\nMany thanks to all who\nturned out, including the A's supporter.\nTeam: N Morton, J Pitcher,\nBLeeson*, L Davies, G Davies\nH Duncan, B Bubb, R Edney,\nM Zawaratco, R Porter, C Imperial College A's:26 East London 4th:6 At 1 2 . 3 0 Jon Pitcher made his fastest run of the day. It was a run of about 400 yards, not, actually, to collect a perfect pass\nbut to collect a lazy number eight plus a set of shirts. As usual,\nespecially when there is ho opposition,' Jon made it and returned\ngripping Rich Jenner who swore that the notice had stated 12.45\nputting the fourteen men who had turned up at 1 2 . 1 5 firmly in\nthe wrong.\nHaving sorted that out we\nth ought our troubles were over\nfor the day but then we saw\nthe pitch. It was the right\nsize, all right, and more or\nless flat, but there were cows\nall over it treating it with that\ncasual disrespect so particular\nto cows. As, once again, we\nhad turned up half an hour\nearly there was plenty of time '\nto deal with the cows before\nkick off.\nSoon after start it was obvious that we were going. to have a hard game. The opposition seemed to be more\nconcerned with trying to cripple\nus than with trying to play a good game of rugby. The IC\npack- dominated the game\nthroughout but our backs\n(d is orientated by an exceptionally wide pitch - perhaps the\nbetter to accommodate the\ncows) made many mistakes.\nIC opened the scoring when\nDave Turner dropped a goal,\ncompensating for some less\nsatisfactory dropping during\nthe game. Very soon after that\nwe lost the lead. A series of\nmistakes let East London\nthrough for a try which they\nconverted easily. IC went\nstraight back at them and\nsoon the lead changed hands\nagain. Our forwards won the\nball and after some good\ninter passing gave it to Bob Lesson who scored a fine try,\nhis first this season. The second half opened\nwith IC leading 9 - 6 , but it\nwas not until Dave Turner\nkicked a penalty that East London started to lose heart.\nFrom then on we were al I over them and in the final\ntwenty minutes we ran in three\ntries, one by Nick Morton and\ntwo by Al Harery (playing\nhooker). That gave a final\nscore of 26\u20146 in our favour.\nIt is always satisfying to\nbeat a team like East London\nby playing good rugby instead\nof reverting to all in t huge ry. Every man of the A's pi aye d his part and played it well. The forwards had a particularly\ngood game and nobody would\nbegrudge Rod Porter and John\nFishburn a mention. The backs\nstood up well to some vicious tackling, and it is a wonder\nthat Chris Becque and John\nPitcher were still on their\nfeet at the end of it all. Team:- N Morton; L Davies;\nB Leeson; C Becque; J Pitcher; D Turner; H Duncan;\nB Bubb; AI Harery; S Downing;\nC Cuthbertson; R Porter; M Siomiak, R Jenner; J Fishburn.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nReviews Concerts\nBurlesque\nBURLESQUE - exciting\nIf taken in the right context Burlesque's concert for the Jazz Club on Sunday 26th October was probably the\nmost exciting and enjoyable musical\nperformance witnessed at IC this term.\nFrom their first number \"Gorilla Crunch\"\nit was obvious that Burlesque were a band with a certain difference. Their\nmusic held its roots firmly in the same\nground as Frank Zappa and it was\nrefreshing to hear music of this kind\nperformed with so much conviction and\ntalent. It was impossible to fault them,\nalthough I tried very hard. One by one\naach of the five musicians proved his\nskill. The lead guitarist played with\nthe energy o_ John McLaughlin, continually turning out rif s of such complexity\nit was hard to believe that they were a band without a following of millions yet alone a record contract.\nAlthough it was obvious they were\nstrongly influenced by Zappa they only\nplayed one number composed by him. In\nthis the drummer who beforehand had\nremained anonymous,\nby his drum kit, produced a solo which\neven Billy Cobham himself would have\nbeen proud of. The number was \"Road\nLadies\" from Chmfs\\'.$. Revenge and\nthe band seemed to have a strong preoccupation with ladles of any kind\nwhich added strong interest to the\nlyrics of their songs.\nThe only disappointing part of the\nevening was the small size of the\naudience. If Jazz Club had arranged for\nthe bar to be open some of_ the 200\ninhabitants of the Union bar at this time\ncould have enjoyed this musical feast.\nBurlesque obviously had a strong effect\non most people there and John Downs\nwas heard to say that they were \"Cosmic Man\". Well even if they were,\nthey were also the most enjoyable\nband to be seen so far this year, and all for free.\nAll is not lost If you missed this\nconcert for Burlesque are playing support\nto George Melly on 22nd November In the\nGreat Hall. Go along and witness what\npromises to be the most entertaining\nconcert at IC this year.\nMagma at the New Victoria Theatre\nMagma came, saw and deafened a meagre audience on the oo cass ion of\ntheir only British concert date prior\nto a European and American tour.\nHowever, do not despair, they are\ncoming back early next year for a concert tour.\nMagma are a French group, one of\nthe early underground progressives,\nwho have now won wide acclaim in\nFrance and Europe but have as yet to\nbreak through in this country. They\nhave released two or three albums the\nlatest of which Magma Live, is reviewed\nin these pages.\nThey have a musical language of\ntheir own and it is quite something to\nsee them performing on stage. Their\nmusic is completely enveloping and\nfrighteningly raw and basic. That is not\nA new musical experience\nsay the music is not well played but\nin fact so well executed that in its\nfinal climax it threatens to tear one\nand all asunder.\nThe musical inspiration of the\ngroup comes from their drummer, Christian Vander, who is at the focus of all their music from writing to playing.\nHe gave one of the most nightmarish\ndrumming solos I have yet witnessed\nto date and yet delivered it with a total\nsincerity and dedication that almost\ncatches one un awa res.\nAt the climax of their performance\none gets the feeling, perhaps due to the\nprimeval nature of the music and its\nlanguage, ko bai an, that one is watching\na kind of satanic rite with the group\ntotally involved and unaware of their\naudience to the point where it would\nseem that they were superfluous. They\nbuilt up to such a violent crescendo\nthat the New Victoria Theatre reverberated\nquite considerably.\nAnd yet, they play with finesse\ncombining percussion with vocals, with electronic chorus and making use\nof violin in place of lead guitar to\nproduce a sound that leaps at you with\nforce. The bass player is un forget able in his style and almost frenzied playing\nof his instrument \u2014 it is a small miracle\nhis fingers do not get caught in the\nstrings.\nFor a new musical experience I would suggest you go and see them\nwhen they next visit Britain or content\nyourself with their latest album, Magma\nLive, which goes some way to capturing\nthe way they play on stage.\nRecords\nBARCLAY JAMES HARVEST - Time\nHonoured Ghosts (Polydor):\nThis is the latest album from a band\nwho have been doing the rounds for a long time now, and built up quite a following in the process. They are all competent musicians, yet lack the\ninventive and innovative talents that\nelevate groups above 2nd division status.\nAttempting to bring together styles originated by other artists, they think\nthat by using the best moments from said\npieces and combining them, a worthwhile\nend-product will be found. It doesn't work\nand only results in BJ H having no\nparticular 'sound' of their own.\n\"In my life\" is the best song on the\nalbum \u2014 a'yes' sty led composition\nwith tasteful, flowing guitar work from\nJohn Lees.\" Swee f Jesus\" sounds too\nmuch like a dirge but nevertheless\ncontains another good Lees solo. Of\ninterest is a track called 'Titles', whose\nlyrics are made up completely from the\nnames of old Beatles' standards. The\nrest of the album is consistent if\nunexciting and the tracks are not worth\nmentioning individually. Suffice to say\nthat Lees, Holroyd, Wolstenholme do\ntheir job as best they can yet the songs\ndo not reach the standard of the playing.\nIt's not an album to make un converted listeners interested in the band, either\nlive or recorded, but it has a certain hazy\npastoral charm \u2014 solidly dependable' English' music which doesn't expect you\nto listen too hard and contains few\nsurprises. There's a nice cover job done\nby Bill Dare (take a bow) oozing with a warm countryside atmosphere \u2014 many\noranges and glowing reds which complement\nthe music contained \u2014 the type of cover\nthat would stand out if you were browsing\nthrough a record rack. As with so many releases, if you don't expect too much this record will satisfy,\nbut records nowadays, are so pricy that\nthe buying public probably looks for\nsomething special rather than an ordinary\nLP. BJ H fans wont be disappointed.\n\n"

Having reached a decision on these\npoints, we fertilise a human egg with any\nhuman sperm in a test tube, remove its\nnucleus and instead inject into the egg a Harold Wilson, Feinberg or neo-Monroe\nnucleus extracted from the white blood\ncells of these characters. This egg will be inserted into a foster mother where\nit will become an embryo and, after the\nusual nine months, there will be born an\nidentical twin of Harold Wilson, Feinberg\nor Monroe. The e nucleation of the\nfertilised eggs and the injection of the\nspecial nuclei will be done by Japanese\nexperts (because they are so pre-eminent\nat micro-manipulation), paid much more,\nof course, than our Prime Minister.\nIt is not difficult to realise that these\noperations will pose rather difficult\nquestions for the Commission. Do we\nreally want a thousand Feinbergs?\nPersonally I would prefer a few Cricks, troublesome as he sometimes is; and you\nmay not wish to have so many Harold\nWilsons around, and prefer some Chou en\nLa i's. Needless to say, the Monroe\nanalogues present different but, perhaps,\nmore interesting problems. That the\noperation can be done and, therefore,\naccording to AC Clarke, will be done,\nseems to me a certainty.\nTeaspoonfull of a poison, easily\nproduced by special germs, can kill\neveryone in London.\nI turn now to another aspect of biology\nin your lifetime: genetic engineering. Of\ncourse, you will soon have bacteria\n\" trained\" to produce currently expensive\nchemicals like insulin and prostaglandin\nquite cheaply. But there is potentially,\nan unpleasant side to genetic engineering\nand again, I fear, we drift into the\nmilitary or geopolitical sphere. It seems\ncertain that, again in your lifetime, genes\ncontrolling toxins such as those of\ncholera and bot u linus will be able to be\nput into the bacterium E, coli, a normal\ninhabitant of most human intestines.\nDeliberately or inadvertently, this could\ncause appalling trouble. A teaspoon ful.1\nof bot u linus toxin is enough to kill\neveryone in London. For comparison, a teaspoon full of cyanide, usually thought\nof as a very deadly poison, would only\nkill a bus load of people. Although some\npeople think the dangers associated with\ngenetic engineering are exaggerated, I am\nsure this subject should not and will not\nmerely be left to the good sense of us\nscientists, even though some nice things,\nto do with nitrogen fixation and food, and\nwith a nimo plants, will happen apart from\nthe malevolent possibilities to which II have referred.\nBroadly speaking then. you will have to\nbe satisfied, during your lifetime, with\nthe biological systems that evolution has\nhappened to produce on earth. From now\non, others will be possible, by human\nintervention: that is to say, evolution\nwill be by-passed or short-circuited.\nCutting out millions of years of trial and\nerror really'makes one think.\nPossibility of deep-freezing astronauts\nfor long journeys into outer space.\nI referred earlier to the idea, popular\namong fu t urologists and some scientists, that population pressures on earth can or\nwill be alleviated or solved by dispatch ing people to outer space. You can, I believe, forget about going far enough out\ninto space to have much chance of\nmeeting intelligent beings because the\nalmost inconceivable size of the universe\nand the velocity of light restrict the\nprobability of such a meeting to the\nneighbourhood of zero. As I am sure you\nknow, the Special Theory of Relativity\ndoes not preclude objects, tachyons for\nexample, travelling faster than light; but\nthen they cannot travel slower. Conversely,\nthings - us and our containers \u2014 which\ntravel slower than light, cannot ever\nThe difficulty is that even\nif one could deep-freeze a human being without killing\nhim or her, the warming-up\nprocess would almost certainly\nturn the subject into an idiot,\nbecause our brains do not\nrespond well to freezing and\nthawing.\ntravel faster. So the only way to get a reasonable but not excessive distance\nfrom earth, say a thousand light years or\nabout 6,000 tera miles( excuse me\nmentioning that the prefix tera means a million million or 10 to the power of 12),\nthe only way would be by deep-freezing\nthe explorers in their spaceship and\nwarming them up just before arrival by a delayed defrost command from within the\nspaceship (not, of course, from earth).\nThe inmates of the spaceship would,\nnaturally, be re-deep-frozen for the\nreturn journey. But there is a difficulty\nabout this idea, which in any case would\nmake no dent in our population problem.\nThe difficulty is that even if one could\ndeep-freeze a human being without killing\nhim or her, the warming-up process would\nalmost certainly turn the subject into an\nidiot, because our brains do not respond\nwell to freezing ft nd thawing.\nThis experiment may have been done\non hamsters. But it is not always easy to\ntell if a hamster is mentally deficient.\nThe idea of solving our population\nproblem with the help of outer space,\nin contradistinction to gratis ying man's desire to conquer the unknown, has\nbeen developed in considerable detail by\nThen, the numbers in terms >\nof energy expenditure, money\nand resources become\noutrageous, so incomprehensibly\nlarge as to baffle description,\nimagination or meaning.'\nthe enthusiastic and hopeful Profession\nG KO' Neill of Princeton University, who\nwants - and expects \u2014 rotating cylinders\ncontaining you , clouds, lakes, fish, ski slopes, electric cars, food and other\namenities, beyond the earth. He even\nhopes to make the operation pay.\nExciting as this concept is, the scientist, as the great Lord Rayleigh said, must\nget down to some quantitative work to\ntest ideas, hypotheses and observations.\nThe results are rather disheartening.\nSuppose we want to put a totally trivial\nnumber of people, 2,000, and their\nrotating cylinders into outer space. It\nwon't help solve the population explosion,\nbut some may think it the beginning of\nNo little green men discovered in\nouter space.\nsomething bigger, better and more\nuseful . The energy needed to get the\ncylinders and their 2,000 inmates into\nthe best orbit in space is some 15,000\nterajoules. It is hard to visualise so\nlarge an amount of energy. It is equivalent\nto half a million tons of TNT and, if one\nassumes that the rocket propellant is\nmade of the most efficient mixture of\nhydrogen and oxygen, the cost of the fuel\nalone for these 2,000 man-cylinders will be considerably more than our whole\nGross National Product in 1974, a much\nhigher figure than that of Professor\nO'Ne ill. But all this is peanuts. Suppose\nwe want to make an equally trivial, but\nsomewhat bigger dent in the world\npopulation problem, say five million people into outer space instead of two\nthousand, though five million is still insignificant, 0 . 1 % of the world's population. Then, the numbers in terms\nof energy expenditure, money and\nresources become outrageous, so\nincomprehensibly large as to baffle\ndescription, imagination or meaning.\nBut have you not forgotten that elixir of life, that philosophers' stone, fusion\nenergy released by the conversion of\ndeuterium to helium? No, even then, in\nspite of the miracles fusion power will achieve, the answer will be the same \u2014\nno soap, if only because energy is but\npart of the effort needed. Goodbye, then,\nouter space to solve our headaches.\nBack to the barely, heard-of Calhoun?\nWho will say? Someone had better.\nThat ball filled with human beings\nthat I mentioned earlier is no joke.\n\n"

The most obvious example of this was Japan, which seemed to be producing a technological heritage over the\ndecades since1945 equal to and greater than ours of 200 years.\nDetermined to do something\nabout this sorry state of affairs,\nthey decided to send somebody\nout to Japan to see How They\nDid It. Kindly, and for no\nparticular reason. The Goldsmiths' Institute agreed\nto finance this expedition. The man they sent (this reads like\nJames Bond, doesn't It?) was Dr GC Sneed, an engineer\nworking in the Science\nMuseum, who lectured to us this evening.\nThis Intrepid traveller\nspent a couple of months in\nJapan, going round the various\ntypes of schools and universities, asking thousands of questions\n(through a translator) and\ntaking 2000 photographs. He\ncovered every facet of Japanese\nlife, trying to explain why\nJapan had so many competent\nengineers. Firstly he looked\nat the various primary and\nsecondary schools. Perhaps\nsuperb science facilities encouraged wo u Id-be engi ne ers? Not a chance. Standard lab. facilities were chairs, tables\nand blackboards. Possibly, there might be a balance\nsomewhere, or some test tubes,\nbut the students much prefer ed lapping up theory. But why?\nIn Japan, there are two\ntypes of university, state\nowned and privately owned.\nThese privately owned\nestablishments are second\ngrade places that are run as businesses, and do not figure\nin the Great Technology Drives. The state universities take the\ncream, and after the four year\ncourse, the selection procedure\nis very simple: The best\npeople go to the best firms.\nNone of this democracy of\ninterviewing everybody who\nwants to be. This appears to\nbe the root cause. Because it\nis obvious who the best people\nare, and because these are so well-paid, it is a matter of\nprestige of who can make the\ngrade to become one of the elite, who own the second homes, the\nbig cars and the big yachts.\nSo everyone is struggling to\nmake it themselves, or egging\ntheir children on to become one\nor marry one. It's simple\nDigging up Jerusalem\nThe meeting on 3rd November was rather a special occasion, being the first time\nthat a woman had delivered a talk to the society. Dame\nKathleen Kenyon, arche logi st of great repute, spoke on\n\"Digging up Jerusalem\" - a task which she undertook in\nthe sixties. Ancient Palestine had always been somewhat\novershadowed both politically and artistically by neighbours\nlike Egypt and has thus\nreceived relatively little\nattention from archeologists.\nThose who have studied it\nhave been rewarded not so much by splendid finds \u2014 the\nbest articles that Dame\nKathleen found being a pair\nof battered bronze buckets \u2014\nas by the satisfaction of\nfilling a gap in human\nknowledge.\nLittle remains of the early\ncities that stood on the site\nand thus the talk was largely\ndevoted to tracing the movements of their walls from the\neconomics. In Japan, engineering is fashionable, and no\nlonger do some of the best\nbrains do arts subjects and go\nstraight into the civil service.\nIt doesn't pay so well. So the British Government\nnow knows what to do. Well,\nMr Healey, How about cut t ting engineers' income tax, for\nstarters...?\nAlan Lodge\nreign of David, through those\nof Solomon and Herold, up to\nthe obliteration of the city by\nthe Romans in AD70, following the first revolt of the\nJews. It is indeed fortunate\nthat the walls did more for the\npresent cry, which reappeared\nwhen Christianity became\nacceptable, is now so crowded as to prevent their\nexcavation.\nIn all, it was a very\ninteresting talk by a great\nauthority on the subject.\nRC Pettit\nCHESS CLUB In response to\npopular demand, the\nchess club is organising\na club night, every\nMonday, from 7.00pm to 10.30pm, starting on\nMonday, 27th October.\nAll interested are\nwelcome.\nHORSE-RIDING\nInterested contact Adam\nRawicz-Szezerbo\nEle c EngI.

Much\nto everyones surprise this\nworked, with IC blocking the\nmidfield, not allowing the UCH forwards any space. IC's first\ngoal, though slightly lucky,\nwas deserved, the ball\nrebounding off the post only to\nbe put in by their goal keeper.\nLifted by the goal IC continued\nto. put pressure on the UCH defence and five minutes\nbefore half time scored the\nbest goal of the game. From a break down the right wing, the\ncentre was neatly flicked into\nthe goal by Trev Tutu.Leading\nby two goals at half time,\neverything seemed to be\nworking fine and for fifteen\nminutes after the break IC\ncontinued as before; However\n;-3lightly casual play in defence by IC and good anticipation by\naUCH forward resulted in UCH pulling a goal back. Pressure\nwas applied to the IC defence\nfor a considerable period which\nincluded several short corners\nand one of which was well saved with a neat leg glance\nby Jim Marshall. Towards the\nend of the game IC got back on\ntop but no more goals were\nforthcoming.\nThis was a good performance\nwith the whole team playing\nwell, especially Jasper Cooke,\nAllen Brown, Mike Isles and\nTrev Tutu. Team: Charles Brown, Kim\nHoulden, James Marshall,\nJasperfBites your legs) Cooke,\nIvan (The terrible) Hodgson,\nAllen (gum shield Brown,\nA lister Ross, John (missed it\nagain) Latter, Michael Is'es,\nJuliet (we're going to get\nthrashed) Andrews, Trevor\n(pass it to me) Tutu.\nMIXED HOCKEY Imperial College 2\nRoyal College of Pharmacy 2\nAs everyone turned up on\ntime, tor once, the mixed\nteam arrived at Pharmacy an\nhour early, so there was a lengthy warm-up before the\ngame. When it eventually\nstarted, it turned out to be\nan excellent match. . The\nfirst half yielded a goal for\neach side, Chas Hardy\nscoring from a short corner\nfor IC. In the sec q nd half,\nthe game swung from end to\nend, with IC managing to\ngrab the lead, but only for a short while, Pharmacy\nquickly replying with what\nwas the goal of the match.\nU.L.6 a side Hockey Venue:- Motspur Park Imperial College lis\nDespite, or because of, the\ndeparture of the IC captain\nand 1st Team early on in the\nproceedings, the IC 2nd's proceeded convincingly to win\nits first two matches, Chas Hardy scoring most of the\ngoals. Due to a\"s light\" lack\nof fitness (and the missing of\nan open goal by C BH) we only\nwon the quarter-final match on\ncorners. The semi-final proved\ntoo much for this gallant\nband and despite two goals\nfrom out of the blue to draw\nthe score line, we lost on\ncornets. The LSE won the\ntournament.\nTeam: CC Brown (capt),\nJ Andrews, KHoulden, A Ross,\nCB Hardy, D Balderson, J Huckle, NWoodgate and R Vaz.\nCOPY DATE Copy date for the next\nissue of FELIX is Monday\n10th November.\n2.00 pm.\nAll articles missing this\ndeadline will be zapped to\nsmithereens.\nImperial College 1st XI 0\nUniversity College 1st XI 0\nAs the score suggests this\nwas a disappointing game for\nboth sid as, nei ther team ga in i ng\nany superiority over the other.\nFrom our point of view, the\ngame was spoilt by the tackling methods employed by the UC defence. When on a number of\noccasions a forward broke\nthrough he was savagely\nbrought down from behind. The\nplay oscillated between both\nends with very few clear cut\nchances created, the defences\ncoming out on top. Both-John\nAndrews and A lister Ross had\ngood games in midfield,\nespecially John who has done\na great job playing out of\nposition. This was a gritty\nperformance from a team which\nis finding it difficult to settle\ndown, but shows considerable\npromise.\nTeam: Charlie Brown, Jim\nMarshall, Kim .Houlden, Ivan\nHodgson, Julie Andrews,\nAlister Ross, John Latter,\nMjke Isles, Trev Tutu, Bob\nMiddleton, Andy Brewster.\nImperial College 1st XI 1\nBorough Road College 1st XI 1\nHaving collected four\npoints from our first two\nleague matches the 1st XI\ntrau ched to Borough Road\nCollege on Saturday to try\nand make it six out of a possible six. However IC\nstarted slowly and BR C gained the advantage,\ndominating the midfield.\nAfter 10 minutes BR C were\nawarded a penalty stroke\nwhich they duly converted,\nCharlie Brown in goal being\npenalized for an illegal clearance. BR C continued to\napply pressure right through\nthe half, but dogged defence\nkept them out. After the\ninterval, the roles changed,\nIC for the first time applied\nconstant pressure, Trev Tutu,\nand Mike Isles looking\ndangerous at the front.\nA good move involving\nMike and Trev resulted in\nTrev being knocked down in\nthe ' D'( shooting area) and\nKim Houlden scored from the\npenalty flick. After this IC\npress uri sed the BR C defence\nbut were unable to break\nthrough due to good work by\ntheir goalkeeper.\nThis was an excellent\nhard working performance\nwith special credit due to\nAllen Brown, A lister Ross and\nKim Houlden.\nImperial College II XI Old Walcountonians\nTen IC stalwarts eventually arrived in the deep South to play\na bunch of cowboys and ex-convicts from Surrey. Right from the\nstart IC realised they were up against a team possessing all the\nqualities that made Nazi Germany great, and at half-time the\nscore stood at 2\u20140 to the home side . In the second half IC\nbuilt up pressure and all four forwards came close to scoring a number of times before Balderson netted from five centimetres.\nThere was no further score although, in goal, Carlile made\na fine save with his left ear-lobe in the dying seconds.\nSPORTING MOTORCYCLE CLUB Sunday, 26th October saw\nthe annual run of the Club to\nthe 'Evening News Race Of\nThe South at Brands Hatch'.\nThe weather was kind and so\nwas luck, only one or two\nmembers' go lost! We all arrived in time for the first\nrace, scheduled for 12.30pm. The racing was close and\nexciting and provided good\nvalue for money. The first\nsuperbike race was won by\nBarry Ditchburn on the Works\nKawasaki (of course)-by a mile.

    "content": "FilIX 3\nThe Future\nThe following is the major text of the speech delivered by Lord\nRothschild, on the occasion of becoming an Honorary Fellow and\nSpecial Visitor of the Imperial College of Science and Technology.\nTHE MOST important members of this\naudience have only recently started\ntheir adult lives and may therefore\nwonder what the future holds in store\nfor them. So, like many others before. I thought I would have a shot at telling\nyou. I start with the difficulty that,\nthough I am pretty confident you will live longer than your fathers and mothers,\nI don't know how long longer is. But this\nhas the advantage for me of not having to\nbe too precise about dates \u2014 perhaps in\nsome cases Is hall be out by a mere\nmatter of a thousand years or more.\nTrying or pretending to foretell the\nfuture has been a human failing since the\nearliest times. But fu t urologist have not\nalways been too successful when peering\ninto the crystal ball. In1925, for example,\nBertrand Russel I pronounced that \" physical science is thus approaching the stage\nwhen it will be complete and therefore\nuninteresting.\" It would be a long job to\nlist the advances in physical science\nsince then. JB S Haldane, one of England' s brightest and most eccentric scientists, wrote that he was satisfied from thermodynamic calculations that the energy\ninside an atom could never be harnessed.\nSimilarly, Rutherford did not believe that\natom-splitting would ever be put to\npractical use (or misuse for that matter).\nSo much for prophecies about nuclear\npower and the H bomb which, incidentally,\nI predict will not intentionally be used\nin your lifetime, though there will be\nsome troublesome moments. These\nexamples are sufficient to explain why I approach my task with modesty and an\nappropriate lack of confidence.\nColonization of outer space will not\nsolve world population explosion.\nMany people, like Malthus in 1798, are\nworried about the population explosion\nand, unless the American scientist Calhoun' sex peri emts on the reluctance\nof rats to reproduce at the expected rate,\neven when not crowded, have been\nconfirmed and can be extrapolated to\nhuman beings, there are good reasons for\nthis worry. If we assume, only, of course,\nfor purposes of illustration, that people\nwill go on having babies at the present\nrate, by the year, 3.700 the weight of all the human beings on earth will equal the\nweight of the earth. Some 1.700 years\nlater, in the year 5.400, if everyone on\nearth were to be put into a hollow ball, its radius would have to be 20.000 times\nthat of the earth and the ball would have\nto expand at an alarming rate to keep up\nwith the constantly increasing number of\nbabies.\nSome solution of the population\nexplosion is, evidently, necessary; and\nthe need for a solution is one of the\nreasons why writers about the future and\nothers like the distinguished scientist, JD Bernal, predict an exodus from earth\nto other parts of the universe.\nIt surprises me that so many writers\nabout the future seem mes meri sed by\nouter space and by Professor Wheeler of\nthe Institute for Advanced Studies at\nPrinceton, in part of whose universe\ntime does not exist, with all sorts of\nImprobable and, in my view, impossible\nconsequences. But nearly all of these\nwriters, in spite, probably, of having\nheard of Crick, Watson, DNA and RNA, fail to realise the equally or more fantastic\nchanges taking place now in the Life\nSciences and, with certainty, in the\nfuture during your lifetime. Although I shall have something to say about outer\nspace I shall also dilate a little on what\nyou can expect in and from the living\nworld.\nOne can Implant electrodes into a particular part of a rat's brain and, by\nelectrical stimulation, induce the\nexperience of intense pleasure. The rats\ncan be t aug hi to switch the electricity on\nwhen they feel like it, and it turns out\nthat the pleasure is so intense that when\nthe rats are presented with their equivalent\nof caviare or Marilyn Monroe, they ignore\nthese stimuli and continue to press the\npleasure button. There seems little\ndoubt \u2014 and I think it has been confirmed\nexperimentally - that the same can be\ndone with human beings. In your lifetime\nthe crude method of electrical stimulation,\nwhich in any case would be inapplicable\non a large scale, will be replaced by its\nchemical equivalent, in the form of a pill, Ext as in( a descendant Aldous Huxley' s Soma). I don't know what the chemical\nwill be but I suspect it will be something\nlike cate chola mine( familiar to nerve\nphysiologists and some others) but more\ncomplicated and therefore difficult to\nmanufacture illicitly. Anxiety about top civil servants\nbecoming too good humour ed and euphoric under the influence of\nExtasin\nWhat may some of the consequences of\nExt as in be? For reasons of economy and\nmodernity, special issues of Ext as in will replace the honours doled out to Civil servants and some others on the Queen's birthday and at other times of the year.\nSome naive people might think that the\nnumber of days' pleasure will be proportional to the level of the honour; one\nday for an M, two for an O, three for aC, four for aK and five for aG. But that\nwill not be the case. We cannot afford to\ngive our most senior and distinguished\ncivil servants four or five days of\nuni mitigated ecstasy, because v of the\nawesome problems they have to face\neach day and which, in their ecstatic\ncondition, they might not take seriously\nenough. Imagine the Secretary of the\nCabinet or the Permanent Head of the\nTreasury having an overwhelming and,\npossibly, euphoric sense of satisfaction\nthroughout one week. The concept is\nuntenable \u2014 inconceivable \u2014 so the\nquantitative aspects of this new form of\nhonour will require the attention of an\nInterdepartmental Committee or even,\nperhaps, a Royal Commission. Shortly after the introduction of\nExt as in for this purpose, it will be issued\nfree, to a strictly limited extent, on the\nHealth Service, every Saturday morning.\nCancellation of Saturday Extasin\nration replaces prison sentences.\nThe Law Court computers may decide,\nnot only for public expenditure reasons,\nthat cancellation of Ext as in should\nreplace the present archaic system of\nprison sentences. If one is used to\nintense pleasure every weekend, it will By the year 3,700 the weight\nof all the human beings on\nearth will equal the weight of\nthe earth. The need for a solution of the population\nexplosion is one of the reasons\nwhy writers about the future\npredict an exodus from earth\nto other parts of the universe.\nBut how would we get there and\nis it possible? Or do we go\nback to the barely heard-of\nCalhoun? Lord Rothschild\ntakes a look at the problem\nof over-population.\nbean intense punishment not to experience\nit, quite apart from withdrawal symptoms.\nOr will the computers come to the\nopposite conclusion and quintuple the\nHealth Service dose, on the basis that\npeople in a permanent good humour and in\na condition of intense pleasure will neither steal, rape nor mug again? Only\nthe computers will tell. There is also the possibility, though\nit is not a probability as in the case of\nExt as in, that intense misery pills, called \u2022 Miserin, will be developed and replace\nprison sentences.\nUsed in war; or is Extasin better?\nI am sure that one or both of these\nsubstances will be produced in your\nlifetime and not only will they be used\nfor the purposes already mentioned, but\nalso in war, or the threat of it. What does\na commander do when his troops, pilots,\nastronauts or sailors become depressed,\ndejected and apathetic following a surprise dispersal of Miserin originating\nfrom a satellite? What might well happen\nhere in these circumstances is that gas\nmasks, though in existence, will either\nbe in the wrong place or the rubber will have perished. Some Frenchman, perhaps\nTalleyrand, said,\" War is much too\nserious a thing to be left to military\nmen\". In your time war may well have to\nbe left to the anti-chemists. So it will be\na race between the dejection and anti -dejection chemists, just as it is today\nbetween the SAM' s with their changing\ngadgetry and the electronic counter measures in the aircraft or ICBM' s to be\nshot down.\nThe alternative scenario, just as\ndifficult for'the generals to cope with, is\nfor all the troops to be in such a good\nhumour that they can't be bothered to deal\nwith the enemy.\nSo,as is often the case, this particular\npeek into the future has civil and\nmilitary connotations.\nOne thousand identical twins of\nHarold Wilson and 1975 Equivalent\nof Marilyn Monroe.\nBut the next peek does not \u2014 it is\nwholly desirable and benevolent. It\nconcerns clones, identical individuals. Within your lifetime it seems certain that\nwe shall be able to produce as many\ncompletely identical human beings as we\nwish. The problem for the World Commission on Genetical Control, which will shortly be created for this if not other\nreasons, is: who does the Commission\nwant? Is it a thousand Harold Wilsons, a thousand Feinbergs or a thousand 1975 analogues of Marilyn\nMonroe \u2014I leave the precise specification\nin this last case to your own i dio sync rac Continued on page 4\n\n"

The friendly epitome of\nunflappable diplomacy, he possesses a finely honed razor of a mind, a disarming fluency of ideas and perhaps the driest\nsense of humour in IC. He arrived here in 1962 when there were\naround 2,700 students studying (there are now over 4,000)\nand just as the Southside halls were being finished, having\ncompleted an astonishingly impressive career in HM'Government's Colonial( later called Overseas) Service in what was then\nTanganyika.\nBorn at Cape Town, South\nAfrica of British parents in\n1918, Mickey was educated\nthere and studied for one\nyear at Cape Town University\nbefore winning a Rhodes\nscholarship to Oxford where\nhe spent the next two years.\nIt was during this period, he\nrecalls wistfully, that he was\ncapped twice for Wales at\nRugby Union and yet did not\nget a 'blue' for the sport \u2014\n\" an unusual but not unique\nexperience. I was very good\nfriends with the captain of\nthe Oxford team that year\nwhich makes it all the more\ninteresting.\" His eyes twinkle\nmischievously and his wry\nsmile seems to echo the\nsentiment.\nFresh down from Oxford In\n1940, he entered the Colonial Service as an Administrative\nOfficer and was sent to\nTanganyika which was then\nunder British Trusteeship.\nAfter various jobs in the\nfield, two years second ment to the Colonial Office here in\nLondon (\"What they used to\ncall' beach combing'\" he\nsmiled), and three-and-a half\nyears as private secretary to\nthe Governor of Tangonyika,\nhe event u a I ly rose to ministerial\noffice in the colonial government of the day, initially In\nthe Ministry of Security and\nImmigration, being responsible\nfor the police, the prison\nservice and defence during\nan unsettled period in Africa' s history when the growing\nfeeling of nationalism was\nprevalent. \"It was the first\nfaltering steps towards the\ncountry's independence and\nwe had a ministerial form of\ngovernment as opposed to a civil service kind.\"\" These were not easy\ntimes with African nationalism\non the march. One was doing\na job which was in effect to\ndo oneself out of a job. This did cause problems for some,\nbut I personally found it\neasier because I believed in\nwhat the ultimate goal for\nTanganyika was: independence.\nI went out there with a lot of\nidealism and I do not think I ever lost any. \"I got to know\nvery well Julius Nyerere, who\nis now the President of\nTanzania and who was\nTanganyika's first Prime\nMinister, when he was the\nleader of the Tanganyika African National Union. Later we were\ncolleagues in the Council of\nMinisters under the Governors\nso I had the unusual experience\nof knowing Julius Nyerere on\n'both sides of the fence as it\nwere.\" It was in 1960 when the\ngovernor's right-hand man, the\nChief Secretary, was away for\nfour months between May and\nAugust that Mickey as the then\nMinister for Information was\nappointed Acting Chief\nSecretary. The transfer of\npower in the neighboring\nBelgian Congo was not going\npeacefully during this period\nand thousands of Belgian\nnationals were fleeing across\nLake Tanganyika to Tanganyika\nitself to seek refuge. It fell\nupon the Acting Chief Secretary\nto organise the reception of\nthousands of refugees and this\nwas done by building camps\nat utmost speed. For this he\nwas awarded the Media lie de\nla Belgique Reconnaissante\nby the Belgian government on\nhis return to Britain the\nfollowing year.\nReturning to London In\nApril 1962 having completed\ntwenty-one years in the\nColonial Service, Mickey\napplied for the vacant job of\nSecretary of the Imperial\nCollege.\" I was interviewed\nby a panel which included Sir\nPatrick Linstead who was\nthen Rector of the College.\" He got the job.\nA major preoccupation at\nthe time was the College's redevelopment building program. It was IC's essentially 'bricks and mortar' period\nwith Sir Patrick Linstead as\nthe main driving force. The\nSouthside halls were just\nbeing completed, the old\nCity and Guilds building was\nbeing pulled down, the\nSherfield Building was only\nin the pipeline and Queen's Tower was precariously\nswaying in the w ind.\nIt was almost bizarre that\nthe end of this period happened\nto coincide with the Rector's death. Sir Patrick Linstead\nwas succeeded by atomic\nscientist Lord Penny in\n1967.\n\" Lord Penney's arrival\nhere coincided with a general\nawakening of interest on the\npart of the NUS and student\nunions generally. It was\nfrom that time forward that\nstudents here took a greater\ninterest in College committees;\nstudent observers came onto\nthe Governing Body during\nthat time. Throughout the\nhistory of Imperial College,\neach Rector has made his\nown distinctive contribution\nto the College.\" Hmm, I thought. .Time for a speculative probe I think. Do\nyou think that Sir Brian F lowers'\ntime as Rector will be\nremembered as one during which\nImperial College began to\nthink about Europe? The\naplomb faltered not one iota.\nThe finely honed razor parried\nthe thrust elegantly. \" I'm not\nreally able to read the tea-leaves on this one. I don't think I would say more than\nthat his time as Rector will be regarded as significant.\" Hmm, I thought. Time to\ngive up.
