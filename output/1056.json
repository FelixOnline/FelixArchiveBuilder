    "content": "TWO . FELIX FRIDAY MAY 10TH1996 NEWS\nNews\nin brief\nCampus-wide theft spree\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nThe May Bank Holiday weekend\nproved to be a hit of break to\nsome enterprising young thief as\nLinstead Hall residents woke on\nMonday morning to discover that\nseveral of their games machines\nand a telephone had been looted.\nThere were no signs of a forced\nentry to the building and the\nburglary has highlighted concerns\nabout security in Halls.\nThe thefts, reported on\nMonday, are believed to have\noccurred in the early morning,\nshortly after a routine security\npatrol had toured the building.\nThe thief removed glass from a pinball machine and broke open\nthe cash box on a pool table in\nthe bar as well as wrenching a payphone oil the wall in the\nLower Gallery, but it is not\nknown how much money was\nstolen from the equipment.\nKenneth Weir, Deputy Head of\nSecurity, noted that the amount\nof violence used was unusual, and\nprobably indicated that the thief\nwas \"inexperienced.\"\nHow the thief entered the\nhall is not known, and though the\nsecurity around the bar area has\nbeen recently stepped up it does\nnot seemed to have prevented\nthe games machines from being\nlooted, something that has\nhappened before.\nDr Lancaster, Warden of\nLinstead Hall, admitted that\nSecurity have \"a major task\nsecuring Princes Gardens\", and\nthat access to Linstead was relatively easy, though the Hall and\nSecurity were looking to prevent\nunauthorised access more effectively in the future, including a new set of locks for the doors and\nwindows of the bar.\nUntil a few years ago,\nLinstead Hall had its own security guard, but with the introduction of closed circuit television\nmonitoring, the guard was relocated to Southside. Dr Lancaster\nsuggested that though a return to\nthis situation might have an\neffect on the number of burglar-ies, the move would not be cost\neffective, as there have been too\nfew burglaries to justify the two\nstaff that would be needed to\ncover the Hall.\nMr Weir said that the\nresources that were available\nwere insufficient for more\nguards, and that electronic monitoring from the Security station\nat Southside was preferable.\nBY MARK BRIDGE\nThe Royal School of Mines was\nparticularly badly hit by\ncomputer thefts over the Easter\nperiod. Thieves managed to\nsteal a significant cache of\ncomponents from the departments of physics, geology and\nearth resources engineering and\nan administrative section of the\nHuxley building. By selectively\nremoving the components and\nreplacing the outer shells they\ndeferred detection until just\nbefore the start of term.\nThe thieves probably\ngained access to the building by\nfollowing students who legitimately swiped in. There were\nno signs of any break-ins, and\nthe first many knew of the\nproblem was when terminals\ncame up with memory error\nmessages.\nKen Weir, Deputy Chief of\nSecurity, has advised the various departments to effect\nspecific counter measures,\n\"Security could not have known\nand this is a serious breach\". He also suggested that if students\nand staff see someone not\nfamiliar to their department\nbehaving suspiciously they\nshould ask security to check\nthat they are there with good\nPHOTO: IVAN CHAN\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nBlythe spirit\nImperial College Governors are\nmeeting today to decide\nwhether to give the go ahead to\ndevelop a new arts centre on the\ntop floor of the planned new\nlibrary and bookstore complex.\nThe plans include a new\nauditorium and gallery as well as\nrehearsal rooms improved facilities for Imperial's choir and\norchestras. The project has been\nmade possible by the Blythe\nbequest, which was designed to\npromote music at Imperial, but\nit is unclear whether the fund\nhas sufficient capital to go ahead\nwith the plans in the near future.\nThe Blythe project group are\ndeveloping an application for\nNational Lottery arts funding,\nwhich may include cooperation\nwith the Albert Hall and local\nmuseums.\nGrand entrance\nSenior IC staff and\nDepartmental Heads are reporting back to the estates department over plans to redesign the\nfront entrance of the College.\nPotential plans include\nenclosing the Exhibition Road\nend of the walkway beside\nMechanical Engineering with a glass frontage and revolving\ndoor. There have also been\nsuggestions that the development may include a drop-in\ncentre for Imperial alumni.\nSue recovered\nSue Thornett, who works at\nPrinces Gardens Day Nursery, is\nback at work after being struck\nby a car while on the zebra crossing in front of the Science\nMuseum about two weeks ago.\nAfter X rays and several days off\nshe is now well, and just needs a follow up consultation. \"It\nwasn't that bad... no broken\nbones or anything\" said Sue,\nthanking the well wishers.\n\n"

Pb k':P 'film: hackers, .k The newest genre to emerge\nfrom Hollywood, the socalled 'cyber-thriller' which\nbases itself on the Internet\nhasn't( witness The Net, or Johnny\nMnemonic). Until now, thai\nis.\nHackers revolves\naround the new breed of\nyouth, those with super-competent computer skills,\nthe bane of all major companies. Jonny Lee\nMiller (Sick Boy in Trainspotting) plays Dade aka\nCrash Override aka Zero Cool, a computer\ngenius who caused the largest computer crash in\nWall Street history when he was only eleven and\nwas consequently banned from going near a computer until his eighteen birthday. Having just\nmoved to New York and turned eighteen, he has\nlost none of his skills and soon establishes himself\namongst the local hacker elite, Acid Bum, Cereal\nKiller, Lord Nikon, and The Phreak. When one\nof their number accidentally uncovers a plot to\nsteal millions they go up against The Plague, a master hacker who intends to cover his own\ntracks by framing them for the crime.\nBy fully embracing the technology, making it\nintegral to the plot rather than simply a plot\ndevice, Hackers is able to escape the trap that\nprevious films have fallen into. Rather than\nassuming that all the techno-babble and hardware would frighten off much of his audience,\nthe director Iain Softley has adapted it to\nbecome accessible to everyone, using swish\ngraphical effects to represent what is going on.\nThis is a very fast-paced and stylish movie;\nall the leads are street-smart and roller-blade\neverywhere. The script is sharp and funny; the\nantagonistic relationship between Crash\nOverride and Acid Bum (Angelina Jolie) is especially good, despite its predictability (Crash and\nBum, ged d it?). The weakest links are the NSA\nagents and Lorraine Bracco's corporate bimbo\naccomplice. Fisher Stevens makes a suitably\nslimy bad guy, and Miller is reasonably convincing as an eighteen-year old.\nHackers is a highly enjoyable, youthful film\nand the first of the new breed of thrillers worth\nwatching.\nvideo: circle of f ii ends s 'spooky\nSet in Ireland during the mid 1950's, Circle of\nFriends is a gentle revolving around Benny\n(Minnie Driver), a rather frump ish girl from a small village who falls for blue-eyed wonder boy\nJack (Chris O 'Donnell) at university in Dublin.\nThe heartaches are provided when one of her\nbest friends, Nan (Saffron Burrows), becomes\npregnant by the English 'Lord of the Manor'\n(Colin Firth).\nThere is nothing particularly remarkable\nabout this film, being neither bad nor especially\ngreat. The dominance of rural Irish-Catholicism,\nemphasising that sex outside marriage is a mortal sin, helps to give the coming-of-age tale a new\nangle, but the story as a whole moves fairly slowly and fails to captivate. In fact the sub-plots\ninvolving Benny's two friends Nan and Eve\n(Geraldine ORawes) are often more interesting\nthan the main story. Not that this has anything to\ndo with the lead, Minnie Driver in her film\ndebut, is more than competent carrying a lot of\nthe picture herself, it is more the fault of the\nscript. ,\nThis is a quiet, gentle little picture: it's unremarkable, but a lot better than much of the trash\nyou could see.\n-Video: neU ien ny ho\nJodie Foster is Nell, a woman who has spent all\nher life living a hermit-like existence in an isolated woodland cabin. When she is discovered by\ndoctor Ham Neeson with only her dead mother\nfor company, she is gibbering an incomprehensible language. Keen to prevent Nell from being\ninstitutional is ed for research purposes, Neeson\nand psychologist Natasha Richardson observe\nNell for three months in her own environment\nto help the courts decide what her future will be.\nAs they attempt to help Nell integrate into\nthe modem community, doctor and psychologist\nlearn to understand Nell's language and by doing\nso, they finally obtain her trust and friendship.\nWhere the film succeeds most is in portraying Nell's vulnerability as a potential victim of the\nmedia and the curious public, but the film\nrequires some suspension of disbelief. Nell\nseems surprisingly well-groomed and healthy\ndespite having lived in the wilderness for all her\nlife, and the courtroom scene where Nell makes\na speech while her doctor translates, is particularly unconvincing.\nAlready the winner of two Oscars for her\nroles in The Accused and Silence of the Lamb\nseems that Foster was trying her damnedest to\ngibber her way to a third. Some might find her performance irritating and a means of showing-off, but there's no denying that it is a fine and convincing one.\n\n"

CLAIR Dear Felix,\nI was very disappointed with\nyour editing of my chess report.\nWhy is it that everybody else\ngets twice as much space as us? I was not impressed with the way\nyou chopped the report in half,\nexplaining all the details of how\nthe competition worked, but\nthen not even giving our results.\nWhat is the point of explaining\nall the rules of the competition\nand then only writing one line to\nsay how we did? If there wasn't any room or something, we'd much rather have had a decent\nreport in the next Felix. Also I was hoping you might mention\nwhen we meet, which you didn't put in the article or the diary.\nAnyone who reads the article\nand wants to come to the club\nwon't know where we meet. It\nwould be nice if you could\ninclude us in your diary in future.\nWe meet on Wednesdays in the\nBrown Committee Room or\nClubs Committee Room at\n6.30pm. Dom Goodwin\nOn behalf of Felix, I'm sorry\nyou feel that you were treated\nunfairly, but there are also a few\npoints to clear up.\nIt's generally under s to ood that reports may be edited for\nlength; as it was printed, your\nwrite-up said who was on the\nteam, what the competition was\nand how well you did, which I'd regard as the relevant points.\nThe sports section size\ndepends on the number of\nreports submitted, so it would\nbe unfair on the other sports\nteams for us to set aside space\nfor 'old news' if we haven't been\nasked to do so.\nThe same applies to diary\nentries - you have to make your\nwishes known.

I 've worked\nout what's wrong.\nIt's not that Imperial's students are boring and ignorant -witness Bradshaw, Totty et al.\nand their rather alarming knowledge of Greek mythology and\nstained glass windows.\nIt's not that the College is\nrun by uncaring, anti-student\nproponents of officialdom - over\nthe past few months I have gradually come to the conclusion\nthat those who pull the strings\nhere are actually exceptionally\nenthusiastic and motivated.\nThat's just the point, you see: I think that as they plan and spend\ntheir way into a bigger and\nbrighter and shinier Imperial\nCollege of Science, Technology\nand Medicine, those they\nemploy sink into deeper and\ndeeper pits of dissatisfaction.\nI think IC must have a monopoly on poorly - motivated,\nsullen and intimidating staff.\nPeople whose very presence\noozes a feeling that they are thoroughly pissed off and don't want\nto be here. Catering staff that\nthrow your change at you as if to\nsuggest that you really don't deserve to be allowed to pay\nthrough the nose for a bland\nchicken tikka sandwich. Finance\ndepartment staff who throw\nyour grant cheque at you as\nthough the deed is the work of\nthe last of the great martyrs\nrather than part of their job\ndescription. Lecturers whose job\ndissatisfaction and frustration is\nmanifested into a disdain and\ndislike of students that makes\ngoing to ask for last week's lecture notes akin to a Labour of\nHercules. Security staff who,\nwhen tentatively roused from\nsleeping on the job because you,\nunreasonably enough, require\nsome security assistance, display\nthe care and compassion of\nVictor Meldrew.\nI don't if they're not paid\nenough, not challenged enough,\nor it we simply have a personnel\ndepartment that has rather a lot\nto learn. And before I get a post-bag full of in dig nance, I wouldn't begin to suggest that there aren't plenty of absolutely delightful\nsecurity staff, nor that the\nfinance department doesn't have\nit's fair share of charm. But so\nlong as the public face of this col-leg is permeated with a liberal\ndose of bored insolence we are\nnever going to get away from the\nfact that being at Imperial is a little bit embarrassing, and considerably depressing.\nEDITORIAL TEAM:\nNEWS: ALEX FEAKES FEATURES: MARK BAKER\nSUB-EDITING AND PROOFING: TIM ST CLAIR\nMUSIC: VIK BANSAL CINEMA: WEI LEE\nPHOTOGRAPHY: IVAN CHAN PUZZLES: CATFISH CLUBS AND SOCS: STEPHEN HAMILTON\nTHEATRE: KATHERINE FISHWICK AND CLAIRE SAMUEL\nARTS: JEREMY SCIENCE: BEN WILKINS\nCOLLATING LAST WEEK: MARK, BEN AND JEREMY\n\n"

How can you fail to be\nenchanted by this, the umpteenth Cocteau Twins\nalbum, with all its ethereal charm? It doesn't matter that the words are a hot ch pot ch;a dictionary\nthat has had alternate pages torn away to reveal a whole new vocabulary. Rather this than some forlorn attempt at a failed rhyming couplet (I have\nstill to understand quite what av Von der walT is,\napart from a crass attempt to avoid using the word\n'wonderful').\nAnyway, enough ofthe vitriol. As I said, there\nis no room for it here. This album comes as some\nsurprise, following much internal squabbling\nbetween Liz and one-time partner, Robin Guthrie\n- the man, along with the ffe qu end y under-rated\nSimon Raymonde, responsible for the intricacies\nadorning this particular cathedral. What did we\nexpect - something as venomous as The\nExploited perhaps? Maybe, for the cynics. But it's no use trying to preach to the un converted you\neither love the stuff or you find it as vile as Bonnie\nLangford in Just William. To me, this album\nshows the Cocteau's continuing maturity, adding\nmore and more delicate lyrics without ever\ndetracting from the fine song-smith e ry that the\ntrio obviously possess in abundance.\n\"So then, much more of the same,\" you say.\nWell, yes, to be per fec dy honest but would we\nreally have it any other way? I, for one, will be taking Elizabeth Fraser to bed with me again tonight\nand tomorrow night.\nWhispering sweet nothings? For me, more\nlike speaking in tongues.

His talent is again evident here with\ntracks such as 'Deep Karma Canyon' and\n'Egoveride' which have instant appeal and easily\nstand out above the rest.\nThe problems start when the tempo slows\nand the guitar effects are removed, leaving only an\nacoustic guitar with his, quite frankly, none-too-special vocals. A prime example of this is 'Hair\nStew', which is by far the worst track, and ends\nwith a particularly painful piece of feedback over\nsome badly sung, soul-destroying lyrics.\nMy main gripe is not the music, however,\nwhich is on the whole very good, but the cynicism\nwhich you find rising within you as each track\npasses. We all like to wallow in self-pity now and\nagain, and some would say that it is very good for\nthe psyche, but not all of us have a multi-million\ndollar music industry backing us up in order to\nallow us the outlet for this emotion. Making\nmoney from this makes me feel that Mould is\nlying. If this album is indeed just for him, why\neven release it? I'm sure that his record company\ndon't indulge their artists for love; the fact of the\nmatter is that fans will buy it and that the record\ncompany have saved a lot of time and money\nthrough lack of promotion.\nFrom the self-assessment chart on the insert\nto the lyrics, the whole affair stinks of self-in d ul gence rather than self-criticism. For being up his\nown rear end, Bob Mould gets a(0). For the musical content I have to give him a(7). "

    "content": "Initially the onset of memory loss is gradual and inconspicuous. Then sufferers start\nto forget-not only where they left their keys- but what their keys are for. Gradually,\nconfusion, loss of reason and language problems set in. In the final stages ofthe dis-ease, The Alzheimer's victims can't even recognise their own family. It is devastating\nand undignified condition with no cure. But new advances in imaging technology are\nhelping us to diagnose and understand Alzheimer's. Graham Eastwood reports.\n>in\nA round 600,000 people in the UK are estimated to suffer from\nAlzheimer's disease. It accounts for over three-quarters of\nBritish dementia cases in the over 65's but the disease can strike\nbefore the age of 30. It is the fourth largest cause of death, after heart dis-ease, cancer and stroke, in the western world. As you read this it may be\ntempting to dismiss the disease as a problem for the elderly-but as health\ncare standards continue to improve, and the population lives to an ever-increasing old age, it will become a major problem for our generation.\nFor scientists, Alzheimer's is very much a mystery disease. It is still\nnot clear what causes it. Although we do know the disease progresses by\ndestroying large numbers of nerve cells in the brain. Five areas are particularly susceptible (see figure)\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown that in\nthe brains of Alzheimer's patients, the death of\nnerve cells (which can be up to one-third of the\ntotal of the brain) causes the brain to si\nand the fluid-filled spaces around it\nincrease. The neurotransmitter a cet; choline (ACh), which is the major\nchemical messenger between the\nnerve cells in the brain's memory\ncircuits, is also depleted.\nAnother difficulty scientists\nhave faced is in the diagnosis of\nAlzheimer's. At present the\nonly way to diagnose the disease in living patients is by ruling out other possible causes of\nthe symptoms, such as\ntumours or strokes.\nAlzheimer's can be diagnosed accurately at death. At\npost-mortem, the brains of\nAlzheimer's patients contain\nabnormal bundles known as\nplaques and tangles. Plaques are\nformed by deposits of a fatty acid,\nknown as beta-amyl oid, wh i cf builds up in the nerve cells. Tangles\nform when the tau protein, which\nnormally maintains the health of\nnerve cells, clumps together inside the\ncells preventing them from working properly.\nEncouragingly however, in April of this year, a team led by David\nSmith and Kim Jobst from die Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford announced\nwhat is being hailed as a breakthrough in the detection of Alzheimer' s dis-ease. The new test uses, a combination of brain scanning and images of\nblood flow in the brain to pick out damaged areas. When brain cells are\ndamaged, the flow of blood to them is greatly reduced. A harmless\nradioactive dye called Ceretec is injected into a vein in the arm. The Dye\nquickly travels to the brain and sophisticated computer photographic\nequipment builds up an accurate 3D image of the damage to the brain\nWf\u00a7MpMff^ <-x which has been caused by the disease. It is said to be more than 90 per\ncent reliable. This opens the way for the early diagnosis of the illness and\nthe accurate selection of patients for future therapies and research pro-gram mes. Dr Jobst told The Guardian \"Until now there has been no\naccurate diagnostic test for Alzheimer's while the patient was alive. We\nthink we have made some exciting discoveries about brain function in\nAlzheimer's disease.\"\nIn other areas of research scientists have already identified a number\nof risk factors. Environmental risk factors could include\nhead injury, smoking and alcohol. In a puzzling\nseries of American studies, scientists con-ed that nicotine, which mimics the\n;uro transmitter ACh, may protect\nagainst Alzheimer's, drinking alcohol in moderation may have the\nsame effect. Strangely though,\nfW sJ W ki\"'\"\" \"Uk*\" Bk another study suggested that\nheavy drinking and smoking together may actually\nincrease the risk of developing the disease.\nHead injury may also\nincrease the risk. Some\nboxers, often seem to be\n'punch-drunk', and foot-ball er's( asked to head a400g ball travelling at\nk speeds of about 80\nmph), have shown\nsigns of brain\ndamage similar\nto that seen in\nAlzheimer's patients.\nScientists have also\nidentified three types\nof defective genes that if\ninherited could cause\nAlzheimer's although no clear evidence has emerged. A fourth gene,\nknown as the ApoE gene, has also been identified. It occurs in three different forms, named E2, E3, and E4. Everybody inherits two forms of the\ngene, one from each parent. A child that inherits two E4 forms of this\ngene will have a ten times greater chance of developing Alzheimer's dis-ease. There is a blood test available that can detect this combination, but\nshould this test be carried out ? Given that there is no cure for\nAlzheimer's, and that patients with this combination do not\n_\u2022 necessarily develop Alzheimer's, should a patient be told that\n\\ M. they may have a ten times greater risk ?\n\n"

FELIX FRIDAY MAY 1 OTH 1 9 9 6 SPORT\nFELIX SPORT\nIC Athletics Clubs Committee is\nsponsored by\nLAYERS\nLinstead footballers win tournament\nBY MARTIN ARCHIBOLD\nAt the end of last term the eleven\nmost elite hall teams met head to\nhead in the most prestigious\nevent in the inter-hall football\ncalendar. The Competition played at Harlington was the first\nof its kind.\nOpening rounds saw surprisingly early exits for Falmouth\nKeogh and Garden halls. In the\nsemi-finals unlucky Tizard suffered at the hands ol 'boring bor-ing' Clay ponds(10), whilst\nSouthwell were overwhelmed by\nthe relentless attacking style\ncharacteristic of Linstead Hall. The final predictably saw\nsome determined play from both\nsides, Linstead defence held\nClay ponds uncompromisingly, with some unrelentingly savage\ntackling, notably by David\nChattenee and Ming Chan.\nThe Clayponds eleven-man\ndefence held solid in the first half\ndespite some sparkling work\ndown the centre by Linstead's resident superstar Amo.\nIn the second, period there\nwas more of the same, our under-strength attacking talent sprightly\nbrushing aside the Clayponds\nold-timers.\nWith ten minutes left on the\nclock, a Linstead forward eventually penetrated the Clayponds\nrear guard,a dashing run by Amo\nfollowed by a lovely controlled\npass left Shane with a clear sight\nof goal. Unsurprisingly his superb\nright shin shot found the net.\nClayponds finally decided to\nplay some football. Alas, despite\nsome ludicrous penalty claims,\nthey never really troubled the\nbetter, and basically harder side.\nThe game ended one-nil to\nus, the terraces went crazy with\nboth pleasure and pain, and the\nentire population of Linstead\nwent to Southside bar to brag\nabout it.\nSpecial thanks to all the\nteam captains and Nic Roland in\nparticular for a very well organised com pet ion.

    "content": "Many students will already\nbe looking for accommodation for the next academic\nyear. Every year, many find\nthemselves experiencing\nhousing related problems.\nOften, there is little that can\nbe done to avoid this but\nsometimes better preparation and information can\nhelp to avoid or at least to\ndeal with some situations\nmore effectively.\nImportant First\nQuestions\nWhen you find a potential\nproperty, by asking yourself\nsome obvious yet crucial\nquestions you can save yourself a lot of trouble later on.\nSuch as;\n1. Can I afford the rent?\n2. Do I want to live in this\narea? Will I feel secure travelling to and from it at night?\n3. How much are my travel\ncosts going to be?\n4. If sharing with others- am\nI confident that I will get\nalong with my co-tenants-and are they sure that they\nwill not want to move out\nearly?\n5. Who is responsible for\npaying the bills and council\ntax? (If all tenants are students then you should apply\nfor exemption from Council\nTax from your local author i ty).\n6. What do I know about the\nlandlord? Can I speak to\nsome previous tenants to see\nif there have been any problems?7. Will I be a tenant or a licensee? (A licensee has\nfewer legal rights than a tenant and can sometimes be\nevicted without a court\norder).\nLicensee or Tenant ?\nYou may be a licensee if, for\nexample;\na). You will be living in the\nsame property as your landlord and sharing some\naccommodation (such as a bathroom or kitchen)\nb). You are living in a shared\nhouse but....\nc) Each resident has a separate tenancy agreement.\nd) The landlord is responsible for replacing tenants\nwho leave.\ne) The landlord reserves the\nright swap people around\ninto different rooms (in other\nwords you have not been\ngranted \"exclusive posses-sion\" of any room)\nIt can be quite complicated\nto ascertain your housing\nstatus in the event of a dispute (for example, if your\nlandlord is trying to get you\nto leave.)\nEven if you are a licensee, it\ndoes not necessarily mean\nthat you will face diff i cul ties. However, it will make\nit all the more important that\nyou consider point 6 above.\nAnother word of warning,\ndo not rely on \"testimonials\"\nor written statements which\npurport to be written by ex-tenants. Try to contact ex-tenants directly if you can.\nIf they still live there, do this\nwhen the landlord is not\naround to ensure that you are\ngetting an honest evaluation.\nContracts\nand before you sign the contract\n8. Have I read the it through\nthoroughly?\nIf there is anything you are\nunsure about, you should get\nit checked. Remember that\nyou are signing a legally\nbinding document. If there\nis something in it which you\ndo not like or which seems\nunreasonable, you should try\nto change it now. If there is\na written clause which causes you some concern and\nthe landlord assures you it\nwill not be applied, the only\nway to be sure of this is to\nchange it before you sign.\nVerbal contracts can be difficult to enforce.\n9. Am I signing a fixed term\ntenancy (i.e.a contract for a specified length of time)? If\nso, am I allowed, by virtue\nof an express \"break clause\"\nto move out before the fixed\nterm by giving a certain\nlength of notice or am I legally liable for the entire\nperiod? Usually, there will\nnot be a break clause and\nyou will be bound by the\nagreement for the fixed\nterm.\n10. Is there an inventory of\nfurnishings and fittings?\n(This is important as your\nlandlord might wrongly\nclaim that you have damaged or lost items when you\nhave not and this could lead\nto deductions from your\ndeposit when you move out).\n11. Am I happy with the\ncondition of the property? It\nis sometimes much better to\nget faults and damage remedied before you move in.\n12. Do I have to pay a deposit? Will I be given a clear receipt for this and a written assurance that it is\nreturnable (less deductions\nfor breakage's, damages,\ncleaning or whatever)?\nJoint Tenancies\nAlso, a few points to note on\nJoint tenancies\n1. Joint tenants are equally\nliable for all the rent on a property. Therefore if one\ntenant refuses to pay his/her\nrent, the others would have\nto make it up or risk facing\nan action for possession by\nthe landlord.\n2. The easiest thing to do if\none joint tenant moves out\nduring the fixed term is to\nseek the landlords permission to replace him/her. If\nthe tenancy is an assured\nshort hold, then the original\ntenancy is still in force\nunless the landlord agrees to\nissue a new agreement to\ninclude the new tenant.\nUnless this is done, the new\ntenant is effectively a sub-tenant of those named on the\nagreement and technically,\nthe person who moved out\ncould still be pursued for any\nrent owed.\nMost students experience\nfew problems while living in\nprivate accommodation but\nsome do get into difficulties.\nAs ever, careful thought and\npreparation before entering\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX FRIDAY MAY 1 OTH 1 9 9 6 . THREE\nBill triumphs in European Court\n\u201e .' . ._ u iii iii iii in ......\nBill Goodwin: Felix Editor 1988-89, ground-breaking lobbyist for\nthe freedom of the Press 1989-96.\nBY THE NEWS TEAM Bill Goodwin, an IC graduate and\nformer Felix editor, has won a year-long case against the British\nGovernment, which he claimed\nwas violating his human rights.\nThe dispute began after Bill,\nwho was working for the trade\npaper The Engineer, received\nconfidential information about a computer company, Tetra Ltd.\nAn informant, who wished to\nremain anonymous, described the\ncompany's financial problems.\nAfter attempting to contact one\nof the company's senior executives regarding the matter, Tetra\nclaimed that the information had\nbeen stolen from its offices, and\nthat its release could threaten the\ncompany's survival. In November\n1989 Tetra put pressure on Bill\nto reveal the identity of his\nsource, winning a High Court\nbattle. He refused to comply and\nwas fined \u00a35,000 for contempt of\ncourt. His case was also\ndismissed by the Court of Appeal\nand the House of Lords. At the\ntime he told Felix that he only\nevaded a jail sentence \"because of\nthe publicity\".\nIn June 1994 The European\nCommission for Human Rights\nreferred the case to the European\nCourt claiming that the British\nGovernment had violated the\njournalist's rights {Felix 1001).\nThey said that \"protection of the\nsources from which journalists\nderive information is an essential\nmeans of enabling the press to\nperform its important function of\n'public watchdog' in a democratic\nsociety.\" They were unconvinced\nthat the publicity had caused\nTetra undue harm and that there\nwas any justification in\ncompelling Bill to reveal his\nsource, given that the matter did\nnot affect national security.\nBacked by the National\nUnion of Journalists, what was\nseen as a test case appeared\nbefore the European Court of\nHuman Rights in April 1995\n{Felix 1026), with Bill's lawyers\narguing that English Law violated\nthe European Human Rights\nConvention by threatening journalists with fines and imprisonment if they wished to maintain\nthe anonymity of their sources.\nAt the end of March judgement was given, ruling that Bill\nwas not entitled to com pens a tion, though the court agreed his\nrights had been violated. They\nfurther ruled that the British\nGovernment should pay his costs\nof nearly \u00a337,600.\nGeoffrey Robertson QC, who had been representing Bill,\nsaid that this was a \"landmark\njudgement for press freedom,\"\nadding that the UK' s1981 Contempt of Court Act would\nhave to be amended. He also felt\nthat this would pave the way for\njournalists to claim compensation\nagainst the Government for\n\"mental anguish suffered by\nbeing threatened with imprisonment for obeying their\nconsciences.\" Bill commented\nthat the outcome \"was great\nnews for me and for journalists in\ngeneral.\"\nGovernment gives IC the Natural Resources Institute\nBY ANDREW SMITH\nIn the latest attempt to privat is e ancillary Government activities,\nBaroness Chalker has announced\nthat Imperial College is to be part\nowner of a former Foreign Office\ninstitute. Together with three\nother British Universities,\nImperial will oversee the allocation of the Natural Resources\nInstitute's \u00a325 million research\nbudget.\nSpeaking to Felix, Professor\nJohn Archer, Imperial College's Deputy Rector and newly\nappointed Vice Chancellor of\nHerriot Watt University,\nwelcomed the college's successful bid saying that he was\n\"delighted it has turned out so\nwell for us.\" Imperial College will\nbe responsible for the allocation\nof the research money, appointing two directors to a new\ncompany, but will otherwise have\nno financial outlay.\nThe Natural Resources\nInstitute (NRI) is currently\nadministered by the Overseas\nDevelopment Authority (ODA),\nitself part of the Foreign and\nCommonwealth Office. The\nGovernment scheme, in implementing a proposal by the\nUniversities of Greenwich and\nEdinburgh, and Imperial and\nWye Colleges, sees the current\nestablishment being separated\ninto two distinct sections.\nThe first section will control\nthe NRI's360 staff and premises\nat Chatham Maritime in Kent,\nand will become a department of\nthe University of Greenwich.\nThe second section, which will be\nhived off from the NRI, is the\ncompany in whom Imperial\nCollege will own a25% stake and\nwhich will control the \u00a325\nmillion research budget.\nNR International, this new\ncompany, is due to come into\noperation within three months.\nWith the first part of the\nprogramme, transferring control\nof the NRI from the ODA to\nGreenwich University occurring\nlast week, NR International is\ndue to begin trading on 1 August\n1996.\nThe Natural Resources\nInstitute is the vehicle through\nwhich the government provides\nscientific and technical expertise\nin renewable and natural\nresources for the overseas aid\nprogramme. The Overseas\nDevelopment Authority is committed to provide funding at\ncurrent levels for the next five\nyears with the expectation that\nbetter value for money can be\ngained by this latest privatisation.\nUnder the programme\naccepted by the Government,\nNR International will put\nresearch programmes out to\ntender, accepting those which\nprovide the best value for money.\nIt is expected that Imperial itself\nwill naturally submit bids for\nmany of the proposals. The\ncomplementary nature of the\nfour shareholders was emphasised by Prof Archer as he\nsuggested that with Edinburgh's expertise in veterinary matters,\nWye's concentration on agricultural research, and Imperial's well known ecological excellence,\n\"nobody will be stepping on each\nother's toes.\"\n\n"

Pick any one song to listen to it, and you\nwill be wowed by the sheer pop genius. listen to\nall eighteen (count 'em) and you are in danger of\nhaving your brain crawling into your stomach, in the hope that digestion will drown out the bowel-churning ly irritating clam our that the music\nbecomes. So good you shake your head in won der, so annoying it makes your hair ache.\nFor each song, (9).

Say what\nyou will about the govern-ment, it is schools and universities that inflict the most discomfort on students by insisting on 'inviting' us to while away\nour summers slowly filling our heads with huge\namounts of information over several weeks so\nthat it may be totally emptied in about three\nhours. So, dear reader, when it's really getting\nyou down, when the prospect of BSc (London)\nafter your name seems to have the same cachet\nas membership of the Tufty Club, remember\nthese words, which I read somewhere recently:\n'Don't let the seeds stop you from enjoying the\nwatermelon.' Of course, if you don't like water-melon, you're bugger ed. Can't win 'em all.\nIt was nice to see that the Care in the\nCommunity programme has been vindicated by\nthe NUS's decision to moderate their stance on\nstudents grants. These angry young men and\nwomen really are now much more calm and less\nexcitable, and may soon be permitted to write\npolicy motions in bir o rather than crayon (I gather that moves to change the Executive's stance\non the flatness of the Earth are not yet com-ple te). It would seem that the main protagonist\nof this change is my good friend G hassan Karian,\nfoot soldier in the Blair Army and president of\nULU - Well done, Sarah on your bid to succeed\nhim. He seems to have persuaded the m ish mash of\nTrotskyists and Marxists (i.e. the moderates) within the\nNUS to accept New\nSolutions, which, although\nflawed and sketchy, is a bit\nmore realistic and at least a step in the opposite direction.\nTime will tell if the wicked cynics are proved\ncorrect and Uncle Tony gives Ghassan that nice\nsafe Labour seat he has set his heart on.\nThis week has been surprisingly busy both in\nand out of college. I have seen an enormous\namount of balls, and I don't mean the College\nEstates Development Plan, but rather the World\nSnooker Championship, won un surprisingly by\nStephen Hendry, which has been riveting, as was\nthe climax of the Premiership. I'm not a football\nfanatic, but it has been a great season.\nThe BSE fiasco rumbles on, the Union\ndeciding to announce that their beef is non-British, following a sign I saw in the JCR\nannouncing the same about College Catering.\nWhile I do not eat in the Union often enough to\npass judgement on this decision, other than that\nI would have expected a slightly more rational\nresponse from a student body entirely populated by scientists, the concern of College catering\nis hilarious. You cannot imagine how delighted\nwe are that you care about your customers so\npassionately. Anyway, I ate in Linstead for a year\nand I'm damned if if I ever found anything of\nbovine origin. 'Bollocks!' I hear you cry, and\nmaybe you're right.\ntheatre: skirmishes iu as Despite needing meaning to their lives,\nthe characters in Skirmishes have, accord-ing'to this press release, reached 'a point\nof indifference where it really doesn't matter what they do or why they do it. A point located on the edge of the black\nholes inside their eyeballs'. Now, this is\neminently quotable stuff, but considering\nhow portmanteau stories (as this one is)\ncan often be disappointing (a recent cinematic example is Four Rocims), it is interesting to see how this play can break preconceived notions.\nLondon is the setting for this patchwork\nplay which consists of four contemporary tales.\nThese cover subjects like the anger of youth to\nthe sociopath ic nature of misanthropy. Neil\nBiswas is certainly a dynamic writer, able to\neffectively convey anything from profane, belligerent street slang to the detached, cyclical,\nseemingly irrelevant speech of autism. But apart\nfrom the already quoted link (and even that is\ntenuous) and the fact that they are all set in the\nCapital, this play lacked a convincing overall\nschema ta. Maybe that was the point - to present\nthese disparate tales together in order to try and\nmake unlikely associations, but this meant it lost\nits coherence and cogency.\nThe acting did not have any tangible vi bran cy, energy or urgency. This was a shame, as\nRobert Pepper's mainly action-led direction was\noften focused and balanced. An effective\nattempt at a multimedia production was made\nby flashing transient dream-like images of the\ntales on numerous TV screens between the\ninstallments. These were accompanied by an\nappropriately weeping and dissonant cello.\nOther music included the sweet Motown\nrhythms of the 60's and the hell-on-earth techno anthems of the 90's. Skirmishes may not be for everyone's palate,\nbut nonetheless is a disturbingly real portrayal of\nLondon life.\n\n"
