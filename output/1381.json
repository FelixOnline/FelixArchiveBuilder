The first meeting of 2007-08 is taking\nplace in the UDH on Monday 9 October. Nominations are open now, get your bums on those seats!\nCouncil nominations are now open\nOn Saturday 29th September the nominations for positions on the Council committee and the Trustee Board\nopened. There are 16 positions open\non Council and another two places on\nthe Trustee Board. Undergraduates\nand postgraduates are both eligible to\nstand for election between now and\nSunday 14th October when nominations for both committees close.\nCouncil is a well-established and\nlong running committee that meets\nevery month to discuss and vote on\nUnion policies. Anyone can turn up\nto the meetings and voice their views.\nPolicies can be offered up for discussion at Council by any Full Member of\nthe Union. That means you, me and\neveryone else. Students at Imperial are\nautomatically Full Members. You can\nopt out of this membership if you really don\u2019t like the Union, for whatever\nreason you can come up with.\nCouncil\u2019s philosophy is that any student can raise any point that they deem\nnecessary for the Union to discuss.\nFormally, the process of discussion is\nbrought about by submitting a written\nreport to the Union during the week\nbefore the actual Council session. This\ngives the other members who\u2019ll be attending a chance to read the report in\npreparation for discussion and dissection come the day of the meeting.\nMost of the major changes in the\nUnion from previous years were discussed at Council. For instance, it was\ndecided by a vote at Council last year\nthat a referendum for NUS (National\nUnion of Students) affiliation should\nbe held. The vote was passed and the\nsubsequent referendum saw Imperial\nrejoin the NUS. Other reports tabled\nand passed last year included an environmental policy that ensures the\nUnion does its bit to help curb Climate\nChange and a couple of comedy policies such as the \u2018Mike the Micrometer\u2019\npolicy which banned students from\nstealing the Union mascot.\nCouncil meetings will take place in\nthe Union Dining Hall every month this\nyear, the first of which will take place\non Monday 8th October. The committee is chaired by Mark Mearing-Smith.\nHe is joined by various Officers of the\nUnion, such as the Faculty Union Presidents and the chairs of the many subcommittees within the Union.\nHowever, there are many positions\navailable to regular students.

The Trustee Board is the\nhighest body in the Union and it has\nthe final say on any decisions. It\u2019s intended to be less of a discussion forum\ncompared to Council but if you\u2019re feeling bold enough to have a say in some\npotentially highly important decisions,\nthis is the committee for you. to sit on.\nThere are two positions for any Full\nMembers of the Union to stand for.\n\n"

Focusing on the plasticised, overpolished image of the cheerleader, Hume creates a powerful take\non contemporary American culture. Though leaning towards the precious at times, the White Cube is\nnonetheless an important player on the capital\u2019s art scene and neatly slots into a day spent wandering the\nstreets of Shoreditch.\nWhitechapel Gallery,\nWhitechapel High Street\nOne of the first public galleries in London, the Whitechapel Gallery is excellent for both its\ninternational collections and its great focus on local projects and Asian exhibitions, as well as\ndiversifying into film and music. Showing now is American artist Sarah Morris\u2019s sixth film,\nRobert Towne, based on the legendary Hollywood director, producer, actor and writer. Panoramic cityscapes meld with mesmerising white lines and circles, set off with an undertone of\ncorporate conspiracy and corruption. The gallery is due to double its space in 2008, which will\nbring welcome space to its cramped galleries in the shadow of the city.\nTate Modern, Bankside\nThis incredible space on the South Bank is justifiably one of the best galleries in the world.\nArchitects Herzog & de Meuron transformed an empty shell into a brooding behemoth with\ninnovative exhibitions that only the massive space its turbine hall affords and tiny enclaves\nscattered throughout the gallery that encourage you to pause to think and take it all in. And\nis there a lot to take in - as its namesake suggests, it houses a gargantuan array of some of the\nworld\u2019s best contemporary art. Particularly good are its surrealist and impressionist collec-tions. Also excellent is its collection of abstract expressionist works - don\u2019t miss the powerfully atmospheric room dedicated to Rothko. Consider taking in the rest of the South Bank\non your way out.\nNext Week \u2013 Theatres\nSaatchi Gallery, South Bank\nThe Saatchi Gallery charges admission - not great for your stereotypically impoverished student - but is worth it to\nsee the rich array of work from the famous and infamous. Many works you may have read about falling into the latter\ncategory will be housed here - the gallery is strong on YBAs and you will find Hirst\u2019s powerful - and now rumoured\nto be leaking - formaldhyde displays, including the showstopping tiger shark encased in unadulterated three-dimensional glory. Also present is Tracy Emin\u2019s controversial \u201cMy Bed\u201d amongst other pieces, and a strong collection\ndisplaying the best of American artists now. Oft overlooked for its larger stablemates, the Saatchi punches above\nits weight. Afterwards consider popping into the County Hall, which houses the 3000 sq foot Dali Universe and an\nongoing exhibition of works by Nasser Azam. You can also reach the gallery from Westminster tube.\nWritten by David Paw, designed by Rosie Grayburn\n\n"

Hopefully, most of us can\nsit through a Die Hard movie without\npointing out how unlikely most of the\nevents are. But when it comes to books\nand television on so-called \u2018popular science\u2019, it\u2019s hard to take a lot of it\nseriously.\nThe first thing that should make you\nsit up and listen about How To Fossilise\nYour Hamster is the simple white lettering at the top that spells \u2018New Scientist\u2019. You know then, at least, that it\u2019s\nnot going to be another Channel 4 \u2018unbiased\u2019 documentary on global warm-ing. If you don\u2019t read every copy of\nNew Scientist you can get your hands\non, you\u2019re missing out.\nBut New Scientist\u2019s previous offerings in the stocking-filler books department haven\u2019t exactly been grip-ping. Their last two books, Why Don\u2019t\nPenguin\u2019s Feet Freeze? and Does Anything Eat Wasps? were packed full of\nreally interesting questions previously\npublished and answered in the fortnightly periodical, but they were, on\nthe whole, just a bunch of questions.\nWhat they needed was something\nmore visual. More exciting. In short,\nwhat they needed was a method for\nextracting iron from crushed Kellogg\u2019s\nFrosties.\nAlright, that wasn\u2019t exactly what we\nneeded from a book (though it\u2019s one of\nthe most bizarre and absorbing experiments in the latest release). But it\u2019s one\nof the many crazy experiments contained inside that really make this book\na stand-out among other similar titles.\nBy retaining the cool, clear and collected New Scientist style, but throwing in a bag of tricks that would make\nPaul Daniels jealous, Mick O\u2019Hare and\nhis team have created a compendium\nof brilliant experiments.\nAnd, in true New Scientist style,\neverything is clearly explained, too. So\nyou\u2019re not simply shown how to make\nfried eggs turn green (they manage to\ndo it without using eggs they forgot\nabout for five weeks, too), but you\u2019re\nexplained how this process takes place,\nand where to go if you\u2019re interested to\nlearn more.\nThe experiments are, on the whole,\nvery fresh and extremely simple. You\ncan make mouldable plastics with just\nsome milk and vinegar or measure the\nspeed of sound with a hammer, and\nmany of you will be pleased to know\nthat a good deal of the experiments\ninvolve alcohol of some form (want\nto know why beer doesn\u2019t froth up if\nyou pour it into a wet glass? This is the\nbook for you).\nAdmittedly, there are some you\u2019ll\nhave seen before. A few will no doubt\nbring back dire memories of Year Seven science lessons \u2013 celery with food\ncolouring, anyone, or can we all remember how plants drink? \u2013 but the\nbook isn\u2019t entirely for science students,\nso some of the experiments are kid-friendly too, and even these are often\ngood fun, such as the urine-based experiments which never fail to entertain\nat parties. But most of them are spectacular enough to show off to friends\n\u2013 firing the lids off of film cannisters,\nor making sparks with just an envelope\nand a dark room.\nSome of the experiments are espe-Putting the pop into Pop Science\nNew Scientist\u2019s books are back \u2013 it\u2019s out with Q&A, and in with Fizz, Bang, Wallop, says Michael Cook\nFirst lines\n\u201cExperiments are what makes\nScience tick. Observing, recording\nand observing again have taught\nus everything we know about our\nuniverse and the world around us.\u201d\ncially fun to demonstrate in front of\nothers \u2013 one involves a pear and an ap-ple, and allows you to completely distort your guinea pig\u2019s sense of taste \u2013\nand if you brush up on your knowledge\nof the science behind it, some of them\ncan become truly geeky party pieces\n(see right for our favourites from the\nbook).\nPopular Science books quite rightly\ngarner quite a bit of scorn from some of\nImperial\u2019s masses. But a book like this\nis a hell of a lot cleverer than a retelling\nof the Big Bang with topical political\njokes thrown in. They\u2019re not going to\nhelp you an awful lot with your course,\nbut they unveil the mysteries behind\nsome conundrums that you may never\nhave quite grasped \u2013 indeed, some that\nyou may not have even realised existed\nat all.\nAnd so in that respect, it\u2019s a great success on New Scientist\u2019s part \u2013 finally\nConclusive results\nOur favourite experiments from the book\nrealising that we\u2019d like to get hands-on\nwith popular science, instead of sitting\nthrough another episode of Horizon\nabout bionic pet monkeys.\nWith sixty-odd experiments in the\nbook, it seems well worth the price\ntag given that most of the experiments\nrequire no extra materials at all. If you\nenjoy the writing style, the other books\nin the series are similarly-priced and\nworth reading, but O\u2019Hare\u2019s latest is\nclearly the best of the bunch.\nNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m off to\nbrutalise some Frosties.\nHow To Fossilise Your Hamster is\nbeing published for New Scientist\nby Profile Books, and will cost\naround \u00a37.99. We\u2019re bookcrossing\none copy at Imperial during\nOctober \u2013 see our article this\nweek for more information or surf\nto http://www.bookcrossing.org.\nThe \u201cHo! What Devilry Is This!\u201d Do-it-yourself-cloud-chamber Trick\nA two-litre drinking bottle, a little bit\nof water, and a match. Fill the bottle a\nlittle with water, then light the match.\nBlow it out, and (very) quickly drop it\nin the bottle, screwing the lid on tight\njust after.\nSqueeze the bottle four or five times,\nand a cloud-like vapour will begin to\nform inside the bottle. It\u2019s mesmerising\nto watch \u2013 you\u2019ve just created a cloud\nchamber. And better still, squeezing\nthe bottle tight makes the whole thing\ndisappear temporarily.\nMost Likely To Impress \u2013 Harry Potter fans, provided you wear a hat.\nThe \u201cBad Science, Good\u201d Implausible-yet-awesome-liquisolid Trick\nThis one really messes up any conception of materials you might have had.\nFor this, you\u2019ll need 300g cornflour\nand 250ml water. Mix it up in a bowl or\nsaucepan. Keep mixing. Keep mixing.\nEventually, you\u2019ll find it too stiff to mix\nany further.\nNow stop mixing, and tip the bowl\ninto another container. The entire mixture will have become liquid again.\nThe real fun starts once you find\na hammer or a large brick wall. The\nwhole soup becomes more plastic the\nmore it is exposed to intense force.\nShattered bits of the mixture will even\nliquefy and join together again.\nMost Likely To Impress \u2013 Anyone who\nthought that melting bit in Terminator\n2 was cool. So, basically everyone.\nThe \u201cIt\u2019s David Bowie! Hey, Man!\u201d Alka-Seltzer-lava-lamp Trick\nFill a two-litre water bottle \u2013 they\u2019re\ncheap from the JCR \u2013 three quarters\nfull with vegetable oil (yes, after you\u2019ve\ntaken the water out) and then pour a\nlittle water in. Use some food colouring if you\u2019re feeling particularly flash.\nThen get an alka-seltzer tablet and\nbreak it into eight pieces or therea-bouts. Drop a little bit in.\nThe tablet falls harmlessly through\nthe oil, before reaching the water and\nreacting. Globs of water, propelled by\ncarbon dioxide, rise the oil and when\nthey reach the top, the gas escapes, and\nthe water descends again. Awesome.\nMost Likely To Impress \u2013 People from\nthe seventies.\nThe \u201cRipley? RIPLEY!?\u201d Alien-egg-in-a-jar Trick\nAn empty glass jar, cleaned out and full\nof vinegar. Plop an egg into it \u2013 don\u2019t\nmake the mistake we did and choose\nan egg too big, or you\u2019ll spend five minutes pouring vinegar all ove r yourself\nwhile you try to pry it out.\nAfter a couple of days, the entire of\nthe shell will have disappeared, the egg\nwill have swollen to a massive size, and\ntaken on a ghostly, pale appearance. It\u2019s\nquite disturbing, but also very cool. To\nsome people, at least.\nYou can even reverse the effect if\nyou\u2019ve got the right ingredients \u2013\nthough of course, the shell doesn\u2019t\nreturn.\nMost Likely To Impress \u2013 Let\u2019s face it,\nno-one.\n\n"

Kaku\ncan clearly gain unparalleled access\nto institutes at the forefront of their\nfields, and this provides plenty of gee-whizz moments, such as seeing a functioning windpipe, grown from cultured\ncells on a matrix which can later be absorbed by the body, or when he shows\na working example of a metamaterial,\nan \u201cinvisibility cloak\u201d for microwaves.\nThe science-fiction crowd gets plen-ty: wild-eyed speculation about the\nfuture, often courtesy of gurus such\nas Ray Kurzweil; philosophising about\nfuture technologies will affect our perceptions of the human condition, such\nas a discussion on how space-elevators\nbuilt from nanotubes will provide us\nall with a truly planetary outlook; and\noccasional barrages of clips from classic films \u2013 A for Andromeda and that\nstalwart workhorse, The Day The\nEarth Stood Still, amongst others.\nToo much of this is guaranteed to\nrepel the average viewer, but Kaku\ndeftly avoids this by including plenty of\nhuman-interest stories, illustrating the\nimpact a particular technology has had\non someone.\nIn his new programme Kaku, soothsayer extraordinaire, outlines what to expect from future technology\nA good example of this is in the second episode: Kaku introduces the well-spoken parents of Alexander Locke,\nwho explain that as a baby he suffered\nfrom what was eventually diagnosed as\nSevere Combined Immune Deficiency\n(SCID), commonly known as the bub-ble-boy condition. Those afflicted have\nno protection against bacterial, viral or\nfungal infections, and bleak prospects\n\u2013 few outlive their first year. Replacing\nLocke\u2019s bone marrow, to allow a new\nimmune system to grow was ruled out,\nas no suitable donor could be found.\nFortunately, Locke\u2019s version of the\nEdmund Henley\nScience Editor\ncondition was genetic, so their doctor\nmooted gene therapy as an alternative.\nDr. Gaspar explains they cultured bone\nmarrow stem cells from Locke, using\na virus to introduce a working version\nof the gene into the cells, which were\nthen reintroduced into the child. The\nrelief with which the parents explain\nthe dramatic improvement in Locke\u2019s\ncondition is palpable, and makes this\ncase a highly engaging example of how\ncutting-edge research can affect ordinary people.\nNor does Kaku shy away from discussing the double-edged nature of\nthese advances; he is keen to stress that\nthough many technologies may prove\nbeneficial, others raise concerning is-sues. As well as inherent risks \u2013 nanotechnology and the \u201cgrey goo\u201d scenar-io, he pays close attention to the risks\nposed to the structure of society.\nIn a discussion on robots and emo-tions, and our tendency to project the\nlatter onto the former (\u201cbecause they\nlisten so well\u201d, as one pundit puts it),\nProfessor Susan Greenfield mentions\nan experiment she performed on a\ngroup of 8 year-old Australians. When\nasked if they whom they would prefer\nto keep their best friend or to swap\nthem for QRIO, an all-singing all-dancing humanoid robot, the choice\nwas unanimous. And yet the accompanying footage of QRIO makes one\nthink it wouldn\u2019t always be a bad deal.\nCertainly not for one\u2019s duller friends.\nGreenfield raises another more serious concern later, pointing out that the\n\u201cproblems of colonialism in the 19th\ncentury may pale in significance to [\u2026]\nthe differentiation of people into the\ntechno-haves and the have-nots.\u201d Although a well-worn argument, and already an issue for much of the world\u2019s\npopulation, it gains a new significance\nwhen watching this programme: even\nviewers from techno-Babylons like Imperial could find themselves on the losing side if they do not always submit to\nthe cutting edge of technology \u2013 how\ndo you fancy your chances in exams\nwhere fellow students have chip-en-hanced memories?\nThe series is not entirely without\nflaws: gratuitous shots of Kaku walking spring to mind. Even though MIT\nmay be more attractive than Imperial,\nsurely it\u2019s not worth marathon-length\nperambulations? And rather more ir-ritatingly, the turnover of science footage occasionally borders on the relent-less. Surely the public\u2019s attention span\nis not that poor? Nevertheless, these\nare minor quibbles; the programme is\nwell-worth seeing. Make sure you do!\nSongbirds, sticklebacks and Swedish tardigrades: this week\u2019s hella mashup\nMagnetic vision in migratory birds\nCertain migratory birds are known to\nuse Earth\u2019s magnetic field as their main\nmeans of orientation for their journey,\nbut the precise mechanism has been\nunclear.\nOne hypothesis has favoured a new\nmagnetic sense, mediated by magnet-ite, another has suggested it\u2019s linked to\nvision. Recent research on adult garden\nwarblers has suggested it\u2019s the latter.\nA research group from the University of Oldenburg, Germany, examined the interconnection of molecules\nknown as cryptochromes, found in\nretinal neurons and thought to be able\nto sense the magnetic field direction,\nand Cluster N, an area of the birds\u2019\nforebrain which is highly active during\nmagnetic orientation.\nThey found the retinal neurons and\nCluster N were linked via a visual\npathway known as the thalamofu-gal pathway. They suggest this means\nthese night-migratory birds perceive\nthe magnetic field as a visual pattern \u2013\nthey can \u201csee\u201d it.\nFish and chips\nBy looking at chips and scratches on\nthe surface of 10 million year-old fossil stickleback teeth, researchers from\nLeicester and Stony Brook (USA) have\nbeen able find direct evidence for\nchanges in an animal\u2019s feeding habit\nUrsula Skohpe\naffecting its evolution, usually a hard\ntask according to Purnell et al., who say\nattempts to determine if changes in the\nanimal\u2019s body are due to changes in its\nfeeding habits risk becoming circular.\nTheir findings, published in Science,\ncompare the fossil chips and scratches\nwith those of present day stickleback\n(both lab-based and wild), as the marks\nindicate the type of diet the fossil fish\nwould have had, assuming these marks\nwere due to the same diet as modern\nfish. They find that a change to a diet\nfound near the bottom of lakes precedes an increase in the spiky armour\nof the fish by about 100 years, suggesting the fish had to rapidly evolve\nto adapt to their new environments.\nA later shift to a diet from shallower\nwaters is taken as evidence supporting\nthe view that the previous change to\na high-armour body went against the\ngradient of natural selection, so when\npossible, the change was reversed.\nIt\u2019s cold outside...\nFortunately, tardigrades can\u2019t scream.\nAnd besides, famously, no-one can\nhear you in space. But if the participants in a recent experiment come\nout with their lives, one imagines they\nwould be protesting volubly.\nDespite being naturally aquatic,\nthese invertebrates (0.1-1.5mm long),\nwere selected to be astronauts au na-turel, as they can survive intense cold\nand dehydration.\nAccordingly, as part of the FOTONM3 mission mentioned last week, a\nteam led by Ingemar J\u00f6nsson (Kris-tianstad University, Sweden) set out to\nsee if they could survive in space.\nTheir experiment, dubbed TARDIS\n(how big is the inside of a tardigrade?)\nexposed one set of dry beasts to both\nthe effects of the vacuum and solar ra-diation, and the other set merely to the\nvacuum.

What sounded\nlike an ancient battle and caused curious (or fearful?) looks from Ethos staff\nand passers-by was actually a national\nsports event. It was a competition in\nkendo, the Japanese martial art of the\nsword. This year\u2019s kyusha taikai - a\ncompetition for kendo players with\nless than three years experience - took\nplace at Imperial College. Organised\nby the British Kendo Association this\nindividuals competition allows junior\nrank practitioners to test their skills\nagainst others from across the country\nin a set of refereed sparring matches.\nThe competition consisted of two\npreliminary fights, followed by quarter and semi-finals, and the final itself\nwith judges including Matsumoto-sensei, 7th Dan and coach of the British\nKendo squad.\nApproximately 60 competitors from\nthroughout the country came to take\npart in the main competition, another\n30 kendo practitioners attended a referee training seminar before hand and\neven more kendo players came to help,\nto watch and to join the friendly prac-ticeafterthecompetition.Toflytheflag\nfor Imperial our kendo club sent three\ncompetitors: Daniel Wagner, Chris Argyakis and Tim Simpson, who joined\nthe club last October and now had to\nstand their first solo competition.\nEarly rounds saw Tim Simpson eliminated by a competitor almost double\nhis age, showing that in kendo age, size\nand strength don\u2019t matter - technique\nand spirit are the keys. Pushing further\ninto the competition Chris Argyrakis\novercame Kim Towler of Shyunpukan\nbefore having the misfortune to compete with our own Daniel Wagner.\nBesting Chris in a stern fight Daniel\nsteamed through his opponents from\nCambridge and Edinburgh before being undone by J. Sitzmann (Nagamit-su, Birmingham) in the semi-final.\nSitzmann finally won the competition\nagainst S. McDonald. Daniel therefore\nachieved a joint 3rd place together with\nS. Sykes-Moore.\nOverall the competition day was a\ngreat success. Everybody enjoyed the\nrelaxed atmosphere at Ethos and the\nfriendly practice afterwards with almost sixty people fighting at the same\ntime was just amazing. Finally - as\nusual in the kendo community - many\npeople went for dinner and drinks together after crossing swords with each\nother.\nWe now look forward to a new year\nof training and to many new students\njoining us as the academic year begins.\nFor more details about kendo and\nour club visit our union website.\nWith no organisation, no plan and little\ncommunication the Imperial Windsurf\nClub somehow managed to attend the\nannual Animal Windfest in Sandbanks,\nPoole. Our travel arrangements may\nhave been reminiscent of Trains, Planes\nand Automobiles (just missing the hu-mour) but we made it. Greeted by sea,\nsand and\u2026perfect sunshine there were\ncertainly no complaints when we got\nthere. With BMX and wakeboarding\ndisplays, Zap Cat racing and beach volleyball there was no shortage of things\nto see and do...oh and the free beer\nvan was a bonus. We even managed to\nsqueeze in some beginner windsurfing lessons by our qualified instructors in the perfect learning conditions\nSaturday presented. All this in baking\nsunshine, beautiful scenery and a very\nrelaxed atmosphere.\nAs the sun set on a good day our attentions turned to fish and chips and\nthe legendary Parkway Fish Bar\u2026if\nyou haven\u2019t been, you\u2019re missing out.\nUnfortunately we did miss out on the\nSaturday night thanks to some sterling\ndirections from Niall, but none the less\nfish and chips were acquired elsewhere\nand still tasted good with a with a glass\nof wine at sunset. With the important\nmatter of food sorted the next activity\non the weekends itinerary was the official party, unfortunately our lack of\norganisation even hit the part of the\nwindsurf club that\u2019s usually meticulously planned, the party. Fortunately\nwe had Hannah to send wheeling and\ndealing for a couple of extra after party\ntickets. While Hannah bartered for the\nhighly sought after tickets the rest of\nthe club were entertained by Nick and\nDom (you know there might be a TV\nshow in it, but probably not a children\u2019s\none). So why were tickets so hard to\ncome by? Well taking a few bands,\nadding a few thousand outdoor enthusiasts and mixing them together in one\nbig tent you get quite a potent formula,\nI think fun was had by all!\nHaving overlooked transport, food\nand party tickets what else could we\nhave left to the last minute? Well\nsomewhere to stay would\u2019ve have\ncome in handy. As the chaos of the\nWindfest Party concluded we thought\nit was about time to start considering\nthe issue of accommodation. Although\nI missed out on the spectacle I think\nthe 3 am erection of acquired tents on\na dark beach was quite probably rather\nentertaining.\nAs the sun returned for Sunday it\nbrought a little wind. Perfect for our\nintermediate sailors to get out and refine their skills. The wind continued\nto build throughout the afternoon and\neventually gave us enough to run the\nUK Freestyle Championships. The\nclub training trips to Egypt and Greece\nlast year along with numerous excursions to the coast clearly paid off, as\ndespite the previous nights exertions,\nclub member Chris B is now the UK\nAmateur Freestyle Champion; an excellent effort and a well deserved title for him. This result is just one of\nmany highlighting personal and club\nachievement in the past year. For a\nlandlocked university Imperial continually punches way above its weight\nin student competition, finishing 3rd\nin the overall Student Windsurf Series\nlast year.\nThe IC windsurf club offers a great\nopportunity for those of any level keen\nto get out on the water. With qualified instructors and club kit we cater\nfor all levels from beginner to winner\n(just add a sense of humour). We offer numerous trips throughout the\nyear (usually more organised than this\nspontaneous weekend). Our adventures range from day trips to the coast\naccompanied by our every willing in-structors, weekend trips to across the\ncountry, Student Windsurf Events including the Legendary Aussie Kiss festival (700 windsurfers, 3 live bands and\na wild wild west country theme, Cornwall here we come 24-27th October).\nAs well as numerous weekend breaks\nthe club also runs Easter and summer\nholidays to sunnier, windier parts of\nthe world.\nSome stick wielding action in Ethos at the national Kendo competition\nWindsurfers do Windfest\nWindfest Quick Facts\nParty factor 7/10\n(Good but Aussie Kiss sets the\nbar high)\nFaff to surf ratio 3:7\nSurprisingly good considering the\nparty factor!\nWeather rating 6.5\nSunny but could be windier\nImperial windsurfers spontaneously decide to take a trip to Windfest and, despite the lack of planning, win!\nNiall Thomson\nACROSS\n2 Drier around restricted tool (6)\n6 Pleasing plant (5)\n7 Instrument is back on the road (5)\n8 Rest disturbed after former lover\nmakes an effort (6)\n9 Employment of universal wise man\n(5)\n10 Embroidery is irritating, but has a\npurpose (11)\n17 Vital for music (5)\n19 Sorry to hear German sea feature\n(5)\n20 In the fog nothing is wet (5)\n21 Start shiatsu around America for\nfood (5)\n22 Blush from lying helps interpret\nimages (5, 6)\n27 Tread down to send it on its way\n(5)\n28 God has a plate for vegetable (6)\n29 Car carried by people (5)\n30 Sounds like I count a try (5)\nRead these words that I am about to put\nforth on this \u2018ere paper.

    "content": "food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFood\nFood Editor \u2013 Hannah Theodorou\n27\nFriday 5 October 2007 felix\nBread costs rising with global warming\nIt is wrong to say that extreme weather\nevents are \u201ccaused by\u201d man\u2019s pollution\n\u2013 as of course, they used to happen any-way. However, we can certainly say that\nthe recently observed trend of extreme\nweather events increasing in both intensity and frequency is typical of the\npredictions made by climate experts.\nIt\u2019s basically explained by the increased\nenergy in the system. And it\u2019s pushing\nup the price of bread! Yes students everywhere will have been hit hard by the\nnews that adverse weather has doubled\nthe price of a bushel of wheat within a\nyear and now upped your Sainsbury\u2019s\nloaf by five percent. Prices started to\nrise last year when the worst drought\nin decades devastated crops in Australia, then the third-biggest exporter\nof the grain. Dry weather has also hurt\nwheat plants in Ukraine and Russia,\nbut it was excessive precipitation that\ndamaged fields in the U.S. and Europe!\nAs an ex-investor, I understand\nthat this is typical of a global theme\nwhich we may well be hearing more\nabout: that of limited supply stretching to meet exponentially advancing\ndemand. As emerging markets boom,\nand commodity fund managers specu-late, the prices of wheat, gold and oil\nare all soaring upwards \u2013 not pleasing\nto economists while US growth seems\nto be slowing considerably. What\u2019s really worrying is that climate change,\nover what timescale nobody knows,\ncould well turn out to be a very serious stressor in the system, as humanity\nattempts to pass through an environmental bottleneck of overpopulation\nand wasteful over-consumption.\nNevertheless we Imperial students\nwill be the ones solving this problem,\nso we need to eat! Plus, we need to eat\ncheaply, and bread of course remains\none of the cheapest options out there.\nSo, in the first passionate attempt by\nthis column to improve the food you\nconsume, I am throwing out there two\nuses for bread which verge on magic.\nThey demonstrate that creating lovely\nfood out of cheap ingredients is not\nonly easy but actually quite satisfying.\nA little bit of effort goes a long way,\nand that is the magic of cooking: that a\npermanent, cost less skill can multiply\npleasure a thousandfold. See below for\nthe bread ideas.\nOne criticism of the bread industry\nif I had to make one: all those nuts and\nseeds \u2013 not my thing at all. Their oils\n(sesame oil etc.) create a slightly nose-tickling heady aroma, which I would\nprefer to substitute for a malty granary\nhit. In fact my life-long favourite bread\nhas been the Baker\u2019s Oven/Gregs granary batch loaf. It has a wonderfully\nGlobal warming: one of the hottest talking points there is, but how does it affect the price of your loaf?\nmellow malty flavour, and when fresh a\nbrilliantly soft and doughy consistency\n\u2013 like memory foam that remembers\nyour shape when compressed. A bite\nof a sandwich with this stuff plugs the\nback of your front teeth and the top of\nyour mouth, like any really fresh bread\nshould\u2026 but then it somehow accepts\na film of mucus and disintegrates in\nmoist shreds like a steak, rather than\nin soggy clumps like a sponge, as your\naverage white will. But should you get\nit sliced in the shop? If you back your\nown slicing abilities, this will allow for\nflexibility in thickness: you can enjoy\nboth thick sliced cheese toasties, and\nthin sliced morcels with butter and\njam. However, sliced bread is the best\nNoel Forrest\nthing since before sliced bread for a\nreason, in my view \u2013 and it\u2019s not lazi-ness. The truth is that the machine has\nsurpassed man\u2019s abilities in creating\nneat slices. These neat slices are ideal\nfor sandwiches, where uniformity of\nthickness and clean edges ensure a\npleasing experience for the mouth and\nthe eyes.\nFinally, the best thing about bread is\nthat it\u2019s not meat, which brings us back\nto the climate change issue via the recent report in the Lancet. I\u2019m certainly\nno vegetarian, but 22% of CO2 emissions worldwide coming from agriculture (of which 80% meat) is quite\nshocking. Assuming a 40% increase in\nglobal population by 2050 and no advance in livestock-related greenhouse-gas reduction practices (can someone\ninvent a cow-fart igniter, please?), global meat consumption would need to\nfall to an average of 90g per person per\nday just to stabilise emissions from this\nsector \u2013 equivalent of one hamburger\nper person. Yes those high prices ought\nto curb demand, but the true cost to the\nenvironment/society is not included in\nthat price yet.\nSorry to sound like a wartime rationing evangelist, but eating less meat and\nmore bread, and being smug about doing clever stuff with it all, might just\nbe fun. But it doesn\u2019t appeal does it?\nThat\u2019s the tragedy. That\u2019s what we need\na solution to.\nIf you never do this you are an\nidiot and it\u2019s not my fault. Yes\nI admit it\u2019s not really a recipe\nbut in terms of enjoyment\nto effort ratio it stands out a\nmile \u2013 crispy, crunchy, buttery\ncroutons add so much to your\nfavourite soup.\n1) Saw the crusts off a few\nslices of bread\n2) Slice the middle bits into\nbig centimetre-ish squares.\n3) Fry until crispy and put\nin whatever soup you have\nbought or made\nNB: I prefer granary bread\nfried in butter, but any bread\nand anything to fry it in works.\nThis three-way hybrid of English bread and butter pudding,\nFrench pain perdu and Italian ravioli is Hugh FearnleyWhittingstall\u2019s answer to the\n\u201ccreeping autumn chill\u201d, and\nthe seasonal fruit glut we aren\u2019t\nexposed to enough in London.\nWarm the insides of somebody special then hide from\nthe elements somewhere else\nspecial.\nServes 2:\n1 egg\n1 egg yolk\n1 tablespoon caster sugar,\nplus extra for sprinkling\n2 tablespoons single or double\ncream\n3 tablespoons milk\n4 thick (1-2cm) slices of fresh\nwhite bread\nsoft butter\na couple of dozen raspberries\nsunflower oil for frying\n1) Make a simple raw custard by\nlightly beating together the egg,\negg yolk, caster sugar, cream and\nmilk. Cut the crusts off the bread\nand spread a little soft butter in\nthe middle of each slice (not to the\nedges, though, as it may prevent\nyou making the seal). Pile the raspberries into the centre of 2 slices\n(i.e. on top of the butter), squashing them together a bit. Sprinkle a\nlittle caster sugar over them. Take\nthe remaining 2 slices of bread and\nplace them, buttered side down,\nover the first. Squeeze the edges\nof the bread together firmly, making a seal all around the edges\n- you can use a little of the egg\ncustard, dabbed on with a finger,\nto help it stick. You end up with a\nbread \u2018cushion\u2019, like a giant raviolo,\nin which the raspberries are the\nstuffing.\n2) Pour the custard mixture into a\nshallow dish or deep plate and lay\nthe bread cushions in it to soak\nup the custard. Turn them several\ntimes, until well saturated. Heat\na good centimetre of untainted\nfresh oil in a frying pan. When it is\nhot enough to turn a test piece of\nbread golden in about a minute, lift\nthe eggy cushions with a spatula\nand slide them carefully into the\npan. When the underneath is fried\nto a deep golden brown, turn them\nover and fry till the other side is\ndone, too.\n3) Drain on kitchen paper, then\ntransfer quickly to warmed plates.\nBring some homeliness to your cooking with these two simple bread recipes\nDust with a little more caster sugar and serve straight away.\nYou can fill this lovely pud with\nall sorts of seasonal goodies besides raspberries: Bramley ap-ples, blackberries, plums, pears.\nBut raspberries will prove hard\nto beat.\n(Recipe reproduced with\nkind permission of www.\nrivercottage.net)T\nAutumn Bliss\nReal croutons for soup\nD\u2019oh, d\u2019oh and more d\u2019oh...\n\n"

    "content": "Justice: Two hot Frenchies, some music and a lot of love\nHoney Munroe (Photos by\nGreg Mead and M-A)\nNo matter how objective I try to be\nabout this, reading this article is going\nto be all about how great this festival\nwas. In all honesty this was one of the\nbest festival experiences I have had for a\nlong time and I just cannot say enough\ngood things about it. That is not to say\nthat there were no bad aspects, and I\nshall not be leaving them out, but overall these felt like small inconveniences\nin light of the entire experience.\nSo first things first, a few years\nyounger that Pukkelpop, Dour was set\nup in 1989 and had over 140, 000 people with just 6 stages and 225 bands.\nIt is spread over four days and I think\nthat is what gives the festival such a\nunique feeling of adventure and of lasting memories in that the extra day cements your new friendships and newfound love of the festival. You know\nyour way around and all that is left to\ndo is to spend all your food and drink\ntokens and to have an awesome time!\nMuch of the festival is staffed by volunteers and this year especially they tried\nto do their best to encourage recycling\nand for people to leave their camping\nfields as they had fond them.\nThis year was notably the first year\nthe festival site itself had far fewer chill\nout zones or shady lanes for avoiding\nsunburn and on the whole I think that\nthe general consensus from the festival goers was that they needed them\nback. The festival was roasting, even\non cloudier days so do not forget your\nhat, sunglasses and most importantly\nyour sunscreen.\nThe one thing you need to know\nabout this festival is that it is FAR. And\nby that I mean, FAR from where the\ncoach drops you and pretty far from\nany town where you can buy stuff.\nWhen you get off the Eurostar you get\na train and when you get off the train\nyou get a coach and when you get off\nthe coach you walk, dragging all your\nstuff what seems like an eternity to the\nmain site. The walk from the coach\ntakes you through an agricultural farm\nland with lots of huge barns or warehouses in the middle distance and forests and high trees out to the horizon.\nIt is beautiful and quiet and nothing\nlike home!\nWhen you get to the main site you\nneed to pay a great deal of attention\nbecause no one seems to know what is\ngoing on so look for signs that direct\nyou to where you pick up your ticket by\nusing your common sense. I.e. there is\na line of booths and each have a picture\nof a ticket with a sign for one, two, and\nthree or four days camping, so just ask\nyourself what ticket you have and get\nin line. Sounds a bit like an arbitrary\nstatement but you would not believe\nthe chaos caused by the staff not being properly briefed as to what was going on and the subsequent panic that\nseemed to ensue, even though one\ncould actually just look around with\none\u2019s own eyes and make a pretty good\nguess as to where you need to go. The\nincompetence of the entrance staff was\nalmost unbelievable and the ticket pick\nup had obviously been designed by a\ndrunk, but at least the pictures were\ndotted around were self explanatory\nenough. Not really an ideal situation\nand very frustrating if you have been\ntravelling for over 24hours already and\njust want someone to know how to\nshow you where your camping is.\nA beautiful site, set between two hilly\nsloped fields with great food and really well thought out stages and tents,\nagain, almost all without exception\nwere bigger and better than those at\nBritish festivals and the Dance arena\nwas a wooden floored fabulously lit\nand very long, big marquee which from\nabout 8pm was a banging club.\nOne of the most amazing nights at\nDour was in that very tent with an ultra\npimped line-up which for me, culminated in Justice. Tonight the Frenchies\nhad their finest hour and they were\nwarmly supported by fellow peers Busy\nP, Uffie and Feadz, Sebastien and DJ\nMehndi. Having seen Justice a fair few\ntimes now they can be either the best\nthing you\u2019ll ever have been wastedly\ndancing your night away to, or just a\nbit flat.\nAt Dour they were not only crowd\npleasing and entertaining and I don\u2019t\nthink they played one duff tune. That\nis not to say I can remember more than\none or two things they played anyway,\nbut I certainly can remember that I\ndidn\u2019t stop dancing and neither did anybody else in the crowd who cheered\nand laughed and by all accounts had a\ngreat time, rocking on till 5 am culminating in a Bugged Out set from British\nsuperstar Erol Alkan.\nAs is usual with European festivals\nthe stages are less full and the crowds\nmore relaxed and certainly that was no\nless true here at Dour, but what made\nDour so fantastic was that the crowds\nhad so much energy and enthusiasm.\nA little too much enthusiasm at The\nClub Arena dance stage where it wa\nso packed you just couldn\u2019t enjoy the\nawesome green lasers or sound as the\nmasses distorted the bass fuelled PA\nand to be honest, the sardine packed\ncrowd couldn\u2019t be justified as his set\nwas too minimal and repetitive.\nHot Chip were not only over-hyped\nbut awful and their only hit was ad-hocly rearranged into a totally tuneless\nand undanceable mish mash blatently\nredone on the fly.\nDJ Shadow was packed and actually delivered as his unmistakable style\ndrew crowds that packed out his arena\nso as to be a part of the action, with\npeople climbing up the pillars all the\nway to the tent roof, much to the annoyance of the security.\nThe first night in the Dance Arena\n\u201cIn all honesty\nthis was one of\nthe best festival\nexperiences I\nhave had for a\nlong time\u201d\nUffie, hitching a ride on Mehndi.

Write for us\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDavid Paw\nArts Editor\nW\nelcome to another\nshiny new edition\nof Felix Arts. As\nautumn draws in\nand the prospect of\nincreasingly longer nights looms large,\nwhat could be better than immersing\nyourself in the capital\u2019s arts scene?\nOur city is blessed with one of the\nmost vibrant arts scenes in the world.\nLondon will always feature on any top\nten list of galleries/museums/gig ven-ues/whatever anywhere you would\ncare to mention.The city has somehow\nfound a new vitality and optimism\nthat is reflected in the wealth of talent and potential brimming in venues\nand rehearsal studios from Hackney to\nHammersmith.\nSpeaking of which, with the exception of this year\u2019s freshers, who will\nhave more than enough to occupy\nthemselves with in West London, the\nthing I hear the most from people is \u201cI\nwant to get out of West London. I want\nto explore more of the city \u2013 I\u2019m living\nin London and I want to take advantage of it\u201d.\nThe problem is, where to start? The\ncapital is a vast place and the amount\nof things to do on offer can be over-whelming. Picking up a copy of Time\nOut is always a great start, as is checking listings on the internet.\nWith a little persistence and perseverance it will become easier to pick\nout the main venues or hotspots \u2013 say,\nHoxditch and Hackney in the east,\nClapham in the south or Camden in\nthe north.\nA common caveat is distance \u2013 why\ntrudge across town to go to a theatre\nwhen you could just walk down to the\nLyric to see a play? Quite often the\ncrowd and the people attending in different areas of the capital varies greatly,\nand the things on show can vary wildly\nas well. The atmosphere is often very\ndifferent as well \u2013 why limit yourself?\nGetting out and exploring the city you\nlive in always requires an initial effort\nbut it is one that pays dividends.\nThis week\u2019s arts section sees the\nsecond part of the Culture Crawl, this\ntime tackling London\u2019s galleries \u2013 even\nwith the number stacked on the page,\nthere were still several excellent galleries omitted, not to mention the multitude of microgalleries proliferating\nacross the city.\nCaz Knight has her perceptions of\nmusicals altered by an excellent production of Parade, while Mike Cook\ngets stuck into a book of experiments\nand comes out alive.\nFinally with the arrival of a new season at the English National Opera are\nmy thoughts on the company\u2019s radical\nproduction of the classic Carmen. As\nevening fell across the West End and\nI walked towards the Coliseum and\nits grand facade and uplit columns,\nI was glad that even as the temperature dropped and the layers were piled\non, those long nights were good for\nsomething.\nThe circus comes to town\nThe ENO\u2019s latest production leaves David Paw unmoved and unimpressed\nOnly after you\u2019ve sat through the flamboyant dances, the council estate cat-fights, the wraithlike chorus of schoolchildren in ghostly white, the preening\ntransvestite dancers flexing their biceps and the breakdancers, does the\nENO\u2019s newest incarnation of Carmen\nbegin to take shape. But only just.\nThe filmmaker Sally Potter (Orlando,\nThe Tango Lesson) was brought in to\nbreathe new life into that most familiar of operas and that most eternal and\niconic of femme fatales. It was always\ngoing to be radical, with injections of\nstreet tango from choreographer Pablo Veron and set designs by Es Devlin, who has worked with Kanye West\nin the past, amongst others. But while\nit certainly had the potential to be excitingly fresh yet still bring down the\nhouse with that power that only opera\ncan bring, it focused far too much on\nthe \u201cexciting\u201d , letting the music lag\nand introducing far too many conflicting elements for an audience to\ncomprehend while trying to follow the\nshow simultaneously.\nLet us recap \u2013 Carmen follows the\nstory of its title character, a fiery streetwalker who captures the heart of Jose,\nhereasecurityguard.Afteratete-a-tete\nwith another girl, Carmen is brought\nin an Jose told to guard her \u2013 he lets\nher escape and goes to prison himself\nfor his error. When Jose re-emerges, he\nswears to devote his existence to Carmen. However, when he receives word\nhis mother is on his deathbed, he reluctantly tears himself away from her.\nWhen he returns, Carmen is on the\narm of Escamillo, his love rival and a\ncelebrated matador on his way to another glorious bullfight \u2013 Carmen has\ngrown tired of Jose\u2019s petulance and\njealousy by now and though he begs\nher not to reject her she refuses, culminating in a dramatic finale.\nCarmen\u2019s main strengths lie in its\nmusic and narrative \u2013 the score was\ntempered well and was on fine form,\nand the vocal performances were\nmemorable only for Katie van Kooten\u2019s\npowerful Micaela and Julian Gavin\u2019s\nheroic performance as Jose. Alice\nCoote, as Carmen, was undermined by\na screeching chorus of streetwalkers\n(painful) or an incoherent production\nthat eliminated four of the original\u2019s\ndances. When Carmen says she will\ndance, she appears redundant when\nshe does not. Frasquita and Mercedes,\nCarmen\u2019s underlings-cum-friends and\nfellow maneaters, looked similarly ridiculous \u2013 how seriously can you take\nthese characters when they look like\nthey wandered off the set of a Shakespeare\u2019s Sister music video?\nIt was difficult to devote full concentration to the story \u2013 the circus had\nliterally come to town and there was\nfar too much distracting the viewer\u2019s\nattention from the main characters.\nWhen you weren\u2019t watching the stubborn Alsatian or the shimmying dancers seductively sashaying across the\nstage, you were watching the break-dancers throw huge power moves let\nalone following what was going on\nwith the main characters.\nThough Potter clearly wanted to introduce elements of celluloid into the\nmix with an introductory sequence of\nvoyeuristic real-time CCTV images\nprojected onto a thin screen while we\nwatched the actual characters behind,\nit became meaningless given the rest\nof the story had so little to do with its\norigins. There was simply far too much\nfocus on producing something radical,\nsomething visionary, when simplicity with a few simple touches would\nhave more than sufficed. For example\n\u2013 originally Jose is a soldier and his\ndesertion to be with Carmen makes it\nall the more dramatic. The impact of a\nsecurity guard quitting his job to warm\nhis evenings with a colourful temptress is less convincing. A police officer\nwould have been simpler and more ef-fective, though you can imagine it being turned down on the grounds of being far too safe, far too obvious.\nThere appeared flashes of inspiration however, rare moments when the\ndirector\u2019s vision worked \u2013 Habanera\nwas suitably electrifying while Veron\nand his partner Lucila Cionci were\nmesmerising in dancing their passionate and pure tango. The opening of the\nthird act worked very well, with the\nglimpses of a security guard\u2019s dancing\nfeet tapping across the screen gradually expanding to show a tunnel in pro-file. These were the moments when the\ndirector\u2019s vision paid dividends. Potter\nstated, \u201cthere is a paradoxical freedom\nin working with a classic \u2013 it has been\ndone and will be done so many times\nthat a potentially radical approach\ncannot possibly harm it\u201d. She obviously\nhad the opera\u2019s best interests in mind \u2013\npity she forgot about the audience\u2019s.\nENO\u2019s title character from the opera Carmen\n\n"

Not properly old,\nbut I\u2019m two decades into my innings here, and I\u2019ve been playing\ngames in one way or another\nnigh on fifteen years now. It\u2019s\nscary, when I think of it, even though\nmy usage at that age amounted to sitting and watching my Dad beat up an\nold Sinclair ZX Spectrum. I don\u2019t remember much of what we played. But\nwhat I do remember, quite vividly, was\nthe Amiga 600. I remember Zool. I remember Dizzy. I remember the EGGSONLEGS password that made him\nfly.\nTimes change, though, and I\u2019m fine\nwith that, really. Dizzy was good fun,\nbut I don\u2019t feel my brother has missed\nout, raised as he was on a healthy diet\nof Ratchet and Clank. In fact, for all the\nnew technology and fears of commercialism that plague gaming nowadays,\nit hasn\u2019t changed all that much in the\ntime I\u2019ve been playing. Governments\nrose and fell, we solved Fermat\u2019s Last\nEquation, but other than the Internet\ntaking multiplayer gaming up a notch,\nlittle has changed.\nLook at Doom\u2019s release, all those\nyears ago. Despite connection prob-lems, we downloaded and played it\nacross the world. Soon after, we played\nCommand and Conquer for the first\ntime, and dabbled in Ultima Online \u2013 a\nwhole world with monsters, cities, and\nreal people!\nNow, despite having massive game\nworlds and complex goals, the biggest hit of the moment is Valve\u2019s Team\nFortress 2 \u2013 which, despite connection problems, we\u2019ve downloaded and\nplayed across the world, with the basic\nformula of kill or be killed unchanged.\nAnd what else are we playing? Command and Conquer 3, and World of\nWarcraft \u2013 a game in which you live\nin a whole world with monsters, cities\nand real people!\nDon\u2019t take this as an attack on originality today \u2013 I think it\u2019s great that\ngaming is fundamentally unchanged.\nIt shows that we knew what fun was\nbefore we discovered complex physics engines and antiscopic filtering.\nThat my children will enjoy roughly\nthe same experiences I did, even if they\ncan actually tell what they\u2019re playing\n(which definitely wasn\u2019t the case with\nthe ZX Spectrum), is actually quite\nheartening.\nInstead, the similiarity of today\u2019s\ngaming world to yesterday\u2019s worries\nme that I may just be getting old. HalfLife 2 feels empty now, as I re-play it in\nanticipation of Episode 2. Quake Wars\nfeels bloated and overcomplicated.\nWorld of Warcraft seems like a gigantic waste of time.\nSo why do I get excited at the thought\nof a Deus Ex re-run? Why was I so determined to find a copy of the original\nBroken Sword? Why am I still involved\nin a painstaking play-by-email game of\nAlpha Centauri? If gaming is a fresh\nand new as it\u2019s always been, then how\ncome I\u2019m not having as much fun as I\nused to? Why don\u2019t I think the plots are\nas good any more, and why am I suddenly wondering if WASD wasn\u2019t such\na great invention after all?\nMaybe it\u2019s the first signs that age is\nsetting in, or that I should hook out the\nAmiga emulators and hunt out some\nROMs for The New Zealand Story, or\nattempt Superfrog again and actually\nfinish the damn thing this time.\nAnd maybe, maybe that\u2019s not such\na crime after all. I grew up with these\ngames, the comfort of two dimensions\nand the pitter-patter of a 56k modem\ngurgling its way through a phone line.\nIt\u2019s right. It\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s time for the\ntorch to be passed to the mewling thirteen year-old Counterstrike players\nof today, so that they can become the\nwhisky-sipping Civilisation IV players of tomorrow. And they, in turn,\nwill have their own fond memories\nof when screens were only 21-inch,\nand you could still buy games in high\nstreet shops, and the Master Chief\nhadn\u2019t been put in a spin-off kart racing series.\nAnd where will that leave me? Somewhere quiet, hopefully, with an 800mhz\nPentium, a copy of Unreal Tournament\nand Team Deathmatch on Morpheus.\nThose whippersnappers, I\u2019ll say, don\u2019t\nknow the meaning of multiplayer.\nWhy, I remember, back in the day,\nmy Dad would wrestle with a ZX Spectrum and a cassette player, and I\u2019d be\nglad if\u2026\nNow on Channel 4 it\u2019s time for Retro-Loco \u2013 When Nostalgia Attacks IV\nCan you spot the difference between the two games? If not, you are probably me, or in need of serious medical help. Or both\nZool\nDid you play Zool? Trick question, of\ncourse \u2013 everyone played Zool. If you\ndidn\u2019t play Zool, you wouldn\u2019t be reading a Games section right? Just in case\nyou didn\u2019t, here\u2019s what you missed out\non \u2013 other than my love \u2013 Zool was\na platformer for, among other things,\nthe Amiga. Featuring the titular ninja,\nfrom the Nth dimension, Zool was a\ncookie-cutter platformer when cookie-cutters were still in style.\nHe jumped, he kicked, he fired weird\norange amoeba from his hands. The\nbosses were leaping alarm clocks and\ngiant clown faces. It was sponsored\nby Chupa Chup lollies for Christ\u2019s\nsake \u2013 it was everything that was great\nabout that time in gaming, and reason\nenough for any of you to hook out an\nAmiga emulator and track down some\nROMs.\nSuperfrog\nSimilar to Zool, Superfrog was a cheery\ncartoon platformer that hit all the right\ntargets to become a classic on the\nAmiga and Amstrad. You\u2019re a frog. But\nyou have superpowers! You even have a\ncape, for chrissakes. If you thought Final Fantasy VII was missing something,\nit\u2019s probably a frog in a cape. But that\u2019s\nwhere Superfrog knocks Squaresoft\nout of the park, you see? Amateur\nmistake, guys.\nYou leapt, you soared, you collected fruit. It was the life not\njust of a frog, but a great frog. A\nsuper-frog, if you will. Supes is\nstillplayabletoday,thanks\nto a very smooth control system, and really\ncrisp graphics. Another one that\u2019s well worth\nemulating, particularly\nwith the decline\nof really good\nplatforming\non the\nPC.\nBill\u2019s Tomato Game\nNow, apparently, we\u2019re not allowed\nto use puzzles unless they describe\nthemselves as involving a \u2018physics engine\u2019, whatever the hell that means.\nBill\u2019s Tomator Game involved gravity,\nbut they managed to avoid using the\ndreaded phrase by focusing on things\nthat were actually fun, such as the fact\nyou got to bound and splat the red fruit\non trampolines, jack-in-the-boxes\nand through myriad obstacles.\nThe plot was gripping \u2013\nyou were tasked with rescuing your tomato-y girlfriend\nfrom the clutches of an evil\nsquirrel, but the only\nway to get to his\ntree-top lair was\nto propel yourself\nthrough eighty levels of crazy pump-kins, toy soldiers,\nwrecking balls and\npyramids.\nNone of this \u2018A\nhero never dies\u2019\ncrap. That\u2019s a real\nstory, right there.\nMonkey Island\nMonkey Island is a series that\u2019s still being matured by LucasArts, but judging\nby their handling of the latest Sam and\nMax outing, the originals may turn out\nto be their finest hour.\nYou\u2019re Guybrush Threepwood, a\nmightypirate,andnotonlycanyouhold\nyour breath for ten minutes, but you\u2019re\ngoing to learn even more\nuseful skills in your quest\nto become the mightiest\npirate in the Caribbean.\nSword-fighting that\u2019s\nbased on exchanging in-sults? Check. Zombie pirate with a wisecracking\nskeletal crew? Check. The\nsecond biggest monkey head\nyou\u2019ve ever seen? Check.\nMonkey Island still has\nsome of the best writing seen\nin gaming, and even less nostalgic gamers still revisit\nit year on year. Go\nfind it for the PC,\nbut expect to\nwrestle XP to\nrun it.\nPong\nNow this is a proper bloody game.\nNone of this graphics engine crap, or\nadvanced fuzzy AI, or massive mul-tiplayer, whatever that means. Why\nwould I want to play games with really tall people? They play the same as\nshort people.\nAnyway, Pong was proper solid.\nThere was up, down, sometimes up\nand then down really quickly. Fakies,\nI called it. Plus the ball \u2013 that was\nsome difficult shit. Was it going to bounce at the angle you\nexpected? Could you get to\nthe other side of the screen in\ntime? That was real tension.\nThen they tried to update it\nby making it 3D and adding\nin a Britney Spears license,\nand collectable weapons\nand downloadable skins for\nthe bats, but they\u2019re just\nselling out, man. Give me\na pen and paper any day.\nAnyone\nfor\nchess?\n\n"

To start with we were\nflying out of Heathrow not long after\nthe terrorist attack on Edinburgh airport which meant that security was so\ntight that you felt guilty by just going\nto the airport. Houdini wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen able to get out of there. That is\nif he was even able to check-in in the\nfirst place.\nThanks to some bright spark at BA\nthey no longer allow you to check-in in\none go. First off, you have to go to what\ncan only be described as a cash machine with PMT that asks you where\nyou would like to sit and then tells you\nthat\u2019s not possible. Now if you are planning on flying out off the country don\u2019t\ngo out the night before, get hammered\nand then get mugged because you need\nto feed that angry check-in machine\nwith a credit card that you won\u2019t have.\nSimilarly don\u2019t use your mums card to\nbook it if she\u2019s not going to be there,\nand ALWAYS ALWAYS write down\nthe confirmation number!!\nFinally after much more faffing than\nthere needed to be we had checked-in\non the machine, then at the luggage-drop off desk that you can\u2019t actually\ndrop luggage off if you have a bike box\nand gone through security. Thankfully\nthe rest of the journey there was un-eventful, until we got to the chalet at\n2am and Charlie had a 30 minute brain\ndead spell and couldn\u2019t remember\nwhich chalet it was we were staying in.\nThe next morning we were up bright\nand early. We had no choice really.\nThere were no curtains in the main\nroom and my bedroom shared a door\nwith the bathroom so when someone\ndecided to do their morning shave,\nshower and shi... I would be woken\nwith the sweet smell of a freshly laid\none or either Basti knocking his razor on the side of the bath like a wood\npecker on speed whilst he shaved his\nlegs!! He is a roadie though. What do\nyou expect?\nAfter a traditional French breakfast,\nPain au Chocolate and baguettes we\nspent the next couple hours building our bikes ready to start the weeks\nriding ahead all with the exception of\nNathan \u201cThe Beast\u201d. And what did the\nweight weenie learn? Never ever buy\ncarbon fibre parts for your bike even\nif you are a roadie because they break\nand then you are up shit creek without\na compatible head lock and will have\nto spend the rest of the week riding a\nrental bike that your gran would laugh\nat.\nAnd now a word from the lycra gang:\n\u2026Although Morzine is very popular\nfor DH and XC, there is plenty of space\nwith good roads for us roadies. As you\nmight expect, with it being the Alps it\nis pretty much up or down most of the\ntime, but there are a few flatter routes\nlike Thonon-les-Bains at Lake Geneva\ngives you fantastic scenery with rocks\nand wild waters as you cycle next to a\nriver on the D902.\nThe main purposes of going to Morzine are the Alps, as you probably expect where the easiest of climbs rival\nthe hardest hills in England. The Jeux\nPlane is just south of Morzine and\nyou have to climb for 10 km, ascending over 800 m to reach the top. The\nroads are nice and quite with little traffic compared to London. After a fabulous descent you can head to the Col\nde la Colombie. Riding the roads the\nTour de France passed two weeks earlier is just amazing. Although the Col\nde la Colombie is just rated category 1\n(4 being easy and 1 being soul destroy-ing), the climb is tough, especially the\nlast 3 km. Once you are at the summit\nit\u2019s an amazing feeling and you want to\nfeel the same pain and joy again. This\nclimb was the best riding experience\nof the whole holiday! Cycling around\nMorzine was an absolutely amazing\nfeeling and I want to do it definitely\nagain.\nThe downhill riding was excellent,\nsome of the best in the world. The\ntracks are generally very well maintained except for several pretty bad sections of braking bumps, but when you\nhave so many kilometres to maintain\nyou can be forgiven for several meters.\nLes Gets had a couple of the best areas with the bike park being great fun\nespecially jumping over the hut at the\nstart of the track and the 4X track also\nbeing another highlight in that valley.\nHaving the lift system is a godsend.\nEvery time you get to the top of a track\nrefreshed and raring for more you\nthink of the dark days of pushing up\nthe hills back in England. On two occasions we started our day at one end\nof the valleys in Les Gets and worked\nour way across the other valleys, going\nto the snow line height, and over the\nborder into Switzerland riding as many\ntrails as possible along the way. There\nis a great variety of tracks from very\nrooty, rocky and muddy technical stuff\nto fast speedway style courses that you\njust can\u2019t help but slide the back wheel\nout.\nWe were very lucky with the weather\nand had sun almost the whole time we\nwere there. The injury list was fairly\nshort and the week passed very quick-ly, with hundreds of kilometres ridden\nby everyone. Unfortunately Nathan\ndecided to blow his knee ligament after a couple of days, so he didn\u2019t get too\nmuch done between fixing his bike and\nbreaking his knee. Luckily there were\nno other major injuries except those to\nour egos and quite a few to our bikes.\nThe last night we went to our regular\nwatering hole and as usual things got\nmessy. Our resident Irishman showed\nus that \u201cjust cos I\u2019m Irish I\u2019m not an al-coholic! hick\u201d as he chatted up a couple\nof 14 year olds and The Beast earned\nhis name by transforming from a very\nwell behaved first year, into the incarnation of the devil. With the help of\nthe right mixture of spirits of course,\nnamely and Irish depth charge.\nLuckily our flight out wasn\u2019t till the\nafternoon so we had some time to recover before we had to leave. But not\nenough for some and flying with a hang\nover sucks. And finally another top\ntip for flying, don\u2019t put the following\nin your hand luggage: foot long spanner with a hook on the end, two part\naraldite in tubes, wheel skewers, screw\ndriver and penknife. People will not be\nhappy and \u201cbut I was hung over when I\npacked\u201d will not fly with the angry men\nin uniform.\n\u201cRiding the roads\nthe Tour de\nFrance passed\ntwo weeks\nearlier is just\namazing\u201d\nBasti on one of the scenic routes in the French Alps\nCycling in the Alps\nImperial College Cycling Club take a relaxing holiday in Morzine, France\nCharlie demonstrating his skills on a mountain bike whilst jumping over a hut\n\n"

    "content": "30 felix Friday 5 October 2007\nW\ne started off this\ntour in Britain,\nwhich is a good\nplace to start\n\u2013 personally I\nwould have been worried to wake\nup in any other country but the one\nI\u2019d fallen asleep in, especially given\ntoday\u2019s geopolitical wrangling. As a\ncollective, the whole of Sinfonietta\nhad decided that Britain was simply\ntoo cold, and that we desperately\nneeded cheaper alcohol than that\non offer in Britain, owing to the fact\nthat most of the orchestra had spent\ntheir student loans by the time tour\ncame round. So anyway, that is how I\nfound myself at Gatwick airport one\nThursday afternoon in June, Thursday 28th June 2007 to be precise.\nThe flight was uneventful, and we\nall landed safely to a quite a temperate climate. The advanced party\n(consisting of the supposedly more\nwise among the Sinfonietta great\nand good) had organised a bus for us\nfrom the airport to our accommodation for the week: the Villa Rasica.\nWe oohed all the way there \u2013 the\narchitecture of outer Dubrovnik is\nvery Mediterranean (as one choir\nmember informed me \u2013 he should,\nknow he has lived in Italy for a bit).\nWe arrived quite late, but naturally\nwent to the nearest bar as fast as\npossible and happily sampled \u00a31 per\nhalf litre of beer for as long as we could.\nThis turned out not to be very long as\nthe entire orchestra exhausted the capacity of this small watering hole and\nsoon all the draft beer was gone, later\nfollowed by bottled beer. It\u2019s not that\nany member of the orchestra has cultivated a particular ability to drink alco-hol; it\u2019s just that there were an awful lot\nof us. At around two we all drifted off\nto bed, as the dream of cheap alcohol\nwas shattered, much like most of the\nmusicians.\nThe next day we had a tour of Dubrovnik. Here some people may say\n\u201cnothing can ever possibly prepare you\nfor the architecture of Dubrovnik\u201d and\nother such hackneyed phrases, as if the\nbuildings were going to attack you \u2013\nand that you need specialised training\nin architectural defence. This may involve many hours of studied reading of\nart and design history, civil engineer-ing; and wandering urban spaces with\nexplosives to protect yourself, possibly\na bit of both. To be honest, if there ever\nwas a city to be unprepared for, Dubrovnik is probably it. From the marble\npolished paving stones that you walk\nround the city on, to the white gold\ngranite that most of the city\u2019s architecture is constructed from, Dubrovnik\nreally is the gem of the Adriatic.\nThe rest of the day was given over to\nexploring Dubrovnik ourselves (read:\ngoing to the beach), and then back to\nthe Villa Rasica for dinner. Then more\nbeach. Some of us had serious musical\ncommitments that evening \u2013 Imperial College Choir had their first rehearsal with the unique Collin Durant.\nThis was a big moment for the choir,\nthem being tour virgins. Yes! This was\nChoir\u2019s first tour in their 50 year his-tory. Apparently next year they want\nto go to Wales\u2026 But anyway, after\nliterally dragging most of the choir\nmembers from the beach, the villa\u2019s reception was soon filled with the deep\nthroaty sounds of the choir. The booming tenor sound of Ed Hughes was particularly prevalent (the very same man\nwho later won the tour award for being\nthe loudest member of tour).\nThat evening, Big Band played their\nfirst concert in the main square of\nDubrovnik, just in front of the church\nof St Blaise. This was a chance for\nmuch merriment, with a combination\nof dancing and loud music, many of\nthe other musicians being enthusiastic dancers. Afterwards we went to a\nbar on the old port and admired the\nview. More importantly this was the\nnight where our dear Chair Hilary\nWood displayed her amazing driving\nskills. The side entrance to the walled\ncity was made of arches in the classical Venetian style, and we had rented\na Luton van (complete with tail lift) to\ntransport instruments from the UK\nto Dubrovnik and around Dubrovnik\nitself. The problem did not present\nitself until Hil successfully negotiated\nthe van through the first two arches (a\njob which required millimetre preci-sion, due to the respective dimensions\nof the van and the arches). It was only\nthe next arch which proved impossible to negotiate the van through.\nMostly because the archway was far\ntoo small and the van was far too\nbig*. Then Hilary tried to reverse the\nvan back out the way she came. Only\nwhen she started this endeavour did\nshe realise that the level of precision\nrequired that the wing mirrors had to\nbe closed off. Also, Luton vans don\u2019t\nhave rear view mirrors. To cut a long\nstory short, it was a long and arduous\nten minutes whilst Hilary reversed the\nvan (seemingly by telepathy), and then\nMusic to\nthe ears of\nDubrovnik\nSinfonietta,\nBig Band and\nChoir Tour\ntook to town of\nDubrovnik for\ntheir summer\ntour. Tom Kealy\nreports\n\u201cIf there was\never a city to\nbe unprepared\nfor, Dubrovnik is\nprobably it.\u201d\n\n"

Only she\u2019s not so little\nanymore and it\u2019d be too easy to say the\ntheme of a vigilante is given the same\ntreatment here as Scorsese did in 1978.\nSo why do people insist on rating a film\nlike this only so far as how it compares\nto someone else\u2019s film 30 years ago?\nThe story focusses on Foster\u2019s char-acter, Erica Bain, a radio presenter\nwhose show is an ode to her home,\nNew York City, until she is brutally assaulted with her fiance in Central Park\nin a scene that is far more realistic and\nshocking than De Niro\u2019s shoot-out in\nTaxi Driver (the last comparison I\u2019ll\nmake on that score). Looking to regain\ncontrol of her life, she buys a gun and\ngets trigger happy, going beyond the\nlaw, here represented by police detective Terrence Howard, with her own\nbrand of justice. It all sounds a bit\ncomic book so far, no?\nWell, yes, and at times it does seem\nlike Jodie\u2019s next move will be to don\na cape and mask, but Neil Jordan has\nmore capable hands than those that\nmay let it descend into simple heroics.\nThe morality of the situation is the real\nquestion here and the film acts more as\ndebate than moral compass, and aims\nto provoke thought rather than supply\nanswers.\nThis is a film that concentrates on\nthe frustrations of society to live within\nthe law when it seems to impede jus-tice, a theme particularly relevant in\na political climate that sees those in\ncharge of the law causing international\ndebacles. Taxi Driver had Vietnam\nand The Brave One has Iraq, although\nthankfully only one reference is made\nto this throughout. The focus instead\nhere is the character, and that\u2019s where\nthe genius of Jodie comes in.\nHands up who hasn\u2019t been that impressed with Jodie Foster\u2019s role choices\nof late? Well, lower your hands again\nbecause this vehicle is exactly what she\ndoes best: vulnerable, but strong. Her\nJodie Foster returns to the screen in a role made for her, proving\nshe\u2019s still the thinking woman of Hollywood. And she kicks ass\neyes retain the emotion of the roles that\nmade her the most credible woman in\nHollywood and at turns reference the\nvictim of The Accused and the strength\nof Clarice in Silence of the Lambs, both\nof which bagged her an Oscar.\nJodie is simply fascinating to watch\nand the different sides to her seem\ncompletely believable throughout, if\nthe transitions themself could perhaps\nhave been handled better. The fdoes\nnot dent the film\u2019s enjoyability howev-er, even if you have to watch the early\nattack through parted fingers.\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nIt\u2019s all a matter of\nindividual tastes\nGood and bad taste are used so much\nin everyday context that it would seem\nlike somewhere there is a list of things\nthat fall into each category and cannot\nbe switched no matter how much we\nmay want dungarees to be good taste.\nBut who is the arbiter of taste these\ndays?\nThe truth is that the notion of taste\nitself should be rendered defunct. If\none person\u2019s treasure is another person\u2019s garbage, surely we should come\nround to the belief that everything has\nsomething going for it, and better to\nfocus in on that than whether or not\nsomeone\u2019s opinion is more justified\nthan somonene elses. But that\u2019s a bit\nidealistic, and the majority of us would\nsay that we hold opinion very dear to\nourselves.\nEveryone\u2019s a critic. It would be\nslightly pedantic if every time you professed an opinion on your favourite\nfilm or band you had to buffer it with\n\u201cbut that\u2019s just my opinion and I completely respect yours as well\u201d. A much\nmore common scenario would just be\na simple \u201cno, you\u2019re wrong, it was awful\u201d, when in fact right and wrong could\nbe no further removed from the issue\nin hand.\nWhat does, in reality, mke a film good\nor bad? Well, performances would be\none area where it is normally easy to\ndraw a line between the best and worst.\nI\u2019ve never met anyone who thought\nAndie MacDowell was going to run\naway with a clutch of awards for Four\nWeddings and a Funeral, for example.\nGenre? Well, you\u2019d be foolish to judge\nThe Shining on its comedy merits, so\nthe expectations that an audience has\nof a particular genre are definitely likely to factor into it somewhere, but this\ncan again vary, albeit not generally that\nmuch, between observers, Direction\nand plot are more subject to individual\nperception though and these are generally what makes or breaks films. And\nyet it is these factors that build the ivory towers of taste that leave some films\nsupposedly untouchable.\nSo what if you don\u2019t love The Godfather? No-one set it in stone that you\nhave to, and why shouldn\u2019t you get the\nchance to voice such an opinion over\nthe mass consensus? Justification for\nany point of view is all you need to\npresent a good argument, so if you have\nsomething that you\u2019d like to present in\nsuch a manner, then Felix can give you\nthe perfect platform.\nNow that you\u2019re had a chance to settle into the new academic year, whether you\u2019re a fresher or a returning stu-dent, you may feel that you want to do\nsomething that\u2019s not number juggling\nor algebra manipulation. If you have\na real passion for a classic film or alternatively you hate something that is\nseen as the holy grail of filmmaking,\nthen let us know.\nPerhaps you have a favourite director\nwho you feel is criminally overlooked,\nor perhaps you just want to rant for a\nfew hundred words about the worst\nsummer of cinema in years. Feel that\ncinema quality is decreasing rapidly\nwith nothing new coming in to compete with neverending sequels and the\nlike? Then be sure to get it off your\nchest and let the whole college know:\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClooney may be the star, but it\u2019s the great support that wins Clayton\u2019s case\nThe advertising of this film as little\nmore than an intelligent star vehicle for\nGeorge Clooney, Hollywood\u2019s recent\naddition to the can-do-no-wrong club,\nis grossly unfair. In fact, whilst lauded\nas Clooney\u2019s best performance of the\nyear/his life/the millenium, it seems to\nrather confirm the apparent truth that\nGeorge is most adept at playing the\nsame character repeatedly in slightly\ndifferent guises.\nGeorge Clooney has the misfortune of having one of those faces that\nis overly recognisable and difficult to\nmould into anything else, a feature\nalso present in his acting. Whether he\u2019s\nDanny Ocean, Batman or acting in one\nof his recent non-studio pics, he is so\nrecognisable as George Clooney that,\ndespite adding a slight self-uncertainty\nto his character profile here, it is hard\nto fully invest in him.\nClooney plays a fix-it man in the title role here as an employee of a law\nfirm whose basic job description is to\nget things done, but in this courtroom\n-thriller-without-the-courtroom, it is\nthe supporting players that show more\npromise. Tom WIlkinson is fantastic\nas the mentally ill lawyer who suffers\na crisis of conscience mid-case and\nsets the plot in motion, an Erin Brockovich-style tale if told from the point\nof view of the evil corporation\u2019s legal\nteam but with a bit more masculine action in place of Julia Roberts\u2019 childcare\nissues. As Wilkinson realises he is acting as agent for a company who have\npoisoned thousands of people with\ntheir product, Clooney is brought in\nto find out what he\u2019s up to and restore\nthe company\u2019s grip on the situation,\nwith various moral questions raised as\nAlex Casey\nThe Brave One \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: Neil Jordan\nWriters: Roderick Taylor, Bruce\nA.

The main\ncast is rounded off by Sydney Pollack\nwho oversees his law firm\u2019s operation\nfalling apart under his nose and in a\nrole that could have easily elicited the\naudience\u2019s moral outrage, he manages\nto achieve the appropriate hopelessness of his situation.\nThe plot itself does pick up towards\nthe end, but there is a lot of initial\ntwisting and turning that is hard to care\nabout, leaving the ending feeling like a\nslight relief. It\u2019s also another film that\nsuffers from the trailer which showcases all the best lines which within the\nmain body of the film carry much less\nimpact. Still, it\u2019s a hearty consolation to\nsee the Brits, Wilkinson and Swinton,\nsteal the limelight from the golden boy\n(man?) of the moment.\n\n"

    "content": "14 felix Friday 5 October 2007\nA starter\u2019s guide to BookCrossing\nFree books, but with a scavenger-hunt twist. Michael Cook has what you need to know to get started\nD\near Reader\u201d, the blurb\nbegins. \u201cI hope you enjoy\nthis book. I\u2019ve registered\nit on Bookcrossing.org\nso that I can keep track\nof where it travels and what people\nthought of it. You can log in online and\nleave your thoughts, before passing it\non to another reader.\u201d And that\u2019s about\nit.\nUnderneath,inhertrademarkspidery\nhandwriting, is the book\u2019s registration\ncode. It\u2019s Bookcrossing, summed up\nsimply, in its best and cleverest con-cepts. Free books. Sharing. Travel.\nWe read a lot of crap. There are a few\nreasons for this. Firstly, crap is cheap.\nCrap is 45p on a newsagent shelf, or a\n\u00a33.99 paperback sandwiched between\nmemoirs of page three girls and Z-List\nrugby players, and containing something bizarre about a loveless ex-po-liceman on the run to clear his name\nor something.\nReading crap is also fun, though \u2013 JK\nRowling was hardly TS Eliot, but her\nwriting was fun enough for people of\nall ages to read. But sometimes, we\nhave to avoid rubbish and go for something meatier. Something more enjoy-able. Not boring, necessarily, or three\ninches thick. But good.\nFortunately, this isn\u2019t too hard \u2013 for\ninstance, you pick up Felix and flick\nHow to Fossilise Your Hamster\nMick O\u2019Hare\nBrand new companion to the other\nNew Scientist bestsellers Does Anything Eat Wasps and Why Don\u2019t Penguin\u2019s Feet Freeze, this book contains a\nhuge assortment of experiments that\ncan be carried out with virtually noth-ing. Check out our coverage of the\nbook this issue.\nTravelling \u2013 Monday 8th October\nThe Ladies of Grace Adieu\nSusanna Clarke\nA collection of curious short stories\ncontaining, amongst other things,\nMary Queen of Scots, faeries, and very\nstrange owls. Grace Adieu is an entertaining collection of fairy-tale-esque\nstories that, whilst sometimes over-se-rious, are otherwise very enjoyable.\nTravelling \u2013 Tuesday 9th October\nOld Shite\u2019s Almanac\nA. Parody\nParody\u2019s work always seems to be trying too hard, but the Almanac\u2019s a pretty fun diversion \u2013 a tongue-in-cheek\ncollection of topical, not-so-topical,\nand essentially useless information\nabout the year just gone. Sometimes\nvery funny, sometimes not, but always\namusingly surreal.\nTravelling \u2013 Wednesday 10th October\nCrossing now\nimmediately to the Arts section,\nwhere you absorb their well-respected opinion on the\nlatest releases of the high\nsociety, and nod sagely at\nthe words of their attractive and well-endowed\neditors.\nThere are two things at play here,\nthat the founders of BookCrossing\nnoticed. Firstly, that people will read\nalmost anything if it\u2019s free. Secondly,\nthat sharing our opinion about books\nis great fun, for both the writer and the\nreader. After all, we\u2019re not doing Felix\nfor the paycheck.\nSo what if people just left books lying\naround for others to find? Giving books\naway for free is friendly, stops dusty\npiles of paper building up in the cor-ner, and adds a bit of excitement into\nthe day for those that find them. BookCrossing only marginally extended the\nidea of giving books away, by adding in\na secret ingredient. A massive game of\nhide-and-seek.\nIt\u2019s very simple \u2013 you sign up to\nBookCrossing.org and subscribe to\nwhatever regions you\u2019re near to. Kensington, for instance, is going to be easier for you to visit and pick up books\nin than somewhere in Oregon. Then,\nBookCrossing tells you when a book is\ngoing to be released in that area.\nIf you find the book (hints are left\non the website to help you), you read\nit, review it on the site, and pick another place to leave it in \u2013 which in\nturn notified everyone else subscribing to the area you\u2019re leaving it in. The\nbooks slowly travel the city, country or\nglobe, picking up opinions as they go\nand often creating stories about their\njourney.\nAnd if you find yourself with books\nyou no longer want to hold onto, it\u2019s\nComing soon\nThe Mission Song\nJohn Le Carr\u00e9\nOne of Carr\u00e9\u2019s latest novels, it has all\nthe intensity that you\u2019d expect from the\nex-Mi6 agent-turned-author. Bruno\nSalvador is a world-class interpreter\nthat\u2019s no stranger to doing clandestine work for the British Government.\nBut his latest assignment goes beyond\nwhat he is normally used to \u2013 identity\nchanges, shady corporate deals, and\nmysterious encounters with attractive\nnurses. Meaty, but good \u2013 for fans of\nThe Constant Gardener.\nGOD \u2013 Man\u2019s Loving Enemy\nAdam Bolton\nFelix Arts was given this by one of\nour Comment writers, but we\u2019ve been\ntold not to spoil the surprise of what\nit might be, so instead we\u2019ve got a joke\nfor you. A bear walks into a bar, and\ngoes up to the barman. \u201cI\u2019d like a Gin.\u201d\nThe barman begins to pour it, but the\nbear holds up a claw, and he stops.\n\u201cAnd tonic.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the big pause?\u201d the Barman says,\nand the bear shrugs, and replies, \u201cI was\nborn that way.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the way I tell \u2018em.\nDelete This At Your Peril\nBob Servant\nA great compilation of email correspondence to Internet spammers. Genuinely funny, and hopefully all true,\nFelix Arts will hopefully review this in\nthe near future.\nvery simple to start a journey your-self. Simply register the book with the\nsite and they\u2019ll give you a unique code\nand a little message to leave on the inside front cover (which we\u2019ve printed\nabove). Tell them where you\u2019re going\nto leave the book, and when you\u2019re\nroughly going to put it there, and just\nfollow the timing.\nMore often than not, the books are\ntaken but not registered. Because\nthey\u2019re more likely to be found by non-Bookcrossers, the idea of registering\ncan be quite daunting, and doesn\u2019t immediately appeal to the average reader.\nBut sometimes you\u2019ll be lucky, and\nstart off an entire chain of reviews as\na book travels from person to person\nand country to country.\nTake the friend who\u2019s given me my\nlatest BookCrossing book, for instance.\nHer profile has one particular book\nthat made nine journeys before coming\nto a rest. She gave it to a colleague in\nthe bookshop where she works \u2013 from\nher, to her sister. To her boyfriend. To\nsomeone he met in France. To another\nfriend \u2013 and each one of these left their\nmessages on the same web page, letting\nothers see where the book\u2019s been on its\ntravels.\nNot everything is so successful. A\nmonth ago, I left six books in a cafe.\nThey were all gone within a week, but\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\nnone of them were registered on the\nwebsite. But the messaging is just the\nicing on the philanthropic cake \u2013 free\nbooks were given, reading was done\nand a good time was had.\nNow, Felix gets a lot of books. We review some, put others in features, and\nmany we give away. This year, though,\nwe\u2019re going to BookCross them. They\u2019ll\nbe left at various places on campus or\nnearby landmarks (the Albert Memorial, or the museums for instance,\nwhich are popular with other local\nBookCrossers) and they\u2019ll all be registered on BookCrossing.org. That\u2019s free\nbooks, most of which are freshly pub-lished, ready to be picked up by willing\nreaders!\nWe\u2019ll post our releases in Felix as we\ndecide on them, but to get up-to-the-minute information on the releases\nyou\u2019ll need to sign up with the site. To\nsee what we\u2019re putting into the wild\nthis week, and what we\u2019re planning to\ngive away soon, check out the box on\nthe right.\nBookCrossing has a thriving community that share book reviews and\nstories of Crossing success, and while\nthe alerts system isn\u2019t always entirely\naccurate (we\u2019ve had a lot of alerts that\nwere three weeks late), there are a lot\nof releases in the Kensington area,\nranging from classic fiction to cook-books. It\u2019s a novel way to experience\nnew books, recycle old ones, and have\nyourself some very childish sort of fun\nwhilst doing it.\nIf you\u2019re BookCrossing in this area,\nget in touch with us and keep us informed about your releases \u2013 if we can,\nwe\u2019ll put them the paper alongside our\nown. If you\u2019re not BookCrossing, get\nstarted now. We\u2019ll be giving away a lot\nthis year, and it\u2019s the only way to get\nyour hands on it!\n\u201cBooks slowly\ntravel the country\nor globe, picking\nup opinions as\nthey go.\u201d\n\u201cBookCrossing is\nsimple. You find\nthe book, read it\nand review it on\nthe website\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "31\nFriday 5 October 2007 felix\nwe all cheered. Except those of us who\nweren\u2019t there, we cheered the next day\nwhen were told about it. This was quite\nan achievement nevertheless, and an\nexcellent lesson in deferred gratitude.\nSinfonietta and Choir had to wait a\nwhole day before their first concerts.\nThe orchestra had perhaps the most\nfun rehearsal of any of the ensembles\n\u2013 we rehearsed in Villa Rasica\u2019s garden,\ncomplete with strategic positioning of\nour violin sections around trees and\na horn section sitting on plastic toad-stools. The concert was once again in\nSt Blaise\u2019s square; which was perhaps\nnot ideal acoustically, mainly because\nthere wasn\u2019t an acoustic. Still the orchestra carried on, and we successfully\nmanaged to play some excerpts from\nTchaikovsky\u2019s Swan Lake, Kol Nidrei\nby Bruch (with soloist Gabriel Kan on\nthe cello, to whom we were grateful for\nremembering to come on tour, fortunately for us he always remembers to\nplay beautifully), and finally Sibelius\u2019s\nSymphony Number 1. Next, Choir serenaded us with their voices, including\na none to prudish rendition of Habanera from Carmen by Cecilia Bailey\namongst other favourites from their\nrepertoire of opera choruses, all very\nwell received.\nThe rest of the night was whiled\naway at a bar literally perched upon a\nrocky outcrop, discovered by chance\nand was simply the best bar this hack\nhad ever had the pleasure of drinking\nin. The next few days followed a similar\npattern, mostly spent wandering the\nstreets of Dubrovnik, having lunch in\nvarious restaurants (a note to vegetar-ians, eastern Europeans don\u2019t entirely\nunderstand the concept and will happily offer you nothing but cheese for\nyour entire stay. There really is too\nmuch of a good thing), and general\nmerriment in the direction of a moonbeam (including many post-midnight\nswimming trips, complete with skinny\ndipping from a certain member of the\nSinfonietta trumpet section).\nSunday being the day of rest saw most\nof the tour members in the cathedral in\nthe centre of Dubrovnik, presumably\nto atone for the sins of the previous few\ndays, but also to hear a wonderful collaboration between IC choir and Sinfonietta. We were playing (or singing)\nthe Requiem by Gabriel Faure. This\nwent along without hitch and much\npraise was given to the respective so-cieties, for the beautiful sounds that\nfilled the cathedral for forty minutes\nthat Sunday morning. The rest of that\nday was given over to relaxing, exploring and catching up with any sleep, lost\nnecessarily to the cause of tour fun.\nWe played another blazing concert in\nSt Blaise square on the Sunday night,\nthis time Prokofiev\u2019s Montagues and\nCapulets from his Romeo and Juliet\nsuite, and then Tchaikovsky\u2019s 5th sym-phony. There was no concerto, and we\nwould have to wait until Monday for\nShuang Wang to amaze us with her\npiano playing. One quite interesting\nevent did occur on the Sunday night,\none of the fresher cellists (one Tobias\nShaw) was seen consuming a large\namount of Croatian cherry brandy\nthroughout the night (and it was very\ngood). Later on he mysteriously disappeared from the company of the rest of\nthe orchestra, only to be found hours\nlater by his roommate quite happily\nasleep on the doorstep to his room.\nFor this, and many other misdemeanors Toby won the Julia Witton-Dauris\naward for services rendered to the alcohol industry, one of the most prestigious awards that could have been\nwon on this tour.\nWe had one last concert to play. This\nwas quite special, as it was in the Rector\u2019s Palace \u2013 the historic high seat of\nDubrovnik\u2019s government, now a place\nwherevariousimportantthingshappen\nand also home of the Dubrovnik Symphony Orchestra. It really was quite an\nhonour to be playing here. Most of the\npalace was a museum, including the\nplace where all the instruments were\nstored. Dan, our esteemed conductor,\ngave the stern warning that nothing\nwas to be touched in the palace, lest\nwe will be given a fee for repairs that\nwould take the remainder of our lives\nto repay. Given such a warning we naturally were on our best behavior, and\nsporting our snazziest concert gear\n(black jackets for the men). One interesting thing to note about the Rectors\nPalace \u2013 it had no roof, and was built\nout of stone. Thus the acoustic was one\nof the nicest I\u2019ve ever played in, as the\nbuilding had the acoustic of a church\nbut without the booming effect when\nbrass play really loudly. Thankfully the\nbrass sounds escaped through the roof,\nnice sounds though they were. The\nprogram for this night was to be: Wagner Introduction to Act III from The\nMastersingers of Nurenberg, followed\nby Grieg\u2019s Piano Concerto (played the\nimpossibly good Shuang Wang) and\nfinally Sibelius Symphony number 1.\nAll I can say is that this was simply the\nbest concert I have ever played in (and\nI\u2019ve done a few). Particular approval\nshould be given to Shuang who was in-credible, surpassing her performance\nwith Sinfonietta in London earlier this\nyear even. Of course this concert was\nwarmly received by the audience, with\nmany calls for extra bows. Suddenly it\nwas Go Go Gadget orchestra, as the\nband cleared up, loaded the van and set\noff for the bar in record time. Spirits\nwere high for this penultimate party,\nand party we did, late into the night.\nThe next day was given over to preparations for the chamber concert, and\nChoir and Big Band\u2019s last concerts. The\nchamber concert was up to the high\nstandards that preceded it on previous tours - once again a mixture of jazz\nand classical groups, it was lovely to\nhave the addition of some singers into\nthe mix this year. Alas, I have to say\nI missed this beginning of the Choir\nconcert as I was playing with my quartet in the chamber concert in the Old\nTown (Choir and Big Band were playing in the hotel Kompas, which overlooks the bay of Lapad and does a nice\npizza incidentally). I did not however\nmiss the rest of the night\u2019s partying\nand swimming. So much so, I almost\nmissed the boat trip to Lopud island\nthe next day. I must say that the trip\nto the island was most enjoyable, but\nI can\u2019t provide a detailed commentary\nbecause I was asleep under a sunshade\nfor most of the day. It was a necessary\nsacrifice to be made. You see we were\nleaving at 6am the following morn-ing, and there was no way I (or anyone\nelse for that matter) would be going to\nsleep before then.\nThat evening we had the tour dinner\nto attend to, which was an opportunity\nto reflect on the successes of the tour\nin the company of friends, new and\nold. Some comedy awards for various endeavors, including noise pro-duction, alcohol consumption and\nbeachwear in absentia as previously\ndiscussed were also presented. Then\nit was onto the beach for our final\nnight (all of it). Quite frankly, I don\u2019t\nreally remember what happened this\nnight \u2013 except that we drank the bar\ndry. It had offered to remain open\nuntil such time as we chose to leave,\nbut as of about 5 a.m. it closed with\nthe bar men gesticulating that there\nwere no drinks left to sell to us. Pity.\nThen we stayed up to watch the sun-rise, which is a beautiful thing when\nsitting on a beach with friends. Sadly\nthe tour came to end (emotionally at\nleast), we trekked back to the villa to\npack. My last memory of tour was\nsitting on the plane, taking off, and\nseeing the Adriatic spread below me\nas we tooked off into the still rising\nsun.\nThe combination of beautiful ar-chitecture, incredible weather (it\nwas 30 degrees for all of the tour),\nthe chilled out nightlife of Dubrovnik, and of course the company\nof friends, made for one of the most\nenjoyable experiences of my life so\nfar. I should thank everyone involved\nwith the organization of the tour \u2013\nwith so many societies involved, the\nlist is rather long to detail here and\nI think you know who you are, but\nSinfonietta\u2019s conductor and overall\ntour organiser Daniel Capps deserves a special mention for even\nthinking it was possible to bring 135\npeople on tour in the first place. Job\nwell done, all of you.\n*Hilary would like to contribute to\nthis review by adding that no Venetian archways or Lutons were injured\nduring this escapade, thus preserving a UNESCO world heritage site\nand Sinfonietta\u2019s bank balance.\nFrom top left to bottom\nright: the concert\nbanner hangs invitingly\nfrom the Old City walls,\nthe Choir Tour and the\nSinfonietta Strings,\neveryone playing in\nthe Old Town outside\nSt Blaise\u2019s Church, and\nlastly the Big Band\n\u201cSunday saw us\nin the cathedral\nto atone for the\nsins of previous\ndays\u201d\n\u201cWe had one last\nspecial concert\nto play \u2013 it was\nin the Rector\u2019s\nPalace.\u201d\n\n"

Geek\nMr. Nice can get all the girls\nPriya G\n\u201c\n...so I did\nthe socially\nrespectable thing\nand ignored his\nrequest until the\nbastard went\naway\n\u201d\nAskMen complains:\n\u201cThe modern man walks around on\neggshells, afraid of saying the \u201cwrong\nthing,\n\u201d scared of showing his natural\nsexual interest to a woman, scared of\nbeing scorned, humiliated, or even fired\n\u2013 scared of his own true self\u201d\nSo, women have made the \u201ceffeminate man\u201d when really they want the\n\u201creal man\u201d?\nI\u2019m afraid where me and AskMen\npart, is in our definitions of a \u201creal\nman\u201d.\nModern man isn\u2019t something different to \u201ca time lost\u201d when man was a\nconfident sexual being, protecting his\nhome, his woman and hunting.\nHe\u2019s as selfish, as testosterone filled,\nas emotional (or not) as any other man\nfrom any other decade.\nSure there might be a lot more bad\nchat up lines, bad dancing, increased\ncriticism, a faster paced lifestyle and\nan attitude to work over life. Work\nover marriage. Work over children.\nWork over anything else that exists in\nthis entire earth... but if you want to see\na real man, go and take a look at the\nmuch overlooked \u201cnice guy\u201d.\nBut you\u2019ll complain that the \u201cnice\nguy\u201d never gets the girl. So I\u2019ll tell you\nwhy:\nThe \u201cnice guy\u201d seems just too nice to\nbe ever bothered in the girl.\nThe \u201cnice guy\u201d never shows the\nslightest lusty interest in the girl.\nThe \u201cnice guy\u201d waits too long and\ndithers too much about telling the girl.\nThe \u201cnice guy\u201d finally plucks up the\ncourage when the girl has given up and\nhas gone for the... other guy.\nSo what\u2019s my definition of a \u201creal\nman\u201d?\nA man who will treat a girl right. A\nman who tries to understand. And he\u2019s\na man who cares and does something\n(underlined many times) to show this.\nIn one word: Action. It\u2019s that simple.\nThat\u2019s the only difference between the\nT\nhis week has been relatively quiet, in the world\nof A. Geek. A few com-plaints, the occasional lec-ture, the ever-encroaching\nshadow of Boris Johnson\u2019s magnificent\nrear end. One thing did get me though.\nA friend of mine \u2013 we\u2019ll call him E,\nbecause it has nothing to do with his\nname whatsoever \u2013 asked me to apply for a bank internship in his name.\nThink about that for a bit.\nNow, E isn\u2019t the sharpest nail in the\ncoffin of my sanity, but he\u2019s hardly a\nbastion of friendliness and co-opera-tion either, so I did the socially respectable thing and ignored his request religiously until the bastard went away.\nLittle did I know it was the Moneybags Conference Fortnight, sponsored\nby Two Short Planks, PLC; yes, that\ncheery time in the Imperial calendar\nwhere seventy percent of you admit\nyou couldn\u2019t give a monkey\u2019s toss about\nscience, and would rather have cloth\nsacks with dollar signs on thrown at\nyou to sit in front of Excel spreadsheets\nuntil the guy above you dies, or you\ncommit seppuku at the fruitlessness of\nit all. My money \u2013 and current national\nstatistics \u2013 are on the latter.\nNow, as you know, nothing makes\nme happier than idiot magnets, as it\nnot only increases the odds of a gas\nleak finally doing some good, but also\nallows me to avoid a higher proportion of fuckwits during the week than I\nmight normally do by simply not going\nto the Union.\nHowever, having so many companies leeching off of a college that is,\nfor some subjects at least, in the top\nten worldwide, raises some questions\nfor me. Most prominently, \u201cAre we\ncompletely screwed as a species, if\nour brightest minds are going to milk\nmoney out of Hong Kong all day?\u201d But\nalso secondary, more article-extending\nones, like \u201cWhat exactly are you looking to compensate for with a fifty thousand pound salary\u201d, or \u201cAre you looking\nforward to the 2011 currency crash\u201d,\nand my favourite, \u201cPlease just leave\nmy course right now, you shits\u201d which,\nwhile not actually being in the form of\na question, is probably the most pressing of all.\nI\u2019d say that I didn\u2019t know why you\nwere doing it, but that \u2013 like Goldman\nSachs\u2019 recruitment presentation \u2013\nwould be largely bullshit. You\u2019re doing\nit so you have a comedy-charity-dona-tion-cheque-sized pay packet to cover\nup any shreds of self-respect you may\nhave showing. That\u2019s fine. We all do\nthings that are a bit silly because of our\ncrippling sense of personal failure. For\ninstance, the other day I realised that\nno-one was taking me seriously, so I\ndecided to run for London Mayor. The\ndifference here is that, whilst I\u2019ll lose\nthe vote due to my tricky policy on Underground elevators (if someone is on\nthe left, and moving slower than you,\nyou\u2019re legally allowed to throw them\noff the side), the long-term effect is just\nthat I\u2019ve got a failed attempt to enter\npolitics on my Mi5 file. Whereas you\u2019re\nadding yet another five-foot seven collection of genitalia to Canary Wharf\u2019s\nalready massive pile of schlongs.\nAnd to you, obviously, this means\nvery little. Because you\u2019re only one\nperson, you\u2019ve only got one vote, you\u2019re\nonly driving one car (until Goldman\nSachs recruit you, naturally) and you\ncan only have one job. Why shouldn\u2019t\nyou get the best for yourself? That\u2019s\nwhat life\u2019s about, we do live in America, after all! And you\u2019ll probably buy\na wind farm, or adopt a small Ethiopian cow, or use energy-efficient paint\non your bedroom door and things like\nthat, and slowly become right-wing\nas you realise the government is taking most of your hard-earned\u2026 well\u2026\nearned cash. And that\u2019ll be that.\nOr is there something more to that\nlecture course you took on immunol-ogy? Is there some truth in what that\nPhD student told you about the importance of research? Sure, it seems boring now. And it\u2019s definitely very poorly\npaid. Plus, even if you escape Imperial,\nyou won\u2019t escape the feeling that every\nscientific institution has \u2013 that unsettling air of homework. And probably,\nthe idea of a moral duty to study rats\nin a laboratory somewhere is laughable to you.

Muscle? Lacking. Definition? Hardly. Need\nsome advice? Get to the gym.\nBut before you grab your belly tight\nNike Pros and run off to do some\nbench press, ask yourself do you really\nknow what you\u2019re doing? You could\nend up embarrassing yourself like an\ninexperienced lover taken to bed for\nthe first time. Or at the very least your\nmisplaced machismo may rub some\nseasoned vets the wrong way. If you\u2019ve\nnever been to a gym before (the toilet\nwhere you do your heavy lifting doesn\u2019t\ncount), then this simple guide is for\nyou.\nDO plan your gym session ahead of\narriving to the gym. You don\u2019t want to\nlook like a pansy as you figure out what\nexercise to do next. Have a plan, which\nmuscles, which exercises, how many\nsets, how many reps. If you need a\nhand there are always sample sessions\non this page.\nDON\u2019T get a big ego. Whether\nyou\u2019re a newbie or a professional, you\ncan always learn something new from\nanybody. I\u2019m always looking for new\nexercises, new training techniques to\nmaximise my efforts in the gym, and so\nshould you. Just because your muscles\nare getting bigger doesn\u2019t mean your\nhead has to also.\nDO keep hydrated. 2% drop in water\nis a 20% reduction in performance. You\ndo the maths. You may have to go to\nthe little boys room a little more but its\nworth it\u2019s worth it in the long run.\nDON\u2019T bring your entourage. Sure a\ntraining partner or two is a man\u2019s best\nfriend, but if you and your whole crew\ncome to the gym, no work is going to\nbe done! Save the socialising for the\nlibrary.\nDO ask for help. Being around some\nof the biggest guys in Imperial (a rare\nspecies indeed) may leave you in awe,\nbut don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help if you\ndon\u2019t know what your doing. Big guys\nhave big hearts and we all love to help\nthe new breed, just don\u2019t drool over the\nbiceps.\nDON\u2019T show lift. By this I mean lift\nweights that you can\u2019t do a single rep\nof, just to look cool. Other than injuring yourself and occupying weights out\nof your league, you\u2019re going to look like\na prick.\nDO push yourself. In fact always\npush yourself; if you don\u2019t then there\nare plenty of museums around campus\nto occupy your time.\nDON\u2019T think the gym is your house:\nclean up your mess. Don\u2019t just toss\nweights to the side like a cheap hooker\nwhen you\u2019re done with them. Pack that\nshit up!\nDO enjoy the experience, without it\nyour not going to want come back anytime soon.\nThey are not the biggest muscles in\nyour body, nor are they the most pow-erful. The size of these bad boys may\nnot even give you an advantage in you\ndaily activities. But the biceps will,\nand always will be a showpiece mus-cle. A statement, as if to say, \u201cDon\u2019t\nworry guys, I\u2019m fully loaded\u201d. So come\nsummer time, if you want to rock the\nsleeveless vest and open up your own\ngun show, you may want to build up\nyour artillery now.\nThis session will give your biceps\nthe most intense work out, leaving\nthem feeling burned out, weak, used\nand abused. But embrace the feeling\nbecause with proper nutrition they\nwill grow back, and boy will they grow\nback. Now you can ditch the peashoot-ers and pick up the twin Uzis.\nThe preacher curls are essential for\na good work out for the long head of\nthe bicep muscle. Using dumbbells,\nrest your arm on a bench and curl the\nweight stretching the muscle as far as\nit can go, as in the picture. Use your\nother arm to give it a slight spot if you\nneed it.\nThe \u2018finisher\u2019 for biceps is rope curls.\nUsing the rope attachment to the cable machine set the cable to the lowest\nsetting and curl the rope. Remember\nto keep good form- a straight back,\nknees slightly bent, elbows back and\nyour biceps doing all the work. Start at\na weight which you can curl for 8 reps,\nthen lower the weight setting and start\nagain, then again, and again. Do it until\nyou can\u2019t physically move those arms.\nThen say hello to your little friends.\nFelix takes no responsibility if you\nbreak yourself in half whilst trying\nto lift weights that are clearly too\nheavy for you.

Or perhaps you just want to trim down those\nbingo wings or fill out your shirt sleeves\na bit more? Well hopefully you\u2019ll have\ngot an introduction at Ethos giving you\nan idea of what to actually do in the\ngym, but what do you do afterwards?\nThat may sound like a dumb question\nas the answer is obviously work/ Halo\n3/ pub/ etc\u2026\nBut that is not the answer. At least\nit is not if you want to get the best results from your hard work. So what is?\nWell pay attention know as I am about\nto let you in on what is the single most\npowerful toning, muscle building and\nfat loss tool there is\u2026the Post Workout\nMeal (PWM).\nWhen you lift weights you are damaging your muscle tissue. That\u2019s right,\nyou\u2019re damaging your muscle in the\ngym. You build your muscle when\nyou\u2019re outside the gym. When you finish your workout your muscles will be\ncrying out for raw materials to repair\nthemselves and get stronger. The PWM\nis meant to give your muscles all the\nmaterials needed to rebuild your muscle as fast and as strong as possible.\nSo what should and should not be in\nthe meal? The first thing is protein, as\nit is protein that will provide the building blocks for new muscle tissue. The\nnext ingredient is carbohydrates as this\nwill provide the fuel to power the muscle repair process. The PWM should\nnot contain fat of any kind as fat will\nslow down the absorption of the protein and carbohydrates. I\u2019m certainly\nnot saying fats are bad as you\u2019re body\nneeds them, and some fats can be very\ngood for you. But fats just do not have\na place in a PWM.\nI my opinion the best form of PWM\nwould be a protein shake made with\nwhey protein and any sugary drink e.g.\nCoke, orange juice, etc\u2026 (Sorry, beer\nand snakebites don\u2019t count). That\u2019s\nright, it is not only ok to have processed sugary drinks after a workout, it\nis actually a very good idea. The sugar\nwill get straight into you\u2019re blood and\nup your blood sugar levels. This will\ncause a release of insulin which will\ndrive nutrients (i.e. sugar and protein)\ninto your muscle cells. Don\u2019t worry,\nthis is probably the one time of any day\nthat eating sugar will not make you put\non fat. The best protein to consume is\npowdered whey protein (mixed with\nwater into a shake) as this type of protein will be rapidly absorbed into your\nbloodstream and will start the recovery process of your muscles ASAP.\nWhat\u2019s that you say? You don\u2019t want\nto spend your beer money on expensive protein shakes? Well, fortunately\nfor you cheapskates Nature (in conjunction with your local supermarket)\nhas provided you with a cheap substitute that is actually pretty damned ef-fective: Skimmed Milk. It has simple\neasy to absorb proteins in it (the whey\nprotein in those expensive shakes are\nextracted from milk) along with some\nsugar in a pretty good protein:carb\nratio for building muscle. But you\u2019ll\nneed to drink 750ml or more of it (you\nshould aim to get 25grams of protein\nor more in your PWM).\nBut why would you eat after a workout if you\u2019re trying to lose weight?\nThere are two main reasons. Firstly,\nit\u2019ll encourage your body to build more\nmuscle. Building muscle requires a\nhuge amount of calories and your body\nwill use your fat stores to meet some\nof that energy requirement. With cardiovascular exercise (e.g. running)\nyou stop burning extra calories when\nyou stop the exercise. When you stop\nweight lifting you keep burning extra\ncalories for days as your body rebuilds\nyour muscles. Secondly, if you work\nout hard your body will typically start\nto release cortisol after 40 minutes\nor so. Cortisol (sometimes called the\n\u2018stress hormone\u2019) encourages the continued break down of muscle tissue for\nenergy and the storage of fat in your\nfat cells. The PWM will shut down the\nrelease of cortisol (good) and promote\nthe production of testosterone by your\nbody (also good).\nSo work hard in the gym, but don\u2019t\nsell yourself short by missing out on a\nPWM. It will become one of the most\nimportant tools in your fitness toolkit.\nWhat Mr. Muscle forgot to tell you last time...\nAlex Fergusson\nAlexander Fergusson educates us all on the other side of working out in the gym, the Post Workout Meal\nEditors note: I\u2019m sure Mr. Muscle\nwill have a reply for this next week\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 5 October 2007 felix\nArts\nA soundtrack to die for in Parade\nA guilt-free musical with all of the flavour and none of the calories? Caz Knight is pleasantly surprised\nParade, a musical based on the book by\nAldred Uhry, had all the odds stacked\nagainst it for a good review. Not only\nwas it being seen and reviewed by one\nwho cares not for (the often cultural\nabsence in many) musicals, but the\nplot seemed one of far too sombre and\nheavy a topic to be presented with musical accompaniment.\nParade follows the story of the Leo\nFrank case, one of the most closely\nfollowed in its time, incurring much\n\u2018yellow journalism\u2019 along the way. Set\nin 1913 Atlanta, Georgia, Frank is\nvery much a fish out of water living\nin the South whilst being Jewish and\nIvy-league educated. Superintendent\nof a pencil factory, Frank is given the\ndeath sentence after being convicted\nof the murder of little Mary Phegan\nwho worked for pennies at his factory.\nFrank\u2019s case carries on long after his\nincarceration with an appeal to change\nhis sentence after much effort on his\nwife, Lucille, and eventually the Georgian governor\u2019s part. In history, the upshot is a life sentence in lieu of hang-ing. However, Parade gives us a much\nmore grizzly ending.\nBertie Carvel carried out the role of\nFrank stupendously. His character as\nthe neurotic, highly strung and snooty\nfactory owner, complete with mannerisms that were maintained throughout,\nwas superb and utterly convincing. We\nare drawn into Leo\u2019s turmoil as we feel\nimmense pity for him. This pity turns\ninto elation as Leo\u2019s stress develops\ninto happiness and a rekindled love\nwith Lucille. Carvel\u2019s voice is easily one\nof the best and he exhibits great talent during the dance scenes (of which\nthere are disappointingly too few).\nShaun Escoffery deserves a special\nmention as the character of Negro Jim\nConley, allegedly in the factory at the\ntime of the crime. A huge contrast to\nLeo in disposition, Jim testifies against\nhim in the case. Not just a pretty face\nand well-structured physique, Escoffery has an outstanding voice and portrays the charismatic Jim with ease.\nExceptional casting with regards to\nmurder victim Mary Phegan; the actress\u2019s blonde pig-tailed hair, blue eyes\nand doll face eerily reminds us of little\nMaddie Mac.\nThe introductory song of Parade is\nperformed by one of the best, in my\nopinion, voices of the cast. Stuart Matthew Price blows us away and has our\nneck hair standing and does a good job\nof the three roles he takes on. Although\nseveral actors have been singled out,\nthe cast was brilliant; their energy and\nenthusiasm really makes the show.\nBeing one who considers most musicals with disdain, it is a credit to the\ncalibre of the music if I was left wanting Parade\u2019s soundtrack for my own\nlistening pleasure at home. The music\nand songs clearly dominate the production but the continuity between\nsongs, scenes and even moods is seam-less. The music ranges from uplifting\nmelodies to ones of sadness and ones\nof great power. Amongst the show\nwere songs of beauty that had me on\nthe brink of tears on several occasions\n(rather embarrassing as I am not aware\nof the rules on crying in theatre!). Of\nParade\u2019s thirty odd songs there were\nvery few I disliked.\nThe whole package is completely\nuncheesey (as in the case of some of\nthe more \u201ccommercial\u201d musicals). It is\na musical with depth or grown up mu-sical, but with none of the fun or entertainment value extracted. The gravity\nof Parade\u2019s subject matter is eased by\nthe musical element but in no way detracts from this portrayal of the Frank\ncase - a key event in U.S. legal history.\nThe play even adds a slightly macabre\nshock factor. The recreated hanging\nin the play is extremely convincing\nand reminds one of recent events in\nBath, during the Jane Austen festival,\nwhere the public expressed disgust at\nthe highly realistic mock gallows in the\ntown\u2019s centre.\nThis musical gives us something to\ncover every emotion: love, sadness,\nanger, injustice, mystery, humour and\nabove all it gives us an awesome and\nhighly memorable night out served\nup in a small, but infinitely more intimate setting than perhaps some of the\nlarger theatres. And it has converted a\nmusical-hater. To miss out would be\nfoolish.\nParade is that rare creature \u2013 an enthralling musical that manages to incorporate a thrilling soundtrack with a stunning emotional gravitas\n\n"

One of the oldest institutes and galleries in London, don\u2019t let the Royal Academy\u2019s rarefied image put\nyou off - it regularly plays host to excellent world-class exhibitions of painting, sculpture and antiques. Currently showing is a retrospective of the German artist George Baselitz, spanning his early days to the period of\nmotif-heavy and \u201cupside-down\u201d paintings for which he became renowned. The academy only relatively recently\nrecognised enfant terrible Tracy Emin\u2019s work, introducing the likely notion that this instituion is finally becoming\nmore open minded. Burlington house is located across the road from the station, under the arches - just look for\nthe red flags.\nTate Britain, Millbank\nThis underrated space on the north bank of the Thames houses the national collection from the\n16th century onwards, with works by masters such as Constable, Gainsborough and William\nBlake alongside more contemporary upstarts (it houses the finalists from the annual Turner\nPrize). It displays a diverse array of British art from Hockney to Howard Hodgkin to Brian\nHawe\u2019s display in Parliament Square.\nTalks and events are regularly held here and every first Friday of the month sees Late at Tate,\nwith performances from live bands and the clink of glassware chiming through its sweeping\ncorridors. It also houses a monumental display of works by Turner, bequeathed by the artist to\nthe nation as a parting gift - an explosion of colour worth the trip to Pimlico alone. The museum\nis located around the corner from Pimlico station - just follow the signs.\nNational Gallery and National\nPortrait Gallery, Trafalgar Square\nProbably the most-visited gallery in the capital, the National Gallery is a powerhouse of Western European Art, running the gamut from Impressionism and Da Vinci, Rembrandt to Van Gogh, Turner and Degas...the list continues almost infinitely. To venture here would require at least an afternoon and to brave\nthe carnage of central London - not to mention the masses of tourists than find their way here - but the\ngallery is more than an appropriate slice of the capital\u2019s cultural wealth. Immediately adjacent on Charing\nCross Road is the National Portrait Gallery, showcasing past masters and some of the best contemporary\nportrait photography in London; though it\u2019s larger sibling is far too large for a quick look, the National\nPortrait Gallery is a welcome interlude to the rush of the West End.\nChapter Two \u2013 Galleries\n\n"

That\u2019s it for my extremely boring editorial this week, just\nmake sure you enjoy the remainder of\nfreshers events happening at the Union\nand around London\nThe Mingle. We\u2019re going to\nneed a montage. Ooh it takes\na montage. Hellamashup\nThe first event of the year at the Union. Felix went to corrupt the freshers, drink the\ncheap booze and got right up there in Peaches Geldof\u2019s face with the telephoto lens\nGregory Mead\n22\nnightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix Friday 5 October 2007\nNightlife\nNightlife Editor \u2013 Greg Mead\nSo, you\u2019ve just travelled 500 miles with\nall your Godly possessions, for the last\nten hours you\u2019ve been fretting about\nfinding your new halls of residence,\ngetting your room, unpacking all your\nboxes, and more importantly, trying\nto get rid of your parents. It\u2019s the first\nand probably most stressful day of your\nuniversity career, so what better way to\ncomplete it but to go an all night hella\nmashup that was The Mingle at The\nUnion on Saturday night.\nHaving been to numerous\nUnion events over the last three years,\nwe weren\u2019t expecting anything like\nwhat greeted us on entering.\nGlowstick wielding nu-rave-hoodie wearing teenagers jumping\naround to the sounds of Daft Punk and\nLCD Soundsystem was not the first\nthing that crossed my mind when trying to imagine what this night was going to turn out like, but that\u2019s what was\nhappening in the large marquee in Beit\nQuad almost the entire night.\nThe Mingle was reserved for freshers,\nso almost everybody there was either\na first year or a hall reap/sub-warden,\nand it showed. Pitchers of snakebite\nand rivers of beer meant that all but\nthe most ultra reserved students were\npartying like it\u2019s 1999. The atmosphere\nwas infinitely better than I\u2019d expected\nand I almost felt as carefree as one of\nthem jumping up and down in a giant\ncircle on the dance floor singing along\nto \u2018Smells Like Teen Spirit\u2019\nThe night featured two rooms. DB\u2019s\nwas hosted by Adventures In The Beetroot Fields, who host a regular alternative night at Fabric in Farringdon, for\nwhich we have written numerous good\nreviews in the past. The bands were\ngood too, and made a change from listening to mediocre student bands who\nlook totally out of place at such a large\nevent. Look out for upcoming gigs in\nvery well established clubnights such\nas DURRR and White Heat from all the\nbands that played on Saturday.\nFor me, the large marquee in Beit\nQuad was the main attraction of the\nnight. Electro and Indie hits blared\nfrom the DJ booth to a packed crowd\nof revellers. This was the first time I\nhave ever witnessed a crowd surfer at\nImperial College Union, so that should\ngive you an idea of what was going on.\nPeaches Geldoff was the guest DJ, for\nthe night, and to be honest I think the\ngirl playing before and after her was\nconsiderably better. She can\u2019t mix and\nchose a stupid selection of cheese hits\nthat seemed to dull the dance floor at\nwhat should have been peak time, although in conclusion, I think this was\nthe best Union event I\u2019ve ever been to,\nso we\u2019ll have to see if the Freshers Ball\n2007 on Friday turns out to be as suc-cessful. Incidently, email in if you see\nyourself in the pictures to win a prize.\nAre you in these photos?\nEmail in to win two tickets to Fabric\nCompetitions\nIt\u2019s still not too late to win last\nweek\u2019s prizes. We have:\nTwo Fabric double passes for\n24th, 25th and 26th October.\nTwo tickets for The End for\nLaylo & Bushwaka on 6th October, and copies of both their\nalbums which they will be releasing on the night.\nThree double passes for Turnmills at their Halloween special\non 27th October.\nEmail:\nnightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

They weren\u2019t the only things moving-in that weekend\nThe new intake of freshers arrived at\nImperial on Saturday, however, even\nthough the majority of the students\nwould be paying over \u00a3150 per week,\nmany moved into unfinished rooms.\nCollege recognised this was unacceptable and soon announced it would be\ngiving Southside residents a 25% discount on their first month\u2019s rent.\nJust a few days after Felix\u2019s guided\ntour of Falmouth-Keogh \u2013 one of the\nthree halls within Southside \u2013 it became apparent there was plenty yet to\nbe completed compared to what was\non show before the freshers moved\nin. Despite builders and cleaners scurrying about on the day of Felix\u2019s tour,\nevery room in Falmouth-Keogh appeared to be in working order.\nAt the time, it was known that the\nsocial room would be incomplete when\nthe freshers arrived, and Felix was also\ntold that there was work still to be\ndone on the kitchens, along with general cleaning in and around the halls.\nFelix was unable to gain access to\nthe other two halls on the day, namely\nSelkirk and Tizard, and since residents\nhave moved in it has become apparent\nthat these halls were still several days\nfrom completion.\nIn the early hours of Saturday morn-ing, College staff were still working to\nget the halls ready. The situation was\nso dire that College staff were joined\nby kind-hearted students who volunteered to help.\nSome kitchens were full of tables\nstacked on top of each other and chairs\nwrapped in protective plastic. Lamps,\ntoilet fittings and other items sat\nboxed and dormant in the corridors.\nThe builders\u2019 tools were still lying in\nvarious rooms and some bedrooms\neven had plastic sheeting covering the\nwindows because the curtains hadn\u2019t\nturned up. To add to College\u2019s woes,\nthe lift in Falmouth-Keogh which was\nworking perfectly well during Felix\u2019s\ntour subsequently broke down.\nCollege recognised the shambles that\nmany new students would be moving\ninto and issued residents with a 25%\ndiscount for their first month. This\ncomes on top of the \u00a35 per week discount that some residents will be getting if they are housed in rooms with\na view of the Eastside builders\u2019 porta-cabins. Incidentally, since last week\u2019s\ntour, College has covered the portac-abins with a giant dark blue and green,\nleafy cover.\nThe ongoing works being finished on\nSouthside seem to have had differing\neffects on students. Many were so overwhelmed with actually starting university they didn\u2019t seem bothered with the\nongoing work. Others have expressed\ndismay at moving into an unfinished\nroom, such as student, Azfarul Islam,\nwho said he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d that his\nroom is without an internet connection still, something that would come\nin quite handy to use when it comes to\ndoing some work.\nThe lift in Falmouth-Keogh is working again however and Southside\nshould be finished in its entirety during October.\nHow did moving into halls go\nfor you? Did any problems arise?\nAre you satisfied with your hall\nof residence? Felix is going to be\ninterviewing freshers soon. Email\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk if you want\nto be heard. One of the over subscribed, luxury en-suite, deluxe, premium rooms\nLIVE.CGCU.NET\nBBC interviews\nIC students over\nOyster debacle\nOn Tuesday afternoon, mid-way\nthrough Freshers\u2019 Fair, one of the BBC\u2019s\noutside broadcast teams came to Imperial to interview students, whose\nStudent Oyster cards had ceased to\ngive them discount rates, live on BBC\nLondon News.\nLive! Editor Ashley Brown and last\nyear\u2019s Deputy President (Graduate\nStudents), Shama Rahman were interviewed and asked to talk about the\nbroken and frustrating system for registering for a student Oyster cards.\nThe Transport for London (TfL)\nwebsite has been heavily criticised this\nweek, after many students have been\nleft with no option other than to pay\nfull fares on the tube because the registration system was full of bugs and\ncrashed often, leaving them unable to\nrenew their student Oyster cards.\nThe BBC became aware of the complaints after a 12 month-old comment\nthread on the Live! website became\nactive once again. Dismayed Student\nOyster card users were complaining\nof a range of problems including being\novercharged, being charged twice and\nbeing totally unable to get hold of an\nofficial application form.\nSince the BBC ran the story, TfL has\nreleased an apology, commenting that\nit is \u201cworking hard to urgently resolve\u201d\nthe problems.\nIf you are having difficulties with\nyour Student Oyster card, or you can\u2019t\nget hold of one at all, TfL recommends\nthat you contact them during off-peak\nhours. Their ears are ready for a verbal\nbattering before 10am and after 4pm.\nAshley Brown cradles a giant invisible hotdog during his interview\nGordon Brown spent time at Imperial\u2019s\nSouth Kensington campus on Wednesday in his first visit to a UK university\nsince becoming Prime Minister in\nJune.\nThe PM, accompanied by Professor of Surgery Lord Darzi and Rector\nSir Richard Sykes, toured the newly\nformed Institute of Biomedical Engineering in its second high-profile\nvisit recently after being opened by the\nQueen earlier this year.\nLord Darzi was Chair of Surgery\nat Imperial until he was recently appointed as Parliamentary Undersecretary for the Department of Health by\nGordon Brown, and pioneered the use\nof robotics and virtual operations in\nminimally invasive surgery which was\nat the centre of the visit.\nThe stopover is timed to coincide\nwith Monday\u2019s launch of the merger of\nImperial College Faculty of Medicine\nPrime Minister visits IC\nAndrew Somerville\nNews Editor\nBrown comes to College supporting the creation of the IC\nHealthcare NHS Trust which launched on the first day of term\nand two highly regarded NHS trusts: St\nMary\u2019s and Hammersmith Hospitals.\nThe resulting \u201cImperial College\nHealthcare NHS Trust (ICHNHST)\nwill be the UK\u2019s biggest, incorporating\nfive hospitals: Hammersmith, Charing\nCross, St Mary\u2019s, Queen Charlotte\u2019s &\nChelsea, and the Western Eye.\nThe merger will also create the first\nAcademic Health Science Centre\nin the country, aimed at integrating\nhealthcare services with state-of-the-art medical teaching and research. According to current estimates, the trust\nwill have a turnover of over \u00a3750m and\nexpects to treat one million patients a\nyear, and will be managed by current\nPrincipal of the Faculty of Medicine of\nImperial College, Prof. Stephen Smith.\nOrchestrating this merger and creation of the ambitious new centre of\nmedical excellence was one of Lord\nDarzi\u2019s first duties as Undersecretary,\nand his appointment was the first in a\nrapid succession of governmental positions given to senior Imperial staff.\nLast week Deputy Rector Prof. Sir\nLeszek Borysiewicz was announced\nas Chief Executive of the UK Medical\nResearch Council (controlling an annual research budget of \u00a3460m), and\non Monday Prof. John Beddington\nwas named as Sir David King\u2019s successor as Chief Scientific Adviser to the\nGovernment.\nThis string of appointments and\nmergers cements Imperial\u2019s position\nat the heart of governmental scientific research, especially in medicine,\nbut comes at a time when government\npolicy in the Department of Health is\nincreasingly under fire over issues including rising Private Finance Initiative\n(PFI) costs and rock-bottom morale\nwithin the NHS. Lord Darzi currently\nhas the difficult task of convincing\ndoctors that such high-profile NHS\ndecisions will in fact improve healthcare services, whilst facing a medical\nclimate of cynicism and desperation\nover the perceived privatisation of the\nNHS.\nArtist\u2019s impression of the NHS merger. He/She\u2019s apparently a little too literal\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nVITALI LAZURENKO\n\n"

He doesn\u2019t\nbelieve you\u2019re having a good time unless your retinas are being scorched by\nexplosions and your hands are shaking\nfrom an overdose of adrenaline.\nHailing from the wartorn (hyper-bole in progress) realm of Bangladesh,\nAzfarul is the console aficionado and\nall-round nice guy. He\u2019s on the artsy,\nhippie side of games and thinks that\nengrossing, poignant narratives and\natmospheric design are de rigueur.\nTogether,welookforwardtopresenting to you the multi-faceted aspects of\nthe gaming world and hopefully work\nup enough courage in you to tell your\nfriends that you\u2019d rather not go to the\npub tonight since you\u2019re in the middle\nof a rather exciting section of BioShock.\nBut it\u2019s not all sad solo outings because\ngaming is a social beast at the best of\ntimes: Halo parties, CS shootouts and\nPES tourneys abound; we\u2019re here to\nhave fun and rock your world!\nOr, you know, mildly amuse you at\nthe very least.\nCheers,\nAz & Sebb.\nThis\nWeek\nN Okami Ye Olde School\nFreshers\u2019 Videogames 101\nAzfarul Islam thinks that you should join others in huddling around a warm screen\nW\nhile I\u2019m sure that all\nof you have had a\nfun time settling in,\nmakingnewfriends\nand generally being\nbudding little socialites,\nit\u2019s time to remember\nthat you\u2019re at Imperial. So\ngive in, embrace the geek\nwithin.\nA great way to get a\nwhole common room\nor kitchen involved in a\nbit of fun is starting up a\nround of multiplayer gaming \u2013 be it on\nconsoles or fancy-shmancy PeeCees.\nHere are a few classic suggestions to\nbreak the pixelated ice with.\nPro Evolution Soccer (PS2, PC,\nXbox)\nSports are always a great way to invigorate yourself creatively, physically and\nsocially; the game iterations only conform to the latter but hey, they\u2019re fun.\nThe best of the bunch is PES. Why does\nit work? Nobody really knows. Perhaps\nit\u2019s simply because it does. It\u2019s really a\nno-frills entertainment package with\nfluid gameplay, organic controls and\na balance that captures the impetuous\nnature of the beautiful game. Yeah, so\nit hardly has the correct player names\n(licensing issues) and maybe the graphics lack pizzazz\u2026 but try telling that to\nthe millions that boycott FIFA.\nCounterStrike (PC)\nA supreme fa-vourite, particularly among\nthe oriental Asian\ncommunity, CS is\na realistic game-mod turned full\ntitle that continues to offer hours\nof entertainment.\nThe emphasis on team-based tactics\nand the mayfly lives of the players\nmeans that battles can springboard\nastonishingly quickly between painstaking stratagems and all-out carnage.\nWhat truly propels this title is the\nabundance of mods lovingly built by\nthe players themselves. If you\u2019re a nov-ice, prepare to die... a lot... but have a\ngreat time in doing so.\nSuper Smash Brothers Melee\n(GameCube)\nHere\u2019s a title that takes famous (game)\ncharacters, intuitive play mechanics\nand a multitude of features and then\ncreates an all-out fighting experience\nthat can appeal to anyone regardless of\nage or gender. It\u2019s pure and simple fun\nsolidified into disc form and done so\nwith tenacity. You can tweak battles to\nyour heart\u2019s content\nand whittle away\nthe night with ease.\nReal-time Pok\u00e9mon\nbrawls for the win,\nindeed.\nHalo\n(Xbox,\nXbox\n360)\nThere\u2019s\nreally nothing about Halo that I haven\u2019t\nalready said! It\u2019s quite an exhilarating\ngameplay experience that succeeds\nthanks to fine-tuned controls, addicting map design and by simply being a\nblast to play. There\u2019s something about\nit that makes the carnage quite gratify-ing; the balance is pitch perfect, allowing players of most skill levels to enjoy\nright from the beginning. Given the\nplethora of interesting weapons and\nintuitive vehicles, it\u2019s easy to see why\nthe series offers such a comprehensive\ngaming package.\nWii Sports (Wii)\nFace it: we all love the Wii! Being able\nto channel all that pent up adrenaline\ninto actual gameplay motion was a brilliant stroke in itself and then applying\nthat synergy into sports games pretty\nmuch seals the deal. Wii\nSports boasts five major\nactivities: tennis, bowling,\nbaseball, golf and boxing.\nThe competition can get\nfierce with gamers amazingly breaking a sweat and\nthe chances of physical\nharm actually exist; it\u2019s a\nvery intense, addicting experience that will have you hooked and\nyou will want to play the next round...\nand the next round... and the next one\nto settle scores. Nexties? Not a chance.\nGairaigo Episode 1: Okami\nGairaigo is a Japanese loan-word that\nconveniently means \u201cloan-word\u201d (see\nwhat I did there?). This section is designed to whet your appetite for the oft\nrefreshing, truly wondrous and highly\nbizarre world of Japanese games. This\ngoes beyond conventional titles and\nlooks at a quaint little world where you\nillustrate heavenly changes upon the\nsecular and realise that you\u2019re a forty-five year old trapped in the body of a\nteenager. It\u2019s a mad world, after all.\nOkami\nOkami is a novel concept that perspica-ciously attempts to fuel the \u201cgames are\nart\u201d debate by thrusting a paintbrush\ninto your hand (or paw) and pleading that you purge the world of evil by\npainting a fresh coat of kaleidoscopic\nbeauty over it. Oh, and you also play\nas a Sun deity trapped in the corporeal\nform of a white wolf.\nI suppose you\u2019re rolling your eyes\nwith a great deal of askance right\nabout now, and rightfully so. The concept seems a little too pastoral to offer\na spontaneous gaming experience but\nyou\u2019re about half-right. The aim of the\ngame is to really revel in the saturated\nhues of the world. You\u2019ll explore stunning locations that are designed with\ndelicate nuance and face off against\ncreatures that are so creative and ba-roque, you can\u2019t decide whether to\nattack or admire them. The painting\naspect permeates into every facet of\ndesign and brilliantly at that. You can\npause the screen, summon your godly\ncanvas and literally stroke slices upon\nyour foes. Perhaps you\u2019re low on health\nand need protection: why not let a forest of trees shield you.\nWhen it comes to solving puz-zles, you\u2019re offered a growing level of\nbreadth and imagination. Yes, there\nis a lot of environmental sentiment\ningrained into the experience but it\u2019s\nwrapped in a package that will more\noften than not make your jaw drop in\nawe. Okami is a long adventure but a\nsurprisingly tranquil, retrospective one\ndespite the need for skirmish \u2013 if you\nneed to unwind it can serve as an unusual visual respite.\nN for Nynja\nIn the ongoing pirate-ninja wars, N\nis the most compelling argument for\nninja superiority. Forget Johnny Depp\u2019s\ncharming drunken swagger \u2013 N wipes\nthe floor with him by combining one\nof the simplest control schemes of the\npast decade with beatifully fluid move-ment, creating a frenetic mix of action\nand classic platformer gameplay. With\na solid physics engine and wonderfully\ncontext-sensitive controls, the game is\nthe epitome of lo-fi gaming, which will\nsuck you in and consume your lunch\nbreaks while you give it \u201cjust one more\ntry\u201d.\nPlay it online or download\nit at www.harveycartel.org/\nmetanet/n.html\nAzfarul Islam\nSebastian Nordgren\nWolf + Tree = ...\nOkami is available in the UK now\nMultiplayer Mayhem\nFinished a Final Fantasy game\nto 100% completion?\nPerhaps you beat Half-Life at\nthe hardest difficult without\ndying?\nMaybe you\u2019ve wracked up\ninsane scores playing Snake.\nIf you\u2019re passionate about\nvideogames then why not\nwrite about them?

People have\nbeen scarring pretty patterns into their\nskin since ancient times. Roman emperor Caesar wrote that, \u2018All Briton\u2019s\nstain their skins with woad\u2019, and Herod\nof Antioch was apparently amazed to\nfind that \u2018Britons wear animals \u201cincised\u201d into their bodies\u2019.\nThe word tattoo comes from the\nsound the tattooing instrument makes on the skin\nof those being tattooed and derives\nfrom the Polynesian word \u2018ta\u2019\nwhich means to strike\nsomething. Polynesia\nis often credited as the\nculture with the most\nimportant influence\non the art of tattoo-ing. However, in ancient\ntimes, tattoing was also\nwidespread throughout the\nrest of the world.\nThere is evidence of tattooing\neven in the Bronze Age (3500 -1100BC) in the mummified body\nof \u00f6tzi. \u00f6tzi, the five thousand year\nold ice man, was discovered\non a mountain between austria & italy, his frozen body\npreserving his 57 tattoos.\nA cross on the inside of\nthe left knee, six straight\nlines 15 centimeters\nlong above the kidneys\nand parallel lines on his\nankles.\nIn Celtic culture symbolic tattoos were very\npopular. The most common tattoo designs were\nof spirals, and knotwork.\nThe complex braids of\nknotwork tattoos symbolised the connection of all\nlife. Step or key celtic designs\nsymbolised the various paths\nof life\u2019s journey.\nIn Russia, mummies found\ndating from around 2400\nyears\nago, are tattooed with a variety of ani-mals. Some, like griffins and various\nmonsters are believed to have a magical significance, others are decorative,\nand some are to signify status.\nJapanese people were mostly interested in the decorative aspect of tat-toos. The horis (japanese tattoo artists)\nwere innovators in the use of colours,\nperpective and design.\nSome tattoos were restricted by gen-der. In Egypt, female mummies have been\nfound with\ntattoos of\nabstract geometric patterns made\nup of lines\nand dots,\nan art\nform\nrestricted to women only.\nHowever this rich tradition of tattooing was almost destroyed in the West\nby the Church. A passage in the Old\nTestament, Leviticus 19:28, states \u201cYou\nshall not make any gashes in your flesh\nfor the dead or tattoo any marks upon\nyou.\u201d And so tattooing became banned\nby church edict.\nPreviously tattoos were used as status symbols of importance and power\nwithin religious communities, even in\nearly Christian society.\nFor centuries afterwards tattoos were\nstigmitised as uncivilised. Pagan tribes\nthat were converted to Christianity had\ntheir cultural traditions such as body\nmodification forbidden by their new\nreligion. Tattoos were still widespread\nin many societies not touched by\nChristianity, such as tribal\nand warrior societies,\nand by people on its\noutskirts of society, such\nas pirates and robbers.\nIn the 18th century explorers\nreturning from\ntheir travels\nexhibited\ntattooed polynesians to the public, to\ndemonstrate how \u201cprimitive\u201d their society was.\nHowever the return of captain Cook\nfrom Polynesia created a resurgance in\nthe popularity of tattoos with sailors.\nBy the end of the 18th century most\nBritish ports had at least one professional tattoo artist. And so began the\nreintroduction of tattoos into western\nculture.\nIn 1862, the Prince of Wales had a\njerusalem cross tattooed onto his arm,\nwhich was emulated by the aristocracy.\nEchoed in the way tattoos took off with\nthe general population after it becoming popular with celebrities in the late\n20th century.\nLike many things\nbanned by reli-gion, as new\ngenerations\ngrow up\nand reject the\ndoctrine\nof their\nparents,\npointless\ntaboos are\nshaken off.\nTattooing is\nheretostay,chang-ing it\u2019s form according\nto the whims of\nfashion.\nCOOL\nTattoos have always been around, to rebel or conform, for decoration or elevation\nLAME\n\n"

Among the\nattendees were CEOs of tech start-ups and established industry leaders,\nventure capitalists, senior academics\nand researchers liaising with industry\nand other senior level management.\nAmong the companies represented\nwere BT, BAE Systems, National Instruments, Durham Scientific Crystals\nand Surrey NanoSystems.\nThe SMF is a society that aims to\nfind the best and most capable engineers with a strong entrepreneurial\nand leadership bias and offer them\nbursaries to pursue MBAs at the top\nschools the world over. Upon finishing\nthese courses, the brilliant individuals\nbecome fellows of the Society and have\nunbridled access to top-level mentor-ing, networking events and career\nadvice.\nThe aim of this roundtable was not\nnecessarily to tackle specific and constricted ideas but instead, to open a\nforum where thoughts could be presented and discussed without stifling.\nBeneath the slightly corporate feel of\nthe event, something much greater\ntook stage; the passion the participants\nhad to to push the limits and boundaries of cooperation between academia\nand industry. While passion is clearly\nimportant, unfortunately, it yields\ndisappointingly intangible and meaningless results. This passion needs be\ncoupled with the drive to take some\npretty extravagant theories and ideas\nand see them through to a completion\nstage where they can actually make a\nsignificant and real impact. From everything that was said and discussed,\nparticipants at the table were all too\nclearly aware of this and did their part\nto make sure that everyone surrounding them appreciates how paramount\nthis drive is.\nPossibly the most important issue\ntackled was the future of this co-oper-ation between industry and academia;\nwho is best fitted to take positions of\nleadership in this realm of so-called\ntech transfer, and how to find the people who can make this process more\norganic and ubiquitous.\nWhile the was general consensus was\nthat an increased awareness of innova-Felix attends an idea sharing event and talks about industry, academia and the television show Dragon\u2019s Den\ntion in industry can, in small measures,\nbe a good thing, a mediatic overexposure through popular mainstream\nshows like \u2018Dragon\u2019s Den\u2019 or \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 can actually have quite adverse effects on the industry. One of\nthe main issues comes in the form of\nrecruiting.\nSome of the industry leaders present\nmentioned that after some of these\nshows they experienced a \u201cnon-desirable\u201d increase in numbers of applicants\nfor advertised positions. It may sound\nparadoxical that an increase in applicants is seen to be a negative issue, but\nif this increase is exclusively derived\nfrom mass applications of under-quali-fied applicants lured by the prospect of\na quick buck and immense riches, one\ncan start understanding how this can\npossibly be.\nEven though it was only very briefly\ntouched upon, something that also\nAfonso Campos\nBusiness Editor\nseemed to bother most participants\nis the undeniable fact that there is still\nsome unjustified resistance on the part\nof some academics to integrate this\nworld of tech transfer.\nIt seems as if some purists prefer to\nkeep their findings exclusive to science and refuse to make them part of\nthis domain where they can actually\nget projects implemented and seen to\ncompletion. On another part of this\nspectrum of backwards thinking, some\nacademics keep their discoveries in absolute secrecy with the hope that they\nmight one day be able to find an application for them and consequentially,\nnot share the limelight (read: prestige,\nmoney) with another soul. Needless to\nsay that neither approach benefits society at large in any way possible, and\nmuch less the scientists behind these\nideas.\nWhile the defendants of this camp\nmay argue that taking these approaches keeps the supposed \u201csanctity of science\u201d, they forget that the goal of science is much greater and noble; that\nis, to increase in any way possible the\nquality of life of every soul on this\nplanet.\nFor the number of questions originally posed to the table for open debate, a\ngreat multitude of questions arose for\nfurther discussion. The nature of these\nquestions prompted an interest from\nall participants to sit down together\nagain some point in the close future.\nIt is events like these that question\nthe current state of things and perpetuate our quest for evolution of thought.\nThey are a cry, and a loudly voiced\nstatement, connecting some and reconnecting others with the urgency of\ndoing and thinking something really\ndifferent \u2013 no matter how wild it may\nat first seem.\nThe roundtable discussion held in the Tanaka Business School was attended by companies such as BT, BAE Systems and National Instruments\nThe Apprentice... ...and Dragon\u2019s Den. Two shows which have led to a \u201cnon-desirable\u201d increase in numbers of job applicants\n\n"
