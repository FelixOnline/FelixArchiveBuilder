    "content": "2\nFELIX PROFILE John Donald Chadwick, President,\nImperial College.\nParticularly appropriate for a year\nin which the average age of Onion members\nreaches a new low, this year's President,\nJohn Chadwick, is the youngest to fill this\noffice for many years. He was bom in Bolton in1935 and was educated at Boltom\nSchool.\n'Chad' entered Guilds in October '53.\nHe is now a post-graduate in the lubrication\nlaboratories of the Mech. Eng. department.\nIn his last academic year he was VicePresident of Guilds. 'Chad', unlike the\nlast three presidents,is a Boat Club man,\nhe stroked the First VIII in'56. His\npopularity, however, unlike so many Union\nofficials in the past, is not based upon\nhis sporting prowess. Newcomers to the\nCollege will find a readily approachable\nand unassuming friend who has the interests\nof the Union members at heart.\nAs a guide to Presidential^ oli oy in the coming session, it is worth noting that\nChad says he feels somewhat worried about\nthe situation which has arisen through the\nself-deception of Imperial College students\ninto thinking that they and their\ncontemporaries at this mecca of technology\nshould not take part in any extra mural activities that may be ol assed as creative.\nHe considers that this is all too apparent\nin the number that actively contribute to\nthose aspects of Union affairs which are\nnot directly re creative. Chad is a man\nwho practices what he preaches.\n/.CMAS POINT OF VIEW\nWho brightens up a rl nii and rainy day\nwith a warm smile? Who is well-dressed?\nWho does not oom e into lectures with a growth of beard on the face, varying in length from a day to a week? Who pours\nwater on certain unarmed but deserving\nheads? - but, who is NOT willing to brew\ncoffee at all hours of day and night?\nTes, you're right every time it is I. C.W. A. that small band of unspoiled\nwomanhood who understands, mothers and tends\nall those lost sheep (including navy black\nones) who come to them for shelter. I. C.W. A. are those virtuous young ladies whom\nyou o an see from time to time, gracing the\nprecincts of the College. How often have\nyou spurned them and turned to less worthy\nfemales? When the awakening comes to you\nyou will realise that nowhere else perfection lies except in I. C.W. A. FRESHERS WELCOME\nWelcome fresher, wo loom es ll. For once again loud feet do fall Upon our noble college floors\nAnd once again you bang the doors.\nToday at last we do return\nAfter this our long sojourn\nOf Summer Vac, and journeys far, And visit soon the friendly bar.\nA couple here, a small group there,\nRecount the tales they cannot bear\nTo leave untold another day;\nThe stories of their latest fray.\nAmidst this crowd the fresher moves\nAnd thinks at last of many loves,\nOf Soccer, Rugger, Jive and Squash\nWith which he hopes to out a dash.\nNow of the many there will be a few\nWho think that everything is now\nAnd se they hls ze some fresh rw r way a With wh i oh to fill their leisure days.\nBut soon,alas,they often find That sll the pleasures of the mind\nCan force outside the time to learn\nInto the hours when candles bum.\nDo not forget, C readers sll.

However, finding himself in possession of an\nincriminating document, to wit, the ticket,\nhe decided that this should also be looked\nafter carefully, so he put it in a parcel\nwhich he left at another London: terminus.\nBut inevitably he found nim self in the unenviable position! of having yet another ticket,\njust as dangerous as the first. Have you\never tried to get rid of a fly-paper inadvertently grasped instead of a light card?\nI doubt it, but perhaps you get an inkling of\nhis panic He rushed wildly from terminus\nto terminus trying to rid himself of the para\ns it lo ticket. His good nature left hii r. Cynical and embittered, the parcels\nbecame more and more lethal. Instead of a bottle of beer and a packet of crisps, he\nused noxious chemicals and was in the\nprocess of making a time-bomb to end the\ntrial when he thought of the Unionv\nGratefully he thrust the current ticket at\nthe astonished R.C.S.

    "content": "FELIX WHILE THE SUN SHINES\nThis year, to the surprise of all,not\nleast the Dramatic Society itself, means for a summer tour were again made available.\nA play was decided upon, and John Askew\nwillingly came forward to produce it. Miss\nRosemary Melville, the able secretary, arranged \"cheap wholesome lodgings\" in Bedford, the town fated to reo i eve the burnt\noffering. Several oar trips to Bedfor by\nenthusiastic publicity agents ensued.\nPosters were distributed liberally to\nthe extent that the Town Clerk of Bedford\no a j tpl al ned that they would kill the trees\ncm wh i oh they had been pinned.\nRehearsal of the play \"While the\nSun Shines\" by Terence Rattigan, and the\nbuilding of the set began just eight days\nbefore the first performance with no little trepidation! on the part af some actors, who\ndoubted their ability to grasp their parts\nin so short a time. Towards the end of the\nweek the costumes arrived,whilst the scenery\nwas well on the way to completion. On\nthe Friday, Saturday and Sunday all the\ntransport that could be requisitioned, heavily\nladen with scenery, actors and suitably/ be-labelled with posters, set off for Bedford.\nBy this time it was obvious that \"the\nsun was going to shine\", and in the longest\nheat wave of the summer the society was performing an the stage of the Civic Theatre,\nstill o over ed with stage hands, putting the\nfinishing touches to the set.\nThe first performance,to a minute\naudience, was marred only by the bells in the neighbouring church steeple which\nrang for an hour in the middle of the\nplay. After each night's performance a visit was made to the \"Rose\", a local pub, followed by midnight bathing in the\nriver. During the day swimming, boating a and tennis were indulged in, whilst some\nvisited Woburn Abbey.\nBy tr adit i Ott, after the last performance a party had been arranged. This\ntime it was not the usual on-stage affair, but a barbecue by the river some miles\nout of the town. This was a complete\nsuccess, although during the celebrations\na cider flagon was stolen by a local res ident who was subsequently booked and\nbrought to trial for the offence. This\nwas the only time the Dram. Soo.seemed to\nbe on the right side of a somewhat over\nsuspicious Bedford constabulary, who\nthroughout the tour kept a close watch on\nthe Theatre from the Police Station next\ndoor.\nAs a holiday, this visit waa wholly\nsuccessful: financially it waa ad is mal failure. The troup left one of it saw a aber s more profitably installed as a barman in the \"Hose\".\nIN MEM OR I AM\nThe paper birch tree in the North\nWesterly part of the Beit Garden was\npresented to the College by Miss Gladys\nDuncan in memory of her brother John\nDunean.who was a lecturer in the Civil Sngineerirg Dept. of the City and Guilds\nOcOlegc fro a1946 to 1553 when he died\nafter a serious illness. SOCIAL WHIRL\nSocial life at I.C. presents a wide\nvariety of distractions. In addition to the\nweekly dances ('hops') the session is punctuated by such functions as the\nCommemoration and Country House Balls, the Carnlvalia, and divers Rags and\nOrgies.\nL.C. he ps are held every Saturday\nevening, the band is usually very good\nj nrc vi ding music for both squares and hep-cats. The quality of the women attending\nis good, and the quantity sufficient.\n<\\ A oi\nThe Commemoration Ball is publicised\nelsewhere; the Country House Ball is held\nin May at Silwood Park, I.C.'s Field Station amidst the rural beauties of the\nBerkshire countryside.\na \u00bb of\nThree times a year the Concert Hall is transformed into a wild and uninhibited\nscene of gaiety V la Parisienno. Panoily\ndressed revelers dance to two bands,\nparticipate in the cabaret and dine off oh i pol at as and Mooney's much-vaunted\ntrifle.& uf\nA solemn warning, there is a tendency\non the part of the Constabulary to di so our as e localised cloudbursts,and union\nMeetings in Piccadilly Station. Furthermore,\ncars must not be parked on the 1st. and\n2nd. floors of College buildings.\nSAYING OF THE FORTNIGHT\nThe Acting Editor of Phoenix:\n\"We must not be too ambitious\"\nTONY HODGSON\nThe non-appearance at the beginning\nof this term of Anthony Hodgson the Vice\nPresident of the R.C.S. Union and Chairman of the Social ClubsCctmdttee, has\nbeen referred to in the report of the Expedition that recently returned from\nNorway. Tony and Mike Curb(whilst\no limb inga buttress on a mountain that\nthe whole party had previously surmounted,\nwere overtaken by bad weather. During\nthe descent,whilst Tony as the leader was\na bse i ling on the last pitch,the piton\nsecuring the rope dislodged itself, and\nhe fell60 ft. on to the rock below,\nresulting in a broken thigh, fractured leg,\nserious injuries to his head and face,and\nfractured arm. Hike Gorb managed to climb\ndown and run to the camp where the other\ntwo members of the Expedition were working\nand notified a rescue party to come to his\naid. The rescue party carried Tony on a stretcher far seven hour a about half way\nto the hospital. They were then met by\na helicopter sent by the Norwegian Authorit ies, wh i oh flew Tony to Narvik where he\nwas taken to hospital. He has since made\ngood progress, and hopes to return to England in the near future.\nCOMraCKATION BALL.\nThe Ninth Annual Coarwraoration Ball\nwill be held on Thursday 24th.

There is a theme for each weekend to wh i oha guest speaker pre-eminent in his particular field is invited. In no circumstances\nare the subjects for discussion to be of a scientific nature, and these meetings were\nintended from the start to encourage the\nrational is ation of the education of member!\nof Imperial College. In part they are meant\nto be the complement of General Studies\nLectures, and thus to enable students to\ngain a wider understanding of that most\nimportant faculty of the Human Mind, that\nof clear thinking allied with the ability to express ones lf dearly on Human Problems\nto other members of w \u00bbr \u00bbn~^ without difficulty or em baras s ment.

RE OCCUPATION OF THE UNION THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE\nIt is with great pleasure and relief that I am able to welcome the freshmen; and\npresent students bao k after the vacation to a building that is ready to receive them.\nAll work that was planned for the vacation\nhas been completed, excepting the Gymnasium\nwh i oh suffered the setback of seemingly inevitable administrative procrastination.\nNew sofas have been installed in the Lounge,\nand the excess furniture has been distributed around the Union building. The session\nbegins with the advantage over the last few\nyears of being more than ever suitable for\nour activities. Now that the building is complete it is its use that merits mention. The now\nextinct House Committee, in a report presented to the Union last year, put forward\nvarious recommendations for the conduct of\nthose using the building . Those were adopted with acclamation and a copy appeared\non the Union not ioe board. Some students,\none hopes from ignorance rather than malice,\ndid not follow the Union decisions. Uni.cn\nofficers are not policeman, and do not\nwish to appear so; the responsibility rests\non each and every Union member to obey the\nrul.es his Union has made.\nIt is very important to realise that\nthe Union and all its facilities are not\njust another of the amenities that are\nprovided for students at Imperial College.\nThe Union is provided by the members\nfor the members. Anyone with useful\nsuggestions or criticisms should\napproach the appropriate student officer either personally or in writing.\nHe will be failing in his duty If the\nserious suggestions are not fully investigated. The Union is for the members and I urge you to take all advantage of it and use it. J.

Initially the party\nsuffered from a series of headaches induced\nby the altitude,but th la has not hampered\ntheir work in surveying the Siachen Glacier.\nIn July the Expedition was delayed seventeen days due to shipping difficulties. To\ncompensate for this members of the expedition will leave later than had been planned.\nIn fact, they have only one quarter of the\ntime needed to make a complete survey of this\narea. Apart from the somewhat monotonous\ndiet during their stay in Tndla everyone is now contented.\nIt is worth mentioning that the\nbulletin came one hundred and sixty miles\ns eros a fairly difficult country to the Post\nOffice at Skardu, which gives some indication\nof the vastness of the area in which they are\nworking, A fuller report will be appearing\nin FS LH when the expedition returns.\nTHE MILLERHORN\nI.C. IN NORWAY\nOn July 1st. four members of Imperial\nCollege, Dave Baxter, Pat Pavkes, Mike\nGorb and Tony Hodgson, left London for\nArctic Norway to carry out mountaineering\nexploration round Altevaten, close to the\nSwedish border. Although the area had\nbeen surveyed during the war, its mountaineering possibilities were still un-known.\nWithin a week the party had set up a base camp at the western end of the lake,\nand by July 11th. it was within striking distance of the mountains. After only a few days ^limb ing and surveying it was clear\nfrom the views seen while on Kirkestund\n(5120ft) and Maddanipa (4900ft) that the\nneighbouring mountains had not much to offer to the mountaineer; the few rook\nfaces that were in evidence were badly\nweathered. It was decided, therefore, to\nmove base camp further westwards to ju3t north of Bardu, where the country looked\nmare promising.\nHowever, the part was deprived of\nthe opportunity of exploring this region\nas, on July 16th. Tony Hodgson fell some\n50ft. while a bse i ling and was seriously\ninjured. 30 hours later he was admitted to\nNarvik hospital. With the number thus\ndepleted it was decided that further surveying in the area would not be possible, and\nso a fortnight later another base camp had\nbeen established near the Stor stein af Jill massif 25 miles from Narvik, with a high\ncamp on a glacier to the south. A further\ndisappointment was then experienced due to the bad weather which kept the party tent-bound for several days.\nNevertheless, during the remaining 3\nweeks some good climbing was had on both\nrook and ice, with an adventurous crossing\nof an ioe fall on Kuinaookka. Two probable first ascents were made; the Stcrtuod\nRidge and an unmarked \u2022bump\" marked 1367 m, while other oli irb a included Ippovarre,\nKninarookka and Nikkiookka. The la at tv o days were spent on Stor steins f Jill where\nthe three members of the party were confined to their tio-man tent while a bliss j rd raged outside.\nIt was with mixed feelings that on the\n22nd. August the party retreated from\nStorsteinafJ ill; dia appoint msn tin that\nlittle had been achieved in6 w sf ek s, but &\nsense of well-being after such a long period\namong the mountains au ay from civilisation.

Dick Saunders played Lord Harpenden, AbleSeaman R.N., with occasional lapses into\nsc mev hat un lordly bearing even for an\nable-seaman. Susan Cocmbes, as Lady\nElizabeth, W.A.A.

Dave Griffin blustered In\nhis usual manner to quite good effect.\nThe production was, on the whole good,\nbut despite copious advertising the sun\nshone and audiences were poor. The tour\nwas, however, very good experience and\nvery enjoyable. At the risk of being trite I would conclude that the Sun Shone for better and far worse.\nA. J. Eycott.\nCL \u00a3ett e%p tw n the CUde&t Alem fret\nDear Fresher,\nAs the senior active member of the\nFelix Board it be hove s me to write a few,\nprobably distasteful, words of advice on\nthe jap a a aio a of your reception into our\nfo J BF Woaa\nare not the only words of\na dvr ft e you will receive, aa by now you\nwill no doubt have realised.\nFirst I must disillusion you. It is\nunlikely that you are about to receive a 'university e duo at ioa i'. Imperial College\nis little more than part of the university\nby name alone; moat of Its departments\nrepresent little more than a scientific and\ntechnological 'cramming school'.\nIn moat cases the taxpayer or the rate-payer is providing the money for you to\ncome here, because they have been told\nthat the Country needs scientists sad\ntechnologists. You are therefore under an\nobligation to become well-qualified in\nyour chosen profession. In due course\nquite a few of you will realise that you\nhave oho a en the wrong profession; you\nwill disappear from our midst without\ngraduating. It is. In any o a se,a policy\nof the College to take more people Into the\nfirst year than o an be accomodate d in the\nthird year, for this reason.\nTou will not learn to accept responsibility in the lecture theatre or In the\nlaboratory. In these two places you will\nbe spoon-fed. tou will obtain no practice\nin asking important decisions, and little oha no e of learning how to 'get on' with\nyour fellows and to 'handle people'.\nVery few of you already possess these\nquail tie a in adequate amount, unless you\nhave been in the Services. Tou must look\nelsewhere than your course and the seclusion\nof your lodgings for this part of your\ntraining.\nXes, you have earns here to work, and\nunless the selection system has erred, you\nhave come to do your beet. In ay experience\nthine is no truer sapi as; than that what you\nput into a project ia a direct measure of\nthe value eventually obtained from it. Let\nus therefore consider xh at it ia that you\nwish to obtain fr on your stay bare. Tour\nambition is to hold down a well rcm aera tcd Job wh i oh oar rie e responsibility for men\nand materials; a Job in which you are\nrespected as an able a ea bar of your pro-fess ion, and one in wh i oh you have the\nopportunity to he an individual, if you\nare prepared Just to he a scientific or\ntechnological brain used and 'pushed around'\nby others who carry the responsibility and\nmake the decisions, you have no right to be\nat Imperial College.\nI suggest that the only way by wh i oh you will become a man instead of a moron\nis by mingling with your fellows on the\nsocial and sporting levels. Participate\nin the College social and athletic clubs.\nHave an a tter with your friends over a drink\nin the bar. Go to Dinner-in-Hall now and\nagain to meet some of the more senior\nmembers of the College. Mix with people\nin other departments and people in other\n'year e'. But, you are here to work, to study.\nStriking a balance between work and play la a very individual matter; one in wh i oh nobody but yourself o and eo ide. Your work\nand play should give each other mutual\nassistance: both should help you in your\npreparation for your career.\nIn conclusion hare is a piece of\nadv ioe which many of ray contemporaries\nwould appear to dispute. In my opinion\nyour attitude, particularly where examinations are concerned, should not arise\nfro a the idea of either passing or fall ing, getting a'fl rct' or a 'second'.\nTour attitude should be one of intention\nto do better than your fell ov c. Yours sincerely,\nHubert Edsuln S nith\n\n"

The Club has won the London University Rugby Cup four tines in the\nlast six years and the 1st. XV has a very j strong fixture list. Every standard of\nplayer is catered, for in the six teams and\nit is hoped that all fresher s who have played\nrugby will turn up at the trials on the\nafternoons of Wednesday October 2nd., and\nSaturday October 5th. at Harlington both\nthese days.\nAn added attraction to this year's players is the Xmas tour to South-western\nTrance. The o lub has fixtures against\nSari at (December 29), Saintes (January 1st), and Eoyan (January 5).\nIP TOTJ PLAY RUGBY I.C.E. F.C. NEEDS TOO J it II UNDERWATER CLUB So this is the underwater sport!\nFor those who don't know, the I.C.u h der Water Club was only formed at the\nend of the last session; for those who went\nto the summer Diving Camp, the lack of preparation made this painfully obvious.\nThe coast around the camp at Sharkham\nPoint (near Paignton) looked quite promising\nfor diving in spite of hazards created by\nBank Holiday fishermen The first set-back,\nthat the promised large tents had not\nmaterialise d, really made itself felt on\nthe first Wednesday when three of the five\ntents were blown down during the night.\nThe drenched occupants were left with the\nalternative of crowding either into the\nremaining tents or a oar.\nThese minor d is oom forts apart, the sea\nwas surprisingly warm, and by the beginning\nof the second week'everybody had lone some\ndiving with the aqualung s and as much\nsch no rk eling as they liked. One of our\nnumber, to his surprise, speared a sizeable\ngrey mullet which the frying pan shortly\nconverted into a most edible dish. Later,\nplaice, mackerel and crabs were caught by\nless sporting means.\nTowards the end of the fortnight, o amp life began to have its effect; tempers frayed\nbut the o amp bad served its purpose. A nucleus of enthusiasts now exists, and with mere\nexperience (and money) r. very active o lub should be built up in the next year to two.\nMediterranean here we oe met CRICKET CLIMAX\nTowards the end of the summer term,\nwith examination worries a thing of the\npast, the I.C. team played some brilliant cricket. Exciting victories were gained\nover U.C. and Eastcote C.C, each in the\nlast over, and King's were held to a draw.\nThe match against the team of old students,\nled by the notorious F.G. Davies, resulted\nfor the first time in a win for the old lags and proved a memorable social occasion\nin addition to a fine match. At the end\nof the term the team, slightly depleted,\nleft for an invasion of Devon and performed\nvery well on some occasions, not so well on\nothers!\nI.C. batted first in the old student's match (once the old students had been extracted from the Red Lion), and made 205-8\ndec. Bhatti made 47 and Kitohener was bowled for46 by Dan Eastland, who, in his day\nhad been, like hiss victim President of\nI.C. The old lags passed this total for the loss of 7 wickets, Graham Eastland\nmaking 83.\nIn a high scoring match with U.C.,I. C. were set to make 181 in2 i hrs., and\nachieved their goal without being unduly\npressed in the last over. Shepherd (46),\nBhatti (47 not out), and Kitohener (80 not\nout) being mainly responsible. They were\nset a similar task by Eastcote in the next\nmatch, and steadier bowling left them 107\nstill to get in the last hour and 75 in the\nlast 25 minutes. After a spell of al lout attack four were still required when\nthe last over began. Kitchener (67) was\nrun out. off the second ball and Whiddon\nstrode in with 2 wanted. He rose to the\noccasion by playing his finest innings of\nthe season, and returned to the pavilion\ntriumphant, 2 not out, amidst scenes of\ngreat enthusiasm. Bhatti made 79 not cut.\nDytham found that he had almost chewed his\nfinger nails off.\nSo to Devon, where, for the first few\ndays, a reaction seemed to set in i The R.N. Engineering College, one of the strongest\nteams in Devon last summer, were dismissed\nfor 215, thanks mainly to Hearn (5 for 61)\nbut after a fair start I. C.ool lapsed and\nmade only 103 (Bhatti 37). Tho following\nday against the R \u00abN. Barracks, Kapur made\na brilliant57 which was a firm foundation\nto I.C.'s. total of 142, but this proved in adequate and the Barracks won by 6 wickets.\nAfter an undistinguished draw with tha\nPlymouth Police (but a riot of entertainment\nin the Police Station afterwards) I.C. presented Whimple with a new ball and were\nbowled out with it for 101. Stumps are\ndrawn at Whimple when the oh urch bells begin to ring, but on this occasion, with\nWhimple requiring only one for victory,\nthis rule was overlooked and Whimple beat\nI.C., for the first time since 1951, by 3\nwickets. C. Pearoe scored 20 and took 2\nfor 13.\nTRIALS\nSOCCER, RUGBY AND HOCKEY TRIALS WILL BE HELD AT THE I.C. SPORTS GROUND, EARUNGTCO,\nON WEDNESDAY OCT. 2ND AND SATURDAY, OCT 5TH. FREE TRANSPORT LEAVES THE UNTAX AT\n1.30 PJ L THE COACHES WILL START BACK FROM BARLTNCTCW AT 6 P.M. CRICKET Ccoat)\nThis brought a revival in the I.C. fortunes and easy victories were gained\nover the Marines at Lymp3tone where Bhatti\ntook 6-31 and Brixham, who were put out\nfor 45 (Shilling 4-235. Against Exmouth\nI.C. really got back into their stride,\nand despite P. Davies' farcical running\nbetween wickets made 158-9 dec.\n(Kitchener 81 n.o.). A laughable incident during this innings came when\nB. Heam glared at the local umpire and\nso ow led at all and sundry during his\nmarch p avil icj jj rard s, after being given out\n1> B w off a ball which would have removed\nthe middle stump. Spirits thus: ran high for the annual ola ah with Torquay, but this ,\nthe last match of the tour, was. rained of fp a great disappointment.\nAltogether I.C. had a very joo es sf ttl season, with moments of unprecedented\ngreatness, which might have occurred more\noften in the tail had not been so long.\nOn and off the field a fine team spirit was\napparent, and some extraordinary events\ntook place on the tour, notably when weekend visitor D. Harrhy mistook a coal-shut e for the front door of our hostelry.\nHis body was recovered after an hour's hard labour, and being found to exhibit\nsym toms of life, was put to bed.\nFreshers who hope to participate in this great college institution should avoid\nmaking any engagements for the 2 weeks\nimmediately following the summer term.\nGLIDING\nNATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS SUCCESS With the National Gliding Championships\nand the Yugoslavian tour,the gliding o lub has had a busy summer.

The folic wing five and a half weeks\nwere spent in the mountains, living in the huts cf the French Alpine Club.\nHaving first spent a day in Argentiere\nbuying food (wh i oh later resulted in large\nquantities of starch being prepared under\nthe impression that dehydrated potatoes had\nbeen bought), the next day saw the party\nmaking its way up to the Argentiere hut\nand having their first sight of the great\npeaks in the area. A day was then spent\npractising Alpine technique on snow and ioe -only two of the party had climbed in the\nAlps before. (Six experienced I.C. mountaineers were on the Karakoram Expedition).\nClimbing then began in earnest with the\ntraverse with the Tour Noil'.\nThroe days later, fr on the Albert Hut,\nthe party undertook a long and \"quite difficult\" route across the glacier to the\nForbes are te of the A igu ille de Chardonnet\nwhich is a classic among Alpine climbs and\ninvolves about twelve hours of sustained\no limb ing on rook and steep snow and ice slopes. At the summit the weather was so\nfine and the air so o lear that the Matterhorn could be seen to the East almost 50\nmiles away, and to the South through a heat\nhaze, ths valleys of Italy were seen. The\ntwo experienced members also climbed the\nAiguille du Tour on the fallowing day.\nThe Qouverole Hut was reached after a> very wet and cold day's crossing of the\nHer de Glace. The next few days saw a deterioration in the weather. The only good\nday was spent on the Aiguille de Moine wh i oh was o limbed by the Southwest Arete - a long;\nrock ridge of average standard. The scenery\nan this route was magnificent with Mont\nBlanc only about three miles away, and delicate rock tracery of the Chamonix Aigu ille s only just across the valley.\nThis was the last o limb, however,\nbecause even on the descent from the Koine\nths clouds were banking up. After two idly spent days it was decided to pack up and\ncome home. The party had enjoyed their trip; had learnt new o limb ing techniques, and\n\"had a lot of fun\".\nIncidentally, before journeying home,\nthe tuo motorcyclists had to recover their\nmachine from the police - who ol aimed that\nit had been abandoned.\nR.C.S. MOTOR CLUB\nSIL VER S TONE OUTING\nOn June 15th., 'Jezebel' accompanied\nby a ore* of 9, attended the IT.S. C.C. meeting at Silverstone, where she was\nplaced in ths paddock and attracted considerable attention, and admiration. The\nJourney of 120 miles, her farthest since\nshe was Drought up from Jarrington was\naccomplished vith out incident, but with\na prodigious consumption, of petrol. To\nhonour the suspension and ths big ends,\nspeed was kept te low25 m.p.h. It is hoped that the outing.will become an annual\none.\nSAI LING\nmembers of I.

J. M. ConwayJanes finished first but was disqualified\nfor a technical Infringement cf the rules\nand J.E. Smith gained third place.\nNational Firefly Week at Southend\nwas a disappointment.
