    "content": "22 felix Friday 9 May 2008\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\nOf Grand Tourists and Cherubs\nOur roving culture vulture Rosie Grayburn samples the delights of Pompeo Bitoni at the National Gallery\nThe author described this one as a \u201cminx\u201d. Not too sure about that but it beats smug tubby little bitches\nwith wings and arrows. Excuse me? A what? What\u2019s a cherub?\nI\nt was warm and sunny outside\u2026 maybe that\u2019s why no-one\nis around, I thought to myself as\nI waddled to the new exhibition\nat the NG. The grand staircase\ndown to the basement in the Sainsbury\nWing was absolutely deserted. Last\ntime I was here to see Renaissance Siena at Christmas, it was packed with\ntourists, old people AND screaming\nchildren \u2013 a perfect cross-section of\nyour average cultural London attrac-tion. Today, it was just me and a few\nscore paintings by a once-famous\nPompeo Batoni.\nPompeo Batoni was the most celebrated artist in 18th-century Rome.\nI had never heard of the guy and was\nkeen to learn more about him. I just\nhoped he wasn\u2019t all chubby cherubs\nand blushing goddesses. I picked up\nmy handy audio guide and entered the\n1st room. It was all chubby cherubs\nand blushing goddesses. Shit.\nThe first painting that caught my eye\nwas The Triumph of Venice. It is one\nof his early works and was commissioned by the Doge of Venice to commemorate how brilliant his city was.\nOn receiving this commission, Batoni\nmust have got out his \u20181000 Easy Ways\nto Put Symbolism into Your Paintings\u2019\nbook out and just copied every single\none down onto the canvas. There are\nmore divine beings here than you can\nshake a stick at and more allegories\nthan you could fit on one giant shell (as\ndepicted). There are random objects\nlying around all over the chaotic scene,\nall of which hold some kind of connection with Venice\u2019s prosperity. There are\ncherubs bouncing around the frame\nholding pan pipes, set squares and\nhammers symbolising music, architecture and sculpture, thus referring to all\nthe things Venetians are good at. Blah\nblah blah.\nMaybe for his first action as our new\nmayor, Boris Johnson will commission\na similar piece. He will sit on a giant\nshell before a landscape of London\u2019s\nskyline and be surrounded by allegories of peace, gun crime and Starbucks.\nCherubs will be perched around his\nhead holding Olympic rings, Oyster\ncards and hard hats. Around their\nfeet will be organic vegetables, fried\nchicken and marijuana plants. Boris\nwill be flanked on either side by the\nGoddess of Council Tax and the God\nof Routemasters.\nIn the next room, I turn to my audio\nguide for sanity as I see more and more\ncherubs. I will have nightmares to-night, I swear. The little device around\nmy neck has become my very dearest\nfriend. The commentary is concise and\ninteresting, and I rather enjoy the different people they have roped in to talk\naboutBatoni.It\u2019sachangefromjustone\nsmooth-talking lady instructing you\non cherubs \u2013 there is a nice man who\nsounds like Loyd Grossman and some\nactor dude who talks in an appalling\nItalian accent pretending to be Batoni.\nThis is the best audio guide ever. After\nmost commentaries, there is an option\nto find out more info, which mostly includes gossip about Batoni, his patrons\nand fascinating snippets. Brilliant.\nIn room two the exhibition turns to\nthe mythological. These \u2018history painting\u2019 scenes were incredibly fashionable at the time. Everyone wanted a bit\nfrom the Old Testament or Greek Mythology on their wall as it made them\nlook educated! Due to their popularity,\nthey fetched up to 6-times the price of\na portrait of the same size. I liked Prometheus Fashioning Man Out of Clay,\nin which Prometheus is looking rather\nexasperated at Miranda who is just\nabout to animate his first clay model\nusing a butterfly, symbolising the soul.\nPrometheus clearly hasn\u2019t finished him\nyet, as his tools are still poised to finish the man-bits. The generic \u2018old man\u2019,\nlike Prometheus, is a theme recurrent\nthroughout Batoni\u2019s works - the wild\ngrey hair, mad eyes and flailing arms.\nAchilles also makes several appearances in Batoni\u2019s paintings. Batoni\nseems to have taken it upon himself to\nbe his personal biographer as practically all his life is played out over these\nwalls. Poor Achilles had one messed-up childhood. He was educated by a\ncentaur, then dressed up as a woman\nby his mother to protect him from\njoining the Trojan War. Fortunately,\nhis penchant for swords gave his clever\ndisguise away and off he went to war.\nThe first two rooms of Batoni\u2019s early\nwork are deceptive. He doesn\u2019t carry\non painting looser allegories all his\nlife: once he was recognised, he started\nto earn more and more commissions\nfrom a very different source.\nIn the mid 18th-century, it was custom for young gentlemen to go on a\ntour of Europe\u2019s sights after finishing\ntheir education. On their travels, it was\ncustomary for these visitors to pick up\nvarious souvenirs from the cities they\nvisited. When they went to Venice,\nthey commissioned a painting of its\nskyline by Canaletto; and when they\nwent to Rome, they got their portrait\npainted by a well-known Pompeo Batoni. He was the portraitist of choice\nfor British and Irish tourists on their\n\u2018Grand Tour\u2019.\nThese portraits of Grand Tourists\nare a breath of fresh air from the voluptuous mythological females next door.\nBatoni captures his patron\u2019s appearance with great accuracy and honesty. I\nlove the portrait of Lady Featherstonehaugh. Batoni portrays her as Diana,\nthe Roman goddess of the hunt. It reminds me of those creepy photo shops\nyou find in tourist honey pots in which\nyou dress up in a ridiculous Victorian\n\u201cPompeo Batoni\nwas the most\ncelebrated artist\nin 18th-century\nRome\u201d\nThis gentleman crossed his legs to stop just a little bit of wee from\ncoming out\n\n"

    "content": "10 felix Friday 9 May 2008\nComment, Opinion\n& Letters\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of Felix\nPolitical\nPhilosophy\nSociety\nAmmar Waraich\nChairman\n\u201c\nI think the\nPPS can deliver\nan amazing\nand unique\nexperience\nThe aftermath of the 25th April\nIn the last issue, Felix reported on the Political Philosophy Society\u2019s (PPS) \u2018Criminalising War\u2019 lecture given\nby Malaysia\u2019s 4th Prime Minister, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad. This week PPS Chairman Ammar Waraich\ngives his account of the event, its organisation, the College\u2019s restrictions, and the society\u2019s true intentions\nT\nhere is probably not much\nroom for originality now,\nconsidering everything\nthat has already been said\non Live!, the Facebook\nforums and last week\u2019s Felix, so I suppose this will very much be a comment\npiece from me, in the true sense of the\nterm.\nDisappointment\nLet me start with the disappointment I\nfelt. Firstly, from the individuals commenting on Live! who were quite happy to hide behind aliases and accuse\nthe PPS of bias without any evidence;\nwho went on to somehow infer that\nthis lecture on War was to be some\nsort of anti-Semitic seminar; and who\nthen went on to hurl border-line racist accusations at each other, proving\nthe need for frank dialogue on racial-religious matters to stop the world becoming even further polarised than it\nalready is.\nA few individuals decided to attack\nme personally, one of them deciding\nto use my religious beliefs as a justification to claim that \u201cit\u2019s time college\nand the police cracked down on these\npeople\u201d \u2013 and these are the people who\naccused the PPS of being racist!\nIt is surprising how easily these guys\nforgot our Genocide Awareness Week\nwhere we invited Jewish leaders to discuss the horrors of the Holocaust, and\nhow we were discourteous to a panellist we had ourselves invited to ensure\nthat Israel was represented at our Israel/Palestine debate. For some, I sup-pose, no matter what we do will not be\nenough, and maybe that\u2019s just politics.\nSecondly, I felt very disappointed\nat the Union. In the past, it has been\nvery helpful to the PPS; however in\nthis instance I was never made involved in any of the meetings or the\ndecision-making processes that led the\nCollege to enforce these restrictions,\neven though I explicitly requested to\nbe. Furthermore, according to the College, it was the Union that suggested\nthat visitors be limited to IC only and\nthe College used this to back up their\nstance claiming that if the \u201cstrongest\nsupporter of student rights\u201d thought\nso, they thought so too. If this is actually true, this really is a sad revelation.\nThirdly, I felt extremely disappointed\nat the College\u2019s decision and the manner in which they enforced it on the\nPPS. One can perhaps understand the\ndecision to limit the audience to IC\nstudents, in the hope that belonging\nto IC will stop them from in someway\nsaying inflammatory things, but then\nextending that to VIPs such as MPs,\nLords, Professors, heads of prestigious\nNGOs, Dr Mahathir\u2019s elderly wife and\nbody guards, etc. was way too much.\nIt was such an embarrassment to have\nto say to these people that they cannot\nenter when they arrived purely because\nthey do not have an Imperial ID!\nI had to turn away my own family,\nmy dear friends and even ex-Union\nPresident Mustafa Arif because none\nof them had a valid Imperial ID. This is\nclearly an over-reaction, and similarly I\ncannot see how extending the restrictions to banning recording and photography served any useful purpose,\nespecially since they were impossible\nto police.\nFinally, I was disappointed at the Ramadhan Foundation, who admittedly\nbrought us a fantastic speaker, but was\nun-cooperative and deceptive. In fact,\nthe only one who did not disappoint\nwas Dr Mahathir himself, and chairing\nthe Q&A that night was not only an\nhonour but also great fun.\nIntentions\nThe PPS has been very transparent\nwith the Union and College in the past\nand also with this event. We do not feel\nwe did anything wrong by inviting such\na high-profile speaker and our intentions were sincere. We were not looking to cause trouble or upset people,\nbut were looking to conduct powerful\ndiscussion on divisive issues.\nOur intention, certainly with this\nevent, was to raise Imperial\u2019s profile, as\nthis was Dr Mahathir\u2019s first ever public address and we wanted IC to be his\nchoice of venue rather than the usual\nLSE or SOAS, from whom he had also\nreceived offers. What we got in return\nwas a slap in the face as we were forced\nto essentially insult our invited guest.\nBeing on the receiving end of the\nhate and anger of hundreds of students\nfrom across the UK is also not a pleasant experience, nor is being forced to\njuggle your loyalty to Imperial with\ncourtesy to your guests. Being handed\na decision that you have to enforce the\nnight before, and against your original\nword, is a very stressful experience and\nwith repercussions for Imperial\u2019s and\nthe PPS\u2019s reputation, especially considering that many people had already\npaid for accommodation and travel.\nI do not think any of these factors\nwere considered by College when they\nliterally forced me to take these steps.\nAnd how could they have been, since\nI was never called to any of the meet-ings, having to chase developments\nonly to be told what the PPS has to do\nless than 24 hours before the event.\nI was left on the receiving end of everybody\u2019s criticism and felt that I really\ncould not turn to anyone for support\nand that was truly an emotionally and\nmentally exhausting experience. I do\nnot think the College considered these\npersonal issues at all.\nThe Way Forward\nWe want to make the PPS a premier\nstudent society in London as we think\nit offers something no other society in\nany other university offers, and in the\nprocess raise the Union\u2019s profile nationally by providing some excellent\nevents.\nSo now that all is said and done,\nwhere do we go from here? Well I think\nthe first step is demanding our right to\nhold events without the fear of College\npressure.\nWe want to have the freedom to invite who we want as long as it is legal.\nMost outspoken speakers will have\nsaid something that is inappropriate,\nbut where do we draw the line and start\nstifling freedom of speech? As long as\nthe address is legal, anybody from Galloway to Tamimi should be allowed to\nspeak.\nWe want external guests to be allowed to attend. If for example in Oxford, handling speakers is left to the\nsocieties themselves, and their student\ndebates are open to the general pub-lic, why does it have to be different at\nImperial, which claims to be equal in\nall manners to other top international\ninstitutions?\nWe certainly cannot prevent others\nfrom being interested in what the PPS\nis doing, especially with Facebook as a\npublicity tool, so why must we overly\ncomplicate things?\nWe also want the Union to continue\nbeing supportive of its clubs and societies and help them reach a resolution\nin disputes with full involvement in all\nthe decision making that affects them.\nI think this is a fair request.\nWe want parties who may have apprehensions or concerns with our\nevents to approach us directly to raise\nthe matter with us so we can make sure\nthat any concerns are taken on board\nduring the early stages of planning.\nThis will mean that things are settled\nwith the Union and College in time for\nthe events.\nI think we can safely say that most\nclubs and societies are behind us in\nthese requests as well as Felix and\nLive!, so we hope the College will consider them.\nClosing Comments\nI can appreciate why the Jewish Society\nraised their concerns. Their apprehensions were fully justified. I can even\nunderstand why the College did what\nthey needed to. At the end of the day,\ntheir job is to protect the reputation\nof Imperial and make sure things are\nsmooth and legal on campus \u2013 and ultimately the PPS is using College prop-erty. Moreover, maybe it is the first\ntime that Imperial has had to deal with\nsuch a situation that other broader-discipline universities such as Oxford,\nCambridge, LSE and SOAS are very\nfamiliar with.\nThe PPS does not echo the views of\nthe speakers that attend our events, or\nany of their previous comments. We\nare purely about the events and the\nearnest discussion that ensues from it,\nwhich will at some points need thorny\nissues to be tackled.\nWe would appreciate support instead\nof resistance. We would appreciate\nmore transparency and involvement\ninstead of being treated like children.\nAnd we would certainly appreciate\ntrust and assistance. With these requisites being met, I think the PPS can\ndeliver an amazing and unique experience not only for Imperial students\nbut for society as a whole, and in doing\nso we can raise the Imperial name as\nsomething above and beyond purely\nScience.\nUnion President, Steve Brown,\nwill be responding to this article\nin next week\u2019s issue\nTun Dr Mahathir Mohamad answering questions from Bangladeshi\nmedia after the PPS\u2019 \u2018Criminalising War\u2019 lecture on 25th April\n\u201c\nWe do not\nfeel we did\nanything wrong\nby inviting such\na high-profile\nspeaker and our\nintentions were\nsincere\n\u201d\n\n"

Several students\ninsisted that using the lawn during the exam period is a welcome\nbreak from stuffy libraries and crowded computer rooms. However\nthey were obviously too intoxicated with the spirit of freedom to\nbe taken seriously. News that several members of College staff,\nwhen approached by this reporter, said they were \u201ctoo busy\nsunbathing\u201d to comment, is completely unfounded.\nLast week, a student was taken to\nhospital after falling from a first floor\nwindow in Southwell Hall. The incident occurred in the early hours of the\nmorning on Monday 28th April.\nEmergency services, including the\nfire brigade, were called to the scene.\nThere they were required to cut the\nstudent free, since he had fallen onto\nthe railings below, avoiding a two-floor\ndrop into the basement entrance area.\nThe student was taken to hospital\nand initially put on life support.

If you don\u2019t want to\nstand yourself, voting for the majority\nof elections opens on 19th May, except\nfor the Engineering elections which\nopen on Monday 12th May.\nThe most important positions to be\nelected are the Faculty Union Presidents. The Presidents are\nresponsible for over-seeing, and representing the views and welfare of thousands of\nstudents, often in\nmeetings with\nCollege and ICU\nbigwigs.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDavid Paw\nArts Editor\nI\nlove summer. In our wonderful\nlittle town, we need little more\nthan a partial break in the clouds\nto run outside and work on le\ntan. And then it starts pissing it\ndown and everyone runs back inside.\nWill we ever learn? Probably not. However, every angry-looking rain-laden\ncloud has a creative silver lining. So\nwhen park / beer garden fatigue sets in,\ntake advantage of the elating cool and\nstillness of pretty much every major\ngallery in town,\nWhile everyone else is sweltering\nand pretending to be fabulous and not\non the verge of heatstroke, you can indulge in having a gallery all to yourself\nand not have it interrupted by screaming kids, people parking in front of pictures and blocking your view, poseurs\nand irritable boyfriends who would\nrather be somewhere else.\nOf course, you might want to head\nout as soon as you can. Unfortunately,\nMunoz\u2019s display at the Tate has just\nended, but you can still catch Peter\nDoig, Duchamp and Man Ray there.\nAnd if you haven\u2019t been over to the\nShad Thames to check out the little\nnook of town by the Design Museum,\ndon\u2019t hesitate to go as soon as you can.\nRichard Rogers really is one of our\nnational treasures. Technically marvel-lous, recognisable and incredibly well-designed, he makes a fine British pairing to his more showy contemporary\nSir Norman Foster. However, I would\ndisagree with Caz on the aesthetics\nfront, though I can see her point on the\nmore organic and naturalistic aspects\nof design.\nSadly, not everyone is inclined to\ndiscuss the aesthetics and direction\nof art and design as a discipline; the\npeople comissioning and working in\nsuch buildings will probably not care.\nSpecifications? Cold. Sleek. Something\nto make the rivals jealous. Which is\nprobably why so many artists have a\ncollective income equivalent to one\nNHS consultant.\nWhich is the extraordinary thing\nabout architecture. Though perhaps\nnot guaranteed to land one in the meg-abucks, as Caz stated in her piece a\ndiscipline melding aspects of creativity\nwith science can be immensely appeal-ing. And when the element of public\nservice comes into it, it can be altogether more satisfying.\nIt seems to be unique in that sense in\nstraddling the divide between creative\nand scientific. How many other mainstream disciplines can truly claim that?\nOf course, not everyone is inclined to\nboth camps, which explains the existence of science meccas like M.I.T,\nCaltech and, yes, Imperial.\nAlso, don\u2019t forget to check out the\nnew issue of Phoenix out in the next\nfew weeks. We\u2019ve been working hard\non it and we hope you pick up a copy to\nread in the quad on a sunny day.

What\nsummer?\nJuan Munoz rocks the Tate\nShahania Begum explores one artist\u2019s intriguing perspective at the South Bank\nThe crowd got a good laugh out of David James\u2019 \u201cperformance\u201d for Portsmouth\nT\no be honest, before I went\nto view this exhibition,\nI was quite unfamiliar\nwith the work of Spanish\nsculptor Juan Mu\u00f1oz. All\nI knew was that he was renowned for\nsculptural works in which he situates\nthe human figure within elaborate or\ncomplex architectural settings. I was\ncurious as to what else would be on\noffer at the first major retrospective\nof Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s work in the UK and how I\nas the viewer would engage with these\nchoreographed exhibitions.\nMu\u00f1oz\u2019s was born in Madrid in 1953.\nHaving worked as a curator and studied\nin London and New York he also exhibited his own works \u2013 which were principally sculptures. Having also been an\naccomplished writer and draughtsman,\nit may have been his storytelling ability\ncombined with his fascination with the\nway that the viewer encounters a work\nof art which brought about his international prominence in the mid-1980s.\nHis early work included iron welded\nspiral staircases starting and leading\nto nowhere, and incongruous balconies attached to a blank wall which\nencourages the viewers to be the vo-yeurs, imagining themselves watching people from the balcony, as well as\nbeing watched. One of his early works\nincludes a piece called If only she knew\n(1984) an iron house-like structure restrained by skinny supports, containing a single female carved stone figure\nsurrounded by several wooden male\nfigures under a peaked roof. This piece\nsuggested the feeling of entrapment\nfor women, perhaps being in a male-dominated environment. Hmm\u2026\nseems somewhat familiar. I wonder if\nMu\u00f1oz visited Imperial College during\nhis time in London.\nThe Wasteland (1987) was Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s\nfirst large-scale exhibit, inspired by the\npoem of the same name by T.S Eliot.\nThe Wasteland is a very dramatic composition of a statue and space which\ninfluenced David Lynch\u2019s Twin Peaks.\nAs you enter the room, at the far side is\na small bronze figure, sitting tight on a\nlittle iron shelf sticking out of the wall\ntoo high for his dangling feet to touch\nthe ground. But between you and him,\nthe patterned floor is an image composed solely of interlocking cubes. You\nfeel inclined to walk across this disori-entating surface rather uncertainly. In\nthe process you yourself become an involuntary performer in the work. You\ndon't know whether to view the frozen\nlittle man, with his feet in the air, as the\nprisoner of this room, or its master. It\ncould even be a spell he has cast on the\nspace around him which you may cross\nat your own peril.\nBy far the best exhibit was Many\ntimes (1999) which is a room full of a\nhundred slightly under life-size grinning bald Chinese figures, all with the\nsame head and facial expression. The\nhead was derived from a Belgian art\nnouveau bust. Mu\u00f1oz choreographed\nsingle and multiple groups standing\naround as if they were locked in con-versation. However, the bodies hold\nsuch varied postures and gesticulations that you can't quite believe the\nheads are all identical. Also, none of\nthe figures have feet: they stand on the\nfloor cut off at their trouser bottoms.\nIt\u2019s like the \u2018living statues\u2019 you encounter in Covent Garden: are they real or\nare they not? It\u2019s interesting having\nwalked into the room, but you feel like\nyou are surrounded by people laughing and engaged in silent conversation.\nThe scale of the work is astounding\nand outnumbers the viewer, making\nyou feel strange and isolated among\nthem, almost as if you have become the\nexhibit on display.\nOther pieces such as Shadow and\nmouth (1996) created a sinister atmos-phere, almost like an interrogation\nscene out of a Film Noir with one figure sitting in front of a table and another against the wall. The mouth of the\nshadow moves slowly and discretely. It\nis almost as if the figure is whispering\nall his secrets to the wall. The Dwarf\nand three columns (1988) is exactly\nwhat the title states, three large column\ntowers made of terracota arranged in a\nsquare, but with the fourth column being replaced by a dwarf. Here Mu\u00f1oz\nis using the human form as an archi-tectual element as well, perhaps making a statement about how you can be\noverwhelmed by society making you\nfeel diminutive at times.\nApparently Mu\u00f1oz liked making\nthe viewer look upwards to look at his\nwork. In this case it was to look at The\nRotating Hanging figures (1997).

There\nwere also some less thought-provoking\nworks such as his 40 Raincoat draw-ings, which were basically different\nperspective chalk drawings of the interior of his house as his mother had an\naffinity for feng shui.\nThere were also the Crossroads cabinets (1999) which from a great distance look like dazzling glass trophy\nshowcases which you\u2019d love to have in\nyour living room until you realize they\ncontains disparate objects and freaks\nof nature such as switch-blade knives,\nminiature doors, locks and miniature\ncasts of resin body parts.\nOverall through the highly considered placement of the figures, Mu\u00f1oz\nentices the viewer into an engagement\nwith the implied narrative unravelling\nwithin. Mu\u00f1oz used tricks of perspective and scale to create a tension between the illusory and the real.

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFriday 9 May 2008 felix\nComment\nJaimie Henry\nYou might be blind\nT\nhis week, London has\nelected a new mayor. I\u2019ll\nbe honest with you: I don\u2019t\nlike him at all, and I was\nmuch more in favour of\nKen. But something rather curious\nhappened during these elections \u2013 people actually voted. A record turnout of\naround 45% was both unprecedented\nand unusual.\nSo surely this is a good thing? Democracy is working, right? It seems to\nbe happening everywhere \u2013 even in the\nrecent ICU Sabb elections, normally\nthe hotbed of apathy (if there is such\na thing) voter turnout was at a record\nhigh. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m really happy this has happened.\nBut somewhat paradoxically, this\nis where we are now left with a problem in the mythical beast that makes\nup this new and shocking voter turn-out: the \u201caverage person.\u201d But surely\nwhen it comes to democracy, there is\nno such thing as an average? One man,\none vote; voting for one party and one\nideal, no?\nWell, I suppose so, but take average\nas a person on the street with no particular political affiliation. This \u201caverage voter\u201d has always had a protective\neffect on British democracy. It is this\nmythical being that prevents extremist\nparties coming to power by flooding\nthe system with their supporters and\noutnumbering the relatively centric\nviews of the rest of humanity.\nThis is why, despite all the hysterical\njournalistic rhetoric that is inevitable\nwith an election, the BNP and other\nextreme parties generally fail to win\nseats, or at least never enough to create\nanything apart from a passing feeling\nof disgust in the pit of your stomach. It\nis the same effect that gives legitimacy\nto governments with a large turnout or\nmay label them both unrepresentative\nand radical with the opposite. But it is\nat best concerning that in this powerful friend we have created a very dangerous foe.\nBefore I go any further, I want to\nclear up that I know that democracy\nis, by definition, the choice to vote for\nwhichever party you want. If that is the\nMonster Raving Looney Party, then\nso be it. But we are entering the era of\nblind democracy. I might not like Boris,\nbut I have to admire the brilliance of\nhis PR machine. Our average voters\nsee this charismatic buffoon, and vote\nfor him for every reason they can think\nof except for his manifesto. I\u2019ve heard\npeople voice support for him because\nhe \u201cjokes,\u201d and these people upon interrogation have no idea of his policies\nor past. Other rationales include seeing\nhim on TV, or thinking his behaviour\nis hapless and amusing, and would like\nto see the aftermath of this in office.\nPeople apparently voted against Ken\nbecause he has a nasally voice or was\nugly, not because he was a bad mayor.\nIn the Union elections, voting for the\nfittest girl is certainly not unheard of\n\u2013 good looks do not help you run any\nform of government. Maggie taught us\nthat much.\nI know people tend to vote right\nwhen there\u2019s economic instability, and\nthat people apparently wanted to punish Labour over the whole 10p tax fi-asco; tbut Ken could hardly have been\nsaid to have been a New Labour lap-dog. It serves to prove the point that\npeople either don\u2019t know or care about\nthe Mayoral remit if they\u2019re judging\ncandidates on national issues on which\nthe Mayor has no control.\nFacebook has a lot to answer for. Until recently I didn\u2019t think I could add\n\u201cvoter intimidation\u201d to that. Viral marketing may be spreading the word of\ndemocracy, in much the same way as I\ndo when I drag people out to vote late\nat night whilst screaming party propaganda at them. But I fear people have\nstarted to vote from other people\u2019s statuses and flashy application logos. This\nis not informed decision making; this\nis displaying the intellectual rigour and\nquestioning mind of a farm animal.\nIt had got to the stage where I had to\npimp my profile with pro-Ken rhetoric\njust to feel like I was ever going to get\nthrough to people. Why is this different from posters and billboards? Because the 20ft head of Boris Johnson\non a billboard won\u2019t on its own make\nyou vote for him, whereas a picture of\nyour best friend shaking hands with\nhim on the same billboard might just\ndo the trick.\nTo top it all off, one of my friends\nsupposedly voted for Boris to \u201ccancel\nout\u201d my vote for Ken. Please listen to\nme very carefully: This is not a game.\nWe are not on Have I Got News for\nYou. You are playing with the single\nmost powerful thing you have in your\npossession, so give it some respect and\nuse it wisely. Of course you can vote for\nwho you want \u2013 and I really want you\nto. Read up on the candidates, support\nsomeone because you believe in their\ncause or manifesto, and don\u2019t be fooled\nby the persona, bumbling or otherwise.\nOtherwise, extremism is just around\nthe corner.\nThe BNP mayoral candidate, Richard Barnbrook, now sits on the London Assembly, having gained over 70\n000 votes. This is most likely not because we are suddenly becoming very\nxenophobic and nationalistic, but because this clean-cut character is comparatively personable and not an overt\nracist they have pulled the wool over\npeople\u2019s eyes.\nI thought it was common knowledge\nthe BNP were racist bastards, but apparently a change of image does won-ders. I sincerely doubt there are 69,000\npeople in this City who would advocate the kind of \u201cbehind the camera\u201d\nracist violence the BNP advocate, as\nexposed in a recent BBC documentary.\nThis probably happened thanks to a\npublic ignorance and a well-oiled PR\nmachine, a la Boris Johnson. What\u2019s\nmore worrying here is that whilst people have no idea whether or not Boris\nis incompetent, they should know this\nman is the bedrock of prejudice and\ndiscrimination. This is the endpoint of\nthe slippery slope we are falling down;\nvoting for Boris or Ken without knowing much about them is one thing,\nvoting for the BNP is quite another. If\nI have got it all wrong, and people are\nbecoming well-informed BNP sup-porters, then I weep for humanity.\nI\u2019m not saying you are all average\nvoters; the esteemed readers of this\nfine publication will no doubt be remarkably well informed. Indeed, students tend to be among some of the\nmore active and sensible voters. And\nhopefully this is a minority of voters,\nalbeit growing rather rapidly. But it is\nyour civic duty to inform the ignorant\u2013\nand goodness knows there are many of\nthem \u2013 about why they should know\nwhat they\u2019re voting for, and you are\nso culpable if you allow this travesty\nto continue under your noses. Please\ndon\u2019t allow this na\u00efvete to continue\nin 2010, when much bigger things are\nat stake. Power and responsibility are\nindeed inextricably linked. Spiderman\nmay have been an idiot, but his Uncle\nhad a good point.\nIC students\u2019 views on the elections\nBoris Johnson\u2019s appointment as Mayor of London has caused quite a stir amongst the student body, but\nperhaps not quite as much as a BNP member, Richard Barnbrook, winning a seat on the London Assembly\n\u201c\nSupport\nsomeone\nbecause you\nbelieve in their\ncause, and don\u2019t\nbe fooled by the\npersona\n\u201d\n\u201c\nI thought it\nwas common\nknowledge the\nBNP were racist\nbastards\nApparently, telling jokes can get you into the London Mayor\u2019s office\nPlease think seriously about who you\u2019re voting for in 2010...\n\n"

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFriday 9 May 2008 felix\nPolitics\nment, although the question of implementation remains, Beijing has passed\naggressive environmental legislations,\nrecently upgrading the environment\nbureau into a full ministry. In the me-dia, despite intermittent periods of\ntightening control, there is the undeniable trend that the press is gradually\nfreed up. Although the media industry is still self-censored, many private\nmedia enterprise are now competing\ndirectly with state-owned ones. Moreover, the BBC website and Wikipedia\nare now unblocked in China ahead of\nthe Games (amid the Tibetan riots), so\nreaders in China have no problem of\ngetting a more balanced view. Furthermore, China\u2019s hosting the Games is really a positive influence on its leaders.\nThe unreasonable demand to boycott\nit, would only isolate the regime, deepen Beijing\u2019s suspicion of the west and\ngive the right-wing hardliners reasons\nto implement tighter control.\nThe vast cultural differences are also\na major reason in our different ways\nof thinking. We Chinese believe that\nD\nespite having attended\nthe recent protests in\nLondon along the route\nof the Olympic Torch\nRelay, remembering the\nexpressions on the faces of some of the\npeople on those vans and buses as they\nwere booed and jeered has made me\nthink twice about what I did. Seeing\npeople hired solely to drive buses, coordinate the procession, or even simply\nto dance in short shorts on the back of\na van shrink back as protesters chanted\n\u201cshameonyou\u201dandthrewtwo-fingered\nsalutes at them aroused thoughts as to\nwhether politics are really relevant in\na global gathering meant to celebrate\nhuman achievement through sport.\nIndeed, the goal of Olympism, according to the Olympic Charter, the\ngoverning document of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is\n\u201cto place sport at the service of the\nharmonious development of man, with\na view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of\nhuman dignity.\u201d Thus, it seems ironic\nthat Beijing was chosen as the host\ncity of the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, it being the capital of a country\nrenowned for human rights abuses,\nnot only in Tibet, but in the Xingjiang\nUyghur Autonomous Region, home to\nalmost 9 million Muslim Uyghurs, as\nwell as for its support of other autocratic regimes, such as that of Burma,\nwhere the recent Saffron Revolution\nwas denounced by the Chinese press,\nand that of Zimbabwe, of which China\nis the largest arms supplier.\nDespite Chin\u2019as immaculate human\nrights record, when the IOC met in\nMoscow in 2001 to choose a host city\nfor 2008, the IOC Evaluation Commission wrote in their report for the committee delegates that when choosing a\nhost city \u201cit is impossible to ignore the\ndebate on political issues, such as human rights\u201d, but that it would \u201cnot deal\nwith this issue other than to acknowledge the existence of the debate and its\ncontinuation\u201d.\nFurthermore, in the Olympic Charter, it is written that \u201cany form of discrimination with regard to a country\nor person on grounds of race, religion,\npolitics, gender or otherwise in incompatible with belonging to the Olympic\nMovement\u201d, meaning that ignoring\nBeijing\u2019s bid to host the Games simply\ndue to their political stances means\nviolating the Charter.\nIndeed, it is stated clearly in the Olympic Charter that \u201cno kind of demonstration or religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic\nsites,\u201d which, one could argue, should\neliminate any opportunity for the po-liticisation of the Olympic Games.\nHowever, governments in the past\nhave made huge political statements\nwhile still abiding by this rule.\nStarting with the Melbourne Games\nof 1956, when seven nations refused\nto attend because of the Suez Crisis,\nthe Soviet invasion of Hungary, and\nTaiwan\u2019s participation under the name\nof Formosa. Of course, it was this\nyear\u2019s host nation that was protesting\nthe third. China boycotted the Olympics again in 1980, when 62 countries\njoined the USA in expressing their\ndisapproval of the host nation\u2019s \u2013 the\nUSSR\u2019s \u2013 invasion of Afghanistan.\nQuite ironically, despite its record of\npolitical activism in the games of the\npast, the People\u2019s Republic has recently\nbeen one of the strongest advocates for\na completely neutral Olympics. Their\nForeign Ministry spokesperson, Jiang\nYu, remarked that any group wanting\nto \u201ctake the world people\u2019s grand event\nas a stage for a political show, [has]\nfound a wrong place, and will only ask\nfor insult.\u201d\nNevertheless, some world leaders\nhave declined their invitation to attend the opening ceremony in August,\nincluding Gordon Brown, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, Prince\nCharles, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel; but many of them told the\npress that they had never intended to\ngo in the first place. French President\nNicolas Sarkozy, however, has neither\nconfirmed nor declined his place at the\nopening ceremony, but the country\u2019s\nSecretary of State for Human Rights,\nRama Yad,e was reported to have laid\ndown the conditions of Sarkozy\u2019s at-tendance: \u201can end to violence against\nthe population and the release of political prisoners, light to be shed on the\nevents in Tibet and the opening of dialogue with the Dalai Lama\u201d. Furthermore, the Japanese Royal Family has\ndecided not to attend, citing not only\nTibetan unrest, but also a dispute over\ngas fields claimed by both countries,\nand the poisoning of 10 Japanese by\ndumplings imported from China.\nThe Dalai Lama, however, has consistently been against any boycott,\ndeclaring his stance on NBC Nightly\nNews in April, saying that any politicians\u2019 attendance of the opening ceremony is \u201cup to them\u201d. He has also said\nthat he believes that China \u201cdeserve[s]\nto host the famous games, as it is the\nmost populous nation of the world\u201d,\nending any doubt as to whether Tibetans that view the Dalai Lama as their\npolitical leader should support the\nIOC\u2019s decision to host the Games in\nBeijing.\nNevertheless, many people have protested against China, questioning the\nIOC\u2019s choice on the idea that a country\nMixing Politics and the Olympics\nCarlos Joaquin Karingal discusses whether the Olympics should serve as a political platform\nwith such a questionable human rights\nrecord should not be allowed to host an\nevent seen as a celebration of \u201chuman\ndignity\u201d, to quote the Olympic Charter. In addition, their chants of \u201cChina,\nChina,China!Out!Out!Out!\u201dand\u201cHuman rights in Tibet!\u201d showed that they\nwere also protesting simply for Tibetan\nindependence, which has been an issue on people\u2019s minds since the 1950\u2019s\nat least, well before Beijing submitted\nits bid to become an Olympic host city.\nThus, the protesters simply seized the\nopportunity to make themselves heard\nat a time when all eyes were on them,\nwhich they have done many times in\nthe past. When former Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited London in\n1999, pro-Tibetan protesters gathered\noutside Buckingham Palace, where\nJiang was having a state banquet with\nthe Queen. Similar demonstrations occurred in 2004 around Downing Street\nwhile the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao,\nmet with Tony Blair. Past incidents,\nhowever, seem not to have exceeded\nthose surrounding this year\u2019s torch re-lay, where we saw about 2500 people\ngather for the cause in London alone,\nshowing that the protesters capitalised\non the fact that simply more people are\ninterested in the Olympic Games than\na state visit, so the media surrounding\nthe relay gave activists a perfect platform from which to make their voices\nheard.\nSo the people on the streets, voicing\ntheir anger over China\u2019s policies are\nnot without reason, but while I am glad\nI took a stand for the rights of people\nin need of help, I regret booing and\nmaking less-than-savoury gestures at\nthe dancers and the bus drivers. Sure,\nI disagree with the way China has\nhandled Tibet and Burma, and I vehemently oppose their oppression of\nthe Falun Gong, and I would take any\nopportunity to let people know, but I\ndon\u2019t think that the man driving the\nvan should be punished for it.These\nare all political issues, and the Olympics are about sport. It has been said\nthat the Ancient Greeks put their differences aside in times of war to compete in the Olympics. Whether or not\nthat is true, I think it is an admirable\nexample, and should be emulated. Let\nthe athletes compete, and the Chinese\ncelebrate the Games. After August we\ncan talk.\n\u201cThe Dalai Lama\nhas consistently\nbeen against any\nboycott\u201d\nwe shouldn\u2019t meddle in other people\u2019s\nbusiness, and we expect the others to\ntreat us the same. Many of you say that\nTibet is not a Chinese domestic issue.\nMaybe it is or maybe it is not. The important thing is we are deeply suspicious of the western countries\u2019 motivation in getting involved. This suspicion\nis deeply branded into our psyche,\nbecause our relationship with the west\nhas not always been one of friendship.\nChina used to be a great power; its decline in global status was worsened by\nwestern imperialism and colonialism.\nThe looting and burning of our prized\nImperial Old Summer Palace by Britain and France, the sacking of Peking\n(Beijing) by the western Eight Nations\nAlliance is still taught in our textbooks\nand remembered as the symbol of\nthe humiliation China suffered at the\nhands of the West.\nI disagree with the people who dwell\non the past to justify their blind na-tionalism. But in their shoes, you can\nsee why they drift so easily into an\nultra-nationalist mood. Under the current government, for the first time in\nover a century China is strong, stable\nand united, under no threat of civil war\nwhile building a thriving economy. We\nmay not have freedom of speech, but\nwe do treasure the most fundamental\nhuman right \u2013 the right to live in peace\nwithout the fear of turmoil. In a world\nwhere the majority of the people live\nin poverty, in fear or in war, we Chinese people don\u2019t for on second take\nit for granted. This is why we support\na strong government while subconsciously we question the motivation\nbehind the West\u2019s \u201crequest\u201d to improve\nChina\u2019s human rights.\nOf course we want our government\nto be more transparent and we want\nmore rights, but we also believe in pa-tience. We believe in constructive criticism and gradual changes. I believe ultimately all people in China will have\nmore freedom, much more freedom.\nI accept other people have different\nopinions, but we all want the best for\nChina, just in different ways.\nOn a final note, most of you would\nsay this is not about China but about\nTibet. I say, considering the political\nreality in China, and the positions of\nthose involved, Tibetan independence\nis not a realisable solution. The question remains, how to get the best out\nof the current situation. I suggest you\nread Kadhim\u2019s article carefully and\nthen form your own opinion as to how\nbest to go forward.\nThe banners used by pro-Tibetan protestors mix secessionist politics and human rights issues\nThe mascots of the Beijing Olympics. Look - there\u2019s a panda!\n\n"

However, not all of his patrons\nwere British. The unique horizontal\nframed portrait of \u2018Duchess Gerolama\nSantacroce Conti\u2019 is completely gor-geous. She relaxes in her elegant chair\nwhile doing her toilette and draping\npearls in a dish while her see-through\nnightdress, or peignoir, is lazily un-done. PHWOAR! This is nothing like\nthe rest of the portrait. Her dirty husband commissioned this portrait of\nhis wife-to be and it was hung in their\nprivate sexy-time bedchamber above\nthe door. Kinky or what? Apparently,\nthe curator had great fun hanging this\non the same wall as a painting entitled\n\u2018Meekness\u2019.\nThe fourth room is full of the grandest Grand Tourists, and we see those\nhuge life-size \u2018swagger portraits\u2019 that\ngrace the Great Halls in stately homes.\nYummy. It should be noted that these\nGrand Tourists were absolutely despised by the locals. They were rowdy,\ndrank too much and were very arro-gant. That\u2019s right, guys. Brits Abroad\nhaven\u2019t changed one bit these last 300\nyears.\nThe most arrogant of the \u2018swagger\nportraits\u2019 is \u2018Colonel the Hon. William\nGordon\u2019. From the way Batoni has portrayed him, he is the embodiment of\nScotland. He is swathed in tartan like a\ntoga and his pose is very martial, grand\nand overconfident. You can imagine\nhim bashing his way into Batoni\u2019s studio and rudely asking for his portrait\nto be done in an incomprehensible\nScottish accent. I love the way Batoni\nhas positioned a ruined version of the\nColiseum in the landscape, as though\nColonel Gordon has demolished it\nhimself.\nMost of these Grand Tourists were\ndepicted in Roman surroundings, with\ntheir hand placed strategically on an\nancient artefact or bust. However, the\n6th Duke of Gordon was a special case.\nAt first, he was achingly excited about\ngoing to Europe - he hired the best\nguide and paid for all his comforts to\ncome with him. But when he actually\ngot round to going he refused point\nblank to get out of his carriage! Fortunately, he did manage to ask Batoni for\na portrait, although he shouldn\u2019t have\nbothered. Maybe out of spite, Batoni\npainted The Duke as if he were hunting\nback home in the Scottish Highlands!\n\u201cBloody tourists\u201d, he would have said.\nAs he got older, Batoni got more and\nmore frank with his portraits, dispensing completely with flattery. If you\nBack in the day, The Sartorialist didn\u2019t exist. So you stood like a statue\nfor about a month while some noob did the hard work. But it was all\ntotally worth it, as evidenced here\nSo basically this is what the Felix office looks like half the time, avec nakedness\n\u201cher see-through\nnightdress,\nor peignoir, is\nlazily undone.\nPHWOAR!\u201d\nwere ugly, he wasn\u2019t going to change\nthat fact on canvas. The last room of\nthe exhibition demonstrates this, along\nwith the more intimate and sensitive\ncharacterisations of the sitters. These\nportraits are very life-like and likeable.\nIt is evident when Batoni liked his sitter\nif he depicts them looking intelligent\nor lively. In addition, his mood was\nobviously lightened by the retreat of\nthe Grand Tourists in the 1780s when\nwar in France between the French and\nEnglish prevented much tourism. The\nportrait of Louisa Grenville is the most\nsparkling portrait in the entire exhibi-tion. According to Ms A. Guide, \u201cshe\nwas the most amiable person who ever\nlived\u201d, and Batoni confirms this in her\nbubbly depiction.\nThis exhibition marks the 300th\nanniversary of Batoni\u2019s birth and is a\nmajor achievement in terms of reviving a long-forgotten artist. Many of\nthese paintings have been cleaned and\nrestored for the exhibition and they\nlook incredibly fresh as if they had\nbeen painted yesterday. The curators\nare also very proud of the fact they\nhave \u2018freed\u2019 a lot of these paintings\nfrom private collections, especially the\nbeautiful Marriage of Saint Catherine.\nThis painting meant a lot to Batoni\nbecause he apparently modelled the\nSaints Catherine and Lucy on his two\nex-wives. It has been kept in a dark\ncorner of the Italian Presidential palace\nfor years and it\u2019s great that it manages\nto get a good airing at this exhibition. I\nloved the exhibition, despite the rather\ngrey, empty atmosphere in the gallery.\nIt is a real unique opportunity to see\nhis paintings; I recommend swaggering along and having a nosey!\nPompeo Batoni is on until 18th\nMay. It costs \u00a34 with your Imperial card and if you don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll\nset Achilles on your ass.\n\u201cBatoni got more\nand more frank\nwith his portraits,\ndispensing\ncompletely with\nflattery.\u201d\n\n"

This figure will mean a similar total force in Iraq\nas was present before President Bush\u2019s \u2018surge\u2019 last year.

THE\nONLY THING REQUIRED OF YOU\nIN AN EXAM IS TO SIT IN A CHAIR\nFOR 3 HOURS AND REGURGITATE\nA SMALL PORTION OF KNOWLEDGE, YOU WORRYING SHITS.\nDear Needy McNeedy\nThis might make me sound sluttish, but\nduring Fresher\u2019s Week, I had a one-night\nstand with a really hot guy who I met at\nthe union. I knew he wasn\u2019t a fresher,\nbut I didn\u2019t know what department he\nwas in. It was fun, but we didn\u2019t take\nit further than that \u2013 just a one-night\nthing, you know? I\u2019m now in my second year, and have just been assigned\na massive project.

Do you have any tips\nfor dealing with ex one-night stands?\nCreamPie\nDear CreamPie,\nOh dear. The crucial thing in this is\nthat he will probably grade you on your\nperformance in bed.

If you\nvomited on him, or kneed him in the\nballs accidently, then get revising for\nthose exams; you\u2019re going to need to\nmake up the extra marks somewhere! If\nneither of you decided to make contact\nwith each other after the event, then\nexpect the worse, although given that\nyou were just some random Fresher,\nyou can hope that he just can\u2019t remember anything about that night.\nNeedy xxx\nDear Needy McNeedy,\nI found a 50p coin down the drain the\nother day.

Glorious days of immeasurable bliss, of sitting\nin Hyde Park, chilling out\nand having music on full blast. Music\nat this time of the year may be palpably soothing and stress-releasing for\nthose who are stuck in a haze of exam\npreparations, or for individuals who\nhave already jumped the big hurdles;\nwell, there is no better time than now\nto party away. Rock and roll!!\nThis summery train of thought has\ninevitably got me thinking of summer\ngrooves. Songs that get us on our feet or\nsimply sweet melodies reminiscent of\npast summers and the delicious memories of letting oneself go and getting\nhigh on cloud nine. For me, \u2018Mambo\nNumber 5\u2019,\u2019 by Lou Bega and \u2018\u2018Dancing\nin the Moonlight\u2019 by Toploader epito-mise fun and laughter on hot summer\ndays. I can almost hear the ice cream\nvan purring in the distance...\nAlternatively, both \u2018Summer Son\u2019 and\n\u2018Inner Smile\u2019 by Texas as well as the\nbrilliant New Radical\u2019s sensation \u2018You\nGet What You Give\u2019 catapult me back\nto my high school summer vacations,\nwhere the pinnacle of life was pure en-joyment. Good old days. In contrast,\n\u2018Crazy in love\u2019 by the one and only Beyonce paints a passion-fuelled picture\nof the intoxiating nature of summer\nromances, of falling head over heels. In\nlove or daydreaming perhaps...\nThe other day, I discovered a hidden\ngem in my iTunes library that I had totally ignored. A crime against Mother\nMusic. Apologies. Basically, I had been\ngiven the first Scissor Sisters album\nand, as you do, imported it into my\nmusic library without really exploring\nwhat the music had to offer. It was by\nchance that I had an afternoon off one\nday that I decided to have a quick lie-down and chose to play the album. And\ngosh, Scissor Sisters are mindblow-ingly AWESOME! Previously, I had\nheard a few of the band\u2019s tracks on the\nradio and did fall for the resoundingly\nbittersweet \u2018Mary\u2019, as well as taking a\nstrong liking for feel-good anthems\nlike \u2018Take Your Mama,\u2019 \u2018Laura\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018I Don\u2019t Feel like Dancing.\u2019 But what\nreally captured my soul was \u2018It Can\u2019t\nCome Quickly Enough.\u2019 A rather biz-zare and ambiguous title but you cannot help but be entranced by vocalist\nJake Shears\u2019 breathtaking intonations,\nthe exquisite melody and powerful lyr-ics. If you haven\u2019t given Scissor Sisters\na shot, man, you are seriously missing\nout big time.\nEven though Goldfrapp\u2019s new album \u2018Seventh Tree\u2019 has already come\nout this February, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too\nlate to give the album a whirl, so I have\nrightly included a belated album review for you readers. In addition, my\ncolleague in honour has supplied us\nwith a \u2018Cage the Elephant\u2019 interview.\nDon\u2019t ask questions. \u2018Tis very long. But\nsimply read and relish!\nWe\u2019ve got a mountain of CDs\nsent to us over the holidays, and\nthere\u2019s always gigs that need\ngoing to. If you fancy getting\nsome free stuff, give us an email\nat music.felix@gmail.com\nThe two guitarists, Lincoln Parish and\nBrad Shultz from Cage the Elephant\ngave Felix the pleasure of talking to\nthem.\nTell me about yourselves.\nB: We\u2019re from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Small town, There\u2019s only about\n60 thousand people there at the most.\nIt\u2019s a college town.\nL: There\u2019s nothing really to do there.\nB: That\u2019s why we got into music.\nL: No, there\u2019s actually a lot of really\ngood musicians who\u2019ve come out of\nBowling Green over the years. It\u2019s kind\nof bizarre. It\u2019s always had a good history\nfor good musicians and good bands.\nLike who?\nB: Well, nobody notable. This guy\nnamed Bobby Baldwin who toured\nwith the Band of Gypsies and Eric\nClapton and Santana.\nL: He actually taught me guitar for a\ncouple years.\nB: He\u2019s fuckin\u2019 badass.\nL: I got a volume pedal on my wall that\nwas Carlos Santana\u2019s from this guy.\nHe\u2019s always been in rock and roll, then\nhe came back home and decided to\nstraighten his life out so he became a\npreacher.\nB: That\u2019s what everyone does in our\ntown. We live in the Bible Belt.\nL: The Bible Belt consciousness got\nto him and he decided to come back\nhome.\nI\u2019ve read that one or more of you\ngrew up on a Christian Hippy\nComune\nB: That would be Tichenor. He was\nborn on it, and my dad lived there with\nhis dad. They were hippies and my dad\nalways played music. He was in a few\nbands \u2013 one started to get big but then\nhis drummer got killed in a crash, so\nthen he turned real Christian and they\nlive on this big Christian hippy commune thing, and they all sat down and\nplayed Christian music together.\nHow did that all work, how\ndid \u2018Christian\u2019 and \u2018hippy\u2019 go\ntogether?\nL: It\u2019s kind of you know, the last strain\nof hippies who found Jesus through\nacid. Jesus Freaks they call them, back\nin the States. Somehow they found\nGod through all that stuff.\nAre you guys religious?\nB: I\u2019m religious to the point where I\nbelieve in God and Jesus and all that\nstuff, but it\u2019s not the institution that\npeople make it. Church, it\u2019s been for\nseveral hundred, maybe even since it\ngot started\u2026it hasn\u2019t been the same\never since someone found out they\ncould make money off religion that\u2019s\nwhen it started going down the shit-ter. I\u2019m not saying that every church or\nthat everybody is that way, but Church\nhas become a big business now.\nL: It\u2019s more a social thing, than people\ngoing there for religious reasons.\nB: Back in the day, Christianity was\nmystical. People met in caves in secret,\nand you could get killed for doing it,\nit was like the rebels. Not that I think\nnow people should be meeting in caves\nor anything, but people should still be\nwanting to learn about stuff, not just\n\u201cOh I\u2019m here, I\u2019m being seen. Everybody look at me putting money into\nthe bag\u201d.\nL: Seriously, no joke. Down in the south\nif you don\u2019t give money to the church\npeople will look at you in a completely\ndifferent way. You\u2019ll get evil looks.\nB: People who take the pastor out to\ndinner and they think they\u2019re special\nfor one day. How the hell does that\nmake it special?\nL: The preacher\u2019s not God.\nB: Yeah not shit. If you said you were\ntaking Jesus out for lunch or something you know..props!\nYou seem kind of cynical about it.\nB: We\u2019re cynical about it becoming an\ninstitution but you know, the religion\n\u2013 I have faith in what I have faith in. I\nwon\u2019t go around forcing it on people.\nCan you describe your music for\npeople who havn\u2019t heard it?\nL: Rock and roll, punk, funk, whatever\nwe come up with\nWhat kind of bands did you listen\nto as kids?\nL: A lot of us weren\u2019t allowed to listen\nto much\nB: Me and Matt and Titchner were only\nallowed to listen to Christian music as\nyoung kids. Of course, I snuck a Jimi\nHendrix tape into the house. And my\ndad, if he was feeling real good man, in\na real good mood, he\u2019d put on some Joe\nCocker or some Pink Floyd or some\nSteppenwolf.\nL: I had an Eminem CD that I\u2019d bought\nwhen I was like 10 years old. I\u2019d been\nhiding it in my room under some\nclothes, and my mom went to clean my\nroom and was going through my shit\nand found it. She was like \u201cYou do not\nneed to be listening to this\u201d. She threw\nit away and I cried. This was the Marshall Mathers LP. When I was 13 and\nI\u2019d been playing guitar for about a year,\nmy dad went out and bought me the\nLed Zeppelin \u2018Early and Latter Days\u2019,\nthe two disk thing. So that was the first\ntime I really heard rock and roll like\nthat. It was cool.\nB: Me and Matt got into rock and roll\nthrough sneaking it. Then our parents\ngot divorced when were about 13, 14.\nOnce they got divorced, everything\nstarted being\u2026I dunno, they just kind\nof loostened up a little bit. They had\nother stuff to worry about. And we\u2019d\nplay the two sides against the other.\n\u201cMom let\u2019s me do it\u201d so dad was like\n\u201cWell fuck it!\u201d you know? Then we just\ngot into a bunch of music after that.\nWe were discovering all these new\nbands for the first time. It was weird\nbecause it was like we were discovering them on our own \u2013 we\u2019d go to\nour friends and be like \u201cOh my God,\nhave you heard of this band the Talking Heads, they\u2019re so badass\u201d, and they\nwere all like \u201cDude, everybody knows\nwho the fucking Talking Heads are\u201d\nL: Once you open that door it\u2019s like a\nwhole new world to you. It\u2019s just so cool\nbe exposed to music like that when\nyou\u2019ve never heard anything like it.\nWhat kind of music are you into\nnowadays?\nL: All kinds of stuff\nB: Jimi Hendrix, Rolling Stones, Pink\nFloyd\nL: A lot of old stuff, but also a lot of\nnew bands. Everybody in the band is\nalways trying to find a really hip new\nband who are on the cutting edge. You\nwanna be doing something that nobody else is doing so you need to see\nwhat everybody else is doing.\nB: Bands nowadays, we like The Yeah\nYeah Yeahs, Tokyo Police Club, The\nWhite Stripes, The Raconteurs.\nL: There\u2019s a lot of bands that we\u2019ll play\nwith on the road that we\u2019ll find nobody else knows of. There\u2019s this band\ncalled Mason Proper, they\u2019re really\nsick. There\u2019s all kind of cool bands you\ncan discover that nobody else knows\nabout. Like that band Illenios.\nB: Yeah Illenois, they\u2019re supposed to\nbe Jack White\u2019s new favourite band\nor something. A buddy of ours knows\nJack White\u2019s tour manager, who\u2019s the\nguy that turned him on to Illenois.\nL: Autovaughn, they\u2019re killer live. We\nsaw them play in Austin and they put\non one of the best shows. They killed\nit. Brad was so wasted he got up on\nstage and like, trashed the stage.\nB: They\u2019re buddies of ours. I was standing in the front row rocking out and\nDarren came over and head-butted\nme in the head and pushed his head\nagainst mine so I pushed him back\ninto the stage, and then they were just\nrocking out so I just got up on stage\nand started kicking the drums, it was\ncrazy as fuck. The whole stage was just\ndestroyed. This was at a place called\nChuggin\u2019 Monkey.\nWhat kind of places do you like to\nplay in?\nL: Playing small little shithole bars\nback him that hold about 200 people,\nand there\u2019s 350 people in there sweating their asses off, breaking everything,\nit doesn\u2019t get much better than that.\nCage the Elephant\nAn uncaged elephant\n\n"

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFriday 9 May 2008 felix\nScience\nC\nould geoengineering - altering\nglobal climate using technology\n- be the \u201cmagic bullet\u201d to cure\nEarth\u2019s rising fever?\n[One] idea is to fire hundreds of\nrockets loaded with compressed sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere to\ncreate a vast but thin \u201csulphur sunscreen\u201d, which would behave like a suntan lotion for our planet, increasing its\nalbedo, or reflectivity. Such an idea may\nchime of the same bells as a big budget\nscience fiction film, but let us not be so\ndismissive. The famous volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 provides evidence for this proposal which\nis the brainchild of Professor Paul\nCrutzen, Nobel Prize winner in 1995\nfor his work on the ozone layer. Twenty million tonnes of sulphur dioxide\nwere thrust 20km into the atmosphere\nwhere the particulates remained as a\nthin veil for years, spreading around\nthe Earth to lower global temperatures\nby a sizeable 0.6\u00b0C. The major setback\nof this strategy: the simultaneous part-destruction of the ozone.\n[Another idea is] fertilising the\nEarth\u2019s oceans with iron to increase\nphytoplankton activity, thus raising\ntheir \u201ccarbon sink\u201d capacity. In the lat-ter, trials by SOFeX scientists in the\nSouthern Ocean have been successful\nin initiating massive phytoplankton\nblooms which acted as an effective carbon reservoir and boosted ecosystems.\nGlobal warming and the fishing crisis\nsolved in one fell swoop? [...]\nCynics may recoil at the astronomical expense of a sulphur Sun shield\nor gigantic orbiting parasol, and most\nadvocates of geoengineering schemes\nwould concede that they might not\nrepresent the complete answer- but\nthey could bide us the time needed to\nheal our planet, whatever the cost.\nAli Tasleem\nW\nhilst genes do play a fundamental role in character, it\nhas been shown that environment \u2013 particularly during developmental stages \u2013 is often far more\nsignificant.\nFor instance it has been shown that\nchildren with a mutated (under-repeat-ed) promoter region of the monoamine\noxidase A (MAOA) gene are far more\nlikely than average to commit acts of\nviolence, but only if they are abused\nwhile young.2 Therefore it would be\nunethical to criminally penalise or\ncounsel an individual merely on the\nbasis that they carried this mutation.\nA \u2018bad\u2019 genotype therefore is not a\nsentence; it also requires a bad environment to create an undesirable phe-nome. Yet just one little diagnostic test,\nof the promoter length in this one gene,\ncould allow a physician to predict, with\nsome confidence, whether one is likely\nto be antisocial or probably criminal.\nJames Stillit & Sascha Alles\nS\nome geo-engineering techniques\nattack the root of the problem,\ncarbondioxide,headon.Artificial\ntrees which, like real trees, can absorb\ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nare an option. A solution of sodium\nhydroxide flows through the trees and\nabsorbs carbon dioxide forming sodium carbonate. However, in order to\nrelease carbon dioxide, the carbonate\nmust be heated, which, unless a green\nenergy source is used, would undo the\neffort made to collect the gas in the\nfirst place. Storing the gas is another\nproblem. Although injecting the gas\ninto some geological formations, like\nsaline aquifers and depleted oil fields,\nis claimed to be a safe manageable op-tion, the long term effects of the process are unknown.\nSequestration; storing carbon dioxide in solid minerals, is a similar meth-od. For example, serpentine is a type\nof rock found in quantities sufficient\nto store the carbon dioxide produced\nby the world\u2019s entire known fossil fuel\nreserves. The absorption of the gas by\nthe rock yields magnesite, which can\nbe used in bricks. The energy needed\nto process and transport the rocks,\nhowever, could take us back to square\none.\nHassan Al Halwachi\nTo what extent is geoengineering\nthe solution to the climate change\nproblem?\nHow would knowledge of my genetic makeup\naffect my lifestyle?\nThe Bahraini press noted Hassan's success in the School's competition\n3\n4\n5\n\n"

Boris\u2019 promise to tackle gang culture was an intention\nshared by his rivals. Whilst his focus on respect in society is bold, one would be surprised if he\nhad the magic formula to this national problem.\nImprove London\u2019s transport\nBoris\u2019 policy is two-fold, focussing on transport crime as well as efficiency and quality of serv-ice. He intends to remove free travel privileges from those who abuse London transport, forcing them to earn it back through community service. This is in line with the Mayor\u2019s emphasis\non respect within society. Boris has promised a wide-range of changes to improve the quality\nof transport, including a no-strike agreement with the tube unions; quashing the plans of a\n\u00a325 Congestion Charge increase; and to phase out bendy buses. Following comments from the\nlargest tube union\u2019s leader, Bob Crow, the chances of a no-strike agreement being reached are\nnil. Whilst Boris\u2019 plans to tackle crime on buses may bear fruit, his policies on the Congestion\nCharge and the bendy buses are reactionary, and he has shown few fresh ideas to really tackle\nthe problems with London\u2019s transport.\nTackle our environment\u2019s problems\nBoris intends to increase the amount of recycling in London, to improve the quality of local\nneighbourhoods and is committed to cutting London\u2019s carbon emissions by 60% by 2025. He\nopposes the development of the third runway at Heathrow and also wants to set up an annual\nMayor\u2019s prize to award \u00a320,000 to students for innovative, low-carbon technology ideas. His\nmanifesto pledges largely \u201cencourage\u201d Londoners to tackle environmental problems but are\nseemingly devoid of genuine substance.\nMake housing affordable\nBoris plans to deliver 50,000 new homes by 2011 and to renovate the capital\u2019s 84,000 empty\nproperties in an attempt to make housing more affordable for low-income families and those\nentering the property market. A policy that will directly affect students is his promise to protect private tenants from rogue landlords by publishing a \u2018Fair Rents Guide.\u2019 His promises for\nincreasing the number of available homes across London will reassure Londoners who face\ngreat difficulty buying property during this period of economic instability. However, the severity of the global crisis will make his promises difficult to deliver.\nDeliver a successful Olympic Games\nBoris has pledged to fight for a lasting legacy for the London Olympics so that once the Games\nis finished, the city is not left with unused infrastructure and facilities. He is committed to ensuring the cost to the taxpayer remains at current levels, so that any extra money put towards\nthe Olympics is not paid for through London Council Tax increases. Boris\u2019 promises are similar to the previous Mayor\u2019s and there is little room for real political impact and fresh policies\nto be created. The new Mayor\u2019s main challenge is to ensure no major mistakes are made in\npreparation of the 2012 Olympics and to develop an effective working relationship with Labour\u2019s Tessa Jowell, who has previously referred to Boris as a \u201cbit of a joke.\u201d\nWritten by Tom Roberts, Kadhim Shubber & Gilead Amit.

    "content": "12 felix Friday 9 May 2008\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nA. Geek\nNo laughing matter\nI\ncan\u2019t help but feel that Boris is\ntoo easy a target this week \u2013 not\njust in physical terms, in the\nsense that photos of him cycling\nto work look like they\u2019ve been\ntaken from a leaflet raising awareness\nabout cruelty to narwhals but also in\nthe sense that, as many of you have\nbeen all too quick to remind me this\nweek, he did get elected \u2018by democratic\nprocess\u2019 and is thus entitled to at least\nseven days of swearless seething from\nme.\nHowever, the term \u2018by democratic\nprocess\u2019 tends to conceal all manner of\nevils nowadays. These evils are largely\nconcerned with America of course,\nand thus I get to put on a kind of bemused smile whilst watching it happen\nmuch like the rest of the country did\nlast Friday when the election results\nwere announced. However, occasionally America\u2019s older brother gets pissed\nand starts beating his political process\nof a wife, and it\u2019s at that point that humour gives way to horror.\nSomehow, in the clamour and sweaty\npalms of last Friday, five percent of the\nLondoners that went out to put a cross\nin a box next to the phrase \u2018British National Party\u2019. The London Assembly\nnow bears that terrible phrase on its\nwebsite, when referring to its mem-bers. This means that we, as a City,\nhave failed.\nI can go on for hours \u2013 ask my girlfriend \u2013 about any topic you like.\nThrow one at me. I\u2019ll rant for hour after hour, plucking out as colourful an\ninsult as I can at each occasion. I\u2019ll slap\nyou around a bit, draw out pie charts\nrepresenting the distribution of all the\nreasons why your opinion is worthless,\nI\u2019ll even cajole you into insulting yourself if I\u2019m on a particularly good streak.\nIt\u2019s great fun, even if a little hypocrisy\nslips in here or there.\nThat\u2019s why Boris is a good target. I\nre-read my piece from last Autumn\nabout Boris\u2019 impending election, and I\nstand by it \u2013 the man\u2019s a buffoon, and\nthe Tories pushed him forward in order\nto seize control of the mayoral hotseat.\nHowever, there\u2019s a distinction between\nBoris \u2013 a walking joke who we can all\nchuckle at in publications much like\nthis \u2013 and Richard Barnbrook, who is\nabsolutely no laughing matter at all. At\nall.\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight first, and\nI feel a certain level of appropriateness\nin quoting Marcus Brigstocke here \u2013\n\u201cthe BNP are racist, and if you vote for\nthem, so are you\u201d. There is no middle\nground here, there is no distortion of\nthe truth, there is no quiet revolution.\nThere is just a political party based\naround a contorted idea of patriotism,\nand on the other side there is the sane\nportion of the population. That\u2019s the\nend of the story.\nI like to think that not a single one\nof you reading this voted for them.\nThe thought that someone at Imperial,\nsomeone young and passionate about\ntheir future in whatever form, would\nactually stand up and say they believed\nin the BNP\u2019s values makes me sick\nthinking about it. And I don\u2019t think\nenough people are making this clear.\nMembers of the London Assembly\nhave already stated that they will not\nwork with Barnbrook, who also gained\na seat on the Assembly. That\u2019s all well\nand good. But unfortunately, in the\ninterests of fair politics, some people\nhave chosen to stand up and give the\nsame line I was fed about Boris. Barnbrook was elected democratically. He\ndeserves his chance to represent those\nthat voted for him.\nBullshit. There\u2019s a difference between\nsomeone like Boris and someone like\nBarnbrook. Here it is \u2013 you can tell a\njoke about Boris\u2019 party and still laugh\nafterwards.\nSee, we can banter about Boris\non these pages, and have a good old\nchuckle. I can tell you that the way he\u2019s\nbeen transformed through PR over the\nprevious few weeks makes it look like\nthey\u2019ve fitted some kind of cybernetic\nimplant into his head like the one they\nused to control beetles via remote. I\nlike the idea of Gordon Brown sitting\nin the audience during Newsnight, tapping responses into his mobile before\ntexting them off to the receiver hidden\nunderneath the floppy hair.\nBut with Barnbrook, there are no\njokes. We can\u2019t afford to joke about\nit. There\u2019s just a clear dividing line, a\npoint where democracy stops becoming important and everything can be\nswept aside in favour of simply saying\nno. No debate. No discussion. We don\u2019t\nneed to ask what merits they have, what\npart they play in the system. There is\nno question of democratic process, of\ndue right, or of representation. There\nis only one question \u2013 who is voting for\nthe British National Party? And why?\nThese questions need to be answered\nbefore the next general election. Because the answers are the only way\nwe\u2019ll remove this anomaly from British\nPolitics. Ironically, it is not immigra-tion, nor the EU that makes me feel like\nI do not own the word \u2018British\u2019. It\u2019s the\nquasi-racists that grow year on year\nthat make me feel ashamed to admit to\nmy nationality. If you want to reclaim\nthis country, then the BNP are the extremists that have to go first.\n\u201c\nquoting\nMarcus\nBrigstocke here:\n\u201cthe BNP are\nracist, and if you\nvote for them, so\nare you\u201d\n\u201d Dear Felix,\nIts 2.30 am on the Sunday after the\nelections and I\u2019m still awake, sober as a judge. Whilst this may not\nseem surprising during exam season at Imperial, what with all the\nnight owls populating the library\nat all hours, I\u2019m not awake for revi-sion. I\u2019m awake because something\nhas been buzzing around my head\nsince I saw the election results for\nthe General London Assembly. The\nBritish National Party, that champion of the British right wing, has\nwon a seat. That means they got over\n5% of the London-wide vote. It also\nmeans that whilst before I was proud\nof being a Londoner born and bred, I\nam also now a bit embarrassed.\nAll the mainstream mayoral candidates wax lyrical about how London is a diverse, multicultural and\nvibrant city yet the BNP still manage\nto get a seat. How? I suppose it isn\u2019t\nthat important, I accept that we live\nin a democracy and that they now\nhave every right to that seat. But I\nhave a niggling sense it could have\nbeen avoided.\nMany people I spoke to leading up\nto the election told me they were voting for Boris because he was a joker,\na legend, against Ken because they\ndidn\u2019t like him as a person. Their\nchoice, they can vote on personality in a political contest if they will.\nWhat makes me uncomfortable is\nhow many told me they weren\u2019t voting at all because they didn\u2019t know or\ncare about the candidates\u2019 policies,\nand that was for the well-publicised\nmayoral election. How many had\neven given a thought to the GLA?\nThink about it for a moment, how\nmany people out there didn\u2019t vote\nfor similar reasons? With a turnout\nof less than 50% I think we can safely\nassume a hell of a lot.\nNow, pretty much anyone that\nsupports the BNP will have turned\nout to vote for them. They are good\nat getting those who agree with them\nto act. But what of all those people\nout there that find the BNP and its\npolicies worrying, offensive and in\nsome cases even threatening? Many\nof them will have voted for a party\nthey find more palatable in the GLA\nelections, but many won\u2019t have voted\nat all. I\u2019m sure some of Felix\u2019s readers are amongst them. The question\nis do they actively disagree with the\nBNP? Did the ones disagreeing with\nthem do anything to prevent them\ngaining the 5% that won them a seat?\nWell done to them if they did, but if\nthey didn\u2019t: well, I can\u2019t force them\nto vote but I can tell them that they\nworry me almost as much as the\nBNP do.\nI\u2019m scared by the fact that the apathy of our society is providing the\nconditions for what I consider the\npolitical face of the National Front\nto gain a foothold in London. A foothold that they deserve in democratic\nterms, but that I cannot believe represents their actual London-wide\npopularity. If it does, my embarrassment at their apparent popularity in\nLondon is justified. If it doesn\u2019t, all I\ncan do is hope that next time people\nwill do something to stop them\u2026.\nYours,\nMatthew Kaufeler\nThe BNP and\nsociety\u2019s\npolitical apathy\nBoris Johnson: Joke and inset, Richard Barnbrook: No joke\n\u201c\nWith\nBarnbrook, there\nare no jokes.\nWe can\u2019t afford\nto joke about it.\nHave Londoners failed as a collective because Richard Barnbrook has\nbeen successfully elected to the London Assembly?\n\n"

    "content": "35\nfelix\nFriday 9 May 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nCatching the last snow of the season\nT\nhis year saw a respectable 39 students from IC\nmake the journey to the\nchosen venue of Saalbach-Hintleglemm (not\nfar from the Austro-German bor-der, near Munich), where we joined\nmore than 2,000 other students from\nuniversities around Britain in anticipation of a week of great skiing (or\nboarding, if you\u2019re into that), great\npartying and great experiences.\nFirst, though, we had to get\nthere. BUSC (British Universities\nSnowsports Council) offers a frankly\nfantastic package which includes\n6 nights\u2019 self-catered accommoda-tion, a 6-day lift pass (quite a valuable thing, it must be said) and travel\nto and from the resort, all for \u00a3329.\nAt this price, one understands why\ntravel consists of an exhausting, yet\nalways somewhat amusing, near-24\nhour coach journey (which might\nhave been longer had it not been\nfor the Autobahn). However, in my\nopinion this is all part of the fun \u2013\nit is here where you meet the people\nthat you\u2019ll be skiing / boarding with\nfor the rest of the week \u2013 equally, you\nalso quickly realise who you won\u2019t be\n\u2013 being woken at 4 in the morning as\nwe were peacefully cruising through\nthe French countryside by a drunken\nSouthampton Uni student who simply couldn\u2019t contain his delight at the\nunspoiled environment, didn\u2019t rate\nhim terribly highly in my books, it\nmust be said. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds,\nthough, the journey really isn\u2019t that\nbad and as soon as you start seeing\nthe white stuff gradually becoming\nmore and more concentrated on\nthe winding ascent up to the resort,\nyou can\u2019t help but forget your tired-ness. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that it\nwas dark when we arrived, I\u2019m sure\na lot of us would have been out on\nthe slopes as soon as we arrived. Instead, we settled for a quiet pint of\nStiegl (the ubiquitous, probably-bet-ter-that-our-most-expensive, lager)\nand an early night in preparation\nfor catching the first lift on our first\nmorning.\nI awoke to a beautiful day \u2013 the highest peak, at just over 2000m, was shining bright in the fierce, spring sun. I\nslipped on my thermal undergarments,\nput on my waterproof jacket and trou-sers, donned my thick socks and boots,\ngrabbed my skis and goggles and I was\nready for the day. (The skis and boots I\nhad rented as an addition to the BUSC\npackage and it is also easy to rent clothing and other equipment if the need\narises). A matter of minutes later six\nother students that I\u2019d met on the bus\n(all from IC in fact) and I were stepping\nintoaliftcabin,skisandboardsinhand,\npreparing to be whisked up a mountain\nwhere we would begin our first run of\nthe week. A few seconds to admire\nthe splendid panoramic views at the\ntop of the mountain before we clipped\nourselves in to our preferred mediums\nand we were away! The experience is\nsimply hard to put into words \u2013 pistes\n(French for \u2018slopes\u2019) are the marked,\nmaintained routes down the mountain\n(which are patrolled throughout the\nday) \u2013 they are very often as wide as a\ndry ski-slope is long and can go on for\nmany miles, making skiiing down them\nis a blissful experience. On the ski trip\nat Xmas, being a novice, I spent my entire time on pistes. 20 minutes later we\nwere at the bottom of the slope, keen\nto get back to the top of the mountain\nto do another run. Another run later\nand it was just about time for my lesson \u2013 I unclipped my skis and made\nmy way through the town centre to the\nmain congregation area.\nRegardless of your ability, I strongly\nrecommend taking lessons \u2013 they are\nvery good value (roughly \u00a375 for 10\n= 2 hours a day for 5 days) and really\nhelp you to either simply learn to ski\nor hone your skills. As I\u2019ve mentioned,\non the Xmas trip I was essentially a\ncomplete novice, barely even able to\nturn \u2013 but because of a combination\nof lessons in the morning and practicing what I\u2019d learnt in the afternoon, by\nthe end of the week I was able to comfortably ski reds (moderate difficulty)\nand even attempt the odd black level\nslope. Of course, skiing/snowboard-ing is not all about being able to race\ndown the slope at some stupid angle to\nthe vertical, even if you just wanna play\naround a bit that\u2019s all well and good. In\nfact, this Easter we had a significant\nnumber of complete beginners attend\nand I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t disagree with\nme when I say that they all thoroughly\nenjoyed themselves.\nAs I\u2019ve said, skiing/snowboarding\nisn\u2019t all about being able to race down\nthe slope, far from it \u2013 a big part of\nBUSC is the socialising. Indeed, as\nsoon as you arrive you are issued with\na calender of events, detailing what\u2019s\nhappening each night of the week.\nFor instance, on the Sunday evening\nthere was an hour-and-a-half long\nfirework-lit display from professional and semi-professional freestyle skiiers and boarders (basically\nan hour and a half of wondering who\nwas going be airlifted first) followed\nby VJs \u2018Urban Knightz\u2019 playing live in\nthe main square with plenty of clubs\nto go to afterwards if you fancied it\n\u2013 but remember, the snow\u2019s best in\nthe morning! Every other night of\nthe week was similarly exciting, the\nmost anticipated night of all being\nwhen the DJ trio \u2018Scratch Perverts\u2019\nwere due to play \u2013 the hype was\nright, a great night it was \u2013 hundreds\nof students in a packed venue jumping around to some mean tunes. If\ngoing out partying isn\u2019t your thing,\nthough, or you\u2019re too tired from a\nday of skiing/boarding, then no wor-ries, there\u2019s plenty of other things to\ndo around the area - some nice restaurants and even cinemas.\nSo, in essence, my week @ BUSC\nconsisted of plenty of skiing, plenty of partying and plenty of new\nfriends. A typical ski trip certainly\ndoesn\u2019t come cheap, but that\u2019s where\nBUSC is different \u2013 with a starting\nprice of \u00a3329 and considering what\na truly fantastic week you\u2019ll have, it\u2019s\nvery easy to justify the price in my\nopinion. Plus the fact that it\u2019s the\nfirst week of a long easter break just\nmakes it the perfect thing to look\nforward to.\nAnd if you can\u2019t wait that long and\nyou want some relief after the Autumn term, the Snowsports society\nwill be running their annual Winter\ntrip with prices strarting from \u00a3300\n(incl. travel, accommodation and lift\npass). We\u2019ll also be running dry-ski\nslope lessons and trips to the Milton Keynes indoor artificial snow\nslope throughout the year. For more\ninformation and signing up, please\nvisit www.sfahdsfhasjf.com or add\nme (Sam Campaigne) or any of the\nsnowsports committee on Facebook.\nHave a great summer and hope to\nsee you there!\nThe gang enjoying the warmth of the indoors\n\u201cThe experience\nis simply hard to\nput into words\u201d\n\u201cSkiing isn\u2019t all\nabout going\ndown a hill,\nit\u2019s about the\nsocialising too\u201d\nSam Champaigne reports on the Snowsports Club trip to Saalbach-Hintleglemm\n\n"

The\nyouth of the world flocked to this\nsite, connecting with their old\nfriends and making new ones. It\nquickly became one of the most popular\nsites on the internet. People could add\nanything to their profile page, and unfortunately lots of people did. Most profiles\nbecame a nightmare of badly implemented HTML, garish colours and automatically playing songs.\nBut then along came Facebook; with its\nfancy AJAX interface and simple yet stylish design it became a second home for\na generation of university students. The\nnovel way of connecting people through\nevents and tagging in photographs forever changed the way people interacted\nonline.\nThen in May 2007 Facebook introduced applications. While on Myspace\nmost people spent their time staying\nin touch with friends and visiting band\npages, Facebook\u2019s applications added a\nwhole new dimension to social network-ing. Almost overnight a plethora of ways\nto waste time arrived. Quizzes, games\nand hundreds of other applications for\nyour profile suddenly appeared, and with\nthem came application invitations. Annoyingly, these work in a similar way to\npyramid schemes, by rewarding users\nfor bombarding their friends with in-vites, who then often have to invite more\nfriends to fully use the application.\nThese days Myspace is becoming much\nmore like Facebook by giving people an\nupdateable status and introducing appli-cations. This is mainly due to the fact that\nFacebook\u2019s user-base grows by hundreds\nof thousands a day and in some countries has many more active users. This is\nbad news for NewsCorp who spent over\n$500million buying MySpace and have\nyet to turn any meaningful profit. Therefore, desperate to keep their users while\nthey figure out how to make a profit, they\nhave to resort to imitating features from\nother sites. In my opinion, this won\u2019t help.\nBoth sites became popular because they\noffered something new, and by copying\nFacebook, Myspace isn\u2019t doing this. That\nis why I believe that in the future neither\nsite will reign supreme.\nIt reminds me of a statement I carry\nwith me through life. As the story goes,\nKing Solomon once asked his advisors for\nan assertion which would remain eternally true. They went away and discussed\nit and then came back with the phrase,\n\u2018This too shall pass\u2019. All things change, for\nbetter or for worse. Though in the technological world, they generally get better.\nThe huge growth of Facebook in a matter of years shows how easily people will\nchange between social-networking sites\nwhen something new comes along and\nthere is no reason to think this won\u2019t happen again. Innovation drives the world\nwe live in and sure as the sun will set, a\nnew social-networking experience will\narrive at some point. But in what shape\nwill it come?\nNo-one can know, but perhaps it could\ntake the form of 6pages.com, created by\nsome of Imperial College\u2019s own students.\nIt may seem like an insurmountable hill\nto try and compete with massive cor-porations, but Facebook was created by\nstudents at Harvard: so perhaps they are\ntrying to emulate the same success. The\nsite clearly sports a similar clean and interactive feel to Facebook with all the elements of the page flowing together. But is\nit anything else apart from another Facebook clone?\nFrom testing the site, apart from all the\nusual friends and groups, the main difference seems to be the emphasis on user-generated articles which can contain\nnews, funny Youtube links or anything\nelse you might feel like sharing with the\nworld. These are connected to the network of the user (e.g. Imperial College).\nOnly popular articles then get filtered up\ninto larger networks (e.g. London) and\nfinally to the national level for the whole\ncountry to enjoy.\nThis could, perhaps, put it in competition with Imperial\u2019s CGCU-run news-website, Live, which reports on news\naround Imperial College and the wider\nworld. However, unlike a traditional\nnewspaper or online news-site, everyone\ncan be a writer on 6pages. The obvious\nproblem here is the possible low quality\nof the content that Joe Bloggs might post,\nperhaps talking about his new trainers\nor a video of his drunken mate, although\nthrough a system based on popularity, all\nthe useless articles should just fade away\ninto the bowels of the Internet, leaving\nonly enjoyable content behind.\nHowever, compared to the funded\nnewspaper and website at Imperial, a site\nlike 6pages.com would be free from any\nrestrictions on what could be published.\nThis could lead to very vocal opinions\nabout various parts/members/policies of\nthe union, more anecdotal experiences\nand generally a more \u2018on the ground\u2019\nview of life. This could be good reading\nfor when people aren\u2019t looking for \u2018proper\u2019 news.\nAnother interesting feature they have\nintegrated into the site is the media cen-tre, which brings together outside content from news-sites, online TV streams\nand also online radio stations. While it\ncontains all the obvious BBC services\nthey also collate an interesting range of\nother services from \u2018Martial Art TV\u2019 to\nthe latest news from \u2018L\u2019equipe\u2019. It was actually surprisingly useful to have all these\nservices melded together so simply with\nno need to visit each site. Again, over time\nthe most popular sources will be priori-tised to save users time, which appears to\nbe a major aim of the site, to bring together lots of different Internet experiences in\none place.\nWhile 6pages may still have a few bugs\nand usability issues, it\u2019s still in beta and\ncan only improve. Ironing out the last few\ncreases in this web of networks could end\nup producing something very promising.\nA compelling mix between Facebook\nand Digg, squashed together with content from all across the Internet. But don\u2019t\ntake my word for it, try it out yourself and\nsee if you think it\u2019s got what it takes to be\nthe next big thing.\n6pages.com: Think Digg meets Facebook with a splattering of content from across the Internet\nLeft: it all began with Myspace, and right: the mighty behemoth Facebook\n\n"

But there\u2019s\nnothing sweeter, in my experience of\nfilm, than to discover an actor by yourself and to let him drag you along in an\nexploration of cinema. Especially when\nyou reach a point of saturation; when\nyou\u2019ve seen what you wanted to see\nand don\u2019t really know what to see next,\nan actor can prove extremely helpful.\nGeorge C. Scott is one of these actors,\nhaving helped me out of late. Probably\nnot as well known as his contemporar-ies, such as Marlon Brando and James\nStewart, Scott is a four times Oscar\nnominated actor who had a severe distaste for the whole show thrown up by\nAre you tired of seeing the same old faces on the screen and bored of George\nClooney\u2019s over-confident countenance?

Under the guidance of Alex Casey I\u2019ll be slowly taking over his position as the Film editor\nso that when the new term starts after\nthe summer holidays, the Film section\nwon\u2019t be missing from Felix.\nNow just a few words about what you\nshould expect in the new issues. I\u2019ll do\nmy best to have a film section printed\nout in Felix every week, but can\u2019t make\nany promises about that. I am interested in a vast range of film genres and so\nI\u2019d like to keep this section pretty min-gled. I enjoy writing about really crap\nmovies (they are so much easier to\nwrite about) so expect to see a lot of reviews beseeching you not to see something and thus saving you 10 quid. But\nif you are feeling like doing some lavish spending then hopefully the DVD\nsection, which I\u2019m planning to start,\nwill help you when you\u2019re out of ideas.\nDon\u2019t anticipate interactive parts in the\nsection like quizzes or puzzles or what-not, but do look out for a Comments\nsection where you can post your opinions about movies if you don\u2019t feel like\nwriting a whole review but want your\nviews heard nevertheless.\nIf you feel like getting yourself\nheard, then contribute to Felix\nFilm.

He refused to be nominated for his performance in The Hustler\n(1961) on his second nomination for\nbest supporting actor \u2013 Anatomy of a\nMurder (1959) was the first \u2013 and after being awarded the Oscar for Best\nActor in a leading role for Patton, he\ndid not accept it. His justification was\nthat he did not feel himself to be in a\ncompetition with other actors, but he\nis also quoted to have said that the Oscars were all a \u201cmeat parade\u201d.\nIronically, the first film I saw Scott\nin, not knowing who he was or what he\nhad done, was 12 Angry Men (1997), his\nfirst of two excellent remakes with Jack\nLemmon \u2013 the second would be Scott\u2019s\nlast film, Inherit the Wind (1999). Only\na few years later did I get to see Dr.\nStrangelove (1964). His famed over-the-top performance, which he was\n\u201ctricked into\u201d by director Stanley Kubrick, stuck with me even more than\nPeter Sellers\u2019 three character bonanza\n(not to say that Sellers wasn\u2019t brilliant\nhimself). At that time though, I still felt\nfilm had many other things to offer and\nI shamelessly ignored George C. Scott\nuntil I laid eyes on Patton, earlier this\nyear.\nIn Patton he delivers an exquisitely\nbalanced portrayal of the eponymous\neccentric general who led the US armies during World War II in North Africa and Sicily. It\u2019s really these kind of\nperformances that gives films the level\nbeyond the array of technical excellence which, however brilliant, rarely\nleads to a feeling of real satisfaction\nand fulfilment.\nNext I moved on to the film which\nbrought Scott his fourth Oscar nomi-nation, The Hospital (1971), a very\nbizarre, dark comedy with an unusual\nplot and even more unusual characters.\nWhile the actors\u2019 performances were\nconvincing and the Oscar-winning\nscript really turned it all up a notch,\nThe Hospital surely isn\u2019t a film fit for\neveryone\u2019s tastes, so approach at your\nown risk. In The Changeling (1980) he\nco-starred with Melvyn Douglas, in a\nfilm about a house with a dark past: a\ncross between the recent The Orphanage (2007) and something of an Oliver\nStone-ian political thriller. Although\nnot the most enticing of films \u2013 as it often happens when you simply go along\nfor the ride - it\u2019s worth the time for fans\nof the spooky genre. My next step will\nbe Petulia (1968), starring Julie Christie, of which I\u2019ve seen a bit before being\ntaken aback by the weirdness of it.\nAfter I run out of films in which\nScott takes up leading roles, I\u2019ll probably want to see his other two Oscar\nnominated films and hopefully change\ntracks to someone else, like James\nStewart (likely) or Paul Newman (not\nas likely).\nIf you\u2019re wondering what this is all\nabout, there are two points to my story.\nFirst, to write about the achievements\nof a great actor and perhaps attract\nsome interest to his body of work. And\nsecond, to emphasise that watching\nfilms is not only about ticking away the\ngreat success stories, but also about\nexploring the unknown of cinema and,\nperhaps, ourselves.\nIf we get too bored of everything\nelse, that is.\nWhat is it about Indiana Jones?\nIt won\u2019t be long now before the whip-wielding, fedora-loving archaeologist graces our cinema screens again\nGeorge C. Scott as the American tank commander during World War II, General George S. Patton\nWhilst waiting for the premiere of\nthis fourth installation of an Indiana\nJones movie, entitled Indiana Jones\nand The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\nand wondering how bad this sequel\nwill turn out to be, I thought that it\nwould be nice to try and find out what\nit is that made the first film such a cult\nmovie.\nObviously there is the adventure as-pect. Raiders of the Lost Ark (the first\nin the series of Indiana Jones movies)\nstarts off with an action-packed scene\nin an exotic location that sets the tone\nfor the whole movie. The thrill of dodging huge, rolling boulders and danger-ous, native inhabitants interspersed\nwith numerous booby traps and the\nconsequent near-misses that we are\nintroduced to in the beginning continues throughout the whole movie, with\na plethora of cliffhanger moments that\nmake you move just that tad closer to\nthe edge of your seat. And although\neveryone knows the hero will always\ncome out unscarred, the audience\u2019s\nfascination with the perilous incidents\ndoesn\u2019t end till the very last minute.\nThe credit for this goes to George\nLucas and Steven Spielberg who use,\nwith excellent results, their ability to\nbring a childlike joy and happiness\nto the process of movie watching, reminding us that movies are ultimately\nabout good entertainment. The additional bonus is that the film can\nboast a plot that is able to move the\nstory forward in between all those\nbar brawls, long jumps over precipitous drops, and last minute escapes in\nairplanes.\nThen, of course, we have Harrison\nFord, who perfectly catches the essence of Indiana Jones. In the movie\nhe is a fantastic blend of self confi-dence, reckless daring, quick wits and\nan ability to take himself a little bit less\nseriously than everyone around him,\nwhich saves him from being simply an\narrogant smart-ass. It is Ford\u2019s tongue-in-cheek acting that ironically gives\nthe Raiders of the Lost Ark a warmth\nthat I believe will be very hard to find\nin the new sequel.\nHaving said that, and despite the\nlead actor\u2019s significant advance in\nage since 1981, I\u2019m still looking forward to seeing Indiana Jones on the\nbig screen for the first time. Mainly\nbecause of the assurances made by\nSteven Spielberg that he has tried to\nkeep computer generated imagery to\nan absolute minimum, using instead\nthe traditional stunts that have proved\nso successful in the previous install-ments. If, on top of that, the director\nmanages to somehow endow The\nKingdom of the Crystal Skull with an\n\u2018old school\u2019 feel (like the other sequels\nhad) and doesn\u2019t forget that the success of the movie ultimately depends\non whether Indiana Jones\u2019 personality\nand his character shines through all\nthe action, it might be worth spending the 10 quid to watch the old man\ntrying to find the treasure again. And\nwho knows, maybe Harrison Ford just\ngets fitter with age? I don\u2019t remember Indy having quite so much grey in his hair\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\n\n"

We\u2019ve all got ex-ams, big deal. But try as\nyou might, you can\u2019t get\nthrough three, four or five\nweeks of work without needing some\nrelaxation time at some point. And by\nrelaxation, I don\u2019t mean collapsing into\nsleep for two hours, on top of a pile of\nnotes.\nThat\u2019s what most people find best\nabout gaming \u2013 it covers all the bases.\nI\u2019ve got my Peggle for brief five-minute\nflirts with procrastination, and I\u2019ve also\ngot Grand Theft Auto III for when I\u2019m\nlooking to massacre a slightly larger\nportion of the day.\nWhat I\u2019ve found myself playing most,\nin fact, is GTA III. Not because I don\u2019t\nlike GTA IV, or that I don\u2019t have a next-gen console to play it on, but simply\nbecause I\u2019ve not played anything other\nthan the original Grand Theft Auto\nin my life. A few weeks back, Steam\ntempted me into the land of Liberty\nCity, and despite several years of rave\nreviews and friend recommendations,\nI was still surprised at just how good\nit is.\nI have to say, I think it\u2019s the radio. The\nworld does feel alive, certainly; there\nare plenty of people running around\non the streets and the cars look nice.\nBuildings are decorated in that Rockstar manner of dark humour, and the\nsights still look lovely to me even with\nthe graphics this old.\nBut the radio is the human voice. It\u2019s\nthe background noise that every city\nneeds, because even with missions\nand the like it\u2019s still the radio that feels\nmost real. The radio doesn\u2019t talk to you\nabout drugs busts or bank jobs. It just\nwants to sell you giraffes via mail order,\nand get you to discuss your views on\nmilitary service.\nLips 106 is my station of choice for\nthe first island. Cheap, commercial,\nit smacks of American media in all\nthe good ways it can. The presenters\nare sugary, horribly happy and it feels\ngreat to bomb along Chinatown listening to some godawful pop. It gives that\nreal Sunday-morning vibe to gunning\ndown Triad members.\nLike most good games, I\u2019d initially\nbeen skeptical of Grand Theft Auto III.\nBecause most people tell me that they\nenjoy just seeing how much damage\nthey can cause, I assumed I wouldn\u2019t\nlike it because that kind of will happens\nvery rarely with me. I occasionally like\nto attract the attention of a helicopter,\nbut in general I actually prefer the opposite \u2013 I prefer living in the city.\nBut that\u2019s why the game works, because it offers the freedom to do so.\nIf you\u2019ve got Steam and you want to\nknow the minutiae of my gaming life,\nfeel free to add me \u2013 I\u2019m FinalSin on\nthe Community. Alternatively, write\nand tell us your alternate gaming lives:\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGood luck with those exams, folks.\nMichael Cook asks if you know what it\u2019s like to have killed a man. Then kills you\nG\nrass grows, sun shines,\nbirds fly, and brother? I\nhurt people. But not in\na childish way, or a loud\nand brash way. I don\u2019t\nrun around with a stick of aluminium\ncleaving people\u2019s faces in, nor do I\npump people full of lead. It\u2019s more sub-tle. In fact, even as the flickknife buries\nitself in your back, it\u2019s not the one-hit\nkill that hurts you. That\u2019s not how I\nwork. I humiliate people.\nWhen you go on to play Team Fortress 2 \u2013 Valve\u2019s epic first-person\nshooter that recently enjoyed a free\nweekend and a bunch of free content\n\u2013 you\u2019re not gambling much. There\u2019s\nno money on the table, and there\u2019s\nno fate-of-the-world scenario. Players\ngamble one of two things when they go\nonline to game, and the most often lost\nof these is reputation.\nOut of all of the playable classes, the\nSpy stands out as different. There are\nfew gaming characters in multiplayer\nhistory who compare to him \u2013 hugely\nunderpowered, incapable of dealing\ndamage in most cases, and carrying\nitems that are at best difficult to use,\nand at worst dependent on luck.\nBut when the Spy plays well, he\nstands out among every other player\non the server. Spies are the passive-aggressives, they\u2019re the real bullies of\nTF2: more so than the Heavy or the\nDemoman. When you\u2019re disguised as\na member of the opposite team, you\nhave a special power over them. And it\nhurts on both sides of the monitor.\nAt the start of part of the Dustbowl\nmap, the two teams tend to collect on\neither side of a corner. On the Red side,\nseveral gun emplacements are whir-ring, and Medics are preparing to heal\nthe big damage-dealers. Heavies are\nbig and stupid, but they dish out the\nhurt like nothing else if they\u2019ve got a\nMedic behind them.\nI\u2019m on the Blue side, wearing a pinstripe suit and smoking a delicate\ncigarette. It\u2019s decision time for the\nSpies, because disguises mean making\na commitment. If someone sees you\ndisguised at the start of a round, then\npeople know you\u2019re there, and everyone gets edgy. Edginess means death.\nMost people choose the average\nclasses, the ones that blend in. Demoman is a popular disguise, sometimes\na Medic to lure people towards you.\nBut good spies take the occasional risk\ntoo, and so today I\u2019m slinging on a fat\nsuit and disguising myself as one of the\nmost obvious classes in the game \u2013 a\nHeavy. I tap the cloaking button and\ndash around the corner just as the last\nof my team die and go back to await\nrespawning.\nI dash up some steps, taking care\nto avoid others whilst I\u2019m invisible,\nand leap into an alcove to wait for the\nright moment. The Reds are pushing\naround the corner, according to the\nstream of death messages flashing up,\nbut it seems they\u2019re being pushed back.\nAs the cloaking fades off, a Red Medic\ncomes running back from the fighting.\nI\u2019m sure he\u2019s seen me materialise out of\nnowhere. There\u2019s a horrible moment\nwhere I see him switch weapon and\nconsider running.\nOnly it turns out that he\u2019s switching\nto his healing gun. He turns it on. Interesting things start to happen.\nA friend of mine says that he won\u2019t\never play the Spy on moral grounds. I\ndon\u2019t know to what extent he\u2019s joking,\nand I suspect it\u2019s more to do with the\nfact that the Spy can be a little boring\nat times. When you\u2019re playing a Soldier\n\u2013 a more simple, damaging class that\nHalo fans might be familiar with \u2013 the\ngame bobs along at a reasonable rate.\nYou don\u2019t get any of the dizzying highs,\nreally, but on the other hand you\u2019re\nalways scoring, there\u2019s no dull period\nwhere you die repeatedly and have\nyour plans dashed.\nBecause, other than reputation, the\nother thing we sacrifice by playing online is time. Team Fortress 2 helpfully\nreminds you of just how much time\nyou\u2019ve poured into it, and my top two\nclasses alone score over a day\u2019s worth\nof play. That\u2019s not much, however, in\ncomparison to others who have spent\nsomething approaching a week with a\nsingle character type.\nSo time is important. Time\u2019s important for Spies, because disguise and\nsubtlety takes planning and patience.\nIt\u2019s also important for Medics. By\nhealing, a Medic can build up a special power that allows him to make a\nplayer invulnerable for a short time\nperiod. The standard tactic is to walk\nthe player into the midst of the action,\ntearing apart player after player, before\nretreating to safety. That\u2019s why, as the\nmedic begins healing me and I see that\nhe\u2019s fully charged, I know that this is\ngoing to be a very awful sixty seconds\nfor him.\nI shout \u2018Medic!\u2019 once, for good mea-sure, and then charge towards the front\nlines. To him, I look like a lumbering\nlump of muscle and gun \u2013 a brick shit-house that fires other, smaller brick\nshithouses. But really, I\u2019m a European\nchain-smoker with a knife fetish.\nAs we near the corner, I shout at him\nagain and there\u2019s a reassuring \u2018whoosh\u2019\nas he activates the charge and I glow\na fierce red. I walk around the corner,\nand there is the rest of my team, all\nready and respawned. To them, I appear as I really am. Small, weak, and\ntricksy. A chorus of laughs goes out\nover the voice communication as they\nrealise what I\u2019ve done.\nI walk further into them, and the\nMedic follows me to make sure he\nkeeps the charge running. It\u2019s probably half full now, and I haven\u2019t fired\na shot, something that will be making\nhim suspicious. But, trooper that he is,\nhe stays with it. A quarter left. A tenth.\nAnd the ubercharge is done.\nImmediately, three heavies open up\non the Medic, and he goes sprawling\nthrough the air into a bloody pile. He\ndoesn\u2019t know what happened to me.\nHe doesn\u2019t even know I was a Spy. In\nfact, as far as he\u2019s aware, his team is full\nof appalling players who get him killed\nand waste his time.\nI run back to base and readjust my\ntie, my team still chuckling over the\ningame chat. \u2018Do it again!\u2019 one of them\ncries.\nBut what they don\u2019t know is that,\nbehind the cardboard cut-out mask,\nthe balaclava is wet with tears. That\nMedic just wanted to help people. He\njust wanted to play the game, and have\na good time.\nWhat have I done?\n* You Will Respawn As Medic\nMichael Cook\nCandle in the wind\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a\npinstripe suit\nand smoking\na delicate\ncigarette\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "The next four\nyears with\nBoris Johnson\nBullingdon Boy Boris\u2019 background\nBoris\u2019 recreational pursuits caught on camera\nI\nn the very first minutes of Friday 1st May, Conservative candidate\nBoris Johnson was declared to be the new Mayor of London. Almost six hours after the results were supposed to be announced,\nreturning officer Anthony Mayer read out the polling figures at\nCity Hall. Even though incumbent mayor Livingstone got a substantially larger share of the second preference vote, his 1.03 million\nvotes were not enough to defeat Boris\u2019 1.17 million first and second\npreference supporters. As the results were announced, Boris sheepishly shook hands with the other candidates on the podium, showing\nparticular warmth to his strongest rival. After the speeches by Johnson,\nLivingstone and Paddick, referred to by Boris as the \u2018strange triumvirate\u2019, public attention was drawn to the results of the other parties.\nComing fourth and fifth respectively, only 8,000 votes separated Si\u00e2n\nBerry\u2019s Green party from Richard Barnbrook\u2019s BNP \u2013 a result seen by\nmany in the public as a worrying outcome of this election.\nH\nis defenders have always\nclaimed that his bumbling\nwas an act, that his gaffes\nwere just that and that in\nreality he was a competent\nand intelligent individual. Such defence\nhas been cold comfort for his detractors\nwho saw little evidence of a brain behind\nhis floppy blonde hair. But after winning\n1,168,738 votes in the London Mayoral\ncontest, Boris has overcome his detractors and established himself as a serious\npolitical animal.\nPresident of the Oxford Union and a\nmember of the Bullingdon Club, one\nmight have presumed that his political\ncareer would blossom quickly, in similar\nfashion to fellow Bullingdon members\nDavid Cameron and George Osborne.\nHowever, he chose to enter the world of\njournalism instead, with varied results.\nAlthough Editor of The Spectator from\n1999 to 2005 and Conservative MP for\nHenley from 2001, he was, and still is, best\nknown for the numerous gaffes that have\nplagued his public life. Consequently, despite being a well-known public figure, he\nwas seen as a liability rather than an asset\nto his colleagues; probably more useful to\nthe tabloids than the Conservative par-ty. Despite this, in 2005 fellow Bullingdon Club member David Cameron, now\nleader of the opposition, appointed Boris\nshadow minister of education; his second\ntime in the cabinet after an abortive foray\nunder Michael Howard. Boris might have\ncontinued steadily enough, always in the\npublic spotlight but given little notice as\na credible politician.\nYet here we find ourselves in 2008, and\nthe mayor of one the world\u2019s richest cities is a man who for years has been disregarded as a bumbler. His election to\nthis prestigious position has been accompanied by a miraculous transformation.\nWhen he first announced his candidacy,\nBBC Political Editor Nick Robinson didn\u2019t\nthink it should appear on the main news\nbulletin: he didn\u2019t consider his candidacy\nserious enough. But a carefully managed\ncampaign, free of any gaffes allowed the\npublic to forgive his previous misdemean-ours and put their trust in him. Boris the\nfumbler gradually gained confidence in\ndebates and the intellectual that his defenders have always claimed lay beneath\nthe surface, shone through.\nNot everyone is convinced, though:\nPaul Merton recently joked that Londonders will soon remember that \u201che\u2019s a\nfucking idiot\u201d and, furthermore, rumours\nare swirling that David Cameron is nervous about the possibility of a Boris-style\nGaffegate damaging the Conservative\nParty\u2019s credibility nationwide. The true\nmeasure of his transformation into serious politician will be his record as Mayor.\nHe will either be remembered fondly as\nan entertaining but ultimately successful\npolitician or the man who damaged the\nConservative Party\u2019s best chance of regaining power after 13 years.\nIn a moment of hilarity caught on national television, Boris attempts to tackle an opposition player in a charity football match.\n\n"

It should have no start or finish;\njust like an elastic band.\nEach number indicates how many\nlines should be drawn around it, for\nexample:\nCells which don\u2019t contain a number\ncan be surrounded by any number of\nlines.\nRemember, the line must form a\nloop, so the line cannot branch. The\nfollowing situations are not allowed:\nSquares are not allowed either. There\nare never cells containing the number\n4 in Slitherlink.\nSo, where do you start? The most\ncommon place to start on a Slitherlink grid is by drawing crosses\naround any zeros. Drawing crosses\nis purely done to so that you know\nwhere there can\u2019t possibly be a line.\nSo, take the pattern below as an ex-ample. Begin by drawing crosses,\nthen by filling in some lines:\nNow the lines can only continue in\nthe following directions:\nSlitherlink 1,402\n3\n2 2\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\n1,401 solution\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\n3\n2 3\nTEXT US!

These people came\nGames and Media 2008 at Imperial\nScience meets Space Invaders, SHODAN and Sonic once again as the Imperial GaME Event returns\nYou probably remember the glory days\nwhen E3 was essentially its own nation\nfor the three days that it took over part\nof America. People came, people discovered everything that was going to\nhappen in the next twelve months, and\nthen people left again.\nBefore you had the Internet, it was\neven more tantalising. You\u2019d have to\nwait some time to learn what people\nhad seen there, until the magazines\nbegan throwing exclamation marks on\nthe covers and pictures that you hadn\u2019t\nseen before. It was an exciting time.\nSome things change, and others stay\nthe same. The Games and Media Event\nthat Imperial plays host to each year\nis always a reminder that the world of\ngaming is branching out and making\nitself known elsewhere. It\u2019s also a sign\nthat adding science to something always makes it more interesting.\nGaME is designed to bring together\npeople from the gaming industry \u2013 and\nfurther afield \u2013 with people from the\nworld of academia. The series of talks\nand presentations organized each year\nrange from the light-hearted to the\nmathematical, and this year\u2019s event\nlooks to be no exception.\nYou can check out the expected itinerary to the right (\u201cThe Schedule So\nFar\u201d) \u2013 although it is still provisional,\nthe lineup already includes a wide array\nof industry coverage.\nThe event, which falls on the 21st\nMay this year, may clash with the exam\ntimetables of some departments, but\nits home department \u2013 Computing \u2013\nwill be free of revision by then. The\nevent isn\u2019t designed to simply fill up\nspace in the timetable with a few talks\nabout maths, though.\n\u201cBy developing a good long-term relationship with interesting university\nresearch groups, a company can both\ntap into the research community, and\nsometimes also guide it towards interesting problems\u201d explains Professor\nPaul Kelly, one of the event organisers,\n\u201c[The] industry still needs in-house\neffort, to bridge the gap between research idea and usable technique, and\nto make good choices informed by re-search, about when and how.\u201d\nThe relationship between media industries such as videogaming and research institutions becomes more and\nmore important as technological innovation goes on. In particular, those with\nan analytical mind become in high de-mand, and so \u2018dream\u2019 jobs of working\nin industries that you used to dream of\nas a child, soon become more realistic\nwhen you attend events like this.\nFramestore, for example, is a graphics and visual effects studio with an\nAcademy Award-winning past, and a\nfuture that includes franchises such as\nNarnia, Batman and James Bond. But\nif you gave up hope of working in the\nfilm industry after you failed your Art\nGCSE, this event could help show you\nthat there are places there for scientists\ntoo.\nWith previous events covering programming for the Playstation3, stories\nof success from previous Imperial students in the big, wide, world of gam-ing, and requests for your help building games for the next generation, the\nevent can be inspiring to gamers who\nnever got into E3 before \u2013 which I\u2019m\nfairly sure is most of us.\nThe event is free to attend, but registration is required on the website of\nthe event, where you can also get up-to-date news on the lineup and the\nschedules.\nThe event may also showcase some\nwork from Imperial that has ramifications for the industry \u2013 last year a\nwide range of presentations was seen:\nfrom facial recognition and graphics\nprocessing to massively-multiplayer\nonline networking technologies.\n\u201cIt is Imperial\u2019s mission to deliver\nscholarship, education and research.\u201c\nProfessor Kelly tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s my belief this is a unique combination that\nmakes universities very special.\u201d\nWhether you\u2019re undecided about\nyour future with research or careers;\ninterested in the technology that makes\ntoday\u2019s games tick; or simply want to\nbe in the same room as the guy who\ndressed Ian McKellen up in a polar\nbear suit, this year\u2019s Games and Media\nEvent is not to be missed.\nThe Games and Media Event is\nscheduled for the 21st of May in\nImperial\u2019s Huxley building. For\nmore information, surf to http://\nwww.doc.ic.ac.uk/game\nWhile a lot of GaME\u2019s lineup\nis still unconfirmed, a few announcements have been made.\nFirst up is Paul Miller from Rebellion \u2013 the development studio\nresponsible for, amongst other\nthings, Delta Force: Black Hawk\nDown and The Simpsons Game.\nHe\u2019ll be talking about artificial\nintelligence in games, and this\none\u2019s likely to be accessible even\nif you\u2019ve never touched a computer except to play games.\nA few industry-based talks\nhave been scheduled\nfrom middleware\ndevelopers such\nas Framestore, a\ncompany responsible for creating computer-gener-ated graphics such as those seen\npowering everyone\u2019s favourite\nPolar-bear King, Iorek of The\nGolden Compass fame.\nTheir talk \u2013 Tools and Techniques for Visual Effects \u2013 should\nprove a fascinating insight into\nsome of today\u2019s cutting-edge\nvisual work. Plus, hopefully, more\nclips of the bear.\nIn a similar vein, graphics and\nlighting company Geomerics will\nbe giving a talk on how academic\nresearch can be applied to industries such as gaming and graphics \u2013 of particular interest to people who might be considering\napplying their scientific skills to\nthe media industries, or indeed\nto the polar bear industry.\nFor the more technologically-oriented, there are plenty of\nmore meaty talks to be had too.\nAmong the confirmed is Codeplay\u2019s Andrew Richards who\u2019ll\nbe discussing multi programming and some solutions that\nCodeplay have come up with.\nCodeplay\u2019s work includes some\nincredible auto-par-allelising technolo-gies, so this is sure\nto be a worthwhile\nwatch.\nAnd there's more \u2013 the head of\nImperial's Software Performance\nOptimisation Group will be giving a mind-expanding talk; cofounder of Games Workshop and\nall-round entrepreneur, Eidos' Ian\nLivingstone; and Kuju Studios'\nAdrian Hawkins will be talking\nabout the industry skills shortage\n\u2013 and how you could plug it.\nWith more confirmations still\nto come, your best bet to keep\nabreast is to visit http://www.\ndoc.ic.ac.uk/game. You can also\nregister for the event there, and\nlook back on previous lineups.\nMichael Cook\nGaME 2008: The schedule so far...\n\n"

The fact\nthat there were no complaints regarding the previous 'Finance tart' article\ncan be easily explained \u2013 finance tart\nis an exaggerated fiction and not a real,\nidentifiable group. The fact that the\nfootball club is constantly being singled out among all of the varied groups\nthat exist at IC is the issue at hand.\nWhat you fail to realise when you lash\nWhere is the line\ndrawn?\nT\nhis week I am writing in\nthe name of the oppressed.\nIn the name of those who\nare not permitted to convey their message directly,\nand who rely on people like myself to\ndo it for them.\nI am writing to complain about unfair discrimination which is still omnipresent in the workplace. The oft-overlooked emoticon industry still\nemploys scandalously out-of-date hiring practices, and equal opportunity is\nan unheard-of concept.\nRecent research indicates that in well\nover 90% of e-mails, text messages and\nfacebook correspondences, the clich\u00e9d\n'smiley-face' is the preferred emoticon.\nSurely we can all agree that in today's\nworld, this is outrageous. Usage of\nemoticons should not be based solely\non looks, but rather on the ability of\nthe symbol in question to convey the\ndesired emotion.\nDo we, in fact, all feel happy all the\ntime, as my research seems to suggest?\nMost certainly not. We are merely\ntrapped in a society where the only\nacceptable emoticon to use is the Pacman-esque smiley.\nShould one be so forward-thinking\nas to provide gainful employment to a\nless permanently-cheerful set of punctuation marks, one is immediately regarded as dangerous and subversive.\nSuch attitudes have to stop. In a world\nwhere emotions are infinitely more\ncomplex than mere 'happiness', we\nshould be allowed to run the full gamut\nof these in expressing the way we feel.\nAnd yet, even in the emotionally\ncomplex world in which we live and\ntype, we stereotype and apply the most\nvirulent forms of prejudice to these circular faces. What about the 'confused'\nand 'sarcastic' smileys on offer in Windows Messenger? Can anyone honestly\nclaim to know the difference between\nthem?

Personally\nI feel this is a good thing. It facilitates\nthe exchange of ideas and helps us to\nunderstand each other\u2019s culture better.\nNonetheless it has highlighted some\nmajor difference between a \u201cChinese\nview\u201d and a \u201cWestern view\u201d.\nCurrently there is a ferocious online\nbattle going on in various forums. One\nside is the \u201cFree Tibet\u201d camp, highlighting not just Tibet but a whole range of\nissues involving China such as human\nrights; on the other side is the \u201cTibet\nis always part of China\u201d camp, made\nup mainly of those of Chinese origin.\nBoth sides have thrown up pretty good\nrational arguments (amid even more\nirrational and emotional outcries). It\nwould be too long and too difficult to\ngo through them, besides, my good\nfriend Kadhim has already done a\npretty good analysis on the Tibet issue.\nWhat I am going to do instead is to explain the way we Chinese think about\nthis whole thing and also highlight\nsome key differences between western\nand Chinese point of view.\nOn Tibet, there are huge gaps between the two camps at the moment.\n\u201cFree Tibet\u201d camps accuse the Chinese\nof being brainwashed by Communist\npropaganda and choosing to ignore the\nissues in Tibet; in return, the activists\nare being accused of ignorance of the\nhistory between China and Tibet (thus\nthe overly abused question used \u201cDo\nyou even know where Tibet is?\u201d). This\nonly shows the clear prejudices each\nside has against the other. Although a\nlot of the activists are being emotional\nor just \u201cjumping on the bandwagon\u201d,\nmany activists have actually been to\nTibet and China and are pretty well\ninformed on the issue. Equally, not all\nChinese are brainwashed. Overseas\nChinese have unrestricted access to\nBBC, CNN, various Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan media, even net\nusers in China regularly use foreign\nproxy servers to circumvent the Chinese government\u2019s online filter and\nthus gain full access to foreign media.\nHence many people are puzzled as to\nwhy overseas Chinese, having enjoyed\nthe western freedom of speech and access to free media, are still defending\nan \u201coppressive\u201d regime. This is a complex issue, and there are many different\nreasons. But it ultimately boils down to\na clash of culture and values.\nMany western people point out that\nthey are not protesting against the Chinese, merely the Chinese government\nhosting the Olympics, and cannot understand why it offends the Chinese\nso much. If you dig deeper, you will\nfind it is impossible to for us to distinguish between the two. The host of the\nGames is not actually the Chinese government but Beijing, a Chinese city.\nThus, in our eyes, hosting the Games\ndoes not symbolise the achievement of\nthe government, but rather that of the\nChinese people. To deny us this privilege is to deny the achievement of our\nculture and of our people. If you break\ninto a wedding and accuse the bridegroom of murder, you should not expect gratitude from the guests.\nThe perceived \u201cbiased reporting\u201d\nfrom the western media and from pro-Tibetan camps does not help to dispel\nthis illusion either. I am not expert\nenough to comment on the factual\ntruth of the media reporting. However,\nI think all media consider the taste of\ntheir audience base and they use sensational headlines to grab the attention\nof its readership. Really, no-one wants\nto hear dull stories about a bunch of\nChinese flag-waving enthusiasts welcoming the Olympic Torch. Thus, in\nthe cases where pro-China and pro-Tibetan supporters are numerically\nequal, pro-Tibetan protesters would of\ncourse get a bigger slice of the media\npie.\nIn the same way, the media concentrated on the \u201cmassive military presence\u201d in the Lhasa riots, while the Han\nChinese murdered are merely \u201cdisplays\nof anger\u201d by the Tibetans. So of course\nwe Chinese feel prejudiced against by\nthe western media. Sure, Beijing\u2019s refusal to allow foreign journalists to\nfreely report in Tibet is partly to blame.\nBut from the way the western media\nleaned toward pro-Tibetan protests in\nthe Torch Relay, Beijing is not going to\ntrust them to report the whole truth.\nAs for the perceived prejudice by the\nmajority of westerners against our gov-ernment, I understand its cause but I\nfeel frustrated at its outcome. Most of\nthe westerners have very strong ethical\nfeelings, and I applaud that. But we feel\nthat various NGOs over-exploited this\nto their advantage. Is the Chinese government really the sort of \u201cNazi\u201d-style\noppressor that many NGOs portray it\nto be? I would like to point out that although these NGOs exist to promote\nnoble causes, they are not going to\nachieve their goal by highlighting the\nprogresses in China. They grab the attention of the public by sensationalis-ing the issue, highlighting only part\nof the whole story, taking facts out of\ncontext or sometimes distorting disputed facts, anything just short of outright lying really.\nAs for the Chinese media, many\nwesterners merely dismiss it as propa-ganda. This is only partly true. The\nstate-controlled media is heavily cen-sored, but there are many regional media groups that offer robust opinions.\nAn example would be the Southern\nMetropolis Daily editor Chang Ping\u2019s\nessay of 3 April, \u201cHow To Find The\nTruth About Lh\u0430sa,\u201d in which he cri-tised the governments\u2019 decision to not\nallow free coverage of Tibet riots. (As\nfar as I know he is still the editor of the\nsaid paper). This stirred a fierce debate\nin China, with pro- and anti-media-control camps battling it out in various media outlets. Clearly it is not true\nthat there is zero free speech in China,\nit is just our atitude towards true free\nspeech is different.\nI don\u2019t deny that China has got tons\nof human rights issues, but to what extent have the actions of these NGOs\nchanged the situation in China? With\nthe political situation in China, are\nthese NGO protests really in the best\ninterest of the common Chinese and\nTibetan people, or do they just protest\nto make themselves feel good? Can\nnoble causes really be furthered by aggressive protests in a country outside\nChina, or does the more subtle \u201cquietdiplomacy\u201d work better?\nAs a result, most Chinese feel deeply\nsuspicious of these NGOs; they have\nnot earned our respect. On the con-trary, their actions have forced us to\nre-assess our loyalties and in most\ncases re-align ourselves with our gov-ernment. I don\u2019t like to say I agree with\nBeijing\u2019s policies, because I don\u2019t. But\nby over-exploiting this \u201call-stick-andno-carrots\u201d tactic, we are all led to feel\nthat the western NGOs are against\nprogress in China in general. Maybe\nNGOs should retune their image to\nbroaden their appeals?\nOn the other hand, we do feel that\nthe Chinese government has made\nvast progress in recent years. In poverty reduction, hundreds of millions of\npeople are being lifted out of poverty\ndue to the economic boom. In environ\u201cNGOs should\nretune their\nimage to\nbroaden their\nappeal\u201d\nThe Olympic torch has been greeted with celebrations in China\nThe Olympic Stadium in Beijing, often referred to as the \u2018Birds Nest\u2019. The Chinese people are deeply proud of their cities success in holding the 2008 Olympics\n\n"

We sent Caz Knight to the Shad Thames to find out why\nTop: Rogers\u2019 gorgeously structured and curvaceous design for Barajas airport and Bottom: The epically industrial Lloyd\u2019s building in the City\nH\nitherto, unchartered\nterritory for me. And\nso I arrived at the Design Museum many\nboroughs away from\nmy SW bubble in the orient; that is, in\nShad Thames.\nThe Design Museum resides in the\nshadow of Tower Bridge and is in one\nof the most pleasant and well-situated\nlocations for a museum. The Design\nmuseum is nestled among winding\ncobbled streets right on the South\nBank and sits quietly along the river\nnext to an inviting collection of bistros\nand bars.\nI had little idea of what to expect\nfrom either the museum or the new\nexhibition, \u201cRichard Rogers and Architects: From the House to the City\u201d,\nbut upon entering the museum I did\nfeel as if I epitomised the more adult\nequivalent of \u201cchild in a sweet shop/toy\nstore\u201d! The museum certainly looks\nas if Apple lent a hand with the decor:\nuncluttered, white-walled, minimal,\nairy and with just the right amount of\nbright neon colour splashed about the\nplace. Upon entering the exhibition,\nmy awe only deepened as I beheld an\nimmaculately laid-out presentation of\nthe life work of Richard Rogers (and\nArchitects).\nOne of the leading names in archi-tecture, Richard Rogers is of both Italian and English extraction and began\nhis career working on a private house\nin Cornwall, a far cry from the international creations he now has in his\nrepertoire.\nMoving onto the Pompidou building in Paris in the late seventies, he has\nsince worked on projects all over the\nglobe including my favourite, Barajas\nterminal building in Madrid (a serpen-tine, undulating building, the inside\nresembling a remnant vertebrae of an\nancient stegosaurus), housing in Korea\n(which look curiously like a Jenga game\nmade out of white Rubik\u2019s cubes), stadiums in Japan, the Millennium Dome\n(on time and on budget \u2013 is this a first\nin British history?), the South Bank\ncentre, Heathrow terminal five as well\nas the work in progress on Ground\nZero. Rogers\u2019 work at Ground Zero is\none of five new towers to be built at the\nsite, and not to be confused with Daniel Libeskind\u2019s monumental Freedom\nTower.\nRogers\u2019 main focus is the process of construction, and how it fits in\nwith people and the buildings\u2019 social\ncontext. This was extremely clear as\nI worked my way around the seven\nthemed areas of the exhibition: Work\ninProgress,Transparent,Systems,Leg-ible, Lightweight, Green, Urban. Each\nsection is beautifully colour coded and\nprevents people with pitiful knowledge\nof design and architecture feeling clueless and baffled. What the exhibition is\ncomprised of is just that: the life work\nof this indispensable architect.\nIt has amazingly constructed mini-recreations of the buildings, photographs and the final products and the\nworks in progress, blueprints as well\nas concise articles on the background\nbehind each creation. I marveled at the\ntiny, silver trees that accessorised the\nmodel buildings, and the red Perspex\ntoilet and sinks in another, all complete\nwith appropriately proportioned model people. All the information is displayed attractively on large Apple Mac\nscreens, free from the burden of superfluous wiring and cumbersome hard-ware. (PC\u2019s have so much to learn!)\nAs I meandered my way through each\n\u201ctheme\u201d I became evermore confused\nabout my feelings towards these con-structions. This is a man who has an\ninvaluable talent and is abundant in his\nprofessionalism and ability to conjure\nup buildings that are extremely efficient and beneficial to society through\ntheir function.\nHowever, they all seemed to be made\nof glass and metal, not pleasing to the\neye in any way. I yearned to see something that reminded me that we live in\na world made of wood, grass and stone.\nAlas, I must accept that, although frus-trating, modernisation is unavoidable\nand although it may be a lot more\nagreeable to live in cute Cotswolds cot-tages, a decline in economy and infrastructure is not an option.\nHowever, Rogers is extremely aware\nof the environmental effect of build-ings. In his project (in conjunction\nwith Imperial College, no less) he has\ndesigned a turbine tower in which the\nenvironment has been used as an architectural generator. In many of his\nbuilding the use of glass has minimised\nthe amount of energy needed to heat\nthe building in winter, as well as the energy needed to cool it in summer.\nOf Heathrow Terminal 5 is written,\n\u201c\u2026a single span curved roof over the\n400m long hall, instilling a sense of\ncalm on the intense activity below\u201d. I\nwonder if Rogers knew just how much\nintense activity (i.e. pandemonium/\nchaos/Bedlam) would ensue following\nits opening and just how many bags\nwere lost and flights cancelled. Obviously his roof was not enough to prevent Heathrow doing exactly what we\nexpected.\nThe room in which the exhibition\nis housed is relatively small compared\nwith other museums, although one can\neasily spend over an hour and a half\nworking one\u2019s way around it. For those\nwho falter, there are some deliciously\ncoloured neon pink sofas with magazines and books on the man himself to\nbrowse through. There is also a video\ninterview to watch in which I discovered it was the amalgamation of science and art which drove his passion\nfor his chosen discipline.\nIf I were Rogers, I would feel an intense sense of pride in seeing how\nmuch I had achieved in the way of\nhow important my projects are and in\nhow beneficial they are. No whimsi-cal, pointless structures deposited un-imaginatively in a town square to tick\nthe box of \u2018art/culture\u2019, nor hoards of\nhouses to satisfy the wealthy (although\nhe has designed two). Richard Rogers\nis indeed a blessing to architecture\nthough he may be a curse to aesthetics.\nSurely this is more important than aesthetics and one architecturally bereft\ngirl\u2019s opinion?\n\n"

The full essays are available at www.rcsu.org.uk/sciencechallenge, but we thought you'd\nlike a taster. Meanwhile, in the lower left, Andrew Somerville gives you his impressions of the evening\nO\nn the final Tuesday of\nthe spring term, the\nScience Museum's\nImax cinema was\nalmost filled to capacity with students, guests and the\ndistinguished panel of judges as the\nfinalists of this year's (formerly RCSU)\nScience Challenge gave presentations\non their essays. The Science Challenge\nis rapidly becoming one of Imperial's\nflagship annual events (being born\nonly three years ago) as exemplified\nthis year by the huge sponsorship by\nShell, high-profile judges and fantastic\nlocation in the Science Museum.\nThis year saw over 360 entries from\nboth IC students and school and college students across the country in\nthe two competitions. The IC prize\nwent to Erika Cule, on the essay title\n\"How would knowledge of my genetic\nmakeup affect my lifestyle?\" \u2013 the\nquestion set by our own Rector, Sir\nRichard Sykes. The Schools prize went\nto Hassan Al Halwachi of Sherborne\nSchool on the topic of \"To what extent\nis geo-engineering the solution to the\nclimate change problem?\" set by Sir\nBrian Hoskins.\nFollowing the presentations and\nspeeches from the winners, the Rector, and Science Challenge committee\nchair, Daniel Burrows, the crowd adjourned to the main Science Museum\nhall for the other main attraction:\nthe after-party. The event was lively,\nmany students taking advantage of the\nopportunity to rub shouilders with\nthe distinguished guests panellists\nsuch as Sir Robert Winston, and avail\nthemselves of the open bar.\n\"I'm very pleased\", said Daniel\nBurrows, \"We set out to get beyond\na science essay, and look beyond\nthe statistics... the communication\nis empty without the science, but\nthe science is useless without good\ncommunication.\"\nAs one of the finalists, IC PhD\nstudent Anna Gustavssen, put it:\n\"The purpose of publicly funded\nscience is not for the self-realisation\nof scientists, but for them to communicate scientific discovery back to the\npublic.\" By those criteria, the Science\nChallenge has a valuable role to play\nin the future of science at IC.\nI\nt is clear that the way we choose\nto enhance ourselves matters. Few\npeople would object to parents\ngiving their children fish-liver oil. Yet\na recent study of school children with\ncertain learning disorders has shown\nthat omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids\n(found in fish oil) are as effective as\nRitalin for improving reading, spelling\nand behaviour. Other ways of improving cognitive function include regular\nexercise, memory training courses\nand regular sleep. Again, the neurological mechanisms for these\nimprovements are not understood.\nBut there remains an ethical difference between enhancing oneself\nthrough these conventional means\nand taking cognitive enhancing drugs.\nWhy is that?\nPerhaps our unease about\ncognitive enhancement\ndrugs has to do with the\nway we see ourselves.\nThere is a strong connection between brain\nand mind, and between\nmind and self. Serious\nethical problems arise\nwhen we reduce our consciousness to\na series of chemical reactions that we\ncan influence directly.\nGenetic engineers struggle with\nmany similar ethical questions related\nto the implications of modifying the\nessence of self. Some are starting to\naddress this issue using complexity\ntheory, in which it is asserted that\nwe are more than just the sum of\nour parts. Consciousness is similarly\na subtle and complex phenomenon\nthat may also need to be treated from\na non-reductionist point of view. Perhaps the real underlying question is\nhow these cognitive drugs affect the\noverall pattern of our consciousness \u2013\nand whether this change is desirable.\nAnna Gustavsson\nIgnoring the legalities\u2014methylphenidate is a Class B drug\u2014if you can\nget them, the scientific data suggest\nthat cogs [cognitive enhancing drugs]\nare efficacious. In recent tests, methylphenidate improved spatial working\nmemory and planning in fatigued, but\notherwise healthy, people , although\nthere are some indications that the\nincrease in speed causes a greater\nnumber of errors. Similar research with\nmodafinil has also found improved\ncognitive ability. The results are not\nuniversally positive\u2014some tests have\nshown no significant improvement\ncompared to placebo \u2014but the balance of evidence seems to suggest that\nthese drugs can improve performance\nin at least some aspects.\nSafety, however, is a more contentious matter. In particular, the discussion must be mediated by the fact that\nthe pharmaceutical industry, as it currently operates, focuses exclusively\non sick people, since historically this\nhas been the group of people most\ninterested in medication. The inevitable consequence of this is that it\nis very difficult to assess safety for\nhealthy individuals.\nAll drugs, without exception, produce side effects\u2014common side effects experienced with Ritalin include\ninsomnia, headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms \u2014but these are considered against the alternative course of\naction: to not medicate the patient at\nall. Therefore, when a drug is licensed\nfor the treatment of a given condition,\nit has been determined that in most instances the benefit to the patient will\noutweigh the impact of the adverse ef-fects. The aim is to return the patient\nto as close to \u2018normal functioning\u2019 as\npossible. So if the side effects take the\npatient further from this goal than\nthe benefits take them towards it, the\ndrug is not helpful. Drugs for healthy\npeople, however, have a much more\nnebulous target. What is \u2018better than\nnormal functioning\u2019? Are any adverse\nside effects acceptable when medicating healthy people?\nAndrew Turley\nScience Challenge: The excerpts\nD\nr Nakasone indulges in rather\ntoo many espressos to propel\nhim through the day. The active\ningredient, caffeine, acts on the same\ndopamine system as methylphenidate\n[Ritalin] to increase wakefulness, and\nhas gained widespread popularity\nand acceptance worldwide. Today, coffee is second only to\npetroleum in world trade. So,\nhaving taken a step in the direction of cognitive enhance-ment, would Dr Nakasone\never take drugs other than\ncaffeine to improve his cognitive skills?\nHe has some concerns. Cognitive enhancing drugs provide meagre\nbenefits to healthy people, yet they\nhave marked short-term side effects,\nand the long term effects are largely\nunknown. In particular, no studies\nhave assessed what happens when people stop taking the drugs. As he makes\nhimself yet another espresso to stave\noff his tiredness, he is reminded of the\ntime when a single one would have kept\nhim awake for hours on end. Could\nthe same tolerance develop in people\ntaking drugs to improve their cognitive function? He also has reservations\nabout the social impact of these drugs.\nCould they widen the divide between\nthose that can afford them and those\nthat cannot? In fact,\nthese drugs appear to\nwork best on those\nwith poorer cognitive abilities, which\nare likely to be those\nwithout the benefit\nof a good education.\nIronically, education itself is considered the safest\nand most effective form of cognitive enhancement.\nWith all this in mind, Dr Nakasone\nchooses to stick to his coffee. In fact,\nhe might consider switching to decaf.\nLeili Farzaneh\nShould healthy people take drugs to enhance\ntheir cognitive abilities?\n1. Leili Farzaneh points out that cognitive\nenhancing drugs are already used by students\nand pilots\n2. Dan Burrows: science proselytizer\nextraordinaire.

A total of nine\nuniversities and nineteen competitors\ntook part in what is hoped to be the\nfirst of many such competitions. The\ncompetitors fought for medals in nine\ncategories which included open hand,\nweapons, fight sets, taiji, and traditional forms.\nHaving spent most of the day before\nhauling around more than half a tonne\nof mats and carpets, the Imperial team\nwere understandably fatigued. Still, we\nall arrived early and excited. The huge\ncarpet was laid out in the middle of the\nsports hall looking quite majestic. For\nthose who have no idea what competitive Wushu is, athletes perform various\nroutines on a 14m by 8m carpet. The\ncarpet is there mostly for safety, since\nlanding in splits or on knees can be\nquite painful on a wooden floor. Athletes were given a warm-up area at the\nside of the hall to stretch and prepare.\nAfter a brief speech from the head\njudge, the competition began at\naround 11am with Chang Quan (long\nfist). Imperial scored one silver and\none bronze. This was followed by the\nNan Quan (southern fist) category,\nwhich brought with it energetic performances from Queen Mary, King\u2019s\nCollege, and Leeds Metropolitan. The\nevent was won by Mitchell Pallet of\nQueen Mary who is also the current\nGB southern sword champion.\nAfter the power and shouting of Nan\nQuan came a welcome peace in the\nform of Taiji (that\u2019s the proper pinyin\nway of spelling Tai chi). Shaopeng Li\nof Imperial received the gold thanks to\nhis masterfully performed routine.\nThe traditional category came next.\nThis proved to be really interesting\nand was the category with the most\ncompetitors, performing a variety of\nroutines from different branches of\nChinese martial arts. Luke Sanders of\nSouthampton University amazed everyone with his Di Tang Quan (Ground\nboxing)whichinvolvedpainful-looking\nfalls and flips. The gold went to Allan\nMartin of Imperial who performed a\npowerful rendition of Da Hong Quan,\na Shaolin form.\nAfter the lunch break we were treated\nto a performance by Sam Mak, the current world junior straightsword cham-pion. He displayed a level of Wushu\nrarely seen in the UK.\nNext came the advanced long and\nshort weapons, intermediate weapons\nand taiji sword categories. Intermediate weapons was a rather odd category;\ndue to the lack of competitors in this\nevent, all three competitors were from\nImperial. No prizes for guessing which\nuniversity won that event.\nThe advanced categories, however,\nwere simply amazing. Both the long\nand short weapon events showed the\nskill and athleticism of some of the\nUK\u2019s best. Both events were won by\nScott Pallet of King\u2019s College, current\nGB national team member with two\nhigh-flying, amazing routines.\nThe competition ended with the Dui\nLian (fighting set) category. Imperial\nwere up first, with Adam and Jamshid\nand their largely improvised made-up-at-lunch-time spear vs. three section\nstaff fight. Next came the team from\nUniversity of East Anglia. They performed a long and highly imaginative\nspear vs. empty hand fight. However,\nvictory went to the combined LSE-IC\nduo Zoe and Liane Athill with their\nspear vs. double swords fight, in which\nLiane suffered a slight facial injury.\nWhile waiting for the award-giving\nceremony, Sam Mak graced us with another demonstration, this time he performed an excellent drunken straight-sword routine.\nAt the end, all the athletes lined up\non the carpet according to university.\nThe medals and certificates were given\nout and Imperial\u2019s Shaopeng Li bagged\nthe all-round award, having achieved\n2 gold medals and 1 silver medal, the\nhighest among all competitors.\nIt is hoped that this will become a\nyearly event from now on. We were\nvery impressed with the spirit of\ncompetition displayed by everyone\npresent.\nWe\u2019d also like to thank everyone that\nmade this event possible: the Union,\nSport Imperial and to our sponsors -IC Trust, Oriental City Supermarket,\nChina Arts and New World Chinese\nrestaurant. A big thank you to you all.\nAfter all, it\u2019s not about winning med-als, it\u2019s about getting out on that carpet and doing the best you can. As Jet\nLi\u2019s character Huo Yuan Jia said in the\nmovie Fearless , \u201cThrough competition\nwe can discover ourselves\u201d.\nAdam Omar\nA spear versus empty hand fight from the East Anglia team\n\n"

They are just different.\nB: I like the bigger shows where you\ncan jump our and crowdsurf and get\ncrazy with everybody.\nWhat\u2019s the biggest show you\u2019ve\nplayed so far?\nL: 4000?\nB: We toured with Queens of the Stone\nAge for a while, so there were probably\nabout 5000 people at those shows. That\nwas cool, 5000 is good enough for me.\nL: It\u2019s so cool at those big shows opening for big bands, we enjoy it probably\nas much as everybody else does, so\nwe\u2019ll go out there in the mosh pit. People are so surprised to see us out mosh-ing with everybody else.\nB: There\u2019s no reason to set yourself\napart, I\u2019m just as much a Queens of the\nStone Age fan as everyone else.\nL: Queens of the Stone Age were really\ngood, really nice to us. That was the\nfirst big tour we\u2019ve been on, and they\nkind of took us under their wing.\nB: Yeah man we had no fucking clue.\nWe\u2019d done spot shows for a couple of\nbands, but we\u2019re still a pretty young\nband. We\u2019ve only been together for a\nyear and a couple months.\nHow did you come together to\nform the band?\nB: Me, Matt and Jared had been playing music together since we were in\nhighschool. Me and Matt are brothers.\nJared, we\u2019ve been jamming with him\nsince we were like 16 years old. We\nwere in this other band, and one of our\nplayers went AWOL, and another one\ndecided to quit and do his own thing,\nso we got together with Titchner who\nhad never played bass before. He plays\nguitar. We knew him through our dad\nand all the things that our parents used\nto do together. So we were out one\nnight and Titchner was wasted and he\nwas like \u201cLet me try out for the band!!\u201d.\nWe were like \u201cCan you play bass?\u201d And\nhe was like \u201cYeah yeah I can play bass\u201d.\nHe goes out and buys a bass the next\nday, comes to band practice and he\u2019s\nabsolutely horrible. I talked to Matt \u2013\n\u201cDude let\u2019s give him a chance to practise up. So a week later he comes in,\nblows the roof off the place. I was like\n\u201cHoly shit\u201d. Seriously, I couldn\u2019t believe\nit. Now you listen to his bass lines, and\nthey are so complicated. I don\u2019t know\nhow he caught on so fast but he did it.\nThen Lincoln, he was just this 15-year-old kid that kept hitting us up on the\ninternet \u2013 \u201cHey guys lemme try out for\nyour band\u201d. Jared was like \u201cFuck that.\nI\u2019m not gonna be in a band with 15, 16\nyear old.\u201d We were 22 at the time.\nL: I had just turned 16.\nB: So that\u2019s when he first tried out, we\nkind of jammed together and then we\njust became a band after that. Started\nwriting new material, then we were\nthought let\u2019s get into the studio and get\nthis whole thing started.\nL: We just jammed and they were like\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do these three demos\ntomorrow, why don\u2019t you come\u201d, and I\nwas like \u201cOK\u201d.\nB: That was the first time Lincoln really jammed with us a lot, besides coming over for like an hour and mucking\naround. I guess after we did that demo\nwe decided to be a band. Came up with\na name. That came through a conversation Matt had with somebody about\nsociety and, talking about the elephant\nand a lot of different religions. In a lot\nof different things, the elephant is held\nin a good light. People are always talking about the elephant\u2019s memory, So\nhim and a buddy were talking about\nhow society kind of resembles an elephant and how, not just the media\nbut everything in general tries to put\na cage on the elephant. They want to\ncage that goodness that everybody has\nin them.\nL: All you see on the news is negativie\ncrap..\nB: Yeah, you see war, three people got\ngunned down, five people got stabbed.\nYou don\u2019t hear about anything good,\nnothing. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it actually is, it\u2019s just what sells. It\u2019s consumption by fear. You\u2019re afraid that you\u2019re\ngonna get zits so what do you do? Go\nout and get some pimple cream. You\u2019re\nafraid that you\u2019re gonna get gunned\ndown so what do you do? Go out\nand get whatever you need to protect\nyourself. You\u2019re afraid that the world\nis gonna end so you go to the grocery\nstore and buy up as much canned food\nas you can, you know? There\u2019s so many\ndifferent ways to scare people, it\u2019s all\njust a marketing scheme.\nAre the lyrics geared towards that,\nor is that just the name?\nB: Matt talks about certain stuff, but\nit\u2019s not like he\u2019s preaching to anybody,\nsaying to anybody how to change their\nlives. It\u2019s just different thoughts that he\nhas. As far as lyrics are concerned, it\u2019s\njust thoughts that he has on life that\nhe\u2019d like to see happen in the world\nL: Social stuff\nB: Social stuff more than government\npolitics. It\u2019s more of a social comment.\nIt all starts with the people, they have\nthe power to do whatever they want.\nL: It\u2019s how he observes things\nCan you describe a typical fan?\nL: What I think is cool about our music\nis that it appeals to all different types of\npeople. Not everybodies the same, it\u2019s\npretty cool\nB: We mix a lot of different shit in our\nmusic. We get tagged as a rock and roll\nband, but we\u2019re not totally rock and\nroll music. We have different elements\nto our music. We\u2019re touching hip hop,\nwe\u2019re touching obviously rock and roll,\ntouching punk music, touching funk, a\nlittle bit of everything.\nAre you guys into hip-hop?\nL: Yeah man. Lupe Fiasco is badass.\nB: He\u2019s off the hook. I like a lot. NWA,\nPublic Enemy, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube.\nSnoop Dogg\u2019s older material. He got\nlost along the way. He needs to start\nsmoking pot again.\nWhat\u2019s the weirdest question\nyou\u2019ve ever been asked?\nL: Do you want some crack?\nB: We were staying at this backpacking\nplace when we played a show in Canada. North by north east, everybody in\na hostel.\nL: This chick followed us back to our\nroom and we were smoking a bowl,\nand she was like \u201cDo you want some\ncrack?\u201d Probably the craziest thing\nthat\u2019s ever happened was after a Koko\nshow, and this dude comes up to us as\nwas like \u201cHey man, want some coke?\u201d\nand I was like \u201cNah man, whatever\u201d,\nand he was like \u201cIf y\u2019all got any coke,\nI\u2019ve got some heroin to trade\u201d\nB: Haha, I was like \u201cDamn!\u201d\nL: Dude was straight up trying to get us\nsome heroin. I was like \u201cNo way.\u201d\nB: Most interesting questions we\u2019ve\nbeen asked in an interview\u2026lemme\nask Matt [opens the van and shouts to\nMatt] Matt! What\u2019s the most interesting question we\u2019ve been asked in an\ninterview. Most weird.\nM: The weirdest question we\u2019ve been\nasked in an interview was \u201cDo you\nmake any animal noises?\u201d Don\u2019t ask me\nwhy they asked that. I replied \u201cOnly\nwhile I masturbate\u201d That was the only\nanswer I could think of for that. How\ndo you answer a question like that?\n\u201cYes, actually I can make the sound of\na lion.\u201d\nCage the Elephant\u2019s guitarist looking every bit the Mr Rock and Roll\nThe band trapped in a small, dark room and absolutely loving it\nThe genre-crossing pop sensation that\nis Goldfrapp have released their fourth\nalbum, \u2018Seventh Tree\u2019, which sold over\n100,000 copies in the first week of re-lease. Quite something. This follows\nthe captivating, critically acclaimed,\nplatinum-selling album \u2018Supernature.\u2019\nGoldfrapp have delighted fans with\ntheir sheer diversity, from the electronic balladry of Mercury-nominated\ndebut \u2018Felt Mountain\u2019 (2000) to the\nswaggering dancefloor beast of an album \u2013 \u2018Black Cherry\u2019 (2003), continuously bringing fresh and dynamic takes\non the definition of true talent.\n\u2018Seventh Tree\u2019 is an electrifying\nmaelstrom of sound, with cushy at-Goldfrapp\nSeventh Tree\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nAlbum review\nGoldfrapp\u2019s Seventh Tree blossoms gloriously\nmospherics, over which Alison Goldfrapp\u2019s sublime sensual vocals soar ma-jestically. Her lush dreamy voice is as\nintoxicating as the overpowering scent\nof a rose, taking you to a dreamland of\ndesire and ecstasy, evoking images of\nthe Garden of Eden where everything\nshimmers with gold.\nThe album softly kicks off with\n\u2018Clowns,\u2019 a misty concoction of gentle acoustic guitar and string instrumentation complemented by equally\nsoothing, tender yet nearly incomprehensible vocals \u2013 \u2018Only clowns would\nplay with\u2026\u2019 One really does have to\nlisten very hard to decipher the lyrics.\nDoes it matter?

It will grip every listener with\nits gradual build-up, layered sound-scape, culminating with a euphonic\nspell in the chorus. Meanwhile, \u2018Caravan Girl,\u2019 a rare upbeat return to energy,\nwill have you swinging back and forth,\ntapping your foot and jumping to the\nreturn of the pop cosmic soup.\nLast but not least, \u2018Monster Love\u2019\nbrings together synthesisers and rich\nelectronics, reverberating against the\nunderlying rapid guitar riffs.
