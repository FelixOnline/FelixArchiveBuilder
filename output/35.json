    "content": "j tR Of ik FELIX\nRON MAC FIE Among the students a tI.C. is one with a quiet and confident manner and a pipe. The former is permanent, but the latter disappears at regular intervals when attempting to give up smoking. Ron first came to Guilds from Brom s grave School in1943 when he succeeded in failing Inter Physics and left to join the R.A.F. After a year or two driving on the Burma Road, and lifting Government property( with a Coles crane] he found the call of I.C. too strong and returned to Guilds in1947, where he proved his consistency by failing Inter Physics again. His determined nature however won through in the end and1952 finds him In\nthe Aeronautics Department as a3rd year student. Gliding is hie. main sporting interest and during his term of office as Captain from19491951 the I.C. Gliding Club became established on a firm footing with dual instruction and many active members. He\nhas obtained an International Silver C gliding certificate, represented I.C. in the National Gliding[ Competitions in'49 and'51 and went to Sweden with the British Gliding team in1950. As the first member of the I. C.G.C. to become a flying instructor, while still a student, he now spends most of his weekends training the new members. Ron has also discovered an interesting and remunerative form of vac work in driving the aristocracy around the countryside. His main problem a ea chauffeur was learning to accept tips but he i now manages to do this with an air of years of[ experience. His main likes are girls, Guinness, green cheese and playing the recorder( he obtained al st prize in the recent Bromley musical festival), his dislikes are unknown since he is always too courteous to express them. As Chairman of the Social Clubs Committee this year he has finished most of the meetings in record time which says much for his efficiency as an administrator. We hope he will still be with usa tI.C. next year and wish him all the best forth se future. CARNIVAL PUDDING What magic is held in the word' Carnival'; what visions of soft lights on gay, colourful scenes of Paris, Arabia, the East or old world charm and courtesy; what thoughts of exotically arranged butterflies dancing tant all s ln gly fast out of reach; what cream of soothing music J This pudding which tastes so sweet, how Is lt made to appeal to all palates? Still lingering in the mouth Is the flavour of the' Naughty Nineties' tart, made with many\ngood ingredients but not very well cooked, the plums and lemon peel were too pronounced. The\ncontrast between the cardboard orust and the fruit in the centre was too great especially as the sweetening of informality was lost in the starch of shirt fronts. Some of the gar nl shl ngs, though well cooked In themselves and appropriate hors d'oe uvres, were not quite palatable as sweet. Served on the same evening was the Jamaica Rum barb a a colossal goulash of everything in the kitchen. Imagine, if you can, a winkle, strawberries and cream, roast duck and green peas, apple charlotte, mixed grill, ms rl ngu es and mussels, fumbled together on one plate and you have lt not quite sure wher^ to start or of the speed of approach of the inevitable end. However, the fastidious had a remarkably goodtime even if their fingers were soiled extracting the delicacies. Remembered as a dream or nightmare, depending upon one's resistance is the Magic Carpet Compote, of peaches, pears, cherries and tropical fruits floating in a bowl of champagne deliciously served amid skilfully executed masterpieces of decorations all so smooth that we never tired of just one more morsel dipped in the nectar of the nonstop melody. The blending took many an anxious week, all slightly inferior products were rejected on the grounds of incompatibility, too overbearing to be eaten for six hours, not enough scope for Individual dress and several for being too starchy or too sticky. That lucky charm in the middle of the pudding the cabaret a sober home -made bun is far more suited to our tastes than any shop bought bun in the window, e' clair and none better at all than a poor one.( The author Is ak lt chen handsome what biased. Ed.) IN HOT PURSE WERT Tuesday,1.10 p.m. On Tuesday it hailed and a lady of I. C.W. A. dropped her keys in the drain.S he enquired at the Union Office the correct procedure for such property lost; and then showed her keen qui vive by obtaining i magnet and fishing for it. Partial success with this brought the keys as far as under the drain grille, but they fell again before getting out. Reinforcements from I. C.W. A. and agent in the shape of Mr. D. Crossley helped, but didn't improve the situation; finally Joe and the Borough Council were brought in. what they dug up is still being f aught for between biology departments, but among them were the keys. News in Brief. The Guilds beat the Miners140 in the Engineers Rugger Cup.\nThe R.G. S. beat the Guilds98 at Rugger and so\nretained the Sparkes Cup. We congratulate J. Raw i oz on being awarded a full purple for Rugby.\nMUSIC IN I.C. Last term ended with several concerts given jy our own Musical Society mej nb ers. The choir gave their second concert under the direction of Dr. Jacques. This was a very pleasant evening's music and it seems that whatever happens at rehearsal the I.e. choir always rises to the occasion and gives really worthwhile performances at its concerts. The Thursday concert on the same day was given largely by I.C. members and I would suggest that these concerts are more important to us as a college than those given by outside artists. The more people we can get, who are willing to come forward and perform in front of their fellows, the more we shall dispel the idea of a culture less I.C.. The orchestra was \" at home\" to its friends one evening and showed us the fruits of the term's labour. The evening continued with various items, including some singing by a small quartet group. I understand that more will be heard from them one Thursday this term. As readers of this column will realise, the Musical Society is very active in the college, and the spring term may be sum med up as being very successful. D \u00bb R JAQUE S It is with pleasure that Felix welcomes Dr. Jacque stoI.C. not only( as was announced in Felix No.24) as Conductor of I.C. Choir but now as a member\nof the Academic Staff. He comes as( part time) Centenary Fund Special Lecturer( Arts). He has a room in the Guilds but his appointment is anI.C. appointment. He expects to be in college about two days a week, and, we are told, will welcome enquiries either on the subject of his current series of lectures, viz.\" The History and Appreciation of Music\"( being given to l st year Engineering students), or on any other relevant subject. Dr. Jacques is known all over Britain as a conductor of orchestras and choirs, and in particular he. is known for his interest in young people and their music Quite patently he has been conducting the National Youth Orchestra. Perhaps he is best known in London for his conductor ship of the Bach Choir and, with the Jacques Orchestra, for his annual performances of, the St. Matthew Passion at the Albert Hall. The desire for' more liberal studies nowadays is very noticeable. The appointment of Dr. Jacques is a sign of the times. THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND in the UNIVERSITY OF LONDON\nSummer Term The Service of Holy Communion for Imperial College at8.45 a.m.on Wednesday,7 th. May,1952 In Holy Trinity Church, Prince Consort- Road\nThere will be a short address by the Bishop's Chaplain to the University^ It will be possible to obtain a light breakfast afterwards in the Refectory.

    "content": "FELIX MIDDLESEX SEVENS Every Easter when the weather Is at Its hottest, I.C. joins battle with the giants for death or glory; In, our case the honour of playing at Twickenham in the final rounds. On Saturday,19 th April, on the Old Ml ll hill lans ground atP inner In sweltering heat, I.C. soon defeated Vauxhall Motors II. No sooner was the ball In play when an orthodox three quarter movement gave usan easy try, followed by another a few moments later. With6 points up, great tactical use was made of the touch line. In the second round Hoover pressed hard, doing everything but score for the first few minutes. I.C. pulled themselves together, taking the ball to within5 yards of Hoover's line where a series of de moral ising scrum s were endured, and from which, as a result of hearty congratulations, a rather dubious try was awarded by the corner flag. The kicker then showed that we really could score goals, converting the try with ease. Hoover then went to pieces, allowing I.C. to win150. During this game Spooner' s knee grow to an enormous size but he gamely went forward Into the third round against P inner.Most of this gam s was spent in P inner' s half with I.C.e ver on the attack but with half a man short just unable to score. The breakthrough of the nippy p inner three s was a constant menace, but the I.C. forwards rose to the occasion and went with wings to bring them down short of the line. Just before no side P inner' swing eluded Spooner who by now could barely walk, and after a thrilling chase the whole length of the field, crossed the line for the only score. In the fourth round a very tired P inner was no match for the more robust0. Ml ll hl ll lans. If I.C. wish for greater achievements In this sphere the7 s. must betaken more seriously with adequate training for several weeks prior to the competition. One run in the park is not enough to ensure the high degree of cooperation and anticipation essential for success. EASTER HOCKEY The season was closed for I.C. Hockey Club In a most admirable manner. The l st XI plus sundry reserves entertained a Dutch student team from the\" Forward Hockey Club\", Groningen University, whilst both teams played In a Festival at the National Physical Laboratory, Te ddl ngt on. Both teams were placed In the Premier Division of the Festival and consequently each had strong fixtures. The Dutchmen were unlucky to have to play with a reserve forward line. The result was that their strong defence was usually harassed and worried Into making mistakes, as the results showed, I.C., however, with10 members of the first team available, kept an unbeaten record In the4 matches and my be pleased with the results. Of all the games played, perhaps it la most fitting to pick out the I. C.v. Groningen match for comment. This was considered the big match by the Dutchmen( and perhaps by I. C.aswell), and so everybody was rather satisfied with the result. Groningen scored their goal halfway through the first half and their defence very nearly did the rest. Attack after attack by the I.C. forwards and halves was broken up and It was not until the last minute that the vital equal ising goal was scored. Truly the hardest game of the season for I.C. Although a lot of hockey was played, the social side of the visit was by no means\nneglected. A reception, sherry party and dance were held on10 th April In the Old Lounge and a farewell dinner held on16 th April in a WestEnd Chinese restaurant. In between these two alcoholic end pieces stand mighty memories of bacchanalian evenings at Te ddl ngt on, trips to the\" Prospect of Whitby\", g in parties In the Hostel and sightseeing around the Tower, St. Paul's, the Abbey and other historic buildings. The Club received as farewell presents a blue and white silk pennant and a Delft china plate. The members of the team each received a miniature bottle of g in from their Dutch counterparts. The entertainment of the visitors as described above was made possible by a generous grant of money by the Athletic Clubs Committee, for which the Club Officers wish to express their gratitude. BADMINTON CLUB The Badminton Club has had a most successful season this year, both as a team and Individually. After years of struggle we have achieved the highest honour by winning the Lar combe Cup of the University of London Men's League, and have again retained our position of runners up in the mixed league. Also, the men' steam has won all their first team matches this season, winning7 In the League, beating L.S.E.63 In the Final, and the University games, Reading111, Birmingham123 and Oxford University Woodpeckers90. Our' A' team twice lost narrowly to Cambridge University Cockerels. The club has once again played I.C. In the limelight, and of the31 matches played23 were won and8 lost. F.S. Lau has place dI.C. In the forefront of University badminton by winning the Men's Singles, Men's doubles and Mixed doubles of the U. A.U. championships at Hull and also the U.L. U. championships. This Is the first time on record anI.C. player has done so well. He\nalso captained the U.L. Badminton Club. A. Finch has won the keenly contested men's singles of the South Shields and District Restricted Tournament. He has been elected captain of the U.L. Badminton Club for the season195253. HEAD OF THE RIVER Of the208 crews rowing in the Head, some\n1 9 0 to200 failed to take full advantage of the stream when taking the bend at Fulham Football Ground, with a loss to their crews of anything from one to fifteen seconds. Not all of the I.C. coxswains were exempt from this criticism, eventhough it may have been due to a decision made at Barnes, some fifteen minutes earlier. Nevertheless, all members of the1.0. Coxswains So oie ty, would dowell to remember Rule V of the Laws of Boat Racing, wh i oh begins thus.\" A boat's proper course is such course as will enable It to reach the winning post in the shortest possible time, That means learning the\" proper course\" and steering it, at each and every regatta this summer.. Of the Head itself there Is little to say. The l st. VIII had a good row and are now back in the First Division. With fewer or ews to overtake and negotiate, they would have been seconds faster. The2 nd. VIII, up to Hammersmith, showed promise of good performances on the shorter courses later this term. The\" old hands\" in the4 th. VIII and the fresher s in the5 th., both did very well, the latter going up59 places on last year. The other fresher boats had their first taste of what boat racing can be like, and should produce some good material for the upper boats In a year or so. Results I1.0.1 \u2014 1 9 th.

    "content": "SB LIX PHOENIX SPRING'52 The new editor of' Phoenix' is to he congratulated on producing a good first issue. If he can keep up the standard he has set he will earn the thanks of all fol lowers of that ephemeral bird. Despite the generally high level of the contributions and the diversity of subject there does appear, somehow, to be the same atmosphere penetrating every article. Perhaps this merely shows that the contributors are all from I.C. but it does\ncause a certain uniformity of mood.\nThe major work is, as we have learned to expect, from the pen of the doyen of\"f he s nix*' contributors, Selby Angus. 'The Atomio Blonde* is the latest instal ment in the Staggers Saga and is well up to standard. Sir. Angus shows the breadth of his culture by his choice of prefatory quotation. Also in the o ate gory of fiction( according to the o on tents page) is' Red Tape Revolution* which is an extended anecdote, perhaps a little too extended, 'Heat Wave', a five finger exercise well sustained up to the anticlimax of its ending and 'The Falling House that Never Falls'. This last story fails, I think, in that the two sections, the description of the abbey and the encounter with the two boys, are really quite distinct and the unity and lightness neo ess ary for a piece of this kind is lost. The humour section( the divisions seam arbitrary) contains two good articles and a feeble one, all on some\naspect of College life, real or imaginary. 'The Hinge\nof Fate* is an amusing account of the I.C. swing doors\nfrom which we have all suffered. It is this sort of lighthearted treatment of a facet of the I.C. scene\nw hio his eminently suitable for the magazine. 'Fundamen-tal Research' will appeal to all postgraduate students but should be kept away from all third year people - it may give them ideas! In contrast with these two articles which gain by their use of loo al colour' Mol eA.R.S. M.1 uses loo al colour to try to put over at rite little fable but is conspicuously unsuccessful. The four essays in o lude dare not the really indigestible stuff we usually get under this heading.' Fore' is a plea for his game by one of the foremost golfers in the College and 'Lament' is another shoot of that hardy\nannual \"What is a University E duo ation?\"' Mediaeval Alchemists' consists of two anecdotes about alchemy w hio his a subject worth a fuller and deeper treatment. Is there an amateur oho mist historian psy oho logi ot in the College? Perhaps Mr. Lusher himself. Tho pri noi pal essay is \u00bbH.G. Wells', written in rather turgi o al prose\nan is ayin tj nothing enlightening about the subject. The\nfifteen hundred words of the essay are obviously totally inadequate to di sous s the works of Wells, a fact which must have occurred to the author who thereupon proceeded\nto write an article describing his own ( rather confused)\nideals with but a bare mention of the supposed sub jeo ti In fact, only two of Wells' books are mentioned by name\nand none are discussed. May I suggest that the founder\nof' Phoenix* bo more respectfully treated in its pages?\nOf the remaining features requiring comment the verse is unmentionable - is it really necessary, Mr. Editor? The photographs are interesting( even though the aerial photograph is prewar) and Mr. Dadd's drawings entertaining. More of these small sketches would be welcome as they considerably improve the appearance of the page.\nPARTY POLITICS\" Should the Conservative Party follow a Socialist Policy and to what extent?\" The discussion commenced with an understanding being reached on what Socialism actually was. There appears, however, to be no very wide knowledge of what it is among conservatives and the main points that arose in the definition were: complete state ownership, equal chances for all men and a recognition of private property( forming a distinction, it appeared, from communism). The main subject of the title had now been logically reached, but unfortunately those present were not a fair sample of Tory feeling in the College, and all now agreed that the definition given above should gradually form part of Conservative policy( at a previous meeting, out of which this one arose, one member considered that there should be no Socialism in Conservatism). It was indicated in passing that the Conservative J tert y had always been introducing socialist reforms in the past( but far too slowly as the chairman pointed out) and that after the present metamorphosis of policy envisaged in the discussion, the party should seriously consider introducing Communism\nas defined by Karl Marx, with the modern theoretical amendments( insisted on by the Chairman). It was agreed in this connection that Russian Politics were not Communism. The passing reference cited above of course leads to the conclusion that the Conservative Party should carry Socialism to the extreme, but over a considerable period of time. It was argued that the country cannot take Socialism in large amounts, i/ if mm\nSOCIAL. FRIBA XT MAY 2 N D.I.C.

    "content": "FELIX\nAT W IP TO THE WIGHT T HIDE OF THE T HOLE* Before the war at Guilds( not Horphy Day) it was the custom of the academic staff and students of the electrical department to take a short holi day together. This was reintroduced this year at the beginning of the Easter vacation by along weekend spent at VENTNOR, I. O.W. The object was to further the bonds of goodwill and mutual respect already existing between members of3 E and the staff( you' re right1 have not yet graduated). At AIM BAY Mr. D.M. TOMBS entered the sea ( in bathing trunks) at 1 2 . 3 2 ; emerged 55 seconds later, and was very quiet for the rest of the day. JEFF\nGARROD was nearly engulfed by quicksand and had to remove his trousers to wash and dry them. Photographs\nof these two events will be sent in plain, sealed envelopes to applicants through the rack. Later that day a visit was paid to COWES to look\nover the Princess flying boat. An excellent tea was\nprovided at which more observant members of the staff may have taken the chance of pio king out the opportunists among the students present. These were easily distinguished by the fact that they only smiled twice at tea, once on arriving and once on leaving, and\ndeclined conversation entirely, preferring to eat\nsteadily in a corner and to fumble hopefully in their pockets for a paper bag. The visit was extremely successful; even our\nasker of cac k' and ed questions was restrained from\nenquiring the pur po so of the Princess. He did, howe ver, succeed in asking how long the wooden \"mock-up\"\nof it would take too ross the atlant io.A five hour discussion( lubricated) was held of the course of study for an engineering degree at\nGuilds. As a result of this it was unanimously\ndecided to strike the study of belts creeping round\npulleys from the curriculum. Later the same evening\nHOWARD STEELE demonstrated hypnotism as a result of which PETER CLEGHORN will henceforth definitely and\nabruptly refuse any cigarettes offered to him. He\nalso sang \" Night and Day\" which he has never been\nheard to do before and - we hope - will never be\nagain. Many interesting and unsuspected interests and\npeculiarities were noted amongst the staff. It was\nemerged, for example, during the course of the four days stay, that one was interested in trains and\nthat another was trying to grow a beard. Spare unlicensed hours were spent in two ways - walking clockwise round the Island and walking anticlockwise round the island. In conclusion it can be safely said that this Easter trip was a Very Good Thing extremely enjoyed\nby all and \u2014 we hope - firmly reestablished as a tradition. ROVER HIKE As a break from the traditional Easter camp at Silwood\nthe I.C. Rover Crew this year cycle hiked in France. A party of four, all that was left after the field trips and the like had taken their toll, left London on\nWednesday, 2nd April, for Newhaven and the night ferry to Dieppe. After breakfast on board the next morning and a rapid tour of Bight seeing the party went by train to Rouen\nwhere the e yo ling began, and the first of the peculiarities of the French diet encountered - how to carry a3 foot loaf in a rucksack. Mathematical genius prevailed, by breaking it in half. The first camp, at Rom illy, not far from Rouen, was\nnotable for the gales on both sides of the canvas. The\ninclement weather could be endured but not the snoring neo ess it at in gia change of accommodation.\nAfter a day's cy linga long the valley of the Seine\na16 th century farmhouse, complete with television, was\napproached - where a site was found - but beware of the poisonous snakes in the barn! These were not quite such\na menace as the philosophy of the French motorist, who considers all other road users partially deaf and totally blind, and requiring continuous blasting with his horn. Having successfully ridden the French cobblestones Lea Edwards handlebars came off in his hand and a puncture was en ff nm d near pols s y.At St. Germain the ooo king paraffin ran out. All banner of substitutes from kerosene\nto medicinal paraffin were offered, until the wife of the British Army whispered the magic word, \" Petrol e\".. The highlight of Paris is reported to have been a whirlwind in the\" Place de la Concorde\" to the di so as fort of\" wi y and delight of passersby. Bou o on villers was remarkable for an early morning\nvisit. As Buckroyd stuck his head out of the tent he\ngaped straight into the eyes of a bovine beastie love at\nfirst sight. And so with only a broken 3 speed cable the party returned to England after10 days of enjoyable cycling. Lunch Hour Concerts)1.30 in the gym.) SUNDAYS\nNorman Samways, the I.C. Union secretary, is at\npresent visiting the Technisohe Universitat, Charlottenburg( Berlin), in response to an invitation from their President, Reinhardt Abraham, to Derek Coomber.\nTHUNDER ROCK The Dramatic Society' s Easter Production was' Thunder Rock' by Robert Ard rey. It tells the story of a man who endeavours to escape from the unpleasantness of the world by isolating himself in a remote lighthouse. He builds an imaginary world people d by the Captain and passengers of a ship that had foundered there90 years earlier. Instead of providing him with the optimistic world he seeks, they eventually drive Mm back to face the difficulties of his own times. Charleston, the escapist light keeper, was magn if ici ent ly portrayed t>y John Harding. He\nsustained his part throughout the play, and generally carried the whole action on his shoulders. It is a pity that he did not receive adequate support from the producer or the rest of the cast. In general, the other parts were poorly characterised, and many fine acting opportunities were lost. The notable exception was John Saunders., who was outstanding in the very difficult part of Briggs. Though having a rather colourless part as Dr. Stefan Kurtz, Douglas Lamer made the most of his opportunities in Act IIIi that that act did not die completely is thanks mainly to him. The major criticism must be of the production, which, though superb in places, was in general of a very low standard. The impression was that too little care had been taken during rehearsal. The accents which were tolerated ranged from a very phony American at times uttered unintelligibly through a cigarette, to an excellent London accent, the like of which Birmingham has never produced!! Charleston was well advised in using his natural voice the rest of the cast would have been under less of a handicap if they had followed his example. The first act opened slowly, and what life it developed was killed by an overlong' dramatic' pause at the end. AdamS obey, the Producer, should realise that these pauses, though effective in debate, can prove disastrous on the stage. On each occasion when he introduced one the audience's interest was lost, and the action of the play broken. It was downright bad theatre. Act II was the highlight of the play. It had pace, and was skilfully built up to a gripping climax. The finish was magnificent. Unfortunately the author wrote a further Act: more unfortunately the cast played it almost. Act III was the lingering death that earlier we had learnt should be suffered by neither bottles nor men. After the departure of the wreck victims it was a matter of just waiting for the end. It is a pity that the play finished in this lame way. It had shown promise, and at times sparks of brilliance. I was left with the feeling that' There might have been an excellent play'.

A bois trou s\"K angela* set the pace for the evening.\" In Town Tonight\" was as funny as it was\ndoubtful. Interviewed by Mr,E. Simon were, a fashion expert( J. Board) whose information on a critical test for\" gay deceivers\" will be values by many, a male\" the c wet awy\" Lamia), a drug addict( Bryn nie Griffen) and a\"fl r of ess or\" from the R.C.6.( Doug La rner). Mr. Lamer in the opinion of many\ngave the best individual performance of the evening.\" Certificate X\", a delightfully witty song was\nconvincingly performed in the style of the Western Brothers by John Harding and Brian Pur slow. A professional conjuror gave an admirable show which unfortunately was marred by excessive length. During the interval, while glasses were being recharged with freebee r,an enthusiastic\" Dutch Auction\" was held, and raised a creditable net t profit of \u00a3 3 - 2 - l5d plus an Irish penny for the1952 Olympic Games Fund. Perhaps with a more generous time allowance even more profit might have been made. A great deal of the latter half of the evening's at age entertainment was masked by that from the auditorium; it speaks very highly of the artistry of the\" celebrated quartet that they converted a more than hostile audience into one tingling with rampant enthusiasm. Mess rs. Bock, Fur slow, Lem in, and Corrigan deserve full marks for consistently good entertainment. The President of Guilds, and atrio of Miners by special invitation gave Imperial Unity to the finale of community singing, but true R.C.S. independence reigned with a final rousing\" K angela\".

DEBATE \u2022 THERE ARE NO VALUES, ONLY PRICES\" After rather dubious definitions of' price' and' value', Ur. haskell embraced many facets of ethics, skipping lightly... through history from Socrates and Spinoza to J.S. Mill, eventually arriving at worms\nwith manifestations of nervous systems. For the opposition the impeccable Anthony de Re uck propounded.\" that axioms must have universal existence, even if complications arose through lack of fundamental concepts of mathematics. He then rushed through history to prove that moral values always existed e*en if technologically impracticable; and finally listed the catch is m pertaining to always primitive tribes. Mesmerized by the mystic passing s of his hands and pleasant tone of voice, we missed the cogency of Adam S obey's support for the motion. X his spell was hardly broken by the steady drone from Ted. Simon in reply. Mr. Nicholas in throwing the meeting open plunged deeply into the mire with an impartial resume of his own ideas of values. The point was\nrapidly made from the floor that vak ies could be real or relative, from which it transpire a that the debate was on real values and not on prices at all. Subsequent speakers evading reproach or repression by the chair proposed alternatives to both' values* and' prices'. The motion was defeated by a large majority.

OLYMPIC DANCE As many Union members will already know. the cost_s f sending competitors( ecu Great J Sr its into Helsinki for this year*)* ely apia d has M found\nprohibitive for most of the amateur organisations.. Accordingly, the British Olympics Committee launched an appeal for donations to assist with the great expense involved. Following a suggestion by the Union Entertainments Committee, the Union have decided to run one\nof the usual Saturday night hops in slightly different form as a means of raising a target sun of \u00a350\nfor the Olympics Fund. This \u2022Olympics Hop' will be\non Saturday Hay 3 rd. Some of the Union's Athletic Clubs have already indicated thier willingness to assist the Entertainments Committee - it is hoped that other may do so\nwhen they reed this reminder. It is, however, for the main body of the Union to ensure that the tar get is reached - please support this venture if you possibly can, even though perhaps your time is becoming rapidly more and mora precious. The dance is from 8.00 - 11.30 p.m., and will include cabaret, side shows, prix es, etc. The Refi set cry will also have a buffet running as was tried ones last term. Tickets are on sale a tl/9d. plus tax, which means that all t ioke ts are about 2/~ .\nFull details are available in the Union entrance hall. f fiU BBB TBS DATE - SATURDAY MAY 3 rd.

    "content": "FELIX3 FrI THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAl COLLEGE EDITOR: K.P. EXDHIDGE\nWith the Easter vacation now a pleasant memo ry of days spent idling in the sun, on the broads, the south of France or Clapham Common; the echo of the plaintive cry of a Rug ger giant seeking his long lost coursework ringing through the quad is a harsh reminder of dread deeds yet to be done, and an indication of the retiring habits of students in the summer. But before you disappear to prove once again that a whole years' work can be done in three weeks,! give thought to the Union officers of next year beau roc racy, dictatorship( enlightened or dogmatic) or a well balanced committee combining the exuberance of youth with wisdom born of experience in tight places, will shield the body of this Union from the hard knocks of the real world beyond. The Union Committee is a reflection of the College spirit, so perhaps the extract from the\" Daily Telegraph\" of20 th March,1952 would give a little stimulus for even the Pyr ene boys. OXFORD GOES DULL UNDERGRADUATES of today seem to behave almost alarmingly well. They work harder, rag less, and, as a senior member of the university was yesterday forced to admit,\" Oxford does seem quieter than it used to be.\" To dons, of course, this new docility is all to the good. Such lovers of the contemplative life are hardly likely to regret the days when invisible strings crossed. every staircase, when every half open door precariously supported a bag of flour, when dreaming, spires sometimes culminated1 un gothic ally, and' when every dark quadrangle re echoed to the d in of song, dispute and breaking glass. And yet one cannot help feeling a little uneasy. Is there not in every man a rebellious spirit of mischief which, if it does not find innocent outlet in youth, must turn at last to bitterness or madness? The greatest fools, it is said, are often those who were wise too young. And, again, what makes our undergraduates so quiet and docile? If as some suspect it is fear for the future, fear of going down without the proper qualifications, then it is not only tomfoolery which is at a discount, but disinterested' scholarship too, and all that in the past has made\nour universities great. The set books are all very well; but not all the wisdom of the ages is to be found between their covers. Felix congratulates. JENNIFER OV/EN of Guilds i registry on her marriage\nto MIKE ADAMS an ex Guilds man.\nCYRIL MAPLETHORP ( 3 rd year Civil) on his marriage\nto FRANCES EVANS.\nMARGARET EVENETTT on her engagement to PETJOt BAYNTON.\nDAVID DEAN ( Capt. of Guilds Tennis) on his engagement to JOAN FURLONG.\nJOHN HOLMES ( Secretary of I.C. Entertainments) on\nhis engagement to DIANA HASLETT.\nDAVID BALL ( 3 rd year Electrical) on his engagement\nto BARBARA GILLMAN.\nREFECTORY SNIPPETS\nThe Union refectory will close on or about July27 th. and reopen on 1 st. September, by when it is hoped that the five year ' do' of t pe boilers will be over. A new hot plate may soon be installed in the Upper\nDining Hall, and possibly also a new coffee machine downs t airs. REFECTORY REPORT Improvements at last The Refectory Committee has just completed its report to the Governing Body on the first years operation of the Union Refectory by Mess rs. John Gardner. The committee reports a reduction in the catering loss, for the corresponding periods of August to March for last year and this, from\n\u00a33,600 to \u00a31,300- this after the \u00a31,000 management fee is allowed for. The improvement has been made roughly equally between food costs, wages, and in receipts. The committee\nsays that the\" increase in receipts has been achieved without the substantial rises in prices which have been tried in vain in previous years\", and gives full credit to Mess rs. Gardner s for this. The report then deals with the work taken on by their' Catering Sub-Committee' (see below) : a considerable investigation has been made into the costing and pricing of' function' catering, following complaints early in the year; and\nmore recently the Sub-Committee has inherited a situation where \" the brunt of the day-to-day work of supervision, of suggesting economies and improvements etc.\" fell upon them\nfor a considerable period. The report considers that John\nGardners should be able to take up this work and maintain close supervision of the working of the refectory services.\" Certain minor flaws\" have appeared during this work! such as when \" instances came to notice of apparent discrimination in serving the choicer and scarcer foods ( e.g. chops\nat lunches and suppers, available only at Staff Tables and\nfor members of the Sub-Committee).\"\n(The I.C. Refectory C tte. comprises! Sir Arthur Hall( of the Governing Body)(Chairman); Mr. John Levy (Vice'1\nChairman) Col. Lowry (Hon. Secretary), The Rector, Professor Pip p ard( Chairman, Staff Common Room); Mr. D.H. de G.Allen( Dean of Residents); Dr. Gilbert Wilson; The President of I.C. Union! The Presidents of Guilds, R.C.S., Mines and I. C.W. A.) TAKING STEPS It has been officially denied that the reason\nfor the renewal of the steps leading to the. Union cloakroom is the large number of thefts from the rs which have occurred. As recent users will have noted, a counter has been installed and it is hoped shortly to have cloakroom attendants present for the majority of the time the Union is open. FELIX understands that the reason for the back door to the Union being kept closed is the fact that it is believed to have\nI been used in the course of some of the thefts. A number nave also been reported from the changing rooms behind the stags, and regarding these, Mr. Samways, the Union Secretary, said that he did not\nthink that it was widely enough known that keys to look ers in the changing rooms were available, on\nloan, to Union members at the messengers'ledge\nby the Registry NEWS FIASHES\nThe British Student Tuberculosis Foundation is to open an\nexperimental rehabilitation centre of eighteen beds this summer . The 1951 Appeal Fund now stands at \u00a317,000.\nThe Editor and Sub Editor of the Guilds Engineer' represented the C*G. Engineering Society at the annual ball of the Ecole des Ponts et Chausses, in Paris. Dai Nicholas states that he is definitely not a candidate for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Presidency. Nevertheless he made a great public gesture towards pop-u lari ty in any primaries likely to be held here in calling for assistance in the demolition of set teas ordered last Saturday by the Judo Club and unclaimed.
