They will have a wider range of opportunities. They will also face\nproblems calling for new solutions. Today's children need the most imaginative and creative\nteaching. Teaching by men and women who are\namong the ablest of their generation... graduates\nwho are among the most outstanding of their\nyear. Teachers have greater influence on future\ngenerations than any other profession.\nWhat does Teaching offer you in return ?\nNew opportunities\nTeaching is a vigorous and growing profession. It offers\nthe graduate greater opportunities than ever before,\nboth in developing professional skills and in achieving\nposts of influence and responsibility \u2014 often far earlier\nthan in many other careers. For example, nearly half of\nthe men graduate teachers between 2\n5 and 2\n9 hold such\nposts and receive salaries well above the basic scale.\nAbout half of those in their 30's are heads of depart-ment s, earning up to \u00a32,330, or hold even higher posts.\nOne fifth of those now in their 4o's are headmasters who\nmay earn salaries up to \u00a33,850. The prospects are even\nbetter for graduates with first or second class honours, or\na higher degree.\nNew ideas - new initiative\nThe mastery of teaching skills and the evolution of new\nmethods are a stimulating challenge. New discoveries\nand new knowledge present teachers with problems for\nwhich there are no precedents. New communication\ntechniques and aids must be developed.\nTraining: an extension of your knowledge\nSome graduates feel uncertain whether they are\ntemperamentally suited to teaching. The one-year\npost-graduate training course equips you to start your\ncareer confidently on a basis of practical experience\nas well as theory.\nWhy not find out more?\nTalk things over with your Appointments Board, and\nask for the new booklet, 'Careers in Education for\nGraduates', or write for a copy to Room 114 (22C/1) Department of Education and Science, Curzon Street,\nLondon, W.1. It describes the schools of today and the\nkind of teachers they need; their salaries and special\nallowances.\n4\n\"\n\" J MM I He needs trained minds like yours\nto fit him for tomorrow's world\nIT'S Issued by the Department of Education and Science Soccer Cup\nI.C.3U. C.2 ON SATURDAY, December\n4th, U.C. visited Harlington\nto play I.C. in the first round of\nthe U.L. Cup. Conditions could\nnot have been called ideal, a heavy drizzle making the playing\nsurface treacherous.\nStraight from the kick-off I.C. put\ngreat pressure on the U.C. goal and\nwere unlucky not to take an early\nlead. Gradually after this bright start\nUJC. came more into the game and\nI.C. seemed to coast along.\nI.C. were always the more dangerous\nside and it came as no surprise when\nthey took the lead. Wellfair, beating\nhis man on the outside, centred for\nHopwood to dive and head past the\nU.C. goalkeeper.\nHalf-time Goal\nThe game was very even after this\ngoal and the conditions were becoming increasingly important to the pattern of the play; the greasy surface\nmaking recovery in the tackle difficult\nfor both defences. Just on the halftime whistle the home team was\nstunned when U.C. managed to score\nthe equal is er;a dangerous diagonal\nlob into the I.C. goal mouth was allowed to trickle into the net via the\ncentre forward's back.\nIX*.. Go Ahead\nAfter the interval, Hunt, playing a real Captain's game, strove manfully\nin the midfield. The team responding magnificently to his example,\nfought for every loose ball and tackled\nlike terriers. In the 51st minute an\ninspired piece of football culminated\nin Widelski pushing the ball through\nto an unmarked Hopwood who shot\npast the advancing goalkeeper into the\nnet. To their credit U.C. hit back\nimmediately when the left-half was\nallowed to run through and shoot past\na stat led Wojtowicz.\nGODDIN CUP\nOn Dec. 4th, I.C.

    "content": "2 FELIX MAIR ACCUSES\nLirmsey Filibustering?\nQ N THURSDAY WEEK, a large audience packed the Union Concert Hall, and witnessed the rare feat of a Union meeting open\non time!\nAfter the usual business of the meeting, Keith Cavanagh proposed the first\nof the two expected motions\u2014\"decrying the proposed system of loans to students.\nThe main point of this speech was that the present Government has changed\ntheir policy on student loans, and the means test.\nBecause of this change, the number\nof women students and those from\npoor families would fall, thus it\nseemed that the Government was\nignoring the Robbins and Anderson\nreports.\nThe first speech from the floor\nproduced the start of a series of boring amendments and counter-amend-ment s. Frank Fuchs, seconded by\nDavid Reich, proposed that a committee be set up to help the Executive\nlook into the position of student\ngrants. Reich added a touch of farce\nby suggesting that the meeting should\nsupport the amendment and reject the\nmotion. The President ruled him out\nof order. The amendment was passed\nvirtually nem con. ,\nTed Needham took the floor, and\nproposed that any mention of the\nmeans test should be deleted from\nthe motion. The President ruled\nBarry Mair out of order when he\nstated, \" I retract my statement that\nMr. Needham is a nit.\"\nA procedural motion was put for-ward, but Dave Livesey promised he\nhad further information to sway the\nmeeting. This led Mair to accuse\nLivesey of filibustering so that he\nwould not have to propose the second\nmotion on an open vote for the Presidency. The procedural motion was\ndefeated. Livesey told of the relatively high failure rates in countries\nalready having loans systems.\nTime running short, a vote was\ntaken after a procedural motion and\nthe motion was carried. A committee was set up consisting of Council\nplus Fuchs, Cavanagh, and Sean\nDunne.\nPROF. BLACK ET ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY\nOxford fails the Nation\nQ N30 NOVEMBER, P.M.S. Blackett, Nobel Prize Winner, Professor oi Physics at I.C.. ex-Dean of R.C.S., ex-Pro-Rector of\nI.C., was made President of the Royal Society. He refuses to state\nhis in tensions for the Society yet, but his views on the Society's recent\ncourse are clear.\nHe endorses enthusiastically the in.\nn ovations made by Lord Florey; including the increased numbers of\n\" technological \" Fellows, the expert\nstudies on the brain-drain and population growths and the advice it gave\nto the Trend Committee on Scientific\npolicy.\nThere is hope that increased attention will be paid to such reports in\nthe future, thanks to the position\nBlackett enjoys in the Government.\nHe is a member of the Council for\nScientific Policy under the Secretary of\nState for Education and Science, Mr. Crosland, who is responsible for \u00a3100\nmillion channelled annually through\nthe University Grants Council and\nResearch Councils.\nRecently, Blackett says, the numbers\nof staff and research students in British Universities have been rising by\n7 per cent, per annum. The cost of\nequipping university research has risen\nResearch\nPHYSICISTS\nMETALLURGISTS MATHEMATICIANS CHEMISTS ENGINEERS\nWith the demand for electricity doubling every eight years, we can offer\nsome of the most challenging research, both fundamental and applied, to be\ntackled in the coming years. Rewarding careers are also offered within the\nComputing Branch, where the solution of research, planning and operational\nproblems necessitate the use of some of the most advanced computer\nequipment in the world.\nYou will find a university-like atmosphere, modern equipment and\nopportunities for consultation with universities and research organizations.\nOur laboratories are pleasantly situated and have well-established sports\nand social clubs.\nExcellent salaries and prospects are offered; at 21 -22 with a good\nhonours degree you could earn \u00a31,100 p.a.; for a Ph.D. at 24-25 this might\nbe \u00a31,500 p.a. Freedom is given to publish the results of research and it is\npossible to work for higher degrees.\nApart from research, there are opportunities for electrical and mechanical\nengineers and physicists to gain two years engineering training leading to\ngood careers in generation, transmission or design and construction. Posts\nand training schemes in administration and personnel management are\navailable for arts graduates and those of other disciplines.\nW.H. F.

Further\ndetails obtainable from your Appointments Officer.\nby 15 pei cent, per annum. The\ndifference between these two numbers\nhe calls increasing \" sophistication\nfactor.\" If Britain is to get the most\nfrom her slender means, she must be\nruthless in her treatment of industry\nand university research alike.\nThe U.G.C. and the Research councils must provide clear-cut guidance,\nby making sure that new departments\nin Universities do not duplicate the\nwork of existing ones, and by developing \" centres of excellence \" \u2014 a few\nstrong rather than many weak depart-ment s.\" We must endow ability not\nsub sid is e mediocrity.\" he says. This\nnew world of science and industry\nwill be \"vital but not cosy.\"\nThe new scientific statesmen must\nrealise that the endowment o? scientific research depends directly on the\nproductivity in the near future of\nabout 1000 export firms, of most of\nwhich they have never heard.\nBoth the private firms and the universities (especially Oxford) have been\nguilty\u2014the one by failing to realise\nthe im pro. Vance of technology, the\nother by not encouraging science\nstudents into technology. More must\nbe persuaded, even though this will\nmean drawing- talent aw n\" from the\nscience departments. Further, the\ninhibitions in the way of business\nconsultancy by academics must di sap pear.\nCHRIS COOPER FOREIGN\nAFFAIRS\nSelected by Paul Smith\nThe Duke Wins\nThe Duke of Beaufort has been elected Chancellor of Bristol University\ndespite the passing, almost unani-mou sly, of a motion by the Union\ncalling on the student representatives\non the University Governing Body to\nvote against him. The proposer of\nthe motion said that the University\nhad chosen the Duke purely because\nof his social status.\n* * *\nClosing Time Put Back\nVisiting hours at two Bristol Halls\nof Residence have been extended, and\nresidents may now entertain women\nuntil 10.00 p.m., bringing them into\nline with the two new halls.

This was\na real relief all round, as several\nmembers of the crew were still feeling\nthe after effects of the .R.C.S. Carnival. The final took place four hours\nlater, by which time they had ca ugh* up, to some extent, on their lost sleep\nThis was well fought, but in the later\nstages I.C. drew well away td win\nconvincingly by two lengths from\nRoyal Veterinary College.\nThere was never any doubt that our\nfirst eight would win the Open even'\nand in the final they rowed home\nconvincing winners over the U.C team.\nd is organisation The Regatta as a whole was run\nwith the disjointed organisation that\ncharacterises University events these\ndays.

With the increased strength of the I.C. team mis year, hopes\nran high that we might reduce the usual crushing defeat to a more honourable,\none.\nRanelagh is one of the more lively\nclubs, with the proceedings starting\nand finishing at a pub down by the\nThame9 at Richmond. Their team\nnow includes an ex-Oxford Captain,\nan Olympic medalist and EC' s vice-captain who on this occasion stayed\nloyal to the college.\nCounting twelve in the match\nproved to be a wise decision. I.C. ran\nwell above form and only lost by the\nnarrow margin of 145-157. The\nbitter rivalry between Captain Howard\nDickson and Vice-Captain Alan Cope\nwas, on this occasion, resolved in the\nCaptain's favour; the course, punctuated with ponies, deer and Ranelagh\nveterans, being more to his liking.\nHappy New Year\nMany intrepid and fearless members of the club are spending NewYear's Eve running to Mountain Ash\nin Wales carrying a message of good\nwill (presumably) from the Minister\nof Sport to the runner in the Dec.\n31st Nos Galan meeting at Mountain\nAsh.

    "content": "FELIX5 I VIEWS EXPRESSED in these!\ncolumns are not necessarily those of]\nthe Editorial Board.\nGrants and the\nUnion Meeting\nJ\\T THE LAST Union meeting\nKeith Cavanagh ruined his\nmotion about loans to students\nby adding a demand for the abolition of the means test.\nWhat justification is there for saying that all students need equal\ngrants? I cannot believe that even\nKeith Cavanagh would seriously suggest that a student whose circumstances are now such that he receives\nthe minimum award of \u00a350 should\nautomatically receive the full grant.\nThe result of such action could\nonly be one of two things. Either\ntaxation would be increased, or the\nvalue of the grant would be cut so\nthat the total expenditure on grants\nremained constant. Both eventualities would lead to hardship\u2014 particularly in the lower income groups.\nThe abolition of the means test\nwould be in complete contradiction to\nthe original ideas of the Beveridge Report, upon which our social services\nare based, that aid should be given to\nthose members of the community who\nare in need.\nA person's ability to pay taxes is\ndetermined by a\" means test.\" It is\nthus only fair that his right to receive\naid should be determined in a similar\nway. Surely a grant should be regarded as a privilege and not as a right?\nKeith Cavanagh demands the abolition of the means test so that a student no longer shall depend on his\nparents. Does he see nothing wrong\nin depending on the parents of other\nstudents, the taxpayers?\nDAVID K. REICH\\ I/ ITH REGARD to the last Union\n\" meeting I was appalled by the\nunusual number of points of information offered by certain members of\nthe Union to nearly every speaker\nfrom the floor. This showed a lack\nof knowledge about the working of\nthe grant system in particular and\nthe general educational system in this\ncountry in general on the part of the\nspeakers some of whose speeches\nwere absurd and irrelevant and\nseemed to be designed merely to project images for electoral purposes.\nThis is of couse deplorable and much\nvaluable time was wasted on amendments and points of information\nwhen real business should have been\ngot through. It is important that all\nspeakers from the floor should fully\ninform themselves on the issues to be\nraised before coming to the Union\nmeeting and should confine themselves to the points relevant to the\nissue and should be ai brief as pos-sib le. Rhetoric is deplorable. I should hate an l.C. union meeting degenerating into a typical NUS conference involved in matter of procedures, amendments and the like.\nGEORGE BARAMKI,\nPhysics 2.\nI.C. Missed Out Again\n|>/V DECEMBER 1963, I.C. were invited to send two representatives\nto a\" European Week \" organised by The Ecole Centrale of Paris.\nBirmingham University and Cambridge were also asked ot send two\ndelegates each. Jenny Chapman and I represented I.C The meeting\nwas in fact a seminar on advanced\ntechnical education in Europe.\nThe countries represented were\nthe Common Market countries\nplus England and Switzerland.\nFares to and from Paris were met\nby the Union, and food and accommodation were provided by\nthe host University.\nRealising that we were extremely\nfortunate to be getting the benefit of\nthis experience, Miss Chapman and I did all that we could to pass the\nbenefit on to other members of the\nCollege. To this end we prepared a lengthy report for the Rector, copies\nof which were given to Dave Watson,\nthe then President of the Union, and\nkept in the Union files. In this report\nwe stressed that both Birmingham\nand Cambridge were intending to organise return meetings, and that I.C. being the foremost technical University in the country, should take the\ninitiative and organise a seminar the\nfollowing year.\nReports containing recommendations to this effect were published in\nFELIX and the 'Guild's Year Book,\n\" Spanner.\" I would like to quote\nfrom it:\n\" Birmingham and Cambridge are\nplanning a return meeting in England,\nso we should move quickly, or one of\nthe smaller colleges will steal the Initiative from us.\"\nThis is exactly what has happened.\nAs was reported in the last issue of\nFELIX, Manchester University is\nbeing host to the meeting, has obtained a Government grant towards\nthe cost, and has invited two delegates\nfrom l.C. Jenny Chapman and I left the College at the end of 1964, and were\ntherefore unable to organise such a meeting ourselves. The report rotted\nin the Rector's Office and in the\nUnion records, and l.C. missed out\nagain.\nIf l.C. continues in this ostrich-like\nmanner, we shall soon be the second\nor third Technical University in the\ncountry.\nR.F.

Jeans\nare better,\nMr. Doe!\nW// TH reference to Mr. Doe's article\nin the late news of the last issue,\nwhile agreeing with him about dirty\nshoes and jackets, I must point out\nthat there are several advantages in\nthe wearing of jeans.\n(a) If a motor cycle is the main\nform of transport, one doesn't need\nto worry about ruining a good pair\nof trousers.\n(b) Since jeans can be washed at\nregular intervals with very little effort,\none doesn't have to worry about getting i, zoa dirty situation (e.g. on the\nfloor).\n(c) Damage.

It is after all more fun to be aPr of fess or. This was one of the ideas thrown out by Prof fess or Denis Gabor, FRS,\nat the last and one of the most successful meetings of the Huxley Society\nthis term. The professor, a Hungarian expatriate who came to this country\nbefore the war, was speaking on the theme of the threat of le sure in an\nautomated future. The social organism has already performed a Parkansonian miracle in keeping the employment rate far below its between-the-wars level, despite\nthe increasing use of mechanical methods for performing routine and repetitive jobs. As the percentage of the work-force on the production lines decreases, the percentage of -blue-collar'workers increases, and the\ncollective waste, in the form of industries like advertising, trading stamps, and ever more compulsive consumption, multiplies. This process\nmust end soon, and society will discover that it just doesn't need the\nlabours of all but the most gifted part of its population. Professor Gabor has great faith in the ability of human beings to\nmeet this challenge. Who knows how much creativity lies in each of us?\nDo it yourself, artistic hobbies of all a or ts, vastly increased education\n( in which he sees little place for the teaching machine), perhaps even\na return of the primitive' manu fact ury', in which luxury objects are made,\nwithout division of labour, by people working for the love of it.

WILLIAMS\nLAM LEY'S TECHNICAL& GENERAL BOOKS ART MATERIALS DRAWING INSTRUMENTS STATIONERY PAPERBACKS1,3&5 EXHIBITION ROAD, LONDON, S.W.7 Breach of\nRule IS ii\nTAST WEEK residents of Blight\nHall were paralysed to receive a circular at first sight serving Notice\non Residents. However, the Notice\nwas merely a notice, excerpts from\nwhich follow :\n. . . The Security Police have reported that about 3 p.m. on Saturday\n4th December, about 550 young men\nleft the building accompanied by\nabout half a dozen tired-looking\nyoung ladies. These ladies had not\nbeen observed to enter the premises\nsince the Security Police went on\nduty at 8.30 that morning. It is\nquite clear that such behaviour is a breach either of Regulation 221\n, or\nRegulation 25 ii2 as well as a grave\nbreach of the spirit of para 173\nand\na misinterpretation of para 5 f4. In\nthis context I, the Disciplinary SubCommittee, am not prepared to engage in discussion about the precise\nCOL CUT TJ T IS NOT very often in this college than anything happens which really\noffends the ordinary student or viO;at es his cou eo i behaviour. However,\nthere are two subjects in the air at the moment which cannot, and should\nnot, pass without comment.\nWhere hove ait the\nSpotlamps gone?\nC;OU TH SIDECAR PARK and motor cycle shed have over the years seen\na good deal of the coming and going of a motley selection of vehicles,\nbut just recently, there has been a good deal more going than coming.\nAs long ago as the beginning of last session, people were complaining of\npilfering from bicycles and motor cycles. Reports in\" Peli x\" and\nnotices requesting items to be returned \" with no questions asked \" seem\nto have had no effect whatsoever. The problem has now reached a peak\nwhere a positive effort must be made to curb this activity.\nStudents are losing whole assemblies, wheels, engines and the like from\ntheir machines, the thieves now not content with bicycle pumps and spot-lights. Only a day or two ago, I spoke to a resident of Southside whose\nbicycle had been reduced to a frame overnight. The difficulty of finding\nthe offenders is high ten ed by the fact that people are always in the shed\ntaking their own property apart and a stranger in there would not be at\nall obvious. It seems doubtful that this is the work of students, because\nthey cannot use what they steal or it would be noticed by the owners.\nThey could of course, sell it, but it seems more likely that gangs of\noutsiders are coming in at various times, perhaps during the morning\nwhen it's quite quiet, and lifting our property in fantastic quantities.\nWhat can be done? Perhaps militant action by those affected to persuade the\ncollege to fit gates with locks could be the answer. Unfortunately the\nmotor cyclists do not have any official committee to represent them or\nact on thir behalf.\nHappy Days\nare here again\n\"DO STER S MAY ONLY be placed on Union notice boards if they have\n* the approval of the Publicity Officer. Generally such approval is granted\nwithout question, but recently, there has been a series of notices put up\nin Southside giving publicity to a group of people calling themselves \" the\nGay Set.\" The poster invites one to v.: it nearby pubs, and promise entertainment in the form of cabaret and lively company. You are promised\nthat no longer will your life be dull and uninteresting but will take on a splendid gay aspect. You will become one of the \" in-crowd,\" mingling in\nclose proximity with actors, pop stars and the like.\nYou get all these \" benefits \" and all you have to give is your presence.

Southside Car Parking Committee, apparently with power to\ntow vehicles away from the Southside car park had emerged, yet few\npeople had heard of its existence or how the election of the rulers of\nthis powerful group had been carried out.\nPete Hills, a civil engineering lecturer, Falmouth sub-warden and I.C.

He considers that Southside\nresidents have a tremendous Drivileee\ngiven to\nby Presifrom an interview\n\"FELIX\" last week\ndent Fletcher.\nIt seems that rising costs and falling\ntakings have lead to Mr. Mooney's coming to the conclusion that the only\nsolution is an increase in tariffs which\nmay be noticed next term. \" FELIX\" trusts that the Refectories Committee\nmeeting to consider prices will concern itself with reviewing the whole\ncatering field in the College, to consider if any other way of absorbing\nthe cost is practical (e.g. increasing the\nrate of turnover in the self service\nrefectories would help encourage students to eat there, spreading the costs\nover more meals).\nAn Indian Curry corner, a self-service cafeteria and a roped off section for the present waitress service\nare among considerations for a new-look ground floor refectory in South\nSide\u2014to relieve pressure on the other\noverworked facilities. High priority\nwill be given to continuing the self-service restaurant with its better meals\nat slightly higher prices.\nIt seems that all the College's eating\nproblems should be solved in five\nyears time when the new refectories\nopen in the central college block, j q Felix Colour?\nA COLOUR supplement for\nFELIX in Michaelmas 1966 ?\nA working party was set up to look\ninto the possibility of producing a joint colour supplement to student\nnewspapers mainly in the South East\nafter a conference of Editors here at\nImperial Colltge.\nThe Editors came to the conference,\nwhich was attended by observers from\nthe outside Press, at the invitation of\nFELIX,, and have appointed representatives of 1 N CANT( Canterbury),\nBEAVER( LSE), BEACON( North-amp ton),S LATE( Institute of Education) and FELIX to the working\nparty, IN CANT agreeing to handle\nthe initial correspondence involved.\nThe seventeen representatives present at the conference considered that\na circulation of 50,000 (giving a readership of upwards of 200,000) was\ndesirable to attract the money-earning\nadvertising, any more being too unwieldy in management.\nThe object of the supplement would\nbe to help the Newspapers earn\nrevenue to boost their (usually)\nminimal Union grants\nA divergence of opinion over the advisability of scaffolding in front\nof Southside led to this pile-up early Friday morning.\nEVANS LIES TO UNION\n\" JN POLITICS it is necessary\nto lie on occasions \" was the\nreply which L.S.E.

He decided to \" resuscitate a dormant com-mitte e.\" This was done by requesting two\nmembers of previous parking committees to represent their halls, and\nasking sub-wardens to nominate a man from their own hall in the two\nother halls. The committee, once\nformed, asked Mr. Stevenson to back\nthem with official support, and to\nauthorise them to remove vehicles\nfrom the Southside Car Park at their\ndiscretion.\nThe first action of the committee\nwas to demand of each resident that\nthey should register their vehicle, and\nobtain I.C. stickers for them. If this\nwas not done the committee might\nmistakenly remove their vehicle thinking it to be the property of a non-resident. If any resident considered\none of his colleagues to be making excessive noise with his vehicle, he\ncould complain to the committee. The\nmatter would then be referred to the\nHalls of Residence Committees.\nResidents using a car for a short\nperiod only, may register a car temporarily and thus prevent an embarrassing situation arising. Cars will\nonly be removed after extensive enquiries as to the owner of the vehicle\nhave been made.\nResults have already been achieved;\none old wreck has been removed and\nanother bought by a resident for\nrenovation.\nAfter talking to Mr. Hills and two\nhall reps, on this committee, it seemed\nobvious that their motives were hon-est. However, no Hall Committees\nhad been consulted and nor had the\nresidents of Southsidc. Co-operation\nis difficult to get from students at all\ntimes; but by acting in an unconventional and unconstitutional way, this\nCommittee hao set many students\nagainst it.\nMr. Hills apologised openly for the\nway affairs had been conducted. \" 1\nthought I was merely reviving an old\ncommittee, I never imagined such\ntrouble would follow.\" A lesson in\nPublic Relations can be learnt by all\nofficialdom.\nThe Southside Car Parking Committee has an onerous and unrewarding job. With co-operation from\nstudents, it will be able to regulate\nparking in the Southside Park with\ngreat success. I wish them well and\nwould like to thank Mr. Hills and the\nCommittee for what they are trying to\ndo.\nN.

    "content": "8 FELIX How an account\nwith the Westminster\ncan play an essential\npart in your career\nThings will be very different now you are out\non your own. Do you know what we mean ?\nQuite a shock Life in a bed-sitter can be unexpectedly expensive. Food,\nentertainment, sport, books, can all cost much more than you\nhad expected. For the first time in your life you really start\nworrying about money. Come and see the Westminster. We can help with expert advice.\nMaking things easier\nThe Westminster helps thousands of young people every\nyear. And goes on to help them, positively, throughout the,\nwhole course of their careers. Here is how the Westminster\ncan make things easier for you.\n1. As you get into your stride. You' ll soon have money\ndecisions to make (methods of saving, types of insurance,\nthe problem of a mortgage and so on). Your local\nWestminster Manager has immense experience of this kind\nof problem. If you want it, he'll help you draw up a personal\nbudget plan that will give you the chance to build up a small\nreserve of capital.\n2. Starting on your own. Perhaps at some stage you'll want\nto start your own business. Then your Westminster\nManager can help you in all kinds of unexpected ways. He can often put you in touch with people and opportunities\nthat can make the difference between failure and success.\n3. When your each the top. Sooner or later you'll have to\ninvest quite substantial sums of personal capital. The quality of your life after retirement depends on how you do\nit. It's not just a technical problem. The best advice comes\nfrom someone who knows the kind of man you are.\nHis instinct is not to warn, but to help. Is your image of\na Bank Manager SO years out of date ? Call in at your local\nWestminster Branch and see what an up-to-date bank can\ndo. You' ll probably find that the Manager will be prepared\nto lower; substantially, your bank charges in the early years\nof your career.\nServices that make life easier\nThe Westminster Bank offers many services to every\naccount holder - ranging from greetings cheques, savings\nand deposit accounts, travellers' cheques, foreign currency,\nnight-safes, safe-keeping of documents and valuables, to\nhelp with wills and investments. We want you to use them.\nAnd use them to the full. They are the key to an easier,\nwell-ordered life.\nNext time you pass the Westminster\u2014call in and ask to see\nthe Manager. He'll explain exactly how the Westminster\nBank can help you. Or write to the Westminster Bank\nLimited,115 Old Brompton Road, South Kensington, and\nask for our booklet' On Using Your Bank'. The Westminster\nhas over 1,350 branches in England and Wales.\nBANKING\nOPENING an account with a bank can have many advantages,\neven when the income is only a small one. Banks welcome the\nsmall accounts of students and people starting out on their careers\u2014\nafter all many of these are likely to grow into large ones later on.\nBanks have of course the basic functions that most people know about\n\u2014i.e. they accept deposits, provide a simple and cf ii c 'ent means of payment\nthrough the cheque system- and they lend, usually in the short-term, this latter\nfunction being one usually affecting indus ry and commerce rather more than\nthe private customer.\nThe cheque system is in fact what first attracts most individuals to banking.\nRelying on cash alone for making all one's payments is cumbersome and\nhighly inconvenient for anyone who has to make transactions involving more\nthan trivial amounts, as most of us have to from time to time.\nIncidentally over 537 million articles passed through the banks' clearings last year, worth \u00a3358,669 nr'lion,\n'or \u00a37,567 million per head of the\npopulation of England and Wales.\nHowever, the basic banking services\nare by no means all that the banks\ncan offer to their customers to help\nmake their financial lives run more\nsmoothly.\nSome of their additional services\ncould be useful to you now, others\nlater on. To mention one of the best\nknown, by making standing orders\nto your bank you can make sure that\nany regular payments you have to\nmake, such as subscriptions, insurance,\nrent, etc., are paid on the due date\nwithout your having to do anything\nmore than ensure that there are sufficient funds on your account to meet\nthem.\nFRIARS\nNOT ELEPHANTS\nTHERE ARE more elephants\nin England than there are\nfriars. Some of the few\u2014friars\nnot elephants\u2014were visited ou\nSaturday, December 4 th, by a group of predominantly first yea i students, accompanied by Brother\nColumba, SSF. The visit came\nat the end of the first week of i\" Getting to Know You \" scheme\nTravelling Friday evening, the\nweekend was spent at the Gonvent of\nthe Community of S. Francis at\nCompton Durville, Somerset, where\na group of nuns administer a hospital\nfor old people. The Friary visited\nwas near Cerne Abbas in Dorset\nOne of the Francisan friars told\nsomething of his work amongst drug\naddicts in the East end of London. At\nthe convent in the evening, another\nof the brothers told of his experiences\non the kibbutzim in Israel.\nLES JOHNSON Letter\nEdwards Cleared\nI WAS astounded by your coverage\nof last week's debate on Rhodesia.\nNaturally, one first notices the headlines of an article which in this case\nread \" Edwards loses control.\" I find\nit incredible to believe that your reporter thought that this sentence,\nwhich presumably is his opinion, was\nof such paramount importance to\njustify its use as a headline.\nIt is a pity that your \" reporter\"\ndid not hear the two main speeches.\nHad he done so, he would have noted\nthat they were not interrupted, contrary to What his article would have\none believe.\nI would add that in a debate on a topic such as the present Rhodesian\nsituation, it is to be expected that\nmembers of the audience participate\nby making spontaneous comment, relating their views to what is being\nsaid.\nCHRISTOPHER ERIKSON,\nTreasurer, Debates.\nED.\u2014The production of a headline\n\u2014selection of the most significant\npart of a story\u2014is an editorial fun c tion.\nAnother service which is much used\nis that of safe custody, whereby banks\nundertake the safe keeping of cus to mers' documents and valuables\u2014\nwhich might .include, for (example,\nNational Savings Certificates. Services connected with travel include the\nprovision of travellers' cheques (which\ncan be bought to use in this country\nas well as abroad, though they have\nof course chiefly become known in\nconnection with foreign travel), buying of foreign notes and coin, and obtaining passports.\nIf you want to save something, as\ndistinct from operating a current ac-count, on which of course no interest\nis paid, you may open a deposit or\nsavings account, on which interest will\nbe paid, related to the current level of\nBank rate, and changing as that\nchanges. You may also buy savings\ncertificates and Premium Bonds\nthrough your bank.\nAltogether one's bank account\nusually turns out to be an indispensable part of one's financial arrange-ment s. GOD AND MAN\nFew people really believe in God,\nif they did, they wouldn't continue to\nthink and act as they do ; this country\nis overrun with people who are theoretical believers but practical atheists.\nThis view was expressed by Jack\nGraham when he came to address\nI.C.C. U. on Monday 29th November.\nHe quoted Paul as saying that if\nonly man were to examine the world\naround him, he would see ample evidence to convince him of his mis-deeds. Man has a built-in conscience\n\u2014he knows when he has done wrong.\nMan cannot find God by searching\n\u2014 to start with, man is finite, whereas\nGod is infinite, and besides this,\nman's understanding is impaired by\nsin. Intellectualism isn't everything.\nThe man who starts by saying \" I don't know \" is more honest than the\none who says \" I know it all.\" '\nGod must reveal Himself to man\nif man is to know Him \u2014 in terms that\nman can understand. This is one reason for the coming of Christ\u2014God's ultimate word to us. Through Him we can come to know God. But we\nmust first be prepared to climb down\nand say: \" God, I don't know\u2014take\nme and show me.\" Q^WHAT LONDON OFFERS\nA STUDENT Editor: R. Dewan\nHave you explored Soho'! If you\nhaven't, you are recommended to\narm yourself with a copy of\nWhat London Offers a Student\nand go to Piccadilly on a Saturday evening\u2014Yes, you are assured of a wonderful time.\nThis publication, edited by R. Dewan, has some of the most interesting articles on student London. It is Free for the First\nYear students but others can obtain it for a paltry 3/-; it is a good value for money.\n\n"

The response\nof 2 NT denies holding either four\nhearts or four spades, whilst showing\na maximum no-trump opening. It is\ngenerally sound policy with a hand\nlike South's to bid merely 3NT, rather\nthan introduce a3D call, for 3NT is\nprobably going to be easier to make\nthan 5D, where one can afford to lose\nonly 2 tricks. It has the additional\nadvantage of giving no indication to\nthe opposition of what might be a good lead. However, in this case, 5 D is clearly a better contract. East took\nsome time deliberating over his initial\nlead, before eventually settling on the\nten of clubs.\nOn the lead, declare r has no difficulty in making eleven tricks, 3 in\nclubs, 3 in hearts, and 5 in diamonds.,\nand in practice, 12 tricks were made\nwhen E, having to find 5 discards on\nthe red suits, elected to part with\nthree spades and two clubs, so enabling the three of clubs to take the\n12th trick. Score : plus 690 NS.A spade lead would have set the contract by one trick, provided the suit\ndid not get blocked.\nAt the other table, where weak no-trumps were being played, the bidding\nsequence was totally dissimilar. (Re-member the I.C. pair here were sitting\nEW). NES W ID 2S4D4S No No5D No No 5S No No6D NoNo6 S Dble NoN oNo East's2 S bid is a weak Romanjump over call, indicating a2 suited\nhand, the bid suit and the next un-hid suit above it, in this case spades\nand clubs. The subsequent spade calls\ncf East and West were sacrifice bids.\nWhen North eventually was \"pushed\"\ninto 6D, and East did not double,\nWest reasoned that the defence was\nunlikely to take more than one\ntrick (in spades), and so he introduced\n6S bid, which was promptly doubled.\nIf East, instead of the club Queen,\nheld the club Jack, this manoeuvre\nwould have produced a brilliant re-sul t, for 6D would have then been\nmake able for a score of 1370, compared with just 500, EW only going\n3 down in their 6S contract. NS can\ndefeat 6S by more than 3 tricks if they\nstrike at the trump suit straightaway,\nso minim ising the am out of cross-ruffing. As it was, East managed to\ncross-ruff heart j and clubs, and ended\nup with 9 tricks. Score : plus 500. NS. Unfortunately, North has no means\nby which to avoid losing a club, as\nwell as a spade, so the 6S bid was a phantom sacrifice.\nBirds nest by Stephanie Vogler\nAmbitious Potato\nEnvelopes Tomatoe\nT F YOU LIKE your food hot, then it's time you\ntried Heinz curried beans.

If you are a mbit i ohs, use the onion, tomato and bacon part of last issue's recipe, and scoop out the inside, mix all together\nand return to the potato shell to re bake.
