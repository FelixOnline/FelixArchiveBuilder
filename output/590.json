If you want to join come along\nto Freshers' Fair and pick up a form from our\nstall. We will also give you a diary of the\nautumn term's events.\nOur first venture this year, took place in\nAugust when fourteen of us visited a Shell gas\nrig, thirty miles from the Norfolk coast. This\nwas enjoyed by all, even the legendary\nMichelin man and his mechanical marvel.\nThe first event this term will be a presentation by two people from the Industrial\nSociety headquarters, Julia Cleverdon and\nPeter Nessbitt, which will take place in Chem\nEng LT1 at 6:00pm on Tuesday, October 13. I hope to see you there!\nRed Cross\nThe imperial College Red Cross Society exists\nto train staff and students in the basics of First\nAid and Nursing and to uphold the traditions\nof the International Red Cross which is the\nlargest voluntary organisation in the world.\nThis term we will be arranging courses in First\nAid and Nursing which are open to all\nmembers of the College and will enable you to\ngain a good working knowledge of these skills.\nOur courses are informal and entertaining and\nlead to a standard government recognised\nFirst Aid or Nursing Certificate.\nHere at IC we have a large active uniformed\ndetachment of trained First Aid personnel who\nprovides First Aid and Nursing assistance\nthroughout the London area as required. We\nare fortunate in possessing a fully equipped\nFord Transit ambulance which is regularly\nused to transport elderly and disabled people\nall over the country and to stand by at sport\nevents, race meetings, etc, where First Aid\nmay be required. We work in close conjunction\nwith the College Health Centre and the vehicle\nis used to attend any accident or emergency\nwithin the College campus.

If so please\ndo come and see us at Freshers' Fair and to\nour introductory meeting on Thursday next,\nOctober 8, at 6:00pm in the Bot/Zoo Common\nRoom (which is on the left under the archway\nleading to the Union Building), where we will\nshow some films, tell you all about the Red\nCross and hopefully provide you with some\nlight refreshments.

This means that if\nyou want to see all three films you save \u00a31.10\nfor your \u00a31 membership, i.e. you get more than\nyour money back on this term alone.\nMembership also entitles you to cheap\ncopies of our fanzine, NME, free use of our\nextensive(ish) library, and a chance to play silly\ngames (eg SF Call My Bluff and Superhero's What's My Line). Also, join us at conventions,\nBSFA meetings, etc.\nSee you, Elsie, Sorter of Chaos.\nICCAG\nOne quality apparently important in an IC\nstudent is apathy. BUT changes are on their\nway. Through the Action Group you can\nfight back and do something constructive!\nAmongst activities last year were: blood\ndo ning; building adventure playgrounds; draught proofing old peoples houses; helping in\na play group; concerts in hospitals; and, IC's famous soup run! Don't miss the Freshers'\nSoup Run (This Tuesday night, meeting in\nFalmouth Kitchen at 10:30pm). Find out how\nmuch fun it is, driving round London in a cramped van (great way to get to meet some\nnew people) with soup slopping around your\nfeet, then finding that London's down and outs\nare not what you expected.\nIf you have any questions or ideas, come\nand have a chat at the ICCA G stall at\nFreshers' Fair and watch out in FELIX for\nfuture events.

If you can't make it to the\nFreshers' Fair, just turn up to any practice\nsession (Tuesday or Thursday, 6:30pm, Gym)\nor contact Martin Johnson, via Metallurgy\nletter-racks.\nGliding\nI CGC aims to cater for anyone who is\ninterested in gliding, whether they are\ncomplete novices (as most people are when\nthey start) or experienced cross-country pilots\n(which most keen beginners can attain after\nonly a couple of years flying), whether they\nmerely want to enjoy themselves or whether\nthey have their eyes set on the next world\nchampionships! For the first two weekends of\nterm (10-11 and 17-18 October) we have\narranged for two, dual-control gliders to be\nmade available at Lasham, for anyone who is\ninterested in finding out about gliding. To find\nout more about these weekends (eg, cost and\ntravel arrangements) and any other aspect of\ngliding come along to our first meeting of term\nof Thursday, October 8, at 5:30pm in Aero\n266, when an introductory film and talk will be\ngiven.

    "content": "W Letters Im to the\nEditor\nDear Sir\nThe article in FELIX dated August7 on the Imperial College financial grant from the U GCl or the period198184 rather understated the real\nnature of the cuts indicted on,\nus. It is true that othe r colleges\nand universities may fare worse\nthan us, notably the University Salford or Bradford but many have also done considerably better than Imperial College. We, in fact, sit in the middle of\nthe cuts league, which is rather mediocre considering the prestige that this college normally enjoys.\nThe UGC letter does not as\nstated single out Imperial College for special treatment but follows the normal practice of earmarking the grant sep arat ely from the rest of the\nuniversity. It is true that IC will get a little extra income lor furniture and equipment, but this is also earmarked and the bulk of the UGC grant is\nspent on salaries. The cut of15% or almost \u00a3 3 mover three\nyears will affect student/staff\nlevels and reduce levels of\nsupport to both teaching and research. At least one estimate\nputs this as a loss of300 staff\nfrom a total of a little over\n2,000.\nClearly in a major scientific:\nand technological centre like\nImperial this will not only mean a lower output but a reduction in standards, quite the reverse of the statement\nmade by Mark Carlisle, Secretary of State for Education, that places like Imperial would not be affected by government policy. If you, like us, care about\nthe future of Imperial College can I urge that FELIX use its\ncolumns to demand a change\nof course, this can be assisted\nby members of the College writing to their MP c/'o House of Commons, Westminster, London SW1 and contacting their student union and/ or trade union and asking them to join the light to defend the\ninterests of Imperial College and higher education in this\ncountry.) o in \u2022 sincerely\nJohn Fe camp Sec retail ICA SIMS Dear Sir\nFood is a subject dear to the\nhearts ( and stomachs) of most\nof us.

It appears that the Union Executive have marked this\nanniversary by having a partition built in the Union Lower Lounge( hereafter referred to as' McCabe s Folly'). This remark abl v grim edifice has been built to separate the games machines from the bar area. Similarly, the Berlin Wall was built to separate the East German workers from International Capitalism. Of course had the\nBerlin Wall cost as much per\nfoot to build as McCabe s Folly the measure ma v well have been vetoed by the East\nGerman Politburo. The Union Exec were not\nconstrained by similar 'pedants', such as UFC, thus\nthey were free to indulge their\nfancies ( would Louis XI Y's Versailles extravaganza have\ncost so much per loot?). One remembers thai Louis XVI was guillotined for less, how much cake could have been\ndistributed to the Parisian peasants lor \u00a31,500?\nThe new carpet that will have the honour to surround the ' Folly' will cost \u00a31,000. It\nshould be noted that one will be able to remove beer stains\nI ro km it and replace cigarette\nburns. Though not made of asbestos it has similar aesthetic\nqualities.\nAn alternative theory would be that, like the Kremlin Wall( where heroes\nof the Soviet Union are interred), noted Union Officers would be entombed upright in the superstructure. Having witnessed its growth from an unimpressive pile of timber to ' McCabe s Folly' I think I can make a few pert in ant observations.\nFirstly, were the Exec so\ndesperate to spend money that\nthey could waste almost a quarter of their allocation for\nUnion facilities on such an on event? Secondly, win was the\ndecision taken to go ahead so\nlate ( mid September) in the\nlong vacation? This meant that only one week was available for construe tion( one could validly describe it\nas a' rush job\"). Though not\naccusing the Exec of wilful extravagance Ido think that\nat least some members ol UFC, or House Committee, could have been contacted( Jen has their phone numbers) in view of the cost. I await with interest any diatribe from the Union Office on economic stringency, on\" living within our means' ,\n\" belt tightening\", etc.\n/ IIIII sir. your obedient servant,\nStephen Gould cr Small Ads\nSmall ads will be accepted at ANY time\nand will appear in the next available\nissue.

To a quaint themselves with the facts about the cuts in higher education.2. To write to their M.P.'s expressing concern about the governments policy on higher education using the standard letter( from\" Instructs2\") as a basis. GESTE T:;ER DEMONSTRATIONS. Anyone wishing to use the Geste t ner, which is a duplicating machine, should come and see me in the Union Office and I'll arrange a time for a group demonstration. MOTION ON THE UGM CHAIRMAN Proposed by: N. Morton. Seconded by: D. Thompson. ICU Notes:1. The great importance of the position of UGM Chairman. MOTION ON THE CUTS Proposed by: M. Taylor. Seconded by: N. Morton. ICU Notes:1. The Government's policy on Higher Education, which is resulting in an11L o15%f all in real terms in the amount of money available to the University Grants Committee( UGC) for distribution amongst universities over the next three years. This is partly due to a direct cut in grant and partly due to the removal of the subsidy on overseas student fees.2. The current holder of this esteemed position is a buffoon. ICU Instructs:1. The aforementioned buffoon to wear a silly red clown type nose at all remaining UG M's this session.2. The Executive to authorise money for the purchase of this nose. The way in which the UGC plans to divide these cuts amongst the universities and the ways it assumes that they will meet this fallin income, asset out in the UGC letter to universities of1 st July,1981. That the UGC proposals are for a fallin the total number of home and EEC university students from1979/ Pin the ratio o MOTION ON IRANIAN STUDENTS number of home and EEC university students from261,000 in1979/80to249,000 in1983/4, and ac in the ratio of Arts: Science: Medicine studen from50:41:9 to48:42:10. and a change ts4. That amongst the universities worst hit by the UGC proposals are Bradford, Salford and Aston, which all have a high proportion of science and technology students.5. That Imperial College is to face a drop in income from the UGC of about15% over the next three years, with an increase of170 in home and EEC students over the same period.IC U Believes:1. That the government's policy of higher education cuts is shortsighted and ill advised, particularly at a time when the number of18 year olds is increasing.2. That any cuts should be made with regard to the national interest of preserving a coherent university system with a high level of academic excellence. Whilst universities must retain their autonomy the present cuts call for a degree of central planning.3. That the demand from industry for more students of science and technology should be a priority in deciding the future of higher education. Whilst the increase in the proportion of science students is a step in the right direction it still leaves them in a minority and with their actual numbers reduced.4. That the cuts have been hastily executed and hence badly planned. The government does not appear to have fully appreciated the consequences of its crude cuts in grant, and has not indicated its intentions for the future of higher education. ICU Notes: Proposed by: O.S. C. Committee. On7 th September,1981,54 Iranian students staged a peaceful demonstration against the current wave of executions and other happenings in Iran under the present regime. They were arrested after occupying the Iranian Consulate in London. The protest lasted about ten minutes. Since then the men have been held in police custody and the women released on bail. ICU Believes: That it is the recent events in Iran i.e. the execution of hundreds including women and children for exercising their basic right of freedom of expression that had provoked these students into taking this course of action. ICU Instructs: The Executive to write to the Home Secretary and the Kensington Police pointing out:1. No extradition procedures be carried out.2. Bail be granted as soon as possible.3. The fact that these students are law abiding with no previous convictions.

For the practically minded,\nwe own three telescopes: a twelve inch\nCass e grain and six inch and eight inch Newtonian reflectors\u2014all of which are in need\nof some attention. We also have access to a half-built observatory at Silwood Park, near\nAscot, which, when completed will enable us\nto escape from the glare of London skies and\nuse the telescopes to their full capability. If all\ngoes well we also hope to help in the\nconstruction of a simple radio telescope within\nthe physics department, and thus extend the\nrange of our observing programme.\nAlthough last year our observing was limited\nby poor weather and lack of enthusiasm on the\npart of some members, we still managed a very full lecture programme, on topics such as\nthe Daedalus Project, Mars and The Voyager\nMissions given by such famous astronomers\nas Penny Wright, Dave Laughton, Patrick\nMoore and Dr Garry Hunt,' as well as\nmembers of our own physics department\ngiving talks on their own particular areas of\nresearch. We hope to continue this programme this year with lectures planned on\nsuch subjects as Specular Interferometry,\nInfra-Red Astronomy, X Ray Astronomy,\nCosmology and Neutrons. Given sufficient\ninterest there is the possibility of trips to the\nGreenwich Observatory, Jodrell Bank and\nother places of astronomical interest (though\nhopefully not cost!).\nWhatever you particular interest in\nastronomy, please come and see us, if not at\nthe Freshers' Fair, then at our first meeting in\nthe second week of term, where the telescopes\nwill be on display (and in use if the weather is\nkind!) and coffee and biscuits will be provided.\nAerosoc\nAlthough this society is primarily that of the\nAero Eng Dept, members from other departments are welcome. If anyone is\ninterested in the occassional visit or talk with\nan aeronautical bias come and manifest\nyourself in the Aero UG study room (Roderic\nHill 252) and ask for the society execs.\nIC Choir\nDo you want to make new friends and enjoy\na varied social life, from ice-skating to classical\nconcert trips? Would you like to spend a weekend on a country estate, or perhaps sing\nin the Royal Albert Hall before an appreciative\naudience? Most of all would you enjoy singing\nin a highly acclaimed choir consisting of over\n150 male and female voices?\nIf the answer to these questions is yes, then\nImperial College Choir is where you should\nlook. Our Christmas concert will be Mozarts\n' Mass in C Minor' and Geoffrey Bush' s 'Christmas Canata' with the Verdi Requiem\nand Bach's 'St John Passion' to look forward\nto in future months. The first rehearsal of the\nterm will take place on Thursday, October 8 in\nRoom 342, Mechanical Engineering at 5:45pm. Bring a friends and meet many more at\nImperial College Choir.\nCONSTITUENT COLLEGE UNIONS*\nCCU Freshers' UGMs kick off at 2:30pm.

The Reception U GM this afternoon will (God and\nDay Bookings willing) be held in Me ch Eng 220\nat 14:30 (half past two to you Mr Smith). This\nbit of FELIX will normally be written by our\nPublicity Officer who will hopefully do it better\nthan this.

There's a band called Really and disco, all';\nfor a quid. See you there-Ed.\nWell girls and boys, here we go with another\nexciting year here at R CSU, and what a fun\ntime we're going to have. To all our new\nvisitors, welcome to the big school, and I hope\nthat you will enjoy your stay here, however\nshort it might be.\nUncle David, Uncle Andy and I have been\nbusy organising lots of games for all you little\npeople who are lucky enough to want to be\nscientists when you grow up, so that you can\nhave lots of fun in the first week.\nTo start off with we are holding a jolly union\nmeeting in the Great Hall at 2:30pm( big hand\non the six, little hand on the two), when you\ncan all see us being enthusiastic, and then that\nevening we have organised a party with the\nrough children from the two reform schools,\nwhich could be lots of fun.\nOn Tuesday there is a special treat\norganised by Mr Nathan, Life Sciences Dep\nRep, called the Life Sci Party. Anybody can go,\nthough, provided they bring a bottle or a few\ncans. So get the cream soda out, and we'll all\nhave a spiff ing time.\nICYHA\nThe aim of ICY HA is to get you out into the\nbeautiful British countryside using youth hostels to stay at. Our first activities this term\nwill be a weekend in the Peak District on 16-18\nOctober, and a cycling trip to the Chilterns.\nDetails of the terms activities and the\nslideshow will be at the Freshers' Fair.\nDancing\nDon't be shy; be inquisitive, and come along to\nthe J CR in the Sherfield Building at about\n7:30pm on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.\n(Starting Monday, October 12.)\nThe club caters for beginners on Tuesday\nand Wednesday evenings during the first term.\nIf you feel you are more advanced, then come\nalong on Monday evenings to learn a few more\nintricate steps. We also offer opportunities for\nthe competition and medal dancer\u2014in fact, we\ncan boast a very high success rate in last\nterm's medal exams, and a very good performance in the Inter-Varsity Dancing Competition.\nAs well as lessons, we also organise social\nevents; the two highlights this term being the\nLondon Ball, which is an event for all\nstandards (Friday, December 11), and our own\nAnnual Dinner and Dance( Saturday, November 28).\nRemember, one day you may wish that you\ncould dance\u2014so why not come along and\nlearn? Or at least have a good time as you try\nto!\nFor further information, contact Maggie\nFeirn, Physics 3, via the Physics letter-racks.\nWednesday evening sees the pub crawl,\nstarting at Stans with drinks between 7:00 and\n7:30pm, but I'm afraid that really only the\nbigger children should be allowed to go.\nOn Thursday evening MOP SOC are holding\na Cheese and Wine Party, and no doubt will\nbe discussing mathematically how many\nglasses they have drunk, and afterwards\nfeeling physically sick. (Groan.)\nThe big event of the week is the nice game of\ntiddlywinks along Oxford Street on Saturday.\nWe all meet in the R CSU Office between 9:00\nand 9:30am and then off we go for a pleasant\nmorning winking. We play ring-a roses around\nEros at 12:30pm, and then dive into the\nCockney Pride before returning to the R CSU Office for drinks, courtesy of the Vice President.\nAnd to round the week off, on Sunday we\nwill be going out for the afternoon with the big\nred fire engine, possibly for a picnic (depending\non the weather) and then returning for the\nbar night with songs and other fun in the Union\nBar.\nThere will be lots of exciting things going on\narranged especially for you. So please take\nadvantage of them and don't forget to get your\ntickets for the fresher s dinners which are on\nsale now.\nChemistry, October 13\nPhysics, October 16\nMaths, October 20\nLife Sciences, October 23\nPhil\nPage 10 FELIX, Octobers, 1981\n\n"

If\nyou would like to join, whether to present programmes or help on the\ntechnical side 'behind the scenes', or if you are even slightly\ninterested in radio there is an introductory meeting arranged\nespecially for you this Wednesday evening (October 7) at 6:00pm in\nour studio in the basement of 10 Princes Gardens. At this meeting\nyou can find out about the many different aspects of involvement in\nIC Radio, hear about what goes into making a radio programme and\nask lots of awkward questions about how and why we do things. (Of\ncourse, you can also join IC Radio there.)\nWe broadcast on 301 metres (999kHz) medium wave to the halls of\nresidence around Princes Gardens; unfortunately our licence forbids\nus to be heard anywhere outside the College grounds, so we cannot\ntransmit to all IC students. If you don't live in one of the above-mentioned halls, you still have an opportunity to listen to your own\nradio station: we can be heard in the Junior Common Room on Tuesday and Thursday lunchtimes on the PA system there, and also\nby high-quality line to Southside Bar every night of the week during\nopening hours. Plans are in hand for an extension of our 'Lines'\nnetwork to the student houses at Evelyn Gardens, however, we have\nto rent a line to there from British Telecom (formerly the Post Office)\nand they have been very slow supplying it.\nThe news service of IC Radio provides the most up-to-date\nappraisal of events in and around College (apart from FELIX), as well\nas bringing you news from the rest of the country and around the\nworld. In addition to that, in our nightly programme 'Viewpoint' we\npresent features on particular events in College and interviews with\nthe people involved in them.\nIC Radio is the only station in London specifically playing music for\nstudents; all the presenters are students, but even if you don't like\nwhat they choose, you can phone in a request on Int 3440. Now you've read about it, why not listen?\nPS: Don't forget the meeting on Wednesday evening at 6:00pm, or\nyou can call into our main studio area beside the Southside Shop al\nany time.\nImperial College Ents present....\nWEAPH\nPADOVANIS\nGreat Hall\nWed October 14\n\u00a32.50 from\nENTS or Union Office\nH Opportunity\nKnocks!\nStudent Television Of Imperial College ( STOIC) was founded in 1970\nto provide publicity for IC Union events through the use of the\nCollege's newly opened TV studio in the Electrical Engineering\ndepartment.\nSTOIC is now in its twelfth year and has come a long way from its\nhumble beginnings in terms of programme style, content and\ntechnical quality. STOIC now has its own closed circuit network\nwhich enables residents of Beit, Linstead, Weeks and Southside to\nreceive STOIC alongside BBC and 1TV on their hall television sets.\nThe Junior Common Room and Southside TV Lounge complete the\ncampus coverage.\nWhilst still relying on the College's educational TV studio, STOIC now has its own, in the Union Building, designed and built by\nmembers to enable recording to take place outside College hours\nand at weekends.\nIn general, STOIC transmits a variety of 'non-topical' programmes\non Tuesday lunchtimes. These include documentaries, celebrity\ninterviews and a host of quiz shows. On Thursday at 1:00pm and\n6:00pm com.es ' News break', the weekly news and magazine programme for IC students. It covers topical events in and around\nCollege by means of studio interviews and location items recorded\nusing our portable video equipment. Included in the programme is\n'Film Review' where the latest releases are previewed with stills and\nclips.\nWhat do STOIC members do? Producing television programmes requires a team effort, the\nnumbers of which need to possess a combination of artistic and\ntechnical skills. STOIC members have the chance to try their hand at\nany of the jobs involved: directing, producing, reporting, camera work, sound engineering, videotape editing, script writing and\nthe vital technical maintain en ce of the studios and equipment. No previous experience is required as there are training sessions\narranged over the first weeks of term.\ny/ wh~ va\n'ue ca|,\ndIA STl\na student concession card\nSTUDENT 1\n2\n3\n4\nValid till the last day of October 1982.\nStrictly not transferable and subject\nto the conditions outlined overleaf.\nIr>IA STl\ni student concession card\nSTUDENT 1\n2\n3\n4\nValid till the last day of October 1982.\nStrictly not transferable and subject\nto the conditions outlined overleaf.\nHave you go to\nne yet?

We meet every\nWednesday for a talk, discussion or social;\nwith lunch always provided.

Other activities for this term include weekly\nprayer meetings/bible studies, trips to the\ncinema and theatre and a visit to London Zoo\n(to return our Chaplain). We also hope to\nleave bustling London for a weekend away so\nthat mind, body and spirit may be replenished.\nMethsoc will be represented at Freshers'\nFair in the guise of a human coffee machine.\nTake a break from aimlessly wandering around\nthe mass of stalls for a free cup of coffee and\nfind out what Methsoc is all about.\nOn Wednesday, October 7, we are having\nour first meeting of the year at which you will\nbe able to sample our unique lunch (free to all\nfirst timers) and get to know old and new\nmembers as well as Methsoc itself.\nAnti-Apartheid\nWelcome to IC. You have, no doubt, heard of\napartheid which, as an Afrikaans word, means\n'separate development' but, in reality, spells a system of vicious oppression of the blacks in\nSouth Africa. Such a policy of deliberate\ndiscrimination against a racial group,\nenshrined in the constitution of a state, has not\nbeen seen anywhere in the world since the\ntime of the Nazis.\nBut isn't South Africa so far away from IC?\nWhy bother about apartheid when, after all,\nyou are here to get a degree? Well, since you\nare intelligent enough to make your way here,\nit seems likely that you are also capable of\nattaching a meaning to 'world peace', etc, and\nthat you occassionally think of other things\napart from your academic subjects.\nMany students here, who belong to the Anti\nApartheid Group, believe it is basically unfair\nto condemn a man to a life of misery and\noppression simply, and irrationally, because\nhis skin colour is of the \"wrong\" type. We also\nknow, from recent European history, that a ruthlessly executed policy of race hatred has\nthe capacity to throw the whole world in a. state of war and conflict. This is not a political\nview. It is essentially a 'human' problem. Thus,\nmembership of the Anti-Apartheid Group\nincludes socialists and liberals, religious people\nOn Friday we might make an adventurous\ntrip to outer suburbia and visit Richmond ice-rink. Details at Wednesday's meeting.\nSaturday meet at 3:00pm by Queens Tower\n(gives you time to go tid d ly winking) for an epic\njourney across the vast expanses of Hyde\nPark, through the maze of London' s side streets to Hinde Street; the home of our\nbeloved Chaplain. He will come forth and\nserve some culinary delight, after which we will\nescape into the world of the cinema.\nAll Wednesday meetings are held in 9a Princes Gardens (above Nightline). Everyone\nis welcome. For further details please contact\nSteve Palmer, Chem Eng 3, through the Chem\nEng letter-racks.\nCND\nOn October 26 1980, 80,000 people came\ntogether in London to march under the\nbanners of C ND. They came from many\ndifferent branches of politics and society, to\nprotest against the continuance of the arms\nrace and especially the new developments of\nCruise missiles and Trident submarines. Since\nthen a European-wide movement has grown\nup which has shown the massive grassroots\nsupport for disarmament throughout the\ncontinent.\nSaturday, October 24 is the date chosen\nthis year for another such demon strat on. The\nICC ND Group, founded after last year's march, is helping to organise a series of films\nand speakers around this day. This will again\nbe an opportunity for everyone at IC to\nconsider some of the issues involved and\nperhaps a chance to join and help run ICC ND. The success of this group depends on your\ninvolvement.\nThe introductory meeting for the group will\nbe early in the term\u2014look out for the notices,\nsee us at Freshers' Fair or contact me, Martin\nCasey, Physics PG( int 4183) or John Waterworth, CCD2. as well as agnostics, and several others\nwithout a label who abhor race hatred and\nneo-Nazism.\nYou may want to join the Anti-Apartheid\nGroup out of sympathy for the oppressed\npeople of South Africa. This is commendable.\nBut an equally important consideration is that\nof enlightened self-interest. Who doesn't know\ntoday how inter-connected the whole human\nrace is? It doesn't even require a war in the\nGulf for oil prices to rise all over the world. So\nwhat will happen to you if (or when) the\nholocaust comes to South Africa? Because the\nblacks in South Africa desire freedom as much\nas other people elsewhere\u2014by peaceful means\nif possible, and if not, by any means necessary\u2014apartheid will surely crumble.\nAlready many Africans in South Africa who\nhave attempted to use peaceful channels to\neffect change have been \" banned\", shot,\nimprisoned, or exiled to the notorious Robbens Island. Perhaps the best known is\nNelson Mandela. School children who have\nprotested against oppression were shot down\nin Soweto by the South African government.\nAnd only recently South Africa invaded\nAngola in a reckless exercise that could have\nled to the involvement of at least one major\nworld power. Do you need further persuasion\nof the ugliness and danger of apartheid?\nYes or no, we'd like to see you at Freshers'\nFair, or later on in some of our functions. Last\nyear we made some impact.

Against two ol the best\nuniversity teams (especially Exeter) we\ndid well to hang on to a draw. Exeter put\non more than160 for the 1s twicket and looked a great side, though White(52) did his best to prove otherwise.\nThe only tour loss was to Yel vert on, who surprisingly enough were the worst\nteam we played. Again, I CCC, sadly\nshort ol men, were up against it from the\nstart. Bell confirmed his intentions and realised his potential with a magnificent golden duck. White was there again, and J.

White(54) and the stumpy chimp, Everett(37) were the main contributors, though Bell's rain dance was certainly worthy oi\nmention. In fact.( Do nger) Bell, throughout the tour, showed a greater\naccumulation ol gallons-Qf-beer, than for\nruns.\nI CCC won both the last two limited overs matches in very close finishes over\nthe home sides. \" Chump y\" Everett was\nfined for \" jug avoidance\" with a slimy, cowardly49 \u2014 a real captain's innings.\nBatsman of the tour must have been\nnext year's skipper,\" C hocky\" White for\nhis consistent run making, though Everett's114 takes some beating.\" Big Band\".

Yet aga an we maintained our I<)<> \"\u00ab record.\nAs usual wc stayed in a cardboard caravan near Weymouth. With no match until Tuesday we spent most of\nour time playing Pu em an in the local arcades, and watching impromptu ll o or shows in the Gloucester Hotel bar at\nlunchtimes. Tuesday came along and we were all looking forward to playing Bournemouth. However, tensions rose during the day and these were released in an all out\nrevenge attack on the Captain's far too\ngaseous bowels, instead ol against Bournemouth. This action unfortunately resulted in invaliding Dave for the rest ol the tour. However, both John and Cl ill managed, between them, to cover Dave' s goalkeeper position and we won the first match by 6:2.\nThe following day we played the Army team at B ovington. We gave a clinical display of polo against a team whose only tactics were to field fourteen\nplayers against the usual seven allowed, liven so, we still slaughtered them, even Jim actually managed to score lots ol\ngoals.\nThursday came along too quickly lor everyone, with the match nobody wanted, against Bridport in the local river! Everything seemed to be against\nus, the water was freezing, the current appeared to change every quarter to\nfavour the home team and our happily injured Captain was tel. Somehow we managed a7:2 victory. Barry became the only p laver to be sent off during the\ntour, though this may have been a prior arrangement with the rel so that he\ncould relieve his bladder yet again.

    "content": "FELIX Guide to the First Week\na view from the side\nOn arrival at Imperial College, most\npeople have little idea where the\nvarious places of importance are\nlocated within the College. To remedy\nthis situation the College and Union\nconspire on the first day to send\nfresher s on a sometimes fruitless\nsearch around College for Unioncard,\ngrant cheque and registration slip.\nOn Monday morning queues of almost\nBiblical proportions build up in the J CR as\nmost students attempt to register. The experienced student would probably wait to\nregister when the Rector's Reception takes\nplace at 10:00am. This event, which all first\nyears feel obliged to attend, usually records\na resounding zero on the c lapo meter with\nthe Rector, Lord Flowers, delivering his only\nspeech yet again. When they have wheeled\nthe old duffer off, the Union Sabbatical\nOfficers reread last year's Fresher s' Reception speeches,\" get involved... rewarding... UG Msa must etc, etc.\" This\nends at 11:00am leaving enough time for you\nto find your department f pr their intro-duct ion; you will have a chance to meet\nyour tutors for the first time. At this point\nthe difficulty of the course and the failure\nrates are usually mentioned, as there is no\nneed for the \"nice guy\" image now that\nyou're here.\nIn the afternoon there is one timetabled\nevent, the C CU UG Ms. These are a must\nfor those in need of comic relief, or a chance\nto beat the registration queues in the J CR. That evening the Union Building will house\nthe new year party, a must with many fab\nbands, and an introduction to levels of\ndepravity to which people can plummet.\nTuesday morning is spent in your department where the course is explained in\ngreater detail. At this time juncture the\ndedication needed to complete the course is\nraised in graphic detail. However, one does\nnot need to be Saint Augustine to graduate.\nThe afternoon is devoted to \"Freshers' Fair\"\nwhere all the Union clubs and societies run\na stall. The societies, which are as diverse as\nBadge Soc (exiled to the Brown Committee\nRoom) and Chinese Soc, do their best to\nobtain your support and signature.\nOf course, the highlight of the afternoon\nfor many is a visit to the FELIX Office,\nwhere the Editor tries to cream off the most\ninteresting and talented of the new arrivals\n(sentence: three years hard labour).\nBy Wednesday your each your first\nlecture and comedown to earth. By tradition this is delivered by the most boring\nmember of the dep arment. In the afternoon the sports trials take\nplace. The squads are picked early in the\nsession, so if you wish to play for ICU or\nyour C CU you must take part in these\ntrials. There is an RCS Pub Crawl in the\nevening\u2014it is an event which is traditionally\nbawdy and gross.\nThursday abounds with lectures and labs.\nThe Freshers' U GM takes place at 1:00pm. This is usually a forum for various Union Officers, who strive to humiliate each other\nand indulge in backstabbing. Rumours abound that this year the executive will\ndeliver their speeches naked to boost attendances! In the evening the Ents film\nseason begins with Assault on Precinct 13, a glorious example of senseless violence. The latter part of the evening is enlivened by the\ncollation of FELIX. This takes place from\nabout 9:00pm. The Editor usually regales\nthe colla tors with various items that were\neither too libellous or indecent to print.\nSTAFF VACANCIES\nAt Imperial College you have the\nchance to work on one of the most\nexciting student newspapers in the\ncountry. There are still vacancies\nfor:\nNews reporters\nPhotographers\nReviewers\nArtists\nTechnical Staff\nIf you are interested or would like to\nsuggest your own ideas then come\nn to the FELIX Office (on the right\nunder Beit Arch) at Freshers' Fair or\nthe to the first Staff Meeting at\n12:30pm on Friday.\nBy Friday everything starts to become\nrather normal. In the evening the dregs of\nC& GU who did pass their exams hold a Guilds Bar Night \u2014 an event traditionally\nboth bawdy and gross. Ah well at least\nthere's FELIX every Friday.\nFELIX Check List\n1. Registration. Monday and Tuesday in\nthe S CR on Level 2 in the Sherfield Building.\nSubsequently on Level 3 in the Sherfield\nBuilding. Bring a pen and retain the stamped\nslip.\n2. Unioncards.In the J CR Monday and\nTuesday, for the rest of the week in the\nUnion Senior Common Room and subsequently in the Union Office.

    "content": "CLUBS AND SOCIETIES\nIslamic\nThe Islamic Society caters for daily prayers,\nFriday prayers and other general requirements\nfor Muslims; it also invites everyone to come\nand find o uk for himself about Islam.\nThis year we managed to acquire a room for\nour activities through the tireless effort and\ndedication of the members. As such we would\nlike to see all our members, together with all\nthe Muslims at College, making use of the\nfacilities provided.\nThe society's activities are published by IC\nDiary and for any other information, come and\nmeet us at the Freshers' Fair. We organise\nArabic classes for beginners and intermediates.\nOn Mondays discussion groups are held\nduring lunchtime at our room in 9 Princes\nGardens (basement) at 1:00pm. Ents\nWelcome to Impcol etc, just a reminder\nfor you to pop in and see us all at the Freshers'\nFair (the room with the imaginative colour\nscheme) and we'll give you more information\nabout us.\nOur film list is included somewhere in this\nFELIX. Our films are shown in Me ch Eng 220\n(ask anyone for directions). On Thursday\nnights from 6:30pm onwards (come along to\nhelp at 6:00pm). The Freshers' Concert is on October 14 in\nthe Great Hall. All the bands are new and\ninteresting. Weapon of Peace are a really fab\nIt always strikes me as a bit odd that many\npeople whose working life consists largely of\nabstract reasoning will happily indulge in still\nmore cerebral callisthenics during their leisure\ntime. Nevertheless it is for these perverse\nindividuals (among whom, of course, I count\nmyself) that I write what has become one of\nthe most popular regular columns in FELIX.( Modesty never was my greatest virtue...).\nTwelve months of composing puzzles have\nprovoked a number of people to ask me how\n(or even whether) this column is organised and\nI felt that while introducing myself to fresher s and welcoming them, I would also take the\nopportunity to reply.\nPerhaps the most common question I am\nasked concerns the number of students who\nsolve the puzzle each week. The number of\nsolutions I receive varies from none at all to\nthirty or so, with ten being about typical.\nConsequently, if you enter regularly, you are\nalmost certain to win a prize at least once a term. But many people never bother to send\nme their solution. I am constantly amazed by\nthe number of people who come up to me (I speak of those who have penetrated my cloak\nof pseudonym it y) and tell me that they often\nsolve the puzzles but never enter the\ncompetition. Now I realize IC has a reputation\nfor apathy to maintain, but the number of\nstudents who can afford to turn down a fiver,\nhaving done the work for it, can surely be\ncounted on the fingers of one foot.\nThe other topic I am quizzed on is the\nsource of my puzzles. Well, in the words of\nIsaac Asimov: \"I make 'em up, see!\" Some are\npure invention, others are based on ideas\nwhich come up in obscure mathematical textbooks, discussion with friends, or even\n(heaven forbid) my work. Since I am not a reggae band; the Flying Padovanis are the\nshadows of the eighties; and, Everest the\nHardway are a hardworking bunch who have\nbeen seen and enjoyed by nearly everyone in\nEnts.\nOur Disco will be hitting the road soon, so\nany budding DJs out there can come along\nand have a bash. Incidentally, the Disco can be\nhired (with lights) on the cheap. Come to the\nEnts Room or phone 589-8238.\nIf you don't get a chance to come in at the\nFresher s' Fair, we meet every Monday lunchtime, feel free to come in and insult the\nexecutive (God knows they need insulting!).\nChemical\nThe Chemical Society (Chem Soc) exists to\npromote an interest in chemistry by organising\na programme of lectures and social events.\nThe lecture topics tend to be very wide ranging\nand last year included lectures on 'Chemistry\nin Cooking' and 'Forensic Science' lectures\nplanned for this year include 'The Chemistry\nand Physics of Cigarette Smoking' and 'Chemistry and Plants'. Our activities are\naimed mainly at chemists, but if you're not a chemist and would like to come along we'll be\nvery pleased to see you.\nOur first lecture this term is on 8 October\nand is entitled 'Wines of the World' by S Ayers\n(from S to wells of Chelsea) followed by a cheese and wine party.\nOther lectures this term will be publicised in\nFELIX and on the chemistry department noticeboards. So hope to see you there or at\nFreshers' Fair.\nworld-class chess player, I rely on my friend\nGrey Spider (who is!) to provide me with\nbizarre and ingenious chess puzzles. And just\noccasionally, when I'm particularly pressed for\ntime, I will adapt and disguise a puzzle from\nanother setter, the New Scientist being my\nfavourite source. (And if anyone thinks such\ncribbing is parasitic, I would encourage them\nto study my column in FELIX of October 10th,1980 and compare it with the New Scientist of\nApril 2nd,1981!)I also invite friends and regular solvers to\ncompose puzzles too, so if any of you want to\nset a puzzle, I 'll be happy to consider anything\nyou have to offer.\nI take great personal pride in the appearance\nand layout of the column, doing all my own\nproofreading, and much of the typesetting,\npasting up, and artwork, too. I mention this\nnot out of boastfulness (much) but to reassure\nyou that every precaution is taken to make\nsure the puzzles are correct; there's nothing\nmore frustrating than spending several hours\nfailing to solve a puzzle only to discover that\nthere was a misprint in the setting. In fact, only\nonce has FELIX been issued with an insoluble\npuzzle, although on two further occasions the\nsolution has not been unique. One of these\nwas in the postgraduate FELIX, so the puzzle\nin that issue has been grovelling ly withdrawn.\nSince many members of college have ready\naccess to a computer, I try to avoid puzzles\nwhich are easily solved on a machine. On the\nother hand, since IC is one of the top scientific\nestablishments in the country, I have no\ncompunction in setting problems which need\nsome slight mathematical ability to solve them.\n(Quickie: in your head work out the number of\nterms in the expansion of\n(x a)( x b)(xc)...( x z). Answer next issue.)\nAll the puzzles are sponsored by Mend-a Bike, a firm I can personally recommend very\nstrongly indeed. They sell new bikes from \u00a365,\nsecond-hand bikes for even less. They are the\nOSC\nThe OS C is made up of nine societies at the\nmoment. They are the Afro Caribbean, Hellenic, India, Latin American, Iranian,\nChinese, Turkish, Pakistan and Sri Lanka\nSocieties. An Egyptian Society, Bangladesh\nSociety and and International Society may be\nformed soon. All these societies, as well as the\nOS C, organise numerous events to help make\noverseas students enjoy their stay at Imperial\nCollege. It is essential that you join at least one\nof these societies because they are there for\nyou. All the societies are run by dedicated\nstudents who want to make them as successful\nas possible.\nYou may ask \"What's on?\" Well, firstly,\nthere will be a reception for all overseas\nfresher s in Mechancia! Engineering Room 220,\non the morning of Tuesday, October6. Secondly, the Freshers' Fair, which takes\nplace in the afternoon of Tuesday, October 6\nin the Beit Quadrangle and on the Queen's Lawn. Come there even if you are not a Fresher and meet the club executives, find out\nwhat the clubs do, what they have planned,\nand most importantly, give them your departmental address so they can get in touch\nwith you. This is extremely important so that\nyou can be informed about what is going on.\nThirdly, on Wednesday, October 14, there\nwill be a Cheese and Wine reception in ME220. Afterwards there will be a film show: Wild\nGeese starring Roger Moore, Richard Burton,\nRichard Harris and Hardy Kruger. Further\n'activities will be publicised in FELIX, IC Diary,\netc.\nclosest bike shop to college; they are the only\nbike shop in London who do repairs in 24\nhours and they give up to 10% discount to\nFELIX readers. They're at Park Walk Garage,\n10, Park Walk SW10, or phone them on 352\n3999.\nAdvertisements over, all that remains is to\nencourage you to write: criticize the puzzles\nyou don't like, ask for more of those you do,\nsend puzzles for publication, donate prizes to\npublicise your society...\nFinally, the traditional bit about hoping that\nyou enjoy solving the things as much as I enjoy\nsetting them. And so to this week's puzzle:\nFreshers' Hall Hunt\nI have been trying to trace four old friends\nwho are starting at IC this year. I know that\nthey are all in different departments, and they\nhave all been billeted in different halls, but for\nmore information I have had to rely on my\nnotebook. However, I find that I have\ncombined carelessness with accuracy as only a puzzle-setter can, and half of each of these five\nstatements is true, and half is false.\nSimon is in Beit and Tim is in Garden.\nQuentin is in Weeks and Richard is in\nGarden.\nMy friend in Southside is studying Aeronautics and Tim is a Biochemist.\nRichard is studying Civil Engineering and my\nfriend in Weeks is in DoC. Quentin is in Garden and Simon is in DoC. So who lives where studies what?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o FELIX Office by 1:00pm on Wednesday week.\nThere is a prize of \u00a35 for the correct solution\nrandomly selected at that time.\nSince lack of space prohibits printing the\nsolutions to the summer puzzles, they will\nappear in Friday's FELIX, and the deadline for\nreplies is extended to 1:00pm this Wednesday,\nOctober 7th.

Bearing in mind the motion to this meeting and my\narticle in Felix, I will not add anything here. HALL RENTS& M Q NTP E LIER STREET. I am pleased the College managed to purchase a newhall in Montpelier Street. It will house84 postgraduates. This has meant are distribution of P.G.' s from the other halls and the houses so that all categories of residents( and especially fresher s) have gained places in College Residence. The mortgage and renovation of the hall have put a great strain on the residence account. This has meant small increases in rent above those agreed at the end of last term. POSTGRADUATE AFFAIRS. I remain worried about the whole question of research supervision and writing up Ph.D's on time. However, when I asked P.G.' s if they thought they had a problem in the P.G. Felix, I got only five replies. I make one more appeal for information over this issue before I aes ume the problem does not exist. LECTURER TRAINING AND USE OF FEEDBACK QUESTIONNAIRES. I am currently trying to initiate some discussion on undergraduate teaching amongst the departments. I will report back my success/ failure to get anywhere.\" ULTRA VIRE S\".I will report verbally. BARS. The Lower Lounge has been improved. From the Bar Committee side we have put real ales in that bar. We\nhave also introduced a guest ale in this bar and in Southside. The guest ale will be replaced monthly. The Refectory Committee has agreed a discount period for beers in the Union and Southside. This is only up to the end of October, when prices will go back above the level of the end of last term. Relative to last session's prices, beer will be up2 pap in t and other drinks4%. These rises are due to increases in staff wages. They are not brewery rises, these will still be passed on if they come in. REFECTORIES. Again there have been increased staff costs here. Also there has been an increase in the overheads the refectory account must bear, due to removal of half the UGC subsidy, another immediate effect of the cuts. The net result of this has been an increase in prices of8.5%. This will be the only increase this year apart from regulator increases( I'll explain the latter verbally to first years). NUS. The President of NUS, Mr. Dave Aaron ov itch, has agreed to address the next U GM. Does anybody wish to take advantage of this? DEPUTY PRESIDENT'S REPORT SHOP A decision was made at a Bookshop Committee meeting last year to take the regalia( ties, scarves, cuff links etc.) out of the bookshop and leave the organisations with which the items are connected to sell them themselves. This however, I have since realised would have been totally impractical. After much deliberation, consultation, and investigation I decided the best possibility for dealing with the situation was to setup another shop. The President and myself set about producing some figures and looking into the possible administrative setups. A meeting was held at which myself, Mr. Morton and Mr. Rush ton, together with members of the refectory administration were present, and the present setup is the result of that meeting. The expanded Southside Shop is now a\" joint venture\" between the Union and Refectories. It has a committee with a student majority, and it sells a much greater range of products than ever before. One especial feature, of which I hope many will take advantage, is the exceptionally cheap, but high quality, sports equipment. The trading figures will be monitored closely over this term and a full scale review will be conducted at Christmas. I hope suggestions will come fort has to new\nareas of selling for the shop and that it provides a useful service. LOWER LOUNGE Alterations in this area were, I feel, very necessary, as the carpets tank and the general decor was scruffy due to the way people treated it. I have endeavour ed to make it\" nicer\" without interfering with the Wednesday lunchtime gatherings. Hopefully it will be used more now that Mr. Morton has organised real a leto be served there. During July there was a series of breakin' s to the games machines. The Police have been kept informed of the details but so far their ph or en sic experts have not come up with anything. CLOAKROOM The old cloakroom in the Union Building will now be used as astore for the various clubs which have asked me for one subject, of course, to the approval of the House Committee. "

    "content": "Lounge\ncarve up\nA PARTITION has been\nerected in the Union Lower Lounge and new carpeting fitted at an estimated cost of\n\u00a32,500.\nThe decision to go ahead was\ntaken by the Union Executive in early September. The Lounge was in a poor condition at the time,' with damaged seats and a badly stained carpet. It was felt that\nthe atmosphere in the bar would be considerably improved if the games machines were separated from the bar area.\nThe grant earmarked for\nthe upkeep of the Union Building is administered by\nthe College, meaning that the\nEstates Section were asked to\nput the job out lor tender. An estimate of \u00a3 1 , 5 8 8 was received for the installation of\nthe partition alone, a figure\nclose to that which the\nExecutive had been prepared to spend on the entire set of\nalterations, including the new carpet. However, the goa head was given and the job started on September24. The additional cost of the carpet\nwas in the region of \u00a31,000.\nWorkmen laying the carpet\nsoon discovered that their specifications did not match the half completed partition. In fact, the partition was\napproximately1 ft Gins too\nshort horizontally, the mistake being due to an error on the\nplans drawn up by the Estates\nSection. The work is expected to be\nfinished by today and Jimmy Carroll, the Union Bar Manager confidently intends\nto open for business as usual.\nInitially, the Executive had also intended to have purpose built benches installed and to make minor alterations above the bar counter. However, the estimates received for these jobs were so\nlarge that they were rendered infeasible. Nevertheless, Real Ale is to introduced in the\nLounge Bar this session.\nNew shop for old site\nCollege and Union to share profits\nThe Southside Shop has been greatly expanded in order to sell a wider range of\nitems, including the Union regalia which was purchased from the IC Bookshop at\nthe end of last term.\nCollege snaps up hall\nKnightsbridge residence for PGs\nEIGHTY FOUR POSTGRADUATE students have been\nhoused in a newhall which the College purchased during Summer vacation. 'Fhe building, situated in Montpelier Street, is very close to\nCollege and was constructed in1890. It was used as a nurses\nhome for St George's Hospital until1979 and has since been empty. 'Fhe property was first put up for sale at Easter and the\nCollege's original bid was rejected. Other concerns sought to red eve lop the prime Knights bii d ge site into luxury flats, but as\nthe building was originally constructed with the money ol a generous benefactor, a condition existed that it should remain hostel accommodation. This meant that a second bid from the\nCollege was accepted in late July despite higher offers l rom business concerns.\nThe building's state of repair was reasonable. There was an amount ol deterioration following two years ol neglect and complete refurbishment was nec es sar ry before habitation was\npossible. Some external repairs and communal areas will have a lower priority than the preparation of bedrooms and may no l be\ncompleted until alter residents move in. Although the Hall will only be used to house postgraduates,\ntheir overall number in College residence will only increase in\nproportion. There will be more places available in the current Halls and Houses for fresher s and li rst time applicants as a result.\nA new sub warden, Crispin Dobson, has been appointed, who will be responsible to the Senior Warden, Dr Don Mon ro. After the Union had purchased the entire supply ol regalia from the Bookshop it\nbecame apparent that it could not be sold from the Union Office, as had been expected.\nIt was suggested that a small LJ ni on shop could be set up in the old cloakroom underneath the main Union Building staircase, which would be\nrun by apart time assistant or\none of the present stall.\nWhen Nick Morton. ICU President, mentioned the idea to Dr Sch roter, Chairman ol\nR elector y Committee, a joint venture was proposed between College and the Union. A wall between the old South side Shop and the adjoining room was demolished, which doubled its size. This made room for a wider range ol goods, including the regalia and a new range of quality sports goods. The profits will be shared between the Union and Refectory accounts. Nick Morton said that the\nExecutive had been amazed at how willing the College Estates and Domestic sections\nhad been to help.\nLook out\nBelow!\nCONCRETE FELL from the\nside of Weeks Hall in early September, narrowly missing last year's FELIX Editor, Steve Marshall. A wooden platform supported by scaffolding has been placed over the\nentrance to the hall in order to\nstop any further material which may fall.\nA piece of concrete approximately4 ft by Gins by 3in s fell\nfrom the seventh floor, shatter-ing just by the entrance to the\nbuilding. The fall occurred at\nabout3 am, but unfortunately one person was still in the\nvac in it y at that hour. The College Estates Section have inspected the building, and say that more concrete could fall. The wooden platform should adequately protect passers-by.\nEXEC VIEWS\nWelcome! And welcome back! Those of you who are new will\nrapidly gain the impression that the Union and its facilities are\ncompletely sham boli c. However, the old lags may notice one\nor two changes for the better (that is if they have learnt to\nkeep their eyes open since we last saw them).\nYou can now buy extremely cheap, quality sports gear. This\ncan be found in the recently expanded Southside Shop. It is on\nsale alongside regalia (scarves, ties, slop shirts, etc) and the\ntraditional range of groceries. We believe this is a valuable\naddition to the Union's services.\nThe Lower Lounge in the Union Building has had a facelift.\nFrom now on, not only will you be sitting in pleasant\nsurroundings but also you will be offered a variety of real ales.\nThe bars are offering discounts on some beers this month\n(see ad in this FELIX). We hope you are taking advantage of\nthis, we certainly are!\nThis week sees the first Union General Meeting (UGM) of\nthe session. It will take place at 1:00pm on Thursday,\nOctober 8, in the Great Hall. Read Exec News to find out what\nis going on then come and see it all happen for real.\nAnd finally we must remind you that tonight marks the birth\nof a new tradition. The combined skills of the entire ICU\nExecutive bring you the New Year's Party.\nN,B& M FELIX, October 5, 1981 Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "EDUCATION CUTS\nby Nick Morton, ICU President\nThe cuts! You've read about them in newspapers, seen\ninformation about them on TV, now here is a summary in\nFELIX. I am sorry this article is long, but please read it.\nThis article is about the cuts in student numbers and\nmoney made to individual universities by the University\nGrants Commission (UGC). Here goes\nOver the next three or four years\nthere is to be a cut in home and\nEEC student numbers of over 4%.\nThere has also a been a financial\ncut averaging roughly 17% over\nthe next three years, part of this\ncut being due to the removal of\nthe subsidy on overseas students.\nThe UGC has been selective\nand has not applied cuts on a pro-rata basis. This means that\nsome universities have escaped\nvery lightly, (e.g. Oxford and\nCambridge, make of that what\nyou will!) and others have become famous for really suffering the axe. These are Aston,\nBradford. Hull, Keele, Salford\nand Stirling. These universities\nhave had severe reductions in\nboth student numbers and grants.\nThe effect of the drop in places\navailable has meant many-students who previously may have got to university through\nUCC A's clearing system will be\nunsuccessful this year. Also universities have been strict on\nexactly meeting A Level entrance\nrequirements, e.g. if asked lor\nCCC, AAD may not be accepted.\nThe unsuccessful university candidates may become unemployed or apply to Polytechnics\nand Colleges of Further E duca tion. Regretably these institutions are also under scrutiny and\ncertainly not expanding, so\nsomeone somewhere will lose out\naltogether on a place in Higher\nEducation. All this is happening\nwhen the demand for plates is\nincreasing.\nThe effects of the financial cuts\nhave been severe economies in\nmany universities, frantic efforts\nlo raise money from alternative\nsources and to \"light the cuts\".\nClosure of whole departments\nand even the possibility ol whole\nuniversities going bankrupt have\nbeen on everybody's mind.\nIn all the letters sent to the\nuniversities, the UGC \"advised'\"\non how individual subject areas\nwere to be increased, left alone,\nrational is ed or completely withdrawn. This has meant the\ncommittee were selective both\nin terms of institutions affected\nand where they felt the cutbacks\nshould occur within them.\nQuite how the selectivity of the\ncuts was calculated is still not\nclear, despite the availability of\nevidence presented to a Com mons Select Committee by the\nUGC. They collected a limited\namount of information from various bodies including industry\n(as potential employers), the\nuniversities and the research\ncouncils. The UGC may also\nhave used data collected in its\nown surveys but some of the\ndepartments suggested lor rational is ation or closure have-not been visited by the UGC for\nover a decade.\nLondon University\nLondon has been cut in terms ol\nboth numbers and grant in line\nwith the national average. London University, as a whole,\n.receives a block grant from the\nUGC. The University Court then distributes this money as it\nsees lit amongst the schools and\ninstitutes except for Imperial College. This is important; this\nyear, as in all previous years, part\nof the grant given to London\nUniversity is actually earmarked\nlor Imperial College. The Court\nhas made its grant allocations,\neffectively acting as a mini UGC to the colleges. As yet, I am\nunsure who the losers are amongst the other London colleges, but like the UGC, the\nCourt has been selective. As well\nas distributing the money, the\nCourt has also given provisional\nindication ol student numbers to\nbe met by each of the University's institutions by 1983/4.\nImperial College\nIC will actually have an increase\nin home and EEC student numbers. We are to get an extra\none hundred and seventy students\nby 1983/4. Fifty of these are\nimmediately absorbed by Greece'sentry into the EEC moving students out ol the\noverseas into the home category.\nThat still means we are to gain\nforty home and EEC students per\nannum over the next three years.\nThe College has roughly followed\nthe UGC' s advice in terms of\nwhich departments the extra students will go (o. Financially the College has\nbeen cut 14.8% in real terms over\nthe next three years. At current\nlevels this means a cut ol //1.3m for 1981 '2 and//0.9 man d/'O. bb m in the following years.\nThis is slightly better than the\nnational average but is still a lot\nof money. Substantial economy\nmeasures are necessary.\nUGC money represents about\nhall the College income. The\nremainder comes from fees (paid\nb v Local Education Authorities\nfor home students) and from\noutside earnings.\nHome and EEC lee income\nwill remain steady but income\nfrom overseas students will probably drop as their numbers\nfall, this decrease being due to\nthe government's policy of charging \" lull cost fees\". The\nRector and the College arc-looking to boost outside earnings\nby canvassing industry lor support and by setting up interdepartmental sections.\nThe Economies\nThis is where the effects of the\ncuts are felt by students. First let\nme say that the student union\nshould not have a great deal of\ntrouble running on their budget\nfor 1981 2 but could have more\ndifficulties in successive years as\nthe cuts bite. Other non-academic\nareas have been cut bark. e.g. the\nrefectory account must bear more of its own overheads and\ntelephone calls between 9:00am and 1:00pm have been restricted.\nThe departments have been\nput on a shoestring survival budget. This will undoubtedly\naffect teaching and research.\nUndergraduates may lind themselves doing less practical work or\ndoing less refined, cheaper practical work. Both undergrads\nand post grads will probably be\nusing cheaper or dated equip-ment. It is for these reasons that I believe you should all be sitting\nup and taking note of this whole\nsituation, (though if you've read\nthis far you are probably interested anyway).\nThe major expenditure in College is in salaries and wages.\nThis has meant a temporary freeze on stall recruitment and\nlor the next three years a close\nscrutiny will be kept on replacing\npeople who retire or move on. It\nis hoped that about hall the\npeople leaving over this period\nw ill not be replaced. The effect of\nthis is that a number of people\nare going to have to work harder\nto cover the unfilled posts. This\nmay well not be a bad thing in\nmany cases but again it could\naffect students. There could be a decrease in technician support as\nthey cover elsewhere or administrative matters may take longer.\nThere are many more possible\neffects and I 'll let you think about\nthem for yourselves.\nWhen discussing wage savings\nI have assumed people will leave\nby natural wastage. The College\nbelieve natural wastage will be\nsufficient over the next year if the\ntrade unions co-operate. How ever, they are not willing to rule\nout the possibility of redundancies over the following two years.\nThe Campaign Universities, trade unions and\nstudent unions up and down the\ncountry have been very quick to\nreact to the cuts. In many places\nall people involved have got\ntogether to form joint campaigning bodies. Salford has attracted\na lot of support and revenue Irom\nindustry. Perhaps this is just what\nthe UGC was aiming lor. In\nother universities the campaign\nhas been thought about and not\nlaunched so rapidly in the belief\nthat there is not point campaigning over the summer when MPs and academies alike are sunning\nthemselves on the Costa del Sol.\nIn all places the campaign must\ntake the form of lobbying MPs, other influential people and ol\ncourse parents. Parents of school\nchildren are important votes\n\u2022 when it comes to an election;\ntheir belief is that they must be\nshown that their children now\nhave significantly decreased opportunities lor attending universities.\nOpinions\nI don't think the UGC should be\ntaking the blame for making the\ncuts as these were toned upon\nthem by the government. How ever, the government have shown\nsome flexibility to pressure already. Dr Rhodes Boyson (ex-Junior Minister lor Higher Education) has recently said that\nthe student totals given by the\nUGC were indications, not\ninstructions. This is certainly a very different interpretation from\nthe way everybody read it back\nin July. I believe the principle ol\neducation cuts imposed by this\ngovernment is wrong and short-sighted. I feel the same way\nabout the imposition of \"full cost\nfees\" lor overseas students. I further believe students in this\ncountry should be telling the\ngovernment they have got it\nwrong but they must do this\nwithout further tarnishing the\npoor reputation students have.\nWithout some reaction we may-experience further cutbacks.\nWe could argue for evermore\nabout where the UGC should\nhave made their cuts. Undoubtedly they should have collected\nmore data but they were pushed\ninto this situation rather rapidly.\nA great deal of publicity has\nsurrounded the fact that the axe\nfell heavily on \" technological universities\" like Bradford and\nSallord and it seems the UGC were trying to I rim down fringe\nactivities to the mainstream technological departments at\nthese places. It should also be\nremembered that many other\nun iver is i ties specialising in science and engineering have\nescaped lightly, e.g. Cambridge,\nBath, and in terms of student\nnumbers. Imperial College. Having said all that I do believe\nthe UGC should have thought\nmuch harder before hitting technology which is surely the\nfuture of this country.\nMick (with a little help from my\nfriend, Martin)\nFELIX, October 5, 1981 Page 7\n\n"
