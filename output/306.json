The atmosphere at the\nstart of the meeting was not\nhelped by Strawberry refusing\nto address them until all the\nnon-University Colleges were\nremoved \u2014 no one left, although\nthere were definitely some non-University pe opie there.\nAfter only five minutes the\nmeeting had to be stopped, and\nthe room emptied due to heckling from a group of about 10-15\npeople. When it became apparent that these people would\nnot leave, another room was\nfound, however, the people who\nwere so keen to disrupt the\nmeeting, refused to let Strawberry enter. Most of the delegates then found themselves in\nthe in e quit us position of having\nto link arms and prevent fellow\nstudents from physically assaulting a man who they themselves\ndisliked.\nUnfortunately in the scuffle\nthat followed a large number\nof delegates were shut outside\nincluding Dave Amos and John\nMcCullough.\nAfter all that you would have\nthought that the Strawb would\nhave been worth listening to,\nbut he gave a wish y was hy, middle of the road compromise,\napologise type of talk and all\nthrough the questions gave the\nimpression that really he wants\nto implement a Registrar (as\nbacked by the Federation of\nConservative Students). All the\ntime he kept giving reassurances that we need not worry\nabout our clubs and societies\nand that really we would only\ndo better by his implementing\nthese ideas.\nIt was a pity that the atmosphere wasn't more open to\nfreer discussion, however it was\nuseful to speak to the man in\nperson.\nMURDER\nin the Great Hall\n\"Murder in the Cathedral\" is\npossibly the greatest English\nplay of this century \u2014 it is\nwithout doubt the most important Christian one. There is\nlittle action in it, this has \u2014 in\nthe best classical tradition \u2014 all\ntaken place before the play and\nwhat the audience sees in the\nfinal culmination of years' of\npast history, the top of an iceberg of follies and furies and is\nthus as inevitable and essential\nas death itself.\nThe reliance of the play in\nthe quality of the acting is therefore intensified because not\nonly must the themes be\nworked out and Becket's development from man to martyr be\nshown openly, but the audience\nmust have the opportunity to\nappreciate Eliot's verse and feel\nat the same time that the play\nconcerns every one of them\ndirectly.\nThe chorus of women is essential to the play like a Greek\nchorus it explains the drama,\nbut also it is through the chorus\nthat the relationship between\naudience and action is made.\nUnfortunately, the chorus found\nsome difficulty in acting together as a homogeneous unit\n\u2014they seemed indeed to be\nsacrificing dramatic effect in\norder to keep time \u2014 a wise\nprecaution for when they had to\nrun amok, each member overcome by horror and grief for\nthe future, the scene looked\nrather like something out of the\nMarat-Sade, not one hopes the\noriginal intention.\nPhil Rastell as Becket did\nnot have an easy task \u2014 it is\nhard to be essential and self-effacing at the same time and\non the whole he managed very\nwell indeed. He underplayed his\nlines rather, which although\nuseful in the second part of\nthe play does not fit in with the\nfirst part at all, because one\ncannot then appreciate Becket's transformation \u2014 his un importance as a person and his reduction to martyr days before\nhe is actually killed.\nEliot did not entirely approve\nof doubling the Knights and the\nTempters, but in this performance it worked well \u2014 mainly\nbecause the four actors involved were better than the\nothers. The second and fourth\ntempters were especially fluent\nand made Becket seem querulous by comparison. The ideas\nof the knights then justifying\nthe murder (which was by-the-by\nmore than a little overdone) on\none of those ghastly TV talk\nshows was sheer genius \u2014 it\nwas almost as if Eliot had\nforeseen the invention of the\nmedium. The danger, though,\nwith this presentation, was that\nit was such fun \u2014 echoes of\nSharian humour all round \u2014\nthat it was easy to forget just\nhow spacious were the arguments used.\nThe Great Hall is the sort of\nplace that lends itself to large-scale tragedies \u2014 especially if\nthey can fill up the space properly as this one did. Whether\nwe like it or not Christianity in\nvol ves us all in one way or\nanother, and it was interesting\nto see just how forcefully a performance of such a tragedy\ncan put across our involvement.\nANOTHER LETTER TO THE EDITOR The Executive Members of\nl.C. Ents. Committee have decided that some sort of reply\nis needed to answer the insinuations being put about college\nat present concerning the affairs of the committee. We consider that this publication is\nthe most suitable for expressing\nour opinions as we trust that\nyou will reproduce this letter\naccurately and legibly unlike a certain amateur publication.\nFirstly, we consider the\narticle published in 'Felix' dated\nNovember 4th, to be ill-informed.\nThe Union Executive is not\n'peeved' over the proposed\ntransfer of the hops, and the\narrangements have been settled\nto everyone's satisfaction. As\nto the previous concerts in the\nGreat hall, the overall balance\nis favourable. It also might be\nnoted that we do not have a grant, which necessitates our\ntaking some financial risks at\nthe beginning of the year. Unfortunately, some of these have\nnot lived up to our expectations,\nalthough our financial position\nbefore the robbery on 28th November was by no means as bad\nas had been stated in C.E.F. E. dated Monday, November 15th, and had it not been for the rob-be ry, we would now be in the\nblack.\nThe business over the Felix\nphotographer was unfortunate,\nand arose because we were not\ninformed of his wish to attend.\nWe hope that this does not\noccur again.\nCertain members of the Executive of the Committee have\nbeen the target for unfounded,\nmalicious insinuations in recent\nweeks. It appears that these\ninsinuations originated from\npeople within the committee\nwho seem determined to undermine the morale of the com\nmitte e, and also people's faith\nin the committee. As one might\nexpect from such people, no\nspecific allegations have been\nmade and until this occurs\nnone can be answered, although\nof course, it remains to be said\nthat we consider these allegations to be entirely groundless\nIt is interesting to note that\nat the time of the robbery there\nwas more than \u00a3100 of non\nEnts money in the safe, although\nthis was not touched when the\nEnts. takings were stolen.\nWe hope that this has cleared\nup some of the criticism of our\ncommittee and should there be\nany further concrete allegations\nwe would be pleased to answer\nthem to the best of our ability\nYours, etc.\nThe Executive of the\nEnts.

The climax of this work,\nso well controlled by James Stohart the conductor, set\na very high standard.\nThe soloist, Judy Swan, handled some very difficult\ndouble bowing in Walton's Violin Concerto masterfully.\nHer interpretation was invigorating and the orchestra\ntackled the rhythmic sections of this work not only with\nthought but with panache. This was especially noticeable in the Vivo con molto pre c iso which was the most\ndifficult movement of the evening.\nAt the interval, I found it difficult that the standard\nof playing could be raised for the Tchaikovsky 4th Symphony. This was, in fact, even a higher standard, and\nundoubtedly the best produced by the orchestra for some\ntime. All the entries were split second accurate and the\npizzicato section of Scherzo was a delight to listen to.\nThe Finale left the audience wanting more and special\nmention of any one section of the orchestra would be\nunjust as each played equally well.\nCongratulations, IC Symphony Orchestra, for providing the audience with a splendid evening.\nNick Feldman\nIn 1900 Edward Elgar wrote what is now recognised\nas one of the greatest choral works of all; it stands with\nthe Requiems of Verdi and of Brahms, and has perhaps\nonly been equalled since by Benjamin Britten's \"War\nRequiem\".\nIn the period 1800-1900 the output of continental\nmusical masterpieces was enormous: composers such as\nBeethoven, Schubert, Verdi, Wagner and Brahms dominated the musical scene. Yet during this period there\nwas no major English musical composition in the top\nrank whatever. Elgar's \"Dream of Gerontius\" was the\nfirst great English choral work since \"Messiah\" (if\nHandel's may be counted as English music), and it had\neverything: inspiration, drama, melody, stupendous solo\nroles, and magnificent writing for a large choir and a vast orchestra.\nI.C. Choir's performance of \"The Dream\" on March\n17th next must rank as one of I.C.'s most important\nmusical events ever, and the opportunity to take part\nis something which no student who counts himself musical should miss. The purpose of this note is to let al!\nsuch students know that the rehearsals start this term,\non December 16th. It's not an easy work\u2014the Demon's Chorus is infamous as well as fabulous \u2014 and Choir\nmembers will need to start at the beginning.\nRehearsals are on Thursdays at 5.30 p.m. in Room\n342, Mech. Eng. Men from I.C. only \u2014 girls from colleges all over London.\nD.J. WATERHOUSE\n\n"

Winter Vlll's regatta, and\nnotched up their first vic-tory, when the 1st VIII won\nthe Winter Vlll's Cup in the\nOpen Division.\nThe competition held at\nthe U.L. Boat House is a London colleges affair\nwith representatives from\nmost of the college Boat\nClubs. The races are divided up into Novice,\nJunior and Open divisions,\nrowed over a course of\njust over half a mile from\nabove U.L. boat house to\nthe 'Ship' beyond Chiswick Bridge. The river\nwas relatively placid for a November day, and with\nvarious divisions, some\nsuccess was assured.\nThe Open Division had\nthree l.C. crews in it, the\n1st and 2nd Vlll's and a3rd VIII containing four\nPurple trialist s. The first\nround was a little un for tu nate, as due to a misunderstanding over the time of\nthe race, Wye College did\nnot appear for their first\nrace against the 2nd VIII,\nwho were subsequently\nrowed against the 1st VIII\nand London Hospital. The\n1st VIII beat London Hospital and predictably beat\nthe 2nd VIII. In the other\nheat the 3rd VIII beat St.\nBarts. Hospital comfort-ably, but lost in the semifinal to St. Mary's Hospital. The 1st VIII in their\nsemi-final beat Wye College easily to reach the\nfinal against St. Mary's and\nU.C. This proved an exacting race with l.C. rowing off at forty-four and\njust creeping ahead of\nU.C. they rowed over at\nthirty-seven and spurted\nhome at thirty-nine, three-quarter length up on U.C. with St. Mary's in 3rd pos i tion. The crew consisted\nof: (Bow) B.J. McDouall,\nJ.C. Nicholls, P.E. Rowley, A. Azzaro, W.S. Kwiatkowski, A. Hill, T.S. Hooton, A.P. Chippendale\n(str.), P. Clarke (cox).\nIn the junior Division\nboth l.C. crews got\nthrough the first round.\nThe 4th XIII rowed over\nafter Guys scratched, and\nthe Lightweight VIII beat\nBirkbeck College by 1\u00a3\nlengths. These two crews\nmet St. Thomas's Hospital\nin the final, and St.\nThomas's, a powerful and\nwell disciplined crew, with\nseveral Henley oarsmen,\nproved their worth by beating the 4th VIII by H lengths and leaving the\nLightweight crew slightly\nflustered in 3rd position.\nThanks to all the crews\nand coaches for a good\neffort.\nSoCCer Club Badminton With only a couple of league games remaining this\nterm, the strength of the separate teams are now emer g ing. The 1st and 2nd XI are both still unbeaten and\nboth have the ability to win their respective leagues.\nThe 3rd XI, having won their last three games, look\nto have the skill to maintain a very respectable league\nposition. The 4th XI maintain an excellent team spirit\nand also an unbeaten record, but several points have\nslipped away in their last three drawn games. The 5th XI have at last broken their duck by taking a point off\nQEC II, but there is no holding the 5th XI. Under\ntheir captain Tony Ranger (who has scored 17 goals out\nof 32 this season) they have a tremendous team spirit\nand an excellent record. The 7th XI must be congratulated on their return to winning ways and also on their\nenthusiasm in the face of annoying late team changes\n\u2014 from which they normally suffer most. Today (Wed-nes day,1 st December) marked the first defeat for the\n1st and 2nd Xl's against Lanchester College. Fortunately both were \"friendlies\". The 1st defeat was due\nmore to a wrong frame of mind than a lack of ability\nand the 2nd XI fielded a much depleted team. Last\nSaturday marked the embarkation on the annual U.L. cup competitions. The 1st XI, 4th XI and 5th XI having\ntough games against Kings I,L.S.E. Ill and Chelsea II\nrespectively. However, with a bit of luck, we hope to\nsee 7 l.C. teams in the draw on Monday. Any supporters would be welcome as we would like to see a repeat of last year's feat of winning all three cup com-petitions.\nI. C.W. A. Hockey l.C. Ladies played in the 1st round of the U.L. U. cup\nat Kings ground on a very cold, misty Wednesday after-noon. In this, our first match with two umpires, we\nfound Kings to be an excellent team and the pressure\nwas soon on. Both teams began shakily in defence,\nbut this was no detraction from the hard-working forwards who made many good moves. Chris Culshaw\ntook the ball on the left wing mid way through the 1st half moved into and then across the circle and finally\npushed the ball past the G. K. for our 1st goal.\nDuring the second half, the same gruelling pattern of\nplay continued until Chris Culshaw managed to get our\nsecond goal, almost putting their G. K. in the net at well.\nWe managed to hold on to this 2-0 lead and so go\nthrough to the next round of the Cup.\nWednesday, the 10th November was a very sad\nday for the Badminton\nClub. This marked the defeat of the Men'sI team by\nNorthern Poly 6-3, their\nfirst defeat in over two\nyears. It was all the more\nignominious since they\nhad beaten N.P.63 in the\nU.L. U. Cup in the previous\nweek, and then went on to\nbeat them in the return\nleague match 7-2. They\nalso thrashed Oxford University II 17-2 (with a little\nhelp from the ladies!) and\nbeat U.C.81 to reach the\nsemi-finals of the U.L. U. cup.\nThe Men's II team is already well on the way to\nthe 2nd division title, comprehensively winning their\nfirst six games. A glance\nat the table would lead\none to believe the 1st and\n2nd teams should inter-change; unfortunately, the\ncaptain does not agree.\nThe 3rd and 4th teams\nare suffering through lack\nof fixtures, and, after a shaky start, have recovered and should be\nwell placed in their divisions by the end of the\nseason. The ladies have\nalso had a rather erratic\nstart, but they are at least\nmanaging to field full\nteams, always a problem\nfor them.\nOn the whole then we've\nshown that the badminton\nat l.C. is of exceptionally\nhigh standard and we intend to prove it by beating\nboth Oxford and Cambridge 1st teams next\nterm. S. Sanderson\nVice-Capt.\nRugby\nAnd now for a report on\nthe backbone of the l.C. Rugby Club, the AT s or\nas it has been in recent\nweeks the 'A' team. These\nare the people who turn up\neach week to find themselves drawn upon by the\nEx. 1st and generally re-shuffled, but it says much\nfor the spirit of the players\nin that this term we have\nplayed with an ever-varying side and yet have\nstill been quite successful.\nIn recent weeks we have\nhad good wins against\nSt. Albans and Southall\nTech., the first of these\nvictories being a good\nexample of continual hard\nwork by the forwards,\ncapitalised on by the\nbacks. And then there was\nLondon Welsh. Andy Gozeisiak played well in this\ngame, as referee, but I began to doubt his mathematical ability (maybe I'm biased).\nThe A1's consist of the\nfresher s adjusting themselves to club rugby, probably poised for honours in\nthe Ex. 1st and 1st teams\nin future seasons, and they\nare held together by the\nold lags who just enjoy the\ngame.\nThe half-back combination of Mike Agg and Noel\nStack never ceases to\namaze at its effectiveness.\nNick Tomlinson has carved\nhis niche at full-back and\nEditorial\nAgain, yesterday, it was hoped that all sports fixtures\nwould be cancelled in order to support the National Day\nof Action. It will come as a relief to most club captains\nand fixtures secretaries to hear that this is to be the last\nblanket cancellation. With a bad winter being forecast\nby the long range weathermen, clubs having good runs\nin the cup and league will need every available date in\nwhich to complete their fixture list.\nResults so far have been encouraging, with the possible exception of the Rugby 1st XV. Their rugby has\nbeen unable to match their dashing writing for FELIX,\nalthough most of the games they have lost, have been\nby a narrow margin. This does not encourage their\nsupporters in their bid to regain the Gutteridge Cup for\nwhich the first round was played last week, when l.C. were victorious.\nThe arrogance and complacency of the Badminton\nClub could well have been a cause of the Mens I team\nsuffering its first defeat for more than two seasons \u2014\nperhaps George can now take off the black arm band\nhe has been wearing.\nThe Football Club as a whole has started remarkably\nwell, and it is to be hoped that this continues in their\nbid to retain the various cups. Supporters will be very\nwelcome at Harlington to give encouragement in the\nexpected long run cup. The Rugby Club can attract\na reasonable crowd but the Football Club seems unable to match this.\nThe Boat Club are to be congratulated in fielding\neight crews in the Winter Vlll's Cup in which the top\nopen division was won by the l.C.1 st VIII.\nThe Ladies Hockey after a tough match succeeded\nin getting into the 2nd round draw of the cup.\nplace-kicker, while Rich\nLester has proved to be a powerful winger as has\nPaul McCartney.

The purpose of this\narticle is to outline some of the basic concepts of Hi-Fi\nand to present the reader with a guide to currently\navailable sound systems for domestic use.\nOne of the commonest fallacies lies in the syn omo nous use of the Hi-Fi and stereo. Stereo refers to sound\nwhich does not originate from a point source and is\nmost commonly implemented with two loudspeaker\nenclosures or headphones. Hi-Fidelity in its strict\ndefinition refers to exact reproduction of the original\nsound. No system at present available can truly claim\nto meet this specification but many do come very close\nto it and it is these which represent the 'Hi-Fi' category of today.\nAt present three different subdivisions exist in the\nHi-Fi category mono (single source) Stereo (source\ndistributed in one vertical place usually using two\nloudspeakers), Quadrophonic (source distributed in\ntwo vertical planes usually using four loudspeakers).\nThe idea of quad ro phony is a relatively new one and\nat present no universal standard has been agreed on its\nimplementation so I feel it is unwise to buy a quad ro phonic system at present. Stereo on the other hand is\nstandardized and probably gives the best results from\nrecords, tapes and radio presently available. For this\nreason the rest of this article will be concerned with\nHi-Fidelity domestic stereo systems, and suggestions\nfor possible systems.\nThree different sources of programme material exist,\ndiscs, tapes and radios and of these the commonest\nis discs or records. When deciding on what to buy in\nthe way of Hi-Fi equipment two decisions are necessary, the first is how much money you are going to\nspend and the second is which out of these sources\nof sound will be purchased initially and which combination will be eventually reached.\nOnce this step has been taken you can start thinking\nabout which pieces of equipment are best suited to\nyour needs. For most people unit audio (i.e. separate\nspeakers, record deck, amplifier, etc.) is the obvious\n| A CHRISTMAS GIFT %\n\u00a7 FOR ALL THE YEAR ROUND \u00ab\nY.

When buying this you need to take into account\nwhat inputs you will require, e.g. tape deck, record\ndeck, tuner, what size room you are likely to use it\nin, what outputs you require speakers and/or head-phones, and the flexibility of the controls in the amp li fier. Assuming you want all common inputs enough\npower to fill an average size room and a reasonable\nsound from the amplifier you will have to invest a minimum of about \u00a320 in an amplifier. Suggestions for\npossible systems will be given at the end of this article.\nOne essential point that must be emphasized is the\nold Hi-Fi clich e 'that a system is only as good as its\nweakest link'. At present this is usually the loudspeakers\nor the programme source.\nMost people require a method of reproducing records\nin their systems as this is the most commonly available\nuser selectable programme source. This need is met by\na record deck or transcription turntable. Such an item\nmust have the following properties, constant speed of\nrotation of the disc, the ability to track (or follow the\nrecord groove) accurately, and must do as little damage\nto the record as possible. You can either buy a complete\nunit consisting of turntable and pickup or you can purchase the two separately; in my opinion there is little\nto choose between either method except for very expensive systems when one is forced to do the latter.\nIn order to fulfil the above needs a minimum of \u00a315 is\nneeded for a mounted record deck, some money can be\nsaved by making your own cabinet. A cartridge is\nnext link in the chain and this must have the ability to\nreproduce the whole audio spectrum approximately\nlinearly and track properly at as low a mass as possible\nto reduce record wear. Here a minimum of \u00a35 expenditure is necessary.\nLoudspeakers are probably the biggest source of\ncontroversy at present in the Hi-Fi field. They range from\nsmall sealed bookshelf enclosures which rely on linearity in the drive unit, to complicated reflex enclosures\nwhich counter act this deficiency. The smaller units\ntend to have a poor low frequency or bass response,\nand the bigger units are difficult to house in a flat or\ndigs. So you pay your money and you take your choice,\nprobably a minimum of \u00a320 for a reasonable sound and\npreferably a bit more.\nTape recorders are becoming increasingly popular\nand have the advantages that once recorded the sound\nis less likely to deteriorate with age and longer spells of\nmusic are possible without having to change the record-ing. Their main disadvantage is that a recording is not\nso easy to select from a tape as it is from records. They\nalso have the disadvantage of costing over \u00a350 for a good quality stereo model.\nNow that the BBC have decided to provide us with\nstereo broadcasts these are probably the cheapest if\nnot most convenient due to lack of choice, form of programme material. A good stereo tuner costs about \u00a325\nand no further expenditure apart from a good aerial is\nneeded.\nUp till now I have deliberately avoided technical terms\nbut now I will give a brief summary of some of the more\ncommon terms, their causes and reasonable figures\nexpected for them in Hi-Fi equipment.\nNoise is a random hiss sound caused by a bad connection and poor quality components in the amplifier,\nthis is most common in transistor i zed equipment and\namplifiers should have a figure of \u2014 50db or less. Hum\nis caused by pickup of stray mains signals usually on\nthe record or tape deck or amplifier and it would be\nabout\u201450db or less. Excessive hum can be caused by\nmultiple earth paths between different pieces of equipment and this can be eliminated by providing a single\nearth connection between each piece of equipment and\nthe amplifier.\nWow and flutter describe slow and fast speed changes\nin the record deck or tape deck respectively, this proves\nvery annoying whilst listening and should be less than\n0.5%,.\nCross talk is the degree of mixing of the left and right\nhand channels by the system usually present in cartridges and amplifiers, it decreases the effective separation of a stereo signal and should do better than 30db. Frequency response is self explanatory and should\nbe equivalent to that of the listener about 3HZ17 KHZ. A better frequency response that this is the amplifier\ndecreases some types of distortion.\nDistortion is the degree of imperfection in reproduction introduced between the input and output of say an\namplifier, it should be less than 0.05%. One point of\nwarning here, different manufacturers quote different\nstandards and some types of distortion are more unpleasant than others, the best form of judgement is the\nhuman ear.\nThe best approach to buying a system is as follows :\ni) Decide how much money you can afford. Hi-Fi\nobeys the law of decreasing returns, really good\nquality equipment costs a fortune.\nii) Listen to as many people's equipment as possible.\niii) Read a few issues of Hi-Fi News, Hi-Fi Sound or\nPopular Hi-Fi.\niv) Draw up several possible combinations of equip-ment. There now follows some suggestions for\npossible components for a system which from experience I can recommend categorized as Low,\nMedium and High priced. I must emphasise that\ndifferent people have different ideas and it is up to\nyou to make the final choice, but I hope a few suggestions will be useful. The prices quoted are\napproximate.\nRECORD DECKS Low Medium High\nBSR MP60 ( \u00a3 1 2 ) Goldring Lenco (turntable only)\nGarrard SP25 ( \u00a3 1 2 ) G169 ( \u00a3 2 4 ) Thorens TD150\nConnoisseur BD1 Goldring Lenco ( \u00a3 4 0 )\nKit ( \u00a3 1 1 ) G175 ( \u00a3 3 0 ) Thorens TD125\nGarrard AP76 G175 ( \u00a3 3 0 )\n( \u00a3 6 5 )\n( \u00a3 2 0 ) Garrard 401\n( \u00a3 2 0 )\n( \u00a3 3 0 )\nGoldring G99\n( \u00a3 2 3 )\nPossible pick up arms for the high priced turntables are:\nGoldring Lenco L75 ( \u00a3 1 1 )\nNeat G30 ( \u00a3 1 2 )\nAudio Technika AT1005 ( \u00a3 1 7 )\nS ME Series II ( \u00a3 2 6 - \u00a3 3 0 )\nCartridges (all Stereo\nLow\n)\nMedium High\nDecca Deram\n( \u00a3 4 )\nGoldring CS90\n( \u00a3 4 )\nAudio Technika\nAT66 ( \u00a3 5 )\nGoldring G800\n( \u00a3 7 - \u00a3 1 2 )\nAudio Technika\nAT21 ( \u00a3 7 - \u00a3 1 3 )\nShure M44E ( \u00a3 9 )\nShure V15 ( \u00a3 3 0 )\nAudio Technika\nAT35 ( \u00a3 2 0 )\nAmplifiers (all Stereo\nLow\n)\nMedium High\nTeleton GA101\n( \u00a3 2 5 )\nTeleton SAQ206\n( \u00a3 2 0 )\nHeathkit ( \u00a3 2 0 )\nCambridge P50\n( \u00a3 8 0 )\nLeak 70 ( \u00a3 6 0 )\nRogers Ravensbrook ( \u00a3 4 0 )\nSugden Class A( \u00a3 5 0 )\nArmstrong 521\n( \u00a3 4 5 )\nCambridge P100\n( \u00a3 1 2 0 )\nQuad ( \u00a3 1 0 0 )\nLoudspeakers (prices\nLow\nare for a pair)\nMedium High\nKef Crestar ( \u00a3 3 8 )\nGodman Maxims\n( \u00a3 3 3 )\nWharfedale\nDentons ( \u00a3 3 2 )\nKef Concorde\n( \u00a3 7 0 )\nGoodman\nMagnums ( \u00a3 6 5 )\nWharfedale\nDovedale ( \u00a3 6 5 )\nKef Concerto\n( \u00a3 8 5 )\nLeak Sandwich\n600 ( \u00a3 8 0 )\nCambridge Audio\nR50 ( \u00a3 1 7 0 )\nTape recorders (make given only, as model numbers differ for\nnumber of tracks).\nLow Medium High\nAkai ( \u00a3 6 0 ) Tandberg ( \u00a3 9 0 ) Revox ( \u00a3 2 5 0 )\nFernograph ( \u00a3 3 0 0 )\nThe last two categories of tunes and headphones I know little about. Koss and AKG are probably the best\nheadphones and the tuner made by the same makes as\nyour amplifier is probably best.\nIn choosing a system items from the same price range\nonly should be matched, to get the best value for money\nremember the chain is only as good as its weakest link.\nBefore you part with your money go to a reputable\ndealer and listen to orchestral music, violins and organs\nshow up the limitations of a system. It is often wise to\nbuy a record and take it with you to be played as most\ndealers only have demonstration records like Herb\nAlpert which sound good on all systems.\nListen to the system at low volume, noise distortion\nand hum are easier to detect at low volume.\nWhen you have your system, experiment with speaker\npositions in the room to get the best effect, if they are\ntoo close together the stereo effect is less and if too\nfar apart they give a loss of central sound referred to\nas hole in the middle effect.\nIf you buy a record deck spend some money on a decent storage system, records should be stored ver-tic ally. With the price of recorded music care of the\nrecords is essential and the Waths range of cleaners\nthe dust bag, preen er and para stat, are the best way to\nremove dust and static from records; beware of some\ncleaning cloths which leave more muck in the grooves\nthan they remove.\nFinally, I would like to add the warning that you will\nnever be satisfied with your equipment. As time passes,\nbetter equipment will be available and there will also be\nthe nagging suspicion that other peoples Hi-Fi sounds\nbetter than yours. When this happens you will become\na Hi-Fi fanatic and keep improving your system until\nyour bank manager clamps down on the overdraft. You\nhave been warned.\n\n"

The concert at the Lyceum last week could well\nhave lost around \u00a3300 due to its bad attendance and\nthis is no isolated example of IC failing in its efforts\nto raise money for charity. Every year, we make a very\nsmall amount for our Carnival in proportion to the size\nof our college and every year the blame immediately\nfalls on the shoulders of the rag committee. The question is, are they really deserving of the blame?\nIt is perhaps true to say that the members of the\nrag committee are a little inexperienced and perhaps\nsome of their ideas have lacked the organisational brilliance they might have had, or perhaps they have just\nlacked the brilliance. Whatever one thinks of the efforts\nof the rag committee, it cannot be denied that they are\nfacing a major problem. IC apathy in its crudest form.\nA concert such as the one at the Lyceum last week was\ngood value at 60p, even if the profits had been lining\nthe pockets of some gro tty company, but they weren't. They were going to charity to help people in need and\nit wouldn't have hurt anyone just to give 60p and get\nnothing in return. You were offered entertainment for\nyour money and most of you still failed to go. So what\nchance do our rag committee have in future if this is\nthe kind of response it gets at present.\nDon't criticise the rag committee, don't even eat your\nmeals with an easy conscience until you personally\nhave done something to help Carnival.

Tizard 434.\nREADERS WRITE..\nPRESSING OUT THE JUICE\nFair\nSex?\nSir,\n'Regularly our telephone rings\nand it is a journalist from a newspaper or magazine who has\nsuddenly made the epoch-mak-ing discovery that in this country there is an unprecedented\ninterest in wine and wine-making\nand they are bursting with\neagerness to write an article or\nfeature about it.\"\nThis was the opening sentence of the editorial of the\nOctober issue of 'Winemaker'\nmagazine, and like all the best\nnational dailies and glossy\nmagazines, FELIX is no ex c ep tion. Also, like all the other\nsuch accounts that I have read,\nthe Felix edition had its short-comings.\nThe author did however speak\nfrom experience and emphasised points as the time required,\nsimplicity and the possible problems arising. I intend to try to\ncorrect notions spoiling an\notherwise readable article. At\nthe same time I will avoid including any superfluous technical detail.\nEquipment wise, I will point\nout that most metals will dissolve in the must and give rise\nto a horrible 'tinny' flavour.\nWhilst enamel is safe in itself\nit could be disastrous if scratched or dented and I would recommend the use of a plastic\nbucket.\nThe ingredients play the most\nimportant part in determining the\ntype and quality of the finished\nwine. Most certainly mouldy\nfruits should be discarded, although there is a group of winemakers who delight in using odd\ningredients.\nEach type of ingredient has a method of treatment which best\nsuits it. Vegetables are best\nboiled, as described in the ar-tic le, but the fragrant oils present in flowers would be dissipated if boiling water were poured over them. It would be better\nif 2-4 pints of the flowers were\nsoaked in COLD water for 2-4\ndays.\nShort of pressing out the\njuice, most fruits should be\ntreated in this way, but it would\nbenefit from about 7 days on\nthe pulp. All fruits and vegetables should be chopped into\nsmaller pieces before pro ces sing.\nI should add that the yeast\nand sugar should be added at\nthis stage in order that the yeast\nhas as much time as possible\nto breed.\nThere are many different\nyeasts and they all have different effects. The most common\nEnglish wild yeast is only capable of fermenting up to 4%.\nalcohol by volume. Bakers yeast\nis not the strongest and brewers\nyeast imparts a' beer y' flavour\nto the wine and since a wine\nyeast can be bought just as\neasily, it makes sense to use it.\nVirtually all the alcohol present in a home-made wine is\nproduced from the sugar added.\nHowever, yeast produces alcohol\nmore and more slowly as the\nalcohol content increases until\nit finally stops when the yeast\nhas reached its 'alcohol to ler ance.' All the remaining sugar\njust makes the wine sweeter. In\nfact 2 lbs. sugar per gallon will\ngive a dry wine of about 12%\nalcohol and 3 lbs. sugar per\ngallon will give about 19%\nalcohol which is about the\nmaximum you can expect under\nnormal conditions. Hence 4 lbs.\nsugar per gallon should produce\na sweet wine. Any subsequent\nsugar additions would start slow\nfermentation, but this would not\nincrease the alcohol content\nappreciably.\nLast is the most interesting\npart of a wine and that brings\nme back to ingredients. The\ntaste is a balance of flavour;\nbouquet, alcohol, sugar, acids\nand tannin. Sufficient acids prevent the wine from tasting in-sip id. If the other ingredients in\na recipe lack sufficient acids,\nthese may be included as chemical additives. This might put a beginner off the recipe, but I should not shy from such recipes once you have gained a little experience, in fact they\nshould produce a well balanced\nwine. The presence of sufficient\nacid also prevents the growth\nof hostile bacteria but does not\nharm the yeast.\nIf your wine doesn't taste a little unpleasant immediately\nafter it has finished fermenting\n\u2014there is something wrong.\nHowever, after about 6 months,\nit should taste palatable and will\nusually continue to improve for\nat least 3 years. Red wines and\nvegetable wines will take correspondingly longer to mature\nand could be avoided by the\nbeginner.\nI would like to finish by making two remarks. Firstly, if the\npreceding discussion interested\nyou, the book 'Progressive Winemaking' by Peter Duncan and\nBryan Acton (75p) furthers the\nsubject. If I have frightened you\nfrom starting then the books\n'Making Wines Like Those You\nBuy' (30p) by the same authors\nor 'Recipes for Prize-Winning\nWines' (30p) by Bryan Acton\ncontain recipes designed with\nall the above points in mind. All\nthree books are published by\nthe 'Amateur Winemaker'.\nSecondly, discreet enquiries\nabout the recipe for 'loader n berry' wine show that it is a trade secret but rumour has it\nthat its principal ingredient is\n\u2014wait for it\u2014'BLAE-berries.'\nYours,\nIAN D. FERGUSON\nWe are glad to have avoided\nany superfluous technical de-tail. This letter reached us 1500\nwords long with no less than\n247 spelling mistakes.\u2014Ed.\nLunchtime 0s Dear\nDear Sir,\nSurely it is time to put an end\nto this stupid and childish practice of stringing together a lot of\n'Lunchtime' names to make a so-called joke.\nYours at length,\nJoe-Cah iI l th e Pig-Lets-Have-Fun-Baby-Face-My-Life's Workers Playtimes-LeaderColumn-ln che s Thick-Fog-Onthe-Tyne-For-a Ding-Dong-Beil-Tower-Piers-Corbyn.\nDear Editor,\nI noted with interest the apparent surprise with which\n'Felicity' commented that very\nfew women had participated in\nthe march on Wednesday last.\nTwo points had perhaps escaped the writer's notice.\nThe first of these concerns the\nl.C. Union meeting at which\nI.C.U. rejected a motion to allow\nwomen into the Union Bar during all opening hours.\nThe second point concerns\nthe following Union meeting at\nwhich the question of action\nagainst the D.E.S. Green Paper\nwas first raised. One criticism\nof the proposed Government\naction was that it unfairly punished all Student Unions for the\nundemocratic action of one or\ntwo in withholding funds from\ncertain po licit al clubs, the\nspeakers concerned pointing out\nthat the vast majority of Students Unions, including I.C.U. did not discriminate against any\ngroups of people with regard to\nFunds or Facilities.\nI fail to see how the women\nof Imperial College can be expected to participate in action\nto perpetuate their 'demo cr a tic' Students Union in its present form, when they are excluded from what should be a focal point of its facilities, except on Sundays. I should have\nliked to raise this point at the\nsecond of these Union meetings,\nbut due to lack of time, only a very limited number of people\nwere allowed to speak.\nYours faithfully,\nGILLIAN BOND,\nMat. Sci. II\nSir,\nHaving read the anonymous\neditorial (can you find more than\n'Tony'?) in the current issue of\nRCS Broadsheet I wonder whether the time has arrived to\nhalt the constant, childish and\npetty contentions between the\nvarious Union publications.\nHowever, I would also take this\nopportunity to explain the present circulation policy of\nFELIX.\nThis term, in addition to providing FELIX FREE, our print\norder has been increased from\nits previous minimum of 1,200 to\na new, constant level of 2,000. I note, with pride, the rapid disappearance of these 2,000 following distribution.\nAt the beginning of term we\ndecided to circulate FELIX to\nevery student-house and hall\nresident. This has now been\nestablished as an advertising\ncommitment. The remaining 900\ncopies are distributed throughout college, approximately 100\nbeing left on each of the department stands (according to\ndepartmental size). Thus one\nissue is available for every two\nmembers of the student pop ul a tion.\nIn closing I would like to\nagree with the comment in\nRCSB, regarding . . . APATHY.\nThe 'select band of FELIX' always requires more f eli citations for all its diverse activities.\nHow about you?\nJOHN B. STARES\nWHAT! CN DECEMBER\nThur 9\n12.30 pm Room 303 Mines. I.C.

He feels that negotiation is ess ent i al, and that there should be some form of accountability. Asked as to\nwhether the grant for unions should come from The UGC and if so, whether it should be earmarked for union purposes, he thought that in the long run it would\nbe better not to be, as it could be subjected to a 'cut too easily.,' Ernie Roberts gave atypical trade unionist speech, going on more about TU\nautonomy than SUs. He said that we faced the same fight as the trade unions,\ni.e. that of \"contracting=in\". Promising union support for us, he said \"Your\nfight is our fight and our fight is yours\". \"We must fight against the government on every front\". Then it was Digby's turn - he proceeded to recite the usual NUS doctrine and\nspeech. He said that today's national\u2022show of strength was the greatest by\nunions for four or five years.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX Thursday, 9th December, 1971\nPresenting \u2022 \u2022\nA WOMAN It's probably true to say that\nChristmas in the city is consumer society's answer to the\nChristian miracle. But salesmanship or not, it gives London,\nn articular ly the West End. an atmosphere that would be ignored\nat any other time of the year.\nThis year, for example, Regent\nStreet shows the traditional 12\ndays of Christmas in traditional\n60-watt coloured bulbs. And the\nseason is still a merry one even\nif Santa Claus is fibre-glass and\nthe trees, crepe paper.\nThe West End\nIf you are in Oxford Street,\nthen visit Selfridges. For as their\nown Uncle Holly will tell you,\nthey have everything. From the\nred fountains in the Fourth floor\nrestaurant to the basement, the\nshop is packed with what is\neuphemistically called 'gift suggestions', both clich ed and new.\nI thought the stainless steel\nmugs and plates were some of\nthe most elegant I'd seen,\nthough then again this range of\ngoods was not cheap. Avoid the\nmen's clothes department\nthough, you will probably find a better bargain at C and A's. Hamley's, in Regent Street, is\nLondon's biggest Toy Shop.\nLike those at Selfridges' toy de-partment, no assistant ever\nstands idle but sits continually\ndemonstrating the new lines.\nAnd take a hundred lines if you\nthought toys were solely for children. A new drawing gadget\n(perhaps they should have\ncalled it 'Son of Spirograph')\nproduces complex coloured patterns that would put some art\nto shame. And if you want a room to look really different, try\none of Waddington's 'Safari\nHeads', a kit that looks really\neffective when assembled.\nHammersmith and the Bush\nShepherd's Bush Market (by\nthe Metropolitan Line Station) is\none of the most amazing places\nto visit in the gloom of a late\nSaturday afternoon. Stall-holders\nstand with hands in overcoat\npockets under signs that offer\n'London's biggest bargains'.\nWhile the real crowd pullers\nthrow 24-piece bone china tea\nsets in the air or squirt inexpensive Cologne on the wrists of the\nunsuspecting public.\nThis is the place for Christmas\ngifts, which aren't too pricey.\nMotor accessories are always a safe bet, and a few stalls provide genuine bargains, but look\naround first. Here is a good\nplace to go if you've been\nconned into buying a tree or\nholly, but be prepared to face\nembarrassment on the bus\nhome.\nHammersmith itself has a fairly average shopping centre\n(big stores and a large number\nof shoe shops in King Street).\nBut for something unusual have\na look in the enormous 'Junk\nCity' in the Broadway. Not\neverything is junk, and not\neverything is antique either,\nthough there were a couple of\nnicely ageing prints in, the last\ntime I looked.\nAround South Kensington\nBeauchamp Place, just off\nBrompton Road, has now become one of the most fashionable shopping centres for antiques and art nouveau.\nBoadicea, which claims to be\nthe 'British Shop', I found to be\nthe most interesting place for\ngifts. They sell pottery, prints,\njewellery, glass, cloths, cera-mic s, and in general all manner\nof really original modern gifts \u2014\nmany both decorative and functional. One of the most refreshing things about this shop is\nthat everything is priced legibly\nand unashamedly \u2014 and their\nprices are extremely reasonable.\nWell worth a visit.\nHarness, in Harrington Road\n(down near South Ken tube)\n19, Beauchamp Place,\nSW3\n* * *\nBritish-Made\nPresents\nModern Jewellery,\nCrafts\nOriginal Prints\n* * *\nOpen 10\u20145.30 daily\nincluding Sundays\nmust be almost unique in London, as it sells almost exclusively hand-crafted leather bags\nand belts\u2014priced from \u00a34 to \u00a36\nfor the former, from \u00a31.35 for\nthe latter. They also make a special line in canvas bags,\nideal for carrying books and\nthings around in, which you\nmight like to buy yourself. And\nfor Christmas you might like\nsome of their brightly-coloured\nspecial candles. Harness is\neven better value since they will\ngive you a10 per cent discount\nagainst your S.U. card.\nIf you don't find anything\nthat pleases in these places,\nthen you won't find what you're\nlooking for in Woolworth's either.\nBarnes*\n23 Harrington Rd., S.W.7.

He would require reasonable (?) qu or a for UGM's and\nreferenda, ensure election of Union officers by secret ballot and\nstrengthen Union constitutions, thus ensuring student participation\nwithin the Unions.\n2. By ensuring a reasonable level of participation in Union\nGovernment, the responsibility of those taking decisions for the student body as a whole for their decisions would be ensured. A registrar would allow provision for mass meetings and where there was\na conflict between the Council and the mass meeting, referenda\nwould decide which was the more representative.\n3. A Registrar would guarantee income from the LEA's or UGC\nand thus ensure Union independence from College Authorities. The\ndevelopment in Union business would be aided by the reduction of\nthe interference from UGM! I4. A Registrar would act as a students'. Ombudsman complaints\nof internal Union unconstitutional action. A Registrar would be\nempowered to penal is e financially any Union acting un constitution ally. Decisions of the Registrar in such matters would be liable to\nappeal to a reviewing committee in which students would sit.\nConsidering these 4 points made we can immediately pick out\nfallacies and illusions showing that a Registrar is to be feared as\nmuch as, if not more than, the split level of financing specifically\nsuggested in the Green Paper:\u2014\n1. What might be a reasonable quorum \u201425 per cent? i.e.1,000 for IC. The 'provisions for mass meetings is allowed' in (2) suggests these should be few and far between \u2014 does this really involve greater participation in Union Government \u2014 especially when\nthe Union decision must be the same as the Council decision \u2014\nsurely there is no conflict \u2014 either the UGM is quo rate \u2014 in which\ncase it must be the supreme body or else it is in quo rate and the\ncouncil decision stands. Even with a Registrar people still will not\ncome to Union meetings, either because of lack of time or interest,\nconsidering the topics for discussion.\n2. Less UGM participation would put a greater burden on to\nthe shoulders of a few Union officers and could lead to one man\ncontrol of Student Unions (presuming any control is left after the\nRegistrar has taken his).\n3. Unions may lose College interference \u2014 but only because\nthe Government is totally manipulating the Union. How do in-quo rate UGM's interfere \u2014 they can only be used for advice at the\nmoment \u2014 what harm is there in that?\n4. Who decides the un constitutionality? \u2014the Registrar. Who\ndecides the fine (guaranteed income?)?\u2014the Registrar. The\nRegistrar will totally control Union finance under these proposals\n(and the Government's Registrar could be worse than that of the\nFCS) \u2014 it will no longer be a case of Student Unions but Government institutions (despite the noble appeal committee with actual\nstudent representation \u2014 cor!)\nKEEP FIGHTING THE GREEN PAPER \u2014 there is always lots of\nnew information from the Union Office \u2014 DISCUSS AT HOME\nOVER CHRISTMAS \u2014 GET YOUR M.P.'s SUPPORT \u2014 GET YOUR\nPARENTS' SUPPORT \u2014 BE READY FOR THE REGISTRAR \u2014\nStudent Unions should be run by Students \u2014 with a Registrar could\nwe ever fight our Accommodation Campaign or any other pressure\non the Government Campaign \u2014 could Felix ever discuss politics\nor criticise any Government policy? \u2014\nNO TO THE GREEN PAPER\nNO TO THE REGISTRAR\nNO TO VOLUNTARY MEMBERSHIP\nSupport these three principles.\n\n"

After all, this\nlocation has been associated with C and G union\nmeetings for some time,\nthese being on a considerably lighter note! However, for once, there were\nsome important items on\nthe agenda and Dave\nAmos could be excused\nfor his annoyance at the\npeople who were throwing\nvarious objects (chalk and\npaper darts) in his general direction. Once or\ntwice, though, he sounded\nremarkably like a crotchety\nold school teacher trying\nto keep her class under\ncontrol.\nCommunity Action\nEventually business ground to a start after\nseveral attempts, with the\nfirst item being that of a proposed new constitution\nfor the Community Action\ngroup. This is a very worthwhile project but the main\naims seemed to get lost\nin the mass of argument\nas to whether the group\nshould be a sub-committee\nof a sub-committee or a sub-committee of ICU\ncouncil. The general points\nwere that:\u2014\n(i) There should be a committee of eleven;\n(ii) The chairman should be elected at the\nICU general meeting in\nSpring;\n(iii) Two ordinary members of ICU should be\nelected annually;\n(iv) The committee reports directly to the ICU\ncouncil.\nThis and the necessary\namendments to ICU byelaws was passed by a large majority.\nDiscipline\nAs was mentioned at the\nmeeting, this document is\na compromise, but it appears as though it may\nwork. There is some room\nfor doubt, however, in\nparagraph 17 which implies that prosecution in\nan outside court may result in further punishment\nby the Discipline/Disciplinary Appeals committee (a copy of the whole paper\ncan be obtained at\nUnion Office).\nThe document was\nfinally approved but not by\na very large majority. This\ncould either have been due\nto lack of support or lack\nof understanding which is\nmuch more likely. After all,\nwhat chance is there of\nbeing able to absorb a fairly complex document in\nfive minutes? Again that\nfeeling of 'fait ac comp li' hangs in the air.\nNUS Conference\nThe little red sheet said:\nThis is your opportunity\nto question and criticise\nthe delegates on their ac-t ions.' Most people seemed more concerned\nwith how Piers Corbyn\nmanaged to get himself\ncalled 'the President of\nICU' in the Daily Telegraph. His somewhat noncommittal answer to this,\n'Their ,files must be out\nof date' raised a few\nlaughs. In fact, he spoke at\nthe conference on Unemployment and Union Autonomy and it would have\nbeen much more interesting to hear about what he\nsaid in the name of Imperial College students!\nFor more details see the\narticle on NUS Conference.\nUnion Autonomy\nThis was the last and\nmost complicated item to\nbe discussed. In brief,\nthere was the two separate\nmotions to be discussed,\nboth saying what should\nhappen on December 8th. One was written by ICU\nExecutive and the other\n(printed in red) by, guess\nwho, Piers Corbyn!\nPiers' motion was much\nmore militant and in direct\nconflict with the NUS\nruling on the subject, in\nthat he advocated the enforcing of the boycott\nplanned on lectures and\nthe occupation of college block on Wednesday\nafternoon.\nEventually, after much\nconfusion, a mixture of the\ntwo motions was passed\nwith the much more levelheaded executive motion\nmaking up the bulk. The\nmain points being:\n(i) Public statement by\nthe Rector against the\nGreen Paper.\n(ii) Full support for\nNUS motion.\n(iii) Boycott of lectures\nand laboratories on December 8th, with picket\nlines to encourage sup-port.\nBureaucracy Triumphs\nAgain\nI know that some formal\ndebating rules must be\nretained, but surely something could be done about\nthe mass of petty restrictions which bog down\nevery Union meeting?\n(Please).\nUS KEnts. Concert WISHBONE SMASH\nWhat a pampered life a Felix writer\nleads to be sure! All these concerts to be\nreviewed, and all of them free. Actually\nthe USK Rag Concert at the Lyceum was\nthe first to which my admission price as\na Felix rep. was, shall we say, slightly\nreduced. Otherwise I should not have\ncome at all because having seen Wishbone Ash three weeks previously when\nthey were made to look sterile and amateurish by Mountain, I was reluctant to\npay to subject myself to further agony.\nYou may then gather that I was preparing to write a thoroughly damning review\nof this concert, accusing the group of\nbeing Britain's Grand Funk Railroad, repeating riffs ad nausea m, and only\nmaking it due to the perverse enthusiasms\nof certain influential rock writers, just to\nshow everyone who thinks I can only\nwrite good reviews that I can write bad\nones occasionally. To my incalculable\ndisappointment I quite enjoyed them. It\nmight be that the group plays better in\na smaller venue, perhaps, or that they\nplay better when not playing second\nfiddle to the world's greatest rock band\n(just an opinion) or just that that was\na bad gig and this was a good one. Whatever the reason, I'm afraid it's another\npatronising \"Yes\u2014but\" review, folks, but\njust wait and see, one of these days I 'll\nget my hands on something really lousy.\nThe show was opened by Philip Goodhand-Tait who played some nice, wistful\nsongs; he really is like Elton John; I know that has been said hundreds of\ntimes before, and I wish I could say\nsomething else, but as far as I can see\nthe only difference was that GoodhandTait didn't take his trousers off and play\nrock 'n roll. He was just nice, that's all.\nRenaissance followed, and they were\nsurprisingly good. It might be surprising\nto some that such a little-known group\nhas such an original sound, but this group,\nwith the amplified piano which really\nsounded like a grand and not more like\na Jamaican steel band, and those soaring\nvocal harmonies, can make that claim.\nThey don't just play \"poof ter\" music,\nthough, and for the last two numbers,\nwhen at one time all the members of the\ngroup picked up some sort of percussion\ninstrument and the guitarist was given\nsome space, they really got it on. The\ndrummer looks and plays like Ginger\nBaker, too, which should add to their\nmass appeal. Some people even clapped\nalong with the music, although it seemed\nthat the majority were too busy swigging\nbeer to pay much attention. The interested\nfew did call the group back for a well\ndeserved encore.\nWishbone Ash's act centred around\ntheir highly successful \"Pilgrimage\"\nalbum. They opened with two rockers,\n\"Vas Dis\" and \"Jailbait\", which got the\ncrowd adequately interested. Then followed the only bum song, \"The Pilgrim\",\nwhich was unbelievably rep it it io us, and\nmade me think that I might have been\nright the first time. This is a great pity,\nbecause the actual sound of the song\nis quite evocative of a jolly old Pilgrim\nsetting out, full of hope, on a bright sunny\nmorning (with a bit of imagination) and\nthe song could have been improved immeasurably with a bit of variety. \"Phoe-nix\" from the first album, has had that\ntreatment and for me was the highlight\nof the act, owing nothing to the current\n\"heavy rock\" format, brilliantly evocative\nagain and featuring Ted Turner on guitar.\nIt was long, too, about 20 minutes, and\n' not many groups can play for that long\nthese days without getting boring. With\na few more numbers like this, and less\nlike \"The Pilgrim\", Wishbone will justify\ntheir \"Brightest Hope\" rating with no\ntrouble at all. The audience, predictably,\nloved it, and by the penultimate number\n\"Where were you tomorrow\", the Lyceum\nwas a mass of gyrating bodies. This was\nguitarist Andy Powell's piece, and at one\nstage, after racing about the stage for\nseveral minutes, he leapt into the crowd.\nYes, I could almost say they were exciting\nand I hope more of their gigs are like\nthis than like the gig they played with\nMountain. I'm now inclined to believe\nthat one was the exception rather than\nthe rule.\nCompliments of the Season, record\nfans.\n\n"

    "content": "Page 8 FELIX Thursday, 9th December, 1971\nREVIEWS\nThere was an air of uncertainty in the audience at the\nbeginning of the stunning\n\"Godspell\" (Roundhouse)\nwhen I saw it. By the end,\nwhen the broken form of Jesus\nhas been carried round triumphantly from its crucifixion by\nhis disciples, our hands were\nraw with applause. The idea\nof a baby-faced, baggy-trouser ed Christ preaching to,\nand with a cast of eight clown-figures in a musical interpretation of St. Matthew's Gospel\ndoes not sound likely to be\nanything but garish and crude,\nbut it really does work. The\nparables and stories are performed in an extraordinary\nvariety of forms \u2014 ventriloquist's doll, goon voices, glove\nshow, tap dance, mime, charade and these fresh approaches combined with\nChrist's serious talk, force understanding on to the audi-en ce. The use of clowns is\nentirely validated, for the\nclown, with his humour, sadness and ultimate tragedy is a symbol of humanity, and it is\nthe humanity of Christ that is\nemphasised in the production.\nThe joy of the cast and audience is only occasionally overshadowed by a foretaste of\nthe Passion, such as when\nJohn the Baptist swings\nround on Christ with a question at a moment when Christ's arms are open. They stop.\nThink: Crucifixion.\nMany of the critics have\ncalled \" Godspell\" too sim pl is tic, but its simplicity arises\nout of the inherent lack of\ncomplication in the basic\nChristian Message. I cannot\nhope to convey my enthusiasm\nPLAYS for this challenging show with\nits sincere and joyous cast\n(David Essex is Christ, but\nthey are all very good) and\nfitting music. Go and behold.\nChalk Farm tube, turn right.\nThe Theatre of all Possibilities have now left London, but\nI think they are still worth a mention. This group of actors\nis a part of a community exploring the possibilities of\nBiotechnic Ecological communes in New Mexico and\nNew South Wales. Their acting is a part of this process\nfor their plays are about the\nmistake and the hope of civilised man. Their \"Faust\" uses\nthe legend's framework to\nshow the tragedy of Western\nCivilisation, though without\nMarguerite's heavenly choirs.\nThey seek to provide the\nanswer in the energetic \"Mc\nNeckels' Commune\", showing\na new institution in continual\nrevolt against itself. Fair\nenough. But the really interesting thing about these people\nis the acting style that they\nhave developed. This combines the classic Eastern approach of full use of the actor's body with normal Western\nrhetoric, and it's effect is a challenge to our sterilized Western Theatre.\nThere are really two plays\nin Peter Nicholl's \"The National Health\" (Old Vic). The\nmajor one follows the everyday\nlife of a Ward in a bleak Victorian hospital, complete with\nnurses, over-worked doctors,\ncondescending visitors and terrifying ly real patients. Wardlife is depicted exactly (so\nmy Medical Student sister tells\nme) as patients arrive, joke,\nsuffer, argue, play Monopoly,\nget potted and eventually leave\nvertically or horizontally.\nThe other play happens in\nepisodes, in the best traditions\nof the medical soap opera it\nparodies. Neil, a doctor (white)\nfalls in love with Nurse Norton\n(coloured), though his doctor-father (complete with Highlands accent) objects to their\nmarriage. Neil has to have a kidney transplant, Nurse Norton is the donor. Dad performs\nthe operation (\"Any nurse\ncould give him her heart, only\nNorton could give him a kid-ney\", lauds a Sister), relents,\nand everyone lives happily\never after.\nThe real success of the play\ncomes from the way in which\nfact and fantasy are inter-mingled. Jim Dale plays Barnet, the orderly, who fills the\nreal world with affected heartiness and provides the avid\ncommentary on the celluloid\nNorton affair. Occasionally he\neven steps out of the play, like\nthe Common Man in \" A Man\nFor All Seasons\", so as to\nspeak direct to the audience.\nContinuity is greatly helped\nby Marc Wilkinson's music\nwhich has just enough of \"Dr.\nKildare\" and \"Dr. Finlay\" to be\nrecognisable. Nicholl's director is the Michael Blakemore of\nhis earlier \" Joe Egg\" and his\nlater \"Forget-Me-Not-Lane\"\n(see Last Felix) \u2014\u2022 suffice it\nto say that here is a DirectorWriter partnership that is unlikely to be bettered. 10p buys\na ticket at the Old Vic. That\nis good value.\nBob Carter\nBy the time you read this\nthe 15th London Film Festival\nwill have finished. Luckily more\nthan half the films have obtained a distributor in the U.K. so if you were unable to see\nthe films at the festival you\nought to be able to see many\nof the films soon (in fact two\nfestival films: \" The Hired\nHand\" and \" W.R. Mysteries of\nthe Organism\" have already\nbeen released), the main exception is Andy Warhol's\" Trash\" which won't get a certificate for a very long time.\nThis year's London Film Festival showed over forty films,\nand I shall be taking a look\nat these and Richard Lewis,\nFilmsoc. Treasurer, has written\na review of \"Punishment Park\".\nAlso to be included is my review of Frank Zappa's\"200 Motels\".\nLet's get the rubbish disposed of first of all. Frank\nZappa's\"200 Motels\" is a very\nbad film. It is a mixture of\ngimmicky technical tricks and\nnothing much else. The film is\na look at the life of a rock\ngroup on the road and how\nit drives them mad: at times\nthis came over quite well, and\nat times the film was very\nfunny (an operatic aria about\npenises) but overall the technical gimmickry was tiring, the\nsound quality bad and the film\nitself was pointless.\nMany thanks to Richard\nLewis for submitting a review\nof Peter Watkin's latest film\n\"Punishment Park\".\nAlso at the London Film Festival, Peter Watkin's latest film\n\"Punishment Park\" is a pseudo-documentary much as\nhis earlier film \"The War\nGame\". The latter showed\nBritain under nuclear attack\nand its aftermath, \"Punishment\nPark\" documents how the\nAmerican Government could\nsuppress young political extremists under current legis la tion. The \"reporters\" take their\ncameras into a tent near\nPunishment Park, where the\nprisoners are being given a one-sided trial ending in a choice between a long prison\nsentence or three days in\nPunishment Park.\nNeedless to say the prisoners choose Punishment Park.\nThe cameras follow them as\nthey struggle across 50 miles\nof desert without food or\nwater, pursued by soldiers, to\nwitness their final massacre.\nAuthentic, gripping, shocking,\nthis is a film really worthwhile\nseeing.\nI only managed to see two\nfilms at the Film Festival, \"Two-lane Blacktop\" and \" W. U.S.A.\" Taking Monte Hellman's \"Two-lane Blacktop\" first. The\nfilm concerns two street racers\nthe driver, James Taylor (yes,\nthe James Taylor) and the\nmechanic, Dennis Wilson, who\nrace for money. They leave\nLos Angeles after winning a drag race and on the way to\nSanta Fe they pick up a girl\n\u2014they cruise on to win more\nraces then meet and challenge\nG. T.O.( Warren Oates) to a race at Washington D.C., the\nloser forfeiting his car, there\nfollows a race which is not\nvery exciting, but all through\nthe film the relationship between the girl and the three\nmen keeps on changing the\ncourse of the race. I didn't really like the film, it was very\nslow; the film didn't have the\nvisual appeal of \"Easy Rider\".\nAnd now for the best film\nI 've seen for some time, Stuart\nRosenberg'sW. U.S.A. The\nfilm is about Rheinhardt (Paul\nNewman), a drifter who drinks\ntoo much, works too little, and\nthinks too much, who works\nfor an ultra-conservative radio\nstation (W. U.S.A.) in New Orleans. The story is a little\ntoo complicated to give in\na synopsis form, but the story\nis very thought provoking, and\ngives a terrifying look at a potential fascist conspiracy\nthat fails in the USA, the whole\nfilm has a fine tinge of rea-lit y. Paul Newman as the\ncynical hero; Joanne Woodward as the hooker whom\nRheinhardt destroys and Anthony Perkins as Rainey, the\nman who is initially used by\nW. U.S.A. and is finally killed\ntrying to kill one of the leaders\nof the conspiracy: are all ex-cell ent. The film itself is very\ngood, Rosenberg has obtained\nfine performances from all\nthe people involved, and he\nhas directed a very good film\nwhich is worth seeing when it\nis released.\nI can't see any potentially\ngood films due for release in\nthe next four or five weeks,\nbut I'm sure I can see some\ngood films to tell you about\nin the next issue of Felix.\nHappy Christmas everyone.\nFRANK ZAPPA ETC., \"200\nMOTELS\" (U. A.) I 've only been left a small\nspace to review this record,\ndue to a large film review,\nwhich is a pity as I could write\na whole book on it. The album\nis of considerable interest in\nits own right, and listening\nto it gives a good idea of what\ngoes on in the film, although\nto be honest Zappa has done\nsome far better things. The\nRoyal Philharmonic Orchestra\nis used to good effect through-out, but just as a beautiful\norchestral passage gets under\nway it is cut short by a comment like \"What the f is that?\" which tends to spoil\nthings. The standard of playing by the Mothers is again\nhigh, but this album would\nappeal more to devotees of\n\"Freak Out\" than those of\n\"Hot Rats\".\nCHICAGO \"LIVE AT THE CARNEGIE HALL\" (CBS)\nThis album has, I'm afraid,\na whole stack of disadvantages before it even gets listened to. It is a quadruple\nalbum set, complete with two\nmonster posters and your very\nown full colour Chicago book,\nDISCS costing \u00a36.49, and while this\nis indisputably good value,\nsix quid is a lot to fork out.\nEven the dedicated Chicago\nfreaks who do buy the album\nwill find that the great majority of the tracks have appeared on the group's three\nprevious albums and only the\nvery dedicated Chicago freaks\nwill consider that these versions of songs they already\nhave are worth buying.. And while the album might stand\nas a \"Best of Chicago\" it\ndoesn't, because the production doesn't live up to such\na title, being only average as\nlive recordings go for most of\nthe album, while on the group's most famous tracks \"25 or 6\nto 4 \" and \"I'maM an\", the\nbalance is awful.\nThe musical ability of the\ngroup has never been in\ndoubt, of course. They are certainly the world's forerunners\nin \"brass-rock\" and in terms\nof sheer excitement, both on\nrecord and on stage, they can\nknock \"rivals\" Blood Sweat\nand Tears into the proverbial\ncocked hat. Their chief disadvantage has been the tendency to venture into pseudo-polemics: \" We gotta change\nthe system, brothers and sis-ter s\", and these dated clich es are much in evidence, reaching a nauseous nadir on \" A Song for Richard and His\nFriends\" which is, and I quote, \" A kinda wishful thought\nwishing President Nixon would\nquit\", but of course with no\nsuggestion as to who should\ntake his place. Ugh.\nHowever, if you either enjoy or can ignore such banalities there are plenty (by the\nlaw of averages?) of musical\nhighlights. The horns on\n\"Mother\", the flute on \"It\nBetter End Soon\", the guitar on\n\"South California Purples\" and,\nbest of all, the piano intro to\n\"Does Anybody Really Know\" are of particular interest. But\nit still seems a shame to have\nto pad these out on to four\nalbums with a lot of songs not\nvery different in arrangement\nfrom the original studio ver-s ions. Chicago may claim to\nbe anti-capitalism, but who the\nhell other than capitalists can\nafford this thing?\n\n"

    "content": "Thursday, 9th December, 1971 FELIX page 7\nNUS GONFERENG\nIt was a temperate day in London when your intrepid reporter\ndeparted with all seven of the IC delegation for the resort of\nMargate, on England's famed Costa del Slique d 'Huile. This fine\nplace, surpassed in beauty only by Southend, houses n,000 undoubted fools, n miles of golden sands (someone's colour-blind),\nand the Winter Gardens (with a liberal dash of winter included),\nwhich in turn houses the annual NUS conference, as it has done\nnow for 13 or so years.\nIt was anything but temperate in Margate; in fact, bloody freezing\nis the only way to describe it. This did not increase the enthusiasm\nof your reporter, who only discovered that he was going hours be-forehand, and had consequently come completely un briefed on the\nconference . . . . only to be surrounded by people wanting to know\nwhat one thought of so and such a motion, etc., etc.\nHaving sought out the Press Officer, I was presented with \"documentation\"\u2014about 500 sheets of it!!!! It was reassuring to discover\nthat it would be possible to understand what was going on without\nreading it all first. (This supreme example of the ultimate in Bumph\nhas been pickled and placed in the FELIX museum).\nYou will now, no doubt, be overjoyed to hear that, despite the\nfact that it is quite against my nature, I propose to now proceed\nto attempt to report the conference seriously. Any undue lightness\nthat you may object to you may put down to the mental structure\nof your reporter, which leaves much to be desired.\nOPENING SPEECHES\nThe conference opened with the opening speeches (funny?),\nstarring the Mayor of Margate and Jack Straw, now-retired NUS\npresident, in order of appearance and quality. Both were a mass\nof clich es \u2014the Mayor opened the conference as if it were the\nvillage fe te, the Straw sounded exactly like your actual middle-of-the-road Tory MP (he obviously has modelled himself on Ted\nHeath, as his speeches are delivered in the same manner, even\nthough his political temperament is different).\nStraw spoke, as you might expect, mainly on Autonomy. He considers that Mrs. Thatcher had made the Union proposals because\nof her \"plain, stubborn ignorance\" of what Student Unions are and\ndo. He outlined five traps into which the Union must not fall:\nfirstly, that of the alternatives to the proposals; secondly, that of\npublic accountability; thirdly, that of refusing to talk; fourthly, that\nof diversion into other matters, and fifth ly and lastly, that of dis-unity. He also showed a copy of a letter received that day from\nthe DES, in the popular personage of the Van Straubenzee, in\nanswer to twenty questions sent to him by the Executive\u2014this\nanswer, arriving 10 days after the questions were sent, contained\nno answers, as the Van Straub did not want to \"anticipate\" matters.\nObviously, he was peeved at the NUS not sending an SAE. However, the letter was, as claimed, \"cursory and insulting.\"\nUNION AUTONOMY\nThe Union Autonomy debate was the longest, but without doubt\nthe best, of the many of the conference. It and it's19 amendments were admirably compacted into just four hours. Much of the\nthanks for this are due to the chairman, Tony Klug, but perhaps\nwhat made is seem so orderly was the orderliness of the audience,\nwho lost their aura of a pack of sch dol kids sitting in a ten-hour\nlong assembly and were all actively intent on the subject. The\ncompleted motion, more than 2,000 words long, sets forth NUS\npolicy and plans for action, both in the interim and for a national\nco-ordinated campaign, the main features of which are a \"national\nday of action\" (which was yesterday: report on London events in\nFELICITY) and a mass demo on Sunday, January 23rd. Copies of\nthe completed motion, too long to reproduce even sections of\nhere, should be available from the Union. The debate consisted\nof many slanders against our virgin government, or rather g over ness. A veritable thesaurus of words and phrases, in fact, such\nas \"neo-nazi creeps\" \"reactionary bullshit\", \"infantile piss-artist\",\n\"k nick er twisting\", were levied in various directions, but all with\nthe same purpose. The only IC speech was from Piers, who\n(naturally) thought the proposals just a road to attack the left,\nand suggested more militancy. The amendment he was speaking on\nregretting that Executive had sought clarification from the DES on\nthe proposals, was defeated. Another amendment tabled by IC with\nUCL, recognising that the fight to reject the govt, proposals is a fight against the Government and not the College Authorities was\naccepted into the main motion.\nPiers took matters into his own hands at the end; as on-one\nofficially opposed the motion, Piers, on behalf of the movers of\nthe motion did, condemning it for insufficient militancy, and decorating his speech with other Spartican ideals. On the card vote\nthough, the motion was passed by 371,558 to 8,550, with 20,724\nabstentions. (For the unit in i a ted: no, there were not 400,832 delegates at the conference; that is the total number of students\nrepresented).\nGUEST SPEAKER, CLIVE JENKINS\nHe told the conference that the Labour movement must \"unite to\nattack Mrs. Thatcher\" (now that's a good militant ideal). He said\nthat he was prepared to lend his organisation (A.S.T.M. S., as if you\ndidn't know\u2014Assoc of Sci, Tech and Mang Staffs, if you still\ndidn't know), but he told me that Unions were not prepared to be\nanything more than sympathetic with undergraduates. P.G. s, how-ever, were a different story; they, he said, are now looked on as\ncheap labour, and the degree today had become devalued (well I never!). The Trade Unions will take a tough stance to prevent\nP.G. s being exploited. In accordance with this aim, he thinks that\nstudents should join unions now, to prevent a \"Graduate Proletariat\" coming in. He does not propose that T.U.s should compete\nwith the NUS, but be complementary, and he is not interested in\nany membership sub other than a \"purely nominal\" one. You may\nbe surprised, after reading the headlines of some of the popular\ndailies, that he believes that the general members of Trade Unions\nare on the side of the students. Moving to current trade union\nactivities, he said that pay, formerly a forbidden word, had now\njoined sex and politics as the exciting topics of the day. \"The most\nexciting four-letter word in the English language today is MORE\".\nHenceforth that word became the conference's vogue word, and\nwas to be heard shouted out at odd intervals in even odder places,\nsuch as during one of Jack Straw's speeches.\nSCHOOL STUDENT MEMBERSHIP\nBack to the debates. Another long and lively one proved to be\nthat on School Student membership, where, by a very large\nmajority, the motion proposing that a separate School Student's Union should be set up to protect the interests of scholars was\npassed. By a very close vote, a part of the motion proposing that\nthe NUS should collect subscriptions and undertake admin and\naccounting was defeated.\nThe proposals for Schools' Student Unions also includes provision for an annual conference and the election of a school\nstudents' committee, and generally beginning the bureaucracy at\nan even younger age!! This programme should be completed\nbefore the end of the academic year.\nIC took part in the Housing debate, something of great interest\nto everybody here, amending the motion, outlining the Unions'\nopposition to the system as it stands, to include anti-ac com agency publicity and legal harassing of them. This was Gordon\nFranklin's turn to speak: the unfortunate fact that half the conference decided to get up and go and have coffee at that time\nbears no relevance to his speech, which was well-received by\nthose remaining. Other amendments condemned the Government's \"Fair rents\" White Paper, which, it is feared, will be anything but fair to students.\nENTERTAINMENTS\nThis motion, passed overwhelmingly, condemned the exploitation of Student Unions by the Ents industry, and instructed the\nExecutive to set up a limited liability ents brokerage; also a report\non the feasibility of all social societies becoming limited companies will be presented to Birmingham conference in April. An\namendment calling for nationalisation of the ents industry was\ndefeated.\nSTUDENT GRANTS\nA motion censuring the Executive for their handling of the grants\nissue last year, and pressing for improvements in various sectors,\nsuch as for medical and dental students, London differentials for\nthose who do not have them, Improvements for PGs. The motion\nconfirms opposition to making students already in residence pay\nlevies for the provision of future accommodation and to other\nmatters such as the means test, and also notes the exploiting\nof students by some college authorities by increasing hall fees and\nmeal prices, for instance, as soon as the grant increase came\nthrough.\nUNEMPLOYMENT\nThe unemployment motion was originally passed on a show of\nhands, but, on a card vote, it was narrowly defeated. The motion\nprovided for support of demonstrations against unemployment, propaganda for schools, the government, and trade unions, and\ncalled for alternative economic policies. An amendment tabled by\nIC proposing Claimant's Unions be supported by SUs, was, along\nwith the other amendments, defeated.\nNUS ON ULSTER\nAnd so we come to Northern Ireland, where I.O's greatest contribution lay; in fact, the motion ended up being in our name\nonly. However, I cannot give you a full report, as the Press was\nexcluded from the first part of the debate after some very inconsistent ruling from the chairman. We were also excluded from a very important part of the Union Autonomy debate, which took\nplace during a scheduled closed session. FELIX joins with all\nother Student Newspapers represented at the conference in\ncondemning the actions of Conference and the Executive in excluding the Student Press from debates, since it prevents us from\ngiving you, the readers and members of the Student Union, a full\nand factual report on matters of great importance to the student,\ncommunity at large.\nThe original motion supported the anti-internment league and the\nCivil Rights campaign of civil disobedience in Ulster. The only\namendment to be passed was Imperial College's, iterating \"ab-hor rence of any form of violence\" and saying that only actively\narmed groups in Ulster can bring about violence. Rosemary Parker,\none of our Irish students, said \"I want you to show my countrymen\nthat you hate violence and injury as much as we do.\" We indeed\ngained fame by this speech, which was one of the few to be mentioned by nearly every national paper. There were a number, how-ever, who voted against the amendment, but, in any case, the\nwhole motion eventually fell. I think that the \"Guardian\"\nsummed up the situation best in their headline: \"Students find\nUlster too hot to handle\", and in their statement \" . . . eventually\nthrew out a hopelessly composite motion . . . calling for the withdrawal of the army to barracks and secular is ation of the province,\nbut expressing abhorrence of violence\".\nFORMALITIES\nThe conference ended with the ritual handing-over ceremonies\nand back-si appin g of the Executive. Kate Hoey, condemning such\n\"ego-trips\", resigned 40 minutes before the end of her term of\noffice, en route to giving herself the biggest ego trip of them all,\nalmost by getting a standing ovation. The new president, Digby\nJacks, then took over. Earlier, at a press conference, he told me\nthat the Union Autonomy issue would now overshadow everything\nelse, and, even if the Unions lost the battle to Mrs. T., he thought\nthat, although considerably weakened, the NUS and constituent\nunions would survive. His explanation for the govt, bringing out its\nproposals just before the Conference was in order that the latter\nshould pass self-discrediting proposals which could be used\nagainst the Unions\u2014this, he thinks, has not been done. Digby, as\neveryone knows, is a Commie: does this mean that the NUS will\nnow take a more left line? We must obviously wait and see, but\nJack Straw, for one, thinks it will not, as does Digby himself. Jack\nhas now gone to do his Bar Degree, and is proposing to stand\nfor Parliament as a Labour candidate\u2014that's if any constituency\nwill accept him! On his retirement as president, he was presented\nwith a \"bomb\" (not real), which he took great delight in throwing\nback at the audience (yes, folks, ANOTHER ego trip). And with a beautifully vociferous rendering of \"The Twelve Days of Conference\" presented by the Whiteland and Sussex \"Gay Liberation\nChoirs\", the conference ended.\nAltogether a very successful conference, I think (although it's my first, and first impressions don't usually count). I can personally vouch for the hard work and integrity of the l.C. delegation,\nwho gave conference their almost undivided attention (except\nwhen they slept, which was only about 3 hours a night, and even\nthen they probably dreamt about it) day and night. It was, indeed,\na very exhausting ordeal, with 12 hours of debates every day, from\n9 a.m. to midnight with few breaks only for snatched meals (no,\nNOT stolen). Perhaps the only real criticism I can make of the organisation of the conference is its over-organisation; it is steered\nwith an iron hand by Executive and Steering Committee who not\nonly decide when motions are to be discussed, but which ones\nare to be discussed: for example, no provision was made for any\ndebate on Ulster, and much time was wasted fitting it into the schedule when it was discovered that nearly everyone wanted to discuss it . . . . and originally only 90 minutes were allowed for\nAutonomy!! Perhaps a new system should be found.\nBANK CHARGES\nHow does it affect you\nAll of the \"big four\" banks (or \"big five\", as they used to be\nknown) dangle what one of their number so inanely calls \"no\nordinary\" carrot for the attention of students.\nThe idea, as we all know, is that banks normally demand payment from account holders for the privilege of letting them look\nafter your money. Provided certain conditions are fulfilled these\ncharges are waived for students. So to compete with each other\nthe banks offer prospective customers such attractions as flower-patterned cheque books, useless clip boards and racialist-condon-ing policies overseas.\nWhen you cease to be a student you would in the logical\ncourse of events, choose your banker because of his low bank\ncharges. But by now your bank hopes that you are too apathetic\nto bother to take your account elsewhere.\nA recent graduate an ex FELIX man has informed us of his\nexperiences. He first enquired of his existing bank, the Midland,\nand discovered that he was already being charged 8p per item, (i.e. every transaction) minus 2% of his mean balance over the previous\nsix months.\nHe then presented himself at the other three banks as a prospective customer. Barclays said they would charge 10p per item\nminus 2 J% of the mean balance over the six month period, whereas\nNational Westminster quoted 9p per item minus 2% of the mean\nbalance over the three months previous.\nLloyds was rather better, charging only for debit items, calculated\nat \u00a31.50 for the first 30 (5p each) and then 7Jp each thereafter\nminus 3% of the mean six monthly balance.\nSimple arithmetic will show you which bank is best for you,\nbut over a very wide range of usage and mean balances Lloyds is\nthe cheapest, and then National Westminster and Midland, with\nBarclays worst.\nIf you draw 30 debit items every six months and are paid\nmonthly by cheque (or other credit items), you must keep your\naccount in credit by \u00a350, \u00a381, \u00a3144 and \u00a3144 to avoid bank\ncharges by Lloyds, Nat. West., Midland and Barclays respectively.\nBut if your mean balance was only \u00a320 (such as may be the\ncase during your first few months out of college) you would be\ncharged 90p, \u00a32.44, \u00a32.48 and \u00a33.10 for six months by Lloyds,\nNat. West., Midland and Barclays respectively.\nOf course, if you're happy and able to keep a large balance in\nyour non-interest-earning current account you will probably avoid\ncharges, whoever your banker may be. And by the time you come\nto pay these iniquitous charges, the rates will doubtless have gone\nup and may have changed in rank. In the end you're advised to\nspend an hour shopping around\u2014this could typically save you \u00a35\nper year.\nDon't forget the Post Office Giro. They seemed unable to tell\nour scout exactly what it would cost due to pre-decimalisation\nleaflets (deliberate policy?). The advantages are Saturday opening\nand free postage. Transfers between account holders are free.\nOther transfers and cash withdrawals seem to cost about 5p each,\nthere are additional charges for stationery, but if your employer\nhas an account things work out rather cheaper. Unless Giro has\nclosed, which is extremely unlikely since most other European\ncountries have equivalents, it will probably improve considerably.\n\n"
