Previous to this, it had been an informal library for hostel residents, started\nin 1923. At first, it was housed in the\nPresidents offices but was later moved to\nthe Union building, and is now in Princes'\nGardens.\nInitially a small subscription was\ncharged but this was soon abolished and\nthe main source of income was a grant of\n\u00a350 from the Union, rising to \u00a3100 at\nthe end of the war. Now, the income is\n\u00a3550 from the College, a Touchstone grant\nwhich is intended mainly for Non-fiction\nand \u00a3350 from the UnHon. At present\nthere are approximately 7400 books:\n2600 fiction. 4700 non-fiction and 100 re-ference. Many periodicals are also avail-able. In 1958 there were 480 members;\nin 1959 \u2014 930, in 1960 \u2014 1200 and so\nfar this year there are 1100. The extent\nof the library is small, only 1500 sq. ft.\nbut it is hoped that when the new College\nblock is complete, the library will be\nlarger and will be able to include a records\nsection.\nThe library is managed by the Haldane\nLibrary Committee which consists of\nthree members of staff, three students\n(from the students committee), the libra ian Mr. Quinsee and the Chairman Professor Skempton. A second committee of\n'thirteen students, [including one representative from I.C.U. Council, arranges\nlunch-',ime librarians, and recommends\nbooks to be bought from the Union grant.\n'The Library is now situated on the\nfirst floor of Nos. 13 and 14 Princes Gardens. The rooms overlook the Gardens having french windows opening onto the balcony and have plenty of comfortable easy\nchairs. There are also on occasions interesting examples of modern art.\nAny member of the College may join\nthe Library by filling in a blue card.\nThree volumes may be borrowed for a fortnight but not more than two fiction\nbooks at the same time. The Library is\nopen: Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays\nfrom 11 a.m until 5.30 p.m. and Tuesdays\nand Thursdays 11 a.m. until 7.00 p.m. during term time. Books may be borrowed\nfor the vacations; but for those members still in College during vacations, the\nLibrary is open from 1.00 p.m. until\n5.00 p.m. Books may be reserved by asking the Librarian and there is a suggestions book for new additions.\nThere is a great diversity of books in\nthe Library: in the fiction selection many\nclassics are available as well as a wide\nselection of modern novels and short\nstories. There is also a large humour sect-ion, excellent for a lunchtime browse. Altogether the Library is an ideal place to\nspend an odd half hour, relaxing in com-fort. All told it makes a useful contribution to the liberal education of members\nof I.C. VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA\nDo you believe a man, suffering indescribable pain only poorly alleviated by\ndrugs, a burden to his family and friends,\nand with virtually no hope of recovery,\nshould be forced to continue living\nmerely because the law forbids any form\nof suicide? If so then your opinion is\nstrongly contested by the Voluntary\nEuthanasia Society supported by such\npeople as the Dean of St. Pauls (the\nVery Rev. W.R. Mathews), Lord Woolton, Val Guilgud, Rev. Leslie Weathehead, Sir Julian Huxley, Harold Nicholson, Etc., Etc., Lord Chorley, one time-Professor of Industrial and Commercial\nLaw at L.S'.E., is a Vice-President of\nthe Society, and the College is lucky that\nhe is to speak here on this topic on Tuesday week (Feb. 28th), at 5.40 in Chem.\nEng. Lecture Theatre, Room No. 102.\nI myself can see nothing wrong in the\nVoluntary Euthanasia Society's proposals\nfor reform in the Law, they conclude,\namongst others, the Conditions that:\n1. The applicant must be over 21 and\nof sound mind,\n2. There must be a Euthanasia Referee\nto whom 2 separate certificates must be\nsubmitted, one from the applicant's G.P. and the other from a specified qualified\nmedical pr act ici one r.3. This referee must visit the sufferer\nand fully satisfy himself that the request\nis above the board, and justified, and\nthat the applicant is fully aware what he\nis doing.\n4. The administration of Voluntary\nEuthanasia should be a responsibility of\nthe Minister of Health.\nMany Christians oppose this reform on\nsuch grounds as:\nIt is not for mortals to terminate their\nown lives, but that God in his wisdom\nwill decide when to call them \u2014 they\nquote the Commandement. \"Thou shalt\ndo no murder\" \u2014 but .there are very\nfew of us who do not believe in defending ourselves or others from the would-be fatal attacks of an a gresso r, even to\nthe extent, if necessary, of killing him,\nthe Bible does not state that the suicide\nis a sin. (It is inconsistent to belive that\nwe must not attempt to modify our life\nspan at all, since, this would mean that\nalmost any form of medical treatment is\nwrong, an idea held by very few people\nOR, that the acceptance of Voluntary\nEuthanasia is merely the thin end of the\nwedge; but the conditions I 've already\nmentioned surely exclude this, and any-way, the legal lising of divorce hasn't led\nto the complete upheaval of our ideas on\nmarriage.\nNo doubt some of you have yet further\npossible objections, so don't forget to\nvoice them at the meeting.\nThere is also to be a debate on Euthanasia on March 16th during the Lunchhour.\nJohn D. White\nHI from SI\nAs I sit here in the Felix copy room\nwith a typewriter before me and Rob\nthreatening me with a club I am rapidly\ncoming to the conclusion that it is again\ntime to come forth With some CARNIVAL\nNEWS.\nLast week has been rather successful\nfrom the Carnival point of view as we\nhave had a oo up je of meetings and a session with the local authorities, all of\nwhich produced some concrete results.\nfc k> do try to come to ea cn event, not\nonly you will have the time of your life,\nbut if we are lucky we might even raise\nsome money for the Oxford Committee\nR.C.S. MATHEMATICAL\nAND PHYSICAL SOCIETY\nAll members of the College are invited\nto a lecture:\nJOBBING MATHEMATICS To be given by\nMr. J.S. SEAGER\nfrom the Safety in Mines Research\nEstablishment,\nat 5.30 in the Phys. Leo. The.\nTea at 5.00 p.m. in the Lower Refectory.\nfor Famine Relief. To assist with this\nlatter requirement we are having a raffle, a Carnival Magazine and door-to-door collecting all of which we hope will\nbe supported mainly by the public. It is\nhere where you can help as we require\npeople to participate in these approaches\nto the public; in that way the CARNIVAL\nWEEK can be more for you, and less of\na man ey making scheme.\nHave you been to a Carnival Lunch?\nYou should try to attend some of them.\nThe first Carnival Lunch was attended by\n300 of your fellow students, and? I hear\nthat a fair number are planning to make\nthe Carnival Lunch a regular habit every\nMonday.\nHave you a girl for Carnival Queen? It\nis an excellent method of meeting some\ncharming girls as you can always use this\nfor your opening remarks. You can then\ntell her that she along- with the other\nnominations will be judged, and the three\nselections will be the Princesses of the\nMay Carnival Ball at which one of the\nthree will be selected as CARNIVAL\nQUEEN. You might even remind her that\nthe Queen will receive a gift from the Carnival.\nOn this note I shall close until next\nissue. Rob lay down that club I have\nfinished. How about that he clobbered me\nanyway, not that I blame him after reading this article.\nDear Sir,\nReading Mr. Carter's letter in the last\nissue of Felix reminded me of the advert-is ment of that allegedly religious organisation Moral Re-armament. For, on reading his letter, I was unable to find\namongst his tub-thumping and back- slapping any reason for his being attached\nto his ideas. In spite of being led to believe in the first para gr ph that we are to\nbe let into the secret of what makes 'Jim'\nfc ick. X can only it magi ney that aft\u00abr the\nfirst paragraph his brain (?) became disengaged as he reached for his pint.\nAnother similarity between his letter\nand the previously mentioned advert is ment is the use of the brief summaries,\nbetter called half truths. He states that\nthe terms of reference of the Imperial College Union are to foster the social and\nathletic waif are of the students. However,\non inspection of the Blue Book, which he\ncommends to us, I find that this is only\na third of the objects of the I.C.U. Section three of the objects states (in\nfull) that the purpose of the I.C.U. is:\n\"The provision of a corporate body of\nstudents of the Imperial College to safeguard and advance the interests of students of the Imperial College.\"\nIt is because this is an object of the\nUnion that I, along with many others\nargue the affiliation of I.C.U. to N.U.S. since that body was formed for the very\npurpose of safeguarding and advancing the\ninterests of students in general. A purpose,\nit would seem, that Mr. Career would\nrather our Union did not fulfill.\nIf my memory serves me correctly, this\nin affairs other than those social or athletic has only arisen since it seemed likely\nfear of Mr. Carter's of I.C.U. dabbling\nthat he would rise to his present position\nof em mine nc e.I recall that Mr. Carter,\nquite correctly, urged the Union to boycott South Africans goods last March, and\nindeed seconded a motion to this effect.\nI wonder what his action would have been\nif at that time the general climate of\nopinion in the Union had been against\nthis. Yours faithfully,\nR. Ellams\nDear Sir,\nI read the divergent set of stu der lt's views expressed on page 3 of the last\nFelix with great interest. Presumably I am free to draw the following conclusions:\na. Anyone who disagrees with Mr.\nCarter strongly enough to want to say\nso is a power-seeking demagogue;\nb. If everyone at I.C. agreed with Mr\nCox we would all be thinking men;\nc. Members of C. N.D. claim they are\nopen-minded, and this would be a valid\nreason for joining them;\n4. R.T.L. Fotheringham is writing\nunder an assumed name and defending a particular set of views because he has\nbeen 'commissioned' to do so.\nPlease if we are going to have serious\ndiscussion of student affairs in Felix \u2014\n1 hope we are \u2014 could we try and produce\na set of writers who are more interested\nin respecting and answering the cases of\ntheir opposition than in trying to overwhelm us with admiration for their\nclich es? For if this would be too much\nto ask of your contributors, then there\nreally is something wrong with I.C. Yours faithfully,\nDear Sir,\nPeter Walles\nIn my opinion Mr. Brassard, while reviewing 'L 'Avventura' in the last but on& edition of FELIX, has made a serious\nerror of judgement. The film does not\nend on a note of fantasy. There is nothing fantastic about Claudia's search of\nher fears of losing Sandro. They are r \u00abal\nas is later proved.\nHe also expresses dissatisfaction with\nthe ending. I think ft s ending was the\ngreater thing in the film. It is tru that\nClaudia forgives Sandro. That is not im-port ant. What is important is the way\nin which this is done. In a moment of\ncomplete self knowledge Sandro realises\njust what he is \u2014 a philanderer. Claudia\ntoo knows it and ye* she accepts him\nwholly as he is and is content. There is\ncourage here and strength, but without\nthe frills of sentimentality.\nThere could not have been any other\nending capable of doing credit to the film.\nTo end it earlier would left a doubt as to the\nhappy outcome of the affair. Both lovers\nhonestly and sincerely hoped to make it\ndifferent to make it last. But they forgot\ntheir limitations. It is only in the end, so\nsuperbly contrived, that we realise that\ntheir happiness is the result not so much\nof ignorance, as of a frank acceptance of\nthe way they both are, an acceptance of\ntheir essential humanity.\nA. A. Qureshi. P.G. Chem. Eng.\nDear Sir\nAfter perusing Felices for over two\nyears, I think it is my turn to add to\nthe large mass of illogical, inconsistent,\ninfantile and inaccurate writings which I have stupidly wasted my time ploughing\nthrough in an attempt to glean interest-ing, important and 'Imperial' in format ion. The only reason I continue my\nploughing is that occasionally I do glean\nsomething (for example, I much appreciate your reviews of films etc.), and now\nI would like to make a few comments\nfrom which I hope your other readers will\nglean something:\n1. I was overjoyed to read that at last\nJ. Carter was going to put down on\npaper, in his own succ in t way, why he\nis 'so passionately attached to such ideas\nas I.C. Union not joining N.U. S.,I.C. W.A. not being allowed in the bar\netc.' But perhaps the Editor found his\nletter too long, just as he found John\nCox's 'Comment' too long at the beginning of the term, for I could find no explanation in Mr. Carter's letter, merely\na few highly controversial statements.\n2. Dxvx Wxlbrxhxm, under the\n'Fotheringham' pseudonym, counter- comments that N. US. has been plugged five\ntimes in succession \u2014 clearly he cannot\ntake a hint, for he has not bothered even\nonce to explain why he is against it, and\nas impartial members of I.C. will re mem ber, at the Union meeting which rejected\nN.U.S., not one speaker on Wxlbrxhm's side had any case to make. I myself was\ndubious of the advantages of joining\nN.U.S. j last May, but after the Union\ndiscussion, I saw the 'light'.\n3. Otter writers have dealt with if, or\nwhy, I.C. doesn't give a 'mature' e duc ation. As I see it, if the Governors want\nto increase Union activities, the only way\nto do this without upsetting the curricula\nis to built new hostels and this is being\ndone. Our students do not fritter away\nall their spare time, but at present there\nis still incentive to spend it here rather\nthan at home or in their lodgings. The\nso-called 'brown-b agger' is an exaggerated\nidea, all of us have extra-mural interests,\nbut many of these are more pleasantly\ncatered for outside College. The lack of\nsupport for Union meetings is quite understandable \u2014 most students do not feel\nthat the activities at these meetings are\nlikely to affect them appreciably, but if\nfor example, all the refectories were\nclosed for a week without explanation or\nalternative arrangements being, made,\nthen a meeting to discuss this would almost certainly be well attended.\n4. Most of us accept the idea that one\nman one vote is a good principle I wonder how many of us realise that this\nicc e pts the intrinsic inequality that one\nman by his fecundity will have far more\ninfluence on the society in and after his\nold age than more moderate man?\nYours faithfully\nJohn D.

After\neighteen bouts Guilds won through with\n60 points, against 28 from Mines and 15\nfrom R.C.S. There was the usual lack of competition in the lower weights, but no unearned\nadvantage was gained as the fly, bantam\nand featherweight divisions were won on\nwalkover s by R.C.S., R.S. M., and C.&O, respectively.\nThe best boxer of the evening was\njudged to be J. White (O.&G.) who won\nthe heavyweight division. His bout with\nJ Fairfield (R.S. M.) was a fine display,\nfor which Fairfield was awarded the best\nlosers cup. This cup was generously presented by C.C. Seaford Esq., President\nof the Boxing Club.\nAnother good display was that of G. Mackie (O.&G.) who won through two\nvery hard bouts before announcing a truce\nwith the other lig h welter finalist, another\nGuildsman.\nThe bout between P. Mousses-Jones\n(R.S'. M.) and the physically formidable\nA. Butler ( C.&G.) was convincingly\nfinished b v the polished left hook of the\nMiner in the first round. Those who saw\nButler's punching power demonstrated in\nhis previous bout could hardly have expected this result.\nThe M.C. for the evening was Mr. Brian\nShaw, Captain of the U.L. Boxing Club.\nHe had a hard time making himself heard\nover the riotous applause and encourage-ment, but no harder a job than that of\nthe seconds and L.A.B. A. officials. The\nthanks of the C! ub are due to these\ngentlemen, and to all those- who helped\nwith the organisation, particularly J. Henry Esq., Vice-President of I.C. Bx.C. it. CROSS COUNTRY\nFirst report is the result of the Q.M. C. invitation 7\u00a3 mile race. In this the I.C. team was much weakened by injury and\ntwo members John Collins and Dave\nHammonds were out representing their\ncounties in the Intercounties match at\nBihgley. However, this weakened sido\ndid very well to finish seventh behind\nteams like Oxford and Cambridge and it\nwas awarded the John Banks Trophy for\nbeing the first London team home.\nOn Wed. 1st Feb. in what should have\nbeen a second team match we completely\nswamped teams from L.S.E. and Charing\nCross and Westminster Hospitals having\nthe first four out of our six in the first\nseven.\nResult:\nI.C.16L.

In a field of\n20 I.C. was placed second to Cambridge,\nbeating Oxford, Bristol, all the London\nCollege teams and many others. Mainlv\nres posible for this fine result were J. Collins (4), J. Cleator (5), T. Wilkins\n(10), and a fast improving runner J. Greenleaf (22). The second team also ran\nvery well and beat all the other second\nteams in the field'. ,\nOn the following' Wednesday the first\nteam travelled to Reading for an annual\ntriangular match agin st the University and\nthe R.A.M. Sandhurst. Over a very unusual course which included a wide canal\nwaist deep with muddy water we were\nclosely beaten into third place.\nResult:\nReading 52\nR.A.M.59I.

CONCERT HALL.\nRUGBY\nOn February 1st the table tennis room\nwas packed full with spectators to witness\none of the semifinals of the Carribean Cup\nbetween I.C.I and Woolwich I. Tension\nin the room was high as the vital match\nbetween our number one, C.C. Chow and\ntheir number one S. Kalinka, was started.\nChow was off to a bad start and was\nsoon several points behind, but by some\nvery strong and consistent attacking he\nslowly but surely recovered and went on\nto win this match to put I.C, one up. Inspired, perhaps, by this opening win, our\nteam couldn't go wrong, and the final result was a win for Imperial College by\nfive games to one. The final will be played\"\nat U.L. U. against Kings where all supporters will be welcome.\nThe first team completed their league\nfixtures with a convincing 8-2 win\nagainst R.D. H.I and although they have\nundoubtedly won promotion back to div-The Gutteridge Cup Semi-Final between I.C. and Q.M. C. was played on\nWednesday, February 8th, and resulted in\na narrow (and somewhat lucky) win for\nI.C. by a try and a penalty goal to a try\nI.C. had (on paper at least) a massive\nand over hel ming advantage which they\ndid not use to full effect. It seems a pity,\nfor they should be able to paralyse any\ncollege pack with such seasoned veterans\nas Bridges and Bregazzi and an 'ember asse de ric hesse' in the front row (especially\nnow that Howell has returned after hooking for Bridgend during most of the\nseason).\nThe forwards follow up well, pack well\nboth in the loose and the tight, and defend\nwell, but when the ball moves across the\nfield, they don't seem to be able to look\nfor it, follow it and heel it,\nAfter all that criticism, let's return to\nthe game. I.C. started off by throwing\nthe ball about, but the Q.M. C. pack were\ncontent to be pushed about, broke quick lv and I.C. centres often died with the ball.\nSeed and McCromack were forced to kick\nand mightily they did, McCromock'she f tv punts often gained 60 yards or so of\nground, and Seed kicked over his shoulder\ntime and time again to drive Q.M. C. back\ndown to their 25.\nAfter ten minutes there was a loose maul\njust outside the I.C.25, and someone\npicked the ball out of it. A penalty was\ngiven and luckily, for it was kick able, the\nQ.M. C. boot topped it.\nIn trying to prevent the try, Margretts\nthe I.C. captain was con cussed and had\nto go on the wing. At intervals he staggered off to be sponged down by 'Doc'\nSparkes, the Club President.\nJust before half time, Bragazzi split a finger, not long after missing a difficult\npenalty, and played the rest of the game\nwith his hand bandaged.\n3-0 down at half time, being beaten at\nthe back of the scrum, and the outlook not\ngood at all. Come on I.C. was the cry as\nthe game restarted.\nCut and thrust up front, with the I.C. pack trying to grind Q.M. C. into the mud,\nwas now the order of the day, and a pushover try was narrowly averted by Q.M. C. collapsing the scrum. An infringement\ngave I.C.a penalty from which Bregazzi\nscored to level the scores. Still Q.M. C. did not give up, and another try was narrowly averted by Millard's running half\nthe length of the field to drop on the ball\nfor a twenty-five.\nAt last I.C. scored, Seed charging\naround the scrum and going over. And\nthat was it.\nI.C. could have been 11 points down at\nhalf time if Q.M. C. had had a kicker,\nand they must improve for the final, which\nfor the umpteenth time is aga is t Kings.\n/On Saturday I.C. had their best day\never. 8 wins, 1 lost, which was the first\nteam, 8-6 down to O. M.T.'s Ex. 1st. Highlights of the day were the President's try, and the despondency of the Welshmen in the bath at Harlington. The policy\nof the lower teams keeping together has\nbeen more than justified in recent weeks.\nIt all makes for good club spirit\nBADMINTON\nTHE 13 th\nHYDE PARK\nROAD RELAY\nThis Saturday sees the invasion of the\nUnion by students from all over Great Britain. A record number of 80 teams are\nexpected to compete in the largest road\nrelay race in Europe perhaps the world.\nThis year the race will run over an\nentirely new course, owing to the road\nworks at Hyde Park Corner and Marble\nArch, . and approximately encircles the\nSerpentine. The start will be at the west\nend of Rotten Row, in front of the Lido,\nat 3 o 'clock prompt. Martyn Lucking\nhas kindly consented to st-art the race.\nMartyn was last year's University Athletics Captain, and represented Great Britaii'\nin the Rome Olympics.\nThe outcome of this year's race is as\nopen as ever. Durham University will have\nto improve on previous performances this\nyear to retain the SirRoderic IJill Cup.\nOn current performances. Manchester\nUniversity seem to be the favourites,\nclosely followed by Birmingham University and the Loughborough Colleges. Other\nteams that need to be watched are Sheffield and Imperial. The Imperial College\nUnion Cup, for the minor colleges, should\ngo to Borough Road Training College.\nLondon, or possibly Queen's or Selwyn\nat Cambridge. Some very fast laps are\nexpected; Steve James, Tim Briault,\nMike Tribe of Cambridge Colleges, along\nwith Jack Heywood of Reading, should\nall break 14.00 minutes.\nBest known runner of all, however, will\nbe Herb Elliot, who will appear in the\ncolours of Jesus College, Cambridge.\nAt time of going to press, The Cross\nCountry Club were very cagey about the\nnome team. It will, I think consist of\nJohn Collins, John Cleator, Ted Wilkins,\nGeorge Wenk, and any two from Jim\nBernard, Dave Hammonds, Jeff Greenleaf and Pete Warren.

C. only to lose by the same\nscore to U.C. later. Ample revenge was\ngained by the first team, however, with\na63 victory over a U.C. side, which\nread like a scratch University team. The\nteam chose the right day to hit form and\nwere helped by a lethargic display from\nU.C.' s first pair.\nIt is to be hoped that the team does\nnot suffer a psychological 'reaction' after\nclearing this hurdle because there are\ngames ahead which will not be easy b v any means.\nis ion I it is not yet certain whether they\nare top of their league. I. GC Last Saturday the first and second XIs\nwere playing in U.L. Cup semi-finals. The\nfirst team, playing on the King's College\nground, beat Battersea 1st by 4-3. With\na high wind and comparatively dry ground,\nthe conditions were against good football,\nbut both teams fought hard for a place\non the final. With the wind behind them\nin the first half, Battersea took a31 interval lead, but a penalty goal early in\nthe second half put I.C. back into the\ngame. Playing more confidently the I.C. team scored two further goals, and thus\nqualified to play King'sI, who beat L.S.E. in the final at Motspur Park.\nI.C.2 nd XIs semi-final against Battersea II was also close struggle.

STARVING HORDES RIOT\nChaos reigned at the Opening Ceremony\nof the first Carnival Lunch held last Monday in the Concert Hall of the Imperial\nCollege Union. In the absence of the President of the Union, whom it appears,\nwas being entertained to lunch elsewhere,\nthe festivities of the day were opened by\nthe Union Secretary, Jim Carter. A jibe\nfrom the back of the Hall \"Are we quo-rate?\" brought a round of mirth.\nAfter a few words of note Jim proceeded\nto the lucky dip, the prize being a theatre\ndate with the Queen of Jezebel, Miss Judy\nLewis. Jim's luck was out, however. After\ncalling six different numbers and gaining\nno response from the audience he gave\nup and offered the prize to the first parson who could supply a sock. This left\nthe audience dumbfounded. What suo tle trick had Jim's quick con to red mind con-tri ved? After an uncomfortable pause a panting individual charged forward and\npresented... a sock. When asked his\nname he did not at first seem to bee sure\nP. Something Smith was the reply. He\nwas obviously in an extremely confused\nstate and it was only some delay that it\ntranspired his true name was, in fact,\nD.S. Strand.\nFinlay D. McPherson, who happened to\nbe on his way to a poetry meeting, dropped\nin to entertain, so he thought. His\nofferings were met with cries of derision\nand the passions of the assembled mob\nwere raised so high that a barrage of cardboard plates and plastic beakers rained\ndown, on our unwanted literary genius.\nOwing to the aerodynamic instability of\nthese missiles, however, few of them\nreached their target.\nCarnival Organiser Si Lyle then stepped\nfor wad and brought the ceremony to a close with a certain amount of propaganda\nand a 'joke' of do bio us standing.\nOn Thursday, 9th February Bo proceeded to a garage in Putney where under\nthe eyes of three white triangles he\nunderwent a certain test. For this purpose\nit was necessary that his array of lamps\nbe increased by one. This had to be done by\ndefacing him with the addition of a 'cycle\ntail lamp'. Thus bedecked and with a Crew who were rather worried by the efficiency of his brakes, he was submitted\nto the mechanic's care. A short time later,\nafter only one query Bo as declared safe\nin all respects. The query was that it appeared that his king pins wer^e rather\nworn. This problem was easily solved when\nit was explained that Bo had no king pins\nand his frontal support relied on a series\nof bearings.\nBOANERGES MAKES THE GRADE\nThus Bo has become the first of three\nI.C. vehicles to pass the 10 year test. It\nis necessary, however, for the cycle lamp\nto be replaced and the Vice Captain of the\nCity and Guilds Motor Club would be\nmuch obliged if anyone who knows the\nwhereabouts of an oil tail lamp would contact him.\nJezebel, it has been found, was only\nregistered as a private vehicle five years\nago and apparently does not have to take\nthe test.\nAs for Clementine II, she has been seen\nabout, but little of her present condition\nis known.\nJAZZ AT U.L.U.\"I have never had to judge a jazz competition of such a high, standard.\" Heckler: \"You said that last year.\"\nThus Benny Green, to the judges*\nbegan his summary of the University of\nLondon Jazz Festival held at U.L. U. on\nJanuary 25th, his clich ed comments contrasting nicely with the creative music\nthat had preceded them.\nEight bands took part, and it soon ber\ncame evident to I.C. participants that\ntheir opposition was tremendous.\nGoldsmiths opened with a fairly convincing New Orleans group which, how-ever, suffered from lack of rehearsal. The\nthump of their tuba gave way to the\nmelodic lines of John Farnsworth's baas,\nas the Stan Salmons Quartet took the\nstand. The group, which was the first of\nthe I.C. contingent to face the fans, swung\nquietly and tightly from the start. It\nshone in Stan's'' Six-Four Blues\", in\nwhich Mike Porter, featured on flute,\nfairly effervesced swinging phrases, and\nStan discovered some cross-rhythms which\ndelighted the audience but were evidently\ntoo much for Benny Green.\nA piano-less quintet from Chelsea then\nmade some lovely West Coast noises,\nblowing arrangements written by their\nbaritone player. The voicing was beautiful\nand had their improvised passages been as\ngreat as the written ^ones, they would\nprobably have won.\nWhen phenomenally competent trumpeter Murray Smith lead the I.C.t rad. band into their session, we were in tor\none of the high spots of the evening. The\nrock-steady beat and really musical frontline counterpoint made this group exciting and always interesting. Worthy of\nspecial mention was the fine clarinet-play-ing of Phil Cammerman. Little wonder that\nthey carried off joint first prize at the\nend of the evening. By comparison, the\nL. S.E.t rad, band which followed, though\nvery good, was a little monotonous, lacking the sense of climax of the I.C. group.\nNext Q.M. C. put on a mainstream outfit whose performance was somewhat impaired by the poor intonation of the trumpet and alto, particularly noticeable in\nunison passages.\nBack to I.C. for the Jazz. Consortium\nwith Walter Skinner on alto, Richard\nRushton on piano, John Farnsworth on\nbass, and Mike Smith on drums. Mike\nshowed remarkable versatility: earlier\nhe was restraining his drumming for the\nclosely-knit introvert jazz of the Stan\nSalmon's Quartet; now, backing the ef-fu sive'^ Richard Rushton, he was driving\nthe combo along with a relaxed swing.\nNeedless to say, the group had a big re-ce pti on. The last line-up was the U.C. modern\nquintet (tenor, vibes, bass, drums, and\npiano), and the polished sound of this\ngroup, suggesting a great deal of experience behind it, certainly earned them\nthe first prize, which they shared with\nI.C.' stra d. band.\nIn his summary, Benny Green labour ed the point that the \"Six-Four Blues\" went\ninto 4/4 for the solos, a point which Stan's group h atl deliberately underlined (mus-ic ally speaking), and also claimed that\nthe Consortium's \"Flamenco Sketches\"\nwas too ambitious. Both groups took it\nas a compliment that Mr. Green found\nsuch difficulty in offering them constructive criticism.\nThe evening was a great success for\nthe I.C. Jazz Club which had two pictures in the Press, a pot, and valuable\nexperience (as well as enjoyment) for its\nmusicians. It has high hopes for the two\nquartets when they meet the pick of the\nUniversities' bands at Southampton on the\n22nd of this month.\n- UNIONNEETING\nINQUORATE\nby Finlay McPherson\nThe Imperial College Union meeting on\nFebruary 9th was declared in quo rate, and\nwas never opened. The quorum is 400 and\nsome 330 people, in fact, appeared. The\nnext meeting will be held in March.\nUnder no circumstances could the blame\nbe put on publicity; the publicity was\nmore than adequate. Why did only 11\npercent of I.C. turn up?\nThe reason of course seems obvious;\nstudents aren't interested in the abolition\nof the means test; in short, student\naren't interested.\nTo go to a debate; to go to a constituent college meeting; to go to a discussion group and see the total lack of\nspeakers, is most disheartening. People\nrefuse to act. Unsure of what) they wish\nto say; afraid to say it because of the\nridicule of friends and fellow-members,\nthey slip back into the haze of anonymity.\nIt is a tragedy to behold the met amor p nos is taking place at I.C. The change from\nthe eager student to the dull, book-bound,\nmtr over tad, specialist dc moronic technician is a retrogression in evolution.\nGraduates from this college often wonder why promotion is so elusive in industry ; why they, with their honours de-g rees, are passed over in favour of men\nwith little or no education. Is it sur pris ing? After all, the student has no sign\nof responsibility, no desire for original\nthought.\nIt is well nigh time that we became\naware of the struggle for existance; realised that if one wants something one\nhas to reach out and get it. It will not\nbe handed to you on a silver salver.\nIf members of this Union desire the\nabolition of the means tost, they must\nfight for it. Each person must contribute\nin the shout for action if the fight is to\nbe won. Each stud etat must ACT if\nthis Union is to thrive.\nA Debating Competition has been organised between Mines Guilds and R.C.S. The fir at round had taken place. Only\n80 people turned up only 2 spoke from\nthe floor. Perhaps you will begin to see\nthe seriousness of the situation.\nIt is not too late; not yet. Some of\nyou are not yet gripped by the cycle of\ndecadence. It is up to you to contribute;\nto come to Union Meeting; to speak and\nnot care a damn what the other fellow\nthinks, and by this method, by the into-grated activity of Union members perhaps\na Union spirit will be invoked and the disgusting s spec fc a cle of an in quo rate Union\nmeeting will never be seen again.\nYEOMAN of) GUARD\nJ FEB. 20 - 24\nINCREASED REFECTORY CHARGES A meeting of the Refectory Committee,\nconvened on Wednesday 1st February,\nagreed on the following increased charges\nto take force as from Wednesday 5th, April 1961.\nThe necessity arises from higher overheads and increased wage bills.\nSweets by Id..\nSoup, when waiter ess served, by Id.,\nSandwiches by Id. or ^d., Special teas by 6d., Roll and butter by \\\nCertain dinners by amounts ranging\nfrom 6d. to 1.6d, DEBATING\nCHALLENGE CUP\nThe first round of the competition took\nin the Concert Hall on February 9th The motion before the House was \"That\nthis House is worried about the preservation of Rural Britain.\"'\nThe motion was proposed by Mines and\nopposed by R.C.S. The speeches were interesting and one or two of the speakers,\nnotably P. Buet, E. Foresthall and A. Logan were very amusing.\n(After deliberation the judges declared\nMines the winner by 286 points to 274.\nThr second round will have taken place\nby the time this reaches you but the third\nround, the final round, takes place in the\nConcert Hall on 23rd February. The mot-ion, proposed by Guilds, is \"That this\nFIousp thinks that television is the idiot's lantern,\" \u2014 Mines are opposing.\nThe round should be exciting and it is\nImped that as many people as possible will\ncon v1 along, and speak, and generally give\ntheir team maximum possible support.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 3\nEditorial comment]\nFree Speech\nElsewhere on this page is printed a letter setting a number of points against\nFelix. Although this is the only letter re-Elsewhere on this page is printed a let-ce i ved to date on this subject it is obvious\nthat this writer does not stand alone. He is\none of many who would prompt the question \"What is Felix for?\"\nTo answer this question we may profitably look back a very, very long way. On\nFriday, December 9th1949, appeared\nFelix No. 1. It consisted of five duplicated\nsheets secured together with staples. Page\ntwo carried the editorial comment which\nwe reproduce here:\n\"The need has been felt for some time\nfor a frequently published journal to comment on the affairs of the College whilst\nthey are still topical ,and to bring to the\nattention of its members the activities of\nClubs and Societies of which people at\npresent know little; and knowing little\ntend to care even less. This is a function\nwhich clearly cannot be performed by i he Phoenix, particularly since that estimable\nbird is now to appear only twice a year,\nand so Felix has to come to meet the\nneed. We do not intend to encroach upon\nthe literary field covered by the Phoenix;\nrather do we intend to be complementary\nto that journal, even if not always com-pli ment ary. Neither are we in any way\nconnected with it, nor are we its offspring.\nNo, the Phoenix will remain an essentially\nliterary magazine, where as we shall content ourselves with providing a commentary upon events and personalities.\"\nThus we have, set out this first paragraph of this first editorial, the basic\nfunctions of the newspaper which, everyone must agree, are of fundamental im-port ance. The columns of Felix are wide\nopen to those who, possessing the courage\nof their convictions, wish to make their\npoint of view widely known among those\nwho are sufficiently interested to take\nnote. Such is Felix at present.\nIn the second paragraph of this first\neditorial the writer envisaged the difficulties which the paper was about to face.\nHe is to be congratulated on his foresight.\nThe problems he mentioned are a constant\nsource of trouble.\n\"The success or failure of this paper\ndepends principally on you, our reader. In\nthe first place we depend upon you to\nproduce many of our articles and reports,\nsince our staff cannot themselves attend\nand report every College event. Secondly\nwe depend on you to maintain a lively\ncorrespondence in our columns. Here is\nan opportunity for you to air your op in ions, ideas, and grievances to the whole\nCollege instead of just to those within earshot of the bar, and replies can be published before everyone has forgotten what\nthe original letter was about. Thirdly we depend on you to buy your own copy of Felix,\nand not just to read somebody else s copy.\nWe do not think that 3d. is beyond the\nfina cia l scope even of a student trying to\nlive on a F.E.T. grant, and copies for a term cost less than a pint of beer.\"\nTo return to the question in hand. Mr.\nIrvine states, \"It might be said that the\nstudents are failing in their duty to the\nmagazine in that they will not contribute\narticles of a suu ff ici ent ly high standard\nto be included in it, but I find it difficult\nto biel i eve that the editors receive no such\narticles.\"\nIncredulous though Mr. Irvine may be,\nsuch is the case. It would be near impossible for Felix to emulate any of the national dailies or even any well known\nstudent paper such as 'Sennet', 'Varsity',\nor 'Kings News'. These are dominated by\nmembers of tho Arts '(Faculties* Journalism and science are antipathetic. The\ntalent does not exist at I.C. and never will.\nHaving thus confirmed the darkest of\nMr. Irvine's fears there seems little more\nto say. The situation is that here at I4C.\nthere is little interest in pure journalism.\nIt seems that this is one direction in which\nthe scientific mind does not readily move-We must accept the fact that Imperial\nCollege is a college of science and technology and those of us who feel out of place\nhere must make the most of it.\n1000 FELIX REPORTERS read Felix\nfortnightly. Are you one of them? Have\nyou anything to report? If so then drop\ninto the Press Room (third floor of Union\nBuilding, opposite lira) any lunch-time\nbetween 1.00 p.m. and 1.30 p.m, COPY DAY for the next issue (Friday\n3rd March) will be Wednesday 22nd February for all letters, feature articles\netc., and Sunday 26th February for all\nsport and other contributions concerning\ntopical matters.\nDear Sir,\nWe read in todays papers (Wed. 1st Feb.) that the Oxford students magazine\nhas been censored by the Proctor. The\nimportant question as to whether or not\nthis was a good thing in the interest of\nfree speech does not at the moment concern me (though it would make a good\ntopic for an article), but the news did\nmake me wonder if such a thing could\nhappen to 'Felix'. T was sorry to came\nto the conclusion that it could not. Sorry\nbecause it seems to be a reflection on\nthe authority of the magazine. In other\nwords, the paper is so un-important< that\nits criticism (if any) are looked on with\nlittle seriousness by those people who\ncould in fact change things. Iais is a serious paper and statements in it are apparently taken to hear* by everyone at\nthe college. The undergraduates at Imperial College, however, look to 'Felix'\nas a cartoon magazine, a viewpoint which\ncannot be blamed entirely on them s inc \u00ab\nit is the editors who will not put the\ncontroversial! into (the paper. It might\nbe said that the students are failing in\ntheir duty to the magazine in that they\nwill not contribute articles of a sufficiently high standard to be included in it,,\nbut I find it difficult to believe that the\neditors receive no such articles. In any\ncase is the duty of the editors to find\nstories of the required standard, and if\nthey were to start this, then I have little\ndoubt that the trend would continue. If\nthis failed, then we could only conclude\nthat the students at Imperial College are\nas narrow minded as many people outside the College would like to believe.\nAt least we could sav we tried.\nYours faithfully,\nW.A. Irvine, Chem Eng.\n1\nCOMMENT. by John Cox\nI will open this week with an apology\nto Mr. Fotheringham for my attack of\nlast week. It would never have occured\nif I had known that he didn't necessarily\nbelieve in what he wrote. Furthermore,\nmy attack on his alleged censorship was\na result of information given to me by\nDave Wilbraham and I accept Mr. Fotheringham's statement that the allegation\nwas without foundation. While in this\nmood I would like to congratulate our\nPresident on his decision not to open the\nin quo rate Union meeting. Some people\nsuggested that he should have opened and\nclosed the meeting again immediately thus\nsatisfying the requirements of the Union\nmeeting a term. In the long run this\nwould have been extremely damaging and\nwould not solve the problem at all when\nwe came to the A.CM. when members\nof Council are to be elected.\nIn the event of a quorum not being\nobtained this term, I would suggest the\nonly legal way out of the impasse to be,\na request by Council, to the Governing\nBody, to revoke their decision to ratify\nthe raising of the quorum from 200 to 400.\nHumiliating as this course is, it is better\nthan either ignoring the Constitution, or\ngetting without any Union meetings ana\nsix members of Council.\nI doubt whether a quorum oi 4U U can\nbe achieved in the future. Probably the\nnext attempt in March will be successful,\nprobably every first Union meeting of the\nyear will be attended by more than 400.\nBut I do not except any A.G.M. to be\nquo rate unless it is held a long time before\nthe examination period. Quite independant of subject matter, publicity and such-like, a quorum of 400 in the Union Concert Hall means a fair amount of disco m fort' to a large number of people who\nmust stand at the back. A quorum of\n300 is far more realistic until the new\nas eni bly hall has been built.\nI noticed a novel interpretation of the\nwords \"power seeking demagog es\" in Jim\nCarter's Setter to Felix last week. A demagogue usually changes his opinion to suit\neach situation. He has an extreme contempt for authority when possessing none\nhimself, and a complete faith in authority\nimmediately upon achieving it. People\nsupporting such policies as N.U.S. af-fil i ation, constantly, despite consequent\nunpopularity, cannot be \"demagogues\",\nand their \"power seeking\", if it exists,\nis con cio us ly inefficient. However,\n\"power seeking demagogues\" undoubtedly exist at LC.\nCOUNTER COMMENT,\nby R.T.L. Fotheringham\nI thank Mir. Cox for his apology but I am sorry to see that he has not the\nmagnanimity to leave it unqualified. The\nsomewhat sly play on names is rather\nfutile.\nAs I pointed out last issue my object\nis to present an opposing case to that\nin Comment. This week the task is difficult as the main topic is the attendance\nat the Union meetings, a subject on which\nmost people agree.\nMr Cox is the Union Publicity Officer\nand is responsible for advertising Union\nmeetings. The publicity this year has been\ngood, and it is not possible to blame in-quo rate meetings on lack of knowledge.\nThe claim that lack of seating reduces\nattendance does not seem altogether valid\nas even with ISO people standing at the\nback, there (always seem to be vacant\nseats in the hall. The conclusion must be\nthat out of 2,800 students there are not\n400 interested enough to attend. This conclusion is upheld by the impression that\nthe same people attend every meeting;\nthere must be a large number of students\nat I.C, who have never attended a Union\nmeeting.\nIt does seem that a quorum of 300 is\nmore reasonable, but surely we can gat ner400 people to change our own Constitution\nrather than go cap in hand to the Governors.\nCasaell's dictionary gives for demagogue:* a leader of the people; an a gita to i who appeals to the passions and prejudices\nof the people.' The N.U..S advocates,\nlike any other faction leaders, are admired\nby their own followers and disliked by\ntheir antagonists. I think the cap of\ndemagogue fits Mosley and Foot just about\nequally. Perhaps a poll would decide the\npost of the Union demagogue. Applicants\nshould chain themselves to the Colcutt\nTower and with luck, will be buried\nduring the demolition. This will solve all\nour problems as there will then be no\nneed for Union meetings.\nIn a letter this week Mr. White objects\nto fay not presenting 'the case against\nN.U.S. So far Mr. Cox has not presented\nthe case for N.U.S., but has mentioned\nit in connection with many other topics,\nhence my remark in the last issue. As\nthis topic was dragged through this paper\nall last year I do not think that the majority of Union members want to go through\nit all again.\nCOUNTER-COUNTER-COMMENT.\nby W.C. Urlingham\nRe Mr. R.T.L. Fotheringham's sixth\nparagraph, I would like to propose Mr.\nCox and Mr. Fotheringham as joint Union\ndemagogues. This is not because I cac\nconvince myself that these two fit\nCassell's definition, although they could\nfit the definition given in the New English\nDictionary. For those who specialise in\nusing irrelevant information on strengthen\ntheir arguments may I add that this dictionary is published by Odhams Press Ltd.?\nIt is the fate of the Union demagogues\nwhich makes me propose these two. For\nthe past two terms I have had to read\nCox and Fotheringham roughly three\ntimes per issue: at least twice during the\nproduction of this newspaper and once\nwhen it's finally printed. I am sure that\nmost of our readers are sick and tired of\nreading Cox's diatribes and Fotheringham's counter-diatribes (reach for your diction-aries, folks) and would prefer anything\ninstead.\nPerhaps Jim Carter would stop writing\npassionate rubbish and give us a griping\naccount of the Little Harwood clog-dan c ing contest, to fill the space.\nThis is definitely the first, only, and\nlast counter-counter-comment.\nSOCIALISM V by D. Finney.\nAs there seem to be many in I.C. who\nforever sing the song 'free for all' and\n'private enterprise and yet seldom find\ncourage to attend Socialist Society meetings where they might hear the other case\nand propose their own, I intend to bring\nthe case for socialism to their bedsides\nvia 'Felix'. Essentially, socialism stands\nfor the generous impulses in man. A socialist exists for the well being of all its\nmembers, not just a few priv el edged ones.\nThe belief that the generous impulses in\nmen can be made dominant is based on\nthe assumption that if man's environment\n;\ns changed then he will change with it.\nThat this premise is true is probably the\nfirst concrete discovery of modern ph sy choi ogi 'cal and sociological research, although it was first argued by Godwin in\n1793.\nIf we are to change society, then our\nfirst step is to analyse its characteristics\nand find out which aspects inhibit our\nbetter side. In Britain today, the obvious\nfocal point of society is our material wellbeing which is a product of our economical system, termed 'capitalist' because\nit relies for its impetus on the private\nprofit motive. Its justification is that\nwithout the private profit motive our economy will run down through lack of in-centi ve. Certainly there must be an incentive behind every human endeavour,\nbut I find no evidence to suggest that\ncapitalism is the only or most efficient\nsource of this vital commodity. Indeed,\nI hope to show that what incentive capitalism does provide is erratic, cruel and\nselfish.\nThe second major discovery of the new\nsciences'\" is that we are all preoccupied\nwith our individual security. In our present industrial society this is largely synonymous with material security. It is\ntherefore to be expected that the bus i, ness man always choses the most profitable course of action, regard les of repercussions In any other branch of the\neconomy. He is not to be blamed for this ;\nhe is merely being a 'good' and 'efficient'\ncapitalist. Unfortunately, in a pure free\nmarket economy, cons pico us for its complete absence of controls such decisions\nlead to a state of false priorities. This\nis largely the face of Britain today; a land of mistaken, un-coordinated choices.\nTo give only a few examples, we spend\n\u00a3670 millions a year on education; compared with \u00a3400 millions on per nico us advertising ; exploitation. We begrudge\n\u00a3700 million on Health Service when our\nhospitals so obviously need rebuilding; the\npresent rate of hospital construction is\nless than its ever been for a hundred\nyears! My wife struggles in an overworked\nalm one r s<$ep a rfc ment attempting to obtain places in bulging old peoples' homes\nand mental hospitals and yet we are told\n\"we've never had it so good.\" Perhaps\nthis means that \u00a3500 M. spent on packaging is a good thing. The *Times \\ 12th May 1958. announces a new bank in Piccadilly: \"the interior decoration incorporates red marble quarried in Oran, ebony\nblack granite from Sweden, Italian glass\nmosaic, Delabole grey and Italian slate\nand...\" There will be no black granite for\nthe hospitals. Use it to attract a casual\ncustomer to the bank and forget the wor-ried\" mothers waiting five hours in the\nout-patient department.\nWith this environment no wonder we\nfind little time to consider our dormant\ngenerous impulses. As runners in a callous\nrat race if we stop for a moment to consider a crying child then we're trodden on*\nfrom behind; we've no time to be human.\nI would submit that a change in emphasis\nis urgently needed.\nAlthough capitalism may thrive on ex-plo it ation, this is not nec ess a rly its worst\nas nec t. What is really frightening is the\n'retreat from government.' The primacy\nof private interests over public never as-sert ed. It simply materialise s. No individual actually decides that social needs\nare to be sacrificed for private brass; it\njust happens, a consequence of impersonal\nun control able 'market forces'.\nThis process will sooner or later have\nto be revised. I hope in my next article\nto suggest how,by injecting socialism,\nthis drifting can replaced by determined\nprogress towards a more wholesome life\nVOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA.\n\"TO BE OR NOT TO BE?\"\na talk by\nLORD CHORLEY\narranged by the Huxley Socity.\n5.40 p.m. Tuesday 2S th February\nChem.Eng.
