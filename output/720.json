    "content": "The whole carnival kicks\noff in typical IC style with\nthe RCS Beer Festival on\nWednesday. Starting at\nnoon in the SCR before\nlectures have even finished\nfor the day, this event will\nshowcase various types of\nbeer from far afield.\nAssuming you survive\nWednesday's assault on the\ndigestive and nervous\nsystems, then Thursday\nbring its own attack on the\nvisual and auditory systems\ninstead, in the form of the\nRCS Smoking Concert.\nThis show is best described\nas a cross between Live Aid\nand the Wheeltappers' and\nShunters' Club. The\npatience and dedication of\nthe performers is nothing\ncompared with the patience\nand dedication of the\naudience. It takes place at\n7.00pm in the Union\nConcert Hall.\nRight, you can take your\near plugs out now.I said\nyou can take your ear\nplugs out! Thank you.\nWith the passing of the\nSmoking Concert comes\nFriday, and ignoring small\ninconveniences like\nlectures, at lunchtime the\nAerosoc Darts Tournament.\nTaking place at the top of\nthe Union Building you can\nfire your prototype origami\nwarheads into Beit Quad\nwhich doubtless have been\nconstructed in the\nmornings' lectures.\nThis is followed in the\nevening by the Rag and\nDrag Disco. No prizes for\nguessing what this one's about; starting at 7.00pm in\nthat den of corruption, the\nHolland Club. Turn up in\ndrag and you might get a few laughs if nothing else.\nBut at least it's a legitimate\nexcuse for getting in to\n\"mummy's\" clothes.\nAfter all this, it is\nprobably unlikely that you\nwill be able to get up next\nmorning\u2014but if you live in\nSouthside it may be\ndifficult to avoid, since\nRCSU will be meeting\ndirectly underneath. Along\nwith the other CC Us at\ntheir respective offices,\nStrange things happen at\nthe Beer Festival.\nthey are gathering for the\nRag Week 24-Hour Street\nCollection. If you stand\naround one of the C CU offices you will be given a mandate to go out and\nwreak havoc around\nLondon, hassling Joe\nPublic for money, armed\nonly with your collecting\ncan and a month's supply\nof Rag Mags. Or if you\nprefer more direct sales\ntechniques a machete. Be\nthere or be cuboid.\nIn the evening is SCAB Night. Nothing to do with\nblack leg labour or Bubonic\nPlague, this is where the\nvarious societies in the\nSocial, Cultural and\nAmusements board show\noff their wares. Opsoc for a change have not found\nsome piece of Gilbert and\nSullivan to carve up,\ninstead they are performing\ntheir \"Horrortorio\" while\nDramsoc will stage a \"Ripping Yarn\" and\ngenerally act coarsely.\nDebsoc are presenting a balloon debate and we are\nassured that Jesus Christ\nwill be returning for the\nevent. There will also be a Trombone Trio, various\nbands and a showing of\nthat film made for the\nresidents of Bernard\nSunley, National\nLampoon's Animal House\nOn Sunday you might\nhave thought that you\nwould be allowed to get\nsome sleep for a change,\nbut it is not to be. For at\nthat unsociable time of\n10.00am the CCUs are\nholding a Tug'o 'War in\nPrinces Gardens. Not\ncontent with that, they\nsuddenly rush off to the\nSerpentine to climb onto\nstrange artifacts\n\u2022 constructed from lumps of\npolystyrene and old\npacking cases. These then\nproceed to sink gracefully\nbeneath the waters, while\nthe Execs mounted atop\npaddle vainly to the other\nside. Called a Raft Race it\noften resembles more the\nharbour at Scapa Floe. The\nraft construction is\ngenerally left to each CCUs\nTransport Officer, who is\npresumably burnt at the\nstake afterwards.\nThe Film Night follows in\nthe evening, in the Concert\nHall at 7.00pm. The weekend dutifully\nends; it's a new week, and\nfollowing whatever form of\ntorture your department\nchooses to inflict on you\non Mondays, is the\nchallenge to Drink A Pub\nDry\u2014or least drink it\nslightly damp. Meet in the\nUnion Bar, perform a lighting raid on a less than\nwell-stocked pub, and\nmake a landlord very\nhappy.\nUnwelcome, though it\nmay be, Tuesday arrives.\nHopefully you have bought\nin enough coffee to cope\nwith the after effects of\nstripping a pub. At night is\nthe RSM Dirty Disco. It is\ntime to dust off your dirty\nold macs to meet all those\nrather mature looking\nschoolgirls.\nWedneday is Morphy\nDay. This annual event has\nthe strangest effect on ICU\nSabbaticals. The present\nExec is believed to suffer\nfrom a rare syndrome\nknown to the medical\nprofession as Tinnitus\nMorphii', the symptoms of\nwhich are an acute ringing\nin the ears when ever the\nwords 'Morphy Day' are\nmentioned thus causing\nany discussion on the\nmatter to be unheard.\nHowever this is nothing to\nprevious years where'\nParanoius Morphy' took\nhold of the Exec, resulting\nin a lightning ban on the\nwhole event.\nWhy should this event\ncause such strange\ndiseases? Why should a memorial to the Morphy in\nMorphy Richards be so\ncontroversial? It's simple\nwhen you think about it,\nand the residents of Putney\noften do. Basically the\nwhole thing revolves\naround a large piece of\nwood called the Morphy\nOar.\nIn principle the battle for\nthe Oar is a boat race\nalong the Thames from\nPutney Bridge between the\nthree CCUs. However once\nthe race begins, a raging\nbattle ensues for the oar,\nwhich remains on land. The\nweapons of war tend to be\nbuckets of rotting fish and\ngeneral refuse thrown in a vicious three way battle.\nAfter all this, when\nsomebody finally rides off\nwith the Oar in their van,\neverybody trips down to\nHarrods for the famous tea,\nsmelling of excrement,\nrotting vegetables and\nvarious other noxious\nsubstances. Needless to\nsay, they generally get\nthrown out.\nThe evening brings a reconciliation bar night in\nthe Union Bar starting at\n7pm, where, hopefully\neveryone will have had a shower first. If you don't know what a Barnight\nconstitutes yet, then you've\nprobably had your head\nburied in what got thrown\naround earlier today.\nFollowing the bar night is\nthe Idiosyncratic Event; so\ncalled because nobody\nknows what it is going to\nbe\nAlongside in the Union\nSnack Bar at 7.00pm also is\nthe RSM Ragarama.\nNobody seems to know\nwhat this is either, although\nwe have been assured that\nit is not Hon Porn Night\nunder a different guise.\nIf you like leaping about\nwith a finger stuck in your\near whenever somebody\nmentions \"pilchards\", then\nyou're an obvious victim of\nMartin S Taylor and his\nHypnosis demonstration\nstarting at 7.30pm in the\nGreat Hall.\nLectures have finished\nagain for the week, but the\nOne Million and One Darts\nCompetition is just\nbeginning. Will it ever end?\nThere is only one way to\nmake sure, go down to\nSouthside and throw some\ndarts ... before going to the\nGuilds Carnival.\nMisty in Roots and Attila\nThe Stockbroker return to\nImperial College in a night\nof entertainment in the\nUnion Building. It's just like\nthe Freshers' Ball, except\nfor a change you might\neven know somebody\nthere.\nSaturday heralds the end\nof Rag Week, but starting\nearly in the morning is\nCharles Brereton playing\nan upright piano for charity\ninto the not so small hours\nof Sunday morning. He is\nperforming in one of the\nCommitee Rooms at the\ntop of the Union Building.\nAlso starting on Saturday\nmorning is the InterHall/House Street\nCollection. Your Hall\nCommitee should be telling\nyou all about the weird\nthings they are organising\nfor it-if not find out why.\nBut Rag Week is rounded\noff by the Cocktails served\nin Southside Bar in the\nevening, and so for another\nyear the Week slowly winks\nout of existence,ready to\nstart again, same time,\nsame place, next year.\n\"A Fiver? Where?\" Weird scenes on Morphy Day.\nwho are those masked men?\nThe Guilds Hit Squad is one the most feared\norganisations in college. No-one knows when, where or\nhow they will strike next. Contract Flanners, they are\nentirely without pity or compassion for their victims.\nIf you go to the Beer Festival on Wednesday you may\nnotice a group of strangely dressed people. Clad in a range of d is g uses, generally consisting of lab-coats, safety\nglasses and various other accoutrements, they quickly\nspring into action. Spraying shaving foam onto paper\nplates, they silently select random targets and then\ngratuitously \"flan\" them. There is no escape.\nThis is the first official Hit of the year; but there will be\nmore. From now on, all hits will be of the contract variety.\nYou can pay to have friends and enemies flan ned at the\nmost em barra sing times possible-but only if the price is\nright. Even lecturers are not immune - once they give their\nconsent they usually end up with considerably more than\negg on their faces.\nNeedless to say, the Squad does give rise to cheap\nimitations; however there is nothing quite like the real\nthing, since all the money raised from contracts goes to\nthe various Rag Charities.\nIf you wear contact lenses, then you can get badges\nfrom the Union Office which will give a special\ndispensation from normal fl anning: but don't expect to get\nimmunity-they will just find somewhere else to flan you.\nrag record\nBill Bailey is trying to start his own record company up.\nThe first single has just been released, which apparently is\nBritain's first ever \"Go-Go Rap\", or something like that. He\nis selling 50 copies of the record for \"3.00 each; the profits\nfrom which go to Rag. Unfortunately you may not be able\nto get to hear it first, since IC Radio are not playing it. If\nyou are interested then copies are available from the\nUnion Office. The man himself can be found via Petrology\nI. "

    "content": "Union Planning Group\nUnion President, Carl\nBurgess, presented the\ndocument that outlines how\nthe Union should set about\ntaking over the Union Bar\nto College House\nCommitee on Wednesday.\nThis document is\namazingly vague. It ignores\nthe administrative and the\nfinancial problems\nassociated with the\ntakeover. For example, the\nUnion Bar floor needs\nreplacing in a year. This\nmay cost as much as\ntwenty thousand pounds. If\nthe Union is to pay for this\nin the first year of\noperation, it may have\nsevere problems finding the\nmoney. Carl claims that\nyou can't lose money on a bar. Perhaps he should\nconsult South Bank Poly\nwho manage to do this\nregularly.\nCarl called a Union\nPlanning Group meeting.\nHe attempted to hide the\ndiscussion document from\nthem saying it wasn't important. He attempted to\nprevent FELIX printing\ndetails of it after John\nSmith had contacted him.\n(Incidently, despite Carl's claims at the U GM that he\nonly had the document two\ndays before the Union\nPlanning Group, FELIX got\na copy a week and a half\nearlier). The Union\nPlanning Group, which\nincluded many of the\nUnion's senior non-sabbatical officers,\nmanaged to persuade Carl\nto amend the discussion\ndocument. They attempted\nto tighten it up. Carl has\nnow changed his mind. In\nprivate he says it was\nbecause College\nadministrators persuaded\nhim the amendments were\na bad idea.\nCarl himself recognises\nsome of the snags\nassociated with taking over\nthe Bar. I quote from one\nof the documents\npresented to Union\nPlanning Group: 'The\nUnion Bar floor has\nrecently undergone its last\nsanding, it will need to be\nreplaced in the next two\nyears. This will cost a lot of\nmoney that should have\nbeen earmarked by the bar\ncommittee several years\nago, hopefully this has\nbeen done and so we will\nnot have to pay for it. I shall speak to the College\nSecretary about this\nmatter'. Perhaps Carl\nshould have asked John\nSmith before he agreed to\ntake control on January 1.\nMany Union Officers are\nworried about what will\nhappen if the Union Bar\nloses money. Carl told\nthem that he thought\nCollege would bail the\nUnion out if the Bar lost\nmoney. Unfortunately,\nwhen Carl presented the\ntakeover document on\nWednesday, Financial\nSecretary, Brian Lloyd\nDavies, said there was no\nthe students are given an\nopportunity to discuss the\nissues.\nSherry\nAt 8pm on Monday evening\nguests at the Union sherry\nparty were told there was\nno more sherry even\nthough there were at least\nfifty bottles in Dave\nKingston's office. This\nway College could help the\nUnion if the Bar lost\nmoney.\nAlmost everyone wants\nus to gain control of the\nBar. However the Union\nmust ensure that it gets a reasonable deal. We mus n't be rushed into getting the\nBar. When the Union\nRefectory was taken over\nby the Union it took about\nsix months of planning.\nCarl seems to think we can\ntake over a bar in two\nweeks.\nThe Union should plan a management system for the\nBar. Does anyone know\nwhether we can cope\nwithout a financial advisor?\nThe Union should examine\nother union run bars. The\nUnion also needs to\nexamine the financial\nproblems associated with\nthe Bar. It needs to find\nwhere the money for\nreplacing the floor of the\nBar can come from. It\nneeds to ask College how\nmuch it will be expected to\npay for overheads such as\ncleaning.\nAfter years of College\ncontrol, an extra few\nmonths before the takeover\nwould make little\ndifference, and avoid the\nrisk of the takeover causing\nsevere problems.\nUGM\nTuesday's UGM was a farce. There were several\nimportant issues for\ndiscussion. Obviously, the\ntakeover of the Union Bar\nneeded full discussion. It is\nthe most serious thing the\nUnion has done in several\nyears. The Union could\nlose thousands of pounds\non a badly managed bar.\nUGM Chairman, Chris\nHendy, allowed the meeting\nto degenerate into a shouting match where\nnormal discussion was\nimpossible. Chris should be\nimpartial, not make fun of\nspeakers from the chair.\nFor many students the\nUGM is their only real\nopportunity to question\nsabbaticals' action. Chris\nHendy should ensure that\nmeans the Union was left\nwith over \u00a3100 worth of\nsherry. Maybe it was\nreturned to the suppliers. I doubt it. I guess it has been\nused to keep the Union\nOffice stocked up for the\nrest of the year. The Union\nOffice argue that it is in the\nUnion's interest to put on a sherry party to meet people\nfrom College. Why is it in\nthe Union's interests to buy\na year's supply of sherry?\nSabbaticals\nThe Union is being run\nincompetently. Carl has\nmanaged to risk wasting\n\u00a31500 by banning the Rag\nMag after he had the\nopportunity to censor it. He\nhas risked ruining our\ntakeover of the bar with\ninsufficient planning. On\nTuesday he had a meeting\nwith College Secretary,\nJohn Smith, pissed out of\nhis brains. If that doesn't damage our relations\nnothing will.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed by the Union Print\nUnit, Imperial College.

They play far\ntoo much middle of the\nroad music; banal chart-hyped pop, interspersed\nwith American-style adult\norientated rock music. The\npresenters try too hard at\nbeing slick, 'have a nice\nday' disc jockeys as if\npractising for a job on a small town local radio\nstation.\nI have only heard three\nshows which go even halfway to breaking the mould;\nthe John Burgess show, a Wednesday evening show\nby an American girl who\nactually sounds like a natural DJ and the 'William\nand Paul Show' which\noffended Mr White so\nmuch. Admittedly the\n'idiotic banter' he\ncomplains about would\nappeal best to members of\nQT Soc but at least the\nshow has spontaneity.\nOther presenters should\ntake note that most of their\nlisteners are in fact\nyounger than forty. We\ndon't all want to hear more\nmusic and we don't always\nwant 'a useful and\ninformative service'.\nPerhaps I am in a minority\nof people who like to hear\na more varied selection of\nmusic than is usually\nplayed but minorities need\nto be catered for and in any\ncase IC Radio needs shows\nlike these to at least\nprovide a germ of variety.\nYours sincerely\nA Weston\n2 Friday 8 November FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Rugby\nKent Univ 2nd3 IC 14\nIf Ron Atkinson thinks he\nhas injury worries he\nshould join the IC 2nd team; resources were\nstretched to the point\nwhere the wingers\nconsisted of a limping lock\nforward and a horrendously\nherpes-ridden prop!\nMoreover with a mixed start\nto the season, everybody\nknew that a victory was\nessential to prevent the\nseason sinking into\nmediocrity.\nDuring the first half IC's pack began to assert\nthemselves, and the steady\nstream of possession was\nused to good advantage by\nthe half-backs. It therefore\ncame as no surprise when\nafter a searing run by\nSimon Denyer, the full-back, Roy, scored a try.\nLater following sustained\npressure by the forwards,\nAndy Coope added another\ntry to make the score 8-3 at\nhalf time.\nThe second half\nperformance was even\nmore convincing, with the\npack ably led by 'Baboon'\nDowning totally dominating\nthe opposition, whilst the\nbacks continued to be solid\nin defence.

Norman wishes it\nto be known that he is\n's hacked up' with Julie his\nassistant. On going to print\nwe could not confirm the\ntruth of the above (what's new!), but it can be\nrevealed that this story\ncame straight from the\nmouth of the man himself\nto our illustrious editor at\nthe famed gathering of IC\nglitter at i, the Council\nSherry Party. This is\nnormally target number one\nfor all tii e Union's resident\nfreebie hunters eager to\ndrink our money. However\non this occasion one guest\nactually paid for the\ndubious privilege of\nattending. Gallant (thick o?) Hugh Southey in fact paid\n\u00a33 to rag. What's more,\nsherry consumption was\napparently carefully\nrestrained by blundering\nDP Dave Kingston who was\nseen to hide at least 39\nbottles in his office and\nthen declared that supplies\nhad run out. Eager blunder\nwatchers are keen to see\nwhat sort of faux pas Dave\ncan accomplish with the\nbottles. Surely he won't get\nplastered out of his brains\njust before a visit from\nSherfield supremo John\nSmith, like Carl Burgess\ndid on Tuesday.\nBut to return to Dave, we\ncan report a couple of\nrecent minor blunders. On\nthe room bills sent out by\nstudent services this year\nthere is a \u00a315 late payment\nsurcharge. And who lost\nthe bills so that the Union\nalmost had to pay the\nsurcharge, you've guessed\nit. The second minor\nboo boo was discovered by\nscab and Dramsoc hitman\nNick Shackley who noticed\nthat the minutes sent out in\npreparation for the Union\nFinance Committee by\ngorm less Dave were infact\nthose from a pre vous year.\nDave, as is his habit,\nimmediately insisted the\nerror was not his, only Nick\nhad the wrong minutes.\nHowever on checking the\nrelevant pigeon holes the\nenormity of the true error\nwas exposed. Dave has yet\nto make the really big error\nwhich some hacks seem to\nthink will lead him being no\nconfidence d. Perhaps this\nis because the only really\nbig things Dave has\nmanaged to get involved\nwith are women. It is nice\nto see our DP's welfare\nbeing looked after, and\nwho better than IC Welfare\nAdviser Lesley Gillingham,\nseen with the short two-dimensional one at the\nabove sherry party.\nAlso seen getting\ninvolved with women at the\nparty were rotund Hon Sec\nQuentin Banana and\nSTOIC big head Alan Rose\nboth of whom were seen to\ntry a patronising real man\napproach. Unfortunately,\nfor our two heroes the\nAmerican they both chose\nto force their attentions on\nfelt more moved towards\n'duff ing them up' than to\nanything romantic.\nFinally, in case you\nhaven't noticed, Union Spy\nDave Parry now work ng in\nStudent services has been\nsporting a rather novel\nhairdo. Infact in the small\nhours of Monday it was\nextremely weird, due to the\nfact that Dave and RCS wrap around fresher Penny,\nwho cut it, were both under\nthe influence of alcohol.\nRemember, just because\nit's cheap doesn't mean it's any good.\nAnnouncements\n\u2022Surf Club leaving 5.00pm Beit Arch,\nplease bring scone recipes.\n\u2022If you lost a jumper or penknife at\nlast Wednesday's Indsoc Careers Fair\ncontact David Green, Me ch Eng 3,\nwith description.\n\u2022Fremantle Hotel, RIP sadly missed\nby friends and close associates in\nPutney, Tooting, Tottenham Court\nand Kensington.

These\ntales exude the\ncharacteristics of Victorian\nValues; snobbishness,\nprudery, greed, arrogance\nand petty moral ising, to a marked degree. If you want\nthe real thing it may be\nbetter to go for Conan\n^ v^ \u2022\nSH FR LOCK HOi WS late Victorian London; the\nsmog s, the murders,\nHackney Carriages and\nTurkish baths. There are a few gems however such as\nthe adventures of 'the\nUnique Hamlet', 'the\nMarked Man' and 'the\nDoyle's books, which are\npublished by every major\npublisher and available in\nmost bookshops. A good\ncross-section of stories is\nprinted in 'Selected Stories'\n(published by Oxford, price\n\u00a31.95).\nKiri Guide to Lunchtime\nLondon\nCentral London's500 best\ncafes and sandwich bars\n\u00a32.50 in cl p&p from:\nDistribution Dept\nThe Deighton Consultancy\n5 Langley Street\nLondon WC2H 9J A The guide mainly covers the\narea enclosed by the circle\nline. Since it is sponsored by\nKiri ('a sparkling apple juice'),\nthere are eighty pages trying\nto persuade one to buy Kiri\nwith recipes for keen cooks.\nThe book is divided into\nsections according to postal\ndistrict with maps. The layout\nis very good\u2014an easy book\nto use. Unless one is a 'cafe-crawl er' its usefulness seems\nrather doubtful, as most\npeople do not wish to venture|\ntoo far during their\nlunch hour, and tend to find a favourite haunt very quickly.\nMaybe the Haldane should\ninvest in a copy.\nSarah\nKirk\nSherlock Holmes' career began in 'A Study In Scarlet'\nwhere he met up with Dr Watson. Despite his creator's efforts to kill him off in 'The Final Problem', when he was\nbelieved to fall to his death over the Reichenbach Falls\nwhilst clutching his arch-enemy, Moriarty, he was\nresurrected. In The Empty House', about the murder of a games ter, he meets up with his Watson again, and due to\npublic pressure, another three collections of stories were\nwritten: The Return of Sherlock Holmes', 'The Last Bow'\nand 'The Casebook'.\nIf you thought that the\nRoyal Shakespeare\nCompany always produced\nwholesome, well-mannered\nplays in a wholesome, well-mannered style, then think\nagain. The author of this\nplay does not mince words\n- any writer attempting to\ndeal with the relationship\nbetween sexuality and\npolitics could not afford to\n- and this production does\nnot pull any punches\nUngratuitous nudity?\neither. Nudity and 'bad'\nlanguage feature\nprominently, but here they\nare not gratuitous. Barker's main strength is his\nrealistic dialogue, which is\ntotally convincing, from the\nvulgar cynicism of the\nveteran soldier to the\nclipped economy of speech\nof the Old Etonian.\nThe action takes place in\na remote British colony,\nwhere the leisurely routine\nis upset by the arrival of a government spy, an\nentrepreneur, three\nprostitutes and a magician.\nA rebellion follows\nTHEATRE\n(appropriately enough, led\nby the magician), and leads\nto the formation of Utopia\n\u2014 the New England.\nImperialism is savagely\nBrave New World\ncaricatured, with the\nportrayal of a governor\npretending to be ga-ga, his\nsex-mad daughter (who\nrealises her sexual\nmonopoly has been ended\nby by the arrival of the\nwhores when her\nunderwear is no longer\nstolen), two pillars of the\nestablishment (ex-public\nschool, of course) sent to\nrestore order, and a government official who\nmisses his mother.\nLawrence of Arabia even\nmanages to put in an\nappearance as a gay\nprivate.\nAs one would expect\nfrom the RSC the acting is\nexcellent, with strong\nperformances from Maggie\nSteed as the Governor's daughter (a sort of sexually\ndemented Joyce Grenfell,\nas City Limits put it) and\nPaul Freeman as the\nmagician. Having seating\non two sides of The Pit\nmanages to capture the\natmosphere of 'in the\nround' theatre while\navoiding some of the\ndrawbacks.\n'Crimes in Hot Countries'\nis extremely funny, but it is\na happy play \u2014 or even\noptimistic. Barker's view of\nlife and humanity is a grotesque one if his\npaintings are anything to\ngo by, and you will emerge\nfrom this play at best\nbemused; at worst,\nbewildered. Nevertheless, it\nis well worth seeing, if only\nto enjoy a bit of Empirebashing to counter the\nrecent wave of 'those\nglorious days in India'\nnostalgia.\nCharlie Troup\nRoyal College of Science\nAssociation\nCareers Forum\nMeet and discuss on a one to one basis careers in all\nfields of Industry, Commerce, Banking, Insurance, about\nlife after graduation.

No thanks go to\nteam f loos ie, Jackie.\nIC 1sts4 Charing X0 IC bounced back from\nWednesday UAU\ndisappointments to score a convincing 4-0 victory. An\nexcellent team performance\nwas the cornerstone of the\n\u2022 result with IC's defence of\nMartin Bradley, Laurence\nCovill, Rob Clarke and\nBryce Goldsbrough\noutstanding, keeper Nick\nTarn only having one shot\nto save during the game.\nPraise must also go to\nthe IC forwards, Guy\nPoppy and Dave Lynne for\ntheir tireless running\ncausing three CXWM\ndefence to make several\nmistakes.\nIC's first came midway\nthrough the first-half from a Paul Bravery shot from 12\nyards. The second came\nfrom a through ball from\nAlex Lunghi which found\nDave Lynne who beat the\nadvancing keeper from a narrow angle. Midway\nthrough the second half IC\nadded a third when Paul\nBravery latched onto a bad\ngoal-kick and beat the\nkeeper with a fierce drive\nfrom the edge of the box.\nThe fourth came in the\nclosing minutes when the\nCXWM Keeper failed to\nhold onto a shot, leaving\nShaun Thomas with a simple tap in from 3 yards.\nKent 1sts6 IC 1sts0 Just to prove that we don't just report the good\nperformances, last\nWednesday we went, we\nplayed and we got stuffed.\nBut seriously though, IC\ncame up against a very\norganised and fit (and big!)\nKent team who showed IC\nthe value of having a full\ntime trainer.\nThree goals in the first 15\nminutes gave Kent a flying\nstart from which IC never\nreally recovered. One goal\ncoming from a long throw,\nand two from corners.\nAfter this IC woke up and\ngradually brought\nthemselves back in to the\ngame and should have\npulled one back when the\nKent keeper failed to hold a Paul Bravery free kick but\nAlex Lunghi failed to\nconvert the rebound.\nThe game remained even,\nuntil the last 15 minutes\nwhen Kent's superior\nfitness began to tell,\nscoring three late goals to\ngive a score line which\nflattered the opposition.\n16 Friday 8 November FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "College Gives Go-ahead for Bar Take-over\nYou Can Have It\nIC Union will begin a phased takeover of the Union bar\non January 1 1986. Proposals outlined in a joint paper by\nCollege Secretary John Smith and Union President Carl\nBurgess were approved at the meeting of House\nCommittee on Wednesday.\nThe paper was submitted\nwithout any alterations to the\noriginal draft copy written by Mr\nSmith. This was sent to Mr\nBurgess for his approval, as\nreported in FELIX on 25\nOctober. Mr Burgess arranged\nthe inaugural meeting of the\nUnion Planning Group on\nThursday October 31, at which\nthe proposals for the bar\ntakeover were discussed.\nSeveral senior non-sabbatical\nUnion officers who were\npresent expressed concern over\nthe wording of the draft\ndocument and advised changes.\nMr Burgess appeared to agree\nto these suggestions and he\nwas expected to have amended\nthe document prior to\nWednesday's House Committee.\nWhen the matter was discussed\nat the UGM on Tuesday, Mr\nBurgess revealed that he had\nchosen not to implement any of\nthe recommended changes.\nMr Burgess was criticised\nfrom the floor for not making\nany mention of the takeover\nproposals, and specifically Mr\nSmith's draft paper, in his report\nto the U GM. Mr Burgess\nclaimed that he had only had\nthe draft in his possession for\ntwo days before writing his\nreport: he did not include\nSaturday and Sunday. After an\nobjection the President's report\nwas passed by a narrow\nmajority.\nMr Burgess and Deputy\nPresident Dave Kingston were\ninterviewed by FELIX after the\nKingston: 'Phantom Fears'\nHouse Committee meeting on\nWednesday. Both expressed\ndisappointment in the general\nreaction to the moves to take\nover the bar. Mr Burgess\nstressed that the Union\nPlanning Group was only an\nadvisory body, and as such\ncould not decide Union policy.\nHe was disappointed that many\nstudents who attended had had\ntoo negative an attitude towards\nthe Union takeover. He felt that\nthe meeting had provided lots\nof questions but no answers,\nand the plans for the bar had\nnot been advanced. Mr\nKingston said that the fears\nwhich had been expressed were\njustifiable but were 'phantom\nfears'.\nMr Burgess and Mr Kingston\nfelt confident that the Union\nwould be ready to begin a takeover on January 1. They\nhad brought the matters raised\nat the meeting to the attention\nof College administration, and\nhad been assured that these\nwere not causes for concern.\nThey had also spoken at some\nlength with Mr Peter Anwyl,\nsenior administrator at ULU,\nwho has made several reports\non bar practice.\nMr Burgess added that he\nwas disappointed in the turnout\nat the Union Planning Group,\nand was unhappy that his\nnotice about the meeting had\nnot been printed in FELIX. He\nwas critical of the Editor, Hugh\nSouthey, and stressed that\nFELIX has a responsibility to\nthe Union. 'A Union notice is for\nthe FELIX Editor to publish' was\nhis comment.\nWhen questioned about his\nstatement that he had only had\nMr Smith's draft paper for two\ndays before the deadline for his\nU GM report, Mr Burgess said\nthat he had meant 'two days in\nwhich he had any spare time'.\nHe pointed out how many other\nthings he had to do, and how\nbusy Commemoration Day\nweek had been. He had only\nhad ten minutes to write his\nreport and had not thought of\nincluding the paper as part of\nthis.\nJohn Smith spoke to FELIX\nabout the takeover proposals\nlater on Wednesday. He said\n|\nBurgess: chose not to implement\nchanges\nthat he and Mr Burgess still had\nto discuss many of the details\nbefore the phased takeover\nbegan. He said that it was\nexpected that the Union would\ntake financial responsibility for\nthe bar as of January 1, but that\nMr Iwen Thomas and Mr Rob\nNorthey, the current licensees,\nwould still be involved in the\nmanagement organisation. He\nfelt that it would be wisest for\nthe Union to obtain a corporate\nlegal identity, in order to get a liquor license, rather than to\napply for a club license. He\nthought that it would be 'easier\nfor the Union to fight its own\nbattles' if it were legally\nseparate from the College.\nUnion Bar\nTrashed\nThe Union Bar was vandalised\nsometime on Monday night. The\ndamage was discovered at\nabout 8.30am Tuesday morning\nwhen acting bar manager Dave\nBrennan arrived to open the Bar\nfor a stock check. The police\nwere called and arrived at about\n10.30am. Refectory Manager Rob\nNorthey told FELIX that the cost\nof the damage had been initially\nassessed at \u00a3800 but declined\nto comment further. Head of\nCollege security, Geoff Reeves,\nlater stated that the matter was\nin the hands of the police who\nhad questioned a man in\nconnection with the enquiries.\nAt Tuesday'sU GM Carl\nBurgess warned that when the\nvandals were caught, they\nwould oe prosecuted and\nthrown out of College.\nFree Friday 8 November No 720\n\n"

At\nlunchtime, within sight of\nthe inn, the decision was\nmade to miss out the\nmiddle peak through lack\nof time. Amply refreshed,\nwe ascended the NorthEast ridge of Ingleborough\nthen descended the five\nmiles back to the van. The\nthree peaks walk, which\nascends almost 6000 feet\nand crosses 23 miles of\nsome of the best limestone\nscenery in the country, is\nan excellent introduction to\nhill walking if you relish\npeat bogs and are\nreasonably fit.\nQT\nWhich Imperial College\nSociety was recently\ndescribed by the Bishop of\nDurham as 'about as much\nuse to humanity as a musical condom'?

    "content": "Education Minister Defends Capitalism\n1 Joseph Sings The Blues Sir Keith Joseph, Secretary\nof State for Education and\nScience, was accorded a mixed reception when he\nspoke to a packed Great\nHall at a Conservative\nSociety meeting yesterday.\nOver 500 students attended\nthe meeting, including a large number who had\njoined the IC Socialist\nSociety demonstration\noutside the Great Hall\nbefore Sir Keith arrived.\nIn his initial address, Sir\nKeith chose to avoid the\ngovernment's education\npolicies and spoke instead\nabout the justifications'for\na capitalist economy. He\ndescribed capitalism as 'the\ndecentralisation of\nownership and decision-making' which was\nmotivated by the pursuit of\nprofit. The moral\njustification for this, he\ncontinued, was that it\nresulted in increased\nprosperity. He agreed that\ncapitalism had many faults\nbut called it 'the least bad\nsystem yet invented',\nadding that 'economic\nfreedom is the basis of\npolitical freedom'.\nSir Keith said that Britain\nwas now a relatively poor\ncountry in comparison with\nthe rest of Europe, and that\nthe underlying reason for\nthis was that productivity is\nlow. He felt that concern\nabout unemployment was\nvery sincere, but that very\nfew people put any thought\ninto how jobs could be\ncreated. Jobs, he said,\ncame from customers, and\nto attract customers a more\nstable trading base was\nneeded.\nWhen the meeting was\nopened to questions from\nthe floor, Sir Keith was\nasked why France, which\nhas a Socialist\nadministration, was more\nprosperous than Britain. He\nreplied that President\nMitterand's government\nwas now running a capitalist-based economy,\nand that France was\nbenefitting from 40 years of\ncapitalist rule.\nThe rest of the questions\nconcentrated on education\nissues. Socsoc chairman\nPete Hobbis asked if, in the\nlight of generous pay\nawards to senior civil\nservants, teachers should\nnot also be treated more\nfavourably. Sir Keith agreed\nand cited the \u00a31,200 million\noffer he had made to the\nteachers.\nSir Keith was sceptical\nwhen he was told that\nmany teachers today\nactively discouraged young\npeople from making a career in teaching. He said\nthat the real scandal in the\neducation system was that\none third of children left\nschool at the first\nopportunity, after 11 years\nof compulsory education\nfrom which they had had\nno apparent benefit. He\nsaid that British education\ndid not cope well with\nchildren of lower abilities.\nThis was partly due to an\nobsolete curriculum and an\nout of date exam system,\nand to a small minority of\nparents who discouraged\ntheir children, but also to\nsub-standard teaching.

The article refers\nto research by a team of\nsolid-state physicists, led\nby Dr David Caplin of IC.\nThe research team\nrecorded an observation\nconsistent with the\npredicted behaviour of amon opole, the magnetic\nequivalent of an electron.\nThe article goes on to\nsay that tests are still under\nway to eliminate the\npossibility of other physical\neffects which can mimic amon opole signal.\nMonopoles are expected\nto be extremely rare in\nnature and are predicted in\nthe Grand Unified Theories.\nThis particular experiment\nwas not set up to find amon opole, but to put an\nupper limit on the dens is ty of these particles in the\nUniverse.\nDavid Caplin said the\narticle was misleading\nbecause, contrary to what\nwas said in the New\nScientist, they wouldn't be\nable to prove whether the\nsignal was amon opole or\nnot.\nBo Romps\nhome\nBoanerges, the famed\ninviolate mascot of City\nand Guilds Union,\ncompleted the Brighton run\nlast Sunday in her usual\ntime of just over four hours.\nTen Guildspeople, two of\nwhom were clad in py jma s, saw Bo off from the Northwest corner of the\nSerpentine at 8.20am with a feeble Boomalaka.\nHowever, about fifty people\nwere in Brighton to see Bo\nfinish at 12.30pm.

To say\nthat it was one-sided would\nbe a gross understatement.\nWhy were we being urged\nto participate in the\nSocialist Society's subversive and destructive\nactivities? Why were we not\nurged to go to the meeting\nand actually listen to what\nthe man had to say, so we\ncould make up our own\nminds about the subject of\neducation policy?\nI was even more\ndisgusted to find that the\nso-called 'picket' was\nincluded in the 'What's On'\nfeature. I might not have\nminded so much if it had\nbeen made totally clear that\nit had been organised by\nthe Socialist Soc, but it\nseems they don't want to\nown up to indulging in this\nsort of activity.

A common form of\ntorture is to suspend the\nvictim until consciousness\nis lost (often from hot water\npipes) and then repeat the\ntreatment.\nI would request that there\nshould be a higher general\nawareness of what happens\nin the outside world before\npeople make tasteless\nblunders like this.\nYours truly\nOliver Smart\nChairman\nIC Amnesty Group\nattempt to disrupt other\npeople's activities.\nOne final point.

    "content": "Jim Claydon looks\nat recent cinema\nreleases\nThe American market\naccounts for some 60-70% of\nthe total film revenue, and the\nmajority of the audience in\nthe States is aged between\n15-24. These facts were\nprobably responsible for the\nproduction of some recent\nreleases.\nStarting at the least\ncerebral and working\nupwards, albeit slightly, we\nhave Weird Science (Empiri\nLeicester Square. ABCs and\nlocals). Inspired by watching\na Frankenstein movie and by\ntheir lack of success with\ngirls, a couple of 15 year-old\nboys decide to create their\nideal women. They feed a home computer with pictures\nfrom Playboy and details of\nEinstein and correct the\nwhole thing up to a Barbiedoll. After some pathetic\njokes involving trying to\nchoose the breast size of\ntheir creation (perhaps the\nmakers were aiming their film\nat the un trapped1015 year\nold market) the Barbie-doll\nreappears as Kelly le Brock.\nGirlfriends.\nI'm afraid to have to report\nthat Ms le Brock probably\npossessed greater acting\na bil it iy before the transition,\nbut her heart's in the right\nplace as she tries hard to\nsupply the boys with\ngirlfriends of their own age.\nThere is one particularly\nenjoyable set piece early on\nwhen the two nervous\nyoungsters, accompanied by\nthe sophisticated Lisa, their\ncreation, go into the Harlem\nbar and here Antony Michael\nHall's not inconsiderable\ntalents are allowed almost\nfree reign. His friend, Ian\nMichael-Smith, is however\nnot quite so good and also\nbears a disturbing similarity\nto an old school friend of\nmine; still that's my problem.\nThe film also contains an\namusing cameo role in the\nform of a sadistic older\nbrother who is continually\nbeating up his sibling, 'a habit\nhe picked up at military\nacademy'. The whole thing\nwas fairly ably written and\ndirected by John Hughes,\nwho made the fairly\nintelligent Breakfast Club and\nshould know better. If you\nhave an 11 year old liking for\nbad taste jokes then this is\nthe film for you, but\notherwise I can't recommend\nit for fear that it might do well\nenough to promote a sequel,\nheaven help us.\nHeaven Help Us was the\nAmerican title for the film\nCatholic Boys (ABC Edgware\nRd, Classic Tottenham Ct Rd)\nand the film is better than\neither title might suggest,\nslightly.\nIt is a film full of\nstereotypes, a bright new kid,\nan intelligent lout much\nteased fat boy, a sex-crazed\nboy, a stupid, narcissistic lad,\na sadistic teacher, a benevolent headmaster, an a sympathetic trendy, new\nmaster. The well worn story\nof growing up is given a new\nlease of life by the good\nperformances by all the\ncharacters and the addition of\na poignant doomed love story\nbetween the entirely\nconvincing Andrew McCarthy\nand the independant Doris,\nMary Stuart Masterson.\nFrizzy Perm\nDonald Sutherland appears\nbriefly as the headmaster\nwhose small role consists\nmainly of looking benignly\ndown from his window at his\nboys from bene an th his\nrather obvious perm. The film\nhowever belongs to Andrew\nMcCarthy whose relaxed and\nnatural performance deserves\nto take him far.\nInterestingly enough it is\nAndrew McCarthy's cynical\nhack in St Elmo's Fire (Plaza\n2, Screen on the Green,\nClassic Chelsea) for whom I had the most sympathy. That\nhaving been said I really\ncouldn't get all that involved\nwith the middle class angst of\na group of 7 recent High\nSchool graduates. It is ironic\nthat the title refers to a phenomenon which appears\nto be more dramatic then it\nreally is, and this is how the\nfilm comes across.\nThe film is basically\nconcerned with the way in\nwhich a group of graduates\nadapt to life after college and\nthe way in which their\nfriendship changes under the\nsubsequent pressures. There\nis some excellent acting from\nthe attractive cast who\nobviously enjoy working\ntogether and who should all\ndo well (and already are), but\ntheir over-priv il edged characters failed to move me\nFake bars\nin this picture. And I am also\nsorry to have to report that I found the assets, of the bar\nparticular y, looked just like\nfilm sets and not at all real,\nshame.\nThis problem in a different\nguise is also a fault with the\notherwise excellent crafted\nPrizzi's Honour (Odeon\nHaymarket). It was disturbing\nto find that, in a movie where\nenormous attention was spent\non every detail, several\nsequences contained inter cut Major Photographic Exhibition Announced\nshots on not i cable different\nfilm stock. Apart from that\nJohn Huston's new film is\nclassically told, with standard\ntechniques, such as the use\nof shots of an aeroplane\nflying in the appropriate\ndirection every time someone\nmakes the transition from Los\nAngeles to New York or vice\nversa. Jack Nicholson\nbrilliantly portrays the rather\nslow-witted mafia hitman who\nMafia marriage\nfalls in love and subsequently\nmarries Kathleen Turner who,\nmuch to his surprise turns\nout to be in the same line of\nwork. Unfortunately she has\nrobbed the family and this\nleads Jack Nicholson to the\nconflict of loyalties hinted at\nby the title and hence the\nrather un classical ending.\nThe cast, including the 75\nyear old director's daughter\nAngelica, is excellent,\nparticularly the excellent\nKathleen Turner, and the\nscript for this black comedy\ncontains many sharp lines, a very worthwhile film.\nFinally, saving the best for\nlast, my favourite film of\nrecent releases is Mishima, A Life in Four Chapters\n(Lumiere, Electric Screen). It\ntells the story of one of Japan\ngreatest authors, he was\nnominated for the Nobel Prize\nthree times in a brilliantly\nclever form. Hampered by\ncondition imposed by\nMishima's widow, Paul\nSchrader has constructed a highly intelligent film. In fact\nMishima's fanatical\nnationalism, unashamed\nhomosexuality (toned down\nfor the film), and the final\nritual suicide in 1975 is still\nsuch a delicate point with the\nJapanese that the film was\nrecently hastily withdrawn\nfrom the Tokyo film festival\nafter pressure from right wing\ngroups.\nThe characters of the man\nare portrayed in four parts\nand in three different ways,\nthrough black and white\nflashbacks (whose character\nreflect a history of Japanese\ncinema) through theatrical\nadaptation of sections from\nfour of his stories; and the\nevents of his final day. This\nconfusing sounding mixture\nis so well handled that it\nnever seems'anything other\nthan wholly appropriate and\nis always easily accessible.\nPaul Schrader who wrote and\ndirected seems to have a fascination for the obsessive\nindividual and is on record as\nhaving said that had Mishima\nnot existed he would have\nhad to cr eat him.\nThe narcissism of Mishima\nis conveyed but repeated use\nof mirrors, both as used in\nthe shot in the film and also\nthroughout the script, for\nmirrors show what 'actors\nand homosexuals most fear',\nthemselves as they really are.\nIt is this obsession with self\nthat leads him into body\nbuilding and finally to suicide\nin or-der to avoid the\ndegradation with age, as a character from one of his\nnovels says, 'You must\ncommit suicide at the height\nof your beauty'. Slowly\nthrough this life he becomes\naware that in his quest for\npurity that you can only\n'reconcile art and actions by\ndeath'.\nJim Claydon\nA major photographic\naward was announced last\nweek by the Commonwealth\ninstitute, open to amateur and\nprofessional photographers\nalike and sponsored by the\nStandard Chartered Bank.\nThe 'Standard Chartered\nCommonwealth Photographic\nAward will be open to any\nperson who is currently a citizen of one of the forty\nconstituent Commonwealth\ncountries, photographing\nwithin their own or other\nCommonwealth country.\nTo enter you have to\npresent a portfolio of either\nsix black and white prints or\nsix colour prints or\ntransparencies, with the\ntheme of 'Life in the\nCommonwealth'.

One of Mr Turner's specialities in his stage act is\na mock rape act during a cover of 'The Crusher' from\nwhich you can gauge the\nartistic nature of the show.\nThe only other 'cover' they\nfeatured was their blistering\nversion of In The Mood,\nthrashed as you have never\nheard anything thrashed\nbefore. This climaxed the\nmain set and should have left\nthe flailing around for\ndead, but after a short raffle\nthey returned for 'Watching\nWeirdo Sings the Cramps\nInner City Unit, the band\nbased around ex-Hawkwind\nsax blower Nik Turner, played\nthe IC Concert Hall on\nWednesday.

This lack\nof mobility did not affect her\nperformance and they\nstarted well with Dazzle and\nCascade.\nThe light show was\nexcellent and added to the\nelectric atmosphere when\nthey performed some old\nfavourites like Happy House,\nArabian Nights, Melt and\nChristine, and as an encore\nthey did Israel and the new\nsingle Cities In Dust\n(currently whizzing up the\ncharts) which went down as\nwell as the older tracks.\nIt was a very enjoyable\nconcert and they will be well\nworth seeing again when they\nconclude the British Tour at\nthe Royal Albert Hall on\nNovember 28th.

    "content": "Coronary heart disease is\nresponsible for more\ndeaths in the western world\nthan any other disease. Yet,\nin the majority of cases, if\nthe disease had been\ndetected at an early stage\nin its development, then\nsimple changes in lifestyle\ncould have greatly reduced\nthe risk. Here at Imperial\nCollege Dr Don Monro and\nDr Malcolm Clarke, from\nthe Computing Department,\nhave developed a new\nsystem which is able to\nresolve the complex\npatterns of body surface\nelectro car diagrams, and to\ndisplay the response of the\nheart to exercise testing\nwith great accuracy. This\nnew system has the\npotential to detect heart\ndisease while still at an\nearly stage.\nAs the heart beats, an\nelectrical signal is\ngenerated by currents\nsimilar to those that flow in\nany muscle as it contracts.\nThese electrical currents\nflow through the body and\nappear simultaneously all\nover the surface, altering in\nmagnitude and spatial\npattern as the heart beats.\nThe traditional\nthat developments in\ncomputer technology have\novercome these difficulties,\nand opened up the\npossibility of developing a self-contained system,\nwhich is small enough for\nwidespread use.\nDr Monro and Dr Clarke,\nin dev loping the new\nsystem, have taken a fresh\nlook at the way information\ncan be displayed. They\nobtain data on the heart's electrical activity from a large number of electrodes,\nat present forty which are\nlocated across the chest\nand back of the patient.\nThis data is then processed\nto produce a 'map', which\nshows how the magnitude\nof elect ical activity varies\nover the back and chest\narea. With the system it is\npossible to measure this\nbody surface electrical map\nat a rate of 500 per second.\nThe prototype of this\nsystem is already in\noperation at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington;\nwhere it is being used for\nexercise testing of the\nhearts of patients with\nsuspected coronary\ndisease, and for studying\npatients following open\nPattern produced by a normal heart\nThis map indicates a diseased heart\nelectro car diagram measures the signal at a few standard locations, and\ndisplays it as a two\ndimensional plot of\nelectrical activity against\ntime. However, as the\nshape of the\nelectro car diagram varies\ngreatly with location, much\nof the available information\nis not used. There are\nmany problems associated\nwith measuring, processing\nand displaying the great\nwealth of data that can be\nobtained, if you look at the\nheart'sel c tr ical activity as it\nappears all over the body\nsurface. It is only recently\nheart surgery. If a healthy\nperson exercises their heart\nrate gets faster, but the\nshape of the\nelectro car diagram doesn't change. However, if a person suffering from an\nischaemic heart disease\nexercises, an oxygen debt\nbuilds up, and there is a very distinct change in the\nshape of the\nelectro car diagram. The\nmost common form of\nischaemic heart problem is\ncoronary artery disease,\nwhere c holes tro l builds up\nin the arteries, narrowing\nthem and so restricting the\nblood flow. Although the\nThe Heart of\nthe Matter system is capable of\nmeasuring the electrical\nactivity 500 times a second,\nin practice it will do so\nonce every beat of the\nheart, at a point between\ncontraction and recovery\nphase. At this point, when\nexercising, there is a quite\nsignificant difference in the\nappearance of the 'map' for\na healthy person and for a person suffering from\nischaemic heart disease.\nThis is illustrated in fig. 1,\nwhich shows the patterns\nobtained from a healthy\npatient and a patient with\nheart disease. The major\nadvantage of this system is\nthat it can detect these kind\nof heart problems while\nthey are still at an early\nstage, whereas traditional\nelectro car diagram measurements can only\ndiagnose severe cases. At\npresent they are\ninvestigating the possibility\nof using the pattern to\ndiagnose exactly which\nartery is the problem.\nThe system should prove\nto be val u ble for\nsurveillance of post\ncoronary patients during\nrehabilitation. But most\nimportant, it opens up the\npossibility of regular heart\ndisease scanning for the\nwhole population. While\nmost people are aware of\nthe dangers associated with\nsmoking, lack of exercise\nand poor eating habits,\nvery few change their\nlifestyles accordingly.\nDiagnosis of coronary\ndisease, while at an early\nstage, could provide the\njolt' needed to persuade\npeople to do something\nwhile there is still time.\nHowever, heart scanning\non this scale would be very\ncostly, and whether it\nbecomes a reality would\nlargely depend on future\nfinancial constraints.\nAt present, the system is\nstill at the evaluation phase,\nbut it is hoped that in\nfuture it will be widely used\nfor early detection and\naccurate diagnosis of\nvarious forms of heart\ndisease.\nFELIX Friday 8 November\n\n"
