    "content": "2 FELIX\nPROFILE MR. JAMES\nMr. J?.. \u00bb. Jaaea is well lai own both to\nstudents and staff, either in his capacity as\nLibrarian of Guilds or as Hon. Treasurer of\nI.C.U. A.C.C. In the first position, til s helpfulness and\nhis e qua hle disposition, his astounding memory,\ndie Knowledge of chemistry and his amateur\ninterest in wireless and television a ive him\na general Knowledge ij engineering which is invaluable to the students, and combine to make\nhim an extremely popular librarian. His scientific leanings first became\napparent at a small grammar school in Pembrokes hire, where the headmaster, ac racc shot aad an\nenthusiastic disciple of Isaac Walton, was very\ngenerous in the award of half holidays on days\nwhich promised him good sport. Unfortunately,\nanyone acquainted with Pembrokeshire will know\nthe ee occur only too rarely. Having learned all that i Vales could teach\nhim, except how to become a Nationalist and to\nmaster the language of the Land of the Leek, he\nnow came to ri.G.S. During his first year there\nhis patriotism received a serious shock, which\nsuppressed it for ever, when on St. David's Day\nhe arrived sporting a magnificent leek, and was\ninvited by his fellow students to eat it in its entirety or to suffer degradation too horrible to relate. These and other incidents convince\nhim that student life in the late1930' s was much\nmore exciting than it is to-day. However, he\ncams through all these trials, and only retained his accent to bear witness to his Welsh origins. Having graduated, he too ji up research in the\nfield of rubber-cement mixtures, and worked as\nResearch Assistant to Prof.&.( J. H. Clements in the Guilds. He was called up in the army and\nserved his country until1946 when he returned\nto the College as Librarian. His experiences\nin the army, though uneventful, considerably\nenriched his knowledge of human nature, but the\nstories of this period of his life are better left to his own telling. On his return he found the Library in need\nof^ cataloguing and started on the job with\ngreat zest.\" however, when \"t Ll s was half comp-let ed he learned that the Library would be\nmoved to its present position to allow for expansion. He then abandoned cataloguing and\nstarted getting ready for the big move. This took place just before the BU'omer vacation of\n1951; during that time Mr. James could just he\nseen emerging behind piles of books, dust-covered\nbut ever cheerful. He still found time to deal\nwith ordinary enquiries, but at first a hit of luck was needed to find a particular volume from\namong the chaos reigning on the shelves. Old and musty volumes came to light for the fir Bt time\nin many years and have found space on the shelve ts, The Mines Entertainment Conmdttetare urgently seeking\na piece of canvas approximately 10' X60'. Anyone who\nknows its whereabouts is requested to convey it to the\nSecretary, B.I.. Fenhoulet.\nBO'S CONTEMPORARIES. After the Minutes of the meeting of Ist.Feb. 1907 had\nbeen read, the chairman, Col.Mervyn O 'Gorman,' introduced\nthe speaker Mr.T.G. Rose, at the Eng.Soc. and Motor Club\nmeeting ,Feb.26th. The lecture, a repeat of \"The Influence of motor Racing on Car Design\" was originally given\nin1907 by the same speaker, with the same Chairman, and\npartly the same audience.\nBeginning with 1896, when the winner of the Paris to\nBordeaux and back averaged I5m.p.h. for48 hours, solo\nwith only 20 minutes stop, Mr Rose traced automobile\ndesign up to'06. He mentioned the time when a Prefect of\nPolice put two columns of infantry and four heavy guns in t ne path of a race; the time when Janassie on \"Le Jamais\nContent\" did65.3 m.p.h. in'97} the unforgettable occasion when three million spectators covered the route of\nthe \"03 Paris-Bordeaux, and twelve were killed. That put\nthe tin hat on the French long distance races. The winner\naveraged 65m.p.h. So shaken was the Government by the\ntoll of casualties that the cars had to be taken home\nby rail. Mr. Rose showed 48 slides and was never dull she knew\nhis stuff intimately. He described the Darracq cars,\nwhich in'04 reached I04m.p.h. They were rather heavy,\nand after the lecture Col.O 'Gorman described how, as a judge, he once had to weigh a Darracq to make that it was\ninside the IOOCKg. limit. Although the gearbox top had\nbeen replaced by paper, the frame drilled, and everything\nsling able slung,the car was still too heavy. Late that\nnight, Col.O 'Gorman was roused and asked tore weigh the\near. He found that it was within the limit. Mystified, he\nasked the mechanics how they had done it. They said, \"we\nturned the oar upside down and shook it\". This shook Col.O 'Gorman, so he turned the starting handle ,just to make\nsure. There was no resistance. The valve seating s were\ngone. The ear did not qualify.\nSlides of a'05 Guilds ear race were also shown.\nCongratulations to the societies concerned for organising such an interesting and entertaining event.\nMr. James's equanimity was never more\napparent than at this period and largely contributed to the smooth way in which the change-over\ntook place. He has now settled down to re cataloguing, though his natural pessimism makes him\nfear that the expansion of the College will probably mean another change in the future, a prospect he can hardly face. Despite the large amount of work to he done,\nMr. James, whenever he can afford the time, is very willing to talk on a large variety of subjects.\nHe will discuss the construction of wireless sets, amplifiers and television sets with anybody\ninterested, but usually in the last case his advice is don't\".His own personal experience\nended in failure, since, after six months of vicissitudes trying to remedy terrible distortions in his picture, he went out, bought a set, and is now such an enthusiastic viewer that he has lost all interest in T.V.'s technical delights. He enjoys classical music and his opinions\non modern art and music are surprisingly strong\ncoming, from such a mild man. He also likes reading, but not detective stories. He believes in the policy of 'Live and let live'. He is an\ninveterate pipe-smoker. A long time ago he\ndecided to give up smoking hut after a few days\nhis temper became so ex c it a hle that his wife\npresented him with a good supply of tobacco and\nthe advice to put that into his pipe and smoke it. He has never repeated the attempt, and encourages\nstudents in this habit, allowing smoking in the\nLibrary. He is also a great lover of animals, and of cats in particular. As far as his post of Hon. Treasurer\" of\nI.C. Lt.A.C.C. is concerned he can only think of\none reason for his selection. In one memo rahl e staff race he fought gallantly for last place\nrelinquishing it, in true sportsmanlike fashion, to his rival, who received a magnificent hoo hy prize of a goll iwo g.All these are just a few aspects of his character as those who know him well will pro h ably realize. His sympathy and understanding for others, his conscientiousness towards his work\nare very noticeable, hut I think that it is better to finish on the story which he himself considers\nhis most embarrassing moment:\nt\\ former member of the staff asked him if he\nhad seen various scientific articles in an\nencyclopaedia published by a well known daily newspaper. Mr. James, having a very poor\nopinion of this particular paper, said: \"So, hut\nif they are comparable in accuracy to the scientific information published in the paper, they\nare, without doubt, unmitigated rubbish'.\" At\nthat the member of the staff smiled i, paused and\nsaid:\" I wrote that section of the encyclopaedia.\"\nWe apologise for the absence of a photo gra. ph\nof Mr. James.\nThis week's recommended 'eating houses' cater for two\ntypes of lunch hour. The first is prompted by the fee ling that sandwiches and coffee in the Union are, while commanding the required sum, not of sufficient interest. Your\ncorrespondent feels that the Pelham Snack Bar - not to be\nconfused with the Pelham Grill is worth a visit when this is the case. Here a lunch of soup, followed by beans,\nspaghetti or welsh rp,reb it and so on, with a roll and coffee\ncan be had for just over two shillings. The girt behind\nthe counter is very charming, as is the clientele - I ment ion this because I feel that environment is as important\nduring the lunch hour as the food we eat.\nThe second type of lunch you might require is of subs t anti al plain fare. I mean by this such a meal as: soup,\n\"cut off, the joint and 2 ve g.\" rhubarb and custard and\nperhaps coffee; for this I recommend the \"Bath Bun Shop\"\nin Kensington High Street, it is on the left, going west,\nalmost opposite Slater's Restaurant. The \"Bath Bun Shop's\" clientele is small and you can be sure of a table downstairs\nat all times during the lunch hour. The price here is,2/9 or 3/-, and as an added incentive shall I add tha.t they\nsometimes serve a delicious tripe! THIS KEEK'S SPECIAL.\nA longish walk along FuTham Road brings you to no. 208,\nSAIAMIS, Restaurant, where you will find tasteful impress-ionis t water colours, uniformed waiters, serviettes, spot-less ly white cloths, and a very good meal for2/8d. The\ncost may mount a little, as a roll and butter is4 d, and\ncoffee 6d, and there is a small surcharge; but it is an\nexcellent place to take a guest. If we used the star system\nSalami's would get %ne maximum.\nTHE KENSINGTON ORACLE. In a riot, very informative article, the \"Evening\nStandard\" profiled Professor Levy, \" Britain' s Spotl ig ht Scientists.(4). It is reported that he hedged\nquestions about his political affiliations, though he\naffirmed his Marxian beliefs. He made some of his^ usual comments about the popular press, British and Czech\nIt is our opinion that he made more, which were not\nprinted. EATING AROUND I.C. "

    "content": "F ELIX.\nIXL\u00ae RUG GER CUP FINAL. P.L.C UP SE1.1I FI HAL Wye College 3 pte I. e.9pi s.I.C. survived their long journey into darkest Kent and\nare now in the Final for the second successive year, with a good prospect of retaining the Cup. Wye provided much sterner opposition than that encountered in earlier rounds, but\ngenerally speaking IC.controlled the game and never seemed\nlikely to lose. The team was not at full strength because\nof injuries, but Palmer on the left wing and Bell, as hooker,\nwere able substitutes.\nBeginning against as light wind and a slope, I.C. soon\nadvanced to their opponent's'25'. The first score came\nafter ten minutes when Hearn broke through and passed to Palmer who ran strongly to touch down wide on the left. In the midfield play which followed the better drilled I.C. forwards were superior, and our backs, though not always\ntackling very firmly, were able to check the Wye three quarters. and force them into too-frequent kicking. Just before half time I.C. went further ahead when Knox landed a good penalty\nfrom about 40 yards.\nThe second half began with a determined Wye attack, and\nthey sc\"-ed after a high kick into our '25', which was very\npoorly covered by the defence. Further attacks looked\ndangerous, especially when another well-judged kick found\nthe full-back out of position, but at this crucial phase the\nI.C. forwards rose to the occ as sion and gradually worked play\ndown-field. The remaining 20 minutes were a long siege of\nthe Wye goal line with several near-scores. At the very end\nBell fastened on to a strong pass from a defender and crossed\nfor a try. On the evidence of this match I.C.'s cup team is a strong and well-balanced side. The three quarters do not\nlack penetration and the forwards are capable of putting\nheavy pressure on opposing packs. The defence could well be tightened by swifter covering and heavier tackling, but\nthe main thing is to see that an attacking position ones\ngained, is fully exploited by intensive and opportunist\nbacking-up. In the other semi-final Kings defeated Q.H. C. and so will be our opponents at \"lot spur Park on March 14th. Cross Count r yIn perfect conditions I.C. took 5th place in the\nannual Hyde Park Invitation Road Relay (6 x2.75 miles)\nfor the Roderic Hill Cup last Saturday. After being nowhere in the first lap, we recovered to12 th,10 th,8 th6 th and 5th. Although we were improving our position each Hap, we were steadily losing time with respect to the\nwinners, L.S.E. The lap record was lowered to 13m.9s. by Dunkley of L.S.E., and both L.S.E. and Bristol broke the team record.\nRESULTS\n1. L.S.E.2. Bristol3. Manchester 4. U.C.5.I. C.6.

GUILDS\nR.C.S. made sure of a place in the final of the Tech. Cup\nfor the 4th year in succession by defeating Guilds 1-0\non Wed. 18th February. The score suggests a close game\nbut in fact R.C.S. were well on top throughout and only\nbad finishing by their forwards kept the score down. These\ntwo teams are to fight out the Final on the 18th March when\nanother close struggle is expected.\nMINES GUILDS\nA strong Guilds' team easily accounted for a depleted, Mines'\nside on Sat. 28th February. Playing with only nine men for\na considerable time the Mines' team could make no impression\non the Guilds' defence. However, in spite of the odds the\nMiners stuck to their task manfully and all praise is due to\nthose players who turned out for their College knowing that\ntheir chances of succ-ss were small.\nRifle Club If any student in his rush along the tunnel at 9.57 on\na winter's morning R forgot to turn left and mount the stairs at the end of the tunnel, and went through the basement of the post office and under Imperial Institute Road, instead,\nhe would find himself at the wrong end of the college rifle range; the range being another part of the tunnel ( built for the 1851 exhibition) that went from the station to the Albert\nHall.

    "content": "\" TH jS LITi'Lei WORLD 0*' DOj J0AI4 ILL O\"( Italian Version, American Commentary, English Sub-Titles) - La Continentals. The advertisements outside La Continentale\nsay something to the effect that this film is \"The Greatest of ALL Time\". For myself I would\nnot speak of it with quite this degree of enthusiasm, but it certainly ranks among the\ngreatest. I suppose that most people think of it primarily as a comedy even after seeing it, but from my scant knowledge of the country I would consider it to be a sincere caricature of Italian village life just after the late war.\nThe film, being a caricature, the communists\ndo not escape carica tur is ation. Parades, red\nflags, hammer and sickle, and \"Comrades\": all these familiar symbols are stressed, but behind\nit all we are shown the difficulties which they\nare faced with are the good work of improvement\nthat they do; so nicely are all these aspects\nbalanced that the film is neither anti nor pro-Communist in outlook, and could not possibly offend anyone politically. And now what of the two main characters in the film, the Priest, Don Caml ll o, and the Mayor\nReppooe? They both want to do all they can for the improvement of the village, \"but in their own way\" as the commentary says. This is not\nreally so, however. As the story unfolds, we\nfind more and more that they actually do things in the same way. If Reppone has bribed someone to do something it transpires that Don\nCamilla has bribed him not to, and the issue is more often than not settled between the two with\nfists; in fact, we soon find out that Don\nCamillo is the strongest man in the village and\nin communal fights usually knock $ out \"Comrades\"\nto a total of a two-figures number.\nI said earlier that there was nothing\npolitically offensive in the film, but other points}\nhave been under debate on the occasions when Don\nCamillo is in the church he seemingly discourses\nwith Christ, usually speaking to a crucifix; people of a religious turn of mind may feel strongly about this but surely not after the preface of the film which explains that, in reality, it is the voice of Don Camilla's conscience. The\nfunction of this voice is so important, however,\nthat it could hardly be dropped without the\nnecessity of introducing another character, or\nlengthening the action. It is, in effect, the\npoint of influence of a trend in' modern art for economy of line; that is, making one item of your\nmaterial do the work of many.\nThe actual function of the voice is to\nelucidate parts of the story which occur \" off stage\" and to give us some insight in jo the\ncharacter of Don Camillo. Another, less useful, voice, of which the function is uncertain, is the\nAmerican commentary, which slips in at odd times\nof silence to explain points to the audience.\nBesides having an American accent, it under-rates\none's Intelligence and seemed to me unnecessary.\nBut we can hardly blame the producer for that. I advise this film for a really amusing\nevening, but also as one to be remembered\nseriously, less in its narrow characters, than\nin lt B wider implications. H.C. G.

    "content": "FELIX\nLETTERS TCMfHE EDITOR\n.Dear Sir, So vindictive and unjust were your comments on the\nCarnival Cabaret fiasco that they cannot be allowed to\ngo by unchallenged. Your remarks were unjust because\nyou placed all the blame on those who came up from the\nBar without tickets, thus casting suspicion on many\npeople who in fact behaved in exemplary fashion. You\noffered no criticism of the Cabaret itself. The \"Cabaret\" began with a hara seed looking gentleman appealing for one of the actors, who was unaccountably and quite un forgive ably missing. The same gentleman returned shortly afterwards to apologize for the\nlate start. Surely no audience could be expected to\nsit through this in sympathetic silence? Matters were\nmade even worse by the appearance of a frowning John\nHarding, looking like a severe Headmaster, who told us\nthat the Cabaret would not begin until the noise had\nstopped. Next there appeared from between the curtains\na disembodied face, sporting a large moustache, whose\nowner seemed to be either reprimanding us or issuing a further apology. It later transpired that he was the\nunfortunate victim of circumstances and no-one in the\naudience could be blamed for misinterpreting his fun c tion.\nWhen at last the curtains opened fully, to reveal\nJohn Harding with Joe Lockyer at the piano, the audience\nfell silent and gave an appreciative hearing to some\ngood and excellently delivered songs.\nUnfortunately the sketch which followed depended\nalmost entirely on the ears rather than the eyes of the\naudience. It consisted largely of two characters chatting amiably to themselves and was quite unsuitable for\nthe occasion. It contained too many dispirited scenes -on several occasions when the curtains were closed our\nhopes of a merciful de live rence were almost immediately\nshattered by the curtains parting again to reveal the\nsame rather static scene.\nIt is absolute nonsense for you to write of \"louts\ninflicting their coarse and sottish habits on a crowd of\nrevellers waiting to hear the carefully prepared entertainment of more tasteful artists on the stage.\" Most\nof the audience wanted to see people - preferably people\nthey knew well - performing some act which was funny to\nwatch - slapstick of some kind, perhaps. This should\nhave been anticipated by the B.C.S. Entertainments Committee .\nYour idea of chuck ers out is in any case ludicrous,\nas the \"brutes\" to whom you referred were not so \"spontaneously senile\" that they could have been chucked out\neasily. In fact it would probably have been a case of\nthe chuck ers chucked.\nThis is by no means the first time that a Cabaret\nhas been given a noisy reception, and the emphasis in your remarks is out of all proportion to the importance\nof the incident.\nlou wrote that the \"louts\" seemed unaware of the\nhard work which goes into the production of a Carnival,\nSo does Felix, judging by the unkind comments published\nabout the decorations, which I thought were worthy of\nhigh praise. Congratulations to the tasteful artists \u2022\nwho prepared them.\nFinally, I hope that the brutes and louts who burned!\n\"Amanda\" on the Tennis Courts have apologized to the\nTennis Club for their irresponsible action, which might\nwell have damaged the court surface more than it actually\ndid Yours faithfully, Ed. replies T. Total\nIf I may respectfully submit a correction co your\nchronology, the disembodied face which tried to give a monologue appeared some time before John Harding. I was seated near the front, and it was possible for me\nto hear the monologue unsuccessfully begun several times.\nYou were at the back among the noisy people, and it was\ndue entirely to their efforts that you were unaware that\nthe entertainment had started. It was the behavior of\nyour colleagues at this time which was particularly\nobjectionable; for once the cabaret was under way the\nbar racking was little worse than normal.\nMy idea of chuck ers out is, I agree, ludicrous.\nMany of your associates would have been very difficult to remove. Thank you for reminding me.\nMy criticism of the decorations was, as I explained,\nan essay in objectivism. I too considered the technical execution worthy of high praise, but I felt that,\nviewed as an ensemble there was something missing. My\nremarks were on the general friendly level which I welcome in criticism of FELIX.\n1 join with you in deploring the tennis court dams ge. You accuse me of being \"vindictive\". Yet, before I wrote the Editorial comments on the Carnival I had al ready written praising those who went to Canvey more than\nonce. Some of these people thus found themselves attacked in one paragraph and congratulated in the next. It\nis the concern of FELIX to present fair comment.\nThere has been a tendency for a certain amount of\nrowdiness at our other dances. It is my opinion that,\nwhen we invite ladies to our Union, we should behave\nproperly. I do not withdraw any of my comments, though\nI am aware that they have done me harm in some quarters.\nFinally, if you care to come out from behind your\nnom de plume, and your friends with you, (those who feel\nthey have been unjustly maligned) I am prepared to print\nyour names under a letter dissociating yourselves from\nthe actions which made so many sober people shudder on\nCarnival Night.\nDear Sir,\nPeter Rowe's letter in the last i a sue of FELIX\nneeds a rejoinder, for i to on tain s a special plea for the\nindependence of I.C. as a degree conferring body.My intimate experience is only in one faculty (mathematics) of the\nB. Sc.(Eng), but from conversations with colleagues in othe\nother departments I have reason to believe that it i a not\nexceptional.\nAa an examiner for the External degree I would a a sure Mr Rowe that the maths syllabus is not so inflexible as\nhe thinks, nor are the teachers of the subject so handicapped in the institutions which take this degree. Tha\n\"External\" has a number of defects , as these teachers\n(and I) are aware, but weakness in teaching and in examination is not among them.Naturally thoa eun iver a it y institutions which are still growing up would much prefer to have their own degrees, instead of being subject\nto the London External degree. But the \"rub\" comes mostly in the field of autonomy.\nMr Rowe wishes the external degree to be equivalent to\nits internal counterpart'. Speaking for the B. Sc. (Eng)\nthere is the 'General Internal' degree and the 'Special\nInternals\" at four Colleges. Moderators appointed by\nLondon University in the various faculties do their best\nto ensure that there is equivalence in the 6 examinations\nwithout any hampering rigidity. Their cons cie nti ou a efforts prove reasonably successful: Moreover, a 'Co-ordinating Board' in mathematics, (consisting of examiners in the 6 examinations together with the moderator)\nmeet B annually to examine problems of examination pro-ce dure. In fact, the dire results Mr. Rowe decries do\nnot exist. Admittedly there is room for improvement but\nthis will be achieved through informal methods which have\ncharacterised London University for so long.\nThe latter part of Mr. Rowejs letter is more pertinent\n\"Imperial College is large enough and sufficiently well\nestablished to stand alone\". This has the familiar ring\nof nearly 30 years ago which saw an earlier drive for a technological university of South Kensington awarding it a own degrees\". Whether this would \"attract more academic\nindividualist a\" and whether such an influx la desirable are\nmatter a of opinion. The teaching staff under tha \"responsible Professor\" have considerable latitude in teaching\neven now and the mode rational system above referred^ to go ea a long way to ensuring that standards are safeguarded.\nIt is when this plea for independence is linked with\nexpansion of the College that there are signs of danger.\nThe great gain in tha Government pronouncement of last\nJanuary was the announcement of the dec iai on to expand sons\nexisting technological department a of Universities instead\nof building a new technological univer8ity or tha institution of a purely degree (or diploma) conferring body.\nImperial College i a not the only college due for expansion;\nnor is it the only college of London University doing tha\nB. Sc. (Eng.) degree.\nThe work of expanding the College will be a test of state\nj man ship for many years to come, taxing resources of patience,\n'j goodwill and negotiation - from the Governing Body to those\nthought of as lowest in I.C. hierarchy. In my opinion it would be folly to rupture the good relations between the\nSenate House and Imperial College ao splendidly built up in\nrecent years by pressing for independence. London Univers it y through its Court and in other ways, endeavours to deal\nJfairly with its constituent Colleges and our College is xor tuna te in benefiting from the personal touch. The\nstrife engendered by such a move for independence would not\nbe worth the candle. The work of the 3 colleges forming\nI.C/ is well-known, the qualifications they confer are\n[honoured 'labels' end there would be no gain, either to students or to the College, in a 'new f angled' degree. London\nUniversity has a long and fine tradition and its degrees have\na hall mark' the world over.\nAs one who has been a member of the teaching staff for\n(over 30 years and remembers the days before 1926 when the\nCollege had, perhaps, a better claim to press for a separate\nUniversity status I would urge Mr. Rowe to think again.\nYours sincerely,\nA. J. Hatley\nDaar Sir,\nOur President, Fred Spriggs has bean invited to\nrepresent London on a delegation which the Student Labour\nFederation is sending^to the U.S.S.R. for a fortnight in\nthe Easter vacation.

    "content": "EVERY\nFORTNIGHT\nNo. 47. 6 th MARCH1953. OL LEG EA surprise Rag meeting was called in the Union last\nFriday lunch-hour. The crowded Gym was told of I.C.'s plat\nto kidnap the three French students who were coming over for\nthe Reading University Rag. These ladies had been invited\nby the men students of Reading to lead their Rag Procession.\nReading women students objected, of course, to this slight\non their physical charms. They appealed to the men of\nLondon Colleges (and in person to the P.M.) to uphold the\nname of British womanhood and protest at the arrival of\nthese French \"lovelies\". I.C. were certainly glad of an\nexcuse for a rag, but they had their own ideas about what\nshould happen to the visitors. The plan was to \"coax\" them\nto come to the Residents Dinner and Ball on Friday night,\nand then dispatch them to Reading on Saturday morning.\nFELIX arrived early at Victoria and witnessed the\ndramatic entrance of I.C. They were heralded by a subterranean rumbling, then with a crescendo of I.C'.,I. C!( still no war cry!) they burst from the Tube stairways and in\nseconds had enveloped the station. The leading banner\n(\"Le diable a vo tre der rie re Jacques, I.C. est content\")\nwas hoisted to a place of prominence and I.C. were momentarily hushed as they learnt, from the newspapers, that the\ngirls were not coming. Then the men of I.C. looked at each\nother with a mild surmise: \"'tis a Fleet-Street-Reading Conspiracy\" and spirits soured again. Singing and chanting\nstirred Victoria's rusty frame; banners were set alight\nonly to be trodden down by the police; police reinforcements poured in. The train arrived; no French girl a. I.C. dashed to cover all exits and would allow no one to\nleave the platform. Two young things were reported to be\nhiding in the Customs shed and the Police or British Railways Staff were suspected of ill intent. Throughout this\nwhole \"business every one kept in good humour. The public\nthought it a great joke; the porters loved every minute of\nit and the police although pelted with flour bags (not thrown\nby I.C., FELIX is pleased to note) wore broad grins. One\nirate te jd man who was losing considerable custom, was heard\nto remark, however, \"B lot of hooligans, causing all these\nb gates to be b well closed.\nMembers of the Staff prominent in the crowd during thi a waiting period were a well-known duff le coated member of the\nPhysics Dept. and an equally well-known member of the Maths.\nDept. \"Hector1\nwas also, prominent. \"Hector\" was a fierce-looking tiger's head, supported on a pole, which was snarling\nviciously at every blue-coated gentleman in sight. This\nhead was found unaccountably over the entrance to Bines on\nFriday morning.\nSoon I.C. had to admit that the trio were not on the\ntrain and the Police were able to clear a passage for the\npassengers to get off the platform.\nThe College returned to the Union in two forces. One\nwalked back, taking a railway trolley and the usual booty,\nand lost one member to the Police. The other group travelled by tube and were grieved to find that Kensington didn't. want them, or so it seemed, for S. Ken. Station was heavily\nbarricaded. The defences were overcome, for only one militant port res s wielding a broom offered any resistance.\nUNION PLANS. Contemplated additions to the Union came in for a good\nleal of discussion at the Refectory Committee Meeting on\n23rd February. The Student Presidents expressed the\nopinion that current proposals for two extra floors above\nthe Union are inadequate; and that all should be done to\nhave a site elsewhere.\nA working party i3 to investigate the possibility of\nSilwood Park supplying us with fruit, vegetables, poultry\nand pigs.\nThe Refectory looks like having a deficit the same size\nas last year's, for while prices have risen, ZCff, less meals\nare sold. Food supply costs have also risen. Nevertheless, the current meal prices are to be retained. Apprecia'\ntion was expressed of the fine work done by the chef in\npreparing meals for people returning in the late evening\nfrom Canvey.\nThe suggestions book in Queenies' is not being used to\nthe best advantage. Neither is the buffet service on Saturday dance nights (the fate of this hangs in the balance).\nThe Refectory will close from April 1st to 9thin clu sive.\nOffering from Victoria to Albert\nSo I.C. gathered near the Union and feeling in need of\nspiritual comfort after their disappointment at Victoria,\npleaded movingly for \"Music!* outside R.C.M. This came in the form of a wavering piccolo and a doleful horn. Thus\nre vitali sed the crowd turned to their old friend Prince Albert\nIndeed it was fitting that they should tell the Prince all that had been happening to Victoria. At a second attempt a police helmet was firmly fixed on the Consort's head, and\nr or nearly half an hour I.C. reigned on the Memorial steps\nwith no Officer of the Law in sight. Then three arrived,\non bicycles, through the pa*- to clear the barriers which\nhad been put up across the Zebra, to ensure a safe crossing\nfor the few hundred members of I.C. who wished to pay homage to Albert. More police arrived and an unfortunate scuffle over the barriers resulted in another member of I.C. leaving in a Black Maria.\nMeanwhile, tired and disappointed, President MacFie\nand Co. arrived back from Dover. They had travelled over-night, and had scrutinised in vain the unloading of two\nboats from the Continent.\nAn interesting anecdote is recorded, about the crowd\nwhich surged past a helpless ticket collector at Victoria.\nHe managed to stop the last two people of the mob, and a eked for their tickets, smacking his lips in anticipation of\nprosecution. They produced season tickets! The collector\nwas at least as surprised as the student who later found\nhimself travelling along Prince Consort Road at 30 m.p.h. on a car front bumper; and possibly more surprised than the\nUnion clocks, which stopped in protest when a porters'trailer\nwas carried in, and have been funny ever since.\nIn recognition of the excellent conduct of the police\non this, our first Coronation Year clash, FELIX suggests that\nthe Rag Committee make a collection for the Police Benevolent\ni Fund ffe print the correspondence which led to the affair at\n.Victoria.\nPresident, Reading (Women?) to President, I.C.

    "content": "FELIX\nFelix\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE i it or iA.R. Bray Circulation:1200. A recent correspondent in the Letters column\nadvocated a return to the use of student academic\ngowns, his idea being the construction of an\natmosphere of learning; of belonging; of a University. He was joking, but there is a fundamental truth behind the joke.\nOur Post Graduates are notorious for their lack of\ninterest in Union affairs. Kost of them know the\n\"well-bred club\" atmosphere which exists at some older\nuniversities. There are places which have professors no\nbetter than ours, laboratories s nd theatres no less antiquated, and yet which turn out men much more suited to taking top places in industry. The answer? Atmosphere.\nIf the present scheme for adding two floors to the Union is carried out, we shall be sitting pretty. There will be plenty of room for all activities; room for calm reflection, and room\nfor companionship. Long ago, it was realised that our Union, built for600, was far too small\nfor the present 1600; and it was decided that it should be increased. And it appears that those\nlong planned increases are to occur now. How\nlucky we are'.\nBut when we remember that we are to double\nour student population, things look a little different. The scheme which will add two floors above the gym, cannot include much extra hostel accommodation, and while it might have satisfied1500, it will be hopeless for3000. Let us look ahead. It is well known that\nthose who live in the Hostel have social advantages denied to the rest of us. If our present\nHostel residents were all to disappear overnight, social and athletic life in the Union would die; for those people are the cream of1.0. Many of them are much the same as the rest of us, but they\nhave developed and matured in the stimulating cond it ions of a life which involves constant close\ncontact with other intelligent and tasteful people,\nThe solution: the only solution which can be\nseriously considered in the light of the Government's heart-cry for enlightened leaders of Technology, is that there should be a large hostel in a single unit, with a single compact Union closely interwoven into it. Every student should be able\nto spend at least one, and preferably two years\nin that place: that place which may come to be a real University. Now is the time for action. If we add our\ntwo paltry floors, spending a large sum on a scheme which is from the start obviously inadequate, then we severely .jeo pardi se our chance of being able to build a new Union later. The Technological University is not an idle opium dream. It has a greater chance now of coming into being than it ever had before. But, at the heart, it does not lie solely in spotless and up-to-date laboratories. It can only be\nfounded on a nucleus, a colossal nucleus, of intelligent, broad minded University men; men\nwhose science degrees are not the objects of scorn from veneered Oxford men. It cannot rest on tin trays, and a gabbling refectory, and overcrowded lounges, and long tube rides, and isolation from fellow students, and all the other things which combine to make the average I.C. product\na narrow (though efficient, within limits) technical sausage.\nThis being the most important matter ever\ntackled, or ever likely to be tackled by FELIX,\nyour views are, top* t it mildly, welcome.\nA MASCOT AT LAST. U.L. DEBATE\nIs hall never understand why the frivolous always has '\na greater attraction for the undergraduate than the morally\nor politically important; especially when the latter directly concerns his career.\nOn February 20th the motion - \" It is better to have\nloved and lost much better!\" was carried by 25 votes to22 with 8 abs tensions, while the following week a flow of\nonly 20 debated \"This house believes military service is not\na service to the community.\" That it was carried by 10\nvotes to2 must have been as much due to the sincerity and\nexperience the secretary of the non-conscript committee\nbrought to its defence, as to the lack of logic in Commander\nRansorae's opposition. It was also unfortunate for his cause,\nand discourteous to the house, for him to leave during the\ncourse of the debate, whatever the excuse-Roger Fisher\n\u2022The interior of the Benato House looks like Hollywood's version of Cleopatra':; Bath\" \u2014 Prof. Read.\n\"Herbert\", our new mascot shook its gay plumage and\nblinked its wicked eye for the first time at the I.C. Union\nMeeting on the 24th February.\n\"Herbert\", a Phoenix, named after H.G. Wells the\nfounder of FELIX'S contemporary is at present 2' 6\" of\nvividly painted plaster. But a metamorphosis is believed\nto be imminent. \"Herbert\" will then emerge in his final form of concrete or i lu mini um; which it will be only the\nGods can tell( and the I.C. Rag Committee who anyway, since\nthe Union Meeting, must have moved their digs to lit. Olympus).\nAll those who have hot already seen \"Herbert\" are urged\nto support I.C. at the U.L. Rugger Cup Final on March 14th,i here it is rumoured He will be giving a ceremonial \" fly; ast\", and (we hope) a Victory loop.\nThe other important news at the Union Meeting concerned I.C.'s plans for the Coronation. The President, after telling us that I.C.'s allocation of tickets for the U.L. Coronation Ball was only thirty five, suggested that I.C. should run their own Ball on Coronation Day. This suggestion was loudly approved. The provisional plans for this Ball include dancing in all four rooms, a buffet in the\nSnack Bar, and a Beer Garden in the tennis courts.\nSports Day, on June 4th,is to be a general College\nholiday s nd it is hoped that it will be a \"Gs.la\" affair, with Clubs and Societies running side-shows and everybody\nencouraged to \"make a day of it\". The Gliding Club hope to give a display. There was considerable discussion at the\nmeeting, on where the Sports Day Hop should be held.\nHarlington, the Union and something \" floating\" between the\ntwo, such as a boat on the River, were all suggested, but\nfinally, as usual, the decision and arrangements were left with the Entertainments Committee. Another proposal which,\nin the words of the Minutes \"was greeted with acclamation\",\nwas that the Harlington transport on Sports Day, should be\nused on the return journey for a Grand Tour of London.\nPhillip Allsopp, who is a member of the Ayrton Hall Committee, announced that the serving rate there should\nImprove shortly.\nThe President asked for the Union's opinion on a strong recommendation which is to be sent by the President's council of U.L., to the University Grants Committee, asking\nthat college refectories are subsidized for meals served in the vacations. The Union gave their full support to the\nPresident to vote for this recommendation.\nWe are asked to insert the following.;\nOFFICIAL APPOINTMENTS\nThe Australasian Government announces a limited number\nof vacancies for PHYSICISTS to be employed as ROCKET\nTECHNOLOGISTS. The work will be, in the main, concerned\nwith rocket detecting and path plotting. The success-ful candidate will, for the first10 years of the 1 5\nyears' appointment, perform annual tours of1134 months in the Western Australian Desert. He will live in a tent, spending the hours of daylight seated in a specially cons tru c ted chair, facing the Rocket Base. His duties will involve starting a stop-watch on sighting a rocket, following the path of the missile until such time as the back of his head strikes the ground, then stopping the stop-watch. The salary will be \u00a3a4 oO( less10% cost of living deduction). In the event of a man losing eight of a rocket the cost of that rocket( approximately \u00a3A250,000) will be deducted from his salary.
