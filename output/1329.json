    "content": "LIVE REVIEWS\n\u201cAre there drums?\u201d he asks hope-fully. I shake my head ruefully\nremembering our last musical outing to see The Engineers (he fell\nasleep, dressed in his tux from the\nnight before). Perhaps in retrospect,\nMirah\u2019s acoustic \u201clo-fi indie pop\u201d\ngig, might not be the place to take\none\u2019s Rock and Roll Drummer.\nIt seems these days that the growing nomenclature of the music world\nseems to make things harder and\nharder to classify. \u201cLo-fi indie pop?\u201d\nMirah, Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn.\nKingdom: Indie, Phylum: folk,\nSpecies: Acoustic female. Coming\nfrom an \u201cartistic\u201d (hippy) Jewish\nPhiladelphia background, Mirah\nstarted with a jazz band and then\nwent solo. Having working with The\nMicrophones, she released her first\nalbum in 2000, followed by another\nfour solo album/collaborations with\nC\u2019mon Miracle being the latest that\nshe is here to promote. Busy girl.\nShe arrives onstage, regrettably\ndrummerless but accompanied by\nan accordion player with a beard on\nthe run from ZZTop and plunges into\nJerusalem, a sweet, if slightly naive\ntrack from the new album. With\ntwo guitars backing up the accor-dion, she\u2019s high-pitched, sweet and\nbreathless; \u201cI let you have it,\u201d she\nlaments during Cold Cold Water.\nWith the pure guitar songmanship of\nSuzanne Vega, Mirah\u2019s voice is more\nyouthful, without the sultry purr,\nmore sensitive than sexual. A few\nmore lyrically based songs and she\nfinishes with Dogs Of Buenos Aires,\nanother one off C\u2019mon Miracle, an\nupbeat ballad of heart break \u201cunder\nthis Argentina sky.\u201d\nSimple and pleasant, Mirah\u2019s live\nperformance was a stark contrast to\nthe two bands (Hands On Heads &\nLes Georges Leningrad) that came\non afterwards. Thankfully we\u2019d had\na few bottles of wine by then and\nmost of what I wrote about them is\nillegible, the general theme seeming\nto be art school bollocks of fashion\nand noise over talent, beautifully\nexposed by Mirah\u2019s honest poignant\ncraft.\nHarriet Tennant\nBearing in mind that mere hours\nbefore setting off to see The\nOffspring \u2013 the band to whom I lost\nmy CD-buying virginity back in 1994\n\u2013 I had both managed to permanently delete my entire dissertation from\nthe heap of junk I call a computer\nand also witnessed a nasty incident\ninvolving a man, a wallet, and a\nthief on my bus, I was needless to\nsay less than in the party mood.\nBut immediately upon entering the\nAcademy, greeted by chanting and\ngeneral teenage overexcitement, I\nfound myself getting that \u201cnervous\nyet thrilled yet pretty sure this is\ngonna hurt\u201d feeling I haven\u2019t had in\na long while; disappointment was\nnot on the cards.\nIn a re-working of the classic\nopening to the album Smash, that\nslow American drawl came over the\nspeakers this time not telling us to\nrelax but to \u201cTear s**t up,\u201d and what\ncould provide the perfect soundtrack for such an activity? Why, Bad\nHabit of course. But it was only after\nthe near perfect succession of epics\nAll I Want, Come Out And Play and\nGone Away, each getting an approving roar upon their distinctive open-ings, that I remembered that this\nis a band touring for a greatest hits\nalbum. Tonight there was no self-indulgence, no songs you had to\nstruggle to remember, no messing\naround; just an hour and a half of fin-ger-pointing-manic-jumping-voice-wrecking-exhausting-massive fun.\nIn addition to this The Offspring\nis a band that knows how to make a\nfan feel special. Dexter and Noodles\u2019\npromise that we are the best crowd\nthey\u2019ve ever had is almost believable and we\u2019re rewarded with golden\noldies like Smash and a sprinkling\nof the less offensive newer offerings in the shape of Americana and\nStaring At The Sun. By the time the\npredictable encore of Self Esteem\nrolls round it is not only the icing but\nthe hundreds and thousands, cherries and whipped cream on the cake\nof a wholeheartedly energetic, dare\nI say it, polished-been-in-this-business-for-years-so-we\u2019ve-crackedthe-formula performance.\nNo trendy a**holes here, just for\nme (please excuse the gushing), the\nmost fantastic gig of this decade.\nHarriet Tennant\nWhat can you do in 15 minutes?\nWatch half an episode of Friends?\nListen to a third of your favourite album? Read this week\u2019s edition of Felix? Well if you\u2019re the Foo\nFighters you can sell out a gig at\nthe Astoria, virtually melting down\nthe ticket booking system in the\nprocess. It\u2019s rare for a band as big\nas the Foos to play a venue as small\nas the Astoria, especially when they\ncan sell out arenas like Earls Court\n(where they\u2019ll be playing two nights\nthis December) without breaking\nsweat. Then again, this is no ordinary gig. Not part of a scheduled\ntour, it\u2019s been billed as a \u201csecret\u201d\nwarm-up gig for their appearances\nat the Carling Weekend, which is\nwhy the two thousand fans crammed\ninto the venue anticipate something\ntruly special.\nAfter a distinctly unimpressive\nsupport set from Death From Above\n1979, Dave Grohl & Co. stride on\nto a rapturous welcome. Then the\nofficial \u201cnicest guy in rock\u201d tells the\nexcitable crowd that they will play\nsome of the songs that they don\u2019t\nnormally play before the band rip\nthrough album track Hell off their\nlatest album, In Your Honour. It\u2019s a\nperformance of real power and passion and really shows that the band\naren\u2019t going to treat this as simply a\n\u201cwarm-up\u201d gig.\nThe next 105 minutes is a lesson\nin how rock gigs should be done.\nWhile the band are a tight and finely\ntuned unit clearly at the top of their\ngame musically, Grohl gives a master class in how to work an audi-ence. He constantly professes his\nlove for Reading Festival claiming\nit to be the best in the world. A few\nsongs into the set, after the epic My\nHero, Grohl jokes to the audience\nthat during the last song he sang so\nhard he threw up in his mouth and\nurges the sweaty audience to do the\nsame for the next song. They may\nbe well worn crowd pleasing tactics\nbut Grohl has the ability to make\nyou believe him anyway with his disarming charm. Highlights from the\nset which took songs from all five of\nthe bands albums included a short\nrendition of recent Oasis single Lyla\nwhich the Foos covered earlier in the\nweek for BBC Radio 1 and a brilliant\nsolo version of Everlong, but arguably the best was saved for last. The\nthree song encore featured album\ntrack Cold Day In the Sun which\nfeatures drummer Taylor Hawkins\non vocals. The song saw him move\nto the front of the stage and pick\nup a guitar with Grohl taking up\nresidence behind the drums. It was\na moment which made you remember how awe inspiring Grohl is with\ndrum sticks in his hands instead of\na guitar. More surprisingly though,\nit made you realise that Hawkins\nhas been learning a few tricks from\nGrohl and actually does convince as\na guitar playing front man despite a\nrather awkward stance.\nAfter closer All My Life the Foos\nleave the stage with Grohl grinning\nfrom ear to ear, and why shouldn\u2019t\nhe? Clearly not all nice guys finish\nlast.\nDom Wong\nC\u2019mon, Mirah!\nLo-\ufb01 female with a back catalogue that involves work with Phil Elvrum\u2019s The Microphones\nbrings her show to the intimate surroundings of the Buzzard\nFoo Fighters - people only want to see ol\u2019 Dave, anyway.\nmusic music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nMirah - exceptionally talented as well as beautiful.\nMirah\nThe Buzzard\nHHHHI\nFoo Fighters\nAstoria\nHHHHH\nThe O\ufb00spring\nBrixton Academy\nHHHHH\n10\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 6 October 2005\n\n"

It is the beginning\nof the University year, and for many\nstudents starting at Imperial, the\nstart of a whole range of new expe-riences; including organising their\nfinances and paying their own bills.\nHowever, TV Licensing is offering\nstudents some good(ish) news: if\nthey buy their TV licence before the\nend of October, they may be egilible\nfor a refund of over \u00a330 at the end\nof the year. Students could use the\ncash to buy a budget airline roundtrip ticket for that end of studies\nbreak.\nAll students who use or install television equipment, such as PCs with\nbroadcast cards, set-top boxes, DVD\nor video-recorders, to receive or\nrecord television programme serv-ices, are legally required to have a\nTV licence.\nNicky Barrett, Student Campaign\nManager for TV Licensing said:\n\u201cBeing caught without a TV licence\nis no joke, which is why we\u2019re urging\nImperial students to get a licence\nnow\u201d. She told Felix that \u201cEnquiry\nOfficers and detector vans are going\nto be checking up on student university accommodation throughout the\nUK, so students should seriously\nthink about getting a TV licence now\nso they can avoid a fine.\u201d\nLast year, TV Licensing caught\nan average of over 1,000 licence fee\nevaders each day. If caught, students could risk a trip to court and a\nfine of up to \u00a31,000, plus court costs.\nThey will also still have to get a\nlicence if they need one. A colour TV\nlicence currently costs \u00a3126.50.\nStudents can easily purchase their\nlicence online at www.tvlicensing.\nco.uk/students and choose from a\nnumber of ways to pay, including\nDirect Debit. Currently, over 12 million customers pay for their colour\nTV licence by Direct Debit.\nIf you purchase your TV licence in\nOctober 2005, and you don\u2019t need it\nfor July, August and September 2006,\nyou could be eligible for a refund of\n\u00a331.62. Veronica King, NUS VicePresident Welfare said: \u201cStudents\nhave never been poorer and every little helps.

Scientists\nthis week warn that viruses frozen\nin ice for thousands of years may\nthaw and be released into a community unequipped to combat them.\nFew, apart from American politicans deny the potential environment\nproblems posed by global warming.\nThe research, including the increasing snowless season are indusput-able.\nNow this new fear, of release of\nage-old viruses against which we\nwill have no natural defences, adds\nincreased emphasis to the global\nwarming issue.\nScientists believe that during the\nfreezing process, organisms such\nas fungi, bacteria and viruses may\nhave been incorporated into the ice\nsheets. As ancient glaciers and ice\nsheets melt, illnesses and viruses\ncould potentially be unleashed. Not\nonly humans, but other animals,\nplants and marine creatures are\nsusceptible to the release of such\norganisms.\nGeoffrey Smith, head of the virology department at Imperial College\nLondon routinely \u201ckeeps viruses at\nminus 80\u00b0C, when we want to store\nthem... so viruses can certainly survive freezing\u201d. However, he explains\nthat not all viruses are functional on\nfreezing, as they are \u201coften fragile to\nprocesses such as freeze-thaw\u201d.\nThe Careers Advisory Service has\nintroduced two new initiatives for\nthe coming year.\nJobLive is a new web based\nsearchable database of vacancies\naimed specifically at Imperial students and graduates. Registering\nwith the system allows you to input\na profile of the type of vacancy you\nare interested in, industry sector,\ntype of job and geographical area.\nYou will then receive email alerts\nevery time a new vacancy is added to\nthe database.

    "content": "sport sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nQuick Crossword by Turnip Henry\nBrown on sport\nStephen Brown\nSports Editor\nAs the Premiership season\nprogresses the cries in the national\nmedia seem to have deviated from\nclaims made in previous years about\nit being the best league in the world\nto performing some sort of long\ndrawn out funeral sermon. Most of\nthese premature obituaries cover\na variety of the games alleged ills\nfrom falling attendance levels to the\ndominance of Chelsea via the view\nthat the game is now just plain bor-ing. Some commentators were even\nprepared to back up their claims\nwith their own cash. In the sports\nspeculators bible The Racing Post\ntipster Tony Cascarino advised readers to bet Liverpool and Chelsea\nto play out another scoreless draw.\nHopefully the resulting 4-1 scoreline\ndidn\u2019t hurt too many pockets. Here\nnow is a brief outline of some of the\nrecent whinges about the beautiful\ngame and why they should not be\nlistened to.\nA common complaint this season\nis that matchday attendance figures\nhave suffered due to a combination\nof excessive TV coverage and high\nticket prices. Increased prices are\njust an inevitable consequence of\nthe games immense popularity so\ntough cheese. It could be argued\nthat high prices actually allow more\nfans to see their team at some point\nin the season as it reduces demand\nfor \u201cregular\u201d tickets. Sympathy\nmust be felt for the fans who have\nto travel long distances in time for\na midday Saturday kick-off but at\nthe same time we must accept that\nthe days of the entire fixture card\nkicking off at 3pm are consigned to\nhistory and that the game is better\noff because of it. Schedules have\n20\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 6 October 2005\nbeen changed so that Sky may show\nfour or five games in one weekend.\n\u201cWhy should Rupert Murdoch get\nto specify when my beloved team\nplays?\u201d I hear you cry. Well this is\nwhy. You want to watch megastars\non mega-salaries? Then the game\nhas to have the ability to generate\nthe funds to assemble your dream\nteam. Apart from the occasional oligarch the vast majority of clubs rely\non their supporters for cash flow.\nIncreased media coverage makes\nclubs far more marketable and\nhence more profitable. Any loss on\nmatchday ticket sales to television\nwill be dwarfed by the sums of additional revenue teams have enjoyed\nover the past ten years from the satellite companies and also by indirect\nincome via the extra fans drawn to\nthe game by all this new publicity.\nIn particular this rings true with\nregards to the overseas markets.\nSomelamentthefactthatthegame\nis now in thrall to big money. When\npeople mention big money the team\nthat springs to mind is Abramovich\u2019s\nChelsea. To an extent money does\nbuy success in terms of the personnel you can afford but no amount of\ncash can buy team spirit or tactical\ngenius both of which Chelsea have\nby the bucketload. It was only a few\nyears ago that Man Utd supposedly had an unassailable postion at\nthe top of the game. Not even the\nmost diehard red would make that\nclaim now. Best of luck to Chelsea I\nhope they enjoy their purple patch\nbut it is by no means a permanent\narrangement. The finances of football are merely an example of the\nfree market system that is responsible for our great society in its purest\nform. Astronomical salaries for the\noutrageously talented ensure that\nonly the best make it onto the pitch\nPlease send your sports\nreviews and reports to\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nand onto our television screens.\nWage caps? No chance! Socialism\nis a doctrine that has been tested to\ndestruction across the world. We\u2019d\nhave to be fairly stupid to allow it to\npoison our Premiership\nSo self-righteous whingers please\nleave our game alone. We know you\nare probably part of the brigade who\ndeclared cricket the \u201cnew\u201d football\nfollowing England\u2019s magnificent triumph over Australia. Whilst it is\nalways good to see (dare I say it)\nthe less well followed sports have\ntheir day at the same time it is\ndelusional to think that any sport\nwill overtake football as our chief\nsporta franca in terms of revenue\nand viewing figures. Who has the\ngall to present fans with these false\ndichotomies? I mean following football and cricket, rugby or whatever\nelse you are interested in are not\nmutually exclusive pursuits. Lastly\nto those of you who now believe\nthe game is now just boring due to\nthe tactical conservatism of some\nmanagers. This is a perfectly valid\nopinion but before expressing it so\nvehemently I urge you to consider\nfollowing Mr Cascarino\u2019s example\nand putting your money where your\nmouth is. It would be churlish to\ncriticise the game otherwise.\nFor those of you who really want\nto affirm your loyalty to the game\nwhat could be a better tribute than\nplaying yourself?

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nHello students, and welcome to a\nnew year at Imperial College! Did\nyou have a good holiday? You look\ngreat with that tan! Ok, so today\nwe\u2019re going to start you off on a new\nactivity to practice for the new year.\nI call this one \u201cHow to form your\nown trendy rock band.\u201d It\u2019s sim-ple! Everyone\u2019s doing it these days,\nsuch as recent London beat combo\nThe Rakes, with their debut album\nCapture/Release.\nFirst off, get your band together\nand write a handful of good, catchy\nnumbers so as to attract enthusi-asm. Make sure they are genuinely\ninteresting, filling them with unusual turns of tune to make attractive\nto the ear and brain, such as the\nbreakdown in Retreat or the sudden monologue in Work, Work, Work\n(Pub, Club, Sleep). Write the lyrics\nfull of observations on modern life,\nsuch as the work/life balance in the\naformentioned Retreat, or the cold\nwar divide in the opener Strasbourg,\nso you make sure the songs actually\nmean something.\nGot enough attention now? Good,\ntime to write the full album. But\nhang on there; writing enough\nsongs, especially to a good stand-ard, just takes too long these days\ndoesn\u2019t it? No no no, what you need\nto do is rush out an unchallenging,\nderivative album, which is quick and\neasy to produce. Besides, with all\nthe hype you\u2019ve produced, who\u2019s to\nknow or care?\nIf you\u2019re stuck for material, fill\nthe album up with pointless guitar\nnoodling with slapdash references\nto money to make it sound slightly relevant. The Rakes have a fine\nexample in the form of 22 Grand\nJob, the confused thuggery on show\nin T-Bone, or, when all else fails,\njust shout randomly for five minutes:\nlisten to The Guilt if for some mad\nreason you\u2019re unsure on how to do\nthis. Be sure to include some reggae\ninfluences in there, everyone likes\nthose now (Violent).\nScruples are a lot like talking to\nyour neighbours; everyone gave that\nup ages ago. But if you still have\nsome, you might like to make the\neffort to include a few other catchy\ntunes; why not pen a heartfelt track\ncalled Open Book about the embarrassment of breaking-up complete\nwith a rocking pseudo glam-rock\nriff? If it goes well you can reuse it\nthroughout the entire album. Maybe\nyou can experiment with some electronica and turn it into an atmospheric piece called (with distinct\npunnage) Binary Love?\nSo now you\u2019re album is competed.\nCongratulations! Now all you have to\ndo is sit back, enjoy the praise from\nthe music press, and eat up the one\nyear of comfort until people realize\nyou\u2019ve released an album lacking\nin substance or real meatiness and\nthen attempt to burn out with dignity.\nMatty Hartfield\nIt is a real shame that Coldplay,\nour greatest British hope for worldwide \u201cindie\u201d success, have failed to\npush any boundaries with their latest album. Though people who don\u2019t\nencounter anything more challenging than the Sugababes won\u2019t have\never heard anything like Fix You,\nothers will realise that it is a very\nold and used formula. When Chris\nMartin said, \u201cpeople won\u2019t realise\nhow much we have stolen until they\nlisten to the album,\u201d I didn\u2019t realise\nhow literally he was using the word\n\u201cstolen.\u201d\nLuckily Leaves have come along\nand produced the album Coldplay\nshould have made. In its entirety,\nThe Angela Test is epic sounding\nand anthemic, yet imbued with majesty and ethereal qualities more\ncommon to fellow Icelanders Sigur\nRos. Instead of taking the \u201cone man\nat a piano straining his bollocks off\u201d\napproach to song writing, Leaves go\nfor rich orchestration, soulful vocals\nand spine-tingling chordality.\nBizarrely, the album starts with\ntheir most epic song, the jaw-drop-ping Shakma. It starts off melodic\nand yearning, with warm piano and\nsoft brass, yet explodes into snare-powered abandon, with more than a\nslight hint of post-rock. Last single\nThe Spell employs the same kind of\nmotivation as the end of Shakma,\nyet continued throughout and punctuated by cymbal heavy build-ups\nand choruses. The title track Angela\nTest is possibly the best song on\nthe album; synths shimmer softly\nand tense silences are left as the\nband adds very Icelandic backing\nvocals. It builds with percussion that\nsounds like a whole marching band,\ngiving the whole track a feeling of\nmagnificence.\nUnfortunately there are a few\ntracks that lack any sense of iden-tity. Silver Night is based around\none guitar riff, leaving it sounding very unremarkable, and The\nTransparent is similarly unexcep-tional. As We Walk goes nowhere in\nparticular and could be from their\ndebut album Breathe. On the con-trary, Good Enough and Whatever\nare a lot more rock than you would\nfind in their back-catalogue, utilising\nthe kind of pounding drums indie\nheavyweights Doves would. Killing\nFlies is actually quite a strange song,\nwith very simple piano, roiling time\nsignatures, those pounding drums\nagain and staccato strings. Still, it all\nsits together perfectly.\nOur country isn\u2019t quite ready to\nembrace a band from Iceland as\ntheir own, which means that this\nrelease will largely go unnoticed by\nall except the critics. If you\u2019re just\nstarting uni and want to get into\nsomething a bit different, you could\ndo worse than using The Angela Test\nas your starting point.\nJames Millen\nI will apologise in advance. Getting\nhold of a copy of the I Saw Such\nThings In My Sleep EP by new\nFantasticPlasticsigningsGuillemots\nis going to be tricky: limited to a run\nof 1000 CDs, it sold out in two weeks.\nalthough I do believe you can pick it\nup on Ebay for about ten times its\noriginal retail value.\nSo why the hype? Frankly, because\nthey are gorgeous. They make you\nsmile, they make you shiver and\nthey make every Belle & Sebastian\nalbum in your collection defunct.\nThe EP opens with the exuberant\nWho Left The Lights Off Baby, which\nsounds like what a cocktail party\ntastes like; bouncy piano driving it\nalong and a vaguely ridiculous (but\nstill ace) saxophone solo. The record\nbecomes much more chilled-out\nwith Cats Eyes, as the instrumentation drops down to lightly brushed\ndrums and echoed backing vocals.\nIf you listen carefully you notice that\nunderpinning it all are strings, bass\nclarinets and piano keys poured over\nthe track like warm toffee. Mmmm.\nMade Up Love Song #43 is almost\noverbearingly tender (work that one\nout), the soulful and earnest vocals\nof singer Fyfe starting it all off, singing about nonsense like \u201csparks and\nshining dragons\u201d, until you realise\nit\u2019s all a ploy to hide his feelings: \u201cI\nlove you, I don\u2019t think you care\u201d. As\nif to mend his broken heart the rest\nof the band join him with driving\ndrums and bass, angular guitars,\nethereal synth noises and heartwarming harmonies. Divine.\nYou know what? That ten times\nface value you will have to pay for\nGuillemots\u2019 first outing may well be\nworth it, because who knows how\nhigh that price will go? You\u2019ll be\nvery hard pushed to find a more self\nassured and wonderful debut, this\nband is almost spookily well formed.\nDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\nJames Millen\nMUSIC music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nCrapture/Re:leaves\nSilly pun headline introduces a thorough trashing of scene favourites The\nRakes, and a praising of Iceland\u2019s \ufb01nest, Leaves\nNew music:\nyou know we\nlove it\nDEMO REVIEWS\nAre you sick and tired of hearing\nthat the only things that Imperial\nguys can hold onto are their calcula-tors? And that our sense of humour\nleaves a lot to be desired? I am.\nFortunately, this evil stereotype is\nabout to be shattered, thanks to\nthe dirty, noisy and breaky sound\nfrom Dan and Ross of usedtobe-cool, (who, believe it or not, used to\npiss about in the Blackett and the\nHuxley, respectively and spin fire\nin the quad just like the rest of you\nmunters do).\nThink Daft Punk and Roni Size\nbefore they got fat and became\nfriends with the politically-correct\nlobby, give it the precise firing of\nTel Aviv\u2019s nuclear weapons pro-gramme, imagine glass shattering\ndue to an orgasm being that good\nand then you\u2019ve just about got it.\nIntelligent dance music at its best:\nSquarepusher in a word.\nThe breakcore kicks off atmos-pherically, with the futuristic Just\nThe Thing before descending further into a depraved world with the\nindustrial breakbeats of the intrinsically sexy Classically Trained\nGroupie. Robotik noizes take you\nto the next level on Magical Love\nAdventure before forcing you to\ndance, frantically, to It\u2019s Not You, It\u2019s\nYour Face. The beats are shit hot,\ngrindingly insistent; Nellee Hooper\nwould retreat back across the\nSevern into the valleys and end his\ndays in a Caerphilly cave if he could\nget hold of this stunner. Hell yes.\nThe sampling is irreverent to say\nthe least, cracking the listener up\nno end so that when you\u2019re dancing,\nmoshing, moving, you\u2019re bound to\nhave a smile on your face, especially\nwith the Paedofinder General and\nhis machine guns on Perversion\nFor Profit. Parentally explicit, probably not.\nVogue Says sees the guys getting\nperilously close to social commen-tary, screeching its way to oblivion\nbefore giving way to the hypnotic\nVisions Of Custard. This compels\nyou once more to the dancefloor,\nwith snare breaks taking care to\ndeconstruct a SouthWestNine vortex to keep you rapt. N00b tinkles\nits way into your consciousness\nand fails to leave. So too does the\ndeliciously bassy Grind Meh which\nkeeps you dancing the way a good\nAsian Dub Foundation track should,\nwith its rhythmic noise captivating\nyou to stick around for more. The\ncompelling beats, dirty snares and\nhumourous samples of yore are\npresent in droves on the distorted\njungle of Closet Bedwetter, but I\nsomehow can\u2019t force myself to like\nthis one. Canine Devotion and I\nLike You fare much better before\nthe junglistic Domination comes in\nto finish off a fantastic party with\nverve and vigour.

It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve not written before; we\u2019ll\ngive you a chance. Although the\nvast majority of music we are sent is\n\u201cindie\u201d and we\u2019re always in need of\nindie writers, there\u2019s still a substantial amount of chart and pop that\nwe receive and do not have writers\nwilling to review, so if you think you\ncould redress this balance, drop us a\nline (the email is at the end).\nThis year, there will be a few\nchanges to Music\u2019s format. We plan\nto start introducing writer\u2019s charts,\nso you can see what\u2019s currently floating our respective boats, debates\naround topical news from the music\nworld, and more demo reviews.\nHopefully, this should make Music\nless like a collection of reviews, and\nmore personal.\nLastly, this summer has been\nan excellent few months for new\nrecords.

We\u2019ve only had two\ndays of events so far and their enthusiasm would be very hard to rival (apologies to other\nyears, we love you too). Things kicked off with the BBQ on Sunday afternoon were it was\nlovely to see 300 freshers\u2019 eating to the point of vomit. Not content with eating 37 burgers\nin one sitting, one chap took a whole tray of left overs to see him through the week. Looks\nlike he\u2019s learnt the art of student life already.\nNow as for the Boat Party, not really sure where to start. One young lady managed to\nseduce the captain of the boat, much to the horror of all around them. Fortunately there\nwere no fatalities and no acute poisoning. Monday night saw the Freshers\u2019 Roadshow,\nthe annual induction to the medical school. If asked to describe it I\u2019d probably say it was a\nmix between Fun House and the sinking of the Titanic. Think Cupid may have paid a visit,\nas I\u2019ve never seen so many people smooching in the Reynolds in my life. A very randy\nbunch these young freshers!\nAnyhow, we\u2019ve still got another 10 events to go at the time of writing and we\u2019re hoping the\nnewbies continue to represent as well as they have. You guys are awesome, I love you\nall.\nDanny. x\nWhat\u2019s happening at the ICSMSU?\nImperial College Union, Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB. T: 020 7594 8060 www.union.imperial.ac.uk\nDanny McGuinnes - ICSMSU President\nNews from the Union...\nSameena Misbahuddin - President\nElections, Elections, Elections\nThis month sees a number of elections to Union Committees. So if you want to get involved and actually make a difference, then why not stand for election\u2026\nCouncil\nGovernance to many may seem boring,\u2026\u2026\u2026but if the Union is to work well then it is\nvital that we make it work effectively.\nCouncil is the governing body of the Union and is responsible for policy making and ensuring the Union is serving its students well. A variety of issues are dealt with at Council,\nfrom Fairtrade policy to student accommodation - dealing with issues concerning the\nwhole of the student body. Council is vital to everything we do \u2013 it tackles all the crucial\nissues and if we\u2019re to have any chance in challenging College decisions that we dislike,\nthen we must be able to present a united front.\nCouncil meets monthly and is open to all to attend. There are 16 remaining positions to\nbe \ufb01lled on this committee, of which at least two must be \ufb01rst years and two postgradu-ates, and for the rest a quota for each faculty.\nEqual Opportunities Of\ufb01cer\nThis of\ufb01cer will be responsible for ensuring that the Union\u2019s Equal Opportunities Policy is\nupheld, and sits on Council and Welfare committee.\nTrading & Retail Committee\nOversees commercial activities of the Union and is the place to go to represent student\nviews to ensure the bars, catering, shops and entertainments meet the needs of the stu-dents. 4 positions up are for grabs on this committee and it meets once a month.\nServices Committee\nOversees non-commercial services such as the Welfare service and services provided for\nClubs and Societies. 4 positions are up for grabs and it meets once a month.\nULU\nThere are up to 3 delegates for the University of London Union council to be voted for.\nDelegates need to attend the monthly meetings and ensure that Imperial\u2019s needs are being met by its parent university\u2019s Union and to work with other London Unions.\nFaculty elections\nSome Faculty Unions are also having elections for a variety of positions. Look out for\nposters relevant for your faculty. The elections timetable for Faculty elections is the same\nas central Union elections and all works on the same electronic voting system (accessible\nthrough the Imperial College Union website). However, you can not vote in other faculty\u2019s\nelections than your own (so don\u2019t try ;-) ).\nWhy not get involved?\nThinking of standing then?\nNominations for all these positions are open now and close on Friday October 14th. To\n\ufb01nd out more information about how to stand for these positions\nSee www.union.ic.ac.uk/elections.\nNominations to Executive Committee\nThe Executive Committee is the management board of the Union, meeting fortnightly and\noverseeing the Union operations. The committee consists of the Union President, Deputy\nPresidents, Faculty Union Presidents and Overseas students\u2019 committee chair. The\nCommittee will also have 2 representatives nominated from Student Activities committee\n(SAC), 1 from Welfare committee and 1 from Academic Affairs \u2013 these latter four are to\nbe nominated at the beginning of term, at and by the \ufb01rst meeting of each of the committees \u2013 to \ufb01nd the dates of these \ufb01rst meetings check www.union.ic.ac.uk/meetings.\nFreshers\u2019 Fair\nTuesday saw another successful Imperial College Union Freshers\u2019 Fair. A big thank you\ngoes out to all those who helped make it a success; all the CSC and Faculty Union committee members, the Sabbatical of\ufb01cers and Union staff members who helped throughout the day and all the Clubs and Societies who organised stalls and demonstrations\nwelcoming students to a new term. And a special thank you goes to Simon Matthews\n\u2013 Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) for organising the day.\nDON\u2019T HIDE FROM\nDISABILITY\nFOR INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICES AND FACILITIES AVAILABLE AT IMPERIAL TO HELP STUDENTS WITH\nDISABILITIES PICK UP A LEAFLET OR CONTACT THE INFORMATION & ADVICE SERVICE.\nT: 020 7594 8067 E:ADVICE@IMPERIAL.AC.UK\n\n"

The event had all the\nright settings for a fantastic time,\nbut as always everyone got over\nexcited and ridiculously drunk and\ncrowded round the closest female\npresent. Again the intake of women\nwas poor, but we were not really\nexpecting anything else! This is\nImperial College of Science and\nTechnology!\nHowever one attractive female\nwas spotted sporting a rather\neye-catching yellow top (first year\nmedic). But, The Union was rather\ndark at the time. I am keeping my\nfingers crossed\u2026I should have your\nnumber by the time this article is\nprinted so guys don\u2019t bother.\nIt is not often that you get told\nthat you are biggest, but it actually\nhappened to me recently. I met an\nextremely attractive girl and one\nthing led to another, and being in\na whirlwind of attraction we ended\nup in bed together. Everything\nT\nhe past week has been a\nhectic one in the wonderful\nworld of Stormy. Not only did\nI win Ebay tickets to see my second favourite boy band of all time\n(nobody beats Take That), but I also\ngot to spend time with my newest\ncrush (and no, it\u2019s not the drummer\nfrom Hoochie Coo, that\u2019s old news!),\nthe lovely Miss A.\nAnother girl(!), you say?\nIndeedly, as the good Mr Flanders\nwould say. Girlie crushes are a\nfeature of my life I don\u2019t often\ndiscuss. After all is said and\ndone, I can\u2019t treat them with the\nrespect I\u2019d like. Who would want\nto sign the lady she loves up to\nlife in a hostile family environ-ment? Mummy and Daddy Woods\nwould not be impressed, as they\nare acutely homophobic when it\ncomes to their own kids. What\nwould the elders at temple think?\nCulturally conservative efforts\ndo not impress me; a tradition\nmay have worked for the past\n6,000 years, but it shouldn\u2019t be\nimmune to questioning/altera-tion to make it relevant in this\nenlightened age. The whole thing\nsmacks of hypocrisy when my\nreligion itself is supportive of all\ncommitted loving relationships\nbetween consenting adults!\nUnfortunately, due a Nine West\nhabit thats left me in finacial hell,\nI can\u2019t afford not to live under my\nparent\u2019s roof if I\u2019m going to have\nany hope of completing my degree\n(those thoughts of Dr Stormy\nmolesting fit patients do keep me\ngoing!).

Seeing her around\ntotally makes my day \u2013 considerably more so than the district\nnurses Gulix mistakenly accused\nme of fancying! Fit nurses don\u2019t\nexist for starters; a good looking\nwoman can earn better money\nhyping upcoming pop-stars or\nselling over-priced property for\nthe dickheads in green graffiti-stricken Mini\u2019s.

Seriously,\nthough the new centre does look\nexcellent, and it makes us feel a little more loved by College.\nThe decision to make gym and\nswim free is particularly welcome\nat a time when being a student is\nbecoming more and more expen-sive.\nHowever, I am a little worried\nthat the centre will be full to bursting all the time. When something is\noffered for free everyone wants to\nget their \u2018money\u2019s worth\u2019 from it.\nNeil Mosley, has stated that they\nwill constantly review usage patterns and there is the possibility\nthat we will have to book just to use\nthe gym.\nWhat about sport centres at other\ncampuses?

So give it a go, you\nmight have the time of your life\nand not have to spend a penny.\nWe\u2019ve got all the usual\nfeatures too, including TV\nTitbits with wannabe TV star\nMatt Cunningham and Movie\nMondays with Duncan Pearse\nwhere you could win cinema\ntickets courtesy of our friends at\nOdeon Kensington.\n(Instru)Mental - Thursdays\n9-11pm\nDon\u2019t fancy another night of\ncheese at the union? Check out\n(Instru)Mental. Now in its third\nyear, we bring you the best in\nhard house, hard trance and hard\ntechno.\nThe first hour includes fea-tures, chat and the latest on\nwhat\u2019s happening in the hard\ndance world, while in the second\nexpect a back to back mix taking\nyou through the latest music for\nthe harder generation, as well as\nsome of the classics that got the\nhard scene going. Expect tracks\nfrom the likes Riot!, Tidy Trax\nand the mighty Vicious Circle.\nNext week: Beer & Biscuits\nIf you want to get involved in\nIC Radio, presenting your own\nshow or helping out behind the\nscenes, we\u2019ll be holding our\nannual Beer and Biscuits evening\non Thursday 13th October.\nLook out for more details in\nnext week\u2019s Felix.\nListen to IC Radio online at\nicradio.com or on 1134AM\nacross the Wye campus.\n9\nfelix\nThursday 6 October 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nLoisa Evans explains what being a part of Imperial\u2019s tv station is all about\nThe workshops consist of three\nsessions, each lasting about an\nhour. The first two involve producing a short light entertainment programme \u2013it tends to be quite chaotic\nbut it\u2019s always good fun. We\u2019re not\ntrying to produce a BAFTA award-winning entertainment show, just\ngive you an idea of how things work\nat stoic tv.\nStudio\nIn the studio you\u2019ll be able to\nhave a go at being a presenter.\nConfidence is a must as somehow\nyou need to talk to a camera as if\nit\u2019s a huge group of people watching\non a screen somewhere. The ability\nto talk non-stop is helpful, but you\nare largely at the mercy of the rest\nof the crew to feed you the information you need and do what you\nare expecting. There\u2019s nothing quite\nlike introducing a segment and then\nlooking in horror into the camera as\nyou realise there is no VT to play.\nFor the more reserved among us,\nwhy not have a go at controlling a\ncamera, as instructed by the programme\u2019s director. Or you could\nbe the floor manager \u2013 this person\nis essentially in charge of the studio and is responsible for making\nsure everyone knows what they are\ndoing, from telling the presenters\nwhich camera to look at to counting\ninto and out of video segments so\nthat the presenters know when to\nstop and start talking.\nGallery\nThe gallery is the nerve centre of\nany recording. It\u2019s here that you\u2019ll\nfind the boss, or the director. The\ndirector\u2019s job is to keep the whole\nshow on track \u2013 from deciding what\nthe cameras should do to cueing in\nvideo segments, or just telling the\npresenters to wrap it up because\nthey\u2019re being dull. If you like shouting and bossing people around then\nthis is the job for you, but at the\nsame time you need a cool head\nas you have to be thinking not just\nabout what is happening now, but\nalso about what is happening next.\nThe director works closely with\nthe vision mixer, who controls which\npictures go to tape (or to broadcast\nif it\u2019s a live show). There\u2019s also a\nsound mixer who does a similar\nthing for audio, and VT operators\nwho play in video footage such as\nmusic videos and interviews. They\nalso need to press record at the\nstart of the show, otherwise people\nwill get very upset when you tell\nthem that they have to it all again.\nEditing\nMost programmes need to go\nthrough post-production after being\nrecorded before they make it to the\nscreen. At its simplest, editing is\nsimply rearranging bits of video into\nthe right order and length. Then\nyou add captions, music, graphics,\nspecial effects\u2026. The list is endless.\nIt can take a very long time but the\nresults can be spectacular.\nTo give you a taster, we\u2019ll produce\na trailer for a film or TV show from\na set of clips we\u2019ve prepared. You\u2019ll\nget to call the shots, deciding what\ngoes where and how to make it look\nperfect.\nIf editing is your chosen art, then\nwe\u2019ll give you dedicated training on\nthe use of our suites so you know\nhow to do all the basics. All you need\nis creativity and imagination.\nInterested?\nIf all that sounds like fun, then\ncome and get involved. We\u2019ll be running two workshops: on Sunday 9th\nOctober and again on Wednesday\n12th October, both from 2pm. And\nbecause we all know that bribery\nworks, there\u2019ll be free food, beer and\nsoft drinks.\nGet Involved: Workshop Details\nmedia\n\n"

Most people know that diabetes stems from the body\u2019s inability\nto produce or respond to insulin to\nuse sugars. Less well-known is that\ninsulin is also a key stimulator of cell\ngrowth. Research has shown that\nmany different types of tumour cell\nare abnormally sensitive to insu-lin.

This\nyear most of the club\u2019s top athletes\nwere competing in fours: A coxless\nfour in the Visitors\u2019 Challenge Cup,\nand two crews in the Men\u2019s Student\nCoxed Fours \u2013 an event which the\nclub won last year, along with the\nremaining eight.\nFirst up on the Wednesday morning was the \u2018A\u2019 four, entered as a composite with Goldsmith\u2019s College (due\nto Ben\u2019s perhaps misguided fondness for arty stuff), who comfortably\ndisposed of Durham Uni \u2018B\u2019. Next\ncame some disappointment for the\neight, who were never really in their\nrace and consequentially lost out to a\ncrew from the holders Nereus. After\na spot of lunch it was the turn of the\nsecond coxed four, who had drawn\nold rivals Oxford Brookes\u2019 \u2018B\u2019 crew.\nHenley Royal Regatta 2005\nAs they passed our vantage point,\njust before halfway, our boys were\nover a length down and appeared to\nbe struggling. However, it\u2019s just not\nthe IC way to give up, so back they\ncame and in the space of the last\n500 metres rowed through Brookes\nto take the race by 1 length! So, a\ngood day all told, and with the fours\noff to get some well deserved rest,\nvarious members of the eight hit\nthe town for some alcohol induced\nshenanigans...\nThursday morning came easier for\nsome than others, and with just the\none IC crew competing (the coxed\nfours had a day off), this turned out\nto be the quietest day of the regatta.\nHannah Marshall\nTen days in Barcelona and Valencia\nsounds like a good holiday to most\npeople, but add to that the thought\nof ten days with 26 IC hockey play-ers, and you\u2019re pretty much in heav-en, right?! Well, I\u2019m not sure what\nthe Spaniards thought, but we had a\npretty good time.\nOur first stop was Barcelona:\nhome of Gothic, Gaudi and Human\nStatues.\nWith such a rich offering of culture,\nBarcelona easily absorbed five days\nof our time, as we took in sites such\nas La Sagrada Familia, Park Guell,\nthe Olympic Village, the Noucamp\nStadium. We also managed to spend\na bit of time at the beach, where\nEnglish cricket\u2019s summer of success really began, as ICHC managed to get even the Spanish people interested in their enthralling\nbeach-style simulation of the Ashes!\nIt should also be noted that\nBarcelona also boasts a world\nfamous Communications Tower,\nwhich delighted the more physics-orientated hockey players amongst\nus, giving them a chance to revel in\ntheir engineering roots amidst an\notherwise sports and culture orientated trip!\nBarcelona\u2019s nightlife also deserve\na mention. I think the words Sangria,\nAnyhow, the Visitors\u2019 four, a crew\nmade up of three of last year\u2019s winning four along with ex-IC man Tom\nGale, didn\u2019t disappoint with a comfortable victory over a crew from\nLake Victoria, South Africa.\nWith three crews still in the\nregatta on Friday, this was looking like a pretty good year for the\nclub. However the day didn\u2019t start\noff that well, with the second coxed\nfour coming up against a formidable\ncrew from Durham Uni (the eventual winners of the event) who looked\nin control throughout and took the\nwin by one length. There was better news for the first four, who went\nthrough with an \u2018easily\u2019 verdict\nat the expense of Okeanos, from\nHolland. Unfortunately, though, the\ncoxless four, crippled by the loss\nof Ed through illness, struggled\nto match a strong crew (also the\neventual winners) from the National\nUniversity of Ireland. So, one crew\nleft going into the weekend, and\nthe rest of us headed for the pub,\nand then onto the glorious Latinos\nnightclub, where I don\u2019t even think\nanyone managed to get into a fight!\nOn Saturday the focus was on\ntwo things: Firstly cheering on the\ncoxed four, and secondly drinking\nlots (of other peoples\u2019) Pimms. So\nfirst things first \u2013 they faced a determined Nat Uni of Ireland crew (a different one), who were always going\nto fight all the way to the line. As\nthe crews passed our (slightly ille-gal) gazebo, we were ahead and all\nlooked rosy, however the commentary told the story as NUI gradually\nclosed the gap, from _ of a length\nto _ a length, to _ of a length... But\ncould they hold on? The wait for\nthe final verdict was agonising, but\neventually it came: Victory for NUI\nby 1 foot! Yes, that\u2019s 1 foot in a 2,112\nmetre long course. Gutted.\nAnyway, on with the drinking, and\nwhen all our Pimms had gone, it was\non to the Barn Bar \u2013 an outdoor bar\nwith horrendous queues and extortionate prices \u2013 but hey, it\u2019s Henley.\nWhat followed was general drunken-ness, cavorting and revelry. Oh, and\nCharlie fell in the river.\nAfter the regatta most of the Boat\nClub went their separate ways, but\nenough stuck together to put in\na decent showing at the National\nChampionships in Nottingham a\ncouple of weeks later. A haul of 3\nsilver medals, in the mens Pairs,\nCoxed Fours and Eights representing a good end to the competitive\nseason for ICBC.\nAnyone interested in joining the\nBoat Club, whether you\u2019re male,\nfemale, big, small, and no matter\nhow much or little experience you\nhave of the sport, should get in\ntouch or keep an eye out for posters around college. For more information contact the club captain at\ncaptain@imperialboatclub.co.uk, or\nthe women\u2019s captain at womenscap\ntain@imperialboatclub.co.uk\nWe hope to see as many of you as\npossible over the coming weeks and\nmonths.\nSan Miguel, and Sangria pretty much\nsum it up! There was, however, also\nthe small matter of a fancy dress\nnight, which produced some interesting pictures, captured the hearts\nof Spanish Grandmothers and lead\nto a universal conclusion that men\nshould not wear hot pants!!\nOn this note, we thought it best\nto escape to Valencia, where we\nfocused our mind on the task ahead;\nwhich was to wow the Spanish hockey players with our supreme on-pitch skills. Unfortunately, despite\nacclimatisation training one June\nevening in Putney, nothing could\nprepare us for running around mid-afternoon in 35\u00ba heat! The Spanish\nproved to be better adapted for these\nconditions and despite some brilliant play by all the IC Tour Teams,\nthe Valencians emerged victorious.\nIn spite of the sun stroke and not\nwinning the matches, a couple of\ngood days of hockey were had by\nall, and most of us left the pitch\ncontent and in search of an evening\nof refreshment. JLo on the other\nhand, left with a school girl\u2019s mobile\nnumber and Shiv Henn left with a\nhole in her leg. But it was all good!\nHonest!!\nWhen we weren\u2019t playing hockey\nin Valencia, we occupied ourselves\nwith more beach action, mini tours\nof the old town, market, and walks\nalong the river bed, as well as once\nagain relishing the opportunity to\nexpand our scientific selves\u2026 The\nCity of Science managed to draw us\nin and make us think about Genetics\nand aeronautics again! There was,\nhowever, the added bonus of a rather nice aquarium, complete with\nDolphin Show to capture our attention and prove that learning really\ncan be fun!\nThe nightlife of Valencia also\nturned out to provide its fair share\nof entertainment; once again\nSangria, San Miguel and Sangria\napplied, with the addition of a bit of\nZambucca, and what started off as\nsome pretty good nights out turned\ninto excellent nights out, with the\nrealisation that there were no hot-pants on men in Valencia, and that\ndancing on bars is a near-manda-tory night-time activity!\nIt was certainly a sad moment\nwhen this year\u2019s Spain Tour had to\nend, and the Tour Family dispanded,\nbut 26 IC hockey players started\ntheir summer hols on a high and\nonly need to glance at the photos\non the website to burst into fits of\ngiggles, which is a sure sign that\nnext year\u2019s tour has a lot to live\nup to!!For more tour highlights and\nincriminating photos, take a look at\nwww.imperialhockey.co.uk\nTales from Two Cities!\nHockey on tour\nWANTED\nWebsite Designer\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nThe felix website needs a refit.\nAre you any good at web\ndesign?\ne-mail felix@imperial.ac.uk\nYou will get paid!\nAdvertising Manager\nFelix attracts a considerable\namount of advertising.\nWe need someone to deal\nwith advertising bookings and\ninvoicing customers.\nIt will look great on your CV!\ne-mail felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nfelix\nThursday 6 October 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nsportlatest.indd 2 5/10/05 1:20:12 pm\n\n"

    "content": "Caesar and Machiavelli. However,\nsomething is lost in Revolver \u2013 and\nit isn\u2019t just the plot.\nCon man and gambling extraordi-naire Jack Green (Jason Statham\n- does it even matter what his characters are named anymore?) gets\nout of prison after being screwed\nby his previous boss, Macha (Ray\nLiotta), and quickly screws him back\nat Macha\u2019s casino in a game of flip-the-coin. Macha quickly dispatches\na couple of hit men (one of whom\nlater provides the only entertaining\nscene in the whole movie) to remove\nthe insult, but Green is saved by two\nmysterious characters, Avi and Zach\n(played by Benjamin and Pastore),\nwho pull Green along in a bizarre,\nconfusing plot that doesn\u2019t seem to\nculminate in anything.\nIt\u2019s difficult to pin down why\nRevolver is a terrible film. The\nmovie is long, and the plot is pointless and confusing, but Ritchie\u2019s\nprevious hits were arguably similar.\nThe directing is still original and\nstylish \u2013 though noticeably more\nexperimental and less sure of itself.\nThe acting talent is in abundance\nand all of the main characters give\na strong showing. Even the music\nis great. However, there must be\nsome concept of reverse-synergy\nO\nriginal writer and\ndirector Guy Ritchie\nand charismatic everyman Jason Statham\nreally had something\ngoing on with Lock, Stock, and\nTwo Smoking Barrels (1998) and\nSnatch (2000). Pair the two up\nagain, add the sneering and intimidating Ray Liotta, mob essential\nVincent Pastore, and serious new\ntalent Andre Benjamin (the half\nof Outkast who acquitted himself\nrespectably in Four Brothers this\nyear), and Revolver should be an\nace in the hole, right?\nNot at all. Perhaps the fact that\nJason Statham has hair is the first\nindication of Ritchie\u2019s departure\nfrom the formula that we enjoyed\nso much in his previous films. Or\nmaybe it\u2019s the opening quotes from\nGuy Ritchie is back! (Or not...)\narts.\nIt\u2019s nothing like Barrels or Snatch. Don\u2019t revolve... just avoid\nwhere the combination of acting,\ndirecting, cinematography, and writing is monumentally less than the\nsum of its parts. In fact the theme\nof the movie seems to be talent and\ncreativity put to waste. The scene\nin which Green fights his inner self\ninside an elevator is a microcosm\nfor the whole movie: it\u2019s artistically\nand originally done, yet it\u2019s boring\nand drags on tortuously.\nPerhaps that\u2019s because the film\nmakes the audience wonder whether they\u2019ve missed something, or\nwhether the scene they saw last\nhas nothing to do with anything.\nPerhaps that\u2019s because the film\ndelves too deeply into the mind of\nthe main character for the audience\nto relate or attach to him. Maybe it\u2019s\nbecause the character interaction is\nactually very limited, unlike Barrels\nand Snatch, denying us the humorous and enjoyable back-and-forth\ndialogue. It might even be because\nthe film attempts to be dark, pen-sive, introspective, spiritual, com-plicated, original, and creative, but\nforgets to make an attempt to be\nentertaining. In that case, the best\nword to describe it is pretentious.\nOr boring.

    "content": "A\nfter viewing the ever-sickening devastation in Bali, President Susilo\nBambang Yudhoyono stated at a\nnews conference that: \u201cThe terrorists are still looking for soft targets\u201d.\nThe potential for fear to overcome the usually\nrational minds of humanity is starkly obvious.\nMany deny it, but a global climate of fear has\nbeen created. We feel it here in London. Muslims\nfeel it when they are told that MI5 has agents in\nevery mosque in the country. Imperial Students\nfeel it when Education Secretary Ruth Kelly tells\nour Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, to \u201cidentify and\nconfront unacceptable behaviour\u201d right here\non campus, and Muslim community leaders are\nasked to help \u201cidentify and isolate\u201d potential\nextremists.\nWhat is an extremist? Am I an extremist? I\u2019m\nMuslim. Everyone is telling me that this is fine.\nIf I were old and wise, I would remember the\nearly 1950s, a time when every loyal member\nof the United States would affirm their patriotism by making sure that no slither of socialism\nwas present in their family, friends, neighbours\nand in fact anyone they knew. The \u2018Red Scare\u2019\npushed society to pressure individuals from\n\u2018deviant\u2019 political or social views towards the\npopular view, even by suspending some civil\nliberties, with the poor excuse of preserving\nnational security. The pertinent question one\nmust ask is whether this is an example of history\nstarting to repeat itself.\nOn Friday 5 August 2005, Prime Minister Blair\nmade a speech announcing proposals for new\nanti-terror legislation. The measures were disproportionately aimed at the Muslim community\nin Britain, as they included plans to shut down\nmosques, proscribe Hizb ut-Tahrir despite them\nbeing a non violent political party, to draw up\na list of unsuitable Muslim clerics who would\nbe excluded from Britain and also to establish\nan \u2018Extremism Taskforce\u2019 to set standards for\nImams that remain.\nThere was also the alarming move to extend\nthe maximum period of detention without trial\nfrom fourteen days to three months. Personally,\nI do not believe the Government has the public\nsupport to pass measures that would isolate a\nBritish citizen for a three month detention. It\ninfringes on human dignity and is ultimately a\nrather reactionary move.\nWhat concerns me most is the notion that \u201cglorifying terrorism\u201d or \u201cpreaching hatred\u201d will be\nconsidered a crime. The point of discussion and\ndebate is to overcome differences and to understand those of different points of view. In these\nstrange times, we must endeavour to remain as\nopen-minded and frank as possible to genuinely\ncomprehend others. One example could be the\nState of Israel. This issue encompasses religion,\npolitics, human tragedy and misconceptions on\nall sides. Many actively support it, others make\nthemselves deal with it, yet others oppose it.\nWhat is inappropriate is to forbid debate. The\nnightmare is this: if these measures are adopted,\nthoughts will be considered a crime. The fear\nof being caught by proposals against \u201cindirect\nincitement to terrorism\u201d, \u201cglorification of terror\nacts\u201d or \u201cunacceptable behaviour\u201d could only\ncurtail the freedom of thought. Opposition and\npolitical dissent will effectively be outlawed.\nThe idealism that I subscribe to will not sit\nwell with some. I\u2019ve been told by many to stay\nquiet, to not \u201crock the boat\u201d. I would like to see\nthis attitude dispelled. Even though studying\nat a science institute gives us ample opportunity to ignore the wider world, I hope that we\ncan remember the plight of minorities who\nwere dehumanised for draconian legislation to\nbecome law. Muslims can feel the spotlight on\nthem now, but we all realise that the oppressed\nminority tomorrow could be another defenceless\nminority. Mr Blair, I will not let you change the\nrules of the game (a copy of this week\u2019s Felix\nhas been sent to the Prime Minister). A society,\nwhich recognises and adapts to meet the changes of our time, is a challenge that I would relish.\nO\nh no, my friends, it is not an option,\nit is essential! It was my good friend\nand Felix Editor, Mr R Neate, who\nfirst suggested this idea to me. At\nfirst, I did not see the necessity, but\nthat was when I was a student!\nSince then I have started working, and I have\nnot seen an episode of Neighbours for three\nweeks! Today is the first day I have had a chance\nto, and that is only because I am off work sick\nand trust me, even Neighbours is not worth\nstaying up all night vomiting for (occasionally,\nmaybe, but not regularly!) Plus, if I do it too\nmuch, I may get the sack, which would be a\nshame because I actually do enjoy my work.\nNowadays, I don\u2019t get to watch much TV at all\nduring the week except for late night TV, and\nI can\u2019t stay up too late because I have to be at\nwork by 8.45am (God, I\u2019m old!) On weekends,\nhowever, I do lounge around on my sofa and\nwatch quite a lot of Channel Four (I\u2019m really into\nLost and The O.C.). The only soaps I can watch\nare Hollyoaks, Home & Away and Eastenders.\nNow Hollyoaks is brilliant, attractive people and\nsome wonderful storylines; Home & Away has\neven more attractive people (Oh Tasha, you shall\nbe mine), and what it lacks in storylines it makes\nup for by the pure number of beauties who\nappear to live in the tiny village of Summerbay.\nThe Home & Away omnibus is on Saturdays and\nHollyoaks on Sundays, so it works well, (obvi-ously the people at Channels 4 and 5 had a chat).\nI do, however, have a problem with the BBC\nbothering to screen an omnibus of Eastenders.\n\u2018Enders is crap and no one is talking about it!\nAdd on to that the fact that is on at 7.30pm or\n8.00pm, so even I could watch it during the week\nif I wanted to! So why do we need a omnibus?\nOh why, oh why, oh why? I think its because its\na British soap and the BBC feel they should use\nBritish TV. Personally I would dispose of the\nremaining Mitchells and the Slaters and dear old\nDot Cotton and put Neighbours in their Sunday\nafternoon slot. Even if they insist on keeping\nEastenders on then, why not put Neighbours on\nSaturday?\nThey could even pit it against Home & Away\nto discover which is the true Ozzie giant!\nPersonally I would bet on Ramsay Street, the\npeople aren\u2019t as hot (not since Holly Valance\nand Delta Goodrum left), but the storylines are\nso much better! Actually, now I come to think\nabout it, we should take the actors from Home\n& Away and make them perform Neighbours\nstorylines, that would be brilliant. Of course, we\ncan\u2019t replace Harold, Lou, Susan, Karl, Paul or\nToadie, but, let\u2019s face it, I would much rather\nsee Rebecca Cartwright performing the role of\nJanae Timmins.\nAnyway, enough of that, it\u2019s not going to\nhappen. What can, and must, happen is a\nNeighbours omnibus! So please, for me, for\nyourselves in the future when you have jobs,\ncampaign for a Neighbours omnibus. Just pick\nup a pen and write to the Director General of the\nBBC, (it\u2019s not like you have much else to do in\nlectures!).\nMark Thompson\nBBC Director-General\nWhite City\n201 Wood Lane\nLondon\nW12 7TS\nmark.thompson@bbc.co.uk\nW\nhen I heard the news reports last\nyear, recounting how a prisoner\nserving time for rape had won\n\u00a37m on the Lottery, my psychic\nradar went into overdrive. I had\nvisions of mass tabloid headlines exclaiming\nexaggerated hostility towards perpetrator Iorworth Hoare. The Sun never fails to disappoint\nme when it comes to predictability, and I expect\nmedia hype once more now that Hoare has been\nreleased back into society, where he\u2019s now free\nto spend his money as he pleases. Apparently it\nis also costing the public purse thousands each\nweek to keep his new identity a secret.\nI can see the headlines now: \u2018We caught the\nbastard! Then let him go. And now he\u2019s spending his millions. He just bought himself a pair of\npants.\u2019 Shocking Stuff!\nUnfortunately, luck and fairness aren\u2019t syno-nyms. My friends in Math Soc will probably\nargue that luck doesn\u2019t even exist. I once stayed\nup all night working on my GCSE coursework,\nand my teacher was sick the next day, hence the\ndeadline was extended. As you can imagine, I\nwasn\u2019t particularly happy and extremely envious of everyone who didn\u2019t bother and still got\na better grade than me. Its a childish jealousy\nparallel to this which is plaguing the minds\nof those shouting: \u2018Dirty rapist! How dare he\nwin the Lottery? I deserve to win, damn it!\u2019.\nIncidentally, a woman undergoing cancer treatment won the highest Lottery jackpot ever, just\naround the same time as Hoare.\nThe lottery is just that \u2013 a lottery. It doesn\u2019t\ncare if a rich person gets richer, so why care\nwhen a convicted criminal wins? Does the lottery need a new set of rules to decide who is\nworthy? If so, I think poor students need prior-ity!\nVictim support groups have already expressed\nanger at the win. One feminist writer even went\nas far to say that Hoare \u201cshould give every single penny of that money to rape crisis organisations\u201d.\nWhy? Hoare broke the law, and was conse-quentially punished by imprisonment, not confiscation of earnings. He has paid his metaphorical debt to society; why are people hell bent on\nsuing him/cajoling him into giving the money\naway? He paid for his ticket, and he contravened neither the rules of the National Lottery\nnor the terms of his punishment. He didn\u2019t even\nhave access to the money until he had finished\nserving his sentence in full. Fair enough, eh?\nUnfortunately, our puritanical society just\ncan\u2019t hack it, and would prefer that High Court\njudgements be arbitrarily altered to divert such\nwinnings to a criminal\u2019s victims.\nExactly how do they envisage the precise\ndefinitions of such a law? And where do they\ndraw the line? What if Hoare had bought his\nticket before he had been convicted? What if\nhe hadn\u2019t won? Is he only held responsible for\nall the crimes of his past once he starts getting\nsome dosh? Is prison not enough? Will financially depriving criminals reduce crime rates?\nPrecisely how much compensation will make\nvictims feel better?\nAs a student, I can see why he doesn\u2019t want to\ngive the money away, even if he is sorry for his\ncrimes. Good luck to him, I say. I optimistically\nhope he\u2019s realised the error of his ways and\nmanages to avoid the paparazzi as he buys his\nmorning paper.\nIt\u2019s all very well being self-righteous when\none\u2019s never had such large amounts of mind-corrupting cash, but \u00a37m is a lot of money to\ngive away. How many of you would?\nA Neighbours omnibus is not an option\nWhy can\u2019t a rapist win The Lottery?\nIain Heaton\nAnushri Patel\nOmar Hashmi\nMuslims are today\u2019s soft targets\n14\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 6 October 2005\n14-15-1329.indd 2 5/10/05 12:47:44 pm\n\n"

The centre will\nbe equipped with Fitlinxx personal\ncomputerised fitness equipment.\nThis equipment will recognise you\nevery time you come to work-out\nand set your individual program.\nThe centre will also house a multipurpose sports hall, climbing hall,\nsquash courts, dance studio, sports\ninjury clinic and juice bar. The\nsports hall will be the size of five\nbadminton courts and will come the\nNational Centre of Excellence for\nBadminton.\nThese additional facilities will not\nbe free to use, but will be \u201ccompetitively priced to encourage involvement in sport\u201d. The centre will also\noffer many sport classes, such as\nmartial arts and aerobics.\nEvery user, no matter how experi-enced, will have to undergo an induction session before they are allowed\nto use the equipment. Mosley does\nrecognise that it will take along time\nto induct all students and staff and\nwill be drafting in extra staff to quell\nanticipated frustrations. Induction\nwill also cost \u00a37.\nThe centre was initially scheduled\nto open at the start of this academic year, but was delayed as piling\ninto the existing foundations of the\nold 1960s centre took longer than\nexpected.

According\nto The Times Good University\nGuide, academically they are the\ntop four UK Universities.\nOxford topped the league, with\nCambridgeinsecondplace,Imperial\ncame a close third, with 958 points\ncompared to Cambridge\u2019s 983.\nSurprisingly, in a separate enter-tainemnt league Imperial has been\nranked fifteenth. LSE tops the\nleague, followed by King\u2019s College\nand Bath.\nThe league table is based on the\nsocial services available to stu-dents. Factors include the proximity of shops, pubs, off-licences,\nnight clubs, discos, fancy dress\nhire , pizza delivery and takeaway\noutlets.\nThese criteria may explain why\nImperial rates more highly than\nmost Imperial students would\nexpect. Imperial is in London,\nand as such is close to a plethora\nof entertainment services. The\nleague, compiled by Yell.com, rates\nall London Univeristies highly\ndue to ease of transportation and\naccess to round-the-clock ameni-ties.\nFinalist not Satsified\nA Sunday Times survey judging\nthe satsifaction of final-year students has rated Imperial in the\nbottom ten.\nThe survey found that students\nat campus-based Univerisities\nwere more satsified, including\nthe University of East Anglia and\nLoughborough.\nHowever, the validility of the 22-question survey is brought into\nquestion as many students boycotted the survey. Students from\nOxford, Cambridge, Warwick and\nScottish univeristies did not par-ticipate.\nIn stark contrast to the results\nof the entertainment survey eight\nof the bottom ten are in London.\nStudents widely agree that the;\nextortionate rent, highcrime rates,\nlong commutes and the need to\ntake part-time jobs affected their\nretrospective view of university\nlife.\nOne student, who owes \u00a315,000\nbut admits the course was excellent stated that; \u201cif I were starting again next September, when\nstudents pay \u00a33,000 fees a year, I\nmight go elsewhere\u201d.\nCracking start to Freshers\u2019 week\nA new cohort of freshers\u2019 started\nat Imperial this week, and the \u201cbiggest piss-up of your life\u201d got off to\na great start at the union on Saturday night.\nAnxious young freshers started\narriving at halls of residence at\n7am Saturday morning.

    "content": "R\nevolver has been dissed\nleft and right by critics everywhere (even\nFelix). What does Guy\nRitchie have to say to\nabout his disaster of a movie?\nWhere did the inspiration for\nRevolver come from?\nIt was a culmination of concepts\nreally, but a germ got stuck in my\nmind about one particular concept:\nthe con of all cons. I\u2019m fascinated\nby how you can trick the mind and\nthe individual, and this concept\nwas so audacious, so radical, that I\nwas attracted to say the least. The\nformula of the con is quite simple\n\u2013 you seduce people by their own\ngreed. We can all be conned but\nat what point do we realize that\nwe\u2019re being conned, and to what\nextent do we actually allow ourselves to be conned? There was a\nfamous book called The Big Con,\nwhich works on the formula that it\nis impossible to con an honest man.\nI was attracted to that idea too. The\ngreat challenge then was to take an\nintellectual concept and clothe it\nin an exciting, action-packed narrative because concepts are not necessarily interesting to look at. It\u2019s\nimportant that the film delivers on\nan entertaining level. What you want\nin the cinema is entertainment but\nI like to be intellectually titillated\nwhile being sensorially stimulated.\nIt took me three years to write this\nfilm whereas Snatch took me three\nmonths. Fundamentally, it\u2019s not a\nvery complicated film \u2013 it\u2019s actually\nquite simple \u2013 but to clothe it within\na narrative was quite complicated.\nThe film opens with Jake Green\ngetting out of jail. Would you say\nthat it ends with him enjoying\nanother kind of liberation?\nThe film starts off with a jailbreak\nand ends with a jailbreak because\nall the skulduggery going on inside\nhis head didn\u2019t allow him to know he\nwas still incarcerated. That\u2019s what\nthe film is about: the ultimate jailbreak and the radical actions one\nneeds to undertake to liberate oneself from this jail. It tells the story\nof the skulduggery and head-trick-ery that accompanies Jake on his\njourney, and the seemingly unlikely\nactions our hero has to undertake to\nbreak out of his jail.\nWhy did you call it Revolver?\nI\u2019ve always been surprised that\nno other movie has ever been called\nRevolver because it just sounds\ncool. So I like the name but I also\nlike the concept that, if you\u2019re in a\ngame, it keeps revolving until you\nrealize that you are in a game and\nthen maybe you can start evolving.\nThe film is based on the formula of\na game: where does the game start,\nwhere does it stop and who\u2019s conning who.\nA \u2018Revolving\u2019 discussion\nGuy Ritchie attempts to explain himself\nIs it a film with a message?\nA central idea is that there is no\nsuch thing as an external enemy.\nJake Green is playing against Jake\nGreen. That\u2019s quite a hard concept\nto get your head around initially: of\ncourse, if there is only an internal\nenemy, he wouldn\u2019t want you to get\nyour head around it. So it\u2019s based\non the formula that you can only get\nsmarter by playing a smarter oppo-nent. Who is the ultimate opponent?\nYourself. Then comes the principle\nthat your enemy will always hide in\nthe last place that you would ever\nlook. The last place you would look is\ninside your head and the last place\nyou would look inside your head\nis behind fear. I\u2019m not saying that\nformula\u2019s correct, it\u2019s just a formula\nand I\u2019m interested in formulas. In\nthis particular instance, the only\nopponent Jake Green has to challenge is himself by doing exactly\nwhat he doesn\u2019t want to do.\nTo that extent, are his experiences\nan allegory for life?\nIt\u2019s strange: I never expected as\na writer-director to end up talking\nabout high-falutin\u2019 concepts. I got\ninto film production because I was\ninterested in making entertaining\nmovies, which I felt there was a lack\nof. Jake Green isn\u2019t just Jake Green.\nJake represents all of us. The colour\ngreen is the central column of the\nspectrum and the name Jake has all\nsorts of numerical values. All things\ncome back to him within the film\u2019s\nworld of cons and games. Jake\u2019s on\na journey of how to play the game.\nHe\u2019s very good at playing games and\nhe\u2019s done very well out of playing\nby a certain formula but he didn\u2019t\nrealize how big and consistent that\nformula is. He only saw the formula\nin its microscopic form and didn\u2019t\nrealize that it could be macroscopic.\nOf the various formulas that make\nup the rules of the game, do you\nhave a favorite?\nI suspect my favorite line is, \u201cYou\ncan only get smarter by playing a\nsmarter opponent.\u201d My next one\nwould be, \u201cThe greatest enemy will\nhide in the last place you would\never look.\u201d The third one would be,\n\u201cThe harder the battle, the sweeter\nthe victory.\u201d My fourth would be,\n\u201cAlways protect your investment\u201d\nwhich would become, \u201cAlways protect your investment whether it\u2019s in\nyour interest or not.\u201d\nChess is a prime example...\nThe rules in chess are consistent\nwith the rules of all cons. I like the\nidea that the characters could all be\ndifferent pieces on a chess board. I\nthink we all embody the attributes of\npawns, bishops, knights and castles,\nkings and queens. It\u2019s just a question of, do we decide to be a pawn, or\ndo we decide to be a queen? I didn\u2019t\nchoose to be the latter particularly,\nbut there are different aspects to\nour personality and nature that the\nchess board represents, which is\nmaybe why chess is such a popular and ancient game. I\u2019m a very\nbad chess player, by the way. Jason\nStatham has probably been blowing\nhis own trumpet about what a qualified chess player he is. In fact, he\u2019s\nan appalling chess player.\nAnd the fact that the face-off\nbetween Jake and himself, his\ninternal enemy, takes place on the\n13th floor?\nThe elevator starts at 32 and stops\nbetween 14 and 12. In America,\nbuildings still don\u2019t have a 13th floor.\n13\u2019s a curious number. Quite how\nit got its unpopular reputation is a\nmystery and one I would quite like\nto have solved. Mythologically, it\u2019s\nthe luckiest number; it\u2019s the number\nof liberation. From a point of view\nof Jake\u2019s incarceration, what better place to liberate yourself than\nfloor 13, which doesn\u2019t even exist\nin an elevator? It just seemed like\nthe perfect environment in which\nto meet your demon. A number that\ndoesn\u2019t exist that is also the number\nof liberation.\nThat scene is one of the most\nimpressive in the whole movie...\nIt\u2019s my favorite scene in the film\nand I actually shot it three times.\nIt initially had four lines written for\nit. When we got in there, we spent\ntwo hours messing around, trying\nto draw as much as I could out\nof Jason. I realised we\u2019d got into\nsomething that was very interesting\nand in the end I could probably have\nfilmed 45 minutes of him screaming\nat himself in there.\nHow did you create that transatlantic atmosphere? Did you use a\nlot of special effects?\nUnlike my previous movies, there\u2019s\nquite a lot of studio work on this one\nbecause of the very nature of the\nfact that I wanted an environment\nthat\u2019s transcontinental. Because\nof that we had to revert to green\nscreen. I don\u2019t care whether I use\nspecial effects or not. My principal\njob is to make interesting and entertaining films, and I\u2019m not proud of\nwhich format or which particular\ntechnique I use. I just wanted the\nfilm to look good and that was about\nthe only request I had of my DP\n.\nWe wanted it to be slightly over the\ntop in terms of photography. What I\nliked about American movies when\nI was a kid was that they\u2019re sort of\nlarger than life, and I think I\u2019m still\nsuffering from that reaction. Tim,\nthe DP\n, was completely unbridled by\nme. The cheekier he got, the more I\napplauded him. He\u2019s his own boss in\nthat department.\nfilm.felix@iimperial.ac.uk\nSo you don\u2019t fit the stereotype of\nthe dictatorial filmmaker?\nIf somebody has a better idea than\nme, I\u2019ll take it if it surpasses what\nwe have on the page because at the\nend of the day, it\u2019s me that takes the\ncredit anyway! I\u2019ve been working\nwith lots of these guys for ten years\nnow and I\u2019ve become very aware of\nhow much the team has to do with\nthe creative process. I\u2019m not under\ntoo much of an illusion of how smart\nor un-smart I am because filmmaking ultimately is about teamwork.\nI enjoy the process and I\u2019ve usually done quite a lot of preparation\nbefore I arrive on set so I\u2019m not a\ntouchy filmmaker and I\u2019m not an\nanxiety-ridden filmmaker, at least\nwhile I\u2019m shooting the film. If you\nenjoy things, it tends to quell your\nnegative traits.\nYou\u2019ve also worked with Jason\nStatham on almost all your\nfilms...\nApart from the fact that I don\u2019t\n13\nfelix\nThursday 6 October 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\ufb01lm\nlike him, don\u2019t trust him and have\nno respect for him as a chess\nplayer, Jason and I work quite well\ntogether. Actually, Jason forced me\ninto using him. He threatened me\nwith violence. The rest of the cast I\nhave more affection for. Andr\u00e9 was\na pleasure to work with. In fact,\n95% of the people in my films have\nbeen nothing less than a pleasure\nto work with. That goes for Jason,\ntoo. I like him and because I like\nhim, it\u2019s much easier to work with\nhim.

Let\u2019s explain what\nyou need to do:\n1. Find some friends, preferably ones\nwith an in-depth knowledge of late eighties\nWWF and the films of Rick Moranis.\n2. Think of a hillarious team name, the\nmore pun-tastic the better.\n3. Get a Felix. Not hard, they\u2019re every-where.\n4. Work out the answers to our \u2018hillarious\u2019 questions.\n5.

No longer will\nyour evenings be spent exploring the uncharted territories\nof London\u2019s seedy underbelly.\nNo, instead you\u2019ll be spending\nfar too much time in halls.\nLiving in halls will be a new\nexperience for a lot of you, and\nis one of the defining aspects\nof your time at university.\nTherefore, it\u2019s pretty important to make the most of it.\nIf you\u2019re unlucky you\u2019ll have\nbeen thrown together with\nroomate. More often than not\nour oh-so-wise hall wardens\ndecide to match up completely incompatible people\nin some misguided effort to\nwiden social horizons.

By now\nyou should be past the initial ice-breaker stage (\u201cWhat\nwere your A-Levels again?\u201d)\nand onto actual terrifying\nconversation and socialising.\nNow\u2019s the time for prooving\njust how cool you are, and as\neverybody knows, the ultimate\nbarometer of cool is The Hoff.\nGuess Who\nDo you hate Coffee Break? You think you can do better? Well, I'd like to see you try...\nWe\u2019re always looking for writers and Contributors here at Felix, and Coffee Break is no exception.

Last week I was\nin a happy relationship with my\ngirlfriend from home. Now I\u2019ve\ncome to uni and I\u2019ve met someone\nelse. I really like this person but I\nstill love my girlfriend, but she\u2019s\nnot here. Kissing doesn\u2019t count as\ninfidelity does it??\nTorn up tom\nDear torn up tom,\nDoes kissing count as infidelity??\nUmm how about a big fat whopping\nyes! Cheating is cheating whether\nit\u2019s a full blown orgy on a drunken\nnight out, or a tame kiss behind\nthe bike shed. You\u2019re still being\nunfaithful. If you\u2019re really considering being with this other girl, you\nobviously don\u2019t care as much for\nyour girlfriend as you say. Unless of\ncourse you have an open relation-ship, which by the way isn\u2019t really\na relationship, but I won\u2019t get into\nthat one right now.\nI think the best thing is to firstly\nsit down and talk to your girlfriend\nand see what she\u2019s really expect-ing. Maybe the best thing for you\nboth is to take a break, yes I know\nthat ended in disaster for Ross and\nRachel, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll manage.\nComing to uni already being part\nof a relationship is never easy, as\nyou\u2019re both going to be experiencing new things and growing apart,\nmaybe these new feelings are the\nfirst sign of that.\nDear miss C,\nI\u2019ve just moved into halls, and all is\ngoing great, but I\u2019m finding it very\nhard to get any sleep. The person\nin the room below me plays R&B\nfrom dusk till dawn every night.\nThe base is driving me crazy. I\u2019m\nreally little and he\u2019s really big and\nI just have no idea what to do. I\u2019m\nafraid he\u2019ll just ignore me and everyone will think I\u2019m a killjoy. What\ndo you suggest?\nSleepless in South ken.\nDear Sleepless in South ken,\nWell at least if you have to kept up\nall night its good music, that has to\ncount for something right!? Now\nyou mentioned that you\u2019re really\nlittle and this guy is huge, but I\u2019m\nsure that he isn\u2019t going to be a\nbrute and yell at you and be mean.\nI\u2019m sure that if you ask him he\u2019ll\nbe decent and at least turn off the\nsubwoofers. Halls is all about learning to live with each other, but if\nyou really are that scared you could\nalways try talking to your sub-war-den or re-apps.Trust me though, it\nwill be so much better coming from\nyou, at least this way he won\u2019t have\nto call out the crew from back home\nto have you beaten up(not that he\nwould).\nYou\u2019re not being a killjoy; everyone\nknows that a girl needs her beauty\nsleep, hours of relaxation guaranteed to stop you from biting people\u2019s\nheads off. If you talk to them and\nask, they\u2019ll most probably thank\nyou for it in the long run, anything\nis better than having to put up with\na girl on the warpath due to lack of\nsleep. Another way to show you\u2019re\nnot a killjoy is to start a prank war,\nbut be warned you may end up with\nmore than you bargained for.\nDear miss Con,\nOh my god! I\u2019m in a panic. My\nroommate has discovered my awful secret, and so soon after we\nmet! She\u2019s found my collection\nof\u2026\u2026\u2026. Mills and Boon books!\nAnd I think she\u2019s shown it to her\nboyfriend. I haven\u2019t spoken to her\nabout it yet, but I just don\u2019t know\nwhat to say. I need to stop her telling people. I hope she doesn\u2019t think\nI\u2019m a weirdo.\nFearful fresher\nDear Fearful fresher,\nThe words \u2018slightly too much information\u2019 come to mind. Now I can\nsee how this incident rates highly\non the cringe factor, but at least it\nwas just a soppy romance book, it\ncould have been so much worse.\nHey it\u2019s not an awful secret, so you\nlike to curl up and disappear into\na fantasy world with tall, dark, impossibly romantic men, who make\nwomen swoon at first glance.\nAt least you\u2019re not some psychopathic killer or part of a nudist cult,\nwhich would be so much worse\nfor your roommate. They are just\nbooks, unless of course you\u2019re writing Mills and Boons as code for a\nbattery operated tool!? In which\ncase it\u2019s natural and I\u2019m sure that\nyou\u2019re not the first and you won\u2019t\nbe the last. Now I understand that\nyou\u2019re embarrassed, but the fastest way for this to blow over is to\nact like there is no problem, just\ndon\u2019t make a big deal out of it! If she\nmakes a big deal out of it, just raid\nher side of the room for incriminating evidence.\nDear Miss Confidentiality,\nThere\u2019s this girl, I think she likes\nme but I\u2019m not sure. She\u2019s dropped\nher books on my feet six times already this week, I can\u2019t figure out if\nshe\u2019s just really clumsy or trying to\nget my attention. I often catch her\nlooking my way during lectures,\nbut I can\u2019t tell, my friends tell me\nshe may just have a squint. Its not\nthat I\u2019m not interested, I just don\u2019t\nwant to make a fool out of myself.\nShall I ask her out?\nHarvey\nDear Hopeful Harvey,\nMate are you serious!? Does she\nlike you? Umm that would be a yes!\nNo questions! Do you need your\nfeet to be anymore bruised? Come\non, I mean how many hints can a\ngirl drop, she could always wonder\nround wearing a sandwich board\nwith the words \u2018Harvey I like you,\nask me out\u2019 printed on it, but that\nwould be taking it a bit too far. The\npoor girl has lost her grip on subtlety and you\u2019re being the standard\nclueless guy.\nLet me clear this up once and for\nall, she likes you, she really really\nlikes you! No she doesn\u2019t have a\nsquint; she just doesn\u2019t seem to be\nabel to tear her eyes away from you.\nYour friends are either winding you\nup or are as hopelessly confused\nand clueless as you are. If you don\u2019t\nlike her, I\u2019d think about investing in\na pair of thick shoes as I can\u2019t see\nthe book dropping ending anytime\nsoon. If you do like her, there is no\nway asking her out will backfire,\nand please do it soon and save her\nbefore she hurts herself!!\nDear miss confidentiality,\nMy friend is in a long distance\nrelationship, and he talks to his\ngirlfriend on the phone a lot. Last\ntime he spoke to her, she said she\nwas on the toilet, he said it freaked\nhim out, is this natural?\nPee-ed off\nDear Pee-ed off,\nUmm, not exactly sure what you\u2019re\nasking. Well please tell \u2018your friend\u2019\nthat people, no matter how gorgeous they are, do occasionally\nneed to visit the bathroom and not\njust to have a shower. It is only\nnatural. I understand that he may\nhave been slightly grossed out but\nthe answer to that is simple; ask\nher to call you after she\u2019s finished\nher business, be it number one or\nnumber two. I can understand how,\nto you, your girlfriend is the most\nperfect thing in the world. I\u2019m sure\nyou do love her but, unfortunately\nyou do have to come to terms with\nthe fact that she is human. Unless\nshe is a robot in which case why is\nshe in the bathroom she may short-circuit!\nDear Miss Con\ufb01dentiality...\nHi kids, I\u2019m here to help you with\nall the worries you might have\nabout life at uni and beyond.\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to email me,\nagony.felix@imperial.ac.uk.

    "content": "Gunther Von Hagens the plastination professor, he shot back\n\u201cdo you regard him as a scientist?\u201d Winston himself has his\nreservations: he regards him more as a \u201ctravelling showman\n\u2013 quite a good travelling showman\u201d. Prof Winston questions\nwhether people really \u201cwatch him because they want to learn\nabout anatomy\u201d and wonders \u201cif they learn anything about\nhow their bodies work\u201d.\nLord Winston regards it as \u201chugely voyeuristic\u201d, but wonders\n\u201cwhat makes him tick: his facial expressions are bizarre and\nhe wears a hat while he\u2019s doing dissections.\u201d\nWhile other scientists regard Von Hagens\u2019 work as morally reprehensible, Winston is not quite so damning. However,\nalthough he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to do it, I expect I would do a better job if I did\u201d. He believes there is a place for anatomy on TV\nand cites Jonathan Miller\u2019s A Body in Question dissection as\n\u201cpowerful, non-voyeuristic, highly engaging TV\u201d.\n\u201cWomen can\u2019t have it all\u201d \u2013 British Medical Journal\nA recent report in the BMJ stated that women should not\nwait until their late thirties to have children. It said that the\navailability of IVF may encourage women to postpone preg-nancy.\nWinston thought that the \u201cauthors were trying to have it both\nways. I thought the authors were a bit poorly focussed. They\nwere trying to say they weren\u2019t preaching, but they were telling\npeople to have babies earlier. I don\u2019t think that is an acceptable\napproach: we need to be much more subtle.\nI don\u2019t think you can tell women when they\u2019re in their late\nthirties that they need to have a baby now as they might regret\nit later. It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s not actually how life works. I feel our\ncolleagues at another university south of the river are peddling\nrather simplistic arguments.\nTeaching at Imperial\nWinston bemoans the fact that he rarely has the opportunity to teach undergraduate students: \u201cthey [Imperial College]\ndon\u2019t wheel me out to teach undergraduates, and I\u2019d like to,\nreally. I give the odd talk, but don\u2019t do a lot of undergraduate\nteaching.\u201d\nHe does regularly tour schools and universities, and finds it\n\u201cfunny that when I go to other universities around the country\nI talk to absolutely full lecture theatres. I get bigger audiences in places like Exeter, Warwick or Aberdeen than I do\nat Imperial in London. I suppose when you\u2019re at home people\nR\nOBERT WINSTON has revolutionised the way\nscience is portrayed on television. No longer\nis science restricted to Channel 4 Learning or\nlate night BBC2: his recent collaboration with\nCasualty attracted 7.3 million viewers at prime\ntime on BBC1.\nJust one of the many highly complimentary comments on the\nshow\u2019s website said: \u201cI was expecting this to be a quite tedious\nepisode, but the fluidity of his performance and interactivity\nwas quite impressive to say the least.\u201d\nProfessor Winston has produced numerous highly successful TV series, including The Human Body, The Secret Life\nof Twins, Superhuman and Child of Our Time. His cheerful\ndemeanour and trademark moustache are now well recognised across Britain. But he says his success is due to luck, at\nleast in part: \u201cI feel very privileged. The biggest thing I\u2019ve had\nin my career is luck; I\u2019ve been in the right places at the right\ntimes and I\u2019ve had the right people to help.\u201d His \u2018big break\u2019\noccurred through a bit of a \u2018Judy Finnigan at the BAFTAs\u2019\nepisode: \u201cMy trousers fell down while I was doing a televised\ncesarean section; I\u2019ve been hooked with TV ever since.\u201d\nWinston is one of a select number of scientists that have\nsucceeded in conveying complex scientific ideas to the public\nin an engaging manner. But he does not agree with the \u201cgrumbling within the scientific community\u201d over the lack of quality\ncoverage of science issues in the media. In fact, he used his\nrecent presidential address to the British Association for the\nAdvancement of Science to \u201cargue that we actually have a\npretty good, fairly scientifically-literate press.\u201d He continues\n\u201cwe have some of the best science journalists in the world\u201d.\nHe agrees with the view that the media does to some extent\nheighten public mistrust of technology. But he also believes\nthat \u201cwe should be more aware that there is actually a very\ngood reason that people should mistrust technology: it is quite\nthreatening. What we haven\u2019t recognised as scientists is that\nmistrust is a natural aspect of our society.\u201d\nSurprisingly, given that most scientists yearn for more and\nmore science on TV, Winston believes that in fact \u201cwe don\u2019t\ndo too badly, we probably do proportionately better than other\ncountries. And the quality isn\u2019t bad either.\u201d\nHe has found it \u201cmore difficult to work with the Discovery\nChannel recently, as they are looking more and more to dumb-down the science we want to produce. We want to be much\nmore challenging with the science. They don\u2019t want to challenge their audience.\u201d\nHe complains that audiences in America, where he \u201cmight\nget one or two million\u201d viewers, are much smaller proportionately compared to the UK where he \u201cgenerally gets more than\n5m viewers\u201d.\nRadical Scientists\nWhen I asked him his view of radical scientists, such as\nImperial\u2019s own TV star talks to Felix about why he wants to get more\ninvolved with undergraduate teaching, the role of the media in\nscience and how his trousers falling down launched his TV career.\nProf. Lord Robert Winston\n\u201cMy trousers fell down while I\nwas I doing a televised\nCaesarean section\u201d\n3\nfelix\nThursday 6 October 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nreckon they can see you all the time.\u201d\nHe is very keen to take up a new chair in science and society\nat Imperial. \u201cIn my view one of the problems with this modern science university is that it doesn\u2019t teach communication\nenough. I don\u2019t think it teaches a whole lot of things I think we\nshould be teaching \u2013 the nature of science, ethics, and risk.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to see the university doing much more in [terms\nof] having ethics inbuilt into undergrad teaching...communica-tion is an essential role for the scientist today.\u201d\n\u201cThe irony of Imperial is that it\u2019s got some really good courses\nin science and the media, but they\u2019re mostly postgraduate not\nundergraduate. I think there\u2019s a need for more undergraduate\ninvolvement. Course organisers will always say that it means\nextending the course or that they can\u2019t teach the curriculum.\nI would argue that communication is too vital a part of being a\nscientist today for it to be ignored. The implications for society\nand the risks and advantages of commercial development \u2013 it\u2019s\nall very important.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to introduce, but it gives you more wisdom\nabout the science. It gives you the notion of the university\nbeing responsible for thinking about the role of science in soci-ety. The science we do doesn\u2019t belong to us; it\u2019s all funded\nthrough the public, so the public own the science. People are\nreluctant to accept that but it\u2019s true.\u201d\nWinston has \u201cmissed not having more contact with the\nundergraduate body. Undergrads are in many ways much\nmore interesting.\u201d So it appears that if Prof. Winston has his\nway Imperial undergrads may be lucky enough to have him as\na lecturer.\nWhile talking about the rumours that Imperial may stop\nteaching undergraduates he said: \u201cit would be a terribly negative step...I think it would be a very impoverished university\nwithout them. You could argue that it would no longer be a\nuniversity, more a research institute.\u201d But he does not believe\nthe rumours are true.\nWhat next for Lord Winston?\nAlthough Prof. Winston has just officially announced his\nretirement he is currently conducting research into transgenic\npigs. The goal of the work, which involves modifying pig genes\nusing novel methods, is to eventually produce organs that\nmight be used in human transplantation.\nHe has a new book and television series coming out soon\ncalled The Story of God. He believes that God and science can\ncoexist, as explained in his book.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a place for a story of creation. Evolution is as close\nto being proved as we can have it. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily\nnullify the biblical account of things.\u201d\nRupert Neate\nThe Story of God is published 17 October\nThe TV series begins in December on the BBC\n\n"
