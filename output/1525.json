If your items\nare stolen there is a much higher\nchance of getting them back if the\npolice can trace them to you.

Students and sta\ufb00 leave their property\nunattended because they feel it is a\nsafe place to do so. Leaving your laptop and phone in an unlocked o\ufb03ce is\nlike leaving it in Hyde Park or in a caf\u00e9.\nTA: When on nights out, what\nshould everyone do to ensure nobody is harmed?\nNL: Always plan your journey home,\nfew people do this and can end up a\nbit worse for drink and wandering\naround. If the night changes, re-assess\nyour journey home. Try to stay with at\nleast one other person and if you are\ntravelling by bus, stay on the ground\n\ufb02oor \u2013 don\u2019t go upstairs.\nIf someone o\ufb00ers you a \u201cCab\u201d or\n\u201cTaxi\u201d, they are an illegal taxi tout.\nNEVER USE THE SERVICES OF\nAN ILLEGAL TAXI TOUT, you are\njust getting in to a stranger\u2019s car, they\ncan charge you what they like, would\nnot have insurance to carry you, and\ncould attack you.\nTA: Living out is the \ufb01rst di\ufb00erence between \ufb01rst and second year.\nWhat should people avoid doing?\nNL: Plan your journeys, ensure you\npick up your post as soon as you can\nif it is left in a common area such as\nthe hallway. Keep your room or apartment locked and never let a stranger\nin through the front door of the prop-erty. Don\u2019t carry large sums of cash\naround, keep it in the bank.\nTA: Landlord problems are not too\nuncommon. What should people do\nto make sure they aren\u2019t taken to\ncourt and have a strong case if ever\nin trouble?\nNL: The Landlords and Tenants Act\nis very precise about the way a tenant and a landlord should conduct\nbusiness and behave. When you take\na property be sure to get a Shorthold\nTenancy Agreement from your land-lord. This will normally be for a period of 6 or 12 months.

It\u2019s currently 3am on Wednesday, and I\u2019m looking down the barrel of\na very real possibility of an all nighter.\nSomething nobody ever tells you (but\nI\u2019m doing it right now as I feel like\nmoaning) is just how tiring making\nthis newspaper can be... but, honestly,\nit\u2019s still fun. I wouldn\u2019t swap jobs with\nanyone (even if the job is underwear\nmodel fondeller \u2013 not that that job ex-ists; probably bureaucrats ruining the\nfucking world again with their red tape\nand systems and stuff).\nAnyway, now is the crucial time\nto decide. All those of you not lucky\nenough to be a fresher will know\nthis question: do I just persevere and\ncontinue the all nighter, or do I go to\nbed and get some (brief) sleep. It all\ncomes down to this: what will make\nme the most awake tomorrow morn-ing? You may think that this is just\nself indulgent ramblings of a massive\ntool, because that is precisely what it\nis. However, it is relevant to students.\nI\u2019m essentially doing research for you:\nI\u2019m field testing to see which method\nis the best and most productive, and\ncome revision period you\u2019ll be thanking me.\nNokia nightmare\nNow onto tackling the big issue of the\nday. The new generation of smartphones have been released and I\ncan\u2019t resist giving a quick note on it.\nNokia have been shouting to anyone\nwho will listen (at Imperial, that\u2019s a\ndecent amount) that they have \u201cwireless charging\u201d. This sounds incredible,\nbut it\u2019s not exactly as it seems. I\u2019m not\nsaying they are misleading you all on\npurpose, I\u2019m saying they are very good\nat marketing themselves.\nThe way this wireless charging\nworks is that you plug a cushion thing\ninto the wall and the phone just sits\non it. So, yeah, it is charging wirelessly\nin terms of the phone isn\u2019t plugged\nin, but there\u2019s still a wire intimately\ninvolved in the charging process.\nThey\u2019ve just shifted it from being\nstraight into the phone to being into a\nmiddle man. It\u2019s not like you can wander around a room and charge your\nphone. That\u2019s unfair actually, you can,\nit\u2019s just you\u2019d be phoneless, just like\nevery other phone.\nPerhaps you think this is unimportant (you\u2019d be right) but there is\na link to a wider issue here. Perhaps\nnow you\u2019re thinking I\u2019m about to put\nin some tenuous social commentary\nor observation (you\u2019d be right AGAIN,\nyou\u2019re really on fire, good job you). The\npoint is that not everything is always\nhow it immediately sounds, seems,\nand is told to us. Don\u2019t let anybody\nsway you with what they want you to\nthink and feel (erm, except for this text\nhere). Question marketing, question\neverything.\nTrusting them?\nYou\u2019ll notice two stories regarding the\nImperial College Healthcare Trust in\nthis issue.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that a lot of people\naren\u2019t fans of the proposals. There are\nthree proposals on the table, and soon\nwe will find out the exact outcome. My\npersonal thoughts are that it would\nseem that it is difficult to get a straight\nanswer out of anyone. It\u2019s hard to find\nout exactly what is going on, and how\nthe plans will affect the students at Imperial.\nIn a perfect world, none of the hospitals will be reduced. We don\u2019t live in that\nworld, but it would just be appreciated\nby everyone if some honesty, rather\nthan a waffling non-answer, were to be\ngiven to questions. I guess we\u2019ll all have\nto wait and see what happens.\nCOMMENT LONDON TECH\nEffects of alcohol Discover London Smartphones?\nAlways a lively debate in Comment. Three whole\npages of people giving their opinions on all of the\nimportant matters. There\u2019s a thought about Boris\nJohnson, some discussion of that sporting thing\nover summer.

Everyone\nsays that they\u2019ll in some way explore all of the generic tourist sites in this fair capital, but they usually\nnever get round to it.

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe summer of 2012 has been a stunning exhibition of top quality sports,\nas world-class athletes congregated in\nLondon for an unforgettable Olympics\nand arguably the best ever Paralympics.\nAn intriguing Euro 2012 was showcased\nearlier in the summer in Eastern Europe,\nand this trio of gargantuan sporting festivals were bookended by the Wimbledon and US Open Grand Slams. Many\nwould think that this is set to continue\ninto September with the T20 World Cup\nheld in Sri Lanka, but in reality the Tamils that inhabit the Northern and Eastern parts of the country and the Tamil\ndiaspora have plenty of reason to think\notherwise.\nQuestions are once again being raised\nas to why the International Cricket\nCouncil has permitted Sri Lanka not\nonly to participate but also to host one\nof the sport\u2019s most prestigious tourna-ments, especially with the on-going allegations of human rights abuses and war\ncrimes against the Tamils of Sri Lanka.\nThis essential role bestowed upon Sri\nLanka legitimises and condones a country that is in dire circumstances.\nThe Government and many distinguished individuals argue that this can\nhelp towards the reconciliation between\nthedisplacedTamilsofSriLankaandthe\nmajority Sinhalese population. When\nexplored further, however, the idea that\nsport can heal the growing rift between\nthe two races simply seems nonsensical.\nSport is far too trivial to gloss over the\ndeaths of tens of thousands of civilians\nand to overcome the racial discrimination that Tamils have been and still are\nsubjected to.\nThe argument is that sport, and its\nassociated celebrations, could be used\nas a tool to heal the rifts between different parts of society and induce a\nsense of camaraderie and team spirit.\nHowever with the continued failure of\nthe Sri Lankan Government\u2019s Lessons\nLearnt and Reconciliation Commission\n(LLRC) to provide accountability for\nthe 40,000 lives lost in the \ufb01nal days of\nthe civil war (as mentioned in the UN\nPanel of Experts report), is it justi\ufb01ed\nfor this country to host such a sporting\nevent? By failing to revoke out-of-date\nemergency laws and preventing media\norganisations from entering the northern and eastern parts of the country,\nthe Government has embarked upon\ngreater militarisation and colonisation\nof these areas. Consequently humanitarian organisations have reported ongoing\nhuman rights abuses which can only\nundo and devastate the supposed healing e\ufb00ects that the T20 World Cup can\nprovide.\nUndoubtedly, senior government\npoliticians see this as a way to mask\nthe crimes committed by the Government, rather than something heading in\nthe direction of reconciliation, derived\nCricket: a tool for reconciliation?\nPraveen\nGnanasambanthan\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\n20\nWhy sport and politics cannot be separated\nfrom accountability. On Sri Lanka\u2019s \u2018new\nbrand\u2019 Nivard Cabraal, the central bank\nGovernor, stated: \u201cI am con\ufb01dent that\nthis trend will continue in the future\nand those so-called international calls\nfor [war crimes] investigation will fade\naway.\u201d\nMindsets such as these further prove\nthattheSriLankanGovernmentareloth\nto make a genuine attempt to investigate\nand bring justice to the victims of the\nwar. This unwillingness further demonstrates the insincerity and casual nature\nof the Government towards the resolution passed by the humans rights coun-cil, asking for the Government\u2019s own\nrecommendations on the situation, and\na timeframe in which they can be carried out. One should enquire whether\nthe T20 World Cup will be utilised as\na way to unite a fragmented country or\nmerely as an exercise in distracting the\ninternational community from the grave\nproblems the country faces.\nAs stated by Charu Lata Hogg, the Sri\nLankaexpertattheLondonbasedthinktank Chatham House: \u201cHosting an international sporting event will not de\ufb02ect\ninternational attention on its core human rights responsibilities.\u201d\nBeyond this, applying the view that\nsports and politics have nothing to do\nwith one another is simply indi\ufb00erent\nand very dismissive. This could not be\nfurther from the truth. As Archbishop\nDesmond Tutu has said: \u201cIt is a myth to\nsay that sports and politics do not mix.\u201d\nThe Sri Lankan cricket board is intertwined with the Government to its very\ncore, to the point that the members of\nthe cricket boards are selected by means\nof political pressure and direct intervention from the government. Many\nquestionable selections have been made\nby the cricket board; as recently as last\nyear, Sanath Jayasuriya was called up to\nthe national team. There has been much\ndebate about whether this was down to\nhis political standing or his now declining sporting ability. With all these allegations of Government controlled selections of the national team being made,\nwe can break down the idea that the Sri\nLankan state and cricket within Sri Lanka are unconnected.\nMoreover the same army that has\nbeen accused of the heinous war crimes\nin Sri Lanka is responsible for the maintenance and the running of the three\nlargest cricket stadiums. The links between what should be an amazing festival of cricket and the ongoing human\nrights abuses occurring within the country are clear, and calls for a cricketing\nboycott of Sri Lanka should be voiced,\nuntil genuine and signi\ufb01cant attempts\nare made by the Sri Lankan government\nto follow the resolution and bring about\nreconciliation through justice. Through\nthis many avid cricket fans can enjoy a\nless politically in\ufb02uenced world cup.\nCalls for the exclusion of Sri Lanka\nfrom cricket should not be seen as too\nrobust or excessive; in fact, sport has\nbeen helpful in bringing about changes\nto countries with dire situations, most\nnotably South Africa. In that case, the\nUnited Nations created a \u201cRegister of\nSports Contacts with South Africa\u201d\nwhich put the spotlight on sporting stars\nthat were unwilling to stay away from\nApartheid South Africa. Many international sporting bodies banned South\nAfrica from participating until it \ufb01nally\ngave way to the end of Apartheid.\nMore recently, Desmond Tutu, a \ufb01gure key to this South African boycott,\nonce again called out for English cricketers to avoid competing with Zimbabwe\nuntil a political change was brought\nabout and Robert Mugabe was taken out\nofpower:\u201cIbelievethatasigni\ufb01cantpart\nof the population in Zimbabwe would\nsay [the cricketers] should not be here,\nbecause you are lending a legitimacy\nand respectability to a country that is in\na shambles because of one person.\u201d\nMany parallels can be drawn between\nZimbabwe and Sri Lanka where the T20\nWorld Cup is \u201clending a legitimacy and\nrespectability to a country that is in a\nshambles.\u201d\nSports fans and cricket fans across the\nglobe have every right to question what\ninitially appeared to be unnecessary calls\nfor exclusion or boycott of the World\nCup. However there are evident links\nbetween the Sri Lankan cricket board\nand a government that has engaged in\nnumerous war crimes. The T20 World\nCup might have started but the time to\ntake a stand against Sri Lanka is never\ntoo late. One can only hope that the\ngovernments and cricket boards of the\nparticipating countries will realise that\nhumanitarian issues should take precedence over sporting ones.\nThe Sri Lankan cricket\nboard is intertwined with\nthe Government to its\nvery core\nGo e\no\nnt to its\nnt to its\ny core\ncore\nThe Sri Lan\nThe Sri L\nkan cricke\nkan cricke\nb d\nCaption in here please!

    "content": "I procrastinate by reading this book. Technically time well spent?\nBUSINESS\nBusiness Editor: Deepka Rana\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\nHow to stop wasting time\nDeepka Rana spends 3 hours pretending to write a byline\nhis week I met Dr. Magdalena Bak-Maier, a\npersonal development\nand learning expert,\nexecutive coach to top\nlevel scientists and entrepreneurs, and\nauthor of Get Productive. The premise\nof the book is simple: instead of feeling overwhelmed by having too much\nto do, you can learn how to use your\nbrain well and get things done with\ntime to spare. As she currently works\nat Imperial as a Organisational Developement Consultant, it seemed \ufb01tting\nto ask the productivity expert a few\nquestions to help Imperial students\nwith their studying habits:\nDR: Do you believe electronic\napps/tools aid productivity (such as\nEverNote, Dropbox etc.) and why?\nMBM: Some do and many don\u2019t. A\ngood app helps you get things done\nand saves you time. My favorites are:\nSkype for one-to-one interviews and\nface-to-face project work anytime,\nDropbox to carry and access key\ndocuments, Goalscape for mapping\nand tracking your goals, and Notes for\nwriting simple to-do lists and remind-ers. I also really love Clock and use it\nto work to time on tasks. It\u2019s amazing\nwhat the brain can do when you give it\na challenge.\nDR: What is the most common\nproblem people have when it come\nto productivity and how do you advise them?\nMBM: The key problem is procras-tination, as in delaying the work for\nlater. In the brain, procrastination is\nactually a code for \u2018get more info,\u2019 but\nfew people have worked that out. So\ninstead, procrastination is used to ill\ne\ufb00ect. My advice is to learn how your\nbrain works and what processes run\ne\ufb03ciently in there and how come and\nthen to replicate that process. This is\nwhat I do with people in my one-to-one work: Look at things where you\ndon\u2019t procrastinate and notice why.\nThen compare to areas where you do\nand get curious. For intelligent brains\nthe answers appear pretty quick. It\u2019s\nlike engineering. There\u2019s a problem\nand there\u2019s at least one creative way to\nsolve it. In my book I identi\ufb01ed 13 so-lutions, and all problems can be solved\nusing a combination of these strate-gies, if not one strategy.\nDR: Is there such a thing as being\ntoo productive? Where should peo-ple, students in particular, strike a\nbalance?\nMBM: In the traditional sense of\nproductivity as in getting results, yes!\nBut I have rede\ufb01ned productivity on\nfar more holistic terms. To be productive means to achieve results like maybe top grades but also beinghealthy,\nbalanced, having fruitful relationships\nwith others, and keeping it all in per-spective. Productivity of this nature\nleads to long term stability and sustained performance and will give you\na competitive edge in the job market.\nDR: How can students better hone\ntheir leadership and time management skills on a day-to-day basis?\nMBM: Use the 13 strategies I outline\nin the book on a daily basis and hone\nthem like any other skill. Most likely,\nyou will \ufb01nd that you\u2019re already good\nat some of them, some of the time. So\ngive yourself an extra edge by working that up in a way that matches your\nneeds and life. This is what makes Get\nProductive so unique. Rather than being prescriptive, it is creative. It lets\nyou work the solutions however you\nwant so long as you focus on results.\nDR: What is the most interesting\ncase you have come across in your\nfield as an author/consultant?\nMBM: I once worked with an academic who arrived to my o\ufb03ce feeling overwhelmed and frazzled. We\nworked together for 3 months and in\nthe end he found so much free time\nhe came back so that we could brainstorm how he could use it! I regularly\nwork with leaders challenging them\nto aim higher and do better but to\nachieve this on healthy, fun terms.\nAnd I model that in my own life. It\u2019s\nmore fun that way.\nYou can get a free copy of a sample\nchapter from Get Productive at the\nfollowing website:\nhttp://www.maketimecount.com/\nsample-chapter/\nDr. Magdalena Bak-Maier posseses\nover 10 years experience in the \ufb01eld\nof consulting and developing people,\nand a background in neuroscience.\nMagdalena works with scientists, art-ists, business executives and entre-preneurs, including G8 summit and\nWorld Economic Forum speakers,\nand uses her knowledge and insights\nto help individuals \ufb01re on all four cyl-inders.

Day 1 set\nthe tone by starting with the very innocently named \u20184x4s\u2019. This in fact\nturned out to be 4 minutes of pain followed by 4 minutes of laughing at your\npartner in pain repeated 4 times\u2026 not\nas fun as it sounds! It was all worth it\nin the end, however, and the feeling\ndid eventually return to our legs. At\nleast none of our group were sick during this ordeal, unlike some (*cough*\nAmerican Football *cough*). After the\npain had worn o\ufb00, and after a long\nlunch break it became apparent that a\nlot of thought had gone into designing\nsessions speci\ufb01c for each sport and\nthis wasn\u2019t just intended to be a painful reminder of how little exercise we\nhad done over the last few months.\nAfter lunch we paid our \ufb01rst visit\nto the new Ethos Performance Gym,\nwhich will be available for use by certain clubs this year. Now I have to say\nthat as a rather small girl I have never\nbeen brave enough to use the weights\nsection in the main Ethos gym, so this\nwas a completely new experience. We\nwere taken slowly through the various lifting techniques by the strength\nand conditioning coaches (Chris, the\ncoach for the hockey and football\ngroup, was a particularly good teacher and had only 3% body fat (!) which\ngave us all something to aspire to!),\nand then given a tough strength circuit incorporating the newly learned\nlifts to \ufb01nish.\nThis was the general format of the\n\ufb01rst week, with morning and afternoon sessions every day targeted at\nimproving our general and sport-speci\ufb01c \ufb01tness. Our only relief came during the Thursday afternoon recovery\nsession in the Ethos pool, sauna and\n\u2018ice bath\u2019 (or more accurately, paddling pool with cold water).\nIn week 2 we put all our weight\ntraining and \ufb01tness into action with\nsessions targeting sport-speci\ufb01c techniques such as top speed and speed\nendurance training. Our group added\na fun twist to the week with a \u2018Dickof-the-Day\u2019 shirt kindly provided by\nour trainer Chris. The winners are\nfeatured in the pictures for everyone\u2019s\nentertainment.\nIn the gym we learnt Olympic lifts\n(that is the lifts you see in the Olympics), apparently in the Olympics a\n50kg girl could lift twice her body-weight; I was left feeling a little inadequate by only managing 20kg!\nHowever, as with all of the session,\nthis training was designed to improve\na speci\ufb01c aspect of our sport-speci\ufb01c\nstrength, in this case by developing our explosive power to help us\nbe quicker o\ufb00 the mark and faster at\nchanging direction.\nAgility and power training was then\napplied to a \u2018game situation\u2019 as voted\nby us (we played dodgeball), and we\nare assured that there are plans to include this more often in the schedule\nfor next year.\nIn addition to training, free physio\nand sport massages were available\nthroughout the two weeks was provide to aid our aching muscles and the\nmany small injuries we all acquired\nduring the 2 weeks.\nAll in all it was an extremely bene\ufb01cial 2 weeks, and all who attended felt\n\ufb01tter and stronger by the end. There\nare hundreds of photos on the Sport\nImperial facebook page so have a look\nat them to get an idea of the fun we\nhad, and I hope next year more people\nwill come and take advantage of the\ngreat opportunity Sport Imperial laid\non for us.\nSorcha Cotter Sports Editor\nJust before Christmas I decided to\ntake up a \u201cchallenge\u201d to raise money\nfor the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. My little\ncousin, who su\ufb00ers from the disease,\nhad been going through a rough patch.\nI wanted to do something that would\nattract sponsorship, so I plumped for\nIronman Wales. What I did know was\nthat this was a 2.4 mile swim followed\nby a 112 mile cycle followed by a 26.2\nmile run, all to be completed within\n17 hours. What I didn\u2019t know was that\nthe course, which takes place in and\naround Tenby, is widely regarded to be\none of the toughest out there. It turns\nout that Pembrokeshire is a pretty\nhilly place not particularly well known\nfor its clement weather \u2013 who\u2019d have\nthought, eh? The bike section alone\nwould have 2400 vertical meters.\nSo I set about turning myself from\na climber into a long course triathlete.\nFrom Christmas until September I\nbarely laid hands on a pint (apart from\na few \u201cnotable\u201d exceptions, ahem)\nand I\u2019d be swimming, cycling or running for anywhere between 8 and 20\nhours a week. Not only did this knock\n8kg o\ufb00 my body weight (1 1/4 stone\nfor the dinosaurs), but it also turned\nme into a grumpy, tired bastard. For\nanyone who came into contact with\nme during the last six months, sorry\nabout that. I came to \ufb01nd swimming\ninterminably dull, cycling quite fun\n(although getting up every Saturday\nat 6am to ride for 7 hours less so) and\nrunning pretty mundane. As much as\nI enjoy living in London, it doesn\u2019t really lend itself to long distance endurance sports. Cycling only gets pleasant\nonce you\u2019ve been going for an hour or\nso and you\u2019re outside the M25, and\nthere are only so many times you can\nrun around the Royal Parks before\nthe desire to throw tourists into the\nSerpentine becomes overwhelming.\nLiving somewhere like the middle of\nDartmoor would make training somewhat more enthralling than yet another trip up the Grand Union Canal\nto Sudbury.\nAs well as being a drain on time and\nenergy, triathlon sucks up a ludicrous\namount of cash. Once you get caught\nup in the bike world, it shackles you\ndown while it picks up your bank account and shakes it until there\u2019s nothing left. I found myself checking for\n\u201cdeals\u201d on a daily (OK, hourly) basis\nand I\u2019ve lost count of the number of\ntimes I\u2019ve hauled myself back from the\nverge of spending hundreds of pounds\non a single wheel because it might\nmake things slightly easier on the day\n(\u201cbut it\u2019s so shiny and aerodynamic\u2026\nit saves you at least 0.034 milliwatts\ncompared to what I\u2019ve got at the moment etc etc\u201d). My \ufb01ctional accountant is going to be delighted that this\nis all over.\nThe event week rolled around in the\nblink of an eye. After all the hours I\u2019d\nput in I found myself considerably \ufb01tter than when I\u2019d started (duh) and\nthankfully injury free. It also turned\nme into a hypochondriac of the highest order. If I thought I heard someone\nsni\ufb04e on the other side of the room I\u2019d\nbe out of there quicker than a neutrino detected by a machine with loose\nwiring (sorry \u2013 you can take the geek\nout of Imperial, but...) I can totally understand Bradley Wiggins not wanting to shake hands with his admirers\nin the build up to a big competition.\nHis stakes are ever so slightly higher\nthan mine, after all. Event week also\ngave me a problem I\u2019d never had before \u2013 trouble with sleeping. It\u2019s a bizarre situation to \ufb01nd oneself in when,\nhaving previously considered oneself\na master of the powernap, adrenaline\nspikes hit your bloodstream just regularly enough to stop you getting the\nrequisite z\u2019s.\nThe night before the big day I didn\u2019t\nsleep at all. You read all sorts of things\nabout training and mental preparation\nduring the build-up, and they all say\nthings like \u201cfocus on what you can do\nsomething about, don\u2019t worry about the\nrest\u201d. This is crazy advice because it\u2019s\ncompletely impossible to follow. Unless\nyou have the mental training of an SAS\nDelta-Force MI6 super-commando,\nof course you\u2019ll spend the entire time\nfretting about the weather, mechanical\nfailures, crashing, drowning, failing etc\netc. On top of this, triathlon is a sport\nfor people with OCD. Everything has\nto be prepared \u201cjust so\u201d to make your\ntransitions from one sport to the next\nas smooth and quick as possible. Given\nthat this was my \ufb01rst triathlon, I had\nexactly no experience to draw upon\nand I\u2019d worry about not having put my\ntrainers in the right bag. I\u2019m not exactly\nknown for my ability to micro-manage\nthe little details.\nYou can sponsor Ned online by\nvisiting www.justgiving.com/Ned-sIronman or by text through JustTextGiving by sending \u2018IRON66\n\u00a3(amount you\u2019d like to give)\u2019 to\n70070.\nPart 2 will be next week.\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nSorcha Cotter, Margot Pikovsky\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNed Prepares for Winter by Becoming an Ironman\nThat BDSM session\nbarely left a welt.\nMust try harder.\nNed Yoxall Sports Writer\nNice rims.\n\n"

The Imperial Fringe, however, has a slightly\ndi\ufb00erent remit, looking at speci\ufb01c\nscienti\ufb01c topics inspired by research\ncurrently being undertaken by Imperial researchers.\nFringe events appear to be monthly,\nwith events for both this and next\nmonth announced, though dates\nfor future talks up to and including\nMarch have also been given.\nTopics for the events currently\ninclude the study of how the brain\nworks and fear, as well as another on\nbones and the latest \u2018groundbreaking\u2019\nresearch currently being undertaken\nby Imperial researchers in this area.\nAttendance is free and is open to\nstudents, sta\ufb00, and the general pub-lic, and no registration is necessary. A\npay bar is open all evening.\nMore information can be found on\nthe Imperial website, at http://www3.\nimperial.ac.uk/festival/fringe.\nPhilip Kent Science Editor\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\nSolar cells get a boost\nScientists at the University of California Santa Barbara have developed\nan improved method of generating\nsolar electricity. Rather than making\nuse of the photoelectric e\ufb00ect, this\nnewly designed solar cell generates\nelectricity while splitting water into\noxygen and hydrogen gas. In the past,\nthe main di\ufb03culty in building such\ncells has been \ufb01nding a catalyst that\nisn\u2019t simply oxidised by the highly reactive molecular oxygen involved in\nthe process. Recent developments in\nthe \ufb01eld of cobalt-based catalysts have\nnow made them a more feasible alter-native.\nThe cell makes use of a phenomenon known as surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR), which is the resonant oscillation of valence electrons\nin a solid when it is hit by photons of\nthe electrons\u2019 natural frequency. The\nmain bene\ufb01t of SPR is that the energy\ncan be built up gradually, as each incident photon of a su\ufb03ciently similar\nfrequency contributes. This is not the\ncase in cells using the photoelectric\ne\ufb00ect, where only high-frequency\nphotons (in the UV range) have any\ne\ufb00ect \u2013 the energy of lower frequency photons is wasted. In SPR, the\namount of energy generated is simply\nproportional to the intensity of incident light.\nPlasmons are best excited by photons in the visible spectrum. This is\nanother advantage over photovoltaic\ncells, which can only use photons in\nthe UV spectrum; the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is an excellent absorber of UV\nlight, which is good news for our skin,\nbut inconvenient for any method of\ngenerating electricity which relies\non UV photons. Visible photons are\nmuch more abundant on the Earth\u2019s\nsurface. The fact that visible photons\nhave a lower frequency and thus less\nenergy to give would decrease the\nsystem\u2019s e\ufb03ciency, as three or four\nphotons are needed to release a single\nelectron, but this is more than made\nup for by the increased number of usable photons.\nUsually, the di\ufb03culty in using SPR\nto generate electricity is doing so\nwithout damping the oscillating motion to the point of uselessness. The\ndevice designed by the group of scientists solves this issue by using titanium oxide-capped gold electrodes.\nThese rods are only 90 nm in diam-eter; an array of them is then connected to the platinum counterelectrode\n(where hydrogen is evolved). The\nsmall size of the rods limits the extent\nof the plasmon\u2019s motion, re\ufb02ecting it\nback onto its own path, creating an interference pattern, which in turn generates a stronger electric \ufb01eld, causing\nthe electrons to pile up towards the\nends of the rods. The titanium oxide\nat each end acts as an electrical insu-lator, which seems counterintuitive\nat \ufb01rst, but turns out to be an excellent way of regulating the amount\nof energy released from the surface\nplasmon. Only electrons of very high\nenergy manage to tunnel through its\nstructure, and these are then used\nto generate current, while the bulk\nof electrons remain, and continue to\npower the SPR process.\nThe \u201choles\u201d left behind by these\nhigh-energy electrons act like positive\ncharges, being transferred through\nthe cobalt-based catalyst wrapped\naround the centre of the rods, and\nused to combine oxygen radicals into\noxygen gas, completing the reaction.\nOne aspect of the process is yet to\nbe explained by any involved parties.\nAfter being exposed to a light source,\nthe generated current density jumps\nto some high value, as expected.\nHowever, instead of plateauing very\nquickly, it then proceeds to slowly increase by another third of the original\nvalue. None of the physical processes\ninvolved should take more than a few\nseconds, and yet the current density\ncontinues to change for much longer\nthan this. Further investigation is thus\nnecessary to fully explain the phenomena involved.\nDOI: 10.1021/nl302796f\nAnnina Sartor Writer\nACS Publications\nPeak absorbance around natural\nlight increases efficiency\nTake a look at the stranger side of research at a new monthly event\nImperial College London\nUPCOMING EVENTS\nThursday 25 October 18:00 \u2013 21:00\nSouth Kensington Campus\nThe science behind our fears: From mad scientists to brain eating zombies, Halloween is steeped in the weird and wonderful world of science.

For those who fall into\nthe latter category, you may have already checked for Hangman (yes it\u2019s here to\nstay), realised there\u2019s a new section titled Coffee Break (still not sure what it is\u2026),\nchecked the centrefold (wehay, some girls this week) and wondered what on\nearth this pullout is all about.\nTo answer; we here at Felix have devised a monthly competition with prizes\nwhich everybody can get involved with. Our general assumption is that like us,\nmost Imperial students are rather apathetic and may have never left West London, that is besides the occasional visit some facility labelled Piccadilly (mental)\nInstitute. This we feel has got to change.\nEach month we will be printing out for you a handy map of London, alongside\na selection of themed questions, photograph opportunities and tasks. Your job\ntherefore is to form your teams, answer the questions and complete the tasks for\na chance of winning some substantial prizes (no book tokens we promise) as well\nas, of course, getting to know London a little better.\nFor the first issue we felt it relevant to start with the \u2018Top Tourist Attractions\u2019\nas most of us (despite good intentions) will never visit them all during our time\nat Imperial. However as the months progress and granted you all show some interest in this feature we will send you off to the best brunch spots to the more\nobscure sites such as Jack the Ripper\u2019s local pub.\nThe rules of the game are self explanatory and all must be abided by. Any questions can be directed to the Felix office in the West Basement of Beit Quad. And\nlast but not least, we hope you have fun and that over the coming months you\nenjoy the opportunity to experience and visit new and interesting spots.\nUNDERCOVER LONDON\nRules\n1. You will need to form yourselves into teams of 4 or 5 members. (email teams to\nFelix before submitting final answers).\n2. You do not have to visit the sites in any particular order.\n3. The clues require a mixture of written answers and photographs.\n4. All photographs must include most members of your team.\n5. Try and not be a tool when doing it, and keep everything legal \u2013 or we get in\ntrouble .\n6. The cut off for submissions will be Midnight on Sunday 28th October. You will\nneed to have emailed in your answers and photographs to Felix before this time\nto be in with a chance of winning.\n7. Verbal submissions will not be accepted. No single item may be submitted\ntwice.\n8. The team with the highest number of points will be declared the winners and\ncontacted by Felix. In the scenario of a tie, the teams will be placed into a hat\nand picked at random. The judges\u2019 decision is final, and no whining, arguing or\npleading will be entertained to alter this decision. Although it may be quite entertaining for us.\n9. If any problems, email Felix at felix@imperial.ac.uk.\n10. Every effort has been made to try and make the clues easy to understand and\nup to date, however things can and will go wrong. Bear in mind that if a question suddenly become unanswerable (e.g. an object has been taken off display),\nother teams won\u2019t be able to answer it either, so you will not be at an unfair\ndisadvantage.\n11. Play nicely, have fun and most importantly get to know your city just a little\nbetter.\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER 23\n\n"

But, meh, there are probably less interesting ways to die\u201d.\nOf course, we didn\u2019t turn back.\nAside from the fear of failure and personal embarrassment and the knowledge that people had donated tons of\nmoney and wouldn\u2019t be too impressed\nwith me bailing because my knees\nhurt a little, what really kept me going was the incredible support we had\nfrom so many people.\nThere were the cars that honked\nand cheered as they overtook. There\nwere the people who let Sioni and\nI into their homes (and ensured we\nwere suitably hungover in the morn-ing). There were the good guys at\nLejogstics in Inverness who \ufb01xed the\nskeleton after su\ufb00ering total spinal\ncollapse on day 2. Half my equipment,\nincluding the skeleton and the pannier bags were lent to me by Reuben\nGibbons. The tandem was a loan from\nCarole and Graham Davies. We had\nan article on CNET and in local media thanks to John-Paul Jones and the\npress team at Imperial. Sport Imperial\nlent me some pro \u2018Imperial Wheelers\u2019\nkit. Hell, we even had the original record holder Art Ho\ufb00man sending us\nvideos of support from the US. There\u2019s\na near never-ending list of people who\nhelped make the cycle happen. It felt\nlike some huge cycle convoy making its way down the country, rather\nthan just Sioni and I battling our way\nthrough the wind and the rain.\nWhen we arrived at Land\u2019s End\nthe feeling was incredible. I took my\nhands from the handlebars, lifted my\narms into the air, and soaked in the\nmoment (secretly praying I wouldn\u2019t\nwipe out metres from the \ufb01nish line).\nIn case the whole trip wasn\u2019t surreal\nenough, there was a coach-load of\nChinese tourists who all wanted photos with us. (As far as I\u2019m concerned,\nSioni and I are now national celebrities in China\u2026)\nIn the end, we cycled a total of\n1487.17 km (924 miles) and climbed\n15km vertically. It was incredible fun.\nThe UK is more beautiful than I had\never thought.\nBut anyway, that\u2019s all over now. My\nknees still ache quite a bit, but I think\nthat\u2019s to do with the fact that I haven\u2019t\ndone a moment of exercise since getting o\ufb00 the tandem for the last time.\nI\u2019m now a world record holder. It took\n25 years for someone to break Art\nHo\ufb00man\u2019s record; hopefully it\u2019ll be\nmuch sooner before someone breaks\nmine.

    "content": "\u201cKeep the Cat Free\u201d\nIssue 1525 felixonline.co.uk\n05/10/12\nAs the ICURFC 1st XV arrived for\ntheir \ufb01rst match of tour against Harvard it was clear that things in America were going to be a bit di\ufb00erent. We\nwere \ufb01rst informed that we would be\nplaying on an arti\ufb01cial rubber crumb\npitch rather than grass, and then that\nthe Harvard team were only willing to\nplay 35 minute halves in the match.\nTo make matters worse, the pitch was\nmarked out with lines that were barely visible and the posts were declared\nunsafe by the referee minutes before\nkicko\ufb00 and moved behind the dead\nball line. Despite these setbacks, the\nteam was determined to put in a big\nperformance and a strong start from\nthe Imperial forwards saw a classic IC\nrolling maul go 22m for second row\nChris McGeough to crash over for his\n\ufb01rst try in over a year. Fly half James\nCox then slotted the conversion to\ntake the score to 7-0 on the 5 minute\nmark.\nFrom the resultant kicko\ufb00, captain\nJack Flanagan received the ball and\na strong carry saw him break 3 tackles before being brought to ground.\nGood work at the breakdown from\nthe IC forwards ensured quick ball\nfrom the ruck, and after some fast\nhands in the backline, outside centre\nCaolan Cotter recieved the ball and\nran 50m to score IC\u2019s second try. Just\nminutes later, a well placed kick to the\ncorner saw the IC forwards in perfect\nposition to execute another driving\nmaul, leading to McGeough\u2019s second\ntry of the day. Some squad members\nwere intrigued to notice that the \u2018best\nlineout jumper in the club\u2019 seemed\nto never call the ball to himself, and\ninstead made several calls that coincidentally involved McGeough receiving the ball at the back of the maul\nand scoring.\nOn the 20 minute mark, it was the\nturn of Imperial\u2019s deadly backline to\nget involved. More slick handling saw\nthe ball reach fullback Freddie White\nwho showed great pace to take the\nHarvard defenders on the outside and\nscore in the corner. James Cox was\nunsuccessful with the conversion as\na result of a gentle breeze across the\n\ufb01eld, leaving the score at 22-0 with\nonly 20 minutes played. After another\nstrong period of possession, quick\nruck ball and some great hands from\nforwards Chris McGeough and Sean\nBaker saw prop James Scaife burst\nthrough a gap in mid \ufb01eld to score.\nAnother successful conversion from\nCox saw the score at 29-0. From the\nkicko\ufb00, McGeough was again in the\nthick of the action but was injured in\na crunching midair collision. Despite\nhis injuries he played on in the hope\nof in\ufb02icting some payback.\nSome good play from the Harvard\nteam then saw them enter the Imperial 22 for the \ufb01rst time in the match\nafter half an hour of play, however IC\nmanaged to win a turnover to stamp\nout any hopes of Harvard scoring.\nAfter a scrappy period of play, a well\nexecuted move from the base of the\nscrum involving number 8 Sean Baker\nand scrum half Ed Durkin saw winger\nNathan Fitzpatrick score in the corner\nto make the score 34-0. Just minutes\nlater another strong carry from Baker\nfrom the base of the scrum and an\nexcellent o\ufb04oad in contact saw Cox\nscore under the posts and convert his\nown try to make the score 41-0.\nOn the 35 minute mark a nice move\ninvolving Caolan Cotter\u2019s \ufb01rst pass of\nthe game saw George Lane take the\nball and o\ufb04oad to winger Olisa Ufodiama to score and take the scoreline\nto 46-0 at half time. Despite the score-line Captain Jack Flanagan was keen\nto emphasise the need for improvement in several areas, and the team\ntook to the \ufb01eld determined to put in\na good second half performance.\nFrom the kicko\ufb00 another IC lin-eout and rolling maul saw second row\nMike O\u2019Connell score thanks to more\npinpoint accurate throwing from\nhooker Rob Kyle. Seeing that he was\nunlikely to complete a hatrick of tries\ndue to his earler injuriies, McGeough\nthen left the \ufb01eld to be replaced by\nfrenchman Pierre L\u2019Bour.\nIn the next few minutes the game\nbecame somewhat scrappier as IC\ntook their foot o\ufb00 the gas and began\nplaying without the structure and accuracy that saw them through their\nmost successful season ever. The only\naction of any note was a standard big\nhit from Sean Baker on an unsuspecting Harvard player and some more\nstrong defence by the entire IC team\n\u2013 with \ufb02ankers John Hardisty and\nJack Flanagan to the fore as usual.\nWith the Harvard players beginning\nto pile on the pressure, they were\nawarded a penalty in the IC 22 for\ninfringements at the breakdown, but\nwere unable to make anything come\nof their opportunity.\nAfter 50 minutes, the IC team \ufb01nally began to \ufb01nd some continuity,\nwith further scores from Cotter and\nFitzpatrick in quick succession taking the score to 63-0. With Cotter\u2019s\npass count now at a staggering total\nof 3, the backline were really beginning to come into their own and minutes later Fitzpatrick was put in the\ncorner again after some great interplay from the IC forwards and backs.\nMuch to the surprise of all watch-ing, prop Toby Spittle scored a try\n(via an outrageous dummy pass that\neven managed to fool some IC players including the usually astute Mike\nO\u2019Connell) and sealed a memorable\nwin with his second just minutes lat-er. Some bystanders went as far as to\nliken Spittle\u2019s brace of tries to seeing\nEmile Heskey scoring for England.\nWith the \ufb01nal score reading 73-0\nin a match that only lasted 70 min-utes, the Imperial team (controver-sially named \u2018the colonials\u2019 by several\nsquad members) was able to leave\nHarvard full of con\ufb01dence for the\nremainder of the tour and safe in the\nknowledge that their physicality, skill\nand passion for the game could not be\nmatched on the day.\nHarvard take a hammering\nSPORT\nSend your match reports in to sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nICURFC 73 \u2013 0Harvard\nSean Baker Sports Writer\nThat biscuit got soggy really quickly\nNice tiara Jon.\nAbly watched by his teammates, Olisa charges on.\n\n"

Write for TV\nDr Who\u2019s underwhelming love Song\nMaciej Matuszewski gives us his opinion on the newest Doctor\nhave previously expressed\nmy mixed views of Doctor\nWho on these pages. I\u2019ve\nbeen a regular viewer since\nthe show\u2019s revival in 2005 and\nhonestly I\u2019ve found over the years that\nthe show\u2019s episodes can be split into\nthree categories. A third are good and\nentertaining in their own right, a third\ndisappoint me at how they squander\nthe show\u2019s amazing premise, and\na third are so bad that they\u2019re fun\nto watch and laugh at.\nI\u2019m entertained two\nthirds of the time\nand so keep\nwatching\nbut under no circumstances could I say that\nthe show has been consistently good.\nI was therefore pleasantly surprised\nto \ufb01nd that I genuinely enjoyed all of\nthe \ufb01rst \ufb01ve episodes of the new se-ries. After much controversy about\nthe apparent overuse of long term story arcs, all of the episodes so far this\nseries have been standalone. I had,\nhonestly, been indi\ufb00erent about\nthe issue. While the long term\nDoctor Who storylines were\nhardly masterworks, I found\nsome of the worst ep-isodes, such as the abominable\n\u2018The Curse of the Black Spot\u2019, to be\nstandalones. The change in format,\nhowever, seems to have worked in\nthe show\u2019s favour.\nWhile there have been some missteps the episodes so far have all\nhad a wonderful feeling of freshness to them. Both the regulars\nand the guest stars have been on\n\ufb01ne form and the stories themselves have covered interesting, if\nnot entirely original, themes. There\nwas plenty to interest both the\nyounger viewers, such as the eponymous creatures from \u2018Dinosaurs\non a Spaceship\u2019, and the older, such\nas the discussion in \u2018A Town Called\nMercy\u2019 as to what sacri\ufb01ces should\nbe made in the name of justice.\nThe emotional departure of regular companions Rory and Amy was\nparticularly well done, being at the\nsame time tragic and unexpected\nas well as the culmination of a long\nrunning plot strand of the two\ngradually growing more distant\nfrom the Doctor.\nMy biggest complaint about the\nseries would have to be the use of, or\nrather lack of use of, River Song. Introduced years ago in \u2018Silence in the\nLibrary\u2019 as a mysterious\nstranger she was eventually revealed to be Rory\nand Amy\u2019s daughter\nwho, in the \ufb01nal episode\nof the previous series\nmarried the Doctor.\nUnlike many others I\ndon\u2019t have any serious problems with\nthe character herself,\nthough her relationship with the other\nthree main protagonists has been rather\ndisturbing at times,\nbut I believe that, given\nhow much the writers of\nthe show have made of\nher, she really has been\nunderused. Despite being the Doctor\u2019s wife she\nwasn\u2019t even mentioned\nthis series until her appearance in episode \ufb01ve. There were\nprecious few scenes between her\nand her parents, and none showing any signi\ufb01cant emotional development in the aftermath of\nthe many traumatic situations\nthey have faced together.\nThe audience has been left\nguessing why the Doctor fell in\nlove with her after remaining romantically aloof\nfor so many series and\nher limited screen time\nmeans that there simply\nhas been no time to show\nher and the Doctor acting as a couple. All this\nmakes her refusal to stay\nin the TARDIS with the\nDoctor for the \ufb02imsiest\nof non-reasons at the end\nof the latest episode even\nmore frustrating. The writers\nmade a bold, if controversial,\nmove in having the Doctor get\nmarried but unless they can develop the Doctor and River\u2019s relationship and show it having some\nconsequences on the story they\nshould just abandon this particular plotline.\nRant aside, this really is a good\nstart to the series. Episodes one\nto \ufb01ve should still be on iPlayer for a day or two after this review comes out\nand you should certainly\ncatch the show when it\nreturns this Christmas after\nthe mid-season break.\nI\nA match made in heaven? Apparently not...\n\n"

So, if you\u2019re the kind of person who likes to pay a\nlittle bit more for something more authentic, then Da Mario is somewhere\nyou should go. It\u2019s dangerously close to college and is a great place to fill up\nof food after a long day in the lab. There\u2019s also some pretty\nepic interior decorations going on, such as the great cartoon of Mario.\nThis is our top pick if you want a sophisticated birthday dinner with friends.\nThe menu caters to everyone\u2019s tastes and budgets, ranging from basic pizza\nand pasta dishes starting at around \u00a35 to more elaborate meat dishes for up\nto \u00a315. The best part of it, however, is that everyone gets to enjoy the Mediterranean d\u00e9cor and friendly staff, meaning you feel whisked away from any\nEnglish winter blues in a second. It really is a great atmosphere, sometimes\nyou worry that you\u2019ll get a ridiculous bill on your desk... Oh, and we should\nalso add that if you\u2019re timetable allows you to take a long lunch, Rocca gives\nall students a complimentary plate of bread when they eat there at lunch-times.

It\u2019s\njust by the entrance to South Ken station and easy to rush\nby. However, definitely stop by sometime and check it\nout. Huge pizzas, even huger dishes of\npasta, a slightly small but incredible garlic bread starter dish\nand friendly waiters / wait-resses.

    "content": "COMMENT\nake no mistake:\n\u201cThe Innocence of\nMuslims\u201d is a vile\n\ufb01lm, and an insult\nto the Founder of\nIslam and Muslims the world over. Yet\nthe response to it across the Muslim\nworld has done far more to tarnish the\nname of Islam than any short \ufb01lm ever\ncould.\nIt is, for the unacquainted, the amateur \ufb01lm which slandered the Founder\nof Islam in just about as many ways\nthat a 13 minute movie can slander an-yone, and the spark which lit the timber of so-called \u2018Muslim Rage\u2019 around\nthe world. Global protests ensued,\naimed primarily at US embassies, with\nmuch loss of life to both foreign and\nnational citizens. In Pakistan for ex-ample, whose government announced\na National Holiday to protest, well\nover 20 citizens have been killed \u2013\nmost of whom were policemen trying\nto contain the rioting. Such protests\ndo not represent the majority of the\npeaceful demonstrations that were\nheld. In fact, as ever, the handful of\nextremist Muslims that targeted embassies and killed ambassadors in the\npurported \u2018defence of Islam\u2019 do not\nrepresent the vast majority of the 1.6\nbillion Muslims worldwide that condemn both the \ufb01lm and the violence.\nHowever it is this \ufb01rebrand version\nof Islam that usually meets the public eye, and thus it is this extremism\nthat must be most publicly denounced\nby ordinary Muslims more than any-thing. Not doing so gives a full sense\nof justi\ufb01cation to the original \ufb01lmmakers who can simply say that their\npoint has been proved.\nHaving said that, let\u2019s not forget\nwhat originally caused the chaos. It\u2019s\neasy to fall for the narrative that this\nwas simply the case of hypersensitive\nMuslims searching for and \ufb01nding\nin\ufb02ammatory material. But a deeper\nlook into the history of the video reveals that this was not the case. The\noriginal \u2018trailer\u2019 was released back in\nearly July to absolutely zero e\ufb00ect by\n\u201cNakoula Basseley Nakoula,\u201d a man\nof extraordinarily low repute - being both a convicted fraudster and\nan ex-pornography director. Many\ndisappointing weeks later, the EgypRepel evil with what is best\nUmar Nasser\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\n... it is this\nextremism\nthat must be\nmost publicly\ndenounced\nby ordinary\nMuslims ...\ntian Christian anti-Islam activist\nMorris Sadek decided to upload an\nArabic-dubbed version of the \ufb01lm\nto YouTube, disseminated the link to\njournalists, and teamed up with the\nwell known US Pastor Terry Jones \u2013\nfamous for his \u201cBurn the Koran Day\u201d\nantics. Together, they publicised the\n\ufb01lm in conjunction with Jones\u2019 rather\ncomically-named \u201cInternational Judge\nMuhammad Day\u201d \u2013 which is held, of\ncourse, on 9/11. It was only after such\nconcerted e\ufb00orts by these extremist\nindividuals to get the video seen by\ntheir Muslim counterparts, that anything actually kicked o\ufb00.\nThere are many who are quick to cry\n\u2018freedom of speech\u2019 whenever such in\ufb02ammatory material is released. They,\nhowever, should realise that it is a fallacy to believe that speech is entirely\nfree, especially given the circumstances spelled out above. Hate-speech\nand anti-defamation laws abound in\nWestern countries, and rightly so.\nIn America, free speech is restricted\nwhen there is an intention or likelihood to cause imminent violence or\nlaw-breaking, and as such there is a\nstrong case for the creators and promoters of this \ufb01lm to fall under the\nscope of such limitations. Those who\nstill support the right for such views\nto be aired should at the very least\nemphasise their condemnation of this\nabuse of free speech, for the sake of\npeace and cohesion in society. If one\u2019s\nloved ones were publicly slandered\nwith no basis in truth, recourse to the\n\u2018free speech\u2019 argument would perhaps\nbe a tad slower. And it\u2019s important to\nrealise that for millions of Muslims\nworldwide, the Prophet Muhammad\n(pbuh) is more beloved to them than\nanyone else.\nNevertheless, the actions which extremist mobs carried out in his name\nbear no resemblance to the practice of the man himself. The Qur\u2019an,\nthe holy book of Muslims, is replete\nwith instructions to forgive and for-bear: \u2018\u2019And the servants of the Gracious God are those who walk on the\nearth in a digni\ufb01ed manner, and when\nthe ignorant address them, they say,\n\u2018Peace!\u2019\u2019 (25:64). Muslims believe that\nthe Prophet (pbuh) himself lived his\nlife entirely in accordance with the\nQur\u2019an, which instructs him: \u201cKeep to\nforgiveness, and enjoin kindness, and\nturn away from the ignorant.\u201d (7:200).\nThus how can those who violently\nprotest say they are defending his\nhonour, when their actions so clearly\ndefy his practices?\nIndeed the early history of Islam\nrecounts many instances of persecution of the Prophet Muhammad\n(pbuh), and yet on his eventual return\nto Mecca, when he had full power\nover his once-persecutors, he told\nthem that they were not going to be\npunished for their previous crimes\n\u2013 rather, that they were free. No retribution was exacted from the persecutors of the Prophet (pbuh) himself\nthat day, yet the extremists have taken\nthe lives of many innocents in the socalled \u2018defence\u2019 of his honour. Do they\nnot see that the Prophet Muhammad\n(pbuh) was instructed to, \u201cRepel evil\nwith that which is best. And lo,\u201d the\nQur\u2019an continues, \u201che between whom\nand thyself was enmity will become\nas though he were a warm friend.\u201d\n(41:35). Pertinent guidance indeed for\nthese troubled times \u2013 which Muslims\nand non-Muslims alike would do well\nto follow.\nFor a further discussion of these issues,\nconsider the event advertised below.\nM\n\n"

    "content": "Marie-Laure Hicks looks into political gossip from the Far East\nhina is one of the largest\nand fastest growing economies in the world and (to\nan extent) the country that\ngave us Jacqui Chan (I\u2019m totally going to watch Rush Hour now \u2013 Tim).\nAt a time when the rest of the world,\nespecially the Eurozone, is turning\ntowards China to solve their (money)\nproblems, China is having its own little personal troubles. The year 2012 is\nproving to be rich in political gossip.\nThe Bo Xilai Scandal\nBo Xilai was party secretary in\nChongqing. In February, his right\nhand Wang Lijun sought refuge in\nthe US consulate following a possible\ncorruption investigation. In March,\ncriticism mounted against Bo including from Wen Jiabao, the premier. In\nJuly, Bo\u2019s wife Gu Kailai was charged\nwith the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood and \ufb01nally given\na suspended death sentence. In September, Wang was tried in secret and\nsentenced to 15 years in jail, Bo was\nexpelled from the Communist party\nand charged with corruption, abuse of\npower, maintaining improper sexual\nrelationships and responsibility in relation to the murder.\nThe scandal has been perceived as\npolitically motivated, and one of the\nrare times the party has washed its\ndirty laundry in public. Bo\u2019s dismissal\nhas come as a surprise: he was seen as\na popular leader and up for promotion\nin the coming leadership succession.\nBo had developed a policy model that\ncomprised low-cost housing and wel-fare, a distribution of wealth, which\ndi\ufb00ers from the government\u2019s policy.\nThe scandal is still cloaked in mys-tery. Many question the o\ufb03cial story\nof the murder, cyanide poisoning over\na \ufb01nancial row, and claim that the Gu\nKailai present at the trial was a look-a-like. The charges raised against Bo\nhave also caused some di\ufb03culties to\nthe party as it is seen that these could\napply to a number of senior party\nmembers. Bo Xilai has not been seen\nsince the spring.\nThe Japanese Islands Dispute\nIt all started when the private owners\nof Senkaku/Diaoyu islands sold them\nto Japan. Japan, China and Taiwan all\nlay territorial claims over the islands.\nFollowing the acquisition, pre-existing\ntensions escalated. Protests broke out\nin China; some Japanese goods are being boycotted and a Toyota has been\nattacked; a \ufb02oat of Taiwanese ships\nwas pushed back by Japanese water\ncannons; 52,000 seats on \ufb02ights between China and Japan have been\ncancelled and a bullet was sent to the\nChinese embassy in Tokyo.\nConcerns that a military con\ufb02ict\nmight ensue were not appeased by\nChina launching its \ufb01rst aircraft car-rier. Military action however does not\nseem to be on the agenda of either\ncountry, economic and industrial ties\nbetween the nations are too impor-tant. Meetings over the row have begun on the side-lines of the UN General Assembly, although it is di\ufb03cult\nto see how either country can change\nits position with both Japan and China\nundergoing political change over the\nnext months.\nThe Ferrari Crash\nIn March, a Ferrari was involved in a\nbig car crash in Beijing. Within hours,\nphotos of the crash had been removed\nfrom the internet and searches for\nthe word \u201cFerrari\u201d had been blocked.\nMore recently, there have been claims\nthat the driver was the son of Ling Jihua, a prominent member of the ruling party. Ling Jihua has been reposi-tioned from head of the party\u2019s general\no\ufb03ce of the central committee to\nhead of the united front work department in September, likely preventing\na promotion to the Politburo during\nthe upcoming leadership succession.\nCritics believe this may be linked to\nthe Ferrari incident. The Party has\nbeen strongly criticised and scrutinised over the lifestyle and riches of\nits leading members. Revelations regarding the lavish lifestyle of Bo Xilai,\nhis relatives, and other Party members\nhas been a great embarrassment amid\ngrowing inequalities in the country.\nLeadership Succession\nOn 8th November 2012, the 18th\nChinese Communist Party congress\nwill start and the new leadership will\nbe announced. Successions in lead-erships have only occurred on three\nprevious occasions, with the \ufb01rst two\nresulting in the Cultural Revolution\nand the Tiananmen Square massa-cre. The general consensus is that Xi\nJinping will succeed as president and\nLi Keqiang as premier. The succession is much less clear concerning\nthe remaining members of the ruling\nPolitburo Standing Committee. During the congress, the Party is expected\nto put on a show of unity and conti-nuity, masking the divisions and factions within it. The European China\nResearch and Advice Network does\nnot expect any major shift in policy,\nwith the new leadership focusing\non growth and national interests. Xi\nJinping has however suggested possible democratic reforms in the long\nterm. Maintaining economic growth,\ncontrolling in\ufb02ation, and keeping the\npopulation happy will be the main\nchallenge. This change in power will\nshape the political landscape for the\nnext ten years and have to deal with\nthe world economic crisis, growing\ninternal inequalities, territorial dis-putes, a massive economy, and the\npower that comes with it.\nC\nIt\u2019s conference season, that time of\nthe year when the parties\u2019 eyes are all\n(overtly, at least) focused on the upcoming general election, and reading\nsome of the coverage of this weeks\u2019\nLabour and Lib Dem events you\u2019d be\nforgiven for thinking it was due to\ntake place in a couple of months rather than years. The Tories\u2019 have even\nlaunched their \ufb01rst anti-Labour poster of the election campaign: a crude\nbit of photoshopping of which Lord\nAshcroft said \u201cIf I had recently donated funds to the Tories I would be\nasking what on earth CCHQ thought\nit was doing with my money.\u201d [Might\nwe recommend you contact the Felix\nteam for better graphics works?]\nThe open question, even after these\ntwo years of debate, is whether we\u2019ll\nhave to wait till 2015 or not. The\ncoalition, however improbably, trundles on, and the picture from the Lib\nDems in Brighton last week suggests\nthey\u2019re still committed to the Coalition, but pushing hard to retain their\nseparate identity. Delegates voted to\ncontinue supporting Osborne\u2019s austerity measures, but also called on the\nparty to oppose the so called \u2018Secret\nCourts\u2019 legislation proposed by the\ncoalition.\nThe other big question with the Lib\nDems is whether these displays of independence are being noticed at all.\nLib Dem support has not so much\nstagnated as nose-dived. But two\nyears is a long time; it\u2019ll be an uphill\nstruggle, but the delegates in Brighton seemed united and with Ashdown\nbrought in to head the campaign the\nparty may well succeed in restoring\nitself.\nThe Labour conference in Manchester, meanwhile, seemed to be\nabout getting Ed Miliband noticed,\nand this is Labour\u2019s own uphill strug-gle. A triumphant address to party on\nTuesday seemed to earn him some\nmuch needed credibility, most of\nwhich seemingly evaporated the next\nmorning during an interview with\nEvan Davis on Today. For Labour, the\nnext two years are less launching a\nmanifesto as bolstering their leader.\nConferences and Confidence \u2013 or lack thereof?\nPadraic Calpin Politics Editor\nPOLITICS\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\n12\nPolitics Editors: Padraic Calpin\nMarie-Laure Hicks\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSex Scandal in Chongqing (and more important news)\nReuters AFP/Getty Images\nPA\nReuters Imaginechina\nSpot the difference?

Pay no heed to worries of mud, the rain and the cold: at\nBenic\u00e0ssim the sky is always blue, the\nsun always shines and the beach is at\nyour doorstep. And without the warm\ncoat, raincoat or wellies, there will\nbe plenty of room in your bag for the\nfashion essentials of the summer.\nEverything about the festival \u2013\nbright skies, boho atmosphere, booming sound system \u2013 comes together in\nperfect harmony with an unmissable\nline-up that demands your attention.\nBenicassim sees a beautiful mix of\nhazy indie, feel-good pop, and euphoric electro that will suit any music\nbu\ufb00\u2019s taste. The likes of Bob Dylan,\nThe Stone Roses, Ed Sheeran, Jessie\nJ and Chase & Status attracted thou-sands, and were crucial for setting the\nfashion scene.\nJessie J surprised with not only a\nbrilliant performance but also a great\nout\ufb01t. Mixing rock-chic with pretty-girl, she created a casual and original\nlook \u2013 her shaggy denim cut-o\ufb00s and\nbaggy tee complementing her enormous stage presence. An otherwise\nkitsch wolf print tee was balanced\nwith \ufb02oral designs and a matching\n\ufb02oral headband, nailing the classic\nfestival look!\nMiles Kane\u2019s tight leopard print\ntrouser worked alongside his \ufb02amboyant guyliner, blowing minimalistic\nstyle out of the water because the best\nthing about music festivals is that anything goes. As Kane himself said in\nan interview with Q magazine: \u201cIt is a\nshow! You have to feel it. If you feel it\u2019s\nright to wear leopard print and eye-liner, then do it.\u201d Wise words indeed.\nKaty B, an outspoken lover of play-suits, swapped her famous gold sequined one for a pretty, silk zip-up\nplaysuit with an original Hawaiian\nprint. Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs\u2019 Orlando Higginbottom, on\nthe other hand, preferred costumes,\ncombining his brilliantly crazy elec-tro-pop with wild beautiful dancers in\ndinosaur-themed out\ufb01ts, making for a\ntruly stunning show.\nBut let\u2019s not forget the festival goers\nthemselves with their well thought-out attention grabbing looks. Out\ufb01ts\nvaried from sexy, bohemian, and crea-tive, to downright bizarre. There were\ntreacherous troupes of nuns running\nwild through the festival, providing a totally new meaning to \u2018sinful\nstyle\u2019. Following the traditional meaning thereof, there were fanny packs/\nbum bags teamed unfortunately with\nspeedos, their bright neon styles\nbringing to mind the crying toddler\nfrom which they were stolen.\nAlthough technically there are no\nrules to festival fashion; a once a year\noccasion where you can wear whatever you want, from dinosaur costumes\nto simply running around in your\nunderwear, there are still many of us\nwho would like a little more guidance\nand inspiration.\nSo here, I give you the essential tips\nfor mastering the art of festival fashion to \ufb01nd the balance between fun\nand fashionable while looking e\ufb00ortlessly sassy and chic.\nSo escape the humdrum of London life and dance the night away at\nBenic\u00e0ssim, con\ufb01dent in what you\u2019re\nwearing. This illustrious festival has\nsimply everything going for it and will\nde\ufb01nitely be top of my list.\nSee you in Spain next summer!\nPhotos by Marianne Teoh\nT\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\n28\nHAIR\nBring along some Batiste Dry Shampoo (\u00a34.99 from Boots) or a sea salt spray\nto give you that curly beach bum look while keeping your hair manageable and\ndeceivingly fresh. Or, if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, try my recipe below and\nmake some yourself!\nGirls: A boho braided hairstyle will add so much to your look, whilst keeping\nhair off your face. Two cute plaits on each side are easy and effective, but given\nthat extremes are in, try keeping your hair as long as possible for a hippy look\nor cut it all off for an edgy style if you dare.\nHomemade Sea Salt Hairspray \u2013 a recipe for textured beach curls, for men and\nwomen\n1. Fill an 8oz spray bottle with warm water (distilled would be best \u2013 grab\nsome from labs)\n2. Add 1 Tbsp of fine sea salt\n3. Add a dab of hair gel to add styling control (I used Paul Mitchell Firm Hold\ngel)\n4. Add 1 tsp of a deep conditioner to prevent your hair drying out (I recommend Aussie 3-minute miracle deep conditioner. Coconut oil works well too\n\u2013 anything with coconut will give your hair a lovely beachy scent)\n5. Shake bottle well and spray generously on dry or damp hair, scrunching and\ntwisting as you go. Let your hair air dry and enjoy your tousled locks!\nACCESSORIES\nA trilby or a panama hat is a must-have for a beach holiday festival like Benic\u00e0ssim that can be jazzed\nup a notch by tying a scarf of flowers around it.\nHead bands, flower garlands, head scarves, and even feathered headdresses were all the rage this\nsummer. See Asos and Dolly Bow Bow for a brilliant range of headgear!\nHeadgear matched with bandeau tops are the way to go, whilst using floral print scarves as belts is\nan easy way to save packing space.\nCLOTHING\nBring things that are easy to wear: getting changed in your tent can be tricky.\nGuys: Don\u2019t try anything fancy, bring some trusty shorts and a few of your favourite vests and t-shirts. Roll up the sleeves and soak up the Spanish sun!\nGirls: Embrace the sunshine with a wispy and pretty summer dress, but don\u2019t forget the essential denim cut-off shorts and loose vests. These are comfortable, stylish, and go with absolutely\neverything.\nTOILETRIES\nBring miniatures: your shampoo, conditioner, shaving cream, and moisturiser will only be used a\nfew times and you don\u2019t want to lug big bottles around.\nTake PLENTY of sunscreen \u2013 the summer sun on the Spanish coast is powerful, and a bad burn\ncould ruin your weekend. The biggest fashion faux pas at Benic\u00e0ssim had to be the stereotypically\nlobster-skinned Brits mooching around camp, regretting their decision to leave the factor-25 at\nhome.\nSHOES\nFor the gloriously hot Benic\u00e0ssim festival, you really need a pair of comfy beach sandals to see you\nthrough the day (girls: don\u2019t bother bringing heels). And if you like your moshpits, invest in some\nlight and stylish trainers like Toms, Keds or Converses to protect your toes.\nCheck out Dolly Bow Bow (www.dollybowbow.co.uk), an online boutique that sells affordable\nvintage-chic clothes and accessories. If you don\u2019t have the time to string flowers together, you can get\nbeautiful floral headdresses from their online store.\nKaty B. Microphones\nare for losers, and tal-anted people \u2013 BURRRN\nUnlike in\nthe Olympics, she\nactually\nleft and\nstayed\naway\n\n"

    "content": "You\u2019re-a-Gamer Expo\nRoss Webster shares his experiences of Eurogamer 2012\nast weekend saw the start\nof the London Games\nFestival, heralded in by\nthe \ufb01fth Eurogamer Expo.\nNot exactly as groundbreaking as an Apple Keynote, the\nEurogamer (EG) Expo is a place for\ndevelopers and publishers to o\ufb00er up\ntheir latest works to the willing pub-lic, letting us play games months before their release. Being stretched over\nfour days, the expo holds a variety of\nunique developers Q&A sessions, and\nthe opportunity to meet developers \u2013\nindie and professional alike. There\u2019s\nthe usual mix of record-breaking\ngames with budgets larger than most\n\ufb01lms (slight exaggeration), but there\u2019s\nalso a fresh contingent of smaller developers who get to show o\ufb00 their pet\nprojects. Hosted in Earl\u2019s Court Exhibiton Centre (only a 30 minute walk\nfrom college) the EG expo initiates\nthe migration of many starved gamers towards the fertile lands of central London, ready for the autumnal\ndownpour.\nNow, as high revenue producing series are bound to sell, there is always\nthe problem of little change for the\nbig names. That being said, this year\u2019s\nEurogamer has brought out a lot of\nsequels and there seems to be some\nhope on the horizon. As examples,\nI\u2019ll have a couple of games stand up\nat the front of the class and I\u2019ll prod\nthem with my stick of analysis. Farcry\n3 seems to have recaptured some of\nthe fun of the original and Assassin\u2019s\nCreed 3 is now grittier and feels a lot\nmore \u2018lived-in\u2019. The atmosphere of the\nprevious AC games, despite being set\nin cities such as Rome, always lacked\nthe feeling of history and humanity. I\nunderstand that ruins should feel like\nruins, but these felt like ruins for ruins sake (I\u2019m trying to see how many\nruins I can get into this piece, before\nyou complain. Think of it like a psychological test. Or don\u2019t, that\u2019s the\npoint). Now, you\u2019re running through\npeople\u2019s houses, killing husbands and\nthe fathers of the children you see\nrunning about, and you can actually\nfeel a slight pang of guilt (I kid, I kid. I\nfeel nothing) which is great.\nOn the opposite side of the spec-trum, Eurogamer also gave us the\nchance to play around with a few sequels that have run a little o\ufb00-piste,\nseemingly grasping for originality.\nTomb Raider now has you controlling\na character who feels more like the\npublic schoolgirl she is, rather than\nthe bigger-breasted Harrison Ford\nwe all remember, and Metal Gear Revengeance is a futuristic Bayonetta\nthat bears as much resemblance to the\noriginal Metal Gear series as the Resident Evil movies to the games (yeah, I\nwent there).\nNot wanting to \ufb01ll these pages with\n(even more) drivel, I think I should\nget around to highlighting a few of my\nfavourites, that I wasn\u2019t expecting to\nsee. Firstly, The Un\ufb01nished Swan is a\nbeautiful concept for a game. In the\nrole of a young boy, you chase a swan\ninto an incomplete fantasy world. The\nphysical world exists all around you,\nbut there\u2019s no colour and no shadows,\nso your screen is initially pure white.\nYour one tool in this journey is a supply of paint blobs that you can throw\naround the place, covering the walls\nand \ufb02oors, so you can see where you\nneed to go. It might sound like an odd\nidea for a game, but I suggest you go\nand watch the trailer \u2013 http://giant-sparrow.com/games/swan/ (or just\nYouTube it like normal people). I met\na few people at the stall who had issues with the game from a brain-hurt\npoint of view, due to walking a few\nsteps and being surrounded by white\nagain, confusing that ever-so-squishy\npart of the brain that tells you if you\u2019re\ngoing crazy.\nOne of the fondly remembered classics in the Felix o\ufb03ce is Theme Hospital \u2013 a light-hearted hospital simulator that also had a wonderfully steep\nlearning curve if you wanted to excel.\nWe\u2019ve not seen games of its ilk for a\nlong time now, and we\u2019re now seeing\na return to the plan, build and run\nstyle of games. In Prison Architect,\nyou control the going-ons at a prison,\nmanaging the buildings and warden-ing team. The thing is, the engine of\nthe game doesn\u2019t feel speci\ufb01cally made\nfor the prison sim genre (I joke, but I\nexpect I\u2019ll get one through the post\nsoon). I expect that this is probably on\npurpose, and should allow for a steady\n\ufb02ow of games once this \ufb02agship game\nhas been released. I\u2019m just waiting for\nHalls of Residence Simulator 2013,\nbut can\u2019t help but feel it\u2019ll simply be a\nretitled Prison Architect. They won\u2019t\neven need to change the cover art.\nL\nPut simply, Dishonored is what you\nget if you ask the company who created Skyrim to go away and make\nBioshock. It\u2019s got the immersive atmosphere of the former but with the\nvibrant, larger-than-life visual style of\nthe latter \u2013 and it\u2019s a great combina-tion. The art director (who was a big\nplayer in creating the visuals for HalfLife 2) was going for \u201ca living painting\u201d, and has created something very\nreminiscent of steampunk but with\nall the colour left in. It\u2019s consistently\natmospheric and has got bucket-loads\nof attention to detail that despite the\nquirky theme gives the game a real,\nlived-in world.\nIn addition to the vivid graphics, Dishonored also takes a stab at one of my\npet peeves \u2013 games that are too easy.\nCombat is de\ufb01nitely not weighted in\nthe player\u2019s favour with considerable\nskill required to take on a room of bad\nguys and make it out alive, so stealth\ngameplay is very much encouraged.\nThis has its own set of di\ufb03culties as\nenemies are quick to notice when one\nof their number drop to the \ufb02oor, and\nthankfully they haven\u2019t inherited the\nincredibly limited vision skills of their\nElder Scrolls cousins, so staying hidden is not easy. All this adds up to\nchallenging gameplay that will probably surprise. It\u2019s easy to think you\u2019ve\nseen all these elements before and not\nreally take them as seriously as they\ndeserve \u2013 you\u2019ll be made to pay for\nthat mistake. Of course, getting beaten to a pulp over and over is just frustrating but it\u2019s refreshing to \ufb01nd that\nDishonored is not a game that\u2019s scared\nof sending you back to the start. The\nlevel I played was reasonably linear in\nit\u2019s design but there was still a lot of\nchoice: you could storm in crossbows\nblazing, hide in the shadows and take\nout the enemy one by one or even possess an innocent maid to get past the\nsecurity alarms \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of scope\nfor di\ufb00erent approaches. Apparently\nthere\u2019s also some open-world element\n(well, this is Bethesda) but details as\nyet are unclear.\nIn essence, Dishonored is de\ufb01nitely\na game to be getting excited about;\nI\u2019ve not been this excited for a new\ngame in far too long. You could argue\nthat we\u2019re just playing Bioshock with\na di\ufb00erent skin but with the latest in\nthat franchise still beyond the hori-zon, Dishonored may have beaten it\nto the post with it\u2019s fresh slice of dark,\nstealthy action.\nYeah, I know this isn\u2019t a swan. It\u2019s\nan emu. OBVS\nA Dishonorable Mention\nSimon Worthington Lame guy\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\n38\nDon\u2019t worry sir, I\u2019m just here to\nclean all of your gutters\n...WITH YOUR BLOOD\nSoap-dropping expansions out Q2\n2013.

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n37\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\nWhat we watched in September\nAnna Karenina (7th Sept)\nJoe Wright\u2019s bold, visually focused reinterpretation of a story that\u2019s been told\nmany, many times before starts off flaw-lessly, with colourful, slick set pieces and\nan intimate, theatrical ambiance, combined with a strong lead performance\nfrom Wright\u2019s regular collaborator, Keira Knightley in the title role. But it lacks\nconsistency and the emotional impact\nis severely cut short due to its need to\nsqueeze in as many characters and plot\npoints as possible. Wright however does\ndeserve praise for his ambition, and almost always hitting the mark.\nDredd (7th Sept)\nDon\u2019t be fooled into thinking that this is\nabout officers of the law having to \ufb01ght\ntheir way up a tall building to get to the\n\ufb01nal bad guy. There is a surprising lack of\nbullets \ufb01red, bones broken, corpses fall-ing, as often the \ufb01lm does too much talking for its own good. Karl Urban tries his\nbest to keep it all together in this futuristic science \ufb01ction action that naturally\nincludes some fancy guns and gadgets,\nbut in the end it never adds up to anything signi\ufb01cant.\nLawless (7th Sept)\nRaw, brutal and fearless, John Hillcoat\u2019s\nProhibition-era crime drama is certainly\nnot for the faint-hearted and you may be\nleft wanting more depth and clarity from\nsome of its underwritten characters. But\nthe star-studded ensemble comes across\nwonderfully well, with the always excellent and menacing Tom Hardy once\nagain on top form as the eldest of the\nBondurant bootlegger brothers, supplying alcohol and facing bloody consequences from a corrupt law enforcement\nofficer (Guy Pearce, in an over-the-top\nbrilliant performance) as a result.\nHope Springs (14th Sept)\nIt has nothing wise or original to say\nabout long-term relationships or marriages that have lost the passion, and the\nrushed, feel-good ending that attempts\nto tie everything up in one clean swoop\nis truly awful. However, it is anchored by\nexceptionally balanced performances\nfrom Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones\nas an elderly married couple looking to\nreignite the heat they once shared. It\nasks many difficult, uncomfortable ques-tions,mostly of a sexual nature, and their\nearnest attempts to give everything a try\nare both hysterical and tender.\nNow Is Good (19th Sept)\nDakota Fanning\u2019s withdrawn, distant\nperformance is one that grows on you as\ntime goes by, but you may have a hard\ntime sympathising with this girl early on,\nwhich is not good news, especially since\nshe\u2019s playing a young English girl from\nBrighton slowly dying of leukaemia. Faring a lot better is Jeremy Irvine as the\nsweet, doe-eyed love interest, and the\nolder generation of the cast, Paddy Considine and Olivia Williams, playing the\ngirl\u2019s dysfunctional divorced parents. It\u2019s\na real tear-jerker, with a suitably beautiful ending.\nHysteria (21st Sept)\nThanks to the brilliant mind of a doctor\nat the end of the 19th Century and his\nrich best friend, women nowadays get\nto enjoy vibrators. Despite its subject\nmatter, which could easily be turned\ninto a crass, mocking farce, the direction\nremains sensitive, taking logical steps\nto explain the course of events. Hugh\nDancy is bright and enthusiastic as the\ndoctor, Rupert Everett is the excellent\ncomic friend, and Maggie Gyllenhaal\nthrives as a free-thinking, independent\nwoman who gets tangled up in this historic invention.\nKilling Them Softly (21st Sept)\nThe narrative\u2019s parallel to the state of\nworldeconomics,focusingmainlyonthe\n2008 \ufb01nancial crisis and its aftermath,\ncan be tough to take in, and this is in no\nway an easy \ufb01lm to sit through, but with\nmuch dense and cleverly written dialogue delivered with such skill and poise\nby a strong ensemble of actors (Brad\nPitt, James Gandol\ufb01ni, Richard Jenkins,\nBen Mendelsohn, Scott McNairy), this\nalso has time for some incredible slow-mo action that proves Andrew Dominik\nis one of the most fascinating directors\naround.\nSavages (21st Sept)\nIt\u2019s overlong, and has an absurd, almost\nunnecessary narration from the irritating Blake Lively who leads a luxurious,\ncomfortable life shacking up with two\nsuccessful pot-growers (Taylor Kitsch,\nAaron Taylor-Johnson). Enter a Mexican drug cartel headed by the excellent\nSalma Hayek and her sly, not too brainy\nsecond-in-command Benicio del Toro,\nand then we get kidnapping, shoot-outs\nand some interesting developments.\nShame about the convoluted plot that\nsidetracks one too many times, and an\nunsatisfactory ending that wraps things\nup with little consideration for its char-acters.\nUntouchable (21st Sept)\nThe box-office hit that was the cinematic\nexperience to beat in France, (currently\nthe second most successful \ufb01lm ever\nthere) \u201cLes Intouchables\u201d tells the amazingly moving and true story of an unlikely friendship that strikes up between\na quadriplegic millionaire and a young\nman recently out of prison. Despite the\nfamiliarity you will notice from its predictable storytelling, it\u2019s no surprise to\ndiscover this massive crowd-pleaser was\nsuch a success, and it\u2019s largely thanks to\nthe two fantastic leads, Francois Cluzet\nand Omar Sy.\nLooper (28th Sept)\nCalling this the new Matrix is stretching\nit a bit, but with an intriguing concept\ninvolving time travel, it has a deep emotional back story and takes its time, logically building everything up to its loud\n\ufb01nale. In a distant future where criminal\norganisations send off victims they want\ndead back into the past, it\u2019s the Looper\u2019s\njob to take care of it. Things get complicated as Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)\ncomes face to face with his future self\n(Bruce Willis), who also has an agenda\nof his own.\nResident Evil: Retribution (28th Sept)\nThe \ufb01fth entry into this tiresome, repetitive franchise \ufb01nds no real improve-ment, with Milla Jovovich dressed up\nonce again in a dominatrix costume,\nslaying evil zombies, \ufb01ghting Umbrella\nCorporation with cool weapons. There\nare some returning characters, but re-ally, who remembers or cares about any\nof them. Thankfully the next instalment\npromises to be the last one, and given\nthe way this one ends, sets up to be an\nepic \ufb01nale. But until then, we\u2019ll just have\nto settle for this mediocre effort.\nI told you not to touch my fucking\ntest tube again. I\u2019d JUST washed it\n\n"

    "content": "56th BFI London Film Festival\nEvery year, the British Film Institute\n(BFI) hosts Britain\u2019s biggest, most excit-ing, star-studded film event, the London\nFilm Festival, where directors worldwide\nget the chance to share their accomplishments with the public. As one of the\nmost accessible film festivals around,\nany eager movie fans in London should\ntry to catch a screening or two. Packed\nfull with big-scale red carpet premieres,\nin focus Q&A sessions with the stars, the\nfestival is truly an exciting occasion to be\ntaken advantage of.\nMany renowned filmmakers use this\nevent as a platform to drive and sustain\npublicity surrounding their films that\ncould be serious contenders come the\nawards season. After Berlin in February,\nCannes in May, Venice and Toronto in\nSeptember, the next one down the list is\nLondon in October, which would explain\nthe heavy presence of international press\ntuning in to see which worthy films will\nstand out from the crowded line-up for\nfurther acclaim. Last year, The Artist, hot\noff its Best Actor win from Cannes arrived in London to wide critical praise.\nThe following year it walked away with\nthe Best Picture at the 2012 Academy\nAwards. This, as well as other highly\nregarded directors (last year\u2019s guests\ninclude Mike Leigh, Fernando Meirelles,\nTerence Davies, George Clooney, Alexander Payne, Madonna, Ralph Fiennes,\nDavid Cronenberg, Steve McQueen\n(obviously, not the dead movie star, the\ndirector)) submitting their work for\nconsideration, shows the festival\u2019s high-standing reputation within the film com-munity.\nClare Stewart, taking over the position\nof Festival Director from Sandra Hebron,\nhas prepared a shorter but more compact programme of more than 200 feature films shown across more boroughs\nof London, aside from the usual Leicester\nSquare venues.\nThe festival opens on 10th October\nwith Tim Burton\u2018s Frankenweenie serving as its Opening Gala film, and the film\nwill also be shown simultaneously across\nthirty separate locations, a first for the\nfestival. Burton\u2019s new 3D stop-motion\nanimation tells the story of a young boy\nwho manages to resurrect his dead dog\nbut also finds that there are consequences with messing with death.\nClosing the festival on 21st October is\nMike Newell\u2019s visually dazzling adaptation of Charles Dickens\u2019 most beloved\nnovel, Great Expectations, starring\nRalph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter\nand English rising star Jeremy Irvine\nas Pip, a penniless orphan who climbs\nthe London society\u2019s ladder thanks to\nunexpected help from a mysterious\nbenefactor.\nThe full programme and detailed ticketing information are available on the\nBFI London Film Festival website: www.\nbfi.org.uk/lff\nJohn Park Film Editor\nFILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n35\n5 hotly anticipated films of\nthis year\u2019s festival:\nAmour:\nMichael Haneke\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or winning film has recently been confirmed as\nAustria\u2019s entry for next year\u2019s Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars. This\nextraordinarily moving film about an elderly couple having to cope with deteriorating conditions and ultimately, death, has received universal praise since\nits debut at Cannes.\nRust + Bone:\nAnother breakout hit from Cannes, Jacques Audiard\u2019s intense, touching love\nstory between a killer whale trainer (Marion Cotillard) and an aimless bouncer\n(Matthias Schoenaerts) has been noted for its two brilliant lead performances.\nTheir relationship is put to the test when Stephanie goes through a horrific accident and finds her legs have been amputated.\nThe Sessions:\nSundance loved it, Toronto loved it, and now it\u2019s London turn to fall in love\nwith this unlikely blend of poignant drama and hysterical comedy as a man in\nan iron lung (John Hawkes) attempts to lose his virginity with the help from\nhis forward-thinking priest (William H. Macy) and a sympathetic sex therapist\n(Helen Hunt).\nArgo:\nCritics are praising Ben Affleck\u2019s third directorial effort in which he handles\na gripping, \u201cbased-on-a-true-story\u201d thriller with style, heart and panache. 6\nAmerican citizens hiding out in the Canadian ambassador\u2019s house during the\nIranian revolution attempt to escape; and it\u2019s down to a group of CIA agents to\nplan an almost impossible rescue mission, by posing as a film crew.\nEnd of Watch:\nNo, despite its premise, this is not your average cop-buddy drama. What sets\nthis apart isn\u2019t just down to its handheld style of filming. Its action scenes are\nintense and bubbling with energy, and the characters (Jake Gyllenhaal and\nMichael Pena, sharing great on-screen chemistry) are put through all sorts of\nhoops as they anger the wrong Mexican drug cartel.\nJohn Park\nNo, this is not the Tim Burton film\nThis is...\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\nFilm Editor\n\n"

You get a lot of talk nowadays about how varied and eclectic people\u2019s\nmusic taste is; but fuck that. I love the good\nold fashioned indie pop as well as art-punk\nand shoegaze and right now I have the Vaccines album on repeat (\u2026 so sue me if they are\nnot cool).\nMUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter,\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nYou Don\u2019t Have To\nCall It Music\nPt. O caveat lector\nby \u00cd\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nMusic is wonderful, wouldn\u2019t you agree? It stirs up a great deal in one\u2019s being.\nIt makes the foot tap, the heart beat slower and faster, and floods the mind\nwith memories and emotions. Beyond a psychophysiological episode, it actually tells us a lot about ourselves and our humanity, when other means just\naren\u2019t enough.\nAnd yet most of it is all too familiar. For such a miracle of our sensory ap-paratus, it seems a shame to let it lull us into a numbing comfort to rest the\nmind to; to get drunk to; to shop to. It has been brutally distilled into a mere\nsedative; an instant relief to the daily pain. Hardly ever considered a force\nof sublime pleasure, the acme of aesthetics; it\u2019s essence is now cut with the\nbreeze of the refrigerator aisle, the stench of alcohol in sweat and vomit, and\nis ultimately overridden by an end of the electromagnetic spectrum designed\nto burn your retinas.\nKierkegaard once argued that music was the most perfect form of art. As\nridiculous a claim as it may be, he championed it\u2019s ability to represent the human condition in more ways than a still painting or a petrified sculpture could\never convey. It appears and vanishes just as quickly, leaving no physical impression on the world, no proof that it ever existed, and yet it grasps us more\nclosely and tightly than any extended rumination on a vision of an embrace\nor a crucifixion. But then again, one could argue he wasn\u2019t getting laid too\noften either. (He made his claim in an essay titled \u201cThe Immediate Stages of\nthe Erotic\u201c.)\nIntellectualising music is no less pretentious than a crooner\u2019s love-drunk wit-ticisms. Lyrics express ideas very literally, but the intangible nature of music\nleaves a lot to the imagination. Unfortunately, when others\u2019 opinions are, in\nthe words of the Straight Edge Boston punk band SSD, \u201cForced Down Your\nThroat\u201d, it\u2019s hard to keep your mind your own. The ambiguity of a musical\nstatement means every listener has a completely personal experience. Hearing a sound might bring back special memories or tie the listener to an aesthetic they might identify with, but any meaning of the music alone is open to\ninterpretation. In all honesty, chances are, you won\u2019t even think about it any\nmore, but start feeling it instead. It falls North of the line between intuition\nand influence.\nWhen was the last time you put a record on and did nothing but listen to it?\nHow many songs have you heard today without even noticing them? What\nsilly things did the supermarket sound system make you buy today?\nThis column is about the more adventurous exploits of musical creativity in\nmodern times. Those who remain the most quiet when they have something\nto say. Who don\u2019t lie in the open, bare but empty, and are often hard to find\neven with conviction.\nFrom the earliest experiments with tape loops, when train tracks were first\nused as rhythm, until the latest inclinations to let machines do the singing\nor remove the human touch entirely from the equation. When wars tore art\napart, as it did to the sum of civilization, and composers felt harmonic excess\ncould no longer speak to the heart of man. When police brutality led young\npunks from the street to the studio. When perspectives both political and\nperceptual were challenged and deracinated. Modern times aren\u2019t straight\nforward. They\u2019re not easy to face, digest or accept. The sign of the times is as\nuncertain as ever, and the panorama is shifting faster than ever before. Sometimes silence can be the strongest stance.\nMostofthesetendenciescan,insomeway,bedescribedasexperimental.It\u2019s\nhard to describe them in simpler terms without appending this unfortunate\nmisnomer, but, in the words of Howard Stelzer of Intransitive Recordings, the\n\u201cexperimental\u201d label is \u201cgeneral enough to mean something to somebody\u201d. It\nis this experimentation that keeps music, and all things, moving forward, even\nif it results in a blown amplifier or a perforated ear drum. The moon was never\nin our back garden, nor jazz simply at the tip of our fingers. It takes some spirit\nand brave curiosity to search new ground, but we\u2019d be all the poorer for not\ntrying.\nI\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything devilish about getting down to some Marvin\nGaye every once in a full moon, but the cochlea does curl deeper than its harmonic creases. These corners behind the octaves are worth tickling from time\nto time, just to remind your brain they\u2019re there.\nHot albums...

There are too many interlude tracks\nand filler to compete with some of the\nvery best releases, but its undoubted\nstrengthlieswiththeeffevescentsingles.\nMark England\nThe Brewis brothers\u2019 fourth album is\npossibly their finest to date, and finally\nstarts to garner them some of the acclaim that they have so richly deserved.\nMany are giving the Sunderland boys\nlittle chance with competition from the\nMaccabees and Plan-B, but write them\noffatyourperil.\nPlumb is most definitely a pop album,\nwith more hooks than a Prince best-of,\nyet it still pursues a distinct and \u2018odd\u2019\naesthetic. This album could be called\nfragmentorybutthatiswhereitsbeauty\nlies: the jumble of ideas, the lyrics laced\nwith self doubt, and the intelligent pop\nchorusesallmakethisalbumawinner.\nMark England\nFresh from supporting Adele, Michael\nKiwanuka sings the sort of soulful sh-mooze which you would expect, and\nyour mum would probably love. Myself, I am undecided about the merits\nof Mr Kiwanuka\u2019s spiel. I cannot debate\nthat this a wholly accomplished album,\nbut it doesn\u2019t grab me at all. I think ret-romania has passed me by completely.\nThe romance of \u2018Bones\u2019 is a standout\nmoment, but there is so much polish\non this record that the best songs are\nlost under their own production. Coming from a poor North London back-ground, I was hoping for a mix of grit\nand gloss, but sadly that is lacking.\nMark England\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\n32\nMeet the editors\nI\u2019m Ross and I am going into my third year of\nPhysics.

Trained\nin painting early on in life, but with\nan inexhaustible fascination for scienti\ufb01c learning, he collected \u2018interests\u2019\nlike one might collect ticket stubs. He\ntook care of each one, obsessing over\nit, although, as happens often with\nhobbies, forgetting about then for a\nwhile. Leonardo\u2019s works on anatomy\nwere some of the most detailed he\ncarried out, intending for them to be\npublished. His beginnings in the \ufb01eld\nconcerned the true representation of\nnature, in particular human and animal images, in art. Initially, Leonardo\nwanted to describe human nature, in\nits physiological and psychological as-pects, for a treatise on painting.\nHis \ufb01rst anatomical studies were of\nlittle scienti\ufb01c value, being, in essence,\namalgamations of ancient knowledge.\nEven so, they were compelling for their\ninventiveness and (somehow) wit. One\ndrawing depicts, in hemisection, a man\nand a woman having sex, where some\nspiritual beliefs of the era \u2013 such as the\nbelief that semen comes from the head\n\u2013 win out over science.\nHowever, when Leonardo began dissecting animals and obtained access to\nhuman remains, his anatomical drawings became observations, and occa-sionally, interpretations, of the truth.\nHe was, moreover, capable of accepting the new ideas that resulted from his\ndescriptive studies, thus progressing to\na degree unparalleled in 15th century\nanatomy. There are drawings of his that\ncan favourably compare to modern\nanatomical work. For example, a study\nexposing the muscles in the leg is remarkable for the precision with which\nLeonardo carried out the dissection,\nespecially under the adverse conditions\nprevailing at the time, with cadavers\nun-embalmed and falling apart.\nThe scienti\ufb01c accuracy of the anatomical drawings is paramount to their\nsuccess. But their supreme beauty,\ncommonly associated with Leonardo\u2019s\nworks, is what gives them life and vig-our. The delicacy of a drawing depicting the nervous system, including some\nof the complexities of cranial nerves,\nspinal cord and spinal nerves, is en-trancing. Whilst looking at this representation of nature, one could imagine\ninstead seeing a ghostly \ufb01gure clothed\nin a web of in\ufb01nite knowledge. There\nis, for one further example, a drawing that, whilst confused anatomically,\nposits a solution that could be seen as\nWith most of the advertising targeting\nthe Freshers, Monday\u2019s Big Tickle comedy evening seemed to have slipped\npast the rest of the college unnoticed.\nDespite this, the predominantly fresher\nbased audience gave the comics plenty\nto work with. Where else, but Imperial,\nwould a debate over whether a pterodactyl (or more correctly, a pterosaur)\nis a dinosaur or a ring tone of R2-D2\u2019s\nbeeps and whistles get truly appreci-ated?\nAdlibbing aside, however, the evening was pretty uneventful.

With a large chunk of the\naudience being international, some of\nthe material seemed a poor choice \u2013 although the evening was a good introduction to the British sense of humour,\nwhich may yet prove helpful as they\nstart their courses.\nBilled by the Union as \u201csome of the\nbest young comedy stars\u201d, they got\nit right on the head. Mark and Luke\nseemed to struggle though their material and even the headliner, Ed Gamble,\nresorted to an impromptu rapport with\na stoned member of the audience to\nkeep his set going.\nDespite all this, the event had a good\naudience and bodes well for future\ncomedy here at Imperial \u2013 something\nthat we appear to trail other universities on.

Greg\nHands said that \u2018the whole process\nis in danger of being driven by land\nvalues and the Trust\u2019s ambitions instead of the best care for patients\nacross West London\u2019.\nGreg Hands continued on to say\nthat \u201cmaking sure there is 24/7 cover\nfrom consultants is obviously good;\nleaving an entire London borough\nwithout an A&E is not. At the mo-ment, this seems to be about Imperial NHS Trust\u2019s needs, not patients\u2019\nneeds. I am fighting hard to change\nthat\u201d.\nMedical students of Imperial College London use both hospitals for\nteaching, and concerns have been\nmade as to how this will affect Imperial medics. If the plans go through\nCharing Cross will no longer be a\nteaching hospital, which will have a\nbig impact on the way medicine is\ntaught at Imperial. ICSM President,\nShiv Vohra, commented saying: \u201cAt\nthe moment students are in the dark\nas to what the proposals will mean\nfor their future education, and would\nlike to be kept in the loop about the\nplanned changes and how it will affect them. Particularly in relation to\nthe Charing Cross hospital, which is\nthe hub of the medical school.\u201d\nFelix asked a spokeswoman from\nImperial College Healthcare NHS\nTrust, about whether the changes\nwould have a positive or negative effect on education. In her response\nshe mentioned that, \u201cthe three options will affect the Trust in differing ways and as a consultee the Trust\nis considering what the proposals mean for our services, staff and\nsites. We have agreed with Imperial\nCollege London that we will formulate a joint response as an Academic\nHealth Science Centre (AHSC) as it\nis crucial that the feedback includes\nhow these proposals will affect the\nAHSC\u2019s tripartite mission of vastly\nimproving healthcare through ser-vice, education and research.\u201d\nWith the public consultation ending on 6th October and the proposed\nchanges taking up to three years to\nbe implemented, it could be a while\nbefore the exact effects to medical\nstudents and patients is known.\nFreshers\u2019 Week ends\nA few photos from The Mingle.

The Red Shoes (1948)\nLong before Darren Aronofsky\nshocked us all with his brutal and\nbloody \u201cBlack Swan\u201d, English \ufb01lmmakers Michael Powell and Emeric\nPressburger had already tapped into\nthe cut-throat world of ballet with\ntheir fearless adaptation of Hans\nChristian Andersen\u2019s fairytale story\nof the same name. It\u2019s an immensely\nstylish, haunting portrayal of a woman forever trapped in the seemingly\ninescapable world, and the world of\nballet has never looked more hardcore and yet so beautiful. Directors\nBrian De Palma and Martin Scorsese\nlist this as one of their favourite \ufb01lms.\n9. The Bicycle Thief (1948)\nThe go-to \ufb01lm when anyone is talking\nabout Italian neo-realism (Roberto\nRossellini, Federico Fellini etc), or\nItalian cinema in general, there isn\u2019t\na \ufb01nal shot that is more heartbreaking or endearing as the one presented\nhere. Non-actors were hired to play\nthe parts, which further heightens\nthe un\ufb02inchingly authentic look the\n\ufb01lm is so consistently praised for. Set\nin post-World War II Italy, a struggling father has his bicycle stolen,\nwhich he needs for a job he cannot afford to lose. Together with his son the\ntwo set out to search for it in the busy\nstreets of Rome.\nRecently, the British Film Institute\n(BFI) released the results of their\ncelebrated poll, \u201cTHE GREATEST\nFILMS OF ALL TIME\u201d, in which they\nsurveyed \ufb01lm critics and directors to\nlist their ten favourite \ufb01lms. Now the\nFelix Film team, as much as we\u2019d love\nto, doesn\u2019t have that kind of time or\nresources. And so we decided to split\nthe \ufb01lms up according to the decades\nin which they were released. So every\nweek, we will present you with our top\n\ufb01lms of each decade, so what comes\nafter 1930s...erm...oh yes, the 40s.\n8. Brief Encounter (1945)\nSure it\u2019s the story of an emotional love\na\ufb00air between two individuals who\ndon\u2019t quite have a good enough reason to be unhappy in their respective\nrelationships, but in its warm, sympathetic direction and committed performances from the very few members of the cast, especially the quietly\noutstanding Celia Johnson, what we\nget here is a carefully laid out, deeply\ntouching and possibly at times devastating portrayal of potential love\nand passion that simply can never be.\nIt\u2019s heartbreaking, yet low-key and\ntender, a gentle, soothing mixture of\ntouching emotions.\n7.LeaveHertoHeaven(1945)\nGene Tierney makes one hell of a\nfemme fatale as the beautiful, seductive yet highly dangerous, unpredictable and obsessive Ellen, murdering,\nblackmailing, lying and manipulating her way into the heart of the man\nshe greatly desires. Filmed in gorgeous colours that do wonders for\nTierney\u2019s sharp, piercing features,\nthis shows the actress on top form,\nas well as some shocking plot developments considered controversial\nfor its time, that still ring true even\nto this day. It\u2019s a brutal and merciless\ntale of cut-throat, sel\ufb01sh \ufb01xation that\nis also made with irresistible beauty.\n6. Mildred Pierce (1945)\nAfter years of absence from the\nscreen, Joan Crawford, fresh out of\nher terminated contract with MGM,\nstriking up a new deal with Warner\nBrothers, actively sought out this\nleading role, and her e\ufb00orts certainly\npaid o\ufb00, as her only Oscar win came\nfrom her portrayal of the titular selfless single mother who lets her unconditional love for her children get\nthe better of her during the aftermath of The Great Depression. Told\nin \ufb02ashback sequences after a scene\nof a mysterious murder, it also adds\nan element of noir in the midst of the\nmelodrama.\n5. The Lady Eve (1941)\nBetween Henry Fonda and Barbara\nStanwyck, whose bright and sparkling\ndynamic that immediately comes right\no\ufb00 the screen is enough of a worthy fea-ture, we are also treated to a delightful\nlittle screwball comedy package that\nbalancesnotonlythebiglaughsbutalso\nan underlying subplot of three con-art-ists trying to scam an eligible bachelor.\nThe sassy Stanwyck and well-meaning\nbut ever-so dim and charmingly awkward Fonda make one appealing duo\nand they e\ufb00ortlessly win us all over with\ntheir romance. Stanwyck\u2019s wedding\ngown caused a major fashion boom,\ndubbed the \u201cThe Lady Eve Dress\u201d.\n4. His Girl Friday (1940)\nIt moves at an extraordinary pace,\nwith clever, witty lines rapidly \ufb01red\nby actors who are endlessly watcha-ble. The outstanding Cary Grant and\nRosalind Russell play journalists on\nthe hunt for a big news story about\nto blow wide open. The catch is that\nthe two of them used to be married,\nwith the ex-wife now about to marry\na new man. The ex-husband tries to\nuse every trick up his sleeve to prevent this from happening, whilst\ntrying to land this article. And the\nresult of this unstable mixture?\nChaos. Complete and utter hysterical chaos.\n3. It\u2019s a Wonderful Life (1946)\nEvery year near the Christmas period you will always, always, always,\nalways, always \ufb01nd at least one channel on television broadcasting the\nmost quintessential holiday movie of\nall time. Although opening to mixed\nreviews at the time of its \ufb01rst release,\ntime has only been an asset to Frank\nCapra\u2019s post-war e\ufb00orts with James\nStewart in his \ufb01rst role after his time\nserved in the military. It celebrates\nlife, love, and everything that is good,\nhonest and true in the world. Maybe\nsomething a broken world wasn\u2019t\nquite ready to see, but a highly uplifting tale nonetheless.\n2. Double Indemnity (1944)\nAnother Barbara Stanwyck picture\nhere, but this time she is a striking yet deadly femme fatale (there\nwere a lot of them back in the days\nof black-and-white cinema), luring\na well-behaved insurance agent into\ncommitting murder to double a life-insurance payout. The \ufb01lm\u2019s mood\nremains dark and foggy throughout,\nas one unpredictable and menacing\nrevelation after another await its\ntightly scripted plot. Billy Wilder became a prominent name, with even\nAlfred Hitchcock remarking the two\nmost important words in motion\npictures are \u201cBilly\u201d and \u201cWilder.\u201d\n1. Casablanca (1942)\nPlayboy Hugh Hefner\u2019s favourite \ufb01lm\nof all time; his reason being that it\nhas everything: \u201ca fantastic script,\nadventure, romance, unrequited love,\nfriendship\u2026everything.\u201d Never were\ntruer words spoken, as the winner\nof the 1940s decade goes to a timeless love story set in the African\ncity during the chaos of World War\nII. Humphrey Bogart\u2019s \ufb01nal act is\nheart-wrenchingly beautiful, Ingrid\nBergman is his equally e\ufb00ective true\nlove, and the endlessly quotable lines\n(\u201chere\u2019s looking at you, kid\u201d being one\nof many) all help shape the lasting appeal of its romanticism.\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n31\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\nSome facelifts just don\u2019t\nwork as well as others\nBelieve the hype\nMaciej Matuszewski looks at Hyperion \u2014 a classic of SF\nvery much enjoy short works\nof \ufb01ction. What they may lack\nin depth compared to longer\nworks they often make up for\nin greater focus. You can read\nthe story in one sitting and not be distracted by any \ufb01ller \u2014 making it easier\nfor you to get to the core of the issues\nbeing explored.\nDan Simmons\u2019 Hyperion is an almost unique novel in how it combines\nthe best features of both longer and\nshorter forms of \ufb01ction. The book is\nset in the 28th century, where the Hegemony of Man has colonised much of\nthe galaxy with the help of the arti\ufb01cial intelligences it has created. When\nthe breakaway human group known as\nthe Ousters threatens the distant colony world of Hyperion with invasion,\nseven pilgrims are sent to the planet\nto attempt, for the last time, to contact\nthe entity known as The Shrike \u2014 a\nseemingly alien, godlike creature that\nthrives on pain. During their journey\nto the Time Tombs, where The Shrike\nresides, the seven each tell each other\nthe stories of their lives and what drew\nthem to this pilgrimage. These stories\nwork well as individual pieces of \ufb01ction (indeed the \ufb01nal one, \u2018Remembering Siri\u2019 was published on its own\nbefore the rest of the book was even\nwritten) but, taken together, they\nslowly reveal more and more not only\nabout the fascinating characters but\nalso about The Shrike and the reasons\nfor both the pilgrimage and the Ouster invasion.\nOne could argue that Hyperion\nsimply provides the back-story and\nexposition necessary to understand\nits three more action \ufb01lled sequels\nbut that would be unfair to the novel.\nHyperion is a masterful exercise in\nworldbuilding, creating a rich, detailed and believable universe. It respects the reader\u2019s intelligence, with\ncrucial facts being revealed subtly and\ncomplex situations being presented\ndi\ufb00erently from the points of view of\ndi\ufb00erent characters.\nThe three sequels \u2014 Fall of Hyperion, Endymion and Rise of Endymion \u2014 abandon this Canterbury Tales\nstyle storytelling to their detriment.\nAs is often the case with a long, uninterrupted narrative the story very easily becomes confused. The books try\nto tackle many weighty topics, such\nas the role of religion or the attitude\nof highly advanced AIs towards their\nhuman creators, but the themes often\ndon\u2019t \ufb01t together and not all are satis-fyingly resolved. Various small inconsistencies and plot holes also begin to\nappear as the story progresses. While\nnone of these are fatal to the narrative\nthey do become increasingly annoy-ing. The worst example of this is when\na very likable character from the \ufb01rst\nnovel is brought back in the third as\nthe genocidal dictator of an oppressive theocratic empire with the only\nreason given for this abrupt change in\npersonality being a statement that he\nwas \u201cweak willed\u201d.\nI\u2019m not saying that the sequels are\nbad. Beneath their many problems\nthey tell a compelling story. My main\ncriticism is that they do not live up to\nthe promise of the \ufb01rst novel, which\nwas a near masterpiece. They\u2019re enjoyable reading and probably worth a\nlook. The \ufb01rst novel, however, is certainly worth a look \u2014 it\u2019s a true classic\nof the science \ufb01ction genre.\nI\nEarthsea \u2014 a truly magical series\nMaciej Matuszewski Books Editor\nWant to see your name in print?\nSend your book reviews and features to books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCaptions here totally\nruin the front cover...\nI\u2019m generally not a big fantasy reader\nbut I had heard a lot of good things\nabout Ursula Le Guinn\u2019s Earthsea series and so had very high expectations\nbefore I started reading it. I wasn\u2019t\ndisappointed. Whilst featuring many\nstandard western fantasy elements\n\u2212 kings, wizards and dragons \u2212 the\nbooks are unique for their setting on\nan archipelago of many hundreds of\nislands. For a series that was begun in\nthe 60s there is a great deal of freshness to the Earthsea stories, especially for those who have grown tired of\nfantasies set in pastiches of medieval\nEngland.\nThe books have often been compared to The Lord of Rings and while\nher worldbuilding is not quite up to\nTolkien\u2019s standards, le Guinn has still\ninvested a considerable amount of effort in creating a varied, interesting\nworld. There is a rich and detailed\nback-story and each of the islands that\nwe visit has a unique and memorable\natmosphere to it. They are \ufb01lled with\nmagic and mystery but also feel like\nreal places, places that you could and\nwould want to visit. By the time you\nhave \ufb01nished the books their names \u2013\nHavnor, Selidor, Gont, Roke and many\nothers \u2013 will be \ufb01xed in your mind.\nThe story of the books takes place\nover a number of decades near the end\nof a dark age for the Archipelago; with\none of the main plot strands being\nthe restoration of the islands\u2019 monarchy and the consequences that this\nbrings. The \ufb01rst novel of the series, A\nWizard of Earthsea, was written early\nin Le Guinn\u2019s career \u2013 which can be\nfelt in its less than perfect pacing and\ncharacterisation \u2013 however she soon\nimproved and by the third novel, The\nFarthest Shore, she had already established herself as one of the foremost\nwriters in the genre. Her characters\nare rich and believable and her plots\nretain a feeling of wonder without\neven coming close to breaking the\nreader\u2019s suspension of disbelief. Despite the fantastical setting, one of the\n\ufb01rst words that comes to mind when\ndescribing the series is \u2018relatable\u2019 and\nLe Guinn draws in the readers by subtly focusing her writing on issues that\nare relevant to her readers.\nLe Guinn originally didn\u2019t intend\nthe series to go on for as many books\nas it did but unlike other series in\nwhich new, originally unplanned\ninstalments descend into self indulgence by the author \u2013 of which the\nDune series is probably the best example \u2013 the quality here remains\nhigh throughout. There is a clear\nsplit between the two halves of the\nseries, with the \ufb01rst three novels being straight action adventure and the\nlater books being more contemplative\nand dealing with more serious issues\nsuch as feminism and \ufb01nding one\u2019s\npurpose in life. Despite this, the two\nhalves don\u2019t clash but rather complement each other. This is, in large part,\ndue to the character of Ged. Despite\nonly being the main protagonist in\nthe \ufb01rst novel alone he is present in a\nmajor role in all of the books. We get\nto follow him from infancy to old age\nfrom the di\ufb00erent points of view of all\nthe other major characters. He serves\nas a focus and centre for the story as\nwell as being a compelling character\nin his own right.\nForget the epic plotlines of The Farthest Shore and The Other Wind, and\nthe powerful ideological musings of\nTehanu \u2014 the series is worth reading\nfor Ged\u2019s personal story alone.\nThe Earthsea books are a tue classic\nthat have inspired countless other authors and received numerous prizes\nand accolades. They are some of the\nbest books that I have ever read.\n\n"

    "content": "Balans-ed meal\nThe Balans menu is an eclectic mix of\ndishes from Thai to Italian and a wide\nvariety of cocktails. It is a caf\u00e9 style\nrestaurant, which specialises in cock-tails. If you can\u2019t agree where to eat\nout, then this is a great place for you\nas there\u2019s something for everyone on\nthe menu.\nIn hindsight the starters were the\nbest part of the meal; I really couldn\u2019t\nfault them. I generally believe in asking\nthe sta\ufb00 what they would recommend\nand they do know what\u2019s best when it\ncomes to the menu. Our waiter was\nreally helpful (and \ufb02irty may I add),\nand gave us some useful pointers.\nWe took his advice on sharing start-ers. We ordered the tru\ufb04ed chicken\nliver parfait with balsamic red onion\nmarmalade and sourdough toast; it\nwas fantastic. I love the combination\nof the meaty liver and the sweet onion\nmarmalade. I may have to learn how\nto make this in the near future. Liver is\nan acquired taste so I wouldn\u2019t order it\non a whim. Our second starter was the\nchicken potstickers with a sambal olek\ndip, which the waiter encouraged us to\norder \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 it was really\ndelicious. This is something anyone\ncould order, as (excluding vegetarians)\nwho doesn\u2019t like a chicken dumpling?\nBy this point the sauvignon blanc\nwas \ufb02owing (I\u2019m no wine bu\ufb00 but it\nwas tasty) and a live Jazz band started\nplaying. They were great and it did\nlure the punters in, maybe because of\nthe small surface area of the lead singer\u2019s skirt, or maybe because it created\nquite an atmosphere. If you like that\nkind of stu\ufb00 \u2013 live bands that is, not\nshort skirts \u2013 I heard that they have\na band on every Wednesday night.\nI should mention that it was pretty\nempty when we arrived, but that was\nprobably because it had just turned\n7pm and it was a weekday night. Nevertheless it never reached full capacity.\nMaybe the Soho branch (where Balans\noriginated) or others are busier earlier.\nOn to the mains: we had salmon \ufb01sh\ncakes, tuna steak and a side portion of\ngreen beans. My \ufb01shcakes were really\ngreat and well-seasoned. The chive\nbutter sauce complemented the \ufb01sh\nwell. It also came with a poached egg\non top, which I personally prefer more\ncooked, but it went well with the \ufb01sh.\nThere was a large amount of wilted\nspinach but in my opinion the more\nthe merrier when it comes to vegeta-bles. It was great to have something\nlighter with the rest of the main. The\ntuna steak came with a sauce of cherry\ntomatoes, capers, pine nuts, olives and\ngremolata. The tuna was well done\nbut I don\u2019t like capers so I\u2019d never order that dish (but I\u2019ll avoid having a\nrant about them). It de\ufb01nitely needed\nsomething on the side so the green\nbeans were an essential addition; they\nwere perfectly cooked and had a nice\nseasoning. A sign of a good chef is one\nthat doesn\u2019t overcook their veggies. I\nwill mention that the waiter did advise us to order the Thai curry which\nis apparently their signature dish.\nI\u2019d had a curry the previous night so\nI wasn\u2019t in the mood for another but\nwhen someone next to me ordered it\nI instantly su\ufb00ered from severe food\nenvy. It looked and smelled amazing\nand it is also one of the cheaper items\n(only \u00a310.95) on the mains section of\nthe menu.\nBy this point I was stu\ufb00ed to the\nbrim. I didn\u2019t manage to \ufb01nish dessert.\nI don\u2019t know what possessed me to order the largest, sweetest thing I could,\nbut I ordered the bano\ufb03 sundae\nwhich came with a large helping of ice\ncream and crushed amaretti biscuits.\nThis was hard to enjoy as I was so full\nbut if you have a large sweet tooth/\nstomach you\u2019d enjoy it. We also ordered a lemon sorbet which was much\nlighter (note to self: order sorbet after\nmassive starter and main) and it was\ndelicious \u2013 it really freshened up the\npalate after a massive meal.\nAll in all the food is reasonably\npriced, and if you optimise the use of\nthe 2-4-1 deals they do on cocktails\nand the live music it would be a great\ndeal too. A main sets you back around\n\u00a314 but the burgers/ wraps/ salads set\nyou back a mere \u00a38-\u00a39. We didn\u2019t invest in cocktails but they did look im-pressive. I get the impression that Balans seems like a great place to order\nseveral items on the menu to share,\nhave a cocktail, and a natter. I\u2019m going\nto head to the Soho branch soon. All\nin all there was good food and good\ncompany: it\u2019s a thumbs up from me!\nBalans (Earls Court branch)\n239 Old Brompton Road, London,\nGreater London SW5 9HP\nMonday-Thursday, Sunday:\n7.30am-12am\nFriday / Saturday: 7.30am-1am\nSophia Goldberg Food Editor\nFOOD\nLa Famiglia\nIt doesn\u2019t seem quite right\nto say there\u2019s a dodgy part\non the King\u2019s Road.

The expats have been replaced by the sort of people that read Michael Winner\u2019s weekly tosh in the even toshier newspaper-cum-tabloid that\nhas become The Sunday Times (yes, Mr Murdoch, it may be a bit rich coming\nfrom a student newspaper). La Famiglia\u2019s website even quotes the chap in their\nreview section \u2013 but then, this is a website that also states \u201cLike a vintage wine,\nLa Famiglia simply improves with age\u201d and endlessly name drops \u201c[\u2026] the place\nhas attracted the likes of Bridget Bardot, Michael Caine, Peter Sellars and Princess Margaret.\u201d Sometimes there just isn\u2019t enough vomit in the world. Rustic\ncharm has been wretchedly replaced by urban vulgarity.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. The food is still first class, proper hearty Italian cuisine\nat its best. No messing about, just putting the best ingredients on a good-sized\ndish and plonking it on your table. But as I sat there, with a delicious vitello\ntonnato sitting in front of me, my mouth just could not fully appreciate the\nbrilliance of the meal. My ears were under siege (for an overly heavy parallel,\nimagine the Persian invasion of Greece at the battle of Marathon), the constant\nstream of profanities coming from an odious, fat Australian to my left (no, not\nyou Mr Murdoch, you\u2019re skinny) just too much to handle. And to my right, two\nlate comers joined an already overly crammed table and gleefully wedged their\nchairs closer and closer to mine. My friend and I didn\u2019t have the strength or\nresilience the Greeks showed in 490 BC \u2013 we simply finished our main course,\ngot the bill, and vowed to never return to this offence on what should have\nbeen a really cracking dinner.\nOne Berry Nice Pie in the Sky\nBerry Pie\n(Modi\ufb01edrecipefromChloe\u2019sKitchen)\nThe crust\n2.5 cups plain \ufb02our\n1 tbsp sugar\n1 tsp salt\n1 cup cold margarine cut in small\ncubes 1\u20442 cup ice cold water\nThe \ufb01lling\n4 cups berries\n1\u20444 cup plain \ufb02our\n1 tsp cinnamon\n1\u20442 cup sugar\nMilk for brushing\nSugar for sprinkling\nProcedure:\nPreheat the oven at 180\u00b0C.\nLightly grease a 9-inch pie pan.

    "content": "21 million adult\ncod left in the\nNorth Sea\nFishing for the facts\nThere\u2019s plenty more fish in the sea \u2013 or are there?\nnly 100 adult cod in\nNorth Sea\u2019; \u2018Just 100\ncod left in North\nSea\u2019; \u2018Just 100 mature \ufb01sh in North\nSea\u2019 are but three of the headlines\npublished by The Sunday Times, The\nTelegraph Online, and The Sun re-spectively, a little over two weeks ago.\nOne is not required to be a \ufb01sherman\nor marine conservationist to stop and\nquestion such bold headlines, variations of which have been bandied\nabout by several American and Canadian news outlets. Whilst the population of Northern White Rhinoceri\ncan be written with a single digit, are\nNorth Sea cod really on the brink of\nextinction? How did these newspapers come up with such a \ufb01gure \u2013 and\nwas there any truth behind their extraordinary claims?\nThe newspapers were in fact technically correct. The issue stemmed\nfrom a misunderstanding by journalists over data. In the case of The Sunday Times, this data came from the\nInternational Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), before journalists turned to the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture\nScience (Cefas) for additional advice.\nThe Sunday Times deemed an \u2018adult\ncod\u2019 to be thirteen years of age, due\nto the fact that most North Sea cod\ncould apparently live up to twenty\ufb01ve years. Thus, it was logically assumed that a thirteen year-old cod\nwould be roughly half-way through\nits life. Using this gauge the data\nbacked up their headline: by looking\nat the data and how many cod over\nthirteen years of age had been caught\nover the year, it was estimated that\naround 100 \u2018adult\u2019 cod remained.\nWorrying? Hardly.\nFor North Sea cod thirteen years of\nage is old. Very old. To use a crude\ncomparison, it would be similar to\nclaiming the human adult population\nwas approximately 500,000, basing\nthe de\ufb01nition of \u2018adult\u2019 as someone\nbeing over 100 years of age. In fact,\nNorth Sea cod are sexually mature at\nsix years old \u2013 the point they could\nreasonably be called adults, several\nyears o\ufb00 thirteen. So where did the\ntwenty-\ufb01ve year lifespan \ufb01gure come\nfrom?\nThe estimate was taken from \ufb01shbase.org. And, indeed, cod have been\nestimated to live for up to twenty\ufb01ve years \u2013 in the Barents Sea, north\nof Norway and Russia, that is. For\nNorth Sea cod life expectancy is less\nthan half that, at an estimated eleven\nyears.\nGiven the relevant information, The\nSunday Times headline could be corrected with a simple number change:\n\u2018Only 21 million adult cod in the\nNorth Sea\u2019 would be a more accurate,\nif not thoroughly unspectacular, representation of the data. Whilst it is\nclear that over\ufb01shing is an issue to be\naddressed, the problem is not as dire\nas the overly simplistic Sunday Times\nheadline made it out to be, and the\npaper has since made amends. Unfortunately the story has since spread\nand helped perpetrate the myth that\nover\ufb01shing has caused cod stocks to\ncrash most spectacularly.\nIn this case the poor handling of\ndata spawned a story so startling that\nit was almost impossible to avoid further scrutiny, resulting in the exposure of inadequate investigative jour-nalism. But not all stories are so bold\nin their assertions that it\u2019s obvious\nmistakes have been made along the\nline. It\u2019s strongly encouraged regular\nreaders of scienti\ufb01c news take everything with a pinch of salt, and question what you read, a trait that will\nset you in good stead for the future.\nAfter all, \u2018The 100 cod\u2019 \ufb01asco isn\u2019t the\nworld\u2019s \ufb01rst piece of poor scienti\ufb01c\njournalism, and it certainly won\u2019t be\nthe last.\n\u2018\nO\nNational papers would have you think these\ncould soon be a rarity, but not is all as it seems...\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\n16\nLaurence Pope Science Editor\n\u201c\n... a story so\nstartling that\nit was almost\nimpossible to\navoid further\nscrutiny ...\nrther\nrther\n...\n...\nLove Science?\n(Of course you DON\u2019T, you study at Imperial College...)\nWhy not write for us?

Its\nlike \u201cJim\u2019s dad dresses up as Elvis, hilarious\u201d; but I feel like Jim. Whilst some\npeople find him hilarious and willingly\nvote for him, I think: \u201cOh God, I have to\nput up with this on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\nI can\u2019t even escape him when I go home\nto Norway: damned Olympics. And\nthen he started dancing at the closing\nceremony: that drunk-middle-aged-dad-at-a-wedding-dance (not for the\nfaint of heart).\nThat I was never a fan of him or Conservatism in the first place probably\ndoesn\u2019t help, but I was quite detached\nfrom him until I started at Imperial in\n2010, thinking of him as more of an idiot\nwho I could ignore completely. From\nthen on, as I increasingly identified London as somewhere I lived rather than\njust a place where I studied, I came to\nrealise just how much of a buffoon he\nwas (or was pretending to be), and just\nhow much he was getting on my nerves.\nIt increasingly becomes a case of\nother people finding him hilarious, and\nit infuriates me like it would Jim. It reminds me (Jim) of just how darned annoying he is, and just how annoying it is\nto have to constantly put up with him,\nnot being able to go a day without being reminded of why I didn\u2019t vote for\nhim (Jim wishing before going to sleep\nevery night that he had a normal dad).\nAll the other kids find Jim\u2019s dad\u2019s eccentricity hilarious, which infuriates him\nJack Hewitt\norgive me, reader, if you\u2019ve\nreached Olympic saturation point over the sum-mer. No doubt I would have\ndone so long ago, had I not\nspent a large part of those two weeks\nin a lecture theatre in The Netherlands. Utrecht train station, I excitedly discovered, had a large screen TV\nshowing the Games. I stationed myself\nin front of the screen, keen to catch up\non all the action\u2026\nBut wait. Horses? Music? Horses\ndancing to music? \u201cIs this some kind\nof hoax?\u201d I asked the lady who was sat\nnext to me. However she reassured\nme that this was indeed \u201cdressage\u201c, an\nOlympic sport. Perplexed, I continued\nwatching. Dressage undoubtedly requires a certain amount of skill (from\nboth rider and horse), but is no spectator sport. Each act looked the same\nto me (yet bewilderingly collected different scores). And each rider looked\nthe same on horseback (indeed it was\nonly after a while that I noticed that\nsome were male and some were fe-male).\nThe event that followed was something called \u201cBMX\u201d which, I should\nexplain to those who have yet to have\nthe dubious pleasure of watching it,\ninvolves riding very small bikes over\narti\ufb01cial hills. Despite it being easy\nenough to work out who is winning,\nthere is still not much that BMX has\nto o\ufb00er to the non-bloodthirsty spec-tator; it is fairly common for only a\nhandful of the competitors to complete the race, the rest su\ufb00ering painful injury on the way.\nCall me old fashioned, but I yearned\nfor a good old running or jumping\ncontest. However, my prayers went\nunanswered, as we migrated from\nBMX to women\u2019s boxing. A British\nlady was in the \ufb01nal and so patriotism\ndictated that I willed her to punch her\nopponent in the face as hard as pos-sible. Extraordinary. I don\u2019t call that\nsport.\nSo what sport should be in the\nOlympics instead? Certainly there\nare many worthy contenders, but the\none that springs to my mind is squash.\nAlthough excluded now and in 2016,\nit surely has more appeal to both the\nplayer and the spectator.

    "content": "Kate Winslet - Titanic EGO\nFILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\n36\nFelix Film wishes a warm and happy birthday to England\u2019s very own Kate Winslet, celebrating her\n37th birthday today; and as a special thank you to one of the most talented actresses of our time, we\nlook back at the highlights in the extraordinarily diverse career of a supremely gifted English ac-tress, and what to expect in the future.\nPowerful debut: Heavenly Creatures\n(1994):\nAfter bit parts in British television, Winslet made her \ufb01lm debut in Peter Jackson\u2019s dark and stylishly gripping Heavenly Creatures. She received wide critical\nacclaim in her \ufb01rst motion picture ap-pearance, and won several awards (in-cluding the Empire Award and London\nFilm Critics Circle Award for Best Actress), putting her \ufb01rmly in place within\nthe \ufb01lm industry.\nWider recognition and UK success: Sense\nand Sensibility (1995), Jude (1996), Hamlet (1996):\nShe landed further supporting roles in UK\ufb01nanced \ufb01lms, portraying Marianne Dashwood in Ang Lee\u2019s Oscar-winning adaptation of Jane Austen\u2019s Sense and Sensibility for\nwhich she was nominated for her \ufb01rst Academy Award and won her \ufb01rst BAFTA and Screen\nActors Guild Award aged 21 at the time,\nMichael Winterbottom\u2019s Jude and Kenneth Branagh\u2019s all-star Shakespeare\nvehicle Hamlet.\nInternational breakthrough: Titanic\n(1997):\nAfter a long, tough auditioning pro-cess, Winslet \ufb01nally landed the part of\nRose in James Cameron\u2019s Titanic. Little\ndid she, or anyone, know at that stage\nthat Cameron\u2019s disaster \ufb01lm would become the global movie event. The \ufb01lming\nprocess was not an easy one, with harsh\nworking conditions and Cameron\u2019s perfectionist attitude making for some\nchallenging events. But once the \ufb01lm\n\ufb01nally did open, it went on to exceed\neveryone\u2019s wildest expectations, and\nWinslet\u2019s name and face were all over\nthe world. She received her second\nAcademy Award nomination here.\nReturn to independent cinema:\nHoly Smoke! (1999), Quills\n(2000), Enigma (2001), Iris\n(2001):\nDespite the unprecedented success of Titanic, and despite being\noffered many lucrative roles in\nbig-budget studio pictures, Winslet turned them all down and\nretreated to independent \ufb01lms.\nPaired up with Australian director Jane Campion, she completed\nHoly Smoke! a quirky, intriguing travelogue which won both\nCampion and Winslet the Elvira\nNotari Prize at the 1999 Venice\nFilm Festival. She starred in a\nperiod piece opposite Geoffrey Rush as a chambermaid\nto the Marquis de Sade in\na mental institution in\nQuills. Her \ufb01rst war \ufb01lm\nwas in Enigma directed\nby Michael Apted, and her t h ir d\nAcademy Award nomination came from\nIris, playing the late British author and philosopher Dame Iris Murdoch.\nFurther success: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n(2004), Finding Neverland (2004), Little Children\n(2006):\nDeparting from her usual roles, she appeared with Jim Carrey in the weirdly brilliant, neurotic, and baffling Eternal\nSunshine of the Spotless Mind penned by Charlie Kaufman,\nwhich earned her the fourth Academy Award nomination.\nRounding off 2004 was Finding Neverland, a semi-biograph-ical retelling of J. M. Barrie\u2019s relationship with Sylvia\nLlewelyn Davies (Winslet) whose sons inspired\nhim to write Peter Pan. After scoring another\nAcademy Award nomination as a deluded adulteress in Little Children, she\nset the record of becoming the\nyoungest actor to garner \ufb01ve\nnominations.\nIn comes the much-deserved Oscar: The\nReader (2008), Revolutionary Road (2008):\n2008 saw Winslet starring in some\nreal award-worthy, showy productions\nthat were sure to score her some wins after\na long streak of losing at the Oscars. It was just a\nmatter of choosing between her two outstanding performances in The Reader, in which\nshe played an ex-Nazi officer with a shameful secret, and in Revolutionary Road, which\nreunited her with DiCaprio 11 years after the\nsinking ship, playing a married couple on the\nbrink of a dangerous relationship meltdown.\nShe triumphed with the former, winning her\nmuch-deserved golden statuette.\nLater roles and an Emmy win: Contagion (2011), Carnage (2011), Mildred\nPierce (2011):\nWinslet had two \ufb01lms premiere at\nthe 2011 Venice Film Festival, both of\nwhich were well received. Contagion,\nan ensemble piece chronicling the\nspread and reaction to a deadly virus\noutbreak, has been described as a\n\u201ctense, tightly plotted and smart\u201d\nthriller. Carnage, Roman Polanski\u2019s\nadaptation of the darkly comic play\nalso won her rave reviews, earning\nthe entire ensemble a handful of\nawards. Her big award victory\nafter the Oscars came after she\nlanded the titular role in HBO\u2019s\nadaptation of Mildred Pierce,\nas a struggling single mother\nbringing up her two daughters during the Great Depression. She scooped\nup essentially every single\nBest Actress in a Mini-Series\nAward out there, including the\ntop prize, the Emmy.\nUpcoming roles: Movie 43 (2013),\nLabor Day (2013), The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\n(2013):\nIf everything goes according to plan,\nthree of Winslet\u2019s \ufb01lms will be released in\n2013. Movie 43 will be an ensemble comedy piece of several intertwining tales;\nwith Labor Day she unknowingly helps\nan escaped convict; and The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\n(goodlucktothis\ufb01lm\u2019sadvertisingteam)\nwill reunite her and director Kenneth\nBranagh for the \ufb01rst time since Hamlet,\nin which she is reportedly playing an\nauthor in post World War II Guernsey\nIsland writing a book about the Island\u2019s\nresidents\u2019 experiences during the war.\n\n"

The phone\nexpected for release last year \ufb01nally\nmade its debut at the September 12th\nApple conference, and although opening weekend sales topped 5 million\nand they sold twice as many iPhones\nas last year in the \ufb01rst 24 hours, it really wasn\u2019t the smooth launch Apple\nwould\u2019ve wanted.\nIt\u2019s reported that 30-40% of all brand\nnew iPhones are arriving to the high\npaying customers scu\ufb00ed in the box,\nknown as \u201cscu\ufb00gate,\u201d and iOS6 Apple Maps made news worldwide with\nlevels of fail not seen since the Sega\nDreamcast. Include this with bloggers\nand users around the world complaining about \u201cletterboxing\u201d, where two\nblack strips appear on the top and bottom sides of the iPhone, and it doesn\u2019t\nsound good.\nAdd the standard trolling we\u2019ve\ncome to expect from the other smartphone makers, and it\u2019s not great. Samsung poked fun with a new \u201cthe next\nbig thing is already here\u201d video, which\nquotes Apple users saying \u201cwe\u2019re \ufb01nally getting everything we should\u2019ve got\nlast year,\u201d and an ex-Apple user holding a space in line for the phone for his\nelderly parents. Similarly a Google ad\nfor the Motorola RAZR Droid shows\nApple maps vs Google maps with the\ncaption #iLost.\nTheiPhone5wasn\u2019tthebest,smooth,\nor even a grand launch we all expect of\nApple, but neither was the iPhone 4S;\nmaybe the company is struggling more\nthan we thought without all-round\nlegend Steve Jobs at the helm.\nOr perhaps I\u2019m being unfair and focusing on the negatives too much. Ignoring the bad press, the iPhone 5 is\nactally an amazing phone. Apple have\nsuccessfully managed to exceed nearly\nall projected pre-order \ufb01gures and the\nsales clearly show the company is doing something very well. The new iPhone 5 o\ufb00ers a great 4-inch 16:9 screen\nwith an impressive 326ppi (pixel per\ninch) retina display. It\u2019s best feature\nthough, in this editor\u2019s opinion, is its\nweight. At just 112g it\u2019s an impressive\n73g lighter than the Lumia 920 and 21g\nlighter than the SG3. With the iPhones\nnew hardware and software update it\nhas also, of course, gotten a LOT fast-er. It\u2019s now caught up with the speeds\npreviously seen in the Lumia 800 and\nsurpassed them.\nBut the iPhone 5 lacks NFC (con-tactless), which is odd of Apple to keep\nout, seeing as the Lumia 920 and GS3\nboth have it and the GS3 has a trump\non both with external storage. The iPhone\u2019s precious retina display isn\u2019t actually a winner either, it may beat the\nSG3 4.8-inch 306ppi screen, but the\nLumia 920 packs what it calls PureMotion HD+. It\u2019s a 4.5-inch screen that\npacks 331ppi, and apparently its pixels can move twice as fast as all other\nscreens, making it look super smooth.\nThe Lumia is also the only smartphone\nthat packs Wireless Charging, as well\nas its long awaited PureView camera\ntechnology featuring unbeatable SLResque image stabilisation and night\ntime photography.\nAll three phones however are 4G\nLTE enabled, ready for the super network of Orange & T-Mobile, Everything Everywheres launch later this\nmonth.\nOverall, all three of these phones\nhave excellent hardware, but the one\nthing that really seperates them is the\nOperating System.\nThere\u2019s no outright winner in this\nthough, it all depends on what you\nwant out of your phone.\nThe easiest, fastest and simplest to\nuse and understand has to be, bizarre-ly, Windows Phone. However, it has\nserious limitations due to the lack of\napps and its current market share. The\ngood news is that time is de\ufb01nitely on\nWindows\u2019 side, especially with the imminent launch of Windows 8 and free\nprogramming software.\niOS has the largest app store in the\nworld and is probably has the most\nrecognised interface around as well as\nbeing quite fast.\nAndroid lets you be creative and customise to your heart\u2019s content, perfect\nfor the all tech lovers/hackers.\nLaugh out loud*\nat people who upgraded their phones before uni\nJason Parmar Technology Editor\nFRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\nAdd me on MySpace?\nAfter launching in 2003, MySpace was guilty of taking many of our social networking virginies by taking advantage of us being embarrassing teenagers\nwhile we posed, pouting in front of mirrors with a 1MP camera phone.\nBut then we grew up and most of us realised that editing our profile HTML to\nmake people who viewed our profile see our \u201ccreativite personality\u201d was super\nlame, so we moved onto university-based Facebook.\nMySpace continued to grow for a few years after Rupert Murdoch (that old\ndude who owns all the world\u2019s media) purchased it for $580million as it became \u201cthe most visited website in the US\u201d, beating Google, in 2006. But from\n2008 onwards the site went into an impressively steep decline, with most of us\nretrospectively deleting our accounts (or wishing we could but we\u2019ve forgot\nthe password for our cringe e-mail \u201chot_sexy_jasonp_1991@hotmail.com\u201d).\nBut, last week the cooler of the two Justins, Justin Timberlake, tweeted a link\nto a video from the former social networking powerhouse entitled \u201cnew MySpace\u201d. JT appears to be the front man for the launch of the new Metro-style\n\u201credesigned entirely from scratch\u201d social network, and it makes sense as he has\nan ownership stake in the company.\nAfter watching it, it does look significantly cooler and better than Facebook\nor Google+, and follows a design that is perfectly suited for a Windows 8 app.\nI\u2019m kind of looking forward to it.\nBut, whatever happens, I can\u2019t wait for Bebo\ntogetarevamp.Thecouplewhocreateditwent\nto Imperial, met in the then Southside bar, and\ngot married before selling it for $850m.

To date we have\nfound no evidence that these patients\nhave come to clinical harm as a result\nof our poor record keeping. 18 patients have been re-referred. All have\nbeen seen, and none have been found\nto have cancer.\u201d While 74 of those affected have since died statement from\nthe Trust said that \u201can independent\nclinical review group has found that\nthere is no correlation between the\nreason for death and this data reporting issue\u201d.\nEven though the problem came to\nlight in January e\ufb00orts to contact affected patients through the GPs who\nreferred them to hospital were not\nbegun until May; a delay the Trust defended as necessary to investigate the\nfull extent of the data loss. There has,\nhowever, been widespread criticism\nof the distress caused to vulnerable\npatients. Katherine Murphy, Chief\nExecutive of the Patients Association,\nsaid that the situation was \u201cunacceptable for any patient who has had any\ninvestigation, but especially patients\nawaiting cancer results, where every\nday counts\u201d.\nThe issue was judged to be so serious that Westminster, Hammersmith\n& Fulham and Kensington & Chelsea\ncouncils sent a joint letter to Sir Richard Sykes, the Chair of the Imperial\nCollege Healthcare, expressing their\n\u201csigni\ufb01cant misgivings about [the\nTrust\u2019s] management and governance\u201d.

My\nparents had driven down\nto Cornwall and had taken the bags o\ufb00 our bikes;\nafter two weeks, we \ufb01nally had a support car. With the weight\nremoved from my beleaguered back\nwheel, the tandem was a dream. I sped\nup the hills, my now mutant thighs\nmaking short work of the climbs, and\nthen \ufb02ew down the other side, enjoying gears I hadn\u2019t realised existed be-fore. The Claud Butler racing tandem,\nthe \u201cMajestic Two\u201d, was \ufb01nally getting\nto spread its wings. The sun was out,\nand King Arthur (the skeleton) was\ngetting to feel the wind in his\u2026 chest\ncavity. We arrived at Land\u2019s End in no\ntime.\nMost days weren\u2019t like that. No sir,\nmost days weren\u2019t like that at all.\nIt all started at some point in\nSeptember or October last year. I\nwas derping around on the Internet,\nwhen I stumbled upon a site called\n\u2018RecordSetter\u2019. It\u2019s kind of like a\ncrowd-sourced Guinness Book of\nRecords. You choose your record, you\nrecord yourself doing it, and if the\nRecordSetter community decides that\nit\u2019s legit: hey presto, you\u2019re a world\nrecord holder.\nI was impressed. I tweeted something obnoxious at them, like \u201cZOMG\nawesome website bro!\u201d They replied\nsuggesting that I try to set a record.\nThey suggested trying to break one\nof their cycling records. I found one,\nset in 1987 by an American called Art\nHo\ufb00man. He had cycled 437 miles on\na tandem with a skeleton on the back\nto raise awareness about the dangers of smoking. \u201cI could beat that,\u201d\nI thought, and thus started down a\npath that would lead to me standing\non Dartmoor in the middle of a storm,\nstaring down a great big horned cow,\nwith a tandem and skeleton in tow.\nMy preparations for the cycle were\nabysmal. Pretty much the only useful thing I did was persuade Sioni, an\nexperienced cyclist, to come with me.\nPeople would ask me, \u201cHow\u2019s training going?\u201d and I would laugh, say\n\u201cErrr, not bad\u201d and then make a mental note to lie more convincingly next\ntime. Before setting o\ufb00 on the trip, I\nhad been on the tandem fewer than\nten times. And no more than three of\nthose times were with the skeleton. I\nhad never in my life cycled more than\n50 km in one day. Simply put, I had no\nidea if the bikes, the skeleton, or my\nbody would last the entire journey, or\nmake it in the time we allotted.\nI quickly discovered that the bike\nwas much too small for me; that the\nhandlebars were atrociously uncom-fortable; and that even a Brooks saddle will do horrendous things to your\nbackside if you haven\u2019t broken it in.\nThere wasn\u2019t really a point, you\nsee, where I had made a conscious\ndecision to do this cycle. I thought\nit would be cool to break a record; I\nthought it would be fun to cycle John\nO\u2019Groats to Land\u2019s End; it felt right to\nraise money for Imperial scholarships,\nto help other people have the opportunity to attend the university that had\ngiven me so much. But to be honest,\nwhen I found myself in possession of\na borrowed skeleton and a tandem, I\nthought, \u201cOh dear, I\u2019m actually going\nto have to do this now\u201d \u2013 it felt churlish at that point to turn back.\nAnd boy were there a lot of times\nwhen I wanted to turn back, to stop,\nto sack it all in. The two hazy, fevera\ufb04icted days in and around Herefordshire; when Arthur snapped at the\nspine and I had to carry him on my\nback for 30 miles; every time I went up\na hill; every time I came down a valley\nand understood that, like a Lannister,\nI would have pay that debt back on the\nother side. And, of course, I wanted to\nturn back when I encountered cow-zilla on Dartmoor.\nIt probably wasn\u2019t a good idea to try\nand cycle across Dartmoor. I mean,\nnothing about cycling the entire length\nof the UK with your mate\u2019s skeleton on\na tandem from the 80s is a good idea.\nBut cycling across Dartmoor in particular was a dreadful idea.\nThe rain wasn\u2019t falling from the\nsky. It was shooting across the moor\ninto my face as if some great big \ufb01reman was spraying his hose across the\nlandscape (eww). The wind wasn\u2019t\njust blowing, it was straight up sucker\npunching me in the gut when I least\nexpected it. The hills weren\u2019t just\u2026 ok,\nyou get the idea.\nBut whilst I could deal with being\nso soaked that I had abandoned the\nthought that I might ever be dry again,\nI couldn\u2019t deal with a great big cow\nsuddenly appearing out of the fog in\nthe middle of the road. Sioni was far\nahead in the distance; the two deaf cyclists we had passed earlier were surely far behind; and here I was alone,\nT\nLIKE A BAWWS\n\u201cMeh,\nthere are\nprobably\nless\ninteresting\nways to\ndie\u201d\n8 FRIDAY 5 OCTOBER\n\n"

However, it is an even better place to get some cheap after-college pizza and\nhang out with friends. With a mega chilled out\nvibe and lots more on offer than just pizza (quiche\n\u2013 which is amazing and comes with a salad that has\na dressing that must contain addictive drugs, salads, cakes, pasta\ndishes, and loads more) Caffe Forum rates highly on our cool scale. (You\nalso get a free croissant if you buy a coffee in the morning... or a free coffee\nif you buy a croissant... something like that. We research well) The mochas\nalso deserve special praise for being outstanding.\nThis place is niiiiiiice. And as expected, some plates\ncome at a price. However, we\u2019ve found a way to enjoy the 5* environment without having to max out\nyour overdraft. Go here for a pot of tea and chips.\nChips are \u00a32.95 and you get a big wooden bowl full.\nThey\u2019re proper thin fries, and are really great with\nmeals. This sounds odd, but the reason that we\neven tried this place was that we always see loads\nof people with amazing looking platefulls of chips. It took some courage\n(and a long day of work, and therefore lowered regard for our bank bal-ances) to go in and try it. Amazingly, tea is \u00a31.95 for a pot \u2013 cheaper than\nStarbucks. If you\u2019ve got a spare afternoon and want a change of scenery,\nwe highly recommend that you hang out here for a bit. The three egg omelettes are worth a try. That, chips, and tea is a pretty boss dinner.\nThis is on that row of shops that includes a few cafes. It\u2019s another one of\nthose places that you just walk past everyday and think \u201cI\u2019ll definitely go to\nthat at some point, probably\u201d, then, inevitably, you don\u2019t bother to actually\ngo in the end.\nHere\u2019s the part that will make you think \u201cnah, can\u2019t be arsed\u201d: it\u2019s a little\nbit pricey. However, it is really worth it. They do these open faced sandwich\nthings, called \u201ctartines\u201d apparently (yes, we are a bit uncultured and so had\nto look that up). The roasted vegetable one is particularly nice. The grilled\ngoat\u2019s cheese and roasted vegetable toasted tartine (we feel very sophisticated saying this as if we knew it all along) is really great. Maybe that\u2019s because I (Tim) have an almost perverse love of\ngoat\u2019s cheese, or it could be the great salad\ndressing that they give you. We know that\nwe\u2019ve been banging on about salad dressing way too much in this article, but, hon-estly, salad is just leaves and shit without the\ndressing: in other words, it\u2019s the dressing that\nmakes it.\nThe atmosphere, well, put it this way: it\u2019s very much\nsomewhere you can sit in and forget all about\nquantum mechanics in. We recently found\nout, with a pang of horror, that this is actually\na chain, but oh well, it\u2019s still worth it.\nOther mentions go to: Caf\u00e9 Nero on Gloucester road, for the comfiest sofas in town.
