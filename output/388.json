There was no FELIX on\nWednesday for the simple reason that our main priority\nthis week has been to finish the printing of PHOENIX,\nthe ICU arts magazine'. If we do not get it done in the\nvery near future, then its actual publication will be\nseriously at risk. Hopefully, the hard grind that has\nbeen done in the past few days will bear fruit with the\navailability of PHOENIX within the next two weeks.\n*\nI was rather puzzled, nay displeased, by the\nappearance of a memo from the College Registry to\nself-supporting students (including overseas students)\nproclaiming the increase of \u00a370 in the session al fees.\nI understand that THIS INCREASE HAS NOT YET BEEN APPROVED BY THE GOVERNING BODY hence\nthe memo is being bl an tant ly presumptuous.\nAs regards the fee increase itself the Overseas\nStudents Committee is planning action in the form of a petition and possibly a picket of the Governing Body\nmeeting on May 23rd. Anyone interested should contact\nChris Kourouniotis in the Maths Department.\n*\nWhere has all the controversy gone? Has everyone\nfallen into a dull stupor due to impending exams?\nWhere are all the literary giants who once d graced the\nFELIX letters column with their pearls of wisdom? And\nwho is Nigel Reditt anyway?\nCatherine Gill Pause for thought.\nALTHOUGH I hate to begin on the discordant note of criticising FELIX, I feel I must point out to the general public (?) that contrary\nto what they may have been told, I am not Boadsheet Editor, but\nsomething quite different, yes you've guessed the obvious mistake...\nI am in fact the IF Broadsheet Editor. Being Broadsheet Editor\nmeans that it falls to my unhappy\nlot to entice works of literary\ntalent from the already overworked students at IF. This gets\nincreasingly difficult as the\nlonger you have been here in\nFrench South Kensington, the\nmore difficult it is to remember\nhow to write and even express\noneself in English! I hope\ntherefore that you will excuse\nany grammatical errors.\nHowever, let us press on to\nmore interesting things. How\nwould you like to be introduced\nto yet another member of IF\nUnion who was, unfortunately\nomitted from that exhilarating\nand inspiring article written by\nour illustrious President. May I introduce Lise Bratton, our\nAccommodation Secretary. Many\nof you might say, not only have\nI no idea who Lise Bratton is, I haven'ta clue who any of the\nother members of IF Union are\neither. The remedy, gentlemen,\nis in your own hands, get\nyourselves over here to IF and\nvisit us in the Union Room. It's always a pleasure to see new\nfaces. However, it may have to\nbe a lightning visit as due to\nthe mountain of work we are\nrequired to get through, we are\nlimited to only half an hour for\nlunch. You may be sure that\nthis invitation has the blessing\nof 'mon capita in e' who keeps us\nall in order.\nAnd now I'd like to thank you\nall for watching my little show\nhere today, if you've enjoyed it\n...don't miss next week's exciting instalment.\nREVIEW: Dramsoc\nTHE IMPERIAL COLLEGE entry in the 20th Sunday Times\nStudents' Drama Festival was an excellent production of Tom Stoppard's play 'Albert's Bridge!' The action moved very\nsmoothly among a number of simple sets on the large stage, with the rusty brown scaffolding of 'Albert's bridge as a constant\nbackdrop .Albert, a philosophy student turned bridge painter-poet\nwas finely portrayed by Eric Stove ll. He played the word-intoxicated Stoppard character with precision and a fine sense of\nthe poetic pseudo-vision of this brilliantly-conceived character.\nThe blundering city off ici als who hired Albert to paint the vast\nbridge single-handedly were vividly depicted, and the rapid-fine\nStoppard give and take of their committee sessions was handled\nin an exhilarating fashion. Of particular note were John Woodfin\nas the committee chairman, and Zig gi Kronbergs as Fitch, the\nflustered, efficiency-obsessed accountant. Mike Stanger and\nKaren Will is were very good as his successful father and success oriented mother. The final scene, in which an army of painters\napproach the bridge, was marked by very fine sound effects; and\nStoppard's vision of a world so crowded that people can only\nmove upwards into the higher reaches of 'Albert's' bridge is\nbrilliantly conveyed.\nWANTED\nA Publicity Officer.

    "content": "4 FILIX\nc ROSS COUNTRY\nIC WIN THE IL A1 HLETIC CHAMPIONSHIP LAST SATURDAY, the University of London held its Athletic Championships at Motopur Park Athletic Ground. A strange place,\nyou may say, to see the Imperial College Cross-Country team, but\nthey get around you know. Anyway, the team and a few friends\nwere there at 11.00 am to see what could be done about Guy's Hospital, who had won the\ntrophy for the last ten years.\nThe day started slowly for\nthe IC CCC, mainly due to the\npreponderance of middle-distance runners in the team.\nThe first two events were the\nLong-Jump and the 100m heats.\nIn the long-jump, Pete Johnson\nand Dave Houlbrooke fought\nhard for last place and\nfinished 11th and 12th, packing\nwell at the rear.\nPete ran his next event at\nmarathon speed but since it\nwas the 100m he did not get a place in the final.\nIC's first points of the day\ncame from Kevin Brady, who\nran a fast 3000m steeplechase\nto finish second behind UL' st op runner, Martin Knapp.\nGaining more points for IC and\nholding off the opposition was\nIan Ellis who ran well, recovering from an appalling\nstart to finish fourth.\nIn the field events, the\nCross-Country team lacked\nstyle but made up for that by\ndetermination, the only two\nfield events we did not cover\nwere the hammer and the high\njump.\nThe next track event was\nthe 3000m walk in which we\nhad four entries. Rob All in sori, having neglected the sport for\na couple of years came back /\nwell to finish second, and Ian\nEllis\" fresh\" from his steeplechase sup rise d everyone,\nincluding himself by coming\nthird but he put.it down to\ntraining with R Ashley. Steve\nWebb walked into fifth place to\nkeep the other colleges down,\nand Pad Donnelly finished\nt welt h. In a hard 800m Rob All in son was fourth, but later in the\n5000m, he pulled out a superb\nrun to finish second behind\nAndy Crompton; Steve Webb\nfinished well coming sixth. The 400m hurdles gave IC\nits only victory of the day,\nDave West winning in fine\nstyle well ahead of the field,\nin the depths of which Ian Ellis finished fourth.\nRoy Rosser was the dark\nhorse of the IC team, nobody\nquite knowing his potential.\nAfter a fine run in the 400m, where he finished second, just\nbeating Dave West, he then\nproceeded to come second in\nthe triple jump.\nThe positions of the various\nteams were read out at intervals\nduring the afternoon and at\nabout three o' clock it became\nobvious to us that we were\nserious contenders for the\ntrophy.\nRealising that every point\nmattered at this stage, Pete Johnson and Ian Ellis were\nhurriedly conscripted to attempt\nthe pole vault, the only problem\nbeing neither of them had seen\na pole-vault pole in his life\nbefore,let alone used one. Pete\nand Ian had precisely three goes\neach to learn to pole vault and\nto clear a bar of six feet in\nheight. Pete started first with\na brave run, but as he stuck his\npole in, his hands slid down\nthe bar almost to knee height.\nHis second attempt comprised\nof a faster run up and a faster\nslide down the pole, and his\nthird attempt would have done\njustice to a sprinter, as he\nbreasted the bar, off the pegs. Ian lined up for his jumps, ran\nup, took off attained approximately 8 5 r and promptly fell\nsprawling on the grass on the\nsame side of the bar as he\ntook off. His second attempt\nsaw him clear of the bar but\nneglect to let go of the pole,\nand the third attempt saw him\nclear of the bar to gain IC at\nleast one point. By clearing\nthe next height, and failing at\nthe one after, Ian managed a commendable fifth behind such\npeople as the British Universities Sports champion (who\ncan jump nearly as high as Ian\npole-vaulted!)\nThe 1500m saw Steve Webb\nin action again along with\nHurrican Houlbrooke. The pace\nwas carved out from the begin n LUB LAB WINS\nTHE MARSHALL HAYS CUP LAST SATURDAY Hammersmith Amateurs opend the regatta\nseason on the Tideway. IC Novices also known as the Lub Lab Second Eight celebrated one year's rowing by winning the Marshal\nHays Challenge Cup. Our qualifying race early in the afternoon was rowed with the\nft f \u00bb\ns iii lil incoming tide up to Hammersmith Bridge . Rowing on the\ncentre station with the best of\nthe stream but the worst of the\nchoppy water to contend with, we drew away from Cygnet and\nNational Westminster at the\nstart. Then with Tony stroking\nat a rate which belied his\nstature we increased our lead\nat the finish to two lenght s, thanks to a good deal of bashing\nand not much technique.\nWe were on the water three\nhours later for the final by\nwhich time the tide had turned\nso the race was rowed downstream from Chiswick E yot. Again we had the centre\nstation with Latyner Upper\nSchoool on Surrey and Twi cken ham RC on Middlesex . Off the\nstart we were slightly down on\nboth crews, striding early to a solid 34 on the fourteenth\nstroke. Afte'r about twenty\nstrokes the other crews finished\ntheir starting burst and we\nbegan to drive through them,\nleading by three quarters of a length at two minutes. Latymer\nwho were striking well into the\nforties off the start, \" blew\" but the Twickenham crew held\non strongly and it took expert\nco xing by boatman Charlie\n(12 stone?) to keep them out of\nthe stream and out of luck. At\nthe finish we were still three-quarters of a length up which, having allowed half a length\nfor the curvature of the course\nleft a margin of about a canvas. Thanks to skilful coaching\nwe now,look forward to continued\nsuccess as a Senior C crew.

    "content": "Founded in 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION FREE! No. 388\nFRIDAY,9 TH MAY,1975.30 PER CENT RISE\nON BEER AND FOOD ?\nNew Mines Mascot\nTHE RS M Union meeting on\nMay l st saw the unveiling of\nthe new Mines mascot, presumably still called' Davy.' It stands over two feet high\nand rumour has it that it weighs\nover eighty pounds. Like the\nnew ' The t a,'RCS Union's mascot, it is 100% vi rg nal at\nthe moment.\nCuriously enough it is ten\nyears to the very month since\nthe old ' Davy' was first unveiled\nin 1965. Before that time, the\nR SMU mascot had been ' Guy' a Michelin rubber man who had\nbeen around since February\n1958.\nClearly, IC's mascots must\nnow be the envy of every other\nuniversity and college in the\ncountry.\n:\n0l% MORE ICU ELECTIONS THURSDAY LAST week\nsaw further ICU elections at\nthe U GM for posts on next\nyear's Union Council. The following were elected\nas floor Representatives: Bill Gerrard, Nick Payne, Ann Pickard, Ricky Graham, Paul Branthwaite, Steve Kim mins. Guy Rigby was elected to\nthe post of Student Residence Office and Sunil Mohindra was\nelected as the Chairman of the\nOverseas Students Committee.\nThere have still been no\nnominations for the posts of\nWelfare Officer and Academic Affairs Officer. THE REFECTORY Committee meeting of May 1st was\ndominated by the prospect of an enormous catering loss for\nthe year ending July 1975. The running loss was believed to\nbe \u00a339,000 at the end of March hence it is believed that the\nCollege will want refectory price increases of the order of\n20 \u2014 30% at the end of term.\nNo real argument took place\nsince detailed discussion has\nbeen put off until a specially convened extraordinary meeting\nof the committee next Friday( May 16th). Also to be discussed then are proposals from the\nCatering Manager, Mr Mooney,\nthat the prices of \"brought in\" goods such as meat pies, chicken pieces, yogurt etc\nshould be increased immediately\nbecause the profit margin has\nall but disappeared. lt is known\nthat IC Union reps on the\ncommittee will try to oppose\nmid session al increases, but\ntheir chances of success are\ndiminished by the enormity of\nthe catering loss. In recent years this catering\nloss has been covered by the\nsurplus on the bar and wine\ncellar accounts. It is understood that these are expected\nto be about \u00a310,000 and \u00a36,000 .\nThe shortfall this year is\nexpected to be about \u00a320,000\nand this will more than wipe\nout all reserves from previous\nyears put aside for necessary\nmaintenance and replacement\nof furniture and equipment.\nThe meeting ended with the\nCatering Manager requesting\nan interim increase of 20 on\nbeers. This was to cover the\nbudget increase of excise duty\nwhich the breweries have\npassed on to the College. It\nwas pointed out that, on top\nof this, breweries were\nincreasing prices by 1 \u2014 2p. David Sinclair, the student\nChairman of the Bar Committee,\nargued for not passing on any\nincrease at the moment simply\nbecause the sheer size of even\nthe interim suggestion would\nbe very difficult to cover on a student income. He is known\nto want to hold prices down\nuntil the end of term if possible. Short shrift was given to this\nidea by the committee but after\nheated argument and support\nfrom the ICU President, Trevor\nPhillips, Mr Sinclair proposed\ndoing nothing before the extraordinary meeting on May 16th with the rider that the Bar\nCommittee should meet in the\nmeantime to make recommend-at ions. This was accepted. The net result is that until\nMay 16th, prices have been\nfixed in the refectories and\nbars. Meanwhile, it is hoped\nby the Union that an announcement of the size of student\ngrants next year will have\nbeen made so that this can be\nused as a guideline for the\nsize of refectory price increases. Talking to FELIX David Sinclair admitted \"/'(/\nbe in for a sticky time at the\nBar Committee meeting on\nFriday (today infact \u2014 Ed.). It will take a miracle for there\nto be no increases this term y "

    "content": "FELIX Racial\nDiscrimination ?\nAN HILARIOUSLY SEXIST POINT OF VIEW\nFROM KARENGA DD IMAGINE\nHall places are allocated not on the male/female basis but on\na British/ Foreign basis. The percentage of places for foreign\nstudents is always too low to match the number of foreign students\nwho ought to be in hall. No-one protests; no-one minds; anyway\nBritish students need more looking after: t bey miss their Mothers.\nForeign students are trained to\nlook after themselves \u2014 of\ncourse lots of foreign students\ndo get attacked and raped (even\nmale foreign students? \u2014 Ed.)\nin London streets after dark.\nBut c 'est la vie it's always\nhappened.\nWell, one day representing\nthe foreign students, a terrifying\naggressive figure known round\nCollege as 'Lady Anne'\nprotests and gets the. % of\nplaces in halls for foreign\nstudents raised so that for once\nthey have more places than\nthey should .\nThe outcry is amazing. In a special surprise issue of\nFELIX \"Racial Discrimination\"\nis proclaimed and everyone is\nshocked, including members of\nthe Joint Committee against\nSexism and Fac is m. Protests\nare made all over College and\nthe rumour spreads that ' Lady Anne' has gone too far this\ntime. Of course it couldn't happen.\nWe are much too enlightened to\nbe so petty and small minded.\nWe all understand about Racial Discrimination and we all know\nit's a 'bad thing' - no-one in\ntheir right mind would complain\nthat there Is racial disc rim in ation against English students.\nCompared with what foreign\nstudents face it's laughable.\nBut with sexual disc rim in ation it's different. Of course\nthere's nothing wrong with it.\nIt's funny. Men have been\nsniggering at it for centuries\nand even women often see the\njoke. But now sexual disc rim i nation has taken on a new sinister form. \"DISCRIMINATION\nAGAINST MEN.\" Suddenly\nnobody sees the joke anymore.\nIt's a serious issue: the men at\nIC gather together in the bars\nto moan about how oppressed\nthey are.\nThe question is - where'\nwill it stop? If you're not careful,\nyou might find the knickers in\nthe Union Bar replaced by V' \u2014\nfronts \u2014 with their titillating' contrast colour elastic. The\npictures in FELIX might feature\nsomething like \"Mike \u2014 this\nhandsome hunk hails from\nChemistry\" etc. Perhaps even\nthe lewd sexist entertainments\noffered in College Revues will be threatened. There' ll be no\nend to it unless it's stopped.\nMen of IC unite, your position\nis threatened. Stick out those\npuny chests of yours and assert\nyour masculine rights. For who\nknows, if you let the women of\nthis college claim their basic\nrights, it might lead anywhere .\nBesides if you give them\nan inch they'll discover that\nthere isn't anymore.\nIF YOU are one of these astrological freaks with exams\ncoming up, watch out! You haven'ta chance \u2014 at least, not\nwith a partial eclipse of the Sun on Sunday morning. Yes, the\ndie is cast, and at 6.54 a.m. the Moon will begin its passage\nacross the solar disk first appearing as a small nick out of the\ntop right-hand side. By 7.19, as the eclipse reaches its midpoint the Sun will have taken on the appearence of a Luminous\nMooney (?) beefburger with a large bite out of it, so if you still crawling homewards at that time, don't worry \u2014 it's not.\nThose eager to observe the eclipse are not advised to use\ntelescopes or binoculars directly on the Sun \u2014 it tends to\ncause holes in the back of the head. Far safer and much more\nconvenient is to project an image from the eyepiece on to a sheet of paper. If you haven't got an optical instrument, don't look directly with the naked eye. Some old photographic negatives or colour slides that \" didn't come out\" are useful for\nbrief looks, but if you want to stare at it any length of time fill\na bucket with water and watch the reflection.\nBy8.18 the eclipse will be over and the Sun whole again.\nStudents are not reputed for early rising on Sunday mornings,\nbut weather permitting, this should be something worth getting\nup for.\nPRIZE CROSSWORD NO. 17\nACROSS\n6.A muddled representative will\nalmost accept this maxim.(7).\n7.
