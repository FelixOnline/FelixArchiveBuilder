This is the most exciting\nyear so far, with sixty new\nprofessional frames and more\nphotographers participating than\never before! The reception takes\nplace between 5.30pm and 8.30pm, while those who want to reflect on\nthe pictures at their leisure have the\nwhole of February to do so. It is\nheld in the Consort Gallery, the\nroom next door to the main dining\nhall in the Sherfield Building.\nSo what are we all about? Most\npeople take photographs, and most\nare diss a pointed with the results\nthey get, the perfect picture from\nthe imagination rarely ends up on\nthe print! There is a solution:\ndevelop the photographs yourself,\nand use more creative darkroom\nskills to enhance your pictures.\nThere are over seventy\nphotographers in the Society, so\nthere is a lot of advice and shared\nexperience to be had. The basics are\nquite easy to learn: some of the\npictures in the exhibition were taken\nby people who had only started in\nphotography this year!\nYou will see a large variety of\nindividual styles on show in the\nexhibition, almost all of which were\nprinted at the Society darkroom\n(mostly last week!) We can teach\nyou how to dev lop Black and White\nfilms cheaply and make prints from\nnegatives (colour and black and\nwhite), and from slides. We can\nalso teach toning of prints (sepia,\nselenium etc). The darkroom has\nstocks of film which we buy in\nbulk, so that you can develop your\nown style without breaking the\nbank!\nWe've also started a new venture:\nGuest Speakers. Last week the\nIlford young journalist of the year\n- Greg Williams - came to talk about\nhis life as a photojournalist. He is\nonly twenty, but has already\ntravelled to Burma, ex-Yugoslavia,\nZimbabwe, Mozambique and\nTanzania, with a trip to India\nplanned in the near future. His\nphotographs for Oxfam feature in\ntheir current advertising campaign,\nwhile he has also had his pictures\npublished in the Times,\nIndependant, Guardian, Telegraph\nand German magazines. Greg plans\nto make a return visit, and to come\nto the exhibition.\nSo come to the opening reception\non first February from 5.30 pm.\nTake your time over the pictures\nand have another look later in the\nweek. Some of the pictures have\ninstant appeal, while others take\ntime and thought. If you want to\nknow about joining the\nPhotographic Society and future\nevents, please drop a note in my\npigeonhole (MechEng Undergrad),\nor see us in the Southside Lounge\nat 1.00 pm on Tuesdays.\nw USBK s BBB& BSSfflM\nPage 10 Page 11\n\n"

Mr Holmes was refunded in full on 30\nOctober, with \u00a325 coming from\nUnion petty cash. Mr Holmes has\nresponsibility for petty cash.\n\u2022 Six payments each of \u00a330 were\nmad on various dates to Mr Holmes\nby Mr Tom Fisher of RAT Books.\nMr Holmes was responsible for\nreceiving these payments. Of the\n\u00a3180 paid by Mr Fisher, only \u00a390\nwas paid into Union funds. The\nremaining \u00a390 is un accounted for.\n\u2022 Mr Holmes used the Goldsmith\nStudents' Union credit card to pay\nP&O European Ferries the sum of\n\u00a3322.50. Mr Holmes has informed\nthe accountants that the money was\nused for a private trip to\nAmsterdam.\n\u2022 The Goldsmith Students' Union\ncredit card has also been used to\npurchase food from the Raffles\nWine Bar on three dates in\nSeptember, for the sums of \u00a328.20,\n\u00a323.10 and \u00a328.40. No receipts for\nthese purchases have been given to\nthe Union.\nSince the investigation by West\nand Company Chartered\nAccountants, Goldsmith Union\nofficers have uncovered further\noutstanding debts and financial\nirregularities on the part of Mr Holmes. Terry Murtagh, Goldsmith\nUnion President, confirmed that the\ntotal sum concerned is \u00a3983.25.\nMr Murtagh told the\nInvestigations Unit this week that\nthe embezzlement was discussed at\na Union General Meeting last\nThursday,a meeting which was\nadvised by lawyers from the\nNational Union of Students.

'We will now get\non with running our Union,' he\nsaid.\nFelix News Reporters\nOn Thursday 26th January, a five\nminute section of a pornographic\nprogramme was broadcast by the\nStudent Television Of Imperial\nCollege (STOIC). The programme\nwas seen on the television screens\nin Da Vinci's Bar in the Union\nBuilding.\nA press statement released to\nFelix the next day by Matthew\nBalchin, STOIC Chairman, said the\nincident was caused by 'the\naccidental routing of an off-air\nsatellite receiver to Da Vinci's Bar\nby a private individual'.\nAn eye-witness told Felix that the\nbroadcast depicted 'a girl in a tight\nbikini who removed her top and\nrubbed her breasts for about two\nminutes before slipping into a Jacuzzi'.\nThe eye-witness said that the\nbroadcast had lasted approximately\n5 minutes, and that there had been\nsome channel switching for most of\nthe evening.\nOn Wednesday night, Mr Hugh\nEland, Publications Board\nChairman, called the screening\n'deplorable'. Mr Eland added that\nhe would expect a committee level\nresignation from STOIC over the\ntransmission. 'I'm absolutely\nastounded that they managed to do\nthis again,' he told IC Radio.\nSTOIC representatives were\nunavailable for further comment.\nThe 'private individual' has not yet\nbeen named.\nCareers Info\nMilk Round closing date No 5 is\non Monday 1st February.

But since the state\npolice were mos dy composed of\npsychotic soldiers back from the\nVietnam war, there was little\nchance of a low death count.\nThis play is set in the house of\none such demented ex-soldier who\nis called upon, along with his\nneurotic Vietnam buddy, to sort out\nthe riot. You are taken on a journey\nas the situation develops and are\ngiven a good insight as to the mental\nstate of two these people, and how\nthe people around them are affected\nby their memories of the Vietnam\nwar.\nAll the cast are remarkably\nconvincing, especially Richard\nBrake as Mr. Seriously-Unbalanced\nand Sara Montague as the t arty, nymphomaniac al, slut ty, slow\nwitted wife of the soldier in whose\nhouse the play is set. The American\naccents are accurate, but thankfully\nweak enough not to make you wince\nevery time one of the cast has to\nspeak.\nP. Tentious\n\u2022 Grace Theatre\nKing Baby\nNot light entertainment, though\nsometimes entertaining, James\nRobson's play takes an intimate\npeek into the working of an alcohol\nrehabilitation centre. James King\n(Tom Georgeson), a self-made\nbusinessman, checks into the centre\nin what he claims is an attempt to\nsave his marriage. Under the\nchameleon style leadership of\nJimmy (Lalor Roddy)\u2014reformed\nalcoholic\u2014the slow process towards\nhealing is begun.\nThe play tries to examine the\ndebasing aspect of alcoholism in a somewhat detached manner. Yet,\ncertainly when Maxine (Sheila\nReid), one of the other residents,\ntells her story the audience is aware\nof the horror of the depth to which\nshe has lowered herself in the\npursuit of alcohol.\nThe humour is bittersweet being\nmore the result of nerves than true\nlaughter. The tension of the play is\nbuilt into a potential confrontation\nbetween Jimmy and King Baby, as\nour businessman has been\nchristened. For the duration of the\nplay we wait for King Baby's story.\nWhen it comes it is at first\ndisappointing as Robson seems to\nhave sacrificed plausibility to\nFreud's Oedipus Complex.\nHowever, Georgeson's performance makes this confession\nas poignant as the others drawing\nupon the universal experiences that\nare present. It is this that ensures\naudience attention and interest\ntogether with the horrifying idea 'it\ncould be me'.\nSJ. \u2022 The Pit, Barbican, EC2, Barbican/Morgate tubes. Box\nOffice 071-628 2295.

Far from just a banal\nbackdrop, Kathryn Stott triumphed\nover that lousy Steinway to become\nthe star of the evening.\nBeethoven's Sonata No 4 in C Op\n102 glittered with detail and wit\nfocused by Miss Stott's con-scienc io us accompany ment. There\nfollowed the highlight of the\nevening Shostakovich's Op 40 in D minor. The energy and excitement\ngenerated by Ma's crackling\naccuracy and Stott's verve and\nconfidence was extraordinary. At\ntheir best in the allegro movements,\nthis pair defined all that live music\nis about.\nSome Heifitz-Gershwin arrangements were not my cup of tea but\nwere excellently delivered. The\nDvorvak Op 75 allowed the duet to\nexplore a lyric quality which, to my\ntaste Ma does not really do justice.\nHis playing is dramatic, relaxed and\nincisive but the thin quality of the\nhigher notes and his essentially\ngritty tone becomes inadequate in\nsuch romantic works. The closing\nselection of De Falla Spanish songs\nwas a joy. Dancing and swooping,\nstomping and tripping piano and\ncello vied and entwined in the heady\nclimax of a stunning concert.\nSara.\n\u2022 Barbican Centre, EC2, Barbican/Moorgate tubes.

Small settlements\nof squatting red plastered buildings\nsat chameleon like in the buff plains\nof tundra and cacti. Our hotel was\nthe taller one of the only two in\ntown. We stored our bikes in the\nbar downstairs beneath aTV set\nshowing the Tokyo games. The\nroom upstairs was compact and airy\nand we dined on the roof that night\nunder a single moth shrouded lamp.\nIt took another three days and two\nuncomfortable nights on the open\nroad to reach Imilchil. Compared\nto what we had seen en route for the\nlast few days, it was positively a sprawling metropolis, with 15,000\npeople, large market places and\nboundless hotels and cafes. The\nbuilding we choose to stay in was\npleasant and cool and rested behind\na castle of mud and dung. There\nwas a French photographer there\nwho'd been capturing the faces of\nthe local people for over two years\nin timeless black and white\nmasterpieces. The little inn was run\nby a couple of young boys who\nwere helped out by numerous\ntrekking guides. Their uncle owned\nthe place, but was in prison for\ndisagreeing with the local mafia-style corrupt authorities.\nWe were strongly advised to take\na guide with us. Not only because\nthey were there to make money out\nof people like us, but because it was\na long way to the next village,\nacross raw mountain with few\nrecognisable tracks, with little to\nguide and a lot of potential for\ngetting lost. To chew over the idea,\nwe stripped our bikes of all luggage\nand climbed up to Lake Tizlit to\nwatch the sun setting. It we were\ntold was a mysterious lake stooped '\nin legend of kings, forbidden\nmarriages and Romeo and Juliet\nstyle tragedies. The little reservoir\nstyle puddle we discovered was\nmore like an East Anglian pleasure-boating lake.\nThe intense heat we had been\nhiding from all day was now\ndisappearing faster than the sun. In\na chilly twilight we swerved and\nbounced on our bikes like slalom\nskiers towards the little burning\nfires of Imilchil. As we passed a herd of goats and some tiny scruffy\nchildren, I slowed down and\nThe view from Rain in deepest\nscooped one out of the dust. He\nclung speechless and grinning as he\nsquatted side saddle on my cross\nbar, his little warty hands clutching\nthe handle bars and occasionally\ngrabbing at his bobble hat to push\nit out from his eyes. He greeted new\nknots of children at the side of the\nroad like a little king, gabbling for\nthem to join the rabble of chuckling,\nstumbling kids behind.\nWe ate oily omelette and bread\nthat night. Whilst Stephane quizzed\nSaid - one of the guides - about the\nroute, I went off for a stroll.\nHassan, another guide joined me at\na distance to act as a guard. Near\nthe market square I found a man\nwho had lectured at the School of\nOriental and African Studies\n(SOAS) in London, between 1974\nand 1984. He asked me how the city\nwas now, and we swapped\ncomments on the place. The very\nedge of town seemed to be\nMorocco\npopulated by women and young\ngirls. Hassan suggested I marry all\nthe single ones!\nAs I walked away, all the young\ngirls lined up near a wall and\nclapped, as they swayed their hips\nand sang 'Donnez-moi un\ndirham.... don nez moi un dirham'\n(give me a dirham - the unit of\nMoroccan currency). They came\nscuttling after me, sucking other\nbystanders into the throng, until I was surrounded like a Queen Bee.\nOne little girl, her arms open wide\nbegged me to take her with me. I scooped her up and carried her\nthrough the crowds back into town.\nShe clung like a tiny pipistrelle bat\nand I wished I could take her\nfurther. Taking a last look at her\nsoft brown eyes I put her down in\na doorway and turned my back on\nthe children of Imilchil as the rain\nfell on the mud brick streets.\nNext, the mountains take their toll\nPage 9\n\n"

We are\ndelighted by the increase in students\nwho regularly buy their textbooks\nfrom us, especially as some people\nwrongly believe their books may be\ncheaper elsewhere. This comes\nfrom all the publicity given to\nDillons about undercutting\npublishers' prices. However, they\nonly do this on top sellers such as\nfiction, as it is not worth their while\nselling specialised texts at a discount\nprice. So, as the Net Book\nAgreement stands, every bookseller\nis bound by law to sell books at the\npublishers' specified price; a difference in price only occurs\nbetween shops if a new edition or\nreprint comes out, then the latest\ncopy tends to be more expensive.\nSo, whilst you can rest assured\nthat you don't have to pay more for\nthe books that are available on your\ndoorstep, you will also find that we\ntry to offer all stationery goods at\nprices that beat High Street\nretailers. The policy at ICU Bookstore has always been to keep\nprofits to a minimum in order to\nachieve low prices on essential\nstudent buys such as paper, pens\nand files\u2014we even managed to\nreduce the price of paper and lever\narch files this year. However, if we\nhave slipped up and you find an item of the same quality at a lower\nprice elsewhere, please let us know\nand we'll be happy to investigate.\nSince we try to offer the best\ndeals for students, it is\ndisappointing that, as well as an\nincrease in sales this year, we have\nsuffered a large increase in the\namount of shoplifting. Textbooks in\nparticular are disappearing and\nunfortunately, if we lose money to\nthieves during the year, we are not\nable to offer the lowest prices next\nyear, so it's really fellow students\nwho lose out. With this in mind, we\nare installing a security system\ngoing live on February 1st, which\nshould either deter thieves or catch\nthem as they leave the shop. It's a pity that we've had to introduce\nthis, and we hope there won't be\nany teething problems, but for your\nown peace of mind please ensure\nyou get, and keep, your receipt\nfor major purchases.

With\nover 100 clubs and societies within\nImperial College Union, it is indeed\nstrange that this section is not\ncrammed with articles every week.\nIn fact, the converse is true. This\nwas bla tandy obvious in the last two\neditions of Felix. In the first issue\nthis term, the column was scrapped\nand in the second one (i.e. last\nweek), the articles were cleverly\nspread out and there was still space\nfor notices on the Health Centre and\nNew Year Carnival.\nThe blame here does not lie with\nFelix, but with the Clubs and\nSocieties concerned. I hope that in\nfuture there would be more\nsubmissions, so that this column\ndoes not die out. A point I should\nlike to make is that this column is\none way to promote a certain club\nor society to the rest of the Imperial\nCommunity. By writing in about\nactivities of your club or society\nothers will be informed and perhaps\neven interested to participate out of\ncuriosity or interest.\nI would like to address this in\nparticular to all overseas so cie ites. Use Felix to convert your culture\nand way of life to the others. As\nmost members of an overseas\nsociety are of that country of origin,\nthe purpose of spreading knowledge\nof culture, tradition and way of life\nto others (as most overseas societies\nhave proclaimed in the Union\nhandbook!) is somewhat reduced in\ncapacity. At least by regularly\ninforming others through Felix this\nparticular purpose of you society is\nserved. Do not waste this\nopportunity please.\nSang Ratnam, Civ Eng 2.\nWhy don't you\nDear Jonty,\nWhen I first arrived at Imperial\nCollege, I was a little over-awed by\nthe place, the people, the bits 'n' bobs. I thought, 'Wow, this place\nis great'. I still do, 1.2 terms later.\nOn arrival I also thought, 'Wow,\nwhat a great magazine; it must have\na truly amazing editor.' and 'Wow,\nwhat a great college; it must have\na truly amazing president.' I still\ndo.\nHowever, I also think that the\nTrouble\nDear Jonty,\nI was wondering if there was a way\nof dismissing permanent members\nof staff, in the same way that we as\nICU students can get rid of\nsabbaticals, via votes of no\nconfidence?\nI ask this question because I was\nunfortunate in having to ask a question to the ICU receptionists\npertaining to Union activities. This\nsimple question was met with a barrage of un helpfulness. grow up little\neditor of Felix and the president of\nIC Union have better things to do\nwith their time than have a go at\neach other in the hallowed pages of\nFelix just because they apparently\nhave a slight personality mismatch.\nCome on lads, you're both big boys\nnow.

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n1 U U111 Issue95529 January 1993\nHolbein Complaints\nby Jacob Andelin\nResidents of Holbein House have\ncomplained this week about a lack\nof facilities after last year's hall\nrefurbishment. Most student\ncomplaints were due to the absence\nof a common room, though some\nadded that the refurbished\naccommodation provided was of an\n'excellent' quality.\nSpeaking to Felix, a postgraduate student, who didn't want\nto be named, said, 'morale is very\nlow in the house at the moment, and\nstudents are annoyed because of the\nlack of communal facilities'. He\nadded that the students who were\nliving in the hall last year, of which\nhe was one, were not consulted on\nwhich amenities they wanted. He\nalso said that current students had\nnot been informed that there would\nbe no common room before they\nmoved in. The 1992/3 edition of the\nCollege produced Accommodation\nhandbook said that the hall would\nhave aTV room, daily papers and\na reading room.\nIn an interview with Felix,\nGordon Marshall, Director of\nEstates, said that he was not\npersonally aware of any student\ngrievances. Mr Marshall added that\nBasketball Trip\nhe didn't know whether or not\nstudents were consulted or informed\nabout the changes. Mr Marshall\ncontinued by saying that if\napproached, he would consult with\nthe Warden of Holbein House about\nproviding a television room, and\nadded that he didn't envisage any\nproblems with Holbein residents\nusing facilities in other halls.\nHolbein Hall has now been\nseparated into its three constituent\nhouses, and two of these houses\nwere opened around Christmas.\nAlthough all houses were due to\nopen in October 1992, work is still\ncontinuing on the third house. Mr Marshall said the houses had been\nseparated to comply with new fire\nregulations. This is disputed by\nsome living in Holbein Hall, who\nclaim that the houses were separated\nto bring the number of students in\neach house below the level for\nwhich it is legally necessary to build\ncommunal facilities. It was alleged\nthat this was designed to increase\nincome earned from the hall. The\nremaining construction work is due\nto finish on the 18th of March, and\ntotal expenditure is expected to top\nthree quarters of a million pounds.\nOn Saturday, Imperial College's Basketball teams will fly to Moscow\nto compete in an international\ntournament.\nThe com pet ion will take place\nbetween the 31st January and the\n6th February, with teams from\nAusralia, France, Wales and Russia\ntaking part. One women's and one\nmen's team will be representing\nImperial at the games. Once in\nMoscow, the Imperial side will play\ngames in the morning, leaving the\nafternoon free for sightseeing tours.\nAnette Fidrich, the tour\norganiser, told Felix that the trip\nwas 'a bit unreal'. 'I didn't believe\nit would happen', she added,\ncommenting on the speed with\nwhich the trip was organised and\nsupported by range of sources at\nshort notice. It is believed that Sir\nEric Ash, Imperial's Rector, a Japanese sponsor, Imperial College\nUnion, and Imperial's Marketing\nDepartment helped the plan\nsucceed.\nmm1> sails\nHolbein Yesterday\nIC Attack\nby Gareth Light, News Editor\nTwo female Imperial College\nstudents have been attacked\nand assaulted by five men. The\nattack, outside the Mathematics and\nComputing Department in Queen's Gate, took place on Friday 11\nDecember 1992, one week before\nthe end of last term.\nAccording to one of the victims,\nthe five men were moving north\nalong Queen's Gate when they\nsurrounded the women. When one\nof the women was grabbed from\nbehind, she started to scream and\nlash out at her assailant. At this\npoint, another of the men became\nextremly violent. He 'Karate\nkicked' and punched both the\nwomen, inflicting only superficial\ninjuries.\nThe men eventual y ran away\ntowards Hyde Park. After giving\nchase, the women managed to\napprehend one man, forcibly\ndragging him to the Imperial\nCollege Union building. The man\nwas taken into the custody of\nCollege security, who then called\nthe Police.\nThe Police later took statements\nfrom both of the women, and took\nthe man away for questioning. In\ncustody, he told the Police that he\nwas a former member of Imperial\nCollege, and that he was on his way\nto an Indian Society function in the\nJunior Common Room (JCR), in\nthe Sherfield Building. Further\ninvestigation lead the Police to\nbelieve that the man gave a false\nname. Police added that the victims\nwould have to identify the other\nattackers in identity parades,\nsomething which neither of the\nwomen were prepared to do.\nThis incident is the latest in a series of personal attacks against\nwomen on College grounds.\nImperial College Union has\nreminded students that rape alarms\nare still available at no charge from\nthe Union Office.\n7 9 Centre 14-17\nHospital Riley Rag Reviews\nOpening Continues Pull-Out Round-up\n\n"

This was the 'Julian\nCope Love in' that drew me up to\nKentish Town last Guy Fawkes\ninstead of following the masses to\nBattersea Park and finding out it had\nbeen cancelled.\nTo make up, he obviously felt\nobliged to give us good value by\nbeing both support and headline\nwith two sets, the latter having a solo acoustic half. The first was a warm-up consisting of Jehovah kill\nand Peggy Suicide dressed in\nleopard skin leggings and baggy\nshirt emphasising his scrawny\nframe. His invitation to 'treat us just\nlike the support' was taken all too\nliterally. From the opening\n'Upwards 45\u00b0' through the funky\n'East Easy Rider' and until the last\ntwo songs the crowd swayed ever\nso gently if at all.\nOnly for the immensely toe\ntapping 'Hanging out and Hung up\non the Line' did the audience have\na token mosh. Don't get me wrong\nthe sound was fine. The playing was\ntight and his cheerful and slightly\ncamp repartee was quite enough to\nentrance his fans but there was\nsomething missing.\nWe went upstairs for the second\nset and I found myself standing next\nto Nigel Kennedy, having a smoke.\nI was just about to ask him why he\ndidn't shove his Strad down that\npomp us prodigal tw at' s throat on\nWogan the other week, when he\nand his girlfriend up and left.\nAnother scoop bites the dust!\nAnyway back to the concert. As\nI said the second set commenced\nwith a few songs with just him and\nhis guitar. Again the crowd went\nwild, with appreciation for\n'Pristeen' and 'Robert Mitchum'.\nWhat everybody was waiting for\nwas the rock 'n' roll set. The\nreaction was immediate when phase\nthree started with 'World Shut Your\nMouth'. Thank God. From then on\nhe hit the 30 song mark with new\nand old material including 'Double\nVegetation', 'Poet is Priest' and\nhalf of 'Floored Genius'.\nHe's weird 'Maybe I'm a lesbian\nin a man's body\u2014yeah I like that'\nbut he's also brilliant and at the\nheight of his powers and we knew\nit. The set ended with Lynx's anthem 'Reward the Fox' and the\nencore was short but sweet with\nTear Drop Explodes debut\n'Reward'. Almost three hours on\nstage and he still is the bouncing\nbaby of the early 80s. Pity the\ncrowd took so long to get into it.\nAlex.\nMy Life Story \u2014Marquee\n18.1.92\nMy Life Story are the best fuckin'\nband on the whole God damn\nplanet. GET THE MESSAGE?\nLise Yates.\n\u2022 My Life Story are currently\nunsigned.

It's beautiful, just\ntotally rocking, man. No. Not the\nmusic. The clear plastic CD case.\nArt & Functionality, and it's just so,\nso, so beautiful. As for the music,\nit sounds like The Cult used to.\nWhat's going on?\nLise Yates.\n\u2022 Out Monday on Beggar's Banquet.\nAbove: The Julie Dolphins.\n'There's always one bastard who ruins it by smiling'\nAlbums The Julie Dolphin \u2014Roses Extreme\u2014Tragic Comic\nNo-one talks much about the wine\nlakes or the butter mountains\nanymore. So, perhaps they are no\nlonger with us. Still, in the world\nof 'popular' music, the scrap heap of indie bands remains steadily\naccumulative. The influx of bands\nlike The Julie Dolphin suggests that\nit will remain so. Which is not to\nsay that they are a terrible band,\nrather that there is no direction or\nspark in their music. They are\nprobably nice people who look after\nhomeless dingos, but when it comes\nto stringed instruments that's not\nenough.\nSounding somewhere between a Extreme; known for their dewy\nballad which all A OR bands are\nobliged to release, and also as fine\nexamples of another rock\nphenomena: the growing\nboring ness of professionalism.\nThis single captures their\nproblem in a shell. Take one semi-interesting idea for a song, say that\ntimeless clown Charlie Chaplin,\nthen reduce that 'Tragic Comic' to\na symbol in a trite Top 30 lu r ve song.\n'Just call me a tragic comic, cause\nI'm in, in love with you.'\nThe song itself sways along in a friendly acoustic manner trying to\nmake something of itself, before\nbeing cruelly stamped on by the\nchorus. It is a lost opportunity to\nregain the rawness of earlier work,\nI fear it could be big in America.\nTintin.\n\u2022 'Tragic Comic' is released on\n25th Jan.\nThe Cult\u2014Pure Cult\nYes, yes, ok, so I 've been caught\ndancing to 'She Sells Sanctuary',\nand I really went to a Cult show,\nonce. (November '89, if I recall\ncorrectly), but, somewhere around\n1990, The Cult lost the highway to\nRock City, and followed a wagon\ntrain to Blacker (??\u2014TS)\nReservation, home of the Indian\ntribe of such pap as the last album.\nAnd then to top it all, and doesn't this look a bit strange given their\ncurrent hit, at Finsbury Park last\nJune, they announced the 'new era'\nof Cult, and that they'd never play\n'Sanctuary' again. Oh Ian, Oh\nBilly, where did you go? Ever since\n'87, you've been sliding down\npop's dum per, picking up baggage\nlike moss, and as a chronicle of the\ndemise of the goth-rock culture, this\ngreatest hits album is unparalleled.\nLise Yates.\n\u2022 Out on Monday, on Beggar's Banquet.\nThe Tragically Hip\u2014Fully\nCompletely\nApparently the Hip are very big in\ntheir native Canada. Which is not\nto belittle them. They follow in deep\nfootsteps as Canadian artists have\nbeen no slouches in the music\narena: KD Lang, Robbie\nRobertson, Cowboy Junkies, The\nMcGarrigles, Mary Margaret\nO 'Hara have all hailed North of the\nAmerican border.\nThe smoke of 'Laissez Faire'\nhangs heavy over much of the\nalbum as if you, the listener, were\nactually there, facing the great\nplains which stretch for miles\naround, swathed in a kind of eerie\nbleakness. Best illustrated by the\nepic 'At the Hundredth Median', it\nembraces an intensity seldom\nreached without recourse to the\nfeedback wall of Jesus and Mary\nChain. The world's bread bin packs\na quality all of its own. The other\nreinforcing quality of the band is a certain melodic poise which is\nsweetly short and tight\u2014as in\n'Pigeon Camera' and 'We'll Go\nToo'. Alas, some of the shots are\nwide of the mark, as the Hip get\nbogged down in too many puddles\nof AOR infection.\nThere are plenty of bands in the\nsame scene as The Tragically Hip,\nwho's to say whether they are the\nbest? But you could certainly do\nworse than lending them your ears.\nTintin.\nPage 14\n\n"

    "content": "A Kurt Weill Cabaret\nI read in my music dictionary (yes,\nsome of us do attempt some\nresearch for these beautifully\ncrafted novellas known as\nreview-biz):\n'Kurt Weill (1900-50). Germanborn composer. Using some jazz-based idioms, he had early success\nwith the 'Threepenny Opera', and\nwith 'Rise and Fall of the City of\nMahogonny'\u2014both texts by Brecht\nwith satirical criticism of capitalist\nsociety. Penalised by the Nazis as\na Jew and a composer of 'decadent'\nmusic he settled in the USA, 1935.\nHis American works include music\nto various Broadway musical plays.\nOther works include a cantata and\ntwo symphonies.'\nWow, and I just thought he wrote\n'Mack the Knife' and 'May to\nDecember'.\nThe little cast of four (plus\nexcellent pianist Paul Chilvers) in\nthis little super-pub Theatre\nprovided a performance that, if\nnothing else, gave an explosive\ndelivery of the music, spanning less\nwell known classical ballads\nthrough to his Broadway hits.\nUnfortunately neither of the two\nfemale performers seemed very\nwell suited to Weill's eclectic\nidiom. Denise Silvery would have\nbeen more at home on an opera\nstage although, wide-eyed and arms\nakimbo, she gave each song all she\nhad, Jane Wheldon seemed to be\nhappier singing in her lowest\npossible register or, preferably, not\nsinging at all, using an admirable\n'sprach gesang' style. The male cast\nwere more at ease with the whole\naffair, using their light, though\nrather bland, baritone voices to\ngood effect.\nThe first eleven songs were in\nGerman so to someone like me,\nwith complete ineptitude for\nlanguages (including English, alas)\nthe sole method of any\ncomprehension (other than peering\nin the gloom at my programme\nnotes) was through the cast's tight\ndelivery, although sometimes over\nchoreographed to the point of\nvulgarity.\nApparently this show played to\npacked houses in Amsterdam.\nMaybe the Dutch audiences, like\nme, didn't care about not\nunderstanding a word that was sung\nand were happy to let the wonderful\nmusic wash over them as they\nenjoyed a meal and a couple of\npints.\nGwen.\n\u2022 Canal Cafe Theatre, Bridge\nHouse, Delamere Terrace, W2,\nWarwick Ave tube.

The\nladies through down the gauntlet\nlast term and the men were so\nbemused that they have agreed to\nplay in suspenders and Wellington\nboots to give the gir lies a chance.\nBut will they need a chance?\nYou have the chance to find out\nby coming along and supporting the\ngreatest challenge since men\nreached the moon. Kick off is at\n2.00pm on Sunday 31st January,\nand coaches will be leaving from\nBeit Quad at Midday. For the\nbargain price of \u00a33.00 you will be\nferried in the lap of luxury to the\nOsterly pitches to watch this\nextravaganza, with a bar open all\nday to keep you refreshed. Coaches\nreturn at 6.00pm to give you time\nto recover for the pub crawl in the\nevening. Tickets are available in\nadvance only, from the RSMU\nOffice, the ICU Office and\nmembers of the ladies Rugby team.\nLimited tickets will be available on\nthe day on a first come first served\nbasis.\nIf you can't make the match but\nfancy walking off with a prize\nanyway, we are running a sweepstake on the score, so pop\nalong to the RAG Stall in the JCR\nat lunchtime today to stake your\nclaim on a result. Scores can also\nbe bought on the day but the stakes\nclose at kick off. This promises to\nbe one wacky event so miss it at\nyour peril, after all, what else is\nthere to do on a Sunday afternoon?\nTOP PRESS:STOP PRESS:STOP\nNews has just come in that there's more to RAG Week than crazily\nexcellent events. Services will be\noperating all week round and, for\na small fee, you can get just about\nanything done to just about anyone.\nCity and Guilds Union are running\ntheir notorious Hitsquad and the\nRoyal College of Science are doing\nGrim Reaping, Pint-o grams,\nhandcuff-o grams and MilkyMilky-o grams (for Mary\nWhitehouse Experience fans).\nTo explain these further (for\nanyone who has been hibernating\nfor the first half of the year)\nHitsqaud provides you with the\no port unity to get a flan placed in the\nface of your best friend or worst\nenemy. Lecturers are not out of the\nquestion if you can club together to\ncover the danger money, and, if you\nthink the final year students are too\nboring, why not get a mass hit taken\nout on an entire lecture? Hits can\nbe booked on production of a union\ncard and some cash at the C& GU Office in Mech Eng. Contact lens\nwearers should get themselves a free badge also from the C& GU office to prevent flan s hitting them\nin the face and, if you feel you are\nlikely to get hit more than you'd like, immunity can be bought from\nthe same place.\nGrim Reaping involves setting a grim reaper to follow someone\naround all day until they cough up\nenough money to get rid of them.\nFor a small charge you can have a pint and a packet of bar nibbles\ndelivered to someone (even\nyourself) during a lecture, lab,\ntutorial...you tell us where, when\nand who and we'll sort it out.\nHandcuff-o grams involve\nhandcuffing two victims together\nuntil they cough up sufficient\namounts of money to get the keys.\nWho do you hate enough to\nhandcuff them to that smelly,\nboring, person in the corner? For\nany of these services pop along to\nthe RCS Office, round the back of\nChemistry and see one of the\nfriendly bod s inside.\nAlso running throughout RAG Week will be Killer. This has been\ncovered in previous issues of Felix\nbut, just to re-cap, the aim is to be\nthe only contestant left alive at the\nend of RAG Week. There are Cash\nPrizesfor the winners and the\nplaying is a load of fun too. To\nenlist, turn up at the RCS Office\nwith two passport photos and \u00a32.50.\nYou will be presented with a set of\nrules and your first target.

The eight IC men also\nperformed very well\u2014notably\nSimon Thomas (8th), Dave Knight\n(17th) and the very speedy\noriente er \u2014Jake Badger (20th).

The IC\nIndoor Soccer Tournament (IC\n1ST) is about to kick off and I hope\nteams are raring to fight for the\nmagnificent IC 1ST trophy won last\nyear by the overwhelming skill and\ncompetence of the IC 1st team. This\nyear, to enable all societies to have\nan even chance of winning the\nprize, it was necessary to limit the\nnumber of Imperial College\nFootball Club players per team to\ntwo. This, of course, means that\nthere will be no IC football teams\nin the tournament. After all this is\nmore of a fun tournament and not\nour chance to get stuffed!!\nIn order to have better control of\nprocedures and fixtures it was felt\nthat the number of teams entering\nthe tournament shall be limited to\nsixteen. All societies/clubs who\nwish to enter must either be under\nthe banner of the Overseas Students\nCommittee (OSC) or affiliated\ndirectly to Imperial College Union.\nThere will be an entrance fee of \u00a35\nper team, the same as last year.\nThese monies plus funds donated by\nthe OSC will be awarded back to\nthe semi-finalists and finalists in the\nform of trophies and prizes. Each\nsociety/club can enter only one\nteam unless the response to the\ntournament is poor\n(UNLIKELY!!).

    "content": "Felix 955\nO pinion\n29 January 1993\nEditorial\nFax trouble\nOn Wednesday evening, a fax was\nreceived at Imperial College Union\ncontaining an article from New\nStatesman and Society, about\nalleged extra marital affairs of a certain John Major, a prime\nminister. This fax was taken to IC\nRadio and parts of it broadcast in\na piece about the article. As the\nissue was clearly going to make\nnational news and a coup for IC\nRadio before it appeared in the\nnational media, the transmission\nwas fully justified.\nYesterday, some delightful\nindividual rang Felix demanding to\nspeak to Declan Curry, the\njournalist who covered this story.\nClaiming to be from Carr Dunbarr\nAssociates, he left a return phone\nnumber saying that they were\nconsidering legal action against IC\nRadio.\nNeedless to say this turned out to\nbe a false return number, of a nonexistent legal firm, about whom the\nassistant to the editor of the New\nStatesman and Society had never\nheard. Can I now serve notice if I find the worthless scum that gave\nme a near heart attack, I will feed\nhim slowly through the collating\nmachine that puts Felix together\nevery week. This low life will be\nhunted high and low until he is\ntracked down and has his entrails\nripped from his snivelling body.\nWinding me up on a Thursday\nafternoon is a crime against\nhumanity and the perpetrator\ndeserves every bad luck, fate can\nheap upon him.\nGagged?\nIf you have a spare moment pick\nup a copy of London Student,\nstudent newspaper of the year, and\nread the story on page three about\nGoldsmith Students' Union's financial troubles. If you compare\nthe two stories, our coverage is very\nsimilar to that of London Student.\nWhy is this? We are a College\nmagazine covering the story\nbecause it is so large and it effects\nthe University of London. Yet\nLondon Student a newspaper for the\nwhole of the University of London\nthinks a small demonstration by\nstudents about saving St\nBartholomew's Hospital is more\nimportant. More significant that\nBarts has been saved from closure,\nso there is nothing to demonstrate\nabout.\nCould this be an example of\nexecutive pressure on the Editor of\nLondon Student by 'Senior\nSabbaticals'? I hope this is not the\ncase and that Mike Herd is\nupholding the freedom of the press\nin the same rigorous manner all his\npredecessors have.\nNaughty\nWhat is this our eagle eyes\naround college see? Our beloved\nestates electrician pushing the tools\nof his trade around in a Sainsbury's shopping trolley? Surely not the\nsame behaviour followed by Felix\nand condemned by the Rector, a few years ago?\nWriters\nNeeded: A group of creative,\nambitious people, with the ability to\ntransfer the spoken word into print\nand the confidence to hassle the rich\nand famous. If you can provide the\ntalent, we can provide a phone line\nand 4000 copies of your completed\ntext every Friday during term.

This issue is dedicated\nto Winona Ryder.\nStop Press: Deadline to apply for Easter Vacation Accommadation is 31st January 1993\nCat's Eyes\nMadonna\nWill the members of the press leave\nMadonna alone. They always jump\nat the chance to bury her no matter\nwhat she does. If some other actress\nhad played the role that Madonna\nhas in Body Of Evidence, then it\nwould not have got such\ndisapproval from the putrid yankee\npress. They would have sat quietly\nuntil the end and then given the\nthumbs down. But oh no, because\nit stared Madonna, they stood up\nand booed, hissed and jeered as\nsoon as the film started. They didn't really go into the preview with a closed mind, did they?\nExam Stress\nThere has been a lot of blurb and\nwaffle lately about coping with\nexams, getting counselling etc etc.\nWith the relaxed atmosphere that is\nuniversity life, I find it sad to think\nthat some people still get stressed\nover exams and course work. Why\nworry? I am not saying that to have\nno worry is normal, if anything it\nis abnormal, but so is too much.\nAccording to some counsellors/\ntherapists/know-all's, the start of\nthe road to hypertension and heart\nattacks at 40 is not learning to relax\nwhile attending any course which\ninvolves an exam at the end. So\nyour chosen career depends on the\nresults of your exams, big deal.\nSEX\nIt's that time of year again. One\nmonth after the Christmas holiday\nand all the films which are nothing\nbut excuses for explicit sex scenes\nare released. You know the ones,\nevery 20 minutes at least there is yet\nanother romp, whether it be in the\nbedroom, the hall, the lift, the\ngarden, the car etc. Why do the\ndistributors wait until this time of\nyear, when generally speaking, not\nmany people have any money left\nto go and see these films? Why\ndon't they release them all year\nround? What bastards!\nSmoking\nI am not that angry nor that fed up\nwith smokers who moan that their\nright to light-up is being taken\naway, but more frightened. I do not\nwant to end up fighting for my life\nwith lung cancer and have to watch\nas my family stand over me\nworrying if this day will be my last.\nI am a non-smoker and do not\nobject to anyone who wishes to kill\nthemselves slowly over 40 to 60\nyears, so long they don't inflict the\npotential suffering that they might\nexperience on me.\nThe Monarchy\n'Relinquish the Monarchy!' they\ncry. Anti-royalists unite more\nstrongly with the publication of the\nCamillagate tapes, which they say\nis the final nail in the coffin.\nDivorces here, alleged affairs there,\nlots of money being paid to them,\nfires, scandals, the list grows week\nby week. I can see why some want\nto break-up one of the few things\nthat makes our country unique, but\nthey shouldn't. With European\nunification, our monarchy is\npossibly the only way to keep our\nidentity. It needs drastic and\nimmediate reforms though if we\nwant to be proud of our monarchy\nagain, and keep them off the front\npages.\nP.J.

Initially this seems a curious use of limited, and costly,\nground space. However there are\nadvantages to this approach. Most\nof the rooms have windows either\ninto a courtyard or out to the real\nworld, communication between\ndepartments and wards is facilitated\nby the open walkways and 60% of\nthe building will be naturally\nair-conditioned.\nThe size of the courtyards\nactually decreases as you descend\nthrough the building, such that the\nlower ground floor is nearly solid.\nThey give a feel of size and space\nthroughout the building without\nrequiring expensive and energy\ninefficient external walls.\nAt night time .the pastel blue\nshades and lighting give a chilled\ntone, but the warmth of daylight\nfalling into the courtyards should\nmake it much more inviting.\nThe overall impression is not\ndissimilar to the larger modern\nAmerican prisons. Hopefully the\nhospital will come alive as the\nwards open and the walkways bustle\nwith patients and staff.\nThere are some extraordinary,\neven bizarre, details\u2014a vivid\nyellow hut, with a green corrugated\nroof, looks as though it has been\ndropped into one of the open\nspaces. Aside from comments about\nthe workmen leaving their site hut\nbehind, it seems that it serves as the\n'Sanctuary of Unity', or multi-faith\ntemple.\nThe X ray department, equipped\nwith the latest imaging and scanning\nmachine, seemed rather short on\nwindows. This is not helped by\nbright orange walls, even in the\nwaiting area.\nThe best view of London, so we\nwere informed, is from one of the\noperating theatres\u2014I suppose the\npatients will appreciate the surgeon\nenjoying the view half-way through\nan operation!\nIf there are not too many suicides\noff the high walkway, it should\nprove a practical and fairly pleasant\nhospital.\nSTILL PAYING\n20% MORE\nthan you should for phone calls?
