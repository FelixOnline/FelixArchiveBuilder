    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 07 JUNE\n10\nmet Jennifer Louise Martin in\nthe food hall at Selfridges. To\nget there I had to walk through\nthe cosmetics hall. hrough\nthe haze of perfume, immaculate girls stared out with twinkling\neyes, watching my progress as I picked\nmy way though counters stacked with\nfoundation, mascara and lipsticks. I\nhad wondered whether Jennifer was\nsetting herself up to make a point. As it\nemerged, she is far too straightforward\nfor intricate ploys.\nJennifer has just \ufb01nished her \ufb01rst solo\nshow in London at the Strand Gallery.\nHer rich textured paintings depict glamour models plucked from the pages of\nmagazines. he images are as layered\nconceptually as they are in paint, laced\nwith subtext and questions about the\nillusory nature of perfection and the af\ufb02iction of beauty.\nMeredith homas: Can I start of by\nasking how you got into art?\nJennifer Louise Martin: I went to St\nMartins for a foundation in 1999, then\nI actually did a psychology and neuroscience degree for three years. After\nthat I went back to St Martins in 2005.\nI really loved St Martins and my foundation course is really what got me into\noil painting. I fell in love with paint and\never since then I never stopped doing\nit. In between the years I was studying\npsychology. I always tried to continue\nmy art, but painting fell by the wayside because I didn\u2019t have the time. I\ndidn\u2019t really have the space or studio to\npaint. I did a bit of fashion and made my\nown clothes. I was always creative but I\nwent back to paining when I graduated\nuniversity. I became much more artistic having really missed my painting. I\ntaught myself quite a lot because I had\nto keep it going.\nM: How would you say that your study\nof psychology has informed that work\nyou do?\nJ: It de\ufb01nitely informs the work I do,\nbecause I am interested in the psyche\nof the female mind. How women perceive beauty, how women think about\nit and try and obtain it... What does this\nactually mean to women? hese are the\nquestions I am interested in. here is a\nwhole market out there, makeup, plastic\nsurgery,allthesethingthatwomenthink\nabout, spend money on. he psychology\nbehind beauty really informs my work,\nfrom a women\u2019s point of view.\nM: How long had you been painting\nbefore these shows came up?\nJ: It would be about ten years on-ando\ufb00. I\u2019ve done a lot of residencies where\nI have gone and lived and painted in a\nstudio, then shown my work at the end.\nSince about 2005 I have been interested\nin female faces and portraits from magazines and photographs. Its been a theme\nfor a long time.\nM: So how did that develop?\nJ: It started when I went to Los Angeles.\nhat inspired me a lot because, obvious-ly, you\u2019ve got the whole plastic surgery\nculture and the theme of beauty is really\nprominent. My painting style changed\nquite a bit there, it became a bit more\nphotorealistic. You can see the faces and\nfeatures are more prominent, the lips\nand the eyes.\nM: I want to get into this idea of beauty a bit more. Do you see beauty in the\nmodels that you paint?\nJ: Yeah, but the images I choose, are a\nhuge part of the process. It takes me a\nlong time to \ufb01nd a picture to work from.\nI will scour through heaps of magazines\nand it would be something about the\nimage that captures me, either the face,\nthe structural features, or just the way\nthe photograph is taken, the colour or\nthe composition. Mainly it is because I\nwill \ufb01nd that person beautiful.\nM: So is it the person or the photo-graph?\nJ: Not the person, the face! So probably\nthe photography, the way that they have\nbeen shot or how it looks to me. It could\nbe the way the photograph is taken,\nyou\u2019re right, it could be that.\nM: Do you ever get the same reaction\nto something in life?\nJ: I do get that. It has happened a couple of times where I have actually approached someone in a restaurant or at\nwork where their face has just popped\nout at me and I have asked to paint\nthem. his happened recently. She had\nsuch eye catching features that I approached her in a restaurant. hat\u2019s the\n\ufb01rst time I\u2019ve done that. She is now my\nnext sitter. I will do studies from life and\nthen I take a picture and work from that.\nSothistime,withthespeci\ufb01csubjectI\u2019m\nworking from my own photograph.\nYou know It could be an object that is\nbeautiful. For me it just happens to be\nfaces. It could stem back from years ago;\nI wanted to be a model when I was about\neleven.\nM: his is probably too simplistic a\nquestion but, do you think we are too\nbeauty obsessed in this society?\nJ: Oh, totally yeah. And you could argue\nthat I am too.\nM: If you\u2019re changing your approach\nto painting a real person, is that going\nto change the way you react and re-spond, because you are not seeing the\nsubject through the lens of another\nphotographer?\nJ: I think it will do,because it\u2019s more \ufb01rsthand isn\u2019t it? he fact that I have taken\nthe photo means it\u2019s all a bit closer to my\nown hand. But what will happen is that\nit will be a much more natural picture,\nbecause there is no lighting, no staging.\nSo we\u2019ll see how the painting turns out.\nIt will be di\ufb00erent.\nM: How do you start a painting?\nJ: I look at the image for quite a long\ntime. I will absorb the colours straight\naway, I will immediately know my colour palette. As you can see I use a lot\nof tones of the same colour. I like to add\ndepth to give the image some kind of\nstory, it adds a personality to the model,\nthere is a story behind her, sort of paralysed by perfection. You can see they\nare pensive, or thinking. here is this\nkind o\ufb00 destructive self. hat is what I\nam thinking while I am painting which\nis why you get this challenging aspect to\nthe painting.\nM: So there is an element of empa-thising with the subject, even through\nso many layers of paint and another\npersons lens?\nBeauty and the beholder\u2019s eye\nMeredithThomasinterviewsJenniferLouiseMartinonthemalegaze\nI\n\n"

The word \u201ccampus\u201d was used for ease of communication and not to be misleading.\nLOLCATZ OF TEH WEEK: Finding these is a perk of the job\nTim Arbabzadah\nEditor-in-Chief\nOh Gee a\nPoint Average\nwhile ago some universities announced the possibility of using a UK GPA\ninstead of the traditional\ngrading system that we\nuse. This is an interesting idea, and one\nthatisworthyofdebate.TheCollegewill\natsomepointultimatelyhavetochoose\nwhether or not they switch. Imperial are\na cautious lot: College tend to wait until something is tried and tested rather\nthan dive straight in. Maybe it\u2019s the scientist mind set. Of course, this is both\ngood and bad \u2013 it depends on the situation and context. Here, it will just give\nmore time to mull over the idea. If many\nother UK universities switch, Imperial\nwill start having serious discussions. If\nthis ever does become a big topic, the\nupper management of College would\nbe wise to consult with students and\nstaff. The forgotten victims of examinations are often the lecturers and PhD\nstudents that have to mark the papers.\nIt\u2019s unlikely they will be keen to support\na proposal that makes each piece of\nassessment critical and therefore puts\nthem under a lot of extra strain.\nIn essence, I think the current system\nis fine as it is. It allows people to give\nexact marks if they want and employers to ask for exact scores if they are so\ninclined. That little buffer in the current\nsystem is great for markers, students,\nand employers. You\u2019ll always have the\ngrey area of overlap where 59 and 61\naren\u2019t too different from each other \u2013\nbut that is fixable by someone saying\non a CV that they were that close. It\ndoes cause a problem if you are not allowed to apply for a job unless you have\na 2:1, but a GPA doesn\u2019t fix that really.\nInterestingly, the GPA will essentially\nbreak up the grades into smaller sub\ngrades. It\u2019s like if you had low 2:1, mid\n2:1 and high 2:1 on the degree instead\nof just 2:1.\nSo, will employers start asking for\nhigher grades? Probably not. If they\nwanted to, they could already say that\nnobody with less than a first or 65%\nshould apply (and check transcripts to\nsee if people lie). If they ask for a grade\nit will be the same range as before, just\nunder a different name. They will want\nrounded people with loads of interests\nand who fit into their ethos and all that\nother stuff.\nEmployers understand that wiggle\nroom is needed, as grades are not 100%\nspot on. Bad day in the exam hall and\nthat could be a knock to your aver-age; labs are marked by humans who\nmay make mistakes or be a bit erratic\nin marking (in a standard human way),\nand so on and so forth. It boils down to\nthe fact that marking is not as exact as\nyou wish it would be. Employers went\nto university themselves (that person\ninterviewing you was a student once)\nand so know all of this. If they do not\nunderstand, then universities should\ninform them.\nWill people start getting tactical with\noptions? Hell yes, but they do that al-ready. Only those that truly love their\nsubject chose options based on inter-est, the rest just go with what\u2019s the\n\u2018easiest\u2019 option. There is also the danger\nof grade inflation. With people aiming\nfor what used to be a high 2:1 there is a\ntemptation for universities to keep students happy and to rise up the league\ntables by giving out higher grades. Of\ncourse with a system like this people\nwill be more stressed out and worried.\nTheywillwanttogetcertaingradesthat\nhave smaller margins of error. This gets\ncircular in a way: again, you have the\nissue of someone having e.g. 63% and\n65% possibly getting a different clas-sification. Just like before the lines are\nblurry, but now there\u2019s a bigger blur to\nsharp ratio. This is why, in all likelihood,\nemployers will still want the 2:1 equivalent and above. They need to draw a\nline somewhere, why change that line\u2019s\npositionfornorealreason?Youpossibly\nget people who are 3% \u2018better\u2019, but is\nthat really \u2018better\u2019 at the job you will give\nthem? More motivated? Better at working in a team? Some other business\njargon? Nope. That\u2019s why you interview\nthem and look at their cover letter, CV,\nand experience.\nA\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 07 JUNE 11\nJ: Absolutely! What is she really think-ing? What does she really fee? Does she\nlike people staring at her? Doe she like\nwalking out of home and seeing a million cameras? I\u2019m thinking about how it\nwould be for her to be in the subject of\nthe gaze.\nM: How do you deal with that con-flict? On the one hand, with you\npainting,youarebuyingintothiscon-cept totally and on the other you are\ntrying to challenge it.\nJ: I am trying to challenge it. One thing is\nthat these women get totally airbrushed,\nso there are these hidden lies that I try\nand reveal in my painting, just through\nthe use of paint.Because paint,being the\nmaterial that it is, reveals something that\na photograph wouldn\u2019t. And that is why\nI like painting these subjects.\nI challenge it because I know that\nthere is this airbrushed trickery directed\ntowards the public. And they buy into it,\nespecially girls. It\u2019s not really the truth.\nI\u2019m trying to relay something of the\ntruth.\nM: How do you resolve the fact that\nyou clearly do have a sense of beauty,\nso it has a truth for you and yet you\nare looking for the more fundamental levels of truth. And how does that\nconflict resolve itself ?\nJ: here are a couple of pieces in the\nrecent show, Paralysed by Perfection.\nIt\u2019s about this struggle for perfection,\nwhich is a personal thing I have as well.\nOne of the things I actually did was to\ntext the subconscious thoughts as I was\npainting. houghts about how it wasn\u2019t\nperfect. You will see some severe imperfections in my work, the eyes missing\nor some things scrubbed out because.\nI create layers and layers all the time. I\nwant people to see those layers because\nI want to get the message across that\nbeauty isn\u2019t this perfect ideal, it doesn\u2019t\nactually exist. And the reality is that imperfections are what make you perfect.\nWhich has taken me a long time, about\nsix years to come to realise in my work.\nHence this show that I have just done.\nhat is how I have been recently thinking about it. hat is the message I have\nbeen trying to get through.\nM: So when someone buys one of\nyour painting and takes it home, and\nits hanging on their wall what are you\nhoping that their response to it is?\nJ: Some people do think some of them\nare quite horrifying, which used to get to\nme a bit because I don\u2019t make paintings\nto horrify people. [hey are] de\ufb01nitely\nnot decorative, but I want [people] who\nbuy my work to have something to gaze\nat and think about. he people who buy\n[my art] say that the more they look at it\nthe more it changes and the more they\nsee in it and the more they fall in love\nwith it. his epitomises that idea of the\nwomen in their house, which the more\nthat they are around the more they fall\nin love with it [the painting]. [hen there\nis] that whole idea of beauty: when you\nare not beautiful, but you hang out with\nsomeone that is what happens \u2013 you get\nto know them and who they are.\nM: Why do you think beauty is so important to us as a society?\nJ: It goes back to Adam and Eve. It\u2019s\nthe way that we attract people for sex.\nAlso celebrities and the media have a lot\nto do with it. hese girls, they want to\nlook like their idols. We are too scared\nto age naturally too. It\u2019s about keeping\nthat youth.\nM: Do you think it all relates to eroti-cism?Isthereapureaestheticbeauty?\nJ: Do I think that there is an aesthetic\nto strive for? No, I think it\u2019s totally indi-vidual. I think women should age naturally and embrace that. I don\u2019t think you\nshould try and change yourself. Unless\nit is something that a\ufb00ected you inner self so much that, it was something\nyou were genuinely unhappy about. But\nwhen people go and do it on a whim\u2026 It\nhas become and obsession.\nM: How do you respond to the fact\nthat these cultural ideals of beauty\nseem to change so much between different societies and ages?\nJ: I \ufb01nd that really fascinating. I was with\nmy friend a couple of weeks ago and\nshe is from Ghanian culture. he idea\nof beauty in that culture is completely\ndi\ufb00erent to the one that I was brought\nup with. Even from a \ufb01gure aspect, what\nmen \ufb01nd attractive in a women body...\nIs amazing that you can get so locked\ninto what your culture is thinking, the\npatterns that become all you believe is\nbeautiful. Which again, is something\nI have tried to tackle in my work, by\nchoosing muses who are quite quirky.\nBack in the day in 2006 I painted Kate\nMoss. I wouldn\u2019t decide to paint her at\nall now. You do get a lot of models now\nthat are considered quite ugly. So there\nis a \ufb01ne line and I like that.\nM: Have you changed the models\nthat you paint because society has\nchanged that way that they are seen\nor have you have changed the way you\nsee them?\nJ: I think probably more society, because that\u2019s why I\u2019m \ufb01nding them more\nin magazines. It\u2019s the scouts that are\nchanging it and changing other people\u2019s\ntoo.\nM: What do you understand the Gaze\nto be?\nJ: I have taken it to be the stare of someone else\u2019s eyes \ufb01xated on something, or\nsomeone. In this case the model. My\nboyfriend can\u2019t believe how I will gaze at\nwomen in real life, and say I would really\nlike to paint her. He doesn\u2019t understand\nit. It almost comes across as more sexual\nthan he would look at a women. But in a\ntotally di\ufb00erent way\u2026\nM: If you could change society\nthrough your work how would you\nseek to influence the way both men\nand women perceive beauty?\nJ: I think, for both sexes the one thing\nI would try and get across through my\nwork is that beauty is not perfect. here\nis no ideals and it is the imperfections\nthat make someone beautiful.\nM: Do you feel it has been harder trying to break though in that art world\nas a women?\nJ: I have never ever looked at it that way\nbut I am doing a course at the moment\nwhere I am in an open studio with 15\nother painters and most of us, I think\nthe majority, are female. here are about\nfour guys. But hearing them speak it has\ndawned on me that it is very male habit\nin the art world. Men have a big voice\nand women sometimes don\u2019t get heard.\nI don\u2019t think it holds me back in any\nway. he whole feminist art movement\nis obviously very interesting. But it\u2019s not\nreally an issue. I think it\u2019s evening out a\nlot more. It\u2019s a lot di\ufb00erent than it used\nto be. You have the Tracy Emins of this\nworld\u2026\nM: Would you ever paint a male mod-el?\nJ: Yeah, I\u2019ve had a lot of people ask me..\nI\u2019ve never painted a male. hat\u2019s not to\nsay I wouldn\u2019t one day. here\u2019s only ever\none man that I\u2019ve seen and thought, yes,\nI could paint him. here is something\nthat just doesn\u2019t inspire me as much. It is\nto do with sensuality. A lot of the models\nhave the voluptuous lips, but it is a lot to\ndo with makeup as well. I think that is\nprobably why. I do choose images where\nthe women is quite made up because it is\nthe mask over the original beauty under-neath. I try to deconstruct that through\nthe paint. But it is also the colour as well.\nWith the male I just wouldn\u2019t get that.\nBut now that I am painting a girl who\nhas no make up on it could lead to a\nmale, who knows.\nM: What would you tell the eleven\nyear old Jennifer who wants to be a\nmodel?\nJ - Once, a friend on the train got scouted and I didn\u2019t\u2026 It would be exactly that.\nJust because you are not the one scouted\nto be a model, it doesn\u2019t mean you are\nnot good enough or you are not beau-tiful. It\u2019s because they are looking for a\ncertain type of look, a skin, feature. You\nbecome just an objects. People think\nthat being perceived as beautiful is a\ngood thing, but actually. I think sometimes it can be a total affliction. So I\nmade a painting about that. She has no\neye which means she cannot feel people\nstaring and the affliction a beauty.\n\n"

    "content": "ance is about creative expression.\nDance can be narrative art and storytell-ing. Dance can be about structure, discipline and perfection in every detail, or\nit can be about improvisation, spontaneity and exploration. There aren\u2019t many\nforms of art that are so versatile or that\nso well illustrate the intersections between different types of creativity. Especially when the dancers themselves\nare also scientists and engineers. That\u2019s\nwhy on a bright but cold Sunday morning this May, members of the Imperial\nD\nCollege Union Dance Company gathered on campus to help create a photoshoot for this magazine. From the historic backdrop of the Queen\u2019s Tower to\nthe blue-glass mirrored exterior of the\nFaculty building, Imperial\u2019s campus \u2014\nwith its contrasts and contradictions \u2014\nprovided the ideal location. The dancers\ndemonstrated graceful classical ballet\nposes alongside dynamic contemporary techniques. The images we created\nshow how beautiful the different forms\nof dance can be. They also speak of the\nstrength, flexibility, balance and athleti-cism required, developed through many\nhours of dedicated practice.\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 07 JUNE 9\nsidered \u2018women\u2019s work\u2019; dominated by\nwomen, they are lumped together as\n\u2018handicrafts\u2019\n, a genre completely separate \u2013 and far inferior \u2013 to the male-dominated \u2018\ufb01ne arts\u2019\n. he Feminist Art\nmovement of the 1970s tried to address\nthis attitude by elevating the decorative\narts to the level of the \ufb01ne arts, a mission that reached its zenith with Judy\nChicago\u2019s 1979 piece he Dinner Party,\nin which place settings are laid out for\n39 great women from history. Handcrafted table runners celebrated these\nwomen\u2019s achievements, while the plates\nwere decorated with images of butterflies and flowers, symbolic of vulvas, all\nin an e\ufb00ort to celebrate the decorative\narts.\nUnfortunately, very little has changed,\nand the hierarchy of the arts continues\nin the way described by Le Corbusier\nin 1918: \u2018Decorative arts at the bottom,\nand the human form at the top. Because\nwe are men\u2019\n.\nhis focus on female artists often\nprompts the tired question \u2018why are\nthere no great female artists?\u2019 It is a fair\nquestion? Where is the female equivalent of Botticelli? Turner? Picasso? he\nanswer to this question will largely depend on who you ask.\nIf you ask the Evening Standard art\ncritic Brian Sewell, he might tell you\nthat \u2018only men are capable of aesthetic\ngreatness\u2019\n, and that women\u2019s inability\nto create art could be \u2018something to do\nwith bearing children\u2019\n. If you ask Georg\nBaselitz, one of Germany\u2019s leading\npainters, he might tell you that \u2018women\ndon\u2019t paint very well. It\u2019s a fact\u2019\n, backing\nup this claim with the fact that \u2018they\ndon\u2019t pass the market test\u2019\n, despite work\nby impressionist Berthe Morisot being\nmore than twice as expensive as his\nown.\nHowever,ifyouaskLindaNochlin,art\nhistorian at New York University, you\nmight have a rather di\ufb00erent response.\nHer 1971 essay, \u2018Why have there been\nno great women artists?\u2019\n, argues that\nthe lack of great female art is a result of\ncenturies of oppression against women.\nHistorically, the art studio, like many\naspects of life, was closed to women, a\nmale-dominated world.\nhe very few pre-19th century female\nartists are often daughters of other famous painters, such as Artemisia Gentileschi, daughter of Orazio Gentileschi,\nbest known for her visceral work Judith\nSlaying Holofernes. hese women were\nable to break out of the rigid social\nnorms of the time thanks to their position and influence, but how can there\nbe a legacy of great female painters if\nthere is no way for women to access the\narts?\nFor an example closer to home, we\nneed do no more than walk down to\nGreen Park and visit the Royal Academy; founded in 1768 to \u2018promote the\narts of design in Britain\u2019\n, it took another\ncentury until the \ufb01rst women enrolled,\nin 1860. Even then, women were barred\nfrom life drawing until 1893, and even\nthen the subject had to be partially\nclothed. It was not until 1936, nearly\n200 years after it was founded, that a\nwoman was elected to the Royal Academy. With such constraints placed on\ntheir training, it is hardly surprising that\nwe have no female Turner.\nAnother subject Nochlin touches\nupon in her essay is the idea of the\n\u2018golden-nugget theory of genius\u2019; within\nart history there is a tradition, stretching back centuries, of the \u2018genius artist\u2019\n,\nplucked from obscurity and somehow\ndestined to make masterpieces. hey\npossessed the \u2018golden-nugget\u2019 of genius,\nand therefore it was inevitable that this\ngenius would rise to the surface, and\nthe world would know them as a great\npainter, regardless of the circumstances.\nProponents of this theory may point\nto the Florentine painter Giotto, saying\n\u2018Look! He was a mere shepherd\u2019s boy\nbefore somebody noticed his doodles\nand took him on as an apprentice\u2019\n. hey\npoint at Van Gogh and argue that even\nwith his crippling seizures, he was still\nable to produce great art. hey hold\nup Picasso and screech of how he was\nable to pass all the examinations for the\nMadrid School of Art \u2013 an examination that normally took a month \u2013 in a\nweek, at the age of 15. Each example reinforces the idea of the \u2018golden-nugget\u2019\n,\nand tries to silence the feminist critic;\n\u2018if they could do it, why couldn\u2019t she?\u2019\nthey ask. While many professors of art\nhistory are careful to be wary about\nthe authenticity of such tales, the idea\nof the tortured, white, male genius has\nbecome deeply ingrained within the\npublic consciousness; it is a myth that\nexcludes females, rendering the world\nof classical art as a \u2018Boy\u2019s Club\u2019\n.\n\u2018Kathe Kollwitz\u2019\n, one of the founding\nmembers of the Guerrilla Girls, believes\nthat, while the Male Gaze, and the stereotype of the male genius artist have\ncontributed to discrimination, nothing\nholds more power in the art world than\ncold, hard cash. When I ask her about\nthe idea of the Male Gaze, she dismisses\nthe idea, referring instead to \u2018the male\npocketbook\u2019\n.\n\u2018Most art collectors are wealthy men\nwhose taste influences what artists are\nexhibited and collected by museums\u2019\n,\nshe says; \u201chese men donate money\nand artworks to museums and sit on\nacquisition committees that help the\ncurators decide what art to collect. Curators don\u2019t really need help \ufb01guring\nthis out, but they need trustees\u2019 money\nto get the art. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to\nrealize that the system is ripe for corruption since collectors can promote\nacquisitions of work by artists they own,\nand that in turn makes their private collections more valuable\u201d\n.\nLinda Nochlin has said: \u201chose who\nhave privileges inevitably hold on to\nthem, and hold tight, no matter how\nmarginal the advantage involved\u201d\n, and\nwhen we look at the art world it is di\ufb03cult not to see it as \u2018Kathe Kollwitz\u2019 does\n\u2013 a \u2018playground of the 1%\u2019\n.\nhings may sound bleak, but they\nare not hopeless. Organisations such\nas he Guerrilla Girls, and UK Feminista are tirelessly campaigning for major\ngalleries to display more female artists,\nand \u2018Kathe Kollwitz\u2019 singles out the\nTate Modern, Stockholm\u2019s Moderna\nMuseet, and the MoMA as examples\nof museums that are trying to do better.\nBut they cannot do it alone.\nIn Lynn Hershman Leeson\u2019s \ufb01lm\n\u00a1Women Art Revolution!, which documents the growth of feminist art, there\nis a particularly painful scene in which\npeople are stopped outside the MoMA\nand asked to name three female artists.\nNone can. Could you? he subjugation\nof female artists has to end; get in contact with the galleries, and ask them to\naddress the imbalance. Find out more\nabout artists like Louise Bourgeois,\nTamara de Lempicka, and Cindy Sherman. Do not allow the plight of the female artist to be con\ufb01ned to the annals\nof history. he time for change is now!\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 07 JUNE\n6\nPietro Aronica\nhe demonstrator, working late at night, still\nhas a stack of papers to\ncorrect for the following day. hough the bed\nbeckons to him, he relentlessly keeps\ngoing, as students require his slightly-above-minimum wage insights and\ncomments: without his feedback,\nthey would have literally no other way\nto improve their marks. Or so he tells\nhimself, correcting for the umpteenth\ntime that night that the plural of \u201cmomentum\u201d is not \u201cmomentums\u201d.\nHe picks up his reference text to\ncheck if a value is the right one: not\nthe o\ufb03cial answer outline, dated\nand imprecise, but the report of a\nparticularly brilliant student. It has\nequations and sources that the demonstrator does not even know of, and\nsomeone writing such things clearly\nknows what they\u2019re doing. He had\nfelt compelled to give it the maximum marks, sincerely hoping that he\nhadn\u2019t rewarded plagiarism.\nIn comparing the two reports, he\ngoes down the mandatory checklist.\nBackground theory? Convoluted, but\ncheck. Figure explaining that one ef-fect? Check. Equation for said e\ufb00ect?\nCheck. Description of the experi-ment? Incomplete, but check. Discussion of the experiment? It\u2019s wrong,\nbut, hey, at least it\u2019s there. he result\nis one of those reports clearly slapped\ntogether two hours before the dead-line, competent enough to show that\nthe work was (somewhat) done and\nunderstood, and transparent in its Ijust-did-this-because-I-had-to spirit.\nhis kind of report can get more or\nless any mark, depending on how anal\nyou want to be about the precise usage of commas and subscripts, far beyond the demonstrator\u2019s willingness\nto judge. He picks up a book, \ufb02icks\nto a random page and reads the \ufb01rst\nnumber he sees: it is odd. B it is then\nfor this report. He pens a 64 at the\nbottom, and another one is done.\nhe next report appears to be marginally more competently written.\nhere are de\ufb01nitely a lot fewer typos,\nand there is at least a rudimentary notion of how a table should be made.\nBut before he can correct it, the demonstrator has to perform a fundamental step: he searches her name on Facebook. He remembers her from the\nlab, she was the one that had asked\nhim that question he couldn\u2019t answer.\nWell, this\u2019ll teach you to shame me in\nfront of everyone! He scours the re-port, \ufb01nds a number with only three\nsigni\ufb01cant \ufb01gures, and writes \u201cinsuf\ufb01cient precision\u201d in the comments\nsection. He gives it 55, a minute later\namended to 60 because he feels guilty,\nand he goes on to the next one.\nhis reports starts awfully, with a\nterrible, rambling introduction, and\nfor a moment the demonstrator gets\nexcited. His enthusiasm rises through\nblurry images and poorly formatted\nparagraphs, but unfortunately the\ndiscussion of the experiment is im-peccable, and he cannot give it any\nless than a B. Just once, the demonstrator wishes there were a truly disastrous report so that he could take\nout his red pen and write a big F on\nit. \u201cSee me\u201d, he could even write. But\nthere was no report that ever really\ndeserved that, and even those with\nobvious \ufb02aws had some redeeming\nfeature. Reluctantly, he gives it a 69,\ngiggles to himself, and then puts it\naway.\nHe takes another one, and it is a\ngood one: correct use of references,\nproper discussion and interpretation\nand all the rest. Unfortunately for the\nstudent, the demonstrator has run\nout of As to give today. He wouldn\u2019t\nwant to seem too generous, especially\nwhen the other demonstrators are\nboasting about failing people left and\nright, and he has instituted a quota.\nHe feels sorry for the kid, especially\nas he\u2019s recognised him as one of the\nquiet ones, but going back to change\nthe other marks would be entirely too\nmuch e\ufb00ort. He gives it a 68 before\ntaking another report.\nhe pile is still large, and the hour\nis only getting later. It is hard to be a\ndemonstrator.\nhis is (mostly) a work of \ufb01ction. No\ngrade averages were harmed in the\nmaking of this.\nPietro Aronica gives a \u2013 mostly fictional \u2013 parody of the precise\nand hallowed science of marking lab reports\nThe Tale of the Demonstrator\nT\nHe picks up\na book, flicks\nto a random\npage and\nreads the first\nnumber he\nsees: it is odd.\nB it is then for\nthis report\n\n"

On Albertopolis\nTim Arbabzadah talks to ex-Imperial student and TEDx organiser\nKadhim Shubber about organising TEDxAlbertopolis\nJob Description\nSondrel is looking for new or recent graduates who are interested in pursuing a career in\nmicroelectronics. The current roles will provide the candidates with training from some of\nSondrel's highly skilled engineers in a variety of disciplines across IC design.

Sondrel won the Queens Award for Enterprise 2009.\nAdditional Information\nType:\nFull-time\nExperience:\nEntry level\nFunctions:\nEngineering, Management\nIndustries:\nSemiconductors\nCompensation:\nCompetitive\nEDxImperialCollege was\na must see event. It had so\nmuch on o\ufb00er (you even\ngot your own lanyard) and\nmust have hit home with\nthe audience: it was trending on Twitter. Considering it contained absolutely zero Justin Bieber performances,\nthat\u2019s pretty special. Former Felix Editor/physics student Kadhim Shubber\nkindly took some time out to answer\nsome questions. He is co-organising\npossibly one of the largest ever TEDx\nevents, right on our doorsteps at the\nRoyal Albert Hall. he team organising TEDxAlbertopolis is almost entirely made up of Imperial alumni, and\nKadhim described them as \u201ca dream.\nhe most intelligent, interesting and\ne\ufb00ective people you could hope to\nwork with.\u201d\nTim Arbabzadah: You organised\nTEDxImperialCollege, what made\nyou want to organise another TEDx\nevent?\nKadhim Shubber: We had far more\npeople who wanted to attend TEDxImperialCollege than we could ac-commodate. here was such a huge\ndemand in this community for another\nTEDx event and we felt that there was\nmore to say, and more stories to explore in this area.\nTA: If there were anything you could\nhave done di\ufb00erently at the last\nevent, what would it have been?\nKS: When you organise an event, you\nare in a unique position to see all the\nniggles and \ufb02aws. here are lots of\nthings that I thought could have been\na little bit better, but on the whole I\nthink it was a great event that people\nenjoyed and I wouldn\u2019t want to point\nto one thing or another.\nTA: he Royal Albert Hall is the ven-ue, how did that idea come about?\nKS: he Royal Albert Hall is Albertopolis\u2019 auditorium. Its full name is the\n\u201cRoyal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences\u201d, making it the perfect place to explore the Arts, Sciences and their role\nin modern society. We are incredibly\nlucky to be able to organise TEDxAlbertopolis at the Royal Albert Hall.\nTA:Is this the biggest ever TEDx\nevent?\nKS: I don\u2019t know, but I haven\u2019t heard\nof any that are bigger. TEDx events are\nabout spreading ideas and connecting\npeople. he size isn\u2019t hugely important.\nTA: It\u2019s TEDxAlbertopolis. What is\nAlbertopolis?\nKS: Albertopolis is the informal name\nfor the area from the Royal Albert Hall\ndown to South Kensington station,\nincluding all the museums and other\ninstitutions in this neighbourhood.\nIt\u2019s basically a Victorian \u201cTech City\u201d,\nfounded on the pro\ufb01ts of he Great\nExhibition of 1851 as a place where\nscienti\ufb01c innovation and creative design work hand in hand.\nTA: What is the theme of this year\u2019s\nevent?\nKS: We aren\u2019t giving away the theme\njust yet, but it\u2019s no secret that we\u2019ll focus on the place how art and science \ufb01t\ntogether in the modern world.\nTA: Are there any big name speakers\nwe will get to see?\nKS: We\u2019ve chosen all of our speakers because we think they have a really interesting perspective to share\nand a compelling story to tell. We\u2019ve\ngot many more to announce, but\nwe\u2019ve already announced Dame Sally\nDavies, the Chief Medical O\ufb03cer for\nEngland and Emeritus Professor at\nImperial; David Braben FREng, CEO\nof the Frontier Developments and a\ncofounder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation; Nicholas McCarthy, the \ufb01rst\none-handed pianist graduate from\nthe Royal College of Music; and John\nHalpern, cryptic crossword setter for\nhe Guardian, he Times, The Financial Times and he Telegraph.\nTA: Who would be your dream\nspeaker to invite?\nKS: I feel incredibly privileged to be\nworking with the speakers we\u2019ve already been able to announce. I think\nthis is pretty much a dream line-up. (I\nhope you agree!)\nTEDxAlbertopolis is on the 23rd\nSeptember, tickets can be bought\nby going to roy-alalberthall.com.\nFind out more at\nTEDxAlbertopolis.com\nWith all the attention focusing on the Royal Albert\nHall\u2019s starring role in TEDxAlbertopolis, it\u2019s worth\nreturning to the humble beginnings leading up to\nthis event. Held on the 24th of March in the distinct\nenvirons of the Great Hall, TEDxImperialCollege invited a range of speakers to deliver lectures on the\ntheme of the Great Exhibition of 1851. Topics of the\nday included instant spray-on fabric and a project to\nresurrect the world\u2019s first modern computer, with the\nsubjects proving wholly memorable \u2013 for the world\nand not just for those attending with some of these\ntalks reaching thousands via the modern day magic\nof YouTube.\nI was lucky enough to be seated on the reputable\nSocial Media Sofa at the back of the auditorium, providing just about the best view of the action going on\nbelow. Live blogging proved a just about surmountable challenge, with the sheer number of eminently\nquotable ideas and concepts from eminently quotable individuals arriving like a swarm of commuters\nat a busy station, clashing at the ticket barrier of my\nlive update system.\nI\u2019m under the distinct impression that even more\ncan be expected from the upcoming event at the Royal Albert Hall. And though obviously things won\u2019t be\nthe same without the Social Media Sofa in the back,\nI\u2019m sure that the range of speakers and incredible location will lead this to be an event that will inspire\nan incredible amount of attention; not least plenty of\ntrending on Twitter.\nMatt Colvin\nA Great Exhibition\nT\n\n"

    "content": "Let\u2019s Talk About Homestuck\nMaciej Matuszewski looks at a truely innovative webcomic\nI am an avid follower of many webcomics \u2013 both of those with standalone strips and those with longer\nrunning storylines. I have, however,\nfound that for the most part, apart\nfrom the means of distribution, they\ndon\u2019t di\ufb00er all that much from their\nprint counterparts. Despite the many\ncreators out there producing brilliant\nwork, there are very few who have\nattempted to utilise the internet as a\ncreative medium to its full potential.\nOne of the few who, in my opinion,\nhas, is Andrew Hussie, creator of\nHomestuck.\nFrom its \ufb01rst pages Homestuck appears to be fairly standard fare. he\n\ufb01rst page introduces us to one of our\nprotagonists \u2013 John Egbert \u2013 as he eagerly awaits the arrival of a birthday\npresent \u2013 the beta version of a Simslike game called Sburb. he artwork is\nsimple \u2013 some might even say crude\n\u2013 and the story is told mainly through\nchat logs of the protagonists\u2019 instant\nmessenger conversations. It isn\u2019t long,\nhowever, before the comic\u2019s more experimental and, shall we say, eccentric qualities begin to manifest them-selves. Much of the early storyline was\nheavily based on reader\u2019s suggestions,\nwhich, combined with Hussie\u2019s own\nbrand of highly anarchic humour\nmeans that there is nothing that is too\nbizarre for this webcomic.\nIt is di\ufb03cult to give even a bare\noutline of the plot. Coming in at over\n6000 pages, and almost 100,000 words\nBOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 07 JUNE\n12\nlonger than War and Peace, this certainly isn\u2019t a quick read. It is also one\nof the densest and most convoluted\nstories that I have ever read. here are\ndozens of primary characters, the story is heavily reliant on time travel and\nthe action takes place in at least four\ndi\ufb00erent alternate universes. hat\u2019s\nnot to mention the numerous fourth\nwall breaks and moments of author in-sertion. While in other works I might\nbe tempted to call all of this gimmicky and excessive, in Homestuck it\nall comes together to work incredibly\nwell. PBS has compared Homestuck to\nJames Joyce\u2019s Ulyssees, in how, while\nat times seemingly impenetrable, it\nis still deeply rewarding. Hussie is a\nhighly skilled writer and manages to\nuse this complexity to create a story\nthat is not deep, engrossing, funny\nand \ufb01lled with engaging characters\nbut also one that is unlike anything\nthat you have ever seen before.\nAll of this is helped by how Hussie is not afraid to play with his me-dium. here is often experimentation with new art styles and from\nthe very beginning heavy use was\nmade of animated gif panels. Later\non these evolved into minutes long\n\ufb02ash animations (Homestuck currently includes over three hours of\nfull animation) and even short interactive games. here have been some\n25 o\ufb03cial music albums inspired by\nthe comic and Hussie is currently\nworking on a full adventure game set\nin the same universe as the comic \u2013\nthe Kickstarter for which raised over\nthree times its $700,000 target.\nI will admit that this certainly won\u2019t\nbe everyone\u2019s cup of tea. It requires a\nsubstantial investment of time to get\ninto and some might, perhaps quite\nrightly, view it as pretentious and full\nof itself. It is, however, something\ncompletely unique and I believe that it\ndeserves praise for that if for nothing\nelse. he comic is currently on hiatus while Hussie works on the aforementioned game so this is the perfect\nchance to catch up.\nHomestuck, along with Hussie\u2019s earlier\nwork, may be read for free at mspain-tadventures.com .\n\n"

Or\ncontrol giants that can\nin\ufb02uence the planet on a\nlarge scale? \u201cDammit, ocean giant, I\nsaid one space to the left!\u201d Okay, command giants; they\u2019re a bit imprecise.\n\u201cCome back forest giant, I need you\nover here!\u201d he silly things. Anyway,\nforget Black & White, four giants is\nmuch more fun than one creature that\ndoesn\u2019t even have complete control\nover the topography!\nReus is a god/puzzle game in which\nyou must use your four giants (Swamp,\nForest, Mountain and Ocean) to in\ufb02uence the ecosystem enough to create\nhuman life on your surface \u2013 since\nyou\u2019re the planet, for some reason. By\nhelping the humans complete their\nprojects you may impress them enough\nfor them to send your giants ambas-sadors, which will increase their pow-ers. However, you must be wary; if the\nhumans get too greedy they may wage\nwar against each other, or even start attacking your giants!\nhe gameplay is quite simple. he\ngiants each have a major power which\nwill change the landscape (creating\nwhatever environment they are named\nafter), and creating mountains and\noceans in\ufb02uences the terrain to either\nside as well, in\ufb02uencing what type of\nsettlement is formed and therefore\nwhat types of projects the settlement\nwill try to undertake. In addition to\nthis, each giant can place both objects\n(minerals, plants, animals) onto the\nsurface and aspects onto objects.\nWhere things start getting more\ncomplicated is the interaction between these objects. Each object has\none or more synergies which activate\nif a certain condition is met, which can\nlead to situations where simple objects\nproduce more resources than more\nadvanced ones. Successfully taking advantage of these synergies is the key to\nunlocking the more di\ufb03cult projects.\nhe overall goal of the game is to unlock all the achievements. It is played\nout in games ranging from half an hour\nto two hours long (you can, of course,\npause or save at any time) in which you\ntry to develop humans in the right way\nto unlock the remaining achievements,\nthus allowing humans to try harder\nprojects in later games.\nhe game as a whole is a lot of fun in\nthe early stages, but can get tedious if\nyou\u2019ve played it a lot. Trying to get the\nright combination of synergies to complete harder projects can be a real pain,\nas often the resources required are so\nhigh that you must completely redesign everything within the settlement\nborders in order to ensure that they get\nenough resources.\nhis is augmented not only by the\ncooldown on giant powers, but also by\nthe fact that resources that have been\nnewly built do not get used immedi-ately. hey must become \u2018in use\u2019, which\ntakes a little while. Projects always require resources in use and so this non-immediate use can really be annoying\nin certain situations!\nOverall, this is a very enjoyable game,\nattempting to unlock as many new\nsynergies and objects as possible, and\noccasionally just helping a settlement\nwipe out everyone else for the hell of\nit! It can also be surprisingly fun to\nsimply watch the people in one of your\nsettlements talk about stu\ufb00 \u2013 inventing\nyour own conversations for the symbols that come up in their speech bub-bles. But don\u2019t be surprised if it doesn\u2019t\nlast you a long time, unless you\u2019re the\nkind of person that really gets into puzzle games.

Is it really that time again?\nAnother year, another smorgasbord of games and games-related... stuff.

Glancing down at\nthe ground he spotted his spear lying\nthere lifelessly, the once golden weapon\nhad now turned a dull shade of copper.\n\u201cBut still, what\u2019s it all worth now?\nLook at this place, it\u2019s in ruins! I\u2019d rather be in Eden \u2014 even after Eve ate that\ndamn apple!\u201d\nAres was right. Olympus was a mess.\nThe once crystal blue waters that had\nrun through the Acropolis were now a\nmisty grey and the fountains that had\nonce showered the lush fields were\nbarely able to form a dribble. Hera remembered how the grass had once been\nso vibrant and green that even Yaweh\nhad commented on it. \u201cThe grass is\nalways greener on the other side,\u201d she\nhad sneered. Of course, Hera knew very\nwell that it wasn\u2019t, nobody\u2019s grass was\nas green as theirs. But those days had\nlong passed, now the grass was patchy\nand in some places wilted. Mother Nature had far better gardens to tend to.\nAres looked up at the dilapidated columns and sighed. \u201cThey used to reach so\nhigh you couldn\u2019t even see where they\nended. I remember racing Hermes to the\ntop \u2014 of course he cheated and used his\nsandals.\u201d\n\u201cHa! I remember that day. You kids\nwere always up to mischief.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he up to now, mother? I\nhaven\u2019t seen my dear brother in centuries.\u201d\n\u201cWell you know what Maia and those\nPleiades whores are like, his mother\nnever gave him the guidance he de-served. I heard he travelled East, got\nhimself involved with Vishnu\u2019s lot.\nThey have so many deities over there\nthat he was able to slip in without anyone really noticing. I\u2019ve even heard he\u2019s\nhaving an affair with one of the Devas.\nI\u2019m happy for him.\u201d\nHera paused for a second, and pondered about what it would be like to\nmove away herself, start afresh, meet\nsomeone new and fall in love all over\nagain. The thought excited her, but then\ncame that same old realisation, here she\nwas Queen \u2014 if she left she would be\na nobody.\n\u201cNow that Hermes has gone, poor Hades has nobody to guide all the souls to\nthe Underworld,\u201d she continued, trying\nto distract herself. \u201cAlthough it seems\nthat few want to go there nowadays,\nmost are heading to that dreaded place\nSatan calls his home. Have you been?\nIt\u2019s vile! The flames aren\u2019t properly\nlooked after and they don\u2019t even allow\npets in, poor Cerberus had to wait outside when we visited.\u201d\n\u201cHades was so upset when we left,\u201d\nshe sighed \u201cNot because he couldn\u2019t afford all the glamour, flashing lights and\nbohemian lifestyle that Hell offered \u2014\nhe was never into that kind of d\u00e9cor, he\npreferred the more traditional haunted\nlook he gave the Underworld. No, it\nwas the sheer volume of people that\nsaddened him. Back in the Golden Age,\nHades always had first pick of the most\ninteresting people, he was so down with\npop culture.\n\u201cEven when Cerberus did that trick\nwhere he licks him with all three\ntongues at once it still didn\u2019t cheer him\nup. I think\u2026 I think I may have even\nseen him shed a tear for the first time.\u201dA\nhigh pitch squeal escaped her lips as she\nstruggled to contain herself.\nAres stood up and rushed over to his\nmother, his bronze armour squeaking\nlike a rusty bicycle chain. He wrapped\nhis arms around her, squeezing them\ntightly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry mother, I\u2019m still here for\nyou.\u201d\nThese past couple of millennia had\nbeen hard, so many had deserted their\nranks. But they couldn\u2019t leave. They\nruled Olympus. If they left what would\nthere be?\n\u201cWe are strong,\u201d Zeus had reminded\nthem. \u201cWe have beaten our forefathers\nand we will rise again\u201d \u2014 he just needed\nto think up a plan. Centuries had passed\nand he had yet to formulate one.\n\u201cOh, we were so happy back then,\u201d\nsobbed Hera. She remembered sitting\nby Zeus\u2019 side. He was the man of her\ndreams, so strong and wonderful, her\nlover and her own brother! All those\nsoppy humans had worshipped them un-conditionally.\nHow things had changed. Zeus\u2019 once\nresplendent white beard was now straggly and grey. Hera wasn\u2019t one to talk\neither, her once soft skin had grown so\nhard and cracked that she had gone as\nfar as removing all the mirrors from\nher room. Yet, the thought of Athena\u2019s\nwords provided her with solace:\n\u2018To earn their faith we must first have\nfaith in ourselves.\u2019\n\u201cHey look on the bright side, at least\nwe\u2019re not in Valhalla!\u201d Ares exulted.\nHera chuckled and a smile formed on\nher face again.\n\u201cI hear Valhalla is so empty nowadays\nyou could mistake Odin for one of the\nstatues! You know, apparently they\u2019re\nso short on Valkyries, that they\u2019ve even\nbegun accepting cross-dressers!\u201d\nTheir laughter filled the air \u2014 laughter was always the best medicine.\n\u201cI love you son,\u201d she said smiling. \u201cAt\nleast we still have each other.\u201d\n\u201cLove you too mother \u2014 yeah, at least\nwe\u2019ll always have that!\u201d\nPHOENIX\n28 29\nPHOENIX\nBack in the Golden Age, Hades\nalways had first pick of the most\ninteresting people, he was so down\nwith pop culture...\n\u201d\n\u201c\n\n"

But then he sees her clicking\naway at a typewriter. he incredible\nspeed at which she types, even when\nshe\u2019s only using her index \ufb01ngers, is\nsomething Louis notices instantly,\nand he decides he can do something\nwith her amazing talent. And so after a brief misunderstanding where\nshe assumes he wants sex out of her,\nbegins their hardcore training for a\nspeed typing competition. She \ufb01rst\nneeds to use all her ten \ufb01ngers cor-rectly, and then she\u2019s given numerous\nclassic novels to type out word for\nword.\nIt boasts a wacky, farce-like prem-ise, every bit as eccentric as the best\nFrench comedies, and with its e\ufb00ective period mood, and light colourful touches here and there, the \ufb01lm\nis incredibly successful in setting\nthis up as an entirely believable and\nconvincing scenario. It\u2019s incredibly\nentertaining, and never before has\nspeed typing been seriously seen as\nPurging all of that useless\nknowledge after exams\na competitive sport. When the various \u201craces\u201d get going, the regional,\nnational, and eventually the international one, they are as tense as any\nrace you can imagine. he thundering noise as the women furiously\npress down on their typewriters\u2019 key-boards, the surprisingly large crowd\ncheering and roaring their endless\nsupport, the sliding of every typewriter as they \ufb01nish a line, and the\nchanging over of the bits of paper, it\u2019s\non a much bigger scale than what\u2019s\noriginally anticipated. It\u2019s clearly a\nbig deal in the Populaire universe,\nand the audience has no difficulty going along with the craze.\nWhat \ufb01nally happens between\nthe two leads is hardly an element\nof surprise, nor is the overall result of the competitions. Fran\u00e7ois\nand Duris have a natural charming\nchemistry, and their sugary-sweet\ndynamic is a part of what makes this\nhighly watchable. Duris, as likable\nand amusing as ever with his icy cold\nexterior although actually warm and\nfrothy inside, provides the perfect\ncounterpart for Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 clumsy,\nquirky and adorable village girl. he\nprocess of developing their romance\ncleverly touches on some more serious issues using its supporting cast\nto make the most of the well-rounded\nensemble. he Artist\u2019s B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo\ntakes on the most prominent subplot,\nas Louis\u2019 childhood sweetheart who\nmay or may not have had something\nbetween them. World War II and\nits aftermath is also an issue talked\nabout here, something that further\nenriches the characters here.\nAlthough everything is very well\ndressed up to look grand, pretty and\nperfect, the \ufb01lm is not afraid to hint\nat various underlying sadness and\nchallenges each character needs to\novercome to make their relationship\nwork. For her, there\u2019s the quickly\ngrowing fame that surrounds her tal-ent, one that gradually steals her away\nfrom having a normal life. Whereas\nfor him, he has pressure from his\nfamily to be a better, more cut-throat\nand successful businessman, as well\nas trouble opening up his feelings.\nSwitching comfortably back and\nforth between well-measured comedy as well as engaging human drama\nthat nicely strike a balance, here is\nan easily enjoyable, highly rewarding feel-good movie experience that\ndeals with the most unexpected\n\u201csport\u201d. And for anyone who wants\nto argue that this isn\u2019t a proper event,\nwatch and experience the sheer raw\nintensity involved with what goes\ninto the world of speed-typing.\nWill this truly be \u201cthe last\u201d?\nJohn Park Film Editor\nThe Last Exorcism Part II\nDirector: Ed Gass-Donnelly\nScreenwriters: Damien Chazelle, Ed\nGass-Donnelly\nStarring: Ashley Bell, Julia Garner,\nSpencer Treat Clark\nhe last Last Exorcism certainly was\nnot the \u201clast\u201d as it is followed by\nthis pretty disastrous sequel that is\nsomehow trying to bridge a gap for\na potential third entry to turn the\nfranchise into a trilogy \u2013 because\nany mildly successful horror series\nmust at least have three.\nOnce again we have the same girl\nwho\u2019s being pursued by a relentless\ndemon that is determined to possess an innocent, pure body so that\nit can have its wicked, supernatural\nways. Yes, Nell (Bell) is having difficulties running away from her troubled past, in which she was forced\ninto a part of a creepy satanic cult\nthat ended with a botched exorcism\n(aren\u2019t they always?) followed by a\ntwisted, demented birthing ceremony in the middle of a huge bon\ufb01re.\nEnding with a cli\ufb00hanger (always a\nsafe choice), we thought we would\nnever have to hear from them again,\nputting a sensible \ufb01nish to a surprisingly good horror \ufb01lm.\nAnd yet trying to milk the franchise for as much cash as possible,\nhere\u2019s the sequel, in which very little\nhappens, and one that is frustrat-ingly toned down when it comes to\nthe shock factor. Having moved into\na home for lost/traumatised girls (all\nof them automatically turning into a\nlong list of victims), Nell is settling\nin working away diligently as a hotel\nchambermaid although it\u2019s not long\nuntil the usual frightening occurrences start haunting her. You know,\nthe usual bumpy things, twisty body\ncontortion movements, frothy sei-zures, demonic voices, weird eye\ncolouring/movements etc.\nhe \ufb01rst instalment was an excellent use of the handheld-camera\ntechnique, but with this follow-up,\nthe style is completely gone and\nlost, falling back to the old standard\nway of \ufb01lming without ever providing something else for the audience\nto enjoy. he scares are all very generic and a lot of them without much\nmemorable impact. here are a few\ne\ufb00ective moments, ones that really\nought to have been present more\nconsistently throughout.\nIt\u2019s unclear to see just where the\n\ufb01lm is headed and when it does end\nup in its big \ufb01nal showdown, (yes,\nyet another botched exorcism, what\nelse?) you\u2019re in for a big disappoint-ment. As a complete unimaginative\nrehash minus the stylistic push, it all\nfeels tedious and repetitive, one you\nwouldn\u2019t feel like enduring. It\u2019s no\nfun when there\u2019s a complete lack of\nmystery as to what is happening \u2013 as\nfrom the previous \ufb01lm we\u2019ve learned\nall there is to know about this omnipotent evil force.\nBell doesn\u2019t seem to have any dif\ufb01culty slipping back into her breakout role, although everyone else\naround her stands around rather\nawkwardly equipped only with their\nclunky dialogue to fend for them-selves. Bell\u2019s purely innocent and\ncompletely clueless nature is always\nfun to watch as we sense that she\u2019s\nbeen marked for all sorts of bad\nthings even from the very start. As\nNell completely falls apart thanks\nto the demon, this gives Bell a real\nchance to show o\ufb00 her talent and she\nshows that she really belongs in better \ufb01lms.\nPerhaps if another sequel is given\nthe go-ahead signal, it will allow the\nfranchise a chance to stir things up\nand go all-out for a truly shocking\n\ufb01nish. After all, this Part II ends on\na cli\ufb00hanger with much potential,\none that could surely be developed\nfurther, venturing into more daring territory that might certainly be\nworth a look, unlike this dull, pedestrian piece of work.\n\n"

Plus it\u2019s an extra\nbonus point to not have to endure a\ncring inducing love subplot between\nan immortal and mortal \u2013 what we\nget here is something entirely di\ufb00erent \u2013 a more patient, slow-burning\napproach to telling a familiar but not\nat all predictable story of supernatural beings we can\u2019t ever stop hearing\nabout no matter what.\nEleanor (Ronan) is sixteen forever.\nShe\u2019s a vampire, and is not allowed to\ndiscuss with anyone her little secret \u2013\nher mother Clara (Arterton) forbids\nthis. So she must settle for writing\ndown her thoughts and feelings as\nmany diary entries, throwing them\naway into the wind or the sea. For reasons unknown to her, Ella and Clara\nare constantly on the run. Whilst\nproviding the best for her daughter in\nthe only way she knows how, by pleasing men, Clara is a loyal although at\ntimes, \ufb02awed protector, as with any\nparent.\nTurns out the only reason these\ntwo are the most wanted vampires is\nbecause they\u2019re female. he vampire\nsociety puts a lot of importance on\nthe word \u201cbrotherhood\u201d and allows\nno women into their group. Since\nClara and Eleanor were both created\nagainst the rules, they need to be\nremoved. his explains Clara\u2019s para-noia, and the need to isolate themselves wherever they go, whereas with\nEleanor, who is kept in the dark about\nmost of this, doesn\u2019t understand.\nFor the past couple of centuries, Eleanor seems to have been a good, disciplined girl. Now she\u2019s \ufb01nally getting\nthe courage to stand up for herself\nand rebel (and about time, too). She\nmeets a boy, joins some college class-es, and soon the secrets start spilling\nthemselves. And as she tells her story,\nwe are shown, in many \ufb02ashback se-quences, just how everything came\nabout.\nDirector Neil Jordan takes his time\nto give us the full picture \u2013 he knows\nhow much to tell when, and more im-portantly, he knows when to make the\ncuts \u2013 leaving the narrative hanging.\nHe doesn\u2019t give anything away too\neasily, and with this air of mystery\nand intrigue, this becomes a vampire\n\ufb01lm that\u2019s far more entertaining and\nsmarter than the norm. he two parallel plot-lines here serve to further\nthe two females\u2019 nature.\nArterton is absolutely spot-on as\nClara; and winding the clock back\nto the 19th Century, we see the long,\ncomplicated and painful process she\nhad to endure to end up where she is\nnow \u2013 and even as an immortal she\u2019s\nfailed to \ufb01nd peace. Arterton is loud,\nforceful and assertive, and has no\nproblem tapping into the seductive\nside of her role given some very suggestive items of clothing she wears.\nBut underneath all the con\ufb01dence\nand tough exterior, there\u2019s an obvious\ninner layer of weakness and vulnera-bility. With no allies she is on her own\nto look out for her family. Very little\nkindness was shown to her all her life,\nso we understand her need for utmost\ncontrol.\nIn contrast to her mother, Eleanor\nis a quieter, more restrained presence\non the screen, one that Ronan captures beautifully. She\u2019s sheltered and\nna\u00efve, qualities that make her bud-ding, awkward romance with Frank\n(Caleb Landry Jones \u2013 who looks so\npale he could well be a vampire him-self) all the more sweet and charm-ing. Over the years she too has found\nher speci\ufb01c ways to cope with her\nneed for feeding, one that involves a\nmore humane, sensitive approach. It\u2019s\nfascinating to navigate in their world,\nwhere vampires are incredibly similar\nto humans and really not a lot sets\nthem apart.\nhere are several under-developed\ncharacters as the \ufb01lm is interested\nsolely in Arterton and Ronan. Sam\nRiley in particular deserves more\nscreen time given his signi\ufb01cance to\nthe overall plot, and his participation\ncould have been enhanced for a more\nexciting \ufb01nale that disappointingly\nends on a bit of a \ufb02at note. Jonny Lee\nMiller lends his talent to play the vile\nantagonist, whereas Daniel Mays puts\nin an appearance to add a touch of\ncomedy to the otherwise overall serious tone.\nBecause of its overall glum tone as\nwell as its slow-burning approach to\ntell its dense story, there will be limited appeal to young adults looking\nfor a quick action \ufb01x. In fact there is\nvery little in the way of fast, kinetic\nshowdowns, but the \ufb01lm more than\nmakes up for this in its unique way of\nportraying its vampires.\nThe same meal every\nsingle day must get boring\nI\u2019m so tired of drinking\nthe same thing every day. I\nmiss tea, oh, and cocktails\nWas the answer 15 or\n14. I can\u2019t remember\n\n"

I often hear discussions of how noise music and\nambient music are two extremes of\nthe same scale, and are just di\ufb00erent\nmanifestations of the same musical\naim. his can be heard throughout\nthis album; there are moments of full-blown PITA style glitch \u2013 never rhyth-mic, always droning \u2013 over prolonged,\ndistorted guitar tones followed by am-bient, somewhat soothing passages.\nhis contrast is most prominent in\nthe moments where there are some\nsounds pushing the machinery to its\nlimit (as mentioned above) whilst, si-multaneously, others could have been\npulled from music written by Steve\nRoach on a bad acid trip.\nhese sections \ufb02ow into each other\ncontinually and smoothly, somewhat\naided by always holding one instrument at a lower level; no matter how\nmuch the guitar or electronics are\nscreaming, there is almost always\nsome softer, ambient slow textures\nhappening underneath the top-level\nintensity. his makes the noise more\naccessible, having a soft melody underneath the abrasion that can easily be grabbed onto. It reminds me of\nPrurient\u2019s use of piano and strings\nunderneath crushing noise, adding an\nelement of euphoria to the piece.\nIt is di\ufb03cult to get through a description of this album without drawing comparison to Rehberg\u2019s work\nwith Stephen O\u2019Malley as KTL, especially as upon holding the physical\nrelease you immediately see that the\nminimalistic artwork is credited to\nO\u2019Malley. Licht opens with menacing\nguitar and bass drones and these continue fairly steadily throughout, varying from nearly Sunn O)))-level deep\nresonation to barely detectable whispers in the ambient sections.\nIt strikes me as somewhat odd that\nsome of the elements that seem to have\ncarried over from KTL would, you\u2019d\nthink, have been due to O\u2019Malley\u2019s\nwork. hat said, a hefty amount of the\nsoft electronic fuzz borrows heavily\nfrom Rehberg\u2019s earlier work and the\nproli\ufb01c output of Editions Mego.\nDespite the inherent euphoria held\nin some parts of the album (especially\nthe parts most informed by Mego), it\nis fairly dark and ominous through the dura-tion; the quieter moments where one might\nbegin to take on an optimistic mood are crept\nupon by foreboding, uneasy sounds, as is implemented particularly well\nin \u2018Still\u2019. Reviewing this\non a sunny summer day\ninstead of huddled over\nin a depressed hump in\nthe dead of winter feels\nlike somewhat of an insult to the work, but it\ndoes make for prime late\nnight staying at home\nmusic.\nhere\u2019s a remarkably diverse range\nof timbres to be found within Licht\nand I may have undersold this by just\nfocusing on the parts that grabbed me\nmost; whilst the work remains thematically related throughout, this is\nnot achieved via consistently using the\nsame sounds, but rather through the\nfull incorporation of this threatening\nundertone at all times. hat is perhaps\nthe most important way this stunning\ndebut manages to keep an air of unease and discomfort at all times; the\nconstant threat of something worse.\nhis album is yet another triumph for\nthe already incredibly strong set of\nBlackest Ever Black releases this year,\nfurther emphasising their reputation\nfor being able to \ufb01nd some of the most\nchilling music out there.\nBESURENOTTOMISS\nScanner opens a collection of sound\ninstallations inspired by John Dowland\u2019s \u2018Lachrimae\u2019. He will be joined\nby purveyor of orchestral doom and\nmulti-instrumentalist Bobby Krlic\n(The Haxan Cloak), who will be\npresenting a new piece of music also\ndrawing heavily from \u2018Lachrimae\u2019, as\nwell as some works from his 2013 album Excavation.\nI\u2019ll be jumping on the chance to\nsee an original work performed live\nby The Haxan Cloak; especially at\n\u00a35 for students. The night also features inventive audiovisual installation from The Computer Junk OrAmbarchi provides a solo live performance with a twist at Cafe Oto.\nHe presents \u2018Knots\u2019 the epic centerpiece of last year\u2019s Audience Of One\nalong with frequent collaborator Joe\nTalia on drums and a large ensemble that includes James Rushford on\ncello among many other performers.\nhe 30-minute-plus piece builds and\ndecays through various themes and\nits interpretation by a large ensemble\npromises to provide some interesting moments. If all that isn\u2019t enough,\nthere\u2019s also the premiere live performance from Mark Harwood\u2019s Astor\nproject.\nFabric and Red Bull Music Academy team up to bring the Infamous\nmasked New York rapper DOOM\nback to the UK, in a live showcasing of\nthe JJ Doom project with Jneiro Jarel\non hursday following the release of\ntheir critically acclaimed debut album,\nKey To The Ku\ufb00s last year.\nHeavy support provided by everyone\u2019s favourite Californian exile and\nprominent Dublab member Kutmah,\nalongside wonky hip-hop UK native\nBambooman, who has been part of\na recent movement to move found\nsound and \ufb01eld recording into more\ndance-\ufb02oor friendly material.\nReleased on Mike Patton\u2019s Ipecac\nlabel, Palms sees 3 members of Isis\njoin Chino Moreno of Deftones fame,\nmaking an album whose sound is\nsomewhere between the two. Where\nAaron Turner\u2019s inscrutable vocals on\nesoteric, often philosophical topics\n(Panopticon) or abstract concept albums (Oceanic) gave Isis an ethereal\nquality, Palms has the more clear-cut\nand emotive singing of Chino Moreno.\nIt appears that the delivery of the\nIsis members has taken a bit of a page\nfrom Deftones and in doing so creates\nsomething unique in the back catalogues of either group.\nTo put it more plainly, the album\nhas roots in the past materials of both\nIsis and Deftones, but brings both into\nnew ground. It could then be that this\nalbum has appeal to both fans of Isis\nand Deftones, as well as people who\nare unfamiliar with either.\nSpeci\ufb01c highs include the album\nender \u2018Antarctic Handshake,\u2019 which\nis an epic musical journey lasting almost ten minutes. Perhaps this choice\nshows my assessment of the album, as\nthis work would comfortably sit somewhere in the Isis discography. Like\nmany of their fans, I just really like Isis,\nand tracks like \u2018Antartic Handshake\u2019 or\n\u2018Shortwave Radio\u2019 deliver the interplay\nof drums, bass and guitar that characterized Isis. Sometimes dismissed as\nhipster metal, Isis\u2019 albums always received a large portion of critical rec-ognition, especially alongside many\ndiverse projects within post-metal.\nhis project, however, represents a\nmovement into rock territory.\nParticularly moments in tracks like\n\u2018Tropics\u2019 seem to be informed by a pop\nsensibility of sorts. As with any die\nhard fan of either band, extensive listening is required to appreciate Palms\nin spite of the greatness of old work.\nPalms takes the form of an emotive\nalbum where Moreno\u2019s vocals are the\nkey centerpiece, compared to being\ntreated as simply another instrument\nas in Isis. It does seem, however, that\nPalms is a great album in its own right.\nPalms\u2019 self titled debut comes out 26th\nJune on Ipecac Records\nAlbumReview:Palms\nRiaz Agahi Music Editor\nOren Ambarchi Presents\n\u2018Knots\u2019 with Strings\nCafe Oto\nWednesday\nScanner: he Haxan Cloak\nBishopsgate Institute\nSaturday\nJJ Doom\nFabric\nhursday\n\n"

I\u2019m convinced words were what rushed through\nher veins, often spilling out as a well put-together blog post, Felix\narticle or who knows what else. One memory which sticks is from an\necology lecture, where we were asked to think up of an analogy for\nscramble competition. On the spot, without a moment\u2019s hesitation,\nEmilie created a scene of women fighting in the Boxing Day sales.\nThis mistress of metaphor is sorely missed by oh-so-many and her\nsweet-kindness will not be forgotten.\u201d \u2013 J.

    "content": "Dr Dave Clements is an astrophysicist\nin Imperial\u2019s physics department and\nis involved in several ESA and NASA\nobservational projects including the\nPlanck mission. He also writes short\nfiction, and his hard science fiction stories have appeared in various publications including Analog Magazine and\nNature Futures (see story on page 14).\nPhoenix: Where do you get your\nideas, and are they inspired by your\nscience?\nDave Clements: Where you get your\nideas is one of the clich\u00e9 questions people get asked, especially if you\u2019re writing science fiction. The answer is, ideas\nare everywhere. It\u2019s not that people\nwriting science fiction are particularly\ngood at ideas \u2014 it\u2019s taking an idea, a\nconcept, and turning it into a story that\u2019s\nthe hard thing. Some of it is inspired by\nmy research, some of it isn\u2019t. So for ex-ample, there\u2019s a story I had published in\nAnalog that\u2019s set around a neutron star,\nI don\u2019t actually do any work on neutron\nstars but the basic concept of the story\ncame while I was sitting in a seminar\non neutron stars. But another one is the\nstory I had published in Nature, Last\nof The Guerilla Gardeners, that arose\nfrom an art-science collaboration with\nVanessa Harden from the Royal College of Art, who did an exhibit on guerilla gardening.\nP: Do you find that being a writer,\nbeing a creative person, affects the\nresearch you do?\nDC: Research is creative. The creative\nmuscles used in research and in writing\nare much the same, you\u2019re just pushing\nthem in a different direction, that\u2019s the\nway I feel it. You can say things in fiction that you can\u2019t say in research, and\nvice versa. I think one of the things\nthat motivates me, at least in the hard\nscience fiction that I write, is that I\u2019m\ntrying to put a human scale, or human\ninteraction into what I do research on.\nBecause I\u2019m an extragalactic astrono-mer, that makes putting it on a human\nscale rather difficult. But showing\nsomehow that the vast distances, the\nvast gulfs of time involved, comparing\nthose to a human span \u2014 that\u2019s what\nI try to do. And also, at some level,\nreflect the \u2014 how do I say it without\nsounding depressing? \u2014 the insignificance of us on cosmological scales.\nP: What inspired you to first start\nwriting?\nDC: Reading. I guess the first thing I\nwrote that could be described as science\nfiction was when I was about nine or ten\nat school. It\u2019s always been there in the\nbackground at some level. Sometimes it\ngets more attention, and now that I\u2019ve\ngot a reasonably secure position here,\nI\u2019m writing more.\nP: If you had the opportunity, would\nyou give up your day job to be a writer full-time?\nDC: I\u2019ve thought about that. In the unlikely event that I do get some level\nof success with novel-writing, I think\nI would still want some connection to\nthe real science. The two feed off each\nother, in my mind at least.\nP: Which writers do you most ad-mire, or aspire to be like?\nDC: Who I admire and who I\u2019d like to\nbe like are somewhat different ques-tions. There are writers out there, like\nWilliam Gibson, or China Mi\u00e9ville,\nSCIENCE MEETS LITERATURE\nDAVE CLEMENTS ON SCIENCE FICTION AND FACT\nResearch is creative.\nThe creative muscles\nused in research and\nwriting are much\nthe same, you\u2019re just\npushing them in a\ndifferent direction\n\u201c 21\nPHOENIX\n\n"

    "content": "PHOENIX\n32 33\nPHOENIX\nRYOTA ICHINOSE TALKS ABOUT HIS DOUBLE LIFE\nAT IMPERIAL AND THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF MUSIC\nRyota Ichinose is a violinist and a final year undergraduate on the 4-year\nBSc Physics and Music Performance\nprogramme, taught jointly by Imperial\nand the RCM. He told us about how he\nbalances two demanding disciplines in\nthe same time most of us take to study\none subject!\nPhoenix: So you\u2019re a student on the\njoint Physics and Music course at Imperial. That\u2019s quite an unusual combination to study. Can you tell me a\nbit about why you chose it?\nRyota Ichinose: Well, the violin has always been a big part of my life. I started\nplaying when I was five years old, and\nit helped me a lot as I grew up. For ex-ample, when I first came to England,\nwhen I was ten, I couldn\u2019t speak any\nEnglish. But when I played the violin, I\ncould get some respect from other peo-ple, I wasn\u2019t just this person who can\u2019t\nspeak English. So the violin\u2019s always\nbeen part of my life. In terms of phys-ics, I\u2019ve always excelled at physics during school, I really enjoyed it. So when\nI heard about this course, it just seemed\nperfect.\nP: Has it been difficult to find the time\nto devote to both music and physics?\nRI: To some extent, yes, because physics itself requires sole concentration, so\nwhen I\u2019m revising for physics exams I\ndon\u2019t practice much violin, and when\nI\u2019m preparing for a music exam I don\u2019t\ndo much physics. At the RCM [Royal\nCollege of Music], I have to compete\nwith people who study solely music,\nwho practice about 8 hours a day, and\nthat\u2019s something I just can\u2019t do because\nI don\u2019t have the time. So it is difficult,\nyes.\nP: Do you have any plans for when\nyou finish your degree? Do you want\nto continue with music, or physics, or\ntry to combine both somehow?\nRI: I\u2019m going on to a Masters next year,\nbut in nanotechnology, which is kind of\nunrelated to music. I chose it because\nof my final year project, which I really\nenjoyed. I do think it\u2019s a bit of a shame\nthat I won\u2019t actually be studying music any more, but I won\u2019t just quit the\nviolin. I\u2019ll try to join some orchestras,\nor maybe even organise some solo concerts if I can.\nP: Did you consider doing postgraduate studies in music?\nRI: Well, if you want to become a professional violinist, that requires a lot of\npractice, and despite the fact that I really enjoy playing the violin, and I actually enjoyed preparing for my last violin exams, I don\u2019t think I can live under\nthat kind of stress for my entire life. So\nno, perhaps not for me.\nP: Do you ever find it difficult to\nswitch between the very logical and\nanalytical kind of mindset you need\nfor physics, and the more expressive\nand creative musical side?\nRI: Yes, I find that I have difficulty in\ninteractions with friends at Imperial \u2014\nbecause their brains work so logically,\nsometimes I can\u2019t convey my musical\nand artistic thoughts to them. And it\u2019s\nactually vice versa with music. In music lessons, some of the things they say\nare more about feelings than logical\nthought processes, and how you can use\nmusic to convey those feelings. With\nphysics it\u2019s more about logical steps,\none after another. So they\u2019re very dif-ferent.\nP: Can you tell me a bit about the\ncourse, about how much time you\nspend on the different aspects of it?\nIs it about 50/50 between physics and\nmusic?\nRI: In the first year it was mainly phys-ics, but as you progress it gets to be\nmore and more music, and I believe this\nyear it\u2019s 70% music and 30% physics.\nIt\u2019s actually quite tough, because you\u2019re\nessentially doing two bachelor degrees\nat once. I complete all the usual physics\nmodules that a BSc student would do\nin three years, but for me it\u2019s four years\nbecause of the music. So time management is really key.\nP: So is it a good course? Would you\nrecommend it?\nRI: I\u2019d definitely recommend it. If\nyou\u2019re like me, if you work harder you\nfeel better about yourself afterwards.\nAnd you\u2019re developing your artistic and\nyour analytical mind at the same time,\nand I believe in the future that will help\nme in some ways. It gives you an edge\nbasically, because not many people\nhave that sort of background.\nP: It is quite unusual. Do you feel\nthere\u2019s any connection between the\ntwo things? Does being a musician\nmake you a better scientist in any\nway, or does being a scientist make\nyou approach your music different-ly?\nRI: I think there have been studies that\noften found that people who are good\nmusicians are also good mathemati-cians. But I haven\u2019t really thought\nabout it to any deep extent. But there\u2019s\nsome kind of connection there, maybe.\nP: Who\u2019s your favourite composer, or\nfavourite style of music?\nRI: Within the framework of the kind of\nclassical music you learn at the RCM,\nI\u2019d say I like the Romantic music the\nbest. I regard myself as quite an emotional guy, I like conveying my feelings\nwhen I\u2019m playing my violin, and I like\nit when other people do that too. So\nthat\u2019s why I find the modern stuff a bit\npretentious. But I listen to other kinds\nof music as well.\nP: Do you think Imperial\u2019s a good\nplace for people interested in arts and\nmusic? Do you think there\u2019s a good\ncommunity for that kind of thing?\nRI: If you regard music as a hobby, not\na profession, then Imperial provides a\ngood environment. You can have a lot\nof fun. There\u2019s a very good symphony\norchestra, which I\u2019m a part of, and I\nthink it\u2019s been rated as one of the top\nin the UK, some time ago. I think Imperial has the most societies out of any\nuniversities in the UK \u2014 there\u2019s lots of\nstuff going on!\n\u201d\n\u201c\nYou\u2019re developing\nyour artistic and your\nanalytical mind at\nthe same time, and I\nbelieve in the future\nthat will help me. It\ngives you an edge\nMUSIC\nMEETS\nPHYSICS\nshudder moments\nby J. Humphries\n\n"

Many an un-savoury moment of staring at a blank\npage must be endured. Given that\neach and every student here at Imperial College has to experience this on a\nrecurrent basis, this might rationalise\ndepleted student satisfaction.\nNumerous other scores inhibited the\noverall score of the College, including\nexpenditure per student head and a\nmeagre \u201cValue added\u201d score of 6.7/10\n(versus University of St. Andrews\u2019\nleading 8/10). his arguably is where\nscepticism begins to creep in among\nsta\ufb00 and students at the College; the\nscore takes people\u2019s grades before and\nafter university and sees if the university has \u2018added value\u2019 by improving the\nstudent\u2019s academic abilities. his has\nbecome a hot topic of debate before,\nwith many students arguing it could\nlead to grade inflation by universities.\nhis would raise the score by it looking\nas if the university had made the students perform better in assessments.\nhe general use of satisfaction by students has been controversial as to how\naccurate it is at measuring how good a\nCambridge still on top\nCambridge say they will now\nfight it out with the Klingons for\ngalactic domination\nRCC Awards announced\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief\nhe RCC have announced the winners\nof their awards. he RCC Club of the\nyear was Caving. here was also a Fellowsip for Alistair Cott.\nFour students got Distinguished\nService Awards. hey were: Matthew\nLees (Mountaineering), Timothy Runcorn (Ice Hockey) Antoine Desmet\n(Wakeboarding) Dominic-Andradi\nBrown (Underwater).\nThe following students received Colours: Thomas Wheeler (Exploration),\nLeon Vanstone (Kite Surfing), Thomas\nArscott (Gliding), Harish Santhanam\n(First Aid [LINKS]), Zhao Ming Tai\n(First Aid [LINKS]), Ruth Lawson\n(Mountaineering), Samuel Flynn (Gam-ing), Michelle Low (Mahjong).\nThe following received a Merit award: Joel Braganza-Mendes\n(Mountaineering),Tim Barrett (Night-Hike), Valentin Sauter (Fellwander-ers), Claire Guitton (Fellwanderers),\nEgor Kyshtymov (Gliding), Richard\nCameron (Underwater), Rhys Tyers\n(Caving), Johannes Hoenigl (Pilots),\nJennifer Norris (Dance), Delphine Rolando (Synchronized Swimming), Ryan\nPerkins (Outdoor).\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\nuniversity is.\nInspection of endowment does bring\nsome surprising results. As of July\n2012 the endowment of Imperial College London was in the region of \u00a379\nmillion. Contrast this with Oxford\u2019s\n\u00a33.7 billion endowment, viable of bailing out a small European Union state.\nCompare this furthermore with Harvard University\u2019s $30.4 billion endowment (around \u00a320 billion). It becomes\napparent that Imperial College London\nis punching above its weight, producing world class students and research\non a budget comparable to the spare\nchange in the pockets of some other\nacademic institutions. Couple this\nwith the ability of the College to attract\na multitude of highly-skilled students\nfrom overseas and perhaps the fortunes of Imperial are not all doom and\ngloom.\nhe league table by the Guardian\nmakes student satisfaction the centre-piece of the academic dinner table. It\nwould appear, from surveys for other\nleague tables (by the Times Higher\nEducation Supplement), that students\nthink that the fault of many Departments within the College is to su\ufb00ocate students with a massive academic\nworkload.\nInterestingly, the \u201cEntry Tari\ufb00\u201d for\nImperial was the third highest in the\ncountry. his is the UCAS points score\nthat students at the university achieve.\nAbove Imperial are Cambridge and\nOxford.\nhe Guardian also released their individual subject tables, showing what\nuniversity it considers the best for various subjects. he fortunes of the different subjects were extremely mixed.\nSome doing extremely poorly, and\nsome coming out on top. Earth and\nMarine Sciences was rated number one\nin the country, with 94% of students\nbeing in a career after six months.\nMechanical Engineering was also top,\nwith an average entry tari\ufb00 that stood\nhead and shoulders above the rest.\nCivil Engineering took second place,\nbehind UCL\u2019s equivalent. EEE, General\nEngineering (this speci\ufb01c course is not\no\ufb00ered at Imperial and so this is likely\nto be an amalgamation of the engineering subjects), Materials, and Chemical\nEngineering all came third. Physics\ncame \ufb01fth, with the percentage of students satis\ufb01ed with the feedback (64%)\nbeing the main distinguishing factor\nbetween Imperial and the other cours-es. Feedback again hit Mathematics,\nwho were seventh. Medicine came in\nninth and had the lowest score of all\nthe courses for feedback \u2013 with only\n47% saying they were happy. Although\nthis was better than King\u2019s College\nLondon, who managed to score an impressively poor 18%. Chemistry and\nBiosciences were the two worst performing at Imperial. Chemistry were\nin 12th, with satisfaction with teach-ing, feedback, and the course seemingly dragging down the rating. Biosciences performed the worst by quite\na margin: they came 25th in the subject\ntable. Again it appeared to be satisfaction that caused the problems.\nhe Guardian league tables are published yearly. Research performed by\neconomists at Royal Holloway found\nthat improving a Department\u2019s overall\nscore in the Guardian\u2019s league table\nwas linked with an increase in applica-tions. Studying the UCAS data and the\nleague tables published by the Guardian from 2004 onwards showed that\nan increase in the overall score by one\nstandard deviation saw an average 4.8%\nincrease in applications. his only applied to Departments at the top of the\ntable. he authors of the paper said:\n\u201cUniversities cannot a\ufb00ord to neglect\ntheir performance on league tables\nso long as they wish to establish and\nmaintain a consistent reputation to attract the best of students.\u201d\nStatistics can be found at: http://www.\nguardian.co.uk/education/table/2013/\njun/03/university-league-table-2014\n\n"

I turned\nthe corner and\nsaw a fleet of them parked outside her\nhouse, complete with sniffer dogs and a\nspace-suited forensic team heading for\nher potting shed.\nI averted my eyes and walked past\non the opposite side of the road, feeling\nthe envelope of illegal seeds in my pack\nLAST THE\nGUERILLA\nGARDENERS\nT PHOTOGRAPHY\nBY\nSARAH\nBYRNE\nby David L. Clements\nScientific sense\nwas never going\nto stand up to\nirate politicians\nshouting\n\u201cSomething must\nbe done!\u201d\n\u201c broadcast my guilt. As I left her road,\nthe sterilization van arrived, its flame\nthrowers ready to destroy \u2018Percy\u2019s\u2019 irreplaceable collection of plants.\nI got away. The others weren\u2019t so\nlucky.\nAs I waited for the bus I checked our\nsecure server and realized they were\nrolling up the whole network. \u2018Monty\u2019\nhad been the first, but in catapulting a\npackage of herb seeds into Buckingham\nPalace gardens he\u2019d gone too far. His arrest had been the trigger for raids across\nthe country. \u2018Bob\u2019 had sent out a warning as they smashed down his door, but\nthey\u2019d been ready for us all. If I hadn\u2019t\nbeen on a delivery run they\u2019d\u2019ve caught\nme as well.\nI couldn\u2019t go home. Most of the people I trusted had been picked up. I stayed\non the bus as it passed my stop and\nheaded into central London. The cleanup crews were obvious, torching collections of wild flowers in the roadside\nbeds that I\u2019d seeded from bus windows\nwhile commuting.\nAll the hard work, all the beautiful,\nirreplaceable diversity, stamped out by\ncommercial greed. If I\u2019d\u2019ve had the machinery with me I\u2019d\u2019ve leapt off the bus\nand seeded the palace gardens myself.\n\u2018Percy\u2019 had started the whole thing\nwith a few prophetic words:\n\u201cBiology is the biggest peer-to-peer\ncopying system on the planet. Now\nthey\u2019ve eliminated file sharing they\u2019ll\ncome for the seed sharers.\u201d\nShe\u2019d been a university botanist for\nyears but left when it became clear that\nall the grants were controlled by big ag-ribusiness. We knew we were in trouble\nwhen Kew was sold off and Henry Doubleday broken up. Their vast seed collections became the intellectual property\nof a few huge corporations. Unlicensed\nseeds were already illegal to sell, but\nonce companies owned the rare strains,\nthey stopped collectors sharing them for\nfree. They wanted to control it all.\nAt first we tried to stop them. There\nwere protests, lobbies and mass march-es. Gardener\u2019s Question Time became\nsuch a political hot potato it was cancelled by the BBC. And then came the\nChelsea Flower-Show Riots.\nWhen I got off the bus I saw the police\nat the station. But it was just the usual\npatrols, not yet a manhunt. Maybe word\nof my escape had yet to reach them. I\nheaded for Left Luggage.\nWe were called economic terror-ists, threatening profits from high-cost,\nhighyield, terminator-gene strains that\nwould feed the world and soak up excess CO2\n. But we just wanted tasty vegetables from our own gardens, unusual\nflowers smelling as good as they looked,\nand the opportunity to eat the occasional\npurple carrot. Serious action only came\nwhen self-propagating super-plants\nwere found growing by a road in Norfolk.\n\u201cBusinessmen don\u2019t understand that\nbiology is a lot messier than digital\ncopying,\u201d \u2018Percy\u2019 had said as we talked\nin her potting shed. \u201cThere\u2019s a dozen\nperfectly natural ways the terminator\ngene might have failed. One cosmic ray\ntaking out the right base pair would be\nenough!\u201d\nBut scientific sense was never going\nto stand up to irate politicians shouting\n\u201cSomething must be done!\u201d\nFines became prison sentences, the\nSeed Squads were established and we\nwere forced underground. Home gardens were no longer safe, so we became\nguerrilla gardeners \u2014 a secret society\nsharing seeds and planting contraband\ncrops in public spaces.\nWe tended them at night or just scattered seeds far and wide to let nature\ntake its course. That\u2019s when the network\nstarted and we adopted our noms de\nvert.\nWe were too successful. Nature was\nindeed the great copier. Our wilder\nstrains could fend for themselves and\nstarted to spread.\nThe gloves finally came off when the\ndirector of Smaxo\u2019s agricultural division found a clump of illegal Afghan\nPurple carrots growing at the bottom of\nhis garden and carpeted the Prime Minister. Of course, \u2018Monty\u2019 and his catapult didn\u2019t help.\nNow the only guerrilla gardener left\nis me.\nI collected my escape stash from Left\nLuggage along with Monty\u2019s seed cata-pult. The wig, hat and glasses helped\nme slip past the tighter police patrols\nand onto the sleeper to Fort William.\nLocked in my cabin I shaved my distinctive beard and used clippers so that\nI\u2019d match the fake ID in my stash.\nThe train would go through a lot of\nisolated country. The clean up crews\ncouldn\u2019t cover all that ground in one\nseason, so some of my seeds were going\nout of the window.\nAs for the rest\u2026\nThere are islands off the Scottish coast\ncontaminated by bioweapons testing\nfrom the Second World War. People are\nforbidden and there are no sheep or rab-bits. But their climate is ideal. The seed\ncatapult has enough range to reach them\nfrom a boat offshore.\nOr I could land and make certain\nthey\u2019re properly planted. The seeds will\ndo well on the islands, even if I don\u2019t.\nIn a few years they\u2019ll become a reserve\nfor natural, noncommercial diversity\nno matter what happens to me, the last\nguerrilla gardener.\nOF\nDavid L.

    "content": "Imperial alumnus and parliamentary science advisor Chandy Nath talks about her other life life as lead singer and\nsongwriter with steampunk/fusion band Sunday Driver, and\ntraces her influences back to Phoenix magazine\u2019s founder\nHG Wells.\nPhoenix: What\u2019s it like being a scientist and a musician,\nis it difficult to switch between the two?\nSunday Driver: That bit\u2019s not actually that difficult, it\u2019s really easy to just switch, I think because I\u2019ve been doing both\nfor so long. But the difficult bit is finding the creative space,\nso when everything gets busy at once it\u2019s really difficult to\ndecide whether to think about music or think about science\nand sometimes they push each other out.\nP: And is it difficult to find the time to devote to music?\nSD: It has been in the past. When I was a research scientist\nit was really difficult, because you can\u2019t choose your timings\nwith research. I guess the job I\u2019ve ended up in... it lends itself\nmuch more to allowing the space. Parliamentary recess is\nexactly when the festival season starts. But it can be a bit of\na nightmare, it\u2019s very hard to explain to people that you\u2019re\ngoing to miss a meeting because you\u2019ve got a gig.\nP: Do you think your science inspires your music?\nSD: Yes, totally. A lot of my early songs were actually inspired by things I did because of science. I\u2019m not actually\nsure if I\u2019d ever have started doing music if I didn\u2019t do sci-ence, it\u2019s symbiotic. My first postdoc was as a glaciologist\nand I spent four or five months in the Antarctic: that was\nwhen I really started writing my own songs, really decided I\nwanted to form a band. I kind of took a vow to myself... it\u2019s\nquite funny, I loved being in the Antarctic but the work itself\nwas so dull, it was so monotonous, and I just swore to myself that when I got back I\u2019d surround myself with noise and\ncolour and people and sounds, because you hear the same\nsounds over and over again, the pop of explosives in the ice\nand the chugging of the snowmobile and the sound of the\nshovel on snow... a hundred days with three blokes, even as\na female physicist I wasn\u2019t prepared for that. I didn\u2019t hear a\nfemale voice for three months, I think that might be partly\nwhy I started singing to myself!\nP: And do you think it works the other way round?\nSD: It\u2019s a more subtle thing, it\u2019s more that the creativity and\nthe performance gives me a lot more conviction, more confidence in what I\u2019m saying. I think that if I\u2019ve stood up on a\nstage and I\u2019ve gigged to a thousand people, I can definitely\nwrite a report about nuclear security. So, yeah, it\u2019s a confidence thing really. And I think the science helps with the\nmusic, partly because I\u2019m so desperate to get away from it!\nBy the time I get to band practice, it\u2019s such a massive relief.\nSometimes I leave work really stressed, and then after half an\nhour of singing practice I feel in a completely different place.\nSo yes, it helps me focus on everything else.\nP: When you were at Imperial, were you in any of the\nmusical or creative societies?\nSD: Well no, it\u2019s funny but actually I wasn\u2019t involved in anything musical at the time. I did creative things, but not as part\nof clubs. I tried to write poetry, drew pictures... one of the\nthings I did get into at Imperial was playing the piano. There\nwas a gorgeous grand piano in the Mechanical Engineering\nbuilding that anyone could go along and play, I used to drag\nfriends along and make them sit in an empty lecture theatre\nand play to me for an evening, it was magical. I\u2019d love to\nknow if it\u2019s still there, because I loved that piano\nP: Did you know about Phoenix?\nSD: I have to admit I didn\u2019t at the time. But I\u2019d have loved\nto know about it, because HG Wells is linked to the whole\nsteampunk thing which is a big inspiration for the band. And\none of the not-so-good things about Imperial was the absence\nof any kind of arts or humanities, I really missed that. When\nI was at Oxford I hung out with people who were doing hu-manities, it\u2019s really good to interact with people with different mindsets, it opens your mind up a little bit.\nP: If you had the opportunity, would you give up your\nday job to be a musician full-time?\nSD: No, if I had the opportunity, I would do science, but\nI\u2019d do it on my terms. In some ways it would be nice to try\nescaping from the routine. But in other ways I think it\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s allowed me to do what I\u2019ve done: Sunday Driver is\ncompletely creative, we\u2019re not governed by any need to appeal to a market, we just write the songs and make the music\nthat comes to us. We\u2019ve all had opportunities at one time or\nanother to make that transition, and we\u2019ve chosen not to. It\nused to tear me up a lot more, but now I\u2019m really happy with\nthe balance I\u2019ve got.That\u2019s one of the reasons I left research.\nI don\u2019t think I could have done research and been a singer,\nwhich is a shame, but it doesn\u2019t allow you to have another\npassion.\nP: When Sunday Driver started out, did you intentionally set out to create such a diverse band, in terms of the\ndifferent cultural and musical backgrounds you all have?\nSD: Well, I always wanted to do that. I don\u2019t really think the\nother people in the band were that bothered, they just wanted\nto make beautiful music, and because of the sorts of people we were, and our backgrounds, it ended up being really\ndiverse. And that was always what I wanted, so I probably\nsteered it in that direction, by bringing random tabla players\nalong to band practices and forcing band members to play\ninstruments they\u2019d never heard of.\nP: What about the steampunk influence?\nSD: We never set out to be a steampunk band, but the steampunk scene has adopted us to some extent over the past few\nyears, because the last couple of albums we\u2019ve done have\nvery much drawn on the interface between the Victorians\nand the British Raj, And steampunk\u2019s very scientific. That\u2019s\nsomething that really appeals to me, because I think a lot of\nthe wonder and the passion the Victorians had about science\nwas one of the best things about that time, just the amount\nof excitement that science inspired, things like the Royal Institution and the Great Exhibition in the 1850s, and I like to\ntake myself back to that era to be excited about science again\nsometimes.\nP: What advice would you give Imperial students with an\ninterest in music or art?\nSD: Totally go for it. I\u2019d say anything is possible, and I really\nthink you don\u2019t have to choose between music and science,\nDon\u2019t push yourself into categories because you think that\u2019s\nwhat you are or that\u2019s what people want. Try everything. If\nyou\u2019re into world fusion, make sure you listen to heavy rock.\nIf you\u2019re into heavy rock, make sure you go to the ballet. It\u2019s\nabout throwing different forms of art \u2014 different sounds \u2014\nat yourself from all angles. And have fun with it really!\nEAST\nMEETS\nWEST SUNDAY DRIVER\nFOLLOWING IN HG WELLS\u2019\nSTEAMPUNK FOOTSTEPS\nMy first postdoc was in\nthe Antarctic. I didn\u2019t\nhear a female voice for\nthree months, I think\nthat might be why I\nstarted singing...\n\u201d\n\u201c\nSteampunk\u2019s very\nscientific...the wonder\nand passion the\nVictorians had about\nscience was one of the\nbest things about that\ntime\n\u201c PHOENIX\n8\n\n"

During these hours even the\nemergency services do not respond,\nand it turns into a free-for-all Battle\nRoyale/Hunger Games in which the\npopulation is given the chance to get\nall violence and hatred out of their\nsystem.\nhe year is 2022, and \u201che Purge\u201d\nhas truly turned things around, with\nthe United States becoming a nation\nreborn thanks to this little cleansing\nprocess. James (Hawke) and Mary\n(Headey) don\u2019t take part in this ritual (as is their right), and traditionally hide out in their proudly forti\ufb01ed\nmansion, choosing not to get inThe Purge\nDirector: James DeMonaco\nScreenwriter: James DeMonaco\nStarring: Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey,\nMax Burkholder, Adelaide Kane\nvolved, but fully supporting the idea\nof \u201che Purge\u201d. heir children Zoey\n(Kane) and Charlie (Burkholder) are a\nlittle too young, na\u00efve and idealistic\nto fully comprehend the need for this\nyearly event (and to be quite frank,\nthe audience won\u2019t be fully sold on\nthis idea either) but it\u2019s the world they\nlive in now, and they need to learn to\ndeal with it.\nSo \u201che Purge\u201d starts bang on time\nat 7pm with a loud horn signalling\nthe beginning of all things criminal,\nand ends at 7am sharp, giving the\npublic plenty of time to unleash the\nmonsters within. hings seem to be\ngoing well for James\u2019 family, with the\npatriarch feeling con\ufb01dent that their\nstate-of-the-art brand new security\nsystems will keep out anyone who\nroams through the streets looking for\ntrouble.\nBut having dumb, useless children\nis certainly this family\u2019s massive\ndownfall. When their youngest Charlie sees a Bloody Stranger (Edwin\nHodge \u2013 this is his credited character\nname) crying out for help, the kindhearted idiot lets the man in. Turns\nout he\u2019s been running away from an\ninsane gang of masked youths who\nare exercising their Constitutional\nright to purge. his gang means busi-ness, all of them wielding deadly\nweapons, dressed to kill, aching for\nsome blood to be spilled. James\u2019 family has been thrown into this tur-moil, and as these youngsters start\na siege and an eventual home inva-sion, since their defence system really isn\u2019t all that great, they are left to\n\ufb01ght and fend for themselves; as until\n7am, there will be no help coming\ntheir way. Adding to this is another\ntroublesome o\ufb00spring of theirs: the\ndaughter \u2013 and her boyfriend who\nsnuck his way into the house for some\nmischievous action of his own.\nDespite the initially intriguing\npremise of this annual ritual, the \ufb01lm\ndoesn\u2019t actually spend too much time\non having a closer look at the event\nitself. As is the case with all standard home invasion movies, the lights\ngo o\ufb00, there are many sharp corners,\nthe bad guys are coming in from all\ndirections, and the good guys are\nat a tremendous disadvantage. he\nbuild-up isn\u2019t so well handled, with\nvery little and largely generic character development for the family dy-namic. Headey is much less interesting here without her Queen Regent\nCersei Lannister\u2019s sharp dialogue or\ncostumes, and Hawke is as smoothly\nconvincing as he always is, although\nhe isn\u2019t allowed to give much range to\nhis performance.\nHowever when the blood-thirsty,\npsychotic gang does break in, it\u2019s all\ntremendously fun. It\u2019s intriguing to\nsee what the ordinary citizens are\ncapable of \u2013 when the beast is unleashed \u2013 to protect their families\nand this is what the \ufb01lm tries to ex-plore. Hawke is fantastic when he\nbrings out the demons, which is really\nwhat the \ufb01lm tries to explore \u2013 just to\nwhat lengths can a family man go to\nwithout betraying what he stands for?\nBoth James and Mary are clear in the\nstart that they\u2019re not a violent part of\n\u201che Purge\u201d, and it\u2019s interesting to see\nhow dangerously close they get to the\nline they wish not to cross.\nAnd it\u2019s this theme the \ufb01lm should\nhave focused on more. But opting\nout of portraying depth and instead\nchoosing to go down the easy route\nof simple violence and loud crashes\nand thuds, what it eventually boils\ndown to is something familiar. It ends\non an outrageous and somewhat hysterically bizarre twist, one that further con\ufb01rms the \ufb01lm has very little\ncharacter consistency whatsoever.\nThe latest botox\ntreatments aren\u2019t\nwhat they used to be\nClowns used\nto be funny\nRemember everyone, make\nsure not to get any blood\non my brand new white tee\n\n"

Since it was a bank\nholiday weekend, it took us quite\na while to get to Wales. But by the\ntime we arrived, it stopped raining\nand although some were still sceptical about the weather, we trusted in\nthe weather forecast for the weekend\nthat it would be sunny and set up our\ntents.\nSaturday we drove to St David\u2019s\n(Britain\u2019s smallest city) and started\nour tour along the cli\ufb00s to the \ufb01shing\nvillage of Solva and Newgale Sands\nbeach. We had a relaxed walk with\na few stops to admire the beautiful\ncli\ufb00s and the landscape. For lunch we\nenjoyed \ufb01sh and chips and ice-cream,\nthe favourite food over the weekend.\nhe weather did not disappoint us,\nthe Sun was shining and at the end\nalmost everybody got sunburnt and\nthe \ufb01rst thing we did after \ufb01nishing\nour tour, was going to the supermarket to buy sun cream. We also bought\nfood for the next days and had a great\nbarbecue that evening at our campsite (Trefalen Farm, by Broad Haven\nbeach).\nWe were woken up by the sunshine on Sunday morning. It was so\nhot in the tent that no one wanted to\nbe inside anymore. After breakfast\nwe started a beach sightseeing tour\nfrom Manorbier castle, along the\ncoast. We were walking from beach\nto beach, sunbathing and the toughest going swimming in each one.\nWhile playing Frisbee and throwing\nthe Nerf around, nobody cared about\nthe freezing cold water. At the last\nbeach we split up. Some relaxed at\nthe beach; others went back to the\ncamp site and the rest took a walk\nnear a lily pond. here were so many\nlilies but it was too early for them\nto bloom, so we only saw the leaves.\nIn the evening we rejoined to have\nanother barbecue and to watch the\nmoon rise as night drew in.\nMonday morning we woke up to\ntotally di\ufb00erent weather. he wind\nwas blowing so strong, that we feared\nwe would be blown away with the\nwhole tent! Hence the \ufb01rst challenge\nof the day was getting the tent down\nand not being blown away. And to\nmake it even worse, it was starting to\nrain as well\u2026 but we completed our\nchallenge.\nAfter a little discussion, about\nwhat we could do for a walk, we decided to make a short walk, about an\nhour, along the cli\ufb00s from the Green\nBridge of Wales (a large rock archway\nextending out into the stormy sea) to\nSt Govan\u2019s chapel. his was enough\nto make everyone soaking wet! We\nhad our lunch in the chapel which is\nbuilt into the side of the cli\ufb00s. After\nchanging into dry clothes, we went\nto the minibus and set o\ufb00 to \ufb01nd a\nco\ufb00ee shop to warm us up. his was\nthe second challenge of the day. After looking for a caf\u00e9 in a castle and\n\ufb01nding out that there wasn\u2019t one, we\ndrove by a nice modern co\ufb00ee shop,\nstopped and had some nice teas,\nscones and hot chocolate. And then\nit was time to get back to London\u2026.\nSUN, SEA, SAND:\nFELLWANDERERS HIKE\nPEMBROKESHIRE\nSports writer\nJessi Wunder\nMust be up north; blue skies, beach and\nstill they have coats on!\nAll pictures courtesy of Terrence Lai.\nLook a horse!\nI don\u2019t see any wandering in this\npicture, in fells or otherwise.\n\n"

Although\nopen source, Android is developed in-house with little known to the outside\nworld save through the usual rumours\nand leaks. It\u2019s been no di\ufb00erent this\nyear. Prior to Google I/O, there has\nbeen signs of a new version of Android,\nversion 4.3 and widely believed to be a\nnew iteration of Jelly Bean showing up\nin server logs. he talk of the grapevine\nwas that this version would be unveiled\nduring the I/O event.\nIt wasn\u2019t.\nhere was no mention of it in the key-note, although there were cryptic references to it by engineers making pres-entations. However, given what was\nmentioned in the keynote itself, we\nmay glean some information towards\nGoogle\u2019s intentions.\nGoogle unveiled a\nnumber of new services\nit o\ufb00ers for Android\nduring the event. First\nof all, it unveiled the\nGoogle Play Music All\nAccess service, which is\na Spotify-esque service\nthat allows unlimited\nstreaming of any music\nin Google Play\u2019s library for\na \ufb01xed monthly fee. his is built\non top of the already excellent Music service which allows you to upload\n20 000 songs to the cloud for streaming anywhere.

The participants of the experiment had to navigate a helicopter through an obstacle course only using\ntheir thoughts. This success, among others, will aid in the goal to allow those\nthat are paralysed to use machines that one day may help them to walk.\nProject Haswell\nIntel has now released a new generation of processors named Haswell. These,\naccording to the firm, are capable of a 15% better performance as well as 50%\nmore active-use battery life than its predecessors. This is achieved by placing a voltage regulator directly into the chip. Also it will allow tablet/laptop\ncombinations to be much thinner,as it will not need as much cooling as the\nIvy Bridge version. Intel will hope that the Haswell processors will allow it to\nbreak into the mobile market, where ARM has been dominating so far.\nCharger attack\nYou can now hack an iPhone with a charger... great! This feat, achieved by\na team from the Georgia Institute of Technology, means that iOS is more\nvulnerable than previously thought. Using a widely available BeagleBoard\nComputer, costing roughly \u00a330, the charger easily installed a virus into the\ngadget. While at this moment this method of stealing your data is not really\na problem, if Apple do not patch this up, you should beware how you charge\nyour phone!\nAndroid, Windows 8, Morph!!\nAt this years Computex convention in Taipei, Taiwan, Acer has now unveiled\na laptop that runs both Android Jelly Bean as well as Windows 8. This is probably a move to tap into the phablet/laptop-tablet market, and thus boost the\nailing tech company\u2019s fortunes. I however don\u2019t really see the appeal in this.\nI mean what is Jelly Bean going to do on your laptop that it can\u2019t do on your\nmobile phone? Unless Acer has somehow modified Android, not much.\nWindows 8 Start Button, OMGG!\nYAY! Also released at Computex the new update to Windows 8, 8.1 and formerly known as Windows Blue, will once again reintroduce the iconic start\nbutton, whose omission was a big talking point when Windows 8 first came\nout. Now Microsoft has bowed to popular demand, and what we all loved is\nback. This move as well others seem to indicate the Redmond giant\u2019s focus on\nthe \u201cdesktop\u201d environment, emphasising that it is similar to Windows 7, in a\nbid to encourage more people to upgrade to the new OS.\nOn A Personal Note\nOnce again some personal news. Recently, after being disillusioned by my lack\nof purpose in life post-examination, I decided to Google myself, just for shits\nand giggles. Funnily enough I came upon a BlackBerry forum, that seemed\nto really erm enjoy my BlackBerry article (\u201cCrackBerry or CrapBerry\u201d). Once\nthe forum members had dissected title and scoffing at the bad attempt at hu-mour, skipping over actually reading the article, they then decided to have a\ngo at Felix as a whole. Eek. However some of these users seemed to somehow\nseemed to miss that Felix was a student newspaper, instead assuming that it\nwas some lonely individual who had a strange obsession with Imperial College London. If you wanna have a look at extreme FanBoism as well as tell tale\nsymptons to avoid just head over to that forum!\nhttp://forums.crackberry.com/news-rumors-f40/yet-another-new-article-crackberry-crapberry-769412/\nGoogle Play\nMusic All Access; service\nthat allows\nunlimited\nstreaming Tech editor\nalso in the works.\nhere is a common theme to the\nnew features: they run on existing\n(well, newer ones at least) versions\nof Android without needing an up-date. Android updates has always\nbeen a sticking point in the Android\necosystem, causing Fragmentation\n(TM) and other nasties. By not announcing a new version of Android\nwhile revealing a slew of new Android features, it is likely that Google\nwas attempting to show that they can\nadd new features to Android without updating the underlying version\nof Android itself. We \ufb01rst saw these\ne\ufb00orts when Google applications on\nAndroid such as Gmail began to be\n\u201d\n\u201c\nThere is a\ncommon\ntheme to the\nnew features:\nno update!\nupdated from the Google Play store\nwithout needing a new version of\nAndroid. Google I/O continues this\ne\ufb00ort by decoupling some of the\napplications from the Android core. It is likely that\nthis will continue in the\nnear future.\nAnother reason could\nbe due to the increasing consumerisation of\nthe Google I/O event.\nhe event was originally\nenvisioned to be a platform for Google to reach\nout to developers. he increasing prominence of Android in\nrecent years have caused consumer\nattention to increase for the event,\nthreatening to derail it from its developer roots. his could be an attempt to shift the event back to its\noriginal focus, and perhaps create\nanother event just for consumers. If\nthat is the case, then we may yet see\nanother event to announce a new\nversion of Android down the road.\nhe current rumours, which should\nbe taken with a pinch of salt, points\nto early June for this.\nOf course, all of the above is simply speculation \u2013 Google may have\nintended to show Android 4.3 at\nthe I/O event but it simply failed to\nmaterialise due to some last minute\nproblems. We may never know. It is,\nhowever, nice to see that Google can\nin fact update Android without updating Android.\nYong Wen Chua\n\n"

For example, under the current system two students\nmight earn \ufb01nal percentages of 59.0%\nand 60.1% and yet be awarded the very\ndi\ufb00erent classi\ufb01cations of 2:2 and 2:1\nrespectively. A grade point average\nwould also encourage students in the\n\ufb01nal year to work hard regardless of\nwhether their marks so far are within\nwhat would have previously been a\nboundary for a particular classi\ufb01cation.\nPotential concerns, however, have\nalso been identi\ufb01ed. he GPA might\nlead to a greater focus on grades as opposed to learning the subject \u2013 possibly leading to grade inflation and students choosing easier modules to get\nhigher grades. his is the main reason\nwhy the London School of Economics\nopposes the changes. he lack of information given by the current broad\ncategories is also already alleviated by\nemployers being able to ask graduates for their academic transcripts or\na breakdown of their module marks.\nIt might therefore not be worth the\nadministrative cost of introducing a\ncompletely new system.\nhe group of universities supporting the changes said, in a statement\nreleased in September 2012, that they\nwere merely \u201cseeking a measure that\ncan be a motivational tool for students\nduring their university study and give\nemployers and others the information\nthey need following graduation\u201d. hey\nadded that they believed that \u201cthere\nare aspects to academic practice in\nthe UK, including marking culture,\nsecond marking, marking criteria,\nand external examination, which can\nindeed help to counteract some of the\nconcerns about the US experience of\nGPA\u201d.\nWhile employers groups, such as\nthe Association of Graduate Recruiters, have expressed cautious support\nof the changes reactions from Imperial students and academics have been\nmore ambivalent. Jonathan London,\nPhysics Departmental Representative, told Felix that he believed that\n\u201cwe have a system which works, so\nwe should focus our time and money\non pressing issues\u201d. An Imperial College academic, who wishes to remain\nanonymous, said: \u201chis seems to be\nchange for change\u2019s sake with little\nbene\ufb01t to anyone. It will give a false\nimpression of precision beyond the\n4 classes of degree we have now, and\nthat doesn\u2019t help graduates or em-ployers. And after all is done many\nemployers will still reasonable understand that a 2:1 from Imperial is\nat least as good as a \ufb01rst in the same\nsubject from non-name-city newuniversity.\u201d Another student, who did\nnot wish to be named, seemed to think\nit was not really much di\ufb00erent: \u201cIt\u2019s\njust a di\ufb00erent way of showing your\nperformance, it won\u2019t make you a better or worse student. Besides, we can\nlook at our overall weighted percentage through the registry, which is way\nmore divided than with a GPA.\u201d\nhe issue was discussed at the last\nmeeting of the Union Council and\nwill be considered further at the next\nmeeting.

A couple of\nmonths ago a new website was started\nthat provides yet more evidence for\nfeminism\u2019s role in society. \u2018100% Men\u2019\naims to reveal \u2018corners of the world\nwhere women have yet to tread\u2019\n, exposing places where female representation\nis sorely lacking. However, while it may\nnot seem surprising that there has never been a female president of the Royal\nSociety, or that male MPs outnumber\nfemale ones 4:1, under representation\nof women extends far into some surprising facets of life.\nhe artistic world, which is often held\nup as an egalitarian beacon of hope,\nis also guilty of preferring men over\nwomen, especially within the visual\narts. he Tate Modern may have just\nopened a retrospective of the Lebanese\nabstract artist Saloua Raouda Choucair,\nbut in the Tate Britain\u2019s lauded new re-hang, which they describe as \u2018a circuit\nof Tate Britain\u2019s unparalleled collection,\nfrom beginning to end\u2019\n, less than 8% of\nthe works are by female artists. Women\nmake up over 60% of art students, but\nonly contribute to 30% of the works\ndisplayed in London\u2019s galleries. So, with\nsuch a disparity, it is surely fair to ask:\n\u201cwhere are the women?\u201d\nhis is a question that is familiar\nto the Guerrilla Girls, a collective of\nfeminist activists who combat sexism\nin the art world through humour and\nhard-hitting visuals. Founded in 1985,\nfollowing the MoMA\u2019s exhibition An\nInternational Survey of Recent Painting\nand Culture, in which only 13 of the 169\nartists were women, they have become\nknown for their distinctive visual style.\nTaking on the names of dead female\nartists and dressing up in gorilla masks,\nthey descend upon art galleries, leaving\na trail of evidence of discrimination in\ntheir wake. One of their most famous\nposters is from 1989, and asks the question \u2018do women have to be naked to get\ninto the Met?\u2019\n, prompted by the fact that\nless than 5% of the artists in the Met\u2019s\nmodern section were women, but 85%\nof the nudes were. In a recent recount\nthey found that \u2013 despite more than 20\nyears of activism, during which museum curators promised to display more\nart by women and minority artists \u2013 the\npercentage of female artists had actually decreased. But why is this the case?\nWhy are the major museums so reluctant to display works by women artists?\nCould the disparity be down to the\n\u2018Male Gaze\u2019? First described by feminist \ufb01lm theorist Laura Mulvey in 1975,\nit describes the idea that in \ufb01lm \u2013 and\nindeed, within any visual art form \u2013 we\nare looking from the perspective of a\nheterosexual male. hey are in control\nof the camera, the ones holding the\nbrush, and therefore it is through their\neyes that we see the work.\nhe case has been made that the female form is more visually appealing\nand, although it could be argued that\nthis is only due to how entrenched the\ngaze is in society, perhaps this is why\nthere are so few female artists; lacking\n\u2018the gaze\u2019\n, they \ufb01nd it more di\ufb03cult to\nmake work that is appealing to viewers.\nhis could also explain the disproportionate number of female nudes \u2013 they\nare simply more appealing. Just as the\ncamera lingers on a woman\u2019s curves, so\ntoo does the artistic canon linger on the\nnudes of Titian, Manet, and Klimt.\nSuch an explanation is simple and\nconcise;unfortunatelyitisalsomisguid-ed. here is no shortage of female artists\nexploring their own form, and yet it is\nrare that we get to see these portrayals.\nIt can be seen in the work of Nan Goldin, whose pu\ufb00y bruised face stares out\nof photos, acting as a documentation of\nher abuse. It can be seen in the work of\nTracey Emin, whose exploration of her\nrape and sexuality is bold and brave.\nAnd it can be seen in the work of Hannah Wilke, whose brutal posthumous\ncollection Intra-Venus documents her\nslow death from lymphoma. his work\nis seldom seen in galleries, and is even\nrarer in art history classes.\nhe women in these works are too\nreal, too exposed for the general pub-lic. hey have not been sanitised, their\ncurves are not immortalised in soft col-ours. his view is captured by Martha\nRosler in her 1977 video performance\nVital Statistics of a Citizen, Simply Obtained, in which Rosler gradually strips,\nand her measurements are taken by a\nteam of male scientists. It is a representation of an art world in which women\nexist only as objects, as a series of meas-urements, rather than living, breathing\npeople.\nhese women have taken control of\ntheir own bodies, refusing to simply\nbe objects on canvas, and yet they are\nall too often attacked for being \u2018self absorbed\u2019\n, their work seen as little more\nthan a vanity project. It is a similar\nview that many people have towards\nperformance art, a medium that has a\nlong history of brilliant female artists.\nFrom Yoko Ono and Laurie Anderson, to Carolee Schneemann and Marina Abramovi\u0107, there is no shortage of\nwomen creating witty, self-aware art-works; and yet, for many, performance\nart is seen as \u2018non-art\u2019\n.\nSuch an attitude has also been taken\nagainst the art forms historically dominated by women.

But people\nlike Al Reynolds, Charlie Stross, Paul\nMcAwley, Stephen Baxter, they are\nmore in the department of what I\u2019m trying to do. But they\u2019ve spent a lot more\ntime building up their writing careers,\nand I\u2019ve spent my time building up an\nacademic career.\nP: Do you have any plans to write a\nnovel for publication?\nDC: I am writing one at the moment,\ngoing through the revisions at this\nstage. We\u2019ll see how that goes!\nP: Why did you choose to write science fiction rather than another genre or more mainstream fiction?\nDC: I\u2019ve been in the science fiction\nworld for a long time. When I was a\nstudent here I ran the science fiction\nsociety, and from that I got involved\nin what\u2019s known as the science fiction\nfandom. I\u2019ve run conventions, and it\u2019s\nalso what I read. But that doesn\u2019t mean\nI haven\u2019t got the ideas for some more\nmainstream stories, novels, floating\naround in my mind.\nP: What do you think about the\n\u201clablit\u201d genre? Do you think that\u2019s\ngoing to become a big thing?\nDC: I\u2019ve published a few things on the\nLablit.com site. I know Jenny Rohn,\nwho runs it, and I like what she\u2019s doing,\nbut I feel she draws the line between\nscience fiction and \u201clablit\u201d a little bit\ntoo rigidly, and there\u2019s a lot more com-monality between the two. The prob-lem, at least in the UK, with science\nfiction is the old \u201ctwo cultures\u201d, where\nfrankly literature-based literary critics\nare scared of science. They can\u2019t tell\nwhat\u2019s made up and what\u2019s not. They\ndon\u2019t like science very much, so they\ndon\u2019t have a basis to understand it, and\nso they denigrate the whole thing.\nP: Do you think modern science fiction is becoming more literary, especially in the short fiction world, with\nplaces like Clarkesworld publishing\nwork quite literary in style?\nDC: There\u2019s always a space for that.\nMaybe the fact that I\u2019ve never managed\nto get anything into Clarkesworld demonstrates that perhaps they are more lit-erary! There\u2019s always been a spectrum,\nwith people like Jeff Ryman, who were\nmuch more literary than people like Arthur C. Clarke, even though they were\nwriting at the same time. It\u2019s not a hard\nsolidly delineated \u201cyou\u2019re one thing or\nthe other\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s a shading.\nP: What would you say was your\nproudest achievement as a writer?\nDC: If I was wearing my science fiction\nfan hat, it would be the Analog story\n[A War of Stars, published in Analog\nmagazine]. But bearing in mind that I\u2019m\nsitting in my office here at Imperial, it\nwould be the Nature story [Last of the\nGuerrilla Gardeners, published in Nature]. I came this close to having my\nNature Futures story in the same issue\nthat I had a paper that I co-authored. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t manage to swing\nit, but that would have been fun.\nP: Finally, what advice would you give\nto students or young scientists who\nwant to combine writing or other creative pursuits with a scientific career?\nDC: Keep doing it. Writing, whether\nit\u2019s a scientific paper, a piece of fiction,\na nonfiction article, or a lab report, the\nmore you practice communicating in the\nwritten form, the better you will get at it.\nI imagine that\u2019s also true for visual arts,\nfor acting, for, well, for doing science! If\nyou want to do something, you get better at it by doing it. Not by reading about\ndoing it, not by watching movies about\npeople who are doing it, but by doing it.\nSo keep on keeping on.\n23\nPHOENIX\n\n"

BSc (Hons) Ost\n\u201cYou asked me once, what was in\nRoom 101. I told you that you knew\nthe answer already. Everyone knows\nit. he thing that is in Room 101 is the\nworst thing in the world.\u201d\nRoom 101: a setting from Orwell\u2019s\nNineteen Eighty-Four, the room where\neveryone\u2019s worst fear is contained. For\nthe protagonist Winston Smith it was\nrats. For others it might be as sensible\nas snakes, or as bizarre as flowers. Say\nwhat you will, but everyone has some\nsort of fear.\nOr do they? In the United States\na woman, known only as S.M., has\nUrbach-Wiethe (UW) disease, an incredibly rare genetic disorder with\nonly 300 or so cases recorded in medical literature. One of the symptoms in\nUW disease is the destruction of the\namygdalae, almond-shaped groups of\nnuclei embedded within the brain.\nhe main impact of this destruction\nis the complete absence of fear within\npatient S.M. A group of scientists attempted to scare her with, amongst\nother things, poisonous snakes and\narachnids, horror \ufb01lms and haunted\nhouses. Long story short they failed\nmiserably. hey couldn\u2019t perturb S.M.\nOnly recently have researches found\nsomething that does trigger a fear\nresponse in UW su\ufb00erers: high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the\nblood. he fear of su\ufb00ocation, simulated by breathing in high quantities of\ncarbon dioxide, prompted the patients\nto feel fear for the \ufb01rst time in their\nlives. his suggests that the amygda-lae, whilst important, are not exclusively the domain of the fear response.\nHowever unpleasant fear may be\nS.M.\u2019s case highlights the role it has to\nplay in human survival from an evolutionary psychological standpoint:\nS.M.\u2019s lack of fear has led her to handle dangerous animals that most sane\npeople would seek to avoid. Just as pain\nis a protective mechanism to stop us\nfrom inflicting further damage upon\nourselves fear probably had a role to\nplay in preventing early humans from\nrunning headlong into danger. Fears\nof snakes, spiders and other such creatures is likely a throwback from those\ntimes, and partly explains why people\nsuch as Europeans still display seemingly irrational fear responses towards\nharmless European animals.\nBut what if, using knowledge from\nS.M. and other UW su\ufb00erers, we could\n\u2018shut o\ufb00\u2019 fear? Create super soldiers\ncapable of fearlessly charging into\nbattle? Fire \ufb01ghters who run headlong into burning buildings? Despite\ndamage to her amygdala S.M. is otherwise normal. Already people display\na complete absence of fear in certain\nextraordinary situations (sometimes\ncalled aphobia). his pushes them to\notherwise impossible extremes. Selectively being able to dampen or even\neliminate fear in this manner could\nprove extraordinarily useful.\nSuch an on/o\ufb00 switch to fear would\nhave to be carefully controlled. As\nhandy as such a switch might be a\ncomplete lack of fear also means no\nlonger fearing death. Already serving soldiers, \ufb01re \ufb01ghters, and those in\nother high-risk occupations put their\nlives on the line. Hypothetical users\nof a fear switch would have to accept\nthat their lives would be placed at even\nhigher risk.\nBut controlling fear is still some\nway o\ufb00. As the case of S.M. shows the\namygdala plays a large role in controlling fear, but its function would\nneed to be clearly understood before\nit could be e\ufb03ciently turned on and\no\ufb00 \u2018as needed\u2019. In the meantime you\u2019ll\njust have to man up and ignore that innocent garden spider in the corner of\nyour room. he little guy isn\u2019t going to\nhurt you.\nScience Editor\nFlicking off the fear switch\nLaurence Pope\nSteve Irwin didn\u2019t have Urbach-Wiethe\ndisease. Dude just had balls of steel\n\n"
