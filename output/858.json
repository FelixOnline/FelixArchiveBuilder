    "content": "Naughty Mushrooms Help!\nConfusion and mutual mud slinging reigned at a recent\nKingston Polytechnic Union General Meeting. Ms\nCeri Hill, president of Kingston Polytechnic Student\nUnion (KPSU), was the subject of a motion of no-confidence over allegations of misdirection of union\nfunds.\nThe four sabbaticals of KPSU have access to a hospitality fund of around \u00a31200 between them. The\nfund was abolished at the beginning of this academic\nyear in favour of a pay increase which students of\nthe polytechnic believe to be \u00a31500 each. This\ndecision was taken during a meeting of the sabbaticals\nand the Honorary Treasurer, who is appointed jointly\nby the union president and Dr Robert Smith, Director\nof the polytechnic.\nThough Dr Smith was unavailable for comment,\nhis deputy said that he believed that 'the Senior\ntreasurer was satisfied with the situation and that the\nmatter was closed.'\nAs the vote of no-confidence took place at the union\ngeneral meeting a fire alarm was activated and both\nsides of the argument blamed the other for its\noccur en ce, claiming that the vote would have been\nmore on their side if it had not happened. The motion\nwas defeated by a small majority of three during a vote of nearly 500 people.\nUnlike those at IC, the KPSU sabbaticals do not\nget any funding to cover accommodation or expenses\nencountered during working for the union. Adding\nto the confusion at the meeting, Mr Jonathan Smith,\nVice President (Communications and Sites), claimed\nthat the financial decisions made by the Honorary\nTreasurer were confidential and that the sabbaticals\nwere bound by an agreement not to discuss them.\nExhibition\nAn exhibition of art produced by the students and staff\nof Imperial College and St. Mary's will be held for\na month from the 19th February. The works of art\nwill be displayed in the anteroom to the college\nrefectory on the ground floor of the Sherfield building.\nAll work must be given in to Ms Sarah Greenwood\nor Ms Caroline Brice by the first day of the exhibition.\nApplication forms are available from the above\n(extensions 6801 and 5251 respectively). Works are\non display to be sold, and the exhibition will levy a commission of 20%.\nMs Greenwood added that the exhibition was to\nshow 'as much work from as many people as\npossible'.\nCareers cost\nImperial College Union President, Mr Neil\nMcCluskey, has sent a personal letter to the Rector,\nSir Eric Ash, following the proposed Careers service\ncutbacks. The Rector believes that professional people\nare being used to perform mundane tasks in the\ncareers library. Mr McCluskey has compromised by\nsaying that, in his view, a maximum of half of the\njob could be given to students, whilst retaining the\npart of the role that requires a professional.\nMr McCluskey stated that the union was willing\nto fund this part of the post from the profits generated\nfrom the careers fair. It is estimated that it would cost\nthe Union \u00a35000 per annum.\nThe British Pugwash Group\u2014an international group\nof politically minded scientists\u2014are to screen the new\nRoland Joffe film 'Shadow Makers' concerning the\ndevelopment of the atom bomb, starring Paul\nNewman. The film will be shown on February 24th and will be followed by a discussion chaired by\nMichael Ignatieff and including other luminaries.\nFree tickets are available from: Shadow Makers,\nPugwash, Flat A,63 A Great Russel st, London\nWC1B 3BG or telephone 405 6661.\nInter-rail\nBritish Rail has announced that Inter-Rail plus boat\ntickets for 1990 will cost \u00a3180 and will allow one\nmonths unlimited travel in 22 countries. As from this\nyear Czechoslovakia and asiatic Turkey, are included\nin the price.\nA rail ticket alone will cost \u00a3155 and an Tnter-rail\nFlexicard' which allows 10 days unlimited travel\nwithin one month will cost \u00a3145. Roll up and see a crumbling bit of the Soviet empire of your choice\nUniversities in Czechoslovakia are appealing to\nwestern Universities for help in rebuilding their\neducation system. They particularly ask for\ninformation on the structures of student unions and\nlists of teachers who would be willing to lecture in\nEnglish, German or Russian. They are also asking\nfor textbooks, especially in mathematics, physics,\nelectrical engineering and languages. The country has\na deficit of photocopiers, and requests these too.\nAnybody willing to help in these or in financial\nways should contact Dr A.D. Caplin of Electrical\nEngineering (extension 6904).\nHumanities\nA lecture entitled 'How we French produce our\nengineers' will be given by M. Jean Chinal, the\nCounsellor for Science and Technology at the French\nEmbassy on Tuesday 13 February.\nThe talk will take place in the Read Theatre at 1:15\npm.\nDamned lies0 h dear! Mr John McGregor, Secretary of State for Education,\nhas justified the use of an 'enabling act' allowing the\nGovernment to implement Student Loans by saying\nthat changes can be made to the scheme more quickly.\nHe said that minor alterations to the scheme, for\ninstance the defer ral of repayments, may be brought\nin after a few years.\nAn enabling act, in this case, allows a government\nminister to implement Student Loans. The act does\nnot contain any details so it cannot be amended to\nany extent in the House of Commons, relying entirely\non Conservative Party decisions.\nA critical article on the University of London has cited\na study into the relationship between Senate House,\nheadquarters of the University of London, and its\nconstituent colleges written by last year's Imperial\nCollege Secretary, Mr John Smith. The feature\nappeared in last week's issue of the Times Higher\nEducation Supplement\nThe Smith report claims that there are gross\nbureaucratic inefficiencies in the cumbersome and\nelaborate system and that the constituent colleges are\nnot consulted in most proposals.\nThe feature claims that the senate and its financial\nwing, the University Court, interfere in college\nmatters and are unduly secret in their affairs.\nCorridors of power\nA motion to unseat University of London Union\n(ULU) President, Chris Massey, may be defeated by\nprocedural wrangling s at the next meeting of its\nCouncil.\nThe motion of no-confidence, which was passed\nat aUL U Executive meeting on January 25th, has\nbeen amended in the papers for the General Union\nCouncil (GUC) by chairman Jim Coyle. Mr Coyle\nhas ruled accusations concerning permanent staff out\nof order. He now intends to rule the entire motion\nout of order at the meeting next Tuesday.\nThe motion, proposed by UL U Vice President\n(Finance and Administration), Paul Kilvington and\nseconded by Imperial's Hal Calamvokis, makes a number of accusations which Mr Massey denies. Mr\nMassey has been accused of abusing Union funds\nduring a trip to last year's National Union of Students\nWinter Conference and of having little regard for\nULU meetings.\nA large part of the argument against Mr Massey\nhas settled around his alleged attempts to discredit\nmembers of ULU's permanent staff As UL U President, Mr Massey is not the employer of UL U employees, who are payed by the University of\nLondon. He is not allowed to pass official comment\non Union staff\nMr Massey is concerned for ULU's autonomy from\nthe University and stood on a platform of attempting\nto free the Union. He told FELIX that he denied the\nallegations of discrediting staff and added that the\n'evidence' for the matter was subject to a libel action.\nHe added that he was not in a position to hold an\nopinion on staff since he is not the employer. 'Even\nif I'm sacked, this will one be bubbling for a long\ntime,' he said.\nWith dissent amongst the UL U executive Mr\nMassey has complained of papers disappearing from\nhis office and being shown to permanent staff. He\ntold FELIX that a major breach of ULU's constitution\nhad been made when a permanent member of staff\nblocked the mailing of the papers for Tuesday's meeting under the instructions of a 'member of GUC.'\n'The Union is in crisis,' since its autonomy has been\ninfringed in this way according to Mr Massey.\nTalking about his hopes to move UL U away from\na commercial arrangement to one with a main aim\nof serving students, Mr Massey said, T often feel the\nstudent takes a back place in UL U.'

    "content": "No news blues\nDear Dave,\n'The respective news pages are accurate but\nunexciting, the features well written but\nuncompromisingly uncontroversial and the columnists\nfar too well informed to say anything remotely silly.'\nThis quote last week in FELIX was attributed to the\nIndependent on Sunday. However, it equally well\ndescribes last week's edition of FELIX.\nNews coverage in FELIX now accounts for less than\n10% of the paper's content. (Last week 2 pages of\nnews out of a total of 22 pages.) Even my local free\nadvertising sheet manages to report more news, when\nthis is not its main objective. This begs the question\nof what is FELIX's main objective? Do you wish to be\na remote feature and artistic review magazine, or do\nyou wish to address issues that are relevant to\nstudents at IC? I can appreciate the need for some\nadvertising to generate revenue, but is all this other\nwaffle that bears no relationship to the student\nreadership really necessary?\nI look forward to this year's sabbatical elections,\nand the prospects for an improved FELIX next year.\nYours\nRachel Stone, Min Res Eng 2.\nIf there is one regret I have this year it is our\nreduced news coverage. The problem is a shortage of staff on the news section of FELIX.\nSince you seem so concerned, I suggest you do\nsomething more constructive than wait for the\nsabbatical elections and come in to FELIX to help\non the news team. A new editor will almost\ncertainly change the direction of FELIX but the\nshortage of news staff is not something that can\nbe solved just by putting a piece of paper in a ballot box.\nFor your information, I was news editor last\nyear. I do have a keen interest in news and would\nwelcome any help in this area. Our current news\neditor, Adam, is working as hard as he can. I am\nsure he will join me in looking forward to your\nassistance on the news pages of FELIX.\nEd.\nAfrican beat\nDear Dave,\nI'm writing to protest about the 'Chase the Base'\nevent on February 2 1990 in the Sherfield JCR. During\nthis event people were admitted without verification\nof Imperial College Students' Union membership. The\nresult was that a friend of mine was accosted by four\n'gentlemen' who demanded the sum of five pounds,\non pain of death. These so-called gentlemen\nthreatened to get their colleagues to stab him if he\ndidn't pay up. Following this, another friend of mine\nstood in to help his friend as they attempted to remove\nhis watch; he got a bloody nose for his efforts. Prior\nto this a friend of theirs had handed over a sum of\nmoney in response to a similar threat.\nAs we are all aware, Union cards must be presented\nat every social event on College grounds. This rule\nwas certainly not inforced on the evening in question.\nI can find no explanation for this and would also like\nto know the reason for the lack of security at this\nevent. A repetition of this is bound to happen at future\nevents unless security arrangements are improved.\nTo my knowledge no one has been 'stabbed' at a Union event before, and I would like to keep it that\nway.\nAH Mobasheri (Life Sci Dep Rep),\n(Writing on behalf of two students who would\nprefer to remain anonymous).\nMotion on\nmotion\nDear Dave,\nThe motion on increased travel subsidy for students\nrepresenting the College in competition is not an ACC\nmotion although it has been discussed at an ACC\nmeeting. The word 'discussed' should be emphasised\nas this is the second stage in the decision making\nprocess, the first stage is to establish the facts\npertaining to the subject under discussion (simple so\nfar, and not at all patronising). The facts are, as a College we are very poor in sports and recreational\nfacilities, embarrassingly poor, in fact, although you'd never know it from the prospect i and brochures. What\nis not an established fact, but we wish to demonstrate\nit as such, is that the cost of competing in our chosen\nsport is becoming prohibitive. This is due to increases\nin travel costs (as of 3.2.90), a decrease in students'\ndisposable income etc, we won't go on since we feel\nothers, notably Mr Wyatt, do it so much better than\nus.\nReturning to the informative angle of our letter\nwhere are our facilities. The field sports were based\nat Harlington until College dug a very large hole.\nWhere we used to have 'one of the finest areas of\ngrass in central London' (quote SHB 1989), we now\nhave a pleasant cabbage patch. Those who pursue\nindoor sports at IC are an essentially nomadic breed\nwho travel where and when they have to to find an\narea large enough to use. A fact is that the largest\nindoor facility in the College is an old gym in the Old\nChemistry Building which has been due for demolition\nfor a very long time. Two final facts; the students of\nthis College receive no money from the South\nKensington Sports Centre, since like Southside, it is\nowned and run by College, although not at a profit,\nunlike Southside. Secondly, nearly one in four\nmembers of. this College has joined an ACC Club,\nwhich makes them members of a minority, about the\nsame proportion as those who voted for the present\nGovernment at the last general election. So here's to\ndemocracy in action, if we manage to harness our\ncollective apathy, at least if we get to a debate, we\nmay be better informed-a whole new experience for\nmost Union meetings.\nYours,\nM Rayfield,\nJ F Lucas.\nTo all students and staff in\nCity & Guilds College.

    "content": "Burnt offering\nDear Mr Smedley,\nAs my name was, without provocation, mentioned\ntwice in last week's FELIX, I feel compelled to answer.\nFirst, the religious bit: we are in a scientific College,\na fortress of rationalism. That is why (whatever you\nmight think) we are more aware than others of our\nneed for religion, since other 'substitutes' (mere\nUtopias) have no appeal on us (or is the answer to life,\nthe Universe and everything still 42?).\nThe Scorceses (illegible\u2014TS), the Godless\n(illegible\u2014TS), the National Abortion Campaign, these\nrepresentatives of a new obscura nt is m, have spoken\nloudly, unashamedly, they have swamped Europe.\nThey worship anarchy, greed, lust, they destroy\npeoples' vision to proclaim themselves sole guide.\nYou took their side! Our Lord Jesus Christ will plead\nfor you, though: you've got plenty of time to change\nyour mind and save your soul. Who, in the meantime\nwill let us speak loudly? If you, an elected student\npaper editor, refuse to convey the views of the\nmajority of students in here, how can anyone accuse\npeople who have interests in promoting ignorance and\ngreed, for the sinking of our Western European\nsociety?\nNow for the 'Praise' but: I would like to thank Chris\nBrowne for promoting me thus.\nI wish to answer that, first of all I have given\nSpeakers' Corner a thought; but then I said: having\nthe privilege to speak to an enlightened audience like\nIC students is surely more worthwhile: was I wrong?\nI don't plan to stand as a sabbatical since, being a foreigner, I cannot afford it. There exists another\nreason though: on some issues I do not have the same\nopinions as the majority and my opinions are not 'for\nsale'.\nYours most faithfully,\nEmmanuel Saradakis, Physics 2.\nDear Mr Two slices short of a sandwich,\nI have burnt your letter, as a sacrifice to\nBeelzebub. Its amusing content is printed for the\nadoration of the masses.\nEd.\nWhy oh why? Nasty cult\nin Evelyn\nDear Editor,\nRE: 'No more please' 2.2.90\nI was saddened to read your comment on 'God\nSquad pro pog and a' as yo ir understandably see it, and\nI would agree with you that the pages of FELIX are\nnot the place for 'spreading the word'. Surprised?\nHowever, the many Christians in College feel\nstrongly about 'normal' College issues and obviously\nGod comes into their point of view. Perhaps it would\nbe beneficial to allow a Christian viewpoint on certain\nissues. 'This is a newspaper for everyone after all'.\nMaybe the 'cloud of despair' which hangs over\nCollege and '...nobody can ever identify what the\nproblem is. But it will not go away.' (See 'Imperial is\na con' 2.2.90) and the rejection of anything remotely\nChristian are not entirely unconnected?\nWell, I don't know if this letter constitutes stuffing\nreligion down peoples' throats. If it does, I 'll await my\ninvitation to the sacrificial burning. I prefer to see it\nas the concerned opinion of a fellow student.\nYours sincerely,\nDave Kirk, Aero 3 (President Christian Union).\nWhy oh why\noh why?\nDear FELIX,\nWe are very worried about the presence of CLCC\nin Imperial College. The Central London Church of\nChrist are a cult formed in Boston USA and are\ndistinguished by having had their leaders thrown off\nthe University campus there. They came to London\nsix years ago and now have over 5,000 members,\nmany of whom are students.\nThey attract individuals to their bible studies, often\nnot mentioning who they represent, at which there\nare generally two members to each non-member.\nThey are determined in keeping non-members going\nto the bible studies or church and have no qualms\nabout using high pressure tactics, such as persistently\nphoning.\nEach new members is tutored by two members of\nthe cult. They are persuaded to devote themselves\nand their money to 'church' work to the detriment of\nCollege work and any outside interests or friends. If\na member tries to leave the cult then they are\nthreatened by several means. One is to tell family and\nfriends the very personal details that the member was\npersuaded to reveal to their tutor. Another being to\ndrain their band account using blank cheques.\nNeedless to say the leaders of the cult are very rich.\nLike the Moonies they have twisted the Bible to suit\ntheir own means. We would strongly recommend that\nall and sundry avoid their bible studies in Evelyn\nGardens.\nClaire Millar, Aero Eng 2,\nSteve King, Civ Eng 3.\nDear Dave,\nI am writing to complain about the letters page of\nlast week's FELIX. In the past, you have printed letters\nfrom many viewpoints, explaining why people should\nthink in a certain way. Last week, however, you\neffectively refused to print any more letters from\nChristians.\nThere are Christians at IC, and FELIX should\nrepresent us as well as any other group in College. For\nyou to decide that the Christian viewpoint is not a valid one is blatantly usurping your position as editor.\nI appreciate that you may be unable to print all the\nletters you receive, but you cannot just exclude a point\nof view because you yourself disagree with it.\nI find your attitude towards Christianity in general\noffensive. You have stated in the past that you\nappreciate all viewpoints on an issue except for the\nChristian one; you have continually made fun of any\nChristian content in FELIX; and finally last week you\nopenly insulted all Christians and threatened to ban\nthem from your paper entirely. Surely you can see that\nthis bigotry is out of place.\nTom Di Giovanni, a Christian in Maths 1.\nI have not banned Christians from writing to\nFELIX. This week, I have printed your letter and\nothers. What I have bemoaned is the evangelical\nspreading of the word which has littered the\nletters pages of late\nEd.\nAshtray\nOffice\nDear Dave,\nI can't let Roy Adam's letter of last week go by\nunchecked. I dispute the inference made by Mr Adams\nthat his opinion is widely shared.\nEver since HUB started, it has been the source of\nmuch mystery to staff and students alike. Perhaps Mr\nAdams could list the 'many and diverse roles the HUB\nOffice plays in College life'. I can think of very few.\nThe fact that any spring to mind is only because I spent eighteen months working a few offices down\nfrom Clare Ash.\nClearly, the point of my original letter has been\nmissed. Whatever one's perspective of HUB, good or\nbad, it must be considered as a luxury. Our careers\nservice is not a luxury it is a basic necessity.\nAs Mr Adams states, 'The College....benefits by the\nactivities of the HUB Office'. The College may well\ndo, but students do not. I have long held the belief\nthat Imperial exists to provide for its student body.\nPerhaps that's just a juvenile attitude.\nCheers,\nPaul Shanley.\nPage 15\n\n"

    "content": "Imperial College Union's Dramatic Society host a plethora of talent at the Edinburgh Fringe each summer.\nNow is the time for you to become a part of it. Adrian Pagan reports....\nFringe benefit\nThe Edinburgh Fringe Festival is the biggest festival\nof its kind in Europe. Actors are supposedly 'spotted',\nthe dedicated rustle up theatres from church halls in\na matter of days and the nearest guesthouse vacancy\nis in Glasgow...\nThe Theatre West End (TWE) introductory buffet\nlast March was about as successful as Pamella\nBordes' chastity belt; the posters were put up the day\nbefore, someone accidentally wiped half the\nintro duct ury video and a mere four new adherents\nturned up, one of whom was looking for Wargaming\nSociety. Two months later, the auditions for Theatre\nWest End Productions (TWEP-the acting side of the\nEdinburgh Tour) things weren't much better: we\nneeded eight actors, and there were eight audition ees, one of whom was Spanish and must have had a working English vocabulary of less than 100 words.\nAll was not yet lost, however. By May our\nadministrator Zoe' had managed to sell all but two of\nthe twenty-one show slots in the theatre we were\ngoing to build, to other unsuspecting drama groups.\nTWE's credentials are, in fact, fairly impressive:\ncentral location on the main throbbing thoroughfare,\nexcellent technical facilities, the largest student run\nvenue on the Fringe, etc...etc...So we had no real\nproblems with finances (unlike so many other\ncompanies), we just needed people to come and build\nthe theatre that we'd already part sold to all those\ntheatre groups.\nIn the last week of June our skeleton crew of actors\nstarted rehearsals for the two plays we were taking\nup. Huis Clos, or No Way Out, by Jean-Paul Sartre,\nabout three dead people stuck in a psychological hell\nof their own making, was purportedly our 'Arty-Farty'\nplay and Funeral Games by the infamous Joe Orton\n(sexual innuendo, adultery and religious humbug) was\nto be our 'bums-on-seats' play. For three evenings a week over five weeks our thespians rehearsed shows\nthat Joe Public would be paying 'real money' to\nwatch. Props had to be gathered, costumes found,\npublicity prepared, sets built and double gins bought\nfor the directors on more than one occasion; but once\nwe'd thrown everything into the seven tonne Ryder\nTruck we'd hired, there was little more we could do\nthan pray or blackmail the critics in advance.\nEveryone arrived exactly a week before the festival\nbegan. Miraculously everything went according to\nplan, and better. The scaffolding, extra lights and\nemergency lights all arrived in time and with the actors\nhelping build the venue as well we turned a gro tty church hall into a sparkling professional theatre in\nunder three days. Meanwhile a merry band of\npublicists raided Edinburgh sticking wo d ges of leaflets\nand posters in every hole and orifice they could find.\nThe day before our first show, we were paid a visit\nby Mid-Lothian fire and safety inspectorate who\ngranted us a Theatre Licence, so now we could\nofficially open our doors to the public and our\nsub letters. The three weeks of the Festival saw an interesting\nvariety of actors passing through our venue ranging\nfrom the business-like 'professionals' who voice\ntelephone weather messages for 'Weathercall' to a group of bankrupt students from Exeter whose\nappalling modern day version of McB (the Scottish\nplay) won the dubious 'best of the worst' award in\none newspaper. When you're in Edinburgh during the\nfestival, variety's the name of the game. In total,\n1008 different shows were on offer over the three\nweeks not to mention the Festival proper, the Book\nFestival and the Jazz Festival.\nThirty years ago the Fringe saw the likes of Alan\nBennett and Dudley Moore in their celebrated revue\nBeyond the Fringe and even Rowan Atkinson made\nhis name there. Now you can go and see people like\nJulian Clary, The Doug Anthony All-Stars, Alan Bates\nand Jeremy Hardy for less than half the price you'd expect to pay if you were in London. Edinburgh is very\ncompact so you can fit an astronomic amount into one\nday.\nEdinburgh nightlife makes that centred around\nImperial look like a Monday night in Vladivostok. Pubs\nin Scotland close no earlier than midnight and the very\npopular Fringe Club closes at 3am. Last year our flat\nwas a fifteen minute stagger away from the Fringe\nClub and it was almost impossible to get lost.\nEdinburgh University Students' Unionis the ideal spot\nas well: it's got two cheap restaurants, a cabaret bar\n(where you can see a goodly sample of the latest\ncabaret on offer for free), several other bars, games\nrooms and a thronging disco that plays Tainted Love\nat midnight. Newspaper vendors set up shop in the\nfoyer flogging countless copies of The Scotsman to\nyoung thespians hoping to see their names in lights.\nThis gives rise to either whoops of joy or sour faces\nwhen their acting is called 'wooden' or 'dead meat'.\nSurprisingly, our shows seemed to fare rather well\nboth in 'bums-on-seats' and arty-far tyne s s. Funeral\nGames was two people short of a full house (120) one\nnight and Huis Clos got two smashing reviews: the\nfirst in The Scotsman commented that 'Students from\nImperial College London admirably succeeded' and the\nsecond in Review '89 used the words 'outstanding',\n'powerful' and 'enjoyable' which were then plastered\nall around the outside of the venue to lure extra public\nin. Overall TWE made a considerable profit, whereas\nmost groups expect to make a loss.\nDarlings, MARVELLOUS just wasn't the word!\nIf you're at all interested in coming up to the 1990\nFringe with our jolly crew, either as a dedicated\ntechnician, an actor or just a pair of willing hands\ncontact Zoe Hellinger or Helen Roberts c/o Dramsoc\nStoreroom (4th Floor, right hand staircase, Union\nBuilding) or on internal 3533.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Miracle Legion/The Breeders/\nThe Candyskins\nTo say that the Candyskins lack a certain enthusiasm\nfor their art is an understatement. They look like they\nwould have more fun clocking into the factory on a Monday morning. This is quite surprising. Where the\nattitude is all sneer, the music is sweet and pure\njangle-pop. The Candyskins have toned it down to a fine art. 'Here we come, walking down the street.'\nThe Candyskins sound like the Monkees.\nSpeaking of such similarities, the first thing you'll\nnotice about the Breeders is that they sound a lot like\nthe Pixies. The second thing is that the singer looks\na bit like, could almost be...actually is Kim Deal, bass\nplayer with the aforementioned combo, doing her own\nthang 'as it were, and unavoidably flexing her\nmonumental Pixie muscles in the process. Oh, and the\nblonde lassie on the left is Tanya from Throwing\nMuses.\nA good recipe for adulation, you may think. And\nthat's half the problem. It's a tribute to the Pixies that\nthe Breeders went down so well. It's also a tribute to\nMs Deal herself; she may be the star pupil of the Black\nFrancis School of Songwriting but the Breeders are\na damn fine band. The forthcoming Allini (who else?)\nproduced album should be a cork er.A rare and\nunexpected treat.\nHowever impromptu the Breeders' appearance\nshould have been, news like that has a leaky\nten dancy. Miracle Legion, once crowned the new\nRickenbacker messiahs in the wake of REM's uneasy\nand un accessible Fables and their own near-perfect\nSurprise Surprise Surprise, take the stage with a couple of sizeable mountains to climb. Trimmed down\nto an acoustic two-piece, they're not making life easy\nfor themselves.\nThe opening lines of The Heart is Attacked seemed\nshaky and nervous. Miracle Legion don't even look\nIslington Powerhaus\ncapable of a decent assault on the foothills. Soon\nthough, they were in full flow, Mark Mulcahey\nprancing around the stage like a demented pansy, that\nbeautifully fragile voice positively soaring. He may\nlook like a lumbering village idiot but close your eyes\nand he's an angel. Mulcahey's voice provides all the\nexcuses you want for placing Miracle Legion head and\nshoulders above other state-of-the-art REM\nsubstitutes.\nMuch of the back catalogue was given the acoustic\ndusting down that night. This really suits some songs\n(like the gorgeous Little Man), though many more ache\nfor a real band. Miracle Legion were playing to the\nconverted, and we loved it, but they're not winning\nmany new friends. Please, please come back guys,\nbut please, please don't forget to bring a band next\ntime.\nGraham L. Birdland\nNever could they get their live sound, where they are\nso successful, down onto vinyl. They even sound\ndifferent, Robert actually tries to sing and loses his\nsincere Cov accent and the guitar, bass and drums\nsound like a relic from The Ramones. Sleep with Me\nis nice enough and definitely has commercial appeal\nas proved by its entry at 39 in the Network\n(Mainstream) charts. But for anyone familiar with the\nearlier sounds of Paradise or Hollow Heart this just\ndoesn't compare.\nWanted is better-but not good enough.\nAll Over Me is very heavy but lacks everything.\nFinally Stay, previously available only on 1000\ncopies of amis press of Paradise (if anyone's got one,.\nI 'll buy it!), is a much mellower, a redeemer if even\nthere was.\nOn the limited 7\" EP the extra tracks are Hollow\nHeart and Sleep with Me (acoustic versions). Both are\ntotally different to their normal style and seem to suit\nboth tracks excellently.\nRobert's voice begins as unsure and seems to\nwaver as if frustrated, but by Sleep with Me he is\ntotally convincing and the track is a zillion times better\nthan the electric version.\nSod the 7\" and 12\" unless you're a devotee, just\ngo straight for the limited 7\", but be quick. For 'real'\nBirdland a copy of the Birdland Live, or see them live,\nnone of this vinyl is a substitute.\n7\" and 12\"\nThe Trudy\nCamden Palace\n6/02/90\nThey have to be seen to be believed. Even the limited\nstage at Camden Palace was, well, psychedelic with\nswirling lights and two 3 foot ballon s. Was that a drummer or a multi coloured alien from the planet\nMoron?\nThe zany music got even the Camden crowd\ndancing dangerously from the first note. Then\nsuddenly, Melissa (vocals) was miraculously\nteleported to the mike, and what wasn't she wearing?\nShe is renowned for her taste in underwear. The new\nbacking vocalist/dancer, in body-hugging chain mail,\nlived up to Melissa's crazy reputation. How can two\npeople act like that on stage and still keep a straight\nface? We couldn't and it was brilliant.\nThe set included the favourites Teenage Firebomb,\nLiving on a Moon and Kiss, Kiss, Kiss (set to be the\nnew single). Melissa confided; 'I like this one because\nI get to s nog lots of boys in the video'. Melissa, we\nlove you.\nSJH.\nBob Dylan\nBob Dylan, protest singer, rock poet and iconoclastic\nhobo, played Hammersmith Odeon on Tuesday as part\nof a week-long string of sold-out gigs. Along with a motley mass of young punks, reformed old hippies and\nrespectable middle-aged ladies and gentlemen, I took\nmy stance right at the back of the Odeon and awaited\nthe show. I had the cheapest of tickets, a \u00a32 can of\nGrolsch and the greatest of expectations. These were\nnot let down.\nAlthough, at 48, Dylan the enigma is fading, his\nPage 6.\nmagic certainly lives on. There is nothing else quite\nlike him on offer. Rapturous shrieking and applause\ngreeted his entrance on stage, and continued at full\nintensity throughout the evening. He played a sharp,\nsimple and well performed set, including such classics\nas Memphis Blues and a remarkable version of All\nAlong the Watchtower. Perhaps the highlight of the\ngig was during his acoustic intermission when we\nwere treated to a brilliant show of technical ability on\nthe guitar; and of course Mr Tamborine Man, that\nHammersmith Odeon\n5/02/90\nwhining harmonica, and that grating ly familiar drawl.\nAfter an hour and a half of steady blues and rock\n'n' roll, the audience demanded an encore with howls\nof ecstasy. This was received in due course, with\nstamping, singing and general jumping up and down.\n(Unusual, due to the age and demean our of some of\nthe participants!) I left with my head spinning.\nWonderful, a good time was had by all.\nDermot McKee.\n\n"

    "content": "Family Business\nThe publicity photos suggest this is ah ilia riou s gangster movie. It isn't. Family Business is a sympathetic exploration of the father-son relationship.\nTaken as such it will not disappoint. However it is\nun for u nate that this publicity was needed to draw the\ncrowds as it will lead to disenchantment with the film.\nThree big names star; Matthew Broderick, Dustin\nHoffman and Sean Connery. They play three\ngenerations of the McMullen Family in this low key\ncomedy drama.\nWhat happens? Connery is a small time crook, who\nhas brought up his son Hoffman to be a criminal.\nHoffman, however, wanted a middle-class upbringing\nfor his own son, Broderick. Thus Hoffman left the\nFamily Business to become a meat wholesaler.\nUnfortunately at the age of 23, Broderick decides to\nrebel -he rejects the values of his father and assumes\nthe criminal standards of his grandfather. It is apparent\nthat Hoffman's middle-class morals are merely a pretence, at heart he is a thief. Hoffman is then\nemotionally blackmailed into a robbery with Broderick\nand Connery. Surprise, surprise, Broderick gets\ncaught. Up to this point the film has been plausible ~\nbut Broderick's capture is utterly unconvincing. When\nhe hears the sirens in the distance he freezes-unlikely\nfor an MIT undergrad.\nThe rest of the film concerns itself with the\ndilemmas facing Hoffman, the trial and Connery's demise in gaol. These scenes were touching and\nhelped enormously by the acting, The film relies\nheavily on the stars to bring the very two-dimensional\nscript alive.\nConnery and Hoffman are both experienced screen\nplayers, but Broderick never seems out of his depth.\nHe has great presence and certainly holds his own.\nBroderick is being nursed to stardom by Tri-Star\nPictures, the makers of Family Business. This is the\nfirst of three movies that will broaden his appeal.\nSoon, in The Freshman, he will co-star with Marlon\nBrando-quite a casting achievement.\nDespite the film being a vehicle for Broderick and\nhaving a preoccupation with Hoffman's height and\nnose size, the film deserves consideration. It is also\ngood to see Connery playing a Scotsman and for once\nnot having to draw on his wide range of accents.\nSomehow, although enjoyable, the film misses the\nboat. It doesn't know if it is a com dy, drama or tear-jerk er...I am sure the big names will ensure box office\nsuccess, but I feel this may turn out to be another\nIshtar for Hoffman.\nFamily Business opens at the Odeon Leicester\nSquare and other selected theatres today.\nCharles Tomkins.\nHoney, I Shrunk the Kids/TUmmy Trouble\nWayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) has been beavering\naway in his attic building a size reduction device, to\nthe detriment of his marriage. Unfortunately, the\nmachine doesn't work. Then one day, while Wayne\nis away being ridiculed by the scientific establishment,\none of the kids from next door hits his baseball into\nthe attic, jolting the machine. When the kids go to\nretrieve the ball, they get that horrible shrinking\nfeeling...Life isn't easy when you're a quarter of an\ninch tall, as the most common-place objects become\nthreats.\nAll the ingredients for a kids' movie are here. The\nprolific Rick Moranis, recently seen in Ghostbusters\nII and Parenthood, does a great job of portraying the\nsplendidly dotty scientist, and Matt Freuer, best\nknown as Max Headroom, is equally good as his\nsports mad neighbour Big Russ Thompson, who is\nincapable of understanding his kids. There is the\nteenage couple, whom everyone knows are going to\nend the film in love, the punk kid who becomes nice\nby the end, and the couple of 'cute' animals (namely\na dog and an ant (?)).\nThe real scene stealer though, is Robert Oliveri as\nNick Szalinski. A beautiful bit of casting-he actually\nlooks like Moranis, his film father and he gets all the\nbest lines: 'I don't think we're in Kansas anymore,\nToto', 'I don't think we're in the food chain anymore,\nDorothy'.\nThe whole thing comes together as a very amusing\nwhole. The adults make total fools of themselves as\nthey search for the missing kids and the children\nthemselves provide the drama as they ride bees and\nants, fight off scorpions and camp out in a lego brick.\nThe special effects, as one would expect from\nIndustrial Light and Magic, are superb, which is just\nas well, as without them the film would be laughable.\nA good, if undemanding film, which is worth\nconsidering if the coursework is getting you down.\nMind you, it's worth paying the admission just to see\nW \u00bb. ~ h the Roger Rabbit short Tummy Trouble. A hill a riou s romp, with Baby Herman swallowing a rattle and\nbeing rushed to hospital ('St Nowhere'). Of course,\nwe have the usual chaos of any cartoon. Mind you,\nI'm probably biased as it features a cameo by my all\ntime favourite cartoon character, Droopy.\nAdam T. Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Hockey\nIC 1st XI \u20149 QMC 1st XI0 After much confusion about the 3rd's UAU match\nwith Sheffield, the men's1st team finally set about\ntheir task of defeating QMC, normally one of our\nclosest rivals in the league. The game was very even\nin the first half until Hari Vamadevan broke through\nin the last minute to set up Mark Landon for his first\nof the game. Literally seconds later IC scored again\nto make it 2-0 at half time.\nIn the second half IC started to play the kind of\nhockey it has only shown in bursts, completely\ndominating a lacklustre QMC side.\nMark Landon added 3 more to his first half tally and\nColin Wright blasted in 2 from the left wing. The\nmidfield supremo Phil Studds scored his first goal for\nthe club after good work from Mike Marshall.\nRounding off IC's best performance to date was our\nfinal goal of the 9 from Gary Knaresborough, who was\nvery pleased with an excellent team performance.\nFootball\nIC 6th s2 St Thomas' 2nds1 After striding onto the pitch twice and finding no valid\nopposition (rain and wind permitting), the gallant IC\n6th s emerged from the dressing room to dispatch the\nopposition in style.\nThe first half saw some amazing skills, but the\nforwards managed to continue their glorious run of\nsquandered chances. The defence was rarely\ntroubled, and starting the second half, IC's left back\nRobbie Rocket powered a shot just wide to shock us\nall. Keeping cool, the 6th s continuously attacked\ndown the left, and with ten minutes to go, Lilo Lally\nlatched on to a great pass to slide the ball home for\nthe deserved lead.\nWith the opposition still recouping, Phil superbly\nrounded their goalie, and surprisingly decided not to\nmiss the open goal, putting IC in a commanding\nposition. Gigolo Jon, dreaming of pacific beauties,\ngave away a corner from which they scored a worthless goal as the final whistle blew not a minute\nlater. We then snuffed out our Davey lamps and\ndanced the merry dance of merry men victorious.\nIC ll-IO) 0\nNew II won 4-2 on penalties\nNew ll-IO) 0\nThe victory champagne turned sour for IC on\nWednesday after an unexpected defeat in the semifinal of the cup. Having beaten New College three\ntimes already this season, including a32 win with\nnine men and a61 win the previous Saturday, IC\nwere perhaps a bit over-confident.\nOn a cold and wet day, and small and heavy pitch\nthe teams set to their task. For a moment IC thought\nthey were in the wrong game with many of the New\nplayers looking very unfamiliar! (Could there be\nringers; I 'll let you decide.)\nThe game itself was hard fought. IC had more of\nthe game and the better chances, with clear efforts\nfalling to G Phiri and A Jalan. But it was not IC's day\nand we were rather unkindly sent out of the\ncompetition on two penalties after half an hour of\ngruelling extra time.\nPage 12\nUAU quarter final\nIC 3rds5 Sheffield 3rds At the second attempt amidst the howling gales and\nfalling masonry, IC 3rds came face to face with\nSheffield University 3rds in the UAU quarter final. The\nfirst ever IC team to progress this far started the\nmatch with skill and flair which belied their 3rd team\nstatus.\nA dream start saw captain, Kevin Hill, calmly slot\nthe ball past the stranded Sheffield keeper to the\nobvious delight of the large crowd. With the home\nsupporters cheering there was no looking back and\nthe second and third goals shortly followed courtesy\nSupport\nRugby\nIn last Sunday's semi final of the Gutteridge Cup, IC's1 st XV rugby side won easily against a KCH team that\nfailed to make use of a gale blowing in their favour\nin the first half. At half-time with the score level at\n6-6, it was obvious that IC would take control, which\nthey did and scored a further five tries. They will now\nmeet St Thomas Hospital in the final on Sunday Feb\n25 at Motspur Park. The Gutteridge Cup is the\nknockout competition between all London College and\nHospital sides. To win this would confirm IC as one\nof the top college teams in London, and -would be a fair reflection of the standard of the game played here.\nLike many other sports, at IC, however, the\ncommitment from players is seldom reflected in the\nsupport from other members of College, with the\nnotable exception of the RSM bottle match. This is\nnot surprising since going to watch one of the teams,\ninvolves a five hour round trip to Harlington and a lot\nof wasted time.\nWe hope the Gutteridge Cup final will be an\nopportunity to change this and for any interested\nparties to come along and support the team, and join\nthe (victory) celebrations afterwards. Support is\nalways appreciated but never more so than for an\nimportant match like this. It may also be a chance to\ndiscover that the players are not the stereotypical\ndrunken louts that are sometimes seen around College\nbars. Alternatively it may well confirm it, but come\nanyway. Lists will be put up on the sports noticeboard\nin the Union so that you can sign up and we can\narrange transport.\nWe look forward to seeing you.\nof Jon Briggs and then the well drilled short corner\nroutine of Justin Holdsworth pushing, iain McGovern\nstopping and Kevin striking. At this point IC relaxed\ninto their normal style of good clean astro hockey with\nScott Hipkins reeking havoc on the left wing and Matt\nWong, Chris Maury and Jason Curry stifling any\nSheffield attacks.\nTwo further goals by Scott Hipkins sealed\nSheffield's fate and a place in the semi-finals for the\n3rds next Wednesday. All supporters are welcomed\nfor the match against Bristol University on February\n14, at Paddington astroturf at 3.30pm. Squash\nThe Ladies Squash Team played their last sixteen\nmatch in the UAU Championships this Wednesday\nagainst Essex who had come through the challenge\nrounds. After a slight hi c up in locating the\nwhereabouts of the visiting team and then in locating\nthe squash courts, due to some stair repairs going on\nin the Sports Centre, the match started with the fourth\nand fifth ranked matches. Both Han-Bing Choong and\nJenny Jolliffe won very easily as they have done\nthroughout the championships. The second and third\nplayers, Alison Smith and Toni Perrot followed up with\nanother two convincing victories to secure api ace for\nIC in the quarter finals. This left just Liz Parkin's match\nto go and she went on court already knowing the team\nhad won. She had perhaps the hardest match of the\nday but still won overwhelmingly. The Imperial girls,\nrather unfortunately, now play.Loughborough in the\nlast eight.\nResult\nImperial-5 Essex-0\nRifle\nOn Wednesday January 31, six members of Imperial's rifle squad shot against a team of six from Reading\nUniversity at IC's range in the Sports Centre. After\na tense match lasting two hours, IC emerged\nvictorious with a score of 570 against Reading's538.J Primrose, IC's team captain didn't help much by\nshooting a spectacularly bad score of 92. Hopefully\nthere will be a rematch in the not so distant future.\n\n"

    "content": "Yaaba\nIn a village in Burkino Faso lives Bila, a young boy. He\nbefriends an old lady, derided as a witch by the rest\nof the village, calling her 'Yaaba'-meaning\ngrandmother.\nThrough his child's eyes we see a slightly\nstereotypical view of the adult world; with affairs,\nmarriage break-ups and petty rivalries all going on\naround him. Then when his cousin catches tetanus\nfrom a dirty knife, in a fight, he has to appeal to Yaaba\nfor help, yet only the village drunk believes in here,\nthe rest maintaining their prejudices.\nIdrissa Ouedraogo has directed a beautifully simple\ntale of life in an African village, which, although based\non a culture very different to our own, still relates to\nthe problems of our society in a very relevant way.\nAs the story gently unfolds, we are presented with\nmyriad examples of the stupidity of adult society,\nwhich it takes the eyes of a child, or a drunk, to see.\nSuperstition, prejudice and love are all observed by\nBila, initially with little comprehension, but as his\nrelationship with Yaaba develops, so does his\nunderstanding of the world.\nThe action is played against a backdrop of the\nAfrican landscape; dry, empty plains dotted with the\noccasional tree or bush. In this background the human\nseems to be just about the only animal, living life close\nto nature, which we are all part of.\nBeautifully shot, acted and simple but enthralling,\nit is little wonder that this film won the International\nCritics prize at Cannes. See it now!\nReviews Department handy tip of the week-Yaaba is only showing at the Renoir, Brunswick\nSquare (nearest tube Russell Square). The cheapest\nway to see it is to go to the earliest showing (2.35pm daily) and wave your ULU or ICU card about. That way\nyou'll get in for a mere \u00a3 1.70 instead of the usual \u00a34.\nAdam T. Rooftops\n'Good view, low rent, plenty of light: just what\neverybody in this city wants.' Where is this ideal\nproperty? It's a rooftop, high above the streets of\nManhattan's Lower East Side.\nIn this area live several kids who have no family to\ndepend on, and make the best they can of life. For\nentertainment they go to an empty lot called the\n'Garden of Eden', where they dance, laugh and\ngenerally have a good time. Here they also 'combat\ndance', trying to force each other off a raised\nplatform, through acrobatic movement, without\ntouching each other.\nForemost among the dances, is a chap improbably\nnamed T, who falls in love with Elana, when she\nvisits a frei nd in the Garden of Eden. Unfortunately\nshe turns out to be the look-out for a drugs dealer\u2014\nwho, coincidental^ turns out to be the same drugs\ndealer who is trying to drive T from his home, so he\ncan use it to peddle his evil merchandise.\nSo we have a 'heart warming' tale of kids with\nproblems; one kid's mother is a prostitute, another has\na father brain-damaged through boxing and even T is an orphan. Unfortunately the whole thing is terribly\npredictable. Love triumphs through adversity (yawn),\nrevenge for a murdered friend (snooze), bad die gets\nhis come-up pan ce( snore).\nOf course all this is interspersed with dance scenes\nand played against a background of music, mostly by\nDavid A Stewart of the Eurythmics and Pink Floyd\nproducer Michael Kamen.\nTo give the film its due, the dance sequences are\nbeautifully choreographed, and the music is good. The\nacting and photography are competent and the\natmosphere of the Alphabet City nicely caught. But\nthe plot and script are so chic he ridden that the film\nmust remain one for devotees of this sort of film only.\nThe film is showing at Canon Haymarket, Oxford\nStreet and Chelsea from today.\nAdam T. Blaze\u2014Opens 23rd February\nSet in the state of Louisiana, Blaze recounts the\nscandalous romance of Governor Earl K Long and\nstripper Blaze Starr. This unlikely combination of a65 year old married politician and a28 year old\nflamboyant girl, along with Earl's progressive ideas,\nrocked the Southern political machine.\nFannie Belle Fleming (Lolita Davidovich) was born\nduring the depression and was raised in the hills of\nWest Virgina. It was her encounter with the Quonset\nHut club in Washington DC that first introduced her\nto a life of stripping and gave her her stage name-'Blaze Starr'. By the time she met Earl Long in 1959,\nshe had a reputation for her flashy and daring stunts\non stage.\nGovernor Earl K Long is played by Paul Newman.\nAt the beginning of the film, I didn't think that he was\na good choice as it's difficult to see 'the Earl', as Long\nwas known, rather than the actor. His grating voice\ndidn't help either. I never really forgot that it was\nNewman on the screen, but as the story unfolded, it\ndidn't matter.\nLolita Davidovich has a hard time holding her own\nwith Newman, but is undoubtedly the star of the film.\nShe is helped by Blaze's innocence and honesty which\nmake her shine next to Earl Long.\nBlaze is based on a few chapters from the\nautobiography Blaze Starr: My Life As Told To Huey\nPerry. It's not a strict historical documentary-the\ncircumstances surrounding Long's short stay in\nMandeveille State Hospital have been simplified for\nthe film, and the romance has been polished. Even so,\nthe research into the era has paid off, with a film that\nis as enjoyable to watch for the colourful background\nas it is for the machinations of the statesmen of the\ntime.\nBefore television, politicians didn't have to worry\nabout their personal lives being scrutinised. Besides\nthe dark dealings and the vote generating walk about s, it was considered natural for them to visit strip joints,\nand Earl does. One night he meets Blaze and tries to\nbed her like all the other girls. When she stubbornly\nrefuses, he sees her as a lady worth pursuing, and\nslowly they fall in love.\nIf the political times are one fascination, another\nmust be the costumes. Blaze Starr herself, who\nappears in the film as Lilly, still has a lot of her original\ndresses. These formed the basis for some, er,\ninteresting costumes which liven up the film.\nBlaze is an enjoyable film which isn't too taxing on\nthe brain. If your're undecided on what to see, you\nwon't go far wrong with this.\nToby Jones.\nPage 4\n\n"

    "content": "Amnesty letters Phoenix\nIn 1961 the British lawyer Peter Benenson published\nan article denouncing the imprisonment of thousands\nof men and women everywhere for expressing their\nopinions, and urged people to react. The cold war was\nat its height, and the gloom of nuclear war hung in\nthe skies. The barely disguised conflicts b tween the\nsuperpowers provoked and inflamed regional conflicts\nworld-wide. Reports of human rights violations in\ncountries of all political colours were heard\neverywhere, and in the circumstances it is not\nsurprising that Peter Benenson's article set off a powerful reaction. Amnesty International was\nfounded, and people were presented with\nconstructive action they could follow to relieve the\nhuman rights situation.\nThe organisation has grown and now encompasses\n700,000 members in 150 countries, represented by\nan elected governing body, the International Council.\nAmnesty International's original statute sets out its\nobjectives which are 'to secure throughout the world\nthe observance of the provisions for prompt and just\ntrials, for the release of prisoners of conscience, and\nfor an end to the death sentence and the practice of\ntorture world-wide'. 'Prisoners of conscience' are\ndefined as those imprisoned solely for their beliefs.\nWhen Amnesty is told of an arrest, the first step\nis to investigate the case to make sure there are no\nreasonable grounds for detention, as in the case of\na detain ee who advocates violence. The staff of 240\nin the London-based research department sift through\ninformation relevant to the case such as press reports,\ntrial transcripts and statements from witnesses.\nMissions are occassional^ sent to find facts directly.\nIf no case for detention can be made, the prisoner is\n'adopted' as a prisoner of conscience, and put on\nAmnesty's campaign list. The last and greatest\nobstacle to getting someone released is persuading\nthe gaol ers that they were wrong to lock up the\nprisoner in the first place, or to make them so\nuncomfortable as to force them to open the prison\ngates.\nSeveral methods have proved their worth over the\nyears. The most famous involves the letter writing\ncampaigns which submerge government ministries\nand embassies with floods of letters from individuals\ngiving reasoned demands for the release of a particular\nprisoner. All other actions public ising cases, such as\nvigils at embassies, are used.\nAn example is the campaign launched last week by\nImperial College's own Amnesty group. It is one of\nonly two student groups in the UK to be allocated its\nown prisoner of conscience, and has been\ncampaigning on his behalf for a year now. The prisoner\nis Alaattin Sahin, a Turkish chemical engineer\nincarcerated for journalistic activities in various small\npublications. Shortly after the September 1980\nmilitary coup, he was sentenced to life imprisonment\n(reduced to 38 years on appeal) for distributing\ncommunist propaganda and inciting crime. Amnesty's subsequent enquiry found no evidence to justify the\narrest and the Imperial College Amnesty group will be\nholding a letter writing stall every Thursday lunchtime\nin the JCR. Written letters are provided, and passersby can read and sign them. The group then sends the\nsigned letters to the relevant authorities, ministers or\npresidents. The Turkish government is particularly\nsensitive to criticism since it would like to join the EEC,\nbut has been rejected, partly because of its dubious\nhuman rights record.\nThe Imperial group is a good example of how the\n3,800 local groups world-wide operate. It meets every\nTuesday to inform members on details of any urgent\naction the central British Section may have sent\ninformation about, and which may need immediate\nattention. Letters are written, coffee drunk and\nstrategies thought up.\nThe group has just brought a death penalty\ncampaign to a close. This concentrated on the seven\ncountries who carry out the greatest number of\nexecutions every year, and again involved a lot of\npostage. The end of January saw a debate between\nthe Amnesty chairwoman and the Tory MP Tim\nJanman, with a motion in support of the death\npenalty. This was defeated by an overwhelming\nmajor irt y of the order of ninety per cent, after an\nanimated discussion.\nThe coming months will see a 'sponsored\nconcentration camp' for which sponsored individuals\nwill stay confined in a small corner of the JCR\nsurrounded by barbed wire for a day, with sponsors'\nmoney going mainly to the Post Office via Amnesty\nInternational. On a lighter note, there will be an\nentertainments evening with an African band and a speaker. Anyone interested should go to the top floor\nof the Union Building on Tuesday at 5.30pm Phoenix is the literary magazine of Imperial College.\nFounded in 1886 by HG Wells under the title The\nNormal Schools Science Journal it is now in its 103rd year after numerous changes to style and format. This\nyear, as last year, it will be published in a slim glossy\nbook format. As regards the contents, those will be\nentirely up to you.\nI will be grateful for anything vaguely artistic or\nliterary in nature, particularly short stories, poetry,\nphotographs and artwork, preferably as soon as\npossible.\nAnyone wishing to contribute, help in the\nproduction of Phoenix or discuss anything with me\ncan do so via the Phoenix pigeonhole in the FELIX\nOffice or the Physics pigeonholes. If you want to see\nwhat Phoenix is about pop into the FELIX Office where\nyou can get some back copies.\nChris T, Phoenix Editor 1990.\nWellsoc\nThe H.G. Wells Society (or WellSoc) is one of the\nlargest societies in College. As you probably know,\nH.G. Wells was himself at, what was to become,\nImperial College in the 1880s. Through failing his final\nyear he went into writing.\nThe Time Machine, The Invisible Man and War of\nthe Worlds are among the many books he wrote.\nBecause of his interest in both science and literature,\nour society is very general and we organise talks by\nguest speakers on almost any subject that interests\nthem. They are not all of a scientific nature. This year\nfor example, out of our nine talks so far, we have had\na talk by the author Terry Pratchett, talks on flying\nsaucers, the history of alchemy, para science, science\njournalism and on the relationship between religion\nand science.\nWe are currently showing the TV series The Prisoner\nand will be organising our annual Skirmish trip later\nthis term.\nIf any member would like to become more involved,\ncome along to our AGM which will be held on Monday\nFebruary 12, at 7.30pm in Physics LT1.\nPage 13\nTHE IC ARTS MAGAZINE\nPHOENIX\n1990\nNEEDS CONTRIBUTIONS!\nAll forms of poetry, prose, artwork, photographs,\ndrawings and any other bits and pieces welcome.\nAll contributions to the Phoenix Editor, FELIX Office.\n\n"

    "content": "Abridged letter\nDear Dave,\nI felt I had to write, after reading Mr Shanley's Delator Column in last week's FELIX (what a load of\nself-opinionated rubbish!). Some may remember Mr\nShanley's Blackmail column of two years ago, which\nrecklessly placed FELIX under the threat of legal\naction. This same Mr Shanley is now writing a series\nof idealistic, ill-informed articles in an offensively\narrogant style.\nLast term we were given Shan's answer to all of\nLondon Regional Transport's problems. Under his new\nefficient system, Mr Shanley would close all the\nstations with faulty lifts. This would save 80 year-olds\nbeing forced to use the stairs. (Stairs which, in the\nevent of a fire, they would be forced to use anyway!),\nThe stations would not be rep one ned until 100%\nreliable lifts had been installed!\nLast week we were treated to Shan's answer to\nBritain's football problems. In this article Mr Shanley\ncame up with such ridiculous proposals as\nreintroducing plastic pitches. If Mr Shanley knew\nanything about football or plastic pitches, he would\nknow that all the Clubs that have experimented with\nsynthetic pitches have now reverted to using grass!\nHis next outrageous suggestion was to change the\nrules on a National level to make football more\nexciting. (Quite how he would solve the problems that\nthis would cause British teams competing in\nInternational competitions he did not deign to inform\nus!) The present rules have worked well for many\nyears, and continue to do so practically everywhere\nin the world that football is played. Violence therefore\nwould appear to be Britain's problem, not football's. It would also interest me to know quite what rule\nchanges Mr Shanley would suggest. How would we\nmake football so much more interesting? Perhaps the\nshape of the ball should be changed, the players might\npick it up and run with it or would even shrink it and\nhit it with a stick...after all, synthetic pitches are\nperfect for hockey!\nMr Shanley may be sure that he has the answer to\nall the world's problems, but I am not. Furthermore\nI am tired of reading his opinions in FELIX.\nElection rules prevent me from concluding as I would have liked. Suffice it to say, that Mr Shanley's ill-informed and ill-thought out Delator column, is\nmerely an attempt to gain himself College-wide\npublicity, to satiate his outsized ego, and to present\nhimself as a well-balanced individual. He has certainly\nfailed with me, and probably with a large proportion\nof your readership as well.\nYours sincerely,\nJ M Scott, ICU Welfare Officer 1989/90.\nBrothel Not really a revisited prick\nDear Dave,\nAlthough I'm not a regular customer of the\n'metaphorical brothel around the corner', highlighted\nin last week's letters, I would like to give an alternate\nview to the bleak description presented.\nMost of us are in the same boat-behind with\nproblem sheets and finding the workload high: but\nImperial is well known for working its students hard.\nImperial degrees also carry an enviable reputation. Are\npeople naive enough to believe that these two facts\nare unrelated?\nAs for College life, I think last week's writer needs\nto get out more. I too have friends in universities\naround the country-not one had a Rag Week which\nwas a patch on ours. If some students don't appreciate what goes on here, at least other people\ndo: functions at IC seem to have an increasing, and\nwelcome, proportion of outsiders-going down to\nSouthside for a whiskey and American has taken on\na whole new meaning!\nCertainly there are problems with the courses as\nthey stand, and student criticism should be wielded\nto correct them-but the sort of sweeping\ngeneralisations being made are, to say the least,\nunproductive.\nIt's far easier to criticise College life than it is to get\nout and get involved. If the alleged hoard es of\ndisillusioned undergraduates put more effort into the\nlatter, they might find this place isn't so terrible after\nall.\nYours,\nJ Tennant-Smith, EE1.\nPage 16\nDear Mr Smedleyt\nI am writing to register my protest about your\ntreatment of the Imperial College Science Fiction\nSociety in the last issue of FELIX (No 857).\nIn recent issues you have repeatedly asked clubs\nand societies to advertise events in FELIX. Then,\nwhen ICSF Society provide you with a half page piece\nadvertising their annual one day convention you re title it 'Prickocon' and label Simon Bradshaw as Train\nSpotting Club Hon Sec'.\nBoth of these statements are in fact untrue. If this\nwas an attempt at humour I feel it was sadly\nmisplaced as it could cause a loss of membership at\na normally well attended event.\nIf it was not an attempt at humour it is very bad\njournalism. To edit an article due to lack of space or\nto stop offense being caused is one thing. To add a title which could offend and represents the views of\nthe editor and a number of his friends is quite another.\nFELIX is the Magazine of Imperial College Union.\nThe editor's opinions should be confined to the\neditorial. Other pieces should be accepted or rejected\non their merits and not altered by these opinions.\nYours,\nDavid Bate.\nOops! I nearly rejected your letter on its merits.\nHo, hum, as a budding journalist, I'm sure you\nknow what's best. I enclose your NUJ application\nform forthwith.\nEd.\nTrain of\nthought\nDear FELIX,\nRE P* ic*oc on8 What manner of shite is this. That was totally\nuncalled for. I can understand the orange cover edition\ncreated a lot of debate but this does nothing but\noffend a lot of people in one of IC's largest societies\n(if not the largest).

Your News Editor does it on his\nown l Oh, the poor lamb-where's his degree going?\nIs he being paid?\nI'm sure that there are other enquiring individuals\nin the College who would be able to corner rampant\nbureaucracy cringing in dark corners of the College.\nI'm sure that there would be people who'd love to\ncover such stories as naked schizophrenic women\nlurking about in the Sports Centre, ceilings collapsing\non unsuspecting students, thefts in the Union\nBuilding, malaria outbreaks in Southside Halls,\nbureaucracy gone mad in Sherfield, Westminster and\nthe room halls, more thefts in the Union Building, giant\nmutant amoebae from the Biology Department eating\nold cars in Prince's Gardens, thefts in the Union\nBuilding, chair crashing fights in the College bars,\nadministration casually stamping on students, flying\ntelevisions, thefts in the Union Building, and, of\ncourse, the continuing Student Loan saga.\nSuch reporters speak directly to the six thousand\ninmates of Imperial informing them and resulting in\ndecisions.\nI must immediately go to the FELIX Office and find\nout more.\nYours,\nAdam Harrington, FELIX News Editor.\n\n"

Business Manager: Stef Smith. Advertising Manager:\nRamin Nakisa Copyright FELIX 1990. ISSN 1040-0711\nAfro-Carribean Society Disco\nI was disgusted to hear of what had happened at this\nevent. In honesty, the drugs problem is not one which\nI see as crucial. A lot of people at IC smoke a little\ncannabis from time to time. It is a petty offence\ncompared to the robberies and hold-ups which took\nplace at last Friday's disco. This is the first time that\nIC has experienced this sort of behaviour and I hope\nit will be the last. Afro-carri bean Society are\nresponsible for the event and have proven themselves\nsadly lacking. They have been banned from using\nUnion rooms and they ought to have their income from\nthe Union reduced to zero for next year. IC Union\nshould not condone this sort of affair by helping in its\nfunding.\nOn a similar note, I was sorry to hear of an attack\non Union Manager Dave Peacock at the weekend. It\nseems London is full of thugs who take pleasure in\nviolence. This is the second time he has been mugged.\nThis time his attackers wanted his Vodaphone which\nhe surrendered, only to be beaten up for his assailants'\nsick pleasure. Maybe this has clouded my feelings on\nlast Friday's incidents. My only printable feelings on\nthe entire matter are, get well soon Dave.\nOn the question of violence at Imperial College, I have to query the judgement of last week's disciplinary hearing. To hand out paul try sentences of\nbans from Union and College facilities is shear folly.\nThe offenders fought in the Union Bar with bar stools.\nIn the real world, they would have received a fine and\na suspended sentence for such behaviour. To let\npeople off so lightly is to encourage such immature\nloutish ness. I have heard that the College's disciplinary board\ndoes not hand out fines since students cannot afford\nto pay them. They feel that the police should not be\ncalled since students are only growing up. It is about\ntime some people learnt how to grow up the hard way;\nthe way similar aged people learn in the outside world.\nSecurity Officer, Terry Briley, has told me that policy\nis now to call the police in connection with violent\noffences. It is sad that this farce.has had to occur to\nhighlight the problem of discipline at IC in this way.\nElections\nThose hack y racers will soon be pestering everybody\nfor their vote. If you are not standing for a sabbatical\npost, please skip this bit.\nBecause of the large number of candidates for ICU\nPresident, which has started to emerge I shall have\nto restrict the amount of time each candidate will have\nto prepare publicity. The FELIX office will be available\nfor candidates to prepare the artwork for their\npublicity on Saturday 17th and Sunday 18th February.\nAnybody wishing to use the print unit facilities for\npublicity should contact me by Wednesday 14th to\nbook a slot over this period. I estimate that each\ncandidate will be given a4 hour period. Anybody\nasking for publicity after this weekend will not be\nguaranteed my help or any privacy in the office.\nPublicity will be available on Friday 23rd February\nat 5.30pm.

    "content": "Strike!?\nThe Manufacturing, Science and Finance Trade Union\n(MSF) are contemplating strike action at Imperial\nCollege. The dispute is over seven members of\nCollege staff who may be made redundant following\nthe abolition of their current jobs.\nThe staff were working for Imperial Biotechnology\nLimited (IBT) which is a company set up by Imperial\nCollege. IBT was sold to the Australian firm Burns\nPhilp last year. The staff had worked for IBT for about\neight years, providing technical support in the pilot\nplant. IBT informed the staff and the College on\nWednesday 31st January that they no longer required\ntheir services.\nDr Trevor Langley, Managing Director of IBT,\nexplained that revenue from the pilot plant in the form\nof outside contracts had fallen and that the plant was\nmaking a loss. He said IBT had seen no way to\nincrease revenue and had therefore felt it necessary\nto cut both staff and costs. The staff now revert to\nbeing direct employees of I.C. and the college must\nfind alternative employment for them within College\nor make them redundant.\nDr Langley denied that the staff had been treated\nbrusquely. He said that IBT had employed the staff\nsince August 1982 and had 'kept them on when things\nhave been difficult before'. He claimed IBT had\ncomplied with the terms of their agreement with the\nCollege over the staff.\nMr Dollard, ex-chairman of Imperial's MSF said\n'all the MSF wants is guarantees that our members\nwill not be made redundant'. He said that if the\nCollege did not agree to this they would 'take the\nCollege and IBT all the way'. Plans include\nwithdrawing all technical support to IBT, which is\nsited on the South Kensington campus, including\npower, steam, oxygen and mechanical services. Mr\nLangley said he had received no notice of this action,\nbut that the College had told him that 'agreements'\nand services would still stand'. He said that if the MSF\ndid take action it would 'hurt some of the College\nservices we maintain as well'.\nIf the situation is not resolved members may take\nsecondary action with a strike in the spring with\npossible national MSF support and strike pay. Mr\nDollard said that he 'hoped it came to that' because\nhe believed that College was 'trying to establish a precedent for making people redundant'. The\ndecisions on the action were taken at a meeting of\nthe MSF on Monday.\nMr Rob Letham, IC's Senior Personnel Officer,\nsaid that College was 'trying to make alternative jobs\navailable, but couldn't guarantee that this would be\npossible'. He said that the staff were 'being given first\nshot at the most suitable jobs' and that they had\napproached the head of the Biochemistry Department,\nProfessor Barber, as this was the department most\nrelevant to their skills. He said that in the letter sent\nto the staff it was made clear that if they had not been\nfound other jobs by the end of April, the College\n'would have no alternative than to think about what\nwe do next, which could include a severance\narrangement'. Mr Dollard said this amounted to a redundancy notice, although Mr Letham denied this.\nMr Angus Fraser, Managing Director of Imperial\nCollege, said that he was 'obviously concerned' about\nthe threatened action 'particularly in the light of the\nefforts we've been making since the outset'. He said\nthat he could give no guarantee that the staff would\nnot be made redundant but that he felt the College\nhad 'made considerable progress to avoid that'. He\nwas 'optimistic that the worst fears of the MSF will\nnot be realised'.\nMr Letham said he had received a letter from the\nMSF describing in general terms the action they were\nParty muggings\nViolence and 'professional' drug pushing was\nwitnessed at the Afro-Caribbean Society function last\nFriday. Students were assaulted and robbed inside and\naround the Junior Common room (JCR) late in the\nevening of the function. There was one reported\nmugging in the public conveniences of the JCR.\nMr Terry Briley, security officer at I.C., said that\na private function held on the 20th January resulted\nin the police being called as drug peddling was\nobviously taking place. He claimed that possibly the\nsame group who were responsible for this were\ninvolved in last weeks offences.\nRobbers intimidated students, and the muggers were\ndescribed as two large black men who probably\nweren't students. They did not use weapons and\nmanaged to steal only a small amount of money from\nthe student concerned.\nMr Briley said that the 'police will be paying\nparticular attention to future functions and college\nlicences must be considered at risk'.\nHe added that it was the prompt action of the Bar\nManager, Mr Mike Smith, in calling the security\nguards to close down the event that prevented anything\nmore serious occurring. Mr Briley said he was\nplanning to take and that the MSF had warned that\nthey would be 'in dispute with College if College\ncould not guarantee staff not being made redundant'.\nHe claimed College was actively trying to avoid a dispute and had asked the MSF to co-operate with\nattempts to employ the staff elsewhere.\nMr Dollard said that the MSF were 'not interfering\nwith anything which the College was doing which was\nto the benefit of their members' but added that 'Mr\nLetham might have good intentions but the road to\nHell is paved with good intentions'. He added that\n\"'not one member of the MSF or the Association of\nScientific,.Technical and Managerial Staffs (ASTMS)\nhas ever been made redundant. Aston University tried\nand the MSF binned them'. He said that the MSF would 'band together nationally' to support IC MSF.\nMr Dollard also accused IC of 'ripping off the\nUniversity Funding Council (UFC) by claiming\nmoney to pay the staff from UFC whilst accepting\nmoney from IBT for the staff s services. He said that\nthe MSF would be writing to the UFC and to the\nAuditor General. Mr Letham said that the College\ndid not get money for particular members of staff from\nthe UFC. A spokesman for the UFC confirmed that\nthe grant was awarded on student numbers and\nresearch based criteria and that once the claim had\nbeen granted the UFC cul d not dictate the College's spending policy. He said that if the College wished\nto contract out staff they were entirely free to spend\nany money they might save elsewhere.\nMr Dollard said the MSF were also planning to\nwrite to the University Technicians National Advisory\nCommittee, the International Congress of Trade\nUnions and technicians at other coll lge s. He said they\nwere planning to organise a mass rally at Imperial\nin support of their action.\nMr Letham said he hoped to avoid a confrontation\nand pointed out that 'people have to make their own\nchoices about whether to accept alternative\nemployment or not'. Mr Fraser agreed that 'at the\nend of the day they have a choice about whether they\nconsider those jobs suitable or not'. Mr Dollard said,\n'It's scandalous. IC has one of the biggest groups in\nthe MSF. If they thought we'd stand back and take\nit, they must be the most incompetent managers out.\nThey should be sacked.'\n'gravely concerned' about both functions.\nMs Fiona Nicholas, Honorary Secretary of I.C. Union, said that the union was not accepting any\nfurther bookings from the Afro- Caribbean Society,\nthough the event they had already arranged for next\nweek would still go ahead, as it had been booked\nbefore the present troubles arose.\nMr Briley said that students have written to the\npolice expressing concern at the lack of supervision\nwhich the functions exhibited.\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "I Will computers ever be able to simulate the human brain?\nArtificial minds\nFor a long time, philosophers have believed that in a distinction between the mind and the ton. The brain\nis that massive and complicated network of neurons\nwhich is found in the vast majority of the animal\nkingdom. It is the brain which controls the 'instincts'.\nThe mind, on the other hand, is a concept. It controls\nthose traits we consider to be specific to ourselves:\nlogic, thought, creativity and emotion.\nRene Descartes (1596-1650) was the first\nproponent of the idea of a seperate brain and mind,\na philosophy known as 'dualism.' 'You cannot doubt\nyou have a mind,' he argued, 'as the very act of\ndoubting calls for you to have.' Hence the\nphilosophers' infamous phrase: 'Cognito ergo sum'-'l think, therefore I exist.'\nToday, scientists have evolved a new idea of mind,\nmore useful to Psychologists and Artificial Intelligence\n(Al) researchers alike. They see the mind as the effect\nof certain neural firing patterns, the results being\nthoughts and creativity.\nIt was inevitable that man's curiosity would\neventually lead him to wish to unravel the mysteries\nof the mind. If the latter definition of mind was\ncorrect, then would it not be possible to emulate the\nworkings of the mind? Nature has shown us that it\nis possible to do the same 'job' using different\n'machines', in the form of 'homo plastic' species. As\nan example, both birds and bats have wings, both can\nfly, but both have evolved quite separately. An\nanalogy can be drawn between the birds and the bats,\nand the mind and a computer model of the mind. Al\nresearchers began to design such models.\nAlan Turing was possibly the first scientist to set\nstandards by which a machine could be qualified as\n'Intelligent'. He stated that a machine could be\nclassified as 'Intelligent' if a human who was 'talking'\nto it, could not distinguish it from another human. This\nis the 'Turing Test',\nAn early example was the computer program,\nELIZA. Its inventor, Weizenbaum, allowed ELIZA to\ntalk to a number of people and found that, even after\nbeing told the truth, many insisted that they had\nconversed with another person.\nTuring's classification of 'Intelligence' was short\nlived. It was pointed out that computers are\n'syntactic', they take symbols and manipulate them\nin order to gain a result. This is the basis of a 'Turing\nMachine'. The mind, on the other hand, is 'semantic',\nfor each of the symbols, events etc presented to it,\nit attaches some meaning, co notation or inference. In\nreality, psychologists had known this for years.\nBartlett (1930) asked a number of subjects to\nmemo rise a passage of text. He showed that they only\nrecalled what they expected the passage to have said\nrather than what it actually said. It was concluded that\nman remembers abstracts of 'episodes' (known as\n'episodic memory'), stored 'semantically'.\nThis posed problems for the Al researchers, as they\nnow had to adapt their systems such that for any\nepisode or event, there were now numerous such\nsemantic references. The combination of Minsky,\nRummelhart and Ortony created a new model of the\nmind, including elements of choice, decision and\nmemory, known as SCHEMATA.\nThe limitations to this system are quite obvious, it\nPage 8\nis in no way a good representation of the mental\nprocesses. Unfortunately the Al establishment now\nfaced a problem. They had stretched their software\nto its limits and yet did not seem significantly nearer\nto a true model of the mind. Only one thing remained;\nthe hardware had to change. They started research\ninto Parallel Processing.\nThe early machines had been serial computers,\nprocessing information sequentially, one item at a time.Researchers began to concentrate on not only\nmodelling the mechanisms of the mind but moulding\nthe structure of their machines to that of the brain.\nThe brain differs from a serial computer most\nsignificantly by the fact that it can execute a few\nmillion processes simultaneously.\nThe need for par elle l processing is obvious. The new\nmachines were built from individual interconnected\n'neurons'. The 'neurons' are in fact small RAM\n(random access memory) circuits, each with a weighting and threshold level. The diagram gives a basic idea to a simple connection between three\n'neurons'. Individual neurons can either stimulate or\ninhibit their neighbours and the power of the\ncomputer-mind lies in the strength of these\nconnections.\n'Perceptrons' use such circuitry to recognise\nobjects. These machines are able to read handwriting,\nan impressive task when one thinks of the infinite\nvariety of ways in which people write individual\nletters.\nOne feature of intelligence is the ability to learn from\nmistakes. How can a machine learn? The answer may\nlie in 'Backward Error Propagation'; comparing the\nresults with the original information and a just ing the\nconnections accordingly.\nIt would appear that Artificial Intelligence is, at last,\nheading in the right direction. The researchers are now\nable to model the complex visual systems, so surely\na complete model cannot be far behind?\nUnfortunately there is one major difference between\nthe computer-based and human brains: the brain has\nno Backward Error Propagation. Once again we may\nfind ourselves hitting the limitations of the system\nbefore coming close to a full model. Cynics would\nagree with the Al pioneer John von Neumann that\n'There will be no more simpler model of the Brain than\nthe Brain itself.\nJason Housecroft\nNO OOVl'T VJORM,\nIT DOtSH'T HURT i \u2022 'Mad Cow' disease has been shown to spread to\nlaboratory mice through eating brain tissue from an\ninfected cow. This has increased fears that humans\nmay be able to contract a form of this disease, bovine\nspongiform encephalopathy (BSE), from consumption\nof infected beef produce. BSE is a disease which\ngradually destroys the cow's nervous system. Recent\nresearch has concentrated on feeding the mice with\nbrain tissue, but further work is being performed with\nspleen and spinal cord material to see if these too\ncarry the infection.\n\u2022 Debris in space has been recognised as a serious\nproblem. Abandoned satellites coupled with parts of\nspent rockets now pose a significant threat to the\nsuccess of future space operations. The world's seven\nspace agencies have so far failed to agree any policy\non space litter\nNASA uses almost all of its debris clearing budget\non the region of Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The European\nSpace Agency (ESA) has a budget of just 10 per cent\nof this, but has a programme for Geostationary Orbit\n(GEO) as well as LEO clearing. A Geostationary orbit\nis a path on which a satellite will rotate at the same\nspeed as the Earth, thus holding a constant position\nabove the Earth's surface.\nIt is estimated that there is now in excess of three\nthousand tonnes of space junk orbiting the Earth with\nthe majority of it made up of particles less than 1cm across.\nClearly the 'Star Wars' Defense Initiative tests could\ncontribute significantly to this though the Americans\nhave now decided to operate at low altitudes where\nmost of the fragments from tests will rapidly fall to\nearth.\n\u2022 Robots may be able to operate on humans within\nten years. A surgical robot is being designed at IC for\nprostrate surgery. The predicted time taken for a robot\nto perform this operation is about five minutes as\nopposed to the hour usually required for a surgeon.\nThe law as it stands does not allow a robot to carry\nout such tasks. Present experimental robots in some\nrespects are not yet sophisticated enough; if they\nwere to develop a software fault possible twitching\ncould have potentially disastrous results. Fail-safe\nsoftware, however, is not implausible.\n\u2022 Letter\nDear Sir,\nI was fascinated by your report in last week's FELIX\nof a prototype electromagnetic tank gun capable of\npropelling a3 mm ball 'at a speed of 4.2km h~1'.I estimate I can do about five times better than this\nwith a pea shooter. Any offers?\nYours faithfully,\nBrian Barker.\nReply\nOops; it was a late night! Of course the projectile was\nfired at 4.2kms~'. "

It was late September and it\nseemed to me that the autumnal trees in the garden\nwere singing Mozart. This was my most glorious\nmoment, short-lived though it was.\nAs I saw my parents' car pull away, I was gripped\nby a terrible sense of loss. 'There goes my childhood,'\nI thought in a moment of high melodrama as the car\nturned the corner. Now. that I was no longer a child\nI reined back my tears, swallowed the lump in my\nthroat and went downstairs to the bar to try and pick\nup some women.\nThose of you who know Imperial College, or for that\nmatter any predominantly male institution, will know\nwhat my first great disappointment at University was.\nMy second disappointment? It was not so much a disappointment but more of a shock. Well, to tell you\nthe truth, it was a trauma from which I don't think\nI 'll ever recover. In my first term at College I witnessed\na mass murder.\nIt was truly horrible. Without exception the\nmurderers, for there were more than one, were all\ngnarled old men. I can't remember exactly when or\nwhere it happened but I saw them murder at least a hundred young men and women. Their destruction\nwas slow and deliberate. They extracted as much pain\nfrom these poor wretches as they could without\nactually taking their lives. You see, these men did not\ntake their victims' lives, they did something much\nworse. They took their reason for living.\nThe gnarled old men hated the sight of these young\npeople with Mozart in their ears. To them they were\njust so much meat whose rotten odour they would\ntolerate to justify their fat research cheques.\nTo be fair, there were some who tried to convey\ntheir passion for Physics. But even those who were\nnot on some 'leading the lost tribes into the promised\nland' trip were of little more help than the friendly cop\nin the American TV shows who comforts and builds\nup the suspect before his partner comes along and\npunches them in the kidneys.\nI came with high expectations to learn of a Universe\nof intricate symmetry and beauty, and instead tenth-rate physicists sold me their cynical 'Truths'. Tears\nran down my cheeks as I watched them tear the heart\nout of the subject I loved. One of the greatest\nmasterpieces of Science (or Art for that matter) is the\nencapsulation of the unity of electric and magnetic\nphenomena in the equations of James Maxwell. I had\ntwo courses on the development of this wonderful\nand crucial period in the foundation of a new Physics\nthat would show Newton as the parochial little despot\nthat he was.\nThe courses should have been symphonies, yet we\nwere subjected to confused derivations,\nin com pre hen is ble diagrams, a minutia of meaningless\nand unimportant detail, and all in an incomprehensible\nGlaswegian accent.\nBeing a thick ie,I was warned off the advanced\nquantum mechanics and relativity courses. I should\nfeel angry now that I realise what they did, but my\nmore clever friends tell me that both courses were as\nenlightening as a mouthful of dust.\nI could go on taking individual examples but really\nit was a case of some of Britain's best researchers\nturning beauty, elegance and simplicity into something\nas confused and ugly as themselves.
