Although we have had representation on the Board\nfor about 18 months, this will be our first submission. We feel that this is the major subject of Academic concern for the College's future. We shall also be using our representation and in many cases, unless we use it and use it well, we may as well not have it. The paper has been submitted (a) to review ICU policy on diversification s(b) to gain support for these principles on a College Academic Policy; c(e) to\nstrengthen our quin que n ni al proposals and gain the Board's support for a specific proposal, i.e. that the Academic Director be appointed to take up the position prior to the start of the next quin q en niu m.

There would be provision for those who on 'cons sc en ce' grounds objected to b; ing rec ber a of the v ni on to resign, but this would not deprive thee of the access to facilities provided for the general stu ed nt body.\n( ii) No union subscription would be included in the fees payable by local authorities and individuals.( iii) To encourage authorities in colleges and universities to measure the claims for student union facilities against other claims on their resources, the institution would be responsible for provide ing and maintaining union facilities from its general funds,, The institution would decide according to local circumstances the\nextent to which it provided the facilities itself, or handed money over to the students' union for it to provide them\u201e The use of any such fund a banded over to the\nunion would be accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General or the District Auditor,( iv) To meet the problem Sshat under the present syst it?, student unions sometimes\nspend funds derived fro;, compulsory subscriptions on purposes which would more\nappropriately be supported by the voluntary subscription of in d vi dual students, the\netude nt maintenance grant would be increased by a modest sum to enable students to\njoin particular clubs and societies. At present ties:- are financed by the union; under the new system they would charge a seperate subscription and students\ncould pay aim., join, or not, on an entirely voluntary basis,,\nPerhaps paragraph 14 should also be noted; \"No legislation would be necessary\" (to\nbring about these changes) \u00ab\nI. C.Ui is( obviously) anything but happy about these proposals, and will be holding an\nextraordinary general meeting, which all students are urged to attend, on Monday, 8th November, at 12.45 in the Great Kali.

(Venus\nTheatre, Kentish Town).\nThis is Felix Greene's third\nfilm, his two previous films\n'China' and 'Inside North\nVietnam' both received\ngreat critical acclaim (I did\nnot see either film): 'Cuba\nVa!' was also quite good.\nIt was light hearted showing the Cuban people\ntwelve years after the\nrevolution and despite the\nlack of consumer goods,\nthe political mistakes, the\ndecline in revolutionary\nenthusiasm and the failure\nto reach the hoped for\nsugar harvest of ten million tons as still remaining\noptimistic. This was the\nimpression I obtained from\nthe film that even though\ntheir material wealth is not\ngreat the national spirit is\nvery high. The only detriment to this film is very\npoor quality soundtrack\nwhich produced a wide\nvariety of crackles to spoil\nthe enjoyment of this film.\n\"The past is a foreign\ncountry. They do things difF ilm s mmm\nfe rent ly there.\" So opens\nTHE GO-BETWEEN, Joseph Losey's latest film.\nWith the screenplay by\nHarold Pinter from L.P. Hartley's novel. The film\nshows the timelessness of\nthe Edwardian era with the\nveneer of propriety and beneath the veneer, the illicit\nsci ou sly allowed Ted Burgess to assault the very\nfoundations of the Upper\nClasses. The film is excel-lent: the timelessness is\nshown in the slow, graceful\ncamera work. The dialogue\nhas been cut to just a series of polite phrases\nand understatements and\nwith the absence of any\nsexually explicit scenes or\nstatement Losey intimates\nwhat is happening by the\nslightest physical move-ment. Overall a film well\nworth seeing. Also you\nmight be lucky enough to\nsee all the documentary, I only saw the last half. It\nwas BALEIA, BALEIA\n(which is Portuguese for\nwhales) and is a documentary about whale hunting from small boats and\nthe climax shows a whale\nbeing hunted and killed\nwhich was very well edit-ed, combining the right\namount of excitement and\ntenseness.\nThe films aren't quite\nthe films I said I'd be re-viewing, but I hope to re-view, at least 'Private\nRoad' in the next edition.\nlove affair between Marian\n(Julie Christie) and Ted\nBurgess (Alan Bates) and\nhow the outcome of this\naffair harms Leo (Dominic\nGuard), a twelve-year-old\nguest in the house; the outsider who by acting as the\npostman between Marion\nand Ted Burgess unc on Curved Air\nYou will recall that Curved Air are the group with\ntwo classically trained musicians and a singer who used\nto be in \"Hair\" (Nudge Nudge) who came on to the\nscene in the coolest possible way, man\u2014they were\nadopted as a \"nice band\" by John Peel. They brought\nout an album with pretty patterns on it and in spite of\nthe howls of \"hype!\" rose to prominence as one of the\nmore interesting of the new electronic groups.\nBut times change. When Curved Air played at the\nCollege something was missing from the Curved Air\nof a year ago. The musical skills are still there of course,\nparticularly Francis Monkman's flowing keyboard work.\nIt has been severely brought home to me in the last\nthree weeks that there is more to playing the VCS3\nSynthesizer than making freaky noises and Monkman\nseems to have avoided this. During his most recent opus\n\"Piece of Mind\" and also \"What Happens When You\nBlow Yourself Up?\" he played some nice passages on\nthe synthesizer but I was constantly reminded of other\nmusicians, particularly Keith Emerson and, yes you've\nguessed it, Terry Riley, and I think this is where the\ngroup falls down \u2014 their new material doesn't have\nthat indelible \"Curved Air\" stamp on it that the first\nalbum had, and old standards like \"Vivaldi\" and \"Pro-positions\" are wearing a bit thin now. The only new\nnumber I really like was \"Everdance\" featuring Darryl\nWay's screaming violin and Monkman's organ (whoops)\ncompeting for space, which set ever dancing the audience which for most of the act had been behaving in\nan extremely por rid gy fashion. But as soon as Sonja\nKristina said \"Come on, get up\" the audience rose as\none. Because of this I doubt if the \"enthusiastic\" reception was a true reflection of the audience'sap pre cia tion, rather the audience entertaining itself. But I could\nbe completely wrong.\nAir were preceded by Curtiss Maldoon who played a not particularly memorable set although their stage chat\nwas amusing and they gained a polite reception.\nFootnote: We regret the absence of a photograph, but\nour photographer was not allowed into this concert\u2014Ed.\nDebatable\nThe debating society\npicked a winner when it\nchose the motion 'This\nhouse condemns interference in Pakistan's internal\naffairs'. Mech Eng 542\n(Deb Socs regular abode)\nwas pleasantly packed with\na strong contingent of students with a personal concern for the area involved.\nMr. Ahmed proposing\nthe motion based his case\non the assumption that the\narmed intervention in\nBangla Desh was merely\nan internal matter; the rest\nof the world and Britain in\nparticular had no more\nright to interfere, than\nPakistan had in Northern\nIreland. Also that the\nworld's concern should be\nsolely with the refugees in\nIndia.\nOpposing the motion\nMr. Bruce Douglas Mann\nM.P. described his very\nemotional experiences\nwhilst visiting the area and\nInter - Action Community\nArts Co-operative needs\nmature people to work as\nvolunteers during the\nChristmas, Easter and\nSummer vacations.

He believed that history would reveal the atrocities inflicted by the military had surpassed even\nthe Nazi's efforts towards\nthe Jews. Later in an eloquent and impassioned\nspeech by an unknown\nperson, the same armies'\nactions were described as\ndastardly, cowardly and\nbloodthirsty. He also suggested that Yahya Khan's form of democracy was\nthat if a majority opposed\nhis will he would physically\nreduce the majority to a minority. On the other hand\nMr. Ahmed claimed it was\nimpossible for the army to\ncommit genocide. This was\nmet with sorry shouts of\n\"they're having a bloody\ngood try\".\nThe general opinion was\nfar from one sided. One\nsupporter of the motion\nstated that India far from\nbeing an innocent bystander had conspired\nwith Shaik Mujib Rahman\nfor the complete autonomy\nof E. Pakistan. Another\ncontested Mr. Mann's evidence on the grounds that\nit was obtained via an\nIndian interpreter and\nhence liable to distortion.\nThe result, after a noisy\nsumming up requiring a little table bashing by the\nchairman was that the motion was defeated by 42\nvotes to 19 with 6 abs.

What queues\nIF IE lb D( reviews the local' Eats' The Department of Higher Education\nallows an undergraduate student precisely \u00a3465 to live on during his 31 week\nacademic year. Just two meals in one\nweek at any of the restaurants reviewed\nwould leave the student broke.\nLiving away from home may be a novelty at first but eventually a large\nproportion of people, and I think I am\none, become bored with their independence in fact their very existence. Life\nat university is a survival process, survival of the mind rather than the body.\nFOOD is for the Body, eating is for the\nmind.\nTo site a university in South Kensington is a particularly cruel piece of Government even if it was determined before the working classes reached out to\ngrasp higher education with the introduction of compulsory L.E.A. grants. In\nthe majority students are financial\nequals and to that end eating in South\nKensington if not chosen carefully can\nbecome expensive.\nThere are numerous publications telling you where to find cheap food, cook\ncheap meals, and drink cheap beers and\nit is pointless for me to examine them\nagain. However what I set out to do\nwhen investigating for this article was\nto give ideas of where to eat occasionally for enjoyment and entertainment all\nwithin the student campus.\nThe Fulham Road at the present time\nseems an extremely pleasant place to\neat (or live). Closest to College is Parsons, a simple mixture of Victorian drawing room charm and American free rock.\nParsons was liberated early in the summer and you now find yourself talking\nquite easily to the male waiters and female manager ess and it is typical of the\nnew style restaurants that there are no\nInside the 'Pizza Resistance'\nproblems about what to wear or how to\naddress the staff. Be casual, be relaxed,\nassume a designed scruff in ess \u2014it's expected of you! Decoration doesn't exist.\nThe walls are plain, insipid cream in\ncolour adorned only with a few badly\nplaced full length mirrors which show\nembarrassing profiles of customers syphoning spaghetti. The floor is wood\u2014\nun carpeted \u2014and the tables and chairs\nhard and round; not an honest atmosphere, but certainly fine for escaping.\nI have only ever eaten the spaghetti\nthere, but then there are five choices.\nTraditional is my own favourite with a green salad, blue cheese, mayonnaise\nand hot garlic bread\u201460p and seconds\nare free if you ask for them. Mrs. Parsons Vegetarian Delight is absolutely\nenormous and is guaranteed to prevent\nthe nasty scurvy of students from\nrelapsing.\nJust 25 yards along the road is the\nGreat American Disaster\u2014a gaudy,\nnoisy place which probably does little\nto belie the name. I didn't like it\u2014but\nthen hamburgers are boring anyway.\nPossibly their greatest claim to fame\nis their fresh unlimited coffee.\nIt's always worth taking in the Iced\nDream (distinguished by the fibre-glass\nice cream gnome\u2014courtesy of 'Ink')\neven if it is only for the singular attention you receive. Avoid the peanut\ncrunch\u2014it isn't \u2014but do try the rum and\nbutter\u2014it is. Prices start at 18p to 48p for a knickerbocker glory. Going further\ndown the Fulham Road is the Plastic\nPizza Palace (Pizza Express). Pizza obviously seem to be the in thing to eat in\nthis area with both old and new eating\nhouses selling them. There is no doubt\nthat the pizza must be one of the most\nover-rated foods around\u2014easy to prepare\u2014most pizzas come ready-made\nfrom Marchi-Zellar and just require topping off to finish\u2014no skill in cooking\u2014\njust straight into a microwave.\nAesthetic enjoyment and financial\nbankruptcy do not necessarily go hand\nin hand. Simple food more often seems\nto give me personal pleasure. The Hot\nPot in the basement of the Mardis Court\nHotel, Hogarth Road serves excellent\nfood at rock-bottom prices. The atmosphere is certainly friendly (as well as\nhot) and it's so dark it is often difficult\nto see what you are eating. The Minestrone soup (which at 5p simply cannot\nbe beat), rich, thick and full of everything else on the menu is the only way\nto start although the corn on the cob at\n13p is rumoured excellent. Main courses\nare both well cooked and large portions.\nTry the Moussaka at 23p for something\ndifferent. This is another restaurant that\nserves excellent salads with mayonnaise\nthat is out of this world. It's one restaurant that really is worth tipping as the\nfood is good value. Service good and\nfriendly. In the same road are the Pot\nand Golden Pot\u2014both poor imitations\nof the actual Hotpot.\nIn the same price range but better\nsurroundings are the Stockpot, (Stig-pig), Basil Street, at the rear of Harrods\nand the Chelsea Kitchen on the Kings\nRoad. One of the pleasures of eating at\nthe Stockpot is the proliferation of attractive French waitresses\u2014but watch\nout for the greasy eunuch! Prices are\nhigher than the Hotpot but the menu is\nvirtually identical\u2014small spaghetti followed by large spaghetti for that sinking feeling.\nI can think of nothing pleasant to\nsay about the Chelsea Kitchen\u2014the food\nmight be OK but the atmosphere is\nfrigid, the waitresses uncompromising\nand the customers typical of the insincerity of the whole Kings Road.\nGloucester Road is blanketed with\ncafes and restaurants: for the most part\nthey are reasonable, but try them for\nyourself or note the comments in the\nUSK handbook. It's worth going into\nFrank's Sandwich Bar (next to the sta-tion) which not only sells excellent sandwiches but good pasta, and at reasonable prices. The attraction of the place\nis the variety of people, from rich to\npoor, that you tend to find. Frank (tall,\nbald, Italian?) is the guy who guards the\ntill in the corner. A complete contrast\nis Pizzaland across the road\u2014possibly\nthe best crispy pizza in South Kensington.\nStaying with pizzas it is worth moving\nnearer to College and the Pizza Resistance. Recently opened, it is worth con-side ring, housed in the old Kensington\nand Chelsea Post Office. The painted\norange brick walls are reminiscent of\nsome of the more avant-garde student\nhouses.\nThe kitchens are at street level and the\nla bar in thy i um restaurant below it. I have\nseen the cartoons on the walls somewhere before but can't remember where\n\u2014they don't really add anything to the\natmosphere except perhaps confuse the\nhacksaw ed edge carpet and Tamla\nbackground sound.\nWe tried the Quattro Stagioni and\nweren't disappointed. It was an interesting blend of Artichoke, mushrooms, ham,\nolives, anchovy and moz are lla, the\nresulting taste was not as confused as it\nmay at first seem with the herbs coming\nout pretty distinctively. Coffee was some\nof the best we had tried with a large cup\nof hot fresh real coffee complete with a jug of cream for 7p. In a way most of the restaurants reviewed so far seem to have an Italian\nbasis\u2014probably due to the involvement\nof the Continent with eating away from\nhome\u2014it is a style which has been copied by most distinctive eating houses as\nthey generally serve French cuisine.\nHowever, the other export leader (the\nAmericans) on the food market has not\nbeen forgotten, their best example being\nthe Shangri-La Chinese Restaurant in\nthe Old Brompton Road.\nSomeone once said that AmericanChinese restaurants were a communist\nplot to destroy them as everyone who\nate in a Chinese restaurant ate until\nthey were satisfied but 2 hours later\nthey were hungry again, consequently\nthe whole of the U.S. would starve to\ndeath.\nThe cheaper upstairs area is designed\nfor midgets with voyeuristic tendencies,\nstill not very cheap but the good is gen-really good quality. Waitresses vary from\nglamour ones to real-life blue marines.\nIt's worth taking one of the window seats\njust to look at the truncated bodies of\nthe passers-by through the divided win-dow. Easily one of the best dishes there\nis Subgum Noodles with gravy. I haven't yet discovered what they are but they\nseem a cross between pork, shrimps and\nscallops.\nIn order to produce this article thanks\ngo to the Pizza Resistance for sus ten ance, Fiat for transport, Eros for relief\nand Harpenden for inspiration.\nIf nausea should nudge your mind,\nThen think, are you the honking kind?\nIf you are then don't dwell on it\u2014\nPurge it with a healthy vomit.\nIMPOSSIBLE ?\n. . . . not if you buy your drawing instruments from the\" l.C.

    "content": "WARMING STUDENT UNIONS IN DANGER Your college student union is a self-governing community. Mrs.\nThatcher is considering measures which could make it impossible\nfor you to elect proper representatives and control your union's affairs. Administration of your sports clubs, societies, bar,\nnewspaper and premises would be affected, as well as your\nparticipation in college affairs. This initiative has arisen because\nlocal authorities want to limit and safeguard the spending of\npublic money and some Conservative politicians do not like\nstudent unions. These are the issues involved.\nShould the union fee be compulsory?\nThe individual is required to pay a fee towards the cost of union\nfacilities whether he uses them extensively or not. Some suggest\nthat this is an unwarranted compulsion. NUS argues\n1 In any complex establishment, members pay for basic facilities\nthey do not necessarily use. The student through his academic\nfees may contribute to the cost of the library but not use it.\nCommon sense dictates that he cannot claim a rebate\n2 The element of compulsion is far outweighed by the benefit of\nthe facilities to the individual\n3 If payment of fees were optional then the union would\neffectively become a private members club. Elaborate checks\nwould be necessary to exclude non-members from the\nfacilities\u2014including sometimes the principal canteen facilities.\nIncome would vary un predictably, year by year. Financial\nplanning would be impossible. No security of tenure could be\noffered to union staff. The future existence of the union could\nnot be predicted\n4 If the college authorities provided the facilities they would\nundoubtedly do so by charging a fee so that the element of\ncompulsion would remain, but the control by the student body\nwould be lost\nShould membership of the Union be compulsory?\nIt has been suggested on the analogy of the trade union closed\nshop that the student's automatic membership of his union is a limitation of his freedom, and that membership should be\nvoluntary. NUS argues\n1 Voluntary membership would destroy the union as a representative body. Only a100% franchise can make it\npossible for students to elect representatives\n2 Students need to express and defend their interests corporate ly. They form an important section of any college community and\nhave definable interests in relation to the college\u2014and indeed\nto the State\n3 Students would not be allowed to participate in college affairs\nwithout the election of proper representatives. The Privy\nCouncil has required Universities to ensure that student\nrepresentatives were fully representative before admitting\nthem to College Committees\n4 Unlike a closed shop, student unions have no tight\ndisciplinary structure by which members may be penal is ed for\nbreach of rule, for instance, for failing to observe union policy\nto strike. Almost the only rules laid down by a students union\nenforceable upon ordinary student members relate to the\nregulation of facilities and financial procedures\n5 Voluntary membership would shatter the college as a community. An inherent divisiveness would be generated by\nthe presence of individuals who were willing, or at least did\nnot object to receiving a great many benefits from the\nexistence of the student unions, from better facilities and\nprocedures, to grant increases\u2014whilst refusing to meet the\ninconsiderable burden of association with that student\norganisation. More violent, unpredictable and chaotic clashes\ncould be expected to occur between some sections of the\nstudent body and authorities if the government made it\nimpossible for acceptable representatives to be elected\nShould a Registrar of Student Unions be appointed?\nThe Parliamentary Select Committee report on Student Relations\nsuggested the appointment of a Registrar of Student Unions to\nprotect public money by approving student unions'constitution\nand accounts. NUS argues\n1 A Registrar in unnecessary. Three mechanisms already exist\nto protect public money.\ni Union constitutions must be approved by the college\ngoverning body\nii Any individual can take a union to court for acting\nun constitutionally iii Student union accounts must be audited and presented to\nan Annual General Meeting of the Union\n2 The Registrar's powers would be so wide-ranging that union\nself government could be changed or destroyed at any time in\nthe future\nWhy the fuss?\nThe rare and vigorously publicised decisions of two unions out of\n700 to withhold recognition from a right wing political society has\nled to the demand that all unions should be deprived of, or have\ncurtailed their power of sponsorship. The sponsorship involves\nrecognising athletic, religious, political and departmental\nsocieties, checking their bona fide s, rules and accounts, making a money grant towards their activities, and providing facilities.\nNUS argues\n1 Political discrimination is deplored by the student body at\nleast as much as by its critics. NUS Conference on April 1971\noverwhelmingly agreed, \"Conference thus approves the\nprinciple of academic freedom, namely that the expression of\nany particular opinion, no matter how unorthodox,\ndistasteful or unpopular should not be inhibited by physical or\nmental intimidation or in any other way\"\n2 The tiny number of unions that our critics, despite their\ndiligent searches have found to deviate from this principle\nindicates its wide acceptance and practice by the student body\n3 Persuasion by the student body has already caused one of the\ntwo unions referred to above, to reverse its decision, and\nrecognise the political society\n4 Crude legislative devices against discrimination would in these\ncircumstances be neither necessary nor particularly effective.\nWe believe it is best left to the pressure the student body\nbrings to bear\nWhat to do\nThe Government has said it wants consultation and agreement\nwith the NUS. We await their proposals. Meanwhile it is imperative\nthat you\n1 Write to the M.P. of your college constituency. Your union\npresident will advise on content\n2 Ask your parents to write to their M.P. explaining the value of\nthe student union to college life.\n\n"

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX Thursday, November 4, 1971\nFIGHTING FOR\nMINORITY RIGHTS\nBen Whitaker, the former Labour MP for Hampstead\nand Junior Minister at the Ministry of Overseas Development and now Director of the Minority Rights Group,\ntalks to Jim Talbot.\n\"If you look at the UN Charter, you'll find that it begins\n'We the peoples of the World'. In practice, though, it's come to mean 'We the Governments'. Until that contradiction is resolved the Minority Rights Group will have\na job to do\".\nBen Whitaker took over as Director of the MRG after\nthe retirement of Laurence Gandar, the former Editorin-chief of the Rand Daily Mail. The brainchild of Observer Editor David Astor, the Group was formed in 1970\nas an independent, non-Governmental research and\ninformation unit to publicise the ill-treatment of ethnic,\nreligious and cultural minorities throughout the world.\nSponsors of the Group include Lady Butler, Milovan\nDjilas, Gunnar Myrdal and Joseph Needham. Jo Grimond\nis Chairman of the Group's Council.\n\"Basically we do for minority groups what Amnesty\ndoes for individuals\", Ben Whitaker explained, \"and,\nlike Amnesty, we try to put ourselves above political\nbias. Since we are an international body we mustn't even hesitate to criticise this country. We've already\ndone this to some extent in Harold Jackson's Report\non Ireland, and Gratton Puxon's survey of the Gypsies\nin Europe will probably annoy people here as well\".\nInternational Reports\nAlready the Minority Rights Group has published four\nReports \u2014 on the East African Asians, Religious Minorities in the Soviet Union, the Burakumin in Japan and on\ngroup tensions in Ireland \u2014 and future topics for study\ninclude the Spanish Americans in the US, the Indians\nin Latin America, the Basques, the Untouchables in\nIndia, the Chinese in Indonesia and the European\nGypsies.\n\"Besides well-publicised minorities like the East African Asians we also try to cover groups of people whom\nthe general public tends to hear much less about\", he\nemphasised. \"We have already published Professor\nGeorge DeVos's Report on the two million Burakumin\nin Japan, outcasts who are segregated in urban and\nrural ghettoes. And we have deliberately chosen to focus\nour attention on the Spanish Americans in the US rather\nthan the negros. Few people are even aware of the way\nin which gypsies have been treated in Europe for many\nyear now\u2014some 600,000 were systematically executed\nby the Nazis, for example.\"\nReports are researched and written for the Group by\nindependent authorities on the subject, usually academics or journalists. The Report on Ireland was by\nGuardian reporter Harold Jackson. \"Since he'd had a rib cracked by rioters, had been b atoned by the police,\ngassed by the British Army and considered himself an\nagnostic, he could fairly claim to be neutral in his\napproach to the situation ! \"\nUlster\nHarold Jackson's report was concerned with the Protestant minority in the Republic as well as the more\ntopical discrimination practised against the Catholics of\nUlster. Of the former he concluded: \"There are few insuperable problems for the Protestants in the Republic\nbecause they form only a twentieth of the whole and\nbecause their general standard of wealth and social\nposition is unusually advanced.\" But he was less optimistic in his hopes for the larger Catholic minorities in the\nNorth, living in the ghettoes of the Shankill and Falls\narea of Belfast or the Bogside and Fountain districts of\nLondonderry. Disorders, he said, are endemic in the\nsociety. Long-overdue reforms, no matter at what rate\nthey could be brought in, would never come fast enough\nfor the deprived minority and would at the same time\npresent a growing and unacceptable threat to the privileged. Improvement, he concluded, would only come\nwith a more open-handed programme of economic development and with the growth of inter-communal co-operation. But both solutions, he was forced to admit,\nwould take time.\nDespite its balanced analysis and careful argument,\nfew recommendations for immediate action to find a solution emerged from Harold Jackson's Report. Ben\nWhitaker agreed : \"In a sense, Amnesty has an easier\ntask since people can identify much more with an individual prisoner. It's also so much easier for a Government to release one man from captivity than to do something about the sufferings of an under-privileged minor-it y. And our resources are very small.\"\nIn contrast to Amnesty's well-publicised postcard cam-pa ign s, the Minority Rights Group feels that it can be\nmore effective in educating public opinion by circulating\nits Reports to newspapers throughout the world. Coverage in the Observer, Guardian and the New York Times\nhas been good but the Group are less sure about the\nforeign language press since it's so much more difficult\nto get hold of cuttings. Reports are also sent to experts\nwith opposing views on the subject and to the Governments concerned. In fact President Kaunda himself\nasked for copies of the Report on the East African\nAsians and a dozen copies of Harold Jackson's Report\nwent to Dublin and to Stormont.\nEducational Charity\nMore direct campaigning is precluded by the Group's status as an Educational Charity. \"There is a very narrow borderline between the educational function we are\nallowed to perform and direct political lobbying for\nchanges in the law\", he explained. \"Organisations like\nShelter and Oxfam suffer from this too. Most of our\nmoney comes from Trusts like the Ford Foundation and\nif we were to lose our charitable status they'd no longer\nbe able to give us anything at all. So we feel that the\nbest way to go about things is to act as the leaven in\nthe bread and to let public opinion do the rest.\"\nBut what about totalitarian states where the Minority\nRights Group is denied access to public opinion? \"The\nsituation is worst where there is no free press\", he\nagreed, \"and this even includes Singapore now. But Lee\nKuan Yew is at least approachable. And most totalitarian\nstates are more responsive to outside public pressure\nthan we often realise, especially when they're trying to\npromote tourism\".\nWill the Group's research have any predictive value,\nabout the type of society most likely to be able to integrate a minority successfully, for example? \"It's really\ntoo soon to tell\", he answered. \"But at the moment\nalmost every Government has some kind of skeleton in\nits cupboard. We all tend to need a scapegoat, to draw\nattention away from the less pleasant aspects of our-selves\".\n\"Ideally\", he continued, \"we should have a UN Commissioner for Human Rights. But since all Governments\nrepresent majorities, very few of them would like to see\neffective machinery set up to help minorities\".\nWhere we come in . . .\nFinally, is there any way in which students can help\nthe Minority Rights Group? \"Unlike Amnesty, we have\nno formal membership\", he replied. \"The help we need\nis in selling our Reports \u2014 a group of students at\nOxford is doing that now in fact. We'd also like to hear\nfrom people who'd be willing to do research work for us\nin their vacations, either here in London or on their\ntrips abroad. But I'm afraid that we can't afford to pay\nanyone ! \"\nThe Minority Rights Group is based at Benjamin\nFranklin House, 36 Craven Street, London, W.C.2. C0LCUTT\nA watery sun rises over the glass-bound complex that\nis Imperial College. Pallid students, eyes sleep-gummed,\nstagger zombie fashion to first lectures. Right hands\ntwitch spastic ally over virgin foolscap. Words, symbols\nform on paper \u2014 soon to be forgotten. A leaden boredom hangs over the College.\nIn Mech.

His\ninability to handle the English language masked only by\nhis stutter and Glaswegian accent, the ancient professor\nturns to inscribe further ille gibi li ties on the blackboard.\nEyes glaze over in the back row. A solitary paper dart\nhangs motionless in a shaft of light. ZZWOK I! An eight\nfoot as sega i hurtles from the back of the room and\nburies itself, quivering, in the blackboard \u2014 inches\nfrom the professor's outstretched hand. The chalk fails\nfrom his nerveless fingers. There is a tiny moment of\ncalm. HOWL, ROAR, STAMP \u2014 it is gone forever as a wave of Zulu warriors in full regalia sweep down the\nsteps, force Professor Crutch to remove his trousers,\nand declaim Tennyson's 'Morte D 'Arthur' whilst standing on one leg, in a bucket of Mooney's Brown Sauce.\nThe day is at hand. The revolution dawn eth. A laugh-ing, joking, singing revolution. The one thing I.C. can\nneither stand nor understand. D.H.

To uninitiated first-year Arnold Retch it looks more like a collection of\nmisshapen drain pipes and an old rusty dustbin \u2014 but\nhe is Vomit Champion of the Rugby Club, and bound\nfor higher things RURK!

    "content": "SCHOOL KIDS9 ISSUE IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION 4th NOVEMBER 1971 No. 304\nVISION OF FU TU 'Stoic* Presents\nFirst Programme\nS.T.O.I.C. in case you didn't know, is the Student\nTelevision of Imperial College and in a masterly demonstration of co-ordination and skill on behalf of the staff\nof Felix we are publishing this article just as the club\nis about to show its first regularly produced programme.\nHowever, before I go into details about this I plan\nto tell you all about the\nclub. (There are reasons\nfor this, none of which I'm going to disclose, so\nthere!) This was set up in\n1969 by Electrical Engineering, who found they\nhad a lot of (very) expensive equipment with no\none to use it. All these bits\nand pieces had been\nbought originally in connection with the public\nspeaking classes which\nare part of the Associated\nStudies (or is it General\nStudies?) courses. Every\nstudent in the department\nhas to do various talks in\neach year, these counting\ntowards the final degree.\n(These are now recorded\nby S.T.O.I.C. members\nmainly on Wednesday afternoons and so the quality is considerably improv-ed.) All in all a remarkably good idea, considering how important it is to\nbe able to communicate\nideas in a coherent man-ner.\nThe club therefore owns\npractically none of the\nhardware that it uses and\nthis is the point that I was\ntold to be quite explicit\non, as it appears the department is very touchy\nabout the subject. Apparently 'they' object to seeing articles published\nwhere the authors condescendingly mentions that\nS.T.O.I.C. have a studio\nwhich, they occasionally\nlet the Elec. Eng. use. In\nfact it is the other way\nround! This dependence\non the goodwill (or rather\nlack of actual bad will, and\nthere is a difference) of\nthe department puts the\nclub in a particularly vulnerable position as it has\nalways to be nice to every-one. What would happen,\nsay, if it televised a discussion of which the Department disapproved? (I have\nchanged to a capital letter\nas it now seems appropriate.) In fact Felix itself\nis bowing to internal pressure in not discussing the\ncase of the 'there but\nnot theirs' piece of complex electronics and precious engineering which is\nslowly collecting dust in\nthe T.V. studio. One of\nthree cameras with full\nsound and vision mixing\nfacilities, numerous small\nand large monitors scattered about the place, and,\na video tape recorder,\nthe club owns only one 25\ninch screen monitor,\nbought for them by the\nUnion.\nThis cost \u00a3100, which\nis odd in itself as a proper\ntelevision containing about\ntwice the electronics costs\nonly \u00a360. I believe it also\nowns two video tapes. This\nappears to be of little consequence until one considers that they cost about\n\u00a330 each! You may have\ngot the impression that\nS.T.O.I.C. is entirely run by\nElec. Eng., but it is in fact\nconnected with R.C. C. in\nexactly the same way as\nall other I.C. societies.\nThis explains the fact that\nyou have to pay a subscription which at first\nsight might seem unnecessary. cont'd on p.8 SOUTHSIDE SHOP\nThe South Side Shop is\nin future to open at 9 a.m. so that people can buy provisions (before rather than\nduring) first lectures. Also\nthere is to be Saturday\nmorning opening.\nLunchtime O 'Bacteria\nLAW UNTO THEMSELVES\nThe Union is distinctly\npeeved at the way Ents is\nby-passing normal requirements for approval of major policy changes. Ents,\nwho regularly make big\nlosses on big name con-cert s, have instituted weekly big-name Saturday con-cert s, and plan to scrap\nhops. Also, in failing to admit a Felix photographer\ninto the recent Curved Air\nconcert, they are breaking\na condition of their Union\ngrant acceptance.\nNews in Brief SHOCKING EXTORTION\nNotes included with invitations to Commemoration Day drew attention to\nthe services of the \"Uni-vers it y Degree Photographer\". The notes unfortunately forgot to mention that the cost of six\nidentical post card size\nprints or one single\nplate print, for instance,\nwas no less than \u00a32. Who\nawarded this lucrative,\nnear monopolistic fran-c his e? Why was no check\nof fair pricing made?\nIN THE MUCK HEAP\nThe habit which local\nNews Residents seem to\nencourage, namely dogs\ndefacing in Princes Gardens, is reaching crisis\npoint. This subject was recently brought up by Linstead Hall committee who\nare annoyed at having to\ndelicately pick their way\nthrough the mire.\nLunchtime O 'Bladder\nSHOCK ALLEGATION\nMr. D. Sugden, in reply\nto allegations that at least\nthree of the three Colcutts\nfeatured in the Freshers'\nIssue, the current and the\nnext issue of Felix are no\nlonger students at Imperial\nCollege, said this was\npure coincidence. It seems\nthat some traditions of secrecy in the identity of the\nwriter of the Colcutt column have been lost.\nAPOLOGIA\nWe apologise to Dave\nLee for implicating him in\nthe recent walk through\nthe plate glass window\nalongside the main door of\nLinstead Hall. The victim\nor culprit, was apparently\nanother Dave. In order to\nprevent further such oc-cur rence s, the sub-warden\nhas arranged to have the\ntables replaced in front of\nthe windows.\nLunchtime O 'Bruises\nNO ORDINARY CARROT\nStudents opening bank\naccounts should give consideration to what the\nbank will charge them\nwhen they are no longer\nstudents. A recent graduate queried this, and discovered to his horror that\nto avoid charges when\nbanking with the Midland\nhe would have to keep his\ncurrent account above\n\u00a3150 in credit on average.\nThis compared badly with\nanother bank approached.\nBe warned.\nSEAFORD BWANA\nThe other night, whilst\nnot so sober, Carl Seaford\ntold Dave Amos that he is\nnot a holder of a British\nPassport. He does, in fact,\nhold a Ghana passport.\nMOONEY CLEAN UP\nFurther to Felix probe\nin the previous issue, Mr.\nMooney is pleased to announce that his kitchens\nwill be professionally\ncleaned by an outside firm.\nLunchtime O 'Beanz\nand Chips\nBAR BID\nThe Union is pressing to\ntake responsibility for the\nbars, and thus prevent the\nnot inconsiderable profits\ngoing to sub sid is e the re-fec tories.

To this enthusiastic bunch of news pur-vey or s, the staff of Felix wish to, as another enthusiastic\nbunch of news purveyors, extend their best wishes for\nthe future. They'll need them!\nImperial College is probably one of the biggest waste\npaper producers in the country and the cunning trick\nused to conceal this fact is the printing on the blasted\nstuff. Broadsheet, Minesheet, Guildsheet, l.C.

Felix in conjunction\nwith S.T.O.I.C. can satisfy all its need. If Felix were\ngiven the money to boost itself up to weekly pro duc tion, S.T.O.I.C. were given the money to boost itself up\nto twice weekly production between the two we would\nhave 'The Newspaper of Imperial College' and 'The T.V. News service of Imperial College', a completely adequate news service, space in our waste paper bins,\nand more money for everybody. Instead, I am sad to\nsay, many of you will have read the first sentence of\nthis paragraph and say the same old nauseating words.\n'What about Felix then?' You now have my answer.\nThe IRA have arrived. The post-office tower has been\nchosen as the first major target in Britain where yet\nanother bomb has been planted. How can anybody\n(N.B.a certain body in this college) have sympathy for\nsuch small mindedness. Is anything worth the ridiculous tragedy that has sprung up in Ireland. If every Irish\nman, woman and child were to be enslaved I doubt if I could accept such stupidity as justified. We are all\naware of what has happened in Ireland over the past\nfew years. The only question that remains is one of\nvalues. What value do you place on the life of a human\nbeing? To my mind this value is infinite and until the\nIRA realise the value of life, no man will be able to\njustify to me any sympathy towards their cause.\nDear Sir,\nThe Queen of Jez competition is typical of the annual\nevents provided by the R.C.S. committee, designed to\nwelcome and inaugurate fresher s into the rituals of\nl.C. life. R.C.S. is proud to have the largest ratio of\nwomen to men of all the constituent colleges; and to\nshow their eagerness to make the women feel at ease\nthey parade as many of the fresher women as they can\nin front of a well attended R.C.S. union meeting.\nThis degrading exhibition not only obstructs the\nnatural integration of women into college society, but\nby accentuating the lack of women helps to initiate\nthe men into the impotent beer-drinking circles which\nare all too common in l.C. The proportion of men to women here is one of I.C's. many unfortunate characteristics which make this college a very difficult place to be at. The encouragement\nof this kind of event can only distract from changing\nthe situation here.\nYours faithfully,\nJill Dare.\n{ Felix, the newspaper of Imperial College is still j{ edited by Dave Sugden, with much assistance from*\n*Tony Upton, Oily Dowson, Dave Gribble, Andrew*\n-tc Melvin, Colette Roberson, Ross McBeath, Bernard^\n{Williams, and Ron Matthews. *\n* *\n* The features are by Tony Sims, and the reviews*\n*are by John Bryan and Stephen Amor.

Business mismanagement by your own JohnJ\n*Stares. $\nLETTERS\nJob Lot?\nDear Sir,\nAlthough this may seem unusual for a person of my\ntrade (more about that later) to be aware of and indeed\nto read your publication, a college newspaper, I feel\nI could perhaps offer some advice to your extremely intelligent and moreover secular circle of readers.\nThe advice concerns future employment. Your readers are, I am sure, aware of the lack of jobs that exist\ntoday. Particularly those where a graduate may apply\nhis knowledge in the same discipline that he was studying at University.\nNow it stems from that, that the obvious mode of obtaining employment is to diversify into a career which\nis more applicable to society at large. Furthermore, the\nonly way to obtain advancement in society is not take\na conventional job, but to find perhaps some industry\nthat is either new and has prospects of large expansion.\n(Consider for instance the case IBM at the beginning\nof the century. Who would have believed that a company selling sophisticated abacuses could have multiplied in size, with the aid of advances in technology, to\nbecome one of the world's largest companies. Why one\npound invested in the company in the 1920's would\nyield 6000 pounds now). Or, to seek out some profession that is extant but neither large or profitable due to\nlack of technical expertise.\nHowever, all this is known and I expect your readers\nhave conducted much research into this problem in\nthe manner that they have been taught. I suspect also\nthat a large proportion have considered my trade as\nindeed I did when If jr st entered it.\nMy profession is that of a collector of Unwanted Consumer Articles, known in short to the public as a 'Rag\nand Bone Man'.\nHow did I decide to make this my profession? Well I, like you, ^worked through the possibilities of employment and finally arrived at the conclusion that this particular trade offered enormous chances for expansion,\nimproved efficiency and high salaries.\nAll this happened twenty years ago, unfortunately in\nmy youthful and somewhat naive approach I failed to\nbe aware of the other technological changes taking\nplace simultaneously in society, which were making\nmy profession, inherently obsolete. Let me give you an\nindication of the present state of the industry to illustrate my point and serve as a guide-line to others.\nWhen I first started in the trade it was possible to\npick up some quite impressive goods from householders who were completely ignorant of their true\nworth. Tables, chairs and sets of china proved to be the\nmost profitable lines. For instance, one could frequently\nobtain chairs which could be sold for about \u00a320 or \u00a330.\nHowever, with the increasing public awareness of the\nvalue of antiques which grew up during the fifties and\nsixties, our profits dipped while our costs have risen.\nAs regards profits, we find that our position as wholesaler has been cut to a minimum and the public are\ngoing direct to antique dealers. Costs, well you may be\nsurprised, but we still have to maintain our image with\nthe public by using the traditional method of transportation, that is to say the horse and cart. The cost of this\nis so high now that most of the members of our profession prefer to hire horses and wagons, but even this can\ncost \u00a37 a week.\nWhat of the traditional rags and bones? You might\nask. Well, rags these days consist mainly of artificial\nfibres which of course are of no use in the pulping in-dust ry. Iron, the traditional call of the Rag and Bone\nman, is virtually non-existent in the modern household.\nMetals of any kind are down to a minimum, largely replaced by plastic which has no scrap value of course.\nRather than go into further details, let me just say that\nI jumped into this situation without consideration of\npossible changes that could take place in society and\nas a result, suffered. Therefore let me take this opportunity to urge your readers to think very carefully\nbefore they decide upon which area of society to devote their energies.\nYours faithfully,\nJohnny Craven.\nBarclays Again\nDear Sir,\nIt has come to my attention that your publication is\nencouraging, nay, exhorting innocent (sic) fresher s to\nplace their money inside the vaults of a certain bank.\nWhile I appreciate that this particular advertisement\nbrings in a substantial amount of revenue which you\ncannot afford to ignore may I suggest that, beside\nevery such ad. be placed a notice to the effect that I personally recommend the reader to bank elsewhere.\nYours, etc.,\nHarry M.

    "content": "Page 8 FELIX Thursday, November 4, 1971\nCommemoration Day\nor how to\nbore2,000 people\nUnion Concert Many of us go right through college\nmaintaining up to the last our determination not to attend Commemoration Day.\nBut in the end many, like myself, are\ngoaded into participation by vague parental threats, the chance of a day off\nwork, the opportunity to meet one's friends and the prospect of a free tea.\nDARK SATANIC MILLS\nThe proceedings of Commem Day are\napparently steeped in ritual. Like the\nTm only here because I have to be\" look\non the faces of the Students' Union and\nstaff members of the platform party, as\nwell as most of the graduates. And the\nrendering of \"Jerusalem\" with less than\nWomen's Guild gusto, and whose reference to \"dark satanic mills\" was more\nthan usually apt in the light of today's lull in employment prospects for graduates. Dave Holman, playing the part of the\nStudent Orator, proclaimed \"loyal homage to our visitor\", who, to the best\nknowledge of your FELIX scout, had\nomitted to come. Dave later expressed\namazement at the sensitivity of his micro-phone.\nPERTURBATIONS FOR SOME Lord Penney made his usual Annual Report, reaffirming the College's purpose\nto cater for the \"most advanced training\nand research . . . especially in the application to industry\".\nHe mentioned \"perturbations causing\nheadaches to a few of us\" (what on\nearth could he be talking about?) and\nprofessed interest in the \"increasing importance of industrial relations\".\nOn the financial side the authorities\nwere experiencing \"considerable anxiety\", and the (annual) running costs\n(of the College) have increased from\n\u00a36.4m four years ago to \u00a39.5m last year.\nOf this \u00a32.2m was spent on research,\nless than \u00a3600,000 coming as industrial\nsponsorship, or bribery as some would\nchurlishly have it!\nUNCLE BILL CRACKS A FUNNY Lord Penney said that the residential\nproblems of students were causing\n\"deep concern\", but that the Ravenscourt flats scheme \"promises well\". And\nthe only delectable bit of whimsey from\nthe Lord was in this connection, when\nhe suggested courses in cooking, sewing\nand cleaning to assist the flat-dwellers.\nRegarding diversification in the more\northodox sense, a perennial subject requiring a few choice platitudes on such\noccasions, Lord Penney's answer was\nthat \"the question is, where to draw\nthe line\".\nSHOCK DISCLOSURE The general part of the ceremony\ncomprises every one of last year's graduates in attendance making a small bow\nto the Chairman of the Governors, Lord\nSherfield, as the Dean of his College\nreads out his name to the assembled\ncompany. This was done at a fair old\nrate, as some perfected their \"running\nright hand bow\" as they sprinted across\nthe platform. There was some controversy as to whether Lord Sherfield was\nreally asleep and kept waking himself\nup when his chin slumped onto his\nchest.\nVARIATIONS ON A THEME Special treatment was however offered to the ladies, to whom the Lord\ngallantly doffed his hat, and to special\nprize winners, whose hands were blister-ingly shaken, to some extent discrediting the sleep theory. During this ceremony sweet music, more appropriate to\na palm court, gently fluttered in the\nbackground.\nSNUB FOR UNION\nSECRETARY The last of his group was Dave Hobman, our Union Secretary, whose full\nname had been negligently omitted\nfrom the Dean's list. In a moment of\ncrisis, the Dean (whose ability to remember students forenames must have\nbeen sorely strained, stammering ly dubbed him a derisory \"Hobman\".\nPROFESSOR PRO LIFE RAT OR Prof. Francis, playing the Staff Orator,\nwas now to wax eloquent about the five\nnew Fellows, which he did with due proliferation of Gilbert and Sullivan lyrics,\na mal constructed sentence and a verse\nof Masefield, and much more.\nOf the new Fellows, Brigadier Bagnold, of sand wave fame, took the proceedings with a scarlet countenance,\nwhilst Letitia Chitty, whose office door\ncan be viewed any time in the Civil Engineering Department, was visibly shy\nabout the oration, and seemed to express disagreement when credited as\nthe first woman Telford prize winner.\nProf. Francis afterwards mentioned his\nfear that dear old lady would fall asleep\nduring his spiel, which would have been\ntragic for her frail frame, as she was\nstanding up at the time.\nWHIZ KID SPEARS Mr. David Nicolson, a former I.C. student who (as PRIVATE EYE 257 put it)\n\"holds down a room full of chairman-ships and directorships\", also Governor\nand Fellow of the College, now took the\npart of the Special Visitor. His address,\nby previous standards, was mercifully\nbrief, but contained such gems as \"I have seen the tragedy of many engineers\nwho have chained themselves to their\ndrawing boards . . .\" and the allegation\nthat Emeritus Professor Sir Owen Saunders, a former lecturer of his student\ndays here must take some measure of\nresponsibility for what you have to put\nup with today\". A text of this speech,\nfor those interested, is presumably\navailable from the Publications Office.\nUGM ELECTIONS FOR\nNUS AND\nREPERCUSSIONS\nDespite \"Some of the\nbest ever publicity for a union meeting\" the words\nof Mr. Amos, the one two\nweeks back got under way\nfive minutes late and horribly in quo rate(140 maxi-mum). The reason for this\nsad state was undoubtedly\nthe decision to hold it in\nthe Union Upper Lounge\ninstead of the Great Hall,\npresumably part of the policy to make the Union\nbuilding more a centre of\nactivity.\nSome interesting trivia\nincluded a request from\nthe News of the World for\nstudents' experiences with\nfirms offering vacation\njobs with up to \u00a340 a week,\nonly to discover they involved encyclopedia selling\non a com misi on basis (or\nsomething similar). Also a male Bulgarian record col-lector, and student requires a pen friend. Anyone\ninterested on either count\nplease contact someone\nin the Union.\nPresident McLooge informed us that friend\nMooney had broken even\nafter only two weeks (it\ntook six last year) and will\nno doubt have amassed a large profit by the end of\nthe year. The union's solicitor will be pleased to\ntake up any cases of harassment by landlords and\nit is hoped a trial case can\nbe made against an accommodation bureau charging\nfor lists. Again anyone with\nanything to say on these\nmatters, or knows of any\nretailers, or services that\nare prepared to give USK\ncard holders a discount\nplease make yourself\nknown to a Union official.\nThe guest speaker Mike\nTerry, Secretary Elect of\nNUS, spoke at length with\nhands and mouth on the\naims of NUS. These boiled\ndown to the same as for\nany other union, namely to\nimprove the income and\nworking conditions of its\nmembers, and to fight\nagainst individual in just ic es. No one questioned that\nIC students were getting\nvalue for money for their\nsizeable contribution via IC\nUnion to the national or-gan is ation. Piers Corbyn\nthanked the NUS for its\npart in preventing a major\ninjustice (need I say\nmore?) but questioned\ntheir conciliatory methods\nin the student union autonomy issue.\nElections for IC representatives to the NUS Margate Conference followed.\nSix could go; seven wanted to. However, as McLooge was going what\nanyone said the problem\nwas to remove one out of\nsix. The six in question be-ing: Rob Armitage, Mark\nWood, Piers Corbyn, John\nMerlis, Geoff Franklin, and\nJohn Sommers. Each\nstated he wanted to go for\nfairly noble reasons, and\nall agreed that unemployment closely followed by\nstudent union autonomy\nwere the main issues. A system whereby all present voted for the candidate they least wanted to\ngo resulted in Piers being\nthe most hated.\nThis method of election\nand the result had led to\nvarious repercussions,\nsome, some not surprisingly from Piers. In a letter to\nthe Union he claims the\nresult invalid on four\ncounts (i) the result was\nvery close, only three\nvotes covering the last\nthree candidates, (ii) the\nvery poor attendance making the result unrepresentative,( iii) the negative\nvoting system resulting in\nanyone with strong views\nbeing more likely to be\neliminated, (iv) the method of voting was supposed\nto be discussed at the\nmeeting, which it was not.\nAll these are valid though\none wonders why he did\nnot make more of the last\nthree before the voting\ntook place.\nJohn Sommers has also\ncomplained about the\nnegative voting system\nand wants the result declared null and void. If not\nhe intends to vacate his\nplace and so force another\nelection. Finally more complaints have come from an\nIrish female mathematical\nfresher (sorry have not\nbeen able to discover her\nname) who also wanted to\ngo to Margate but didn't know about the meeting,\ndespite the best publicity\never.\nSTOIC cont'd from page 1\nAt the moment there\nseems little chance of further expansion from the\npresent situation, owing to\nthe high cost of the cable\nnecessary for such an op-e ration. There are some\nideas of running an extension over to Southside\nthrough one of the myriad\ntunnels which appear to\ngo just about everywhere.\nIn fact, it would only be\npractical if one of these existed as the added expense\nof installing the cable\nwould probably put it beyond the club funds. Ignoring such minor problems of financing the pro-j ect, it would be rather\nnice to have 'college-wide'\ndistribution with monitors\nplaced in strategic positions. This would really\ngive some meaning to the\nname, student T.V. of I.C. However, to get back to\nreality, I will now get down\nto the point of the whole\narticle, that is, to describe\nthe new magazine/news\nprogramme which is about\nto make its debut. It will\noccur every Thursday at 1\np.m. in the Junior Common Room, the general\nidea being that it will be\nbiased more to news interviews on the weeks that\nFelix isn't published and\nfeatures on the alternate\nweeks. Some things in\nstore are an interview with\nour well beloved President\nJohn McCullough and features on rowing, club exp e ditions, banking (I'm assured it isn't as boring as\nit sounds), films and occasional bits out of network\nprogrammes of exceptional interest. The announcer\nand interviewer on the first\nprogramme will be Dave\nWillis, who is a Computer\nScience P.G. As it stands\nthe organisers of the programme appear to be relying on the three week gap\nbetween two issues of Felix which is coming near\nthe end of term hence putting the two out of place.\nHowever, they appear to\nhave neglected the fact\nthat this disappears at the\nbeginning of next term but\nI am sure that this will be\neventually sorted out!\nSo when you finally sit\ndown to watch, bear in\nmind the difficulties that\ngo into producing a presentable television pro-gram me. Anyone can offer destructive criticism but constructive ideas are a good\ndeal more useful.\n\n"

The scoring\nwas opened when Wimbledon were caught offside\nand James kicked an easy\npenalty in front of the\nposts. However, Wimbledon equalise d when our\nlad from Wigan tripped\nover somebody's head\u2014a complete accident but\nlin; J. McDonough; A. James (Capt); C. Flanagan; M. Sugrue; H. Michael; C. Wrigley; C. Humphris; R. Matthews; T. Morris; I. Partridge; R. Howard.\nOn Wednesday 20th l.C. played an under-strength\nCity University 1st XV. After turning up with only 14\nmen another of their players was injured and City\nhad to continue with 13\nmen. This allowed i.C. to\ndominate the game and\nscore 8 tries of which two\nwere converted (James was\nWimbledon were awarded\na penalty. Two further penalties followed in the second half\u2014one for each\nside and the game being\nin the balance up until the\nlast minute when from a brilliant handling movement by the l.C. backs\nJohn McDonough scored\nin the corner to clinch the\ngame. 10 points to 6\npoints.\nScorers: McDonough\nTry. James: Penalty (2).\nTeam: J. Hughes; J. Hunt; P. Pilkington; A. Havkicking again). The final\nscore was 36-7 with City\ngetting a late try and dropped goal as a consolation.\nScorers: Numerous (I 've\nforgotten anyway).\nTeam: J. Hughes; j. McDonough; J. Hunt; B. Baines; M. Gallani; A. James (Capt.); C. Flanagan; M. Sugrue; H. Michael; C. Wrigley; C. Humphries; R. Matthews; I. Rhys;\nI. Partridge; P. Tebbett.\n23rd October l.C. played\nMarlow away in the brilliant sunshine and came\naway victorious by 20-4.\nMarlow attacked strongly\nin the first few minutes but\nthe l.C. scored a completely unexpected try when\nJames handed inside to\nTebbett and along the supporting forwards for McDonough to score in the\ncorner. The conversion\nfailed. After this supreme\neffort (?) James flaked\nand decided to have a rest\nand l.C. were reduced to\nthe men. The weakened\nteam held Marlow to 4-4 at\nhalf-time and then turned\nround with the conditions\nnow in their favour.\nStraight from the kick\noff l.C. applied pressure to\nthe Marlow line and l.C. capitalised on the Marlow\ndefensive errors to score\nthree more fine tries, two\nfrom Hunt, who left the\nMarlow full back groping\nat his heels and one when\nSugrue trundled over obviously inspired by a certain supporter on the\ntouch line. A riotous night followed\nwith this certain supporter\nenjoying the excellent\nsinging of the 1st and Ex\n1st together with an impromptu strip from a Marlow player. At the moment\nthe Ex 1st are also unbeaten having played Osterley\n(8-4) and Marlow (24-9)\nand this portends well for\na successful season to fol-low.\nScorers: Tries: Hunt (2),\nMcDonough, Sugrue.\nTeam: J.

Tebbett.\nI st XI held to a draw\nA.F.C. \u2014\nWith the league programme now underway,\nl.C. teams have once more\nshown their worth, and issued a warning to other\ncolleges of the l.C. trophy\nhunt to come.\nOn Wednesday, 20th October, l.C. ran out easy\nwinners in four league fixtures with U.C. At U.C., the scorers\nwere:\u2014\nl.C.1 st XI 3, U.C.1 st XI\n1.\nI.C.3 rd XI 1, U.C.2 nd XI\n0.\nI.C.4t hI6, U.C.4 th XI\n3\nwhile back at Harlington\nthe 2nd team beat U.C.3 rd42. The first XI, although\nrunning out 3-1 victors at\nthe final whistle, gave rather a disappointing and unimpressive performance,\nthey seemed to lack all ur-gen cy, enthusiasm and involvement in a half which\ncontained many niggling\ntactics from the op posit tion. However at half time\nthe team pulled themselves together and got down\nto some serious thought\nabout the game. This proved to be beneficial and in\nthe second half l.C. scored the two goals which\nmade the difference in the\nscore-line.\nOn Saturday, 23rd October, the firsts and seconds\ntravelled to Donnington to\nplay the P.E. College and\ncame away jubilant. Whether this outburst could\nbe attributed to their performances on the field at\nthe excess of female students at this college was\nnot determinable. Anyway\nthe firsts won 2-1, but the\nseconds lost 4-2. Meanwhile back in London the\nthirds lost 3-1 to QMC, the\nfourths drew 2-2 also with\nQMC, and the sixths beat\nChelsea seconds 5-2 in the\npreliminary round of the\ncup\u2014an extremely good\nperformance.\nOn Wednesday last, 27th October l.C. took on Kings\nat Harlington, the firsts\ndrew with Kings firsts 1-1,\nwhilst the seconds won\n3-0 against Kings seconds\nand the sixths beat Kings\nthirds 9-2. In other league\ngames the thirds lost to\nBirkbeck seconds 3-0 and\nthe fourths beat the fifths\n4-0.\nThe firsts game with\nKings was a rather medi-Fencing EDITORIAL\nOn Wednesday after-noon, 27th October, Imperial College Fencing\nteams struck again! They\nwere fencing away against\nKing's College, London.\nThe men's sabre team\nscored a great success,\nbeating King's by 8 bouts\nto 1. The ladies foil team,\nalthough short of one fen-cer, soundly managed a63 victory. Even the men's foil team won by 5 bouts\nto 4. This, considering the\nfact that King's have a much bigger fencing club\nthan l.C. is no mean feat.\nHowever to prevent\nKing's getting an inferiority complex, the l. C.e pee team allowed them to gain\na90 victory, when they\ncould murmur excuses of\nabsent fencers and scarcity of time. Due to the favourable results, King's may\neven be invited for a return match later on in the\nterm.\nThe next fencing fixture\nis most impressively\nagainst Aberystwyth University on Saturday, 30th October at home, when\none hopes the results will\nbe just as encouraging.\nCricket\nThe cricket has been\nvery successful over the\npast few years, winning\nthe U.L. U. Cup last year\nfor the 2nd year in succes-sion.\nThe Club runs five teams\n(including a Sunday XI)\nduring the season and indoor nets on Sunday afternoons during the Autumn\nand Spring terms, which\nare especially attractive to\nnew members enabling\nthem to meet senior members of the club before the\nseason ends.\nThe big attraction of the\nyear is the Annual Tow.\nTen hectic days are spent\nin Devon where much cricket is playing in between\nthe boozing and singing.\nThis event is a must. P.S. Last year we didn't lose a single match or Tow (we'll\nnever know how we did\nit!)\nAnyone interested please\ncontact Joe Williams in\nBeit Hall or Ken Schofield,\nHolbein House, 62 Evelyn\nGardens, Room 62G2. The term has started well for all sports clubs, with,\nat the time of writing, most of the clubs first teams yet\nto be beaten.\nThe 'clean-up' that has occurred in professional soccer has influenced referees of the amateur game to\nsuch an extent that two members of the Football Club\nhave already been sent off. Captains of all sides, and\nmore especially players, must now realise that arguing\nviolently with the referee besides being a disgrace to\nany game, will now lead to the 'early bath'.\nThe Pie and Mash season is now over and reflecting\nthey must be considered a success for the members\nwho attended but the purpose of introducing fresher s to 'old lags' seems to have fallen foul this year. The\nattendance of new members was poor and this could\nbe at tr ibn ted to either poor advertising by the Club\ncommittees or by early apathy being shown by the\nfresher s themselves.\nThe Badminton club have found the Great Hall to\ntheir liking and since they have convincingly won all\ntheir early matches. The Men'sI team is of exceptionally high standard and well worth watching now that\nthe home venue is so convenient.\nClub members ought to be aware that this term ACC\nhas asked the Clubs to revise or in some cases, produce their constitution. It may seem trivial and boring\nbtu it could affect the members and the club at some\nlater date.\nOnce again a reminder that on Friday, November\n5th there is to be a bonfire complete with disco, and\nhot jacketed potatoes at Harlington. All members of the\ncollege and USK are welcome.\nI.C. for sale\nIf you ever venture as far north as Neasden, you\nmight find a reservoir, known as the Welsh Harp. It is\nhere that Imperial College Sailing Club keeps its seven\nFirefly dinghies, sharing a well-equipped clubhouse,\nnew last year, with the other colleges of London University.\nEvery Wednesday, and most weekends, the boats are\nbeing used: there's instruction for beginners on Wednesdays, races on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and\nrecreational sailing on Sunays. If it is racing you find\nmost interesting, l.C. is involved in about four teams\nwhich race regularly. The U.L. team, which is of a very\nhigh standard, consists mainly of I. C.S.C. members,\nand we also manage to provide two teams for the\ninter-U.L. League races on Wednesdays, as well as a team which sails against other Universities at the\nweekends.\nI.C. is also the only college in England to own a cruiser. She is a27 foot fibreglass sloop, of the 'Folk-dancer' class, and is moored at Wralness, near Harwich, on the East Coast. She sails most weekends,\nGod and skipper willing, and goes on cruises lasting\nfor a week or two during the vacation. Although weekend cruises are really restricted to East Coast 'hops',\nshe has been on cruises to Scandinavia, France, Belgium, etc., and even as far as the Isle of Wight. Financially, Ichthyosaurus (Icky for short) is entirely self-sustaining, so although the dinghy-sailing is free once\nyou have paid your subscription, we have to make an\nadditional hire charge for the use of the cruiser. It's always easy for us to find crews, but we are constantly on the look-out for skippers, so get in touch\nif you've done any cruising before, or even if you're just\ninterested.\nIf you want any more information, have a look at the\nSailing Club notice-board, outside the Union Bar, or\nsee me, Graham Eastwood, in Weeks 61, or Mike Martin, in Keogh 266. For cruising see Henry Shaw, in\nTizard 552. Alternatively, just come up to the Harp\none Wednesday; we usually take people up in the\nR.C. C. Crewbus from Southside at 1 p.m. Hope to see\nyou there.\nGraham Eastwood, Commodore, I.C.S. C.o c re affair. Kings started\nvery well and had l.C. defending desperately, but\nthe l.C. defence only\ncracked once in the first\nhalf to give Kings a10 lead at half-time even\nthough they had come\nclose to scoring on previous occasions. However\nduring the second half l.C. came more into the game\nand managed to pull back\nthe goal which was necessary to share the points.\nAgain this was a rather\ndisappointing show by a first team which should be\npromising well, and it was\nobvious that a lot more\nthought should be given to\nthe game by each individual player before taking\nthe field. However with\nsome hard, thoughtful\nwork and training the preliminary teething troubles\nwill be overcome, but it\nwon't be easy.\n\n"
