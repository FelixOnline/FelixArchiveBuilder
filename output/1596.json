    "content": "10 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n6.02.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nReligion should be a private matter\nIwas seven years old when I first\nself-identified as an atheist.\nI remember the setting vividly.\nI was in a social studies class in the\nsecond grade. My teacher \u2013 the\nAmerican education system\u2019s answer\nto Margaret Thatcher, albeit with less\ncharm \u2013 was explaining the concept\nof religious diversity by going around\nthe class, asking us about how we\nobserve religion at home. When it\ncame to my turn, I dithered, not\nknowing how to answer. Religion was\na neglected topic in my family; my\nfather turned away from religion in\nhis youth, and my mother \u2013 while\ntechnically Hindu \u2013 kept to her own\npersonal spirituality and beliefs. At\nthe age of seven, I had never been\nto mass in my life, and had only\never stepped inside a synagogue\nfor family events. I had the vaguest\nunderstanding of Christianity and\nHinduism, but would not learn\nabout Islam for another two years.\nSo when I was inevitably asked about\nmy religion, I simply replied with\nsomething along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t\nhave one\u201d. The looks I received from\na large number of my classmates \u2013 a\nmixture of incredulity and odium\n\u2013 still resonate with me to this day.\nFor a long time after that, I kept my\nreligious viewpoints exclusively to\nmyself.\nI write this because my experience\nin that second grade class is very\nmuch a vignette for attitudes\ntowards atheists in America (and\nelsewhere in the world) today. That\nit was considered acceptable for my\nteacher to pick out students based\non their religion is telling enough\nabout America\u2019s lax attitudes\nto constitutionally enshrined\nsecularism. Yet in the US, atheism\nis seen by many as evil, and\nfundamentally un-American, an\nattitude perfectly encapsulated by\nthen president George H. W. Bush,\nwho famously said of atheists that \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know that atheists should be\nregarded as citizens, nor should they\nbe regarded as patriotic. This is one\nnation under God.\u201d Bush\u2019s view is one\nshared by the majority of Americans;\na Pew survey in 2007 found that just\nover 60% of Americans would not\nvote for an atheist president, however\nqualified. A follow-up survey in 2014\nfound that atheists and Muslims\nvie for last place concerning public\nperception of religious beliefs.\nOf course, I am lucky to have\nidentified as non-religious in the\nUS, where atheism only results in\nmild stigmatisation, and a de facto\nrestriction in my ability to run for\npublic office. In seven countries\nthroughout the world (Afghanistan,\nQatar, Saudi Arabia, the United\nArab Emirates, Brunei, Mauritius,\nand Yemen), to be non-religious is to\ninvite the death penalty. Elsewhere,\natheism and secularism is met by\ncold stigmatisation, and criticism\nof religion is zealously silenced\nby governments, fanatics, and\nlaw enforcement the world over.\nEven in the UK, a relative bastion\nof secularism, it is not enough for\nmany adherents of religion to simply\nallow those who do not follow their\nfaith to simply go about their lives\nunmolested by their fervent desire\nto impose their atavistic worldview\non those who have no want or need\nfor it. I have lost count of the number\nof times I have been accosted by\nMormons on my morning commute;\nor have had a tract shoved into my\nhand by a saccharinely smiling\nJehovah\u2019s Witness; or else have\nbeen rendered deaf by megaphone\nwielding Muslim preachers. In every\nsingle case, my desire to remain\nquietly secular is challenged at\nevery turn with a kind of simpering\npassive-aggressiveness that belies a\nfundamental and deep-seated lack of\nrespect.\nIn world politics too, religion\naggressively ingratiates itself. In\nIreland, Catholic beliefs in the\nprinciple of life \u2018beginning at\nCan Gods be respected unless they respect atheists? Photo: YouTube\nNathaniel Gallop thinks respect for beliefs must be given to be received\nconception\u2019 precipitated an outright\nban on abortion procedures regardless\nof a woman\u2019s religious or personal\nbeliefs. In the USA, the retail chain\nHobby Lobby successfully argued its\nway out of providing certain legally\nmandated forms of healthcare on the\nbasis that it did not agree with the\nreligion of the company\u2019s owners. In\nthe UK, religious advocacy groups\nwere instrumental in the successful\npush for legislation banning certain\nforms of pornography over the\nprevious summer. Around the world,\nreligiously motivated prejudices have\nresulted in the establishment of a\nmorass of legislation which censures,\nstigmatises, and criminalises\nhomosexuality. Note that in every\ncase, it is not enough for these men\nand women of faith to simply observe\nthe details of their religious morality\nin private, it must be forced upon\nevery single person, regardless of\nwhatever belief system they adhere\nto.\nIt is as a result of this that I am\nforced to roll my eyes as the cries\nfor \u2018respect\u2019 espoused from Muslim,\nChristian, and Jewish scholars in the\nwake of the Charlie Hebdo shootings.\nEven the avowedly progressive Pope\nFrancis stipulated in his speech\nconcerning the attacks that: \u201cOne\ncannot provoke; one cannot insult\nother people\u2019s faith; one cannot make\nfun of faith.\u201d Yet, at every turn, the\nsecular worldview is challenged,\nderided, and elsewhere undermined\nby many people of faith, while death\nawaits those who criticise or deride\nreligion, along with the tacit, finger-wagging defence that they quite\nfrankly brought it upon themselves.\nIt is an attitude that smacks of\nhypocrisy of the utmost highest\ndegree.\nAdherents of religion must decide\nwhat is most important to them, the\ndesire to see their religion respected,\nor the desire to ingratiate their beliefs\ninto the public sphere. If they choose\nthe latter, then they have adopted a\nposition of power that necessarily\nattracts criticism and ridicule; after\nall, we do this to our politicians at\nevery opportunity. If the religiose\nwish to aggressively preach, then they\nmay expect their lack of respect to be\nreciprocated in kind.\nWhen religion becomes a private\nmatter, kept out of our schools,\ncourts and parliament, and when\nI am able to walk down the street\nwithout attempts at conversion\nthrown disrespectfully my way, then\nI will march with the hundreds of\nMuslims, Christians and Jews calling\nfor religious respect. Until that time,\nJe suis Charlie, r\u00e9solument!\n\n"

It also has been\ncriticised for the pressure it puts on\ninstitutions to monitor its students\nand report them for behavioural\npatterns that aren\u2019t even specified in\nthe bill.\nUniversities do have a\nresponsibility to ensure their\nstudents debate and discuss\ncontroversial ideas, but they also\nhave a responsibility to ensure their\nstudents graduate as well-rounded,\nconsiderate members of society.\nAlthough this is obviously easier\nsaid than done, the university needs\nto at least provide an environment\nthat nurtures free speech and\nfreethinking. It also needs to provide\none that doesn\u2019t allow students to\nshrink away into isolation, and be\ndrawn in to dangerous propaganda\nthat can encourage those who are\nmost vulnerable to find solace in\ngroups and organisations that are\nviolent and threatening.\nIt is difficult to quantify elements\nsuch as these, and even more\nproblematic trying to find solutions\nto issues that aren\u2019t really understood\nin the first place. The bill, based on\nprevious legislation that was hastily\npulled together in response to a very\nshocking but also very real threat,\nneeds to be thought through more\ncarefully. Consulting universities\nabout what they think is a step in the\nright direction, but more should be\ndone.\nWith the press very much still\nfocusing on acts of terrorism,\nand with people looking to the\ngovernment to shield and protect our\ncommunities, it is easy to see why\nthese bills are in such demand.\nHowever, unless more consultation\nis put into these documents, they\nmay end up doing more damage than\ngood.\nWhat\u2019s on this week:\nThe Union Council\nTuesday 10th February\n6pm until we get bored and\ngo home\nCome one, come all to the\ngreat debate of at least\nnext week. It is going to be\nmental.\nWe are going to talk about\nfossil fuels, terrorism,\ntampons and how Chris\nalways contributes to\nstudent media when\nappropriate.\n\n"

Photo: NASA/Hubble\nAstrophysicist Professor Alan Heavens talks to Ben Fernando about\nhow we measure distances in the universe\n\u201cIf we\nlook at the\ngeometry\nof the\nuniverse,\nwe can\nlearn about\nwhat\u2019s in\nit.\u201d\nBen Fernando: So why is it\nimportant to measure distances in\ncosmology?\nAlan Heavens: According to General\nRelativity, the Universe\u2019s geometry is\nrelated to its matter content. So if we\nlook at the geometry of the universe,\nwe can tell something about what\u2019s\nin it \u2013 which we\u2019re obviously very\ninterested in because we don\u2019t know\nwhat 96% of the energy density is!\nIn order to investigate the geometry\nof the Universe, we need to measure\ndistances, and we do this using\n\u2018standard rulers\u2019. For example, in\nnormal [Euclidian] space, if you place\na ruler in the sky at a given distance\nand then double this distance, the\nsize of the ruler halves. However, this\nis not the case in curved space. Some\nmodels predict that a distant ruler\nwill start getting bigger again as it gets\nfurther away, so if we observe this we\nknow that particular model is correct.\nBF: So clearly these \u2018standard\nrulers\u2019 are very important, but\nwhat exactly are they?\nAH: They\u2019re the size of the Universe\u2019s\nsound horizon, which is about\n470 million light years (roughly\n4.4x1024\nm).\nToday, sound waves no longer\npropagate through the Universe,\nbecause the density is too low.\nHowever, not long after the Big Bang\nwhen the Universe was much denser\nand hotter, the radiation pressure\nprovided support to the gas that filled\nthe Universe and this allowed sound\nwaves to propagate.\nMatter and radiation were strongly\ncoupled, and oscillated together as\nsound passed through them. Back\nthen, sound waves moved with speeds\ncomparable to the speed of light.\nAfter about 400,000 years, the matter\nand the radiation decoupled, and the\nphotons stopped exerting pressure\non the gas, so sound waves could\nno longer propagate. This created a\n\u2018sound horizon\u2019 that constrains what\nthe Universe\u2019s expansion rate was\nsoon after the Big Bang.\nMeasuring the size of the Universe\u2019s\nsound horizon (the \u2018standard ruler\u2019) is\nclearly very important! But we found\nthat no one had actually measured\nit. The sound horizon left a small\nimprint in the matter distribution of\nthe Universe, and at certain points\nthis results in an excess of galaxies\nthat we can observe and measure.\nHowever, when we make these\nmeasurements all we can actually do\nis measure the angular separation\nof galaxies on the sky. To translate\nthese angles into physical distances\nrequires us to know the geometry of\nthe Universe.\nMost calculations in the past have\nassumed a certain geometry and\nfrom that calculated the separation\nbetween galaxies, but it turns out this\nisn\u2019t actually necessary \u2013 all we need\nto do is assume that the Universe has\ncertain symmetries, we don\u2019t even\nneed to consider General Relativity.\nBF: How does this come in useful?\nAH: Well, we now have an almost\nmodel-independent measurement\nof the length of the \u2018standard ruler\u2019.\nWe\u2019ve not made assumptions about\nwhat sort of Universe we live in,\nor about the nature of General\nRelativity.\nAll we\u2019ve assumed is the\nCosmological Principle, that we\ndon\u2019t live in a special place within\nthe Universe \u2013 and all the data we\nhave so far suggests that this is a valid\nassumption.\nNow that we have a measurement\nof this length, all theories about\nthe Universe will have to make\npredictions that are in agreement\nwith our value, or else be discarded.\nBF: And how long is this length?\nAH: About 143\u00b13.5 Mpc (4.4x1024\nm).\nBF: How did you acquire the data\nneeded to make this measurement?\nAH: As I mentioned previously, the\neffect of sound waves in the early\nuniverse creates a small increase in\nthe number of galaxies at certain\nseparations. We looked at surveys\nof about a million galaxies for this,\nand then at data from about 750\nsupernova explosions to constrain the\nexpansion history of the Universe.\nBF: So what will be the next step\nwith this research?\nAH: We\u2019d like to use some bigger\nsurveys to make our measurements\nmore precise. The length of the\nstandard ruler is affected by the\nnumber of neutrino species that exist,\nand right now our measurements\nconfirm that there are definitely no\nmore than four species, and probably\nno more than three. More data would\nhelp us to confirm that there are\nindeed only three species of neutrino.\nOur measurements allow us to look\nat a time when the Physics of the\nUniverse was very simple, so we can\ncome to robust conclusions that may\nor may not be caused by the effects of\ndark energy.\n\u201cAll new\ntheories\nabout the\nUniverse\nwill have to\nagree with\nour value,\nor else be\ndiscarded.\u201d\n\n"

Dr King did more\nthan give that speech, and the events\nof Selma in fact come after that\nlandmark moment and the march to\nWashington. Ava DuVernay\u2019s new\nfilm instead focuses on the Selma to\nMontgomery marches that took place\nthat led to the passage of the Voting\nRights Act.\nDespite the passage of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, AfricanAmericans are still being refused\nwhen trying to register to vote, as\nevidenced by Annie Lee Cooper\n(Oprah Winfrey, in a brief but\nimportant role), who is unfairly\nquizzed and discriminated against\nat the voters registration office in\nSelma, Alabama. Dr King sees Selma\nas the new battleground, and sets\nup base there with his supporters.\nMeetings with President Lyndon B.\nJohnson (Tom Wilkinson) are never\nas fruitful as he would hope, with the\nPresident never promising, but only\ncautiously reassuring Dr King that\nthings will change with time. Peaceful\ndemonstrations are organised, ones\nthat inevitably end up in blood-soaked tragedy as certain members\nof the law refuse to see past people\u2019s\ncolour.\nDavid Oyelowo is mesmerising as\nKing, disappearing into the iconic\nrole as the takes centre stage. His\nSELMA\nDirector: Ava DuVernay\nScreenplay: Paul Webb\nCast: David Oyelowo,\nCarmen Ejogo, Tim Roth, Tom\nWilkinson, Oprah Winfrey\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\ncommanding, inspirational lead\nperformance is an award-worthy one,\nand the lack of an Oscar nomination\nin the Best Actor field for Oyelowo\nwill become something that will\nalways appear in the \u2018snubbed\u2019 lists\nfor years to come. His character is put\nthrough a lot; he has many speeches\nto make in front of crowds; but he\nalso has the behind-the-scenes, more\nintimate, personal look at his private\nlife, and the toll this Movement is\ntaking on him, and Brit revelation\nOyelowo is faultless in every frame.\nHe is backed by a strong supporting\ncast that includes two Brits in the\nroles that stand in the way of Dr\nKing\u2019s dream. Wilkinson is stoic and\ndignified as the President caught in\na difficult situation. It would be lazy\nto label him as simply the villain;\nthe film does well to explain his\npredicament throughout the film.\nWhilst Dr King\u2019s goal is a simple one,\nPOTUS instead has a lot of things\nto juggle and people to please. The\nreal antagonist here is Tim Roth as\nAlabama Governor George Wallace,\nwho does his absolute best to come\nacross the most detestable man\nimaginable, and Roth succeeds in that\nrespect.\nMost surprising however, is how\nDr King\u2019s wife, Coretta Scott King\u2019s\n(Carmen Ejogo) role is handled. The\nclich\u00e9d long-suffering spouse of a\nfamous historical figure is a tiresome\none, but here Ejogo is given more\nmaterial than would usually be given\nfor a supporting performance. She is\nright to be worried for her husband\nand for her family, but there is an\nair of warmth and genuine concern\nthat surrounds Ejogo\u2019s effortless\nperformance.\nDuVernay\u2019s film and the images\nit portrays is shockingly relevant\neven to this day. A young black teen\ngetting shot at point blank range\nby a white police officer echoes\nthe countless shootings that have\nhappened in the States of late, and\nthere is no getting over how such a\nthing only became a national issue in\nthe 1960s, merely five decades or so in\nthe past. The marches themselves are\na sight to behold, with people from\nall over the United States coming\nover to join in the fight. There\nare unexpected casualties, and an\ninfuriating body toll where even one\ndeath is one too many. Even audience\nmembers far removed from this part\nof history will find something to\nadmire and appreciate in the stirring\nSelma, an under-appreciated film\nthat is not getting nearly as much\nattention as it should be.\nPhoto: Ava DuVernay, Paramount Pictures\nTHE INTERVIEW\nDirectors: Evan Goldberg, Seth\nRogen\nScreenplay: Dan Sterling\nCast: James Franco, Seth\nRogen, Randall Park\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nJacques Audiard\u2019s Rust and Bone\nno longer takes the crown for\nthe best use of a Katy Perry song.\nThis award now surely goes to The\nInterview, a film that has become a\nlot more famous thanks to a certain\ncountry\u2019s rather irrational reaction\ntowards the film\u2019s release. After\nthis you will never hear the song\n\u2018Firework\u2019 the same way again. The\ncontroversy-ridden comedy starts out\nwith James Franco and Seth Rogen\nas two ordinary Americans working\nin the entertainment industry\nunwittingly recruited by the CIA to\nachieve the almost impossible \u2013 to\nassassinate the leader of North Korea,\nKim Jung Un (Randall Park). Turns\nout, Kim is a big fan of the chat show\nhosted by Dave Skylark (Franco), and\nproduced by Aaron Rapaport (Rogen).\nFranco and Rogen are essentially\nplaying the same roles they have done\nin their many, many collaborative\nfilms. It takes a while to get used to\nthe over-the-top, chaotic behaviour\nof Skylark, often more irritating than\nanything else from the moment he\nappears on the screen, but thankfully\nfor the audience there is Rapaport\u2019s\ncharacter to keep things a little more\ngrounded in the opening scenes.\nBefore entering North Korea\nas Kim\u2019s invited leaders there are\nmoments of hilarity as Skylark and\nRapaport get settled into their new\nroles of working as spies. The two\nactors once again share a brilliant\nchemistry, going through the ups and\ndowns that test their friendship and\npush their buttons.\nEvents become more complicated\nas Skylark in particular gets to\nknow the North Korean leader on a\npersonal level; it turns out that Kim\nis not quite as evil as the Western\nmedia has portrayed him to be\nover all these years. He is a leader\nstruggling to appease his people, live\nup to the standard of being a feared,\nruthless President while living under\nthe shadow of his father who has set\nthe bar pretty high when it comes to\ndoing anything that violates human\nrights, when he would rather be\nsitting around sipping on margaritas,\nlistening to Katy Perry, his guilty\npleasure music, whilst playing\nbasketball. It is an interesting,\ncomical take on a real-life figure we\nthink we know well. Not that this\nfilm is in any way trying to convey\nsomething non-fictional in the\nnarrative, but the image of the leader\nof North Korea being a cheerful,\nboyish man-child played brilliantly\nby Park certainly has its moments of\nhighly effective comedy.\nIt does start to lose it in the film\u2019s\nclimax \u2013 there is a vomit-inducing\nburst of a violent action sequence\nthat involves the control of a joystick\nstuck inside an unlucky North\nKorean soldier\u2019s orifice, but aside\nfrom that grim/riotous (delete\nas appropriate) addition, there is\nnothing too creative that will hold\nyour attention. The jokes on offer\nare a mixed bag of hits and misses,\nranging from poking fun at racial\nstereotypes, to the juvenile poop\njokes, often venturing into the more\nadult world of sexual misadventures\nand innuendos.\nNorth Korea was right to be upset\nby this of course; no one wants to see\ntheir Supreme Leader portrayed in\nthis way, but here it is anyway, for the\nrest of world to sit back and laugh at\nhow easy it would be to achieve peace\nand democracy in North Korea. Just\nask Seth Rogen and James Franco.\nPhoto: Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen, Columbia Pictures\n\n"

I\nremember seeing many videos\nof the game before I played it and\nthinking this doesn\u2019t look that scary,\nso ignorantly I downloaded the free\nindie game and began to play.\nThe game sees your character\nalone in a dark forest searching for\neight pieces of paper which appear\nin random locations around a map.\nArmed only with your torch you must\ncollect these pages while being stalked\nby the Slenderman, a tall skinny\nman wearing a suit with no facial\nfeatures. It sounds easy, and thats\nwhat I thought, but I soon realised\nthat what makes this game hard is\nthat it terrifies me every time I play\nit. The game is very simple but the\natmosphere created by the creepy\ndissonant piano music, the sounds\nof the forest and footsteps when\nyou aren\u2019t walking make you very\naware that you are being stalked. To\nadd to this every time you collect a\npage the rhythmic beating you hear\nin the game gets faster and indeed\nSlenderman get\u2019s faster too. He even\nhas the ability to teleport! The most\nscary thing about this game is that\nthe way Slenderman takes you is by\nyou looking at him too long. It\u2019s very\nhard to walk around alone in this\ndark forest without wanting to look\nbehind you and when you do and see\nhim you can\u2019t help but jump and lose\nthose precious seconds you need to\nescape. He doesn\u2019t move when you\nlook at him but the screen becomes\nfull of static. Run a bit forward and\nthen check behind you again and\nhe will have moved much closer to\nyou. The only way to beat the game\nis to be fearless and never look back,\nsomething that took me a while to\nmaster and even now he still scares\nme.\nIt is with some amount of bravery\nthat I then bought the second, longer\nSlender game, Slender: The Arrival. The\nfirst thing I noticed about this game\nis that the world really is beautiful.\nYou start out in a forest in gorgeous\nsunshine, and you can\u2019t help but feel\nsafe. Instantly you are aware of all\nthe controls, mainly clicking and\nwalking and you are free to enjoy\nthe scenery. For some reason your\ncharacter is holding a camcorder\n(much like in Outlast but without the\nnight vision) but this can be turned\noff for true immersion in the world.\nAs you progress further from the\nsafety of your car and further into\nthe forest the game makes you feel\nThe games section here at Felix\nperiodically get free games in\nto review. In the past, these\nhave included such greats as Euro\nBus Simulator 2 (see my past review).\nWhile these simulator games are fun\nto review I was very pleased when the\nopportunity arose to play upcoming\nPSVita game Baboon, as puzzle games\nare something I know more about.\nThe game did not disappoint and I\nhope that this review will reveal why.\nBaboon is a game from spanish\nindie developers Relevo. You play\nas a monkey who must collect the\nbananas that the evil Pirate monkey\nhas made float up into the sky.\nTo do this you must light and set\noff bombs under yourself which\npropel you into the sky. You can\nfine tune your flight by selecting\nthe strength of the bomb and\nalso the position. The strength is\nselected using a meter which goes\nup and down, and you must time\nyour launch carefully to attain\nthe required speed. Likewise you\nmust place the bomb carefully so\nthat you fly through the air on the\nproper trajectory. It is this simple\nmain game mechanic that could be\nlearnt in seconds and take hours\nto master that makes the game so\naddictive. I like to think of it as a\nmixture between golf, Angry Birds\nand Tiddlywinks. Flying yourself\nthrough the air sounds easy but, you\nmust avoid enemies, collect bananas\nand do so in a time limit or with\nvarious other challenges if you are\ngoing for 100%.\nAs you progress you get more\nitems and are able to complete more\ncomplex levels which helps to keep\nthe game fresh and interesting. In\naddition to these fun puzzle levels,\nof which some are very challenging\nand rewarding to complete, is a fun\nbackground story where you can\nspeak to the other monkeys, and\ntrade items in order to unlock more\nitems for yourself. Sometimes after\ncompleting a particularly hard level\nit is relaxing to partake in these side\nquests.\nOverall Baboon is a very solid\ngame. It is fun, has a lovely Japanese\nart style and a great soundtrack. The\nlevels are simple, varied enough and\noffer enough challenge to keep even\nseasoned platformers coming back\nto it.\nIf the levels prove too hard at first\nyou can spend time chatting with\nthe other monkeys and spend your\nhard earned bananas on power up\nitems to help you.\nThe short nature of the levels\nmakes this the perfect game to play\non a commute to work and I would\nrecommend that everyone starts\nplaying this and not Candy Crush or\nAngry Birds!\nuneasy. Is someone watching you? By\nthe time you reach your friends house\nyou suddenly realise, the game has\nprogressed to night seamlessly. Slender\nat night is still a beautiful game but I\ncouldn\u2019t help but be terrified.\nA lot of this game takes place\nmuch like the original, there is a\nfind-eight-pages level and a turn-on-six-generators level but the random\nplacements of these items and the\ndifferent levels in which you must\ncomplete these objectives does make\nthis game fun to play and replay.\nThere are a few well planned jump\nscares but overall it is the atmosphere\nof this game and the fact that you\nmust constantly keep moving which\nmakes this game terrifying and\nexciting.\nThe game is short but the variety of\nlevels and items to collect make it good\nvalue for money. In contrast to the\nscary nature of the game, the Steam\nachievements offer some humour,\nsuch as the achievement for using the\nplayground slide in the first level and\nacknowledging that when Slenderman\nis in sight you are unable to pause the\ngame which makes fun of your frantic\nattempts to pause the game to escape\nhim.\nOverall Slender: The Arrival is a good\nscenic short horror game that should\nbelong in your game collection if you\nare brave enough.\nIt started my love of Horror games\nand I have now played (among others)\nOutlast, Amnesia and Alien Isolation,\nbut nothing amounts to the terror I\nfeel for Slendy. This game may stop\nany dreams you have of living on a\nfarm or ever going into a forest but it\nwill provide you with adrenaline like\nno other game. I know.\n\"Slender\nat night\nis still a\nbeautiful\ngame but\nI couldn\u2019t\nhelp but be\nterrified. \"\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 9\nFELIX 6.02.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Greens have been all over\nthe news recently, from David\nCameron\u2019s insistence that they\nappear in general election debates\nearlier this year, to the announcement\nthat their membership has surpassed\nthat of UKIP and is rapidly rising.\nThe Green Party would have us\nbelieve that this is the beginning of\na new wave of left-wing, ecologically\nand economically responsibly\npolitics, a \u2018Green Surge\u2019 to wash away\nthe ossified major parties and the\ndangerously populist UKIP.\nFor all of the talk of fairness and\na bright new future, my advice is to\nsteer well clear.\nScience policy is a litmus test in\npolitics. American Republicans and\nour own UKIP are ridiculous in their\ninsistence that anthropogenic climate\nchange is \u2018not a thing\u2019, and their\nscience and environment policies\nread like they were written on the\nback of a cigarette packet by Alan\nPartridge. In its own slightly more\nsubtle way the Green Party can be just\nas bad.\nThe Greens talk a lot about ending\nworld hunger and tackling poverty.\nThis is why we saw the Green Party,\nrepresented by senior party members\nsuch as their London mayoral\ncandidate Jenny Jones, tacitly endorse\nthe vandalism and destruction of\npublicly funded GM crop research\nat Rothamstead in 2012. This\nresearch, which has nothing to do\nwith any agri-business or big bad\ncorporate entity, aimed to reduce\nthe use of harmful pesticides in the\nproduction of wheat. This would\nincrease the yield of staple crops and\nreduce dangerous chemical runoff; it\nwould benefit the environment and\nchip away at hunger. This was not\nimportant to the Greens.\nThey are very keen to say that\nwe should take action on carbon\nemissions and energy: I mean, why\nelse would they insist that we turn\noff all of the nuclear power stations.\nThe leader of the Green Party, Natalie Bennett Photo: Guardian\nNICK FARMER\nCOMMENT WRITER\nIt\u2019s not like the largest source of\nlow carbon electricity is something\nthat would help towards those aims,\nor that the European country with\nthe lowest CO2\nemissions (a clue\n\u2013 baguettes and infidelity) makes\nextensive use of unfashionable\nbut clean nuclear power. Instead\nthey say that we should get arms\nmanufacturers to make windmills\nand solar panels, which is code for\n\u201cimport gas from Russia and coal\nfrom Australia\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t\nunderstand the need for a mix of\ndifferent energy sources\u201d.\nThey are too bogged down in\nnarratives of science and progress\n\u2018flying too close to the sun\u2019 and\n\u2018meddling with nature\u2019 to realise that\nthe solutions to the problems that\nthey identify are to a large extent\nscientific and technological. A train\nride down the Green heartland,\nBrighton Pavilion, illustrates this\nvery well: Advertisements for palm\nreaders, astrologers, and all kinds of\ncharlatans catering to the credulous\nabound. This is the scientific and\nrational universe of the Green Party.\nRun for the hills.\nSyriza\u2019s victory in the Greek\nelections in January is the most\nimportant event to take place in\nSpain and Greece since the outbreak\nof the 2010 Eurozone crisis forced the\nre-shuffle of popular left-wing parties.\nSyriza was formed in 2004, mainly\nfrom breakaways from the Greek\nCommunist Party (KKE). The party\ngained momentum in 2012 when it\nbecame the second biggest party in\nthe Greek election, despite a massive\nnegative publicity campaign by the\ninternational media. With the support\nof the wage-earning working classes\nand the Greek intelligentsia, Syriza\nhas a similar electoral base to West\nEuropean socialist parties in their\nheydays; yet around 2012 it also had\na vibrant \u2018movementist\u2019 element far\nmore comfortable with the spectrum\nof radical currents than traditional\nparties of the Left.\nSyriza is clearly a party with\nsignificant internal divides. Though\nthis has been in many ways one of\ntheir greatest assets, it may now\nprove infelicitous. In 2013, Syriza\nmerged from a coalition into a unitary\nparty in a process that centralised\npower around the pugnacious but\neconomically moderate leader Alexis\nTsipras, yet simultaneously increased\nthe influence of the Left Platform (LP),\ngoing from 25% to 30% of seats won on\nSyriza\u2019s central committee.\nThe central difference in policy\nbetween Tsipras (and the Syrizian\nright) and the LP is on the issue of\nGreek exit from the Euro (\u2018Grexit\u2019).\nThe former are unequivocally against\nGrexit: the most blunt opponent,\nYiannis Stathakis, may become\nEconomics Minister, while the more\nnuanced views of the party\u2019s foremost\neconomics spokesman, Yiannis\nDragasakis, do not change this essential\nantinomy. Whatever the relative\nmerits of the monetary union, I find\nit hard to see how a party essentially\nidentified for its anti-austerity position\nwill avoid betraying its voters and the\nEU, International Monetary Fund,\nand European Central Bank enforced\nausterity. Symptomatically, there is a\nconspicuous absence of any advance\nprogramme of action detailed by the\nleadership. This can hardly be said of\nthe LP; currently led by Panagiotis\nLafazanis, the LP have a detailed\nCHRISTY KELLY\nCOMMENT WRITER\nprogram for Grexit.\nFaced by an intellectually superior\ninternal opposition, it will be curious\nto see how Tsipras reacts to the new\nconditions of power. The progress of\nthe coalition with the populist rightwing party Independent Greeks is as\nyet unclear, though possibly motivated\non Tsipras\u2019 part by a desire to undercut\ninternal Left opposition. However,\ndespite a negative elective affinity\nbetween Independent Greeks and the\nLP, economically it seems reasonable\nto assume that an anti-immigrant\nparty may well prove hostile to the\nEuro. The choice could of course\nhave been motivated by the dearth\nof appropriate coalition partners,\nwith neo-fascist Golden Dawn, lately\nincumbent New Democracy, and the\nnominally Left PASOK all excluded\nfrom consideration. Independent\nGreeks, though, remain a volatile\nfactor. Still, this piece is not a proleptic\nfor Syriza\u2019s inevitable failure.\nGramsci said to accompany the\npessimism of the intellect with the\n\u2018optimism of the will\u2019. The Greek\npeople understood; let us hope Syriza\ndoes also.\nDon\u2019t get swept away by the Green Surge\nNick Farmer doesn\u2019t think that there\u2019s any rationale in being Green\nFor Syriza and the Left Platform\n\"Syriza is\nclearly a\nparty with\nsignificant\ninternal\ndivides.\"\n\"...it seems\nreasonable\nto assume\nthat an\nanti-immigrant\nparty may\nwell prove\nhostile to\nthe Euro. \"\nChristy Kelly discusses divides within the party taking Greece by storm\n\n"

The Clock had been\nnon-operational for over three years\nafter the original control system\non Campus was removed and a\nreplacement mechanism failed.\nThe project to repair the Clock was\nundertaken as a memorial to Imperial\nalumnus Andrew \u2018Wiz\u2019 Wilson who\npassed away last year. He had been\ninvolved in looking after Jezebel, the\n1916 Fire Engine mascot of the RCSU,\nfor over 40 years and was an active\nmember of the \u201822 Club.\nMembers from RCS Motor Club\nand the \u201822 Club dismantled the old\nclock mechanism and removed the\nhands of the clock before Christmas\nas they had identified that parts of\nthe original drive mechanism had\nbeen become damaged by the new\ncontrol unit, which had been installed\nto take over the running of the clock\nafter College dismantled the central\ncontrol unit that drove all the clocks\non campus.\nDr Andrew Pugh, alumnus,\nthen re-wound the solenoid and\nassembled a control unit based on a\nprogrammable computer with a radio\nreceiver, enabling the system to access\nthe UK\u2019s national civil time signal\nbroadcast from Cumbria. The new\nsystem was installed last Saturday\nThe clock, in Beit Quad, had been non-operational for over three years.\nPhoto: Stephen Ball\nAn email was sent out this week\nto all second year physics\nstudents, apologising for the\ndepartment\u2019s response to a series of\nexam blunders that went uncorrected.\nAn assessed problem sheet (APS)\nfeatured a mistake in one of the\nquestions, and after students raised\nthe issue, was told to \u201ctake it on the\nchin\u2026it\u2019s a drop in the ocean.\u201d\nThis follows a similar incident that\ntook place last term, after students\nrelayed to another member of staff\nthat a multiple choice question in\na revision maths test didn\u2019t have a\ncorrect answer. Again students were\ntold it was too insignificant to be\nrectified.\nThe email, sent by Senior Teaching\nFellow Dr Vijay Tymms, stated: \u201cI\napologise for the way I handled the\nincident and any upset caused\u2026I\u2019ll try\nand pause for thought in the future.\u201d\nHe also invited any students\naffected to email him directly with\nthe marks they think they deserve,\nand he will alter them accordingly.\n\u201cNo need to send any proof, I\u2019ll take\nyour word for it. I should have said\nsomething akin to this in the first\nplace,\u201d said Tymms.\nBack in December, students\nnoticed that a question on an APS\nwas incorrect a few days before it was\ndue to be submitted, and contacted\nTymms about the issue.\nAfter a corrected version of the\nquestion was sent out to the second\nyear students, Tymms also emailed to\naddress what those who have already\nsubmitted their APS should do.\nHe told them he\u2019d prefer students\nsimply take \u201cthis on the chin, as it\u2019s a\ndrop in the ocean really and it\u2019ll save\ntime for everyone, but of course I\nunderstand if you want to claim full\ncredit if hard done by.\u201d\nLast October, Professor Warren\nwho oversees the maths revision test,\nwas emailed about a question in the\ntest, which was thought to not have a\ncorrect option in the multiple-choice\nquestions.\nWarren replied to students in\nJanuary, confirming that their\nsuspicions about the impossible\nquestion were correct. Warren\nadmitted that the question had\nbeen used in this identical format\nfor several years, and said it was\n\u201cpeculiar\u201d that it had not been\nspotted before.\nHe also told the students that the\nconsequences were \u201cvery minor\u201d and\nsaid that changing the scores of the\ntest in light of this error would make\nno difference.\nThe student who spotted the error\nthen challenged Warren, but Warren\ndid not relent in his decision. He told\nthe student: \u201cI don\u2019t see a fairer way\nof dealing with it other than to ignore\nit.\u201d\nHowever, once the issue was\nforwarded through to Tymms, it\nwas decided that the question would\nbe struck from the exam and a new\nmark would be assigned from the\nremaining questions.\nOne student elegantly concluded\nthat: \u201cthe department doesn\u2019t seem to\nrealise that even an ocean is made up\nof a finite number of drops.\u201d\nFelix spoke to Professor Warren,\nwho told us why he initially thought\nit was best to ignore the error: \u201cGiven\nPhysics apologise over exam blunders\nUnion Clock in Beit Quad is once again keeping time\nSTEPHEN BALL\nNEWS REPORTER\nBlackett Laboratory Photo: Christian Richters\nthe number of correct answers to\nthat question it\u2019s clear that many\nstudents worked out the error in the\nformatting and inferred the correct\nanswer!\n\u201cIf the question was cancelled they\nmight be aggrieved that their hard\nwork was not rewarded. For this\nreason I decided to leave things as\nthey were.\u201d\nWarren pointed out that the\nquestion was worth 0.1% of a single\nsecond year module, but decided to\ndrop it after students commented\non the initial decision to ignore the\nerror completely. \u201cOn reflection I am\nhappy to agree that this is probably a\nlittle bit fairer overall, although the\nsmart students who worked out the\nerror probably would not agree.\n\u201cIn any case I am grateful to the\nstudent who found the problem,\nand to those who questioned the\nsolution.\u201d\nand the clock started working\ncorrectly that afternoon.\nThe system is designed to cope\nwith power outages by recording\nwhat positions the hands are in\nwhen power fails and then moving\nthem to the correct time when power\nis restored. This was put into use\nwithin a day of the new system being\ninstalled, when the Union suffered a\npower outage during the Superbowl\non Sunday evening.\nSince the system is based on the\nradio broadcast time, the clock will\nautomatically update itself when the\nclocks change meaning that very little\nhuman input will be needed to keep\nthe clock showing the right time.\nThe group would like to thank\nAli Lown and Dramsoc for their\nassistance in accessing the clock-face.\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\n\n"

The\nwork of an artist cannot\nbe separated from the social and\npolitical context in which it is\nformed, no matter how inoffensive it\nseems, and this lesson is exemplified\nby the British Museum\u2019s latest\nexhibition. Bonaparte and the British\n\u2013 which should already give you an\nidea of the strained relationships\nfound within \u2013 looks at the power of\nimages during the Napoleonic wars,\nspecifically those created by British\nsatirists.\nWith artists like Steve Bell working\ntoday, and Charlie Hebdo remaining\nin the headlines, it is easy to forget\nthat the true Golden Age of British\nsatire was during the turn of the 19th\nCentury, when cartoonists such as\nGeorge Cruikshank and James Gillray\ntook aim at every social institution\nexisting at the time, British or\notherwise. Napoleon is shrunk down\nto Little Boney by Cruikshank in a\nliteral belittlement; he is made to\neat dried beans, and blow the French\narmy across the Channel with his\nflatus; and he is transfigured into a\nhorrific monster, threatening the\nfoundations of Great Britain.\nBut not all the works are negative;\nthe British Museum has also made\nthe shrewd choice to include portraits\nof Napoleon himself, not all of which\nare accurate. Most of them show\nthe general as some form of heroic\nGrecian emperor, with mandatory\nchiseled jawline and strong brow;\nwhile I am sure that Napoleon wasn\u2019t\nhorrifically unattractive, these prints\nmake it clear that sometimes winning\nover hearts and minds is all about\nlooking hella fine, something that\nNapoleon knew and took advantage\nof, distributing his prints across\nEurope. For those wondering what\nthe relevance of such a message is\ntoday, all you need to do is look at\nsomeone like Ed Miliband to see how\nimage still rules the voters.\nThe explanatory captions are\nexcellent, explaining precisely what\nis going on in each cartoon, which\nis useful when one considers the\nsheer level of detail included; each\nsheet is a masterpiece in miniature,\nwith double-entendres and literary\nreferences built up layer upon layer.\nThey are also great at giving us the\nhistorical context, which may be\nnecessary for those not up to scratch\nwith their Napoleonic history (guilty\nDogugaeshi: Playful Puppetry without a Punch\nGold Foxes in Basil Twist's Dogugaeshi Photo: Richard Termine\nFred Fyles finds out all about Japanese puppetry at the Barbican Centre\n\"Rather\nthan a play\nas such,\nDogugaeshi\nis more of a\nperformance\"\nPuppetry is a dying art. It may\nnot attract the same kind of\nthink-pieces that occur when\nwe fear that e-books may replace the\ncomforting rustle of pages, or when\nsmall theatre companies are snuffed\nout one-by-one due to lack of funds,\nbut the fate facing the puppeteer is\nno less uncertain. Dogugaeshi at the\nBarbican Centre makes us aware of\nboth how far the art form has slipped\nfrom popular opinion, and displays\nthe work of a puppeteer who has \u2013 to\nthe extent that puppeteers can \u2013 made\nit big.\nThe work of \u2018third-generation\u2019\npuppeteer Basil Twist, Dogugaeshi\ntakes its name from an ancient\nJapanese theatre tradition of using\na series of sliding screens to alter\nperspective. Don\u2019t bother googling\nit; pretty much limited to the small\nisland of Awaji, the tradition is little-known, even within Japan. As part of\nhis research Twist travelled to Awaji,\nwhere he did manage to find a group\nof women who had seen a Dogugaeshi\nshow back in the 1950s, but more\noften than not simply discovered\nthe remains of this once-vibrant\ntradition: faded screens, tattered gilt\nwork, and repurposed stages.\nTwist has spoken of how the\npractice is closely related to his own\nwork, which often involves innovative\nuses of puppetry, incorporating\nflowing material, and non-human\nfigures. Having recently collaborated\nwith Kate Bush on her Before The\nDawn stage show (I didn\u2019t manage\nto get tickets; it\u2019s still a bit of a sore\nspot), Twist can now be regarded\nas somewhat famous. Perhaps not\nfamous in the traditional sense, but\nprobably as famous as puppeteers are\nlikely to get \u2013 after all, not everyone\ncan be Jim Henson.\nWithin Dogugaeshi, screens shift\nback and forth across the stage, flip\nround to reveal giant dragons, and\nfall from the ceiling as the mansion\ncentral to the plot begins to decay.\nRather than an actual play as such,\nwhat Twist presents us with is much\nmore of a performance: a series of\ntableaux, which slowly fade into one\nanother, blurring different scenes\ntogether. There is a sort of loose\nplot: or rather themes which recur\nthroughout the performance; ideas of\ntravel, decay, and revival all come up\nagain and again, as Twist reflects on\nthe very nature of Dogugaeshi as an\nart form.\nWhile presenting things in this\nway is obviously a stylistic choice, the\nlack of structure makes it difficult\nto understand what is going on, or\nindeed why we should care. The\naction is watched over by a mystical\nnine-tailed fox \u2013 the only apparition\nwhich could fit the traditional idea\nFRED FYLES\nARTS EDITOR\nof a \u2018puppet\u2019 \u2013 and Yumiko Tanaka, a\nmaster shamisen player, whose work\nincludes both traditional Japanese\ntradition, and more experimental\nfare. The atonal, haunting sound of\nher shamisen swirls around beating\ndrums, while her singing adds a\nnear-drone like element over the top.\nEnsconced in a beautifully severe\nkimono, and sitting poised at the\nedge of the stage, Tanaka\u2019s playing\nalone is worth the ticket price. Several\ntimes during the piece I found myself\nfocussing on her complex finger-work\nas opposed to the action occurring in\nthe centre.\nAnd therein lies the heart of\nDogugaeshi\u2019s problem: it simply\nisn\u2019t that engaging. While Twist\ndoes develop the genre of puppetry,\ninvolving projections, video, and\ncertain experiments with perspective\nwhich are admittedly extraordinary,\nthere are only so many times that I\ncan watch screens \u2013 exquisite though\nthey might be \u2013 being shuffled\nalong a stage. After the show, Twist\ntalked about how some elements of\nDogugaeshi evolved as a solution for\nscene changes, and this is reflected\nin the nature of the performance.\nWatching Dogugaeshi is like being\nconstantly on edge, anticipating the\nmoment when the actors will appear,\nand the action will finally start.\nDogugaeshi was on at the Barbican\nCentre as part of the London\nInternational Mime Festival, which takes\nplace every January.\n\"Yumiko\nTanaka's\nshamisen\nplaying is\nalone worth\nthe ticket\nprice\"\nas charged).\nWhat is fascinating about the\nexhibition is how it displays the\nchanging way Napoleon was\ndocumented in British culture; at the\nbeginning of the wars he is seen as\nnoble among the British republicans;\nwhen he flees from Egypt following\nhis defeat at the hands of Lord\nNelson, he is shown as a yellow-bellied coward; as a peace deal is\nbrokered, he begins to command\nrespect; but when war returns, he is\nruthlessly attacked, as he begins to\nstrike fear into the hearts of many\nBritish people. The curators have\nsaid that they \u201care not trying to\ntell the truth about Napoleon, but\nthe propaganda\u201d; at this they have\ncertainly succeeded, showing us the\npower, beauty, and genius of political\npropaganda.\nBonaparte & the British is on until 16th\nAugust.

The policy could also\npotentially cost the government\n\u00a32.5bn a year.\nIn order to cover the shortfall\nfrom the lowering the fees, Labour is\nconsidering asking higher-earning\ngraduates to pay bigger interest rates\non their loans and making them\ncontinue repayments for a period\neven if they settle their debt early.\nDuring the Prime Ministers\nQuestion Time last Wednesday,\nConservative MP David Willetts\nsaid that he welcomes the increase\nin students applying to University,\nespecially those from the poorest\nbackgrounds, before going to ask\nthe Prime Minister to confirm that\nlowering the fees would negatively\naffect both Universities and students\ninvidually.\nMr Willetts further went on\nto claim that Labour\u2019s policy of\nlowering fees would only help rich\ngraduates, questioning how such a\npolicy could be called progressive.\nThe Prime Minister answered that\nthe University funding system was\na long-term plan that has delivered,\nadding that Labour has no clue:\n\u201cWhen are you going to make up\nyour minds and set a policy.\u201d\nEd Milliband has repeatedly\nmentioned his intention to lower\ntuition fees but has yet to issue a\n\u201cmanifesto\u201d pledge.\nThe Business, Innovation and\nSkills (BIS) Committee called for an\nurgent review of the system, saying\nthe Chancellor\u2019s removal of the cap\non student numbers may result in a\nmulti-billion pound budget gap.\nThe commission forecasted that\nfor every \u00a31 the government lends\nout in student loans it loses 45p. The\nloss in the previous system was only\n28p.\n\u201cWith the prospect of a large\npotential black hole in the\ngovernment\u2019s budget figures, it\nis all the more alarming that the\nGovernment has refused to conduct\na review of the current student loan\nsystem,\u201d said Adrian Bailey MP,\nUniversities dismiss Miliband\u2019s Tuition Fee Policy\nPHILIP KURUKGY\nNEWS REPORTER\nCounter Terrorism bill\nBaroness Manningham-Buller also\nvoiced concerns on the bill, during\na debate in the House of Lords last\nweek.\nSaid Manningham-Buller: \u201cThere is\na profound irony in seeking to protect\nour values against this pernicious\nideology we are trying to bar views\ntoo vaguely described as non-violent\nextremism, which falls short of\nincitement to violence or to racial or\nethnic hatred or the other legislative\nconstraints on Universities.\u201d\nThe bill was introduced by Theresa\nMay, the Secretary of State for\nthe Home Department, back in\nNovember, and has rapidly moved\nthrough the House of Commons and\nthe House of Lords. Mrs May said\nof the bill during its second reading:\n\u201cToday\u2026the threat from terrorism\nis becoming ever-more complex and\ndiverse.\u201d\nMay hopes that with \u201ccross party\nsupport\u201d that it can be fast-tracked\nthrough Parliament before the\ngeneral election next May, and hopes\nit will combat any threat from people\njoining the Islamic State in the UK,\nalongside combating other terrorist\norganisations too.\nOn Wednesday, the House of Lords\nagreed to include a Home Office\namendment in the counter terrorism\nbill that states that colleges should\nstill consider free speech when\ncomplying with other elements of the\nbill.\nThese approaches were introduced\npost 9/11 as part of the government\u2019s\ncounter-terrorism strategy, known\nas CONTEST. CONTEST included\nstrategies for Preparing for an attack,\nProtecting the public, Pursuing\nattackers, and also Preventing\nradicalisation: known as the\nsophisticated sounding \u201cFour P\u2019s.\u201d\nThe Prevent strategy remains\ndeeply controversial despite the\nmillions of pounds invested into it by\nthe government. Initially there was\ndivision in what this should actually\nentail, but after 2005 and the 7/7\nbombings, \u00a380 million was spent\non 1,000 schemes across 94 local\nauthorities.\nThese schemes included paying\nto free speech in universities\nfor more CCTV cameras in areas\nwith a high percentage of Muslim\ninhabitants, which caused uproar.\nThey also include introducing\ncommunity Prevent Officers, that\nliaise with institutions and are known\nto ask about any \u201cissues\u201d student\nunions may be having with their\nrespective Islamic Societies.\nThe Prevent strategy was launched\nin 2007, but was re-launched in 2011\nto refocus on University activity,\nafter the \u201cunderwear bomber\u201d Umar\nFarouk Abdulmutallab, was known\nto have been studying at UCL. He\nconfessed and was convicted of\nattempting to detonate explosives\nhidden in his underwear whilst flying\nover from Amsterdam to Detroit.\nChair of the BIS Committee. Adding\nthat: \u201cthe Government apparently\nbelieves it could hike up the interest\nrate of their loans without this\nconstituting a change in the \u2018T&Cs\u2019.\u201d\nSomething that is a majorn concern\nto all students with outstanding\nloans and anyone consdering\napplying to University.\nThe government, which has cut\nteaching grants to Universities as\npart of the austerity program, argues\nthat higher tuition fees are needed to\nmaintain standards.\nWhile student loans, maintenance\ngrants and University bursaries\nare in place to ensure a wide\nparticipation from students from\npoorer backgrounds, often students\nwill rack up debts on average\n\u00a343,500 in debts by the time they\ngraduate.\nImperial College Union recently\nupdated their policy on higher\neducation funding, and decided to\nlobby the government to stop an\nincrease to tuition fees.\nAlex Savell, Deputy President\n(Finance and Services), gave his\nthoughts on the proposal: \u201cWhile\nin principle the Union applauds any\nstep to reduce tuition fees, if the\n\u00a36000 cap comes with no increased\nstate funding or an additional tax on\nhigh earning graduates then it is not\na step towards the ideals we support\nin spite of appearances.\n\u201cSlipping in a Graduate Tax\nvia the back door in particular is\nneither transparent, nor fair and it\nis not what Imperial College Union\nbelieves is right for it\u2019s students.\n\u201cWe have a clear objective and\ndemand: Reverse the decision to\nraise Tuition Fees to \u00a39000 without\nreducing the commitment to\nWidening Participation by a single\npenny.\u201d\nOne of the signs used by protesters who are against the bill Photo: DM\n\n"

This behaviour originated\nindependently at several locations\nand spread globally.\nIn the last 50 years, following the\n\u201cgreen revolution\u201d, we have seen\nthe intensification of agricultural\npractice become increasingly more\nextreme. Running parallel with this\nis the heightened pressure agriculture\nplaces on the environment. The\nAnthropocene epoch is defined as\nthe period whereby humankind\nbegan to significantly impact the\nEarth\u2019s ecosystems. Tapping into the\nEarth\u2019s energy supplies by extracting\nresources; specifically oil, coal and\ngas, marked the beginning of this\nnew geological era.\nThese resources, which we are now\ntotally dependent on, have provided\nus with comforts no previous human\ngeneration has experienced such as\nthe surplus supply of food in some\nregions. This could have perhaps\naided the expansions of human\npopulations by almost three times\nits original size 60 years ago. These\nare, however, short term amenities,\nand the provisioning cannot be\nsustained based on our current\nmethods.\nFields running dry\nWe strive for continual economic\ngain thus bad harvests must be\nprevented. Infertile land has\nbecome a distant memory in\nmost industrialised countries.\nIrrigation has allowed expansion\nof agricultural land in arid deserts.\nFossil water supplies found in\nthe ground deep below these\ndeserts have been overused for\nirrigation, transforming these\ndeserts into arable land. Plots\nhave been abandoned as the\nresource is depleted. Saudi Arabia\nis estimated to have depleted more\nthan 80% of the original 500 cubic\nkilometres of fossil water present.\nTransformations of deserts to\nfarmland in Israel has depleted\nwater supplies from the River\nJordan, causing the level of the Dead\nSea to drop by over one metre per\nyear. These are only a few examples\nbut unfortunately they do not\nrepresent exceptions. Agriculture\naccounts for at least 70% of human\nwater consumption.\nPesticide overuse\nThe Anthropocene marks a heavy\ndependence on the utilisation of\npetrochemicals in agriculture.\nPetrochemical manufacture\nis extremely energy intensive;\n1.2% of the world\u2019s energy is\nused to produce fertilisers alone.\nExpansions of monocultures have\nprovoked surges in pest populations.\nThe use of pesticides has had\nundesirable impacts on many\nuntargeted organisms. For example\norganochlorides such as DDT\n(dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane)\ncaused crashes in bird populations\nsuch as the Peregrine falcon,\nTurtle Dove and Yellow Wagtail.\nFrom 1980-2009, 297 million\nbirds were killed due to the use of\norganochlorides.\nHoney bees, our natural\npollinators, are seeing rapid\npopulation decline and pesticide\noveruse has been attributed as a\ncause of this decline. How can yield\nbe improved or even sustained\nwith the reduction of pollination\ninherent in the decline in bee\npopulations? Are these pesticides\nharmful to us humans? Despite the\nlack of knowledge of the future and\nexisting implications of current\nagricultural practice, we carry on\nregardless.\nFertilisers\nFertilisers are another child of the\npetrochemical revolution. Used to\nforce soils into fertility granting\nus the opportunity to meet global\nfood demand, they have also caused\nthe global environmental nitrogen\nsupply to double since in the last 50\nyears. The emission of nitrogen due\nto excessive fertiliser use causes air\nand water pollution. N2\nO makes up\n54% of the greenhouse gas emissions\nfrom the agricultural sector in the\nUK.\nThe potential of this gas to\ninduce global warming is 298 times\ngreater than that of carbon dioxide.\nFurthermore, fertilisers seep into\nnatural aquatic systems and cause\nblooms of algae and Cyanobacteria\nthat suck out oxygen from these\nsystems, depleting the oxygen\nsource resulting in the deaths of\nother respiring organisms. The\nresult is widespread ecosystem\ndamage.\nVegetarianism: the way\nforward?\nThe extraction of the natural\nresources in the Anthropocene\nepoch has allowed machines to\nreplace men. A single machine\nrunning on one litre of oil can\nparallel the work done by 50 humans\nin 24 hours. In the United States,\n\u201cInfertile\nland has\nbecome\na distant\nmemory.\u201d\nJane Courtnell on the woes of unsustainable agriculture\nYou are what you eat \u2013 but where\ndoes it come from?\nIt\u2019s not all golden sunshine and blue skies. The sun is beginning to set on intensive agriculture as we know it. Photo credit: photopics.org\n\n"

It is on\nthe front line of contemporary\nart and this means that, although all\nshows aren\u2019t guaranteed to thrill (such\nis the risk of pushing boundaries!),\nyou will have an exciting time no\nmatter what \u2014 much better this than\nthe rather soulless blockbuster shows\nof the Tate.\nAnd so I am greeted by Viviane\nSassen\u2019s latest exhibition Pikin\nSlee. A true innovator in fashion\nphotography, Sassen abstracts her\nwork to create pieces that transcend\nall notion of orthodoxy. We last\nsaw her at The Photographer\u2019s\nGallery, her exhibition Analemma,\nwhich explored her work in art\nfashion photography. But her current\nexhibition at the ICA represented a\nvery different body of her work.\nIn 2013, Sassen travelled to\nSuriname, deep into the jungle to a\ntown where the only outside contact\nwas via canoe \u2014 Pikin Slee. Here, she\ndocuments a world completely alien\nto her own, the life of the Saramacca\npeople, a traditional way of life where\nthe beauty of nature reigns supreme.\nIt is not a particularly large\ncollection of works; the ICA is not\na particularly large venue; but the\nexhibition manages to display many\naspects of the beauty of this little\ntown. From portraits and documents\nof the mundane to more abstract\npieces, such as the incredible Warrior,\nan anthropomorphic arrangement\nof palm fronds that trick the eye into\nseeing something that does not exist.\nThese are the Sassen works that\nI love, the ones that completely\nreinvent what one might expect\nto perceive, whether in fashion\nphotography or in nature. And\nI do not mind her liberal use of\nPhotoshop. She creates a modernity\nand dynamism in images that would\notherwise pass me by.\nHowever, this body of work only\nrepresents a small proportion of what\nis displayed. The rest I unfortunately\nfound less impressive. Yes it was well\nshot, well composed, but it didn\u2019t\nhave that unique Sassen signature\nthat you see written all over her\nfashion photography. Maybe it\u2019s just\nme who doesn\u2019t get it but photos of\nbuckets and puddles just don\u2019t do it\nfor me!\nWould I make a special point of\nseeing this display, probably not.\nAlthough it does have moments that\nare unlike any other depiction of\nrainforest communities I have seen,\nmuch of the rest is less fantastic.\nHowever, if you are going to the Dor\nGuez exhibition (read below, it was\nexcellent!), it may be worth popping\nyour head in. Otherwise, just stick to\nher fashion photography.\nfrom PTSD and undergo psychiatric\ntreatment.Drawing haunting\nparallels to his own life story,Guez\ndoes not lay blame on anyone,\nsimply weaving a tragic story that\nuses regular repetition to help show\nViviane Sassen, Warrior, 2013.

With the strongest\nlevel of competition from universities\nall over the country including a host\nof elite athletes who have represented\nEngland, Scotland and Great Britain\non an international stage this was\nundoubtedly billed to be the race of\nthe year.\nThe courses set for men\u2019s long, short\nand women\u2019s races were among the\ntoughest set in recent years, including\na gruelling ascent that would test all\nincluding the strongest athletes, the\ncourse had also been used the week\nbefore for the South of England XC\nchampionships, so it was already\nheavily worn.\nImperial had a strong team fielded\nfor both men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams.\nThe men\u2019s A-team included Spanish\ninternational Alberto Sanchez,\nBUCS 10km silver medallist Chris\nBannon, and fresher Chris Olley\nwho has had a storming season\nincluding a sub 32min 10km. They\nwere backed up by XC old timer Chris\nThomas, PhD student Mike Ridley,\nand triathlete David Freeman. In\nthe Women\u2019s team big things were\nexpected from 3:04 marathoner Sarah\nJohnson, international triathlete Imo\nSimmonds, and track specialist Alex\nMundell.\nThe men\u2019s A-race went out first at\nmidday, with the strongest 6 runners\nin each University heading out on\na 12km, 3-lap route. The front pack\nstayed together for the first 4km with\nBannon and Sanchez keeping close to\nthe front, and with Olley close behind\nall looking strong. Meanwhile behind\nChris Thomas was putting down the\nrace of his life holding his own in a\nstrong field.\nHalfway through the race a group\nof four comprising of GB athletes,\nJohnny Hay, Jonny Davies, Richard\nGoodman, and Callum Hawkins\nbroke free with a large surge that tore\nthe field to pieces. The last 6km was\ncovered at breakneck speed, with Hay\n(38:57) eventually winning by just\nover 20m from Davies (39:00).\nImperial were headed home by\nSanchez (39:55) in 7th place overall\nputting in a blistering finish to\npass Cambridge\u2019s first back. He was\nfollowed by Bannon (41:10) in 23rd,\nOlley (41:39) in 35th, and Thomas\n(44:06) in 90th to finish the scoring.\nFreeman (46:20) followed in 141st\nand Ridley (47:17) brought the\nA-team home in 167th.\nThis finish placed Imperial in 7th\noverall, gaining us valuable and hard\nwon BUCS points as a result of superb\nperformances, with Chris Thomas\nparticularly running the race of his\nlife under immense pressure, some\nsay his legs are still not working\nnearly a week later!\nIn the women\u2019s race it was a less\ntactical affair, with the front pack\ngoing for it from the start around the\nsteadily deteriorating course on their\nown 6km route. After a small pileup,\nwhen someone at the front of the\n500 strong field took a tumble, the\nrace was stretched out by last year\u2019s\nrunner up Emelia Gorecka who left\nno chance in the result this time to\nwin by nearly 100m.\nThanks to some brilliant training in\nrecent weeks, Sarah Johnson (25:24)\nwas first home for Imperial in 37th,\nImo Simmonds (25:48) following\nshortly after in 45th, Alex Mundell\n(26:08) finished the scoring coming\nback in 59th, no mean feat for\nsomeone more at home in an 800m\nrace! These three great finishes meant\nthe Women\u2019s Team placed 8th \u2013\nmeaning more BUCS points!!\nThere were a further 8 finishers for\nImperial including Kimberly Mason\n(29:27), Kara Meunier (32:24), Ophelie\nMeuriot (33:54), Anna Lawson (34:15),\nLily Battershill (34:45), Freya Espir\n(34:56) and Women\u2019s Captain Cloudy\nCarnegie (35:56).\nThey were spurred on by some\nexcellent cheering from the guys,\nand when they began their second\nlap were greeted a support team so\ndedicated, they had gone topless in\nthe cold to paint \u2018I M P E R I A L\u2019\non their chests! Perhaps distracted\nby such an impressive display,\nFreya managed to win the prize for\nmuddiest finisher after taking a\nmassive fall and losing her number!\nUp last was the men\u2019s B(anter) race,\nthe 8 km course was now a state being\njust a river of mud with the occasional\nbog, rock littered path, or near\nvertical descent to break the brown\nThe Imperial Women's Team.

The front of the\nrace was as always dominated by St.\nMary\u2019s and Birmingham running\ncyborgs who blasted their way round\nthe course seemingly unaffected by\nthe mud or now typically British\n\u2018character building\u2019 weather.\nImperial\u2019s men put in a strong\nshowing as ever with Simon Prigent\nleading the charge with French\nflair in 121st (30:55) he was closely\nfollowed by strong run by Joss Knight\nwho held on over the challenging\nSanchez chases down the competition on the finishing straight.

So these are the three events\nplanned for GIAG.\nB: You mentioned some other uni\nphilosophy societies?\nAb: We\u2019re starting up \u2013 the best way\nto gain strength is to collaborate\nwith other people. So far we\u2019ve been\nto the UCL philosophy society. They\nhad a talk recently, so the Chair and\nmyself went there, we invited their\nspeaker over to Imperial, so we have\nProfessor Schofield, who might join\nus next term, who\u2019s a utilitarian. So\njust to open avenues of collaboration,\ndo joint events with UCL, steal their\nspeakers, that sort of thing.\nThis Friday was Kings College\nLondon \u2013 they had a philosophy\nevent, so I went for that. It\u2019s the same\nthing, just to make ties with other\nuniversities. And they were quite\nenthusiastic \u2013 all these universities\nwere interested in doing a big event\nwith all the societies. So that would\ngive us strength.\nB: That\u2019d be exciting! What else\nhave you got on the horizon?\nAm: We want to start small, with pub\nevenings. So we\u2019ll also do casual, just\ngetting together, having drinks and\ntalking about philosophy.\nAb: Drinks and Debates! That\u2019s the\ncatchphrase we\u2019re using, anyway!\nAm: And afterwards, we\u2019ll have the\nspeaker series. It\u2019ll be interesting to\nhave the most exciting brains coming\nto Imperial to speak.\nAb: Speakers are interesting. So like\nAmelia said, we\u2019ll start small, we\u2019ll ask\nthe Horizons lecturer (who\u2019s a pretty\ndistinguished philosopher himself),\nand Professor Schofield has agreed\nto come and speak. We thought\nperhaps Philosophy of Science might\nbe something that Imperial students\nmight find more interesting than\nethics or politics, so we might start\nwith that.\nEventually, we are looking to get big\nspeakers. There\u2019s no point speculating\nnow, but I think that\u2019s the biggest\nthing we\u2019re dreaming for, to get\nsomeone like Noam Chomsky \u2013 that\u2019s\nour Chair\u2019s dream.\nB: Do you think there are\nphilosophers at Imperial?\nObviously, we\u2019re all scientists.\nAb: Well, science did used to be called\nnatural philosophy!\nAm: We think there are. Also if there\nare people who have, for example, an\nidea of God or not God, if you just\nhave meaning, you can come to the\nsociety, and we\u2019ll talk about it!\nAb: We have so many religious\nsocieties \u2013 that\u2019s an area of\n\u201cTo get\nsomeone\nlike Noam\nChomsky\n\u2013 that\u2019s\nour Chair\u2019s\ndream\u201d\nphilosophy.\nAm: Everybody has a philosophy,\neven if they don\u2019t know it, even\nscientists!\nB: Are you guys planning anything\nwith the religious societies?\nAb: We are. I mean, the goal right\nnow is to be at least a little bit\ncontroversial.\nB: It doesn\u2019t count if you don\u2019t\noffend someone?\nAb: The main thing is that... We have\na debating soc, public speaking soc, so\nwe need to distinguish ourselves by\nmaking the issue philosophical, not\npolitical or religious.\nBut free speech is not about what\nshould the government do \u2013 it\u2019s\nabout the philosophy behind it, the\nprinciples. Do we have certain rights?\nAre we born with certain rights?\nThose are the questions we\u2019re trying\nto answer.\nB: What\u2019s your membership\nlike? Are you mostly undergrads,\npostgrads, medics?\nAm: We want to have a mix, actually,\nso that everybody can come.\nB: I have a couple of fun questions.\nFirst one: stranded on a desert\nisland, and you can only take three\nthings with you.\nAb: Are we speaking as members\n\u201cEverybody\nhas a\nphilosophy\n... even\nscientists!\u201d\nof SocSoc, in which case I should\nsay Nietzsche, or would that be too\npretentious? I like to write, I\u2019d take a\nnotebook (and a pen, obviously).\nAm: Well, we can do the pen\nourselves, can\u2019t we?\nAb: What would you take?\nAm: So first, one friend. So that we\ncan discuss some things. The second\nwould be a notebook. Let\u2019s take a\nnotebook, a friend... and something\nto eat.\nAb: Isn\u2019t that all you need in life?\nAm: And a bottle of champagne!\nForget the food.\nB: And your favourite philosopher?\nYour personal one.\nAm: I really like Montaigne.\nAb: I love Nietzsche. I\u2019m just that\nkind of person, don\u2019t judge me. People\nburst into laughter when I mention\nNietzsche. I was at KCL, and they\u2019re\nvery against continental philosophy,\nfrom what I\u2019ve heard. I mentioned\nNietzsche and almost got kicked\nout... Nietzsche was controversial,\nbut you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to be\ncontroversial.\nB: Anything else you want to say?\nAb: I want to say that everyone should\njoin now while membership is free,\nbecause we are going to start changing\nfor it! Right now it\u2019s free and you\nshould join.\nB: Great, thanks guys!\nStarting a new club at Imperial\nImperial College Union boasts over\n340 societies,and that number\ngrows every month,with new\nsocieties proposed including Wine\nTasting,Airsoft and three different\napplications for weightlifting\nsocieties.\nThe creation of new clubs,\nsocieties and projects is run by\nthe New Activities Committee\n(NAC),a subcommittee of the\nClubs,Societies and Projects\nBoard (CSPB).This is chaired\nby the Deputy President (Clubs\n& Societies) (DPCS),and also\nincludes some of the experienced\nvolunteers holding roles in club\nmanagement.\nIf you have an idea for a new\nclub,the first step is to find other\npeople who are interested.You\nonly need three people to begin\nthe process (and only two for a\nproject).Once you\u2019ve got together,\nand decided who\u2019s going to be the\nPresident,Treasurer and Secretary\n(and any other r0les you want to\nhave) track down the form online\nand send it in to the DPCS.\nThings to think about when\nfilling out the form are how to make\nyour club sustainable, how to get\npeople to your events,and ways of\nfunding what you want to do.\nOnce they\u2019ve seen the application,\nthe NAC will decide whether to\nmake you a new club or put you into\nthe New Clubs Incubator\u2013which\nallows you to run activities with a bit\nmore support from the DPCS.Once\nyou\u2019ve run a few events and become\nsustainable,the NAC can make you\ninto a new club,and assign the club\nto one of Imperial\u2019s Management\nGroups.\nBEN HOWITT\nC&S EDITOR\nPhoto: Thomas Lim.

With half\nthe audience on one side and half on\nthe other, two different plays are on\nshow. In what feels like a set botched\ntogether from bits and pieces, the\naudience wait to find out which of\ntonight\u2019s two performances they\nwill see. Into the space walk the four\nactors; one sits down in front of us\nand the other three pass through the\nsmall opening to the other half of\nthe audience. Although we can hear\nwhat is going on on the other side,\ntheir actions can only be left to the\nimagination.\nThe Eradication of Schizophrenia\nin Western Lapland falls somewhere\nin the realms of what can only\nbe considered the extreme of\nexperimental theatre. An exploration\nof the nature of psychosis, this\nincredibly powerful, thought\nprovoking and deeply uncomfortable\nplay is unlike anything I have seen\nbefore. On one side of the dividing\nwall we find scenes from a mother\u2019s\nkitchen, and on the other, the\ndiscussions held in a therapist\u2019s\noffice. Inspired by the open dialogue\nmethod which has almost eradicated\nschizophrenia in Finland, the play\nprobes the uncertainty and confusion\nof the audience to highlight the\ndifferent perceptions of madness and\nthe importance of family in tackling\nmental illness.\nPerformed by the Ridiculusmus\nCompany, known for their work\nwhich bridges both the serious and\nfunny, this play is branded as a\nblack comedy. Would I call it that?\nAbsolutely not; but it says something\nabout this company that when faced\nwith such a challenging subject\nmatter, a need for humour is not a\nside thought but a necessity.\nThe performances in both halves\nof the room start simultaneously.\nAlthough separated in time and\nspace, the small passage through\nthe partition allows for a transition\nof actors from one performance to\nthe other. However, in changing\nperformance, the characters\nthemselves don\u2019t change. The result is\nan audience overwhelmed by barrages\nof conflicting information about each\nof the characters.\nWhat appears to be the archetypal\nrelationship between therapist and\npatient twists and turns, leaving the\naudience questioning themselves\nand their perceptions as much as\nthe characters on show. Added to\noverheard fragments from across the\npartition, the line between reality\nand delusion becomes increasingly\nblurred. Moments of egomania and\nsubtle madness are contrasted against\nlines referring to the here and now.\nDialogue describing the patient\nhaving written the works of Nabokov\nswerves wildly into discussions of\nhow he was born from the F\u00fchrer\u2019s\nfrozen sperm! The therapist reminds\nhim of the treatment he is obliged\nto offer, Clozapine, before we are\nreminded of why we are here.\n\u201cMy colleague and I worked on a\ntraining programme which almost\neradicated Schizophrenia in\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWestern Lapland. I know, it\u2019s the\nname of the play we are in.\u201d\nThrough the psychosis on show, the\naudience are suddenly and brutally\naware of what has been happening. It\nis not an illness to display psychosis\nbut rather the fear of outsiders who\nlabel the strange experiences of\nothers. This we call schizophrenia,\nand throughout the first half the\naudience dissect every character\u2019s\nactions, deciding who to label sane\nand who to label insane.\nSo, it was in the context of this\nextraordinary first half that the\ninterval arrived, and for the first time\nin my experience, no one moved.\nBewildered and confused, even\nthe house lights coming up saw no\nreaction from the audience. If any of\nthe audience had ever wondered what\nit\u2019s like to be really star struck, this\nwas it. Only when the usher returned\nThe Eradication of Schizophrenia in Western Lapland. Photo: Richard Davenport\nMax Falkenberg delves into on-stage psychosis at the BAC\n\"If anyone\nhad ever\nwondered\nwhat it's\nlike to be\nreally star\nstruck, this\nwas it.\"\n\"This\nincredibly\npowerful,\nthought\nprovoking\nplay is\nunlike\nanything I\nhave seen\nbefore.\"\nto the auditorium to remind us that\nwe could get up did anyone start to\ntake notice.\nOn comes the second half and the\nushers instruct us to enter the other\nhalf of the auditorium. We are now\nseated in front of the mother in her\nkitchen and the patient\u2019s brother.\nThroughout the first half, the\nmother had been painted as a\nmadwoman. With the tone and\nvolume of the actors perfected so that\nonly very particular lines could be\nheard, the patient\u2019s descriptions of\nhis mother\u2019s borderline personality\ndisorder are only reinforced by the\nnoises and silhouettes from beyond\nthe partition.\nNow in the second half, the show\nrestarts the dialogue where it had\nbeen twenty minutes into the first\nhalf. What seemed like madness\nwhen they could only be heard is\nnow clarified through the details not\nvisible to the other side. The image\nof the family comes across as deeply\ndysfunctional, but the mother still\ncomes across as sane and loving where\npreviously she appeared to be neither.\nIt is here that we are reminded for\nthe second time of the words of the\npatient: \u201cThe fictional realm helps\nyou unearth your problems.\u201d As\nthe show progresses, the audience\u2019s\nconfusion and unease has left them\ndesperately trying to solve what is\ngoing on in the characters\u2019 heads.\nHowever, in doing so, assumptions\nhave been made and stereotypes\nhave been grasped at which leave the\npatient powerless. In the show\u2019s final\nmoments, the partition is opened and\na moment of family unity reminds\nus of what is really important; the\nsupport and love of the people around\nyou, and an acceptance of uncertainty\nwhen tackling Schizophrenia.\nThe Eradication of Schizophrenia\nin Western Lapland might not be\na classical masterpiece, but it is\nextraordinary in its own right. Did I\nenjoy the performance? No, but what\nit lacked in simple enjoyment it made\nup for in the way I was left speechless\nat the end. If you\u2019re really the sort of\nperson who wants a fun, entertaining\nevening out, avoid this show like\nthe plague, but its exploration of\nthe human psyche is unmatched by\nanything I have seen in recent years.\nAll I can do is stand and cheer at the\nincredible work of Ridiculusmus.\nWe might not have given the cast a\nstanding ovation on the night, but\nwhen you\u2019ve had your legs swept out\nfrom underneath you, a star struck\nround of applause will do.\nThe Eradication of Schizophrenia in\nWestern Lapland is at the Battersea Arts\nCentre until 14th\nFebruary.

An early widower, he\ntravelled Europe to offer his services\nto his many royal patrons, leaving\nbehind an exceptionally prolific and\nversatile body of work. Crucially,\nthis unanimously acclaimed\nheritage scattered around Europe\nwas available to serve as model for\nthe formation of next generations\nof artists. Moreover, many of his\nmasterpieces were engraved and\nlargely diffused throughout the\nknown world. In the exhibition there\nis even a 17th\ncentury Chinese plate\ncopying one of Rubens\u2019 paintings!\nWhilst Rubens is best known for\nhis portraiture of fleshy nudes, this\nexhibition reveals the variety of the\nMaster\u2019s production and the codes\nhe invented; from composition to\ntheme, style to colour, Rubens\u2019 legacy\nhas unmatched resonance for artists,\neven to the present day.\nThe curators have therefore opted\nfor a thematic display: Poetry,\nElegance, Power, Lust, Compassion\nand Violence. Each of Rubens\u2019\npaintings are intuitively shown\nopposite his followers\u2019, stressing the\ntechnique laid down by the Master\nand picked up later. We start with\nhis own assistant Van Dyck and\nmove from Boucher and Watteau\nin 18th\ncentury; through Delacroix,\nConstable and Daumier in the 19th\ncentury; and to C\u00e9zanne and Picasso\nin the 20th.\nPoetry presents bucolic landscapes\nof Gainsborough, Constable and\nTurner and romances by Watteau.\nElegance displays portraits of the Elite\nby Van Dyck and Fragonard. Power\ncomprises sketches of monumental\nfrescos and ceilings by Thornhill.\nCompassion showcases religious\nworks by Delacroix. Violence exposes\nimpressive depictions of infernal\nscenes and dramatic confrontations\nof man and beast during hunts by\nDelacroix and Soutman. Finally,\nLust reveals nudes by many inspired\nsuccessors, including C\u00e9zanne and\nPicasso to name but a few.\nIn parallel with Rubens and His\nLegacy: Van Dyck to C\u00e9zanne, Royal\nAcademician Jenny Saville prepared\na response entitled La Peregrina.\nExhibited in one of the last rooms,\nthis display presents works by\nmodern artists such as Willem de\nKooning, Pablo Picasso, Francis\nBacon, and Sarah Lucas. Saville has\neven created a new work especially\nfor the occasion: Voice of the Shuttle\n(Philomela).\nLa Peregrina takes its name from\nan exceptional pearl depicted by\nRubens in his time that eventually\ncame to belong to Andy Warhol\u2019s\nmuse, Elizabeth Taylor. Although\nLa Peregrina never appeared in\nWarhol\u2019s work, Saville sees it as a\nbrilliant name for the display she has\nbrought together; unlike the obvious\nrelations between Rubens\u2019 and\nothers\u2019 paintings in the main exhibit,\nshe creates a dialogue with Rubens\nthrough the medium of modern\nart. The works on display have for\nSaville an inherent debt to Rubens in\nterms of composition and colour; the\nquasi-subliminal links she establishes\nconstitute indubitably a vibrant\nhomage to the Flemish Master.\nThroughout the rooms, it is striking\nto discover the legacy left by Rubens\nto art in general, and even more\nfascinating to realize the breadth\nof his work. Indeed, most of the\nbrilliant successors who claimed to\nhave been influenced by Rubens were\nspecialized in very different themes,\nin fact all six aforementioned. It\nseems that we can conclude the\nexhibition is a success, meeting\nperfectly its goal of demonstrating\nRubens\u2019 influence on prominent\nartists who came long after him.\nRubens and His Legacy: Van Dyck to\nC\u00e9zanne is at the Royal Academy of Arts\nuntil April 10th.\nTickets \u00a315, concessions\navailable\n\"Rubens'\nlegacy has\nunmatched\nresonance\nfor artists,\neven to the\npresent\nday.\"\n\n"

So is it\nany wonder that we\u2019ve known for a\nlong time now that sleep, memory\nand learning are deeply connected?\nPrevious studies have shown that\nwhen animals such as mice \u2013 and\neven humans! \u2013 are sleep deprived,\nthey tend to experience a lapse in\ntheir memory.\nMore recent research has shed\nlight on the fact that sleep is critical\nin converting short-term memories\nto long-term memories, a process\nknown as memory consolidation.\nHowever, we are as yet unsure of the\ndetails of how this works.\nAre memories reinforced because\nduring sleep, our brain has more\ntime to \u2018replay\u2019 all the events of the\nday and filter out the unwanted\nmemories from the wanted ones, or\nare \u2018memory neurons\u2019 in the brain\nthe reason why we feel sleepy in the\nfirst place?\nPaula Haynes and Bethany\nChristmann, of Brandeis University,\nled a project that studied well-known\nmemory consolidator neurones in the\nfruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,\ncalled dorsal paired medial (DPM)\nneurons and examined how these\ninteracted with wakefulness-promoting neurones, called\nmushroom body (MB) neurons. The\nmushroom body is a section in the\nDrosophila brain where memories\nare stored.\nInterestingly, they found that\nwhen the DPM neurons were\nactivated, they released an inhibitory\nneurotransmitter called GABA which\ndecreased the activity of the MB\nneurons, making the flies sleep more.\nWhen this system was deactivated\nby downregulating two of the MB\nneurons\u2019 receptor subtypes (the\nGABAA\nand GABAB\nR3), there was\nincreased loss of sleep in the flies.\nThis intimate regulation of\nsleep by neurons necessary for\nmemory consolidation suggests\nthat these brain processes may be\nfunctionally interrelated through\ntheir shared anatomy. These memory\nconsolidation neurons inhibited\nthe drive for wakefulness as the\nconversion of short-term to long-term memory commenced.\nBethany Christmann, co-author\nof the study which was published\nin the journal eLife, explained that\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if that section of the\nmushroom body were [initially]\nsaying \u2018hey, stay awake and learn\nthis\u2019 ... then, after a while, the DPM\nneurons start signalling to suppress\nthat section, as if to say \u2018you\u2019re going\nto need sleep if you want to remember\nthis later\u2019\u201d.\nThese findings have important\nSleep and memory are intimately linked Photo: Flickr\nimplications for understanding\nthe relationship between sleep\nand memory consolidation, by\nsupporting the role played by\ninhibitory neurotransmission in the\nregulation of these processes. Further\ndevelopment of our understanding\nof the relationship between sleep\nand memory in a simple system such\nas the fruit fly may hopefully take\nus a step closer to unravelling the\ncomplex mechanisms behind sleep\nand memory in the human brain.\nChristmann also mentioned how this\nresearch could \u201chelp us figure out\nhow sleep or memory is affected when\nthings go wrong, as in the case of\ninsomnia or memory disorders\u201d.\nIn the meantime, if you want to ace\nthat paper tomorrow, put down that\ncan of Red Bull and hit the sack!\nDOI: 10.7554/eLife.03868.001\nUTSAV RADIA\nSCIENCE WRITER\n\n"

    "content": "30 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.02.2015\n30 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\nHANGMAN hangman@imperial.ac.uk\nGraduates remain unemployed due to commenting on stories\nonline four years ago\nAfter several requests this week\nto remove material left by\nthe students of yesteryear\non our website, Hangman decided\nto investigate just what effect these\ncomments may have had on their\nfuture employment chances.\nWith several alumni and older\nstudents asking for their work to be\nmade anonymous, or for comments\nattributed to their name to be\nremoved, Hangman decided to really\nfind out if employers do indeed give\na shit about what you get up to on the\ninternet.\nWe spoke to one employer of a\nlarge, faceless corporation that either\nconsults on or sells products, about\nthe hundreds of recruits they take on\neach year. One line manager told us\nthat they had indeed seen a comment\nleft four years previously on a dry,\nmistake-riddled article about the\ngaming industry. The comment\ncalled the author a \u201cTosser lol.\u201d\nThe line manager confirmed that\nthe candidate, now a postgraduate\nand in possession of two degrees,\nthree summers\u2019 worth of internship\nexperience and the ability to code\ncomputers whilst blindfolded,\nwasn\u2019t considered as a result of the\ncomment. Said the manager: \u201cYeah,\nwe interviewed the postgraduate and\neverything, and they made it into the\nfinal two.\n\u201cThe other candidate had\nfortunately never even owned a\ntwitter account, let alone commented\nsuch mundane insults on a University\nwebsite, so we decided to hire them\ninstead.\u201d\nAnother employer, who runs a\nlarge pharmaceutical company, also\nsaid they had googled their final\ntwo candidates for their well-paid\ngrad scheme. They confirmed they\nhad read an article written by one\nImperial graduate about the Green\nParty, written around three years ago,\nwho had also made it into the final\nstage of recruitment.\nSaid the employer: \u201cIt was a tough\none. The article wasn\u2019t particularly\nopinionated, and, to be honest,\nalthough the grammar and spelling\nwas fine it didn\u2019t really actually\nmake a definitive point, which can\nbe expected of a comment piece in a\nstudent newspaper.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, the other candidate,\nalthough lacking any laboratory\nabilities and also because they were\nilliterate had never, ever, voiced\nany opinion on any online medium\never, so he just seemed like the safer\nchoice.\u201d\nFinally, Hangman spoke to a\nrecruitment agency that recruits\npeople to then recruit other people\nfor other jobs, about those they had\nplanned to recruit in the first place.\nAgain, the recruiter said, it had\ncome down to two candidates,\none from Imperial who had once\ncommented on an article two\nStudents remain confused over newspapers\nallegiance with the school of medicine\nStudents remain confused over\nnewspapers allegiance with the\nschool of medicine\nStudents and staff alike were left\nconfused and dazed after reading\nlast week\u2019s issue of Felix, covering an\nindependent survey ran to find the\ncost of living for final year medical\nstudents.\nThe article went into detail about\nthe reduction in funding those in\nfinal year can expect, and also how a\njam-packed timetable means many\ncan\u2019t work part time jobs too.\nHowever, the article was printed\nonly days after another piece covering\na medic sports team smashing a coach\nwindow and being suspended.\nAs a result, many readers were\nunable to come to a conclusion as to\nwhether or not the paper loved or\nhated medical students, or, because\nthe later article didn\u2019t highlight\nthe strains of students who are not\nmedics, whether or not the paper\nhated all students equally anyway.\nOne student, reading the paper in\nthe library caf\u00e9 as tuna mayo dripped\ndown his chin, spoke to Hangman\nabout his confusion. \u201cI just don\u2019t get\nit, why would a paper print articles\nthat are simply at odds in what they\nare saying?\n\u201cLike, they say in the Coachgate\nVersion 2.0 article that all medical\nstudents are absolute vile pigs that\ncan\u2019t be trusted to be within two feet\nof a vehicle.\u201d\n\u201cBut then, they say in the other\npiece that medics are poor little\nstruggling souls that deserve\nsympathy.\u201d\n\u201cHm, I think Felix must simply flip\na coin, and use that to decide whether\nor not to bully or worship medical\nstudents in that week\u2019s issue.\u201d\nWhen Hangman pointed out that\nthe pieces were just news articles, and\ndidn\u2019t really say any of the above, the\nstudent swallowed his soggy jacket\npotato bite and thought for a second.\nHe continued: \u201cYeah, but like, it\u2019s a\nyears previously, and one who was\ncurrently in a coma after being hit by\na bus.\nThe article, although slightly\ncontroversial but attributed to\nanother student author, came up too\nwhen searching the candidates name,\nalthough the comment they had left\nhad simply read: \u201cI neither agree or\ndisagree with this sentiment, but will\nregister my interest into this piece\nby simply commenting using my full\nstudent newspaper isn\u2019t it? It should\nreally focus on reporting on students\ndoing good and stuff, you know, for\nmost of content. \u201d\nA senior member of the faculty of\nmedicine, sitting in SAF on the sofas\nunder the stairs, was more resolute.\n\u201cThat article about them broken\nwindows and stuff was terrible. Why\nwould Felix report on that? It\u2019s just\ngiving us a bad name.\n\u201cAh well, it\u2019s a fucking rag anyway,\nand no-one reads it.\u201d\nHangman pointed out that maybe\nthe bad behaviour by the small group\nof students was what contributed\nto any sort of poor reputation.\nHangman also suggested that student\nreadership would recognise that\nnot all medics go around puking on\nseats or allegedly shaking children in\nbowling alleys.\nThe guy shrugged, and continued,\nwhilst waving his stethoscope in a\nhaphazard manner and chugging\ndown a snakebite despite it being 9am\nFelix: sponsored by the School of medicine.\nname.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we weren\u2019t sure,\u201d said\nthe recruiter, shaking his head.\n\u201cAlthough we like candidates with\na personality, outside interests,\nand, quite frankly, the absolute\nessential ability to know how to use\na computer, those that comment on\nwebsites just don\u2019t do it for us.\n\u201cI mean, obviously we could tell\nthe article wasn\u2019t written by the\ncandidate, but their name was on\nthe same page, and for us, that is a\ndeal breaker.\u201d The candidate who is\ncomatose took up the role instead,\nalthough is simply wheeled up to the\ncomputer table each day and stares\nlifelessly at the screen.\nThe recruiter shrugged, \u201cYeah, the\nother candidate basically can\u2019t do\nthe job at all, but how could be ever\npossibly hire a graduate who once\ndared to contribute to student media?\nWe could have been sued.\u201d\nFelix Online: the website at the centre of all the controversy\non a Tuesday morning.\n\u201cI just think that the paper should\nbe supporting the student body, so\nshouldn\u2019t actually bother with news,\nto be honest, unless it is about how\ngreat the School of Medicine.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough saying that, that jihad\norgy story was hilarious.\u201d\n\n"

The bill\naddresses a number of strategies to\npotentially stifle terrorism activity\nand influence, but seeks to make\na number of currently optional\napproaches for Universities\ncompulsory.\nThe bill proposes that the\nSecretary of State should also\nissue guidance to institutions\non how such duties should be\nfulfilled, and tell institutions\nwhat direct actions should be\ntaken. They can invoke action by\ncourt order if necessary.\nOne part of the bill, called\n\u201cPrevent\u201d, aims to place statutory\nduty on institutions such as\nUniversities to prevent students\nbeing drawn into terrorism,\n\u201cincluding non-violent extremism.\u201d\nActions suggested by Prevent that\nUniversities should take include\nintroducing strict policies and\nprocedures to manage campus events,\nincluding the booking of speakers.\nColleges or Unions should\nalso investigate the content of\npresentations before given to students\nif by external speakers, and monitor\nthe IT use of students. They should\nalso be able to limit what students\ncan access through their network, and\nintroduce policies to determine what\nsort of research should constitute\nconcern when browsing online.\nThe paper drafted against the bill\nfor Union Council, authored by\ntwo members of the Islamic Society\ncommittee, will be debated next\nTuesday. It states that the bill may\n\u201ccreate a culture where students are\nunwilling to speak out,\u201d and suggests\nthat academics should not have to spy\non students and their activities.\nThe paper proposes that the Union\nshould agree that: \u201cThat by risking\nthe ability of a scope of events taking\nplace from controversial speakers to\nstudent led events, the bill will simply\ndrive certain activities off campus\nwhere they are currently held and\nregulated and as such any radical\nelements will be allowed to flourish\nunchecked without oversight that is\nnow currently in place.\u201d\nIt also suggests that the\nUnion should agree that: \u201cThe\nimplementation of the Prevent\nstrategy on campus will not only\nisolate Muslim students but\nundermine the civil liberties of\nother groups such as environmental,\npolitical and humanitarian activists.\u201d\nAnother belief of the paper is that\nthe best way to counter extremism to\nsimply expose it through academic\ndiscussion.\nFelix spoke to the iSoc President,\nIbtesham Hossain, who said that the\nbill will have widespread implications\nfor all students, regardless of religion.\nHossain said: \u201cThe Counter Terrorism\nSecurity Bill is a dangerous legislation\nthat, ironically, is \u2018extremist\u2019 and\nthreatens core \u2018British values\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cIn trying to thwart the former and\npromote the latter, the government\u2019s\nblanket approach not only has serious\nimplications for freedom of speech\nand the ability to challenge and\ndebate ideas in a university setting,\nbut also creates a culture of suspicion\nbetween academics and students.\u201d\nCurrently, if student societies want\nto book a speaker, they must inform\nthe Union about the speaker: what\norganisations they are linked with\nand if there have been any difficulties\nor threats when they have spoken in\nthe past. Publicity for the speaker\nmust generally also be attached, and\nall of this must be provided to the\nUnion no less than three weeks prior\nto the event.\nThe speakers are also authorised by\nCollege security, and any potential\nrisks are flagged to authorities within\nthe College.\nFelix spoke to the current Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies), Abi\nde Bruin, who currently authorises\nexternal speakers at the Union level,\nshe told us: \u201cIn most situations we can\nwork to let these events take place.\nWe may have to put some precautions\nin place, such as additional security\nmeasures for high profile speakers,\nbut the vast majority are not a cause\nfor concern.\u201d\nThe government released the\noutlines for the new Prevent scheme\nback in December, and asked\ninstitutions to email their responses\nto their call for consultation. Some of\nthe officer trustees responded in one\ndocument, and College responded\nseparately and they have refused to\nrelease the document to Felix before\nthe print deadline.\nde Bruin said in the officer\ntrustee response that although\nthey \u201cbroadly agree\u201d with the\nconcept of the new Prevent scheme,\nbut have reservations about how\nvague some parts are, such as the\nlack of definitions for terms such\nas \u201cvulnerable individuals\u201d and\n\u201cfundamental British values\u201d that are\nreferred to throughout the scheme.\nThe Council paper highlights the\nvagueness of the bill, and criticises\nit as it puts Students\u2019 Unions at risk\nsince they are legally expected to\nmonitor events that are undefined.\nThe papers points out that the\nproposals will not help Unions in\ncontrolling extremist action, and\nwill instead cause events to be held\noutside the University environment\nwhere into forums where there is no\noversight.\nStudent Unions from School\nof Oriental and African Studies\n(SOAS), University College London,\nKings College London, Queen\nMary\u2019s University and London\nSchool of Economics have already\npassed motions condemning and\ndisassociating itself with the bill.\nThe National Union of Students\nalso denounced the bill as \u201cFurther\ndeveloping a culture of suspicion\nand surveillance on campuses,\nwhilst also potentially conflicting\nwith institutions\u2019 duties to promote\nfreedom of speech, by making them\noverly risk-averse and unwilling\nto engage in important topics of\ndiscussion.\u201d\nIn an open letter published by\nthe Guardian, over 500 professors\nfrom institutions across the country,\nincluding Imperial, have condemned\nthe bill as \u201cunnecessary and illconceived,\u201d stating that the bill is\ninflicting \u201cDraconian crackdowns\u201d in\na bid to tackle the extremism.\nLast week, Imperial\u2019s Chair of\nCollege Council, (the highest decision-making body of Imperial College\nLondon), and former head of M15,\nInfrographic: Measuring Anti Muslim Attacks about the latest counter terrorism bill, introduced by Theresa May (pictured) Photo: itellmamauk\nPhilippa Skett looks at the controversial bill that may be a threat\n\n"

I\u2019m calling\nit SocSoc, is that okay?\nAmelia: SocSoc\u2019s fine! So, we got an\nemail from India [Jordan, Student\nActivities Coordinator] and she just\nsaw that there was a philosophy\nsociety before, but it was no longer\nworking, and\u2026\nAbhinav: It was completely inactive.\nThere\u2019s no committee. I think the\nlast year, the committee consisted\nof one person. It exists out there, but\nthere was nothing in principle. So she\nemailed the members, because we had\nsigned up.\nAm: We signed up to something, we\ndidn\u2019t really know what it was...\nB: So, was this one of many\nFresher\u2019s Fair signups?\nAb: No, because they didn\u2019t have\nanything at Fresher\u2019s Fair. It was\njust the Union page that we found\ninteresting, so she was like \u201cwould\nyou like to start this?\u201d. And so we met,\nwe fixed our first meeting...\nAm: Four persons!\nAb: Yeah, there were four of us at the\nfirst meeting. We\u2019ve expanded now,\nto around eight, I think.\nAm: We\u2019ve doubled already! The\ncommittee, that is.\nB: Cool! So you said eight on\ncommittee; is that eight people\ninvolved overall?\nAb: I think we have around 60 or\n70 members. Probably a fraction\nof those would be from last year.\nAnd those who just joined, without\nknowing exactly what it is. And of\ncourse, now we\u2019ve got more people to\njoin.\nAm: So the interest is there.\nB: Which is always good!\nAb: On paper we have 70 members,\nanyway.\nB: Just so I\u2019ve got some perspective\non you guys, can you talk me\nthrough who you are on the\ncommittee, and why you\u2019re at\nImperial?\nAm: I\u2019m doing the masters at the\nbusiness school. And yeah, I wanted\nto join some societies, and so I looked\nat the societies, and philosophy\nwas something I did already in my\nundergraduate in Berlin, so I thought,\nthat would be perfect.\nAb: I\u2019m an undergrad doing physics\nwith theoretical physics. I\u2019ve never\nstudied philosophy, but always\nbeen interested. I\u2019m doing it for my\nHorizons.\nAnd our chair Jiayi, who couldn\u2019t\nbe here, she has also done it in\nundergrad, and since Imperial doesn\u2019t\nreally have any philosophy course,\nother than the Horizons one, we just\nthought, we should do something.\nYou asked about the committee?\nB: Yeah, just to have a perspective\non who everyone is.\nAb: It\u2019s interesting. Initially, the first\nmeeting, obviously we didn\u2019t know\neach other. So deciding the committee\nmembers who would be Chair,\nSecretary was quite difficult, because\nmore than one person wanted to be\nChair, no-one wanted to be secretary,\nso there was no point trying to be\ndemocratic and voting on it, because\nwe didn\u2019t know each other. So we\ndecided the most fair system would be\ntotally anarchic, put our names in a\nhat and that\u2019s exactly how we decided.\nThat\u2019s how I became Treasurer, that\u2019s\nhow she [Amelia] became Vice Chair,\nJiayi became Chair, and Samuel,\nwhat\u2019s your club activity like on a\ngeneral basis?\nAm: We\u2019re organising our plans, to\nset up the website, and then talk to\npeople, invite people. We think, for\nexample, if we have a speaker or a date\nwhere we do something together, then\neverybody will turn up. We are in\ndifferent departments, so we can ask\neverybody, and they will come.\nAb: On the speaker note, we\u2019ve sent\nambassadors to other universities\nto collaborate with the philosophy\nsocieties there, but the most\nimmediate events are the Give it\na Go events, which are coming up.\nObviously this is for new members\nto get a taste of what it\u2019s like, they\u2019ll\nbe free events. So we have booked a\nroom, we have planned events.\nB: When\u2019s this going to be?\nAb: This will be next Tuesday,\nThursday and the Tuesday after\nthat. So for the GIAG events, we\u2019re\nplanning open mic debates \u2013 so semi-structured debates, where we have one\nperson on either side. I\u2019ll just tell you\nabout the three events.\nSo the first one is going to be on\nfreedom of speech vs. right to offend,\nthe whole Charlie Hebdo thing;\nit\u2019s quite a topical issue. So we\u2019re\nthinking of opening... one of us would\nrepresent one side and opening up\nTwo different artists\u2019 impressions of the \u2018SocSoc\u2019 AGM. Photos: Left: Cleo Horton, Right: London International Youth Science Forum\nwho\u2019s our fourth committee member,\nbecame the Secretary.\nB: That\u2019s really cool!\nAb: Well, we thought it would be the\nphilosophical way to do it.\nB: And your committee names are\nodd as well, right? You don\u2019t just\nhave a Chair or Treasurer, you\ndecided to put names on them.\nAb: Yes, we have Socrates, and\nI\u2019m Marx, because I\u2019m Treasurer,\nobviously. That kind of thing!\nAm: We have Nietzsche, we have...\nYeah, everyone has a name.\nB: Would you say you run SocSoc\non a Marxist system?\nAb: That\u2019s an interesting question!\nAm: No, we don\u2019t!\nAb: No, no, of course not! How could\nyou accuse us of doing that?\nAm: It\u2019s a capitalist system, 100%.\nAb: It\u2019s a new society, we\u2019re all trying\nto figure out what to do.\nAm: And we want, actually, to find\nout who everybody is!\nAb: There is the danger of becoming\ncommunist, we must avoid that.\nB: Okay, so you\u2019ve got 60-70\nmembers now. What have you\nbeen doing to get new members in,\n\n"

Turns out Alex\nSavell wasn\u2019t a top of the pops\npresenter in the eighties.\nThis week everything actually\ngoes quite well: you don\u2019t\nfuck any hamsters; you don\u2019t\ncontract any STIs; you do quite\nwell in your essay; no libels\nare placed on your newspaper.\nHave a pint to help you forget\nthe crippling amount of debt\nyou\u2019re entering into and how\nstupid it was to come london.\u200b\nthisweekaftertheexcitement\nofsnowfallinginLondon,you\nrushoutofhallsinyourpyjamas\nonlytorealiseyouhaveleft\nwithoutyourIDcardinthesub\nzerotemperatures.Thisleadsto\nextremefrostbiteonyourpenis\nleadingtooneofthe5thyear\nmedicsdoinganemergency\namputationforextramoney.\nThisweekafterexhaustingTindr,\nyoudecidetousethejewish\nequivalent(J-swipe),labelling\nyourselfasultra-orthodoxto\nincreaseyourchancesandyou\nreceiveaninvitationforadate;\nhoweverwhenyougotomeet\nthemyoudiscoveritwasPhillipa\nSketttryingtotrapanyunwitting\nfreshers.\nThis week you after staying\nup to watch the Super Bowl,\nyou are forced to caffeinate\nyourself within an inch of your\nlife in order to make it to your\nlabs. You forget to realise that\nthere may be side effects. After\nan hour of heart palpitations,\nyou faint on the laboratory\nfloor, shitting yourself in front\nof that hot postgrad supervisor.\nThis week after an extremely\ndull lecture you decide to do\nthe Felix Sex Survey. After\ndetailing your preferences and\ncomplete lack of sex whilst\nat Imperial you accidentally\nfall asleep. Your friends find\nyour results and publish them\nto everyone. At least you can\nfinally come out as the emo-goat fetishist.\nThis week you go to Kris Kaye\u2019s\nracist apology speech following\nthe reveal of his nefarious club\nparticipation. He references\nthe fact that he has many black\nfriends and relations seem to\nbe repairing; however he ends\nhis talk with a parisian themed\nJay-Z song leading to a riot and\nthe eventual extradition of Kris\nKaye.

They\ninvite you back to Wilson\nHouse but unfortunately\nyou fail too take into account\nthe bus strike which leads\nto you have sex in the Ethos\nswimming pool. at least\nyou now have something\ninteresting to say on the Felix\nSex Survey.\nThis week we shall learn how\nto make fishcakes: Put the\nsalmon in a frying pan pour\nover enough milk to cover\nthe fish, lower heat to a gentle\nsimmer and leave to poach\nfor 4 mins. Then leave the\nfish to continue cooking for 5\nmins. Lift the salmon out onto\na plate, flaking it into large\npieces with a fork.\nFriday 30th January\nToday I went to the Union with my hall mates, and left my laundry in the washing machine.\nI know it is really bad to not wait around but it takes so long to do a wash, like nearly an\nhour.\nWhen I came back someone had thrown my laundry all over the floor, and shaped all my\nsocks into the word \u201cCOCK\u201d on the floor. I suspect that member of SocSoc who lives on the\nsecond floor did it, as half of my large collection of socks was actually missing.\nMy cashmere jumper was gone too, although mother said I shouldn\u2019t put it in the washing\nmachine. Maybe she knew someone would steal it from me\nSaturday 31st January\nJust picked up Felix whilst revising in the library, and read that SocSoc is actually\nPhilosophy Society. Pretty sure he still did it though as he\u2019s still a wanker.\nSunday 1st February\nAnother weekend in the library, doing an problem sheet paper. One of the questions was a\nbit dodgy; I am pretty sure a symbol was messed up somewhere but didn\u2019t know what to do.\nI have no idea if the question is impossible or not with the symbol as it stands. Maybe I will\nask my department facebook group, although not many people have posted on it since we\nposted that google doc with all those answers to that online quiz and then got done for it\nOh god what if it\u2019s cheating if I post on the group? Will whatsapp tutor group instead\nMonday 2nd February\nStill no resolve on problem sheet but handed it in anyways as I couldn\u2019t do any of it. I went\nout for dinner to Nandos with my hall afterwards, and we started talking about who is going\nDiary Of A Fresher aged 18 3/4\nto live with who next year.\nI really want to live in Hammersmith with a nice living room and kitchen, and my medic friend wants to\nlive near Charing Cross, so it works. There are eight of us, I reckon we could get a really big nice\nhouse and it will literally be like that series of Fresh Meat!\nTuesday 3rd February\nNo-one in my tutor group understood the question either, although one guy didn\u2019t even know we had\ncoursework set so he\u2019s fucked already.\nWednesday 4th February\nSaw American girl tonight at ACC, the theme was superheroes and she was dressed as \u201cPotato Girl.\u201d I\nasked her why and she said that is what the event told her to dress as, although she kind of looked\na bit bizarre, almost like a walking poo.\nI got off with her in Metric anyway\nKiss Kraye was there surrounded by a crowd of small Chinese girls, he seemed too busy to talk to me\nthough.\nThursday 5th February\nReceived an email about that problem sheet saying the question was impossible, but we were told that\nwe should probably just deal with it.\nIM SO ANGRY WHY SHOULD I DEAL WITH IT, IT WAS THEIR FAULT\nAlthough I scored zero for the rest of the questions, I could have totally done that question if they had\njust put the bloody symbol in the right part of the fraction! If this had happened in an a level exam\nit would have gone into the national news I swear.\nI hate Imperial.\nThis week as a poor 5th year\nmedic you fall into deep\ndespair over how hard it is to\nbe a medical student: you fret\nover your job security; how\nhard it is to drink continuously\nfor 6 years and then be handed\na medical degree; and how\ndifficult it was to have your\nparents choose your career for\nyou. Boo-hoo :(\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 13\nFELIX 6.02.2015\nScience Editor James Bezer & Lauren Ratcliffe\nScience\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nabout 3 million farmers produce\nenough grain to feed 2 billion\npeople.\nDespite the millions that these\nyield increases have the potential\nto feed, there are still 805 million\npeople malnourished in the world\ntoday, according to the World Food\nProgramme. Our gluttonous desires\nplace huge demand on energy\ninefficient foods such as meat. The\nmajority of grain produced is used\nfor livestock, reducing the resources\nfor nourishing people. With the\nabsence of meat consumption it is\nestimated that an additional billion\npeople could be fed.\nIt is not economically viable to\ngrow crops to feed animals for later\nconsumption by humans, effectively\nwasting about 90% of the energy\nthrough this additional step in the\nfood chain. 70% of the grain we\nproduce is used to feed livestock.\nOf this grain 16 times more is\nconsumed by cattle compared to the\nmeat that they provide.\nIt is effectively a food factory\nworking in reverse. Energy is\nrequired to process livestock, despite\nthe energy that has already been\nused to process the grain that they\neat. Nonetheless, the global demand\nfor meat is increasing, especially in\ndeveloping countries. Consumption\nof meat in China for example has\nquadrupled in the last 30 years. In\nthe US, the average person consumes\n50% more protein than the daily\nrecommended allowance. The\nconsequence is that crops are used\nto feed livestock and not humans.\nHow can this be justified when\nhunger kills more people every year\nthan Aids, Malaria and Tuberculosis\ncombined?\nThe energy inefficiency of\nlivestock consumption is not its\nonly undesirable trait. Staggering\namounts of water are required for\nlivestock production. 13,000 litres\nof water are used to produce 1 kg of\nbeef, compared to 100 litres used to\nproduce 1 kg of potatoes.\nIn addition, livestock production\nis exhaustive of huge areas of\nland. 94% more land is required\nto produce livestock than for\ncrop production. This means\nmore pesticide and fertiliser used\ncompared to merely farming crops\nfor direct human consumption.\nThe amount of energy needed\nto raise livestock, to produce\npetrochemicals as well as for storage\nand transportation makes \u201ccows\nmore damaging than cars\u201d in terms\nof our global footprint; says the\nHead of Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change.\nMonocultures \u2013 dull and\ndangerous\nBy creating monocultures of\ndomesticated plants and animals we\nare pushing out biodiversity created\nby millions of years of evolution\nfor our own ends. With denial\nand absence of action will only\ncome starvation and the currently\npracticed agricultural methods\ncannot be sustained.\nHowever pessimism does not\nallow development. Things can and\nare being done. Wheat crop plants\nare being genetically engineered,\nfor instance, so that they are able\nto fix nitrogen, making fertilisers\nunnecessary. Biological means of\npest control can be a sustainable\nalternative and tighter regulations\non pesticides are being issued.\nReduction in meat production will\nsignificantly increase agricultural\nsustainability. Alternative protein\nsources such as legumes and\nchickpeas can provide a good meat\nsubstitute and many more are being\ndeveloped. Even a small reduction\nin the amount of meat consumed\nby individuals will have long\nlasting beneficial effects making\nagriculture more sustainable. Less\nland would be required for the same\nnet energy gain, which would lead\nto a reduction in greenhouse gas\nemissions and water use, as well as\na greater percentage of the valuable\nnutrients being used directly for\nhuman consumption.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFood for thought\nThomas Robert Malthus prophesied\nfamine as population increase\noutstripped food supply in the 17th\ncentury. This has not yet become\nreality as Malthus did not foresee\nthe increase in yields due to\ntechnological advancement. But how\nmuch longer will the earth be able to\nprovide subsistence for mankind if\nwe are not willing to compromise?\nNo matter how far apart we\nbelieve we can set ourselves from\nnature, our reliance on it cannot be\ndisputed. Rather than disrupting\nnature\u2019s balance, agriculture needs\nto be integrated within it allowing\nfor sustainability and to feed an ever\nincreasing population.\n\u201cThe [new]\nepoch has\nallowed\nmachines\nto replace\nmen.\u201d\n\u201cRather than\ndisrupting\nnature\u2019s\nbalance,\nagriculture\nneeds to be\nintegrated\nwithin it.\u201d\nPlanes spraying pesticides onto fields. Pretty neat way of doing it, but how sustainable are these large-scale intensive agricultural practices? Photo credit: imgkid.com\n\n"

Photo: Channel 4\nGiulia Gabrielli reviews Thursday\u2019s LGBT drama bonanza\nAwkward is a family trait\nJack Whitehall has returned for the second season of\nBackchatwithJackWhitehall.His attempt to break into\nchat shows,however,can only be summarised in one\nword: awkward.Be it because of the presence of his\nelderly father,or because of the strange formulation\nof the show,watching it without cringing is actually\nvirtually impossible.\nThe episode structure is as follows: Jack presents the\nshow and introduces his co-host,Daddy Whitehall,as\na senile and racist weirdo that has somehow made it\nonto the set.Subsequently,enter two/three of the most\nill-assorted guest ever.\nA couple of weeks ago was a particularly good\nexample: Noel Fielding,the eclectic and colourful\ncreator of TheMightyBoosh,was paired up with Labour\npolitician John Prescott.What follows is usually a long\nlist of slightly embarrassing questions that make both\nthe audience and the guests shuffle around in their\nchairs in discomfort.\nThis may be a genius plan to really unmask the\npersonality of the guests,or maybe it is designed to be\nhilarious,but as a Brit who is morbidly mortified by\nconfrontation,either one seems rather unnecessary.\nIn the case of poor Noel Fielding,he appeared as\nthe sane and rational friend who is forced to watch as\nboyfriend and girlfriend,played in this case by long-time\nTori (surprise,surprise) Whitehall Senior and Prescott,\ngo at each other with teeth and nails.Awks.\nThe show is proof that the BBC isn\u2019t the only one\nexploiting Jack Whitehall\u2019s success.His agent and\ntalent-scout father,Michael Whitehall,having ventured\nout into the limelight,famous son at his side,almost\nseems like the Kris Jenner of British TV.I hope that a\nWhitehall endorsed internet sex tape doesn\u2019t crawl its\nway onto my screen.\n\t\t\t GIULIA GABRIELLI\nAt Christmas, Channel\n4 aggressively started\nadvertising its new LGBT\ndrama, signed by producer Russell T\nDavies from Queer as Folk. Maybe it\nwas because of the massive billboards\non Cromwell Road, or the ever-present YouTube clips, but I feel there\nwas a certain degree of anticipation\nbehind this release.\nCucumber, Banana and Tofu\nrepresent an attempt at a new\ntype of TV series. The main story,\nCucumber, runs on Channel 4 and is\nfollowed by E4\u2019s independent Banana,\nwhich focuses on the inner lives of\nsecondary characters. Tofu is Banana\nand Cucumber\u2019s love child, comprising\nof a series of interviews from the\npublic and the shows\u2019 actors about the\nnation\u2019s sexual attitudes.\nSo, having had the time to follow\nthe shows after they first aired three\nweeks ago, here is the verdict. The\nfirst is great, the second is good and\nTofu is the intellectual equivalent of\nThe Apprentice \u2013 You\u2019re Fired and any\nTV programme ever featuring Olly\nMurs: something you can only watch\nif you are really desperate for more\nuseless content.\nOne great thing about the main\nshow, aside from the brilliant\nacting, is the choice to write about\nthe adventures of older men, well\npast their sexual prime. This makes\na difference from the stereotypical\nglamorous gay-best-friend from Sex\nand the City and in fact it makes a\ndifference from most shows. Gay\nor straight it is great to know that\nour choices for the future don\u2019t\nexclusively include murderous\nMILFs from Desperate Housewives or\ncompletely de-sexualised suburban\nparent. Think Lizzie McGuire or other\nany Disney teen movie you\u2019ve ever\nwatched or heard of.\nBanana is a more introspective,\nsober show. With each episode\ndedicated to a different character,\nthe feel is more like a sensitive,\nbelievable Skins. The characters may\nnot look mad, dangerous and all that\nattractive, but their lives are equally\nenthralling.\nThe writing is intimate and the\ncasting varied and original, with\nmost of the actors coming from\nrelatively unknown backgrounds.\nThe stories are more slow-paced than\nin Cucumber, but still fascinating.\nA similar pleasure to listening to\nsomeone\u2019s conversation on the tube.\nIn a way, it\u2019s a shame that Tofu isn\u2019t\ngood. Featuring interviews with some\nof Britain\u2019s horniest grannies, and\nporn stars with such high-pitched\nvoices it is virtually impossible to\nunderstand what they are saying,\nI only recommend it if you are\ntoo bored for Countdown. Its crude\nand not particularly revolutionary\ncontent feels a bit like a slap in the\nface after the intimacy created by the\nfirst two shows.\nAll things considered, what with the\nshow being only in its third week, and\nwith most of the issues and characters\nhinted at not having been introduced\nyet, I look forward to following the\nconcept\u2019s development.\nPhoto: BBC\n\"Cucumber\nis great,\nBanana is\ngood, and\nTofu is the\nintellectual\nequivalent\nof any\nshow with\nOlly Murs\n.\"\n\n"

    "content": "Sport Editor: Kunal Wagle\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIssue 1596\n\u201cI want a win in this game more than any other\u201d\nThis week, the best (annual)\nsporting event kicks off\nwith the Six Nations, with a\nmouth-watering Wales vs England\ngame under the Friday night lights\nin Cardiff tonight. With England and\nWales in the same World Cup group\nlater this year the game is steeped in\nsignificance.\nEngland have, for the last ten years,\nbeen the nearly men in the Six, while\nWales have excelled. The last time\nEngland arrived at the Millennium\nStadium, they had a Grand Slam\non the table and were thoroughly\nstuffed by 30 points to 3. Last year\nat Twickenham, England recorded a\nrespectable victory of 29 points to 18.\nMake no mistake, the recent history\nbetween the two sides shows that\nneither holds a decisive advantage,\nand that the rub of the green and the\nvenue can make all the difference.\nWales, in what some have called a\nthinly veiled attempt at mind-games,\nnamed their squad a couple of days\nearly. It is such a settled squad that\nthere are just two changes from the\n2014 starting XV and only three from\n2013. This contrasts with England\nwho have at least five probable\nstarters out injured, and nine changes\nfrom the 2014 XV. The most striking\nof these changes has to be in the\ncentres, where the pairing of Roberts\nand Davies has started this fixture\nsince 2011. Expect Roberts to run\nsome hard lines at George Ford in the\n10 channel.\nThis is so different to England,\nwhere six months from the start of a\nhome Rugby World Cup not even the\ncoaches know what the best centre\npairing is. Tonight, Luther Burrell\nwill start in his favoured 12 shirt,\nwith Jonathan Joseph outside him at\n13. Joseph has been in sparkling form\nthis year, along with the whole Bath\nback line, and delivered a stunning\nperformance against Toulouse in the\nrevamped European Champions Cup\nto ensure that even without an injury\nto Manu Tuilagi he would have been\nright in the mix for the 13 shirt.\nThe last two games between these\nsides have seen the balance of power\nup front swing either way. In Cardiff\nin 2013 England got on the wrong\nside of Steve Walsh up front, while\nin Twickenham the following year\nWales rubbed Romain Poite up the\nwrong way so badly that Gethin\nJenkins was sent to the naughty step\nfor ten minutes after 53 minutes.\nExpect a massive battle up front,\nwith both packs trying to lay down\na marker for the impending World\nCup.\nImmortals win on Super\nBowl Sunday\nSunday 1st February saw the\nImmortals take a trip to the seaside\nto face Brighton Tsunami for the\nsecond time in the season.The first\ntime saw the Immortals dominate\nwith a 12-6 win at home.The team\nall packed onto the coach at 8am\nfor the two-hour drive to Brighton;\nlooking ready to take the second,\nand most important,win of the\nseason.This game was the most\nimportant in the Immortals\u2019season\nbecause it almost certainly decided\nwho would be relegated from the\nPremiership South division.\nThe game started well with strong\nrunning from Emanuel Olagbaju\nand Rayane Jackson as well as\ngood blocking from the offensive\nline,something that would\nbecome a theme throughout the\nmatch.However,unfortunately\nsomething else that would become\na theme was the Immortals\noffense struggling to finish their\nlong drives down the pitch with a\ntouchdown.\nThe Immortals defense looked\nas strong as ever putting huge\npressure on the quarterback with\nJack Cordrey getting an impressive\nsack as well as Jorn getting his\nhand on their signal-caller.Bob\nWorksfromhomealone laid down\na huge hit on their quarterback\ntaking him out of the game in the\nsecond half.The offense made\nthings difficult for themselves\nwith copious penalties on the day\ntaking away two touchdowns and\nextending their driving distance.\nThe only points scored in the\nmatch were a safety,scoring 2\npoints,because Brighton\u2019s punter\nmanaged to punt the ball out\nof the back of his own endzone\nwhen strong winds took the ball.\nHaving said that the Immortals\nshould have put up more points\nconsidering the offensive pressure\nand the defensive domination-discipline was lacking on the day,\nwhich made the match closer than\nit deserved to be.\nThe Most Valuable Players (MVP)\nof the day were: Jorn Jorg (Overall\nMVP for solid work put in on\noffence and defense),Henry\u2018has\na big head\u2019Turner (Offensive MVP\nfor strong blocking on the line),\nLittle Harry Collini (Line MVP for\nputting in big blocks on offensive\nline and dominating on defensive\nline) and Panukorn\u2018Teddy\u2019\nTaleongpongdong (Defensive MVP\nfor an overall great performance\non defense).\nAfter winning the game,the team\nwent on to host the Superbowl\nparty at the Union,which was a\nsuccessful and entertaining night\nthat saw the New England Patriots\ndefeat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24\nin amazing circumstances.Now\nthe team looks forward to playing\nHertfordshire on Sunday 8th\nFebruary and ACC on Wednesday\n4th February where the James\nAlden award will continue to be\nfought for.\nSAM HILL\nIMPERIAL IMMORTALS\nPhoto: Imperial Immortals\nThe old saying \u201cI support Wales,\nand anyone playing England\u201d is\nmassively overplayed. Wales are more\nthan good enough to not obsess over\nthe England game, but there is always\na certain spice to the occasion. As an\nEngland supporter I am not ashamed\nto say I want a win in this game more\nthan any other in the tournament.\nWe might be in more diverse days,\nwith many Welsh players plying their\ntrade this side of the Severn Bridge or\nearning the big bucks in France, but\nthis game is still hugely important. In\nthe excellent autobiography (Proud)\nof Gareth Thomas you read about\nLawrence Dallaglio banging on the\nWales dressing room door shouting\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been dicked\u201d after Wales\nsuffered a 60 point loss. Just try and\nsay this game doesn\u2019t matter to the\nplayers.\nWhatever happens this evening,\nI hope that we get to appreciate a\nfantastic game of rugby.\nIn Wales vs England we have the\nbiggest rivalry in the Northern\nHemisphere, and while it is so easy\nto read so much into every incident\nthis Six Nations, with the World Cup\naround the corner, we cannot forget\nthat this is a fantastic tournament in\nitself and a fantastic game to show off\nthis tournament.\nJonny Pratt previews tonight\u2019s Six Nations opener\nbetween England and Wales\nThe rivalry between England and Wales is fierce and steeped in tradition Photo: RBS 6 Nations\n\n"

Even the fantastic cheer\nsquad of Liam Smith, James Ellis\nand Tom Stokes \u2013 who were out due\nto injury but knew how amazing the\nweekend would be \u2013 were knackered.\nStuffed full but getting very cold and\nwet, there was just time for a quick\nteam photo before heading back\ninto Brighton for the celebrations to\nbegin!\nThe group headed to the down\nto the \u2018sea view\u2019 hostel a perfectly\nlocated base just 260m from the\nafterparty. After a hot shower (for\nabout 5 of us) and a cold one for the\nrest, the team headed over to Taste\nof the Sahara for the start of the\nevenings celebrations.\nThe theme of the evening was\n\u2018dress to impress\u2019 and so Imperial\u2019s\nteam interpreted this by channelling\nour inner-Brighton and wearing\nmatching tie-dye t-shirts, lovingly\nprepared the previous weekend by\nWill, Cloudy and others. The food at\nTaste of the Sahara was delicious and\nthe drinks were numerous.\nAfter the delicious meal, we\nreturned to the seafront to the BUCS\nafter-party which was being held at\nShooshh, which looked right out onto\nthe sea.\nOf course we first had to have an\nobligatory Tie-dye-team-on-thebeach photo before entering the club\nto set the trend in true ICXC fashion.\nWe attracted many an envious\ncompliment for our tie-dye outfits\nand were by far the best dressed there!\n\u2013 you might say they were tie-dye for!\nSpirits high, the party lasted until\nthe early hours \u2013 though some\nmembers of the team were forced\nto head home slightly earlier than\nothers. Some stayed it out however\nand there were talks of the higher\nlevel athletes showing the most\nstamina on the night out too, with a\nrumoured 4am scholarship selfie.\nThe next many shaken figures\ndragged themselves down to breakfast\n\u2013 some still in tie-dye out fits.\nFrom the cheering, shouting and\nsinging, there were suddenly a lot\nfewer people able to speak, and\nonly one made on a morning run.\nThere was a lot of sleeping on the\ntrain home and much resting will be\nneeded for the HYDE PARK RELAYS\non Saturday 7th Feburary.\nIf you want to join the epic\nadventures of Cross Country and\nAthletics, find us on Facebook or\nemail run@imperial.ac.uk.\nPretty fly for some Tie-Dye.

A committee of only seven\nstudents have put together the\nevening, and will see teams from each\nUniversity going head to head before\none team is crowned champion.\nTeams are made up of 15 to\n20 students, and their teams of\nsupporters can extend into the\nhundreds. This includes costume\ndesigners, their make up teams, and\nalso fans of the groups.

As long as the SCA\npatient carries his phone, he can\neasily monitor medicine dosage,\nhydration intake, or blood tests and\ntransfusion appointments, which can\nbe fairly frequent for this particular\ndisease.\nAlso, SiKL may act as a lifesaver. As\na person always carries his phone, in\ntimes of emergency SiKL may help\ndistinguishing his condition and\ntreatment needed more quickly.\nAccording to NHS figures, up to\n13,500 people in UK are affected\nby Sickle Cell Anaemia, and in\ndeveloping countries, this disease\nis even more prevalent.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 27\nFELIX 6.02.2015\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFred Fyles is amazed by this painter\u2019s long-awaited retrospective\nMarlene Dumas: The image as triumph\n\u201cArt is not a mirror.\nArt is a translation of that which you\ndo not know\u201d\n\u2013 Marlene Dumas\nThe earliest piece of figurative\nart in the world, the Venus of\nHohle Fels dates from 40,000\nyears ago. In the years between then\nand now we have had Ingres\u2019 bathers,\nDelecroix\u2019s Liberty, and Moore\u2019s\nvoluptuous granite blocks; surely\nthere is no angle left from which the\nhuman body has not been explored\nand depicted. The Tate Modern\u2019s\nlatest exhibition, Marlene Dumas: The\nImage as Burden, shatters this idea, as\nDumas\u2019 provocative, revolutionary\nportraits return the human figure to\nthe centre of art.\nUsing photographs as her primary\nimage, Dumas explores the very limits\nof the human form; in her Rejects\nseries, comprised of cast-offs from\nsome of her earlier works, human\nfaces seem made up of mere smoke.\nNebulous and sinister, this ongoing\nseries of 48 portraits assaults you with\ntheir intensity. Her first portraits,\ncompleted in 1975 whilst studying\nin her native South Africa, already\ndisplay this signature style; they see\nportraiture as a form of emotional\nexorcism, a purging of raw emotions,\nresulting in a psychologically\ncomplex body of work comparable to\nFrancis Bacon.\nDeath stalks through the galleries\nhere, emerging from many of\nDumas\u2019 works; in some, such as the\nportraits of dead women, death is\nimmediately present, but in others\none must scratch beneath the surface,\nonly to see the reaper staring back\nat you. From her first major show in\n1985, The Eyes of the Night Creatures,\nwe are shown a portrait of her late\ngrandmother. Surrounded with a\npale blue, the figure seems to dissolve\ninto the background, her benevolent\nexpression offset with a sense of\nunease at the smudges and drips that\ncover the painting like ectoplasm.\nWithin Dumas work there is a\nmelding of the sexual and the morbid,\ncalling to mind Freud\u2019s death drive \u2013\nthat desire to return to the inorganic.\nThis is most obvious in the last room\nof the exhibition; upon entering, the\nentire right wall is taken up with three\nclosely cropped portraits of women.\nWith their heads thrown back, it is\neasy to think that they are reclining\nin St Teresa-esque ecstasy; the\ndescription lets us know that Dumas\ntook as her source material pictures of\nthree dead women, a revelation that\nhits us square in the gut.\nAlthough Dumas has made\nAmsterdam her home in the mid-70s,\nher South African roots have driven\nher work, which is intrinsically\npolitical. By breaking down the\ntradition of figurative painting,\nDumas raises questions about gender,\nsexuality, and \u2013 most importantly\n\u2013 race. The theme of ethnicity is\none that occurs again and again in\nDumas\u2019 paintings. In the early 1990s\nshe began challenging the tradition\nof ethnographic photography, which\noften saw black people as mere bodies\ninstead of people; using these photos\nas a source material, she restores the\nsubjects\u2019 humanity, subverting the\nvery practice.\nElsewhere, she contrasts black\nbodies with white, whether this is by\nsimply switching the colour round on\npaintings of her infant daughter, or\nin her work The White Disease, which\ninterprets medical photography to\ndirectly oppose the Apartheid idea of\nthe \u2018Black Problem\u2019. Dumas looks at\nthe line where pain becomes beauty,\nwhere horror and delight merge\ntogether, in a Dionysian whirlwind of\nemotion.\nHer wide-ranging series Magdalenas,\nwhich was included in her collection\nfor the Dutch Pavillion in the 1995\nVenice Biennale, takes the female\nbody as a starting point, but veers\ndown a much more interesting\npath. The entire range of women\u2019s\nbodies are taken on by Dumas\u2019\ngaze \u2013 cherubic, Rubenesque nudes,\nresplendent in their fleshiness; and\nthin, angular black women, their hair\ncovering their breasts; Dumas knows\nthere is no point in trying to sum up\nthe full range of women\u2019s humanity\nwithin a single painting, and so\nextends her reach so wide as to take\non numerous archetypes.\nDumas uses the female form in\na variety of ways: in her Delecroixreferencing The Woman of Algiers, she\nreproduces a newspaper photograph\nof a Algerian prisoner captured by\nFrench forces, including the black\nbars covering her breasts and genitals;\nher Biennale piece Great Britain\n1995-7 contrasts two British icons\nof femininity, Naomi Campbell\nand Princess Diana, to explore how\nrepresentation is intrinsically linked\nto class and race; and in The Widow,\nPauline Lumumba bears her breasts\nin resolute agony as she walks the\nstreets of Leopoldville, mourning\nher murdered husband. While these\nwomen are used to raise questions\nof politics, their autonomy is not\ndestroyed \u2013 they are never seen as\ntools in Dumas\u2019 arsenal, but living\nbreathing expressions of femininity.\nAnd it is this that is one of the most\ninteresting aspects of Dumas\u2019 work:\nher obsession with the female form\nand the historical place of women,\nbut also her refusal to allow this to\nconstrain her. She is not a \u2018niche\u2019\npainter; not a \u2018woman\u2019 painter; she is\nsimply a painter of humanity, who\nallows the inner life of her subjects\nto shine through. This is reflected in\nwhat she has to say about the role of\nwomen in art history:\n\u201cHistorically painting was seen\nas female, but the males were the\npainters, and the females the models.\nNow the female takes the main\nrole. She paints herself. The model\nbecomes the artist. She created\nherself. She is not there to please you.\nShe pleases herself. The question is\nnot \u2018Who is she\u2019, but \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u201d\nDumas stares directly through the\nhistory of Western art, and questions\nits very foundations.\nOne of the most arresting of\nDumas\u2019 paintings is her portrait of\nher daughter Helena. Entitled The\nPainter, the original polaroid showed\nher daughter standing in the garden,\nsplattered with paint. In the painting,\nshe appears as a ghostly apparition,\nher skin paper-white and her feet\nblurring into the background. The\npaint on her hands remains, jumping\nout at us in blood-red. Ominous, yet\nstrangely placid, it is perhaps this\nimage, which Dumas described as\nexploring the \u201ccruelty and magic\nof innocence\u201d that best reflects her\nextensive body of work.\nThroughout the exhibition, we are\npresented with quotes from Dumas,\nalong with some of her (excellent)\npoetry. What comes across most\nstrongly is her sense of uncertainty\n\u2013 the word maybe crops up again and\nagain and at one point she doubts\nher abilities: \u201csometimes I think\nI\u2019m not a real artist, because I am\ntoo half hearted; and I never quite\nknow where I am\u201d. This retrospective\nleaves nothing in doubt; Dumas is\nmost certainly a real artist. With her\nability to transcend the limits of the\npaint and canvas, her innate sense for\npain and beauty, and her uncanny\npsychological insight, Marlene\nDumas is perhaps the most vital artist\nwe have today.\nMarlene Dumas: The Image As\nBurden is on at the Tate Modern until\n10th\nMay. Tickets \u00a314.50 adults; \u00a312.70\nconcessions.\nThe Widow, Marlene Dumas Image: Marlene Dumas\n\"Within\nDumas\u2019\nwork\nthere is a\nmelding of\nthe sexual\nand the\nmorbid\"\n\"The\nexhibit\nleaves\nnothing\nin doubt ...\nDumas is\nthe most\nvital artist\nwe have\ntoday\"\n\n"

    "content": "8 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n6.02.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nShould we freeze investment in fossil fuels?\nThe world is waking up to\nthe reality of approaching\ndangerous temperature rise.\nAnd that\u2019s without considering the\ncatastrophic hurricanes, changes\nto ocean currents, mass extinctions\nglobally, political instability, war,\nfamine, human displacement on\na biblical scale, and the growing\ninjustice of global inequality, with\never more power shifting to the 1%.\nIt seems that climate change action\nand sustainable awareness can no\nlonger be marginalised as a hippie or\n\u2018eco-warrior\u2019 problem. And in fact,\ndivesting out of the non-sustainable\nfossil fuel economy is perhaps not a\n\u2018fairy-tale dream\u2019, but something that\nis a lot more tangible.\nFounded in 2011 across just half\na dozen US college campuses, Fossil\nFuel Divestment is a movement\nthat has gained remarkable traction\nover a relatively short period of\ntime. Already, scores of educational\ninstitutions, philanthropic\nfoundations, religious groups and\ncities have joined the movement and\npledged to go \u201cfossil free\u201d.\nThe core of the movement is to get\ninstitutions to take their investments\nout of fossil fuels and thus indirectly\nsupporting and directly profiting\nfrom the wrecking of our planet.\nImperial, just like most other\nacademic institutions, has a huge\npot of money at its disposal. Its first\npriority is to protect those funds and\nget a good rate of return \u2013 to spend on\nits academic mission, i.e. you.\nWhat we are asking of Imperial is\nvery simple: we want them to freeze\nany new investment in fossil fuel\ncompanies, divest from current\ndirectly owned shares and any co-mingled funds that invest in fossil\nfuel companies within 5 years, and\ndraw up an ethical investment policy\nand confront their other unethical\ninvestments.\nSupport is growing like wildfire,\nin people as unlikely as the heirs to\none of America\u2019s most famous oil\nfortunes: the infamous Rockefellers\n\u2013 who announced last September\nthat they would be pulling their\nphilanthropic funds from fossil fuel\ninvestments.\n\u201cJohn D Rockefeller, the founder\nof Standard Oil, moved America out\nof whale oil and into petroleum,\u201d\nStephen Heintz, president of the\nRockefeller Brothers Fund, said in a\nstatement. \u201cWe are quite convinced\nthat if he were alive today, as an\nastute businessman looking out to\nthe future, he would be moving out\nof fossil fuels and investing in clean,\nrenewable energy.\u201d\nIn July the World Council of\nChurches, which represents over half\na billion Christians worldwide, also\ndecided to pull its investments out\nof fossil fuel companies. Archbishop\nDesmond Tutu put it: \u201cPeople of\nconscience need to break their ties\nwith corporations financing the\ninjustice of climate change\u201d. Even\nLeonardo DiCaprio is on board.\nThe endowment fund is comprised\nof hundreds of million of pounds,\nsome of which are directly invested\nin oil, coal and gas. Imperial has no\nethical investment policy.\nIn this year\u2019s University Green\nLeague we came 112th\nin the UK after\nscoring 0% for ethical investment.\nOxford, St. Andrews, and UCL have\nexplicit Responsible Investment\npolicies. Among the Ivy League\nuniversities in the USA, Harvard,\nBrown, and Columbia have an explicit\ncommitment to sustainable and\nresponsible investing.\nIf we were to divest, we would be\njoining Glasgow University, as well as\neighteen US universities, including\nStanford, which have already\ncommitted to divest from the fossil\nfuel industry. In the UK, student\nunions such as at King\u2019s and UCL are\ndemanding that their institutions\ntake similar action. SOAS, at the\nUniversity of London, has agreed to\na temporary freeze on investment\nin advance of a decision on full\ndivestment to be taken later this year.\nDecisions are also imminent\nfrom the University of Edinburgh,\nwhich conducted a consultation\nwith staff and students that was\noverwhelmingly in support of\ndivestment.\nOxford University and its colleges,\nwhich have an endowment wealth\nof \u00a33.8bn, is currently conducting a\nstaff-only consultation, after almost\n2,000 students and academics joined\na campaign calling for divestment.\nAndrew Taylor of the People and\nPlanet Network, which has launched\nover fifty \u2018Fossil Free\u2019 campaigns,\nsaid:\u201cDivestment now has a firm\nfoothold in the UK. Student and\nacademic pressure to get out of fossil\nfuels is building across the sector.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to stop profiting from\nwrecking the climate, whether you\u2019re\nan institution with lots of money\nlike Oxford or Edinburgh, or a world\nleader in climate research such as the\nUniversity of East Anglia.\u201d In our\nNew investments will release billions of tons of greenhosue gases into the atmosphere. Photo: ABC\nPhoebe Tickell talks about her involvement with Fossil Free Imperial\ncase at Imperial, we are both.\nThere are many arguments that\nspring to mind against divestment.\nWhy pull out our money, when it\nwill be immediately be replaced by a\nnew investment? Why bother, when\nuniversity level endowment funds are\ntiny compared to the investments of\nhuge financial institutions?\nOne only needs to open a newspaper\nand see the latest figures describing\nthe destruction of natural resources\nand the chaos caused by the growing\nclimate destabilisation. And climate\nchange is making inequality worse.\nWhile climate injustice is a relatively\nnew concept, its evidence abounds.\nAs extreme weather becomes more\nfrequent and severe, people on low\nincomes are the ones who will feel\nthe impacts first and worst every\nsingle time. And it is we in developed\ncountries, with our resource obsessed\neconomy and decades of collective\ndenial that have landed the world in\nthis position.\nFinancially, the transferral\nof investments is sound. Oil\ninvestments may give a good return,\nbut so do many other, ethical sources\nof return. Just because our money lies\nin one place, as a result of decisions\nmade years ago, does not mean it has\nto stay there forever. Times change,\nevidence emerges, and a responsible\nand clued up society reacts.\nOil, gas and coal companies play\nan active role in swaying politicians\nin the face of hard science. Just a\ncouple of weeks ago, 62 Senators\nvoted to approve the construction of\nthe Keystone XL oil pipeline system,\nwhich would translate into releasing\nas much as 1.37 billion metric\ntons of greenhouse gases into the\natmosphere.\nIt has now been shown that these\nvery Senators took as much as $31\nmillion in the form of financial\nsupport from Big Oil companies. This\nis not in the interest of the people,\nnor is it representative of public\nopinion. In fact, a recent poll found\nthat an overwhelming majority of\nthe American public, including half\nof Republicans, support government\naction to curb global warming.\nYou can say that we are just one\ninstitution, which in the grand\nscheme of investments, is not much.\nIf I were writing this article 3 years\nago, then yes, I would agree with you.\nOne, isolated boycott against fossil\nfuel companies could be likened to\na tree falling in an empty forest. But\nour move is not isolated, and many\npeople are listening.\nIt is a privilege to be able to do\nscience every day. It is a privilege to\nunderstand, more than many others\nacross the world, the science behind\nwhat is happening to the oceans,\nrainforests, atmosphere, people\u2019s\nhealth, and the future of the coming\ngenerations. But it is what we do with\nthe knowledge that will make all the\ndifference.\nIf you agree with us, consider\nsigning our petition. Your name\nwill join around 800 others that\nwe will be showing as a symbol of\nsupport when presenting our case to\nthe University fund managers. No\nmatter what you do, make it not be\ninaction. In the words of famous US\nenvironmentalist Edward Abbey,\nsentiment without action is the ruin\nof the soul.\n\n"

Photo: Foteini Christofilopoulou\nClara Clark Nevola reviews the Royal Opera House\u2019s take on a ballet classic\nA History of Islands & Patterns\nIf you want to gauge the measure of a culture,you only\nneed to look at their clothing.The stuffy moralism of the\nBritish Puritans was reflected in their monochromatic\ndress; the grotesque opulence of pre-revolutionary\nFrance is woven into the gowns of Marie Antoinette; and\n\u2013as the new exhibit at the British Museum shows us\u2013\nthe pattern on your barkcloth can mark anything from\nstatus,to age,to cultural group.\nFor those of you asking\u201cWhat\u2019s barkcloth?\u201d,I\nsympathise.While very rare here in the West,it is a\nmaterial made from soaked inner bark,which is then\nbeaten into a thin sheet,and was once-common across\nAsia,Africa,and the Pacific.It is this last location that\ncurator Natasha McKinney is interested in,showing us\nhow the patterns found on the cloth shift from island\ngroup to island group.In some Hawaiian groups,for\ninstance,the zig-zag pattern represents consecutive\ngenerations,indicating the longevity of the wearer\u2019s\nclan; in Oro province,Papua New Guinea,the pattern\nbelongs to a specific tribe,and therefore can be a marker\nof social group.\nThe display is arranged so that the patterns not only\nshift through space,but also through time.Thus,we can\nsee how technological changes influences the patterns\nand techniques.In Tonga,their contribution to the war\neffort is immortilised in their motifs of propellers.On\nNiue,developments in textiles meant that fringes and\nnew decoration techniques began to come to the fore.\nWe also have the opportunity to see how this traditional\ntechnique has been incorporated into modern dress,\nwith Samoan designer Paula Chan Cheuk using\nbarkcloth for a modern wedding dress,commissioned\nspecially for this exhibition.\nWhile we might not get an idea of how the tradition\nwas affected by Western exploration and colonialism\n(apart from a side note about wearing tunics to cover\nup),the show gives us an excellent overview of this\nquietly influential,beautiful tradition.\nShifting Patterns is on until 16th August.Free Entry.\nFRED FYLES\n\"Onegin is\nfar ... from\nstale but\nrather a\ndramatic\nmasterpiece\"\n\"Thiago\nSoares is\noutstanding,\nincredibly\nagile and\nenergetic.\"\nOnegin is a 1960s German\nballet based on a 19th\ncentury\nRussian novel in verse.\nLet the staleness of that sentence\nfully sink in before continuing, and\nthen think again. The Royal Opera\u2019s\nrevival of Onegin is far, far from stale,\nbut rather a dramatic masterpiece set\nto rousing music and performed by\noutstanding dancers.\nPushkin\u2019s dramatic novel Eugene\nOnegin has attracted much theatrical\ninterest recently, being staged as an\nopera, a modern dance and a ballet\nat various locations in London. The\nOnegin ballet was commissioned in\n1965 for the Stuttgart Company,\nand while the opera\u2019s score had been\ncomposed by Tchaikovsky, when\ncomposing the score for the ballet,\nlesser known piano pieces of his were\ncobbled together and adapted into\na surprisingly effective orchestral\nscore.\nI have to admit that I haven\u2019t\nploughed through the 389 stanzas\nof the Russian novel, so I\u2019m in no\nposition to relate how well the story\nand the sentiment are conveyed by\nthe ballet. But I can tell you that it\u2019s\na fantastically stirring performance,\nfull of all that you could want out of a\ncloak-clad 19th\ncentury Russian hero.\nFor those who, like me, haven\u2019t read\nPushkin\u2019s magnum opus, let me give\nyou the lowdown; Eugene Onegin is\na self-centred, arrogant, bored prick\nwho visits the countryside to sneer\nat the provincial nobility. Tatiana\nis a sheltered, bookish young girl\nwho falls for his swirling black cloak\nand scowl. She declares her love, he\nlaughs at her, tears up her love letter\nand throws it all over her. She\u2019s left\nbroken hearted. Somewhere along the\nline he also manages to kill Tatiana\u2019s\nsister\u2019s boyfriend, though this is a\nbit of a side plot. Years later, Eugene\nstrolls by a party and sees Tatiana\nas the beautiful wife of a prince. He\nrealises he loves her and tried to win\nher back. Tatiana has a bit of inner\nstruggle and then lets her anger loose\nand tears up his love letter to her. As\nPushkin put it \u201cwho\u2019s laughing now\nbitch?\u201d (or something like that, I\nforget the exact words).\nMarianela Nu\u00f1ez, in the role of\nTatiana, utterly bosses her role, which\nis staged in such a way to overshadow\nThiago Soares, supposedly the lead\ncharacter in his role of Eugene\nOnegin. Interestingly enough, the two\nare actually married in real life, so\nI shudder to think what the onstage\ndrama is doing to their private life.\nTatiana develops from a shy nerdy\nteen to a passionate would-be lover,\nwho crumples before our eyes under\nEugene\u2019s heartless rejection. On the\nnight after they first meet, Tatiana\nstays up all night imagining Eugene\n\u2013 and for an innocent bookworm\nshe has a fairly racy imagination!\nIn a bit of theatrical magic, Eugene\nsteps out of her mirror as she stands\nthere languidly, and a passionate\nand exhausting pas de deux ensues \u2019til\ndawn.\nTatiana again carries the\nperformance of the night of her\nrejection of Eugene, as a grown\nwoman. Her stately serene maturity is\nbroken by the sudden and unexpected\nintrusion of Eugene- she breaks\ndown, swayed between the giddying\npossibility of escaping with her first\nlove and the responsibilities she\nhas as a married person. The pas de\ndeux that follows, the echo of her\nteenage dreams, is breath-taking,\nand culminates in her resolution; she\ndraws herself up, the passion turns to\nice and Eugene, covered in fragments\nof love letter, is banished from the\nroom.\nTechnically, Thiago Soares is\noutstanding, incredibly agile and\nenergetic. But, perhaps on account\nof the choreography more than the\ndancer, he seems much more of a\none dimensional cut-out character\nthan the wonderful, theatrical and\npassionate performance that Nu\u00f1ez\nbrings to her role. This causes a bit\nof dramatic implausibility, as we\u2019re\nat times left confused as to why such\nan obviously cool, superior woman\nwould waste her tears over such\na shallow moody man. But then\nagain, that\u2019s a depressingly familiar\nsituation\u2026\nOnegin is at The Royal Opera House\nuntil 27th\nFebruary.
