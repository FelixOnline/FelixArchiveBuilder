He worked as Chairman and\nChief Executive of GlaxoSmithKline\nPLC before taking on the College\u2019s\nleading role in 2001.\n\u201cTo be very honest with you,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cit\u2019s the only job in the higher\neducation sector I would have taken,\nbecause it plays to my strengths. I\u2019m\ninterested in the integration of sci-ence, technology and medicine, so\nthere was only one job and this was\nit.\u201d\nWhen he first began work at\nImperial, Sir Richard was \u201cshocked\u201d\nby the political arena in which the\nCollege operates, \u201cbeing a private\ninstitution in a sense, but being totally dominated by Government.\u201d\nHe thinks the Labour party is \u201cthe\nonly one with a sensible policy on\nhigher education,\u201d and appears to\nregret that their majority has been\nreduced. \u201cEven with a big majority\nthey had difficulties getting their bills\nthrough, so making big leaps forward\nwill not be easy.\u201d\nA proponent of university top-up\nfees, the Rector believes that students should make a greater contribution to the cost of their education.\nAccording to him, the new system is a\nstep in the right direction but doesn\u2019t\ngo far enough.\n\u201cTo educate someone at Imperial\nCollege in the subjects we teach and\nthe way that we teach them is expensive,\u201d he says, outlining an argument\nhe has made many times before.\n\u201cEven with the \u00a33000 contribution per\nstudent, we\u2019ll still be making a loss on\neach student we educate. That money\nhas to come from somewhere.\u201d\nSo if \u00a33000 per student per year is\nnot enough, what would be the ideal\nsolution to this complex problem?\nAnti-fees campaigners should look\naway now...\n\u201cFor the top institutions in the coun-try, and you can count them on one\nhand, let them operate in a market...\nlet them make the decision about\nwhat they want to charge. We charge\ncompetitive fees for those who come\nfrom overseas now, and that is what\nwe\u2019d charge.\u201d\nBased on the 2005-6 figures, this\nwould mean that home students\nwould pay enormous tuition fees of\nbetween \u00a311,750 and \u00a324,900 per year,\ndepending on their course of study.\nAt first glance, it would appear that\nsuch proposals might completely\ndeter all but the richest prospective\nstudents from applying to Imperial\nCollege.\nSir Richard disagrees. \u201cWe did\nsome modelling going back three\nyears. If we charged 30% of students\nthe full fees, we could pay for the 70%\nwho couldn\u2019t afford the full fees. It\u2019s a\nquestion of balance.\n\u201cIn my opinion it\u2019s totally wrong to\nsay that you\u2019re charging students to\ncome to university therefore you\u2019re\ndenying those from financially disadvantaged backgrounds. It\u2019s absolutely not true and the evidence is exactly\nthe opposite \u2013 the higher you charge\nthose who can afford it, the more you\ncan use to pay for those who can\u2019t.\u201d\nAlthough top-up fees of \u00a33000 per\nstudent per year will not be enough\nfor the Rector, the new system will\nstill bring millions of pounds into\nthe College. How will the money be\nused?\n\u201cAs you know, a third of it will go\ninto bursaries,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I\nthink we\u2019ve got to make sure that\nwe try to ring-fence that money for\nstudents and teachers as much as\npossible. We\u2019re already, as I\u2019ve said\nto you before, still losing \u00a32500 a year\non average for each student, so it will\nhelp to make up that, but also we\u2019ve\ngot to put it into the infrastructure for\ngood teaching, because teaching is\ncritically important in an institution\nlike this.\u201d\nEducation and the\nGovernment\nThe Government is still persisting\nwith its infamous \u201850% target\u2019 of\nschool-leavers going to university. Sir\nRichard would prefer to set a different goal: \u201cOur target should always\nbe to educate people to their maximum potential. Whether that\u2019s 40%,\n50% or 80%... you\u2019ll have achieved\nyour target by developing them to\ntheir maximum potential.\u201d\nHe believes that \u201cwe have to help\neveryone,\u201d but he stresses that people are different and have different\nneeds when it comes to education.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not pretend that we all have\nthe same potential, because we don\u2019t\nhave the same potential.\u201d\nHe also finds time for a dig at the\nso-called \u2018new universities\u2019. \u201cWe call\neverything a university today, so of\ncourse there\u2019s no differentiation.\u201d\nSir Richard would prefer a move\ntowards a US-style system, where it\nis easier to return to further or higher\neducation after a few years out. \u201cWe\nneed to give people the flexibility of\nchoice, because not everybody will do\nwell at the same time.\u201d\nOverseas students and\npostgraduates\nNational newspapers reported in\nDecember that Imperial College\nplanned to increase its numbers of\noverseas students and postgraduates in an attempt to raise funds.\nGovernment restrictions on tuition\nfees do not apply to these groups,\nallowing the College freedom to\ncharge whatever it wants.\nSir Richard acknowledges that the\nnumber of overseas students will\ncontinue to grow and that \u201cit is difficult to believe that this College could\noperate at this level if we didn\u2019t have\naccess to that money.\u201d However, he\nclaims that the numbers are increasing not for financial reasons, but\nbecause Imperial is receiving more\napplications from overseas students\nand because they are usually better\neducated.\nBetter educated? \u201cIt isn\u2019t that\nthey\u2019re smarter, it\u2019s the way they\u2019ve\nbeen taught I suspect, because they\ntend to do traditional A-levels in\nSingapore and Hong Kong, whereas\nhere we change things about so damn\nmuch, you can go through A-level\nmaths without doing any calculus!\u201d\nSir Richard favours a return to traditional teaching in Britain\u2019s schools,\nespecially in science subjects.\n\u201cScience isn\u2019t exciting from a book,\u201d\nhe insists, \u201cscience is exciting when\nyou start to apply it. I was brought\nup to do biology three times a week,\nphysics three times a week, chemistry three times a week, you know,\nin a laboratory, blowing things up in\ncalorimeters, cutting out eyes and\ndissecting them...\n\u201cYou have to produce the teaching,\nyou have to produce the money, and\nyou have to have the commitment.\u201d\nReturning to the issue of funding,\nthe Rector highlights the responsibility of the Government and stresses\nthat British universities are in a difficult financial position: \u201cThe government of the day have to recognise\nthat if they want internationally competitive universities in this country,\nthey\u2019ve got to be funded properly. I\nthink it\u2019s amazing that we still have a\nhandful of universities here that can\ncompete, but you know, we\u2019re hanging on by our shirt tails.\u201d\nHe accepts that if the financial situation worsened, the College might\nhave to take more overseas or postgraduate students in order to boost\nfunds. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly one approach.\nI think that would be a very detrimental step, but it\u2019s another option...\u201d\nThe University of London\nThe University of London (UL) is\na federation of 19 London colleges,\nincluding Imperial. Our degrees are\nofficially awarded by UL, but today\nit has very little involvement in\nImperial\u2019s affairs. So what is the point\nof being part of it?\n\u201cNot a lot,\u201d replies the Rector\nbluntly. He accepts that UL provides\naccess to sports competitions and\nintercollegiate halls of residence, but\nis confident that this could continue\nin a similar vain through agreements\nwith other colleges, even without UL.\n\u201cOtherwise,\u201d he adds, \u201cwe are paying\na lot of money to an organisation from\nwhich we get very little return. So the\nintention is to pull out.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, we want\nensure that students have access to\nthe sporting facilities and the halls of\nresidence, and if that can be sorted\nout quickly, that would be good.\u201d\nLibraries\nA letter in this week\u2019s Felix from an\nanonymous central library librarian\n[see page 7] says that 24/7 opening is\n\u201ca nightmare\u201d and has \u201ctransformed\nwhat usually looks like a second rate\npolytechnic library into a total dump\u201d.\nThe letter claims that the College is\naiming \u201cto cram yet more departmental libraries plus their users into\nthe central library,\u201d which itself has\nbecome \u201can embarrassment\u201d.\nSir Richard reacts with a smile.\n\u201cI think people have to move with\nthe times,\u201d he says. \u201cTwenty-four\nhour opening seven days a week is\nnot easy because the library wasn\u2019t\nbuilt for that. People have to eat and\ndrink, which does make the place\na bit different, but we have to deal\nwith that at the moment. If we had\nWaterstone\u2019s converted into a nice\ncaf\u00e9 area, it would be much easier.\u201d\nHe is certain that the central library\nis \u201cnot an embarrassment, absolutely\nnot... rest assured, this is the way for-ward, it has to be 24 hours a day, seven\ndays a week. We have to consolidate\nas many of the departmental libraries\nas possible, because you cannot work\nin a departmental library 24 hours a\nday, seven days a week.\u201d\nIt soon becomes clear that \u2018consolidating\u2019 a departmental library translates to closing it and moving the\nstock to the central library.\nHe insists that such moves are\n\u201cin the best interests of students\u201d,\ndespite the fact that a petition against\n\u2018consolidating\u2019 the mechanical engineering library was signed by over\n500 students.\n\u201cThe problem is that [the depart-mental] library is not open 24 hours a\nday seven days a week, and I believe\nthat\u2019s what students want.\u201d\nRebranding\nImperial\u2019s recent rebranding exercise has received particular criticism\nfrom students. The famous traditional\ncrest has been replaced by simple\nblue type on a white background.\n\u201cI just think one has to move forward,\u201d says the Rector. \u201cFirst of all,\nthe old crest is from a bygone age.\nIf you look on a page, you see a nice\nadvert with Imperial College London\nand you don\u2019t have to read all this\nother stuff about Imperial College of\nScience, Technology and Medicine.\u201d\nThat might be a sensible policy for\njob adverts, but what about all those\nsigns? \u201cThey want to be clear and\nuncomplicated. It\u2019s not that we\u2019ve\ndiscarded the crest, we\u2019re just using\nit for special occasions.\u201d\nI ask Sir Richard whether he knows\nany students who actually like the\nnew branding.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t actually personally\ngone around and done a survey,\u201d he\nreplies, after a long pause. \u201cI think\nit\u2019s an interesting concept, isn\u2019t it,\nthat students at Imperial are unbelievably conservative...\u201d\nThe summer ball\nThis year\u2019s Imperial College Union\nSummer Ball will be held on the South\nKensington campus on Saturday 18\nJune, with \u00a320,000 of funding coming\ndirectly from the College. I ask the\nRector whether the ball is worth the\ninvestment.\n\u201cI think that these community occasions are very important. I know why\nit went to Alexandra Palace [last\nyear] but I think it\u2019s very important\nto have it here, because students\nassociate with this place, you\u2019ve got a\nbeautiful area on the Queen\u2019s Lawn,\nyou\u2019ve got all sorts of potential, so I\u2019m\nhappy to give that money for students\nto have a nice occasion that doesn\u2019t\ncost them the earth, where they can\nhave a meal if they wish to, and enjoy\nthemselves.\u201d\nHe is quick to add: \u201cSpeaking of\n\u2018worth it\u2019, what are we building an\n\u00a318m sports centre for? It\u2019s something that is part of the package. If we\nwant to bring the best students here,\nwe want to encourage them, show\nthat we care about them...\u201d\nContrary to statements from the\nUnion, Sir Richard tells me that\nthe new sports centre will open in\nOctober.\nCharing Cross Hospital\nNational newspapers have claimed\nthat Charing Cross Hospital, a main\nteaching site for Imperial College\nmedical students, is set to close.\nThe Rector reassures current and\nprospective medical students that\nthis will not occur in the near future.\n\u201cHospitals don\u2019t close quickly, it just\ndoesn\u2019t happen that way. To close\nCharing Cross might have been,\nin someone\u2019s mind, a good idea in\nterms of efficiencies, but it\u2019s going\nto cost them an enormous amount\nof money to do that, and I don\u2019t see\nthat money coming from anywhere\nat the moment. So I would think that\nCharing Cross would still be operating reasonably well in ten years\u2019\ntime.\u201d\nThe future\nSir Richard acknowledges the intensive nature of study at Imperial\nCollege. \u201cThis is a College where\npeople work, it ain\u2019t a College where\npeople play.\u201d\nHe is proud of its reputation and\nbelieves that \u201cImperial has done\nextremely well\u201d to be consistently\nranked in the top three UK universi-ties. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feat when you\nthink we\u2019re not even 100 years old...\nand that\u2019s excellence, that\u2019s quality,\nthat\u2019s standards, that\u2019s bringing the\nbest people here both in terms of\nstaff and students. That has to be the\nfuture, and that can\u2019t change.\u201d\nHe stresses the importance of links\nbetween higher education and busi-ness. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious to me that\nif we [the UK] are to remain competitive in the world, our higher education system has to be turning out the\nright people. Otherwise people aren\u2019t\ngoing to invest in the UK.\u201d\nHe tells me that the College must\n\u201cget more financial support from\nwherever we can. We\u2019ll continue to\nrebuild this campus and the other\ncampuses, because if we want good\npeople we\u2019ve got to give them a good\nenvironment.\u201d\n\u25cf Next week: are you getting\na world-class education at\nImperial?

If you\u2019re\non a shoestring budget (and\nlet\u2019s face it, who isn\u2019t at this\ntime in the year?) you can\nassemble one from a pencil,\ntwo plastic bowls, two sticks\nand some string, but it\u2019s probably easier and less painful to\nbuy one.\nAs a general rule, the\nfaster you spin it, the more\nstable the diabolo becomes,\nand the less likely it is to\nfly off and hit something.\nYears of experience have\nrevealed that a diabolo gravitates primarily towards pints\nof beer \u2013 consider yourself\nwarned.\nAt this point, some people\nmay be nodding smugly to\nthemselves and mumbling: \u201cI\ncan do that!\u201d Since this may\nwell be true, we have tried\nto make things a bit more\nimpressive. While there are\nmany ways to make juggling\nharder and consequently\nmore impressive, we\u2019ll stick\nto just one \u2013 having more\nthings in the air at once [see\npicture 1].\nTo keep two diabolos on a\nstring is much harder than\njust one diabolo. First of all,\nthey have a tendency to hit\neach other with catastrophic\nconsequences and, as such,\nyou\u2019ve got to figure out a way\nto keep them apart.\nFirst thing\u2019s first: just start\none spinning. The easy way is\nto give it a good run-up [see\npicture 2] and just keep pulling the string. Alternatively,\nyou can use Nez\u2019s \u201csuperior\u201d\nmethod shown here [see picture 3]. Please carefully note\nthe superiority.\nNow wrap the string around\nthe axle of another diabolo\nand with rapid whipping\naction (buy an \u2018S&M Action\nMan \u2013 with new kinky moves\u2019\nfor more details on tech-nique), start the diabolo spinning [see picture 4].\nOnce it\u2019s up to speed,\nunwrap the string by moving the handstick. As the\ntop diabolo falls down the\nstring, toss the other one over\nit [see picture 5]. Be patient\n\u2013 if you toss it too early then\nyou\u2019ll just end up in a horrible\nmess as it will collide with\nthe other diabolo on the way\ndown.\nIfanyone\u2019sstillfeelingsmug,\nthey can email juggling@ic.\nac.uk and show us how wonderful they are every Tuesday\nthroughout term at the Union\nfrom 6pm. Alternatively if\nyou\u2019re amazed and want to\nknow more, email or turn up\nand we\u2019ll be slightly nicer\nto you.\nJUGGLING CLUB\nTen things I can do that you can\u2019t\nEPISODE NINE: Two diabolos\n1\n2 3 4 5\nBy Beinan Liu\nThe Imperial College Chess\nclub ended the year with one\nof the best performances\nseen in recent years.\nThe Imperial team of eight\nplayers competing in the\nMiddlesex League (Division\n3) won all our matches and\ngained automatic promotion as outright winners of\nthe division, thanks to a brilliant team effort (key players:\nPeter Levermore, Kanwal\nBhatia, Edward Leung,\nRichard Thursby, Richard\nCrampton, Malcolm Bovey\nand Anup Sinha) under the\nleadership of captain Slava\nBurenkov.\nTheclubalsoenteredateam\nin the ULU Chess League,\ncaptained by Beinan Liu\n(key players: Felix Balthasar,\nRobin Nandi, John Sargent,\nDave Man), which dominated\nthe league throughout the\nseason along with arch-rivals\nUCL but narrowly missed out\non the top spot. However, on\nthe bright side, we did beat\nour previous arch-rivals LSE\nvery convincingly. Their final\nleague position was third, a\nlong way from causing any\ncredible threat to the Imperial\nteam.\nThis year, there has also\nbeen a significant increase in\nthe number of internal chess\ntournaments and events.\nThanks to president Anup\nSinha for his hard work and\na great team effort by the\nwhole committee. Imperial\nChess has stepped into a new\nera of glory!\nChess league\nchampions\nCHESS CLUB\nBy Oscar Dahlsten\nIt has been a fascinating two\nterms for Qigong at Imperial,\nand there appears to be more\nahead.\nQigong is an ancient\nChinese system of mind and\nhealth regulation. \u2018Qi\u2019 is often\nbest translated as energy\nand sometimes as informa-tion. \u2018Qigong\u2019 is then \u2018energy\nwork\u2019.\nIn the traditional Chinese\nmodel, our wellbeing is\ndependent on the nature and\nbehaviour of the qi in the\nbody. In a healthy state one\nhas abundant qi, which is led\nby the spirit in a harmonious\nmanner. Whilst modern science would use a different\nconceptual network, it too is\nrecognising the importance\nof the complex interaction\nbetween mind and body. At\nImperial there is a small\nbut growing group taking an\ninterest in this.\nThe autumn term saw a\none-month intensive course\ngiven by an eminent visitor\nfrom China, professor Yafei\nLiu, Director of the China\nNational Qigong Training\nInstitute. She taught us\na Qigong system passed\ndown to her by her father\nDr Guizheng Liu. He is considered the father of modern\nQigong and is credited with\nbringing many ancient practises under empirical scruti-ny, naming them \u2018Qigong\u2019 and\napplying them successfully in\nChina\u2019s first Qigong hospital.\nYafei was invited here by\nthe London Academy of\nTraditional Chinese Medicine\nand Qigong and the Imperial\nChinese Wushu Society. It\nseems all enjoyed her clear\nmethod of teaching and\ncharming, positive approach.\nDuring this visit we were\ntreated to a session by\nProfessor John Gruzelier,\nprincipal investigator of psy-chophysiology at Imperial,\non the mind-body connection in modern medicine.\nHe presented results from\nvarious experiments in his\ngroup linking performance\nas well as health with the\nmental state. They had used\na method called biofeedback\nto improve performance of\nImperial dancers and Royal\nCollege musicians. They also\nnoted that antibody levels of\nImperial students decreased\nduring exam periods, but\nthis effect was reversed for\neach member of a trial group\npractising positive visualisa-tions from a Qi-based system\ncalled Johrei.\nWe are now hoping to organise research specifically on\nQigong with Imperial. If you\nare a medical student and\ninterested in doing a project,\nplease contact the author of\nthis article. Members of the\nphysics department interested in experiments for detecting and quantifying qi, please\ndo the same.\nWe were also honoured to\nhave a very brief visit from\nChina by Dr Yang and col-leagues. He is the inheritor\nand grandmaster of Yang\nTaijiquan, the most widely\npractised Taiji-style in China.\nThere are currently Qigong\nclasses running every two\nweeks at Imperial, taught\nby Professor Zhao on behalf\nof the Chinese National\nQigong Training Institute.\nThere will be several more\nintensive courses given by\nQigong world authorities visiting from China, beginning\nwith Professor Shengbing\nZhang, former director of\nQigong research at Nanjing\nUniversity of Chinese\nMedicine, in mid-May. From\n27 July, Professor Tianjin Liu,\ndirector of Qigong research at\nBeijing University of Chinese\nMedicine, will teach for a\nmonth.\nAll are welcome (large discounts for staff and students).\nFor more info or to be added\nto the email list, email oscar.\ndahlsten@ic.ac.uk\nWebsites: www.union.\nimperial.ac.uk/wushu/qigong,\nwww.tcmqigongacademy.\ncom.\nQigong at Imperial\nCHESS CLUB\n\n"

    "content": "To summarise, The Jacket is \u2013 at\nbest \u2013 mildly diverting. I found the\nscript weak, leading to a lot of loose\nbeginnings, an implausible plot, and\nthe whole thing was slow moving\nuntil the end. Yawn.\nThe actors were good but mis-cast. Keira Knightley is adequate\nas the drunken trailer trash but\nthere\u2019s little, if any, on-screen chemistry between her and Adrien Brody.\nBrody does well in his character, but\nthe film as a whole doesn\u2019t fit well\ntogether.\nBy the end of it, The Jacket is\none of those \u201cin the future you can\nchange your past\u201d films. Brody, on\ngood form, is cast as an ex-soldier\nwho loses his memory and ends\nup committed to an asylum for the\ncriminally insane, after being falsely\naccused of murder. Enter wacko\ndoctor who locks him in a morgue\ndrawer, strapped in a strait jacket\nand jacked up with some banned\ndrugs for a few hours. The aim: to\nrid Brody of his supposedly violent\ntendencies. What actually happens:\nBrody can travel into the future.\nAnd when he does, he finds out he\nis going to die in four days, so he\ntries to find out who kills him and,\none supposes, stop this event. There\nare a lot of loose beginnings here,\nwhich seem to be the parts where\nthe scriptwriters think: \u201cOK so this\nguy killed him!\u201d and then change\ntheir mind to the other one, then\nto the other guy and then... without\nchanging the mini-climaxes dotted\naround the place.\nKnightley is a disjointed link to a\nlittle girl who becomes his romantic\nin the future (where he hasn\u2019t aged),\nand his reverse clairvoyant who\nhelps him find out who kills him.\nThere\u2019s a lot going on that doesn\u2019t\nhave anything to do with where the\nfilm is going, which is where I was\ndisappointed. I do nitpick more than\naverage, so maybe if you decide to\npart with seven or eight quid you\nwill find the film more rounded.\nAnd how slow can a film start? I\nwas itching for it to finish for a good\nhour until the ten minutes where\nit got slightly interesting. It is only\ntowards the end that you can get\nimmersed slightly into the film, and\nbegin to follow the characters with\nmore interest. However this doesn\u2019t\nlast long and the ending is too soppy\nfor me. Give me a Clint Eastwood\nboxing flick any day of the week!\nFinal say from me? Don\u2019t bother waiting for the DVD either\n(unless you like Hollywood\u2019s obtuse\nattempts at making the audience\n\u201cthink outside the box\u201d or whatever\nrubbish they come up with). Oh, and\nit\u2019s not scary either, so there\u2019s no\npoint taking your girlfriend for the\n\u2018gripping-moments-in-the-cinema\u2019\nthing.

It can\u2019t be true\nI know what you\u2019re thinking...\nJennifer Lopez and movies don\u2019t\ngo very well together. Well yes, in\nthe recent past this has proven true\nwith celluloid disaster after celluloid disaster. However, this time,\nshe may just have managed to come\ngood. Her new film is Monster-in\nLaw and it is modern take on a very\nold tale... girl meets boy, they fall\nin love, girl meets boy\u2019s psycho\nmother. So there is no surprise that\nwhat ensues is a sweet comedy with\na little romance, a lot of screaming and quite a few right (and left)\nhooks.\n\u2018Jenny from the Block\u2019 stars as\nCharlie, a loveable if directionless\ntwenty-something looking for love.\nShe meets Kevin, a handsome rich\nsurgeon who wants to treat her like\na lady. Meanwhile, Kevin\u2019s successful newswoman mother Viola (Jane\nFonda) is blissfully unaware of her\nson\u2019s new relationship. This is partly due to her very public and very\nfunny nervous breakdown which\nleads to her being committed to a\npsychiatric hospital. So when Kevin\nand Charlie get engaged, Viola\ndecides that Charlie is all wrong\nfor her son and sets about driving\nher away.\nLopez does what she does best,\nplaying the adorable and quirky\nheroine who is hindered in reaching\nromantic bliss by her loveless past.\nMichael Vartan (Alias) and Lopez\nshine brightly as the two young lovers but without being too syrupy\nand with just enough chemistry.\nThe comedy is provided through\nthe friction between mother and\ndaughter-in-law beautifully. Jennifer\nLopez actually has very good comic\ntiming and her slow but convincing conversion from innocent bride-to-be to irate daughter-in-law is\nvery well done. Her tussles with\nViola are naturally the highlight of\nthe film and Jane Fonda is fabu-lous. Completely over the top and\nglamorous, she manages to demonstrate Viola\u2019s ferocity as well as\nclearly showing her insecurity of\nbeing left out of her son\u2019s life. Her\ncrazy schemes to drive Charlie\naway draw a lot of laughs but it is\nher interaction with her long-suf-fering personal assistant that really\nmakes this film hilarious.\nRuby (Wanda Sykes) brings to life\nViola\u2019s often ignored conscience,\nproviding a voice of reason to her\nboss\u2019s madness. Ruby\u2019s dry humour\ncontrasts beautifully with Viola\u2019s\nhistrionics.\nThe storyline is a little thin on the\nground but is just about enough to\ncarry the film through. The auxiliary characters in the movie are not\nreally utilised and I think Charlie\u2019s\ngay best friend was just a little too\nclich\u00e9d. That said, the supporting\ncast did do their best and did manage to provide a few extra laughs.\nThe film starts off well enough\nbut somehow actually manages to\nmiss out the meat and bones of any\nromantic comedy \u2013 the \u2018falling in\nlove bit\u2019 that all the girls out there\nwant to see. I guess this helps to\nmake the film less saccharine and\nmore about getting the audience\nlaughing. And it\u2019s not so bad, as the\nfilm compensates by focusing on\nthe relationship between the two\nwomen.\nSo Monster-in-Law is funny, it\nis sweet and, if on one of these\nlazy hazy sunny days that is what\nyou\u2019re looking for, it definitely comes\nthrough.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 19 May 2005 9\nEveryone needs a theory by which\nto explain the world, to manage\nrelationships, to win friends and\ninfluence people. Now a new philosophical theory is emerging that\ncould revolutionise our perspective\non politics, law, and Union strategy.\nThis groundbreaking new outlook\ntouches on a largely unexplored\nphenomenon: the tendency to bull-shit.\n\u201cThere are exquisitely sophisticated craftsmen who \u2013 with the\nhelp of advanced market research,\nof public opinion polling, of psychological testing, and so forth \u2013 dedicate themselves tirelessly to getting\nevery word and image they produce\nexactly right. Yet there is something\nmore to be said about this. However\nstudiously and conscientiously the\nbullshitter proceeds, it remains\ntrue that he is also trying to get\naway with something.\u201d\nInternationally renowned moral\nphilosopher Professor Harry G\nFrankfurt has set out to broach this\ndifficult subject. First exploring the\nconcepts of bullshit and humbug,\nhe observes that they are not quite\nthe same as lying. In his thesis On\nBullshit, he concludes that excessive indulgence can be an even\ngreater enemy to the truth than old-fashioned deceit:\n\u201cIt is impossible for someone to\nlie unless he thinks he knows the\ntruth. Producing bullshit requires\nno such conviction. [The bullshit-ter] does not care whether things\nhe says describe reality correctly.\nHe just makes them up, to suit his\npurpose.\u201d\nAlthough there\u2019s something darkly comic about his academic text,\nregularly punctuated with the words\nbullshit and excrement, this new\ntheory can provide a serious perspective on recent Union publica-tions.\nA glimpse at the impressive Union\nStrategy brochure reveals some\ncharacteristic qualities. Printed on\nthick high-quality paper in an unusual landscape format, the professional graphic design is something\nyou might only expect from a burgeoning investment bank, a modern\npolitical party or a private arts col-lege. But despite its incredibly glamorous presentation, the Union is still\nfixated on its \u201cbrand and identity\nissues\u201d. Some recently published\nobjectives for the South Kensington\nrefurbishment reveal the severity of\nthe situation:\nObjectives:\n\u2022 Create a cohesion out of the\ndisparate functions of the Union\nbuilding\n\u2022 Establish a new Union identity\n\u2022 Unite the spaces together\nthrough the design language of\nthe circulation and the spaces\nthemselves\n\u2022 Wayfinding will be instinctive\nthrough the new identity\n\u2022 The functions will be\ndistinguished but part of the same\nfamily\nSo, if you found the Union Strategy\nimpressive, you can only wait in\nkeen anticipation of the Union refur-bishment. Once again, it appears\nthat some budding executives, marketing managers and politicians\nhave united with postmodern artists\nand unwittingly (or perhaps strate-gically) disappeared up their own\nbrilliance.\nIf you are inspired to investigate\nfurther then the elegantly printed\nStrategy document is available from\nyour local Union office. It\u2019s incredible aesthetic qualities are evident\nand the dedicated effort is over-whelming. Hopefully there will soon\nbe a revised \u2018Union Strategy Lite\u2019\nthat serves the same purpose as\nregular Strategy, requires only half\nthe usual rainforest, and doesn\u2019t\ntake hours to decipher \u2013 to express\nyour interest please contact the\nUnion bureaucracy.\nIn the meantime, Professor\nFrankfurt\u2019s tiny publication On\nBullshit should be available from\nmost bookshops, but be prepared\nfor disappointment \u2013 it will be in\nshort supply after last week\u2019s general election.\nA new perspective on Union propaganda\nby THE \u2018MAKE\nPRETENTIOUSNESS\nHISTORY\u2019 COALITION\nCOLUMNS felix@ic.ac.uk\nIs it possible for girls to write\nabout guys without sounding like a\nslut? Is it possible for guys to write\nabout girls without sounding des-perate?\nLet\u2019s look at the evidence. The\nenigmatic Stormy. Is she serious?\nDoes what she write have an ounce\nof truth to it? We shall never know.\nDoes she sound like a slut? Well yes,\nbut to be fair, it\u2019s pretty hard to write\nabout an interesting sex life and not\nsound like a slut. In my opinion, not\nquite as good as Ash last year, but\nstill, after Coffee Break, the Quick\nCrossword, the front page and the\nadverts, it\u2019s the first thing I read in\nFelix.\n(By the way Stormy, dead baby\njokes are funny up until the moment\nyou, or someone you are close to,\nloses a young child).\nThen there\u2019s Diogo\u2019s \u2018Analyse\nThem\u2019. Okay, so stereotyping is\nfun. But self-deprecating the whole\nuniversity is going a bit far. There\nare plenty of nice normal people\nout there, and even the abnormal\nones are nice once you get to know\nthem. And contrary to popular\nbelief, there are loads of really nice\ngirls at Imperial, just waiting to be\nasked out by a talented, interesting Imperial student with massive\nfuture earning potential.\n\u2018The Neighbours Generation\u2019.\nPerhaps I\u2019ve missed something,\nbut what does a \u201850% of kids in\nuniversity\u2019 target have to do with\nNeighbours? Rupert, I\u2019m going to\nmake a suggestion that might help\nyou out, but I don\u2019t want this to be\nmistaken for an indication that I\nlike you. Stop watching TV. Go to the\nUnion. Buy a pretty girl a drink and\nlive happily ever after.\nMy favourite column so far has got\nto be the refreshingly interesting\n\u2018Who am I?\u2019 by Suma Bhattacharya\n[Felix 1321. The follow-up appears\nthis week]. To answer your ques-tion, Wikipedia used to say, \u201cthe\nkey to confidence is knowing that\nyou are who you make yourself out\nto be\u201d. Whoever we are deep down\ninside doesn\u2019t really matter, since\nnobody else gets to see that. People\nsee what we consciously or unconsciously show them, and everyone\nsees things differently, which is why\nyou\u2019ve been accused of being \u201call\nthe pretty colours in the rainbow\u201d.\nSo it would seem that the most\ninteresting columns have been when\npeople write about themselves.\nHowever the most interesting\nthing I did this week was to go\nto a seminar on a compiler framework for thread-level speculation.\nAnd lose money at poker. And get\ndrunk at an empty Union on Friday.\nDiscovered for the first time that\nI have a tankard in the Union Bar,\nwhich I intend to make good use of\nfrom now on. Discovered it leaks.\nTalked to three nice girls, and one\nnot so nice girl.\nYeah, I think maybe I should\nleave columns to other people. But\nlet\u2019s make it interesting. Let\u2019s hear\nabout Imperial life from people living Imperial lives, not from people\nwatching Imperial lives. That\u2019s you,\ndear reader. Got a story to tell?\nLet\u2019s not turn Felix into a blog,\nbut let\u2019s use this Columns section\nfor people to write about life at\nImperial. If enough people do it,\nthen maybe some of it will be good.\nAnd if some of it is good, maybe it\nwill entertain us.\nAnd remember, good writers borrow from others, great writers steal\noutright.\nYou\u2019ve got to be asking yourself\nwhy I told you that...\nComment on columns\nby AARON S\nWhy don\u2019t British universities\nhave fraternities? Should we\nhave them?\nAnyone who has ever watched an\nAmerican teen movie will be well\naware of the US phenomena that\nare fraternities and sororities (the\nfemale equivalent).\nCuriously, considering that they\nare labelled by Greek letters, fraternities have nothing whatsoever to do\nwith the academic legacy of ancient\nGreece. In 1776 student John Heath\nstarted a secret club in which he\nand his friends could discuss the\npressing issues of the day, and he\nnamed this club Phi Beta Kappa.\nFraternities mushroomed from\nthis. Now at least one fraternity is\npresent on most campuses.\nDespite the fact that fraternities\naim to encourage intellectual and\nsocial advancement, they are not\nwholly welcomed by the US educational establishment, who believe\nthey could pose a threat to the power\nof the university.\nFraternities create groups that\ncare for and feel responsible for\neach other, in a manner that is close\nto that of the familial love. This feeling of familial love is surely a benefit when many students are living\naway from home for the first time.\nBut does it take a fraternity system to make students care for one\nanother? Do we in the UK not care\nfor our fellow students if they are\nnot intimately linked to ourselves by\nsuch a system?\nAs we all know, the social aspects\nof life at Imperial are well below\npar. If we had a fraternity-like sys-tem, would Imperial be quite so\nanti-social? I reckon it might help\noil the wheels a little, but the problems with Imperial are so deeply\ningrained it would barely scratch\nthe surface.\nFraternities may spew forth worthy ideals on their aims being \u2018to\nincrease academic achievement\u2019,\nbut I seriously doubt that is why\nthe majority of students join. Frat\nparties have to be the main draw.\nHow many movies have attempted\nto show the sheer drunken debauch-erousness of a frat party? Imperial\nstudents\u2019 house parties can be fun,\nbut they don\u2019t come close to the\nhedonism of fraternity parties.\nThis could be, and most likely\nis, due to the fact that fraternities\ngreatly stack the odds on pulling\nin the fraternity brothers\u2019 favour.\nI\u2019m told that even the ugliest of frat\nbrothers can pull at a frat keg party.\nBut we all know the ratio at Impy\nis ridiculous, and you couldn\u2019t possibly attempt to create an even 50:50\natmosphere.\nThere is a dark side to fraternities \u2013 the intense rivalry that exists\nbetween different frats has lead to\nfeuds reminiscent of gangland dis-putes.\nFrats are also notoriously elitist\nand somewhat uninclusive, notably\npreventing or intimidating gay students and those of different racial\ngroups from joining. They were\nfounded on the basis of religion and\ntoday remain largely religiously\nsecular.\nIn order to join a fraternity,\npeople have to show that they are\n\u2018worthy\u2019 of the privilege. Initiation\nceremonies and hazing (humilia-tion) have been commonplace for\nyears. But recently the nature of\nthe tasks has changed from lighthearted fun to the bizarre and life-threatening.\nWhat was once fun to watch, whilst\nperhaps not so much fun to under-take, has progressed into tasks so\nhumiliating that people have even\ncommitted suicide. Six students\ndied last year as a direct result of\ninitiation ceremonies. Should young\nmen be putting themselves at risk\nof death, just to give themselves a\nsense of belonging in a daunting\nenvironment?\nDespite a university crackdown\non hazing, fraternities appear unde-terred. Some are even considering\nemulating the kind of naked humiliation shown to Iraqi prisoners in\nAbu Ghraib.\nThe influence of fraternities is not\nbound by the walls of the campus.\nFraternities\u2019 power reaches into\nthe outside world. The British \u2018old\nboys\u2019 network is, thankfully, less of\na back door entry into prestigious\njobs than it has been in the past.\nContrastingly, it is not unheard of\nto see directors of major American\ncompanies to be seen exchanging\nsecret handshakes.\nAccording to Forbes magazine,\nover a quarter of CEOs in America\u2019s\ntop 500 companies were fraternity\nmembers. This may sound like a\nsmall proportion, but consider that\nonly 8.5% of university graduates\nare members of a sorority or fra-ternity. The influence of fraternities does not stop with big business\n\u2013 48% of US presidents and 40% of\nthe US Supreme Court justices were\nmembers.\nHave sleeves been banned in\nAustralia?\nI\u2019mwonderingwhetherAustraliahas\nintroduced a ban on guys under 25\nfrom wearing T-shirts with sleeves.\nIf Neighbours is to be viewed as\na true representation of Australia\n(which I believe it most definitely\nis), then one must infer that such a\nlaw has been passed.\nThe Neighbours generation\nby RUPERT NEATE\n\n"

What possible reason\ncould US prosecutors have for withholding evidence from their\nBritish counterparts? Perhaps they know that their evidence\nwould not hold up in a British court.\nBabar Ahmad\u2019s extradition could set an extremely dangerous precedent \u2013 the \u2018one-way\u2019 Extradition Act does not allow\nUS citizens to be extradited to the UK without a case being\npresented, yet this case could open the door for dozens of \u2018terror suspects\u2019 to be sent in the opposite direction. We can only\nlook to the Home Secretary to take a step back, realise the\nabsurdity of the situation, and order that Babar Ahmad be tried\nin Britain or released.\nWhy Southside can\u2019t stay\nIntrusive behaviour\nObsession with someone else can be\nquite healthy if it doesn\u2019t cause problems\nfor you or the other person.

It can also make the person doing\nthe harassment very emotionally dis-tressed.\nWhat is stalking?\nStalking or harassment (continuous\ntormenting) is any form of continued\nunwanted attention, and can happen\nthrough any of the following:\n\u2022 Internet chatrooms\n\u2022 Text messaging\n\u2022 Phone calls\n\u2022 Letters\n\u2022 Personal contact (directly with you, or\nvia your friends and family etc)\n\u2022 Emails\nWho are stalkers?\nStalkers can be people you\u2019ve dated,\npeople you\u2019ve been in a relationship\nwith, or someone you\u2019ve never even met.\nIf you know the person harassing you,\nthat doesn\u2019t give them right to make\nyour life difficult.\nWhat causes stalking?\nThere are many causes that might trigger such behaviour, including:\n\u2022 Many stalkers have psychological\nproblems and may not be able to form\nrelationships in the normal way.\n\u2022 They may convince themselves that\nthey are having a relationship with their\nvictim, or suffer from other delusions\nabout their victim.\n\u2022 They may be an ex who can\u2019t accept\nthat a relationship is over.\n\u2022 Some may be motivated by revenge.\n\u2022 A lot of stalkers believe that that their\nfeelings for their victims are recipro-cated.\nIs the law on my side?\nYes:\n\u2022 The 1997 Protection From Harassment Act makes it a criminal offence for\nanyone to harass another person.\n\u2022 The 1984 Telecommunications Act\nmakes it an offence to send a message that\u2019s offensive or indecent,\nobscene or menacing by a type of public\ntelecommunications system.\nWhat can I do if it happens to\nme?\nFirstly, don\u2019t respond to any messages that you receive, because this may\nonly encourage them to send more.\nDepending on the type of harassment\nyou\u2019re receiving, you can also do a\nnumber of other things:\n\u2022 Report it to the police. Whatever the\nsituation, they\u2019ll listen and advise. In\nextreme cases they can also issue warnings or injuctions.\n\u2022 Tell your phone company. Most phone\nnetworks, whether you have a mobile or\na landline, have a malicious calls policy\nand can give advice to people about\nwhat to do if they\u2019re receiving unwanted\ncalls.\n\u2022 Tell your friends and family. If you\u2019re\ntravelling, make some contingency plans\nto be picked up or meet someone, so that\nyou\u2019re not on your own.\n\u2022 Approach the Information and Advice\nCentre. We can help you. We also have\nclose links with the Student Counselling\nService, which we can refer you to if you\nfeel that something like this is affecting\nyou emotionally.\nRemember that harassment, in any\nform, is not acceptable. It\u2019s not your fault\nand you don\u2019t have to put up with it.\nIf you have been affected by this arti-cle, please do not hesitate to contact the\nIAC on 020 7594 8067 or advice@ic.ac.uk.\nDon\u2019t let your concern turn into a crisis\n\u2013 make the IAC your first port of call.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nAn apology\nFirst off, I ought to apologise for my\nchoice of wording last week. I\u2019ve been\ntold that some readers felt I was accusing\ncustomers and/or staff in the Southside\nBar of racism. I didn\u2019t intend to suggest\neither covert or overt racism and if I gave\nthat impression then I\u2019m sorry I did so.\nI had made a throw-away comment\nabout an observation that others had\nmade to highlight the difficulties of adequately serving student needs when the\ndemographic is changing so markedly.\nMore careful readers would have noticed\nthat I did also say that I felt the Union\u2019s\nown facilities did not do much better.\nWhy can\u2019t Southside bar go into\nthe new building?\nThis is a question I keep getting asked\nand, whilst no-one (sober) has disputed my explanation, they have said that\nI ought to print it. I must admit that\nwhen you\u2019ve known the background for\nmonths it is easy to forget that everyone\nelse doesn\u2019t know the details as well as\nyou do.\nThe basic problem is that Princes\nGardens is in the Knightsbridge conservation area and the existing building\nis Grade II listed by English Heritage.\nThis makes it incredibly difficult to do\nany building work. In order to get permission for demolition, the College had\nto produce an architectural masterplan for \u2018restoring\u2019 Princes Gardens. This\ninvolves replacing the concrete monoliths (Southside and Linstead) with\nbuildings that blend into the Edwardian\nhouses still standing (such as Garden\nHall on the north side).\nThe conservation issues impose practical difficulties. The new Southside will\neffectively have four less floors to be\n\u2018inkeeping\u2019 with the Edwardian houses.\nSomething has to give...\nLet\u2019s look at the priorities. The first is\nbed space. We need more \u2013 student numbers have grown considerably over the\nyears but accommodation has not. The\nplans for Southside will provide around\n70 more beds than at present, utilising every floor other than the ground\nfloor (hardly a great leap forward, but\na welcome step). The second priority is\nthat the Medical Centre has got to be\nhoused somewhere and the only space\nlarge enough is the ground floor of the\nnew Southside. Along with a security\nlodge, that leaves 200 square metres for\na social area/caf\u00e9. That\u2019s not a lot once\nyou include a counter area. There certainly isn\u2019t space for a bar cellar.\nSo what\u2019s wrong with Linstead?\nI\u2019ve said it before \u2013 installing a bar on\nthe first floor would deprive Linstead hall\nof its main private communal space. It\nwouldn\u2019t be a replacement for Southside\nbar \u2013 the area is much smaller and\nsecurity would have policed it tighter\nbecause it overlooked the wealthy neighbours who are influential with the local\ncouncil. So it just wouldn\u2019t have had the\nsame feel.\nYes, I agree that the ground floor shop\nin Linstead is going to be a waste of\nspace. I\u2019ve said it many times to College\nbut they are hell bent on it \u2013 I cynically\nsuspect because they will make a good\ncoffee trade with the building contrac-tors.\nLong term\nNone of this is to say there shouldn\u2019t be\na bar in the long term. The sports centre\ncaf\u00e9 will be licensed. The other new caf\u00e9s\nprobably will be too. And when Linstead\nis finally rebuilt (probably not for a few\nyears whilst the College finds the money)\nthere is space ear-marked for both a\nrestaurant and a bar (and an extra 300\nbed spaces).\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSurvey sends clear\nmessage on campus food\nF\new will have been surprised by the results of last week\u2019s\nsurvey on campus food. The figures send College caterers a clear message: cut your prices and introduce\nhealthier options.\nThere is a large body of evidence showing that what you eat\nhas an enormous impact on your health. So it is entirely plausible to suggest that by providing healthier food, the College can\nimprove exam results and produce happier students who work\nharder. As for the cost, last week\u2019s \u2018price check\u2019 feature showed\nmost local high street outlets to be significantly cheaper than\nthe infamous JCR shop.\nWhat can be done? Well, these issues, like most others, can\nbe raised through the students\u2019 union. You can ask caterers\nwhy they are not providing enough healthy choices. And ulti-mately, you can take your business elsewhere. It might be less\nconvenient, but it might also make a difference to what happens on campus.\nSend us your views: felix@ic.ac.uk.\nPlagiarists must pay penalty\nH\nonest, hard-working students will find few things more\ninfuriating than the small minority who cheat. Many\nat Imperial College can recall moments when, having\nspent countless hours on a piece of coursework to the detriment of the rest of their lives, they notice one of their colleagues\nhastily copying from a friend as the deadline approaches. Same\npiece of work, same grade perhaps, only one of you has put ten\ntimes more thought and effort into it than the other.\nIt can be equally frustrating when such blatant violation of\nthe rules is not punished, and so the chemistry department\nshould be applauded for taking a tough stance on the \u201csignificant amount of plagiarism\u201d amongst third year students.\nIt is regrettable that students have been \u201csent into panic\u201d\nat such a crucial stage of their degrees. More effort should\nhave been made to explain the situation, confirm exactly what\nconstitutes \u2018plagiarism\u2019 and reassure the innocent majority.\nHowever, we are optimistic that the cheats will be outed and\neveryone else will receive their marks on time without any\nfurther inconvenience.\n\n"

Waiting for us on\nthe first day were the winners from the last two years,\nSouthampton and Glasgow.\nWe had Southampton at 4-4\n(matches are best of ten, with\neach of the five players competing in two frames each),\nat which point the valiant\ncaptain ran up against Five\nFlukes Man, who conjured a\nvictory with some unsport-ingly adventitious play.\nWeheldthemightyGlasgow\nto a respectable draw, ending the first day in moderate\nspirits.\nSaturday was the important\nday of jostling and marauding for position in the group\ntable, and first up was the\nEssex delegation, with whom\nwe drew 5-5. Next, and glorious indeed, was a summary\n8-2 demolition of a hapless\nNottingham team who did\nquite well last year.\nBuoyed with confidence and\nmomentum, we ran into York\nwho won 8-2. Nevertheless,\nqualification to the quarter\nfinals was already assured,\nin part because of our solid\nperformance and in part\nthrough the generous system\nwhereby four of the six teams\nin each group got through.\nWaiting for us that evening\n(it had been a long day) were\nthe bibulous Irishmen of\nQueen\u2019s, steeped in history\nand tradition as a team of rare\nquality. Some of that quality\nwas kindly meted out to us in\na 6-3 defeat. Of note, however\nwas a high break of 48 by\nImperial\u2019s Jeremy Brackpool,\nestimated by some observers\nto have taken in excess of an\nhour to compile.\nThus ended our campaign,\nwhich was a more successful\none than in previous years.\nWe have yet to aspire to the\nzenith of Imperial achievement in the early to mid nine-ties, when we actually won\nthe thing, but visitors to the\ntop floor of the Union will\naffirm that the typical contents of the snooker room\nhave recently transanimated\nfrom semi-pros and competent hustlers to vagrants,\nhooligans and a sordid crowd\nof fractured cues, which have\nno place in the procurement\nof champions!\nIn conclusion, we warmly\ninvite you to partake of the\ngame of stick \u2018n ball in our\ngentlemanly atmosphere,\nand to subsequently reach a\nstandard of semi-pro in order\nto wrench back from rival\nuniversities the good name\nof Imperial College (London),\nand also to win the BUSA\nchampionships again!\nThe team was: John Ryan\n(captain, fusspot, and occasional potter of silly balls),\nCalvin Tsang (Prone to pithy\nAnglicisms; he to whom\nthe soft shot is anathema),\nShawn Ow (always likely to\npot something, and mostly\nwith a loud noise), Jeremy\nBrackpool (surprise claimant of the high break, plays\nsnooker too), Lakir Kachhia\n(demoniac at the table;\nangelic at early breakfast)\nand Amar Haria (president,\ncheerleader, personal shopper and VIP).\nSNOOKER\nsnooker too), Lakir Kachhia per and VIP).\nImperial\u2019s snooker team reached the quarter-finals of this year\u2019s BUSA Championship\n\n"

Extreme\nquirkiness and genre hopping is evi-dent, from The Rapture style dance,\nto dense \u201cdeath metal\u201d (their words\nnot mine, more Queens of the Stone\nAge), to a song they call their \u201cpost\nrock epic\u201d, in which a thundering\nbass drum accompanies them seriously abusing a violin and a cello. If\nonly post rock were that fun. Good\neffort, The Chap.\nDANGER: EXTREME VITRIOL\nIN NEXT PARAGRAPH!\nClor are the Do Me Bad Things of\nMTV2-lite punk-funk, ie shit. They\nlook annoying (sunglasses indoors!),\nsound annoying (front man sounds\nlike Brett \u201cI\u2019m not gay\u201d Anderson),\nhave stupid annoying pixelated videos playing behind them, stick annoying light-sabre things in front of the\nstage, and do really annoying \u201crock\u201d\nintros and outros. Some tunes kinda\nmade you want to boogie, but they\nalways managed to turn them into a\npile of guff. The Queens of Noize like\nthem, which should pretty much be\n\u2018nuff said. They do nothing that Le\nTigre, Suede and my Gameboy don\u2019t\ndo 100 times better. Ignore any hype\nyou hear.\nTherefore thank my good friend\nJesus Christ for tiny Tom Vek. A\nbizarre hiccup in the world of sing-er-songwriters, multi-instrumental-ist Tom Vek makes really cool whiteman electro funk, beefed up with\nsome heavy beats and synths. And\nit sounds amazing. He has also rustled up a great band, even though\nthe guitarist looks like The Zipper,\nacts like The Zipper, and has a fash-ion-mullet. Fashion mullets are the\nbiggest crime to the music scene\nsince, well, The Zipper\u2026and Clor.\nThey open on a storming C-C (You\nSet The Fire In Me), with it\u2019s jazzy\ndrums and break beat pauses, and\nfollow it up with a much beefed up\nIf You Want. The biggest surprise\ncomes from the otherwise mediocre\nalbum tracks he plays. They are\ntransformed live into sexy, grinding tunes. The audience was gyrat-ing! The guitar break in If I Had\nChanged My Mind has the crowd\ngo ecstatic, and previously lethargic On The Road and That Can Be\nArranged are seriously and extravagantly overhauled, with heavy guitar\nand spacey atmospherics.\nYou do get the fear he\u2019s going to\nbe a bit pretentious (he was labelled\n\u201cthe saviour of Hoxton\u201d at one\npoint), as many made-it-in-my-shed\nartists are, but nothing could be\nfurther from the truth. He dances\nlike a crazy robot, says \u201cthank you\nvery much\u201d after each song and\ngrins like a monkey. He did a brilliant little speech over his band at\none point, saying \u201cimagine you\u2019re at\na Prince concert, and that my guitarist\u2019s black, and that my drummer\nis a woman and has a see-through\ndrum kit\u201d.\nThere was also an incredible light\nshow. The centrepiece of a glaring\nwhite neon We Have Sound (title\nof his debut album) was flanked on\neither side by mind boggling strips\nof multicoloured LED\u2019s. During\nNothing But Green Lights the band\nwere bathed in a traffic-light green,\nand in Lower The Sun rich yellows,\nreds and oranges lit up the stage.\nMost of the time his band are in\nshadow while Tom is spot lit - it is\nhis show after all!\nUnsurprisingly he finishes (no\nencore from this lad!) with anthem I\nAin\u2019t Saying My Goodbyes. Frankly,\nit was astonishing. Again you would\nnormally get clumsy moshing from\npeople to set closers, but the dance\nfloor was really gettin\u2019 down! So\nthank you Tom Vek for making me\nforget about Clor, and also for making girls dance again. Who knows\nwhere this young musician could\nend up? I urge you to find out,\nbecause I can\u2019t help feeling that it\ncould be one of those \u201cI was there\nfirst\u201d moments. James Millen\nTom Vek / Clor / The Chap\nCamden Lock 17\nHHHHI\nTom Vek: Bite-sized\nALBUM REVIEWS\nNot being a child of the eighties,\nNew Order were always something of a boat that left me on the\nisland. Last Friday\u2019s performance\nof Jetstream (frankly a poor man\u2019s\nVertigo) on Jonathan Ross did little\nto change my mind, although in fairness I can\u2019t think of a single band\nwho has ever sounded their best on\nhis show. However, taking the time\nto listen to the album I find myself\nin the position of being something\nof a convert.\nOpening track Who\u2019s Joe, with its\nstrange electronic galloping beat,\ndramatic little tune and crispy\nvocals, proves that New Order\nmay well have made a not altogether crashing transition into the\nnew school of Keanes. In fact they\nalready seem to be making friends\nin the playground with such counterparts as Scissor Sisters and the\nlovely Gwen Stefani. I Told You So\nis a little too synthetic and Ace of\nBase-esque for my palette, but such\ncrunchy effects find good homes\nelsewhere in Dracula\u2019s Castle and\nthe rather epic Guilt Is A Useless\nEmotion. Ultimately, though, my\nspecial favour is reserved for Turn.\nHidden near the end of the album it\nis clearly heartfelt and to my mind\nrather lovely.\nThe title track sums up this understated album; it\u2019s all about the tunes.\nWell sung, neatly arranged, and nicely appealing to the ear, Waiting For\nThe Sirens\u2019 Call won\u2019t win awards\nfor innovation, but its delicacy and\nattention to detail make it a great\nuplifting collection, perfect for the\nend of term and a summer of doing\nnothing. Alternatively, should you\nprefer to fill your days, New Order\nheadline the Wireless Festival Hyde\nPark on 24 June (tickets available\nfrom the usual outlets), expect at\nthe very least an electric atmos-phere. Giulia Clark\nIt\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that\nNorthamptonshire new wavers The\nDeparture sound really eighties. I\nmean they sound and look like a\ncross between Duran Duran and\nThe Cure, plus they dance like Rick\nAstley. It\u2019s also hard to stop this\ndetracting from the quality of debut\nalbum Dirty Words.\nIt\u2019s an album you can dance to,\nand the singles are indie floor-fillers\nin much the same style as recent\nInterpol releases, but with a flavour\nof British eccentricity (the 80\u2019s were\nall about England). All Mapped Out\nand Be My Enemy are fantastic, as\nmany a DJ has realised. But what\nabout the rest of the album?\nFrom the very outset the album is\nexceedingly cool. Opener Just Like\nTV starts with spacey guitar effects\nbefore launching into trademark\nhigh hat and fast-track guitar lines.\nIt\u2019s not lacking in tunes either, Only\nHuman has a gloriously melodic\nchorus of \u201cI am only human, why do\nyou look at me that way?\u201d suggesting someone has been a naughty\nboy. In fact debauchery springs up\nas a theme a good few times. In All\nMapped Out vocalist David Jones\ndeclares \u201cI see no future in this\u201d,\nand chants \u201cthis dance is just for\ntonight\u201d in his striking tenor voice.\nThis is surprising since he went\nthrough, and advocates strongly, a\nstrict Christian upbringing, including going to a convent school. Cold\nshowers for you, young man!\nThey do seem a bit formulaic in\nplaces, with their distinctive bass\nlines and guitar effects. Tracks such\nas Arms Around Me and Time fade\naway into nothingness for this very\nreason. Luckily for every duff song\nthere\u2019s a gloriously quirky and offbeat Lump In My Throat, or a driving and funky Changing Pilots. The\nalbum also ends on a high, with title\ntrack Dirty Words. Featuring razor-sharp twin guitar lines and a sweeping chorus, it has rightly ascended\nfrom b-side to set closer.\nDirty Words is certainly more\nhit than miss, and has an enviable\namount of fantastic singles for a\ndebut. Steady touring and high profile support slots (Hot Hot Heat, The\nKillers) has built them up a solid fan\nbase ensuring The Departure are\nfive young lads to watch out for.\nJames Millen\nNew Order and new nu-wavers\nNew Order\u2019s new record is sonically conservative but still enjoyable, and the revival of new\nwave continues with yet another \u2018the\u2019 band \u2013 they aren\u2019t half bad, though\nNew Order\nWaiting For The Sirens\u2019 Call\n(London Records)\nHHHII\nThe Departure\nDirty Words\n(Parlophone)\nHHHHI\nNew Order: Who says Manchester is grim?

Joao Medieros\nlooks at the anomaly that may threaten one of the most ancient laws of physics\nPioneer 10 and 11 were two\nof NASA\u2019s most successful\nspace missions of the 1970s.\nLaunched in 1972, Pioneer\n10 was the first spacecraft to\ntravel through the Asteroid\nbelt and the first to obtain\nclose-up images of Jupiter.\nPioneer 11 was launched in\n1974 and went on to make the\nfirst direct observations of\nSaturn in 1979. But there was\nsomething else that made\nthem special: each carried a\ngolden plaque with a message from mankind to alien\ncivilisations.\nThe plaques, for instance,\ndepict our solar system\nand the path followed by\nthe spacecrafts (see image\nbelow). The trajectory shows\ntheir way past Jupiter and out\nof the solar system. However\nunrealistic the aim of contacting aliens may be, there is no\ndoubt of the symbolism. The\nPioneers were the product of\na generation of astronomers\neager to communicate with\nthe cosmos. It now seems that\nthe cosmos has responded in\na surprising way.\nIn 1980, John Anderson, one\nof the leaders of the Pioneer\nteam at the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory (JPL) in\nCalifornia, noticed something\nunexpected. Astronomers\nshould have been able to\nexactly predict the trajectory\nof their spacecrafts by using\nthe standard NewtonianEinsteinian laws of gravity.\nBut Anderson\u2019s calculations\nwere all wrong. The spacecrafts were not where they\nwere supposed to be. It was\nas if they were being slowed\ndown by an unknown, mysterious force.\nAnderson was later joined in\nhis efforts by Michael Martin\nNieto, from the Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory and\nSlava Turyshev, a colleague at\nJPL. Turyshev was one of the\nfirst Soviet scientists to work\nin the United States after the\nCold War. When he first heard\nof the Pioneer anomaly, he\nvolunteered to work on the\nproject for free.\nConvinced that there was\nan error in the way astronomers were calculating the\ntrajectories, Turyshev studied\nmore than 60 possible effects\nthat could cause an abnormal\nreaction in the spacecraft.\nEvery conceivable cause was\ntaken into account, from gas\nleaks to the effect that ocean\nwaves, hitting the shores in\nthe Mojave Desert, had on\nthe radio instruments receiving Pioneer\u2019s transmissions.\nAfter more than a decade of\ncareful analysis, they realised\nthat these effects were not\neven close to explaining the\nPioneer anomaly.\nThe mystery then got even\nmore interesting when similar effects were reported\non two other spacecrafts,\nUlysses and Galileo. How can\nwe explain the same anomaly\noccurring simultaneously in\nfour different spacecrafts?\nThe scientific community was\nnow paying attention.\nToday, an increasing\nnumber of people believe that\nthe Pioneer anomaly could\nactually be a discovery, a very\nbig one. The call for new laws\nof gravity is getting stronger.\nIn fact, a solution may have\nalready been proposed a long\ntime ago. It dates back to 1983,\nwhen Mordehai Milgrom, a\nphysicist at the Weizmann\nInstitute in Israel, first considered a modification to the\nstandard laws of gravity.\nBack then, one of biggest\nriddles in physics was related to the motion of galax-ies. Galaxies were observed\nto be rotating in a way that\nphysicists could not under-stand. Milgrom, using a different law of gravity, was able\nto successfully predict such\nbehaviour.\nNonetheless, his attempt\nwas considered heresy\nagainst one of the most well-established physical theories.\nThe Universal Law of Gravity\nwas first formulated by Isaac\nNewton and had managed\nto describe how the planets\nmoved with one single equa-tion. But in the 17th century,\nNewton knew nothing about\ngalaxies. Stacy McGaugh,\na physics professor at the\nUniversity of Maryland, suggests that Newton would\nprobably be the first to propose a different law if he knew\nthe facts about the galaxies\nas well.\nMilgrom\u2019s theory on galaxies did not predict the Pioneer\nanomaly, but an increasing\nnumber of people feel that\nit may well do so. There are\nalready several proposals\nfor more complete versions\nof modified gravity in which\nthe anomaly is accounted for.\nThere is still a long way to\ngo, though, both in developing\nthe theory and getting atten-tion. \u201cI\u2019m still shocked by how\nso few of us have heard about\nthis theory, let alone know\nanything serious about it,\u201d\nMcGaugh tells us.\nIn the meantime, at the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory,\nTuryshev and his colleagues\nhave initiated the development of a dedicated mission\nto study the Pioneer effect\nand understand the source of\nthe anomaly. Whether it is a\ngas leak or modified gravity,\nTuryshev feels obligated to go\nto the bottom of this. \u201cWhat if\nthis is something that nature\nis telling us?\u201d he asks, \u201cWe\nmust be careful and patient\nto listen and understand what\nwe are being told\u201d.\nSadly, the main characters\nof this story will not be around\nfor its conclusion. NASA has\nreceived its last, very weak,\nsignal from Pioneer 10 in\n2003, and Pioneer 11 sent its\nlast signal in 1995. The spacecrafts are probably plodding\ntheir way into deep space, in a\nway no-one yet understands.\n\u201cIt was as if the\nspacecrafts were being\nslowed down by an\nunknown, mysterious\nforce\u201d\nPioneer 10: not where it should have been according to gravitational theory\nThis week at the Dana Centre\nExpand your mind for FREE.

He/\nshe also calls 24/7 opening \u201ca\nnightmare\u201d that has \u201ctransformed what usually looks\nlike a second rate polytechnic\nlibrary into a total dump\u201d.\nThe mechanical engineering and chemistry department libraries will be transferred to the central library\nthis summer, despite opposition from students.\nRound-the-clock opening\nhours during the summer\nterm were introduced last\nyear, with the strong backing\nof Imperial College Union.\nSir Richard Sykes, the\nRector, told Felix that the\nlibrary is \u201cnot an embarrass-ment, absolutely not. This is\nthe way forward, it has to be\n24 hours a day, seven days a\nweek.\u201d\nHe added that the College\nneeds to transfer \u201cas many\nof the departmental libraries\nas possible\u201d to the central\nlibrary, \u201cbecause you cannot work in a departmental\nlibrary 24 hours a day, 7 days\na week\u201d.\nSam Rorke, Deputy\nPresident (Education and\nWelfare) of Imperial College\nUnion, told Felix: \u201c24 hour\nopening is very popular, but\nthe situation is getting unacceptable as some students\nare finding it difficult to study\nthere.\n\u201cIf you were starting from\nscratch, you wouldn\u2019t create\ndepartmental libraries. The\nmain issue is keeping a reasonable provision of study\nspace in departments.\u201d\nStaff say central library is \u2018an embarrassment\u2019\nBy Dave Edwards\nEditor\nA judge has ruled that Babar\nAhmad, a former Imperial\nCollege student and ICT\nworker, should be extradited to face trial in the United\nStates.\nMr Ahmad, 31, from Tooting,\nstands accused of running\nwebsites to raise funds and\nrecruit new members for\nterrorist organisations in\nChechnya and Afghanistan.\nHis extradition hearing\nbegan in March, but two\nlengthy adjournments were\nmade before the judge gave\nhis ruling on Tuesday morn-ing. Once again, hundreds of\npeople, including a delegation\nfrom Imperial College Union,\nprotested outside the court.\nThe verdict now requires\nfinal approval from Charles\nClarke, the Home Secretary,\nwithin 60 days. Mr Ahmad\nand his supporters are likely\nto appeal against the deci-sion, in which case the matter\nwould be settled by the High\nCourt.\nSenior district judge\nTimothy Workman said that\nthe risk of the death penalty\nwas \u201cnegligible\u201d and that\n\u201cnone of the statutory bars\u201d\nprevented him from allowing\nMr Ahmad\u2019s extradition. The\nImperial alumnus is set to\nbecome the first British citizen to be extradited under a\nnew law that does not require\nUS prosecutors to present\nany evidence against him.\nImperial College Union\nhas been campaigning for\nMr Ahmad\u2019s release since\nDecember. Colin Smith, the\nWelfare Campaigns Officer,\ntold Felix: \u201cObviously it\u2019s a\nsad day, but it\u2019s not over and\nwe\u2019re not going to give up.\nThe Home Secretary still has\nto decide.

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nIt would be a complete shock if this\nalbum wasn\u2019t brilliant. Maximo Park,\nhailing from Newcastle-upon-Tyne,\nare certainly a band on the up. Their\nlatest single, Apply Some Pressure,\nmade it into the top 20, and accolades range from \u201cthe next Franz\nFerdinand\u201d to \u201cthe Futureheads you\ncan shag\u201d. The latter\u2019s not a bad\ncomparison, but perhaps Maximo\nPark possess more pop savvy than\nthe Sunderland lads, hopefully giving them a greater staying power.\nA Certain Trigger is, simply put,\nbrilliant fun from the very beginning\nto the end, packed full of short sharp\npop songs. Ignoring Acrobat, the\nsongs rarely graze three and a half\nminutes and they\u2019re proud to admit\nthey give their audiences just what\nthey want, ie tunes. This desire to\nput on a show explains their incredible stage presence and true musi-cianship.\nThough there is a reasonably rigid\nframework to the structure of the\nsongs (um... except Acrobat), there\nis still plenty of musical scope. You\nwouldn\u2019t expect anything else from a\nband signed to the pioneering Warp\nRecords, normally home to brainy\nIDM (Intelligent Dance Music) art-ists. Graffiti begins with frantic\npsychedelica and screaming organ,\nwhereas The Night I Lost My Head\nis all stop-start rhythms and military\ndrumming. Limasol draws you in\nwith hypnotic synths before bursting\ninto driving new wave, contrasting\nthe sinister vibraphone and tom-tom\nrolls of Once, A Glimpse, which also\nfeatures an intense chorus.\nIt\u2019s amazing to think that singer and co-lyricist Paul Smith was\nthe last addition to the band, as\nhe completely steals the show. He\nsnarls through some tracks such\nas Postcard Of A Painting, exploiting his heavy and rich accent in the\nmelodic Now I\u2019m All Over The Shop.\nThere are brilliant lyrics throughout (er... again forgetting Acrobat),\noften scathingly mocking the sce-nesters and trendies Smith finds\nhimself surrounded by. For example,\nin opener Signal And Sign, he sings,\n\u201cI hope you\u2019ve achieved it all with\nyour lies lies lies lies lies / How long\nhas it taken to look so fine fine fine\nfine fine?\u201d before imploring, \u201cDon\u2019t\nwaste your life, just go outside\u201d.\nThe best track in my opinion is the\nromantic and yearning The Coast Is\nAlways Changing, documenting the\nexcitements and perils of discovering the world. \u201cI am young and I am\nlost / Every sentence has its cost,\u201d\nsnarls Smith, before exclaiming,\n\u201cWe look out across the sea / The\ncoast is always changing.\u201d\nThis is a pretty faultless debut\nother than Acrobat: beginning with\nthe horribly pretentious sound of\npages turning, Smith intones nonsensical spoken word. Musically it\nsounds like the Kevin Shields-heavy\nsoundtrack to Lost In Translation,\nthe kind of stuff shoe-gazers wet\nthemselves over. Only done badly. It\nfinally gives way to a stupidly wobbly\noverwrought chorus: cringe-worthy.\nBut there\u2019s no point boycotting an\nalbum for just one track. A Certain\nTrigger is great fun, clever and witty,\naccessible and just quirky enough. It\nshould sell shed-loads, so get along\nto a live show before they \u201cdo\u201d that\nFranz Ferdinand. James Millen\nTwenty-two-year-old Martin Grech\nis an extremely interesting charac-ter. He was discovered at a young\nage and allowed an amazing three\nyears to complete debut Open Heart\nZoo, released at age 20. He is a man\nwracked with self-doubt; doubt of\nhis music, his voice, the world in\ngeneral. During the recording process he became obsessed with the\nidea that every experience in his life\ncould be split into three categories\n\u2013 Holy, Sensual and Debauched \u2013\nand daubed these motifs across the\nstudio. Desperate to find a way of\nexpressing the troubled ideas in his\nmind he began to pore over the dark\nbiomechanical art of HR Giger, and\nthe disturbing body-part photography of Joel Peter Witkin. Needless\nto say, Keane this ain\u2019t.\nThe opener Guiltless sets the\nmood for the entirety of the album.\nThreatening distorted guitar and\nbass sit low in the mix as Grech\nchants about the human psyche,\npunctuated with horror-film strings\nand dramatic orchestral stabs.\nFollowing this comes Venus, a\nmainly acoustic track that allows\nhis rich voice to flow, before ending\nwith a haunting incantation. Spooky\nvocals are evident throughout the\nrecord, with snippets of laughter\nand conversation flitting in and out,\nand Grech\u2019s unique voice switching\nbetween chanting and truly amazing\nfalsetto.\nThe musical scope is intense\nand the production team are to be\npraised. Electronics, orchestration\nand complex guitar are all executed\nperfectly, switching from the warm\nand uplifting Sun, to the mental I Am\nChromosome. The latter download-only single can only be described\nas a cross between the space age\nsounds of Muse, the shronk rock of\nNIN and the intense speed metal of\nMetallica.\nAlthough the album is far from\neasy listening, I wouldn\u2019t want you\nto believe that it\u2019s particularly hard-going. Many of the tracks, such as\nthe melodic An End, are incredibly\nwarm and uplifting. The twin tracks\nof Lint and Elixir are ghostly and\neffervescent, shimmering lightly\nacross your senses and evoking an\nextreme feeling of calm, before shifting to euphoria as Elixir closes with\na spine-tingling end. It is a rapture\nwhich is dearly welcomed, following the terrifying Worldly Devine,\na track so insistently sinister and\nthreatening that it should come with\na health warning. Unholy pulls you\nalong like a film, completely full of\ndrama, intrigue and sorrow.\nAmazingly, there is another gem\nhidden away in the middle of the\nalbum: the epic (almost ten minutes\nlong!) Holy Father Inferior. After\nfive minutes of dark choirs moaning\nunder his voice you sense a climax,\nand when it comes it is all-consum-ing with its brilliance, as Grech\nscreams unbelievably through the\nupper registers accompanied by\nwhat sounds like a whole army of\ndrummers. Mind-blowing.\nNever have I come across an\nalbum that provokes such emotion before; it truly transports your\nimagination to other (admittedly\ndark) places. The album provides\na perfect dissection of what it is to\nbe human and there really is nothing else that sounds quite like it.\nAbsolute genius. James Millen\nEnter the current Queens website\nand you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking\nyou were experiencing a new media\nversion of some sort of The Ring\nmeets Blair Witch medley. Two\nheaded fairies smoking cigarettes\ndrift across the screen beckoning\n\u201cClick me\u201d, before resting in the\ntwisted forests which occupy the\nscreen... a little scary but then that\u2019s\nnever a bad thing is it?\nMark Lanegan provides the scene\nsetter with his eerie This Lullaby\nlike something an old music box in a\nhaunted attic might produce. From\nhere on in, Lullabies to Paralyze\nprovides 16 tracks which might\ntemptingly be called more of the\nsame \u2013 again not a bad thing, after\nall, if it ain\u2019t broke...\nIn My Head, most recently\nfamous for its Italian porn connec-tion, sounds suspiciously restrained\nuntil you realise you\u2019ve been humming it all day. However this still\nremains the most out of place track\non the album abandoning the echo-ic, chanting, loaded vocals available\nelsewhere. Someone\u2019s in the Wolf is\nmenacing in its ascent and features\nchilly, groaning little voices, the likes\nof which might well be instructing\nyou to kill your elderly neighbour.\nUltimately each song conjures a\nfeeling. Tangled up in Plaid makes\nyou feel like you\u2019ve done something\nbad, and appropriately Long Slow\nGoodbye makes you feel like you got\naway with it. Revealing the darker\nside of fairytales turns Lullabies\ninto more of a listening experi-ence, something which is interesting enough to make you want to\npay attention. What we have here\nis essentially an extremely atmospheric offering which manages all\nthe spookiness of Marilyn and his\ncounterparts with far more subtlety\nand far less showing off.\nGiulia Clark\nStraight outta...

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 19 May 2005\nFILM film.felix@ic.ac.uk\n17\nOng Bak is a martial arts film with\na difference in its making \u2013 the\nfilm\u2019s witty slogan reads: \u201cNo stunt\ndoubles, no computer images, no\nstrings attached.\u201d And if this holds\ntrue, it sure is an amazing piece of\nwork.\nThe film, in Thai with English sub-titles, follows the story of Ting (Jaa),\na villager who travels to Bangkok\nto retrieve the head of his village\u2019s\nBuddha statue from an evil busi-nessman. His travels lead him to\nhis cousin Humlae (Wongkamlao),\nwho has become embroiled in\nBangkok\u2019s unsavoury underworld of\ndrugs, gambling and sex. Humlae\ndecides to help his cousin retrieve\nthe Buddha\u2019s head and this film follows their adventure.\nThe film is littered with typical\nclich\u00e9s about the importance of\nrespect, loyalty, religion and family\nrelationships, but despite this it is\nhugely enjoyable. Maybe because\nthe clich\u00e9s are thrown in with a\nhuge dose of humour and comedic\ndialogue, but also because the film\ncan just... pull it off somehow. Every\nactor delivers a strong performance\n(apart from perhaps Yodkamol\u2019s\ndelivery of Muay, which was very\nover-the-top and slightly unbearable at times) and the settings are\nperfect in bringing the script to life\nas we fluctuate from smoky drug-den-cum-wrestling-arena to hidden\nmountain caverns.\nThe main thing that was impressive about this film were the fight\nscenes \u2013 and were they something\nto behold. Although the film boasts\nthat all of the fighting and action\nsequencesweredonewithoutstrings\nand stunt doubles (some stunts\nwere shown two or three times from\ndifferent camera angles to prove\nthis), it made the actual fighting no\nless plausible \u2013 expect much of the\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragonesque scenes of incredible jumps,\nleaps and kicks. What really brought\nthe fight scenes together and made\nthem so enjoyable, however, was the\nhumour that was weaved throughout the whole sequence \u2013 at several points throughout the movie,\nthe entire audience in the cinema\nwere loudly laughing as the fight\nscene unfolded on screen. Despite\nthe blatant impossibility of it all, it is\ngenuinely enjoyable to watch once\nyou realise that the film is not taking\nitself entirely seriously either.\nThe well-crafted fight scenes\nhad some trademarks reminiscent\nof both Jackie Chan and Jet Li,\nemploying the flexibility and the\nsuaveness of the former and the\ndeftness and killer moves of the lat-ter. However, instead of gracefully\nlethal Wu-Shu or Shaolin Kung Fu\nfighting, we see the rawness and\nenergy behind Muay Thai (Thai\nkickboxing) which is an interesting\nvariation but may just get a little\ntoo much for your liking. Although\nmost of the fight scenes were highly\nentertaining to watch, there is only\nso much relentless Thai kickboxing\nyou can see before you start to get\na little bored, and the fact that the\ncharacter development of the main\nstar seemed to lag a little did not\nhelp matters \u2013 Ting seemed far too\nnoble for any hero and although his\nsincerity was supposed to be inspir-ing, it was actually rather corny.\nOverall, though, this film was definitely an enjoyable one to watch \u2013 I\nwould highly recommend it to any\nJackie Chan or Jet Li fan or someone who enjoys films with plenty of\nmeaty fight scenes. In fact, I\u2019d recommend it to anyone who is up for a\nlaugh \u2013 this film certainly had me in\nfits of laughter throughout.\nMarya Ziauddin\nQuality scraps\nMore Asian extreme fun\nOng Bak the Thai Warrior\nDirector: Prachya Pinkaew\nStarring: Tony Jaa, Petchtai\nWongkamlao, Pumwaree\nYodkamol, Suchao Pongwilai\nLength: 109 minutes\nCertificate: 18\nHHHHI\nTony Jaa kicks some ass\n\u201cI\u2019d recommend it to\nanyone who is up for\na laugh \u2013 this film\ncertainly had me in\nfits throughout\u201d\nOUT\nNEXT\nWEEK\nReleased on Thursday 19 May at\nVue Fulham Broadway:\n\u25cf Star Wars\nEpisode III:\nRevenge of the Sith\nVisit www.myvue.com/student for\nmore details.\nLast week\u2019s winners of the Star\nWars t-shirts and poster were\nMartin Smith, Vinod Aravind\nMuganthan and Ben Murdoch.\nTim Aplin, Ryan Dee, Jerome\nMa, Marco Visentini, Andreas\nLiapis, Kriangkrai Arunotayanun\nand Rafael Gates have all won\nposters. Alan Ng\nFilm Editor\nHelen Hunt plays the scarlet woman\nMrs Erlynne, who wrecks happy\nhouseholds by sleeping with people\u2019s husbands for money. When\nshe realises that her game is up\nin New York, she leaves for Italy\nwhere her life becomes intertwined\nwith the Windermere couple. Lord\nWindermere and Lady Windermere\n(Scarlett Johansson) are the golden\ncouple of the town; married only\nfor a year, they are still apparently\nvery much in love with each other.\nHowever, their marriage becomes\ncomplicated with the arrival of Mrs\nErlynne and Lord Darlington.\nLord Darlington, an international playboy, is attracted to Lady\nWindermere\u2019s innocence and naive-ty, so he decides to steal her from\nher husband. Lady Windermere,\ninnocent to a fault, misjudges Lord\nDarlington\u2019sintentionsanddecidesto\nmakehimherfriend.Simultaneously,\nMrs Erlynne has a chance encounter with Lord Windermere in an\nantique store. After this encounter,\nLord Windermere is spotted visiting\nMrs Erlynne every day by the local\ngossip lady, Lady Plymdale (Diana\nHardcastle). Lord Darlington, ever\nthe opportunist, uses this information to instil seeds of doubt in Lady\nWindermere\u2019s mind about her hus-band. With his help, she discovers\nthat her husband has been giving\nMrs Erlynne a huge sum of money\nand jumps to the conclusion that her\nhusband has been unfaithful. Lady\nWindermere is now thrown into a\ndilemma as she realizes that her\nhusband and her marriage were not\nwhat it seems.\nFirst and foremost, this movie\nis an adaptation of the play Lady\nWindermere\u2019s Fan by Oscar Wilde.\nTherefore, it is not a surprise that the\nplot was par excellence. With Oscar\nWilde, you realise that nothing is\never a coincidence and that nothing\nis ever what it seems. However, the\nscriptwriters still have to be credited\nfor adapting the play into the movie\nwithout destroying the play\u2019s excellent points. It is an achievement that\nnot many adaptations (ahem... such\nas Harry Potter) can crow about.\nThe decision to have the story take\nplace in Italy instead of London is\nalso a welcome improvement to the\nmovie. It helps create a more picturesque and surreal atmosphere\nthat makes the viewing experience\na more enjoyable one.\nHowever, the actors\u2019 performances still had room for improvement\neven though experienced actresses were chosen for the lead roles.\nJohansson is far from comfortable\nin her role as the sweet and innocent Lady Windermere. However, it\ncould be argued that her awkwardness is a method of demonstrating\nLady Windermere\u2019s naivety.\nHelen Hunt did not give a convincing portrait of a seductress, but sur-prisingly, as the story progresses,\nshe does manage to become a bitterly misunderstood Mrs Erlynne.\nNevertheless, the most disappointing act in the whole movie was that\nof Stephen Campbell Moore as Lord\nDarlington. Not only did he lack the\nlooks expected of an international\nplayboy, he was simply not suave\nenough to convince viewers that\nhe could steal Lady Windermere\u2019s\nheart. It is especially unbelievable when Lord Windermere (Mark\nUmbers) has wholesome American\ngood looks.\nOverall, A Good Woman is a thoroughly engaging movie despite its\nshortcomings. It is an enjoyable film\nthat helps the audience to learn\nsome life lessons as well. These life\nlessons include the value of trust in\na loved one, the wisdom of not allowing imperfections to affect one\u2019s otherwise perfect relationship, and the\nvalue of pride over love. Therefore,\nA Good Woman is a very much recommended watch, not just for Oscar\nWilde fans but for everyone who is\nlooking for a movie that has both\nmeaning and entertainment value in\ntoday\u2019s superficial film industry.\nAngela Lee\nGood Woman, good film\nA Good Woman\nDirector: Mike Barker\nStarring: Helen Hunt, Scarlett\nJohansson, Tom Wilkinson\nLength: 93 minutes\nCertificate: PG\nHHHHI\n\u201cA movie that has\nboth meaning and\nentertainment value\nin today\u2019s superficial\nfilm industry\u201d\nA good woman?

I\ndidn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t want to talk about\nit.\nOK, maybe I do. I spent most of my\nholiday in the hospital with a broken jaw, three fractured ribs and a\nseverely bruised ego. All I was trying\nto do was help a poor drowning girl\nby giving her CPR, Hoff-style. Her\nboyfriend wasn\u2019t too pleased with\nmy first aid technique (tongues) and\ndecided to take on The Hoff. I tried\nto explain it to him: \u2018This is standard\nBaywatch procedure, I\u2019m the hero,\nshe\u2019s the big-breasted tart who\u2019s\nbeen bitten by a shark/pirate/rebel\nlifeguard, and you\u2019re the dim-witted,\nmildly retarded, redneck boyfriend.\nYou let me do my job, and I\u2019ll let you\ndo whatever menial, life-sapping job\nyou do.

I don\u2019t remember much before or during either,\nas I was steaming drunk after my\nChampagne breakfast, Daiquiri\nlunch, and Methylated dinner. I\u2019d\nasked that senile old queen KITT\nto drive me to the beach for a little\n\u2018Baywatching\u2019 (advantages of having a robot car) but as the redneck\nbegan crushing my windpipe, I was\nstarting to think it was possibly a\nbad idea, especially if the beach\nis full of lantern-jawed idiots who\nwon\u2019t let me help out their attractive\nyoung girlfriends.\nIt was then that I made a vow: No\nmore Mr Nice Guy.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 19 May 2005\n8\nColumns felix@ic.ac.uk\nMuch has happened since we last\nmet. So much so, that I\u2019ll just give a\npassing apologetic nod to those who\nwere offended by my unintentionally unfair castigation of the Arab\ngentleman on the 211 bus the other\nweek and move on to bigger and\nbetter things.\nSuch as my proposition from the\nlovely Mr Geraldes. Diogo, I would\nbe delighted to take you up on your\noffer on the proviso that we go out\nfor a coffee and get to know each\nother\u2019s likes and dislikes before\ndoing the vertical and possibly the\nhorizontal together. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d\nhate to find yourself in a disastrous\nsituation where the action above the\nwaist ends up being infinitely superior to that below, hence testing an\nadmirer out on the dancefloor is the\nonly way forward!\nLatino lovers aside, the love life\nhas been on the up. Not only was I\nasked out by a Springbok chemical\nengineering lecturer in Sainsbury\u2019s\nLocal on Fulham Palace Road, but\nI\u2019ve also been ambushed by various\ntramps whilst trying to further my\nway towards academic success in\nthe library.\nStormy, in the library? I regret to\nconfirm this is so, since my laptop\nexploded due to excessive \u2018rightclick collecting\u2019 of numerous per-vables, the latest being the unadulterated testosterone of Rog from\nNowhere Near the Garden. Nick\nfrom Rooster should really get over\nhimself \u2013 Rog doesn\u2019t need to watch\nBon Jovi and Rolling Stones videos\nto create a stage show worth its salt.\nBesides Nick, Luke (an ex-LSE stu-dent) is fitter than you anyway.\nAnd what do I find in the library?\nNone other than all the stalkers I\u2019d\nrather not see. There\u2019s Spotty, the\nowner of an impressive hentai col-lection; Greasy, also known as the\npermanently stoned medic with the\nfledgling metal band; and Oxbridge\nGuy.\nOxbridge Guy creeps the entire\nmedical school out the most \u2013 his\npervy grin, thirties glasses, Peter\nStringfellow hair and surgically-attached best mate with the prosthetic limb fetish and chauvinistic\nviews leave a lot to be desired.\nImagine my disgust when he decides\nto announce his lust for Imperial\nwomen to a computer room containing me and a group of second year\nsurfers. I narrowly escaped puking\nover my keyboard when he fixed his\ngaze at me, and I ended up setting\noff the fire alarm whilst making a\nswift getaway. Irresponsible, I real-ise, but you\u2019d do it too if an unwanted\nadmirer tried to use his Cambridge\ncufflinks as a chat-up line.\nIt\u2019s not just Charing Cross library\nthat attracts losers though. The sci-fi\nand central libraries do too. Central\nhas it\u2019s own \u2018loin-man\u2019, who walks\npast ladies taking a respite from the\nsummer heat and, on making con-versation, ends up asking whether\nthey would like to feel something\nhot. When questioned further, he\nreveals that his loins are the item\nof relevance. Needless to say, he,\nand the rest of civil engineering,\nhave managed to win themselves\nthe title of \u2018Least Sexy Department\u2019\nin my books. Whilst being aesthetically tolerable, their arrogance is\nmind-numbing to say the least.\nSci-fi are, on the other hand, at\none with their shortcomings, and\ntry their best to over-compen-sate for their ugliness by treating\ntheir ladies like princesses. They\ncome perilously close to winning\nthe \u2018Least Sexy Society\u2019 prize, with\nonly Micro Club and the blue-haired\nMech Eng self-appreciation society beating them to it! Arrogance is\nunattractive, but vanity is seriously\nflawed.\nI digress. The point of this column\nwas to accentuate the positive, the\npositives being that I have managed\nto get a first on the presentation\nwith Birkenstock woman and that\nthe Jeff Hardy lookalike I almost\nran over on Chiswick High Road has\nbeen keeping me happily occupied\non Sundays. Living anatomy is the\nbest lesson ever \u2013 and regular tutorials keep me very happy...\nThe girl about town\nby STORMY WOODS\nDo you know that Akhenaton was\nthe first monotheist in history? And\nthat 22 kids have been executed in\nUSA since 1976?\nOK! Now that I\u2019ve written something smart and interesting, I can\nproceed to my usual \u201ctaking the\npiss\u201d style without having any complaints about how my articles are so\nlame and uncultural.\nThis week\u2019s column is about life in\nhalls. Or maybe that should be \u2018life\nin hall\u2019, because I\u2019ve only lived in one\n(and I can\u2019t mention it because that\nwould promote WILSON HOUSE\nmore than the others!)\nAnyway, life in halls can be divided\nin the following sections:\n1. Parties\n2. Studying (actually no... who am\nI trying to convince that your first\nyear is dedicated to studying? Let\u2019s\nmake it parties again and keep on\nmoving)\n3. Hall events\n4. Living away from home\n5. Living in society\n6. Reapps and wardens\n1 and 2. Parties\nFrom freshers\u2019 nights out and birthday orgies, to halloween and ran-dom-parties-without-any-special-meaning, there\u2019s a whole range of\nopportunities for you to get wasted\nand finally pull the ugly-girl-from-the-floor-above-who-turns-you-on.\nI\u2019ve seen people arriving completely on fire and horny (rolling and\nhugging on the floor is one exam-ple), throwing up in a bin or in some\nrandom guys room, on a free ambulance ride or escorted by policemen,\ncarrying wooden tables or traffic\nsigns, spreading their dinner all over\nthe common rooms and buses... and\ni could go on for a couple more lines,\nbut that would make you envious.\nThis is basically what life in halls\nis about: party as if tomorrow is the\nfinal judgement day!\n3. Hall events\nHall events are great because they\ngive all the new students the opportunity to mingle together, promote\ncultural, social, sporty and cheap\ndays around London and make you\nforget everything about where you\ncame from.\nThere\u2019s nothing better than waking\nup at five in the morning and crossing England by train to roll for the\nwhole day on mud and rocks, shoot\nyour mates and return straight to St\nMary\u2019s Hospital with hypothermia\nand bruises on parts of your body\nyou didn\u2019t even know existed (that\u2019s\npaintballing, in case you are reading\nthis in your 24/7 study break in the\nlibrary)!\n4. Living away from home\nAfter the first month of events and\nmeeting new people, you finally discover that the smell in your room\ndoesn\u2019t come from the corpse hidden under your mattress, but from\nyour pile of clothes. Now there\u2019s no\nmummy to help you!\nYou also realise that a balanced\ndiet definitely does not contain pizza\nand shawarma and have to start\nto learn how to cook, even if that\nimplies burning down the house,\ngetting stomach cancer or finding\nsomeone to be your bitch and wait\nfor you to get back from college to\ncook your stir fry.\nThere\u2019s also the continuous fight\nagainst the second law of thermodynamics that makes your room look\nlike a battlefield where you can only\nwalk with food provisions for a week\nand ammunition, just in case you\nget lost.\nWho said there\u2019s nothing better\nthan living alone?\n5. Living in society\nThis topic only applies to medics\nand 3% of other students (the ones\nwho dont care about their degree\nand who might be reading this masterpiece of litherature). If you feel\nthat somehow you are not included\nin this group, I\u2019d like to introduce\nyou to a couple of key concepts: SOCI-E-TY and interacting with other\npeople!\nStaying in your room, eating you\nmicrowaveable rice or noodles while\nironing your underwear or programing Sudoku in your calculator is not\nsociable! (I find that the simple\nappearance of Sudoku in my article\nmight raise the number of readers\nby 50%, from 2 to 3. No, mum, you\ndont count!)\n6. Reapps and wardens\nI was going to write a whole article\nabout this, but I think my opinion on\nthem (whether they are sporty, sick\nmixers, nature loving, nightwalkers,\nparty people, drunk or married \u2013 and\nim definitely not licking arses for my\nnext year as reapp) can be summed\nup in three little words: WE LOVE\nYOU!\nSo, life in halls can be amazing and\nexciting for sure, if you put some\n(little) effort into it. This year has\nbeen a great experience for me and\nI would like to thank everyone that\nparticipates in it for making my life\nwithout a beach, fit chicks, cheap\nalcohol, sunny weather, my own car,\nmy best friends, my family and good\nfood much easier than I expected!\nAnalyse them\nby DIOGO GERALDES\nThe question \u201cwhy?\u201d is just like\na balloon floating forever with no\ndestination or string to hold it with.\nWhat I mean is that I don\u2019t have a\nclue why. I am humbled because I\ndon\u2019t know, and I am empowered\nbecause I can still ask. Really, what\nis the point of either a music degree\nor a mathematics degree, other than\nto ultimately discover the right to\nask any question you want? Surely\neducation is about asking the question and believing in the right to\ndo so, without needing a validation\nthrough the promise of an answer.\nI find it quite amazing, you know,\nlooking at a baby and realising she\nhas absolutely no idea. She doesn\u2019t\nknow what to think, what to do or\nwho to be. Suddenly she pops into\nexistence and consciousness with\nsuch a clean slate \u2013 only to face six\nbillion pre-existing ideas as to who\nshe already is. Then it is just a matter of fulfilling that role.\nI know I am kind of ignoring the\ngenome here, but rightly so. You see,\nworse than just that child drowning\nin those six billion (and growing)\nexpectations and having her future\noutweighed by too heavy a history,\nthe real tragedy lies in the child\nbeing given the answers even before\nshe understands how to ask the\nquestions. Every generation lives in\nthe knowledge of undeniable truths\n(the world was undoubtedly flat for\na very long time), which are only to\nbe disproved in the face of advance-ment. There are so many things\nwe take for granted that will cause\nsilly brats of the future to sit in their\njunior schools and giggle uncontrollably at our stupidity!\nIn that sense, there is only one\nthing we can be certain of, if we were\nto learn a lesson from history: there\nare a significant number of \u201ctruths\u201d\nthat we take for granted and can\u2019t\nargue against now, that will eventually be discarded as myths at some\npoint in the future. So before you\nknow it, our little girl shuts up very\ncontent to have found all the light\nshe needs and the world remains\na constant \u2013 lit by the past and all\nthose precious truths we must all\nsuccumb to.\nIf only we had the profound means\nof understanding through our limited minds, that in fact, all our life is\njust a confinement of our unlimited\nmind, then we could really appreciate how frighteningly beautiful it is,\nnot to know. So, I proudly exclaim, I\nhave no idea!\nWhy?\nby SUMA BHATTACHARYA\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 19 May 2005 7\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nLibrary crisis\nDear Dave,\nYourreportoftheclosureoftheMech\nEng library (Felix, 5 May), worrying\nas it is for hundreds of students\nof that department, barely reveals\nthe tip of an iceberg which should\nbe a much greater worry for all IC\nstudents. It is apparently the aim of\nIC to cram yet more departmental\nlibraries plus their users into the\ncentral library (chemistry is moving\nthis summer). Coincidentally, the\ngreat and good within IC (led by the\nCollege\u2019s Estates Dept, itself heavily influenced by the Rector) have\ntheir eyes on Level 5 of the Central\nLibrary, chiefly for admin purposes.\nSo how many quarts can you get into\na pint pot without withdrawing huge\namounts of stock (which is exactly\nwhat is happening and is planned\nto happen via much more off-site\nstorage at Wye) and by treating the\nScience Museum Library in such\na cavalier fashion that it is likely\nto be forced out altogether? Allied\nto this is a report by IC\u2019s head of\nlibrary services assessing the 10\nyears ahead. It assumes that electronic resources and services will be\ninvested in so heavily that current\nstock (ie books and periodicals) will\nbe steadily reduced throughout that\nperiod.\nSo who constitute this \u2018Council of\nprofessors\u2019 [running the mechanical engineering department]? How\nmany ever visit and use the central\nlibrary? If any did they would surely\nhave commented on the nightmare\nthat 24/7 opening has caused. This\npolicy has transformed what usually\nlooks like a second rate polytechnic\nlibrary into a total dump. Few IC\nlibrarians are findable by students;\nwe\u2019re all now stuck together in one\nmassive backroom office from which\nfew are allowed out. Students report\nthat much is not findable on shelves.\nThe library has become an embar-rassment. So students should treat\nstatements implying that senior\ndecisions are made in their \u201cbest\ninterests\u201d with the contempt they\ndeserve. IC has a very clear agen-da, one which very definitely puts\nfinances before education. How students react could well save or lose\nlibrary facilities for a generation.\nFrom a central library librarian\nSouthside Bar\nDear Felix Ed,\nOne should never write in anger, or\nso I have been told, so maybe this is\nan ill-advised letter, but sometimes\nyou wait and wait and wait some\nmore and still the anger remains.\nSo you write a letter.\nI could be angry because Southside\nis about to close and will not be\nreplaced. I could be angry because\nthis decision was taken without any\nconsultation with the people primarily concerned. I could be angry\nbecause 35 people, most of them\nstudents, and a lot of them in need\nof the income in a time of top-up\nfees, will lose an opportunity. I could\nbe angry because a place that has\nwon a dozen awards over the past\nfour years, which is packed full most\nof the week and whose closure has\nelicited quite an emotional response\nhas been described as part of the\n\u201csurcapacity in bars at Imperial\u201d.\nI could also be angry, to be honest,\nfor personal reasons: 8 years spent\nat Imperial left me with quite a few\nfriends and good memories.\nI could, and I was, angry for all\nthese reasons, but I discovered new\nreserves of anger last week when,\nin these pages, Southside Bar was\ndescribed as \u201cwhite, British, middle class\u201d [State of the Union, Felix\n1322].\nThat was a remarkably cheap\nshot. The truth is obviously differ-ent: given the nature of Imperial\u2019s\nstudent population today, Southside\nwouldn\u2019t stand a chance of surviv-ing, let alone turning a profit \u2013 which\nit does \u2013 without appealing to the\nwhole of the student body... as Mr\nArif would have found out, had he\never taken the time to come down to\nPrince\u2019s Gardens.\nI am certainly not saying that we\nare without faults and, yes, the place\ncan still appear intimidating to some\non a sport night, although we have\ntaken steps to curb this problem in\nthe last few years (notably the sing-ing, just ask the members of the IC\nfootball teams with whom my personal ratings must be this year at an\nall-time low...) Nonetheless, I cannot\nhelp but think that, if the Union\nmanagement had concerns with this\nissue, they would have been better\nadvised to try and find a solution\nwith us instead of having us close\naltogether (along with Linstead\u2019s\nand Weeks\u2019 bars, even if they have\nbeen barely mentioned so far).\nUltimately a bar is an empty shell,\nwe do what we can to make the place\na welcoming one but we can only\nsmile that much. What we do is try\nand, if I can judge by the diversity of\nour customers, succeed in catering\nto (nearly) everyone whatever their\nrequirements, be it a full-length session or just a couple of drinks. To\naccuse us of covert racism is not\nonly cheap and craven, it also flies in\nthe face of all my experience; our TV\nlounge is more packed, a lot more,\nwhen India plays Pakistan than during the Ashes!\nThis working class Frenchman\nhas been accused of a lot of things in\nhis time but being part of the white,\nBritish, middle class establishment\nis a novel experience.\nRegards,\nArnaud Schmolinski\nSouthside Bar\nI\u2019m constantly amazed by comments\nMr Arif makes about Southside\nbar. Despite the so called \u2018falling\ndemand\u2019, Southside is popular with\nstudents and staff alike, and has\nwon numerous awards, while the\nUnion bar doesn\u2019t come anywhere\nclose.\nIf this is an attempt to increase\nthe number of people going to the\nUnion, then I believe it will end in\nfailure as I, for one, and most people\nI know will simply choose not to go\ndrinking anywhere in college rather\nthan face the union.\nI was very much looking forward to a new temporary bar in\nLinstead, and if the dining area is\nto be removed to make space for a\nshop and cafe, then the \u2018communal\narea\u2019 which seems to worry Mr Arif\nso much will dissapear anyway.\nIt seems that once again Mr Arif\nhas made a decision \u2018in the interest\nof students\u2019 without actually consulting any of them.\nSem\nNomination time\nDear Felix,\nWith the Union\u2019s Colours coming\nup, we felt the urge to nominate\nan individual who we feel is currently doing a major service to the\nUnion and College in general; a surprisingly large number of people\nseem to think that his is a redundant\npresence, bend on estranging students and being the College administration\u2019s errand boy; we will set\nout however, hoping to prove these\nCassandras wrong.\nWhat has that extraordinary individual achieved so far? The list is\nnever-ending, but with the utmost\nrespect to your paper\u2019s space, it will\nbe kept short.\n1) Bullying over Choice: When\nGreece won the European Cup last\nsummer, we were unsure whether\nwe were more jubilant about not\never having to go to DaVinci\u2019s again\n(it being the \u201cvenue\u201d where we\nwatched the majority of matches),\nor about our victory per se. Let me\ntell you, that place is GRIM. Being\nRSM, it admittedly feels less uncomfortable in the Union Bar (what with\nthe Bottle and all); DaVinci\u2019s how-ever, and that dB\u2019s place (with the\nobscure events that seem to take\nplace there) are really a disgrace.\n2) Illusions of grandeur and actual\npower: \u201cwhen I met College officials...\u201d, \u201cI could either choose...\u201d, \u201cI\nhad to choose the hall bar closure\noption\u201d ... it does get nauseating, so\nwe stop. The man seems to think\nhe is actually running the place!\nWe have never felt comfortable with\nthe primitive, semi-authoritarian\npersonality cults that have inundated public life; when associated\nwith people who hold absolutely no\npower whatsoever, it truly becomes\nunbearable. Someone has to tell him\nto just continue bowing his head\nto whatever directives he receives\nfrom College, or actually emerge\nfrom his spineless state and stand\nup for the issues that truly matter\nto students.\n3) Inclinations to political-cor-rectness: the last thing you would\nexpect from a student member of\na research-led scientific institution\nlike the one we believe we are attend-ing, would be for them to fall for the\ncheap rhetoric of the PC crowd; and\nnot feeling guilty, as our candidate\ndoes, when College-outsiders point\nout the prevalence of white, middle-class students in Southside... reviled\nwhite, middle-class people, after all,\nhave much better ways of channelling their spending power than\nbeing stuck in an underground hole,\nhaggling over a pint of Carling for\n\u00a31.53...\nOn top of the aforementioned con-tributions, we are eagerly awaiting\nour nominated individual\u2019s efforts\nto provide to \u201can ever changing student demographic... a social space\nthat appeals to all\u201d. The absurdity\nof his own thought doesn\u2019t seem to\ntrouble him, yet he goes on ranting\non the need to accommodate every\nsingle need of a, largely imaginary,\ncosmopolitan student body... Surely\nit can only be a good thing that these\nmaximalist fantasies are the only\nremotely political aspect of this person\u2019s meddling in our affairs.\nEagerly awaiting the due recognition our candidate for Union Colours\ndeserves.\nYours truly,\nIoannis Fourniadis\nPhD Earth Science & Engineering\nSleepy security\nDear Mr Editor,\nIn response to your article about\nsecurity in the last issue of Felix:\nThis evening I went to the security lodge in Beit at about 1am, for\nwhatever reason it doesn\u2019t matter.\nThe guard was asleep, even to the\npoint where he had turned all the\nlights off! I managed to wake him up,\nfinished my business there and went\nto Sherfield to inform them of the\nsituation, and was basically pooh-poohed and told to go away.\nHow, exactly, are we supposed to\nbelieve that security are \u201cthere to\nhelp us\u201d when they are asleep, or\nrude?\nYours\nName and department supplied\nAnalysing the analyst\nDear Editor,\nAfter reading this week\u2019s column\npenned by Mr Geraldes [Anaylse\nthem, issue 1322], I became rather\nperplexed as to the source of the\nauthor\u2019s knowledge on sports for\n\u2018rich boys\u2019. Mr Geraldes seemed to\nbe under the impression that the\nfavoured sports of those born with\na \u2018golden\u2019 (silver, surely...) spoon in\ntheir mouths were rather obscure\nand exclusive. This may well be true,\nhowever, I wonder if Mr Geraldes\nreally considers \u2018golf, fencing or\ncricket\u2019 to be good examples of such\nsports.\nIn his definition Mr Geraldes suggests that these are examples of\n\u2018sports that no-one knows how to\nplay or that they even exist\u2019. I suspect the more likely case is that\nthese sports exemplify those to\nwhich Mr Geraldes is ignorant of,\nsince a quick look at viewing figures\nwould demonstrate that several million viewers tune in to watch Test\nMatch cricket or The Masters (that\nis a golf tournament for the benefit\nof Mr Geraldes).\nI might suggest therefore that\nMr Geraldes borrows a copy of the\nPenguin Guide to Sports for primary school children and looks up\nthe relevant sports. Perhaps a better selection of sports might have\nincluded \u2018The Eton Wall Game\u2019 or\npossibly \u2018Croquet\u2019. Clearly though,\nsince Mr Geraldes was not born\nwith any cutlery in his mouth of any\ndescription, these sports are likely\nto be way outside his own sphere of\ninfluence.\nRegards,\nName and department supplied\nDiogo Geraldes replies:\nAs anyone with two heart pulses\nper minute and half a brain can\nsee, my articles are written in a\nsarcastic way and are not to be\ntaken seriously.\nI\u2019ve realised that, for some people in this college, a good sense of\nhumour is not a common charac-teristic. They take life too seriously.\nWhat is scary is that we are students and need to relax and enjoy it\na bit before diving into the stressful\nworking world.\nIf you actually felt offended by\nan opinion column (where I made\nfun of almost every sport at IC\n\u2013 even the ones I play), you are the\none who needs professional advice\nand to learn about a thing called\nIRONY.\nPS By the way, just because a\nsport is well known here in the UK,\nthat doesn\u2019t actually make it easy\nto understand for people that come\nfrom other countries. After all, we\nlive in a multi-cultural society and\nneed to respect other people\u2019s ways\nof thinking and viewing the world.\nI would also like to quote a paragraph from my first Felix column:\n\u201cIf you took this article too person-ally, I would recommend you get\na life! (You can start by buying a\nsense of humour!)\u201d\n\u20184th floor library dude\u2019\nDear Editor,\nDuring the past few months details\nhave been revealed in the press of\nlying and corruption in the intelligence services leading up to the\nwar in Iraq. Judging by the fraudulent coverage of activities on the\n4th floor of the library, I\u2019m surprised\nRupert Neate didn\u2019t find any weapons of mass destruction as well as\na \u20184th floor library dude\u2019. I expect a\nposition in the MI5 is waiting for him\nwhen he eventually graduates.\nI do hope when he takes time off\nfrom spying he has time to revise for\nhis exams so as to not be... a joke...?\nThe very best of luck in becoming\neditor. Thankfully, I\u2019ll be graduating\nthis summer so I won\u2019t have to see\nFelix in hot competition with the\nSun and the Mirror in the tabloid\nstakes.\nUgochi Anomelechi\nRupert Neate replies:\nDear Ugochi Anomelechi,\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve worked out it\nwas you I was talking about. The\nvery fact that you have managed to\nidentify yourself from my description shows that the description\nwas accurate. I hope that now you\nhave realised how annoying your\nbehaviour can be to the majority\nof library users, you will curtail it.\nThanks for the vote of confidence\nthat you think Felix will by vying\nwith mass market tabloids.\nSend your letters to felix@ic.ac.uk by 10pm Monday. Letters may be edited for length but not for spelling or grammar, and are printed at the Editor\u2019s discretion\nLetters to\nthe Editor\n\n"
