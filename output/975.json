    "content": "24 Feature\nFive Bands. Five Days, Two Nights\nThat was the Freshers' week that was. Whilst Owain swan ned lyrically\naround the bar, Tintin babbled dysfunction ally into his Beamish. Bouncing\nboldly off the back of the attending NME journ os, they slunk back to lick\ntheir pride and produce their own soiled report.. .\nDrugstore by name, shiny dresses and swirly eyes by nature\n\"Yeah, we can shoehorn another Fresher in\nhere,\" signals an Ents man, keen eyes spotting a sliver of space vacated when two partners\nsuddenly become 'an item'. Around them the\nUnion building is hot, sweaty and the only\nempty turf is on the conspicuously empty dance\nfloor before the stage.\nBoy Girl Soup are about to play, but the\nephemeral first week alliances are more\nconcerned with each other. The Fisher-Hall\nposse eye up the Bernard-Sunley boys whilst the\nWe-Met-At-The-Physics-Registration ensemble\nshoulder uneasily the Got-Stuck-In-The-QTQueue-Together crew. And all in an unholy stew\nof veteran drunken sharking third years. It's first\nday time again folks!\nSome young, some old, so many. Boy Girl\nSoup have taken to the stage. Three guitars, a drummer, and the flamboyant lead singer have\nlaunched into 'Hard On'. \"I 've got a hard on for\nyou!\" sounds more like the Sex Pistols but is\nsung alongside strumming sensibilities more\nakin to, say, The Rockingbirds. The kids clap\npolitely. 'So Much To Do' and 'Mary Jane' later\nand a few cheers float across the smoke to our\nlads. In response we are treated to ' Mad Woman' sung from the dance floor, a mad\nspiralling mess of green trousers and cheeky\ngrins. The tune is becoming familiar. Three\nguitars have been squeezed onto that stage but\nsurely they're all playing the same rickety\nrhythm? The angry bassist jumps up and down\nand the accordion comes out for 'Baby'.\nThings come alive a little, Boy Girl Soup are\na good time band and everyone's having fun.\nBut haven't we heard it all before? 'Jesus (On\nThe Telly)', a ditty about the scourge of pearly\ntoothed preachers on the box, already sounds\ndated. The tempo'sup rated and someone climbs\nup and prances around before diving into the\nfive (wo)man mosh. Hooray! Exit the band and\neveryone applauds. A solid set, sure, but I'd prefer a little more salt in my soup next time\nplease.\nDodgy cantered onto the stage as the most\nreputed band IC have entertained for quite some\ntime. They were certainly on another plateau to\nBoy Girl Soup. Swirling guitars kicked them into\nshape and the four piece were off. Strangely lead\nby the bass player but having the archetypal\n'nice blok e' drummer, Dodgy were tight. There\nwere Dodgy anthems to begin, then into some\ncovers of yesteryear, always good as crowd\njerk ers. In fact, if you were the sad stage diver, I hope you woke up with a hangover, else you are\nthe first sober person to make that particular leap\nof faith off a two-foot stage. Slack entered the\nset after that, about the same time that the lead\nguitar man started to smile. Following on from\nthis, the single 'Don't Take The Beaten Track'\nstarted off with a bunch of inflatable bananas\nthrown into the crowd. This could be classified\nas 'the beaten track' in my book but everyone\nenjoyed themselves. Inflatable bananas are like\nthat.\nWe're back again on Friday, lured by the\npromise of fabulous music and more nice\nfluorescent yellow wrist wear. Less punters came\ntonight though, and too many of them came too\nlate for the first phenomenal act.\nComing second to Blessed Ethel in the recent\nManchester 'In the City' extravaganza,\nDrugstore are eagerly awaited by some of you,\ncertainly by me and the Melody Maker m usos here tonight.\nAt some point during the first three blended\nsongs notions of second best are dispelled and\nallegiance is sworn. Why? Maybe it's the furious\nhonesty of the vocalist, heart clearly in her\nmouth and in the lyrics she bares before us. Or\nthe sheer virtuous it y of the music - how can an\nunknown band burst out with its colours so\nbrilliantly unfurled?\nThis the real red-hot Pixies fallout, not Frank\nBlack's overblown ego-vinyl or the anti-climatic\nBreeders. But bands that have taken the insanity\nof their basslines and the stop-start elasticity of\ntheir tunes and then dared to smelt the grail and\ncreate something of their own. In years to come\n'Debaser' and 'Gigantic' may be trodden over\nby new disciples seeking a fix from Drugstore\nwith 'Almost Ascending', 'Gravity' and 'God\nHelp Her'. We got ours tonight.\nMaybe I was still in love with Drugstore but\nSidi Bou Said were out of my limb. They sang\n\"I'd rather be a woman,\" and there was me\nthinking that they all were already. Everything\nwas too overplayed and stretched. It sounding as\nif they were uncomfortable with the whole live\nthang until late in the set. Then they sounded\nrelaxed and the last couple of songs had\ndirection. Occasionally, well once, I was\nreminded of The Breeders, so there.\nThe Funking Barstewards were altogether\ndifferent. They wore their wigs with pride; one\neven looked like Don Was. Coming straight\nfrom Disco Mountain, so they said. Someone\nshouted back \"Why did you come down?\" I was\nstill trying to work out if they were real or\nwhether the send up was part of the fun. It\nrecalled the ultimate irony of dancing to the\nSmiths' 'Hang t The DJ' and that happened as\nwell during the evening. OK so I take things too\nseriously but I laughed at that. And so it\ncontinued both day and night. The Funking\nBarstewards strutted their stuff, played with\nplastic fish, giant fans, the whole entertainment\npackage. Their instruments were not so much\nplayed as used as props for tomfoolery and we\ndidn't care because the music batted into the\nnight. It was time to go.\nIn the quad I found a playing card and it was\nthe Joker, honest. I was still on a shopping high.\nThis week's Ents events are previewed on page 18\n\n"

    "content": "10 Reviews\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n4\nThe Wedding\nBanquet\nA witty portrayal of the elaborate lengths to\nwhich Wai-Tung, a Taiwanese-American, is\nprepared to go not to reveal that he is leading a perfectly happy life with his partner as a young,\ngay professional to his parents back home in\nTaiwan.\nPersistent lobbying from home urging\nmarriage and the timely production of\ngrandchildren ends in him persuading his tenant,\nWei-Wei, a Chinese art student who urgently\nrequires a green card, to pose as his fiancee who\nhe intends to marry for mutual convenience.\nThis attempt to fob off parents ends in a giant\nmuddle when they descend (father with ailing\nheart to add drama to the situation) on him to\narrange the marriage ceremony. Part of the\nparadoxical festivity is a sumptuous, if not\nriotous, wedding banquet, a gift from an old\nfriend to Wai-Tung's distinguished father so\nthat he could celebrate his son's wedding a manner that he was accustomed to.\nThe culture clash is played accurately and\nengagingly and woven skilfully into the\nhysterically funny plot that is handled well by\nthe excellent cast. The seemingly rigid character\nof Wai-Tung's father being particularly\nendearing. The bittersweet moments are played\nwith sensitivity in this film which was brilliantly\ndirected by Ang Lee. Highly recommended.\nR.N. The Killer\nNext Door\nJoel Norris\nPulp fiction has never had it so good. Silence Of\nThe Lambs and its ilk have opened a floodgate\nfor the pseudo psychological investigation of the\n'serial murderer', except that these cases\ninvolved real people, but maybe we can't tell\nthe difference anymore?\nStill, here are seven case studies from\nAmerica, where everything is bigger and better.\nThey range from the famous Henry Lee Lucas\n(over 300 notches to his belt) to the original\nHannibal Lecter, Arthur Shawcross.\nJoel Norris (Ph.D) is an expert, they say.\nHe's not out to make a quick buck. All that he\ncomes up with as precursors though are the\nusual dys fu ct ional childhood, drug problems,\ninsatiable sex drive etc. I guess that it's all true,\nbut is it \"inside the mind of the serial killer\"?\nThe thing that did really stand out was the\ninability of the police to catch these people.\nLucas, for example, killed a woman\nimmediately on leaving prison, leaving the\ncorpse on the main road. And that's the way it is\nin the real world. Murder is a brutal, messy\nbusiness and even reading about these made me\nnauseous.\nTintin\nPublished by: Arrow\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nA Philosophical\nInvestigation\nPhilip Kerr\nThis is the story of the hunt for a bizarre serial\nkiller who impersonally assassinates potential\nmurderers, thieves and rapists. A Philosophical\nInvestigation is a heady mix of science fiction\nand psychological thriller following a twisting\ncourse through seediest London, Cambridge\nacademia and behind the closed doors of a secret government project.\nIn the book, Kerr skilfully handles several\nun savoury and politically sensitive issues, whilst\navoiding being, excessive or superficial.\nHowever, the novel is ultimately let down by its\ncentral plot device: The man who kills because\nscience says it is in his nature to do so. Overall\nthis is a well-written book spoilt by the author's attempt to cash in on post Jurassic Park 'science\nis bad' fever. Shame!.\nHouse.\nPublished by: Arrow\nPrice: \u00a35.99 (paperback)\nNational Art Collection Fund Exhibition\nNational Gallery\nThe National Art Collection Fund is 90 years old\nand to celebrate they've organised showings of\nvarious works of art to new audiences in other\nparts of the country.\nTo launch the exhibition they have taken\n'The Madonna and Child enthroned with St\nPeter and St Paul and a Donor' from the\nBirmingham Art Gallery and are showing it in\nthe National Gallery and in my opinion we\nshouldn't give it back. For any of you who\nhaven't visited the Gallery, this is a perfect\nopportunity to take in some of the best works\nfrom nearly every period and in every style\nimaginable.\nIn 1991 the Sainsbury wing was built, giving\na permanent home to one of the finest early\nRenaissance collections in the world. You can\nsee the Da Vinci cartoon (which is a rough\ndrawing from which a painting is planned and\nhas nothing to do with Disney), a representation\nof Saints John the Baptist, Anne, Mary and the\nlittle baby Jesus. The cartoon is probably the\nmost famous work the Fund has ever helped\nbuy. For those of you with more modern tastes\nthere are literally dozens of Impressionists, post-Impressionists and all manner of European art. It\nis free as well, so you have no excuse.\nVery little is known about this work. It is\nknown that it came from the school of the master\nGiovanni Bellini; it is almost certain that he is\nresponsible for the overall composition and the\nsaints. It was part of an altarpiece and originally\nhad doors. The figures themselves are\nbeautifully realised in a way only paintings of\nthis period seem to be able to achieve; they\nappear at once life-like and angelic, perfectly\nvisual ising the dod gy theological idea of being\nboth God and Man. Little is known about its\nhistory; though we can be sure that it came from\nVenice. It is unusual therefore to see a donor in\nthe picture. Though quite common everywhere\nelse to have yourself social ising with the saints\nin pictures you commissioned, the Venetians\nthought this to be just a little too ostentatious.\nWhat we do know is that it appeared in England\nin 1801 and was held in various private\ncollections until it came on the market in 1967.\nThe National Art Collection Fund donated\n\u00a320,000 towards the purchase fund.\nThe Fund receives no money from\nGovernment and relies entirely on its\nmembership. Over the last 90 years they have\nhelped purchase over 10,000 works of art for the\nnation and annually distribute \u00a31.5 million.\nMembership is \u00a315 per year and you can get\nmore information on 071 821 0404.\nThe National Gallery is the big white\nbuilding in Trafalgar Square with all the tourists\noutside it and it is open every day. So don't say\nyou weren't told.\nTony Grew\nOpera reviews are on page 8\n\n"

    "content": "2 News\nFresher\nArrested\nBY ANDREW TSENG,\nNEWS EDITOR\nIn what could be described as the\nshortest academic career at\nImperial College, a fresher has\nbeen suspended for a year.\nAdetola Oshinaike, who was\nenrolled for a course in the\nChemical Engineering department,\nstarted causing mayhem on his\narrival at Garden Hall on Saturday\n2nd October. His behaviour upset\nboth the cleaners and the Warden\nof Garden Hall, Simon Walker.\nBy Monday, he was being\nreported for disciplinary action.\nHowever, Monday evening saw\nhim being the cause of several\ndisturbances in Beit Quad and the\nUnion Building. The evening's disruption started after he\nattempted to get into the Union\nBuilding without a ticket for the\nFreshers' Carnival. Imperial\nCollege Union Stewards managed\nto keep him out after a brief scuffle.\nHe was later seen climbing through\na window in the back of the Union\nBuilding.\nThere then ensued a chase\nresulting in Mr Oshinaike being\nsurrounded by 17 members of\nCollege and Union staff in the\nUnion Bar. Before being thrown\nout of the Union Building and\nwhilst in the process of being\nrestrained, Mr Oshinaike assaulted\nseveral Union Stewards, Dave\nGoddard, the Deputy President\n(Finance and Services) and senior\nsecurity officer Terry Sweeney.\nMr Oshinaike's threatening\nbehaviour did not subside during\nthe week. In the early hours of\nTuesday morning, he acted in a threatening manner to various\nmembers of Garden Hall. At 9am he was arrested for disorderly\nbehaviour, breach of the peace and\nobtaining money by menaces.\nGordon Marshall, Director of\nEstates, was at the scene: \"It was\nthe Warden who called the police. I just happened to turn up when the\npolice were there.\"\nThe police released Adetola\nOshinaike after cautioning him for\ndisorderly behaviour. Following a College disciplinary on Friday 8th October, he was suspended from\nCollege for the period of one year.\nFungal Pour?\nFree Cycle Coding\nImperial College Union Rag has begun its Fungal Spore '94 campaign with vigour.\nOn Saturday 9th October, Rag had its first big event, the annual 'Tiddlywinking Down Oxford Street'. A total of\n\u00a3647.28 was raised, with Imperial College students on hands and knees flicking discs of plastic down the busy\nLondon street. The start was dampened slightly with rain threatening to ruin the fun. However, as the day\nprogressed, the rain did subside. Jane Hoyle, Rag Chairman, said: \"It was a bit tiring and a bit damp, but it was\nreally good fun... it was a good day.\"\nRag's next major event is the annual 'Live Monopoly Around London' which will take place tomorrow.\nEveryone is welcome. Those interested should meet in Beit Quad at 10am. See page 21 for further details.\nSelecting\nUnion\nStewards\nBY THE NEWS TEAM Those attending events at Imperial\nCollege Union could be meeting\nnew faces at the gate as the final\nselections take place for jobs as\nImperial College Union Stewards.\nHowever, many applicants could\nbe disappointed. Dave Goddard,\nDeputy President (Finance and\nServices) said that: \"there have\nbeen far more applicants than\nplaces.\"\nOne change that has occurred\nsince last year is the management\nof the stewards. Following the\nappointment of an Events and\nMarketing Manager, Imperial\nCollege Union Stewards will not be\nmanaged by the Deputy President,\nas was the case last year. Instead\nthey will come under the\njurisdiction of the Events and\nMarketing Manager.\nThe new position, has been\nintroduced as a result of Imperial\nCollege Union reforms that have\nbeen spearheaded into place by last\nyear's President, Chris Davidson.\nBY ANDREW TSENG\nWith the theft of bicycles from\naround campus continuing to be on\nthe increase, the police have\nannounced 'Crime Prevention and\nCycle Coding Days'.\nHeld between Monday 1st November and Friday 5th November, the crime prevention\nand cycle coding will be in the Ante\nRoom, Sherfield Building between\n10am and 5pm. All sorts of information relating\nto crime prevention will be on\ndisplay including videos on\npersonal safety.\nThe police will also be able to\nencode your bicycle free of charge\nwith your home postcode and house\nnumber. Just take your bicycle\nalong to the Ante Room. Cycle\ncoding helps police trace the\nowners of any stolen bicycles.\nFormer Student\nTransported Back\nBY JOE MCFADDEN\nA former student of Imperial\nCollege has come full circle.\nReturning to the college after\nalmost twenty-five years absence,\nBrian Martin has joined the\nUniversity of London Centre for\nTransport Studies here at Imperial\nCollege.\nBrian Martin's long and varied\nexperience in Transport Research\nwill be drawn on by the Centre in\nits studies of rail and road travel.\nThe work will eventually be used\nby the European Commission in\nplanning the development of future\nland-based transport links. This will\ninvolve consultations with\ngovernment departments and other\nresearch institutions throughout\nEurope.\nMr Martin's appointment as an\nHonorary Research Fellow reunites\nhim with an old colleague, Project\nDirector Professor Tony Ridley.\nThe two have worked together on a number of projects over the years,\nincluding the planning of the Tyne\nand Wear Metro.\nThis week's Diary can be found on pages 16 and 17\n\n"

    "content": "22 Clubs and Societies\nScout and Guide Club Go Climbing\nThe Scout and Guide Summer Tour to the Italian\nAlps was convened in the South of France after\na brief, wet and electrifying sojourn in the\nshadow of the Matterhorn. Acclimatising was\nachieved by patronising successively higher bars\nup the valley. Tolerance having been\nestablished, our first forays to the mountain tops\nmet with the gods' displeasure. Eschewing\nstrength with his arm, he did a fair amount of\nstriking down the mighty from their seats. So\nPiedmont was quit in search of the good life, the\nhigh mountains, the cheap wine and the\ncroissants delivered to the tent door every\nmorning.\nThe bottom of the crevasse was our initial\ntarget. Getting in was easy enough - a sensation\nsimilar to walking the plank or discovering that\nthere's one step missing from the cellar steps\nwhen the light bulb has gone out. Getting out\nwas the hard bit. We were forced to leave behind\nsome weaker members of the party (such is\nDarwinism at the sharp end!).\nThose making it back to camp were deemed\nto possess the required skills to be let loose on\nthe unsuspecting French mountains. This theory\nproceeded to be disproved repeatedly. Facile\nroutes were trans mo gri fie d into the Eiger\nNordwand. Bergschrands mysteriously\nappeared, swallowing equipment and people.\nNights were spent on snowy ledges in\nthunderstorms with only a pair of thermal long\nJohns between you and certain death.\nSurvivors staggered back in the early (and\nnot so early hours) and the helicopters were on\nthe verge of being sent out on more than one\noccasion.\nHaving endured these 'pleasures of alp in is m', the reward came in making one's own epic into\nthe most heroic of the tour, over several glasses\nof the local plo nk de pl on ks. For example, ankle\ndeep snow became drifts going over the head\nand 2500 metres was causing terminal altitude\nsickness. All too soon, though, we were\nspeeding back to the homeland, stopping only to\nfill the van with smelly cheeses and expensive\nbottles of wine.\nAmongst the highlights of the remaining\nsummer was camping in a back garden while the\nnext-door neighbours played dance music to\ntheir pot plants.\nThanks must go as ever to Simon Gubbins\n(we look forward to his forthcoming novel '101\nThings To Do With A Dead Tomato') and to\nStacey Kittner whose organisation ensured that\nthere was never a dull moment.\nWe will be piling a minibus to the windows\nand heading off in search of adventure a number\nof times this term (see below for details).

And One More Head On The\nBlock didn't exactly help matters, what with it\nbeing bloody awful. In retrospect I felt very\nsorry for the playwright, Marcel Ayme.\nThroughout the whole piece he tries so very hard\nto be witty. What we are left with is a very poor\nGallic imitation of Noel Coward. The plot, such\nas it is, is merely a vehicle for the alleged\nhilarity; a man sentenced to death knows that the\nonly person who can act as an alibi for the night\nof the murder is the wife of the judge who is also\nthe mistress of the prosecutor. She spent the\nnight with him in a sleazy motel. He escapes\nfrom prison and confronts them all. This is\nwhere I fell asleep.\nThe rest of the audience loved it - all 39 other\nseats were taken. It defies logic that those people\npaid \u00a38 each for this stuff. I would have walked\nout if it was free. Yet they revelled in it. In fact\nthe audience was much more interesting than the\nplay, trying to out do each other and show off to\ntheir partner - and these are hard-core\nHampsteadites we're talking about here, no\ngirlfriends of husbands - that they fully\nunderstood the joke, and why it is particularly\nfunny in French, and basically how very witty\nthe whole exercise was. There were some actors\nin evidence, and you can see a picture of them\non this page. For legal reasons I am advised not\nto describe quite what I though of their\nperformances, but suffice to say I was not\nimpressed.\nTony Grew\nThe Chelsea Centre, World's End Place, King's Road, SW10. 071 352 1967. Tickets \u00a38.\n\u2022 :\nWallenstein Therese Raquin\nWallenstein is set in the Thirty Years War\n(1618-1648) and re-enacts the events of 1634\nwhich led to the death of Wallenstein, the then\nImperial Supreme Commander of the German\nProtestant army. Wallenstein doesn't want to\nbetray the Emperor, but is coerced and tricked\nin to doing so by close friends and generals.\nWallenstein is a well written drama. The set\nis minimal, but subtle lighting changes and\nmaximum use of the available set allows the\nstage to become any number of rooms or places.\nThe acting is simply top notch. Ken Bones is\nexcellent as Wallenstein and Philip Voss is\nenjoyable as the manipulating Octavio\nPiccolomini. What more can I say? Go and see it!\nDave\nRSC Pit, Barbican, EC2. Barbican/ Moorgate\nTube. 071 638 8891. Cones \u00a36.50.\nThis exhaust ingly long, disaster o us french play\nis hopefully a lesson to all adapters and\ntranslation is ts since it shows the dangers of\ndoing a bad job.\nThe story is as old as the hills, and hence a bit boring: wife of sexually inactive husband is\nfed Up, wife finds tall, dark, sexually active\nlover, lover and wife murder husband, lover\nmarries wife, marriage is haunted by the dead\nhusband and hence is a nightmare, mother of\ndead husband becomes an invalid and must be\nlooked after by lover and wife and they all live\ndismally ever after.\nThe music and set are good with an excellent\natmosphere being created from the outset. Alas\nit is ruined by what I can only describe as either\na really dire adaptation or acting that looks more\nat home in an amateur production. The audience\nwere laughing at the serious bits and especially\nat the characters and their over acting.\nThe 'love' scene was hysterical as well; just a blatant excuse for faking orgasms without the\nactors engaging in any bodily contact (have they\nbeen offered roles for the stage version of When\nHarry Met Sally?).\nIt's seems a shame that the refurbishment of\nthe Young Vic should precede this awfulness. I feel let down and hope that the rock opera which\nstarts on the 18th November is much, much\nbetter.\nHarry\nAt The Young Vic, 66 The Cut, SE1. Waterloo\nTube/BR. 071 928 6363. Until Nov 6th.

    "content": "Feature 25\nAutumnal Vegetables On A Roll\n\"Anyway you choose me, you won't be wrong,\" - Billy Corgan, a Smashing\nPumpkin, stutters, sings and then soars.Tintin listened in (twice). . .\nSurprises are not often on the cards in press\nconferences and the Smashing Pumpkins were\nno exception. They've been well polished in the\nhype grind wheel of late. Indeed, the first\nquestion was almost ac liche: \"What does it feel\nlike to be the Next Big Thing?\" You could smell\nthe boredom in the air. Rock'n 'Roll is pretty\ndead if that's all we care about. Still Jimmy,\nBilly and D'Arcy shrugged and carried on\nthrough, it's par for the course. (James Iha the\ndress wielding guitarist was ill, by the way.)\nBilly Corgan, 'a difficult man' so he\nsardonically pre-emp ted, was the hub through\nwhich most things passed. That's normal\nthough, considering that he is the credited\nsongwriter. Still, for someone labelled as a control crazed Messiah, he came across as a good game player, directing questions to Jimmy\nand D 'Arcy. Perhaps his recent marriage had\nsomething to do with it, although twisted media\nlabelling sprung to mind as being more likely.\nHis Superslut T shirt was just part of the irony.\nMuch of the conference was taken up with\nthe issue of the band's, even any bands',\nportrayal/betrayal by the media. Did Nirvana\nand Pearl Jam really change the world or had\nMudhoney, Sonic Youth and Husker Du been\ndoing the same thing for a decade? The whole\ngrunge thing was something larger than music\nand ultimately became a peg on which to hang\nanything from Levi's to films. Billy confessed to\nswallowing the whole Jimmy Page Rock God\nmyth as a teenager. Ted Nugent posters, long\nhair for the sake of image and Spinal Tapisms\nwere the thing to be.\nThe list of the fake bands for today included\nMadonna, Guns ' N' Roses and, interestingly,\nSuede - is Brett's head glued to his shoulder?\n(It's a question you might like to consider.)\nWhich is not to say that their music is no good\nbut that there is no honesty in their image-first\napproach.\nThe point is that journalists need to sell\nmagazines and that's the criteria which a band\nmust conform to in order to get publicity. This\nwas explained time and again. In fact, before\nany questions were asked the first thing Billy\nsaid was \"We're honest.\"\nHonesty is not really what you expect from\nmusicians and it's all the more refreshing for\nthat. Jimmy's well documented drugs problem\nwas another manifestation in question. He saw\nhimself as a rock star and only later realised\nwhat a dangerous game it was. You get the\nwomen, cars, drugs, the whole nine yards and\nthe ego- feeders who pump it all up. This may\nsound like sour grapes but the deeper you get to\nthe heart of the fame business the more people\nwant a part of you. Take heed Musos and\nreaders alike, it's our determination to get a scoop and your desire for trivial information\nwhich are the cause.\nAt about this point some infiltrator at the\nback starts to take issue with the band and\nseveral minutes of acrid argument follow. Billy\nand D 'Arcy are getting wound up, people are\nsquirming uneasily in their seats and I am\nwishing for a miracle of dumbness to fall like\nmanna from heaven. In the end, order is finally\nwelcomed back to proceedings and we can\ncontinue.\nThe question of touring is one which has\ndogged the Pumpkins footsteps, particularly\nafter an infamous visit to the Reading Festival.\nThe touring pressure caused by the 15 months\npromoting 'Gish' almost broke the band up.\nBilly says that the difference is between touring\nand playing. Touring is looking at the world\nthrough a bus window and ending up like a mutant; playing is leaving some of your mind on\nthe stage. Still, for a band known for their\ntendency to twisted perfection, playing 200\nshows could be seen as taxing. Billy and James'\ndress-wearing habits just provided some added\ntongue-in-cheek interest as well as being\nsomething of a false skeleton for the press core.\nThe acoustic gig at Raymond's Revue Bar was\npart of the same process of always looking to do\nthings different. Things start to wind down,\nBilly plays out the tai lenders and it's time to go.\nYes, you can only trust these people about as\nmuch as you trust yourself because they're\nhuman too.\nSmashing Pumpkins\nBrixton Academy\nFor most bands, a producer is a designer label\non which to hang image, not content. The\nSmashing Pumpkins have, with the help of\nButch Vig, produced a carefully sculptured\narticle in the form of 'Siamese Dream'.\nUnfortunately that approach doesn't generally\nmake for good live performances, just because\neverything is in a more harsh and brutal format.\nThe haunting delicacy which characterised\nmuch of 'Siamese Dream' was lost in a heavy\nrippling of basse d guitar. The tracks which\nsuffered most were those which relied on a contrast in power like; 'Hummer', 'Rocket' and\n'Soma'. Interestingly, though, the older material\nfrom 'Gish' worked really well. 'Rhinoceros'\nand TAm One' were placed in a new grown-up\natmosphere which displayed something of the\ngroup's progress. Still 'Cherub Rock' looked\ngood with a beefed up rippling style, as did\n'Geek USA' and 'Quiet', which were amongst\nthe least structured album tracks.\nAnyhow Billy was happy enough, striding\nonto the stage with a slogan is ed guitar: T love\nmy mom.' The rest of the band were the\nbackground canvas for his dreams. Which is not\nto say that they were anonymous, rather it was\nsurprising how much work they had to do to\nkeep the whole effect going.\nBut it wasn't until the encore that the\nPumpkins displayed anything approaching their\npotential. After playing with the crowd during a prolonged 'Soma', Billy returned complete in a clown suit, playing screw-the-press to the last.\nThis, combined with the strong upward lighting,\ncreated a Stephen King figure tte. Round angelic\nface, deep eye sockets, hollowed cheek bones\nand sharp canine teeth, he became a menacing\nfigure who you knew you should ran from but\nwere instead drawn to. 'Spaceboy' was his song.\nPrimarily vocal, it cut as an intensely personal\nsong. Remember that Billy had dedicated it to\nhis disabled brother when playing in the States.\nThis was a moment out of time. The finale was\na stretched 'Silverf&Sk', an epic even on the\nalbum. Here it was splinted with a short\nunaccompanied 'Somewhere Over The\nRainbow' before entering the terminal 'bang\nbang you're dead / hole in your head' stage.\nThis may well have been flawed genius, but\nthe Pumpkins have made my page, dead or live.\nThanks (twice) to Gin at Bad Moon.\nMore music on pages 6 and 7\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nml lih w M:;1m Hater\nHater\nWhen I first looked at Hater, one thing caught\nmy eye ... Soundgarden! When I first listened to\nthe album it seemed to have the feeling of half\ndrunkenness generally associated with grunge.\nThe guitarists played with a certain 'feeling',\n(my neighbour says sloppiness), driving basic\nriffs down my earholes at a volume which must\nhave killed more of my thinking brain than the\nwhole of Freshers' Week.\nThe album starts out with 'Mona Bone\nJakon', a song where noise prevails. John\nMcBain and Ben Shepherd's guitars stomp all\nover the grooves and end in enough guitar\nfeedback to plaster anyone on the wall. 'Who\nDo I Kill?' follows the same pattern of\ng rung in ess with the psychotic chaos of a mass\nmurderer, while 'Lion And Lamb' displays the\nband members instrumental skills. The rest of\nthe album plunges deep into mediocrity,\nshowing that grunge is really a rehash of the\nseventies. If you like predictable music recorded\nwith the worst equipment around, do yourself a favour and either: a) Buy this record or\nb) Get a lobotomy. (6)\nAustin\nReleased on A&M eve's plum\nenvy\nDebbie Harry's dreaming. A new decade, the\neighties, and Blondie's just a glimmer in some\nyesterday's eye. This evening, walking back\nthrough Greenwich Village, she slid\nanonymously past the pink graffiti ed doors of\none of the new/old punk hangouts. Who's playing? Some weirdo noise artists who hate\ntheir guitars and call themselves Sonic Youth. In\nbed she tosses and turns. Her voice, their new\nmusic - a whole new gravy train.\nAnd this album isn't that album, it's another,\nand they've managed to find in Colleen FitzPatrick a vocalist to recreate those glassy tones.\neve's plum sound like two bands squashed onto\nthe same stage. The music can be fiery. 'Blue'\nand 'Once Twice' are ripped through with guitar\nlicks, slides and tinkling cathedral melodies but\nriding with these lyrics, that voice? Colleen\nsounds like a little kid hanging out with her big\nsister's rock friends. When she growls \"I know\nthat I 'll sink into Hell\" during 'On The Outside'\nthe urge is to pat her on the head and hand the\nmic back to Kim Gordon. It's all or nothing\nwhen you bite that apple. (6)\nOwain\nReleased on Epic\nOyster Band\nHoly Bandits\nFolk music comes in two containers marked\neither 'traditional' or 'rock'. In the case of the\nOyster Band, their tradition is Celtic and they\nmanage that very well. 'The Road To Santiago'\nuses the whistle and snare drum and sounds\nvaguely like 'Look Away Dixieland' in places.\nOther traditional notables include the ballad\nstory form of 'Rambling Irishman' and the\npub along of 'Here's To You'. Now this is all\nwell and sweet; oh for a full album's worth. But\nthen the old trap of sounding like Chris de\nBurgh is sprung. The curse is seen on 'Gone\nWest' and 'We Shall Come Home', which both\npan the depths of AOR.\nOverall, it's another very mixed catch which\nleaves me wondering whether it's only the\nAmerican folk ies who can avoid falling between\nthe two stools. We all know that the celtic strand\nof music has been well explored but where are\nthe bands who are developing it for the now as\nopposed to the then.

Many\npeople ignored the rain to turn up and take part.\nEveryone gathered at the C CU offices and then\nwent over to Princes Gardens for Wakey Wakey\nSouthside to wake the residents up. A few\npeople did actually join us from there - they\ncouldn't really ignore us. Also, for the first time,\nLinstead Hall got awake y wake y call.\nFrom there we were all ferried to Marble\nArch for a photo call( after we woke up one of\nour minibus drivers - hello Dave Goddard!). The\nCCUs were all there in their regalia, as were Jez\nand Clem (the RCSU fire engine and the Mines\nflatbed truck). Unfortunately Bo, Guilds' vintage\ncar couldn't make it because of a poorly back\nwheel. Hopefully she will be with us for Live\nMonopoly this Saturday.\nAs soon as everyone had arrived at Marble\nArch, the tid d ly winking started with a vengeance. Enthusiastic collectors made their\nway along Oxford and Regent Street avoiding as\nmany obstacles as possible. Lots of shoppers and\ntourists were so bemused by the sight of people\ntid d ly winking along the street that they reached\nin their pockets and donated some money to\nAction Aid. Some tiddlywinks (but no\ntid d ly win kers) got run over but eventually\neveryone arrived at Piccadilly Circus intact.\nOnce here, we did the traditional ring-a ring-a roses around the Eros, much to the amazement\nof the tourists. Then Jane, our esteemed Rag\nChair, lost some of her dignity by being dunked\nJane, Rag Chair, after being thrown into the fountain at Eros for the first time!\nin the fountain, twice! After all this, all the\ncollectors were ferried to The Queens Arm\nTavern in Draycott Street to try to drink it dry.\nThe total amount of money collected was the\ngrand sum of \u00a3647.28! Well done to everyone\nwho took part. All in all it was a great start to the\nyear and everyone involved enjoyed themselves.\nSpecial congratulations to the top fresher\ncollectors: Emma Russel & Chris Lewis \u00a336.56\n(team) and David Barnes \u00a321.93 (solo).\nIf you missed Tiddlywinks, don't worry, the\nfun isn't over yet. This Saturday there's Live\nMonopoly. Teams of four to six run around\nLondon visiting all the sites on the Monopoly\nboard, solving clues and collecting treasure. Sign\nup at the Rag Office (2nd floor, east staircase,\nUnion Building) from 10am. Afterwards, there's a free party organised by Mencap. There are\nprizes for the winning teams, including a skiing\ntrip to Andorra. See you there!\nKre you a vegetarian?\nEver thought of becoming vegetarian\nCome and check out the\nMain Dining Hall, Sherfield\n18th22 nd October\nNational Vegetarian Week Special Dishes\nPlus\nCommemoration Day Menu on 21st October\n\n"

    "content": "12 Feature\nCareers Fair - Fair or Unfair?\nJohn Simpson, Director of the Imperial College Careers Service advises you\non how best to prepare for this year's ICU Careers Fair and how to get the\nmost out of it once you 're there.\nThe ICU Careers Fair is different from many of\nthe other Careers Fairs you may experience.\nFirstly, it is attended by employers who are\nparticularly interested in meeting students,\ngraduates and postgraduates from Imperial\nCollege. Secondly it is situated in the Sherfield\nBuilding in the heart of College and so is\nimmediately accessible to us all and thirdly, it is\nnot so crowded that you will have to wait for\nages before you can have a discussion with an\nemployer. So, you have no excuse for not\nturning up!\nDo your prep.\nPreparation is all important! Think about how\nyou can get the most from the two days, what\nyou need to say to impress employers and what\nyou want to learn from them.\nAnd homework.\nDo some homework by reading up about the\norganisations which are attending. You can get\nquick information from the various employer\ndirectories such as PROSPECTS (previously\nknown as ROGET), GO and GET, available\nfrom the IC Careers Service. Also, you should\nread the excellent Careers Fair Brochure\navailable on the day.\nClueless?\nIf you haven'ta clue what you want to do, now\nis the time to start thinking seriously about\nyourself. What are your particular interests,\nabilities, skills and values? What do you enjoy\ndoing and what are you good at? The Careers\nService has the computer aided careers guidance\nsystem, PROSPECT (HE), which may help, and\nthere are also work books you can go through on\nyour own.\nInterests, Abilities, Skills and Values.\nThese are the interests you have, such as in\nengineering or science, managerial or\nadministrative, literary or verbal. Your abilities\nsuch as problem-solving, numeracy or social\nconfidence. Your skills such as designing,\nplanning or analysing. Your values such as\nindependence, variety or security.\nOccupations.\nYou may wish to remain with your degree\ndiscipline or you may want to think about a career in a different direction. There are a wide\nrange to choose from: Engineering to Education,\nScience to Selling, Accountancy to Zoo\nKeeping. Match your personal qualities with\nwhat you are good at doing and what you enjoy\ndoing and then you can then try to choose an\noccupation.\nEmployers.\nOnce you've sorted out who you are and what\nsort of occupation you are seeking, you can\nbegin to market yourself to potential employers.\nApproach each one at the Careers Fair as if they\nare your chosen, ideal and preferred employer.\nBe enthusiastic, it is infectious and you will be\nremembered.\nYour Questions.\nPrepare a few questions to get you started with\neach one, along the lines of:\nWhat opportunities do you have for a???? ist?\nCan I get Chartered Engineering status with your\ncompany?\nDo you prefer postgraduates for any of your\nvacancies?\nAt which location do most graduates start?\nWhat are the career development prospects?\nIs a foreign language important?\nWhat travel is necessary in the UK or abroad?\nWhy do you like working for Intergalactic\nIndustries?\nTheir questions.\nBe prepared for employers to take an interest in\nyou and expect some probing questions. What\nsort of work are you seeking? Why are you\ninterested in us? How is your degree course\ngoing? What have you learnt about yourself\nduring your studies? What are your strengths?\nWhat are your weaknesses? What do you mean\nby a management career?\nAnd finally.\nThe IC Careers Fair should help you to start on\nyour career search. You may even end up\njoining one of the companies you talk to. Give\nyourself a flying start by good preparation, and\nif you need some advice, call at the IC Careers\nService stand at the Careers Fair.\nImperial College\nCareers Service\nRoom 310\nSherfield Building\nFor information about vacation training, information booklets, reference files and videos.\nOpen Monday to Friday, 10.00am to 5.15pm A review of the killjoy's latest album is on page 7\n\n"

If a conclusion cannot be reached after a year of\n'discussion', what is it going to achieve if I continue it for possibly another year?\nApologies to those short-sighted people who\nmay be finding it difficult to read the letters on\nthe opposite page. The volume of the response\nto just one of the letter from last week was, as\nyou can see, quite large and the only way to fit\neverything into the space available was to shrink\nthe point size. No-one really wants to read the\nsame arguments week in, week out, so as of this\nweek, I wont be printing any more letters about\nthis particular issue, and that's the end of it.\nFish and Chips\nOn a lighter note, when was the last time you\nhad fish and chips? In my first year here, about\nthree years ago, you used to be able to buy chips\nfrom a place in college called Mustafa's. Much\nto the sadness of many of the inhabitants of\nImperial, it closed down during that year.\nYou've probably all seen the place where it used\nto be - the room at the end of Southside Upper\nLounge (above the bar). It was great when the\nbar had kicked out and you fancied something to\neat - Mustafa's chips fitted the bill perfectly. But\nnow there's nowhere near that does take-away\nfish and chips (apparently some ancient council\nbye-law forbids the sale of them). Maybe it's about time someone thought about doing\nsomething about it; I'm sure there are plenty of\npeople out there who'd love to have a load of\nchips to go with their pint.\nWhoops!\nDid you spot the extra puzzle on the Puzzle Page\nin last week's Felix! I appear to have omitted\nthe last clue from the set of down clues. Sorry\nabout that, I know how frustrating it can be not\nbeing able to finish a crossword when all the\nclues are there. By having one clue missing,\nthere's no hope of finishing it.\nIn case you are desperate to know what the\nclue was or if you are just plain interested, the\nclue should have been:\n23. Raves about goalkeeper, perhaps. (5)\nApologies to John Westwater for the small (well,\nquite major really) screw-up. Hopefully this\nweek's crossword is free of bugs. If it isn't, you\ncan always give the Felix Office a ring on ext\n3515 and we'll let you know what it should have\nbeen. One thing we won't do, however, is let\nyou know what any of the answers are - you'll\nhave to wait for the next issue of Felix to find\nout.\nThanks must go to Jaymz and Tamsin at IC\nRadio for the scribble pad idea. They were also\nthe ones who phoned up on Friday and pointed\nout the small omission from last week's crossword.\nFor those who did attempt the last crossword,\nhere are the answers:\nI'M!I It lR lb lw lA lV lE fSm mum\nn nra nEi ira \u2022 ra ra n \u2022 on unr a nara n^oms nn Qi iBn mmm ra a ra unn nr nra mm \u2022 Q EI HE m nun\nftm ran sH mn \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 i3 HEir a i iran ii md HH in mB Bn HH BH DH ftm HH HM Hm\\ rsi yl MlB lolL i1I SIE IRI Credits\nAndy Thompson\nRose Atkins\nSteve Newhouse\nPenguin\nSimon Govier\nCharlie Leary\nLynne Bravery\nJoe McFadden\nTom Bradley\nD.

I first arrived here while on de mob leave in\n1949 when we had two 'Fresh Young Ladies'\n(no votes for the under 21s) out of 800 students,\nmainly ex-service, at Guilds, some 1800 in the\nwhole of IC.\nThere were fewer lectures but hardly any of\nthe visual aids and course notes that I find\navailable now so I suspect th t the work level\nwas about the same.\nI remember the FIRST issue of Felix, one of\nthe articles began a series on students' cars. It\nwas,a short series because there were very few\nstudent cars but I remember a friend buying an\nAustin 7 No KR3949 for \u00a360, he called in\nj CYN after the girl he met at an IC Saturday\nnight hop. Those hops sparked off four\nmarriages that I went to in '52/'53.\nI await with interest the publication of a letter showing that I am not the oldest student\nhere.\nYours faithfully,\nDudley Parker.\nSomething\nConstructive\nOn The Islam\nDebate?\nDear Miss Land,\nOver the last year the Islam vs. Rest-of-the World debate overtook the letters pages of\nFelix. Personally I couldn't give a stuff about\nthis debate and would like to see a bit of\nvariation on this year's pages.\nIf there are at least 20 people out there who\ncare about the debate, may I suggest that a more\nproductive way of debating the issue (and on a more regular basis than once a week) would be\nto see the Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nand form a 'Debating Islam' society - only 20\nsignatures needed.\nLook, I don't mind you debating it, just don't do it on the letters pages of Felix, it's getting\ntediously boring. I know many share this\nopinion, so please take the hint.\nYours looking-forward-to-something-new-and-interesting-on-the-letters-page,\nMarc Ellis\nHelp collate Felix every Thursday night at about 7pm "

    "content": "Reviews\nnm mmm Short Cuts\nStarring: Jack Lemmon, Fred Ward, Lyle Lovett\nDirector: Robert Altman\nRunning Time: 186 minutes\nJust as you are getting sick to death of formula\nHollywood movies, they manage to completely\nsurprise you with a masterpiece of modern\ncinema. Short Cuts is a unique portrait of life in\ncontemporary America. The film is multi-layered with different people living their lives in\nparallel, oblivious to each other apart from odd\nchance contacts or occurrences.\nThe director, Robert Altman, appears to be\nreaching new heights in his career with this\nmovie. His last film, The Player, was a huge\nsuccess and Short Cuts seems to be going one\nup on even that. It has already won the Venice\nFilm Festival's award for best picture (alongside\nThree Colours Blue) and the entire cast won an\naward for their performance .\nThe screenplay is based on a set of eight\nshort stories and one poem by the American\nwriter Raymond Carver. I 've never read his\nbooks so I cannot comment on the authenticity\nof the plot, but he is said, by some, to be a legendary writer. However, the screenplay was\nwritten by Altman and Frank Barhydt in\nconjunction with Carver's widow. Altman is the\nfirst to confess that the stories are not an\nident ik it reproduction, but still they come across\nas funny and moving.\nIf you are into action or high melodrama this\nis definitely not the film for you. The stories are\njust chance occurrences that change ordinary\npeople's lives. There's no gloss and no glamour.\nLittle Casey gets run over, Stuart goes fishing\nand finds a dead body, Ralph finds out that his\nwife had an affair eight years ago, Stormy goes\nmad and rips up his ex-wife's house. That being\nsaid, the film is not boring. At over three hours,\nit's tempting fate but it's so beautifully made\nthat the stories grip you throughout.\nOne of the major strengths of this movie is\nthe outstanding performances of the cast as well\nas the sheer number of familiar faces. The film\nis full of people that you remember from other\nmovies but can't quite place. Tim Robbins gives\nan excellent performance as the stressed\nmotorcycle cop, Jack Lemmon plays a long lost\nfather, and such strange characters such as Huey\nLewis and Lyle Lovett play mad fishermen and\nangry bakers.\nThis film is a celebration of life. Under the\nLos Angeles haze, an ensemble of bakers,\ndoctors, clowns, fishermen, swimming pool\nattendants and helicopter pilots all laugh, cry,\nmake love, get drunk, argue and kill, smoke\njoints and dream.\nThis film is great, go and see it.\nKamran Malik\nShort Cuts plays at the London Film Festival\nnext month as is on general release next in\nMarch, next year.\nTrue Romance\nStarring: Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette\nDirector: Tony Scott\nFrom the beginning, this has the feel of a heavily\nconstructed film. It's complete and boxed up\nbefore we start. Alabama (Patricia Arquette)\nrelates a talk back from the perspective of the\nfilm's end: \"This is what it was like.\"\nThe inner city canvas of Detroit is the setting\nfor Clarence (Christian Slater) and Alabama to\nfall in love and get married. After a visit to\nAlabama's ex-pimp, ar izz able Gary Oldman,\nClarence mistakenly ends up with with $1\nmillion of coke. Other cameo roles then sail in\nand out of view. Chris Walken, Dennis Hopper\nand Pitt Brad appear in transparent form, loosely\nwoven in. It's very much like The Player except\nthat the stars weren't playing themselves.\nStill, the best idea in the film is to have Val\nKilmer playing a never quite defined Elvis\nfigure, who is the creation of Clarence's pulped\nmind. You're never sure what Elvis is there for\nand he only shimmers into view twice anyway.\nAnother feature of the film is the way the\ncamera plays very close to the face, trying to\nenlarging the characters. We get so close you\ncan even hear the crackle of burning cigarettes.\nAfter fleeing to LA the happy couple attract\nthe attentions of the police department, the\nlegitimate drug owners and a potential buyer,\nwho is a kind of Coppola/Spielberg film\nproducer composite. Everyone gets to meet in\nthe final scene which is a total farce; twenty\nheavily armed men in one small room. They\nshout about for a bit, the usual \"lay down your\nA boy, a girl and a cadillac - that's romance\nguns\" stuff before the climatic shoot out end all\nthe minor characters, disposed of in a cartoonish\norgy of bang bangs.\nThe ending is Hollywood claptrap - some\nmysticism and we're given both our cake and a full stomach. At the end of the day this film\n\"lived fast, died young and left a series of good\nlooking star corpses\". If the advertising for this\nfilm attracts you, go and get Lynch's 'Wild at\nHeart' on video. True Romance is a faded copy.\nTintin\nThe Secret\nGarden\nStarring: Maggie Smith and some children\nDirector: A. Holland\nLet's face some facts. Maggie Smith is sad. Any\nOscar-winner who agrees to appear in a film like\nSister Act, never mind Sister Act II, has either a really bad agent or a really expensive drug habit.\nAnyway, at least with The Secret Garden she\nhas a chance to revive some of that comatose\ncredibility. Not much of a chance, but still.\nAdapted from the 'classic' children's novel\nof the same name, the plot has improbabilities\nwhich even Neighbours wouldn't use. A suitably\nphotogenic little girl loses her parents (they die)\nin India and she is sent to live with her uncle in\nhis large mansion on the moors. She is a spoilt\nbitch. I'm sorry but she is. There is a housekeeper who doesn't like our little moppet.\nPossibly because her name is more prominent in\nthe credits. Eventually she makes friends with\nher maid and discovers a secret garden with a shady past. Then she discovers that the strange\nnoises she is hearing are the screams of her\ninvalid cousin who she didn't know existed. Or\nsomething like that. Anyway, they restore the\ngarden and stop her uncle from being such a morose old hippie (he looks uncannily like the\nlead singer of the Wonder Stuff).\nIt is obvious from the first scene that Warner\nBros, is going all out to try and capture the kid's market from Disney. To a certain extent it has\nworked but God only knows what Dwayne, aged\nnine, from Buttux, Nebraska made of this. I mean, I had trouble understanding the servants.\nDid they have to be quite so northern? Don't get\nme wrong, I'm quite of a Yorkshire accent, in\nit's place. \"Should you go and see this film?\" is\nthe question you all want answered. Well, yes\nand no. That all depends on whether you like\nyour entertainment so syrupy you could use it to\nmake Rice Crispie buns. You decide.\nTony Grew\nA plan of this year's Careers Fair is on the centre pages\n\n"

    "content": "18 Clubs and Societies\nClubs and Societies Column\nby Charles Leary, Deputy President (Clubs and Societies)\nThose of you who are still awaiting information\non the clubs you are interested in may be getting\ndisheartened at the lack of communication. All the people running these activities are full-time\nstudents and have had all the hassles of starting a new academic year as well as trying to run their\nclub. You will get news of what is happening,\nbut some clubs get organised quicker than\nothers. If you feel you have been forgotten, then\nyou can always drop them a note in their pigeon\nhole in the Union Office.\nTwo new societies are setting up: the Society\nfor the Progression of Humanity and the Welsh\nSociety. Both are social societies providing a forum for both events and discussions. The\nWelsh Society will encourage interaction and\nsocial ising between Imperial College's Welsh\ncontingent. They welcome both English and\nWelsh speakers, in fact anyone with an interest\nin Wales. They intend to organise sub sidi sed trips to Wales, Welsh rugby internationals and\nLondon Welsh clubs. Also the Welsh language\nwill be taught free of charge. The first event will\nbe a trip to the London Welsh Club on 29th October. To find out more contact Krista Jones\non extension 6894.\nWargaming and Roleplaying, a well\nestablished and large society, have already\nstarted their programme of events. They meet in\nthe Table Tennis Room (third floor Union\nBuilding) on Wednesdays and Sundays from\nl pm onwards. Roleplaying Games are like the\n'Cowboys and Indians' played by children, but\nthis time with rules. They are either simulations\nor politico strategy games - back stab your\nfriends and allies before they do it to you.\nRAG have been very busy since the start of\nterm. They ran the cloakrooms throughout\nFreshers' Week and organised the tid d ly winking down Oxford Street last weekend. Tomorrow is\nlive Monopoly, an event not to be missed by\nanyone. New students will get practical\nexperience in finding their way around London,\nmeet lots of people, collect cash for MEN CAP and get an invite to the exclusive party\nafterwards. All this and it won't cost you a penny (unless you are too lazy to walk and have\nto buy a travelcard).\nThe Overseas Students Committee have\norganised a Freshers' Disco happening tonight in\nthe Junior Common Room, Sherfield Building.\nOn Saturday and Sunday, the Operatic Society\nwill be holding rehearsals for their musical\n'Opposites Attract'. The performance will be on\nMonday evening and everyone is welcome to\nattend.\nOne of Imperial College Union's newest\nsocieties is the Circus Skills Society. It started\nup last year when it was just a humble juggling\nclub, but now it performs a much wider range of\nskills. They will be in the Union Lounge on\nWednesday 3pm5 pm, so drop in and see them if\nyou are interested.\nThe final word for this week is on the demise\nof the volleyball court. New students will not be\naware of the fact that the Union had this facility\nwhich was used for basketball, volleyball and\nbadminton. Unfortunately, it was built on\nScience Museum property and had to be\ndemolished. By the time you read this, all the\nsports, including both the teams and recreational\nplaying, should be re-sited to other facilities.\nThe College have been exceptionally good in\ngiving every assistance to help replace this\nfacility and, thanks to their help, these sports\nshould continue throughout the year despite the\nloss of the volleyball court.\nWhat An Atmosphere!\nWith Freshers' Week now well and truly over\nwe can look ahead to what's going on in the next\ncouple of weeks.\nTonight, we start off our usual Friday\nAtmosphere nights with the Ents disco kick in' off at 9pm and continuing through until 2am. There's a late bar until lam with a happy hour if\nyou get there early on. Admission is just \u00a31 all\nnight, free if you've got an Ents card. This is the\nformat for Friday nights in general with special\nevents roughly every other week.\nMonday night is a specialist disco with\ndifferent themes each week - you'll have to\ncheck flyers for details. The music runs from\n9pm until 12am and there's a happy hour in the\nbar between 8pm and 10pm. Entry is free.\nThis coming week there are a couple of gems\nfor your pleasure and enjoyment. On\nWednesday 20th October, Club Libido plays\nhost to the Full Monty upstairs in the Concert\nHall. The Full Monty is a long running club\nfrom the Windsor area which has spawned\nvarious high brow one-off events. For this\nevening the Union will be graced by the\npresence of DJ Paul Oakenfold a legendary DJ,\nproducer and remixer who recently went on tour\nwith U2 as well as remixing their hugely\nsuccessful single, 'Even Better Than The Real\nThing'. He also worked with Steve Osborne on\nall the Happy Mondays more famous records.\nSupport on the night will come from Chad\nJackson who is unfortunately more famous for\n'Hear The Drummer Get Wicked' than his skills\non the decks.\nNow, any London club would charge at least\n\u00a310 for a night such as this but in our usual\ngenerous way we're only charging a measly\nfiver. The music on the night should be an\neclectic mix of club tunes old and new. Doors\nwill open at 9pm and the party runs until 2am with a late bar 'til 12am. Bring a friend.\nThe second treat for the week is a somewhat\ndifferent affair on Friday 22nd October when\nAtmosphere plays host to a band currently\ncausing a bit of a stir in the media - My Life\nStory. Impossible to categorise, they mix poppy\nsongs and orchestral sounds with a large amount\nof traditional English eccentricity and come up\nsmelling of a mixture of roses, bacon and eggs.\nThe bands new single 'Girl A, Girl B, Boy C is\na single of the week in both Melody Maker and\nNME but tickets for this event will be just \u00a32 in\nadvance, possibly more on the door. People with\nEnts cards are looking at just \u00a31.\nThis just leaves me to say a big thanks to\neveryone who helped during Freshers' Week.\nSpecial thanks go to Andy Nu and all of the\nDramsoc lighting crew who everyone should\npraise for not just the lights but for their all\nround help. Thanks to the Sabbs, Sam and\nMandy and of course Michelle for putting up\nwith us and to Kash for selling tickets. Last of\nall a big round of applause to all the Ents crew\nthat helped especially Dave and Gav, also Andy\nand BJ for putting me on the right tracks. And\neveryone else not mentioned, I raise my glass to\nall of you.\nTetsuo 2:\nBody Hammer\n\"Imagine Ridley Scott directing a William\nGibson story with advice from David\nKroenenberg.\"\nThis is the kind of blurb Tetsuo 2 usually\nattracts. And it's a fair description really. If\nthose three names mean nothing to you, the film\nis a typical Japanese story of a bunch of metal\nfreaks who turn themselves into living weapons\n(body hammers). They infect an ordinary family\nman with their metal seed, causing him to\ntransform into a man/gun hybrid whenever he\nloses his temper, which he does rather a lot in\nthe course of the film.\nAlong with its vaguely cyberpunk overtones,\nthe film's basic theme is the (rather poetic,\nactually) beauty in destruction, mixed in with\nthe bodily corruption and absorption. The film's imagery is very powerful and the shoestring\neffects add much to the dark, grimy atmosphere.\nIt's being screened at 7pm on Tuesday 26th October in the Concert Hall. You can join ICSF\non the door for \u00a33 and get in free, or if you're\nalready a member who's used up your free film,\nit's \u00a31.20. Members of Japan Society also get in\nfor our membership price of \u00a31.20 and for\neveryone else it's \u00a31.80.\nThe Blues Brothers is showing at ICU Cinema next Saturday\n\n"

    "content": "Feature 23\nLiving On The Box\nBBC2 launches a new documentary series today,The Living Soap. Five\nstudents living together in a house? Soundsfamiliar. Tony Grew investigate\nSimon McKeown, Matthew Lappin, Emma Harris, Vidya Manickavasagar, Karen Bishko\nIf we're going to be honest about it at the\nbeginning, we may as well acknowledge the fact\nthat the Def II series has an image problem.\nBasically, young people think that most of its\noutput is condescending and laughable. And\nlet's face it, Janet Street-Porter (the 35 year old\nclub ber) doesn't help matters. Neither does\nNormski for that matter. The list of supposed\ngood ideas, from Rapido to Reportage, is long\nand embarrassing. So BBC Youth Programming\nhave come up with this idea: The Living Soap.\nWhen I say \"come up with\" it, I really mean that\nthey have blatantly stolen it from the MTV series 'The Real World', shown recently on C4.\nThere is no shame in this and the series looks to\nbe interesting one way or another.\nThe basic premise is the same: five students\nwho have never met are given a house to live in,\ntheir lives are filmed and then shown on TV. The Beeb have opted to film one week and edit\nin time to broadcast the next. The cameras will\nfollow the subjects to college, their girlfriend's house, to clubs. Everywhere. There should be\nsome positive differences from 'The Real\nWorld' whose main problem was that the people\nwere so, well, American. Consequently it was\ndifficult to feel anything for them. I kept\nwishing they would all fall under a bus. But\nstudents, well, that's a different matter.\nThe five in question are all suitably diverse;\nat least that way you increase the chances of\nsome in-house tension:\nWe have Emma Harris who is driven\ncompletely crazy by racism, is troubled by\ntroubles in Somalia, wants to be an advertising\ncopywriter when she grows up and regards her\nson Samuel as her first priority.\nShe contrasts neatly with 18 year old Vidya\nManickavasagar (thankfully known as Spider) as\na London club ber who wants to be a DJ or a supermodel when she grows up. She is annoyed\nby bigots, carnivores and cruelty to animals.\nIt is as light relief that they included Karen\nBishko. Her biggest indulgence is talking on the\nphone and she claims that she would abolish\napartheid. In her defence, she does propose that\nginger people should be made to shave off all\ntheir hair. Unfortunately, her biggest ambition is\nto make her children happy and win Wimbledon.\nAs a bit more of a contrast, they included\nDan Moore, a self confessed Conservative voter\nwhose ambition is to own a multi-national\nbusiness, would introduce a law to imprison\nchild offenders and cites Richard Branson as his\nbiggest influence. As if all this wasn't bad\nenough, he's from Colchester.\nSimon McKeown claims to be famous for\nbeing a sad get, which isn't hard to picture when\nyou learn that his favourite band is Depeche\nMode, friendliness makes him happy and he\nlikes tolerance in others.\nLastly we have Matthew Lappin doing a National Diploma in Audio Systems who\napparently has a problem with the letter 'g', as\nhe says he enjoys \"chill in out, play in tunes,\nwork in and see in my girlfriend\".\nI always feel very slightly guilty for enjoying\nprogrammes like these, almost as if I am\nwatching someone in the shower. It is inevitable\nthat a concept with as much voyeuristic appeal\nas this one will generate a lot of interest. Indeed\neven the national broadsheets have given lengthy\nverdicts on the pros and cons of the idea.\nThe debate seems a simple one of opinion\nand semantics; you say exploitative, I say\ninformative, and so on. In a way, it is irrelevant;\nthe time slots are a clue to BBC2's real motives;\nFriday, 7.15pm gives them fifteen minutes to\nengage those who are looking for something to\nwatch before Coronation Street. Even if they\nlose most of the audience halfway through, they\ncan recoup those losses on the second showing\nat 1.40pm on Sundays, when at least eight\nmillion will be tuning in to catch Eastenders.\nSo it is not just a desire to truly represent the\nlives and views of a generation that drives Def II\nhere; there are several lucrative rating related\nones as well. Again, there is no shame in that -the BBC deserves better ratings. It must be\nannoying when the tat LW T churns out on a Saturday evening consistently rates higher than\nquality programming such as Casualty. The\nLiving Soap is by no means a safe bet either - it\nis set to run for the academic year but we have to\nremember that its success is dependent on\nfactors such as whether people find the everyday\nexistence of five students interesting enough.\nPerhaps the most worrying is the potentially\ndetrimental effect this all could have on our\nparents' ideas of student life. Mine think that I spend all my time in the library - God alone\nknows what they will make of this. Thankfully\nthe programme goes out before 9pm so we will\nbe spared the more enjoyable student excesses.\nYou have been warned, get your excuses ready.\n'Oh no, mummy, our college is nothing like\nthat...'\nRough Guides\nNo, not an expose of bullying within the female version of Scouts, but rather a new series of the excellent\ntravel programme, also from BBC2 and also starting a new series this week. This time the girl with the\nsunglasses and the Asian blok e( who is now a completely different Asian blok e, but nobody seems to really h noticed) pack their suitcases and showcase the Americas.\nFirst up are San Francisco and Seattle, from gay to grunge.

    "content": "20 Clubs and Societies\nEnd Of Summer Sail!\nAt the end of last ye an the Sailing Club went to Northern Ireland to compete\nin the Coleraine 24 hour yacht race. Ben Deverson and Sinead Malone report.\nImperial College Sailing Club's Fireflies\nThis year, Imperial College managed to muster\ntwo teams for the race: 'Imperial College Flying\nCircus' and 'TICkled Pink'.\nAfter leaving college, the first stop was the\nWelsh Harp Reservoir to collect two Firefly\ndinghies. We eventually left London, seemingly\nfully laden, with a further two people to pick up\nen route. Not knowing what the weather was\nholding in store for us, everyone had packed all\nconceivable sailing kit to suit every extreme.\nThe creature comforts were also well in hand\nwith members not only bringing along sleeping\nbags, but duvets, pillows, cushions, foam mats, a music system, twelve juggling balls, four\nperformance kites, copious confectionery and\nenough spare boat fittings and tools to make the\n'Mary Rose' into a Whitbread contender.\nWe finally made it to Cairnryan ferry\nterminal at 4.30am. Whilst some people piled\nout to play frisbee, the remainder collapsed into\nthe newly found space and snoozed for a couple\nhours before catching the ferry.\nAfter arriving at Larne we took the coastal\nroad to Coleraine via the Giant's Causeway\nwhere we stopped to admire the spectacular\nscenery and take team photographs.\nThe warm welcome we received at Coleraine\nYacht Club really made the day. After a team\nsiesta we awoke raring to go for the evenings\nentertainment - a barbecue plus plenty of liquid\nrefreshment!\nThe next morning, disaster nearly struck.\nWhilst rigging the boats we found that the mast\nfor one boat did not fit! We'd brought the mast\nbelonging to another boat! However after some\nfrantic work with an electric drill and a file, the\nmast was jammed into place and the boat was\npassed as seaworthy.\nAs the race start approached the first crews\nassembled and prepared for it, whilst the more\nsenior (or should that be the more cunning) team\nmembers administered to the demanding task of\nattending the Commodores Buffet, which\nboasted some reasonable nosh and free drink.\nWe dragged ourselves out just in time to see the\nstart and to support our two boats.\nThe principle of the race is as follows: Each\nboat is allocated an internationally recognised\nhandicap number. Every time a boat completes a lap, its corrected lap time is calculated as a function of its handicap number and its actual\nlap time. In this manner every boat has a competitive corrected lap time. Hence the boat\nwith the quickest average lap time over the 24\nhours is the winner.\nThroughout the 24 hours our two boats were\nvery evenly matched. As soon as one boat got a lead, a change of helm once again reversed the\npositions. The boats were never separated by\nmore than 15 minutes and, as a consequence, the\ntense atmosphere increased throughout the race.\nAfter 23 hours of sailing both boats had identical\nlap times! Every three hours or so throughout the\nrace there was a change of crew; the two helms\nalternated shifts whilst the crews spent one shift\non and two shifts off. This provided only short\nbreaks and most people were reluctant to sleep\nfor fear of being rudely awakened at lam or 4am only to be told that they had five minutes to\nstumble about in the cold and dark and get back\ninto soaking sailing kit, before wading waist\ndeep in water at the changeover area to meet the\nincoming boat!\nSailing in the dark is really eerie. It was\nblowing a steady force 3/4 and we were sailing\nhard and fast, having to hike-out up the beat and\nsurfing down the waves on the run. The buoys\nwere marked with the flashing amber lights\ncommonly found at road works and in student\nbedrooms, the boats with small chemical lights.\nThe only lighting was provided by flood lights\non the start/finish line and at the changeover\narea. These provided a welcome opportunity for\nthe helm to check the trim of the mainsail,\notherwise it was very dark and quiet.\nAs dawn approached 'TICkled Pink' was\nrecorded as sailing the fastest lap time, however\nseveral hours later it was deemed a mistake as\nno one believed that a Firefly (and student\nsailors) could possibly have sailed so fast!\nFortunately we had very little gear failure,\nwhich is surprising given the testing conditions\nthrough the night. We lost one jib stick\noverboard, another snapped under foot in the\ndark, and a jib halyard broke during the early\nhours of Sunday.\nOur two teams , ' IC Flying Circus' and\n'TICkled Pink', finished 4th and 5th overall\nrespectively, winning two trophies in the\nprocess, 'First Menagerie Class' - not in the top\nthree places and 'Best University Team'. In\naddition to the two trophies, we also won a bottle of Port, two fruit cakes, tee-shirts and\ncaps, provided by the major sponsors to the\nevent, Coca-Cola (Ulster).\nThis highly excellent weekend demonstrated\nto all involved the sort of adventure and\nexcitement that can be had by a club when they\nbranch further afield and compete on a larger\nscale than inter-university racing. All thoroughly enjoyed themselves and hope to\nreturn next year.\nTeams:\nImperial College Flying Circus: Helms - Ben\nDeverson, Mike Dunbar. Crews - Sinead\nMalone, Zara Flynn, Alan Geer.\nTICkled Pink: Helms - Liam Moloney, Bill\nChard. Crews - Mel. Hayles, Sarah Thomas,\nHenry Nebrensky.\n// you want to experience the thrills and\nexcitement of dinghy sailing, come and see us at\nour weekly meetings every Tuesday at 12.30pm in the Southside Upper Lounge or contact us\nthrough the Sailing Club pigeon hole in the\nUnion office. We cater for all abilities from the\nexperienced race helm to the complete novice,\nwith one of the best equipped fleets in the\ncountry.\nA review of True Romance is on page 4\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nCod Staging of\na Masterpiece\nRichard Wagner's vast and uplifting medieval\npageant, Die Meistersinger von Niirnberg, has\nreturned to the Royal Opera House in a new\nproduction by Graham Vick. The singing is very\nfine, the orchestral playing wonderful, but the\nstaging is disappointingly uninspired. To be fair,\na seat in the upper slips is not the best place\nfrom which to make such a judgment (one\ncorner of the stage and the whole backdrop are\ninvisible) but from what I could see, this is not a production to make one proud of this country's flagship opera house.\nThe first act fares the best, largely due to the\ndiligence of the costume department in\nrecreating the look of a Flemish old master\npainting, complete with prominent cod pieces for\nseveral of the Masters. There is much sage\nfinger-wagging and head-nodding from these\nwell-dressed worthies, and the standard\nmultipurpose ROH dramatic gesture (arms\nspread, palms out) is more than a little in\nevidence. The humour is confined to painfully\nun spontaneous slapstick antics from the\napprentices. The light, grainy wooden panelling,\ngives the stage a warm glow, and would not\ndisgrace an un ambitious touring opera company.\nCosi Fan Tutte\nIn this up to date adaptation, sung in English,\ntwo RAF officers test the loyalty of their\nfiancee s as part of a bet with a friend who is\ndetermined to prove that no women can be\ntrusted. In true operatic tradition, where you\nonly have to change your socks to become\ntotally un recognisable, the two officers appear\nin disguise to tempt the women.\nThere really is very little I can fault with this\nproduction. The singing is good, especially from\nSoprano Jacinta Mulcahy as Fiordiligi, and the\nacting brings across all the quirky and subtle\nemotions of the characters.\nThe only short-coming was the rather clumsy\nscenery changes performed in full view of the\naudience accompanied by some off stage\nclatters, but as this was the first performance\nthey can be forgiven. If you know Cosi Fan\nTutte, this adaptation will still provide fresh\nentertainment, while for those who are new to\nopera, it is a light-hearted, easy to follow\nevening of entertainment that will leave you\nwishing for more.\nDave\nAt the Greenwich Theatre, Crooms Hill, SE10.\nGreenwich BR. 081 858 7755. Mon-Sat 7.45pm. Cones \u00a35.50.\nThe medieval streets of Act II are depicted by\nmodel houses, each about the height if a man (is\nthis Nuremberg or Legoland?) and it is left\nentirely to the performers to conjure up the\nmagic of Midsummer's Eve. Beckmesser's serenade fails to gather sufficient momentum,\nand leads into a finale which provides the\nbiggest musical disappointment of the evening.\nThis extraordinary passage (imagine Bach\ndriving a HGV and you'll get the idea) requires\nthe touch of a watchmaker to balance it\ncorrectly, but here too much detail was lost. The\nscrum on stage didn't help; certainly the libretto\ncalls for a brawl, but the exalted music and the\ninterests of clarity surely preclude a descent into\nhooliganism. It's not as if it was funny, either.\nWhat make the 5% hours of this\nMeistersinger pass so fleet ly are certain key\nperformances, and the orchestra. John Tomlinson\nlooks wild and woolly as Hans Sachs, the\ncobbler-poet who plays Figaro to Eva's Rosina.\nAt first sight it appears as if the Green Knight\nhas settled down and found himself a day job.\nBut then he starts to sing and one is immediately\nreminded that this is in fact the Father of the\nGods moonlighting from Bayreuth in between\nRing cycles. Immense amounts of power and\nstamina, total security of line, and enough depth\nand colour in reserve to make the most of the\ngreat 'Wahn! Uberall Wahn!' in Act III.\nGosta Winbergh, as the young knight\nWalther, does not have the bright, metallic ring\nof the true heldentenor, but strong, accurate and\npleasant voices are not exactly ten a penny in\nthis repertoire, and his is welcome. David,\nSachs' apprentice, is sung with panache by Deon\nvan der Walt, who is only occasionally tempted\nto overact. As the villain, Beckmesser, Thomas\nAllen seems a strange choice; someone with a growl and a snarl in his voice would have made\nmore of the role. Nancy Gustafson as Eva, the\neligible heiress vainly pursued by Beckmesser\nand eventually won by Walther, is unremarkable,\nbut she looks the part.\nIt's the orchestra under Bernard Haitink who\nreally steal the show: crisp woodwind, bright,\nsurging strings and, most noticeably, richly\nvaried and character ful playing from a heroic\nhorn section. Bar the one cavil over balance\nmentioned above, Haitink charts unfailingly the\nwide reaches of this full and expansive score.\nIt's true that everything sounds more vivid when\nyou're almost literally suspended over the\norchestra, but that was the place to be last\nFriday, when there was so much artistry and\nimagination from the performers and so little in\nthe production.\nPatrick Wood.\nAt the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on\n16th October and 4th,8 th and 13th November.\nTickets from \u00a37 (upper slips), up to an arm and\na leg. Upper amphitheatre seats on sale at \u00a329\nfrom 10 am on the day of performance. Student\nstandby subject to availability.\nNext Week: Britten's War Requiem on CD\nWe predict that Patrick Wood will say 'awesome' and 'colossal' a lot and\nhave to be taken away for a cold shower.\nCamping Out\nYou are in Happy Valley Summer Camp. Your\npresenters Camp Leader and Camp Mother (alas\nthe Topp Twins) guide you through the summer\nwith their stunningly hilarious rhythmic songs\nand outrageous party games. Not by themselves\nmind you, the audience are not so much asked\nbut feel compelled to get on to the stage or\nbutter some bread (seriously!). This works\nwonders for the play since it provides an\nexcellent opportunity for the Topp Twins to\ndemonstrate their wonderful ad-lib bing abilities,\nwhile giving more laughter to an already near-to-hysterical audience.\nSet in the 50's and incorporating 90's humour and wit, Camping Out is an infectiously\nfunny show that will shock the tame and gives\nconstant laughter to the exciting. Using jokes\nand masses of innuendos (that Julian Clary\nwouldn't dare use) about the Royal family,\nAustralians and members of the audience, an\natmosphere of an almost child-like quality is\ncreated. Everything about the gorgeous but\nsimplistic set and even the out-dated clothes that\nthe Topp Twins wear suggests childishness, not\nthe sort that's silly and likely to be scoffed at,\nbut the sort for adults that will make even the\nserious of folk laugh.\nWith the exception of incredibly shy people\nand the very politically correct, I recommend\neveryone to see this, straight or gay, old or\nyoung, Mainstream music or Indie fan. Not one\nwill leave the theatre with a straight face. And\neveryone will leave wanting more.\nJohn and Susan\nAt the Drill Hall Arts Centre, 16 Chenies St,\nWC1, Goodge St Tube. 071 637 8270.

    "content": "Letters 27\nThe Islam debate seems to have reared it's ugly head again\nalready this year. The discussion went on for much of last year\nand I don't want the same thing happening this year as it got\nvery tedious. As you can see, I had to reduce the text size just to\nfit them all of this week's letters on one page. I will not be\nprinting any more letters on this subject.\nDear Beccy,\nAfter a summer spent working, sleeping, social ising and\ns lobbing out, not necessarily in that order I come back to IC to\nfind at least one thing hasn't changed. Someone is once again\ntrying to convince my friends and I into becoming Muslims.\nBefore I go any further I would like to point out that I have not\nput pen to paper ref. this subject before nor am I in any way\nconnected with the Conservative Society, Club, whatever in\nCollege.\nI would also like to point out to Saleem and others of his\nilk that for most of us intellect and logic only come into play\nwhen working towards our degree, the rest of the time we\nmuddle through life trying as best we can. Not being\nparticularly good with words or at debating topics I 'll get to\nmy main message. My friends and I already know as much as\nwe want to about Islam and we are not interested, nor do we\nwant to become Muslims. I am quite capable of making up my\nmind about what religion I do or do not want to follow and\nhow to live my life. What is becoming increasingly perturbing\nis that anyone believes that they have the right to tell me that\nthe life I lead and the religion I follow is wrong. Particularly\nwhen you consider that I am a native in my own country and\nthe people who are doing the telling are not.\nDear Miss Land,\nI know that I will not be the only IC inmate, who upon\nseeing the title of the first letter in issue 974, immediately\nthought: 'not again' or words to that effect perhaps with\nslightly more colourful language.\nLet me get it straight, I am the last person who wants to\nenter into the 'Islam vs the rest' verbal war of attrition but Mr\nChagtai is too soft a target to pass up. Put in the most\nelementary terms, I think he needs to have a bit of a word with\nhimself. As a third year he must have had his self-righteous\nhead firmly inserted in the sand all last year. If we learnt one\nsolitary thing from the 92-93 Christian-bashing season was\nDear Beccy,\nHaving read the letters page of Felix during my first year\nat College, and being irritated by the tedious persistence of\nmembers of the Islamic Society trying to convert everyone to\nIslam, or more likely trying to justify their own faith in what\nis, after all, just one of many possibilities (as any truly open\nminded person will acknowledge), I was hugely irritated by\nyet another of these letters in last week's issue.\nI wonder if Saleem Chugtai has read any of the Christian\nBible, and Hindu Vedas or Upanishads, the Jewish Torah, the\nSikh Guru Granth Sahib, or the Taoist Tao te Ching? Or how\nabout the scriptures of the Buddhists, the Confucians, the\npractise rs of Zen or the Baha'i Faith? (to name just some of\nthe best known religions/philosophies.) If he has, then perhaps\nhe can claim to be able to make a qualified judgement of\nwhether Islam is the 'truth' or not. If he hasn't, then I'd like to\ninvite him (or anyone of similar inclination) to do further\nresearch before taking it upon himself to enlighten his peers in\na letter of limited scope like his last. As a start, how about this\npoem on the subject by Abu-'l Fazl al-Allaim who was a Sufi\nat the court of the Moghul Emperor Akbar in India in the 16th Century:\n'Sometimes I frequent the Christian Cloister and\nsometimes the mosque,\nI wonder if I went back to Saudi Arabia I would be given\nthe same freedoms of speech. I doubt it, as it was I was not\nallowed to wear a Union Jack on my shoulder or follow my\nown religion whilst I was there. However I do realise Saudi\nArabia is an extreme, (my lab partner brings this up every\nweek!) my most vivid recollection being of the fear the\nreligious police provoked in Muslims and non-Muslims alike.\nIf my limited knowledge of the Quran is correct the Quran\nsays that taking up the Muslim faith should be by personal\nconviction, so it appears that Saleem and others are\noverstepping the mark by telling other students how to live\ntheir lives. I would like to point out that my argument applies\nequally to fundamental Christians or extremists of any faith or\npolitical leanings.\nI don't believe that I have the right to tell anybody how to\nlive within the framework provided by society, equally I resent\nstrongly anyone who believes that they have that right.\nSaleem, I have no beef with you or your religion but with\nyou trying to ram it down my throat, or educate me as you\nterm it, I most certainly do.\nYours sincerely,\nChristopher Hubbard\nthat that particularly odious debate will never be resolved.\nReligion is a personal thing and trying to ram your loathsome\nideals down our collective throat is hardly likely to get us\nflocking to join your exulted ranks. Take note, I'm not putting\nIslam down, that's a mug's game. However I'd like to\nofficially decline Mr Chagtai's offer of what I'm sure would\nbe a scintillating and two-sided debate, maybe his time would\nbe more profitably spent revising some basic grammar.\nAC Christodoulou, Civ Eng III.\nP.S. Mr John Simpson, I did get a job cutting grass at my local\ncouncil so I'm right now counting my blessings and so should\nmany more of you.\nBut it is Thou whom I search for from temple to temple.\nThine elect have no dealings with heresy or orthodoxy,\nFor neither of these stands beside the screen of Thy truth.\nSpeculation to the heretic, theology to the orthodox\nBut the dust of the rose-petal belongs to the heart of the\nperfume-seller.'\nSaleem says in his letter: 'When finding the truth, one\nshould not let their whims and desires dominate over one's thought'. It seems to me, though, that emotion and spirituality\ngo hand in hand, as in a phrase attributed to J.C., but of likely\norigin circa 7th century B.C.E.: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and\nwith all they mind and with all thy strength, and thou shalt\nlove thy neighbour as thyself.'\nPerhaps Saleem's confusing science and religion, which\nare ultimately on the flip side of the same coin. In the same\nway, surely heart and mind are interdependent and both\nequally valid?\nFinally, I hope Saleem finds reason not to hold as low an\nopinion of the intellect of his fellow students as his letter\nevidenced, and I wish him luck in 'finding the truth'.\nYours sincerely,\nSuki Kler, Chemistry 2.\nDear Beccy,\nPlease can you stop the certain tedium that will result if\nany of the 'Islam is/is not better than the Church of England\nor Islam is/is not better than the Conservative Party\ncorrespondents continue to be published before they bore us\nall shit less, and refer any of these tedious no-lifes to last\nyear's Felix 'Editor'.\nCheers,\nRSMU Office\nTo the Editor of Felix, It appears that the Islam correspondence is starting up\nagain. We had the first letters of term in Felix 974, 8th October. I wish to make the following points.\n1. It is disappointing to find a3rd year mathematician\nstating that Islam has a proof of the existence of God, etc. No\nreligion can claim this, except by stating God as an axiom.\n2. Christians and Jews are 'people of the Book' (Qur'an)\nclaiming at least religious descent from Abraham through his\nson Isaac. Moslems claim descent from Abraham through\nIshmail. These peoples are therefore cousins. Moslems are\nobliged to respect this from the word of Mohammed. Since we\nlive in a nominally Christian country, please can they do this\nand stop ramming Islam down our throats; it engenders\nhostility, not friendship.\n3. Jesus of Nazareth is a highly revered prophet to\nMoslems, and there is an account of his birth from Mary in the\nQur'an. I don't like commercial Christmas any more than the\nIslamic Society, but as a religious festival there cannot be\nanything unholy about it.\n4. Moslems should remember that the Christian attitude to\nblasphemy against God is to pray for the blasphemer's soul.\nSome sects of Islam however respond to blasphemy against\nGod with death threats and murder. Mohammed specifically\nstated that it is best to love your enemies, but if this is too\ndifficult then response on the Jewish basis of 'an eye for an\neye, a tooth for a tooth' is recommended. It seems that many\nMoslems do not heed the teachings in their own holy book.\n(You can say the same about some alleged Christians as well.)\n5. Most Moslems and Christians do live in friendship. I do\nwish that the hostile ones would think again, and go along\nwith the majority.\nN.B. I am a Christian, but I have read the Qur'an from\ncover to cover, although some years ago now.\nEdwin Hutton, Process Systems Engineering.\nDear Editor,\nI'd like to pick up on Saleem Chagtai's letter on Islam,\npublished last week. As a Christian there's obviously a great\ndifference in opinion between us, but that's not why I'm writing. I'd like to add my voice to the challenge laid down by\nMr Chagtai in his letter, namely that we have a duty to seek\nthe truth.\nHere at IC (and I'm in my fifth year) it seems as if any\nreference to matters vaguely philosophical, never mind\nsupernatural, are taboo. We seem to wander around, oblivious\nto life's great questions: Why are we here? Where are we\ngoing? Is there life after death? Are we answerable to a supreme being? But they'll never go away.\nShouldn't we be trying to address them? I believe that we\nshould and that we must. The Bible is the most influential\nbook in the history of the world - fact. Yet it's record of the\nlife of Jesus, the most influential man in history, is probably\none of the least read of all biographies in print today. If we are\nproducts of logical and scientific training, then surely there\nmust be a case for studying this book and this man's life.\nI hope to see the day when IC becomes a little more open\nto this kind of discussion. After all, life and death are serious\nthings.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid R Kirk, Civ Eng PG.\nThe deadline for submission of letters is Monday, 6pm "

They all have a groovy and good feel. This is an el pee( shu rely an LP - Ed.) to lift the faint-hearted, give hope\nto the hopeless and smiles for the weeping\n(hmmm, a bit excessive perhaps.)\nFourth surprise: It's not a major hit yet.\nFifth surprise: There is no fifth surprise. (8)\nal\nReleased on MCA\nOUI 3 - Who was their French teacher?\nMolly Half\nHead\nBarny\nMr Molly Half-a Head has a peculiar vocal\nstyle, like someone singing directly through\ntheir adam's apple. Still, once you've overcome\nthat, there's not much else on offer. Their\nplaying verges on professional stoicism.\nDefinition: That's being good at enduring the\nslings and arrows following an outrageous lack\nof ideas. Sorry!\nTintin\nReleased on Playtime Records\nBlink\nGoing to Nepal\nWell, they might be Irish, but they are definitely\nnot U2! Blink play a sort of Indie-pop which\nsounds different to anything I 've heard before.\nThe first (title) track opens with an\nimpressive gong and then passes through some\nvery weird lyrics that seem quite out of context\nwith the rest of the song: \"Mister Magoo, Tell\nBetty Boo, I bought most of your records, But I stopped at number two.\" It finishes in the same\nway it began. Altogether rather groovy, and\nworth buying simply for the first song.\ntim si Released on Lime Records\nAnna\nPretty Jesus\nWith a title track involving the juxtaposition of\nJesus, Hollywood and violence, you could be\nforgiven for believing that Anna were playing\nthe stereotypical indie band game; and you'd be\nright. But they play and win. From the snarl y under bones of 'Pretty Jesus' right throughout\nthere's always combined power chords tearing\nthe songs together. 'Bumper Cars' is like\nvintage Quo, almost.\nTintin\nReleased on free records\nSpiritualised\nElectric Mainline\n'Good Times', 'Lay Back In The Sun', and two\nversions of the instrumental 'Electric Mainline'\nconstitute this EP, Spiritualised's first release\nthis year. The two lead tracks feature all the\nessential elements - Jason's 'Sumner-esque'\nwhisper, the twinkling guitars, the hypnotic\nmelodies and the glorious crescendos, although\nthey're certainly not the 'Lazer Guided\nMelodies' of last year. Noticeably the tempo is\nfaster and the horns are noisier and dirtier.\n'Electric Mainline' meanwhile illustrates\nJason's much talked about Kraftwerk\ninfluences, although its two guises are basically\nidentical. All in all an EP for those who think\nthat Spiritualised should put more effort into\ntheir songs.\nYuen'\nReleased on Dedicated\nthe killjoys\nA Million Suns\nThere are a number of reasons why I should\nchoose to disregard this album:\n1. Jeremy (a true musical neanderthal) has\njust wandered in; said: \"This is good, I don't usually like what you play.\" This in itself is\nan ominously bad sign. Quick, someone slay\nthe virginal m ogg y, the gods are angry.\n2. The promo literature calls them\n'acoustic ky';I ask you . . .\n3. They're Australians, and ante podi an s are\nthe main cause of me not being able to get\nwithin 200 yards of my local pub.\nThus armed with enough prejudice to make\nWilliam Joyce look about as extreme as Paddy\nAshdown, I have to concede that I like this\nalbum. The killjoy's art is that of the much\nmaligned three minute pop song but relying not\nonly on quirky guitar melodies but also on other\ndiverse instruments such as the vibraphone,\nka limba and mandolin (witness the Wonder\nStuffyness of 'Shadoo Shadoo'). 'Trains And\nRocks And Riverbeds' washes over you with\nit's lilting 3/4, whilst the breathless trumpet solo\non 'Yes Yes Yes' is pure Chet Baker and\n'Ruby' .. . 'Ruby' is just the jewel in the crown.\nMuch is made of Anna Burley's voice in the\nAustralian press (I know, I 've read the\nclippings) which falls anywhere between Karen\nCarpenter and Harriet Wheeler Therefore the\nnotoriously easily pacified British public will\nprobably ignore this as they did with other girl\nfronted bands, the Katydids, Forget-me-Nots et\nal, and settle for another Belinda Carlisle or\nRoxette album. Sad but true. (7)\nDavros. C. Dick\nthe killjoys - still smiling at the end of the line\nA review of last week's Ents bands is on page 24\n\n"
