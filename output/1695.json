We sat down\nwith the Fund\u2019s Executive\nCommittee to talk about\nhow it all came about:\nHow did the Fund\ncome about? Was it\na student-led initia-tive?\nThe Fund came about\nwhen several students on\nthe MSc Investment &\nWealth Management and\nMSc Finance & Accounting programmes identified the need for a forum\nin which students could\npractically apply what\nthey were learning in the\nclassroom. It was wholly\nstudent-run, but has been\nstrongly supported by\nboth the Business School\nand the central College.\nWhat were some of\nthe challenges faced\nin establishing the\nFund?\nThere were a number of\nkey challenges we faced\nin setting it up. Raising\nthe funds took considerable time and effort,\nwith multiple pitches and\nproposals to convince\nthe Endowment Board\nto give us \u00a3100,000. The\nBusiness School were\nkeen to ensure the project\nwould be an ongoing\ncomplement to their\ncurriculum, and would\nallow students to put their\nImperial-learned skills\ninto practice. As such,\nwe spent a lot of our\ntime designing the Fund\nas an ongoing part of the\nBusiness School\u2019s \u2013 and\nhopefully, later, the College\u2019s \u2013 offering.\nIn order to get students\ninterested, as well as\nBAD FORM\nPRESENTS: ALEX\nT AT CORSICA\nSTUDIOS\nOff the back of a\nwell-received event\nwith Imperial alumnus\nDoppelate, Imperial\nSoundsystem once again\nheads south of the river\nfor its raucous annual\nsoir\u00e9e, this year with\nLeeds-based party starter\nand Dimensions resident:\nAlex T. Alex has long\nbeen bringing huge names\nlike Hunee, Carl Craig,\nand Lena Willikens to his\nnights around York and\nLeeds, and has recently\nearned himself a monthly\nslotonrenownedUKradio\nstation Rinse to push his\ndark and percussive style.\nBe prepared for some\ninteresting cuts when he\ntakes to London\u2019s deepest\nsound-system.\nBig sets are also\nexpected from Imperial\nSoundsystem\u2019s impressive roster \u2013 providing\nyour ideal soundtrack to a\nguilt-free Wednesday.\nBad Form will be\ntaking place Wednesday\n6th\nJune, at Corsica\nStudios, 10PM \u2013 3AM.\nTickets \u00a33 advance, \u00a35 on\nthe door Tickets: bit.ly/\nbadformalext\nattracting further funding\nfrom external sources,\nwe needed to establish\nthe Fund as a credible\ninitiative that would\nincrease student employ-ability, their practical\nskills, and their exposure\nto the buy-side industry.\nThe Executive Team met\nwith countless industry\nprofessionals to build\nour network, with some\nof these professionals\nrunning training sessions\nin the future: for example,\nwe had one last month run\nby Ryan Shea, Head of\nResearch at Amareos, on\nbridging the gap between\nclassroom learning and\nbest practice in the asset\nmanagement world.\nHow is this Fund different to other finance societies at Imperial?\nOur Fund is different,\nbecause it combines both\nfundamental and quantitative investment strategies.\nAs far as we are aware, we\nare the only student-led\ninvestment fund that runs\nquantitative investment\nstrategies. We\u2019re also partnering with key industry\nfirms, such as Fidelity, to\nform specialised training\nprogrammes for our\nanalysts. In addition, we\nare working with a start-up, QIARK, which allows\nus to make democratic\ninvestment decisions\nbetween a theoretically\ninfinite group of analysts.\nThis could, in theory,\nallow us to open up the\nFund to the entire College\nin the future.\nHow exactly does the\nFund work?\nThe Fund is run by an\nExecutive Team of six\nMSc Investment & Wealth\nManagement students,\nan MSc Finance &\nAccounting student, and\nan MSc Strategic Marketing student. It is also\noverseen by an Investment Committee from the\nBusiness School, which\nensures we\u2019re complying\nwith previously-agreed\nrequirements and risk\ncontrols. We also have an\nAdvisory Board, which\nis made up of several\nindustry professionals,\nfrom companies like JP\nMorgan Asset Management, Aviva Investors,\nand Tikehau Capital. The\nAdvisory Board guides\nus, offering expert advice\nas we make our trades.\nHaving the support of key\nmanagement personnel\nwho are currently working\nin industry has been invaluable in fine-tuning our\ninvestment strategies.\nWe run two types of\nstrategies: a discretionary\nstrategy, based on fundamental analysis, and quantitative strategies, based\non algorithms. The investment is divided between\nthese two in a 30:70 ratio.\nWe want to showcase\nImperial\u2019s unique value\nproposition \u2013 that of a\ntechnologically-innova-tive university \u2013 in the\ntype of investing we do.\nAs such, our quantitative\nstrategies are allocated a\nlarger proportion of the\navailable funding. Any\nprofits from the fund are\nreinvested for future use.\nWho can get involved\nwith the Fund?\nAt the moment, any\nBusiness School students\nwith an interest in invest-ing, or who want to learn\nmore, can apply. Students\ncan apply to either be\nan equity analyst or a\nmember. Equity analysts\nproduce tear sheets, which\nthey use to present their\nideas for new investments\nat our frequent stock\npitches. If approved,\nthe tear sheet forms the\nbasis for a proper equity\nresearch report. The ones\nthat are approved by\nthe Executive Team are\nimplemented within the\nportfolio.\nMembership alone\nrequires no formal time\ncommitment \u2013 students\nmay just enjoy coming\nalong to the stock pitches,\nevents, or hearing from\nour partners and speakers.\nThe Fund is also designed\nto be a networking tool\nfor those interested in\nbecoming analysts in\nthe buy-side industry,\nhence our use of industry\nnetworks to deliver\ntraining programmes.\nThe students we are\nlooking for have a real\npassion for research and\ninvestment management,\na systematic and methodical way of thinking, and\nan analytical mind-set.\nThey should also really\nenjoy in-depth company\nanalysis. While we\u2019re\nonly open to Business\nSchool students currently,\nwe hope to open the Fund\nup to the wider student\nbody as soon as possible.\nIf you would like to join\nthe Fund, please email\nyour expression of interest\nto investfund@ic.ac.uk\nThe Executive Committee. Back Row (L-R): Nicola Zanetti (Co-Chief Investment Officer), Davide Sciuto (Co-Chief Executive Officer), Jan Rinck*\n(Co-Chief Investment Officer); Front Row (L-R): Jonathan Fielding (Co-Chief Executive Officer), Katherine Tunaley (Head of Communications), Atiba\nJackson (Chief Risk Officer), Edoardo Pediconi (Head of Research). *Jan has since left the Fund // Student Investment Fund\n\n"

The girl, Parvana,\nshoos away a dog sniffing\nat their wares, and attracts\nthe attention of a hostile\nyoung member of the\nTaliban, who threatens to\ndemand her hand in mar-riage. Later that evening,\nthe Taliban member has\nher father, Nurullah,\narrested, and carted off\nto prison. With the main\nmale family member\ngone, there is nobody\nto support Parvana, her\nsister Soraya, her mother\nFattema, or baby brother\nZaki. Women cannot leave\nthe house alone without\nfacing a whipping. And,\nso, Parvana dresses up as\na boy, setting out to help\nher family.\nInterspersed with the\naction is an ongoing tale\nParvana tells, both to\nherself and those around\nher, in which a young boy\nsaves his village, whose\nseeds have been stolen\nby an evil Elephant King\nliving atop a mountain.\nThe animation in these\nsections is beautifully\ndistinct, with the al-ready-stylised visuals\nof the film undergoing a\nfurther refinement, until\ncharacters resemble flat\npuppets moving against a\nflat screen.\nThe flatness of the animation style is something\nof a refreshing corrective,\nin an industry dominated\nby 3D animation \u2013 no\n2D film has ever won\nthe Academy Award for\nBest Animated Feature.\nTwomey is adept at\nbuilding characters out\nof collections of simple\nlines and shapes, creating\na panoply of body types\nand movements that never\nfeel anything less than\ngenuine.\nThe style, however,\nremains the best thing\nabout the film, which is\notherwise, unfortunately,\nheld back by a stilted\nscript and poor develop-ment. We\u2019ve barely met\nNurullah for five minutes\nbefore he is carted off\nto prison, making it\ndifficult to connect with\nhis character. Similarly,\nideas within the film tend\nto be introduced and then\nforgotten about, or never\nreally introduced at all.\nThe topic of the death\nof Parvana\u2019s brother,\nSulayman, for example,\nis referred to in passing\nmultiple times early on in\nthe film, but, by the end, is\nsupposed to function as a\nmajor plot point. The tale\ntold by Parvana, similarly,\nseems to serve very little\npurpose other than to show\noff a different animation\nstyle; it doesn\u2019t link to\nthe main story well, either\nin theme or action, and\nwhen it does there is the\nsense it is being forced.\nWhile it does begin to\ntouch on the idea of the\nunreliable narrator, and\nthe ever-shifting nature of\nstorytelling, it stops too\nshort to be anything close\nto mind-expanding.\nThe voice acting \u2013 all\ndone in English with a\nMiddle Eastern lilt \u2013 is\npassable, although at\ntimes it can be stilted.\nThis is most likely due\nto the dialogue within the\nscreenplay, which never\nfeels truly naturalistic.\nThere are two films\nthat come to mind when\nwatching The Breadwinner: firstly, Siddiq\nBamark\u2019s 2003 production\nOsama, which also tells\nthe story of a young girl\nwho dresses up as a boy\nto help her family survive\nin Taliban-controlled\nKabul. Osama, which is\nlive-action, manages to do\na much better job at communicating the danger\ninherent in the practice,\nand the blisteringly\noppressive nature of the\nregime. While The Breadwinner does make much\nof the societal restrictions\nplaced on women and\ngirls \u2013 as well as the harsh\npunishments meted out \u2013\nit never really instills the\nsame sense of tension. We\nalways feel Parvana will\nmake it home at the end of\nthe day.\nThe second film it made\nme think of was Marjane\nSatrapi\u2019s brilliant 2007\nanimation Persepolis,\nbased on her experiences\ngrowing up in post-rev-olutionary Iran. While\nPersepolis and The Breadwinner are roughly the\nsame length, the former\nmanages to pack far more\ninto its runtime, engaging\nwith numerous serious\nthemes in short vignettes,\ntreating them with the\nrespect they deserve. The\nBreadwinner, on the other\nhand, rarely explores\ntopics beyond the broadest\noutlines \u2013 that the Taliban\nregime was hostile and op-pressive. There are certain\npoints of the film that cry\nout for more exposition\n\u2013 Parvana\u2019s friendship\nwith Shauzia, another girl\ndressing as a boy, which\nseems to teeter on the edge\nof romance; or the way\ncycles of power and abuse\ncan replicate themselves.\nAs a boy, Parvana is able\nto repeatedly disobey the\norders of her sister and\nmother, leaving the house\nknowing they can neither\nstop her nor follow. It\nwould have been interesting to see these ideas\nexplored further.\nThe historical context\nof the film is also flattened\ninto a mere backdrop. Parvana\u2019s father, at the begin-ning, explains to her that\nAfghanistan has always\nbeen fought over by\nothers, making the Taliban\nseem like one more in\na long line of nameless,\nfaceless oppressors, rather\nthan something with a\nspecific cultural and historical context. Swathes\nof history become mere\nanecdote, and references to previous acts of\nviolence \u2013 Nurullah\u2019s\nmissing leg; hidden landmines \u2013 that continue to\nhave repercussions. Jet\nfighters occasionally race\nacross the sky, and the film\nclimaxes with the start\nof the 2001 invasion of\nAfghanistan, but present\nit as just another act of\nviolence, rather than a sea\nchange. The result is a film\nthat, although obviously\na work of beauty and\npassion and love, leaves\nthe viewer with little to\nremember it by.\nShout-out to that animated Kabuli palaw for making me hungry in the cinema // StudioCanal\nFILM\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDir: Nora Twomey. Script:\nAnita Doron; Deborah Ellis.\nStarring: Saara Chaudry;\nSoma Bhatia; Noorin\nGulamgaus. 94 minutes\nTHE BREADWINNER\n\n"

In life,\ntoo, there are certain\ntimes the prevailing\ngreater wisdom considers\nto be inflection points \u2013\noften-pivotal moments\nthat mark so-called mile-stones. Examples include\ngraduation and marriage.\nCharacteristically, the\npassing of such moments\nhas a final and enduring\ninfluence on us.\nIn reality, changes in\nlife are rarely so instan-taneous. Most progress in\nlife is gradual. Nowadays,\nthe accepted cultural norm\nis for significant milestone\nmoments to be marked\nwith a shiny plaque, cer-tificate, or perhaps widespread media recognition;\nnevertheless, these are\nessentially snapshots of a\nlifetime of marginal gains.\nChange itself is a\ntwo-sided platform and\nnot a unilateral, unidirectional effort. It naturally follows then that all\nstudents change when they\narrive at their university\nand leave behind a legacy\nof some sort when they\ndepart. Their classmates,\nlecturers, and even the\nbuildings themselves will\nbe irrevocably changed by\ntheir presence. Leaving a\nstudent legacy is assured.\nIf so, perhaps, it would\nbe valuable to consider\nthe student experience\nnot only as a time for\npersonal academic growth\n\u2013learning, for example,\nevery metabolite in the\nCitric acid cycle \u2013 but as\na prime opportunity to\nleave behind a positive\nlasting impact on your\npeers as well.\nDavid Rubenstein,\nco-founder of The Carlyle\nGroup, one of the most\nsuccessful private equity\nfirms in the world, is often\nquoted explaining that\nphilanthropy is more than\njust rich people giving\nmoney away; rather, it\ncan be \u2018money, time, or\nideas\u2019. As such, in this\nhyper-connected world,\nthere is no reason to wait\nto give in feasible and\nlogistically acceptable\nways. Legacy, like phi-lanthropy, can be \u2018money,\ntime, or ideas\u2019. Reaping\nthe emotional and intellectual rewards of leaving\nbehind a positive legacy is\ntoo valuable to restrict to\nthe end of life.\nholistic and three-dimen-sional development. One\nway to frame this idea\nin context is to consider\nthe merits and specific\nrequirements behind\nleaving a personalised\nlegacy during the multitudes of journeys that lead\nto the inflection points in\nour overall life journey.\nAs graduates know, the\ncontact details they leave\nbehind will be used extensively for the purposes\nof soliciting monetary\ndonations and other forms\nof support for institutional\nadvancement. The impact\nthat can be had with this\ntype of philanthropy is\nprofound, yet it is inevitably delayed.\nIt may feel like an\nenormous burden to take\non more \u2018responsibility\u2019\nduring a time of high\nstresses, but a sense of\npurpose creates fulfil-ment. To think how each\nassignment and personal\ninteraction could be\nfurther pursued to create\nwidespread positive\nlasting impact on their\ninstitution, and even so-ciety-at-large, can be very\nrewarding.\nRegret usually stems\nfrom what has not been\ndone. From anecdotal\nand personal experience,\nit is not the temporary\nembarrassment that accompanies a \u2018bad\u2019 choice\nor decision that plagues\nthe mind forever. The\nCV of failures is long\nor short, depending on\nyour luck, genetics, and\ncircumstances, but it is\nthe feeling of not knowing\nwhat could have been that\nstays forever in the mind.\nIt is universal and waiting\nto be triggered, especially\nduring important defining\nmoments \u2013 inflection\npoints.\nIn summary, to leave\nbehind an exceptional\nlegacy as a student is\nsimple:\n1. Be uncomfortably\nvocal\n2. Reach out far\nbeyond your immediate peer group\n3. Listen, read and\nthink about how\nthings should be\nOn positive change\nI\nt has been an enormous privilege to be\nyour Campaigns Officer this year. To see the\ndynamism and enthusiasm that transcends\nour university campuses when various\ncampaigns jump into action has been not only\neducational, but most enjoyable.\nThis year I spearheaded a campaign of my\nown, called SleepImperial, to promote healthy\nsleeping habits amongst staff and students. The\namount of energy and effort required to deliver\nthis campaign successfully was, I admit, much\nmorethanIhadinitiallyexpectedorintended.To\neffectively communicate with key stakeholders\ndelivering events, obtain funding for a website,\nand draft in professionals to design graphics\nto be projected across high-profile screens\nacross campus \u2013 to name just a small selection\nof jobs \u2013 was most challenging. Coupled with\nbeing on geographically distant placements\nthat were intertwined with key interviews\nand examinations made for bittersweet and,\non reflection, entertaining memories. To join\nSleepImperial, and for top sleep-related tips,\nplease visit: www.sleepimperial.com\nI am enormously grateful for the support\nacross all levels of the university, from students\nthemselves to senior staff. Seeing the impact\nthat can be had with campaigns has justified the\nvery real and personal sacrifices made.\nAs the organisational structure of the\nstudents\u2019 union changes, and the broader\neducation curriculum reform begins, of which I\nhad the chance to be a part, the need to be the\nforce for change has never been more relevant.\nIn the end, the nature of student-led\ncampaigns leads to the need to be creative and\nresourceful. Compromise will be an integral\npart of moving forward, and by embracing\ndifferences we can build better synergies,\ncreating better solutions.\nThe mark of a successful campaign lies\nin its longevity. Making the transition from a\nfounder-driven movement to that sustained\nby equally enthused and passionate leaders\nis the most challenging part of leaving behind\nlasting positive change. If it can be done, it is the\nultimate reward. Put simply, people will always\nneed to be helped by people.\nGet sleepy for a re-run of SleepImperial\u2019s\nImperial Sleep Week w/c 4th June 2018\nLIBERATION\nConnor Qiu\nCampaigns Officer\n\u201cLeaving\nbehind a\npositive legacy\nis too valuable\nto restrict to\nthe end of our\nlives\u201d\nAt their best, educational institutions provide\nstudents with the safety\nof a semi-structured curriculum to make marginal\ngains in all aspects of life,\nthat will ultimately be\nrewarded with the assurance of a piece of paper\nthat certifies the culmination of their achievement.\nSuch development for\nindividuals is impressive,\nbut somewhat well-cir-cumscribed and linear.\nArguably, branching out\nwith intention laterally\nwould provide for a more\n\u201cLeaving a\nlegacy of a\npositive nature\nis something\nthat can be\ndone as a\nstudent\u201d\nIt would be regrettable\nif future generations,\nsome of the brightest\nminds not yet known, miss\nout on the joys of giving\nearly, for lack of knowl-edge, encouragement, or\nsupport.

And what is it\nexactly? It\u2019s the game\nthat is currently trending\namongst YouTubers,\ngamers, and angry ten\nyear olds alike. And it has\nbeen for the past several\nmonths; in fact it\u2019s basically a cultural phenomenon\nat this point. What exactly\nabout Fortnite makes it\nso popular? And will the\ntrend last? Let\u2019s discuss.\nFirst some backstory;\nFortnite has been in development for a while. In\nfact it\u2019s actually a zombie\nsurvival horror game\nthat was announced all\nthe way back in 2011. In\nmid 2017, a game called\nPlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds was released and\nrapidly became popular as\na multiplayer online battle\nroyale game. Seeing an\nopportunity to capitalise\non the trend, Epic Games\ncreated a battle royale\nmode out of Fortnite\nwhich was released as\nFornite Battle Royale. It\u2019s\nthis spin-off version that\neveryone is playing and\nwhich is so popular.\nplay it from the get go.\nIt can always be a risk to\nrelease a game for free,\nespecially when you\u2019ve\nput in so much time and\neffort into developing\nit. However, being free\nmeans more people will\ntry it out, including the\npeople who would\u2019ve\notherwise dismissed the\ngame and not played it\notherwise. So you have\nthis domino effect where\npeople play and enjoy\nthe game, rave about it\nso other people hear, and\nmore and more people\nplay because of its acces-sibility.\nIn addition to this,\nFortnite is multiplatform;\nyou can play it on a Playstation, Xbox, PC, or even\na phone. While there\u2019s no\nandroid version yet, it\u2019s in\ndevelopment and due to\nbe released in the coming\nmonths. Multiplatform,\nagain, means that a large\nvariety of people are able\nto play it, and it\u2019s been\ndesigned in such a way\nthat you can play against\nconsole players while\nplaying on the iPhone.\nThis makes it really feel\nlike one, big game that\neveryone is playing and\nhelps make sure nobody\ngets left out.\nObviously being a free\ngame can only go so far.\nThe biggest thing, at the\nend of the day, is that the\ngame is just plain fun.\nThe vibrant colours and\naesthetics immediately\nmake it stand out from its\notherwise bleaker or more\ndrab FPS counterparts.\nIt also combines the\nbuilding features of Minecraft with a shooter game;\nsomething which doesn\u2019t\nsound like it should\nwork but does. Is there\nan enemy sniper gunning\nyou down? Just a build a\nwall so they can\u2019t get to\nyou. It makes for more\ninteresting and varied\nplay styles and strategies.\nIt\u2019s an easy game for\nanyone to get into, though\nit would take quite a while\nto really master.\nThe game also has\nmultiple updates, new\nmodes and timed events\nthat add a new twist\neverytime you play. You\u2019ll\non.) All in all, the game\nappeals to your inner child\nand is a shining example\nof how to have fun and\nnot give a damn.\nSo is this the new game\nof the century or is the\nFortnite trend only going\nto last for a short while?\nProbably the latter if\nwe\u2019re being realistic about\nit. Other games have been\ntrending before; their\npopularity peaks before\ntumbling back down.\nPok\u00e9mon Go lasted a\nmonth while Flappy Bird\nwas able to make do for\na week. Having said that,\nthe Fortnite craze is not\nslowing down anytime\nsoon, thanks in no small\npart to the recent mobile\nrelease and the weekly\nupdates spicing things up.\nWhether the hype dies\ndown in a few months or\nyears, there\u2019s no denying\nthat the game has made\na lasting impact. Even if\nfewer people play it, the\ngame will still be as fun,\nand as outrageous, as\never.\nFornite Battle Royale is the game that\u2019s all the rage these days. But what exactly makes it so popular?\nWhen the entire squad comes together // Epic Games\n\u201cAll in all, the\ngame appeals\nto your inner\nchild\u201d\nThe biggest thing going\nfor it is that it\u2019s free, so\nthat already gives it an\nedge over other multiplayer games like Star\nWars Battlefront or Call of\nDuty.. Free-to-play means\nanyone can download and\n\u201cIt\u2019s free, so\nthat already\ngives it\nan edge\nover other\nmultiplayer\ngames\u201d\nnever know what to expect\nwhen you log onto the\ngame. Sometimes you can\nthrow boogie bombs to\nmake a group of enemies\ndance non-stop. Other\ntimes you can literally ride\na rocket. There\u2019s always\nsome new and interesting\ncurveball that changes up\nthe game mechanic. This\nmeans that everytime you\nplay will be memorable,\nand there will always be\nsomething you can share\nonline. Some crazy wild\nstrategy that worked or\njust being at the right\nplace at the right time, (or\nmaybe the wrong place at\nthe wrong time depending\non which side you\u2019re\n\n"

They barely make it out alive.\nFOOD\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nT\nhere is, fairly or\nunfairly, perhaps\nno meal more\nclosely associated with the student\nexperience than instant\nramen. Different universities may have their own\niconic foodstuffs, but the\nubiquity of instant noodles seems to cut across\ntime and space. At the\nmost basic level, instant\nnoodles appeal to students\nbecause they have the twin\nvirtues of being quick\nand cheap, making them\nhandy in an environment\nwhere neither time nor\nmoney are particularly\nforthcoming. They also\nconform to a long-held\nprejudice against students:\nthat we are too lazy, or too\nstupid, or both, to cook for\nourselves.\nWhile the exam period\nis beginning to wind down\nfor some people, others\nhave yet to even start,\nand, as the student loan\nbegins to fritter away,\nDeliveroo is becoming a\nless-viable option for late-night library sessions. As\nalways, instant noodles\nwill have your back. In the\ninterest of bringing you all\nthe most relevant content,\nan intrepid gang from the\nFelix editorial team took it\nupon themselves to taste-test some of the many varieties of ramen available\non campus. It was, in the\nwords of one participant,\n\u201ca stomach ache waiting\nto happen\u201d. Not all heroes\nwear capes.\nWe head first to the\nUnion Shop, but the pots\non offer are too small,\nand we feel we would\nbe left hungry. Little did\nwe know. Instead, we\nhead down to Essentials,\ncutting across the shade of\nPrince\u2019s Lawn, and pick\nout five varieties of ramen,\nbringing them back to the\noffice for testing.\npowders; dehydrated\npeas that resemble little\npills; blobs of off-white\nfat, solidified into glistening clumps \u2013 are a\nmystery, united only by\na presumed reliance on\nMSG. A message, printed\non the side of some of\nthe packets, cheerfully\nexhorts us to \u2018share great\ntaste with your friends\u2019,\nas if a package of instant\nnoodlesforoneisanything\nother than the loneliest\nmeal in the world.\nPHO GA\nThis is the first type\nwe try, which is lucky,\nsince its flavour is quite\nmuted, and few of the\nlater varieties will leave\nour taste buds fully\nintact. Some would call\nthe flavour of the Pho Ga\ndelicate; others would say\nit is non-existent; one participant simply says \u201cno\u201d\nwhen he tries it. The dish,\nsupposedly modelled after\nthe popular Thai food, has\nnothing to it other than\ntexture; the flavour is\nentirely bland. Pieces of\nwhat we assume are meant\nto be dehydrated chicken\nbob around the pot, like\novergrown sea-monkeys;\nI put a piece in my mouth,\nand it squeaks against my\nmolars, like a piece of\nfatty gristle.\nAll of the ramen come\nwith little plastic forks,\nbut the one included with\nthe Pho Ga is different\n\u2013 with a thinner stem,\nwider head, and three\nprongs, it resembles more\nof a trident than a fork,\nallowing its wielder to\nlive out their Poseidon\nfantasy. It\u2019s an apt choice:\nthe flat noodles are akin\nto some kind of deep sea\ncreature, perhaps a hive\nof eels, or those long\nworms that peek out near\nvolcanic vents. They\nwriggle and flap, barely\nable to stay on the fork\nlong enough to take a\nbite. When we\u2019re finally\nable to get them to our\nlips, they are completely\ntasteless, wet and slimy,\nand \u2013 despite the hot broth\n\u2013 somewhat clammy. It\u2019s\nnot an auspicious start to\nour experiment.\nScore: 3/10\nARTIFICIAL STEWED\nPORK CUTLET FLAVOUR\nOn the surface, this\ndoesn\u2019t appear promising;\nthe name alone is enough\nto turn us off. If there is\nany word that could make\nthe idea of \u2018stewed pork\ncutlet\u2019 less appetising, \u2018artificial\u2019 is pretty high up\nthere. But after the boiling\nwater is poured in, this\nramen cup is what most\nclosely resembles the\ninstant noodles of child-hood: curly thin noodles,\nlooping and swirling\naround each other like\ntangled yarn, floating in\nan orangey-green liquid,\nand flecked with shards\nof green, which could be\ndried herbs, but could also\njust be pieces of plastic.\nOne participant has\nalready tapped out by this\npoint; eschewing tasting,\nhe instead sniffs each\ncup, giving his olfactory\nrating. To him, this one\nsmells like \u201cthe floor of a\nChinese restaurant\u201d, but\nthe taste is surprisingly in-offensive. There\u2019s a strong\nhit of generic stock, with\nundertones of extreme\nsaltiness. It\u2019s quite bland,\ntrue, but that is probably\nto be expected; as a\nflavourful meal, the dish\nis lackluster, but it serves\nas a potent reminder, for\nme, of the times when I\nused to be allowed instant\nnoodles as \u2018a treat\u2019 at\nhome, so I\u2019m sold, if only\non the nostalgia front.\n\u201cThe pack says\n\u2018share with\nyour friends!\u2019,\nas if instant\nramen weren\u2019t\nthe loneliest\nmeal in the\nworld\u201d\nWithin each round,\nsquat container there is\na tangled nest of dried\nnoodles, along with\nvarious packets, whose\ncontents \u2013 beige, ash-like\n\u201cOne\nparticipant\nsays the ramen\nsmells\u2018like\nthe floor of\na Chinese\nrestaurant\u2019\u201d\nAfter a discussion, the\ninitial rating we give this\npot is a four. However, had\nwe known what culinary\nhorrors lay ahead, I feel\nwe would have been a bit\nkinder to our poor, boring\nartificial stewed pork\ncutlet, so I\u2019m bumping it\nup to a six.\nScore: 6/10\nThe chilli flakes clog up the opening of the packet, and only two thirds of the mix makes it in // Felix\nSPICY HOT\nDuring exam season,\nthe Felix Office has\nbecome a regular study\nspace, and this variety\nof ramen is a permanent\nfixture, so we were quite\nexcited to dive in. Assembling the ramen throws\nup the first practical\nchallenge: it comes with a\npacket of chilli oil that has\nclumped together, chilli\nflakes glued to each other\nin small, flat compresses.\nGetting them out and into\nthe pot is a struggle, and\nonly about two-thirds\nmake it out of the packet.\nIn retrospect, this was\nstill far too much. Once\nthe water has been added,\nthe noodles become completely invisible, hidden\nby a thick layer of chilli\noil, a shade of luminous\ncaramine, pooling like\nblood on the surface. It\u2019s\nthe kind of substance that\nstains your clothing, and\nquite possible skin and\nteeth. In the words of one\nparticipant, the dish looks\nlike \u201cmy chance of getting\na first at this university.\u201d\nStill, we push on,\ndredging up the noodles,\nwhich are slick with a\nlayer of glistening oil.\nThe first mouthful burns.\nIt\u2019s not the pleasant\nburn you get from a\nfinger chili, not even the\nover-sweetened kind you\nhave with sriracha sauce,\nbut something more\ncorrosive, like a chemical\nburn. It tastes like the big\nblack and orange crosses\non chemical labels. It\ntastes like the reasons labs\nhave fume cupboards. It\ntastes like singed hair and\nheavy industry and silent\nsprings. I don\u2019t know if\nwe can go on.\nScore: 0/10\nBROAD NOODLE ARTIFICIAL BEEF FLAVOUR HOT POT\nIn all honestly, I barely\nremember how this one\ntasted. In my notes, I\u2019ve\nwritten that one participant described the smell\nas \u201chot sweat\u201d, but after\nthe Spicy Hot variety\nI might as well have\nblacked out, so little do I\nremember about the ex-perience. All I can recall\nis being distracted by the\ntexture of the dish: broad,\nflat noodles wriggle in\nthe broth like giant kelp\nfronds. Despite leaving\nthe noodles \u2018cooking\u2019 far\nbeyond the recommended\ntime, the noodles still feel\nunderdone: they manage\nto be gelatinous on the\noutside, but still tough in\nthe middle. They are, on\nthe whole, seemingly-in-destructible: our teeth\ncompress them, rather\nthan biting through them,\nbefore they spring back\nto their original shape\nagain. They\u2019re difficult to\nswallow, slapping against\nthe side of the throat,\ncreating a choking sen-sation, like being water-boarded from the inside\nout.\ndetailing what it is like\nto suffer from anosmia,\nor the loss of the sense of\nsmell and taste. Although\nit might be temporary\n\u2013 most of us have experienced it to some degree\nduring a blocked nose or\nhead cold \u2013 in some cases\nthe damage will be perma-nent. Sufferers describe a\nworld closed off to them:\nfood is like ash in the\nmouth, a tasteless texture;\nthey are robbed of some\nof the greatest joys in life,\nwhether that be the ability\nto taste a fine wine, or the\nsmell of freshly-cut grass\nin the summer.\nEating the hot and sour\nramen, I begin to feel\njealous of them. The dish\nis a complete assault on\nthe senses, so much so I\nwould petition for its existence to be reclassified as\na crime against humanity.\nProblems begin as soon\nas the packet is opened:\na thin brown liquid is\npoured over the noodles,\nand a stench of unwashed\nfeet pervades the room,\ncatching in the back of the\nthroat. Decanting some of\nthe thin, slippery noodles\ninto a cup, I can feel the\ngorge rising in my throat,\nand I need to pause for a\nwhile before I can bring\nthem to my lips. dirty socks soaked in lye;\nlike the sharp sting of a\nchemical factory wafting\nover a motorway on a\nmidsummer\u2019s day; like\nrotting fruit, macerating\ninto a sour liquor. How\nanyone could enjoy it is\ncompletely beyond us.\nScore: 0/10\n\u00a7\nAfter testing the final\nvariety, none of us are\nable to stomach any more.\nWe sit back at our desks,\nreturning to work as the\nsaltiness of the noodles\nmakes itself known,\ndehydrating us into a\npostprandial stupor, headaches thumping against\nour temples. The pots\nsit on the side, rapidly\ncooling; the thin layers of\nfat float on the top, before\nbeginning to congeal.\nWe eventually take them\nout to the bins, the wet\nnoodles making a sickening thwack against the\nshiny black bags. Back in\nthe office, the smell of the\nramen pots \u2013 a strong note\nof star anise, undercut by\nsomething putrefying and\nchemical \u2013 hangs in the\nair, before it dissipates.\n\u201cThe first\nmouthful feels\ncorrosive \u2013\nsomething\nlike a chemical\nburn. It tastes\nlike heavy\nindustry\u2019\u201d\nWith all this sensory\noverload, the taste leaves\nno impression on the\ntongue; the ramen is bland\nto the point of forgettable-ness. Either that, or we\u2019ve\nalready burnt our taste\nbuds in the previous chal-lenge. Disappointment is\nthe word that comes to\nmind. As one participant\nsays, \u201cyou know how\nmost food that ends up\ncovering your lips with\ngrease tastes delicious? I\nfeel I\u2019ve been cheated.\u201d\nScore: 1/10\nHOT AND SOUR\nOn occasion, in newspapers or magazines,\nyou come across articles\n\u201cEating the\nhot and sour\nramen, I begin\nto feel jealous\nof those\nwho\u2019ve lost\ntheir sense\nof smell and\ntaste\u2019\u201d\nThe noodles have the\nsame undertaste as the\nhot and spicy variety \u2013 a\nsinister chemical punch\n\u2013 but the overwhelming top note is one of\nvinegar, which absolutely\npummels all other tastes\ninto submission.

I say \u2018aptly titled\u2019\nas this is easily his most\nexperimental and \u2018outthere\u2019 record to date; an\nintriguing flirtation with\nthe avant-garde unlike\nwhat we have seen from\nA$AP Rocky before.\nThe album is littered\nwith glitchy bass-lines,\neccentric beats, and\ndetuned lead melodies.\nThere are more than a\nfew stellar performances\nfrom featured artists\non this record. I might\neven go so far as to say\nthat they steal the show\na little bit. FKA Twigs\u2019\nverse on \u2018Fukk Sleep\u2019 is\nespecially memorable\nand phenomenal, making\nthat track the best on the\nalbum. Skepta nails the\nhook on \u2018Praise The Lord\n(Da Shine)\u2019, and Frank\nOcean gives a heartfelt\nand subdued performance\non the closing track,\n\u2018Purity\u2019. The single that\nwas released ahead of the\nalbum, \u2018A$AP Forever\u2019,\nsounded promising and\ncontained an unexpected\nfeature from none other\nthan the one-and-only:\nMoby. That song also had\nfeatures from T.I. and Kid\nCudi.\nEven though his guests\nsteal the show, this does\nnot mean that A$AP\nRocky is unable to hold his\nown. The opening track,\n\u2018Distorted Records\u2019, a\nnoisy and abrasive banger,\nsees Rocky leading the\ncharge and raising the\nroof. Definitely a standout\non the record, even if it\nis in large part due to its\nuniqueness, as it is the\nonly real banger on the\nalbum.\nAnd this is the biggest\ngripe I have with the\nalbum: it feels terribly\nlopsided. The first half\nhas most of the \u2018uptempo\u2019 songs, while the\nsecond half loses itself\nin a seemingly endless\nswamp of down-tempo\ntrap beats, wobbly guitars,\nand spaced out vocals.\nThere are songs in which\nthis formula works, of\ncourse, the aforementioned \u2018Purity\u2019 being one\nexample and \u2018Hun43rd\u2019\nbeing another. But after\nthe third or fourth track the\nsame-old tricks get very\nold indeed. The absolute\nlow-point for the album\nhappens about halfway:\nthe track \u2018OG Beeper\u2019\nsounds like a first draft\ndemo on the bonus edition\nof a B-sides record. Yes, it\nis that bad.\nHowever bleak a\npicture I might have\npainted for you in the\nlast couple of paragraphs,\nI did in fact enjoy this\nrecord a lot. I have to\nlaud A$AP Rocky for his\nwillingness to experiment\nand for the strength of the\nsongwriting in the singles.\nSongs such as \u2018Distorted\nRecords\u2019 and \u2018Fukk\nSleep\u2019 have already ended\nup on my playlist.

It is\na concept almost\nevery individual\nfears in one form\nor another; one that many\nquestion, but few have the\nability to really explore.\nOn May 16th\n, the Science\nMuseum had the privilege\nof unveiling a full-size\nstructural thermal model\nof BepiColombo, the\nfirst European spacecraft\nto venture to Mercury,\nthe planet closest to the\nsun. BepiColombo was\ndeveloped thanks to the\ncombined efforts of the\nEuropean Space Agency\n(ESA) and the Japan\nAerospace Exploration\nAgency (JAXA), and is\nfollowing in the footsteps\nof NASA\u2019s Mariner-10\nand MESSENGER\n(MErcury Surface,\nSpace ENvironment,\nGEochemistry, and\nRanging).\nMercury itself is,\nunsurprisingly, the\nleast-investigated of our\nsolar system\u2019s rocky\nplanets, being only 36\nmillion miles away from\nthe sun \u2013 over four times\nclose than the Earth is to\nour star! Furthermore,\ntemperatures on Mercury\nare often in the excess\nof 350 degrees Celcius,\nfluctuating from as high\nas 430 degrees Celcius on\nthe sun side, to as low as\n-180 degrees Celcius on\nthe night side. The surface\nof the planet is marked\nwith signs of the harsh\nspace environment it is\nsubject to, with craters\nacross its surface indicating previous tectonic\nand volcanic activity.\nAdditionally, due to the\nsmall obliquity \u2013 the tilt\nof the planet on its axis\n\u2013 there is an absence of\nthe traditional Earth-like\nseasons, replaced with\nthe presence of thermal\nseasons governed by the\ndistance of the planet from\nthe sun itself. Technology\nhas been built from scratch\nto help the spacecraft cope\nwith this extreme climate,\nand reach Mercury safely.\n\u201cThe project\nstarted in\n2000; 18 years\nlater, 12,000\nindividuals\nfrom 16\ncountries\nhave made\nBepiColombo a\nreality\u201d\n\u201cAs much as\n60% of the\ntechnology\non the\nspacecraft has\nbeen newly-developed for\nthe mission\u201d\nThe drive to travel to\nMercury started in 2000;\n18 years later, 12,000\nindividuals, including\nengineers and scientists\nfrom 16 countries, have\nhelped materialise this\nintersection between\nscience and technology, to\nproduce this six-meter-tall\nspacecraft, which will\ntravel 48 million miles\nover the course of just over\nseven years. Travelling to\nMercury will require more\nenergy than travelling to\nPluto \u2013 which is 70 times\nthe distance from Earth!\nBepiColombo will be\nlaunched from Europe\u2019s\nSpaceport in Kourou,\nFrench Guiana in October\nlater this year, and will\narrive in Mercury\u2019s orbit\nat the end of 2025.\nSpeaking to Felix,\nAbigail Mackinnon,\nAssistant Curator at the\nScience Museum, said:\n\u201cthis exhibition is an\nincredible opportunity\nto get the public excited\nabout a mission that has\nnot yet begun. Usually, in\nspace galleries you talk\nabout things that have\nalready happened, but to\nhave an area dedicated to\nwhat is about to happen\nis exciting! People will\nalready know of Bepi\nbefore the launch, as they\nhave been to the museum\nand seen the structural\nthermal model, the scale\nof it, and all the engineering\u2026 many people will be\nawaiting its launch!\u201d\ntold Felix: \u201cThe engineering of BepiColombo\nis extremely important\nas the spacecraft cannot\nreach Mercury and\ncollect data if it does not\nsurvive! Therefore, the\nengineering to overcome\nthis harsh environment\nis key, with as much as\n60% of the technology\non the spacecraft being\nnewly developed \u2013 it is an\nengineer\u2019s dream to work\non this project.\u201d\nVan Casteren said the\ninternational cooperation\nneeded for the project had\nbeen complex: \u201cWorking\ntogether with Japan, this is\nthe first time this has been\ndone on this scale. The\nbenefits of international\nBepiColombo Structural Thermal Model (full-scale) designed for testing prior to the flight model\u2019s 2018 launch //\nScience Museum\ncollaboration are huge, as\nthe cost for development\nis in the excess of \u20ac1.4\nbillion, which no country\ncould fund by themselves.\nThe financial aspects\nrequire international\ncooperation, but scientific\nquestions are the same all\nover.\u201d\nThe model itself has\nbeen subject to the same\nenvironment the spacecraft will experience on\nMercury in the future. If\nyou\u2019re interested in seeing\nthe model, you can visit\nthe Tomorrow\u2019s World\nGallery in the Science\nMuseum to get a closer\nlook!\nJan van Casteren,\nProject Manager of the\nEuropean Space Agency,\nSCIENCE\nSteve Allain\nScience Writer\nR\nemember back\nto the days of\nyour childhood\nwhen you\nwould go on long drives\nto see family, or to visit\nthe coast on a warm bank\nholiday. Like me, you\nmay have been observant enough to recognise\nthat car windscreens are\ndevilishly good at catching insects. Fortunately,\nthis was picked up by\nthe Royal Society for\nthe Protection of Birds\nin 2004 when they asked\nmotorists to take part\nin the Big Bug Count,\ncounting how many\nsquashed insects had accumulated on the number\nplates of cars. Now, back\nto the present day: how\nmany times have you\nnoticed an abundance of\nunfortunate dead insects\nstuck to the outside of the\ncar after a long journey?\nThe likelihood is it has\nbeen some time. Before\nour very eyes, insects\nsuch as bees and butterflies have slowly been\ndisappearing, but more\ndrastic declines in other\ninsect groups have only\njust been documented.\nA recent study found\nthat the abundance of\nflying insects in Germany\nhad plunged by 75% over\nthe course of the past 25\nyears. I am sure many of\nyou will find this statistic\nshocking, just as I did\nwhen I first read it online.\nInsects are an integral part\nof ecosystems, with some\nof their most important\nroles being pollinators and\nprey for other wildlife.\nThese new data were\ngathered in nature reserves\nacross Germany, but\nhave implications for all\nlandscapes dominated by\nagriculture, such as here\nin the UK. The causes of\ndecline are not yet clear,\nalthough factors such as\nthe destruction of habitat\nand the widespread use of\npesticides are likely \u2013 as is\nthe climate. For those of\nyou aware of the impacts\nof DDT in the \u201860s and\n\u201870s, it seems that we\nhave created a second\nSilent Spring with our\noveruse of neonicotinoid\npesticides.\nTo reverse this trend,\nwe of course need a\ndrastic change in farming\npractises, and to replant\nwild flower meadows \u2013\notherwise the world as we\nknow it may change for\nthe worse, as ecosystems\nstart to collapse from\nthe bottom up. Without\npollinators such as bees,\nour very existence could\nbe at risk as approximately one-third of the\nworld\u2019s agricultural crops\ndepend upon pollination\nprovided by insects and\nother animals. Insects\nare providing us with an\necosystem service for\nfree, and the least we can\ndo is to help provide them\nwith the habitat and tools\nthey need to do so. Yes,\nsome may be vectors of\ndisease and cause damage\nto crops, but they are\nvital for life as we know\nit. As Sir David Attenborough once said: \u201cIf\nall back-boned animals\ndisappeared overnight\nthen the insects wouldn\u2019t\nbat an eye, but if they\ndisappeared then we\nwould certainly notice\u201d.\nNot the bees!!! // Flickr/Louise Docker\nConnect with Conservation: insect apocalypse\nStressed Mother, Stressed Child?\nB\nefore any of\nus were born,\nthe only way\nwe could get\ninformation from outside\nwas via the senses of\nour mother. In terms of\nevolution, it would be\ngreatly beneficial if we\ncould respond to the\nexternal stimulation our\nmother\u2019s sensed, since\nit would increase our\nchances of survival. This\nprocess of responding to\nchange is called foetal\nprogramming.\nFoetal, or prenatal,\nprogramming comes in\nvarious forms, from behavioural to physiological\nmodifications \u2013 and these\nchanges can last until\nadulthood. A famous\nexample comes from a\ndark part of human history\n\u2013 the Dutch Hunger\nWinter.\nIn World War II, the\nNetherlands was occupied\nby Germany. During that\nperiod, the Nazis had cut\noff the food supply to a\npart of the Netherlands,\nresulting in the population\nstarving for seven months.\nThis tragedy, however,\nprovided a window for\nscientists to look at the\neffects of famine on\nhuman health, especially\non unborn babies.\nBy following up the\nfamilies of the victims,\nscientists found children\nof the women who were\npregnant during the time\nof famine were born\nsmaller than their peers.\nMoreover, children were\nalso smaller on average\nwhen growing up. This\neffect was also seen to be\npassed down to the next\ngeneration, where the\nchildren of this population\nwere also smaller in size.\nSuch potent effects can\nalso exhibit themselves\nin other forms. In a\nten-year study, a higher\nlynx density is seen to\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\ncorrelate with a reduced\nbirth size in snowshoe\nhares, with the offspring\nof the hare more likely to\nexhibit predator-avoidant\nbehaviours. This could be\nexplained by the increase\nin predation risk, leading\nto an increase in stress\nlevel, causing the changes\nobserved!\nIn a recent study\npublished by Dr. Zaneta\nThayer and others, a\nsimilar trend can be\nobserved across 14 different vertebrate species. In\ntheir meta-analysis of 114\nresults, they demonstrated\nthe effects of prenatal\nexposure of maternal\nstressonthefunctionofthe\nHypothalamic Pituitary\nAdrenal (HPA)-axis. The\nHPA-axis is the system\nour body uses to respond\nto stress, increasing our\nchances of survival. When\nexposed to a stressor, for\nexample exam stress or\nthe stress of predation, the\nHPA-axis causes stress\nhormones to be released,\nin turn affecting the body\nsize or maturation rate of\nthe foetus.\nAs 14 different species\nwere studied, the scientists\nadjustedforthebrain:body\nsize and maturation rate\nof these animals. Their\nresult revealed that\nthe offspring that were\nexposed to higher prenatal\nstress level had a higher\nstress hormone level at\nbirth. Amazingly, this is\nobserved across species.\nThis finding is significant\nas it suggested that this\nreaction to maternal stress\nis ancient and conserved,\ntaking us a step forward\nin understanding the\nevolutionary origin of this\nresponse.\nWhat we experience in the womb can have a huge impact on how we develop in life, from stress to hunger.\nDutch citizens queuing for rations during the Hungerwinter // Wikimedia\n\n"

Battling through\nhardship they play well, and at the end of the day say goodbye to members who will be graduating.\nSPORTS\nLochlann Allison\nWolverines\u2019Secretary\nL\nast Sunday,\nI m p e r i a l\nW o l v e r i n e s\nventured one\nlast time out of the comforts of London into the\nwilderness of the north\nfor the final university\ndodgeball fixture of\nthe year: the University\nChampionship. Teams\nfrom far and wide\ndropped their revision\nbooks and grabbed their\nballs to take part at the\nevent at St George\u2019s\nPark, Burton-on-Trent.\nImperial assembled two\nteams of battle-hardened\nWolverines who were\nwilling to sacrifice their\nbody, soul, and a good\nnight\u2019s sleep for victory.\nThe assembly point for\nour warriors before their\ntrek north was outside Beit\nHall at 6am; however, it\nseemed one of our freshers\nwho actually lives in Beit\nHall found the trip downstairs most challenging.\nSleeping through an alarm\nclock could be a forgivable offence, if it wasn\u2019t\nalready the umpteenth\ntime it has happened this\nyear alone.\nBoth teams found\nthemselves in competitive\ngroups where it was all to\nplay for. We arrived at the\nvenue at 9.51am, with the\n1s due to play their first\ngame against Birmingham 2s at 10.00am. The\nodds were unfortunately\nstacked against our brave\nheroes: Leo Haigh had a\ngroin injury from the day\nbefore, the courts were different to what we usually\nplay on, three players were\nrecovering from questionable minibus driving from\nLochlann Allison forcing\nsome out of their seats,\nuseless line referees and\nthe ghastly mental image\nof the main ref in short\nshorts, which left nought\nto the imagination and\nwould put even the best\nprofessional athletes off\ntheir game. The game\nended in a 3-11 loss. The\nlack of a warmup proved\ncostly as nervous errors\nand miscommunication\nblighted our play style.\nWe failed on so many\nof the basics and looked\nfar from the divisional\nleague winning team we\nhad been two months\nago: highlights included\nnot making a catch in the\nentire game, foot faults\non lines, and failure to\ncapitalise on four ball\nsituations.\nThe next game against\nLincoln started much the\nsame as we struggled\nto find our mojo. Three\nfantastic catches in a\nsingle game by our Club\nCaptain George Fish\nbefore the half changed\nthe momentum of the\nmatch and gave us the\nfoothold to get into our\ngroove before going on\nto control and dominate\nwith a final score 12-4.\nThe next game was a\nlocal derby against UEA,\na rival in our divisional\nleague. The first half was\ndominated by us, thanks to\nour initial ball advantage\nearned by Captain Filip\nSebest, which ended 6-2\nin our favour, only losing\na silly 30 second set just\nbefore the half. However,\nthe handicap of having\nthe same useless line refs\nas our first game would\nstrike again. A questionable catch followed by the\nfailure to acknowledge\nan obvious hit would\nprove pivotal in the\nmatch. To highlight their\nincompetence: one of the\nreferees blatantly said the\nquestionable catch wasn\u2019t\na catch and another, when\nasked if he were a referee,\nsaid \u2018no, I\u2019m just standing\nhere.\u2019 The game ended a\ndraw 7-7 and regardless\nof our wingers\u2019 \u2013 Nithin\nThoppuram and Nifemi\nAdejumobi \u2013 fantastic\nplay, as well as George\u2019s\n\u2018tactical\u2019 floor crawling\nagainst Lancaster in the\nfinal game ending 12-4,\nthe fate of the first game\nconsigned us to third\nplace in our group.\nWolverines 2s had a\nparticularly challenging\ngroup. The first half ended\na miserable 1-7, although\npin point single throwing\nfrom James Rice-Mellor\nnarrowed the margins in\nthe second half. In the\nfinal set, Yan Jin Ho found\nherself alone on the court.\nHowever, a lionhearted\ncatch proved not enough\nto win the set and we lost\n7-9 in the end. Coventry\nwere arguably the easiest\nside our 2s were going\nto meet this day as the\nremaining teams \u2013 Winchester 1s, Birmingham\n3s and Hertfordshire As,\n\u2013 are all top flight teams.\nWinchester lived\nup to their nickname\n\u2018Wincheating\u2019 with an\nexceptional display of\npoor sportsmanship and\ndishonesty as expected.\nOur brave Wolverines did\nmanage to win a game\nafter a pivotal catch from\nretiring Wolverine Ciaran\nConeelly and draw a\ngame after James hit out\ntwo England nationals\nbut ultimately lost 3-17.\nIt was much the same in\nthe third game against\nBirmingham 3s, however\nthe scoreline wasn\u2019t the\ntrue tale of the match. The\n2s Captain Philip Zeeuw\nvaliantly lead from the\nfront but unfortunately\nfound his team being\neventually overcame in\neach game, losing 2-12.\nThe final game of the\nday was another local\nderby against a divisional\nrival, Hertfordshire As.\nKnowing our play style\nwell, they focussed early\non hitting out our strong\narm throwers on the wings\nusually leaving Yan Jin or\nLalita Radtanajiravong\nto the end. These two\nphenomenal catchers\nunfortunately struggled to\nfish a catch from multiple\nball attacks and the game\nfinished in a 0 \u2013 20 loss.\nAlthough a disappointing day for all concerned,\nAagu Kangatharan\u2019s harmonica playing soothed\nandconsoledoursaddened\nhearts. The club\u2019s\nspirit proved unaltered,\nhowever, on the minibus\nride home as we had a\ncelebratory KFC meal and\nperformed a Katy Perry\ntribute rendition much to\nthe displeasure of other\nmotorists.\nThe club sadly has\nto say goodbye to a few\nretiring members. Club\nCaptain George Fish,\n1st\nTeam Captain Filip\nSebest, Steve Ndumbe\nand Ciaran Coneelly; we\nwish you all the best in\nthe future.

Oh, and exams and all that. We are mortal men after all.\nR\night in time for\nthe end of exam\nseason, the\nusual suspects\nrec some LPs that you\nshould\u2019ve been listening\nto all along. Sucks you\ndon\u2019t have a time ma-chine, or you could\u2019ve\nhad that many more\nhours of pleasant revision\ncoasting emotionally on\nthe bangin\u2019 tunes we tell\nyou to like. Well, there\u2019s\nalways next year...\nE.MO.TION\nCarly Rae Jepsen\nfame, Rostam Batmanglij,\nand Este Haim, resulting\nin an album defined by\nsmooth baselines, funky\nmelodies, and catchy\nhooks. The whole thing\njust\u2026 bops. Trust me.\nSo, you might be\nasking, why would you\nrecommend an album that\nis the complete antithesis\nof ambiance? An LP\nconsisting of tracks that\nwould never be seen dead\non a \u2018Deep Focus\u2019 Spotify\nmix? Well, the reason I\nrecommend E.MO.TION\nas a revision album is\nbecause there\u2019s much\nmore to revision than\nsimply studying hard.\nTo revise properly, you\nneed to get into the right\nmindset \u2013 the \u2018I\u2019m gonna\nshow this exam who\u2019s\nboss because I\u2019m amazing\nand nobody can tell me\ndifferent\u2019 mindset. Jepsen\ncan help with that. Next\ntime you\u2019re feeling like\nyou\u2019re at the end of your\ntether, just take a quick\nbreak, and put on this\nalbum. Trust me \u2013 as soon\nas the iconic saxophone\nintro kicks in on opener\n\u2018Run Away with Me\u2019,\nyou\u2019ll start to feel a whole\nlot better.

God bless\nyou Carly Rae Jepsen.\n\u2013 Fred Fyles\nThe Disintegration\nLoops\nWilliam Basinski\nLoops are different from\nother ambient music;\nwhile we are listening to\nrepeated samples, each\ntime the sound plays, it\u2019s\nslightly different than\nwhat came before. Over\nthe course of an entire\nloop, the sound will\nchange with imperceptible\nslowness, from a relatively clear sample, through\nto a murky sludge. What\nyou\u2019re listening to is, quite\nliterally, the effect of time\nand decay, transmuted\ninto music; the recordings\nare romantic and incredibly moving, creating a\nsense of doubly-removed\ntemporal distance \u2013 we\nare listening to sound\nthat first existed nearly 40\nyears ago, and has come\nto us through a variety\nof permutations, like the\nlight from a distant star.\nIn total, the four loops\nrun to nearly five hours in\nlength, meaning \u2013 to bring\nus back to cold practicalities for a minute \u2013 they\nare excellent for timing\nrevision breaks. When I\nwasdeepinrevisionmode,\nI would listen to the whole\nthing straight through, and\nthen finish up for the day.\nOn a more philosophical\nlevel, the album reminds\nus that everything fades\neventually; the universe\nhas one direction, and that\nis towards decay. Puts that\nfluid mechanics module\ninto perspective.\n\u2013 FF\nBaduizm\nErykah Badu\nIf you\u2019re stuck in the\ncomputer lab, feeling like\nyour life is going nowhere,\nthen don\u2019t listen to this\nalbum. Erykah Badu was\nonly 24 when she released\n\u2018On & On\u2019, the first single\nfrom her debut Baduizm,\nhelping kick-start the\nneo-soul renaissance, and\nbecoming an instant icon\nof modern music.

Jepsen enlisted\nthe help of a wide range of\nproducers, including Dev\nHynes, of Blood Orange\nWilliam Basinski\u2019s\nDisintegration Loops are\nnot only a brilliant piece\nof ambient music, perfect\nfor long days revising in\nthe library, but they come\nwith their own evocative\nbackstory. The recordings\nwere produced when\nBasinski was transferring\nearly recordings made on\nmagnetic tape to digital\nformat; as the tape loop\npassed through the tape\nhead, the magnetic ferrite\nwould slowly flake off,\nresulting in a gradual\ndegradation of sound. If\nthis wasn\u2019t already meaningful enough, Basinski\ncompleted the project the\nmorning of 9/11, listening\nto the final recordings on\nhis Brooklyn rooftop as\nplumes of smoke on Manhattan Island signalled the\nbeginning of a new global\nera.\nThe Disintegration\nBaduizm was released\nover 20 years ago, and yet\nstill retains a freshness.\nFromtheopener,\u2018Rimshot\n(Intro)\u2019, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re in\nthe presence of a vision-ary: anchored by slick\nbass licks, overlayed with\nrelaxed beats, and then\ntopped off with Badu\u2019s\nmelodic, instantly-recog-nisable voice, Baduizm\nwas one of the best albums\nreleased in the 1990s, and\nhelped pave the way for\ninnumerable women in\nmusic, with a direct line\nto modern albums like\nSolange\u2019s A Seat at the\nTable or Janelle Mona\u00e9\u2019s\nThe Archandroid.\nThe hour-long album\nmoves through a series of\nmoods, but Badu always\nMy time as an Imperial\nstudent officially came\nto an end on Friday and,\nduring my four years\nhere, I have come to the\nharsh realisation that I\nhave the attention span of\na gnat. I struggle to focus\non revision for more than\nhalf an hour and, without\nmusic, my falling asleep\nin the blink of an eye is\nalmost inevitable. Having\nsaid that, if the music is\ntoo engaging, it becomes\na distraction and I get little\nto nothing done. My go\nto for revision is smooth\nR&B. The chilled, lo-fi\nproduction creates the\nperfect atmosphere conducive to making those brain\ngains. Sampha\u2019s iconic\n2017 album Process is\nideal for studying. On the\nalbum, he expresses the\nemotions of loss, love, and\ngrowth within multiple\ntracks, using his unique\nvoice to tell the story of\nhis mother\u2019s passing. The\nalbum served to prove\nwhy his talent has him as\none of the most trusted\ncollaborators in the\nindustry, working with the\nlikes of Drake, Solange,\nand more. Sampha\u2019s\nsmooth vocals overlay\nsubtle instrumentals and,\nas a result, Process makes\nfor an overall calm and\nsoothing listening expe-rience. It is perfect for\nrevision because it relaxes\nme, allowing me to get in\nthe right frame of mind to\nstudy, and it doesn\u2019t serve\nto distract. Process also\nhas the added bonus of\nbeing engaging enough to\npay attention to the lyrics\nduring your breaks and get\nlost in Sampha\u2019s world.\n\u2013 Andy Djaba\nCTRL\nSZA\nwritten almost entirely\nfrom the perspective of a\nsidechick. For too long,\nthe women on the side\nhave been neglected in the\nmusic industry and SZA\u2019s\nalbum plays a pivotal\nrole in shining a light\nonto their plight, raising\nawareness and starting\na necessary dialogue on\nproper mistress management.\u201d All jokes aside,\nSZA\u2019s beautiful voice\nshines on CTRL and the\nalbum marks a departure\nfrom the more ethereal\nsound of her previous\nmixtape efforts.\n\u2013 AD\nBeat Tape 2\nTom Misch\nYes Lawd!\nNxWorries\nreminding you of the\ngood times ahead. With\ntracks like \u2018Jodi\u2019, \u2018Sidepiece\u2019, and \u2018Lyk Dis\u2019, Yes\nLawd! will undoubtedly\nput a smile on your face,\ndespite being trapped in\nthe sweaty confines of\nCentral Library. To be\nhonest, I could recommend any Anderson .Paak\nbecause I am of the firm\nbelief that everybody\nneeds some .Paak in their\nlives. However his solo\nmusic tends to take a more\nupbeat, groovy direction\nwhich some may find too\ndistracting for revision\nin comparison to his\ncollaborative output with\nNxWorries. Save albums\nlike his solo effort Malibu\nfor a quick dance during\nyour break.\n\u2013 AD\nHarmony in Ultraviolet\nTim Hecker\nIt has elements of that\nfeeling of coziness during\na rainstorm; there\u2019s just a\nhint of malaise \u2013 a pinch\nof decay \u2013 a drop of grit\n\u2013 maybe just a little bit of\nthe ol\u2019 too-bummed-to-feel-my-extremities, just\nlike you, you sad-sack\nhaven\u2019t-slept-in-threedays walking corpse of a\nstudent in exam season.\nWell, frankly, it\u2019s hard to\npin down. The whole point\nis the vibe, not virtuosic\ndisplays of technicality, or\ndeep lyricism to read into,\nor some tragic backstory\nabout how the Guy Who\nMade The Happy Album\nReally Wanted to Kill\nHimself And That\u2019s Why\nI Listen, Because I\u2019m 14\nAnd Appreciate the Clusterfuck That Is Human\nEmotion, and if that vibe\nis difficult to succinctly\nexpress, well, maybe\nthat\u2019s a hint that the album\nis nice and nuanced.\nI\u2019ll give you more\nthan a hint, though: the\nalbum is deeply, deeply\nrich. There\u2019s no need for\nflashy technicality; the\nbeautifully-architected\nsoundscape and the complexity of the mood so\neffectively evoked by the\nalbum cement its position\nin my pantheon of adored\nalbums; the handy fact\nthat it\u2019s a slow-paced\ninstrumental album makes\nit pretty good to study\nwith.

Unlike\nGeography, on Beat Tape\n2, Misch allows his vocals\nto take a backseat, letting\nthe multiple featured\nartists take control of the\nsinging (and rapping, in\nLoyle Carner\u2019s case) over\nthe top of his production.\n\u2013 AD\nYes Lawd! is the 2016\ncollaborative effort of\nNxWorries, a group\ncomprising eccentric\nvocalist Anderson .Paak\nand producer Knxwledge.\nAnderson .Paak is the\nepitome of a unique\nartist and it is difficult\nto categorise his eclectic\nstyle and to put into words\nexactly what he brings to\nthe table.\nThis, fellas, is a heckin\u2019\ngood album. It\u2019s got a real\ntranscendental gloom to it\n\u2013 I like listening to Foreign\nPolicy\u2019s ER podcast with\nit goin\u2019 in the background.\nThere\u2019s just something\nnice about how the bro-ken-up-over-the-shitty-phone-link conversations\nabout the Impending End\nof the World and whether\nAmazonian natives have\nthe right to kill disabled\nnewborns goes so nicely\nover a grimy chorus of\nharsh noise; and yet,\nHecker pulls naught but\nthe loveliest of harmonies\nout of seemingly nowhere.\nThere\u2019s a reason why this\nalbum has topped the lists\nof many an ambient album\nreviewer, and it ain\u2019t the\ncover.\nThe exact vibe is pretty\ndifficult to pin down.\nWell, hey, this is a\nspread about albums to\nstudy to. If we\u2019re doing the\n\u201cvariations on a theme\u201d\nthing, that theme might as\nwell be crippling depres-sion, because nothing else\nquite sums up the mood of\nexam-time Imperial.\nI kid; this album isn\u2019t\nquite as dour as you might\nsuspect from the first par-agraph. It is, however, decidedly mellow and mid-dlingly dystopian. Scratch\nthat, it sounds like the\nlast album I wrote about\nfucked Blade Runner and\nhad a vaporwave album\nfor a love-child.\nSwelling synths,\nreluctantly descending\narpeggios, that whooshing\nsound every door in every\nsci-fi TV show makes\nwhen the disposable\nguy in the red shirt goes\nthrough \u2013 what\u2019s not to\nlove? If rainy cyberpunk\nnear-future LA is your\naesthetic and you need a\npeaceful soundtrack for\nthe thousand-yard-stare\nout your window every\nnight, notes clutched and\ncrumpled, tears rolling,\nyou\u2019ll love this album.\nI\u2019m out of space. Cop\nsome jazz and funk too,\nok?\n- HE\nI know one thing for\ncertain, Anderson .Paak\nis a wavy dude. Anderson\n.Paak can rap with the\nbest in hip-hop, has a\nunique voice that seems\nwell-suited to R&B and\nthe music he releases has\nshades of neo-soul and\nfunk. He is the quintessential alternative artist\nand, in Knxwledge, he\nhas managed to find the\nperfect musical partner to\ncomplement his artistry.\nThis album is packed\nwith chilled, summer\ntime vibes that will get\nyou through revision by\n\u201cBeat Tape 2\nis a smooth,\nchilled offering\nhighlighting\nMisch\u2019s talent\u201d\n// 2 8 1 4\n\n"

Going to famous European resorts can be expensive and time-consuming but don\u2019t worry,\nwe\u2019ve got you covered \u2013 here\u2019s a guide to some affordable seaside destinations close to London.\nW\nith the\nupcoming\ns u m m e r\nb r e a k ,\nmany of us will want to\nget away from busy and\npolluted London and\nrelax on the beach. I can\u2019t\ncount the times I was\ntempted to buy a plane\nticket to Spain or Greece\nfor a weekend just to treat\nmyself to some sun and\nsea. However, flight costs\ncan skyrocket to over\n\u00a3200 one way in summer,\neven with budget airlines\nlike Ryanair. Ain\u2019t paying\nthat! Luckily, the south\ncoast of England boasts\nlovely beach towns, some\nof which can easily rival\nthe popular Mediterranean\nresorts. Plus, they can be\na convenient last-minute\nchoice for a day trip on\nthose rare occasions\nwhen the temperatures in\nLondon reach the unbelievable 30o\nC.\nBournemouth\nThis lovely town was\na pleasant surprise to me.\nThe beaches in the region\nare sandy, although it\u2019s\non the same coastline as\nBrighton which I visited\na few years back and\nwhere I couldn\u2019t walk\nbarefoot on the sharp\npebbles (which felt more\nlike shards!). But Bournemouth is totally different:\nthe warm golden sand was\na pleasure to both walk on\nand look at. The tall cliffs\nwith fancy villas on top,\nseparating the seashore\nfrom the streets, offer\nbreath-taking views of the\nbeaches from above and\nare perfect spots to slow\ndown, relax, and enjoy the\nmoment.\nI didn\u2019t get to explore\nthe town much since I\nopted for the whole day\non the beach, enjoying the\nBeachbetterhavemymoney:affordableseasidedestinations\nsun, warm water, and a\nrefreshing sea breeze that\nwas much needed on such\na hot day. I walked along\nthe coast towards Poole (to\nthe west of Bournemouth)\nand was not disappointed\nby the mesmerising views\nof the sea on one side and\nthe cliffs on the other. To\nthis day, Bournemouth is\nmy #1 recommendation\nfor a beach trip in England\nBroadstairs\nBroadstairs is another\nseaside town with sand\nbeaches, located in the\nSouth-East, less than two\nhours away from London\nby train. It prides itself on\nbeing home to the Viking\nBay, where Charles\nDickens used to spend\nhis holidays back in the\nday. Despite being a small\ntown, it\u2019s a popular destination on hot summer\nweekends, especially\nfor families with small\nchildren, so the beach\nmight get a bit crowded\nand loud. Not to worry\nthough \u2013 you can still\nfind somewhat quieter\nand emptier places by the\nsea (walking a bit further\naway from the main beach\nwill do the trick). Also,\nthe place boasts amazing\nwhite cliffs, characteristic\nof South-East England,\nthat are a treat not only\nfor your eyes but also for\nyour Instagram feed (hey,\nno judgement, we all do\nit!).\nHastings\nSituated around a two\nand a half hour drive from\nLondon, Hastings offers a\nrange of leisure activities\nbesides sunbathing and\nswimming. The beach\nitself is pebbly, so may\nnot be as nice as the\nsandy ones mentioned\nbefore. But I visited the\nplace on a rather cool and\nwindy summer day, when\nswimming wasn\u2019t much\nof an option anyway, so\nWhite cliffs of Broadstairs // Edita Pileckyte\nEdita Pileckyte\nTravel Editor\nTRAVEL\ninstead we hiked up the\nhills via a trail that was officially closed (#thuglife)\nand savoured the beautiful\npanorama of the city and\nthe beach from above.\nWe also visited the\nruins of Hastings castle\nand spent some quality\ntime sitting and chatting\non the beach, with the\ncalming sound of waves\nin the background.\nSouthend-on-Sea\nProbably one of the\nclosest beach destinations\nto London, Southendon-Sea is not nearly as\nappealing as others. Both\nthe sand and the water are\nrather dirty, and the beach\nis full of broken glass and\nother rubbish. However, it\nhas the longest pier in the\nworld and is probably the\nmost convenient place to\ngo to by public transport.\nBut in my opinion, it\u2019s\nworth travelling a bit\nfurther from London for\na more fulfilling beach\nexperience.\nLast tips\nMost of the southern\nand south-eastern destinations are around two\nhours away from London\nand can be conveniently\nreached by direct trains\nor buses. You might even\nbe able to score some\naffordable train tickets,\nespecially to places like\nBroadstairs. And when\nyou go there, don\u2019t forget\nto get some fish and\nchips, an integral part\nof your British seaside\nexperience! But beware\nof seagulls \u2013 if you have\nfood on the beach, they\nwill definitely try to\nsnatch it from you, even if\nyou\u2019re holding it in your\nhands (been there one too\nmany times: getting my\nTesco meal-deal sandwich\nstolen was one of the\nsaddest moments of my\nlife).\nBournemouth beach resembles some resorts in Southern Europe // Edita Pileckyte Lost again but we always have each other // Niamh French\nEarlier this year we published a series of articles about a group of students hiking in Corsica, a challenging\nexpedition funded by IC Exploration Board.

Michail shielded his\neyes. I commando-rolled\naway as the flaming\nstove arched through the\nair and tumbled into the\nriver. Our pile of spilt rice\nwas instantly blackened.\nBetween our seven scientific minds it had not\noccurred to us to keep our\nstoves more than 15cm\napart from each other or\nour faces. The result was a\nrapidly expanding ball of\nflame. We had learnt our\nfirst lesson.\nWith a new level of\nrespect for health and\nsafety, we tucked into\nlentils, rice, onion, carrot,\nand some wispy poached\negg. We collected our\nwaste in a bin bag and\nwrapped the remaining\nbags around our backpacks to keep them dry.\nSleeping in a bivy bag\nis somewhat like being\nwrapped up in a sock\nthat\u2019s floating through\nspace. Every time you\nopen your eyes you are\nmet with a sea of stars,\ncrossed by the occasional\nsatellite and centered on\nthe moon. Only the scent\nof grass reminds you\nthat you\u2019re still on Earth.\nHowever, we woke to a\nless romantic scene. The\ncondensation of our breath\nhad left our bivy bags wet,\nand the cold night air was\npinching our noses. We\nlearnt our second lesson:\nwear balaclavas, and\nonly use a bivy bag if it is\nraining.\nThe clock struck 4am\nand we sprung awake,\npacking up under the light\nof our head torches and\nshivering sleepily. A quick\nhike back to Bellever Tor\nwarmed us up, and we\ntimed it perfectly with the\nsunrise. A deep stillness\nhung in the air, pierced\nonly by birdsong and\nthe stirring music from\nsomeone\u2019s phone. Not a\nword was spoken while\nthe glowing sun broke\nthe horizon. We were\nentranced.\nWe breakfasted on\ntahini, porridge, and nuts,\nwhile Carla smashed\nout a navigation crash\ncourse, preparing us to\ntake turns by guiding the\nteam around the moors.\nWe passed ancient archaeological sites, fell\ninto squelching bogs,\nand came dangerously\nclose to farm guard dogs.\nOur faces tanned and our\nspirits stayed high despite\nthe occasional blister.\nWhen lunchtime came,\nwe hopped across some\nstepping stones and\ndipped our feet in the cool,\nclear river. Our lunch was\nthe same as our previous\nnight\u2019s dinner, although\nnow more skillfully\ncooked and with no fire-re-lated panic. We scrubbed\nour pans clean with sand\nand river water, making\na mental note to pack\nbiodegradable soap and a\nscouring pad for Crete. As\nmuch as we would have\nliked to explore Dartmoor\nfurther, we needed to get\nback to the cars and our\nLondon lives.\nThe majestic sunrise was well worth the early start // Niamh French\nA couple of hours\nthrough forests and fields\nbrought our trip to an end.\nWe have come away with\nlessons learnt, a strong\nteam dynamic, and smiles\non our faces, now all the\nmore excited to begin our\nexpedition across Crete.\n\u201cEvery time\nyou open your\neyes you are\nmet with a\nsea of stars,\ncrossed by\nthe occasional\nsatellite and\ncentered on\nthe moon. Only\nthe scent of\ngrass reminds\nyou that you\u2019re\nstill of Earth\u201d\n\n"

Students\nwill need to be a member\nof that particular CSP\nbefore they are able to\nvote for the roles. Alongside this, a number of\nConstituent Union (CU),\nWellbeing Representation\nNetwork (WBRN), and\nAcademic Representation\nNetwork (ARN) roles also\nhave people running.\nHowever, there are\nseveral notable positions\nthat will be left unfilled\nfor the second election\ncycle in a row: this\nelection marks the second\ntime no candidates have\nput themselves forward\nfor the Union\u2019s LGBT+\nOfficer, one of the eight\nLiberation Officers, who\n\u201cworks to stop any discrimination against the\nLGBT+ community at\nImperial\u201d.\nAlessio Incitti, the\ncurrent LGBT+ Officer,\ntold Felix: \u201cEven though\nthis time the position was\npromoted individually on\nthe Union\u2019s social media,\nand I was contacted by\nsome potential candidates,\nsadly no-one ended up\nrunning.\u201d\nHe said the fact the\nLGBT+ Officer was the\nonly position left unfilled\n\u201cmeans that there is a\nproblem with the engagement of the LGBT+\ncommunity, and I hope it\nwon\u2019t be ignored by next\nyear\u2019s Officer Trustees.\nPersonally, I would encourage LGBT+ students\nto take the leap and run\nfor leadership positions\nlike this one. It has been\none of the most rewarding\nexperiences during my\ntime at Imperial.\u201d\nA significant proportion of candidates are\nrunning uncontested: in\ntotal, only around 40% of\nthe roles will be contested\nbetween more than one\ncandidate, while nearly\none third of submitted\ncandidates failed to\nprovide a manifesto on\nthe voting website.\nThe last election cycle\ntook place in March,\nand saw the election of a\nnumber of high-ranking\nroles, including sabbatical\nofficers.\nsessions \u2013 representing a\ntotal time of 594 hours \u2013\nbeing scheduled for MSc\nand MRes students across\nthe entire year.\nUnder Imperial\u2019s\nAcademic Timetabling\nPolicy, all Wednesday\nafternoons are to be kept\nfree from noon for all\ntaught students for \u201csport\nand society events and activities of a non-compul-sory nature,\u201d providing a\nwork-life balance.\nBurstow told Felix:\n\"Postgraduate taught\nstudents should be able\nto take part in the same\nactivities on Wednesday\nafternoons as their undergraduate counterparts\",\nfurther adding: \"It is\nunacceptable that some\ncourses continue to schedule teaching for taught\npostgraduates on Wednesday afternoons, despite\nthe academic timetabling\npolicy currently in place\u201d\nThe audit looked at\ntimetabling within the\nFaculty of Engineering,\nFaculty of Natural\nSciences, and Institute\nof Molecular Science &\nEngineering.

Physics was\nthe department with the\nhighest number of teaching sessions, 36, followed\nby Civil Engineering with\n33. Earth Science Engineering has the most hours\nper teaching session, with\nan average of nearly five\nhours, closely followed\nby Civil Engineering\nwith over three hours per\nteaching session.\nOne taught postgrad-uate, who has not taken\npart in any Wednesday\nafternoon activities this\nyear told Felix: \u201cI would\nhave liked to get involved\nin societies, and if I was a\nmember of sports teams I\nwould have been annoyed\n[by the scheduled teach-ing].

It\ndoesn\u2019t always hit the mark, but when it does it soars.\nT\nhere is something\nslightly off-put-ting about our\nsimian cousins\n\u2013 those gorillas, chimpan-zees, and bonobos who\nseem so human-like and\nyet also so distant from\nus. We know that many\nsuch species behave in\nways similar to humans\n\u2013 they exhibit complex\nsocial behaviour, are\nself-aware, and are able\nto communicate with us\nto a remarkably proficient\ndegree. At the same time,\nhowever, there remains\na distance between them\nand us, which catches\nat the back of the mind\n\u2013 perhaps it\u2019s a sense of\nthe uncanny, or how they\nremind us, unwelcomely,\nhow we are all merely\nanimals.\nThis idea of distance\nis present throughout\nAudrey Schulman\u2019s\nTheory of Bastards,\na dystopia-cum-dra-ma-cum-science-fiction\nbook based off a mountain\nof scientific research.\nEarly on in the novel,\nwe\u2019re presented with\na reminder of just how\npowerful these creatures\ncan be: Dr. Frankie Burk\nis a brilliant young evolutionary scientist, fresh\nfrom winning a MacArthur Genius Grant, who\nhas come to a research\nfacility in a near-future\nAmerica to study the\nmating habits of bonobos.\nOn her second day at the\nFoundation, she tries out a\ncarnival-style strength test\ngame, to see which animal\nshe\u2019s equivalent to \u2013 she\ngets the ring-tailed lemur,\nwhich weights only five\npounds. The bonobos\nshe\u2019ll be studying weigh\n70, meaning she\u2019ll need to\ntread carefully.\nBut, of course, Frankie\nis also hampered by the\nfact she\u2019s recovering from\nradical surgery to try and\ncure her endometriosis,\nwhich has caused her excruciating pain throughout\nher life, and hardened her\nattitudes to those around\nher.\nSchulman weaves\na complex narrative,\nlooping back and forth\nbetween Frankie\u2019s early\nlife, warped by her daily\npain, and her current\nresearch, related to her\ngroundbreaking \u2018theory\nof bastards\u2019 \u2013 the idea that\nwomen cheating on their\npartners has evolutionary\nbenefits for the species as\na whole. Alongside this\nwe\u2019re presented with a\nromance plot, a survival\ndrama, and a quasi-dysto-pian backdrop. It proves\nto be slightly too much\nat times, with different\nthemes developed\nhalf-heartedly in tandem,\nrather than individually\n\u201cFluid\ndescriptions\nof pain recur\nthrough the\nnovel, and are\nits strongest\nmoments\u201d\nand fully.\nSchulman writes with\na short, sharp prose style\n\u2013 contracted sentences\nfire out rapidly, drawing\nthe reader\u2019s attention on.\nThis method really comes\ninto its own with the\ndescriptions of pain and\nendometriosis Schulman\nuses throughout the book\n\u2013 it\u2019s probably one of the\nonly books I\u2019ve read that\ndeals so rawly with the\ncondition, which affects\n10% of women across\nthe globe. Schulman\nexplores how pain can be\nbeneficial \u2013 \u201cthe mother\nto us all, slapping us\nback from the hot stove,\nforcing us to put down\nthe sharp knife\u2026training\ncare into our bones\u201d \u2013\nbut that the chronic pain\nfelt by Frankie \u201cwas\nnot a mother. It was an\nabuser\u2026it wrapped itself\naround the ribs, settled on\nthe shoulders, a weight to\nbe borne\u2026pain like this\ndid not open up the world;\nit erased it bit by bit. Over\ntime it erased her love of\nyard sales, of eating, of the\nsimple act of laughing.\u201d\nFluid descriptions like\nthis recur throughout the\nnovel, and are by far its\nstrongest moments.\neveryone has implants\nthat essentially graft a\nsmart phone directly into\ntheir eyes. The hysteria\naround the technology\nnever quite reaches a\nfever pitch, which is a\ngood thing, since it makes\nthe developments that\nmuch more believable.\nBut references to outdated\nbioware, and mysterious\nsymbols that begin accumulating on Frankie\u2019s\nviewscreen \u2013 which we\npresume must symbolise\nsomething much more\nsinister than the need for\nan update \u2013 fail to develop\ninto anything substantial.\nSimilarly, we begin the\nnovel expecting to get\nmore of a backstory of\nher research assistant\nStotts \u2013 an ex-soldier who\nbrings a quiet reserve to\nthe research project \u2013 but\nthis isn\u2019t forthcoming.\nThere is a clear division\nbetween the two main\nsections of the book.\nFrankie starts by gaining\nthe trust of the bonobos\nshe is studying, gradually\ngetting more and more\nintegrated in their clique.\nIt is at this point where\nSchulman is at her best,\nbacked up by a dizzying\namount of research\nthat she outlines in an\naddendum at the end of\nthe novel. A catastrophe\nmidway through the novel\nshifts the tone to a survival\ndrama, highlighting in the\nprocess how reliant we all\nare on our technology. It\ndoesn\u2019t quite live up to the\npromiseofthefirstsection,\nand the satirical elements\nare slightly obvious, but\nit\u2019s still thrilling enough\nto keep the pages turning\nrapidly. In examining our\nrelationship with pain,\nwith each other, and\nwith modern technology,\nSchulman has a lot on\nher plate; while Theory of\nBastards doesn\u2019t always\nlive up to its potential,\nwhere it does, it soars\nspectacularly.\nTheory of Bastards centres around a group of bonobos in captivity // Wikimedia\nBOOKS\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nEuropa Editions. 403 pp.\nTHEORY OF BASTARDS\nby Audrey Schulman\nThere are a number\nof developments that\nSchulman doesn\u2019t quite\nfollow through \u2013 the\nworld Frankie and others\ninhabit is a near-future\nwhere self-driving cars\nare a practical reality, and\n\n"

Her slate drawings,\nhowever, are far more\nabstract, with titles\nfloating in each piece\nhelping the viewer anchor\ntheir interpretations to\nwhat would otherwise\nbe simple clouds. She\ndoes this with surprising\nefficacy.\nDean also creates space\nfor the softer feeling\nof nostalgia, with her\ncollections of \u2018Round\nStone\u2019 and \u2018Four, Five,\nSix, Seven and Nine leaf\nClover\u2019, which I feel\ngrounded the exhibition.\nThe care she put into\ncollecting, preserving,\nand organising these\notherwise meaningless\nobjects from childhood\ncould be keenly felt. It\nconjured up the feeling of\nbeing young and building\nyour world around small\nfound things. This curiosity and attention to the\nworld around us can get\nlost in adulthood. Dean\u2019s\ncuration brought a bit\nof that childlike wonder\nback: it was almost\nhumbling to see.\nDean then juxtaposes\nthese curations with my\nfavourite piece of the\nexhibition: the strong\n\u2018Quarantania (Mount\nof Temptation)\u2019. This\nstriking collage represents\na scene from the Christian\nbible, in which Jesus\nencounters the Devil in\nthe Judean Desert, and\nis tempted by him. Dean\nuses rich colour to depict\nthe scene, making it stand\nout from the rest of her\nlargely-monochrome\nexhibition. The piece\nis dynamic, angry, and\npainful, somehow portraying how Christ must have\nfelt without description or\nexplicit story telling.\nThe connection of\nmemories and emotion\nto landscapes and the\nworld culminates in her\nfinal piece, a hour-long\nfilm entitled \u2018Antigone\u2019.\nAntigone, incidentally\nalso the name of Dean\u2019s\nsister, was both the\ndaughter and sister of\nOedipus. She was a\nstrong woman, standing\nfor justice, but, as with\nmost Greek myths, was\ncaught in her family\u2019s\ntragedy and destined to\ndie. Dean fills out her\nstory using the film. We\nknow of Oedipus\u2019s story,\nwhich culminates in him\nblinding himself after he\nlearns of his atrocities;\nfrom here, Dean follows\nOedipus in his journey\nleading to Antigone, and\nher part in delivering him\nto the gods.\nFor Dean this film was\n20 years in the making,\nand stemmed from her\nexperiences in Utah at\na screenwriter\u2019s retreat.\nConversations with fellow\nwriters and the poet and\nclassicist Anne Carson,\nwhose poems form part\nof the script, shape this\nfilm; it is an exploration\nof her relationship with\nher sister, along with a\nmeditation on how fate\ninteracts with the world\n\u2013 which could be defined\nas landscape \u2013 to take you\nto your destination. The\nideas of fate, emotion, and\nof self-reflection from the\nother pieces in this exhibition are repeated like\na mantra here. Different\nvideos are played side by\nside, making it impossible\nto focus on either. This\nimmerses the viewer in\nsound and light, creating\na canvas on which the\nviewer can project their\nfeelings as Oedipus\ndelivers a monologue, but\ncan also become confusing and distracting.\nThis exhibition shows\nDean\u2019s range in the media\nsheusestoconveyhowthe\nworld we live in can affect\nus, as well as how we can\nuse it to affect our own\npersonal journey. There\nis often no clear narrative\nin Dean\u2019s pieces, and\nmany pieces are abstract\n\u2013 Dean simply invites us\nto reminisce and explore,\nwithout promising a tidy\nexplanation. No two\nvisitors will come away\nhaving experienced the\nsame thing.\nThe third of Tacita Dean\u2019s London shows highlights the artist\u2019s wide range of talents.\nTacita Dean,\u2018Antigone\u2019, 2018.
