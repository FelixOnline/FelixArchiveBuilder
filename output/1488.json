    "content": "hunting dogs; the history of English food is in\nevery aspect of this restaurant, so is its present,\nand undoubtedly its future.\nOur mains arrive. I have the Roast Turbot,\na revelation, and the boyfriend has the Spiced\nPigeon: both amply exceed our expectations.\nWe eat in contented half-sentences, punctuated with morsels on forks proffered across\nthe table and with whole explosions, every flavour in one bite, consumed slowly. The Roast\nTurbot is served with cockle ketchup and leaf\nchicory and makes me think of holidays, the\nsea, the English countryside. It is firm but\nembraces the tongue. As for the chicory and\ncockle ketchup, it hardly seems fair to describe\nthese as \u201caccompanying\u201d the roast turbot, or to\ndemote them to \u201cserved with\u201d. On his menu,\nBlumenthal avoids these words: initially this\nseems to be for minimalist, aesthetic reasons,\nbut it seems clear that in fact, these are not\nsides, or flavours: the dish is composed of all\nthree and may not miss a note.\nDessert is Tipsy Cake, a sort of souffl\u00e9-bread\npudding concoction, served with the infamous\nroast pineapple, which is caramelised and adds\na boozy edge to the fluffy cake, as well as Taffety Tart, served with rose, fennel, lemon and\nblackcurrant sorbet, with a crispy caramelised\ntop. Again, it is perfectly balanced, perfectly\ncomplemented, perfectly Dinner.\nWhen we leave, it is with the certainty that\nthis is the best place we have ever eaten. As\nHeston himself says, \u201cIf nothing else, I hope\nit\u2019s easy to remember\u201d. He was talking about\nthe name, but he couldn\u2019t have been more\nright.\nDinner by Heston Blumenthal, Mandarin\nOriental Hyde Park, 66 Knightsbridge, London, SW1X 7LA\nFELIX\n22\nFOOD\nFood Editors: Dana Li\nVicky Jeyaprakash\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 13 may 2011\nGastronomical Musings\nSummer is here and the skirts and sunglasses are\nout. Well for us girls at least, sorry boys \u2013 unless\nthat\u2019s your kind of thing, no judgement here). It also\nheralds the return of Pimms, ice lollies and the all\nimportant Frappuccino. Life is good. If pesky exams\ndo have to take over your life then let it be now,\nwhen large icy glasses of Fruli in the pub and Twister\nLollies in the park are acceptable revision breaks.\nWell, sort of. I think that\u2019s how other people feel.\nI won\u2019t lie and pretend all this sun is my thing.\nEverything in moderation and all that. The excuse to\neat enormous amounts of gelato is appreciated and\na sneaky trip to Oddono\u2019s in South Kensington is a\nmust for me. Two-for-one on waffles with ice cream\nand sauce, all for the same price as one scoop; bar-gain! I\u2019m all for making the most out of what there\nis on offer even while mourning the loss of my scarf\nand the need for hot cups of tea. If gelato is the only\nway, then so be it.\nSummer food lacks the utter comfort that winter\ngrub intrinsically has but the abundance of colour\nand variety makes the whole thing a far cheerier ex-perience. Salads, quiche, and the odd Eton mess\ncertainly ease the pain of the passing of parsnip\nchips until the end of the year. As does Pimms \u2013 oh\nwonderful ruby red Pimms, with your perfect timing\nand leaves of mint.\nOf course the ultimate in summer cuisine is the\nmeal that is an event in its self: the barbecue. BBQ\nand all it\u2019s accompaniments make the next couple\nof months exciting what with all the worry and drama over the potential for rain and the possibility of\nmeat being set on fire due to the drunken chef at\nthe grill, while hosting a lot of hungry people.\nIt\u2019s the only meal that never really starts when you\nget there but never seems to end; with lunch turning\ninto supper and the neighbour\u2019s angry yelling ending the night. I have yet to attend one this year that\nhas been successfully held outside but as someone\nwho is allergic to everything outdoors I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve\nbeen unhappy at this state of affairs. Don\u2019t even get\nme started on picnics. Ants and grass and often a\nfrisbee aimed at your head. Joy.\nBefore all of you label me the summer curmudgeon\n(a sort of ice queen scrooge-like figure if you will) I\nremind you that it is my duty as a British person to\ncomplain about the weather and all the annoyances\nit throws up. Can you imagine what I\u2019d have to say\nif I hadn\u2019t caught any sun today? Welcome summer.\nDinner at Heston\u2019s\nVicky says: Laura Huckins visits the fabled new restaurant sensation\nH\neston Blumenthal: the molecular gastronomist, the chef or\nperhaps the genius? Having\nburst onto our screens only a\nfew years ago, he has fascinated us with his original recipe ideas which\ncome complete with their own crazy experi-ences; birds flying out of a pie being one memorable highlight. A self-taught chef, Heston\u2019s\noriginal restaurant \u2018The Fat Duck\u2019 boasts\nthree Michelin stars, is consistently ranked\none of the world\u2019s best places to dine, and is\nafforded the luxury of unregulated prices. His\nmost recent addition to the family, \u2018Dinner\u2019 in\nthe Mandarin Oriental Hotel, ignited a frenzy\namongst food critics months before its opening in January this year, taking 6,000 bookings\nwithin its first day of opening the phone lines.\nLaura Huckins was lucky enough to visit.\nLong before I enter Dinner, I have done my\nresearch. After four years at Imperial I am\nan engineer worth my salt: alongside my Lit\nReview I have menus and quotes, and the\ndate pencilled into Outlook three months in\nadvance. Less than two weeks before we are\ndue to go, Dinner opens and the reviews come\nstreaming in: Giles calls it \u201cthe best restaurant\nin the world\u201d. AA Gill is in raptures. Suddenly,\nwith two days to go, our reservations are worth\nmore than that week\u2019s rent: a few hours later, a\npair of reservations are selling for \u00a3300. Luckily, it does not occur to us to sell them despite\nthe fact that we may not make rent this month,\nor that we only have two aubergines and some\nrice left. I cannot say I will ever regret it.\nWe told ourselves, to begin with, that we\nwould stick to the set menu: three courses,\ncooked by Heston (who had chief residency\nfor the first two weeks after opening): how\ncould we go wrong?. And then. Giles Coren\nhad the meat fruit. There are photos. Chicken\nliver parfaits, wrapped in mandarin flavoured\njelly. It even has a leaf... we are not, I realise,\nsticking to the set menu. We are going to have\nthe meat fruit, and the spit-roasted pineapple.\nThere are photos, snippets, read and re-read:\nthe meat fruit becomes, for the next few days,\nour Bettie Page, our Gyspy Rose Lee, our pin-up.\nI have however never peeled the soft outer\nlayer of a pin-up before, or bit in to find her\nsharp, soft, firm. We removed the leaf first and\nspread, gently almost, the sweet pate: every\nbite superb, a revelation. The boyfriend, I re-alise, is in love, and is not sharing. Good job\nthen that as well as this, we order the Salamagundy. Described as \u2018Chicken Oysters, Bone\nMarrow and Horseradish Cream\u2019, it strikes me\nas fuller, less coquettish, than meat dressed\nas a mandarin. It arrives, tiny melting slivers\nof meat with strong, fruity marrow and the\nperfectly complementing oh-so-fashionable\npuree/cream. We are, in short, enchanted, so\nmuch so that we barely notice Heston himself\nto our left, chatting to two men we recognise\nbut cannot name. He has new glasses, tortoise-shell, rather Victorian-deep-sea-diver-esque,\nand makes me wish that I had worn my own\nlabcoat to match.\nAt this point we pause, take in the scenery.\nWe recline, smile; starters over, we believe the\nhype, and begin appreciating the surroundings.\nTo the left, the kitchen, with its glass walls and\ngently spit-roasting pineapples: it puts one in\nmind of a more benign, charismatic Henry\nVIII settingw. Cog-like mobiles hang from\nthe ceiling and avoid any accidental forays\ninto the twee: the decor is sleek and reserved,\nno mock-tudor lamps or plush rugs depicting\nThe mighty meat fruit. A strange beast it is true but tasty and succulent and orange. We welcome it to our table. Hello\nflickr/laissez faire\nflickr/darcie\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n10\nPOLITICS\nPolitics Editors: Rory Fenton\nJoseph Letts\nRajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 13 May 2011\nMassacre in Kenya\nShe didn\u2019t stand a chance. Carrying underarm\nthe small goat she was hoping to trade, Akiru\ncould only join the other traders as they were\nrounded up in a small village along Ethiopia\u2019s\nborder with Kenya. The following morning she\nwas one of twenty Kenyans carried away in bin\nbags by Catholic missionaries in a tractor. She\nwas shot at close range.\nHer twenty companions joined a total of 40\nkilled on a day of unforeseen and unprecedented violence between the northern Kenyan Turkana people and the southern Ethiopian Merille. What started with the unprovoked murder\nof two Turkana fishermen exploded through a\nspiral of revenge into the massacre of these unarmed traders just hours later.\nLike the rest of the Turkana dead, Akiru was\nfrom Todonyang, a small village turned refugee camp just a few kilometres from the bor-der. The people of Todonyang are no strangers\nto suffering since conflict flared up with the\nMerille during a severe drought in 2009. Both\ncommunities rely heavily on keeping goats and\nwhen grass became scarce, conflict arose over\nthe remaining patches, which happened to be\non Turkana land. Merille attacks, taking animals and land, would kill several Turkana each\nmonth. On top of this, HIV prevalence is 25%\namong the 500 or so herdsmen and fishermen\nin Todonyang and police, stationed nearby to\nprotect against conflict with the Merille, had\nbrought the problems of drugs, alcohol and\nprostitution to the village. A proud nomadic\npeople, the Turkana had been forced by the\ntrouble with the Merille to seek safety in num-bers, gathering at Todonyang.\nIn recent months, however, real hope had\nbeen building. Efforts at peace talks sponsored\nby Steven Ochieng, a Catholic priest, seemed\nto be paying off as Turkana and Merille started\ntentatively to visit each others villages to trade.\nThere hadn\u2019t been violence for months. A new\nschool had just been built to teach Turkana and\nMerille children together. For Akiru, the opportunity to trade with her former enemies presented a real chance to break out of poverty. As the\nwife of a fisherman, Akiru and her family of 6\nwould have earned around \u00a3300 per year; even\nthe smallest amount of extra income would\nmake a substantial difference to this young\nfamily\u2019s meagre earnings.\nBut the Turkana and Merille were still a desperately poor people living from day to day,\nand endemic poverty can lead to panicked,\nshort term decision making. Last Tuesday\nmorning, while Akiru set out for the Merille\nvillage, a group of young Merille men left that\nsame village for the shores of Lake Turkana.\nIt is not certain what motivated them, but the\nprospect of returning as war heroes, as young\nmen everywhere fantasise, was likely one of\nthem. They ambushed a group of Turkana fish-ermen, killing two of them. When word spread\nto Todonyang, five unarmed Merille traders\nwere killed in cold blood.\nThere is a terrible inevitability about the\nconflict. Desperate poverty is entrenched by\ncorrupt government. The failure to provide\ndecent schools and law enforcement is leading to murder over mere grazing land. Poverty\nand the threat of violence devalue life for both\nTurkana and Merille. As Yeats said, \u201ctoo long\na sacrifice makes a stone of the heart\u201d. Akiru\nreached the Merille village just minutes before\nthe news of the murder in Todonyang reached\nthere too. Not knowing the Merille language,\nshe probably didn\u2019t know what was happening\nwhen she was taken away from the village with\nthe other Turkana.\nBut even had she spoken their language, the\nwheel had been long set in turn, leading to an\nunarmed mother, goat in hand, dying for tradition and a patch of grass. She didn\u2019t stand a\nchance.\nRory Fenton\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nSyria\nU\nganda\u2019s lawmakers have begun debate on the\ncontroversial Anti-Homosexuality Bill and could\nvote on it as early as this week. The bill is currently in its second Parliamentary reading. One\nof the bill\u2019s main backers, Pastor Martin Ssempa\nurged the Government to pass the bill but says that\nhe no longer supports the death penalty for homosexual acts. Critics of the bill which includes foreign\ngovernment and some local pastors have said that\nit would not stop homosexuality and will adversely\nimpact the nation\u2019s fight against HIV. Uganda is considered to be a conservative nation.\nUganda\nSyria has started\nmoving columns\nof tanks to the\nrestive city\nof Hama after\nweeks of anti-Government pro-tests. Reports\nfrom Syria have\nsaid that water,\nelectricity and telephone lines have been cut off to\nthe city of Baniyas and troops are busy rounding up\nand interrogating youths as part of the crackdown\nagainst the protests. The European Union has announced an arms and personnel embargo on Syria\nin response to the crackdown. However, President\nAssad is not on the sanction list following objections\nfrom Germany and Spain.\nJapan\nJapan has announced that it will reconsider its energy policy following the accident at Fukushima\nplant. The plant has been leaking radiation since\nthe March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami\ndamaged cooling systems to the reactors. The accident is expected to cost TEPCO up to \u00a362 billion\nin compensation claims. Nuclear power currently\nprovides about 1/3 of Japan\u2019s energy needs and\nwill continue playing a significant role in the future\naccording to Japan\u2019s\nPrime Minister. However, Japan will invest more in renewables following the\naccident and expects\n20% of its energy\nneeds to come from\nrenewables by 2030.\nThe Turkana people of northern Kenya\n40 unarmed people killed as tribal violence escalates\nA Turkana herdsman watches his flock\n\n"

Unless otherwise specified,\nyou\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player plug-in\nwhich can be installed from http://get.adobe.com/\nflashplayer/.\nT\nhe year is 2020 and climate\nchange has reached critical levels.\nThe global temperature is rising,\nthe Maldives are being evacuated,\nand countries have realised that\ntheir individual efforts are no longer enough.\n2018 brought what scientists called the world\u2019s\nfirst ever \u201chypercane\u201d, and the serious possibility of dangerously high temperatures by 2100,\nalong with growing economic uncertainty, is\nleading to growing civil unrest.\nSomething must be done, and so the Global\nEnvironment Organisation (GEO) is formed\n\u2013 an independent, but slightly controversial\norganisation with the goal of countering the\nincreasing effects of climate change. And with\nthem they bring a newly elected President \u2013\nyou. Your first order of business is to decide\nhow you would like to be addressed (ranging\nfrom Darling and Dude, to Learned One and\nYour Excellency), then it\u2019s straight into saving\nthe world.\nThe way you go about it is to hire representatives in major regions around the world\n(Europe, Russia, Middle East etc.) to carry out\nyour bidding. Once hired, you can play one\n\u2018card\u2019 per representative from a set currently\navailable in that region. Each of these cards\nrepresents a project that the representative will\ncarry out over the next five years, leading to\nlong-term positive and/or negative effects in\nthat region, such as a change in GDP or carbon\nemissions, or even global mega-death.\nIt does all sound a bit like a dictatorship, and\nto that end the GEO and its representatives\ncan be kicked out and banned from a region\nif its population doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re acting\nin their best interests. This is one of the ways\nFate of the World manages win and loss conditions \u2013 lose control of too many regions and\nyou fail the level. Most win conditions must\nbe achieved by a specific year (and there are\nbonus ones for extra points), and your funds\nare generally very limited, so there\u2019s real pressure to play the right cards in the right places.\nThe system is conceptually rather simple \u2013\nplay cards and click next \u2013 but developer Red\nRedemption have added a great deal of complexity really quite well. In addition to the\nsleuth of statistics available for each individual\nregion \u2013 and on a global scale \u2013 every \u2018turn\u2019 of\nfive years you get major news stories from that\nregion. These headlines provide you with even\nmore insight into public opinion, and the general state of things, and it\u2019s from here that you\nwill probably be harvesting most of the information that you need to plan your next move.\nIt\u2019s easy to see that this game requires a lot\nof thought. You are guided in with only two\nregions, and a large number of cards to play\nwith, but you should enjoy the simplicity while\nit lasts. Once you\u2019ve finished the first level,\nyou get chucked in at the deep end \u2013 the whole\nworld is yours to look after (or control, if you\nprefer, Your Excellency) with a tight budget\nand only a handful of cards in play.\nIt\u2019s a steep learning curve, and with so many\ndifferent strategy paths to try out, it\u2019ll probably\ntake a few attempts to get it right. But once\nyou get going, it\u2019s quite satisfying to see your\nplans unfolding before your eyes. The whole\nsystem makes sense \u2013 there is clear logic to\nthe cards mechanism, requiring you to set up\neach region\u2019s infrastructure first. From here,\nyou can begin shaping that region\u2019s future \u2013 be\nit an unpopular, highly-taxed one to get funds,\nor a flourishing technologically advanced one.\nWith all these decisions to make and imple-ment, it\u2019s important that the interface is helpful\nand unobtrusive, and Fate of the World does this\nwell. It\u2019s quite clean and navigating through the\ngame is simple, with no more than a few clicks\nto get to any of your resources. There are little,\nfinishing touches \u2013 like playing region-themed\nbackground music when you\u2019re making decision in that area \u2013 that let you know the frontend has had attention too. There\u2019s even a heat\nmap of the entire Earth so you can keep track\nof which countries are contributing the most to\nglobal warming, but the emphasis here is definitely on the detailed underlying mechanics.\nWith so much of the premise relying on the\ncore gameplay, it\u2019s so important that it feels\nstrong and offers a good experience, and Fate\nof the World certainly delivers on that front.\nNot only that, but it manages to deliver a game\nbased on a really interesting concept \u2013 one that\nlinks well to our own, current conditions, and\nis possibly even trying to make a point about a\nfuture that our actions could take us.\nI really would recommend FotW, even if this\ngenre isn\u2019t your usual tipple. Having to think\nabout your various strategies and the solid\ngameplay makes this game one to look out for.\nFate Of The World is available now from\nwww.fateoftheworld.net, for about \u00a310.\nWho knew climate change\ncould be so much fun?\nChris Bowers becomes a global dictator while reviewing Fate of the World\nAll you need to be a world leader is to be able to use Google Earth\nHypercane? More like hyper-LAME! For those drowning guys, I mean\nNyan Cat Fly!\nnyancatfly.com\nThere are two groups of people in the world: those\nthat know what Nyan Cat is, and those that do not.\nFor the former, this game is a dream come true:\nguide the titular kitty on it\u2019s journey through space,\nnomming treats as you go. For the latter, it\u2019s the\nstart of a hellish nightmare of Japanese music and\nanimated GIFs from which there is no real escape.\nTreats get you bonus points, whereas slurping\ndown vegetables loses you a life. Really, it\u2019s no\nwonder kids are getting obese these days. Apart\nfrom the inexcuseable soundtrack, Nyan Cat FLY!\nis actually very good at what it does and there\u2019s a\ngood amount of fun to be had as the game speeds\nup and dodging rogue leeks gets more and more\nchallenging.\nReimagine :The Game:\ntinyurl.com/67bvapx\nIf my gran ever comes out of her irreversible coma,\nI won\u2019t show her the BBC News website, or give her\na copy of today\u2019s paper, I\u2019ll just sit her down in front\nof this old-style platformer. The past few years of\npopular culture, from Lady Gaga to Julian Assange,\nhave been compressed down into bitsize gaming\nnuggets, each with their unique flair.\nFor example, pictured above is a level about the\nBP oil spill, where pelicans must be used to sponge\nup oil and are then burnt in furnaces to allow the\nplayer to jump higher. Lots of good humour and satire here, and plenty of fun levels to keep you going.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 11\nPOLITICS\nFRIDAY 13 MAY 2011\nI\n\u2019m looking at the Canadian election results and can\u2019t help but\nfeel slightly jealous. This time\nlast year, after the debates, the\nLib Dems were looking at a surge\nsimilar to the New Democratic Party\u2019s\n(NDP) surge, and Labour looked like\nit was heading towards electoral obliv-ion. The NDP has pulled off what the\nLib Dems, and before that, the (British)\nLiberals, have dreamed of for almost a\ncentury \u2013 of destroying the comfortable\ntwo-party system (which, granted, was\nalways weaker in Canada because of\nthe Bloc Quebecois), and throwing the\ncountry\u2019s electoral system wide open.\nThere were, of course, many subtle\ndifferences that meant that what the\nNDP managed in Canada could never\nhave been replicated in the UK last\nspring. For a start, the (Canadian) Liberals were sick \u2013 infighting and uncertainty had churned through four party\nleaders since 2006, and the Liberals had\nbeen tarred by scandals from their last\ntime in office. The once \u201cNatural Party\nof Government\u201d has been left with a rut\nof 30 or so seats, mostly in the maritime\nprovinces, from their previous 120.\nCanada has also been a country where\nvoters have long had a tradition of completely wrecking unpopular parties \u2013 the\npresent Canadian Conservative party\nrose from the ashes of the Progressive\nConservatives in the 1990s, which was\nignominiously thrown out of power in\n1993, winning only 2 seats in the Lower\nHouse, and the Progressive Conservatives had in turn arisen from the ashes of\nthe old Conservative Party in the 1940s.\nFinally, the NDP had easy, low hanging fruit \u2013 Quebec, Canada\u2019s 2nd most\npopulous state, which had been poisonous ground for the Liberals, and too\nsocial democratic for the Tories, and\ntherefore usually elected representatives from the Bloc Quebecois \u2013 a broad\ncoalition united only by support for\nQu\u00e9b\u00e9cois sovereignty. When a cred-ible, 3rd (well, 4th) party alternative\nemerged, one that actually had views\nwhich resonated with the population,\nthe voters deserted the separatist bloc\nand plumped for the NDP \u2013 more than\nhalf of the NDP\u2019s gains this election\ncame at the Bloc\u2019s expense.\nThe NDP is not the equivalent of the\nLib Dems \u2013 it is the Canadian equivalent of Old Labour and still firmly\nrooted in social democratic traditions.\nIt is the defeated Liberals who occupy\nthe political ground most similar to the\nLib Dems. The Liberals faced a squeeze\nfrom both sides of the spectrum \u2013 the\nright was buoyed by Harper\u2019s competent economic management \u2013 Canada\nescaped the worst of the financial crisis,\nmostly due to the tighter regulations\nof banks that were brought in during\nthe last Liberal government, and the\nresource boom that is fuelling China\u2019s\ngrowth. The rise of the NDP in Quebec\ncaused many left-leaning Liberals to reconsider their votes and plump for the\nNDP instead.\nAnd yet, despite the hope and optimism of NDP supporters today, there\nare several potential problems on the\nhorizon. Most prominent is the government itself \u2013 it important to keep\nin mind that despite the NDP\u2019s suc-cess, Stephen Harper won the elec-tion. Harper has proved himself to be\nwilling to use \u201cdirty\u201d constitutional\ntricks. He avoided an earlier vote of\nno-confidence by asking the GovernorGeneral to suspend parliament. The\nConservatives have shown scant regard\nfor the environment, opting to continue\nproducing oil from Albertan tar sands\n\u2013 an environmental catastrophe, both\nin terms of the waste from the extraction process and the dirtiness of the fuel\nitself. Harper has also pushed forward\na conservative domestic agenda \u2013 getting \u201ctough on crime\u201d, and promising to\nbuild more prisons despite crime rates in\nCanada being the lowest in many years.\nThis is also the first election in almost\na decade that has produced a majority\ngovernment \u2013 since 2003, every Canadian election (all under FPTP, I might\nadd) has resulted in a hung parliament.\nHarper can now rule without cross-party\nsupport for its policies \u2013 in his previous\ntwo terms, Harper has had to act in a\nmore restrained manner in order to secure cross party support to get his bills\npassed in the Commons.\nAnd in the end, Canada might just\nhave turned into the UK \u2013 a country\nBreaking a two-party system\n\u201c[\u2026] Naturally the majority did notice\nhis criminal activity [\u2026] unfortunately,\nItalian People, if they have to choose\nbetween their duty and personal ad-vantage, always chose the latter. He, a\nmediocre, rough man with vulgar but\neffective eloquence was and is a perfect\nspecimen of his coevals. In an honest\ncountry he would have been at most the\nleader of a modest party, the not-too-brilliant author of verbose articles in his\nparty newspaper, he would have been\nconsidered a ridiculous character for his\nmanners, his megalomania, his offense\nto common sense due to his emphatic\nand shameless style.\n[\u2026] In Italy he became head of the\ngovernment. It is hard to find a better\nexample of an Italian.\nHe is weak but he admires the use of\nforce, he tries to appear strong against\nhis nature. He is venal, corruptible, adu-lator, catholic without believing in God,\ncorruptor, presumptuous, conceited,\njovial, [\u2026], good family man but with\nnumerous lovers.\n[\u2026] He uses those he despises and he\ndespises (and sometimes fears) those\nwho are honest, sincere, intelligent, because he does not need them. He laughs\nat them, he withdraws them. He surrounds himself of dishonest people and\nwhen these make him fall into ruin, they\nbetray him (as their nature dictates), he\nwhimpers to be innocent and cheated\n[\u2026]. \u201d\nThe passage above describes\nBerlusconi impeccably. When\nin 1994 he was first elected ,he\nrepresented the change from\n40 years of \u2018politicians by profession\u2019 to \u2018professionals\ninto politics\u2019: he introduced economists, lawyers and entrepreneurs\ninto his cabinet and he\nprioritised the interests of\nthe middle-high bourgeoisie with his low-tax liberal\npolitics. He used his popular\nsupport and political power to\nsave himself from his many\njudicial problems. He decriminalised\nfraud making it impossible to convict\nentrepreneurs who falsify company\u2019s\nbudgets, he tried in many ways to obtain\nimmunity from prosecution and now he\nhas paralysed the parliament in order to\npass a retroactive law to decrease dramatically the statue of limitation if the\ndefendant is a first offender and save\nhimself from a corruption trial.\nWith his able use of the media (he\nowns an exten- sive network\nof media outlets), a populist media campaign made of resounding declarations,\nvideo messages to the nation speaking\nof prosperity and efficiency that ignored reality, and with an alliance with\nthe \u2018Northern League\u2019 who give a voice\nto the discontent of the rural population\nof the north, he managed to broaden his\nappeal to the lower classes.\nAt first his family newspapers and\ntelevisions started limiting the voice of\nthe opposition, now they openly peddle\npropaganda and the trend is moving to\nstate television too: the director of the first national news is\nso lined up with the government that when the latest in\nBerlusconi string of sex scandals arose, there was no mention on state news: no\nreference to the phone\ninterceptions, the cars,\napartments hundreds\nof thousands of Euros,\npublic placements that\nBerlusconi gave to tens\nof soubrettes and show-girls, some of whom were underage, as\n\u2018charity gifts\u2019.\nThe sex scandal did, finally, crack his\nimmense popularity. Nevertheless he\nhas not resigned and many still defend\nhim, especially the old Catholic block:\nthose that were so easily disgusted by\ngreater rights for unmarried couples\nand homosexuals are now the toughest\ndefenders of \u2018Bunga Bunga\u2019 (evidently\nCatholics are used to delegating to others the use of their brains).\nI did vote for him, it was for interest\nand because the alternative was weak\nbut now I have realised my mistake:\nwhile Berlusconi is stepping over the\nvalues of the Republic, transforming\nthe parliament into a goat market, Italians have to open their eyes and find\na credible alternative. The situation is\nbecoming dangerously similar to something that in this country we all fear,\nsomething that we all studied in history\nbooks and heard from the tales of our\ngrand parents. By the way, the passage\nwas written in 1945 by Elsa Morante, it\ntalks about Mussolini\u2026\nwhere a centre-right party is in power\nfor much of the time because of the split\nin the vote of the centre-left between two\nlarge, credible parties resulting in many\nwasted votes under FPTP. In many seats\n(such as Etobicoke-Lakeshore, the seat\nof defeated Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff), the combined Liberal-NDP vote\nwould have been more than enough for\na candidate to secure a comfortable ma-jority, but the Tories snuck in because of\nthe ideological unity of the right.\nSo Bravo, Jack Layton, because he\nhas achieved the dream of every third\nparty leader in many first past the post\ncountries for many a year, for destroying the old comfortable consensus between the Tories and the Liberals, and\nfor almost tripling the number of seats\nheld by his party in a single election.\nThis is a tectonic shift in the shape of\nCanadian politics, not only had the Liberals been crushed on home ground, but\nthe destruction of the Bloc is a blow\nfor Quebecois independence \u2013 not that\nit was a realistic possibility in the first\nplace. For all that, the NDP still has\nsome way to go before it finds itself in\ngovernment, and I wouldn\u2019t discount\nthe Liberals just yet. The third party\ndream might prove all too fleeting.\nBlasta from the pasta?\nMarcello Colombino\nBerlusconi\u2019s disregard for democracy is reminiscent of another Italian strongman\nCanada\u2019s NDP has done what the Lib Dems couldn\u2019t says Tagore Nakornchai\n\u201cThe NDP has pulled\noff what the Lib\nDems have dreamed\nof for almost a century \u2013 destroying the\ntwo-party system\u201d\n\n"

But the Depression is affecting\nhis business, and soon Mildred finds\nthat his material needs are also being\ncovered by her. Pearce is an effectively\nboozy, aimless boyfriend whose pride\nis severely hurt by how Mildred starts\ntreating him as a dependant. Being a\nman, his ego is a sizable and it becomes\nmore and more difficult for him to accept that he is not the millionaire he\nused to be.\nThe technical accomplishments are\nalso worth mentioning \u2013 the set, costumes and music all perfectly evoke the\n30s grim but hopeful mood of a struggling but slowly recovering America.\nLike its core plot development, the music is never overdone nor does it ever\nfeel manipulative. Careful attention is\nalso given to the wardrobe, as Mildred\u2019s\nfinancial status constantly changes\nfrom episode to episode. The extravagance of its various supporting characters gives Haynes the chance to splash\nsome bright colours and shiny dresses\non screen, providing a clear, noticeable\ncontrast from its usual restricted use of\ndarker tones.\nHas HBO\u2019s gamble paid off? It certainly wasn\u2019t a ratings grabber, but will\nthe quality behind this masterful work\nbe recognised come September when\nthe Emmys announce their winners?\nGranted, five hours is not easy to sit\nthrough in one go, but Mildred Pierce\nis a quietly absorbing drama with many\neffective touching moments that carefully treats its fiery emotional scenes\nso as to not make them overly melodra-matic.\nand older (Morgan Turner and Evan Rachel Wood respectively) are terrifyingly\nmonstrous in every scene. Watching the\nyoung Turner slap her own mother so\nproudly and naturally is one of the film\u2019s\nbiggest shockers. She seems sweet and\nobedient at times, but this is all a part\nof her act. Filled with greed and hatred,\ntheir performances are disturbingly real,\nand the character of Veda instantly becomes someone whose head you want\nto put through a wall.\nMildred doesn\u2019t have many friends, as\nshe is so distracted by focusing on becoming the perfect mother, as well as a\nsuccessful businesswoman. But the two\nreliable women she can always count\non her Ida and Lucy (Melissa Leo),\nher neighbour. Ida is the more straight-talking, professional working woman,\nwhereas Lucky provides a warm voice\nand a shoulder for Mildred to cry on.\nBoth supporting stars, mature and polished in their craft, deliver finely tuned\nperformances that fit in convincingly\nwith the period mood.\nLove does seem to find Mildred again,\nwith Monty Beragon (Guy Pearce), a\nrich, lazy burn-out being the main canA\ndapted once again from\nJamesA. Cain\u2019s celebrated novel, this time as a\n5-part HBO mini-series,\nMildred Pierce must\nhave been a tricky one to map out. Its\nfirst adaptation in 1945 won Joan Crawford her much-deserved Oscar and was\nfurthermore nominated for Best Picture.\nSo naturally the pressure is on, both for\nthe director and cast, especially Kate\nWinslet who takes on the title role, but\nthe film\u2019s restrained, patient approach is\nmore than satisfying to warrant a seal of\napproval on this remake. Todd Haynes\n(director) follows the book more closely\nas it portrays almost every single aspect\nof the book in sequence, and can afford\nto take its time. After all, Haynes has\nover five hours to spread around.\nMildred Pierce (Winslet) is the traditional 30s middle-class housewife\nwhose sole job is to please her family,\nin this case, her husband and two young\ndaughters. When her cheating husband\ntakes it a step too far though, she feels\nenough is enough. After kicking him\nout of the house, she feels the financial restraint The Great Depression has\nbrought about. Struggling to balance\nher desire for a job and her pride that\ndoesn\u2019t let her work in what she considers a demeaning profession, she finally\nlands a job as a waitress. Under the\ntough guidance of Ida (Mare Winningham), the head waitress, Mildred finds\nher life\u2019s calling and decides to properly enter the restaurant business. And\nso \u201cMildred\u2019s Chicken and Waffles\u201d\nopens, to overwhelmingly good recep-tion. Soon she expands all over Los Angeles and it appears things are starting\nto look up. But this is until her eldest\ndaughter Veda starts causing trouble. A\nmaterialist sociopath, Veda\u2019s evil nature\nsurfaces even when she\u2019s a small child.\nHer angelic looks are devilishly decep-tive, as her own ambitions for an extravagant lifestyle take over.\nSo why should we pay attention for\nfive hours? The presence of Winslet is\na good enough reason. From the moment she appears, she commands your\nattention and her intense performance\nis difficult to ignore. That she can so\neffortlessly slip into the role of a struggling housewife is impressive enough,\nbut throughout the five separate parts\nher character is forced to evolve, and\nis hit with unthinkable challenges. All\nthese changes are captured brilliantly by\nWinslet, whose relentless energy shines\nthrough with dialogue and is just as effective in the many silent close-ups.\nIn the equally challenging role of\nVeda, the two actresses, both younger\nIf you\u2019re going to buy the rights to The Big C, then damn well advertise it!\nOmg, I just argued for more advertising...

When it airs other networks\u2019 productions they are often\nstolen by Rupert Murdoch e.g. Sky 1\nacquiring 24 after its second season.\nWhen we look at ITV the word \u201csoaps\u201d\nmust be used whilst Channel 5 is the\nland of CIS, NICS and any-other-let-ters-IS. But when we get to Channel 4\nit\u2019s a fun mix of originals, adaptations\nand great American shows that they\nseem intent on killing.\nIt seems that when C4 adapts an\nAmerican show, they do well. Sure with\nDeal or No Deal they took off the 26\nleggy models holding suitcases in small\ndresses and replaced them with the general public and boxes (sorry guys) but it\nstill worked.\nThey can even come up with good\nideas like The Million Pound Drop,\na game show where people bet \u00a31million cash on what they feel is the right\nanswer. It makes good TV, although\nthe contestants\u2019 choices do make\nyou scream at the TV \u2013 someone put\n\u00a3375,000 on Karaoke not being a Japanese word when I last saw it.\nBut the issue I have the C4 is its longstanding habit of buying some of the\nfinest TV shows from the US and giving them a thoroughly undeserved UK\nTV death.\nThe best example of this is The Big\nC, a comedy with the tag line \u2018Grab life\nby the balls\u2019 that wanted to make cancer\nfunny. Now I know what your thinking,\ncomedy and cancer sounds like the field\nof South Park and Family Guy, but\nthis non-animated piece of televisual\ngold worked staggeringly well.\nIt follows a run-of-the-middle suburban wife and mother who discovers\nshe has terminal cancer and decides to\nlive life to the max. She withdraws her\npension and goes on wild and fun ex-periences, doing the things she always\nwanted to do. Never before has a show\nmanaged to make me laugh so much\nabout so serious an issue. The icing on\nthe cake came from the final episode\nof the where the show crossed that famously difficult boundary of any com-edy: seriousness. I suspect no person\nwho watched it had a dry eye when the\ncredits rolled; even I struggled!\nWhat C4 did with this show instead\nwas their standard \u2018this could be a really good show\u2019 strategy: Air it for a\nbit of C4 at a weird time (11pm); use\nminimal advertising; then shove it onto\nMore4 when the ratings are low. Now\nMore4 is still easily accessible, so you\nmay question why I actually care. But\nfirstly this strategy has been an annoying part of C4 for years and secondly\nthe Americans have a habit of switching\noff amazing shows, we don\u2019t need the\nBrits doing it too. I am sure with enough\nUK pressure we wouldn\u2019t have lost Arrested Development.\nSo who else has suffered from Channel 4s touch of death? The list is most\ndefinitely long: Aaron Sorkin has doubly felt it with both The West Wing\nand Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip;\nABC\u2019s Brothers and Sisters may\nhave won 10 awards but it apparently\ndoesn\u2019t deserve any prime time slots;\nHBOs Curb your Enthusiasm is a\nsolid More4 fixture and I think its fair\nto say the magic of Friends has gone\nafter non-stop showings on E4.\nSo what do I think Channel 4 should\ndo? Clearly its strength is not in showing good American shows and the audience doesn\u2019t expect them to provide\nthem. Maybe they should allow ITV,\nwhich needs as much help as it can\npossibly get, to take a few or at least\nrebrand More4 to 4USA (US4 would\nwork too). Either way they need to\nstop preventing people from seeing\nshows like The Big C otherwise the\nworld of TV lovers, myself included,\nwill never forgive them.\nMy plea to Channel 4:\nstop ruining good TV\nScott Heath\nJohn Park reviews the latest adaptation of James\nA.

    "content": "FELIX 9\nSCIENCE\nFriday 13 may 2011\nIn a pioneering step towards achieving food security a team of American and French scientists, including members from Harvard and the University\nof Minnesota, have unveiled the first sequenced\nrust fungi genomes.\nRust fungi infect the cells of their host plants, taking nutrients from the plant and causing losses in\nyield that are often devastating to a harvest. Selective breeding and genetic engineering have created\nmany rust resistant varieties of the crops we use today but the rust evolves quickly and there are strains\nwe have not been able to control. The scientists hope\nthat unravelling the genomes of the poplar leaf rust\nfungus (Melampsora larici-populina) and wheat\nstem rust fungus (Puccinia graminis) will lead to\nmore successful attempts to control these strains\nwhich are damaging both economically and in terms\nof biofuel production and food security.\nWheat stem rust has long been a threat to food\nsecurity. The fungus can reproduce asexually in\nthe wheat plant during the whole summer, producing spores that can spread over vast distances in a\nsingle year. Infected plants suffer from a reduced\nyield and, if severe, can result in an early death.\nThe effect on the food production of a country\ncan be devastating. So much so, that in the 1950s\nthe US developed a biological bomb designed to\nspread wheat stem rust and cause havoc in the infected country.\nPoplar leaf rust threatens the use of fast growing poplar trees as biofuel as well their value in the\nwood industry. The rust fungus affects the general\nhealth of the trees, limiting their growth and resulting in a reduced profit for the plantation.\nThe team of scientists have predicted several proteins similar to known proteins in other pathogens.\nSome of these are expected to be involved in the\nactual infection of the plant and the way in which\nthe fungi enter the cells. Others are transport proteins which enable the fungi to steal nutrients from\ntheir hosts. There are, however, some missing proteins which suggest the reasons that the fungi rely\non their hosts is related to them being unable to take\nup some nutrients in the forms found outside the\nplants. This also partly explains why the rust fungi\ncould not be grown in vitro in the lab, a challenge\nthat the team had to overcome during the project.\nOne of the great successes of the Green Revolution was the development of rust resistant wheat\nvarieties. Currently, a new, highly virulent strain,\nUg99, threatens global wheat production, particularly in many African countries. The identification\nof proteins resulting from the genome sequencing\nwill aid understanding of the way in which the rust\nfungi infect their hosts, obtain nutrients from them,\nand overcome plant defences. This will in turn help\nto develop new resistant strains of wheat and poplar plants and restore yield levels.\nRusty fungi genome gets a polish off\nAlex Jenkin\nResearchers have found a component of gut mucus that is toxic to parasitic worms. The discovery\ncould help one billion people worldwide.\nThe research, published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, found that just one component of\nthe mucus, a mucin known as Muc5ac, is needed\nfor the efficient expulsion of worms from the body.\nParasitic worms living in the gut are a major\ncause of disease. The gut is protected by a thick\nlayer of mucus that is a mixture of salts, water and\nlarge proteins called mucins. Muc5ac mucin is\nrarely found in the gut, but when it is it physically\nchanges the properties of the mucus barrier.\nScientists from the University of Manchester\nstudied whipworm infections in the guts of mice.\nThey discovered that mice that could not produce\nthe mucin Muc5ac were unable to expel the worms\nfrom their guts and suffered long term parasitic\ninfections. Professor Richard Grencis, one of the\nlead authors on the study, explained that Muc5ac\nis so important because \u201cit is \u2018toxic\u2019 for the worms\nand damages their health.\u201d\nThe researchers went on to find that Muc5ac is\nharmful to several worms including human parasites such as hookworm and spiral threadworm.\nTogether these two worms affect up to one billion\npeople worldwide. The research may help identify\npeople who are more vulnerable to infection.\nDr Sumaira Hasnain, the lead experimentalist\non the project, added: \u201cFor the first time, we have\ndiscovered that a single component of the mucus\nbarrier, the Muc5ac mucin, is essential for worm\nexpulsion. Our research may help to identify who\nis and who isn\u2019t susceptible to parasitic worms, and\nit may eventually lead to new treatments for people\nwith chronic worm infections.\u201d\nGut reaction kills worms\nCamilla Ruz\nThese parasitic worms didn\u2019t have the backbone to stand up to the toxic Muc5ac mucin\nSci-fi Column\nThis week I\u2019d like to talk about \u2018Source Code\u2019, a\nscience fiction film released over the Easter break\ndirected by Duncan Jones, who had previously\nworked on the film \u2018Moon\u2019. Though I gave \u2018Moon\u2019\na scathing review my main problem was with the\nscreenplay. That film had a brilliant atmosphere for\nwhich Jones was in a large part responsible, so I\nhad great hopes \u2018Source Code\u2019.\nThe film focuses on Captain Colter Stephens\nwho, after the helicopter he was piloting crashes\nduring a mission in Afghanistan, finds himself\nforced to participate in a secret military program\ncalled Source Code. He is made to repeatedly relieve the last eight minutes in the life of a train passenger so he can discover the identity of the man\nwho planted the bomb that destroyed the train and\nwho is now threatening to attack Chicago. At the\nsame time Stephens, who has no memories of what\nhappened after his crash, tries to figure out why he\nwas recruited for Source Code.\nThis is certainly an interesting premise and initially it is handled very well. Unfortunately it is not\nlong before problems with the film\u2019s pacing appear.\nThe secret of the Source Code becomes quite obvious early on and indeed is explicitly revealed about\nhalfway through, removing one of the main driving\nforces of story. The identity of the bomber itself is\nrevealed some ten minutes before the end of the\nfilm, after which we get an unnecessary and somewhat tedious coda. Some critics have compared\n\u2018Source Code\u2019 favourably to \u2018Inception\u2019. While\nthere are obvious similarities between the two, \u2018Inception\u2019is clearly the superior film. It keeps raising\nthe stakes and never loses the feel of an epic. In\n\u2018Source Code\u2019 though the stakes initially appear to\nbe much higher, the whole of Chicago is threatened\nwith destruction, the film\u2019s atmosphere doesn\u2019t\nsucceed in conveying the appropriate feeling of\nimportance and we seem to lose some tension almost every other scene. \u2018Source Code\u2019also doesn\u2019t\nexplore its premise to the same depth as \u2018Inception\u2019\ndid: even with its poor pacing it feels terribly short.\nI also wasn\u2019t very happy about some of the char-acterisation. Captain Stephens shows a strange reluctance to participate in the Source Code program,\neven when told of the lives in danger. His confusion at suddenly being thrust into the program is\nunderstandable but I would have thought that a\nhighly professional soldier would put aside any\npersonal concerns until the mission was over. It\u2019s\nalso strange that the director of the Source Code\nprogram, Dr. Rutledge, is set up as somewhat of\nan antagonist because Stephens\u2019 welfare isn\u2019t his\nfirst concern. Again, however, with so many lives\nat stake those who oppose him later on in the film\nseem a bit shortsighted.\nThis certainly wasn\u2019t a bad movie and there were\nseveral good scenes. It just could have been a lot\nbetter and it seems to have been overrated in the\npress.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nAnother step towards food security\nResearch could aid global fight against parasitic infections\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n6\nFEATURE\nFeatures Editor: Lizzie Crouch\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 13 May 2011\nFor many, this decision is long over-due. Running a space agency is a very\nexpensive business and hardly sits well\nwith the libertarian zeitgeist which currently pervades the US. According to\nthe Obama administration, we can all\nlook forward to a future where competition between private companies drives\nthe exploration of space relentlessly\nonward. However, for others this vision\nisn\u2019t so rosy. Some fear that the private\ncompanies simply aren\u2019t yet ready to fill\nthe huge void left behind by NASA\u2019s\nshuttle programme, while others are\nideologically opposed and see the shuttle fleet\u2019s retirement as an abandonment\nof our enlightenment principles.\nThe Space Shuttle Endeavour\u2019s final\nflight will see the shuttle crew complete\nfour space walks and deliver a micro-meteoroid debris shield to the International Space Station. The Endeavour\nmission will also deliver a new particle\nphysics module, the brainchild of Nobel laureate Samuel Ting, which is set\nto measure cosmic rays and search for\nevidence of both dark matter and anti-matter. The International Space Station\nis planned to remain in orbit until at\nleast 2020, with astronauts being ferried\nto and from the station exclusively by\nRussian Soyuz spacecraft.\nThe decision to retire the shuttle\nfleet was made back in 2004, in the\nwake of the Columbia Shuttle disaster.\nAt the time this decision was made, it\nwas accompanied by an announcement\nfrom President George W. Bush, outlining plans to send astronauts back to\nthe Moon potentially as early as 2015.\nHowever, these plans have since fallen\nby the wayside.\nUnder Bush, NASA\u2019s Constellation\nprogramme had started development of\na series of rockets, with the potential to\ntake astronauts much further into space\nthan the shuttles are currently capable\nof doing. This development culminated\nin the successful test flight of the Ares-I\nprototype in late 2009. However, only\nthree months later, President Barack\nObama decided to cancel the Constellation programme entirely.\nWhile Obama\u2019s recent budget request\nfor 2012 does include a small amount\nof funding for developing vehicles for\nlong-distance manned spaceflight, its\nreal focus is on developing the commercial space sector. The belief in the US\nseems to be that ferrying astronauts to\nthe International Space Station, as well\nas other low-orbit activities, should be\nleft to private companies, thus leaving\nNASA to concentrate its resources on\nresearch in other areas.\nObama has recently said that the U.S.\nhopes to send astronauts to Mars by\nthe fourth decade of this century. So,\nperhaps NASA\u2019s decision to farm out\nsome of its activities to private companies wouldn\u2019t actually be such bad\nnews , if tangible progress were in fact\nbeing made towards achieving this goal.\nHowever, since the scrapping of the\nConstellation programme, the global financial crisis has really taken hold and\nthere are currently huge question marks\nsurrounding the future of manned space\nexploration, despite the Washington\nrhetoric.\nAlso, as far as low-orbit manned missions are concerned, not everyone is\nconvinced that private companies are\nready to fill the gap left by the shuttle\nfleet\u2019s retirement. There is concern that\nit is a few years too early to be handing\nover responsibility to private companies\nwhile other more outspoken critics, including a number of former NASA as-tronauts, fundamentally disagree with\nthe idea of handing over responsibility\nto private companies at all.\nEarlier this month, NASA celebrated\nthe 50th anniversary of its launching\nof the first American into space. On\n5th May, 1961, Alan Shepard became\nthe second man in space, just less than\na month after Yuri Gagarin\u2019s inaugural\nspaceflight. Upon Shepard\u2019s return to\nEarth, he was asked by a journalist what\nhad been going through his mind as he\nsat atop the Redstone-Mercury rocket\nwhich was to propel him into space.\nShepard reportedly replied: \u201cI was\nthinking about the fact that every part\nof this ship was built by the low bidder\u201d.\nIn many ways, Shepard\u2019s laconic response sums up the fundamental problems with relying on private companies\nfor low-orbit manned space missions.\nMaking a market out of low-orbit spaceflight may result in reduced costs, but\nthis should not be sole the factor taken\ninto consideration. There is also the astronauts\u2019 safety, as well as the safety of\nSPACE AGEING\nANDREW PURCELL WAVES GOODBYE TO THE SPACE\nSHUTTLE AND SAYS HELLO TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR\nA history of the\nspace shuttle\nInstead of the\nshuttle fleet\u2019s\nretirement spelling\nthe end of an era,\nperhaps it can\nbe used to signal\nthe start of a new\nbeginning\n\u201c\nA\nfter being delayed for\nover two weeks, on the\n16th May the Space Shuttle Endeavour is set to\nblast off into space for the\nfinal time.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 13 may 2011 19\nFILM\nI\n\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not the biggest\ncomic book fan. Sure, I used to\nwatch X-Men and Spiderman\ncartoons in my pajamas during\nthe now distant nineties but as\nfar as turning the pages of actual com-ics, my only memories are of the occasional Beano \u2013 if I had enough change\nfrom my pocket money. Many people\ntake the DC and Marvel canons very seriously and the zeal of fans has changed\nthe nature of blockbusters over the past\ndecade. The once action movie staple\nof the Hollywood summer schedule has\nvery quickly been replaced by the now\nfamiliar parade of lycra-cladded super-heroes. If you browse through the major\nfilm websites and magazines , you very\nquickly start to get a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at\nthe bombardment of comic book adaptions that dominate the features and\neventually the cinema screens. Are studios scraping the barrel to find obscure\ncharacters to spin money from? Will\naudiences eventually become bored?\nAnd how many more flops will it take\nfor the comic book phenomenon to implode and make filmmakers realize that\nmaybe the market is oversaturated.\nTo make myself clear I have no prejudice against comic book films in them-selves. It\u2019s easy to come across as a\npretentious snob who only deems that\nhigh brow art-house cinema is worthy\nof our attention and acclaim when having a rant against comic book films. I,\nlike every other person on this planet,\nloved both Christopher Nolan\u2019s Batman films. However, in rebooting the\nBatman franchise, Nolan removed any\nsupernatural elements and silliness and\nin its place dolloped a heavy dose of\nexistentialism. In a similar vein to Coppola\u2019s serious interpretation of the pulp\nnovel The Godfather, Batman Begins\nwas constructed in a realistic manner\nas opposed to the ridiculous Joel Schumacher versions which ruined the franchise (two words: bat nipples). Such is\nthe operatic scope of the recent Batman\nfilms, you look over the fact that Bruce\nWayne dresses up as a bat to fight crime.\nMy problem with comic book films\nis that they all follow the same for-mula. We have our hero, who is typically shown performing an appropriate\nheroic act until an evil villain appears\nto perform some evil deeds. Our hero\neventually defeats the villain but only\nafter nearly being defeated in an epic\nfight. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s popular, it\u2019s bor-ing. Look at the first two Iron Man\nfilms for example. In both films Tony\nStark has to fight a villain with a bigger better version of an Iron Man suit\nand he only wins by sheer luck. In Ang\nLee\u2019s Hulk, Bruce Banner emerges vic-On The Waterfront\nThe Italians dominated social commentary cinema in the fifties and with the\nBritish kitchen sink dramas and French\nNew Wave in their infancies, this gritty\ngenre of cinema was their playground\nuntil the Americans caught up a couple\nof decades later. However, amongst the\ngaudy visuals of Technicolor musicals\nand melodramatic epics of the Golden\nHollywood era, On the Waterfront\nbucked against the trend with a classic\ntale of corruption and working class rebellion against oppression. Elia Kazan\u2019s\nhighly regarded classic was based upon\na series of expos\u00e9 articles about mafia\ncontrolled extortion and racketeering\non the docks of New York. After being\nreluctantly involved in the murder of\ndockworker who is preparing to testify\nagainst the Mob, Terry Malloy (Marlon\nBrando) finds himself questioning his\nconscience about his actions (or lack of)\nas he becomes romantically involved\nwith the dead man\u2019s beautiful sister\n(Eva Marie Saint) who is determined\nto discover the truth about her brother\u2019s\nuntimely death.\nTerry is a gentle man, a failed boxer\nwho took a dive for the Mob and lives\na complacent but unfulfilling life under the protection of his brother, the\ngangsters\u2019 lawyer. Spurred on to question his morals by a crusading priest\n(Karl Malden), Terry decides to break\nthe unspoken code of silence and fight\nfor better treatment of his fellow downtrodden longshoremen. Marlon Brando\nsteals the film in his Oscar-winning\nperformance; every twitch and stare\nalong with his trademark chin scratch\nmasterfully convey all the emotions of\nman reflecting on his own exploitation\nby his Mafioso brother. The scenes between Brando and Marie Saint are especially touching as the specter of her\nbrother\u2019s death hangs over their blossoming relationship. The script is vivid\nand passionate including the immortal \u2018I wish I coulda\u2019 bin a contender!\u2019\nspeech.\nMost importantly On the Waterfront\nwas a turning point in American cinema;\nafterwards the classic dramatic style of\nacting began to wane and the natural\nMethod acting of Brando and Malden\ngradually became the norm. Ed Knock\ntorious over his demented father who\n,guess what, is a bigger better green\nHulk.\nThe four big films this summer are\nThor, X-Men: First Class, Captain\nAmerica, and The Green Lantern. Now\nI can\u2019t pass judgment over Thor as I\nhaven\u2019t seen it but the general vibe I\ngot off reviewers was although it was\nentertaining, they had seen all it before.\nX-Men: First Class has a disappointing\ntrailer; it appears to be a feast of CGI\nwizardry against a thinly constructed\npolitical background. The Green Lantern looks truly awful and I can\u2019t see audiences flocking to see Ryan Reynolds\nplay a galactic policeman who wears a\nmagic ring to fight aliens resembling\nStar Trek rejects.\nCaptain America has a more interesting premise as it\u2019s set during WW2 but\na comic equivalent of The Red Line is\nunlikely. Cyberpunk Nazis may be a\nrefreshing change from armoured automatons but a hero decked in the Stars\nand Stripes looks a little bit ridiculous.\nI guarantee the script will contain some\ndeep mumbo jumbo about the responsibility of power or something similar but\nit\u2019s inevitable that Captain America will\nresult in a manic face off between Hero\nand Villain.\nThe trend for comic book adaptions\ndoes not look like slowing at all, in fact\nit\u2019s accelerating at a scary pace. But although the supply of superhero movies\nwill continue as long as there is a demand for it, there are plenty of people\nin the movie business with big original\nideas and I think it\u2019s time that the major\nstudios stop patronising their audiences\nand give them something new to watch.\nThe success of Inception proves that the\ntried and tested formula of Superhero\nverses Supervillain is not the only recipe for a blockbuster.\nSuperhero overload\nEd Knock laments the rise and rise of the comic book genre\nClassic Cinema\nFilm Editors: Jade Hoffman\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis summer we can \u2018look forward\u2019 to Ryan Reynolds as The Green Lantern (seriously), Anthony Hopkins undoing a\ncareer of great acting, another X-Men film, and the chant \u201cUSA!

It leads to disappointment and raised blood pressure,\nand I get enough of that during\nexam season as it is. I raised an\neyebrow at the NHS reform debate, but\neven that managed to cool down after a\nweek of whining from pressure groups,\nand my eyebrow repositioned itself on\nmy face in its classic, slanted, hateful\nplace, knotted between my eyes.\nBut this week, news reached my eyebrows and other body parts that made\nme sit up and pay marginally more attention that I do normally. The government has a new plan for university\nplaces. It\u2019s the political equivalent of a\ncockslap.\nIt\u2019s almost as if the Tories woke up on\nthe Saturday after the AV referendum\nand realised that the feckless electorate\nand the breathtaking incapability of the\nLiberal Democrats has rendered them\nall but bulletproof until the next elec-tion, and that they can now do basically\nwhatever they want. First on the list: if\nyou\u2019re rich, you can now purchase a\nuniversity place for yourself. Hooray!\nNow let\u2019s see what we can do about this\n\u2018women having the vote\u2019 problem\u2026\nIn fairness, I should really expand\non the policy before I melt down completely into an incomprehensible stream\nof swear words. Currently, university\ntuition fees are going to triple. For some\nreason, the government thought that\nmost universities wouldn\u2019t increase\ntheir fees to the full amount when given\nthe opportunity, thereby repeating the\nclassic mistake of the Sunnyfields Daycare Centre\u2019s Paedophile Rehabilitation\nProgram of 1998. But never mind that.\nIn principle, I believe that education\nshould cost, and the support of loans\nand grants mean that most of people\nwill be able to make it through.\nHowever, now it seems that there\u2019ll be\nanother way in. If you\u2019re willing to pay\neven higher fees \u2013 more than double the\n\u00a39000 barrier for engineering or medical degrees \u2013 then the government may\nbe able to create extra, magical university places for you. The claim is that this\nis to enable charities and businesses to\nsponsor students, and will thereby improve social mobility. The reality is that\nthey\u2019ve always been able to do this by\noffering grants and other support, and\nthat this is really a way to bypass the applications process.\nYou see, although the government\nproposals insist that students will have\nto pass the admission standards, it does\nnot make any claims about interviews,\nor whether they will be measured\nagainst similar applicants. In essence, if\nyou enter university via this route, your\nonly competitors will be the other kids\nsufficiently rich to bargain their way\nin. While the rest of the student body\ncompetes for dwindling places and tries\ntheir hardest to differentiate themselves\nfrom the thousands of other hopefuls,\nthose with money will simply have to\nwalk in with the bare minimum of exam\nresults and take their place.\nIt takes a lot to wake me up from my\ndazed state of margarita-sipping and\nsunbathing around this time of year, but\nthis is beyond unacceptable. The admissions process is already a horrendous\nmess of poor interviewers, muddled pa-Money matters\nperwork and luck. Allowing those with\nmoney to skip the queue so they can fill\nup lecture halls with their soul-sapping\nsense of entitlement while talented students are told to \u2018fuck off and try again\nnext year\u2019 is the absolute epitome of\ndisgusting, indecent politics. It is impossible to justify this; it goes beyond\npetty left and right ideologies \u2013 we are\nfucking with a nation\u2019s education, when\nit should be sacrosanct.\nIt looks like Scotland will have a referendum in a few years to decide whether or not to leave the Union. My advice,\nif any Imperial College students have a\nvote in that referendum, is to implore\neveryone you know to get out while you\nstill can. I don\u2019t understand patriotism at\nthe best of times, but lately the news has\nbeen giving me every reason to actively\navoid it.\nIf you\u2019ve got a safehouse near the\nEnglish border and can help me to\nflee the country, get in touch at\nanangrygeek@gmail.com.\nIf the rich get to pay their way into uni, I\u2019m emigrating\nAngry Geek\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nPoor guy, doesn\u2019t even have enough money for a cockslap...\ny\ny\ne\ne\n-\u201c\n\u201c\nmoney for a cockslap\n\u201d\nWhile the rest of the student\nbody competes, those with\nmoney will simply have to walk\nin with the bare minimum\nBen Kennedy\n\u201cIt\u2019s the political\nequivalent of a\ncockslap\u201d\nA common declaration amongst many people in publishing is that \u2018print is dead\u2019. By\nwhich they mean the idea that the public\nwill continue to read content on paper in\nthe future is laughably ignorant. While the\nprint edition of this cat probably has quite\na few years in it yet, we would be foolish to\ntry and resist the inexorable push and pull\ntowards web-based content.\nSo you may have noticed that Felix\u2019s\nwebsite has been recently redesigned,\nincreasing our potential to finally get serious about online journalism. The design\nis much more user-friendly and there are\nmany more additional features. But now\nthat we\u2019ve reached this point, let\u2019s take a\nlook back at where we started and where\nwe might hope to get to.\nWhen many of Felix\u2019s senior staff began\nat this university, it was impossible to read\nFelix online. This situation continued for two\nyears \u2013 which is not to deride the editors\nat the time, quite simply the infrastructure\ndidn\u2019t exist to deliver the content online. A\nuseable website was constructed last year,\nalong with a complete online archive of (al-most) every issue of Felix. What we have\nseen since then is that our online readership has grown week-on-week as students\nand staff become more accustomed to\nreading the newspaper online.\nSo where do we go from here? Let\u2019s be\nbold. The online edition far surpasses the\nprint edition in every measure except sentimentality and profitability. Felix can access\na far wider audience online and it allows\nus to better understand what topics are\ninteresting to our readers. We are able to\nprovide multi-layered content: video, audio,\nand links to relevant or interesting information on other sites. The reader is able to\ndirectly query the author, and reader discussions can sometimes be as informative as\nthe article that sparks the debate.\nWhich does not mean that there is no argument for the print edition. Profitability is\nno trifling factor; the advertising prices that\na small website like Felix would command\npale in comparison to the print edition. The\nreason for this, indirectly, is sentimentality,\nagain not a factor to be waved aside. The\nprint edition of Felix is an institution. The\nweekly ritual of thousands of Imperial students and staff leafing through the pages of\nthis newspaper is something that connects\nus all. For as long as Felix is financially able\nto do a print version, for this powerful sentimental reason, we would urge future Editors\nto continue to do so.\nBut facts are facts. It is not possible to\nmaintain the print version at its current\nstandard and run a Guardian-esque news\nwebsite \u2013 there are simply not enough\nhours in the day. One day, we hope in the\ndistant future, the students of this university will have to decide which they prefer.\nFELIX\nWhat is the website for?\n\n"

As such it was a somewhat slapdash crew that converged on Clevedon for the University Polo Nationals. Despite what might charitably be described as an exuberant driving style from\none of our players we all made it to the rural side of\nBristol more or less intact, though one of our two\ntrain goers got a bit of a dent to his wallet when he\nrealised that booking his tickets in advance would\nhave been four times cheaper.\nWith, as it turned out, neither of our teams set to\nplay until Friday morning all of us set about making the most of our free time. All, that is, except\nJon \u2018there\u2019s a snake in ma boots\u2019 Matthews who\nhad managed to get himself a job doing what he\nloves best\u2026 shouting at people. The rest of us\nwere more interested in booze, polo and the rapidly\ngrowing number of people planning on coming to\ndinner with us.\nAs play continued into the night (not set to finish till about 10pm!) we eventually managed to\nbundle everyone in the car and high tail it back to\nthe hotel for dinner. There, I suspect, the hotel staff\nweren\u2019t best pleased to see a group of close to fifty\nhungry students swarm shortly before shifts were\nsupposed to end and the kitchen was supposed to\nclose. It\u2019s not often you get that many students\nfrom half a dozen different universities congregating and socialising round a table and we were all\npretty impressed that Thijs had managed to get so\nmany people there. Actually he was developing\nsomething of a rep by then though dubbing him\n\u2018the Dutch Sleaze\u2019 was probably a bit harsh, still\nit was definitely not the worst nickname coined for\nthe first time that weekend.\nEveryone, well everyone from Imperial, was\npretty sedate that night, probably due to the Novices having their first two matches at 9 and 10 the\nfollowing morning against Reading and then Exeter. The Reading game came and went in a bit of\na blur, horses the guys were meeting for the first\ntime were something of a worry and we were pretty\nlucky that two out of three really got on well with\ntheir allotted mounts. In any equestrian sport the\nhorse beneath you is just as important as the rider\non top and the lack of a good partnership unfortunately made for a frustrating game for Henry unable to quite make his presence felt on the pitch.\nHowever, a lot of positives came out of that match,\nnot least the fact that the guys managed to get a\nvictory and Sverr\u00e9 and Huey really showed how\nyou can step up your game when the pressure is on.\nWith a change of horse for his second chukka we\n...Continued on Page 30\nMen\u2019s Lacrosse\nnarrowly miss out\non first silverware\nBUCS Lacrosse Trophy Final\nImperial 10 - 12 Leeds Met\nDavid Thompson\nFollowing a hard fought victory over Swansea\nin the semis, Imperial Men\u2019s Lacrosse faced up\nagainst Leeds Met Carnegie in the BUCS Trophy\nfinal in Sheffield on the 17th March.

However, in the\ntwo years since that crushing defeat the team has\nimproved vastly and confidence was high on the\nlong trip up North.\nThe pre-match talk was focused on avoiding penalties as there were to be four officials rather than\nthe usual one but this did not stop Imperial giving\naway a number of soft early penalties.

Here we were able\nto see the Santiagans relaxing and socialising\nin typical South American fashion \u2013 as always,\nevery day and night is a party.\nAvoiding two wild horses careering through\nthe park we went to relax beside the stream.\nThere were numerous Chilean families parked\nup beside it with barbeques and cooler boxes,\nblasting English rock music. Apparently this\nafternoon piss-up was an after-party of a wedding the night before. As is customary, every\nperson we met greeted us with an affectionate\nkiss on the cheek and a handshake.\nWe also wandered through the quiet streets\nof Bellavista, home of the late Chilean poet\nNeruda. Despite not appearing on any Chillian\nbanknotes on account of his radical communist\nviews, he is on posters and pictures all over\ntional figurehead Arturo Prat. He was a naval\nofficer who died rather than let his Chilean\nship surrender to its enemies and now is lauded\neverywhere as the inspiration for such phrases\nas \u201cnever give up\u201d. His statue stands proud in\nValparaiso\u2019s grandest plaza.\nOur last day was spent in the sprawling metropolitan city centre of Santiago. As you move\nout from the skyscrapers and rows of little\nhouses, you eventually reach hills with the\nmost incredible views. The heart of the city is\nin the Plaza D\u00b4Armis, modern glass buildings\nreflecting the archaic imposing monuments\nand luscious old buildings (even if one does\njust house a rather peculiar event of a table tennis competition for elderly men).\nYou are constantly surrounded by noise and\npeople, whether it be nut sellers, dried wheat\nand peach juice vendors, or protestors being\nscrambled into police vans. The men in our\ngroup yearned to be taken to the infamous \u2018coffee with legs\u2019 caf\u00e9s, where customers are treated to coffee served by beautiful women bearing\nendlessly long legs. In some Santiagan versions\nof this shop, the managers pick a \u2018happy minute\u2019where music blasts, shutters roll down, and\nwaitresses climb onto tables and strip for the\npatrons. Then the minute ends, the shutters roll\nup and business continues as usual.\nRather than joining the crowd at the \u2018caf\u00e9\nwith legs,\u2019 we joined the crowds outside the\ngrand palace of the President, where schoolchildren running amok were singing and\nchanting \u201cChi Chi Chi-le!\u201d, as TV cameras\ntried to capture the image. In the centre of all\nthis was a large white capsule with the Chilean\nflag upon it. The red stands for the blood of the\npeople, blue for the clear (ish \u2013 Santiago has a\nlot of smog) skies, white for the snow-peaked\nmountains of the Andes, and the star for the\nhearts of the Chilean people.\nAt that moment, the hearts of the Chilean\npeople were singing with joy for the release\nof the miners and the crowds were baying for\nsight of these heroes. The white capsule outside the presidential palace was the very one\nwhich had released the miners from the darkness down below the earth to the light of the\nSantiagan sun, and we were honoured to be\nable to see it.\nThe main lesson learnt here was to \u2018do it the\nChilean way\u2019. Do what you believe in with all\nof your might and all of your heart, just like\nArturo Prat. Do it like a prat.\nPriya Garg\nSee, there\u2019s always a party.

Bohemian heaven is just a stone\u2019s throw\nthrough some windy passageways. An unstable\nwooden elevator took us up to a cobbled street\nwith brightly painted tin houses and carved balconies overlooking the beach and the sea.

    "content": "FELIX\n14\nThe Review\nA R T S\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 13 MAY 2011\nWhen a cast is given the name of the musical they\nwill perform 24 hours before curtain-up, no-one\nshould expect anything particularly special. When\nthat cast is from the glorious Musical Theatre Society, the tables are turned. This rendition of \u2018We Will\nRock You\u2019 was absolutely phenomenal. With a cast\nof 22, plus technical crew, choreographer, director,\nmusical director, and a band, they kept the Union\nConcert Hall enthralled for nearly three hours.\n\u2018We Will Rock You\u2019 is a strange musical, and not\none that I really believed everyone could appreciate.\nIt\u2019s a showcase of the music of Queen, held together\nby a storyline which was created to do just that. Unfortunately, even seen amongst the plots of its fellow musicals, this one for me is pretty tenuous, it\u2019s\nall part of the fun but I\u2019ve never thought there was\nsomething that could make you forget its artificiality.\nIt turns out there is something that can make you\nforget though. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because they hadn\u2019t\nslept, but the raw energy of the cast kept the show\nmoving like a bullet-train. A huge number of Queen\u2019s\nsongs are showstoppers, think \u2018Killer Queen\u2019, \u2018Another One Bites the Dust\u2019, \u2018Don\u2019t Stop Me Now\u2019, \u2018We\nWill Rock You\u2019, \u2018We are the Champions\u2019\u2026 etc. etc.\netc.) but this show didn\u2019t stop. With each song more\nvisceral than the last, the audience\u2019s Sunday-night\nlethargy was blasted out of them by the lungs and\nmuscles of people who should have been recovering\nfrom inhuman exhaustion.\nBeing pushed to their physical limits didn\u2019t stop\nthe cast from keeping control of their highly choreographed movement and singing. There were some\nlines which hadn\u2019t been learnt and it is to their credit\nthat they managed not to break the illusion whilst\nprompting themselves with notes written on just\nabout every prop they had. Some cast carried off\nthese manoeuvres with musical hall aplomb while a\ncouple were self-consciously happy to point out their\nfailings. Although apparently at odds with the gusto\nof the genre, it worked to keep everyone laughing.\nOn a weekend when most of us were lamely pushing ahead with the revision schedule, these students\ncreated something spectacular. From a society that\nhas proven time and again just what dedication and\nrehearsal can do for a performance came a showcase of the part that pure talent and energy play as\nwell. It was genuinely brilliant regardless of the time\ntaken to put on. If this exercise is repeated, I advise\nyou not to miss out. Rox Middleton\nCast List\nGalileo Robert Felstead\nScaramouche Katie Clemence\nKiller Queen Shamini Bundell\nPop Sebastian Junemann\nKhashoggi Al Norman\nMeat Rebecca Jones\nBrit Phil Raymond\nEnsemble: Charlotte Ivison, Sanee Patel, Owain\nJones, Christine Simpson, Oluwatosin Ajayi, Sophie\nCampen, Lucy Harrold, Michael Willmott, Barry Whiteside, Felix Millne, Holly Russell-Allison, John Wheatley,\nPhilip Jackson, Tony Bannister, Yun William Yu.\nDirector: David Swain\nMusical Director: Zoe Humphries\nChoreographer: James Perry\n1\n9:25 The triumvirate at the\nhead of this incredible undertaking have just announced\nthe name of the show. David\nSwain nonchalantly goes over\nto his laptop to press play on what he\ncalls: \u201cOne of the most famous numbers\nof the show, and indeed of all time\u201d. Silence falls among the cast as the opening notes of Queen\u2019s \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019fill the hall. Cheers are heard from\nsome, silence from others, as they realise this means they will be performing\nBen Elton\u2019s musical of Queen songs:\n\u2018We Will Rock You\u2019.\n21:10 Seb Junemann, a society veteran and director of this summer\u2019s production of Guys and Dolls, pointed out to\nme earlier that \u2018We Will Rock You\u2019was\na surprising but great choice for a\nproject like this. Not only would most\npeople know the music, he claimed, but\nthe naturally chaotic, Bohemian show\ncould only benefit from the exuberant\ndisorganisation this 24-hour musical\nwas certain to display. Those optimistic\nwords came at 19:40 \u2013 before the first\nmusical sing-through and well before\nthe first dance rehearsal.\n22:05 Slices of Red Leicester on\nCream Crackers are an ideal substitute\nfor dinner. Hey-ho: off to look for a\ncopy of Ben Elton\u2019s script.\n00:15 So, we\u2019re a sixth of the way\nthrough this ordeal, and I think the onset\nof the late-night-high can be felt. Morale is high and appetites are low after\na midnight gorging on Domino\u2019s Pizza\nand Lucy Harrold\u2019s jelly.\nThe cast are now attempting their first\nrun of \u2018Radio GaGa\u2019 on the Concert\nHall stage, and the amount of wiggling\ngoing on in the cast\u2019s hips is causing the\njelly to turn green with envy. Or maybe\nthat\u2019s the food colouring. Director David Swain has returned to his hiding\nplace upstairs, consoling himself with\nvisions of a 4am power nap. And his\nhalf of a meat feast pizza.\n00:36 I still haven\u2019t seen a copy of\nthis blasted script. There are about\nthree copies of same making the rounds\namong 24 cast members, so I rank pretty\nlow on the guest list.\nSitting next to the window, looking\nout at the stars above the Royal Albert\nHall (too late for stars in the Royal Albert Hall, I\u2019m afraid), this seems like\nan opportune time to mention Queen\u2019s\nspecific relevance to the Imperial com-munity. The guitarist Brian May, almost\nuniversally considered to be among the\nbest living exponents of that instrument,\nis an Imperial alumnus. Since graduating in 2007, Brian May CBE has received a disproportionate amount of\ncoverage from Imperial\u2019s Communications Centre as one of the university\u2019s\nfew presentable graduates. Call me bit-ter, but I hardly think that David Irving\nwould make as good a poster child. And\nthe plot of his rock musical is, quite\nfrankly, just plain silly.\n11:36 Having listened to more Queen\nin the past 14 hours than in the rest of\nmy life combined, it strikes me that\nthere is something powerfully earthy\nin what I\u2019ve heard so far. Music of a\nbreathtakingly epic quality which explicitly names objects, fears and desires\nthat ordinary human beings would en-counter. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making\nmyself as clear on this point as I would\nlike \u2013 let me get back to you once my\nphilosophy of rock has some more time\nto develop.\n12:00 The technical crew have now\narrived, in the persons of James Gallagher and the suicidally competent Francis Clegg. Lights are going up, keys\nare being rattled and ladders are being\nmoved around at frightening velocities.\nHaving been involved with a number of\ntechnical set-ups over the past few years\nat Imperial, these are all good signs.\n15:15 I\u2019m realising that I haven\u2019t\ngiven enough credit to the amount of\npreparatory work this operation must\nhave involved. The choice of show was\nmade less than three weeks ago, and the\nsecrecy surrounding it must have made\nany planning well-nigh impossible.\nAnd yet, at 19:30 last night, copies of\nthe score and script (though admittedly\nnot enough!) were printed and ready for\ndistribution, a detailed rehearsal schedule was taped to the wall, and James\nPerry arrived with enough energy coursing through him to electrocute a meadow full of Duracell bunnies.\nSo far, at least, this preparation has\npaid off in an astonishing way.\n17:01 One aspect of this performance\nwhich is brought into sharp focus by the\nshort rehearsal period allotted it is the\nraw vocal power possessed by so many\nof its cast. When Katie Clemence sings\n\u2018Somebody to Love\u2019 over the hall\u2019s\nspeakers, the walls seem to bend under\nthe force of her voice. The awkwardness which the cast must feel they are\ndisplaying comes across as beautifully\nedgy realism. Which, I need scarcely\npoint out, suits the music of Queen to\na T.\n\u201cSure, it\u2019s a little loose around\nthe edges, but not significantly\nmore than most other dress\nrehearsals I\u2019ve been involved\nwith. Awesome. Just awesome\u201d\nWE WILL\nROCK YOU\nPhotos by Simon Worthington\nRead the full\nliveblog at\nfelixonline.co.uk\n\n"

However, although the\nteam did manage to play better in the second\nchukka, Exeter were an extremely strong team\n(actually they narrowly missed out in the final)\nand were just too much for the lads. Still, all in\nall a 50% record wasn\u2019t a bad first day for the\nnovices and after a long wait while the novices got a headstart on the beer the Lower Intermediate team had their first match, sending\nNottingham packing with a sound 5-1 thrash-ing; Thijs putting away one lovely shot under\nhis ponies neck and two text book taps along\nthe wall while Alex got two lucky shots from\nrange, one from around the halfway line. Jon\ncame out with a duck but had been playing a\ngreat game linking up with both other players\nand interfering with the opposition\u2019s offensive.\nPretty happy with ourselves those of us that\nweren\u2019t getting our shouting fix or (in Huey\nthe Hedgehog\u2019s case) hibernating headed to\nthe pub for another night of socialising. Again,\na huge crowd managed to congregate at a local\npub (with proper West Country cider) for a few\npints and it wasn\u2019t long until we\u2019d blagged ourselves an invite down to have dinner with the\nExeter lot who turned out to be quite an amiable bunch after beating us. I\u2019m not sure any\nof us realised that we would be heading basically all the way to Exeter for the meal but free\nsausage and mash is free sausage and mash so\nnone of us were complaining. Well, not until\nHenry got sucked into a game of fives and ended up having to down two glasses of wine in a\nrow. The usually quite sensible Henry earned\nthe title of \u2018English Drunkard\u2019 that evening,\nwhich was further reinforced by his unsuccessful attempt to jump into bed upon our eventual\nreturn to the hotel. Unfortunately his double\nvision meant he jumped at the wrong bed and\ngot some pretty impressive carpet burn the following morning. As it turns out, polo is a dangerous sport.\nWith another early start and rumours of a\ntactical chunder by one of the Novices that\nmorning I don\u2019t think anyone was in quite the\nright frame of mind for their chukka against\nNottingham and the girls in green took full\nadvantage of our slight greenness around the\ngills hitting home a bit of revenge after their\nlower intermediate teams trouncing. Our Lower Intermediate team, with somewhat longer\nto recover, were well up for our traditional\ngrudge match against ULU that afternoon and\nthe relatively amicable relationship we\u2019d had\nwith them on Thursday night was put on hold\nuntil the end of our chukka. This was one of the\nclosest matches I\u2019ve played and we were perhaps a little lucky to squeeze out a 2-1 lead after a couple of fouls were committed against us\nand then hold it under a lot of pressure until the\nbuzzer went leaving us progressing to the two\nchukka final against our new friends Exeter.\nWith an old friend arriving that day to play\nin the alumni tournament we had a pretty decent crowd when it came to the party that eve-ning. All of us gathered in one hotel room for\ndrinks and dinner before heading away, with\nHuey (presumably stocking up for winter)\nmanaging to have dinner once before leaving\nthe polo ground and then a huge lamb shank in\nour room as well! The party is always amusing and with several hundred students there the\nbouncy castle generally doesn\u2019t manage to last\nthat long, however the inflatable assault course\nand bungee run provided much amusement\nand the beat-boxing, acoustic trio on stage\nwere surprisingly good for an event organised\nby a club.\nSunday saw the Novices first up once again\nwith a battle to regain some pride on their hands\nand to win their last chukka. A final change of\nhorse left Henry with one last chance to find\nhis perfect steed, though with Sverr\u00e9 claiming he thought he was going to vom off the\nside of his mount I have to say I wasn\u2019t confident the guys would play at their best. Still,\nI was very glad to be proved wrong and the\nteam played the best polo I\u2019ve ever seen from\nthem. Henry finally found his confidence and,\nwithout speeding up a great deal, was finally\nable to stop worrying about the beast between\nhis legs (*snigger*) and start concentrating on\nthe playing the ball (*snigger more*), getting\nseveral impressive runs down the wall. Huey\nagain played the most physical game I\u2019ve ever\nseen from the normally quiet player and Sverr\u00e9\nmanaged to overcome his nausea to cover the\ngaps between the two players both in attack\nand defence. Overall they dominated the girls\nfrom Harper Adams and came away with a\ngood victory to top off their weekend.\nThen it was down to the Lower Intermediate\nteam. Could we pull of the biggest victory ICU\nRiding and Polo have seen to date or would\nExeter continue to storm ahead to victory as\nthey had done in the previous rounds. Things\ndidn\u2019t look good in the first few minutes as Exeter got off to an early lead while we took a\nwhile to really get motoring. Their best player,\nFrancois, really seemed to have us pegged at\nthe beginning but we managed to claw our way\nback into things toward the end of the first half.\nWith only a short break before the second we\nstayed on or close to our horses and chatted\nabout how to try to counter their play realising that we needed to be better at maintaining\npossession and being quicker on the turn both\nin support of each other and to get the defensive plays working better. In the second half\nwe really hung in there, never really managing to get ahead but not falling further behind\neither. A few fouls not spotted by the umpire\nmight have helped us close the gap but when\nthe buzzer went we couldn\u2019t be disappointed\nat losing to such a strong team and, despite being about ready to collapse we were the first to\ncongratulate Exeter on a tournament well won\nwith a loud call for three cheers.\nAll in all this February was the best tournament I\u2019ve been to yet and we were all happy\nto bring home a little glassware for Riding and\nPolo. Even if it did say \u2018Runners Up\u2019 on it.\nICU Riding and Polo heads\nto the Arena Polo Nationals\n...

The student was not\nwilling to speak to Felix about his situation as he is currently applying for an\nextension to his PhD. Several research\ngroups have been hamstrung by the de-lays, mostly from the uncertainty over\nthe completion date and from difficulties in providing temporary facilities for\nresearch. Currently around 12 PhD students in the thermal fluids division have\nto share a lab where only one student at\na time can carry out their combustion\nexperiments, due to insufficient ventila-tion.\nThe refurbishment of the Mechanical Engineering building began as part\nof a wider \u00a3277m South-East Quadrant\n(SEQ) project that envisaged a new\nmodern building that would bring Mechanical, Aeronautical, and Civil Engineering together under one roof where\nthe Mechanical Engineering building\ncurrently sits. It was first mooted in\n2007 and included plans for a Business\nKadhim Shubber School-esque fa\u00e7ade facing onto Exhibition Road. The project, which it was\nsaid would \u2018make a statement about Engineering at Imperial\u2019, was eventually\nshelved at the beginning of 2010 when\nWestminster Council rejected the College\u2019s planning application, demanding\nchanges to the design, and the College\ndecided that the funds required to complete the project would be difficult to\nraise after the recession.\nHowever, Phase One of the proj-ect, involving the refurbishment of\nthe Skempton Building as well as the\nongoing Mech Eng refurbishment had\nalready received planning permission\nand funding from the College and both\nwere well underway. Reports from Imperial\u2019s former Chief Operating Officer\nDr Martin Knight seemed to indicate\nthat the refurbishment was continuing\nsmoothly until May 2010, when he reported to College Council that the Mech\nEng refurbishment was \u201cnow under the\nmanagement of a different Arup project\nmanager [...] and is under tight control\u201d. The minutes record that he also\nsaid \u201cAn interim agreement has been\ndrawn up to settle all current claims\nand variations\u201d. The statements suggest\nthat problems with the refurbishment\nwere encountered as far back as spring\nlast year and that the College were\nunhappy with Arup\u2019s performance as\nproject manager.

Endless resistance (3)\nto capitalise on their early man-up plays\nbut took the lead as Imperial were slow\nto start. The reply was quick in coming however and the inevitable nerves\nseemed to settle afterwards. The first\nquarter was fairly even and the teams\nreached the end of the first quarter level.\nThe start of the second quarter saw a\nmultitude of penalties from both sides\nbut unfortunately more from Imperial.\nThis resulted in Leeds dominating possession for the remainder of the quarter\nand they scored a number of goals in\nquick succession. Imperial were struggling to regain the ball and went into\nhalf time significantly behind.\nFollowing the ten minute break Imperial came back out fighting, forcing\nLeeds into making mistakes and this\nquarter it was to be them who spent\nmore time in the penalty box. Imperial managed to get some goals back\nthrough Captain Jeremy Webb and the\nformidable crease man Tomas Bym\nwho would eventually finish top scorer.\nLeeds were not helping themselves by\narguing with each other and the refer-ees, and even though Imperial\u2019s defence\nwas down to just four men at one point\nthey held strong and went into the last\nquarter just one goal behind.\nAfter the restart both teams were\nclearly tiring resulting in sloppy mistakes and the play became end-to-end.\nThe teams were alternating scoring until\nImperial\u2019s Ian Hunt scored three beautiful goals; one brushing the post and\nbar on its way into the top corner. This\ngave Imperial the lead going into the final five minutes but when they should\nhave held possession they pushed for\nthe killer goal which resulted in a turnover of possession to Leeds who levelled the game again. Imperial pushed\nfor the winner in the dying minutes but\na number of dropped passes let Leeds\nscore their 11th and 12th goals and time\neventually ran out for Imperial with the\nmatch finishing 12-10 to Leeds.\nIt was Imperial\u2019s best performance\nagainst the strongest opposition they\nhad faced in the three short years the\nMen\u2019s team has existed, but it was\nLeeds\u2019 ability to hold the ball when a\nman down and their efficiency in converting when a man up that was the difference between the sides in the end.\nAlthough disappointed in letting the\ngame slip away at the end, Imperial\nshould look back and be proud at what\nthey have achieved in such a short time,\nand think about how far they have come\nsince the 20-0 defeat to Birmingham in\ntheir first season.\n... Continued from back page\nLacrosse\nbested by\nLeeds in\nfinal\nOn Friday the 18th of March Imperial\nCollege judo sent their elite squad of\nJudoka to fight in the British University\nChampionships. On the journey up to\nSheffield there were many hungry and\nthirsty players in the minibus, hoping\nto make their weight for the upcoming\nweekend. Thankfully, everyone made it\nand could relax after a long slog up the\ncountry and a rather large meal.\nThe tournament kicked on Saturday\nwith the Individual\u2019s Event, Imperial\nentered 4 Dan grades (black and brown\nbelts) and six Kyu grades (green and\nblue belts). Despite the stiff competi-tion, Tomasz Zamacinski (Kyu -81kg)\nfought incredibly well to bring home\na gold medal winning a total of six\nfights. Alice Mitchell (Kyu -57kg) and\nJake Woods (Kyu -66kg) also did well\nin their categories both earning Bronze\nmedals. In the Kyu grades, missing out\non the medals, were Adam Elwood,\nJames Gutsell (both -81kg) and Phillip\nRudden (-66kg). The Dan grades had an\neven tougher day but Marie de Parseval\n(-63kg) pulled out all the stops and beat\noff some of the country\u2019s best female\nfighters to achieve a bronze medal. Matthew Scales (-66kg), Bronwyn Dawson\n(-57kg) and Eduoard Desclaux (-73kg)\nall fought courageously but missed out\non medals in the huge Dan grade pools.\nTestaments to the quality of university\njudo were several international competitors in the Dan grade categories. Ed lost\nout on the Bronze medal to a Latvian international after winning five of his six\nprevious fights.\nThe following day the team competitions ensued. Karl Brune (-90kg)\nand Silv\u00e8re Lucquin (-73kg) joined\nthe men\u2019s team along with Ed, Matt\nand Tom. The team fought well in the\npool, comfortably beating Manchester,\nNottingham and Strathclyde and only\nlosing to the gold medal winning Anglia Ruskin. Unluckily, we were draw\nagainst Plymouth, eventual bronze med-allists, in the first knockout round and\nlost a close set of fights. Imperial were\nboosted later, however, with the success\nof the women\u2019s team. Alice, Bronwyn\nand Marie convincingly beat Cambridge\nand Glasgow to secure a Bronze medal.\nThis was an excellent performance considering Bronwyn\u2019s shoulder injury and\nthe other teams mainly consisting of\nDan grades. They were unfortunately\nbeaten at the semi final by some big ladies from Bath.\nThroughout the weekend we had great\nsupport and guidance from the club\ncoach Smudge and a big Irish fellow,\nDerek. With their guidance from the\nsidelines the great performances were\nmade possible. A special congratulation is in order to Jake for winning his\nbet, forcing Smudge to wear the Sport\nImperial Lion costume throughout Sunday. The weekend was topped off with a\nrelaxed regional competition, where we\nbanded together with Judoka from ULU\nand Middlesex as the London Team. We\nbeat the North and South West, only losing out to Scotland to achieve a silver\nmedal.\nAfter much revelry and eating the\nJudo squad headed back to London battered and bruised but with pride intact.\nA great effort was made by everyone\nwho fought and some great results, despite the team being plagued with in-jury. Imperial Judo is looking strong as\never, training starts now for BUCS next\nyear!\nBUCS success for\nImperial Judo yet\nagain\nAdam Elwood\nThe official unveiling of the refurbished\nEnergia Gym run by Sport Imperial, located St Mary\u2019s hospital took place on\nWednesday 6th April.\nThe gym, which had been run by St\nMary\u2019s hospital, was closed for a short\nperiod of time during which it underwent redecoration and refurbishment\ntogether with the introduction of new\nequipment.\nAs well as improved gym equipment\nmembers of the gym will now be eligible to use the swimming pool in the Imperial Medical School, located opposite\nthe gym.\nThe gym is located in the basement\nof the Cambridge Building at St Mary\u2019s\nhospital.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 13 may 2011 21\nGAMES\nI guess \u2013 Laurence Pope Never! \u2013 Omar Hafeez-Bore\nWith games now enjoying their official status as\nart, whilst worming their way onto every device we\nown, Felix asks:\nT\nhis was always going to be a difficult\npiece to write, since the answer to the\nabove question could be summed up\nsuccinctly in a single syllable \u2013 yes.\nUnfortunately, my editor isn\u2019t particularly happy with one word articles, so I suppose\nI\u2019d better make something out of this question.\nApparently I\u2019m going head-to-head with Omar on\nthis issue, but because I\u2019m a good sport I\u2019m going\nto avoid digging up dirt to discredit his argument,\nirreversibly wreck his reputation, and shame his\nfamily for generations to come.\nThe first thing I\u2019d have to ask is what people consider a \u2018non-waste\u2019 of time. If it is something that\nis considered fun, then one can hardly label video\ngames as wastes of such time \u2013 unless you\u2019re the\nkind of weirdo who plays them to increase their\nsense of crushing boredom, o\u2019course. After all, in\nthe words of Bertrand Russell: \u201cThe time you enjoy\nwasting is not wasted time.\u201d If something is enjoy-able, it can hardly be said to be wasteful (whether\nit is moral or not is another question entirely, and\nnot entirely relevant to the matter at hand). If old\nBerty agrees with me on this issue, who are you to\ndare argue back?\nIf something has to be productive to be a non-time waster, then one has to ask themselves what\nISN\u2019T a pointless time sink. Films come instantly\nto mind \u2013 last time I checked, movie-goers didn\u2019t\nquite get the same flak for seeing films as gamers\ndo playing video games. There is a line of thought\nthat says films can educate and games cannot, and I\nhate it every bloody time someone opens their gob\nto spout it out.\nHowever corny it may sound, many modern\ngames have storylines and plots comparable to\nthat of a movie, the difference being you don\u2019t\nnormally sit through a movie with a mouse/con-troller in your hand. Hell, only recently the US\nNational Endowment for the Arts declared video\ngames, among other associated media, \u2018officiallysanctioned art forms\u2019. To proclaim video games a\nwaste of time is to do the same to films and every\nother form of traditional art, and also brings into\nquestion why one activity should be better than\nanother. Yes, this is imperfect logic, shut up. I\u2019m\na video gamer, not a logician with a PhD in being\nsmart.\nLook folks, let\u2019s face the facts here. You can cut\nup the argument however you want, but at the end\nof the day, games do suck up time \u2013 anyone who\u2019s\nplayed World of Warcraft can testify to this (just\nask down at Blackett Labs). They are specifically\ndesigned to draw you in and a game that does, one\nthat is capable of sapping away hours from your\nlife, is considered successful. But that\u2019s no reason\nto feel guilty about playing them, and I\u2019m not just\nsaying that so you\u2019ll continue to read the Games\npage.\nHaving fun in life is important, and if you draw\npleasure from video gaming then more power to\nyou. Yes, I consider them wastes of time at the end\nof the day, but you should feel no guiltier indulging in them than a person who watches films, reads\nfiction or listens Justin Bieber.\nActually, scratch that last one.\nW\ne\u2019d need a whole year of Felix to crack this issue. At least.\nEven then, after discussing the\nimportance of play and whether we actually deserve to have\nso much entertainment at our fingertips, we\u2019d still\ncome up short. This is Big Philosophy; a discussion of how Man Should Spend His Time, no less.\nYes, time. The very currency of our lives and\nwe choose to spend it playing games? And then\nhave the nerve to celebrate how much of this precious currency games cost us? \u2018It\u2019s very addictive!\u2019\nThat\u2019s it! The jackpot. The bullseye. The highest\naccolade a game can get. But why?\nIf people reviewed sweets \u2013 and if they did, I\u2019d\ngive the mega-sour balls from Mr Simm\u2019s sweet\nshop 5/5 \u2013 \u2018addictive\u2019would be the last thing people\nwould praise about them. The Daily Mail headlines\nwould write themselves: \u2018Kids go crazy for crack\ncandy\u2019, \u2018Lollipop lady lamped by lolly-loving Lolita\u2019, \u2018Immigrants stole my sherbert!\u2019 et cetera.\nBecause too much of anything is bad for you.\nThink of the best thing for you in the world. Water,\nright? Well, even that is bad for you if you drink\ntoo much! No joke. I checked. And unless you\u2019re\nreally crap at, you know, basic actions of human\ninstinct, drinking water takes up way less time to\ndrink than games do to play.\nSo let\u2019s make one big fat assumption right now.\nLet\u2019s assume we are not good-for-nothing students\nwho feel that spending a few hours each day in lectures listening (puff, pant) is strenuous enough an\nactivity to justify frittering our free time on hard-earned-cotching. On streaming endless movies,\nwatching 24 box-sets in real time or playing COD\nuntil we are the leanest, meanest button-presser-to-ever-press-a-button-to-pretend-to-kill-a-complete-ly-digital-person-on-screen.\nLet\u2019s instead pretend that we are balanced individuals who work, play sport, contribute to the\ncommunity and help old ladies and the occasional\nchicken across the road. Individuals who have\nsatisfied their Good Human quota and have a few\nhours a week to spend on a hobby. Even in that\n(improbable) case, would games be a good use of\ntime, when we could watch a film, or read a book,\nor tinker with model trains or something?\nThe smart readers will have already spotted the\nfundamental flaw in the previous sentence: that it\nwas retarded. You know that feeling you get when\nyou really fancy watching a horror film, but then\ndecide that you\u2019ll just read Bridget Jones instead?\nNo, nor me.\nGames are great because they are as different to\nfilm as books are. As playing guitar is to collecting\nstamps. They are games, and only they can satisfy\nthat itch for a headshot or a pixel-perfect jump. No,\nthey are not some geek\u2019s substitute for real life. No\none sticks on FIFA when they fancy a game of footy\nin the park. They play FIFA when they fancy pressing some buttons and waggling a couple of sticks\nuntil a screen pronounces them better at doing it\nthan their mate. They stick FIFA on when they fancy\na game of FIFA. And if I fancy exploring a hazy,\nsun-dappled world of surrealist melancholy I\u2019ll play\nIco and not just admire a De Chirico painting.\nShould people try to balance their life so they\ndon\u2019t spend massive chunks of it in front of a\nscreen? Should they ensure they don\u2019t sacrifice\nsocial contact, going out, keeping healthy, working hard and all that in the name of raising digital\ndigits in a digital world? Yes, probably.\nBut can people really dismiss a whole medium\nas a waste of time any more than another? I agree\nwith Laurence on one point: maybe people should\nfeel guilty about spending too much time on pure\nsedentary entertainment, on the pursuit of its own\npleasure. But not specifically games. They\u2019ve\ntaught me as much as other, \u2018worthier\u2019 art forms,\nand given me plenty of things the others never\ncould.\nARE VIDEO GAMES\nA WASTE OF TIME?\n\u201c[But] last time I checked,\nmovie-goers didn\u2019t quite\nget the same flak for\nseeing films as gamers do\nplaying video games\u201d\nHave your say on this article\non felixonline.co.uk\nSimon Worthington\n\n"

They incited a bit of a riot at\nthe Camden Crawl, where they outshined every other\nband present, and have an established and dedicated fanbase that just keeps on growing. Goblin marks\na clear musical progression for the leader of the Wolf\nGang, as he pushes his Neptunes-influenced mini-malistic indie hip-hop to brave weird worlds. Tracks\nlike \u2018Yonkers\u2019 and \u2018Troncat\u2019 retain the same visceral\nanger and insanity that fans know and love, but it is\non the heavily R&B-tinged \u2018She\u2019, the manic and funky\n\u2018Transylvania\u2019 (produced by Left Brain), and in the\nstrange beauty of \u2018Analog\u2019, that Tyler really outdoes\nhimself. On this album more than ever before Tyler\nseparates the different sides of his musical persona\n(Wolf Haley, Ace Creator and Troncat) onto distinct\ntracks, resulting in what could be considered a concept album: Tyler discovers the pitfalls of becoming\nan instant celebrity, questions his abilities, falls prey\nto his weaknesses and ends up shooting every member of the Golf Wang (metaphorically?) before finally\ndiscovering himself. Bring on Wolf. Greg Power\nMost\nlistened to\nthis week by\nFelix Music\nmembers\non last.fm\nMake sure not to miss\nStag and Dagger\nSeveral venues in Shoreditch\nThursday, 19th May 2011\nStag and Dagger is an annual festival of new music\nwhich takes place in and around Old Street in East\nLondon. It promises to be an amazing night with\nact such as D/R/U/G/S, James Yuill, New Young\nPony Club, Star Slinger, Toro Y Moi, Wire and many\nmore. Buy your ticket online, then head to XOYO after 6pm to exchange it for a wristband which grants\nyou access to all participating venues for the entire\nnight. The principal venues are CAMP Basement,\nThe Macbeth, Hoxton Bar & Kitchen and 93 Feet\nEast, amongst others. The nearest tube stations\nare Aldgate East and Old Street.

LCD Soundsystem\nwww.staganddagger.com\nA\nbove The Relentless Garage\nin Islington lies a small hall\nsignposted from the outside as\n\u201cUpstairs\u201d. The quirky mystery\nof this sign gives every hint of\nwhat lies beyond, namely a small 150-capacity\nhall with all the trimmings of the perfect hipster\nhideout. The music was an oddly mismatched\ncombination of folk, electronica, and pop. Perhaps it would be best described as a folktronica\ngig but some of the acts certainly didn\u2019t fit this\ndescription. This night was part of HMV\u2019s Next\nBig Thing series of concerts, and all of these\nartists have a great deal of promise, though I\nhesitate to patronise the main act, James Yuill,\nin such a way, since he has already settled into\na fine niche in the folktronica scene (if such a\nscene could be said to exist at all).\nThe first act was boy/girl combo Visions of\nTrees. Amongst the slew of Bat For Lashes\ncopycats, few have managed to match Natasha\nKhan in any way. Only Florence Welch comes\nto mind as a possibility, but in Visions of Trees\nthere is perhaps a new band to eventually take\nthe title of creepy, fairy-like, female, electron-ic-folk artist of the moment. Their songs follow\na well trodden path of ghostly whispered vocals\nover a sparse yet heavy harmony of strings/pi-ano/noise, a path that was first walked by Kate\nBush in the 80s, and a style that has apparently\nnot been bettered since then. In that sense, Visions of Trees are completely mediocre, but\nthey have some catchy songs and they play one\nof the most enjoyable genres around so they are\ndefinitely worth a listen.\nThe second band were Trophy Wife, a band\nthat I had seen before and liked a lot \u2013 mostly\ndue to their simultaneously disturbing and enthralling cover of Joanna Newsom\u2019s \u2018Book of\nRight-On\u2019 (Look for it on Myspace, Newsom\nfans will be amazed at how well it works). This\ntime, they were even better, perhaps the musical highlight of the evening. They are a band\nvery similar in musical style to Holy Fuck \u2013 a\nA night at the Garage\nJames Yuill: the epitomy of pure musical geekery. An inspiration to many\nquartet of musicians stood around an island of\nwires, keyboards and guitars while each one\ndanced vigorously and still managed to play\nhis part effortlessly well. One of the most striking aspects of Trophy Wife\u2019s setup was their\nhome-made drum kit: a wooden frame housed\na mixing desk and a large number of regularly\nand violently beaten polystyrene pads. As with\nHoly Fuck, Trophy Wife\u2019s appeal lies in their\nvery humble take on dance music; it is very re-freshing, and interesting, to find a band making\ndance music with traditional, non-computer-ised instruments.\nThird on stage, and after a painfully long gap,\nwas the one pop act of the evening, CocknBullKid. She is an indecisive songwriter who\nperforms a variety of styles, but whereas other\ngenre-spanning artists (Animal Collective\nimmediately comes to mind) give off an air\nof well-rounded musical knowledge drawing\nlinks between otherwise distant genres, CocknBullKid simply seems confused and unsure of\nher position in the very wide and complex spectrum of modern music. New single \u2018Hold on\nto Your Misery\u2019 is extremely reminiscient of S\nClub 7, whereas \u2018One Eye Closed\u2019 could easily\nbe Britney\u2019s next single. On the other hand, the\nsuperb eponymous track Cocknbullkid is perhaps best described as experimental 80s dance-rock, a welcome break from the trashy 90s pop\nthat made up the rest of her set\nAdequately disheartened, I very eagerly\nawaited JamesYuill who came on stage dressed\nlike the definition of a music geek in a Lyle &\nScott shirt and thickly rimmed nerd glasses,\nhis Macbook on prominent display. I had seen\nJames Yuill once before at XOYO on Old Street\nand his lovely mixture of folktronica and rave\nmusic was entrancing. This night was very\nsimilar, the undisputed highlight being the folky\n\u2018This Sweet Love\u2019, beautifully accompanied by\nan animated video of balloons, boats and mous-taches. The occasional rave moments dimmed\nthe lights into a club atmosphere, but these were\nintelligent songs with a rare combination of\ncomplexity and danceability. Yuill is a fantastic musician who deftly and intelligently stole\nthe show with simple, assured maturity, but the\nyounger Trophy Wife impressed everyone with\nan effortless and supremely enjoyable set.\nGregory Power\nImperial\u2019s own blues maestros, The Tin Can\n44s, have released their first studio recording: a\nfive-track gem called The Speak Easy EP. Everyone who attended the first Felix Music Night\non the 19th of February will remember The Tin\nCans as \u201cthat wild bunch of whiskey-swiggers\u201d\nthat kept us grooving during the totality of\ntheir tight, raw set. Pretty damn classy, indeed.\nTheir EP was recorded over two day sessions\nat Alchemea Studios in Angel, Islington, and is\navailable for free up on their Bandcamp.\nAll songs were written by bandleader Phil\nOverton, who possesses a God-given grace on\nthe guitar, recalling the technical, Jazz-influenced guitar work of acts such as The Yardbirds. Whereas in concert their goal is clearly\nto make you dance till your feet fall off, on\nrecord the intricate level of their musicianship\nand the tightness of their act really becomes ap-parent: they chug through these five tracks like\na well-oiled machine, fueled on whiskey.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, tracks like \u2018Bad Craziness\u2019 and \u2018Three Coats\u2019 will make you boogie\nlike a wookie, but it is in the softer moments of\n\u2018Now They Know\u2019 the band really shows how\ninteresting their compositions and teamwork\nare. Overton\u2019s Knopfler-esque riffing complements his end-of-the-line vocals \u2013 reminding\nthis humble reviewer of early Dylan \u2013 whilst\ndrummer Aaron Berk shows skillful restraint.\nBerk then tips the song into more rocky territo-ry, leading into a crescendo of wild harmonica\ntomfoolery by the brilliant Box Car Joe.\n\u2018Picket Song\u2019 feels like the intro to a good\nold-fashioned Cowboy-bar brawl. \u2018After The\nShow\u2019 will make all the ladies want a piece\nof the action (\u201cGet Laid Easy\u201d tip number 34:\nlearn to play this on the guitar).\nAll in all, an extremely solid debut, and a\npleasure on the ears of anyone with a taste for\nbluesy folk.\nGet the free EP on the band\u2019s bandcamp:\nhttp://thetincan44s.bandcamp.com\nThe Tin Can 44s perform at an \u201cacoustic\ncircus\u201d every Sunday in Whitechapel.

The reason for the closure, which\nwas first reported in Felix in February,\nis unknown as NatWest has repeatedly\ndeclined to comment.\nSince being notified of the closure in\nFebruary, Imperial has been working on\nmitigating the impact of the closure of\nthe branch, which is used by many stu-dents, staff and College services.\nIn a memo sent out to senior staff on\nthe 6th of May, Malcolm Aldridge, the\nCollege Financial Controller, set out the\nplans that have been put in place to deal\nwith the situation. Cash from College\nshops and services will now be processed through a dedicated secure room\nin the Sherfield building. Loomis (UK)\n3\nFELIX Friday 13 may 2011\nNEWS\nThe government is considering proposals to allow universities to offer extra\nplaces on their courses at market prices,\noutside the government loans system.\nStudents entering university in this way\ncould pay fees similar to that of overseas students without any public funding and they would also have to meet\nthe entry requirements of the course.\nThe development came on Radio 4\u2019s\nToday programme when universities\nminister David Willetts suggested that\ncharities or businesses may wish to sponsor places for students. For example, the\naccountancy firm KPMG has unveiled a\nplan to pay fees for students at universities including Durham, in a training\nprogram leading to an honours degree in\naccounting.

Sorting out bank accounts is a major concern for international students and they benefited from\nhaving a bank on campus with experience in dealing with international student issues.\nThe College is planning to allow payments to newly-arrived international\nstudents who don\u2019t have UK accounts\n(previously made by College cheques\nwhich could be cashed at the branch)\nto be made to foreign accounts by wire\ntransfer, or a UK-resident\u2019s account, although the College say that they cannot\nof the architects involved in the SEQ\nproject, Foster and Partners and Sheppard Robson, responded to requests for\ncomment. Several efforts to contact Dr\nMartin Knight were unsuccessful at the\ntime of writing.\nIn addition to last week\u2019s news that a\n\u00a33 million exhaust system for test engines was built with galvanised steel\ninstead of stainless steel \u2013 an error that\nmeant the exhaust wouldn\u2019t \u201cstand up to\nlong-term use\u201d, as the College described\nit \u2013 a number of other errors have delayed the renovation process. The most\nembarrassing is the news that sensitive\nmeasuring devices in a materials testing lab are disrupted by vibrations from\nresearchers walking in the lab because\nthe floor is too thin. Additionally the lab\nin which the test engines are situated\nhas not been adequately sound-proofed,\nwith questions raised about whether\nsound-proofing was in the original\nrecommendations, and the ventilation\nspace below the floor has been blocked\noff, meaning that researchers will be unable clean up fuel spillages or retrieve\nequipment if they drop it through grilles\nin the floor.\nThe College are currently involved\nin an investigation on the cause of the\nblunder with the \u00a33 million exhaust system as well negotiations about the final\ncost of the refurbishment and did not\nwish to comment specifically on the issues raised in this article. Steve Howe,\nDirector of Capital Projects and Planning at Imperial, previously stressed\nthat the liability for the exhaust mistake\nwas still unknown and didn\u2019t rule out\nthe possibility that Imperial would have\nto meet some of the extra costs.\nA College spokesperson issued this\nstatement: \u201cThe College is taking seriously the remaining issues involved in\nthe completion of the Mechanical Engineering refurbishment, and is working\nwith the Department and the contractors to address them.

The prediction was\nmade in 1915 by Italian-born seismologist Raffaele\nBendandi, who forecast Rome would be devastated\nby a quake on 11 May 2011. Despite officials stressing the unpredictable nature of quakes, hundreds\nof workers requested leave and families chose to\nkeep their children away from school amid fears that\nBendandi\u2019s forecast may become true.\nWith scenes of devastation left by the recent\nearthquake in Japan and memories of the 2009\nquake in the Italian city of L\u2019Aquila, the concerns\ncirculating amongst Italians this week were un-derstandable. A prediction made by Bendandi has\nbecome true in the past. In 1923, he forecast an\nearthquake would strike on January 2 the following\nyear. On 4 January 1924, the Italian province of Le\nMarche was struck by a quake.\nDespite his apparent knack for forecasting, scep-tics this week downplayed Bendandi\u2019s prediction of\nan earthquake in Rome, saying they had no record\nof a specific date and place. The potential for predicting earthquakes has been the focus of much\ncontroversy. Bernandi based his quake predictions\non the movement of the moon, sun and planets,\nyet some scientists argue it is impossible for us to\npredict such an event, namely because they often\ntend to strike in a random fashion, without warning.\nTo date, there are no examples of forecasts that\nhave successfully predicted the exact date, place\nand size of an earthquake. Felix was still waiting for\nnews of a quake at the time of print...\nThea Cunningham\nScientists at Imperial and the University of\nWashington have taken an important new step\ntowards controlling malaria by genetically\nmodifying mosquitoes.\nMalaria affects 300 million people every year\nand, as it is one of the infamous \u2018Big Three\u2019 infectious diseases, eradication is a global goal.\nScientists have already succeeded in creating\n\u2018malaria-resistant mosquitoes\u2019, which are modified in ways that target the mosquito\u2019s ability\nto transmit the disease. But until now the main\nsticking point has been trying to find a way to\nensure that this trait is maintained in wild popu-lations. As they do not offer the mosquito an\nadvantage, the modified traits tend to disappear\nshortly after the mosquitoes are released.\nThese most recent developments tackle this\nproblem by inserting a gene called I-Scel,\nwhich is a homing endonuclease, into the\nmosquito genome. This sequence produces an\nenzyme which deactivates a target gene and replaces it with a copy of itself. As this occurs in\nthe mosquito\u2019s sperm cells, the I-Scel sequence\nis inherited by nearly all its offspring. In this\nstudy the gene targeted for inactivation by IScel was simply a green fluorescent marker for\nease of observation, but further research will\nnow aim to target genes needed by the mosquito for reproduction or transmission of the\nmalaria parasite.\nIt is hoped that this will result in a low cost,\nhighly effective malaria control strategy,\nthough much further research is required. Professor Andrea Crisanti, a senior author of the\nstudy said: \u201cWe expect to conduct many more\nexperiments to determine its safety and reliability.\u201d\nManaging malaria with modified mozzies\nChloe McIvor\nEver looked at the squandered energy shimmering off hundreds of idling, traffic-jammed\ncars and wondered, \u201ccouldn\u2019t we do something\nwith that?\u201d\nThe waste heat problem has puzzled scientists for decades. Some researchers predict that\nwaste heat from wind turbines could have a\nsmall global warming effect, leaving us with\nan ever greater need for a solution. However,\nscientists from China and America may have\nthe answer \u2013 thermoelectric generators.\nThe generators \u2013 which convert heat into\nelectricity \u2013 have been around for a while. But\nthe materials they are based on are inefficient\nand have only found use in niche applications\nlike powering space probes. The team has uncovered a talented alloy of lead and tellurium\nthat could change all that.\nWhen electricity flows between conductors,\nthe moving electrons carry heat with them,\ncausing one conductor to heat up and the other\nto cool down. The reverse is also true \u2013 if you\nheat a circuit containing two different conduc-tors, electricity will start to flow. This is known\nas the Seebeck effect, after physicist Thomas\nJohann Seebeck who discovered it in 1821.\nThe thermoelectric problem lies in finding\nmaterials with a high zT value. A material\u2019s zT\nvalue is the relationship between its Seebeck\nvalue, its conductivity, and the temperature.\nTo make a useful thermoelectric generator, zT\nshould be at least 1.5 \u2013 for this it needs a high\nSeebeck value, high electric conductivity, and\nlow thermal conductivity.\nBy carefully adding sodium and selenium to\ntheir alloy, and by manipulating its structure\nat the nano scale, the researchers were able to\ncreate a material with \u2018valleys\u2019 that conducted\nelectricity more readily, while keeping thermal\nconductivity low. When heated to 577\u00b0C, the\nmaterial has a zT value of 1.8, an achievement\nthe team has labelled \u201cextraordinary\u201d. The\nresearch, published in Nature, could soon be\ntransforming thermoelectric generators from\nniche nobodies into heroes \u2013 delivering extra\npower whilst effortlessly cooling our world.\nJames Pope\nDevice reaches the final heat\nThe Romans earthquake-proofed this, right?\nAs the temperature soared, the heat was on to make use of it\nScientists create generator to make use of waste heat\nIt\u2019s been so hot lately even the mosquitoes have been dropping like flies\n20 May 2011 6.30pm\nArchitectural Association School of Architecture, 36\nBedford Sq, London\nAs part of a new collaborative energy exhibition \u2018Feel\nthe force\u2019, Imperial cosmologist Professor Andrew\nJaffe, architect Shin Egashira and photographer Goswin Schwedinger explore the human desire to alter\nour past and future, and question whether science\nfiction is any closer to becoming science fact.\nTime Travel \u2013\nShamanism to the Space Age\n\n"

    "content": "7\nFELIX Friday 13 MAY 2011\nFEATURE\nthe highly expensive payloads, which\nmust come into play. Of course, one\ncould argue that paying private companies to take astronauts into space is\nsimply the natural, logical extension of\nthese companies\u2019 work sending various\nsatellites into orbit. However, if NASA\u2019s\nshuttle programme is ultimately being\nscrapped on account of concerns surrounding its safety, it is only fair to apply these same stringent standards when\nassessing the shuttle\u2019s likely successors.\nIn March, a Taurus XL rocket, built by\nthe Orbital Sciences Corporation, plummeted to Earth after its final stage failed\nto separate properly. And it wasn\u2019t the\nfirst time the Taurus XL rockets have\nfailed to launch successfully. Back in\n2009, the same problem occurred during separation of the rocket\u2019s final stage,\nresulting in the loss of the new orbiting\ncarbon observatory, which for the first\ntime would have shown scientists the\ngeographical distribution of carbon dioxide sources and sinks on a regional\nscale. In total, Taurus rockets have been\nlaunched nine times since their debut in\n1994. Only six of these nine missions\nhave successfully made it into orbit.\nSo, with private companies having success rates as low as these, the amount of\nmoney lost due to payload destruction\nalso quickly becomes a factor.\nHowever, as well as issues of safety\nand finance, there are also political motives to consider. The decision to transfer a large portion of NASA\u2019s space\noperation into the hands of private companies seems to be part of a wider vogue\nfor decreasing federal expenditure. Of\ncourse, there is the necessity to reduce\nthe US budget deficit, but, in accusations similar to those being made on this\nside of the Atlantic, there are those who\nwould argue that the Republican-controlled House of Representatives is keen\nto make cuts for ideological reasons.\nStalwart economic liberals argue\nthat it is only through competition that\none can hope to drive the innovation\nrequired for developing the future of\nspaceflight. They often point to the\nspace race, which ultimately ended\nwith US triumph in 1969, as proof of\nthe necessity of competition. In many\nways, Americans see this triumph as a\nvictory for US capitalism over Soviet\ncommunism; as proof that the big state\ncannot drive innovation in the way that\nprivate enterprise can. However, what\nadvocates of this argument seem quick\nto forget is that, at the height of the\nApollo programme, the US was spending a staggering 4.5% of its total federal budget on the space programme.\nWith federal funding levels as high\nas this, one can hardly claim US success in the space race as proof of the\nsuperior driving power of liberal free\nmarkets.\nOf course, it is understandable that\nNASA no longer receives federal funding as high as 4.5%, particularly in light\nof the global financial crisis. Today,\nNASA receives around 0.5% of the federal budget, and from this they carry out\na whole host of research activities in addition to spaceflight. Yet, this 0.5% still\namounts to $18.7bn per year. So, with\nspaceflight as expensive as this, perhaps\nit\u2019s time to abandon the idea of international competition as a driver for future\nexploration of space, whether that\u2019s\ncompetition between competing companies or between competing nations.\nIt is no-longer fair for nations like ours\nto expect the US to bear the brunt of the\nburden in pushing the boundaries of\nspace exploration forward. Perhaps we\nshould see the shuttle fleet\u2019s retirement\nthis year as an opportunity to increase\ninternational collaboration for the future of spaceflight. The US and Russian\nSpace agencies are already working\ntogether on a range of projects, and the\nEuropean Space Agency is increasingly\nbecoming a key player. But perhaps\nthe future of manned spaceflight, particularly in terms of going back to the\nMoon and on to Mars, will rely on collaborations between the superpowers of\nold and the new rising big players in the\nspace industry, such as China, India and\neven Brazil. Instead of the shuttle fleet\u2019s\nretirement spelling the end of an era,\nperhaps it can be used to signal the start\nof a new beginning, when national interests are cast aside in favour of greater\nhumanitarian goals.\nOf course, there are those who would\nargue that the entire concept of manned\nspaceflight is a waste of time and mon-ey, particularly when there are large\nnumbers of people living without basic\nresources here on Earth. Yet, in light\nof the mounting list of threats which\nendanger us all, regardless of nationality or political persuasion, there has\nperhaps never been a time when it has\nbeen more pressing for us to push forward with the exploration of our solar\nsystem. On this subject, Stephen Hawking has had this to say: \u201cLife on Earth\nis at the ever-increasing risk of being\nwiped out by a disaster such as sudden\nglobal warming, nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus or other dangers\n[...] I think the human race has no future\nif it doesn\u2019t go into space.\u201d\nIn many ways, despite the Challenger\nand Columbia tragedies, the shuttle programme can be seen as a victim of its\nown success. For the US, the shuttle\nwas a way of showing that it had well\nand truly won the space race. It was\nsupposed to show that spaceflight had\nbecome easy, that it was a routine part\nof everyday American life. This idea\nwas even reflected in the name:\u2018the\nshuttle\u2019, as well as the frequency with\nwhich launches took place. However, as\nspaceflight has become routine, it has\nalso lost its glamour. So, perhaps the\nfuture of manned spaceflight is not only\ndependent on getting the technology\nright, but also the PR. Perhaps space\nexploration once more needs the great\nidealistic goals which drove it in the\nsixties, if we are to expand humanity\u2019s\nhorizons in space. Personally, I could\nthink of no greater motivation for this\nthan the prospect of all nations working\ntogether to explore deeper into our solar\nsystem. If we are capable of doing this,\nthen perhaps our horizons will have\nbeen expanded before we even take off.\nLast month, NASA announced it\nwas awarding a total of $270m to\nprivate companies currently developing the next generation of low\nEarth-orbit spacecraft. Eventually,\nthese companies will sell seats in\ntheir vehicles to NASA and other\nspace agencies seeking to put astronauts into orbit.\nThe $270m award was split\nbetween four US companies:\nSpaceX, Blue Origin, Boeing and\nSierra Nevada Corporation. The\nlargest individual award went to\nBoeing, who hope to have their\nCST-100 capsule ready to transport astronauts by 2015. This, like\nthe other companies\u2019 vehicles, will\nnot be capable of launching into\nspace. Instead, it will simply serve\nas a crew capsule, which can be\nmounted on top of current rocket\ndesigns, such as those frequently\nused to put commercial satellites\ninto space.\nBy contrast, Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic is planning\na whole new way of getting into\nspace. Unlike the four companies\nwhich NASA has awarded money\nto, Virgin Galactic is not about\nputting astronauts into space.\nInstead, it\u2019s all about putting ordinary people (albeit \u2018ordinary\npeople\u2019 with a spare \u00a3100,000)\ninto space. Last week, successful tests of this spacecraft,\nnamed \u2018SpaceShipTwo\u2019, brought\nthe dream of space tourism yet\nanother step closer to reality. Virgin Galactic hopes to start taking\npassengers into space within the\nnext two years.\nWho will win the new space race?\n\n"
