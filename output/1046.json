    "content": "TWENTY-TWO . FELIX FRIDAY JANUARY 1 9TH1995 LETTERS\nLetters to Felix: Edited by Alex Fe a kes Bully for him! Dear Editor,\nThe Government of this\ncountry has recently gone to\ngreat lengths to inform us that\nBritish beef is safe to eat. The\nmedical profession seem to be\ndivided on this one, some say that\nthey themselves steer clear\n(excuse the pun), others claim\nthe evidence is insufficient to\nconvince them that beef is\nunsafe. What does the public do?\nLargely, it ignores the Government and finds solace in agreement with some medical people\nand stop eating beef.\nThe Government of this\ncountry has recently informed us\nthat it is safe to drink more alcohol than we have been. The medical profession seems un amino us on its disagreement with this\nstatement and clearly tells us that\nit is a poison to the liver and\nshould not be drunk in anything\nlike the quan a ties the\nGovernment now stipulates as\nsafe. What does the public do?\nLargely, it ignores the medical\npeople and finds solace in agreement with the Government and\ngoes and gets pissed.\nThe Government of this\ncountry has recently re informed us of the dangers of taking drugs,\neven the popular youth drug\necstasy. The medical profession\nseems to wholeheartedly agree\nwith this line. The police also\nstrongly encourage abstention\nfrom drug taking, as the dangers\nto the user have been graphically\nhighlighted, and the immoral\nactivities that drug money funds\nare becoming more apparent.\nWhat does the public do? Well it\nseems divided on this one.\nParents seem worried about\ndrugs and try to educate their\nkids, but many young people\nignore the Government and the\nmedical people and go out and\nget stoned.\nDo I have a conclusion? Well\nI suppose it shows that people do\nwhatever they like, but try. to\nlook to an author at ive voice to\njustify their decision, and if one\ncan't be found then they just\nplace themselves on superior\nground and assume nobody else\nknows what they are talking\nabout. Do I have a recommend a tion? If you drink in excess then\nstop! If you are doing drugs then\nstop! Beef? no comment!\nTrevor Addenbrooke (Civil\nEngineering).\nA bit of a mouthful just to come\nto a point about not doing drugs,\ndon't you think?\nGraduation joy? Dear Rachel,\nJust a note to let you know\nthat contrary to the column\n'News in Brief in January 12th' s Felix, the two graduation ceremonies planned for 1996 will be\nheld on:\nWednesday, 1 May 1996,\nThursday, 24 October 1996.\nThe May ceremony will be\ndevoted exclusively to the award\nof higher degrees, and the\nOctober Commemoration Day\nceremony will be for undergraduates. Both ceremonies will take\nplace at the Royal Albert Hall.\nJohn Vandridge-Am.es,\nAssistant Registrar.\nICs radioactivity on record Dear Felix,\nRE: The positive net benefits\nof working with radioactivity.\nWithout the use of radioactive tracers research in the bio-logical, biochemical and medical\nfields, our understanding of diseases and the ability to cure\nwould be severly hampered.\nThese can be used in minute\namounts and they can be targeted\nto specific molecular sites.\nRadioactivity can also be used in\nhospitals as a cure in cancer treatments and as a diagnostic tool.\nNatural radioactivity is with all\nthe time: it is present in the\nSouthside Shop\nAll Sandwiches 75p after 5:00p.m.& it\n10% StudentDiscoun\non General Groceries\nJust show your Imperial College Student I.D. card to\nthe cashier before buying your goods.\n\n"

Some of\nthe positive advantages of paving the\nearth, they say, are the total depletion of\nnatural resources and the extinction of\nall plant life and \"critters\" (except for\ncows, which will be cultivated underground to provide us with those all-important burgers).

    "content": "two . Felix Friday January 1 9th1996 News News in brief\nR CSU anger\nover office move\nBY ANDYS IN HA RAY The Royal College of Science\nUnion has been voicing concern\nover its move to the Civil\nEngineering Department. The\nold office was located at the back\nof the Old Chemistry Building,\nwhich is due to be demolished to\nmake way for the new BMS block. A temporary office was set\nup in the Biology department\nbefore Christmas, but this must\nbe vacated at the end of the\nmonth. They R CSU will then\nmove to new offices, currently\nbeing prepared in Civ Eng.\nThe R CSU President, Mo Dulloo, said that initially the\nplans for the move had been well\norganised. \"Estates figured out\nthe plan last term, and the plans\nfor the office [in Civ Eng] were\npretty damn smart... on the\nwhole it was good.\" However, he\nwas concerned that College was\nproceeding very quickly with the\ndevelopment at the expense of\nfull consultation with the R CSU. Problems first surfaced over\ntheir Motor Club garage, in\nwhich their fire engine, j ez, is\nstored. \"At that particular point\nin time, they assured us that Jez\nwouldn't have to be moved,\" Mo\nsaid, and added that on the last\nday of term, the college Fire\nOfficer, Graham Cox, told them\nthat they would be able to move\nthe vehicle to a Chelsea garage in\nJanuary.\nThen on December 19th they were told that Jez would\nhave to be moved the i ol lowing day: \"they pulled a fast one on us\nbig time... It took a whole day\nwith a dozen people, and at such\nshort notice... it was fucking stu-pid.\" He added that some ex-stu-dents had taken the day off work\nto come and help out.\nIt has also emerged that during the Christmas Holiday,\nDeputy President (Finance &\nServices) Matt Crompton, was\nasked by the Estates Division to\nmove the RCSU's equipment\nout of storage in Southside,\nalthough they later relented on\nthe grounds that there was\nnowhere else to put the equipment and that the storeroom\nwould require \"at least 12 man-days\" to clear out.\nThe R CSU office is set to\nmove out of its current premises\nat the end of the month. Initially\nuncertain of their office's new\nlocation, Mo said, \"My impression is that we'll be homeless\",\nthough he has since learned that\nwork at the Civ Eng site is progressing well and may be complete by the the time the R CSU office is required to move.\nTalking to Felix, workers at\nPHOTO: ALEX FEAKES\nAn electrician putting the final\ntouches to a fuse box in the\nnew R CSU office.\nthe site were keen to complete\nthe garage area by this Friday,\nand the office itself in a couple of\nweeks.\nThe R CSU President nevertheless remains angry with the\nmanner in which the Estates\nDivision have handled their\nmove. He said, \"We'll move,\nwe'll move again, my concern is\nthat we have a working office.\"\nHe assured Felix that the\nRCSU's administration and\norganisation of events had been\nunaffected.\nBY THE NEWS TEAM Security deputy-Kenneth Weir, who took the job\nof Deputy Head of Security at\nthe beginning of this term after\nTerry Briley had to take an\nextended leave of absence, has\nurged students who have lost\nproperty to check with them.\nItems waiting to be claimed are\nkept for three months before\nthey are disposed of, and there is\na lot of property yet to be\nclaimed which will soon reach\nthe disposal date.\nMr. Weir also stressed that\nlost swipe cards are liabilities\nuntil they are deactivated. He added that security should be\ninformed at the earliest opportunity after losing one - if found,\ncards can easily be reactivated at\nsecurity control.\nStudent survey\nA student survey conducted at\nthe beginning of last term could\nform the basis for how the South\nKensington campus looks in a few years time. The survey questioned returning second year students on their opinions regarding\nvarious aspects of life at IC. The\nsurvey asked questions on the\nquality of the student accommodation, and the services provided\naround college.\nThe results of the questionnaire have been released to Felix\nand make interesting reading, the\nsample of approximately 700\nstudents representing a return of\n39% on the survey.\nAlthough the majority\nthought that student rents in\nwest London were too expensive,\nthey were unwilling to share\nrooms in order to save money.\nHowever, most of the students\nwouldn't mind doing their own\ncleaning if it meant paying less\nrent, and most would want to\nlive in halls again in their second\nyear. 60 students even preferred\nnot to clean their rooms at all!\nThe college catering service\ndid not come in for as high praise\nas the halls, a considerable proportion having used neither\nBasics nor Southside Bar.\nHowever, the ex-Linsteadians\namongst the group wholeheartedly condemned the service in\nLinstead's dining room.\nClearly most students here\nkeep their money under their\nbeds, as a high proportion rated a bank as being the most important\nretail outlet to have on campus.\nSurely \"that Bank\"'s advertising\ncan't have been so low-key?\nAfter the bank, a chemist and a Post Office were the most popular amenities.\nStudents were offered an\nincentive to reply to the ques-tion n aire, in the form of a prize\ndraw for a \u00a325 gift voucher. Felix\ncan reveal the winner as P Linkshwaran from Civ Eng.\nCongratulations, P. IC Prof on TV\nProfessor Michael RowanRobinson of the Physics department was on television on\nTuesday evening talking about\nthe Hubble Space Telescope.\nThe telescope had been left on\nfor ten days pointing at the same\nplace, and had caught an amazing\n1500 galaxies on film. Professor\nRowan-Robinson was called on to\nexplain some of the features of\nthe photograph, and its relevance\nto his research group's work.\nDropout rates up\nNational newspapers reported\nthis week that student drop-out\nrates across the country were up\nby 10% on last year, and those\nleaving due to failed exams grew\nby 20%.\nThe main reason for the\nincrease was said to be financial\npressures, which forced students\nto work to raise extra cash and\ntherefore spend less time on\ntheir studies.\nIt's... YOU!\nSomeone, somewhere at IC has\nwon an awful lot of money\n(\u00a390k) on the lottery. It seems\nthat scientific method might be\nthe best way to choose those\nnumbers.\nFancy buying us all a pint?\n\n"

The evening had become an away meeting of the Circus\nSkills society when one of the locals produced a large bag of clubs, balls and diablo s to\nentertain us after a day with no flying.\nWe rapidly adjusted to the fact that there would be no flying at all on this gliding trip -the snow and ice prevented our gliders from even getting up the hill to The Long Mynd airfield\n- they stayed at the bottom all week! Even the cars were hurriedly moved down when it was\npointed out to us that they would have been snowed in for several days after we planned to\nleave.\nThe trip had seemed such a good idea last term..\nAfter the success of our visit to the Midland Gliding Club last Easter our tales of sharing\nthe landing area with sheep, flying beneath the clubhouse and midnight dunking s enthused the\nclub with a desire to come back again. The locals parting comment at the time of \"How about\nNew Year?\" sealed it.\nDespite the poor weather and our buying up the local town's stock of toboggans some\nflying of sorts was done during the week - Matt managed to pass his Bronze \" C\" written paper.\nWhen he completes the bronze with a few more solo's he will be ready to fly cross country on\nhis own...\nNew year itself was celebrated in style, with many of the locals walking up the hill for the\nparty. Although the beer was discovered to be frozen (!) a heater was quickly applied so that\nwe could see 1996 in in appropriate fashion. A good time was had, but when the water ran out\nthe following morning (for the third time) we decided to quit while we were ahead! Anyone\nfor an Easter trip?\nForthcoming Events:\nOn 20th January (tomorrow!) Bill Giles, BBC Weatherman, will be giving a talk at\nLasham and I CGC will be running a minibus down there. Contact j hm@ doc.ic.ac.uk if you\nwant a place. Our annual dinner will also be this term - watch out for details.\nAs always, if you haven't had a go at this flying lark yet, and fancy a go, come to a Thursday meeting (Aero. 266, l2 pm) or mail gliding@ic.ac.uk. See you soon!\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022 simone r \u2022il ill ll ll j iii iii l Ill ll ll Sg lli gill ill ll ll ll ll ll ll ll l Happy New Year! It's great to be\nback. As Felix reported last week, I have been on holiday for the last\ncouple of weeks, and since most of\nyou will have simply been lazing\naround over Christmas, I thought\nthat it would be nice to tell you\nwhat wild and wacky things I got\nup to. Revision. Sleep. I knew you\nwould be green with envy. Not\neverybody's idea of a 'holiday', but\nI'm not bitter. Speaking of the\nexams, I do hope the cheques didn't fall out of\nmy answer booklets. I made them out to Cash,\nsince I wasn't sure who got which questions...\nStill, two exams and a bottle of paracetamol\nlater, it's time to bang the world to rights. You\nleave the place for a few weeks and look what\nhappens? The blue sign men have made a commando raid on the College after their initial foray\nlast term and completely overwhelmed us. Does\nthis mean a Royal Visit is imminent? Now don't get me wrong, they look very nice, but at what\ncost? When one considers the inevitable committees involved in choosing the design - I bet\nthis project has been at least 10 years in the off-ing- and putting the damn things up, the total\nprice of them would probably bale out a dozen\nRag fiascoes or build some new Chemistry lectures theatres. Speaking of which...\nThe Portakabins arrived. The fence went up.\nSome signs went up. The fence was painted.\nSome signs went up. Arrows were painted on\nthe road. Some signs went up. What is it about\nImperial and bloody signs? Does Ian Caldwell\nhave shares in the company that's supplying\nthem? The public should be told. As for the new\nmedical building, I understand that they still do\nnot have planning permission. Dear reader, isn't it a \u2022funny old world? When Sherfield was being\nplanned, permission was not granted and went\nto appeal, before which we apparently sent the bulldozers in to rip\ndown the glorious Imperial\nInstitute. Now we have a building\nthat looks like Blitz damage is waiting to be put right and we're playing\nit by the rules. We are a much more\nvirtuous bunch at IC these days.\nAnd besides, 170 Queensgate is a tad more salubrious than\nWormwood Scrubs. If that new\nbuilding is up in 18 months time, I 'll\neat my hat. If that old building is\ndown in 18 months...\nOne of the bones of contention seems to be\nthe provision of social facilities for the medics.\nHaving seen some of our dear colleagues from\nMary's at the Management School Christmas\ndinner, I suspect this means that they are holding out for a boxing ring. The rest of the campus\nmanage without enormous social provisions for\nindividual departments, so why are they so special? You're not shy, are you? All we need is to\nboot a few paper shifter s off the t bird floor of\nSherfield and the problem is solved.\nAmong the unusually large number of good\nTV programmes on at Christmas was a brilliant\ndocumentary about the Royal Yacht Britannia on\nits last State visit to South Africa. Here we have\none of the most powerful symbols of British\nprestige, projecting an enormously positive\nimage to the world, that never fails to leave\nonlookers awestruck. And yet despite such obvious diplomatic and economic benefits, and a relatively low operating cost (\u00a312million per year,\nwhich is 21 minutes of government spending),\nher future is in doubt, as is a replacement. How\ncan the government allow such penny-pinching\nto jeo pardi se our public image? For God's sake,\nwe are not a Third World country, and if we cannot afford such a relatively small sum, then do\nwe really deserve the institution of monarchy?\ntheatre: resolution! Stephen and thalia\nWe often get so overwhelmed by the well\nknown shows that we don't notice the interesting stuff happening on the sidelines. Resolution is\na very big idea which hardly anyone knows\nabout. A showcase for new dance companies or\nexperimental work from here and abroad, with\na different show each night, this a chance to\nexperience contemporary dance of all kinds.\nStephen:\nI 'll begin at the end and proceed in an\norderly fashion to the beginning. The last of\nWednesday's three performances was\nSubcutaneous HaUucination by 4D. Five minutes of pure fun and a perfect ending to the\nnight. The Isigi Company's Scream1\n.1\n.1\n, was an\nemotional and very powerful piece of political\nexpression, which brings me to my favourite\nperformance, Chiaroscuro by Whoopee Stomp.\nIf the second piece was thought provoking,\nthen this was question provoking. Wow! Go\nand see them. Overall I 've never experienced\nsuch a wide range of reactions to a piece of per-form ance. Thalia:\nThe Dance Xchange Ensemble opened the\nevening with a piece about twins, shown mainly\nthrough 'mirror dancing'. Symmetry was hated,\nlost and embraced, but it all ended happily with\na kiss after some violent hak-pulling. It would\nhave benefited from being a bit tighter, though.\nThey followed that with Solo, a group piece\nwhich involved a lot of enthusiastic women\njumping up and down and fainting. I couldn't see\na theme but their big grins caught on -1 loved it.\nThe second company...? There is only so\nlong a dancer can stand stock-still in a spotlight\nlistening to a heart beat.\nSo all awards go to the last lot, Momentary\nFusion. Their use of trapeze and ropes was brilliant. The last two girls were dancing in the air as\nif gravity didn't exist, falling and catching each\nother, eyes closed in mid air. I can't think how\nstrong they must have been. My money's on this\nbunch if they enter Gladiators. Fab.\n\n"

No matter your gender, age, colour, creed, sexual orientation, height,\nweight, social class, favourite football team or preferred brand of hot chocolate, you to can become an\ninstant household name with the Open Mic Awards.

By leaving the all important judging decision to the very people who pay to see live comedy, rather than a couple of clueless has-been s who think\nthat Reeves & Mortimer are a firm of chartered accountants, the award manages to keep in touch with th\ntaste of Hie genera public and neatly side ste pliny kind of urn! comedy industry shenanigans.\nBetter still, the fact that local people will bells es singa local comedian means the Open Mic Award\nremains free of London bias.

L5\" lT0, G30; 8.5(3\nT. ti, k.41 stp tif, StU- 1\n- film: something to talk about a rah turner\nWell, this film seems to have had pretty good\nreviews on the whole. But I dare to be different:\nI disagree. In fact, I don't think its anything\nworth talking about at all.\nJulia Roberts plays Grace, the Southern\nwife of Eddie (Dennis Quaid), who has a very\nannoying daughter (Haley AulTj. (She's very similar to Hannah in Neighbours, if you watch that.\nI don't, honest.)\nGrace's life falls apart when she finds out\nthat Eddie is cheating on her. In one of the film's better scenes, in the middle of a women-only\ncharity meeting, she blurts out, 'Could everyone\nelse who has slept with my husband please put\nup their hand?'.\nShe turns to her family for help, but gets no\nsupport from her overpowering and over unsympathetic father, who can only think of the effect\nhis daughter's broken marriage is having on his\nbusiness. In fact, the only one who seems to care\nis her sister, who doesn't hesitate in letting Eddie\nknow what she thinks of him!\nAfter threatening to wreck almost every\nother marriage in town, and even poisoning her\nhusband when he asks for forgiveness, Grace\nstarts to rebuild her life. She then quits her job,\ngoes back to college, and even finds herself a new\nman. But there is just one problem - she is still in\nlove with Eddie.\nThere's not much sex, and little violence in\nthe film which revolves around nothing more\nthan a family and its horses. Only the bit of tad'\nlanguage gives it an undeserved 15 certificate. Its\nalso supposed to be funny, but I can't remember\nlaughing much at all.\nI agree with Xan Brooks, writing in The Big\nIssue. He describes the film as, a glossy, upmarket soap opera - neat enough as it stands but,\nconsidering the quality on offer, nothing really to\nunite home about.' And the ending is a real let\ndown tool\nfilm: the kingdom^ This was definitely the longest film I have seen,\nor am likely to see for a long while. The main reason is that The Kingdom was not designed as a film, but was originally shown on Danish TV as\na sort of mini-series.\nSet in an all-mod-cons hospital, it is a mixture of incompetence and malpractice from the\ndoctors, couple with the paranormal and bizarre,\nstarting form the cries of a child heard in a lift by\nthe hospitals resident hypochondriac and spiritualist. Most reviews therefore describe it as a cross\nbetween the X Files and ER. This is however a rather limited description. Where you had\nMulder and Scully, you have a nonagenarian spiritualist being reluctantly wheeled around by her\nson, a hospital porter who looks like he wants a heart attack. As for the doctors, they all belong\nto a mason type lodge, into which is initiated the\nnew head of neurosurgery, a very gruff Swede.\nHe likes to spend evenings on the roof, praising\nthe beauty of the Swedish nuclear power stations he sees through his binoculars, while cursing the Danes he has inexplicably decided to\nwork for.\nThere are some down side to this film. It is\npretty tiring reading subtitles for over four hours,\nthough you can see the film in two parts. The use\nof hand held camera through out can also\nbecome a little too jerky. And the ICA should\ngive people more leg room. However, overall a heartily recommended film for all those who like\nthe bizarre and are not squeamish, and if anyone\ncan get me a copy of the main theme track I would be eternally grateful!\n\n"

If the use of radioactivity\nis potentially beneficial, how are\nwe to regulate the resulting discharges of very small amounts\ninto the environment?\nPublic concern arises from\nthe current view that the radiation effects are linear down to\nthe smallest dose and can be\nharmful. This must, however, be\nseen in perspective with other\nrisks and with the per cie ved ben-ef its. There are more data on the\neffects of radiation than for any\nother pollutant and this allows\ndischarges to the environment to\nbe strictly regulated. A risk\nassessment for the discharges\nmust be made for the research\nbefore the regulator (HMIP) will\nissue an author is tai on. Each discharge route must be assessed\nindividually.\nThe safest means of disposal\nis storage of solid wastes (tissues,\nglassware etc), contaminated\nwith short-lived activity, to allow\nthe activity to disappear by\ndecay. However for liquid waste,\nthe safest approved disposal\nroute is by the drains since in\nthis way the trace radioactivity is\ndispersed and diluted while it\ndecays. Risk assessments might\nlead typically to an exposed individual receiving less than 1% of\ntheir average annual background\ndose. You might say that this is\nmore than it should be, but do\nyou worry when you travel from\nthe Cotswolds to Aberdeen and\nincrease your radiation dose by\n300%?

We are now to meet up\non a regular basis, and I shall\nendeavour to keep up to date\nwith the state of play of the great\nImperial house extension.\nIt's really hard to know what\nto make of it all: I feel I should-n't say this, but it's quite possible\nthat the Director of Estates is\nactually quite a reasonable man.\nThat doesn't seem to be the current viewpoint of the St Mary's medics. But I can't help feeling\nthat we're rather letting ourselves down, that our 'too little\ntoo late' protestations come over\nas being complaint for the sake\nof it. I wonder if we just sound\nfaintly petulant, and whether the\nincoherent voice of the Imperial\nStudent actually has any credibility at all.\nWe are in serious danger of\nhaving a real shortage of student\nfacilities in a couple of years'\ntime. College wanted to build a sizeable new area of social space\nin the Sherfield Building. It\nwould have had bars, restaurants,\nand meeting rooms, as well as\nshops and welfare offices. Okay,\nso the location wasn't great, but\nquite frankly it would have been\na sizeable improvement on sticking with the decidedly tatty rundown facilities that we have at\npresent. They are already unable\nto cope with the size of the present population, even before we\nhave hoards of beer y medics\ndescending upon us.\nThe unspoken attitude\namongst the College decision\nmakers seems to be that they\ntried, and we rejected it, and\nthat embarrassed them, and so\nwe don't get another chance.\nAlthough that's quite clearly an\nunreasonable attitude, because\nthey, simply couldn't afford the\n'Sherfield option', it really does-n't look likely that ICU will be\nable to expand in Beit Quad. The\nmassive financial undertaking\nthat is the current estates strategy quite simply has to be\nfinanced by revenue from conferences over the summer.\nBedrooms equals cash - something of the order of \u00a32000 per\nyear per bed. So they simply cannot afford to sacrifice bed spaces in Beit Quad for the sake of a larger student bar.

    "content": "Feature Felix Friday 1 9th January 1996 . five\nWhat do you do when you see someone\nhomeless, lying in a doorway? Do you\nlook away? Ignore them. Walk on by.\nWhen you hear them say, \"Spare some\nchange?\" do you listen?\nWhen they beg for money, you give them\nchange, or you don't. It's as simple as that. You do,\nbecause you don't want to feel guilty. Or you don't: they'd only spend it on drink or drugs. Either way,\nyou've walked past and they're forgotten, just another statistic in six hundred thousand.\nI wanted to write this article to tell you about\nsome of these people. So that you might get to know\nthem. And then maybe afford them a little human\ndignity, and the right not to be ignored.\nWe do the \"Soup Run\" twice a week, taking hot\ndrinks, food and blankets to homeless people at\nLincoln's Inn Fields and down the Strand. There are\nregulars we see every week, and other people I 've\nonly met once, but little things about them stick in\nmy mind: a man crossing the Kingsway with a chessboard - taking his move to a friend sleeping on the\nother side of the road; the blok e who told me about\nthe merits of French prisons versus English ones; the\nman who showed me a photograph of the daughter\nhe hadn't seen in five years, saying I looked just like\nher.\nThere's things that make you sad inside: a pregnant woman asking me for an aspirin; a man with\nbronchitis selling the Big Issue in the rain; a little old\nman sniffing glue Irom a dirty plastic bag: when he's high he runs round laughing maniacal ly.I can understand why, though: what else has he got? Sometimes\ndrugs or alcohol are the only escape for many homeless people. I thought this man was about sixty, but\nI 've talked to him when he's been sober, and he said\nhe's only thirty one. That's such ac liche: being homeless ages you. But it's only clich es that come true on\nthe streets.\nThere's a girl we've met several times, sitting in\na doorway on the Strand. She's all alone except for\nher dog, and she looks about fifteen. There's the old\nman outside the post office on the Kingsway. He\nalways seems cheerful and he loves his cups of tea.\nHe looks like someone's grandad: he shouldn't be\nthere, he should be at home, in the warm, with\ngrandchildren around him, not sleeping on wet con-crete, hoping his thermos flask doesn't get nicked.\nThere's people I 've met who make me laugh so\nmuch: Paddy, with his hundred and one jokes with no\npunch lines; George and Chris who took the piss out\nof everybody: their concern for Nathan after his\nlobotomy operation was touching! I 've been threatening to chop off Chris's ponytail for ages, but if I did\nI don't think my hair would\nlast much longer! I hadn't seen Chris since before the\nsummer until I ran into him\na few weeks ago: he was on\nthe other side of a soup run,\nhelping out. He's doing aN V Q now, and seems to\nhave got himself sorted.\nThen there's John, who\nwarned us not to laugh at\nhim when he turned up in a Santa suit. He's got multiple\nsclerosis: the first Santa I 've\nmet on crutches. He was\ncollecting money for Great\nOrmond St. Hospital. We\ndidn't know quite what to\nsay when he gave us money\nfor the soup run.\nEvery week we used to\nsee this old man who slept\ndown by the law courts. He was in the merchant\nnavy during the war and he always kept us talking for\nages about Faraday and magnetic mines. He'd had\nfive or six wives in his time and he proposed to some\nof our volunteers! Once when we saw him, he said it\nwas his 90th birthday - mind you the week after, he\nsaid it was his 91st! He always seemed really frail.\nHe's been moved on now - there's building work\nwhere he used to sleep. I 've no idea what's happened\nto him, and we've never seen him again.\nChris, who organised the soup run last year, but\nonly comes occasionally now, turned up one week\nand was offered a cup of tea by some fresher s who\nthought he was homeless. There's no difference\nbetween people with somewhere to live and people\nwithout: it could be anyone, it could be you, ten years\ndown the line, a failed marriage or an alcohol pro b lem. We meet a City & Guilds man most weeks on\nthe Strand. He's old and deaf, but he knows his\nFourier Transforms.\nNot everyone's appreciative of what we do.\nPeople get fed up of the same cheap sandwiches\ndished out by charities and churches - we've had our\nfood thrown back in our faces and told to fuck off.\nIt's fair enough: people need a home not a cup of tea.\nI 've never felt so powerless in my life as when someone asks me if I know anywhere they can stay\ntonight. All I can say is, the soup run's been the only\ntime anyone has said \"God Bless You\" to me and really meant it.\nIC Community Action Group need volunteers, blankets and minibus drivers for the soup run. Every Tuesday and Thursday,8:15 pm, Weeks Hall: just turn up, or contact c dol be a r@ic by Cathy Dolbear\nEo I "

It could be a film, or a scene from a film (the rape scene in The Accused' is a good\nexample), or maybe just a newspaper story so\nshocking in detail that you can't forget it. Now\nimagine if you could harness all the emotions that\nthis film or story conjured up in you - the fears,\nthe paranoia, the shame, the aggression and the\nfury - and put them to music. Actually, don't. Someone else has already done it for you. They're\ncalled Kom and their debut album is fear's very\nown soundtrack.\nI suppose that this all sounds a little bit melo-dramatic. It probably is, but if you can manage to\nlisten to all of this in one sitting without having to\ntake a break to unscramble your senses then I 'll be\nimpressed. Perhaps things are best summed up by\nthe closing track, 'Daddy'. As with all of Kom's music, the song is structured around a low, rumbling bass sound that never settles and cons e qu end y never allows you to settle. A menacing\ndrum beat and almost dissonant guitars break in,\nfollowed by Jonathan Davis' vocals. Ah yes, those\nvocals. Vocals that make the Sister of Mercy's Andrew Eldritch sound like a castrated wuss.\nVocals that could sing 'Happy Days' and make it\nsound like the theme tune to your worst night-mare. Vocals that are a gon is ed and pained as they\nrip into a detuned, guitar infested chorus that\nspeaks of the unspeakable - child abuse: \"I scream,\nno-one hears me, it hurts, not a lot... Mummy,\nwhy?'\nIt ends with minutes of tormented wails and\nsobbing and you're left feeling numb, helpless and\nwondering if it's all been a bad dream.

Their set was punchy, tight,\nand blessed with a raw edge that has been lacking\nin their singles to date. Those singles, three-minute rants that have charted the progress of a maturing band, were delivered tonight with the\nconviction that belongs to a band who obviously\nbelieve in their own talent. 'It Moved', erm,\nmoved, while new single, Tabulae' was, erm, fab-u lou s(!) Hopefully their debut album, 'Be\nSpecial', will be too...\nIt was soon afterwards that we learned of the\nriot outside and you could feel the tension rise in the crowd. This tension exploded into adulation\nas Therapy? bounded on stage and straight into\n'Epilepsy', the opening track from their last\nalbum, 'Infernal Love'.\nTherapy? are one of the most exciting bands\nat the moment and they didn't disappoint live,\nplaying a well-rounded set consisting of material\nthat ranged from the hauntingly subversive\n'Diane' to the techno-edged tension of\n'Teethgrinder'.\nThe only criticism I do have is that the end of\n'30 Seconds' went on a bit too long - they could\nhave played another song instead! Thankfully they\nremedied things by finishing with the old classics,\n'Potato Junkie' and 'Screamager'. It was a fitting\nend to a fine gig and I left so happy (and knack-ered) that I wasn't even upset when I found\nBrixton tube station closed due to the riot.\nalbum: various artists brit hop and amyl house. \u2122\nThis is a compilation of continuous mix dance\nmusic by a number of artists that includes Bomb\nThe Bass, Renegade Soundwave and, of course,\nThe Chemical Brothers, who have a hand in two\nof the tracks here. The opening track, 'What's That Sound?' and Depth Charge's 'Shoalin\nBuddha Finger' are among the outstanding tracks\nhere while the classic, played to death, 'Leave\nHome' is here for completeness.\nThe compilation was appa rend y meant for\n'all the party people' which sounds like a dubious\nreason for any kind of album. The music mixes\nare pretty interesting although the nature of the\ncompilation means that it lacks the impact that it\nmight have. It's a bit like listening to a top 20 indie\ncompilation.\nSpeaking as someone new to this, it will\nprobably make a good introduction for those\nwhose previous exposure is limited to 'Leave\nHome'. The more discerning listener will probably find all of this rather mundane after a while.

It involves the interaction of the\nvoice with instruments such as the violin and\nmir u than gam. Bharatha Natyam\nThe dance of the Tamils is known as\nBharatha Natyam. The word signifies 'Bha'\nfor Bhavam (expression), 'Ra' for Raga\n(music), 'Tha' for Thalam (rhythm) and\n'Natyam'(Dance). It was originally a temple\ndance and dates back to 2nd Century AD Most of the themes for this dance are\nselected from Hindu mythology.\nDrama - Santhathigal (Generations)\nThis describes a typical Tamil family\nlike thousands of others who have fled their\nhomeland Jafflia, Northern SriLanka since\n1984. They have left behind their\nknowledge, culture, talents, dreams and\ncome to a strange land under the title\n'Refugees'. 'Generations' shows how one\nsuch family has adapted to life in the UK. This drama has proven to be a great success\nand is staged here for the Tamil Society for\nthe sixth time!\nMusic Band - Chitralaya\nA feast of eastern and western\ninstruments will accompany the young and\ntalented Tamil singers in the UK as they sing\nsome of the most popular cinema songs.\nA lot of effort has been put in by our\nmembers to make this event a great success.\nWe hope to send the money raised to\nthe displaced people - especially children\nwho are suffering from lack of medication\nand sanitation in the Northern province of\nSriLanka.

    "content": "News Felix Friday January 1 9th1996. three\nTop-up fees face student opposition\ncontinued from front page\nacademic world through various\nmedia.\nAlthough Imperial College is\nset to be \u00a32 million worse off\nnext year, it is unlikely to charge\ntop-up fees to its home students,\nhaving calculated that it could\nmatch the funding loss by attracting more overseas students.\nHowever, the fact that the\nCollege has done its homework\non this matter suggests that they\nare taking the threat seriously\nand have been looking at the position thoroughly. Also, last year is\nthought to have been a good one\nfor the College, leaving it in a financially strong position this\nyear.\nOthers in the Russell Group\nof universities and colleges have\nnot been quite so lucky, Imperial\nbeing the only one to come out\nstrongly against top-up fees. For\nexample, Manchester will almost\ncertainly have to introduce some\nform of additional funding, much\nto the dismay of its Student's Union. Speaking to Felix, Simon\nWebber, General Secretary of\nManchester SU, outlined their\nopposition to the scheme, saying\nthat they would prefer the university to take fewer students\nnext year, in order to leave some\nslack for the system to take up.\nHe stressed that although this is\nintended to reduce the burden on\nthe student, it would also be necessary to establish an \"equitable\nand fair system of student financial support for, the long term\nfuture\" to meet the challenge,\nand they would be working with\nthe university to achieve this.\nMr Webber stated that a let-Cuts mean job losses say AUT BY DIPAK GH OSHA spokesman for the Association\nof University Teachers has\nlikened the reduction of university funding to to the closure of\nseven major universities or the\nloss of 6,500 lecturers' jobs.\nThe cuts are based on the\ngovernment's assumption that\nuniversities can increase their\nefficiencies, but according to the\nAUT, this was an attempt to\ndeceive the general public and to\ndisguise the scale of the cuts. The\nAUT also condemned the two-pronged push toward private\nfunding of higher education,\nnamely capital for university\ndevelopment and maintenance\nand student loan privatisation, as\na 'double disaster'.\nThe government also\nexpects Universities to recoup\nthe cuts through private funding.\nHowever, the AUT believes that\nthe cuts are so severe - over 50%\nin the next three years - that this\nwould be impossible. It also\nbelieves that a private company\nrun in this fashion would quickly\ngo bankrupt.\nThe funding cuts are widely\nexpected to lead to lecturer\nredundancies and pay freezes.\nHowever, lecturer's unions,\nincluding the AUT, say they have\nlittle choice but to push for \"sub-st anti al\" pay increases, in order\nto reduce the growing pay difference between their members and\nthose in comparable jobs.\nTom Wilson, assistant general secretary of the AUT, said: \"If\nthis, or some other token of\ngoodwill, is not forthcoming then\nwe will not take it lying down.\"\nter had been drafted, to be sent\nto the Committee of ViceChancellors and Principals\n(CVCP) in time for their next\nmeeting, and that he hoped it\nwould be signed by the\nPresidents of all the SUs in the\nRussell Group. The letter sets\nout the student's objections to\ntop-up fees, pointing out that\nthere have been few issues which\nhave united Student Unions to\nsuch a great extent, which\ndemonstrated its importance to\nthose in higher education. This\nmove is unrelated to that of\nDurham's SU; Manchester,\nalthough supportive, prefers to\nencourage the lobby of the\nCVC P, seen as the only body\nwhich might persuade universities not to introduce top-up fees\nand thus escape the corner into\nwhich the Government has painted them.\nSarah White was uncertain\nof the action day's possible\nimpact, commenting that it was\n\"not really our style.\" However,\nshe did emphasise ICU's strong\nopposition to top-up fees, and\nagreed that something really\nought to be done about it.\nThieves in computer centre\nBY MARK BRIDGE\nThe new year started badly\nfor Mech Eng when thieves broke\nin on the 12th and helped themselves to valuable computer com-pon ents. The thieves systematically removed chips from\nmachines in the Workstation\nSystems Room on the fourth\nfloor Computer Centre at about\n6pm. The stolen parts have been\nvalued at around \u00a35000.\nThe Deputy Head of the\nComputer Centre, Arthur\nSpirling, said that the main targets were memory chips. These\nare compact and can cost up to\n\u00a3100 per Mb chip, making them\nextremely attractive to thieves.\nAn SGI-1 type and three other\nIris type machines were dam-aged. The SGI was polled at 6:05\nbut failed to reply, timing the\nincident around then (machines\nare polled at intervals of just\nunder five minutes). The processors were also removed along\nwith the boards in some\nmachines. The large L shaped\nroom was occupied by one worker at the time.\nKenneth Weir, Deputy Head\nof Security, said that the perpetrators entered and left through\nthe room's fire escape door. Mr.\nWeir said that Closed Circuit\nTelevision does not cover the\narea at the moment and so other\navenues of investigation are in the\ninitial stages of being pursuit.\nThe SGIs may have been targeted because they have more\nmemory than PC's. Additionally,\nthe PC rooms are more likely to\nbe occupied during the evening.\nSecurity Success in\nSouthside\nYesterday lunchtime an intruder was discovered in Southside\nhalls. An Asian man in his\ntwenties was seen by a number\nof students, who discovered\nsoon afterwards that one of\ntheir stereo systems was miss-ing.\nThey quickly notified college security, who found the\nman in another part of the\nhalls. As Felix went to press,\npolice were on site and the\nstereo system, found in a nearby bathroom, was waiting to be\nfingerprinted.\ncontinued from front page\nunderstanding\" why students are\ncomplaining so much now, insisting that the provision for student\nspace was agreed with ICU during the summer of 1995. He\nmaintains that the project is still\non schedule.\nPlanning permission will be\nconsidered at a Kensington and\nChelsea Borough meeting later\nthis month. College say they are\nconfident that there will be no\nproblems with their application\nfor demolition of the old chemistry building.\nThe medics have had considerable success raising awareness\nabout their concerns with staff at\nSt Mary's, as well as among alumni of the school and the governors\nof Imperial College, and they\ninsist that this will strengthen\ntheir cause.\n\n"

    "content": "Feature Felix Friday 1 9th January 1996 . seven\nCruelty or Progress?\nFelix examines the vivisection debate and wonders if either side knows what they' re talking about. The animal experiments versus anti-vivisection debate is as hot as ever.\nSince it became a major issue in\nthe 1980s the lack of coherent communication between the two sides has meant that\nthe ethical issues at the heart of the\nproblem still have not been addressed in\na clear-headed and useful way.\nScientists are often accused of being bad\ncommunicators in whatever field their\nresearch lies, but when this is compounded\nby a \"siege mentality\" brought on by threats\nand abuse from the anti-vivisection lobby\nthey tend to clam up altogether\nScientists involved in anim a research in labs which have been\nbombed or threatened are often\nunwilling or too frightened to\nspeak about their research and\nwhy they feel that it is necessary.\nOn the other side of the fence\nthere is a very vocal anti-viv is ec tion lobby many of whose more\northodox members think that all\nanimal research is harmful, pain fu and unnecessary. Their argument can\nbe very emotional with hard-hitting pictures\nwhich are shown to the public, while all that\nthe science community can respond with are\ndry research papers.\nThis polaris es the debate and is a self-perpetuating situation. Those opposed to animal testing often don't understand its\nmotives or aims and all too often the scientists' response is to retreat from the public\nscene. This is a very unsatisfactory position and it has led to a situation in\nwhich the general public do not /;';'\"\nunderstand why animal testing\nshould take place.\nThis is not an in surmount able problem, it is merely a lack\nof communication. The self-reinforcing cycle of mis- s'y trust can be bro-ken. The easiest way to begin to do this is probably for the\nscience community to become more open,\nand to spend more time and resources making its objectives clear. This would make a wider and more open debate possible and\nC^ thus there are grounds\nfor hoping that the\ncurrent polarisation will\nnot persist indefinitely and that this particular problem can be resolved.\nBeyond the problem of communication there exists the deeper problem of\nthe actual ethical issue, the debate over\nnecessity and benefits versus hardship.\nHere one frequently hears the charge\nthat scientists care only about their\nwork and don't spare any consideration for the animals involved. To help\ndispel this it has been suggested that future\nscientific papers relating to the subject\nshould contain a section on any adverse\neffects of certain techniques on the\nanimals thus helping future\nresearchers to avoid the same\nmistakes. Additionally, there r x is an increasing awareness\nthat the conditions in which\nanimals are kept is also\nimportant. Many scientists /\nhave pointed out that con- /\nditions in labs are significantly better than in some j livestock farms, and point to A the all-too-frequent cases of\nabuse of animals kept as pets.\nHaving said that, there is increasing evidence that for animals psychological and\nphysical well-being it is better that they are\nkept in groups and not confined to a solitary\nexistence.\nWith regard to the experiments\nthemselves, in some\ncases alternatives may be\nused, but\nx where no\nalternatives\n^ \\ S> exist then given that\nobtaining a particular piece\nof knowledge requires animal testing it reduces to a question of how\nnecessary is the research in question. This can\nbe a very subjective matter; 'the necessity of\nthe research is in the mind of the experimenter.' It can sometimes be argued that research\nwill lead to a cure for a particular disease or\nthat it is necessary to test the toxicity of a certain material, but it is often the nature of\nscience that no such obvious or immediate\npay-back exists. Indeed, it is not possible to do \"good science\" if one is\nonly pursuing limited short-term\ngoals in which science is reduced to\nthe level of being just another\nform of investment. Often\nresearch is in pursuit of a more fundamental or general understanding\nwhich can be controversial\nenough when it consumes tax\npayers' money but when it involves\nanimals, explaining the necessity of such\nresearch becomes a more complicated issue.\nResearch with animals is on a different ethical level from other areas of science.\nOn a par with the difficulty of assessing\nf\\ the necessity of the research is the\n/ I difficulty of measuring the amount of\n: X/ pain inflicted on the animal, and yet\nthis is obviously very important in\nany discussion of benefits ver*g fc| gH\u00bb sus hardship. There are no\nobjective criteria by which to\ndo this; merely an thro po morph ising the animal doesn't help, since what\nJ may make a human struggle and\nscream may render another animal\nmotionless, as a natural tendency to hide\nstress and pain as a defence against predators.\nThere can be no strict formula, there-fore, for determining whether or not a specific piece of research is justified and the best\nthat we can probably do is to develop a technique to give both sides of the\nargument a fair hearing and then\nreach some kind of consensus.\nThis will appear to be a very\nunsatisfactory solution to many\nnot least because it leaves the\nissue open, but it would be a significant step towards an improve-ment. The current polarised situation must not be allowed to per-s is t, not only since it is damaging to science\nbut also because its emotional, confrontational nature frequently turns the issue into a shouting match and therefore leaves it una d dressed.\n\n"
