    "content": "FEATURE 1 7 October 1997\nA II dressed ii p and S nowhere togo ICS WALKERS MAY HAVE\nPUT A FOOT IN IT BUT\nTHE FELLWANDERS KEEP\nON TRIPPING...\nIn June, nine Fellwanderers set off\non what proved to be our most\nexciting trip to date, for reasons\nwhich were not wholly anticipated.\nAt the end of term we all jetted off\nto Southern France for a fortnight\nof trekking and camping in the\nrugged Pyrenees, attempting to\nfollow some of the GRIO long-dis-t ance path.\nThe first week was warm and\nsunny, and started with an arduous\nclimb up to 7,500ft, leaving civilisation behind completely. We\nwalked for hours under clear blue\nskies through alpine meadows,\npast clear blue lakes, and over\nboulder-strewn wastes, where\nsnow still lay in patches. Our\nWilderness Campsite under the Pic\nde Bastan afforded particularly\nmemorable views.\nAfter a few days, we transferred to Gavarnie, the starting\npoint for the next major section of\nour trek. We spent a couple of\ndays here, admiring the magnificent Cirque de Gavarnie, a vast\nnatural amphitheatre bounded by\nsheer rock faces4,500 ft high.\nMeltwater from glaciers forms the\nGrande Cascade, one of Europe's highest\nwaterfalls, which we discovered was rather wet at close quarters. By Saturday the weather was\nbeginning to deteriorate, with the\nwind getting up and the temperature dropping. We decided to get\non the move again, heading up\ninto the mountains towards\nVignemale. On the way we\nencountered desolate valleys with\neagles circling around, no\ndoubt eyeing up the marmots.\nDuring the afternoon however,\nof improving, and it began to look\nas if we may be holed up there for\nsome time. But the lack of heating\nand the trips through the snow to\nthe refuge's single outside toilet\ndid little to lower our morale, and\ndwindling food supplies did not\nthings started to deviate somewhat from our plans. As we\nclimbed higher, the drizzle turned\nto rain, which turned to snow,\nwhich turned to lots of snow,\nabout two feet of it by the end of\nthe day. But we pressed on hero-ic ally, still wearing our shorts, as\nwe are no strangers to these con-ditions. (They were just a little\nunexpected in the South of France\nat the end of June, that's all.) The\nwarden at the mountain refuge we\ncame to was more than slightly\nsurprised to see us arrive thus\nattired, and did not turn out to be\nthe hospitable host we had been\nhoping for. But after a little ne got i ation, he did actually let us stay in\nthe refuge rather than in some\nnearby caves. The Z0 or so other\nguests didn't seem to mind too\nmuch, and one of them even\ntranslated the warden's jokes\nabout us.\nThe weather showed no signs\nstop us making a fine lentil stew on\nthe second night.\nBy Monday morning, the warden had been in radio contact with\nthe local authorities, who had\ndecided that the seriousness of\nour situation was enough to warrant a full-scale airlift. He was apparently\nnot slow to spot the opportunity\nfor publicity: the rescue helicopter\nbrought up several journalists and\nTV crews during the evacuation.\n'Des Anglais en shorts' was obviously a major news event, and was\nfeatured on the main national TV\nnews that evening. Various mem-be rs' legs achieved their 15 seconds of fame while Oily proudly\nexplained that such clothing was\n'normal en Angleterre'. Our free\nhelicopter ride was most definitely\na highlight of the trip, and took us\nover some very impressive snow-capped scenery.\nIn the second week, we could\nnot hope to match this for excite-ment, especially as it turned out to\nbe the wettest week since the\nFrench Revolution. As the rain beat\ndown\non our tents, the thermal baths\nat Cauterets began to sound more\nand more appealing. However, we\ndecided to give them a wide berth\nwhen we discovered that you\nneeded a prescription to get in.\nHaving thus exhausted the town's potential for entertainment, we\nheaded up the river to Pont\nd 'Espagne, where the waterfalls\nwere made all the more impressive\nby the downpours. From here,\nsome of us attempted a quick\nexcursion over the mountains into\nSpain. But at the first sight of a snowflake we turned tail and fled;\nwe may be mad but we're not\nstupid.\nThe next day we returned to\nCauterets where we made a sumptuous 19-course meal to celebrate\nour survival. Then it was back to\nLondon, home, dry and thoroughly\nexhausted. If you would like a piece of the action, come along to\none of our regular lunchtime meetings (see diary).\nJames Clarke\nja.clarke@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 17 October 1997\nYes, Mr President.\nThe race is on for the presidency\nof Imperial College Union. As Felix\nwas going to print, only one candidate had signed up. Voting takes\nplace on the 1 1 th of November and\nMark Baker (Computing 4) is currently the only candidate for the\njob. The other vacant post, Deputy\nPresident for Clubs and Societies,\nappears to have no candidates\nstanding as yet.\nLike most student unions, ICU\nis run by sabbaticals or 's a bbs', elected annually, who have either\nfinished their degrees or have taken\na year out from their studies. ICU\nhas four s a bbs: President, Deputy\nPresident for Clubs and Societies,\nDeputy President for Finance and\nServices, and Felix Editor. Members\nof ICU (any student with a union\ncard) are eligible to vote. Normally\nvoting takes place in March and the\ns a bbs elect enter office, learning\ntheir jobs from the previous incumbents in a hand-over period over\nthe summer.\nHowever 1CU began this year\nwith only two s a bbs instead of\nusual four. The first round of elections, held in Spring 1996, saw two\ncandidates stand, one of whom\nwithdrew before voting took place -the remaining candidate was\ndefeated by New Election. A fresh\nround of elections was organised in\nMay, which drew three candidates.\nOnce again, two of them withdrew\nand the remaining one was defeated by New Election. The final\nround, held in July, saw four candidates stand - one was to withdraw\n- but many were surprised at yet\nanother victory for New Election,\ngiven the quality of the candidates\nthat were standing (See Felix Ed.\n1092).\nThe candidate for the presidency seemed optimistic. \"I think my\nprospects are good,\" Mr Baker\nsaid. \"1 like to think I'm a serious\nand competent candidate who can\ndo the job.\" On the one-horse-race\nin prospect, Mr Baker said that \"it\nwould be quite worrying if no-one\nelse wanted to do the job as it\nwould mean that there was something tragically wrong with the\nunion,\" though he commented, \"I'm quite happy for it to be just me.\"\nTalking to Felix, the ICU\nPresident Eric Allsop said, \"1 hope\nthere's more than one candidate\nfor the presidency to make it into a race.\" He seemed unconcerned\nthat there would be a repeat of\nwhat happened in previous round\nof voting. 'You have to look at how\nand why it happened,\" he said, saying that this time round the circumstances were rather different. He\nadded that in spring 1996, poor\ncandidates had stood, and that\nbetter candidates who had stood\nlater had been undone by a \"band-wagon\" effect of people voting for\nNew Election. The voting system,\ntogether with the medics' block\nvote, had also \"conspired against\nus, by Mary's students failing to\nexpress a second preference,\"\nspecifically citing the case of final\nround of votes held in July.\nAs regards the new round of\nelections, he said, \"We have at least\none good candidate...four people\nexpressed an interest - only one of\nthem serious... there's likely to be a random fresher who'll want to get\ntheir name known on campus.\"\nIf all goes to plan, a new president will be elected on the 11 th of\nNovember, after which Mr Allsop\nwill conduct a shortened hand-over\nbefore returning to his research.\n\"I'm looking forward to getting back\nto my PhD,\" he said.\nHe said that an incoming president faced many challenges.\n\"Certain problems need solutions\nexpeditiously,\" he said, citing the\nmedical merger, improving student\nfacilities and the redevelopment of\nBeit Quad after the moving of the\nBiology department.\nAndy Sinharay\nDo you have a license for that Union?\nThe Union's success in securing a Public Entertainment License has\nbeen clouded by aspects of\nunforeseen Health and Safety\nlegislation. Union Stewards must\nnow enforce capacity limits on individual rooms, as well as the total\nlimit on the whole Union building,\nto keep in line with new license reg-ul at ions. Last year, the Union had to\napply for an extension on each\nWednesday and Friday night on a fortnightly basis. This\nled to uncertainty and,\nas may be recalled,\nresulted in midnight\nbar-closing on several\noccasions due to\nlicense refusal last\nterm.\nHaving obtained\nthe PE License to\nensure regulated and\nguaranteed late night\nopening on Ents\nnights, the Union is\nnow having to face a new problem of\ncapacity restrictions\nimposed by the Police and\nLicensing Authority. Flow in and out\nof dB's and Union bars must now be\nregulated on Ents nights to abide\nwith the new conditions. This has\ncaused an absurd situation, experienced first-hand by many at last\nweek's Fresher's Carnival. As the\nhallways, foyer and staircases are\nexempt from the room limits, they\nare used as overflow areas for people who are not allowed to enter full\nrooms. At the Carnival, this led to\novercrowding in those areas and\nmain routes to fire escapes were\nblocked off due to sheer numbers,\na situation that seems to have been\noverlooked by the council.\nThe Union Bar running at 'maximum capacity'\non Monday... Photo: Lili\nSomewhat ironically on ordinary\nnights the room restrictions do not\napply and any number of people\nmay crowd into the Union Bar.\nIn a sense, the Union has been\na victim of its own success. Three Home (Events and Marketing\nyears ago Union events were Manager) commented that \" we've\nsparsely attended but in the last always aimed for a safe en v iron eighteen months only three Ents ment and the license has now done\nthat\". Although it has\nalways been the\nUnion's policy to act\nresponsibly, providing free tap water, the\nchill-out room, first\naid ers and a safe ratio\nof Union stewards to\nrevellers, they are\nnow legally obliged to\ndo so.\nIn the short term,\nas a partial solution,\nFelix has just disco v... and the result; many party-goers forced to ered that are pre sen stay in the less than salubrious lobby. Photo: Lili tat ive of the Licensing\nAuthorities paid a visit\nnights have not sold out. The Union\nsought the license to enable it to\nprovide a reliable service for its\never growing \"clientele\" but in\ndoing so further restricted the\nnumbers able to benefit - one hundred less tickets were available for\nthe recent Carnival. This highlights\nthe need for space in the Union\nwhich is currently being addressed\nby Eric Allsop (President of ICU).\nThe positive implications of the\nlicense are that the Union must be\na safe place on Ents nights. Mark\nto the Union on Wednesday and\nadvised that Da Vincis and the\nUnion Bar could be considered as\none room with a combined capacity of 300 thus allowing more than\n50 people into the Union Bar.\nMahlina and Joesia\n\n"

Their\nfirst film; Soft Top, Hard Shoulder\nwas released in 1993 and won two\nScottish Baftas.\nJez (Stuart Townsend) and\nDylan (Dan Futterman, last seen in\nThe Birdcage) are two affable,\ntwenty-something overqualified\nand underemployed orphans.\nDylan is a fast talking Yank who\nalways says the right thing at the\nright time but who cannot get a job\nsince he is chronically dyslexic. Jez\nis a tongue-tied techno-nerd with\na lousy haircut. They have one\nshared dream; to own a stately\nhome.\nAfter launching a business selling fake voice-recognition systems\nto multi-national companies they\nmeet Georgie (Kate Beckinsale).\nUnknown to them, she is trying to\nsave her family estate which has\nbeen converted into a centre for\nDowns Syndrome children, one of\nwhom is her younger brother. In\norder to do this she is marrying a Kate Beckinsale plays the\napparently sweet Georgie\nrich twit whom she doesn't love\nbut who has agreed to put up the\nmoney to stop the sale.\nEverything is going swimming ly as j ez and Georgie appear to be\nfalling for each other when it all\nsuddenly goes wrong. During a scam the boys are recognised by\none of their previous victims and\nimprisoned for three months.\nIf you walked out of the film\nnow then you would leave believing\nthat you were watching one of the\nbest British films ever, but it is not\nto be. From that point on things\nstart to get silly. Whilst inside it is\nannounced that the day before\nthey get out fifty pound notes will\nno longer be legal tender and, in a cruel twist of fate, all their money\njust happens to be in fifties. Aided\nby Georgie they hatch an elaborate\nplot to get out...\nThis had so much potential.\nWith a brilliant endearing cast and\na great 'BritPop' soundtrack\n(Space, The Wannadies, Divine\nComedy, The Bluetones, Dubstar\nfor starters) it was on track to be\none of my favourite films ever\nbefore the ending which just ruins\neverything. 1 won't give it away\nbut it reduces the film to the level\nof the usual Hollywood output. Go\nand see it for the first 3/4 of the\nfilm and just hope that the producers suddenly have a change of\nheart and re film the finale before\nits general release.

' , ' .\nlowed by Luscious Jackson pro duc Here. Artists from both sides of the\nAtlantic are brought together as\nwell as artists from different generations. Bobby Darin's Beyond The\nSea. full of brass band pomposity\nsits snugly in with Underworld's songs on here, including golden\noldies like Elvis Presley's Always On\nroma ce). The pin a cle of the album\nhas to be Faithless' gospel sounding Where Has A// The Love Cone.\n;\".v \u2022 ; ,. . \u2022 \u2022 ' ; >\n\u2022\n.\n-; ,.\nListening to the soundtrack\nof a film that you have not\nseen is always an interesting experience. The songs that a director chooses to complement\na film are vitally important to the\ndynamics and feel.\nSeveral different approaches\nwill often work for one scene, but\nchoosing the best one is difficult\nat the best of times and so it is\nquite difficult to criticise any individual songs because they may\nhave been the best songs for the\npart of the film in which they were\nused. With Face, Antonia Bird has\ncome up with a film about a heist\ngone wrong that is set in the heart\nof London's gangland community.\nThe songs on this soundtrack,\nthen, should reflect that atmosphere and social condition.\nFortunately, they do.\nWe start with Paul Weller\nand his acoustic guitar which is\nfollowed, rather surprisingly, by\na sub-jungle track from Alex\nReece with Deborah Anderson\non vocals. This is fairly representative of most of the album\nwhere house and dance go\nhead-to-head with acoustic ballads and guitar-driven cuts. A fairly wide range of music is,\ntherefore, covered and this\nmakes for a good general compilation album. There's also a good selection of names on the\nalbum; Fluke, The Longpigs,\nGene, Billy Bragg and Death In\nVegas all contribute. The\nstrangest thing, perhaps, is that\nthis film about London and a soundtrack that reeks of London\nthrough and through ends on a song by Puressence, a very\nnorthern band. H Alok\nSINGLES\nSmog - Ex - Con\n1 know it is probably sacrilege to utter any bad\nwords against Smog, the regular fave s of a certain music newspaper, but I'm sorry, this is\nbland, boring and tiresome.\nPrimal Scream - Burning Wheel\nKowalski has the hard edged immediate impact\neffect that expresses the Scream's pioneering\nattitude. Burning Wheel instead drifts you along\ninto an ethereal atmospheric bass heavy zone\nand is undoubtedly the number one track off\nVanishing Point.\nHurricane #1 - Step Into My World The\nPerfecto Mixes\nThe amazing debut single from Andy Bell's new\npost Ride outfit has been masterfully remixed.\nDon't think they're ripping you off by releasing\nit again after just a few months. It totally\ndeserves to be.\n2K***k the Millenium\nWhat Time Is Love was originally recorded in\n1988 and has now been remixed to produce a real kick arse track, appropriately released just\ndays after the start of the construction for the\nmillenium dome.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Violet - Sleepwwalking\nDepressing lyrics, meaningful lyrics. Combining\nthe sounds and style of Suede and Puressence,\nwhile at the same time coming across as\nunique. Managing to pull it off and still include a brilliant Radiohead - esque ending to crown it all\noff. You may leap to conclusions about jumping\nonto the bandwagon of the 'new grave' scene\njust as I did. However I would forgive them this\ntime because it is a cracking track.\nImogen Heap - Getting Scared\nIt seems as though Beth Orton has a fan, it was\nonly a matter of time I suppose. This track is\nawash with emotional vocals and oppressive\nbeats, a sure sign that Imogen is from the Beth\nOrton stable of singer-songwriters. Listenable\nbut nothing special.\nThe Cure - Wrong Number\nIt sounds uncannily similar to any of Jesus Jones'\ntracks, with its dance beats under laying the guitar melody approach. However they have the\nlyrics close to home, with lines like, 'I'm green\nand tangerine'. Who else would write that I ask\nyou?\nMover - Move Over\nHaven't we been inundated enough with Beatles\nwannabes. Well if you're not already sick of\nthem all by now, here is another band who have\nwr ii ten a drab, unoriginal pile of Cast type\ngarbage, d Jason\n\n"

The keeper on duty was the\nreserve choice.\nThe game started, with a sudden UCL attack, which was repulsed\nwith a little less than adequate efficiency. A sustained period of pressure by UCL followed, which resulted in a goal as IC struggled to get to\ngrips with the new players and playing together for the first time.\nA spell of good IC play now followed with players going close several times. Special mention must\ngo to Shaggy, who after rounding\nthe keeper managed to find the side\nnetting. Despite this pressure, IC\ncouldn't slot the ball into the net.\nTowards the end of the first half\nUCL mounted a sudden attack and\naided by some lucky moves and\nbounces of the ball managed to fire\nanother goal.\nAfter a solid team talk by our\ncaptain Rick 'Lightweight'\nSetchfield, IC took the field with a renewed sense of verve and vigour.\nFor most of this half we were on\ntop, but only managed to find the\nnet once.\nDespite a tremendous effort,\nwe lost the opening game. One\ncan only speculate what the result\nwould have been if the first choice\nkeeper had turned up and proper\nreferees had been present.\nUCL II 2 I ICHC II\nTop of the Fencing\nCongratulations to Mo Mansoori and Eddie Rysdale who, because of\ntheir performance last year, were chosen to represent Imperial in the\nBUSA fencing team who went on a succesful trip to Saudi Arabia over\nthe summer holidays.\nA reminder to everyone else that there will be a free coaching session at\nlunchtime (12-2) today in Beit Quad, to start the season.\nAll are welcome. For any info mail pas m@ doc.ic.ac.uk.\nKeegan Caught\nICFC III v CHARRING CROSS\nNo coach turned up, so we had to\nmake our way to leafy Surrey to\nface the might of Charing Cross.\nVigorous precipitation didn't help\nthings as we found ourselves about\nto play UMDS - ten minutes later\nwe found the proper pitches, thoroughly soaked (us and them).\nOur new, untested team's apprehension was realised in the\nfirst half when we played shit.\nDefensive misunderstandings let\nthem go one up as their strikers\none-two ed their way down the\nwings and through the middle and\nmade us look merely mortal.\nSomehow we put a pass or two\ntogether in spite of this humiliation,\nand soon John was on hand to slot\nin our equal is er.A third for them\nwas on the cards until Lee's astuteness on the sideline spotted blatant offside in our favour. Their ref,\nwho had been consistently bad)\nduring the game, capitulated under\nour protests, so we went in at half\ntime 2-1 down.\nCOMPETITIONS\nThen the fun began. Miles took\nover as ref for the second half, and\nmiraculously decisions began to go\nour way. That was the turning\npoint. Within two minutes, two\ngoals put us in command as the\ngloves came off and IC turned on\nthe style. Pistol Pete found his feet\nas he cut inside from the left and\nslotted the ball between the post\nand the pretty incompetent keep-er. Within a minute we struck\nagain. Miles (the ref) claimed an\nassist just before James hit the ball,\nand the message, home. Charing\nCross stared in admiration as the\nThirds played more triangles than\nMike Oldfield. Andy's sterling midfield work paid off as he slammed\nthe ball into the roof of the net to\nclaim our fourth. Our defence on\nthe left was non-existent thanks to\nLee adopting a left-back-cum-st rik er role, but who cares? Andy Bellis'\nshot from six yards out was\nblocked by a defender's face, but a simple volley from Pistol on the\nrebound sealed the victory.\nAND we met Kevin Keegan on\nthe Tube on the way back.\nICFC III 5-2 Charing Cross\n25 Wok sets to be won\nWhen you're living away from\nhome, cooking for yourself and\nyour housemates can be a bit of\na chore - if you want to steer\nclear of baked beans on toast\nand tuna and sweet corn pasta,\nthat is!\nNew Zealand Lamb have come\nup with a glossy booklet which\nshows you how to cook delicious and simple recipes in no\ntime at all - in fact they all take\nfifteen minutes or less to\nprepare.\nStir-Fried Lamb with Red\nPeppers is a really versatile dish\nwhich you can cook in a wok or\na frying pan.

    "content": "17 October 1997 COLUMNS\nAfter the semi-organised chaos of\nfresher s' week, life at IC has\nreturned to normal, with the\nresumption of furrow ploughing.\nThe new students are finding their\nfeet (some are even finding their\nlectures) and the BMS comes closer to infestation by medics. This is\nbeginning to look like a very nice\nbuilding and is a credit to Schal.\nWeVe had our differences in the\npast, but I must say they're doing a rather good job. Thanks must\nagain to Phil Hilton for letting me\nhave a peek at the site. To show\nthat the year really has started,\nSherfield has begun haemorrhaging cash at a rate that the board of\nBritish Leyland could only dream\nof in the 1970s. This week, the villain of the peace is the Conference\nOffice.\nMany of you will be aware that\nwe hosted part of The London\nFashion Week recently, which a huge marquee and some seriously\nwell appointed females. As the\nevent has grown, the Natural\nHistory Museum has become too\nsmall, leaving Queen's Lawn the\nonly suitable area around here.\nMarvellous, you say. Great chance\nto make a few quid. Big event like\nthat has enormous scope for\ncharging through\nthe nose,\nenabling the\nCollege to do\nvery well.\n\u00a320,000, maybe\n\u00a330,000? Oh\ndear. Imperial\nCollege didn't even break even.\nNow I'm no\nexpert, but I would have thought that it is\nimpossible to mess up such a golden opportunity as badly as\nAnnette De Lima and her staff did\nin this case. Suggestions that no\nadditional security was costed in\nthe estimate are incredible, even\nby the standards of this depart-ment. Over the summer, conferencing also landed themselves in a situation where rooms in\nSouthside were being let to a language school at a discount (\u00a310\nrather than\n\u00a326.50), which\nwere subsequently sub-let\nat a profit under\nthe name of\n'Imperial Tours.'\nKnowing how\nconcerned Prof\nWakeham, the\ndeputy rector,\nwas said to be\nover the PG Tips\nCt\" adverts of late,\nI'm sure his opinion was sought on\nthis issue... Other stories abound\nabout highly dubious practices as\nyet unproven, but repeated by a wide range of people, and something tells me that this is not the\nlast time this office will come\nunder scrutiny. Anyone\nwho read IC Reporter will\nnot recognise this tale of woe.\nDistorter said, Growing business\nand increasing facilities have led to\nrapid expansion and refurbishment\nof the Conference Office.' Quite\nfrankly, if this is the result of 'grow-ing business1, the best plan would\nseem to be to close the\nConference Office down. The staff\nare clearly out of their depth, with\nthe result that they divert money\nfrom teaching and research rather\nthan boost these 'core activities.' It\nis particularly galling that someone\nsees fit to refurbish their office at a time when some departments, not\nleast my own, are forced to make\nvery tough decisions about funding\nessential services. This is a strikingly powerful example of the ivory\ntower mentality and complete lack\nof accountability that pervades\nSherfield.\nQM LJ d ter Courgette and Rice Remoulade\nThis is a very simple dish which requires\nthe following ingredients:\n*\" A large courgette.\n\u00ab\u2022 A small glass of rice - basmati rice\ngives a lovely fragrance and can be\nbought very cheaply in 20kg bags from\nthe EastyWest Indian shops that line\nmost of the street markets described in\nthe first glorious Burning Water article.\nHaggle and you should be able to get\none for \u00a316. Added bonus: you won't need to go hungry for the rest of the\nyear.\n*\u2022 2 cloves of garlic, crushed and\nchopped as usual.\n*\" Salt, pepper, oil and some chilli\nsauce.\nFirst of all, wash and dry the cour-get te. Then grate it with a cheese grater\n(unless you happen to be the only person to possess a courgette grater).\nSprinkle the result with a generous pinch\nof salt and leave.\nNow cook the rice. There are lots of\nways to do this but mine is the best\n(sorry but it happens to be true).\nGet a hold of a heavy pan with a tight fitting lid. If someone's gone and\nlost the lid use a plate. Slowly melt some\n(say a heaped teaspoonful) butter in the\npan. Pour the glassful of rice in and give\nit a stir. Leave the pan over the heat and\ngently heat the rice up, stir now and\nthen. When the rice has become translucent and smelly, pour two glassfuls of\ncold water into the pan followed by a small pinch of salt, bung the lid on and\nturn the heat up to max. When the water\nstarts boiling, turn the heat right down to\nminimum or even lower if your cooker's a bit ancient and can do this sort of thing\n(people living in a Tony Christian property for instance). After about 10 minutes\nthe rice will have absorbed all the water.\nAt this point turn the heat off and leave\nthe rice to stand for another 10 minutes\nwhile you get on with the courgette.\nPlonk your courgette shreds into a sieve or colander, rinse them under the\ntap and then squeeze as much liquid out\nof them as possible. Heat up some oil\n(olive, 4-5 tablespoons of) over maximum heat until it's smoking. Throw in\nthe garlic, give it a whirl and then add\nthe courgette. Stir energetically. It will\nstick a bit but that doesn't really matter,\nYou don't want it to fry, just to heat\nthrough. At some point add the pepper.\nThe mixture is cooked after 2-3 minutes.\nNow add a few drops of chilli sauce\n(yes, of course it's optional) and maybe\nsome grated parmesan if you have some\nlying around, give a final stir and serve\nwith the rice which by this time will be\nperfect.\nThis dish won't be spoiled if you\ndecide to add a few other vegetables\nlike red/green pepper, onion, sweet corn etc. They go in with the courgette and\nadd a pleasant crunch in ess to the affair.\nFinally, I'd recommend a good bottle\nof bitter to go with this.\nAntione\n^Fr\n~+\n\n"

The Good\nSamaritan is alive and well and living in the body of these two third\nyears, who are possibly called Ben\nand something beginning with an\n'M'.1 owe them the price of a bus\nfare, a great deal of patience and\none of Esther Rantzen's gold heart\nfrom front page\nit reminded her of a \"party atmosphere.\" The shows were scheduled to\ntake place in the daytime between\n9:00am and 6:00pm but were regularly delayed by half an hour. At\ntimes, the noise disturbance would\nhave been taking place until\n6:45pm in the evening causing\nmore disturbances to those living in\nand around the vicinity of the\nCollege.\nMr Gillett said that \"it was hard\nto establish an acceptable sound\nlevel because it depended on a number of factors including the\nlength of the music and its loathsomeness to the ear\".\nProblems were as lo encountered in the organisation of the\nthings. 1 believe I didn't thank them\nat the time, but my heart brims\nwith gratitude now, as I'm sure had\nthey not been so persuasive I'd still be collapsed in a heap on\nQueensgate. I should also like to\nthank Smita who put me on the\nminibus, which I then promptly got\nout of, in the belief that the Union\nwould not appreciate it if I sick in\ntheir vehicle (Neither 1 imagine\nwould my fellow travellers).

Although the deal was struck\nover a year ago, the actual planning\nof the event did not take place until\nthe last minute. The security dept\nwere only notified about the event\nthree weeks before it was staged,\nnot giving them enough time to re-roster their staff adding extra problems and cost to the overall show.\nThe total bill charged by College\nis estimated to be around \u00a326,700,\nthough many additional costs were\nnot accounted for. If the show\ntakes place again next year,\nLondon Fashion Week may have to\npay several times more than this\nyear's bill.\nJiten Patel &.

A company\nthat gives you a real job -making decisions, solving\nproblems, playing an active role?\nThen read on...\nThe next four pages are intended\nto let you have an insight into\nUnilever plus some extra\ninformation about the technical\nside of the business. Unilever is\nlooking for tomorrow's business\nleaders - so some extra information\nto help you on your way could be\nuseful...\nFirstly - in order to be one of\ntomorrow's business leaders, you\nneed to be recruited. Unilever\nemploys a wide range of graduates\nonto the \" UC MDS\" training\nprogramme. To join Unilever in\nthis way there are a number of\nprocesses that you need to go\nthrough - they are carefully\ndesigned to assess your abilities\nand potential and to ensure that\nUnilever can fu fil your needs and\nambitions.\nIt all starts with\nthe application\nJ form - I know it is\nlong - but Unilever\ndoes need to know\nas much about you as possible and\nthe impression you make is\nimportant. It needs to stand out\namong the 3000 applications\nreceived every year. (Plus it is a great starting point to develop any\nother applications forms).\nAfter the application form\ncomes a first interview and a selection board, you can also apply\nfor the Christmas course - but\nthere are many more opportunities\nto hear about that later. Perhaps I should really tell you about some\nof the benefits of working with\nUnilever: \u00a318k \u00a321k salary to start\nis the primary benefit and it\ndoesn't stand still when you\nactually start work, pension and\nlife assurance benefits are also\nincluded - as is the 25 days\nholiday (that's right, holiday and\nthe money with which to enjoy it!).\nUnilever also has a one year\ndeferment opportunity and up to\nfive years career break at a later\nstage.\nAnything else you want to know\nabout recruitment - you can find\nout at the presentation on 21st October or in the recruitment brochure or at\n\"recruit.unilever uk@ unilever.com.\"\nAny questions - please do ask.\nRECRUITMENT\nWEB SITE\nhttp://www.un iq. unilever.com\nThat's where you will find \"The\nUniq - Universal Challenge'.

If Unilever aimed to\nensure that everybody, in every\ncountry across the world, used at\nleast one Unilever product every\nday, they would not be too far from\nachieving it. Do you use Flora or\nOlivio or I Can't Believe It's Not\nButter? - then welcome to the\nworld of Unilever. When you eat a Cornetto in the UK, there is a good\nchance that somebody in China is\ntoo.\nBroadly, products fall into two\ncategories: foods and home and\npersonal care.

Our purpose is\nto meet everyday needs of people\neverywhere with products and\nservices which raise the quality of\nlife. We recognise that we can do\nthis only if we find more\nsustainable ways to run our\ncompany.\nWhat does that really mean?\nIt means that Unilever needs to\ntake real action. Eco-efficiency is\nproducing safe product, efficiently,\nfrom clean processes. So, Timotei\nbottles have been reduced in\nweight by 60% and washing\ndetergent packaging has been\nminimise d through smaller packs\nand refills. The washing powder\nprocess now uses 80% less energy\nand 90% less water. Freezer\ncabinets have been replaced with\nCFC free versions and waste\nproducts from tomato processing\nare used as a soil conditioner.\nSustainable consumption is\nabout responsibility and\nstewardship of natural resources;\nmore sustainable patterns of con-sump tion. Unilever has developed\ntools to analyse its contribution to\nenvironmental themes such as\nglobal warming, smog,\nnut rif i cation and solid waste.\nIdentifying your problem areas\nand setting targets is halfway to\nproviding your solution.\nThe Marine Stewardship\nCouncil is a partnership with the\nWorld Wide Fund for Nature\n(WWF). This partnership is a practical way to create a mechanism that uses market forces\nto create business incentives for\nsustainable fishing. The council\nwill be an independent, non-profit\nbody that establishes general\nprinciples for sustainable fishing\nand set standards for individual\nfisheries. Fish products sourced\nfrom certified fisheries meeting\nthese standards will be able to be\nmarked with an on-pack logo (look\nout for this in the next few years).\nLong term global solutions -looking at the wider aspects of\nmajor environmental issues\nthrough active engagement of\nothers - issues such as global\nwarming, water conservation and\nprotection of biodiversity need to\nbe dealt with responsibly and with\na broad base of participation -Unilever contributes a wealth of\nexperience and a willingness to\nlearn and improve to many\npartnerships, committees and\ndevelopment groups across the\nworld.\nThe Best Factory Award 1996\nIn November 1996, Van den Bergh\nFoods' margarine factory at\nPurfleet, Essex beat 230 other\ncontenders to win Process Industry\nBest Factory and Overall Factory\nof the Year in the Management\nToday Best Factory Awards. But,\njust why is it so special? The\nfactory has been in operation since\n1918, producing almost\ncontinually. It was rebuilt in the\n1970's and now works 24 hours a day, seven days a week to produce\n250,000 tonnes of emulsified fats\nper year; this supplies over 40% of\nthe UK market for margarine and\nlow fat spreads.\nThis factory used a New Look\nEmployment Method to re-approach industrial relations\nissues. Old fashioned\ndemarcation s were broken down,\novertime went and annual is ed hours arrived. This ensures staff\nare rewarded for doing well rather\nthan doing badly which the classic\novertime system encouraged.\nResource was also focussed on\nsmall units, which the factory was\nbroken down - in terms of\nmanagement, maintenance and\nmeasurement. Responsibility was\ngiven to operators through the\nTotal Productive Maintenance\n(TPM) programme - this is the\nmost advanced Unilever site in the\nUK in terms of TPM.\nThe whole thing has been a cultural change - having visited the\nsite myself - the staff seem full of\npride and enthusiasm for the\nfactory as it is now and for the\nchallenges that still lie ahead.\nTraining, involvement and a vision\nof the future have been a winning\nformula at Purfleet.\nUnilever Worldwide\nEtah integrated rural\ndevelopment programme\nUnilever has worked for about 20\nyears in the state of Uttar Pradesh,\nIndia, on a rural development\nprogramme to upgrade the animal\nhusbandry skills of local farms.\nThis programme known as the\nEtah initiative, was originally\ndesigned to improve the quality of\nmilk available for Unilever's dairy\nand has involved the co-operation\non the provision of tube wells,\nremediation of saline soils and the\nintroduction of improved cattle\nbreeds. The result was a sustained\nimprovement in the living\nstandards of over 100 villages in\none of the poorest regions of India.\nMANAGEMENT\nEDUCATION\nBy a current technical trainee\nNot only do we carry on with our\neducation at Unilever, but we do it\nin style. Unilever graduate\nUCMDS training must be one of\nthe best programmes in the world.\nIn the first year you cover\nstrategic, information and\noperations or markets manage-ment. The amount of knowledge\nyou gain through the courses and\nlearning programmes as well as\nyour job provides a very steep\nlearning curve - I suspect it won't stop in my second year! In second\nyear finance, people and markets\nor operations are the courses we\nfollow.\nOne of the best aspects is the\nweek long course that\naccompanies three of the modules.\nA great chance to meet other\nUnilever trainees from different\nfunctions and companies. The\ndiversities and similarities provide\nuseful debate within the formal\npart of the course - forming a business as well as social network\nduring the week. The quality of\nspeakers and trainers is very good\n- often they are experienced\nconsultants or senior Unilever\nmanagers.\nSocially - as well as the week\nlong courses - trainees tend to\nmeet up at various times during the\nyear. Sometimes just for drinks -others for a big night out or a party.\nOverall the training and\nassociated opportunities at\nUnilever, once called a business\nschool funded by soap powders\nand detergents, are excellent -probably one of the main reasons I joined.\nTetrahedral tea bags - Just how do you make\nthose 3D tea bags at nearly 2000 per minute?\n\n"

We have\na purpose built range in the Sports\nCentre which is certified for .22\nrifle from the standing, kneeling or\nprone positions and for low power\ncentre fire rifle from the standing\nand kneeling positions. We also do\nair rifle and pistol shooting and\nsome archery. We have visits to\nBisley to shoot at greater distances\nwith rifle and muzzle loading pistol\nand occasional shotgun shoots\nnear to London.\nThe loss of pistol shooting for\nthe club means the loss of enjoyment for many of our existing\nshooters and it also means that the\nchance of regaining the honour of\nbeing the best University pistol club\nin the country, which we lost to\nOxford last year, may not occur for\nsome years, if at all.\nIt was decided last term to\nincrease the amount of archery\npractised, both indoors and out, so\napproaches have been made for\nfunding of this to replace the\n\u00a38,000 worth of equipment stolen\nby the Government and to enable\nus to use the gardens behind the\nSports Centre on sunny days and at\nlonger distances than we can shoot\nindoors.

The\nsame has been said of the Pixies.\nThe lead singer was a handsome,\nfresh faced, blonde haired kid who\nalternately sang in Spanish and\nthen, without warning, started to\nyell as if a UFO had just flown off\nwith his sister and the lead guitarist\nmade pretty much every conceivable noise except the one you were\nexpecting. The rhythm section\nseemed perfectly normal. The\ndrummer, with more than his fair\nshare of stick twirling, laid down a foundation like a pile driver and\nconnected like a Siamese twin with\nthe bass player who, in a decidedly\nun rock like manner, had a smile\nthat could knock a man down.\nCharles Thompson (later to be\nknown as Black Francis), Kim Deal,\njoey Santiago and David Lovering\nslammed onto the scene in\nSeptember 1987 with their debut\nalbum Come On Pilgrim (taken\nfrom the lyrics of Levitate Me),\nsurfing in on the back of the surf-ing/punk/street culture sound that\nwas beginning to die out. When\nthey left to go their own separate\nways in the early nineties they\npaved the way for bands like\nNirvana, Smashing Pumpkins,\nGreen Day and Weezer and indeed\nas Smells Like Teen Spirit was rampaging up the charts the Seattle\nTrio remarked that it sounded for\nall the world like a Pixie's song.\nSome say that, that was the day\nthat counterculture started to die.\nDeath to the Pixies storms off\nwith the instrumental Cecilia Ann,\ncontinues with the Elastica-esque\nPlanet of Sound and continues with\nHere comes your Man, which you\ncould swear that you'd heard\nbefore, through Debaser , Holiday\nSong and finishing seventeen songs\nlater with the lilting Monkey Gone\nto Heaven.\nIf you like the Pixies, get this\nalbum. If you like proper indie then\nyou'll recognise all the albums\nyou've ever heard in here so get it\nto complete your musical timeline.\nIf you are into the rock/ indie/\ngeneric guitar bands scene then get\nthis album to give your collection\nsome credibility and if you're into\ndance then fuck off, you'll probably\nhate it although you should give it a listen just in case you do like it.\nI would like to point out that I do not favour people who listen to\nindie over those who prefer dance/\nhip hop/ techno/ thrash/ industrial/\njungle/ etc etc. I was merely indicating that if you listen almost\nexclusively to Sash, LT] Bukem et al\nthen you are unlikely to like this\nparticular. CI\nSimon W. STEREO LAB Dots and Loops * * *\nThis is Stereolab.\n(Sorry, we couldn't think of a better\ncaption.)\ni Stereolab always seem to have done their\n] own thing, and revelled in being anti-esta bj li sh ment in terms of the music scene. Well,\nl they have survived through the last few\nyears, and have re-surfaced again with another semi-pop record.\nOn initial listen of the album, the songs have a very\nsimilar sound to them that makes them as easy to distinguish as a shivering penguin on a crowded penguin\npopulated rocky isle in the middle of the Antarctic. If you\nallow the album a chance to drift into your subconscious\nthe songs will start to slowly edge their way into your\nthoughts. Tracks like Miss Modular with its excellent\nbasslines and upbeat mellowness, as opposed to the\nmainly downbeat type that prevails throughout, have a certain catch in ess about them that insinuates itself under\nyour skin. The French influenced rhythms are blatantly\napparent as well as some extremely off the beat affairs,\nwith a bit of post trip hop experimentation thrown in for\nreassurance that they're keeping up with the times.\nStereolab make good use of strings and brass parts to\ncreate elegant songs while still remaining mildly funk\nrhythmically. On the third track, The Flower Called\nNowhere, they even make use of a harpsichord synthesised sound that blends in with their music style just as\nwell as if it was being used for an old Mozart number.\nOverall it is probably an acquired taste, but it also\nhas the potential to appeal to a wider audience. CI\nJason\nFLUKE\nRisotto * *\nT here aren't enough hours in\nthe week. Things not of\nimmediate importance seem\nto get pushed back and back like\njetsam on a dirty tidal bore of half-finished jobs and chaotic stress.\nThus, it seemed the perfect solution\nto review this album in my sleep.\nThe first morning I forgot about\nit entirely, not recalling the experiment until 1 returned to my room\nthat evening and stood on the CD\ncover. The second time, 1 took\nmore care, setting the timer to\ntrigger just as 1 would be entering\nbeta-wave sleep. Nothing.\nSo its back to the conventional\nconscious method, and now what\nwent wrong. It's a professional\nalbum, but lacking - it doesn't take\nyou anywhere as a good ambient-t echo track should. There's no sur-p rises, no 'noises' cool enough to\nturn your head, and even when\ncranked up it fails to get apparently\nnormal people wiggling their backsides and saying \"this is a storming\ntrack\". Better luck next time. CI\nJeremy\n\n"

    "content": "An interview with Iain Ferguson\nChairman of Birds Eye Wall's and ex-technical trainee\nHow important is technology in\nUnilever?\nThe importance of technology in\nUnilever is very much dependent\non the products of the future - will\nthey be complex or simple? I believe they will become more\ncomplex with time and\nconsequently the technology will\nalso become more complex. We\nare also likely to continue the\nrelentless drive towards higher and\nhigher productivity. These two\neffects combined will increase the\nscale of our factories. The focus on\nthe removal of excess stock is also\nimportant - manufacturing is\nbecoming much closer to sales and\nthe consumer. Information systems\nare less factory focussed and stand\nalone moving towards an\nintegrated supply chain approach.\nIdeally as a consumer removes a packet off a shelf in the\nsupermarket, an action is triggered\nin the factory.\nThe other issue is that of third\nparty manufacture. In the current\nmixed economy Unilever\nproduces 75-80% of its own\nbrands. This is unlikely to change.\nBut there will be more and more\nstrategic partnerships with third\nparty manufacturers. This will\ncreate a new role of intelligent\ncustomer - looking at the technical\ncapability and managing the\ntechnical transfer between\ncompanies. Unilever is not likely\nto become a Benetton\noutsourcing all its production.\nUnilever makes money from its\noperations - making more this way\nthan through third party supply.\nThe major changes in recent\nyears in terms of operating have\nbeen the team working and total\nproductive maintenance\napproaches. Though Unilever is\nstill in the early stages of the\nimplementation of these practices\ncompared to the Far East and to\nsome extent, the USA, it is an\nemphasis Unilever will continue;\nremoving the operating /\nmaintenance barriers in our\noperations.\nWhat could a graduate expect in\na technical career at Unilever?\nIt is likely to be factory based.\nUnilever needs to continue to\ndevelop its factory management\nexpertise. Increasingly, the role\nwill reflect the closer integration\nwith the business through the\nsupply chain. As mentioned\nbefore, the intelligent customer\nrole in terms of production and\nservices will also be an important\narea.\nWhy should a graduate join\nUnilever?\nAs well as the excellent training\nthere are many reasons to join\nUnilever. We can provide a broad\nbased career - once a platform has\nbeen established in the company, it\nis possible to move to different\nareas of the business. There is\nno obligation to stay in\nengine ring. Unilever is full of interesting\ntechnology - its uses of IT,\npackaging machinery, logistics,\ntechnology application. It can\nbe difficult to portray the\nchallenge and excitement that\na technical career with an\nF MCG company provides\ncompared to something like\nmarketing - but three or four\nyears into your career - your\nexperiences will have been\nmuch more diverse and\nexciting than those from a more\ntraditional 'engineering'\nindustry. Manufacturing is \u2022\nmuch more interesting than a power station - how can bits of\nelectricity down a cable be exciting?\nIn the longer term there is the\npotential to move away from your\nhome country; that tends to happen\nat the right time for the person\nrather than straight away. Unilever\nbelieve that it is important to build\nup your expertise and network\ngroup in your company first before\nundertaking an overseas\nassignment. Then when you do go\nabroad you have a reason to be\nthere and a network to back you\nup.\nWhat is Unilever's future in the\nnext five years?\nConcentrating on the consumers'\nneeds, becoming even better at\nFrom technical beginnings it is\npossible to follow a general business\ncareer path - Iain himself and\nseveral group presidents are living\nproof of this.\nproducing\nproducts.\nand branding our\nSome words of advice:\u2022 Be clear about what you want\nto do.\n\u2022 Be clear of your choice\nbetween traditional engineering\nand a manufacturing environment.\nClarity is the key.\n\u2022 Take every opportunity to\nvisit plants and factories to see the\nindustries and have some hands-on understanding.\n\u2022 Be honest - man-management - is it important to\nyou? If so then the factory is\nprobably the right direction, if not,\nchoose something like logistics\nwhere it is less important.\nTOP OF THE CLASS\nProfessor Dominic Tildesley is a physical chemist at\nImperial College and he also works for Unilever. As\nan advisor on simulation and modelling, he gets\ninvolved with many aspects of the Unilever\nbusiness.\nUnipath\u2014\ninnovation in\nwomen's health\nUnipath, part of Unilever's Home\nand Personal Care Europe business\ngroup, are world leaders in the\nfield of women's health. It is the\ncompany that created one-step\npregnancy testing in the mid-1980's with Clearblue Onestep,\nrevolution ising the market and\nsetting a new standard for the\nindustry. This one-step technology\nhas made home pregnancy testing\nuser-friendly, reliable and\naccurate.\nUsing mono cl on al antibodies,\nUnipath developed and patented\nrapid assay technology, which now\nforms the basis of all the current\nproducts. Chief among these is\nPERSONA, the first method of\ncontraception to monitor a women's hormones, identifying\nthe days of her cycle when she is\nfree to make love without using\ncontraceptives.\nIn developing PERSONA,\nUnipath has forged two key\ntechnological advances. First, it\nhas used its patented technology to\nproduce the first home-use dual\nimmuno as say, capable of detecting\ntwo hormones simultaneously.\nSecond, using advances in\nmicroelectronics, it has developed\na state-of-the-art computerised\nMonitor that is capable of reading\nthe PERSONA Test Sticks and\nuses a sophisticated algorithm to\ndetermine a woman's fertility\nstatus.\nIn the future, Unipath will\nrespond first to women's needs,\ncreating the products that will lead\nwomen's health into the new\nmillennium.\nIce cream structures and\ncrystalline bridges between\ndetergent particles are just two of\nthe areas in which has collaborated\nwith the Unilever modelling team.\nHe says that there are some\ndifferences between pure research\nand working with industry: \"In\nacademic work we tend to change\ngoals. If you come up against a brick wall, you don't stand there\nand admire it, you move across\nand tackle a slightly different\nproblem. That's not true in\nUnilever. If you come up against a brick wall there, you often have no\nchoice but to tackle it head-on. You\nhave to find some approximate\nmethod of doing it, which is very\ndifficult.\"\nHe also confesses to being\nastonished at the speed with which\nproblems can be addressed in the\nindustrial environment.\n\n"

The\nlevel of noise caused by the fashion\nshows was generally considered to\nbe unacceptably loud for a working\nenvironment.\nAfter initial sound tests by engineers in the marquee on the\nQueen's Lawn created a disturbance, Ian Gillett (IC's Safety\nOfficer) was called in to monitor\nthe noise level of the music used.\nMr Gillett worked with the sound\nengineers to maintain a level of\n95dB inside the tent, equivalent to\nthat heard at a pop concert, and\nalso recorded levels of 70-75dB outside the tent would be the noise\nmade if Cromwell Road was redirected through the Queen's Lawn. Mr Gillett also recorded the\nsound level in a library conference\nroom when a show was taking\nplace and found it to be 58dB which is comparable to the noise\nmade be in normal conversation.\nDuring the week the College\nSecretary, Tony Mitchenson,\nreceived 5 official complaints from\npeople getting increasingly irritated by the constant noise. Felix was\ntold that the sound was \"horr en dous and awful\" from several people working on the third level of the\nSherfield building. The Student\nRecords Office, which was already\ninundated with work due to the\nforthcoming fresher s, also said that\nthey were unable to concentrate.\nOne assistant who came in early\nsaid that the noise was so bad that\n\"...the walls and the floor were\nactually vibrating from the noise\",\nfive of the assistants became so\nfrustrated that they shouted \"Shut\nup!\" in unison out of their window\nand secretaries in other offices\ncomplained of having headaches at\nthe end of the day.

He\njoined Unilever as a technical trainee - he felt that the people\nfrom Unilever were 'very switched on and motivated' and had\nbeen drawn to a technical management career through his\nearlier work experience. The interview went a bit like this...\nWhat are the best bits of your job?\nLeading change (mostly and hopefully for the better) and\nlearning all the time.\nAnd the worst bits?\nThe traditional end of industrial relations.\nWhat have been the highlights?\nRe-engineering a factory in both technology and structure and\nsticking around to make it work.\nWhere do you see yourself in five years time?\nBuilding a big new manufacturing plant.\nWhat is the most exciting place you have been to (connected\nto work)?\nThe highlands of Kenya.\nWhat car do you drive?\nGolf GTI.\nDo you get a good salary?\nI scrape by\nWhat do you remember about Imperial College?\nThree Kings Pub, brainy people, way too much work, really\nnasty exams.\nWhy did you choose Unilever?\nPossibility of working overseas, good starting salary, offered\nendless career options, liked their ice creams.\nWhat advice can you give to today's undergraduate?\nDon't plan too hard - go for what you think you will enjoy -be honest and be prepared to change direction if necessary.\nUNILEVER TRIATHLON\nIt's11am on a very cold morning\nand I'm standing in the middle of a field, in my swimming trunks.... in\nHolland!\nNo, I'm not doing some silly rag\nstunt, I left college a couple of years\nago. The first time I heard about the\nannual Unilever triathlon was at\nleast six months ago, the comfort of\n\"plenty of time for training\" was\nenough to persuade me. Well, I'm here and, needless to say, the\n\"comfort of having done lots of\ntraining\" is not. Maybe I shouldn't have had those beers last night as\nwell. I'm amongst a crowd of\npeople from the ten or so other UK Unilever companies, a lot of friends\nthat I 've picked up since my time in\nUnilever, even a couple that I went\nto Imperial with. Luckily I'm cheating in the triathlon and doing\nthe team event - one discipline\neach - seeing as I'm wearing\nswimming trunks there's no way I can change to the bike ride.\nBANG!!! I jump into the water with the\nother ten people in my lane, fifty\nmetres each length, ten lengths to\ngo (and this is the shortest race\navailable, the full triathlon is eight\ntimes bigger). Ten lengths happen\nfairly quickly - though not quickly\nenough for the rest of my team!\nI'm not exactly first, but not\nexactly last, but the bikes are away\nand I can relax, free beer in the bar\nall evening then a night on the\ntown in Utrecht...\nNot exactly a typical working\nday at Unilever, but by no means\nunfamiliar. Most of my friends and\ncolleagues participate regularly in\nsporting, social and community\nevents, from fun runs to the Flora\n(another Unilever product)\nLondon Marathon which our\nChairman, along with many\nemployees, enjoyed participating\nin earlier this year. I don't think I need to explain the seamless\ntransition of my social life from\nImperial to a career with Unilever.\nHow sport can get you a job\nDo you arrange fixture after\nfixture? Organise the team to be\nthere on time and playing the right\nposition? Coach new players to be\npart of a successful team? Then\nyou could be making the path\ntowards that job you really want.\nIn fact, an active role in any extra\ncurricular activity could put you in\nfront of the other candidates.\nIf you can identify which skills\nyour role has helped you develop\nand which qualities you have that\nallow you to do the job well, then\nyour CV is halfway to being\nwritten.\nThink about these ones...\nLeadership\nStrategic and as a spokesperson.\nOrganisational skills\n(1) \u00a3\u00a3 MONEY \u00a3\u00a3 - controlling\nthe finances - so you can have new\nkit and still afford the end of year\nbash. (Perhaps you initiated some\nform of sponsorship?)\n(2) Getting all of the fixtures\narranged, teams organised and\ntransport that gets you all there\nand back.\n(3) Foreign tour planning is a task of arranging fixtures,\novercoming language barriers,\naccommodation, travel and\nreciprocal events.\nTeamworking\nNew recruits every year stretch\nyour abilities to pull together a successful team.\nCommunication Skills\nHow do you make sure the\nwhole team knows the location,\ngame plan and pub to meet in.\nBeach sports backed by\nUnilever brands\nSeveral up-and-coming beach\nsports have been sponsored by\nUnilever brands in Europe over the\nsummer.\nIn the UK, Elida Faberge's Salon\nSelectives shampoo sponsored the\nBritish Beach Volleyball Open\nChampionships. After contests on\nfour beaches dotted around the\nUK, the finals were held on a specially constructed beach in\nLondon's Battersea Park.\nIn Germany, a crowd of 16,000\nfans flooded onto a beach near\nLubeck to see the finals of the\nNational Beach Volleyball\nMasterSeries Championships, cosponsored by Liptonice, the tea-based beverage. Beach volleyball\nis popular in Germany and its\nintroduction at the Olympic\nGames in Atlanta last year has\nmarked its arrival on the world\nstage. The series attracted 50,000\nspectators and the finals received\ntwo hours of national television\ncoverage.\nAlso in Germany, Langnese,\nUnilever's German ice cream\nbrand, together with Kodak,\nbrought the action-packed amateur\nsand football to Europe for the first\ntime, with tournaments in five\ncities, watched by more than\n100,000 people. Some 300\namateur and four professional\nteams took part in the tour which\nattracted good coverage on\nGerman television.\nFlora's great day out\nBlue skies and perfect conditions\ncheered on the 29,000 runners in\nthe 1997 Flora London Marathon\nlast April.\nMaking the Marathon an extra\nspecial event for Unilever this year\nwas the participation of our\nChairman, Niall Fitzgerald. He\nraised over \u00a3250,000 for Save the\nChildren after completing the\ncourse in 4 hours 46 minutes -After the race, Niall said: 'I thought I was doing quite well\nuntil I was overtaken by an\noctopus!' Congratulations to him\nand all the other Unilever\ncompetitors this year. Unilever's sponsorship of this event allowed\nover \u00a310 million to be raised for\nvarious charities.\n\n"

    "content": "16 FILM 17 October 1997\nFry is Wilde About the Boy\nWILDE\nStarring: Stephen Fry, Jude Law,\nVanessa Redgrave, Jennifer Ehle\nDirector: Brian Gilbert\nReleased to coincide with the\n100th anniversary of Oscar\nWilde's imprisonment for\nhomosexuality, Wilde tells the true\ntale of his traumatic life. We follow\nthe literary genius achieving\nnotoriety with the publication of\n\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\"\nthrough to his falling out with the\nestablishment over his affair with\nLord Alfred Douglas. It shows how\nhis wife, Constance Lloyd, coped\nwith the scandals surrounding her\nhusband and the Victorian public's reaction to his famous speech\ndefending \"The Unspoken Love\"\nfelt by an old man to a younger\none.\nMuch hype has been made of\nthe fact that this is the role Stephen\nFry was \"born to play\". Apart from\nlooking like the great Oscar Wilde\nhe shares much of his wit, flamboyance and creativity and he clearly\nrelished the chance to take on the\nrole. Personally, however, 1 found\nthis a distraction as I was\nconstantly aware of how much Fry\nwas enjoying dressing up in\nVictorian clothes and being the\ncentre of attention. I do not have\nanything against actors enjoying\ntheir job, but it is disconcerting\nwhen they are portraying the most\ntragic moments of somebody's life.\nBut this is a minor gripe in what is\noverall an interesting and\neducational film.\nBased on Richard Ellmann's definitive biography, Wilde focuses\non the author's personal life rather\nthan his career. Rising star Jude\nLaw plays Lord Douglas, or\n\"Bosie\", who dominated Wilde and\nintroduced him to the rent boys\nwho were to play such a large part\nin the writer's last years. There are\nsome very effective scenes involving the two although the explicit\nnature will un doubt ably offend\nsome of the audience. Fry is at his\nbest when Wilde is trying to reconcile his love for his children with his\npassion for Bosie. Unfortunately,\nthese scenes are accompanied by a slightly clumsy narrative and\ndozens of shots of his two kids\npeering longingly out of a window\non a rainy day, but this is the\nStephen Fry. He's loving it.\nexception in a very well directed\nfilm.\nOverall then this is a rare film,\nwhich is simultaneously funny,\nendearing and intelligent. In other\nwords, it is a perfect tribute to the\nman himself. It is just a shame that\nit has taken 100 years for\nsomebody to be brave enough to\nmake it. D Chris Hickey\nHard Eight is\nHARD EIGHT\nStarring: Samuel L Jackson,\nGwyneth Paltrow, Philip Baker Hall\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\njust Craps\nH ard Eight is not, unfortunately, a double\nentendre. It is gambling parlance for the\nbetting in craps that the dice will come\nup again as two fours after it has just happened.\nIt is a tough bet, unlikely to come up, and is a metaphor for the lives of the characters in the\nfilm. Apparently.\nThe story begins with Sydney, a seasoned\nold gambler, befriending the out-of-luck John,\nfor reasons of his own. Sydney teaches him the\nway around the seedy casinos of Reno, Nevada,\nuntil John befriends the rough Jimmy (Samuel L. Jackson, in fine twisted form). Clementine\n(Gwyneth Paltrow) works in the bars of the\ncasinos, as well as the bedrooms, and falls\nunder the wing of Sydney, only for her and John\nto fall in love. A meeting with a client for\nClementine goes wrong, causing the film to turn\ntowards its violent climax.\nThe trouble with this film is that this is all\nthat happens. The film is well directed, with\nfirst-time writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson\nmore than competent in the technical\ndepartment with good use of stead i cam and\nclose-ups. However, since so little happens in\nthe film the emphasis is on the character\ninteraction and dialogue to move the story for-ward. While the acting is very good, the\nconversations are stilted and the ponderous\nnature of the \"quiet moments\" means that the\nonly 'hard eight' the film title could be referring\nto is the number of numb buttocks in the\ncinema.

Emergency services arrived\non the scene a few moments later\nand the fire brigade investigated\nthe basement of the Blackett\nbuilding wearing protective chemical suits and oxygen equipment.\nThe police cordoned off the\nQueen's Gate side of Prince\nConsort Road, up to the\nAeronautics and Chemical\nEngineering building, and parts of\nthe walkway were also closed.\nThe potentially lethal situation was\ncleared up in about an hour.

The protest, which\ntakes place on the 1st of\nNovember, is hoped to attract\nschool children, parents and the\npublic as well as students but is this\nall too little, too late?\nThe proposals were recommended by the Dearing report in\nAugust and, while there have been\nfiery words from the NUS, there\nhas been little action to back them\nup. This is in stark contrast to the\nThatcher years where even the\nmention of student loans and grant\nfreezes sparked an explosion of\nNUS demonstrations all over the\ncountry, as well as numerous television and newspaper appearances\ncondemning the Conservative gov-ern ment' s proposals.\nWhether right or wrong, the\nnew proposals are in a different\nleague to the loans and grant\nfreezes of the Eighties. They\nremove all pretence of a free higher education. Why then such subdued campaigning, and why so late\nin the day? Surely a better time for\nthe NUS to make a storm would\nhave been at the Labour conference where the much talked about\nrebellion against the proposals\nfailed to materialise.\nHas New Labour molded a New NUS in its own image? The\nhigher ranks of the NUS have long\nbeen a stepping stone to a Labour\nparty career. The Home Secretary,\nJack Straw, was once an NUS pre s ident, as was Phil Woolas MP and\nthe General Election held on the\n1 st of May brought many more\nNUS leaders into the ranks of\nLabour MPs.\nUnder the Conservatives, a career via the NUS was one against\nthe establishment, whereas now it\nis a career step into the establish-ment.

    "content": "17 October 1997 COLUMNS\nLast time a Prime Minister met\nthe leader of the Irish\nRepublicanism, Lloyd George's career was soon to end, and\nMichael Collins' life was to go the\nsame way. The recent handshake\nbetween Blair and Adams, may be a historical moment, but we worry\nwhat it might be remembered for.\nSinn Fein is not in talks to reach a happy agreement, but in the word\nof Martin McGuinness, to 'smash\nthe Union'. In the meantime, the\nIRA maintains the means to return\nto 'military operations' should the\ntalks not reach a 'satisfactory out-come'.\nNaturally Mr Adams welcomed\nthe decision, saying \"we a re dealing with a man who certainly recognises that this is an historic opportunity... if there's going to be\nchange, it needs to be change by\nthe British government and I hope\nMr Blair will bring that about.\"\nSenior Unionists expressed their\ndispleasure, with David Trimble giving the mild comment that \"we\nthink it is rather sad that the Prime\nMinster thinks it is necessary.\" The\ncrowds in the street were less sub-tle, calling Blair, 'scum', 'filth' and\n'traitor'. He required over fifty\nbodyguards to escort him through\nthe streets.\nThe Prime Minister understands\nthat little if any progress will be\nmade if he becomes fixed in his\nways - indeed people in Northern\nIreland welcomed the change of\ngovernment as it gave a fresh\nNorthern Ireland, and finally the\nPrime Ministerial Handshake. Bill\nClinton's handshake in December\n1995 occurred remarkably soon\nbefore the return to violence in\nFebruary 1996.\nPoliticians' handshakes never\nhad a great record in solving entangled issues - witness Rabin and\nHamish Common\nWestminster\nEye\nimpetus to the negotiations.\nHowever it seems that the\nRepublican side are pocketing an\narray of concessions with little sign\nof any gestures in return. Prisoners\nhave been moved nearer their fam-i lies, or released entirely, in both\nthe UK and the Republic, internment removed from the statute\nbook, weakening of the 'martial\nlaw' that has been ever present in\nArafat's handshake in 1993. Rabin\nwas assassinated, his successor\nlost the election, and the situation\nnow looks little short of a war. The\nRepublican movement have plenty\nof 'progress' that they need to\nmake. Their situation is simple:\nthey want Northern Ireland as a part of the Republic. The Unionists\nwant the status quo. As such, the\nRepublicans will shake hands with\nanybody, as it improves |\ntheir image (there's plenty\nof progress that needs to be made\nthere too),and their case. The\nUnionists are rather less keen on\nshakes separatists' hands. This situation - the separatists' friendly\nimage - can be seen in any other\nequivalent case (Scotland, Wales\netc.). Thus the republican joy at this\nHandshake.\n'Pressing the flesh' with Gerry\nAdams, even if it is a calculated and\ntactical move, is a highly dangerous\nmove in a game with big stakes (at\npresent over 3000 people lost their\nlives in the Troubles). Blair will\nknow that his move will have weakened the Unionist position in talks,\nreducing their wish to compromise,\nwhilst leaving Sinn Fein with the\nenviable position of having secured\na propaganda coup with no\nresponse required. Those whose\nposition may need bolstering may\nnot be the terrorists' political\nwings, but the democratic parties\nwhose patience has been so sorely\ntested in the past weeks.\nHAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS\nHAIRCUT\n\u00a38.00\nUNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX\nINCLUDES:\\ CONSULTATION with stylist to discuss your style, try\na new look and learn how to manage and control your hair.\nA SHAMPOO followed by Herbal Conditioner and scalp\nmassage.= V PRECISION HAIRCUT by fully qualified hair stylist,\nexperienced in modern hairdressing.\ncV USE OF HAIR DRIER with complementary gel or\nmousse to finish your style.\nOPEN 9.00AM6.00 PM Last Appointment for Hair Cut 6.00pm Phone for information on other special offers, e.g. Perms.
