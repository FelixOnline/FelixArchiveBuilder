For real though yesterday was so hot I almost\npassed out while waiting to grab a coke at the bar.\nOther tell-tale signs of the arrival of Summer include:\nan increase in threats of libel, the evaporation of\nthe editorial team, our desperate use of freedom\nof information requests to generate content, the\nquestionable quality of the centrefolds, the front\ncovers and overarching themes, and of course the\ndistinct feeling that everyone at Imperial has stopped\ncaring and is one curly fry away from giving up and\nfucking off to some sea-side destination.\nStill we\u2019ll persevere. At least until mid-June. Then I\u2019m\noff on holiday.\nThis week we thought we\u2019d do a homage to\neverybody\u2019s second home, the Central Library.\nImperial\u2019s glistening rectangular temple of learning;\nshrine of tears, sacrificial altar of broken dreams and\nevery delivery person\u2019s favorite late night destination.\nWe wrote a retrospective on every major work it\u2019s\nundergone over the last decade, laced with insights\non expenditures gained from targeted freedom of\ninformation requests.\nWe also took a look at the Central Library\u2019s night owl\nculture because clearly we have nothing better to do\nthan wander around the library after midnight and ask\npeople what they think of the toilets.\nSure, this edition might be a bit dry but so are our\nparched mouths and if we had it our way we\u2019d have\nclosed shop already.

Under a huge\nmakeshift planetarium dome\nactors in modern dress hurtle\naround the circular stage.\nBrendan Cowell as the titular\nman never seems to stop, at\none moment stabbing apples\nto illustrate the concept\nof gravity, and the next\nbodily spinning Billy Howle\nplaying Andrea, his pupil to\ndemonstrate the rotation of\nthe earth; he never seems\nto lower his voice beyond a\nmid-bellow. That it\u2019s energetic\ncannot be denied, but at times\nLife of Galileo\n| Stars, Revolution, and Rock\nand Roll\nIndira Mallik\nLife of Galileo is on at the Young\nVic until the1st\nof July\nTickets from \u00a310\nBilly Howle in Life of Galileo at the Young Vic \\\\\nJohan Persson\nact essential to building the\natmosphere of the produc-tion; but in others it lends the\naura of an over-egged Brian\nCox documentary to the\nproceedings.\nJoe Wright, who some\nyears ago directed the Keira\nKnightley version of Pride\nand Prejudice is clearly a fan\nof modernising classic stories\nwith modern twists (the film\ndoesn\u2019t much concern itself\nwith staying faithful to the\nperiod). It\u2019s easy to see the\nallure of shaking off historical\ntrappings to make a work\nrelevant. In this production,\nthe effect is mixed. Life of\nGalileo is already a story of\nan era defining discovery, it\nhas passion and oppression,\nlove and betrayal, it is a story\nof revolution (both literal and\nfigurative); grand enough in\nscope without the sexing up\nthat Wright seems to think is\nrequires.\nWhen the action reaches\nits more emotional peaks,\nand the actors are left to\nsimply deliver the lines, it is\nelectrifying. Brendan Cowell\nas an ailing Galileo taking\nstock of his life is deeply\nmoving, Ayesha Antoine is\ncriminally under-used, but in\nthe brief flashes she appears\non stage in her role as the\nput upon no-nonsense Mrs\nSarti, she sparkles with wit,\nwe don\u2019t see much of Anjana\nVasan as Galileo\u2019s daughter\nVirginia either, but she too\ngives the small character\nplenty of pathos. The standout\nperformance is by Billy Howle\nwho as Galileo\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9\ndelivers a performance\nthat is very often funny and\noccasionally deeply affecting\nas he spans three decades\nof the life of Andrea, from\npetulant curiosity as a ten-year-old, to uncompromising\nidealism eight years later,\nand finally to humility and\nforgiveness as he sets out\nto carry on his estranged\ntutor\u2019s work. Brecht\u2019s work,\ncommonly associated with\nMarxism, is fiercely political.\nLike so many of the works\nthat found poignancy in the\n80s, the focus on the dogma\nof authority figures, the wilful\nignorance and suppression of\nknowledge by governments\nand leaders in power strikes\na chord now. Just as a little\nway down the south bank at\nthe National Theatre, Angels\nin America is about the inevitability of progress, here too\nin Life of Galileo the recurring\ntheme of the importance of\ntruth is both a rebuke to the\ncurrent climate of double\nspeak and \u201cfake news\u201d, and a\n\\\\ This production\nthrums with energy,\nin trademark\nWright style, pure\nentertainment from\nstart to finish \\\\\nit gets a little too much.\nThe first act is almost entirely\nexposition, indeed, at times\nit feels uncannily like a low-fi\nRoyal Society Christmas\nLecture demonstration. While\nit effectively establishes\nGalileo as a teacher and a\nscientist brimming with energy\nand bombast, it drags a little\ntowards the end. The scenes\nare intercut occasionally by\nlight shows on the screen\nsuspended like a dome above\nthe stage: there, vistas of\nconstellations and far off galaxies appear to a soundtrack\nof seat shaking, feel-it-in-your-bones, bass-heavy rock\nmusic. The music has been\ncomposed by Tom Rowlands,\none half of the Grammy-winning The Chemical Brothers.\nIt\u2019s a glorious score and\nin some parts \u2013 especially\nnear the close of the second\n\\\\ The recurrent\ntheme in Life of\nGalileo of the\nimportance of truth\nis both a rebuke to\nthe current climate\nof double speak and\n\u201cfake news\u201d, and a\nsalve \\\\\nsalve \u2013 such a climate cannot,\nBrecht concludes, last forever,\nsomehow, truth will out.\nThe Young Vic is always a\njoy to visit, the small venue,\nthe proximity of the actors\nand action lends immediacy\nto the performances. Here,\nwhere so much for the staging\nwas done to include the\naudience, it was more so. Life\nof Galileo tends towards the\nheavy handed, but is no less\nenjoyable for it. Whatever\nits' shortcomings it is never\nboring: laugh out loud\nhilarious in places, menacing\nin others, this production\nthrums with energy; it is, in\ntrademark Wright style, pure\nentertainment from start to\nfinish.\nM\nanwatching\noffers an\ninsight into\nthe world\nof sex from\na female\nheterosexual point of view.\nThe show consists of a roughly\n60 minute monologue, which\nexplores several aspects of\nsex, including masturbation,\nsexual fantasies and consent.\nThe prose is raw, explicit\nand dynamically written.\nIn every performance the\nmonologue is read aloud by\na male comedian who has no\nprevious exposure to the text.\nThe result is an impromptu\nexperience that is funny and\nat times a bit shambolic.\nI went to see the piece\non its second night at the\nRoyal Court in Sloane\nSquare. I sat amongst a\ndiverse audience (both in\nage and gender) in the\nsmall upstairs auditorium.\nThe room was painted\nblack and on the stage\nfloor there were two raised\nplatforms housing a printer\nand a jug of water. After a\nfew minutes a man walked\nout in an expensive shirt\nand shorts with a vaguely\nfamiliar bearded face. He\nannounced that his name\nwas Adam Buxton and he\nwould be giving tonight\u2019s\nperformance. Perhaps the\nexpectation was palpa-ble; on other nights Nick\nFrost and Phil Jupitius\nwould be performing.\nBuxton addressed this\nwith characteristic ease,\n\u201cso I know you are all a\nbit disappointed\u201d, before\nproceeding into a light\nhearted biography. He is a\ncomedian and actor, with\nan impressive portfolio of\nscript writing and he now\nhosts a podcast. Meanwhile the printer whirred\nbehind him, producing the\n28 page monologue. The\nappearance of two yellow\npages, Buxton explained,\nwould mean the reading\ncould begin.\nHe started, and at once\nthe audience relaxed into\nthe rhythm of the piece. You\ncould tell Buxton had practice\nin script reading, his pacing\nwas good and his phrasing\ndynamic. Most importantly\nhe adopted the jocular tone\nof the author. We could tell\nit was his first time seeing\nthe script, and through\neyebrow raising, dramatic\npauses and what I presumed\nwere ad-libbed comments,\nthe whole experience felt\norganic. There were some\nstumbling points, 28 pages is\nManwatching |\nWhat Women\nReally Want\nClaire Chan\nManwatchingwasonattheRoyal\nCourt Theatre the 10th\nto the 20th\nof May\nManwatching \u2013 \"written by an anonymous wom-an, performed by an unprepared man\" \\\\ Helen\nMurray\nby the writer\u2019s discursive train\nof thought. Seemingly benign\nanecdotes become sexualised\nand the narrative jumps\nbetween distant themes with\nonly the most rudimentary\nsegues. The fact that the narrator is as surprised by this as\nthe audience creates a powerful shared experience. We\nare more prone to laughter\nwhen we feel slightly uncom-fortable, and the nervous\nchuckles that accompanied\nthe first minutes reading soon\ngave way to hearty roars\nfrom the crowd.\nDoes it matter that the narrator is a man? In many ways\nit\u2019s vital for the success of the\npiece. Manwatching is after\nall just that. Watching a man\nreact and respond to the truth\nabout feminine heterosexual\ndesire. Personally I found\nsome of the passages to be\ngenuinely enlightening. I have\nno doubt that this was the\ncase for Buxton and the male\ncomponent of the crowd as\nwell. Pieces like this are not\nonly important because they\nbreak down the taboo culture\nof talking about sex, they also\nunify the gender divide in\nunderstanding it.\nWho wrote Manwatching?\nWe never find out. I think it\u2019s\nimportant that we don\u2019t. The\nthemes covered in the text\nare universal and anonymity\nreflects this. This is further\nconveyed in the monologue\u2019s\nconclusion where women in\nthe audience are prompted to\nstand and claim provenance\nof the work. It\u2019s in appropriate end to the 90 minute\nreading and the applause\nthat follows is undoubtedly\nsincere.\nAfter the show, Buxton is\ngiven flowers and then leaves.\nWe follow behind, having all\nlaughed and thought a good\ndeal. Unanimously, I think we\nall feel a lot closer to Buxton\nnow too.\n\\\\ The prose\nis raw, explicit\nand dynamically\nwritten... nervous\nchuckles that\naccompanied the\nfirst minutes reading\nsoon gave way to\nhearty roars from\nthe crowd \\\\\na lot to get through in one sit-ting. Occasionally these were\nfunny, misread words creating\nadditional dirty meanings\nin the text. Sometimes they\nwere prohibitive, and we\nwould have to wait as Buxton\nretraced his thoughts. This\nwas to be expected; Buxton\nhandled it all very smoothly.\nTo help him, the monologue\ncould have been made\nshorter, and perhaps some\nof the awkward phrasing\nsmoothed to make it more\nfirst-read friendly.\nIt\u2019s important I do not give\ntoo much away regarding the\ncontent of the monologue.\nPart of the fun in this piece is\nbeing shocked and surprised\n\n"

I\nmust say I\u2019ve gained so\nmuch from this trip in many\naspects.\nI didn\u2019t do any background\nresearch on the destination\nbeforehand but went with the\nhope of letting the country\nand its people surprise me\nwhile there. The whole experience started before even\nchecking in at the airport\nwhen I was \u2018interrogated\u2019 for\n10 minutes on lots of random\nquestions. These included\nwhy do I study in the UK,\nwho packed my luggage, and\nwho has touched it during my\ntravel to the airport etc. After\nthat, I was cleared to proceed to check in. This made\nme realise that this country\ndefinitely prioritises security.\nOn the flight, my mind was\nrefreshed by the slogan of\nin-flight duty free shopping:\n\u201clowest price at highest\naltitude\u201d. This made me more\neager for the upcoming\ntech trip and to find out how\nthis country has become a\nworld-leading start-up country whilst at war with most of\nits neighbours.\nUpon arrival, our tour guide\nYoni asked everyone to think\nof the most embarrassing\nstory in our life and what we\nlearnt from it. While exchanging our stories we laughed,\nlearned and started to understand the spirit that makes\nthe Israeli State \u2013 people\nhere don\u2019t fear failure, they\nlearn from it and rise again\non it! This spirit was further\nseen in the many start-up\ncompanies that we visited\nlater (Google, Intel, Reporty\netc.). While visiting these\nstart-up/technology compa-nies, their successful business\nmodels were discussed, the\nnew investing market was\nexplored and the latest prod-ucts/ideas were introduced.\nThis was a well-rounded\nlearning experience.\nThough each day\u2019s agenda\nwas really packed, there was\na good combination of visiting revolutionary companies\nand mingling with the 40\nother students on the trip from\nacross 12 Imperial depart-ments. Every night we drank,\nwe danced, we chatted and\nthe next morning would wake\nup at 6:30am for another\nlong day. To be honest, I only\nhad 3 hours sleep every day\nfor a week and I still don\u2019t\nknow how I managed to live\nthrough that. It was one of the\nmost colourful weeks of my\nlife! When I see the people\nfrom the trip again on campus\nnow I really can feel there is\na special bond between all\nof us!\nThe committee also\narranged dinner with local\nIsraeli university students\nduring the trip. I enjoyed\nlistening to these students\nsharing their military\nexperience and how it has\ntoughened their personalities.\nPersonally, the most touching moment during this trip\nwas the visit to Yad Vesham.\nWe have all heard sad stories\nabout Jewish people from\nWWII but actually standing\nin the museum, seeing these\nhistorical preserved objects\nand listening to the stories\nfrom Yoni everyone couldn\u2019t\nhelp but tear up. This heavy\nhistory reminds humanity that\nwe shouldn\u2019t let any similar\ntragedy happen again to any\nrace.\nWe then moved on to visit\nthe holy city of Jerusalem.\nInstead of seeing chaos and\nconflicts between those of different religious beliefs I saw a\nJewish old man sat down with\na Christian old man having\ntea and chatting about their\nday. This wasn\u2019t the picture I\nheld for Jerusalem but now I\ncould see there was friendship\nbetween conflicting religions\nin this so-called conflict city!\nThe group in Israel \\\\ Daniel Voignac\nTheana Johnson talks history, military and food in Israel\nI\nlove travelling and\ndiscovering new places.\nSo when I heard\nabout the trip to Israel\norganised by the Israeli\nsociety I jumped on\nthe opportunity to go to a\ncountry I had never been\nto. I expected to explore the\nstart-up and historic culture of\nIsrael, visit some companies\nand sights and have a great\ntime. But the experience\nwas beyond all of my\nexpectations. It wasn\u2019t great,\nit was phenomenal! I came\nback with so many incredible\nmemories of places, people\nand moments, truly impressed\nby this country built in such a\nshort amount of time and am\nvery realistically considering\nliving there at some point in\nmy life.\nEverything we did was\ninteresting, captivating and\nentertaining from the talks by\nstart-up legends to culinary\ntours of the street markets of\nboth Tel Aviv and Jerusalem\nto the visit to universities and\nhistorical landmarks. We had\nnearly no time off or sleep\nbut looking back none of us\nwould have had it any other\nway.\nI love food and consider\nmyself a very real food\ntourist, so obviously I need to\nmention the food as it was an\nintegral part of my experi-ence. Shak-shuka, falafel,\nshawarma, and of course my\nconstant hummus food-baby\nwere definite highlights of the\ntrip.\nOur guide took us through\nall the aspects of the state of\nIsrael, its history, its economical and political situation\nand its people. I found it\nespecially important that we\nmet with locals to discuss and\nget a perspective on what we\nhad learned about including\nthe start-up nation, the\nmilitary service, the history\nof the Holocaust, the Jewish\nreligion, and student life. Not\nonly did we meet locals, but\nwe also met foreigners who\nXingchen Zhou recommends Israel | 10/10 would visit again.\n\\\\ Everything we\ndid was interesting,\ncaptivating and\nentertaining \\\\\nhad moved to Israel and their\nhappiness in this country was\napparent to all of us.\nBeyond the action-packed\n\\\\ I found it\nespecially important\nthat we met with\nlocals to discuss and\nget a perspective\non what we had\nlearned about \\\\\nprogram, what made the\ntrip was the people. 40 of\nus who didn\u2019t all know each\nother at the start yet in just 6\ndays we laughed, danced,\nshared moments like we do\nwith friends we\u2019ve known for\nyears. I met people from the\nBusiness school that we never\nusually interact with and discovered a whole new aspect\nof Imperial that is full of the\nfunniest people ever. The differences in age, nationalities,\nsubjects made it all the more\nspecial.\nI will be eternally grateful to\nDaniel and the committee for\norganising this fantastic trip.\nLecheim!\n\n"

You know,\nyou make plans\nwith them only to\nhave them cancel at the last\nminute. Maybe this happens\nrepeatedly. They\u2019re really\nfucking annoying, right?\nMaybe you don\u2019t even want\nto bother to reschedule.\nMaybe they\u2019re so flaky that\nyou eventually ghost them\nas friends or maybe they\ndrive you nuts but something\nkeeps you from severing ties,\ndespite the mild dread that\ncomes every time you make\nplans with them.\nI am this person. I am a\nmassive flake. I am someone\nwho makes plans and cancels them all the time, and I\ngenerally don\u2019t feel at all bad\nabout it. It\u2019s controversial,\nI know. But before you just\npush me aside as a terrible\nperson, hear me out.\nPeople get hella angry\nabout flaking. Honestly, I\nwould say that the majority\nof rants that I hear from my\nfriends about their social lives\nare about people cancelling\non them at the last minute.\nIt is really annoying, I get\nthat. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the\ncardinal sin that it\u2019s made out\nto be.\nPerhaps it\u2019s just the introvert\nin me, but I\u2019m not usually\nhideously offended or put\nout when someone cancels\non me. That\u2019s not to say that\nI wouldn\u2019t otherwise have\nmade plans with someone\nelse if I had that evening/\nafternoon/brunch slot free\n\u2013 I have a perfectly active\nsocial life with more friends\nthan I have time to see as\nmuch as I want to see them,\nI\u2019m just not in the mood for\npeople. Sometimes, no matter\nhow much I love you and\nno matter how much I enjoy\nbeing around you, I will\nnot enjoy a social engage-ment, and I will not be good\ncompany.\nAnd this is okay, It\u2019s good to\nrecognise this. It\u2019s better for\nus both and for our friendship\nexclusively say that cancelling\nbecause you\u2019re just not in\nthe mood isn\u2019t an excuse,\nbecause if you go anyway\nyou\u2019ll end up having a good\ntime. I mean, great, if that\u2019s\nalways the case for you, but\nI know myself well enough to\nbe able to say what is gonna\ncheer me up and what is not.\nIf I don\u2019t want to see you right\ninconvenienced someone.\nThere is now someone out\nthere either scrambling to\nfind someone else who has\nbeen flaked on to hang out\nwith, or resigning themselves\nto a slightly boring night in.\nBut you know what, that\u2019s\nnot going to kill them. I have\nno problems admitting that\nI\u2019m going to put myself first\nday to day, and if that means\ncancelling plans, so be it.\nLike, don\u2019t be a dick. If\nyou\u2019re consistently cancelling\nplans, don\u2019t make so many\nplans. If you\u2019re always cancelling plans with the same\nperson, be mature enough to\nre-evaluate that friendship.\nDon\u2019t be a flake because\nyou can\u2019t tell the difference\nbetween an obligation\nfriendship and a friendship\nthat you\u2019re actually gaining\nsomething from. Be a flake\nbecause you don\u2019t want to\nforce anything or to have a\nshitty time. But accept your\nflakiness and cancel early,\nbe the best possible flake you\ncan be, and you don\u2019t have to\nfeel guilty at all.\n\\\\ I am someone\nwho makes plans\nand cancels them\nall the time, and I\ngenerally don\u2019t feel\nat all bad about it\n\u2013 it\u2019s controversial, I\nknow \\\\\n\\\\ It\u2019s just not\nsocially acceptable\nto say you\u2019re a\nglake \u2013 unless you\nhave exclusively\nexcellent, self-care\nrespecting friends,\nyou\u2019re going to\ncome up against\nsome hostility if\nyou bail on drinks\nbecause you just\nwant to be alone \\\\\nthank you very much \u2013 but if\nit means that I end up having\na rare evening to myself, I\ndon\u2019t really mind that either.\nWhether or not my friend has\ngiven me a good reason or\nis obviously just too lazy to\ntravel into Central London, it\ndoesn\u2019t really matter.\nBecause the thing is, I cancel\nplans at the last minute.\nAgain hear me out, I\u2019m not a\nmonster \u2013 if something big is\nhappening and my support is\ntruly needed as a friend, if the\nperson I\u2019m meeting is already\nen route, if we have tickets to\nsomething or we\u2019re meeting\nto do something specific and\nlong-planned, then I will be\nthere. However, sometimes\nthat we don\u2019t endure this interaction that will be making me\nincreasingly tense and probably grumpy \u2013 not exactly\nideal properties in a friend.\nBut this is just not socially\nacceptable to say. Unless you\nhave exclusively excellent,\nself-care respecting friends,\nyou\u2019re going to come up\nagainst some hostility if you\nbail on drinks because you\njust want to be alone. If\nyou\u2019re not being called out\nto your face, you can almost\nguarantee that behind the\nscenes there\u2019s some passive\naggressive bitching about\nyour unreliability.\nIf you ask anyone in strong\nopposition to flaking, they will\n\\\\ Or maybe you\njust recognise that\nwhat you really\nneed to do is to go\nhome and catch up\non some Netflix or\ndo whatever you\nwant to do, either\nway you\u2019re an adult,\nand if you don\u2019t\nwant to hang out\nwith someone, you\ndon\u2019t have to \\\\\nthen, I\u2019m not gonna, and it\u2019s\nreally not a reflection of our\nfriendship, but a reflection of\nhow I am feeling right then.\nMaybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re\noverbooked that week\nbecause you don\u2019t like to say\nno or because something\ncame up that\u2019s eating into\nyour time. Or maybe you just\nrecognise that what you really\nneed to do is to go home and\ncatch up on some Netflix. Or\ndo some problem sheets. Or\nto chat to your housemates\nor to do whatever you want\nto do.

Another eight have\nbeen confirmed missing.\nOn Wednesday soldiers\nwere put on guard outside\nBuckingham Palace and\nDowning Street after Theresa\nMay said another attack may\nbe \u201cimminent\u201d.\nAlthough the President and\nthe Provost reassured members\nof Imperial that there is no\nreason to suspect any specific\nthreat to our institution or other\nuniversities, it also warned the\nImperial community \u201cto remain\nvigilant and to immediately\nreport anything suspicious to\nSecurity\u201d.\nA College spokesperson\nsaid new security measures\nwill include \u201cincreasing both\nthe number of patrols and the\nnumber of officers stationed\nin public areas around the\ncampuses. We are also\nworking closely with our\nneighbours to enhance safety\nand security in the surrounding\nareas as well as on campus.\u201d\nCollege urges students\nwho have been affected to\ncontact their personal tutors,\nsupervisors, senior tutors or\nthe College tutors at any point.\nFor staff, free confidential help\nis available from Confidential\nCare 24 hours a day, by\ntelephone (0800 085 4764)\nor online.\nLef Apostolakis\nI\nt might have taken a\nfreedom of information\nrequest but we found\nout how much the new\nCentral Library air-con is\ngoing to cost. And while\nwe were at it we thought we\u2019d\nask for the cost of every single\nrefurbishment the Library\nhas undergone since 2004.\nBecause nobody keeps secrets\nfrom felix (and also because\nCollege is only requested by\nlaw to keep data for up to 12\nyears).\nStarting from the top. The\nLibrary\u2019s single biggest\nexpense still on record is the\nCentral Library Reimaging,\nwhich will see the Installation\nof \u201cchillers\u201d on the roof and\nmight help reduce face-melting\ntemperatures. But we already\nknew it cost a fortune (\u00a311\nmillion to be precise) since it\ntook a decade of complaints,\nplummeting NSS scores and\nBrexit for College to commit\nto improving the single most\nused space on campus.\nThis is the Central Library\u2019s\nsingle largest expenditure in\nrecent recorded history. The\nattempt to please overheating\nstudents is costing more than\nall refurbishments the Central\nLibrary has undergone over\nthe last decade.\nThe second and third\nmost notable \u2018Treat Yo Self\u2019\nmoment in recent memory\nwere (collectively) the 2008\nrefurbishments which cost\n\u00a310.4 million.\nThe ground floor, which\nback in the day housed a\nWaterstones (oh yes) and the\nScience Museum Library, was\nmerged into the old walkway\nand became the Library Cafe\nand the group study area\ndotted with cosy think tanks.\nThe Haldane Collection (also\nknown as the Humanities\ncollection of the Central\nLibrary) which used to sit in\nthe north side of the library\nwas evicted and replaced by\nthe Wolfson IT Learning Suite\n(prime napping spot).\nThis project also marks the\nbeginning of the \u201cair-con\ncurse\u201d. The dimensions of\nthe rooms which were meant\nto house the ground floor\nair conditioning units were\ndifferent to the ones in the\noriginal plans. As the units\nare built according to the\nspecifications of the room\nthey\u2019re housed in, considering\nthe specs meant the Library\nre-opening was pushed back\nthree months to July, after\nsummer exams. To avoid\ndrilling noises revising students\nwere at the time advised to\nstudy at higher levels, which\nhowever had started reaching\nintolerable temperatures. All\nin all not much has changed\nsince 2008.\nThe fourth splurgiest\nmoment since the Athens\nOlympics was the 2015 Level\n2 Development which saw the\nScience Museum library being\nonce again evicted and the\ncreation of additional student\nstudy spaces on Level 3. This\ncost \u00a3350,000.\nFinally, last place on our Top\nFive and personal favourite\n(in fact the main reason\nbehind this FOI) Is the Library\nMain Entrance Vestibule\n(commonly referred to as \u201cthe\nfucking Library doors\u201d). The\nfoyer enclosing the Central\nLibrary\u2019s main entrance was\nconstructedinjustoveramonth\nand was meant to Improve\nclimate control and conserve\nenergy. It\u2019s unclear whether\nit\u2019s achieved these goals,\nbut it\u2019s certainly increased\nstudent frustration and might\neven have something to do\nwith the mental health crisis\nfacing higher education. We\nare finally proud to reveal that\nthe Library doors outside the\nLibrary doors cost \u00a3143,000.\nOther notable expenditures\ninclude two decoration\nprojects (one in 2008 and one\nin 2013) which cumulatively\ncost \u00a318,000 and \u00a3192,000\nflushed down the toilets. Oh\nand wind catchers worth\n\u00a375,000 in 2004, but even\nour Millennials editor, Tessa\nDavey, who\u2019s been at Imperial\nfor almost a decade wasn\u2019t\naround back then to tell us if\nthey successfully cooled down\nthe Library, so I guess we\u2019ll\nnever know.\nAnd now that you know\nhow much that snazzy study\nspace we call home has cost,\nstop trying to smuggle in pot\nnoodles.\n\u201cWait. How much did library doors cost?!\u201d \\\\ felix\nMentality launches new survey\nT\nwo years after its\nlaunch, Mentality is\nconducting another\nsurvey to gain\ninsight into stress\nandmentalhealthat\nImperial. The survey will close\nat the end of June, with results\nexpected to be published by\nthe end of term. According\nto Mentality chair Ariana\nSadr-Hashemi, the previous\nreport focused on getting\nImperial-specific statistics on\nwhat mental health issues are\nmost prominent in the student\nbody and measuring general\nattitudes to mental health.\n\u201cThis survey is more\ncampaign-oriented, aimed\nat finding out in detail what\nstudents use what mental\nhealth services, both college\nand NHS ones, and what their\nexperiences were so we can\ncampaign for improvements,\u201d\nsays Sadr-Hashemi.\nThe survey will also\ninvestigate whether there has\nbeen a significant change\nif any, in the prevalence of\nmental health issues within the\nstudent body since 2015.\nThe initial survey which\nwas conducted in 2015\nresulted in a report with\nseveral key findings and\nrecommendations. According\nto Mentality, 20% of\nrespondents at the time stated\nthat they had been diagnosed\nwith a mental illness, and a\nfurther 40% of respondents\nfelt that they didn\u2019t have\na mental illness but had\nexperienced mental stresses.\nIn addition, 69.5% of Imperial\nstudents surveyed reported\nfeeling stressed at least once\na week. In comparison an\nNUS wide study reported\n31% of respondents feeling\nthe same way. The report\nalso highlighted the key role\nof academic pressure in the\npropagation of stress.\nThis time the survey hopes\nto reveal what services\npeople use to get support and\ntheir positive and negative\nexperiences with each\nindividual service. Mentality\nare hoping this will shed more\nlight on what needs to be\ncampaigned for and where\nmost of the focus needs to go.\nA link to the survey can be\nfound on the Union website.\nEEE Library to close at the end of term\nLef Apostolakis\nT\nhe Electrical\nand Electronic\nE n g i n e e r i n g\nlibrary, one of\nonly a handful\nof departmental\nlibraries remaining in the\nSouth Ken Campus, will\nbe turned into a study\nspace over the course of\nthe summer. Departmental\nFacilities Manager for the\nEEE department, Andy Paice\ntold felix that following\nconsultations with the students\nand as part of a larger\ndevelopment taking place at\nthe EEE building the teaching\noffice will be moving where\nthe EEE library currently\nresides, and the vacant space\nwill be turned into a study\narea.\nAccording to Angela\nGoldfinch, EEE liaison\nlibrarian departmental\nlibraries were gradually\nabsorbed into Central Library\nover a prolonged period of\ntime. Library spaces within the\nFaculty of Engineering were\nclosed/redeveloped back in\n2009 with the agreement of\nthe Faculty. Where agreed,\nphysicalstock(books,journals,\netc) was absorbed into the\nCentral Library collection and\nsubject support staff moved\ninto Central Library (but were\nstill accessible to students\nand staff).

    "content": "16 felixonline.co.uk/culture culture.felix@ic.ac.uk Friday 26 May 2017\nfelix C U L T U R E\nCourse\nCorrection |\nDoctor Who\nAnurag Deshpande\nH\nalfway into the\nlatest season of\nDoctor Who,\nset to be Peter\nCapaldi and\nshowrunner\nSteven Moffat\u2019s last, we have\nyet to be disappointed. After\na rocky few seasons, the\nshow began to show signs of\nrecovery with last Christmas\u2019\ndelightful, superhero themed\nfix. The first six episodes of\nseries ten have continued\nthis upward trend, with new\ncompanion Bill proving to be\nquite a highlight, and Capaldi\nbeing allowed to flourish.\nFinally, we get to see\nCapaldi\u2019s Doctor come\ntogether in a coherent way.\nMoffat has now established a\nfirm grip on the 12th\nDoctor\u2019s\npersonality; rough around\nthe edges, but not unkind\nor mean-spirited as he often\nseemed in previous series.\nThis Doctor is now more of a\nFagin or Willy Wonka figure.\nIt\u2019s just a shame that this shift\nin characterisation comes just\nas Capaldi is set to leave. The\nunique choice to make our\nprotagonist blind, albeit we\ncan infer temporarily, also\naffords Peter Capaldi the\nopportunity to flex his acting\nmuscle.\nIn fact, one must commend\nMoffat on the choice to\nseemingly make the Doctor\u2019s\nblindness a running plot\npoint. Given that the show\u2019s\nlong history, it always runs\nthe risk of repeating itself. This\nnew development, however,\noffers a range of intriguing\nnarrative possibilities to the\nwriters. Whether or not these\nare seized fully, remains to be\nseen. So far, at least, it has\nbeen used in interesting ways.\nAnother welcome change\nis the fresh dynamic between\nDoctor and companion. Over\nthe past half-decade or so,\nviewers have grown increasingly frustrated by Moffat\u2019s\nneed to make female companions fawn romantically\nover our lead. Thankfully,\nthis season instead opts for\na much more interesting\nstudent-teacher dynamic. This\nactually calls back to earlier\nDoctors, and returns the\nshow to its roots somewhat.\nStill, it is a dynamic we have\nseen far too little of since the\nseries\u2019 revival, and so offers\na necessary reprieve from the\nconstant lovesickness Doctor\nWho has taken to wallowing\nin recently. This treatment\nThis is why you always wear a seatbelt\n\\\\ BBC\nenhances the Doctor\u2019s larger\nthan life nature, and makes\nthe audience too feel like\nthey\u2019re along for the TARDIS\nride.\nCentral to the success of\nthis new dynamic, of course,\nis the new companion, Bill.\nPearl Mackie\u2019s turn as the\nDoctor\u2019s latest accompaniment is a tour-de-force.\nMackie brings a youthful\nenergy, and refreshing\nperspective to the show that,\nin retrospect, it had really\nbeen lacking. It helps that\nshe feels more grounded and\nself-aware than some previous companions. Also worth\nnoting is that Bill Potts is the\nDoctor\u2019s first openly gay com-panion. Here, again, Steven\nMoffat deserves credit, as her\nsexuality is handled with relative grace and poise. While it\nis certainly commented upon\nperiodically, it does not ever\nfeel like an afterthought or a\ntokenisation. Bill\u2019s love life is\ntreated with as much respect\nand comedy as previous\ncompanions\u2019.\nAnother of the strengths\nof this season is that each\nepisode is relatively self-con-tained, and there doesn\u2019t yet\nseem to be the sort of overuse\nof continuity that had become\nendemic of the last few years.\nThe decision to use new monsters of the week keeps things\nexciting, and also solves the\npower creep problem for\nclassic villains by using them\nsparingly. Additionally, while\nthe plots in the season so far\nhave been relatively straight\nforward, they have been\nexceedingly\nThinker, Teacher, Doctor, Spy \\\\ BBC\nwell executed. This excuses\nmuch of the, admittedly\ninevitable, recycling of villain\nconcepts, too. Subtle variations also help this; zombies\nbecome Capitalist Space\nZombies. Worth special\nmention is David Suchet\u2019s\nunnerving appearance as The\nLandlord.\nNaturally, the season\nhasn\u2019t been without its faults.\nMostly the typical issues that\nplague Who, a bit too much\ncheese here and there, and\nobvious twists. A commendable exception to the latter\ntrend however, was found in\nthe season\u2019s sixth episode,\n\u2018Extremis\u2019. The episode\u2019s\nA-plot was very unique as\n\\\\ I only wish\nCapaldi could\nhave been allowed\nto settle into this\nvery comfortable\ngroove earlier. If\nonly we could turn\nback time \\\\\nfar as concepts explored\nin Doctor Who go, and its\ngenuinely bleak moments\nwere sobering. This is all\ndespite the tenuously linked,\nalthough quite well acted\nand funny, segments with the\nMaster. There is a risk that as\nwe flow into the second half\nof the season with this plot-line, we will once again fall\ninto the trap of circle-jerking\ncontinuity too hard. However,\ndespite it seemingly being the\nmain plotline for the current\nseason, Moffat has managed\nto keep it appropriately\nrestrained.\nThis season has been a\nnoticeable improvement compared to\nthe last few, and I\nactually look forward to watching\nnew episodes\nof Who again. I\nhope this trend\ncontinues through\nthe back half of\nthe season. I only\nwish Capaldi could\nhave been allowed to\nsettle into this very comfortable groove earlier. If\nonly we could turn back time.\n\\\\ Another of the\nstrengths of this\nseason is that each\nepisode is relatively\nself-contained \\\\\n\n"

Maybe you had\na paper to submit tomorrow. You thought you had everything under\ncontrol. You were halfway there but you made the mistake of taking\na break and committing to an episode of the Great British Bake Off.\nSix hours later you get a text from your coursemate asking you what\nreference you used for a thing you haven\u2019t even heard of. You look\nat the time and have a mini heart episode. You get up from the sofa, the sudden\nmovement giving you head-rush, take a deep breath and make the only decision\nthat makes sense at 1 a.m. on a Thursday. You go to the Central Library.\nWe\u2019ve all been there. Some of us more than once. Frankly if you haven\u2019t\npulled an all-nighter in the library do you even go here? Still the Central Library\ngets transformed into a magical realm, littered with candy wrappers, populated by orphan lecture notes. If you keep still you might get approached by a\nsleep-deprived undergrad, desperately looking for a functioning toilet. Who are\nthese study-machines who power the Central Library\u2019s afterhours sessions? Are\nthey victims of circumstance? Are they bad time-managers? Are they the overly\nkeen, the serial night owls, the best people you will ever know? How do they do\nit and what wisdom do they have to impart on us? We decided to find out and\nreveal their secrets.\nWe arrived at our destination just after twelve. As any seasoned Imperial student\nwill know, at eleven all College study spaces shut and students are thrown out of\ntheir departments, leaving the desperate with only one option: the Central Library.\nBy twelve, everyone has settled in, got their snacks spread out, had a little cry\nmaybe and is probably three chapters deep in revision. Clearly that\u2019s the best time\nto be interrupted.\nWe started with the ground\nfloor and made our way up.\nWe\u2019d start with the group\nstudy areas and build our\nconfidence up until we\nreached the silent study\nfloors.\nThe first guy we bumped\ninto was Andy Whitfield, a\nMetals and Energy Finance\nMasters student who was\nsurprisingly chatty.\nWhy are you not home\nworking?\nI concentrate better here. It\nforces me to work \u2013 there\nare too many distractions at\nhome.\nWhat is your relationship with\nthe library?\nI hate it, it\u2019s a terrible place!\nNo, it\u2019s a good facility really.\nI\u2019d just rather be somewhere\nelse: asleep right now.\nWhat is the longest amount of\ntime you have ever spent in\nthe library?\nProbably twelve hours.\nHow do you get through it?\nMusic, or I go out on my bike\nand ride around London for\nhalf an hour and wake up a\nbit.\nWhat about snacks and\ndrinks?\nMini cheddars and I don\u2019t\nreally drink coffee although\nI did bring pro plus with me\ntoday but I haven\u2019t had it yet.\nWhat sort of person do you\nthink you have to be to come\nhere for an all-nighter?\nThere are some who just\ncome here for fun and enjoy\nit. One guy on my course\njust enjoys working in the\nmiddle of the night. He would\nrather sleep all day and work\nthrough the night.\nThat\u2019s not me \u2013 this is just a\nlast minute thing.\nLet\u2019s talk hygiene. Tell us\nabout the toilers.\nThey\u2019re fucking horrible in\nImperial. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s\nwrong with this place. I\u2019ve\nspent four years in central\nAfrica working on a mine and\nthe toilets there were better\nthan the ones at Imperial.\nHow would you describe\nyourself?\nLaid-back. Too laid-back\napparently as I left this all to\nthe last minute.\nWe thanked Andy and\nwished him good luck. We\nsaid we\u2019d come back to check\nup on him. We lied.\nNext we cornered someone\non his way back to his group.\nHe didn\u2019t see us coming.\nActually he did and was\nreally cool about sparing\nfive minutes to talk to us. But\nwe managed to mess up the\nrecording so we\u2019ll never know\nwhat this beautiful stranger\nhad to say.\nWe then decided we should\nprobably move on and harass\npeople on other floors. But\nnot before intruding the\nprivacy of one of those weird\nlittle study cubes and force\nShafakat Bashir, a Chemical\nEngineering Masters student\nto talk to us\nIs this your first all-nighter?\nIt\u2019s not my first no. I can\u2019t\nrevise during the day as there\nis no space in the library. So\nI sleep during the day and\nrevise all night.\nHow many all-nighters have\nyou done?\nLoads. Even when I\u2019m not\nrevising I\u2019d come in the\nmorning at about five o\u2019clock\njust before lectures and do six\nhours \u2013 do my lectures and\nthen go home. During the day\nthere is too much distraction\nand the library is quite busy\nas well. It\u2019s always hot. At this\ntime you can revise at your\nown pace and it\u2019s quiet \u2013 and\nit all goes in.\nIs there any sort of routine\nyou have when you revise?\nIf I understand something and\nI\u2019m just practicing something\nthen I listen to music. If I don\u2019t\nthen it\u2019s a distraction.\nYou\u2019ve got a very large bottle\nof water there but do you\never have any other drinks or\nsnacks?\nNo, if I have sugar I feel\nsleepy and go home. So, I\nstay away from sugar and\nfoods. I just have the big\nbottle of water. It goes, it lasts\nme the night. I don\u2019t do any\nrefills \u2013 I can\u2019t drink London\nwater, I\u2019m from Leeds.\nHow much do you spend on\nbottled water a year?\nThis bottle is 50 pence and I\nhave two bottles a day proba-bly. About \u00a37 a week. When\nyou think about it it\u2019s quite a\nbit.\nWhat about toilets and\nhygiene?\nThey have their ups and\ndowns. Lately, the toilets in\nthe library have been out of\norder. There\u2019s always been\nstuff clogged in the toilets and\nshit around the bowl \u2013 it's\nkind of off-putting.\nWhat kind of person do you\nthink you need to be to do\nall-nighters in the library?\nWhat kind of person are you?\nBecause I\u2019ve moved here\nfrom a different part of the\ncountry and don\u2019t really know\nanyone where I live the only\nsocial aspect of my life is at\nuniversity. If you\u2019ve got a very\nsocial and active life, it\u2019s a bit\nmore difficult to do all-night-ers. If you\u2019re living secluded\naway from student areas\nit\u2019s a bit more dull \u2013 you\u2019re\na lot more likely to study,\nespecially at this time. If it's a\nThursday, Friday or Saturday\nnight and you\u2019re a student\nand you wanna get wrecked\nyou\u2019re not going to come to\nthe library.\nAfter wasting a good fifteen\nminutes of Shafakat\u2019s time we\nreluctantly decided to let him\ngo back to his big old bottle\nof water and make our way\nto the second floor to tackle a\nsilent study area.\nWe tried talking to a good\nsix or seven students on the\nsecond floor. Luckily Fabiola\nMann, a first year medic, took\npity on us before we lost all\nour remaining morale.\nHow many all-nighters have\nyou done?\nNot that many, I try to avoid\nthem when I can.\nIs this an all-nighter?\nNo, I\u2019m probably going to\ngo to bed in the next hour\nhopefully.\nHow do you feel about the\nlibrary?\nIt\u2019s pretty good. It\u2019s a nice\nenvironment. I get a lot more\ndone here than I do in my\nroom. It\u2019s good to have a\nconstant place to work in \u2013 it\nkinda gets you in the zone.\nWhat's the longest time\nyou\u2019ve ever spent in the\nlibrary?\nProbably about nine hours\nduring the day.\nSo you\u2019re not really a night\nowl then?\nWell I am but I\u2019m trying to\nsleep earlier. That\u2019s not going\nwell because exams are\ncoming up.\nWhat\u2019s the weirdest thing you\nhave ever seen in the library?\nThere was fire drill at 1AM. It\nwas weird, we were just chilling outside. There were 50-60\npeople and that was during\nthe Easter break.\nWhat about snacks?\nThe vending machine\ndownstairs has my favourite\nchocolate bar \u2013 Snack bar.\nIt tastes a bit like chocolate\nfingers.\n...and drinks?\nMochas or diet cokes or\nwaters if I\u2019m planning on\nsleeping.\nHow would you describe the\nsort of person who spends\na lot of time in the library at\nnight?\nCramming.\nSo that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing?\nNo, I\u2019ve got a month and a\nbit before my exam but I feel\nbehind. I just kind of wanted\nto get ahead.\nWhat\u2019s your relationship with\nstress?\nHighs and lows. Generally at\na high I\u2019ll come to the library.\nAnything else you would like\nto add?\nI just really like this space.\nAs we bid Fabiola farewell,\nCale pointed out people\ncome here because they want\nno distractions and that we\u2019re\nhella distracting.\nSo we decided to cut our\nlosses and move on. As we\narrived to the third floor,\nanother silent study floor, we\nwere overtaken by dread as\nwe thought about all the students we\u2019d once again have\nto bother to be done with\nthis article. Then a structural\nengineer popped out of the\nloo and we snatched him and\nasked him to step out for a\nsec to answer some questions.\nAfter spelling his name for us\nAngel Ruizdelarbol told us all\nabout his relationship with the\nlibrary.\nAre you gonna spend the\nwhole night here?\nNo one more hour.\nHow often do you do that?\nEvery day. I study here and in\nSkempton. I prefer working at\nnights especially now that I no\nlonger have lectures.\nWhat\u2019s the longest time\nyou\u2019ve spent in the library?\nIn one sitting between Skempton and here \u2013 today for\nexample I had an exam \u2013 I\u2019ll\nbe in the library from 2 p.m.\nto 2 a.m. So twelve hours.\nThat\u2019s a lot of hours. What do\nyou do for snacks and drinks?\nI bring stuff from home nor-mally. Or go to Wasabi.\nAnd what about the loos?\nIt\u2019s not fine. Normally\u2026 Not\nfine.\nWhat\u2019s the most horrifying\nthing you\u2019ve seen in the\ntoilets?\nReally? You want to know\nthat? Blood\u2026 piss [He said\njokingly. We presume.]\nWhat kind of person are you?\nWhat kind of person do you\nneed to be to study so much\nat the library?\nI\u2019m a happy person, a stressful person.\nHow do you deal with stress?\nI study. It\u2019s better than going\nhome and watching TV series.\nI prefer to study in the library.\nAt home I can\u2019t concen-trate, I just watch Netflix or\nsomething.\nAngel laughed throughout our chat. It was unclear\nwhether he was truly finding\nthe interview entertaining,\nwhether he was using laughter to hide the pain that\nusually comes with spending\ntwelve hours straight in the\nlibrary, or whether he was\nabout to flip out and do a\ndouble murder on us. So we\nlet him go and went up a level\nwhere we met a chemeng\nstudent that preferred to stay\nanonymous.\nAre you spending the whole\nnight here?\nI think so. This is the second\nor third time I\u2019m doing an\nall-nighter.\nHow do you find it?\nI think it\u2019s quite peaceful here\nat night. I love it when there\u2019s\nnot a lot of people around. It\nwould be great if there were\nmore beds, I mean couches,\nyou know places to nap.\nProtip: check out the ground\nfloor computer room.\nYeah I\u2019m thinking of going\nthere later tonight.\nHow many hours have you\nspent here straight?\nProbably twelve hours plus.\nI can\u2019t really remember but\ndefinitely at least twelve\nhours.\nWhy are you not home\nworking?\nI used to stay home to study\nbut recently I found a study\nbuddy so I come here to\nstudy with him and I think it\u2019s\na great place to come for a\nmeet up.\nYou have any snacks you\nenjoy during your sessions?\nAh, a Snickers bar? I don\u2019t\nknow. A Kinder Bueno bar.\nOnce. I don\u2019t usually have\nany snacks or coffee, but I do\ndrink a lot of water.\nLet\u2019s talk hygiene and toilets.\nI think the situation could be\nimproved. Not much else to\nsay. I don\u2019t mind using them, I\ncan generally tolerate it.\nWhat kind of person are you?\nHow do you deal with stress?\nI generally don\u2019t mix with\npeople much, but recently\nI found a close friend. Late\nat night you\u2019ll probably find\nhardcore studying people\nhere. During the day I usually go to sleep or to lectures\nand tutorials. If I have to. As\nfor stress, I was really stressed\ntill I found a buddy.\nAnything else you\u2019d like to\nadd?\nI haven\u2019t seen a mouse in the\nlibrary but I hope to see one\nsoon.\nOn that note we thought it\nmight be time to head off. So\nwe finally made our way to\nthe fifth floor where we were\nmet with super keen biology\nnewbie and all-nighter expert\nGunay Arcan.\nHave you done this before?\nYes many times. I have a\ntutorial for tomorrow. Usually\nI\u2019ll leave the tutorial sheet till\nthe last minute and I\u2019ll have\nto stay up all night. I do this\nabout three times a week\n[laughs awkwardly]. I think I\nhave insomnia.\nWhat\u2019s the longest time\nyou\u2019ve spent at the library?\nProbably from eight in the\nevening till eight at night.\nTwelve hours.\nWhat\u2019s your routine?\nI don\u2019t bring food with me\nbut I drink a lot of water and\nusually take breaks to go the\ntoilet. But I don\u2019t have anything to eat usually.\nSo that\u2019s not yours? [pointing\nat some sort of wrapper\ntucked under a computer]\nYeah I ate that [laughs].\nWhy are on the fifth floor?\nIt\u2019s so hot here. I mean you\u2019re\nbasically in your underwear.\nIs it? Well when I got here\nit was around 6 p.m. so it\nwasn\u2019t that cold. I always\nchoose the fifth floor \u2018cos the\nleast people come here so it\u2019s\nnot very busy.\nWhat\u2019s the weirdest thing\nyou\u2019ve seen in the library?\nMice, there\u2019s a lot of mice. I\nhave videos of them. They\u2019re\neverywhere.\nTalks to us about the toilets\nand how you deal with them.\nThey're not good. They smell\nbad. I\u2019ve just been and they\nare not clean. It doesn\u2019t\nbother me too much because\nI have to study here. I can\u2019t\nconcentrate in my room so I\nhave to stand it.\nThe fifth floor has a reputation\nfor boning. Have you ever\nseen anyone get it on here?\nI\u2019ve never seen anything. I\nsee girls sitting on the laps of\nboys sometimes kissing but\nnothing more. Sometimes the\nguard making rounds spots\nthem and asks them to stop.\nHe\u2019ll say \u201cthe Library is a\npublic space.\u201d\nWhat kind of person are you?\nI\u2019m a night owl and I do stress\na lot. I always leave the work\ntill the very last day and I\ndon\u2019t learn from my mistakes.\nThis is why I\u2019m here right now.\nI don\u2019t revise properly every\nday, I leave it till the last\nminute.\nHow\u2019s that working out for\nyou?\nIt\u2019s not working out. I\nmanaged to survive my first\nexams but it\u2019s not going to\nwork now I think. My next\nexam is in late June but I\u2019ll\nleave it till mid June before I\nstart revising.\nSo you\u2019ve already predicted\nyour failure?\n[laughs]\nFeeling a lot more care-free\nafter our conversation with\nGunay we started our decent\nback down to the Ground\nFloor. We were about to\nleave when we decided to\ntalk to one last person before\ncalling it a night. Mobolaji\nAdekanmbi who was on duty\nat the main desk. We talked\nfor quite a while but we\u2019ve\nboiled our conversation down\nto two key questions:\nTell us about your relationship\nwith food and drink.\nOh\u2026 We encourage students\nto eat food at the cafe or\nleave it outside, but some\nwill try and sneak it inside.\nStudents complain about\nfood smells and we have to\ntell students that cooked food\nisn\u2019t allowed in the library.\nStudents will eat and keep it\nunder the table. When you\ngo around you\u2019ll see it but\nyou don\u2019t\u2019 know who\u2019s it is.\nSome students will sneak in\npizza. Some people come\nwith electric water boilers\n[kettles] to make coffee. But\nobviously that\u2019s not allowed in\nthe library.\nHave you ever caught people\nmaking out or boning in the\nlibrary?\nAt night we never experience\nthat. Apart from one time,\nthere were some students in\nthe ladies toilets and that got\nreported. The person [who\nreported it] heard the voice of\na few people, girls and boys\nin the toilets but he didn\u2019t see\nthem do anything, he didn\u2019t\nestablish the fact. We spoke\nto the student and I think he\nsaid she celebrated her birthday and was trying to give\nher boyfriend a special treat.\nYou have a house, you should\nhave gone to the house\ninstead of the toilets!\nDamn straight.\nLef Apostolakis & Cale Tilford\n\n"

This\nmeans that shortlisted staff\nhave been nominated and\nshortlisted by students.\nAccording to Deputy\nPresident (Education), Luke\nMcCrone, this makes the\nSACAs extremely valuable.\n\u201cIt is a widely held belief that\nthe repository of data we\ngenerate through SACAs is\nabout the best indication of\n\u2018teaching quality/excellence\u2019\nthat we can get our hands\non \u2013 the direct, untampered\nviews of our students who\nvoluntarily come forward to\nspeak out about best practise,\u201d\nsays McCrone. \u201cThis data will\ninevitably lay the necessary\nfoundation from which we\ncan innovate educationally\nin future, including as part of\nthe Learning and Teaching\nstrategy.\u201d\nLooking at the outcomes of\ntheSACAs,aproblemthatVice\nProvost for Education, Simone\nBuitendijk has repeatedly\nexpressed becomes evident \u2013\nthe student experience varies\nwidely across faculties and\ndepartments. This year for\nexample, while most awards\nwere given to members of\nthe faculty of engineering,\nthe faculty of natural sciences\nmanaged to snag a couple\nand the faculty of medicine\nalso took home one (the\ndepartment of bioengineering\nwas the only department to\nbag two awards).\nHowever, the faculty of\nengineering has consistently\ndominated the awards. Since\ntheir establishment in 2012,\nmembers of the faculty have\nreceived over half of all\nawards. Out of the 40 SACAs\nawarded over the last five\nyears, only a quarter of all\nSACAs have been awarded\nto natural scientists while\nmembers from the department\nof medicine have only received\nsix. The Business School and\nthe Centre for Languages,\nCulture and Communication\n(home to Horizons and the\nScience Communication Unit)\nhave only taken an award\nhome once so far (which,\nconsidering their size, is quite\nan achievement).\nTo an extent this is to\nbe expected. 45% of all\nstudents at Imperial are\nengineering students, whereas\napproximately a third and a\nquarter are natural scientists\nand medics respectively.\nHowever, the award\ndistribution also reflects\nthe NSS results. With the\nexception of the department of\nmathematics, natural sciences\nand medicine typically\nperform poorly at the NSS\nsurvey. The crux of Imperial\nseems to be assessment and\nfeedback with just over 40%\nof physicists last year agreeing\nthat they were happy with the\nquality of assessment and\nfeedback they received.\nThough numerous voices\nat Imperial have repeatedly\nexpressed that NSS scores\nare not the be-all and end-all,\nthe dissatisfaction they reveal\nseems to come up at every\nopportunity.\nIn the case of the President\u2019s\nAwards too, distinctions are\ndisproportionately awarded\nto members of the Faculty of\nEngineering.\nIn Education, excellence is\nrecognised across teaching,\npastoral care, research\nsupervision and support\nof the student experience.\nTwenty staff members\nwere recognised across all\ncategories with over half of\nthem occupying roles within\nthe Faculty of Engineering.\nAnother 16 awards were\ngiven for research. Engineers\ndominated again, gathering\nnine distinctions, whereas the\nfaculties of Natural Sciences\nand Medicine took home\nfour distinctions each (one\ndistinction was joint between\nfaculties).\nLooking at the winners lists\navailable online, it is evident\nthat this is a consistent pattern.\nBoth in 2016 and 2015,\nengineers received half or\nmore of all awards.\n\\\\ Out of the 40\nSACAs awarded\nover the last five\nyears, only a\nquarter of all SACAs\nhave been awarded\nto natural scientists,\nwhile members from\nthe department of\nmedicine have only\nreceived six \\\\\nTake part in felix\u2019s very un-scientific poll at:\nfelixonline.co.uk/go/ge2017survey\nMost of the award winners were from the Faculty of Engineering \\\\ Imperial College Union\nPhysics flops in league tables\nOh how the mighty have fallen. NOT Joanna Wormald\nI\nmperial is regularly\ndeclared one of the best\nuniversities in the world.\nThe latest Guardian\nuniversity league tables\nreaffirms this, placing\nus in joint 6th\nplace overall.\nImperial ranked top in Earth\nand Marine Sciences, Civil\nEngineering, Electronic and\nElectrical Engineering, and\nEngineering (general).\nPhysics however was a\ndifferent story. Last year,\nPhysics retained its place in 8th\nposition. The 2018 rankings\nsee it plummet to 30th.\nWhy have we fallen so far so\nfast? Statistics provided by the\nGuardian over the past three\nyears don\u2019t make for happy\nreading. The overall score\nawarded to Imperial fell from\n86.3 out of 100 in 2017 to a\nlowly 57.2 this year. Scores\nare calculated from a range\nof metrics, largely taken from\nthe National Student Survey\n(NSS), which measure not\nonly what benefits graduates\ngain but also how much the\nuniversity puts into the course.\nThe Department of\nPhysics has maintained\n\\\\ We certainly\ndon\u2019t think this drop\nin rankings is a true\nreflection of the\nquality of the\ncourse \\\\\nexpenditure per student and\nthe student:staff ratio has\nremained reasonably steady\nat 11.0. Yet overall satisfaction\nhas dropped for the second\nyear in a row, from 86% in\n2017 to just 68% this year. This\nseems more an effect of exams\nand coursework (assessment\nsatisfaction has dropped 20\npercentage points to 42%)\nand less a result of poor\nteaching quality \u2014 teaching\nsatisfaction is only down seven\npercentage points at 82%.\nStrong teaching may be\nwhy achieving a 1st\nor 2:1\nis considered slightly easier\nnow. That\u2019s according to\nthe \u2018value-added\u2019 score,\nwhich has fallen to 4/10.\nThis piece of \u201csophisticated\nindexing methodology\u201d\nmeasures how difficult it is\nfor students to graduate with\ngood degrees based on their\nentry qualifications. A low\nvalue-added score indicates\nit is easier to get that all-essential 2:1 or above. It\u2019s\nunclear whether this year\u2019s\nlower score is a positive or\nnegative thing \u2014 a higher\nnumber of students achieving\na good degree could have a\ndevaluing effect. Concerns\namong students that their\ndegree might be perceived\nas worth less are mitigated\nby doubts that employers\nhave sufficient knowledge\nto compare the difficulty of\ncompleting a Physics degree\nat different institutions.\nCurrently the Guardian\nleague table indicates 85%\nof physicists find graduate-level work or further study\nafter six months. Yet students\nremain optimistic, hoping the\ntransferable skills they gain\nwill be viewed well and boost\ntheir career prospects.\nWhether the results are fair\nor accurate is a different story.\n\u201cIt strikes me that [the rankings]\nare more a measure of how\nmuch students enjoyed the\ncourse rather than how good\nthe course is academically,\u201d\nsays first-year Cameron\nHughes, though he adds\nthat \u201cgenerally satisfaction\nisn\u2019t great, particularly for\nfeedback.\u201d\nWhat about College\u2019s own\nleague table analysis? It\nis keen to note that unlike\nother domestic league tables,\nthe Guardian dismisses\nresearch-related metrics\nas unimportant. Imperial\ndisagrees, implying we\nwould rank higher had these\nmeasurements been included.\nIn the spirit of intercollegiate\nrivalry, the analysis highlights\nwhere Imperial has beaten\nCambridge, Oxford and UCL.\nWhat it neglects to mention\nis UCL didn\u2019t just rank more\nhighly than Imperial in Physics\n\u2014 they replaced us at 8th\nposition. Talk about adding\ninsult to injury.\nSpeaking to Professor\nJordan Nash, Head of the\nDepartment of Physics, it\nseems the rankings weren\u2019t\na surprise. NSS results have\nbeen available from the start\nof the year and a rankings\ndrop was anticipated.\n\u201cWe have been changing\nhow our course is delivered,\u201d\nProfessor Nash explained.\nThese changes in response\nto previous student feedback\nmean last year\u2019s cohort were\nprobably subject to more\ndisruption than other years.\nThe department has \u201ctaken\nvery seriously the results\nof the NSS last year\u201d and\nbeen working to implement\nchanges based on \u201ca number\nof complaints where [the\nDepartment of Physics]\ncertainly agree we can do\nthings better.\u201d\nThe department has\nexamined complaints and\nidentified improvement areas,\nsuch as demonstrations and\nfeedback in labs and tutorials.\nStudents say \u201cit feels like\nour lab reports are marked\nfairly haphazardly.\u201d Students\nreceive different marks\ndespite writing similar things\nto their peers and receive\ncontradictory advice. For\nexample, students told to use\nHarvard referencing in their\nnext lab report were informed\nthey should actually have\nused Vancouver referencing.\nTo remedy this, further training\nwill be provided to members\nof staff involved in labs and\ntutorials.\nAnother source of\nunhappiness was \u201ca small\nnumber of errors in exam\nscripts.\u201d Changes are now\nbeing made to the way in\nwhich exams are prepared\nand checked to reduce future\nerrors.\nAdditionally, extra staff have\nbeen taken on to assist with\nundergraduate administration\nissues. This includes a new\nStudent Liaison Officer to\nbetter support students.\nIt is not expected the league\ntables will adversely affect the\nnumber of future applicants.\nThere are many other rankings\navailable, all drawn from\ndifferent data. Imperial ranks\nvery highly in most of these,\nincluding on career prospects\nand the \u201cscientific excellence\nof the staff\u201d, which are often\nimportant considerations of\nprospective candidates.\nProfessor Nash assures\nus that \u201cas a department\nwe certainly don\u2019t think this\ndrop in rankings is a true\nreflection of the quality of\nthe course we offer, and in\ntalking to our students I also\nget the impression they don\u2019t\nfeel so negatively about the\ndepartment.\u201d He is confident\nresults will improve. Next year\nmay see Imperial reclaim its\nposition towards the top of the\ntable.\nSatisfaction has dropped across the board \\\\ felix\nPhysics Rankings 2016-2018\nTeaching Satisfaction\nCareer Prospects\nOverall Satisfaction\nGuardian Score\nAssessment\nSatisfaction\nPercentage\nYear\n2015 2016 2017\n90%\n100%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n\n"

Sometimes we just\nneed to step away from our\nproblems, and return to them\nwith a fresh mind. Just don\u2019t\ntake it too far. When escaping\nturns into a pathology of\nescapism, you might find you\nhave a problem. You might\nrecognise this as the point\nwhere you\u2019re neglecting all\nyour work, skipping lectures\nand becoming a shut in to\nhave 15-hour sessions of\nLeague of Legends. This could\nbe catalysed from anything\nremotely negative, be it a\npoorly marked lab report,\nrejection from another job\napplication or just a bad day.\nThe key, like most things in\nlife, is to strike a balance and\nmake sure you remember to\nsnap back to reality at the\nright time.\n\u201cHow do I strike a\nbalance?\u201d I hear you ask.\nLet\u2019s start by identifying\nwhen you\u2019re struggling with\nescapism. If you find yourself\nfeeling disdain for the real\nworld and its subjects, and\na need for something better,\nsomething separate to this\nreality you might have a\nproblem. We\u2019re not talking\nabout taking a break or\nseeking some relief. The\nlatter is about building up\nyour energy for something\nimportant as opposed\nto abandoning the real\nworld for a ten-hour-long\nOverwatch session.

You need to sit\ndown and identify the sources\nof stress and upset in your\nlife. And when you\u2019ve done\nthat, think of ways to tackle\nthem one baby step at a time.\nDon\u2019t forget, it\u2019s OK to talk\nto people and ask for help\nwhenever you need it, whatever the obstacle may be. No\none is perfect and most of us\nhave at some point sought out\nsupport. Sometimes a friendly\nvoice is all you need to get\nback on track.\nObviously, if you\u2019ve been\nhit by something major, you\u2019re\nnot going to feel like tackling\nit or thinking about it. But it\nwon\u2019t do you any good to\nshut yourself out altogether\nand use artificial achievements to make up for it. Take\ntime off to feel better and\nget whatever\u2019s bothering you\nout of your system. Then you\nneed to identify when you\u2019re\nready to deal with things and\nget back on your feet.

I initially\nhad my sights on sitting MPs,\nsuch as Andy Slaughter in\nHammersmith, but what with\nthe short term announcement\nof this election, most people\nstill had engagements, so it\nwas a struggle.\u201d\nEdwards and his team\nhave been polling students\nto find out what main issues\nembers of Imperial have on\ntheir minds. Burning questions\nunsurprisingly involve issues\non the NHS, Higher Education,\nand Brexit. However we\nshould expect a discussion on\na range of topics including the\neconomy and job prospects,\nclimate policy, the \u2018Snoopers\u2019\ncharter, research funding,\nimmigration and the housing\ncrisis.\nThe plan is for the event to\ntake the format of Question\nTime, wherein audience\nmembers suggest questions\nbefore going in, and one\nof the chairs presents those\nquestions to the panel.\nOrganisers are still waiting\non clearance for some\nspeakers, though the ones who\nhave been cleared have come\nback with a minimal security\nwarning. It\u2019s safe to assume\ncampus will be kept breezy,\nwith likelihood of protesters at\na minimum.\nThe debate will hopefully\noffer the chance to Imperial\nstudents to be exposed to\ntheir potential democratic\nrepresentatives. \u201cAlthough not\nall of the panel may end up\nwith a seat in the Commons,\u201d\nsays Edwards, \u201csome of them\nare local councillors for wards\nwith a significant student\npopulation, and getting them\nto come to campus to talk with\nstudents is beneficial for both\nstudents and politicians.\u201d\nI\u2019ve been talking to people\nwho are considering not\nvoting as, due to the nature\nof the FPTP system, their vote\nwon\u2019t count in either their\nhome or uni constituency, and\nbeing exposed to the people\nbattling for your vote can\nchange mindsets.\u201d\nIf nothing else, Edwards\nhopes that meaningful\nexposure to students will make\npoliticians think more about\nhow they can pass policy that\nbenefits us as both current\nstudents and future taxpayers.\nNas Andriopoulos who\nwill most likely be chairing\nthe event said \u201cthe London\nForum for Science and Policy\nhave asked me to chair the\nevent and I look forward to\nputting students\u2019 questions to\nthe panel. I would encourage\nvoters to come along, as it will\nbe the perfect opportunity\nfor our members to quiz local\nparty representatives on\nhow their policies will affect\nstudents, STEMM in general as\nwell as wider socioeconomic\nissues. \u201c\nThis year I have been\napolitical and will continue to\ndo so, I will be merely keeping\nthe peace during debate\nand asking the students\u2019\nquestions.\u201d\n\\\\ Meaningful\nexposure to students\nwill make politicians\nthink more about\nhow they can pass\npolicy that benefits\nus as both current\nstudents and future\ntaxpayers \\\\\nMental health related drop-outs on the rise\nLef Apostolakis\nI\nn only five years, the\nnumber of students who\nhave dropped out from\nhigher education has\nquadrupled according\nto data from the Higher\nEducation Statistics Agency\n(HESA). The findings which\nwere highlighted earlier last\nweek by the Guardian, show\nthat just in 2014-15 a record\n1,180 students struggling\nwith mental health left higher\neducation.\nA series of freedom of\ninformation requests by the\nGuardian which managed\nto collect data from over 90\nuniversities echoed these\nreports. The investigation\nfound that just during the\nacademic year of 2015-16, nearly 88,000 students\nrequested counselling, up\n28% from the previous year\nand this demand is only\nincreasing.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether this\ntrend reflects an increase\nin the occurrence of mental\nhealth problems amongst\nuniversity students or whether\nit\u2019s a result of the fight against\nmental health stigmas, the rise\nin awareness of the existence\nof mental health services or\ntrends of over-medicalisation.\nAt Cardiff University for\nexample, the demand for\ncounselling services which\nrose by 96% in the last three\nyears is believed to be down\nto the institution\u2019s campaign to\nencourage students to access\nsupport. At least according to\nBen Lewis, director of student\nsupport and wellbeing.\nAt Imperial according to a\n2015 student survey, 20%\nof students reported a mental\nillness diagnosis, with a further\n40% believing they didn\u2019t\nhave a mental illness but\nhaving experienced mental\nstresses anyway.\nAvailable services here\ninclude the Student Mental\nHealth Advisers (SMHA)\nbut to see one students need\nto be referred by a staff\nmember. Following a referral,\nthe long wait for a suitable\nappointment begins. There is\nno indication of how long this\ntakes on average but many\nstudents reportedly have to\nwait weeks before receiving\nan appointment, during\nwhich time their condition\ncan rapidly deteriorate with\ndangerous effects.\nIn response a pilot scheme\nwas launched at the start of\nthe 2015-2016 academic year,\noffering the option of over-email counselling. Students\nthe referral process is easier (it\ninvolves filling in a registration\nform and questionnaire) and\nif successful leads to an initial\nfour email exchanges with a\ncounsellor. Still the service has\nit\u2019s limitations, including the\ndepth of information that can\nbe conveyed in an email.\nWith overstretched and\nunresponsive mental health\nservices combined with an\nincrease in the number of\nanxiety sources, dropping\nout of university might be the\nfastest and best way to cope\nwith mental stress.\n\\\\ Findings show\nthat just in 2014-15 a record 1,180\nstudents struggling\nwith mental\nhealth left higher\neducation \\\\\nIt\u2019s easier to drop out than find support\n\n"

This\nisn't to say that some people\nin my hometown don\u2019t suffer\nlike my friends in London, but\ncertainly more of them claim\nto be happy. Maybe it\u2019s the\ncountry way of life, or maybe\n\\\\ Sometimes ignorance is\nbliss, and an undiagnosed\npersonality disorder is just a\nquirk \\\\\nexperiencing and help us\nfind guidance and ways to\ncope. But there comes a point\nwhere these descriptions\nbecome our whole identity, we\nbecome nothing more than a\ncollection of precisely defined\ntraits. When these are our\ndefining features, rather than\nsimply being aspects of our\npersonality, we can lose track\nof who we are and use them\nas excuses to inhibit ourselves.\nThere is scientific evidence\nthat acting happy can raise\nyour mood and adjust your\nbrain chemistry. There is\nalso evidence to suggest\nthat thinking you should be\nmiserable can make you sad.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not\nfor a second suggesting that\nthose who truly are suffering\nfrom medically diagnosable\nmental health problems or\nsocial issues that affect their\nquality of life are doing\nanything wrong by identifying\nthese issues but some people\nhide behind them, which can\nhave a negative impact.\nInstead of just calling\nthemselves a bit shy, people\nare jumping on the Youtuberbacked trend of self-diagnosis,\nclaiming social anxiety for\nexample and using that as an\nexcuse for avoiding things that\nthey actually like to do. This\nisn\u2019t everyone \u2013 a lot of people\nuse it as a starting point to find\ntools to work on things they\nwant to change, but for others\nit justifies a complacency.\nWhen we force our\npersonality into boxes, we\nare sometimes forced into\nmanufacturing problems.\nAs soon as we\u2019ve found a\nproblem, we can then fall into\nour personality traits? When\nwe do that we are implicitly\nsaying that the perfect person\nis one without any of these\n\u2018problems\u2019: a person without\npersonality.\nAwareness of mental health\nproblems and removal of the\nstigma that surrounds them is\nhugely important, and I fully\nsupport the huge societal\ndrive to work on these things.\nBut some of the things we\u2019re\ndiagnosing aren\u2019t problems,\nthey\u2019re just traits. It\u2019s the same\nwhen we look at all disabilities\nas illnesses in need of a\ncure rather than features of\npeople that makes them who\nthey are: it\u2019s alienating and\ndehumanising.\nGiven that so much mental\nhealth research is done by\npharmaceutical companies\ntrying to flog you mood\nadjusting drugs, does it\nnot seem a bit sinister that\nwe\u2019re rushing to medicalise\nnormalcy? It\u2019s now normal to\nbe diagnosed with depression\nfollowing a bereavement,\nwhere in the past it would\nhave been a given that you\nwere grieving. If a diagnosis\nhelps you get support, then\nI\u2019m all for it, but all too often it\nmakes people think that there\nis something wrong with them,\nand it starts an endless cycle\nof depression that can be hard\nto break.\nIt's really important to be\nable to recognise and talk\nabout problems that we are\nexperiencing, and familiarity\n\\\\ As soon as we\u2019ve\nfound a problem,\nwe can then fall into\nthis cycle of being\nunhappy because\nwe think we should\nbe \\\\\nit's the lack of awareness\nthat all too often leads to\nself-diagnosis and, like a self-fulfilling prophecy, misery.\nDoes the hyperawareness\nof issues like social anxiety\nand mental health problems\nhelp diagnose and give us\nthe vocabulary to discuss our\nissues, or does it merely serve\nto overmedicalise personality\n\u2013 something that in turn makes\npeople unhappy?\nHaving words to describe\nourselves can give us an\nidentity. It can help us\neasily share what we are\n\\\\ Given that so\nmuch mental health\nresearch is done\nby pharmaceutical\ncompanies trying\nto flog you mood\nadjusting drugs,\ndoes it not seem a\nbit sinister that we\u2019re\nrushing to medicalise\nnormalcy? \\\\\nthis cycle of being unhappy\nbecause we think we should\nbe. Sometimes ignorance is\nbliss, and an undiagnosed\npersonality disorder is just a\nquirk.\nYou\u2019d be hard pressed to\nfind anyone who you couldn\u2019t\ndiagnose with some sort of\npersonality disorder. You want\na citation for that? \u2013 There are\nplenty in the medical literature.\nBut why do we do need to?\nHow is it helpful to diagnose\nand compartmentalise all of\nwith the vocabulary to do so\nis an important first step.

If we're lucky,\nand the gods of political\namusement are smiling upon\nus, this could be spearheaded\nby Tim Farron, backed mightily\nby his four fellow Lib Dem MPs,\nbut, then again, we might see\nhim pipped to the post by the\nfish finger running against him\nin his constituency (true story).\nWhat is inevitable, however, is\nthat whatever opposition we\nmay have in the Commons,\nit will be an embarrassment,\nwhich will negatively affect all\nvoters, whether the blood that\nruns in their veins is blue, red,\norange or green.\nThe ridiculously low bar\nset by Comrade Corbyn and\nCo. of the past two years has\nbeen, inexplicably, undercut\nin the weeks running up to\nthe election. Now, I don't\nespecially lament over a\nConservative victory, but the\nfact that they don't have to\nmake any real arguments in\nthis campaign, and are able to\nsit back and watch the other\nparties implode, is a little\n\\\\ Corbyn is desperately\ntrying to throw mud at Mrs.\nMay, but seems to fail even\nat that \\\\\ndepressing.\nJust look at the quality of\nopposition in this campaign. As\nI'm writing, the Conservative\nparty has just released their\nManifesto, and the customary\nreplies from major opposing\nParty members have come out.\nTo say that their arguments\nwere weak would be an\nunderstatement; their attempts\nat genuine political discussion\ncouldn't support a matchstick.\nfirst place. Adding a 2.5%\nclause isn't generous, it's just\nsilly. You don't need a higher\nincome per year if prices stay\nthe same \u2013 a change that\nis measured precisely and\nregularly by inflation rates.\nThe Winter Fuel Allowance is\nbeing scrapped only for those\npensioners wealthy enough\nto pay for their own fuel \u2013\nsomething Labour havebeen\nclamouring should happen for\nyears. As for social care, the\nTories are raising the amount\nof money that you can keep\nwhilst still being eligible for\nfree care \u2013 thus extending\nthe number of people who\nwon't have to sell their home\nor raid their pension pots to\npay for it. Not a single one\nof those 'opposing' arguments\nis logical, supported by fact,\nor even reflects the official\nLabour Party policy.\nThough there are some\ngenuine political discussions\nto be had in support Labour\u2019s\nfoundations, instead of\nmaking these, Corbyn is\ndesperately trying to throw\nmud at Mrs. May, but seems\nto fail even at that. His total\nlack of ability as a political\nopponent might be good for\nMrs. May, but it isn't good\nfor the governmental process\nof the United Kingdom, and\nit isn't good for you and me.\nWe need politicians to hold\neach other to account, and a\nframework where the attempts\nto do so are almost comical\ndoesn't help anyone.\nThe Lib Dems are even worse,\nnot that that's any surprise.\nInstead of looking at the\nserious issue of the European\nUnion, a key policy divide\nto which they are offering a\ngenuine political alternative,\nthey decided instead on this:\n\"Theresa May is betraying\nworking families by snatching\nschool lunches from their\nchildren and their homes when\nthey die.\"\nDear oh dear. Not only does\nthis patronisingly, and very\nunconvincingly, try to wield the\ngreat trigger words \u2013 'working\nfamilies' \u2013 but it is just factually\nincorrect. Under current rules,\nthe elderly have to sell their\nassets, including a long term\nfamily home, to pay for care.\nUnder the Tory proposals, not\nonly would they be able to live\nthe rest of their lives at home,\nbut they could keep more\nmoney to give to their family\nat the end of it.\nAs for the school meals\nthe Conservatives have\npledged to increase education\nspending, a measure funded\nby scrapping free school\nmeals for all pupils. The Lib\nDems have promised the same\nincreased expenditure on\neducation, but, as yet, haven't\nexplained how they'd pay for\nit \u2013 perhaps they figured that\nthey're not getting in anyway,\nso who needs a reasonable\nfinancial approach? I don't\ncare much for the Conservative\npolicies on social spending,\nbut I am not going to publicly\ndebase myself, as the Lib\nDems have done, by lying for\nno other reason than to make\nheadlines and glumly shake\nmy head on TV.\nThe Lib Dems should be\ntouting the honest political\ndialogue that they bring to the\ntable, and extolling the other,\nvalid political opinions they\nhave, instead of the frantic\nname-calling and flag-waving\nin which they're engaging.\nI honestly believe that all\npolitical parties have good\narguments, appeal to sensible\nvotingpeopleindifferentways,\nand play a vital role in the\ndemocratic landscape of our\nnation. In the current political\nenvironment, however, parties\nare wandering aimless in a\nsea of meaningless soundbites\nand thinly veiled stupidity; it is\na sorry sight.\nIn the Lord of the Rings,\na powerful female ruler,\nGaladriel, mulls over what her\npotentialfuturewouldlooklike,\nif she takes the Ring of power\nand becomes a supreme,\nmonarchical figure. Although\nshe heroically denies the\nopportunity, in her pondering\nshe declares that, if she ruled\nas such, \"All shall love me\nand despair\". I think a similar\nanalogy might be applicable\nto the current election. Mrs\nMay might rule with a great\nmajority, but we the people,\nalthough supporting her\nleadership, might forlornly\nlook at the broken pieces of\nour democratic process left\nlying in the ashes of a decent\nopposition.\n\\\\ The ridiculously\nlow bar set by\nComrade Corbyn\nand Co. of the\npast two years has\nbeen, inexplicably,\nundercut in the\nweeks running up to\nthe election \\\\\nTake Labour: \"She is hitting\nolder people with a classic\nnasty party triple whammy:\nScrapping the triple lock on\npensions, removing the Winter\nFuel Allowance and forcing\nthose who need social care to\npay for it with their homes.\"\nEven someone with Corbyn's\nlevel of education should be\nable to see how dishonest \u2013\nperhaps even stupid \u2013 those\nclaims are. The triple lock on\npensions is being replaced\nwith a guarantee to increase\nstate pensions by the higher\nof either inflation or the rise\nin wages, the only reason that\nthey need to be raised in the\n\n"
