Carl's application to a well known\naccountancy firm looked\nimpressive until one read\nhis leisure interests. In four\nwords Carl manages to\nhonestly sum up his\nlifestyle, Carl described his\nleisure interests as\ndrinking, woman ising, curries and cinema.\nPissed\nFailed R CSU presidential\ncandidate Guy Perry spent\nrather more time at Silwood\nBall than he had planned.\nWhen the ball ended on the\nSaturday morning Mr Perry\nwas 'crashed out'. Rather\nthan wake him his friends\ndecided to leave him there.\nA tired and emotional Mr\nPerry spent most of\nSaturday afternoon ringing\nround College in an\nattempt to get someone to\npick him up. Having finally\nbeen assured that someone\nwas on their way to pick\nhim up, Mr Perry decided\nto dilute his blood with a little alcohol. Unfortunately\na double cat as trophy struck. Back in College his\nfriends had taken a vote\nand decided to 'tell him his\nnot worth the petrol it'd cost'. Back at Silwood Mr\nPerry's attempts to get\npissed were failing because\nhe'd drunk most of a bottle\nof Grenadine before\nrealising that it is nonalcoholic syrup. Eventually\nMr Perry had to go begging\nthe money to enable him to\ncatch the last train back to\nCollege.\nPrince Charles IDave Jones\nDiisseldorf\nHugh Southey and Dave\nJones' trip to Diisseldorf\nappears to hae been quite a freebie. The more\nobservant Union hacks will\nhave noticed that the cards\nsent to places like the\nUnion Office had pictures\nof Mochengladbach rather\nthan Diisseldorf\n(Monchengladbach is half\nan hour form Dusseldorf by\ntrain), they also returned\nwith tales of a massive piss\nup in Dusseldorf on\nSaturday night when Dave\nJones was propositioned\nby an eighteen year old but\ncouldn't work out what was\ngoing on as he didn't speak\nGerman (weak excuse) and\nDave was accused of\nlooking like Prince Charles\nby some German students.\n(continued from page 4)\nA Transport\nOfficer Writes...\n' Dear Hugh,\nAt the Recreational Clubs\nCommittee (RCC) meeting\non Thursday 15th May,\nplans were revealed for\nUnion Finance Committee\n(UFC) to suspend grants to\nseveral high spending clubs\nnext year. Clubs named\nwere Balloon, Canoe,\nCaving, Gliding and\nMountaineering. This\naction is designed to save\nthe Union \u00a312,000;\nhowever, the removal of\nfinance from these clubs is\nsynonymous with killing\nthem off, since it becomes\nimpossible to operate and\nto attract and train new\nmembers without adequate\nfinance.\nThis action will, in\naddition to leading to the\nrapid demise of some of\nthe most active, successful\nand prestigious clubs, and\nhave other un desire able results.\n1 Four of the five RC C clubs named\n(Mountaineerng, Caving,\nCanoe and Balloon) are the\nmajor users of the transport\nsystem. The removal of\nfunds to these clubs would\nlead to the loss of over fifty\nterm time weekends of use;\nabout two months of Easter\nand Christmas vacation\nusage and up to four\nmonths of summer vacation\nhiring s. This would\nrepresent a loss of revenue\nto the union of the order of\n\u00a37000 to \u00a38000. The Union\ncan only offer it cheap hire\nrates on the basis of heavy\nusage of vehicles, and not\nallowing them to spend\nmost of their time in the\nparking lot. Such a reduction in revenue and\ndemand for vehicles would\nlead to a sharp reduction in\nthe fleet size to one or\nperhaps and the most two\nvehicles.\nThis would result in a large reduction in vehicle\navailability to both weekend\nand mi de week users and\nwould inevitably lead to\nmuch more expensive\ncharges to other users (\u00a340\nfor a single day plus\n15p/ mile for outside hire\ncompared with \u00a318/day\nplus 5p/ km for ICU vans).\nThis would inevitably lead to\nmuch greater costs ot\nmany other Union clubs\nand is undesirable. Further,\nthe opportunities for tours\nto the continent would be\nreduced as outside hire\nfirms rarely allow their\nvehicles to travel abroad.\nMany users would find\nthemselves unable to\nobtain transport at short\nnotice. The implicit\nusefulness of a Union\ntransport fleet in uncharged\nservices such as\ntransporting goods,\nmembers of the executive\nand council to Silwood etc\nwould be greatly reduced.\nIf this abhorrent policy of\nsaving money by axing\nclubs is adopted, budget\nshort falls, on the same\nbasis, would kill off othe\nlarge transport users in\nlater years and quickly lead\nto the Union being unable\nto run any vehicle. Thus\nthis short-sighted policy\nwould lead to a massive\nloss of utility to the whole\nUnion.\nFurther, RC C have\ntraditionally provided\npeople to help maintain the\ntransport system, since for\nhistorical reasons vehicles\noriginally belonged to RC C and not to ICU. This\nproposed UFC policy could\neasily lead to no people\nbeing prepared to run the\ntransport system in a reduced form.\n2 It would lead to a lower\nnumber of applicants to IC\nbecause of the resultant\npoorer club structure. Many\npeople in the past have\nbeen swung in their\ndecision to come to IC by\nits superb club structure.\n3 It would change the ethic\nof a student Union away\nfrom its acknowledged role\nof providing students with\nthe opportunity of\nacquiring useful skills in\nnew sports, re a creations and pastimes. All of the\nclubs threatened make an\nexcellent contribution to.\ntraining people in new\nsports that they would\notherwise have been unable\nto try. This range of\nopportunity must be\npreserved and not killed off\nbecause certain Union\nofficials decide to take\naction against societies\nwho are not well\nrepresented in the\nbureaucratic circles of the\nUnion. It would be a much\nmore honourable and\nresponsible choice to\ndistribute the expenditure\nreductions across the\nboard and allow all\nactivities to continue.\nDon't let the UFC destroy\nyour Union \u2014 oppose the\nmove to take away finance\nfrom any club.\nYours faithfully\nJJ Hasnip\nICU Transport Officer\n1985-1987\nRCC Transport Officer\n1985-1986\nMountaineering Club VicePresident 1986-1987\nFriday 23 May FELIX\n\n"

There is no policy\non what a report is meant\nto include. Half the reports\nthis year were a list of\npersonal opinions and the\nother half were factual. The\nAGM had to decide\nwhether personal opinions\nwere acceptable. It decided\nthey weren't accounts of\nthe year. It was then\nconsistent in throwing out\nreports that were largely\nopinions. I'm not going to\nattack Carl or the others for\nvoicing their opinions in\ntheir reports. He made a decision about what he felt\nthe report should include.\nHe was prepared to say\nwhat had upset him. I hope\nthat he and everyone else\naccepts the AGM s decision\nas laying guidelines for\nreports rather than being a personal attack on him or\nanyone else. Carl has done\nsome good things and a lot\nof the bitching was unfair. I hope that people start\nanalysing the successes\nand failures of the year\nrather than continue the\nbitching that has gone on\nfor the last few weeks.

ISSN 1040-0711.\nDisgusted\nDear Hugh,\nI was disgusted by the\ncomments of Carl Burgess\nin his annual report where\nhe said that FELIX this year\nhad not represented the\nviews of the majority of\nstudents and that basically\nyou were wasting your time\nand the Union's money\nproducing it. If this is the\ncase then why have so few\npeople written to FELIX\ncomplaining about its\ncontent.\nThe people who work on\nFELIX are very dedicated\nand hard working and it is\nthe first time in many years\nthat a FELIX editor has\nmanaged to produce a16 \u2022\npage FELIX throughout the\nyear. If articles and letters\ndo not get in then it is due\nto lack of space, and Hugh\ndoes his best to be fair to\neverybody.\nBefore Carl starts\ns lagging off other people\nhe should put his own\nhouse in order as his main\nachievement this year has\nbeen to bring discredit to\nthe College to the Union\nand to himself.\nIt seems that the reason\nfor Mr Burgess slamming\nFELIX is because Hugh has\nmade a stand against the\nUnion's misconduct and Mr\nBurgess, instead of facing\nup to his mistakes, is\npassing the buck and using\nHugh as a scapegoat.\nFinally all I can say is:\nCARL GROW UP\nDave Thomas\nLife Sci 1\nSouth Africa\nAgain\nDear Hugh,\nMay I reply to Alastair J Slimebag (FELIX 740). The\nmass organisations of the\nSouth Africa people (which,\nin the absence of any\ndemocratic mechanism\nprovide probably the best\nmeasure of popular\nopinion) are unequivocal in\ntheir calls to us to boycott\nSA goods. The working\npeople of South Africa do\nnot benefit from'SA\nexports: in the short term,\nthey are paid just enough\nto keep them in the squalor\nof the Bantustans. In the\nlonger term, every time we\nbuy Cape or Outspan we\nprolong their suffering by\nstrengthening those who\ndo benefit from that\noppression and\nexploitation. The boycott is\nthe best way we have to\nhelp South Africans toward\ndemocracy.\nMr Seymour is\ndepressingly close to the\ntruth when he says that\nstudents tend to buy what's cheapest. Think about it-it's hardly likely that such\n'good value' comes to us\nbecause some South\nAfrican fruit farmer decides\nto cut his profits it's just\nthat labour comes cheaper\nwhen you can beat\ntroublemakers to death.\nIf it weren't for my\namazing tolerance and\nmild-mannered ness(?) I'd join the bouncers at\n'Bananas' in spitting\nvoluminously and often on\nthis Seymour wally.\nYours,\nPete Hobbis\nColours\nDear Hugh,\nWith the publishing of this\nyear's Social Colour awards\nin FELIX last week, the\nannual, and rather\ndistasteful, discussion as to\nwho deserves, and who\ndoes not deserve Colours\nhas ended again. I cannot\nhelp but wonder whether\nthe whole business is\nnecessary; what does the\nUnion gain by awarding\ncolours, and, more\nimportantly, what could we\nbe losing?\nColours are meant as a recognition by one's peers\nof work done for the Union\nand the or ec tic ally any\nmember of the Union can\nnominate anybody else for\nColours. In practise,\nhowever, it is those in\ncharge of the various\ngroups and clubs that do\nthis nominating, and it is\nthe same people that sit on\nthe various Colours\ncommittees that decide\nwhich awards are made,\nand which are rejected.\nAny 'appeal' has to be\nmade to Union Council,\nwhere we get the situation\nthat happened at Council\nrecently; very heated\nattacks against\nnominations. I am not sure\nthat it is possible to\ndiscriminate between this\nand personal attacks when\nyou are at the meeting;\nwhat impression can you\nexpect someone not at the\nmeeting who only hears the\n'gossip' to get?\nThe problem with\nColours, or any form of\npeer recognition is that you\nhave to be careful to keep\npersonalities out of it. If\nmembers of the group\nbegin to get the impression\nthat they are not getting\nre cog niton because a small\nminority of their peers,\nperhaps the leaders, are\nholding personal grudges\nthen any such system can\nonly lead to bitterness and\ndivison. Unfortunately I think we have reached that\nstate within the Union.\nEven a club captain, with\nthe best will in the world,\ncan fall foul of this if they\naward Colours a large\nnumber of people, some of\nthose awarded think that\ntheir award has been\ndevalued because other\nmembers (who they think\ndo not deserve Colours)\nhave been awarded them. If\nyou only award to a few,\nthen those who miss out\nare upset. In cases like this,\nhaving a good intention is\nnot good enough, fair play\nhas to be seen to be done,\nand this is very difficult.\nI believe we should\nseriously consider the\nfuture of the Social Colours\nsystem within the Union;\ncertainly there should be a re-evaluation of the\nbenefits and the\ndrawbacks.\nYours,\nChris Martin.\nDoC PG\n2 Friday 23 May FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Where's It All Gone\nYup, it's that time again.\nYou look at your bank\nbalance, then work out how\nmuch money you have\nspent this term and think\n\"where has it all gone?'.\nExternal Affairs Officer\nGren Manuel conducted\nour very own IC Union\nsurvey last term, and using\nthe results of this and that\nwonderful CDC computer\nhas found the answer. All is\nrevealed in his personal\ncommentary.\nA few weeks ago I commented on a survey\nmade by the University of\nLondon on income and\nexpenditure of students in\nthe whole of the University.\nNow its time to narrow the\nfield down a little and\npresent the results of the\nsurvey done on students at\nIC.\nAbout 500 forms were\nsent out, that's to 10% of\nCollege. I got about 100\nback (thanks to those who\nreturned them, to those\nwho didn't: don't complain\nthat IC Union doesn't care\nwhat you think).\nGovernment policy: who cares?\nfact only eight people were\nliving in accommodation\ncosting less than \u00a325/week.\nAlthough the figure is\nmeant for guidance only, it\nis clearly too little. In fact\nonly the availability of\ncheap College\naccommodation, in\nparticular in Evelyn\nGardens, prevents this\nfigure from being a lot\nhigher. In the private sector\n\u00a330 is the usual rate, with\nmany paying more. That\nshould keep the Housing\nBenefit people busy\n(incidentally I 've just\nreceived my Xmas HB\u2014is\nthis a record?)\nRent: Rents averaged\n\u00a327.33 per week. For many\nof these figures I computed\nseparate data for home\nUGs\u2014this is not because\nhome UGs are more\nimportant than other\nstudents but to enable\nsome objective assessment\nto be made of the\nGovernment grant. Home\n1\nUGs living away from home\n1\naveraged \u00a329.33 per week.\nThe London UG grant\nincludes \u00a321 for rent. In\nOther Spending: Mr/Ms\nnormal student spends\n\u00a314.40 on food (which,\naccording to my\ncalculations will buy 3\nburgers per day from the\nUnion Snack Bar).\nTherefore food and rent for\nthe home UG make up\nnearly \u00a345 out of a \u00a360\ngrant per week, with\nclothes, entertainments and\ntravel yet to come.\nEntertainments averaged\n\u00a310.40 (which includes\nsports etc as well as the\nmore obvious beer and\nfags).\nSpending on clothes\naverages \u00a33.20 a week\n(although a look at any\ngroup at IC students makes\nthis figure seem impossibly\nhigh), and on textbooks is\n\u00a31.80/week.\nTravel is more tricky.\nMany walk or cycle of\ncourse and so incur no\ntravel costs above shoe\nleather or the occasional\nnew set of tyres. The\naverage cost of travel is\n\u00a32.55. For the 39% of home\nUGs who incur travel costs\nthe typical amount thrown\ndown the drain is \u00a36.08.\nSome of you may\nremember that once upon a time home students could\nclaim travel costs above\n\u00a350/year from their LEA.\nThis was replaced two\nyears ago with a flat once\nonly increase in the grant\nof \u00a3110. Since then grants\nhave risen 5%, while fares\n(in London) rose by more\nthan this in last January's increase.\nThe flat increase in the\ngrant was fairly small\nanyway, but the excuse of\n'reducing administration\ncosts' no longer carries any\nweight. As was predicted at\nthe time the government\njust wanted to save some\ncash by cutting the\nj star dard of living of\nstudents.\nBenefit: It is interesting that\nof those eligible (home\nstudents) about half claim\nhousing benefit). The\nGovernment is attempting\nto change the rules\nregarding HB (translation:\nmake you poorer) at the\nmoment, with those not\nliving in College\naccommodation losing\nabout \u00a3150 in a year on\naverage it will be\ninteresting to see if\npretence at fairness lasts\nfor as long.\nThere was quite a bit of\nother info gleaned from the\nforms about IC Union's priorities etc but you're all\ndying to finish this piece\nand get on to the film\nreviews section, so I 'll stop.\nNeedless to say that the\nwhole point of the survey\nwas to try and get IC Union\nmore responsive to its\nmembers preferences, and\nmore able to represent their\ninterests. If anyone has any\nquestions on the results\nthen please seek me out\n(please someone ask me\nsomething) or I will be only\ntoo pleased to send anyone\nwho wants one (staff or\nstudents) a summary of the\nresults.\nFELIX Friday 23 May 11\n\n"

    "content": "Lovely Boys.\nSimon Lewis goes to the London Palladium's screaming success.\nLa Cage is a music, light\nand costume extravaganza,\nentertaining with a visual\ndisplay that makes the\nLloyd-Webber musicals\nseem tacky by comparison.\nArthur Laurents, the\nDirector, who's written\nwork includes West Side\nStory and The Turning\nPoint, has recreated the\nstuff that the dream movies\nof the 50's were made of. If\nshowbiz razzle is desired\nthen La Cage will fulfil your\nevery desire.\nThe story is plain\nenough, involving the love\nof man for man, George for\nAlbin (Dennis Quilley,\nGeorge Hearn) and it's effect on the love of man\nfor woman, Jean-Michel for\nJacqueline (Jonathan\nMorris, Wendy Roe).\nCentered around a Gay\nRiviera club, Jean,\nGeorge's son, falls in love\nwith the daughter of a reactionary politician.\nWhen the time comes for\nfuture in-laws to be\nintroduced, Jean is\nadam ent that his fiance's parents should not meet\nthe two men who have\nraised him; his thoughtless\nattitude results in a multitude of problems for\nGeorge who must explain\nto Albin why after twenty\nyears he is required to\nleave his home; eventually\nAlbin is ousted for a 'real'\nwoman. However, at the\nlast minute, total chaos\nresults when she fails to\nturn up for the parental\nencounter. Albin initially\nsaves the day by posing as\nJean's mother, until\ninevitably he is found out\nby Jacqueline's father. Not\nsurprisingly, as might be\nexpected from any musical,\nall the problems\nencountered are worked\nout by the finale, and those\nwho deserve to live happily\never after, do!\n'Our baby is getting\nmarried! Where did we go\nwrong...Snakes live man\nand woman together, Cats\nlive man and woman\ntogether, we are humans!'\nQuilley and Hearn are\npolished and understated,\nand avoid the pitfalls of\nstereotyping the characters\nthey play. Particularly\nmemorable is the moment\nwhere George tries to teach\nAlbin how to be 'straight',\nalthough it seems that\nGeorge's efforts are fated\nfrom the start!\nThe supporting role of\n'Les Cagelles' (The Chorus)\nlinks the scenarios together\nwith grace, and the entire\n'Line' exude talent and\nenergy. The question of\ntheir true gender is left\nuntil the finale!\nLa Cage is not a classic\nmusical in the sense of\nWest Side Story or 42nd Street, the musical\nnumbers are not of the\nsame calibre. However, the\ncostumes and sets are\nmagni fi cant, and they must\nbe seen since a description\nwould undoubtedly not do\nthem justice. No expense is\nspared.\nAlthough billed in some\npublications as a heterosexual love story, La\nCage presents two middle\naged people who have\nspend twenty years of their\nlives together. The core of\nthis amusing musical is\ntheir love for each other.\nThis does much to present\na more positive image of a community that is\nconstantly put down by the\nmedia. La Cage is a celebration of their\nemancipation.\nAstounding Sounds.\nPete Wilson plays with the Yuppies new toys.\nAn Invitation to Windham\nHill\n(distributed by A&M)I listened to it on my\nWalkman while going\n'round Sainsburys. It was\ngreat; I felt like I was in a movie, and, at any moment\nI would crash my trolley\ninto the girl of my dreams.\nOur eyes would meet and\nwe'd have a whirlwind\nromance before one of us\ndying of cancer. And all the\ntime An Invitation to\nWindham Hill plays in the\nbackground. I didn't crash\nmy trolley into anyone, but\nthen how much can you\nexpect from an LP?\nWindham Hill began\nmodestly in 1976, an artist\nowned record label\nreleasing instrumental\nmusic which does not fit\neasily into the jazz, rock or\nfolk categories. In 1976 one\nrecord was released in a pressing of 300. In 1985\nWindham Hill realised sales\nin excess of one million.\nAn Invitation to Windham\nHill is a collection of ten\ntitles from seven of the\nartists currently on\nWindham Hill. Michael\nHedges, who recently\nsupported Suzanne Vega in\nLondon, deserves a mention for his 'unusual'\nguitar technique. According\nto Capital Radio he is\ngoing to be big in the UK.\nAlso worth a mention is\nMark Isham and William\nAdverman, who started the\nlabel in the first place.\nIt is perhaps not fair to\ntry to pick out high points\nof this album, as it is\nconsistently good,\nconsistently virtuoso. I hope we shall hear more of\nWindham Hill in this\ncountry in the future.\nre vie "

This lecture showed the\nimportance and need for\npure research and that a lot\nof important research\noccurs outside the bastions\nof western universities.\nPill For Jet Lag\nRecent research in the US\nsuggests that\nbenzodiazepine sleeping\ntablets may be of use in\ncoping with jet lag.\nMany of the functions of\nthe human body are\nperiodic: the body has a clock, called the circadian\nclock, which has a period\nof around 24 hours. It is\nsynchronise d using the 24\nhour alternation of light\nand dark, day and night.\nWhen humans travel to\ndifferent time zones, the\nclock gets out of phase\u2014it\nis still ticking away, but it\nisn't quite sure what time it\nis. The human biological\nclock needs resetting.\nThis is usually achieved\nby repeated exposure to\nthe local cycle of day and\nnight\u2014after a few cycles\nthe brain accepts the shift\nin phase, and jet lag has\npassed.\nThe benzodiazepine drug\nmay allow people to reset\ntheir biological clocks just\nas easily as they reset their\nwatches.\nScientists in the US took\na hamster, and recorded its\nactivity rhythm for two\nweeks. They then injected\nthe animal with a neutral\nsubstance at any one of\neight equally spaced times\nin its circadian clock cycle.\nThe activity rhythm\ncontinued as usual. But if\n2.5mg of the\nb enzo diaz a epo in e drug\ntria zola m was added, the\nclock was changed by\nabout an hour. The\nhamsters bedtime\u2014and all\nits other regular functions\nsuch as wheel-running\nactivity\u2014were immediately\nput back one hour, or\nadvanced one hour. (The\ndirection of the effect\ndepended on the time of\nday when the drug was\nadministered.) What is\nmore, the size of the phase\nshift could be easily\ncontrolled, the scientists\ndicovered, by altering the\ndose of Triazolam.\nThe implications for jet\ntravellers are obvious.\nThe drug is thought to\nwork by potenti a ting the\naction of the\nneurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid, a widely\ndistributed transmitter in\nthe central nervous system\nFriday 23 May FELIX\n\n"

The retiring\nclub captain Paul\nRichardson noted that this\nwas evidenced by a larger\ncore of members who\nattended training sessions\nregularly, unlike the\nprevious season at which\npoint it was thought the\nclub would fold.\nThe most notable swim\nof the year was recorded\nby Dave Brocklebank in the\nULU championships when\nhe lowered the university\nrecord to 72.45 for the\n100m breaststroke. One\nother notable result was\nImperial's eighth place in\nthe UAU Mens Long\nCourse Championship held\nat Blackpool. Our\noutstanding event was the\n4x100m relay in which Ian\nRiddle, Dave Brocklebank,\nRob Eastman and Graeme\nJohnston came sixth\noverall, beating arch rivals\nLoughborough. This result\nwas enough to relegate a stronger UCL team into\ntenth place in the entire\nevent which was eminently\nsatisfying for our five man\nteam. Due to the lack of\nswimming competition no\ncolours were awarded.\nThe water-polo team\nwere the most active side\nof the club this season,\nreaching the finals of the\nUAU championships and\nfinishing fifth in the country\nwith a depleted side.\nThroughout the university\nseason as well as the\nMiddlesex League we have,\nshown that we have the\ntalent to su cee d if not the\nfinishing touches or\nconsistency that is\nrequired. Next year should\nprove the testing ground\nwith several players leaving\nincluding Rob Eastman\nwho was awarded a special\nprize in recognition of his\nhelp with the team and the\ngaining of his first English\nInternational Cap. The new\ncaptain, Dave Wall, noted\nthat club confidence was\nrising and this coupled with\na good season would pay\ndividends in the long run.\nTo emphasize this point\nthe water-polo team\nthrashed the national Royal\nNavy side 13-7 last Friday\nproving to all critics that\nthe club as a whole is in\nthe ascendent and looking\nforward to a very\nprosperous new academic\nseason. Early on the writing\nwas on the wall for the\nNavy side as Imperial\npulled away steadily\nleading 6-2 at half time\nfrom goals by Rob\nEastman, Steve Davis and\nPaul Richardson. Although\nthe navy tried to\nconsolidate serious holes in\ntheir defence were\nconsistently being\npunished by Johnston and\nWilliams with the finishing\npower of the Spooner twins\noverwhelming the visitors\nin the second half.\nThe following colours\nwere awarded to the water-polo team:-Half Colours Jim Crowder,\nFull Colours Steve Davis,\nPaul Richardson, Dave\nBrocklebank, Graeme\nJohnston, Rob Eastman,\nNigel Williams.\nSTAFF CRICKET\nHere It\nIs Jim!\nIC staff cricket club\n(ICSCC) began their\ndefence of the Mid-Kent\nCounty Championship with\nan arr row win over Bridon\nat Barnehurst. ICS CC elected to bat but high\nwinds and lack of match\npractice contributed to a disaster o us batting collapse\nwhich found them at 21 for\n6. Only an excellent 87 run\npartnership between K Buckley and A Dengel\nsaved the innings. Bridon\nthreatened to overtake IC\neasily after a brisk start, but\naccurate bowling by J Baben and the fielding of C Gordon off M Masento\nretrieved the match.\nBridon's innings was closed\nwhen R Blench, a name to\nwatch in the future,\nuprooted Maitlands middle\nstump in a race against\ndeepening gloom leaving\nICS CC winners by 14 runs.\nICS CC is open to all staff\nand post grads at IC and\nwelcomes new players.

    "content": "Caving\nDefended\nDear Hugh,\nWe were greatly concerned\nto hear of a proposal by\nDave Kingston to withdraw\nall funding from certain\nprestige Union clubs. The\nclubs threatened are\nrumoured to include\nBalloon, Boat, Canoe,\nCaving, Gliding,\nMountaineering, STOIC and Yacht, eight of the\nmost distinguished clubs at\ncollege. All of these clubs\nare well known outside\nCollege and bring good\npublicity for Imperial\nCollege.\nThese proposed cuts are\ndue to the fact that next\nyear's planned expenditure\nexceeds available funding\n! by approximately \u00a312,000\n| and rather than taking a fair cut across the board it\nseemed easier to close\ndown certain sel c ted clubs.\nThese threatened clubs\n| have been given barely a week to prepare their case\njustifying their continued\nexistance. Not only is this\nappallingly short notice but\nI the timing of the\nannouncement comes in\nthe middle of many\nstudents' exams.\nThis planned drastic\nmove would literally\ndestroy the threatened\nclubs whose expertise and\nreputation has been built\nup over long years of\ndedicated commitment to\n!\ntheir club and their sport\nby the many students who\nhave been members of\nthese prestigious clubs.\nThese clubs are as\nwilling as any other take\ntheir fair share of the\nnecessary cuts in proposed\nspending, but removing\nfunding and hence closing\nthese clubs would leave\nsubstantial gaps in the\nactivities available to\nstudents, making IC an\neven less attractive\nuniversity for potential\nstudents.\nAn active member of the\nI caving club would expect\nto spend in the region of\n.I \u00a3700 per annum on\n| maintain ance and purchase\nof necessary equipment,\nand term-time and vacation\nactivities. Eight members of\nthe caving club will be\nspending at least \u00a3700 this\nsummer on an expedition\nto Canadian Rockies.To us\nt this represents a serious\nfinancial commitment to\nour sport and withdrawal of\nUnion funds would\nincrease this burden out of\nall proportion and would\nI undoubtedly put the sport\nof caving beyond the reach\nof new College members.\nThis would mark the end of\na quarter of a century of\ncaving at Imperial College.\nFor these reasons we feel\nthese proposals are totally\nunreasonable and\nunacceptable, we hope\nUFC will see sense on this\nissue.\nYours Sincerely\nNeil Pattinson, Richard\nCollcott, Dave Wilson\nBalloon\nDefended\nDear Ed,\nImperial is one of only\nthree colleges in Britain\nwith a hot air balloon club.\nIf Union Finance\nCommittee have their way\ntoday there may only be\ntwo university balloon\nclubs next year.\nAt the RC C general\nmeeting last week we were\ntold of a crazy UFC policy\nto cease funding 'two or\nthree' high spending clubs\nnext year. There is a \u00a315,000 shortfall in Union's grant next year!! Five RC C clubs (balloon one of them)\nhave been put on a 'hit list'\nby UFC and we have had\nthe grand total of eight\ndays notice to justify our\nexistence and stop this\nridiculous UFC policy\nbeing approved. Why\ncouldn't the clubs have\nbeen told earlier of the\nproblems facing union\nin order to find a solution?\nUFC have it in their\nminds that by denying\nactivities such as\nmountaineering, canoeing,\nballooning, caving etc, to\nstudents this financial\nproblem will be solved.\nOnly in the short term will\nit have any effect. By\ncutting a grant to any club\nthe Union is stabbing itself\nin the back. College will\nsee the Union's defeatist\nattitude as an opportunity\nto cut the Union grant in\nfollowing years.\nThe clubs singled out for\nclosure are amongst the\nmost prestigious in\nCollege. Balloon club has\nexisted for ten years, a relatively young club, and\nin that time many members\nhave given valuable time to\nbuild the club to its present\nthriving state.\nBalloon club is a fantastic advertisement for\nUnion and for College. We\nhave been INVITED to four\nballoon meets this summer,\none of which is the Bristol\nFiesta regularly attracting\nmore than 100,000 people\neach year. We project a fine image of College, all\nover the country, unlike\nother 'elements' in College.\nOur prestigious RC C clubs should not be forced\nto close. This policy is yet\nanother sign of the decay\nof IC Union.\nMike Carpenter\nChairman Balloon Club\nMountaineering\nDefended\nSir,\nAt the recent Recreational\nClubs Committee meeting\n(15th May) the five largest\nspending clubs per head\n(Balloon, Canoe, Caving,\nGliding and\nMountaineering) were\nasked to provide written\njustification for their\nexpenditure. It appears that\nUFC is to consider axing\nthe grants given to these\nclubs in order to rectify\nnext year's Union budget\ndeficit. This would be an\nMountaineering: under threat\neffective kiss-of-death for\nthose societies involved.\nMountaineering has\nprovided such a list of\nreasons for justifying our\nexistence. I am sure these\npoints are mirrored by the\nother threatened clubs. To\nprevent the disappearance\nof these points in to a web\nof Union intrigue and\nmindless bureaucracy ,\nthey are outlined below\n1 One of the Union's primary aims is to give\ncollege students the\nopportunity of participating\nin activities in which they\nhave not had, or will not\nhave a chance to partake.\nThe cessation of official\nclub activities would not\nprevent previously active\nmountaineers from\nclimbing but it would stunt\nthe ambitions of many\naspirant climbers, who had\nbeen assured of the\npresence of a mountaineering club by\nvarious union and college\npublications.\n2 The Mountaineering\nClub is perhaps the oldest\nuniversity climbing club in\nBritain with a60 year\nhistory. During the period\nan excellent expedition\nrecord has been\nestablished. In the past two\nyears the club has added\nmajor new routes in S America and S Africa.\nThese achievements have\ndone much to project our\ncollege's image abroad. To\nstop such endeavour in an\nact of Dickensian penny-pinching would be tragic.\n3 Our club is arguably the\nmost experienced and\nactive college\nmountaineering\norganisation in London. We\nhave 25 Union members\nand about 15 non-union\nmembers (generally former\nstudent) who engage in\nactivities ranging from\nHimalayan mountaineering\nto boulder i fig. Our\ncommit t ment to the sport is\nhigh, an average member\nof the club probably\nspends about \u00a3600 per year\nof his own money on\nclimbing. To say that these\npeople could be\naccommodated in other\ncollege clubs is naive.\nAn all en comp a sing outdoor club would be\nunmanageable and\nunsatisfying for a majority\nof its members.\n4 The forthcoming\ninstallation of college's new\n\u00a38,000 climbing wall seems\nan inappropriate time to\npropose the disbanding of\none of the club's who are\npledged to help maintain\nthis facility.\n5 As the outdoor clubs\nprovide the bulk of the\nUnion's transit van income\n(and manpower for running\nthe RCC), I hope that UFC has not overlooked the\npossibility of stabbing itself\nin the back.\nThus I feel that to totally\naxe certain clubs is unfair,\nthe load should be shared,\nwe are more than willing to\nhelp, but we will not sit\nback as the death sentence\nis passed (with only 8 days\nbetween arrest and\nexecution). Are certain\nUnion notables to take on\nthe guise of trigger-happy\ndespots while the clubs and\nsocieties peer down the\ngun barrel? Whose turn\nwould it be next year when\nanother deficit appears?\nHow long before the Union\npushes it self over the\nabyss and ceases to serve\nany of its members other\nthan a drunken clique?\nYours\nMark Dixon (Chem 3)\n(The last?)

The sabbaticals'\nreports in particular normally\nform a permanent record of the\nyear. The rejection of the two\nmain reports is un pre c en dented and leave's much of the Union's work this year unrecorded\nexcept in the much shorter non-sabbatical officers' reports.\nPresident Carl Burgess\nannounced his intention of not\nproducing another Annual\nReport to replace the rejected\none.\nThe major objections to the\nreports centred on personal\ncomments about other Union\nofficers by the President and\nDP. In the case of the\nPresident's report, criticism\nwas made of his comments on\nFELIX and the Publications\nBoard. Mr Burgess added a new\nsection to the report toning\ndown some of his comments,\nbut Sarah Greaves still objected\nto its adoption. On the vote the\nreport was defeated.\nDP Dave Kingston withdrew\nsections of his report which\ncriticized External Affairs\nOfficer Grenville Manuel and\nWelfare Officer Pete Wilson. Its\nacceptance was nevertheless\nopposed by Mark Cottle and it\nwas heavily defeated.\nThe report of Hon Sec\nQuentin Fontana was accepted\nwithout a vote after a few\nquestions from the floor. Then\nthe report of Academic Affairs\nOfficer J Martin Taylor was\nconsidered. Carl Burgess\nobjected to his comment that\nthis had been the worst year for\nthe Union in his seven years as\na student here, and his\ndescription of the sabbaticals as\n'the most in com pet ant, lazy and\ninexperienced leadership that I have ever seen'. However, the\nreport was passed un amended by a comfortable majority.\nThe reports of the Internal\nServices Chairman the PG\nOfficer, the Publications Board\nChairman, the Rag Chairman,\nthe RC C Chairman and the\nSCAB Chairman were all\nquickly passed. Objections were\nmade to Welfare officer Pete\nWilson's report, on the grounds\nthat it was a bad as Dave\nKingston's, and it was defeated\non the vote.\nEarlier in the meeting the\nPresidient presented Union\nGeneral Awards to Sean Davies,\nChris Hendy, Nick Shackley and\nHugh Southey. This is the\nPresidents personal award for\noutstanding services to the\nUnion. He also presented Social\nColours to several members of\nCollege staff who have helped\nthe Union during the year.\nElections were held at the\nmeeting for Ordinary Members\nof Council, with Symon Corns\nand Jerry Hasnip being elected,\nand for a member of House\nCommittee, with Alan Rose\nbeing elected. The meeting also\npassed unanimously a motion\non Human Rights proposed by\nChristine Taig. Finally, Shaun\nDunlop proposed a motion\nbanning Barclays Bank\nadvertising in Union\npublications, but as soon as he\nhad finished the quorum was\nchallenged. Since less then 300\npeople were present the\nmeeting closed due to\nin quo racy. Mr Burgess and Mr Kingston\nboth stood by the comments in\ntheir reports when interviewed\nafter the meeting. Mr Burgess\npointed out that only the Pub\nBoard section of his report was\nquestioned, and that the rest\nwas rejected along with this.\nHe thought there had been a great deal of personal animosity\nin the Union this year, which he\nregretted. Despite the rejections\nof his report, he felt that he had\ndone his job well, better than\nmost people realised.\nMr Kingston said he had\nchanged some sections of his\nreport after discussing it with\nthe people he had criticized. He\nfound he had got some facts\nwrong and could not justify\nsome of his statements, so he\namended his report. He still\nstood by his report as amended.\nHe too mentioned the high level\nof personal animosity this year,\nand felt that the sabbaticals\nwere not respected by other\nUnion officers.\n2% Cut For IC\nImperial College will receive a1.2% increase in its recurrent\ngrant next year, says the latest\nUGC circular to ViceChancellors and Principals. This\n'increase' is above average for\nthe University system as a whole but represents a2% cut\nin the purchasing power of the\nIC grant. The UGC were given a3% increase overall for next\nyear, but due to the rise in local\nauthority rates which\nconstitutes an inordinately large\npart of the UGC budget, and\ndue to other UGC obligations,\nthey were unable to add more\nthan 1% to the block grant\nwhich is distributed to the\nUniversities.

    "content": "BOAT CLUB\nGhent Tour Successes\nCrews from Imperial beat\ninternational standard\nopposition form France,\nGermany, Belgium and\nBritain, to bring back a gold, silver and two bronze\nmedals. This is a remarkable result and is\nunprecedented in the club's history\nThe whole tour started\nout more disaster ou sly. To\nmake the ferry to Dunkirk\nwe needed to be at the\nboat club by six thirty in\nthe morning. When the\ncoach arrived we were\nsurprised to find that it had\nmetamorphosed from the\nluxury coach with video,\ntoilet and reclining seats\nthat was promised to a scrawny 'Fortune Travel'\ncoach, with no amenities\nand quarter sized seats.\nNaturally we totally believe\nthe drivers story that the\npromised coach had been\n'vandalised'.\nIt was raining in Belgium\nwhen we arrived and the\nradioactive drizzle hardly\nstopped\u2014but that didn't stop us all from being\nsuntanned\u2014thanks Uncle\nGorbachev.\nLightweight Coxless four\nThe members of the\nlightweight cox less four\nhad considerable difficult\nmaking the weight. Their\nfirst weigh in revealed that\nthey needed to loose three\nkilograms, before averaging\nunder 70kg. After a run in\nextra kit they managed to\nsweat off the surplus, but\nwere by this time looking\nhorrify n gly emaciated. After\nsuch trauma the crew were\ndelighted to pick up the\ngold medal on Saturdaybeating crews from\nGermany and Holland. The\nsecond day's racing\nbrought them a further\nbronze medal.\nCoxed Four\nBy contrast to the\nlightweights, the\nheavyweight cox ed four\nbelieved that their\nperformance was marred\nby their requirement to\nrace early heats before\nbreakfast. I don't think its\nquite so simple: the\ncontinental breakfasts with\nwhich we were provided\nwere so u nap pet ising that\nonly Vince 'Dustybin' Roper\nwas able to manage two,\nand even he is suspected of\nulterior motives. As is often\nthe case with Vince there\nmay have been a woman\ninvolved. Despite their\nsevere breakfast d efficiency the cox ed four still\nmanaged convincingly to\nwin their heat and gained a silver medal losing only to\na crew from the German\nnational squad. As with the\nlightweights they also won\na bronze on the second\nday.\nHeavyweight Coxless Four\nThe problem with the\ncox less boats is their\nerratic steering and it was a tragic case of bad steering\nthat spoiled the medal\nhopes of the heavyweight\ncox less four, and that\nfound them attempting to\nrow on dry land.\nEight\nThe second eight, if\nnothing else, made a positive contribution to\ninternational detente. They\nsuffered a series of\ndisasters leaving them two\nmen short at Ghent and so\nwere forced to recruit from\nthe pool of international\noarsmen, who had finished\ncomp a ting for th day. They\nwere very lucky to find a Dutchman, who being\nunable to speak English,\nwas unaware quite what\nwas required of him and\nafter the race was unable to\nvoice his opinions of their\nrowing. This as it turns out\nwas a good thing, because\nthe eight didn't exactly win.\nThe tour was enjoyable and\nworthwhile. It was pleasing\nto see none of the\ndrunken ess associated with\nBritish sports fans abroad.\no1is a mm ws mmm\\ ATHLETICS\nLondon\nColleges\nChampionship\nVictory\nNo mistakes on selection\nwere made this year by the\nAthletics Secretary in\nsending a virtually full\nImperial squad to London\nColleges Athletics champs\nat Motspur Park on\nTuesday and Wednesday\nthe 29th and 30th April.\nThe overall performance\nwas exceptional and\neveryone in the squad\npulled their weight.\nFor the ladies, Imoni\nAkpofure came third in\n100/200m finals (13.6/28.8)\nfinished 6th in the 100m hurdles final and jumped\n1.40m in the high jump for\n5th and good points-the\nfirst six in each event\nscoring. Louise McKeown\ncame 6th in the ladies\n800m and Jane Murphy\nthrew the discus nearly\n18m for 5th. In the ladies\n300m Kate Spence ran\nparticularly well in rapidly\ndiminishing light for\nsecond place. Jo Savage\nyet again proved invaluable\nfor the ladies with a1.50m second place in the high\njump, 4th in the 100\nhurdles final and 6th in the\nshot.\nThe mens' team was by\nfar the strongest for years.\nAlthough a couple of\npeople were injured. In the\nsprints we again had a display of the Nehinda law\nof motion and training,\nnamely the less training\nyou appear to do the faster\nyou go with a valiant\nattempt at the 'sprint\ndouble'-1st in 100m(11.2s),2n d in 200m(22.8s). Bryan\nGamblin was deprived of\nmedals in the 800m(1:57.9),1500m(4.13.8) and\n2000m steeplechase\n(6:29.8) coming second\neach time to UK 5000m man Mark Scrutton as was\nGavin Waterson in 3000m(2 nd:9:07). Doing a good\nsupporting role to these\nmen were Mike Jones (6th,400 m), Trevor Shaw (4th,1500 m) and captain Jon\nLea (3rd in both 2000 s/c and 3000m). Pete Sedders\ncarved a new niche for\nhimself in the 110m hurdles\nwhich he won whilst doing\nhis usual sterling work in\nthe field with a2nd in both\nDiscus (31.28m) and\nHammer, 4th in the Javelin\ninjuring himself in the\nprocess, and a win of\n10,66m in the shot. Chris\nOwen supported well in the\nHammer wii ha third. In the\n2000m Walk Chris\nWheedon walked away with\nit (sorry Ed) and John Pope\ndid the secretaries job\ngetting good points for\nthird place. The triple jump\nproved quite strong this\nyear with R Johnson\ngaining only 4th for a jump\nof 12.56m which has been\nknown to win the\nchampionship before. UK\nRanked Long Jumper\nDenzil Nicholson showed\nhis class leaping over a metre further than his\nnearest rival with a jump of\n7.13 metres.\nFinally, the team was\ncomplete with a guy who is\nprobably closer than\nanyone else will be to\nhuman powered flight in\nthis country for a long time.\nGeoff Parsons, UK indoor\nand outdoor record holder\nwho only recently improved\nhis outdoor best by 1cm to\n2.27m at Crystal Palace\nscissor ed over 2.00m, casually leapt 2.20m to set\na Motspur Park ground\nrecord and made a good\nattempt at 2.27m on a relatively poor run up\nsurface. To add to this, he\njumped 13.76m in the triple\njump for a clear second\nand finished 4th in the\n100m. Many thanks are due to\neveryone who took\npart\u2014every single person\nwas invaluable.

University\ngrants have, he said,\ndeclined by 20% in real\nterms since 1980 and cuts\ncould reach a total of 30%\nby the end of the decade.\nThis roughly concurs with\nthe prediction of the\nRector, Professor Eric Ash,\nof a10% cut for IC over the\nnext five years, as there is\nnow no reason to expect\nthat IC will get any special\ntreatment from the GU C. Mr Shock also felt that a more long term approach to\nHigher Education should\nbe taken by the\nGovernment. For the\npresent, however, he\nsummed up the situation by\nsaying, 'no university is\ngoing to be better off next\nyear'.\nHammers\nSlammed\nWorkmen in Falmouth\nKeogh Hall have been\nbanned from hammering\nand structural drilling until\nthe end of the exams.

Mr Hallworth told\nFELIX though that he had\nnot realised that students\nwere being disrupted. He\nsaid he had written at\nEaster to the hall wardens\nand housekeepers telling\nthem that he would stop\nany work that was\ndisturbing work. He\nregretted that a breakdown\nin communications had\nmeant that students had\nfailed to contact him\ndirectly.

In\na letter to NUS President\nPhil Woolas, Sir Keith\ncondemns racism and\nfac is m. He argues, though,\nthat the policy of some\nstudent unions to deny\nspeaking rights to invited\nspeakers who have been\nbranded as racist is 'wrong,\nmisguided and harmful'. He\nappealed to students to\nprotect freedom of speech\nbefore lasting damage was\ndone to their institutions\nand to the country's political life.

    "content": "South Africa\nAttacked\nDear Hugh,\nI would like to comment on\nseveral remarks made in\nFELIX since my letter on\nSouth Africa in no. 737.\nFirstly, the comment that\napartheid is not an extreme\nright-wing philosophy does\nnot really stand up to any\nserious investigation. Take\nfor example President\nBotha's two immediate\npredecessors, Henrick\nVerwoerd and John\nVorster. During the last\nwar, Verwoerd and his\nnewspaper openly\nsupported Hitler, and\ncampaigned for South\nAfrica to change sides\nduring the war, and had\nlinks with the pro-Nazi\n'Under the Swastika' group.\nVorster, Prime Minister\nuntil the late seventies, was\na General in another pro-Hitler group, the\n'Ossewabrandwag'. These\ntwo men were two of the\nchief architects of the postwar apartheid. Perhaps\nHitler was also an 'ethnic\nsocialist'.\nI was, within these\nhallowed pages, labelled an\n'extremist' for my criticism\nof apartheid's 'reforms',\nespecially of the abolition\nof the Pass laws. My belief\nthat the 'orderly\nurban s at ions' programmes\nreplacing them was nothing\nmore than a political sleigh t of hand was not actually an\nidea of may own invention,\nbut was an opinion\nexpressed in a Leader\ncolumn of that well known\n'Marxist' newspaper\u2014the\n'Jonannesburg Star' (8th April 1986).\nSeveral reasons for\nopposition to sanctions\nhave been expressed in\nrecent weeks. One of these\nwas a fear that sanctions\nwould have a serious effect\non other countries in\nSouthern Africa. This is\nnot, apparently , a fear\nshared by these countries\nthemselves. At a meeting of\nthe 'frontline states' of\nAngola, Botswana,\nTanzania, Mozambique,\nZambia and Zimbabwe in\nLuanda in April, they all\ncalled for the Western\ngovernments to impose\ncomprehensive sanctions\non South Africa.\nI also think that the view\nthat black South Africans\nhave the highest living\nstandard of black Africans\nis false. The infant mortality\nrate, for instance, which\ngives some indication of\nthe conditions in which\nblack families live, is\na or und14%, and in some\nrural communities figures\nas high as 50% have been\nrecorded recently, the\nmajority of which are from\nthings such as mal nut rion, g astro en tir it is and\ntuberculosis\u2014virtually\nunheard of in those parts of\nAfrica not presently\nsuffering from drought, yet\nSouth Africa is a rich\nagricultural country, able to\nexport a wide variety of\nfoodstuff.\nHowever, whether or not\nthey have the highest black\nliving standard in Africa is\nnot the point. The real\ninjustice is the\nastronomical difference in\nthat between black and\nwhite South Africans. That\nshould certainly not be\npreserved.\nShaun Dunlop\nIC Anti-Apartheid Soc\nCanoe\nDefended\nI am chairman of Canoe\nClub. Last week at the\nAGM of the RC C it was\nannounced by Dave\nKingston that certain of the\nmost experienced (high\nspending) clubs are to be\nremoved from any form of\nfinance next year,\neffectively destroying them.\nWe were given only 8 days\nnotice to come up with\njustification for their '\nexistence (timely for the\nstart of exams). Five\noutdoor clubs are on the\nhit list and their effective\nremoval will further harm\nthe image and strength of\nIC as a college with\ninteresting and wide-ranging activities to offer.\nThis sort of approach, if\nencouraged, is likely to\ncontinue.\nWe feel that this is not\nthe way to produce savings\nif this is what the UFC( Union Finance Comm)\nrequires. There was no\nconsultation with clubs\nbefore hand to try and find\nother areas of saving,\nacross the board. There is\nspending amongst clubs\nthat can be eliminated\nwithout ruining the clubs.\nHigher annual club\nsubscriptions would help\ntoo-this is not an\nunjustified request as price\nrises in subscriptions have\nnot in general reflected the\nincreased financial\n'hardships' external to the\nclubs themselves.\nFinally we would like to\npoint out that Canoe Club\nand the other clubs\naffected provide recreation\nthat helps people to\nappreciate the outdoors\nwhich is valuable for such a place as London.\nND Boxa//\n16 Princes Gardens\nLondon SW7 1NE RCC\nDefended\nDear Hugh,\nNow is the time of year that\nICU and its officers (myself\nincluded) goes gently mad.\nFor it is during this term,\nthat we have to find our\nway out of the financial\nmess that next year's budget is in. The 'mess' this\nyear is a budget deficit of\nabout \u00a312,000 for next year.\nThe major act of\nmadness that Union\nFinance Committee (UFC)\nhas nearly committed is an\nact of wanton vandalism of\nICU's superb club\nstructure. It has been\nproposed that the deficit\nshould be made up by\nwithdrawing finance from\nseveral high spending\nclubs. Within my\ncommittee, the clubs which\nhave been named as\npossible targets for this\ndestruction are Balloon,\nCanoe, Caving, Gliding and\nMountaineering clubs.\nThese clubs, which include\ntwo of the oldest university\nclubs in their sports in\nBritain, are highly active\nwith very committed and\ncom potent members. The\nexpertise within these clubs\nhas led to a number of first\nascents of mountains by\nMountaineering Club, the\ndiscovery and exploration\nof South America's deepest\ncave by Caving Club. The\ncommitment of the club\nmembers is immense with\nindividuals spending up to\n30-40 weekends and \u00a31000\na year out of their own\npockets participating\nThe alternative to this\nterrible destruction of clubs\nis an 'across the board' cut.\nThis would spread the\nsuffering, so th t no one\nwould suffer majority and\nlose their sport totally. The\ncut would have very little\neffect in real terms as it\nwould be done on next\nyear's estimates.\nI hope for the support of\nmembers of Imperial\nCollege Union to fight this\ndreadful proposal.\nRemember it could be your\nclub next time.\nYours sincerely\nTim Palmer\nRCC Chairman\nID\n(A Morelowcostfares\nmore\nGo your own wa^\nULU Travel\nimperial College, Sherfield Building,\nPrince Consort Road, London SW7 Tel: 01-581 8882\n\u2014 mA Service of\nJfl&Jtffjam** STA Travel the worlds\n\u2022 * ^ Br^^ \u00ab \u00a3 leading organisation for\nmI Hk\\WB\\7k independent youth and\nm kW \u2022 M^k WP student travel\nTheWorldbeaters 4 0 si^ If you're crossing the finals\nfrontier remember ST A Travel is for;\nGraduates too! s^t^\\ FELIX Friday 23 May 3\n\n"

    "content": "e views Beautiful\nBaby.\nThis week's theme is\nwomen. Because films are\nlargely written and made by\nmen they often portray\nwomen, rarely the key\ncharacters in films anyway,\nin terms of stereotypes and\nall too frequently a misguided, misogynistic\nview this is. Two films\nreleased this week neatly\nillustrate common\nperceptions of women in\nfilm. The first, 9|/2 weeks,\nshows a wholly subservient\ncharacter performing her\nlover's every whim, though\nnot always entirely willing,\nand to be fair she does\nexhibit some independence\nfinally. The second\nconcerns a femme fatale,\nsuitably enough for a French film He Died With\nHis Eyes Open.\n9V2 weeks is the duration\nof the relationship between\nElizabeth, (Kim Basinger),\nand John, (Mickey Rourke).\nJohn is a money lender and\nhis whole attitude is that of\na calm, controlled man\nused to being very much\nin command, so much so\nthat his relationships with\nwomen are sadistic, not\nthat he subjects them to\nphysical pain particularly,\nbut that he humiliates\nthem. His first sentences to\nElizabeth are an ominous\nportent, whilst in an Italian\nrestaurant he tells her of\nsome of the Mafia killings\nthat happened in the seat\nshe is sitting. He enjoys\nprovoking fear in his lovers\nand evidently confuses fear\nand sexual excitement\n(although they both have\nsimilar physical\nmanifestation).\nBecause there is\nsomething in the\nrelationship that Elizabeth\nwants she has to accept\neverything else that goes\nwith it. Although she is a smart businesswoman who\nis too cultivated and too\nbusy for most men, she\nfinds herself intrigued by\nJohn. Slowly she lets him\ntake more and more control\nover her, even in public,\nuntil the point where she\nhas to decide between her\nself-destructive fantasies\nand maintaining her grip on\nreality.\nThe film is very good at\nshowing the desires of the\ncharacters, showing both\nJohn's ability to control,\nand why he chose\nElizabeth; how he knew\nshe'd respond to him, \"I saw myself in you\" and\nElizabeth's interest in\npower and it's symbols, for\nexample using the\nwork, friends, previous\nrelationships and by only\nlearning about John\nthrough what he tells her\nthe film itself tends to\nlinger on the body of Ms\nBasinger and is very much\nfrom a male point of view,\nand this dichotomy\nprevents the film from\nbecoming fully involving.\nTake off your dress.\nMay I blindfold you?'\n'What if I don't want you to?'\n'You can ask me to leave.'\n'I don't want you to leave.'\ntelephone as a device to\nemphasise the distance and\nsolution of these two\ncharacters and also as a symbol of power and\ncontrol. When Elizabeth is\nleft alone in John's apartment, she looks\naround. Not unreasonable,\nbut he then phones to find\nout if she's been a 'nosey\nparker' and reprimands her\nfor so doing.\nWhilst the story is told\nfrom Elizabeth's point of\nview, by revealing\nsomething about her life,\nAlthough it has moments of\ngreat sexuality, passion and\nhumour as well as\nunpleasantness, there is a certain detachment that\nprevents the audience from\nexperiencing all the\nemotions that it should\nfrom this. Further, their\nattitude to Johns sexual\ndeviance is a little\nambivalent, not to say\nambiguous.\nThe ending however is\nvery poignant, when he\nrealises that Elizabeth is\nleaving him John begins to\ntell her about himself and\nhis childhood and tearfully\nconfesses, 'I never counted\non loving you so much', to\nwhich she replies, almost\nas hurt, 'It wouldn't be over\nuntil one of us said stop.\nYou wouldn't say it'.\nBoth Mick Rarke and Kim\nBasinger have infectious\nsmiles but, all credit to\nboth the acting and the\ncasting, Mickey Rarke's is\nthat of a naughty little boy\nlost with a certain\nimpending evil danger\nabout it, where as Kim\nBasinger's smile is\nsubmissive and kiss able, the sort that male fantasies\nare made of.\nThe director Adrian Lyne\nhas a evident passion for\nfilms, 'I want to make films\nthat linger, that audiences\ncare about', and as wi h his\nprevious film, Flashdance\nhe shows an a liking for\nmusic which in this film is\nomnipresent, but not\nobtrusive. He also, along\nwith cinematographer Peter\nBiziou has produced a film\nthat looks wonderful, but I can't help feeling that\nthere's something vaguely\nobscene about unpleasant\nactivities beautifully\nportrayed.

    "content": "New Standard\nFor TV\nA Japaneses suggestion to\nadopt a1125 line standard\ntelevision picture was put\nto the International Radio\nConultative Committee this\nmonth. This would be a significant improvement on\nthe 625-line system we use\nin the UK. The Committee\nhas decided that the high\ndefinition system should\nnot be adopted as standard\nthere is no way of\ntransmitting the signals;\nand no TV sets to receive\nthem?\nThe proposed new\nstandard works on 60\nHertz, or cycles a second.\nUnfortunately the electricity\nsupply in Europe\u2014and\nthree-quarters of the\nworld\u2014works on 50 Hz.\nSecondly, existing\nterrestrial transmitters\ncould not cope with the\nhigh bandwidth required\nfor the high-definition\nsignal. A fundamental law\nof communication is\nHartley's law, which states\nthat the more information\nyou want to send in a given\ntime, the higher your\nbandwidth has got to be.\nExisting TV bands are\nalready crammed with\nvisions, sound, colour and\ntele text information, and\nthe new system would\nnecessitate the use pf\ndirect broadcasting\nsatellites.\nBut the main worry about\nadoption of the standard is\neconomic rather than\ntechnical\u2014the European\nTV industry does not want\nto accept a standard that\nwill guarantee the Japanese\na monopoly in the market.\nThe Europeans are also\nworking on new systems of\ntheir own. Adopting the\nJapanese standard would\nrender all current TV sets\nand recording apparatus\nobsolete.\nresults in a dramatically\nimproved picture quality.\nThe system permits ten\ntimes more colour\ninformation to be\ntransmitted for each of the\nprimary colours, giving\nmuch better colour hues\nand saturation on the\nscreen. The new system\nwould also have a 'Cinemascope' type screen\nwith a width to height ratio\nof 5:3, compared with the\npresent 4:3. The system\nwould also allow stereo\nsound.\nLike many technological\nadvances, high-definition\nTV comes partly from spinoffs from the computer\nindustry: very fast\nmicroprocessor chips allow\nmuch easier mani pu ation of\nthe video signal. There\nhave also been advances in\nTV camera technology.\nHigh-definition TV is\nalready being used to make\nprogrammes and record\nthem. After editing, the\nimages are transferred to 1-inch video tape for ordinary\nbroadcasting on 625 lines.\nThe transmission of\n1125-line signals to viewer's homes is still some way off,\nthough research is under\nway in Japan to produce\nsets to receive the pictures.\nDespite the problems, the\nhigh-definition system does\nhave a lot going for it. It\nallows twice as many\nscanning lines, and more\nthan four times as many\npictures elements, as\nstandard systems. This\nHow TV Works\nTV cameras scan much in the same way as your eye is\nreading these lines: they scan from left to right, with\nrapid fly back between lines, combined with a slower\nvertical movement down the page. This is achieved in a cathode ray tube by applying a high-frequency time\nbase horizontally, and a lower-frequency time base\nvertically. A spot traces out lines on the screen, and the\nintensity of the spot varies from point to point to make\nup a picture.\nTo cover all the picture elements, several hundred\nlines must be produced on the screen. In Britain the\nstandard is 625 lines, and the complete picture is\nscanned 25 times a second. Now 25 pictures a second\nis a low enough frequency to cause visible flicker. To\navoid this, the scene is actually scanned 50 times a second, first the odd lines only, and then the even\nlines. Athough the picture frequency is really only 25\nHz, the time base applied vertically is 50 Hz\u2014the\nfrequency of the domestic electricity supply in most of\nthe world except the US and Japan.\nThis division of the picture into odd and even lines is\ncalled interlacing, and each scan, of half the complete\npicture, is called a field.\nImperial College Women's Club\nSUMME\nDANCE\non Thursday. 12th June\nat 170 Queen's Gate\n7.30pm ll pm Music by the Brunei Academic\nAll-Stars\nFood provided by club members\nDress: Dinner Jacket or Lounge\nSuit\nTickets from Mrs T Shaw, Min\nRes Eng (or phone 560-1782)\nPrice \u00a36 per person (in cl.1 glass of wine).\nFELIX Friday 23 May 7\n\n"
