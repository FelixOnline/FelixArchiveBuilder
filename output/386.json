    "content": "FELIX Michael Williams\nTHE FELIX pilot scheme of producing two issues\nper week is hereby initiated, but I have to emphasise\nthat the idea is purely experimental and in no way\nreflects any kind of long term policy for FELIX. Indeed,\nif the scheme proves to be impracticable then it may be\nscrapped in favour of an eight-page weekly\".\nThe idea behind the scheme is simple: producing a twelve page issue requires the collation (\"putting\ntogether\") of three sheets over 2,200 times. Now with\nexams in the offing, I feel that it is unreasonable to ask\nthe non-sabbatical staff to give up four hours of revision\ntime late on Thursday evening in order to collate FELIX.\nHowever, by producing two four-page issues a week\n(with the occasional eight-pager) the time-consuming\ntask of collating is largely avoided.\nThat is the theory anyway. Fingers crossed on the\npractice!\n8\nA minor dissent has arisen over the reporting of the\nway in which the IC Union delegation voted on the\nAbortion Bill emergency motion at the NUS Llandudno\nconference recently\". Since I was sitting at the Press\ntable and not with the delegation for the whole of the\nconference I am unable to confirm either way. I was told\nof our delegation's voting in good faith by Mrs Gerrard,\nnevertheless Mr Payne insists that he voted for the\nmotion and did not abstain. In light of Mr Payne's subsequent interest in the subject, I am prepared to accept\nthat he did in fact vote for the motion. I apologise for\nany undue em baras s ment which the conference report\nmay have caused him.\nLETTER\nBroad Left Bashing\nPhys ics\n25th April, 1975\nDear Sir,\nYour cynicism at the\nleadership proposed by the\nbroad left at Llandudno in the\nEducation motion is well founded.

Thus the notice was not printed.\nSomeone remarked \" a very shrewd move\" .\nFrench Trip: Mr Branthwaite reported a reciprocal visit had\nbeen made by the French. He had received no help from Council members. The French students did make a nuisance of them-selves.\nCorrespondence:\nA letter has been received from Madeley College of Education\nStudents Union regarding the victim is ation of Mr John Warburton,\na teacher who refused to undertake not to mention the word or\neven make reference to 'homosexuality'.\nA petition of support was handed round for signatures.\nPresident's Business\nThe dispute at Lancaster was outlined and support for the\nstudents at the university there was called for, not only verbally\nbut physically as well. Weeks Hall: Mr Abraham, the PGA O, asked the President to\nmake representations in College Block to see if it would be\npossible to keep Weeks open during the summer for PG' s. Although the President opposed, Council agreed that he should\ndo so. Governing Body/Council Dinner: The dinner as such is now\noff, but some sort of event was considered to be a good idea\nin principle. The President is to per sue this line with College\nBlock with a view to organising some sort of function on June\n20th. Finance: The Union is to ask for a sub vent ion of \u00a382.330\n(compared with \u00a357,820). The claim amounts (with other income)\nto a per capita fee of \u00a320.50 and is based on simply meeting\nincreased costs. Student Residence: The President reported that inflation is\nnow so high that some college authorities intend to review hall\nrents termly instead of annually . He suggested if this were to be\nthe case, then grants too should come under review termly.\nMention was made of the 20 extra places which have been\nallocated to women and the fact that the Union opposed the move.\nIt was suggested that a Working Party should be set up to con-mm\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nGENERAL MEETING May l st1 pm GREAT HALL Motion: Third World\nEMERGENCY UNION MEETING TO DISCUSS THE EEC CONCERT HALL1.00 pm THURSDAY MAY8 TH1975 Should be fun!!\nThere are some rooms\navailable for the rest of the\nsession at Hamlet Gardens.\nThere are some single rooms\navailable also.\nApply to the Residence\nOffice, Room 161 College\nBlock, or to Mr S Crofton,\nMech En gPG STOP PRESS Re: Deputy President's business in\" Council Highlights\"( this page).

Council\ncalls for the reps to take action to oppose the increases in\nGoverning Body In the appropriate manner.\" The President of\nRSMU, Mr Mortimer, had proposed a 'delete all and insert'\namendment asking for the matter to be taken to aUG M, but this\nwas defeated .\nFellowships: It was reported that the Union can now nominate\npersons for election as a Fellow of Imperial College. Joint-Council: It was recommended that this meeting should\nbe structured as I. Normal business. 2.Annual Reports. 3 . Discus sion papers. The meeting will start at 2.30pm. The Rector has\nbeen asked to attend the latter part of the meeting, which one\nmember described as going \"Down memory lane.\"\nPG Conference: The PGA O gave a verbal report of this\nconference, the major topic of which concerned the status of PG' s. Hon. See's Business\nInsurance: Concern was expressed that students might not be\nwilling to pay the \u00a32 that they are now expected to pay for full\ninsurance coverage.\nReciprocal agreements: About 800 of these have been sent\nout and around 50 have been received back so far. One institution\ndid not wish to be held liable. Their application was therefore\nrejected. It was determined that reciprocal agreements do extend\nto Life members.\nBadminton Club: The Hon.

Next year it will contain a photograph.'\nParking: Many cars have been reported parking in Union\ndesignated areas illegally . The matter is to be taken up at the\nParking Committee.\nFinance:\nThe financial statement was presented by Dr Weale. An item,\nthe External Affairs Committee figure, was missing. The E AO said\" I 've been purged by the bureaucracy.\"\nDeputy President's Business:\nThe DP reported that the clock on level V2 had been replaced.\nSomeone pointed out that the clock had been removed. The DP's comment was\" Who' s bleed in' nicked it??\"\nPots: There is to be a new shelf for pots in the Union Bar.\nThere was inconclusive discussion on pots, defunct pots, number of pots, presence of personal pots.\nMaintenance: There was a request to transfer \u00a3150 from the\ngeneral account into this account. This was agreed.\nUnion Cleaning: The DP asked to spend \u00a3500 on cleaning the\nUnion Building. Council approved.\nCollege Safety Committee: Health & Safety at Work Act. The\nDP highlighted the fact that students are considered as neither\nemployers nor employees. They feature in this legislation simply\nas members of the public. The important ramifications which\nstem from the Act were outlined. Council resolved to support the\nDP's view that there should be a College Safety Officer.\nPublications Board Minutes:\nRadio: Council agreed that ic radio could use the P.A. system\nin the Union and Southside for a trial period of one term. The\nExec is to keep this constantly under review. The move to incorporate advertising, however, was rejected.\nStudent Residence Report:\nCouncil agreed in principle to the setting-up of a Union\nLaundry, but felt that College should pay for it. The report on\nthe Accommodation Conference was referred back on a vote by\n11 votes to 10.\nCampaigning Procedures:\nThe Hon. Sec. presented her paper which outlined various\naspects of campaigning procedure (this refers to comp aig ning for\nthe sabbatical posts ana DP) which were thought to be desirable.\nThere followed general discussion. A J0.B. The Student Residence Officer, Mr Salisbury, presented a motion concerning the selection procedure for residents in Hamlet\nGardens. It called for a preservation of the present system of\nselection \u2014 apparently at the warden's personal discretion \u2014 for\nthis year and then put down new rules and regulation next year,\nthe motion was rejected.\nThe Editor of FELIX, Mr Williams, proposed that, in light of\nthe time-wasting often associated with procedural motions being\nmoved by reference to the numbering listed in standing orders,\nCouncil should in future refer to a procedural motion (or any\nstanding order) by its content and not by its number. Council agreed.\nThe meeting was adjourned at 12.20am( the guillotine having\nbeen suspended at 11 pm).\n\n"

No.386 WEDNESDAY( Surprise, surprise), 3 0 TH APRIL,1975.20 MORE RESIDENCE PLACES FOR WOMEN \u2014\nSEX DISCRIMINATION?\nVAT ERROR IN 1973, Joseph Murray, Warden of the Allen Hall of Residence\n(University of Manchester) refused to charge VAT on guest room\nfees during term time. The Government'sV AT Commissioners\ndisagreed with his attitude and took him to court. The resulting\nVAT Tribunal upheld the Warden's decision and ruled that no VAT is payable on guest room fees on a student area during term time. This came to light when the\nDeputy President, Ron Kill, was reading through the quarterly newsletter of the\nAssociation of College Wardens\nCollege Block Renamed College Block, the administrative core of the college\nwhich was opened in December\n1969 by the Queen, is to be\nre-named at last. It is to be called \"The\nSheffield Building\" in recognition of Lord Sherfield's services\nto the College as Chairman of\nthe Governing Body from 1962 \u2014\n1974. One suspects that the\nCollege was waiting for a prominent College dignitary to\neither die or leave before any\nre-naming would take place,\nbut that is just sheer spec ul ation .\nAdditionally, the new hostel\nblock which was completed at\nthe College Field Station,\nSilwood Park, in February 1974\nis to be named \"William Penney\nHall\" in recognition of Lord Penney's long association with\nthe College as a student, staff\nmember and Rector from 1967 \u2014\n1973.\nin the absence of the Ti zard Hall Warden, Dr Geoff Evans. The legal reference for the\ncase is1 VAT TR331973 and\nit is clear that the case was\ncontested in1973. The guests\nof students at IC, however,\nhave been paying VAT on guest\nrooms throughout the session.\nIt is obvious that the College\nBlock financial machinery has\nslipped up somewhere along\nthe line. The College's popular\n' VAT man', Terry Door is, left\nCollege at the end of last term\nso there is a state of confusion\nas to how this all happened.\nUndertakings have been\ngiven that this unfortunate\nsituation will be sorted out.\nBut in the meantime, all those who have been charged\nVAT on guest room fees are\nentitled to a refund.\nTHE COLLEGE has decided to raise the proportion of\nwomen in residence (halls and houses)from 10.7% to 12.3%.\nThis has resulted from the al location of twenty of the thirty-nine new places, which will be available from next October,\nto women.\nIt is College policy to align\npercentage of women in residence with the percentage of\nwomen at the College. If this is to be the case, then on present\nfigures there will have to be\nnearly 100 more women at IC next year, making a total of\nover 500. It appears that in recent years, a greater proportion of students have been\nwomen than the estimated\nfigures on which the allocation of places was based. ( Last year is being quoted as an\nexception since 10.7% of air residents in halls and houses\nwere female whereas they only\nformed 10.1% of the College). However it would seem that\neven allowing for this, an\nincrease of2025% in the female\ncontingent of the College is a major over estimation. Lady Anne Thome, the\nSenior Tutor for women, was approached by FELIX. On our\nsuggestion that it would appear\nthat women were clearly going\nto be given greater preference\nthan men, she replied with\nthree points: firstly, the number\nof women at College does have\na general upwards trend;\nsecondly, a high percentage of\nRI Z IS THE NEW DP YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, Ri z Shakir, currently the\nFeatures Editor of FELIX, was\ndeclared elected to the post of\nDeputy President of IC Union for the next academic session. Despite the fact that there\nwere two fully proposed candidates when the nomination\npapers came down on Monday,\nMr Shakir was nevertheless\ndeclared elected when his opponent, Graham Paterson, withdrew from the election. The result has generally\nreleased sighs of relief from\ncertain sectors of the Union who were convinced that if the\nelection went to a ballot, it would certainly have been\nin quo rate and thus necessitated\nyet another election . The election is, of course, subject\nto ratification at the next U GM. women are fresher s, who therefore tend to soak up a lot of\nplaces at the expense of second\nand third years; and thirdly;\nfar more female than male PG' swish to have to rooms in residence so once again they would\ntend to soak up the women's allocation at the expense of the\nsecond and third years. Thus\nthe admitted \" over estimation\" is to help out the second and\nthird years.\nThe opponents of this\nscheme say that it is ill-planned\nand that it does not take into\naccount many aspects of the\nresidence situation. The point was made that women\nmuch prefer single rooms than\ndouble rooms (are fewer single\nrooms going to be available to\nmen?) and that on the whole\nthere is a far wider range of\nalternative accommodation\nfacilities available for women\nthan for men.\nThere seems to be a general\nfeeling of disapproval amongst\nthe men at IC and the Union\ndid, in fact, oppose the move\nbut to no avail. When asked to comment,\nBill Gerrard, the Warden of\nMining House said\"/ feel a little disappointed that Lady\nAnne Thome did not take the\ntrouble to personally consult\nenough people on this matter.\nThere are still some uncertainties as to how the scheme may\nbe implemented in practical\nterms.\"\nThe final Union view on the\nmatter was the expectation that\nthe places will not all be filled next year. A request is to be\nmade for letting men into the\nvacant rooms if this turns out\nto be the case.\n\n"

In doing so it also demonstrates the whole range of electronic music from the production of the\nsounds similar to conventional instruments, through wie rd drifting mood music\n(reminiscent of Tangerine Dream's work),\nto sound effects and other unholy noises. Each track is credited to an individual\ncomposer. My favourite is \" Roman es can Rout\" in which the stereo facility,\nsound effects, and music similar to that\nproduced by conventional instruments\nare all merged to good effect.\nAn interesting album.\nHie\nRoy Buchanan: Rescue Me (Polydor)\nIN SOME circles Roy Buchanan Is\nregarded as the new guitar-hero, though\nnot necessarily agreeing with his\nassertion himself \u2014 and rightly so. On\nthis album he displays an extensive,\nimpressive control of his instrument with\nhis blues upbringing always to the fore,\nand an imagination not far behind the\ntechnique. He produces streams of fluid\nguitar phrases as easily as a jagged\nstaccato run from within a welter of\nsoulful brass and percussion (as on the\ntrack). All this however is marred by the\nuse of tunes lagging 10 or 20 years\nbehind the times, featuring such excessively drawn-out blues jams as \" C.C. Ryder\" and various numbers that should\nhave been locked In the closet ages ago.\nObsolete sounds do not sell records and\nRoy Buchanan's reputation should take a pounding for allowing such mediocrity to\nbe released . This, his 4th album, might\njust as well be his 100th for all it's innovations. It stands simply as a replica\nof the other three. It's a pity that his\nroots are embedded in the overgrown soil of the past, because his ability could\nhave made him an important musician. He has chosen his \" me tier\" however\nand these days pure blues have very\nlittle to say. Tom Abraham\nDavid McLellan: Marx (Fontana)\nNEITHER die-hard anti-communists\nnor committed marxists will find this\nbook pleasant reading. McL ell an tries to\nde mystify the prophet Marx, and to some\nextent he succeeds. Contrary to popular\nbelief Marx was more of a socio-economic\nanalyst rather than a latter-day Jeremiah.\nHis prolific writings, immense in scope,\nportray a highly intellectual mind\nattempting to grasp the essentials of\nhuman society and life. Marx's attempts\nto provide a cohesive and total image of\nhumanity seems to have failed, because\nhe was patently unable to draw all the\ndifferent strands of his own philosophical, social and economic thought\ntogether. This task was left to his\ndisciples who seemed only interested in\ngrafting their own ideas onto the body of\nMarxist philo so py. However, on\u00bbinteresting side effect has been the\ncontroversy about how much Marx was\ninfluenced by Hegelian philosophy.\nMcL ell an seems to side with the George\nLukain school of thought in maintaining\nthat both Marx's earlier and latter\nwritings were influenced by Hegel's concept of man's\" alienation\". To some extent McL ell an may be right, but\none cannot help but suspect that as a Marxian scholar who is deeply involved\nin his subject, he is trying to project his\nown liberal humanist beliefs onto the\nmarxist philosophy that he writes about.\nSummer Vacation\nAccommodation 1975.\nAccommodation will be available from 30th June - 16th September 1975 for Imperial\nCollege students and staff in the Halls of\nResidence, Student Houses and Student\nUnion Flats (mainly shared rooms).
