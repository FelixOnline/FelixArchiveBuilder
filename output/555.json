    "content": "College is for study\nor Profits?\nSome of the visiting French school kids, on campus to eat in Southside, tried to\nset fire to car roofs and the ladies toilet\nover the long weekend. Furthermore, the\ncommotion caused was again unacceptable\nat a time of revision just prior to exams.\nOver the past weeks the number of\nthese parties, with an age range of\nthirteen to seventeen, has increased rapidly. Whilst they may be staying in a nearby hotel during their sight-seeing trip\nto London, they eat their lunch and evening meals here. The arrangement is\nthrough S company which prints and distributes Diners Cards to the continent.\nA card gives the holder food to the value\nof \u00a31.25 in the Southside Refectory.\nThe scheme was introduced some time\nago in order to increase refectory revenue. However, for those in Southside\nthe situation became intolerable.\nSince the beginning of term there have\nbeen 150 or so eating their meals here.\nTwo problems arise. Firstly at lunchtime\nlarge queues of kids stretched to the door\nof the refectory, immediately putting off\nIC students who would have eaten there.\n(Some of the refectory staff tried to see\nthat students went first.) In the evening,\nwith the parties often unsupervised, Southside became a playground. Once inside they ran up and down the stairs to\nthe annoyance of, amongst others, the\nsecurity guard. Outside in the car park\narea and beside the mews tens of kids let\noff steam after a day cooped up in the\ncoach. This lead to an un predicted level\nof complaints from students to the wardens, sub wardens and Union. It has\nalso led to friction with the Mews residents, one even went to the extent of\ntaking photos.\nThe Refectory Suggestions Committee\nraised the matter at the Refectory Committee. The problem was not understood by those who did not know the\nfacts and of course the 'profit' from these\nkids was the over-riding factor. Anyway they decided it would be a good idea asking the kids to be quiet! The same day\nthe evening commotion lasted until nine\no 'clock. The French teachers complained\nto the refectory staff whilst their kids played havoc with those revision time-tables. Matters were left with two members of the Refectory Committee who tried to keep order.\nSince then the Union Council decided\nthat \"no profit making venture must be at\nthe expense of normal life\" and that\nincludes revision in one's room. This is\nin line with the Pratt Report of some years back, written after complaints from\ntechnicians that conference bookings were upsetting their own refectory outlets. The Union's letter to Dr RC Schroter demanded that the scheme be\ndropped or that alternative arrangements\nbe made. \u2022 It also pointed out that there\nwere other ways that the prices could be\nbrought down, which were not against the\nruling of the Pratt Report.\nMr Mooney and Dr Schroter have been\nendeavour ing to develope a solution to\nthe problem which will be acceptable to\nus. To this end a number of actions have\nbeen taken:\n1. No bookings between 1st and 13th June have been accepted. We are\ncommitted, however, to a couple on the\n5th and 6th June. We are also commited\nto a considerable number during the last\nweek of May.\n2. Mr Mooney has agreed that, with the\nexception of the weekend times and\nprovided there is no clash with the dinner\nbookings in the Sherfield Building, both\nlunches and dinners will be served to the\nvisitors in the Sherfield Building rather\nthan Southside. It is unfortunately not\npossible to use this approach on the\nweekends for obvious reasons.\n3. The Central Organisers and the\nParty Organisers have been, and are\nbeing, repeatedly contacted to warn them\nof the importance of decorous behaviour\nand a letter has been produced in French\nwhich is given to each tour party leader\ninstructing them exactly what to do.\n4. Finally, at the Refectory's expense\nstudent marshall s are being sort for to\nhelp control the students.\nAt the time of writing it is unclear exactly how successful the scheme is\nfrom a student viewpoint. It is after all\nnecessary for a member of the refectory\nstaff to go over to Southside and marshall\nthem to Sherfield and one can never be\nsure when they will turn up. So there is\nan extra burden on the staff and the necessity\nto open Sherfield in the evenings. This\nmeans a decrease in the 'profit' margin,\nbut on this point it should be said that no\nfigures have been present to show that\nthis 'profit' is absolutely necessary.\nSo after three weeks of hassles it\nseems that College have accepted that\nCollege life comes first and the responsibility for the guest falls on those who invite a guest into College.\nThree weeks which led to much complaints, extra work for the wardens in\nSelkirk and K eogh,an d trouble for the\nSub wardens who tried to control the\nchildish actions of a small minority of our\nstudents, and a serious threat of arson.\nHopefully sanity has now returned and\nthat this is a lesson to many. For we all\nunderstand that non academic services\nmust not lose College money, but this\nshould not be at the expense of academic\nand acceptable college life. Failure of the\nrefectories to realise the difficulties did\nput a question mark on many things.\nHowever, what happens now is somewhat unclear, Dr RC Schroter hopes\nthat \"the actions taken will both relieve\nthe tension between residents and others,\nand will retain some means of raising\nfunds to help underwrite catering costs.\"\nAfter all, his task is a difficult and vert u ally impossible one.\nMr Mooney is quoted as saying: the\ntrouble it brings, it just isn't worth it.\"\nPG AGM THURSDAY 12th JUNE\n1:00pm in the\nSENIOR COMMON ROOM Papers in the Lower Lounge.\nBarrel of real ale available.\nSICK?\nDISGUSTING?\nPERVERTED?\n// you know any ;'or ces answering this\ndescription, send them to Dave Jago,\nRag Mag Editor, c/o The Felix Office,\nor tell me in person.\nPint reward for the vilest, but 'nice'\njokes also considered.\n2\n\n"

    "content": "REVIEWS THE GREENPEACE CHRONICLE\nBy Robert Hunter\nAt 11:00am on 6th November 1971, Bering Sea time, James R Schlesinger gave the 'go', triggering a nuclear phenomenon\nwhose force was measured at five megatons, flaming to the\ntemperature of the sun, instant e ou sly carving a cavern the size of\nfour football fields in diameter out of what had before been solid\nAleutian rock.\nRare peregrine falcons and bald eagles sitting on rock ledges\nhad their legs driven up through their bodies. Some one thousand\nsea otters died in the Bering Sea, their ears split by the\nshockwave, their wet brown bodies left to wash up on the shore\nfor weeks afterwards.\n\"Everything has gone as expected,\" was the offical statement.\nAn emotive passage; the book the nuclear tests on the Aleutian\nis full of them. At times the\nsentimentality goes a little over\"\nthe top. The book is full of\nromantic images; facing the\nharpoons of the Russian whalers;\nstanding over baby Harp seals;\nsailing into nuclear test zones.\nAn organisation born of the\nWest Coast hippie movement\nin Pacific Canada; founded on\nuniversal love and concern, driven by emotion and showman\nflair; the Greenpeace movement\nhas been at the forefront of\n\"emotion conservation\", cuddly\nseal pups, majestic leviathans.\nRight or wrong is not for me to\njudge. It was effective. It still is\nand makes a great story.\nThe \"chronicle\" traces the\nbeginnings of the movement through the personal view of\none man, a reporter by trade,\nwho was in at the beginning\nand became the president for a while. The documentary approach drags in places, but contrasts with highs of emotional\nfrenzy.\nIt began with opposition to\nIslands, off Alaska. It follows\nthe isolated beginnings, a lone\nfishing smack sailing through i the North Pacific winter to\" bear witness\" at the bomb tests.\nThe cause of the whale, and the exponential growth of\naffiliated groups.\nThe Canadian hunts and the\nfamous clubbing seals campaign.\nAnd then\nThe book stops curiously. By1977 the group had realised a large membership, and was fragmenting into numerous factions pulling in different directions. It signalled the end\nof Robert Hunter's involvement\nwith Greenpeace.\nGreenpeace still exists.\nIn other hands.\nThe irony of the British edition of the book is that the\ncover depicts a composite with\nthe \" Rainbow Warriqr\"; a ship\nfunded by the European Green peace in 1978 meriting only a. final paragraph on page 240.\nDW The story of a desperate, courageous and inspired attempt to\nstem the tide of destruction on this planet\nRobert Hunter was born in 1941. He was ecology correspondent\nand columnist on the Vancouver Sun where he became involved\nin the original protests over the Aleutian nuclear tests. He was a founder member of Greenpeace and for some time its President.\nCOTTON WOOL AND\nSAXOPHONES\nYoung Marble Giants/Essential Logic\nThe Nashville\nNorth End Road\nFriday 23rd May London SW5\nDear Sid\nSaw the Young Marble Giants I can recommend them whole-hearted ly, and I'm going to try to\ncatch them next time they play\nwithin striking distance. As you\nprobably know from listening to the\nalbum they're a sort of sparse,\nminimalist reggae ish band with the\ngaps in the music being as important\nas the notes in between. There's only three of them: Phil Moxham,\norgan and guitar (puts in the\nbrilliant little touches); Stuart\nMoxham, bass and organ (keeps\nthe whole show running \u2014 well,\nsort of trolling along anyway);\nAlison Statton, vocals (sounds as if\nshe's singing to herself, looks\ntotally unlike yer average lady\nfront person, none of this fancy\nclothes, tight trousers rubbish, she\nlooks the sort of girl you want to\ndrag off stage and wrap in cotton\nwool to protect her from the\nnas ties). They use a rh y,. im box\ninstead of a drummer, but blend\naround it so well that it's not\nobtrusive, and succeed in producing\nfar more interesting and varied\nrhythms than the likes of After the\nFire, Gary Numan and New Musik.\nThe organ had a lovely 'warm'\nsound and considering only one\neffects pedal was used during the\nset, they produced a hell of a range\nof guitar sounds. The songs are\nvery impressive, and despite the\nstark way they're presented, they\nare actually quite 'catchy'.\nAll in all, like nobody I'd ever\nheard before, and they seemed to\nenjoy it as much as we did. Jeremy\nand I sang along, Pinball bopped\naway merrily, Dave Jago tapped his\nfeet and swayed about a bit, and\neven Steve Marshall and Simon\nTurner enjoyed it.\nLogic were disappointing. They\nused (way back in the mists of\ntime, ie, last year) to have all these\nunexpected rhythm changes and so\non, and I used to get drenched in\nsweat bopping away at the front at\nLogic gigs. Not so this time, I merely worked up a mild flush (or\nthereabouts), they just weren't as\ninfectious somehow. The new bass\nplayer, John, an ex-bus ker( doesn't sing with them, but he's got a phenomenal voice, if I remember\ncorrectly), anyway where was I? He's a brilliant bassist, the original\nfive fingers and a thumb job, but he\ntakes over the sound too much.\nLora's sax playing was somewhat\nstaid, and looking back on it the\nnews songs are too polished,\nthough I'd say they still knock\nspots off most bands around.\nPinball said they'd become too\naccomplished and lost whatever it\nwas they used to have. He'd seen\nthem on Thursday as well, and said\nthey were worse then. They still\nseem to care about the audience\nthough. I don't know if it was\ncoincidence, but during a gap while\nthey were fixing a snare drum, I asked the bass player to get them\nto play Wake Up 'cause I had to\ngo before the set finished and it\nwas down on the song list (im prudently placed on the stage just in\nfront of me) as the last song (this\nsentence is appalling!) and they\nplayed it as their next song. Nice,\neh! I had to miss the end of the set\nto go off and do this 'ere radio\nprogramme, but apparently some\npea-brained imbecile of a skinhead\nsprayed the stage with a fire\nextinguisher (and the band played\non!). He was probably a relative of\nthe mindless excrement that beat\nsomeone up in this toilets during\nthe interval. It seems to me that\nthere's at least as much trouble at\nthe Nashville as there ever was,\ndespite their ridiculous 21+ only\nrule.\nAnyway, a fun time was had by\nnearly all. See the Young Marble\nGiants if you can, and Essential\nLogic have still got what it takes\neven if they're not showing it too\nmuch at the minute. Got to pack\nup writing now 'cause the records\ncoming to an end and if I don't set\nthe next one off there'll be an\nem baras sing pause.\nCheers\nEric O 'Cola\n7\n\n"

    "content": "LETTERS Dear Sir\nOn reading this week's FELIX I thought that all the varieties of S Imperialis had been described on\npage three, only to find a sixth\nmanifesting itself on page four! I refer of course to S Imp pseudo-intellectual is, yes \u2014 Justin'wounded'\nNewland was at it again.\nAs the readers of FELIX are by\nnow all too painfully aware, JN considers that a scribe of his\ncalibre may by Divine Right inflict\nupon a fortunate readership any\nsuch drivel he might feel 'inspired'\nto write. Are we not 'privileged' to\nbe allowed such glimpses of the\ninsights of so stimulating a historian-philosopher as Mr Newland right\nhere in our own little paper?\nThere'are just two flaws in what\nMr N calls his 'literary style'. The\nDear Justin Newland\nAnyone whose prose is published\ncan expect to receive criticism. It is\nthe writer's responsibility to sift\nthrough comments on his work\nand find the valid complaints and\nlearn from them, also to reply to\nthose points that require a rejoinder.\nIt is not his duty to compound any\noriginal felony by insulting those\nwho make perfectly reasonable\ncomments on his style.\nAs to the confinement of \"aesthetic\ncomments\" (your phrase, not mine)\nto the issue of the matching of\nstyle to content, I believe that in\nsome dim and distant era the essay\nwas considered as a highly respected\nart form. Incidentally an art form\nthat Miss Anne Marie Tomsett\n(one of the recipients of your\ntongue's sharper edge, last week) is\nadept at to the extent of jointly\nbeing awarded the Arthur Acland\nEssay Prize, only a year or so ago.\nJustin, dearest heart, of course\nyou may use metaphor, simile and\nany literary embellishment save\nclich e; but try not to be verbose,\nand, please try to use embellish-first of these is that he has nothing\nto say, the second that he doesn't know when to stop saying it.\nLanguage is supposed to be an\ninstrument of communication, not\na' smoke screen' for ignorance. If\none has nothing to say then say\nnothing!\nWorse than the quantity of\nverbal diarrhoea which Mr N has\nbeen able to produce is the actual\nnature of it. The 'points' made by\nhim in both of the writings printed\nby FELIX over the past three\nweeks do not bear the hallmarks of\nan informed historian trying to\ncapture the truth from the facts in\nthe most concise possible combination of well chosen words, as I suspect Mr N would like to think\nthey do. Instead they betray him as\na bigot who has taken it upon\nhimself to judge a culture worlds\nment s to accentuate the points you\nwish to make, not merely to show\noff. Clarity and economy are more\nimportant components of an\narticulate style of writing than any\nmere embroidery.\nYour vocabulary is admittedly\nextensive, but there is the world of\ndifference between using an unfamiliar word because it exactly, conveys\nthe meaning intended (or because\nit allows a little alliteration or\notherwise sounds nice), and using a word because you looked it up in a dictionary this morning and thought\nit looked obscure. FELIX is a magazine, not a 'crib sheet' for Call\n\u2022My Bluff.\nAs to the content of your articles,\nmy world weary eyes find them\ninvariably naive and insufferably\npompous (as would eyes more\ncynical, find my, so far unwritten,\nopinions of world politics, the\nhuman situation, life, the universe,\nand everything).\nAt the risk of provoking the\nderision and hostility of some of my\napart from his own purely by his\nown standards and, furthermore,\nas an ill-informed 'p seu d' who\nattempts to force square historical\nfacts into round present-day\nsituations.\nIf Mr N is ever to make future\ncontributions to FELIX or any\npublication (not I trust without\ncareful consideration on his part)\nthen if he wishes to be treated with\nrespect at all he will have to\nacquire that most elusive of virtues,\nnamely humility. I would strongly\nrecommend to him that such a deflation of his over-sensitive ego\nwould quickly rid his writing of the\novertly patron<sing and pointlessly\nsarcastic tone which make him so\noffensive to those who have to\nread the crap.\nPerhaps Mr N believes that some\nof what he has written is worthwhile \u2014\nhis 'solution' to the US/ Iran readers, I will couch my concluding\nmarks in a figure of speech (not to\nmention rip them off directly from\nthe end of last week's epistle).\nIt is only when every author's belief in the English language, or\nsome other medium embodying the\nprinciples of communication, has\nbeen nourished by the rains of time\nthat the flower of universal style\nand art icu lacy will prosper.\nUntil then we must endure the\nstench of clich e, the sickness of the\ncumbersome sentence, the confusion\nof millions, and the most nauseous\nsight on this earth . . . the bickering\nof writers.\nCheers, etc\nEric Jarvis\nTHE HUXLEY CLUB The Huxley Club was formed in\n1979 by a group of IC graduates\nwho have entered the teaching\nprofession. The objects of the Club\nare to establish and maintain contact between IC graduates now\nteaching and to create a closer and\nmore abiding link between their\nschools and the College than otherwise exists.\nThe Club meets twice a year:\nduring the winter for an Annual\nDinner, usually in London, and\nagain in the summer for a more\ninformal gathering outside Lorfdon,\nat which guests are welcome.\nMembership is open to any ex-IC\ngraduate or postgraduate now\nteaching.

As well as the close lias on due to the fact we are its sole source of\nincome, we hope to involve the engineering\nstudents in the design aspect.\nAlso at the meeting the officers for next year\nwere elected, as follows:\nSecretary: Alan Edwards\nJunior Treasurer: Jon Davis\nPublicity Officer: Steve Tyson\nRag Mag Editor: Dave Jago\nI am sure they will all do a great job, and\nwish them, and Ian Hodgson, the new Chairman, every success for next year.\nHOWEVER, if you think that there's no life\nleft in this year's officers, you couldn't be more\nwrong, because we also found out at the\nmeeting that we've raised just over \u00a318,000 and\nwith that magic number 20,000 within our\ngrasp, we just couldn't resist it.\nSO, on Saturday 14th June there will be a Final Fling Collection, giving you your last\nchance this year to do your bit for an\nextremely worthwhile cause. The collection will\nbe run from all C CU offices, with a 'Life oi\nBrian' theme (although you can do any other\nstunt if you like) and there will be a free party\nin the evening for everyone who has helped.\nBut if you can't be there on the day, don't just put it out of your mind \u2014 there are plenty\nof other ways of making money, whether its a sponsored event by your club, society or Hall,\nselling Rag Mags or a small collections: around\nthe departmental staff perhaps, or just round a few local pubs when out with your mates (you\ncould even have a sponsored revision!). Really\nthere are lots of ways in which you can have\nfun and raise money at the same time, so if\nyou want to help, please contact me via IC\nUnion Office, or your C CU, and we'll supply\ncans, licences, sponsor forms or anything else\nyou need. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE think\nabout it, and make an effort \u2014 even if you\nonly collect for half an hour you'll be helping us\nto help up to about twenty more deaf children\nthis year.\nRAE "

It was written by\nthe Warden, Dr Carabine.\nThe notice stated that there\nhas been a very serious incident\nresulting in two broken windows\nand considerable distress to\nresidents in the Mews houses\nbehind the Hall.\nPolice are investigating the\ndamage, believed to have occurred on Saturday night. It\nmay well be shown that objects\nwere thrown from L instead Hall. The Warden said that the\nresult could easily have been\nserious or fatal injury.\nThere is little evidence as yet\nto imply involvement of Linstead\n\u2022 Hall, but even if the police enquiry is inconclusive, the Warden fears that the Hall will\nremain under suspicion. Dr Carabine said that it is hard to\nimagine anything worse for the\nreputation of IC students in the\nneighbourhood.\nDrC arab in e asked that students should let him know immediately if they heard any\nunusual noise in or outside the\nHall at about 2:00amon Sunday\nmorning.( People who have already seen the Warden or Sub-wardens need not repeat.)\nThrowing material from Linstead Hall will be routinely\nfined from now on.

As the extras score\nraced along, Guy Simpkins and Andy\nHarris played some attacking strokes. After\nSimpkin was dismissed for 22, Harris took\ncontrol of the innings and soon reached 50.\nHe continued playing with devil and\npanache and punished the bowling to\nreach his century in less than 100 minutes\nbefore finally being dismissed for 110,\nwhich included 14 fours and a six. Harris\nwas ably supported by Eckersley (21) and\nMaquire (12no). At tea, IC declared at 200\nfor 6.\nBorough Road, showing ail the aggressiveness of a stuffed parrot, made no\nattempt to chase IC's total. Their negative\napproach to the game ensured a long and\nboring innings which, at the close of play,\nstood at 77 for 5. However, the IC bowlers\nwere unlucky not to bowl-out the agri-culturally-minded Borough Road hackers.\nRatnam took 1 for 23 for 15 off 9 and\nSimpkin was unfortunately unable to\npurchase a wicket with his daisy cutters.\nResult: a moral victory to IC by a wide\nmargin!\nIdvad Ratles\nposters\nDear Colin\nThough I may have become short-tempered while revising, I feel\nthat it is still a quite reasonable\nreaction to be enraged by a number\nof posters I have seen about the\ncollege. The thin end of the wedge\nwas a poster depicting a mushroom\ncloud rising from a cooling tower.\nHow subtle! What breath-taking\nimagery! Close study revealed that\nthe power station using the towers\nwas not included in the picture.\nCircumstantical evidence would\nsuggest that the hidden power station was not nuclear. Dumb posters do not contribute to the\nnuclear debate. I heartily congratulate whoever took any of them\ndown.\nToday Is awan even worse\nexample. Published by Ecoropa, it\nis called \"Nuclear Power \u2014 The Facts\". A lively little poster, it has a short introduction and then twenty-three questions and answers. The intro hints that the nuclear industry\nis a conspiracy of psychopathic\nfaceless businessmen out to poison\nas many people as they can while\nbeing paid lots of money to build\nengines of di struct ion( or power\nstations as the non-ecologically\nminded sometimes call them). Are the men of B NFL and UK A EA freemasons? Or perhaps illuminati?\nOf the twenty three questions which follow, numbers 22 and 23\nare answered quite reasonably.\nThe rest are answered with a patchwork of irrelevancy, answers\nwhich mislead by telling some of\nthe truth but not all of it, and the\noccasional statement which is just\nnot true. Some answers are cunning,\nothers insult the intelligence of the\nreader. I will not go into details, so\nas to shorten the letter (already\noverlong), but will in a subsequent\nletter if whoever put the post up\nwrites an answer to this letter in\nFELIX.\nPerhaps he or she is the same\nperson who put up poster number\n3. It is titled \"Studies of the Human\nAura\" and is a hideous example of\nthe reconciliation of Biblical fundamentalism with modern science\nschool of thought. I need not describe it in detail, as they have\nproliferated around College like an\nintellectual cancer. It appears to\nrefer to the relation between the\nSCAB AGM At the SCAB AGM on Tuesday,\nthe election for Chairman was very\nclosely contended between Nick\nMoran and Fiona Sinclair, the post\nbeing won by Fiona.

The latter contains material\nfrom other operettas by the composer. Imperial Opera presented the original score with a new translation by Geoffrey\nDunn, which (Iam assured) is faithful to the original, and in\nplaces quite hilarious. The plot concerns, on its surface, the events leading up to the Trojan War, but is in fact a satire on decadent Parisian society in the 1860s, with a High Priest cheating\nat cards and an Orestes surrounded by ladies of doubtful virtue\n(not including his sister). the humour in the lines. Mike Imperial Opera is a company Withers did the honours with\nnewly-formed by current and ex members of IC Operatic Society, mostly graduates of IC or various music colleges. In\nfact, a group of very talented\nand experienced singers and musicians. There was sufficient\nvocal talent to 'double-up' the\nprincipal parts, with Penny Beavan and Deborah Johnson singing Helen on alternate evenings and Brian Parsons alternating as Paris with Terry Newcombe. Production and designs were\nadded some topical references\nand stage business to enhance\nthe baton, and Ann Alderson produced elaborate costumes\nfrom a tiny budget (no student\nunion subsidies, of course!). Last but not least, a crowd of\nex-stage managers were mani pula ting screwdrivers and paint brushes to provide scenery\nand paddle-steamer (complete\nwith smoking chimney).\nWithout any possible doubt\nwhatever, a successful first major production for the Imperial\nOpera company and a suitable\nchoice for Offenbach's centenary\nyear.\nD Everett\n9\n\n"
