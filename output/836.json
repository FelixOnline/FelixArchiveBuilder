    "content": "Music\nMUSIC We've heard some foul rumours\nthat you got your name from a Spanish crisp packet...\nThat's one of the lies, yes, certainly.\nHow long have you been together?\nAbout eight months\u2014we signed in\nNovember.\nWere you surprised at your sudden\nsuccess?\nAf. first, yes, because we thought\n'crummy little \u00a3120 demo...' it's very\nsurprising to see it competing with Jason\nDonovan, but after a while we thought,\nwell, we are much better than f as on Donovan, so it's good that it's there, it\nshould go higher, although I don't think\nit will.\nHow do you react to Bruno Brooks\nplaying your record regularly on Radio One?\nWhy not? Yes, it's good. I 'll leave it\nthere. (Gives a stylised snort y laugh.)\nWhy did you sign to Food Records?\nTo be boring, because we felt they were\nthe best record company. They have all\nthe advantages of being an\nindependent\u2014there's two people\nrunning it, and we're the third band on\nthe label, and so we have all that\nattention, but then we have the backing\nof the mighty EMI, who handle all the\ndistribution and promo stuff, while the\nartistic side is all worked out with Food.\nSo it's the*best of both worlds.\nDid you get many other offers?\nWe didn't really hang around long\nenough, because Food would take us out,\nget us drunk and kiss us a lot\u2014we felt\nobliged really to sign with them.\nYou're labelled as a skate band. Do you like that label?\nWell, 1 don't like any label, but again,\nthat's one of the things people say about\nus that I'm reasonably happy with. Two\nof us are serious skaters, and the others\nwe're beating into submission.\nNow that you've 'taken off are you\ngoing to get much time for that sort\nof thing?\n/. At the moment it doesn 't seem like it.\nNo, I haven't had a skate for a while,\nexcept for the sound check, I think we\nall do our skating in sound checks now.\nWe'll see. ..I 've got a couple of days next\nweek to go.\nDo you think that your record\ncompany will ask you to stop\nskating?\nNo, I don't think they'll have the nerve\nto say that to us. And we wouldn't stop\nanyway.\nWhat music do you listen to\nyourself?\nLoads of things. Anything, it's all\nammunition to me. The main things\ntend to be hip-hop, stacks of that, loads\nof house\u2014any happening dance music\nI'm interested in\u2014and a lot of American\nguitar bands: Sonic Youth, Pixies you\nknow. But if it's loud and raucous, 1 like\nit. Plenty of things, weird and\nwonderful.\nYou've had a lot of hype, good\nreviews\u2014when do you expect the\nbacklash to start?\nJ think it already has. Whenever you\nhave a lot of people walking around\nshouting 'fes us Jones are the greatest\nband ever' or even 'Jesus f ones are\nmildly good', there's always\nsomeone around who notices and\nwill disagree, sometimes even on\nprinciple, it doesn't really bother\nme.\nYou wear almost stereotypical skate\nclothes, is this a marketing ploy?\nNo, this is how we dressed before the\nband started\u2014in fact the way 1 met the\nkeyboard player was when 1 went to a pub, and saw this person there with a pair of Vision Streetwear shoes on. So\nI looked at these shoes, looked in his face\nand said 'Where do you skate?'...and\nthen we x vent skating and he joined the\nband later on.\nWhat were you doing before the\nband?\nThe kei/board player has a degree in\nLatin. The bass player had a very short-lived college career\u2014I think he did\nhorticulture. I definitely felt I wasn't college or university material. I did 'A' levels, but I loathed them, so 1 got out\nas soon as 1 could.\nWould you say this is 'your band'?\nWell, to an extent, yes. I write all the\nstuff, and it's generally my direction,\nbut I wouldn't pretend that I could do\nit on my own. I do need the rest of them,\nloathe them though 1 do.\nHow did you get the band together?\nThe guitarist was a music paper advert.\nI think we had to take him because he\nwas the only one -who applied, -which is\na bit na ff really\u2014we're still trying to get\nrid of him. The drummer I 've known\nsince school, which is far too long. The\nbass player was a friend of a friend, and\nyou know the keyboard story.\nDo the rest of the band refer to you\nas Jesus?\nYes. No, actually, that's a complete lie.\nBut it sounds good. I think it's a good\nidea, I shall make them do that. It'll be\ngood for me.\nJESUS\nJONES\nPage 10 FELIX May 19 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nHarbouring a grudge?\nDear Editor'\nIt is time for me to stand up for my principles\nand write concerning the behaviour of one of the\nCollege wardens. I have been reluctant to do so\nover the past three months as the warden\nconcerned is a member of the academic staff of\nmy department and as such could have an\ninfluence over my exam results.\nThe warden concerned is Joe Cartwright of\nWillis-Jackson House, Evelyn Gardens. Mr Cartwright was appointed warden at the end of\nthe last academic year when I was Union\nPresident and as a result I was involved in the\ndecision. At the time I was very vocal in supporting Mr Cartwright's appointment. In fact\nyou might say I swayed the panel's decision from\nturning Willis-Jackson House over to the\ndeserving and very capable warden in Holbein\nHouse next door. 1 believed that Mr Cartwright\nwould be a very capable and involved warden,\nthe students would like him and, by the sounds\nof his suggestions for organising events and social\ninteraction, he would be an asset to the residence\nsystem.\nIt is with some embarrassment that I must\napologise to the other members of that panel for\nmisleading them.\nAt one point this year I had the pleasure of\nwandering around Willis-Jackson House. I in it it ally gained access through the main door\nwhich did not shut properly. The sub-warden\ntold me that Joe was in his flat, even though I knew he was in another part of the country. As a matter of fact Mr Cartwright spends most\nweekends in the South Midlands. I was\nreadmitted by the same sub-warden through a door with a missing 'break glass in case of fire'\nlock. The lock was an absolute disgrace. Two of\nthe fire exits were blocked by bikes and a bed.\nThe above is shadowed into insignificance\ncompared with the inconvenience to which he\nput a number of his students over the Easter\nvacation. At Easter the whole of Willis-Jackson\nHouse was .turned over to an outside company\nmeaning that all the students had to move out,\nwhether they were staying in College over the\nvacation or not. Mr Cartwright informed his\nresidents when they found out about the\nsituation that the position had been forced on\nthem by the wardens sub-committee and that he\nwas doing all he could to rectify the position.\nWhy, if this was the case, did I know that W J House was to be turned over to the company in\nJanuary before the wardens sub-committee met?\nWhy do neither the minutes or the\nrepresentatives of that committee remember this\ndecision being made? Why, if this was the case,\ndid wardens make a decision which is specifically\na matter for SRC.\nI believe Mr Cartwright is telling pork ies. Perhaps Mr Cartwright would like to write back\nand correct the following story if he can find fault\nin it.\nFrom what I can tell, Mr Cartwright rang up\nthe Accommodation Office in January as the\nforms were being distributed to his residents\nasking them if they wished to stay in hall over\nEaster. In this telephone conversation he offered\nto hand over his whole house for external renting,\nhence leaving him completely free to fly off to\nSouth Africa at Easter which would inconvenience his students considerably. When\nhis students came to ask their warden for help\nwith their problem he invented a story about the\nwarden's sub-committee to cover his back.\nMr Cartwright's free flat could accommodate\neight students and is hence worth around\n1320,000 to the residence committee. Considering\nthat Mr Cartwright appears to be more trouble\nthan he's worth I suggest the residence\ncommittee now realise that sum of money before\nwe get stuck with a useless warden who lives off\nthe students.\nSydney Harbour-Bridge.,\nInsufferable\nDear Bill,\nDylan James is a classic example of an\ninsufferable, brainwashed adolescent, on a high\nfrom attention seeking and, at present, digging\nhis own grave.\nHis views are typical of a certain brand of\nreligious fanatic who believes that you're damned\nif you're not one of his lot, and takes every\nopportunity to tell vo u about it.\nHe is making a mockery of the Christian faith\nwith his petty bickering about politics and Christianity. Since I'm sceptical about any kind\nof religion anyway, I find his views particularly\namusing. And his all-time classic was actually\nadmitting that he was converted by a US tele-evangelist... has he told his parents?\nAlso most enjoyable is the s lagging that his\ncritics get, 'they're obviously not Christians', he\nsays. By saying that kind of thing it makes me\nwonder if he is a Christian. How does he know\nanyway?\nAnd as for signing off 'yours in Christ', you've\ngot a cheek, Mr James - it's just an umbrella for\nyour ego trip. 'Free will is a central part of\nChristianity, and we should choose to follow\nChrist' you say. May I point out that this\nstatement is two-faced when placed with your\narguments and does not make any sense anyway.\nFree will is part of life, Mr James; tr^s right is not\njust confined to Christianity. Why should we\nchoose Christ anyway? Throughout history\npeople like you have distorted the original ideas\nso much that I wouldn't go near it, but that's my\nopinion and I wouldn't like to offend any\nChristians reading this.\n'Abolish the welfare state' he says. He clearly\ndoes not know what he's talking about and this\nis substantiated by a remark that charities should\nreplace it! Perhaps he should set up a charity so\nthat we can reimburse ourselves for the housing\nbenefits that we are to lose. Would everyone like\nto chip in and pay off my overdraft? Well, how\nabout it? Dig deep Mr James!\nAnd if there are any Christian Socialists out\nthere, Mr James has gallantly laid down a challenge to debate, how courageously open\nminded of him; he won't mind me writing this\nletter.\nI hope you read this Mr James, because you've\ngot a lot to learn about politics, Christianity, life\nand other people's feelings.\nYours Rupert Seldon, Civ Eng 1.\nBigots\nDear Bill,\nWhatever Ole Lie and Bill Bailey, or anyone\nelse, may think of the London School of\nEconomic's Students' Union's decision to elect\nWinston Silcott as their Honorary President\n(FELIX 835), it is no excuse for their bigoted,\nignorant and unthinking letter.\nMany people would agree that 'racism' is a much misused word, but it would not be out of\nplace to describe their letter as out-and-out ra sci st propaganda. They sav 'Black', by which we\nassume they mean Afro-Caribean, people commit\nmore crimes than do whites. This is only true,\nif you also consider how poor and under priv eli ged much of Britain's Afro-Carribean\ncommunity are. Poor people, people who are\ntreated as outsiders or parasites on society, must\nfeel ghetto is ed; and why, as the v must feel,\nshould such people respect laws and rules which\nseem designed to keep them down?\nTheir claim that by arming the police and\nhanging (and boiling) criminals will lead to some\nkind of law-abiding Utopia is patently ridiculous.\nMany people, including many policemen, feel\nthat arming the police would be dangerous.\nHanging is barbaric, condemned b v civilised\npeople all over the world; and, when a mistake\nis made, it is irrevocable.\nLet us not forget that the police and the judicial\nsystem are there to serve the people\u2014not the\nother way around. PC Blakelock died unnecessarily doing his job, but his death was\nas much the fault of the society which produces\nghettos like Broadwater Farm, as the fault of what\nbigots would call the 'murderous Tottenham\nTribesmen'. It is not James Nathan who should\ngrow up, it's all of us.\nYours faithfully,\nMike Hadivin,\nlas on Lander,\nCyril Wong\nPhilip Cribbon.\nWelsh\nDear Bill,\nIn any institution which consists of members\nfrom many nationalities, it be hove s any\npublication purporting to air views, report news\netc within it to rise above the vulgar ridiculing ,\nof any group of people. This is why the 'Dear\nMarge' letter of the last issue was so offensive\nto Welsh people like myself.\nHad such a piece been intended to lampoon a more vociferous section of the College, I suspect\nthat it would never have been considered for\npublication, and rightly so. Broaden your minds\na little, please!\nHowever I exe pct such humour would appeal\nto narrow-minded fascists like Bill Bailey and Co.\nwho were correspondents in your last issue. Their\nletter was full of the twisted logic common to\nextremists and should be treated with the\ncontempt it deserves.\nYours, Geraint Williams.\nPage 2 FELIX May 19 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nA Cry in the\nDark\nThis is a true story.\nIt's a story we all knows om thing about, or think we do. At the very\nleast, everybody has an opinion on\nthe death of Azaria Chamberlain.\nHands up those who think the\ndingo did it.\nThe trouble is, much of what you\nhear, and in this trial everything, is\nfiltered through the press. And that\nmeans di stored. So when Lindy\nChamberlain lost her daughter\nduring a camping trip to Ayers\nRock, the media began a witch hunt\nthat was rapidly supported by the\nAustralian public and much of the\nworld.\nBefore seeing this film I for one\nhad no idea that the accused had\nbeen proved innocent and exonerated, and I suspect there are\na great deal of people in a similar\nframe of mind. But it seems rather\nextravagant that Australia's biggest\never film should be simply an\nattempt to set the record straight\nand highlight the miscarriage of\njustice.\nFrom the opening shots in Mount\nIsa, the Chamberlains are shown as\na stable contente*d family. The dingo\nis shown leaving the tent, and at no\ntime does the film ever suggest there\nis any doubt about Lindy' s innocence. The message is stated\nclearly and firmly.\nAs the story moves from inquest,\nto trial, to imprisonment, the movie\npulls no punches in showing the\nimmoral itv of the tabloids. Notably\nthe press are bored unless there is\nan opportunity for further scandal-mongering. This slant is acceptable\nand necessary->-there are no holds\nbarred in the gutter press.\nThroughout, Meryl Streep's lead\nis both solid and believable, the\noverburdened and unsupported\ndefendant being shown as a human\nbeing. Husband Michael (Sam Neill)\nshows strength then fragility, and\nthough easily outshone by his\nOscar-nominated counterpart, is\nproficient nevertheless. Director\nFred Schepisi leaves a little more to\nbe desired, being somewhat erratic\nand at times jer key. The aerial\nlandscape shots are pleasant, and\nused to good effect.\nA Cry in the Dark is not an\nentertaining movie, and Indiana\nJones III and the new Bond film have\nno worries there. It could be classed\nalongside other scapegoat films li ks The Accused or Scandal. Like those,\nit is something you should go and\nwatch if you have an interest in the\nevents it portrays, not just so you\ncan see Meryl Streep giving birth.\nAndrew Clarke.\nCONTEMPORARY\nDANCE\nMay Ball\nWhereof we cannot speak we\nshould be silent, we were told by\nLudwig Wittgenstein the father of\nmodern philosophy and part-time\nhermetic eccentric. But I don't recall\nany such dicta t forbidding movement in the face of such\nspiritual/ph sy sio logical twitching s or for that matter any argument\nprecluding the making of music. It\nis perhaps in instinctive appreciation\nof this that contemporary dance\nchoreographers continue to discover\nnew ways in which the movements\nof the human 'soul' (for want, as\never, of a better word) can be\ntranslated into movements of the\nhuman form. Where language fails\ndance will often succeed,\noutstripping the boldest aspirations\nof the written word.\nExamples of such success have\nbeen as obvious and as welcome as\nthe 'greenhouse' spring that's been\nbaking the city for these past weeks\nas London hosted some of the most\nexciting new shows from an\ninternational line-up of company's making their British tours.\nThe April in Paris season at The\nPlace launched Revolutionary Tactics\na programme of activities organised\nto focus on French dance\nthroughout this bicentennial\nanniversary of the French\nRevolution. The ten dance\npremieres from the best of the\nFrench scene that were featured\nincluded Le Ballet du Fargistan with\n'Enigmas Miniatures and Other\nVisions'. Featuring parts of limbs\nand heads protruding through\nmobile black frames and other\nd is orientating devices the effect was\nhypnotic and compelling. Neither\nwas the 'funny-bone factor' lost on\nthe less self-conscious of the\naudiences as, in spite of themselves,\nthey collapsed into titters at the sight\nof a half of a head floating across the\nstage or a naked man, haloed with\nflowers, casually reclining. The\nmusic was often equally as strange\nfeaturing a range of sounds from\nclassic French springtime accordion\nmusic to the explosive blast of the\ndidgeridoo (a fantastic instrument\nthat must be heard live) courtesy of\nBritish composer David Coulter.\nAfter two days at The Place the\ncompany moved on to play two\nmore nights to open the May season\nat the Waterman's Arts Centre in\nBrentford but after stopping at\nCardiff and Glasgow have now\nflown back over the channel,\nproving that you need to be quick\noff the mark to catch any single act\non the fast track of contemporary\ndance.\nAs a good place to start then, if\nyou're eager to find the ideal\nrefresher from an excess of\nChekovian chun ner ring here is a brief guide to what's coming for the\nrest of this month as the focus of\nLondon dance shifts to Waterman's Arts Centre\u2014a venue constantly\nbuzzing with film, theatre, dance\nand live music but still maintaining\nFrom the UK Adventures in Motion Pictures\u2014\nwith three exciting pieces including\nKalenda Maia' by choreographer or\n\"Hey DJ! Any chance of some\nKylie Minogue?\"\na relaxed 'family' atmosphere that\nwill not admit of pretence.\nWednesday 24th From Wales\nEarthfall\u2014presenting a lively style\nwhich purports to combine eastern\nmartial arts with western\ncontemporary dance.\nThursday 25th& Friday 26th Le Ballet du Fargistan: Brigitte\nFarges.\nSaturday 27th \u2022\nFrom the UK Shobhan Jeyasingh in\nMiniatures\u2014a highly recommended\neast meets west piece with music by\nMichael Ny man( composer for\nmany Peter Greenaway films\u2014but\ndon't hold that against him).\nMav 19 1989 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nThe Palestinian StoryThe geography of Palestine has been\nredefined by conquest after\nconquest, and each successive\nempire has engraved its mark. You\ncan see the remains of Roman\npillars; Bvzantine and Crusaders\nforts; Saracen palaces and mosques;\nand Christian churches. And surrounding the entire Old City, a Turkish wall built by the Ottomans\nduring their 4(X) year reign.\nWhen Cod sent Abraham out of\nLr to seek the promised land,\nAbraham left what was then\nMesopotamia and is now Iraq. He\ndiscovered the land of Canaan\u2014\ntoday the state of Israel.\nI he boundaries of today's Israel\noutline much the same territory as\nthat settled in by the tribes of Joshua\nafter they seized the land from the\nCanaanites 3,(XX) v ears ago.\nA century ago, vicious antiSemitism was sweeping Russia and\nIu rope. and out of that came a movement to create a Jewish home\nin the ancient land of Zion (which\nmeans 'the hill in Jerusalem'). The\nmovement was called Zionism. It's author, a Hungarian journalist\nnamed Theodre Her/I. Herzl asked\nthe lurks for part ot Palestine and\nShe British for Cyprus. For a time,\nthe British offered to resettle the\nJews in what is now Uganda, but\neven as Herzl s search went on,\nmany Jews were already heading for\nPalestine.\nIn the years that followed, Jewish\nsettlements sprouted up throughout\nthe land. By 1914 there were 100,000\nJews in Palestine. In 1917, the\nBalfour Declaration was approved,\nendorsing a national homeland for\nthe lew s in Palestine.\nPalestinians demonstrated against\nthe Declaration and British support\nlor a Jewish homeland. After all,\nthe v then represented some 90% of\nthe population there. Yet the Balfour\nDeclaration had, in effect, called\nthem intruders\u2014'The existing non-lew ish communities in Palestine'.\nThe Palestinians lived under\nBritish rule for thirty years, from the\nend of the first world war in 1918.\nBv 1920, there were almost forty\nZionist colonies in Palestine. Behind\nthe British military shield, Jewish\nimmigration continued to build. So,\ntoo, did Palestinian frustration, until\nfinally, in 1936, the outrage against\nBritain's one-sided pro-Zionist\npolicy crystallised in the Arabs' first\narmed rebellion. The fighting\nbetween Palestinians and the British\nlasted for three years, from 1936 to\n1939. Faced with the prospect of wounded.\nWorld War II, Britain unleashed its\nfull military power against the\nPalestinians, and smashed their\nrevolt. Some 3,000 Palestinians\ndied: fifteen thousand were\nBritain disbanded all political\norganisations and exiled the political\nleadership. They systematically\ndisarmed the Palestinian population\nand armed the Jewish population.\nThe Biblical Claim to Palestine\nThe original inhabitants ot Palestine were the\nCanaanites, 3,000 years ago. Today's Palestinians claim to be descendants ot the\nCanaanites which, they say, gives them\nhistorical precedence over the Jews who occupy\nthe country.\nBut the Israelis believe that their right to\nPalestine is laid down the book of Genesis.\nAccording to Genisis, God presented Abrham\nwith the land ot the Canaanites;\n',4s an everlasting possession I will give you and\nyour descendants after you the land in which you are\nnow aliens, all the land of Canaan, and I will be God\nto your descendants.\"\nThe Palestinians argue that Palestine has been\nruled by Muslims for several hundred years and\nthat it is a Muslim land. Their argument is\nbacked up by the Quoran;\n\"Abraham was neither a Jew nor yet a Christian; he\nwas full of honour, a Muslim, and not among those\nwho equate partners with God\"\nThe Palestinians, defenseless and\npolitically weak, now had to\ncontend with Jewish determination.\nIn 1947 the United Nations\n'partition' of Palestine gave control\nof 55% of the land to the Jews who\noccupied only 5.5% of the country.\nHundreds of thousands of\nPalestinians were driven from their\nhomes, creating a new generation of\nmisery. The fact that the\nPalestinian's exodus went largely\nunnoticed by the world was further\nproof of the terrible isolation and\npowerlessness these people\nsuffered.\nThe exodus was intensified by the\n1948 massacre in Deir-Yassin, part\nof a deliberate campaign to terror is e the Palestinians. Two hundred and\nfifty were slaughtered; women were\nraped and shot; bodies were\nmutilated and stuffed down wells.\nMany people left their villages\nwithout fighting because they were\nafraid that what happened in DeirYassin was to be repeated.\nAbout one month later, on the\nsame day, British rule officially\nended and Israel became a state.\nBetween 1948 and 1950 Israel\nsystematically destroyed 379 of 475\nvillages. How many were evicted,\nhow many just fled, will never be\nknown.' But over 700,000\nPalestinians have been made\nhomeless finding their way to\nrefugee camps in Jordan, Gaza,\nSyria and Lebanon.\nPeaceful methods having failed,\nthe Palestinian Liberation\nOrganisation (PLO) was formed in\n1948 to draw attention to the plight\nof the Palestinians. P LOgue r ril as launched attacks against Israel and\nother targets, but by 1967 the\nPalestinians had lost control of the\nremaining parts of Palestine.\nThe Israelis continued bulldozing\nand blowing up Palestinian homes.\nAccording to human rights groups,\nan estimated 1,300 houses were\ndynamited in between 1967 and\n1988. Since conquering the West\nBank and Gaza 21 years ago, Israel\nhas deported 1,232 people, some of\nwhom were activists, but many\nwere teachers, doctors, lawyers or\njournalists.\nForty one years ago, it was the\nchildren of Palestine who lost their\nland. Now it's their grand children.\nThree generations without a home.\nThe time has come, they believe, to\nregain their honour and thus\nprovide overall justice to all the\npeople of three major religions.\nMav 19 1989 FELIX Page u "

    "content": "Opinion\nThe Best Class Of Degreed\nI am moved to reply to Sydney Harbour-Bridge's articles in FELIX as they\nhave provoked sadness and disbelief amongst many friends and\ncolleagues. Those who know me well would agree that this move is an\nuncharacteristic step for me to take. But a more representative view must\nbe voiced to redress the balance. Sydney's articles, titled 'IC\u2014A worse\nclass of degree?' argued the case that IC expects its students to work too\nhard. He believes that the typical IC student has little time left to enjoy\na full social life once they have waded through the work expected of them.\nThe articles included colourful examples of his contemporaries who, after\nleaving IC, found 'success' and 'happiness' at different universities or\nin other walks of life. I would like to start my article by giving some case\nhistories of my own which show totally opposite experiences to Sydney\nand his friends. I will also try to explain the reasons why Sydney believes\nIC is such a terrible place.\nToken sad story\nSydney's last article included the\nsad story of 'Chris', an 'enthusiastic\nand socially active character' who is\nsaid to have been screwed up by the\nl( system.\nI have .i close friend who left\nsi hoo l at the same time as me; who\nwas a brilliant mathematician,\nscoring A's and distinctions in the\ntwo maths subjects he took at\nschool. He went to L 'CL, a college\nthat has both arts and science\nfaculties a ratio of women to men\n...depressed,..,drugs\nhigher than Imperial's and which\nhouses a higher proportion of\nstudents in college accommodation\nthan Imperial. His course did not\npush him too hard, but after a term,\nhe became depressed, got heavily\ninvolved in drugs and eventually\ndropped out without taking any\nexams. He never tried to re-enter\nhigher education again.\nWhat does this story prove? It\nproves absolutely nothing. It is a true but colourful case of one\nperson's experience of university.\nJust like Sydney's 'Chris', my friend\nwas not suited to higher education\nbut he was pushed along the path\nwhich is the accepted norm for\nbright students. Few people tried to\nlook at things from his point of\nview. Many said he was needlessly\nwasting his skills. He turned against\nthese people. However, some of us\ndid attempt to understand and\naccept his attitude. We have\nremained firm friends.\nSuccess at Imperial?\nFor want of a worse example, I can\nlist my own experiences at Imperial\nto counter the claim that IC students\nmust endure all work and no play.\nIn mv 3 ' : v ears as an undergraduate\nin the Mechanical Engineering\ndepartment, I have d managed to\nremain an enthusiastic rower (a sport that now takes up between 15\nand 20 hours a week); I have been\nsports editor of FELIX; treasurer of\na society; a regular at parties in the\nUnion; IC representative at our\nprofession's institution; taken part\nand won a national business game;\nled one expedition to Baltistan and\nwill be leading another this summer.\nIf the catalogue of successes reads\ntoo much like a management\nconsultants CV then 1 should also\nsay that I have suffered failures too:\nsome bitterly personal; some\nembarrassingly public. But the\nsupportive environment that I have\nfound at this college, and the\nliterally infinite variety of\nopportunities available at IC have\nhelped me bounce back.\nYou don't need to be mega\nintelligent to enjoy the opportunities\navailable here and still get through\nthe academic course. I managed\nmediocre 2:2's in my first two v ears,\\ ct 1 have recently been offered an\nexcellent job, even though I was up\nagainst the most able Oxbridge\ncandidates. Mv interviewers made\nit clear how highly they valued a degree from IC.\nhave tried to strike a balance\nbetween work and play that\nrespects the academic needs of my\ncourse but still allows me the\nfreedom to participate in what I want, when I want. I was once\naccused of being selfish because of\nEmbarrassingly public\nfailures\nthis attitude. Selfish is an emotive\nword that implies unfairness to\nothers in the pursuit of your own goals. I would prefer to describe my\nattitude as opportunist: taking\nopportunities as the v come, even\nr eating them, but never at the cost\nof hurting someone else.\nDoes mv case disprove those that\nSydney used to discredit IC? No, not as an isolated example. But I know mv experiences are not\nunique. Many friends and colle ages have thoroughly enjoyed their time\nhere at IC because they have struck\ntheir own balances between work\nand play. Once we are in steady\njobs, we won't be able to get\ninvolved in so many wild and wacky\nthings. We may as well make the\nmost of those opportunities now\nSee both sides\nHaving read this far, you could be\nforgiven for thinking that I believe\nIC is perfect (or that I am being paid\nto write this). I don't( and I'm not)\nBut 1 do refuse to adopt Sydney's total negative attitude that if\nsomething is wrong, everything\nmust be wrong. This negativity is\nendemic in our tabloid society\nwhere everything must be\nexpressed in black and white; where\nno one attempts to understand\nanother's point of view. We are\nbecoming more and more polarised\nby Dominic Strowbridge\nHow many of us are all to eager to\nwrite a letter of complaint to the\nBank manager, or our Union\nPresident? But how many would\nwrite to sav thank you, or well\ndone' Fewer 1 would expect.\nOur opposing opinions\nWhy should Sydney and I hold such\ndifferent views of life at 1C?I do not\nknow Sydney personally but can\nidentify two influences that may\ngive us these opposing opinions.\nA major influence on Sydney\ncould be his experiences as ICU\nPresident last year. The hostile role\nthat he chose to adopt was\nunderstandable to defend himself\nfrom the constant barrage of\nbickering he had to endure in that\nrole. This must have taken its toll\nand left some bitterness. I personally will avoid confrontation\nwhere ever possible: an attitude\nusually mistaken as an easy way\nout, whereas in practice it often\nrequires a high level oi tolerance and\nunderstanding.\nThe other influence stems from\nthe different environments in which\nwe study. 1 have been fortunate\nenough to take mv degree in a department that has consistently\nbeen judged outstanding in the last\nfew years. Sydney's department\nwas recently condemned by the\nUGC as second rate. Our environments, at opposite ends of\na spectrum, will obviously give us\ndifferent attitudes towards our\nlecturers and the work we do for\nthem.\nThere will be many other\ninfluences on our points of view but\nthese may prove the most\nsignificant. Do they prove that 1 am\nMW and wacky\nright or that Sydney is wrong? No. Sydney is not totally wrong in what\nhe says. He has simply put forward\nhis blinkered and unbalanced view,\nwithout considering the issue in full.\nHis central argument against IC was\nthat our tutors expect us to work too\nhard.\nLecturers at fault too\nI believe Sydney has been led into\nmaking this statement because both\nhe and the lecturers often fail to\nappreciate each other's point of\nview.\nMost lecturers and academics are\npeople who dedicate their lives to\nthe pursuit of knowledge. Their\nvalues are based upon respect for\nlearning and the acquisition of\nknowledge. Most students at IC,\nwith the exception of the minority\nwho wish to progress to an\nacademic life, have a different value\nsystem. They base their value\nsystem upon a more industrial\nculture, where status is associated\nwith progression up the managerial\nladder. Too many lecturers fail to\nappreciate that their students are\nnot devoted to the pursuit of\nexcellence but are here, as a means\nto an end, to gain a degree. And many students fail to respect the\nvalues of their tutors.\nNo philosophy\nIt would be arrogant to finish this\narticle with some guiding philosophy on how to make the\nmost of IC. Everyone is different\nand adapts to a situation in a different way. What has proved\nsuccessful for me could prove\ndisastrous for another. What should\nbecome clear, however, is that\nwhatever direction you choose, you\nwill only get out.of life as much as\nvo u put in.\nThere is a lot of work to do at IC,\nespecially now, with the exams\nlooming up. Good luck and I hope\nyou have a good time too!\nMay 19 1989 FELIX Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nEditorial\nSnack bar The Union's decision this week to reduce the portion size in the snack bar still further is typical of the warped money grabbing attitude which the\nUnion administration has adopted throughout the year.\nIt is outrageous that the Union should consider profit margins more\nimportant than providing students with a reasonable quantity of food at\na reasonable price.\nNow it is no longer possible to buy a meal in the snack bar and eat it\nwithout feeling hungry afterwards. No wonder the staff are embarrassed\nabout having to serve the new slim-line portions.\nThe Union Deputy President's argument, that the snack bar has been\nmaking a loss because portions have been too large, is typical of the\ntwisted logic of a man so engulfed in red tape that he has disappeared\ninto his own bureaucratic back passage.\nIt does not take much intelligence to realise that the real reason the\nsnack bar is not making a profit is because it has lost most of its customers.\nJust compare the massive queues of last year with the empty tables of\nthis year. Ask yourself why the Union bought two tills at the start of the\nyear to cope with the expected demand and now finds it can easily manage\nwith only one? \u2022\nStudents do not eat in the snack bar because it is not good value for\nmoney. Despite the good quality of the food, they need filling meals at\na reasonable price. Customers will not spend money on a meal which will\nleave them feeling hungry afterwards.\nThe financial problems of the snack bar will solve themselves when\nstudents perceive the snack bar to be good value for money. When this\nhappens students will start eating at the snack bar as regularly as they\nhave done in the past.\nIndustrial Relations Committee Rupert Clayton deserves a pat on the back for organising an advertising\ngathering campaign for the Union publications. Hopefully, the 1,400 letters\n/which are about to be sent off will bring in a significant quantity of revenue\nwhich will enable the standards of the publications to be improved.\nFELIX Next week's FELIX will be produced by Union President Nigel Baker.\nCredits Oodles of thanks to: Stef, the news team: Adam Harrington, Liz Warren\nand Nick Merriam; Jason Lander, Doug King for the Rag feature, Andy\nGarside, Artdy Clarke and Sumit Guha, Steve Meyfroidt and Susan Appleby\nfor the music page, Sez Wilkinson, Rose, Dean, Eric, special thanks to\nLiz, Jason, Mike and Stef for staying up until 4am collating last week,\nthe guy from films oc, this week's colla tors and everyone I have forgotten.\nStaff meeting today 1.30pm.

    "content": "\u2022 cR OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nAUT ready to\naccept pay offer\nUniversity vice-chancellors and the\nAssociation of University Teachers\n(ALT) representatives have agreed\na possible settlement to their five\nmonth old pay dispute which\nthreatens 70,000 degrees. It took\nnearly seven hours on Tuesday to\nreach a decision on the new proposals put forward by Sir Pat\nLowrv, independent negotiator and\nchairman of the talks.\nAccording to the new deal, all\nacademic staff will receive a six per\ncent pay increase from April 1 and\na lump sum of \u00a3150. This may be\nincreased to \u00a3285 at the discretion\nof the universities, equivalent tc\nbackdating the offer to January 1.\nThere will also be a merit award of\none per cent in October to reward\nhigh performance and to attract\napplications to short-staffed areas.\nDespite reservations the AUT have recommended this offer to\ntheir members. Diana Warwick,\ngeneral secretary of the AUT, said\nthat this was not a fair deal but the\nbest they could do in the circumstances.\nThere were varying opinions in\nthe AUT executive itself. Some\nmembers wanted to hold out for the\noriginal claim of six per cent from\nMarch I, backdated to January 1.\nThe terms of the settlement are\nbeing examined by the AUT council\nmeetings on Thursday, Friday and\nSaturday and a ballot will be held\nif it is felt necessary.\nDr Susan Parry, speaking on\nbehalf of the AUT at Imperial\nCollege, said that they were less\nthan happy with the 'extremely\nsmall' offer. She mentioned in\nparticular that some members\nwould be very unhappy that the\noffer was not backdated to 1988. She\nexpressed concern about the\ndiscretionary use of the one per cent\nmerit rises in October and said that\nthey would prefer it to be 'across the\nboard'.\nDr Parry said that the University\nGrants Committee funding was\nbetter at IC than at most other\nuniversities and added that she\nhoped the Rector, Professor Eric\nAsh would offer a lump sum greater\nthan \u00a3150.\nProfessor Ash told FELIX that the\nCollege would be as generous as it\npossibly could, indicating that he\nwas limited by the amount of money\navailable. He said that he would\nprefer to act in accord with other\nLondon colleges, which might limit\nhis offer further. He added that he\nwas looking forward to the end of\nthe action and hoped the AUT would ratify the proposals at their\ncouncil meeting.\nTension over the dispute has been\nrising recently. On Monday the\nlecturers' leaders won a High Court\ninjunction to prevent the sacking of\n600 lecturers who had refused to\nmark examination papers at the\nUniversity of Wales College at\nCardiff. The students at Cardiff are\nsupporting their lecturers, having\naccused the college of doing nothing\nto resolve the conflict. Lecturers at\nSwansea had been warned that their\npay would be stopped if the v also\nrefused to mark papers.\nDisaster\nstrikes!\nThe production of FELIX was\ndelayed this week due to the failure\nof the Print Unit's offset litho\nprinting machine. The machine\nbroke down on Thursday morning,\ntwo days after its regular service,\nwhen a critical component sheared.\nFELIX Editor, Bill Goodwin said that\nhe was unsure when the paper\nwould appear and described the\nincident as 'bloody typical.'\nMUD, MUD, GLORIOUS MUD\na 'Fearsome' Fiona Nicholas and Ralph 'Grapple' Greenwell wrestle at the Rag Fete\nNo books for St Mary's Academics at St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School are angry at the\nSchool's decision to convert one of\nits libraries into a locker and work\nroom for BSc students.\nThev are worried that the closure\nof the Wright Flemming Institute\nlibrary, which holds 1000 journals\non microbiology and immunology\nwill make it much more difficult for\nacademics to access the texts they\nneed.\nAlthough the journals will be\nrehoused in the School's main\nlibrary, an equivalent number of\njournals will have to be put into the\nlibrary depository in E^ ham because\nof a shortage of space.\nHead of the immunology Department, Professor Brent told\nFELIX that the library's conversion\nwas 'of no benefit whatsoever' and\nsaid that the removal of journals to\nEgham would mean the loss of a significant academic resource'.\nThe lack of space is so acute that\nSt Marys will be unable to bid for\nmedical books from the Senate\nHouse collection when it becomes\nan arts only library in 1990. There\nare also fears that the intake of\nperiodicals \u2014 500 of which have to\nbe discarded each v ear to make\nroom new titles \u2014 will have to be cut\nback.\n'We've been given extra mon ev to\nb uv periodicals in new areas but we\nare not sure where to put them' said\nSenior Assistant Librarian Sammy\nSmith.\nThe library's application to St\nMary's accommodation Committee\nfor 400 square feet of basement\nspace, sufficient to store 8000\njournals in high density shelving,\nwas turned down in June last v ear.

    "content": "News\nPoll Tax\nThe College has completed Poll Tax\nregistration forms on behalf of\nWestminster Council for those\nstudents living in Princes Gardens,\nMontpelier Hall and Beit Quad.\nStudents will be registered at their\nterm time address and will be\nexpected to pay the Council directly\nwhen Poll Tax is introduced in Apri\nI WO\nNUS lobby\nThe NUS has organised a lobby of\nParliament on May25 against\nstudent loans. The march is for the\nbenefit of 'black students, women,\ndisabled and mature students', who\naccording to the NUS would be\nmost disadvantaged by a loans\nscheme.\nGraduate pay\nA report in Tuesday's Educational\nGuardian shows that graduate\nearnings have been shown to\nincrease in the last six years.\nThe lowest rises have been in teaching, nursing and social work.\n1980 graduates in these professions\nearned an average of \u00a39,000 in 1987,\nonly \u00a31,000 more than 1986 starting\nsalaries.\nThis is in stark contrast to earnings\nfor graduates who took jobs in the\nfinancial sector, where average\ngross salaries exceeded \u00a320,000 in\n1987. Mechanical Engineers\ncommanded above average\ngraduate salaries in the same period,\nat around \u00a313,000.\nNew Dean\nProfessor IS Archer will become the\nnew Dean of the Royal School of\nMines for the year beginning\nSeptember 1 1989.\nICBC wins\nImperial College Boat Club won a number of races over the v.ee k end. The Senior first cox less crew of four\nand the senior thirds crew of eight\ncame first in 1500m races at the\nPutney Town regatta on Saturday.\nThe senior first crew of four also\nmanaged to win a1750m race at\nSunday's Metropolitan regatta in the Royal Docks along with the\nsenior seconds team of eight. The\nsenior thirds cox ed four lost at the\nmeeting breaking their run of 13\nconsecutive wins. Boat Club Captain\nSteve Pearson commented ' Our performance shows great promise\nfor the Thames Cup at the Henley\nRoyal Regatta.'\nIs the Union trying to starve us?\nStaff in the Union snack bar say they\nare 'really embarrassed' at having to\nserve reduced portions following a clamp down on Wednesday.\nThe decision to reduce portion\nsize was taken by snack bar manager, Ian Richards, in the wake\nof large losses in recent months and\nan v staff caught giving over large\nportions will be forced to pay for\nthem themselves.\nMr Richards told FELIX that the\nportions the snack bar had been\nserving were larger than those\nbudgeted for when deciding the\nsnack bars pricing policy, which\nprovides an average markup of 60%\non food items.\nAccording to the most recent\nfigures, the snack bar made a loss of\nL949 in February and \u00a32171 in December. This compares with a profit of \u00a31505 in October.\nSome of the losses are thought to\nhave been the result of thefts from\nthe snack bar's store room before\nEaster. About \u00a3100 of vending\nI* This portion of salad cost 40p from the Union snack bar. supplies are believed to have been and has changed the store room\nS \u00b0 u3n',,,., locks and, according to the snack bar\nThe snack bar has since introduced manager, there have been no\na bin card system for stock control further thefts.\nNew FELIX Editor: Goodwin\nand Baker to exchange jobs\nThe Minister of State for Education,\nThe Right Honourable Kenneth\nBaker, and FELIX Editor Bill\nGoodwin are to swap places for a week starting next Monday in order\nto highlight the difficulties in each\nothers' jobs.\n'It's going to be fascinating', said\nKenneth Baker who plans to\nproduce a newspaper using his\ntalents in chemical engineering and\npoet rv. He is hoping to bring to the\nposition his experience as an\nartillery- instructor to the Libvan\nMr Baker said that he would\nchange the format of FELIX and\ndelegate sections of the paper to\neditorially autonomous members of\nstaff. 'The Minister of Education's workload is a bit amorphous, and\nBill will find it easy to do nothing for\n,i week', he added.\nBill Goodwin said that he did not\nexpect to achieve much with only\none week in office. He hopes to use\nthe experience to prepare a report\non the workings of the Ministry.\nBoth expect to make several slip-ups during the week and it will be\ninteresting to see the outcome.\nCollege Secretary redefined\nThe job of the College Secretary will\nbe redefined after the retirement of\nthe current Secretary John Smith.\nHis Successor will be appointed to\nthe post of Managing Director\n(Property and Finance).\nThe Rector, Eric Ash, commented\nthat the ti tile 'College Secretary was\narchaic' and that the new title was\nchosen to reflect the overall\nmanagerial responsibility of the\npost.\nThe Rector also said that there\nwould be no great changes as far as\nthe College was concerned, but that\nthe new post would concentrate on\nestates and finance. The rector told\nFELIX he felt the future of the\nCollege depended on the correct\nhandling of assets such as Silwood\nI 'ark.\nThe appointment is being handled\nthrough an agency rather than the\nPersonnel Department as the\nCollege felt that the agency would\nbe better able at head hunting a suitable candidate'. A special rate\nlias been negotiated with the agency\nthrough an alumnus of the College\nwho serves on the College Alumnus\nBoard.\nJohn Smith is believed to be\nunhappy at the manner in which his\nsuccessor is being recruited.\nColoured\nstudents\nThere were blue, green and orange\nfaces all around on Saturday when\nstudent pranksters added food\ncolouring ' I the water tanks in Fisher Hall.\nSixty bottles of food colouring\nwere discovered in the tanks after\nresidents complained that they had\nchanged colour during their\nmorning showers.\nWorkmen were called in to drain\nand flush the tanks in houses 12,18,\n20, 22, 26 and 28. Water to the hall,\nwhich contains the Evelyn Gardens\nlaundry, was cut off for a day whilst\nthe repairs were being made.\nEvelyn Gardens Residence\nSuperintendent Peter Leeson\ndescribed the incident as 'a silly\nprank which had got out of hand' and said that it had cost the College\na lot of money.\nFisher Hall warden, Dr Richard\nMurphy told FELIX that he would\nbe writing to residents of the hall\nasking for information and calling\nhe culprits to come forward.\nIN BRIEF\nA spokesman from the Royal\nCollege of Science Union has\nconfirmed that their 'Ten Tors' walk\nprobably occured last weekend. He\nadded that the event probably took\nplace in Dartmoor but said that he\ncouldn't remember why RCS had\ndecided to embark on the walk.\nMay 19 1989\nFELIX\nPage 3\n\n"

FELIX staff get their\nA revenge on Goodwin.\nThe v ear started with the traditional\ntid d lev winking down Oxford Street,\nwhich made \u00a32,500 for Action Aid.A week after that was the Men Cap collection which raised \u00a3730 (a jolly\ngood show by all who went).\nAfter that came that bundle of fun\nand jolly good japes, Rag Week\nwhich started as usual with the RCS\nBeer Festival, at which even though\nslightly fewer people turned up than\nlast year, those who did managed\nto drink more (we're obviously\ngetting the marketing right). Guilds\nCarnival was a storming do with an\neven more storming \u00a3600 being\nmade.\nAside from the balls-up with\nIndSoc, Rag Week went reasonably\n(and if anyone doesn't go through\nthe standard procedure when booking rooms during next Rag\nWeek they'll have their gonads\nripped off and mailed to their\ngrandmothers).\nThe on lv thing Rag Week was\nmissing was a big sponsored event\nas the piano marathon was\nconsigned to its rightful grave.

For\nall those still with us next year, Rag\nWeek is the 8th to 18th of November\n(so get your filo faxes out).\nThis year, the CC U's( namely\nRCS) have done a lot of collecting\non their own initiative, leading to\nthe question of what exactly is the\ndefinition of IC Rag, as we have a set-up that is virtually unique in the\ncountry. Rag Raids have varied in\nsuccess. Monopoly made \u00a3800 for\nBIBIC, going into everything else\nlike casinos and bar quiz es etc\nwould take too long.
