    "content": "What' s On\nSome Honest Guff!\nRe: Mr Pinnegar's motion of No Confidence in the\nEditor of FELIX.\nSome concern has been expressed over my\nway of producing FELIX. While it is true that\nFELIX is the \"Newspaper of Imperial College\nUnion\", I will be the first to admit that I exert a very strong personal influence over it. FELIX is\nproduced by a small group of individuals. I discuss\nmy ideas with them \u2014 they act as a restraining\nfactor on my strong desire to tear this bloody\nincapable Union to fragments (Ooops!). It is\nalways wise to get second, third and fourth\nopinions on any contentious material to be\nprinted in FELIX, but in the end. I am responsible.\nI can only produce the kind of FELIX I think I would like to read if I were a student. I think I have\nperformed that task admirably. BUT, what do\nother students feel? If I felt that FELIX was not\nreaching its readers, I would resign now. While I concede it cannot satisfy everyone, I think the\nmajority of students enjoy reading the kind of\nFELIX I enjoy producing. It is interesting to note\nthat only those who do not will write to inform me\nso.\nIt is important to remember that the only\nconnection that the \"average student\" (what does\nthat mean?) has with the Union is via FELIX. It is\ntherefore essential that FELIX enjoys press\nfreedom. Every student should feel that he can\nhave his views aired in FELIX and that is why I encourage such an active letters page. I have\nused my editorial to criticise the Union, with\nspecial reference to our President, John Passmore. Mr Passmore has not used our much\ncherished \"right of reply\" to defend his position;\nfrom this you must draw your own conclusions.\n(I should not restrict my condemnation to the\nExec \u2014 what about the \"average student'? He\ntoo is a fully paid-up member of the Union and\nshould not sit back and allow the Union to\ndisintegrate through poor leadership. Is there\nanyone out there?)\nDoes Mr Pinnegar want an Editor of FELIX\nsuch as John Passmore? Does he want me to\n\"Hush mah mouth\"? Does he really feel that the\nstudents of IC are so impressionable? Or would\nhe rather that I used my position as Editor to\nprovoke (is this the right word? \u2014 I think so!)\ndiscussion within this stagnant pond of bored and\nboring individuals. I'm no cynic, but when I look at\nthe pathetic Union that used to be so lively when\nit had some actual characters in charge of it, I sincerely feel that we need to confront our plastic\nPresident and Executive and shout: \"For God's sake, GO!\" This Ultra Vires Business\nDuring the discussion of the El Salvador motion at\nthe Hustings U GM it was pointed out that one\nsection of the motion asked for ICU to affiliate to\nthe campaign. It was stated that in view of recent\ndevelopments concerning the C ND affiliation fee,\nthis action would be Ultra Vires the Constitution.\n(Incidentally, \"Ultra Vires\" is merely a succinct\nway of saying \"outside the powers of\".)\nImmediately, Mr Passmore agreed and said\nthat this section would be deleted. Owen Greene\ndisagreed most strongly to this action, and he was\nright to do so. A trend that is annoying me more\nand more in this \"slightly right of centre\" College\nis to dismiss left-wingers such as Mr Greeneasbeing\nout of order. Being slightly right of centre myself, I disagree with many of Mr Greene's views, but I find myself agreeing with him here on this point of\nprinciple, not ideology. It is only Ultra Vires to pay\nsuch an affiliation fee from \"trust money\" such as\nUnion money. BUT it is quite legal to raise the\nmoney by organising collections (such as WU S collections) to pay the fee. AND it should be the\nExec's job to investigate all of these methods and\norganise a collection at the U GM \u2014 after all, if a majority vote to affiliate, then surely these people\nare morally bound to contribute to such a fund.\nIt angers me as much as it does Mr Greene that\nJohn Passmore should ALWAYS opt for the easy\nway out, and what suits his own personal politics.\nHe has got his little letter from the Union\nSolicitors stating the Ultra Vires position and he\nclings to it like a limpet. He is quite aware that\ncollections tor affiliation lees are not Ultra Vires.\nAnything for the easy life, eh John?\nCongratulations To the four new sabbaticals elected for next year.\nCommiserations to the losers.\nIt's interesting to see that they are all RCS men.\nPerhaps this says something about the highly\nvocational nature of courses in Guilds and Mines.\nI'm sure that next year's Exec will function as a team \u2014 they all know each other and seem to get\non well. Might be a good year. One thing though,\nwhat is this Twenty-Two Club they all appear to\nbelong to? \u2014 1 can't find it in the Union Handbook\nanywhere.\nEaster Issue\nNext week, 1 will be attempting to bring out FELIX\non Thursday. This will be the bumper special\nEaster issue. As with the Christmas issue, I hope to\nhave a Scaramouche extravaganza, and maybe a few other treats. All copy should be submitted by\nSunday lunchtime. I can't guarantee anything\nsubmitted after that going in.\nHandbook & Freshers' FELIX\nPaul Donovan, Handbook Editor, wants your\narticles now.\nI would like to point out that it's no use thinking\nthat if you don't have an article in the Handbook,\nthat you can make up for your laziness by having\none in the Freshers' FELIX \u2014 'f raid that's just not\non! I 've had a word with next year's Editor, Mark\nSmith, who tells me he will only be accepting\narticles which detail a Club's activities in the first\nfew weeks of term from those clubs kind enough to\nsubmit to the Handbook.\nThanks to\nColin, Mark, Patrick, Steve, Phil, Caroline, Martin,\nDave, Paul, Zar, Ian and Maz.\nIncidentally, I simply LOVE SF Sock articles to\nbe entertaining and may I say that 1 a/u; a ys find\nthem so. Kenneth Mann, a man so talented and\ndedicated to entertaining the masses through\nFELIX that he couldn't spare five minutes of his\ntime to do so in this year's Phoenix magazine\ndeserves the admiration of us all. I hope the\nPhoenix (out next term) does not suffer adversely\nfrom this sad, sad omission of creative excellence.\nHard luck to those Chelsea people who tried to\nkidnap Rae Snee this week. I guess that's just\ntough t it ties. Finally, Happy Birthday Scaramouche!\nThis week's puzzle is on page 8.\nI think Steve Marshall is gradually taking over\nthe back page.

    "content": "Letters\nto the\nEditor\nDear Mr Marshall\nI was pleased with the compromise reached at the U GM between a majority of opinion\nand achieving your resignation.\nThe latter would have caused\nupheaval and extra burden on\nthe other Union officers which\nalso would not have been to the\nbenefit of the Union.\nHowever, may I ask that you\nshow kindness, toleration and\nconsideration to others. The following is the reason for my\nrecent attitudes:\n' We are all influenced by everybody around us. Especially\nby the media. From reading this\nyear's FELIX, it is easy to gain\nthe impression that Mr Marshall's attempts at handling various ideas and people are normal human behaviour. In the years to\ncome, if he is to continue and set\nthe precedent for future editors,\nwe are all liable to be nastier\npeople as a result. Is any employer then going to take on\nanybody from IC? Or, will we be\nnasty employers?\nI realise that my above argument is subjective and not easy to\nprove, but I fear that it may\ncontain truth.\nI would hope that this issue\nneed never be raised again.\nTours faithfully\nDavid Pinnegar\nDear Sir (Stevie baby mate)\nJust a quick word about the\nself-styled nut cases who are at\npresent trying to get rid of you on\na motion in the next U GM, which if this letter is published\nwill have already occurred. As\nyou probably realise I mean that\nPinnegar fellow, the little runt.\nAny normal person with a small\nenough sense of humour could\nsee that your editorials along the\nlines of two weeks' ago are not\nexactly to be taken 100% seriously!\nWhich is presumably Pinnegar\nand his smelly little friend could\nnot see this. I have talked to a number of people in the physics\ndepartment of pin beggar is a member, and the general feeling\nout of about 160 people is that\nthis little med lo maniac gets all he\nhas coming to him in the form of\nletters like this and promised\nmuggings. (No, that has absolutely nothing to do with me).\nO KOK, so 48 people did sign\nthe letter with him that appeared\nin last week's FELIX. But my\ninvestigations lend to suggest\nthat not all those signatures were\nactually backed up by the people\nto whom they were supposed to\nbelong. No of course I'm not\nsuggesting the letter was forged,\nbut just that some of the people\non it have perhaps in some way\nbeen misrepresented.\nAlso, Steve, there was a vicious\nrumour going round that pin\nsucker just wanted to get onto IC Radio or something.\nTours against self-styled gad a ff is Eric the Mutilated Camel C Hatton, DoC Research Group\nDear Sir\nAs author of the article entitled\n\" Study in the Shadow of the\nGun\"( FELIX578) I should like\nto add one or two further points.\nThe purpose of the article was\nto give advance notice of a talk\nby two Palestinian students from\na university on the Israel ioc cup pied West Bank about alleged interference by the\noccupying authorities. The article also served as a back-ground to the talk and the\nunderlying Middle East conflict.\nThe Middle East problem is both\nold and very complex and hence\nto do any justice to the subject\nthe article necessarily had to be\nlong.\nI do not claim for a moment\nthat the history of Palestine and\nIsrael given in the article is a completely objective account, but I cannot accept Mess rs Cooper and Axelrod's statement\nin a letter in last week's issue\n( FELIX579) that Bir Zeit\" enjoys complete academic freedom\". This is quite untrue.\nMost universities in the world\nencourage freedom of thought\nand expression, and as soon as an\noutside influence curtails that\nfreedom, the university's very\nexistence is threatened. Bir Zeit's existence is being threatened by\nthe military authorities as\nreported by the student at the\ntalk. This is certainly not\ncreating peace, and since the\npurpose of the UN is to create\nand maintain peace and justice\nin the world this offensive is not\nbeing taken lightly.\nTours faithfully\nNick Bedding\nUN Soc\nDear Sir\nI find it scandalous that a famous author should be visiting\nIC without massive publicity.\nThe Bookshop hasn't got any ol\nhis books in, he's not appearing\nin the Read or Pippard Lecture\nTheatres (not famous enough say\nCollege authorities), and yet this\nis the man described by Tom Disch as \" one of the science\nfiction field's top bananas\". I don't know what Mr Disch meant, but in any case JOHN SLADE K's visit is an event\nwhich deserves to be more well\nknown. If FELIX doesn't send a reporter along to Physics Lecture\nTheatre 2 on Tuesday March17 at 1:30pm, I would like to know\nthe reason why.\nTours frantically public ising KC Mann( Miss)\nDear Sir\nI would like to reply to your\njournalist's( sic) article( sic)\nabout the Labour Club's meeting\nwith Chris Price (Labour MP for\nLewisham).\nWhatever Zarathustra's opinion of the meeting, it was clearly\nserious and did not warrant such\na juvenile report.\nFurthermore, it may be of\nsome interest to those people who\nhave been to comprehensive schools to know that the remarks\n\"simian morons\" was addressed\nto them and not to Chris Price. In\naddition, the phrase, \"addled\nbrained baboon\", was not used\nand Zarathustra was merely quiet e ned and not evicted.\nAn accurate account of the\nmeeting would have been as\nfollows: Chris Price talked about\nthree main areas of policy, namely housing, health and education. He concentrated on\narguments against the present\ngovernment's policy of privatisation in these areas.\nHe took great pains to explain\nthat he was not opposed to home\nownership as such (stating that\n\"most Labour MPs own their\nown houses\"), except where it\ninterfered with housing provision\nfor large numbers of people. Such\na case is council housing, the\nmoney coming in from rents\nprovides the finances for the next\ngeneration of houses and although\nhouseholders will pay more money during a lifetime of\npaying rent that the amount needed to buy theirs, this is\nabsolutely necessary at a time\nwhen private sector housing is\nalmost at a standstill and in London alone approximately30,000 people are forced to squat\nshort life property.\nHe then went on to criticise\nprivate medicine and in particular pay beds in NHS hospitals.\nIt is not at all certain that pay\nbeds bring substantial amounts of\nmoney to the NHS, but it is clear\nthat private patients leave themselves wide open to corrupt\npractices. Apart from the money\nthey pay to the Area Health\nAuthority, private patients also\npay a fee directly to the con-sultan t, based on what treatment\nis given. This obviously gives an\nunnecessary incentive to consultants to give expensive unneeded\noperations.\nFinally, he launched into private schools, criticising the\ncharitable status that public schools enjoy, and the resulting\nsub sid is ation of the wealthy by\nthe poor. A small example of this\nis the way in which over the last\nsix years Eton College (at present\nhaving the exclusive lee of\n\u00a3 3 , 5 0 0 pa) has been receiving butter through a charitable EEC scheme at 32pa pound saving the\nCollege an estimated \u00a310,000 a year.\nTours fraternally\nB Alexander and D Gun a warden a for Labour Club Dear Sir\nLast week's FELIX contained\nan article which degraded and\nhumi late d the IC Labour Club's Chris Price meeting.\nIt is deplorable that any club\nor society within Imperial College should suffer such an\nunwarranted attack in the Union newspaper, especially outside the\neditorial or letters section.\nNo doubt it provided a good\ngiggle for some childish Tories at\nIC but I believe the sensible\nmajority of students here would\nagree that the small, but enthusiastic, Labour Club is a coward's target for blind right-wing abuse.\nI hope the writer responsible for\nthe report will apologize (mat-u rely) to the Labour Club in this\nweeks FELIX. Tours faithfully\nA. M.K ell cr man Ci vEng1 Ed's. Vote\n(I find it very difficult to defend\nour (new) reporter's actions. So I won'tI trust that he will do the\ndecent thing.)\nSir\nThese are just some personal\nopinions on the Hustings U GM and the candidates involved.\nWhy were contentious political\nissues such a central point in the\nelection speeches of the candidates claiming to be a political? I make a special reference to South\nAfrica. The candidates who were\nperhaps more 'political' (although\nthis term is generally used to\ndiscredit people with left-wing\nviews) took the trouble to stress\nthe importance of student issues\nand their impartiality to political\naffairs only to have apartheid\nand other essentially irrelevant*\nissues dragged up by candidates\nContinued on page 4\nPage 2 FELIX, March 13,1981\n\n"

    "content": "Don't Let WELLSOC die!!!!!!!!!!!\nIf anyone knows anything about the H.G. Wells Society, or\nwould like to take it over and run it, could they please contact\nIan Hanley (SCC Chairman) via the Union Office or Steve\nMarshall who would be willing to lend a hand,but would not\nhave time to run it (unfortunately).\nOtherwise, it will be abolished - a shame for one of the most\nsuccessful societies of latter years.\nIC Football\nFifths win ULU\nLower Reserve\nCup Final\nIC V v LSE IV\n1 \u2014 0\nTHE previous Saturday had seen ICV beat\nQM CIV by four goals to two and hence confirm them as champions of league SR.\nOn Saturday, March 7, ICV played against\nLSE IV in the final of the lower Reserve Cup.\nOn the way to the final IC had beaten QM C IV, Charing Cross II, Goldsmith's III and St\nThomas II, while in their semi-final LSE had\nbeaten IC VI, but could they beat the vastly\nsuperior IC V? Conditions were not ideal for good football\nwith the ground being very heavy. IC started\nconfidently with Archer, Kelly and Hardy\ncontrolling midfield but the forwards Healy,\nBurns and Dhillon created few chances as\nthey came up against a solid LSE defence.\nWhen LSE did attack they had the help of the\nreferee and one of the linesman, but the\nst rok ng tackling of fullback sAud in and\nGohil, the controlling influence of centre back Hatton and the sweeping of Cable left the\nkeeper Brown with very little to do (thank\ngoodness!). About half way through the first\nhalf Archer saw his volley well and truly beat\nthe LSE keeper only to hit the bar and go out\nof play. Suddenly IC found belief in\nthemselves, a ball by Kelly found Healy on the\nedge of the LSE box, his shot was only\nparried by the keeper and Dhillon running in,\nknocked the ball back to Burns who buried\nthe ball in the net and IC were one up. It\nshould have been two when minutes later\nHealy weaved his way passed three defenders\nand with only the keeper to beat passed the\nball to Hardy whose shot was cleared off the\nline.\nAt half-time the score was still one-nil, the\nrefreshments consisting of luke-warm weak\ninstant tea.\nIn the second half LSE pushed more men\nforward in a vain attempt to get the equalise r but IC had other ideas. Midfield never\nstopped running, Gohil tackled as if his life\nwas at stake, Audin \"dealt\" with the winger\nadmirably, Hatton won everything in the air\nand Cable stamped out what attack was left.\nThis led to an LSE player going to hospital for\nstitches and LSE were again reduced to ten\nmen a few minutes later when Healy mistimed\none of his rare tackles. Brown made the box\nhis own and stopped everything that was\nthrown at him. Towards the end LSE began to\ntire, Audin overlapped twice down the right\nonly to see the forwards squander chances,\nDhillon, Burns and Hardy all come close\nwhen put through by both Hatton and Cable.\nDhillon was about to float a long throw-in into\nthe LSE box when the referee blew for full-time. IC V had become the first football team\nto achieve \"the double\" for years.\nA special mention must go to the substitute\nKen Baldwin, and the many supporters who\nturned up to cheer us on, including IC's lucky\nCup Final mascot \u2014 Shirley Coarses Wellies.\nTEAM: Duncan Brown, Nigel Audin, Al\nCable, Barry Hatton, Paul Gohil, Damian\nKelly, Ian Archer, Dave Hardy, John Healy,\nJohn Burns, Bob Dhillon. Sub Ken Baldwin.\nWater Polo\nIC v St. Thomas Hospital\n9 \u2014 1\nIN a match at UL U pool last Tuesday, IC\nscored a crushing victory against St Thomas'\nHospital. With one goal against us in the first\n'quarter'. Boucher scored two fine goals in\nquick succession to regain the team's collective confidence. From then on, IC just\nkept on scoring, marking tightly and generally passing well.\nAll credit to everybody involved for a fine\nperformance. If Westminster Hospital don't scratch out next week again we'll try and\nrepeat our success.\nTEAM: Boucher (2), Last (2), Kilgour (1),\nBradley (1), Leach (1), Porter (1). Ashwin (1),\nHeffernan (goalie).\nTennis\nTHE first match of the year took place on\nWednesday, March 4 away against Kings\nCollege.\nThe result, never in doubt, was an easy 6 V22 V2 win to IC.\nThe first pair only dropping five games, and\nthe second pair winning all of their six sets.\nLeaving the third pair with V2p t(1 set) to their\ncredit.\nThanks to Tony for driving and the reserve\nfor turning up.\nThe summer looks promising, but we will\nneed players with exams at different times as\nthe matches go on throughout the term. So\ndon't worry \u2014 if you want a match your\ntalents will be called upon if last year was\nanything to go by.\nTEAM: Waas, Haeger, Tscoukkas, Pike,\nCornwell, Page.\nTen Pin Bowling\nHISTORY was made at the Leeds Doubles\nTournament last Saturday. The IC team made\nit to the semi-finals. The first Imperial team to\ndo so ever. There were six teams in each heat\nand each team had to play all the other teams.\nIC were in Group G and only lost one game\nout of the five played and walked home overall on pi nf al I. The semi-finals consisted\nof four teams playing against each other. The\ncompetition here was tough and IC lost the\nfirst game but pulled back by winning their\nsecond game. At this stage every team stood\na chance of reaching the final from this semifinal group. Unfortunately, after a poor third\ngame, IC was knocked out. Congratulations\nmust go to Engwell and Knight, the IC team,\nfor a good day's bowling.\nThe two other IC teams did not have such a good day and were both knocked out in the\nheats, even though good matches were\nplayed against very good competition. Thanks to Man, Smith, Quinn and Cook for\ncontributing to an outstanding Imperial\npresence. Thanks again to John Knight for\nproviding transport.\nSnooker\nYOU could have knocked me down with a feather when it became apparent that the B team were going to lose to LSE last Wednesday. The final result was 3-2, after we\nlost the first three frames we seemed doomed\nto ahu millia ting defeat. However fine\nperformances by Bennett and myself saved\nour reputation. It now looks as if the B team\nwill not be league champions this season,\nmainly because of the upsets in the team's structure over the last few weeks.\nThe A team is going from strength to\nstrength and capitalizing on the poor performance of its rivals. They won handsomely against QM C by only dropping one\nframe. They are on the verge of total boredom if they win the league.\nThe C team provided everyone with laughs\nas they scraped a narrow victory over LSE's second team. Their performance was their\nusual cautionary, tactless effort.\nSailing\nLAST weekend saw the British Universities\nSailing Association Trials at the Welsh Harp.\nOut of thirty-five competitors from all over\nthe country, Lewis and Baxter, both of\nPhysics 2, won through in convincing form to\ntake two of the six places in the team.\nChris Lewis won two of the three races he\nsailed. Unfortunately in the third race his\nboat's mast snapped.\nJames Baxter won one race and came\nsecond in his only other, and happily didn't wreck any boats.\n' Wrecker' Lewis was later asked to be\nCaptain of the BUS A Team which is to sail the\nAmerican Universities in the summer.\nLadies Rugby\nIC v Warwick 4*16\nLAST Sunday, the intrepid IC Ladies 14 set\nout for Warwick just in time to stop anyone\ngetting a drink beforehand! We arrived to find\nour opposition with 13 players \u2014 things were\nlooking up!\nPlay was very slow due to the muddy conditions, but unfortunately they weren't as\nslow as we were, and they scored their first\ntry after about ten minutes. Possession was\nfia rly even during the first half, although\nWarwick were allowed to score again shortly\nbefore half-time. IC started the second half a lot better, and for ten minutes we put them\nunder a lot of pressure, keeping play within\ntheir 22. However, the moving mountain they\nhad at fly-half then got the ball, and ran the\nlength of the pitch to score their third try. For\nthe whole of the second half we had a lot\nmore possession, but could not seem to\nscore. Then in the last couple of minutes,\nafter yet another five-yard scrum, Mary sent\ntheir fly-half 'flying' as she tried to kick the\nball, and Andree dropped on it to score, just\nbefore the final whistle blew.\nTEAM: Lois, Sara, Jane, Pam, Steph,\nAndress, Mary (Capt), Rad, Sabs, Les, Jill,\nHelen, Cathy, Ruth.\nFELIX.

This rebate cannot be back\ndated so it is important to set the\nwheels in motion well beforehand.\nUnfortunately 'holiday' and 'com-p any' lets and accommodation\nshared with the landlord are all still\noutside the range of rent or rate\nrebates, but you may be eligible for\nother benefits and it is always\npossible to take a 'holiday let' to the\ncounty court for re classification when it is obvious that the tenants\nare not on holiday.\nFor those who haven't applied for\nany benefits before and would like\nsome more information here's an\nupdated version of last term's article\non the various ways and means\nwhereby rent payable over the\nholidays can be wholly or partially\noffset.\nSupplementary Benefit\nFor most students this benefit can\nonly be claimed during the holidays\nwhen you are available for work and\ncan register as unemployed. The\nvacation element of the grant\n(\u00a319.20) is approximately equal to\nthe single persons basic SB allow\nance, so these two cancel out\nleaving any rent payable during this\nperiod as the only additional sum\nthat can be claimed. Entitlement to\nthis benefit is only valid when you are\nsigning on regularly as unemployed\nin the same area as the one in which\nyou are paying rent. However, it is\npossible to get a holiday form,\nallowing you up to sixteen days away\nfrom your London address. Alternatively, if you are away for a field\ntrip during the vacation or remain in\nLondon for an extension of your\ncourse it should be possible to get\nyour LEA to award you a supple\nment ary maintenance grant.\nHow To Apply For SB\n1. Register as available for work on\nthe first weekday of the vacation at\nyour nearest Job Centre.\n2. Assuming that there is no\nsuitable job available ask to be\nregistered as unemployed. You will\nbe given a card and form Bl.3. The card is taken to the unemployment benefit office (often in the\nsame building as the Job Centre)\nwhere you will receive instructions\nabout signing on regularly.\n4. Form Bl is taken to the Supplementary Benefit Office. An appointment system is normally in operation,\nso it may save time if you phone\nthem first. It will also save time if you\nhave all the necessary documents\nwith you when you go to the SB\nOffice to be assessed. These are as\nfollows: a rent book/ tenancy agreement/letter from landlord or\nthe Student Services Office if you\nare in College accommodation, Welfare\nincluding proof that you are resident\nat the address stated, a recent bank\nstatement and a students' union card or other proof of identity.\nThe amount of benefit that you\nreceive may not be your total rent\nbill as various sums may be deducted,\nsuch as \u00a34.35pw if heating is\nincluded in the rent, since this sum is\nincluded in the basic SB allowance\nalready balanced off by your grant.\nAlso, if your rent has not been\nregistered by the rent officer or rent\ntribunal and seems higher than\naverage the calculations may be\nbased on a rent more in line with\nsimilar ac com mod at in that has been\nfair rented. Apart from this the\nDHS S( Dept of Health and Social\nSecurity) have a ceiling of \u00a319 for\nsingle householders, \u00a314 for share rs, \u00a324 for a double beds it and \u00a324 for a one bedroomed flat. The term\nhouseholder implies someone who is\nindividually responsible for all\nhousehold expenses. However it is\nnot precisely defined, so even if you\nlive in a flat or house with other\nstudents and have your own room,\nmeters, etc, it may be possible to\nargue that y pu are maintaining a separate household. Furthermore, if\nyou share a flat and will be the only\ntenant remaining during the holiday\nyou will be a single householder for\nthe relevant period. A person living\nas one of the family is classified by\nthe DHS S as a non-householder. The\nway that SB is worked out for\nshare rs is to classify them as non-householders with a special addition\nequal to their share of the difference\nbetween the householder and the\nnon-householder scale rates (see\nfigures below).\nTo calculate your own SB, first\ncalculate your requirements, then\nyour resources. Next subtract your\nresources from your requirements.\nThe amount you are left with should\nbe the amount payable per week.\nRequirements\nNon-householder \u00a317.05+rent\nSharer\n\u00a317.05 + (\u00a34.25 + no. of share rs)+ rent\nHouseholder \u00a321.30+rent\nResources\nVacation element of grant \u00a319.20\nplus any part-time earnings (\u00a34\ndisregarded)\nThe rate for one student sharing\nwith four others paying\u00a315each would be: \u00a317.05+ \u00a31.06+ \u00a315 \u00a319.20 =\n\u00a313.91.\nThe calculations for your SB will\nbe sent to you and if you disagree\nwith the assessment you are entitled\nto appeal within twenty-one days.\nAnd don't forget that anyone\nreceiving SB can automatically get\nfree NHS dental treatment, glasses\nand prescriptions. So if you think\nyou might be needing any of them\nask for an exemption certificate\nwhile you're at the DHSS Office.\nRent And Rate Rebates\nThese are available for anyone\n(apart from the above mentioned\nexceptions) with a low income. They\ndo not normally offset so much of\nthe rent as Supplementary Benefit,\nbut they can be paid even while you\nare away and do not entail all the\nrigmarole of 'signing on'.\nHow Rent And Rate Rebates Are\nWorked Out\nAs with SB the rent is firstly equated\nwith similar accommodation which\nhas been fair rented. Then a25% deduction is usually made for\nfurniture, with a further amount\ndeducted (up to 25%) if heating is\nincluded in the rent. The rate\nelement ( approx25%) is also\nremoved, but this will be subject to\nits own rebate. The basic rebate will\nbe between 20% and 30% of the\nremaining figure. The percentage\nvaries according to the rent payable,\nshrinking as the rent increases.\nHowever if you're income is less\nthan \u00a334.90 (the single person's housing benefit needs allowance), as\nit normally will be during the\nvacation, then 25% of the difference\nbetween the income and the needs\nallowance is added to the basic\nfigure. If your income is more than\nthe needs allowance then the basic\nrate is reduced by 17% of the\ndifference between the income and\nthe needs allowance. For those\nstudents who apply during term time some additional calculations (which I won't go into here) complicate\nthings further, making it pointless\napplying unless your income is well\nbelow average.\nExample for a student paying a fair rent of \u00a315pw( not including\nheating or rates) less 25% for\nfurniture:\nRent:\u00a311.25.25% Basic Rebate: \u00a32.80.\n\u00a334.90 (needs allowance) - \u00a319.20 (in-come) = \u00a315.70. 25% rebate: \u00a33.90.\nTotal Rebate: (\u00a32.80 + \u00a33.90) \u00a36.70.\nIf a rate rebate is applicable this\npart is not subject to any initial\nreductions, but the calculations tend\nto be even more tortuous without\nproviding a very clear indication of\nthe final outcome. The above\nexample may not be typical since the\nrent officers stress that each\napplication is unique and subject to\nits own variations. However, it\nwould seem that the return is well\nworth a trip to the Town Hall, if\nyou're not eligible for Supplementary\nBenefit or Unemployment Benefit,\nso give it a try and let us know how\nyou get on.\nHow To Apply For Rent And\nRate Rebates\n1. It's best to phone your Town Hall\nfirst to discover their interview\nprocedure and establish just where\nthe relevant office is since it may not\nbe in the main building.\n2. Don't forget to have all the\nnecessary identification, proof of\nrent and bank statement with you\n(as described when applying for SB)\nfor anything missing will mean\nanother visit and possibly lost rebate\nsince it only begins when they have\nestablished all the relevant facts.\nUnemployment Benefit\nLast, but by no means least, this is\nthe one to go for if you can. In order\nto be eligible you will need to have\npaid Class1 contributions on\nearnings of at least \u00a3875 between\nApril 1978 and April 1979 or \u00a3976\nbetween April 1979 and April 1980.\nThis will give you a basic rate of\n\u00a320.65 without any other complications, indeed you may get more if\nyou have earn t enough to qualify for\nthe earnings related supplement.\nTo claim: go to your local\nUnemployment Benefit Office on the\nfirst day of the vacation. Any earlier\nthan this they will turn you away,\nany later and you may lose money\nsince payment cannot normally be\nback dated. Take your P45 with\nyou or a note of your national insurance number.\nIf you run into any problems when\nclaiming these benefits let us know\nsince we may be able to help and we\nappreciate any information that can\nusefully be passed on to others.\nNEAREST OFFICES\nfor College Head Tenancies\nHamlet Gardens\nJob Centre and Unemployment\nOffice: 200 Shepherds Bush Rd, W6.\nTele: 603 3456.\nSupplementary Benefit Office:\nCharles House, 375 High St Kensington, W14.

Both Sean and Dave laughed when shown a copy.\nEngineering Professors\nwant fewer students\nENGINEERING professors are to call for a major reduction in numbers\nof engineering students studying at universities. At its annual assembly\nthis month, the engineering professors conference is expected to pass a resolution calling for a25% reduction in future numbers ol engineering\nstudents, a drop from the present figure of about 10,000 to 7,500.\nThe move, which is being recommended by the committee of the\nconference, is being put forward to ensure that the new four-year\ndegree courses, proposed by the national conference on engineering\neducation and training, can be introduced.\nProfessor Robert Smith, Chairman of the conference, said that if\npresent student numbers were kept at the university for a further year,\nthe present \u00a3270m annual cost of engineering education would be\nraised by a further \u00a380m.\"In the present economic climate there is\nlittle chance of getting that money,\" he added.\nInstead, it is proposed that the engineering student population\nshould be kept at present levels but would remain at university lor an\nextra year. This would reduce available places by 25%, cutting\nadditional costs, and four year degrees to about \u00a310m. The engineering professors plan, which follows discussions between\nthem and the University Grants Committee and the Department of\nEducation and Science, is being proposed because of their enthusiastic\nendorsement of the four-year degree plan.\nRag Chairman\n& Treasurer kicked out\nTHIS YEAR'S Rag Chairman, Ian Hodgson, and Rag Treasurer,\nEira Hayward, resigned last week, after a motion calling for their\nresignations was passed by the Rag Committee.\nIan Hodgson was slammed for his lack of enthusiasm and lack of\norganisational ability, in particular his failure to attract sponsorship for\nthe deaf children's party this weekend. Eira Hayward was criticised for\nher continued absence from the IC Union Office thus delaying\npayments to charities, and her failure to order slop shirts for sale in the\nUnion Office.\nWhen the new Rag Chairman is elected alter Thursday'sU GM, he\nwill take over immediately from the three C CU Vice-Presidents and\nAlan Edwards (Rag Secretary) who are currently running IC Rag.\nThe election for Rag Treasurer will be held at the Rag Committee\nmeeting on Thursday, March19. Steve Tyson, Rag Publicity Officer, also resigned at the meeting last\nweek.\nMary Whitehouse\ncalls off visit\nMARY WHITEHOUSE, a leading member of the 'clean up\nThe Press and T.V pressure\ngroups, and a campaigner against\nindecent and degrading displays\nand publications did not come to\nImperial College yesterday. She\nwas to have given a lecture on\n\"Twenlie/h Century Morals\" as part\nof a series on \"Christianity Today.''\nThis is the second time that Mrs Whitehouse has had to postpone\nher engagement at IC. Last term\nthe cancellation was due to illness,\nbut FELIX can only speculate as\nto the reason this time.\nGuilds win\nSwimming Gala\nLAST MONDAY evening saw\nthe Inter C CU Swimming Galata king place in the College swimming pool. Teams from\nGuilds won the men's water polo,\nand both the men's and women's swimming races. The presidential\nrace, however, where participants\nswim blind-folded and with l our fully inflated water wings, was\nwon by RCS, despite Dave Gayer looking like Duncan Goodhew. Mines did not enter\nthe competition.\nRae Snee\nsnatch attempt\nTHE OLD RIVALRY between\nChelsea College, QE C and\nImperial was rekindled last week\nwhen students attempted to\nkidnap the ICU Deputy President. Rae Snee.\nTwo students from Chelsea\ncame to the FELIX office, on\nWednesday night, and asked,\n\" Where are your Union officers? -It's important.\" We gave them\nthe number of Rae's room in Beit\nHall. The Deputy President was\nfortunately in the company of Mr Steve Tyson. After listening to a feeble attempt to entice Rae out of\nher room. Mr Tyson leapt across\nthe floor and slammed the door.\nThis incident follows Monday's QE C raid on Chelsea College.\nTen 'heavies' claiming to be from\nImperial forcibly kidnapped the\nChelsea President and demanded\nthe donation of 30 pints of blood\nfor his release (a paltry amount - Ed).\nCity University made an\nattempt last term to abduct Dave\nGayer, Guilds President, but\nmistakenly nabbed John Passmore. Realising their mistake, Mr Passmore was\nquickly released, which must say\nsomething for his importance.\nIt seems that Imperial has been\nfairly passive in the field of\nmascot ry and pillage so far this\nyear. Is the Wooden Horse\nOrganisation dead or merely\ndormant?\nHead Blow!\nA CHEMISTRY P.O., Andy Mac Mahon was detained in\nhospital alter falling oil Beit\nArchway, whilst climbing around\nit on Tuesday evening. He was\ntaken by ambulance to St\nStephen's Hospital with a large\ngash over his eye. He was kept\nunder observation with suspected\nconcussion for 24 hours.\nBlow Head!\nPROFESSOR DM Blow PhD, FRS is to be the next Dean of the\nRoyal College of Science. He will\ntake over from Professor W KH ayman MA, FCD, Hon ARCS, FRS, at the beginning ol\nSeptember. Professor Blow will be\nDean lor three years and will\ncoordinate the academic work in\nthe RCS lor that period.\nNUS demand\ngrant rise\nStudent representatives met Dr Rhodes Boyson, under-secretary\nlor higher education, this week to\npress their case for a21% increase\nin grants amid widespread local\naction in support of the claim.\nDemonstrations were held in\nGlasgow, Dundee. Aberdeen and\nEdinburgh, while in England\nstudents lobbied MPs and local\nauthorities. They want a15% increase to keep pace within lla lion and a further 6% to\ncompensate lor a low award last\nyear.\nThe National Union of Students believes that without this\nincrease, some students could be\nforced to abandon their courses,\nand that already many students\nlaced hardship in meeting hall\nfees well above the \u00a3835 element\nallowed at present for board and\nlodging. The basic grant would\ngo up from \u00a31,430 to \u00a31,740.\nSince 1978 the grant has risen\nby 30% in value, but prices have\ngone up by 35%, travel costs by\n41%, and board and lodging by\n57%.\nBoyson opts\nfor loans scheme\nDi Boyson has decided on his\nfavourite option for a mixed grants and loans scheme and will\nshortly put it to a Cabinet committee The scheme, which would replace the present system of\nmandatory and discretionary grants, is believed to involve a flat-rate grant of about \u00a3500\nlopped up by loans administered\nby the Department of E duc ation and Science. The loans would\nbe repaid when the graduate's earnings rose above a certain\nlevel. Tuition lees would continued to be paid in lull for home\nstudents.\nSir Geoffrey\nat odds with IC\nTHE Rt HON Sir Geoffrey Howe\nM.

If these people thought that\nthe Union was going wrong, why\ndidn't they step in a few months\nago and give some useful help.\nOkay, so it might have been a less\nthan dynamic year for the Union, but who can cast the first\nstone? The Exec should not be\nused as scapegoats lor all the\nshortcomings as they are not the\nonly members of the Union.

He says he fails to see how\nany political group can get a meaningful result from such a poll. However, the first four\nsections were concerned with items of general interest to students not with party political\npoints, and the last part( on C ND) was included as a response\nto the interest in the subject\nbeing generated by ICC ND themselves here.\n2. We dispute his claim that\ndifferent -wording and ordering of\nthe C ND questions would have\ngiven a 'quite opposite response',\nthe questions were worded in a neutral fashion, and directly prove the major planks of the\nC ND argument.\n3. Regarding the U GM of\nDecember 2, the C ND motion\nwas debated in a highly charged\natmosphere, and to put it mildly,\nwas not opposed in the most\ninformative way it could have\nbeen, thus giving the proposer,\nOwen Green e,very much a monopoly of credibility. The Consoc poll allowed people to\nmake their minds up coolly and individually and we regard the\nC ND findings as valid.\nYours sincerely\nTim Lawes\nTreasurer, Consoc\nDear Sir\nOver the past term Consoc has\nin various ways sought to curtail\nor denigrate the activities of Imperial College C ND Group. I am glad they take us seriously.\nUntil now I have been unable to\nconsider them in the same light,\nbut their tactics impel me to\nobject via your columns.\nApart from a selective questionnaire and an uninformative\neditorial in their newsletter,\nConsoc has distributed a leaflet\nsupporting the case for deployment of Cruise missiles. Amongst\nother distortions and unsupported\nemotive language, this includes\nthe argument that Russian military spending (17% of GNP compared to 5.2% of US GNP) indicates a relative Russian build-up. This comparison is a nonsense. Apart from the validity\nof these statistics (no references\nare given in the leaflet), the\nimportant figure is the total\nexpenditure($163 billion for Warsaw Pact countries against\n$164.7billion for NATO countries in1977 \u2014 not including\nFrance \u2014 is quoted by the US Arms Control and Development\nAgency; hardly Soviet pro pog and a). Regardless of the rights or wrongs of Consoc's or C ND's beliefs, for a group of people\nengaged in higher education at a scientific college to use this kind\nof distorted logic to support their\ncase is absolutely disgraceful. It\nweakens Consoc's credibility.\nI question both the intelligence\nand the ethics of those responsible\nfor this scurrilous propaganda.\nTours in disgust\nIan Heavens\nPhysics PG IC C ND Group Dear Sir\nI would like to thank all those\nwho took part in the Un dug u Charity Sponsored walk despite\nSaturday's bad weather.

    "content": "Hustings UGM Results UGM\nUGM Shocker\nFELIX Editor\nthwarts bid to oust him\nLast Thursday the Hustings UGM was held before a packed\nGreat Hall, and broadcast live on STOIC and IC Radio. The\nmeeting also discussed a motion of dismissal of the FELIX\nEditor.\nThe meeting opened after 1:00pm with over live hundred people\npresent. The STOIC lights glared down on the Exec table at the front,\nand the first of the large number of paper planes to be thrown during\nthe meeting took to the air. Mark Gillette quickly moved that the\nmotion on the FELIX Editor should be discussed after the Hon See's Business, and this was accepted on the vote. The President, DP and\nHon Sec gave their respective Exec News reports, and these\nwere all accepted.\nDave Pinnegar then proposed the motion against the FELIX Editor.\nMr Pinnegar relied heavily on the argument that by his editorial\ncomments and otherwise Mr Marshall had laid the Union open to suits\nfor defamation of character and libel. He argued that the editor should\nnot have made the comments he did about Princess Anne. Mr Pinnegar\nreceived two extensions to give him four minutes speaking time. These\nwere readily agreed to by the meeting.\nAt this point, Graham King proposed an amendment to delete the\nclause \"the present F\"ELIX Editor shall be deemed dismissed'' and\nto insert a clause withdrawing the Editor's sabbatical grant for one\nweek. He thought a \"no confidence'' motion was too severe, but that the\nEditor needed to be reprimanded. David Pinnegar spoke against the\namendment and it was not carried.\nAt this point Patrick Coll, FELIX Stall' Orator rose to address the\nmeeting. Speaking on behalf of Mr Marshall, he outlined the\nprocedure by which a sabbatical can be dismissed, pointing out that a motion passed at two UG Ms with two thirds majority were required to\nremove the Editor. It would take to the middle of next term to remove\nhim from office. \" This meeting,\" he said, \"is probably the best\nattended and most representative U GM this session and therefore it\nprovides the best test of opinion of the student body at this College. The\nvoting on this motion will be more than a test of opinion, it is a vote\nof no confidence in Steve Marshall, and in FELIX this year.\n\" Unlike the Union Executive, Mr Marshall is a man of definite\nopinion and beliefs and does not treat this motion lightly. He is only\nwilling to edit the newspaper as his judgment allows, or not at all, and\nhe has no wish to stay in office on technicalities. Therefore, if this\nmotion is passed against him by the required majority here today, he\nwill immediately tender his resignation as FELIX Editor. If a motion\nof no confidence is to be passed, then it should mean what it says. If it is\nhonestly your opinion that he should go . . then he will.\n\" In that event FELIX will be edited by the Hon Sec who cannot\nrealistically be expected to do two people's jobs well. The standard of\nF'ELIX will fall, and an outlet lor student opinion would be lost.\nVoting for this motion serves no useful purpose vote against it\". After this, Mark Gillette summed up lor the motion, referring to the\nlibel issues, adding that DrM on ro was considering suing the Union, but he made no reference to the editor's threatened resignation. The\nmotion then went to a vote, which was a hand count as the issue was\nregarded as sufficiently important. The voting was 232 lor, 227 against\nwith 46 abstentions. Therefore, the motion was not passed by the\nrequired majority.\nThe meeting then moved on to the hustings lot sabbatical president,\ndeputy president and honorary secretary. Alter this, a procedural\nmotion was passed to allow the El Salvador motion to be considered\nnext. The motion expressed solidarity with the people of El Salvador in their current situation. An amendment, to send John Passmore to El Salvador, was not put, and t he motion was defeated.\nAt this point Dare Afolabi proposed a procedural motion that the\nBrandt Report motion be considered next. Jon Firth, U GM Chairman, however refused to accept the motion, and Mr Aiolabi then\nproposed a motion challenging the Chairman's ruling. This was\noverwhelmingly defeated on the vote. The meeting went on to pass\nthree ByeLaw changes on their first reading. These concerned extending the grounds on which College staff may become life members\nof the Union, disbanding I CW A and placing the Ents Chairman on\nCouncil. At this stage, Steve Goulder moved a motion for adjournment\nand this was passed 75-67 at 3:20pm. Next year's Sabbaticals: Mark Smith (FELIX Ed) in foreground and (left to right)\nMarco Ledwold (Hon Sec), Nick Morton (President), Barney McCabe (DP).\nNext Year's Sabbaticals\nNext year's Sabbatical Officers are to be Nick Morton,\nPresident; Barney McCabe, Deputy President, and Marco\nLedwold, Honorary Secretary. The results were announced at\nthe Results UGM yesterday afternoon.\nThe meeting opened at 1:15pm to about 350 people in the Great\nHall, but without ' Mike', ICU's mascot, present.\nThe President briefly pointed out an article in that day's Times\nwhich said that the University Grants Commission were going to make\nrepresentations to the Government about education cuts. The Deputy\nPresident, announced that the Union estimates would go in to College\nfor considerations next Tuesday.\nThe Hon Sec, Liz Lindsay, announced the retirement ol'John Fuller\na popular College Traffic Warden, and presented him with ICU Social\nColours.\nJohn Passmore, as sabbatical returning officer announced the\nelection results. These were:\nPresident Hon Secretary\nNick Morton1,121 First Allocation\nAl'tab Gujral 521 Marco Led wold647 Abstentions 33 Pete Newman348 Spoilt 19 Kirsten Pratt 490\nDeputy President Abstentions 103\nB McCabe1,042 s Poll t106N Moran462 Aller\nreallocation\nAbstentions 74 Marco Ledwold 804\nSpoilt 116 Kirsten Pratt 536\nThe total poll in each election was 1,694. After these results, Mark Smith, next year's FELIX Editor, made a short statement outlining his\nplans for his term of oll ice. Liz Lindsay took over as returning officer at this point in the\nmeeting. Hustings were held for U GM Chairman, between Steve\nGoulder and Phil Merry man. The meeting ratified the election of Ian\nGreenwood as UL U Rep, Martin Taylor as External Affairs Officer,\nand Sean Coyle as ICCA G Chairman( the only candidates). Hustings\nwere held for the post of Rag Chairman between Mark Wilkins, Bi.l Durodie and Deborarh Nicholls.\nA point of order was made asking the Chairman to tell the STOIC cameraman to turn his headphones down as it was disturbing having to\nlisten to them. This request was accepted.\nHusting was thus held for the post of Academic Affairs Officer,\nbetween Lee Paddon and Mike Booty.\nThe U GM went on to the motions, and a procedural move was\nmade to place a motion on William Cortazzi (instructing that he\nshould be thrown in the ' Round Pond') at the head of the agenda.\nBefore it could be voted on, William Cortazzi successfully challenged\nQuorum, showed his Unioncard and withdrew hastily from the Great\nHall. Most other people there though stayed on for an informal discussion\non the motion.\nThe results of the elections held by paper ballot at the U GM were\nannounced later, and Steve Goulder, Bill Durodie and Mike Booty\nwere ele c ted. Papers for Welfare Officer are to remain up on the Lower\nLounge noticeboard as no one has stood lor the post.\nFELIX, March 13,1981 Page 3\n\n"

Despite this, the sound was\namazingly pure with all five band members\nclearly discern able. The band is over in\nEngland for a short, virtually unannounced\ntour to promote their new album, Light of my\nTown, available on RCA (France).\nThe set featured most of the new album,\nalthough the emphasis was on the fast\nrock'n 'roll songs, such as Switchboard Julie\nand Rockin Down My Street. Slower songs\nsuch as the title track of the album, relying\nmore on keyboards, came over less well.

The fact\nthat she remains unscathed is as amazing as\nher youthful looks, considering that this is the\nGrace of Jefferson Airplane/Starship White\nRabbit St Charles fame.\nAnd the album is even more amazing\nmaking Motorhead sound like Joe Dolce on\nacid. The title track, one of only three co-penned by Slick with lead guitarist/vocalist\nScott Zito (the rest being by Zito alone), opens\nwith a mindless mayhem interspersed with\nbursts of pneumatic drill. The sound is\nsuggestive of oily denim clad BO smelling\nbikers rather than the elegant, sophisticated\nlady standing in the terrified 'no, please! \u2014\ndon't send me to disco dance classes' pose.\nNot for the nervously disposed \u2014 this album\nbears little resemblance to anything Jefferson.\nOnly one song, Shooting Star has Starship\novertones, with Zito sounding like Paul\nKant ner John Miller\nScaramouche\nI am a notoriously heavy sleeper, and\nbecause of this I am quite certain that all alarm\nclocks regard me with suspicion and hatred.\nIndeed, the only clock which has ever got the\nbetter of me was one of those sadistic Goblin\ndevices which squirt boiling water over you if\nyou don't get up in time. Happily, it drowned\nitself one day when I was out; I have spurned\nteas made s since.\nStill, my present bedside clock nearly had\nme fooled recently. What happened was this:\nin the early hours of this morning there was a power cut, and so I went to bed. Because of\nthe power cut, I expected the clock to be slow\nthe following morning, and so when I awoke I turned on the radio to listen for a time-check.\nI was rather puzzled by the first time check;\nthe clock appeared to show exactly the right\ntime. Fifty minutes later there was another\ntime-check and the clock appeared to be an\nhour and forty minutes slow. When the third\ntime check made my clock appear fifty\nminutes slow I was wondering whether to\nconcede defeat; after all, there couldn't have\nbeen another power cut, or the radio would\nhave stopped. Happily, just before lunch I realised what had been confusing me. Each\ntime I thought I had been looking at the clock, I had been looking at its reflection in my bedside\nmirror. This was at 12:15 precisely. How did\nthe reflection of the clock appear then?\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me\nc/o FELIX Office.
