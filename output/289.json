The main recommendations are (i) the office of Vice\nPresident of the Union to be\nabolished in favour of a new\npost of Charity Carnival\nOrganiser in an attempt to\nstreamline Carnival collecting in RCS. For long\nenough the Vice President\nhas had no worthwhile official function to perform,\nsave decorating Union meetings and impersonating\nTheta.\n(ii) The number of Union\nmeetings is to be slashed to\nfour per academic year.\nThese will be a fresher s meet-B.O. S.T. RUMOURS\nRumours have been received about the discussion\nat the Feb. 18th BOST\n(Board of Studies) meeting\nwhich 'decided to decide at\nor after the end of term' on\nstudent representation. The\ndecision, although quite in-conclusive, represents a victory for the moderates and\nprogressives on the BOST.\nThe main opposition\ngroup consisted of Profs\nBarrer (Head of Chemistry),\nBall (Head of Metallurgy),\nUbbelohde (Head of Chem.\nEng.), Sparkes (Dean of C. and G., Civ. Eng.), and\nFleming (Dean RSM, Head\nof Mining and Min. Tech.).\nAt the meeting minority objections were raised about\nPresident Corbyn \u2014 that he\nand 'his friends' were not\nrepresentative, and he was\nunwelcome on the BOST.\nOn hearing this rumour\nafterwards, Corbyn said that\nobviously \u2014 like any president \u2014 he was not an\naverage student, but that he\nput forward explored and\nexpressed Union policies, as\ndecided by the Union. \"Pre-sum ably certain Profs would\nlike students on the BOST\nwho did or could not do\nthis,\" he said.\ning at the beginning of the\nAutumn term; a hustings\nmeeting in the Spring term\nto be followed by a meeting\nwhen the election results will\nbe declared; and an AGM at\nthe end of the year.\n(iii) Constitutional changes will in future only require a two thirds majority\nat one Union meeting, instead of needing to be\napproved at two successive\nmeetings as at present. This\nis clearly a rational step with\na reduction of the number of\nmeetings to four.\n(iv) The welfare of RCS\nstudents will in future be\nsolely in the hands of ICU \u2014\nthe body best felt equipped\nto look after this matter.\nUnder the present constitution, this new constitution\nmust be approved by tw<S Union meetings and having\nbeen passed by those present\non the 17th, must go before\nanother meeting to be held\nin the very near future. It is\nto be hoped that a lot more\npeople turn up then to discuss this important matter.\nHowever at the present\ntime it appears that it's going\nto take a lot more than a new constitution to inject\nnew spirit into a very ailing\ninstitution. Dynamic leadership is an absolute necessity for the future of RCSU\nas an institution worth pre-serving: at the moment such\nleadership is sadly lacking.\nCorbyn = N.U.S.? Piers Corbyn has been\nnominated for a post on\nNUS executive to one of the\n7 junior posts (executive\nofficer or executive committee member). The elections take place at the NUS National Conference. The\npost is not sabbatical and\nCorbyn has said that since\nthere are 80 full-time staff\nin NUS he can and will\nmake sure that the post does\nnot interfere with his Physics.\nHe hopes to make students\n'more aware'. He would be\none of the very few science\nstudents on NUS executive\nif elected.\nFelixprobes - a Hop\n\"It's all at the hop.\" So runs a line in a pop song which\nany reader over twenty will remember. To check whether\nthe old adage still holds in this permissive age, I decided to\ntry the latest 1970-style I.C. hop, the main attraction being\nFree, despite the fact that tickets cost 10 shillings. (One\nhopes that when the fifty new pence appear at I.C. the arrangement will be reciprocated, and free admission will be\nallowed).\nHaving passed through the outer defences, the second\nline proved easily penetrable, and there it was, the Hop.\nA quick half, (no pint glasses), in the Union Lower\nwith my friend, and then up to the Concert Hall where it\nwas all happening. We had arrived just before Free were\nabout to begin their stint. The first point that was brought\nhome was that the old cattle-market image of the Hop has\ngone, and I am told that with the better quality groups this\nyear, the majority of the people come to listen, and since\nthis is more comfortably done sitting down, sit down they\ndo. The cattle-market has now moved to the discotheque,\nand having acquired one's catch, the after sales service begins with watching the group.\nFree obviously command quite a large following, for\nhalf the Concert Hall was filled with people sitting down.\nThe fans were obviously pleased with the group's performance, for after an hour of hard rock an encore was called\nand answered. The group's music was supplemented by an\nagile display by the lead singer dancing with the mike stand,\nand also by the grotesque facial expressions of the lead\nguitarist.\nThe old adage still holds. \"It's all at the hop.\"\nUNION MEETING\nMeeting opened at 1.17\nand the minutes, just for a change, were read to about\n280 students. Steve Cooke\nwas declared Maths departmental rep., being uno p posed, and aMr. Hedley declared Mech. Eng. dep. rep.\nalso unopposed. Piers said a short tribute to the late\nLord Jackson, and there was\na letter from Frances Campbell on behalf W. L.S.A. B., the West London Students\nAccommodation Bureau, which is now living at 8\nPrinces' Gardens.\nAfter a letter from the\nA A thanking us for our\nsupport, Dave Yorath of the\nNUS talked on the future of\nthe Architectural Association, and then the fun\nstarted with a letter from\nStephenson in his capacity\nas chairman of the Refectory\ncommittee.\nThe letter was about the\nlast Union meeting, and\nwas based mainly on several\nniggling complaints about\ntime - keeping, quo racy doubts. One quote was \"I doubt whether more than 3\nor 4 students know what a pot-washing machine is.\"\nAfter the letter was read,\nJohn Goodman promptly\nproposed a motion of no-confidence in Mr. Stephenson as chairman of the re-factories committee, and described the letter as \"bloody\ndisgusting.\"\nDave Howard spoke\nagainst the motion with\nsome lack of sincerity (in-tended) and the motion was\ncarried overwhelmingly.\nProfessor Alexander of\nthe Mechanical Engineering\ndept. rose to ask what students hope to contribute to\nthe BOST or other com-mitte es. When asked if he\nwas a member of the Union\nhe replied that he was a life\nmember, as were most members of staff, who did not\nbother to come to Union\nmeetings because they\nthought the students could\ncontrol their own affairs. In\nreply to his original ques-tion, Dave Wield pointed\nout that they had contributed to the workings of the\nBOST already, in that the\nBOST had been talking\nabout them since last June.\nJohn MacAdam spoke in\nfavour of withdrawing all\nrepresentation from the com-mitte es, but went on to suggest we set up our own administration in opposition to\nthe college.\nLes Ebdon accused Prof.\nAlexander of admitting that\nhe knew nothing of what\nthe students wanted, and\nsaid that no sooner was representation allowed on a committee than all power\nwas withdrawn from it. The\nwhole thing was a farce, he\nsaid. Dave Howard spoke\nagain against direct action,\nand someone immediately\nproposed a speech advocating just that. This motion\noccupied the rest of the time\nof the Union meeting, which\nclosed in no recognisable\nmanner about quarter past\ntwo.\nSee Felicity Report as\nwell.\nGIRLS!

C.1st XV reached their 3rd Gutteridge Cup final in 5\nyears\u2014this time, it is hoped,\nto emerge as victors.\nAfter a very hard fight\nagainst Q.M. C. in the quarter finals I.C. expected a tough game \u2014 indeed the\nnoise and behaviour of some\nof the Cemian supporters\n(pissed again?) gave the\ntouch line the air (and\nblood?) of a battle field!\nHowever, on the field at\nleast, I.C. emerged as clear\ncut winners even though the\nscore included 4 penalty\ngoals.\nIfor Rhys opened the\nscoring by picking up a pass\nfrom his fellow back row\nforward Chris Wilson, to go\nover to the corner. This was\nfairly indicative of the way\nthe back row played together in a devastating unit,\nboth in attack and defence.\nSwinnerton missed the conversion but some minutes\nlater kicked a40 yard penalty to put I.C.60 up.\nThe ruc king of the I.C. pack was really superb and\nfrom one ruc k on the C.E.M. line, John Ballard received\nthe ball to crash his way\nover. This remained the score\nat half-time.\nC.E.M. started throwing\nthe ball about somewhat\nmore in the second half and\npulled back to 9-3 with a penalty goal. However I.C. stuck to their task and\ntackled ferociously\u2014especially in the centre. Swinnerton\nkicked three more penalty\ngoals\u2014two of them monstrous kicks from around 50-60 yards; he was only just\nunlucky with several more.\nThese took all the fight out\nof C.E.M. and I.C. finished\nthe game well on top.\nThe day's honours went to\nI.C. as the better team but\nLANLEY'SM LEY for your \u2014\nBOOKS\nART MATERIALS\nPAPER BACKS\nSTATIONERY\n1 EXHIBITION ROAD,S. W.7 surely the I.C. pack with\nTerry Stephenson behind\nthem at scrum-half must present a formidable combination for any side, so Woolwich in the final had better\ntake heed.\nFree coaches will leave the\nUnion Arch at 12.30 p.m. on\nSaturday, March 7th \u2014this\nis really one day when I.C. need your support so come\nand cheer (or drink, or sing\n. . . . or do your thing!) at\nMotspur Park a fortnight\nSaturday, it'll be well worth\nwhile.\nTeam: John Wild, Keith\nDevaney (capt.), John Kelly,\nKip Conolly, Derek Marriott,\nJohn Ballard, Terry Stephenson, Andy Clark, Andy\nPowell, Ian Brill-Edwards,\nSteve Owens, George Widelski, Chris Wilson, Clive\nSwinnerton, Ifor Rhys.\nAn Action Shot from I.C.'s Gutteridge\nCup Match\nSwimming: Victories for I.C.I. C. had a comprehensive\nvictory in the U.L. U. swimming championships, winning eight out of the nine\nmen's events. The depth of\nour strength was shown by\nour having the maximum\nnumber of 2 finalists in each\nevent, and by our taking first\nand second places in four\nevents.\nThe 440 yd. freestyle was\neffortlessly won by Roy Harris with Peter McCartney\n(I.C.) second. In the 110\nyard freestyle later on the\nplacings reversed despite McCartney showing his flair for\ns portman ship, by pausing to\ncurse the starter before setting off a yard behind everyone else to found a new\nchampionship record of 59.8\nsec. Eric Thompson (I.C.) had\nthe misfortune to be pipped\nfor first place by a touch\ntwice, once in the 220\nyd. butterfly. In his third final\nin the 4 x36 yd. individual medley he again finished\nin second place behind Harris who cruised away to a new championship record. In\nthe other men's individual\nswimming event, the 110 yd.\nbackstroke, McCartney (I.C.) was neck and neck with C. Rogers (LLC), the holder,\nthroughout the race and finally was awarded the race\non the judges' decision, both\nfirst and second recording\nthe same time. Bill Abel\n(I.C.) won the men's diving\nvery effortlessly and ele-g ant ly. The I.C. team's victories in the two relay races\ninvolved quite a lot of effort\nand very little elegance but\nwere nevertheless conclusive.\nThis year's win of the College Cup\u2014the fourth in succession for I.C. \u2014was by far\nthe most crushing, due to the\noutstanding performances of\nHarris who won three events\nand was second in one, McCartney who did two personal best performances in\nwinning two events and coming second in one, and\nThompson who was very\nclosely second in three events\nand was unfortunate not to\nwin one.\nHockey 4-1 Win for I. C.W. A. in\nCup Semi-Final\nThe match started at a very fast pace and within five\nminutes, after some good\nwork by the I. C.W. A. for-wards, Lynne Beynon scored\nwith an extremely good shot.\nThis effort was repeated almost straight away and so\nwith only ten minutes gone\nI. C.W. A. led by 2-0. However, some of the impetus\nwas now lost and several\ngood chances were allowed\nto go begging. Towards the\nend of the first half slack\nmarking in the defence allowed Westfield to score\ntheir only goal of the match.\nIn fact this was the only real\nchance that Westfield had in\nthe whole match.\nIn the second half I. C.W. A. dominated the game and began to play with real assur-ance. Both wings were used\nmuch more and both were\nable to put across some very\ngood centres, which were unfortunately wasted. However,\nmidway through the second\nhalf Lynne Beynon completed her hat-trick with a well\ntaken goal, and towards the\nend of the match Chris Culshaw showed very good control when she eluded several\ndesperate tackles to complete the scoring.\nThe match was played in a very fine spirit and the stopping and hitting of the\n1.CW.A. team was of a very\nhigh standard. While the\nwhole team played well it is\nnot invidious to single out\nLynne Beynon for her hat-trick, Brenda Dilley and\nChris Culshaw, who both\nplayed extremely well on the\nwings, Mary Lewis who had\na fine game at centre-half,\nand Janet Mansfield who\ngave a very polished performance at left back.\nProvided that the team can\ngive a similar performance in\nthe final at Motspur Park on\n28th February then the Penney Cup must return to LC. Team: Jackie Buzzard;\nSue Edwards and Janet Manfield; Hilary Hutchin, Mary\nLewis and Marilyn Diggens;\nBrenda Dilley, Sue Thompson, Lynne Beynon, Mysza\nPaluch and Chris Culshaw.\nThe season is reaching an\nexciting climax (though complicated by an avalanche of\nlast minute cancellations and\nrearrangements) as three of\nthe five teams are poised to\nwin their leagues.\nThe Men'sI team is still\nunbeaten with two out of ten\nmatches to play, and must\nwin Division I of the U.L. U. League, unless both these\ngames are lost. This will return I.C. to the position of\ncontinual dominance over\nthe U.L. U. League that it\noccupied until two years ago.\nFive of the games so far have\nbeen won by the narrowest\npossible margin (i.e.54; de-Badminton\nfinitely too close for com-fort) and without the skill\nand steadiness of Stu Donald\nand George Georgiou in\nparticular, the outcome\nwould have been very different. After a shaky start, the HI team has recovered well, and\nhas now won all except their\nfirst two matches. They are\nat present top of U.L. U Division IV, and must be in with\na good chance of taking\ntheir division.\nThe mixed team, having\nthe services of three Mathematicions, has a calculable\nchance of winning the Mixed\nFirst Division, though depending on more 'ifs' and\n'and s' than bear conte mpla tion. Two matches have been\nlost, one against each of the\nother two possible winners,\nU.C and Q.M. C Providing\nthat the results of several\nmatches turn out favourably\n(and Jupiter aligns with\nMars), then we have a fair\nchance of winning on a set-count.\nThe Men's II team have\nwon two out of five matches\nplayed so far and should\nmaintain their place in the\nmiddle of Division II.\nResults\nPW LF A Men'sI8805121 Mixed 9 7 2 56 25\nLeeds Triumph in Hyde Park Relay\nLast Saturday week I.C. successfully organised their\nAnnual Hyde Park Relay. 73\nteams from universities and\ncolleges throughout Britain,\nand 7 teams from the Continent started the 6 x3 mile\ncourse.\nAt the end of the first leg,\nEdinburgh University were\nin the lead but dropped back\non legs 3 and 4 to eventually\nfinish fourth.

As a student of\nclassical statuary, i there need\nhave been no fundamental\nconflict between him and\nthe 'establishment' at that\ntime. It was after his father's death that he finished what\nhe regarded as his first major\nwork, The Man with the\nBroken Nose. He entered it\nfor exhibition at the\nAcademy of Arts who with\ncharacteristic stupidity rejected it. Rodin despised the\noutward appearance of\n'finish' and lack of emotional\ndepth that the Academicians\nseemed to hold so dear. But\nas a consolation for his bad\nreception he met a woman\nWho believed in him, Marie\nRose Beuret, who became\nbis mistress and gave him a son in 1866.\nIn 1876 after his visit to\nItaly, Rodin's art changed\nforever, he had captured\nMichelangelo's feeling for\nthe eternal, which he fused\ninto his own work. In 1881\nRodin was engaged on the\nworking of a massive collection of sculptures called\n'The Gates of Hell'. The\nphotograph of Adam shown\nhere was to be included in\nthis work, however, sufficient funds were not available for its completion. (A statue of Eve was also\ndoomed to remain unfinished\nsince the model became\npregnant and vanished with\nher Russian seducer) in the\nphotograph of Adam it is\neasy to see the influence of\nMichelangelo, the pointed\nfinger is from the fresco,\nCreation of Adam, in the\nSistine Chapel, and the bent\nright leg, the inclination of\nthe head derive from the\ndead Christ in Michelangelo's Pieta at Florence.\nIn London\nIn the winter of 1881\nRodin journeyed to London\nto learn dry point technique\nat the Slade School of Fine\nArt. Rodin's popularity was\nnow growing, he began to\nbecome fashionable in Parisian high society. The\nnext year Rodin met one of\nthe prime passions of his fife\nthe sculptress, Camille\nClaudel, who became his\nstudent, mistress and model.\nShe was the model for his\nsculpture shown, called\nTriumphant Youth. Much of\nthe eroticism of Rodin's work at this period was due\nto Camille Claudel's in-flue nce.A marble of The\nKiss was completed and\npromptly hidden away\nbecause of its 'possible\neffect on public morals'.\nIn the spring of 1889\nRodin held a joint exhibition with Claude Monet, the\nsame year that he received a commission for the monument to Victor Hugo. In the\nyears up to 1898 Rodin completed the Burghers of Calais\nand what some consider to\nbe his greatest work, the\nMonument to Balzac. If\nyou look at the photograph\nof the 'Balzac' shown you\nwill notice that it is not\nquite lifelike. Rodin wanted\nto show the inner, eternal\nman, not the superficial\nmannerisms and features.\nHowever the Salon again\nacted characteristically and\nrejected Rodin's 'Balzac'\nbecause, in their opinion, it\nwas unfinished. This disappointed Rodin cruelly\nsince he had lived, slept and\ndreamed Balzac since he\nhad started the commission.\nAnother blow to his peace\nof mind came with his break\nwith Camille Claudel.\nAlthough he had two triumphant tours of Holland and\nEngland in the years leading to 1905, he never quite\nrecovered from this double\nblow.\nAffair\nIn the year 1905 Rodin\nbegan a disastrous association with a peculiar woman,\nthe Duchesse de Cloiseul\nnicknamed by her contemporaries, the 'muse'. This\nlove affair resulted in the\nestrangement of many of\nRodin's dearest friends.\nDespite the unhappiness and\nsuffering in Rodin's life at\nthis time he managed to\nmake several lively and expressive busts of t ne 'Muse'.\nWhen modelling her she lay\ndown on her back, head\nturned towards the light, her\nneck firmly between his\nknees, while he modelled\nwith his thumb touching\nfirst her flesh then with his\nthumb still warm modelled\nthe part he had just touched.\nRodin received full recognition in his own lifetime, a fate not shared by many of\nhis contemporaries. Rodin\nwas not to enjoy his success\nfor long, for on the 14th February 1912 Rose Beuret,\nnow Madame Rodin, died.\nRodin's spirit was finally\nbroken. In November of the\nsame year he contracted\npneumonia and died. He\nwas buried beside Rose with\nThe Thinker as a headstone.\nA headstone that so typified\nthe man, Rodin.\nJames Pinfold\nRonin's \"Adam\" revealing Michelangelo'sj influence\nTr in ii \u2022\nIn \"Castle Keep\", Peter Falk is Sgt.

ABROAD\nMany students want to\ntravel, especially abroad, but\nwith the limited finances at\ntheir disposal, the costs involved become prohibitive.\nWith suppressed dreams of\nsun-drenched beaches and\nwide-open spaces, they are\nforced to spend their summers under the cold rain-laden skies of Britain. I would like to suggest extensive source of holidays at\nhome and abroad that, from\nwhat I can make out, is\nvirtually untapped or is just\nnot known about by many\nin this country. This is the\nfield of work camping. Before saying any more, it\nis essential to define just\nwhat one means by a work-camp and the purpose of it.\nTo some it conjures up ideas\nof barbed wire and r niz zen huts (Silwood?), to others,\nvisions of rubbing sticks together under the beady eye\nof a buxom guide mistress.\nWorkcamping began to grow\non an international scale\nshortly after the war. Its\nmain purpose is to bring\nyoung people together in an\ninformal community to perform useful tasks and to\nacquire understanding\nthrough the common bond\nof manual and other work.\nThe type of work can vary\nenormously, from the social\nservice side of redecorating\nold folks homes or working\nin institutions, to forestry,\nbuilding or fruit-picking.\nThe job on hand is the\nprimary consideration, but\nthe fringe benefits are end-less, and the social side is\nan important and amusing\nside of work camp life. A pre-requisite for work camp ing is to be active and\nhealthy, and so sports\nfeature strongly for those\nwho want them. Entertaining tends to be on a contrib uti ve basis, and because of\nthe diverse nationalities\npresent, apparently mundane\nthings become of interest, be\nit dispelling rumours of free\nlove on the London Underground, or enumerating the\nnumber of feet on a Royal\nCorgi. Someone always has a guitar, and sing-songs are\nfrequent, with involvement\nformed by the necessity to\nproduce a national song now\n\u2022 and again \u2022\u2014 Rugby songs\ncan be risky, as the common\nlanguage is English, so\nyou'd have a lot of explaining to do.\nAccommodation tends to\nbe spartan, so if you can't live without your Dunlopillo\nmattress, maybe this is not\nthe life for you. The financial angle is of great importance, and is such that board\nand lodgings are provided\nfree at all camps, and at\nsome, pocket money or\nminimal wages are paid. Free\ntravel is provided in the\ndistrict, and if the camp is\nabroad, travel may be free\nor at worst substantial concessions may be made.\nOverall, one must expect to\nsu end a certain amount, but\nconsiderably less than sitting\non your backside at home.\nSomething about my own\nexperience of work camps might not come amiss\u2014then\nat least I will not be accused\nof conning unfortunates into\ndastardly labour camps in\nthe wilds of nowhere.\nIn the summer of 68,\nthrough U.N.A., I got on to\na two week camp in the\nLebanon. Applying rather\nlate, I had rather little\nchoice of the company I wanted, but it was the\nMiddle East and that was\ngood enough. I worked for\nthe first month of the vac to\nafford the fare which was \u00a350\nreturn Paris-Beirut, cheap\nfor the distance and one\nthird of the regular fare.\nEverything was laid on, the\ncamp being on the site of a If you are at all interested with the idea of work camps, an organisation which acts\nas coordinator is the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges, 91 Victoria\nStreet, SW1. They issue a booklet entitled \"Working Holidays Abroad\", and will help\nyou contact the bodies for long term work abroad, such as V. S.O.,U.N. A.,D.V. S., Concordia etc.\ncoL CuT T Spring is once more in the air, and the mists that in the past months\nhave obscured the view from my tower are receding.\nNow that I am able to look down unhindered upon Imperial College,\nmy amazed eyes are met with an awesome sight: the almost totally\nexposed \" body politic \" of I.C. Administration.\nFor more years than I care to remember, that deceitful hour i, Admin,\nperformed a\" Dance of the Seven Veils \" before the mesmerized students,\ntechnicians, and teaching staff of the College. She teased and tant ali sed them with suggestive movements of these veils of bureaucracy, without\never actually revealing a single square inch of herself.\nHer audience, craning to catch a furtive glimpse, speculated upon her\nhidden charms and became desirous of only one thing: \" participation \".\nThey waited expectantly for this desire to be fulfilled, and were rewarded\nwith whispered promises. The dance proceeded, the promises continued,\nbut the veils stubbornly remained \u2014 admin was playing had to get As\ntime passed, the baffled audience became more and more impatient \u2014\nsuggestions became requests, requests became demands. They clam our ed for participation, and even threatened the most ungentlemanly behaviour.\nAnd so the first veil was cast aside and, amid cries of \"more, more\"\ndoubling and re-doubling, the rest were torn away one by one.\nNow the Board of Studies, for a little while yet, clutches the one\nremaining veil, behind which Admin attempts to hide herself from the\ncold gaze of those she led on for so long. For she is revealed at last as\nnothing but an ageing whore. Her clients are industry, her pimp the D.E.S. Needless to say, she is very simple-minded, having a childish conservative\noutlook on life and believing in a\" Great Architect of the Universe\"\n(who is presumably not a graduate of the A. A.). So, if the student body was to seek my advice, I would say this:\u2014\nDo not participate. Withdraw representation (you never know what you\nmight catch). With the teaching staff and technicians set up a new virgin\nstructure to oppose the administration. A word of warning though \u2014\nbeware the jealousy of the admin, whore. She will try to cripple her rival\neven before conception. So refuse any token gift-wrapped concessions \u2014\nthey might contain \" thalidomide \". And above all remember that you have\nnothing to lose but your chains.\nYours in springtime hope,\nColcutt.\nRoman temple up in the hills\namong the superb scenery.\nThe work entailed some\nscratching around on the dig\nevery morning, which was\nhardly arduous, with the\nrest of the day to ourselves.\nThis camp was very good in\nthat we had a well balanced\ncommunity, consisting of\nDutch, Germans, English,\nCzechs, Swiss, a Norwegian,\nsome Lebanese and loads of\nFrench girls. We had a week\ntouring the country in a beaten up bus, having to pay\nfor our food only. This\nwas an exceptional camp, in\nthat so much was free,\nand resulted from the\nLebanese government's desire\nto nurture international good-will, apart from their natural\ngenerosity \u2014 not surprising\nwith Israel on their southern\nborder. Having got out\nthere so cheaply, I then\nbummed on to Egypt (in-c ident ally a country full of\nfascination, and with such a low standard of living that\nsurvival is easy) via the deck\nof a Greek boat and Cyprus,\nbut that's another story.\nKeep this date clear to hear about careers for Graduates\n- men and women- in the RoyalAirForce\n\" To find out what a job is like, talk to someone who is doing it.\" This is perhaps the main reason why you' ll be interested to meet the RAF' s University Liaison Officer.

The College at that\ntime was poorly equipped\nand understaffed as a result\nof the war and W. J. embarked on a reconstruction programme which provided full\nscope for his organisational\nabilities and his life-long devotion to bridging the gap\nbetween Unversities and Industry. Many features of the\npresent undergraduate course\nwere introduced during this\nperiod and are now accepted\nas essential. They include individual final-year projects,\nemphasis on the importance\nof the presentation of technical information and student\ncolloquia and have the common aim of providing students not just with a factual\nknowledge of electrical engineering but with an appreciation of the practical problems met by electrical eng in* ki:. Lord Jackson of Burnley\ne ers. W. J. consistently argued\nfor the recognition of technology as an activity distinct\nfrom science but was equally\naware of the importance of a scientific foundation for\nengineering studies. He\nstrengthened the undergraduate course by including more\nbasic theory and in part icu lar, his early interest in\nchemistry was reflected by\nthe stress which he placed\non the need for studying the\nproperties of materials.\nBy 1953, the department\nwas in a flourishing state\nwith a staff well able to adapt courses to the rapidly\nchanging nature of electrical\nengineering\u2014for example the\ndepartment was the first in\nthis country to include transistors as an undergraduate\nsubject. The same staff, with\ncontinuous backing and encouragement from W. J. established several major research groups which continue\ntheir contribution to the advancement of electrical engineering\u2014a tribute to his\nvision in selecting areas of\ndevelopment and in picking\nthe men to achieve results.\nIn 1953 it appeared unlikely\nthat the size of the College\nwould increase and W. J. \u2014\npossibly believing that he had\nmade his contribution to the\nCollege\u2014accepted an invitation to become Director of\nResearch and Education for\nA.E.I.( Manchester), a company perhaps better known\nby its previous name Metropolitan-Vickers, and one with\nwhich he had had very close\nconnections. This post enabled him to tackle his prime\ninterest of welding together\neducational and industrial\nactivities from the industrial\nside and the cogency of his\narguments for such integration led to his becoming increasingly involved in national policies relating to the em-ploy ment, education and\ntraining of technological and\nscientific manpower.\nHis connection with the\nCollege remained a close one\nand he returned, in 1961,\nagain as Head of the Electrical Engineering Department, to participate in a major expansion involving\nthe move to the present Electrical Engineering build-ing. Once more, he took the\nopportunity to broaden the\neducational pattern of the\nundergraduate course, for example by the provision of a language laboratory and aT.V. studio for student use.\nHis concern with technology\npolicy on a national scale\nnaturally led him to devote\nhis attention to College,\nrather than purely Departmental problems, and he\nplayed a major part in the\nintroduction of the inter-de-part mental M. Sc. course in\nMaterials Science and in the\nformation of the Centre for\nComputing And Automation. From 1967, as ProRector, he worked unceasingly to ensure that Imperial\nCollege maintains its present\nplace as a leader in Scientific and Technological Education by adapting its policies to meet changing situations and by continuing its\ntradition of pioneering new\neducational methods. Two\nmatters to which he gave\nparticular attention were diversification of courses and\nthe danger that over-e mph a sis of the departmental structure should exclude desirable\nacademic developments.\nThere are many activities\nin the College by which\nLord Jackson will be remembered. Those of us who had\nthe good fortune to work\nclosely with him will also remember how much we have\nlearned by observing him in\naction. The most important\nthings one learns\u2014as Lord\nJackson himself frequently\nrecalled\u2014are from the people\none works with. In my case,\nI am grateful to have learned from him of the need for\na balance bet wen my desire\nfor the pursuit of private research and the claims of\nwider responsibilities.\nWe are indebted to Professor Brown for writing this\nobituary for Felix.\nC. and G.

Nevertheless, all the ninety-odd teams taking part clocked up faster\naverage times than ever before, and C.&G. did 500 laps!\nFor the last four years R.C.S. have always won one or both\nof the categories. Last year C.&G. were blighted by a broken\ncrankshaft on one vehicle and a collapsed frame on the\nother.\nGardens\nAglow\nIn the early hours of\nThursday last week, the residents of Prince's Gardens\nwere treated to the thrilling\nsight of London's Fire Brigade in action. These intrepid anti-pyro tech nist s arrived\nin force (4 appliances, lights\nflashing, sirens clanging)\naccompanied by 3 fuzz-mobiles and a Black Maria,\nto find a section of road\nabout 6 foot by 1, blazing\naway with flames reaching\nthe incredible height of 6\ninches. 3 fire-appliances, 2\nfuzz-mobiles and the Black\nMaria left, while the remaining fire-engine ran out a hose\nand waited for the Gas\nBoard.\nA resident of Garden Hall,\nover-come perhaps with\ncommunity spirit, attempted\nto put out the fire on his\nown, with a bucket of water\nfrom his window; unfortunately, he missed by some 25\nyards, and a group of about\nhalf a dozen rubber-necker s had occasion to regret his\ngood intentions.\nAnother group of bystanders offered to apply their\nused beer to the flames, and\nhence extinguish them; but\nthis was met with nothing\nmore than a crude rejoinder\nfrom the friendly driver of a departing fuzz-mobile.\nAfter about an hour, the\nGas Board arrived, turned\noff the gas, and everyone\nwent home.\nWhither\nR.C.S.? The RCS Union meeting\nheld on Tuesday, 17th February in Physics lecture\ntheatre 3 must rank as one\nof the greatest ever demonstrations of apathy in the\nlong history of RCS.

    "content": "STATEMENT FROM I.C. UNION COUMCIL SPECIAL MEETING, MONDAY FEBRUARY 23\nREPRESENTATION - ICRC - REFECTORY COMMITTEE REFORM - JURGO - ACTION\nI.C.U, Council recognises the urgency and importance of I.C.U. policies on these matters especially within the general context of building a participatory academic community.\nCouncil draws attention to the Rector's Statement of December 4 th that he\nis keen ' to foster closer contact of all members of the College' and\nregretfully notes the Colleges intransigence on these issues.1. Representation Student representation on the Board of Studies was first discussed In June 1969 where it was rejected. Despite frequent requests the Board of Studies did notre discuss it until February18 th,1970. Their February18 th' decision to decide' is not enough - but might be a step forward. Sixteen extra non professorial staff who will be ( approximately) department ally based are being elected for the special end of term ( or early vacation) Board of Studies decision making. Hence, I.C.U. Council asks that5 student observers(4 Academic Officers and President) be allowed to attend the special Board of Studies meeting. Their purpose being to represent, explain and discuss, Union policy, infrastructure and departmental matters. The students to be\npresent for the whole duration of the discussion on representation and\nallied topics.2. Imperial College Representative Council The I.C.R.C. was set up at the Initiation~ of~ l7 c7~U^in October,1969. On January30 th,1970, the Rector rebuffed the ICRC. His refusal to meet or recognise the representatives of the ICRC who represent the vast majority of the College community is quite unacceptable to I.C. Union since it is contrary to the spirit of cooperation and participation which I.C, Union is fostering. Despite repeated requests no offer of recognition has been received. Council feels that the Rector should accord great and real importance to the I.C.R.C.. Hence, Council requests that the Rector report to special meetings of the ICRC matters which he is to report to the I.C. Board of Governors( The special ICRC meetings to be convened just prior to the Board of Governors Meeting) Such a process would enable representatives of the vast majority of the College community to discuss natt ers of college wide importance and hence\nensure that the Rector could gu age the feelings of the College community.\n3 . Refectory Committee Reforms\nCouncil reiterates the urgent need for refectory committee reform as\nagreed by the ICRC and ( I.C. Union) namely : -i. The Chairman of the Committee should be chosen by the members of Committee, with its Secretary as permanent member reporting to the Governing Body. ii. There should be 3 Trade Union Representatives and one Clerical Staff Representative on the Refectory Committee, Council notes the complaints made about the Chairman of the Refectory Committee in November and further draws attention to the motion of' no confidence' expressed in him by I.C. Union( on February19 th) when an\nabusive and unc on tru ct ive letter from him to I.C. Union President was\nread to the Union General Meeting. Hence, I.C, Union Council mandates its representatives on the Refectory Committee to move the removal of the Chairman, continued "

This\ntime last year a motion on direct action against the admin,\nwould have been laughed out of a Union Meeting, but not\nnow. At the last nearly-quo rate IC Union Meeting there was\nprolonged discussion between two clearly defined groups,\nwho, as usual, seem completely incapable of seeing each\nother's point of view, and it was all started by a motion that\nwe occupy level 5 of college block in protest against the\nRector's stalling over the representation issue.\nThe moderates were there, led by Keith Guy and Stu\nSimpson, and the activists, or extremists, or whatever you\nlike to call them, they were there, with Christopher, May\nand Muller impatient for action of any kind. For every time\nsomeone said that action now would ruin any chance of\ngaining effective representation on the BoSt, and effective is\nthe important word, someone else stood to say that some\nform of action was essential just to let the admin, know we\ncannot be pushed around forever.\nSimpson stated that we've only a month to wait for the\nresults of the next all-important BoSt meeting, and we're\nstill unsure what those results will be; that was true, yet\nMuller implored the meeting to \" get up and fucking well\ndo SOMETHING\", and I can understand that as well.\nThere seems to be no clear path to gaining student representation in a way which will mean more than just token\nrepresentation, a sop to keep the plebs happy.\nFor once we had representation of the BoSt at an IC\nUGM, in the form of one Professor Alexander, who talked\nabout avoiding mass hysteria and dragged up the A A affair\nagain; it was good to see someone from the staff there, of\ncourse, but present in his attitude was the eternal 'yes-of-course-you-ought-to-do-something - and-I'm all-in-favour-of-action-but,-er,-not-yet.', which is becoming depressingly\nfamiliar.\nIt was a refreshing change to see people clam our ing to\nspeak from the floor, it was depressing to see less than 300\nthere to hear them, (why were there only three others besides\nPiers Corbyn facing the meeting?). Like many others I voted\nagainst the motion more from inertia than from being swayed\neither way by the speeches from the floor. It's getting late,\nelections approach and we may soon know who we'll be\nchoosing our new executive from. Next year could see the\nwhole thing swept under the carpet if we don't get a definite\ndecision soon.\n^ % IP *H The weary subject of FELIX, what it is, how it is run,\nwhat it should be, how much it should get, how it is independent yet is financially very dependent on Union funds\nindeed, whether it should be censored or the editor controlled,\netc. etc., keeps coming back. FELLX has been accused of\nbeing run by a clique, and probably with some truth in the\naccusation, but we're willing to let anyone in on the FELIX\nclique if they come along to the press-room any Tuesday or\nThursday lunchtime to offer their services. Cliques form\nthrough too few people having to do too much work over a long period; we'll need carry-over staff to learn how to produce FELIX next term in preparation for the next academic\nyear.

Publications\nBoard, Imperial College Union, London, S.W.7. Letters to the Editor\nA VERBAL MEANDERING\nDear Sir,\nIt used to be said that if\none was not a Socialist before one was twenty-one, one\nhad no heart, while if one\nremained a Socialist after\ntwenty-one, one had no\nhead. Presumably, with\nearlier maturity as recognised by the law, the age\nof twenty-one should be replaced by eighteen; as such,\none would expect those who\narrive at a college such as\nI.C., and who presumably\nshould have rather more\n'head' than the average\ncitizen, to be much less inclined to the extreme left\npolitically than the country\nas a whole. From my own\nexperience this is in fact the\nstate of affairs.\nYet one finds that, while\nthe majority of I.C. students\nare sane and sensible mo-de rates, the affairs of I.C. Union are completely controlled by the pseudo-left ish group around the Hon.\nPiers Corbyn. I suggest that\nthis is because the Union\nMeetings consist of such a verbal meandering through\nsuch fruitless fields of naive\npseudo-political \u2014 to hell\nwith the big words \u2014 waffle,\nthat people do not consider\nit worth the earache of sitting through a debate (?!)\non a motion in order to vote\nagainst it, especially as they\nknow that whatever way the\nvote goes will affect nothing\nwhatsoever. If the Union\nconfined itself to discussing\n(sensibly) subjects which are\nof interest to the majority of\nstudents, a much greater\namount of participation in\nI.C. Union by I.C. students\nwould result, and until there\nis increased student participation in student affairs, it\nis to my mind pointless to\nask for increased student\nparticipation in academic\nand business affairs of the\nCollege.\nI would like to suggest a simple modification to Union\nrules which would to my\nmind improve the situation.\nThis is in two parts:\u2014\n(a) No subject to be debated by a Union Meeting\n(unless Council decides it is\nvery urgent) until 10% of\nthe members of I.C.U. request a debate on the sub-j ect.( b) No motion to be\npassed by a Union Meeting\nunless at least 30% of those\nentitled to vote, vote in\nfavour of the motion.\nAs an indication of the\npresent state of affairs, at the\nonly vote of any real importance \u2014 that on the\nN.U.S. \u2014 while I have been\nhere, it was decided to join\nthe N.U.S. by (my figures\nmay be slightly wrong, but\nare of the correct order)\nsomething like 204 in favour,\n196 against, i.e.5.1% to\n4.9%, 90% don't now (as-sum in g4,000I.C. students).\nYours sincerely,\nKENNETH W.HER ON. More explicit Vandalism and Dear Editor,\nAs an interested partaker in the debate on editorial\npolicy, perhaps I should make my two cents' worth more\nexplicit. My one and only concern is that the students of\nthis college be informed of what is being done on their behalf\nand in their name. I appreciate that discussion on representation and diversification is a long and boring process,\nand that its value as a news item diminishes with time. However, this does not detract from the right of IC students to\nbe informed of current developments.\nI believe that student representatives have a duty to\nreport, not only to Council, but also to the body of students\nthat elected them. If FELIX is not prepared to print these reports and communications, then some alternative channel of\npublicity must be found, the most usual one being bump h sheets.\nMany people have been critical of broadsheets, bump h sheets and suchlike, but are these people seriously contending that the Editor of FELIX be given a complete monopoly\non all publication of information? The need for publicity\nexists independently of Felix, and this need must be satisfied.\nIt must not be construed from this that I disapprove of\neditorial freedom. On the contrary, the need for an independent newspaper is as acute now as it ever was, but what\nI am saying is that there should be an official channel of\ncommunication from ICU to its members.\nConfusion arises because FELIX purports to be this\nofficial channel. By its constitution FELIX is \" the official\nnewspaper of Imperial College Union \", something which it\nclearly is not. No-one, not even the President, can tell the\nEditor what to print, and rightly so.\nI would advocate, therefore, two things. Firstly, that\nFELIX clarify its status; and secondly, the development of\nthe IC Newsheet as the official channel of communication.\nYours sincerely,\nBRIAN HAINS.\nThe Editor reserves the right to omit all or part of\nany letter or articles submitted to him. Contributors\nwho do not wish their letters to be sub-edited should\nstate so.\nThe opinions expressed in letters and signed articles\nare not necessarily those of Felix or of Imperial College Union.\nPlease limit your letters to 350 words wherever pos-sib le, copy date is one week before publication, and\nletters received after this time will not be included.\nAnti Israel Propaganda Dear Sir,\nThis week, the Jewish Society held an exhibition in\nMech. Eng. concourse on anti-semitism in the Soviet Union.\nThe exhibition gave information about certain individuals\nwho had been subjected to some form of persecution there,\nand advertised a demonstration against this discrimination.\nOn Monday, Janet in the Union Office had a 'phone\ncall asking whether permission had been obtained for the\ndisplay of this exhibition. She replied that it had. On Wednesday, part of the exhibition was ripped down, and\nsimultaneously anti-Israel propaganda appeared on several\nnoticeboards \u2014 propaganda totally unrelated to the question of Soviet Jewry.\nIt illustrates a very sad state of affairs in the college,\nwhen one cannot put up an exhibition and be sure that it\nwill stay up. The mentality of the person responsible is\nclearly shown by this inane action, in that he is incapable\nof expressing criticism in any other way than by ripping\ndown posters. Freedom of speech in a university is seriously\nimpaired when this hooliganism continues. It is, after all,\nnot difficult to put up an exhibition or to write a letter to\nFELIX expressing a point of view. I trust that when the\nsociety holds another exhibition in a few weeks time, these\nvandals will see fit to allow the students of the college to\nmake up their own minds.\nYours sincerely,\nHAROLD MARSH BAUM( Chairman, Jewish Society)\nAn ony mice Sir,\nI have been most distressed by the letter you printed\nfrom the three an ony mice. It is their attitude, shared by\ncountless female humans in the past, which caused successively the fall of Atlanti, the collapse of the Roman Empire\nin the West, the disintegration of the Holy Roman Empire,\nthe death of the Aztec race, and the disruption of the\nBritish Empire.

This was\nreinforced by seeing him at the Purcell\nroom a few weeks ago in his first solo\nconcert, and by listening to this his\nthird record.\nHis melodies have instantaneous and\nlasting impact. 'Factory Girl' is the most\nobvious example. The song itself is\nabout the monotonous life of a factory\ngirl and yet the tune gives the impression\nthat she still finds pleasure in life. The\nsame with 'Clown' who seems to enjoy\nliving two lives and not knowing which\nis real.\n'I 've Thought About It' is one of the\nmost serious numbers and Ralph makes\nforthright statements about the mess the\nworld is in without sounding resentful at all. He is one of the people whose\nmusic is in if u en ced by his life of playing\non street corners in Europe and \"Father\nForgive Them\" is one such item, while\n\"Blues In More Than Twelve Bars\",\na \"ragtime and smiles\" number, is\nanother.\nSwitching to piano on \" All Things\nChange\" he claims that the fairy on\nthe Christmas tree is the only thing\nthat doesn't change, and finally he\nquestions the insanity of being sane in\n\"Michael In The Garden\", a song about\na\" nut case\" enclosed in his own happy\nworld, being observed and scorned by\n\"well-knowing\" people.\nTo quote Joni Mitchell, Ralph has\n\"looked at life from both sides now\",\nbut yet he \"really don't know life at\nall\", and nor do any of us.\nKEVIN AYERS\n\"A JOY OF A TOY\"\nSHVL 763\nAlthough this record has been released quite a while, I only discovered\nit last week and was so impressed with\nit that I decided to include it. Kevin\nis the former bass player with Soft\nMachine (who are now getting the\nrecognition deserved), and all the songs\non this album are written by him and\nproduced by Peter Jenner. Soft Machine\nin fact back him on 'Song For Insane\nTimes', but on most tracks he is helped\non piano by David Bedford, a classical\ncomposer. Several of the tracks take\nsome getting used to \u2014 for instance\n'Oleh Oleh Bandu Bandong', on which\nhe employs two Scots girls to sing in\nMalay. As regards the lyrics, I tend\nto compare Kevin to Pete Brown, but\non all tracks the instrumental arrangements are the striking feature. They\nemploy the use of cello, piano, piccolo,\nkazoo, four types of guitar as well as\nstring and electric bass at various stages.\nI fear that this has been very under\npublicised and the originality of the\ntunes neglected. Kevin's voice is odd,\nbut suits his songs, and I think you\nshould at least hear it if nothing else.\nSIMON & GARFUNKEL\n\"BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED\nWATER\" CBS 63699\nFor me, Paul Simon has indented a lasting impression in my mind. His songs\nare deeply personal and \"Bookends\"\nfeatured strongly in this. Somehow I couldn't help but feel that I knew Cathy\nof \"Cathy's Song\" as well as I know\nmy own sister. But I find this latest\nrecord from Simon and Garfunkel very\ndisappointing indeed. There are good\ntracks \u2014 \"The Boxer\" rates very highly\nand both \"Bridge Over Troubled\nWater\" and \"The Only Living Boy In\nNew York\" are of the outstanding\nSimon calibre. But then \"Baby Driver\"\nand \"Why Don't You Write Me\". Given\nthis record without a label I would have\nsaid it was unmistakably the Beach\nBoys. And \"Cecelia\". This isn'ta Paul\nSimon love song, although \"Song For\nThe Asking\" is. The record is very well\nproduced and I feel that this is what\nhe has probably turned his hand to and\nthus neglected his songwriting. I sum\nup my feelings by saying that I live in\nanticipation of better things to come.\nPHIL TAYLOR\nRalph McTell\nPIECEPIERSPIECEPIERSPIECEPIERSPIECEPIERSPIECEP\nI.C. is now in ferment. We\nare strengthening Union policies to make sure that they\nwill be really effective\nwhen (!) implemented by the\nCollege. We are pressing\nhard, and taking limited\naction too, to get them implemented (see report of\nMonday's Special I.C. Council meeting\u2014Felicity). Elections are upon us. Some Professors and staff are taking\nthis opportunity to persuade\nstudents of certain things.\nMany members of the College are dismayed by the\nA. A./ I.C. merger break-down. The Trade Unions\n(I. C.A.S.T. M.S. etc.) are in\nstrong disagreement with the\nAdministration\u2014but making\nsome headway under pre s sure/threat. Their demands\nwill come to a head in early\nMarch.\nThe three major items we\nare pressing for right now\nare (1) to persuade the Rector to recognise and talk\nwith the I.C.R.C( students\nand technicians, etc). (2) reform of the Refectory Committee (making the chairman\nelected by the committee and\nincreasing trade union and\nclerical workers' represent a tion). (3) representation on\nBoard of Studies and committees of Board of Studies,\nand presence at the B.O. S.T. decision meeting.\nIt is important that representation is large enough for\nus to have an effective voice,\nand important that it involves discussions at the\nDepartmental level\u2014so it involves you! Use your Departmental reps! Help organise a representative structure in\nevery Department.\nDIRECT ACTION\nOver the past 1\\ terms\nsome of the Union policy\nachievements with the administration are as follows:\n1 One representative on the\nAA/IC merger committee\n2 Money for sabbatical year\nfor president\n3 Money for NUS\n4 Diversification discussion\n5 Senior common room survey\n6 Improvement of Southside\nrefectory\n7 Representation on the Development committee\n8 The BoS \" decision to\ndecide \"\nDirect action or threat of\ndirect action were not really\ninvolved in 2 or 3 but they\nwere involved in 1, 6 and 8\nand probably to some extent\nin the others. The moratorium of course achieved a lot\nin strengthening Nus's hand\nin negotiations and press\npublicity for our policies to\ninfluence and embarrass\npowerful people. (Most recent press coverage is in the\nArchitectural Journal and in\nthe Kensington News). Direct\naction has worked in other\ncolleges (people who don't want us to use direct action\nwill probably deny it has had\nany effect). I see the usefulness of action to achieve\npolicies as:\n1 To embarrass authorities\n(in press publicity)\n2 To hurt authorities (like\nindustrial power)\n3 To show our strength\n4 To increase awareness (my\nelection platform)\nThe fact that an occupation was discussed by ICU\nlast Thursday is I think very\nsignificant, by March 5 our\nposition will have crystal is ed so that further discussion of\naction will be more realistic.\nImaginative ideas are coming\nin (see Council report in Felicity) . . . but bring more!\nIn the last FELIX I said,\n\"Imperial College seems to\nbe arrogant and inflexible,\nincapable of understanding\nother ideas or recognising the\nvalidity of different concepts of academic organ is a tion.\"\nThis is still true but the\nferment is on.

Come to the U GM on March 5\u2014CHANGE IC.\nContinued from Page 3\nsent to the decay of Western civilisation.\nI feel that it is imperative that this trend be halted im-mediate ly. It is precisely because the top 2\\% of mankind are honourable, decent, well meaning, etc. that they\nare shy, or at any rate are not brash or extrovert. What has\nhappened everywhere in the past is that the lower intelligence\nof the equivalents of 'Dustmen, Navvies, Dockyardies and\nI.C. Maintenance Men' is perpetuated as they have attracted\nfemales for mating purposes, while the men of higher\nintelligence are less prepossessing, with the result that however\nintelligent a race (nation) may be to begin with, it gradually\nbecomes more stupid (and the females even more ugly),\nand this is entirely due to the mating habits of the females.\nAs I see it, the only way for. this 'Apple Rot' to be\naverted is for the female to take on the 'search and find'\npart of the mating operation. The female should try to find\nmale friends among her fellow students, and not wait to be\napproached by the more extroverted of the males.\nThe an ony mice obviously consider themselves grade\n1 prizes \u2014 if so, they should choose, and would be unlikely\nto be rebuffed.\nIn conclusion, Paris issues a challenge. If anyone can\nproduce enough females of a high enough standard to make\njudging worth-while, and publishes their photographs, the\nwinner will receive a golden apple, with subsidiary prizes\nfor runners-up. This competition is open until the 10th June\n1970. PARIS.\nP.S. Any female wishing to enter the competition may obtain\na diet sheet by enquiring from Paris (under P in Union\nLetter-Rack).\nIn the Servants' Quarters Dear Sir\nLes Ebdon's article was, as we have a right to expect,\nerudite and provocative. He raises many of the problems\nassociated with student newspapers, but without exploring\nother areas of conflict or carrying through some of the issues\nhe does raise to their logical conclusions.\nAnother problem of great importance is the old chestnut\nof 'the freedom of the press'. Surely no-one would dispute\nthat the 'freedom of the individual' must always override the\n'freedom of the press' (whatever those phrases may mean).\nIf, as Les says, \"Us Union types belong in the servants'\nquarters rather than in the throne room . . . \" then I contend\nthat this is no less true of FELIX.\nIn moving on to discuss the 'quality' and 'ideals' of a newspaper we come to the real meat of my criticisms of\nFELIX. As Les so perceptively says, \"There is something . . . .\nabout the standard of a college which can be told by the\nvirility of its newspaper.\" Quite, but Les then moves on to\noutline two facets of the ideal newspaper: the discovery of\na little literary talent, and the deflation of the ego of some\nswelling Union official. Come off it; surely we can aim higher\nthan an (occasionally) well written News of the World.\nThe last ingredient of Les' recipe for a well-done FELIX is that it should be a 'well produced, informed, independant\nnewspaper' Precisely, but to that list of adjectives I should\nlike to add a few: responsible, serious where necessary,\ncommitted, intelligent.\nAny growth in critical awareness in the student body\nover the last year has not come about primarily as a result\nof the efforts of FELIX. Indeed, coincident with a remarkable\nincrease in the seriousness, importance and level of sophistication of Union policies has come a lowering of the level of\ndebate in FELIX. It is, happily, showing signs of picking up,\nbut still has far to go. Please, FELIX, show that you are willing to treat serious matters seriously (diversification, representation, Vice-chancellors report, etc.). Show that you are\ncapable of arguing out these matters intelligently, logically,\nand clearly, even if your conclusions differ from 'Union\nPolicy'. Only then can you fully realise your potential: to\ninform every student, to commit yourself to the issues, and,\nhaving gained the respect of the readers, to influence the\noutcome of these issues.\nYours sincerely,\nJOHN GOODMAN.

It\nProgresses from personal conflict as in Who's Afraid of\nVirginia Woolf to a more abstract form of theatre. Tiny\nAlice is a heiress of untold fortune who wishes to donate a portion to the Church. This involves un for seen consequences,\nthe development of which forms this mystic play.\nCome As You Are by John Mortimer\nFour short sex comedies situated in various districts of\nLondon. The stage production is clever and the sets are very\nexotic, but the play lets have very Utile to say. Of the four,\nChristmas Eve at the home of a Bermondsey publican and\nscene set in a once famous actress's Marble Arch flat. The\nacting was good, Celia Bannerman coping extremely well\nwith her difficult parts, however Glynis Johns was not up to\nher usual standard.\nIt's A2ft.6 in. Above The Ground World by Kevin Laffan\nSet in Liverpool, this play is based on the Roman Catholic\nv. contraception conflict. On the whole the acting is fair. The\nperformances of Antony Webb and Prunella Scales stand out\nin this comedy with serious aspects.\nLUNCHTIME THEATRE\nAT THE GREEN BANANA\nThe Ambiance Lunchtime\nTheatre Club, ex-Queens-way in Bayswater last week\nopened up a new season of\nplays at the Green Banana\nRestaurant off Tottenham\nCourt Road. The opening\nwork of the season is \"How\nare your handles\", three\nhumourous sketches from\nEnglish class life by N.F. Simpson best known for his\n\"With a Resounding Tinkle\"\nand \"The Hole\".\nThe tide of the sketches\ncomes from the first in\nwhich an unnamed, unknown man comes in and\nquestions the housewife\nabout the handles in her\nhome. \"Do they feel good?\nAre they aesthetically pleas-ing? Is she satisfied with\nthem? Where did they come\nfrom? \"\nThe housewife concludes\nthat she is satisfied with them,\nas with the walls, windows,\nshelves, the whole house in\nfact. No, she had nothing to\ndo with putting them there\nPORCI LE but she's very satisfied with\nthem . . .\nThe other two sketches are\nabout equally inane (yet\nequally possible?) situations\none involving an artist who\nis away growing the be mp with which to weave his canvas (so that he can keep\ncomplete control of his\npainting) the other a dialogue between husband and\nwife when the husband returns home at 3 in the morning and claims to nave spent\nthe evening deciphering\ntombstone inscriptions.\nIt all makes for an enjoyable lunchtime and is certainly better theatre than\nyou'll find at Union meet-in gs. It's also cheap \u2014 5/-student membership and 2/6\nentrance, and there is an interesting programme including the premier of Samuel\nBeckett's \"Three Dialogues\nwith Georges Duthuit\" next\nmonth,\nMIKE MULLER\nI.

A wild eyed figure approaches,\ncaptures the butterfly, and\neats it.
