One month before opening night, it was learnt that the\npermission could not be granted, for an\namateur company to produce the initially planned play \"Liiard on the Rook\".\naaa- always meant a great deal\nmore than merely story telling with\nactions. It \"Without the Prinee\" by\nPhilip King is or ever has been o all ed drama, then I must certainly start to\nrevise my ideas.

    "content": "FELIX\n\"What in This Thing Called 3wi \u00bbg? \u00bb\nOf all the types of music, good and\nbad, which are appreciated throughout\ntUb College and outside, Swing Is\ne csi par at iv ely neglected. When one takes\nthe trouble to consider the popularity\nof ola a sio al and popular dance music,\nthe mst\u00abhe*iof swing is apt to be ignored. The popular misconception is\nthat music falls into one of two categories, either ola a sio al music or\nmodern music. Swing, however, must not\nbe confused with jazz or dan oe music,\nfrom which it is quite different. the\nq aest ion, \"How and when did Swing\ndevelop from the other forms of music?\"\nBas often arisen and the answer is quite\nsimple. We have all heard how black\nSambo took his music of Africa with him\nto slavery in America, how through the\nyears he managed to adapt his native\nray tamm to-various instruments such as\nthe clarinet, trumpet, trombone and\npiano, and how his an si ott a ally burst\ninto the world in the 1920*a. Swing\nand dan oe music later awol ved from Jan but all three are all quite distinct.\nAfter a bre if popularity of about ten\nyears, the masters of jazz were swept\nfrom the scene by the new group on*\nmusicians, the Swingsters. These\ngentlemen played a more dignified type\nof j az s, which had been specially\narranged for their large bands which\nusually consisted of about fifteen\nplayers. Whereas the j as s bands were\nmade up of about six men who each gave\na solo performance in front oS the sand,\nduring the course of the number, the\nSwingstera relied on only one or two\nsolo instrumentalists.\nOne of the chief reasons for the\nwaning popularity of j as s, waa that it galled for a tremendous amount of ..stamina\nfin the part of the mu a iai an s and a great\ndeal, of energy from the dancers. Thus\nSwing when it first appeared in 1930 waa\nthe result of experiments in j as s made\nby the dancers and musicians who did not\nwish to exert themselves quite so much,\nbut who still wanted to extract the Utmost pleasure from their music. The\nold carefree spirit of j a a i still continued in its young son Swing and\nj as s slowly began to disappear from tha\ndance hall of Britain and the, U.S.A. a a jt mc the original Swing orchestra* were\nthose of Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw, u one Krupa, Charlie Barnett, Lionel Hampton\nand the greatest of them all, Benny\nGoodman. Slowly but surely the\nvocalists of these bands began to drift\naway and as a result, Swing developed\ninto an instrumental type of music.\nThe vocalists, however, managed to join\nup with bands which were willing to play\nthe type of music which these vocalists\nsuited. Thus was formed the type of\nmusic which is extremely popular.to-day,\nnone other than o heap commercial rubbish,\nSihoe 1936, when this break took\nplace Swing has been presented at\nconcerts and many records made, although\nSwing is no longer heard in dan oe halls,\nmany of the old masters of Swing are\nstill with us and several new band* have\nappeared, who try and on the whole\nsucceed in playing in the style '-of their\nforerunners. Whilst listening to\nconcerts and records of Swing the tan-demo* t \u00bb Bom to ait back and enjoy each\nnote played, but our forerunners of the\nearly 30'a obtained just as much\npleasure from Swing from dancing to it. Little Swing, however, ia^ composed to-day, the bands relying on'new arran g ment of early favourites. Woody\nBarman and Charlie Barnett have attained\ngreat popularity in this way by their\nskillful renderings of \"Oldies\" as they\nare o all od. Among the new Swing musicians of\nthe day who have their own bands, we '\nhave Ray Antony, a splendid trumpet\nplayer who graduated from Columbia\nUniversity in 1947 and who is enjoying\na great deal of popularity on both sides\non the Atlantic, chiefly as area ul t of\nhis first record,*\"Mr. Antony's Boogie\".\nBilly May plays in the style of the late\nGlenn Miller (tragically killed in .\nactive service) and he almost succeeds\nin capturing the charm of his famous\npredecessor, although his saxophones-effect in the background are very poor-Buddy Morrow, yet another American, has\nhis own natural style and his most famous recording, \"Night Train\", is a basic\nrecord for any fan who is thinking of\nstarting a Swing collection. Early\nrecords pf English trumpeter\" Kenny\nBaker provide good examples of this\nkind of music.\nFinally, I would like to mention my\nown favourite instrumentalist, Benny\nGoodman, who, next to Frederick Thurston,\nthe serious musician, is the best\nclarinet player in the world. Not a great deal is heard of Benny Goodman\nthese days, but he has recently made a number of good records and has proved,\nthat he is as good as he ever was.\nAlso in circulation at the moment is a long playing record of an all star band,\nled by Benny Goodman when Swing was in\nits heyday in 1937. I refer of course\nto the Carnegie Hall o ono ert. I would\nsay that this.is the finest collection\nof numbers ever to be recorded on one\ndisc.\nL.A.K.. At this time it is usual to look\nback over the old year, and to recall\nthe past events. For j az s,1959, was .\na very full and exciting year.\nThe British Jazz fan has \"rawer had\nit so good.\" The t raff io of musicians,\nacross the pond seemed almost continuous,\nFor the majority, the trip was well jus-tif i ed, but for some the results were\ndisappointing. It is worth noting\n(at least I hope that promoters will o on a ider it worth noting) that the\nleast satisfactory were the package\nshows, where a variety of groups were\nthrown together, each told strictly *\nthat they could have twenty minutes on\nthe stand, and were expected to produce\ngood jazz.\nBut first let us think of the\nbetter things of 1959. The perennial\nCount Basic (he seem* to be popping up\nhare with annual regularity) treated us\nto many fine displays of solid, wringing\njazz. Duke Ellington proved that he has\nthe greatest band in the world.\nLouis Armstrong was truly magnificent,\ntat I find it hard to rave over his\nfellow All Stars. The MJQ left me\n(and thousands of others) almost s pea on las a with excitement. .It was heartwarming to see two of our own musicians fitting in so perfectly; Joe\nHarriot's \"Awvoan -is Bew.,York\" waa\nalmost the high spot of the Conoert,\nthough Ronnie Ross still cannot get my\nvote for the best baritone Saxophonist\nin the world (a position he holds in many minds including those of John\nLewis and Richard Ruahton).\nThen there was Kid Ory. The best\nsumming up of this show that I heard was\n- \"I felt this was the real thing\".\nIt did some inexplicable thing to me\ninside - it was so colourful, so deep,\nso swinging, and yet so simple and so\neasy. Yes, it was the real thing.\nOf the package shows \"Jazz from\nCarnegie Hall\" probably looked the best\non paper. But J and K seemed a little out of touch with each other, and Lee\nKonitz was disastrous. On tha other\nhand Phineaa Newborn was great and Zoot\nSims showed why he is rated so highly.\nBut the time - one hardly had time to\ndecide the colour of their suits before\nthey were gone. \"Jazz test the Phil\"\nbrought the controversy concerning the\nMU and Stan Getz; the MU won. We did\nnot see Stan Getz. \"Jazz from Newport1\n\"\nsparked off considerable publicity on tha\nsubject of package shows. Everyone\neagerly awaited returns of Dizzy and\nBrubeok, and even more eagerly awaited\nthe debut of Buck Clayton. So they\nthrow all three together, add a British Group, and consequently we\nhear none of them.\nLet us also think of the British\ngroups who so ably filled out so many\nshows. But if they are only going to\nplay a couple of numbers is it really\nworth it? Vocalists too were here in farce.\nLena Home, Carmen Mafias, Sarah Vaughan,\nChampion Jack Dopree, Sonny Terry and\nBrownie MoGh.ee immediately spring to mind.\nBut there are sadder t ning s connected\nwith 1959. The year will probably be\nremembered as having a large death toll, not only on the roads, but also in jazz.\nWe lost drummers Shadow Wilson and the\ngreat 'Baby' Dodds, clarinettist Omer\nSimeon, and the \"Grand Old Man of Jazz\"\nSidney Beohet. We read with great pity\nof the death of Bil jie Holliday, and were\nshocked when we read \"The Pros is Dead\".\nLester Young had gone. Many memorial\nalbums have come on to the market; do\nnot miss those of Lester Young,\nespecially the first with Count Basis.\nAnd so we go into 1960. We know\nwe can look forward to Sarah Vaughan,\nCount Basie, and Shelly Manne and His\nMen. There is talk of Ella, Kenton\nand the Dutch Swing College, whilst\nalmost every jazz man in the States\n\"would love to play England\". Let us\nhope that we might hear more than tal h of Miles Davis, Henry\" Allen's band,\nSonny Rollins and Errol Gamer - and\nnot all in the same show either.\nRimshot.\n\n"

Then it's a brief glance inside\nthe card and another few minutes holding\nthe back flap up to the light to look\nfor erasures. Then on to the shelf with it and compare it with the value of the\nothers, and it's still raining outside and\nit's a terrible time of year.\n- Comes the evening, and we brave the\nweather to pay the seasonal rounds to relations and friends-in good time to\nelude the carol singers crepuscular\ncrescendo.

However, with over two\nthousand students Imperial College\ntogether with one or two other Colleges\nin the University is comparable in size\nwith many pro vino i al Universities, and\nis big enough to be largely self-contained within the network of University\nactivities. Apart from its variegated\nmembership, ULU is comparable in many\nways to the Unions of the major Colleges;\nand I wonder how many people knew the\nname of this year's President before\nreading \"Sennet\" (sorry for including\nthat disturbing word!).\nThe University of London is unique,\nbecause of its size, and the wide\nseparation of many of its Colleges, and\nhence ULU \u00b1a also a unique institution\nwhose functions should be just those with\nwhich the College Unions cannot adequately deal. This should include the\norganisation of inter-Collegiate\nactivities, catering for minority\ninterests, providing Union facilities\nfor the smaller Colleges, and a meeting\nplace far students of different faculties\nwhere this cannot be achieved in the\nColleges concerned (i.e. at IC).\nThe restrictive attitude of the\nso o all ed IC elite is inevitable w, ith\nso little hostel accommodation, and\nwith the existence of the \"Links\"\n\"22\", \"Chaps\" and other clubs, a cliquish attitude will exist, although\nthis in itself is not over much to worry\nabout since \"Potential Leaders\" in the\nCollege always seem concerned with such\ncliques. It is perhaps as well to\nremember the words of the \"BARd\", \"If\nyou're one of the boys and get drunk -you're a good chap, but if you're not\none of the boys and have had too much to\ndrink, you're a drunken idiot!\"\nPerhaps the greatest fault at IC\nis that it is the degree that matters,\nand NOT the University education, so\nthat there are not enough people with\nnon-academic time to play with.\nHowever, I do believe that anyone who\nreally wants a University education\ncan get it at IC.\nYours,\nA.N. Other.\nBOYCOTT Sir.\nWhen I consider my several follies\nand those of my fellow human beings, I doubt my sanity and theirs and despair\nof the future of humanity.\nHut whe hI read Mr.Barber* s comment\non the Imperial College Union motion\nabout boycotting certain goods from\nSouth Africa (published in FKLTX of\nDecember 11th1959)I was immediately\nraised from depths of despondency to\nheights of hope. In fact that hope\nhas survived into, the New Year and I hope it will be happy.\nNow we nitwits can s it bao k and\nrelax while wii e men like Mr.Barber\ndo the thinking and the talking for us.\nWe can say goodbye to Union meetings\nand such old fashioned practices as\ndiscussions. Democracy is after all a relic of a bye gone age .and must\nyield to dictatorship which is th*\nmare civilised.\nWe children (or Peter Pans\nrather) are now waiting for Kike\nBarber and the other \"wise adults\"\nto produce the solution to\napartheid. Obviously a boycott is not merely childish but infantile. .\n\n"

Friday January 15th.19604 d MEMBER OF CO SEC( studying education in underdeveloped countries) The legislation wa3 finally passed\nlast year. As a result, from last week\nno Bore non-whites may be admitted to\nthose Jfciversitiea. Instead, they will\nhave W attend segregated institutions\nbased on tribal conglomerations and set\nin remote areas of the country. While\nany ea a/ ie mio ian' may doubt whether any*\nthing but the most elementary information could be communicated through a tribal language, THE GOVERNKEM HAS LEFT\nNOTHING TO CHANCE!\nEX PRESIDENT OF NUSA S It surprised me to learn that the\nthere were any residual doubts on the\nneed for eff eot ive action against\nApartheid, There can certainly be no -doubt^q f the unpleasant mess and evil of\nthe ideology of racial segregation\nwhich lies behind it. Perhaps,\nhowever, there a few students in Britain\nwho still do not realise just how much\npersonal harm and ^divi dual suffering\nit causes in the University sp ne re as\nwell as in all others.\nAs I write this, I cannot help\nreflecting on the case of Mr. Gerald\nIsraeltam, one of the most recent vio t laa of Apartheid to arrive in London,\nhe was lecturer in Botany at the-Univarsity College of Port Hare. A few months ago, he was told, without\nany warning, that he,was to be dismissed from the staff of this all tJ non-white-oo lle ge.. No reasons were given.\nLater, the Minister of Bantu\neducation announced that he had dismissed\nMr. Israelstaa and several others ^in-clu ding two British citizens, Sir Pulque\nAgnew, registrar, and his wife Lady\nAgnew, who was head of the department\nof Geography) because he \"would not\nallow a penny of the funds under his\ncontrol to be spent on persons sabotaging Apartheid\". He still u did not\nsp eo if y how this sabotage had been\nperpetrated. But these three people\nare now out of jobs, have left their\nhomes and sought voluntary exile here\nin England.\nWhy? Because they see their dismissal not just as an isolated instance\nof governmental invasion of University\nfreedom, but as part of a carefully\nprepared plan to capture the minds of\nthe non-white people. Their bodies\nmust already be regarded as captive\nthrough a plath ara of restrictions on\nmovements, no using, marriage, speech,\nworship, employments and the absence of\nparliamentary representation and the\nban on the right to strike - to name but\na few of the inevitable accompaniment a of enforced segregation.\nNEVILLE RUBIN Underlying all educational policy\nand practice of Apartheid is the report\nof the KISSELEN Commission on \"Native\nEducation\" which led to the Bantu\nEduoation Act in195k. Introducing\nthis, the present Prime Minister, (the\nMinister of Native Affairs) told an all whit* legislator that the purpose of\nthis education \"was to ensure that for\nthe non-whites there is no.place in the\nwhite society above the level of certain\nforms of labour\"\nThat policy has bean applied, all schools for Africans had been segregated\nin South Africa, so this was not simply\na question of introducing discrimination.\nThe purpose of the legislation was to\nensure that it became a para ama aft feature of South African Society, and\nthat no African was brought up to think\ndifferently. As a result the mission\nschools were told that they must either\nteach government syllabuses - including,\ninter alia, a new course of \"Race\nStudies\", and a \"Social Studies\" course\nteaching tribal myths and glorifying a tribal system whose powers were long\nago shattered by White Domination and\nwhich is alien to the majority of the\nmillions of Africans now living in\ncities -,ar to give uc their schools\nSo far more than 5,00\u00a9 'schools have been\n\"Taken-Over\" in this way.\nBut even that was not enough. Two\nof the Universities Xth\u00ab Universities of\nCapetown and Witwaterarand) still remain\nu nse grated, so the,government announced a legislation to enforce the exclusion of\nnon-whites from these as well. The idea\nwas first mooted in1948. It was\nresolutely opposed by all but a few of the\nstudents and staff members involved, both\n\u2022hits and non-white. It was feu fh t by\n,the majority of the .Univereities and even\nseverely criticised by those.academics\nwho had hitherto supported Asarthsid..\nBut the government went on with its plan.\nIt has al ven itself the power to\nappoint the College Councils, Senates,\nand Staff Members; to esta Di ish the\nCriteria for the selection of students;\nand to dismiss Staff Members (on a variety\nof so-called \"misconducts\", one of whl cn is criticism of the policy of admin if t:st ration of the government) and this\napplies not only to the new institutions,\nbut also to the already segregated\nCollege of Port Hare.\nWhatever 1960 may mean for British\nstudents, it looks as if it may mean the\nend of a civilised education for Af ric\nAfricans in South Africa. The laws w which have brought this situation; a ho a*. were passed in the teeth of vigorous\nopposition from South African students,\nBritish and Commonwealth students,\"and\nthose of 65 other countries.

IC WIN UL X COUNTHI CHAMPS\nOn the 9th of December a training\nrun was held over the University of\nLondon Championships course on Wimbledon\nCession in order that the runners should\nbe familiar with the course in readiness\nfor the \"big race\" on the following\nSaturday.\nOn the \"great day\" Imperial Collage\nentered six teams, the first team finished first with a record low score of\n28 points to be followed by University\nCollege with a score of 125 points.\nThe IC,second team finished third with\n137 points. John Collins was second\nU.S. Barber was fourth, while J. Cleator\nand A. W.1ar kum were sixth and seventh\nrespectively. The annual ras eS.C. S. vs R.S.

The spirit of this team,\nwe are oe rta in it was not the skill, have eventually enabled them to wir their\nsecond game of the season.

Mines also had their supporters\nout, but unfortunately they had to\nreturn home empty handed, although\nconsiderably loaded down by the amount\nof beer they had consumed. In the pole\nmatches, Guilds won the Forster Cup,\nby thrashing the other two Colleges to\nthe tune of 7-2, and 6-3. However\nthey were poorly supported.\nRCS started the evening well by\neasily winning the first faux individual\nswimming events, al thou ah Hitchcock was\nmade to fight all the way in the back\nstroke by Lampard. Loveman comfortably\nwon his two events, and Wilson cruised\nhome in the free style. In the one-length dash, an upset of form occurred\nwhen Key (C&G) just pipped Wilson to\nbring the RCS monopoly to an end.\nThe free style relay went to Guilds, and\nthe medley to RCS.\nIn the first polo mato h Guilds beat\nRCS 7-2. At half-time RCS, much to their\nsurprise were only losing 3-2. But\nclass will tell, and Guilds ran out easy\nwinners. In the second match, Guilds\nalthough tiring, were still too good fee-Mines and won 6-3. This meant that the\nthird mato h was of no consequence, as\nGuilds had already won the Cup.\nHowever a good sport mato h ensued, Mines\nwinning by the odd goal in five.\nThe fortunes of the swimming o lub last term have been varied.\nAlthough a fine team oh paper, the first\npolo team has yet to settle down, and so\nfar results and displays have been\ndisappointing. However, the second\nteam wen the ULU handicap KO competition,\nthus emphasising the general strength of\nthe club. . The first team started\nfavourites for this event, \"gave one of .\ntheir worst displays so far, and were\nknocked out in the second, round.\nWe hope that they are saving their\nbest displays for the league this term,\nwh i oh is the if main objective, and\nthat they will overcome the handicap of\nstarting favourites.

This is easy.\nTo prove the \"need*, one has to show that\n* sufficient number of members of the\nUnion are a ot xv aly interested enough in\nthe) proposed o IN fc to give it a reasonable\nahan ce sY a fairly pan man ent existence.\n' To show that there are \"facilities\", one\nhas to show that either the Union has\nalready got the necessary facilities\nfor the proposed dub's activities (e.g. lecture rooms, fives court, darts hoard,\netc.) or that sufficient money exists to\ninstitute these facilities.\nA few procedural rules also exist\nof course. The A.C.C. or the S. C.C. must receive notice of the proposition\nand naturally it is useful to know who\nare the supporters of any proposed club.\nA list of signatories, with the proposed\nobjects of the new o lub, must appear on\nthe Union Council Notice Board for\nseven days, in the case of the S. C.C.A similar procedure, though not obligatory, is often followed in the case of\na new A.C. C.o lub. The new o lub will oom e under the\nA.C.C. if its activities require physical\nexert oie a and if the o lub is competitive\nby nature-. All other o lub so ome under\nthe S. C.C. including o lub s such as the\nSliding,Underwater and Ski o lub sw hi oh often take part in competitions!'J) The S. C.C. includes o lub s of widely\ndifferent interests, and often with\nconflicting objects, wh i oh is probably\nwhy it traditionally runs less smoothly\nthan the A.C.C. There are rarely any arguments about\nfac. .ties. Either they exist or\nthey <i \u00abii. The trouble occurs over\nwhat constitutes a \"need\".\nSome people think that the \"need\"\nfor a club jean be proved by the number\nof signatories on a bit of paper.\nHowever it should be obvious that this\ncannot be the entire criterion. It\ncould well happen, if there were only\nfive Catholics in College, that only\nfive signatories could be obtained.\nDespite this an active committee could\nbe formed and the objects of a Catholic\nSociety are such that they play an\nimportant role in College life. On\nthe other hand, a hundred drunks have\nbeen easily persuaded to support &\nproposed Hedonist Club but it is doubtful whether such a Club had much\nfuture.\nConsequently, no specific number\nof signatories is constitutionally\nnecessary. The decision on \"need\" is taken after consideration of the\" number\nof supporters, the objects of the\nproposed o lub and any outside factors\nwh i oh may appear relevant.\nThe greatest,obstacle to the formation of any new o lub is the tendency\nof people in the saddle to look upon\nj anything new as unnecessary. Frequently the arguments used against new o lub soo ul d equally well have been used\nagainst the formation of all I.C. Clubs\nat any time.\nHowever the obj eot s of both the\nA.C.C.& the S. C.C. include the encouragement of all forms of Social and Athletic activity. There are to the best\nof my knowledge, applications for seven\nnew o lub s pending. It is to be hoped\nthat as many as possible are successful\nas the newcomers must further enrich\nour College life.

It was thought midway through the Michaelmas\nterm that we would not be able to run 7\nteams. We did however manage to do so\non oe and but for cancelled matches would\nhave done so on a number of other occasions.\nThe first team record is good, having\nwon 11 and drawn 1 of their 16 matches.\nThe ex 1st team has not as yet shown itself\nto be \"just a little bit behind .the 1st team.\" The 'A' team o ap ably led by Tom\nKing has won the majority of its matches\nand with the ex 'A', skippered by St John\nBjgkaLsy has provided the 'strength in the\nmiddle' so necessary to a large club.\nDave Titley'a Bi and Hank's lot (B2)\nhave enjoyed themselves during the past term\nwith the B2 actually recording u number of\nnotable victories. The B1 team have\ncertainly been unfortunate in loosing a number of their matches by the odd one or\ntwo points.\nAltogether the rug ger has been good,\nbut if we are to improve our results a little more work is necessary all round.\nTeam records will appear, I hope, in the\nnext issue.\nM.
