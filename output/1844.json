Based on a 1920s Dutch Barge, the\nbookshop is the work of two friends Paddy Screech and Jonathan Privett and has\namassed a large following due to its novelty\nand the selection of books on offer.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Word on the Water is\none of London\u2019s most famous bookshops,\nsomething akin to Shakespeare and Company in Paris with its novel charm, larger-than-life owners - and did I mention the\nfantastic selection of books? I\u2019ve patronised\nthe quaint barge a few times when I could\nafford to splurge: the book prices aren\u2019t\nnecessarily cheap, with many selling for\ntheir RRP or greater. Many of the books are\nsecond hand and curated by the Screech\nand Privett themselves - I told them on my\nlast visit how they had such a good collection and was told that the books available\nare based on what they themselves would\nlike to read. I was also complimented on my\nselection of Hells Angels by Hunter S.\nThompson.\nBeyond its Bohemian exterior, the main\ndraw is the chance to find really good steals\nfor those who are avid book collectors. I\u2019ve\nmanaged to score an uncorrected proof\ncopy of Mieko Kawakami\u2019s Heaven, and my\ncopy of Women, Race, and Class (see Felix\n1831), but with any second-hand bookshop\nit takes time and, most importantly, luck to\nfind good books.\nI would definitely recommend a visit,\neven if it just to browse and have a chat with\nthe owners. But be careful or you may end\nup spending a lot of money if you\u2019re not!\nBooks Editor\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\nFeet moving without will, there\u2019s the next\nfloor. It\u2019s the history section; you hear the cry\nof mediaeval soldiers, and turning your head\nyou cross the bridge from the Americas to\nAsia in a matter of steps.\nLeaving the language section, you download Duolingo.\nFinally, the fifth floor is reached. Eyes hun-grilyeatingthedeliciouscakesondisplay,you\norder at the caf\u00e9 you discovered at the top of\nthis hive. Reasonably priced coffee in hand,\nyou take a seat. You let the hustle of workers\nand friends drown into a general pleasant cacophony of human sound. The readers settle\ninto their stories, with the numbing sound of\nconversation adding colour to their stories.\nNo singular conversation can be picked out.\nYou find there is nothing like blending into a\ncrowd of like-minded people.\nIt\u2019s not often that a shop musters a 4.7-star\nreview when a revolution-starting number\nof 10,933 reviews are attached to it. With five\nfloors, it spans all kinds of genres including a\nwhole floor dedicated to music and another\nto foreign languages. It can be safe to say that\nFoyles in Charing Cross is a book lover\u2019s hav-en, as its trademark statement suggests.\u202f\u202f\nNot far from Leicester Square crossed by\nthe Northern and Piccadilly lines, and also\nclose to Covent Garden and Tottenham Court\nRoad, it is frankly, too easy to find and come\nfor a browse. Also hosting literary events in\nits auditorium on the sixth floor, it truly feels\nas if Foyles is the headquarters for all book\nlovers in London.\n\u2018If Foyles don\u2019t have it, no-one does.\u2019\u202f\u202f\nWhile others probably do, it is true that\nFoyles harbours a much broader range of\nbooks than other similar big names such as\nWaterstones. They are current and follow the\nwhims of booklovers, but it is evident that\nthey harbour a strong love for literature of all\nkinds. This makes Foyles a brilliant addition\nto your list of book haunts.\nWord on the Water Regent\u2019s Canal Towpath, N1C 4LW\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n22 | PHOTOGRAPHY 1 march 2024\nC\nogito ergo sum \u2013 I think, therefore I\nam \u2013 is a principle that many people\nlive by. However, it is a much harder task to prove that everyone who is not\noneself also thinks, and therefore is. I\nshould consider the possibility that it is\nonly me who can think; everyone around\nme is merely a simulation, a poor copy of\nmyself. But something doesn\u2019t sit quite\nright with me: if I am the only one who is,\nhow can others be better at maths, art, or\nsports? How am I not the be-all and end-all of human consciousness? Then it hits\nyou: the realisation that everyone else\nlives a rich and complex life, just as you\ndo \u2013 or simply put, the feeling of sonder.\nI believe this feeling is born in the\nmoment when the gap between you and\nsomeone else is bridged in an act of shar-ing. Say, for example, you are speaking\nto your coursemate who is from another\ncountry, and they share a personal experience that resonates closely with you. In\nthat moment, the distance between you\nand them is closed, and that forced closeness makes you think about who they are\nand how similar your lives must indeed\nbe. Because everyone else is also some-one.\nAna mentions this moment of closeness in her own comment with her pho-to: \u2018Being a smoker myself, often going\nfor breaks at the library, I sensed a connection in our lives. In this ordinary\nact of seeking rest, a deeper connection\nemerged \u2013 a silent understanding that\ntranscended our completely different\nlives.\u2019\nI think many photos inherently represent sonder, as they are the artist\u2019s way\nof interacting with the people around\nthem by showing their different points\nof view. In many cases, that is what street\nphotography is all about: daily moments\nsharedwithpeople,thatshowushowvery\nhuman everyone can be. \u2018It is usually\nbrief encounters like this one that offer\nthe best glimpses into the profound stories unfolding around us,\u2019 Ana further\nwrites.\nThis week\u2019s comment is brief and to\nthe point, and I will end it by letting the\nreader notice that Ana\u2019s artistic and photographic understanding far surpasses\nthat of the regular Joe. She has taken a\nmeaningful picture and conveyed a precise message that touches the viewer, me,\nand brings them closer to the artist, her.\nAs photographers, we may not always be\nable to embed in our photos this level of\ndepth and mastery, but we can aspire to\ndo so more frequently and continually\nimprove our craft.\nSonder\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nHeadPhotographer\nROLANDO CHARLES\nWhy the world\ndoesn\u2019t revolve\naround you\nScan the QR code\nto submit for the\nnext theme \u2018The\nEnd ofa Cycle\u2018:\nInterlude Ana Villarrubia Palac\u00edn\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial london bookshops | 19\nISSUE #1844\nS\nkoob is a second-hand\nbookshop that has been\noperating since 1979 in\nvarious locations throughout\nLondon, before moving to the\nGrade II listed Brunswick Centre in Bloomsbury in 2007.\nSkoob has generous opening\nhours from 10:30am to 7:30pm\n(apart from Sundays) and is\nopen 7 days a week.\u202f\u202f\nOutside, the shop maintains\nan unremarkable glass and\nconcrete look. It is engulfed by\na modernist concrete development and flanked by a big Waitrose. Walking downstairs from\nthe discrete entrance, howev-er, you are greeted by a rich\nburgundy floor surrounding\na bespoke Skoob logo mosaic.\nLooking up, there are books\neverywhere. Where there is\na flat wall, there is a book-shelf. Often, books are stacked\nhorizontally in what normally would serve as free space\nbetween rows, with those\non lower shelves spilling out\nonto the floor. The utilitarian\nshelves seem to bear the weight\nof the Brunswick Centre above\nand the aisles of Waitrose seem\na world away.\u202f\u202f\nThe shop is laid out like a\nlarge old key. Turning left, the\ncentral spine branches off into\na series of small nooks - some\nwith a single chair, some with-out. The only sound is a light\nhum emitted from the foil\ninsulated air conditioning pipe\nthat runs along the low ceiling\nand through the top shelves,\nforcing books to make way\nhorizontally for the fixture.\nOperationally, this ensures\nthat Skoob is at a completely\nunnoticeable temperature and\nvolume. Alongside the complete lack of natural light, time\nstands still. Turning right, the\ncircular bow of the key contains\na small staff area and till with\nshelves that loop around, encircling the custodians. Categories of books in Skoob are broad\nand largely academic. A successful trip would be to come\nwith a given period, place, or\npolitics in mind.\nSkoob forces you to bend\nand stretch to find worthwhile\nbooks (a lot of which are not).\nThe small spaces and full-length shelves, no two of which\nare the same, make it a physical\nchallenge akin to a marathon\nas opposed to a sprint, but with\nthe task all the more rewarding.\nUpon purchasing (all books are\nreasonably priced at approximately half of stated RRP) and\ntravelling back upstairs, you\nare thrust back into a more or-ganised, less interesting world.\nWhilst Skoob could reasonably be described as chaotic and\nquite hard work, it is the perfect\nenvironment to discover something completely new.\nBooks Writer\nTOM SAVAGE\nci beaucoup Madame.\u201d (Thank you very\nmuch Madame). I responded gratefully and\nretrieved the newest issue from the collec-tion.\u202f\u202f\nWith the newest Asterix et Obelix snug\nin my arms, clutching it tight as if it was\nmy beloved teddy bear, I slid across the\nbookshelves, eyes laser focused on every\ntitle, hoping for something familiar. In the\nproper novel sections, my luck was slim.\nConsidering I only learned French from my\nmother while living in a different country,\nadult literature may be a stretch from my\nskills. Advancing to the teenager\u2019s section,\nI discovered a wonderful book about teenage crime. As content as one feels when discovering new books, I skipped slowly to the\ncheckout counter to pay, before succumbing to any more irresistible books.\u202f\u202f\u202f\n\u201cCeux-ci s\u00b4il vous plait monsieur.\u201d (These\nhere, please.) I said as I gleamed with pride.\nThe man behind the counter understood I\nwanted to pay, despite his angled brows.\n\u201cCash or card?\u201d Oh, I thought. Not a Frenchman.\u201cCard\u201d,Ireplied,slightlyembarrassed.\u202f\u202f\nExiting the store, I turned around to admire\u201cLibrairieLaPage\u201dwritteningoldonto\nthe red frame. How could I have walked\npast here numerous times and never seen\nit? Saddened by the worldwide closure of\nbookstores due to the surge of audiobooks,\ndigital books on Kindle and online shop-ping, I hope that this bookstore will endure.\nWhile international cuisine in London\ngives foreigners a sense of home, foreign\nbookstores are gems that offer more than a\nfleeting experience; they foster growth and\nexploration. Eager to return soon, I aim to\nexplore the lower ground floor and, in doing so, delve into my overlooked culture.\nSkoob\n7 Harrington Rd, South Kensington, SW7 3ES\nThe Brunswick off, Marchmont St, WC1N 1AE\n\n"

Upon graduating from Imperial\nin 2020, he moved back to northern\nGaza. He was living with his family\nthere until the 7th October attacks on\nIsrael last year.\nIsrael\u2019s subsequent retaliatory\nattacks forced Qtati to evacuate his\nhome, and move south. His words\npainted a picture of the appalling\ncircumstances that he, his family and\nother Gazans faced \u2013 a struggle to\nfind food, water, and electricity in the\nday was replaced with the sound of\nbombs in the night.\nIn a second article, Qtati described\nthe runaway inflation in Gaza caused\nby supply shortages, and the squalid\nconditions people were forced to live\nin, with 50 to 60 people to a single\nroom.\nTo this point, we had relied on\nQtati\u2019s messages to the Friends of\nPalestine group chat \u2013 our initial\nattempts to contact him were in\nvain, because of the volatility of\ntelecommunications in the Gaza\nStrip.\nIn December, however, we were\nable to reach him, beginning an\nexchange that would culminate in a\n20-minute interview, and this week\u2019s\ncover story.\nQtati\u2019s desperation was apparent\nin the early WhatsApp messages he\nsent to us. He described his difficulty\nin finding fuel for the journey to\nEgypt: \u201cDuring the pause, I had to\nsleep (with other hundreds of people)\nin front of the fuel station for four days\nto get some fuel for my car. I couldn\u2019t\nget any fuel and now I have my car\nparked and running errands on foot\nor a donkey and a cart if I\u2019m lucky.\u201d\nQtati, his wife, and newborn child\nare now safely in Egypt. But his family\nremains scattered across southern\nGaza \u2013 in Rafah, Khan Yunis, Deir\nal-Balah and elsewhere \u2013 as the IDF\nplans its assault on Rafah, part of an\nattempt to eliminate Hamas after its\nterrorist attacks on Israel last year.\nQtati has started a GoFundMe\npage to help evacuate his family,\nconsisting of 18 children and seven\nadults.\n'The situation in Gaza has\ndeteriorated rapidly,' he writes in a\nharrowing message on the page.\n'My family, who were assured safety\nupon their evacuation to Rafah in the\nSouth, now find themselves in the\nmidst of relentless bombings. The\npromise of safety has been shattered,\nand the fear of a ground invasion\nlooms over them.'\nThis war has caused so much\nsuffering over the past few months\nin Israel, Gaza, and across the world.\nAt its heart are families like Qtati\u2019s,\ncaught in the crossfire, struggling to\nmake it from one day to the next.\nIf you would like to support Qtati\nin his attempts to extricate his young\nfamily, you can scan the QR code on\nthis page. Before you donate, please\nensure you read GoFundMe\u2019s terms\nof service, at https://www.gofundme.\ncom/c/terms.\nSelina Ye\nLink to the GoFundMe page in\nQtati's name\nLink to GoFundMe's terms of\nservice\n\n"

If the\nsociety is eligible for it, the grant requested is provided by the Union to subsidise any underfunded activi-ties, to promote the well-being of all students. A short\nstudy of the overview reveals the distribution of grants\nrequested, the most expensive sectors, the best funded\nsocieties, and the ways by which these societies fund\nthemselves.\nAccording to Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nChristian Cooper, the total grant budget is \u00a3425,000, a\nsignificant sum; however, the public records show CSPs\nrequesting more than twice the amount of the budget\nat \u00a3884,000 [Fig. 1]. How the Union will manage is un-known, but it never hurts for CSPs to rely on self-gener-ated income (SGI) if their budgets are cut.\nData shows us that 38% of all CSPs do not request a\ngrant \u2013 a strange move, considering how the grant has\nbeen shown to aid two of the three most expensive sec-tors,namelySportsandICSMSU,reducetheirdeficitsfrom\naround \u00a3430,000 and \u00a3100,000 respectively, to almost\nzero[Fig.2].Unsurprisingly,theSportsandRecreationsec-torsrequirethemostgrant[Fig.3]:purchasingequipment,\ntransport, halls or fields, and competition trips is cheap for\nneither large nor small societies.

This will enable the psychiatrist to\ncreate a non-judgemental space and help support the\npatient in trusting it. Moreover, mirroring the patient\u2019s\nself-descriptive language can help the patient feel that\ntheir hidden identity is being seen. It is not the patient\u2019s\nresponsibility to educate us; however, it is appropriate\nto be sensitively curious and actively ask about it while\nacknowledging the unique struggles of being queer,\nparticularly amidst the patient\u2019s unique intersections\n\u2013 such as migratory history, class, caste, ethnic group.\n\u2018Tackling\u2019 stigma in the clinic requires actively compensating for the historic anti-queer violence associated\nwithin these same psychiatric walls. Thus, starting with\nthe creation of a safe space is paramount. Once this safe\nrapport has been built, and the psychiatric history taken,\nthen, what can the psychiatrist do next?\nFollowing the creation of a stigma-free clinic space,\nthe psychiatrist must critically challenge how psychiatry\napproaches queer patients today. If poor mental health\nin queer populations is fuelled by societal stigma, then\n\u2018healing\u2019 must address this stigma. Yet, existing management guidelines do not. Instead, psychiatry today\nfails to consider queer patients\u2019 unique challenges and\nindividualises their problems through signposting to\none-to-one therapy. Collectively, this depoliticises queer\npeople\u2019s political expression of distress and detracts\nfrom the struggles of power relations that violate their\ncommunity.\nFor a queer person struggling with estrangement after\ncoming out to their family, can six weeks of Cognitive\nBehavioural Therapy skills help negate the lifetime of\nstigma which perpetuates this emotional violence? Or\nfor the queer individual struggling with heightened\nanxiety around hate crimes, can a beta blocker make\nhate crimes more tolerable? In diagnosing these patients\nsimply with \u2018generalised anxiety disorder\u2019 or \u2018major depression\u2019, are we failing our patients by being apolitical?\nThe onus falls on today\u2019s psychiatrist to investigate the\npotential needs for social justice driven therapy.\nSocial Justice Oriented Therapy\nWhilst the benefits of therapies, such as affirmation\ntherapy, are undeniable, a purely apolitical approach\nis destined to fail, as they do not acknowledge the\nintersectional lived experiences of patients. Current\napproaches are Eurocentric, hyperindividualistic and\nreductively biomedical, silencing the political struggles\nat play. Given that queerphobic stigma is a systemic issue of social injustice, it is worth asking whether social\njustice driven therapy may be appropriate for queer\nindividuals whose poor mental health is driven by\nstigma.\nFor example, digital documentary workshops have\nbeen used by refugee mental health patients as a way\nof documenting their struggles, whilst simultaneously\nchanging societal attitudes by sharing poignant stories.\nThough the real-world impacts on society may seem\ntiny, it is the accumulation of such collective, creative\napproaches which can create seismic shifts in society.\nAlternatively, another approach to social justice-driven therapy may be tackling the isolating nature of\nanti-queer stigma, by signposting patients to community groups as one part of their \u2018treatment\u2019. Here, connection may form a key therapeutic process.\nWhilst these are some top-down suggestions, ulti-mately, we must take a decolonial, patient-centred approach and ask patients themselves what they need.\nCurrently, the silencing of their voices in our medical\nand psychiatric curriculum is a direct product of queer-phobic neglect. The AIDS pandemic is a devastating\nexample of medicine\u2019s discrimination of queer people\nleading to the neglect of queer people\u2019s suffering. Such\ndiscrimination within medicine must be tackled.\nTackling Queerphobia in Medicine\nBefore we think about psychiatric research, it is worth\nacknowledging that the impact of stigma is not just\npsychological. To understand the full extent of the\nimpact, psychiatrists must conduct and encourage\nresearch on queer patients\u2019 health outcomes not only\nwithin psychiatry, but also in other specialties. Given\nour current evidence-based approach to medicine, very\nlittle can change in the system without clear evidence to\ndemonstrate it.\nWith this evidence, another key area that requires\nstigmabustingiswithinmedicaleducation.Psychiatrists\nmust come together to redesign the curriculum, so that\nit centres queer patients\u2019 voices in a non-stereotypical\nmanner (e.g. not only in relation to sexual health) so\nthe stigma of queerness as \u2018disorder\u2019 is not further\nperpetuated. This new curriculum must challenge and\ndismantle students\u2019 internalised queerphobia. This is\ncrucial if we are to prevent future generations of queer\npatients from being violated by queerphobic healthcare\nprofessionals, leading to the perpetuation of fear,\navoidance of healthcare and thus worsening health\noutcomes.\nLooking Beyond\nBy valuing the subjective experience of the patient,\npsychiatrists are uniquely placed to centre, support and\nadvocate alongside queer patients. Whilst worldwide\nqueerphobia cannot be tackled overnight, there are\nseveral therapeutic and social justice-driven changes\nwhich can be orchestrated, but only if the psychiatrist\nrecognises their own onus and agency in social change.\nQueer communities have suffered discriminatory\nneglect by public health for centuries. It is now time to\nlead a decolonial, intersectional shift within medicine\u2019s\napproach to disease, by championing sociopolitical\nactivism as preventative medicine for queer patients\nand beyond.\nPrevious experiences of\ndiscrimination, both within\nand outside of healthcare,\nmay predispose them to\nexpect queerphobia\n\u201c\nbernardbodo\n\n"

From an evolutionary standpoint, being\nrejected from a social group is a threat to one\u2019s survival.\nUnsurprisingly, stigma, an insidious form of rejection,\ncreates severe physiological distress, which manifests\nin poor mental health. For LGBTQ+ individuals who\nexperience queerphobia, the devastating impacts of\ndehumanisationcanbeseenthroughdisproportionately\npoor health outcomes; queer people are nearly twice\nas likely to experience poor mental health, self-harm\nand suicide compared to cis-heterosexual individuals,\nas stated in the 2016 Youth Chances report. Tackling\nthis mental health crisis in queer populations requires\na comprehensive understanding of the sources and effects of queerphobic stigma \u2013 both interpersonal and\ninstitutional. First, we can ask: how does anti-queer\nstigma lead to poor mental health?\nTracing Stigma, Facing Stigma\nWhile it is easy to see the causative link between\nqueerphobic hate crimes and their potentially\ntraumatic impacts on violated individuals, the poor\nmental health outcomes we see in queer populations\nare not exclusively based on single episodes of physical violence. Instead, the causative factors are chronic\nand often covert across the queer person\u2019s lifetime. To\nexplain the insidious nature of this stigma, let\u2019s briefly\nexamine Europe\u2019s history of queerphobia.\nA genocidal drive to systematically \u2018cleanse\u2019 queer\npeople from society was present throughout Western\nhistory. Countries have done this via ecclesiastical laws,\nthe criminalisation of homosexuality, and even the\nweaponisation of psychiatry \u2013 through pathologising\nqueerness as a mental disorder. Since the redaction\nof Section 28 and declassification of homosexuality\nfrom the DSM, the governance of sexuality has stopped\nbeing a matter of state. Heteronormativity and\nqueerphobia have further served to reinforce mainstream institutional queerphobia as seen in the media\nand education (including medical education). Furthermore, the threat of legal imprisonment, psychiatric\nisolation, and social exile have served to violently deter\nqueer expression.\nConsequently, queer self-expression becomes\nthreatening to one\u2019s survival amidst a cis-gendered\nheterosexual society. The threat of exile, physical\nviolence and an unaccepting world become constant\nstressors. Queer people are thus forced to sacrifice\ntheir authenticity for connection, and constantly be on\nsurvival mode while hiding their queerness \u2013 not only\nfrom others, but sometimes even from themselves. This\nnot only creates a severe sense of isolation, but denies\nconnection with other queer people. Moreover, the\n\u2018mismatch\u2019 between one\u2019s inner self and the external,\nheteronormative world, worsens internal distress.\nThis \u2018mismatch\u2019 and confusion can start at an early\nage. Societal and familial erasure of queerness means\nthat the queer person often grows up without adequate\nlanguage to describe their own feelings. Suppression\nand \u2018correction\u2019 of these feelings by primary caregivers\ncan further this sense of internalised dissociation.\nThis, coupled with internalised homophobia,\ncan cause self-hatred and distress. Effectively, the\ndevelopmental absorption of societal norms means\nthat the queer person cannot escape their constant\nproximity to rejection from society.\nCollectively, the cumulative microaggressions -the constant vigilance of rejection, the self-directed\nqueerphobia, the perceived and received external\nqueerphobia, and isolation - foster poor mental health\nin the queer person. Thus, we see that stigma creates\na lifetime of negative impact on the queer individual,\ntheir relationships with themselves, others, and even\nother health professionals. This leads to catastrophic\nimpacts observed through severe health inequalities.\nHow, then, can the psychiatrist start to attempt to tackle\nthis expanse of stigma?\nSilence is Violence\nLet us start with the first interaction with the patient:\nin the consultation room. To create a stigma-free clinic\nroom, we must recognise and tackle the bidirectional\nbarriers that both the queer patient and the psychiatrist\nbring, as a direct result of stigma.\nFor the patient, previous experiences of discrimina-tion, both within and outside of healthcare, may predispose them to expect queerphobia. Safety-driven scepticism about the doctor\u2019s trustworthiness may lead to\nthem foreclosing key health information, especially given psychiatry\u2019s historically violent approach to \u2018managing\u2019 queer patients, such as with conversion therapy.\nThe psychiatrist is not immune to the impact of\nanti-queer stigma either. As member of a queerphobic\nmedical society, the psychiatrist must contend with\ntheir own internalised queerphobia. Alongside this,\nthe psychiatrist may also face the challenge of feeling\nunderprepared to support queer patients, given the\nmedical curriculum\u2019s stigma-driven systemic neglect in\nStigma creates a lifetime of\nnegative impact on the queer\nindividual\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial NEWS | 7\nISSUE #1844\nW\nill generative AI transform academic\ncommunication? Almost certainly. But what\nwill this transformation look like? Now, that\u2019s far\nharder to predict. There is nothing inevitable about how\nAI will be used within universities, who will determine\nits legitimate use, and who will benefit. We cannot\nbe sure that generative AI will make the world easier\nor fairer. However, we can be sure that the need for\neffective communication will remain. And as George\nBernard Shaw so beautifully expressed it:\nThe single biggest problem in communication is the\nillusion that it has taken place.\nCommunication depends so very much on people at\nthe end of the day, and whilst it certainly depends on the\nwords we use, it also depends on how we connect with\neach other as humans. Communication includes how\nwe understand the world, how we find our place within\nthe world, how we create and express our identity in\ndifferent contexts, and how we bring about change. If\nwe stop valuing communication, it\u2019s hard to see how our\nlives will be easier.\nEffective communication is crucial to academic\nsuccess and is not achieved by generating a\ngrammatically correct text alone. A grammatically\ncorrect sentence does not guarantee clear, effective\ncommunication. The example sentence below follows\ngrammatical rules, but do we know for certain\nwhich item the writer is identifying as toxic and\nenvironmentally unsafe?\nSubstrate B can be isolated with good yield from crude\nextract or the acid precipitate from the synthesis of raziline,\nwhich is somewhat toxic and is environmentally unsafe.\n(http:/\n/bio-text.com/ThatWhichb.html,accessed29/01/24)\nI\u2019ll let you consider the implications of such types of\nambiguity, and other fears that exist around AI creating\nscientific texts that cannot be trusted.\nWhile everyday tasks at Imperial may become\nincreasingly moderated through generative AI\ntechnologies, you, the writer, still need to know what\nyou want to communicate, and be sure that you\u2019ve\ncommunicated it in the way that you wanted to\ncommunicate it in the first place. Communication is far\nmore than a set of skills that can be left to an algorithm.\nAnd yes, I would say that, wouldn\u2019t I? After all, I\u2019m\na specialist in academic communication whose career\ncould be in jeopardy if some of the more extreme takes\non generative AI were to be realised \u2013 such as the notion\nthat writing and communication skills will become\nredundant if they can be automated. I am, however, far\nfrom convinced this will happen.\nI feel a productive step is to ask what effective\ncommunication actually means. There are technical\naspects: it\u2019s hard to imagine that the ability to explain\ninformation clearly and concisely, in a way that speaks\nto the expectations and values of the audience, will ever\nnot be a good thing. But there\u2019s more. Think about your\ntime at Imperial: what types of communication matter,\nand when? What skills did you not realise you had, or\nrealised too late were expected as obvious features of\nbeing a good student and researcher?\nThe Centre for Academic English (CfAE) team are a\ntrustedsourcewhosupportyouthroughoutyourdegree.\nWe are here to help you in your endeavours to improve\nyour academic communication to get the grades you\ndeserve and to set you on a path towards a successful\ncareer. And we really mean it \u2013 as only humans can.\nI personally find supporting students and researchers\nto become effective communicators a challenge, but\nan exciting one. I\u2019ve been teaching and researching\nacademic communication for around thirty years. I\nstill feel there is so much more to learn, including how\nAI can support a person\u2019s academic communicative\ncompetence but not undermine their unique academic\nvoice, their individual academic identity, or their\npersonal agency.\nWe have online self-study learning blocks which help\nyou build your own personalised learning pathway, live\nsessions where you can practise your communication\nskills and receive targeted feedback, a weekly \u2018CfAE Lab\u2019\nwhere you can come for some quiet space to write and\nbe supported by CfAE tutors via informal 1-1s, as well\nas bookable online 1-1s with our tutors for advice and\nguidance on any aspect of academic communication.\nAnyone can be an effective communicator, but this\nrequires time, patience and commitment. My team have\nbeen working on an entire review of our provision to\nmake it more helpful for each of you as individuals and\nto provide you with the support you need when you need\nit. This is a work in progress developed in collaboration\nwith student partners through StudentShapers projects\nand by incorporating the suggestions and feedback we\nreceive. Our work is driven by who you communicate\nwith and what you need to say. Your voice will always\nmatter and we are here to help you shape what you want\nto say.\nFinally, I\u2019d like to leave you with something the\nlate Jim Rohn said about communication and human\nconnection:\nIf you just communicate, you can get by. But if you\ncommunicate skilfully you can work miracles.\nAnd whilst that sentence might have made some of\nyou cringe, you know that he created it, he meant it, and\nyou understood his intention and responded.\nDirectoroftheCentreforAcademicEnglish\nJULIE KING\nHow \u2018AI\u2019 (all in) are you on AI?\nDr Julie King on AI and\nhow Imperial's Centre\nfor Academic English\ncan support you.\nScan to learn more about the\nCentre for Academic English\nDr Julie King is the Director of the Centre for Academic English,\nwhich provides College members with support reading,\nwriting, and listening, so that they can improve their academic\ncommunication.

The CMS,\nor Bonn Convention, was established\nin 1983, and documents endangered\nterrestrial, avian, and aquatic migratory\nspecies.\nThe organisation recently released a\nreport on the global state of migratory\nspecies, which emphasised the ecological\nand cultural significance of these species,\nas well as the impact that climate change\nis having on their migratory patterns.\nThe report states that, of all CMS-listed\nmigratory species, 20% are under threat\nof extinction and the populations of\n44% of them are in decline. Although\nthese numbers fall roughly in line\nwith the estimated figures for extinction risk and population decline in all\nspecies, the high ecological and symbolic\nvalue of migratory species\nmakes their endangerment a\nmatter of particular concern.\nMigration enables more widely\nspread pollination and seed\ndispersal, the seasonal arrival and\ndeparture of these species often holds\ncultural significance, and they are key\nin maintaining the integrity of multiple\nfood chains along their migratory routes.\nChanges to local climate patterns have\nbeen identified as a driver of population\ndecline and increased extinction risk\nin migratory species. One example is\nthe direct effect of temperature on sex\ndetermination in sea turtles: one study\nfound in its sample population that 87%\nof adult turtles were female. Habitat\nloss due to climate change indirectly\nimpacts migration,\nwith an example being\nthe decline in dugongs\nowing to a reduced\nfrequency of seagrass\nmeadows, one of their\nprimary food sources.\nClimate change\nhas also induced\nmigration in some\nnon-migratory species,\nwith local warming driving movement\nto higher altitudes and more northern\nlatitudes. Mountain-dwelling pikas in\nNorth America and Asia are sensitive to\nwarm temperatures and are expected to\nrelocate to higher, cooler grounds over\ntime. However, if this migration occurs\nat a slower rate than global warming,\ntheir habitat range could shrink and they\ncould eventually die out.\nThe CMS report is a fresh reminder\nof the dire impacts that climate change\nis having on the natural world, and\nits inextricable link to decreasing\nbiodiversity. This is compounded by the\ndisruption caused to migratory corridors\ndue to rapid urbanisation and population\ndeclines from hunting in the past. Local\nclimate warming effects such as \u2018urban\nheat islands\u2019 keep birds\ncomfortable in their\nsummer locations for\nlonger \u2013 delaying their\nmigratory cycles and in\nturn disrupting their\nbreeding patterns \u2013\nwhile overfishing and\nincidental catches\npose additional\nthreats to the numbers of migratory aquatic species such as\nwhitetip sharks.\nWildlife crossings, which have been\ngaining traction in recent years, are one\nviable solution to the fragmentation\nof wild areas by roads and railways.\nThese bridges provide a safe pathway\nfor animals (and humans) to avoid cars\nand trains. Wildlife crossings have\nbeen majorly successful, particularly in\nEurope and North America, with one of\nthe longest being Natuurbrug Zanderij\nCrailoointheNetherlands,whichopened\nin 2006 and stretches 800m over several\nroads and railways. These crossings are\nalso sometimes called ecoducts, or green\nbridges in the UK, where Natural England\nis beginning to look at more-ambitious\nbridge-development projects. Some\ncases have even shown birds to prefer\nflying over these bridges rather than over\nroads.\nEcoducts can be highly effective at\nsupporting the preservation of migratory\nspecies, especially in places where\nmigratory routes are well known, such\nas for reindeer in Sweden, or\nbobcats and cougars in the US.\nHowever,thisisonlyoneaspectof\na complex issue, and the problem\nremains that increasing pressure\nfrom local climate-change effects could\nquickly become critical for the migratory\npatterns for some species. The CMS\nreportoutlinespriorityactionsunderfive\nkey areas: habitat preservation, tackling\noverexploitation, environment pollution\nreduction, climate change mitigation,\nand legal protection for endangered\nspecies. Most of the recommendations\nrevolve around the monitoring and\nrecording of migratory species and\ntheir movements, as well as enforcing\nconservation practices and lessening\nthe impacts on animals from human\nactivities.\nFor anyone interested in ecology,\nconservation, or climate change, the CMS\n\u2018State of the World\u2019s Migratory Species\u2019\nreport is a fascinating read and covers a\nwide range of case studies from all over\nthe globe.\nMoving with the heat\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0018\u0019\u001b\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0019\u0018\u0012\n\n"

Developed by the pharmaceutical company Vertex Pharmaceuticals, based in Boston,\nand the biotechnology company CRISPR Therapeutics,\nbased in Zug, Switzerland, the therapy aims to provide\nrelief from the debilitating pain and constant need for\nblood transfusions caused by these diseases.\n\u03b2-thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia are both diseases caused by underlying problems in haemoglobin,\nthe body\u2019s oxygen-carrying molecule. In sickle cell anae-mia, the production of abnormal haemoglobin leads to\nmisshapen and sticky red blood cells. These can form\nclumps that clog blood vessels and reduce oxygen supply to tissues, leading to severe episodes of pain (pain\ncrises). On the other hand, \u03b2-thalassaemia causes low\nlevels of haemoglobin in the blood which can trigger\nfatigue, shortness of breath, and more serious complications such as an irregular heartbeat.\nCasgevy\u2019s premise is to harness the power of gene\nediting using CRISPR-Cas9, and alleviate the suffering\nand pain that these diseases cause. It does so by making use of an enzyme called Cas9, which has the ability to cut DNA at certain sites. A snippet of RNA (guide\nRNA, or gRNA for short) is used to guide Cas9 to a specific site within the genome where it is required to make\na change. The changes can either be made by deleting\nspecific DNA that is unwanted or associated with causing disease, or by rewriting entire sections of DNA by\nintroducing an artificial template strand.\nIn the case of Casgevy, the treatment removes stem\ncells from the bone marrow of afflicted individuals.\nThesearecellsthatareundifferentiated,andfromwhich\nall other specialised cells of the body form. CRISPR-Cas9\nis used to edit the genes coding for haemoglobin in these\ncells; in particular, the BC11A gene \u2013 which prevents the\nformation of foetal haemoglobin \u2013 is targeted. The DNA\ncoding for this gene is cut using CRISPR-Cas9, which\ndisrupts gene function and unleashes the production\nof foetal haemoglobin. This is haemoglobin that does\nnot contain the same abnormalities as that of sufferers\nof \u03b2-thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia and can help\ntreat them and restore normal haemoglobin function.\nThe approval of the therapy came only after the\nMHRA declared that \u2018promising\u2019 results from clinical\ntrials were obtained. For sickle cell anaemia, 29 out of\n45 trial participants were followed for long enough to\ndraw results. Of those 29, 28 were completely relieved of\npain and other symptoms one year after the therapy was\nadministered. In the case of \u03b2-thalassaemia, on the other hand, 42 out of 54 trial participants were followed for\nlong enough to draw results. Of those 42, 39 had no need\nto undergo blood transfusion a year after treatment. The\nother three participants saw their frequency of requiring transfusion reduce by 70%.\nWhile the side effects of the therapy are minor \u2013 ranging from nausea to fatigue \u2013 several scientists, including\nDr. David Rueda from Imperial, warn that the usage of\nCRISPR-Cas9 in therapies such as this often causes unintended genetic modifications, which can have severe\nconsequences. For now, though, cautious optimism\nseems to be the prevailing mood on the issue.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001b\u0017\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0011\u0010\u000f\u001d\u0017\u000e \u0012\u001d\u0016\u0017\u001f \b\n\u0007\u001e\u001d\u001b\u0010\u0017\u001c\u001b\u0006\u001b\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001b\u0012\u001e\u0005\u0019\u0017\u0010\u0012\u0004\u001c\nSCIENCE\nGenetic engineering\nopens new avenues\nfor blood disease\ntreatment, but is it\nviable?
