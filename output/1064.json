    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 1 1TH OCTOBER\nNews in Brief\nNew Solutions\nAttacked by CfE\nNEWS TEAM The University of London Union, the\noriginal birthplace of the recently\nreformed New Solution group (Felix\n1063), is to be disrupted in the latest\nbattle with the Campaign for free\nEducation (CfE). The 20 November\nis the date set for the CfE's march\nwhich will start from ULU buildings\nin Malet Street, central London.\nPaul Bates, Vice-President of\nULU, is keen to distance his organisation from the proceedings. In a letter written to all University of\nLondon colleges, Mr Bates insists\nthat \"ULU is playing no role whatsoever in this gathering of banner-wavers.\"\nMr Bates went on to say that\n\"Their protest is no more than a provocative one - it was at ULU last\nyear that New Solutions began the\ncampaign for change in NUS\". With\nthe 're-convening' of New Solutions\nto fight 'top-up fees' it appears that\nthe CfE wish to em baras s ULU.\nWhile Sarah White, last year's Imperial College Union President,\nwas heavily involved in New\nSolutions this year's President, Eric\nAllsop, is more reticent. He says that\nalthough the CfE are \"a load of\nTrots\" whom \"no one will ever take\nseriously\", he has not got involved in\nNew Solutions and is unlikely to do\nso in the future.\nMr Allsop questions whether New\nSolutions have got carried away with\ntheir success last year and whether\nthey are the right sort of group to\ncounter 'top-up fees'. He feels that\nthat this issue will have to be dealt\nwith on an individual basis, since it is\nnot a matter of lobbying government,\nand he does not see how a 'discus-sion group' can influence the decisions of individual institutions.\nSOUTHSIDE CASUALTY A potentially lethal cocktail of drink\nand drugs led to a serious incident in\nSouthside bar last Monday night.\nAfter drinking alcohol on top of prescribed anti-depressants a Chemistry\nPhD student collapsed in the popular\nbar at around 9:30pm. The bar staff\nwere quick to react and move her\nfrom the extremely crowded basement area with an ambulance arriving at the scene just minutes later.\nThe girl's parents were contacted\nby the College Security and taken to\nthe hospital, where it is understood\nthat she had her stomach pumped.\nThe postgraduate student has now\nfully recovered from her ordeal. It is\nalso understood that she had only\nconsumed three drinks that night,\nand had showed no signs of distress\nbefore her sudden collapse. A full\nsecurity report is due to be completed early next week and it is likely\nthat no blame will be attributed to\nSouthside bar staff.\nMONEY, MONEY, MONEY National Westminster Bank have\nwarned parents of the escalating cost\nof sending their children to\nUniversity. A study of families\nthroughout the UK found that whilst\nparents believed that it would cost\nthem around \u00a35,500 to send their\nchildren on a three year degree\ncourse, the true figure is nearer\n\u00a312,000. David McLean, Head of\nPersonal Banking Services, Nat West\nUK, said: \"Parents are significantly\nunderestimating the total cost of their\nchild's education at university,\nwhich is reinforced by over-optimistic perceptions on how much\ntheir son or daughter might borrow.\nIf provision is made early enough\nand plans are made for the financial\nburden that lies ahead, parents can\navoid sleepwalking into a nasty surprise either for themselves or their\nchildren.\"\nBOAT CLUB GETS GO AHEAD Planning permission for the development and expansion of the Imperial\nCollege boat house at Putney was\ngiven the go-ahead at the second\nhearing of the local borough planning committee during the Summer\nvacation. The amended proposal,\nprepared by the architects Troughton\nMcAslan, was approved by a12:2 majority. The earlier proposal had\nbeen opposed by David Mellor, the\nlocal Member of Parliament.\nThis positive decision comes at a time when Bill Mason picks up the\nreigns at the club after a sabbatical\nwith the Great Britain women's squad at the Atlanta Olympics.\n\"Bill's women\" finished seventh at\nthe Games, but not before they had\nrecorded the third fastest time in history for any women's crew over\n2000 metres.\nBEIT HALL INTERNET\nACTIVITIES\nThe internet connections in Beit Hall\nhave hit further trouble this week as\nCollege Residences do not approve\nof the wiring. This means that all the\nwires in the Old Hostel must be\nchecked and relayed.\nDifficulties have also arisen in\nmeeting the demand for the facility\nin the New Hostel, which faces onto\nPrince Consort Road. The Old Hostel\nwas connected by running wires\ndirectly from terminals in the Union,\nbut there are no connections close\nenough to make installations in the\nNew Hostel in this way.\nThe current internet facilities in\nstudent rooms raises questions about\nthe College's strict policies on computer usage which are difficult to\nimplement in the privacy of student\nbedrooms. Gerdjan Baker, who is\none of the sub wardens in Beit Hall\nand is involved in the installations,\nsuggests that while a student may be\nable to download a pornographic picture in ten minutes magazines can be\nbought off the top shelf at local\nnewsagents containing twenty such\npictures.\nThere are no current plans to\nextend the internet facilities to other\nImperial College Halls of Residence.\nThe Centre for Computer Services is\napparently reluctant to finance such\nprojects due to concerns regarding\ncomputer misuse and the temptation\nfor students to spend too much time\n'surfing the net' at the expense of the\ncollege studies.\nMonday 14th October\nFREE Barn Dance8.00 pm Hot food & Bar All Welcome\nI.C Chaplaincy\n\n"

The IC concerts, which were\nlaunched in 1950 by Harold Allan of\nPhysics and David Tombs of\nElectrical Engineering, have 'talent-spotted' several now world-famous\nartists, some of whom still visit us\nafter 20 years and more. Bernard\nRoberts, who gave the 700th concert\nin 1981 will be with us on 28\nNovember try his recent pair of CDs\non the Nimbus label of all of\nHindemith's piano music.\nApart from the sufficient condition of enjoying it, there are many\nother benefits from regularly listening to music in this tradition. The\nvalue of musical therapy is well-established and recent studies,\nreported in Nature and elsewhere,\nshow that musical experience and\ntraining of young children cross-fer-ti lise other mental skills. This has yet\nto be established objectively at university level (and surely the musical\nIC community would be ideal for\nsuch a study) but is a pretty good bet.\nIt seems likely that verbal communication can be improved through\neffects on stresses and pitches in\nspeech patterns. It certainly also\nhelps to increase attention span,\ncounteracting the unfortunate influence of modern media.\nThe standards of dedication and\nintellectual intensity set by professional musicians, particularly as\nsoloists or in small groups, are exemplary even for those who work in\ndisciplines as demanding as science\nand technology.\nThus music appeals to a much\nwider social spectrum than most\nother art forms; it is the most universal of the arts and provides a viewpoint of social, political and technical history in the West over the last\nfour centuries (since, say, the birth of\nGalileo in 1564).\nMost classical music is strongly\nstructured in rhythm and melody, a feature which new listeners can find\ndaunting. Sometimes the structures\nare quite complicated and sometimes\neven intentionally concealed (most\nnotoriously in some works of Alban\nBerg which took fifty years to decipher fully). It is important to know\nthat it is not necessary to recognise\nthe structures explicitly; the subconscious can recognise them subliminally. If you wish to explore further\nthe structure of a particular piece,\nyou could try the Haldane Library's excellent music collection of compact discs, tapes, books and scores.\nIt does take time.\nThe choice between Classic FM\nand Radio 3 is often settled in the\nminds of individual listeners by the\nwish to hear live performances. Live\ntelevised performances give the\nopportunity for enhanced im media cy, but there is actually no substitute\nfor being there, to witness creation in\nthe raw.\nBe there for the Miihlfeld Trio\nplaying the Brahms Clarinet Trio on\n17 October and give the other hemisphere of your brain a break!

Using the 1995-96\nseason as a benchmark, Sir Roger's investigations show that football figures very little in universities thinking and is not proving as popular as\nrugby union amongst students.\nThese findings are bourne out in\nthe figures. There are very few graduates who now play Premiership\nfootball, while the top rugby union\nclubs have teams littered with graduates and students. Similarly, though a few undergraduates play semi-pro-fess ional football at weekends, and\nthere are a few ex-school boy registrations about, many more undergraduates play rugby union for their\nlocal or home clubs, as well as for\ntheir university or college.\nThis post it ion may seem strange\nwhen one considers the huge financial rewards and fame that accompany football compared to the 'ama-t eur' sport of rugby union. This has\nchanged now with the introduction of\nprofessionalism into rugby, but why\ndo universities favour rugby with\nscholarships?\nBannister's report sought to measure the success of ten sample universities who offered sports scholarships over the last ten years.

    "content": "10 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY 1 1TH OCTOBER Simon Baker - Voice of Reason\nNow that Imperial is firing on at least\nthree cylinders, it is inevitable that\nthe old causes celebr es should come\nto the fore. For those new to South\nKen, the biggest of these is Campus\nRenaissance, the master plan to turn\nIC into Europe's largest building site,\nnow that the Channel Tunnel is fin-is he d. It is a little known fact\nAnderson Consulting rally their new\nrecruits in Chicago to the strains of\n'Simply the Best.' Presumably Schal\nInternational will fire up their con-tractors' spirits with Lulu's1969 Eurovision entry 'Boom Bang-ABang', following last week's little\nincident. When I first heard about\n'something falling from the library',\nI though it was a bit serious. Having\nread that the falling chunk weighed\nfour tonnes and almost hit someone,\nI am staggered at the seemingly blatant negligence of persons involved\nin this project. The possible consequences of such an accident had it\nhappened this week are obvious.\nWithout wishing to pre-emp t the\ninquiry, the College or Schal must be\nexpecting to be moved several fathoms down the Christmas card list of\nthe Health and Safety Executive. For\nmy dear friend Ian Caldwell, this is\nprobably not how he wanted the year\nto start.\nHowever, having managed to avoid\nthe C word last week to the surprise\nof regular readers, I must genuinely\ncongratulate him on his letter in that\nthunder er of the press IC Reporter,\nproving that his reticence in replying\nto attacks in the media are only limited to this esteemed publication. In\nDistorter, he said, of the Sherfield\nCommittee rooms (there must be\nthousands of them, given the way\nthey 'work' in that building) that\n'their condition has been subject to\ncriticism and they were, frankly a disgrace to the College...the condition of such facilities is noted by visitors to the College and it is therefore\nessential that they should be of a reasonable standard.' I have never seen\nthis key facility, but I 'll take his word\nfor it. He is, of course, right about\npublic perception. In view of this I have invited our Chancellor, the\nPrincess Royal, to have a BLT with\nme in the JCR, safe in the knowledge\nthat she walks in the footsteps of\narchitects, builders and decorators.\nThe JCR is, by virtue of its proximity to the walkway, seen by a lot of\nimportant people. It is 'frankly a disgrace to the College.' I know that students are no more than a necessary\nevil, but since most open days\ninclude a visit to this tatty dump, it\ncould prove highly counter-productive in recruiting more affluent students should fees become the norm\n(ooh, bit of politics, ladies and gen-tle men). No time to mention the Conservative\nshenanigans. I seem to have got as\nmuch stick about Lord McAlpine and\nNeil Hamilton as the party chairman.\nI shall end on a lighter note. Ever\nkeen to give you, dear reader, value\nfor money, may I suggest you slip on\nyour dancing shoes and head on\ndown to Voyager at The Complex\nthis or any Friday.

You know the feel-ing, sitting in your dressing gown\nwith a cup of tea and a fag, lazing\naround your flat watching Richard\nand Judy. Why? What purpose does\ndaytime television serve? Take, for\nexample, Rikki Lake. You may or\nmay not have seen Rikki's show\nbut, in a nutshell, average\nAmericans go on the show to share\ntheir problems with the entire\nnation in an attempt to make themselves feel better. Obviously when I say average American I mean an\noverweight twenty year old girl,\nwith twelve children who has just\novercome her drug addiction with\nthe help of her counsellor. What\nmakes these people want to tell several million people, that they have\nnever met, their entire life story on\na low quality daytime show? Who\nknows, but with show themes like\n\"Overweight lesbian couples who\nhave been abducted by aliens and\nforced into weight loss pro-gram mes\", it makes you wonder\nwhere they come from.\nI only happen to occasionally stumble across these daytime oddities,\nbut what about the audiences?\nFrom what I have seen they are all\nold women who have just stepped\nin from the cold and been roped\ninto it by a studio executive, with a couple of people from racial\nminorities thrown in for good mea-sure. Even with a bizarre audience\nand an even more bizarre choice of\ntopics these programmes seem to\nget more popular by the minute,\nwith a new version springing up\nevery thirty seconds, ranging from\nserious discussion about today's cutting social issues, including several on-camera fights between\nfeuding second cousins, to twenty\nyear old college drop-outs who\nwanted to say thanks to their mums,\nwith appropriate tears streaming\nfrom Rikki/Oprah/Vanessa's face\n(Delete as appropriate). Then, just\nwhen I thought that these programmes were only made in\nAmerica and bought up by the BBC\nto fill space, up pops Esther, and\nanother hour of off-peak viewing\nhas bitten the dust, which I will, of\ncourse, watch to the bitter end.\nTHE WEEKLY POEM\nsupplied by PoetIC\nInvaders\nThey arrived unheard.\nA few words were spoken;\na token glance.\nThey danced on a Sunday,\nwhen all were asleep;\ndanced in the deep of a2D screen.\nThe scene?

As\nfor SftW, the printing went wrong\nand so the pages are in a somewhat\nrandom order. Sorry about that.\neven more arse\nSo now I'm probably not going to get\nto bed until 5am, if that. Why?\nBecause we've got to hand collate\nthe 32 page SFTW, and so far there\nare only 5 of us doing it. There are\nabout 5000 copies of SFTW, on 8\npages... so that's far too many bits of\npaper each. Don't be sup rise d if\nyou're reading this next Wednesday.\nbut it's not all bad\nNo, really. My timetable's quite\ngood this year - except for Friday,\nwhen I start at 9am and finish at 6pm. However, there's a compulsory\ngroup project soon, and the groups\nare assigned by the lecturers, so we\ndon't get to choose ourselves. You\nmight not think that's really so bad,\nbut I'm doing computing, so most of\nmy fellow Comp3'ers are rather sad\nanorak types (sorry to the rest that\naren't). relief\nRight, I 've stopped panicking\nnow, and I have reached that strange\nstage of calm that follows the sudden\ndawn of realisation that asleep ness night lies ahead.\nThis is Alex again, and not Mark,\nby the way and as you may have\ngathered, it has been a rather difficult\nweek.

Although accidents and errors are\nbound to happen in projects as large\nas the Bio-medical Sciences building\nand the Library refurbishment, as far\nas possible those areas that are heavily used should not be a risk to those\nwho use them. This applies equally\nto sloppy concreting as to cutting\nthrough a fire alarm cable.\nDo 'accidents waiting to happen'\nhave to happen before suitable precautions or latent preventative action\nis taken?

The Transport, Welfare\nand Women's Officer positions are\ndue to be filled early next week with\njust one candidate standing for each\nof the jobs.\nThe eight ordinary members of\nCouncil, elected by the students\nrather than being ex-officio mem-be rs, are also due to be chosen on\nTuesday, at the first Council meeting\nof the year. Two of these members\nmust be first year students and another two must be postgraduate students.\nAs Felix went to press the postgraduate positions were the only ones\nwhich had not provoked any interest.\nThe Transport Officer post is\nbeing sought by Duncan Tindall,\nCivil Engineering, who at the end of\nlast year failed in his attempt to\nbecome Council Chair. Mr Tindall is\nfully seconded but it appears that his\nformer second er has withdrawn his\nsupport, with his name being crossed\nof the Election Papers. The only candidate for Transport Officer also\nfaces the difficulty of not having\nbeen a Minibus Driver for two years.\nUnion sources were unable to confirm whether this is a requirement for\nthe position and whether Mr Tindall\nwould be ineligible for election.\nHeather Whitney is the only candidate for of Women's Officer, a position which has become vacant with\nthe resignation of last year's elected\nstudent. She is understood to be\nspending a year in Sweden despite\nhaving previously been elected\nWomen's Officer. Ms Whitney,\nBiology Dept., is proposed by Neil\nMothew and is fully seconded.\nThe sole candidate for the position\nof Welfare Officer is Emma Dedman\nfrom the Physics Department. This\nelection is necessary as the previously elected candidate, Anne Ovens,\nmust take a year out and retake\nexams in June 1997. Ms Dedman is\nproposed by Paolo Cuomo from Elec\nEng, and is also fully seconded.\nThe candidates for Ordinary\nMembers of the Council include\nsome familiar names with Royal\nCollege of Science Union current\nand former officers, Rob Park and\nMatt Szyndel standing for election.\nMr Park is the current RCSU Hon\nSec and Mr Szyndel is the former\nRCSU Academic Affairs Officer.\nBoth candidates have proposer s and\nare likely to be fully seconded by the\ntime elections start. With nominations staying open until Tuesday\nevening, and as all college students\nare eligible to vote more candidates\nare expected to make their intentions\nknown closer to the election date.\nSuccessful fair for 'Active' Freshers\nPHOTO: WEI LEE\nMembers of the Circus Skills Society Showing off their moves at\nTuesday's Freshers' Fair.\nThe Imperial College Union\nFresher's Fair, held last Tuesday\nthroughout college, proved a great\nsuccess with a huge turnout attracted\nby more than a hundred stands.\nSarah Corneille, ICU VicePresident Clubs and Societies,\nexpressed satisfaction saying \"I think\nthat things went as smoothly as could\nbe expected. We seem to have quite\nan active bunch of fresher s this\nyear.\"\nNeither Living Marxism or the\nTory Reform Group were to be\nfound amongst the stands in a change\nto the published list of exhibitors.\nThe only note of discord on Tuesday\nafternoon was provided by an\nextremist Muslim group. They were\nforced to leave the Queen's Lawn by\nUnion stewards and the Sherfield\nwalkway area by College Security\nafter handing out a leaflet espousing\ntheir fanatical views.\nStripper acts for C&G fresher s JONATHAN TROUT AND ANDREW SMITH\nA male and female stripper upset the\nusually staid atmosphere of the City\nand Guilds Union Freshers' welcome\nheld at the Royal Geographic Society\nlast Monday. Sir Ronald Oxburgh's speech was followed by the stage\nshow which is believed to have cost\njust \u00a350.00.\nTo the wide eyed bemuse ment of\nthe assembled fresher s the pair of\nstrippers got up on the stage, did their\nact and disappeared. The C&G Union are believed to have organised\nthe display.\nMargaret Goodgame, Senior Tutor\nto the College and one of the dignitaries present during the official welcome of fresher s, described the antics\nas 'awful'. She said that students\nshould not have to put up with displays such as that witnessed on\nMonday, and that it is likely that\nsome students would have found it\n'unpleasant and upsetting'.\nWhile Dr Goodgame has not\nreceived any complaints about the\nshow put on by C&G, she suggest\nthat this may be due to students being\ntoo shy to come forward. The Senior\nTutor does not see any way in which\nthe Union could be disciplined since\nthey did not break any specific rules.\nProfessor Julia Higgins, Dean of\nthe C&G, denied that she was concerned by the events saying, \"I am\nnot aware that there was any problem\nwith what may have occurred.\" The\nevents took place after she and the\nother dignitaries had left the stage. Dr\nGareth Jones, College's other Senior\nTutors, who was also present prior to\nthe display was not so dismissive of\nthe strippers.\nDr Jones said that he was \"very\ndisturbed to hear that this occurred\".\nHe expressed anger at the event,\nwhich he was unaware was planned\nto follow the 'formal session'. It is\nunderstood that The Royal\nGeographical Society is also unhappy about the change of program.\nWhile they have received a letter of\napology from the City and Guilds\nUnion President, Guarav Misra, no\ndecision has been made with regard\nto future events.\nIC Union President Eric Allsop\ncommented: \"I had heard rumours\nthat such a stunt might take place,\nand had advised C& GU that this\nwould probably be a mistake,\nalthough how they present themselves to the student body is ultimately their decision.\"\nMo Dulloo, Royal College of\nScience Union President, indicated\nthat his organisation had no need for\nsuch displays saying that \"we used\nsimple interactive techniques to keep\nthe crowd going.\"\n\n"

The departure of\nMs Lawrie, mainly for family rea-sons, has left her duties to be shared\nout between the three remaining sab-bat ical s, in particular President Sarah\nWhite (President of Imperial College\nUnion last year). Speaking to Felix,\nan undeterred Ms White promised\nthat \"...the service we provide has not\nbeen affected...\"\nAlthough the extra workload is considerable and seventy to eighty hour\nweeks have been reported, so far no\nextra pay has been negotiated. Ms\nWhite's appearance at Tuesday's Imperial College Union Freshers Fair\nwas marked by a number of organisational errors, interpreted by some\nobservers as a sign of the increased\nworkload taking its toll.\nIn addition, the search for a replacement has been a source of dissent among ULU regulars. Under the\nUniversity of London Union's con-st it uti on, a free and fair by-election\nmust be held as soon as possible for\nany vacant post. However, Felix has\nreceived unconfirmed reports that the\npost would be handled by a part-time\nnon-student member of staff and,\nmore recently, that one of the nominees for the post has admitted to\nbeing 'managed' by Ms Lawrie her-self.\nA by-election has been scheduled\nPHOTO: WILLIAM LORENZ\nULU candidate Ben Hughes e mbar assed under fire. Questions remain\ndue to his endorsement and \"management\" by the previous incumbent.\nfor Monday 14th October, this being\nthe first General Union Council of\nthe year. Each college in London\nsends delegates to GUC, the sovereign body of ULU. By the close of\nnominations, only two candidates\nhad been fully proposed and second-ed. The first, Ben Hughes a self-declared nominee of Ms Lawrie, is a Masters student from University\nCollege London but knows Ms\nLawrie from his BA studies at the\nLondon School of Economics. The\nsecond, who only just beat the deadline for the nominations, is a student\nfrom Royal Holloway and Bedford\nNew College in south London.\nSpeaking to Felix, Mr Hughes\nexpanded on his plans for ULU, were\nhe to be elected to the post of VicePresident for Finance and Services,\nstating that his main aim would be to\nincrease accountability of the Union.\nHe made particular mention of the\nfinances of the organisation which,\nhe claims, are often only given cursory notice and just 'rubber stamped'\nby GUC. His previous experience of\noffice includes being a GUC delegate\nfor LSE for two years as well as\nworking with Ms Lawrie. over the\nsummer on a finance manual. Mr Hughes readily conceded that\nMs Lawrie had suggested he run for\nthe job, and named her as his \"cam-pa ign manager\". This point in particular has been questioned by\nobservers with reference to the legit-macy of an election where one candidate is so clearly favoured. Mr\nHughes went on to admit support for\nthe now discredited 'Campaign for\nFree Education' (CfE), an NUS\nsplinter group determined to reverse\nthe recent change of policy by the\nNUS executive to a more realistic\napproach to student grants and higher education funding.\nWhen pressed, Mr Hughes\nrevealed that although he would follow any mandate given to him by\nGUC, he would prefer join the campaigners at the CfE demonstration\npicketing the NUS Services confer-en ce, being hosted by ULU next\nmonth. A statement by ULU confirmed they will play \"no role whatsoever in this gathering of banner-wavers.\"\nNew Solutions, CfE battle page 2\nInside\nOVER BUDGET NatWest Bank warns parents that it\ntakes more money that they think to\nput their children through college.\nnews in brief page 2\nCOUNCIL ELECTIONS\nThree Imperial College Union\nOfficer posts are up for elections as\nwell as eight ordinary members.\npage 4\n\n"

    "content": "8 NEWS FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 10TH OCTOBER IC construction projects:\nRobin Riley decides to follow up a few strange telephone calls...\nThis Monday, the Felix office\nreceived a telephone call from a 'College health and safety representative.' If that sounds a rather hazy\ndescription, it's because he asked us\nnot to name him. We'll call him Mr\nA. Mr A. had called to comment\nupon the article in Felix last week\nconcerning the roof collapse outside\nthe library... not to deny it, but to\npraise it. He also had a few things\nhe'd like me to jot down, and put me\nonto a friend of his, whom for sim-pli city' s sake we'll call Mr B.I called\nMr B. on Wednesday, and discovered he was part of the College's finance division. He had some things\nhe wanted to get off his chest, and\nalso wished to remain anonymous.\nSensing my intrigue, Mr B. suggested that for more specific details I contact a certain Mr C from the\nCollege's Estates division. He [that\nis, Mr B.] also suggested that I shouldn't tell him [that is, Mr C] that\nit was he [that is, Mr B.] that had\ngiven me his [that is, Mr C's] extension number, or that I had spoken to\nanyone else [Mr A, that is.]\nMessrs. A and B had called to\nexpress concern at the level of safety\namong the tangled web of construction sites around College. They had\nalso called to express concern at the\nlevel of concern among the tangled\nweb of staff around College at the\nlevel of safety among the tangled\nweb of construction sites around\nCollege.\nConfused? So was I. Was this\nsome bizarre bureaucratic fantasy,\nthe product of one of the many diseased minds lurking within the\nSherfield building? No... All three\nare real people. Mr A. and Mr B. will\nremain anonymous, and those aren't their initials. Mr C, meanwhile, is\nour dear friend, Ian Caldwell, much\nmaligned director of Estates and\nbroadly responsible for the develop-ment, refurbishing and maintenance\nof buildings on campus...\nI'm not entirely sure whether to\ntreat the testimonies of Mr A and Mr\nB as brave moral crusades on behalf\nof their colleagues, unsubstantiated\ngossip or rants against no-one in par-ti cula r, but between them they\ndescribed no less than five (yes, five)\nserious breaches of safety having\noccurred on College sites in the last\nsix months. So here they are for you\nall to peruse. Admittedly, there's a small difference between a straight\n'list' of five incidents and a 'top five\ncountdown' of incidents, so I'm summer it turned the wrong way and\ncrashed into the Chemistry building.\nMr A. actually tried to play this one\ndown, claiming the crane only\n\"brushed against the side of the\nbuilding.\" I wasn't particularly convinced that cranes and buildings can\nmerely 'brush' against each other,\nand so was protected from the shock-by a healthy shell of cynicism when\nMr B. added this was no isolated\nincident, but in fact \"quite common.\"\nlowed. An investigation revealed that\nthe beams of the roof were timber\nand not concrete as first thought, and\nthat the driver would have to dye the\nrest of the seat brown to match. The\nincident was officially recorded as\n'dangerous' but library staff were\nassured that there would be no further problems with any part of the\nroof. Oops.\nStraight in at number three... My\nsources were slightly at odds over the\nspecifics, but to cut a long story short\nthe small pins which hold the large\npins which hold the block and tackle\non one of the cranes were left off.\nThis caused the block and tackle to\nfall. Neither Mr A. nor Mr B. would\nhazard a guess as to how far it fell,\nbut both agreed it was far enough to\nsnap the steel cables and leave a considerable dent in Franklin Road,\nbehind the science museum.\nAccording to Mr B, the accident\noccurred during maintenance when\nthe block and tackle should have\nbeen on the ground. Mr A. remarked\nhow anyone standing below would\nhave been 'lucky' enough to be hit by\na block and tackle weighing only 1\ntonne... had it happened slightly earlier they would also have been hit by\na concrete load weighing around 4\ntonnes. Both of my sources grew\nvery excited when they spoke of this\naccident, how it was extremely significant and had led to a high-level\nHealth and Safety Executive investigation, which may result in design\nchanges in cranes of this type.\nThe fourth incident is rapidly\nbecoming an IC legend. Due to a breakdown of hand signals between\nengineers directing operations from\nthe ground, a crane carrying several\ntonnes of steel reinforcing rods accidentally put them through the window of a computer room in the\nChemistry building. Both Mr A. and\nMr B. told me with glee that there\nwere four people in the room at the\ntime, but I prefer Mr B's version\nwhere a student left his chair just a sorry if I slip into that sort of writing\nat any point. If that's what you'd pre- Secondly, anyone watching the top\nfer, however, then try humming the of the main library over the summer\nold 'Top of the pops' theme as you will have seen two mini-doze rs, read the next section... being used for clearing the roof in\npreparation for the two new 'green-Firstly, some facts about the house' glass-clad storeys. Not to be\nlargest of the two cranes on the BMS outdone by the cranes, one of the\nbuilding construction site... It's61 doze rs was moving debris when the\nmeters tall, it's stabilised by blocks roof beneath it partially gave way,\nof concrete weighing a total of 100 dropping large chunks of concrete\ntonnes, it's provided by a company into the library below. According to\ncalled Hewden Stuart, and over the Mr A, the doze r itself very nearly fol-FELIX FRIDAY KITH OCTOBER NEWS FEATURE 9\nmore than ABC.\nfew seconds before the space above it\nwas filled with steel. Did I mention\nwho provided the cranes? Oh yes... It\nwas Hewden Stuart.\nThe final blunder you should\nalready be familiar with; namely the\ndeciduous concrete above the walkway outside the library. This gets top\nbilling because it was the nearest we\ngot to actually killing anybody. After\nlast week's somewhat hurried report,\nI can now confirm that no-one was\ninjured, everyone involved has\ncalmed down and that the collapse\nwas probably caused by the wrong\ngauge of steel reinforcement having\nbeen used in the roof. According to\nIan Gillet, the Health and Safety\nExecutive have been informed, but\ndon't appear to be planning an investigation. Both conspirators admitted that\nthis was the incident that had spurred\nthem into speaking out. Mr A. com-men ted: \"The odds are stacking up\nagainst them... I know they're working in a crowded environment but if\nincidents and accidents continue at\nthis rate, somebody's going to get\nseriously hurt.\"\nMr B. added \"I think that a lot of\npeople in the college are very wor-ried... there are serious accidents\nwaiting to happen.\"\nThat's as far as they would go,\nleaving me with only one option...\nMy notes prepared and ready for a fight, I nervously dialled the number\nI had been given for the mysterious\nMr C. Ian Caldwell's secretary\nanswered;\n\"He's on site at the moment. Why\ndon't you call back tomorrow?\"\nCall back I did. Several times in\nfact. Charming and patient though\nshe was, the director of Estates' secretary was unable to bring him to the\nphone. Her responses to my frequent\ncalls included:\n\"He's in a meeting.\"\n\"He's still in a meeting; his meetings are stacking up.\" [presumably\nlike planes at Heathrow.]\n\"He's just disappeared into Suite\nFive.\" [the rector's offices.]\n\"I don't know where he is... I suppose that's not a very good thing for\na secretary to say, really.\" And final-ly, with genuine concern:\nchance to reply... maybe he really is\nthat busy. The point of this article is\nnot to make College's director of\nThe proposed library extension will be permanently\nconcealed by the cunning use of trees.\n\"Sorry... I'm beginning to think\nhe's hiding from me.\"\nTrue, I ought to have persisted, and\nit isn't fair to criticise the elusive Mr\nCaldwell without giving him a Estates the scapegoat for student\ngripes, as has been a trend for Felix\nin the recent past. In fact, Both Mr A. and Mr B. expressed fullest confidence in the College administration.\nThis isn't particularly that surprising\n'The fourth incident is\nrapidly becoming an IC\nlegend.'\nPeople that build greenhouses shouldn't throw stones.\nconsidering they're both part of it,\nbut remember; the information they\ngave was freely volunteered.\nMr A. refused to be drawn as to\nwho was responsible for the problems, But Mr B. had no hesitation in\nlaying the blame firmly at the feet of\nthe contractors:\n\"Schal [the main contractors for\nthe works] are charging IC the top\nrate, and they are a top company, but\nthe site helmets I 've seen are a dead\ngive-away that cheaper firms are\nbeing used for much of the labour.\"\nHe explained that Schal Construction\nManagement use different sub-con-tractors for the different aspects of\nthe work... These sub-contractors\nthen use a variety of smaller firms,\nwhich in turn employ agencies who\nactually hire the site workers. By the\ntime the agencies, smaller firms, sub-contractors and Schal have creamed\noff their profit, the College is not getting value for money. In addition,\nalthough College's Finance division\nperforms credit checks to protect IC\nin the case of a contractor going out\nof business, some of these smaller\nfirms may be extremely prone to\nbankruptcy, especially over the duration of large projects such as the\nCampus Renaissance. Mr B. also\nwarned that, as a result of this hierarchy, there were breakdowns of communication and \"...a prevalence of\nlower-end labour.\" Thus, no matter\nhow hard College (or indeed Schal)\ntry to maintain safety standards, accidents will continue to happen...\nI called Schal Construction\nManagement twice on two different\nnumbers, pretending to be two different people, but was twice referred\nback to Estates division. As a result,\nI have no reply from them to the\ncomments made by Messrs. A and B. Nor do I have any real confirmation\nof the incidents they describe. So\nwho do we believe? And who has the\npower to improve the safety of our\ncampus?\nMr Caldwell is 41, but his secretary was unable to confirm this.\n\n"
