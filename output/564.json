From the first kick it was\nobviously going to be an easy game for IC.\nMost of the team seemed to feel the same\nway, as they promptly missed six easy\nchances in the opening minutes. Finally,\nDave Dean put IC ahead after fifteen minutes\nand this was followed by a penalty, awarded\nfor a trip on James Rowley, converted by Kev\nReeve. Dan Dean made it 3-0 before half-time.\nIn the second half, IC decided to feel sorry\nfor their opponents and only managed one\ngoal, a thirty yard effort from Ged Elliot, who\nthus proved the law of averages! Meanwhile,\nJames Rowley had been continuing his non-scoring efforts with two shots that hit the bar\nand, at the centre of the defence, Steve and\nPhil seemed to keep themselves amused!\nTEAM: Smirnoff, Reeve, Smith, Mulhall,\nWard, Dick, Elliott, Ryan, Dean, Hartland and\nRowley.\nFootball Seconds\nON AN excellent pitch, IC started their league\nprogramme against this newly promoted side\nwith a resounding victory.\nIC quickly took a firm grip on the game and\nthe pressure applied to the rickety LH\ndefence resulted in several free kicks around\ntheir penalty area. The first half ended at 4-0\nto IC with Veenman (2), Carr and Armstrong\nsupplying the goals.\nThe opposition's 'electric' defence, which\nseemed to have developed a short circuit\nmeant that the goals continued to flow freely\nin the second half. Bateson made forceful\nforward runs and was unlucky not to have his\ndive in the penalty area noticed by a rather\ndoze y referee. With the LH attack now non-existent, the defence were free to attack at\nwill; both MacDonald and Curran putting\ntheir names on the score sheet.\nAt 10-0 the opposition were looking\ndistinctly disinterested, and some turned to\nkicking our players instead of the ball, in the\nvain hope of enlisting some more patients. A good overall performance was finished by a powerful header from Carr. The complete list\nof second half scorers was: Saunders (3),\nCarr (3), MacDonald, Niccolls and Curran.\nTEAM: Veats, Curran, Beer, MacDonald,\nBateson, Clarke, Niccolls, Armstrong, Carr,\nVeenman (Merritt), Saunders.\nFootball Thirds\nIN THE first half of, what proved to be a highly entertaining game, the fifths rock-like\ndefence of Brown in goal and back four,\nTeahan, Cable, Lay and Gohil dealt with\neverything, the thirds attack could produce.\nJust after half-time the fifths went a goal\nbehind to a well-taken opportunist effort by\nWiggins.\nAs the saying goes: \"When the going gets\ntough; the tough get going\"; so it proved with\nthe fifths. Finding themselves a goal behind\nfor the second week running they moved up a gear into overdrive to produce one of the\nfinest comebacks.\nThe equal ising goal came from an own\ngoal, and with the thirds now on the rack the\nfifths started to turn the screw. Both Morris\nand Archer had shots cleared off the line\nbefore Baldwin disposed a thirds defender on\nthe edge of the box and thumped the ball past\nthe despairing keeper. The third killer goal\nwas added soon after, when Audin's deep\ncross from the right wing left Healy with the\nsimple task of slotting the ball home.\nThis set the seal on what was a fine fifth\nteam result demonstrating the incredible\nspirit which has already developed within the\nteam.\nA particular mention must go to Dave\nHardy and Kev Teahan who were both\nplaying in their first fifth team game and gave\nexcellent debut performances.\nTEAM: Brown, Teahan, Gohil, Cable, Lay,\nMorris, Archer, Kelly, Healy, Baldwin, and\nHardy. With Audin as sub.\nMany thanks to Al's girlfriend for coming to\ncheer the fifths to another emphatic victory.\nFootball Fourths\nRIGHT from the start of the game IC had an\nedge over QEC in all areas of play and soon\nstarted to pressurize the QEC goal. With less\nthan ten minutes gone, IC suffered a setback\nwhen centre-forward, Burns, had to le ve the\npitch with an ankle injury. This did not effect\nIC's domination of the game and they took\nthe lead soon after when McNicholas turned\nin a hard low cross from Maddy. IC\ncontinued the pressure, with any QE C breaks being easily handled by the defence\nQEC held out the IC attack until Richy Dolan\nscored a brilliant individual goal beating\nseveral QEC players before prodding the ball\nunder the advancing keeper to make it 2-0.\nIn the second half QEC put up a better fight\nand had much more possession of the ball. It\nwas after a spell of QMC pressure that IC\nscored their third goal with a sudden break\nout from defence which allowed McNicholas\nto go clear on the right and chip the ball to\nKev Buckley who turned the ball in at the near\npost.\nThere were many attacks and several\nnarrow misses before Graves got clear of the\ndefence and side-footed past the keeper from\nthe edge of the box to score the fourth goal.\nTEAM: Williams, Berns, Maddy, Flanagan,\nChown, Dolan, Hunter, Buckley, Burns,\nMcNicholas, Williams J, and Graves.\nFootball Sixths\nIC SIXTHS cruised to their second victory in\nfour days with a polished performance\nagainst the School of Oriental and African\nStudies.\nAt first the game was very evenly balanced\nand very few chances were created by either\nside, however, gradually IC began to threaten\nthe SOAS goal more f re qu net ly. IC scored\nafter twenty minutes following a corner that\nPage 10 FELIX, October 24, 1980\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Sir\nICS F Soc balls up. The IC Science Fiction Society film on Tuesday, October9, made a loss\noi' approximately23 p. The maximum estimate of the audience was about one hundred. Significantly, nobody walked out until the end. Only seventy two people joined the society before6:30 pm. Jonathan Flint, the man responsible, was in Stan's Bar afterwards. When asked what could be done about the high attendance, he answered:\" I don't know what to do....I think I'll resign\". Mark Jeff cock, the SF Soc Treasurer, made a spot decision to keep the admission fee exactly the same, in a last ditch attempt to reduce the audience.S oIC SF Soc made a loss on the film of23 p consisting of16 p for i he film itself,\n3 pon carriage,3 pon VAT, and1 p for doormen, and of course, the cost of publicity. SO WHY DIDN'T WE GET A HEADLINE? Yours blatantly,\nTelephone Bill and the Hamiltonian Operators PS: You can headline this ' TC SF Soc Piss All Over Opposition\" if you like. Dear Steve\nSince we do not think that the point was made clear enough in your frontpage story last week, may we take the opportunity of reminding IC students that the( unsuccessful to say the least) No Dice concert was in noway the responsibility of the I CENTS Committee. ENTS members were asked to help on the night.\nSomething which we did as a personal favour to John Passmore( and would do it again, if the occasion arose). As the minutes of our previous meetings show, this\nis as far as ENTS involvement in the gig went. Incidentally, the last concert staged by ENTS was the Blues Band one. which was ver v successful. The ENTS Committee Dear Sir\nI must say I was rather taken a back at the hysterical reaction from Ham soc, provoked by my small ad in FELIX562. Obviously the opening phrase was designed to get attention, rather than being an aim of the Club. Let me take this opportunity to explain exactly what is going on in this country with regard to CB Radio. In spite of being technical l) illegal, there are an estimated100,000 CBe rs in the country, and I have spoken to at least 2 0\nin my hometown, working only aten mile radius. There is no doubt that CB will be legal in this country within a couple of years, and it is very likely that27 MHz will be the frequency used. Even if a different frequency is proposed, it will be very difficult to control the vast numbers of pirate sets in the country already. Talking about frequency, there is a lot of rubbish talked about interference. Radio control models and radio paging systems are on iy affected by the use of channel16( out of40) and most CB users shun this channel lor this reason. We do have some measure of responsibility! By the way, radio mode ller s may not know it yet, but they will be asked to move up to32 or35 MHz within a couple of years to be inline with the rest of Europe. The use of CB radio cannot be compared to the activities of Ham soc. The appeal of CB is\nshort range casual communication, requiring no training, no examination, no licence, no technical knowledge, no formality( compare callsign s:' Ferret' as\nagainst' G4C TP') and very little expense \u2014 a good CB set can be had lor as much as a car stereo radio. Ido not propose to explain just\nhow CBc an be used to benefit the community, but if there is\nanybody wanting more information on CB may I recommend the magazine Breaker ( Link House Publications,80 p,W H Smiths) as being a very good publication, setting out fairly all sides of the entire argument. I use CB as a simple form of free speech. Ido not want to talk to other countries, but rather to be sure of avoiding traffic jams, getting in touch with friends, and generally as a casual means of communication. Catch you on the flip. The Ferret\n( Real name and address supplied.) Dear Sir\nMercy' s Sake s! Some people really want to dominate the radio waves. I refer of course to the letter from HAM SOC last week. A cursory glance at the radio frequency spectrum will show the masses of space allocated to HAM. All CBe rs want is a tiny-jot on the spectrum. To suggest that joining HAM SOC will provide the type of enjoyment one gets from aCB set is quite ridiculous. CB is a short range( about ten miles) mobile contact system, which allows drivers to contact each other lor traffic information, assistance, etc. Absolutely no illegal activity will be carried out in the name ol Imperial College Union. If aCB Club is formed, it will be a purely social club to help campaign nationally for the legal is ation of27 MHz CB radio. Anyway, there are many national organisations campaigning for the legal is ation of a whole range of activities, some of which ICU has affiliated to in the past. HAM SOC claim not to be opposed to' open channel'. This is a euphemism lora ridiculous exercise suggested by the Home Office which will mean having to pay prohibitive amounts for a set,\nand this system is clearly unacceptable to the majority of CB enthusiasts today. Finally, illegal CB operators are certainly not bringing amateur radio into disrepute. They have been of invaluable service to the Police in the past in tracing getaway cars, etc. Witness the number of Chief Constables in the past few months that have openly stated that their men are not going to be involved in chasing up CB users.\n/ have the honour to remain. Sir,\nyour most obedient and obsequious\nservant,\nShl omo Gods iMan Sci PG Sir\nI read with interest in last\nweek's FELIX article on HAM SOC, that\" negotiations are currently underway to have the Union Building mounted on a large rotator\". I hope this does nothing to effect the position of the I CW A Lounge. Patrick Coll Maths1 Dear Sir\nI think it is a shame that Sandra O' Sullivan has resigned as I CW A President, as she was the only member of the committee who had any contact with, or cared about, the women of College. Her attitude is shared by a large number of IC WA's nominal members, and most of its other' members' don't care at all. It is hardly surprising that I CW A has not had a quo rate meeting for years. If I CW A consisted only of those people who wanted to be in it, they should have no trouble in getting20% of their members to a meeting.(20% is very low for a quorum anyway \u2014 all ol Councils other subcommittees have much higher quorums.) I CW A have frequently proved that they are incapable of changing it, and will be for as long as all the women of College are automatically members. I CW A is\nincapable of either representing women, or of integrating them socially( which they are supposed to do, according to their constitution). In fact, its attempted activities would seem to be detrimental to the integration of women \u2014 why should women lock themselves into a ghetto somewhere in the Union every lunchtime, anyway? Moving the lounge may have upset six or so\nwomen( and it can't have had much effect on Snooker Club, as\nthat room has always been used), but it has been very beneficial to the many clubs and societies who now use the Upper Lounge. Why should I CW A, which has a smaller active membership than any other society, have a room ol its own anyway? Last year, they frequently met in the Maths Common Room, which shows it\ncan be done. Why can' tIC WA book a room, like any other society( and most societies have to book two or three weeks in advance to get a room at all). Mr Marshall objects to John Passmore' throwing \u00a3 5 0 0 of Union money down the drain'( FELIX, no'563). but that is\nprecisely what happens to the \u00a3 5 0 0 given to I CW A \u2014 it is used by even less people than came to the No Dice concert. Fiona Sinclair Maths3 Sir\nIn reply to the letter in last\nweek's edition of FELIX from Mess rs Chell, Cavanagh, and Curry, I feel that I must come to the defence of their colleague and cohabit ant.I can assure them that his persistent absence from their illustrious company has been for a noble cause. I can reveal that he has been taking a course in' The Practical Applications of Biology' at night school, and is indeed excelling in this subject. In learning how to produce the pure, chaste, upstanding. Christian citizens of the future he is ensuring the continued survival of our species and should be congratulated on his responsible attitude. Yours faithfully\nHis Biology Teacher Page 2 FELIX, October 24, 1980\n\n"

    "content": "broke loose from a mass of players allowing\nChamberlain to put the ball in from close\nrange. Following the goal, SOAS launched a series of attacks on the IC goal but could not\nbreak through the tight marking and tackling\nof Davies, Higham and Barton, ably backed\nup by composed sweeper, Nagle. Although,\non the defensive, IC counterattacked well,\nand, on one of these occasions, IC forced a corner. Sean Davis floated the ball across the\narea enabling Mike Roache to rise above the\ndefence and head the ball down for John\nChamberlain to slot in his second goal.\nAlthough IC were two up the game continued\nto be very even up until half-time.\nThe second half started similarly to the first\nhalf with both sides creating few chances, but\nas SOAS pushed more men forward they left\ngaps at the back and, following one of the\nmany good moves on the left initiated by\nSteve Davies and Liam Gartside, John\nChamberlain crossed the ball for Sean Davis\nto score.\nWith ten minutes left Christov Caseau came\non for Dick Tangier. IC still had their work cut\nout as the opposition pressed forward. SOAS\nvery nearly got a goal when their forward\nappeared to outrun Dave Bradley (probably a trick of the light) but the ever alert Neil\nHampton raced off his line to make a brave\nsave at the oncoming forwards' feet. SOAS hit\nthe post in the closing minutes, but IC held on\nto gain a creditable win.\nTEAM: Hampton, Higham, Bradman,\nNagle, Davies, Tinkler, Clegg, Gartside,\nDavis, Roache and Chamberlain.\nD Tinkler\nRugby Firsts\nAFTER a scenic two hour tour of London, we\nfinally arrived at Q MC's ground near\nBrentwood. The match kicked off at 3:15pm in brilliant sunshine, with both sides looking\nvery pretty in their new strips.\nIt took a few minutes for IC to get going,\nbut it was soon evident that our pack would\noverpower QMC's. Our first try came after\nsome tentative handling in the backs finally\nallowed George Chan on the wing to go on a dazzling run, only to be tripped near the line\nand be awarded a penalty try. From this point\non, the backs gained in confidence and with\nplenty of ball provided from set pieces, we\nbegan to pile on the points. Tries came from\nChan (2), Johnston (2), Davies, Manzoni,\nAustin and amazingly 2 conversions from\nMorgan.\nThe 'Random line out thrower award' goes\nto A Lorans with the much coveted 'extra\nfullback' award going to R Smart (Capt).\nAll together this was an encouraging match\nfor IC who are still trying to find the best\ncombination before the Guteridge Cup.\nTEAM: Pullen, Davies, U Narbro, Morgan,\nFazacarli, Paixao, Chan, Johnston, Austin,\nStear, Smart (Capt), Warby, Richards, Lorans\nand Manzoni.\nRCS Hockey\nNEGLECTING all thought of pulling off\nanother series of convincing cancellations,\nRCS produced a team, an umpire, seven\nshirts and a gritty performance against one fo\nlast year's top teams. Any question of RCS\nwinning points by luck were dispelled by this\nperformance. RCS scored first with a dazzling\nrun from the half-way line by Farrington, but\nQMC hit back swiftly to lead 2-1 at half-time.\nIn the second half, a short corner led to a mad scramble by the somewhat shaky QMC\ndefence and Mike Cope forced the ball home.\nAnother piece of scrappy defending saw the\nball come to Cope again and RCS were\nlooking for their first league win for more than\na year. However, they were denied by a late\ngoal from QMC. On this performance Gordon\nBaxter wouldn't even get to be 15th man.\nRobyn\nSnooker\nSaturday, October 18\nRugby\nIC1s tX VIC2 nd XV Football\nI C1st XI Hockey\nI C1st XII C2 nd XII C3 rd XI\nv PoliceD Division89 v PoliceS Division04 v King sv Met Police. v Mill Hill\nv Saints11012110 Football Firsts\nTHE FIRSTS made hard work of their match\non Saturday. The side had been reshuffled\ndue to injury and the 'unavoidable' absence of\nSteve Ward! IC found themselves 1-0 behind\nat half-time following a medico re first half. In\nthe closing stages of the game, Hartland\nstabbed the ball home follow ng good work by\nElliott. Still looking for a win, IC Pushed\nfo ward again and won a corner on the left. A deep far post cross found Mulhall rising like a salmon to connect firmly with the ball... and\nsend it flying over the bar!\nTEAM: Smirnoff, Curran, Smith, Reeve,\nMulhall, Elliott, Bateson, Ryan, Dean,\nHartland and Rowley.\nHockey Firsts\nAFTER the euphoria of last week's victory\nover a weakened Birkbeck side, we at last\nsettled to our usual losing ways.\nWith or without the influence of certain star\nplayers we played like idiots. Yes, we have to\nadmit it, we were hopeless and the score line of 0-1 really flattered us; we should have been\ncreamed. Never mind there's always next\nweek. Perhaps we can lose more impressively\nthen.\nTEAM: Butler, Crowe, Riley, Davey,\nHughes, Barry, Ayres, Coatesworth, Rao,\nRich, Bell and Gatley.\nHockey Thirds\nTHE THIRDS won for the first time this\nseason despite having two goalkeepers\nplaying outfield and an outfield player\nmasquerading as a goalkeeper. The Old\nCreightonians, with their high level of\nindividual skill, provided very strong\nopposition.\nThe first half was goalless with both sides\nmissing scoring opportunities. IC failed to\nconvert several good chances, both from attacking moves and penalty corners whilst the\nOld Creightonians failed to capital is e on two\ncrosses that split the IC defence, and an\nexcellent chance when the goalkeeper was\nleft bemused at one post, as the ball passed\njust outside the other.\nIC took the lead early in the second half from\na penalty corner. Dave Cornwell hammering a shot low into the corner of the net. Old\nCreightonians were kept out by some solid\ndefending and were unlucky (?-Ed) to be\ndenied two penalty strokes. One when an IC\ndefender submitted to his goal keeping instincts and kicked the ball away, the other\nwhen out keeper 'accidentally' body checked\nan advancing player.\nThe game was hard, but played in good\nspirit with the final score reflecting IC's slightly better team play.\nTEAM: Hutchings, Sawers, Leinster, Pound,\nWebb. Cliff, Cornwell, Taylor, Wylie, Morgan,\nMitchell and Shaw (umpire).\nOVER twenty-nine people entered this year's Freshers' Tournament, the highest since the\nlast one. The eventual winner was C Gallagher and runner-up Lindsey Hancox.\nDrinks were kindly donated by the finalists,\nafter gentle persuasion by Mr President, to\neveryone present.\nThe league started last Wednesday and we\nare ready to defend our hard-earned title of\nlast year, during which we beat all opposition.\nCricket\nImperial College CC v Magdala CC\nIndoor 6-a side Knockout Competition at\nLords\nARRIVING his usual one minute late the\nCaptain's appear n ce only just prevented Mr\nSimpkin from conceding the match, so\ndistraught was he at the thought of playing\nwithout such a devastating bowler.\nAfter making the usual excuses about\ntubes, etc., the toss was lost and IC forced to\nfield. Mr Ellacott not wishing to disappoint Mr\nSimpkin, preceded to open the bowling with\nMr Silva. Having got his obligatory couple of\nleg side wide s out of the way, Mr Ellacott\nconceded only 12 runs off his 3 overs with Mr\nSilva, although conceding 23 runs, bowling a Maiden Over, which is quite an achievement\nin an indoor game where 10 runs per over is\nconsidered an average run rate. Then further\ntight bowling from Mr Simpkin (16 runs) and\nMr Tear (19 runs) and some sharp fielding,\nlimited Magdala to a mere 79 runs in their 12\novers.\nThe usual practise when in such a commanding position (especially in ULU Cup\nmatches) is for the IC batsmen to try and out\ndo the opponents and get an even more\nridiculous score. But on this occasion tradition was broken. Messrs Simpkin and\nWhite opened with such aggression and\ntiming that they were hardly recognisable as\nIC batsmen. Soon Mr Simpkin reached 26 and\nhad to retire having passed 25 and Mr White\nwas caught out for 20. But Messrs Clarke and\nSilva proceeded to score at twice the required\nrate scoring 24no and 10no respectively.\nThe Magdala score was soon passed in\nonly the sixth over when Mr Clarke despatched\nthe ball for six over the bowler's head, thus\njust about making up for dropping the easiest\ncatch ever given at Lords, off the bowling of\nMr Ellacott.\nTennis\nHOPE everyone heard about the meeting and\nfound the room. A fairly good attendance\nwith about 50 people. Points raised included\nthe fact that the discount arranged with\nDrobny's is no more, so don't use them!\nA Round Robin tour n amant has been\narranged for this and next term.

On Monday, RCS again\nmade their presence felt by patrolling the area around Sherfield.\nAs Spanner and Bolt arrived\nthere was a small commotion outside the \u2022Sherfield Building. Jud Cole, of Guilds, who was\nseparated from the mascot by a set of swing doors, lept into action and with great force succeeded in passing through the\ndoors by breaking the glass.\nUnconcerned that blood was\ndripping from his hand, Jud ran\non to protect the mascot. Jud proudly commented: \"Before the\nbroken glass had hit the floor, I'd rushed across to open the other\ndoors for Spanner and Bolt\". After the mascot was safely in\nplace, at the Ci vEng dinner, Jud went to St Stephen's Hospital\nand eight stitches were used to\nsew up his hand. Our FELIX photographer was standing next\nto Jud at the moment the glass\nshattered and he explained that\nJud pushed the large glass section\nof the door with his hand. The door should have opened normally, but Jud used too much force. There were many students\nnear the incident, but fortunately\nno one else was hurt.\nGet ahead!\nGet a copy\nof the new\nIC Rag Mag\nfrom the\nUnion Office\nOnly 30p!!!!!!!!!!U!

Most buildings were back to normal on Saturday. On April,30,1980, College produced a new scheme whereby lower manning levels were maintained. Messengers were reduced from47 to36 and security guards from58 to48. They were offered a20% rise\nfrom December3,1979 to June1,1980, plus5% from June1. The security staff claimed that the20% was long overdue anyway and felt it was unfair to connect it\nto the lower manning levels. College saves a substantial amount of money due to the lower manning levels. Con Is e que ntl y, the messengers/ security guards asked for a15% increase backdated to June1. The overtime ban has failed to produce the desired results they have now accepted the initial5% offer plus a \u00a315 bonus. Yalta\nvs\nKhan?\nTHE PEACEFUL seeming plot of land opposite the Victoria and Albert Museum is in fact the focus of intriguing controversy. The adjacent site is being used by Cass on Condor to build the \u00a36mAga Khan Cultural Centre. It is proposed to use the triangle of Crown land in question to build a memorial to those repatriated to Stalin' s Russia under the Yalta agreement. The plan is for a water sculpture designed by sculptress Angela Conner, com misi one d by a group including senior MPs from all parties and eminent public figures. The group is led by Conservative MP, Sir Bernard Braine, who described the Yalta agreement as a\" monstrous and gigantic tragedy, largely concealed from Parliament\". Initially the scheme was opposed by the Foreign Office, who wanted it moved off Crown Land. This idea was overruled by the PrimeMinister. Cass on Condor then took an interest. Obviously, neither they, nor the Aga Khan's agents wanted a political monument placed on what amounts to the same site as a cultural centre. Sir Neville Condor told the Sunday Times:\n\" My clients don't really want it\nright outside their building, though they didn't raise their voice at all, on our advice. They regard themselves as guests in this country and want to be good neighbours. We were building our clients' place long before there was any talk of the memorial and had notions of what contribution we might make to the memorial site, which is a public garden\". The Royal Fine Arts Commission made a more vigorous objection advising Kensington and Chelsea Council that after consultation they could not recommend the plans. Despite this the Council gave planning permission and work on the memorial is to proceed. Micro Club saved!\nA MOTION was received lor the UG Mon October28 concerned with the abolition of the Microcomputer Club. The Executive decided that the motion was unconstitutional and have not included it in the Agenda printed in Exec News for the U GM. The reason that the motion is unconstitutional is that clubs or societies can only be abolished if they have ceased to function or are proved to be detrimental to the majority of the student body. Bert and Beryl's Bus\nON MONDAY afternoon a1927 Hestair-Dennis open-topped\ndouble-decker bus left IC bound for the dreaming spires of\nOxford. On board were members of the Industrial Society, as well\nas the driver and his wife, Bert and Beryl Blower of Islington.\nWe attracted the attention of many pedestrians as we rattled down High St Kensington, not least that of a small boy who jumped on and asked the fare\nthe Transport Museum. On to the A40, a brief stop to take on supplies at the Acton Coop, and then through the Hanger Lane Gyratory System,( all at the stately speed of 1 5 mph), and we were on our way. The rest of our five hour journey was pleasantly passed eating high protein foods such as peanuts and chocolate, and drinking coffee in an effort to keep warm. Driving down the leafy lanes of Oxfordshire, one member, entirely carried away by the beauty of the scenery, very nearly lost his head to the lower branches of a passing beech tree.\nWe arrived in Oxford just after 7 : 0 0 pm and stopped at the Gate Hotel. Revived by hot drinks( Irish coffee) we decided to have a quick meal. Confronted by an extensive menu we chose Merton mouth fulls, Corpus cri spies and Magdalene munchies. From there to Trinity College where we were welcomed by the Oxford Industrial Society, and heard Sir Alex Jar rat, Chairman of Reed International, speak. His talk covered many areas, including government policy and nationalism, but particularly interesting to us was his prediction of a sharp increase in GDP in1982. After a glass of port and a brief word with Sir Alex were turned to London by BR. FELIX, October 24, 1980 Page 5\n\n"

He's not even treated us\nto one of his a pol gies. As his apology passed through virtually\nunnoticed at Council, I feel that he owes some\nsort of explanation to the UGM.

Last weeks he excelled herself.\nEach orchestra member received a letter from her to the effect that the next rehearsal would be on Monday at 8 : 0 0 pm in the Great Hall, but as we were going to play music by Faure, the brass would not be needed. This was followed by no less than four letters, each offering apologies and corrections, and summarised as follows:\nTuesday at 7 : 0 0 pm in the Music Room, to play Poulenc; brass needed.\nWednesday at 5 : 3 0 pm in the Great Hall, to play Sibelius; brass needed. Thursday at 5 : 3 0 pm in the Great Hall, to play Shostakovich; brass needed.\nFriday at 7 : 0 0 pm in the Consort Gallery, to play Sibelius; brass not needed.\nEventually, I resorted to asking the conductor, who whimsically told me that each of the five letters was correct in just two of its five details.\nSo\" when, where, what and with whom is the next orchestra rehearsal? Solutions, comments and criticisms to me c/o FELIX Office. There will be a prize of \u00a3 2 for the first correct solution opened at noon on Tuesday. Last Week's Solution\nTen. Everyone in the network makes calls to one other person, and receives calls from at least one person, so each caller is part of a cycle of callers,\nwhose members all phone the next in the cycle.

Since all the cycles can exist together, the maximum number of callers is\nten.\nTo show these are the only possible cycles, observe that after scrambling any number, the remaining digits are either9,9,9, X,9X or9, X,8X,Y,10 Y; then examine all thirty cases.\nThe previous week's solution was misprinted in last week's FELIX.

The standard of living of our pensioners and disabled makes me ashamed of having been a politician for22 years and Is hare the blame for having done so much wrong. We' ve over nationalised, overspent, over regulated.... all with the best of intentions.\"\" The way to reduce poverty is\nto allow private enterprise to be competitive. You cannot have freedom without free enterprise.\"\" As an extreme case there is a broadly capitalist society with all its imperfections next door to a broadly socialist society and they are divided by a wall. If today the Berlin Wall was demolished, which way would the ordinary man and woman go? West to Capitalism or East to Socialism?.... I rest my case.\" Sir Keith then answered many questions from Imperial College students. One asked,\" Could you please explain tome the rights of the2 million unemployed?\" Sir Keith replied,\" He' s free to take work and price himself into a job. Do you think that Union rules l about wage rates and about pace of work, where they still apply, in fact price some people out of jobs.\" Another popular topic was that of interest rates. Sir Keith gave usa lesson.\" Interest rates are where they are because they are at the level that supply and demand fixes. It isn't the government fixing interest rates we limp after the market. We do say ML R should be so and so.... we don't pick a figure out of the air. We choose the figure that people are prepared to lend money at. You must realise that with inflation still at151/2% an interest rate of16% gives1/2% only in real return to the lender.\" No real profit in British\nindustry\nSir Keith shocked his audience by saying,\" There' s practically no real profit in British Industry today. If you takeout the oil, the banks and insurance, most manufacturing industry is working on average at nil profit.\" Sir Keith Joseph agreed with Colin Palmer, last year's FELIX Editor, that it would be a good idea to abolish the National Insurance Surcharge. However, he stressed that to remove it\nwould cost \u00a3 3 , 0 0 0 million. Len Irani, considering the C ND Rally next Sunday, asked,\" In these times of economic crisis how can the government justify investing \u00a3 5 , 0 0 0 million on nuclear missiles when it should be invested in industry.\" Sir Keith' s short reply was,\" Because the risk of not having the deter rant far exceeds the cost of having it.\"( Wow!-Ed)\nMark Clegg thanks all members of ConS oc who helped make the meeting such a success.

    "content": "FELIX Feature Article\nJust where will all the Union's money come from next year?\nby John Passmorc\nIN FEBRUARY of this year Mark Carlisle, the Minister\nof State at the Department of Education and Science,\nstated in Parliament that in order to reduce the \"open-ended ness\" of the present system of Student Union\nFinancing, and to make students' unions \"publicly\naccountable\" for the money they spend, they will in\nfuture receive a \"one part block grant\" from the parent\ninstitution instead of receiving \"per capita\" payments\nfrom the individual Local Education Authorities (LEAs)\nthat pay for that student's grant.\nSince February, the National Union of Students has been trying to get further clarification from the DES of their proposals. As yet, the DES has not been very responsive \u2014 in fact, the latest DES brainchild only came to light alter the' interception\" of a circular from the DES to the Council of Local Education Authorities! The latest proposals, so far as can be elucidated, involve increasing the tuition fees of each student in the country by a\" nominal\" sum of, \u00a332 to\nlake account of student unions' subscriptions. However, apart from the\nludicrous method of calculation( as explained below), there would appear to be a more devastating effect of lumping union lees with tuition fees.\nAlthough the proposals resulted from recommendations made by the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee to the DES and are not intended as an attack on the financial and political autonomy ol students' unions per se, the net result will be that officially student unions will cease\nto exist.\nIn this feature, John Passmore looks into the background and the nature and probable effects of the new proposals; setting the scene for the forthcoming U GM debate on Student Union Financing\nThe History\nUp until1979/80 session, Imperial College Union always received its grant from College, essentially from the University C rants Commission's block grant to College. Most other universities in the . United Kingdom have charged an annual subscription for students' union membership in addition to the tuition fee (the \" per capita\" system) so that, in effect, the students' unions received their money from public accounts but were not accountable to the public purse as how these funds were used.\nLast year, IC Union approached College with a view to changing to\nthe \" per capita\" system as this\nwould benefit both the College and the L'n ion financially( see later).\nCollege agreed to this.\nVarious governments have been on cern ed about the amount ol money going to students' unions for\nMime time. In1971. Margaret Thatcher, as Minister ol Education, proposed that Registrars be employed to oversee students' union spending. In 1978, the DES proposed a\" two tier\" system whereby the major portion of students' union's income would be derived via College recurrent grants from the\nUGC, supplemented by a low subscription payable by local authorities in addition to tuition lees. At the time, IC Union supported this scheme as giving additional autonomy as we were totally College financed then and would have stood to benefit. However, these proposals were never implemented. Following the change of Government and the subsequent\" Education Cuts\", the Ln ion decided that\nit would benefit both the College and the Union if we( hanged to a\" per capita\" system. Before College had agreed. Mark Carlisle, the Secretary ol State for Education and Science made the following announcement:\"/ hate decided to make a fundamental change in the Jmancing of\nstudents' unions commencing with the\nacademic year 1981182. Instead of fees\nbeing paid through the Student Awards\nSystem, 1 intend that unions should he\nfinanced out of institutions' recurrent\nfunds.\"\nCollege then agreed thai we should lie financed by the\" per capita\" system for 1 9 8 0 / 1 as they would not have gained in 1981 \"2.\nwhen the new system would be\nintroduced. The net expenditure lor1980/1 was estimated b v the Union to be \u00a3 \\ 6 9 . 6 2 9 . This works out at approximately \u00a339 per capita. Coupled with other income from the Bookshop, Life Memberships, Bookings, etc.. the total Union budget lor this v ear is about \u00a3190,000.\nThe Crunch\nThe DES have a ppi rent ly altered their plans yet again. Their new proposals have not been made official but were leaked to NUS two weeks ago. It was thought that\nall students' unions' mon ev would come from the UGC( the system we used to be on). This is not the case.\nThe DES propose that \u00a332 will be added to tuition fees to cover the\npayment of Union fees. However, to quote them, the DES stress:\n\" that this is an arrangement simply to provide the necessary\nadjustments of funds available to\ninstitutions at a national planning level: it is not intended to influence the way in which funds are allocated to individual institutions\". The^32 is expected to provide the same level of funds as is given under the present system. The figure of \u00a332 was calculated by adding up all the funds given to\nstudents' unions in1976/7 and adding9% per annum for 1977 8,\n1 9 7 8 / 9 , and for 1 9 7 9 / 8 0 (9% is the\nincrease the DES advised the UGC to add lor1978/9 and1979/80. There was no advice in 1 9 7 7 / 8 . )\nHaving taken this total( \u00a316m) the DES divided it by the total anticipated number of full time university and advanced further education students and surprise, surprise, up pops the magical figure\nof X'32. This is the average fee. The DES, in their infinite wisdom, recognise the fact that some unions have more facilities than others( especially university unions) when compared to those in the public sector. So just to remedy this la et and correct the imbalance, money will be transferred from the Rate Support Grant( the major part of a Local Authority's income) to the UGC who will pass the money on to the individual institutions. The figure currently being quoted is\n\u00a32.1 m. However, if we' consider Sheffield University with a current per capita of \u00a3 7 0 , \u00b0 ne sixth of the\n\u00a32. lm could go to them. How much would the other colleges get?\nJust to rub salt into the wounds. I he DES will remove all mention of a students' union lee from the award so il a parent organisation does not wish to give money to its\nstudents' union lor any reason whatsoever, then it is under no obligation to do so.\nHow the system\nmight work\nNormally IC Union submits estimates in February and negotiates with College for the grant required. Now we will negotiate wii h College and the estimate will be included with the college estimate to the UGC. They will consider the tuition fee income and any money transferred from the\nRate Support Grant to the UGC and will then make an allocation. How soon that estimate has to be prepared remains to be seen.\nHow Student Unions\nare affected\nThe absence of any earmarking lor students' union funds challenges the very existence of unions. Under the new proposals, the students' union will be competing lorin come with departments, libraries, services, etc., and in el lect with other unions at a national level.\nUnions may have to comply with UGC regulations which state what money can and cannot be spent on. Also, it may be possible for the\nLIG C to claim profits that Unions make on services as they can argue that it is originally Government money. How IC is affected\nThis depends on College. If we get\na Hat \u00a332 per capita we would lose\napproximately \u00a3 3 0 . 0 0 0 on present student numbers. However, since we have been on a block grant from College until last academic year, we should be better oil as College may supplement our income. II not\nil will affect all of us; clubs, societies, CC Us, sports, facilities,\nand any central union activity as\nwell as services provided, such as\nFELIX, IC Radio. Everyone's budgets will have to be cut. What we can do\nToday( Friday) Iam seeing the\nRector to clarify the position within College and the results of that meeting will be reported at the\nU GM. If the DES proposals arc accepted they will all ect all oi us so\nwe must be prepared to organise ourselves, to write to and lobby MPs, contact LEAs and gain support from College and bodies such as the CY CP and UGC. As Sean Costello. the General Secretary of LSO has said:\"/ don't care who is in or out of . \\ IS or I. SO.\nThis affects everyone\".\nAlter seeing the Rector. I will be\nbringing forward proposals on the\nissue. See you at the U GM, Tuesday. October28,1:00 pm, in\nthe Great Hall. Page 4 FEUX, October 24, 1980\n\n"

We feel that this letter is attempting to discredit \u2014 to quote\" their misguided friend\" and render his reputation to the disgraceful level of their reputations. The exploits of the three disreputable authors of the letter( especially those of one of them) are surely well known to all of us, and never was the description\" pure, chaste, upstanding Christian citizens\" so inappropriately applied to anyone.\" Their misguided friend\" however appears to all of us to fit this description admirably. We suggest that any further attempts to discredit this honourable guy should be ignored.

They arranged the trip for some of us overseas students at the invitation of the Essex branch of the Victoria League. The same thanks should goto Lady Binney and other members of the Victoria League, Essex branch for all that marvellous entertainment they gave us. The trip was quite enjoyable and it quite well achieved its\npurpose \u2014 to meet the English people in their English homes. Apparently, everything was English \u2014 mou strap cheese, delicious apple pie pudding very much unlike that in Southside \u2022 Refectory, Chinese and Indian tea( believe it or not!) and last\nbut not least, rain! The list is not exhaustive because of space considerations. Surely the Kensington Committee is doing a great job for us overseas students.

The method of payment was rearranged and this year the nursery is still lull with awaiting list. I have had noone approach me about the cost, although a few people have been awarded a hardship concession. Now, does this mean that people are quite happy to pay this much( admittedly for a good service)? Fine, well the the case is put on ice.

After\nall, it is their organisation.\nI presume that they realise that the present\ncommittee are only acting because insufficient\npeople are concerned enough to get off their\nbacksides and ratify them. Do they realise that an\nacting committee cannot be forced to do anything\nfor them?\nI wonder also how many PGs are aware of the\nnew security arrangements which are about to\ncome into force. If they can't be bothered with\none side of PG Group, then this matter will\nprobably concern them. However, unless a concerted body of opinion can be put forward on\nthe matter, they may find themselves being\nlocked out of departments at all sorts of\ninconvenient times.\nCollege Security are in the process of installing\n'card key' access points to the departmental\nbuildings.

I hope, however, that they will realise that they too\nhave a part of play in dragging people along to\nmeetings, otherwise nothing will get done; PGs\nwill have no voice and they will be trodden on\neven harder \u2014 or maybe that's what they want.\nGraham Green\nChem PG\nMatters Raised\nLost! \u00a310,000 worth of pots\nThat was the amount lost in 1978/9 in glasses,\ncrockery and cutlery \"disappearing\" from\nrefectories and bars.

    "content": "Review\nSugar and Spice\nBy lan Morse\nIT'S UNFORTUNATE, not least for Toyah Wilcox, that comparisons have lately been mooted concerning the said fem in it e and Coventry belle\nHa7p| O' Conner. The fact is that Toy al Willcox is a good actress,\nample evidence being her performance in Derek Jar man's Tempest, and is a far more viable proposition in this context than when she tramps the boards of some musical passion pit and gowns the person a of yet another rock' n' roll screams ter. The least said of Mis sO' Conner s prowess in both\n\u2022 art forms the better.\nThis being the case, it must be said she's done herself very few favours in taking on a role in Nigel Williams' new hackneyed melodrama at the Royal Court. At first, she appears to be on safe ground, playing Sharon, a butch feminist punk et te, acting as verbal overlord to a company of assorted adolescents, gathered for a late night whiskey\nsession at the tacky Kings Road Council flat (?) of thrice married Suze, an aging tart who can't escape her own lust for prolonged youth and attempts, not too successfully, to befriend the\nteenagers. Things get more interesting with the\narrival of Steve, would be flash mod, who' s followed the girls to the flat in an attempt to pocket\none of their number. Sharon then proceeds to give\nthe lad the proverbial hard time, s trio nine him of ego and clothing with a sustained volley of abuse,\nthe first act ending with her preparing to cut off his\nballs with a bottle of Bells.\nGiven that the plot is maybe a little trite, the\ngood performances of Willcox and, particularly, Carole Hay man, as the hopeless Suze, gives reason\nto expect something a little more substantial to\nhappen in round two. Unfortunately, with the arrival on the scene of the oppressed lad's cocksure mate, the storyline\ntakes an even more predictable turn, ending up with the new hard man humi latin g one of the girls\nand eventually falling out with the pal he had not\nlong before made Gala had ian attempts to rescue.\nThe play peters out into dumb and predictable oblivion. I'm told, all Nigel Williams' plays are irritatingly similar. If you' ve seen and enjoyed one of his previous numbers, the nId are say you' ll get\nsomething from this. It runs until mid November, and at only \u00a3 1 student standby is the cheapest play\nin London.

Sites in Berkshire and Cambridgeshire\nwere chosen on June 17. This came in addition to the\ndecision to develop \u00a35billion of Trident missiles this\nJune.\nCruise missiles will be in Britain by 1983. They will be\npaid for by, and under the control of, America, and\nrepresent another huge step in the arms race, a step\ntowards nuclear war. Cruise is not aN A TO equivalent of\na Warsaw Pact weapon; it is a totally new missile,\ncapable of 'cruising' at low level and high speed under the\nrange of radar. This is on top of aN A TO superiority in\nnuclear weapons, 7668 to 6000. Britain is the major\nEuropean nuclear base of NATO; a tiny island with\nindustry and people concentrated in a few areas. In the\nevent of a nuclear war involving America and the Soviet\nUnion, Britain will be a prime target and will be\ndestroyed. Home Office reports expect 35 million people\nto die, probably an underestimate.\nThe concept of Soviet Union superiority is a myth.\nWhile the Warsaw Pact has a vast superiority of\nnumbers in conventional forces, its army is composed of\nmany different races, many of them antagonistic to the\nSoviet Union, and much of its equipment is old. The\nstandard Soviet tank is the T62, built in the 1960s, and\nthe other Warsaw Pact countries use tanks built in the\n1940s as their standard weapon. Put bluntly, the Warsaw\nPact has superiority of quantity but not quality. NATO forces are well trained and equipped with the most\nmodern weapons. Senator Nino Pasti, a from er Deputy\nSupreme Allied Commander of NATO, has said: \"The\ntruth is that NATO forces, both conventional and\nnuclear, are stronger than those of the Warsaw Pact\".\nConferences on arms limitations have failed, and will\nfail again due to the mutual paranoia and fear of America\nand the Soviet Union. Meanwhile both countries indulge\nin aggressive posturing and a dangerous game of\nbrinkmanship. It is time Britain took a lead in breaking\nout of the mutual fear that is leading us to war and\ncommenced nuclear disarmament. Renouncing the arms\nrace is not simply a pacifist option, it is a call to break out\nof the never ending cycle of re-arming bred by mistrust, it\nis a positive action to show Britain is prepared to not only\ntalk about disarmament, but practise it as well. It is not\neven an option, it is a necessity; we are moving towards a war that will destroy European civilisation. It is quite\nsimply a case of 'protest and su vive'. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament is organising\na national demonstration against nuclear weapons this\nSunday from Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square. If you\nshare our concern at the warmongering of America and\nSoviet Union and the rising numbers of nuclear\nweapons, don't simply grumble, stand up for what you\nbelieve in.

Six students eventually gathered under the aegis\nof Simon Chandler, of the IC Red Cross Group, and then marched south in a disorderly fashion t q Fulham Road. Pausing only for two members of the group to devour large current buns, we formulated a plan for crossing the road whilst\nsimultaneously avoiding a lion, a bear and a wolf\ncollecting for charity on the other side. ( The plan failed \u2014 but we still arrived safely at the Ellesmere Home for elderly people.) We were admitted, and stood in an embarrassed huddle in the entrance hall for a while as the victims prepared themselves for an afternoon out. At last, for c if i ed by a tune on the rest home piano by Xavier, five brave residences entrusted themselves to our care and we boarded the VW minibus hired for the purpose. Lurching off at a huge velocity we proceeded through London in the( very) general direction of the Tower. The O APs lost no time in pointing out how much they liked a pint, but the hint was ignored as the bus swept along the London streets past Buckingham Palace and along theM all, Strand, Fleet Street to St Paul's Cathedral. All the way they provided a mass of information on the city, aided and abetted by the vol u able driver. We crossed the river at London Bridge, then back by Tower Bridge, and threaded our way west \u2014 passing the Guildhall, Bank of England, and Smithfield. But an hour was left as we swung into Kensington Palace( either hitting or narrowly missing a surprised pedestrian). We pro ceded another six feet and were halted by a scruffy\nlook in official who told us where togo, to get to the palace. With a cheery wave we turned about and left him, retracing our steps to the correct entrance. Disgorging ourselves from the bus, we entered the building, and five minutes later (the Red Cross having taken care of the entrance charges), we tackled the stairs, which were of unusual dimensions and became most tricky going down. At the top of the steps, separating into groups of two or three, and following the\" this way\" signs,\nthe party scattered over the dozen or so rooms on show to the public. Until about half three, the small parties toured the area and eventually descended the way they\nhad come \u2014 lured by the threat of missing their\ntea if they were too late back to the nursing home. Thus by4:00 pm the minibus was again parked outside Elle s more and both students and pensioners hopped out. Liberal thanks and farewells were offered by the young to the old and viceversa, and whilst they had declined an offer\nto drop into hall for a\" baked beans on toast\"s upper some night, a promise was made to organise another trip.\nAll things said and done, we were safely tucked up back at College again by5 o'clc ok. For very little effort the si x of us had been given a free tour of London and Kensington Palace( and hints on cooking salmon) with five of the friend list travel guides possible, and a driver who added a little of the James Bond touch to the whole affair. What was more important, the five folks we'd taken with us enjoyed themselves just as much. If anyone would be interested in this sort of\nthing, it's quite possible more will be organised, so please contact: Simon Chandler, Maths2 or the Red Cross Group at IC.
