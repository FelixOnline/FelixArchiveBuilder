The Executive Can\narrange to Ban anything - even lectures\nif you decide that you dislike them!\nMembers of I. C.W. A. Are you aware\nthat one of your most enterprising\nexperiments in recent years ha a failed?\nYour Mr. I.C. W.A.is planning to send\nin hi a resignation, before your next\ngeneral meeting be o a use he feels that he\nis unable to please you all. Congratulations to John Bell on his\nrecent engagement and to \"Oggi\" on\ngaining his Ph.D.A series was started in Phoenix last\nyear entitled \"They o a me to Imperial\".\nIn the coming Xmas issue of Phoenix a new series to be commenced under the\ntitle \"They left Imperial\" in wh i oh the\nlife of a recently well self-pub lio is ed student will be reviewed.\nSpectators at the recent Mines Dept.\nSnd Year and 3rd Year Soccer mato h decided that it was perhaps his excess\nVteight that prevented the referee,\nRichard Garaett, from keeping up with\nShe ball. On visiting the College\ndoctor on the following day, however,\nR.H. T. learnt that he was suffering\nfrom lumbago. His colleague Mr. Ewart,\nhas been heard to warn him that the\nstage is gout and then thrombosis.\nSVtfliViMlNG\nLast Friday the o lub swam and played\npolo against Q.M. C, The swimmers were\noverwhelmed, I.C. being unable to win a single event. The polo would not have\ntaken place if it had not been for A. Eylea, who shinned precariously up to\nthe roof on a rope to free a jammed net.\nI.C. won the polo after a hard struggle\nby 2 goals to 1. However Q.M. C. were\nunable to score after I.C's Capt. was\nordered out of the water during the\nsecond half. The 3rd team fought well\nto beat Morphy-Riohards W5. SKIING\nThe photograph shows John Pearce\non the Hahnenkamn,Kitzbuhel,Auatria,\nafter only ten days experience with\nlast years party at Kits*\nThe I.C. party to Saas Fee this\nyear ia now full,but there are many\nothers that are not yet complete,inc-lu ding trips to Saalbach in Austria,\nand Leysin and Saas Fee (at Christmas\nin Switzerland,where there is already\ngood ski-ing snow.\nA SOCCER MATCH\nAt 2.30 p.m. on Sunday the 29th November a football match took place\nbetween the seco nu and third year Miners\nin Hyde Park. Many spectators\ngathered during the course of the game,\nand were treated to a display of soccer\nthat kept them in fits of laughter for\nover an hour. Contributory factors\nwere several. First of all there was\nthe fact that the larger part of both\nteams was made up of rug ger, and not\nsoccer players, then to help matters the\npitch was about two inches deep in mud,\nand finally there had been a small\nbirthday oe leb ration for Jack Mawdesley\nbefore the match.\nThe following is an unbiased account\nof the match offered by M.J. Matthews,\nI. Hill,E. Spursht, H. Howell and\nB. Hindley.\nAs the teams tottered on to the lush\nmud of Hyde Park Stadium it was obvious\nthat they were going to give a never-to-be forgotten display of soccer skills\nand sartorial styles. The teams,\nstaggering a little under the weight of\ntheir lunchtime refreshment, lined up\nwith roughly eleven on each side, a whistle was blown, and play commenced ....\nFor twenty minutes chaos reigned and\nMuddy Matthews raced from end to end\nexhorting his men to score in either goal\nand at the same time trying to avoid\nMopper Mawdesley, then ten minutes before\nhalf time it happened.\nSwivel-Hips Howard collected the\nball near the halfway line, beat five\nmen with one body-swerve, causing\nCreasem Creasey and Blotto Otto to\ncollide with a crash that shook the\nsurrounding buildings. Meanwhile a thirty yard trot took Swivel-Hips to the\noutside right position from where he\nslipped a pass to Suave Harv., who, after\na moment of indecision, accidentally got\nrid of the ball. The ball rebounded\nfrom defender to defender and finally\na Charlton-like shot from ace inside far-ward Deadly Hedley screamed inside the\npost to oom e to rest some two feet over\nthe line. At this point the goalie\nLeave-it-to-ms Longden, emerged from the\nmud and appealed for offside. The\nreferee, Gorgeous Garnett (dressed in\nParis suede shoe3 and Portobello Road\ntrousers) made his one correct decision\nof the afternoon and allowed the goal.\nWith the halftime score at 1-0,\nboth teams having had a quick drag and\na pep talk from their many supporters\nwhose comments were as follows\"???*'.!!\nyou shower\", Mines 2 continued the\nslaughter. They put two more goals in\nthe net but both were disallowed by the\nref. who, finding himself unable to keep\nup with the play, and being an honest man,\noo ul d not allow goals he did not see.\nHowever, the play was not all with\nMines 2; after a scintillating run,\nBookie Banks cracked in a shot which the\nimpregnable T. Caddy palmed round the\npost for a corner. Creasem Creasy\ncurved the ball into the goal mouth from\nthe resulting corner and T. Caddy made\nhis one mistake of the mato h in fending\noff the goalpost as well as the ball.\nWhilst Mines 2 were appealing for a foul\nand Mines 3 for a goal, Bookie Banks\nfound the ball at his feet and sent it rocketing towards goal. At this moment\nthe dazed goalie realising that he was\nnot permanently damaged, struggled to his\nfeet, and summing up the situation in an\ninstant, grabbed the ball and grovelled\nwith it in his usual inimitable manner\nin the mud.\nCROSS COUNTRY\nOn Wednesday 25th. November the\nsecond team were hosts to teams from\nUniversity College,Kings College,\nRoyal Veterinary College, and the\nLsndon School of Economics, in. a match in t ne \u00a3nd Division of the London\nLeague. They won by a very wide margin,\nindividual honours going to Paul Auton\nwho was first. Ed. Bennett ran well\nto finish third while the unpredictable\nGeorge Turner, who was not nominated for\nthe team, but took part, ran a blinder\nand finished fourth.\nOn the following Saturday the\nfirst team were the guests of Lloyds\nBank and ran over a course at Hayes in Kent, while the second team travelled out\nto Coxtie Green in Essex to run against\nQueen Mary College and Goldsmiths College.\nAt Hayes, good packing by the I.C. men.\nwho occupied all positions from 3 to 10,\nwon the day. Old man Silly, who has\non numerous occasions threatened to\nretire, ran as usual and finished 10th. At Coxtie Green the second team defeated\ntheir opponents in spite of all but\none of the scoring runners going off\ncourse. The man who knew the geography\nChris James, finished third, closely\nfollowed by Clare (5), Butler (6) and\nFearn (7).\nWednesday 2nd December 3\naW the\nfirst team travelling cut to Reading for\na match with the local University.\nThis was won by 62 pts. to 79 principally\ndue to the efforts of John -Collins (2)\nand Jim Bernard ( 3 ) .\nLast Saturday (5th Dec.) a first team rao e against Ranelagh Harriers and\nSouthampton University was combined with\na second team mato h against R. AiF.\nCranwell. The first team lost to\nRanelagh Harriers by two points but\ndefeated Southampton, while the second\nteam disgraced itself in losing to\nCranwell. The race was very fast and\nseveral personal records were broken by\nlarge margins. For the first team the\nace U.L. runners Barber and Cleator finished\nsecond and third respectively. First\nhome for the second team was D. Fearn\nably supported by C. James.\nFar a further ten minutes the two\nforward lines struggled manfully with the\nconditions, and suddenly Gorgeous Garnett\nfinding play within range of his whistle,\nblew full time; the better team had won.\nNote: Allegations that the referee\nwas bribed are completely unfounded.\nThe Teams:\nMINES 2\n(points awarded for\nindividual skills in parentheses.)\nT.

    "content": "KPE 333\nAnd in this column, ladies and\ngentlemen, we have the slightly aged\nchairman of A.C.C. Fantastic?\nWell, not really. Randal is a very\ndiverse character, as any thumb o logi st will tell you immediately from the\nphotograph of his thumb which appears\nabove. His early history illustrates\nthis diversity. Born in England in\n'34, he lived in New Zealand until\n1940. From 1943 to 1952 he was at\nChrist's Hospital (School!).\nAfter which he did an apprenticeship with Ford's where he learnt a great deal about cars and a little about\nwomen. He then did his National\nService, obtained a Commission and went\nto Singapore with R.E. M.E. During\nhis stay, he spent three weeks playing\nrugby in Japan in a combined service\ntour (where he learnt a little more\nabout women). he then abandoned the\norient and came to Guilds. (Whew!) His\nability to run in a determined fashion\nwhilst carrying the little leather\nball, gained him a place in the I. C.1st Rugby team of which he was Captain\nin his 2nd Year. He is of a philosophic turn of mind, having lived\nnext door to Sydney Lenssen for two\nyears. Despite this mishap he is remarkably sane and balanced in out-look. He hopes to get a degree this\nyear and build a new oar. He still plays rug ger and finds time to keep\nthe A.C.C. in order, a no mean thing.\nThere is no information to hand\nabout his present contacts with the\nfair sex, except that such contacts\nare known to exist. The remainder\nof this profile has been censored.\nFELIX HOROLOGY\nHOW TO PLAY CHESSE\nChesse is a very interesting game\nand o an be played by simply anyone (or\nanyone simple). There are two par-tic ip les, one having White peace-types and the other having Black peace-types. White has nominally the\nfirst movement, and then they move in\nA.C. fashion.\nThe game is played on a squared\nboard of sixty four sau are lets by\neight, which are alternatively black-white-black etc. or white-black-white,\ndepending on the choice of coordinates.\nThere are two blasting directions,\ni. e.x and y hatchets. The ox hatchet\nis concerned with the ranks or sideways horizontals (horizons), whereas\nIntroduction:\nOn consultation of the possibility of buying a watch,this body decided\nto investigate analytically the claim of\na well-known firm of h oro logi sts that\ntheir timepiece made the journey from\nKing's Cross to Edinburgh attached to\nthe piston-rod of the Flying Scotsman,\nwithout detriment to itself or apparent\nharm to the engine attached thereto.\nAssumptions:\n(1) Speed of express train (by definition)\nya60 mph.\n(2) Diameter of Driving Wheel a2 yd s.( as for Charles I).(3) Piston Stroke = 26\" (Machine Drawing\nand Design by W. Abbot, p.87, pub.\nBlackie & Sons Ltd., London and Glasgow, 10/6d.) \u00ab 2r.(4) That the length of the connecting\nrod is long compared to that of the\ncrank.\n(5) That if and when you drop your watch\nyou drop it through a height of\n3 ft., and that as a result if it buries itself in the floor to a depth\nof 0.01\".\nCalculations:\nSpeed of train = 60 mph a88 ft/seo.\n.\n'\n. Angular Velocity of Driving s heels^ x2X=6X=4 p radians/sec.\n.\n*\n. Max. aoc el\"\" of piston = tt'r=f*x u=931 ft/sec\n\"\n- 29g.

A \u00bb - 112,320 ft/ seo\n= - 3,490g. Conclusions:\nThus it can be seen that whilst\nthe test oh the Flying Scotsman subjects\nthe watch to acceleration and deceleration equal to 29g., the dropping of a watch onto a fairly soft floor subjects\nthe poor beast to a deceleration of\n3,490g.,i.e.120 times as great, and\ndemonstrates the complete worthlessness\nof the test as far as the watch is con-cern ed, ii h&t effect it had on the carefully balanced reciprocating parts of\nthe locomotive we have been unable to\nascertain.\nA Cuckoo Clock was finally\npurchased.\nthe oyez hatchet is to do with files\n(fern, fillies), which are up and down\nvert i ou les.

    "content": "FELIX\nSQUASH\nAt the Clubs general meeting on 30th November the main item discussed was the\nexpansion programme and its effect on our\nSquash Courts, Professor Sparkes, who\ntook the on air gave a run. picture or the\nsituation. It apr ears that at the moment there, are no plans for any Squash\nCourts at Imperial College. The meeting agreed to the motion that a suitable\nletter on this matter be sent to the\nReotor at on oe. Ihe draw for the Whitley Cup is now\nposted in the Squash \"Courts. As there\nare exams at the beginning of next term,\nthe first and second rounds should be\nplayed by the term. Next Monday\nevening and Wednesday afternoon have been\nreserved by the Club for Whitley Cup\nmatches.\nThe 1stV suffered another heavy defeat 0 - 5 , this time by Clare College,\nCambridge. Will my match secretary\nplea a e put the Carnival dates into his\ndiary. However, we won away against\nUniversity College, thanks to a fine\neffort by ex-hockey player Robin Jowit,\nwho beat U.C.' s Captain 3 - 1 .\nThe 2nd V lost a good looking\nrecord last Wednesday when they met youth\nin the form of fips om College and a J5 defeat. In their present state I don't think the 1 stV would have done any be\nbetter but they have got the fixture in\nthe future.\nICWSC.\nHockey\nI.C. W.S.C. have failed to win this\nterm, and it has, as usual, been diff i cult to raise a team. However in the\nmatches we have r laye a it has been\nobvious that the excellent,defence has\nnot been backed up by the forward line.\nChris Braziel and Margit Zakarious\ndeserve particular mention as they have\nboth done a great deal to raise the\ngeneral standard of play. Chris, of\ncourse, plays for U.L. with Hilary\nTompsett. It is hoped that Capt. Ann\nHodnett has better luck with her team\nnext term.\nNetball\nChelsea Poly, can almost be rated\nas our \"home ground\" now. The team\nplays regularly down at Manresa Road,\nand we have had several close and\nexciting matches there.\nIt was obvious in our last game\nthat most of the team had been watching\nI.C. Rugby Club, and several Chelsea\ngirls seemed to be in danger of their\nlives. However they survived and lived\nto enjoy a very pleasant evening in I.C. Union.\nSquash\nThe squash team is undefeated this\nterm, and they chalked up a very fine\nwin over U.C. first team. A notable\naddition to the Club is Brenda Whyte,\naU.L. player, Katie can look forward\nto captaining an experienced team in\ntheir matches next term.\nBASKETBALL\nThe London Basketball League is accepted as the finest selection of\nteams in the country and with an extensive programme of netball as well as\nbasketball matches, the I.C. team\nbegan to wonder whether or not they had\nbitten off more than they could chew l The first game showed us that the\nstandard of play waa a great deal higher\nthan the University League and, although\nwe defeated Chelsea Central by 4 4 - 2 2 ,\nit was not quite as easy aa the score\nmight indicate. Pinsbury Park provided\neven stiffer opposition and it took the\nI.C. team quite a while to settle down\nto their usual game. It was not\nuntil the seo on d half that we finally\ngot on top to win by 53 - 4 5 .\nWith these two o lose matches behind us we then proceeded to hand out\nthrashings to Borough i toad, Huntingfield,\nand Kingston I. M.C.A. All these e ames showed that the basketball team, like\nmany other IC teams, are very slow at\nstarting and it was only by good seo on d \"half play that the results are so good.\nThe record to date was then played 5\nwon 5, hut the next game brought us up\nagainst Central Y.M.C.A. who were tipped\nto win the league this year. Playing\nat Central, one of the most spacious\ngyms in the country, it took longer than\nusual for the I.C. team to a ett le into\ntheir regular play and by that time\nCentral has almost taken command of the\ngame. However the I.C. team pressed\nhard and with defensive man Hind out-at and ing in attack (his variations of\nspeed and thrust left the Central te an leader rooted l)oa pta in Mike Barron,\nscored some'outstanding long shots so\nthat at half time we lagged by only\none point. A change of tactics by\nthe Central team in the second half\nresulted in the I.C. team being\npegged down, and the Central score\nbegan to mount. It was soon realised\nthat although their tactics meant\nthat set shots were out, some fine\npassing movements resulted in a dramatic\nreversal in the direction of the play.\nI. C.over bawled Central and with five\nminutes left held a lead of 3 points.\nNot deterred in any way Central\nfought back and managed to reduce the\narrears,,but we held on and finally won\nby 39 - 3 5 , a very commendable result,\nwhich puts us at the top of the division.\nInterspersed with these games we\nplayed five others in the University\nof London League, with only one\" defeat.\nThe last two matches are worthy of\nmention, not only because they were vic-to riou s, but because during the latter\nhalf of the first and the whole of\nthe second, the I.C. team played the\nbeat that they have ever played. The\nteam make up has changed little since\nlast year, the only notable addition\nbeing Mat Mathews who, in spite of his\nlack of inches, has scored many points.\nLast year's captain, Jack Fryer,\nwas not the prolific scorer of last\nseason, but instead has played the part\nof pass feeder to the rest of the team.\nResults to date:-London League\nChelsea Central\nFinsbury Park 'B' Borough Road\nHuntingfield\nKingston YMCA\nCentral YMCA\nPL League\nUniversity College\nChelsea\nBattersea\nNorthampton College\nNorthern Polyteehnio\nDivision II\n4 4 - 2 2\n5 3 - 45\n60-27\n57- 26\n5 8 - 21\n39-35\nDivision I3822644233425427773^ BADMINTON\nI am happy to report that the club\nhas continued its run of success since\nthe last issue of this revered news-paper. The second team has had two\ninteresting and closely fought matches,\nagainst Kings and the London Hospital\nMedical School both of wh i oh we won\nby the narrowest of margins , 5 rubbers\nto 4 .\nWe almost had to play the Hospital\ngame with a2 pair team,the sixth\nmember arrived very belatedly after\nwhat must have been a record breaking\ndash from Clapham to Whitechapel.\nThis could have been avoided if the people selected both to play and to a ot as\nreserves had kept a close eye on the\nNotice Board and crossed or ticked\noff at the appropriate time.\nThe Aings game, as always, was a closely fought affair in w n ich our\nsecond pair did very well to win all three rubbers. The first pair played\nprobably their best match of badminton\nof the season and after winning two rubbers conceded the final one, against\nKings l st pair, after a very even game.\nThe mixed side has won both of its games in the last fortnight and is functioning much better as a team than\nit did last season. As always the\nthree men are at least as good as the\nopposition. The difference lies in the\nfact that our ladies are now more exp-erie n ced^), and are not overawed by\nthe fact that they are playing in a match.\nDare I say that this may be the\nreason for the re-ascent of our badminton teams to their rightful place at\nthe top of the leagues, where they have\nnot been for some little time now.\nHOCKEY\nI. e.7L.S.E.2 This score indicates the run of\nplay in this 2nd round of the U.L. cup,\nthe I.C. forwards always pressing and\nthe occasional defensive error.\nThe match started off true cup style\nwith both teams fighting for the ball,\neach trying to draw first blood. It\nsoon became apparent that the lively I.C. forwards had the edge over ao umber some L.S.E. defence, and I.C. were awarded\na penalty bully for a kick on the goal-line, which Bhatragar converted.\nHowever, L.S.E. soon equalise d with\na goal from their left; this was unfortunate\nsince the ball was kicked into the I.C. circle.\nThe turning point of the match came\nwhen I.C. scored 3 goals in 15 minutes.\nFirst DeBrookert scored a magnificent\ngoal from the back of the circle with\na shot which rocketed into the top of\nthe net. Then Miller pushed the ball\nin during a goal mouth scramble. And\nagain DeBrockert scored with a nicely\nangled shot from the right.\nIn the second half, it was apparent\nthat it was only a matter of time with\nI.C. pressing hard and the L.S.E. defence\nhitting out. I.C. asserted their supremacy with 2 goals scored by the pre si3te nt King and I goal by lowell the I.C. centre\nhalf.\nThe L.S.E. centre forward, their\noutstanding player, scored a consolation\ngoal to make the final score.\nI.C.7L. S.E..2 Although I.C. are to be congratulated\non once again reaching the semi-final,\nthe missed chances of this match must\nbe goals scored against stronger\nopposition.\n\n"

Indeed, the\nbeard is usually regarded as a particularly close form of camouflage\nwh i oh is the greatest fundamental error\nin the 'lay' pub lio's beard wise think-ing. For whilst concealing the lower\nhalf of the face, it renders the whole\nof it immediately recognisable. Far\nfrom being the gesture of the recluse\nand the hermit, abandoning the ras or is an act calling for the strongest of\ncharacters, the bravest of men. Thus to\nstep out of line, to leave the oom mon herd, is to nail colours to the mast\nand stand by one's every deed. No\nmore o an the bearded one disappear into\nthe crowd - his reputation will stay\nwith him - the regretted deed can no\nmore be escaped. Imagine the copper's wry smile as the maiden says \"...and\nofficer, this man had brown hair and\nblue eyes ...\" BUT - picture the\nf re nay of file-searching at the Yard\nas the incriminating fact is revealed\n- \"The police are believed to be\nlooking for a bearded man.\"\nAnd we are not without distinguished support - the fabulous\n\"Bean\" Holbein (Hon. Sec. of the Old\nCentraliana) sports a growth that is an excellent example of this sort of\ntons or lal art. Dr. Toombs - late of\nthe Electrical Department and now moved\nwisely to be a vacuum cleaner tycoon -frightened would-be engineers with his\na gres sive hirsute appendage (endless\neuphemisms have been devised for this\nnatural phenomenon).. And we are not\nwithout our Royal Patronage .......\nPractical bint s to those intending\nto fallow the present trend might not\ncome amiss. There is no known fert-ili ser. Washing is not something to\nworry about unduly - the frequent\napplication of hot soup, black coffee\nand beer is usually sufficient to\nkeep the number of fauna down to\noom for table figures. Assymetry in the\ntrim should be suffered rather than\noar rect ed as the latter is likely to\nlead to the gradual depletion (known\nas \"whisker whittle\" - a trouble often\nencountered in ambitious barbers). And\nNEVER let a woman \"tidy it up\" -remember Solomon.\nTalking of women (subject normal)\n-the incidence of whisker has been\nstatistically proved to depend on a favourable attitude on the part of\nthe opposite sex. At the moment there\nis still a novelty value to the man\nwith a tas; an approach known as the\n\"I 've always wanted to try....\" At\nany rate - it is fair proof of.the\ngirl's depth of feeling (?).\nOn the question of style - those\nwho object to the wide range of shapes\nand sixes should take comfort from\nBottom in \"Midsummer Night's Dream\"s\"I will d is oh arge it in either your\nstraw-oo lou red beard, your orange tawny\nbeard, your purple in grain beard, or\nyour French-crown colour beard, your\nperfect yellow.\" ,\nanyway, Anne likes mine, Jack.\nCOMMUNITY\nDEVELOPMENT\nCommunity development has been\ndefined as: \"A movement designed to\npromote better living for the whole\ncommunity with the willing participation\nand on the initiative of the oom m unity*. People have, of o our se, been trying to\nimprove their own and other peoples'\nlives for many oen tu ries. The new things\nabout 'oom m unity development' are the\nstandardisation of technique a and the\ndeliberate and determined application of\nthese techniques as a matter of\ngovernment policy. As Mr. Kojo Batsio,\nMinister of Education s nd Social Welfare,\nin what was then the Gold Coast, said in1951: \"Community Development is an\nattack on ignorance, apart hy and prejudice\non poverty, disease and isolation - on all the difficulties wh i oh hinder the progress\nof a community. It is an education \u2022\u2022\u2022\ndesigned to teach people not merely how\nto read but how to live. Passive\nreception of ideals or information is not\nenough: every programme should be designed\nthrough the stimulation of initiative or...\nlocal self-help.\" One can imagine\nalmost the same words being used by Sir\nKeith Murray, International Chairman of\nW.U. S., to describe many of the aspects\nof World University Servioe; indeed the\nsame vital words, essential to both\norganisations, are used - self-help.\nJust how closely the two are linked\ntogether was going to be witnessed, and\nperhaps even determined, when over forty\nparticipants, from all over the world,\no a me together this Summer in West Africa,\nfinanced through the auspices of W.U. S. by Shell and other such firms.\nThe programme was divided into two\nparts, essentially a theoretical side,\nfollowed by practical experience, and as\nsuo hit was a Workshop Conference. The\nthe or ect ical side took the form of a conference held in Sierra Leone, organised\nby W.U. S. in conjunction with Fourah Bay\nCollege. Tt lasted a week and contained\na very full schedule of lectures,\naddresses and commission meetings.\nLeisure time was unfortunately limited,\nbut the many receptions given by neighbouring towns and villages as well as the\nGovernor's and Mayor's enabled one to\nmeet many people from all strata of life, and also see some of the crude beauty\nof this mountainous region. The latter\npart of the programme was in Ghana\nwhere W.U. S. with the help of the\nVoluntary Work Camps Association, Ghana,\norganised three work camps, each in a village between 100 and 200 miles from\nAccra.\nThe Workshop was not a complete\nsuccess - not all the participants-were\nhappy doing manual labour. These\npeople had been brought up with the idea\nthat m annual work was below the intellect-u al. Very few changed that outlook.\nThe schedule could have been bettered,\nfor the final evaluation was rather short,\nand the experience wh i oh followed the\nearly introductions at the conference\nwould have been more valuable if obtained earlier. We did, however,\nsee many of us left with a far deeper\nunderstanding of the simple words -self-help.\nSTOP PRESS\nLCWSCl I. CRFC. 3\nThe project tackled by the group\nof which I was a member was in Kikam, a small village by the sea, where we were\nto help build a market place. It is difficult to try and describe what\nhappened in the short fortnight we lived,\nslept and worked with these happy, and\nyet so primitive, villagers. One must\npicture a dusty collection of mud huts,\nwhose occupants busied themselves only\nwith the basic essentials of material\nneed, happy when the whole family unit,\nconsisting of three or four generations,\nis together and in good health. One o an catch a glimpse of this life, when one\no on side rs the fact that no-one has ever\nbeen known to steal anything in Kikam.\n\u2022With the encouragement of the Mass\nEducation Authorities, the Chief and\nhis Elders, and most important of all, the villagers, had decided that they\nwould be cleaner, more hy geni o and\noom for table than the dusty mud roads.\nThe market would also attract nearby\nvillagers to Kikam and they would bring,\nin turn, broader vision and understanding.\nIt was almost an attack on isolation.\nOur organised effort, starting at\n6,30 a.m. and continuing into the\nafternoon, was.the focal point, to the\nvillagers, at first of amusement and\nentertainment. It was new and almost\nunique to see white and black hands\ngrappling with the hard earth to set\nthe foundation of this project. But\nsoon they were with us, shoulder to\nshoulder, with their numbers vastly\nmultiplying the work done. The focal\npoint had switched to one of common\neffort, - this was Community Development.\nI should like to reo all two\nhappenings which illustrate some of the\ndifference between our societies, and\nbring back to me perhaps the happiest\nmoments of the past Summer. One day,\nseveral tons of sand were required for\nthe concrete floors and a promised\nlorry had failed to materialise. An\nElder called upon the women present to\ngo and bring their friends and their\ncooking pots and pans. Soon, there were\nsome 200 women gathered, gaily chattering,\nlaughing and joking, each with a large\nbowl on her head. Like an army of ants,\nthey moved to and fro from the beach to\nthe work site, a distance of over a quarter of a mile, and the sand was\nmoved before noon. On another occasion\nwe had to carry many concrete blocks\nmade previously by the villagers, to the\nsite. At first they were carried\nindividually, until, inspired by\nweariness, the students started a chain,\nshowing by example, how the blocks could\nbe moved without walking. Within\nseconds the villagers had joined, and\nthe blocks were swinging rhythmically\nalong the 100-yard chain, helped along\nby numerous oh ants and songs. After\nthat, no matter what had to be moved, no\nmatter how far it had to be f lio ved,a chain was formed, and a lilting melody\ncame forth.\nFELIX CONFIDENTIAL\nWe hear that a young ICWARIAN has\nbeen carrying a torch for a certain miner\nfor some time. May we wish her the\nbest of luo k. Another outbreak of s poo rt has been\nnoticed in the Electrical Engineering\nDepartment. Could this be due to those\nrenowned French sportsmen Amp, Ohm and\nErg?\nRecently the Union has been aware\nof a strange figure, to be seen creeping\nin and out of the snooker room. What\nhe does in there all day is a mystery.\nRumour -has it, that notwithstanding\nthe various factors concerned, a young\ngentleman of this Union, to the horror\nof his friends, has, so to speak, gone\nbonkers, as it were.

Few realise that be\nwas an amiable but unknown exchange\nteacher whom we: recruited an hour beforehand to fill a ghastly guest gap. A piano, a j bke from Dr. Raimes and a sweet\nKangella in the Bar convinced us. People\nwere nio er. What would you do if after\na concentrated, entrancing conversation\nwith professor Blackett you happened to\nglance round to find your other guest\nengaged in a Beer battle? Would you\nwalk out and cry duo k? or fall on your\nfork?\nI mya elf did none of these, for it was apparent that Professor Blaokettthe greatest scientist attending a Freshers' dinner - was revelling in it all.

President began\nan unusual evening.\nHowever Professor Porter did not\nthrow beer at Lady Anne Thome, nor did\nDr. Stephens pose as Charles Dickenb\n(these were confused rumours arising from\none of my many nightmares this Autumn).\nCongratulations go to Mr. Mooney\nwho did not put us on war rations and\nthe R.C.S. marr-who shielded entering guests\nfrom asua pio io us gorilla gang of doubt-full origin.

S. entered this festival in its traditional manner of not\nknowing whether to try to win or to give\nfresher s acting experience. Again\nfollowing precedent the cast was mainly\ncomposed of new members of the Society\nwho acquitted themselves very favourably\nunder the rather chaotic arrangements of\nhaving to rehearse in nearly every room\nin I.C. Union. Also, the discovery\nthat one costume had been left behind,\nand having to slap on make-up in terrific haste, were not conducive to calm nerves\non the night.\nThe play, a modern adaptation of\n\"Pseudolus\" by Plautus, was, while being\nvery original, rather difficult to stage\nconvincingly. It was mainly concerned\nwith the efforts of a slave (Pseudo.) to\nrecover his master's mistress from a fate worse than death with an army\ncaptain in foreign service. Unfortunatel y, much of the interesting vernacular\nw hio hI am assured exists in the original had to be toned down in translation. Pseudolus was played with great verve\nby Andrew Chalmers, under the handicap\nof a false potbelly and enormous\nbuilt out feet. Gillian Harrold, as\nthe brothel-keeper, coped well with a part w hio hI feel sure is far removed\nfrom her nature, managing very well a really vile Birmingham accent.\nAlso worthy of mention is Nigel King,\nwho brought the house down with his delightful playing of an effete young\nnobleman. The \"ladies of the house\",\nsurely the most thankless of parts, were\nplayed by Brenda Taplin, Rosemary Kerfoot\nand Beverley Bradford; who, I feel, had\na little difficulty in living' the part,\nfor which I would certainly not blame\nthem.\nThe stage manager was Chris Nicholas,\nunder whose commendably efficient direction all ran smoothly, once we got\non te the U.L.

However, the\nacoustics of the New Victoria left mu oh to be desired, for it spoilt the\neconomical and sensitive piano playing\nof John Lewis.

    "content": "nu x Dear Sir,\nLaat week I sent you a letter which\nyou did not publish* due to its disappearance from your letter-rank. I would\nlike, if I may Mr. Editor,to summarise\nsome of the points made in this letter,\n1. That no anonymous \"Viewpoint\" be\npublished in \"Felix\" because\na) an anonymous writer may lie and distort without fear,\nb) any writer's qualifications to write\non a particular subject should be\nknown.\n2. That both sides of controversial\nissues, raised in \"Felix\", should be\nargued in the same issue because\na) mud sticks, and lies and distortions\nare more easily exposed if replied\nto immediately,\nb)a Union meeting, an S. C.C. meeting\nor some other meeting may meet without its members having had an opportunity to read both points of view,\ne) common courtesy.\nUnfortunately, as you are aware Mr.\nEditor, this letter disappeared, only\nto reappear after \"Felix\" had gone to\nprint. In this same issue of \"Felix\"\nan extremely libellous and untruthful anonymous article appeared. Since\na fair number of people knew in\nadvance of my letter, and the anonymous\nViewpoint was concerned to insinuate\nagainst myself (and others), it does\nnot seem unreasonable to suspect that\nmy letter's disappearance, may not have\nbeen accidental.\nThe insinuations against myself\nI feel should be dealt with firstly at the next S. C.C. meeting so, for\nthe present, I will content myself with\nbut one comment. On the very same\nnotice on the Union Council* Notice\nBoard, wh i oh announced the proposed\nformation of a Marxist Forum, and wh i oh was referred to by your correspondent,\nthere also appeared the constitutionally\nnecessary list of supporting signatories wh i oh your anonymous writer implied\nwere non-existent. It seems diff i cult to believe that he (or she) o an, be such a liar and yet be a member of\nI.C. Union.\nl ours faithfully,\nJohn Cox\nPICCADILLY CIRCUS?\nDear Sir,\nI have observed of late many expanses of window less walls in the new\nblocKs under construction. .Might I asK what function these walls are going\nto serve and if there is any truth in\nthe rumour that \"the Great Little\nCigarette\" is going to be advert i aed( in neon lights) on the wall of the new\nPhysics block?\nIf there is any truth in this\nrumour, it has my blessings and those\nof many others. Since if this stretch\nof wall and the many other a which will soon abound in the new Imperial College\nare utilised to their best advantage\nUnion funds should increase by leaps\nand bounds.\nI therefore urge all Union\nofficials to contact the College authorities and the leading chewing-gum\nmanufacturers immediately in order that\nthe metamorphosis of I.C. should take\npla oe as soon as possible.\nBOYCOTT OR RESIGN\nDear Sir,\nAs you will know, Imperial College\nUnion today passed a resolution to boycott certain South African goods. I deplore this motion at the time and still do deplore it. As several people have\nsince told me that they were unable to\nunderstand the logic of my objection,\n(a by no means infrequent occurrence\nlately) I would like to repeat it here.\nI firmly believe that the way to\ncorrect erroneous and evil beliefs is by argument and discussion. We should\nuse the constitutional procedure available to us and try to apply pressure on\nour own government until they do this,\nrn the meantime I object to the method\nof holding a pistol, economic or other-wise, at someone's head, to make them\nchange their beliefs - even though I aa aware that they are not so scrupulous.\nBe that as it may,the point I wish\nto raise is as follows. The inference\nof the Union meeting is that if the\nUnion feels morally bound to follow\nthis o our se, then we, as loyal members,\nare surely bound to support it by\nfollowing the same course as individuals.\n(I gather that this was not intended by\nthe propose rs.)I, for the reasons\nexpressed above, have no intention a of\ndoing so.\nI am writing thi a only because I am a holder of an elected union office\nand on this o our se of action I CANNOT\nSUPPORT THE UNION AT ALL. In the circumstances, aa some people may consider\nthis to be one of the most important\nactions taken by the Union, I should,\nif the union as a whole considered my\nlack of support undesirable in a Union\nof floor, be reluctantly compelled to re-sign. - This situation will, however,\nI hope not occur.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn R. Loome.\nSCRUTINY\nDear Sir,\nYours faithfully,\nG.M. Harris\n(Civil 2)\nAs editor of Scrutiny I apologise,\nfirstly, for some technical errors in\nour pilot edition and, a e cond ly, for\ngiving some people misconceptions as to\nthe true colours of humanism. But let\nme emphasise that it was a pilot edition.\nI am, however, rather sorry that\nMr. Lewis should be so unwilling to hear\nthe other man's point of view, as to\naug ge st that Scrutiny should cease to\nbe published. Particularly ao as Mr.\nLewis has sent me, in my capacity aa\neditor of Scrutiny, a very interesting\nand reasonable letter. I had assumed\nthat this was meant for our next edition\nwh i oh will be appearing next term. I had planned to include Mr. Lewis'\nletter,and 1 shall still do so with his\npermission.\nI nave, in fact, enough material\nto produce a complete issue from the\nletters I have received. I feel that\nthis alone is sufficient justification\nfor assuming our pilot edition\nwas, by and large, a worth while venture.\nI am not afraid to hear Mr. Lewis'\ncriticism of Scrutiny: but I shall not\ncease to publish, on the advice of a gentleman who is proud to call himself bigoted and dogmatic.\nYoura sincerely,\nBob Finch\nWINETASTING- UGH \\\nDear Sir,\nOn Tuesday evening I had the\nunfortunate experience to attend a wine\ntasting society session at the college.\nThe Wine Tasting Society is ao\nshockingly run that the wine is passed\nin a small glass from person to person.\nTo taste the wine after other people,\nwho have already shaken, sniffed, and\nfinally mouthed the glass, is particularly disgusting.\nThe only people who truly taste the\nwine are the committee who, with\nremarkable audacity, s it apart from the\nother people present, making it a very\nun social occasion indeed.\nThe Imperial College, or should it be the School of Mines Wine Tasting\nSooiety, is an organised mockery of wine\ntasting.\nC.G. Davies (3rd Civil)\nDear Sir,\nOn behalf of the Imperial College\nVine Tasting Society Committee, we would\nlike to take this opportunity or thanking\nMr. Davies for his letter concerning the\nrunning of the Wine-testing Society and\nthe remarks contained therein. Hif\nsuggestions, however, are than that one\nmight expect from one who has attended\nonly one meeting for they illustrate an\nunfortunate lack of knowledge on the\nsubject of both wine-tasting and the\nfinances of Union Clubs and Societies.\nOne must at all times, strike a compromise between what ia to be desired\nand what can be afforded. For example\nthere have been attendances as high as 70\nat a meeting when 6 wines have been tasted,\nwith the result that 420 glasses would be\nnecessitated if each member were to have\nhis own personal \u00a3 dozen) a luxury far\nbeyond that wh i oh our finances will\nallow. On the other hand, we could supply\neach person with a bowl, water and small\ntowel, with which to remove the traces of\neach wine from the gla ee following a tasting. As for the \"shaken,sniffed, and\nfinally mouthed \"remark one can only say\nin reply that the whole of the wine industry\nfrom Oporto, through Bordeaux and Burgundy,\nand into Hungary must consist of some\nparticularly disgusting gentlemen.\nWe regret that Mr. Davie* objects to the\nfact that the Committee sit with the\nspeaker, but we would beg to point out\nthat someone has to be available to pour\nout the wines at a signal from the latter,\nand if he feels that, by their geographical\nposition in the room, the members of the\ncommittee are assisted in disposing of\nmore wine than he, then we regret that\nMr. Davies is sadly mistaken.\nTne Comalttea, therefore, would be\nonly too pleased to meet Mr. Davies\npersonally and endeavour to put some of\nhi a ideas on wine-tasting into practice,\naa I am only too sure last year's Committee\nwould have been, consisting aa it did almost entirely of Guildsmen, who, like\nMinesmen, are still members of imperial\nCollege Union.\nWe hope, therefore, that at future\nmeetings of the Wine-tasting Society,\nwe have the benefit of Mr. Davies' wide\nknowledge and experience in wine-tasting,\nrather than having to discuss matters of\ncommon interest with him in thi a rather\nlaborious and impersonal manner.\nTours faithfully,\nTne Committee of the Imperial\nCollege fine-tasting Society.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX SAILING\nAfter the somewhat disrupted start\nto the season the Sailing Club is once\nmore forging ahead. The Castaway's cup\nknock out competition, which was to\nhave been our real trial of strength,\nhad to be o a noel led owing to thick fog\nand since then we have been unable to\nget a full first team together.\nTwo of our first team are sailing\nregularly with the University seo on d team. These high demands on the\noo lle ge club's resources resulted in\nour having to field a team with only\none first team regular included to sail\nagainst a strong U.C.1 st team. I.C. lost the match by 38 points to 40j but\nthis result promised well for the\nsecond team match against L.S.E. last\nWednesday.\nThe match was sailed on a damp\nand rather dismal day but there was a pleasant breeze and I.C. sailed to\nvictory by 42i pta. to 33. The race\nwaa far from uneventful and near the\nfin i ah of the last race the I.C. captain, who was leading at the time,\nmet a gust of wind coming in the\nopposite direction and, together with\nboat and or ew, made a graceful exit\ninto the water. The next boat piled\nright on top and the third was lucky\nto escape'.\nI.C. is also doing very well in the\nUniversity points series and G.C. Taylor\nis leading the \"A\" points after two\nvery good races. Several other helmsmen\nare also doing well and we still have\na very good chance of winning both the\n\"A\" and the \"B\" points series.\nAt a general meeting of the club\non the 26th November Miss J. Kingston\nwas elected Hon. Secretary. We wish\nher the very best of luck and will try\nnot to work her too hard.\nGOLF\nThis week e aw the last of oar\nfixtures for this y \u00abar-a triangular\nmatch against Kings and U. Q. at\nHighgate.\nBoth Kings and U.C. fielded their\nstrongest teams and were too good\nfor our players who did well to take\ntheir opponents as far as they did.\nOur Scottish tour begins to take\nshape. All the Universities contacted\nhave replied and wish to have a match\nwith us. When they have arranged their\nchampionship our dates o an be fixed.\nThis is the first time any Golf tour has\nbeen arranged and I don't think any I.C. team has ever been as far North of the\nBorder before. I trust this new venture\nwill be a success.\nJUDO\nLast week we fought G.E.C. with a rather depleted team and after some\nspirited and closely fought contests\nlost three, drew one, and won one.\nThe first three men had to fight\nopponents at least one grade higher\nthan themselves and should have gained\nsome good experience, especially with\nthe quarterly grading s taking place\nnext week.\nAt the regional championships held\nat Liverpool last week-end, Shepherd\nfought his way into the English\nUniversities team and Butler was chosen\nas a reserve. We hope by next term\nto have our team back again at full strength and .will be glad to have\nJohn Bowles back on the mat again after\nbis long rest.\nSOCCER\nAs anticipated in earlier reports,\nthe soccer o lub is now beginning to show\nits true capabilities and results are\nimproving fast.\nThe 1st XI have really struck form\nin the last three games having scored 7\ngoals in each of them with only 2 goals\nagainst in all. Old Coifelans bad\nneither the fitness or skill to compete\nagainst a much improved 1st team and went\ndown 7-1. On Wednesday 2nd Dec. the\n1st really hit a peak and beat the then\nLeague leaders Goldsmiths by 7-1 also.\nThis form provided high hopes for the\nU.L. Seoond round Cup match against\nInstitute of Education on Dec.5th. Institute.although fighting hard all the\nway were outclassed however, and went\ndown 7-0 making the I.C. goal average\nin Cup games this year 14 for to 0 against.\nThe Cup team did not show their best form\nin this game tending to hang on to the\nball too much and not making enough use\nof their two very effective wingers.\nWelcome back ,incidentally to Colin\nCasemore up to his tricks again on the\nright wing. More calling for the ball\nand quicker moving both into the tackle\nand into position for a pass will be\nnecessary in the semi-final which will\nundoubtedly be our toughest mato h so far.\nThe 2nd XI are continuing their\ntriumphant way but only drawing 0-0 with\nU.C. in spite of being in command for\nthe whole 90 minutes. With a very\nstrong team on Deo. 5th they defeated\na gallant I.C.3 rd XI 6-0 in the League\nDivision I. The 3rd's unluckily have lost their\nlast two league games, the first to\nBattersea in spite of playing as well\nas ever they have done this season.\nThe next of o our se was to the 2nd's but George Webster tells me that he is\ndetermined to get his revenge on Deo.l6 th. The 4th XI are going great guns\nhaving beaten U.C.H.52 and Division\nleaders School of Pharmaoy by 8-2! However they managed to lose to a very\nstrong L.S.E. Ill(?) by 6-4 after being\n4-1 up at half-time. Brian Wheeler\nsuggests picking \"our Albert\" (Marshall)\nat left-half and left-wing and dispensing\nwith the winger altogether.\nMike Daroy 5th XI Captain is happy\nto be on the winning side at last and\nhaving beaten U.C.4 th in a league mato h43 the 5th celebrated with another win\nby 4-2 against Sun Life.\nTwo badly-needed league points we we picked up by the 6th XI against Battersea\non the 28th Nov. and having drawn 3-3\nwith Woolwich in a friendly they only\nlost 3-1 to Chelsea on Lec. 5th. This\nwas extremely creditable in that Chelsea's goal record in three league\ngames is34 for, to 4 against.\nThe 7th XI continue their incredible\nway having triumphantly lost two more\ngames. This must almost constitute a record for even an I.C.7 th team.\nPaul and his merry men are not dismayed\nhowever and to our perpetual amazement\nthe phoenix of glory and club spirit\ncontinually rises afresh from the ashes\nof defeat.\nRUGBY\nLast Saturday, December 5th, saw\nmost of the members of the club fit and\nplaying, in fao t seven and a half teams\nwere fielded wh i oh is the most the\nclub has achieved so far this season.\nWith the first and extra first XV'i away it was left to the five lower\nteams to hold the fort at h arlington. A strong A XV had a field day\nagainst a weakened Middlesex hospital\n3rd team to the tune of 37 to 0,\nthe game being unique in a number of\nways. IC scored three times in the\nfirst three minutes without a member of\nthe opposition touching the ball.\nOther notable features were four excellent tries by Bill Hendry on the right\nwing and a ome excellent second half\nplace kicking by Aivar Taurine.\nThe Extra A XV also played Middle^\nsex Hospital winning convincingly by\n28 to 0. They are beginning to have\nthe makings of a good team rather than\na collection of individuals.\nThe Bl XV lost 6 to 17 to a strong\nB0AC 1st XV, the game being marred by\nthe removal to hospital of their captain Dave Fitley with fairly severe\nfacial injuries.\nThe B2 XV, under \"Hanks\" spirited\nleadership, convincingly beat Osterley\nB by 21 to 6 and are now very mu oha team to take note of. The standard of\nrugby played by the lower teams is very\ngood and although they may have numerically low rating, that is only because\n15 people can play in a game.\n.The 1st XV affair at test combe Park resulted in a convincing win for\nI.C.11 to 3\u00ab This is certainly one\nof the best performances of the team\nthis season, since this was only the\nthird time that Westoombe Park have\nbeen beaten in several seasons.\nTABLE TENNIS\nMatches have been played regularly at the rate of about ip a week, with only\none or two hitches. The results however have not been very encouraging so\nfar, very few wins having been recorded.\nHowever plenty of practice is being had,\nthe room being in use most of the available time, and it is hoped that the\nsecond half-se s3ion will be more success-ful. . We would like to impress j ip on players the necessity for ticking off\nin plenty of time, the lower teams being\nparticularly at fault in this matter.\nAlso on December 5th was held the\nI.C. Soccer Club hop - undoubtedly\nthe most successful club hop of the year,\nthanks to the noble efforts of Malcolm\nCrawley, Steve Pick, George Webster,\nBrian Wheeler, Lawrie Austin, Chris\nRyan, John Priest, etc., etc., plus the\nappropriate girl friends of o our se. Our thanks are due to them all. The\ncoffee bar was so successful that a special hostel brew-up had to be produced at half-time to supplement the\nrapidly diminishing Mooney coffee.\nWith improving results, a hop and a few away trip st the spirit in the Club\nis on the up and up and providing it stays that way there need be no limit\nto our success.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD, Imperial College Union, S.W.7 Printed by WEST LONDON OFFSET CO., 307a Telephone Place, W.14 Tel.

Council, the Marxist\ngroup and the student populus in general, guns have been aimed my way.\nThe unfortunate cause of these volley's has been the anonymous article printed\nin the last edition under the name of\n\"Commentary\".\nI have always had a great belief in the idea of the freedom of the press.\nI also feel that \" Felix\"3 hou lc be in a position$ o publish the considered\nopinions of all students, but freedom\nof opinion should not be allowed to get\nso much out of hand that slan aeris al lowed to creep in. Perhaps in the\ncase of \"commentary\" this has been\nallowed to take place, and as a natural\nconsequence many people have been\noffended. To these people I should\nlike to offer my most sincere apology.\nMy only excuse for the error now is that it may have jolted some people out\nof their apathy toward Union Affairs. A situation, which I feel our\nanonymous author is quite in place to\nmention.\nYou will notice that this weeks\ncopy of Felix carries no edition of\n\"commentary\". This is because the\nwriter, (whoever he or she is) has\neither left the country, hibernated,\nrun out of ink or is just plain\nscared. If so, I hope that the\ncontroversy will make him all the more\nanxious to express his opinions.\nI write this article a it ting back\nin the Upper Lounge of the Union,\nknowing very happily, that as this is the last edition of Felix this term it will not be possible for any would be\n\"Cassandra\" to ruin my Christmas\nDinner, and in this mood I should like to take my leave of you for this term\nand year, wishing you, on behalf of\nmyself and the whole editorial staffa very Happy Christmas.\nCHRISTMAS GREETINGS\nte tter to the\nEditai\nPRESIDENT SPEAKS\nLear Sir,I would like publicly to lodge a complaint against certain of your\nactions as Editor of 'Felix\" in the\nlast issue.\nAn anonymous commentary on union\naffairs was published, which, although\ngrossly inaccurate factually, and chi l dish in its iaea s, was answered by myself in an article that was not printed.\nYou lacked, o ir, the courage to tell me\nthat my answer was not to be published,\nand led me to believe that it would.be.\nIt was not until the day of issue that\nI found that the article had been left out. However, the real complaint I have is that it was agreed long ago\nthat when any individual, (or individuals) was attacked in 'Felix\", he should\nhave the opportunity to reply in the\nsame issue.\nIt is Sir,your anonymous contrib-u tor's right, provided he is a member of\nthe Union, to write what he sees fit concerning Union affairs, and with\nthat I have no complaint. . might\nhave hoped, though, that an Editor whose\nEditorial pleaded for the University\noutlook would realise that free speech\nwas a prerequisite of such an outlook,\nwhich means all points of view being\nput.\nMay I in closing refer to two of\nthe statements in the offending\ncommentary.\nFirstly, the Union meeting was not\nin quo rate. and secondly, Council made a recommendation to the union meeting concerning the Carnival proceeds. The\nUnion then came to a decision. This is,, I believe, an infinitely better arrangement than Council making a decision and\nscarcely bothering to tell the Union.\nYours sincerely,\nLea Allen.\nPresident, I.C.U. CLOTH CAPS\nDear Sir, Although I usually find\" Felix\" enjoyable to read and reliable in its facts, I was horrified and deeply grieved\nto read the opening paragraph of \"The\nFlay1\ns the Thing\". The description of\nEngland's greatest county was typical of that uninformed view held by the\nbowler hatted, umbrella carrying members\nof the sprawling suburbia that stretches\nfrom the\" south coast to Birmingham.\nFor th o3e who would discover the\ntruth about \" cloth caps\", Ilk la' Moor,\nGordale Scar (which is in the limestone\narea of the dales), the 3ron te country,\nand the other attractions of this county,\nmay I recommend the I.C.I. H.G. Easter\nvacation tours. In fao t anyone who is interested in seeing the countryside by\nwalking, canoeing or cycling next Easter\nshould look at the \"Youth Hostel Group\"\nnotice board by the concert hail NOW as\nbookings have to be made early for the\nmore popular areas.\nYours etc.,\nRoger M. Henson.\nMARXISM REPLIES\nDear Sir,I am somewhat distressed Dy the tons\nused by the author of the \"Commentary\"\nin your last issue, with regard to\nthe Marxist sub t group of the Li tarar y and Debating Society. He states that\nthe group are an embarrassment not\nonly to the Sooiety but to the Union as\na whole, and should therefore not be\noficial ly recognised in any way. This\npoint of view seems to be symptomatic\nof an intolerance which is only too\ncommon in this country, an into ler ance towards any point of view that\nis not considered \"respectable\".\nLondon University is the home of\nan vigorous an atmosphere of self expression a3 can be found anywhere in the world. Racial, religious or\npolitical intolerance is almost non-axis tsn t, and, far from being an em b \u2014\naras s ment, the presence of extreme\nelements is considered a source of pride,\nan indication of the diversity of opinion among students and of their zeal for expressing it. Thus it is a sad thing\nthat the Li tarar y and Debating Society\nwhose very existence hinges on the f re edom of opinion, should feel itself compelled to disown the Marxist group.\nIt may be argued that the Marxists\nadvocate a system of government that does\nnot allow personal liberty. To my mind\nthis is irrelevant. Extremist groups\nhave no chance of thriving except in a society that is fundamentally rotten.\nThe spread.of intolerance and ultra conformity can only help such a situation to come about.\nYours sincerely,\nI.N. Guy\nDear Sir,I should like to point out that the\nremarks concerning the proposed Marxist\nForum, in the anonymous commentary in the last issue of \" Felix\" were totally incorrect. Far from attempting to\nform the Society illegally the writer surely knows tn at we have over fulfilled the constitutional requirements\njust as we did four years ago when we\nwere refused permission to become a full society.\nThe writer reveals the reason for these smears when appealing for our\nSooiety not to be recognised in any form.\nPossibly the embarrassment he or she\nwrites of, is due to his or her own\nem baras s ment at any group of people\nbeing prepared to speak their minds\nopenly.\nYours faithfully, Judy Cox.\n(for proposed Marxist Forum}\nDear Sir, In the last issue of \" Felix\", vo u make w batI can only describe a petty\nattack upon the Marxist Sub-group, under\nthe plea that it is an \"embarrassment\"\nto the I.C. Union. How this comes about\nwe are not * oid, the reason obviously\nbeing that your accusations are false. Since in the 3a me issue we are\nregaled with an article upon the lack\nof political freedom in South Africa, one cannot but wonder at the philosophy\nof one who would deny the 3a me freedom\nat home, wit .in his own College.\nPerhaps he really prefers the policies of Iir. Irving, and may violate the freedom of the press by not printing this letter..\nYours disgustedly,\nP.J. Roberts (Fred)\nPhys. III. "

Strange hats,and even\nstranger shirts were in evidence, but\nthe ideas of what the Chicago ga nster looked like were varied and mostly\nincorrect. One gentleman, who\napparently was still thinking of the\nlast Gad-Ids Carnival turned ap dressed\nas a pirate. when questioned about\nthis all he said was \"Poetic Licence\".\nWhether the accent should be on the\nBeetle or the Licence, who knows?\nYoung ladies, mostly of pleasing pro-portions, appeared in this, that and\nthe other, (mostly the other) adding\ndecoration of the most pleasing kind.\nThe flats and decor were excellent,\nreally excellent. \"Rush\" designed the\nflats and deserves congratulations for\nthem. \"Lefty\" Hawkins was in charge\nof the construction and the chief\norganiser, was Eddie \"Pelvis\" Fersht.\nThe nickname is of recent origin, due\nto the fact that he fell off a ladder and\nbruised his hip while taking down the\nflats. There are two versions to this\nmishap. Eddie's version is that\nsomeone moved the ladder, everyone else's is that he fell asleep and then fell off. May we offer our condolences?\nThe Cabaret, written by Eddie and\nPete Morgan with music by Stan Salmons\nwas produced by Pete Morgan.

In\nfact the whole o a bare t was well done.\nThe Security system was devised\nby \"Big Ben\" Bindley 'that- well rounded\no he s a personality who has the misfortune to live above Frank Irving.\nUnfortunately, while acting the part of\nthe body to perfection in \"Hunt the\nBody\", he lost his watch in a sea of\ntomato ketchup. He later got his watch\nback, but the tomato ketchup proved\nirrecoverable.\nThe bar was well manned and well\npatronised even to the extent of Arthur\nand Howard who popped in far a. quick\none after the Union Bar was o lose d. BOYCOTT\nRGS.\nCARNIVAL\n(J) ALE BIRDS\nIki Mr. Mooney was also in attendance,\nsupervising the food in the Lower and\nUpper Dining Halls.\nPeople were still dancing at\n5 o 'clock, and apparently had enough\nenergy left to enjoy themselves. Of\no our se,a number had disappeared to hold\ntheir own private carnivals in Hostel\nRooms. Altogether an enjoyable Carnival,\nfree from riots and ribaldry. The\norganisers deserve thanks for all the\nwork they did in making the Carnival the\nundoubted success that it was.\nSTOP PRESS\nPAGE 9\nThe I.C. Union General Meeting has\nnow decided that students from this\nCollege shall boycott all goods from\nthe Union of South Africa. For the\nbenefit of those who have not thought\nseriously about this, it will be useful to mention some of the articles now\ntaboo.\nIt is, of course, obvious that tinned fruits are out. No more peaches,\npears, apricots or passion fruit. No\nmore Outspan oranges. We must tell\nMooney about this. No South African\nsherry before Hall Dinner, so we'11\nhave to pay twice the price for the real\nthing. We must not wat oh the Springboks when they're next over her (Rugger\nand Crioket Clubs, please note). But\nla eki es, what have our politicians done!\nGold and diamonds come from South Africa.\nNo more engagement rings'. Woe is I. C.W. A. But let us boycott further. We\nare all aware that a Colour Bar exists\nin the U.S.A. As a logical step, we\nmust boycott all things American. No\ncigarettes, few records^ hardly any\nfilms, no Jayne, and no Jazz. Jazz\nClub, disband'. The politicians have\nsaid as much.\nThe French of course, are wicked\noppressors in Algeria. No brandy, wine,\nno Bar-dot. Still, we o an always buy\nKeg.\nOr o an we? Some bright politician\nmust surely say that the British are the\nworst of the lot. Kenya, Nyasaland,\nCyprus, Singapore, Malta, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Nether Hopping. Boycott all things British! No food, no\nclothes, no nothing'. A merry life\nmaybe, but rather a short one.\nPoliticians, grow up! What do you\nthink we are. Your puerile motion was\npassed only because thinking people\nstayed away from the meeting. We are\nall opposed to Apartheid in practice,\nbut there are more intelligent ways of\nvoicing disapproval than passing\nboycott motions.\nIt has always been an unwritten\nrule at I.C. that politics, in any form,\nshall not be a subject of official\nUnion business. The President has the\npower to refuse any motion from the\nfloor, and an impartial President\nwould have refused this one. The\napproval of this motion must have caused\nconsiderable em barras ment to South\nAfrican students here, a fact which\nour politicians obviously ignored.\nFor heavens sake, lets keep polit-ies, left, right, or upside down, out\nof Union affairs. We've got enough\npolitical and racial societies at the\nCollege already to air our views in\ndiscussion, without childish hotheads\nopening their mouths at Union meetings.\nIf we can't have intelligent debate at\na Union meeting, lets finish it at\ntwenty-past one.\nM.S.

    "content": "CALUS TORRBE\nOur (learned) editor in his cor.ment\nof the last issue mentioned the\nappalling lack of culture in the\ngeneral I.C. students. As nontechnical reading is considered to aid\na full education, this book column has\nbeen formed.\n' Lolita, light of my life, fire of\nmy loins. My s in, my soul.\nLo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking\na trip of three steps down the palate\nto tap at three on the teeth.\nLo. Lee. la.' So begins the most di sousse d and\ncertainly most interesting book of the\nyear. LOLITA by VLADIMIR NABOKOV,\nprice 21/-.\nIt is the story of Humbert Humbert,\na man oba esse d with an unusually strong\ndesire for' nymph ets1. His definition of this term takes up five pages\n(ardent indeed) but can be given\nroughly as a girl child between the\nages of nine and fourteen of feline cheekbone and downy limb.\nThe book, written biographical ly( though entirely fictitious), starts\nwith H.H.'s early life before he finds Lolita; a life of frustration and\ndissatisfaction with his wife, whom he\nlater divorces. His emotions and\nthoughts are introduced, remaining the\ndominant feature throughout, giving a picture of a taut nervous character\nAfter separation he wanders aimlessly\ntill his chance meeting with Lolita. She is the daughter of a widow, who\nrents a room to eager Humbert. Pate\ntakes a hand as mother Haze fails in love with her lodger and, of course, he\naccepts marriage, giving him the\nopportunity to father rosebud Lolita. Mrs. Haze shortly after the wedding\nis a eo ident ly run down and killed by\na oar leaving Humbert solely responsible\nfor Lo. What oo ul d be better than to\ntake her for a restful tour of the country?\nNeedless to say she becomes his mistress\nin a very short time. Humbert then\ndevelops a into a man with a fanatical jealousy and anxiety neurosis,\nexperiencing a frustration which he\nfinds o an not be satisfied. Finally, when he loses Lo, he reaches the edge\nof insanity, commits murder and is arrested.\nThe author, Vladimir Nabokov, was\nborn in Russia of aristocratic parents\nat a time of general unrest. He became\na refugee at the outbreak of the\nrevolution and lived in France, then\nGermany, for some years. In 1940 he\nemigrated to America where he remains.\nAnyone reading this novel for its pornographic worth ( if that is not contra-dic tory) would be completely disappointed.\nPornography must take the reader from one\nsexual scene to another with the bridging,\nproviding the necessary sequence to the\nstory, as small as possible otherwise\nhe will lose patience. Only the sexual\u2022\npassions should be aroused. Tuis is obviously not the case with Lolita. The sensual scenes play only a minor\npart, in o lude d to illustrate Humbert's state of mind. It was not the obscene\nnature of the book that horrified the\npublishers but the theme of a middle-aged man having a twelve year old mistress.\nAs is stated in the Foreword \"offensive\"\nis often just a synonym for \"unusual\".\nCertainly it is the latter.\" FELIX\nBut whatever is said, Lolita is a boo i cw hi oh should not be ignored. It's style is lively, delightful and outspoken.\nThe infinite moods and situations of\nHumbert are produced vividly, reminiscent\nof Proust, giving the reader a complete\npicture of this complex character.\nThe place names are also a pleasure to\nread: Insomnia Lodge, Grimm Road, and\nmany other such Joycean word plays.\nThe analogies of his work with\nKafka, Proust and Joyce, however, do not\nretract from Nabokov's original style and brilliance in writing and the\nobvious merit of hi a work.\nHe has spoken English and Russian all his life due to his English governess\nand has studied for a degree at\nCambridge. His command of both\nlanguages is illustrated by his many\nbooks. He has written eight novels in Russian and three in English. He has\nalso published English and French\ntranslations of Russian poets and\noriginal poetry in English. His move\nto America has caused him to evolve a vivid English style of international acclaim. He teaches and is an ardent\nbutterfly collector in his spare time.\nThis latest book of his has caused\na flurry of comments. In fact so many\nvarying criticisms have been written\non this book that one is left in utter confusion after reading them. One\ndescribes the book as 'Young America\ndebauching old Europe' and yet\nanother as 'Old Europe debauching\nyoung America'. Critics have been\nfinding all manner of hidden meanings\nfrom the undertones in Humbert's brain\nbut author Nabokov says that its just\nanother story with no moral intended.\nHe wrote it because the story occurred\nto him and he liked it. The inspiration came while he was\nliving in lar is and he wrote it as a short story in Russian, the places and\npeople contained being French. Not\nliking the finished article he\ndestroyed it and so it remained for ten\nyears till its rebirth in the present\nform.\nPublishers presented with it were\nappalled and considered it obscene and\nwould not print. Thus started the\nwell known controversy which raged till at last we can see for ourselves.\nAs a complete contrast, the\nsecond book discussed is BORSTAL' BOY\nby 3REND AIV BEKAN, price 16/-.\nThis is an autobiography of\ncertainly the most vivacious playwright\nof our time. In this book he deals with\nhis life from the time of his arrest in Liverpool for I.R.A. activities to his eventual release and his gradual\ntendency away from the I.R.A. and\nCatholicism to his present humanitarian\nideals which are illustrated in his two plays.\nHe introduces the reader to the\nvaried assortment of characters who\nmake up the grey world of prison and\nthe slightly brighter one of a or stal Institution in a masterly story. The\nscrews, wide boys, ponce s, toughs, the\nCocxneys, Geordies and Taffies, which\nhave since dominated his writing, are\nall portrayed in his own un mistake able way. This book is worth reading, if only for the insight on prison and\nBorstal life; if only for the ohara c ter studies of the inmates; if only for the comedy and humour contained. It should certainly not be missed as all three are in one memorable volume.\nMARXIST SUB-GROUP MEETING\nThe meeting of the Marxist SubGroup on Thursday, Lec. 3rd, was\nheralded by a loudspeaker announcement\nurging us \"to hear a pro-Marxist speaker,\nthe inference being that thi a would\nbe a change, presumably a kick against\nattempts to eradicate this \"embarrass-ment to the I.C. Union\", ( Felix, Nov.\n27th.).W students did turn up to\nhear Dr. Lewis speak on \"Marxism and\nScience\".\nDr. Lewis' contention was that the\ncapitalist system is incapable of\nsolving the world's most pressing\nproblem, that of raising the living standards of the 1,700,000,000 human\nbeings at present living below the poverty line. He suggested that Britain has not the capital resources to\ndevelop her own territories and\nthat the whole capitalist system is hampered by its lack of coordination,\nand its desire to see potential gain\nbefore investing capital. Quoting\nsurveys and reports on the Soviet\neconomy made by Western observers,Dr.\nLewis pointed out that the U.3.S. R. turns out three times as many trained\ntechnologists per year as the U.S.A., and that it has twice as many scientists working on fundamental research. He\noutlined the Soviet system of scientific research programmes directed by a central commission with Five-year\nplanning, and quoted, again from a Western report, that in some instances\n(e.g. in machine tools) Soviet industry\nis much more efficient than the\ncapitalist industry. The question\nwas, would capitalism show itself able\nto cope with the world's population\nproblems, or would the socialist block,\nwith its undoubted economic and scientific resources, step in first? \u2022\nDr. Lewis confined himself to the\nmaterial aspects of modern Marxism and\nin the discussion only two questions\ntouched on human rights and the position of minorities under Marxism. There is no doubt that the U.S.S.R. can now\nproduce more trained technologists than\nthe Western world, but can it produce\nindividuals capable of> and allowed,\noriginal thought and action? Does\nMarxism reduce the individual to a mere\ncog, with little control over his own\nfuture, as the Readers Digest tries to\ntell us?\nWhatever the answers to these\nquestions, it is certain that unless\nthe capitalist world concerns itself more with the under-developed countries,\nthe socialist block will convert more\nand more of these countries to communism,\nto the detriment of our position.\nIn his concluding remarks, Lr. Lewis\ntold the meeting in strong terms that\nfar too many over fed people ape content\nto ignore the fact that two-thirds of\nthe world's population is always hungry,\nand that if we do not face this pro b lem, then, in one form or another, it will overwhelm us.\nMUSIC with a BEAT\nIf you prefer swing to tangos,\nif you'd rather hear Lyttleton, Brown\nand Barber, than the Joe Blogg? s Sextet, if you think Cole, Sinatra Fitzgerald,Mathis, Peggy and Sarah\nare the tops, and if you like jiving to Bobby Darin, Lonnie Donnegan, Cliff Richards, the undulating Elvis and the\nbeat of Billy May, Ted Heath, Basic\nor Mulliean, make a date for the series of record hops at I.C. The first one was on Wednesday,\n2nd. December in the top refectory at\nthe Union and from the noise a good\nevening appeared to be had by all. A final word to the Victor Sylvester enthusiasts: ou won't dig this. "

    "content": "FELIX\nNOW IT CAN BE TOLD\nYou may remember that some\ntime ago \"Bo\" was removed by some\nSouthampton students. Now it is possible to give the full story, as seen\nthrough the eyes of the Press. A large\nnumber of newspapers, varying from the\nTimes to the Korthern Echo, Darlington\nand the \"Gioranle D' Italia della Dominica\"\nof Roma featured the story. Let us\nfi rot investigate hew the raiders\nremoved the car. First the Times.\n\"Four students made off with the car\nafter spending two hours moving a dynamo .\nweighing a ton and a half.\" The Halifax Courier and Guardian - \"Two doors were\nbroken down in getting it away\". The\nNorthern Eoho Darlington went into detail\"^ Gordon Moore,aged 25 and Mike\nThorne, aged 22 got into a coal cellar and let in Terry Marsh, 18, and his2 G year old girlfriend Mary Sexton. They\nwere in the building nearly six hours.....\nOnce again Sex rears its ugly head.\nThe Italian paper mentioned, was very\nbrief and to the point \"Poiche un\ngenerator e dio or rented el peso di1500 chilo gram nd impe diva ilp as sag gi odell a anti o a \"James and Browne\" gli student i hann or azzi a to, in una a dia cent e palestra,\ntutti ip at tinia rot el leo he han no trovato e,s mon tate nele ru Ote, han no disse minato sul pavi men to icus c in etti as fer e sui qu ali hann of at tors corre re ilp e sante a gg egg i o.\"\"H pes an tea gg egg io\" indeed. It is high time that\nthese foreign newspapers got their fact a right. Next to the statements made by\n\"spokesmen\" \"President of I.C.\" and\nseveral other worthies. Yorkshire Post\"(the students) have been told they will be prosecuted unless the car is returned.*\nThe Exeter Express and Echo - \"\"The Car\nbelongs tb the City and guilds Motor Club\nand is a very valuable model\" said a, spoke man\". Various other words were supposed to\nhave been said by people usually denoted by\n\"spokesman\". Looking through \"these\ncuttings one notices that Bo is thought\nto be the mascot of \"London Engineering\nStudents\", according to such widely\nspaced papers as the Belfast News letter, The Dorset Daily Echo and the Birmingham\nPost. But all these have a smattering\nof truth. The Evening News indulged\nin a real flight of fano y and stated,\nquite cate gc rio ally, that Bo is\" a1902 De Dion Bouton\". For some reason, best\nknown to themselves, the Evening Standard\nsaid \"a1902 French Boanerges Car has\ndisappeared from Imperial College .\"\nThe last word should be had by\nour Italian friends. In all justice they say \" II can cello della ville tt a a bit at adal parr o co, protestant e,del villa gg io era stato fest on a to da pi u di una dozzi nad is otto vest i ed al tri in dume nti multi color i\". AROUND\nTHE\nTOWN\nSeveral weeks ago when commenting\nupon the Old Vic's production of \"As You\nLike It\", I said that it was quite refreshing to see them trying to break away\nfrom purely conventional interpretations\nthat have so long been handed down from\ngeneration to generation of amateur groups;.\nThe present production of Richard II is now\nI feel another step backwards. The scenes\nand lighting effects are as usual excellent\nbut the acting lacks that creative imagination which a good producer should be able\nto enthuse into his players. Richard,\na king who is morally weak yet proudly\narrogant, believing in his divine right,\nis brought to his tragic death by the\ngrowing forces of those who believe in\nthe right to a freely chosen monarchy.\nThe actions and thoughts are therefore the\nnatural-result of his attitude and the\nattitude of his forebears, that he was\nchosen of God. He is not a play-boy\nnor is he effeminate, but many times\nhe has been presented as each and John\n.Justin does not step out of line.\nGeorge Baker as Bollngbroke, also lacks\nthe power and conviction of a man who is\nstrong and surely rather sinister when\ncompared with Richards weakness and\nin no ce no e. The play is above all a poet io masterpiece and should not be\nmissed,if only for this reason.\nI regret to Say that musicals,\nunless they are good and I mean really\ngood, bore me more than any other type\nof entertainment, (including the London\nZoo). Eric Spear and Charles Macarthur\nHardy who have written Kookaburra which is\nnow running at the Princes Theatre, lack\nthat stroke of genius that can turn a rather weak play with songs into a great\nshow. The play without songs was Joyce\nDenny's, Rain Before Seven, which is a study of an Australian household in the\n\"outback\" into which a young ra rmer implants his recently acquired English wife,\nnatural complications arise. Tne songs or\nEric Spear occasionally in t erupt the course\nor the plot but do little more beyond tn is. ine comedy is Australian. Let me say\nno more.'\nA Lesbian, A woman who has murdered\nler illegitimate child and a coward who\nbetrayed hie friends in a South American\nrevolution, are locked together in a. room for eternity. This is the dramatic\nsituation created in Jean Paul Sartre's play \"Huis Cloe\" and now after years of\ncensorship }ust released as a film under\nthe English title of \"Vicious Circle\".\nTnis is Sartre's idea of hell. iris, the Lesbian, tries to ^ in d consolation\nfor her situation in Estille. Estille\ntries to gain support from the masculine\nleader-ship of liar cia w no in turn feeling\nhi a weakness tries to rind understanding\nthrough Iria. The vicious circle is\ncomplete. Tnia is an experience which\nmay shock you or thrill you, but at\"\nleast I think that you must feel a strange sympathy with the idea.\nA new and well publicised recent\nrelease is \"The Hor8e Soldiers\". It\nia a \"retake\" of the well tried equation\nof American Cavalry, Civil War, innocent\nyoung a oldie rs who did not want to fight\nin any case, and one young attractive\nfemale, preferably with red or blond hair.\nJohn Wayne leads the merry band, who are\npoise a to win the war by attacking a vital\nsupply route. The rest of the film could\nbe called, \"Incidents On the Journey\".\nThis production would have been a masterpiece in1929. Ricci.\nSTUDENT EXCHANGE\nAs in previous years, arrangements have been made with certain technological institutions for exchange\nscholarships. This year the following\nawards are open.\nTeohnishe Universltat. Berlin\nChariot ten burg: to all students for\none year or leas, with a monthly\nallowance of 300 DM.\nAachen Teohnische Hoohaohule:for P.G.' s in Mining,Metallurgy,\nMeeh and Civil Eng. for a9 month\nperiod with award of 300 DM a month\n(approx. \u00a3235)\nEidginoasiche Teohnische Hoohsohule.\nZurich:- for P.G.' s only. An award of\n4000 Swiss fran os( \u00a3235) and a stay of\none session.\nA sound knowledge of German is required for all posts. For further\ninformation, apply to the Registrar.\nSir Arthur Acland English Essay Prize\nI have been asked by the Registrar\nto remind all students of this prize, the\npurpose of wh i oh is to promote and\neno our age the writing of good English.\nAll entries for the competition must\nbe submitted by the 15th Jan,1960 and\nprize money, to the total of 25 guineas\nwill be awarded to the winners.\nThe subject for the essay may be\nany general topic,but not purely so i ent if le or technological.\nFurther information and the rules\nof the competition will be supplied by\nthe Registrar.\nART CLUB\nThere are many gap3 in our College\nlife gap3 wh i oh people are always\ntrying to fill, though sometimes crea ti ing; one such gap will be filled( we\nhope in December) by an exhibition of\npaintings, drawings, sculpts etc:\ncontributed by members of I.C., both\nstudents and staff. The exhibition will not be large but we hope, of reasonable quality. Anyway, that you may\njudge for yourselves.\njudge for yourselves - in comfort - for it is to be held in the upper lounge.\nWe feel that it is preferable to have a little crowding in the hangings, with\ncomfort for the patrons, rather than\nwidely spaced pictures viewed to the\nmusic of un ry th m ical tip it it at s of heels\non marble floors. Oh, by the way the finals e leo tion has not yet been made, 30 if there is a anyone (student or staff) not yet known\nto the Art Club Chairman, who would like to exhibit, will he please contact M. Gerlooh soon.\nA point worthy of mention, we think,\nis this: there will be a number of\nmodernistic or even abstract paintings-although many people are fairly well\naqua in ted with these styles of art, there are still many who misunderstand\nand even despise them out of hand. We\nplead, therefore, to get to know and\nunderstand, to be excited by, any form\nof visual or other art, you must set\nout to like them. Your liking, at\nfirst, may have no better foundation\nthan snobbery, but it will soon\ncrystal lise to either dislike for good\nreasons or an admiration with sincerity. And then, of course, you are an Art lover with much sought after opinions!!\n\n"

IN NIGERIA\nThat a university and the so oie ty within which it develops are interdependent is widely recognised today.\nIn the younger countries this relationship is particularly important for\noften the university is not aware of\nits own needs or its ser vio es to\nso oie ty. One can say that the\nfostering of the university community\nitself to enable it to serve itself and society is a cardinal aim of\nW.U. S.. In Nigeria, this ser vio e began\nsix years ago when a committee including students and staff members was\nformed at the University College,\nIbadan - Nigeria's sole university\ninstitution. No doubt many of the\nmembers of this committee knew next to\nnothing about W.U. S. and only joined\nin out of a spirit of adventure and\nfear of not being left out of a \"new\nthing\". That the original composition was not the best it could be was\nsoon evident from the attitude of the\ncollege to W.U. S. Many people felt\nit was an exclusive group camouflaging\nunder a sweet name.\nThe committee's character has\ntherefore changed in the past years\nwith a view to representing as many\ninterests as possible.\nNowadays the oo a mitte e consists\nof student representatives nominated\nby such bodies as the Students'\nUnion, the U.N.S. A., the S. C.M., the\nFax Romana and others. In addition\nto these students, ether s are appointed\nas members-at large,usually because\nor ne ip they are able to render to\nthe committee. Then there are staff\nmembers who are however in a numerical\nminority. Although a staff member is appointed chairman, students are\nappointed as vice-chairman and secret-ary.\nAn exchange scheme has been\narranged whereby a postgraduate student crosses from Nigeria to the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and vice versa, under the auspices\nof W.U. S. The value of the personal\ncontact involved in this scheme o an hardly be over emphasised. The W.U. S. in Nigeria has been\nthe reo i pie nt of gifts from outside.\nA mimeographing machine and a typewriter donated by W.U. S. international\nbody have helped the several student\norganisations within the college to\nmeet their publishing commitments.\nMore and more W.U. S. at Ibadan\naims to educate the university about\nthe need for a world university\nservice and its advantages.\nMOTORING NEWS\nThe season so far has been a very\nsuccessful one for the o lub. In\nparticular support for meetings has\nbeen very good and competitive events\nwell supported numerically.\nThe year started with a record number\nof members Joining at the fresher s' reception, including several from R.C.S. and R.S. M. who were invited to join for\nthe first time. Several good recent\nfilms on motoring have been shown,\nincluding a rare film on the Cummins\nDiesel Race Car at Indianapolis, U.S.A. and Coupe des Alpes, 1958, reckoned to\nbe one of the best films on motor sport\never made. A quiz on motoring was well\nreo eiv ed and enthusiastically answered,\nand a talk by a member on \"Special\nBuilding\" started off a ome lively con trove ray on the subject.\nReoently about a dozen members tried'\ntheir hand at Driving Teats with good\nresults, finishing 1, 2, 3, on handicap,\na considerable achievement against the\nNorth London Enthusiasts C.C. and the\nrest of University.\nBo has given a more than usual\namount of trouble after the extensive\nprofessional overhaul in summer. He\nreached Brighton with 55 minutes to spare\nhaving been propelled more by manpower\nthan engine power.\nThe plan a for the rest of the\na ea a on are well advanced and include a visit to the M.S. Car Company and to\nLord Montagu' a car museum at Beaulieu.\nThe main competitive event is the\ninter-college rally organised by a e om mitte e of U.H. U.L.M. C. members from\nall the colleges of the University.\nAgain a good entry from Guilds will\nmake success easier for the club.\nCONSERVATIVE S0U1BTIn addressing the Society recently\non the European Free Trade Association,\nMr. Maurice Macmillan, M.P. for Halifax\ngave a most interesting and informative\ntalk. However, comparatively few people\nattended to hear his lecture. The\nSociety therefore encourages you to come\nand make future meetings as thought\nprovoking as Politios should be.\nJ.G. S. "
