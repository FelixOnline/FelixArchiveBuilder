Among his many\nroles, he has served as the Principal of\nthe Faculty of Natural Sciences, President of the Optical Society of America,\nChair of the Science Board of the Science and Technology Facilities Council and Editor of the Journal of Modern\nOptics for 19 years.\nIn the last 30 years at Imperial, Sir\nPeter has helped establish the UK as\na world leader in quantum optics and\nplayed a major part in Imperial\u2019s rise\non the world stage. In the coming years\nhe will continue to shape Imperial in a\nnew role of Senior Principal.\nThe following are edited extracts from\na lengthy interview.\nSir Peter, congratulations on your\nnew Senior Principal role. Do you\nhave any particular aims for this\nrole?\nOne of the things I look at is how do\nyou encourage multidisciplinary work\nto flourish, while still protecting de-partments. Imperial College has a fantastic reputation for doing fundamental science but also then applying it to\ndifferent disciplines. The other part of\nmy job will be on our research strat-egy. What should Imperial focus on\nand how can we do it well? The college\nstrategic research committee will be a\nfocal point to build a consensus about\nour research priorities.\nFrom your position on the Science\nand Technology Facilities Council and in the current economic\nclimate, how do you see science\nfunding changing in the near\nterm?\nDuring any economic downturn, investing in the future through training\nand education is a very sensible thing\nto do, in order to bounce out of the recession equipped for the next period of\ngrowth. In reality there will likely be a\nretrenchment of everything that is less\nimmediate for politicians in terms of\nvoter concern. They have to protect\nthe health service and the schools, so\nwhat will actually suffer are the things\nthey think they can put off and that\nincludes both the science base and the\ninnovation base, although recent signs\nare that Government recognizes the\nneed for investment in science and engineering to position ourselves well in\ncoming out of the recession.\nOver the last decade we have seen the\ndoubling in the science budget and incidentally being a department head or\nfaculty principal during that time has\nactually been quite straightforward.\nThe next five years might be quite difficult and the next department head is\ngoing to have to be pretty inventive.\nIncidentally we do have a buffer in\nour order book, Natural Sciences has\nabout 90% of next year\u2019s order book secured in terms of grants and 75% the\nyear after. It\u2019s great to have this buffer,\nbut I think we need to be agile in securing the future: I think we have a great\nvision and much to offer the world!\nDo you think scientists are unrealistic about hopes for funding?\nWe have a whole raft of post docs\nand students who have only known\ngood times. The geriatrics in the department like me can remember what\nhappened at the end of the 1970s in\nthe university sector and that was not\na pleasant experience. You could only\nmake telephone calls in the afternoon,\nas it was cheaper, and you could not\nphotocopy. It was absurd.\nCould higher tuition fees fill the\npotential funding gap?\nWhen you are coming into what\nlooks like a fairly painful recession, it\nmay not be very sensible to charge parents more. Only consider that avenue\nif you have done a very careful analysis\nabout the added value of a degree and\nwhether parents think this is a good\nidea in terms of investment. I suspect\nparents are also seriously retrenching\nover the coming year or too. So student fee hikes could be a bad idea even\nthough we do get a lot from them.\nIn the longer term, Alumni are a very\nserious prospect for university fund-ing. If we retain our proper links with\nformer students and we tell them what\nwe are doing, there is every prospect\nthey will want to support us.\nWhat is your response to the 70%\nrise in international students in\nthe last five years? Is that a trend\nthat you think will continue?\nI don\u2019t think it will continue much\nmore than it has done. If you look at\nthe proportion of home students to\ninternational students at Imperial College, we have the highest percentage\nin the country. It demonstrations we\nare truly a world class institution, and\nclearly a very attractive place to study.\nWe will always want the best students\nfrom around the world irrespective of\norigin, but on the other hand, I think\npeople would want to come for an education that is Imperial, that is British\nand so on. Therefore I cannot see the\npercentages increasing dramatically\nmore than currently.\nFrom a scientific point of view,\nMcCain or Obama?\nAlthough Obama has been quite\nelusive about his policies, he seems to\nbelieve in evidence based science and\npolicies and I feel quite comfortable\nwith that. I am not overly comfortable\nwith the McCain and Palin approach\nwhich is clearly more faith driven\nand less driven by science. I struggle\nwith McCain\u2019s use of language such\nas foetal farming. This is emotive and\nincorrect language, and these issues\nwould be better dealt with calmly and\nrationality.\nImagine you had just completed\nan Imperial College science degree and you were deciding on a\nPhD thesis now, what areas would\nyou consider?\nThat is a great question. I have enormously enjoyed being part of the revolution in quantum optics and informa-tion.IfIwerestartingnow,thepartIam\nreally fascinated with is the interaction\nbetween the Physicist and the Biologist\nlooking at not just structural biology,\nA\nnew report published\nyesterday shows the dramatic scale of the current\necological crisis. The Living Planet Report, published jointly by the World Wide Fund\nfor Nature (WWF), the Zoological\nSociety of London (ZSL), and Global\nFootprint Network (GFN), highlights\nthe global shift towards unsustainable\nusage of the planet\u2019s resources.\nAccording to the report, which looks\nat global ecological \u2018footprints\u2019 \u2013 the\namount of land used for providing resources and storing waste \u2013 as well as\nbiodiversity loss and environmental\ndamage, three quarters of the world\u2019s\npopulation is now living beyond its\necological means, in countries that\nconsume faster than resources can be\nrenewed.\nThe worst offenders are the US and\nChina, with a combined global footprint of 42%. The countries with the\nsmallest footprints, such as Malawi\nand Afghanistan, use as little as 0.5\nhectares per person, revealing a stark\ndichotomy between the west, including heavily industrialised nations such\nas China and UAE, and the developing\nworld.\nThe UK was 15th on the list, with an\naverage footprint of 5.3 hectares per\nperson, more than double the \u2018permitted\u2019 land area of 2.1 hectares. The\nUK government yesterday announced\nits support for a new \u2018carbon audit\u2019\ninitiative, which allows businesses and\nthe public sector to assess the carbon\nemissions of their goods and services.\nRecent research by the Carbon Trust\nfound that just 1% of companies know\ntheir own carbon footprint.\nThe Living Planet Report says that\nwe are over-using the planet\u2019s resources by 30%. According to James Leape,\ndirector-general of WWF International, if the current trend continues\nunchecked then by the mid-2030s \u201cwe\nwould need...two planets to maintain\nsuch a lifestyle.\u201d He called it \u201ca more\nfundamental crisis\u201d than the credit\ncrunch. This estimate, the Report says,\nis conservative, as it doesn\u2019t account\nfor the possibility of \u2018feedback loops\u2019\nsuch as runaway climate change, predicted in many models.\nThe Report comes in the wake of\nseveral other reports highlighting, var-iously, the biodiversity and economic\nlosses of the crisis.\nThis month\u2019s IUCN Red List of\nThreatened Species revealed almost\none in four mammals to be at risk\nof extinction, while an EU-commissioned report \u2013 The Economics of\nEcosystems and Biodiversity (Teeb) \u2013\ncompared the money lost during the\npresent banking crisis to the value of\ndeforestation. They found that annually the loss of the world\u2019s rainforests\ncosts $2-5 trillion (7% of global GDP)\nwhile the estimated market losses so\nfar during the credit crunch amount to\n$2.8 trillion.\nTeeb, due to be completed in 2010,\nis similar in scope to the Stern review\ninto the economics of climate change,\nwhich did much to thrust that issue\ninto the public sphere. Although there\nare concerns about the ethics of \u2018economising\u2019 conservation, many believe\nthat highlighting the \u2018intrinsic\u2019 value of\nbiodiversity has so far failed, and there\nis a need to approach environmental\nproblems from a different angle.\nAlso in the Report was the Living\nPlanet Index, authored by ZSL, which\nassess the \u2018health\u2019 of global biodiversity.\nIt found an average decline since 1970\nof nearly 30% in populations of 1,686\nvertebrate species, with the most serious impacts felt in the Tropics where\npopulation losses were more than 50%.\nThis is mostly due to deforestation and\nchanging land use, while marine populations were impacted more by overfishing and pollution.\nTo remedy the crisis, WWF has proposed so-called \u2018sustainability wedges\u2019.\nThese involve breaking down the contributing factors and tackling them\nseparately with tailored solutions. The\nmain forks of the wedge solution are\nreducing consumption (by travelling\nless or using sex education to lower\npopulation growth) and making production sustainable (by switching to\nrenewable energy sources and using\nnew technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS)).\nThe Report ends on an optimistic\nnote \u2013 \u2018The good news is ... it is not\ntoo late to prevent an irreversible ecological recession setting in\u2019 \u2013 but this is\ntempered with the reality of individual\nwill versus political action. Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the WWF\u2019s international\npresident, said: \u2018Where is the collective\naction, the bold leadership, and the vision required to conserve the biodiversity of the planet? ... I see very little of\nsuch passion.\u2019\nusing imaging and diffraction and so\non, but dynamical information. So if I\nwas starting over again and I had a bit\nmore experimental ability than I really\ndo have, I would go in that direction.\nIt has an enormous number of fundamental and unanswered questions.\nIn your view how has Imperial\nchanged, since you were recruited\nby Geoff New in 1979?\nI have seen a purely science and engineering campus in South Kensington\nand Silwood, turn into largest built estate of any university in the UK, with\nhalf a million square meters. While it\nis not all plate glass, it certainly looks a\ngreat deal better than it did in the late\n80s. People have also become much\nmore ambitious about what they want\nto accomplish at Imperial College.\nThere is a feeling of confidence that\nImperial can tackle the toughest challenges facing mankind, from climate\nchange, to medical research, to playing\na leading role at CERN.\nDespite all your travels and extensive US collaborations, you have\nstayed at Imperial for 30 years\nhave you ever been tempted to\nmove?\nWell I think I got lost in the splen-dours and comfort of the Huxley building *laughs*.\nI stayed at Imperial because here I\ncould build a research activity in an\nemerging area. We did good work, and\npeople recognised our work was good,\nso the group expanded, allowing me to\nwork with people with tremendous insights and enthusiasm. The students at\nImperial College made it a joy. One of\nmy first students is now a FRS, so I am\nfeeling really ancient.\nI feel Imperial college has a degree of\nbuzz and focus not found elsewhere.\nThis is not just on the fundamental sci-ence, but also having done the science,\nensuring it makes a difference.\nAs Principal of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, you were instrumental in founding the Grantham Institute for Climate Change. How\ndo you see the centre developing\nin the years to come and who will\ndrive the progress?\nClimate change is a part of the\nGrantham Institution remit, but we\nwill also look at the wider issues of mitigation technology, renewable energy\nresources, the effects on bio-diversity\nof climate change and the effects on\nhealth.\nWe are very lucky to have Sir Brian\nHoskins as our scientific director.\nBrian is one of the most distinguished\nmeteorologists and climate change\nscientists in the world. The other major driver will be Dr Simon Buckle. In\nSimon, we have somebody who had\nworked with the Bank of England on\nfinancial modelling and risk and the\nForeign Office on global challenges.\nHe was awarded a CMG for his work\nas deputy ambassador in Kabul, so I\nthought he should not have too many\nproblems with the academic staff at\nImperial. It should be dead easy compared with Kabul. <laughs>\nWhen charismatic presenters such\nas Jeremy Clarkson first deny\nclimate change, then belittle its\nconsequences what can scientists\ndo?\nWhat scientists must do is have the\naccessible evidence at their fingertips,\nwhich says this is what we can see in\nterms of carbon dioxide\u2019s contributions\nto temperatures and the likely conse-quences. An important part is a frank\nassessment of errors and uncertainties,\nwhich is one of the many strengths of\nthe IPCC.\nWe are here in the famous Lecture\nTheatre 1 in Blackett. Where you\nhave lectured many times, will we\never see you again in the lecture\nhall?\nI really miss teaching, and what I\nhave done in the past, is finagle myself in to give guest lectures. So I drop\nheavy hints that I would not mind giving a guest lecture, so I am sure you\nwill see me again.\nPeter, thank you for your time.\nMeet Sir Peter Knight, FRS\nBlending an iPhone - ouch\nThe latest in Daniel\u2019s series of unmissable science videos - send your suggestions to science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nhttp://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=qg1ckCkm8YI\nDramatic increase in ecological crisis\nFelix\u2019s version of the green credit crunch\nFelix Whitton\nScience Correspondent\n\u201cMore fundamental than the credit crunch\u201d\nfelix Science Editor, Daniel Burrows, interviews the new Senior Principal of Imperial\nBad Science\nTalking of\nmoron-baiting...\nreaders of\nBen Goldacre\u2019s Bad\nScience\ncolumn in\nthe Guardian will already be familiar with his style: sometimes cajoling, sometimes scathing,\nalways fervently on the side of reason\nover quackery when it comes to sci-ence. This two-parter on the placebo\neffect, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4\nin August, is now available as a podcast\nand is well worth a listen. Dr Ben explores the different arguments on both\nsides with a more balanced approach\nthan one would expect from reading\nhis polemical essays. Subjects as diverse as Native American shamans, the\n\u2018role of theatre\u2019 in medicine, and the\nuse of sugar pills to cure depression are\ncovered, with plenty of interviews to\nflesh out the substance. An interesting\nand thought-provoking podcast which\nrarely strays into moral judgement but\nsimply allows the listener come to his\nor her own conclusions.\nwww.badscience.net\nSlacker\nPromising intro music (samples and\nwhatnot) but unfortunately Slacker\njustifies its name by appearing to be\nbroadcast from someone\u2019s basement.\nI hear giggles.

Sir Richard becomes\nthe new Chairman of the Board of Directors with immediate effect.\nIt seems Sir Richard cannot get\nenough of Imperial College, where\nwhich he spent seven controversial\nyears (2001 \u20132008) as Rector. BioCeramic Theraputics (BCT) Ltd is one of\nover 60 Imperial College spinout firms;\nbeing based on developmental research\nfrom the Departments of Biomedical\nMaterials and Material Sciences at Imperial College.\nA King\u2019s College biochemistry grad-uate, Sir Richard\u2019s role at BCT will not\nbe his first in this vein. Prior to accepting the post of Imperial\u2019s Rector, he\nwas chairman of pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline plc. His role at\nBCT is seemingly a smaller task than\nGlaxoSmithKline, as BCT is seen more\nto be an up-and-coming pioneer rather\nthan a multi-national corporation.\nAs Sir Richard takes over as Chairman, the companies are focusing their\nefforts in two generations of products.\nThe first is strontium-containing glass\nthat inhibits pathogens and promotes\ntissue growth. This versatile material\nwould be used as bone filler, coatings\nand even as structural scaffolding in\northopedic procedures. Furthering on\nthis, the company is also developing a\nnanostructured mimicry of the extracellular matrix that will surpass the\ncapabilities of the bioactive ceramics\nwhich are currently used.\nDaniel Green, BCT\u2019s CEO, commented on the appointment: \u201cSir Richard\u2019s immense experience and expert\nguidance will be invaluable as we move\nto the next stage of our growth plan:\ntaking our lead development products\nto a stage where they benefit the public.\u201d Sir Richard\u2019s role will aid the taking\nof scientific knowledge and application\nto a business level, something that was\nvery evident in his time as Rector. He\nwas responsible for several controversies including the rebranding of the\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nPrime Minister\nvisits Imperial\nThe Prime Minister, Gordon Brown,\nwas visiting Imperial College on Monday to attend \u201cThe Changing of a\nNew Economic Age\u201d event hosted by\nthe Imperial College Business School\n(Tanaka). Brown delivered a speech to\nacademics, business leaders and members of the press on his government\u2019s\nplans to deal with the global credit\ncrunch and restructuring of the UK\neconomy. Attending his speech were\nthe likes of Iain Conn, Director of BP\nand Chair of Imperial College Business\nSchool Advisory Board and Ian Coleman, Global Head of Emerging Markets at PriceWaterhouseCoopers.\nDuring his speech he described his\nspecial connection with Imperial College, saying: \u201cI have seen the expansion of this College and how it leads\nthe world in so many different fields.\u201d\nBrown also addressed the importance\nof maintaining public spending in\nbringing the country out of the eco-Dina Ismail\nNews Correspondent\nnomic downturn. He said now was the\nwrong time to slash investment in areas like education, training and energy\nefficiency or tax cuts for hard-pressed\nfamilies. The PM defended his strategy of higher borrowing to support\nthe economy, calling it the \u201cresponsible\u201d thing to do. His remarks came on\na day where the London stockmarket\nplunged by more than 5% and the sterling weakened again. Brown\u2019s speech\nwas followed by a Q&A session with\nhis audience, chaired by Professor\nDavid Begg and attended by Imperial\u2019s\nRector Sir Roy Anderson.\nDuring his visit the Prime Minister\nalso found time to meet with ten MBA\nStudents from Imperial\u2019s business\nschool to discuss the global credit crisis and hear their views. One student\nremarked, \u201cI agreed with a lot of what\nMr Brown said and he is taking a very\nproactive approach to finding a solution to the economic problems.\u201d While\nanother simply felt, \u201cit was a privilege\nto meet him. He was very easy to talk\nto and he seemed really relaxed.\u201d\nWe used to talk about\nhippies with guitars\nImperial College Union\u2019s Career Fair\nsaw unwelcome song and dance from\nprotestors on Wednesday 29th\nOctober.\nA group of IC student protesters forming the group \u201ce.on f off\u201d gathered at\nSouth Kensington in the early hours\nof the morning. One member had\nbrought with him his guitar, for what\nwas presumably a planned activity.\nUpon the lunch hour the \u201chippie\u201d\nantagonist began to play some of his\nhit tunes against Shell, including the\nallegedly popular \u201cUse soul power, not\ncoal power.\u201d He was promptly removed\nby Imperial College security, not to be\nseen for the rest of the day.\nWhen asked why the reason for a\nprotest, one \u201ce-on f-off\u201d representative\nbegan to regurgitate lines such as \u201ce.on\nwant to build 6 coal factories, and are\ncurrently getting permission for the\nfirst one. If the first one is approved,\nthey have plans to build 17 others\nwithin Europe and Russia.\nRavi Pall\nNews Correspondent\nAlexander McKee, a representative\nfrom Imperial College Union, commented on the protestors breach of\nconduct, telling felix that \u201cthey were\ntold not to protest inside, not to cause\nany major scenes, to just distribute information outside the marquee.\u201d This\nwas not the case, with the protesters\noperating directly in front of the e.on\nstall. felix also has it\u2019s doubts if the guitar playing man was actually a student\nof Imperial College.\nThe topic of higher education has come\ninto the limelight again after David\nLammy, the new Minister of State for\nHigher Education, commented that\nthere might be too many universities\nin the United Kingdom.\nThe remarks were made in an address delivered at a Universities UK\n(UUK) event on the 14th October, entitled \u2018The Future Size and Shape of the\nHigher Education Sector\u2019.\nThe new minister pointed out several\nproblems facing the higher education\nsector, as well as possible solutions.\nIn his speech, Lammy asked: \u201cDo you\nhave the right number of institutions?\nIn the commercial sector there would\nhave to be many mergers over the\nnext few decades \u2013 far more than we\nhave seen in higher education. Could\nmore be done to encourage that among\nuniversities?\u201d\nThe idea of merging universities has\nexisted for some time now. Back in\nNovember 2002 the previous Rector,\nSir Richard Sykes, attempted to form\na merger between Imperial College\n[IC] and University College London\n[UCL]. However after four weeks of\ntalks, the proposal was called off. Sir\nRichard claimed that it had \u201cbecome\nclear that the best interests of our two\ninstitutions are not served by a formal\nmerger.\u201d One senior academic from\nUCL told felix about IC\u2019s political in-tention, describing the proposals as\na takeover rather than a true merger.\nThe academic referred to the situation\nas \u201cmore of a rape than a marriage.\u201d\nUltimately, the merger crumbled\nsince many UCL academics feared that\nit would leave many of their scientists\nwithout jobs, whereas Imperial\u2019s staff\nwould suffer far less.\nSince the introduction of the Further\nand Higher Education Act in 1992, the\nUK has seen the creation of some 60\nnew universities. The current number\nof higher education institutions,\naccording to the University and College\nAdmissions Service, is 325, which goes\na long way to helping the government\nreach their 2010 target of having 50%\nof 18-30 year olds in higher education.\nThe current financial state of\nuniversities was also one of the topics\nof discussion in Lammy\u2019s speech. Many\nuniversities rely on student fees to\nremain financially viable, though many\nhave already claimed that this model\nis not a feasible one, with Lammy\nbelieving that it is unsustainable. Topup fees were introduced back in 2006,\nafter much complaint, with students\npaying around \u00a33,000 per an academic\nyear. Indeed Sir Richard commented\nlast October that he is in support of\nincreasing Top-up fees to \u00a35,000 after\nthe 2009 review. Lammy, himself, is a\ngraduate of the School of Oriental and\nAfrican Studies (University of London)\nand Harvard Law School, regularly\nreceiving requests for donations from\nthe latter. Contributions from alumni\nare a source of funding the minister\nhighlighted for future consideration\nby UK universities. The views of the\ncurrent Rector, Sir Roy Anderson, are\nas yet still unknown; however, he did\ncomment in his Commemoration Day\nspeech that entrance exams will be\nbrought in by 2010, in response to the\ncurrent number of applications where\nhe said that \u201cwe cannot continue on\nthis path\u201d.\nContradicting government policy,\nJohn Denham, Secretary of State for\nInnovation, Universities and Skills,\nsaid in August this year: \u201cThere are\ncertainly young people who currently\ngo to university who would have been\nbetter off on an advanced apprentice-ship. We have been in danger of making it sound as if university is the only\nreal aspiration.\u201d\nThis echoes the view of Sir Richard\nwho said last October that \u201cthe system\nhas to change. It will then make people think twice before they go off and\ndo those damn silly courses that are\nno good to them and won\u2019t get them a\ngood job at the end of the day. It would\nmean university is not just a nice four\nyears off.\u201d\nThis Wednesday, the Government\nannounced they will be cutting student grants after discovering a \u00a3200m\nfunding shortfall.

It\u2019s election time in\nthe United States, in case you hadn\u2019t\nnoticed, and last week\u2019s wildly successful thematic crossword has inspired\nme to go crazy again.\nPay attention, though, because I\u2019m\nonly going to say this once. There are\nno across or down clues this week,\nonly state names. You have to decide\nwhether a state will swing republican\nor democrat \u2013 if republican the word\ngoes down, if democrat the word goes\nacross. My predictions, of course, are\nopen to human error.\nTo help you out, the letters of the\nwords, taken in normal numbering or-der, spell out a prophecy of Nostradamian proportions.\nOh, and one more thing: www.cross-word.info/Enoch\nEnoch\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n38 Friday 31 October 2008\nfelix\nSport\n39\nfelix\nFriday 31 October 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nTable tennis\nThe Men\u2019s 1st team travelled to UCL\nto begin their campaign for the new\nseason. The BUCS South Eastern Conference has been reshuffled into two\ntiers of 6 teams with IC in the upper\ntier. The team itself has a new look\nabout it as well, with Darius Atashroo,\nHua Aun Tan and Heng Kai Lee coming in to replace departees Kevin Kan,\nGaetan Gourmelon, Jerry Liu and club\nstalwart, Wei Lun Wong who have all\ngraduated. The four to face UCL consisted of the aforementioned newcomers plus Eddie Liu.\nThe match was pretty much inci-dent-free, though Hua Aun did endure\na short time-out to the First Aid room\nduring his second match, after cutting his thumb on the edge of the table\nfrom his own rasping forehand win-ner. Despite being hampered in playing some of his shots, Hua Aun and\nindeed IC looked to have the beating\nof our London rivals. Though with the\nscoreline tied at 4-4 as we approached\nthe halfway mark, things were getting\ntense. Eddie and Darius had both lost\nout to UCL\u2019s number 1 in hard-fought\nmatches which could\u2019ve easily gone the\nother way. Still, encouragingly all 4 IC\nplayers managed to register 1 win each\nfrom the opening 2 rounds of games,\nand this confidence boost would prove\nto provide the spark which would\nsee us safely to victory in the closing\nstages, with IC winning 6 of the final\n8 singles.\nWhat was also quite nice was by the\nend of the evening all the noise was\ncoming from the Imperial corner and\nwe felt like the home team. Well, home\nadvantage doesn\u2019t count for much in\ntable tennis, except where dodgy lighting and tables are concerned. But any-way, the guys had the crowd support\nfrom what seemed to be their own\npersonal cheerleaders - actually, it was\njust Darius\u2019 young lady friend and this\nother girl who happened to be there\n(don\u2019t know her story, but she decided\nto support us). It was much appreci-ated. Darius and Eddie rounded off the\nevening by taking the doubles and so it\nfinished 11-6 to Imperial.\nCredit must go to both teams for\nplaying a very sporting match and we\u2019ll\nlook forward to hosting UCL in the return fixture. Next up is a home game\nagainst LSE, who are traditionally a\nstrong side, so it will surely be an intriguing contest.\nSaturday 25th October\nFootball\nMen\u2019s 1s ULU 5-2 Imperial College 2s ULU\nMen\u2019s 3s ULU 1-0 St George\u2019s 1s ULU\nMen\u2019s 5s ULU 4-0 Royal Holloway 4s ULU\nMen\u2019s 6s ULU 5-1 RUMS 4s ULU\nMen\u2019s 7s ULU 2-3 St George\u2019s 3s ULU\nSunday 26th October\nHockey\nMen\u2019s 2s ULU 5-0 Royal Holloway 2s ULU\nMen\u2019s 4s ULU 1-5 RUMS 2s ULU\nLacrosse\nMixed 1s ULU 17-3 UCL Mixed 2s ULU\nRugby\nWomen\u2019s 1s ULU 0-47 UCL 1s ULU\nMonday 27th October\nNetball\nWomen\u2019s 1s ULU 11-38 King\u2019s College 1s ULU\nWomen\u2019s 2s ULU 39-28 Queen Mary 2s ULU\n\t\t\nSquash\nMen\u2019s 1s ULU 5-3 King\u2019s College 1s ULU\nWomen\u2019s 1s ULU 8-0 UCL 1s ULU\nWater Polo\nMixed 1s ULU 7-9 St Barts Mixed 1s ULU\nWednesday 29th October\nBadminton\nMen\u2019s 1st 5-3 University of Hertfordshire 1st\nWomen\u2019s 1st 8-0 Imperial Medicals 1st\nFencing\nMen\u2019s 1st 135-79 University of Surrey 1st\nFootball\nMen\u2019s 1st 7-1 Universities at Medway 1st\nMen\u2019s 2nd 3-1 Roehampton University 2nd\nMen\u2019s 4s ULU 3-1 RVC 1s ULU\nMen\u2019s 5s ULU 4-4 King\u2019s Medicals 3s ULU\nMen\u2019s 6s ULU 2-3 Queen Mary 5s ULU\nMen\u2019s 7s ULU 3-0 Heythrop College 1s ULU\nHockey\nMen\u2019s 1st 8-0 UCL 2nd\nMen\u2019s 2nd 5-4 University of Brighton 2nd\nMen\u2019s 3rd 4-0 Imperial Medicals 3rd\nMen\u2019s 4th 1-10 University of Reading 1st Men\u2019s\nWomen\u2019s 1st 5-1 LSE 1st\nWomen\u2019s 2nd 0-8 UCL 2nd\nNetball\nWomen\u2019s 3rd 20-35 University of Chichester 3rd\nRugby\nMen\u2019s 1st 10-78 Oxford University Greyhounds\nMen\u2019s 3rd 12-5 University of Surrey 2nd\nMen\u2019s 4th 27-34 University of Kent 2nd\nSquash\nMen\u2019s 1st 3-2 UCL 1st\nWomen\u2019s 1st 2-2 University of Reading 1st\nTable Tennis\nMen\u2019s 1st 15-2 University of Reading 1st\nSaturday 1st November\nFootball\nMen\u2019s 1s ULU vs UCL 2s ULU\nMen\u2019s 3s ULU vs Queen Mary 2s ULU\nMen\u2019s 4s ULU vs UCL 6s ULU\nMen\u2019s 5s ULU vs RVC 1s ULU\nMen\u2019s 6s ULU vs Goldsmiths 2s ULU\nSunday 2nd November\nBasketball\nWomen\u2019s 1s vs Royal Holloway 1s ULU\nFootball\nWomen\u2019s 1s ULU vs LSE 1s ULU\nLacrosse\t\t\t\t\nMixed 1s ULU vs Royal Holloway Mixed 1s ULU\nRguby\nWomen\u2019s 1s ULU vs St George\u2019s 1s ULU\nMonday 3rd Novmber\nNetball\nWomen\u2019s 3s ULU vs LSE 5s ULU\nFixtures & Results in association with Sports Partnership\nAlabama\nAlaska\nArizona\nColorado\nDelaware\nGeorgia\nHawaii\nIdaho\nIllinois\nKansas\nMaine\nMichigan\nMinnesota\nMissouri\nNebraska\nNew Jersey\nNew York\nNorth Dakota\nOklahoma\nOregon\nSouth Dakota\nTennessee\nTexas\nUtah\nVermont\nVirginia\nWisconsin\nWyoming\nA person from Barcelona and Paris gets the travelling bug,...

Clearly the excitement was too much for fresher\nHarriet as shortly after she forgot she\nwas playing hockey and rugby tackled\nan opposition player to the ground in\npursuit of the ball. At half time we\nwere equal footing, something quickly\nrectified with fresher Teddy, putting us\n2-1 ahead. Teddy was later heard to\nsay \u2018it felt pretty good\u2019 although whether this was in reference to the goal or\nactivities engaged in with certain male\nhockey players we can only speculate.\nOur lead was short lived as some disarray whilst subbing lead to a sneaky\ngoal from the opposition. Perhaps the\nfrustration was getting to the freshers\nat this point as Teddy was soon green\ncarded for attacking from behind, and\nHarriet missed a one-on-one chance\nwith the keeper.\nThankfully, the older members of\nthe team held it together, Dominator\nSarah Clayton & Elliot Dyke marking out the player from an attacking run with MJ executing a stunning\nslide tackle to block a potential shot\n(MJ also managed to hold herself together with no dislocated shoulder to\nreport this time). The ball was quickly\ncleared and after an awesome cross\nfrom Malvinas, was flicked on by Teddy, with a cheeky last minute deflection\nfrom fresher Wide-Open to bring us\nback ahead 3-1. IC kept the pressure\nup, with Token Lezza working the new\ndiamond formation, until Fresher Sam\nfound the back of the net. 4-2 with ten\nminutes to go the IC defence withstood\nfresh onslaughts from the opposition,\nfresher Chealsea managing to disrupt\nplay every time she touched the ball.\nThen in the final two minutes WideOpen was sent off for repeated stick\ntackles, leaving a depleted IC team to\nhold the visitors at bay and secure our\nfirst victory of the season.\nSpecial thanks to fresher Katie who\ncame to support in spite of her pneu-monia, and the mens 3\u2019s for providing\npost match naked entertainment.\nSo the Ladies elite were a success,\nbut what about the Gentlemen\u2019s social\nelite!\nThis game had the makings of a classic after previous encounters in recent\nyears where results have been good for\nboth sides. RUMS started the game in\na brisk fashion scoring early on with a\nwellworkedsoloeffortfromtheirno.10,\nwho had clearly played at a higher level\nbefore.

Inclusion of 25m sprints\nalongside 50m and 100m events meant\nplenty of chances for all to gain valuable competitive experience. Storming\nswims included sibling rivalry from\nthe Monaghan sisters and Tom W-C\nSwim & Water\nPolo prepare for\nBUCS\nswimming his BP in the 100 Fly, an impressive feat so early in the season.\nSaturday gave swimmers a chance\nto venture further afield. Cambridge\nUniversity Swim and Water Polo Club\nhosted their annual Relays Gala. This\ngala features relays in all strokes, obliging competitors to swim outside their\nfavoured disciplines. The events culminated in an 8 x 50m mixed relay in\nwhich a striking display of team camaraderie resulted in domination over\nour rivals, Kings.\nThe evening didn\u2019t end there as we\nheaded to one of Cambridge\u2019s favourite clubs for food, drink and dancing\u2026\nand didn\u2019t make it home until the wee\nsmall hours.

Fish\nLast Saturday, the discDoctors (dD)\nwent to a beginners\u2019 tournament held\nin Loughborough. In the past it has\nbeen a cracking tournament, starting\nthe year on a high note and allowing\nthe freshers to discover what competitive ultimate is like while having a lot\nof fun as well.\nA few of the freshers were concerned\nthat their throws weren\u2019t good enough,\nlast year\u2019s cup defeat, RUMS continued\nto press forward and were rewarded\nmidway into the first half with 2 quick\nfire goals that called for Imperial 4s,\na.k.a. the DeIViants, to ring a few\nchanges in the defence, most notably\nwith the introduction of Harry, who\ntook up a sweeping role, to man mark\nno.10. This sparked a revival from Imperial with several counter attacks and\nwell worked passing moves involving\nAl, Luke, Rob, Doug and James to get\nback into the game. RUMS were on the\nback foot and just before the half was\nup Imperial took advantage of some\nshort corners to win a p.flick which Al\nthen dispatched with style, aiming for\nthe bottom corner with the ball ending up straight down the middle. In the\nsecond half Imperial sensed a comeback was on the cards and should have\nreduced the deficit further. Unfortunately for Imperial, this was not to be\nand risks had to be taken at the back\nallowing RUMS to break dangerously,\non several occasions, resulting in two\nmore goals. One where keeper Alex restrained himself from one of his Superman dives and their striker was quick\nto finish, the other was a rebound from\na deft shot which had struck the post.\nImperial continued to play with an attacking mentality but in the end RUMS\ncame away deserved winners of what\nwas an exciting game!\nWith success across all teams so far\nthis year, it is now the turn of the touring squad that will venture to Brighton this weekend for fun, frolics and\nchampagne hockey.

But their\nfears were allayed when I admitted I\ndidn\u2019t understand the game either and\nI\u2019ve been playing for ages. With respect\nduly won from said freshers we all got\nthe train to Lufbra where on arrival we\ndumped our stuff where all the other\nteams were staying and headed off\nfor food and more drinking. We were\nscheduled to play six short games during the day and we arrived at the sports\nhall in the morning optimistic of improving on our 18th seeding. The optimism didn\u2019t last long as we were beaten 7-0 by Haze 2 (the Loughborough\nteam) but we rallied magnificently to\nwin 4-3 against Leicester, 5-3 against\nBradford, 7-3 against Aberystwyth and\n5-2 against Bangor. We lost a crucial\ngame against Airwolf 3-2 and so confined ourselves to the bottom half of the\n28 team tournament. With the games\nover for the day, we had got ourselves\nready for the party. It was fancy dress\nand we went in budget-we-bought-this-from-Primark/Camden army gear.\nThink fake blood, ripped manky green\ntops and an inflatable gun. We picked\nup the best 3 pint challenge time and\nhad a great time in their union among\nthe ridiculously dressed before calling\nit a night in the early morning.\nWe awoke nursing our morning stiffness and groggy heads and got ready to\nplay three slightly longer games. With\nonly 3 games we couldn\u2019t afford to\nwaste time playing ourselves into form.\nThankfully our first game was against\nsome kids and we trounced them 8-1.\nNext up was Leicester again and this\nmatch was also a close affair with a\nmammoth point at the end that we just\nsnatched to win 3-2. Our last match\nwas effectively our final and we really\nhoped to win it but we were outplayed\nby a good Durham team and lost 5-1.\nNevertheless the weekend was great\nfun and every beginner improved sub-stantially.

    "content": "I\nmagine This is set in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Second\nWorld War, a period of turmoil and terror for Jewish communities under Nazi-occupation. Its characters are some of those\ncaught up in Hitler\u2019s plot to kill all Jews, trying to carry on\nwith normal life. We are introduced to the Warshowskys, a\nfamily running a company of actors in the ghetto, putting on a\nproduction of Masada whilst facing imminent deportation. But\nhow close is the story of Imagine This to the real experiences of\nthose in the Warsaw Ghetto? Could culture survive in such a harrowing location?\nWork on ghettoising Warsaw began in October 1940 with 113,000\nPoles being removed. The ghetto was closed off to the rest of the city\non November 16th, 1940 with 440,000 Jews crammed into less than\nthree square miles of city, enclosed by a wall of brick and barbed\nwire protected by armed guards. Inside the ghetto the remnants of\na city remained with its occupants trying to maintain normality as\nmuch as possible - adults still went to work, children went to school\nand cafes were still open (if you\u2019ve seen The Pianist, you\u2019ll remember the main character W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman works as a pianist in an\nupper-class restaurant). As the war went on and more Jews from\nall over Poland were transported to the Ghetto, conditions became\nmuch worse. Disease and famine became rife. Jews were limited\nto just 253 calories a day. The Nazis also started instigating random\nkillings. Despite this, the occupants tried to deal with the situation as\nbest they could, opening soup kitchens, a school system and even\na symphony orchestra!\nIn 1942, the ghetto began to empty with the mass deportation of\nits residents to extermination camps such as Treblinka. In an effort\nto save themselves, the residents started to fight back during what is\nnow known as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. During the early part of\n1943, Jews started to refuse to be moved, leading to the final battle\non Passover of 1943. The resistance ended on April 23rd with demolition of the Great Synagogue marking the removal of the ghetto on\nMay 16th 1943.\nSo what about culture within the ghetto? Well, it did exist thanks to\nthe \u201cYiddishe Kultur Organizatsye\u201d. The ghetto contained Jews from\nall walks of life, including some famous Jewish actors such as Zigmunt Turkow, who appeared in films like \u201cThe Vow\u201d and \u201cJolly Paupers\u201d before the war and his wife, Diana Blumenfeld (both survived\nthe war). The journal of Emanuel Ringelblum, another occupant of\nthe ghetto, confirms that Diana Blumenfeld performed in a play he\nsaw on 11 December 1940. As previously mentioned, there was also\nan eighty-member symphony orchestra conducted by Simon Pullman that ran for two years before the entire company was sent to\nTreblinka in August 1942. Among other cultural highlights was the\nchildrens\u2019 choir who sang to raise money for their orphanages and\nschools and various amateur comedy nights.\nI\nmust admit I got a bit overexcit-ed when I was invited to watch\na rehearsal of a new musical;\nit\u2019s a bit like musical theatre\ngeek heaven. Even before\nI got to the auditorium, I found\nmyself crammed in a lift with\ntwo of the actors from the\nshow (exciting!) and we got\ntalking. It turns out that\nS\u00e9van Stephan studied\nMaths at Imperial in the\nnineties - see scientists,\nyou too, can become a West\nEnd performer!\nAs I settled down in my\ncentre stall seat (that\u2019s the\ngreat thing about rehearsals,\nyou can sit wherever you want),\nI was taken aback by the set.\nEugene Lee really has pulled out\nall the stops. The setting is an old\nfactory that has been ripped apart\nby the Nazis so all the glass is broken\nand the bricks are covered in dirt. This\ncreated a feeling of unease, as if the\nNazis could burst in at any time, especially with so many exits, entrances\nand stairs dotted around in hidden ar-eas. The set extends across the entire\nfront of the theatre, creating an intimate yet all-encompassing feel. Even\nthe orchestra are concealed by this\nvast expanse. The costumes, despite not all being finished, had a\nsense of faded glory about them -brightly coloured rags tainted with\ndirt or rips. Although they didn\u2019t\nquite seem to fit with the set, the\ncostumes still worked on a storytelling level.\nThe cast was working on the\nsong \u201cMasada\u201d, part of the\ncompany\u2019s play.From what\nI was told, \u201cMasada\u201d is\nan ancient story of Jewish persecution by the\nRomans and their fight\nback and so, is echoing\nthe situation the characters\nfind themselves in. This number\ntakes full advantage of a bridging walkway about 6 feet above the stage with\nthe \u201cJews\u201d above and the \u201cRomans\u201d be-low. It also takes advantage of the built-in revolve, that the New London theatre has had since Cats had its colossal\n21 year run, with some nifty choreography involving dying Romans. One\nexciting aspect of being in the tech\nrehearsal was how aspects of the show\nwere rapidly being altered around me.\nThe director was playing around with\ndifferent positions and poses whilst the\nchoreographer tweaked specific move-ments. The choreography looked\ncomplex enough to keep my attention\nwithout removing too much of the focus from the main characters singing\nabove. When the company started to\nsing, I was taken away. The melody was\nrich, with Peter Polycarpou\u2019s booming\ncries of \u201cMasada\u201d supported by a very\n\u2018Les Mis-like\u2019 chorus backing, and\nthe harmonies were breathtaking. For\nsome reason, when I hear a good harmony I can\u2019t stop smiling. Well, I didn\u2019t\nstop beaming throughout the song.\nThe entire setup of the song created\nan atmosphere of both tension and op-timism, which I hope can be carried on\nthroughout the rest of the play. From\nthe songs I have heard at the tech rehearsal and on the website, the music\nsounds flowing and lyrical, and works\nwith the themes of the play. The principals seem to really fit their roles and\nsang very well, despite this being a\nrehearsal to get the lights and the set\nright, rather than the notes. In their\ndowntime, the cast appear to get on\nreally well, which I think will be effective in creating realistic relationships\nbetween the characters in the show.\nA sneaky look at what the\nshow has to offer\nThe unexpected\nartists of the\nWarsaw Ghetto\nThe felix Arts pages managed to bag not only a snoop at a rehearsal of new musical Imagine This, but also\nan interview with producer Beth Trachtenberg. Our resident musical fanatic Lucy Harrold reports back\n\u201cThis is my pointing-into-the-distance-at-nothing pose,\u201d \u201cLovely dear.\u201d\nAfter doing a bit of digging around\nfor reviews of the Theatre Royal Plymouth tryout, I really hope that the\nbook of the musical has improved.\nSome have said that this will be the element of the show that will let it down,\n- the Plymouth book was reported to\nbe clich\u00e9d and corny - but this was not\nobvious in the part of the show that I\nsaw, so let\u2019s hope there has been a serious rewrite.\nImagine This opens on 19 November so go forth, reader, and book\nyour tickets!\nI\ndon\u2019t know what I was expecting when I was given the opportunity to interview Beth, one of\nthe producers of Imagine This.\nI was told she was a smoker\nand a \u201creal character\u201d so I expected a\nbig ballsy woman with booming voice\nand attitude to match. Instead, I was\ngreeted by a very nice and friendly\nAmerican who is on first-name terms\nwith all, and generally seemed happy\nto be here. We settled down in the\nstalls of the New London, surrounded\nby an ensuing technical rehearsal to\ndiscuss Imagine This, her experiences\nproducing it and the general London\ntheatre scene\u2026\nAs we entered the auditorium I\nwas struck by the vast and intricate set. How did you come to\nthis design?\nWe originally planned for a proscenium arch theatre, so we had to change\nto this altogether different layout (the\nNew London stage stretches all the\nway across the front of the theatre),\nbut we have found it now works in our\nfavour. There are lots of hidden spaces,\ndoors and staircases making it very\natmospheric and intimate. Our de-signer, Eugene Lee (designer for shows\nlike Wicked and the original Sweeney\nTodd) was chosen before we knew the\nrestrictions, but he really has a great\nsense of the space.\nTell me about the play.itself and\nthe misconceptions surrounding\nit\nImagine This is not the Holocaust\nmusical as many have perceived. Although it is set in the Warsaw Ghetto,\nit is more about the play being put on\nby the actors in the Ghetto and how\nhistory can repeat itself. It is about human beings that could be your neigh-bours, your friends or your family. By\nan evil fate, they have found themselves\nin these circumstances but continue\nto live their lives and never lose sight\nof the future and hope. These people\nare role models; they have the strength\nand belief in the future to fall in love in\nthe Warsaw Ghetto\nThe show examines how people\nfaced with extraordinary choices make\nthemselves heroes, it echoes the situations in Darfur, Somalia and anywhere\npeople are hated for no reason.\nWhat is the role of art and culture\nin the show?\nThe wonder of the story is that the\nGhetto was the last bastion of Yiddish\nculture and culture is what keeps us\nhuman.\nThis is you first musical, so why\nnow and why this show?\nI\u2019ve always loved musical theatre but\nnever had ambitions to produce it - my\nbackground is in film and television. A\nproducer friend recommended the CD\nthree years ago and, not wanting to be\nrude, I just shoved it on whilst in the\ncar. I didn\u2019t want to leave the car! The\nsongs were emotion-provoking and the\nlyrics intelligent enough to treat the\nlistener with respect. I was taken by\nGlenn Berenbeim\u2019s perception of the\nsimilarities between the Nazi persecution of the Jews and their persecution\nin Masada (the play being put on by the\ncompany); he recognised the overarch-ing themes.\nWhat differences did you find\nbetween film production and\nmusical production?\nIn both forms of producing, you are\nworking with creative talent but the\nfinancial side structure differs. In film\nand television, it is easy to go to agencies or companies for money and get\nit, whereas in an artform that tends to\nfail, like musical theatre, it is harder.\nHowever, we have an amazing investor\ngroup from all different walks of life\nwho have invested because they have\nfallen in love with the show.\nWhy do you believe in this show\nso much?\nImagine This has a lot to say and\nteach us but it is still entertainment,\nentertainment that will inspire its audi-ence. The score is lush, flowing, lyrical\nand difficult to forget - the musical will\nlive on even after you leave the thea-tre. I\u2019ll never forget seeing those classic\nshows like Les Miserable and My Fair\nLady. I want Imagine This to be one of\nthose shows.\nImagine This started as a workshop and then a tryout in Plymouth. How did it benefit from\nthis?\nWe started as a workshop in\nShoreditch Town Hall with twenty\npeople in black t-shirts, a narrator, a\npiano and guitar. The Theatre Royal,\nPlymouth got on board and we spent\ntwo and a half weeks there. The big\nadvantage of opening in Plymouth was\nthat it is totally un-urban and so if the\nshow could work there, it could work\nanywhere. The best critics are your audience - they are another actor and a\npart of the show, if the actors on stage\ncan\u2019t dialogue with the audience you\nhave no show.\nAfter Plymouth, we had a lot of work\nto do but knew exactly what to do. For\nexample, the opening number was\nnever in the Plymouth production and\nI can\u2019t imagine the show without it.\nHow do you feel about coming\ninto a West End that has been\nhit with a series of flop new\nmusicals?\nThere is nothing more thrilling than\nseeing the product of talented imagi-nations; a show not based on a film or\na book, and I think audiences will be\nthrilled to see a new show too. If we\ndon\u2019t create new shows, what will have\nto be revived? The fact that the season\nis full of revivals is evidence of this.\nIs it a challenge? Absolutely, I can\nunderstand that people can only afford\nto see one or two shows a year now.\nHopefully, this show will be their treat;\nI have a lot of faith in that.\nHow do other recent Holocaustbased pieces such as God on Trial\ncompare to Imagine This?\nGod on Trial was a spectacular\ndrama and had the intellectual excitement of Imagine This but I don\u2019t think\nI would be able to put on this musical\nif it was set in a concentration camp.\nImagine This differs from other pieces\nbecause it is not about the Nazis, but\nabout who the Jews were. We have the\nresponsibility to those who were in the\nProducer Beth\nTrachtenberg talks to felix\nThe promotion poster - the rose quite clearly says \u201cclassy\u201d. If you want this in flash-animated, tinkling\nmusic form, we heartily recommend the production\u2019s website. It caused minor a stir in the felix office.\nThis smart chap is one of the main characters, Daniel Warshowsky, who puts on a theatrical production in\nthe Warsaw Ghetto, played by Peter Polycarpou. We nod in the general direction of his very fine hat.\nGhetto to tell their story, a responsibility everyone working on the show\ntakes very seriously. If we did not, it\nwould be a betrayal of everything they\nlived and died for. As we started the rehearsal period we discovered that one\nof our ensemble members, Roy Litvin\u2019s\ngrandparents had been caught up in\nthe Holocaust and his grandmother\nsurvived Auschwitz. So this process\nhas been particularly meaningful to\nhim.\nDo you see Imagine This transferring to other countries?\nIf it is a success, definitely. It is\na universal story that resonates with everyone.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if\nsomeone doesn\u2019t\nunderstand the\nlanguage or if the\nlyrics are trans-lated, the music is beautiful\nenough to carry the show.\n, a double page spread on hot new musical\n\n"

Last year, the Imperial Islamic society raised\naround \u00a311,000. However charity week is not limited to Imperial\nand runs at universities across the country, last year\u2019s charity weeks\ncombined raised an incredible \u00a3250,000.\nMoney raising events this week included rattling donation tins\naround campus and at tube stations, selling delicious Hummingbird\ncakes, handing out goody bags of items donated by companies and\nturning up to lectures in ridiculous outfits.\nIn Islamic tradition, the best people are those that serve others,\ngoing out of their way to help someone, regardless of race or creed.\nMembers of the society feel it is important to raise money for charity,\nwhen you stop and consider how many children there are worldwide that are less fortunate than ourselves.\nSpecial mention goes to the 2nd year medics, who raised \u00a3300 in\ntwo days and Boots have offered to double what ever they raise.\nThe journey to Snowdonia started like\nany other. Everything was going well\nuntil the planned dinner stop, we had\ngiven Dave the map and as usual, Captain Incompetent got us lost. Everyone\nhad a great tour of Warwick, especially\nthe central roundabout that we saw 6\ntimes. Not the sort of views we were\nexpecting for a hiking trip. Decisions\nwere made and the quorum decided\nthat henceforth, Gareth would take on\nnavigational duties and Dave\u2019s committee role would involve watching kettles\nboil and making tea.\nDespite Dave\u2019s best (or worst?) map\nreading efforts the hut eventually\nloomed out of the darkness and everyone settled down in anticipation of a\ngood weekend in the mountains. And\nwhat a weekend it was! Saturday morning saw the group burning clutches as\nAlex brought the bus to a stuttering halt\nin Pen-y-Pass before the hiking start-ed. It was decided to send two groups,\none up the knife-edge summit of Crib\nGoch (923m) and another around part\nof the Horseshoe (898m). Both groups\nfared well through the mist and fog\nand managed to summit around mid-day, just in time for the wind, rain and\ngloom that so often envelops Wales to\nroll in. Crib Goch was particularly im-pressive, a group of 12 scrambled and\nbattled their way across the exposed\nridge while taking in awesome views\n(whenever the poor weather abated).\nThe hike off the mountain was then\na slightly depressed affair after a frenzied morning, both groups opting to\nfollow easy routes down the Pyg and\nLlanberis tracks to avoid the worst of\nthe rain and the freezing winds blowing about the mountain in the early\nafternoon. All was washed down with\na mug from Pete\u2019s Eats.\nThe worst of the weather was predicted for Sunday and as such Alex\nsuggested a low level walk in the trees\nof Beddgelert as a relaxing way to avoid\nthe rain and 40mph winds in the mountain heights. This was quickly accepted\nas a good idea and off the group went,\ndespite Nathaniel getting lost on the\nway to the car park and asking someone where it was, while he was standing in it. Eventually the hike started in\na picturesque forest fresh from the dew\nand rainfall of the day before. Everything was going to plan until Nathaniel decided to explore a white hill area\non the map. This white area lead the\ngroup through several hours of boggy\nheath often several feet deep in places.\nNeedless to say the day very quickly\nbecame a wet and soggy affair and morale dropped. A quick route to the buses was needed and Nathaniel gave another less than stellar performance by\nWhat\u2019s on\nComing next week:\nPicture of the Week\nXimen Shopping District, by Laurence Lai\n3rd year Aeronautics\nWe want to exhibit your art.

Either way, Dave\neventually found the buses and all was\nwell again.\nThe journey home passed quickly\nuntil the group reached the Malt Shovel in Gaydon for dinner, Tony-Ten-Bellies earning his nickname from the five\ndifferent dishes he requested (and ate\nthe majority of).\nIf you fancy a trip to the countryside any time soon, come and\njoin us; 12:30 in Beit Quad on a\nTuesday.\nIslamic Society Charity Week 2008\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on\u201d is a weekly calendar of upcoming Club & Society events.\nIt is a chance for Clubs & Societies to publicise events in Felix and will\ncover events running from Monday-Sunday.

High fives for all. DiFranco\nreceives yet another happy letter and the puppets come out of the dark shadows...\nM\nusicisanintegralpart\nof any film, be it an\nimmense movie or a\nlousy one, we cannot\nwatch a film without\nhearing the inherent soundtrack behind it. Unless it is a silent movie of\ncourse, Charlie Chaplin being the ultimate icon of this genre, then I might as\nwell be deaf as a bat. My ears are given\na nice nap when this little man steps\nonto the big silver screen. It is with\ngreat sadness that I say I don\u2019t really get\nthis whole silent thing, you see, without music, without dialogue, it\u2019s rather\nbanal. Although, there are silent films\nthat are admittedly extremely poignant\nand successful. Just not that many.\nTo me, when a film is finished, I immediately make a judgement of it based\non how good the soundtrack is. I know\nit is rather stereotypical of me, being\na music critic, to focus deeply on the\nsoundscapes that encompass the film,\nbut I cannot help being infatuated with\nsomething that has a terrific musical\nbackdrop to it.\nTake the blockbuster \u2018Titanic\u2019 for\ninstance; some say it\u2019s cheesy, mushy\nand over dramatic, but the film would\nnot have been half as astoundingly\nsuccessful if it had not been for James\nHorner\u2019s dynamite score that blew audiences away worldwide. I was one of\nthem. I\u2019m not ashamed to say that it\nwas this mesmerising score that struck\na cord within me and inspired me to\nlearn to play piano and to love and appreciate music for what it is and what\nit can do for people.\nBeing a girl who likes a bit of everything except horror, I confess to having\ncountless favourite film soundtracks.\nGirly films with ravishing music scores\ninclude \u2018Moulin Rouge\u2019, with the gorgeous Ewan McGregor (who sings and\nacts splendidly), and \u2018Pearl Harbour\u2019,\nwhich made me think how tragic it\nwould be to first fall for someone, to\nlose them and then to fall for another\nand then to lose them again (heart-breaking really).\n\u2018Love Actually\u2019 with the Christmas\nfeel and \u2018Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary\u2019 with its\npowerful independent-woman floor-fillers and sad lonely tunes like \u201cAll by\nMyself\u201d. \u2018Romeo and Juliet\u2019 with the\nmixture of true sweetness \u2013 Des\u2019ree\u2019s\nheavenly \u201cKissing You,\u201d Gavin Friday\u2019s\n\u201cAngel,\u201d and the rage and desolation\nthat engulfs the Montagues and Capulets is finely captured by the thundering dramatic instrumentation. Other\ntimeless beauties include \u2018The Lord of\nthe Rings\u2019 by Howard Shore, \u2018Gladiator\u2019 by Hans Zimmer, \u2018Crouching Tiger\nHidden Dragon\u2019, \u2018Top Gun\u2019 with the\nclassic \u201cTake My Breath Away,\u201d \u2018Kill\nBill\u2019 and the explosively groovy theme\ntune of \u2018Mission Impossible\u2019 which has\nyou geared up for action.\nTruth be told, the music scores for\nthese films are as epic as the films\nthemselves and the themes present,\nthey evoke fireworks that etch lasting\nimprints of the unforgettable scenes.\nI hope I have expounded enough on\nthe notion of how critical film soundtracks are. Without them good movies\nwill become mediocre and bad movies,\nwell, they need to be hung, drawn and\nquartered.\nThe Verve frontman Richard Ashcroft clearly having a blast,-\u2019Cos love is noise, love is pain, love is...\u2019\nAlbum Review\nThe Verve\nForth\nHHHHI\nSusan Yu\nThe Verve have been rocketing on\nstage this summer with countless festivals in the bag including V, Glastonbury and T in the Park. Back with bra-vado. Being the \u2018Forth\u2019 album, a rather\nsimple pun of a title has been chosen.\nAre these guys back on form with this\nnumber one album? The majority say\nyes. We\u2019ll see.\nAfter spending the past decade clearing his closet of inner demons through\nthe release of several solo albums, Richard Ashcroft returns with a venge-ance, reuniting with the band and\ndemonstrating his showmanship and\nmemorable vocals. Taking you back to\nthe good old nineties when you readers were still probably happily cracking gum, bunking off school, playing\npranks on teachers, making paper\naeroplanes and flirting with the boy/\ngirl from across the classroom. Now,\nit is almost a decade into the new millennium and do we hear a new sound\naltogether? No, but we do hear traces\nof their old brilliance.\nFirst on the list is \u2018Sit and Wonder,\u2019\na song that is full of heavy instrumentation and layers, with sharp, almost\nshrill, electric guitar riffs. The harsh,\nmetallic soundscape pervades haunt-ingly, resonating with the pained\nvocals that hears Ashcroft wailing,\nstraining for attention, doped with\ndesperation, frustration and need-\u2018And\nshe\u2019s the teacher and I\u2019m the pupil and\nain\u2019t learning nothing at all.\u2019 \u2018Yeah I sit\nand wonder, I fall to pieces, I\u2019ve been\nwaiting for her to come.\u2019 Now, this is\none hell of a desperate kid. The sound-scape stretches and builds gradually,\nsucked into this black whirlpool mesh\nof ambient sounds.\nNext we have the outstanding \u2018Love\nis Noise,\u2019 being a number one hit single that is a true anthem. It has this\npulsating \u2018ah oh\u2019 echoing chant that is\npresent throughout the entire track,\nlooping round and round. The interesting dabble of the bleeping synthesizer in this track helps to compound\nthe sonic landscape, whilst McCabe\u2019s\ndescending guitar-riff gently complements the bittersweet vocals. Without\na doubt, the instantly memorable chorus is a testimony to Ashcroft\u2019s poetic\nprowess- \u2018Are we blind - can we see?\u2019\nhe asks, wanting everybody to feel his\npain all over again, -\u2018We are one \u2013 in-complete, are we blind - in the shade.\u2019\n\u2018Cause love is noise and love is pain,\nLove is these blues that I\u2019m singing\nagain.\u2019 Simple but poignant lyrics that\nare repeated over and over like a mantra that gets nailed into your brains\u2026\nThen we have the head-nodding\n\u2018Rather Be,\u2019 with its extensive orchestral\naccompaniment that sees a pleasant\ndose of strings coming back. With it,\nthere are soulful female backing vocals\nthat butters up the saccharine piece. In\nconjunction, we have the return of laid-back beats that are deeply reminiscent\nof the band\u2019s old tracks like the arche-typical classic-\u2018Bittersweet Symphony.\u2019\nNext comes \u2018Judas,\u2019 the one that betrayed them all. \u2018Feelings. Just Feelings.\nJust let it go\u2019 he croons. This is a slower\ncontrasting number that follows the\ngiddy headiness that is \u2018Love is Noise.\u2019\nTinklings of piano fade in from time to\ntime with various synthesised sounds\nricocheting off, adding sprinkles of\ntenderness and delicacy to the track\njust for good measure. Here, we do get\nto hear McCabe show off his expertise\nwith complex fingerwork on the frets.\nWe all wish we could play the guitar\nhalf as good as him\u2026\nOn the whole, the band seems to\nadhere to the majestic rock and roll\nassault of their iconic \u2018Urban Hymns\u2019\nalbum, from the ancient times of the\nnineties. But, this time round, the fire\nis burning a tad less brightly, or maybe\nwe are just a little bit older and slightly\nmore desensitised to the whole music\nbusiness. Who knows. Does music\never lose its potency? Never. Sometimes. Maybe\u2026As long as \u2018we are singing again,\u2019 everything will be alright.\n\u2018Numbness\u2019 is ascertainably Pink\nFloyd-esque, a melancholic song\ndrenched with pain. It seems to be a\nresentful reflection on love. The words\nreverberate, almost slurred and sputtered out, the hoarseness of the intonation plus the slow thudding beats and\nthe brooding crashing chords build\nthroughout the course of the six min-utes, amplifying the ominous mood\nthat hangs over the whole track. You\nneed some serious endorphins to lift\nthis depression and drown the crushing sorrows before this numbness is\n\u2018really, really let loose.\u2019\nIn \u2018I See Houses\u2019, the melody meanders somewhat strangely. It is hard to\nfollow at first, and the combination of\nweird piano chords creates a kind of\ndiscord.\nOnly when the chorus kicks in, do we\nactually have a relatively fine tune that\nis easier to recognise and sing along\nto. The beginning of \u2018Noise Epic\u2019 has\na very experimental feel to it, as if the\nband were testing the sounds, unsure\nof whether to proceed or not. The verse\nconsists of talking rather than singing,\nsomething that we weren\u2019t expecting. I\ndon\u2019t know what to make of this track-a confused number that got slipped in,\nnot on par with the core songs but so\nwhat? As they say, nothing can be per-fect, flaws are what makes things interesting and unique.\nUltimately, The Verve are still in this\ngame from the sound of things. \u2018Forth\u2019\nis full of weirdly ethereal soundscapes,\nan odyssey that allows you to taste\nenlightenment, pain, loneliness, fear\nand desolation. Through the moody\nlandscapes, painted with emotion and\nhope, may a fifth one be on its way in\nthe future.\nAlexTurnerandMilesKane,theformer\nbeing better known as the Arctic Monkeys front man and the latter less well\nknown as the Rascals front man.\nFor those who don\u2019t know, these two\ngot together with producer James Ford\nalmost a year ago and formed \u2018The Last\nShadow Puppets\u2019. The band released\ntheir 1st album \u2018The Age of the Understatement\u2019 in April.\nThe set was littered with classic covers such as David Bowie\u2019s \u2018In the Heart\nof the Morning\u2019, The Beatles\u2019 \u2018I want\nyou\u2019 and Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u2018Memories\u2019,\namong others. These were carefully\ninterwoven with the Puppets own (fast\nAni DiFranco, Grammy winning sing-er-songwriter, has been in the limelight for a long time now, and it is crazy\nto think that she debuted nearly two\ndecades ago. And here, we have her\n17th studio album that was concocted\nthrough the course of two years. Incredible. How this woman churns out\nsuch a prolific amount of material is\nbeyond all of us. But she does it with\nease, passion and creativity. Since 1990,\nshe has been releasing at least one disc\nof her bountiful brilliance each year. A\nrare, gifted talent she is. High five.\nDiFranco breaks away with \u2018Red Letter Year,\u2019 an atmospheric title track. It\ninitiates with acoustic guitar accents,\nlazy string and percussion instrumen-tation, that caves in immediately to the\nbrooding brass sustained notes with interjections of reverb and delay that can\nbe heard explicitly. Interestingly, the\ninterlude seems to have DiFranco singing through a funnel, her voice echoes\nsomewhat, calling from the mountain\ntops. Like her numerous signature\nsongs, this one is equally political in\ncontent-\u2018thewholeworldismadeofone\nunbroken line,\u2019 yet \u2018in a town,\u2019 someone\n\u2018might put a gun to you throat or rip\nthe roof right off your place.\u2019 Ostensibly, the imagery conveyed is one that\nemphasises the artist\u2019s cynical view of\nsociety. \u2018Goddess sent word that this\nwould be a red letter year, they didn\u2019t\nmention how much shit was gonna\nchange around here.\u2019 Here, DiFranco is\npossibly referring to what happened in\nAmerica, the natural disasters such as\nHurricane Katrina that wiped out New\nOrleans and brought devastation to so\nmany.\nTo follow, \u2018Alla This\u2019 is an amalgamation of hybrid sounds that is driven\nby a strong undercurrent of thudding\ndrum clatter and distinct sonic ele-ments. Her firm feministic stance is\nexpounded through the lines-\u2018I won\u2019t\npray to a male god, coz that would be\ninsane.\u2019 Good for her. In contrast, the\nambience shifts to a calmer one in\n\u2018Present/Infant\u2019. The verses yield to a\nchorus that allows DiFranco to pour\nout her worries and insecurities- lately\nshe\u2019s \u2018been glaring into mirrors picking\u2019 herself \u2018apart,\u2019 fearing that her \u2018life\nwill be over,\u2019. Despite everything-\u2018here\u2019s\nthis tiny baby\u2019 who looks like her \u2018and\nshe is smiling\u2019 \u2018with that present infant\nglee.\u2019 Being a mother, DiFranco cannot\nbut express the deep maternal love that\nshe feels for her daughter and so she\nchants, \u2018love is all over the place.\u2019\nSimilarly, \u2018Smiling Underneath\u2019 alludes to the joy, reassurance and security of being in the presence of that\nspecial someone. The indifference that\none feels to the dreariness of the world\nbecause, \u2018as long as I\u2019m with you, I\u2019m\nhaving a good time.\u2019 DiFranco will be\ngrinning like a Cheshire cat all day\nlong, willing to endure the universe\u2019s\nannoyances, she doesn\u2019t even \u2018mind\nwaiting in line\u2019 or being \u2018stuck in traffic for a week.\u2019 The track begins with a\nsomewhat ballady feel which changes\nas the drum and bass kicks in and the\nlayers of synthesised sounds accumu-late. This number shows that she\u2019s human too, with a sentimental facet hidden behind the strong woman image.\n\u2018Emancipated Minor\u2019 has a groovy\ncurrent to it, almost disco-like beats\ncan be heard, reminiscent of Jamie\nLidell\u2019s snazzy album \u2018JIM\u2019. The tempo\nis very upbeat, carried by the lilting\nAlbum Review\nAni DiFranco\nRed Letter Year\nHHHHI\nSusan Yu\nstride which has you on your feet, hips\nswinging, hands clapping, the whole\nlot. A catchy guitar riff plays through-out, as trancelike and effective as The\nBee Gees\u2019 \u2018Staying Alive.\u2019\nWithin the cute track \u2018Good Luck,\u2019\nyou hear a rather varied instrumenta-tion; there being the syncopated drum,\nlong sustained string notes, distant\nguitar refrains, and low key electronic\npiano swooning.\nNext, we have \u2018The Atom,\u2019 in which\nthere is a lovely guitar refrain that lazily strolls along with the sublime lulling\nof DiFranco\u2019s singing. This is followed\nby a small quiet drum roll, warm and\nwistful the soundscape flows, like the\ncontinuous incoming tide that washes\nacross the shore, to and fro it emerges\nsleepily.\nDiFranco\u2019s bright voice sails high\n\u2018Round a Pole.\u2019 We hear something that\nresembles the soulfulness of Norah\nJones\u2019 delightful vocals. A sensual sluggish exuberance meets the touch of\njazz that swims within this piece, ending on an abrupt cluster of distorted\nelectronic sounds. Tantalisingly exper-imental. When we consider \u2018Star Matter,\u2019 the starry sky is indeed dreamlike,\nconcocted out of lethargy that oozes\nfrom all corners. The sax billows inter-mittently, softening the mood, rendering the piece overwhelmingly mellow.\nOverall, this is a funky album that\nhas been piced up with many different\ninfluences, from country, folk, soul to\njazz, it\u2019s all gelled together seductively.\nThis is a refreshing departure from\nthe regular indie-rock/cheesy pop that\nis being meticulously manufactured\nand packaged by many record labels.\nWanting a change of scene?- This one\nis certainly worthy of your attention.\nDiFranco has had her way for the last\ntwo decades and continues to do so.\nAni crouches by the wall, eagerly anticipating that red letter of hers\n17th album later and she\u2019s still smiling, what a high-spirited lady Ani Difranco is...wish we all had her smile\nbecoming) classics and all accompanied by strings, wind and percussion.\nThe enthusiastic crowd got involved\nfrom the first word and the Puppets\nresponded fiercely, maintaining the\nfriendlybanterthroughouttheevening.\nIt is currently rare to see a band who\nsounds better live than on their record-ing, but the Last Shadow Puppets do it\nto perfection.\nSadly, they are warming up for their\nlast UK performance (before Turner\nreturns to the Monkeys) as I write this\narticle, so it may be a little while before another opportunity arises to see\nthem.\nThat said, I am sure they will return,\nand when they do, GO SEE THEM\nFOR YOURSELF!\nSam Lombard The Last Shadow Puppets merge into the dark, dark backdrop...trapped in a blackhole of no return\nNo shying away from the\nlimelight by the l. s. puppets\nThe Last Shadow Puppets\nLive at Hammersmith Apollo\nHHHHI\n\n"

I\nwas just about to put the truth down\non the scrapling when other freshers\ncame up and agreed with him, which\nthrew me off guard because I thought\nthat Imperial had entry standards. Oh\nwell. Essentially their argument went\nlike this:\n\u201cYour year [final year] is screwed by\nthis economic crisis because there are\nno jobs. But by the time my year gradu-ates, things will be fine and I\u2019ll get a job\nwithout any problems.\u201d\nSome of you (especially freshers)\nmight read this and wonder what\u2019s\nwrong with the statement. If that\u2019s the\ncase, let\u2019s do some freakonomics you\nand I.\nFirst of all you\u2019re going to need to understand what a \u201cglut\u201d is. A glut is when\nthere is too much of a product for sale\nin a market, leaving extra product left\nover after the buyers have had their fill.\nIn this case the product is graduates\nand the buyers are the financial insti-tutions. Because the bankers are taking\nfewer graduates, there are going to be\nbanker wannabes drifting around the\njobs market, like floating turds waiting\nto be flushed.\nEconomists amongst you will point\nout that a glut is solved by price cuts.\nYou\u2019ll point out that the product will\nbecome cheaper and eventually the\nmarket will correct itself. You are\nwrong. Salary plays a minor role in the\ncost of turning a graduate man-cub\ninto a real fully fledged people-thing,\nthere\u2019s the training, the recruitment,\nfinding busy work for them, mentoring\nthem, feeding them, clothing them,\ntucking them in at night. Cutting the\nsalary wont compensate for those other costs. Graduates are hard, expensive\nwork, and right now the banks have\nother things to do. Plus, if the investment houses drop their salary offers,\nprime graduates will just look elsewhere for employment.\nAt this point, the fresher will say:\n\u201cExactly! Surely the banker wannabes\nwill just go work some at some other\nplace?\u201d and in a way, he\u2019s right. Thousands of potential city folk will end up\nworking in jobs completely different\nfrom banking; instead of becoming\ntraders they will go work as civil serv-ants, buyers, upstream controllers, retailers or something.\n\u201cHa\u201d says the fresher \u201cSee, I\u2019m right.\nAll this years leavers will end up doing\nsomething else, and when I graduate all\nthose juicy banking jobs will be mine.\u201d\nWrong.\nA university graduate can apply for a\nHow many people do you know? And\nI\u2019m not talking about the number of\nfriends on facebook, how many people do you know? How many people\ndo you care about? How many people\ncould ask you for a favour? How many\npeople could you just stop and chat\nwith? How many peoples wellbeing are\nyou concerned about? Think about it\nfor a moment. Got a number? Good.\nWrite it down.\nNow for a tangent:\nMonkeys and apes live in social\ngroups (for the most part), and different species have differently sized com-munities. Monkeys and apes also have\nneocortexes and if you chop up enough\nmonkey brains and look at enough\nmonkeys in the wild, you find that the\nsize of the social group is a direct function of neocortex size. A Liverpudlian\ncalled Robin Ian MacDonald Dunbar\ncame to realise all this and being then\ndecided to take a look at the human\nneocortex. He then worked out that\nthe average \u201cnumber of individuals\nwith whom a stable inter-personal relationship can be maintained\u201d is about\n150. This is Dunbars number.\nNow look at your number. How close\nwere you? Does the whole thing make\nsense? If not, think about how many\npeople are on your course. Now think\nabout how cohesive it is. Still not con-vinced? Try and think of a group of\nmore than 150 people and think about\nhow well it stays together. When Dunbar looked at 21 hunter gather villages\nhe found that the average population\nsize was 148.4. When psychologist\nDennis Fox studied the tragedy of the\ncommons he concluded that \u201cthe upper limit for a simple, self-contained,\nsustaining, well-functioning commons may be as low as 150 people\u201d.\nThe Roman army considered 150 to be\nthe maximum size of a fighting unit.\nWilbert Gore, (inventor of Gore-Tex)\nadamantly stated that a company plant\nshould never have more than 150 people working there because \u201cWe found\nagain and again that things get clumsy\nat a hundred and fifty\u201d.\n150 is the magic number.\n\u201cBut\u201d you interject, \u201cwhat the hell\ndoes any of this matter?\u201d It matters because we live in and function in groups\nWhy a free market\nsociety will never\nwork.\nAnd neither will a communist one.\nof much larger than 150 and the only\nway that we can do that is by creating\nrules and laws. 150 people can live in\nharmonious, libertarian or socialist,\nanarchy, any more than that and you\nneed structure.\nThe society we live in is a patchwork\nquilt of interconnected groups of 150.\nTo make the whole shebang work we\nneed governance, and rights and the\nlike keeping a sense of uniformity,\nto make sure we treat others like we\nwant to be treated. So we set up laws\nand rules as if we all lived in a Dunbar Group (150 people) and then apply them to everyone, so that we act to\nstrangers as if they\u2019re people we empa-thise with.\nThe problem is, it doesn\u2019t work. Dunbar\u2019s number is why we don\u2019t feel bad\nstealing from corporations but why we\ndon\u2019t steal from our friends. It\u2019s why\npeople spend more on pets than chari-ties. It\u2019s why we find it hard to worry\nabout \u201cthe planet\u201d or \u201cthe rainforest\u201d\nin the same way we worry about our\nparents. Simply pretending that people\ncan act towards strangers in the same\nway that they act towards their Dunbar\nGroup is crazy.\nWhen we construct an economic sys-tem, it doesn\u2019t make biological sense.\nHumans aren\u2019t naturally communist\nor capitalist; we\u2019re all anarchists at\nheart. If you take a group of 150 people\nand let them form their own nation, it\nlooks nothing like the sort of world we\nlive in. There aren\u2019t any formal titles.\nProperty balances neatly with sharing.\nHierarchies form based on personality\nand competence. Crime is dealt with\nby the people. Money usually becomes\ntotally irrelevant. When humans exist\nin a natural state, life is much simpler.\nEvery economic principle is manu-factured. None are \u201cright\u201d \u2013 they\u2019re\njust tools to try and make our \u201csupersocieties\u201d more like the mini ones we\u2019re\nsupposed to live in. The free market\nworld cannot exist. Communist states\ndon\u2019t work. What we always end up using is some kind of mixture of ideals.\nThe combination of free markets and\ngovernment control is the only way to\nsimulate the social groups that we used\nto live in, and so it will thrive. We need\nto balance freedom and order.\nSo the next time someone tries to\nsell you some economic ideology, take\nit with a cup of salt.\nLiving free, smiling wide.\ngraduate job so long as they have three\nor fewer years of work experience.\nThat means all the graduates from my\nyear will go out and get whatever they\ncan find for now, then reapply for the\nmilk round (the annual graduate recruitment jamboree) next year. When\nthey reapply, they\u2019ll have three major\nadvantages over next years graduates\nA degree in hand. None of this conditional offer rubbish, my year will apply for jobs next year with definite re-sults. For the employer that means no\nrisk and no waiting.\nExperience. My year group will have\nbeen working, paying taxes, sucking up\nto bosses and generally growing more\nmature in the gap between recruitment cycles. This makes them much\nmore attractive to the banks than fresh\nfaced grads.\nThe hunger. The wannabe bankers\nwill spend a year working some crappy\ntemporary job, yearning day in, day out\nfor the sweet, sweet financial fiscal.\nWhen they get another chance, they\u2019re\ngoing to fight harder for those jobs\nthan next years grads will believe.\n\u201cSo what?\u201d says the fresher \u201cthat\u2019s a\nproblem for next years graduates. By\nthe time I get out of uni everything will\nbe back to normal\u201d\nWrong again.\nThis effect is going to snowball. The\nsurplus from my year will hang around\nfor three years before they stop applying to prime graduate jobs. The surplus from next years graduates will\nstill be applying for those spots in four\nyears time and so on. There is a very\nfinite number of decent graduate jobs\nout there and for the next half a decade\nthere are going to be a hell of a lot of\noverqualified graduates. Considering\nthat this recession will last another 18\nmonths or so, by the time the freshers\ngraduate things are going to be stupidly tough.\nIf you look up the last major recession (the 80\u2019s) you\u2019ll find a joke about\ngraduate employment:\nQ. What do you say to a graduate\nwith a job?\nA. Big Mac and fries please.\nGet used to hearing it, it\u2019s going to\nmake a comeback.\nWe\u2019re gonna get to know how that feels.\nYeah you wish!\nLuke Dhanoa\nBusiness Editor\n\n"

Both men are worthy\ncandidates and are of unimpeachable\nintegrity. And while most polls put\nObama ahead, the gap varies from a\ndone deal to a photo finish. In short,\nthe election could still go either way.\nWe have aimed to present for you the\narguments for an Obama Presidency\nand a McCain Presidency; as well as\na round-up of the policies they are\nputting forward. We have left our political baggage at the door and written\nfor each candidate as if we were their\nmost ardent supporters.\nThere are a few Imperial students\nwho will have the opportunity to vote\nfrom abroad but the vast majority of us\nhave no say in Tuesday\u2019s election. This\ndoes not mean that you shouldn\u2019t make\na choice: this election is as important\nto the rest of the world as it is to the\npeople of America.\nThe decisions the next President of\nthe United States makes domestically\nwill have a deep and lasting impact on\nthe rest of the world.\nFor that reason we included a certain\namount of focus on the domestic issues\nas well as the message the election\u2019s\nresult will send out to the world.\nWe don\u2019t know about you, but we\nwill be staying up late on Tuesday,\nwaiting for America to decide.\nKadhim Shubber\nAfonso Campos\nGilead Amit\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10 felix Friday 31 October 2008\nPolitics\nPolitics Editor \u2013 James Goldsack & Katya-yani Vyas\nT\nhere is a lot to fit into one\npage of Politics this week.\nYet again the US elections\nare taking up a significant\npart of felix.\nWhile we are on the subject, Barack\nObama is not only a terrorist but a\nNazi; according to a letter signed by\ntop McCain officials.\n\u201cJewish Americans cannot afford to\nmake the wrong decision on Tuesday,\nNovember 4th, 2008. Many of our ancestors ignored the warning signs in\nthe 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s and made a tragic\nmistake. Let\u2019s not make a similar one\nthis year!\u201d\nOne more reason to hate McCain and\nhis campaign. You are going to lose,\nwhich will be better than you passing\naway and your running mate becomig\nPresident. Did you actually think that\nmay in any way be a good idea? Thank\nGod for small mercies. Jerk\nSo, that is all from the theocracy\nover the pond, there are issues closer\nto home. It appears that both main\nparties have links with one billionaire\nnamed Oleg - George Osborne trying\nto obtain funding and Peter Mandelson supposedly \u201cholidaying\u201d.\nThe fear is that some foreigner will\nget involved in politics where he really\ndoesn\u2019t belong. Who knows what will\nhappen if we allow this sort of behav-iour, more is at stake than simply party\nfunding.\nAnd the financial crisis...\nWhy are we not joining the Euro?\nSince the inception of the currency,\nmany top politicians (and recently\nmostly Liberal Democrats) have been\nwaiting for the \u201copportune moment\u201d to\njoin. Now is the time as the Eurozone\nis the biggest economy, surpassing the\nUS Dollar. Oh, and the pound is falling faster than the disastrous USD. Not\na good sign. Baghdad is beginning to\nspeak out again over the use of Iraq by\nthe USA as a military base from where\nto attack its neighbours. Finally, those\ngreedy yanks may be kicked out oil-less before they completely rape the\ncountry.\nThe real test will be whether the\nIraqis put their money where their\nmouths are and act. Goooo Iraqis!\nWell, this is the last issue of Felix\nbefore the US elections. Next week\nwe will be telling you how Obama\nwon in a landslide victory against the\narchaeological artefact and an ignorant failure. Hopefully. McCain is still\nclaiming that the race is close \u2013 crazy\nidea; remember kids, torture screws\nyou up reeaaaal bad. Worse than crack.\nAs America\u2019s power declines almost as\nfast as its economy, perhaps these elections are not so important any more.\nA president of a Federal Europe would\nhave so much more power. And we\nwould be a part of it. Nice.\nI must end by pleading with you. If\nyou are American, please vote Obama.\nWe would owe you more than Africa\nowes the G8. By this time next week\nwe can get back to being content with\nUK and world politics without it being\ndominated by the US elections.\nFinally.\nWhy I am not voting on the 4th\nEdward Townes reflects on the presidential elections and provides analysis on the upcoming elections\nAs an American citizen I have the ability to contribute somewhere on the order of a millionth of a percent to the\ndecision of who becomes the most\npowerful person in the world for the\nnext four years. Not long ago I would\nhave been honoured and proud of this\nprivilege, but I have since observed an\nelection process that has both shocked\nand deeply disappointed me.\nWe have a very pervasive myth in\nAmerica that we are a free and just\ncountry, protected under the Constitution and with a government subservient to the people through the democratic process. We are led to believe\nthat our presidential elections are the\nmost refined and functional displays\nof democracy in the world today.\nWe are led to believe that our right\nto choose between two candidates, a\nconsequence of generations of ancestors fighting for our freedom, should\nnot only be celebrated, but that anyone\nwho chooses not to exercise that right\nis virtually criminal.\nEvery four years we are presented\nwith a line of candidates for the nomination of the only two political parties\nthat matter, Democrats and Republicans. Hardly anyone has heard of\nmore than one or two of these people before, and thus the mainstream\nmedia is free to declare who are the\nfront-runners. Immediately after, the\nmainstream media begins publishing\nmanipulated polls to reinforce their\nviews and take advantage of the horserace mentality of American voting. We\nare then graced with fascinating televised debates, where the answers are\nlimited to 30-second sound bites and\nthe questions are thoroughly dumbed\ndown and vetted beforehand. In these\ndebates we get to hear such diverse\nopinions as: whether to change the income tax rate by 2%, or 3%; or whether\nto move 5000 troops from Iraq to Afghanistan, or 6000. Occasionally we\nget a really wild candidate who wants to\nmove troops from Afghanistan to Iraq\ninstead! With such diversity of opin-ion, it is often very difficult to choose\nbetween the candidates. Thankfully\nthe mainstream media is here to help\nus, as they will frequently and kindly\npoint out that some of the candidates\nwith unusual views have no chance of\nwinning and are clinically insane.\nThe reality is that the American\npresidential elections are a tightly controlled charade, designed to keep the\nsame institutions in power every time,\nwhilst soothing the American people\nwith illusions of their ability to choose\ntheir government. If you are not either\na Republican or a Democrat, you have\nno chance of winning at all, since ballot\naccess is strictly controlled and intentionally made extremely resource consuming for any third party. Furthermore, no mainstream media company\nis willing to provide a forum for debate\ninvolving third parties, or even barely\nmention them in the news. Thus the\nAmerican public is kept in the dark\nabout any alternative existing outside\nof the two major parties. Within the\nDemocratic and Republican parties\nthere is the occasional bad apple who\nwants to ruin the fun and actually talk\nabout real issues, but there are a myriad of techniques employed to ostra-cize, insult and suppress anyone who\ndoes not toe the line.\nThe reason that third parties are\nsuppressed is very simple: efficiency.\nIf you look at the major donors for\nany major candidate, you will notice a\nstartling number of similarities. The\ngame is that the special interests in\nAmerica buy the loyalty of politicians\nby bankrolling the campaigns of the\ntwo political parties, exploiting loopholes in campaign finance laws in what\namounts to bribery, and guaranteeing\ntheir future careers after political of-fice. In this way the special interests\ncan ensure their goals are met no matter who wins. It is clearly cheapest for\nthe special interests when the number\nof choices available to the American\npublic is as small as possible without\ncompromising the appearance of de-mocracy. And to cap it all off, there\nis now significant evidence of routine\nvote fraud.\nNobody who is allowed by the media to be publicly visible talks about\nanything important, especially during\nelections. No one ever asks why we\nhave 700 military bases, in 130 foreign\ncountries, at the expense of over $1\ntrillion per year. No one ever asks why\nwe have a monstrously complex system\nof income taxation, one of the most repugnant insults to liberty imaginable.\nNo one ever asks why it is the government\u2019s business to manage energy pro-duction, why our healthcare system is\nso horribly deficient, why our schools\nare virtually third world in quality, why\nwe have a banking system that is so\nfraudulent that it is arguably the biggest scam in human history, why our\ncivil liberties have progressively disappeared over the last century, why our\ncountry is constantly going to war for\nthe benefit of military contractors and\ncorrupt corporations seeking to exploit\nother countries, why we bully other\ngovernments into corruption and indebtedness with the World Bank on\npain of assassination or invasion, why\nnearly all Federal government spending is in violation of the 10th Amendment, and the list goes on and on.\nAmerica is but a mere shadow of\nwhat it once was. It started as a constitutional republic, a beacon of liberty\nfor the world. It enjoyed the greatest\neconomic growth in the history of the\nworld for decades, the highest savings\nrate ever (not a coincidence), and the\ngreatest increase in prosperity for the\nlittle guy. It had principles of freedom\nand limited government enshrined\nin its Constitution, a true charter for\nthe future of free people. It failed. It\nnow has a monetary system based on\ndebt slavery and a savings rate 20 times\nlower than China, its Constitution is\nso ignored that it is not even worth\nthe paper it was written upon, it has a\ngovernment that resembles a form of\ncorporate fascism, it has a middle and\nlower class that has gotten progressively poorer in real terms for decades,\nand, pathetically, it still believes it is\nthe country it once was.\nSo, in conclusion, the reason I\u2019m not\nvoting is that it won\u2019t make a damn\nbit of difference. Neither McCain\nnor Obama will make any significant\nchange in America\u2019s policies or address any of the important fundamental problems of our country, no matter\nhow well-intentioned they might be.\nFrom my perspective the choice between Obama and McCain is fraudulently presented as a real contrast of\npolicies, when in actual fact both of\nthese men are products of the system\nand guarantee a continuation of the\ngeneral tragic trends in America. My\nreal choice is whether or not to entertain this sickening circus of thieves,\nparasites and ignorance with my vote\nat all. If I do not, then I undercut their\nclaim of representing the American\npeople and join the some 70% of us\nwho do the same. In fact, I sort of am\nvoting, I\u2019m voting for the illegitimacy\nof the US Government.\nJames Goldsack\nPolitics Editor\nTo vote, or not to vote, that is the question... how many of America\u2019s citizens simply do not care about the outcome of the elections?\n\n"

In this this situation, I recommend talcum powder and turning the\nlights down.\nSome suggestions (girls only because\nboys end up looking a bit camp):\nPirate ship\u2019s wench:\nWhite shirt revealing sexy bra un-derneath, lots of gold jewellery (pref-erably, bought for you by a rich man),\na short skirt or shorts, something tied\naround your head (which will not mess\nyour hair up too much once you take\nit all in the bedroom and be careful\nto tie it baggy around the top of your\nhead otherwise you will look bald) and\nof course, thigh high boots- every girl\nshould own a pair.\nDevil:\nHorns and red underwear.\nPlayboy bunny:\nPlayboy ears and black underwear\nCatwoman:\nCat mask and black underwear. (This\nis especially good when you\u2019re having a\nbad day and want to hide your face.)\nMaid:\nWhite apron, underwear and feather\nflicker (to come in handy later on in\nthe night)\nMinnie Mouse:\nMouse ears and spotty underwear\nIt is a given that all these outfits must\nbe accompanied by high stiletto heels\nwith stockings and suspenders (fish-nets at a push).\nNote, Marks and Spencers basic\nwhites are NOT suitable underwear\nTamara says: Nine out of ten people enjoy gang rape.\nI hate smilie people.\nGot a problem? contact Tamara\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nsudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk Fun & Games\nThe winner of Slitherlink 1,412 was\nYu-Xi Chau ! Congratulations on winning another puzzle. Your on fire inn\nmetaphoric sense. Please keep enter-ing. We\u2019ll give a prize out in the sum-mer. It\u2019ll be good.\nHow to play:\nCrudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar\nto Minesweeper mixed with a dash of\nSudoku.\nThe object of the game is to draw\nlines between the dots to create one\nlong, and most importantly, looping\nline. It should have no start or finish;\njust like an elastic band.\nEach number indicates how many\nlines should be drawn around it, for\nexample:\nCells which don\u2019t contain a number\ncan be surrounded by any number of\nlines.\nRemember, the line must form a\nloop, so the line cannot branch. The\nfollowing situations are not allowed:\nSquares are not allowed either. There\nare never cells containing the number\n4 in Slitherlink.\nSo, where do you start? The most\ncommon place to start on a Slitherlink\ngrid is by drawing crosses around any\nzeros. Drawing crosses is purely done\nto so that you know where there can\u2019t\npossibly be a line. So, take the pattern\nbelow as an example. Begin by drawing\ncrosses, then by filling in some lines:\nNow the lines can only continue in the\nfollowing directions:\nSlitherlink 1,413\n3\n2 2\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\n1,412 solution\n3\n0\nx\nx\nx\nx\nTEXT US!

The quality of rowing\ndemanded and improvements in training are continually pushing athletes to\nthe national standard. It is therefore no\ncoincidence that this year\u2019s rowing GB\ntrials were run in conjunction with the\nBritish Universities & Colleges Sport\n(BUCS) Small Boats Head (SBH) held\nat Boston Rowing Club, Lincolnshire.\nICBC had entries for both GB trials\nand SBH, coming away with two top\nten trial finishes and medalling in all\nthree SBH divisions.\nTeam ICBC left London early last\nSaturday morning to undergo a 2km\nergo (indoor rowing machine) test at\nthe Princess Royal Sports Arena. Successful meeting of the expected GB\nergo standards meant progression into\nthe single sculls 5km trial on Sunday.\nICBC\u2019s Ole Tietz (U23 Lwt) made\napple strudel of his competitors by\nsmashing his PB and making the GB\nnational standard with over 23 seconds\nto spare. A tidy profit was made selling\nseconds to less conditioned athletes\nunable to make the standard. ICBC\ntriallists performed well with E.R. Go\n(Concept RC) coming away the overall\nwinner on the day.\nAfter a gruelling day at trials there\nwere no casualties. Except for Adam\nSeward. A \u2018back injury\u2019 manifested\nin the minibus on the journey from\nLondon. Understandably, Adam was\nconfused as to the correct way to sit\nin a moving vehicle. Stabbing pains\nwere reported when coming within\nearshot of an ergo flywheel. A medical note was somehow produced. We\nhope his recovery will be as speedy as\nhis injury.\nBack at the \u2018Comfort\u2019 Inn, Team\nICBC were presented with a potato\nlasagna. This didn\u2019t go down too well,\nfor reasons I have yet to understand.\nUnimpressed with the food, Coach\nStuart Whitelaw miraculously hit upon\nall the ingredients necessary for that\nSanta-red glow and will be making an\nappearance at this year\u2019s ICBC Christmas Party.\nOn Sunday morning, ICBC had 6 entries in the heavyweight (M1x) and 5\nin the lightweight (LM1x) men\u2019s single\nsculls trialling for GB squads. Leander\u2019s\nIan Lawson secured first place in the\nM1x with a finish time of 18:09.68 and\nwas one of 4 Leander entries to make\nthe top 10 of 84. ICBC aim to be in\nthis position in the near future. ICBC\u2019s\nSimon Hislop came 10th overall in\n19:00.84 while Dan Cadoux-Hudson\nalso had a strong performance coming\n24th overall (11th in U23).\nIn the LM1x, ICBC\u2019s Adam Freeman-Pask, in a gesture befitting a\nman of good breeding came second\n(18:43.31), allowing Stephen Feeney\nof London RC (18:41.35) to have his\nCristina Duffy\nSo, do you row that boat or just carry it?\nglory for the day. Big Andy (Andrew\nGordon) also impressed coming 29th\noverall (18th in U23).\nIn the BUCS Small Boats Head there\nwas further success for ICBC crews\nwho won medals in all three divisions.\nPasklop was in action again, this time\nunder the guise of a coxless pair and\na bronze medal was collected: the slip\nto third place reportedly due to mid-race arguing about an email concerning a lunch date. When separated and\ngiven their own boats, the pair were\nindividually more successful and both\nclaimed silver medals: Hislop in the\nM1x and Freeman-Pask in the LM1x\nraces. In the Men\u2019s championship\ndouble sculls Henry Goodier and Dan\nCadoux-Hudson were witnessed cutting some shapes down the river and\ncame home in third place. Alex Gillies\nand Andy Gordon tore up the field in\ntheir Lwt2x. Wheels smoking like true\nlightweights, they finished 4th in a hotly contested event.\nThus ends another successful weekend of racing for ICBC ahead of the\nmajor Fuller Four\u2019s Head of the River\nRace which takes place next Saturday\nNovember 8th. ICBC are holding their\nannual club dinner the same night at\nthe Knighstbridge Hotel to celebrate\nwith many special guests.

Geek\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of felix\nU\nnless you have really\nbeen dedicating your\nlife to Imperial College\nand haven\u2019t had a chance\nto look at a newspaper,\nyou\u2019ll be aware that the US elections\nare just around the corner.\nWith the backing of political heavyweights such as Teddy Kennedy and\nthe former Secretary of State Colin\nPowell, Barack Obama is able to take\ntime off the campaign trail to visit his\nsick grandmother\u2026 which may show\nhim to be a caring family man, but\nthat\u2019s just a coincidence.\nOther than his unorthodox heritage and the fact that for the first time\nin almost 20 years the US presidency\nis out of the hands of either the Bush\nor Clinton Dynasties, what is different\nabout Obama? According to his web-site, he \u2018was raised by a single mother\nand his grandparents. They didn\u2019t have\nmuch money, but they taught him values from the Kansas heartland where\nthey grew up. He took out loans to put\nhimself through school.\u2019\nThat, coupled with his smooth and\neloquent mastery of the English language as well as his relatively young\nage and his short time in Capitol Hill,\nmakes me believe that he has not spent\nlong enough time around politicians to\nbecome corrupt and saturated with the\nsleaze that is associated with Politics.\nSadly, I have developed a condition\nwhere by I have the cynicism of a man\nmany years my senior and so I began\nto ask the question: if it is that easy to\nbring change, why have the majority of\nprevious world leaders been so corrupt\nand why, no matter how far you look\nback, the same issues trouble the same\npeople? The poor get poorer and the\nrich get richer.\nThe answer lies in the electoral proc-ess. Imagine a medical profession\nwhere there is still the same number of\ndoctors but there can only be one consultant per country at any one time. Or\nwhere there is still the same number of\naccountants but only one can be chartered at any one time! That is the world\nof politics, there is only one job as head\nof state and every MP in the UK or\nSenator in the US is gunning for it.\nI don\u2019t believe that Richard Nixon,\nRonald Reagan or even George \u2018Dubya\u2019\nBush were evil people intent on bringing war to the world. However, they\nwere ambitious and driven to succeed,\nwilling to do anything to be the best\nin their career and therefore become\npresident. This puts the candidate in\na position whereby they must sacrifice\ncertain morals or ethics for \u2018the greater\ngood\u2019.\nThough their foreign policies may\ndiffer, every presidential candidate on\nthe run up to elections suddenly becomes Jewish and wears a kippah or\nyarmulke in order to secure the Jewish vote. They promise to increase the\nmilitary budget and to be tough on\nimmigration and terrorism, as well as\nmagically improving the financial situation for \u2018Joe the Plumber\u2019.\nThese are all things the Barack\nObama is \u2018guilty\u2019 of. The question is\nthis: is he just playing the game by its\nrules in order to win or is this JFK of\nour time being molded into the very\nthing he is aiming to go against \u2013 \u2018the\nstatus quo\u2019.\nLet us hope that Mr. Obama is the\nman that will finally have the strength\nof character to change politics and not\nlet politics change him.\nElections 2008: Time for change\nGilead Amit\nI\n\u2019m beginning to tire of the Silver Surfer generation. Partly\nbecause they\u2019re not dying off\nanyway near as fast as statistics\nsay they should, and partly because they\u2019re driving my technological\nlife into a mire of touchscreens, \u2018natural interfaces\u2019 and pure molten fecal\nmatter. There was a time when to run a\npiece of software you\u2019d actually need to\nwrite code yourself; applications that\nwere supplied with the sort of manuals\nthat make the Bible look like a pocket\nnovel. An era when technology was indistinguishable from magic and people\nstill had to look things up in encyclopedias with only a few authors. What\u2019s\nwrong with it now? Lucy. Lucy is what\u2019s\nwrong with it now.\nI\u2019ve named her Lucy because that\u2019s\nthe name of the puppy my family has\nrecently taken on, and they both share\nthecharacteristicsofbeingstupid,short\nand amusing to watch when struggling\nwith something new. The human Lucy\nwas standing next to me on the Tube\nand my attention was drawn to her\nwhen she started making a noise I can\nonly describe as somewhere between a\nmachine gun and a bluegrass percussion track. I look over and she\u2019s flailing around with a Blackberry phone,\ntrying to scroll through four hundred\nemails of fetid garbage. The great thing\nwith the Blackberry is that it can store\napproximately three bazillion emails\nbut is completely incapable of showing more than four onscreen at once,\neven in abbreviated form. So she stood\nthere, scratching her way up using a\ntiny, absurd scroll wheel to scurry up\nthe infinite list of babble.\nWhy is Lucy the problem? Lucy is\nthe one who asked for the scroll wheel\nin the first place, you see. She\u2019s the\nperson who thinks that surfing the\nnet on the iPod Touch is a good idea.\nLucy wants Facebook on the move and\nshe plays the Wii because it\u2019s \u2018just like\nplaying real tennis\u2019. Lucy is the modern\ntechnological consumer and, despite\nbeing all about the Geeks, Imperial has\nplenty of you folk in its ranks. You\u2019re\nthe new, fashionable majority, with disposable income up the wazoo in spite\nof the credit crunch and a desire for all\nthings over designed. And you\u2019re ruining all my fun.\nThe reason I\u2019ve come to this conclusion is that I\u2019ve been fiddling a bit with\nLinux lately, in an attempt to really get\nto know some of its more obtuse fea-tures. I\u2019ve tinkered on the command\nline, I\u2019ve started to use console-based\nIRC clients. Hell, I even used ViM a bit,\nand you normally have to get a doctor\nto sign saying you\u2019re a lost cause before\nyou install that. It\u2019s definitely an unwieldy beast, beating you with a stick\nmade of pure error message every time\nyou look at it a bit funny, or use too\nmany vowels when spelling. But the\nfact is that it\u2019s fast. And it makes you\nfast as a result. Text editing with ViM\nis just wondrous and when you\u2019re using simple, clever software on Linux\nit just glides - like computers are supposed to.\nThere\u2019s learning involved, of course.\nIt\u2019s non-intuitive. It doesn\u2019t even try to\nmake sense most of the time and the\nrare occasions that it does something\nadhering to logic it normally requires a\nMasters degree or a misspent youth to\nunderstand what it\u2019s trying to tell you.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a better\noption, which it undoubtedly is. So\nwhy aren\u2019t we all tapping away at eighty\nwords per minute, leafing through syntax lists and understanding the Ext2FS\nfile system? Because Lucy doesn\u2019t want\nto. Because the technology industry\nis telling itself that what Lucy really\nwants is things that look like something Fisher-Price made. Why have\ntwo buttons on a mouse when you can\nhave one? Why ask the user what they\nwant from a machine when you can\nconvince them they need it all? Why\nkeep it the size it is now when you\ncan make it smaller? The idea seems\nto be that if you can remove the need\nto learn how technology works then\nthat means you\u2019re doing the right thing\nfor the public. We\u2019ve thought about it\ngood and hard and decided that nothing good comes of actually learning\nthings and that it\u2019s probably best if we\njust dumb down mankind\u2019s greatest\nachievements so that everyone can just\nsmack their heads against a red button\nthat says \u2018EMAIL\u2019 and it\u2019ll just write \u2018lol\u2019\nin reply to everything in your inbox.\nIt originated out of a need to placate\nthe older generation, who were seen as\nbeing left out of the technological fu-ture. But when the generations below\nus picked it up too it became evident\nthat far from including those that were\nunlikely to be able to learn how to access these services we were really setting the bar low for the future. We were\nsaying that complexity was bad and that\nif it needed more than five minutes of\nremembering stuff then that was just\ninconsiderate towards the consumer.\nWell, good luck with that. I\u2019m now\nofficially a technology snob. You fuckers riding the Web 2.0 wave can do so\nuntil it crashes on the sands of idiocy\nand crushes your feeble skulls. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll start organising my life,\nbreezing through work and soaking up\nthe sweet satisfaction of understanding how to use masks in Photoshop\nCS. Technology requires learning. It\u2019s\na language, a skill. But that\u2019s like, ef-fort, right? And since when did anything ever come about through effort?\nFuck that for a game of soldiers! Let\u2019s\nall go back to mashing our iPod Touch\nscreens.\nThink I\u2019m wrong? Mash your keyboard with badly-formed sentences\nof anger in an email to anangrygeek@\ngooglemail.com.

You arsehole.\nI could be angry if I wanted to be...\nNew Imperial Girl: Internet dating\nImperial Girl\nD\nespite Jovan\u2019s persuasions to get me to choose\na more creative \u2018writername\u2019 I\u2019ve decided to\nkeep it straightforward\nand meaningful - just how I hope my\ncolumn to be received. There is no\nneed for too much of an introduction\nbecause my name says it all: I am a girl\nand I am studying at Imperial.\nIn these articles I want to talk about\nthings that keep me thinking, wondering and debating with myself. Last year\nwhilst studying for exams (for those\nquick people you will have already deduce that \u2018last year\u2019 = 2nd year or >) I\nwatched multiple episodes of Sex and\nthe City and I realised that maybe by\nwriting these articles anonymously I\nmight be able to relate a small part of\nmy life to you readers. I emphasis that\nwhat I will continue to write about is\nmy personal experience; it by no means\ngeneralises for any group of people.\nBeing at Imperial can be tough for a\ngirl. We can\u2019t be too \u2018girly\u2019 else we get\nostracised by the outweighing majority of boys on campus but we can\u2019t in\nturn become the Tomboy else we will\nnever get asked out on dates. But whatever tactic you use as a girl on campus,\nI find that it doesn\u2019t make a huge difference to your dating life. With this in\nmind I was recently introduced to this\nguy online who lives in Australia. Originally I was only talking to him because\nI needed some guidance on some area\nof studying but when we first started\ntalking on Skype I realised that we had\nclicked instantly. I could tell that we\nboth felt it. But even though internet\ndating is so taboo and long distance\nrelationships never work, I had an urge\nto be in a relationship with this guy\nwho I had never met.\nThen I started thinking, 70% of the\npopulation at Imperial are guys (don\u2019t\nquote me on this) and I haven\u2019t had\nthese feelings for anyone of them.\nWhy? Maybe it was a consequence\nof the situation, neither of us have\nwebcams so neither of us knew what\neach other look like (of course we have\nsince added each other as friends on\nFacebook, come on!!). But for the first\nfew conversations we knew only each\nother\u2019s name and country of residence.\nThere was no pressure, a perfect opportunity to get to know each other in\nthe most non-superficial way. Maybe\nthat is it? We live in such a superficial society where what you wear and\nhow you look generally define you as\na person. I am not denying that I am a\nfollower, I do think it\u2019s important but\nmaybe it\u2019s time that we had a visor that\nblanks the exterior and allows us to see\nour potential boyfriends/girlfriends for\nwho they really are.\nI\u2019ll give you another example, I used\nto crave this boy - his sense of style was\nso HOT, he had a beautiful face and\nhe was exactly of the physique I liked.\nThe other day whilst walking into college down Queens Gate I thought I saw\nhim. I felt a rush as I remembered how\nI really \u2018liked\u2019 him. I wasn\u2019t wearing my\ncontacts so as I got closer I realised\nit was just another guy with the same\nsense of fashion and hairstyle. \u201cDamn,\u201d\nI thought, \u201cis that all there was to my\nattraction?\u201d I really only \u2018liked\u2019 the way\nhe looked and that was it. I can\u2019t fool\nmyself that it was anything more but is\nthat all it takes?\nMaybe it\u2019s time that we give our eyes\na break and let our ears and mind decide for us. If only guys at Imperial\nwould see that girls like myself want to\nbe judged for who they are and for our\nphysical attractiveness to come secondary to this. No?\nAmin Elmubarak\nCaz is free to speak again\nT\nhe second time a felix\ncontributor has written\na response to one of my\nown comment pieces and\nI, once again, find myself\nflattered although I am sure it is not\nout of sycophancy that these responses have come to be. That my opinion\nhas caught the eye of another and has\nsparked a debate is enough to please\nme greatly.\nThis time Abdul Hannan has put\nforward his own views on Freedom\nof Speech, which I argued vehemently\nin favour of in my commentary on the\nsubject. He first points out that this notion of Freedom of Speech is very much\na concept originating and enforced by\n\u2018civilized society\u2019, in this case the Western world. He makes a valid point as\nmany societies outside the Western\nrealms do not experience so much of\nthe freedom we enjoy here due to religious or political history; the collectivist approach in Communist China,\nfor example. Abdul seems to imply by\nwriting \u2018it is this Freedom loving society that screams from mountain-tops\nwhen anyone dares to question the\nconcept of Freedom\u2019, that to strive for\nfreedom of speech, thought and action\nis something which should be abated.\nAdmittedly, there cannot and should\nnot be absolute freedom of action lest\nthe world descends into anarchy. In a\nperfect world there would be absolute\nfreedom of action where we humans\nwould exist at an elevated moral level\nand so the question of anarchy would\nnot arise; utopia would have been\nreached and we would be back living in\nthe proverbial Garden of Eden! This is\ncompletely unattainable.\nDepending on your beliefs, we are\neach unique individuals, no one is\nthe same, and with this should come\nthe basic human right of freedom to\nchose the way we live and behave. As\nable minded people we do have absolute freedom of speech (we control the\nwords that emit from our mouths) but\nwhen exercised this may lead to unfair\ncriticism of a person or group. This\nis where we need to use our sensitivity and discretion so as not to appear\noafish and on a mission just to inspire\nhate; either chose to refrain or rethink\nhow we express our views.\n\u2018Terrorists? Which terrorist groups\ndoes Caz refer to anyway?... Caz quite\nunashamedly has used conformist self-censorship, to be as vague as possible\u2019.\nHere I stand corrected in my hasty\nuse of the word \u2018terrorist\u2019. Of course, I\nshould have made it clear I was referring to the Islamic terrorists who responded to the move to publish \u2018The\nJewel of Medina\u2019 with an attempted\nbombing of the home of the owner\nof Gibson Square publishing house.\nHowever, due to the content of the\nnovel (which explores the prophet Muhammad\u2019s relationship with his bride\nAisha) as well as the large amount of\nIslamic terrorist activity occurring in\nrecent years, it would be clear that it\nwas Islamic terrorists that took objection to a book that supposedly slates\ntheir religion. It would not have been\nracist to state originally that these were\nIslamic terrorists, that would be a mere\nstatement of fact.\nI have to strongly disagree with Abdul\u2019s \u2018implicit advice\u2019 to Muslims that\nif they object to a book of this nature\nthat they are a terrorist. One steps over\nthe border into terrorism when one\nbegins putting explosives through letter boxes! To object to a publication is\ncompletely legitimate, just as much as\nthe publication itself, and is in accordance with this very idea of freedom.\n\u2018It is this Freedom loving society\nwhich evangelically chooses to impart its values to the rest of the world,\nthrough coercion and bullying.\u2019 It is\nthis fact and the conduct of the Western world that riled Islamic extremists\nto launch an attack on America seven\nyears ago on September 11. Because\nof this attack our own freedom in the\nwest, most notably at airports, has\nbeen impinged upon. It seems that the\n\u2018terrorists\u2019 have got their way. (By no\nmeans am I implying we should take a\ncavalier approach to security.)\nAbdul makes some excellent points\nabout the apparent \u2018catch-22\u2019 of Freedom of Speech \u2013 it can never be absolute as the manifestation of one person\u2019s freedom will conflict with that of\nanother. Here in felix we have a good\nexample of Freedom of Speech by the\npresence of these opinion columns. I\nhave voiced my views and he has expressed his. Both are valid arguments\nand ideas which have inspired free\nthinking and debate and I welcome anyone else\u2019s thoughts on this paradoxical notion and, indeed, any others.\nCaz Knight\nI\n\u2019ve always been a little bit unsure\nabout sharing this page in the\nnewspaper. I feel like the psychiatric patient who\u2019s been thrown\ninto the wrong wing of the\nasylum: I\u2019m the gentle manic depressive who hears voices (played by Tom\nHanks, perhaps \u2013 or a young Dustin\nHoffman) suddenly surrounded by the\nparanoiac sociopaths one particularly\nrapid heartbeat away from an apoplectic fit.\nAnger seems to be of the essence in\nwriting a comment piece today. Jeremy\nClarkson, who in many ways has come\nto represent what a 21st Century columnist should be like, seems to have\nfound the elixir of middle-age with\nhis unique cocktail of gasoline, vitriol,\nloud metaphor and overblown, unconventional simile. Gordon Ramsay also\nseems to have soared to popularity on\nsimilar wings, as the first chef to fricassee and say a frick on live television.\nNow I just don\u2019t get that angry about\nlife. I wish I did \u2013 God knows it would\nmake these pieces easier to write and,\nI imagine, more enjoyable to read. It\u2019s\nvery easy to summon anger, and though\nchannelling it into humour is harder,\nit\u2019s always effective. So here I am, with\na rich, bellicose vein of comic material\nthat I just can\u2019t access. Because either\nI don\u2019t care enough about things to let\nthem irritate me, or I care too much to\nresort to cheap, knee-jerk reactions to\nget a laugh.\nBut this week I seem to have hit the\nright frame of mind. Various grotesque\nacquaintances of mine have been getting on my goat (a cheap joke about\nWelsh sexual practices was wisely removed in the edit). The reasons are entirely unimportant: in fact, my flatmate\ndared me to infuse all 800 of today\u2019s\nmeticulously-chosen words with the\nfull Satanic force of my rage, and not\nonce mention the reason for my fury.\nGoing round in such vicious circles is,\nunfortunately, beyond my rhetorical\nskills.\nI have also managed to calm down\nconsiderably. The thing with me is\nthat my natural state of equilibrium\nis distasteful apathy. People and situations might initially get on my nerves,\nbut it will always end in a wry smile of\nthe greatest possible passive aggression and a general hatred for human-ity. Lectures on Monday afternoons,\nfor instance, are particularly good at\ngetting me into that mood. Spending\nthree hours in a crowded room with\n200 physicists after the freedom of the\nweekend is enough to drain me of all\nrespect or affection for our misguided species. But not enough to get me\nangry.\nOn rare occasions, however, a particularly febrile anthropoid can succeed in denting the calm shell of my\nmental stability. And this week, you\nguessed it, was one of those times. So\nmy temper has been rising. My blood,\nas darling Gordon recommends, has\nbeen set to a gentle simmer. The milk\nof human kindness, which ordinarily\nflows through my veins like spring water running across Swiss countryside,\nhas been curdling.\nAnd, Jesus, it\u2019s amazing how morally satisfying rage can be. Even vacu-ous, pointless anger is a guaranteed\npick-me-up. It sharpens the senses\nand heightens awareness: it gives you\nsomething to focus on. The thing\nabout human psychology is that focus is a guaranteed path to happiness.\nEastern meditation emphasizes focus\non emptiness as the path to nirvana,\nbut total investment in any of our materialistic Western substitutes works\nwell enough. Some people are satisfied by total commitment to another\nperson, others devote hours on end to\nwork of one kind or another, and some\ndedicate themselves to collecting ex-periences, books, points in an online\ngame, academic awards or rare 1920s\nstamps from the Outer Hebrides.\nIt is much easier, however, to be focused on an emotion. Many lovers\nderive greater consolation from being\nin love than they do from each other\u2019s\ncompany, and God knows how many\nteenage or tweeny sods have powered\ntheir internal motors on the consolation they derive from a good wallow. I,\nand I know I am not alone, am able to\ngo for days on the power of fury. While\nthere is certainly something cathartic\nin writing an amusing article about\nsome erstwhile irritant, there is more\nthan emotional cleansing going on.\nRage, like self-pity and, to a lesser\nextent, love, is hugely self-indulgent. A\ngood fume makes us feel important. It\nmakes us feel as though our opinions\nmatter and that we have enough experience to make judgements that count.\nTo be able to condemn something or\nsomeone and raise a criticism or a compliment indicates the value of our own\nopinions and heightens our feelings of\npower. Getting angry over trivialities is\na way of patting ourselves on the back\nfor how well we think and how insight-fully we can analyse situations.\nHence the mileage we comic writers (\u2018we happy few\u2019, indeed) are wont\nto squeeze out of frustration. And,\nhypocrite that I am, though I\u2019ve covered ground on the same issue, at least\ntoday rage and frustration were riding\nin the passenger seat and not powering\nthe car.\nThe Editor\u2019s idea of an amusing inset. My idea of an amusing caption.\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nFriday 31 October 2008 felix\nArts\nOooh, swirly. This delightful little nugget of hypnotism is the oh-so-originally-named \u201cTwo Spirals\u201d by Mir\u00f3\u2019s bestie, Alexander Calder\nMaeght and the other two artists featured in this exhibition. I leave room\ntwo reluctantly and move on to room\nthree, which is filled with Georges\nBraque and Alberto Giacometti. The\ntwo are certainly very similar in their\ndark and sombre mood. They are abstract while their subject matter originates in reality. Braque created Cubism\nalongside Pablo Picasso in 1909-1910,\nwhile Giacometti was apparently the\nfavoured artist of the French existentialist writers led by Jean-Paul Sartre in\nthe 1950s. Damn him \u2013 I wish I could\nbe the favourite artist of a group of existentialist writers. I think it would be a\nwise career move for me.\nThe series of small landscapes in\nthick, decorative frames on the first\nwall by Braque are a little drab and un-exciting, but quietly charming. They\nare rich in texture with their deep layers of paint. Overall, I\u2019m not so keen\non Braque as I am on Mir\u00f3 and Calder.\nSome of his work is a bit, let\u2019s face it,\nugly. Brown and angry and sometimes\ntoo serious. There\u2019s a hint of the Picasso about them, as is evident in\n\u201cWoman Lying Down\u201d (1930-1956),\nbut then they are closely associated\ncontemporaries. \u201cThe Echo\u201d (1953-1956) is a good summary of what\nBraque is all about, but isn\u2019t pleasant to\nlook at and makes my eyes hurt. It\u2019s all\nconfused lines and unattractive rusty,\npinky browns and yellow with a brown\nand grey background. It seems to be a\nstill life but it\u2019s hard to tell. Giacometti\nwas obviously into his sculptures, like\n\u201cWalking Man\u201d (1960) and \u201cStanding\nWoman\u201d (1960). They\u2019re elongated,\nrough, green and knobbly. I don\u2019t really like them and they feel a little out\nof place in this exhibition. His nearby\npaintings, like \u201cThe House Opposite\u201d\n(1952) are a bit better, in a sketchy,\nscratchy, grey sort of way. Still not\ngreat though.\nRoom four is a delve back into what\nI like, with a wall full of covers from\nlithography expert Maeght\u2019s arty periodical \u201cDerri\u00e8re le Mir\u00f3ir\u201d, all illustrated by different artists. The artists\u2019\nnames are on each cover, declaring\nthemselves proudly. There are famous\nnames here like Chagall, Leger and\nKandinsky, and Mir\u00f3 sneaks himself in\nmany times. These covers are colourful\nand varied \u2013 a feast of visual delights\nrepresentative of an exciting period\nin art history. In the glass case in the\ncentre of the room are inside pages\ntaken from the periodical that feature\nsleek and decorative French writing\nand Mir\u00f3\u2019s doodling and abstract dec-oration. On the wall behind are a few\nmodernist, poster-style Calder works,\nbig and bold. \u201cTwo Spirals\u201d (1974) is\njust that, looking like a white snail on\na red background. I like the fitting title attached to some white discs on a\nblack background \u2013 \u201cSaucers in the\nDark\u201d (1969).\nThe exhibition is only four rooms,\nand at \u00a37 for a student ticket it feels it\u2019s\na bit pricier than it should be. Particularly since I forked out another tenner\nbetween the gift shop and the restau-rant. I\u2019d never been to the restaurant\nbut it was very nice indeed, decorated\nwith arty murals and wood panelling.\nIt provided a decent cappuccino, staff\nwho treat you like royalty (paying this\nmuch, I probably should be) and a suitable range of cake. I sampled the plum\nfrangipani tart, which sounds a lot\nposher than it really was \u2013 spongy cake\nwith the odd bit of plum. Quite pleasing though not outstanding.\nCake aside, the exhibition, which is\nperfectly put together, well-explained\nand manageable, covers a very accessible period in art history, so even art\nnovices will be satisfied if they feel like\ncoughing up the cash to see it. It\u2019s one\nof those exhibitions that succeeds in\nnot only showing you some really good\nart but also in letting you get to know\nthe artists. It reveals them as being a\nfew blokes having a bit of fun with\nsome paints, making us smile \u2013 I think\nthis revelation is often key in appreciating more modern art forms. My one\ncriticism is that even though the exhibition is supposed to focus on Maeght,\nwe don\u2019t find out much about him as\na person or his accomplishments. It\u2019s\nmore about the four featured artists, so\npoor Maeght gets left in the shadows\na little. Despite that minor grumble,\nthis is certainly one of my favourite\nexhibitions of all time, if only just for\nthe Mir\u00f3s and Calders. While the Tate\nseems to get a bit more irritating and\noverpriced every time I go, I think the\nhigh-class but tucked away RA has deservedly overtaken them as my favourite art institution.\nThe exhibition \u201cMir\u00f3, Calder, Giacometti, Braque: Aim\u00e9 Maeght\nand His Artists\u201d (bit of a mouthful\nat the ticket office) is on now at\nthe Royal Academy and until 2\nJan 2009, so no excuses!\nI Would Like to Be a\nDot in a Painting by Miro\nby Moniza Alvi\nI would like to be a dot in a painting by Miro.\nBarely distinguishable from other dots,\nit\u2019s true, but quite uniquely placed.\nAnd from my dark centre\nI\u2019d survey the beauty of the linescape\nand wonder -- would it be worthwhile\nto roll myself towards the lemon stripe,\nCentrally poised, and push my curves\nagainst its edge, to give myself\na little attention?\nBut it\u2019s fine where I am.\nI\u2019ll never make out what\u2019s going on\naround me, and that\u2019s the joy of it.\nThe fact that I\u2019m not a perfect circle\nmakes me more interesting in this world.\nPeople will stare forever --Even the most unemotional get excited.\nSo here I am, on the edge of animation,\na dream, a dance,a fantastic construction,\nA child\u2019s adventure.\nAnd nothing in this tawny sky\ncan get too close, or move too far away.\n22 felix Friday 31 October 2008\nCulture &\nThe Arts\nArts Editors \u2013 Caz Knight, David Paw and Emily Wilson\nBudding culture vulture? Write for us\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nEmily Wilson\nArts Editor\nT\nhe week I take my turn at\nplaying Arts Editor generally commences with me\nlying awake at four in the\nmorning thinking about\nhow I\u2019ll be spending my afternoon in\nthe humid cave that is the Felix office.\nThis is followed by a mental run-through of what I have (or, more often,\ndo not have) to fill the arts section\nwith that week, inevitably leading into\n\u201cWhat the heck am I going to write\nin my editorial?\u201d. The last one elicited\ntwo positive/neutral comments (this is\na veritable triumph by normal stand-ards) and three negative comments\nalong the lines of \u201cJeez, Emily, why\ndon\u2019t you get a blog or something?\u201d.\nWhile still lying in bed, I did mentally draft a witty and informative editorial along the lines of \u2018Emily\u2019s FoolProof Formula for Writing for the Arts\nSection\u2019. In my head, at four thirty in\nthe morning, it was pretty good. Highlights were going to be \u201cinsert pop culture references like you\u2019re starring in\nThe Gilmore Girls\u201d (that being a pop\nculture reference in itself, oh yesss) and\nmy advice to always end your review\nwith a brief discussion of the range and\nquality of beverage offered at the ven-ue. But, let\u2019s face it, I don\u2019t want to give\naway all the secrets of my genius and,\nmore importantly, ideas that seemed\ngood at four thirty in the morning\nseem less good when you sit down in\nfront of your computer. Anyway, I will\ntry to be a good little Arts Editor and\nlimit myself to artistic chit-chat from\nnow on.\nWhat have I got for you this week?\nLots! I started the week with only two\npieces. Firstly, my own ecstatic ramblings about the Maeght exhibition at\nthe RA accompanied by my favourite\npoem, which happens to be about some\nof the art in said exhibition. Secondly,\nwe have a major feature on Imagine\nThis by Lucy Harrold (now a regular\nfixture in Felix), who was lucky enough\nto sit in on a tech rehearsal and chat to\nthe producer. Two double-page spreads\nis more than sufficient for an arts sec-tion, so I was positively bowled over\nwhen co-editor Caz Knight emailed\nthree more articles in! Caz herself has\nsent in a book review, and we\u2019ve also\ngot reviews of exhibitions about Andy\nWarhol and Cold War design. You\u2019re\ngetting keen, guys, and I like it! Please\ndo keep sending in your articles, even if\nit means I have to spend a couple more\nhours in the Felix cave. The address, of\ncourse, is arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhat can you expect from me in future Felixes? I\u2019m still planning to write\nabout a few little-known museums\nand galleries dotted about London, as\nI think I promised you some time last\nyear. I\u2019m also determined to write a\nbook review, to prove Caz isn\u2019t the only\nliterary one around here. But first, I\nneed to finish the 900-page door stopper I\u2019ve got in mind. Watch this space..\nMiro, Miro, on the wall...\nMaeght knew talent when he saw it, as an exciting new RA exhibition proves. Emily\nWilson embarrasses herself in a lift, has a minor orgasm and blows with old ladies\nOne of the Calder mobiles that now probably has spit all over it. Sorry, Calder. The old lady made me do it\nI\nn the shadow of the big Francis\nBacon and Rothko exhibitions\non at their respective Tates, I\nonly found out about this exhibition from advertising on the\nside of telephone boxes. Even within\nthe Royal Academy itself the exhibition\nis tucked away up in the Sackler Wing,\nnot in the main exhibition galleries.\nOnce I bought my \u00a37 student ticket,\nI nearly didn\u2019t find the exhibition - it\nwas so well hidden. Unable to find\nthe stairs, I resorted to the lift where\na well-spoken lift attendant (do they\nreally need to pay somebody to push\nbuttons all day?) called me \u201cmadam\u201d\nmultiple times. Which was somewhat\nembarrassing. But thank goodness I\nfound this little exhibition, because it\nwas one of the best I\u2019ve ever been to.\nThe exhibition is based on the French\nart dealer, patron and publisher Aim\u00e9\nMaeght (1906-1981), his wife Marguerite and the artists he supported. The\nintroductory section includes Pierre\nBonnard and Henri Matisse, two artists who started Maeght\u2019s career. Bonnard appears to be a softer, wishy-washier version of the better-known\nMatisse, judging by \u201cSummer\u201d (1917)\nin the first room which is fluffy and\nhazy. To its right are some charcoal\nsketches and line drawings which are\nclassically Matisse. Matisse\u2019s small but\nsignificant presence in this exhibition\nhas not been advertised and so, comes\nas a pleasant surprise. A highlight is\n\u201cThe Bush\u201d (1951).\nThe first two of the big four artists\nassociated with Maeght are the Spanish Catalan artist Joan Mir\u00f3 and the\nAmerican Alexander Calder. Being a\nmajor Mir\u00f3 fan, I had a minor orgasmic moment as I stepped into room\ntwo. Mir\u00f3\u2019s here in a big way, filling the\nroom with a rainbow of bright colours,\naccompanied by his mate Calder. The\nbiographical information informed\nme that they were close chums until\nCalder died. Good old Maeght was\nresponsible for a number of Mir\u00f3\u2019s\nexhibitions and for encouraging him\nto work in a greater range of media.\nCalder\u2019s mobiles and stabiles (like a\nmobile but on the ground and, er, not\nmoving) are instantly recognizable. I\nlove them. It\u2019s always a treat to see art\nsuspended from the ceiling instead of\nfixed flat to the wall. Look at the shadows cast by the mobiles on to the walls\nof the gallery. They are almost better\nthan the mobiles themselves. Mir\u00f3\u2019s\n\u201cPoem\u201d (1966) is utterly beautiful. It\u2019s a\nsplattering of abstract shapes and coloured splotches. I can see a bowler hat\ntowards the bottom. I spend a few moments trying to decide which coloured\nsplotch I would like to be reincarnated\nas. The pale lilac one in the middle is\ntempting, as is a red one on the right.\nThis is exactly the kind of art that I get\npassionate about. Already I\u2019m enjoying this exhibition so much I\u2019m close\nto tears.\nThe glass case in the centre of the\nsecond room is filled with delights,\nincluding miniature Calder mobiles\nsmall enough to sneak into my handbag (if only!). There\u2019s also \u201cThinking\nAbout Sandy, Sandy\u201d (1973) by Mir\u00f3,\nwhich is scrawled words in swirly\nhandwriting on top of plain blocks\nof primary colour. I can\u2019t understand\nthe Spanish words. All I can pick out\nis \u201cSandy\u201d. Next to it, is a small sculpture by Calder of a cat\u2019s head with pipe\ncleaner-like whiskers, grafted onto a\nbody like a trickle of paint. Unsurprisingly it\u2019s called \u201cCat Snake\u201d (1968). It\u2019s\na little bit sinister when you first look at\nit, but it grows on me the more I look.\nOn the other side of the case are \u201cBird\nwith Balls\u201d (1954) and \u201cBird with Spectacles\u201d (1930) which are wire birds,\none with a crude cock and testicles\ndangling from its body (looking more\nlike it\u2019s carrying a pair of scissors), the\nother holding a pair of glasses on a\nstick in its foot as if watching a rather\nengaging opera. They should sell replicas of these in the gift shop because\nthey\u2019re so fun. Then again, you could\nprobably twist round a coat hanger and\nmake your own. It amuses me how rich\nold ladies keep walking past \u201cBird with\nBalls\u201d and cackling.\n\u201cNorth-South\u201d by Mir\u00f3 is more conventional in form \u2013 a still life of objects\non a table, in a na\u00efve style and crude\ncolours. I particularly like the squashy-looking pear and the sweet little goldfinch in its cage. This is a painting I\nwould love to have on the wall at home.\nI wonder vaguely if I could buy a print\nof it.\nI see a middle-aged woman standing in front of a Calder mobile, sneak-ily blowing on it to make it move. The\nshadow twists and turns behind it.\nI stop to admire. We briefly discuss\nhow gorgeous the mobile is and she\ninvites me to blow with her. I stand beside her but I\u2019m laughing too much to\ncontribute.\n\u201cThe Birds of Prey Swoop Down On\nOurShadows\u201dbyMir\u00f3ispaintsplashed\nand spread in thick lines against what\nis at first, a strange and unidentifiable\ncanvas, which turns out to be cowskin.\nIt adds a whole new dimension of texture and feeling with its softness and\nwrinkles. \u201cConstellation\u201d, also by Mir\u00f3,\nis an abrupt and out-of-place, oversized statue at the end of room two. It\nis a very dark midnight green and looks\nlike half an avocado with the stone still\nembedded in the middle.\nThe handout booklet is less informative about the connection between\nThis is what Giacometti thought made for good art.

Don\u2019t be scared, it\u2019s a\npiece of cake...\nI\nn this week\u2019s section we feature\nthe best of London\u2019s Halloween events. It seems Halloween\nnights are taking dressing up\nand snacks to the extreme. This\nyear fetishism and cakes are where it\u2019s\nat.\nPushing boundaries is an obvious\nimprovement on those supposedly\nscary Halloween club nights. Those\nones where spray cobwebs and pumpkin lanterns rule. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree\nthese are frankly a bit lame. Halloween\nis a night where you have the freedom\nto leave your inhibitions aside and take\nlicense to dress up as your will desires.\nThe more experimental student can\nhead off to Striplite at London Stone,\nCannon Street. Putting inhibitions\naside, this Surrealist Halloween night\npromises to bring alive your wildest\nfantasies and deepest desires.\nThe dress code for Striplite is alter-native, fetish and creative dress. Nudity\nis strictly prohibited. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly fetish friendly,\u201d say The Fetishistas, \u201c...felt\nto me less like a club and more like a\nbig house party. And if that doesn\u2019t get\nyou along, then the cupcakes certainly\nshould.\u201d\nCakes seem to be infiltrating every\nsocial event, from the Knit Soc Monday meet up in the union bar to fetish\nnights.\nServing more than just an innocent\nmuffin, Striplite are serving their \u2018famous burlesque cupcakes\u2019.\nTo add to proceedings there will be\nentertainment in the form of a gory\nballoon dance, face painting and a dark\ncomedy on transgender antics.\nIf you want a slice of the cake and\nfetish action festivities start at 10pm.\nEntrance is \u00a35, \u00a34 with a flyer.\nElsewhere, if you fancy something\na bit more straightforward \u2018This Is\nNot London\u2019 is back again this week-end. The devilish Halloween Special is\n\u00a36.66 in advance or \u00a310 on the door.\nHeadliner\u2019s Zombie Nation are performing live.\nUltra-cool celebrity haunt Punk has\nanother quirky Halloween night on this\nFriday. You know the place, it\u2019s where\nKate Moss, Agyness Dean and Lily Allen get papped leaving drunk at 3am.\nOn Friday the kitsch cool club has\na night of Halloween shenanigans\nplanned.

I know, forgive me.\nHowever, during my time at Imperial\nCollege, I have taken a keen interest\nin the welfare of the student body, and\nthe benefits the student Union should\nprovide to the current and upcoming\ngenerations of this prestigious univer-sity. I would like to think of myself as a\nfun, outgoing and social person. However this is only my opinion, and probably not want you want to hear.\nAs a Student Trustee, I will endeavor\nto guide the Trustee board (the governing body in the operation of the Union)\nin a more just and student-oriented di-rection. I have great confidence that I\nam an accurate description of the average IC student, and as such, will grapple the throats of the Union sabbaticals\nother Union staff to gain a fair and just\nposition for us students.\nI don\u2019t think my past year would have\nbeen any different if the GSA didn\u2019t ex-ist. Most postgraduates I\u2019ve brought\nup the the GSA with, don\u2019t know what\nthe acronym stands for, or what it\u2019s\nsupposed to do. Which, let\u2019s face it, is\ndiabolical. I shall not attempt to slate\nthe existing team or beguile you with\npromises of realising some utopian reunification between academia and social inclusion, but I could radically improve things. I don\u2019t believe academia\nhas to be a sanctuary for the socially\nrepressed, so let\u2019s not let it be. Things\ncould be a lot, lot better. Conformity\nsuggests I should inform you of my experience running societies and events,\nbut that will seriously impinge upon\non the 150 word-limit. Essentially, I\nsee the main focus of the GSA being\npostgraduate welfare and filling in the\nPG social-gaps the main union leaves.\nThanks, Rhys.\nRhys Morgan\nGSA\nGSA Chairman\nJenny Lim\nGSA Secretary\nHELLO ALL! My name is Jenny Lim\nand I\u2019m standing for the position of\nGSA Secretary. I\u2019ve always wanted\nto get involved in a committee and\nthought - this year is going to be the\nyear!\nTo be quite honest, I\u2019m not really\nsure what the role will require of me,\nexcept that I will be able to push forward views of the graduates to the GSA\nfor: A.C.T.I.O.N! I will definitely work\nhard to make it a successful year for all\nof us!\nImportantly, I\u2019m based at Hammersmith Campus which can be quite\nunder-represented, so I will take good\nnote of the views of students at this\ncampus to ensure they get their say on\nthings! That won\u2019t mean neglecting the\nrest of you, of course! Actions speak\nlouder than words so... just vote for me\nand you won\u2019t be disappointed! I look\nforward to meeting you all!\nTom Van Den Bremer is also running for\nthis position, but has not submitted a\nphoto or a manifesto.\nRONre\n-open\nnominations\nSeveral other positions are still available in the GSA. If you wish to stand for these po-sitions, come to Council on 17th November in the Union Dining Hall\nAs a five-time (local) Emmy Awardwinning journalist, and the main anchor for the KVWN Channel Four\nNews Team, I know I\u2019m good. I mean\nreally good. Hey everyone, come and\nsee how good I look.\nAnyway, these guys are major league\nbull. If you like me more than you like\nthem, because lets be honest I am the\nRon Burgundy, then don\u2019t waste your\nscotch by throwing it in their faces. I\nlove scotch. Scotchy, scotch, scotch.\nHere it goes down, down into my\nbelly... yeah!

Often pictured\nas a voyeur, Warhol used photography to catch personal individualities\nin different lights from the 1950s on-ward, and later started experimenting\nwith new media such as audiotapes\nand videos in 1960s. His entourage as\nwell as himself were the source of his\ninspiration and many of his pieces are\nbased in his New York studio, known\nas the Factory. The results exposed at\nthe Hayward Gallery gives the visitor\na holistic introspection into Warhol\u2019s\nludicrous world , filled with drama, hypochondria and hypersexualisation.\nThe fact that most videos and recordings are from very common settings and made in a \u201chome-movie\u201d\nfashion gives the impression of sharing\npersonal, almost private moments of\nthe artist\u2019s life. The Factory Diaries, a\nseries of videos capturing often absurd\ndaily events of him and his crew at the\nFactory during the 70s and 80s, show\nthe creative process of Warhol who\nwas stirred by the gossips, chats and\nconfessions of fellow humans. Sometimes criticized for being artificial and\nshallow, Warhol admitted that \u201call [his]\nfilms are artificial, but then everything\nis sort of artificial\u201d as well. It is during\nthe 1980s that Warhol starts a television series named \u201cAndy Warhol\u2019s Fifteen Minutes\u201d that is broadcasted on\nthe new MTV channel. The television\nprogramme was mostly famous because Warhol coined the concept of\n\u201cfifteen minutes of fame\u201d while talking\nabout the short attention span of popular culture upon mediatised objects.\nA broad collection of various episodes\nfrom that series and from other television productions realized in the same\nperiod, show that the concept was also\napplied in the production techniques:\nmost episodes are a collection of short\nskits skipping quickly from one topic\nto another, ranging from fashion, to\nsex, death, money, success and other\nabsorbing nonsense. Over and again,\nWarhol transformed the end in the\nmean; materialized the message in the\nmedium.\nIngeniously presented in a series of\nlarge rooms with all the space needed\nto breathe in the creations, \u201cOther\nVoices, Other Rooms\u201d can take you up\nfor the entire day if you let yourself get\nlost in the deliriously frank pieces as-sembled. The overall experience leaves\nyou with a more than realistic insight\nof North America\u2019s lost and lustful so-ciety, convened through the paradox of\ndeep artificiality his pieces depict. Even\nafter all the feasts and freaks around\nhim, Andy Warhol was nonetheless\none of the most lucid artists of his era.\nAndy Warhold: Other Voices,\nOther Rooms - at the Hayward\nGallery until 18 January 2009\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas\nCaz Knight offers us another handy review of a classic novel - this time with a scandalously sinful slant\nP\nerhaps Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage\nJourney to the Heart of the\nAmerican Dream should be\nrenamed Every Felony, Sin and Vice in\nLas Vegas, as that is certainly what is\nexperienced as we are jerked into the\nheart of that Dream: dragged along\nthrough commotion, irresponsible and\ndepraved ether binges and the \u201cSixth\nReich\u201d. Based on real life events with\nsome fiction thrown in, Thompson, as\nhis Hawaiian shirt, mirrored-aviator-wearing \u201calter ego\u201d Raoul Duke, is sent\nto Las Vegas with his Samoan attorney,\nDr Gonzo, to report on the Mint 400\noff-road desert motorcycle race and\nfind the hideous \u201cnerve centre\u201d of the\nAmerican Dream, all the while fully\nimmersing himself in proceedings in\nthe true spirit of Gonzo journalism.\nPerhaps the antithesis of convention-al, objective newspaper journalism,\nGonzo journalism is highly subjective,\ncarried out with reckless abandon by\nthe writer who becomes a part of the\nstory he is covering, reporting in the\nfirst person and accessorising his piece\nwith personal experience, humour, ex-aggeration, touches of fiction and pro-fanity. The idea being that the essence\nof the subject matter is better conveyed\nwith exaggerated imagery, fiction often\nbeing the best fact. \u201cGonzo\u201d originating from Irish slang for the last man\nstanding after a night\u2019s drinking, perfectly fitting given the tireless antics\nof Duke in the novel and his penchant\nfor alcohol, drugs, violence and insan-ity. (Which he wouldn\u2019t advocate to\nanybody though they worked for him,\nuntil his suicide.)\nAspiring writers and readers alike\nwill both marvel at and covet the ease\nwith which he creates and pours out\nsuch witty commentary on people and\nsituations manifesting as a by-product\nof Las Vegas - the American Dream at\nwork. His concise style - utterly devoid\nof clich\u00e9 and stream of consciousness\nor inner monologue - at times highly\ncolloquial without losing any of its po-tency, still manages to conjure a storm\nof colour, place, scene, setting and craziness which fill each short chapter\nmaking it so effortless to read - perfect\nfor dipping into in short bursts on the\ntube, between lectures. Thompson has\ndone all the work for us, our imagination is given a treat as our brains can\nrest without the effort often required\nfrom other, \u201cheftier\u201d classics.\nDuke\u2019s twitchy, impetuous nature,\nmannerisms and thought are conveyed\nbeautifully through a literary style of\nthe same nature that also provides us\nwith insightful and thoughtful musings\non historical, political and social issues that underlie Thompson\u2019s hatred\nof Nixon, disdain of authority and experience of the optimistic \u201cspeed that\nfueled the sixties\u201d. The scenarios which\nDuke and his attorney find themselves\nin and create for themselves, put one\nin awe of their temerity and improvisational skills - all this being carried\nout utterly sideways on one or another\n(psychedelic) drug. Obviously, he is a\nman of iron constitution (\u201cit never got\nweird enough for me\u201d, said Thompson)\nto survive five days in Las Vegas with\nno sleep, his fear about his countless\npetty crimes heightened by amphetamine paranoia, while still trying to\ncover the Mint 400 and then onto an\nanti-drugs convention for over a thousand middle-American hick cops.\nHis quest for the American Dream is\nfulfilled and found to be a truly gruesome thing, which has one recoiling in\nhorror at Western society\u2019s downhill\ntrajectory. As we live it through Duke\u2019s\nexperience of that superficial, surreal\ncity feeling, it\u2019s as if we too, have taken\nsomething mind-altering. It is upon\nreading the book that one realises just\nhow true Terry Gilliam has stayed to\nthe book in his film version starring\nBenicio del Toro and Johnny Depp, as\nRaoul Duke. But the book will take you\ndeeper down the clich\u00e9d, proverbial\nrabbit hole to Duke\u2019s very much un-cli-ched and unconventional experience of\nNevada in 1971. After reading you will\nonly want to explore Thompson\u2019s bibliography further, learning more of his\nwayward life that saw him living with\nthe Hell\u2019s Angels, running for Sheriff of\nAspen, campaigning for drug and firearm legalisation and rearing peacocks\nat his ranch, \u201cOwl Farm\u201d.\nA piccie from the film version. You COULD watch the film instead, but make sure you visualise all us arts\neditors looking over your shoulder and shaking our heads in disapproval while you\u2019re doing it. Tut tut.\nThe big man himself, Andy Warhol. Artistic genius or bit of a nutter?\nWhere conflict and culture meet\nRosie Milton nips over the road to the V&A for their current exhibition on Cold War design innovation\nT\nhe Cold War Modern:\nDesign 1945-1970 at the\nV&A Museum initially\npresented itself, with its\nintriguing and slightly\nawkward title, for its fusion of the political and economic state of conflict\nthat occurred in the 20th century between the Soviet Union and the United\nStates, and what may seem antitheti-cally, the applied arts of design. It immediately raised the question to me\n\u2013 what good could come out of such a\npolitically-tense time, with the threat of\ncatastrophe hanging over the heads of\nthe peoples of the west (and the east)?\nApparently, this era of competition encouraged a huge amount of innovation\nin design \u2013 from tea cups to telecommunication towers - this new spirit of\nthe age has also come to be known as\nthe \u2018space race\u2019. Both America and the\nSoviet Union were attempting to reach\nastronomical heights with skyscrapers\nand satellites, pushing to outdo each\nother with their \u2018homes of tomorrow\u2019.\nYet, only when we entered the first half\nof the exhibition to see propaganda\nposters, ominous building designs and\ntechnical innovations in weaponry, did\nwe begin to understand that we were\nwitnessing a paranoid age \u2013 where\nthe intentions of the superpowers had\ntrickled down into the everyday domestic lives of the masses.\nAs you walk through the exhibition,\nwhich is sensibly set out chronologi-cally, you are informed of the history of\nthe Cold War period through the leaps\nforward in design. From the unreal,\nsuch as Le Corbusier\u2019s visions of utopian architecture, to iconic pieces of\nfurniture, such as Eero Aarnio\u2019s Globe\nChair and films by Stanley Kubrick, we\ncan see just how influential this period\nwas and continues to be. Whilst touring this fascinating and informative exhibition we, as native Britons, considered political tensions today between\nthe powerful countries of the western\nworld. As I rubbed shoulders with a\nfew Russian and American visitors to\nthe exhibition, I wondered what their\nexperience of the design of the past\nwas and whether they thought it represented a positive movement out of the\nage of the cold war, or recognised that\nit only enhanced the fragility of our\nworld today.\nCold War Modern is on at the\nfabulous V&A right now, until 11\nJanuary 2009\nSuperman tried to keep it hidden that his twin brother was a commie, but failed.\n\n"

As usual\nHollywood doesn\u2019t disappoint; it\u2019s as\nsimple as \u2018You ask, We deliver\u2019... keep\nin mind though, that this works exclusively for orders of bad films. If you go\nto the pub, you know exactly what the\nfood will be like, you can bet your arm\non the taste of the microwaved vegeta-bles, fat-soaked chips and a piece of\nfish that the waiter assures you is indeed hidden somewhere under all that\nbatter. Of course sometimes there are\nexceptions but they simply prove the\nrule. By now I hope you all grasped\nthe metaphor - what I\u2019m trying to say\nis that if you decide to see an action\nthriller directed by a mediocre direc-tor, edited by a TV series editor with\nstandard, undistinguished (apart from\nBilly Bob Thornton) actors you should\nexpect a pub lunch.\nAlas, Eagle Eye with it\u2019s utterly implausible story of an intelligence gathering computer (named Aria) going\nrogue and deciding that the current\ngovernment violates the US Consitution and should hence be ousted by\nmeans of extermination is not even\nfast food. Whatever you say, even a Big\nMac menu will do what it\u2019s supposed\nto; it will fill you up, quench your thirst\nand better your mood. But this newest\n\u2018action thriller\u2019 does not thrill, does not\nexcite, does not grip and, most impor-tantly, does not entertain.\nThe movie starts off in an undisclosed\nlocationintheMiddleEastwhereapre-sumable terrorist is tracked down by\nthe US army. He is then killed in an air\nraid despite only a 51% chance of him\nbeing the correct person. Immediately\nafter that we are transported back to\nthe States where we are introduced to\nJonathan Shaw (Shia LaBoeuf), a rebellious clerk at a xerox-shop and Rachel\nHolloman (Michelle Monaghan), a sin-Films we love at Imperial\nSo here we are: you\u2019ve been sidetracked\nby watching Anchorman for the gazil-lionth time \u2013 \u201cHeck I\u2019m not mad, that\u2019s\namazing\u201d- and so you haven\u2019t had time\nto watch anything new. I\u2019ll give you the\nbenefit of the doubt, just this once.\nBut I am not writing this article to\ntalk to you about Anchorman, but\nabout how Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off is\nmy grande summer fling. Everything\nhe says is perfect and witty. In fact\nI could just quote him for the rest of\nthis article: \u201cI do have a test today. That\nwasn\u2019t bulls**t. It\u2019s on European social-ism. I mean, really, what\u2019s the point?\nI\u2019m not European. I don\u2019t plan on being European. So who cares if they\u2019re\nsocialists?\u201d But I won\u2019t.\nThe film is about Ferris Bueller, the\nmost popular guy in school, and everyone adores him. They think he\u2019s a\nrighteous dude. He pulls one last sickie\nbefore he graduates from high school\nand takes his girlfriend and best friend\nalong for the ride in a \u2018borrowed\u2019 vintage Ferrari: \u201cthe question isn\u2019t \u201cwhat\nare we going to do,\u201d the question is\n\u201cwhat aren\u2019t we going to do?\u201d\nIn one day they blag their way into\na snooty restaurant, take part in a parade (the best bit), visit an art museum\nand generally make mischief all over\nChicago. The acting is perfection, as\nMatthew Broderick (who plays Ferris)\nmakes the movie what it is, Charlie\nSheen is hilarious in a cameo perform-ance, and Jennifer Grey plays the evil\ntwin version of her Dirty Dancing-self\nas Ferris\u2019 stuck up sister. Also, the music is brilliant, no 80\u2019s power ballads\n(unlike The Breakfast Club), just funky\nbeats and old school tunes.\nFerris\u2019 motto is: \u201cLife goes by pretty\nfast. If you don\u2019t stop and look around\nonce in a while, you could miss it.\u201d It\nbecame my new mantra, and changed\nmy life. Even now when I have an\nhour to spare, instead of slobbing on\nfacebook seeing what other people\nare doing with their lives I try and do\nsomething \u2013 grab my friends, walk two\nminutes to the Science Museum and\ngo and play about in the exhibits \u2013 just\ndo anything! I don\u2019t have any time to\nspare!\nThe best thing about this movie is\nthat you join a club. You become one\nof Ferris\u2019 friends. I have never met anyone who didn\u2019t like this movie because\nit\u2019s about school and everyone has\nbeen there, stuck in a dull class losing\nyour will to live. Moreover it perfectly\ncaptures the sweet joy of rebelling\nagainst petty authority. Finally, the film\ncontinues all the way through the credits which just adds to it awesomeness\n\u2013 why don\u2019t more films do that?

(The Descent)\ngle over-protective mother dropping\nher son off at a train station. The opening scene is forgotten, ignored and\nclumsily and ineffectively tied to the\nplot at the end of the film, while our\ntwo conventional citizens rapidly and\ninevitably become action heroes when\nAria forces them to become pawns in\nher plan to kill the American presi-dent. Jonathan and Rachel must do as\nthey\u2019re told by the computer that can\ncontrol every automated machine, can\ntrack, activate and use any phone and\nuse high voltage cables to kill people.\nThe movie could have been saved\nif the story and characters had more\ndepth. In a well thought-out movie\nwhere every scene is not based on an\naction shot, the idea of an all-control-ling computer that gets out of hand\nwould have scared the hell out of us.\nThe film could have exploited a feeling of paranoia, could have explored\nthe interaction between two strangers\nthat are thrown together and obliged\nto pursue their own interests but work\nas a team, it could have included more\nthan one witty line, it could have minimized the gaping and garring plot holes\nand finally, it could have assumed the\naudience has a brain and some expectations and ended when the hero was\nstill dead. If Eagle Eye had fulfilled any\nof those \u2018could haves\u2019 it would have\nbeen a decent movie. But it\u2019s not, it\u2019s\nabysmal.\nNow to clarify the one-star rating. I\nconfess I gave this film that one single\nstar, which it doesn\u2019t deserve, because\nI was afraid that no one would be interested in reading a review of a movie\nthat scores 0/5.\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nComing soon:\nAlthough there have been plenty of comic book adaptations, the reason that this one stands out is because it is written and directed by Sin\nCity\u2019s Frank Miller, so looks set to be just as exciting and enthralling.\nStarring Gabriel Mach as The Spirit, a\nvengeful ghost who comes back from\nthe dead to fight crime and have tawdry relationships with a whole lot of\nwomen, this was originally a crime\nnoir comic strip in an American Sunday newspaper. With an all-star cast,\nincluding Hollywood favourite Samuel\nL. Jackson as the villain, Dr. Octopus,\nand featuring many beautiful screen sirens like Eva Mendes, Scarlett Johansson and Jamie King, to name just a few\nof the love interests, even if the film\ndoes not deliver to the same standard\nas Sin City, it should still be worth a\nwatch.\nA spirited cast bodes well for The Spirit\nI, science\nIssue 10 out next week\nGet your free copy with felix next Friday\nThe Imperial College science magazine\nTonight is Halloween night, so instead of leaving your house to pelt\ntrick or treaters with eggs, why not\nstay in with your friends, dim the\nlights, make a large bowl of popcorn\nand snuggle down on the sofa with\nsome scary films?\nWe all know that the world is a scary\nplace, but instead of being frightened\nby terrorists, the credit crunch and\nSarah Palin, we would recommend\nthat for just one night you should be\nafraid of something far worse: the\nhorror film.\nTo get you into the mood, here are\nFilm Felix\u2019s pick of the bunch, from\nthe good (some great horror delights),\nthe bad (avoid these at all cost), to the\nplain nasty. But as you begin to watch\nthese film just remember one thing:\nthere is someone in the house, and\nthey are watching you\u2026\nThe Good\nFriday the Thirteenth (1980)\nOne of the original slasher films, and\nin my opinion, the best. A group of\nteenagers working at an abandoned\nsummer camp are murdered one by\none, but does it have anything to do\nwith the poor child who drowned in\nthe lake years before? This is gory and\nsurprisingly scary, mainly because\nall of the teenagers (including Kevin\nBacon) are nice people who don\u2019t deserve their horrifying fates.\nIdentity (2003)\nTen people mysteriously bump into\neach other in a ransacked motel in\nthe middle of nowhere, before being\npicked off one by one. Sure it sound\nlike standard horror film-fare, but the\nfilm also provides lots of tension, as\nwell as original and gory deaths, and\nan all-star cast. The ending is also one\nof the best horror endings ever, and\njust goes to show that not everyone is\nafforded a second chance\u2026\nVacancy (2006)\nA bickering couple decide to stay in\na motel that is actually the setting\nfor snuff films, starring the unknowing customers. Clever directing and\nsolid performances make this chiller-thriller work.\nSnakes On A Plane (2007)\nA man in witness protection travels\non a plane to testify against a mob-ster, unaware that the mobster has\nstuffed the plane full of crazy snakes.\nIt may sound ridiculous, but this is so\nbad that it\u2019s good. If you want to see\npeople dying in extremely grisly ways\ninvolving frisky serpents, then this is\nthe film for you.\nThe Bad:\nHalloween (1978)\nA serial killer escapes from a mental\nhome and attacks young babysitters.\nAlthough this is often cited as one\nof the best horror films ever, it is terribly dated and does not scare in the\nway that it should. It is pretty tame for\nmodern standards; so don\u2019t expect to\nbe frightened.\nHarry Potter and the Order of the\nPhoenix (2007)\nNot a horror film you say? When you\ntake into account the shocking acting,\ndiabolically tedious plot, and horrifi-cally poor directing, then this all adds\nup to one thing: a horror. There are\nbetter things to spend your money\non, for example paying someone to\nre-enact the testicle-bludgeoning\nscene from \u2018Casino Royale\u2019. Trust me,\nif I had to choose between seeing this\nfilm again or having my balls crushed\nto a pulp, it would be an extremely\nhard decision.\n\t\t\t\nThe Fog (1980)\nYawn inducing terror about a group of\nrotting pirates that return 100 years\nafter being killed, shrouded in a neon\nfog. Yes, you read that correctly and\nyes, the film is rubbish.\nWhite Noise 2: The Light (2007)\nThis is so painfully awful and contrived that it actually hurts to think\nabout. The plot makes no sense and\nthe scares are turned into comedy because it is so shockingly bad.\nThe Nasty:\nThe Thing (1982)\nAlthough intensely gory, this film is\na brilliantly terrifying chiller that is\nboth unpredictable and unnerving.\nA group of scientists are stuck in an\nAntarctic outpost with an alien that\ncan imitate anything it wants to. Who\ndo you trust when the monster could\nbe anyone?\nThe Evil Dead (1981)\nA group of teenagers go to a cabin in\nthe woods and read a book that possesses them with demons. This film\nis not for the faint of heart, as it contains extreme splatter horror, including rolling heads, raping trees and\nscrewdrivers in ankles. Ouch.\nDawn of The Dead (1978)\nZombies have taken over the world\nand the only safe place to hide is a\nshopping mall. Shopping centre related deaths come thick and fast, e.g.\nriding in shopping carts wielding\na shovel in order to whack zombie\nheads off. The 2004 remake is good\ntoo.\nThe Descent (2005)\nA bunch of cave-exploring women are\ntrapped in a cavern filled with ravenous monsters. Will they escape? This\nEnglish horror film delivers in both\nshocks and gore, but if you really want\nto be scared make sure you watch the\nUK version for the creepy ending, not\nthe US one.\n\n"

Other\ngoals included a solidly taken short\ncorner drag flick from Ewan Quince\nand a nifty deflection on the post by\nPaul.\nLater in the half Diana scored a well\nplaced penalty flick after a lifted shot\nfrom Stumpy was denied on the line by\nsome admirably committed defending.\nFrom the picture it can clearly be seen\nthat the poor guy was in pain, but like I\nsaid, it did stop a goal.\nAt the end of an impressive first half\ndisplay the score was 6-0. In the second\nhalf UCL managed to recover some coordination in defence, however apart\nfrom a few minor counter attacks,\nUCL offered little offensive threat as\nthey played deep within their own half\nto relieve the pressure.\nSurprisingly the second half resulted\nin only two further goals from Imperial despite a good number of short\ncorners and shots.\nThe final score was a resounding\n8-0. The win means progression in the\nBUCS Cup and gives the team confidence heading into next weeks important league fixture against St Bart\u2019s\n1st XI, which promises to be a tough\nmatch.\nSachin was a clear man of the match,\ndemonstrating a killer finish on both\nthe forward and reverse sides that\nbodes well for the rest of the season.\nJack Cornish &\nMustapher Botchway\nSports Editors\nWelcome to another week of sports\nat Imperial. The new BUCS cup has\nstarted, now allowing most teams\nat Imperial to be able to experience\nthe rollercoaster ride of knock-out\ntournaments.\nHowever, there has been a mixed\nbag of results. Teams from hockey and\nrugby progressed, in addition to a good\nday for the footballers with the 2nd XI\novercoming a bad run of results with\na convincing win over Roehamtpton.\nMen\u2019s Badminton and the netballers\nwill want to quickly forget their cup\nlosses and concentrate on the league.\nfelix will be covering the BUCS cup\nmatches extensively in the coming\nweeks, so for those of you still in the\ncompetition, bring your A game, get\nthose wins and write some reports to\nus! The felix sports league table is being finalised as we speak, and will be\nready as soon as a few more BUCS\ngames have been played.\nFor those of you still looking for a\nsport and/or are unconvinced by getting up to play on Wednesdays, we\nhope this weeks reports from table\ntennis, ultimate frisbee and water polo\ncan whet your appetite and inform you\non the wide range of sports on offer by\nICU.\nThe ACC bar night on Wednesday was enjoyed by many teams and\ndemonstrated the \u201cwork hard, play\nhard\u2019 mentality for our sports teams.\nWith many clubs having a multitude\nof teams, ex-professionals right down\nto social players can experience the\ncamaraderie and the enjoyable atmosphere present in the union.\nHockey\nBUCS Cup\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XI 8\nUCL Men\u2019s 2nd XI 0\nRobin Willows\nWho said UCL didn\u2019t have balls\nHockey BUCS Cup 1st round\nImperial College Hockey Club continue their good form, see page 39\n\n"

I know\nit\u2019 no excuse, but as the\ndeadline crept ever for-ward, I found my self too involved with\nother events. I can\u2019t guarantee this\nwon\u2019t happen again. Ahwell.\nWell, as things settle down in college,\nand people start working hard, I would\nlike to point out that you will need to\ntake a break from work in the foreseeable future. I do this all the time, so it\nmust be fine. Last night I went to Fabric, It was awesome. On tuesday I went\nto a civilised boat party. It\u2019s the little\nbreaks that help you get through Imperial College.\nNow for a rant. Not enough of the\nfreshers make an effort!. Beit had a\nhalloween party the other day, and\non general the costumes were above\naverage. However there wasn\u2019t one\ncostume that was spectacular. I\u2019d admit i thought the two guys who came\na priest and his child rape victim was\npretty funny, but nothing amazing.\nEven one of the sub wardens came as\nthe terminator (with half his face blown\noff) and looked freaking sweet. So why\nthen can\u2019t the freshers pick up the ball?\nAnother case was the ABC party. ABC\nmeans anything but clothes... why did\ncome people turn up in jeans or a Tshirt? I do think more should be done\nto impress. I know we are all students\nwith low incomes, but all you need is a\ncreative mind, bin liners, tinfoil, duck\ntape and a small aubergine.\nIn other news, the FUCKWIT League\nhas expanded due to an executive deci-sion. Not only does it include the photoshop competition, but the slitherlink,\nwordoku, crossword and double points\nfor the cryptic crossword. So Start entering multiple puzzle entries, the first\nentry we receive will get 5 points, 4 the\nthe next, 3 after that etc. Take a look\nat the league table to see how your do-ing, and how close you are to winning\nthat iPod.\nThis week Snaky B is dressed up a Osama Bin Laden. A Controversial issue?\nI think not. And well done to whoever\nphotoshoped the image. Classic! There\nhave been requests from withing the\nfelix office, for Snaky B to bring out\na single. I personally think it will be\nnumber one in Top of the Pops. We\u2019ve\nalso got a feature article about a new\nbrand of sandwich\u2019s found in the JCR.\nFor the record, this is not photoshoped,\nbut is extremely fake. They were real\nsnacks that were horrifically altered\nwith the use of an incredible Sharpies\nmarker. On another note, was anyone\nat the careers fair on wednesday? If you\nwere please email in any pictures you\nmay have of the crazy hippie guy on\nguitar. Thanks.\n6. Dads Music:\nEveryone at Imperial College loves\nthe music their parents listen too.\nNow they may not be willing to admit\nit, thinking they might loose the little bit of street cred left, but it\u2019s true.\nYou may be saying no now, but go\nto cheapskates, or the union and 10\npints later Brian Adams is on. Everyone is shouting the lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody. Obviously not to Brian\nAdams. That would be foolish.\nClassics include:\nQueen\nDavid Bowie\nBrian Adams\nJimmy Hendrix\nThin Lizzy\nBlack Sabbath\nEurope\nBlur\nEurythmics\nNeil Young\nBlue osyter cult\nAnd many mnore that won\u2019t fit into\nthis box. Go ask your dad.\nCoffee Break\n34 felix Friday 31 October 2008\nThis weeks winner. Team rapid bunnyz Next weeks RAW image for you to go wild. See www.felixonline.co.uk\nCongratulations to this week\u2019s win-ner, Team Rapid Bunnyz. I personally\nlove the tag line (which is most likely\nnot clear enough to read at this size).\nIt reads \u201cDelivering Coffee to a union\nnear you.\u201d Great stuff. The felix office\nwas extremely pleased to see the cast\nfrom aquateen hunger force muscle in\non the tiny coffee cart.

This\nDrink with me, I\u2019m Snaky B\nand this week I\u2019m dressed as Osama B\nweek\u2019s image is from the carrers fair.\nIt\u2019s from the philips stall, and the picture currently reads \u201cgive a new twist\nto her life\u201d which we think is hilarious.\nOn another note, what is this guy doing in the picture?\nThe high res picture can be found\nonline. Click on Coffee Break in the\nsections tab. Email your entry to cof-fee.felix@imperial.ac.uk with your\nteam name and .PSD file and you\u2019ll be\nentered into the FUCWIT league.\nD\neath to the infidels. I\nSnaky B am the great\nOsama B, and with my\nmighty terroist cell of\ncider and larger we will\ndestroy the bitter and soft drinks of the\nwestunionbars.Iamsoconfidentinmy\nterrorist abilities I wear live grenades\nas a vest, and carry and AK 47 with one\nhand.. Seriously all the other terrorists\nare wimps, they all have dummy gre-nades. They all say \u201coh but if I get hit\nby an bullet i\u2019ll blow up\u201d or \u201cthe AK has\ntoo much recoil, I dislocated my shoulder one time.\u201d They should be ashamed\nto call themselves terrorists. What do\nthey do? Nothing. I, however, took out\nthe American economy.. Wait too far?\nSorry, i\u2019m realy only a pint of snake\nbite. My appologies, have a snake bite\nnext time you in the union. Tell them\nSnaky B sent you. They\u2019ll know what\nyour on about. Well i\u2019m off to hide in a\ncave with my dialysis machine. see you\nlater you western scum.\nMy mother is starting to think I dress\nup every day now. Not cool. What will\nI be dressed as next week? Pick up the\nnext issue of felix to see.\nCarlos Santana who? Dad I don\u2019t like your music. I\u2019ve told you before.\n35\nFriday 31 October 2008 felix\nVirgo\nWhat is with those\ndamn long hairs,\nalways inflicting\ntheir misguided\ncommie ideals on\nthe poor student\npopulation. They should learn that greed is\ngood, fast cars are awesome and that breathing\nin coal dust is good for the lungs. I hope that\nthey take their organic hemp fibre ropes, find\nan old English oak in an ancient wood and\nhang themselves from the highest branch.\nScorpio\nThis week you\nrealise that felix\nhoroscopes are\nprobably not\nwritten by anyone\nwith knowledge of\nastrology or with any skills as a medium. This\nis a crashing blow, especially because you\u2019ve\nbeen following their advice religiously for the\npast three years.\nLibra\nThis week computer\nglitches will\nconspire against\nyou downloading\nthe latest Serbian\ndonkey porn. Maybe\nour dear editor will have to rely on more\narchaic forms of entertainment to exercise his\nwrist, perhaps even his imagination. Rumour\nsuggests that he may have quite a depraved\none.\nSagittarius\nThis week you were\nlate finishing your\nfelix pages because\nyou were distracted\nby a poster about\npigs and goats.\nSeriously, I think this place needs some new\nposters, nice to see those lovely naked hockey\nladies still have pride of place. The flyer inviting us to hold our Christmas dinner at the\nJury\u2019s Inn must be out of date, I\u2019m pretty sure\nthe football club got us all banned from there.\nCapricorn\nThis week it\nbecomes apparent\nthat having facial\nhair just wasn\u2019t\nmeant for you.\nNo one has quite\nplucked up the courage to say it to your face\nyet, that will happen on Tuesday. On Saturday,\nyou will shave, and will realise you now have a\nreally unfortunate tan-line where your beard\nonce was.\nCancer\nThis week you\nwill continue to\nannoy, irritate and\ngenerally upset\nyour siblings.\nIf the fact that\nyou are a constantly nagging thorn in the\nside of your close family comes as a shock\nand upsets you then I suggest that you stop\nbeing so opinionated, dull and annoying. Or,\nalternatively, ignore everything that I\u2019ve said.\nGemini\nThis week it has\nbeen decided by the\ngovernment to strip\nall Gemini of their\nsaving accounts in\norder to help those\npeople born at other times of the year whose\nneeds are more worthwhile. If you wish to\navoid this unwarranted, prejudicial taxation\nthen the best advice is to hide all of your\nmoney under your pillow, you miserable old\ntight arse.\nLeo\nThis week you\nshould strive to be\nless shy and stop\nhiding yourself away.\nPeople are more\nunderstanding than\nyou may think and may not be put off by that\nhideous facial disfigurement of yours, after all\nthere are much worse examples available to all\nand sundry on the web. Who knows, you may\neven meet a lovely blind person.\nTaurus\nSeriously, are\nyou that bored in\nlectures that you\nhave to entertain\nyourself by reading\nthis drivel. I suggest\nthat you find a better way to pass the time,\nmaybe by not attending lectures at all and\ndownloading illegal movies off the tinterweb.\n(felix does not condone missing lwectures or\nthe illegal downloading of copyright material)\nAries\nThis week the after\neffects of the ACC\nbar night continue\nto haunt you. Not\nonly were you left\nwith an infernal\nhangover but you will be constantly reminded\nof the humiliation of your drunken antics and\nsexual advances. Just one piece of advice, you\nhad better get checked out down at the clinic,\nyou filthy pervert.\nPisces\nThis week an\nargument will\nrage as to what\nare the melodic\naccompaniments\nbest suited to a\nworking environment. The heavens dictate\nthat there is only one form on music worth\nlistening to, the power ballad. So settle down\nat your desk and get to work while bathed in\nthe sweet sounds of Boston\u2019s More Than a\nFeeling.\nHoroscopes: prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Russel Grant edition\nAquarius\nThis week you wonder whether going\nto the careers fair\nhad any purpose, as\nthe current financial\nclimate seems to be\nagainst any chance of you gaining meaningful\nemployment. Fear not, it is written in the stars\nthat you will find work, under the tutelage of\nRonald Macdonald flipping burgers beneath\nthe golden arches.\nGuest writer Tarquin Quimbiff brings his own unique style to the horoscopes. Enjoy!\nWhere is my dialysis machine?\nJegg Donner\nCoffee Break Field Reporter\nJCR offers new delights\nThink you\u2019re eating healthy? Try Danger Cranks!\nHave you been feeling down lately?\nNeed an extra boost in that miserable existence of yours? Perhaps you\njust want more protein in your diet?\nRead no further. Our Coffee Break\nteam in the field have found the cure\nto all these problems, as well as some\nothers. That\u2019s right we even found the\ncure to herpes. Here\u2019s a clue, it\u2019s not\npro plus mixed with relentless. It\nis a brand new\nsuper sandwich called\n\u201cDanger\nCranks.\u201d If\nyou didn\u2019t\nguess it 15 seconds ago then you\u2019re\nan idiot. It\u2019s in the subtitle and the\npicture.\nAlready at a JCR near you, Danger\nCranks is the curb stomp you\u2019ve all\nbeen waiting for. Full of all that good\ngrade E meat, vomit, last years salad\nand secret special sauce (A.K.A se-men). When asked, the head of VegSoc (we won\u2019t name him here because\nwe don\u2019t know his name and are too\nlazy to look it up) expressed his interest in the miracle product, stating \u201cI\ndo love me a bit of Danger Crank.\u201d\nFor all of you who don\u2019t know\nwhat a crank is; it\u2019s a combination\nof crying and wanking.\nCouple this with a little risk\nand you have the fabled Danger\nCrank. This is where you call for your\nmother and try to finish making semen\nsalad before she walks in. Incidently Semen Salad is a vegetarian dish made by\nthe same company as Danger Cranks.\nWe don\u2019t know how much a Danger\nCranks sandwich is but we did hear\nfrom a reliable source that you don\u2019t\nhave to pay, you just kiss the cashier.\nSomeone else told us you had to be\ncircumcised, the catch here is it has to\nbe performed Jov. I\u2019ll be honest, I just\ndon\u2019t know.\nWith the hit success of the Danger\nCranks brand, Danger Cranks PLC has\ngiven us exclusive rights to inform you\nabout their upcoming products, Rainbow Shakes and Chocolate Starfish.\nWe\u2019re sold already.\nFUCWIT\nLeague Table\nI had 2 of these this morning.

Since starting at ICSM,\nI have immersed myself in Medical\nSchool life as much as possible by being involved in the Football Club and\nDrama Society, as well as helping to organise events such as the Halfway Dinner and RAG Fashion Show. My role\non the Students\u2019 Union this year has\nbrought me into regular contact with\nICSM students both young and old,\nand I feel I am now perfectly placed to\nmake your views heard at Union Council. I will do everything in my power to\nensure that ICSM students are given\na strong voice and that you all benefit\nas much as possible when important\ndecisions are being made. Vote for me\nand I will take care of the rest.\nUndergraduate Councillors\nThe ICU council makes decisions on a\nwide range of issues, everything from\nNUS membership to campus re-de-velopment, and all of these decisions\naffect us as medical students. Therefore it is hugely important that we are\nstrongly represented as medical students on the council, to make sure that\nour voice is heard! For the last three\nyears at medical school, I have been\nactively involved in clubs and societies,\nbeing in ICSM netball club and backstage manager of light opera society.\nIf elected, my aim would be to listen\nto all the diverse views of members\nof our medical school to ensure that I\nwas representing what people want at\nICU council meetings. I am passionate about ICSM maintaining a strong\npresence within IC, so please vote for\nme and I will do my best to ensure that\nyou are represented well.

In fact, I\u2019m guessing\nyou\u2019re only on this page because you\nwant your favourite club or society to\nhave an extra bit of dosh. But there\nis an awful lot the Union can do, and\nit does achieve things for us Medics.\nAnd I feel it\u2019s important that we have\nfull and proper representation on the\nmain body of the Union; we make up\na pretty big proportion of the College\npopulation and we ought to have an\nequally loud voice. I have been actively\ninvolved with many clubs and societies\nduring my time here. I occasionally\nwrite for Felix and currently, I am the\nTreasurer for EMSA and I manage the\nwebsite for MedSin. So, vote for me if\nyou want an honest and solid person to\nrepresent your concerns and opinions\nto those crazy guild hacks!\nStanding for IC Council feels like a\nnatural step for me. I\u2019ve been active in\nlocal and national politics since I started Imperial 4 years ago. I\u2019m currently\nVice President of ICSMSU and have\nheld the position of ICSM\u2019s BMA rep\nfor the last 2 years.\nI intend to use my capacity on the\ncouncil to represents your views honestly and transparently. It\u2019s important\nfor us to be pro-active and to not allow\napathy to dictate the tone of student\npolitics. I believe strongly in medical\neducation and good education at that.\nI co-edited and co-founded the foundation school guide \u2018Quack\u2019 which has\nbeen delivered nationally to all final\nyear medical students for the past 2\nyears.\nA vote for me is a vote for a hard\nworking, politically-minded and honest candidate, who believes strongly in\nstudents and student activity.\nRhys Morgan\nNo manifesto was submitted.\nS\ncience\nHi everyone, my name is Nida and I\nhope these are good enough reasons for\nvoting for me this year: I talk... a lot - so\nif you want someone to kick up a fuss\nabout issues we students feel are important I\u2019m a pretty good choice for getting\nthe guys that call the shots listening. I\u2019m\nactive - being involved in many societies\nincluding debatesoc, and am currently\nvice president of ISoc - coordinating\nevents and taking part in different fund\nraising schemes around university (and\nyou know I\u2019ve got to be organised to fit\nall that in around the insane amount of\nwork we get set) But most importantly\nI\u2019m an Imperial student - I visit the same\ncampus (campuses... campii?), use the\nsame facilities and union as you guys -and will take a position on council seriously to ensure college policy always\nprioritises its students.\n\u2018Democracy is the only system that\npersists in asking the powers that be\nwhether they are the powers that ought\nto be\u2019 - Sydney J.

    "content": "A\npivotal moment is before us. Amidst an ever-growing economic crisis\nof proportions unprecedented in the last few\ndecades, the world turns its somewhat\noverly judgmental eye to what is arguably the most media-intensive American election of all time. The key word\nhere is American. Senator McCain\u2019s\ncampaign prioritises America; the effort to fix the country and revitalise its\ncitizens takes precedence above all other issues. His entire campaign is based\non \u201ccountry first\u201d. Country is used here\nas a collective noun to describe the 300\nmillion hard working, loyal and patriot\npeople from all walks of life who make\nup the United States of America.\nHe is an earnest character that tends\nto avoid monumental amounts of\nrhetoric. He gives his political record\na chance to be voiced through the\nmouthpiece of not only his core supporters but those countless converted\nDemocrats and previously undecided\nvoters. This mouthpiece, however,\nis certainly not the country\u2019s media.\nNotably, the New York Times and the\nWashington Post have thrown their\nincredible weight behind the Illinois\nsenator. Two of the most widely read\nnewspapers in the country continue to\nconjure up pieces with an Obama bias\nin an attempt to disintegrate and discredit the McCain campaign. Obama\npropaganda has become ubiquitous\nand several other media sources have\njumped on his bandwagon. It is an\nunashamed attempt to fabricate a self-fulfilling prophecy. While polls currently show Obama ahead, the rather\nerratic spread is suffering a crunch\nat this very moment. The election is\nanything but lost for Senator McCain.\nObama on the other hand is trying to\nclinch a victory by riding this platform\nconstructed from an overeager media\nwith a clearly liberal agenda who keep\non making the crucial editorial mistake of assuming audiences are not intelligent or informed enough to make\ndecisions.\nJohn McCain is running a campaign\nthat is less focused on increasing exposure in the media and more concerned with tackling the cancerous\nlack of confidence in the American\npolitical system. By contrast, Obama\nhas been injecting record amounts of\ncash into making sure he is seen and\nheard whenever a television is turned\non. McCain sees no need for omnipresence and the incessant flooding of\nairwaves to bully voters. Obama claims\nMcCain\nSenator John McCain\nWhat are McCain\u2019s policies?\nIn the words of the senior senator from\nArizona, \u2018education is the civil rights\nissue of the 21st Century\u2019. While the\ncandidates\u2019 education policies tend to\nbe almost completely ignored by those\nof us outside the United States, the education issue is a crucially important\none for Americans.\nMcCain\u2019s emphasis in his campaign\nhas always been on widening the choice\nof schools on offer, allowing students\nand parents to choose schools that offer the best experience for children.\nOn the controversial issue of the No\nChild Left Behind (NCLB) act, McCain has advocated improvement of\nthe way the act is implemented rather\nthan outright discarding of it.\nMcCain shares his rival\u2019s views on\nuniversal preschool and on offering\nhigher wages to teachers, but offers a\nrange of unique proposals of his own.\nThe most striking of these is an emphasis on \u2018virtual classrooms\u2019, a plan\nwhereby some $ 500 million is invested\nin virtual teaching programmes.\nEducation Economy Healthcare Foreign Affairs\nMcCain\u2019s grasp of the economy has\nundoubtedly been the chink in his\narmour this time around. Ill-advised\ninformal comments about his own difficulties with economic complexities,\ncombined with the intricate footwork\nnecessary to explain the recent credit\ncrunch, have to some extent reduced\npublic confidence.\nHis plans, however, have the support\nof a wide range of economists. Among\nhis key promises is to have the budget\nbalanced by the end of his first year in\noffice, lower the corporate tax rate by\n10% and eliminate tax loopholes costing the taxpayer $45 billion a year.\nMcCain has also committed himself\nto improving America\u2019s foreign trade\nagreements. By lowering barriers to\ntrade and improving the North American Free Trade Agreement, the American economy should be on an equal\nfooting internationally.\nThe tax credits McCain is proposing\nare mainly dedicated to making healthcare and education more affordable.\nSenators McCain and Obama have\nboth invested a great deal of time and\neffort in their plans for a major reform\nof the American healthcare system.\nWhereas his Democratic rival is\npushing for a single health insurance\nprovider run and controlled by the\ngovernment, McCain believes in being\nable to make a free choice between a\ncompeting set of alternatives.\nThe crux of his proposed reform is\noffering each individual a $2,500 tax\ncredit which can be spent on health insurance in whichever way they choose.\nAll of McCain\u2019s policies on the issue\nof healthcare revolve around the four\nbasic pillars of his campaign: \u2018affordability, access and choice, portability\nand security, and quality\u2019. By maintaining competitive pricing on insurance\noffers, making it easier for families to\nobtain an insurance policy and emphasising the role individual states play in\nproviding healthcare, McCain hopes to\nachieve these most fundamental of his\ngoals.\nWhat started off as McCain\u2019s strongest suit has been slowly slipping away\nfrom him as Obama and Biden have\nmanaged to put together a coherent\nforeign policy of their own.\nThe issue that matters most to non-Americans is how American diplomacy is handled \u2013 and in the experienced\nstatesman that is John McCain there is\nless cause to worry.\nWhile McCain\u2019s seeming militarism\nhas provided some with cause to worry,\nhisrecordsuggestsarational,peaceable\noutlook deeply rooted in pragmatism.\nThe difference between Obama and\nMcCain that has received most airtime\nabroad is that between their positions\non Iraq. While Obama is keen to have\nstrict deadlines for troop pullout, McCain eschews timeplans, believing that\nthe soldiers should leave when the job\nhas been done.\nWhen it comes to opposing Russia\u2019s\nrecent actions, supporting Israel and\nworking to improve relations abroad,\nboth candidates have similar policies.\nto care about the American people,\nbut by spending over $6 million on two\nadverts alone, Obama is in fact doing\nsomething not dissimilar from what he\nhas cursed investment banks for doing;\nleveraging monetary power for undue\ninfluence. By buying the American\nvote, he is in fact setting an unfortunate precedent for future elections and\ndamaging American democracy for\nyears to come.\nSenator McCain is keenly aware that\ngovernment has the power to influence change in the nation but he, unlike Obama, knows that it lacks the\nefficiency and proper motivation to be\ntruly productive. The free market really has the power to create new jobs\nand wealth and to effect change in\nthe way the people deserve. McCain\nbelieves in top-down economics \u2013 a\nsystem where change implemented at\nthe peak of the pyramid will trickle\ndown into society as a whole: and the\nrecord of American capitalism is on his\nside. As a result, McCain has pledged\nto cut taxes for large corporations, to\nfuel their growth again as well as deter\ncompanies from seeking complicated\nand expensive tax loopholes. Obama\nwants, in his own words, to \u201cspread the\nwealth\u201d \u2013 an idea that contradicts the\nAmerican value system of individual\nendeavour. McCain understands that\nchange actually comes in the form of\nwell-thought-out fiscal policies rather\nthan overly utopian dreams of supposed uniformity and redistributive\ntax ideas. His fiscal policy is unerring\nand poses no moral dilemma for the\nAmerican people who rightly struggle\nwith the socialism Obama is bouncing\naround. His concepts of redistribution\nare inherently un-American, against its\nfounding principles and have no place\nin the United States.\nSenator McCain is pledging $5,000\nto each family to help offset the costs of\nhealth care. This is the perfect way to\ngive millions of Americans the choice\nof a plan that suits them, and not one\ngeneric one the government unscien-tifically deems suitable for an entire\npopulation. This monetary incentive\nalso helps to reduce the acknowledged\nand disturbing disparity between those\nwho are wealthy enough to purchase\nhealth insurance policies and those\nwho unfortunately do without. Obama\nwants to nationalise this service, unwilling to admit that the humongous\nbureaucratic task that it entails will\ndoom his efforts to failure.\nIt has been proven in countries with\ncentralised health services that seemingly simple tasks like replacing computer systems can take upwards of five\nyears. McCain\u2019s health care reform is\npragmatic and clever and does not endanger Americans should a misguided\nattempt at centralisation fail. He is\nliving up to everything that America\nshould be and has always tried to be:\nfree and efficient. More importantly,\nwhile Obama is squeezing a nation by\noffering no choice, McCain is giving\ncitizens the freedom to choose and is\nenforcing the country\u2019s democratic\nvalues.\nFollowing the Democratic National\nConvention this September it is absolutely clear that Mr Obama has created\nand is leading a movement that seems\nmore concerned with conforming to\nwhat can almost be described as a \u2018religion of Obama\u2019. This is evidenced not\nonly by the sheer number of gatherers\nat the stadium, but its conversion by\nthe campaign into a temple, complete\nwith erected temple-like columns right\nin the centre. It shows an egotistic\nand arrogant candidate who clearly\nbelieves his own media hype. Senator McCain is deeply engaged with\nhis supporters because they listen to\nhim, unlike Obama\u2019s who blindly follow \u2018The One\u2019. They question his ideas\nand a symbiotic relationship between\nhim and America was formed and it\nprevails today. There is no sense of\nsuperiority on either part. Rather, he\nempathises with the American people\nand there is a sense of connection to\nthem and their troubles. It is grounded\nin reality rather than the perceived and\nartificial needs of the country. With\nSenator McCain, voters can be sure\nthey are attached to a person and not a\nmachine manufacturing verbose statements with little content.\nApart from being more politically\nstable and better equipped to implement change, John McCain is quite\nclearly the more experienced candidate\nfor the post of Commander-in-Chief\nof the United States. Barack Obama\nis still too green and inexperienced\nfor the top job, having spent his entire\ntime in elected office voting \u2018Present\u2019.\nMcCain\u2019s experience is absolutely\nunparalleled and his commitment\nunquestionable as he has been serving the country for almost 43 years, 5\nand half of those as a prisoner of war.\nThe slogan \u2018Country first\u2019 predates his\ncampaign, he has time and time again\nput his own reputation and safety\nsecond, for his country; his service in\nVietnam is ample proof of this. After\nhis plane was shot down and he was\ncaptured and tortured, he stayed true\nto his values and loyal to his country.\nThis is who John McCain is: an incredibly driven hero who understands the\nimportance of staying true to himself,\nnobody could doubt his resilience as\nan American commander. What Senator Obama fails to realise is that McCain did not vote for the war in Iraq\nlightly or merely to tick a box for party\napproval. That idea, shared by a large\nmajority of Democrats, makes an absolute mockery of the Senator and anyone who has bravely given their life in\nthe fight to keep America and Americans free and safe from external abuse.\nAnyone who has experienced the true\nhorrors of war and seen the ghastly\nsights that McCain has would not dare\nsuggest that war is the best solution to\na problem unless there was a real need\nfor it. His foreign policy credentials\nstack up and he needs not rely on his\nrunning mate, unlike Barack Obama,\nfor what really should be the Head of\nState\u2019s eminent attribute.\nAmerica is on the cusp of a metaphorical nervous breakdown. Atop this\nhighly unstable foundation, McCain\nhas the inherent moral authority to be\nbold. His aim is not, like Obama, to be a\ncrowd pleaser and embrace the policies\nof failure. The Senator from Arizona is\nunafraid to take views that could actually benefit America but members of\nhis party may find \u2018un-Republican\u2019. He\nhas what Andy Card has called the very\nnoble \u201ccourage to be lonely\u201d. Like the\nFounding Father George Washington,\nhe is a visionary and a defender of Democracy. Above everything, he is not\nscared of sacrificing himself as he has\ndone many times in the past, to ensure\nthe continuity of the United States as\nthe world\u2019s super power in a prosperous and peaceful fashion.\nEarly Life\nJohn McCain was born August\n29th, 1936 in the Coco Solo\nNaval Air Station in Panama\nto Roberta Wright McCain and\nJohn S. McCain Jr, a four star\nadmiral in the United States\nNavy who served his country\nfor three decades.\nDuring childhood his\nnicknames included \u2018Jonny\u2019,\n\u2018Punk\u2019 and \u2018McNasty\u2019. He then\nventured to Annapolis to begin\nhis higher education studies\nat the United States Naval\nAcademy, proudly graduating\nin 1958.\nPolitical Career\n2008 Campaign\nMcCain began his fully-fledged career in politics in\n1987 becoming the Senator\nfor the state of Arizona where\nhe gained a reputation for\ndistancing himself from the\nparty when he felt necessary.\nIn 1999 the Senator\nannounced he was running for\nPresident in the 2000 election\nbut ended up losing the\nnomination to George W. Bush\nmostly because of his inability\nto mobilise Evangelical voters.\nMcCain returned to the Senate\nin 2001.\nIn April 2007, McCain officially\nannounced he was running for\nthe Presidency in Portsmouth,\nNew Hampshire where he\nfamously stated he was not\nrunning \u201cto be somebody, but\nto do something\u201d.\nWhile he initially trailed\nformer NYC Mayor Rudy\nGiuliani, he eventually won the\nnomination.\nMcCain surprised the\nnation when in late August\nhe annouced Sarah Palin, the\ngovernor of the state of Alaska,\nas his running mate: a decision\nthat aroused controversy.\n\n"

    "content": "O\nne week away from\nchange in America.\nThat is the message\nof Senator Barack\nObama\u2018s speech to the\nAmerican people on October 27th\nin Canton, Ohio. As you are reading\nthese words, it might be that change is\ndays or hours away; change may even\nhave washed over you already. We all\nknow that America stands on a preci-pice, an Asian century looms large and\nthe Capitalist, Democratic American\nSenator Barack Obama\nway is more discredited than at any\nother time in its history. The election of the first black President of the\nUnited States would not be evidence of\nvoters with a racial agenda; instead it is\nthe symbolic gesture of a country taking strides into an uncertain American\ncentury and the trumpet call of a nation ready to lead the world once again.\nThis is the case for Barack Obama.\nThe financial philosophy of Reagan\nand Thatcher has crumbled, U.S. influence is weak and Iraq and Afghanistan\ncontinue to strain the nation\u2019s military.\nThese are the times in which a New\nYork Times poll showed that 89% of\nAmericans believe the country is heading in the wrong direction. Barack\nObama is the man who will take the\nU.S. in the right direction. His person-ality, his politics and his policies show\nthat he is a man who understands the\nchallenges American faces and who\nknows how to overcome them.\nWhile John McCain has behaved erratically during the ongoing economic\ncrisis, Barack Obama has shown the\nstrength of his character. He is careful\nin speech and reasoned in thought but\nalso steadfast and unafraid to act when\nneccessary. At the Presidential debates\nit was clear that Barack Obama was\nin control, mentally, of the difficulties\nfacing the nation. His competency and\nseriousness is a refreshing change to\nthe cowboy President of the last 8 years\nand a stark contrast to the shallow,\ngimmick-driven McCain campaign.\nObama\u2019s choice of running mate, unlike McCain\u2019s, exemplifies his commitment to be a responsible steward of the\nUnited States. He made a decision that\nreflects an understanding of his own\nweaknesses and an unwillingness to\nplay campaign politics with important\nPresidential decisions. Senator Joseph\nBiden is a man with impeccable foreign\npolicy credentials, which combined\nwith Obama\u2019s unique world view mean\nthat an Obama-Biden victory will,\ncontrary to Republican attacks, leave\nAmerica in safe hands internationally.\nWhat are Obama\u2019s policies?\nThat is his personality, but his politics also inspire confidence. In his\nfrenzied scramble to make any attack\nstick on Obama, John McCain has finally resorted to calling him a socialist.\nHenrik Hertzberg of the New Yorker\nMagazine summed up, \u201cBarack Obama\nhad already been accused of betraying\nthe troops, wanting to teach kinder-gartners all about sex, favoring infan-ticide, and being a friend of terrorists\nand terrorism. What was left?\u2026\u201d. The\nslanders of the Republican campaign\nare not working: not because they are\nuntrue, as John Kerry knows all too\nwell, but because Obama has succeeded in presenting an effective plan of action to deal with America\u2019s problems.\nThis is not a plan that is based in exhausted ideological politics, like John\nMcCain\u2019s: but rather an evidence-driv-en, pragmatic minded and bold plan.\nJohn McCain describes himself as a\nmaverick, but it is Barack Obama who\nhas taken a bold policy path. He promises to destroy terrorism at its home in\nthe border region of Afghanistan and\nPakistan, not because he is ignorant of\nthe costs of war but because he knows\nthat if he doesn\u2019t, America will not be\nsafe. He promises to direct negotiations\nwith the nation\u2019s most reviled enemies,\nnot because he is ignorant about the\nmoral character of those regimes but\nbecause he knows that America can no\nlonger protect its interests without direct diplomacy. He knows that raising\ntaxes on the wealthiest minority of U.S.\ncitizens will not win him votes amongst\n\u2018socialist\u2019 fearing Republicans but he\nalso knows that the economy will not\ngrow unless the the population is given\na tax-break. Obama is unafraid to risk\nhis popularity on important issues, he\nis mentally flexible and responsive to\nevidence based politics; unlike John\nMcCain he has put ideology second\nand country first.\nA President\u2019s personality and politics\nare of the utmost importance. They let\nus know how they will behave in office but ultimately American voters are\nmaking their decision based on each\ncandidate\u2019s policies on the issues facing them today. Barack Obama might\nhave been a style candidate, a charismatic lightweight with little more to\noffer than a wink and a smile. However\nObama\u2019s policies are proof that he is a\nsubstance politician; they are proof of\nhis readiness to be President\nThe economy is the most important\nissue of this election and Obama is the\ncandidate who will help American citizens through this difficult time. Barack\nObama\u2019s tax plans ensure that the lower\nand middle class of American receive\nthe help that they need. His tax-pro-posals reduce the tax-burden on 95%\nof American citizens at a time when\nAmericans are having to tighten their\nbelts. Unlike John McCain, who believes that only tax-cuts to large corporations can help the economy, Obama\u2019s\ntax-proposals are aimed at ordinary\nworking Americans and small American businesses. Instead of tax-cuts for\nlarge corporations, Obama will eliminate capital gains taxes for small business and provides a 50% tax credit to\nhelp small business provide healthcare\ninsurance for the employees. Obama is\nnot the candidate who will raise tax-es, indeed Americans earning under\n$250,000 a year, the vast majority, will\nnot see any tax increases.\nThe U.S. healthcare system loses billions each year through inefficiency\nand poor patient care. Obama\u2019s healthcare proposals will update the U.S.\nhealthcare system, reduce costs and\nensure coverage for all U.S. citizens.\nHe will drive forward the adoption\nof the electronic storage of medical\nrecords, a move that could save up to\n$77 billion year through increased ef-ficiency. The strain is felt, not only on\nthe healthcare system, but by ordinary\nAmericans who have seen their insurance premiums rocket 87% in the last\n6 years; those lucky enough to afford\nhealthcare coverage. Rather than socializing healthcare, Obama\u2019s proposals increase competition by allowing\nconsumers to import safe, cheaper\ndrugs from other countries and letting\nMedicare negotiate directly with drug\ncompaniesforcheaperdrugprices.The\ncenterpiece of his healthcare reform is\nensuring universal insurance coverage in America. This will provide all\nAmericans with affordable and easily\naccessible health care and ensure that\nregardless of wealth, no American citizen will ever again be forced to choose\nbetween bankruptcy and treatment.\nThese are but two aspects of Obama\u2019s\ncomprehensive vision. The election\ncomes down to a choice; a team with a\n(good) plan and a team without a clue\nabout what the next 4 years might look\nlike. John McCain scarcely knows how\nmany houses he owns never mind what\nto do to combat the economic crisis.\nHis campaign is coming apart under\nthe pressure of its own contradictions,\nshortcomings and failures. The message from John McCain is that he preside over another 4 years of direction-less politics with a Vice-President who\ndashes the hopes of all rational-minded\nhumans; that after George W. Bush, we\nwouldn\u2019t have another utterly unqualified person in the White House. John\nMcCain can label himself a maverick\nbut in important areas, such as tax\npolicy, healthcare and the economy,\nhe remains anchored to the intellectually bankrupt politics of the Reaganist\nRepublican Party. He has to resort to\nempty attacks on the character of his\nopponent because the right has nothing left in the tank, no new ideas.\nThe right will ultimately blame the\n\u2018elitist media\u2019 for a supposed unflinching bias in favour of Barack Obama\nbut in truth the 2008 election is about\ntiming. Both John McCain and Barack\nObama are public servants of the highest standard, but it is Obama who has\nthe mental flexibility, intellectual curiosity and firm but calm leadership\nappropriate for these uncertain and\nstressful times. Both John McCain and\nBarack Obama have political positions\nthat they honestly and sincerely believe\nin, but it is Obama who recognizes the\nfailures of the past and realizes that a\nnew direction is needed for America.\nBoth John McCain and Barack Obama\nhave policies that they believe are cor-rect, but it is Obama who will help\nthe American middle class and ensure\nAmerica\u2019s safety on the international\nstage. Both John McCain and Barack\nObama are ready to be President of\nthe United States, but it is only Obama\nwho will truly lead. The skinny kid\nwith the funny name beats McCain on\ncharacter, temperament and policy.\nThe world is a much less stable place\nthan at the beginning of the 21st century but we can be a little more confident\nabout the future if on Tuesday, Senator Barack Obama is elected the 56th\nPresident of the United States.\nThe No Child Left Behind (NCLB) act\nof 2001 is one of the more controversial pieces of legislation of recent years.\nThe attempt to ensure consistent levels of education across the country by\nextending the use of standardized tests\nhad a mixed reception, and Obama\nhimself has claimed that \u201ccreativity\nhas been drained from classrooms\u201d as\na result.\nHis support for NCLB, however, is\nevidenced by his plan to divert an extra $18 billion per annum into fulfilling the act\u2019s original intentions. This\nmuch-needed boost should be able to\nput this policy back on track, allowing\nfor improvements in math and science\neducation and more intensive teacher\ntraining.\nA focus he shares with his Republican rival is on increasing the choice of\nschools on offer. By offering universal\npreschool programs and the first $4000\nof college tuition entirely free, Obama\nhopes to make America regain its primacy on matters of education.\nEducation Economy Healthcare Foreign Affairs\n\u2018Middle Class Americans Tax Relief\u2019\nhave been five of the most dominant\nwords of the Obama campaign. By\nproviding a tax cut for working fami-lies, eliminating all income taxation\nfrom seniors earning $50,000 a year,\nand simplifying the taxation process,\nthe Obama-Biden plan should be able\nto ensure 150 million workers get \u2018the\ntax relief they need.\u2019\nOnthequestionoffairtrade,Obama\u2019s\nfocus is currently on changing the relevant legislation, creating a framework\nin which American economic security\ncan be safeguarded.\nObama\u2019s comprehensive energy plan\nis characterized by his decision to create 5 million jobs in the domain of environmental energy \u2013 so-called \u2018green\ncollar\u2019 jobs. Much has also been made\nof his eagerness to invest in the scienc-es, clean energy and new technology.\nHis economic emphasis can be said\nto be on creating tax cuts and a generally favourable financial environment\nfor lower- to middle-income workers.\nThe fundamental problem with American healthcare policy is the number of\npeople with too little or no insurance.\nBy making such insurance more affordable and easier to access, the ObamaBiden plan hopes to ensure universal\ninsurance coverage.\nObama has made especially strong\ncommitments to changing the way employees pay for their health insurance.\nBy removing the need for workers to\npay taxes on insurance paid for by em-ployers, households should be able to\nsave nearly $2500 a year.\nObama has also announced his intention of requiring insurance companies to provide fair, stable premiums to\nall clients. This, along with the Small\nBusiness Health Tax mentioned above,\nneed substantial funding to be put into\npractice.\nTo pay for them, the Obama-Biden\nticket are withdrawing the tax credit\noffered by Bush to Americans earning\nmore than $250,000 a year, and keeping the estate tax at its 2009 level.\nIf any issue has taken centre stage in\nthe \u201808 election circus, it\u2019s the attitude\nof the two candidates towards foreign\npolicy. For Obama especially, this is\nan area where he has been held up\nto recurring criticism for his lack of\nexperience.\nWith arguably the most qualified\nSenator in Congress running for VP by\nhis side, however, those criticisms have\nbeen silenced and slowly replaced by\njudgments on actual policy.\nObama plans to be tough on loose\nnuclear weapons, and to be watchful of\nthe hands into which they fall. He is also\nready to negotiate with Iran, though in\na \u2018tough, presidential\u2019 manner.\nThe most substantial foreign policy\nchange is set to be precisely in the way\nforeign policy is conducted. After years\nof being ridiculed for their international attitude, \u2018American diplomacy\u2019 is set\nto be \u2018renewed\u2019.\nSupport for Israel, however, is set to\nbe a continuing element in America\u2019s\nforeign policy.\nObama\nEarly life\nBarack Obama was born in\nHawaii August 4th, 1961. His\nparents were Barack Obama\nSnr and Ann Dunham.
