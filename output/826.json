    "content": "Science\nNeural Networks\nCan computers simulate the human thought process?\nOur minds are indescribably complex and yet are made up\nof the simplest of units, the so called 'neurons'. It is the\ncomplexity of the connections between these neurons that\nmake our brains so powerful, not the neurons themselves.\nScientists are now finding ways of simulating these\nconnections on computers in research which may ultimately\nproduce 'Artificial Intelligence' - the thinking computer.\nRamin Nakisa investigates.\nWe can never know, said the\nphilosopher Kant, what a thing is\nlike ' in itself because our very\nobservation casts things onto the\nbases of space and time. Science up\nto the present day has dealt with the\nknowledge of things-in-themselves\nrather than the mental machinery\nwith which we form our picture of\nthe world. Neural nets should\nunderstand the universe as we\nunderstand the universe and by\nbuilding models of this machinery\nwe are gaining a great insight into\nhow our very 'selves' function.\nHuman brains have evolved over\nmillions of years so that the answers\nto many problems in artificial\nintelligence are literally within our\nown heads. Understanding the\nan wer s, by understanding the brain,\nhas proved to be very difficult.\nNeural networks have all the\nessential ingredients of brains, that\nis they are made of many simple\nunits that switch one another on\nand off.\nThere are two ways of trying to\nunderstand how the brain works;\nThe top down approach: We know\nwhat things a brain must do, and so\nwe can speculate as to how the brain\ndoes them.\nThe bottom up approach\nWe know what units the brain is\nmade of and can therefore build\ncollections of units like these to see\nwhat they can do.\nThe top-down method of building\na car is to specify what it must\nachieve ie. it must.be able to carry\nhuman passengers at a reasonable\nspeed, it must run on easily\navailable fuel... The bottom-up\nmethod of building a car is to buy-all the parts, and bolt them together\nin inspired ways until the resulting\nmachine works.\nLooking at the brain bottom-up\nwe see that it consists of ten\nthousand million neurons, or brain\ncells, which receive and send\nelectrical impulses down nerve\nfibres to other cells. One neuron can\nconnect to a maximum of one\nthousand other neurons, in a very\ncomplex array.\nOn a larger scale, considering the\nbrain top down, it looks rather like\na walnut, with a crinkly surface\ncalled the cortex. Crinkliness is\nnature's way of maxim ising the\nsurface area, so that by making the\nsurface of the cortex crinkly she has\nfitted more room for neurons to\ninteract. There are separate substructures in the brain such as the\ncerebellum (little brain),\nhippocampus, thalamus etc and this\nalmost always means separate\nfunctions in biology. For example\nthe cerebellum is thought to be\nresponsible for fine tuning movements and coordination. It\nwould be impossible to give\nsufficient account of our present\nknowledge of brain structure in this\narticle, but suffice it to say that there\nis a great deal of knowledge but little\nunderstanding.\nTaken together these two approaches only allow a finite\nnumber of architectures for some\nfunctions of the mind. At the\nmoment the emphasis of research is\non finding methods of computation\nfor each problem separately without\nintegrating these into a machine\nwhich can solve a variety of\nproblems. But even in their present\nearly stage of development some\ninteresting results have been\nobtained.\nJust as statistical physics can\nderive the macroscopic behaviour of\ngases from the physics of a single\nparticle, so it may be possible to\nderive the physics of mind from that\nof a single neuron, and the\ninteraction of groups of neurons.\nWhy Use Neural Nets?\nThere are limits to every computer\nset by its speed, memory and most\nof all by its programmer. Using\npresent day computers one has to\n'The answers....are literally within our own head.'\ntranslate well defined problems into\nan explicit set of instructions which\ncan be interpreted by a computer.\nIf we want to solve a problem which\nhas no exact solution, we can write\ndown a set of differential equations\nand quite easily create an algorithm\nto give their approximate solution.\nThere are a large group of.\nproblems in artificial intelligence\nwhich would require an immense\nnumber of rules, and so cannot\neasily be solved by a computer in real time, since computers need a set\nof IF... THEN... statements to cover\nall possible situations. Speech\nrecognition is just such a problem.\nOne has to pick out words in real\ntime with a noisy background and\na huge variation in accent. It is\nextremely difficult to find a set of\nrules which could cope with such\nvariations, but it is possible to build\na neural network which can be\ntrained on various examples of\nspeech obviating the necessity of\nrules. A network, because it learns\nfrom examples, can cut\ndevelopment costs by an order of\nmagnitude in problems dealing with\npattern \u2022 recognition.\nSome pattern recognition tasks\ncan be tedious for humans, and in\nthese cases neural nets come into\ntheir own. For example, in screening\nfor breast cancer X rays of breasts\nhave to be checked for tumours\nwhich show up only faintly. Neural\nnets have been successfully trained\nto check for such growths. In\nfactories parts must be checked\nbefore assembly, and again this task\nPage 10 FELIX February 3 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nAids I Dear Bill,\nHaving just read the letter by Emmanuel\nSaridakis, we feel compelled to write in response.\nMr Saridakis seems to object to the contents of\nthe ICU AIDS Day, describing them as 'totally\nirrelevant'. How can anyone pretend that drug\nabuse, homosexuality and family planning have\nno connection with the general issue of AIDS?\nHe also complains about the money spent by\nICU on the AIDS Day. From his description,\never thing provided was free. Syringes and\ncondoms are distributed without charge by the\nrelevant organisations. From our point of view,\nMr Saridakis' argument is non-existent and\npurely indicative of his ignorance of the factors\naffecting AIDS and its spread.\nThe views expressed in Mr Saridakis' letter\nillustrate the need for days like the AIDS Day,\nin our opinion, acquiring life-saving information\nis priceless.\nYours,\nSophie Wardle, Physics 1,\nGareth Davies, Physics 1.\nWendy's Glasshouse\nDear Bill,\nFirstly, may I point out a few inaccuracies\nwithin last week's letters page:\n1. To Nicky Fox\u2014Neil McClusky is the Council\nChairman.\n2. To Simon Bradshaw\u2014The minutes of the St\nMary's merger working party were put to Council\nto decide whether or not they should be\nsubmitted to aUG M. Anybody who was under\nthe impression that Council has the power to\nenforce such a decision is misguided. Your\ncomment therefore about not consulting the\nstudent body is secondhand, incorrect\ninformation no doubt derived from an irate Dave\nClements.\n3. To Ashley Unitt\u2014The posters in question were\nprivately funded, not by Club funds.\nThe question as to whether the Club can\nindulge in anything not directly connected with\nwater polo is a case of constitutional\ninterpretation. This interpretation is at the\ndiscretion of the committee as defined in their\nconstitution. If the committee did not support the\naction, the person responsible would have been\nacting unofficially, that however is a different\nproblem and one that I cannot be blamed for. It\nis not my job to check that every poster reflects\na club's committee decision exactly.\nAlso, Bill, your news page contained a rather\nbiased cartoon which goes against your own policy of news is news, opinion is opinion. When\nI complained to someone that FELIX was too\nbiased about the U GM issue, they answered that\nI could have submitted a letter stating any opinion\nI might like to. However, you have stressed to\nthe Exec on many occasions that letters and\nreports must be submitted by12.30 pm on Mondays. Now unless Simon Bradshaw\nemulated the Sun by writing a letter on a decision\nwhich had not yet been decided (ie the report of\nTorvill and Dean winning the Olympic medal\neven though the newspaper had been printed\nbefore they won) then you accepted that letter\nfor some extenuating circumstances. Those\ncircumstances are your complete and utter bias\ntowards maintaining UG Ms,a bias which clouds\nyour ability to present an informative FELIX\nrather than an indoctrination of your beliefs.\nYou are not the Union's God, Bill and some\nof the stones you are throwing might one day\nsmash the panes in your glass house.\nYowrs,\nlan Morris.\nHole rants\nDear Bill,\nI feel I must reply to the highly misinformed\nletter by Ashley Unitt. The reason why the\nstudents against loans posters were headed by\nthe title 'Swimming and Water Polo Club' was\nto legal is e the posters. As a group of students\nforming a students against loans society we\nneeded a legitimate title for our posters before\nour society was officially formed. The Swimming\nand Water Polo Club title was used because it was\nan official title and because the Club felt that the\nloans system may prevent water polo players\nfrom coming to Imperial College. At no time did\nwe spend any of the Club's, or the Union's, money on these posters as they were privately\nfunded.\nI would also like to comment on the\nConservative Society's statement that 'We should\nnot think that the current left ish rabble is\nrepresentative of more than a handful of hacks'.\nFirstly, the membership of Imperial College\nStudents Against Loans Society consists of people\nfrom the entire spectrum of political thought,\nincluding several former Conservative voters (eg\nmyself). Secondly, that the 1,700 people who\nsigned the petition against loans, do not\nconstitute a handful of backs. This number is\nseveral orders greater than the average turn out\nat a Consoc meeting.\nJulian Moore, Treasurer Swimming\nand Water Polo Club.\nVote for me\nDear Bill,\nIn reply to Nicky Fox's letter of January 271 do\nhappen to be the Union Council Chairman. I was\nonly asked to chair the meeting with Mr Peter\nBrooke at a couple of hours notice and I was\nprepared prior to that for questioning the MP myself. I'm afraid I may well have come across\na little biased but I think the comments reflected\nthe feeling of the meeting. On the whole the\nmeeting was well ordered, the questions\npertinent and representative of the persons\npresent at the meeting. If offered the opportunity\nof chairing another such meeting I would surely\nstand down in favour of those better qualified.\nI believe the Labour spokesman on Education\nmay be speaking some time in the near future\nNicky, fancy a job?\nOver to Bill 'it pains me to have to devote so\nmuch space that's why I 've put it in double size\nprint Goodwin'. A few more factual inaccuracies;\n1. There are more than 25 students on Council.\nIn fact, of the 50 posts there was around 70%\nattendance of the posts filled at last term's Council meetings.\n2. My name is spelt McCluskey.\n3. You intimate that I ignore mandates to do\nwork. Far from it, Council papers have been out\non time for every Council so far not withstanding\nthe propensity of bump h.I just wish Council\nmembers would stick to the motions and papers\npresented instead of deviating to heart felt\n'discussion' completely unrelated to the matter\nin hand.\nAnd there's more...Council sketch pl9 Jan 27,\nyet more inaccuracies! 'The motion made it no\nlonger compulsory for sub-committees to present\ntheir minutes to Council', referring to my motion.\nSorry, but as far as I'm aware it's never been\ncompulsory to present minutes of subcommittees to Council, simply tradition to\npresent a selected few. In passing the motion\nCouncil democratically agreed that all minutes of\nall sub-committees be available for all to see in\nthe Union General Office.\nNeil McCluskey, Council Chairman.\nPS. Congratulations on a wonderfully unbiased\nFELIX of Jan 27, you obviously thought very hard\nabout which articles to include so that you gave\na fair view of both sides of the coin. It seems a pity that you've got a double-headed coin.\nWhat a rot terI am\u2014Ed\nHigh farce\nDear Bill,\nAbove the core of every politician lies a thin\nveneer of decency necessary to obtain their\nelection. Last night that layer, snake-like, was\nshed, the hideous face of totalitarianism revealed\nfrom behind the mask.\nThe three weapons of democracy are a free\npress, a directly accountable executive body, and\na free flow of information from the committees\nthat make up that body. Last night attacks fell\non all three.\nThe first blow came in a change to the\nproceedings of the Council. As the rules used to\nstand, the chairman of a Sub-committee of\nCouncil was required to submit the minutes of\neach meeting to the full Council for approval as\na fair and accurate version of the events that took\nplace.\nNow the rules are different. All that now has\nto be submitted is a report, written by the\nChairman, of his version of events. At no time\ndo the minutes of the meeting have to be passed\nor approved.\nThe second blow came with the main order of\nbusiness\u2014the St Mary's merger working\ncommittee report and motion. The working\ncommittee, after giving the matter 'a great deal\nof thought over the Christmas Holiday'\u2014S Snell\n(89), had come to the conclusion that to hold\nUG Ms on one site only would be undemocratic.\nTheir recommendation? Abolish UG Ms and establish Council as the sole policy making body\nof Imperial College Union. Ordinary students will\nbe able to have motions raised at Council if they\ncan collect a petition with 150 signatures, but they\nwill not have an automatic right to speak, and\nthey will be unable to vote.\nPerhaps the saddest moment of the night came\nPage 2 FELIX February 3 1989\n\n"

He added that the working\nparty had spent a long time\ndiscussing the matter and pointed\nout that the decision had 'not been\ntaken lightly'.\nSpeaking against the motion,\nUnion Life member Dave Parry said\nthe working^ party had not considered the ramifications of the\nmotion they were proposing and\nthat they had not consulted the rest\nof the student body. He pointed out\nthat they had not consulted the\nCollege on proposed increases in Union representation on College\nCommittees and added that the\nCollege would be unlikely to accept\nsuch changes.\n'The Union is the collective voice\nof students. Without Union officers\ndirectly reporting to its members the\nUnion will become divorced from\nthe people it represents' he said.\nThe motion was taken to the vote\nfollowing a procedural motion by\nNick Jarman.

    "content": "Science\nis extremely tedious. By feeding the\nimage of a bolt into a trained\nnetwork one has a reliable quality\ncontrol system (which is now used\nby General Motors).. Voice\ncontrolled machines are in the\ndevelopment stage, but even now\nsome are 100% efficient.\nAn interesting way around the\nproblem of a noisy environment has\nbeen found at the Royal Signals and\nRadar Establishment in Malvern. An image of the mouth is input with the\nsound of a voice so that the network\nhas more clues as to what is being\nsaid. The network soon learns that\nfor the letter 'e'a speaker will show\ntheir teeth, or the shape of the\nmouth for the letter 'o'. There are\nalso many military applications. For\nexample, one can train a net to\nrecognise a fighter aircraft and\ndistinguish it from civilian aircraft or\nother friendly aircraft, as shown\nbelow.\nComputer Models\nBefore being built in hardware\nnetworks are tested in computer\nsimulations. Computer models\nconsist of a set of neuron-like units\nwhich are connected to each other.\nEach unit can be either on or off. In\na network, a neuron 'listens' to its\nneighbours, and decides whether to\nswitch on or off from What it hears.\nFor example, imagine you are a neuron and lots of your neighbours\nare telling you to switch on and only\na few are telling you to switch off;\nyou would switch on. Some\nneurons are more influential than\nothers, and this is accounted for by\nhaving a number to represent their\npersuasiveness.\nThere are a huge number of\ncomputer-simulated models in the\nliterature, but most are variations on\ntwo themes. The most popular\nmodel at the moment for practical\napplications is called the error back-propagation model, but another\ninteresting model has been created\nrecently by John Hopfield.\nError Back-Propagation\nThis type of network is based on\na layered structure with data\npassing from one layer to the next.\nEach unit in the input layer is\nconnected to each unit in the inner\nlayer, and each unit in the inner\nlayer is connected to each unit in the\noutput layer.\nLearning is a matter of changing\nthe connections of the network so\nas to map each input pattern to the\ncorrect output pattern, and so each\ntype of network has its own 'learning rule' describing how to\nchange the connection strengths.\nLet us imagine that the network is\nbeing trained to recognise faces. In\nthis case the input layer would\nconsist of the pixels making up the\ndigitised image of a face. One would\nbuild up a large body of training\nmaterial consisting of digitised\npictures and the correct answers as\nto who was depicted in the picture.\nA long standing problem was\nfinding the learning rule for inner\nunits since we, as the trainers, of\nnetworks, only know the desired\noutput values. This problem was\nsolved by Rumelhart in 1986 by\nusing separate learning rules for\noutput units and inner units.\nTraining\nThe training data is compiled first\nof all. For a face recognise r this\nwould contain a few thousand\nphotographs of, say, ten people\ntaken in different lighting conditions\nand angles with different\nexpressions. With each picture one\nhas to have the correct answer ie.\n'this is Bill Goodwin'. The following\nprocedure is then followed.\n1. From the training data feed in\nactivities coding for the picture of a face into the input layer.\n2. Calculate activity of inner layer\nfrom the activity of the input layer.\n3. Calculate activity of output layer\nfrom the activity of the inner layer.\n4. For each unit in the output layer\ncompare actual activity with desired\n(or target) activity.\n5. Change output to inner layer\nconnections according to\nRumelhart's rule for output to inner\nlayer connections.\n6. By feeding back the change in\nweights to the output units, change\nthe input to inner layer connections.\n7. Repeat 1-6 until the network\nrecognises the training corpus\npictures correctly. The network is\nnow trained!\nIt is interesting that networks can\ngeneral is e what they have learnt. If\nthe network is now shown a picture\nof one of the ten people which was\nit has not seen before (even if the\nperson is disguised) the net may still\nrecognise them.\nThe problem with error back-propagation is that training can be\nslow. For tasks in which the\nenvironment stays fixed, such as a factory floor, this presents no\nproblem once the network has been\ntrained. But in the battlefield if a new enemy tank was built, for\nexample, the net would have to be\ncompletely retrained from scratch -a process which may take a few\nhours.\nHopfield Networks\nHopfield is a physicist who lives\nin California and wears shorts. His\nnets are based on physical ideas and\ndesigned with electronics in mind.\nTheir architecture is not feed-forward like Rumelhart's, instead\nthey consist of a set of fully\nconnected units. This means that\nevery neuron (or amplifier in\nelectronic language) is connected to\nevery other neuron in the net. Each\nneuron is rather like a proposition,\nsuch as 'It is raining'. If the 'raining'\nneuron is on then the 'sunshine'\nneuron must be off, so that a negative connection would exist\nbetween rain and sunshine.\nThe network is programmed by\nspecifying the connection strengths\nbetween the units. The net starts off\nin a random state and changes to a state which represents its answer.\nFor example, imagine a simple net\nto recognise animals. There might\nbe neurons representing fur r in es s,cud d lines s, and sca lines s. If we start\nthe system off with the furry, cuddly\nneurons active then the net will\nrecognise some furry, cuddly animal\nsuch as a kitten. It would not go into\na state representing a scaly animal,\nsuch as a snake, because the scaly\nneurons would be inhibited by the\nfurry, cuddly neurons.\nOne can compare the process of\nrecognition to a ball rolling down a hill. The ball moves to a valley and\nstops where its potential energy is\na minimum. Instead of being in\nnormal space the net's state is a point in an N dimensional space\nwith one dimension for each\nneuron. The network starts off at\nsome point in the N space and\nmoves in the direction which\ndecreases its 'energy' until it reaches\na local minimum and stops\nchanging state. In this way one can\nencode a problem into the network\nso that its 'energy' minima occur at\npoints in the space which correspond to solutions of the\nproblem. The network will settle\ninto these minima, and the\nnetwork's answer is decoded from\nthis final state.\nMany problems in robotics and\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) are\noptimization problems such as\nwalking through a crowd as quickly\nas possible whilst bumping into as\nfew people as possible.\nOptimization problems are\nproblems in which one can define\nan energy which has to be\nminimise d. To give an example, you\nprobably solve an optimization\nproblem in tutorials: ' How can I get\naway with doing as little work as\npossible?' Here the 'energy' would\nbe the amount of work you have to\ndo, and it is this which must be\nminimise d. In a1985 paper Hopfield\ndescribes a' network which can\nconverge on a solution to the\ntravelling salesman problem (TSP)\nvery rapidly. Although the TSP is\nnot very\" important in AI it is useful\nin showing the general method for\nsetting up a net to solve an\noptimization problem.\nIn the TSP one has a set of cities\nwhich must each be visited once in\na tour, and the problem is to find the\nshortest path which accomplishes\nthis. One way of solving the\nproblem is to do an exhaustive\nsearch of all possible paths, but this\nis an immensely lengthy process.\nThe Hopfield net, on the other hand\ndoes not necessarily find the\nshortest tour but it does find a very\nshort tour, and it does so in a very\nshort time (a few hundredths of a second).\nThis is encoded by simply creating\nan N by N array of neurons. Each\nunit represents a city and its\nposition in the tour. The\nconnections are set up so that each\nneuron inhibits other neurons in its\nrow and column, so that the energy\nminima will code for matrices with\neach city visited only once. The\ndistance of the tour is added to the\nenergy so that only short paths are\nallowed as solutions.\nThe network fares very well\ncompared to standard algorithms in\nterms of the length of tour and\ncomputing time. An electronic\ncircuit can be very easily\nconstructed, and more complex\nproblems of more use in robotics\ncould be built based on this simple\ncircuit. Hopfield networks have now\nbeen built which solve time-dependent problems such as the\nrecognition of sequences of\npatterns. This has been done by\nintroducing communication delays\nbetween neurons; this makes the\nenergy surface change with respect\nto time creating new valleys which\nlead from one stable state to\nanother.\nThe Future\nNeural nets will never replace\ncomputers, but instead will complement them, filling the niches\nthat standard sequential\nprogramming cannot. Very few\npractical applications have been\ndeveloped commercially yet, but in\ntime this will certainly change.\nJudging from the amount being\nspent on research and development\nin the field of neural nets people\nseem to have realised their\nimportance. These rather strange\n'computers', built in our own image, may give computers a more\nhuman face. If computers could\nlisten to and 'understand' human\nspeech, and even reply to it,\ncomputers could really become user\nfriendly. They share our human\nfoibles, such as the tendency to\nmake mistakes and a' same time\nhave all that is be s1 he human\nmind like its parallel and highly\ninterconnected architecture. If\nmachines are ever to take over the\nworld, these are the best candidates.\nby Ramin Nakisa\nFebruary 3 1989 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

Leading\n1-0 with only 8 minutes remaining\nIC conceded the inevitable equalise r that took the game to extra time\nwhere a goal-mouth scramble\nbrought Birmingham the winner.\nThe pattern of play was established straight from the kickoff as Birmingham surged forward\nto win a rather dubious penalty\ndecision only to blast the resulting\nspot-kick against the bar\u2014with less\nthan thirty seconds having been\nplayed!\nThis signalled the beginning of a virtual siege of the IC penalty area,\nwhich only some stout defending\nand inspirational goal keeping prevented from bearing fruit.\nSpecial mention must be made of\nIvan Parkin who played superbly at\nleft-back after being drafted in at the\nlast minute.\nIt was not all one-way traffic,\nthough, and on a rare foray forward\nPip Peel wiggled through a packed\ndefence and turned beautifully to\ndrill the ball home and stun the\nmid landers. As half-time approached, IC suffered a cruel blow with the loss\nof key midfield man Paul Olden\nafter a clash of heads left him needing six stitches. The second half\nsaw Birmingham attacking\nun relentlessly but IC's composure\nat the back was admirable. The\ncrucial point of the match came\nfifteen minutes from the end when\nIC skipper Nigel Collier was clearly\npulled down inside the area having\nbroken through. The referee bottled\nthe decision and gave a free-kick on\nthe edge of the box rather than a penalty which would have surely\nwon IC the match.

    "content": "Reviews\nHenry IV, Pt 1\nHenry IV, who usurped Richard lis\ncrown, is now King. The Earl of\nNorthumberland, who helped him\nto the crown, has turned against\nhim. The King's son Prince Hal,\nspends his time in taverns with the\ndisreputable Falstaff. Hotspur,\nNorthumberland's son, raises a rebellion against Henry IV, advancing the claim of Hotspur's brother-in-law to the throne. Hal Joins the King to fight the rebels and\nkills Hotspur at the Battle of\nShrewsbury.\nMichael Cronin returns as King\nHenry. 1 was interested to see\nwhether he would expend on his\ncharacter in Richard II, which was\nlargely a black-and-white portrayal.\nBut here it is much the same. I was\nsurprised to learn that Henry IV was\nnot the central character, but\nappears occasionally throughout the\nplay. So, Cronin continues to play\nhim as a tough, resolute King, but\nwith little emotional subtlety.\nMost of the play concentrates on\nthe young Prince Hal's relationship\nwith his boozing, bungling elder y companion Falstaff. In their scenes\ntogether, the stage is full of people\nand the scenery condensed to\nsuggest intimacy and fellowship\namongst the pub folk, simpletons\nand scoundrels that the wanton\nPrince associates himself with.\nFalstaff is a lovable old buffoon\nplayed with zest and roguish\nimpudence by Barry Stanton. His tall tales and witticisms allow the\nplay to move on confidently.\nThe whole of the first half of the\nplay takes on an air of frivolity, as\nour senses are bombarded with an\nanachronistic blend of characters\nand costumes. We see Northern\nvo kel s, London bobbies and even\npunk scum balls. Richard II was set\nin the 19th Century but here it\nseems that any style of costume that\nfits the mood of the character is\nemployed. The costumes and general effervescence of the\nperformances are great fun, if a bit\noverdone. Especially the brash and\nfrenetic Hotspur, played by Andrew\nHigh Hopes\nSet around King's Cross, High Hopes\nexamines the contrasting lives and\npersonalities of an assortment of\ncharacters. Cyril, a despatch rider\nand his girlfriend Shirley; his sister\nValerie and her husband Martin;\nJones. His over-the-top antics are\nenjoyable to watch, but I couldn't help feeling that it was all a bit too\neccentric.\nIn the second half the tone of the\nplay becomes more serious, as the\nwars begin and loyalties\npronounced. But there are gems of\nhumorous interludes furnished by\nFalstaff and wry directional\nflourishes: While the King's men are\nattired in full regimental uniforms,\nFalstaff does battle in World War II\ncamouflage gear, emphasising his\ncowardliness. He is struck in the\nstomach by a sword, only to rise and reveal a protected belly, shielded\nwith a 'no entry' sign. It is here that\nhe delivers his famous 'The better\npart of valour is discretion' speech.\nThe characters and plot are\ncemented together by an excellent\nsolid performance by John Dougall\nas Prince Hal. I look forward to\nseeing how he develops in Henry IV\npt 2.\nI would recommend both these\nproductions, especially to those who\nbelieve Shakespearean plays to-be\ninaccessible, incomprehensible or\neven, dare I say it, boring. The plots\nand language are easy to follow and\none would feel better for the\nexperience.\nStudent standbys are available at\n\u00a36.\nNext week Henry IV pt 2 and\nHenry V. Sumit Guha.\nCyril's widowed mother, Mrs Bender and her yuppie neighbours\nLaetitia and Rupert. Their paths\ncross when Mrs Bender locks herself\nout of her house and again when\nValerie arranges a party for her\nmother's seventieth birthday.\nMike Leigh, the director has an\nestablished reputation in producing\nthose gritty true-to-life plays that\nwin enormous critical praise. He has\nsuccessfully transferred this realism\nto High Hopes to create a film that,\nbut for the farcical stereotypes of\nLaetitia, Rupert, Valerie and Martin\nwould be little removed from a documentary. The ludicrous\nyuppies and social climbing Valerie\nprovide some relief but leave an\nengaging yet unsatisfying mixture of\ncomedy and social observation.\nSo horrendous are the yuppies,\nValerie and her nasty wide boy husband that you feel no animosity\ntowards them. So human are Cyril\nand Shirley that you can sit and\nwonder how they go cast with such\nun human characters, although that\nI assume was the intention. They\nargue about Cyril' s doggedly\nidealistic socialism and whether to\nstart a family or worry about Mrs Bender, a marvellous if chilling\nportrayal of age and senility played\nby Edna Dore.\nThis is not a frivolous film, and\nmore fun can be had down the road\nwith Roger Rabbit. Yet for those\nwho prefer something a little more\ntesting, try High Hopes because the\nnote of optimism at the end more\nthan compensates for the dour plot.\nFebruary 3 1989 FELIX Page 15\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nUGM Sketch\nA Bill of Rights\nThe case for Britain having a Bill of\nRights grows more controversial,\nparticularly as the Government\nembarks stubbornly on the\nimplementation of tough antiterrorist and immigration laws.\nCharter 88 is the latest 'basket of\nproposals' in urge of a written\nconstitution and an entrenched Bill\nof Rights, and as the previous article\nsuggests, it has struck a chord in\nwidely diverse circles. What is,\nnaively, ignored by the agitators of\nCharter 88 is the immense, if not\nrevolutionary, changes that would\nhave to be undergone in the British\nConstitution to accommodate such\na document. And then, the question\nmust be asked, 'Will human rights\nnecessarily improve?'. The United\nStates has had an enshrined Bill of\nRights for almost two centuries\u2014is\nthe situation better there?\nApparently not, if one were to judge\nby recent 'Civil rights for blacks'\ndemonstrations.\nAn enshrined Bill of Rights (such\nas Charter 88) is consistent with the\nlogic of a written constitution; The\nmost obvious example is that of the\nUSA where the written constitution\nconsists of a conservative rigid\nframework, whose authority\nexceeds that of any elected\ngovernment. On the other hand the\nBritish constitution is largely\nunwritten and based on a system of\nflexible conventions.\nWhat the enthusiasts of Charter 88\nfail to anticipate is that in a written\nconstitution every piece of\nlegislation has to be laboriously\nshaped to the given standard\nstructure. This then is one of the\nmajor disadvantages of a written\nconstitution. A permanently\ninstalled document (such as Charter\n88) would create a cumbersome\nmonolith which could slow\ngovernment response to public\nopinion, sometimes fatally. A classic\n(if cruel) example is that the US( birth place of modern feminism)\nshould have no national equal\nopportunities legislation; the equal\nrights amendment (to provide\nprotection against sexual\ndiscrimination) was formulated in the heat of the Women's Movement\nin the 70s. But according to the US\nconstitution, any such amendment\nmust be ratified by a two-thirds\nmajority in the Congress.\nConsequently, the equal rights\namendment hauled through expensive and exhausting\ncampaigns in different states, finally\ndying from lack of the necessary\nnumber when its deadline for\nratification was reached.\nOn the other hand, Great Britain\nreacting to overwhelmingly social\npressure of the time, adopted a Sex\nDiscrimination Act almost within\nthe life time of a single Parliament.\nAt present, the essence of the\nBritish Constitution lies in its\nParliamentary sovereignty (that is,\nno legal body can oppose any act\npassed by the Parliament). In this\nway, the separation between the\nJudiciary and Parliament is\nmaintained. However, with the\nintroduction of a Bill of Rights, the\nJudiciary would be invariably pulled\ninto the political arena (after all, to\nwhich other body would the\nsupporters of Charter 88 entrust the\ntask of being above Parliament).\nThis could arguably give Judges,\nand not Parliament, the ultimate\ndiscretion in setting political\nlimitations on legal powers. In\nparticular, Charter 88 is based on a broad set of principles, the\napplication of which would depend\non the 'personal opinion' of the\njudge. One should remember that\nthe judges are unelected and hence\nnot answerable to the public, as\npoliticians are. In addition, the\n'politic is ation' of the 'unelected'\nJudiciary would bring them into\ndirect conflict with the 'elected'\nParliament, any realist would acknowledge the jealousy with\nwhich MPs protect their sovereign\npower. At most, the threatened\nParliament could be led to reviewing\nthe Judiciary, thus restricting the\nrestricting power of justice, itself a safeguard of freedom.\n\u2022 As Law Lord McCluskey argued\nthat final policy decisions should be\nmade by society as a whole through\nan elected Parliament and not by\njudges, no matter how 'upright' and\n'distinguished' they may be.\nEven if sufficient consensus to an\nincorporation of Charter 88 could be\nachieved, it is likely that the sharp\ndivisions and constant fluidity of\nBritish politics will ensure perpetual\nchallenges to the Bill.\nThe Conservative Party see the\n'right to own one's property' and\n'the right to work' unhindered\n(euphemism for an it trade unions)\nas basic human rights. On the other\nhand the Labour Party views the\nGovernment's right to own property and trade unions to\nexercise total power as their version\nof basic rights. Already there are\nallegations by the opposition party\nthat the Judiciary is politically\nbiased. With a Bill of Rights and\nsubsequent pot it ic is ation of the\nJudiciary, there would be absolute\nchaos in party politics. So unless\nparty politics were to die, legislation\nsuch as Charter 88 would be no\ngreater guarantee of liberty than\npresent.\nThus when the New Statesmen\nSociety (co-creators of Charter 88)\nspeak of creating popular politics\nout of 'Bourgeois Revolution', they\npresumably mean an injection of\nFrench democratic concepts into the\ntraditional British political system.\nBut the British tradition of\ndemocracy predates the French\nRevolution and human rights can be\nprotected by legislation despite the\nabsence of a written constitution;\nMagna Carta, Habeas Corpus and\nthe 1688 Constitutional Settlement\nprove so. An elected Government\nis always answerable to the people.\nHarsh oppressive laws can be\nopposed by intense lobbying from\nthe public and then there is the\nEuropean Court of Justice, to which\nthe Government is ultimately\nanswerable to.\nIndeed the agitator of Charter 88\nhave a point in that the Government\nis now operating in a world with\nlittle effective opposition, but a more\nrealistic approach is needed. The\ndesire to defeat an unbeatable\nGovernment by erecting supra-legislation is not a democratic\nimpulse, nor is it sound even in Charter 88's own terms.\nINTERNATIONAL ENGLAND v SCOTLAND\nShown on a50\" screen in the\nSnack Bar\nBar open all day\nREE entry\nSat 4th Feb, starts 2.00pm Union Officers tend to get a little\nterrified when faced with large\nnumbers of students. Sabbaticals\nsuddenly realise that these people\ncould fire them. Aspiring sabbaticals\nare cautious because a false word\ncould force them to become\naccountants immediately, as\nopposed to in a year's time. This is\nhow it was on Tuesday.\nWas it a successful publicity\ncampaign? Was it whipping of the\nMary's block vote? Was it a sudden\nand concerted abandoning of the\ngeneral apathy for Union affairs? For\nwhatever reason there were 600\npeople at the U GM, and the hacks\nshrank into the background.\nOccasionally the Exec were forced\nto speak on an issue. Even then they\nimmediately headed for the middle\nground of conciliation. Nigel Baker\nopposing Amin El-Kholy's motion\nto allow foreign language posters\nwas unnaturally polite. ' I'm opposing this motion but I don't want to annoy any foreign students\nif that's all right by you' The stars of the meeting were the\ncomplete random s who stepped out\nof obscurity to propose a procedural\nmotion that we go straight to a vote,\nto then vanish into the crowd\nwithout leaving a name for the\nannals of time. Are you sure you\ndon't want to be External Affairs\nOfficer?\nAnd finally, with the masses\nitching to get back to lab, we reached the motion on the abolition\nof UG Ms. Nigel decided to waffle\ninterminably about the entire\nhistory of ICU, Mary's and the\nuniverse finishing with '..but if you\ndon't want to, then we'll have to go\nback and think about it.' The opposition, having decided not to\nlet Cosmic speak, brought out their\npet dinosaur (Dave Parry). Dave\ntold people that it wasn't right,\nthey'd never have done it in his day,\nand people should have the right to\nask sabbaticals questions even if\nthey didn't want to answer them.\nAnother procedural motion to go\nstraight to a vote and we were\ntreated to a tall post grad telling us\nthat we were all first and second\nyears so we should listen to what\nolder people with more experience\nhad to say before we voted. That\none was carried straight off.\nAfter ten minutes of sham boli c mess the votes were taken on lots\nof bits of pink paper. Everyone,\nhaving voted to save democracy,\ndecided 'democracy can sod off\nnow, we're going to lab'. Despite\nthe astounding turnout from\nMary's, the astounding lii ul\nfrom IC won the day v1 is hist-.irv. Thev\nFebruary 3 1989 FELIX "

    "content": "Felix\nSubterranean peddle-cycle blues\nYou see us every day, weaving back\nand forth through the traffic on\nCromwell Road: luminous yellow\njackets flashing in the early morning\nsun. We are the people who eschew\nthe daily game of sardines on the\ntube. We are the ozone-friendly\ncommuters. We are the London\nCyclists!\nYea! Hallelujah! Brothers and\nSisters of the saddle, the wheeled\nshall inherit the Earth. But 1 am here\nto talk about the devil: the devil we\nall know, the London driver.\nToning down the evangelicals,\nwhat is it about the typical London\ndriver that makes him want to kill\nthe two wheeled road user? You can\nsee it in his face. His eyes mist over\nas he lines the furry dice up on your\nrear mudguard. The foot\nunconsciously reaches for the\naccelerator. The engine revs. A mind with but a single thought: to\nreduce Joe Cyclist to an ingenious\nnew road marking. 'Red Stain'; it\nmeans Cyclists Beware.\nNo drivers seem to be immune.\nThere is the 'Lombard' the man who\npart-exchanged his brain to buy a GTi. He sits there in the driver's seat, one hand on the car phone, the\nother on his secretary's knee and he\nwill race anything that moves. An unwary cyclist scuttles past him in\nthe queue for the traffic lights. The\nlights change. Five yards beyond\nthem, our two-wheeled hero, feels\na rush of air. Behind him there is the\nsound of a hi-fidelity, graphic\nequalise d car horn.\nAn experienced cyclist would\nknow what to do: pull over as fast\nas possible and watch as a smirk on\nan in plausible salary thunders past.\nBut our hero is new to London, he\nholds his ground. There is another\nblast on the horn and several\nthousand pounds of Vorsprung\nDurch Technick flys past millimetres\nfrom the handlebars. A lot of\n'Lombards' own blood-red cars; that\nway mistakes don't show.\nThen there's the 'Rep'\u2014People to\nsee, deals to do, money to make and\nnever enough time. He considers\nhimself to be a professional London\ndriver. ' Me, have an accident?\nNever! Reactions far to fast for\nthat\u2014 F***, those lights changed\nquick'. He slams on the brakes and\nold two wheels behind him becomes a permanent feature of the\nrear bumper.\nBut these are but foot soldiers in the Great War. Most Lombard's were extinguished in the Stock\nMarket crash and Reps don't venture into the darker back streets,\nat least not during office hours.\nThey are minor players compared\nwith the Black King of the motorists,\nthe London Cabbie.\nCabbies have the honour of\nsharing the few so-called cycle lanes\nwith their rightful owners. Only\nthey don't seem to see it like that.\nTo them, the pedal-powered are as\ngood as invisible. Your typical\nLondon Cabbie suffers from chronic\nbicycle blindness. All the cyclist ever\nsees of a cab is a cigarette ad\nrocketing past without so much as\nby-your-leave.\nBut the cabbie has more subtle\nweapons too. Picture this: the cyclist\nwaiting at traffic lights, the cabbie\nbehind him. Again the lights change\nto amber. These are London traffic\nlights, green is go, amber is go, red\nis go if there's nobody watching.\nThe cabbie thinks the cyclist should\nbe moving. The cyclist starts to\npedal, but apparently not fast\nenough. The cabbie stays on his tail,\nhe doesn't overtake, he doesn't even try to overtake, he just hovers\nthere. The cab speed up. The bicycle\nhas to match him. The cab speeds\nup more. The cyclist pedals faster\nand faster\u2014no time to change gear.\nAll effort going into staying ahead.\nNo attention is given to steering or\nbraking. A bicycle out of control\nthundering along the road. At the\nvery last minute the cab overtakes\nleaving the cyclist, legs aching and\neyes watering to totter on. A small\nbattle, no fatalities but the driver's undoubtedly the victor.\nI say no fatalities, but there do\nseem to be more bright red cabs on\nthe roads. Perhaps Lombard's found himself another job...\nSomething MUST be done!\nCyclists of the world unite, you have\nnothing to lose but your chains. We\n. must all pedal together. I have a dream, a dream that one day cyclists\nand drivers will live together in harmony. That drivers will leave a three-foot gap when overtaking.\nThat the council will repair all the\npot holes in the Kensington roads.\nThat cycle lanes will be found\nthroughout the land and Cabbies\nwill wait at traffic lights. This is my\ndream and it is a dream in which all\nmust believe, cyclists and drivers\nalike.\nAnd if the drivers cast aside these\nwords of wisdom, we must wait.\nWait until the petrol runs out and\neveryone has to drive Sinclair C5s.\nAnd the vengeance will be ours!!!!\nTHE BARON\nOF CHEAPSKATE\nDerek Dash was laughing. He knew\nit made him look senile but he\ncouldn't help it. This was the best!\nThe Chief Citizen had made such a fool of himself, he was even beating\nMad Dash, this time.\nLittle Lord Patacake, the Chief\nCitizen, had dreamt up a Working\nParty to entertain all of the citizens.\nAfter divine inspiration, he had\ncalled it SMUDGE. Few people\nknew what SMUDGE stood for and\nstill fewer cared, but it seemed\nimpressive.\nTo celebrate the Working Party,\nthe citizens had held a citizens'\nmeeting, where everybody jumped\nup and down and shouted a lot. At the end they had torn up lots of bits\nof paper, scribbled on them and\nthrown them in a box.\nLittle Lord Patacake had hoped\nthe citizens would like the Working\nParty and he had asked his good\nfriend, Phil Doodle to bring all his\nfriends along. Phil Doodle was the\nChief Citizen of all the Doctors and\nNurses and was very popular with\nthem. If he said 'Scribble on lots of\nbits of paper,' they would.\nLittle Lord Patacake's Working\nParty was such fun! Lots of people\nliked it and lots of people didn't. Some people felt so strongly about\nit that the v scribbled on sheet upon\nsheet of paper in a frenzy.\nEverybody felt that they were\nmaking a big decision as they\nfrantically scribbled upon their bits\nof paper.\nShould they have another\nWorking Party and have lots more\nbig meetings or should they let little\nLord Patacake and his chums spend\nall their mon ev without telling\nthem?\nWhen everybody felt they had\nscribbled on enough pieces of paper,\nsome of the citizens who could\ncount rummaged through the big\nbox full of paper. They decided that\nthe Working Party had been ruined\nand Little Lord Patacake would have\nto think again.\nNow it was time for Svdney\nSillvname to say the things that had\nto be said. Sydney had said so much\nrecently that he had thought about\nchanging his name again. The best\nsuggestion so far was Noggin the\nNog (name changed in aid of greater\nclarity).\nAll around Cheapskate the\ncitizens were talking about who\nwould be Chief Citizen next year.\nKneel McSlimesky had already told\neverybody he was going to be Chief\nCitizen but there were other moves\nafoot.\nDuncan Random had decided to\nstand and even ex\u2014clown Clare\nMacUseless was talking about the\nidea: Stephalump Snell was still\ndenying everything. The fact of the\nmatter was that things were not\ngoing to change a great deal if any\nof them got in.\nMeanwhile, In the heights of the\nSurefield Fortress, John Secretary\nwas thinking about his years at\nCheapskate. He hated the Baron\nand his wife and he wanted out.\nNow was as good a time as any, he\nthought. This Summer, he would\nleave, even if the Baron, Derek\nDash, was going to appoint a Yes\u2014\nMan in his place. He had so wanted\nhis friend from You-Loo to do the\njob, but he couldn't have\neverything. John knew that when\nhe went, all of his friends would\nfollow.\nWill Little Lord Patacake throw a wobbly?\nIs John Secretary really about to leave?\nWill Rob McNorthy ever appear in the\nBaron?\nWill Duncan Random do anything\nsignificant?\nFind out in the next episode.\nPage 6 FELIX February 3 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Editorial\nA victory for common sense.\nIn recent history there have been\nfew Union General Meetings\n(UGMs) as well attended as the\nUGM on Tuesday. The issue at\nstake, of course, was the abolition\nof Union General Meetings. Over six\nhundred students turned up and\ndespite the presence of 250\nstudents from St Mary's Medical\nSchool intent on removing UGMs,\nthe motion was defeated by 150\nvotes. It was indeed a victory for\ncommon sense.\nThe unofficial working party\nlooking into the problems of merger\nbetween St Mary's and IC Union\nwill now have to rethink the UGM\nproblem.\nFor those who are unaware of the\nsituation, the working party decided\nthat St Mary's would have difficulty\nattending IC UGMs and concluded\nthat the best way to deal with this\nproblem was to abolish UGMs. No\nUGM, no problem!\nI hope that this time the working\nparty will learn from their mistakes\nand bring a wider body of opinion\ninto their discussions. Otherwise,\nas we have seen, a group of ten\npeople can become fixated with a solution which, although ludicrous,\ncan seem to be the only solution.\nPerhaps it is time for an official\nworking party to be set up. If this\nparty reported regularly back to\nCouncil then so much the better; it\nwould allow ideas to be tossed\naround and developed much more\nthoroughly.\nLooking at the people who sat on\nthe working party it is easy to see\nwhy they favoured throwing out\nUGMs. Of the ten members in the\ngroup, eight were representing the\nConstituent College Unions (CCUs)\nand if UGMs were removed there\ni would be an inevitable increase in\nthe importance and influence of\nCCU UGMs and hence the CCUs\nthemselves.\nThe other two members of the\nCommittee were ICU President\nNigel Baker and Deputy President\nChas Brereton. I will hazard no\nguesses here as to what their views\nmight be. Suffice it to say that in\ncon jun uc tion with the rest of\nCouncil they would have gained\nmuch more personal influence in\nthe Union if UGMs were abolished.\nThis aside, I hope that as a Union\nwe can reach an agreement which\nwill be both to the benefit of the\naverage student and to the two\nunions.\nValentines FELIX Next weeks\nissue will be a special Valentines\nedition complete with a page or two\ndevoted to readers Valentine\nmessages.

Our Illustrious\nLeaders in the Union office have\nreached the state where the very\nmention of the words FELIX or\nUnion General Meeting reduces\nthem immediately to a catatonic\ntrance, and the good Mr Goodwin\nhas succumbed to stress to such an\nextent that he was actually rude - in\nfront of witnesses - to two people in\none day.\nWhat was all this about? Well, in\nretrospect, not a lot. The above\nIllustrious Leaders set up a working\nparty, which decided that it didn't think UG Ms were a very good idea.\nThe Illustrious Leaders Council\ndecided it agreed with the working\nparty, and tried to put a motion to\naUG M, abolishing UG Ms. Not surprisingly, the U GM disagreed\nwith this, and told the Illustrious\nLeaders so by defeating the motion\nin no uncertain terms. End of story.\nIf only! Walter is quite certain that\nthe story is only just beginning, and\nthat the next chapter will involve the\nIllustrious Leaders in a concerted\nattempt to curtail Mr Goodwins\nfreedom to print what he likes. He will keep telling you what your\nUnion is up to, and we can't have\nthat, can we?\nEnough of this drivel. News now\nof the strange collection of\nequipment which turned upon Prince Consort Road on Wednesday. Walter is in a position\nto dispel all vicious rumour: they\nwere in fact making a film about\nJerry Lewis, to be given the original\ntitle of 'Great Balls of Fire'.\nAnd now to a more important\nmatter. After all, it's very topical,\nthis business of Unions and films,\nbut you wouldn't want a whole\ncolumn full of it, would you? No, this is really important. Walter is\ndelighted to report that he was in error in assuming that all the\nAntipodean types who have taken\nover Gloucester Road are\nAustralians. Some of them are from\nNew Zealand, a fact your columnist\nonly discovered whilst ignoring his\ndoctors orders last night and getting\nsecurely drunk with a few of them\nin the wine bar of the Norfolk Hotel\n(a nice little claret called Fosters Kiwi\nSpecial). Anyone who has met Paul\nHogan will agree that anything -absolutely anything - is preferable\nto an Australian, and the names of\nNew Zealanders such as Ngaio\nMarsh have been heard all over the\ncivilised world. And in America.\nFebruary 3 1989 FELIX Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nThe war of the roses\nThe Old Vic\u2014until March 11\nThe English Shakespeare Company,\nunder the artistic directorship of\nMichael Bogdanov and Michael\nPennington present seven plays in\nShakespeare's history cycle over the\nnext six weeks. We will be\nreviewing each of the plays in the\nambitious theatrical undertaking\nover the next three weeks beginning\ntoday with Richard II and Henry IV\npth\nRichard II\nIn all too many of Shakespeare's plays, the speed of narration leaves\none weary and encumbered by the\nplot. But not so in this case. Swift\nand sure direction has made this\nplay what all good plays should\nbe\u2014a story told with eloquence and\nthe actor's art.\nMichael Pennington plays King\nRichard II, a wiley monarch deep set\nin corruption and revelling in self-importance and power. He expels\nHenry Bolingbroke, son of John of\nGaunt, from the country and on the\ndeath of Gaunt, si eze s Bolingbroke's rightful inheritance to\npay for Irish wars. While Richard is\nin Ireland, Bolingbroke returns to\nEngland and raises the country\nagainst the King. Richard returns\nfrom his campaigns to find his\nauthority swept aside. Reluctantly\nhe surrenders his crown to\nBolingbroke who becomes Henry\nIV, and Richard is imprisoned and\nkilled in Pomfret Castle.\nPennington portrays a Richard\nwho exhibits a churlish arrogance\nbefitting a spoilt child. When in power he is the ultimate authority,\nand although seemingly in control\nthere is always an unstable facet to\nhis character. His smile is an\nin si duo us grin and his eyes shifty,\n\"but his head is aloft. Yet his pride\ndisappears in the face of defeat, to\nsuch an extent that he seems\nquerulous.\nThis character is ation contrasts\nwell with the more down to earth,\nsolid presence of Bolingbroke,\nplayed by Michael Cronin. He shows little of his human traits apart\nfrom pride and workmanlike determination.\nBridging the gap between the two\nlead characters lies the forlorn\nreasoning and wisdom of the Duke\nof York (Colin Farrell), uncle to both\nRichard and Henry, who has to\nweigh up good and bad in the face\nof conflict.\nThere is a predominantly Victorian flavour to the sets and\nclothing. At the beginning of the\nplay we see Richard's court adorned\nwith amish mash of clothing styles\nand colours. Once Bolingbroke takes\nif\nfH\nover, the costumes become uniform\ngrey; very little colour but immaculately orderly, which cleverly emphasises the relative\nstyles of leadership.\nI think that the 19th Century\nsetting lessened the impact of the\nplay, by removing much of the\ncoarseness of the medieval period.\nIt is a common ploy these days for\nproductions to set Shakespeare's plays in different times, to\nemphasise the timeless quality of\nthe work. This production may not\nhave got the mood quite right, but\nit was an interesting experiment all\nthe same.\nRainman\nCharlie Babbitt is a smooth talking\ncar dealer interested in Buick's, Lamborghini's and himself. His father dies leaving three million\ndollars to Raymond Babbitt , a brother Charlie never knew he had. Raymond is an autistic savant\nwhich means he is mentally\nhandicapped, withdrawn in his\nown world, but also exhibits\nmoments of genius. Charlie is\nunderstandably upset \u2014 not because of the state of his brother,\nbut because he received no cash.\n' He' s inherited three million\ndollars, and he doesn't understand the concept of\nmoney? It's poetic, isn't it?'\u2014he\nexclaims.\nHe decides to kidnap his brother and together they journey\nacross America. Slowly Charlie\ndiscovers more about his past, his\nfather and that there's more to life\nthan looking after number one.\nTom Cruise, fresh from smiling\nhis way through Cocktail, plays\nCharlie Babbitt, and shows not\nonly that he can act, but that he\nis very good at it. But the show\nbelongs to Dustin Hoffman who plays Raymond, a man who acts\nlike a child, is prone to panic\nattacks and can't make eye contact. It is a role that only his\ngenius could pull off. Indeed,\nHoffman is so comfortable and natural that he detracts the attention away from himself and lets us focus on Tom Cruise's change from narcissism to\ncompanion. A good script, and excellent direction by Barry Levinson( Good Morning Vietnam)\nmake this film one to look out for\nat Oscar time.\nRelease date March3.

    "content": "News\nMarch success\nThe anti-loans demonstration took\nplace peacefully and successfully on\nWednesday despite large setbacks\nincluding the withdrawal of support\nby the National Union of Students\nand subsequently by the University\nof London Union (ULU) Executive\nCommittee. The police estimated\nthat between two and three\nthousand students participated in the march between Finsbury Circus\nand Shorditch Park. Despite fears\nabout rioting and violence, no\narrests were made.\nFred Jarvis of the National Union\nof Teachers, expressed his sympathy and stressed that a great\nsense of brother ship was needed\nbetween students of all disciplines\nin order to present a 'united front'\nagainst loans.\nLouisa Woods,15 year-old\nChairperson of the Hackney South\nLabour Party Young Socialists,\nclaimed that the implementation of\nloans would take the right to\neducation away from the poor. 'We\nwill not give up,' she said, 'we'll\nfight 'till we win.' Keith Budden UL U International\nOfficer, whose name was on the\npublic order bill for the march, was\nproud of the success of the demo,\nbut disappointed that the route was\nso 'ineffective'. He stressed that the\nroute was imposed by the police and\nwas the only option available.\nSimon Aldis, Co-President of the\nSchool of Oriental and African\nStudies (SOAS), and senator to\nUL U, told FELIX that he felt the\ndemo would have far more success\nin the fight against loans than the\nNUS march on November 24 1988.\nIn response to IC Union's lack of\nsupport for the demonstration he\ndescribed the Union as\n'shortsighted', and said it showed\nthat the sabbaticals do not take their\nposition seriously'.\nIf they have no confidence in sabbaticals of other unions to\norganise the march of their own backs, they obviously don't feel\nconfident enough to take such\naction themselves', he remarked.\nHe felt that the banning of\npublicity about the action was the\nmain factor leading to the poor\nturnout from Imperial, and said it\nreflected very badly on IC Union\nOfficers. 'They have no right to\nrepresent students and ought to\nresign', he said.\nIC Union President Nigel Baker\ntold FELIX he still stood by his\noriginal decision not to support the\nmarch but added that if he had been\nable to for see the eventual success\nhe may have reacted differently.\nSagging ceiling\nA room in Garden Hall was left with\na sagging ceiling last Friday when\nan upstairs bathroom flooded. The\noccupant has been told there is no\nroom elsewhere in the Hall while\nthe ceiling is repaired.\nLoretto O 'Callaghan, the College\nAccommodation Officer, said that if\nthe ceiling was considered\ndangerous by the Managing Surveyor of Residences, Mr Peter\nHall worth, then the student\ninvolved would be given urgent'\npriority on the waiting list in other\nhalls.\nMr Hallworth said that he does\nnot consider this event particularly\ndangerous and commented that 'If\nthe student wishes to move there is\nnothing stopping him'. Mr Hallworth went on to say that\nthe recent collapses have been due\nto water seepage, usually through\nthe negligence of students. He added that the onus is on students\nto report any defect in their ceilings.\nICU to hold DES vigil\nAs part of its liaison with the\nNational Union of Students (NUS),\nIC Union will be holding a vigil\noutside the Department of\nEducation of Science (DES) on February 6th from 8am to 6pm. Union President, Nigel Baker told\nFELIX that he hopes to display a coffin at the vigil, bearing a copy of\nthe cover of the Government's White Paper on student loans and\nthe words' R.I.P. Higher Education.'\nThe vigil will be held on a rota\nsystem with 5 people present\nthroughout the day. Anybody interested in attending the vigil\nshould contact Mr Baker in the\nUnion Office today. Numbers are\nstrictly limited to 5 people at any one\ntime to meet with the law on unofficial picketing.\nThursday's wrestling tournament in the Great Hall.\nSecurity\nlodge\nA new security lodge has been\ninstalled at the entrance to the\nUnion Building to provide security\nguards with a view over Beit\nQuadrangle.\nChief Security Officer, Geoff\nReeves, told FELIX that the new\nlodge will l be in addition to the\npresent porter's lodge under Beit\nArch, which will be altered to\nprovide messengers with a 'Challenge point.' Mr Reeves added\nthat he intends to provide a guard\nin the new lodge from 7am until\nmidnight.

    "content": "THE r.*R OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nREPORT SETS 'TARGET DATE' 1993\nRHBNC MERGER\nA working party report published this week has suggested that Imperial\nCollege and Royal Holloway and Bedford New College should merge to\nform a College similar to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\nin America. The report recommends that a final decision be made by the\nSummer of this year, with a 'target date' for a merger in 1993-4. It also\nseeks the setting up of a Joint Planning Committee between the two\nColleges to explore the implications of the merger. The report\nacknowledges that the financial difficulties of RHBNC and IC will not\nbe solved by a merger, and concludes that the 'longer term advantages'\nof merging outweigh the short-term disadvantages.\nThe working party suggest that\nfirst-year Science, Engineering and\nArts undergraduates and half of the\nsecond year students should be\nhoused on the Egham site. They\nanticipate that this arrangement will\nprove attractive to students who will\ninitially be housed 'at a comparatively sheltered and close\nknit campus at Egham' before\nmoving to a 'more independent\nexistence in Central London'\nThe financial difficulties faced by\nboth IC and RH B NC will not be\nsolved by a merger and a merged\ninstitution will need to make cuts in\norder to break even according to the\nreport. Because a merger would not\nchange the financial situation of\neither College, says the report, each\nsite would be responsible for settling\nits own debt; Imperial College faces\na deficit of \u00a34M and RH B NCa deficit of \u00a32.5M by 1992.\nA merger between the two\ninstitutions would allow new\naccommodation and research units\nto be built on the Egham site, says\nthe report. According to the Rector,\nProfessor Eric Ash, the College may\nbe able to take out loans for new\n\u2022 accommodation and set rent levels\nsuch that the College's deficit is not\nincreased. The Rector commented\nthat building in South Kensington\nwould not be possible because the\n'We are militant' rents involved would be 'out of this\nworld' but added that if building\nwere to take place on 'free land in\nEgham' the arithmetic would 'look\nquite good.\nThe report states that the merged\nin situ tion will concentrate on\nScience and Technology but\nhighlights the possibility of\nincorporating arts into scientific\ncourses. The working party\ncompares Imperial College with the\nMassachusetts Institute of\nTechnology (MIT) and quotes an\ninternal report on undergraduate\nengineering education at MIT which\nstates that 'it is essential that\nengineering undergraduates receive\na broad foundation in the\nhumanities, arts and social\nsciences.'\nThe possibility of 'new areas of\nresearch between the Arts and\nSocial Sciences and the Sciences and\nTechnology' and the possibility of\nbroadly based four-year degree\ncourses are also discussed in the\nreport.\nThe report does not mention the\neffect of a merger on the Student\nUnions. The omission was\ndescribed by Union Deputy President, Chas Brereton, as\n'disgraceful.' He stressed that the\neffect on clubs and societies would\nbe highly detrimental and described\nthe whole concept of a merged\nUnion as 'a bloody nightmare.'\nUnion President, Nigel Baker, told\nFELIX that the problems which have\narisen between St. Mary's Student\nUnion and IC Student Union are a direct result of the lack of\nconsideration given to the Union in\nthe discussion of that merger. He\ninsists that at least one bat ical officer from each of IC .1. 1B NC Unions should be of the\nnew joint committee to be set up\nand intends to discuss this proposal\nwith the Rector in the near future.\nUGMs\nhere to\nstay\nA controversial motion to abolish\nUnion General Meetings (UGMs)\nwas defeated by 150 votes at the\nUnion General Meeting on Tuesday. The meeting was attended\nby over six hundred students,\nincluding a delegation of over 200\nfrom St Mary's Medical School in\nwhat has been described as the most\ncrowded U GM since 1986. The\nmotion was met by strong\nop postion from a group of\nconcerned students and IC Union's three media services who organised\na petition and a poster campaign in support of retaining UG Ms. The motion, tabled by an\nunofficial Union working party\nlooking into the problems of\nmerging the Imperial and St Mary's students' Unions, was brought to\nthe U GM after receiving approval\nfrom Council last week. It was\ndesigned to solve the problems\nstudents from St Mary's would have\nin attending UG Ms on the Imperial\nsite, and presented a number of\nrecommendations on\naccommodation, clubs amd UL U representation.\nThe motion called for the abolition\nof UG Ms and the establishment of\nCouncil as the supreme decision\nmaking body of the Union. Under\nthe proposal, students would be\nable to mandate Council to discuss\nmotions provided the v had 25\nsecond ers, but they would not have\nthe right to vote and speaking rights\nwould be given at the discretion of\nCouncil. The motion allowed\nEmergency General Meetings to be\n* lied through a petition of 150\nUnion members and mandated\nUnion Officers to report to students\nb v pinning reports on departmental\ncont'd on back page\nISSUE \u00a3 2 T&2 fe3 FEB 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nView from\nThe Battle of the\nbc lTS Sydney Harbour Bridge With its three main bars, the\nUnion, Southside and the Holland\nClub along with a number of hall\nbars, Imperial College has a massive\nturnover of beer. It is the largest\noutlet in the South East of England\nand as a combined purchasing unit\nit not only qualifies for extremely\nlarge discount rates but has massive\nbargaining power with which to\nsecure even greater discounts. Its\ndiscount rates are at least equal\nthose of the whole of the NUS and\nit is rumoured to have secured a higher discount that can not be\ndisclosed for political reasons.\nYet prices in the Union Bar and\nSouthside have passed the \u00a31 figure\nwhilst undergoing a22% price rise\nover last Summer. Over the last five\nyears prices have only increased by\nabout 20%. The Holland Club, a members only club for non academic College employees and\npostgraduates, is approximately\n17% cheaper than the other Bars. It\nis better presented than the other\nbars but is only open to members;\nit is totally unreasonable that poor\nundergraduate students should\nhave to pay considerably more than\npaid members of staff.\nThe reasoning behind this is\nsupposed to be due to costs of\nrefurbishments, but this is not\naltogether true. Southside is the\nmost expensive bar in College but\nhas not been refurbished for six\nyears. The Holland Club is the\ncheapest bar and is being\ncontinually upgraded. The Union Bar has recently been refer bi shed and the cost of this refurbishment\nis due to be covered in two years at\npre-re fur b turnover rates. This is\nludicrous as it necessitates a dramatic increase in prices. The aim\nof the refurbishment was to make\nthe facilities more attractive to the\nstudents and hence increase trade,\nincreasing prices by 22% does not\nhelp that objective.\nEven though the Union has fouled\nup on its refurbishment, it is saintly\nin comparison to the College in its\nrunning of their bar, Southside. In\n1986, the only year we have reliable\nfigures for, Southside opp e rated at\na gross trading profit of 36% when\nthey were aiming at 40%. This\nmeans that due to bad trading\npractice, not low prices, 4% of the\n\u00a3600K turnover was lost. When the\nUnion discovered that they were\nonly achieving 38% gross profit last\nyear they suspended all the casual\nstaff and reorganised the\nmanagement structure. This drastic\nmeasure not only resulted in the\nUnion reaching its projected profit\nlevel but also succeeded in shocking\nSouthside so much that, according\nto their published accounts, their\nprofits rose for a short period to a level higher than their prices\nsuggested they could ever achieve.\nThe trading figures with which the\ncommittees are ment to make\nmanagement decisions took over six\nmonths to arrive and over the next\nsix months three different figures\nwere produced for the same trading\nperiod. Nobody really knows what\nis going on! The latest accounts\nshow Southside to be operating at\n57.5% gross profit; they project a turnover of \u00a3660K. Southside\nmade a \u00a320K net profit in1986 despite operating at 36% gross\nprofit; this translates into a5% net\nprofit. This year it appears that\nSouthside are aiming at 26.5% net\nprofit. Financially this means that\nCollege are aiming to screw the\nstudents for \u00a3175K in Southside this\nyear.\nSo why doesn't the Union undercut Southside's prices? Firstly,\nthey have the wrong policy towards\nrecouping the costs of the re fur b. Secondly, College won't let them.\nIf the Union tried to undercut\nSouthside the College would cut\nthem out of the joint purchasing\ndeal. The result would be a small\nreduction in the discounts that\nSouthside secures and a massive\nreduction in the Union's discount\nThe Union would lose income from\nreducing prices and would lose\nfurther by the loss of brewers\ndiscounts. It simply can not afford\nthis.\nThe Union's only option if it is not\nto deal with Southside and hope to\nproduce a free market is to join the\nNUS and benefit from its discount\ndeals. This would cost around \u00a330K pa and would have massive political\nrepercussions. A far more sensible\nmove would be for the Union to\nexert its right to Southside Bar as\nlaid down in the by-laws, take it\nover and run it for the students.\nAfter all, we are one of the few\nUnions who do not control all the\ncampus student bars. In 1986 the\nUnion encouraged the students to\nboycott the bars and the outstanding\nsuccess resulted in the Union taking\nover the Union Bar. The strangle\nhold that Southside has over the\nUnion leaves us no choice but to\ntake Southside the same way.\nThe Union Refurbishment.\nThe refurbishment that took place\nin the Union this Summer was\nconceived in its e aries t stages by the\nR SMU Exec with the objective of\nturning the Snack Bar into a more\nsociable place to have a drink in the\nevening whilst traditional ising the\nUnion Bar. The aim was to attract\nmore students to the Unions outlets\nand it was these aims that\npersuaded the Bar Committee and\nlast years Exec to head along the\ncostly road towards refurbishment.\nUnder recommendation from the\nnewly appointed Union Manager a consultant was brought in to\naddress the problem of producing\na flexible trading outlet that could be\nused by the Snack Bar and Bar at the\nsame time. The consultant listened\nto the ideas of a number of people\nin the Union and spat them out in\na form that was totally un student proof and very expensive.\nA second set of plans were drawn\nup by a student Officer (Syd - Ed);\nthese encompassed the general\nopinions of many students and staff\nof the Union including a dais,\npartition, dropped ceiling and fixed\nseating. These plans were generally\nconsidered to be superior to those\nof the commercial consultant. The\nsame student drew up plans for the\nEnts Lounge on similar advice and\nthe Ents Lounge plans were agreed\nand instigated by the House committee.\nAt this point the sabbatical year\nended and this year's sabbaticals\ntook charge. In an effort to impress\nthe new intake with a totally refurbished ground floor, three\ninexperienced and enthusiastic new\nsabbaticals and one enthusiastic and\ninexperienced new Union Manager\nthrew out the student plans and\nnegotiated a new deal with the\noriginal consultants. The deal cost\nabout \u00a330K and cover ted a long, tall,\nstraight, bright, pink and grey\nSnack Bar with comfy fixed seating\ninto a long, tall, straight, bright, red\nand blue Snack Bar without fixed\nseating. At the same time, at almost\ntwice the original verbal quotes, the\nEnts Lounge re fur b was carried out\nthrough the use of different\ncontractors.\nThe newly refurbished Snack Bar\ndoes not have a cosier atmosphere\nto encourage students to stay for a drink. It does have a dropped ceiling\nthat cost \u00a35k but it was only\ndropped 1' 8 \" instead of the 4'\nsuggested. There is no dias, as\nproposed by the Bar Manager. The\nmovable partition that was provided\nwas not only unsuitable as a partition but has already fallen\napart. As for the Union Bar, the new\nfurniture moults pieces of wood of\nleg size dimensions, not seasonally\nbut every day. The objectives of the\nre fur b have been missed altogether\nand the Union is \u00a330K worse off.\nThe sad facts are that the trade\nturnover in the Snack Bar and Bar\nhave not increased and if anything\nthe number of people using the\nSnack Bar has fallen. Part of the\nreason for this was doubtlessly due\nto the astronomical prices proposed\nand instigated at the beginning of\nterm by yet another consultant. The\nSnack Bar food now has nothing like\nthe heavy veggie bias that existed at\nthe beginning of this year and the\nprices are extremely reasonable, but\nthe damage has been done. The\nmain reason must be that the new\nimage of the Snack Bar is no better\nthan the old. The Bar not only has\nno comfy seating but has 22%\nhigher prices: not a very good\nincentive to travel from Princes or\nEvelyn Gardens for a beer. To all\nintents and purposes the Snack Bar\nhas become an evening pool hall\nand very little else. The only saving\ngrace seems to be the increase in entertainments laid on by the Hon Sec (Events).\nThe re fur b in the Ents Lounge, on\nthe other hand, has not fallen apart;\nit has proved extremely successful\nand as a student venue is now\nclaimed to be one of the best in the\nSouth of England. Good praise\nindeed coming from the bands that\nplay there.\nCollege will claim that the Holland\nClub is cheaper than the Union Bar\nbecause it made a \u00a34K net trading\nloss last year. This is only 1.6% of\nthe total turnover of the Club and\ncould be compensated for by an\nequivalent increase in prices. This\ndoes not account for a17% differential. A balance must be\nrestored to the system or the PG membership of the Holland Club\nwill have to terminated.\nFebruary 3 1989\nFELIX\nPage 13\n\n"

Let's face\nit, the mergers bar at the University\nof London Union is a bit of a toilet\nwhen it comes to venues. On free\ngig night it is socially stifling. A home for the hopelessly hip, serious\nhaircuts and sensitive young men\nwhispering of Morrissey and Dosdoevsky. In gig land however,\npopularity is everything and UL U is\ncertainly that. It fields bands\nregularly and draws a regular\ncrowd. Why do people return again\nand again? Why, after being aurally\nassaulted by the likes of the James\nDean Driving Experience do hordes\ncome back? Cheap drink, free live\nmusic or even the company? I think\nit is the hope of seeing the\noccasional gem like Frazier Chorus.\nFrazier Chorus take the title men's room and refurbish it into their very\nown Dream Kitchen. They have a head start on the other bands\nhaving a lead singer who looks like\nDave Gedge but they do have a substance of their own. Tunes of\npure white wipe-clean formica float\nout. Hard to draw analogies with\nother bands for Frazier Chorus are\nmore like your favourite\nSlumberdown than the wild, drug-crazed youth of today. The songs\nain't all soft though, bite through\nthe marshmallow and you find the\nsay mg something-solid centre of raw\nlyric. If you haven't yet heard of\nFrazier Chorus you will, and they're\ngood.\nPerhaps not so endearing are King\nSwamp playing in the concert hall of\nUL U( for money).

Why did they\ntravel to Louisiana to write i conventional rock songs,:\nCricklewood would have sufficed J The lead singer needed to practice\nhis pout and sultry looks, the gee-tar is ts needed to grease their axes to\navoid friction burns and the\nkeyboard man spent some time\nwanting to be in The Mission, going\nbald and bumping into things\nbecause his specs were too dark.\nThey sing songs of riding down\nthe interstate on motorbikes\n(pronounced 'sickles'), leather,\nwomen and, of course, the ballad.\nThe lead singer was visibly pained\nas he uttered the tale he was telling,\nequity card in the post.\nUnfortunately, the biggest music\nmarket in the world, which shall\nremain nameless, laps up exactly\nthis sort of Bon Halen Maiden group\nso they will probably have more\nsuccess (and money) than the\nformer group. No justice.\nSINGLES\nTexas\nI don't want a lover\nIt is a long time since I have had a new single with no centre in it,\nperhaps there is a message in that\nsomewhere. Texas appear to be\nfronted by a female vocalist in the\nstyle of Michelle Shocked, perhaps\nthe oil-state breeds this sort of your\nwoman. I don't want a lover is a plodding four chord strummer that\nbores. It is backed with 'Believe Me' which sounds closer to Michelle\nShocked and is a better song.\nFord Cortina.\nThrashing\nDoves\nJesus on the Payroll\nA twelve inch single of four versions\nof the same song. A soft drum club\nversion, pl inky piano 'street groove' vers on and two normal versions\n(one acoustic). A little excessive\nconsidering the original song isn't too exciting to start with. There are\nshades of James Taylor and Mat.\nJohnson on this record which can't be bad. The Thrashing Doves have\nbeen around a long time and it\nappears th t they still can't get it\nright.\nLada.\nJesus Jones\nLet us Prey\nJesus Jones only managed to fit two\nversions of the same song on their\nrecord. Their energy and live\nperforming arrogance (see next\nweek's gigs) do not come across on\nrecord but still the Wonderstuff in\nthem shines through. This sort of\nconfident noise band are\nconsolidating their position in the\nnew music scene. The best record of\nthis lot.\nA Noisy Chewy\nCOMPETITION Win some funky singles by\nBig Country, Hue and\nCry, Love and Money,\nTexas and others:\nAnswer this, scrawl it on\na scrap of paper and drop\nthe answer into the FELIX\nOffice in Beit Quad:\nhn Curtis was in a band\nwhen he killed himself.\nMich band, and who are\nthey now??\nALBUM\nRush\nShow of Hands\nFollowing last year's superb Hold\nYour Fire tour, Rush have released\nShow of Hands, a double live LP showcasing the material from their\nlast four albums and culled from\ntwo tours.\nThe shows were intensely visual\nincorporating lasers and videos on\na stunning scale, and obviously this\naspect is lost on record for those\nwho were not there. (Although the\nvideo promises to be something\nspecial). However, the music has\nbeen sympathetically mixed to\nproduce a live record of significantly\nhigher quality than normal.\nResisting the practice of\nemploying extra musicians for live\nwork, Geddy Lee uses a complex\nsystem of programmed sy the sizer s to enable him to simultaneously\nplay bass, keyboards and occasional\nrhythm guitar. Backed by Neil\nPeart's phenomenal drumming and\nAlex Lifeson's deft, yet powerful,\nguitar work they produce a sound\nthat has been aptly described as 'a three piece symphony orchestra'.\nIncluded on the LP is much of\nHold Your Fire such as the powerful\nForce Ten and the hit single Time\nStand Still. But the highlights must\nbe on side three which incorporates\nthe menacing Distant Early Warning,\nMystic Rhythms and Witch-hunt in\nwhich Lifeson extracts a spine-tingling cadenza from the top string\nof his guitar. The oldest song\nincluded is the anthem Closer to the\nHeart which stands up well twelve\nyears on, despite sounding as\nthough from earlier phase.\nPeart's indulgent drum solo The\nRhythm Method is the only\ndisappointment but does not detract\nfrom a record that shows how\nnaturally Rush have progressed\nfrom the hippies Fly By Night and\n2112 to make music that is more\narticulate and intelligent than most\nother bands of the heavy rock genre.\nEight out of ten for the music but\nonly four for the sleeve which leaves\nmuch to be desired considering the\nvisual nature of the concerts.\nC.D.

    "content": "in a quote from the Electrical Engineering\nDepartmental Representative: 'After all, Council\nis a more democratic body than aUG M', which\nhe actually seemed to believe.\nA few minutes later, one of the few opponents\nfor the motion inquired how many members of\nCouncil had gained their posts unopposed. Over\nhalf the members present raised their hands.\nIn parallel with this, the Exec were mounting\na totally un foreshadowed attack on FELIX. One\nof the most important freedoms enshrined in the\nConstitutions is the right of the FELIX Editor to\ndetermine the contents of his Newspaper. This\nright has been attacked many times in the past,\nand has stood firm against all challenges. If the\nlast bastion against the power lust of the inner few\nis breached, hope is no more.\nThe meeting was chaired by Neil McClusky,\nalthough at times it was hard to differentiate\nbetween him and the proposer. He ignored\nspeakers whom he disagreed with, and seemed\ntotally incapable of following procedure. At times, the only thing needed to create a High\nFarce was a vicar and a set of French windows.\nTen minutes from Guillotine, the meeting came\nto a vote. Unbelievably, almost the entire Council\nvoted for the proposal that 'abolishing UG Ms is\na good idea'. In true Ian Howgate style, Cosmic\nFerret stormed out of the meeting in disgust, and\nseveral people were very close to following.\nNow is the time for action. A petition form is\nbeing printed at this moment, and will be\ndistributed round the departments. Any help that\nyou can offer will be gratefully received. Don't sit back and ignore the situation\u2014this one will\nmake a difference to you.\nSimon E Spew, Observer.\nDistraught\nDear Bill,\nI write to you as the distraught ICU GM Chairman. I do not even have a seat on Council,\ndid not know what was going on, have made no\nother job plans etc, etc. Now I find that I'm going\nto be out of a job if those faceless hacks have their\nway. Sod democracy, I'm going to be out on my\near! I feel therefore that I must write to complain\nabout the undemocratic and downright sneaky\nway in which all this has been carried on.\nWhen an RCS General Committee discussed\nthe matter, and decided that some sort of senate\ntype body might be a good replacement for\nUG Ms, Steph Snell had carefully planned that\nI would be completely pissed and unable to object\nto the plan. She has since put paid to my naval\npromotion prospects by calling my boss a 'fruit'\nover the phone last week.\nI can now reveal to FELIX readers that this\nwhole U GM business is just a ploy on the RCS President's part to drive me to drink and render\nme destitute. (Fortunately I 've already found the\ndrink, so she can only make me destitute). I must\ninform you that I have a fiancee and overdraft\nto support and cannot take any more of this\nh arras s ment. I shall be taking my plight to the\nnext ICU GM and let the people decide what\nshould be done.\nI can only implore everyone to preserve the\nU GM in order to keep me in a job and keep\nstudent democracy alive at IC.\nYours sincerely,\nDave Burns, IC UGM Chairman,\nRCSU Assistant Honorary Secretary.\nICUIRC\nDear Bill,\nThe ICU Industrial Relations Committee met\nfor the first time last week. One item which we\ndiscussed was our objective to 'help in supplying\nadvertising contracts to ICU publications'. The\nconclusion that we reached will interest and affect\nsome of your readers, and I would be grateful\nfor their comments and suggestions.\nAfter discussion, we concluded that many ICU and C CU publications would like to carry more\nadvertising, but that student editions do not have\nenough time to search for potential advertisers\nand negotiate contracts. We therefore propose,\nas a trial scheme, to employ a student, with\nrelevant experience if possible, to negotiate\nadvertising contracts for these publications. We\nsuggested that our targets should be the ICU and\nC CU handbooks and the Rag Mag, but this is,\nof course, subject to the agreement of the editors.\nI would welcome comments on the desirability\nand feasibility of such a project. Our intention\nis to employ a student for roughly four weeks,\nover the coming Easter vacation. Some work\nwould obviously need to be carried out before\nand after Easter. The end result would be editors\nbeing given adverts to print and cheques from\nadvertisers.\nThe IRC next meets on February 20 and I hope\nto reach a conclusion on this matter, which we\ncan then put into action.\nI look forward to hearing from interested\nparties.\nGavin Spittlehouse,\nICU Industrial Relations Officer.\nAids II\nDear Bill,\nAfter reading Mr Saridakis's letter to FELIX in\nthe last issue I feel it necessary to reply to what\nI think is unjust and naive criticism.\nThe aim of all these 'Welfare Weeks' is to\nprovide information to the students so that he/she\ncan then make up his/her own mind on how to\nreact to such topics as drugs, AIDS, etc. The aim\nof 'AIDS Day' was to make people fully\nunderstand the dangers that AIDS represents to\nhe t ero and homosexuals alike (it is, after all, a huge problem in the States). The idea that the\nwhole thing was 'ludicrous', 'totally irrelevant'\nand 'a shame for Imperial College' I find\nunbelievable! If it has stopped one unwanted\nchild from being born or one drug addict from\ndying of an infected needle or even one person\n(such as myself or Mr Saridakis) being infected\nwith AIDS, then I consider all the hard work well\njustified, and, for your information, no money\nwas spent on organ is ng 'AIDS Day', people put\nthemselves forward free of charge.\nHaving said this, I am glad that Mr Saridakis\ntakes a strong view on Welfare at Imperial. I consider it to be a very important subject, but\nrather than trying to 'oust' anyone, will he not\nrepresent his views more productively by\nstanding for the position of 'ordinary member'\non the Welfare Committee (there are still two\nplaces available). Thus he will also be able to take\npart in some of the work.\nFor those people waiting for the results of last\nLetters\nterm's questionnaires, they are still being\nprocessed free of charge by the data processing\ncompany. However, we should be getting them\nback any day soon and they will be publicised\nalmost immediately afterwards.\nMark Fisher, Union Welfare Officer.\nCCU UGMs\nDear Bill,\n1 would like to congratulate FELIX, IC Radio\nand STOIC on their excellent publicity campaign\nculminating in the unprecedented turnout at\ntoday'sU GM. this was an ideal opportunity for\nthe merger with St Mary's to be discussed and\na workable merger proposal to be passed. It was\nunfortunate then that a lot of people seemed\nunaware that U GM is the means in which the\nExec report on their activities and the students'\nviews are heard. How many times has the order\nof the business changed so that the reports are\nsent to the end and are only heard by the few\nloyal 'hacks' who can be bothered to stay. How many of yesterday's voters have been to aUG M before? I even saw one person turn up as the final\nvote was being taken, ask what was going on and\nthen vote against the motion\u2014lucky he happened\nto drop into the JCR in time! What right has he\nto vote on an issue when he hasn't even bothered\nto listen to the reasons for the motion.\nAt the moment we have the strange situation\nwhere St Mary's students are full members of\nICU and have full voting rights. However the\nreverse is not true and the feelings of IC students\nin Kensington and Silwood have no effect on St\nMary's decisions. We also have the problem that\nin four years time IC will be centrally funded. This\nmeans that all funding for SM HMS SU will come\nfrom ICU. Without a merger we will have no\ncontrol over where that money goes, if St Mary's receive any money at all.\nThe suggestions from the working party\ncovered aspects of the merger from welfare and\naccommodation to the contentious U GM issue.\nSurely some of these proposals were acceptable\nand could have been passed?\nOn the U GM issue, one important point seems\nto have been overlooked. We already have the\nmachinery for holding C CU UG Ms. If the ICU U GM was abolished then the students would\nhave a voice through their C CU. If a motion was\npassed then the C CU representatives to council,\nthe President, Hon Sec, Academic Affairs Officer,\nand the Dep Reps, would be mandated to present\nthe motion at Council, even if they do not agree\nwith what is said. The MSC Chairmen could also\nbe lobbied and the proposer of the motion given\nspeaking rights to ensure that the meaning of the\nmotion is not altered. Surely it would be easier\nto pass a motion through aCC U U GM where a smaller majority is needed. The proposer can still\ncall an EG M( with 150 second ers) if they are not\nsatisfied with Council's decision, or they could\ntake the matter straight to Council if they get 25\nsecond ers. The working party's recommendations will\nprobably come up before another U GM, perhaps\nincluding some of the ideas presented above.\nNext time give the other points made a chance.\nYou can always propose an amendment if you\ndislike what is proposed. I look forward to a rational debate.\nYours,\nChris Home, Elec Eng 2.\nFebruary 3 1989 FELIX Page 3\n\n"

Leaving at 8amI whipped\ndown the South Circular beating the\ncars at the lights all the way and\ndown the A2 for North Kent.\nThrough Rochester and Chatham to\nCanterbury for lunch was no sweat.\nSixty miles still to go, I left\nCanterbury for Margate, still no problem. However, the last 30 miles\nfrom Ramsgate to Wye were hell. I just made it by 9pm. Sheer ecstasy\novercame me; 1002 miles done and\n\u00a3250 for charity and myself having\ncompleted a feat I never expected to\ndo.\nReflections\nAt the speed I went, sightseeing\nwas not much of an option\u2014to do\nthis one can only realistically expect\nto do 50 miles a day\u2014I averaged 120.\nHowever to see most of the country\nby bicycle in9 days is a unique\nexperience\u2014the diversity of the\nBritish countryside is amazing.\nWithout a doubt the Borders were\nmy favourite part\u2014beautiful\ncountryside close to Edinburgh and\nNewcastle which are both great\ncosmopolitan cities with plenty\nhappening.\nAsked if 1 would do such a thing\nagain an emphatic un hesitant yes\nis the answer\u2014London is not a great\nplace for cycling and I miss the\npeace and challenge of a long\ndistance ride through open\ncountryside. However, the crux of\nthe effort is psychological. Physical\nstamina and guts are essential along\nwith knee support bandages, Ralgex\nand painkillers but th? greatest\nan gish is on the mind. The distance\nI covered is peanuts compared to\nthe kind of mileage a professional\nracing cyclist does. However they\nhave good back-up teams and the\nother racers to spur them on. On my\nchallenge there was none of this,\nonly one's own determination to\nkeep going.\nMy final sentence is to say I had\na great time doing it so why not try\nit yourself?\nBy:\nDave\nThomas\nThroughout my time at Imperial a' them and us' situation has prevailed between the three\nsabbaticals in the Union Office and\nthe fourth, responsible for the\nproduction of FELIX. This probably\narose due to differences in opinion\nwhich could not be resolved without\ngoing into battle but it is the\npropagation of this situation that is\nof concern. FELIX takes a lot of time\nto produce, particularly in collating\nand I believe that the group of\npeople who are involved are\nmotivated, on the whole, by\nregarding themselves as constantly\ndefending themselves against\nattempts to restrain editorial\nfreedom. Scandals become\nwatergate s and reporters are\nconstantly fighting the repressive\npower of the Union Office.\nI apologise to the few people in\nthe FELIX Office who do work hard\nto produce balanced reports based\non fact, but they themselves have\nvoiced their opinion that the Editor\nhas actively perverted the facts\npresented to him to produce a 'juicier' FELIX.\nThe end result is that people\nregard FELIX as a pedantic bickering\nschool kid and lose whatever interest\nor positive ideas about what the\nUnion Office exists for, whilst\nreading equally petty replies from its\nOfficers. The activities of the Union\nOfficers supply homegrown material for FELIX, much easier to\ncome by than 'proper' news of\nCollege and the outside world. In a sense the Union Officers are\naccountable to FELIX and anyone\nstanding for a sabbatical post lives\nin fear of a bad word from the\nEditor. The anomaly lies in the fact\nthat the FELIX Editor is the only\nofficer who is not accountable to aUG M. The student body can take\nonly one course of action against the\nEditor and that is to no-confidence\nhim. He cannot be censored or\nmandated to print any particular\nitem.\nAt a recent Council meeting, the\ntime honoured question of Editorial\nfreedom arose and I was disturbed\nto see people skirting around the\nproblem by resolving that the Exec\ncould publish their news on departmental noticeboards and inC CU newspapers rather than by\nmandating the FELIX Editor to print\nup to one page of such news.\nThe present Editor accepted that\nhe would put in Exec news if we\nprovided him with pasted-up,\ncamera-ready page and provide\ncolla tors to insert this page. If\neveryone who ever writes anything\nfor FELIX had to do this, the Editor\nwould have only the Print Unit to\nmanage, but no, other articles are\nokay (with some exceptions). But in\nthis great world of democracy as\nhighly supported in last week's FELIX, the Editor does not feel that\nan Exec News is important enough\nto print without blackmailing us into\ndoing part of his job. If the Editor\nwishes to stay up all night helping\nme with Carnivals, discos, bar\nquiz es, etc, then I will surely stay up\nall night to collate.\nSpeaking of democracy, FELIX\ninsisted (very strangely) that\nstudents should have the right to\ntheir say at aUG M. If UG Ms are\ntherefore so righteous and representative, why does the FELIX\nEditor refuse to be mandated by\none? The other sabbaticals are\nessentially the employees of the\nstudent body, with aUG M as\nManaging Director. The FELIX\nEditor is paid in exactly the same\nway without having to care in any\nway what aUG M tries to make him do.\nNow, why does this attitude\nprevail? It is because the idea of\neditorial freedom must be passed\ndown in some sort of ritual,\nchanting handover ceremony\nduring which the Editors eyes are\nfitted with tunnels and he smears\nhis loyal helpers with the blood of\na virgin cat.\nSo what should be done? At present things aren't desperate.\nThere is a working relationship\nbetween myself and the Editor,\nalthough this might not prevail in future times. A major point is the\nExec News. It might be wise for the\nFELIX Editor to agree to print up to\none page of Exec News every\nfortnight, this agreement to be\nreviewed at Joint Council each year.\nHis failure to do this might lead to\na constitutional change to make the\nEditor accountable to aUG M.I apologise to those of the FELIX\nstaff that I do respect as doing a very\ngood job and I hope that the Editor\ndoes not see this as a personal\nattack. If there are any factual\ninaccuracies, please don't write in,\nit is the gist that I want to promote\nnot small details.\nPage 8 FELIX February 3 1989\n\n"

The answers could be many\nbut in my case it was to raise money\nfor the Christian Charity Tearfund\nwho fund long term development\nprojects in developing countries.\nEquipment\nOf paramount importance to such\na feat is a good reliable mach in emine is a Peugeot Ranger 10 gear\nMountain Bike\u2014puncture less and in\ngood working order, having done\n3000 miles in7 months. Only an\nidiot would not train in advance of\nsuch a feat. However flash training\nschedules are not required. The best\ntraining is cycling itself. I did several\nruns from London to Kent and back\n(60 miles each way) some hill work\nand some sprint work build ling up\nthe stamina and the appropriate\nmuscles. However,as I was to\ndiscover, more important than\ntraining is sheer guts and determination. To make life as easy\nas possible it is advisable to carry the\nbare minimum amount of luggage.\nPersonally I prefer a rucksack to\npanniers and carried less than 151bs. Essential is a good full first aid kit\nand the odd Mars Bar as iron\nrations. Otherwise just a few tee-shirts, a jumper, socks, lock for the\nbike, tool kit for the bike and wooly\nhat, gloves, a few polythene bags\nand a monsoon proof set of\nwaterproofs.\nThe Journey\nSo I set out on Friday July 22 at\n1.30pm from Wye in Kent and\nstarted on the most physically\nchallenging experience of my life.\nThis was an easy afternoon, a quick\n65 miles to Barnes through pleasant\ncountryside with no technical\nproblems bar pain from the rucksack. This was soon remedied\non reaching Barnes.\nLeaving Barnes at 7.45a mona dismal Saturday morning my next\nstop was Newport in Cheshire\u2014170\nmiles. The trip to Aylesbury was\nslow. However the 40 miles from\nAylesbury to Banbury whistled by;\nI had made 85 miles by lunch thus\nreaching the beautiful market town\nof Banbury which to my surprise\nhas the best jam doughnuts in the\ncountry. Thus replenished 1 continued up\nthe A41 through Warwickshire to\nBirmingham. To my mind Birmingham is a horrible soulless\nplace, the least pleasant place 1\nvisited on the entire journey (sorry\nb rum mies). Needless to say I sped\nthrough Birmingham as fast as\npossible\u2014especially Handsworth\u2014\non through Wolverhampton to\nmake Newport by 10pm. Despite\nroughing it on the verge of the A41\nI had a good night's sleep.\nWith no tent one may wonder\nhow I roughed it. Simple\u2014I wore all\nthe clothes I had; my waterproofs,\nwooly hat, s carve and gloves and\nplastic bags on my feet (I cycled in\nsandals, personally finding them\nmore comfortable than anything\nelse!). My pillow was the rucksack.\nUp at 5amon Sunday to hit\nLancaster (120 miles). At this point\nI had no iron rations and I therefore\nhad to cycle for 4 hours until I got\nany breakfast at the first shop I found open. At this stage my backside started to feel painful, a recurring problem from this point\non. This proved to be an uneventful\nday of reasonable progress reaching\nLancaster and a friend's house by\nmid afternoon. Thus repleted I headed off rather\nlate the next morning (9am) to hit\nScotland. The A6 and skirting the\nlakes were no problem as there was\ngood weather on the pass and a spectacular view. Lunch was in\nPenrith which was the most scenic\ntown I passed through. The ride\nto Carlisle was easy but on passing\nover the River Esk and onto Gretna\nGreen I hit40 mile an hour cross winds and was forced to walk\nalong the A74 for 3 miles. That night\nwas to prove to be the worst of all.\nI spent it just outside Beatock. It was\na blustery wet cold night in which\nI initially slept in the churchyard\nwhere, on feeling unsafe, I slept just\noff the A74\u2014I got two hours sleep.\nOn Tuesday I was intending to\ntravel via Glasgow to Edinburgh but\ndue to my lack of sleep and the poor\nweather I took the direct route to\nEdinburgh via Biggar. I left Beatock\nat 4.30am and nit Edinburgh at\n10am. Here I did some sightseeing\nfor a few hours then crashed for the\nrest of the day in a friend's flat.\nWednesday I decided to make up\na bit of mileage and cycled 50 miles\naround Edinburgh and the\nsurrounding districts. That evening\nCo-ordination is important\nI was taken to the Lorre Mans,\nundoubtedly one of the best pubs in\ntown with sheet music covering the\nwalls the whole place having the\nappearance of an Aladin's cave and\nwhisky being \u00a31 a shot (\nV4 gill!).\nI had now completed 550 miles,\nnothing was going to stop me now\u2014or so I thought.\nSo on Thursday I headed South\nthrough the Borders to Newcastle.\nThe Border's were heavy with\ndrizzle\u2014my average progress was\ndown to 7 miles an hour with heavy\nreliance on the low gears. The only\nmain town you pass through is\nJedburgh\u2014built like a fortress. At7 pm30 miles from Newcastle\u2014my\nnext intended stop\u2014my gear cable\nsnapped, there was no way I could\nmake it to Newcastle so I walked\nback 2 miles to the village of\nOtterburn a few miles inside\nEngland. Here there were 3 hotels\nand by Sod's law all were full bar\nthe most expensive. However I was\nsoaked and spending a night out in\nthe continually bad weather was a guaranteed method of obtaining\nhypothermia. However, Northerners being a friendly breed\u2014an\nevening in the bar was pleasant and\na hot bath and warm bed and\ncooked breakfast a good start for the\nnext day.\nFriday saw me hobbling 30 miles\nto Newcastle in5 th gear where the\nbike was repaired and serviced for\na mere \u00a32. After lunch I bombed it\ndown the A19 and A64 to York\nstopping in Thirsk for Fish and\nChips\u2014the best in the country\n(those in Edinburgh were foul).\nYork proved to be a problem in itself. I wanted to crash out in a held\nsouth of York but did not realise I could go via the un labelled by-pass.\nThe centre of York has no traffic\nsigns at all\u2014I spent half an hour\ntrying to find my way out of the\nplace\u2014it seemed to have an active\nnightlife though.\nA few hours kip in a field and I sped it down through mundane\ncountryside to Grantham. Sped is\nan exaggeration\u2014my progress was\nseverely hampered by bad back and\nbum pain that had to be suppressed\nby painkillers, only grit\ndetermination keeping me going. At\nGrantham 1 caught a train to Kings\nCross and then cycled to\nWimbledom and another bed for the\nnight. I knew that on my last day\nFebruary 3 1989 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
