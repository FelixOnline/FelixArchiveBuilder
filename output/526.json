    "content": "WHY NOT STAY FOR BREAKFAST\nStarring George Chakiris & Gemma Craven\nWhy not stay for breakfast (A) Soon enough a film had to be based\non the hit stage comedy 'Why not stay\nfor breakfast' - and here it is-. The original\nscript for stage was written by Gene\nStone and Ray Cooney, the screenplay\nwas written by the producer, Terrance\nMarcel in collaboration with Cooney,\nand under the latter s influence the film\nhas retained a stage atmosphere.\nGeorge (played by George Chakiris)\nis a fussy, forty ish batch el or, whose life\nis concerned with thirties music and\npot plants, and only complicated by the\npresence of his sister, Helen (Yvonne\nWilder) a professional hypochondriac.\nBut Georgies well-ordered life is\nshattered one evening by the loud rock\nmusic emanating from the apartment\nabove, followed by a knock. Standing\nthere is Louise (Gemma Craven), a girl\nwho is to play an important part in\nGeorge's life.\nIt is refreshing to find an English actor\nplaying a major role in an American film,\nshe has been seen previously in the\nBBC's highly acclaimed series 'Pennies\nfrom Heaven'. She played the part of a young girl very well, especially in\novercoming the transition from being\nplump and pregnant to becoming a slender mum.\nGeorge Chakiris is well known from\nhis Oscar winning performance in\n'West-side story', working with Yvonne\nWilder (who played Helen). Both played\nthe parts well, especially in the\nexecution of the comedy periods.\nOn the whole the film is very amusing,\nbut I think it is directed towards a more\nmature audience and could prove very\nboring to people who expect constant\nhumerous entertainment.\nNick Grattan\nCARA\nI feel that the plot in this film is typical\nof so many films to be found in the BBC archives and shown on Sunday afternoons. Basically the plot involves\nMark Miller (played by Michael Sarrazin)\ntravelling to contra l Asia to find Ellen\nJasper (Jennifer O 'Neill), the wayward\ndaughter of a US Senetor. Of course she\nhas met and married an influential local,\nColonel Nazrullah (Behrooz Vosoughi).\nHe is the Nephew of Sardar Khan\n(Christopher Lee). Miller gets captured\nby two Bedouins who take him to\nVAN (A) Zalfigar (Anthony Quinn) and his camel\ncaravan. The plot then develops along a well trodden path.\nAll of the film was set on location in\nIran, and was the last film to come out of\nIran before the revolution. The\ngrandiose scenery (see stills opposite)\nalleviate the boredom and gives the film\na great visual impact, perhaps the best\nreason for seeing this film. Also shown\nin the stills are the three main actors\ndownwards they are; Michael Serrazin\n(as Mark Miller, Jennifer O 'Neill (as\nEllen Jasper) and Anthony Quinn (as\nZulfiger).\nAnthony gave a good performance as\nZulfiger, a nomad who captures Miller.\nHe showed his experience and therefore\nlooked the most professional, perhaps\nto the detriment of the other actors.\nOn the technical side both the filming\nand sound were of a high stand. I noted\nthat the directions were aimed more\ntowards the scenery and away from the\nactors, giving the actors a most difficult\njob in competing with the breath taking\nsc energy. The film is due for general\nrelease in December.\n6\n\n"

    "content": "Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the Admiral\nof the Fleet, was murdered on August 28th by an I.R.A. bomb which exploded on his\nboat \" Shadow V.\" His grandson Nicholas,\naged fourteen, and a seventeen-year-old\nboatman were also tragically killed, and his\ndaughter's mother-in-law the Dowager\nLady Brabourne died later in Sligo\nhospital.\nMountbatten and his family were on their\nannual visit to his Irish home, Classiebawn\nCastle, which is twelve miles from the\nborder with Northern Ireland. At the time of\nthe explosion, the boat was in\nMull a gh more harbour, and local people\nover a mile away heard the roar of the\nexplosion. Many expressed surprise that\nthere were any survivors at all, because the\nboat disintegrated completely. A trade\nunion official from the area summed up the\ngeneral public's reaction with \"What they\n(the IRA) do in the name of Ireland makes\nme ashamed to be called an Irishman.\"\n\"At its heart,\nfor all the\nceremonial, it\nwas a family\nfuneral for a man who was\nmurdered\"\nto Lord Mountbatten\nDAY BY DAY\nSPECIAL FEATURE\nWRITTEN BY\nJILL DAWSON\nPHOTOS BY\nCOLIN PALMER\nThe seventy-nine year old Earl had had a dazzling and varied career.\nIn July, 1965, he retired as Chief of the\nDefence Staff, and was made a member of\nthe Order of Merit. He was the last Viceroy\nof India and the first Governor-General of\nthe new Dominion, now the Republic.\nHe served in the Royal Navy during both\nworld wars, where his personal charm and\npowers of leadership gained him much admiration - as an able seaman who had\nserved under him put it \" Lord Louis was\nsomething special. We would have\nfollowed him to helland back.\" A great-grandson of Queen Victoria and\nan uncle of Prince Philip, he was born at\nFrogmore House, Windsor in 1900. By\n1916 he had passed through Osborne and\nDartmouth, and during the first World War\nhe served on H.M.S. Lion, H.M.S. Queen Elizabeth and in submarines. After the war, Mountbatten specialised\nin radio communications, and invented a device enabling ships to keep station\nwhich became standard in the Royal Navy.\nHe became Fleet Wireless Officer of the\nMediterranean Fleet in 1931, and in 1937\nwas promoted as youngest captain.\nDuring the early part of the second World War, he commanded HMS Kelly and\nthe Fifth Destroyer Flotilla. At this time he\nhad the unique honour of holding the\nranks of Acting Vice-Admiral, LieutenantGeneral and Air Marshal simultaneously.\nIn the summer of 1943, he was appointed\nSupreme Commander in South East Asia.\nHe conducted a campaign described by Sir\nWinston Churchill as \"the greatest\ncollision which has yet taken place on land\nwith Japan.\" The surrender of Japanese troops followed the dropping of atomic\nbombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nWhen it was decided in 1947 to grant\nindependence to India, Mountbatten was\nentrusted with the task of transfering\npower.\nAfter leaving India in 1948, he was\npromoted Vice-Admiral in 1949, Admiral in\n1953 and Admiral of the Fleet in 1956.\nHe was made a Viscount in 1946, and\nEarl Mountbatten and Baron Romsey in\nthe following year.\nIn recent years, Mountbatten has helped\nraised large sums of money for children's charities, working with organisations such as the Variety Club. The Queen led the nation's mourning at\nthe Earl's funeral service, which took place\nin Westminster Abbey on September 5th. It\nwas a solemn and moving occasion, full of\nthe pageantry and ceremonial that\nMountbatten had loved so much. The\nAbbey was filled with one thousand four\nhundred people, including every member\nof the Queen's family and many foreign\nkings and princes who had come to pay\ntribute to the murdered Earl, to whom so\nmany were related.\nAlso present were two hundred veterans\nof Burma and a contingent of survivors\nfrom HMS Kelly, which was sunk off Crete\nin 1941. Many in the congregation were on\na list drawn up by Lord Mountbatten of\nBurma himself.\nIn the procession, which followed the\ncoffin to -the Abbey, marched Prince\nCharles and Prince Philip in full naval\nuniform, men of the Burma Star Association, Marine Commandos representing France, Life Guards, men of\nthe King Edward VM's Own Gur kha Rifles,\nand Mountbatten's charger Dolly, with the\nEarl's boots reversed in the stirrups.\nThe coffin itself was borne on a Royal\nNavy gun carriage pulled by sailors.\nTremendous dignity and control was\nshown, throughout the ceremony, by the\nRoyal Family whose sense of loss at the\noutrageous killing of the man they knew as\n\" Uncle Dickie\" is shared by the whole\nnation, grieving at the death of \"so rare a man.\" The insignia carried in the procession were: The Garter Cushion, The GCB Cushion (Knight\nGrand Cross of the Bath), The GCSI Cushion (Knight Grand Commander of the Star of\nIndia), The GCIE Cushion (Knight Grand Commander of the Indian Empire), The GCVO\nCushion (Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order) and The Burmese Cushion.\n\n"

It is also proposed to curb Union\ncontrol over their funds from LEA's. Due partly to claims of misappropriation of funds by left-wing leaders,\n( including giving cash to such organizations as the IRA) the\nGovernment is considering removing\ncontrol of about \u00a320M from the Unions\nby giving the choice whether or not to\njoin college unions.\nThe Bow Group issued a statement\nsaying 'closed shop student unionism is\nincompatible with a free society\nAutomatic membership gives monopoly rights to a single student\nunion in a university. We consider such a monopoly to be highly undesirable'.\nIn the editorial under the heading\nleader 'The closed Quad' in The Daily\nTelegraph (Wed, August 29) the editor\nwrote 'Part of the problem is that in most\ninstitutions of further education the\nstudent's unions operate facilities such\nas bars and rest u rants. There is no\nlogical reason why they should do so:\nat Oxford and Cambridge these facilities\nare operated by the colleges themselves, and the students are not\nnotably deprived thereby.'\nThe unions have also been critized for\nsustaining full time' officials'( sabbaticals) for years on end claiming\nthat 'long suffering' LEA's are at present\nrequired to pay for perpetual students.\nThe example of Trevor Phillips, president of NUS is given.\nFor the NUS Dave Aaronovitch (the\nnational treasurer) said: 'Voluntary\nmembership could create the conditions\nthat would turn unions in elitist bastions\nof extremism, exactly opposite to the\nintention of the Bow Group'. Concerning the allegations of misa p pro pri ation of funds aNUS spokesman said ' they' are un war rented scare mongering. They're completely\nuntrue'.\nThere have also been rumours that the\nmeans tested grant system may be\nphased out with the introduction of a loan scheme, as is the case in the USA.\nUnder this scheme the government\nwould loan money to students and\nwould have to be payed back at a later\ndate. Such a scheme is planned to make\nthose students who em migrate soon\nafter graduation pay for their education.\nPrinters refuse to print Rag Mag\nThe Rag Mag has been rejected by the\nprinters because of its' obscene content.\nThe, not unexpected, news was greeted\nby comments of ' I told you so' from\nstudents who had previewed the\nmagazine.\nThe printers are trying to find another\nfirm to take on the job of printing the Rag\nMag. They hope that other units will be\nless sensitive to the content of Steve\nMarshall's latest work.\n\n"

I cannot thank him enough for his help\nwith this issue of FELIX.\nThis is the last FELIX before the\nFresher's Edition. My hopes are that\nFELIX will contain a large number of\nphotos next year. I can only run a good selection of pic s with the help of many\nphotographers. If you would like to get\ninvolved in FELIX please come into the\noffice at any time.\nNews coverage of major events such\nas the funeral of Lord Mountbatten\ncould have created a very serious air to\nthis issue of FELIX. Mountbatten\nwanted us to be happy at his funeral\nand so to balance the events covered in\nthe centre pages the FELIX news team\nwent to the Great British Beer Festival.\nThe Beer was good and cheap. I could\nknock our college Bar prices in this\neditorial but to-day has shown\npromising developments in this area.\nWe can help cut down Beer prices by\nreturning glasses to the Bars and a major campaign is about to be\nlaunched on this subject.\nThe copy deadline for the Fresher's FELIX is next Monday.

This is surely highlighted by the annual\nGreat Beer Festival held at Alexander Palace. Since the first\nfestival in 1977 the attendances have greatly risen, as have the\nnumber of brewers and types of ale.\nThe beer was found to be in good condition (and more\nimportant - high in alcohol content). It was found that on the\nFriday night many of the ales were 'off, the remaining beer\nbeing left for the final day. When some bystanders (just!) were\nasked on which day it was best to go the answer given was\n'every day'. Unfortunately FELIX would not take this advise!\nFor those not drinking (alot) there was the possibility to lose\nmoney playing impossible pub games, including darts on a Manchester clock board and the Bat and trap. Live music was\nalso presented, unfortunately this was usually too\noverwhelming. For those who enjoy a good pint it was well\nworth a visit, as can be seen by these happy faces!\nThe Acting FELIX editor relaxes at the\nBeer Festival\n\n"
