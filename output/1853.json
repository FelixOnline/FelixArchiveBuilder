    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n8 | FILM&TV 11 october 2024\nY\nou\u2019ve probably heard of The Substance. The body\nhorror, written and directed by Coralie Fargeat,\nstarring Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley has\nbeen a topic of discussion ever since its premiere at the\nCannes Film Festival in May. It has garnered headlines\nafter leading to theatre walkouts due to its graphic\ncontent and has been labeled as misogynistic overkill\nby critics. However, it has been embraced with open\narms by many others, who feel that the film\u2019s blunt and\nexplicit tone is exactly what gives it nuance.\nThe story follows Elisabeth Sparkle (Moore), the\nmiddle-aged host of a popular daytime fitness show,\nwho is introduced to the Substance after discovering\nthat she is about to lose her job to a younger woman.\nThose who inject themselves with the Substance grow\na younger version of themselves from within their own\nbody. They can exist as their \u201calternate\u201d for a week at\na time, before they must revert and live as their older\nself for a week. Failure to adhere comes with a price.\nThe two share a consciousness but cannot be awake\nat the same time. Most importantly, one cannot exist\nwithout the other: they are one. Elisabeth\u2019s alternate,\nSue (Qualley), eventually replaces her as the host of\nher TV show, and resentment starts to grow between\nthem. As Sue begins to feel that one week at a time\nisn\u2019t enough, she starts taking liberties at Elisabeth\u2019s\nexpense. This leads to rising tensions that eventually\nspiral out of control as Elisabeth begins to deteriorate\nmore and more with each transition while Sue becomes\nincreasingly disgusted by how Elisabeth spends her\nweek.\nBoth Moore and Qualley, along with Dennis Quaid,\nwho plays the effortlessly unlikable executive Harvey,\ngive stellar performances. The casting in this film is\nincredibly intentional. Moore, with a career spanning\nover 40 years, is no stranger to having her appearance\nscrutinised by the tabloids. I would bet money that she\nhas been told by men that she is \u201cpast her prime\u201d. She\nis no longer young enough, sexy enough, profitable\nenough. Qualley, on the other hand, is. And, like\nSue, she has probably found herself in rooms full of\npowerful, wealthy men, who can do nothing but gawk\nat her and tell her to smile. These characters are rooted\nin their reality.\nVisually, the film is stunning. Benjamin Kra\u010dun,\nthe cinematographer, does an amazing job of bringing\nElisabeth\u2019s overly saturated reality to life. Her egg-yolk\nyellow jacket serves as a reminder of how ridiculous\nthis all is. Anyone would look silly wearing it. Moments\nof comedy like this help in keeping up the pace of the\nfilm, taking the edge off the more gory scenes. And\nthere are far too many gory scenes in this film.\nI would like to clarify that some graphic scenes\nwere necessary. I would strongly advise those with an\naversion to needles and sutures to not watch the film,\nbut scenes showing the injection of the Substance\nwere done tastefully and had the intended effect. I\nwas uncomfortable but intrigued. Towards the end of\nthe film, when we had seen enough blood and decayed\nbody parts, it started to become overkill. While you\ncould find it refreshing that female pain is not being\nromanticised for once, after the initial shock value\nwears off these scenes do nothing to develop ideas or\nthe plot further. Their comical nature is the only saving\ngrace towards the end of the 2 hour 20 minutes movie.\nI\u2019m not going to say that I personally found them\ntedious, but I understand why someone else would.\nThey distract from the essence of the film, which is\nabout a lonely woman, who does something desperate,\nand it backfires on her \u2013 and this isn\u2019t emphasised\nenough.\nThe Substance is a movie that tells us a lot about where\nwe are now. It\u2019s brazen, blunt, and offers no solutions.\nIt is a mirror and a rabbit hole. Setting the movie in\nHollywood, where a woman\u2019s body and youth is her\nlivelihood, raises the stakes even higher. But it removes\nElisabeth Sparkle further from reality. Personally, I\ncan\u2019t see all of myself in Elisabeth, but I can see enough\nof myself in her to be scared. Everybody has done stupid\nthings in order to be liked. Everybody has made rash\ndecisionsthattheyhaveendedupregretting,albeitwith\nmuch less dire consequences. But with the same sense\nof urgency, and the same inflated sense of importance.\nHowever, I know that, unlike Elisabeth, I have people\nin my life who really love me. She was alone when she\nmade the decision to take the Substance, she had no one\nto challenge her, no one she thought would miss her.\nThat was ultimately what led to her demise.\nAfter the movie ended, I left the cinema with the\ndesire to look after myself. To do my morning stretches,\ntake my vitamins, and reconnect with friends from my\nchildhood. I don\u2019t want to become bitter and resentful\nwhen I\u2019m older, but I also don\u2019t want to spend my youth\nworrying about that. I truly believe that Elisabeth\u2019s\nfate would have been different if she knew who she\nwas and had good people around her. It\u2019s a pretty crazy\ntakeaway from a film with that much blood and nudity\nand Dennis Quaid. To me, that\u2019s its beauty.\nThe Substance\nFILM&TV\nAn unapologetically distasteful look at the price\nof youth, vanity, and identity, that asks how far\nyou would go for adoration.\nFilmWriter\nJYOTSANA DASOONDI\nThese characters are rooted in\ntheir reality.\n\u201c\n\n"

Rugby\nand Netball had already claimed their\nterritory within the Union bar, and when\nI first managed to squeeze into the tiny\nroom, already filled to beyond capacity by\nRugby in the middle, and Netball cooped\noff in the side, it was beginning to get\nrowdy, although rugby players familiar\nwiththematterdidcommentthat\u2018it\u2019snot\neven started yet\u2019. Many were beginning\nto get inebriated by the megapints they\ntended to drink but were still conscious\nenough to comment on the night ahead.\nWhen asked about the night, one rugby\nmember said it was \u2018exciting\u2019.\nOutside the bars, there was more lively\nactivity. Members of a group claiming to\nbe from SOAS Orienteering were willing\nto be interviewed. Felix is unsure how\nthey managed to get in. \u2018So, for me\u2026 I\ndescribe ACC [Athletic Clubs Committee]\nor Sports Night as a girl, and when I talk\nto her, I feel amazing\u2019. Said one member\nsmoking outside. Ben James, another\nmember from SOAS orienteering said\nthey would sum up sports nights with\n\u2018one word: mega-Carling.\u2019\nFelix was able to find a singular first\nyear willing to talk about their first time\nat the event. \u2018It\u2019s a wild night, I\u2019m scared\nto tell them it\u2019s my birthday\u2019.

A female\nmember from hockey was kind enough\nto be interviewed on the dancefloor:\n\u2018join hockey to meet your future partner,\nhousemate or best friend\u2019. When\npressed on the partner bit of her pitch\n(and whether hockey is incestuous, she\nclarified: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t call it incestuous, I\nwould call it fate. I would call it like, you\nmeet your best friends, and they might\nbe more than that\u2019. When asked if she\nhad met a partner through hockey, the\nclub member said: \u2018not a relationship\u2019.\nSome enthusiastic sports club\nmembers wore costumes. Two netball\nteam members were dressed as a can\nof Stella Artois, and a pack of Marlboro\nGold (British cancer warning). Another,\nseparate, anonymous source familiar\nwith this matter clarified that it was\nbecause they were dressed as things\nmen abuse. Other women, of unknown\nclubs, were dressed as the Teletubbies, or\nsporting fake facial hair.\nBy 10pm, our roving reporter had\nto head home, but the night was only\nbeginning.

We\u2019ve\ncut down the number of textboxes, reduced the music\nquestions to genres (The Weeknd is everyone\u2019s favourite\nsex artist, we get it), and added a few more questions to\nactually improve our understanding of the sex lives of\nImperial students, especially when Generation Z appear\nto be having less sex than their preceding generations.\nCoincidentally, we\u2019ve timed our survey to have the\nresults released around Valentine\u2019s Day, as it originally\noccurred during its conception, under the tenure of Editorin-Chief Kadhim Shubber. Shubber, who now works as\nUK editor at the FT (see Felix 1827) launched it as a bit of\n\u201clight-hearted\u201d fun, which swelled in the 2010s to become\nmuch larger than it is today. There have been times where\nwe have had to stop the sex survey, with a four year draught\nmost recently between 2020 and 2024, but it\u2019s very much\na Felix tradition at this point, and in an era where traditions\nacross the College are dying out, not least the tradition of\nhaving a University experience, it\u2019s important to carry on\nthose traditions that at least get people to pick up their\ncopy on a Friday morning, and at most, provide the people\nwho go to this miserable institution with some laughter\nand a topic to talk about.\nRough Rankings\nThis week Times Higher Education (THE) launched\ntheir world ranking list for 2025. What\u2019s interesting to see\nis that in both The Times and Times Higher Education,\nwe saw a drop in rankings for Imperial, compared to a\nmassive jump in the QS world rankings.\nThe Daily Mail rankings don\u2019t count because it\u2019s a shit\nrag- Wikipedia stopped using it as a source in 2017, and\nits reputation in the UK is rock bottom, because it\u2019s quite\nshoddy, even for a tabloid- this would be true regardless\nof its political leanings (it's quite right-wing). The Mail, on\nbalance does have some decent enough coverage, but\nit wouldn\u2019t be unfair to say that most of its pages aren't.\nIt was curious to see Imperial, with its new strategy of\n\u201cScience for Humanity\u201d, and all the altruistic connotations\nit has, proudly touting the fact the Mail\u2019s rankings on its\nsocial media when the College topped the list earlier this\nsummer. It\u2019s even funnier when, looking at the calibre and\ntype of student Imperial attracts- who would more likely\nread The Economist or the Financial Times, the Daily Mail\nwould have no real bearing on their choice to apply. Oh\nwell, a win is a win, especially when the more prestigious\nlistings from The Times saw it drop in rank.\nLooking at the methodologies each system uses,\nit\u2019s interesting to see the difference in priority. QS, which\npublicises its weightings and rankings, focuses more on\nresearch and the quality of academic, whereas THE gets\nprofessionals in its voting groups to nominate universities\nbased on its teaching and research separately, whereas\nThe Times focussed this time on student experience,\nincluding free speech and student satisfaction, along\nwith an increased weighting on sustainability. All three\nhave their strengths and weaknesses, but ultimately for\nundergrads, and taught postgrads, there is really only\none list they should focus on. Research means nothing\nwhen you have to wait ages for some poor overworked\nacademic to mark your summative assessments.\nEDITORIAL\nEditor-in-Chief\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\nAn announcement for the inaugural Sex Survey.

This protest was the\nfourth they have enacted against the Museum and Adani Green Energy partner-ship.\nThe protest was held because the \u201ctrustees have their quarterly meeting today\u201d,\nsaid the activist. The group has also delivered a petition with 10,000 signatures\nrequesting the Science Museum drop\nAdani Green Energy as its sponsor.

This\nsummer, I sat down to read the 768-page-long series of journal entries titled The\nUnabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath. This\nedition is supposedly the most complete\nversion of her journals, offering a direct\nwindow into her life.\nI told my best friend (an equally, if\nnot more, avid admirer of Plath\u2019s work\n\u2013 demonstrated by her choice to write\nher 4000-word extended essay on Ariel,\nPlath\u2019s most renowned poetry collection)\nabout starting the book. In her usual\ncontemplative manner, she asked me if\nI thought reading Plath\u2019s journals was an\nintrusion into the deceased author\u2019s pri-vacy.\nI pondered about it in relation to my\nown experience. My diary is unequivocally personal \u2013 a snapshot of my innermost thoughts spanning fragments of\nmy life, utterly candid, and absolved of\nrestraint. The thought of someone reading my journal, dead or alive, makes me\nrather queasy. Why shouldn\u2019t the same\nhave applied to Plath?\nThe deeper I got into Plath\u2019s journals,\nthe more I gained conviction that they\nwere not for millions of strangers to see.\nThey read like butter. Plath\u2019s language,\noverwhelming and intimate, spanning\nyears without a plot, are pages upon\npages of mastery. I often found myself\nuneasy, disturbed both by her ennui and\nmy fluttering jealousy of her craft. Yet I\ncouldn\u2019t bring myself to stop.\nA question of consent\nLess than halfway through the book, I\narrived at the paradox that underlies any\npublished autobiographical work. To be\nan authentic, unfiltered version of the\nauthor\u2019s thoughts, the journals must be\nwritten without any intention of them\nbeing published.\nFranz Kafka\u2019s last wishes were clear: he\nwanted his diaries, letters, manuscripts\nand drawings to be burned. Many were\npublished posthumously. This issue remains relevant today and extends beyond literature. Mac Miller\u2019s unfinished\nmusic continues to be released after his\ndeath, while Tyler, The Creator stated in\nhis will that he will not allow his incomplete work to be released after he dies.\nThe simple truth is that we will never\nknow if Plath wanted her journals to be\npublished. This uncertainty is central to\nthe ethical dilemma of reading The Unabridged Journals. Can Plath\u2019s work be\nrightfully appreciated if reading it feels\nlike an act of voyeurism?\nTruth vs misconception\nThe journals may bring truth to the\ncomplexity of Plath\u2019s life. In certain in-stances, you see the vagaries of Plath\u2019s\nthoughts; in others, you see her as a\nproduct of the society in which she was\nraised. These entries unravel the ambiguity of her literary ambitions and her\nideas of life as a woman, wife, and moth-er. Though many people confound the\nmentally ill protagonist Esther Greenwood from her 1963 novel The Bell Jar\nwith Plath herself, the diaries may aid in\nseparating the person from the persona.\nDespite this, Plath\u2019s young suicide remains a subject of speculation. The book\nis missing entries from her final two\nyears, which Ted Hughes, her widower,\nadmitted to destroying under the pretext\nof protecting their children. The destruction of her journals only deepens the\nscrutiny and misconceptions surrounding what drove her to a tragic end. This\nraises critical questions about who controls Plath\u2019s legacy \u2013 and now that she is\ngone, who reaps its benefits?\nHistory or art?\nDisregarding the moral argument,\nsome value Plath\u2019s journals purely as a literary masterpiece. I certainly sympathise\nwith that.\nHowever, the issue arises with an incorrect expectation of biographical material (which this text fundamentally\nis): conflating art with a record of raw\nthoughts and emotion. Far too many reviews dismiss The Unabridged Journals\nas boring, complaining about Plath\u2019s\nnavigation of societal expectations or\ndismissing her as anti-feminist. But the\nwork shouldn\u2019t tarnish Plath\u2019s reputa-tion, and no one should be rebuked for\nwriting down their private thoughts.\nSo, who has the right to know?\nThe diaries evidence Plath as a devas-tatingly complicated individual, as with\nany human being. They shed light on\nsome of her shades of grey, but certainly\nonly a fraction.\nIt can be argued that the diaries hu-manise Plath, giving her depth beyond\n\u2018the writer who stuck her head in an\noven\u2019. Yet it is equally dehumanising for\nher most vulnerable moments to be laid\nbare without her permission.\nUltimately, I find myself asking who \u2013\nif anyone \u2013 has the right to know? Does\nthe mere fact that a public figure is \u2018public\u2019 grant people the right obsess over\ntheir private lives?\nThere is no point in wondering if we\nwill ever really know Plath. The real\nquestion is whether our misguided quest\nfor understanding leads to an irrevocable\nviolation of another\u2019s privacy.\nPrivate Pages,\nPublic Ethics\nBooksEditor\nADITI MEHTA\nBooks editor, Aditi, questions\nthe morality of reading\nposthumourously published work.\nCan Plath\u2019s work be\nrightfully appreciated\nif reading it feels like\nan act of voyeurism?\n\u201c\nMortimer Rare Book Room, Smith College, Massachusetts Eleanor Freidmann Klein\n\n"

Despite the sheer chaos that\nfolloweduptotheevents,wherewedidn\u2019t\nhave our tickets nor hotels confirmed, we\nfound the entire trip and events ran with\nrelative ease. My friends and I attended\nthe Men\u00b4s 50m Freestyle Final, Women\u00b4s\n200m Backstroke Final, Men\u00b4s 200m\nIndividual Medley Final, Men\u00b4s 100m\nButterfly Semi-finals and Women\u00b4s\n200m Individual Medley Semi-finals.\nWe also saw the warm-ups, the athletes\nwhom the camera did not film and all the\nother behind-the-camera movements,\nwhich highlighted the vast\norganisational requirements behind the\nplanning of the events.\nEntry and merchandise\nThe Paris La D\u00e9fense arena, which\nhosted the swimming, opened up an\nhour and a half before the official start\nat 8.30pm. Within 10 minutes, we had\npassed the check-in, security and found\nour seats. With our what-do-we-do-now\nlook, we knew we wanted to eat dinner,\nand find some merchandise. We exited\nthe building to head towards the long, yet\nquickly moving line around the little hut\nstaffed with a dozen of cashiers spread\nout over 20 meters. As we stood in line,\ngrateful for the time to check out all\nthe merchandise, I asked myself: what\nwill last long? Which merchandise will\nbreak easily and which will not loose its\nstyle? Over the years, I noticed that with\nmerchandise,suchasPEZdispeners,large\nkeychains, pens or t-shirts with massive\nlabels, that they will soon either degrade\ndue to quality or become my pajamas or\nrags. A 500% markup pays for the name,\nnot the quality. So I set my eyes on a very\nexpensive \u20ac50 t-shirt in dark blue with a\nwhite and simple \u201c2024 Paris\u201d text on the\nfront. Something, I felt confident I would\nwant to wear for many years. At the\ncashier, the women behind the counter\nwas relaxed enough to allow us to open\nup the t-shirts for size inspection, but\nquick and efficient enough to not waste\nany-time. As we aimed to pay, we were\nsurprised to learn that only one card was\naccepted, Visa. \u2018Visa dominates France\u2019,\nmy friend proceeds to explain. \u2018It is la\ncarte bleue (the blue card)\u2019. Fascinating,\nI thought. Luckily, we had one Visa card\nbetween us four. Cash was not accepted.\nWarm-up and the races\nWhile we waiting, I headed to the\nedge of our section to watch the athletes\nwarm-up. Watching some athletes swim\nlap after lap made my friend say \u2018their\nwarm-up is my workout\u2019. A sudden\ndarkness signalled the start of the event\nand everyone scrambled towards their\nseat. A well-curated video promoting\nthe grandness of athletisism, mixed\nwith images of French culture, such as\nMonet\u00b4s waterlillies, played on the large\nscreens \u2013 something clearly designed for\nthe fans watching online! A light show\naccompanied the loud music. As the\nshow ended, a few muffled sentences\nwere announced in French and English\nbeforethefirstmaleatheletesenteredthe\narena to begin the Men\u2019s 50m Freestyle.\nFor all five events, the athletes, most\nof them American, British, Australian,\nCanadian or French, were deeply focused\n\u2013 to the point that the crowd were\nbackground noise to them. A moment of\nsilence was asked, the gun shot and the\nswimmers dove. The audience cheered\nloudly, mostly for the French swimmers.\nOnce the first swimmer reached the final\nedge, a loud array of clapping filled the\nscene and would already die by the time\nthe last swimmer would arrive.\nThe athletes exited the pool and\nheaded towards the journalists. Behind\nthe camera, we could see athletes\ncongratulating each other, hugging and\nshaking hands. Very efficiently, the next\nevent would be announced, introducing\neach athlete. As everything was going\non, I took notice of the staff collecting the\nathletes warm-up clothes, some staff in\nsuits monitoring the edges of the pools\nto ensure proper conduct, scuba-divers\nscowering the floor before and after the\nevent, the masses of security all around\nand an army of reporters seated along\none length of the stadium.\nMarchand,McIntosh,McEvoy,\nMcKeown\nThis event introduced some\ninteresting athletes. Australian\u00b4s\nCameron McEvoy and Kaylee McKeown\ntook home two thirds of the gold\nmedals. It was unsurprising to learn that\nthe Australians are good swimmers.\nMcKeown swam two events, winning\ngold in 200m Backstroke and returning\nfor the 200m Medley Semi-finals. No\nother athletes competed twice that night.\nFrench swimmer Leon Marchand won\nthe 200m Individual Medley beautifully,\nwhen you could seem him leading in\nthe middle lane, the other swimmers\nflanking him like birds flying south for\nthe winter. 17-year old Canadian Summer\nMcIntosh dominated the 200m and\n400m Medley, setting an Olympic record\nfor the former.\nWith three finals came three\nceremonies. As the two Australian gold\nmedalists stood proudly, we listened to\nthe Australian national anthem twice,\nin guiltless silence. Compare this to\nMarchand\u00b4s ceremony, the French crowd\nsang in grandious pride the national\nanthem. Listening to a few thousand\npeople sing together was an experience\nlost to those watching online.

From large-scale protests\nacross the UK to our own university en-campment, there has been an increase\nin global conversation about the realities\nPalestinians face.\nHowever, the story of Palestine did not\nbegin recently, nor is it confined to moments of publicised crisis. It stretches\nback thousands of years. One of the most\nenduring ways this history has been persevered and shared is through literature,\na powerful medium for the narration of\ndisplacement, exile, and resilience.\nOver the past year, three works by\nPalestinian authors have particularly\nresonated with me, offering historical,\npersonal, and fictional perspectives on\nPalestine. These books not only offer\nintimate insights into the Palestinian\nexperience but also invite readers from\nall backgrounds to engage with the rich\nculture and humanity of a group of people whose voices are often marginalised.\nWhat makes these works so compelling\nis their stylistic diversity \u2013 one is a scholarly exploration, another a deeply personal memoir, and the third a piece of\nfiction \u2013 demonstrating the versatility\nof Palestinian literature in addressing its\ncomplex issues.\nPalestine: A Four Thousand\nYear History by Professor Nur\nMasalha\nNur Masalha\u2019s novel is a scholarly yet\naccessible work that dismantles myths\nabout Palestine being a land without a\npeople. Masalha traces the history of Palestine from antiquity to modern times,\nillustrating its deep roots in the region\u2019s\nhistory and geography. I found this book\nparticularly powerful because it educates\nreaders on how Palestine\u2019s existence predates colonial narratives, emphasizing\nthat the land and its people have a long\nand complex history. It\u2019s an eye-opening\nread for anyone seeking to understand\nthe historical context of the Palestinian\nstruggle beyond modern politics.\nI Saw Ramallah by Mourid\nBarghouti\nWritten after his return to Palestine following 30 years of exile, I Saw\nRamallah is a deeply personal and poignant memoir by poet Mourid Barghouti.\nThebookbeautifullycapturesthefeelings\nof displacement and longing for home\nthat so many Palestinians experience.\nBarghouti\u2019s reflections on the fragmented landscape, both physical and emotion-al, resonate profoundly with anyone who\nhas experienced exile. His prose, poetic\nand sharp, offers an intimate portrayal of\na homeland he knows through memory\nand distance. This memoir serves as a\nreminder of the personal costs of displacement and the enduring hope of re-turn.\nMen in the Sun by Ghassan\nKanafani\nMen in the Sun is a powerful novella\nthat uses fiction to highlight the harsh realities faced by Palestinian refugees. The\nstory follows three Palestinian men who\nattempt to escape the dire conditions of\nrefugee camps by smuggling themselves\ntoKuwait.Kanafani\u2019snarrativeweavestogether themes of exile, desperation, and\nbetrayal, illustrating the consequences\nof statelessness and loss. In its brevity,\nthis book delivers an enduring message\nabout the human cost of displacement.\nWritten in the 1960s, it reminds readers\nthat the plight of Palestinian refugees is\nnot just a historical issue, but an ongoing\nstruggle that echoes in the present day.\nInk and Identity:\nNarratives of Palestine\nBOOKS\nBooksWriter\nNADEEN DAKA\nNadeen gives a personal reflection\non key Palestinian literature that\ndeeply resonated with her.\nFront cover of I Saw Ramallah by Mourid Barghouti Amazon\n\n"

It wasn\u2019t long\nbefore I picked up how the fair worked\nwith scanning QR codes to get the details\nof each of the societies present.\nAfter getting details for three societies\nI planned on joining, a sticker, a couple\nof sweets, and successfully evading a\nfinancial society by convincing them\nthat I don\u2019t want a job, I had to cower\nfrom the storm while my more prepared\nfriend kept exploring. By the time I was\nonce again able to brave the rain, the\nsecurity had decided to implement the\nmost ridiculously congested one-way\nsystem they could think of, so we had to\ngo down the ramp to the hobbies, where I\nwould find some of the quirkier societies\nin addition to failing to resist the urge to\ninvestigate the sea shanty society\u2019s stall\n(they had a blahaj and chocolate, truly a\nmost despicable marketing technique).\nAfter avoiding the storm\u2019s worst by\nretreating to the library cafe for lunch, I\nunfortunately had to go through the rest\nof the one-way system the correct way\ndue to the greater security around. After\nseeing a person dressed in racing gear\nbeing pushed around on a luggage trolly\nand wondering why on earth the medics\nhad their own dedicated section, I would\nmake my way back up to the now much\nemptier Dalby Court, taking one last look\nbefore heading back to my halls to escape\nthe now returning rainstorm.\nOverall, I found it quite nice visiting\nall the different stalls despite all the rain\npresent.

Students were welcomed and\nasked to split into three groups, the 5K,\n8K or 12K running group, each group\nsmaller than the previous. After a quick\npicture was taken, groups sped off into\ndifferent directions. The group running\nthe 12K headed towards the northwestern curve of the Thames River,\npassing Hammersmith Bridge, only to\ncross into the southside at Barnes Bridge\nand returning to Fulham.\nWithin the three groups, smaller subgroups quickly formed as a result of\nstudents running at their comfortable\npace. Some students socialised while\nrunning, others spared their breath on\ntheir run, while solo-runners enjoyed the\ncold, yet semi-polluted air of London\u2019s\ntraffic in their own company. Despite the\nriverside path, some stretches of the path\nwere besides busy roads.\nAt the end of the run, some members\nclaimedtheygotlostonthepath,running\nin zig-zags through neighbourhoods.\nOther students announced themselves\nlost in the groupchats. In response,\ncommittee members shared their live\nlocations.\nFinally, a breakfast of buttered toast,\nbeans, fried eggs, baked sausages,\nmandarins and bananas was served to\neveryone. Vegetarian and vegan options\nwere also available. Students socialised\nin every corner of the house, some\nfinding space on the street outside.\nLocations will change weekly,\nwith different members hosting.

Although\nthe case occurred in 2018 and continues\nto work itself through various legal systems due allegations of collusion on the\npart of its investors, its lessons for founders and those interested in start-ups remain relevant, especially for the Imperial\ngrad.\nFanDuel was founded in 2009 in Edinburgh as a daily fantasy sports (DFS)\ncompany and quickly rose to promi-nence. Between 2009 and 2014, it raised\n$88 million and by 2015, it had achieved\na valuation of $1.2 billion after securing\na $275 million Series E round from major investors like KKR, Shamrock Ventures (Disney\u2019s family investment firm),\nGoogle, and NBC. Yet beneath the surface\nthe company was in trouble. While FanDuel made $124 million in annual rev-enue, it was spending multiples of that\non marketing in an effort to dominate\nthe DFS industry. This led to a significant\ncash burn, and by 2017, management was\nrunning out of options. A failed merger attempt with DraftKings\u2013blocked by\ngovernment regulators over antitrust\nconcerns\u2013only worsened the situation.\nWith nowhere to turn, Paddy Power\nBetfair, now rebranded as Flutter Entertainment, made an offer to acquire the\ncompany for $465 million in stock, not\ncash (the actual sale, however, was $558\nmillion). The value was significantly lower than FanDuel\u2019s internal valuation and\nwould leave the founders and employees\nwith nothing. However, the company\naccepted the terms, and the group went\non to become FanDuel. To understand\nhow the deal came to be and why it was\npushed through knowledge of three key\nterms are required: valuation, liquida-tion, and drag along rights.\nValuation refers to the estimated\nworth of a company and was the beginning of FanDuel\u2019s problems. While FanDuel\u2019s valuation increased through multiple rounds of funding and appeared to\nindicate the company\u2019s growing success,\nit was simultaneously raising the price\nthe company would need to secure to\nreturn money back to its investors. This\ncould only be achieved in two ways. Either the company would need to sell for a\nprice higher than what it had been valued\nat, or it would have to go public through\nan IPO at a valuation that justified the\nreturns expected by investors. As investor money poured in the achievability of\neither became more and more difficult.\nThe next key term to understand is\nliquidation preference. In a liquidation\npreference, certain investors are given\npriority in the event of a sale or liquidation of a company. For example, if an\ninvestor has twice the liquidation pref-erence, they are entitled to receive twice\ntheir original investment before any other participants. When FanDuel sold for\n$558 million dollars, later stage investors\ntook the first cut of the money before\nother shareholders like the founders and\nthe employees could. Once the terms of\nthe investments had been satisfied there\nwas no money left over for shareholders\nwho did not have priority to claim it.\nGiven the offer and liquidation preferences which would leave the majority of\nthe stakeholders with nothing \u2013 why did\nthe deal go through? The answer lies in\ndrag-along rights and the distinction between preferred and common sharehold-ers. Drag-along rights allow the majority\nof preferred shareholders to force the\ncommon (or \u201cordinary\u201d) shareholders to\nfollow the preferences of the preferred\nshareholders. In this case, the preferred\nmajority, represented by KKR and Shamrock who held 21% and 15% respectively\nof the total preferred shares were collectively designated \u201cdragging shareholders\u201d and could force the common\nshareholders to accept the deal even if it\ndisadvantaged them.\nThough readers and certain FanDuel\nemployees may rightfully feel the deal\nwas unfair, focusing solely on the questionable actions of some of the investors\noverlooks the more significant errors\nmade by FanDuel\u2019s leadership in managing the company\u2019s growth. They over-raised and took on too much debt. This\nforced them into unfavorable venture financing deals. Another unusual decision\nwas to turn to private equity (PE) rather\nthan traditional venture capital (VC). The\ntwo differ in philosophy and incentives.\nPE tends to focus on gaining control of\nthe companies accepting investment and\nthen seeking return on their investment,\nwhile VC is less focused on control and\ninvests in many companies.

The\nChagos Archipelago was acquired by\nthe British government from the thencolonyofMauritiusin1965for\u00a33million,\nand declared the British Indian Ocean\nTerritory (BIOT); but on 3rd October \u2013\nalmost 60 years later \u2013 the UK declared\nthat it would transfer sovereignty back\nto the Mauritian government. While the\ndistant memory of the Iraq War might\nlead one to believe that the UK has never\nlost the imperialist zeal that made and\nsustained the Empire in centuries past,\nby the 1980s nearly every colony had\nbroken free. That the Chagos Islands\nhas not followed suit in the four decades\nsince, at first face seems strange. On\nthe other hand, considering the dearth,\nabsence even, of education in schools\nabout the nation\u2019s role in colonial-era\natrocities, \u201csurprise\u201d is perhaps too\nstrong a description.\nWhat is certainly far more shocking is\nthe thoughtless attitude that the country\ndisplayed to Chagossians; moreso\nthe fact that successive governments\nhave all shown an unchanging level of\ncontempt to the native islanders as the\nlatter protest this injustice. In an effort\nto depopulate the region to build a joint\nmilitary base on the largest island Diego\nGarcia, for American and its own use, the\nBritish government forcibly displaced\n1,500 to 1,750 inhabitants \u2013 referred to\nas \u201cTarzans or Men Fridays\u201d in a 1966\ndiplomatic cable by D. A. Greenhill \u2013\nbetween 1967 and 1973. Officials went\nas far as to intimidate \u201cthe remaining\npopulation to leave, including by killing\ntheir dogs,\u201d according to a report by\nHuman Rights Watch in 2023.\nThe UK has since barred anyone,\nincluding ex-residents, from entry\n\u2013 even going as far as to declare the\nregion a Marine Protected Area (MPA)\nin 2010. During an arbitral tribunal held\nin 2015 to discuss MPA establishment,\nthe British side reasoned that \u201cthe\nregion is still pristine as a result of non-settlement, and should remain one of the\nvery few such rare areas in the world\u201d; yet\nthis makes the staggering assumption\nthat the Ilois way of life would pose a\nmajor danger to marine life. On the\ncontrary, conservationists argue that\nthe presence of \u2013 and active dialogue\nwith \u2013 indigenous people is absolutely\nnecessary for projects like this to be\neffective: in an interview with The Times,\nmarine ecologist Dr Mark Spalding\nnoted that \u201cthe world of conservation is\nlittered with failures where the people\ninvolved were not consulted\u201d and that\nif Chagossians are later allowed to\nresettle, \u201cWhy should they want to cooperate with the conservation groups\nrunning roughshod over them?\u201d All this\nindicates that the unspoken intent of\nthese proceedings is to further quash any\nchances of resettlement.\nThe International Court of Justice\n(ICJ), the highest court in the UN,\nadvised in February 2019 that the \u201cthe\nUnited Kingdom is under an obligation\nto bring to an end its administration\nof the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly\nas possible,\u201d describing its current\nsovereignty as \u201ca wrongful act entailing\nthe international responsibility of that\nState\u201d. A UN General Assembly vote in\nMay on the back of these conclusions\nended 116 to 6, overwhelmingly in favour\nof demanding withdrawal from the\narchipelago within six months. These\nwentignoreduntilNovember2022,when\nthen-Foreign Secretary James Cleverly\nmade a statement announcing that the\n\u201cUK and Mauritius have decided to begin\nnegotiations\u201d on Chagos\u2019s sovereignty\n\u2013 then last week lambasted the Prime\nMinister over the result of what he had\nstarted.\nIndeed, from both within and without\nthe Conservative party, the 3rd October\nstatement has met some opprobrium,\nwith some fearing that Chagos could set\na precedent that could see the Falkland\nIslands and Gibraltar, both disputed\nterritories, fall out of British control as\nwell. Others argue that the arrangement\ncould give China intelligence on the\nclandestine activity of the Diego Garcia\nbase, pointing to the high volume of\nMauritian imports coming from the\nsuperpower.\nBut the biggest problem with this,\nhighlighted by Chagossians themselves,\nis that two years of negotiations have in\neffectchangednothing.Theshiftinpower\ndoesn\u2019t change the fact that their land is\nstill under the authority of another state.\nThe1,000orsoinhabitantsexpelledfrom\nDiego Garcia, their children, and their\ngrandchildren will never see home again\nin their lifetimes \u2013 the UK said in the joint\nstatement that it would retain the base\nfor a minimum of 99 years. One could\neven doubt that Mauritius will be willing\nto put the money where their mouth is\nand commit to resettlement, given that\nin the two years of talks the Ilois were not\nconsulted even once. A sad conclusion,\nperhaps, but in a tale of colonial brutality\nand continued disregard, one can\u2019t really\nbe too surprised.\nThe announcement of the Chagos Islands hand-over to Mauritius couldn\u2019t\ncome soon enough.\nCOMMENTS\nThe ugly truth about\nBritish colonialism lies\nin the Indian Ocean\nCommentsWriter\nTARUN NAIR\nAerial view of Diego Garcia island in the Chagos archipelago\nLBJ Space Center - Wikimedia Commons\nThe unspoken intent is\nto quash any chances\nof resettlement\n\u201c\n\n"
