The undergrads are away; the PGTs are\ngrinding on with their work as usual; the College is barely\nticking over. So why produce a vacation FELIX? You may\nwell ask. In its twenty-five year history, FELIX has never been\nproduced in the Easter vac until now. So in many respects,\nthis issue can be thought of an experimental pilot scheme.\nIts success or failure has depended on the response for\ncopy from P G's.I have to thank Tom Abraham, the Chairman of the ICPGG, and all the other contributors for\nextracting their m attire digits and displaying the immense\ncreative writing potential that exists amongst PG' s.. Where have you all been hiding?\nI hope that the concept of FELIX vacation issues will\ncreate some interest in PG circles and then possibly\ndevelop into the issues of the year where PG' s can freely\nexpress themselves knowing that what they write will, on\nthe whole be read by just other PG' s. Here, then, is one opportunity whereby PG' s can attempt\nto throw off their 'hyper-apathetic' image .\n*\nNationally, the referendum debate looks as though it is going to get tough and possibly more dirty. As one national\nnewspaper put it recently: what with the anti-market lobby\nbeing supported by the Communists, the National Front,\nEnoch Powell, the IRA, the left wing of the Labour Party\nand the Trade Unions, the country will undoubtedly vote\noverwhelmingly 'yes' to the Common Market.\nAnxious to contribute to the discussion on this subject,\nFELIX has joined forces with ICWA's new President,\nStella Godfrey, in an effort to present a formal debate\nwithin the College. A provisional date has been set for\nthis event and we hope to be able to attract some prominent\npoliticians to speak. It is also hoped to get some students\nto speak on the debate as well: if there are any PG' s interested, ring the FELIX office sometime next week.\nT HI Eij CP^^^J?C PF JOB HUNTERS?\nAnon\nYou must be kidding! Seeking employment is not so much a joy, but much more a way of strife .\nWhat prospects have we, with a degree from IC? Better than\naverage, maybe? We, the job seekers, are desperately trying to\nsell a commodity in an open-market where prices (salaries) are\nrelated to demand. And for\nmost of us, there is a glut in\nthe market .With a first degree,\none can sell one's soul to a prospective employer for a below average standard of living. The employer finds such a buy\na real bargain, works for pea-nuts, partly trained and can fit\ninto many spheres. But what\nabout a higher degree? Those\nthree years as aPG are considered irrelevant to most prospective employers, as work\non some 'white elephant' pro-j ect, though to the college\nauthorities, it is \"academic\ntraining'. Not wanting to em ploy such a person, as they\nhave to pay a higher salary\nfor a PhD degree to someone\nthree years older than a new\ngraduate, they say 'You are\ntoo specialized for us'.\nNot many PhD's continue to\nwork in the same field but\nthere are those who, removed\nfrom reality, wish to continue\nworking In such fields as electrical conduction in gorgonzola\nor pig-farming in Israel.\nWhy are we in our present\nfield of work? Perhaps, like\nme, you were told, \"this is\nthe in-field in which to be for\na secure job and a bright fu t ure\". I won't be surprised if\nthe Careers' Advisor is sing ing the same tune.\nThe irony of the problem is that some who could not keep\nup in this field have dropped\nout to far better things - good\nstandard of living, secure and\ninteresting jobs, bright future,\nis, then, this sac if ice worth\nthe agony of facing a tightfisted employer asking silly questions like, \"why do you\nwant to work for us?\" or\n\"where do you see yourself in\nfive years from now?\" \"We'll\nlet you know if we want you!\"\nTea-boys and secretaries\nare paid ex h orbit ant rates and\nstill demand more, while professionals are content to say that they are only working for\nthe enjoyment and not the sal ary. This attitude only portrays professionals as being\neccentrics contemplating their\nown importance and deprives\nthe recent graduates of getting\nbetter deals for themselves.\nTo add insult to in ju iry, we are even deprived of Unemployment Benefits. To shrug\noff social responsibility the\ngovernment has set up the\nPER, known by the starving\nunemployed to be a waste of\ntime. Are these the joys to\nwhich we once looked forward?\n1\nrr j j(o Li\nK.M. Ib riki an At the moment most P.G. s are faced with poor job prospects.\nMost parameters influencing this state of affairs are beyond the\nP.G. s' power to control .However, the P.G. group is not completely without some means of improving matters. Two things\ncan be done.\nFirst, it may be helpful to\ntry to achieve a higher degree\nof co-ordination between research activities at College\nwith those of institutions\nP.G' s are likely to seek employment at, when they finish\ntheir College training. The lack of new posts for University lecturers will mean more\nscience and engineering PCs going for jobs in industry or\ngovernment run establishments.\nThe nature of employment will vary depending on whether the\nP.G. is an M. Sc. or a PhD, in general the former tending\nto go for dev elopement, production or management and\nthe latter for pure or applied\nresearch. Future efforts by\nthe P.G. group directed to wards this coordination of research activities may help\nthe P.G. find a job by making\nhis college training more\nreadily acceptable to his future employer.\nSecondly, support by the\nP.G. group for more interdepartmental courses can help\nthe situation further. The reason for this is two fold. First ly, P.G. s often find that by\nthe time they have finished\ntheir college training their\nfield of special is ation is no\nlonger important enough for\nthem to continue it somewhere\nelse-hence they have to move\nto another field .Secondly,\nq yer jap between engineering\nand applied science fields\nmeans the P.G. must ha vs a good general knowledge in\nthese various fields even,\nthough some of this knowledge\nmay not bear directly on his PhD. project. The answer\nlies in organising a series of\nlectures up to M.Sc. level that\ncan be attended by both M.Sc. and PhD. students. An excel lent example of this is the\ninterdepartmental M.Sc. course\non Science of Materials. The course draws its lecturers\nfrom a number of departments\nand provides a good understanding of the physics, chemistry and metallurgy of materials and their uses in the various engineering fields. P.G. s following the course find they \u2022\ncan be flexible enough to move\nbetween disciplines. Hence\nfurther cooperation between\ndepartments in other advanced\nfields is\"ip the inter es te of\nthe P.G. FELIX,\nNewspaper of Imperial\nCollege Union\nMichael 3.L.

    "content": "FELIX PG's: A VIEW FROM ABOVE R.T.S MYTH gives a pragmatic view of postgraduates\nBEFORE COMING to Imperial College I spent several years in industry and during that time I came into contact with\nvery few people who possessed postgraduate qualifications . Those I did meet\nalways impressed me with their ability\nto completely lose me in a technical discussion. This resulted in me believing,\nas do the vast majority of common folk,\nthat the select few who em bel ish their\nname with selections from the alphabet\nmust possess infinite wisdom and\nability .\n\"(Postgraduates')... extra three\nyears at University ... are aimed at\nperfecting their ability to ask unanswerable questions?' ' *\nI now know that this is not true for\nafter careful study of P G'sI am to rev e al' the secret play by which all postgraduates are trained to gain immediate\nadvantage over all human beings. Their\nthree extra years at University are not\nintended as an opportunity for the development of deductive and managerial\nskills but are aimed at perfecting their\nability to ask unanswerable questions. The questions must however relate the\none topic with which PG' s have ex-clu sive knowledge, ie their thesis .\nUnfortunately on completion of his\ncourse the PG has only one advantage\nover the average graduate. This is a profound knowledge of an exclusive and\ninvariably useless area of science, literature history or whatever. The exclusiveness of this knowledge is his only\nprotection against attack by those who\nmay wish to probe his ability. At the\nsame time it remains a powerful weapon\nfor intimidating fellow contestants in the\nrate race of life. It is not s uprising that when aPG seeks employment he faces the bitter\nrealisation that his extra years at university mean little or nothing to prospective\nindustrial employers. The result is that\nall to often he seeks further refuge with in the University inventing new areas of\nresearch that will enable new generations\nof graduates to achieve a useless degree\nof exclusiveness.\nExamination of the process that changes a bright, keen and potentially useful graduate into a disillusioned postgraduate is very revealing.\n\"Here, the supervisor establishes\nhis superiority be being able to \"suggest\" the most impractical subjects\nfor research.\"\n\u2022Within the first few days of becoming\na top 2% man, the softening-up process\nbegins. A secret session takes place between student and supervisor. Here the\nsupervisor establishes his superiority by\nbeing able to \" suggest\" the most impractical subjects for research. Any ideas\nthe student may have for doing worthwhile work are ruthlessly dismissed by a torrent of unanswerable questions. When indoctrination of the student is\ncomplete, he is allowed to escape to the\nlibrary where the next act of the farce\ntakes place. Here the student faces his\nfirst and only real test. He must esta blis h beyond any doubt that nobody has\never attempted to investigate his proposed area of work, or if this has been\ndone then it must be established that the\nmethod of investigation was so different\nthat a meaningful comparison of results\nwill never be possible. Failure to carry\nout this part of the project thoroughly\ncan cause acute em baras s ment in the\nfuture if someone is able to answer the\nunanswerable question.\nSecure in the knowledge that nobody\nhas ever shown an interest in the pro-posed' area of study, the student then\nwastes at least one year building his\nexperimental apparatus, or a least rearranging equipment left by his predecessors. The uniqueness of the experimental equipment is the student's insurance\npolicy against possible failure to produce positive results. All measurements\nare made by indirect methods so that\nspecial conversion factors have to be\napplied before any data becomes comprehensible. Besides maintaining the essential exclusiveness of the work, this has\ntwo other advantages. The calibration\ncurves serve as useful padding for the\nthesis and it becomes almost impossible\nfor the supervisor to check on one's progress .\n\"The uniqueness of. the experimental equipment is the student's in*\nsur ance policy against possible failure to produce positive results,\"\nDuring the first two years of his pro-j ect, the student has time to indulge in\na few diversionary pastimes like croquet,\nsquash or chasing the blues on the river.\nEvenings may be spent in idle gossip\nabout how fast we should dip our paddles\nin and out for maximum effect. Very\nFreudian,\nThis idyllic time is however interrupted by the com pulsar y colloquia. The\nsecret here is to speak in a loud but in distinct voice for fifty minutes, the audience having been totally lost after five\nminutes otherwise question time can be\nnasty as rival students and their supervisors try to impress each other by making the speaker appear stupid. Unfortunately this happens all too often and\nthe student who recognises beforehand\nthat he is stupid will lace his talk with\nred herrings to cause infighting amongst\nthe supervisors. Never a pretty sight.\nAbsolute silence or total chao es are the\nsurefire signs that the student has succeeded In being transferred from M Phil to Ph D.A frantic collecting of experimental\ndata marks the next stage of the training\nprogramme for make-your-mind-up-time is\ncoming. Do you write your thesis now or\nproduce a few extra graphs? A second\nvisit is made to the library to check that\nnobody else has been stupid enough to of\nrecently published anything related to\nones own work.\nThe time that should be spent writing-up is dissipated by per suing games of\nchance such as bridge, horse racing, war\ngames, and running a book on one's chan ces of surviving the approaching viva is\noften profitable .\nViva Day is the day of judgement\nwhen one<\"is assessed for ability to deflect answerable questions and to aska gentleman so that the examiner need not\nfear that you will threaten his position\nsome time in the future.\n\"What company shall I bless with my\nunlimited talents?\" soon becomes a plea\nfor now the student is dealing with professional ego-def later s who delight in\nremarks like \"Research? Ah, yes, that's the thing we can't afford to do when\nthings are bad, and what we haven't got\ntime for when things are good\".\n\"Absolute silence or total chaos\n(at colloquia) are the surefire signs\nthat the student has succeeded in being transferred from M Phil to Ph D.\" In the unlikely event that an offer of\nemployment is made, the salary will be\nno better than it would be for a graduate\nand considerably less than a British Rail\nporter would accept. The reason for this\nis simple .The employer knowns that the\nstudent has always existed on a pittance,\nwhilst the porter has not had the benefit\nof exclusive education to enable him to\nsurvive or such a small amount, he obviously requires more.\nThis is the price paid for becoming\nan exclusive member of society. If nobody understands what the PG knows,\nhow can his value be assessed? Whats\nmore, the postgraduate's obvious ability to lose people in technical discussion will win few friends and supporters in\nthe outside world.\nSTUDENT HOUSES\nSUMMER LETTING SCHEME\nA MANAGER AND ASSISTANT MANAGERS are required for the Summer Let ting Scheme in Evelyn Gardens\nand Ravenscourt Park. The Manager will be paid \u00a328.00 per\nweek and Assistant Manager \u00a325.00\nper week, all with free accommodation\nand National Insurance Stamp paid by\nthe Scheme .

    "content": "Founded in 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION FREI! No.384. FRIDAY,18 TH APRIL,1975. ICPGG COMMENTS ON ITS . . .\nCYCP SUBMISSION\nTHE COMMITTEE of Vice-Chancellors and College Principals in response to criticism expressed in certain quarters about\npostgraduate education decided to set up a study group to look\ninto all aspects of this subject. Although the IC postgraduate\ngroup was not asked for a submission, it has been decided to present one anyway, in order to ensure that student opinion was not\noverlooked.\nProposals were submitted\nin each of the following areas.1. The 'support' grant system\n2 . Supervision and Training3. Period of study\n4. The status of postgraduates\n5. Un ionisation and Representorder to rectify this, we proposed that all projects should\nbe fully discussed at section-3. Period of Study .\nThe increasing complexity\nof research work demands more\nSPECIAL\nPG ISSUE\nation\n6. Part-time teaching\n7 . Overseas students\nA brief summary of the various sections is presented be-low:\n1 . The 'support' grant system.\nAt present research councils award 'support' grants directly\nto various departments .We felt\nthat a change in the system\nwhereby the research support\ngrant is awarded to the student\nwould improve the status of\nthe PG and encourage supervisors to offer more interesting and viable research pro-j ect s. The departments would\nthen also find it imperative to\nprovide adequate research fac-ili ties.2. Supervision and Training.\nTying a student to one supervisor is not entirely satis factory especially in the case\nof academic staff who have too\nhigh an administrative workload and other outside commitments . Joint supervision is a possible solution to this problem .\nAn unnecessarily large\nnumber of projects end up being non-viable, due to inadequate prior preparation. In\nsophisticated design, implementation and analysis. In consequence the time required for\nresearch work and its writing\nup has increased considerably\nover the past few years.\nThe ICP GG therefore proposes that where an extension\nis unavoidable, students\nal meetings before they are\npresented to the student.\nFinally, intensive super-vision coupled with more formal training during the initial period of research work would\nenable the students to utilize their time and ability, more\neffectively than is the case at\npresent.\nshould continue to get the necessary financial support.\n4. The status of postgraduates\nResearch work can in general be classified as lying somewhere in a continuum between the very personal project of one research student,\nand the qu ari research assistant ship type of work where the\nproblem and the strategy for\nits solution have been externally defined by a supervisor.\nMost of the work carried out at\nIC tends to be of the latter\ntype.\nIn the short term we propose\nincreasing the proportion of\nPhD research students who are\nfinanced as research assistants on realistic salaries, while in the long term a salary\nstructure should be introduced\nfor all research workers taking\naccount of the notion of compensation for limited autonomy.\n5. Unionisation and Representation.\nThe Student union should\nserve this purpose but it demonstrably fails . A separate\npostgraduate union would probably be counter productive.\nEstablished trade unions can never really represent all the\nrequirements of postgraduate\nstudents. The ICP GG should\nfulfil this role but in order to\nincrease its effectiveness a sabbatical year should be provided for the Chairman.\nIn view of the large number\nof postgraduate students at\nIC we would like to see separate PG representation on the\nmajor College committees.\n6. Part-time teaching.\nThere has been a lot of\ndiscussion on this topic. It\nremains the firm policy of ICP GG that PG' s engaged in part-time teaching activities should be paid at the economic\nrate and not considered as\ncheap labour.\n7. Overseas Students .\nThe high proportion of overseas students seems to be\ncausing concern in certain\nquarters. ICP GG maintains\nthat the benefits of having\noverseas students outweighs\nthe marginal financial saving\nthat might accrue by a drastic\nreduction of the number of\"\noverseas postgraduates.\n*\nIn conclusion, some of the\nearlier proposals might, to\nsome degree, compromise the\nautonomy of various sections\nand departments. The benefits\nwhich will result are of greater\nimportance than the slight reduction in'academic freedom'.\n\n"

However let us enjoy the peace and quiet\nwh i le it lasts.\nTwo important events are coming up next term. There is the\nPostgraduate Group Executive,\nnamely Chairman (who also acts as PGA O), Secretary and\nTreasurer, and the not quite\nso serious business of the\nAnnual Dinner.\nFirst about the elections. As you may have noticed we\ndo not hold these at the same\ntime as the general rabble.\nInstead, we hold them at the\nbeginning of the third term.\nThe nomination papers will be\nup the requisite number of\ndays before the Annual General Meeting, with the actual el rect ion taking place at this\nmeeting. The job of Chairman\ncan be both interesting and\nrewarding. It also helps In\ndeveloping any latent leadership qualities. Any postgraduate who wants to know more\nabout the post should get In\ntouch with me (Int. 3T03). For the first time ever we\nhope to have a postgraduate\nannual dinner. There seems to\nbe a great deal of interest in\nhaving such a dinner. We hope\nto organise it for sometime towards the end of the term. Tic ket will be available from the\ndepartmental postgraduate reps\nas soon as the details are\nfinalised.\nThe Postgraduate Group\nhas done fairly well as far as\nthe internal organisation is\nconcerned. We have some\nstrong groups and a few embryo groups in most of the de-partments. The two major departments when these has not\nbeen much activity have been\nPhysics and Mechanical Engineering. While there has been\nsome sort of interest In Phys ics, the Mechanical Engineers have been steadfast In\nsticking to their self-proclaim-ed policy of isolationism. The\nirony Is that on the whole they\ncan be a sociable lot. I am\nhopeful that something can be\ndone to purge them ob their\nisolationist tendencies.\nRelations with IC Union\nare at a low ebb at present.\nDuring my term of office I have\ntried to ll as e with the Union\nand by and large, we have been\nable to co-operate on most\nissues. One of the main reasons for this has been Trev\nPhillips' personal interest in\npostgraduates. The other union officers, although in some\ninstances sympathetic towards\nthe PG' s, seem unable to comprehend the many issues facing us. The road forward as\nfar as the Postgraduate Group\nis concerned would, I believe,\nlie In taking an independent\nline. We should be responsible\nfor the interest of the 1600\npostgraduates In this college\nbecause neither the CC U's nor ICU seem capable of fulfilling such a role. The almost\ntotal (except for a few immature PG' s) apathy of PG' s towards the CC U's cannot be\ndismissed in terms of the\nusual student apathy towards\nunions. Most postgraduates\nfeel that the CC U's are irrelevant as far as they are concerned. I must add that In my\npersonal opinion the CC U's do\nago ob job in involving the undergraduates in their various\nactivities, but they seem unable or in some cases uninterested in encouraging PG part-ici pati on. There also seems to\nbe some sort of socio-cultural\n'age' gap between PG' s and\nundergraduates which both\nsides tacitly accept, and\nwhich neither is interested in\nbridging. It Is therefore essential that the PG Group takes\non fully the job of looking\nafter the interests of postgraduates, and force IC Union and\nthe College to recognise and\naccept It in this role.\nFinally there are still many\nissues to be tackled. The\nchief among these is obtaining\nadequate safe qu ard s with regard both to the viability and\nfinancing of research work.\nThe fact that the existing situation is pretty grim has to be\nbrought to the notice of the\nCollege and academic staff.\nThe recognition of this problem is a necessary prerequisite to finding its solution. ANNUAL DINNER Friday 2nd May, 7 JOO for 7 JO, College Block. Principal\nGuest, Dr Germain Greer,\nAuthor of 'The Female Eunuch'\nTickets \u00a31.80, from Social Reps\nor R. C.S.U. Office.\n\n"
