And Dimmu\nBorgir, but you can\u2019t have everything.\nHaving missed the opening band of\nthe night, (the friendly-sounding Five\nFinger Death Punch), due to the vagaries of the London transport network \u2013\nthanks, Boris \u2013 by the time me and my\nfriend finally got into Brixton on Saturday we were both well in the mood for\na romantic Valentines night of sonic\nassault and battery. Which was lucky,\nconsidering the occasion.\nUnusually for a rock concert, the\nair-conditioning in the place had\nbeen turned up to 11 \u2013 in deference,\none assumes, to the fact that fully half\nthe crowd were wearing floor-length\nleather trench coats. Very rock. Still,\nit was bastard freezing outside, so the\nGoths got to feel smug for a change.\nUnearth were just hitting the stage as\nwe got the first beers in. The US five-piece aren\u2019t famous for their subtlety,\nbut if brutal, unrefined aggression is\nyour thing then you can definitely do\nBrixton yields to\ndeath metal crusade\nDuncan Casey\nFour monsters of scary goth-metal - Five Finger Death Punch,\nUnearth, Dimmu Borgir and Lamb of God - team up to unleash\nsatanic imagery on Brixton Acadamy. Duncan Casey reports\nworse. The larynx-shredding vocals of\nthe obligatory long-haired lead singer,\nalong with his uncanny ability to piss\noff the security men, meant that despite the early bill the band secured\na rapturous reception from the circle\npits which quickly formed at the front.\nNot that I was anywhere near them \u2013 I\nam definitely too old for that shit.\nThe atmosphere was ruined a bit,\nthough, by the appearance of Dimmu\nBorgir, with the kind of posturing self-indulgence that would make Axl Rose\nblush. The band are a bit like Lordi\n(of Eurovision fame), only without any\nnoticeable sense of irony, replete with\nmake-up, studded pauldrons and an\nutterly unnecessary preponderance\nof pentangles. However, what really\nkilled the mood was the noise they\nmade \u2013 a kind of gothic elevator music:\nthink Lord of the Rings: The Musical,\nonly shit. Et tu, Gimli?\nDespite the best efforts of the crazy\nNorwegians, Lamb of God\u2019s closing set\nwas a triumph of stripped-down, no-bullshit Southern US death metal. Boy,\nthese lads have some issues, although\nthe chances of you hearing much about\nthem over the relentless intensity of the\nbass pedals were fairly limited. Still, the\ncrowd knew the words off by heart and\nalthough the format of the show necessitated a pretty short set \u2013 an hour, at\nmost \u2013 the combination of the tempo,\nthe strobes, the sheer bloody volume\nand the mist of testosterone in the air\nmeant that everyone left stress-free\nand happy, having snarled away their\nweek\u2019s woes at the rafters. Now there\u2019s\na way to beat the credit crunch...\n\u201cIf brutal,\nunrefined\naggression\nis your thing\nthen you can\ndefinitely do\nworse.\u201d\nLamb of God guitarist Mark Morton gazes wistfully into the distance\nAfter the publicity wanes, these people will have to get day-jobs\nYou can\u2019t really get much grander\nthan the O2 arena, AKA the Millennium Dome. With a capacity of 20,000,\nwhen it\u2019s full to the brim on a sold-out\nevening, as it was when Keane hit the\nstage a couple of weeks ago, the atmosphere could is palpably energetic and\nemotionally charged.\n\u2018The Lovers are Losing\u2019 from their\n3rd album was the surprising opener,\nwhich did its job to rouse the hungry\nhoards. Tom Chaplin, the front man,\nonce a chubby face, now adorning a\nnew trim and more mature look, took\nour breath away with his electrifying\nstage presence and angelic voice. With\nhis flashy, rusty gold jacket and skinny\njeans, all eyes were drawn to Chaplin\nas he delivered with his bandmates a\ncombination of 22 songs from a repertoire derived from all past albums.\nHalfway through the night, the B\nstage paved way for a splendid acoustic set, allowing Keane to treat us with\nsome rarities like the melodic, quintessence of soothingness that was\n\u2018Sunshine\u2019, \u2018Snowed Under\u2019 from their\nextreme early days that pleased hardcore fans and last but not the least, the\namazing \u2018Try Again\u2019 that was simply\ndelicate and beautiful. By returning\nto their roots and going back to the\nbasics, Keane showed us exactly why\nthey are where they are now. Spotlights\nfrom the front and back of the arena lit\nup this second small stage, \u2018under the\niron sea\u2019 of darkness, Keane were the\nsource of energy and light, taking us\naway from \u2018the bad dream\u2019 \u2018again and\nagain.\u2019\nIn contrast to the soft melodic in-terlude, Keane followed up with their\nThe other kind of Keane.

The creation of the\narchive will come as a welcome relief to\na lot of people at Imperial College (IC),\nnone more so than the clubs and societies at Imperial College Union (ICU).\nAfter many months of extensive\nresearch and numerous meetings, a\ncompany has finally been found that\nwill digitise the past issues of felix and\nmake the files fully searchable. The decision was taken last August when it\nwas discovered that some of the bound\neditions were starting to deteriorate.\nThe obvious solution to preserve these\nvaluable archives was to digitise the\neditions in our possession and then\nhand over the bound editions to the\nImperial College Archive Department.\nThe project was discussed with several companies, before the University\nof London Computer Centre (ULCC)\nwas finally chosen to undertake the\nproject. It quickly became apparent\nthat if a high quality product was to be\nproduced, significant financial contributions would be required to fund this\nmammoth project.\nThe expected cost of the project\nwill be around \u00a355,000 which includes\n\u00a325,000 for the digitisation of the archives and \u00a330,000 for the final web\nsite. Several sources of funding have\nbeen sought, in particular the Imperial\nCollege Trust as well as the the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)\n(who are funded by the UK higher\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk News\nNominations are over,\nelections are go go go...\nIt\u2019s official, the Imperial College Union\nSabbatical elections are underway after\nthe candidates had their first meeting\non Monday. Deputy President (Finance\n& Services) and Returning Officer for\nthe elections, Christian Carter, met the\ncandidates to go over the election pro-cedure, as well as the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of\nelection campaigning. Nearly all of the\n15 Sabbatical candidates turned up to\nthe meeting, which the nine candidates\nfor Student Trustees also attended.\nThis year, due to a change in the Imperial College Union [ICU] Constitution, candidates are allowed to mention their opposition in the campaign\nmaterial. Candidates have, however,\nbeen warned that any statements made\nin their campaign material need to be\nbacked up with strong evidence otherwise they face being fined or even expelled from the elections race.\nEven though the Constitution was\nchanged to allow negative campaign-ing, the one thing that wasn\u2019t changed\nthat has raised concern, is the ability to\nremove seconders that the candidates\ndo not recognise. The reason for this\nis that the seconders are immediately\npart of the campaign team for that candidate and as such must abide by the\nsame rules; if they break the rules, the\ncandidates get fined. This was the concern of some of the candidates both this\nand last year, though one of the major\nproblems with removing seconders is\nthat the candidate might not have the\n20 required to stand for election.\nEarlier this week, Mr Carter announced to the candidates that due his\nworkload at this time of year, he has\nelected a Deputy Returning Officer,\nnaming past DPFS John Matthews for\nthe role. Some have found this move a\nbit strange as Mr Matthews is no longer a student at Imperial, however he is\na life member which makes the decision legitamate.\nManifestos of the candidates will be\nreleased on the ICU web site as well as\nLive! today, and will appear in felix next\nweek along with an interview with the\ntwo Presidential candidates.\nHustings will be held next week on\nTuesday 10th March in the Junior\nCommon Room and Thursday 12th\nMarch in da Vinci\u2019s.

The\nfinal product will be a PDF for each\nissue, with a web-based interface that\nwill allow users to search for individual\nwords, issues and dates.\nAfter speaking with representatives\nfrom ULCC and JISC, felix ascertained\nthat this project would be the first of\nits kind, as no other university student\nnewspaper in the UK has done this.\nThere are, however, a few in the US\nthat have undertaken similar projects\nand the feedback from them has been\na positive one, something that will undoubtedly please both ICU and IC.\nThe first batch of issues has already\nbeen sent to ULCC for digitising and\nthe project is expected to be finished\nby November 2009. Once finished, the\nnew web site will enable users to search\nfor anything they like, which could\nrange from looking up stories covering past Beit redevelopments to angry\nletters written by Rectors to editors of\nfelix. This will be very useful to clubs\nand societies who wish to discover\nmore about their history, as well as to\nalumni who will be able to relive their\ntime as students at the College.\nfelix had a quick look through the archive to try and find some gems from\nthe past, which can be found right.\nWith the creation of the archive, you\ntoo will be able to search for some of\nthe wacky news stories of yesteryear.\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nThe current felix archive in the back room of the office\nImperial makes\na difference with\nOne Water\nGolden Oldies\nGilead Amit goes through the\nearly copies of felix to find his\nfavourite stories\nBaby found in Beit\nQuadrangle\nUnfortunate episode mars freshers\u2019\nnight\nAt 11 o\u2019clock on the night of the first R.C.S. Freshers\u2019 dinner, a\nbaby was found in the middle of the Union quadrangle. The President of the Union and the Warden of the Hostel quickly arrived on\nthe scene and supervised the removal of the baby, whose name\nis believed to be Austin, to Prince Consort Road, where it was left\nfor the night. By the following morning it had disappeared. Several\nsuch episodes have occurred recently; it is reported that steps are\nbeing take to discourage the offenders.\nIssue 111, Friday 25 October 1957\nIssue 128, Friday 16 January 1959\nWomen Professor for Imperial\nCollege\nDr. Helen K. Porter, DSC FRS, whose appointment to the Chair of\nPlant Physiology at the Imperial College of Science and Technology is announced by the University of London, becomes the first\nwoman to hold a Chair at the College.\nDr. Porter\u2019s association with Imperial College dates from 1921\nwhen, after graduating from Bedford College, she spent a year\nin the Department of Organic Chemistry and was then appointed\nResearch Assistant in the department of Botany. Ten years later\nshe joined the staff of the Research Institute of Plant Physiology\nattached to the College and concentrated primarily on research in\nthe field of carbohydrate metabolism.\nShortly after the war she spent a year in Washington University,\nSt. Louis, studying enzymological methods. The subsequent development of her work, in collaboration with a group of colleagues\nand postgraduate research students, led, with the support of the\nNuffield Foundation, to the opening in 1953 of an enzymology laboratory in the Plant Physiology section of the College, to accommodate a research group under Dr. Porter\u2019s direction.\nIn 1956 she was elected to Fellowship if the Royal Society, the\ntwelfth woman to be so honoured. In 1957 Dr. Porter was appointed to a new Readership in Enzymology at the Imperial College.\nIssue 120, Friday 2 May 1958\nPyjama Party\nIn the evening a seventy-strong pyjama party, in luxuriant night\nattire, began their gay publicity stunt from S. Kensington; to the\naccompaniment of hot rhythm and hectic jiving (stationmasters\nand reporters getting hep) the party deviously reached Blackfriars,\nand then proceeded to Fleet Street.\nHere that law appeared gaily whistling, attracting passionate\nblown kisses from passing nightshirts. On Trafalgar Square, humming patriotic airs, and provoking considerable public interest,\nHere the skiffle group provided music for jiving in the wonderful\nsetting of floodlit fountains \u2013 onlookers joining in.\nBut the law at last politely but firmly intervened, informing the\nparty that they were contravening the \u201cSessional law\u201d, as Parliament was then sitting. The procession was forcibly dispersed by \u2018A\u2019\nDivision but had soon re-formed, and disappeared into the depths\nof Green Park Station. The revellers returned, as they went, to the\nsound of strumming guitars.\nThe sixty years that separate us from the yellowed typewritten\nsheets of the early felices have unsurprisingly seen tremendous\nchanges in the way students write and the subjects they are interested in. The passion for occasional risqu\u00e9 humour, however, has\nlasted. A flick through these past issues provides a very powerful\nimage of student life in the middle of last century, and makes for\nvery entertaining reading. Over the coming year, a fully-searcha-ble archive will hopefully be up and running and accessible to all.\nMANIFESTOS & VOTE: www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote MANIFESTOS: live.cgcu.net\nEx-IC \u2018rich kid\u2019 sues school\nfor \u00a31 million\nDina Ismail\nNews Correspondent\nAn ex-Imperial student is suing his\nformer public school for almost \u00a31million after he claims he was bullied by\npupils who \u2018made his life hell.\u2019\nThe former student has launched\na landmark High Court case against\nBerkhamsted Collegiate School, claiming that staff failed to protect him from\nfellow pupils who taunted him for\nyears.\nThe university graduate alleges\nthat the experience left him mentally\nscarred and overshadowed his career\nprospects causing him to graduate with\na second class degree when he had the\npotential to get a first.\nAmongst the grievances mentioned,\nthe student alleges he was taunted for\nbeing rich and living in a large house.\nDespite this he still managed to attain ten grade A* or A GCSEs and four\nA-grade A-levels. The school, which\ncharges fees of \u00a315,000 a year, has insisted that the incidents were too trivial to be considered bullying.\nThe 23 year old graduate\u2019s lawyer,\nhowever, alleges that by attending the\nschool his client has been left with\npoor self-esteem and suffers from a\ndepressive disorder. The school is accused of negligence and breach of duty\nof care towards its student who had\nunavailingly complained repeatedly to\nstaff and governors. The school, which\nis facing the possibility of a substantial\npayout, is denying any wrong doing.\nIf this landmark case wins, a new\nprecedent could be set for compensation claims made against schools which\nfail to protect bullying victims.\nBerkhamsted Collegiate School where the student claims his time\nthere \u201c made his life hell\u201d\nDid you know that 1 billion people in\nthe world don\u2019t have access to clean\nwater? Or that 2 million people die\neach year as a result of water related\ndiseases? When the people at ONE\nWater found this out, they wanted to\ndo something to change those figures.\nAll their profits from sales of ONE Water go to building unique PlayPump\u00ae\nwater systems in Africa which improve\npeople\u2019s lives by providing free, clean\nwater.\nThrough selling approximately\n150,000 bottles of ONE Water over the\nlast 18 months, Imperial has taken a\nsmall step in helping their cause - providing clean free, water to those who\nreally need it. Thanks to our students\nand staff who bought the water, we\nhave been able to donate a ONE WATER PlayPump\u00ae to Ngabeni Primary\nSchool in Maxesibeni, in the Eastern\nCape, South Africa.\nTo find out more about the ONE\nprojects see www.onedifference.\norg\nChildren playing on the PlayPump in South Africa\n\n"

Crumble\n\u00bd a pack of feta (or ewe) cheese into the\nmixture along with a handful of grated\ncheddar. Season with pepper.\nNow, line a heatproof dish with 3 sheets\nof filo pastry and brush with a little melted\nbutter. Tip in your leeky, cheesy mixture\nand fold the filo over the filling to make a\nparcel. Brush the pastry with melted butter to stop it burning, and then bake in the\noven for 30 minutes. The pastry should be\ngolden and crunchy. This is nice served\nwith salad and cold white wine.\n2. Simply Welsh lamb. Make sure\nit is Welsh, or I won\u2019t be happy. What\u2019s the\npoint in flying in lamb from 11,680 miles\naway in New Zealand when there are\nplenty of tasty sheep just 130 miles away\nin Wales!? Madness. Anyway, get some\nnice Welsh lamb chops and season them\nServes 2\n370g stewing beef (something with lots of fat running through it)\nHalf an onion, finely chopped\n1 carrot, finely chopped\n2-3 cloves of garlic, squashed and finely chopped\nHandful fresh sage or thyme leaves.\n4-5 rashers streaky bacon or pancetta (preferably smoked), cut into 1cm thick strips\nOlive oil\n300ml red wine\n400g tin of chopped tomatoes\n6 open-cap mushrooms, sliced\nTagliatelle\nParmesan cheese for serving\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\nDice the beef (1cm or 2cm chunks) and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nHeat a tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat and fry the meat until\nbrowned on all sides (if your frying pan is a bit on the small side, do this in batches). Remove the\nmeat from the pan and set aside.\nReturn the pan to the heat, adding a bit more oil if necessary, and fry the bacon until the fat turns\ngolden and starts to crisp. Turn the heat down a fraction and add the finely chopped vegetables,\ngarlic and 2 thirds of the herbs (not the mushrooms), frying until soft.\nReturn the beef to the pan and pour in the wine, turning up the heat and simmer vigorously for\na couple of minutes before adding the chopped tomatoes. Turn the heat down to low and allow\nto simmer gently for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally and adding a splash of water when\nneeded so as to keep the meat covered (you can actually get away with adding quite a lot of water\nwithout even remotely impairing the taste as all it does is cook off- helping keep your meat nice\nand tender and sauce nice and silky).\nHalf an hour before serving, add the sliced mushrooms and check the seasoning. Ten minutes\nbefore serving, cook the pasta in well-salted water until al-dente or according to the packet\u2019s\ninstructions.\nDrain the pasta and add to the pan with the beef, mix well and serve with plenty of Parmesan.\nEnjoy with some garlic bread and a glass of red wine.\nWritten and Created by David Wallis\nSlow-cooked Ragu\n\u201cHappy Saint David\u2019s Day\u201d, said one daffodil. \u201cShut it\u201d, said the other,\nand promptly put the nice daffodil in a headlock.

The team started off well with\nwomen\u2019s and men\u2019s freestyle teams\nfinishing 21st and 29th respectively,\ngiving the women\u2019s team a place in the\nB-final, finishing ahead of the much\nfancied Liverpool and Hertfordshire.\nThe good performances kept coming\nwith Andy Hagues finishing 16th and\n24th in the 50 and 100m backstroke, as\nwell as Benedict Steiner finishing the\n50M fly in 30 seconds dead.\nIt was no doubt an emotional weekend for Sophie Mitchinson swimming\nAnd they\u2019re back this weekend for a team\ntournament\nContinued on page 30\nCyclers crack the\nCliMach X trial\nKristian Jenner\nFor once, everything seemed to be going according to plan as we packed up\nthe minibus in front of the Queen\u2019s\nTower on Friday afternoon. We were\nall there, and so were our bikes, which\nwas a nice change from the previous\ntrip. We set off around 16:15 on our\nepic drive to North Wales looking forward to a weekend of riding the sweet\ntrails round Snowdonia National Park.\nAs we crossed the Welsh border with\nTom Jones blasting out of the speakers,\nthe Daves kept themselves entertained\nby arguing about how to pronounce\nthe Welsh place names, and who could\nremember the way the best. Oh, and\nabout each other\u2019s music tastes. They\nlike arguing.\nWe rolled into Dolgellau (if that\u2019s\nhow you spell it) at an ungodly hour\nand had to drag the receptionist out of\nthe pub to let us into the hostel. Yes,\nthat\u2019s right, we slept in proper beds this\ntime \u2013 a welcome luxury. The only other guests that weekend were a group of\nmates on a stag do, who kindly left us\nsome energy drinks and porn mags in\nthe kitchen. We met them later that\nnight when they came back from their\nnight out enjoying the wild nightlife\nthat Dolgellau has to offer (there\u2019s\nsome great strippers according to the\nguestbook). They later kept us up by\ntrying to beat the shit out of each other\nafter a prank gone wrong, smashing a\nbig hole in the wall. We didn\u2019t see them\nagain.\nThe next day we drove down to the\ntrail centre at Coed-y-Brenin, home\nof the first ever specific mountain\nbike trail in the UK (apparently). As it\nturned out we were half an hour early\nfor breakfast, and passed the time by\nfaffing about with our bikes. We started\nthe ride fuelled up on bacon sandwiches from the cafe, although we didn\u2019t get\nvery far before the first pinch flat. This\nwas the first of around 10 punctures\nwe had in the first couple of hours on\nSaturday. The best one has to be James,\nwho managed to rip his front tyre clean\noff the rim while going through a com-pression. Despite taking down our\naverage speed to around 5 mph, these\nbreaks were a good opportunity to get\nsome photos and for Doug\u2019s trousers to\nmysteriously disappear.\nAs the day went on, we had fewer interruptions and we could really enjoy\nthe awesome riding at Coed-y-Brenin.\nWe were riding \u2018the Beast\u2019, 40 km of\nperfectly bermed, rocky singletrack \u2013\nthe reason we\u2019d come such a long way.\nThis trail really has it all, although it\u2019s\nnot for the faint hearted. The smiles on\nour faces did start to fade a bit spinning\nour way up the last massive climb, only\nto be brought back by the awesome descent on the other side. All I remember\nis working my arse off trying to follow\nDave T down on his shiny new bike,\nonly to watch him endoing round one\nof the corners, wtf??\nBy the time we got back to the cafe\nthere wasn\u2019t enough daylight left to\ndo a whole loop more, so after a short\nbreak we went up to do the first 5 km or\nso of another trail, which turned out to\nhave some sweet berms near the end.\nOn that bombshell we decided to call it\na day and headed back to the hostel.\nAfter a nice warm (sitting-down)\nshower, we headed out to a pub\noutside\nContinued on page 30\nCalling all Hurlers\nFinian McCann\nImperial College GAA are very pleased\nto announce that hurling training sessions have started. They\u2019re on every\nWednesday lunchtime at 2pm in Hyde\nPark beside the tennis courts.

On 2nd April at the London\nsummit when Gordon Brown reveals\nhis 74 page, detailed plan to the EU, the\nEU will most likely follow suit, much\nas the US already have with their plan\nfor new tax cuts, bank injections, fresh\ngovernment investment, 0.25% interest rate, new trade talks and a raft of\nnew financial regulations.\nSo, if governments are responding in\nthe way that history and the textbooks\nsay they should, why is the economy\nstill shrinking? Why is it that every\ntime a world leader unveils more po-lices, the markets drop? Why does no\none seem to think that they will work?\nWell, because they\u2019re the same sort\nof policies that caused this recession in\nthe first place. What was spectacular\nabout the 90\u2019s and the early 00\u2019s was\nthe fact that governments had begun\nadopting a mix of Keynesian and Monetarist policies which actually seemed\nto work. Low interest rates, high government spending, massive globalisation and (relatively) low taxes all\nspurred on new growth unhampered\nby excess regulations.\nHowever, what was really happening\nwas that governments were running\neconomic stimuli to push their economies as hard as they could to keep up\nwith each other, rather than readying\ntheir countries for long term growth.\nAlmost like runners sprinting early in\na race to get to the front, even though\nthere\u2019s a long way to go. Eventually\nthough, like the runners, these plans\nran out of steam as people no longer\nhad any more money to debt finance\nfurther growth, leaving things, as you\nknow, where they are now.\nSo when Obama or Brown or any\nother government announces its remedies for the current situation, they\u2019re\nessentially going through the comic\nbelow.\nWhich, understandably, gets everyone upset. But what really has people\nworried is the fact that this plan is the\nbest that anyone can come up with.\nEveryone from Nobel Prize winning\neconomists to know-it-all university\nnewspaper business editors accept that\nthere isn\u2019t really a lot else that anyone\ncan do. While it\u2019s easy for political\nsnipers to pick apart plans that are laid\nout, those very critics\u2019 (Conservatives,\nRepublicans) own plans are either ef-fectvely the same, or poorly thought\nout. It\u2019s easy for people to talk about\nthe perils of printing money or the\ndangers of public debt but what else\ncan anyone do?\nNothing.\nThe alternative put forward by free\nmarket economists is just to let the\nwhole thing sort itself out and thus\nkeep away from the problem. Claiming\nthat if we allow the central banks to set\nthe rate as they want to, and let governments focus on resolving national\ndebt then everything will eventually\nwork itself out.\nOn the surface it seems like a great\nidea \u2013 we just let the market solve eve-rything, but if you think about it for a\nfew moments, it\u2019s actually a pretty terrible thing to do. By doing nothing we\nwill lose the confidence of the people\nBuffett\u2019s new letter\nto shareholders:\nawesome as usual\nBack in the pre-9/11 days when the\nstock market kept going up and up\nand everything seemed to be going\nalong just swimmingly, there were two\nmandatory readings for every serious\nbusinessman. One was the transcripts\nof Alan Greenspan\u2019s congressional\ntestimonies (Greenspan was the head\nof the US Federal Reserve throughout\nthe 90\u2019s and early 00\u2019s) which were\nlong winded and ridiculously hard to\nunderstand.\nThe other was Warren Buffett\u2019s Letter to Shareholders, the letter sent out\nto investors in his Berkshire Corporation explaining the last years performance and what Buffett thought would\nhappen in future, which has always\nbeen clear and easy to read.\nSince those days Greenspan has had\nto admit that he misinterpreted how\ncapitalism works, whilst Buffett has\ngone on to beat the S&P 500 index by\n27.4%. Berkshire\u2019s book value fell only\n9.6%, compared to a fall of 37% for the\nprices of 500 large, highly tradable,\nUS, company stocks) leaving investors\ncarefully combing through last weeks\nLetter to Investors for anything they\ncould use to help them work out the\nfuture. Luckily for them, Buffett is a\nman who delivers.\nThis year, amongst quaint stories\nabout restaurants with \u201cIn God we\ntrust, all others pay cash\u201d on the walls,\nand bits about birds caught in badminton courts, there were some real pearls\nof wisdom.\nProbably the most important prediction made is the future unwillingness\nof newly bailed out firms to go back\nto the status quo. We have essentially\nstarted to reward firms for failing (at\nleast in the banking sector) and so\neffectively punished those who have\ndone well. While in the short term,\nthis allows the financial systems to\nkeep hobbling along, in the medium\nterm, we\u2019ve wrecked the natural selection system that capitalism relies on.\nNow that banks are getting used to\nbeing bailed out every time they mess\nup, in the longer term they\u2019re going to\nneed more injections just to keep go-ing. On top of that we\u2019re going to be\nbombarded with random and ridiculous requests for help from all sorts\nof other industries and groups. One\ngood example is the ludicrous strike\nfrom unions over \u201cBritish jobs for British Workers\u201d which would never have\nhad a chance of succeeding before the\ncredit crunch, and yet may now be\nmirrored elsewhere.\nThe upshot from all this is a move\naway from straight up capitalism towards a pseudo-capitalist state in\nwhich the government has a big say in\nhow firms operate. For instance, we\u2019ve\nbegun to see new long term, government backed, low interest mortgages\nbeing offered by the newly government\ncontrolled RBS and Northern Rock and\nit is likely that there are more to come.\nWhen firms are bailed out, they become part controlled by a government,\nwho can then exercise their rights by\nforcing firms to do what\u2019s in the nation\u2019s interest, rather than their own\n\u2013 like a watered down form of commu-nism. More and more frequently the\nidea of nationalising institutions seems\nto be brought up subtly and snuck past\nopposing naysayers under the guise of\n\u201cemergency actions\u201d.\nSo it\u2019s possible that we may see the\nend to the free market deregulation\npush that has driven growth for the\nlast 20 years and instead see a return\nto more centralised economics. Not\nthat this will be widely publicised, as\nthe two n-words you can\u2019t say in politics are n****r and nationalisation, but\nit does seem as though governments\nwill be exercising their new ownership\nfor the good of the common man. Or at\nleast, they will in the short term before\npeople figure out that the Government\nis incompetent and force them to give\nup control and deregulate again.\nand lose the confidence of our busi-nesses. Therefore those that can move\nabroad to where they can get benefits\nwill do so, leaving the country weaker,\nwith fewer talented people.\nThe short term pain will also push\nthe country far behind its peers, doing damage to our GDP, employment,\ninfrastructure and human capital that\ncould never be undone by the same\nmarket forces that failed to self-regu-late these last few years. If we let this\ncurrent recession \u201cburn itself out\u201d the\ndamage it will do in the process will be\nirreparable.\nAll of which leaves us trying to solve\nthe problem with the hair of the dog\nthat bit us, almost. Except the new\nstimulus policies put forward all have\none thing that the old growth policies\ndidn\u2019t: regulation.\nChanges to the way that banks work\nand are regulated aren\u2019t really welcome\nby the bankers that will be watched,\neven though they will most likely have\na positive effect on the bankers in ques-tion. Most city folk balk a the idea of\nhaving to operate in a transparent clear\nsystem that allows their competitors to\nwatch what they do, but it is precisely\nthe opaque nature of the derivatives\nand securities markets that makes\nthem so dangerous and when you think\nabout it, it makes perfect sense for risk\nproducts to be transparently traded.\nDerivatives exist to transfer risk from\none place to another, but if you can\u2019t\nsee how risk is being allocated in the\nopen market, then you can\u2019t make an\neffective assessment on how much risk\nreally costs, turning a potentially useful\ntool into a big gambling match. One of\nthe things that makes this whole financial meltdown so potent is the fact that\nnone of the banks involved has a truly\naccurate understanding of what their\ninstrument investments are \u2013 something which has to change.\nAnd extra government investment\nisn\u2019t all bad news either. If it\u2019s properly managed it could tackle some\npre-existing problems that we\u2019ve taken\ntoo long to get around to. Currently\nthe UK ranks 24th in terms of basic\nrequirement provision, which puts\nus below Cyprus \u2013 a country with\nless than three quarters our GDP per\ncapita. With some well placed extra\nspending the UK has the chance to develop its key infrastructure into what\nit should be. Of course, all this hinges\non the idea that the government won\u2019t\nwaste the money it should be using to\nfix things, which is patently absurd.\nSo that\u2019s it. The current economic\nplan is to do a lot more of what we\u2019ve\nbeen doing already but keep more of\nan eye on things. Awesome.\nForget about LOLCATZ, we now have LOLBAMAS\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics\nPolitics Editors \u2013 James Goldsack & Katya-yani Vyas\nMr. Burns showing what seems to be, amongst the high-powered, an archetypal greed for money\nCorruption pervades the workplace\nPrime minister Gordon Brown signals his desire for cooperation with the US to solve the financial crisis\nHassan Joudi\nJames Goldsack\nPolitics Editor\nIn 2004 the US suffered from $525m\nworth of robberies in street crime.\nHowever in the same year an estimated\n$600bn was stolen through employee\ntheft and fraud in the workplace in\nwhite-collar crime. Noting the \u2018bn\u2019 on\nthat second figure, the latter is greater\nby a factor of a thousand.\nAlthough muggers on the streets or\nopportunist burglars roaming quiet\nresidential roads are criminals that society detests, what really costs us dear\nare the educated workers in suits sitting\ncomfortably in their offices, embezzling money, giving bribes and practicing \u201ccreative accounting.\u201d Perhaps the\nmost high profile piece of \u201ccreative\naccounting\u201d in living memory must be\nthat which caused the collapse of Enron \u2013 an American energy company \u2013\nin 2001, when the manipulation of its\naccounts was made public, causing its\nshare price to plummet and forcing it\nto file for bankruptcy.\nThe US congress, partly in response\nto Enron\u2019s collapse, passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The legislation attempted to limit the interaction\nof congressmen with businessmen\nand lobbyists by, for example, banning\nserving free meals to congressmen at\n\u201cwidely attended functions\u201d and giving\nfree flights in \u201cfixed-wing aircrafts.\u201d\nInstead businessmen and lobbyists\ncircumvented the rules with limited\nfunctions with guest lists, and by flying\ncongressmen in helicopters.\nCorruption in government is a form\nof white-collar crime too and is often\ncalled \u2018sleaze\u2019, a term coined by the British press to describe political scandals\ninvolving corruption during the 1980s\nand 1990s. Government sleaze is perhaps worse than corporate corruption\nbecause the money it involves belongs\nto taxpayers rather than private share-holders. Sleaze is certainly not new to\nBritish politics; in fact sleaze was one\nof the factors that caused the defeat\nof the Conservative Party in the 1997\ngeneral election to the Labour Party.\nBut despite their rebranding as \u201cNew\nLabour\u201d and Tony Blair\u2019s promise that\nthey would be \u201cwhiter than white,\u201d the\nLabour Party has suffered its fair share\nof sleaze accusations over the past dec-ade. From the tobacco in a F1 advertising scandal with Bernie Ecclestone\nmonths after victory in 1997 to the police questioning of Lord Levy in 2006\nto Peter Mandelson meeting Russian\nbillionaires on a luxury yatch in 2008,\nit could be argued that Labour have\nbeen more corrupt while in office than\nthe Conservatives.\nAnd recently sleaze stories have continued to emanate from Westminster\nlike snot balls from a runny nose. The\nSunday Times investigation in January\n2009 found that several peers offered\nto amend laws in the House of Lords\nin favour of certain businesses and engineering companies in return for cash\npayments of up to \u00a3100,000. Moreover on 20th January, the day President\nObama was inaugurated in the US, the\nHouse of Commons was about to vote\non a bill preventing the publishing of\nMPs\u2019 expenses receipts under the Freedom of Information Act by giving MPs\na protected status. Critics were sceptical saying the proposed changes were\ndeliberately announced that day to\nbury bad news.\nCabinet ministers, MPs and civil\nservants are in unique positions to\ncommit corrupt acts for their own interests because their job exposes them\nto such opportunities on a daily basis.\nPolitical parties need funding from\ngenerous donors, MPs have allowances to spend and government departments have contracts to award. This\nwas beautifully captured in a scene\nfrom The Simpsons Movie (2007) when\nthe residents of Springfield were first\ntrapped inside the giant glass dome.\nOn a huge screen the head of EPA (En-vironmental Protection Agency) says\nthe dome is the last thing they wanted\nto do, before adding, \u201cWell I do own\nthe company that makes the dome, but\nthat\u2019s beside the point.\u201d This echoes the\nusual sentiments of Simpson\u2019s regular,\nMr. Burns.\nIn Islam there is a beautiful story\ninvolving Imam Ali (A.S) during his\ntime as leader of the Muslim Umma\n(nation). While working in the Treasury of the Islamic state, he was visited\none day by two men. Upon their arrival he extinguished one candle that\nwas lighting the room and lit another.\nBefore starting their business the two\nmen asked the Imam why he did this.\nThe Imam replied, \u201cThat was a candle\nbought of Treasury funds. As long as\nI worked for the Treasury, I used it.\nNow you have come for some personal\nwork, so I use the candle bought of my\npersonal fund.\u201d\nThere is absolutely no doubt that it\nis difficult to implement such a high\nmoral standard in our daily lives, and\nwith many Imperial students progressing to high-flying jobs in business and\ngovernment after graduation, many of\nus will face opportunities like those\nmentioned in this article. Let us not\nabandon our integrity and give in to\nthe corruption to become like the head\nof the EPA.\nGordon Brown urges US to \u2018seize the moment\u2019\nGordon Brown, only the fifth UK prime\nminister to address both houses on\nCapitol Hill, will urge the US to \u201cseize\nthe moment\u201d to \u201cmake the future work\nfor us\u201d. The Prime Minister is facing\ngrowing media pressure to apologise\nfor the state of the economy. Despite\nso far declining to do so, he said \u201chumility\u201d and \u201ccollective responsibility\u201d\nwere always needed. He said: \u201cthis is\n[not] a British problem that was a British government mistake, as everybody\nunderstands, the whole global financial\nsystem seized up.\u201d\nGordon Brown said he was not sure\na British regulatory system could have\npicked up the problems because of the\nglobal scale. International cooperation and supervision would be needed.\n\u201cWe should have been tougher in some\nareas but we have got to remember, of\ncourse, that when it comes to the sub\nprime mortgages which ended up in\nthe ownership of British banks, that\u2019s\nsomething that happened in America,\nthe risk was also passed on but they\nwere rated as triple-A products \u201d he\nsaid.\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s close ally Ed\nBalls said, of the regulatory system, \u201cin\nretrospect, it is clear we were nowhere\nnear tough enough\u201d.\nIn the speech, Gordon Brown will tell\nCongress that \u201cnow more than ever the\nrest of the world wants to work with\nyou\u201d and will say the major challenges\nfaced are global challenges.\n\u201cAnd let me say that you now have the\nmost pro-American European leadership in living memory. A leadership\nthat wants to cooperate more closely\ntogether, in order to be a stronger partner for you. There is no old Europe, no\nnew Europe, there is only your friend\nEurope. So once again I say we should\nseize the moment \u2013 because never before have I seen a world so willing to\ncome together. Never before has that\nbeen more needed,\u201d\nAfter a meeting between Barack\nObama and Gordon Brown on Tuesday, the US president said the \u201cspecial\nrelationship\u201d between the countries\nwould \u201conly grow stronger\u201d.\nAfter about an hour of talks at the\nWhite House, Mr Brown and Mr\nObama said they agreed that improvements were needed to the regulation of\nthe global banking system. Mr Brown\nsaid the two countries were pursuing\na \u201ccommon interest\u201d in a \u201cglobal new\ndeal\u201d.\nMr Obama warned that countries\nshould not \u201cproject inwards\u201d by encouraging protectionism. Gordon\nBrown has also said that world leaders needed to \u201cenlist all the energies of\npeople in different parts of the world to\ndeal with problems that we all face\u201d.\n\n"

    "content": "B\neing a man used to be infinitely easier. Ever since\nwe have hit the debauched\nand certifiably unstable\nnoughties, things seem to\nhave gotten a hell of a lot tougher. The\ncosmetic issues which a man is preo-cuppying himself as of late are wildly\ndifferent (but not necessarily less im-portant) to anything previously experi-enced. While the infamous metrosexual term dubbed by the prominent Mark\nSimpson in an issue of a mid nineties\nIndependent has been strong before,\nonly now can we feel the full force of\nthis gail.\nShelves at Harrod\u2019s, Selfridge\u2019s, Harvey Nich\u2019s et al, are lined with androg-enous beauty products that are capable\nof befundling even the most informed\nand liberal of men. A tinted mosituriser\nby Jean Paul Gaultier is no longer the\ndomain of the female species and men-only spas and salons are cropping up\nlike mushrooms in the unlikelist places\nacross the country; from Blackpool and\nPreston to the deepest, darkest Surrey\nand Cumbria. Not all men (or women\nfor that matter) are fully comfortable\nor content with this increase in personal grooming or changed aesthetic\nvalues. Some find it feminine that a guy\nwould care about skin. I\u2019m not totally\nobsessed, but it would be a lie if I said\nI didn\u2019t care. I scrub and I moisturise,\nbut that\u2019s about it.\nDespite the complicated environment that the modern man has been\nthrown into, there are still three key\nthings that any male should absolutely\nknow how to do. Regardless of wealth,\nsocial status or pikeyness level, these\nare the crux of what can really make a\nman. Apart from the first one, they are\nin no order of importance and I stand\nby that they deserve equal recognition\nas far as manliness goes.\nThe most basic is the most impor-tant. Even if you are a high powered\nCEO who gets his shoes waxed, polished and shone in front of 85 Broad\nStreet in New York City, it is still vitaly\nimportant that you know how to do it\nyourself. Not because there isn\u2019t anyone else to do it for you, but it truly is\nthe epitome of being a dude. It\u2019s really\nnot difficult and there is some sort of\nsatisfaction that can be obtained from\nspending a lazy Sunday afternoon taking care of your shoes. If well treated,\nany expensive pair of shoes has the\npotential to last at least 5 years, irrespective of how often they are worn.\nI suggest you run a hot bath and leave\nyour shoes for 20 minutes just sitting in\nthe steamed up room. Commence by\ncleaning the dirt using a shoeshining\nbrush. When this is done, using a paper clip and a toothbrush clean out the\nbrogues and apply the right coloured\npolish or clear wax to the entire shoe\nin a circular motion. Wait about 20\nminutes and brush again. Using an old\nT-shirt, buff the shoe until it is shining\nbeautifully. Easy. Fast. Manly. Do it.\nThe handiman in you naturally\njumps up and down with unadulterated excitement when a fuse blows.\nEven though you may know nothing\nabout changing a fuse or have never\nattempted the most softcore DIY task,\nthis is your time to be elevated in the\nman world. You proudly claim, \u201cIt\u2019s got\nto be the fuse. I will change this fuse,\nand then I will change the world\u201d. And\nthen, you realise you can\u2019t do it, so I\u2019m\nhere to save you. It literally is as simple\nas 1, 2, 3. Turn your fusebox off, remove the malfunctioning fuse by pulling it out and insert the new one into\nthe base. Despite this being an effort\nof unprecedented proportions, it will\nlift your spirits and it is possible that\nyou will walk around with testosterone\ncoming out of your ears for the rest of\nthe day. I know I do. It also makes for\nan interesting auditory experience.\nLast, but just as important, is the\nability to properly iron a shirt. Usually,\nthere is always someone to do it for you,\nbe it a a dry cleaner, your mother, wife,\ndaughter, whatever... Granted, this is\nnot as manly as changing a car carbu-rator, but it can take you almost as far\nin some weird metaphorical sense I\u2019m\nnot fully sure I comprehend. This is the\nart of ironing a shirt to perfection. It\u2019s a\nlittle tricker than the other two but in\nterms of sartorial knowledge, it doesn\u2019t\nget much better than this. Unbotton\nthe shirt and lay it on the board, chest\nside up and begin at the tip of the collar working inwards towards the mid-dle. Iron the yoke on the thinner end\nof the board and repeat on the second\nshoulder. Cuffs are easy; open then and\niron them fully. Now, slip the shirt over\nthe board and iron the back. Repeat if\nthere are creases.\nYou are now a man. Go live your life.\nD\ninner was cooked. We\nhad decided, for once, to\nmake a shared meal. We\nsplit the cost, the workload and the cooking.\nThere was a warm sense of altruism\nas we sat down at the table. We were\nfinally forming a tight friendship. As I\ntook my first bite of the meal, dipping\nmy head low to the plate, I\u2019m suddenly\ndistracted by the general sogginess of\nthe food. \u201cNeeds brown sauce!\u201d announced a voice from my right. \u201cNo,\nit needs soy sauce,\u201d exclaims a voice to\nmy left in disagreement. As I evaluate\nthis return of statements like a spectator at Wimbledon, my friend sitting\nopposite pipes up. \u201cWell, I think its\u2026.\u201d\nThe other three of us gaze at her momentarily as we wait for her to finish\nher sentence. There was no verbal fin-ish, but a rotating jiggle of a pointed\nhand towards her cheek, as she grins\nmanically. Our gazes turned to frowns\nof utter confusion.\nShe gauged our reactions and quickly\nwent onto explain that it was a childish gesture in Italy that signals when\nsomething is \u2018yummy\u2019. You can probably guess that the guy that thought\nour food needed brown sauce was\nfrom the North. The girl that disagreed\nand claimed soy sauce would solve the\nbleak blandness of our meal grew up in\nDan Wan gets stuck in the middle of everything\n\u201cHence, a natural\ninstinct for ease\nand comfort has\nbecome referred\nto as \u2018a cultural\ndivide\u2019\u201d\nBeijing. There was actually meant to be\na fifth friend joining us for dinner that\nnight, but he was off getting hammered\non a boat with other Medics.\nThat little story (to call it an anecdote would be pushing it) recounts one\nof the first instances at Imperial that I\nnoticed a culture difference. Imperial\nCollege prides itself on being one of\nthe most culturally diverse universities\nin the UK, and there is no doubt that it\nshould be celebrated.\nAs I grew into the very international\nsurroundings of Imperial folk, I have\ngrown to realise there are divides within the student population. I think many\nother people have realised the same,\nbut realisation does not necessarily infer vocalisation of the matter. Divides\nare not healthy.\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious: Medics\nversus the rest of College. As proven\nat my dinner, the absent person was\nat a Medic Freshers\u2019 event, on a boat,\nprobably making his very best friends\nfor the next six years. Varsity also happened recently, and it did nothing to\ndampen the rivalry. However, it\u2019s a rivalry that does little harm to the social\nfabric of Imperial. My best mate from\nFreshers\u2019 Year is a dirty Medic, and as\nhe wanders into the SAF once a fortnight like he\u2019s the Don of South Kensington, I don\u2019t feel any acrimony towards him. In fact, I see it as a pleasant\nsurprise that I haven\u2019t had to schedule\n\u2018lunch\u2019 with him.\nBut this is where I struggle to com-prehend. It is obvious that Imperial has\nsome of the brightest students from\nthe South East Asian region. My parents are of Malaysian descent, but I was\nborn and raised in Watford; about as far\naway from Malaysia you can get. What\nthis gives me is a good understanding of\nboth cultures I believe prevalent at Imperial. There is the Western culture that\nI have grown up in, but there is also a\nvery different culture. A lot of students\nthat have had their schooling solely in\ncountries such as Hong Kong or China\nunderstandably have the same needs,\nhabits and essentially lifestyle. Hence,\nthere is a natural divide in culture.\nIt is not a divide I have any disdain\nfor, though, as I can appreciate the issues and circumstances one is faced\nwith when moving to a foreign coun-try. No one can deny that when placed\nin a similar situation (for example an\nEnglish student moved to China) the\neasiest and most comfortable option\nwould be initially to stick around with\nother Western-raised people. A common bond is found in uncertainty,\nand this is where long friendships are\nmade. Already, purely out of comfort,\nyou would have made a hazy but slight\nseparation from you and the general\nmass. Due to Imperial\u2019s 34% international student proportion, this hazy\nseparation is not small. It occurs on a\nlarger scale. Hence, a natural instinct\nfor ease and comfort becomes \u2018a cultural divide\u2019.\nDuring Freshers\u2019 Week, it became an\namusing experience to watch international students approach me expecting\nme to share their background. Many\nwere perplexed at the idea that I\u2019d rather speak in English, with my uninhibited colloquial slang littered through\neach of my sentences. Explaining why\nI was using the word \u2018sick\u2019 to describe\nsomething good became a tedious task.\nI\u2019ve since stopped using the term.\nI didn\u2019t feel comfortable when they\ngauged each other\u2019s hometown for the\nvery first time. They reminisced about\nplaces \u2018back home\u2019 I should know, but\ndidn\u2019t. My sporadic interjections about\nthe quite honestly culturally pale arse-end of Watford were met by silence\nand polite chuckling before they swiftly\nmoved back on the subject of the Racecourse at Happy Valley, Hong Kong.\nI\u2019d rather talk to someone from the\nLondon area, who knows about where\nI grew up (it usually ends in humiliating laughter). But there you go; it\nproves everyone, including me, prefers\ncomfort in cultural familiarity when\nfaced with a socially clean slate that is\nFreshers\u2019 Week.\nOf course, though, there are the\nbrave ones; the ones that have the confidence to approach anyone and everyone without hesitation and a fear of\nnot being understood. They are ones\nthat do not need the comforts of their\nhomeland through their friends. To\nthose people out there, I firmly salute\nyou. Sadly, I\u2019m not one of those peo-ple, because despite my interest in\nwildly different cultures to my own, I\nwill probably never properly integrate\nmyself into one.\nI\u2019m stuck in the middle, but I don\u2019t\nbegrudge my mismatch of ancestry and\nupbringing. It allows me to appreciate\nboth sides of this natural divide. However, the word \u2018divide\u2019, I feel, infers a\nsense of detrimental isolation. So maybe \u2018divide\u2019 is too strong a word to be\nusing to describe a culture difference\nseen in every society on every scale.\nImperial sees the effects enlarged, due\nto it being such small, compact body of\nstudents in South Kensington.\nThere is simply an emphasised natural divide within the student body\nwhich no one can blame. However, I\nstill don\u2019t understand why my Northern friend from dinner that night\nthought brown sauce was the answer\nto egg fried rice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be the\nfuse. I will change\nthis fuse and then,\nI will change the\nworld\u201d\nTwo hundred years ago, Charles Robert Darwin was born in Shrewsbury,\na small town in the west of England.\nHis theory of evolution by natural selection was to cause upheavals during\nhis lifetime. Today a strange awe still\nsurrounds his name. His life and work\ncontinue to inspire strong emotions\nin many people, ranging from disgust,\nthrough bafflement, to reverence. He\nis praised as an inspiration and slan-derously misrepresented in equal\nmeasure.\nOf all the great post-enlightenment\nthinkers (and believe me, Darwin spent\nmost of his life in deep thought) he has\nhad perhaps the biggest impact on\npresent day thinking. Isaac Newton\u2019s\nsupporters might cite his fundamental\nlaws of physics; those of Einstein rela-tivity; Faraday\u2019s electricity; and so on.\nBut to Darwin and Darwin alone we\nowe a single \u2013 and \u201cbeguilingly simple\u201d\naccording to Richard Dawkins \u2013 all-encompassing idea to explain life in\nits many forms and guises; as the 20th\ncentury evolutionary biologist Theodore Dobzhansky poetically put it;\n\u201cNothing in biology makes sense, except\nin the light of evolution.\u201d\nBut I want to put Darwin\u2019s achievements in some kind of modern-day\ncontext. After all, this is not a static,\nstale piece of history but an idea that\nhas constantly shifted, been added to,\nadapted, and rigorously tested \u2013 and\nnever found wanting. One might say\nthat the theory encapsulates everything it describes; others have arisen\nbut withered in the face of evidence\nand scientific advance, whereas natural\nselection has proved itself to be the fittest over the long haul; thus it survives\nintact, 150 years after Darwin first\npublished \u201cOn the Origin of Species\u201d.\nSo what can Darwin\u2019s \u201cdangerous\nidea\u201d \u2013 in Daniel Dennett\u2019s words \u2013 still\nteach us? In the most basic philosophical terms, it replaced the prevailing\nChristian view of humans as stewards,\nmasters of all they see, created by God\nto protect and prevail over nature as\nthey wish. In its place, evolution brings\nthe uncomfortable (for some) truth\nthat we are not intrinsically special,\nbut just another twig on the tree of life;\nour cousins scuttle, scurry and fly all\naround us; our ancestors lie fossilised\ndeep beneath us. Of course, Darwin\nhimself put it best in \u201cThe Origin\u201d:\n\u201cWhen I view all beings not as special\ncreations, but as the lineal descendants\nof some few beings which lived long\nbefore the first bed of the Cambrian\nsystem was deposited, they seem to me\nto become ennobled.\u201d\nThis concept of nature encompassing\nhumanity,althoughonlyhintedatinhis\ngreat work, is perhaps Darwin\u2019s most\nvital contribution to conservation.\nHow about the more practical side\nof things? After all, Darwin posited a\nhypothesis for the great diversity of\nlife on earth, but did he contribute\nanything towards saving it from crisis?\nMaybe not directly; he was a man of\nhis times, and collecting in those days\ninvolved a \u201cshoot first, ask questions\nlater\u201d approach to the study of natural\nhistory. But numerous quotes point to\nthe fact that Darwin\u2019s theory hinges on\nhow populations of animals or plants\nreact to great stress. For example, in\nthe chapter on Natural Selection he\nintroduces the idea of environmental\nchange:\n\u201cWe shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing\nsome physical change, for instance, of\nclimate. The proportional numbers of\nits inhabitant would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct\u201d.\nEven the concept of extinction was\ncontroversial in early 19th century England, when species were still thought to\nbe immutable. But Darwin could not\nignore the vast amount of evidence he\nfound on his travels and from looking\nat fossils and rocks \u2013 species had existed in the past that were not around\ntoday. He continued; \u201cRarity, as geology tells us, is the precursor to extinction\u201d. And, as if to drill the point home,\nin chapter ten he wrote: \u201cSpecies once\nlost do not reappear\u201d.\nSo Darwin not only introduced the\nradical idea that species could disappear just as easily as they came into\nexistence; he encapsulated two of the\nmost pressing issues facing contemporary conservation; rarity and environmental change. Many scientists\nnow talk of a \u201cSixth Mass Extinction\u201d,\nwith unprecedented rates of biodiversity loss \u2013 but without Darwin\u2019s\ninsight, this way of thinking would be\nincomprehensible.\nConservation science as a discipline\nonly really took off towards the end\nof the 20th century, and it relies heavily on applying methods developed by\nevolutionary biologists in the so-called\n\u2018New Synthesis\u2019. Population genetics\nand the discovery of DNA has allowed\nus to better appreciate what defines a\nspecies, how small populations can\nprosper, and whether species, communities and ecosystems can adapt to\nrapid changes in habitats and climate.\nAgain, none of this would have been\npossible without Darwin.\nIt is likely that our current state of affairs would have dismayed him. After\nall, even the catalyst for his theory, the\nGalapagos Islands, is under threat from\ntourism. (tinyurl.com/c9awob)\nHe would certainly be aghast at the\nrejection of science by vast numbers\nof the public, both his own theory (ti-Celebrating 200 years of Charles Darwin\nFelix Whitton\nScience Correspondent\nSchizophrenia genes found\nNew research carried out by Imperial College in conjunction with GlaxoSmithKline has revealed that Schizophrenia could be caused by faulty\nsignalling in the brain.\nIn the largest study ever conducted,\nresearchers looked at brain samples\ndonated by people with the condition\nand identified 49 genes that work differently in brains belonging to schizophrenia sufferers, according to new\nresearch published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.\nCurrent theories behind schizophrenia believe that it could be a result of\nthe brain producing too much of the\nchemical dopamine (since drugs that\nblock dopamine are an effective treatment for the condition), or that the\nprotective myelin sheath which surrounds nerve cells is damaged in sufferers of the disease. However, this\nnew study found that the genes for\nboth dopamine and myelin appear to\nbe acting normally in schizophrenia\npatients and seem to suggest that the\ndisease instead involves abnormalities in the way cells communicate with\neach other.\nThe disease affects around one in\nevery 100 people and although suf-nyurl.com/b42n4o) and the more general flat-earth-ism of climate change\ndeniers.\nBut I think there would also be much\nto delight him. Popular figures such as\nDavid Attenborough (tinyurl.com/dy8-kj7), himself inspired by Darwin, strive\nto communicate the beauty of nature,\nand in doing so educate future generations of conservationists. He would no\ndoubt be amused by belated apologies from the Anglican and Catholic\nchurches for their awkward treatment\nof his theory over the years (tinyurl.\ncom/b8kzva). And he would no doubt\ndismiss as puerile the fabricated debate\nbetween evolution and religion, much\nas he did during his own lifetime.\nMost of all, his theory continues to\nevolve, and is today more wide-reach-ing and powerful than at any time in\nthe past.\nSo today let us forget the dismal conclusions and revel in the words with\nwhich Darwin ended \u201cThe Origin\u201d, and\nwhich always send a shiver down my\nspine:\n\u201cThere is grandeur in this view of life,\nwith its several powers, having been\noriginally breathed into a few forms or\ninto one; and that, whilst this planet\nhas gone cycling on according to the\nfixed law of gravity, from so simple a\nbeginning endless forms most beautiful\nand most wonderful have been, and are\nbeing, evolved.\u201d\nferers experience little physical effect\non the brain, they can have a range\nof symptoms from hallucinations to\nlack of motivation and impaired social\nfunctioning. Better understanding of\nhow the disease affects patients could\nlead to improved treatments and earlier diagnosis of the condition.\nProfessor Jackie de Belleroche, from\nImperial College and an author of the\npaper has said: \u201cThe first step towards\nbetter treatment for schizophrenia is\nto really understand what is going on,\nto find out what genes are involved and\nwhat they are doing.

Up until this point I\nhad only read 1 book be-fore. Well besides the Biff\nand Chip collection at primary school.\nThat book was harry potter! Then the\nmovies came out and I gave up. Well\nthe book I read was Oscar wild\u2019s short\nstories. Yes I know it was written for\nchildren, but it was really really good.\nWhen I say this I mean it! It\u2019s not often I read in general, heck I struggle to\nread my own lecture notes (but that is\nmost likely due to my bad hand writ-ing). Point being, I don\u2019t consider reading literature an important part of my\nlife. I also imagine many of you do the\nsame. Sure I know lots of people read\nbooks nightly, however I am sure many\npeople just don\u2019t bother like me. Why\nwouldthey,Icanbetyouthatmorepeo-ple at imperial have a laptop (or com-puter) than a book to reed at night. In\nconjunction with the interwebz, there\nis a plethora of interesting material to\nreed. Wether it be the latest blog post\nby Stephen Fry, or the news. It would\nseem the printed word is becoming\nobsolete. I can\u2019t begin to imagine a day\nwhere this newspaper (felix incase you\nRavi Pall\nCoffee Break Editor\nhad forgotten) becomes an online pub-lication. This would be unfortunate,\nhowever with news also breaking out\nin competition (read Live), the only\nsaving grace I can see is the fact felix is\nfree. Let me assure you, it will continue\nto be free and awesome. My point here\nis that there will come a point where\nbooks will become obsolete. Have you\nguys ever heard of Amazons Kindle\nII? Is a sweet slim line device made\nby Amazon, that had wireless broadband built in. It connect directly to the\namazon store and downloads any book\nthey have available. Using the large E\nInk screen when the page is loaded, it\nuses no battery. Practically the same\nas a book right\u201d? The difference is this\ntime you have access to thousands of\nbooks in one device. It can also read\nthe books out to you! Who knows, all\nI\u2019m saying is that I enjoyed reading a\nbook, and I may make things easier for\nme and buy an audio book.\nIn other news, have you seen all the\ntexts we got in from the rugby team.\nLOLZ.

There are peculiar customs and bizarre\nrituals, we have annual\ndinners and like all good Gentlemen\u2019s\nClubs it is\u2026 well, 100% gentlemen. We\nfulfill all the basic requirements.\nHowever in other ways it\u2019s very dif-ferent. It doesn\u2019t have a long or prestigious history, Churchill was never a\nmember and Lord knows (as do any\nvisitors to our flat) that the premises\naren\u2019t exactly grandiose.\nIt\u2019s for this reason I believe that my\nclub, hereby named The House of\nTight Trousers, hasn\u2019t been a riotous\nhit amongst the great and good of London. All Gentlemen\u2019s Clubs are judged\non two things: their facilities and their\nmembership. Nobody wants to spend\ntime with a horde of boorish, shallow\nfools (no matter how wonderful the\nsurroundings) but equally one can always take good company with one if\nthe premises aren\u2019t up to scratch.\nI\u2019d say that my club wouldn\u2019t be\njudged too harshly by its member-ship. Admittedly there are only three\nof us: myself, Rob and Carlos. But it\u2019s\nmulti-ethnic, multi-national and mul-tifaith and although I live with a man\nwho never stops revising and a man\nwho never rises before 3pm, I like to\nthink that if you came to The House\nof Tight Trousers for some company\nand conversation, you wouldn\u2019t be\ndisappointed.\nSadly though, the environment\nmight permanently deter you. The\nclub doesn\u2019t employ a cleaner and 66%\nof its members are unable to find the\nstrength to tidy up after themselves.\nThe result is, of course, chaos (not the\norganized chaos of say an anarchist\ncommune, we\u2019re talking a kind of 2003\npost-invasion Iraq type of chaos ). Like\n2003 post-invasion Iraq different areas\nof the club are maintained to different\nstandards. Rob\u2019s room has avoided the\nchaos of the rest of the flat; it is a veritable oasis of cleanliness, structure and\ngeneral civility (Carlos and I suspect\nthat this is linked to the fact that he\u2019s\nthe only one in the flat with any storage space: there are two wardrobes in\nour flat, both in Rob\u2019s room; that and\nthe fact that his room is in the Green\nZone). Carlos\u2019 room on the other hand\nis the absolute opposite of Rob\u2019s room;\nif Rob\u2019s room is the well-protected oil\nwells and pipelines of Iraq then Carlos\u2019\nroom is the Iraqi National Museum. He\nis at a disadvantage, I\u2019ll admit, in that\nhe has the smallest room but the most\nclothes by a long way. His room has become a jungle; his clothes racks are the\ntrees, the hangers are the branches and\nthe leaves are brightly coloured socks\nfrom Uniqlo or American Apparel.\nPerhaps our club might be judged\nbetter if the rest of the flat resembled\nRob\u2019s room rather than Carlos\u2019. At first\nRob\u2019s constitution was strong enough\nto keep The House of Tight Trousers to\na certain standard but the weight of his\nflatmates\u2019 slovenliness overwhelmed\nhim; like the British in Basra he now\nonly keeps order within his base.\nEven if The House of Trouser were to\nbe cleaned spotlessly, like Iraq it would\nstill face problems due to poor infra-structure. There is an extreme shortage of working appliances. We lack a\nfreezer, the hoover seems to expel more\ndust than it inhales and the door of the\nwashing machine has to be prised open\nwith a knife. However, there are two\nappliances that truly make me reconsider not taking that flight to Baghdad;\nthe dryer and the boiler.\nI should correct myself, there is no\ndryer and there never was a dryer.\nThe dryer is the WMD of The House\nof Tight Trousers. I look at images of\nIraqis queuing in the unrepentant heat\nfor petrol and I dream of a life with\ndry clothes. I dream of a world where\nmy clothes didn\u2019t cling uncomfortably\nto my shoulders and where the first 3\nhours of each day weren\u2019t spent shivering as my body struggles with its new\njob as a radiator... wonderful.\nBut surely, I hear you cry, you could\njust dry your clothes on an actual ra-diator? Sadly not, I reply, since the\nboiler has shuffled off its mortal coil\nand departed to boiler heaven. I have\ncold radiators and even colder show-ers. Thrilling as cold showers may be,\nthere is something distinctly unsatisfying about moving from a cold shower\nto a damp towel, before \u2018slipping\u2019 into\neven damper socks and jeans.\nThe atmosphere therefore at The\nHouse of Tight Trousers is as you may\nhave guessed it... damp. Visitors view\nthe piles of dry, unwashed clothing or\nclean but damp clothing with suspi-cion, as if insurgents might suddenly\nleap from behind them.

With\nGoogle proving surprisingly uncooperative and my reference books located\nin another country, the only way I can\ncontinue with my train of thought and\nfinish this story with any degree of\ncoherence is to invent an appropriate\nsubstitute. So be it. Sir Darcy Wilberforce St. John deLaney Hamilton, Bart.\nthat well-known member of the landed\ngentry, ranked among the great artistic souls of his day. His infusion with\nthe divine fire is often attributed to his\nwealthy mother, who insisted that her\npregnancy be spent in the presence of\ngreat works of art: soothing glissandos\ndelivered by periwigged pimpernels on\nharps, elegant marble statuettes, fine\nwatercolours and the most refined to-piary. Bear in mind that much of this\ncomes to you straight and unfiltered\nfrom a notoriously unreliable memory.\nIf one of the greatest musical geniuses\nof the age was the product of such refined practices on the part of the elder\nMrs. Hamilton, then my own mother\u2019s\nnine-month must have involved long\nperiods of silence, punctuated by occasional bouts of atonal shrieking\nfrom my father as he danced around\nher while whamming two metal frying\npans together with a ladle.\nI must stop before I do them an in-justice. Music has always played an\nimportant part in our home \u2013 but we\nhave never played an important part in\nthe music. On my father\u2019s side I am the\nproduct of four generations of musical\nimbecility, with the more harmonious\nstrands of our DNA having jumped\nship somewhere in the transition from\nthe stetls of Lithuania to the stetls of\nthe Ukraine. On my mother\u2019s side the\naccident occurred more recently, as my\ngrandfather\u2019s vocal inheritance is proving strangely elusive.\nI think a key factor in all this \u2013 or\nmore likely still, an off-key factor \u2013 is\nthat the first sound I ever heard was\na 10 pound baby tearing his lungs out\nin an attempt to gain attention from a\nhostile world. With that sort of introduction to the mesmerizing world of\nsound, is there any wonder I have no\nsense of musical proportion?\nMy tonal eccentricities are well-known to most of my friends and all of\nmy enemies. As a result, I am usually\nforbidden to approach the microphone\non karaoke evenings, and am only allowed out of the closet to reluctantly\ndeliver my highly sought-after imitation of Sir Mixalot in idiosyncratic\ntones.\nThe situation is aggravated by one\nof those tragic twists of fate which has\nensured that all of my friends seem to\nhave dangerously overdeveloped musical glands. I have two friends who\nare concert violinsts, a third is a gifted\nflautist who currently conducts the orchestra of a prestigious London univer-sity, and sopranos, tenors and baritones\ncrowd for space on my facebook friends\nlist. To rub salt, pepper and a hint of\ntarragon yet further into the wound my\nflatmate, in an attempt to become acquainted with one instrument of every\nfamily, has recently started learning\nthe cello. I alone of my acquaintances\nreceive pitying glances and sorrowful\nembraces from friends and family when\ncircumstances compel me to break into\n\u2018Happy Birthday\u2019\n. No-one else receives\nthe raised eyebrow or the quivering upturned lip of barely concealed laughter\nas they produce vague humming sounds\nin an attempt to recapture a particularly\nstirring movement in a piece of classical\nmusic. Years of self-confidence have at\nleast ensured that I make up in gusto for\nwhat I lack in talent, but the embarrassment remains.\nThis embarrassment is irrational\nand all-consuming. Where no music\nof any kind is involved, I can interact\nwith any of the above-mentioned virtual virtuosi with the greatest of ease.\nI can discuss literature and philosophy,\nquote sitcoms and web memes, don an\nair of loving condescension or ironic\ndetachment and generally proselytize,\npontificate and pun to my heart\u2019s de-light. The moment a bow is raised, a\nthroat cleared or a middle C pressed,\nhowever, my ego goes the way of the\nstock market and I become a dribbling\nsycophant with a gift for words surpassed by most species of canary.\nAn intense feeling of inferiority sets\nin \u2013 and rightly so. These individuals can do more with the emotions of\nan audience than I will ever be able to\nachieve in any other way. By playing on\ntheir instruments they can play directly on human heartstrings. No other\nartform has so true a course through\nthe emotional centres of our brains,\nand no other artist can achieve so\nmuch with what seems to be so little.\nI cannot, in good faith, take a dislike to\npeople who can play an instrument as I\nknow that within the space of four bars\nmy respect for them will be soaring to\nthe B above high C. If there is one ability I have ever admired and envied and\ncraved for my own it is the opportunity\nto produce music.\nAnd so, after ten years of salivating\nover instruments of all shapes and siz-es, I have finally decided to give it a go.\nI enter the vast unexplored jungle of\naccidental notes and tangled staves, of\ndominant chords and elusive sevenths\narmed with nothing but a battered music notebook and sensible shoes.\nTune in next week, same time, same\nplace, to hear what happens next. Be\nwarned though \u2013 it may not be so easy\non the ears.\nI\nt has been a strange week here at\nfelix, the office seems to be eerily quiet and I find myself with\nnothing but my own company\nfor hours on end. People seem to\nappear only momentarily and then disappear as quick as they arrived. This is\nnot so much of a surprise on Monday\u2019s\nas, well, there\u2019s nothing really to do for\nthem as everyone is still waiting for the\nweeks content to arrive, but them not\nappearing on Tuesday or Wednesday\nafternoon, now that is a bit worrying.\nAs I quickly glance over to look at the\nissueplanIseethatweonlyhave12pag-es booked for this week. Not that bad\nas it means minimal work for me, but\nat the same time putting out 12 pages\nfeels like a disappointment. Eventually\nlife forms appear in the office, clearly\nstressed and in a hurry, I enquire as to\nwhat is happening to which I get one\nsimple reply. ELECTIONS!\nI had forgotten how much work\ngoes into the elections, making sure\nyour campaign material is OK\u2019d by the\nReturning Officer before you can do\nanything with it, having them tell you\nthat there is one minute problem with\nit, you having to change it only to be\ntold that there is another problem. It\nis stressful, I should know, I\u2019ve been\nthrough this whole thing about a year\nago.\nSeeing everyone work on their campaign material and fine tuning their\nmanifestos it made me think about\nwhat I promised the students of Imperial this time last year. Looking back,\nI must admit I could have done a lot\nworse. Setting up the light hearted\nmaterial again was very easy as people\nwere extremely willing to do it, and yes\nwe might have pushed it a little bit too\nfar with Hangman, but it is all about\nfinding a balance. FUCWIT is back\nand proving to be a great success, the\niPod\u2019s have clearly worked to entice\npeople to take part while Coffee Break\nis providing some interesting content.\n\u201cBring Page 3 back\u201d, centrepage, done!\n\u201cFree the Cat!\u201d well it\u2019s nearly out of the\nbag, I\u2019m pretty sure the stories on Magners and the Masquerade Ball prove\nthat. What else?\nAh, \u201cimprove the website\u201d, that was\ndefinitely not as easy as I thought and\nI must admit that thing just annoys\nme now. But it is OK dear readers, as\na new website, of sorts, is on its way.\nAs promised last year and after several months of research and talks, the\ndigital archive is underway [see page\n3] and it will be ready by November.\nSo I\u2019ve managed to stick to a lot of my\nmanifesto points and for those that I\nhaven\u2019t, I wholeheartedly apologise.\nI really don\u2019t envy the candidates this\nyear. The next two weeks are going to\nbe full of people offering you sweets\nand other bribes in order to get your\nvote. You never know, the decision you\nmake could actually make a difference,\nso when it\u2019s time to vote, please do!\nT\nhere have been leaked reports that reveal that the\nUK Government plans to\nban, in all but name, open\ncriticism of liberal Western values by Muslims.\nIn the beginning of February, Julia\nRobinson resigned as Head of Meersbrook Bank School (Sheffield) after\nparents objected to her insistence that\nMuslim children fully participate in\nChristian assemblies. It appears that\nMs Robinson wasn\u2019t on a personal crusade to force children of non-Christian\nfaith to sing Christian hymns; the Government is instead beginning the next\nphase in its anti-Muslim strategy \u2013\nforced assimilation of Muslims.\nBritain likes to pride itself on being\na pluralistic and secular society. Black\nand ethnic minorities make up nearly\n12% of the population across the UK,\nand over one in three Londoners belong to one of these minorities. Political parties parade their black and\nminority members of parliament, or\nindeed any aspiring MPs like prize cattle hoping to court the ethnic vote. The\nGovernment\u2019s hardline stance would\nthus seem to be at odds with Britain in\nthe 21st century.\nHowever there is a view, both among\nthe political right and left, that Muslims in Britain don\u2019t fit well with mul-ticulturalism. Minorities have, in the\npast, been integrated into British society with relative ease, adopting the\nsocial and cultural norms of the dominant population; interracial marriages\ndemonstrate the depth of integration.\nIn contrast, Muslims are not only\nvisibly different (women\u2019s dress, men\u2019s\nbreads) but their adherence to Islam,\nwhich defines their identity, is a serious obstacle to full integration. Thus,\nthe Government\u2019s view of Muslims\u2019\nadherence to Islamic values will be\nused against those who do not fall into\nbroad agreement with Western values.\nMuslims remaining silent or condoning the failures of secular liberal values\nand their incompatibility with Islam\nwill be tolerated, just. Those Muslims\nwho criticise, debunk, challenge or\ndare to condemn Western values will\nbe rooted out, isolated, marginalised\nand demonised, even though they do\nnot have a violent streak. This, together with Ms Robinson\u2019s stance of forced\nChristian assemblies for all children\n(Muslims mainly in this case) is nothing less than forced assimilation into\nthe culture of the dominant majority population, aimed at blurring and\neventually wiping out Islamic identity,\nvalues and thought.\nThis draconian emerging Government policy resembles how the British\nforcefully assimilated the Aborigines\nin newly colonised Australia. Sold as\nbeing \u2018for their own good\u2019, policies to\nassimilate Aborigines into British culture went to the extent of defining how\nthe natives brought up their children,\nand led to the forceful separation of\nAboriginal children from their parents.\nThese children became known as the\nstolen generation, and are still searching for their families.\nSome may argue that this representation is an over-exaggeration and scare-mongering. However, the stark reality\nis that since 9/11 we have seen significant anti-Muslim policy creep in, from\nanti-terrorism laws to preventing violent extremism.\nThis leaked new policy in fact exposes the failure of liberal democracies\nto defend their ideals from a viable alternative ideology that is widely gaining adherents from members of the\nindigenous population who have seen\nthe breakdown of Western values as\na way of life. Unable to win over supporters without offering funding and\njobs to a few ex-Islamist ideologues,\nthe Government is resorting to tyrannical tactics.\nAbdul\nHannan\nargues that\nMuslims\nare the\nvictims of a\ngovernment\nstrategy\nof forcible\nassimilation\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nWhere are all\nmy writers?\nKawai Wong and\nher head reunite\nM\ny head has been on\nholiday in the Andromeda NGC224\nsince 1986. This has\nrendered me one of\nthe most clueless of the century. A-level Maths and Physics taught me how to\nadd one to one. My bum has done my\ntravelling head a favour - it sat the ex-ams. That\u2019s how I am here at the fifth\nbest university in the world. When I\nbeckoned to the sky 2 years ago, seeing\nhow exams weren\u2019t 1+1 anymore, my\nhead agreed to travel back at the speed\nof light. But NGC224 is 2,520,000 light\nyears away.\nScientists are cool. Engineers are\ncool. Only smart people can be them.\nI ousted the monster and saved the\nprincess in the Final Level. Score, game\nover, now sit back and taste the victory\nfor the rest of my life. Good uni, good\ndegree. What could go wrong?\nMy interests have always been in the\n\u2018to be sorted\u2019 pigeonhole, next to \u2018priority\u2019\n. I catered my personal statement\nto the admission tutor\u2019s liking.

Fill the bracket with a desired noun.\nIt just never occurred to me that\nfinding a career is nothing like attending exams. Recalling facts from\nmy personal history and pasting the\nscattered memories onto an application form isn\u2019t exactly the best way to\ncombat the life-long career battle. This\nis the only weird occasion in life that\nlogical deduction is less sensible than\n\u201cfollow your heart\u201d.\nMy banker cousin smiled at me, revealing his gold teeth. \u201cI want some\ngold teeth\u2026\u201d, I responded cross-eyed.\nHe has recently been made redundant.\nThe spell on me has been broken. Do\nI really want some gold teeth? And\nmore importantly, do I want to sit at a\ndesk working on a spreadsheet while\na genie at the back of my head goes\n\u201cyouaresoboredyoushouldleaveanddosomethingelse\u201d? Do I then want to\nbang my head on the keyboard in the\nhope that the genie will go away and\nsubsequently get a bonus of \u201cI LOVE\nMY JOB\u201d engraved on my forehead?\nJack said finding a career doesn\u2019t\nreally matter; as long as you have a\n\u201cprofessional degree\u201d you can get in\nanywhere. Anywhere. I don\u2019t want to\ngo anywhere, Jack, I am after a specific\nsomewhere, Jack. Now, with my head\nnowhere to be seen and my feet stuck\nin a sea of DNA and T-cells, where do I\ngo from here? And who the hell is Jack?\nI don\u2019t know Jack!\nBefore my head and I parted in 1986,\nI wanted to be a writer. Then, I wanted\nto be a doctor. Then, I wanted to design an engine for BMW. If it was easy\nto score high marks in exams, surely it\nis easy to design an engine? Then, I was\nshafted by a screwdriver, in the derri-ere . Then, I wanted to combine science and literature, and biochemistry\nis quite wordy. Then, my cousin bit me\nwith his gold teeth. Now, I have made\nmy \u201cWelcome Home\u201d banner; my head\nis on its way now. Mate, where is your\nhead?\nI\nam very pleased to see the article in last week\u2019s Felix about the\nlegalisation of drugs because it\nis a subject that very few people are willing to openly discuss\nfor fear of intense criticism. Not only\ndid I agree with the sentiments but the\npoints were argued far more succinctly\nand scientifically than I have been able\nto myself.\nI have never understood how anyone\ncan condemn the users of cannabis\nin one breath, while taking a drag on\na cigarette with the next and helping\nthemselves to a bottle of red wine. Just\nbecause an activity is allowed by law\nand has been for a very long time does\nnot mean that it is somehow \u2018right\u2019. Last\ncentury homosexuality, the suffrage of\nwomen, abortion and blasphemy were\nconsidered the utmost in social degradation and \u2018sinful\u2019 and yet none of\nthese things would raise much more\nthan a few eyebrows these days.\nI am not advocating the use of currently illegal drugs and am not denying the potentially harmful effects that\noccur as a result of their use, but you\ncould say the same about skiing. As\nsomeone who has never skied I think\nit is an odd thing to want to do, especially seeing the injuries that people\ncan come back with, but I would never\ntry to ban someone from doing it. Anyone that knows me should know what\nI think of smokers, but it is their right\nto do what they want as long as it does\nnot harm others.\nPutting aside the hardest drugs, such\nas heroin and crack cocaine, for a mo-ment, drugs are naturally occurring or\nat least easily synthesised so how can\nyou stop it? And why should you?\nWe live in a free society, or at least\nwe think we do, and surely if someone\nwants to partake in an activity that\nharms no one except possibly themselves then who are we to stop them?\nAnd before everyone starts shouting;\nno, even hard drugs do not harm innocent bystanders any more than alcohol or smoking does. Drug addicts can\ncommit burglaries and robberies to\nfund their addiction, but only because\nthey have been forced into it by the\nfailure of society to deal with the prob-lem. Even the harmful effects of the\nharder drugs, such as acute addiction,\ncan easily be negated if help is freely\navailable and the stigma attached to it\nis reduced.\nDrug use, like prostitution, will not\nbe stopped by making it illegal, it is\nsimply driven underground where\nit creates far more problems than it\ncould possibly solve and creates a divided society; the higher class in their\nhigh-value homes in suburbia with not\na care in the world, and the lower class\ntrapped in slums where the police will\nnot tread. An exaggeration, maybe, but\ntry and deny that it isn\u2019t true.\nLegalise drugs: Tom Culley\n\n"

    "content": "East Meets West 2009\nSama Zaman and Kavita Aggarwal review this year\u2019s event at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, as well\nas giving a quick insight into the show\u2019s past\nA\nfter many months of preparation and much anticipation, the country (and\nImperial\u2019s!) largest and oldest student show, East Meets West, presented by\nIndian Soc, returned to the stage on Sunday 22nd February 2009 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. With an illustrious 17-year history, the show has established its own special place in the hearts of both performers and audience\nalike, and with expectations even higher after last year\u2019s stupendous success at the London\nPalladium, the pressure was certainly on. The evening began with a spectacular opening\nact, after which we were introduced to the event\u2019s celebrity host, legendary comedian Nina\nWadia, who brought with her a most delightful surprise in the form of fellow Goodness\nGracious Me actor Kulvinder Ghir, whose perfect comic timing and hilarious quips had\nthe audience in stitches for the entire show. The acts themselves were a joy to behold not\nonly due to their exceptional high quality performances, but also due to their variety, which\nis exactly what East Meets West represents and what makes the show so memorable and\nso unique. The spectacular array of talent seen included the renowned street dance form\nof Funkology, which was executed with so much passion that it looked almost effortless;\nscintillating traditional Russian ballet; an incredibly enthusiastic Light Opera performance\nand what many considered to be the highlight of the evening: bhangra by the Groundshaker\nteam. Overall the evening was extremely enjoyable and certainly delivered on its promise of\n\u2018the ultimate celebration of culture\u2019 whilst raising proceeds for and awareness towards three\nvery worthy causes: Save the Children, the Care Trust Education and this year\u2019s RAG charity the Winnicott Foundation. With yet another successful year to add to the show\u2019s legacy,\nwe look forward to seeing what East Meets West will offer next year!\nIn the beginning...\nStarting out in Imperial College\u2019s Great Hall, the inaugural show was a great success with a\nsell-out audience of 400 people. It began with the simple idea of merging classical eastern\nacts with more contemporary western performances, and has since grown into the incon-ceivable, ever widening and ever-diversifying production that it is today.\nPrevious venues have included the highly exalted Shaftesbury Theatre, Shepherd\u2019s\nBush Empire, Hammersmith Apollo, as well as the Barbican and many more prestigious\nlocations.\nAnd now...\nSet in the heart of London, the prestigious Theatre Royal, Drury Lane is the perfect setting\nfor this magical evening. The Theatre Royal is found in the West End of London. Officially\nsituated on Catherine Street, the theatre backs on to Drury Lane just to the east of Covent\nGarden. It was designed by Benjamin Wyatt and opened on October 10th, 1812 with a\nproduction of Hamlet. The interior has been redesigned and overhauled many times since\nthen and now boasts a seating capacity of 2,205. It is one of the West End\u2019s largest venues\nand is currently the home of the hit West End production of Oliver with Rowan Atkinson.\n24 felix Friday 6 March 2009\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nTechnology Editor \u2013 Richard Lai\nRichard Lai\nTechnology Editor\nA\npologies for my absence\nlast week - we spent more\ntime and effort than expected into our group\nproject presentation, but\nI think it paid off. At the same time, I\nalso had the opportunity to put Apple\u2019s\niWork \u201809 - specifically Keynote - to\npractical use instead of making price\ncomparison slides of new Apple prod-ucts, and the result was beautiful. Mac\nusers are strongly encouraged to try\nit - you can download the trial version\nfrom Apple\u2019s website.\nNow to the subject: by now most of\nyou gadget fans should have heard of\nor read about the Amazon Kindle 2\ne-book reader. It is no doubt a great\nimprovement from its predecessor:\nbetter button layout, slimmer design,\n25% longer battery life, faster display,\nnew dictionary, and the controversial\n\u201cRead-To-Me\u201d text-to-speech feature;\nbut I still have doubts about whether\nthe current range of e-ink devices will\nwin the hearts of traditionalists.\nYou see, the success of any new\npiece of gadget depends heavily on\nhow natural one feels with its interface\nand form factor. To some the problem\nwith the Kindle 2 and similar devices is\nthat the reading experience on them is\nstill very different to the real deal. Let\nus start off with their form factor: we\ntend not to read books in a tablet form,\nand I personally like to hold my novels with my one hand holding below\nthe V-shaped gutter. To satisfy me and\nlike-minded readers, the device would\nhave to utilise some sort of folding in\nthe middle.\nFine, the rest of you may argue that\nsome like to fold their books in half,\nbut what about the softness of the\nbook? That is another sensation which\nthe e-ink devices lack (the Kindle 2\nhas a cold metallic back!), and will no\ndoubt be a challenge for the developers to come up with a durable material\nthat gives the same feel as paper. This\nshould be possible, as demonstrated by\nthe current Wacom drawing tablets:\nback in the early days the tablets I used\nwere very slippery, not comfortable to\nuse after long periods; when I read that\nWacom\u2019s Bamboo tablet offers a \u201cpaper-like work area for a natural experience\u201d, I bought one straight away and it\nreally feels like writing on paper.\nNext we have the page-turning expe-rience: for me I get a greater satisfaction with flicking through pages of paper compared to using the scroll bar or\nscroll wheel. Understandably, since the\ne-book devices are not multi-paged it\nis hard for them to offer the same sen-sation. One possible solution is to implement a touchscreen and have a lag-less sliding animation like the one used\non the iPhone\u2019s photo viewer, but this\nwould restrict the device\u2019s form factor\nas I don\u2019t think this is possible on flexible materials yet, and let us not forget\nthat this would need greater graphics\npower too (thus money and battery).\nI\u2019m probably moaning too much, but\nI am very keen to see a device that will\ngive the right e-book experience. What\ndo you think? Drop me line on Twitter\nat http://twitter.com/richardlai .\nThoughts on\ne-ink devices\nLiving in the Cloud...\nRichard Lai compares some of the hottest cloud sync services\nY\nou may or may not have\nheard of cloud computing,\nbut the chances are you are\nalready using a few services offered by such technol-ogy. In a nutshell, cloud computing is\ncomputing using various online serv-ices, i.e. using the Internet (or metaphorically the \u201ccloud\u201d) instead of your\ndesktop PC as your computing plat-form. Think about Google Maps: users\ndo not have to install any extra apps on\ntheir computers in order to use it (that\nis assuming the computer already has a\ncompatible Internet browser), as all the\ndata is stored in the cloud.\nObviously, the fact that such services\nare on the Internet means that you can\naccess them from anywhere - specifically on any devices equipped with an\nInternet browser or relevant app. You\ndon\u2019t even have to worry about which\noperating system you are using, as most\nof these services are designed to be at\nleast accessible with all major browsers\nin the form of a website.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though: cloud\ncomputing is not just for mass-data\nservices like Google Maps, nor is it just\nfor enterprise services like Amazon\u2019s\nElastic Cloud Computing (EC2). Here\nare a few options for us majority users:\nGoogle has been one of the longest cloud service providers with their\nGoogle Apps platform, with Google\nDocs being their main cloud storage\nproduct. I\u2019ve personally used it to store\nmember records (as a spreadsheet) for\na student association outside Imperial College, but since I\u2019m not free to\nedit it all the time, I share the full editing access with another secretary and\nthe chairman - all they needed to do\nwas to sign up for a Google Account.\nGoogle Docs also has the essential online editing tools for word documents,\nspreadsheets and even PowerPoint\npresentations, saving us from having to\ndownload and upload files for even the\nsmallest changes.

But the service that I\nwant to highlight is Live Mesh: a sync\nservice between multiple computers\n(including Mac) and the cloud. This\ninvolves installing a client app on your\nmachines and then choosing which local folders you want to sync with the\ncloud. Likewise, you can also sync your\nmachines with the other folders already\non the cloud server.

This was matched if not\nsurpassed by the sheer heroics shown\nby Kent Zhang in finishing the 400 IM,\nwhich most certainly broke him for the\nrest of the competition. Special mention however must go to Claire Taylor\nfor reaching the final of the 50m freestyle in a time of 28.85 giving Imperial\ntheir only national finalist of the week-end. The weekend was rounded off\nnicely with good performances from\nboth medley relay teams finishing 27th\nand 31st. Fortunately IC swimming\ncoach Sergio Catania neither missed\nhis train nor fell between the train and\nplatform on this occasion, he did however resort to offering money to swimmers to compete in events, cheers for\nthe meal Sergio! Next weekend the\nteam head back up to Sheffield to swim\nin the national team event, hoping for\npromotion in to their premier league,\nwith a young and very promising squad\non their hands, it looks to be a successful visit for the team.\nIC swimmers go to Sheffield\nContinued from back page\nAt least there was some romance over the weekend\nAt the end of the winter term, the Imperial College Kendo Club had the very\ngreat pleasure and enormous privilege\nof hosting a training session like no\nother.\nChiba-sensei is a man you are lucky\nto meet in Japan, let alone outside of\nit. Three-times winner of the All Japan\nKendo Championship and previously\nthe chief instructor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Dojo, he is considered\nby many to be the strongest man in\nKendo.\nAttendance of the seminar lead by\nChiba-sensei was impressive: in addition to its own members, ICKC\nplayed host to members of the British National Squad and visitors from\nseveral other London dojos including\ntwo brothers of 9 and 11 who outshone\nall the other kendoka of two or three\ntimes their age.\nTwo hours of practice and commentary (ably translated by our own Emiko\nYosikawa) was followed by jigeiko\nwith Chiba-sensei, Matsumoto-sensei\n(British National Coach) and Salmonsensei (Chairman of the British Kendo\nAssociation).\nAll in all, the evening was a great\nsuccess, allowing us the opportunity\nsee live kendo of an exceptionally high\nstandard and to hopefully give a good\nimpression of British kendo.\nKendo club train with the\ngreat Chiba-sensei\nElizabeth Luthman\nChiba-sensei showing the Imperial College Kendo Club how the best in the world does it\nthe village to have our dinner, since\nthe local one didn\u2019t seem too keen on\nforeign folk like ourselves. At the pub\nwe ambitiously decided to ride the Bull\ntrail (all 20 km of it) the next day, before breakfast! This was the only way\nwe would have enough time left over to\nride the CliMachX trail before returning to London. After a couple of beers\nwe headed back for a more peaceful\nnight\u2019s sleep.\nOn Sunday my room was packed up\nand ready to go on time, only for us to\nfind that Henry, Roger and Doug were\nstill sound asleep. After some hasty\npacking we headed off on the Bull\n(Welsh: Tarw, I think) trail, which goes\nup the other side of the valley. I think\nwe were all surprised that we made it\nround at a reasonable speed without\nhaving much to eat beforehand. We\ngrabbed a cheeky sandwich and cheese\nat the top of the hill as we watched the\nsun coming up (fine, it was already up,\nbut you get the idea). At the end of the\ntrail we enjoyed some great rocky sin-gle-track descents. As we rolled back\ndown to the car park there was quite\na smug feeling watching the weekend\nwarriors coming up the other way,\nknowing that we had already ridden\nthe entire loop.\nAfter a well-deserved breakfast we\ndrove over to the CliMachX trail,\nwhich features the longest descent in\nWales. As you can imagine, this does\ninvolve going up a massive fireroad\nclimb before you can come down\nagain. There is some sick single-track\nwith some epic views at the top of the\nhill, which Dave T was enjoying a bit\ntoo much before he launched himself\nhead first into a stream going round a\nblind corner.\nA little shaken, but with no serious\ninjuries he got back in the saddle. In\nthe meantime Roger had zoomed off\nahead with mysterious new found energy (I guess he is a chemist after all).\nAt last we got to the final descent,\nwhich I can tell you is very long. The\nfirst section includes some nasty wet\noff-camber slabs and some sketchy\nshort climbs. In the middle section the\ntrail cuts across the side of the moun-tain, with a few jumps thrown in before\nit plunges back into the forest again for\nthe last, and best, part. You almost\nthink you\u2019re in the Alps when you see\nthe huge rocks and switchbacks, not\nto mention the cheeky North Shore\nberm. Once we had all made it down in\none piece, Roger kindly offered to take\nCoed-y-Brenin cycle trip\nus up in the van so we could ride the\nfinal descent again.\nIn the end, we beat the van on the\nway down by a couple of minutes. Dave\nM managed to get a pinch flat on the\nlast corner, bagging himself the \u2018First\nand Last Puncture of the Trip\u2019 award.\nWhile he was faffing about, Henry\nfound a nice slate wall which we ses-sioned until we had to go.\nOn the long way back Dave T\u2019s music\nchoices provided another round of ar-guing, and we had the now traditional\nBurger King dinner. In the end, a great\ntrip was had by all.\nContinued from back page\nThese boys clearly listened to us last time, as can be seen with the\nImperial student casually reading felix on the slate rocks\n1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8\n9 10\n11\n12 13 13 14\n14 15\n16 17\n18 19 20 21\n23 22 23\n24 32\n25 26 27\n34\n28 29\nAnswers to: sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCrossword No. 1,427\nAcross\n1 Writer stands before king\nwith unusually narrow cutting\nimplement.

However Iran is a market\nfor Russian weaponry, airliners, and civil nuclear technology. As such, it has\nstronger cards to play at the negotiations table, and could back the tougher\nsanctions on Iran demanded by the United States.\nUSA\nPresident Ra\u00fal Castro has marked his first year anniversary in power by\nhaving a major cabinet reshuffle.\nThe reshuffle has seen 10 officials step down, including two well-known\nloyalists of former President Fidel Castro. The transition of power from Fidel\nCastro, who ruled Cuba ever since the communist revolution in 1959, to his\nbrother Ra\u00fal has taken place quite smoothly.\nThe shake-up also included the merger of several ministries in order to\nmake the ageing communist bureaucracy more efficient. It comes at a time\nof improving US-Cuban ties, as well as better ties with Latin America, China\nand old cold war ally Russia too.\nCuba\nUN \u2013 The Hague\nRadovan Karadzic has refused to enter a plea at a pre-trial meeting of\nthe UN tribunal at The Hague (in the Netherlands) where he is accused\nof committing war crimes.\nMr Karadzic, a former political leader of Bosnian Serbs during the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s, was arrested in Serbia in July 2008 after spending\na decade in hiding disguised as a doctor of alternative medicine. The exact\ncharges made by prosecutors at the International Criminal Tribunal for the\nformer Yugoslavia (ICTY) include two counts of genocide and five counts of\ncrimes against humanity between 1992 and 1995.\nThe trial has been broadcast on\nTV in Bosnia, but judges have admitted that the proceedings have made\nvirtually no progress since last July.\nMany observers believe Karadzic is\nusing delaying tactics pioneered by\nformer Yugoslav President Slobodan\nMilosevic who was also on trial at the\nICTY, but died in 2006 before a verdict was delivered.\nImperial College accused of cheating in\nUniversity Challenge show\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nEarlier this week, the University Challenge team from Curpus Christi, Oxford, were disqualified for fielding an\nineligible member, after it was found\nout that Sam Kay had graduated in\nJune 2008 and was currently working for PricewaterhouseCoopers in\nReading.\nPast presenter Bamber Gascoigne\nhas lambasted the BBC telling the Radio 4\u2019s The World Show that \u201cTo fail to\nproduce a University Challenge based\non university life not within a single\nThe halls of residence is Evelyn Gardens have seen a rise in rent, all except Fisher Hall which remains\nunchanged\nuniversity year is pathetic.\u201d Current\npresenter Jeremy Paxman told the BBC\nthat \u201cI do feel sorry for the Corpus\nChristi team - but rules are rules, and\nthey had to be stuck to.\u201d\nIn a joint statement from the BBC\nand Granada, they said: \u201cThe University Challenge rules on student eligibility\nare that students taking part must be\nregistered at their university or college\nfor the duration of the recording of the\nseries.\u201d\nEver since this small \u201cfiasco\u201d, there\nhave been reports claiming that other\nuniversity teams had also fielded ineligible members in their team. Earlier\nthis week The Times had reported that\ntwo members from the Imperial College team that won in 2001 had already\ngraduated when the show was being\nfilmed.\nThere are no reports on what might\nhappen to the previous teams if they\nare found to have actually cheated, but\none thing that will need to be looked at\nare the rules. Since the show is filmed\nover the summer and effectively covering two academic years, it will mean\nthat third year students and below will\nbe the only ones eligible to participate,\nsomething which some students might\nfind particularly annoying.\nThe cost of renting Imperial College\naccommodation has had its annual re-view, with rents rising by 3.9% on aver-age. However, Fisher Hall has escaped\nthe rise.\nDeputy President (Education & Welfare), Hannah Theodorou, passed on\ndetails of the rent prices for Imperial\nAccommodation for the 2009-10 session earlier today, following a meeting\nwith the Committee on Student Residences. The rents are once again classified into different \u201cbands\u201d (A-F) and\nthen into different room types: a system set up by the committee in 2008.\nThe rent review means that next\nyear, the average price of renting Imperial College Accommodation will be\n\u00a3130.98. 27% of bed spaces will have a\nrent of less than \u00a3102.27 per week, 54%\nwill be less than \u00a3118.86 per week and\n7% of bed spaces will cost more than\n\u00a3177 per week.\nFisher Hall is the only hall in Central\nLondon to escape the rise in rent, with\nprices sticking at \u00a392.40 per week for\nthe cheapest single rooms and a very\nlow \u00a354.46 for a place in a triple room.\nThis is to \u201cprovide a lower cost hall\noffering\u201d. The report notes that refurbishment in Fisher Hall will be carried\nout in Summer 2009, as planned. Miss\nTheodorou told Live!, \u201cI am pleased\nwith the freeze in Fisher\u2019s rent, providing students with a low-cost accommodation option within walking distance\nof the campus. This will be happening\ndespite a refurbishment this summer\u201d.\nPostgraduate accommodation at\nClayponds is set to increase by around\n5.5% in order to reflect the refurbishment that has been carried out. Anyone living in areas which are still awaiting refurbishment will only be charged\nhalf of this increase (this affects 183 of\nthe 330 bed spaces). This leaves the average price rise in these halls at 3.9%.\nRents at Silwood will be increasing\nby 5.1%, with a standard single room\ncosting \u00a380.41 per week a twin room\ncharged at \u00a3133 per week between two\npeople, a couple or family flat being\ncharged at \u00a3172.88 per week and a bungalow now being charged at \u00a3204.25\nper week. Twenty-eight beds at William Penney will be frozen at this year\u2019s\nprices (\u00a372.52 per week), \u201cfollowing\nfeedback from students\u201d. The freeze in\nrent at William Penney leaves the average price rise at Silwood at 3.9%.\nIn all other halls, the aim has been\nto widen the price difference between\nmultiple and single occupancy rooms.\nThis means that rents multiple occupancy rooms are being increased by\n2.5% and single rooms and flats are being increased by 4.6%. Once again, this\ngives the average increase of 3.9%.\nThe report notes that The London\nSchool of Economics \u201cis proposing a\nbase increase of 5% with some halls\nincreasing by as much as 12%\u201d, which\nI presume is supposed to make us feel\nbetter about the increase.\nThis Live! reporter notices that the\nreport only compares the increase that\nLSE is putting forward, rather than\nhow the prices themselves compare to\nthose at Imperial College (they could\nhave been much lower before the in-crease). For example, LSE has beds in\ntwin rooms available at \u00a367 per week\nin Islington and \u00a375 per week near\nTottenham Court Road. Maybe this is\nsomething that the report can look at\nin 2010.\nThe report also comments upon private housing. It says that whilst there\nhas been a reduction in the average\nweekly rent for private housing across\nLondon, rent in the Kensington area\ndid increase during 2008. The report\nsays that \u201cin any case, it is still cheaper\nto stay in halls\u201d.\nThe report assumes that students\nwho live in private housing live in\nKensington, saying: \u201cAn average three\nbed house in South Kensington has a\nweekly rent of \u00a3800 p/wk or \u00a3266 per\nroom. This excludes shared expenses\nsuch as utilities that add a further \u00a326\np/wk. A private housing alternative is\ntherefore approximately \u00a3292 p/wk for\na room compared to \u00a3176.47 for a band\nE single ensuite in Southside.\u201d\nImperial to increase rent in\nhalls of residence\n15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington\nLondon SW7 3ES\n(1 Minute walk from\nSouth Kensington Tube)\nCASH ONLY\n\u2018Still the best student\noffer in South\nKensington!\u2019\nONLY BY EXPERIENCED STYLISTS\n\u00a326* .....

To me it seems this \u2018coincidence\u2019 seems attributable to three\nfactors really impeding the embracing\nof \u2018green\u2019 issues in the wider popula-tion. It is likely there can be a feeling\nof it being to heavily shoved down\nour throats on a daily basis I\u2019m sure.\nBut there must also be some feeling\nthat it\u2019s not yet affecting mankind and\nmay not do so in our lifetime. Finally\neven at Imperial that feel they don\u2019t\nknow if the science is right or that the\nimmediate economic benefits of not\nbeing sustainable outweighs the long-term costs. Perhaps Greenpeace has\njust been getting on everyone\u2019s nerves\nsince the seventies.\nAs much as I\u2019d like to avoid engaging these three in too much detail, it\nstands to note that the World Health\nOrganisation estimates 150,000 deaths\nin 2000 may be attributable to anthropogenic climate change. This figure\nand the projections of increase is an\nequivalent number of deaths to fifty\n9/11\u2019s every year.\nIs being an environmentalist a bad\nword? I\u2019m going to be bold. If you care\nabout animals and extinction, you\u2019re\nan environmentalist. If you care about\npeople in developing countries, you\u2019re\nan environmentalist. If you care about\nthe long-term future of the economy,\nyou\u2019re an environmentalist. OK, you\nmay not be attending rallies, and are\nperhaps more conscious of being labelled a hippy than the more vocal of\nus, but the interests are fairly common\nand rudimentary. To me it seems bizarre to try to dispute the science, especially understanding the framework\nof scientific research, and the level to\nwhich expertise is reached in the postgraduate world. If they had the time,\nI would say why not have a chat with\nthe Professors in the Department of\nAtmospheric Physics? Sure you\u2019d be\ntold that the models aren\u2019t perfected,\nbut when are they? In fact, it has been\nsuggested that the IPCC (Intergovern-mental Panel for Climate change) are\ntoo conservative in its estimates due\nto the intense scrutiny it receives from\ninterest groups and sceptics.\nAt times the expertise gap between\nthe most polar sides of the debate\nseems comparable to the one that can\nbe seen with evolution\u2019s critics. That\u2019s\nnot to say any criticism of details of the\nresearch is invalid, but rather than go\ndown that long and winding road, why\ndon\u2019t I use this opportunity to emphasise some of the smaller and simpler\nthings that can make prove a significant and helpful step when done properly and en masse.\nAluminium is arguably the most important thing to recycle due to the energy used in production, tins and cans\nare probably the ones to remember the\nmost. Remember not all plastics can be\nrecycled. At the moment in the College\nrecycling scheme it\u2019s plastic bottles, or\nanything that has a number 1, 2, or 3 in\nthat little triangle of arrows that graces\neach plastic item. If there\u2019s too many\n\u2018contaminants\u2019 (over 10%) in the recycling (and this includes the wrong ma-terials, but especially things like lumps\nof food) then the whole wheelie bin is\ngoing to be sent to landfill. Having said\nall that, reports from the new recycling\nscheme have been positive.\nThe planet naturally does a lot to\nneutralise and sequester our effect, but\nat the end of the day it is a question of\nscale, and the sheer volume of greenhouse gases leaked by our civilisation\nis simply greater than can controlled\nby our ecosystems. There is an army\nof people thinking about what can be\ndone about this, but the problem requires an even bigger army actually\ndoing so.\nRegardless of personal feelings about\nthe best approach to protect the environment and the economy, there is a\nsimple common sense reason for reducing consumption of resources, especially fossil fuels. To quote the Institute of Mechanical Engineers\u2019 journal\nProfessional Engineering \u201cIt is the simple fact that it took rather a lot more\nyears to make the stuff than it seems\nlikely to take to consume a good proportion of what\u2019s there\u201d.\nRemember not all plastics can be\nrecycled in the College\u2019s scheme\nIs the environment reason enough to go veggie?\nWould you eat a puppy? If you told me\nit was reared in a carbon neutral fashion I certainly would.\nThere are many reasons to be a veg-etarian, for some it\u2019s because of the\ntreatment of animals in most large-scale farming practises are not the nicest for the animal, a lot of the meat sold\nin the supermarket for next to nothing\nprobably lived in appalling conditions.\nOther people are vegetarian for religious or cultural reasons. Another argument I know about is the one I think\nhas the most weight and persuasive\nability behind it. At the moment the\nnews is mainly focussing on the economic climate which I have gleaned\nisn\u2019t the best. It has also been said that\nthe recession is going to push \u2018Climate\nChange\u2019 onto the back Russian-piped\ngas burner, and that is probably true\nbecause who cares about the ice-caps\nwhen you are redundant with a mortgage payment due last Wednesday.\nI still care about the ice caps melting\nwhen you\u2019re redundant with a mortgage payment due, I\u2019m afraid, and\nthere has never been a better time\nto set large scale changes in motion.\nHowever, there is also something that\neach of us omnivores can do, and that\nis to start embracing the herbs, and by\nembracing I mean cutting and cooking\ninto something delicious.\nFirstly, cows and sheep fart a lot.\nRainforests burp every now and then I\nknow, but they can be forgiven because\nthey are a huge carbon sink. Cows\non the other hand fart out methane\n(around a third more potent as a Green\nHouse gas than CO2) in incredible\nquantities (500L a day). In total these\nanimals produce more greenhouse\nemissions than the world\u2019s transport\nsystems. Additionally livestock animals\nproduce nitrous oxide and ammonia on\na gargantuan scale, not forgetting CO2,\nthus contributing greatly to the green\nReuben Gibbins\nVegSoc\nhouse effect and acid rain. The animals\nreared also poop, and this has annoying complications of contributing to algal blooms in the water systems, which\nin turn can lead to dead zones.\nThen there are the resources required\nto produce the meat; which is hor-rifically inefficient. There is the classic example that a kilo of beef requires\nat least 13,000 L of water (dependent\non location and breed) while a kilo of\nwheat requires a mere 2000L. This is\nof course a simple example because I\ndon\u2019t want to limit my diet to things\nmade of wheat and I am aware water\ndemands of other plants, such as rock-et, are much greater, however it doesn\u2019t\neven approach the requirements of\nthat kilo of beef. The crisis relating to\nwater is so great it not only has an international day (March 22nd) we are\ncurrently in a decade of action \u2013 Water\nFor Life \u2013 because a sixth of the world\u2019s\npopulation do not have access to clean\nwater. Of course, you could point out\nthat the glaciers are melting and more\ninteresting weather patterns will balance out this water loss, however rain\nnot falling on the right catchment area\nis effectively useless and most water\nwill end up salinated. Desalination isn\u2019t\nyet as cost effective as better water use\npractises and proper conservation.\nCurrently 70% of agricultural land\nis used for farming animals, either\nthrough grazing pastures or for the\ncrops to feed the beasts. To meet demand agricultural land is sourced from\nwhat would otherwise be unused, resulting in considerable deforestation\nacross the globe. In terms of energy,\nbeing vegetarian is a much more efficient way of living as you remove the\nfood chain process, requiring less land\nand water to support you. Furthermore\nfeed has to be transported to the farms,\nas well as the produce transported away\nand packaged, although these factors\nand industrial processes are smaller in\ncomparison to the produce from the\nanimals themselves they still add up to\nthe environmental hoof-print that we\nhave created; the post-consumer \u2018food\nmile\u2019 is less than half that of produce\ntransport emissions.\nIt is not only the legged animals we\nshould stop eating: pescetarianism is a\nstep in the right direction but it doesn\u2019t\ntake into account that fish stocks are in\nafairlybadplace.Althoughbetteraqua-culture techniques are sure to arise, at\nthe moment two thirds of the world\u2019s\nfish species are either fully exploited\nor depleted. The removal of key species also messes with the ecosystems\nin place, which do not help when you\nremove prey for the sharks and whale\nand then go hunting them for scientific\npurposes; I\u2019m looking to you Scandinavia and Japan. Overfishing can lead to\nsituations where remaining stocks are\nunable to restock the oceans properly\nand the process of by-catch where the\nmajority of what is caught is discarded\nas waste is highly inefficient.\nMany of these arguments are applicable only when applied to a global\nscale, and yet the change to vegetarianism is essentially a solo switch. Even if\nthe whole of the UK switched to vegetarianism and adopted greener life\nstyles, the rest of the world will still be\ngetting their steak knives out. In the\nsame way that everyone wants a car, as\nnations become more wealthy they will\ndesire similar diets that are indicative\nof opulence. If large enough numbers\nof people start to do something eventually the numbers will reach a critical\nmass and everyone will adopt the ac-tion, thus should enough of us change\nour lifestyles people, like the cattle\nwe\u2019re refraining from eating will follow\nsuit, or see that you don\u2019t have to begin to consume animals. This ties into\nhow meat is fairly expensive, which is\nnot surprising when taking into consideration the higher requirements of\nwater and feed compared to vegetable\nproducts.\nI\u2019m well aware most of my arguments are not reasons to turn vegetar-ian, rather reasons to not eat meat, but\nif you smoke you look cool but also\nmake your lungs upset, and dumping\ntoxic waste into river sources is good\nbecause it\u2019s not your problem anymore\nleads to all manner of cleaning up being required down the line. Meat is an\nunavoidable part of our society.\nIn a perfect world there shouldn\u2019t be\narguments for turning vegetarian, rather highlighting it as a choice that some\npeople believe is healthier and kinder\nto our animal kin. Ideally a sustainable\nfarming situation will arise allowing\npeople to eat anything may want, however with the ever increasing global\npopulation that is unlikely to arise no\nmatter what wide spread changes oc-cur. I appreciate that radically altering\nyour diet may seem at first a large and\ndaunting task to undertake; you could\ntry going vegetarian for a month, but\nthere would not be any tangible prize\nat the end other than self satisfaction\nof completing the challenge or the\ngreat first bite back into meat. However, by making small gradual changes\none would make gradual reductions\nin one\u2019s impact on the environment.\nI don\u2019t know of many people who eat\nmeat every day, and it is not a tall order\nto further reduce this to limiting yourself to meat only once a week or once\na month. This would dramatically reduce your carbon footprint as well beginning to illustrate that a vegetarian\nlifestyle is feasible. Furthermore, if you\nbegin a habit of pseudo-vegetarianism\nyou are more likely to expand on it to\nthe point where you eat less meat.\nPersonally, if I said I was going vegetarian for life it would be a lie, likewise I know I will travel in a plane, even\nif I would prefer to travel overland (I\ndon\u2019t do seas too well), and I will at\nsome point probably buy a car, although hopefully by that time I hope it\nwill be technologically better and environmentally less damaging than those\naround today, but I reckon I could be in\nthe position where I only eat meat on\nspecial occasions. And even then, it\u2019ll\nprobably only be roadkill on Christmas\nDay. Yum.\nCows are good at farting. In fact they manage to fart out 500L of\nmethane a day, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2.\nEmail Hannah on dpew@imperial.ac.uk\nEmail Nigel on advice@imperial.ac.uk\nWelfare\nWelfare Editor \u2013 Hannah Theodorou\n15\nFriday 6 March 2009 felix\n\n"

It looks at Picasso\u2019s\nlife and work from a different perspec-tive. He is known for being an artistic\nradical and an innovator, but here we\nsee Picasso\u2019s devotion to and imitation\nof the artists he adored \u2013 figures he\nidolised but who are now often second\nto him in fame \u2013 Raphael, Goya, Ingres,\nCezanne, Manet, Delacroix, Velazquez\nand others. The exhibition is also organised a little differently to the norm.\nInstead of the standard chronology the\npaintings are arranged by subject mat-ter, ranging from self portrait to female\nnude to still life. This is one of the best\nthingsabouttheexhibitionbecauseyou\ncan marvel at the full range of his skills\nand styles. After all, Picasso wasn\u2019t just\na Cubist. His style can be clean and\nsimple or frenzied, muted or colourful,\nabstract or near-photographic. All are\nrepresented here.\nThe exhibition isn\u2019t as big as I ex-pected; only six rooms, with a different subject matter in each. This makes\nit manageable and accessible to arty\nnewbies. It\u2019s also well annotated by\nhelpful labels next to each painting,\nwhich always goes down well with\nme. This makes the audioguide, which\nthe majority of visitors fork out \u00a33 for,\nunnecessary. One of the few things I\ndisliked on my visit was the constant,\near-splitting \u201cEEEEEEEEEEEEE\u201d given\nout by the audioguides around me as\nthey changed tracks. I\u2019d actually recommend getting yourself an audiogu-ide just to block out the sound of other\npeople\u2019s. At one point it hurt so much I\nhad to sit down and cover my ears just\nto numb the headache. It doesn\u2019t really\nmake you want to linger and savour the\nart.\nThe art is varied and holds your\ninterest throughout. The exhibition\nstarts with self-portraits, which were\nlight-hearted and enjoyable. It always\ninterests me to see how artists portray\nthemselves. \u201cThe Artist in front of his\nCanvas\u201d and \u201cSelf-Portrait with a Wig\u201d\nare fine examples of the quirky fun to\ncome. You start to see the playful side\nof Picasso. I was less keen on the room\nof \u201ccharacters and types\u201d, which was\nprobably the lowlight. I found the dark\nportraits cavaliers and historical style\nfigures like \u201cPortrait de Jaime Sabartes\nen Grand Espagne\u201d all a bit too sinister,\nbut I dare say this is down to personal\ntaste and others will find this room the\nhighlight.\nI was struck by Picasso\u2019s different relationships with women. In the room\nof \u201cmodels and muses: nudes\u201d Picasso\ncomes off as a bit of a playboy, or possibly just a dirty old man. Some of the\nannotations and commentary here\nis amusing, with titbits such as \u201cfrom\nhis earliest years Picasso painted female nudes, often as women at their\ntoilette or enjoying the privacy of the\nboudoir\u2026 these are women abandoned\nto the sensuality of their bodies, a subject Picasso never tired of exploring\u201d.\nNo, I bet he didn\u2019t. There was also a\ncomment at some stage about how he\nwould frequent brothels for research\npurposes. But this contrasts with a\nroom of \u201cmodels and muses: the pensive sitter\u201d, which is full of respectful\nportraits of elegant, intelligent women.\nI looked at them, in particular the stunning \u201cPortrait of Olga\u201d and longed for\nPicasso to paint my portrait and make\nme look so regal and knowing.\nI\u2019m a big fan of Picasso\u2019s still lifes.\n\u201cSkull, Sea Urchins and Lamp on a Table\u201d is so quintessentially Picasso and\nyet something that wouldn\u2019t look out\nof place on your wall at home. I love\nhow he echoes Cezanne in so many\nof these paintings \u2013 you can see it in\nthe apples. Skulls are always a popular\nsubject in still lifes, and Picasso shows\noff his limitless talent in \u201cRam\u2019s Skull\u201d,\nwhich is raw and bold but still with\nincredible depth and realism. They\u2019ve\nbeen left to the end but make sure you\ntake a few minutes to give them the attention they deserve.\nThe stars of the show are his \u201cvariations\u201d. Picasso loved to produce variations of iconic masterpieces, taking\nclassic images and scenes and offering his personal twist. I hadn\u2019t known\nabout this passion of his until I saw\nthis exhibition, and it\u2019s unmissable.\nHe takes \u201cWomen of Algiers\u201d by Delacroix, awe-inspiring in its own right,\nand turns them into something almost\nunrecognisably vivid and exciting and\nfilled with garish colour. It\u2019s totally\ndifferent but somehow in the spirit of\nthe original. He does the same several\ntimes over with Manet\u2019s \u201cLuncheon on\nthe Grass\u201d, desperate to do it justice and\nalso add more, streaking blue and grey\nand adding his own classic form to the\nnudes. You should be utterly wowed by\nhis take on Velazquez\u2019s \u201cLas Meninas\u201d,\nwhich takes pride of place in the exhi-bition. At first you can\u2019t even tell what\nthe painting\u2019s of, and it takes a second\nglance for it to hit you. This, like most\nof the variations, need to be viewed\nfrom afar first to place the figures and\nobjects in the frame. My personal favourite variation is tucked in a corner\nsubtly \u2013 \u201cThe Rape of the Sabines\u201d. It\u2019s\nin cheery brights and pastels but depicts a haunting scene of rape and destruction that grabs the soul. It\u2019s like a\nscaled down, doodled \u201cGuernica\u201d. Look\nat the female forms, screaming faces\nand babies that looked like stuffed toys.\nMy one niggling criticism is that these\npaintings would be infinitely better if\nhung next to their originals or, more\nrealistically, even bigger reproductions\nto at least allow comparison.\nMy only criticisms are the whole\naudioguide-based agony, my usual\nwhinge about the price of tickets\n(though being a student gets you a substantial discount) and the fact that the\nexhibition space in the Sainsbury wing\nof The National Gallery is a bit like a\nS\no many times individuals\nhave asked themselves the\nquestion: \u201cwho am I?\u201d\u2026 The\nvisual artist Roni Horn has\nmade it her vocation of trying to explore all different themes of\nidentity, seeing it as mutable and multiple rather than fixed.\nBorn in New York in 1955, she is one\nof these artists who became automatically jaded of classical representations\nof art and accepted Minimalism as a\nbasis for creativity. Throughout her\nlife, she investigates what creates identity and how it can be manipulated,\nchanged. This can be reflected in her\nart by the various medias she uses to\nexpress herself; drawings, sculpture,\nphotography, video, etc... Central to\nher theme of identity is also the idea of\nplace, or how place defines identity by\nthe process of \u201cbecoming\u201d.\nIn that sense, she mostly tries to relate to identity through the different\nrelations that create it; the place where\none is will define one\u2019s identity, which\ncan be altered in another setting. Her\nperception of art\u2019s purpose is also\nbased on that principle. For example,\nwhat a piece means, or what it is, for\nthe viewer will depend on where he is\nfrom, what he has experienced in his\nlife, etc. This mixture of existential concepts translates into arts through various means. One of Horn\u2019s realizations\nis the use of identical pieces, paintings\nor sculpture, displayed in three rooms\nin a different order each time. While\nthe objects are the same in each room,\nthe experience of the viewer is different every time as it is seen through\nthe memory of the previous works. In\nfact, Horn believes that what is familiar\nbecomes unfamiliar just by the fact of\nbecoming familiar\u2026 Hum\u2026. What? In\nshort, Horn asserts that it is the experience of the audience that creates the\nart, and not the art itself. The latter is\nin itself a statement that can be much\ndiscussed, being relentlessly linked in a\nloop of circular reasoning to the question of identity and purpose of art, or\nof the self if the self depends on art.\nTherefore what is the self, and what is\nart?\nIf you think you have a headache,\nwait until you reach her theme exploring the identity of water, it is overwhelming like a tsunami\u2026 In fact, the\ncollection of Still Water (The River\nThames for Example) is build on a series of close-up photographs of different currents and colors of the Thames,\nprovided with the personal analysis of\nthe author in the form of footnotes to\n\u201cyou\u201d. Once again, the interaction between the piece and the viewer will\ndefine his experience and therefore\nthe piece itself. With statements such\nas \u201cIs water sexy? Black water is not\nsexy\u201d, the audience is left to ponder if it\nmakes any sense at all.\nOn the other side, why ask so many\nquestions on art, why not solely enjoy\nit? However, Horn\u2019s work can be found\nto stand within a profound vacuum if\nnot related to the questions they explore as in themselves they possess\ncave. If you\u2019re thinking about going,\nyou might want to book your tickets\nbecause the exhibition is bringing in\nthe crowds \u2013 I went on the first Saturday after it opened and you could\nhardly move in there. That or go at a\nfunny time on a weekday. This exhibition is beautifully presented and some\nof the paintings are unmissable. Don\u2019t\ngo expecting to see all his usuals; this is\nan excellent chance to see what Picasso\nand his art were really like.\nRoni Horn shows us who she is\nvery limited technical qualities. Most\nphotographs are not bad, but do not\nhave any character in themselves if\nseparated from their existential \u201cmeaning\u201d. In that sense, Horn really succeeds\nin creating a discussion on identity for\nall viewers, as for almost every piece\nEmile Beuchamp discovers the \u2018special\u2019\nworld of Roni Horn and her different\nways of expressing herself\nit is inevitable to ask oneself what exactly it that thing in front of you. For\nthose ready to reach deep in their inner self and submit to an introspection\non what is it, where is it and why is it\nthere, Roni Horn aka Roni Horn is a\nhighly concentrated dose of these con-temporary, abstractly conceptual exhibitions that so well reflect how society\nif lost today. Fit in an appointment in\nadvance with your shrink if you already\nhave one. For those less thrilled, may I\nsuggest Rodchenko and Popova\u2019s exhibition right across the corridor?\nRoni Horn\u2019s installation view at Whitney\nLes femmes d\u2019Alger, 1955 owned by a European Private Collection\nLe D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019Herbe, after Manet, 1961 which is at the Museu Picasso de Barcelona\nThe Artist in front of his Canvas, 1938\n\u00a9 RMN / G\u00e9rard Blot / Succession Picasso /DACS 2009\n\u00a9 RMN / Jean-Gilles Berizzi / Succession Picasso / DACS 2009\n\u00a9 Photo courtesy of Libby Howie / Succession Picasso / DACS 2009\n\n"
