    "content": "Revi\nFILM\u2014\nOrphans\n(Cert 15)\nThere's an old, decaying house in\nNewark in which two orphaned\nbrothers hold the world at bay, both\nemotionally and physically. The\nelder, Treat, goes out every day into\nthe civilised world to steal from\nanyone he can, 'earning a living'.\nPhillip, the younger brother, must\nstay indoors all the time\u2014if he\nbreathes in the outdoors air he'll die\nfrom a violent allergic reaction\u2014or so.\nTreat tells him. Then, one night,;\nTreat brings home a drunken business;\nman, who's carrying around millions\nof dollars in stocks in his briefcase.\nTreat figures that they have kidnapped\nthe businessman, and can hold him\nfor ransom. He goes out the next day\nto make his demands of the\nbusinessman's friends\u2014but when he\ncomes back, frustrated because none\nof these 'friends' seem to care about\nthe businessman, Harold, he finds that the man has escaped from his\nbindings\u2014and wants to employ him\nand his brother.\nOrphans is based on the stage play\nby Lyle Kessler, who also wrote the\nscreenplay for the film. The film\ndoesn't suffer at all from being\n'opened up'. The scenes of Treat\nmugging and thieving and meeting\nHarold all fit perfectly within the\nframework of the intense action that\ntakes place within the house.\nTreat, superbly played by Matthew\nModine (from Stanley Kubrick's Full\nMetal Jacket) sees himself as charged\nwith his younger brother's safety. He\ninterprets anything that he has no\ncontrol over as a threat to that safety,\nand consequently ends up cruelly\nhounding Phillip about starting to read\nsome books. For most of the film\nTreat is the tough character, and\nPhillip the gentle soul. But Harold\nmanages to 'tame' Phillip whilst Treat\nis out of the house by offering to give\nthe young man some 'encouragement'\nby putting his arm around his\nshoulders. The gentle touch of\nanother human being wins Phillip\nover. Treat, on his return, however,\nonly understands force. Fortunately,\nHarold understands force as much as\nhe understands humanity.\nThe mid-section of the film is about\nthe growing relationship between\nHarold and the two boys. He becomes\nfather to Phillip\u2014but still there is\nsomething wild in Treat\u2014'I'm not\nyour son!' he screams. One day Treat\ncomes home, wearing yet another\nnew suit and a ring. Pressed by\nHarold, he explains that on the way\nhome a fat man dropped his cigarette\nby his foot and then accidently trod\non his toe, thinking that he was\nscuffing out his fag. Incensed, Treat\ngot the man in an alley and robbed\nhim of his ring. Harold sadly realises\nthat Treat is still nowhere near ready\nfor 'the assignment' which he wants\nthe young man to do.\nLater on Treat comes home and\nproudly tells how he made a black\nman stop taking up too much room\non a bus by threatening to shoot him.\nHarold tries to make Treat understand\nwhat the consequences of such an\naction would be. With Phillip as the\nblack man they re-enact the scene.\nTreat's emotions are too strong for\nhim to control\u2014he's too much a wild\nanimal, unused to any kind of self-restraint. He passes out. Harold is\nsad\u2014but congratulates Treat on at\nleast trying.\nBy now we are very familiar with\nthe fact that Harold is a gangster, and\nthat all he is doing is using the house\nas a safe refuge from the underworld.\nBut since his attempts at taming the\nferal Treat have failed, he realises that\nhe's going to have to go on 'the\nassignment' himself. Before leaving\nhe gives Phillip a map so that he'll\nalways know where he is. Phillip\nventures out into the world, free\u2014he\nsuffers no kind of allergic reaction at\nall.\nOrphans is the best film to come\nout in years; it abounds with fresh\nideas and beautiful imagery, such as\nthe scene where Harold opens\nPhillip's bedroom window, and the\nyoung man breathes in the night air\nfor the first time ever, leaning out into\nthe fresh pouring rain, washing away\nhis troubles. When Harold escapes\nfrom his bounds, watched by Phillip,\nwho has been told by Treat not to\ntouch Harold, it seems to the young\nman that Harold is using magic. One\nsquirm and the man's right hand is\nfree\u2014another and he is up and\nwalking. Harold goes through the film\nseeming much like a con jour er, quietly manipulating the boys,\nespecially Treat. Phillip is turned\nagainst Treat by Harold's attentions.\nTreat one day brings home a giant jar\nof mayonnaise, which Phillip used to\nlove, but Phillip's tastes have\nchanged\u2014he likes what Harold likes.\nThe ending of the film is an\nemotionally tortuous experience-Treat and Phillip finally have to come\nto terms with Harold leaving them.\nTreat's layer of toughness finally is\nshattered, to reveal an emotional\nwreck, hiding from the world, unable\nto change, unable to try and learn and\ngrow. Phillip is by far the stronger of\nthe two, and cradles his brother's head comfortingly.\nIt's hard to say what makes\nOrphans so gripping, why it elicits\nsuch a strong response. It may be\nbecause it's about connecting with\nothers, about finding love under the\noddest of circumstances; it manages\nto evoke a yearning for something\nundefinable, yet long gone\u2014a basic\nlonging.\nThis film isn't to be missed\u2014it's funny, fascinating, touching and\nleaves you feeling emotionally wrung\nout. It opens on Friday March 11 at\nthe Cannon Haymarket and Cannon\nChelsea, but is well worth the wait.\nMake a note in the Organiser!\nChina Girl\n(Cert 18)\nChina Girl is the story of love in a racist so city. It's more or less a reworking of Romeo and Juliet\u2014\nChinese girl Tyan-Hwa moves into\nChinatown in New York's East Side,\nand meets Tony Monte, a kid from\nLittle Italy. The two districts are\nseparated only by Canal Street, and\nLittle Italy is slowly being\noverwhelmed by the fast growing\nChinatown. However, the\nrelationship between the two areas has\nbeen, on the whole, good. But whilst\nTyan-Hwa and Tony try to see each\nother without being seen by her\nvicious older brother, a violent gang\nwar breaks out between the youths of\nthe Triad and Mafia. In a display of\nbloody power and retribution, the\nelders of the crime syndicates put an\nend to the violence.\nThe film is directed by Abel\nFerrara, whose previous work\nincludes some fairly off-beat films,\nand a couple of episodes of Miami\nVice. This association with the glossy\nviolence of new-wave American\ncrime programmes has obviously had\nan effect on Ferrara; he seems slightly\nill at ease with the growing\nrelationship between Tyan-Hwa and\nTony, which is supposed to be the\ncentral element of the film. Instead,\nhe demonstrates that his true forte is\nvisual violence. China Girl has some\ntruly exciting chases in it\u2014nothing\nactually happens, but the fast images;\nand pounding rock music catch you\nup and carry you along until their\nconclusion. Ferrara handles the\nviolent back street gang battles,\ncallous Mafia beatings and brutal\nTriad executions with ease and\naplomb.\nUnfortunately the film boils down\nto a collection of borrowed scenes and;\nideas; the gang warfare from The\nGodfather, culture clash from West\nSide Story and Mixed Blood. In one\nscene, the two young lovers ask how\nto say T love you' in the other's language\u2014directly from West Side\nStory. The film is also badly let down\nby the two teen-pic leads; they are just\ntoo bland to care about, and you find\nyourself drawn more to the sub-plots\nthan to what is ostensibly the main\nstoryline\u2014their love.\nChina Girl is a return to true neo\nnoir style, with some striking visuals,\nsuch as a fleeing Chinese youth\ndisrupting a Mean Streets-style\nreligious procession and knocking\nover a statue of the Virgin Mary,\nwhich shatters, leaving the plaster\nhead spinning on the road surface.\nThe film tries to be intelligent, but the\ntwo leading players lose out to the\nexcellence of the supporting cast and\nto the professionalism of the violence.\nJames Hong is particularly good as a peacemaking Triad leader, safe in the\nknowledge that Chinatown is\nengulfing the Italians. ('In five years'\ntime you'll have to go to Brooklyn to\nget pizza'.)\nWith its loud rock music, vivid\ndancing and teen-movie knife fights,\nChina Girl is the first of Ferrara's films to rate a big UK release\u2014it's not\nas intense as some of his earlier work,\nand consequently not really worth\ngoing to see. But the next few films\nfrom Ferrara stand a good chance of\nbeing successful, if he's given decent\nscripts and budgets.\n10 Friday January 29th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Welcome to the first of a series of\n'special' issues which will be running\nover the next few weeks. This is our\nStudent Travel issue. It is a little on\nthe small size due to lack of finances\nin the FELIX coffers but it contains\na personal account of a trip around the\nworld, youth hostelling and\ninter railing. We are planning a special 'Comic\nRelief issue next week to coincide\nwith Comic Relief Day. All your\nspecial College officials will be\ndonning their red noses and the whole\nissue will be incredibly tongue-in-cheek. This means that we will only\ninclude articles and reports which fit\nin with the general 'feel' of the issue.\nYou have been warned.\nI must apologise for the lack of a SciTech page in this issue, but Steve\nBlack has been ill for the past week.\nHe has promised me that the page will\nreturn as soon as he is well again.\nCouncil horror\nI left Monday's Council completely\ndisillusioned with the Union a nfl the\nrunning thereof. I could not believe\nthat Ian Howgate's report, which\ncontained proposals for the biggest\nUnion shake-up in years, was passed.\nHis proposals for the three Union\nsabbaticals were ill-conceived and\nmisguided. He has effectively created\na new sabbatical post and thrown one\naway in just one Council. Why does\nit only require one Council meeting\n(only members can vote) to\ncompletely change the way a Union\nis run and a Union General Meeting\n(any Union member can vote) to\nadopt Bungle, Zippy and George as\nmascots?\nI think what concerned me most\nwas that the meeting was so badly\nhandled by the Chairman Alistair\nSeymour. With such a major subject\nto discuss, he should have first\nallowed debate on whether we needed\nsuch a drastic reorganisation of the\nUnion. Instead he allowed petty\nsquabbles over wording of job\ndescriptions. Had Mr Howgate\nconsulted with other Unions which\nhad tried creating a sabbatical to run\nentertainments, he would have\ndiscovered that all have failed.\nAberystwyth is a case in point. They\nfound that the only people who stood\nfor the post were those concerned\nwith self-promotion and freebie-hunting. Their entertainments were\nworse than before the change. In the\nend they appointed a permanent\nmember of staff as Entertainments\nOfficer with the brief that his wages\nwould be paid for out of the profits,\nand if there were no profits, then he\nwouldn't get paid! However, we have\nnow been landed with a sabbatical\nposition to organise events.\nI am also worried tri at the Union\nhasn't used this opportunity to create\na sabbatical with special responsibility\nfor the College sites at Silwood and\nnow St Mary's Medical School. St\nMary's don't have any sabbatical\nofficers and are in danger of being left\nout of the Union activities if there is\nno sabbatical officer who is prepared\nto travel between sites and encourage\nintegration. Do you really think that\nSt Mary's students will trek all the\nway over to IC just to attend a UGM?\nNot even most Civil Engineers are\nprepared to walk to the JCR to do\nthat!\nI would urge all Council members\nto think twice about these new job\ndescriptions and to amend them at the\nnext opportunity. I would also suggest\nthat once a decision has finally been\nmade about the Union, that it is no\nlonger left to Council to change but\nthat, like Union by-laws, job\ndescription changes have to go\nthrough two consecutive UGMs\nbefore being accepted. Every member\nof the Union should be able to have\na say on this subject.\nGuildsheet questionnaire\nI think that this questionnaire was so\nclever. I wish that I'd asked the same\nquestion as to whether people wanted\nIan Howgate as their President or not.\nPerhaps he would have tried to resign\nas well.\nPrinting\nThere is too much printing work\nfloating about this College to be fitted\ninto the Union Print Unit's busy\nschedule. I am also being asked to\nproduce St Mary's publicity. Perhaps\nit is time for a big shake-up in the\nFELIX Office. This means that I am\nunable to take on any personal\nprinting work for the for see able future. Sorry.\nCollation\nCollation is the subtle art of putting\nFELIX together every Thursday\nnight. All four thousand copies.\nRecently we have seen the number of\ncolla tors drop due to third year\nprojects and finals approaching. I would like to encourage more first\nyears to give up an hour on Thursday\nevenings to help us with this\nmammoth task, particularly those\nwho live in Beit Hostel. It's a chance\nto see FELIX before the rest of\nCollege does or before the Guilds\nPresident tries to steal it again! It's not a particularly exciting job, but\nthere are soft drinks on hand and\nyou'll get a credit in FELIX to say\nthank you.\nFinally...\nThere will be a special staff meeting\nin the Union Snack Bar today,\n1.00pm, to discuss next week's issue.\nAnybody is welcome to come.

    "content": "MALLEI\nGiselle\nGiselle is still regarded by many\npeople as the greatest ballet of all\ntime. It originates from the nineteen ch century, when ballet first became well\nknown and widely popular; especially\nromantic ballet. The story is simple\nbut effective, created by the French\npoet Theophile Gautier, who wrote\nthe scenario (based on a theme by\nHeinrich Heine) as a starring vehicle\nfor the young ballerina Carlotta Grisi.\nGiselle, a simple peasant girl, falls\nin love with a nobleman, Albrecht,\nwho pretends to be a peasant boy,\nLoys. The truth is revealed by\nHilarion, who is also in love with\nGiselle, and consequently madly\njealous of Albrecht. Albrecht is\nforced to admit that he must return to\nhis fiancee, the Pricess Bathilde. At\nthis point the ballet can go in either\nof two directions; either, Gizelle dies\nof a broken heart, or she stabs herself,\ndepending on the production and the\nballerina's preference. The Royal\nBallet follow the latter pathway,\nsensibly avoiding the heavily over-melodramatic atmosphere that the\nformer would produce. Giselle's taking of her own life increases the\nstature of her love for Albrecht and\nthe extent of her hurt at his deception;\nhaving her die of a broken heart\nwould simply make her a pawn with\nno control over her life and thus\nmaking little dramatic impact.\nAfter the deception and heartbreak\nof the first act, we are transported in\nthe second to Giselle's graveside.\nAlbrecht, filled with remorse, visits.\nHowever, Giselle has been\ntransformed into a 'Wili', a spirit of\nthe night, haunting the woods and\nobliged to lure men to dance until they\nare exhausted and die. The other\nWilis kill Hilarion in this way, and\nthe icy Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis,\nforces Giselle to attempt the same\nthing with the mourning Albrecht. But\nhe is saved, first by sheltering under\nthe cross on Giselle's grave and then\nbeing protected by dancing with\nGiselle, who defies the ghosts of other\njilted girls who have condemned\nAlbrecht to death. Dawn arrives, and\nGiselle returns to her grave, leaving\nAlbrecht to weep and repent.\nThe Royal Ballet's Giselle is\nvery coherent\u2014the story is clear, and\nevery attempt has been made to make\nit plausible. What must be\nremembered is that it is all ultra-romanticism, the battle of love and\nfaith against class distinctions,\njea lou y, the mystic forces of evil, and\neven death itself. And it works\nexcellently in the theatre. Even if\nAlbrecht is only toying with Giselle\nin the first act, his whimsy is turned\nto undying love by her death.\nThe role of Giselle has been\ndescribed as the Hamlet of ballet; it\ncalls for a combination of dramatic\nability, charm, personality and\ndancing skill, and the Royal Ballet's Lesley Collier has all of these. In the\nfirst act she suggests complete\ninfatuation with Albrecht, displaying\na nervous intensity and extreme\nsensitivity that makes her suicide\nwholly believable and justifiable. In\nthe second act she jumps high and\nlands silently, like a spirit, combining\nghostliness with concern and devotion\nfor Albrecht. Stephen Jefferies as\nAlbrecht is also excellent, especially\nin the jumps and exhausted falls of the\nsecond act.\nGiselle is worth going to see, even\nif it's the first and last time you ever\ngo to the ballet. You'll see one of the\nfinest ballets ever devised, and a great\nperformance of it. It's showing at the\nRoyal Opera House in Covent\nGarden; the dates are Friday Jan 29\nat 7.30pm, Friday Feb 5 at 7.30 and\nMonday Feb 8 at 7.30.\nlew s BOOKl\nI Write What I Like\nSteve Blko\u2014Penguin\nThis is a series of articles written by\none of South Africa's leading\ncampaigners against apartheid.\nIt is a very serious book, written by\nsomeone who risked detention and\nindeed can even be said to have died\nas a result of these writings.\nIt is , therefore, not really a book\nfor someone who does not have much\nknowledge of the situation in South\nAfrica, or who is not dedicated to\ngaining such knowledge.\nHaving said that, if it is read, the\nreader will be struck by the eloquence\nof the writing and by the messages put\nacross.\nB.M. South African Dispatches\nDonald Woods\u2014Penguin\nThis book helps give an idea of the\nsituation in South Africa ten years\nago. It is a collection of newspaper\narticles written for one of South\nAfrica's leading anti-apartheid\nnewspapers.\nIt is a poignant book, in which the\np retention s and absurdities of the then\nSouth African government have been\nc ace rated with a razor-sharp wit and\nclinically incisive analysis.\nDespite the political overtones,\nhowever, it is an extraordinarily easy\nbook to read which would captivate\neven the most ignorant of people.\nIt is in short, wry, witty, straight\nto the point and well worth reading.\nB.M. Between the Woods\nand the Water\nby Patrick Fermor\u2014Penguin\nIn 1933, aged 18, Patrick Leigh\nFermor set out to walk from the Hook\nof Holland to the Iron Gates on the\nRumanian-Yugoslav border. The first\npart of his tale is recounted in A Time\nfor Gifts. His second book magically\nreveals the journey through mountains\nand plains, and tells of the many\ndifferent people he met. A night with\ngypsies he felt sure would slit his\nthroat and take his borrowed horse\nwas very different from the weeks he\nspent enjoying life as a guest of a castle owner. In every chapter we\nrelive a new experience, experiences\nof the ancient ways of life that were\nsoon all to be swept away and lost\nforever, except in records such as\nthis. A remarkable travel book of\ncentral Europe before the war.\nr..G. STILL PLA Yim\nBigfoot and the Hendersons\u2014A standard Spielbergian all-American\nfamily encounter with the legendary\nBigfoot, and soon he's one of the\nfamily. Revoltingly cute, but\nentertaining nevertheless.\nCry Freedom\u2014Ostensibly the tale of\nSteve Biko, but ends up being the\nstory of newspaper editor Donald\nWoods, who became a personal friend\nof the black activist. An excellent\nfilm, the riot and police scenes\nprobably giving the most realistic idea\nof what it's like to actually live in\nSouth Africa and be a victim of\napartheid.\nSammy and Rosie Get Laid\u2014Some\nfunny stuff in the film from the same\nteam that brought you My Beautiful\nLaundrette, but the story wanders a bit, and gets too disjointed in parts.\nSpaceballs\u2014The Star Wars trilogy\ngets a good going over from Mel\nBrooks.

We aim to produce\nnews and entertainment programmes\nfor the students of Imperial College.\nLast year we moved from the College\nTelevision Studio to a new studio of\nour own in the Union Building.\nWe can offer experience in such\njobs as camera operation, vision\nmixing, sound mixing, editing,\nlighting, as well as actually presenting\nprogrammes, some of which are live.\nWe have a portable camera and\nrecorder, which we use to film events\naround College, such as Rag and\nevents involving Imperial around\nLondon.\nAt the moment we are trying to\nincrease our membership, to improve\nthe standards of our programmes, and\nto make them easier and more fun for\neverybody concerned. STOIC is not\njust something you can write on your\nCV\u2014we offer real, genuine\nWEIGHTS\nexperience in the field of television.\nSo if you are at all interested in any\naspect of television, why not drop in\nito our studio? We can be found on the\ntop floor of the Union Building (turn\nleft coming out of the lift). We have\nmeetings at the following times:\nMonday, 12.45pm Tuesday, 12.30pm Wednesday, 1.00pm Firday, 12.45pm and 6.00pm Our programme for the remainder\nof the term will be as follows:\nTuesday, 12.45pm: Events\nprogramme, covering events in and\naround IC, plus film and theatre\nreviews.\nThursday 1.00pm and 6.00pm: 'Newsbreak', IC's own news\nprogramme.\nFriday 7.00pm: Late night movie\nprogramme.\nSTOJC does stand for Student\nTelevision of Imeperial College\u2014so\nwhy not join in?\nTraining for beginners\nThere will be beginners' weight\ntraining courses this term. The course\nis split into four one-hour sessions,\nspread over four weeks. Each session\nwill start with instruction in six-eight\nbasic, essential exercises consisting of\nthe performance of two-three sets of\neach. The remaining part of the\nsession will be given over to the\ndiscussion and explanation of\nhandouts. The first handout will deal\nwith training routines and the\nexercises themselves, the second with\nnutrition and supplement ation, the\nthird with injury prevention and\ntreatment and stretching techniques\nand the fourth with techniques for\nincreasing power for sportsmen and\nthe role of the mind in training\nsessions.\nOne course has already started and\nis held on Wednesday from 1pm to\n2pm. A new course will start in the\nsixth week of term at the same time.\nA Tuesday course (1pm to 2pm) will\nstart in the fourth week of term.\nPeople interested in either course\nshould apply to Andrew Tay (Physics\n2) for the next Wednesday course and\nto C Donegan (Bio Chem PG) for the\nTuesday course. Each course is\ndesigned for four people only so early\napplication is essential. The cost will\nbe \u00a31.50 for the whole course.\nHAMSOC\nWe also need you!\nIn the past few years the Radio\nAmateur Society at Imperial College\n(or HAMSoc) has suffered from a falling membership level. This is\nprobably due to the fact that a licence\nis needed to use amateur radio\nequipment, and no Radio Amateur\nExaminations (which must be passed\nin order to qualify for a licence) have\nbeen held in the College for some\ntime.\nSeveral people showed an interest\nin obtaining a licence at the end of last\nyear, the candidates taking took the\nexam at C&G Examination\nHeadquarters early last December.\nHowever, people who wish to take the\nexam from now on can do so at\nCollege. If you have thought of\nobtaining a radio amateur licence in\nthe past, or think you may be\ninterested in amateur radio, why not\ncome along to a Club meeting\u2014held\non Wednesday afternoons at 1.15pm in the 'shack' (situated on the 3rd Floor of the Union Buiding in Beit\nQuad between STOIC and Micro\nClub) where you can find out what\nAmateur Radio is all about. HAMSoc\nwill help all prop sect ive candidates if\nthey wish to take the exam (it is not\ntoo difficult, honestly!) and will also\nwelcome people who already hold\ntransmitting licences and people who\nare interested in receiving (no licence\nis needed to 'listen in' on the amateur\nbands).\nAMNESTY\nCampaign for refugees and\nasylum seekers\nOver the next three months, the IC\nAmnesty Group will be joining with\nover 170 local Amnesty groups from\nall over the UK to publicise the plight\nof refugees and asylum seekers. They\nwill be organising public meetings,\nlobbying their MPs and MEPs, and\nraising the issue in the media and the\npress.\nThe campaign, which began on\nJanuary 21, calls for a major review\nof current Home Office practice and\nfor the introduction of a statutory\nright of appeal for all asylum seekers\nbefore removal from the UK.\nThe campaign, which is being coordinated by the British Section of Al,\nhas the support of all the major\nrefugee agencies, including the British\nRefugee Council, UK Immigrants\nAdvisory Service and the Joint\nCouncil for the Welfare of\nImmigrants. It is also part of an\ninternational campaign which is being\ncarried out by Al. Amnesty is concerned that\nrestrictive legislation has made it\nmore difficult for asylum seekers to\nreach the UK, and that current Home\nOffice procedures appear to be\narb it ary and unjust. Amnesty fears\nthat, since March 1987, some\nrefugees have been refused asylum\nand sent back<o countries where they\nface persecution,\nThe responsibility for ending\nhuman rights violations lies with the\ninternational community which not\nonly has a duty to help those fleeing\nstate repression, but also to work to\nend the human rights abuses that have\nled so many people into unwanted\nexile.\nFor more information, please come\nto our meetings: Tuesday 5.30pm, Brown Committee Room (3rd Floor\nUnion Building) or contact Monique\nYeo (Maths 2).\nFELIX Friday January 29th198815 "

Street life in China is\nremarkably cheap; tourism expensive,\nbut if you don't like forms of\napartheid, stay out of present day\nBeijing!\nTrain travel in China is not for the\nfainthearted, either. On trains hitting\na maximum of 40 mph, you rattle\nalong in an appallingly small and\ndingy 4-berthed cabin for at least 24\nhours; in the dining car you can watch\nthe insects move from the waste bin to your food and that's first class.\nAnother word to the wary westerners are still a novelty,\nespecially western females, so be\nprepared to be stared at.

Unfortunately we were by this\ntime heartily sick of China, so we\nmade it our main goal to sample the\nexcellent Chinese cuisine.\nIt is very difficult to manage on\nyour own in China. Outside Beijing\nhardly anyone speaks English and the\nChinese do not go out of their way\nto help\u2014understandable, considering\nthe resentment we must cause in\nthem. There is also a severe hotel\nshortage in Shanghai, so unless you\nwant to trudge round the city all day\nwith two rucksacks, book first.\nAfter China, Bangkok and the Thai\npeople were a much needed tonic.\nThe Thais are overwhelmingly\nfriendly, inquisitive and helpful.\nBangkok may have a lousy reputation\nand it is certainly the dirtiest city I 've\nseen, but it is vivid and cheerful. I wouldn't risk the market stall food\nagain though\u2014I was sick six times in\n24 hours, once in at uk t uk( electric\ntaxi) hurtling through the streets of\nBangkok.\nBut we needed a rest, and Bangkok,\nwith its magnificent temples, jewelled\n- . a it! and delight of Koh Samui.\nHere, we hired a beach hut,\nhammock included, for about \u00a32 a night. We sunbathed on the almost\ndeserted golden beaches, and swam\nin a sea so clear you could see your\ntoes. During the day we drank\n:\nWmm\nBuddhas and noisy nightlife certainly\nwasn't that, so we headed down South\n(on a modern train this time) to Koh\nSamui.\nMuch has been written about this\nbeautiful island which lies just off the\ncoast of the mainland, but nothing can\never get across the beauty, simplicity\nbuckets of iced fruit milkshakes and\nate coconut. At night we ate shark\nsteaks or gorgeously hot Thai curries\nbeneath the palm trees.\nOne day we hired a motorbike for\n\u00a38 and rode all the way around the\nisland, visiting the exquisite waterfalls\ninland.\nAdmittedly Koh Samui is filled\nwith Europeans, but definitely of the\nyoung weather beaten type, not the\nClub 18-30 mob.

    "content": "Entertaining Mr Sloane Widely acclaimed\nas one of the\nbest\nEntertainments\nChairmen in\nrecent times,\nJohn Noble has\nbeen the focus of\nattention since\nFreshers Week.\nHis wry sense of\nhumour and his\nenthusiasm for\nhis job has made\nhim one of the\nmost pleasant of\nUnion officers to\nwork with.\nFELIX took time\nout to talk to him\nabout his\nachievements,\ndisasters, life,\nloves, music\ninfluences and\nhis plans for the\nfuture.\nJohn has been one of the most\nsuccessful Entertainments Chairmen\nin recent times. He has developed an\nuncanny knack for plucking good,\npopular bands out of the hundreds\noffered to him by agents throughout\nthe UK: bands like Voice of the\nBeehive, the Real Sounds Of Africa\nand Jim Jiminee. John considers his\ngreatest achievement to be 'the selling\nout of this year's Carnival 88 although\nthe Real Sounds Of Africa came a very close second.'\nJohn was born in Ashington on the\nedge of Northumberland. He admits\nto going through both state and\nprivate education. He is quick to add\nthat he prefer ed his state school. His\nprivate prep school had told his\nparents that they thought he was\neducationally subnormal. John,\nhowever, shows no signs of this\ndiagnosis at Imperial where he is\ncurrently completing a degree in\nChemical Engineering. 'I didn't like\nmy prep school. They made you wear\nshorts until you were thirteen. And\nI didn't like that at all!'\nHe believes that his northern\nupbringing gave him his wry humour\nand that he was heavily influenced by\nthe Northern friendship which he\ndiscovered in his sixth form. T have\nloved music and entertainment all my\nlife and I suspect I always will. But\nabove all I like doing things and-working with people. Ents is\namazing. You learn so much like\nmanagement, promotion and so on.\nBut the most important thing this year\nhas been the sense of unity and\npurpose.'\nJohn is not an easy person to\ndescribe. He sees himself as 'very shy\nand a wee bit insecure.' If this is true,\nhe manages to conceal it very well.\n'I'm also a rather harsh person, but\nonly with the ones I love!' He is not\nconceited or vain, as such, but admits\nto 'not being the most humble of\npeople', despite his strenuous\nattempts to rectify that situation.\n'Managing to remain so completely\nand utterly humble whilst at the same\ntime suffering much public adoration\nis not only a great achievement but\nalso a completely fic tio us state of\nbeing!'\nJohn also revealed that he was\nundergoing a fitness programme since\ndiscovering that he liked eating food\ntoo much. He had resolved to diet it\naway in the new year but he didn't have the willpower. T do enjoy a few\nsmall beers every now and again.'\nHe is keen to mention his\nachievements but when questioned on\nhis failures his only reply is that he\nwill never be a popstar. He was\nbriefly in a College band called Blue\nBlue Ice, formed by a few friends,\nwhich sub seq u end y died a death when\nseveral members left last year. 'When\nI was young I was very into The\nPolice and Japan. My tastes have\naltered since then. At the moment I listen to the Christians, Blow\nMonkeys, Hip Sway and the Justified\nAncients of Mu Mu.'\nAs far as John's future goes, he is\ntrying to get into Research/\nDevelopment before heading into\nmanagement in either his own\ncompany or 'some ethical\norganisation, if any exist.'\nJohn also has plans for College\nentertainments. 'We've organised a Fifties night which should be\nexcellent value. Also we're planning\nan Indie night, maybe some Heavy\nRock and a Reggae band featuring\nBasil Gabbidon from Steel Pulse. The\nfinal highlight of the year will be the\nRag Ball next term. We've got some\nreally excellent bands planned for that\none!'\nIt is easy to see why Ents has been\nso successful under John's leadership.\nUnlike previous Chairmen he has\nremained dedicated to his job and still\nmaintains the same enthusiasm which |\nfirst spurred him into standing for the\npost. Let us hope that next year's Chairman will be able to live up to\nthe standards set by this year's.6 Friday January 29th1988 FELIX\n\n"

I do think though that I should\nbe given a chance to put the record straight.\nSteven Mercer alleged that I had 'deliberately implied'\nthat he supports infanticide. For this I was related to 'the\nlowest scum of the earth' and PATA attacked. I cannot\nreally complain about his fanatical use of language since\nI was given due warning. In the past people who disagree\nwith him have been labelled 'bigots' and 'uninformed and\nopinionated dross' (FELIX 783, 785).\nWhat does surprise me is how Steven Mercer worked\nout that I had 'deliberately implied' that he supports\ninfanticide. If he cares to read my letter he will see that\nI was appealing to his abhor en ce of infanticide to get him\nto address the issue of abortion on demand up to birth\n(NUS policy). If I implied anything it was that, like any\ndecent person, he is against infanticide. The 'deliberate'\npart of his accusation is even more ridiculous. I would\nnot accuse him of deliberately distorting my letter.

Is he only fishing\naround? Salmon sandwich anyone!\n\u2022 BRENDAN 'SLAPHEAD'\n3'Spud did not take too well to being\nfeatured in this column last week. He\nattacked a FELIX member of staff\nwith a ruler in Physics Lecture\nTheatre 1 and during a class work he\nglued his victim's pencil case to the\nbench and a question sheet onto his\nfolder.\nBARON 'What are we going to do?' said Dave\nBraincell, Clare MacUseless and\nJumping Jehosofat, 'we are the three\nclowns of Cheapskate\u2014we can't have\nany more clowns'.\nThey were worried because the\ncitizens' meeting had agreed to an\nidea that the Fundamentallawsofnaturetesters should have George, the\nLumpsofmetalworshippers Zippy and\nthe Diggingthingsoutoftheearthers\nBungle as their new pets. Captain\nBraincell was extremely pissed off that\nsomeone had suggested that he might\nbe confused with Bungle. 'There's no way that I could be mistaken\nfor that six foot high brown bear. He's much too intelligent for a start.\nAlso at the meeting and complaining was Fool Drool, the leader of\nthe citizens' at the Angel Gabriel's land for sick people. At the moment\nhis citizens were only honorary citizens of Cheapskate so he was only\nan honorary clown, but that didn't stop him from acting like a proper\none. 'What about my citizens' said Drool, 'we want some pets too.\nIf we don't get any pets then we're not joining Cheapskate. This was\nserious. Some decent pets had to be found for Drool and his citizens,\nand quickly. Dave Braincell thought hard but all he could think of was\nan Action Man, and that wasn't quite what Drool wanted. Jumping\nJehosofat was thinking about going for an extended session over the\nbar so he couldn't come up with anything. 'I know' said Clare\nMacUseless 'Why don't you have Rod, Jane and Freddy as your pets.\nThey look and sound like sick people already so they'd be perfect.'\n'Great' said Fool, 'the merger's on then'. With that he left, and went\nback to tell all the citizens of Angel Gabriel Land what a jolly nice bunch\nof people the citizens of Cheapskate really were.\nThe idea of the pets had been put to the citizens' meeting by a group\nof wacky students from Wholebean House after the meeting had been\ninterrupted by Martyn Prick.\nPrick was a new citizen and had soon become a multi-media hack.\nHe was the money counter for Radio Cheapskate and also a writer\nfor Phallix. It was his job soon to edit the 'Alternative Book of\nCheapskate' for which he had to produce a few new pages to go inside\nthe middle of last year's book by Sunny Brains. Brains was no longer\na citizen because she failed her tests but she still spent lots of time\nin the Phallix Office annoying Largeamounts as she stuck together\nher new magazine about funny silver 3-D pictures. Prick was a bit\nworried about the lack of articles for his book. 'Don't worry', said\nBrains, 'you could just invent it all like I did'.\nThe Phallix Office was an extremely busy and popular place to be\nthese days. Lots of magazines (Phallix, WetNerk, Lumpsofmetalsheet,\nCairo, the cover of Thinsheet) were produced there and they would\nsoon be joined by the Rug Mug. The new editors, Dai Rocking and\nGail Turnip had decided to make it bigger and better than last year's effort produced by Gehan de Silver Paper. They also planned to include\nsome jokes...\nAll these extra magazines meant lots of overtime for Rose Petal,\nthe pretty Phallix typist, and Dean Cockney, the Phallix printer, but\nthey weren't happy. 'It's not fair' said Petal, 'we weren't interviewed\nand given a2 page feature in Phallix when we started to work for\nthe citizens.'

    "content": "HP8\nvie by Adrian Grainger\nAlthough this is the day of the fourth\nround of the FA Cup, five of\nLondon's first division clubs are\naway, so that leaves just two cup\ngames in the city. I had a complaint\nlast week that I had been unfair to\nMill wall. I cannot print what the two\nMillwall fans said but I apologise if\nI was too harsh on their club. I must\nsay though that these previews are my\nown opinion and if anyone has\nanything to say or would like me to\nsay something special about a certain\nclub, then I would be grateful for a message through the Maths\npigeonholes. The previews are mainly\nfor neutral fans who would like to go\nto a game on the following Saturday.\nThe fans of the particular teams will\ngo regardless of what I say. If I think\nthat a certain game might be boring\nor there is a chance of crowd trouble,\nI will say so and leave it to the\njudgement of each spectator. Enough\nsaid.\nQPR vs West Ham Utd\nLoftus Road (Shepherds Bush tube)\nThis is the sort of tie that the Cup\noften throws up, a game between two\nof London's top teams whose only\nchance of a trophy this year lies in this\ncompetition. Two weeks ago there\nwas a dress rehearsal of this game in\nthe league and QPR were by far the\nbetter team for most of the game, but\nnot finding the net. A goal by Alan\nDickens 15 minutes from time gave\nthe Hammers an unexpected bonus of\n3 points. QPR have signed a brilliant\ndefender in Paul Parker from Fulham\nand his flair, along with that of,\namong others, Wayne Fereday, have\nmade QPR a side to fear. West Ham\nliked the plastic pitch and became the\nfirst team to win three games in a row\nthere on this surface. Tony Gale is\nback for West Ham and is providing\nthe required height, especially at\ncorners. Brady is in form with neat\nskills and nifty runs. It is often said\nthat the side who wins in the league\ngoes on to lose in the Cup, but I think\nthat a draw is the most likely result.\nThe game is 'all ticket' but it will\nprobably be possible to obtain tickets\non Friday or even Saturday.\nBrentford vs Grimsby\nGriffen Park (Brentford Central BR)\nThis Third Division match pairs a side\nin the promotion race against one\nwhich looks like it will go down.\nBrentford are having a good season\nand with a push near the end of the\nseason, they could climb up a league.\nThey have former Spurs captain Steve\nPerryman in their side and he is\nproving a real inspiration. Grimsby\nhad as pe rations of Division One\nfootball a few years ago but things\nhave turned sour since then. They do\nhave former Portsmouth striker Scott\nMcGarvey in their side though.\nBrentford should pick up maximum\npoints.\nAll games are on Saturday January\n30, kick off is 3pm. Leyton Orient vs\nNottingham Forest\nBrisbane Road (Leyton tube)\nThe real essence of the Cup is\ncaptured in this match. When the\nname of the Division One team came\nout of the hat (or rather velvet bag),\na tingle was felt by the 'O's' manager\nFrank Clark. The ex-Forest player\nwas called by Brian Clough 'the man\nwho I would most like to take over\nat the City Ground when I retire'\nCloughie is 52, so he still has a few\nyears left in him!! Orient are second\nin Division Four and coupled with the\nCup are having a great season.\nBrisbane Road is a good ground for\na team in that league and with home\nadvantage, Orient must fancy their\nchances. Forest aren't doing that bad\nthemselves and lie second only to\nLiverpool in Division One. They have\na selection of quality players such as\nEngland Midfield Neil Webb,\ndefender Stuart Pearce (also a recent\nfull cap for England) and ex-Orient\ndefender Colin Foster. Foster made\nnearly 200 appearances for Orient and\nis proving a great \u00a350,000\ninvestment. The game could provide\nan upset but I feel that Forest will\nmanage to draw and take them back\nto Nottingham to complete the job.\nMUSI\nby Phil Young C The event of this week will be the\nNicaraguan Solidarity Benefit gig on\nTuesday at the Town and Country\nClub, on the eve of President\nReagan's bid for more Contra aid.\nHeadlining are That Petrol Emotion,\na hard-hitting brilliant band for whom\nthe term 'Rock' is hardly adequate.\nDisplaying a wealth of talent and\nimagination, their music covers a wide range of tempos and is very\ndance able. This, together with a brilliant live act matching that of\nalmost any other, make this band in\nmy mind the best since The Smiths.\nSupporting are Voice of the Beehive,\nhighly overrated in terms of content\nbut good for a harmless bop.\nGig Review: Purple People Eaters,\nUnion Bar, Sat 23rd \u2014The Purple\nPeople Eaters can only be described\nas a musical experience not far\nremoved from those which they, and\ntheir fans, advocate. Rarely has music\nthis penetrating been heard in 20\nyears. Manic, screaming vocals\ncombined with keyboard and guitar\nsounds which just have to be termed\npsychedelic. The Doors influence is\nunmistakable in this non-stop\nfreak out, which had the room full of\nmoving, grooving people within\nminutes. Highlight of the evening for\nme was the literally brilliant rendition\nof Wild Thing. Do not take the band's warning lightly 'people entering the\ngig should abandon all logical thought\nprocesses, otherwise severe confusion\nmay result'. See this band at least\nonce if you want to experience\npsychedelia in a legal fashion.\nAlbum Review: Throwing\nMuses\u2014'The Fat Skiier'\u2014One thing\nthat has to be said about this band is\nthat they see no reason to restrict\nthemselves to any particular style.\nSome songs display a respectable\nsimilarity to Siouxie and the\nBanshees, others have more than a passing resemblance to James, and\nsome are pure folk. True, many bands\ntry to show off their range of abilities,\nbut this band seem to be able to turn\ntheir hand to anything and do it\nperfectly, adding their own distinctive\nflavour. This album contains quality\nsadly missing in today's music world,\nand for those prepared to think,\nprofoundly symbolist ic lyrics, worth\na listen.\n12 Friday January 29th1988 FELIX\n\n"

Possibly you know of\nsomeone who has had problems with\ndrugs or maybe you have dabbled\nyourself, or worse. Drug abuse is a problem that is globally gaining\nrecognition and much is being done\nto depose the drugs barons; there is\nhowever, much to be done to help\nthose providing the market.\nThere are many levels of drug\nabuse occur ing in this country's educational institutions alone and\nunfortunately many 'victims' are at\npresent beyond hope simply because\nnobody, bar their intimate associates,\nknows of their 'habit'. I say beyond\nhope at present because so few people\nrealise the enormous effect that their\nconcern could have in affecting a cure. I would like to bring about the\neducation of these friends so that they\ncan help, in any way possible, a friend\nin need. If anyone in this College\nwould like to get involved in such a scheme please leave your name with\nKathy in the Union Office and I shall\nget in touch.\nI would like to stress that this offer\nis open to any person whether a student, member of staff or otherwise.\nPlease help\u2014the rewards will be\nworth the effort.\nThanks in anticipation, ,\nSteve Mercer.\nI'm beginning to get slightly\nconcerned about the Union's Snack\nBar and its staff. I don't doubt that\nthey all work very hard and under\nconsiderable pressure but is this any\nexcuse for them to open and close at\nanytime which suits them? I was\nparticularly annoyed this Monday\nwhen I found it once again shut until\nfifteen minutes after its opening time.\nI was even less impressed when Ian\nHowgate, our illustrious President,\njumped the queue and took the last of\nthe main dish. I was not a happy\nperson. The main dish always runs\nout before I get to the serving place.\nI would prefer to eat around seven\neach night but there's never anything\nleft by then. And I never know when\nthe place is going to shut either. They\nshould officially stay on until nine in\nthe evening, but I 've frequent iy found\nit shut at eight.\nI once made, what I thought was,\na polite inquiry as to when they were\nplanning to open. Instead of giving\nme a civil answer, the insulting man\nat the cash till told me to come back\nlater because he had no idea when\nthey would be serving food. Is it any\nwonder that they're losing money?\nOn this point I'm going to have to\nlove you and leave you because I have\na stack of problem sheets to plough\nthrough and a personal tutor breathing\ndown my neck. I'm sorry that I 've\nhad to shorten my column this week\nby I need to get my degree as well.\nMay I just say a quick thank you\nto everybody who has written me\nletters of support this week.

    "content": "Academic Affairs:\nthe College\nquestionnaire and you\nYou may have noticed the Lecturer\nEvaluation Questionnaire circulating\nin departments. This article is a brief\ndescription of the purpose of the\nquestionnaire together with other\nitems of news in Academic Affairs.\nLecturer Evaluation Questionnaire\nFor a long time, students have been\nrunning their own questionnaires in\ndepartments\u2014but up to now, staff\nneed not have taken notice of them.\nWith the Lecturer Evaluation\nQuestionnaire, however, the results\nin future years will be used in lecturer\nappraisal. This is significant because\nin the past, student representatives\nhave complained that lecturers\nseemed to be promoted mostly on the\nquality of research and not on the\nquality of their teaching.\nThe questionnaire has been\ncirculating in most departments this\npast week and will continue next\nweek. In its present form the\nque sion n aire was designed by the\nCollege's Undergraduate Studies\nCommittee, upon which I sit.\nLecturing is not the only form of\nteaching; students are taught through\ntutorials, seminars, field work and\nlaboratory experiments. It is hoped to\nassess all of these in future years; I should stress that only with an overall\nsurvey of a lecturer's teaching can a fully objective assessment be made.\nFor the present the Committee is\nconcentrating on lecturing evaluation.\nCourse design\nIt has been noted that previous student\nquestionnaires have questions about\ncourse design as well as lecturing. In\ndesigning the questions the\nCommittee has been careful to include\nonly questions about the quality of\nteaching. It should be said that a badly\ndesigned course may be more difficult\nto lecture, however one of the\nobjectives of the questionnaire this\nyear is to establish a database from\nwhich the factors affecting a lecturer's score (e.g. a lecture at 4.30 on Friday\nmay not be very well received) can\nbe assessed. For this reason the\nresults won't be published but each\nlecturer will be sent a copy of his/her\nown results. In future years the results\nwill be published more widely\u2014\nexactly how this will be done hasn't been decided yet.\nWhere do student reps fit in?\nYour Departmental Representative is\nresponsible for organising the student\nside of the questionnaire in your\ndepartment. He or she will have\ndecided with your department's staff\nco-or d in at or which courses/lecturers\nare to be assessed and when the\nfilling-in of the questionnaire will take\nplace. My role as the Union's Academic Affairs Officer is assuming\noverall responsibility for the student\nside of the questionnaire with the Dep\nReps and at the same time liaising\nwith the staff in the Registry (who are\nprocessing the questionnaire) and the\nmembers of the Undergraduate\nStudies Committee involved with the\nquestion ni are. Elections\nPapers are now up for 3 posts: 1) 2\nordinary members of the Union\nAcademic Affairs Committee (in the\nUnion Foyer). Any student can stand\nfor this post\u2014you need a proposer\nA letter from St Mary's What makes St Mary's the most\npopular medical school in the\ncountry?\nLast year, of a total of 8,000\napplications to medical schools in the\nUnited Kingdom, 2756 students\napplied to St Mary's, that is one in\nthree prospective medical students\napply to St Mary's in the UK. Given\nthat the medical school has an intake-of only 100 students per year (with\n500 students in total) such a proportion of the applications must\nmean something.\nThe cynic would say that St Mary's always looks at people who place\nthem 4th/5 th on the UCCA form,\nhence those who are looking to fill in\nthe lower order usefully will be predisposed towards this institute. While\nthis may be a factor in this\nphenomenon, it is in no way the\nand 10 second ers. If you've not been\na member of any committee before,\ndon't worry. This is an excellent way\nto start getting involved as no\nexperience is required. 2) School of\nManagement Department\nRepresentative for this year (in the\ncommon room in 53 Princes Gate).\nYou need a proposer and 5 second ers, all of whom should be students of the\nSchool. If you are interested in\nstanding and would like to know more\nplease get in touch via the IC Union\nOffice. Papers will also be going up\nin Departments soon for next year's Dep Reps.\nNoticeboard\nAll notices about Academic Affairs\nare posted up on the new Academic\nAffairs noticeboard in the Union\nFoyer. I will try and ensure that all\nreport, job descriptions, minutes etc.\ngo up\u2014you'll be able to see exactly\nwhat I 've been up to. Details of\nforthcoming meetings and other\nevents will also be posted up.\nThat just about wraps it up for\nnow\u2014remember if you have any\nacademic problems, questions or\nsimply want to get involved with the\nmost important area of Union\nbusiness then get in touch with me via\nBiochem pigeon holes or the IC\nUnion (x3500) or drop in for a cup\nof coffee in my room\u201413 Beit Hall.\nYou'll always be welcome.\nCharles Brereton\nIC Union Academic Affairs Officer\noverriding cause. Life here is\ndifferent to other medical schools, as\ncan be seen from the handbook sent\nto all prospective applicants\nrequesting information.\nThis medical school looks at the\n'whole' person, offering places to\nthose persons who have varied\ninterests, with academic excellence a major, but not the final determination.\nWe have a large minority of mature\nstudents here that other medical\nschools will not even consider, to\ntheir de tre ment. The mature students\nform a large and active part of the\nschool, without which we would be\nall the poorer.\nThis variety in the intake is healthy\nfor the school, as it is not necessarily\nthe workaholic bookworm who makes\na good doctor. However much the\ntrend is towards producing scientific\ndoctors, the fact that we have to study\nand pass courses in Psychology and\nSociology adds an important non-scientific dimension.\nIt has been a proud claim that St\nMary's produces if not the best, then\nsome of the better doctors practising\nin medicine today. This must be a product of the current ethos here:\nwork hard, but more importantly,\nplay hard.\nPapers are up for the following\nposts:\nExternal Affairs Officer (this year).\n2 Ordinary Members of Council for next\nacademic year.\n2 Ordinary Members of UFC for next\nacademic year.\nPapers will remain up until 4th February unless there are insufficient\ncandidates; elections will take place\nat the UGM on 9th February.\nWest London Chaplaincies Science\nand Religion Series\nA talk on Hindu & Buddhist Attitudes to the\nConflict Between Science and Religion\nby\nMichael Barnes\nLecturer in Comparative Religion, London University\nMonday 1st February at 7.30pm IC Physics Dept Level 8 Common Room\nFriday January 29th1988 FELIX\n\n"

Mr Howgate told FELIX\nthat the accommodation was in 'a very\npoor state' and'would probably be\nshut down if the Health and Safety\nOfficer saw it. 'It is potentially\ndangerous: they've had a fire there\nalready', he said.\nFELIX tried to contact College\nAssistant Secretary Michael Arthur\nbut he was unavailable to comment on\nthe situation.\nr HE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION "

With the UAU\nfinals and the EVA Student Cup only\na few weeks away, every match win\nis important for morale and\nconfidence. This week's fixture\nbrought Varsovia, league leaders, to\nSouth Kensington, albeit without their\nfinest s piker. Varsovia train at\n(National League First Division)\nPolonia, and the presence of some of\nthe Polonia squad was obvious on\ncourt. Nevertheless, Imperial took an\nearly lead of eight points to nothing\nin the first set, only to see it brushed\naway by the powerful opposition. The\nsecond set demonstrated why\nVarsovia were top of the division,\nSAILING\nPlain Sailing\nContinuing their recent run of\nsuccess, the IC sailing team\noverwhelmed Cambridge last\nSaturday. With good wind, for the\nfirst time this academic year,\nconfidence, before racing started, was\nhigh. (Comma fixation!?\u2014Sp. Ed.)\nThe first race set the scene for the\nday with IC dominating Cambridge\nat the start and sailing into an\nunbeatable lead during the first leg.\nAggressive tactics by Cambridge\nforced a few IC errors, but the team\nrecovered to win 1st,2 nd and 5th( out\nof six boats).\nThe second race followed the same\nJUDO\nIppon\nLast weekend saw the Crystal Palace\nNational Centre packed with judo\nplayers from 38 universities, poly s and colleges for the BUSF/BSSF Judo\nChampionships. In the individual\nevents on Saturday, London took a silver and four bronze medals, with\none player being selected for the\nBritish National Student Squad. On\nSunday, London regained its title as\nBUSF team champions (temporarily\non loan to Oxford last year!), beating\nGlasgow in an extremely close fought\nfinal. Peter Swettenham from IC was\none of the two most successful\ncompetitors in London's five man\nteam, winning four out of his five\nfights.\nwhen they built a solid lead against\na weakening Imperial and rode out\neasy winners. An arrogant\nsubstitution by Varsovia at the start\nof the third set, however, allowed-Imperial to recover and start getting\ntheir act together. With intelligent and\nsolid play from the likes of Neil\nBruce, and outstanding commitment\nfrom Pavlos Protapapas, Imperial\neasily took the set, and Varsovia,\nback to full strength on court looked\nless than happy. The final two sets\nwere frantic affairs, with blistering\nspikes being recovered from all over\ncourt on both sides, before the\nconsistent power of Walter Sextro and\nVincent Lebeault won through. All in\nall, this must be said to be a match\nof good first division standard, which\nbodes well for the campaign ahead.\npattern as the first with IC again\nwinning 1st,2 nd and 5th. This proved\nto be the case for the rest of the day.\nIn total ten races were sailed with IC\nwinning every one, usually 1st and\n2nd. Apostolos Leonidhopolous was\neasily the best helm, winning most of\nthe races, no doubt helped by the\nextra coaching he received over\nChristmas, while consistent sailing by\nBill Chard, despite undergoing some\nidentity crises, ensured IC success.\nEven the captain achieved a notable\nvictory, avoiding fellow team-mates\nin the final race, and with a fair turn\nof speed, finished first!\nLater on Sunday, the area team\nchampionship was won by Scotland\nfor the eighth time in a row\u2014not\nsurprising since they can chose\nplayers from 17 universities! SouthEastern area was placed second, and\nLondon third\u2014no mean feat\nconsidering the strange geography of\nthe area groupings. IC contributed\nthree players to London's ten-man\narea team\u2014Peter Swettenham,\nJonathan Lean and Henry Young.\nThis was more than any other single\nLondon college, reflecting the fact\nthat IC currently has the premiere\nLondon college judo club. Watch this\nspace for the res uj ts of the UL intercollegiate team championships.\nFOOTBALL\nNHS Bashing\nIC-9\nLondon Hospitals\u20143\nthe pitch was holding a lot of water\nand it was always going to make the\ngame a hard one.\nThe first goal came very early on\nin the game: Simon Cole beat a couple\nof defenders and then shot from\noutside the box. It looked as if IC\nwere going to get a hand full of goals\nbut London Hospitals quickly\nequalise d from a corner.\nIC seemed to let the game slip and\nLondon Hospitals started to put the\nDisappointing\nICl New College\u20143\nIC started the game in good form, as\nif the Christmas period had not left\ntoo much of an impression. They\ndominated the game for the first\ntwenty mint u es but then they seemed\nto ease off and let New College get\nback into the game.\nNew College scored the first goal,\nwhich came after a corner from New\nCollege. IC tried to play the offside\ntrap and failed. The ball was passed\nthrough the IC defence which was left\nsquare on to which a New College\nPeel Power\nGoldsmiths II\u20144\nIC II\u20145\nWith Captain Jezz Holland making\nhis welcome return to the high flying\nIC team, hopes were high of beating\ntitle rivals Goldsmiths. The game\nstarted badly for IC when Goldsmiths\nscored after ten minutes. But they\nwere soon back in the game when\nGuy Phiri grabbed the equalise r. Goldsmiths then regained their lead\nfrom a hotly disputed penalty. They\nwent 3-1 up when Chris Burton just\nfailed to clear off the line. IC then\nstarted playing and pressure paid off\nwhen Alan Glass converted IC's second, after good work from Guy\nPhiri. After the change of ends, with\nIC now playing downhill, the midfield\nstarted working well as a solid unit,\nIC defence under a lot of pressure. A goal mouth scramble led to London\nHospitals scoring a second.\nTwo minutes from half-time IC\nequalise d. IC started the second half looking\na different team and an early goal put\nIC in front. From this point on IC\ndominated the game; they went on to\nmake the score 9-3. The goals came\nfrom Nigel Collier with four, Simon\nCole and Adam Thomas with two and\nPaul Olden with one.\nplayer ran and slipped it passed the\nstranded IC goalie.\nIn the second half New College\nmanaged to capital is e on their lead.\nThe ball was crossed from the lefthand side of the pitch only for it to\ncome off the head of an IC defender\nand fall nicely in the path of an\nawaiting New College player.\nIC made it 2-1 when Phil Ewart\nmanaged to get a foot to the ball in\na goal mouth scramble, but New\nCollege put the game beyond IC's reach when they made it 3-1.\ncontrolling the middle of the park.\nThis extra effort was rewarded when\nPip Peel found the net with a close\nrange shot. With their tails up, IC\nsearched for a winner. This was\nprovided when Rakesh Muthoo,\nplaying one of his best games for IC,\ndanced through Goldsmiths defence,\nand curled the ball past the advancing\nkeeper. IC's lead was consolidated\nfive minutes later when Pip Peel's25 yard, first time drive rocketed into the\nnet to give IC a53 lead. IC then sat\nback to play out the remaining time,\nbut a rare mistake allowed Goldsmiths\na fourth goal. This victory\nconsolidates IC 2nds top of the table\nposition, and promotion is now a real\npossibility.\n1\n6 Friday January 29th1988 FELIX\n\n"

Gorman advocates\nindividualism, where personal freedom is achieved through\nwealth alone, a regime found in the USA. Personally I believe that such a system only encourages greed and\nincreases disparity between the rich and poor resulting\nin more crime and violence in society. Secondly, a system\nbased on profit can only be to the disadvantage of the less\nwealthy, strangled by costly insurance premiums.\nThe talk itself, I found disgusting and the question-time\nafterwards shocking.

In its yup pines s it is\nbeginning to rival the docklands of London. It was the\nfirst town in Britain to have its own credit card. It has\nthree large specialist car showrooms for a population of\nonly 30,000. Nearby Prestbury has the second largest\nnumber of Rolls Royces per head in Britain (after\nMayfair). Wilmslow is also excessively right-wing. The\nlast police chief made national news when he explained\nthat it was obvious which people in Wilmslow were\nthieves\u2014the ones with black skin.\nHouse prices in Wilmslow are twice those in nearby\ntowns forcing people born there to move out as\nManchester's yuppies move into the new Wimpey homes\nspringing up all over green belt land.\nIn short Wilmslow comes second in na ff ness after the\nKings Road.\nYours,\nRupert Clayton, Chem Eng I.

As a result I have\nhad to chase up these Dep Reps so that they could pick\nup supplies.

    "content": "Feat Li res\nTHE GREAT ESCAPE\nLast summer I amazed my family\nand friends by not\nonly venturing out\nof Europe for the\nfirst time in\nnineteen years, but\nby taking a world\ncircuit which\nincluded the USA,\nHong Kong,\nThailand and\nChina.\nThe ticket, which cost a mere \u00a3705\nincluded stop-offs at New York,\nHonolulu, Taipei, Hong Kong,\nSingapore and Bangkok, although we\neventually reorganised our timetable\nto suit our inclinations and our\npockets. My boyfriend and I organised the whole thing with STA\nand I flew out to meet him in New\nYork, with nothing more solid than\nthe ticket, the interconnecting flight\nticket between NY and LA, and a couple of first night accommodation\nbookings.\nI loved America, although it was at\nthe same time better and worse than\nI anticipated\u2014better because the\nAmericans at home (or even on\nholiday at home) are so much\npleasanter than Americans on holiday\nin London; worse because it was\ninfinitely more expensive!\nHowever, from the hectic pace of\nNew York (we were there for 24\nhours and walked 80 blocks), to the\nsurf y beaches of California and the\ndeserts between Las Vegas and San\nFrancisco, it was an incredible\nexperience.\nWe had hired a car through STA\nto pick up at LA. This sort of thing\nis worth taking care over\u2014STA had\nnot informed us that we would be\nrequired to pay an extra $60 insurance\non collection. In addition, the\nsalesmen are very strong on the 'Oh,\nyou don't want that one' trick. We\nresisted all persuasion to pay 'a little\nextra for a lot more' and were quite\nsatisfied with our 'bottom of the\nrange' Dodge!\nAnother thing to be wary of is that\nthere is no such thing as a cheap motel\nin California\u2014we spent three nights\nsleeping in the car and were once\nmoved on by a traffic cop who\nthought we were drunks but became\nincredibly sympathetic when he\ndiscovered that we were English. This\nlast situation was an endearing\ncharacteristic which we met almost\neverywhere (along with 'You come\nfrom London? Wow\u2014do you know\nmy Aunt, she lives in\nWimbledon/Surrey etc?).\nLas Vegas is an incredible place\nand also cheap if you can keep off the\nbetting\u2014not difficult for me as the\nminimum legal age is 21. We arrived\nat 8pm and it was 101 \u00b0F( the\nbeginning of August). In Caesar's Palace we met a genuine heiress and\nher gigolo who invited us to stay at\nher mansion in Texas. Pity we had\nsuch a tight schedule.\nMost people visit Hong Kong for\nthe shopping, and I must admit we did\nIn Hong Kong, we obtained the\nvisas for our next stage\u2014China\u2014and\na one way flight to Peking. We\nplanned, despite the horror exhibited\nat the travel agents, to return by train\nvia Shanghai and Guangshou.\nI would personally dissuade anyone\nfrom visiting China the way we did.\nTravel books may rave about seeing\nspend several days simply walking\naround its maze of identically\ncrowded streets.\nIn Hong Kong, we clocked up our\nonly major grumble with STA, whose\nbooking had never reached the hotel\nfor which we had a prepaid voucher.\nHowever the YMCA we stayed in\nwas excellent (and totally unlike the\nEuropean idea of a YMCA).\nLike everyone, we took the peak\ntram up to Victoria (?) Peak and\nlooked down on the city rising\nbreathtakingly from the green hills.\nUnlike everyone, we also took a ferry\nout to Lantau Island, one of the\nnumerous small islands surrounding\nHong Kong. The white sand beach\nwas beautiful and peaceful, although\nI nearly got sunstroke and the local\nbuses were definitely driven at Hong\nKong pace.\nI wouldn't recommend Aberdeen,\nthe floating village, to the weak\nstomached. Dirty, polluted and\nstinking of fish and poverty, it makes\na stark contrast to Hong Kong's night spots and other treats for the\nwestern visitor. You will also be\nsubjected to a persistent 'Sampan\nround the bay, sir?' by a horde of fat,\numbrella carrying women.\nthe locals at their own level, but at\nthe moment China seems unable to\ncope with tourists in twos and threes.\nIf I ever return to China, which is\nunlikely, I would go on a tour. From\nthe moment we were frog marched through customs, I had an uneasy\nfeeling about China, which four days\nin Beijing did nothing to dispel.\nBeijing is visually stunning\u2014in parts.\nThe Great Wall is magnificent, the\nrelics of Imperial China are numerous\nand beautiful, though in some\ndisrepair. Even the People's Square\nand the bicycle jams are worth seeing.\nHowever, there are many facets of Beijing life which do little to reflect1 credit on Chinese socialism.\nThe worst thing about China is the\ndual currency system. Only\nforeigners (and, one would suspect,:\nhigh level politicians and generals) are\nallowed to hold Foreign Exchange\nCertification, while the man in the\nstreet has Yuan. Theoretically, 11\nYuan = 1 FEC but in actual fact 1\n1\nFEC is approximately 3.5 Yuan\nbecause of the privileges embodied in\nFEC.\nFor a start, taxi drivers will only\naccept FEC, and while the Beijing\ntaxi service has to be the worst in the\n8 Friday January 29th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "The next three pages in no way encompass the whole range of\npackages on offer to the student traveller. They simply\nhighlight three very popular ways of spending the long\nvacation.\nA month's unlimited travel in Europe\nsounds a bit of a snip, even if you\nhave to shell out \u00a3139 for the\nprivilege. Interrailing has become a standard holiday alternative for\nhoards of adventure-hungry students\nand it can be anything from a leisurely\ncruise, a 'culture' tour or an initiative\ntest trying to cram as many miles as\npossible into the month with the least\npossible expenditure.\nFor your \u00a3140 or so, providing you\nare under 26 on the first day of your\nticket's validity, you can travel second\nclass without charge through twenty\nEuropean countries and Morocco.\nFirst class travel is available if you\nmake up the difference in ticket\nprices. It's normally possible to buy\nyour ticket straight away but it may\ntake a week or more, so it's wise not\nto leave things to the last minute.\nKeep the counter foil from the\napplication form, because if your\nticket is lost or stolen it could help you\nget a replacement. It is necessary to\npresent your passport when buying\nthe ticket\u2014it has to be a passport\nissued by a participating country\u2014\nand the ticket isn't valid without the\npassport either. You have to have the\nticket with you while travelling, so\ninsurance might be a good idea.\nIf you decide to sleep on trains, the\nmost obvious option is to crash out\non a seat. However, an Interrail ticket\ndoesn't guarantee a seat or sleeping\ncompartment\u2014reserve a seat to be\nsure you get one\u2014and you may not\nfeel quite refreshed enough to tackle\nthe next day's sightseeing.\nOther than this, you could take a couch et te, which is a compartment\nwhich converts from seats to berths\nfor six people and includes a sheet,\npillow and blanket. A full sleeping car\nis more luxurious but much more\nexpensive.\nIf, on the other hand, you want to\nsleep on something a little more solid,\nthere are more than 1,900 Youth\nHostels in the countries covered by\nInterrail. The YMCA also provides\n'budget priced accommodation' for\nboth men and women. You could also\ninvestigate small hotels and guest\nhouses, which may be reasonably\npriced.\nHaving decided to go Interrailing,\nthe next thing to do is to work out\nwhere you want to go. Unfortunately,\nthe price of the ticket does not include\ntravel in the United Kingdom, which\nseems a bit of a con really although\nthey offer up to 50% off rail prices.\nYou will also have to cross the\nchannel or Irish Sea\u2014discounts are\navailable on some ferry and\nhovercraft routes.\nBefore you start, you have to fill\nin your final destination on the\nticket\u2014in other words the furthest you\nwill travel. Bear in mind that Eastern\nBloc countries require visas as well\nas passports. It might also be a good\nidea to obtain a European timetable\n(these are available from Thomas\nCook). This timetable will enable you\nto plan your journey fully, if that is\nyour intention, it will also help you\nto decide where you will sleep during\nthe holiday, a consideration to be\noverlooked at your peril.\nIf you are really serious about\nInterrailing, an invaluable book is\nEurope by Train by Katie Wood and\nGeorge McDonald, published by\nFontana. As well as details on the\nvarious countries and general advice,\nit outlines some other schemes such\nas Transalpino and Eurotrain which\nare similar but have less flexibility in\nallowed routes.\nIf your intention is to cover a large\ndistance on your holiday, you may\nfind Interrailing the most suitable\noption. Perhaps Circle Line parties\nwill give way to Continental circuit\nraces or most-miles-in-a month\ncontests, who can tell what zany\njaunts Imperial students will get up to\nnext?\nTaking\nthe trail\nYouth Hostelling is gaining in\npopularity and is undergoing a change\nin image, recognising that many\nYouth Hostellers like to go to have\na tipple and stay up late (however on\npopular long distance walk routes\nthere may often be enough of the\n'lights out at ten' brigade to ensure\nan early night). Annual membership\nfor IC students would be \u00a33.50 (for\nEngland and Wales) and when a passport sized photo is attached, the\nmembership card will open up\npossibilities to hostel abroad.\nThere are organised active holidays\nwhich last for a week or a few days\nwhere you can learn how to windsurf,\nalternatively there are special interest\nbreaks where everything from\nsketching in Cornwall to folk music\non the Chilterns. These holidays cost\nbetween \u00a320 to \u00a325 for a weekend and\n\u00a3100 to \u00a3180 for a week and up to\n\u00a3300 for the very long walks.\nContinental hostels tend to be much\nmore comfortable than British ones.\nIt can be fun to hire a bike and tour\naround the low countries, organised\nweeks cost around \u00a3180 which\nincludes hotel accommodation, return\nrail travel and some meals. Holidays\nwith full board such as 'Rhine Valley\nRambling' cost in the region of \u00a3250.\nMore exotic Y HA travel offers\ninclude 'Insight Into Egypt and Israel'\nfor about \u00a3665 ft Sra fortnight which\nincludes guided tours of the many\nhistoric places of interest. More of a proper introduction to an area than\nyour average Club 18-30 holiday, but\nyou pays your money and you takes\nyour choice.\nFull details in Y HA Handbook,\nTerra Nova (YHA Travel) and 'Great\nEurope' brochures.\nFELIX Friday January 29th19887 "
