    "content": "FRIDAY 25TH FEBRUARY 2022\n21\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nWritten by Tara Pal Chaudhuri Music Editor\nIremember sitting in my mum's hatchback with a\ncousin when she first introduced me to alt-J. For\na few years after, I'd struggle to explain why \"Taro\".\nfrom alt-J's 2012 debut, 'An\nAwesome Wave', was one of\nthe most played songs in my\nlibrary. It sat silently in the\nmidst of easily compressible\nAmerican Top 40 songs I'd\npicked off the charts thinking\nI was a true music connoisseur.\n\"Taro\"waslikenothingI\u2019dever\nheard at the tender age of 13.\nIt describes war photographer\nRobert Capa\u2019s dying moments\nand his reunion with his former lover, Gerda Taro, also a war photographer who\nhad lost her life earlier in during the Battle of Brunete,\nall sung against a folktronica interpretation of the Indochina war.\nA majority of alt-J's critique over the years has revolved around their sombre outlook of the world and\nhow they channel that darkness into their music. For\ninstance, Joe Newman, the band's vocalist and gui-tarist, avoids talking about the murder of\nhis friend's sister but allows that\ntrauma to veil his songwrit-ing. Nevertheless, what\u2019s\ndrawn me to their\nmusic is their\ncultivation\nof a\nunique sound that blends storytelling and obscure\nreferences. But when asked about references that may\nhave escaped listeners on an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d session hosted on the r/Music subreddit,\nGus Unger-Hamilton (keyboard and\nbacking vocals) and Thom Sonny-Green\n(drums) realised that they\u2019ve slowly\ngained the confidence to wean off referring to other people\u2019s work. \u201cI think in\na way it was partly that we felt a little bit\nof insecurity and almost imposter syndrome,\u201d explained Gus. \u201cWe started out\nas a band, because we were quite young\nand, you know, essentially just like kids\nat university without a huge amount of\nlife experience.\u201d\nIt is exactly this search for inspiration from within that birthed most tracks on the album. The album\nopens with a satiated sigh after a crisp sample of a can\nopening, promptly replaced by alt-J\u2019s characteristic\nambient guitar twangs and reverberating drums. It\u2019s\na penetrating sound that chills your bones \u2013 and I\u2019ve\nmissed it so much over their five-year hiatus. Despite\n\u201cBane\u201d\u2019s immersive and intoxicating nature, complete\nwith a choir, organ, crumhorn and cello, you\u2019d be surprised to know it\u2019s simply an ode to Coca-Cola.\n\u201cHard Drive Gold\u201d, the third track and single of the\nalbum,iswhatI\u2019dimaginealt-JtomakeifJoeNewman\nreplacedSharpayEvansasthemainantagonistinHigh\nSchool Musical. Just as \"Fabulous\" from HSM2 flaunts\nSharpay\u2019s (very pink and rich) lifestyle, 'Hard Drive\nGold'isacatchy,quick-tempoedsongabouttheappeal\nof cryptocurrency, evidenced by a refrain that hasn\u2019t\nleft my head since I first heard it: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, to\nmake, to make money, boy!\u201d\n\u201cThe Actor\u201d, also the fourth single released from\nthe album, is what Joe describes as an \u201cimagined retelling of John Belushi\u2019s death\nin the Chateau Marmont\u201d. In the '80s,\nAmerican comedian John Belushi was\npounding every door for money to buy\ndrugs until he was given a fatal shot\nof heroin and cocaine, known as a\nspeedball. The event exemplified\n'80s drug-steeped America, and\nwas reworked to tell the story\nofafailingactor\u201cinthedeepest end of an empty pool\u201d\nliving it large with drugs,\ncameras and paparaz-zis in a lavish hotel.\nThe song begins with\na brittle guitar riff that\nsegues into a laid-back\nhead-nodding rhythm\ntaking listeners back to\n\"this whole '80s, Reagan, drug-excess world\",\nas Joe explains.\nThechorusofthesecondsinglefromthealbum,\u201cGet\nBetter\u201d, started out as a short refrain Newman sang to\nhis girlfriend having period pains. Newman then wove\nit into an intricate, yet poignant narrative from the\nperspective of a man who lost his partner. The lyrics\nreference their common love for Elliot Smith\u2019s music,\na meeting at the Serpentine as once young lovers, and\ncringing at \u201cI Love You\u201ds in ICUs. It\u2019s a delicate song.\nThey lose their reverbed vocals, and replace them with\nharmonies (brought to you by Unger-Hamilton Ltd.),\nbut mostly reorient their familiar musical technique to\nfocus on the softness of Newman\u2019s voice. You can tell\nthey want you to listen to his lyrics \u2013 or rather, poetry.\nAlthough this isn\u2019t their most notable track, there\u2019s\nsomething to say about the minute-long \u201cDelta\u201d because it\u2019s such a strong example of the mindfuck that\nalt-J embodies as a band. What inspired it? Why, of\ncourse, the well-known devotion you feel as an atheist\nwhen you\u2019re standing in the Mississippi delta and witness aliens descending from the sky. A prayer devoid\nof instruments barring the trademark Newman-Unger-Hamilton vocals, \"Delta\" features my favourite lyrics\nin the whole album: \"Force fields in the delta/I'm not a\nprayer man/But I'll kneel to that\".\nThe album ends with \u201cPowders\u201d, which I didn\u2019t listen to as much because of my poor album-reviewing\netiquette. When I love an album, I want to listen to it\nfrom the beginning every time \u2013 and each time I don\u2019t\nmake it to the end. But something changed and I spent\na whole day listening to \u201cPowders\u201d on loop. Newman\ndescribes the song, inspired by teenage love in America, as being about \u201cthe spark when you see someone\nacross the room and you\u2019re like, \u2018I want to get to know\nthem tonight\u2019.\u201d Away from the dark, yet amusing, chaos that permeates the rest of the album, this song feels\nlike, what I\u2019d best describe as, romantic meditation. It\nstarts with Newman\u2019s iconic meandering vocals back-dropped by the sound of the sea. The music grows to a\nsoft build-up where the instruments hold their breath,\nandagentlerhythmicreleasefollowedbyarelaxedgui-tar sequence. The song also sees alt-J dabbling in short\nspoken word insertions, particularly inspired by a Malcolm Gladwell podcast and enacted by Thom and his\ngirlfriend.\nAs a critic, I'd urge you to listen to the album as soon\nas you can. But as a devout fan of the Leeds trio, I'd\ngenuinely request you to read lyrics in the album. No\nartist I can think of can pull a story out of thin air, shift\na lens there never was, and allow the world to see it\nfrom an entirely unexpected perspective.\nAlt-J Have Not Been Caught Napping\nHow do you recreate the magic of a Mercury Award-winning debut from a decade ago? This is fucking how.\n\n"

    "content": "Implications of a hawkish shift by the ECB\nInflation, Inflation, Inflation...\nAn inflation hawk, also known in monetary jargon as a \u2018hawk\u2019, is a policymaker or advisor who is predominantly concerned with the potential impact of interest\nrates as they relate to a fiscal policy. Hawks are seen as willing to allow interest rates to rise in order to keep inflation under control.\nA HAWK, YOU SAY... WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\nHye Oh\nWriter\nWhat has the President of the European Central Bank,\nChristine Lagarde, been up to? Hye Oh discusses below.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n22 Investment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Ahmad Danesh\nInvestment Investment Society\nImperial College London\nSo,what\u2019sbeengoingonhere?Let\u2019sfirst\ntalk about current Eurozone Inflation!\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has\nexecuted 1.85 trillion euro quantitative easing policies\nto recover the European economy since Covid-19.\nIt has been reported that the monetary policies were\nsuccessful at reaching its target inflation rate of 2 per\ncent and at lubricating the eurozone\u2019s monetary flows.\nHowever, recently, it is also reported that the European\neconomy\u2019s inflation rate has exceeded its ideal target\nrate.\nAs the figure above shows, in January 2022, the EU has\nreached the highest inflation rate, 5.1%, in six years,\nexceeding the ECB\u2019s expectations. The overheating has\nresultedfromquantitativeeasing.EventhoughtheECB\nhas insisted to freeze interest rates at low levels until\nnext year with a comment \u201cevery reason not to act as\nquickly or as ruthlessly\u201d, it is predicted that persistently\nhigh inflation will push the ECB to raise their interest\nrates within this year.\nSo, what factors have driven inflation upwards?\nDriving Factors of High Inflation\nEnergy prices in the eurozone sharply climbed nearly\n30 per cent in early 2022. Europe has faced volatility in\nits energy markets. For example, European benchmark\nnatural gas prices surged 30 per cent in early 2022\ndue to a cold winter, low gas inventories, and Russia\u2019s\nlimited supply to Europe. Colder weather has driven\nthe increased demand for heating. Also, Europe is\nsignificantly dependent on Russia, which supplies close\nto 40 per cent of the EU\u2019s natural gas and a third of\ncrude oil. The heavy supplies from Russia via two major\npipelines passing through Poland and Ukraine have\nbeen threatened by the border crisis between Russia and\nUkraine, resulting in cost-push inflation and shrunken\nhousehold budgets.\nThe EU\u2019s supply chain is also critically dependent\non China. The pandemic has led to disruptions in\nglobal supply chains. China has continued a zero-Covid policy leading to demand and logistics volatility\nduring the Chinese New Year. Europe lacks Capex in\nproduction and shipping capacities. Especially, metals\n(basic metals and fabricated metals) and automotive\nsectors (motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers, and\ntransport equipment) were hit the hardest due to a\n10 per cent drop in Chinese exports to the EU. Also,\nthe global trade of goods has been reduced by logistic\nbottlenecks caused by shipping congestions. To sum up,\nwith the volatility in trade flows, consumer spending on\ndurable goods and shortages of inventories repeated in\na vicious cycle, giving birth to high inflation.\nThe outbreak of the omicron variant of coronavirus\nhas weakened the labour market, causing possible\nwage increases in workforce sectors. The jump in\ninfection rates exacerbated consumer spending such as\ninternationaltravelbuttriggeredspendingforconsumer\ndurables. Overall, the consumer spending drop was far\nless than the first outbreak of coronavirus as people\nfeel less afraid of it due to its lower death rate and\nvaccinations. Furthermore, China\u2019s first Omicron cases\nwere reported last December. The new cases boosted\nthe zero-Covid strategy, engendering disruptions on\nthe EU\u2019s supply chain.\nMarket Signals For the Hawkish Movement\nThere are market movements that indicate the possible\nrates increase in the eurozone. In January 2022,\nGermany,France,andSpain\u2019sinflationratesexceeded\nexpectations at 5.7, 3.3, and 6.1 per cent respectively,\noppressing the dovish stance of the ECB. In addition,\nthe EU\u2019s unemployment rate hit a record low of 7 per\ncent last December signalling less supply of labour than\nthe demand for it. This can lead to rising wage inflation\nin tight labour markets.\nFurthermore, expectations of rates rise precipitated\nbond securities selling in the eurozone market. This\nis because the interest rates and the bond prices are in\nan inverse relationship. To illustrate, if current interest\nrates or bond yields were to rise, then the price of\npre-existing bonds will fall down to attract investors\nwho can potentially deposit their money to the banks\nwhich will enable them to offer higher rates of returns.\nGermany\u2019s 10-year government bond yield, which is\nthe benchmark of the currency bloc, rose to 0.313 per\ncent in February for the first time in three years. Also,\nGermany\u2019s 2-year borrowing costs steeply surged to\nminus 0.248 per cent in February, hitting a record high\nin six years. The increased bonds\u2019 yields reflected high\ninflation and expectations of the potential rise in the\nECB rates.\nFinishing Words\nJust a few weeks ago, the ECB president Christine\nLagarde emphasized that the EU economy would\nstabilize and the inflation would fall off before the end\nof this year. However, in early February, the head of the\nECB refused to rule out a potential interest rate rise\nthis year reversing their stance. If soaring inflation and\nsupply chain disruptions continue, the ECB is likely to\nturn to a hawkish stance this year.\nHye Oh is a writer for the Investment Society\u2019s Writers\u2019\nTeam.\nThe European Central Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt (pictured) is doing a lot of work recently.\nCredits: Bruno Neurath-Wilson // Unsplash\n\n"

Probably the most\nsignificant political event in a\ngeneration, with reasoning anywhere\nfrom intricacies about EU import\nrules disadvantaging the third world,\nall the way to brazen xenophobia and\nracism.51%ofBritsthinkthattoo\nmany immigrants have come\nto the UK over the past 10\nyears, according to YouGov,\ncompared with only 23%\nwho think immigration\nlevels have been \u201cabout\nright\u201d. Along side the\ninfamous NHS bus lie,\none of the major reasons cited\nfor Brexit was better control\nover our borders. How ironic,\nthen, is the state of immigration\nto the UK six years after the vote.\nIn November 2021 roughly 8000\npeople attempted to cross the English\nChannel from France, where they\u2019d\nlargely made it from war-torn areas\nsuch as Syria. This was a peak in a\nrecord-breaking year where a total of\n28,431peopleattemptedthecrossing,\nmorethanthreetimesthetotalnumber\nin 2020. While it\u2019s worth noting\nthat these numbers partly reflect the\nreduction in crossings via more covert\nmeans such as stowing away in HGVs,\nthe numbers do not exactly bode\nwell for \u201cnewly sovereign\u201d Britain.\nNow, obviously immigration\nwas perceived as a problem pre-Brexit, however media coverage\nand Channel crossing stats paint a\ngrim picture of how much worse the\nproblem has become. The icing on\nthe Brexiteer cake is that there is now\nno obligation for any other country\nto help share the load. Do you know\nwhich countries DO have allies who\nhave an obligation to share the load\nof immigrants? EU member states.\nThis irony occurs as a\nresult of our leaving the\nEUmeaningwehavealso\nleft something dubbed\nthe \u2018Dublin Convention\u2019.\nThe convention exists\namong EU states as\na method to rapidly\ndetermine which member\nstate has responsibility for the\nasylum application of an immigrant\nand to ensure the applicant is hosted\nin that country whilst the application\nis being processed. This means that\npre-Brexit, had a person made an\nasylum application in France and then\nattempted crossing the Channel, the\nUK authorities could easily return\nthis individual to France whilst\ntheir application was considered.\nFrance now has absolutely no\nobligation to take back anyone who\nattempts the crossing from Calais.\nA diplomatic source, speaking\nto The Times, said that talks had\nnot progressed since November,\nand disagreements centred around\n\u201cnimbyism\u201d (not in my back yard) and\nMacronkeepingthingscalmintherun\nup to the French elections in April.\n44 people died crossing the Channel\nlast year, but what\u2019s that compared\nto a smooth election run, right!?\nBrexit folly\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

    "content": "Throughout the year, we try to publish articles about the events and\nsports happening at Imperial. However, this week, nobody replied to our\nemails, so we\u2019ve decided to create our\nown article about\nsomething slightly\nmore generic and\noutside of Imperial: returning to\nsports after an inju-ry. The motivation\nto do this specific\ntopic comes from\na variety of rea-sons: watching the\nWinter Olympics\nand seeing some\nincredibly painful\ninjuries and surger-ies, the videos of\ngym fails circling\nInstagram when the weight gets a little\ntoo heavy (if you know, you know, and if\nyou don\u2019t know, you really don\u2019t want to\never find out), and because my back and\nknees have started playing up this week\nfor no apparent reason, I\u2019ve decided to\nuse this is a venting opportunity too.\nTo put it very bluntly: injuries suck.\nThere is no \u201coh look on the bright side\u201d\nor positive side to any injury, it\u2019s painful,\nits demoralising, and it feels completely\nunnecessary for your body to give up on\nyoulikethat.Sometimes,yougetinjured\ndue to something potentially stupid you\ndecidedtodo,maybelikeliftingaweight\nyou definitely knew you couldn\u2019t lift but\nyou didn\u2019t want people in the gym to\njudge you for taking the plates off, or for\nsomething that in all honestly shouldn\u2019t\nhave put you out for a week, like walking\nslightly funny on the curb and twisting\nyour ankle, or sitting\ndown funny and your\nknee gives out. Being\ninjured for any reason\nis incredibly difficult,\nbut being injured as an\nathlete can be incredibly\ntraumatising.\nYou might get injured\nin a game and need to\ntake a day or two out,\nlike when you get hit\nin the legs by a hockey\nstick and it leaves a big\nold nasty bruise, but you\nknow it\u2019ll look worse\nthanitis.Butsometimes,\nyou get injured, and your potentially out\nfor weeks, months, or even a few years,\nand that impacts you so much mentally\nand physically. When your identity is as\nan athlete, being taken out of the sport\nand activity you love to do most can be\nincredibly devastating.\nThe first few days, you\u2019re just in agony,\ndealing with the consequences of being\ninjured and barely being able to move.\nBut I think the worst part comes a few\nweeks after that, after you\u2019ve been told\nyou have to take however many weeks\nor months off, and you don\u2019t know what\nto do with yourself anymore. Or poten-tially, it\u2019s so devastating you might need\nsurgery, and with the current speed at\nwhich surgeries are happening, you\nmight be out for a few months to years\nwith recovery and all till you are back to\nyour normal self. And then what do you\ndo? How can you identify as an athlete\nwhen you are no longer able to do your\nsport? When you know you were on an\nupward ladder and you were progressing so well, doing the best you\u2019ve ever\ndone; how do you sit back and watch\nyourself slip away from who you are and\nknow that was your last chance, and you\nmissed it? And after weeks of recovery,\nhow do you go back knowing how much\nyou have to work at it just to be back to\nyour previous self, if that is even possible\nnow because your confidence is shot?\nIt\u2019ssoincrediblyhard,andIdon\u2019thave\nthe answers at all. I don\u2019t know what to\nsay or do to make anyone feel better\nabout having an injury, especially because it\u2019s so individual and personal. But\nwhat I can give you is something that I\nrealised might have helped me during it,\nand hopefully one of these things might\nresonate with you. The first thing I had\nto do was accept that I was injured, and\nthat everything I was feeling was completely valid. It\u2019s okay to feel sorry for\nyourself and to feel miserable, to complain all the time, and to feel completely lost for however long you need. And\nthen, the next thing you have to do, no\nmatter how hard it is, is to accept that it\nhas happened, and stop feeling sorry for\nyourself and start\nlooking at getting better. This\nI found to be\nthe hardest part,\nand don\u2019t get me\nwrong, every few\nmonths, I would\ncompletely crash\nand feel sorry\nfor myself and\ncry about how I\nhated the situation I was in and\nregret everything\nthat I did. But\nthat is okay, as long as you keep pushing through it and don\u2019t let it become\nyour entire personality. You don\u2019t want\nto be the person who had an injury and\nwas never seen again, you want to be the\nperson who had an injury and you got\nback into it, because it\u2019s something you\nlove. Looking back at all my injuries, I\nkeep telling myself that I regret the actions that led to my injury and I would\nhave done it differently, but in the end, I\nprobably would have done it exactly the\nsame again because there was no way for\nme to expect it to happen.\nThen the actual physical part comes\nin, where you have to work to recover.\nFrom a surgery, that means doing the\nphysiotherapy exercise your doctor gave\nyou that looks absolutely ridiculous to\nother people in public. It means taking\nit slow, and learning to listen to your\nbody and realize when the pain is helpful versus when the pain is detrimental.\nIt means taking it so incredibly slow you\nfeel like you\u2019ll never be where you were\nbefore, because if you take it too quickly,\nyou might never be able to go back at all.\nAnd I\u2019m not going to lie, seeing everyone progress around you, whether you\u2019re\nin an individual sport or a team sport,\nwhile you\u2019re not just not progressing but\nyou feel yourself regressing too, is so difficult mentally. So take the time off from\ntraining with your team, maybe take the\ntime off from talking to the people who\ndo sports with you. Perseverance goes a\nlong way.\nIn the grand scheme of things, you\u2019ll\nlook back at that time in your life when\nyou couldn\u2019t move, a year that felt it lasted a lifetime, and over time, it\u2019ll become\nasmallmemoryofthemanythingsyou\u2019ll\nachieve once you\u2019re back.

    "content": "This week, two Felix music editors graced O2\nBrixton ready to unleash scathing critiques on\nthe other guests of the night, BRIT-nominated indie\nroyalty, The Kooks.\nI\u2019ll put it plainly: I was not expecting to be thrilled.\nI saw The Kooks at Leeds Fest in 2019 and a mix\nof incessant drizzle, a packed field and a lacklustre\nperformance did not win me over. Conflictingly,\nanyone I spoke to who had seen the band at one of\ntheir own headline gigs raved about the energy and\nliveliness the band brought. After seeing them on the\nsecond night of their three-night run at O2 Brixton, I\nhave been converted into the devout energetic camp.\nThis was the best gig I\u2019ve seen at the venue. I\u2019ll admit\nthesamplesizeisnothuge(4) andthemathematicians\nwill not be convinced by my conclusion, but I stand by\nit; the Kooks are an incredible live band.\nAfter underestimating Storm Eunice (RIP O2\nArena), I made it to Brixton with minutes to spare\nafter navigating the confusing (to my Fulhaminhabiting self) bus routes of south London. The\nKooks began their set as I was queuing for a drink at\nthe bar, so this was quickly skipped for a spot closer\nto the stage. Navigating the crowd, it was easy to infer\nthe band were massive in the mid-2000s. The average\ndemographic of the crowd is 30-year-old couples\nwhere one is obviously more invested in the band\nthan the other. On the far end of this spectrum are\nthe 15-year-olds just going through their indie phase\n- as the original fans once were back in 2006. The set\nis loved by everyone though with the band mainly\nplaying hits from their first album.\nAfter kicking off their set with a campfire-side\na c o u s t i c\nsing-along to\n\"Seaside\", it is\nobvious the\ncrowd are all\ndevout fans\nof the band,\nso I feel\nslightly out\nof place in\nmy neutrality\nt o w a r d s\nthem \u2013 but\nthis is fast\nc ha n g i n g .\nGetting the\ncrowd jumping,\nthe whole band\njoin lead singer\nLuke Pritchard\nfor a raucous\nr e n d i t i o n\nof \"See The\nWorld\". Now,\nPritchard states\ntheir intent, a\nplaythrough of\nthe band\u2019s debut\nalbum Inside\nIn / Inside Out\nas a celebration\nof the 15-year\nanniversary of its release, fitting for an Inside In / Inside\nOut 15th\nAnniversary Tour.\nFiring through fan-favourites like \"Sofa Song\" and\n\"Eddie\u2019s Gun\", my personal favourite Kooks song\nis finally reached as the band play through their\nfirst album in genuine listening order - \"Ooh La\". It\nreminds me of secondary school. It reminds me of\ngoing to house parties in my hometown. I admit I\nhad a deep, deep Dark Fruits indie phase (minus any\nGallagher-esque raincoats though). The crowd has\nbeen building in excitement through the whole set and\nthis explodes as the first muddy notes of \"She Moves In\nHer Own Way\" echo through Brixton. I think it was\nthen that I realised this was one of the loudest crowds\nI\u2019d ever been in with shouts and screams applauding\nany action of the members of the band on stage.\nAfter seven continuous 'Inside In/Inside Out' tracks,\nThe Kooks finally reveal they have actually written\nother albums in the last 15 years, showing off hits like\n\"Bad Habit\" and \"Junk Of The Heart (Happy)\" while\nalso sprinkling in the remaining songs from the debut\nalbum that we were there to honour. By the time the\nband left the stage, everyone was sated. However, one\nmore thing remained if this was going to be a proper\ncommemoration, the band\u2019s biggest song \u2013 \"Na\u00efve\".\nReturning to chants for one more song, Pritchard\nbelted out a calming \"No Pressure\" before ending the\nnight with \"Na\u00efve\".\nI wandered out of the gig with a new view of The\nKooks,myexperienceatLeedsFest rewritten,andnow\nI would recommend to anyone to go see them if they\nget a chance, mainly down to the energy they bring to\ntheir sets and that the crowds belatedly reciprocate.\n19\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Tara Pal Chaudhuri\nJoe Riordan\nMusic\nDon\u2019t miss the gig -Battle of the Bands\nHeats @ Reynolds Bar,\n25th February\nThe long awaited\nImperial bands\ncompetition\nhosted by Live\nMusic Society is\ngoing to take place\nat Reynolds Bar.\nRemember to make it to the heats\nand support your favourite bands.\nTonight: Parc Firm, L.

    "content": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a\nmajor threat to health worldwide,\nclaiming over 1.2 million lives in\n2019 alone. According to a new study\npublished in The Lancet, AMR has\ncaused more deaths than either HIV/\nAIDS or malaria. This makes it one\nof the top 10 global threats facing\nhumanity, according to the World\nHealth Organization.\nWhat is antimicrobial\nresistance?\nAMR happens when microorganisms\n(such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and\nfungi) become resistant to treatments,\nmaking them unresponsive to medicine\nand thus making infections much harder to treat. Resistance to antimicrobials\n(antibiotics, antivirals, antiparasitics,\nand antifungals) renders these treatments ineffective against infection.\nOver time, this becomes increasingly dangerous as resistant\nmicroorganisms continue to\ngrow, increasing the risk of\nspread, severe disease, and\ndeath as certain illnesses\nbecome untreatable. Although this process occurs\nnaturally (microorganisms\nmutate naturally and are\nable to avoid being cleared\nby selective pressures such\nas antibiotics), it has been\nseverely sped up by the overuse of antibiotics in humans.\nOver-prescription and overuse of antibiotic drugs accelerate the development of\nresistance by exposing microorganisms\nto antibiotics (see diagram). Those that\nhave adapted will survive and continue\nto multiply, while those that have not\nadapted will die. The result is that the\nsurviving microorganisms contain resistance traits within their DNA, which\nmakes them resistant to certain antibi-otics. Furthermore, this resistance can\nbe spread to other microorganisms that\nhave not been exposed to antibiotics.\nWhen microorganisms\ncombine resistance to\nmultiple antibiotics,\nthey can become un-treatable. Microorganisms that have become\nresistant to most of the\ncommonly used medications are termed \u2018superbugs\u2019.\nA global analysis\nof antimicrobial\nresistance\nThe first comprehensive study analyzing the\nimpact of AMR worldwide has now been published in The Lancet, estimating that AMR-infections have led\nto 4.95 million deaths. Researchers have\nanalysed data on 471 million individuals across 204 countries, using statistical\nmodelling to estimate the effect of AMR\nacross the world.\nHere, they confirmed that AMR is\nnow a leading cause of death worldwide,\nwith the most deaths occurring in low-and middle-income countries. Despite\nthis, higher income countries were also\nshown to have dangerously high levels\nof AMR. Deaths directly attributable\nto AMR were estimated to be highest\nin western Sub-Saharan Africa (27\ndeaths per 100,000 people) and South\nAsia (22 per 100,000), and lowest in\nAustralasia (6.5 per 100,000). This\nstudy highlighted the varying impact\nof pathogens across the world. Whereas\nAMR in Sub-Saharan Africa was\nmostly caused by K. pneumonia (20%\nof deaths) or S. pneumoniae (16%), in\nhigher income countries it was primarily\nattributed to S. aureus (26%) or E. coli\n(23%).\nThe six leading pathogens associated\nwith AMR (Escherichia coli,\nfollowed by Staphylococcus aureus,\nKlebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus\npneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii,\nand Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were\nfound to be directly responsible for\n929,000deaths,andassociatedwith3.57\nmillion deaths in 2019. Notably,\none singly pathogen-drug\ncombination directly caused\nover 100,000 deaths in 2019\nalone \u2013 methicillin-resistance\nS. aureus (better known as\nMRSA, a superbug).\n\u201cThese new data reveal the\ntrue scale of antimicrobial\nresistance worldwide, and are\na clear signal that we must act\nnowtocombatthethreat,\u201dsaid\nco-author of the study Professor\nChris Murray, of the Institute for\nHealth Metrics and Evaluation at the\nUniversity of Washington.\n\u201cPrevious estimates had predicted\n10 million annual deaths from\nantimicrobial resistance by 2050, but we\nnow know for certain that we are already\nfar closer to that figure than we thought.\nWe need to leverage this data to course-correct action and drive innovation if\nwe want to stay ahead in the race against\nantimicrobial resistance.\u201d\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nLorena Mejias Martinez Science Writer\nEdited by: Jamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nThe burden of antibiotic resistance\nNew study finds that antibiotic resistance claimed over 1.2 million lives across the world in 2019 alone\nIllustration by Aim Kumpusiri, 1st Year Biotechnology\nTherearelargenumbersofbacteria\ninthebody,someofwhicharedrug\nresistant.\nEventually,antibioticsbecome\nlessandlesseffective.Transferof\nresistancetomultipleantibiotics\ngivesriseto\u2018superbugs\u2019.\nBacteriaarealsoabletotransfer\ntheirdrugresistancetoother\nbacteria.\nTheresistantbacteriasurviveand\nmultiplyunderbetterconditions,\nastheydonothavetocompetefor\nresourceswithotherbacteriain\nthebody.\nAntibioticswillkillthebacteria\npresent,boththegoodbacteriawhich\nprotectsthebodyfrominfectionand\ntheonecausingillness,butnotthose\nthatareresistanttothedrugs.\n1 2 3 4 5\nHow antibiotic resistance occurs...\nPhoto credit: Roberto Sorin, Unsplash Licence\n\n"

    "content": "Living through the\napocalypse \u2014a warning\nfrom the sky?\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nAfter weathering three storms it is\ntime to tally up the damages. At\nthe time of writing, three lives have been\nlost and 114,000 homes have faced disruptions to electricity and even water\nsupplies in the middle of winter. The\nMet Office has issued a red alert to warn\nof the severity of the expectant winds.\nNow, record-breaking winds of 122mph\nhave been reported and the strong gusts\nhave uprooted, broken and destroyed\nmillions of trees, vital carbon sinks for\nour planet. The storms have also resulted in major damage to many buildings,\nincluding the roof of London\u2019s beloved\nO2 arena, and disruptions along travel\nnetworks, including flooded roads at\nthe height of Storm Franklin.\nScientists agree that global warming\ncould worsen the outcomes from such\nclimatic events. As sea levels rise, coastal\nstorm surges can become more common\nand increase risks of flooding. Flooding\nrisks could be further worsened by\npredictions of elevated rainfall during\nthe winter season. Another major cause\nfor concern, according to the Center for\nClimate and Energy Solutions, is rising\nsea surface temperatures as a\nresult of Earth\u2019s warming climate.\nSurging sea\ns u r f a c e\ntemperatures may\nheighten wind speeds\nof storms, resulting in more damages\nto nature and property. Furthermore,\nrising temperatures have been linked to\nincreased precipitation from cyclones,\nproviding further basis for increased\nflooding risks.\nAre we prepared to mitigate these\nrisks?

Putin, who has\nroutinely been decried for attempting to re-write history, claimed the invasion\nwas being undertaken with the goal of \u201cdemilitarising\u201d and to \u201cde-nazify\u201d\nUkraine. In a speech immediately prior to the invasion, Putin claimed that\nUkraine was being run by Western \u201cpuppets\u201d and \u201cneo-nazis\u201d, neither of\nwhich are remotely true. He also said that if any country tried to stand in\nthe way of the invasion, \u201cRussia\u2019s response will be immediate and lead you to\nconsequences you have never encountered in your history\u201d. Reports of attacks\nfrom Russia and Belarus led to Ukraine defending itself on three fronts.\nRudy Giuliani will cooperate with capitol riot committee\nTrump\u2019s ex-lawyer has agreed to cooperate with the committee investigating the\ncapitol riot on the 6th January 2021, as long as he does not have to discuss his\ncommunications with Trump on the basis of attorney-client privilege concerns.\nGiuliani\u2019s cooperation marks a key moment in the investigation, folllowing\nmultipleotherRepublicanssayingthattheywillnotcooperatewiththecommittee.\nGiuliani could help determine the full extent of Trump\u2019s involvement in the\ninsurrection. The inquiry has been made even harder to carry out due to what\nPolitico describes as Trump\u2019s \u2018odd and enduring habit\u2019 of ripping up papers when\nhe\u2019s done with them. White House staff described Trump even clogging toilets\nwith the scraps of paper he\u2019d ripped. He also reportedly took 15 boxes of official\ndocuments with him when he left office, ignoring the Presidential Records Act.\nAbortion legalised\nColombia has legalised abortion during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy,\na historic ruling. A five to four victory in Colombia\u2019s constitutional court\nled to the improvement of abortion rights, where previously abortion was\nlegal only in cases of rape or incest. The ruling joins other recent victories\nsurrounding abortion rights in latin America; Mexico\u2019s supreme court\nruled against the prosection of women found to have ended their own\npregnancies, setting precedent across the country. Ecuador last week\nruled that women could access abortion in cases of rape, superceeding the\npreviousrulingthatallowedabortiononlywhenthemother\u2019slifewasatrisk.\nCommunication returned to Tonga after a month-long outage\nFive weeks after an underwater volcanic eruption smothered parts of\nTonga and cut off all telecommunications that did not use satellites,\nthe underwater cable that provides all reliable internet connections has\nbeen restored. The cable, which runs from Fiji, now provides internet\nto the main islands of Tonga, however some more remote islands still\nneed their connections restored. Tonga is made up of over 170 islands.\nUnlike the UK, which is provided for by around 60 such cables, Tonga\nhas only one, making its failure catastrophic for the island nation.\n... in this issue\u2019s year (1794)\nTHE UNITED STATES\nOne of the first successful cesarean sections is\ncarried out by Jesse Bennett\nCHINA\nThe White Lotus Rebellion begins\nFRANCE\nRobespierre establishes the \u2018Cult of the Supreme\nBeing\u2019 as the national religion in the new French\nrepublic\nSWEDEN\nCoffee is banned by royal decree\nFRANCE (again)\nLavoisier, who discovered oxygen\u2019s role in combustion,\namong other things, is guillotined.\nSOUTH AFRICA\nA slave ship is wrecked off the coast of South\nAfrica. 212 slaves lose their lives.\n\n"

The four\nare joined onstage by a fellow observer, Jack\u2019s mother,\ncolleagues at work, the Dean of Jack and Nicole\u2019s\nschool, and a crew of dedicated dancers, all of whom\nfilled the show with extra antics for our enjoyment.\nThe musical showcased a range of creative talents\noutside of the academic sector, particularly regarding\nthe musical numbers (dancing, singing, and orchestra).\nThe main cast did an outstanding job of acting as both\nthe younger and older versions of their characters, and\ntheir animation and emotion was admirable. While\nthe speech took a moment to find the perfect pace and\nthe mics were fuzzy at times, the script was delivered\nwith clarity and the songs revealed impressive vocal\nranges. The songs and dances were well-executed and\ngave us a glimpse of the contemporary hip-hop styles\nthat are becoming increasingly popular in Asia; filled\nout with ensemble dancers and a backing choir. A\nsmall but talented accompanying orchestra swept\nthe swift scene transitions along with fun melodies.\nThe dialogue was interspersed with jokes and\nmusical numbers poking fun at the pressures and\nstresses of university and working life.

    "content": "Human and nonhuman primates\nhave almost identical combinations of genes, yet we humans exhibit\nfar greater cognitive complexity. Scientists have for a long time sought to\nunderstand the basis for this but have\nremained unable to do so. Recently,\nhowever, a group of researchers in Israel have found that RNA editing plays a\nmajor role in developing higher brain\nfunction in humans compared to other\nprimates. This finding constitutes a paradigm shift, redirecting the focus of evolutionary biology from DNA to RNA.\nAn unexpected side effect of the coronavirus pandemic has been a ribonucleic acid (RNA) revolution. If we were to\nplay a word association game, \u201cRNA\u201d\nwould now likely invoke the response\n\u201cvaccine\u201d rather than a blank stare. The\nbreakthrough RNA vaccines have raised\nawareness of this biological molecule,\nwhich had not been a household name\nprior to the pandemic. There is more to\nribonucleic acid (RNA) \u2013 beyond its\npharmaceutical power \u2014 it was recently\nuncovered that RNA was a key agent in\nour evolutionary history.\nThe study, conducted by a research\nteam led by Dr Nurit Yaacov at the\nChaim Sheba Medical Center, provides\na new perspective on primate evolution.\nStraying from the mainstream glorification of DNA as the force of evolution,\nthe study puts RNA on the main stage.\nPreviously RNA was merely seen as an\nadaptor that served to communicate\nDNA\u2019s instructions to make proteins\nto the cell\u2019s protein-making machinery.\nYaacov\u2019s stance is that RNA is much\nmore complex than it is given credit for.\nThe phenomenon that he highlights is\nRNA editing. RNA is not the obedient\nmessenger it was once thought to be. It\nhas the ability to be rewritten before it\ndirects protein synthesis. Almost like a\ngame of Chinese whispers, where the information is passed along from DNA to\nRNA to proteins, the whispers warp the\ninformation. The outcome is the production of a new protein that may have\na different function in the cell. In other\nwords, RNA editing is a means by which\nthe cell escapes the shackles of its limited genes. More RNA transcripts and\nthus proteins can be produced than are\ncoded for in humans\u2019\nsurprisingly small genome of around twenty\nthousand protein coding genes.\nAlas, the once overlooked RNA is the key\nto resolving the paradox\nthat had left scientists\nstumped for decades -human and nonhuman\nprimates have almost\nidentical genomes, yet\nhumans show more developed behaviour. Evolution is tied to changes\nin DNA that result in\nnew and adapted pro-teins. This is why the\ngenetic material of individual species is often a\ndistinguishing feature.\nWe now know that it\nis possible that humans\nhave evolved higher developmental and\ncognitive complexity despite having\nnear identical genetic scripts to non-hu-man primates, because changes can occur at the RNA level rather than at the\nDNA level. RNA editing produces new\nproteins, while leaving the DNA un-changed.\nThis was confirmed by Dr Yaacov\u2019s\nstudy that compared the levels of editing\nin human and non-human primates, to\nascertain whether there is a relationship\nbetween RNA editing and the cognitive\ncapacity of organisms. To identify edit-ing, the composition of the gene\u2019s DNA\nandRNAmoleculeshadtobecompared.\nUsually, DNA acts as a template from\nwhich RNA is made, so they have nearly\nidentical composition. Therefore, differences between them are tell-tale signs of\nediting. The researchers compared RNA\nmolecules from different species, and\nfound greater levels of editing in humans\ncompared to monkeys and chimpanzees.\nThe molecules that were compared were\nextracted from the cerebellum, the part\nof the brain that accounts for half of\nthe brain\u2019s neurons. This region of the\nbrain is responsible for the maintenance\nof balance and posture, motor learning\nand cognitive functions. RNA editing\nresults in different variants of the same\nprotein with slightly different amino\nacid compositions and properties. Over\nthe evolutionary time scale these diverse\nprotein products could undergo natural\nselection, until proteins with fine-tuned\nfunctions emerge. What this suggests,\nthen, is that RNA editing is an agent by\nwhich natural selection can drive neural\nevolution and eventually higher cognitive function.\nIt seems that science is entering an\nRNA era, as we realize RNA\u2019s biological\nsignificance, from human evolution to\ntherapeutics. Science is turning the page\nfrom the DNA chapter that has been\nvigorously added to and edited by many\nscientists since the molecule\u2019s discovery in the 1860s. The most recent paragraphs of the RNA chapter have been\nwritten by BioNTech and Moderna, the\nbiotechnology companies that developed COVID-19 RNA vaccines.

DNA is a double-stranded molecule which is composed\nof the building blocks A, C, G, T. During transcription the strands are\nunzipped, and an exposed strand acts as a template for single-stranded\nRNA to be made. RNA is composed of building blocks A, C, G, U. The\ndifferencebetweenDNAandRNAisrevealedbytheirunabbreviatednames:\ndeoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid. DNA\u2019s sugar component has\none less oxygen than RNAs. Once RNA is made, it is translated into amino\nacids by the cell\u2019s protein making machinery. Enzymes known as ADARs\nhave one trick up their sleeve that effectively fools the translation machinery\ninto producing alternative proteins. ADARs modify the A building block\nto a resemble G. The incorporation of what the cell reads as a G leads to\ndifferent amino acids being strung together, changing the protein that is\nmade. This modification has a significant impact on the properties of the\nproteins produced, and the functions that they can carry out.\nEXPLAINER\nHOW ARE PROTEINS MADE?\nCredit: ANIRUDH, Unsplash Licence\n\n"

The city producing up to a third more\nmethane than previously thought\n\u201cIt\u2019s like being born again\u201d says Jimi Olghere, one of seven\npatients discovering their new world after undergoing\nrevolutionary sickle cell treatment\nInflammation caused by changes in vaginal bacteria could be associated\nwith miscarriage, according to researchers from Imperial\u2019s Department\nof Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction. Miscarriage occurs in\naround one in five pregnancies. Half of them are caused by chromosomal\nabnormalities in the embryo, but little is known about the causes of\nothers. The study included 167 pregnant people between 2014 and 2019,\n93 of whom had a miscarriage; in 54 of those cases, no chromosomal\nabnormalitieswereobservedintheembryo.Ahealthyvaginalmicrobiome\ncontains a lot of acid-producing Lactobacilli which can help prevent the\ngrowth of more harmful bacteria, such as Prevotella and Streptococcus,\nwhich were found to be more abundant in the vaginal microbiome of\nwomen who miscarried embryos with \u201cnormal\u201d chromosomes. Higher\nrates of inflammation was associated with these bacteria. More research is\nneeded to confirm the association, but the researchers working on a new\ntesttoanalysethevaginamicrobiomerapidly,whichcouldprovidefuture\nhelp for those at risk of miscarriage.\nResearchers have found that due to an accumulation of natural gas\ninfrastructure leaks, London is producing up to a third more methane\nthan previously thought. Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than\ncarbon dioxide, but it stays in the atmosphere for considerably less time.\nThe researchers used a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach of measuring methane by\nmeasuring the atmosphere directly rather than the typical \u201cbottomup\u201d approach of inferring methane emissions from the abundance of\nmethane-emitting processes. The identification of the source of this\nmethane is significant as it was previously thought London emitted\nmethane primarily via landfill. This opens up the potential for solutions.\nThe first patients from a new gene-editing treatment being trialed in\nthe US are finding its benefits. Sickle cell disease is caused by genetic\nmutation that leads to the body making haemoglobin that is rigid and\nunable to hold onto oxygen / navigate the body as well, causing it to get\nstuck and create blood blockages which increases patient\u2019s risk of heart\nattack, stroke and organ damage, and often causes them a great deal of\npain. Oxygen has a higher affinity for foetal haemoglobin, but the body\nswitches from producing foetal haemoglobin to adult haemoglobin just\nbefore birth. Foetal haemoglobin is unaffected by sickle cell disease. The\nswitch is controlled by the gene BCL 11A. Researchers were able to turn\nthe switch \u201coff\u201d so the boy would produce foetal haemoglobin again. The\ntrial involved killing all of the stem cells that create adult haemoglobin\nvia chemotherapy, and blood transfusion with the genetically engineered\nstem cells. 45 patients have had this treatment, but the first 7 have already\nexperienced amazing results, with none of them requiring admission to\nhospital or doctor\u2019s visits because of sickle cell related complications.\nFROM AROUND THE WORLD...\nFROM IMPERIAL\nPeterAdesinaisafinal-yearPhD\nstudent in the Geotechnics\nresearch group in the Department\nof Civil Engineering.

Recent studies on sharks\u2019 immune\nsystem and genome show potential in\ndeveloping novel antivirals \u2013 we don\u2019t\nwant these to die alongside these majestic creatures.\nSharks are certainly one of the most\nfascinating creatures to have ever exist-ed. They have been living on Earth for\naround 450 million years, since before\nthedinosaurs.Nowtheseimpressiveani-malsareindangerduetothedestruction\nof their habitats and overfishing. Not\nonly do sharks play an important role in\nbalancing marine populations, but their\nancient immune system can help us to\ndevelop novel antivirals and more.\nThe book Sharks Don\u2019t Get Cancer,\npublished in 1992 by William Lane,\nclaims that consuming shark cartilages\ncan cure cancer of affected patients. This\nargumentarosebecausetheskeletonand\nsome body parts like the fins are made of\ncartilage. This type of tissue does not\nhave blood vessels due to chemical compounds that inhibit their formation.\nThis is key because cancerous cells can\nform new blood vessels which connect\nwith the main bloodstream to feed on\nits nutrients and oxygen, growing bigger\nand stronger. Many companies in Western countries started selling nutritional\nsupplements with shark cartilages at\nvery high prices and some patients with\ncancer even quit conventional cancer\ntreatments to exclusively rely on shark\ncartilages.\nIn parts of China, Taiwan and Southeast Asia, shark fins have been considered a delicacy affordable for the privi-legedclassforcenturies.Emperorsdrank\nshark fin soups frequently in attempts to\nextend their lifespans. Currently, with\nthe growth of the middle class in China, more and more people can afford\nthe valuable shark fins, causing demand\nto skyrocket, and leading to the fishing\nof more sharks than ever before. Unfortunately for these people, scientific research shows that consuming shark meat\nis not beneficial, but indeed prejudicial\nfor the health. Shark meat contains high\nconcentrations of mercury, a toxic met-al, and most of its proteins are too big\nfor our intestine to absorb properly. Additionally, sharks do get cancer. Some\nspecimens of white sharks with visible\ntumours have been observed in the wild.\nOverfishing is putting sharks on the\nbrink of extinction. Estimates indicate\nthat 100 million sharks are killed annu-ally. Around one-sixth of shark species\nare in danger of extinction. The disappearance of sharks from marine ecosystems would be catastrophic. These\nmajestic animals act as a regulator of\nfish populations, preventing population overgrowth and guaranteeing a fair\ndistribution of resources among them.\nSharks also prevent the spread of diseases by eating first the weak and ill fish as\nthese are easier to hunt. CO2\nincreases\nthe acidity of the water, which is noxious\nfor corals. It has been proven that coral\nreefs rich with many sharks are much\nhealthier and with greater biodiversi-ty. The reason is that sharks reduce the\nnumber of small organisms, which emit\nmost of the CO2\nfound in the water due\nto their abundance and high metabolic\nrate. In a nutshell, by killing sharks, we\nare damaging our oceans and futher-more, ourselves.\nScientists sequenced the entire genome of the Great white shark in 2019,\nwhich can be extrapolated to sharks in\ngeneral. It has revealed that the genome\nofthegreatwhiteis1.5timesbiggerthan\nthe human one and is extremely unsta-ble. This could cause harmful mutations\nthat lead to cancer, but the research has\nalso found that the great white accounts\nfor this with a sophisticated gene repairing machine more advanced than the\nhuman one. Scientists have also found\nsome unique genes that may boost the\nimmune system of sharks that could\nexplain their incredible wound healing and viral resistance characteristics,\nalthough more research is required. A\ndeep understanding of the genome and\nimmunology of sharks might allow us to\ndevelop novel therapies in a broad realm\nof diseases.\nHowever, this is not the first time that\nstudying sharks has provided such re-sults. Back in 1993, Dr Michael Zasloff\ndiscoveredsqualamineindogfishsharks.\nSqualamine is a broad-spectrum antiviral because it does not target viruses. Instead, squalamine binds to the cell membrane and blocks viral proteins from\nattaching to the cell, so that viruses cannot enter and infect the cell. Dr Zasloff\nnoticed that no other chemical in nature\nhas similar properties. Additionally,\nsqualamineinhibitsbloodvesselsforma-tion.Thispropertypromptedthelaunch\nof research to study the potential application of squalamine to treat cancer. It is\nimportant to clarify that no sharks need\nto be killed to harvest squalamine. This\nchemical compound is synthesised artificially from soybean steroids.\nSharks are essential for the health of\nour oceans, but we are wiping them out\non the basis of false pseudo-scientif-ic claims and traditional superstitions.\nMeanwhile, we are not giving enough\nattention to the good that sharks could\ndo to find new drugs to cure serious dis-eases.\nA great white shark\nPhoto credit: Terry Gross, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.5\nShark soup, a delicacy in some parts of East and Southeast Asia\nPhoto credit: Andrew Fung, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0\n\n"

    "content": "What is art? \u2026 I know, I know,\neveryone, their secondary school\nart teacher, and the post-industrial\nwalls of the Tate Modern have heard\nthat one before, but hear me out. Can\neveryday objects be art? Can a pile of\nsweets represent a portrait? Can you\ntake away from an artwork to reveal\nmore about it? I hear you shaking your\nheads indignantly, however I want to\nexplore these questions by celebrating a contemporary LGBT artist\u2014\naptly named F\u00e9lix Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres.\nGonz\u00e1lez-Torres was an openly gay\nconceptual minimalist artist from Cuba,\nborn in 1957. After graduating from\nart school in Puerto Rico, he moved to\nNew York City in 1979 and continued\nto learn and produce there, as well as\nthroughout Europe, until his untimely death at the age of 38 due to health\ncomplications from AIDS. His lover,\nRoss, who died five years prior (also due\nto AIDS), influenced many of his installation pieces. Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres also\nbelonged to an innovative group called\n\u2018Group Material\u2019 whose aims were social\nand cultural activism through the medium of conceptual art. Conversely to the\ninflammatory, overtly sexual, anti-cen-sorship works of many queer artists of\nthe late 1980s and early 1990s\u2019 \u2018culture\nwars\u2019,Gonz\u00e1lez-Torresaimedtomitigate\ncontroversy and bypass censorship with\nhis commonplace mediums.\nConceptual art refers to art that values the ideas it conveys over the visual\nor aesthetic representation of a subject,\nor the materials used to produce it.\nGonz\u00e1lez-Torres characteristically used\neveryday objects such as lightbulbs, bat-tery-powered clocks, candles, and sweets\nto convey personal, social, and political\nconcepts. Similar to the now infamous\nComedian (which were three identical\ncertificates of authenticity for the installation of a banana duct taped to a\nwall, with one selling for a staggering\n$150,000 USD), his work was not created for its intrinsic material value or ir-reproducibility. This meant that it could\nbe reconstructed in galleries by purchase\nof his specific instructions, outlined in\nhis \u2018contracts\u2019. His art, however, has an\narguably deeper meaning, which I will\nexamine by showcasing one of his most\nfamous works.\nGonz\u00e1lez-Torres\u2019 most recognisable\ninstallations are his \u2018candy spills\u2019. Employing mounds of shiny, individually\nwrapped sweets, as per his instructions,\nwhich would be weighed and placed in\nthe corners, under inconspicuous walls,\nor directly in the centre of gallery spac-es. Visitors would be encouraged to\ntake a candy and do what they like with\nit. The piles diminished in volume and\nmass, but although they did so, curators\nwould constantly replenish the heaps,\nthus keeping them in a perpetual state of\nplenty.\n\u201cUntitled\u201d (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)\n(1991), is a particularly tragic piece, as it\ndirectly references his partner Ross and\nhis experience of dying of AIDS-related\ncomplications. Its 79 kilograms of \u201ccandies in various colo[u]red wrappers\u201d\u2014\nequal to Ross\u2019 ideal body mass\u2014were\npiled up in the corner of a room. As each\nviewer took a sweet, the mass decreased,\nrepresenting Ross\u2019 rapid weight loss in\nhis final years of suffering. Yet by replenishing the stock, his memory is seen to\nbe perpetually reincar-natedthroughtheexhib-it. Additionally, I think\nit is a statement of activ-ism. Left discarded in a\ncorner, whilst also being\nexhibited to the public\neye by its context in an\nart gallery, draws ties to\nthe propagation of information about the HIV\nEpidemic of the \u201880s.\nThe disease was covered\nmajorly in the media of the time, yet relatively little was done to help and support those suffering from it. As if they\nwere swept into a corner of a brightly\nlit room and slowly left to die of neglect\nin front of everyone. Others have likened the piece to a compound allegory\nof HIV and its transmission. Everyone\nthat came into \u2018oral\u2019 contact with Ross\nby eating a candy could easily become\n\u2018infected\u2019 by the chocolate, the sugar of\nwhich goes straight into the consumer\u2019s\nbloodstream. Furthermore, as a medical\nstudent, I cannot help but see each individually wrapped sweet as an analogy\nof an HIV virion; the wrapper representing its membrane, and the sweet its\ncapsid and RNA insides. The visitors,\non the other hand, act as T lymphocyte\nimmune cells tricked into engulfing the\nvirus because of its inconspicuous \u2018wrapper\u2019. The constant replenishment of the\nsweets, a comparison to HIV\u2019s replication in the body and recurrent viral load\nin those untreated at the time.\nThe plastic within which the candies\nhave been wrapped is also significant.\nIt reminds many, who saw the works at\nthe time, of the masses of \u2018plastics\u2019 (con-doms) given out \u2018like candy\u2019 throughout the gay community in Los Angeles.\nOthers have said that the act of eating\nsuch a compartmentalised confection-ary off a gallery floor (which one would\nnot normally do) bears witness to the\nstigma against HIV-positive individu-als. Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres is basically asking\nus: You wouldn\u2019t eat unwrapped candy off the\nfloor? Even today, the\nnotions of \u2018clean\u2019 and\n\u2018dirty\u2019 affect those who\nare HIV-positive. The\ncolours of the wrappers\nare also relevant. In other works, such as \u201cUntitled\u201d (USA Today) he\nuses red, white, and blue\nwrappers to symbolise\nthe USA, whereas, in\n\u201cUntitled\u201d (Portrait of Ross in L.A.) they\nwere multicoloured. I see this as a direct\nreference to the rainbow Pride flag and\npossibly a comparison to the diversity of\nthe LGBTQ+ community.\nMass production and cultural heritage play a role in this piece also.\nGonz\u00e1lez-Torres actively wanted to\navoid the American stereotype of South\nAmerican art as vibrant, busy, and colourful by using simple, usually mono-chromatic, mundane objects. The plastic material, uniformity of form, and\n\u2018ready-made\u2019 replicability of the sweets\ncomments on the rise of modern con-sumerism. In his instructional contracts,\nhe would outline how the installation\u2019s\nmediumwasan\u201cendlesssupply\u201d,justlike\nthe ubiquitous production of identical\ngoods found in every corner of the USA.\nFinally, I would like to end with a\nquote from an interview in 1995, in\nwhich Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres says the following regarding his work being featured\nin an exhibition at the Guggenheim in\nNew York City: \u201cI\u2019m gay. But I don\u2019t\nmake work about being gay \u2026 [I] just\ninclude it \u2026 [I make the work about\nbeing] In love with a man \u2026 it\u2019s very\npolitical. Because you are going against\nthe grain of what you are supposed to\nbe doing. You are not supposed to be in\nlove with another man, to have sex with\nanother man. \u2026 [My art] is sentimental,\nbut it\u2019s also about infiltration. It\u2019s beauti-ful; people get into it. But then, the title\nor something, if you look really closely\nat the work, gives out that it\u2019s something\nelse.\u201d In my opinion, this demonstrates\nhis desire to circumvent the anti-gay\nnarrative and divulge his art to a wider\naudience, whilst leaving hints for those\neagle-eyed LGBT-few. So, now over to\nyou. Next time you see a pile of sweets\nspilling out of a bag, or a pile of haphazardly placed everyday objects, think\nabout what they could symbolise. Or\nthink of what ordinary things you could\nuse to convey a deep meaning of something important to you.\nF\u00e9lix Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres:\nConceptualising the HIV Epidemic\nGonz\u00e1lez-Torres created visual art using commonplace objects such that his work appeared simplistic on the surface, but he often touched upon his personal life and the widely ignored emotional toll of the HIV epidemic on the LGBTQ+ community in the 80s.\n5thYearMedic\nAlexanderConway\nFRIDAY 25TH JANUARY 2022\n23\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nComment\nUntitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)\nPhoto credits: Ken Lund on Wikimedia Commons\nPhoto credits: Stavrialena Gontzou on Unsplash\nLGBTQ+ HISTORY MONTH\nThe first UK Pride parade was held on\nSaturday 1st July 1972. 2022 will mark the\n50th Anniversary of Pride UK\n\n"

This time it\u2019s an easier decision for who got\nto write about\nthe experience\nthough because only one\nof us can actually remember\nenough about\nthe night to\nput any words\non the page.\nIf you want to\ncheck out Rosie\u2019s thoughts on\nWolf Alice, you\ncanfindthemin\n\u2018A Love Letter\nTo Wolf Alice\u2019 on Felix Online. Now for my thoughts.\nI\u2019ll summarise already. This gig had everything; it\nwas amazing. Support was provided by Matt Maltese,\nwho I didn\u2019t realise was the singer of \"As The World\nCaves In\" \u2013 a song I\u2019ve heard so many times on TikTok.\nThis was a surprisingly calm start to the night with\nMaltese himself sitting behind a keyboard, and the\nrest of the band standing around in a circle making for\na very intimate set.\nIn a completely opposing set, Wolf Alice themselves\ncame on stage and immediately embarked on a venue-filling rendition of \"Smile\". The whole band exudes\nconfidence, they\u2019re seasoned performers who are\nabsolutely in love with what they are doing. From the\nbeginning of the set and throughout I was entranced\nby guitarist Joff Oddie\u2019s playing. Looking suave in a\nsuit, Oddie exhibited sounds that he'd perfected for\neach song.\nA special mention has to go out to the lighting.\nUsually at a gig the lighting is nice and makes the songs\nslightly more interesting with the odd strobe effect but\ntoday it was noticeable, elegant, a thing of beauty. I\nwish I could put in a photo during every song of the set\nbut I\u2019ll have to pick my top 3: green spotlights scanned\nthrough the crowd as an alarm went off all before the\nband erupted into the manic \"Play The Greatest Hits\";\na white spotlight shining from the front of the stage\nsilhouetted the band as they played a breakdown; a\nsimilar spotlight shone on lead singer Ellie Rowsell\nas she sang\n\"Safe From\nH e a r t b r e a k \",\ncreating a regal\nshadow on the\nback curtain as if\nshe were a Disney\nprincess.\nIn their encore,\nthe band had a\nstaggered entry\nback onto the\nstage as Rowsell\ngave an ethereal\nperformance of\n\"The Last Man\nOn Earth\". This is my favourite Wolf Alice song and\nreminds me of my first summer living in London last\nyear. After this emotional track, the band were all back\nto play fan-favourite and their biggest song, \"Don\u2019t\nDelete The Kisses\" to the delight of the crowd. Off the\nback of winning the Best Group award at the BRITs\nthis year, Wolf Alice continue to prove they are worthy\nof the accolade.\nWolf Alice Play Their Greatest Hits\nWritten by Joe Riordan Music Editor\nWolf Alice (photo: Joe Riordan)\nThe band round off their three-night run at Hammersmith Apollo\nIfeel bad that up until a few weeks ago, I hadn\u2019t given\nCate Le Bon her time in my headphones\u2019 limelight.\nI\u2019d read multiple reviews of 'Reward', her previous effort before her newest album Pompeii, which hailed\nher as an innovative songwriter, blender of moods and\ngenres, and I made a mental note to listen to her along\nwith the many, many other new artists that I wanted to\nget through after deciding I wasn\u2019t just going to listen\nto Radiohead all the time for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, she fell by the wayside, and only when I\nsaw that her newest album was released did I come to\nappreciate what she had to offer.\nRight now, though, I\u2019m sitting awake at 1 AM\non a Monday night trying to put into words exactly\nwhat makes this album review-worthy for me. I\nstarted writing for Felix with the original intent to\ntalk about albums old and new which really affected\nme emotionally, which was why I opened with Mark\nHollisbackatthestartoftheyear.Thisoneisdifferent,\nthough. It\u2019s been out for around three weeks now, and\nit\u2019s basically all I\u2019ve been listening to because it\u2019s just\u2026\nreally good. Black Country, New Road released an\nalbumbasicallyatthesametimeandI\u2019veleftitfordead.\nIlikethisonemore.MaybeI\u2019llgivethemtheirduelater,\nbut Le Bon is overdue\nat the moment.\n'Pompeii' has been\ncalled her \u201cpoppiest\u201d\nalbum to date, and it\u2019s\nnot hard to see why.\nIn the various singles\nreleased, the groove\nand guitar carry her\nsinging; the melody seems predictable enough, but the\npoetryinherwordsisanotherlevelofwordsmithythat\none wouldn\u2019t quite expect from current pop artists.\n\u201cI get by pushing poets aside cause they can\u2019t beat\nthe Mother of Pearl,\u201d she explains on \"Moderation\",\nperhaps the album\u2019s catchiest single. She invites us to\n\u201cPicture the party where you\u2019re standing on a modern\nage,\u201d which is a reference to an essay by Lina Bo Bardi\nchastising Man\u2019s attempt at a moon landing when so\nmany still live in poverty.\nA lot of the songs in the album carry a similar air\nof strangeness. Whether it\u2019s in Le Bon\u2019s vocals or the\nwarbling synths or saxophones that accompany her,\nit\u2019s always there \u2013 only 40 seconds into the title track,\nthe vibe changes suddenly. \u201cGet dressed, you\u2019re a mess,\nyou\u2019re a sight, did you dream about Pompeii?\u201d Le\nBon has said the song is a commentary on the ruins\nthemselves\u2013asapreservationofhumansuffering,how\nforthefirsttimeinsolongthey\u2019vebeendesertedduring\nthe pandemic, and how capitalism has commodified\nthem. \u201cAll my life in sentiment / all my language is\nvulgar and true.\u201d The nature of what Le Bon is talking\nabout is in itself absurd here, and as a result, her ideas\nare clear and concise.\nThe musical climax comes with the single\n\"Remembering Me\" followed by the contemplative\n\"Wheel\" \u2013 songs that couldn\u2019t be more different in\nthe context of this album. In the former, Le Bon talks\naboutthe\u201cRemakeofmylife,\u201demphasisingtheneedto\nlive in the present, not dwelling on previous mistakes.\nThe song is lively, groovy, contrasting the melancholy\nin the words Le Bon sings. On \"Wheel\", there\u2019s\nreminiscing, contemplating, and the song is slow, as if\nto give her some room \u2013 in the same way that Le Bon\nlikes to escape to the likes of the Lake District to write\nand compose. \u201cNo prisoner, no peace.\u201d she chants\non the way out, ending this marvellous collection of\ndreamlike songs in style.\nWolf Alice (photo: Joe Riordan)\nA Very Bon Album Indeed: 'Pompeii' by Cate Le Bon\nWritten by Benjamin Bateman Music Writer\nThe Welsh songwriter made an album which completely stole my attention from BCNR \u2013 don't tell Rosie\nAlbum Reviews\n\n"

However, a NegaFelix\nundercover investigation has revealed\nthat many of the industry\u2019s leaders\nhave been responsible for puppeteering\nautocrats into a number of different\ntheatres of war.\nA whistleblower, speaking on the\ncondition of anonymity, told NegaFelix\n\u201cThe economics of the situation are simple.\nThe more contested countries there are,\nthe more flags are needed to be burnt, or\nchanged or replaced or torn down.

She is thought to have\nbeen pivotal in providing money for such\ndisparate operations as voter intimidation\nin Sussex County Cricket Club elections\nin 2018 and fomenting anti-Western\nsentiment in the Middle East in order to\nincrease their sales of Star and Stripes\nflags in that region.\nThe whereabouts of Hang are currently\nunknown, but she tops a number of\ninternational wanted lists and a $5 million\naward has been posted for information\nthat leads to her arrest.\nVexillum magnates behind republic\ndeclarations for Luhansk and Donetsk\nCATNIP\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n16 Felixonline.co.uk\nThis week\u2019s rejected headlines...\nCFO resigns, however\nreasoning remains Muirky\nCFO\u2019s career Muirdered\nCollege pays Muirage to \u201crebuild trust\u201d\nI can see clearly now the\nMuir has gone Muirine behaviour\nleads CFO to resign\nLast helicopter out of Sanderson\nOne Muir reason for\nGast to leave\nDing dong the Muir is gone\nThe Sandersons of time\nhave run out for Muir\nDalum \u201cDizzy\u201d Crysdale NegaFelix Reporter\nWe realise this piece may be perceived as a little close to the bone given current events.\nFelix stands vehemently against the actions of Russia and does not mean to make\nlight of the situation unfurling in Ukraine\n\n"
