He outlined the situation regarding South\nAfrica, how it had made military intervention in many southern\nAfrican states, how it had been condemned at the United Nations, and\nhow it practiced a crude form of racism which divides on the basis of\nrace and language.\nFor ten years it had been speculated that South Africa was looking\nfor the ultimate weapon. Events have suggested that South Africa now\nhas such a weapon and would be prepared to use it. This suggestion is\nnot just the exaggerated polemics of the Anti-apartheid Movement, as\nSouth Africa is an abnormal society where many people are Nazi sympathisers.\nSouth Africa has its own uranium mines and has a lair amount of\ntechnology for creating nuclear fuel. However it still needs more\nspecialists and technology. To that end it takes advantage of courses\nsuch as the one at IC. South Africa should be denied this opportunity.\nIC should reconsider its position as the risk that it is wrong cannot be\nafforded.\nMr Smith, outlining the College position, said that students were\nadmitted on grounds of academic merit only. IC only functions as a corporate body within its own sphere of competence, academic\nmatters. Once it went beyond this it would be open to pressure from all\nquarters. It should be the British Government's decision if students\nwere not to be allowed into the country to study.\nThe College does not inquire too deeply into each student's financial\nbacking as this would be an invasion of privacy of the individual. The current sponsorship arrangements do have loopholes but IC would be\ngoing back on its basic principles if it started allowing special eases.\nAlter many spirited interventions from the audience ol nearly forty\npeople, Mike 'Ferry summed up, arguing that IC should be ahead of\nother colleges in this matter.\nThe motion was passed by a large majority.\nFewer overseas students\nin Britain\nAPPLICATIONS FROM overseas students for British Universityplaces are thirty-live percent down compared to last year. The Universities Central Council on Admissions ( UCC A) figures, released\nin April, show that 13,292 foreign students have applied for a place\nnext October. Last year the figure was 20,528. Of the 7,236 reduction,\nmore than 5,500 were men.\nThe drop is rel lee ted in IC student numbers. The number of\napplications for 1981/2 is not yet available, but 1980/T figures show a reduction from 994 overseas students to 771. of which undergraduate\nnumbers are down ten percent, research students down twenty-live per\ncent and advanced courses thirty-five per cent down.\nThis shortfall follows the enormous increases in overseas students'\nlees in recent years. However despite the fears and warnings from\nstudent unions, lecturers and the Committee of Vice-Chancellors.\nCVC P, the Government has continued the full-cost fees policy. As\nwidely predicted, this policy has now led to not only a loss of revenue\nbut also damage to overseas relations. At the Association of\nCommonwealth Universities meeting in HongKong last month,\nBritain's decision to charge EEC students the same tuition fee as home\nstudents brought a furious response.\nUCC A figures also show a four per cent increase in home student\napplication, which gives an overall one per cent reduction.\nSmall Ads\n\u2022Yamaha RO200, T reg, only 2,700\nmiles, front disk brake, rack and top box.

Thanks to\nDave, Martin, Patrick, Steve, Colin, Tim, Phil,\nIan and Maz.\nmmm mI know of a lecturer in social sciences who,\nwhen he has an excess of marking to do, will\nstand at the top of a flight of stairs and fling\nan armful of essays towards the bottom.\nThose which actually reach the bottom are\npresumed heavier, therefore longer, therefore\nmore thorough; he awards each of these aB. Those which land on the stairs are given aC,D or E according to how far they travel.\nAt Primelia College (that bastion of\ntechnology recently s at iris ed in the New\nScientist) the logic professor has an equally\nbizarre system of marking for the annual\nessay he sets on 'The Relevence of Logic to\nMushroom Farming in the Outer Hebrides.'\nTo start with, he rejects most (but never all) of\nthe hundred-odd essays as being too awful to\nmerit a mark at all. He then gives each of the\nremaining papers a mark from zero to ten.\nThis may not seem so bizarre, until I tell\nyou that the professor makes sure that the\nfirst paper he marks is given the same number\nof points as the number of papers he gives\nzero to. (Got that?) Likewise, the second\npaper he marks gets the same number of\npoints as the number of papers he gives one\npoint to. And the third paper gets the same\nnumber of points as the number of papers\nwhich get just two points, and so on, right to\nthe bottom of the pile of papers.\nNaturally it would offend the professor's pride in the elegance of his scheme if he ever\ngraded a pile of papers with the same marks\nhe had used before. How many years can the\nprofessor's marking scheme last before he is\nforced to repeat himself?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me c/o FELIX Office, please. There will be a prize of\n\u00a35 (donated by Mend-a Bike) and two tickets\nto the I.C. Orchestra concert next Friday for\nthe correct solution randomly selected at\n1:00pm next Wednesday.\nLast Week's Solution 14 Houses.\nHonours List\nFour people did all the Easter puzzles: Neili\nCooper, Atmospheric Physics PG, Roland\nMarslin, Physics 3, Richard Tate, DoC RA,\nind Martin Taylor, DoC PG. Of these, Richard\nTate was randomly selected as the winner,\nand he gets a \u00a310 voucher, redeemable at\nMend-a Bike, and \u00a32 cash. In addition,\nRichard won the individual prize for 'Chess of\nDraws' which carries another \u00a32. Neill won\nthe \u00a32 prize for 'Piayfair Square', and Roland\nwon JAIT's Crossnumber. 'Eggheads' was\nwon by Simon Nuttall, Physics 1. And last\nweek's prize goes to CC Pantelides. Cheques\nwill be available in the FELIX Office on\nMonday afternoon. Congratulations to all the\nprize winners, and everyone else who entered.\nOther News\nMany of my solvers are fed up with 'musical'\npuzzles, and I'm certainly getting fed up with\nsetting them. So although this week's puzzle\nisn't based on a musical theme, do please\nnote that IC Orchestra have given two free\ntickets as a bonus prize to plug their concert\nnext Friday. And do go to the concert; if they\nget a full house, we may not have to suffer\nposters of such a nauseous hue around\ncollege in future.\nIs anyone prepared to help with my\ntakeover bid for the back page next week?\nSteve's editorials are getting scrawnier every\nweek.\nAnd so to the solutions of the Easter\npuzzles...\nPlayfalr Square WATCH SPRING Chess of Draws\nThe original position was as shown in the diagram. Blanche expected the machine to castle, allowing\n2. QR7 mate. Instead the machine played the\n(rather more sound) moveR X Q which Blanche followed with 2. K X R.As Grey Spider points out, the interesting thing\nabout this puzzle is not that the solution is difficult\nto find, north at it is particularly elegant or ingenious, but that it is unique.\nApologies for the title ot this puzzle. Steve told me it was witty, and at 6:30amI believed him. Eggheads\n49. Although this puzzle is nowhere near as difficult\nas many people made it out to be, explaining the\nsolution in full would be unnecessarily tedious. So I shall outline the basic ideas, and if you're not\nsatisfied with that, write.\nAs I walk down the corridor the lecturers' disciplines( pure or applied) must rotate in cycles of\nsix . . . PPP AAA PPP... The problem is to find where\nthis sequence is broken at the two ends of the\ncorridor, bearing in mind that the first manI questioned must have given a consistent answer\nabout the man at the opposite end. Now. investigate all six possibilities for the disciplines of the last three men I questioned. If all\nthree are of the same discipline( PPP or AAA) then\nthe first man's answer can only be consistent if the\nnumber of lecturers is of the form 6n,6n+1 or\n6n+2. If two of the three are of one discipline, and the third is of the other, then if the odd one has an office at the end of the corridor, the total number of\nlecturers is 6n,6 n1or6n2, and if the odd one has\nan office two from the end, the number must be 6n,6n+1 or 6 n1.( The odd one cannot have an office\none from the end of the corridor, because this would violate the 'cycle of six' rule.)\nNow the only possibilities for the total number are\n49, 56, 63, 70 and77.63 is of the form 6 n+3 and so is impossible. So the\nlecturer who said '63' is applied.56 is of the form 6 n+2 which is only possible if all\nof the last three lecturers are of the same discipline.\nSo we eliminate 56\nNow if the third man lied, there are 70 (=6n2) or\n77 (=6n1) lecturers in total. But this means there\nmust be at least one truth-teller among the final\nthree, which contradicts our assumption he lied.\nThus he told the truth, and there are 49 lecturers.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB.(5895!1I ext. 1048/int. 2881) Copyright FELIX 1981.

Namely that no matter what\ngovernment is in office there is for the\noverwhelming mass of people the idea that one\nmust put our country before any narrow\nideological considerations. This is evinced by the\nfact that there never has been in this country any\nofficial nationalistic doctrine; we do not have to\ntell ourselves, unlike the Germans or the Poles,\nhow much we love our country. We do, and\ntherefore there is no need to stridently tell the\nworld that we do.\nThis is the reason why the political ideologies\nwhich have dominated the thought of this century\nhave not made any noticeable impression on our\ncountry. The National Union of Fascists, and its\nsuccessor the National Front did not and have\nnot gained any popular influence. Similarly we\nhave the smallest Communist Party in Western\nEurope.\nSince all these parties are extreme it became\nobvious to ideo logue s on both sides that they\ncould not si eze power in this country by using\nthese parties. Their solution therefore has been in\nthe past couple of decades to gain control of the\ntwo main political parties in this country. By doing\nthis their views received the respectability of\ntradition. More importantly since politics is not a closely followed spectator sport in this country,\npeople will, out of habit, continue to vote for the\ntraditional parties without perceiving that they are\nbringing ruin upon this country.\nThus the Labour Party has moved to the left\nand is now in the hands of the left. The\nConservative Party has moved to the right and is\nnow in their hands. There is no sight more\nfrightening than being at a political meeting of\neither party where a person is expressing a moderate view and is howled at by the \"purists\"\nof that party for being an enemy of the party. This\nkind of attitude can only logically lead to a McCarthy era in America or a Stalinist era in\nRussia. Once one gets on the slide of intolerance,\nviolence, arbitrary violence, is the only outcome.\nWe have not yet, fortunately reached that\nstage, though we are getting uncomfortably close\nto it. There is a solution, which might work.\nNamely the formation of a Centre party. It\ndoesn't matter whether the Social Democratic\nParty will form the next government or not. What\ndoes matter is that it holds a balance of power in\nthe next parliament so that neither the New\nLabour Party, nor the New Conservative Partycan put through their extreme policies and ruin\nthis country.\nIf you love this country, as 1 do, then join the\nSDP. and work for them. We can't promise to\nmake things better, but at least we can ensure\nthat our country does not become the plaything\nof ideo logue s who would turn it into a wasteland.\nFrank James\nBookshop News\nPicture the scene, our illustrious tutor, sitting,\nmeditating, wondering, will it ever appear?\nSuddenly in a plain brown wrapper, on approval,\nthe book arrives.

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nThe Secret of Life, the Universe and\n\u00a39\neverything\n42\nLAST WEDNESDAY, Mrs Shirley Williams launched Imperial\nCollege's Social Democratic Society by giving a lecture on the\naims of the recently formed SDP.\nThe interest in Mrs Williams' speech was such that it had to be\nmoved from its original venue to the Great Hall to accomodate the\nlarge number of students and staff.\nMrs Williams began her speech by stating that the formation of the\nSDP was a bold experiment. If the experiment failed the consequences\nlor Britain would be, in her opinion, dire. II, however, the experiment\nsucceeded Britain would have a truly representative party in Westminster because no special interest group would be able to control\nthe party. Each member would have an equal vote in the governing of\nthe party.\nBoth major parties are so wrapped up with their own party dogmas\nthat they are blind to the fact that all they are doing is creating division\nin the country and ultimately threatening democracy.\nThe introduction of a system of proportional electoral representation\nwould allow other parties, like the SDP, to be more fairly represented\nat Westminster and eventually end the two party system.\nThe only current indication of the S DP's policies are the 'twelve\ntasks' unveiled by the collective leadership of the party earlier in the\nyear. Mrs Williams took the opportunity to elaborate on the future\npolicies of the SDP. Britain's lack of recent economic success arose directly from the in built class antagonism from both sides of industry.\nBritain's lack of recent economic success arose directly from the ' in built class antagonism' from both sides of industry. The SDP support\nthe idea of a mixed economy which encourages the Private Sector but\nat the same time has a responsible attitude towards the Public Sector.\nThe party also has a responsible attitude towards employment. The\nparty would alleviate the problem by having relevant youth training\nprogrammes which are currently totally inadequate. The party also\nbelieves that Britain has an international responsibility and therefore\nwould support NATO and the EEC whilst trying to change things\nfrom the inside. Previous Governments have been far too callous and\nshortsighted in their attitude towards the Third World. Her party\nbelieves in a Marshall Plan for the Third World countries, allowing\nthem to re vital is e their economies. The Social Democrats believe in\nunity, both nationally and internationally.\nMrs Williams summed up by reiterating the fact that the SDP was a party of all the people emancipated from divisions ol class.\nThere then followed a lively question session covering issues ranging\nfrom Bobby Sands to British Aerospace.\n22 students and 12 members of stall' joined the College Social\nDemocratic Society \u2022 directly after the lecture.\nThe SDP has substantial backing in Imperial College already. Lord Flowers, Rector of the College, has lent his support to the party in an\nadvertisement in The Guardian at the start of February and Mrs Williams' meting was chaired by Professor Sutton, Pro-Rector.\nThe party needs financial support and recommends on its\npromotional literature a jtf) donation.\nTHE RCSU ANNUAL DINNER was held last Friday evening\nin the Sherfield Building. Simon Jones, better known as\nArthur Dent of the successful radio and television series The Hitch-hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, was the guest speaker.\nHe was accompanied by David Learner (the man inside Marvin the\nParanoid Android) and special effects expert Jim Francis, who created\nsuch diverse items as the robot suit and a radio-controlled head for\nZaphod Beeblebrox for the television adaptation.\nRCS UH on Sec, Steve Tyson was shocked on Thursday lunchtime\nwhen he received a last minute cancellation from the show's author,\nDouglas Adams, who had been expected to speak. Fortunately, Simon\nJones agreed to replace him at very short notice and gave a confident\nand amusing speech.\nDavid Learner later donned his Marvin costume and joined in the\nfestivities in the Senior Common Room. When asked how many people had attended Mr Tyson said \" I don't know, I don't stand and count 'em, and it's not up to me to count them\neither.\" (Really folks!)\nElection Fever\nGrips UGM!\nTHE FIRST UGM of the term yesterday heard hustings speeches\nfor many posts before the quorum was successfully challenged\nwhen the meeting began to discuss motions.\nJohn Passmore, ICU President took the chair in the absence of Jon Firth. Mr Passmore in his presidential report outlined further his\nremarks in ExecNews. Rachel Snee, ICU Deputy President, said that at\nlast something was being done this week about the Southside security\nsystem. Liz Lindsay, Hon Sec, spoke extensively about the IN COST Conference over Easter, how successful it had been and how well those\ninvolved from IC had done.\nHustings were held for the post of Welfare Officer between Ian\nGreenwood and RS Pyne. The candidates for P WP were S Goulder, R Morgan, L Burry, S Rodan and P Coll. The Haldane Library Record\nBuyer was contested by Gordon Baxter and Alan Edwards.

TO wen and S Goulder and Miss C Tiller were ratified as\nmembers of Union House Committee. The post of LInion Publicity\nOfficer is still open.\nAfter the conclusion of the hustings it was announced that the motion\non the Brandt Report had been withdrawn. This was greeted with loud\ncheering. When the first speaker on the Nationality Bill was beginning,\nthe quorum was successfully challenged. There were about one hundred\npeople present at this generally good humour ed meeting. The election\nresults were not available at the time of going to press.\nNo. 583 Friday, May 8,1981 Free!\n\n"
