During the festive season,\nI spotted a copy of Felix residing by\none of the house/palace windows. I\nflicked through a few pages to be simply\naghast at the clap trap rubbish contained\nwithin, not excluding the hideous specimen gurning at me from the centerfold \u2013\nisn\u2019t it odd that at a university of mostly\nchaps, you have pictures of naked males\nin your paper? It\u2019s all rather how\u2019s-yourfather in a queerish way if you ask me. At\nIeast, I think it was a man. But you never\nknow with scientists.\nI asked the footman, Cardell, where this\ngarbage came from. It transpires his son\nis studying entrepreneurship at Imperial.\nAside from the contradiction in terms such\na degree presents (quite how one is supposed to develop maverick, out-of-the-box\nthinking by being pontificated to by failed\nbusinessmen is beyond me), I realised that\nthis was my chance to do something for so-ciety, as my little cauliflower keeps insist-ing, and I would bestow you fortunate lot\nwith my weekly wisdom.\nI imagine your holidays were affected by\nHeathrow\u2019s decision to close after a pithy\n2mm snow drizzle. I hated having to endure\nthe moaning of all those ghastly foreigners on the television \u2013 I mean, couldn\u2019t\nBAA just get them to help shift the snow\nor shoot the lot? And I can only hope the\nplebs at BA soon dismiss Willie Walsh \u2013\nthat pea-headed, penis-named executive.\nThis whole country is becoming a tad of an\nanimal farm, one far darker and more terrifying than anything George Orwell could\nfathom\nBut enough about your holiday. Mine was\nhorrendous. Some Irish acquaintances vis-ited, all naturally lacking a native accent.\nThey were very down \u2013 I did point out that\noffering free handouts of cheddar to the\npoor was never going to prevent the financial collapse of their country.\nAnd Charlie kept harping on in bufferish\nindignation about all that climate change\ngibberish. He\u2019s always been a bit thick, not\nmuch of a stickler for science. First he was\ntalking to plants, next he was saying we will\nall die by drowning.\nAs for his horse-faced wife, she was still\nin shock about being poked in the eye by\nsome lower class yobbos. I was quite glad\nabout the whole affair, and it\u2019s not the only\nplace I would have prodded her. She\u2019s quite\nthe farter, I tell you. If you think the Iraq\nwar stinks, you know nothing of Camilla\u2019s\nposterior. Makes one feel for feel for Tony\nBlair \u2013 just imagine having to endure sitting\nnext to a trumpeting John Prescott in all of\nthose cabinet meetings.\nLetters: Life Sciences cuts\nDear Sir,\nI recall when I was campaigning against the\neducation cuts, our union and our newspaper\u2019s\neditorial stance was in support of them on the\nbasis that STEM subjects would be hit less (Fe-lix. 22/10/10). The message, I felt, was a selfish\none; cut others rather than us and we\u2019re happy.\nEven regarding tuition fees I\u2019ve heard so many\npeople tell me that they won\u2019t be protesting because it doesn\u2019t affect them personally.\nImagine my surprise when last week\u2019s Felix went into a panic about the Life Sciences\nrestructure. It\u2019s shameful that our newspaper\nseems happy to watch others suffer cuts but goes\ninto a frenzy - printing no less than four articles\n- criticising the move and the entire front page\ndedicated to it, when we ourselves are threat-ened. If we\u2019re so apathetic, hypocritical and\nself-interested, we cannot expect others to support us. The ruling elite will always try divide-and-conquer tactics, we must have solidarity.\nRegards,\nJakov Marelic\nDear Sir,\nWhether one is at a college, school or univer-sity, there is always bound to be a group of academia that would go the extra mile far beyond\ntheir call of duty.\nThe dedication shown by these individuals\ntowards us students was not only seen at the\nlecture theatre. Coming to Imperial College\nwas my first time being completely independent and away from home for long periods of\ntime. I was enchanted by the city that is London and drifted away from my main purpose\nof coming to London, to study. I barely passed\nmy first major exam in February as a result of\nmy fascination towards this city and my lack of\ninterest in studying.\nHowever, when going through the examination paper with Dr. Hartley, he reminded me\nwhy I chose Biochemistry in the first place. At\nthis time, I doubted my abilities in Biochemistry but he had faith that if I tried I could do bet-ter. This belief from another person who barely\nknew me, yet was so sure and confident that I\nwould succeed in Biochemistry definitely gave\nme the boost I needed.\nThe college and I have been privileged with\nthe presence of this group of scientists who\ncarry such passion and dedication towards the\nsciences. So thank you, to this fine group of\nscientists for inspiring and reminding me about\nmy passion and faith for the sciences.\nVarshana Rajasekaran\n2nd year Biochemist.\nDear Sir,\nWe first year biochemists recently held a discussion of the proposed restructure. This letter\nis the product of our collective concerns. These\nissues are all the more pressing in light of the\nrecent vote to maintain the current proposals.\nOur primary concern is the redundancy of\n16 members of the Life Sciences department.\nTogether, they account for roughly 25% of all\nteaching. We can\u2019t see how standards of teaching will be maintained when those left will understandably be more concerned about their research than their teaching, let alone improved.\nWe were told that no plans concerning teaching can be made without a teaching review. Yet\nwe were also guaranteed that there would be no\nchange in breadth and depth of the course. To\nconduct this from a financial and research perspective seems short\u2013sighted and irresponsible.\nNot only will future applicants be discouraged\nfrom coming to Imperial, but so will potential\nstaff and researchers.\nWe believe that the process lacked transpar-ency. For example we have not yet received a\ncopy of the review panel fidings. There was\nalso a feeling of outrage at the announcement\nbeing on the 3/12 giving little time for constructive debate.\nFinally, it is discouraging to those of us looking to pursue research and teaching if this is\nhow top institutions treat some of their best\nstaff. As one protester put it, \u2018today\u2019s students\nare tomorrow\u2019s researchers\u2019\nFirst Year Biochemistry Undergraduates\nNew Year, same old you...\nS\nelf-improvement can and should be done\nat any time. Needing an arbitrary start\ndate for the \u201cnew you\u201d is pretty pathetic\nsince you were more than aware of your\nflaws already, weren\u2019t you? That bit of\nflab is nothing new even if you christen it \u201cChristmas\nexcess\u201d. New Year\u2019s resolutions conveniently allow\nyou to delay change until the beginning of the following year.\nNow, if you made the change at New Year\u2019s and\nstuck with it perhaps I could come to terms with the\nidea of New Year\u2019s resolutions, but between you, me\nand that lamppost, it\u2019s not going to last. The chances\nof keeping New Year\u2019s resolutions are slim; it\u2019s often\nsaid that most people have broken theirs by the end\nof January. I get a huge kick out of using the word\n\u201cslim\u201d, as weight loss is what I really want to whine\nabout.\nEat less, exercise more. Why do so many wannabe-fit people try and escape this mantra? When people\nsay it\u2019s easy to lose weight and get fit, they are lying,\nbecause they are advertising weight loss regimes. It\u2019s\nnot easy; abs don\u2019t come from nowhere. As with most\nthings, you would like to wriggle out of the hard work\ninvolved.\nBut you already know all the advice, e.g. setting\nyourself achievable goals. I\u2019m not here to give advice\nabout weight loss because it\u2019s been in the public domain for a long time now. I\u2019m here to tell you to stop\nbeing a namby pamby. (Same as \u201cman up\u201d but not so\noverused that people ignore it.)\nWe\u2019ve all heard that it\u2019s better to \u201ceat little but often\u201d. The physiological benefit of this approach is\nirrelevant here because seemingly rational people\nchoose to translate this into eating as many meals and\nsnacks as is socially acceptable in a day. More when\nthey think no\u2013one is looking. To them, it means \u201chave\nas many portions as you want as long as they are all\nsmall\u201d. They seem to miss the point, which is \u201cEAT\nLESS, PIGS!\u201d\nI suppose knowing what is best for oneself, but\nbeing too lazy and greedy to act upon it, is merely\na part of the human condition. It is human nature\nand no\u2013one is perfect, least of all myself. I admit that\nshort\u2013term pleasures are sweet and doing what\u2019s best\nin the long term is a dry, dry prospect in comparison.\nHowever, the important thing is not to lie to yourself (and others) about what you are actually \u201cresolved\u201d to do. The gym at Ethos is an absolute haven\nand you have a fair idea of what a healthy balanced\ndiet consists of, so just get on with it. Bridget Jones\nmay have been able to get away with it but you can\u2019t.\nAlex Nowbar\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to\ngive advice about\nweight-loss. I\u2019m\nhere to tell you to\nman up!\u201d\nDear Jakov, the Editorial you refer to merely\nwarned Imperial students against asking\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the fuss about?\u201d as STEM subjects\nare relatively unaffected by the cuts. In ad-dition, Felix has covered the cuts and student\nprotests extensively. The issue preceding the\nLife Sciences coverage had no less than 5 stories about the student protests, rising student\ndebt and the cuts to higher education. Editor.\nFriday 14 january 2011\n\n"

Molecules of this pigment, Xanthopterin, transform light\ninto electrical energy through a photo-biochemical\nprocess which allows the hornets to be most active\nin the middle of the day. This is especially surprising\nas until now, the insects were thought to perform\nmetabolism in an organ, similar to the human liver,\ncalled the fat body.\nJohn Gribbin made his name with \u2018In Search of Schrodinger\u2019s Cat\u2019, an essential read for any aspiring\nPhysics student. Before this, however, he collaborated with Michael White to produce this early biography of Stephen Hawking. The book covers his\nformative years and the reputation he built as a\ncosmologist.\nWhilst focusing mainly on Hawking\u2019s career as a\nphysicist, the authors also manage to convincingly\nportray his family life as well as the media frenzy\nthat surrounded (and in fact still does surround) the\nfact that he suffers from Motor-neurone syndrome.\nIt is often felt that the authors detached themselves from the emotional aspect of Hawking\u2019s ill-ness. However, this actually serves to make the\nbook a more convincing science biography. Hawking\nhimself always seeks to downplay his illness so it\nis fitting that the authors do not make it the main\nfocus of the book. Hawking is a remarkable character with a sense of humour to match. This biography\nportrays the man and his science superbly.\nKatya-Yani Vyas\nSir Francis: crime fighter\nThea Cunningham\nFor those of you familiar with TV crime series like C.S.I and Dexter, you\u2019ll know that\nfingerprinting plays a large part in catching\nthe wanted. But you might not be aware that\nif it weren\u2019t for a man named Francis Galton,\nusing fingerprints to catch criminals wouldn\u2019t\nbe possible. In fact, the British psychologist\nnot only pioneered the use of fingerprinting in\ncriminal cases, but he also coined the \u2018nature\nversus nurture\u2019 debate and made serious efforts\nto measure brainpower in the 19th and early\n20th centuries. This month marks the 100th anniversary of his death.\nBorn on 22 February 1822, Galton was an intelligent child. He took a shine to science at an\nearly age and aged 18, enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge to study medicine, although\nhe later swapped to mathematical sciences.\nGalton was a keen sportsman and traveller, exploring Egypt, Syria and South Africa. He was\nelected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society upon his return from the latter.\nMuch of Galton\u2019s early work focused on human intelligence. A half-cousin of Charles Darwin \u2013 they shared the same grandfather, physician Erasmus Darwin \u2013 Galton was inspired\nby the Origin of Species, in particular Darwin\u2019s\nFriday 14 December 2011\nYou won\u2019t believe it...\nresearch on domestic breeding. Galton believed\nthat humans inherited their abilities from their\nparents like the animals and plants Darwin de-scribed. He was an extreme advocate of nature\nover nurture, believing genius was genetically\ndetermined. In 1869, he published his first\nbook, Hereditary Genius, in which he proposed\na method for ranking people\u2019s natural abilities.\nGalton\u2019s later book, English Men of Science:\nTheir Nature and Nurture, published in 1874,\nwas the result of his study of prominent figures\nin England and their education, parentage and\nfamily achievements. In it he proposed that\nbirth order was correlated with achievement in\nlater life.\nGalton believed individuals with superior\nmental and physical capabilities would enhance society. He questioned whether the human race could be improved in a Darwinian\nstyle, by discouraging reproduction between\npeople with undesirable traits, and instead\nfavoured mixing between healthy, mentally\nstrong families. Galton coined the now wide-ly-known concept \u2018eugenics\u2019, which seeks to\nimprove the human race. His campaign gained\nmomentum across the UK and America, and\nwas backed by politicians. It was only after\nHitler and the Nazis exploited the concept in\nthe twentieth century that the concept gained\nnegative connotations.\nIn his later years, Galton became interested\nin fingerprinting as a tool to identify racial dif-ferences, and links between families and intel-lect. He collected over 8,000 sets of prints and\nstudied these fastidiously. Galton confirmed the\nwork of Sir William James Herschel years be-fore, who had proposed that no two fingerprints\nare identical, nor do they change over time. In\n1892, Galton published Fingerprints, which\nshowcased a classification technique that was\nlater adapted by police forces as a method with\nwhich to convict criminals.\nA man of many talents, Galton also dipped\nhis toes in statistics, coining the concepts of\ncorrelation and standard deviation, and also\nfound time to invent a test to decipher differential hearing, and create the world\u2019s first weather\nmap.\nIn recognition of his achievements, Galton\nwas knighted in 1909. By the time of his death\ntwo years later on 17 January 1911, Galton had\npublished over 300 books and his ideas had filtered into many different fields. A century on\nand his ideas still influence forensics, anthropology and statistics. The nature/nurture debate\nstill prevails, but perhaps most importantly,\nGalton uncovered the origins of genius that has\nhelped modern psychology today.\nThea Cunningham\nImaginary sweets can help you resist the temptation of these sugary treats\nSweet thoughts curb hunger pangs\nWant to shed your Christmas bulge but can\u2019t\nresist the Quality Streets? Then imagine eating\nthem, for it could help you in the long run. A\nstudy published in Science over the festive period has shown how imagining eating a certain\nfood can reduce your consumption of that food.\nThe team at Carnegie Mellon University in\nPennsylvania got their participants to simulate\neating imaginary M&M\u2019s. The more M&M\u2019s\nthe participants imagined they devoured, the\nfewer M&M\u2019s they actually ate when they\nwere offered a real bowl full of the chocolate\ntreats afterwards.\n\u201cTo some extent, merely imagining an experience is a substitute for the actual experience\u201d,\nsaid team member Joachim Vosgerau. \u201cThe difference between imagining and experiencing\nmay be smaller than previously assumed.\u201d Of\ncourse, simply thinking about your favourite\nfood, or any other food for that matter, won\u2019t\nkeep you from eating it \u2013 you will need to repeatedly simulate chewing it.\nFor a long time it\u2019s been widely assumed that\nthinking about your favourite fat-laden foods\nwill make your cravings for them even stron-ger. The results, then, are likely to bring relief\nto New Year dieters trying to stave off thoughts\nof roast dinners and turkey sandwiches. As lead\nauthor of the study Carey Morewedge conclud-ed: \u201cThese findings suggest that trying to suppress one\u2019s thoughts of desired foods in order\nto curb cravings for those foods is a fundamentally flawed strategy.\u201d\nBut before you head home for your imaginary meal, spare a thought for your blood sugar\nlevels. Successful self-control requires a great\ndeal of energy. This energy comes in the form\nof glucose, our body\u2019s natural fuel. In 2007, a\nsocial psychologist at Florida State University,\nRoy Baumeister, carried out an experiment to\nshow that people are more likely to lack self-control when their glucose levels are low.\nIn the study, Baumeister got his participants,\nwho had fasted for a couple of hours previous-ly, to take part in mental tasks, such as focusing\non a film or trying to suppress negative stereo-types. The students made to exert focused self-control had significantly lower levels of blood\nglucose than those who were not made to.\nThese tests confirmed that self-control is dependent on glucose, but more importantly, that\nour glucose supplies are exhaustible. Baumeister likened self-control to muscle; it becomes\ntired if it\u2019s exerted too much. In much the same\nway, controlling our responses to situations\nexhausts our body\u2019s supply of glucose. This is\ncalled \u2018ego depletion\u2019 and it makes us less able\nto carry out other activities demanding self-control, like resisting those foods that we fancy.\nFor resolute dieters, thinking about willpower in this way might prove useful. For example,\nif you\u2019re exhausted after a long day at work,\nchances are you\u2019re not going to have the self-control to choose a salad over a sandwich. The\nonly way to reinstate your depleted bodily resources is through rest. So if your diet is wearing you thin, make sure you get a good night\u2019s\nsleep and that your energy levels are topped\nup. Or better still; try imagining eating your favourite sweets and treats. Where there\u2019s a will,\nthere\u2019s a way.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 11\nSCIENCE\nFriday 14 December 2011\nMaciej Matuszewski\nSci-fi\nColumn\nAs this is the first issue after the Christmas break I\u2019m going to review the Doctor Who Christmas Special. I\u2019ve always\nenjoyed the specials but I wasn\u2019t particularly hopeful for this one after the\npreviews showed that it would be based\non the Christmas Carol. It seemed like\nthere was very little that the writers\ncould add to this classic story and that,\nby resorting to copying Dickens, they\nhad simply run out of ideas.\nAt first, the episode seemed to confirm\nmy fears. It begins on Christmas Eve\nwith a spaceship whose clearly incompetent crew has managed to trap it in a\nplanet\u2019s turbulent atmosphere, which will\nshortly destroy it. Fortunately, Amy and\nRoy are onboard for their honeymoon\ncruise and manage to contact the Doctor. Unfortunately for the viewers they\nspend the entire episode in, respectively,\ntheir policewoman and Roman Centurion costumes from last season. While\nthis is given a plausible explanation as\nbit of \u2018roleplay\u2019 during one of their first\nnights as a married couple it simply looks\nridiculous. I can honestly see no reason\nwhy the show\u2019s creators thought that this\nwould add anything to the episode.\nFor some highly contrived reason,\nwhich is explained in one line of dia-logue, the Doctor can\u2019t just land the\nTARDIS inside the spaceship but must\ninstead persuade the owner of the planet\u2019s weather control device to allow the\nspaceship to land safely. When the miserly Kazran Sardick refuses, the Doctor\ndecides to go back in time to Kazran\u2019s\nyouth to change him into a better person.\nThe story, however, quickly picks up\nas the Doctor assumes the roles of the\nthree ghosts from the Christmas Carol\nto achieve this task. I was genuinely\nsurprised by how the writers managed\nto give this premise a new twist. It was\nparticularly ingenious how, inspired by\nthe ghost of Christmas Yet-to-come,\nhe brought a young Kazram forward in\ntime to show him what sort of person\nhe could become if he wasn\u2019t careful.\nThis blending of Doctor Who\u2019s usual\nscience fiction themes and the Dickensian elements gave the story an interesting steampunk feel. Despite their\nabsurd outfits, I was also happy to see\nthat the regular companions were given\nmeaningful roles to play. What \u2019s more,\nthe writers refrained from presenting\nan easy technobabble solution, with the\nending being very satisfying; flowing\nlogically from what we had seen.\nThis was certainly nowhere near the\nbest Doctor Who episode, with the\nearly problems being compounded by\nan occasional lack of tension and slow\npace. It was, however, still an enjoyable\nhour\u2019s viewing and one of the better\nthings that I saw over Christmas.\nEcologists and environmental scientists\nare trying hard to raise public awareness\nabout environmental problems. I believe\nthat everyone understands that we live\non a suffering planet which has various\nincreasing needs and demands, which\nis why cities all over the world have set\nhigh targets to reduce carbon emissions\nand produce clean energy. However, a\nvery interesting alternative has started to\nevolve. Why not build new \u201cgreen\u201d cities from scratch?\nSuch a city would be called an EcoCity or a Sustainable City and would\nbe designed specifically to minimize its\nenergy, water and food needs, reduce its\npollution and waste of resources, and\nbe able to supply goods to its inhabitants with minimal reliance on the surrounding countryside. Fortunately, this\nrelatively new idea is being applied at\nthe moment in two places, one in China\ncalled Dongtan (near Shanghai), and\none in the United Arab Emirates called\nMasdar (17 km from Abu Dhabi).\nPlans for Dongtan city started in 2005.\nIt is located in a corner of Chongming\nIsland which is going to be connected\nwith Shanghai by a bridge and a tunnel\nlink. It will consist of three inter-linked\nvillages, and all of them will combine\nhomes, businesses and places for recre-ation.

Another benefit is that\nelectric cars are quiet so thinner materials can be used in building construction\nas there will be less noise to drown out.\nMore than 60 per cent of the whole site\nis being allocated to parks and farmland\nand they expect an initial 83 per cent\nreduction in waste sent to landfills compared to other cities. As great amounts\nof rice husks are available in the area,\nthey will be burned to produce energy\nand the releasing CO2\nof this burn is going to be captured and fed into green-houses.\nIronically, Masdar is located in a\ncountry that is a leading producer of fossil fuels yet it will be one of the most\necologically healthy cities. Its area will\nbe 6.5 km2\nwith a population of around\n50,000 people and a total cost of around\n22 billions dollars. A light railway line\nwill provide a transport link to Abu Dhabi and nobody will be more than 200m\naway from the public transport. A desalination plant will provide 8000m3\nof\nwater a day, and 60 per cent of the water\nused in Masdar will be recycled.\nAs you can imagine, in an Eco-City\nair-conditioning is not an acceptable\nsolution to the problem of high tem-peratures, so scientists and engineers are\nfocused on insulation and ventilation,\nand the maximization of shade. This is\nachieved by packing the streets of the\ncity closer together and by limiting the\nmaximum height of the buildings to four\nor five storeys. Engineers will use thin\nwalls that react quickly to the sun and a\nthin metal layer on the outside to reflect\nthe heat and stop it from penetrating the\nbuilding.\nOne major difference between Masdar\nand typical cities is that the whole city\nwill be raised with the pedestrian level\nfree of vehicles and consequently, traffic\nnoise.

The state entered into the longest civil war in African history just one\nyear before its independence in 1956.\nThe war, chiefly between its Muslim\nNorth and Christian/ Animist (a tribal\ntradition) South, claimed 2 million lives;\nfinally ending in 2005 with a peace accord between the two sides, bringing\nwith it the promise of a referendum on\nSouthern independence which began\nlast Sunday, the results of which are expected at the end of the month.\nIndependence has long been a desire\nfor the country\u2019s South who cite not just\nthe religious differences with the North\nbut also that a recent economic boom,\nas well as much of international aid,\nwas centred around the country\u2019s capi-POLITICS\nFELIX 17\nture based voting form will help - two\nhands clasped means continued unity,\none hand held up means separation.\nSigns are promising; although the\nPresident of Sudan, Omar Al-Bashir, has\nwarned that the South faces instability if\nit separates, he has also said he will accept the decision and will help the new\nstate in whatever way they require.\nNevertheless, the international community will be watching the vote closely.\nThe UN already has 10,000 peace keeping troops in the country, not including\nthose in Darfur, and the country\u2019s neigh-tal Khartoum which lies in the North.\nThey also feel that the North has being\nmaking disproportionate gains from oil\nfields in the South. Squabbling over\nthe details of the promised referendum\nonly increased tensions between the\ntwo sides.\nFew people doubt that the South will\nvote for independence. The required\nthreshold of a 60% turnout was reached\nby Wednesday \u2013 no simple task with illiteracy at over 80% in the South making\ncommunication difficult. Supporters of a\nsecession hope that the simplified, pic\u201cWe can abandon the euro if our proposal is refused.\u201d Angela Merkel, the\nGerman chancellor, said to George Papandreou, the Greece prime minister,\nduring dinner at the EU summit in Brussels last October. The summit was held\nto discuss the euro crisis and a plan to\nbail out Ireland. Merkel had demanded\na new legislation stating that bailed-out countries should lose certain voting\nrights in EU councils. Since it is only\nGermany that can pay a large amount of\nmoney as a bailout, the country is asked\nto bear the greatest burden whenever a\ndebt crisis happens. Such unfairness has\ncertainly made the German populace\nuncomfortable, but insisting on the loss\nof EU council voting rights was opposed\nby many other EU governments.\nThe other reason why Germany suggested that quitting the euro was an option may be that the bailout of Ireland is\nnot the end of a sequence of bailout actions which started with Greece. Spain\nand Portugal will soon have the same\ndebt problem, and they will call for bail-50% or more.\nEight years ago, Argentina defaulted\non the major part of its sovereign debt\nand survived quite well. Many economists predicted that Argentina\u2019s debt default would result in currency collapse,\nhyperinflation and even greater economic contraction than it had endured during\nits 1999-2002 recession. Instead, after\nthe 2001-02 debt default and subsequent\ndevaluation against the dollar (from 1:1\nto 3:1), GDP grew at over 8% per annum\nover the period 2003-2007 and annual\ninflation fell from over 10% per month\nin early 2002 to less than 10% per annum.\u201d\nHe thinks that choosing to default and\nabandoning the euro are better than submitting to the ferocious and pro-cyclical\nconditionality imposed by Germany and\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n\u2013 cutting its budget deficit by 11%\nover three years in return for a \u20ac120bn\n(\u00a3104bn) loan. His opinion is convinc-ing. In general, devaluation caused by\nan increase in the monetary base in a\ncountry makes the country more competitive in terms of exports, which helps\nout plans. To make matters worse, even\nthough the EU, led by Germany, saves\nall these countries, an essential problem\nhas not been resolved. As readers know,\nunlike the UK, in the present euro system each country which belongs to the\neurozone cannot print euro banknotes to\npay their governmental debts since all\nmonetary policies, such as issuing euro\nbanknotes in the Eurozone, are made by\nthe European Central Bank (ECB), and\ntherefore, whenever a nation in the eurozone hits a fiscal brink, the debt problem\nrequires the ECB and the EU (particu-larly Germany) to pay up.\nThe more serious the euro crisis be-comes, the more fragile the partnership\namong eurozone countries becomes.\nNow, we may well consider what the\nbest solution for the debt problem of\nPIIGS (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece\nand Spain) is. George Irvin, a columnist of guardian.co.uk, said \u201cGreece\ncould follow Argentina\u2019s example in\n2001-02, and default on the bulk of its\nsovereign debt. This would mean abandoning the euro, introducing a \u201cnew\ndrachma\u201d and probably devaluing by\nThe Euro is on life support: will Germany turn it off?\nTomokazu Miyamoto\nRory Fenton\nit recover from a recession. Unfortunately, in the eurozone, many countries\nwhich have small-sized economies cannot benefit from this devaluation. Thus\nIceland, which has its own currency, the\nIceland krona, is in a slightly better economic situation than PIIGS. The island\ncountry in the North Atlantic Ocean was\nin default in 2008, and the current account balance was 15% of its GDP, and\nthen devaluation of krona improved its\nexport as well as the current account balance to 3.7% of its GDP in 2009. The\nunemployment of Iceland worsened to\n8% in 2010, but it is still better than\nSpain\u2019s 20%, Ireland\u2019s 14%, Greece\u2019s\n12% and Portugal\u2019s 11% in 2010.\nIrvin is not the only person who recommends that Greece should abandon\nthe euro. Ivan Miklos, the Slovac finance minister, said \u201cGreece and Portugal would be better off in a long run if\nthey didn\u2019t share the euro.\u201d Miklos also\nsaid that the economies of the two nations and other southern eurozone countries were not fit enough for the euro,\npointing out defects in the present euro\nsystem. Petr Necas, the prime minister\nof the Czech Republic, said that nobody\ncould force his country to join the eu-rozone, and that it was solely up to the\nCzechs\u2019 will. According to a poll last\nOctober, nearly 70% of Czech citizens\noppose dropping their own currency.\nDescribing the merit of controlling their\nown currency, he also said that entering\nthe euro now, or even setting a target\ndate, would be political and economic\nfoolishness.\nIf Greece leaves the euro system, other nations may follow. If many of them\nquit the euro, the currency will disap-pear. Anyway, the year 2010 was the\nturning point for that currency.\nDoes the Euro measure up?\nSouth Sudan: democracy amidst chaos\nbours are preparing reluctantly for the\nprobable secession; the most turbulent\nparts of both Kenya and Uganda are\nthose that border Sudan and this move is\nunlikely to stabilise the area.\nThe North will not happily lose the\nSouth, the oil fields of which are a lucrative source of revenue.

The recent rise in the\nrate of VAT has been cited as the main\ndriver of the cost increase, although other pressures \u2013 including an increase in\nfuel duty, also put into place this month\n\u2013 have contributed to the mounting financial pressure.\nThe Director of Commercial Services,\nJane Neary, initially suggested that student prices would not be affected, say-ing: \u201cThe VAT won\u2019t affect the student\nprices.\u201d When challenged she explained\nthat \u201ca few product prices may have\nbeen very slightly affected\u201d by the application of the VAT increase on visitor\nprices. Although student purchases on\ncampus are not subject to VAT \u2013 hence\nthe swipe card discount \u2013 Mrs. Neary\ntold Felix, \u201cbecause of the link between\nthe [student and visitor/staff] prices on\nthe system, we\u2019ve had to round up or\ndown certain student prices.\u201d\nThe prices of popular food and nonalcoholic drink items show both small\npercentage increases and decreases.\nPrices on average have seen an increase\nof 0.5%.\nPrices at the Union have risen more\nsignificantly. Lagers have gone up by\naround 10p, a 5% increase on last term;\nthe price of spirits has increased by 20p\non average, up 10%; soft drinks have\nseen an increase of 5p. Peanuts have\nrisen by 50% from 50p to 75p.\nA Union spokesperson told Felix that\nthe reason the increase in price on certain items was larger than the rise in\nVAT was due to a number of factors, including other price pressures. There was\na need \u201cto apply a 3% increase\u201d unrelated to VAT at the start of the academic\nyear but the Union had held back that\nincrease to \u201cavoid changing prices twice\nduring the same academic year.\u201d\nThe spokesperson went on to say that\nThis week sees the launch of the National Student Survey (NSS) 2011 at most\nHigher and Further education institutions across the UK, including Imperial.\nEntering its seventh year, the NSS is\nintended to provide the opportunity for\nfinal year students to reflect on their time\nat their institution and voice their opinions on their course.\nThe survey results feature in numerous university league tables. The Independent, Sunday Times, and Times\nall use it to determine student satisfac-tion, whilst the Guardian employs it for\nteaching quality.\nLast year, Imperial College London\nachieved an overall satisfaction rating of\n85%, placing it 43rd nationally and 13th\namongst Russell Group universities.\nThe college\u2019s learning resources rating\nof 90% was well above the national av-erage.\nHowever, student satisfaction with assessment and feedback was distinctly\nsub-par. Prof Julia Buckingham, Pro\nRector (Education), stated at the time\n\u201cIt is an issue we are taking seriously,\nand are continuing to address. With\nthe Union \u201cwas prepared to incur the\ncost [of the VAT increase] in certain circumstances\u201d. For example, in maintaining \u201cthe Wednesday night offer of \u00a31.50\na pint and all week long \u00a32.00 for a pint\nof Becks or IPA.\u201d\nRegarding the large jump in the price\nof peanuts and crisps, the spokesperson\nsaid that the Union had previously been\nselling these items at \u201cbelow the normal\nprofit margin\u201d, in part to compensate for\n\u201cthe [previous] lack of facilities to supply [high-quality] food.\u201d\nThe raising of VAT from 17.5% to\n20% has been the subject of serious\ncontroversy. A recent survey revealed\nfears amongst senior managers that retailers will use the confusion of the tax\nhike to mask the raising of their prices\nwell beyond the VAT rate, while opposition leader Ed Miliband branded the rise\nas the \u201cwrong tax at the wrong time.\u201d\nGeorge Osborne, the Chancellor, maintained that the rise was the most \u201cprogressive\u201d option available.\nNational Student Survey\nlaunched\nthat in mind I\u2019m delighted the Rector\nhas placed assessment and feedback\nhigh on his agenda. He has written to\nheads of departments and directors of\nundergraduate studies, asking them to\nmake this a priority, and requesting that\ndepartments lay down clear timelines\nindicating when students can expect\nfeedback for work submitted.\u201d The Rector embarked on an ambitious drive to\nimprove standards, setting departments\na two-week deadline for marking and\nreturning work.\nFollowing these exertions, the college will be hoping for a whopping\nimprovement on last year\u2019s results although it is widely expected that the results for the Biology and Biochemistry\ncourses will take a hit following widespread student discontent with the Life\nSciences cuts.\nAll eligible students are encouraged to\ntake part \u2013 higher turnout rate resulting\nin more credible data. If participation is\nless than 50%, the NSS will not accept\nthe results. The question of whether last\nyear\u2019s situation has been improved upon\nwill be answered when the results are\npublished in August 2011.\nwww.thestudentsurvey.com\nEarlier starts, later lectures and\nshorter lunch breaks on the cards\nOne important steer the group have been\ngiven is that the length of the teaching\nday for individual students should not be\nincreased.\u201d\nDeputy President (Education) Alex\nDahinten recognised the \u201chistorical\u201d\nproblem that departments have had with\ntimetable clashes, but he highlighted the\neffects that extending the day could have\non college life: \u201cPotentially extending\nthe College Day comes with serious\nside effects such as Club & Society or\nSports events having to be put on later\nin the evening, putting off students from\nNavid Nabijou\ntaking humanities as well as generally\nexhausting students by putting them\nthrough a very long day of studies.\u201d\nHe reassured Felix that students would\nbe involved and would be able to put\nforward their views: \u201cStudent reps have\nbeen consulted, and students can be assured that every issue will be presented\nat the meeting by the [Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies) Heather Jones] and\nmyself. I have been guaranteed that the\nstudent experience is at the forefront of\nthis discussion, and the Union will make\nsure that this is the case.\u201d\n...Continued from Front Page\nTsk tsk, late for lectures again...\nTom Welch\nCharles Betts\nNavid Nabijou\nChristopher Walmsley\nVAT explained\nVAT (value added tax)\nrose from 17.5% to\n20% on January 4th.\nIt is applied to all\n\u2018luxury\u2019 items bought\nand sold.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 14 JANUARY 2011 33\nAt the mere mention of the place certain thoughts spring to mind. Chris\nRichardson decided it would be the perfect Christmas revision getaway\nFestive antics in Amsterdam\nA\nmsterdam: when the\nword is spoken bells immediately begin to ring.\nIt\u2019s one of those places\nthat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s todo list, whether the intentions be noble\nor otherwise. Following a whimsical\nconversation many sleepy Sundays ago\nwe decided that it would be the perfect\npre-Christmas destination, a place to unwind and soak up some cultural delights.\nMy sincere condolences to those who\nwere stranded indefinitely over the festive season, who may have had important places to be, unlike us. We were a\nfew of the lucky ones who managed to\nmake it overseas without issues, which\nwas probably the only time in history\nwhere a budget airline has been spot on.\nWith return flights from budget airlines\ncosting less than train tickets home,\nthere\u2019s really no excuse to not travel.\nWe arrived to a snow-shrouded city,\ngreeted with crisp frozen canals while\naccordions chirped in the background\nof the conversations that flowed. Having been tipped off by several people,\nincluding a couple at the airport, we\nheaded for the city\u2019s resident St. Christopher\u2019s Inn. I\u2019m not sure about their international reputation but we were told\nthis one was reliable enough. Located\nbang in the centre just off Dam Square,\nthis gem had a bar and nightclub down-stairs, with lots of things offered to hostel customers at discount rates.\nThe rooms have had extensive painting work from some big local names\nas well as some international artists: it\nhardly gives an ambient honeymoon feel\nbut for our purposes it more than suf-ficed. As always, haggling was in order\nand I managed to save us a total of 150\nEuros: result! After dumping our backpacks we did what anyone else would\ndo and decided to hit up our first cof-feeshop.\nNaturally we had recommendations\nfor these too, so headed for Hill Street\nBlues to tick it off the list. We bumped\ninto a very upstanding gentleman en-route, who offered to take us to said\ncoffeeshop. Despite our protests that we\ncould see said coffeeshop right in front\nof us, he insisted that we follow him into\nthe adjacent alleyway, presumably for a\nbetter time of some description. We refused and marched onward, only to be\ngreeted inside the coffeeshop by a local\npoliceman. In cute attire and in flawless\nEnglish he asked us what the man outside had said to us, then proceeded with\na smile and a wink to wish us a happy\ntime in Amsterdam. A far cry from the\ntypical run-in with a policeman in the\nmotherland, not that I\u2019m a regular or\nanything.\nI\u2019m assuming that since at least one\nImperial hall of residence is taking its\nfreshers to Amsterdam that we\u2019re not\ngoing to dance around the subject of\nmarijuana. Equally it won\u2019t dominate\nthis article, and shouldn\u2019t dominate your\ntime if and when you visit. It\u2019s quite surreal though, and I\u2019d really recommend\nlooking up the laws surrounding soft\ndrugs. They seem to have a policy that\nworks, with lower marijuana consumption than many other destinations, and a\npolice force that can better spend their\ntime on bigger issues.\nBeing coffeeshop virgins we approached the lovely lady over the coun-ter, an expat who was more than happy\nto help. We were presented with a menu\noffering several varieties and asked what\ntype of sensation we were seeking and\nrecommended some types. This is \u2018probably\u2019 better than the system over here,\nwhich presumably involves accepting\nthe bag with debatable contents from a\ndodgy fellow in a trench coat. As is custom we purchased drinks with our order,\nlistened to some music, and as conversations ceased to flow we departed leaving\na small tip on our way out.\nFloating around the city, there are a\nfew noticeable things. For starters, the\nlack of the louts that have become oh-so protocol in this country. Or perhaps\nthey just like to be in my proximity on a\nnight out, I don\u2019t know. The other more\nprominent feature of the city is the archi-tecture: skinny buildings arising from a\ndreaded width tax, tilting forward over\nfrom piss. I personally blame god for\nill-equipping us with a tiny bladder:\nevidently when designing he didn\u2019t consider the possibilities of cinema or long\nbus journeys.\nI should probably enlighten you as to\nthe origins of these fun facts of the city.\nSandemans New Europe Tours (neweu-ropetours.eu) offer free walking tours of\nseveral major European cities, Amsterdam included. The idea is that following the walking tour you pay what you\nthink the tour is worth. Be generous,\nmind: tour guides have to buy tickets\nfrom an employer so must make back at\nleast that just to break even. We saw the\nreal ins and outs of the city and I added\ncountless fun facts to my booming repertoire \u2013 I\u2019d really recommend it.\nWe befriended our guide Tina, and\none evening she volunteered to take us\ninto the depths of the red light district.\nThankfully my girlfriend and I broke\nthat taboo back in Thailand so a mandatory stroll through that side of town\nwas both interesting and informative.\nFor instance, the presence of the church\nslap bang in the centre of the district:\nsome would say this is a little odd, but\neconomically this makes perfect sense.\nBack in the day, sailors from lands afar\nwould stopover to spend their hard-earned cash on gambling and prostitutes,\nand would of course have to repent their\nsins. Luckily the nearby church offered\nthat service, and also started doing a \u2018repent in advance\u2019 scheme: the revenue\nfrom such an empire can be seen on the\nseveral swanky extensions on the build-ing.\nI always try to draw in something more\nsombre on my trips, and the Anne Frank\nHouse is definitely one of the more positive such places that I\u2019ve visited. While\nit is certainly terrible to contemplate the\nfate of those hiding in the secret annex,\nOtto Frank\u2019s legacy can be seen through\nthe museum\u2019s positive efforts to combat\nmodern day anti-Semitism and similar\nissues, rather than dwelling on the unchangeable past alone.\nAll in all a fantastic trip, and my only\ncriticism of the Dutch would be the total lack of inventiveness when naming\nthings: the Old Church, New Church,\nNational Monument? It all seems a little\nnewspeak to me, but hey. The Dutch are\ncertainly a liberal and forward-thinking\npeople who have a great perspective or\ntwo to share with us.\nthe canals to aid merchants in shifting\nstock inside without smashing windows.\nTourists love to piss all over the city,\nor so I\u2019m told. In retaliation the nooks\nand crannies of many buildings now\ncome equipped with \u2018pee deflectors\u2019,\nto discourage urinating in such a fash-ion. This devalues the attractiveness\nof buildings but at least saves them\n\u201cTourists love to piss\nall over the city...\nI personally blame\ngod\u201d\nWho cycles along a snow-saturated road after a coffeeshop visit? Natural selection at work...\nThat ambient, crimson glow. Inviting, isn\u2019t it?\nPrefer the photo above? You\u2019re a bad, bad woman\n\n"

The Senate, which is made up\nof senior members of College management, including the Rector, failed to support the paper\nto the disappointment of students who assembled outside the meeting at the Rector\u2019s house.\nHowever pressure has continued to build as\nMustafa Djamgoz, a Professor of Cancer Biology at Imperial and Chair of the Science\nCouncil at the College of Medicine, warned\nthat the cuts could cause \u201clong-term damage\u201d\nand Union President Alex Kendall told Imperial College Union Council that he felt that the\nDepartment was \u201clying\u201d about the effect of the\ncuts on teaching.\nIn his harshest criticism yet of the restruc-ture, Alex Kendall said that the Department\nwere being underhand by not being forthcoming with evidence for the restructure and that\n\u201cif they have evidence [that shows that teaching will be unaffected] but they don\u2019t send it\nto you, then they\u2019re lying\u201d. He also said that\nthe Department have no plan regarding teaching and that they are \u201cjust making it up as they\ngo along\u201d. The Department has previously said\nthat it will carry out a teaching review this\nmonth, following the restructure. The Head\nof the Life Sciences Department Professor Ian\nOwens was unavailable for comment.\nAround 160 students held a noisy but peaceful protest outside the Senate meeting. Many\nwore red monkey masks and chanted \u201cSave our\nplants!\u201d as members of the Senate arrived for\nthe meeting. There was light security outside\nthe meeting but they were content to simply\nwatch from a distance. Professor Owens did\nnot face the students outside the Rector\u2019s house\nand was not present at the meeting. A number\nof staff observed from the back of the crowd,\nincluding some who are directly affected by\nthe cuts.\nDespite the protest, however, College Senate was supportive of the cuts and rejected the\nUnion paper calling for them to be halted. Only\n7 members of the Senate supported the paper\nincluding the College Tutor Mrs Margaret Cunningham, Dr W Thomas Pike and Dr Krysia\nBroda from the Faculty of Engineering, Dr Tim\nAlbrecht from the Faculty of Natural Sciences\nand Dr Michael McGarvey from the Faculty of\nMedicine. The crowd booed and jeered when\nthe result was received via text from Alex Kendall and threatened that they would make their\ndissatisfaction obvious when the National Student Survey came around. Kendall expressed\nhis frustration at the outcome saying, \u201cThe\nmeeting was a massive disappointment. Most\npeople in the room avoided the issue outright.\nThe Senate is supposed to be concerned with\neducation but there was little sign of that at the\nmeeting.\u201d He promised to continue to campaign against the cuts warning, \u201cthere are still\nmany opportunities to fight these changes and\nwe\u2019re not going to give up.\u201d He expressed his\ngratitude to the students at the protest saying\nthat he was \u201cincredibly moved to see that many\npeople out in the rain, campaigning to defend\nteaching at Imperial.\u201d\nMore recently, Kendall produced a list of steps\nthe Union can take in pressing the issue further.\nThese include: putting pressure on the department to release a plan detailing how the teaching hours of the lost staff will be replaced; taking\npart in the forthcoming departmental teaching\nreview; scrutinising the changes made to the\nfinal year Biology and Biochemistry courses;\ngenerating wider awareness about the handling\nof the restructure and the angry response of the\nstudents. The restructure was the subject of a\nrecent article in national magazine Private Eye.\nThe Department has defended its decision\narguing that there is a pressing need to address its deficit. Imperial College London removed \u00a3635,000 in funding this year as part\nof its College-wide decision to withdraw the\nso-called \u2018Flexibility Margin\u2019. The aim is to\n\u201cencourage Departments develop alternative\nplans for financial sustainability\u201d. As a result\nthe Department of Life Sciences has a \u00a31.5 million deficit for the period 2010/2011. The Department claims that \u201cthe proposals would lead\nto a significant improvement in [its] financial\nposition\u201d in a time period of approximately two\nyears. It was revealed in December that Imperial\u2019s operating surplus, or profit, for 2010 was\n\u00a341.3 million, compared with \u00a316.7 million in\n2009 and \u00a327.1 million in 2008.\nHowever yet more academics have come out\nagainst the cuts in what is a growing sign of\ndiscontent amongst both affected and unaffected staff. Professor Mustafa Djamgoz joins\npublic criticism from Emeritus Professor John\nMansfield and Dr Pietro Spanu in a letter to Ian\nOwens that has been made public. In it Professor Djamgoz says that \u201cmany of those \u2018remaining [\u2026] are unhappy with what\u2019s happening\u201d.\nHe explains his initial reluctance to air his discontent publicly but says, \u201cI have thought a lot\nabout the [\u2026] restructuring. There are many\nthings that just do not add up\u201d.\nAcademics from other institutions have\nalso joined the chorus of criticism aimed at\nthe department. Regius Professor of Botany\nand Head of Plant Sciences at University of\nGlasgow, Professor Mike Blatt, slammed the\nrestructure in a letter to Ian Owens and Maggie Dallman, writing that it \u201cdoes not conform\nwith any obvious policy of supporting academic excellence and international competi-tiveness, nor does it show evidence of strategic\nlong-term vision, and it appears certain to send\nall the wrong messages to both staff and students alike. In short, it is virtually guaranteed\nto undermine the reputation and therefore the\nfuture of Imperial College\u201d. Additionally The\nDirector of the John Innes Centre, Professor\nDale Sanders, criticized the cuts saying that\nthey would \u201cexacerbate the shortage of well-educated and motivated graduates\u201d.\nAcademics from a range of universities including Edinburgh, UCL, Durham, Glasgow,\nYork, Reading, Lancaster, St Andrews, Oxford\nand Cambridge have signed the online petition\nwhich now has over 1700 signatures. One of\nthe signatories, Dr John P. Carr of the Cambridge Plant Sciences Department, described\nthe cuts as \u201ctantamount to intellectual vandalism\u201d and called it a \u201cridiculous step for one of\nthe world\u2019s major research universities\u201d. He\nexpressed his anger about the issue saying,\n\u201cstudents have basically been tricked into doing courses and PhDs that they wouldn\u2019t have\ndone if they had known about the restructure\u201d.\nFrom a research point of view, he added, \u201cImperial\u2019s action is absurd when both the Royal\nSociety and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) feel\nthat [crop science] research is vital for UK\nand world food security.\u201d The Royal SociUnion President\npromises to\ncontinue Life\nSciences fight\nWho says protests need to be all about violence a\na party. And yes, before you ask, he did play Rage\nAwards\nNew Years Honours\nThree past and present Imperial College London staff\nhave been recognised in the Queen\u2019s New Year\u2019s\nHonours List for 2011.\nLinda Jones \u2013 Faculty Projects Manager (Natural\nSciences) and Operations Manager (Department of\nPhysics).\nLindsay Green \u2013 Administrative Director at the Medical Research Council\u2019s Clinical Sciences Centre.\nDavid Gentry \u2013 the former Safety Manager in the Faculty of Natural Sciences.\nThey all received a Member of the Order of the British\nEmpire (MBE) for services to Science.\nSeveral Imperial Alumni were also recognised with\nHonours:\nKnighthood\nSir Ron Kerr, St Mary\u2019s\nSchool for Medicine, for\nservices to Healthcare\nOBE\nVictor Leverett, BSc\nPhysics 1966, for services to the Defence\nIndustry\nAndrew Goldberg, St\nMary\u2019s 1994, for services to Medicine\nCBE\nProfessor Hugh Godfray, PHd Biology 1982, for services to Science\nPeter Head, Arup, BSc Civil Engineering 1969, for\nservices to Civil Engineering and to the environment\nProfessor Stephen Holgate, Medicine 1971, for services to Clinical Science\nJenny Body, Aeronautics 1975, for services to the\nAerospace Industry and to Engineering\nMBE\nDr Elizabeth Hall, St Mary\u2019s 1961, for services to\nHealthcare and to the community in Colchester, Essex.\nDavid Mitchell-Baker, Engineering 1959, for services to the community in Mid-Surrey.\nMs Dorothy Fairburn, Wye Natural Sciences 1973,\nfor services to Rural Affairs in the Yorkshire and\nHumber Region.\nThe Honours list has, in the past, often been marred\nwith controversy.

Avid Inception fans will immediately\nthink back to the object with which Dom Cobb\ndifferentiates between the real and the imagi-nary. Did it or did it not stop spinning? That\nis the question. For other Londoners, how-ever, Totem signifies the latest touring Cirque\ndu Soleil show at the Royal Albert Hall. I was\nlucky enough to win a pair of tickets for the\nshow\u2019s premiere on January 5th and, although\nI failed to rub shoulders with the celebrities in\nthe stalls, I was blown away by the tremendous\nperformance.\nThe show is billed as a \u201cfascinating journey\ninto the evolution of mankind.\u201d Take a scientist who mimics Darwin with his hairy beard, a\nfew impressively lifelike monkeys, add an Italian buffoon in extra skimpy swim shorts and\nyou\u2019ve got the basics of the story. Well, sort\nof. But all that doesn\u2019t matter because nobody\nhonestly goes to the Cirque du Soleil for the\nplot. Death defying acrobatics, innovative live\nmusic, eye-catching costumes and very bright\nM.A.C. sponsored face make-up; that\u2019s what\nit\u2019s all about.\nThe show begins with an enormous turtle\nshell shaped web \u2013 complete with amphibian-like acrobats who throw themselves around\nthe bars to the approving \u201coohs\u201d and \u201caahs\u201d\nof the audience \u2013 and \u2018Mr. Sparkle\u2019, as I liked\nto call him, suspended from the ceiling of the\nRoyal Albert Hall in the sparkly-est, glittery-est sequined bodysuit I had ever seen. Spinning\naway above our heads, with the light bouncing\noff his suit all around the vast room, he certainly added a touch of glamour to the occasion.\nOh, it was beautiful.\nHighlights - there were many - included a\nNative American duo that performed gravity-defying tricks whilst rotating at around 100\nmph on a platform that was, quite simply, too\nsmall to be safe. Think Pocahontas, but on\nadrenaline. The motion of hands moving to\ncover open mouths was reserved for one of my\nfavourite acts of the night, the \u2018Lovebirds\u2019, a\nduo of Canadian trapeze artists who challenged\nthe norms seen in your standard Russian or\nChinese circus acts. The act plays with clumsy\nshapes (that have been rehearsed to perfection)\nand transitions that make the duo appear more\nNakotah Raymond Larance as the \u2018Hoop Dancer\u2019. Pretty unimaginative name if you ask me...\nDana Li\n\u201cThink Pocahontas, but\non adrenaline\u201d\nlike one single entity \u2013 all whilst being suspended high off the ground. At one moment,\nthe guy even hung from the trapeze with a part\nof the body that is not made for hanging: his\nneck. No wire suspension, no, none of those\nsafety precautions at all. I couldn\u2019t believe my\nlittle Chinese eyes.\nCompared with such greatness, however,\nsome acts appeared rather lacklustre. The scientist\u2019s (Greg Kennedy) conic juggling with\nnine neon glow balls in a massive funnel managed to emulate physics through patterning, but\nwas hardly riveting. And the man who bounced\na ping pong ball off his head, shoulders, hands,\ntoes\u2026 yawn.\nAt the end, the circus acts gather one final\ntime to perform a dance that has elements of\nBhangra. It was a refreshing approach to bidding adieu and my palms glowed scarlet red\nfrom excessively clapping such a brilliant\npremiere. Cirque du Soleil once again revives\nthe classical circus show and reminds us that,\nsometimes, the wonders at which we all marvel\nneed not be a giant leap in science, but simply\nthe human body pushing the limits of what we\nbelieve to be possible.\nTotem by Cirque du Soleil is on at the Royal Albert Hall until 17th February\nModern British Sculpture\nThe Wizard of Oz\nImperial\u2019s secret Arts\u2019 students\nThe blockbuster art show of the term, the RA is\nknown for its big-hitters and this is an epic retrospective of 20th Century British sculpture with\nloads of big names.\n22nd January-7th April, Royal Academy\nA classic story at the National Theatre, directed by\nDanny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) and co-starring\nBenedict Cumberbatc.

According to A\nChristmas Carol, it is a time when rich\npeople should have been kind and generous to the poor as, statistically at least;\nmany of them are people too!\nBut social contact and friendly manner\nis, like, so pre-internet. Luckily we have\nThe Christmas Sales\u2122 (TCS) instead\nto act as a once-yearly border crossing\nbetween the tiers of society, without the\nneed for anything as embarrassing as\ntalking with posh folk or as potentially\ndisease-catching as mixing with the\npoor. Boxing day is for (wo)men of all\ncolours, creed and class to queue up as\nequals; equally desperate for deals and,\nsuddenly, equally able to afford them.\nIndeed, if A Christmas Carol was set\nnowadays Tiny Tim would never have\nthe chance to die from hunger and sick-liness. He\u2019d die from being an over-fed\nfatso gagging on all the cut-price mince\npies selling like hot-cakes (also on offer)\nin Sainsbury\u2019s after chrimbo. He probably wouldn\u2019t even be called \u2018Tiny\u2019 as\nRhys Davies\nthere\u2019s only so much irony allowed on\ntombstones. But he\u2019d die happy, gorging\non the finest Taste the Difference pies\nand loving every morsel of difference\nhe tasted.\nOh Truck-like Tim how I can relate\nto thee! Are there any greater joys of a\nmodern existence than stumbling across\ntop deals in the Reduced Price food section of a supermarket? And unlike the\nshort-lived high of TCS\u2122, it is a pleasure that remains throughout the year:\nCheap offers are for life, not just for\nChristmas.\nBut some people are blind to the power\nof those small yellow labels, taking just\na cursory look at what is on offer and,\nworse; only looking out for the random\nfreak occurrence that something on their\nusual shopping list has been reduced.\nThis is the grocery equivalent of being\noffered cut-price flights to Fiji, but leaving them because they aren\u2019t \u2018Costa Del\nSol like you\u2019re used to\u2019.\nInstead, one should appreciate that\nhumble reduction-sticker-gun for what it\nreally is, a hole-punch for social groups,\ncreating little portals through which drop\nreduced-price consumables from entirely different lives. I would never have\ntried Irish Soda Bread if I had not seen\nit stickered in a Sainsbury\u2019s aisle, nor\nPotato Farls if I hadn\u2019t spied them cheap\nin Tesco. I\u2019d never have ponced about\nlike some chocolate aficionado whilst\nmunching on my G\u00fc torte, nor would I\nhave been sorely disappointed by those\ntrendy Covent Garden soups that had\nalways tempted me with their homely,\nwholesome packaging. Bizarre bakery\nblooms, gluten-free peanut squares or\nsoya milk chocolate milkshakes, all have\nbeen little tastes of other price-ranges,\nlands or incurable chronic bowel condi-tions. Each one allows me a little bit of\nrole play, whether stepping into the shoes\nof a Ryvita\u2013buying yummy mummy or\nthe (frankly tasteless) microwave crab\nready meal of some time-pressed urban\nyuppie. Each one has been a culinary\neducation and often, a pleasant surprise.\nDo not be disheartened this year if you\ndon\u2019t get that jacket you wanted in the\nTCS\u2122. All year round we are blessed\nby big corporations and a Santa\u2019s sack\nload of gifts and goodies for us little\npeople.\nThank you Tesco.\nH\nappy New Year to you\nall! It\u2019s nice to know that,\nas a species, we\u2019ve managed to make it through\nanother year without destroying ourselves. Well done.\nThere can be no doubt now that we are\nliving in the future. We have, by some\npeople\u2019s (anachronistic) standards, supercomputers that we can carry in our\npockets; for food, we have nutritious\nand delicious meals that can be reconstituted in an instant; for entertainment,\nwe can watch programmes in greater\nresolutions and in more dimensions than\nexist in real life.\nBut there\u2019s still one thing I want to\nknow: Where\u2019s my jet\u2013pack?\nThis is most definitely the future.\nWe\u2019re ten years from a Space Odyssey\nand fourteen years on from when Skynet\ntook over the world (that was a particularly bad day). We are currently living in\nthe middle of a science\u2013fiction writer\u2019s\nfantasies. So why doesn\u2019t it feel like the\nfuture?\nI think it\u2019s partly due to the past/pre-sent only becoming the future very in-sidiously, creeping up so slowly that we\ndon\u2019t notice. We\u2019re surrounded by so\nmany amazing innovations and inventions that arrived so gradually we don\u2019t\nrealise how amazing they actually are.\nOmar Hafeez-Bore\nBut this doesn\u2019t feel like the future\nbecause we\u2019re also missing some essen-tials. We have lasers, sure, but they\u2019ve\nyet to trickle down to the man on the\nstreet, and just where are the robots?! I\ncan see how these things could be used\nfor less\u2013than\u2013benign purposes and with\nhumanity\u2019s collective propensity to, as\nGandhi put it, be a dick \u2013 something, I\nfear, that won\u2019t change in 2011 \u2013 I think\nwe might be better off without them for\nthe time being.\nBut jet\u2013packs are all right. In fact,\nthey\u2019re better than all right, they\u2019re really cool! Admit it. Who hasn\u2019t dreamt\nof flying through the skies like a bird,\nlaughing at the puny mortals down be-low? Mwahaha!\nMegalomania aside, they would offer\nyet another mode to commute to college \u2013 this would be especially pertinent\nwhen the Tube goes on strike... again.\nPerhaps most important of all, the skies\nare the one place you are guaranteed to\nbe safe from the commuter\u2019s deadliest\npredator, the leopards.\nWithout jet-packs, we might as well\nbe living in the past, which from the future\u2019s perspective is the present, where\nmost people think we\u2019re living already.\nSuch a shame, but who knows \u2013 maybe\n2011 will be the year of the jet\u2013pack?\nI can only dream.\nI\nwould also like to take this opportunity to respond to Jamie Henry\u2019s\nresponse to one of my letters last\nterm. Mr Henry was upset by some of\nmy remarks on the St. John Ambulance.\nHe found my remarks to be in poor humour and I\u2019m sorry that he thinks that.\nBut that letter, as is most of what I\nwrite, was intended to be humorous. It is\nimpossible to amuse all the people all of\nthe time and I apologise if I have missed\na beat, as it were.\nHowever, I will reiterate the tone of\nthat letter, one I feel I made transparently clear, that the SJA do provide a\nfantastic service and, as a keen runner for charity, I am grateful for their\npresence.\nWhile people fear illness and injury,\nsome fear doctors, and by extension,\nthe SJA, far more. Illogical I know, but\nthis is the fear I was relating to in my\nletter.\nOnce again, Mr. Henry, I am sorry if\nI have offended you (or anyone else)\nwith my letter. My intention has only\never been to be lightly humorous. I\nhope this response goes some ways towards making amends.\nP.S. Please don\u2019t call me Mr. Davies.\nIt makes me sound like a Physics teach-er, a misconception I would hate to\nperpetuate.\n2011:ASpace Odyssey... I wish\n\u201cAre there any\ngreater joys of a\nmodern existence\nthan the Reduced\nPrice section of a\nsupermarket?\u201d\nLife Sciences must\nchange, not chop\nCut-price foods make me happy\nI was impressed with the way\nthe Life Sciences cuts issue\nwas reported in Felix last term.\nI am no journalist, I prefer to\nbeat them than join them, as a\nrule, but I was impressed with\nthe way it confronted the issue\nhead on, as good journalism\nshould.\nVarious people have described the cuts to Life Sciences and damaging and un-necessary. This I agree with.\nWhen a Head of Department\nis left with a hole the size of\nthe Lehmann Brothers in his\nbudget, it seems a bit rummy\nfor teaching staff to be comprehensively shat on in order\nto make up the difference. I\nam not going to say I feel sorry\nfor this HoD for the decision\nhe must make, these sorts of\nthings were part of what middle and senior management is\nlike.\nSo \u2013 we have a budgetary\ncock-up and staff we do not\nwant to lose. What do we do?\nThere are various possible actions \u2013 cut the pay of all academic staff by perhaps \u00a35k/\nannum. This, for those who\ndo not watch \u2018Yes, Prime minister\u2019 is also known as \u2018Politician\u2019s logic\u2019. Something must\nbe done, this is something,\ntherefore we must do it. Sound\nabout right for the current\nproposals?\nI hope that the senior management in Life Sciences studied natural selection, so they\nmight be able to see where this\nargument is going \u2013 perhaps\nthey should attend the lectures\ngiven by the teaching staff they\nwant to axe, while they still\ncan. Academics, just like everyone else, need to move with\nthe times, need to evolve and\nimprove. This does not need\nto be cutting away prime flesh.\nIronically I happen to know\nthat several of those whom\nthey want to axe are aware of\nthis need to modernise, and\nhave actively tried to bring this\nabout.\nI don\u2019t think I need to tell\nyou that I think this proposed\nrestructure is all wrong, but\nnow perhaps we have a constructive basis for a different\nway of tackling the underlying\nproblems. These cuts are not\nthe only option.\nSamuel Furse\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\n\u201cBut there\u2019s still one\nthing I want to know:\nwhere\u2019s my jet\u2013\npack?\u201d\nFriday 14 january 2011\n\n"

Griffon Studios, which\ncharges \u00a3235 per week for high-quality\nstudio apartments, is the product of a\njoint venture between the Imperial College Fund and the property developer\nBerkeley First. The halls on Winstanley\nRoad, which include a 24-hour \u201cconcierge service\u201d and a free on-site \u201cfitness gym\u201d, will house 452 postgraduates from October 2011, expanding to\n566 the following year.\nJohn Anderson, the Chief Executive\nOfficer of the College Fund, said that the\nproject was part of the College\u2019s long-term strategy to grow its endowment\nfund. \u201cWe\u2019ve got around 5,500 post-graduates, most of whom are currently\nrenting in the private market, either\nwith private landlords or private halls. It\nmakes financial sense, where the fundamentals of the market support it, for us\nto offer an alternative to these students.\u201d\nThe College Fund has committed to\ninvest up to \u00a37 million into Winstanley\n2, the Special Purpose Vehicle \u2013 or subsidiary company \u2013 created to develop the\nsite. MrAnderson told Felix that the College fund expects \u201ca 15% return per annum on the equity invested by the Fund.\u201d\nThe Graduate Schools Association\n(GSA), which represents postgraduate\nstudents at Imperial, said that the price\nof the studios was \u201ca bit steep\u201d. GSA\nChair Deena Blumenkratz told Felix\nthat there needed to be an extra effort to\nbuild the community at Griffon Studios\nto justify the cost but that the promise\nof \u201ca wide range of social, sporting and\ncultural events throughout the year\u201d\ngave her \u201chigh hopes\u201d for the new halls.\nShe added that the GSA would be carrying out a survey \u201cto find out if postgraduate students think the accommodation\nis affordable.\u201d\nMr Anderson defended the high-cost\nof the studios saying, \u201cWe\u2019re offering\na high-quality product at the upper end\nof the price scale \u2013 although we believe\nthat we\u2019re offering a lower-than-market\nprice for that product.\u201d He said that the\nnew halls were upmarket because of the\nCollege Fund\u2019s partnership with Berkeley and because he believed that it was\nthe right quality of accommodation for\nImperial postgraduates: \u201cWe have gone\ndown this route, firstly, because [\u2026]\nthe landowners Berkeley [\u2026] are involved in high-quality accommodation\nand, secondly, because we\u2019ve identified\nthat this is an appropriate level of quality for Imperial postgraduate students.\u201d\nHowever, he denied that the halls were\nbeyond the needs of Imperial students:\n\u201cIt\u2019s not luxurious, certainly not, but we\nare interested in giving postgraduate students the best experience possible while\nthey\u2019re at Imperial.\u201d\nHe went on to say that providing more\naffordable postgraduate accommodation\nwasn\u2019t currently possible, arguing that\nthe correct conditions \u201csimply aren\u2019t\nsatisfied in West London at the moment\u201d. He denied that there was a demand for lower-quality, low-cost postgraduate accommodation: \u201cIf I could\nfind a low-cost site, with a low-cost developer within easy commuting distance\nof South Kensington and I felt there was\na strong demand for lower-quality, low-cost postgraduate accommodation then\nof course I would love to do that\u201d\nThe Director of Commercial Services,\nJane Neary, said that the pricing of the\nrooms was a matter for the College Fund\nand emphasised that the project was a\nbusiness venture: \u201cThis is a business\nopportunity for the College Fund.

She said, \u201c[The end\nuser] will be international students.\nThe people who were really interested\nat the postgraduate open day were the\ninternational postgraduates. [For home\npostgraduates] there\u2019s probably a sense\nof the cost. They are probably a little\nhappier in knowing what areas to live in\n[and need] less support.\u201d\nMr Anderson argued that the halls\noffered international postgraduate students peace of mind when it came to\nhousing: \u201cThe \u00a3235 price tag is not simply for the bricks and mortar. It\u2019s also\nfor the amenities, the community spirit\nand for peace of mind. We know that\ninternational postgraduate students can\nsometimes get burnt in the private rental\nmarket.\u201d\nThe College Fund has entered into a\n15-year rental guarantee agreement with\nBerkeley First, which is worth approximately \u00a36.25 million per year in 2011.\nThis means that it has committed to fill\n97% of the studios at \u00a3232 per week. Mr\nAnderson said that the College would\nseek to fill the rooms with postgraduates\nfrom other London universities if they\nwere unable to attract enough Imperial\npostgraduates. He added, however, that\nit would likely be at a \u201chigher price than\nfor Imperial students.\u201d\nA club trip took a turn for the worse last\nNovember when a member of the Outdoor Club fell 100ft while climbing in\nthe Lake District. The injured student\nwas winter climbing on the slopes of\nHelvellyn, the third highest peak in England, with a small group of other Imperial students on the 27th of November\nwhen the incident occurred.\nA passerby was able to contact Patterdale Mountain Rescue and the student,\nwho had suffered a broken femur, was\nairlifted to safety by a Royal Navy Sea\nKing helicopter to a hospital in Whitehaven.\nA spokesperson for Imperial College\nUnion (ICU) confirmed the incident,\npraising the action that the group took:\n\u201cThe incident occurred\u2026 while climbing a winter grade II snow slope. During\nthe climb the student in question took a\nfall, sliding down the slope and coming\nto a halt. When the incident occurred the\ngroup dealt with it appropriately, rendering help from other people climbing in\nthe area and calling the local mountain\nrescue team\u2026 ICU are grateful to the\nothers climbing in the area that day, and\nthe volunteers of the Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team for their assistance.\nAll reporting procedures were followed\ncorrectly.\u201d\nThe spokesman added that \u201cthe group\nwere skilled, experienced and equipped\nappropriately for the conditions and activities being undertaken.\u201d\nHowever, an eyewitness to the incident disputes this claim. Rebecca\nWaugh, the individual who contacted\nMountain Rescue, criticised the climbers in a forum post on ukclimbing.com,\nclaiming that the group was \u201ccompletely\nunprepared for a day out on the hill\u201d.\nShe listed multiple complaints about\nthe group such as there being \u201cno suitably experienced or qualified leader, no\ncharged up mobile phones, no decent\nhead torches, unsuitable footwear, broken crampons hanging off their belt-loops, unsuitable clothing incorrectly\nfitting harnesses and no emergency shelter\u201d.\nShe also described seeing the student\nfall from \u201cthe top of Helvelyn Head\nWall onto the rocks below\u201d and how\nthey feared that the student had died:\n\u201c[we made our way] to what we thought\nwould be a dead body.\u201d\nWhen contacted by Felix about her\npost, Ms. Waugh was keen to state that\nthe complaints were not \u201ca dig at the\nclub or the persons in general\u201d but instead aimed to highlight \u201cthe unique\nposition that University clubs find themselves in\u201d.\nShe went on to argue that said clubs\nsuffer from \u201cskill shortages due to a\nnumber of factors such as age and experience of members, skill drain resulting from members leaving after a few\nyears, financial constraints and a lack of\nknowledge with regards to the correct\nusage of kit, clothing and equipment.\u201d\nThe ICU spokesman responded to\nthese claims, stating that \u201cmembers of\nthe public are entitled to their own opinions and are free to post their views on\nonline forums.\u201d\nRobin Jones, Chairman of the Outdoor\nClub, declined to comment on either the\nincident or the claims against the individuals involved.\nThis type of situation is not unheard of\namongst Imperial\u2019s societies. In February 2010, Felix reported on a member of\nImperial College Mountaineering Club\nwho also fell 100ft while climbing in\nNorth Wales.\nTom Welch\nMatthew Colvin\nI think the sheep are watching us...\nThe showroom beside the Queens Tower: the perfect place to crash if\nyou\u2019re studying late in the library\nKadhim Shubber\n\u201cWe know that international postgraduate\nstudents can sometimes get burnt in the\nprivate rental market.\u201d\nFriday 14 january 2011\n\n"

The new standards\nfor wireless communication are\nmeant as an upgrade from current third generation (3G) technologies in use\ntoday, and promise higher speeds for users and\nbetter efficiency for telecom companies. Yet is\nit worth shelling out for these new handsets,\nand if so, what can you expect?\nAs far as Britain goes, we are going to have\nto wait until at least mid-late 2011 before the\ngovernment auctions the required spectrum\nallocated to 4G, to telephone providers. This\nmeans that even though you may be able to get\nyour hands on a phone that\u2019s capable of connecting to a 4G network, it\u2019s likely that it won\u2019t\nget the chance to use them until sometime in\n2012 at the earliest.\nIn addition, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that\nmany phone manufacturers have been less than\nscrupulous about what they call 4G. There are\nquite a few examples of the 4G moniker being\nused interchangeably between meaning those\nthat actually satisfy 4G standards and those\nthat attain 4G-like speeds. HSPDA+ for example is an extension of current 3G tech, but\nreaches much higher 4G-like speeds.\nIf you\u2019re willing to wait a year to benefit from\nit, 4G tech could provide you with a seamless\nand lightning quick internet experience. Just\ndon\u2019t expect the battery life to be stellar.\nFree App of the Week\niOS - Kindle for iPhone\nAmazon\u2019s Kindle app for the iPhone means you\u2019re\nnever without a good book. Featuring Whisper Sync,\nyou can keep your place no matter what.\n4G or not: does it really mean anything?\nKindle on Android brings Amazon\u2019s eBook might to\nGoogle\u2019s mobile OS, ready for books and magazines.\nJust try not to squint too much at the screen.\nAndroid - Kindle for Android\nCES 2011 - Las Vegas\nFeroz Salam brings you the best from this year\u2019s CES,\nthe world\u2019s largest consumer electronics exhibition\nT\nablets were the name of the game\nat this year\u2019s CES, continuing\nthe trend towards portability over\nfrom last year. In contrast to 2010\nhowever, major manufacturers are\nno longer playing second fiddle to Apple, with\nthe definite emergence of a breed of devices\nthat could (in several ways) surpass Apple\u2019s\niPad.\nLeading the charge is Motorola\u2019s Xoom (pre-viewed on the next page), featuring a powerful\ndual core processor and the highly awaited Android Honeycomb tablet-oriented OS.\nIt\u2019s not all smooth sailing though, as the\nXoom is facing credible competition from the\nlikes of RIM, with its business oriented first\nforay, the PlayBook, and established players\nsuch as Samsung, who have taken a leaf from\nthe mobile market and previewed an innovative\nbut risky, slider-tablet that opens out to a full\nQWERTY keyboard.\nWith nearly 100 tablets announced or previewed over four days, there\u2019s going to be plenty to choose from, but with promises made by\nmost tablet manufacturers from 2010 (notably\nthe Windows 7 tablet debacle) left unfulfilled,\nand Apple\u2019s rumoured second generation iPad\non the way, it might be worth waiting to see\nsome slates hit the stores before setting your\nmoney aside.\nTablets, tablets, tablets\nE\nvery year, the CES exhibition out\nin the deserts of Las Vegas promises an interesting foresight into\nthe gadgets and technologies that\nare going to be big over the year,\nand this year was no exception. While this\nyear\u2019s CES continued where the last exhibition\nleft off, focusing on handheld and mobile computing platforms (think tablets, tablets, tablets),\nthere was still plenty of novelty on offer as\nmanufacturers attempted to pack even more\npower into the palm of your hand.\nOn the mobile front, manufacturers are obviously hoping that this is to be the year that\n4G makes it big, with major investments in\nnext-generation devices from big players in the\nmarket such as LG, Motorola, HTC and Sony.\nAndroid too shows clear signs of consolidating\non its major successes over the previous year,\nwith the new Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) or Android 2.2 (Froyo) featuring on the vast majority\nof devices.\nWhile these high-end devices promise bleed-ing-edge performance, you might want to wait\na while before investing in a brand spanking\nnew 4G handset \u2013 the public auction for the 4G\nspectrum to British mobile operators is only\nscheduled to happen in 2011.\nAndroid also made a showing in the burgeoning tablet market, with the tablet-oriented\nAndroid 3.0, aka Honeycomb, finally making\na showing on some devices. News on tablets\nwas dominated by the usual mobile computing\nsuspects, and the biggest splash was made by\nMotorola with their new 10.1 inch Xoom de-vice. Running Honeycomb, the device packs a\nheavy punch in the processor department and is\nalready setting itself up to be yet another \u2018iPad\nkiller\u2019. Read on for more about the Xoom, and\nthe other biggest stories that we\u2019ve picked\nout from a week chock full of new product\nannouncements.\n12\n\u201cThere was plenty\nof novelty on offer\nas manufacturers\nattempted to pack even\nmore power into the\npalm of your hand\u201d\nFriday 14 January 2011\nWhen I was your age, we only have half\na G!

SouthEnd\nhave also been very careful to make sure that il-omilo never becomes disorientating \u2013 as Ilo and\nMilo stand on opposite sides of the same platform with a general ignorance of any applicable\nlaws of physics, it\u2019s a testament to the design\nthat the human brain can still even understand\nwho is where and what needs to be moved how.\nThe game is also gorgeous to look at; the surroundings to each level are packed with other\nWeb Games\nEach week we\u2019re going to bring you a selection of\nfresh, free and fun web games that you can play right\naway in your browser. Unless otherwise specified,\nyou\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player plug-in\nwhich can be installed from http://get.adobe.com/\nflashplayer/.\nEffing Meteors\njiggmin.com\nIn this abstract action game, you control a (deep\nbreath, physicists) \u2018gravity well\u2019 with which you can\ntrap meteors and send them hurtling towards planets in balls of fire. The aim of the game is simple:\nwipe out as many species as you can. Each species\nbehaves differently and you must adjust your tactics\naccordingly to beat them.\nAs the game continues in this fashion you\u2019ll encounter aliens, missile-shooting snails and oversized, radioactive dinosaurs. Mindless destruction turns out\nto be a lot of fun, and the game\u2019s unique visual style\nlooks great. You can spend five minutes of half an\nhour here and still have an enjoyable time!\nD\nespite sounding like the name\nof the trendiest new cocktail to\nhit London bars, or perhaps the\nlocation of the latest hit tourist spot in the Balkans, ilomilo\nis in fact the latest arcade game from Swedish\ngame house SouthEnd Interactive. Ilo and Milo\nare the protagonists: little egg-shaped blobs of\nfur (with inevitable cute little faces and arms,\nof course) that somehow keep losing each\nother amongst the crazy floating world they\ninhabit. The player\u2019s task is simple: reunite\nthem! You control one of the pair at a time,\nmoving around, picking up blocks and switching between to the other at will. Action takes\nplace on floating levels of cubes suspended in\ncrazy, cute worlds where gravity and physics\nare seemingly disregarded in favour of gravity-reversing trapdoors, a strange creature addicted\nto apples and a little man who rides a beetle. Or\npossibly a flying dog.\nPuzzles make up the core of the game and\nthankfully it\u2019s the thing that ilomilo does best.\nIlo and Milo will often appear on different\nplatforms and at different angles to each other,\nand helping them to meet can only be achieved\nthrough a subtle use of the moveable blocks\nand the physics-defying \u2018carpets\u2019 that swap the\nlittle protagonists between different sides of the\ncubes they\u2019re standing on. Working out what to\ndo to reunite the two titular characters is a lot\nof fun, and it\u2019s certainly satisfying when a well-formulated plan comes to fruition. However,\neven though it\u2019s doesn\u2019t take long to figure out\nwhat to do, the levels can still take a fair while\nto complete \u2013 mainly due to having to go back\nand forth to move blocks \u2013 which sometimes\ngets a tiny bit tedious.\nIt\u2019s clear that particular attention has been\npaid to helping players to grasp what\u2019s going on\nand understand new concepts, which is something that makes ilomilo a particularly relaxing\n(rather than the usual frustrating) puzzle game.\nThe level design is exemplary as it introduces\nnew concepts in a fantastically intuitive way\nthat stops new blocks and the gravity-bending\nlevels from getting too confusing. Someone\nwho catches on quickly will definitely find the\nfirst chapter a bit of a slow start, but the levels\nget more difficult later on and the bonus levels,\nwhich are unlocked after collecting enough of\nthe mini-lookalikes in the story levels, provide\na serious challenge simply through their scale\neven for an experienced puzzler. Later levels are also kept fresh by the addition of new\nblocks and \u2018enemies\u2019, and these aren\u2019t just\ngimmicks \u2013 the new elements are used well and\noften to great effect.\nIndeed, the level design is just one reason that\nilomilo is a technically excellent title. The controls are very intuitive and only very rarely do\neither Ilo or Milo end up doing something that\nthe player didn\u2019t intend. The camera, which is\noften a neglected or rushed element particularly\nin 3D arcade titles, does the job very well. It\u2019s\nalso the little details: when the camera moves\nSimon Worthington reviews new puzzle game ilomilo\n28\nVector Rush\nnewgrounds.com/portal/view/558659\nI\u2019ve never taken acid, but if I did I\u2019m pretty sure this is\nwhat it would look like. Your first reaction on entering\nthis 3D tunnel game will most likely be to scream,\nbut after you\u2019ve calmed down and regained control\nof your bowels this game turns into an adrenaline-pumping trippy monster that is actually incredibly en-joyable. Collect blue rings for extra lives!\nBut for all the great elements to ilomilo, there\nare unfortunately some bad ones. There is the\nclassic \u2018deep and emotional\u2019 indie-style plot\nwhich remains completely detached from the\ngameplay, and its effect on the game is so small\nas to be virtually pointless. Co-op multiplayer\nalso makes an appearance; each player controls\neither llo or Milo but only one is \u2018active\u2019 at\nany time, in a similar way to the single-player\ngame. With no way to control both simulta-neously, all this mode really eliminates is the\nneed to physically pass the controller around.\nCombine this with the fact that there are no\nnew co-op levels \u2013 the single player chapters\nare simply recycled \u2013 and you end up with a coop mode that is entirely a waste of time.\nCo-op also partly fails because there is simply no replay value to ilomilo. The puzzles\naren\u2019t really fun to complete again since most\nof the satisfaction is derived from not knowing\nwhat to do to solve the puzzle. There are bonus items to collect, but it\u2019s perfectly possible\nto get them all the first time you enter a level.\nIndeed, this is certainly a strong point \u2013 you\ncan\u2019t break the levels and no matter how many\nblocks you shuffle around the puzzle will always remain solvable.\nIt cannot be denied that ilomilo is a joy to\nplay. Completing puzzles is irrefutably fun\nand there\u2019s a certain attraction that keeps you\nplaying all the way to the end, with the game\u2019s\ntechnical excellence and cute visuals doing\ntheir most to both help you along and not get in\nyour way. It\u2019s a truth that anyone could pick up\nthis charming arcade title and, despite its flaws,\nthey would almost certainly enjoy it.\nilomilo is available now from SouthEnd\nInteractive and Microsoft Games Studios\nfrom the Xbox Live Marketplace for 800\nMicrosoft Points and on Windows Phone 7\nfor \u00a33.99.\nfloating oddities, like a child\u2019s toy windmill,\nclock towers and even fish, all sewn together\nin a patchwork style that is very reminiscent\nof LittleBigPlanet. More critically, in keeping\nwith the ilomilo ethic, the artwork never gets\nin the way of the puzzles; the different blocks\nand things in the level are on the whole distinguishable from each other. It\u2019s simply there for\nwhen you\u2019re ready to tilt the analogue sticks\nback and take a good long look at the world,\nat which point of course, it comes into its own\nand fits with the rest of the game perfectly.\nCute but still smart\n\u201c\nbeen\nn\nng on\ng on\nome-ome\naxing\naxing\ngame.\ngame.\nduces\nuces\n\u201d\nbloc\nbloc\nway\nway\nIt\nIt\nplay\nplay\nand\nan\nplay\nd\u2019s toy windmill,\nd\u2019s toy windmill,\n\u201cWorking out what to\ndo to reunite the two\ntitular characters is a lot\nof fun, and it\u2019s certainly\nsatisfying when a well-formulated plan comes\nto fruition.\u201d\n\n"

They had Chris locked\nand I should have sailed so that they continue\naround the course or I would overtake them.\nFoolishly I did not do this but sailed right\ninto the lock they had Chris in, allowing their\nboat to overtake both of us. They were now in\n1-2 and promptly sailed off and won. Disappointed by this change of fortune we headed\nin for lunch, expecting to go out again soon.\nThis was delayed by breakages to boats which\ncaused racing to be stopped while they were\nrepaired. Our fifth race eventually started and\ninvolved the most actual team racing of the\nday. I was 1st and Chris 3rd around the first\nmark. Therefore I decide to do a mark trap to\ntry and get Chris past the boat behind. This\nalmost worked as Chris got through. Unfortunately I was also overtaken so we were still\nin 1-3 going down the run. This is a winning\ncombination, however, it is unstable as the opposition can easily use their boat in second to\nattack your boat in third. Therefore Chris set\nup to do another mark trap at mark three. This\nproved unnecessary as the boat in two capsized\nand I was able to sail past. Our final race of the\nday proved another easy win as Chris and I got\n1-2 while Fiona held up to opposition.\nAfter this it was in and time to get changed\nand warmed. Unfortunately due to the numerous delays the round robin was not finished\nfor all teams before it got dark so it was announced that it would complete on Sunday\nmorning. We then headed back to our hosts\nhouse to get ready for the social, which had\nthe theme \u201cWhere\u2019s Wally\u201d. This involved everyone dressing up as Wally except for Chris\nwho was volunteered to be Wanda, who is apparently Wally\u2019s sister. This was quite disturb-ing. The social was a buffet meal followed by\na night at the excellent Cardiff Union. Suffice\nto say I do not remember much of the evening\nbeyond wondering back with Fiona and Iona\nwhen the Union closed, the others had already\nleft. I was just about to get into my sleeping\nbag when a somewhat irate Iona interrupted\nme asking me to get Chris out of her bed.\nWhile hilarious, I can see why she was a bit\nannoyed by this.\nAll too soon Sunday arrived. As we had done\nall our races on Saturday we knew we would\nnot be in the first race, so we had a lie in. Arriving about an hour late I was somewhat concerned to see that racing hadn\u2019t actually started\nyet. I was even more worried that it was even\ncolder than yesterday and in the lighter winds,\nice had formed on the SALT water of Cardiff\nBay. While we waited for the round robin to\nfinish we sat around inside and like good Imperial students either did work or read the maths\nand physics books that we had all brought with\nus.\nEventually the round robin was finished and\nit was announced that the top six teams would\nhave a round robin while the others would do\na winner stays on competition due to lack of\ntime. This was very annoying as the main reason for the lack of time was Cardiff\u2019s slow or-ganisation. We were tied in second with Reading in our flight. This should have put Reading\nthrough on tiebreakers, even more annoying.\nHowever the organisers did it a weird way so\nReading didn\u2019t go through either.\nThis now meant we had to wait even longer\nas we were near the top of the seeding, meaning we weren\u2019t on until the end. Eventually\nwe were sent out only to get onto the floating\npontoon where changeovers were happening\nto find that one of the boats was broken. This\ninvolved more waiting while this problem was\nsorted. Except now we were on a freezing pontoon in the middle of the water. Eventually we\ngot to race which we promptly lost. We were\n4-5-6 by the first mark and a cock up from me,\nnearly taking Fiona out did not help.\nWe then packed up and headed for home. Not\ntoo displeased with our 8th place but feeling we\ncould have done much better. If you\u2019d like to\ncome sailing, we welcome experienced sailors\nand beginners alike.\nSailors search for Wally\n....Continued from Back Page\nImperial Fencing\nkeep their run of\nvictories intact\nIt\u2019s a Saturday morning in Cambridge as Imperial Fencing\u2019s first men\u2019s team arrive at the\nsports venue. Ahead of them lays their first\nBUCS weekend of the year, with matches\nagainst University of Oxford, University of\nCambridge, Bristol University and University\nof London Union (ULU).\nThey\u2019re first up against Oxford, starting with\nfoil. With Chris Gilliam, Robert Shaw and Ed\nCollier on the team, they start fencing an even\nmatch, struggling to keep a few hits lead. Robert unfortunately manages to injure himself\nand is replaced by the reserve Maiyuran Ratneswaran, and despite the accident they win\nwith 4 hits. Whereas the epeeists, Marcello Colombino, Ed Gilhead and Miles Gandolfi, also\nstruggle a bit in their match but win it in the\nend, the sabreurs, Maiyuran, Henry Gann and\nCamille van Hoffelen, show their standard and\neasily win with 45-19.\nThey continue in the same manner against\nBristol, which is followed by a victory in epee.\nOn the other hand, Bristol didn\u2019t managed to\nget their full team there, considering that it\nwas still before the start of term, and had only\nfoilists as representatives. To compensate,\nthese foilists proved themselves a bit too strong\nfor the Imperial team, collecting a victory after\na steady lead.\nTwo matches down, two to go and summing\nup the results, Imperial stands strong with two\noverall victories. Last opponent for the day is\nCambridge, and even though our foilists have\nto see themselves beaten once again after a\nhard fight, the sabreurs make it up by swiping\nthe piste and winning by 45-15. As the epeeists\ntake their turn, they find themselves facing a\nsituation similar to the foilists, with one differ-ence: they half way through the match know\nthat they\u2019ve already won overall, thanks to the\nsabreurs.\nOnly ULU was left for Sunday, giving the\nteam a sleep in as an early reward . Once on\nthe piste the sabreurs repeate their success\nfrom the day before. The epeeist follow their\nexample, and as they reached the last match\nthey had a chance of getting an even better result than their friends. The score being 40-10,\nMarcello gets a sudden blackout and for a sec-ond, the team wonders what is happening as he\nloses 10 points before pulling himself together\nand finishing it off. The foilists were running\nup against a much harder task, the ULU team\nconsisting of only fencers from UK top-5, and\nthough fencing well find themselves defeated.\nEven though the journey home included\ntroubles with the trains, the thought that all\nmatched had been won kept them in a good\nmood. With only a couple of weeks to the next\nround, the last weekend of January at Ethos, it\ncontributed to some extra confidence as well as\na good start of the term and the year.\nMen\u2019s Fencing\nDAY 1\nImperial 1st 122 - 97 Bristol 1st\nImperial 1st 112 - 105 Cambridge 1st\nDAY 2\nImperial 1st 126 - 93 Oxford 1st\nImperial 1st 126 - 81 London 1st\n\n"

For example it will\nbe frowned upon if one is interested\nin marrying an American (shock hor-ror) twice-divorced woman in a time of\nconservative, proper ideals. Caught up\nin this scandal, King David VIII (Guy\nPearce), decides to follow his heart and\nabdicate the throne, leaving the crown\nto fall on his brother\u2019s head, George\n(Colin Firth), or Bertie, as he\u2019s known\nto his family. But this is not going to be\na smooth transition either, for George\nhas difficulties of his own; he stammers and is incapable of public speak-ing. Yet another thing one cannot afford to do when one wishes to be King.\nAfter an embarrassing public incident,\nhe is seen by a myriad of speech therapists and what ensues is a hilarious My\nFair Lady-like routine where Bertie is\nrequired to put seven marbles in his\nmouth to speak \u2013 apparently helping\nhim to pronounce correctly. Also, he is\nadvised to smoke \u2013 because it \u201crelaxes\u201d\nthe lungs.\nBertie tries hard, but nothing seems\nto work \u2013 his wife Elizabeth (Helena\nBonham Carter) supports her husband\nno matter what in the most dignified,\nsweet manner but she is also of course\nworried for the days ahead. It is not un-As another year begins again and starts\nus off right at the beginning of Oscar\nseason, the Felix Film writers take a\nlook back at the best of cinema in 2010\n\u2013 in case you were in some kind of year-long coma \u2013 and discuss some of our\nmost anticipated films of 2011.\nThere are three clear frontrunners\nfor the top films in 2010 that spring to\nmind, and probably fall into most Best\nOf 2010 lists without question. As the\nfirst big budget movie to treat its audience like intelligent members of society,\nInception fully delivered on its incredible hype, storming the box office with\nits stylish, mind-boggling, high-concept\naction and sealing Christopher Nolan\u2019s\nreputation as one of the great directors\nof his generation.\nAnother film that somehow managed to meet \u2013 even exceed \u2013 expecta-tions, was Toy Story 3,\nwhich rounded off\npossibly the best\ntrilogy since The\nGodfather with a\nwonderful narrative\nand family fun film\nthat set both critics and movie-goers\nworldwide\ngoing\nwild.\nRounding off an excellent year, Aaron\nSorkin\u2019s impeccably scripted The Social Network has helped fuel the debate\nabout why 26 year old billionaires \u2013 in\nthis case, brilliantly portrayed by Jesse\nEisenberg \u2013 have to be rude, often malicious people. Its razor-sharp, ultra-witty\nwriting makes it a very likely candidate\nfor the Best Original Screenplay gong,\nthough this may yet be snatched away\nfrom Sorkin by this year\u2019s early films\nsuch as The King\u2019s Speech.\nThis year is full of exciting films, and\nwe\u2019re not just talking about the final installment in the Harry Potter franchise\nthat could easily prove to be the most\nprofitable film of the year. Among the\nmost publicised films, we have a lot\nto look forwards to with Cowboys vs\nAliens \u2013 watch the trailer now; Tintin\n\u2013 with the versatile Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock; and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy \u2013 how can you resist another\nColin Firth film this year? Undoubtedly, however, one of the most keenly\nanticipated films are Danny Boyle\u2019s 127\nHours, which is out now starring James\nFranco \u2013 a name we will be hearing a lot\nthis year; and another from The Wrestler\ndirector Darren Aronofsky, Black Swan,\nwhich takes a dark dive into the mysterious world of ballet starring Nathalie\nPortman and Mila Kunis (inset). With\nthe Oscars just weeks away, it\u2019s\ntime to catch the best of the\nfilm season whilst you can,\nand start placing your bets.\ntil hope arrives \u2013 in the form of an Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue\n(Geoffrey Rush) with unorthodox and\ncontroversial teaching methods \u2013 that\nthe film really hits its stride. What\nthen develops between Firth and Rush\nis one of the best on-screen bromance\npairs in recent years between the two\nunlikeliest people: a tongue-tied, nerv-ous, upper-class King, and a confident,\neccentric speech therapist. The film\nreaches its climax as Bertie is faced\nwith the ultimate challenge \u2013 Hitler invading Poland \u2013 and England looks to\nunite behind a strong and inspirational\nfigurehead. As the pressure starts to\nbuild, the role of the speech therapist\nbecomes more crucial, as Bertie begins\nto rely on Logue more.\nIt\u2019s a moving, albeit predictable, story\nof human triumph: the film\u2019s events\nhave been carefully orchestrated to act\nas a build-up to the speech that Bertie\nwill inevitably have to deliver. When it\ncounts, the film can easily convey the\nstirring impact it was supposed to bring\nin the grand finale. It finishes as a feelgood film but remains upbeat through-out, focusing on the fun and somewhat\nunnatural relationship between Firth and\nRush. The smart screenplay that turns\na historical sequence of events into an\nappealing mix of drama and outstanding\nhumour keeps things fresh and easy to\nfully enjoy and comprehend.\nAs an actor, Firth is given the entire\nfilm to show off and takes advantage of\nevery single moment. With such a verbally incompetent character to portray,\nFirth still manages to convey a range of\nemotions without words, commanding\nthe screen with his masterful portrayal.\nRush\u2019s character is not overlooked here\neither, depicting a failed actor who, using his self-assured methods and peculiar charm, helps people to speak. He is\ndelightfully odd and comically patronising but when it counts, a loyal friend.\nThe warmth the two actors share is\ntouching stuff, even without the help of\na big orchestral score.\nIn a similar vein to The Queen, which\nsaw Helen Mirren\u2019s performances winning rave reviews and virtually every\nsingle acting award in existence, The\nKing\u2019s Speech is a film that is more\nconcerned about the performances of\nits actors and its period mood. Glory\nand high praise has already started to\nbe heaped onto to Firth, tipped by some\nto be the film that\u2019ll win Firth his first\nOscar, but the film itself is not ground-breaking. It\u2019s a rousing, heart-warming\nperiod drama \u2013 one of the most skillfully executed one of its kind \u2013 but it\u2019s\ntruly the performances that steal the\nshow.\nHappy New Year?\nAfter last term\u2019s successful return of iCU\nCinema, the club are looking to extend\ntheir reaches \u2013 showing two films twice\na week on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\nThis all kicks off with Tron: Legacy and\nChronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the\nDawn Treader which starts at 6.30pm on\nTuesday 18th January, switching the order of the bill for the 6.30pm showing on\nThursday 20th.\nOnce again, the ticket prices are staying within the student budget (i.e. the\nprice of a pint in London) with members prices being \u00a34 for a single film\nand \u00a37 for the double bill. Membership\nis still staying at \u00a33 for the year including a free film, so it\u2019s definitely worth\nbuying online to save that extra pound\nevery week. In addition to this, iCU\nCinema is bringing out its new loyalty\ncard that rewards its regulars with every\nsixth film free \u2013 not a bad deal considering the line-up they\u2019re looking to put\non this year.\nKicking off with the visually stunning revisit to the 80\u2019s classic, Tron:\nLegacy is set to be followed up in the\nweeks to come by Harry Potter and the\nDeathly Hallows: Part One for all those\nwho missed it last month (scandalous!),\nOscar-tipped British film The King\u2019s\nSpeech, and Danny Boyle\u2019s 127 Hours.\nLast term\u2019s revival of the All-Nighter\nis expected to be repeated with an even\nmore impressive line-up, rumoured to\ninclude Black Swan, Blue Valentine and\nthe Coen\u2019s brothers\u2019 latest True Grit.\niCU Cinema is now available to be\nfollowed on Twitter (@icu_cinema) for\nfilm updates and recommendations of\nwhat Imperial students want to see on\nthe big screen.\nICU Cinema this term\nGuo Heng Chin\nAditya Narayanan\nJake Lea-Wilson\nJade Hoffman\nLadies, look at your King.

One of which includes the desire to \u2018travel more\u2019.\nWith a destination picked and dates decided but\nyet to arrive, you perch on your seat counting\nthe milli-seconds before you take off.\nExcept travel plans are more akin to a realistic portrayal of a puppy in 101 Dalmatians:\nconceived in a fit of festivity, abandoned before\nthe Christmas decorations come off, dust-clad\nand forgotten before maturity - and certainly\nnever been taken out for a walk.\nSceptical I may sound, there are actually\nways - trial-and-error-ed ones in fact - to make\nsure that you don\u2019t give up on your plans mid-way, to give you enough motivation to plan and\nexecute the travelling from start to finish. Give\nthem a try - the difference could be between\nspending a Sunday afternoon observing either\nbeach-dwelling hot chicks/guys or a Hollyoaks\nOmnibus.\nSteady dosage wins the trip\nThis is sadly how many exciting travel plans\nmeet their pitfall: all the glamour, exoticness\nof visiting a dream location are extinguished,\ntheir appeal sinking like an obese whale until,\neventually, it fades into obscurity.\nSo you\u2019ve come up with a destination.You\u2019ve\ngiven it a set of dates. What there\u2019s all to do is\nplanning, and enduring the period between the\ndormant stage and the designated time of trav-elling. Which is most likely the period when\nthese trips find themselves abandoned, ne-glected, forgotten and unmissed because, well,\nyou\u2019ve lost interest.\nWhat often happens is that you\u2019ve overdone\nthe hype during the planning stage. When you\ndo too much planning in one obesely overbearing effort to get absolutely everything\nscheduled, you exhaust all the excitement and\nmotivation essential to maintain the level of enthusiasm during the limbo state of anticipation.\nTry dissecting your holiday planning into different aspects - transport, accommodation, ac-tivities, entertainment - and approaching them\nin stages. That way you\u2019ll give yourself consistent dosages of eagerness, keeping you as determined when stepping out of home as when\nthe trip idea first occurred to you.\nUnleash your inner\nIndiana Jones\nA choice of location is never sufficient - the\ngreater purpose always lies with the action you\nYou have sworn on your grandma\u2019s life you\u2019ll travel more\nin 2011 \u2013 now keep that promise. Dylan Lowe offers tips\non staying faithful to your travel plans\nwish to partake, whether it\u2019s skiing, hurling\ntomatoes at each other, finding spirituality in\na coffee shop, or letting your genitals swagger\namidst your fellow naked-runners.\nPick a to-do that is potentially memorable;\nthrow in elements of adventure, adrenaline,\nunpredictability, rarity and there you have it,\na promise of participation too good - and too\nshameful - to turn your back on.\nNever hitchhiked before?

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCIETIES\nFELIX\n24\nDay the First:\nThe Day We Didn\u2019t Sleep\nOn a chilly Winter day (Friday the 17th of\nDecember to be precise), thirteen Fellwanderers gathered for the Lake District Winter Tour,\nblissfully unaware of the epic three days that\nawaited them. It didn\u2019t take long for things to\nstart going wrong. Our intrepid President, Sir\nJim Carr, blighted by a horrific cough, could\nnot leave his London residence, so we left the\nunion at 5pm with one less voice to sing along\nto the 5 CDs of Christmas music we had stock-piled.\nAs it was Christmas we stopped at a Tesco\nwhich was about the size of Norway and decided to buy, as well as Secret Santa gifts, a\nfully-fledged Christmas dinner for Sunday\nnight. Rumours of frozen pipes at the destination persuaded us to buy bottles and bottles of\nwater. Despite the attempts of our new first-in-command James Allan to reassure us that the\npipes wouldn\u2019t freeze, we collectively decided\nthat it was better to be prepared, than to die of\nthirst.\nBad luck struck us again as we trundled along\nthe M6; traffic began to form and the minibus\nbegan to lose speed. As we slowed concerns\nover our progress were raised. And raised with\njust cause, before very long we were \u2018driving\u2019\nat about walking pace. At 11.30pm the traffic\nstopped completely. It was snowing quite heavily and the cars, lorries and national express\nbuses stuck with us didn\u2019t seem to be too happy\nabout the halt. Needless to say we Fellwanderers stayed true to joy and happiness and listened to Radio 4\u2019s rendition of The Lord of the\nRings. Others talked, read, or in my case, rolled\nover and went to sleep.\nOn waking some indeterminate time later\n(Radio 4 told me that the Hobbits had reached\nMordor) I realised that some intrepid explorers\nhad left the minibus stronghold to hear rumours\nof when we would move again, how bad the\ncrash ahead was and, inAlex the Grey\u2019s case, to\nwalk up the M6 to attempt to see the beginning\nof the queue. Returning asAlex the White (cov-ered in snow), he hadn\u2019t seen the end. This, and\nthe fact someone highlighted the problem that\nnone of us had crampons, made me roll over\nWhat\u2019s On\nAshura Awareness Week (AAW)\nThe AhlulBayt Islamic Society will be focussing on\nthe contemporary problem of the elderly and oft-ne-glected population during Ashura Awareness Week.\nFrom the 17th of January to the 21st, they will run\na series of stalls, lectures, nursing home visits and\ndiscussion circles in order to develop practical ways\nto appreciate and benefit from the experiences, wisdom and insight of elderly people and interact with\nthem on a meaningful basis.\nThe week also seeks to highlight:\n\u201c\u2013 the plight of the elderly population\n\u2013 what we as students can do to learn from the\nwealth of experience, wisdom and information from\nour parents, grandparents and elders\n\u2013 the teachings of Islam and other faiths on awakening our responsibility towards our elders\u201d\nThe main event of the week is a lecture by Sayed\nNahdi Modarresi on Tuesday that includes poetry by\nBrother Nouri Sardar. 6pm in G34, SAF.\nThe most\nwonderful time\nof the year\nWhile the rest of the country\nwaited for flights at Heathrow, the\nOutdoor Club headed for the Lake\nDistrict. Thea Powell reports\nand go back to sleep on that very white and\nspooky M6. I woke to an even whiter M6 (Lord\nof the Rings had finally ended), and rumours\nof movement were circulating. It was 3.45am.\nWe had been stationary for 4 hours. Finally, at\n4.30am, on Saturday the 18th of December,\nwe started to move and there was much rejoic-ing. For the lorry in front of us, there was more\nconcern than rejoicing, as the driver had lost\nhis keys in the snow. Phil Power manoeuvred\nthe bus around the lorry and after 5 hours spent\nstaring at the back of it, burning the logo into\nour brains, we were happy to be rid of it.\nDay the Second (technically):\nThe Entrance To The Hut\nAll I know about the rest of the journey to the\nhut is that Phil was the first to fall from our\ncompany, and there was much rejoicing (be-cause he was staying with another group, not\nbecause we don\u2019t like him).\nUpon reaching the hut we dumped the shop-ping, our bags, and debated the choice that\nfaced us: to sleep or to walk. As it was 7 in the\nmorning, we had the compulsory porridge, and\nas the sweet oats reached our stomach we experienced a surge of energy and decided to go\nfor a refreshing morning walked. The route was\ndecided, walk-able straight from the hut, and\nthus we left for the fell called High Spy at 9.30\nam, sugar replacing sleep.\nAfter the initial ascent, we found \u2018The Mine\nof Darkness\u2019. The long, winding corridor with\nwater dripping on our heads led to a large\nopening; a dome of stone reaching high over\nour heads in the pitch black. A sudden irrational fear of goblins struck us and we retreated.\nSoon after, we discovered \u2018The Cave of Wonder\u2019. Full of huge icicles, the cave reached high\nabove us and ice engulfed every surface. The\nslippery floor, covered in Moomins (icicle sta-lagmites), and the ice-adorned walls were quietly beautiful. After slipping around and taking photos, we finished the ascent to a cloudy,\nwindy peak and stopped for lunch. It was bitterly cold, so lunch was brief and we made our\ndescent, slowed by slippery mud, rocks and\npuddles. But as we descended, the cloud lifted,\nunveiling rolling ridges and steep hills and a\ngorgeous lake scene below making up for the\nbruises that we suffered.\nOn returning to the hut, we relaxed with some\ntasty vegetable stew and a few ales. We were\nhit with more bad news however: the pipes had\nfrozen.\nDay the Third:\nGreat Gable\nSunday morning was marked by cat-like\nscreeching, or as Joe and Alex liked to call it,\nsinging. No wonder then, despite the freezing\ncold and lack of running water, we were up and\nready so quickly.\nWe took the minibus to the town of Buttermere and made the very wise decision of a field\nroute, via the icy ascent, to a lake. After skating\nand walking on the lake (the thrill of the thick\nice clouding any concerns), we needed to make\na route decision. The sun shone over Scarfell\nPike on the south slope of the mountain Great\nGable, to show us a route which could simply\nnot be ignored, and there was much rejoicing.\nThe warm, steep ascent lead us to a beautiful\nscene of crystal clear skies to the west, where\nwe could see the coast and the mountains\naround to the north. The lower layer of cloud\nsinking below us, with the sun glancing off it,\nmade us feel on top of the world. We ate and\ntook some obligatory photos, and began our\ndescent when damned bad luck had us again.\nApparently the chap on the left is too cool for bea\nHealthy Living Week\nHealthy Living Week is coming to Imperial from the\n24th-28th of January and will help all those students\nstruggling to keep their New Year\u2019s resolution to go\nrunning every morning or always take the stairs or\nto stop eating Big Macs for breakfast, lunch and din-ner.\nMonday \u2013 Energia personal trainers and Veg Society join forces to run a free nutrition seminar.

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX\n14\nBusiness Editors: Sina Ataherian\nAfonso Campos\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFinance Society hosts first\nof a kind trading game\nNews Summary\nBig bosses, big bonuses\nThe public backlash\nagainst large bonuses\nfor those in the financial\nsector is once again at a\nhigh. This comes amidst\nnews the total compensation for top bankers could\nexceed \u00a37billion this year.\nBob Diamond (pic-tured), the former president of investment bank\nBarclays Capital and newly appointed CEO of the\nBarclays Group is in line for a \u00a39million bonus. Mr\nDiamond succeeds John Varley, who, compared to\nhis peers, successfully steered Barclays away from\nmany pitfalls during the crisis. Diamond has recently\nstated that he has not made a decision whether or\nnot to accept the bonus.\nAdding fuel to the fire are Stephen Hester, CEO of\nthe Royal Bank of Scotland and Eric Daniels, CEO of\nthe Lloyd\u2019s Banking Group. They are due to receive\na compensation package that could total \u00a32.5million and \u00a34million respectively. The government still\nholds participations of 41% in Lloyd\u2019s and 81% in\nRBS.\nRecently the opposition has accused David Cameron of not doing enough to curb bonuses for finance\nprofessionals.\nGermans do it better\nWhile in much of Europe economic recovery is not\npicking up the previously expected steam, or has indeed come to a halt, Germany has bucked this trend\nby posting a provisional figure of a 3.6% year-on-year\ngrowth. This is the fastest growth since 1990 and a\nstark contrast to a decline of 4.9% in 2009.\nThe high figure is a product of a spectacular 14.2%\nincrease in exports and domestic demand, supported by a sharp increase in manufacturing investment\nof 22.6%. Households also helped buoy the figure by\nan increased spending of half a percent.\nOn the 29th of November, teams from several\nuniversities from all over the UK competed in\na never before seen trading simulation. The\ntrading game held at Imperial was part of the\nnational UK Investment Banking Series, a\ncompetition initiated in 2010 by the Imperial College Finance Society (ICFS) which has\nproven to be a great success.\nThe trading game itself is one of a kind \u2013 the\nconcept and technology are the brainchild of\ntwo Imperial students, Bradley Jones and Philip Heurich, both mathematicians in their final\nand second years respectively. Consequently,\nthey have founded the trading simulations\nand software company Dynamic Simulations,\nwhich aims to take the product they have created specifically for the game and bring it to\nmarket. \u201cHaving taken part in numerous trading simulations and comparing those with the\nexperience of working on a real trading floor\n\u2013 the contrasts between the two is unavoid-able. It was at this point we knew there was\na gap in the market\u201d, says Bradley Jones. The\ntwo main differences between the simulation\nthat featured in the UIBS competition and its\ncompetitors are significant. Firstly, the market\nbehind each security is dynamic. That is to say\nthat the prices of the traded instruments can be\ninfluenced by the players\u2019 actions. In this way,\nthe players really can \u2018move the market\u2019. This\nis based on an algorithm that takes into account\nthe underlying trend, the volume currently in\nthe market and the absolute size of the trade. A\nplayer placing a large order will undoubtedly\nmove the price of the traded security higher.\nThe game splits teams into hedge funds and\ninvestment banks and focuses more specifically\non the existing relationship between the two.\nHedge funds need investment banks to perform\noperations in the financial markets and investment banks earn commission by enabling these\npositions. This element of interaction between\nthe teams creates an environment which requires\nthe use of all forms of communication: shouting across a room, calling on the phone or chatting via the internet \u2013 the overall result being the\nbuzzing atmosphere of a hectic trading floor!\n\u201cThe focus lies very clearly on simulating what is called flow trading as opposed to\nprop trading. The former is what most graduates starting at a major investment bank will\nbe doing in their first years. But interestingly\nenough, the simulations currently out there focus mostly on prop trading\u201d said the other half\nof the Dynamic Simulations team, Philip Heurich. What is the real difference between the\ntwo types of trading? Simplified, prop trading\nmeans that you are given a lump sum of money\nand buy or sell assets with it; flow trading is\nwhen an entity, such as an Investment Bank, is\ncreating a market by joining buyers and sellers\nand enabling them to trade the quantities they\nare looking for. Naturally, it would be of interest to potential future traders in the investment\nbanking industry to get in contact with the particular challenges that flow trading poses. The\ngame hosted by the finance society serves this\nexact purposed and provides students up and\ndown the country the chance to get as close to\nthe real thing as possible.\nAfter 6 hours and 35 minutes of intense work\non trade deals and analyzing markets, the participants were happy to have experienced the\nexcitement of the floor and have learned what\nflow trading is all about. The overall winner\nof the UIBS challenge was a hedge fund team\nfrom UCL, winning a grand prize of \u00a31,000.\nOur very own Imperial investment bank team\nfollowed to take the runner-up spot and secure\na \u00a3500 prize. To win the challenge it takes more\nthan just the ability to read the markets: communication and networking skills are vital. The\nwinning teams displayed all the necessary skills\nmaking this type of event a great opportunity for\nthe recruiting firms to spot talent. The event as a\nwhole went incredibly smoothly and has helped\nImperial\u2019s Finance Society cement itself as an\ninnovative, experienced and market-leading\nplayer on a national scale. Smeet Shah, studying Accounting and Finance at the University of\nManchester said, \u201cMy dad is a stock broker and\nthis competition gave me a feel of his work life. I\nhave played similar trading competitions before\nbut this was the best of all.\u201d\nIt is great to see Imperial clubs and societies\nactively engaging in collaboration and competition with other leading UK universities. It is a\ncompetition that the Finance Society certainly\nhopes to see running again next year. Imperial,\nremember the age old adage of \u201cbuy low, sell\nhigh\u201d.\nYoung traders from across the country gather at Imperial\nEveryone quickly alt-tabs Facebook as the photographer approaches\nAfonso Campos\nPortugal \u2013 the next economy to\nbite the dust?\nThe small, maligned, peripheral nation of Portugal is\nnewsworthy again after managing to borrow \u20ac1.25\nbillion in a bond auction comprising four and ten\nyear notes. The average yield on the 10 year security\nwas 6.7%, a welcome decrease from the 7.3% high\nthe markets were previously pricing.\nWhile Portugal vehemently denies the need for a\nbailout, pickings are slim and the country does not\nhave much room for choice. Some analysts back\nPortugal noting the significant differences in the previously bailed out troubled nations of Greece and\nIreland.\nOther analysts, however, believe that Portugal\u2019s\nsituation is indeed dire and that if the country\u2019s borrowing costs do not decrease it may find itself in a\nposition where it will be difficult to keep up efforts to\nreduce its deficit.\nWhat? You\u2019re breaking up with me?\nFriday 14 january 2011\n\n"

For me, it\nresembles Ursula of Little Mermaid fame with her\ntentacles reaching caudally to who-knows-what. The\nofficial word is that Starbucks has amended their\nlogo in time for their 40th anniversary. The truth\n(I speculate) is that Starbucks have removed their\nwhite lettering so that it can no longer be defaced by\nprotesters to reveal a widely-used expletive.\nI\neat. Shocking stuff, you may be think-ing, but it gives me a certain problem.\nFortunately I have no life-threatening\ndifficulties \u2013 I am not allergic to nuts,\nwheat or milk. I am allergic to Gillian\nMcKeith, but that is another story. What you\nshould perhaps know is that I am tall. I also\ntake a not-extravagant amount of exercise.\nPoint is, I burn off a lot of calories. That, combined with my predilection for boredom, means\nthat eating the same meal three times in three\ndays was not something that was going to last\nlong. A former French flatmate \u2013 well, half\nFrench half American, not a good combination in this case \u2013 was derisive at the idea that\nthis was possible even once. However, I was\nhungry and wanted to avoid eating the one kilo\npackets of chicken or beef pasta which Sainsbury\u2019s amusingly label as \u2018serves 4\u2019.\nWhat was the solution? Learn to cook. Well,\nat least a bit. I had a degree to do, and although\nI wanted to fuel myself so that I could do it, so\nthat I could ride and walk around and so that\nI could maintain the adipose covering of my\notherwise-chiselled eight-pack, it could not be\ntoo time consuming. Cue a stream of Delia, Nigella, Elizabeth David, Nigel Slater. This is all\nsort-of fine and I am sure they have tested them\nall out and they all work and so on but despite\ndoing a PhD in chemistry, following recipes\nsomehow never massively appealed. I mean,\nwhat if I do not get the right result? What if I\ndo not like it? What if it is not enough or does\nnot keep? More importantly than any of those,\nhowever, what if the flavour is uninspiring?\nThis became a double-problem. I describe\nabove the insulation on my Adonis-like solar\nplexus. Well, there was a time when this insulation would have put the greenest flower\nchildren to shame on the scale of house insulation and so something had to be done. I\ntried typical dieting, but it was hopeless, I was\nthinking about food all the time and eating just\nas much as I otherwise would have. So, I cut\nout as much as I could of cream, ice cream,\nchocolate and so on. I replaced them with other things that were not so calorific and started\nto learn to like them. Not easy, but worth it.\nThe good thing about that approach was that\nI could still enjoy flavour. So, I did. I found\nrecipes that seemed all right, but were lacking\na certain something. I changed them. This has\nlead, perhaps inevitably, to now four original\nrecipes for different types of cake. The ideas\nare not necessarily original \u2013 one of them is\nchocolate \u2013 but it is my recipe. I extended this\nto other dishes, and now I have a recipe for Lasagne that I can give to Italians without finding\nunexpected dis-membered bedfellows the next\nmorning. Some of it is self-indulgent, apart\nfrom the cakes and the cocktail. I do not do a\n\u2018Smoothie\u2019 of any kind \u2013 sounds too much like\na description of the technique of someone who\ngives good fellatio. Instead what I have is fruit\nwhizz, which is far better for you and does not\ncost more than your tube fare to make.\nI have never been to catering school, nor am I\nlikely to, but if you find you want to up or down\nthe calories on your plate, my advice is have\nmore fun with your food. Bun fight?\nWhen food has no meaning and gets you down, call for Uncle Sam (Furse that is, not the pointing chap with the hat...)\nSamuel Furse rediscovers the pleasures of food\n\u2022 \u00bd a clove of garlic, chopped\n\u2022 sea salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\u2022 3 handfuls fresh basil, leaves picked and chopped\n\u2022 a handful of pine nuts, very lightly toasted\n\u2022 a good handful of freshly grated Parmesan cheese\n\u2022 extra virgin olive oil\n\u2022 a small squeeze of lemon juice\nPound the garlic with a little pinch of salt and the\nbasil leaves in a pestle and mortar, or pulse in a\nfood processor. Add a bit more garlic if you like, but\nI usually stick to \u00bd a clove. Add the pine nuts to the\nmixture and pound again. Turn out into a bowl and\nadd half the Parmesan. Stir gently and add olive oil\nuntil the sauce binds and becomes all oozy.\nSeason to taste, then add most of the remaining\ncheese. Pour in some more oil and taste again.\nKeep adding a bit more cheese or oil until you are\nhappy with the taste and consistency.

The other half of the money will\nbe used to further research and advance education\nat the new school. The school will also receive $250\nmillion from the Singapore Government.\nThe Lee Foundation was founded in 1952, principally to further medical education and help the financially disadvantaged. The NTU Board of Trustees\npraised Tan Sri Dato Lee, revealing:\n\u2018Tan Sri Dato Lee Kong Chian had a vision to use\nhis wealth not for personal betterment but to improve\nsociety as a whole. His selflessness and generosity\nwill be an inspiration to the students of this medical\nschool named after him\u2019.\nIndeed, the medical school is expected to both further Singapore\u2019s medical education and healthcare\nsystem, and create multidisciplinary research opportunities for both NTU and Imperial, for example\nin biomedical engineering, translational and clinical\nresearch, and health services research. Any breakthroughs subsequently made would \u2018not only directly\nbenefit Singaporeans but will also contribute to the\nwell-being of the wider regional and global community\u2019, a speculation made by the chairman of the\nschool\u2019s temporary Governing Board, Mr Lim Chuan\nPoh.\nThe school will initiate a new style of medical education in Singapore, combining a science-based approach with \u2018e-Learning\u2019, a style familiar to Imperial\u2019s\nown medical students. NTU\u2019s strength in engineering\nwill be used to utilise technological advances in the\nfield of medicine. The school, which will accept 50\nstudents in 2013, will undoubtedly help ensure the\nsuccessful future of healthcare in Singapore, as well\nas, according to the Lee Foundation, \u2018provide assistance to bright and needy medical students who can\npursue their life\u2019s mission\u2019.\nKatherine Bettany\nThe long-term future of student accommodation in the Evelyn Gardens area is currently under review, with the high cost of necessary refurbishment likely to mean the closure of halls\nsuch as Fisher. The uncertainty comes as Imperial is reviewing all areas of its accommodation\nprovision including the wardening system and\nan investigation by Facilities Management into\nstate of repair of all halls. The Director of Commercial Services, Jane Neary, stressed that the\nCollege is committed to providing accommodation for 1st year students and that the halls\nwould remain open for the foreseeable future,\nuntil they could be replaced.\nThe halls at Evelyn Gardens are considered\nto be in need of a radical refurbishment, since\nAugust 127 ceilings in Fisher and other halls\nhave required repair. Mrs. Neary said, \u201cThe\nproblem [with the halls at Evelyn Gardens] is\nthe condition of the buildings. These buildings\nhave had no financial investment for as long as\nanyone can remember. At some stage we have\nto make economic decisions about whether\n[they] are viable.\u201d\nProfessor Martin Head, the Warden at Fisher\nHall, said: \u201cThe hall is [\u2026] in need of proper\nrefurbishment. The other halls [at Evelyn Gardens] are all in comparatively much better condition.\u201d However, Jane Neary denied that Fisher Hall was sub-standard saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not that\n[the hall isn\u2019t] good enough, it\u2019s completely\nlegal, they\u2019re all completely legal. [\u2026] We\u2019ve\ndone all the urgent work.\u201d\nIn July, Imperial and the Wellcome Trust submitted a joint planning application for Fisher\nHall. The application sets out plans to convert\nthe hall, which has 156 beds, into 28 housing\nunits for elderly care and says \u201cthe need for\nstudent accommodation [at Evelyn Gardens]\nhas been reduced as new halls of residence\nhave been created [\u2026] at Princes Gardens\u201d. A\nsingle standard room at Fisher is currently either \u00a395 or \u00a3108 per week. The cheapest single\nroom at Eastside \u2013 one of the new halls referred\nto in the statement \u2013 is \u00a3168 per week, rising\nto \u00a3227 per week for a \u201cdeluxe\u201d single room.\nMrs. Neary dismissed concerns that this questioned the College\u2019s commitment to affordable\nhousing saying, \u201cPlanning application speak\nand what we do is completely different\u201d, also\nreassuring that \u201cwe\u2019re going to do what\u2019s right\nfor students.\u201d\nProfessor Head said that the College\u2019s actions\nwere understandable: \u201cObviously I would prefer\nfor Fisher to stay open as a hall, as the students\nUncertain future for\nEvelyn Gardens\nare a great bunch of people to look after, but I\nalso understand that the lease on the building\nis finite so eventually it will have to change its\nfunction.\u201d He added \u201cI personally am in favour\nof retaining \u2018budget\u2019 accommodation such as\nFisher, to maintain the range of choices currently available to prospective [Imperial] students.\u201d\nUnion President Alex Kendall questioned\nthe motives behind the planning application:\n\u201cI think that the College does take affordabil-ity seriously, but this decision does seem to be\ndriven by cost-cutting. Fisher Hall is in urgent\nneed of refurbishment and Imperial are less\nlikely to lose money if it is sold on rather than\nretained as student accommodation.\u201d\nHowever, John Anderson, the Chief Executive Officer of the College Fund, said that the\nexpiry of the leasehold on Fisher Hall meant\nthat Imperial had to consider its options. The\nleasehold expires in 38 years, after which it\nreverts back to the freeholders, the Wellcome\nTrust. He explained that Imperial needs to consider the value of the property as the expiry\ndate grows closer. \u201cThe College is going to be\nlooking at an 8-figure sum to refurbish Fisher\nHall to achieve the standard of other halls. To\nmy mind, it simply doesn\u2019t make sense to invest that much money into a property for which\nthe lease expires in 38 years.\u201d\nThe idea of converting Fisher Hall into property for elderly care use is, according to Mr\nAnderson, a much wiser choice as the property\nwould generate a considerable return. He added that this would mean that the College would\nfind itself in a much better position when the\nleasehold expires, both financially and in relation to the freeholder.\nThe College Fund and Commercial Services\nare currently searching for new sites for accommodation that would allow them to convert\nthe Evelyn Gardens halls. Mrs. Neary said that\nshe was looking at sites on the outer edge of\nzone two which would allow the Accommodation service to provide similar prices to those\ncurrently charged in halls at Evelyn Gardens.\nShe said that there would be a move away\nfrom shared accommodation but emphasised\nthat it was important to have student input on\nthe matter: \u201cGoing forward, I don\u2019t think students want twin or triple rooms. The reasons\nthey take them is because the [price] is right.\u201d\nShe argued that ultimately, the question to ask\nstudents is: \u201cWould you prefer to live on the\noutskirts of zone two and come in or would you\nlike to share a room on campus? \u201c\nMr Anderson said that the College would not\nbe seeking a solution through private halls of\nresidence and added that it would not be easy\nto find an alternative site, meaning that it is unlikely that any changes will happen in the near\nfuture: \u201cIn an ideal world, it would be great to\nfind a site similar to Princes Gardens, in terms\nof atmosphere and community, where we could\nprovide lower cost accommodation on a significant scale and move away from the current\nusage of the buildings such as those at Evelyn\nGardens [\u2026] Unfortunately they rarely come\nforward in West London.\u201d Unless they do, he\nsaid, it is unlikely that much will happen to\nchange the status quo.\nPlanning application proposes conversion of Fisher Hall to\ncare homes for the elderly\nNo changes until\nalternate halls are found\nKadhim Shubber\nVeronika McQuadeova\nIs there anything more beautiful than Fisher Hall at night? Yes...\nFriday 14 january 2011\n\n"

Now\nI\u2019m not a big Dave Grohl fan, but he does\nbare some resemblance to Jesus, and the\nonly other option was Carl Weathers,\nwho already has his own religion, \u2018Carl\nWeathersism\u2019.\nThe History of Grohlmas\nJust like Christmas, Grohlmas has an\nequally exciting and implausible nativity\nstory. It is important for everyone to\nremember why they\u2019re celebrating\nGrohlmas and understand where it came\nfrom.\nThe Nativity Story\nDave Grohl was born onto a drum kit. His\nMother, Davina Grohl, was the drummer\nfor the trance-funk hippy band, Spaced\nOut on Bass, and didn\u2019t even notice her\nwater break as she performed at a gig in\nOhio. In fact the vibrations from the bass\ndrum were so intense that she had fully\ndilated within ten minutes and baby Davey just plopped out onto the foot pedal.\nLegend has it that Davina Grohl passed\nout from blood loss and a cocktail\nof hallucinogen- ics, leaving\nher new-born to complete\nthe remaining set. The\nband\u2019s guitar- ist, Jed\nVon Glacier, cut the\numbilical cord with the blade from one\nof his iconic ice skates and then handed\nDave the drumsticks. Dave stole the\nshow and the rest is history.\nThe rest of the history\n\u201cHey Kurt Cobain\u2019\u2019, Nirvana, \u201c Bye Kurt\nCobain\u2019\u2019, Foo Fighters. DONE.\nGrohlmas Traditions\nBlaming everything on Courtney Love.\nSome people use festive holidays as a\nchance to appreciate all the good things\nin life. Grohlmas takes the opposite approach and encourages looking at all the\nbad things in life and then blaming them\non Courtney Love. This is where the popular phrase, \u2018Oh for fuck\u2019s sake Courtney\nLove, this is all your fault you repulsive\nslut!\u2019 originated from.\nBadass presents.\nThe word \u2018badass\u2019 makes you instantly\nthink of the Grohl. It\u2019s not surprising\nwhen you look at his track record of\ndrugs, prison and killing Tupac. To celebrate this people give and receive badass\npresents. These include rabid animals,\nangryAfrican children with machetes and\nthe album \u2018My Words\u2019 by Justin Bieber.\nThe Queen\u2019s rendition of \u2018All my life\u2019\nAnd of course, every year we settle down\nwith the TV to watch classic Grohlmas\nfilms (National Lampoon\u2019s Grohlmas\nvacation, A muppet\u2019s Grohlmas carol and\nThe Sound of Dave Grohl) followed by\nThe Queen\u2019s warbling covers of some\nFoo Fighters classics. She may be old,\nbut she sure knows how to play guitar.\nAnd if you think this is getting a bit too\nridiculous, go read the fucking nativity\nstory in the bible.\nDo you know\nhow humiliating\nit is for me, an\nOxford graduate\nsentence, to\nbe squeezed in\nhere?

    "content": "FOOD\nFELIX FRIDAY 14 JANUARY 2011 31\nChocolate, bananas and whipped cream. God I could eat waffles all day...\nH\nave you ever tried Sainbury\u2019s Belgian Waffles?\nThey glow a certain\nshade of yellow that reminds me of the Mercedes Benz SLK320 in sunshine yellow.\nGod knows just how many additives\nthey employed for you to \u2018Taste the Difference\u2019.\nThese had put me off waffles for life.\nUntil a standard post-night out stroll\nthrough South Kensington in the subze-ro climate, and suffering from late night\nmunchies. A dilemma, indeed. That\u2019s\nuntil the warm, sultry aroma teased me\nto look up. Like a heavenly being come\nto enlighten me, it smiled. It was the\nGod of waffles, Wafflemeister.\nWhy am I waffling? Because these\nwaffles are worth the waffle.\nWafflemeister\u2019s secret recipe traces its\nroots back to a family in Liege, Belgium\nin 1950 (see the family photos in store\nfor nostalgia). Today, it is still largely\nunchanged from the original, ensuring\nthat all ingredients used are natural,\nGM-free with no preservatives. And if\nyou think that there is some large factory up north churning out these waffles\non an assembly line, think again. The\ndough (not batter!) is freshly prepared in\nBelgium and frozen into balls before being imported directly to all three stores\nin London (apart from South Kensington, Wafflemeister is also found in Embankment and Portobello Road). Once\nin store, the dough (complete with sugar\npellets) is pressed out in the waffle iron\nso that the waffle you receive is warm\nand like no other before it. Toppings.\nThey can also come with toppings, so\nplease take your pick. Chocolate fudge,\nwhipped cream, marshmallows, maybe\nsome strawberries, blueberries or even\nsome banana? There\u2019s always the option\nto be lazy however and opt for the premade Wafflemeister favourites such as\nmy favourite: Go Bananas! Wafflemeister also serves freshly made gelato that\nhits all the satisfaction points. News in:\nsavoury waffles will also be made available from February, for those hungry\nstomachs in need of a brunch or munch.\nI could go on.\nI\u2019ll let you into a secret, though. The\ncreator of Wafflemeister, Alex Troullier,\nfirst thought up the idea whilst studying his MBA at our very own Imperial\nCollege Business School. Ever walked\nout of Bond Street station and wonder\nwhat that sweet, almost sickly, smell is?\nWaffles, at the Belgian Food Company.\nOriginally the owner in 1999, Alex\nwas able to sell BFC on before he even\ngraduated. He made a career in finance\nbefore deciding in 2009, to return to his\nwaffles. Wafflemeister officially opened\ntheir first branch in Embankment, and\nSouth Kensington and Portobello Road\nclosely followed in 2010.\nI spoke to Alex to tell us more\u2026\nHow did you come up with the idea of\na waffle business in 1999?\nI have always been very passionate about\ngourmet food and desserts. Back in 1999\nit was impossible to find a freshly made\nwaffle virtually anywhere in London. So\nI decided to set-up a business that would\nmake them fresh in-store daily and added other delicious toppings and gelato to\ngo with it.\nHad you any experience dealing with\nyour own business prior to this, considering it was a big step to take? And\nwhat was it like to balance the studies\nand BFC?\nLuckily I had some previous experience\nfrom running my own company prior to\njoining the MBA programme. That did\nhelp considerably in setting up BFC and\navoiding some of the pitfalls that come\nwith a start-up. It was difficult to balance both work and the MBA but you\nsomehow make it work by just adding\nmore hours to the day. I had a great work\ngroup and business partners. That did\nhelp tremendously.\nDo you have any tips for anyone wanting to start their own business?\nIt is not easy. Be prepared to work very,\nvery hard and only do it if you are extremely passionate about what it is you\nwant to do. Write an exhaustive business\nplan. Ask for help and free advice where\nand whenever possible. Try getting discounts all the time. Focus on execution\nand always listen to your customer.\nWhat was the reason behind you returning to the waffles?\nI love good food and after spending\nnearly 10 years in finance I wanted to\nget back to something that I was more\npassionate about.\nAfter opening three stores in London,\nwhat are your plans for Wafflemeister\nin 2011?\nWe want to focus on growing local trade\nKowtow to the master...\nWafflemeister is in the house!\nWith a motto like \u2018I waffle therefore I am\u2019, what\u2019s not to love? By Dana Li\nand our catering events business. We\nwill add 1 or 2 stores to our UK portfolio\nthis year and are also researching plans\nfor opening a store in the US.\nSo there you have it. Walk in. Grab a\nseat. Watch your waffle evolve from\na frozen ball of dough into a golden-brown wonder. This is no ordinary waf-fle, this is a Wafflemeister waffle.\nImperial College students are able to\nenjoy a 15% discount at the South Kensington branch for the whole of this term\n(until 25th March) and with the stores\nopen 10AM until midnight, and delivery to all SW7 addresses from 6-11PM,\ndessert just got even sweeter. Minimum\nspend for delivery is \u00a310.\nWafflemeister (South Kensington) is at\n26 Cromwell Place, London SW7 2LD\n(next to the bus-stop).\nOther stores: Embankment Stn, London WC2N 6NS and 137 Portobello\nRoad, London W11 2DY\nKatie Tang\n\n"

    "content": "felix\nTECHNOLOGY\nThe Motorola Xoom\nMotorola\u2019s Xoom has been winning accolades\nfrom far and wide after it\u2019s launch at CES. Boasting a feature set that puts Apple\u2019s iPad in the\nshade, the tablet is a sure sign that tablet manufacturers are no longer looking towards Cupertino\nfor inspiration.\nIn the processing department, the Xoom (pro-nounced \u2018Zoom\u2019) packs a hefty dual core processor\nfrom NVidia, while it also boasts a crisp 1280 x 800\nresolution on a screen that\u2019s slightly larger than the\niPad\u2019s. In terms of multimedia features as well, the\nXoom outdoes the iPad, coming in with two cam-eras: a front facing 2 MP camera for conferencing\nand a 5 MP for better quality photos.\nEven more interesting is the promise ofAndroid\u2019s\ntablet-oriented incarnation, Honeycomb, on the\ndevice. It\u2019s this combination of leading hardware\nand software that\u2019s leading people to call it the next\n\u2018iPad killer\u2019, a mighty title for a product yet to have\na price or launch date.\nTop tech to keep your eye on in 2011\nGlasses-free 3D TV\n3D was a big theme at last year\u2019s CES, as major\nplayers in the television market attempted to convince consumers that 3D should enter the home\nin 2010. One of the biggest stumbling blocks of\nany such attempt, however, was the fact that most\nforms of 3D hawked in Vegas last year depended on\nbulky, historically unpopular 3D glasses; a requirement that put off most consumers.\nThis year, manufacturers are going one step further and removing this age-old barrier to 3D. LG,\nSony and Toshiba were all out at CES with 3D displays sans glasses, but the conspicuous absence of\nany commercial release dates for these next generation products is a clear indicator that they are\nnowhere near production ready.\nWith 3DTV not making the sort of market inroads the big firms would have liked, glasses-free\n3D might be the tonic that the industry needs, but\nthe consumer has spoken - the burden of proof lies\nsquarely with the manufacturers.\nSlider Tablets\nNew form factors are rare in technology, but in the\nrapidly growing tablet market there\u2019s still huge potential for innovation.\nBoth Samsung and Asus brought out slider-tab-lets, ultra-thin screens backed with a QWERTY\nkeyboard. While build quality is probably going\nto be the biggest deciding factor in the success of\nthese devices, the form factor will probably prove\nvery popular with those people who have stayed\naway from tablets due to the difficulty of getting\nany real productive work done on them.\nWith other manufacturers perfecting the docking\ntablet form factor, it remains to be seen whether\ncustomers really want to be burdened with lugging a keyboard around at all times. Weighing in at\nnearly a kilo, for example, Samsung\u2019s device might\nbe competitive in the netbook class, but is significantly heavier than any competing pure tablet, a\nburden when you just want to watch a film on the\nway home from work.\nThe Motorola Atrix 4G\nMotorola continued in the vein of its recent revival,\nwith its Atrix 4G attracting high praise by those\nwho saw it at CES. On the face of it, the Atrix is\njust another high-end Android smartphone - running NVidia\u2019s Tegra 2 chip and sporting a crisp 960\nx 540 display that gives most other phones in the\ncategory a run for their money.\nBut what really stands out about the Atrix isn\u2019t\nthe phone itself, but the accessories that Motorola\nis promising to offer with it: a HD Media dock and\na laptop dock. The HD Media dock will allow you\nto plug your phone\u2019s display into a television or attach a USB mouse/keyboard to it and use it as a\nmedia hub.\nThe laptop dock is where the innovation takes\nplace - a laptop shell that you can slide your phone\ninto (much like a NES cartridge), that turns your\nphone into a full PC running Android, almost perfect if you\u2019re in the market for a phone but need the\nversatility of a netbook on the side.\n13\nFriday 14 January 2011\n\n"

Robert Gates is on a three day visit to Beijing set amidst\na backdrop of increasing US concerns towards China\u2019s rapidly modernising military. America is currently the only country with an operating stealth fighter,\nalthough China and Russia are known to be working\non prototypes. The Chinese stealth fighter is not expected to be operational until 2017-19. Meanwhile,\nthe Chinese Defence Minister stressed, in an interview on state television, that Chinese research and\ndevelopment of weapons posed no threat to any\ncountry.\nChina\nThe Organisation of American States have asked\nHaiti\u2019s ruling party candidate to withdraw from the\nrun-off round in the race for the bitterly-contested\npresidency, according to a draft obtained by AP.\nThis threatens to increase tensions in a Haiti devastated by an earthquake last year. The ruling party\u2019s\ncandidate Jude Celestin narrowly came ahead of pop\nsinger Michael Martelly in November\u2019s election. Rene\nPreval, Haiti\u2019s President, has said that he does not\nfavour any candidate; however, evidence showing\nJude Celestin has lost must be produced. Most Haitians are increasingly desperate for a solution to the\ngrowing humanitarian crisis and want a strong government to guide Haiti.\nIvory Coast\nAt least five people have been killed in clashes\nbetween supporters of presidential rivals in Ivory\nCoast. The Governor of Abidjan has been quoted as\nsaying that the dead included three policemen and\ntwo civilians. The violence in Abidjan comes after\na UN Security Council Resolution deploring the violence in Ivory Coast in the aftermath of November\u2019s\npresidential election. Incumbent President Gbagbo\nhas refused to cede power to Mr Ouattara despite\ninternational pressure. He has also ruled out the formation of a national unity Government with Mr Ouattara. Ivory Coast is divided between the North, which\nsupports Mr Ouattara, and the South, which supports\nGbagbo, and is becoming increasingly destabilised.\nNew Year\u2019s Resolutions\nRajat Jain & Joseph Letts consider what 2011 holds for\nworld leaders. And Nick Clegg...\nWell 2010 certainly has been an interesting year for the Italian Prime Minister. Barely surviving several votes of\nno confidence throughout the year and\nhaving his coalition partner Gianfranco Fini and four other coalition government members step down has done\na terrible number on the stability of his\ngovernment and it seems only a matter\nof time before things begin to collapse.\nAnd of his New Year\u2019s Resolutions?\nWell between trying his best not to be\ntried for corruption and tax fraud, trying to win back the love and confidence\nof his people, and staying in control\nof his country, business empire and\nhealth (he is 74), I\u2019d say he has quite\na busy year ahead. Of course he also\nmight try to spend the year coaxing his\nfemale ministers to wear tighter shorts\nas well. Life really is hard sometimes\nisn\u2019t it?\nThe Deputy Prime Minister and\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats has a\ntough balancing act to follow. With his\npopularity over the past twelve months\nrising and falling faster than a G6, the\nfuture of the Liberal Democrats as a\ncredible party hinges on the success of\nthe Alternative Vote referendum on the\n5th May. Some accuse Clegg sold his\nsoul to the Conservatives to gain this\nreferendum. To lose would not only reduce the possible Commons gains from\nbeing a popular second preference, but\neven possibly eliminate them as first\npreference in their traditional Liberal\nstrongholds. Yet, if Clegg\u2019s war against\nthe Conservative\u2019s over the referendum\nis too successful, it could destroy the\ncredibility of the coalition completely.\nNo doubt Clegg is hoping Vince Cable\nwill think before he speaks during the\nnext four months.\nWith his coalition government formally intact and old corruption charges relating to corporate kickbacks dropped\non the basis of diplomatic immunity, it\nlooked like this was going to be a good\nyear for the Pakistani president. As if\nZadari! The assassination of the Governor of Pakistan\u2019s Punjab Province,\nSalman Taseer, on the 4th of January,\nhas left Pakistan facing a dangerous\ntear in its social fabric. The traditionally Liberal and moderate Pakistan People\u2019s Party, of which both the President\nand late Governor belong, must decide\nwhether to revoke blasphemy laws and\nface growing social tensions, riots and\nincreased militancy. The alternative is\nto allow the continued persecution of\nChristians and anger Pakistan\u2019s hard-fought-for Western allies. Asif Ali\nZardari has another extremely tough\nyear ahead of him.\nAt the start of every year, the incumbent President of the United States\nholds a State of the Union speech. Here\nhe discusses the current position of the\ncountry and what he expects to achieve\nin the year ahead, with the next being\non Jan 25th. For 2011 President Obama\nhas a tough battle ahead after the\nchange in composition of the House of\nRepresentatives in the 2010 Midterm\nElections, leading to the Democrats\nlosing the controlling share of seats.\nThe President also has to deal with the\nfallout from the publication of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks, and the effect this might have on the resolution\nof American intervention in Afghanistan. Also, after the horrific shootings\nin Arizona last week, the President and\nGovernment might decide to stir the\nongoing passion-filled debate about\nchanges to national gun-control laws.\nFollowing the end of the 25-year civil\nwar with Tamil rebels and the electoral\ndefeat of Gen. Fonseka, who lead the\ncampaign to defeat the rebels, 2010\nwas good for the Sri Lankan president.\nBut he must spend 2011 integrating the\nTamils. He claims 5000 former rebels\nare held in prison camps. Signs are,\nhowever, promising; 100 have been\nfreed and have claimed they were\ntreated well and education of former\nrebels to help them find jobs and integrate into society has begun. The\nPresident has also begun talks with\nTamil National Alliance, the main\nTamil party. However, tensions still\nexist. With Human Rights groups not\ngiven access to much of the old rebel\nstronghold, Wikileaks accusations of\nmassacres and questions over electoral\nfraud, mending Sri Lankan society\nwill hardly be an easy task.\nWho? Eva Mendes? No, Evo Morales\nis the President of Bolivia and leader of\nthe Movement for Socialism party. He\nhas had a rather arduous 2010. Since\nfuel prices were frozen in Bolivia since\n2006, citizens have been protected\nfrom the pain of increasing oil prices\nfor the last 4 years. Unfortunately this\nhas had the effect of causing a fall in oil\nproduction, an increase in demand and\ntherefore an increase in oil importation.\nWith the cost of this hitting the Bolivian government with a $360m bill last\nyear and possibly a forecasted $660m\nthis year, President Morales tried to\nend the fuel subsidies and increase the\nprice of petrol by 73% last December.\nBut this led to bus operator strikes and\ntrade union protests which caused the\ngovernment to quickly rescind the mea-sure. However, as the new year breaks\ninto a run this leaves President Morales\nwith the difficult task of offsetting the\nhorrendous cost of subsidising fuel and\nstimulating the low production levels\nof oil without bankrupting either the\nnational coffers or his people. Bon\nchance, matey!\nEvo Morales\nMahinda Rajapaksa\nBarack Obama\nAsif Ali Zardari\nNick Clegg\nSilvio Berlusconi\nFriday 14 January 2011\n\n"

    "content": "18\nCOM M ENT\nfelix\nH\nappy New Year folks.\nContractual obligations\nmean I must make at least\none joke about not fulfilling resolutions in the first\nissue of the year, so here it is right now:\nI like my resolutions like I like my awkward man-hugs. Well-meaning initially\nand\u2026not drawn out?\nI\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m going with\nthat. This is why we don\u2019t do resolutions\npieces any more. That, and there\u2019s always someone making a computer monitor joke. Anyone making a joke about\n4:3 aspect ratios really needs to take a\nlong, hard look at where their lives went\nwrong.\nAnyway, that\u2019s my job description\nfulfilled until there\u2019s another big news\nstory about governments that I have to\nroll my eyes at. Let\u2019s talk books. I\u2019ve\nbeen reading \u2018Machine Of Death\u2019, a\ncharming tome about the future and our\ndeath. It\u2019s a collection of short stories all\nwrapped around the same premise - that\na machine exists that can tell you the\nmanner in which you are going to die.\nNot when. Not where. Not even specifically how - a diagnosis of OLD AGE\ncould be passing away peacefully at the\nage of eighty, or it could mean being\nbludgeoned to death by a pensioner in a\nbus stop queue.\nIt\u2019s a great premise. It\u2019s a great premise because of the many things people wish they knew in life - the lottery\nnumbers, the difference between the\ntwo flavours of coffee on offer in Starbucks - the manner in which they would\ndie must surely be on a lot of people\u2019s\nlists. It also turns out to be a good way\nto bring out interesting ideas in writers.\nEverything from medical dramas to high\nschool frustrations; from the absurdity\nof EXHAUSTION FROM SEX WITH\nA MINOR as a prediction to the unsettling forecast of DESPAIR as the cause\nof death.\nThe poor sod whose coffin I stood\nnext to earlier this week, reading a poem\nout, would\u2019ve had a pretty sorry pre-diction. AGGRESSIVE INFECTION\nFROM HEROIN OVERUSE or something similar.\nI suppose we desire to know how\nwe\u2019ll die because we think we might be\nable to avert it or prevent it. The story\u2019s\ncrux is that we cannot. Knowing our\nfate doesn\u2019t give us the power to change\nit, and the happiest stories in the book\nrevolve around people who accept that\nrather than panicking over what might\nbecome of them.\nI don\u2019t like funerals, but I\u2019ve had a\nsteady stream of them over the last few\nyears. Certainly, family ones became annual events, but there have been departmental ones, and a friend\u2019s too. The chap\nwho was laid to rest this week had been\nsitting at my father\u2019s funeral not so long\nago, reminiscing with me about life and\nhow unfair it was that someone should\ndie at that age. Irony is something that is\nrarely lost on the universe, I guess.\nMany of the stories in \u2018Machine of\nDeath\u2019 reference groups that either protest against the machine, or vehemently\nrefuse to use them or be tested in any\nway. They declare that \u201clife is for living\u201d\nand knowledge of their death would\nonly curse them mentally. I imagine\na lot of people have that feeling when\nreading the book; that they wouldn\u2019t use\nsuch a machine if it existed, no matter\nhow darkly interesting it might be.\nWhich kind of takes me back around\nto the opening, and how I said I didn\u2019t\nAngry New Year\nwant to talk resolutions. A lot of people\nseem to obsess over them at this time of\nyear, which is why we get that familiar\nhost of commentary on them. I imagine\nmost of the Felix readership didn\u2019t make\nthem but feel they should have done;\nthat perhaps another year has passed\nwithout any obvious self-improvement\nor dream-achieving.\nOur illustrious comment editor said\nthat she hoped we might have some positive messages for the start of the year.\nI\u2019m not big on them generally, so here\u2019s\nmy contribution, seeing as it\u2019s 2011 and\nall: self\u2013improvement can start whenev-er, and your dreams will still be achievable in ten years time. Kiss goodbye to\nresolutions for another few months, and\ngo and enjoy being alive. Laugh at people buying sandwiches in Pret. Order a\nround of tap water for everyone in the\nUnion bar. And for Christ\u2019s sake, stop\nworrying. Plenty of time to worry about\ndeath and old age another day.\nNext week - fuck you all, I hate you.\nWorrying about self improvement is a waste of time, so\nforget about it, go enjoy yourself, but read this first...\nAffordable. It is hardly a glamorous word. It\ndoes not make the heart race nor the mouth\nsalivate. It implies a sort of glum settlement;\nwhen your shallow pockets deny you your de-sires, go for \u2018affordable\u2019. It is not a word that\nsprings to one\u2019s mind when thinking about\nImperial College London. Nestled in the regal\nSouth Kensington environment, our universi-ty, with its history, buildings and international\nreputation, is the complete antithesis to the\nemotions evoked by the word \u2018affordable\u2019.\nThe new postgraduate halls in Clapham\nJunction are certainly not affordable. \u00a3235\nper week will be attractive to certain students\nbut the majority will rightly balk at spending\naround \u00a312,000 on rent in one year. For com-parison, an average PhD stipend is around\n\u00a315-16,000.\nThis is not to say that they are bad value for\nmoney, unnecessary or a bad investment for\nthe College Fund. Griffon Studios is clearly a\nhigh-quality product, there is a market for the\nhalls \u2013 even if it is an exclusive one \u2013 and\nFelix will support sensible efforts to make Imperial richer; as Imperial grows wealthier, so\nits students receive a better service.\nBut the fact that the College Fund and the\nAccommodation Service are expecting international postgraduates to make up the bulk\nof residents at Griffon Studios reveals a truth\nabout Imperial. Namely that overseas stu-dents, who make up a significant proportion\nof our student body, are more demanding of\nquality and convenience \u2013 and more able to\npay for it \u2013 as well as being much less willing\nto settle for \u2018affordable\u2019.\nWith a large number of international students who rightly demand some bang for\ntheir buck and a disproportionate number of\nprivately educated home students, are we at\nall surprised that Imperial opts for the sort of\nglitzy infrastructure that leaps from the page\nof a brochure?\nOf course not. However, Imperial should not\nturn its back on \u2018affordable\u2019 entirely. London\nis an extremely expensive city in which to attend university and student concern about\nrising debt is becoming more and more of an\nissue. Extra efforts must be made to ensure\nthat students from poor and middle-class\nbackgrounds, and those who do not receive\nfinancial support from their family, are not deterred by high-living costs or drowned in part-time work.\nWhich means that Imperial must start to\nget more comfortable with the word afford-able. It would be nice if we could all afford\nhigh-quality accommodation but the truth is\nthat many of us, including international and\nprivately educated students, quite enjoy having that little bit extra in our pockets.\nFELIX\nAngry Geek\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nImperial needs to learn\nthat\u2018affordable\u2019\nis not a dirty word\nYou\u2019re all going to die!

As\nplanned, Chris and Martin had got the\ncoach earlier while I was to go home and\nmeet the others at the Union for 18:00.\nUnfortunately I left it a bit late so didn\u2019t\nget to the Union till gone 19:00. The\nothers piled in while berating me for my\nlateness and, with some trepidation, we\nheaded for Cardiff. Our fear was not unjustified as this was forecast to be one\nof the coldest weekends of the year. As\nwe headed off, the radio reported widespread ice on the roads, that Cardiff\nairport was closed due to snow and that\nthere were 26 mile queues on the M4\ninto Cardiff.\nConsidering this, our journey went\nsurprising smoothly. Once we got out\nof the standard London evening traffic it was smooth driving all the way to\nWales with only a brief stop for food.\nNear Cardiff the roads were still clear,\nwith the forecast traffic not materialis-ing, and while we were slowed slightly\nby fog we made good time and arrived at\nabout 22:30. After a minor navigational\nerror took us into an industrial estate,\nwe found our way to host\u2019s house and\nrejoined the other members of the team.\nSaturday morning soon arrived and we\nheaded off to the sailing club. This was\nmore of a challenge than it may sound\nas we had to fit six sailors and all their\ngear into my rather small car. However\nwe managed and soon arrived at the\nclub to find people rigging boats in the\nsnow. Once this was done, we quickly\nheaded into the warmth to wait for the\nbriefing. However our wait was soon\ninterrupted by one of the Cardiff sailors\nasking if anyone had jump leads as one\nof their motorboats had a flat battery.\nSurprisingly I did, so lent them mine,\nhighly reassured by the high level of or-ganisation, or maybe not. Eventually the\nbriefing did occur and after some more\nfaffing the racing began by about 11:30,\nonly two hours late!\nTeam racing involves races between\ntwo teams of three boats. In each race\nyou score a number of points equal to\nyour position and the team with the lowest total score wins. This results in intense racing as you must use the rules to\nhelp your team. If you come 1st but your\nteam mates are 5th and 6th you still lose.\nOn Saturday the weather was quite\nwindy as demonstrated by our great and\nglorious commodore Chris who capsized before the beginning of the first\nrace. Not fun in sub-zero temperatures.\nOur first race started well with a good\nstart. One of the other teams was holding\nChris up, preventing him from heading\nto the 1st mark, so I went to cover him\nallowing Chris to escape. Unfortunately\nChris messed this up and did a rather\ndodgy move which, if I was on the other\nteam, would have protested. They did\nnot, but Chris promptly went and capsized again. Smooth. Fortunately Fiona\nand I were able to get a 1-2 to win the\nrace anyway. In our next race, we again\ngot a good start and while the opposition\nhad 1st we had 2-3-4 and were able to\nhold on to get our second win.\nAfter a short break we were back out\nand feeling pretty confident although\nwe knew we would need to do well to\nbeat Exeter, our next opposition, who\nwere one of the better teams at the\nevent. Unfortunately this was not to be\nas a poor start gave them 1-2 around\nthe first mark and we were not able to\nrecover. Next up was Reading, a team\nwe thought were of a similar standard\nto us. Again we did not get a great start\nbut coming up to the first mark Chris\nwas 2nd and I was 3rd.

Yes\nthat\u2019s twelve out of ten!\nRicky Ponting: 2/10\nWill go down in history as being the\nonly Aussie captain to lose the Ashes\nthree times in the modern era.

    "content": "FELIX 27\nARTS\nThe clothes\nyou\u2019re not\nsupposed\nto wear\nThe Royal Academy\nsprings an esoteric jumble\nto get you thinking, until\nthe end of January\nHigh fashion is not like anything you\nknow or have seen in normal society.\nWhat is its link to the fashion worn by\nthe ordinary clothes-wearing public? I\nhave no idea. Images of beautiful women\nmade bizarre by face paint and freakish\ngarments as they strut down the catwalk\n(which may or may not be underwater/\non fire/an enormous chessboard) are the\nmanifestation of this incredibly profitable industry. However, the Royal\nAcademy is not Vogue magazine, and\nthis show is not a haute-couture runway.\nWell thank goodness for that.\nThe exhibition is split, rather vaguely,\ninto four areas of fashion, describing\nthe use of clothes as: personal and cultural storytelling, building as protec-tion, belonging and confronting (which\ndeals with conflict) and performing. If\nthese four sections sound like a good\nidea at first, they soon seemed to me\nrather arbitrary and difficult to differen-tiate. This vagueness in the structure of\nthe whole exhibition might strike you as\nkooky eclecticism or, more cynically, as\nrevealing an underlying lack of direc-tion.\nEach piece is very much a stand-alone\ninstallation, and the incredible range\nwhich is showcased over the sparsely\nlaid-out galleries means that there are\nsome excellent nuggets mixed in with a\nsimilar number of boring and unsatisfying pieces. For me these many lowlights\nincluded a film by Yoko Ono, a \u2018wearable mosque\u2019, a collection of architectural wigs made using traditional African hair braiding and felt uniforms for\nevery occasion. The ideas sounded interesting and full of potential, but their realisation seemed to lack the excitement\nor originality of their themes.\nIf the list of unfulfilled potential alone\nhas whetted your appetite, you\u2019ll be\npleased to know that there are plenty of\nother ideas swirling around the galleries.\nThe justification of the exhibit after all is\nthat just as a great oil painting or sculpture are pieces of art used to communicate themes, ideas and world-views, so\nfashion too can also be used for this pur-pose. This means every wooden dress\nand lengthy film installation is about\nsomething more than its aesthetic ap-peal, and that message is usually spelled\nout alongside the piece. But while I applaud the effort to help people understand how fashion can be art, sometimes\nthe exhibition went too far. Sometimes\nthe given interpretation was far-fetched\nto the point of ridiculous. How the\nlacy red see-through mini-dress and\nfacemask is an exploration of female\nstrength \u2013 specifically in Joan of Arc \u2013 I\nwill leave to your own imagination.\nAt other times though, the message is\nobvious, or becomes palpably important\nas you contemplate something that is\ngenuinely awe-inspiring and exciting.\nThe most popular image of the show, fifteen gorgeously bright girl\u2019s dresses in\nDutch batik, is a perfect example of this.\nSo too is the beautiful widow\u2019s dress of\ngleaming pins. An explanation on the\nlabel can provide a vital clue as to the\nmotives of the piece, but the installation\ndoes the rest to inspire through sheer\naesthetic appeal.\nOther favourites of mine were the film\ninstallation of laundry workers in Mumbai and the life-size cashmere whale\nturned into jackets. In a way the eclecticism works in favour of the gallery because there are original ideas to appeal\nto just about anybody.\nThe pieces that do appeal are excellent\nexamples from artists who have understood that if an exhibition of fashion, or\nrather \u201canything which could possibly\nremind you of clothes\u201d, must be called\nart then it must fulfill the same remit and\nthat is to show, not tell.\nRox Middleton\nLittle Rich Girls, 2010, Yinka Shonibare MBE, Commissioned by the London College of Fashion and Royal Academy of Arts. photo: Andy Stagg\nAlexander McQueen, Autumn Winter 1998: Joan of Arc Susie MacMurray, Widow, 2009 (made of pins and leather)\nPhoto: Andy Stagg.

Throw some Bose speakers into the mix and, hey!, you\u2019ve got yourself\ne Against The Machine...\nExcessive drinking clampdown\nenforced at Reynolds bar\nImperial College Union (ICU) attempted to contain the fallout in an official statement, stating that they \u201cdo not\ncondone the excessive consumption on\nalcohol\u201d. Indeed, in the student agreements introduced this year, which all\nmedical students sign, students agree\nto \u201cunderstand that inappropriate use of\ndrugs or alcohol is totally unacceptable\nin the medical profession.\u201d However,\nDavid Smith, President of ICSMSU,\nconceded that some students do drink\nexcessively, saying, \u201cexcesses come\nfrom a minority of students, mainly\nmen\u2019s sports clubs\u201d. However he pointed out that the problem was not confined\nto the medical school: \u201cExcessive drinking is a feature of certain clubs across\n[all of] Imperial.\u201d He also sought to\nclarify that the orange buckets provided\nare purely precautionary.\nIn light of the negative press attention,\nICSMSU has been forced to create a\nstrategy to curb excessive drinking and\nis set to enforce tougher guidelines on\nthe student body. Alcohol will no longer be served to a student who \u201cseems\ntoo drunk or [is] unwilling to drink\nanymore\u201d. In the reviewed guidelines,\nstudents deemed too drunk will be removed from the premises and jugs of\nalcohol will no longer be served. Most\nimportantly, a \u2018bar steering\u2019 group has\nbeen set up to collect student input into\nthe future of the Reynolds. In addition,\nseveral campaigns will be run in conjunction with ICU, to remind students\nof the implication of excessive drinking\nwith regards to both their health and future careers.\nSmith has sought to reassure ICSMSU\nClubs and Societies following the first\nbar steering group, which he admitted\n\u201cwent a lot worse than expected\u201d, in a\nmessage to ICSMSU Club & Society\nChairs, Treasurers and Secretaries. He\nwent on to explain that the Charing Cross\nCampus Dean, Professor Peter Taylor\ndemanded that \u201ceach club has a sober\nsteward so that if the bouncers have to\nkick someone out, then you have someone who can take them home. They are\nalso responsible for any vomit in your\narea.\u201d Smith conceded that he realizes\nthat people will be disappointed, but he\nstates that \u201cthis is the best we could do\u201d.\nMany of the guidelines will be enforced at the discretion of the stewards\non site. However Smith confirmed that\nthey had been enforced successfully at\nthe first Sports Night of the new term\nlast Wednesday.\nMembers of the Christian Medic Fellowship (CMF) \u2013 the only group to be\nportrayed positively in the article \u2013 play\na significant role in the stewardship of\nthe site. The role of CMF at sports has\nbeen questioned, however \u2013 the ICMSU\nconfirmed that CMF\u2019s role was only\nto steward and not to clean up vomit,\nas the article suggested. In an official\nstatement circulated to the captains of\nvarious clubs and societies, students are\nreminded that it is \u201cthe responsibility of\nthe individual clubs [to clean up] rather\nthan leaving it to the stewards\u201d.\nIn addition to addressing the issue of\nexcessive drinking, the security of both\nthe student body and the Reynolds bar\nhas been thrown into question, with\nmany students questioning how reporters gained access to the bar. Up until\nnow, access to the Reynolds bar, situated\nbehind Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith has been fairly open, with ID\nrarely checked at the door or bar. In a\npublication produced by the ICSMSU\nabout bar policy, it was detailed that students must now produce their college ID\nand sign in to gain access to the build-ing, as well as presenting valid ID at the\nbar. It is rumoured that Campus Dean\nProfessor Taylor, suggested introducing\nCCTV cameras at Reynolds. He did not\ndeny the rumours.\nThe ICSMSU believes that the reporters \u201cobtained much of his information from student Facebook accounts\u201d.\nIn order to prevent similar embarrassments in the future, as well as maintaining the security of its students, students\nwill be reminded to be careful about\nwhat they broadcast in the public do-main.\nWith ICSMSU desperate to avoid\nsimilar negative press coverage in the\nfuture, it is clear that both the attitudes\nof a minority of ICSM students and the\nway the Reynolds is run will be subject\nto considerable change. If the measures\ndetailed by ICSMSU are unsuccessful\nhowever, the future of the Reynolds bar\nremains unclear.\n...Continued from Front Page\nWell at least they didn\u2019t throw any fire extinguishers at anybody...\nety released a report in October 2009 which\ncalled for universities to \u201creverse the decline in\nsubjects such as agronomy, plant physiology,\npathology and general botany, soil science, environmental microbiology, weed science and\nentomology.\u201d In December, the Plant and Microbial Sciences section announced that they\nhad \u201csequenced the genome of a major fungal\ndisease that affects barley\u201d. Professor Janet Allen, the BBSRC Director of Research said, \u201cIt\nis testament to the excellence of UK bioscience\nresearch that these scientists have managed\nto publish this world-class research despite\nthe difficulties of studying the organisms in\nquestion.\u201d In its final outcome document, the\nReview Panel that undertook the restructure\nconsultation recognized \u201cthe potential strategic\nimportance of plant science research activity\u201d\nbut felt that there wasn\u2019t a \u201csufficient critical\nmass of high impact research activity [\u2026] in\nthe plant sciences area upon which to base an\nindependent academic unit\u201d\nThe University and College Union (UCU)\nhave indicated that it will be challenging the\nlegal basis of the cuts. Students have called for\nProfessor Owens to resign. He is rumoured to be\ntaking a two-year sabbatical once the restructure\nis complete, but this has not yet been confirmed.\nThe National Student Survey, which started\nthis month, polls students for their views concerning their course. If the angry, impassioned\nprotests of last term are anything to go by, the\nLife Sciences Department can expect some\nfairly candid remarks from its students. As one\nof them recently commented on Facebook: \u201cI\ncan\u2019t believe there is only 1024 characters available to write about the \u2018negative aspects\u2019of your\ncourse/university, there is so much to say.\u201d\n\u201cThe Department\nhas defended its\ndecision arguing\nthat there is a\npressing need\nto address its\ndeficit\u201d\nCorrection\nIn the article entitled:\n\u201cStaff and students rail\nagainst job cuts\u201d (Issue\n1477 \u2013 10/12/10) it was\nincorrectly asserted that\n16 academics were being made redundant. It\nshould have said 14. Felix\napologises for this typo.\nEditor\nFriday 14 january 2011\n\n"
