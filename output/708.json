    "content": "f FEATURE Has fCC C got a TERMINAL ILLNESS? So the computing project should have been handed in by now\nshould it? Well, even if it you haven't done it you can't be\nbothered. The cobwebs lie in the terminal rooms, and dust\ngathers.. Now is the time for FELIX to go behind the scenes in\nIC's very own temple of technology, the Imperial College\nCompter Centre.\nIF YOU PASS the FELIX office to get to the\nUnion Snack Bar at lunch times you may\nhave noticed a change in number of people\ninside. Every day at 12.30pm thousands of\nChemical Engineers, Physicists, and\nElectrical Engineers have been handing in\nletters complaining about ICCC (the\nImperial College Computing Centre). They\nsay that if they had wanted to do a degree in\ncomputing then they would have done a degree in computing. They don't want to\nspend all day messing around in CEDIT\nwatching the internals of ICCC churning\nround in front of their eyes\u2014they want a decent editor, a decent screen, and therefore\na chance to get on with the job instead of\nspending all day looking through a NOS 2.1\nreference guide.\nMonolith\nSo where did this monolith that is ICCC\ncome from? The centre was born in 1964\nwhen the college got an IBM 7090 as a gift (in\na Christmas cracker?). In 1969 the centre got\nits first CDC manufactured processor, a CDC 6600 , and ICCC has been with CDC\never since. Currently the centre has a CDC\nCyber 174 bought in 1983, and a CDC Cyber\n170/855 bought in 1975. No-one would deny\nthat these are powerful machines. However,\nthis must be put into the context of the\ncentre providing a service to a very large\nproportion of IC, giving the backbone for\nteaching and research in a large number of\nmaths-based disciplines. The 170/855 for\ninstance, is short of memory.\nNot all computing at IC is done by ICCC\nby any means. There are vast numbers of\nmicrocomputers scattered throughout the\nCollege, and many departments run\nminicomputers of their own. (A minicomputer is much larger than a micro\nbut not nearly as large as 'mainframes' such\nas the computers at ICCC.) In particular the\nDepartment of Computing provides almost\neverything it needs itself. It is very interesting\nto compare the ease of use of ICCC (or not)\nwith, say, the S VAX which is used by\nundergrad ute s in DoC. Machines of the\nsame type as the the S VAX provide good\nvalue for money and are run by many\nacademic institutions across the country,\nand therefore there is a vast library of good\nprograms already written for them.\nUser-friendly?\nMost of the time that is spent at a computer terminal is spent in the editor. On\nthe S VAX you can see what you are editing\non the screen all the time. If you want to\ndelete a line you move the cursor to that line\nusing arrow keys, type 'D' to delete, and it's gone. On ICCC, you list a bit of program,\nthen mess around a while. Now you've got to\nlist a bit more, because you've forgotten\nwhere you are or what you've changed since\nyou last listed it. (Not that you can see the\nlast listing that you did\u2014it scrolled off the top\nof the screen three minutes ago.) This takes\nages because ICCC sends data to you very\nslowly. Why does it send data very slowly?\nBecause it thinks that you are a printer. And\nit thinks that you are giving it information on\npunched cards (which were invented in the\n19th century by the way). Made a mistake?\nDeleted the wrong bit of code? On ICCC\nthat's just tough isn't it. On the S VAX just\ntype 'U' to undo the last command, and that\npriceless routine can be resurrected.\nIf we want to use jargon we might say that\nICCC is not user-friendly. User-hostile may\nbe more precise. The system is superb for\npeople who need to invert matrices with\ntrillions of elements, but for ordinary mortals\nwho happen to be undergraduates in the\nChemistry Department it has about as much\ncharm as having a ferret shoved down your\njeans.\nVirtue\nSo when are things going to improve?\nICCC and their CDC machines certainly\nseem to have been left behind in some\n7CCC nerve centre-beam me up Scottyi\n10 Wednesday 19 June 1985 FEUX\n\n"

    "content": "The freedom of the press is not a freedom to\npublish any rubbish that comes your way.\nBut it sometimes carries with it a responsibility to publish the unpalatable\ntruth. A lot of people will criticize me for\npublishing a map of the tunnels this week,\nand say that it is irresponsible. I reject this\nentirely. The map should bring home to the\nCollege authorities how lousy campus\nsecurity is. This is not to criticize the security\nguards themselves. Most of them do a very\ngood job, and deserve our admiration. But\ntheir superiors get the guards to watch over\nlocked doors on ground-level. They cannot\nknow who enters and leaves by means of the\nCollege underground. Did it even occur to\nthe authorities that the ten microcomputers\nstolen this year from Aero/Chem Eng might\nhave been removed via the tunnels?\nNo. Up to now the College has\nconveniently ignored the existence of the\ntunnels . Now they can no longer do so. It will\nbe inter sting to see how they react.\nComputers\n'The College is not as good as it ought to be'.\nOne of its main failings is the Computer\nCentre facility (see pages 10 and 11). It is\nridiculous that Imperial College, one*of the\nworld's leading scientific institutions, should\nhave such poor central computing capability.\nThe Control Data machines are old-fashioned, user-hostile and have an operating\nsystem so non-standard, that co-operation\nwith other colleges throughout the world is\nhampered. The College must act quickly to\nput the situation right.\n- \u2022\u2022\nCatering\nMr Northey is interviewed on page 5. When\nspeaking to him informally, it is obvious that\nhe has a lot of good ideas for the refectory. He\nseems reluctant to see them in print\nthough\u2014you won't find any specific plans in\nthe interview. To be successful he is going to\nhave to sound out student opinions about\ntheir refectory requirements, and how they\ncorrespond to his plans. To this end he\ndeserves our co-operation.\nTeaching Standards\nWhat is the role of a University\u2014undergraduate teaching or research? The glib\nanswer is to say both, and further to say that\nthey are eminently compatible.\nBut there are those in the College,\nparticularly some Heads of Department, who\ndo not seem to care very much about\nundergraduate teaching. In fact, Prof Bruce\nMcA Sayers, Dean of City and Guilds, Head\nof Computing and sometime Head of Elect\nEng, has told his academic staff that they\nWILL NOT BE PROMOTED on the quality\nof their teaching. They will only get\npromotion on the quality of their research.\nThere is no career incentive to lecture well.\nSayers has had a great deal of success in\nattracting research contracts to his\ndepartment, and he is probably a good\nperson to have in charge from a research\npoint of view.\nThis doesn't necessarily make him a good\nHead of Department from the undergraduates' point of view, though. A good Head of Department should be just as\nconcerned about teaching as he is about\nresearch.\nStudents' complaints about teaching\nstandards throughout the College seem to fall\non deaf ears.\nNext Year\nNext year's sabbaticals are not going to have\nan easy time. Most of their problems will be\nfinancial. They must address the question of\nex-sub vent ion income. They must get the\nBookshop back on its feet, even if it means\nmaking unpopular or painful decisions. The\nBookshop cannot and must not be allowed to\ncontinue losing money. Make no\nmistake\u2014when a shop with a turnover of\n\u00a3350,000 a year makes a loss, there is\nsomething seriously wrong. And I don't believe that shop-lifting can account for it all.\nIf the shop continues like this, it will have to\nbe closed down.\nFELIX\nI hope that you have enjoyed FELIX this\nyear. I have certainly enjoyed producing it\neach week. I 've been criticised on the one\nhand for not making FELIX a copy of the\nlast three years', and on the other hand for\npreserving a formula that has been used for\nthe last three years. You can't win, can you?\nAfter four years at the Imperial College of\nScience and Technology, you must forgive\nme for being a little disillusioned, both with\nthe College and the Union.\nYear after year, both muddle along, more\nor less side-by-side. The same problems, the\nsame questions crop up again and again. And\nthe same old solutions are suggested\u2014it's only rarely that something gets done. Where\nare the dynamic go-ahead people with new\nideas and sparkling enthusiasm? They don't seem to be in the Sherfield building or the\nBeit building.\nNo. The College is rather like an aged aunt.\nShe gets rather older and rather fatter and\nconsiderably madder every year. But one's affection for her doesn't cease. One loves her\nfor her faults and t etchi ness as much as for\nher endearing qualities. And so it is with\nImperial College.\nTo those of you who, like me, are leaving\nCollege this week, and to those of you whose\nsentence is still to run, may I wish you all the\nvery best of luck in the future.\nAcknowledgements Many thanks are due to\nthe following for their help throughout the\nyear: Maz Fellows, Grenville Manuel, Hugh\nStiles, Dave Jones, Chris Martin, Jon Jones,\nJohn Burgess, Judith Hackney, Sarah Kirk,\nNigel Atkinson, Alan Barnett, Peter Hobbis,\nPete Coleman, Hugh Southey, Patrick Coll,\nPeter Rodgers, Rich Archer, Phillip Milne,\nRosemary Ivor-Jones, Tony Churchill, Ian\nBull, Eric Darbyshire, Dave Parry, Diane\nLove, Tony Spencer, Ajay Kapadia, Richard\nWeissenberg, Luke Boucher, J Martin\nTaylor, and to anyone else who I 've missed\nout.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed by the Union.

    "content": "prospect of offshore windmills, floating\nairports or concrete liquify natural gas\ncarriers. This trend is towards more and\nlarger concrete structures exposed to\ndeeper and more severe sea waters, also a good understanding of the behaviour of\nconcrete under these conditions is of the\nutmost importance. The direction of the\nresearch programme is towards improving\nthe understanding of the material and the\ndevelopment of future offshore\napplications.\nThe impact of an accidentally dropped\nobject can cause damage to a concrete oil\nproducing platform which is difficult and\ndangerous to locate and inspect. In\nrecorded incidents, objects weighing as\nmuch as nineteen tonnes have been\ndropped onto structures. Although\ndamage is often only superficial, it can\nsometimes be more serious. One of the\nprojects at Imperial is looking at how to\nguard against a specific accident. For\nexample, underwater oil storage tanks\nhave domed roofs which are particularly\nvulnerable to accidental impact, and their\nresistance to damage is being investigated.\nConcrete structures are fairly durable in\nthe North Sea, but the harsh environment\nundoubtedly has a damaging effect on\nthem. Another project at Imperial is\nstudying ways to quantify this effect and\nfind ways to improve the resistance to\ndegradation. The durability of concrete in\nthe sea depends on its low permeability,\nand it has recently been discovered that\non immersion in sea-water some concretes\nexhibit a significant reduction in\npermeability. The reason for this is that on\nimmersion the concrete grows a protective\n'surface-skin'. During tests, 25mm thick\nsamples of two of the most permeable\nmortars showed a reduction in\npermeability of 45% after only two weeks.\nAfter three months of sea water\nexposure the layer could be as thick as\n100 micro meters. Initial tests have shown\nthat the permeability reducing phenomena\nhave a considerable effect upon the\nabsorption capacity of concrete even after\ndrying out. which would be important in in\ntidal and splash zones. The next phase of\nthe research will be looking at the\ndevelopment of methods to deliberately\nenhance the permeability reducing\nphenomena, which could ultimately lead to\nimpermeable and hence far more durable\nconcrete.\nSmall Scale Model Testing\nOne of the fundamental problems\nencountered in model testing of offshore\nstructures in wave tanks, is that of\nextrapolating small-scale laboratory data to\nfull scale. A project based at Imperial\nCollege is hoping to overcome this\nproblem, and the results should provide\nuseful information to aid design of offshore\nstructures for the North Sea.\nBecause of a scale effect the flow\ninduced by waves past small diameter\ntubes, such as those used to construct\nsmall scale model offshore structures, is\nnot the same as that around a typical 2m diameter tubular member of a steel\nplatform. There exists a certain critical\nlevel beyond which the fluid loads behave\ndifferently. Full scale structures are in the\npost-critical range where as most small-scale measurements to date have been in\nthe sub-critical range. There is no reliable\nway to extrapolate small scale data to full\nscale, and tests on ex i siting structures in\nthe open sea cannot be systematic enough\nto provide any help. To try and over come\nthis problem large-scale experiment have\nbeen conducted at the giant Delta flume at\nthe Delft Hydraulics Laboratory in\nHolland. The flume measures 230m by 5m with a depth of 7m, and regular and\nirregular waves of heights up to 2m can be\ngenerated. The tests which have been\ncarried out on a0.5m diameter cylinder,\nrepresent some of the closest to full scale\nthat have been carried out in laboratory\nconditions. The results should be useful\nfor the design of new offshore structures\nand will also provide guidelines for future\nmodel testing.\nFatigue\nIn the North Sea the wave climate is more\nsevere than in almost any other area of\nthe world where offshore platforms have\nbeen installed. As a result of this fat i que cracks can develop in structure during its\noperation, and it is important that they do\nnot grow to a significant size. There is a major research programme studying\nfatigue in offshore structures based at\nUniversity College, and an underwater\nnon-destructive test cent e has been\nestablished there. The work involves\ncorrosion fat i que test on welded steel joint\nand threaded connectors, which are the\nareas where fatigue most frequently\noccurs. Alongside this area more\nfundamental studies on the behaviour of\nhigh strength steels exposed to the marine\nenvironment, one major advance resulting\nfrom this work has been the development\nof techniques that allow significant cracks\nin offshore structures to be detected and\nmeasured both in air and underwater.\nThe production of oil from small fields in\ndeep water poses considerable problems.\nAt University College there is a research\nprogram mme which is investigating the\nuse of a number of novel systems in this\nsituation. The tension leg platform, the\nguyed tower and various ship or barge\nbased floating production systems are\namongst the possibilities being considered.\nThe London \u00a3entre for Marine\nTechnology has made an important\ncontribution to the development of North\nSea Oil Industry, as well as in the recovery\nof other valuable offshore resources. For\nthe future, research in this areas will\ncontinue to be important as the\nrequirements for offshore structures\nchange to meet new conditions.\nEXEC PISS UP\nWednesday 19th June\nUNION BAR\n6pm until lam FREE ENTRY\nABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH CLIVE DEWEY\nFELIX Wednesday 19 June 1985 21\n\n"

    "content": "Tunnel\nVision\nTUNNELS HAVE BEEN a source of fascination for\nstudents at IC for years. A network of tunnels existed\nunderneath the old Imperial\nInsitute, which was situated on\nthe site of what is now the\nSherfield Building/Queens\nLawn. A map was printed in\nFELIX in 1957, along with a rather jaunty article which shows\nthat even then, students found\nthe lure of the caverns\nirresistible. Two years earlier,\nFELIX had reported that there\nwas an unexploded bomb in a blocked-off section of tunnel.\nThis was published less than ten\nyears after the end of the Second\nWorld War, and seems to be\nbased on eye-witness accounts.\nIf it was a hoax, then it was\ncertainly a very elaborate one.\nThe bomb was said to be of\nabout 2501bs, and to be located\nunder the steps leading to the\nRoyal Albert Hall, beside the east\nwing of the Beit building.\nOf course the massive\nrebuilding work during the\ncreation of the modern College\nbuildings meant that many of the\nold tunnels were in the way of the\ndeep foundations that are\nrequired for tall structures. At\none time the pedestrian subway\nfrom South Kensington station\nended near the Royal Albert Hall\ngarages. The excavations\nrequired for the Mechanical\nEngineering building meant that\nthe tunnel had to be made to\nterminate at the Post\nOffice/Science Museum exit.\nOne of the short lengths of\ntunnel under Prince Consort\nRoad was made up from the old\nsubway, and was later used as a rifle range. Access was from the\nRoyal School of Mines building\n(Goldsmiths extension).\nBut the new buildings required\ntunnels of their own. Power\nOne of the longer tunnels-underneath Southside\nA typical IC tunnel ler cables, telephone wires and\nsteam pipes are all best hidden\nunderground. Thus the present\nmaze of underground pas age ways evolved. The tunnels are\nthe arteries of the College. At all\nhours of the day and night, they\ntransmit the vital services and\ninformation that keep the\nCollege running. Many are\nmerely short, wide corridors\njoining together the basements\nof neighbouring buildings.\nOthers are true tunnels\u2014long,\nlow, maybe winding, and often\nunbearably hot, because of the\nsuper-heated pipes they carry.\nThe tunnels are permanently lit,\nday and night, and are generally\nconcrete lined. Possibly the\ndeepest point in the first level of\ntunnels is under Exhibition Road,\nwhere they go about 50 feet\nbelow the surface.\nMany of the nocturnal visitors\nwho have tramped these\nunderground passageways have\nleft their mark. Often just a name\nand a date, but sometimes\nsomething a little more ornate. In\nthe basement of the Aeronautics\nDepartment, at the entrance to\none of the tunnels, there are\nsome excellent portraits done in\ncoloured chalk on the wall.\nIt is a constant source of\nsurprise to many that the tunnels\nare very easy to enter. No\nattempt has been made by\nCollege Security to restrict\naccess. It is much easier to gain\nnigh times access to the tunnels\nthan to the Chemical Engineering Department, for\ninstance. This clearly makes a complete mockery of the whole\nCollege 'Security' system. They\nguard locked doors 24 hours a day\u2014and leave the tunnels\ngaping open for all to use. Even\nlocked doors aren't much\ndeter ent when they are\nunattended. The ASSA lock\nsystem was installed more than\ntwenty years ago\u2014and has been\nwell and truly breached. The\nnumber of R37 master keys\nsculling around is a standing\njoke. A professional security firm\nreckoned that in a institution the\nsize of IC, the lock system should\nbe changed every five years. And\nthe longer you leave a system\nafter five years, the more\nexpensive it is to replace.\nThe College have tried to\nrespond by installing elect ical key-cards in some doors, in\naddition to the ASSA locks.\nThese are so unreliable that\npeople go to great lengths to\nprop them open\u2014if they cannot\nget in then they smash the door\ndown. Great security, eh?\n18 Wednesday 19 June 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "LONDON\n1\nBeneath the\ncity streets\nOne of the most fascinating books to be\npublished this year is London under London\nby Richard Trench and Ellis Hillman. This\nexcellent book is a must for anyone who\npossesses a mind remotely agile enough to\nhave enquired as to what lies beneath his\nfeet. When something is too dirty or too\nsecret or too dangerous to co-exist with us,\non our level, it is consigned to the depths,\nand thus sometimes to obscurity. London\nunder London seeks to put this right with an\nintriguing catalogue of the rivers, sewers,\nrailways, pipes, cables, and secret buildings\nthat lie beneath the city streets. It manages\nit do so in an always interesting style, and\nwith occassional humour. At \u00a314.95 it is not\na cheap book\u2014but what glossy hardback\nwith colour plates is cheap today? An\ninvaluable work of reference, the book is\npacked with information. For instance, did\nyou know about\nSouth Kensington Knightsbridge Down St Piccadilly Circus\nBrompton Road Dover St\nThe Underground War\nAt the beginning of the Second\nWorld War, London Transport\nforbade the use of underground\nstations as air-raid shelters. By\nthe peak of the bombing,\nhowever, 79 stations were being\nused as shelters\u2014the public\npurchased the cheapest ticket\navailable, and went down below.\nOn the night of 27 September\n1940, 117,000 people were\nsleeping in the tubes. A whole\nsubterranean society developed\nand some stations had their own\nlending libraries, canteens and\neven newsletters.\nConditions were pretty awful\nfor the shelter ers \u2014often there\nwere no lavatories and lice soon\nspread from mattress to\nmattress. And yet people still\ncame to the comfort and security\nthat being beneath the ground\nafforded.\nOfficial disapproval for the\nshelters ended when Churchill\ncame to power. He established a War Room beneath the Treasury\nHyde Park\nCorner\nand a whole underground citadel\nin Horseferry Road. He also built\nthe Civil Defence headquarters\nwhich were under the Geological\nMuseum on Exhibition Road.\nThis was linked to South\nKensington Station via the\nfamiliar passenger subway. The\nstation itself was used\u2014London\nTransport's emergency\nengineering equipment was\nlocated in two disused deep-level\ntunnels. These were originally\nintended for a high-speed\nDistrict Line which has never\nbeen completed. A number of\ndisused stations along the\nPiccadilly line were also\nemployed (see plan).\nBrompton Road station (1909-1932) is near the Oratory\n(opposite the Midnight Shop)\nand can easily be identified from\nthe distinctive maroon tiles. It\nhoused the wartime anti-aircraft\ncontrol centre, and since the war\nhas been used by the Territorial\nArmy. Further up the line\ntowards Piccadilly Circus, were\nDown Street and Dover Street\nstations (Down Street is long\nclosed and Dover Street is now\nGreen Park). Down Street was\nused by the Railways Executive\nCommittee and Dover Street as\nthe London Transport Emergency HQ.\nThe Post Office\nAlthough the Underground\nsystem is known to all, few are\naware of the Post Office 'Tube'.\nStarted in 1913, the Post Office\nsystem of small, un-manned\nelectric trains extends from the\nMount Pleasant Post Office to\nthe mainline railway stations and\nto district sorting offices.\nConstruction was halted during\nthe First World War when the\ntunnels were used to house the\nElgin Marbles and other national\ntreasures. It was opened in 1927,\nthough, and within a year, one\nquarter of London's mail vans\nhad disappeared from the\nstreets. Each station platform is\nconnected by lifts to the sorting\noffice.\nExpansion took place in 1951\nlinking the Post Office with the\nGovernment's tunnels under\nWhitehall.\nAccess to the Post Office\ntunnels is easy\u2014 as well as the\nentrances in the Post Offices\nthemselves, there are a number\nof manhole access points. In\nDecember 1980 the New\nStatesman held its Christmas\nParty in one of the tunnels! Other\nGovernment Departments have\nalso burrowed underground. In\nthe build-up to the Second World\nWar the Government built an\nAdmiralty underground centre\nat Cricklewood, an Air Ministry\nHQ at Harrow and the Cabinet\nOffice was underground at Dollis\nHill. The Admiralty Centre was\nto be of use later during the\nFalklands War.\nLondon under London is\npublished by John Murray\npriced \u00a314.95, and is available\nfrom all good booksellers. Ellis\nHillman, co-author, is a governor of Imperial College.\nFELIX Wednesday 19 June 1985 15\n\n"

The UGC said\nthey were 'impressed by the\nstudent representatives they\nmet', but said they couldn't do\nanything for us. A new effort to\nsolve the Union's finance\nproblem was proposed at aUG M \u2014 the President would\nhave to check all the Daily Union\nbingo cards sent in to him. So far\nnobody has sent him any.\nThe College was evacuated at\nthe end of Febuary after a caller\ntold the switchboard there was a 'bomb in the building'. Most\npeople were evacuated from\nacademic buildings, but alarms\nin halls were largely ignored due\nto the many fake alarms.\nThe City and Guilds College\nCentenary was marked by a series of events in March. An exhibition, Tech 2000, was\nopened by the Prime Minister, a banquet in the Guildhall was\nattended by HRH The Duke of\nEdinburgh, and many distinguished academics addressed a 'Symposium on 21st Century\nTechnology'. Students were\ngiven three days off lectures and\nmany treated it as a holiday\nalthough enough were eventually\npersuaded to stay and act as\nguides for the thousands of\nschool pupils who visited the\nCollege.\nThe IC team reached the final of\nUniversity Challenge for the first\ntime, but were defeated by Jesus\nCollege, Oxford. However they\ndid defeat Somerville, Oxford;\nQueens, Belfast; Birmingham\nand Edinburgh on the way to the\nfinal.\nThe setting up of a National\nStudent Services Organisation\n(NSSO) by the NUS at a conference during the Easter\nvacation is likely to be a continuing story next year. The\nconference voted to exclude non-NUS colleges, and this includes\nIC, from the NSSO even though\nthey are members of the smaller\nconsortia that the NSSO is\nswallowing up. The com pet ance of the new organisation is also in\ndoubt.\nThe Union's financial crisis\ncame to a head early this term\nwith hard decisions having to be\ntaken. Initially UFC decided to\nabolish tour grants and cut travel\nsubsidies for IC clubs in an effort\nto reduce the \u00a328,000 shortfall of\nnext year. Five Year Plans were\nalso pruned heavily with the most\nnotable cut being the proposed\nnew boat for Boat Club,\nalthough Audio and Micro Clubs\nalso lost their allocations. Tours\nwere subsequently reinstated\nsubject to certain criteria.\nMr Mooney's retirement at the\nend of May was marked with a special farewell issue of FELIX. Whilst many will feel IC is poorer\nwith the loss of one of its great\ncharacters, few will miss the food\nwhich his sucess or will hopefully\nbe able to improve. The special\nissue featured the highlights of 32\nyears of FELIX coverage of Mr Mooney's successes (few) and\nfailures (many).\nThe end of the year was\nmarked with bad news about the\nfinancial position of students\nnext year. It was already known\nthat parental contributions\nwould rise steeply and the\ndelayed grant announcement\ngave the expected 3% rise in the\nmain rate. Students are likely to\nlose their entitlement to Housing\nBenefit and Supplementary\nBenefit in proposals to be put\nforward in a Green Paper due out\nsoon. A Green Paper already\npublished has announced the\nsqueeze on universities with a2% cut in real terms each year being\nproposed. Also there is to be a5% rise in Hall rents, decided at a stormy Student Residence\nCommittee meeting three weeks\nago. Caught in the middle and\nbeing squeezed from both sides\nstudents are likely to lose out\nbadly next year.\nIC's University Challenge Team - pipped at the post\nFEUX Wednesday 19 June 1985\n\n"

And there are few\nbetter ways of spending a summer.\nThe inter-rail card costs jur t over \u00a3100 for a month and\nentitles you to free railway travel\nin most of the countries of\nEurope and Scandanavia. The\nroute is entirely up to you. You\ncan go wherever you fancy, and\nwherever an appropriate train\nwill take you. You can sleep on\nthe train overnight and wake up\nin a new city every morning. If\nyou find somewhere you\nparticularly like you can stay\nthere for a few days, using it as a base to explore the surroundings\nby 'free train.\nEvery inter-rail er has their\nfavourite place which 'mus n't be\nmissed'. For me it is Budapest,\nthe capt i al of Hungary. To go to\nBudapest is to take a step\nbackwards in history\u2014it is a/ in-de-siecle Vienna, not preserved\nin mothballs, but full of a bustling\nand friendly populace. It is still\npossible to eat like a king in one\nof Buda's many fine restaurants,\nser an a ded by gipsy musicians,\nand it won't set you back more\nthan \u00a35 for a three-course meal\nwith wine and a taxi back to your\nhotel. Oh, and the youth hotels\nare about \u00a31.50/night for a shared room.

Make sure you have\nvisas for all the countries you\nmight visit. Make sure you find\nout rates of exchange as\nwell\u2014some one will try to rip you\noff. (Not just abroad, either. I saw\nsomeone hand over $90 at\nCharing Cross\u2014they got \u00a315\nback.)\nAnother decision to be made is\nwho to go with. My own view is\nthat it's best to go inter-railing\nalone. You meet far more\npeople, you go exactly where\nyou want, and there are no\narguments. In fact half the fun for\nthe lone inter-rail er is watching\ngroups of 'bosom-pals' having\nraging rows about what to do.\nInter-rail tickets are available\nprice \u00a3119 from the STA Office\nJCR (above Southside Shop, as\nfrom July 1). You will need your\npassport when you buy the\nticket, and every time you use it.\nIt entitles you to half-price travel\nin the UK and on Sealink.\nSUNDAY JULY 7th f BATTERSEA PARK\nSTA Handbook\nThe first starting-point for that\nworld tour you've promised\nyourself is almost certain to be\nthe STA office in the JCR. While\nyou're in there it would be foolish\nnot to pick up a copy of their new\nLet's Go handbook. It contains\n60-odd glossy, colour splashed\npages crammed full of facts and\nprices. Did you know that you\ncan fly from London to Karachi\nand back for as little as \u00a3336? It\ntakes a lot of saving I know, but\nwhat a story to tell the\ngrandchildren...\nThe handbook starts by\nlaunching into a country-by-country lowdown giving good\npoints, bad points and costs. The\ncountries are arranged in what\nmight be called 'order of\neasiness', starting with Greece\nand Spain (which are easy to get\nto and cheap) working up to\nSouth-East Asia and Australia\n(which aren't). After that there is a good\ngeneral section on visas,\nin no cul at ions, insurance and the\nlike. It also has a nifty little checklist of things you should take\nwhich could avoid embarrassing\nlittle incidents like arriving at the\nEast/West Berlin border and\nfinding that you've fo gotten your\npassport. Lastly all those\nabbreviations that travel agents\nlove to use are explained.\nThe author obviously has a sense of humour, and it is small\nenough to carry with you\u2014early\nfield-testing of one of the first\nissues also revealed that it can be\ndrooled over with total discretion\nduring lectures.\nAbout the only blemishes that\nwere apparent were a mildly\nsexist ad on page 2 from BCal,\nthe lack of captions for the\nphotographs (where is that\nsunset on page 24?), and the fact\nthat I'm not going to be able to\nvisit every one of the 457 places\nthat have caught my eye while\nreading it.\nAnd you don't even have to\nbuy it.\nLET'S GO\nSTA\n6 Wednesday 19 June 1985 FEUX\n\n"

    "content": "In the early seventies, when the North Sea\nOil Industry was first established, it was\nheavily dependant on American\ntechnology. This technology was not\nnecessarily suitable for use in the North\nSea, so to help the industry the Science\nand Engineering Research Council (SERC)\nset up a Marine Technology Directorate to\nco-ordinate research in the United\nKingdom. With the aid of funding from the\nDirectorate seven Marine Technology\nCentres have been established.\nThe London Centre for Marine\nTechnology was set up in 1976 and is\nessentially a joint project between Imperial\nCollege and University College London.\nThese two colleges play an equally\nimportant role in the Centre's activities,\nwith other colleges in the London are\nbecoming increasingly involved. The\nCentre has two important functions: to\nobtain a greater understanding of the\nfundamental aspects of concrete and steel\noffshore structures, and to provide further\neducation for undergraduates. To achieve\nthese aims, expertise from a number of\ndisciplines, including Civil Engineering,\nMechanical Engineering, Metallurgy,\nAeronautics, and Mineral Resources is\nrequired. The existence of a Centre for\nMarine Technology provides a way of coordinating these research activities\nthroughout the colleges. The Centre is\nkeen to attract funding from industry, and\nat present many of the research subjects\nare generated by consultation between\nacademic staff and industry. There is an\nIndustrial Steering Committee which\nprovides advice and management, but the\nCentre is maintaining its long term\nfundamental research as well as being\ninvolved in short term projects.\nThe marine technology research funded\nby the SERC in the United Kingdom is\ncurrently moving into a new era with the\nsetting up of twelve nationally co-ordinated\nresearch programmes. Each of these\n'managed programmes' will represent the\nwhole of the SERC funded research into\nthat particular subject. There will be\n'management agent' for each programme\nwho will be responsible for representing\nthe views of the academics to the steering\ncommittee.\nAll twelve of the programmes will follow\na similar organisational pattern. One\nexample is 'Concrete Offshore in the\nNineties' (COIN), which is headed by\nProfessor J Dougill from Imperial College.\nThis programme consists of twelve\nindividual projects, six of which are to be\nbased at Imperial College and six\nelsewhere. The SERC is providing 50% of\nthe funding, but the rest has had to be\nfound from other sources. For this\nparticular project there is a steering\ncommittee which includes representatives\nfrom industry and the Department of\nEnergy.\nThe Centre also runs seminars and\nshort courses which are aimed at people\nalready working who need education\nabout new technologies. These help to\ndisseminate the findings of the research as\nwell as increasing links with industry.\nThe discovery of natural gas and oil\nbeneath the bed of the North Sea and\nother areas on the Continental Shelf was\nimportant for the United Kingdom. To\nenable the valuable resources to be tapped\nquickly, economically and safely new\ntechnology was needed. Work carried out\nat the London Centre for Marine\nTechonology has played an important role\nir the developments so far, and will\ncontinue to do so in the future.\nAt present the London Centre is\nworking closely with industry to develop\nmethods of designing new types of\nplatforms needed to produce offshore oil\nand gas in deeper waters. The Centre is\nalso involved in a number of major\nprogrammes which are looking at topics\nincluding the fatigue and fracture of steel,\nbuckling of steel structures, concrete and\nconcrete structures, fluid loading due to\nwaves and currents, and others. Another\nimportant area of work which is based at\nImperial College is aimed at recovering\nother offshore minerals. For example,\nocean floor mining of deep sea sediment\nto obtain manganese nodules, or the\nmining of coal which can be found much\nnearer the surface than oil.\nThe Hutton Tension Leg Platform\nThe Hutton Tension Leg Platform,\nshown in the figures, was installed in July\n1984 by Conoco, and represents a major\nadvance in the design of oil production\nplatforms of the North Sea. It is the first of\na new gen ration of floating oil production\nplatforms, and many aspects of the new\ntechnologies used in its design and\nconstruction benefitted from research\ncarried out at the London Centre. The\nTension Leg Platform is essentially a floating structure stabilised and held in\nposition by groups of vertical tethers. This\ncompares with conventional offshore\nstructures which are typically of the\n'gravity type', resting on the seabed under\ntheir own weight. The major advantage of\nthis new system is that marginal oilfields in\ndeep water can be developed at relatively\nlow increase in cost with depth. The\nsystem can also be re-used several times\nwith only minor costs for disconnection\nand re installation. The aim is to develop\nthis conception further to exploit oilfields\nthat have already been diss covered in\ndeep water.\nOffshore Concrete\nConcrete is already widely used in\noffshore structures and this use is likely to\nbe further extended in the future. One of\nthe Centre's major research programmes\nwhich is based at Imperial College is\nlooking into the use of concrete offshore.\nExisting offshore concrete structures\ninclude underwater oil storage and\nconcrete gravity platforms in the North\nSeas, and in the future there is the\n20 Wednesday 19 June 1985 FEUX\n\n"

    "content": "the FELIX interview\nRob Northey became Catering Manager just over a month\nago, after several months of working with Victor Mooney.\nSince coming to College he has refused to be interviewed.\nLast week he made his first public comments on his plans\nfor the future.\nRob Northey, the new Catering\nManager, and Victor Mooney\nappear to have almost nothing in\ncommon. Northey gives the\nimpression of being young,\nambitious and full of ideas,\nattributes hardly applicable to\nthe Mooney of recent years. He\nalso seems determined to talk to\nstudents, to find out what they\nwant, and tell them what he\nthinks about refectories.\nBars\nBut first impressions of\nNorthey were not very good.\nStories circulated suggesting that\nhe wanted to put a television in\nthe Union Bar, and raise the price\nof a pint to a pound. Northey\nclaims he was misquoted.\n'When I first came here, I had\nto ask people questions to get\nreactions and I asked them if they\nhad tried different things. At the\nmoment the Union Bar has had\nquite a lot of money spent on it\nand there is a very successful\nformula. We have no real ideas\nabout changing anything in this\narea.'\nIn general, Northey is happy\nabout the performance of the\nbars, although he would like to\nsee better use of the Real Ale Bar\nand other areas that he believes\nto be under used.\nImprovements\nIn the refectories, on the other\nhand, he believes that he must\nmake significant improvements.\nHis priority is to 'modernise the\nrefectories and bring them up to\ndate, considering that the last\nmajor investment was twenty\nyears ago. Hopefully we can put\nthe refectories on a sound\nfinancial footing with modern\nfacilities.'.\nAt the start of the year College\napproached a firm of consultants\nto redesign the Sherfield\nRefectory. The firm responded\nby producing a plan that\ninvolved equipping the J CR as a refectory, and converting the\npresent Main Dining Hall to a JCR. College was intially keen to\ncarry out the plan, and even\nconsidered starting the work this\nsummer. This idea now seems to\nhave been shelved. Northey\nbelieves that the plans were 'not\ntotally satisfactory'. The consultants, in his view, 'put such\na degree of luxury into the area,\nmaking it so inflexible thai it\nwouldn't fulfil the requirements\nof the College, and the furniture\nwouldn't last for the time we are\nlooking for'. The College needs\nfurniture that 'will look good in\nfive years time'.\n'The Refectory needs to be a modern, adaptable area that can\nkeep up with the times and\ntherefore with modular aspects.\nTherefore, in the future, if we\nfind that a particular aspect of\nthe catering trade changes, we\ncan keep up with the trends,\nwhich we can't with the present\nrigid system.'\nSouthside\nNorthey sees Southside\nRefectory as one of the most\nurgent problems, there needs to\nbe a facelift there in the\nimmediate future.\nHis hobby is Chinese and\nIndian cooking and he intends to\nexperiment with some exotic\nmeals. One possibility being\nconsidered is having specialist\nfood evenings. He does realise\nthe problems, however.\n'The present system is very\nhampered by the present serving\narrangements which restrict the\nversatility of the types of food\nthat can be served. This will be\ntaken into consideration when\nwe are designing the new\nrefectory areas. We would like\nfeedback from the students about\nwhat we should be producing. A lot of attention will be given to\nthe ethnic minority groups,\nalthough it will be impossible to\ncater for all of them. Unfortunately we would need\ntwenty refectories.'\nStaff\nUnlike his predecessor,\nNorthey is determined to try to\ncreate a good impression. He is\nvery adept at answering awkward\nquestions. He avoids the issue\nextremely well, when he wants to.\nOn the subject of staff, he is quick\nto praise those in the kitchens.\n'The kitchen brigade is one of\nthe finest you will find anywhere,\nfor the actual work that they have\nto cope with, and with the\nequipment they actually have. I am full of admiration for them.\nConsidering the basic conditions,\nmany of them do a very good\njob.'\nHe isn't prepared to comment\non the performance of his other\nstaff, however. When pressed, for\nexample, about his middle\nmanagement, the group of his\nstaff which has received the\nfiercest criticism in recent years,\nhe will only comment that he has\nprepared a document detailing\nthe changes that need to be made\nto the management structure.\nNorthey does not intend to try\nto mislead students. He is\nprepared to speak his mind on\ncertain issues, even if it is likely to\nmake him unpopular with\nstudents. He believes that the\nquality and price of the food is\nreasonable, given the constraints\nplaced on the refectories. He\ndoesn't believe that there will be\nany major price cuts. He doesn't believe that Southside Shop can\ncompete with Sainsbury's prices\nand must always be regarded as a corner shop.\nHe seems determined to make\nthe changes that he recognises are\nneeded. He doesn't believe,\nthough, that the changes will take\nplace overnight.\n'I can't cope'\n'We have a lot of schemes, but\nmost of them take some time to\nimplement. If we can start a scheme, plan and implement it in\nyear or year-and-a half s time,\nwe are doing fairly well. With the\nsort of money we're spending if\nwould be very, very si Hy to rush\ninto any new scheme without\ndoing proper research and\nsimilar work. Otherwise the end\nresult might not be quite what we\nwould want or desire or the\nstudents would want or desire.'\nIn what can only be interpreted\nas a warning to College\nadministrators he adds,\n'If there isn'ta significant\nchange in a year and a half I will\nleave. I will have failed because I can't cope with the job or because\nI haven't received the support\nthat I need.'\nMr Northey is an ambitious\nman who sees the job as another\nstep in his career. Ke certainly\ndoesn't intend to remain in the\njob for over thirty years as Mr Mooney did.\n'One always looks for a challenge. I'm afraid I'm not a Mr Mooney, the incumbent for\n31 years. Any job that's worth\ndoing is worth spending five or\nsix years on. Obviously it\ndepends on the job market, what\ncomes along, and how well\nFELIX and other people look\nafter me.\nFELIX Wednesday 19 June 1985 5\n\n"

    "content": "Writing a sports review has been\na trifle difficult, having had only a complete set of this year's issues\nof FELIX as a source of\ninformation. From these one\ngets a rather distorted\nimpression of sport at IC.\nAlthough several clubs took part\nin the pre sti go usU AU competitions this year, many of\nthem chose to document this\nonly very sporadically. Some of\nthe larger clubs submitted no\nmore than two or three match\nreports in total, which is really\nrather poor.\nSides from only three\nclubs\u2014rugby, bad ming ton, and\ncricket \u2014 got through the\nopening rounds of their UAU\ncompetitions. IC rugby 1st XV secured their position at the top\nof their group with a resounding\nwin over Kent, having already\ndefeated Surrey and Sussex, but\nfailed to get any further.\nRegrettably, one of the few well\npublicised matches was the\nannual fixture between the RSM\nand Camborne School of Mines,\nwhen the visitors did little to\nimprove their reputation for bad\nbehaviour.\nMembers of the bad ming ton club did well in the mens'\ndoubles, ladies' doubles, and\nmixed doubles in the individual\nUAU competitions, with all three\npairs reaching the qu ater final\nstage. IC also reached the\nregional finals in the ladies team\nevent, only to be defeated by\nBrunei and Bradford. The club\nwas also one of the few to\npublicise its achievements\nadequately.\nThe 1st eleven cricket team\nfought their way into the second\nround of the UAU earlier this\nterm with a win over the powerful\nReading. Unfortunately they\nwere then defeated by Brunei in\nthe next match. The 2nd eleven\ndid rather poorly in the\ncompetition, but after losing the\nfirst two matches by a wide\nmargin they managed to achieve\na measure of respectability when\nlosing by only six runs to a Reading side captained by a man\nwith a grudge against humanity.\nApparently he has piles, the\ncricket club has also frequently\nfielded a 'Sunday' eleven,\ncaptained by Robin Graham.\nThis has provided an opportunity for many more people to play\ncricket. This year has also seen\nthe formation of a ladies' eleven.\nThe football club, it seems,\nhardly played a game all year.\nMention must be made of the\nHockey club doing something stunning\nSpot the ball\nfifth's, however, who had to\ncarry on playing through a series\nof depressing results.One game\nwhich must be recorded was the\nannual FELIX versus ENTS\nfixture. Despite the a bsc en ce of\nRowe of the Rovers, the FELIX\nside achieved their first ever\nvictory by the stunning score of\n7-1.\nOver the past year no club has\ncontributed more to the FELIX\nsports page than the hockey\nclub. Hardly a week has gone by\nwithout a report of the\nadventures of the mens', ladies',\nand mixed teams. Unfortunately,\nthere do not appear ro be any\nparticularly stunning results to\nwhich to draw further attention.\nThis also seems to be true of the\nsnooker club.\nFor the water polo club, 1984-85 was a fairly successful year; as\nusual they won the ULU cup.\nThey also took part in the UAU\ncompetition and only just failed\nto qualify for the finals in the playoff at Warwick. IC swimming\nclub continued to be fairly strong\nand again won the UL U championship.\nTwo members of the boat club\ndistinguished themselves this\nyear by being selected for the\nnational lightweight squad, and\nthe club itself had several good\nresults. Notably, the mens'\nnovices squad went through the\nhead season unbeaten, and the\nmen's top squad achieved a number of wins at Henley.\nThough the cross-country\nclub had a fairly ordinary season\nin terms of results, IC again\nhosted the annual Hyde Park\nrelay. This was the 37th gunning\nof the race, and it was won by\nLoughborough university for the\nfourth time in five years.\n1984-85 was not a great\nsporting year for IC, though\nmost clubs are still very well\nsupported in terms of student\nmembership. Hopefully this will\ncontinue next year and we will\nachieve greater success in more\ncompetitions.\nA man with piles\n30 Wednesday 19 June 1985 FEUX\n\n"

    "content": "Internal Services\nCommittee\nAlan Rose\n1. The Past\nThe ISC (Unionspeak - see above) is a relatively new committee; it has had two\nchairmen in the past. One of them is called\n'Hugh Southey' and the other one is called\n' J MT( Unionspeak - see below).\nThe former chairman loves to be praised\nby sabbaticals, he is going to become a sabbatical of sorts himself, he appears to see\nMr Mooney as the person i fiction of absolute\nevil, he likes to talk about refectories.\nThe latter chairman (sometimes called\n'Martin Taylor') simply likes to talk - a lot.\nHe has proclaimed ISC a committee without\ntangible responsibility, ICU's( Unionspeak -Imperial College Union) ultimate talking\nshop. Fine words from ICU's ultimate\ntalking head. His main contribution this year\nseems to have been provided a service himself\n(albeit serving only a small number of\nstudents) ie. court jester to the sabbaticals. It\nwas heartwarming to see the sparkle restored\nto the President's eyes and a smile lighting up\nhis little face, at what must have been, after\nall, difficult times for him, as the ISC\nchairman revealed delightfully scatterbrained schemes like pumping raw sewage\nthrough Mr Northey's kitchens.\n2.The Purpose\nThe area of concern of the committee is, by\ndefinition, services provided for students at\nthis college. Thus, the committee must\naddress itself to the is su qs indigenous to all\nsuch services whether they are run by the\ncollege or run by the union. With regards to\ncollege-run services, the role of chairman\nmust be to co-ordinate opinion, to be in\ntouch with student representatives on\nrelevant college committees and to ensure\nthat the problem areas are identified and the\nstudents case is represented. The responsibility for student-run services is\nmore direct insofar as the committee must be\nconcerned with improvements to services.\nExisting services need constant examination:\nAre they performing satisfactorily?\nCan they be improved?\nWhere the possibility of providing a new\nservice exists, questions like:\nIs there sufficient demand for it?\nCOULD IT LOSE THE UNION MONEY?3. The future\nThe most significant issue of the\nforthcoming year is likely to be ICU's future\nin National Student Purchasing Consortia.\nMy predecessor believes that the NSSO\n(Unionspeak - (National Student Services\nOrganisation) will alter its membership rules\nin such a way that IC may participate. This is\nindeed a possibility given that their present\nrules exclude such notables as UL U( Unionspeak - University of London Union),\nwhether any changes made would be broad\nenough to include all student unions not\naffiliated to NUS( Unionspeak - National\nUnion of Students) is another matter. In any\ncase I feel that some form of London-based\npurchasing consortium is a concept worthy\nof consideration throughout London Colleges whether or not it is viewed only as a contingency plan. I trust that the incoming\nsabbaticals will take the opportunity this\nsummer to talk turkey with other colleges\nunion officers after certain delegates kindly\nblocked all debate on the subject at the last\nGU C( Unionspeak - Gathering of Unrealistic\nCretins).\nMeanwhile, several ideas for new services\nhave been proposed, these include a photo booth, a photocopier, a second cash\ndispenser, contraceptive dispensers for the\nbars and a 'coffee-room' style alternative for\nstudents who do not wish to drink in the bars.\nSome of these proposals have been bobbing\nalong on the crest of a wave of hot air for\nquite some time and must be either adopted\nor killed as soon as possible.\nThe concept of student-run bar has been\nraised again recently. It is certainly an\nattractive idea, especially after noting figures\nfor student run bars at other colleges. For\nexample, at QM C( Unionspeak - Queen\nMary College) their bar makes a substantial\nprofit for the union whilst having a turnover\napproximately equal to one third of the bar\nturnover here and with beer prices starting at\naround 50p per pint. However, unlike the\ncollege-run refectory, which the union snack\nbar replaced which was an unwanted cash\ndrain, the bars at this college send bulging\nsacks of z lot ys Sherfield-ward and any\nrefectory manager would be reluctant, to say\nthe least, to lose this monopoly.\n4.And Finally\nI feel I must apologise to Martin Taylor if\nhe perceives any part of the above to be a personal attack on him. What I have written\nis based purely on what I have observed this\nyear. He has had, as he says, other\ncommitments this year and I am reliably\ninformed that he has made a good job of\nbeing Felix Business Manager in the face of\nadverse circumstances. He also has a valid\npoint when he speaks in his long awaited\nannual report of 'personality clashes'\nbetween himself and certain sabbatical\nofficers. At times it seemed that even if he had\ntaken out his wallet and offered to buy every\nmember of the committee a drink, they would\nstill have told him to bugger off. Still, I feel\nthat he could be even funnier if the union\nwould buy him a funny hat with bells on and\na pair of curly-toed shoes, although it may\nwell be that the best candidate for next year's court jester lies within the sabbaticals\nthemselves....\nAlan Rose - Internal Sevices Committee\nChairman Elect.\nBOOKSHOP NEWS\nLecturers, I must now start thinking about\nordering your recommended titles for the\ncoming Academic year.

    "content": "Letters\nNot a single\nexcuse\n\u2022\nDear Sir,\nI would like to comment on the ICU policy\nfor the appointment of student wardens for\nEvelyn Gardens. The adverts for any such\npost state that a married warden is preferred,\nindicating that a single one would still be\nconsidered. However, in practice a single\nperson would not get taken on under any\ncircumstances, as it is felt that they would not\nbe able to handle the job. For a mixed house,\nthere are definite advantages of having\nmarried wardens, but for a male-only house\nthere appears to be no justification for it. To\nsay that a single person could not handle the\njob, whereas a married one could is totally\nridiculous. In my experience as a( single)\nwarden of the Fremantle Hall for the past\neighteen months (a hall with more students\nthan any of the Evelyn Gardens houses), I have never found being single a disadvantage, as the amount of time spent\nrunning the hall would put severe pressure on\nany partner.\nAlso one of the main arguments for having\nstudent wardens (as opposed to staff ones as\nin the halls) is that they are not as remote\nfrom the students. However, married\nwardens are liable to be more remote than\nsingle ones.\nFinally, restricting the warden ships to\nmarried students severely limits the choice\nwhen appointing new wardens. I certainly\nknow of several very able single\npostgraduates who, as wardens, would\ndevote the energy and enthusiasm to the job\nthat the residents deserve. However, my\nexperience of present married wardens is that\nthey have very little interest in really getting\ninvolved with students. I believe that until the\nUnion changes its policy in the appointment\nof wardens we will continue to get second-rate wardens like the ones we presently have\nrunning the student houses.\nYours faithfully,\nNick James\nWarden, Fremantle Hotel\nRing out\nthe old...\nDear Sir,\nHaving seen the various letters and articles\nprinted in FELIX over the last few weeks I feel that I ought to set some matters straight.\nLast January I asked the C CU/MS C heads\nfor their next year estimates. Myself, Ian Bull\nand Ken Weale (ICU HST) had already\npointed out that we could not expect much of\nan increase from College at all. However\nwhen the estimates from the various sections\narrived it became clear that we were going to\nbe looking for a large increase.\nIn the end we faced an expected deficit of\n\u00a324k. We did not have as much money as last\nyear fo give to the MSCs and CCUs.\nTherefore UFC came to the conclusion that\nwe ought to start trying to make clubs more\nequal. Two areas immediately came to mind;\nsubscriptions and travel subsidies. On\ninspection it was seen that the amount of\nmoney the members of a club contributed\ncompared to that the Union gave varied\nenormously. UFC is therefore attempting to\nbring all into line.\nThe Union was to spend about \u00a332k on\ntravel subsidy next year. Again levels of\nsubsidy varied enormously and UFC agreed\nto make the travel subsidy standard.\nTours were\"originally seen as sub sidi sed holidays but it is now clear that some, at least,\nare necessary for the operation of an active\nclub.\nPreviously we had asked some clubs to\njustify their continued receipt of Union\nfunds. This was done to see how much value\nthese clubs provided. Next year the situation\nwill not be as bad as this, but no doubt, f uther cuts will have to be made and at some point in\nthe future (sooner rather than later) a club is\ngoing to be cut out from IC Union funds in\norder that the rest may survive.\nYours faithfully,\nDave Parry\n...ring in\nthe new\nDear Sir,\nI would like to, if I may, take up a bit 0/ space\nto remind clubs and societies that wish to\nhave a stall at Freshers' Fair next term, that\ntheir application forms must be returned to\nme by the end of this week. Any club which\nreturns its form after the end of term cannot\nbe guaranteed a space, and will be charged\n\u00a310 for their stall. And as for those clubs who\nturn up on the day without having asked for a stall...\nYours faithfully,\nDave Kingston\nICU Deputy President Elect\nRag madness\nDear Sir,\nWith the forthcoming production of our\nImperial Rag Mag after a year's absence I think the Union should seriously look at the\nwhole concept. The main aim of a Rag Mag is\nto raise money for charity yet the Imperial\noffering has consistently failed to do so. The\nUnion has laid great emphasis on the printing\nquality of our publication yet there is great\nresist en ce to a realistic price being charged.\nThe result is a Rag Mag which is unlikely to\nbreak even and incurs more cost due to the\nmethod of sale. In the past there were selling\ntrips to one college, which frequently cost\nnearly all of the money collected. This year\nsaw the development of Rag Mag selling\ntours, instigated by RCSU. While the trips\ncost less per Rag Mag sold this cost is still\nsignificant and the practice leads to Rag\nbeing associated with clique rather than the\nwhole student body.\nIf Rag is to raise money for charity via our\nannual Rag Mag there are two obvious\nrequirements. The price of the publication\nshould be sufficient to cover the full\nproduction cost with a significant sum\nremaining and this expected revenue should\nbe based on a realistic selling target. I see little\npoint in printing thousands of Rag Mags\nwhich will sit in boxes for years to come. Let's have a Rag that works for charity, rather than\npandering to the ego's of those involved.\nYours faithfully,\nNigel Atkinson\nAn Irishman\nwrites...\nDear Sir,\nI have just read the article 'Not a single\nhuman being' in FELIX705 and while I agree\nwith much of it, sadly it ignored a most\ninteresting type of student whose\ncontribution to the quality of life at this\nCollege has been inestimable\u2014let's call him\nPatrick.\nTypically Patrick was educated in a Christian Brothers School in a small market\ntown somewhere in Northern Ireland before\narriving at Imperial College where he\nproceeded to take the College and Union by\nstorm.\nNeither his small town up-bringing and its\nsole electoral doctrine of'vote early and vote\noften' nor his sometimes musical, most times\nincomprehensible brogue seemed able to halt\nhis inexorable progress towards the upper\nechelons of the Union.\nPatrick's only weakness is drink, his only\nenemy the police, and his only fault staying at\nCollege too long. A veritable human being\nindeed.\nYours faithfully,\nJohn Bull,\nThe Other Island\n4 Wednesday 19 June 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Records\nDespite the banality of the\nmusic, and the continuing\nrig ours of recession, 1984 had\nthe biggest grossing record\nsales in all time, and in relative\nterms, the biggest for over five\nyears. The beginning of 1985\nhas been even better and the\nfat men at the top of the\ncompany conglomerates are\nonce again showing those\nCheshire Cat grins of the mid\n'70's as they mercilessly\ncream off the rewards of the\nmusicians' hard work.\nSo why do we carry on\nbuying? Possibly the reasons\nrelate to the way young\npeople use music these days -wherever you go there are\nradios on, people wearing\nwalkman s. Perhaps it's the\nstill incredibly low album\nprices (where else in the world\ncan you still get an LP for\nunder \u00a38?) At Cut Price\nRecords on High Street Ken.\nyou can buy Top 40 material\nstill at \u00a33.99. Quite remark-able. Or perhaps we carry on\nbuying simply because we\nenjoy the music. With charts\nranging from the biting indie\nedge of bands like The Cult to\nthe ingratiating Duran Duran,\nthere really is something for\neveryone. Pity it's all so\nboring\nBands\nThe past year has seen the\ndemise of the gender benders,\nthe loss of omnipotence for\nDuran Duran. Even Frankie\nGoes To Hollywood no longer\nhave a guaranteed number\none, after people finally got\nfed up with buying the t we lv th mix of the fifteenth title of the\nsame song. Instead we have\nSoul one hit wonders (like\nPhyllis Nelson), producer\nstars (like Paul Hardcastle),\nthe return of political idealists\n(Billy Bragg), and the charity\nmega-hits. It's all the same. It's all so nice. It in reality\nchallenges nothing.\nAnd where in the past there\nhave always been new ideas\nbreaking on the pub scene,\nnow there is only more of the\nsame. All is retrospective, all\nhas rounded edges.\nMusic Radio\nStudents at IC are in the very\nfortunate position of being\nable to tune in to around\nfifteen music stations on radio\nat any one time, from the ever\nconsistent Radio 2 to the ever\nconsistent Capital! IC Radio\nplays your requests and chats\nin a surprisingly informed\nstudent manner (plug, plug),\nNnnn Paul Hardcastle\nthe pirates offer everything on\nthe musical spectrum( especially if you like Greek\nfolk dancing!) and even the\nestablishment Radio London\nhas been breaking new\nground with its reggae and\nsoul shows( despite the\nunfortunately irrepressible\nTony Blackburn) and Radio 1\nhas moved away from its 'Yes\nindeed y' reputation with the\nRankin' Miss P, imported from\nthe now defunct Dread Broadcasting Company. Capital has its all new (yawn)\nNetwork Chart, and Community Radio looms on the\nhorizon. True local community stations would completely\nchange the face of the radio\ndial. Which way, we can only\nwait and see. Another thing\nabout listening to radio: it's completely free. Stay tuned.\nThe Future\nThe story is always the same.\nIn the mid '50's the charts (as\nthey were) were full of old\ncronies and retrospectively\nbland music. Along came\nElvis and rock 'n' roll. In the\nearly '60's rock had been\ntamed when along came The\nBeatles and new vistas in Pop\nMusic opened before us. 1975\nwe were listening to (and\ngetting bored by) the same old\nsounds again, when the\nPistols and punk broke. Now,\nin 1985, knowing the problem\nmusic faces will not give us\nany insight into what the next\n'Big Thing' will be. We can\nonly hope, and while we wait,\nenjoy the brief trends; as Soul\nturns to Funk and then to Jazz\nnext year, as Reggae finally\nreceives popular recognition,\nand as maybe you become the next 'Rock 'n' Roll Messiah'.\nFELIX Wednesday 19 June 1985 19\n\n"

Fearing bad\npublicity the Rector persuaded\nthe RS M President to call the\nevent off at the last minute.\nHowever, a large number of\ndemonstrators still turned up and\nweren't easily persuaded that the\nevent was not taking place.\nShortly after the Christmas\nvacation it was announced that\nthe Rector would be leaving to\ntake up the position of Vice\nChancellor of the University of\nLondon. The search for a successor started soon after but\nnone of the more obvious\ncandidates wanted the job. Soon\nafter the announcement was\nmade Lord Flowers was rushed\nto hospital with a heart attack.\nHe was off work for several\nmonths and is still only working\npart-time.\nStudents in Evelyn Gardens\nwere told in January that work to\nimprove the properties would be\ncarried out in term-time,\nrequiring some residents to move\nthree times during the spring and\nsummer terms. Eventually the\nCollege was persuaded that the\nwork could be done in the\nvacation. The work was the first\nstage of improvements required\non all the Student Houses by\nKensington and Chelsea Council. The College has now\nagreed to draw up a timetable for\nthe remaining work to satisfy the\nCouncil and to avoid disruption\nduring term-time.

The Student\nResidence Committee (SRC )\ndecided to reduce the number of\nre-applicants who have a second\nyear in hall or house from 10% to\n8% overall.\nStill in January, the Union's finances were again in the news.\nThe Union Finance Committee\n(UFC) decided that Constituent\nCollege Unions (CCUs) should\nnot be able to carry over funds\nleft at the end of one year to the\nfollowing year. Next month the\ndecision was reversed by\nCouncil, meeting at Silwood\nPark. The attendance records\nwere broken as the CC Us brought out their full voting\nstrength to push the decision\nthrough.\nTwo successful Rag Mag selling trips were held in January\nand February. The first visited\nfifteen universities in four days.\nThe RCS party was banned from\nKeele and Loughborough and\nother complaints were received\nabout the Rag Mag's contents.\nHowever the two trips raised\naround \u00a32,500 and enabled Rag\nto sell off many of their large\nstockpile of old Rag Mags.\nEarly in February it was\nannounced that Michael Arthur\nwas to move from his job as\nStudent Services Officer in July\nto a position in College\nadministration.

    "content": "The truth about this\nyear's FELIX editor...\nWild\nRowe-ver\nA man 30 years too young for his age, with an\nattitude more suited to editing 'The Tatler',\nDavid Rowe is the definitive young fogey.\nHis penchant for tweed jackets, cricket, fine\nwines and cheeses is only matched by his\ndistaste of all that is modern. Indeed, it is his\nambition to be remembered as Imperial\nCollege's answer to Noel Coward.\nBefore his election as editor, David was\nre noun ed for his caustic wit, a lack of money\nand a liking of a night out with the lads and\nlasses. Before Dave came to College a night\nout ruined his promising career as a scout\nleader. Dave had taken some young scouts to\nSussex for a camp. Unfortunately Dave failed\nin his duty and did not keep the scouts\noccupied in the evening by teaching them\ncamp fire songs etc. Instead he invited some\ngirls down to the local hostelry. But when the\ncat's away The bored scouts occupied\nthemselves by sending dirty postcards to their\nhometown dign a tories, who provided a welcoming party upon the scouts return.\nDavid was promptly drummed out.\nScrewing at the Union's expense\nAs a chemistry undergraduate. David still\nliked a good night out. He only became\ninterested in FELIX after being nominated\nfor the post of Alternative Prospectus editor\nwhile drunk. But as David's interest in\nFELIX grew, so did the stories about his\nRowe-timeless dress sense\nsexual antics. Last year their were rumours\nthat David spent a great deal of time at the\nNUS conference drinking, 'smoking' and\nscrewing at the Union'sex pence. The other\nUnion representative, Hugh 'Noddy' Stiles,\nhad to console himself with a good pork pie .\nSuperstud\nIt was probably about this time Dave\ndeveloped a reputation for being a super stud. Regretably the truth is far more boring. One\nof Dave's best kept secrets c once rsa young\nlady who was well known in chemistry for\n'putting it about'. Whilst under the influence\nof alcohol, Dave invited her back to his flat.\nUnfortunately by the time she had removed\nher stockings Dave had realised his mistake\nand instructed the young lady to get into\nbed.... while he slept on the floor. He can't have had much sleep though because his\ngirlfriend was due to arrive at ten in the\nmorning!\nMilk delivery replaced by\nvintage port\nDavid's transformation from vagabond to\ntrue English gentleman occured last summer\nwith a session of eating in South\nKensington's best,, and most expensive,\nrestaurants so that he could review them for\nthe Handbook. Maybe it was the pressure,\nbut something persuaded Dave that he had\nthe wrong idea of what a good night out\nentailed . Dave attempted to turn the FELIX office into a select gentleman's club. The\ndaily milk delivery was replaced by one of\nvintage port.

    "content": "The year started on an optimistic\nnote with news of a possible new\nhall of residence on top of the\nSports Centre. Little progress has\nbeen made, however, and the\nfinancial viability of the scheme\nis in doubt. Further exciting news\nwas the proposal of science parks\nat Silwood Park and South\nKensington. Again, progress has\nbeen slow, but the plans are still\nunder way. Also during the\nsummer a new telephone\nexchange was introduced. As an\nexercise in causing the maximum\ndisruption and confusion it went\nvery well. For several weeks\ncallers found it almost impossible\nto phone in to the College.\nThe Freshers' issue covered the\nmajor crime at IC this year\u2014an\narmed bank raid on the NatWest\nsub-branch. A shot was fired and\n\u00a326,000 stolen. Also in the news\nwas the opening of the Union\nSnack Bar under the management of Norman Jardine. The\nfirst non-Mooney food in College\nfor many years was an instant hit\nwith students and staff.\nMeanwhile Mr Mooney's outlets\nwere continuing true to form\nwith a spate of incidents where\nbeef was being sold as lamb.\nA story which appeared in\nseveral issues of FELIX was the\nThe year Commemoration day\nSouthside fire alarm saga. The\nnewly installed system went off at\nall hours of the day and night\ncausing much annoyance to\nresidents. The situation is still not\nfully resolved although the\nnumber of false alarms has been\nreduced.\nwas interesting\nA division of opinion in the\nhigher ranks of the College\nhierarchy was publicly revealed\nwhen Sir Henry Fisher (chairman\nof the Governors) made his\nclosing remarks at the\nCommemoration Day ceremony\nin the Albert Hall. He openly\nBlocking bridges-does it help?\ncriticized remarks the Rector had\nmake in his speech minutes\nearlier in the ceremony\nwelcoming the broadening of\nsixth form studies.\nRefectories again hit the\nheadlines in November when a motion committing the Union to\norganise refectory boycotts if\nthere were further price increases\nwas passed at aUG M. Prices\nhave not gone up since, so there\nhave not yet been any boycotts,\nbut the policy remains effective\nuntil a new computerised pricing\nsystem is introduced.\nLater in the month the\nGovernment announced that the\nminimum grant would be\nabolished and some parents\nwould have to pay tuition fees\nfrom next year. There was a wide-ranging campaign opposing\nthese changes, including aNUS organised (or more accurately,\nNUS dis-organised) march which\nended in confusion and confrontation with the police. In\nthe end Sir Keith Joseph had to\nmake an em baras sing climb\ndown in the teeth of opposition\nfrom the middle-class Tory\nvoters who would be hit by the\nmove.\nCloser to home, the Union ran\ninto financial difficulties caused\nby a shortfall in expected income.\nJust before Christmas a3% cut\nwas imposed on all clubs and\nsocieties to avoid overshooting\nthe budget. Troubles of a different kind also afflicted the\nannual Hon Porn night\norganised by R SMU. Anti-porn .\ncampaigners had raised the issue\nat the University of London\nFELIX Wednesday 19 June 1985\n\n"
