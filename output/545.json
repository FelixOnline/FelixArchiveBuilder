    "content": "REVIEWS I THE SORCERER\nCheap! But that was only the price;\nthat one should also have seen a perform ance of Cox And Box in the same evening, made it all even better. Undoubte d ly, there were rough edges and mistakes in both productions, but all in all\nit was an enjoyable evening and representative of the standard of the Arts at IC. By way of explanation, Cox And Box was\npresented by Imperial Opera, a new society whose members are not at\nCollege, but have links with Op soc( IC\nOperatic Society), which is confusing, but\nthey like to maintain the distinction. The\nopera concerns two lodgers who both occupy the same room, but are unaware\nof the fact, as one works in the daytime\nand the other at night. The landlord (the\nthird and final character) cashes in until\nthe two men confront each other and\nafter a comic interlude identify themselves as long lost brothers. The casting here was questionable; might not\nthe stronger voice of Sgt Bouncer, the\nlandlord, have been paired with one of\nthe brothers, to prevent the rather one-sided duets that the brothers sang?\nOn the other hand The Sorcerer, the\nmain event, involved a cast of some forty-three people and was presented by\nOp soc. with the well-constructed set, the\nstage in the Union Concert Hall was a little too small for the chorus of villagers,\nwho had to cram themselves into the side\nof the stage to leave room for the main\ncharacters, but for all that, the singing\nwas clear and unified and the acting above reproach. It was to the orchestra's credit that during the performance they\nplayed as accompanists, rather than PHOENIX HAS RISEN\nIf literature is the reflection of life as we\nlive it, then this new, and excellently\nproduced, edition of Phoenix articulates\nthe lives of many of us at this College,\nand, I would suspect the lives of many in\nthis country. It is unfortunate but true,\nthat most student literary efforts are\nelliptical to the point of obscurity, mainly,\nI would suspect, to hide a fundamental\nlack of imagination. This is definitely not\nthe case with The Phoenix. Steve Marshall and his dedicated band ot\nhelpers have produced a journal (for want\nof a better word), the articles of which\nare in the main very readable and understandable. There were two or\nthree which I could not follow \u2014 the fault\nprobably being my own.\nBefore I come to the main subject of\nthis review, the way some articles reflect\nlife in this College, I will give an all too\nbrief account of some of the other contents, in order to give a flavour of the\nwhole. Both Steve Marshall and Mark Smith have spent considerable time in the\naft hives researching the past issues of\nPhoenix, and have reprinted, quite just if ably, some otherwise unknown material. There is a selection of writing\nfrom past editorials, reporting on such\nevents as the closing of the old Union\nBuilding to how to write for The Phoenix.\nBut, my favourite extract must, naturally,\nbe the account of S CC some quarter\ncentury ago, when it forbad the formation\nof the Methodist Society because it was\n'sectarian'! The real reason was that S CC was becoming too large with the formation of new societies, and had, for\nthe sake of administrative efficiency, to be\nsplit up into the major subcommittees.\nAlso reprinted, apparently for the first\ntime is HG Wells' The Chronic Argonauts.\nHG Wells, when he was a student at this\nCollege founded The Phoenix and published his early stories in it; he later\nconsidered them so bad that he attempted\nto destroy all back copies of The Phoenix,\nbut as will be appreciated without total\nsuccess. As is pointed out this early story\ncontains the embryo for both the Time\nMachine and Invisible Man. In The Chronic\nArgonauts we see the genesis of Wells's prose style and also why he attempted to\ndestroy the story since it does not really\nbear comparison with his later work.\nHowever, the story does stand up by itself\nand is most definitely worth reading to see\nhow Wells later developed the ideas which\nhe had as a student in this College.\nThe story is illustrated by modern black\nand white drawings and are of a high quality,\nespecially that facing the opening page of\nthe story by Ian Wieczorek. The general\nstandard of illustration in The Phoenix is\nhigh; there are two 'strip' cartoons, one in\nmodern style, which I did not care for\nparticularly. The other is in 'Victorian' style\nand contains pastiches in words and drawings of the secret thoughts of people in\na Victorian village, presumably inspired by\nUnder Milk Wood.\nThe theme which is prominent throughout the whole journal appears to be a description of the lack of basic human\ncontact in life today, which, ironically\nincludes being part of a crowd. This theme is\nespecially epi tomis ed by Ian Holliday's cartoon' Southside First Week', Ian\nWieczorek's poem 'So Different' and KC Mann's brilliant short evocation 'There Has\nNever Been Anyone Famous Called Trevor'. If there is any one in this College\nwho says he cannot feel any sympathy for\n'Trevor', then he is either a liar, very lucky,\nor Trevor himself! I cannot do full justice to\nthe story, but will simply say that it is a description of a man who fulfils all that is\nexpected of him, sacrificing, in the process,\nall hope of any deep personal relationship;\nbut at the same time he does not perceive\nthat this is what he is doing. KC Mann has\nnot only constructed a tightly knit essay, but\nit is minutely observed, without becoming\ntedious, and is tautly written.\nIn relation to this theme \u2014 essentially of\nthe non-realisation of any purpose of life \u2014\nIan Holliday's cartoon 'Southside First\nWeek' shows two students on opposite\nsides of a wall, wondering if there is anybody\nthere to be contacted. In the event of such\ncontact existing then Ian Wieczorek's poem\n\" So Different\" carries this to extremes and\nsuggests that people become \"one of the\ncrowd\", in other words people are not\ndifferent. He illustrates this by suggesting\nthat the \" crowd\" enforces its will on each\nindividual \"different you're not, sameness\nexudes\". This, it will be appreciated, returns\nus to the character of 'Trevor', who is\nshining through in their own right.\nTo give a synopsis of the plot, drawn\nfrom the comprehensive programme notes, the opera centres on the betrothal\nand marriage of a young couple who subsequently take it upon themselves to\nmake the inhabitants of their village a party to their own good fortune. To this\nend they acquire the services of J Wells\nand Co, Family Sorcerers, with unfortunate consequences, but (sigh of relief) a happy ending.\nLars Wernberq-Moller\nforced by conventions, un perceived by\nhimself to follow a particular path.\nIf the picture I have painted appears\ngloomy, it is not meant to be, but I see no\npoint in writing romantic nonsense which\ncannot relate to people's lives. In\nproducing this edition of The Phoenix,\nSteve Marshall has attempted to say\nsomething about the way we live, in this\ncollege in particular and in this country\n(and America?) in general. He is to be\ncongratulated in unearthing a collection of\nwriters and artists who are able to\nexpress, simply and with a considerable\namount of imagination, ideas about the\nway we live. I disagree profoundly with\nMacbeth's view that \"life is full of sound\nand fury, signifying nothing\", but we do\nneed to know where we are going and\nthese works in The Phoenix express quite\nclearly that we do not know, it is up to us\nto try and find out.\nFrank James THE PHOENIX\nThe magazine of\nImperial College Union\nFrom Bookshop, ICU &\nFELIX Offices\nPrice 20p10 "

    "content": "LETTERS\nDear Colin\nAs two of the \"infestations\"\nof the Maths Common Room\n(who have as much right to be\nthere as any other mathematicians) we would like to reply\nto the letters concerning ICWA\nin last week's FELIX.\nWe feel that I CW A does\nrepresent the views of women on\nCouncil since it holds general\nmeetings regularly (the next\nbeing on Tuesday 4th March at\n1:00pm in the ICWA Lounge)\nwhere relevant topics are\ndiscussed and women's opinions\nnoted. Katy Tatchell and Kirsten\nPratt are on Council to represent\nLife Scientists' and Mathemati cia ns' interests, whereas\nMerche Clark is there specifically to present women's issues.\nThere is also the possibility, in\nfuture years, of there being no\nwomen at all on Council, except\nthe ICWA President.\nThe point was raised that\nwomen do not have the right to\nchoose whether to be a member\nof ICWA or not. The same could\nbe said of the CC Us or even\nICU. The choice is over whether\nor not to take an active part v and\nunlike Opsoc and Ladies Rugby,\nno particular skills are required\nto enjoy the company of women.\nWe feel that our integration into\nCollege life has been helped by\nthe existence of ICWA, and\nalthough many women are able\nto get on in the College atmosphere, I CW A is present to\nbenefit the minority who cannot.\nYours sincerely\nCelia Martin\nLorraine Elston\nMaths 3\nDear Colin\nThere appears to be a misunderstanding around the\narguments for the retention of\nImperial College Women's Association. Fiona Sinclair\n(FELIX 544) has said that women\n\"can get on in a minority\". I agree, clearly women can Dear Colin\nRe Bernard Smith's letter on\nstudent grants and education\ncuts. The grants motion wa%\ninferring that London students\nshould get an increased grant\nin relation to provincial students.\nThis, I believe, is a selfish attitude\nsince we know the government is\ncutting back on education expenditure and the only way we\ncould get an increase is at the\nexpense of provincial students.\nSince attempts have been made\nto single out London University,\nand in particular Imperial College\nas a 'special case' it would have\nfurther isolated us from the rest\nof the student population, if\nmanage. They can get top Union\nposts and many take full part in\nsocial activities organised by\nmany other groups other than\nICWA.\nThe question is not, can we\nsurvive without ICWA (as we\ncan probably survive without lots\nof things, eg ICU!) but does\nICWA help or hinder the .status,\nwelfare and social life of women\n(and men). In discussing this\nquestion beware of being sidetracked into merely discussing\nwhat ICWA does or says at any\nparticular point in time and\nwhether it could have been done\nbetter. ICWA is always open to\nconstructive criticism.\nMany of the statements going\naround are gross misrepresentations of the truth. To take \u2022\nonly one example1: the ICWA\nnewsletter at the start of the year\nadvertised the German Measles\ncampaign organised by the\nHealth Centre, yet Fiona claims\nICWA wanted nothing to do with\nit. This startling piece of\ndeduction is based (I discovered)\non somebody somewhere forgetting to take away some\nleaflets given to them on this\nsubject.\nICWA is an umbrella organisation for any activities that\nwomen want to organise. ICWA\nis presently going through a difficult transition period in that\nmany of the traditional functions\nit organised, such as the Ball,\nhave ceased to be widely\nappreciated but not enough\npeople have yet injected new\nideas for social activities. Despite\nthis there have, this year, been a very successful Freshers Tea,\nChristmas Debate and a Bar\nNight, to say nothing of various\nsmaller events (trips to the\ntheatre and to self defence\nclasses).\nReturning to the question,\ndoes ICWA help or hinder?\nFirstly, it is not just because\nwomen are a minority that they\nhave some common interests\nand problems. The problem is\npassed. It would have been\nfurther evidence, to them, that\nIC students are self-centred and\nuninterested in students in\ngeneral.\nWe should be concentrating\nmore on the effects of the real\ncuts in education. Bernard has\nstated that we are opposing cuts\nin the 'increases of educational\nexpenditure'. This is a fallacy. Mr John Smith, the College secretary, has said that over the next\nfour years the College grant may\ndrop from \u00a330m to \u00a327m. In no\nway can this be called a cut in\nproposed 'increases'.\nAs far as the means test is\nconcerned, I would be interested\none of society at large. Women\nare still discriminated against in\njob opportunities and society still\nportrays the image of the 'quiet\nwoman at home' or the 'sexy\nwoman about town' or various\nother stereotypes. It is difficult to\nfind many television series with\nsay the hero a women engineer.\nIt does help to have an\norganisation where women can\nget together on a social level to\nconvince themselves that to be a woman engineer or scientist\ndoes not make you any more of a freak than the next engineer or\nscientist. You can often get the\nfeeling that IC is still only just\ntolerating women (I need only\nmention Mines male only\nfresher s' dinners as one exam-ple). For women to organise our\nown social activities does something to tip the balance\nback in our favour. (By the way,\nnone of ICWA's social events\nhave ever been women only \u2014 it\nis in the ICWA constitution to\nencourage social intercourse\nbetween men and women.)\nOn the welfare side, the case\nfor ICWA is indisputable.\" On the\nissues of ensuring adequate\ncontraceptive advice, abortion\nfacilities, in discussing security\nagainst attack at College, ICWA\nhas a clear role which it has\nalways played. Of course individual women can raise these\nissues, but a particular organisation or individual (eg, ICWA\nPresident) is needed whose job it\nis to look into these issues.\nTo those who argue that the\nexistence of ICWA hinders the\nprogress of women because we\nadmit to not being able to\nmanage as individuals, I will just\nask two questions. Margaret\nThatcher is Prime Minister,\nsimultaneously nursery education and facilities are being cut.\nHas, therefore, an individual\nwoman's success helped or\nhindered the progress of women\nas a whole? Secondly, if it is true\nthat the way to solve the problem\nof stereotyping women's roles\nto hear what Bernard is trying to\nsay, his first sentence in the\nsecond paragraph makes little\nsense. I agree that the means test\nshould be abolished and that all\nstudents should get increased\ngrants to take account of\ninflation, but surely at the\nmoment the most important\nissue must be cuts in education.\nWe must oppose them fully and\neffectively, otherwise the\neducation system in this country\nwill degenerate rapidly.\nYours sincerely\nAndy Nicoiaou\nEE3\nand discrimination in opportunities in this college and society is\nby ignoring the whole problem,\nand if women's special needs and\nproblems can be solved without\nany joint discussion amongst\nthose affected, shouldn't we\nclose down all. special interest\ngroups given any particular\nstatus by the Union, including\nthe postgraduate group and the\noverseas students committee?\nThere clearly is a case for the\nretention of I CW A with its\npresent status \u2014 not because\nwithout it women are weak but\nbecause with it we are stronger. I hope that all women who want to\ncontinue the battle to further\nenhance the status of women at\nIC will attend the next ICWA\ngeneral meeting to plan the next\nstage of the campaign.\nLove\nMary Attenborough\nMaths PG Photo by Mickie.\nThe FELIX Editor taking it easy in\nSt Stephen's Hospital last Tuesday\nnight. (See News In Brief story on\nfacing page.)\nDear Sir\nIt is my deepest regret to\ninform you that my opinion of\nthe weekly Imperial College\nstudent newspaper FELIX has\nbeen rapidly deteriorating. I discovered very little from the\nissues of the past six months\napart from a few pictures\nwhich are designed to provoke\nsexual excitement. Is this\nsuggesting the existence of a probable room for improvement,\nor is this a direct reflection of the\nquality of thinking among the\nstudents of a so-called highly\nrecognised academic establish-ment.\nA postgraduate\nPhysics Dept\n2\n\n"

In the first race Pete led\nfrom the start but was pushed all the\nway beating his Reading opponent by\n1 V2 lengths. He now had the Elite\nscull er in the final. Despite being a length down for most of the course his\nper server ance was rewarded when his\nopponent faded in the home straight\nand Pete sprinted through to win by\nsix or seven lengths.\nOur extremely capable ladies crew\nwere unfortunate enough to draw the\nCambridge University Womens first\neight (the female equivalent of the\nCambridge Blue Boat) in the first\nround. Despite IC's aggressive rowing,\nCambridge won easily and we had\nonly the consolation that Cambridge\ndestroyed all the other crews that they\nraced in the competition. It seems\nunfair that CU WBC was allowed to\nenter when neither of the Blue boats\nwere allowed to, it would have been a better competition without them.\nOur fresher s novice eight lacked the\nfitness and experience of the Oxbridge\ncrews who row six days a week. Consequently they lost by a few\n. lengths to St Peters College, Oxford.\nAil in all we came away with nineteen pint pots and two trophies,\nmost of which were suitably wetted\nthat night. Everyone who entered thoroughly enjoyed themselves except\nperhaps for the fact that the boat-house ran out of beer by the time the\nsenior crews had won, possibly because the ladies crew finished earlier?\nTEAMS First Eight: Tim Joslin, Steve Webb,\nMiles Fellows, Tony Reynolds, Chris\nGeary, Richard Fearnhead, John Urry,\nBill Bradbury and Steve Crampton.\nSecond Eight: Bob Maddocks, Steve\nCollier, Alastair Rowe, Pete Allen, Paul\nGerrard, Chris Adams, Ed Hobhouse,\nMatt Pritchard and Ian Simpson.\nLadies Eight: Liz Lindsay, Sara Gray,\nAngela Burgess, Jo Pearson, Ann To ney, Gwen Griffiths, No nie Ray,\nCathy Weir, and Bill Partridge.\nNovice Eight: Pete Te b butt, John Vedy, John Marsden, Stuart Allinson,\nRichard Redhead, John Marsden, John Har graves, Mark Agnew and Mark Canvin.\nS Crampton\nIC WIN SOUTHERN\nUNIVERSITIES REGATTA FOR\nSEVENTH YEAR RUNNING\nThe men's senior squad had a clean\nsweep at Reading last Saturday winning the Championship Eights, the\nsecond eights and the Championship\nSculling.\nThe first eight disposed of two\nCambridge colleges, Emmanuel and\nChurchill, at little more than a firm\npaddle and then drew Reading, the\nhost crew, in the final. This was a most exciting race in which the eight\ncame back from 3\n/ 4 length down and\ncoolly' rowed through to win by aV4 length. This is the seventh consecutive\nyear that we have won this competition.\nThe second eight after a tough race\nwith Oslar (Oxford medical students)\ncomfortably beat Emmanuel second\neight. In the final they met the defenders, Southampton first eight.\nAfter a disastrous start in this epic\nrace in which Southampton gained\nclear water, our valiant second eight\nrowed through them to win by a length.\nIn the Championship Sculls Pete\nICFC\nIt took IC fourths 195 minutes to\nqualify for the final of the cup against\nK CH seconds. The first match was a tense, hard-fought game which could\nso easily have gone either way. In the\nfirst half, IC really dominated the\ngame, pushing forward all the time,\ncreating several chance s.Andy Hartland scored from one of these and\nDamian Nnochiri hit the post with a powerful shot from the edge of the\narea. The second half started badly for\nIC with K CH pushing forward strongly\nthrough some good work from their\nmidfield. Their pressure paid off after\nabout ten minutes with them equal ising with a somewhat clumsy headed goal.\nUrged on by this, they started to\ndominate, forcing Steve Veats to make\nsome fine saves and Neil Morris to clear\noff the line. However, the defence stood\nfirm and IC, once more, started controlling the game, hitting the post\nand narrowly missing several times.\nExtra time had to be played and the\ngame ended in stalemate.\nThe replay started much the same as\nthe first match with a fiercely contested\nbattle in the midfield, but right from the\nonset IC's determination and confidence controlled the play. After five\nminutes Paul Galvin nipped in to score\nfrom Andy's flick on and then started\nthe rout. IC threw themselves into\nattack virtually pulver ising K CH. Their\nkeeper made several spectacular saves\nbefore Neil Redmayne got up to a corner to head in. From the very next\ncorner aK CH defender had to scoop\nthe ball off the line from Richard Dolan's effort giving a penalty which\nwas somehow saved by their keeper.\nIC started the second half\nas furiously as they ended the first.\nPaul scored with a neatly taken half.\nvolley after two minutes, quickly followed by Andy's first. Andy scored\nagain soon after having run through\nmost of their defence, and a few\nminutes later Quentin was bundled\nover in their area for another penalty.\nThis time Neil Redmayne took a short\nrun-up (over 25 yards) and slammed it\ninto the bottom right-hand corner. The\nperformance was rounded off by\nDamian smashing one in from the\nedge of the box and Andy getting his\nhat trick. The whole team was superb.\nThanks to super linesman Melvin\nand hope to see all of IC.

Guys opened the score in\nthe first quarter, but we equalise d at\nthe beginning of the second quarter,\nwhen Phil Thwaites passed the ball to\nBarry Ashwin and his shot hit the base\nof the post and went in. Guys returned\nto the attack and scored another goal,\nbut Barry equalise d again with a powerful shot from far away out.\nHowever, Guys scored one more by\nthe end of the third quarter. At the\nfinal quarter, Barry awarded a penalty,\nbut his shot hit the post and came\nout! We kept the pressure on and two\nmore shots by Nick Last and Adrian\nButler hit the posts! Another shot by\nPhil Mills just crossed the goal line,\nbut the referee thought it didn't and\nhe didn't count it! Finally, Guys scored\none more goal to make the final score\n4-2 to them. The score is rather heavy\nfor IC, who had a super game and\nwould have certainly achieved a better\nresult it they hadn't been so unlucky.\nTeam: D Roberts, N Buckland, A Butler, P Mills, N Last, P Thwaites, B Ashwin.\nIt was IC 2nds next, playing in the\nsecond division against London Hospital seconds. The opposition started the game very aggressively\nand they were 2-0 up by the end of\nthe second quarter. In the third quarter we pulled ourselves together\nand we started playing much better.\nNigel Chapman and Phil Sinclair stopped LH2 scoring and Bob Bradley\nand Colin Butchelor organised our\nefforts mid pool. Nick Ajderian passed\nthe ball to Pat Porter and he scored\nour first goal. At the beginning of the\nfinal quarter, LH2 had a shot and the\nball stopped on the goal line, but the\nreferee counted it as a goal, being\nunder pressure from the LH supporters!\nDimitri Papaconstantinou scored our\nsecond goal, after receiving the ball\nfrom John Heffernon, to make the final\nscore 3-2 to them.\nTeam: B Bradley, P Sinclair, N Ajderian, P Porter, J Hefferman, N Chapman, D Papaconstantinou and C Butchelor.\nWe would have produced better\nresults, if the referees hadn't been\nmarkedly against us in both games.\nActually, one of them admitted later at\nthe bar that LH2's shot didn't cross the\ngoal line!\nDimitri\n15\n\n"

    "content": "REVIEWS Adapted from Euripides and other\nclassical authors by John Barton and\nKenneth Cauander. Directed by John\nBarton. RSC, Aldwych.\nThis is an immense theatrical extravaganza in three evenings, a compression,\nor distillation of the Iliad thrown in for\ngood measure. You could try just the first\npart before deciding to see the remainder,\nbut buying tickets for all three saved me\ntwenty percent. Judging by the queue at\nthe box office, it's unlike y that you'll get a student standby ticket.\nWhile having no pretensions to a classical education, your reviewer did not\nenter the Aldwych theatre without some\nprevious ideas about the Trojan War and\nthe Ores fei a. You cannot look in any\ndirection of modern literature and drama\n(not to mention Chaucer and Shakespeare)\nwithout encountering a reflection of these\nancient stories: TS Eliot, JP Sartre and\nE O'Ne ill, to name but three, have reworked the Greek tragedies, and they\nare also the basis of the fair proportion of\nopera texts (\"La Belle Helene\", \"Elekra\").\nHowever, be not af frighted that this is a lot of high-brow culture; there's plenty of\nsex, violence, incest and buckets of\nblood. In fact, first-class family entertain-ment.\nAlthough the text is not stilted, neither\nis it as absurdly coll oi qui al as the recent\nTV drama tis ation of the Orestia. In order\nto compress the plays, John Barton has\ncut most of the longer speeches and since\nwe are seeing a complete cycle, the\nsynopses are unnecessary at the start of\neach play. There is therefore only one\nPrologue, a compilation of myths with which the Chorus( female throughout) set\nthe scene.\nBy seeing the full cycle, we see all the\nloose ends of the individual plays tied\ntogether, and therefore the stories you\nalready know are more understandable.\nFor example, it is easier to see why Orestes carves up his mother with an axe\nif you know that she killed his father\n(Agamemnon), in turn because he had\n( reluctantly) sacrificed his daughter( Iphigenia) to the gods.\nMost of the plays follow the standard\npattern of Greek drama, viz, growing conflict leading to a violent climax, in\nwhich actors charge offstage with vicious\nlooking weapons and their victims stagger\non bleeding. Only in the third evening,\n\" The Gods\" do we encounter the deux\nex machina; in each of the last three plays, a deity appears at the end of to\nsort it all out. My heart went out to John Shrapnel, as Apollo, who has a very tongue in cheek speech at the end of\n\" Orestes\" and, since this follows the only\ncomedy (\"Helen\") the audience are still\nrather giggly. In fact, the gods are treated\nas a joke throughout, especially the dum be blonde Thetis, mother of Apollo,\nwho can twist Zeus around her little\nfinger; Artemis and Aphrodite never actually appear but get cursed a lot and\nonly Athena( Billie Whitelaw) wants to\ngive the mortals a fair deal.\nBillie Whitelaw also gave a fine performance in the title role of \" Andromache\", the most substantial play in \" The Gods\". The difficult title role of \" Elektra\" was played very forcefully by Lynn Dearth.\nAchilles, the\" best warrior of the Greeks\", was played (by Mike Gwilym, who also takes the part of Orestes) somewhere between the pansy depicted\nby Shakespeare and the warrior of the\nIliad. After seen g his mother, one could\nonly expect him to be pretty mixed-up.\nAchilles' slave Briseis (Jenny Lipman), the\ncause of his row with Agamemnon( John\nShrapnel) was one of the strongest minor\ncharacters. In our opinion, the most outstanding actor was Edwin Richfield as\nTalthybius, the man who gets all the dirty\njobs like murdering unwanted children._\nThe direction is thorough and imaginative, and more realistic than any ancient\nproduction would have been. The Chorus MIKE RUTHERFORD\nSMALL CREEP'S DAY\n(Charisma)\nHeralded by a sticker on the cover which says: \" A Genesis solo album; Mike Rutherford \u2014 Guitars\". This is a superb\noffering, possibly the best of the 'splinter'\nalbums recently produced by members\nof Genesis (although Tony Banks' offering\nwas as part of Brand X). The first side is a continuous theme\nabout, oddly enough, Small Creep's Day( inspired by the book of the same name\nby Peter Cur re ll Brown). One of the\nseven sections, \" Working In Line\" is the\nnew single, which has been getting a fair\namount of airplay on IC Radio. The whole\npiece of music hangs together very well,\nbut each section is definitely different;\nmore so than the separate parts of the\nFloyd's \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\". It is, in fact, almost half an hour long, and\nalways have some business to at ten cj. to,\nrather than the static Chorus which the\noriginal production would have used,2,000 years ago. Purists might say that a director should keep to the author's intentions and attempt to reproduce the\nancient style of presentation; I suspect\nthat this would be extremely boring for a modern audience. Perhaps drama has\n\"progressed\" since 3 0 0 BC, so that even\nwithin classical forms and ancient texts,\n\"live\" theatre can be created. In the usual\nstyle of the RSC, a dance was interjected\nat each of many points in the cycle, and the grand finale is a sequence of dances.\nThe amplified music irritated me a little at\nfirst, but by the end the recurring tunes\nwere growing on me.\nOther reviews of this production have\nconcentrated on inferring a political message, some anachronisms are introduced in order to relate the action tp the\nmodern world; the soldiers' uniforms are\nalmost modern, and Orestes and friends\nuse machine guns. But there is no single\npolitical message. The use of an entirely\nfemale chorus, and the large proportion\nof speeches from female characters, seem\nto give the production a \"feminist\" slant;\nbut the message seems to be more about\nhow the Greeks treated women than about women in modern society. There is\nnot so much one message as one viewpoint of the subjects, as framed by\nthe selection of texts. The power of the\ngods is played down, and the motivation\nof human greed, jealousy and revenge is\nshown clearly. Even the characters come\nto realise that the gods they worship are\nreally aspects of their own personalities;\nand that Athena( Wisdom) is the god to\nfollow, rather than any other.\nStongly recommended.\nDerrick Everett\nis mostly instrumental with some vocals in\neach section, sung by Noel McCall a. The second side is composed of five,\nseparate tracks and opens with \" Moon shine\"; a track which leaves the listener in\nno doubt that this is by a member of\nGenesis. It's possibly the strongest track\non the album and reminds me oLa couple\nof tracks on the last Genesis album \". . .\nand then there were three . . .\".\nThe other tracks stand up well in this\ncontext, especially \" Romani\", which has a good melodic rhythm, yet rocks along,\nagain very much in the Genesis style. The\nsimilarity could be because the album is\nproduced by David Hentchell, the same\nproducer as Genesis use.\nI think that this is certainly an excellent\nalbum, even the sleeve design, by Hipgnosis, is very eye-catching. I have no\nhesitation in recommending this album to\nanyone; it's almost as good as a new Genesis album.\nJeremy Nunns\n9\n5\n\n"

The only reason given for not\nparticipating was that C CU activities\nwere childish and aimed at males. Over\nhalf of the replies were received from\nwomen not in college ac como dati on and 18 of these said they felt the need of\nextra contact with other women.\n60 women had previously attended\nICWA functions and of those who had\nnot the majority cited lack of publicity,\nmoney or time as their reason for not\nattending.\nBad publicity for ICWA functions and\namenities does appear to be a considerable problem; 28 women did\nnot know where the ICWA lounge is\nsituated and 130 women were unaware\nof all the amenities available to them\ne.g. coffee, newspapers, typewriter.\n83 women said they would be willing\nto participate in new ICWA events like\ntheatre trips, courses, squash ladders if\nthey were organised and 43 women said\nthey would be willing to help organise.\nThere was a great deal of confusion\nover the difference between WIST (a feminist group) and ICWA with 103\nwomen not aware of the difference. In a space left for additional comments\nreplies included 'uses ICWA to express\nfeminist views', 'ICWA is a form of\nsexual discrimination and does little to\nfurther the cause of women at IC, 'Now\nthat women are allowed in bars there is\nno need for a women's lounge.'\nAlso 'Disband ICWA and incorporate\nWIST with GAY SOC. Stop wasting\npaper and my time', 'Some of the women\npresently involved in ICWA are\nobsessed with men being dominant',\n'men-hating sexist organisation'.\nThe most obvious results from the\nanti-ICWA comments showed women\nwere unaware of the meaning of\nfeminism and a desire to prevent any\nfeminists taking an active position in\nICWA\nAmongst the comments in favour of\nICWA there were 'women at IC are\noppressed', 'I do think ICWA is a valuable institution','! feel it serves a purpose', 'There is a need for such a non-feminist women's group in such a male dominated college',Td like to see\nICWA propitiated in college. I wasn't aware of the amenities available in the\nICWA lounge but shall henceforth\nendeavour to take advantage of them',\n'It maybe another superfluous society\nbut why not have such a nice\nsuperfluous society'.\nTaking the comments as a whole 60\nwomen were generally in favour of the\ncontinuation of ICWA, 50 were against\nand the remainder did not express any\nopinion. Can the needs of these 60\nwomen be ignored?\nDebbie James\nFELIX acting Editor writes;\nThe interpretation of the replies to the\nquestionnaire was hotly disputed at the\nlast Union General Meeting.\nVJ\nu. a8 ROGER CHAPPELL, vice captain o the IC Rugby club, was elected Mr.I CW A for 66/67 at the Icwa party last\nweek.\nThe competition for the post had been intense. In his canvassing Richard Jackson even went to the extent of\nsending Valentine cards to all the\nmembers of the I CW A corridor in Beit\nHall.\nThe party was, however, marred by\nthe irresponsible behaviour of a number of ' gentlemen' attracted by\nthe free beer on tap. Many seemed lo be celebrating the IC Rugby team's victory to get to the final of the\nGut te ridge Cup. I CW A President had some difficult y in\ncontrolling the mob, with little\nassistance from the student officers\npresent.\n6\n\n"

    "content": "OUTLINE OF THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY\nINTO THE ENGINEERING\nPROFESSION\nPurpose: To review the requirements of\nBritish Industry for engineers (profession and\ntechnical) and the satisfaction of those needs;\nutilization of engineers; the role of engineering\ninstitutions \u2014 and the usefulness of registration\nfor engineers.\nInvestigation of British Industry, Engineering, and National Economic Needs.\nThe report notes the following problems\n(among others): many disappearing industries,\nincreasing import/export ratio, decreasing\nshare in world trade, low corporate profits, and\na corporate tendency to neglect exploring\nmarkets before production. Conclusion:\nengineers and engineering (the \"engineering\ndimension\") must be better developed and\nutilized by industry in order to become more\ncompetitive with high-quality, high value-added\ngoods.\nEngineering Dimension Analysis\n1. Engineers lack the status and recognition\nafforded them in other countries; low salaries\nand poor career prospects accompany the\nproblem.\n2. Corporations are reluctant or unable to\ndevote much money to developing new\ntechnologies necessary for competition (ie a starved engineering dimension).\n3. Firms do not utilise engineers talents fully:\nmost aren't advanced into upper management,\nlack of recognition for successes and failures,\ninnovation not encouraged.\n4. The engineers dimension must include\nmarket analysis and interaction; it is not\ndetached from sales.\n5. Supply of engineers is probably less than\ndemand; shortage of technicians (engineers\ndeployed as technicians); severe shortage of\nthe well-qualified.\nThe main recommendations are:\n1. There should be an Engineering Authority,\nset up by statute and funded by Government.\nIt would have about twenty members, most of\nthem being engineers, and would promote and\nstrengthen engineering within the British\nindustry and economy. The present Engineers'\nRegistration Board would be abolished and\nengineers would be registered through the\nAuthority.\n2. Registration would be voluntary but,\nhopefully, industry will take the lead by making\nit, \"in effect, a licence to practice\". A new code\nof practice would be drawn up, a a breach of\nwhich may led to de registration.3. There should be a three route course (to\ncombat status problems and the previously\nmentioned problems; introduces training with a \"synthesis of technical, human, and financial\nconsideration\" and the development of wider\nskills).\nThe totally new three-tier structure would be\nintroduced based on academic courses but\nbut requiring a programme of structure\npostgraduate training and experience. The three\ntiers of registration are:\n1. Registered Engineer (Diploma) R Eng (Dip)\nA four year undergraduate course leading to M Eng followed by two years in industry gaining\nexperience. For top 25% of engineers, (those\nshowing \"early potential for leadership in the\ndevelopment of advanced technology or in the\nmanagement of engineering operations\").\n2. Registered Engineers R Eng\nA three to three and a half year undergraduate\ncourse based on B Eng degree with appropriate\npostgraduate training and experience lasting\ntwo years. This course is slightly more basic\nand geared more towards preparation for\nmainstream engineering work.\n3. Registered Engineer (Associate) R Eng\n(Assoc)\nThis would be mainly part-time and sandwich,\nwith HE D sandwich and structured working\nexperience leading to registration in five years.\nThis would be for supportive roles in industry.\nThe whole system would have many opportunities for transfer and present engineers\nwould be registered in relation to the structure.\nThere is a proposal for an extra \u00a3250 incentive\ngrant per year for B Eng/M Eng students.\n4. Regional centres funded by the Engineering\nAuthority should be set up to promote training.\nEngineers should have a statutory right to paid\nleave for study.\n5. The Authority should initiate a programme\nto promote the importance of engineers in\nindustry espcially aimed at employers. Employers should review career and salary\nstructures to improve incentives and should\nsupport the training of young graduates. There\nshould be more exchanges between eng inner s in industry and engineering teachers in order\nthat engineers can impart more knowledge to\nthe students and that teachers can keep up to\ndate with developments in industry.\n6. Schools should keep options open as long as\npossible so that more students may be\nencouraged to enter engineering; mathematics\nand physics should be taught to the age of\nsixteen or later. More careers information\nshould be provided to encourage students to\ngo into engineering.\nOverall, the Report emphasises that British\nIndustry is declining and in order to regain a position in the international market, better\nquality goods, particularly manufacturing\ngoods, must be produced. This can only occur\nif more engineers are produced. The future\nengineer should have a commitment to\ninnovation and production and should have a greater social standing. The quality of\nengineers and engineering teachers should be\nimproved in industry, and there should be\ngreater access to research and a greater\nimplementation of ideas and new develop-ment s.

    "content": "SPORT24 hr PEDAL CAR RACE\nIn keeping with tradition, Guilds entered two teams in the National\nTwenty-four hour Pedal Car Race, held\nannually at Whitchurch Airfield, Bristol.\nTwo minibuses containing the teams,\nback-up crew and others, left College at\n10:30am on Friday and arrived in Bristol\nat 2:00pm, one hour before the race was\ndue to start. After a couple of practice\nlaps it was discovered that one of the\npedals on the men's car had almost\nsheared off and so emergency repairs\nwere made to it. This problem caused a great deal of trouble throughout the race\nand was undoubtedly the reason why the\nmen's team did not win their race, thus\nproving to Rolls Royce (the eventual\nwinners) that it should not need a \u00a33,000\ncar nor a research and development\nbudget of \u00a390,000 to win the race.\nUnfortunately, the problem meant that\nthe men's team started the race forty-five\nminutes late. The ladies' team also had\nmechanical problems at the start and they\nstarted the race twenty minutes late. Until\nabout 10:00pm, the men had to make\nregular pit stops in order to tighten their\npedal up, but then, someone thought of\nswopping the pedals round, solving the\nproblem for the next four hours. It was\nabout this time that some supporters\narrived in the form of Jamie, Bryan and\nMark, giving a boast in morale by their\npresence and a boast in speed by their\npushing.\nHOCKEY\nULU CUP \u2014 SEMI-FINAL\nQMC vs IC: 0 \u2014 4\nlf\u00a3 fielding one of their strongest\nsides ever, progressed to the final of\nthe University of London Cup at the\nexpense of a strengthened QM C side.\nThis will be the first time in seven\nyears that an IC side has reached the\nfinal and on this performance they\nstand a good chance of lifting the Cup\nas the climax of an otherwise average\nseason.\nDespite various delays \u2014 late arrival\nof one player and the captain's kit not\nbeing available \u2014 the IC side reached\nDytchleys in good time for the start.\nThey were met by a QM C side full of\nconfidence \u2014 the QM C team having\n'imported' three star players from the\nUL team who had in turn brought\nalong a coach load of supporters.\nThe quiet, conf' dent, carefree approach of the IC side should have\nwarned the QM C side of impending\ndisaster \u2014 the QM C side however\nwere too involved in an amazing series of warm-up exercises in front of\ntheir admiring supporters to notice\nthe warming up routine of the IC\ncentre-half.\nThe warming up routine of this\nsmall, quiet Malaysian player did\nnothing to indicate the ensuing havoc\nAt about 2:00am, the pedal broke again\non the men's car and so the car was\nbrought in for a lengthy pit stop whilst the\npedal was virtually remade. This also gave\nthe team a welcome break and a chance\nto get some sleep.\nMeanwhile, the ladies had overtaken\nthe Marrey Ferguson team who were the\nearly leaders, and were gradually\nincreasing their lead.\nAt about 3:00am, the heavens opened\nand the track became a mud bath. Anyone who went out in the car became\ninstantly covered in a thin layer of mud.\nThe rain continued until about 9:00am and the intervening hours were very\nmiserable. By this time, the members of\nboth teams were almost comatose,\nresponding only to the cry of, \" Oi, it's your turn next\" at intervals ot approximately six minutes. Luckily, there were\nno major mishaps during this rainy\nseason, but almost as the last drops of\nrain fell, misfortune( and Mar rey Ferguson) overtook the ladies' team when\nthe steering failed on their car. This\nneeded a lengthy pit stop to repair it,\ncausing the ladies to take the lead.\nHowever, this piece of bad luck only\nspurred them on to greater things and a tremendous push by the ladies enabled\nthem to regain the lead which they\nmain tin ed right to the end of the race.\nDuring this period, they. overtook even\nthe leading men's teams on some of their\nlaps.\nThe men's team, on the other hand,\nwere not so fortunate.

He admitted that he had never seen the hall as full, with people\nsqueezing into all the available space. The audience, which included many of the Professor's past and present colleagues,\nheard a glowing account of his many achievements, including little known facts\nconcerning his career. For instance, the\nRector admitted that he was offered the\nchair of Theoretical Physics before Salam and had turned it down! Following his introduction, Professor Salam started his lecture with a summary of the state of unification theory in1956, when he began his work. He proceeded to explain, in historical order, how he and his contemporaries developed a link between two of the fundamental forces of\nnature, the weak nuclear and electric forces. Using suitably simple terms he\nwas able to keep the attention of the audience for well over an hour, in what\nproved to be a brilliant and informative\nlecture.\nOf special note was his warm, humorous presentation; at one point nearing the end of\nthe lecture he turned to the Rector and quipped, \" Can I unify gravity? It'll take me ten minutes.\" This was greeted with tremendous applause.\nThroughout the whole lecture Salam was\nnot satisfied with just presenting present\nknowledge. He extended the ideas where\npossible to illustrate points for the future\ninvestigation. Indeed, the final ten minutes\nincluded much speculation on the possible\nresults from the bigger particle accelerators\nnow under construction around the world. He introduced concepts which seem very\nstrange, such as supergravity and anti gravity, with explanations which were\nscant enough to promote interest in those\nyoung physicists in the audience. He concluded with an optimistic look at the\nfuture and received a well earned and sustained burst of applause from the crowd. A vote of thanks was proposed by Professor Matthews from Bath University,\nwho was formerly Salam's supervisor during\nhis PhD at Cambridge. He added to the Rector's comments and clearly pointed out\nSalam's dedication to physics.\nThe thanks of the students present can best be expressed by their subsequent\ncomments. Many found it 'inspiring' as well\nas informative. The Professor must be\ncongratulated, not only for hj s achievements, but also for providing an interesting and entertaining afternoon.\nPER CAPITA SYSTEM Despite the Government's intention to\nmake all students unions funded directly\nfrom the University Grants Commission( which is how ICU is currently funded)\nthe finance and executive committees voted la\u00bbt Friday and accepted the principal that ICU should be financed on the per capita system( what all o the i student unions do), for the one year the\nGovernment allows it.\nThis entails an additional figure being\nadded on to the College tuition fees, which will then be passed onto the Union. Provision will be made for students suffering hard s hio. Picture of the an nua! Pedal Car Race held in Bristol last weekend. Three teams\nfrom IC entered: one Mines and two from Guilds.

The speakers on this occasion were Gwen Griffiths\nand Mike Brown.\nGwen, who was proposing the motion, claimed that to abolish I CW A would be a negative approach to the problems of the\nassociation, and although very little is presently\nbeing achieved, a change in the constitution\nwould enable members to enjoy more benefits\nthat the association could provide. In\nopposition to this, Mike put forward his view\nthat I CW A had once served a useful function\n(when women first came to IC) but now this\npurpose had d is app ered and I CW A is no\nlonger able to communicate with its members.\nThe motion was eventually defeated by a convincing majority.\nHopefully, future debates will be on the\nlegal is ation of cannabis, and euthanasia, publicity will be given at a later date. Everyone\nis welcome, and if you would like to speak\nplease contact me, via my departmental letter\nrack.\nDave Londale\nIC SAILING CLUB\nSaturday saw IC sailing team's third\nsuccessive victory over Oxford University. Two races were sailed in the\nextremely light winds. IC won the first\nrace by a narrow margin of V4 points\ntaking first, third and fourth places\nand several penalty points.\nThe second race was won in\nconvincing style with first, second and\nthird places at the finish.\nTeam: J Williams, D Coleshaw, J Baxter, C Patterson, N Ajderian and Jill.\n13\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS IN BRIEF\nFELIX FELLAH FALLS\nFRACTURING FOOT\nFIASCO\nThursday 19th February, London:\nToday at 12:30pm, FELIX Editor,\nColin Palmer, while heroically\nchasing a police car in search of\nnews, fell and severely fractured\n(and dislocated) his foot.\nAfter a cursory inspection at the\nhealth centre, Colin was rushed by\nambulance to St Stephens's hospital.\nA doctor there rapidly diagnosed\nthe trouble and sent him up to the\nX ray unit. (Mild concussion was\nalso suspected, but later discounted\nwhen the hospital staff discovered\nthat he always acts that way.)\nThis first set of X rays however,\npuzzled the radio graph er and a second set had to be taken. Even\nthen the problem was not solved and\na specialist had to be called in. It was\nat this point that Colin realised to\nquote: \"It's not just a sprained ankle!\"\nDoctors then decided that the\nfracture would have to be manipulated and an operating theatre was\nswiftly made ready. In preparation a local anaesthetic was administered in\nconjunction with a tourniquet above\nthe knee. All the while, Colin was\ntaking dozens of pictures . . .\nselflessly thinking of news for FELIX.\nAfter major surgery had been\ncompleted, a few more X rays were\ntaken for the hospital archives because of the 'unusual' nature of the\ninjury. It turned out that Colin's fracture approximated to a Les\nFranc fracture, a common discomfiture during the Napoleonic wars,\nwhen soldiers frequently had gun\ncarriages ride over their feet.\nColin will have to stay in hospital\nfor 48-72 hours until the swelling has\nsubsided. Then he will be in Dlaster\nfor between six to eight weeks and\nwill also be on crutches.\n(see picture left)\nJEZEBEL GOES TO THE\nPARK\nThe finish of the Pancake Race\ndid not see the end of the wetness.\nA heavy overloaded 1916 Dennis\nfire engine (Jez to her chums) sped\nto the site of an alleged fire.\nBravely ignoring the 'No Unauthorised Entrance\" signs, she was\nbrought to rest on the far side of\nthe Serpentine. After a brief hiatus,\nthe fire fighting equipment was run\nout, the suction hose placed in the\n' S erp' and ducks, drakes and rowing boats were soon scattered\nby salvoes from the newly restored\npump. A crowd gathered and the police kept their distance seemingly in silent admiration.\nIt was only as things were being\npacked up that a representative of\n'the establishment' stopped by,\nsaying it was OK by him but please\nask next time.\nThere was also a false alarm in\nI he vicinity of The Queens. Later\nthat day a fire engine called by to\ninvestigate.\nThis photo by Steve Groves was\ntaken last Saturday, outside\nHarrods, on the RCSU rag\nevent. A report appears on page\n4 but, we can add that about\n\u00a3140 was raised.\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS\nWEEK\nA voluntary service overseas on\nMonday night followed by a discussion heralded the start of Overseas\nStudent Week at Imperial. The debate on Tuesday about the\nmotion \"This House believes that\nWestern nations hinder the progress\nof the developing nations\" was\nattended by NUS President, Trevor\nPhillips, who spoke for the motion,\nand was opposed by Martin Stevens,\nConservative MP for Fulham. The\nmotion was carried, but without\nspeeches from the floor due to lack\nof time.\nBoth of these events and the\nInternational Fair on Wednesday in\nthe J CR were organised by the\nOverseas Students Committee, as|\nis the International Evening which\nis to be held in the J CR tonight.\nINTERNATIONAL FAIR\nThe International Fair was\norganised as part of International\nWeek by the Overseas Students\nCommittee. There were many stalls\naround the J CR on Wednesday afternoon, most of which had colourful displays, and books and\nleaflets available. The majority of the\noverseas societies present supplied\nregional food and drinks.\nThere were two films on Greece\nand one on Dakar, Senegal. And there was also folk-dancing.\nSeveral other societies, mostly\nreligious, also supported this event.\nThere was also aV SO( Voluntary\nService Overseas) stall, and a collection for WU S scholarship.\nThis event ws not as well attended\nas it should have been considering\nthe effort these societies had put in.\nFALSE ALARM\nA false alarm at the College branch of the National Westminster\nbank on Tuesday brought police\nrushing to College thinking there\nA/ as a hold-up. According to the\npolice, the alarm, which is triggered\nf there is an attempted hold-up;\nvas set off by a short-circuit in the\n3 PO line connecting the alarm at\nhe bank to the police station.\nFARE INCREASES\nThe fares on the coaches to\nand from H arlington are being\nraised to \u00a31.00 (an increase of 40p) from the start of the next session.\nThis was decided by the Athletic\nClubs Committee, with agreement\nfrom the clubs, in the preparation\nfor next year's estimates.\nAndy Smith, Secretary of the RCS Motor Club, holds the nozzle\nduring the first public showing of the capabilities of Jez, now\nrestored to 100% working order and ready for action.\nNURSERY EDUCATION?\nVarious parts of universities are\nbeing given the evil eye as part of\nthe cuts, and university nurseries\nand creches have not escaped.\nPrevious University Grants Committee ( UGC) policy recommended that universities should not\nsub sid is e creches or nurseries for\nstudents and staff with young children with money from public\nfunds. A directive from the UGC to all universities now alters this\nrecommendation to an instruction,\nwith 1st August 1980 as a cut-off\ndate at the latest. Yet only in\nJanuary, UGC Chairman, Dr Edward Parkes, defended university\nautonomy and told MPs that the\nUGC \"bends over backwards\" not to\ninstruct universities how to spend\ntheir money. Of course, not all\nthe money a university receives is\nfrom public funds. And some of a nursery's costs are covered by\nfees. But many universities will be\naffected by this directive, whilst\nprobably not saving much money\nfrom it. Birmingham, for one, is\nexpecting to close down its nursery,\nmaking a saving of about \u00a35,000\nout of a total annual income of\nover \u00a366 million.\nIn most universities this directive\nwill affect both students and staff\nalike and women in particular, meaning that they are left with two\noptions: not to come( back) to\nuniversity or to find some other,\nalmost certainly much less con-veni ent, nursery facility. Some fear\nin many cases the decision will be\nthe former.\nBOLLARDS AND PAVING STONES\nThe repairing and construction\nworks beside Southside are nearing\ncompletion. The work, which started\njust over a month ago, involves\nputting a dozen concrete bol lards and three wooden benches along the\nedge of the pavement by Prince's Gardens. One of the reasons for\nputting in the bol lards is to prevent\ncars from parking on the pavement,\nwhich not only cause inconvenience\nbut also cracks the paving stones \u2014 a number of which the College workman have had to replace in the\npast due to cars parking on them.\nTHEFT FROM LADIES'\nCHANGING ROOMS\nOn Thursday last week, two\nyouths were seen in the ladies'\nchanging rooms in the Union Building. When disturbed by a m>.n ber of the Ladies' Boat Club,\nthe two escaped across the Quad\nwithout being caught. It was later\nfound that a small amount of\nmoney had been taken from some-one's pockets, but it is thought that\nthey had not been given sufficient\ntime to take more than this.\n3\n\n"

    "content": "CAMBORNE FEBRUARY 1980\nOn the morning of Friday 15th February, ninety-seven Miners\ncongregated in the front entrance of Mines for the biannual trip\ndown to Camborne. Amidst the expressions, were the solemn\nworried look of the players to the exuberant chee ful look of the\nsupporters. The coaches departed at 10:00am, one to the\nfamiliar sound of Swan cans opening, the other to the quietness\nof Steve Gatley's Poker Ring. Three stops were endured on the\neight hour journey and at one in particular, Messrs Pryor and\nFlectcher 'commandeered* two female hitchhikers to accompany\nthe supporters coach, much to the chagrin of the players, and\nMr Hofmeyr in particular.\nArrival in Camborne at 6:00pm, realised the ineptitude of the\nCamborne School of Mines organisational capabilities. After\nchecking in at the many hotels dotted around Camborne, a few\nof us trooped off to the well-endowed leisure centre to watch\nthe badminton, squash and table tennis tournaments. Following\nan eight hour coach journey, none of our players felt fighting fit,\nbut nevertheless put up a great performance. Their badminton\nteam ran ours to a close second (5-0), while the table tennis,\nunder the leadership of General Julian 'Broken Finger' Norley,\ncrushed their opponents 8-2. The squash was a close run affair\nwith Camborne pipping us at the post 3-2, even though we won\nfirst and second places with love games through Dirk 'Bogart'\nRemijse and Ian Stevenson. We all then retired to the Tyacks\nHotel where there was a disco with an accompanying sign 'No\nDancing Allowed'! Many hours later we all retired, looking\nforward to beating Camborne on the morrow; little did we\nknow!\nSaturday dawned, bright and sunny, a vast difference from the\ncorresponding time two years previously. Camborne then\ninformed us that the football would be at 10:30am instead of\nhockey and the hockey would then be on an all weather pitch.\nThus there was a mad scramble to find braining shoes.\nCamborne being one of the most important football matches\nof the season, meant that the Mines first team had to stay in\ntheir hotel on the Friday night previous to the match, this was\njust as well since the bar didn't close until 1:00pm, and most\npeople drank too much.\nMorning came with us finding that Camborne played on what\nresembled a pile of manure. Both sides found it very difficult to\nplay on six inches of mud, especially since the ball didn't bounce\nor roll. The wings had quite firm ground with grass on, and\nconsequently most attacks came from this direction.\nMines went ahead through Tom Hanke straight after the kick-off, with Camborne equal is inga few minutes later. From then\nuntil the second half the Camborne goal came under constant\npressure. Ian .Stevenson put us 2-1 up with a tremendous left\nfoot drive from twenty yards out to the bottom left-hand post.\nLater Si'.kri Yahya made it 3-1 with some neat footwork in the\npenalty area. Camborne then had another attack, where in a puddle; the Camborne player and Stewart Briggs fell over each\nother, with a penalty the decision. That made it 3-2. Until halftime the Camborne keeper made some good saves to keep the\nscore down.\nThe second half started with Mines under pressure for five\nminutes, which then broke with a good move down the left wing\nwith Tom Hanke slotting in our fourth goal. Sukri made it 5-2\nwith an 'Archies' opportunists goal from outside the box. Later\nour keeper Mick Redwood brilliantly saved a penalty at the foot\nof the post. Tom's hat-trick goal came from an impossible angle\non the by-line after a good chasing run.\nIn the last few minutes a rare Camborne attack, due to our\nfull-back being injured, gave them a consolation goal to make\nthe final score 6-3.\nMost of the play was in midfield where the ball was being dug\nout of the pitch. This brought down the standard of both teams,\nthough on good ground it would have been too easy for us.\nThe keen second team players that filled the gaps, Iain House\nand Stewart Briqqs. and also Ian Stevenson from IC fitted in\nvery well with Ian and Tom competing for man-of-the-match\nThe game was really made by the many supporters who raised the standard of both teams on a difficult surface.\nThe hockey started immediately afterwards, and with plenty of\nsupport from the touch lines, RS M soon took the lead. With Generals Steve Gatley and Ian Crowe in midfield, RS M never\nlost control of the game. Myself not being an expert at hockey, I could not detail amongst the swinging sticks, who in fact were\nthe scorers. We won comfortably 4-1 and congratulations go to\nMike Langley who survived the match without a cigarette.\nWe now had one hour until the start of the Bottle Match. This\nwas plenty of time to stock up on the food and alcoholic stakes.\nThe Bottle, which stands behind the Union Bar, has been played\nfor between RS M and C SM since 1945, although this contest\noriginally started in the 1920s. The rivalry between the only two School of Mines in the\ncountry is intense and most of the prestige of the weekend and\nof the successive year lies in the winning of the Bottle.\nKick-off was due at 3:00pm. Westward Television were there\nand so was our resident reporter in Cornwall; Colin 'Cheers'\nPalmer. The two teams came onto the field to an enormous roar\nfrom the 300+ crowd. RS M immediately took control and after\nfifteen minutes, Bryan Mecklenbergh charged down a kick, fell\non the ball and scored. Five minutes later, RS M won a scrum on\ntheir ten yard line, Dave Rhodes received the ball, and proceeded to make one of the most incredible breaks I 've ever\nseen in a rugby match. After sidestepping six men, he passed to\nAndy Lewis who tripped and dived a full ten yards over the line\nin the corner. The game remained in the Camborne half with\nconstant pressure from the RS M forwards and with beautiful\nprobing kicks from Dave Rhodes. The next try came from a scrum on the twenty-five. By making use of a well-rehearsed\nmove in the centres, Paul Atherley on the left wing had an\noverlap and scored; Keith Maynard converted. At half-time RS M were140 in the lead. Immediately after the turnaround. Maynard added a penalty and a short while later added a second\n(20-0). But in the true style of the Bottle match, Camborne did\nnot give up and they did apply short bursts of pressure in the\nmiddle of the half. With time virtually gone, RS M launched an\nassault on the Camborne line. After one disallowed try, Dave\nH of me yr started to find a lot of room at the base of the\nscrum and eventually finished off a lovely move which was\nhandled by many of the team. The final score stood at 24-0, the\nhighest ever margin; the previous highest being 20-8 in 1938!\nFolowing a rather disorganised supper in the evening we duly\ncelebrated in the bar, to pour onto the coaches at 12:30 and\narrive bleary-eyed at South Kensington at 7:30am.I would like to thank all the players for their wonderful team\nefforts and thank all the supporters for the magnificent encouragement they gave to all teams.\nThanks Bernard Pryor\nWith football report by Steve Hinde.\n\n"
