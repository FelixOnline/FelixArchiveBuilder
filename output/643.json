    "content": "The Lauwerys Report on Student Residence has\nbeen described as one of the most ludicrous\ndocuments the Sherfield Administration has\nproduced. Here Selkirk Subwarden Ken Baldwin\nanalyses its strengths and weaknesses, and puts an\nalternative viewpoint.\nOn the Sharp End\nof Student\nResidence\nThe recent review of College student residence known as the Lauwerys\nReport has already provoked some discussion in these pages.\nNaturally\u2014since after examinations and the sexual imbalance the\nbe gig ge st worry for IC students is accommodation. However the\nlimited circulation of the Lauwerys Report has meant that its\nimplications have not been made apparent to the vast majority of\nstudents. This is why this article has been written.\nBut why not just write a letter\nto the editor? The reason is this:\nno sub wardens were consulted in\nthe report, no sub wardens appeared on the distribution list,\nand no sub wardens were asked\nfor comments on its recommendations. Yet the Lauwerys\nReport recognises the special\nrole sub wardens have to play in\nresidence, living as they do\namongst the student population.\nIt is the sub wardens who are on\nthe sharp end of student residence, while it is the wardens\nwho take the overall responsibility. Now that I'm nearing the\nend of my time as sub warden it\nwould be easy to let all this slip\nby, but to do that would be to\ndevalue much of what I 've pul\ninto the last three years. So\nSoapbox provides the opportunity to express my ac cum mula ted thoughts on student\nresidence and simultaneously\ncomment on the timely release of\nthis residence report.\nThe Lauwerys Report is one\nof those documents which are\nhard to condemn or praise as a whole. It has many good points,\nnot the least of which is its\ncommitment to expanding student accommodation. But it\nis a curiously inconsistent\ndocument, with the recommendations sometimes contradicting completely the discussion\nleading up to it. Two examples\nwill serve to illustrate this:\nObservation: In the difficult\nfinancial climate the residences\nmust take second place to the\nCollege's teaching and research\nactivities.\nRecommendation: Appoint an\nexpensive (\u00a316,000pa) Residential Services Manager (RSM)\nto administer the residences.\nMy comment: The last thing\nresidences need is a high-price\nbureaucrat, out of touch with\nresidence life, to dictate how-residences should run. Closer\nconsultation with wardens (who\ntogether with their housekeepers\nand sub wardens are much better\nable to judge the needs of the\nHalls or Houses) is what is needed,\nneeded.\nObservation: Wardens and\nsub wardens are essential for\n1981). The financial saving of\nthe current reduction after the\nRSM's salary has been deducted\nis a paltry \u00a36,000pa \u2014at the\nsacrifice of the wellbeing of\n1.400 students. Is the possibility\nof one breakdown or suicide\nattempt worth this much?\nFurthermore the report recommends that post grads now\nbecome eligible for Hall warden-ships. Not only do most post-grads lack the experience for the\njob. but they simply cannot\nafford the time to take total\nresponsibility for the running of\nThe Lauwerys Report is a curiously inconsistent\ndocument; its recommendations sometimes completely\ncontradict its conclusions. It says that because of\nfinancial constraints residence must take second place\nto teaching, then recommends the appointment of a manager at a salary of \u00a316,000. It says that wardens are\nessential for social life in Halls, then recommends that\nwardens be cut by a third. In other areas the report\nsimply sidesteps issues completely.\nwelfare, discipline and social life\nin the Halls.\nRecommendation: Cut the\nnumber of wardens and sub-wardens by a third.\nMy comment: The last time\nHall wardens were cut I spoke\nout against reducing the war-den/student ratio given the high\npressure environment of a competitive college located in\nCentral London (FELIX, May\na hall of nearly 200 students. The\nreport also cuts the terms of\nwardens and sub wardens, reducing the stability and continuity of Hall life to the level of\nhostels or barracks. If College is\nafraid of vegetating incumbents\nthen they should make wardens\nand sub wardens re-apply on\ntheir merits, and thus assure that\ngood people are not lost through\narbitrary retrenchment.\nIn other areas the Report\nsimply sidesteps the issues\nentirely. Here is a list of the main\naspects of Hall life for which the\nReport's recommendations are\ninadequate:\nStudent Residence Committee: This is the main body\ndetermining residence policy and\nas such should be representative\nof all residences. The report\nwants to cut the number of\nwardens on SRC and replace\nthem with College appointees,\nthere b v making it less representative. Further, there are no\nsub wardens' representatives\nwho, as I have said, are closer to\nthe student residents almost by\ndefinition. There are no student\nresidents representatives on the\nSRC ar all apart from two union\nofficials who by their independent nature are not always\ninterested or sympathetic to\nresidence issues. A representative from Hall and House\nChairmen is required here to put\nthe residents' views\u2014after all\nthey are the people whom the\nCollege residences serve.\nFood: This is the biggest\nsidestep in the whole document.\nThe report recognises that\nrefectory food is mediocre\n(appalling would be a better\nword) and that this causes\nimpossible overcrowding in Hall\nkitchens not designed for mass\ncooking. Instead of calling for\nvast improvements in College\ncatering the report recommends\nturning laundries into kitchens,\nthereby transferring the over-Page2I May 6,1983 IFELIX\n\n"

    "content": "IREVIEWSI\nScrew Archimedes\nI'm sure that most reviewers approached\nEureka 18 directed by Nicolas Roeg, now\nplaying at the Odeon Kensington, with a degree of trepidation. Mr Roeg's films are\nnever straightforward, and one is always\nworried about s lagging him off for fear of\nhaving missed the whole point of the film.\nNevertheless, I shall bite the bullet: this film is a load of crud.\nOur hero Jack McCann (Gene Hackman) is\na gold prospector down on his luck in snowy\nCanada. Having all but given up, he slumps\ndown beside a tree with the wolves sniffing at\nwhat they evidently consider an interesting\nhors d'ouvres. Now things get silly: flash bang\nwallop, a stone falls into his hand, a fire starts\nand frightens the wolves away. He staggers off\nto the local hotel-cum-brothel which is run by a gipsy type who for tells his fortune will be made\nand then tells him what she and her dead\nhusband (probably dead from exhaustion)\nused to get up to. He finds the gold, becomes\nhideously rich, acquires a Greek island, a wife,\na daughter and a son-in-law in that order and\nthen gets bored. He becomes paranoid and\nbelieves himself beset by 'gold diggers' after his\nmoney. He despises his son-in-law who\ndespises him for finding rather than working\nfor his fortune.\nWell, the rest of the plot is equally silly\ninvolving gangsters and rather spectacular\nmurder for no readily apparent reason. The\nfilm is inexplicably set in war time and there\nare many factual errors. Roeg implies that this\nis i and sanctuary is passed by in the war raging\non the continent; however, at one point his\ndaughter mentions Rhodes which was Italian\nowned and forcibly occupied by the allies in\n1943. But this is mere carping over detail\u2014it\njust seems strange the way the American\ngangster is able to move so freely in such\nFriend or Fo?\nDario Fo in his classic Mistero Buffo,\nRiveioidc Studios, Hammersmith.\nFriend or Fo indeed. One of the greatest\ntalents in contemporary European Theatre,\nactor, director, clown, mime artist, spokesman\nfor political theatre and author of the hugely\nsuccessful Accidental Death of An Anarchist,\nCan't Pay Won't Pay! and Female Parts,\nDario Fo draws enemies as well as audiences.\nThe jovial communist hasn't just suffered\nendless censorship s at his adversaries' hands.\nSeveral bold and determined attempts have\nbeen made to run him over (nasty Italian habit\nthat). He has suffered police harassment,\nevictions, kidnapping and imprisonment and\nhas even been in gaol. His wife and co-author,\nFranca Faine, has been abducted and beaten\nup. He's an extremely likeable man but it is his\ncommunism that gets people you see. (In May\n1980, Fo and Rame were denied entry visas\ninto the US. The time was 'not opportune for a visit' according to the American Consul in\nMilan.)\nSuch experiences are enough to make the\nmost hardened individual bitter. Not so with\nDario Fo. On the contrary, he has a positive\ni ust for life and a marvellously large and\ncontagious smile. Slightly corpulent with a little\nwhite hair, he is what one imagines a merry\nmonk to be.\nLike all Italians, Signor Fo uses his arms for\ndramatic effect. 'Sono magn if iciest upend i' he\nsays of the Pope's veste mtn s with an\nexpansive gesture of the arm. 'Fantastici\nGloriosissinni' he grins. Like his plays, he is\ndangerous times.\nRoeg's style of editing consists of putting the\nfilm through a shredder and then glueing the\nbits together as seems appropriate. This is an\ninteresting effect and can often be used to\nemphasise a point, as in Bad Timing, but here\nit merely adds to t ne confusion. It is a pity that\nhe ruined what might have been a good idea\nwith bad screenplay. Some of the violence is\nunnecessarily gruesome and there are no\nreally good performances, although 1 suppose\nGene Hackman acquits himself pretty well.\nBut, if you want to see this man at his best, see\nCarnal Knowledge instead.\nSure of its footing, audience and approach\ncomes Friday the 13th Part 3, 18, director\nSteve Miner, playing from May 12. Anyone\nwho saw the two previous parts will know what\nto expect, but for those of you who remain in\nblissful ignorance I shall explain. This is full\nfrontal no holds barred horror, gratuitous\nviolence ai its wu iai, and a real tour-de-force of\nblood and guts. While not a devotee of this\ngenre, I recognise a masterpiece when I see it.\nDespite all the gore they produce, horror\nfilms often have a puritan streak in them. In\ntime honoured fashion, eight teenagers set off\nfor a dirty weekend in a remote cottage and\none by one are dispatched in gruesome and\nhigly imaginative manners. The moral is\nsimple: stay at home and be good or the nasty\nbogey man will come and cut your head off.\nThis film continues the modern renaissance of\n3-D, and you sit there with your specs on and\ngasp as things leap out of the screen at you. I suspect that its use will still be limited to the\nschlock-horror end of the market as this is\nwhere the greatest effect can be obtained,\nmaking the audience cringe and squirm in\ntheir seats, unable to detach themselves from\nthe gruesome goings on on the screen.\nI must admit I found it all rather entertaining\nand in very bad taste Lee pf ld don Here comes the chopper to chop off your head-Friday the 13th. WALKABOUTLOOKSEE\nby Mobile Optics Inc.\nBntain's first ever Cubist exhibition has just\nopened at the Tate Gallery. It's not a light-relief-from-revision exhibition: it's a superb\ndisplay, in highly concentrated form, of the\nessence of Cubist 'reality'.\nThe exhibition has been selected and\ncatalogued by Douglas Cooper, writer,\ncollector, and friend of Braque and Picasso,\nand by the American art historian Gary\nTinterow, and does indeed present 'The\nEssential Cubism'.\nApproach via Benin\nThe roots of Cubism are in Cezanne's painting\n(pop into the National Gallery for a start) and\nin primitive Negro art (the Benin bronzes\ndisplayed at the Royal Academy last term).\nCezanne had achieved a compromise\nbetween the European tradition of naturalistic\nillusion and a self-sufficient pictorial\ncomposition. African sculptures and masks\ninspired a new freedom of form and technique.\nThe re suit of these influences was Picasso's recognition that 'A head is a matter of eyes,\nnose, mouth, which can be distributed any way\nyou like\u2014the head remains a head'. And so art\nbecomes an act of creation rather than\nimitation.\nThe first part of the exhibition is concerned\nwith the balance between the internal reality of\nthe pictures and the violins, glasses, figures\nand guitars they refer to. The fusion of at least\nthree viewpoints in one pose in Braque's 'Grand Nue' (1907-8) represents the starting\npoint. Picasso's 'Seated Nude' of 1910 emerges\nfrom the background by spotlighting and\nthrough the graceful lines of her breasts and\narms and the curve of her neck. By 1912 the\nanalysis of things seen has become almost\nmonochromatic and is so complex as to\nobscure the link with external reality, making\nthe original object, at the least, very difficult to\nrecognise.\nFrom this apparently dead end came the\nfast moving and bouncy.\nRiverside Studios have just opened with his\nfamous Mistero Buffo (Funny Mystery).\nThis is also Fo's British debut.\nMistero Buffo is a unique, original and\nhilarious spectacle. It is inspired by the\ntradition of the gi ul lari, the medieval strolling\nplayers and storytellers of the Po Valley who\nbus ke d and performed to the peasants of\nEurope in squares and piazzas, frequently on\nthe run from persecution and censorship.\nMistero Buffo combines popular legend,\nnewspaper, farce and entertainment with\npolitical and cultural satire and discussion with\nspectators. It has lost none of its contemporary relevance, and in the sketches Fo\nattacks bigotry, repression and blind\nobedience to authority.\nThe first half of the show consists of three\ngram me lots. The gram melot originated in the\n15th Century as a means of evading\ncensorship. It was a kind of garbled speaking,\nlevin g spectators to appreciate what was\nintended through bodily gesture instead\u2014if\nthey had sufficient imagination. Fo has\ndeveloped a form of gram melot, a totally\non oma top aei c sound system in which few\nrecognisable words, if any, occur, but\naccompanied by a highly expressive body\nlanguage. Fo's gram melot is adapted to any\nlanguage (including American) and is even\nextended to represent sounds of machinery at\nwork. It is also very funny.\nThe first is the The Hungry Zanni. Zanni\nwho is directly related to the peasants of the\nPo Valley, imagines in his hunger that he is\neating himself and goes on to eat people\nstanding around listening to him. He then eats\nthe mountains, and even God!\nIn Scapino's Teaching Lesson we see a tutor\nwho, at the death of the lord of the manor in\n18th Century France, has to instruct the\nyoung successor and son of the deceased in\nthe arts, manners and typical attitudes of those\nin power.\nIn The Technocrat, Fo delivers a potted\nhistory of aviation (a bit in the Donald Duck\nstyle). He uses his American gram melot without saying a single comprehensible word\nDario Fo-conscience of an age\not English. The Technocrat has as its main\ncharacter a great scientist who gives a lecture\nand demonstration on the infallibility of the\nscientific method and the superiority of\nmodern man due to the technological\ndevelopment of flying.\nThe second half of this great show takes on\na flavour of mockery and subversion. In The\nResurrection of Lazarns, set in the cemetary\nat Pisa, Fo plays a whole crowd of astonished\npeople having come to see Christ 'do a miracle'. The main motif of this sketch is a satire on everything that contributes to the\n'mystical experience'.\nAnd finally, Bonifvace VIII (a bad Pope),\npaints the Popie of the 13th Century preparing\nfor a procession by putting on the various\ngarments symbolising his temporal power. At\nthe same time, another procession crosses the\ncity: that of Jesus Christ on his way to Calvary\n(a common element in Italian folk tales).\nHardly surprisingly, these two play lets aroused\nbitter argument with conservative Catholic\nclergy and elements of the Italian Christian\nDemocratic Party.\nIn Mistero Buffo, Signor Fo begins each\npiece by talking about its origins and\nbackground. He intersperses all this with jokes\non diverse topics: Italian bankers and the\nBlackfriars Bridge, the Falklands War, the\nPope. He doesn't speak a word of English\u2014he\nspeaks in Italian throughout, but this doesn't hinder one's enjoyment or understanding in\nthe least. An interpreter and subtitles are on\nhand at appropriate points, however.\nIt's an extraordinary thing that although Fo\nhas performed his Mistero Buffo literally\nthousands of times in Italy, his performance\nseems totally fresh and spontaneous. He is\nindeed a very rare comic genius.\nMistero Buffo is on until May 15 or until\nSignor Fo is arrested\u2014whichever come\nsooner.

This is as e ige town, holding its breath in\nanticipation of the weekly invasion of hordes of\nChelsea fans, where the cavalry wear blue and\narrive well before the nick of time, in green\ncoaches.\nBeyond lies a no-mans-land of low rise\ncouncil blocks and then on to posh Fulham.\nThe drabness of the Fulham Road belies this\ndescription but then it is merely a kind of\nalimentary canal y 'on't ask which end is\nwhich) serving a monied hinterland.\nAs with all alimentary canals, food is a major\npreoccupation and many are the establish-mew nts which have sprung up to cater for\nthose inclined, on occasion, to defrost their\nNeff ovens and Poggenpohl fitted kitchens. At\nthe Fulham Broadway end, the only eating\nplace of note is FAWLTY TOWERS (516\nFulham Rd, 736 0240), marked more by its\nmemorable eccentricity than its unmemorable \u2014 but perfectly edible \u2014 food, this\nestablishment attempts to recapture the\natmosphere of its TV comedy namesake.\nParticular attractions are the obligatory rat\nsandwich start featuring a large plastic rat,\nvarious nas ties falling out of the rafters into\nyour soup and endless John Cleese tapes\nmono poli sing the sounds system. The waitress\nvolunteered the information that the\nrestaurant is very popular with office parties\nwhere apparently this kind of behaviour is\nconsidered rather a hoot. Prices are somewhat\nabove the Gastropod norm but if you are\nthinking of organising an office party, no doubt\nyou will find the extra well worthwhile.\nWell into the posh bit: CARLOTTES, good\nfood and a fairly live pianist, but can be a bit\ntru quer a plus les oe uvres d 'art'.\nSynthetic Cubism\nAs well as playing on art's relation to reality,\ncollage represents a new concept in art that\ngoes beyond the technique of cutting and\nsticking. The picture surface is now the\nfurthest point from the observer, not the\nnearest. The space which was an illusion just\nbehind the surface, is now on or just in front of it.\nPlanes and lines appear to interact on a platform in telephoto compression. And, just\nas papier s colle s can be applied to a canvas, so\ncan painted planes, resulting in simpler, more\nlucid compositions\u2014Gris' 'Watch' (1912), and\nPicasso's 'Pierrot and Harlequin' (1920) are\nparticular beautiful examples.\nIn the synthetic phase of Cubism, representation of reality is the aim rather than\nthe starting point and reality is seen to lie\nbe yong objective perception. 'Nature and art\nbeing two different things cannot be the same\nthing', Picasso wrote. This, maybe, is the\nessential message ot Cubism \u2014 through a revolution in artistic style it expressed a new\nmeaning of 'reality' in art, a meaning which\npervades the 20th century.\nWhere? When? \u00a3?\n'The Essential Cubism 1907-1920' is at the Tate\nGallery, Millbank until July 10. The exhibition\nis open Monday to Saturday 10:00-17:50,\nSunday 14:00-17:50. Admission \u00a31 for\nstudents, otherwise \u00a32.\nexpensive, especially if you succumb to the\ncocktails.\nRED ONION BISTRO (636 Fulham Road, 736\n0920)\u2014calling this place a rip off, I am giving it\nthe best review it is ever likely to get.\nCROCODILE TEARS (660 Fulham Rd 731\n1537): actually, they don't even weep crocodile\ntears when they hand you the bill but, apart\nfrom k the fact that it is over-priced this is a fairly acceptable eating place. A trendy wine\nbar on the ground floor leads, via a trendy\nspiral staircase, to an even trendier eating\nplace in the basement. Food is of the Chicken\nKiev variety abd oi\nKiev variety and portions can be on the small\nside, but the waitresses are pretty and the wine\nis good, so what the hell!\nPIZZA THE ACTION( Geddit?) (678\nFulham Rd 736 2716): Groan! Anyway, since\nthe disappearance of the two male waiters who\nkept groping each other in full view of the\ndiners this has become one of the more\nattractive eating places in Fulham. Interesting\ndecor combined with good value pizzas and\npalatable house wine.\nSHAHEEN TANDOORI (686ish Fulham\nRd): This popular and inexpensive Indian\nrestaurant is a must. The full range of standard\nIndian fare is on offer and an excellent meal\ntogether with a pint of lager can be purchased\nfor well under a fiver. Extra hot ph al sauces are\navailable on request, but for alimentary canal\nreasons are best left alone.\nPETER'S PLACE (766 Fulham Rd 736 4376):\nA reasonably priced Greek restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere and good food. Try the\nMeze (a little bit of everything) at \u00a312.00 for\ntwo.\nSTARLIGHT RESTAURANT (at the end of\nthe Fulham Road): to all intents and purposes,\na workman's cafe but if you ran stomach the\ndecor it offers excellent value for money.\nLA BELLE E POQUE(45 Fulham High\nStreet 736 4372): round the corner in Fulham\nHigh Street you can find one of the better\nvalue Fulham eating places. Most of the menu\nis taken up with burgers, but the steaks are\ngood value as well. Puddings are rather\ndisappointing and the service can be incredibly\nslow. Worth trying if you're not in a hurry.\n\u2022Page7\n\n"

Suppose you are, say, a manufacturer of perspex toilet\nseats and you want to bring your\nproduct to the attention of as\nlarge a body of people as\npossible, using the press as your\nmedium. The best way is to\nproduce a slick advertisement,\nwell designed, with lots of\nphotographs and diagrams, and\nthen to pay the horrendous\nadvertising charges levied by the\nSunday supplements to publish\nit. Unfortunately you can't possibly afford all this. The best\nyou can manage is a roughly\ntyped handout on your com-p any' s headed notepaper. What\nto do? Suddenly the idea comes\nto you.

You replace the\nword continued at the foot of\neach page with the word MORE\nin capitals, and at the end you\nwrite \u2014END\u2014 as if it were a computer program. (Witho'ut\nthis terminating construction,\none assumes that a hapless\nmechanical reader would scour\nthe rest of the letter looking for\nmore text and would eventually\nstart again at the beginning,\ncondemned to sit forever in an\nEND-less loop reading about\nperspex toilet seats.)\nFinally, as your master stroke,\nyou don't send your press release\nto the national press where it will\nbe carefully and promptly filed\nunder WPB; instead you must\nsend it to the student press\nwhere, with luck, a young and\nimpressionable editor, short of\ncopy, will be hugely flattered by\nyour interest, and will give you\nrather more space than reader\ninterest merits.\nI had planned to expand on\nthis subject for another few\ncolumns, but space is getting\nprohibitive, so I 'll continue this\ntopic next week when you can\nexpect\nMORE\nI May 6,19831 I Page5\n\n"

    "content": "EXE C NE WS\nPresident'sU GM Report\nI.l.a uH cry s Report\ni have d ratted a detailed response to the Lauwerys Report on the future of\nresidence at Imperial College. The major reason for the report was the\npressure lor highly efficient management brought about by new UGC regulations concerning the amount of central funds that could be spent as a dispensation to the residence account. The report had two major themes: (I) the need to lower the \"subsidy' ol residence: 12) the appointment of a Residential Services Manager.\nThe College 'subsidy' is substantial (ol the order of \u00a3300.000) and does not\ninclude any estimate ot\" cost ol administration time to maintain the residence,\nlire report recommended that this sum should be tully isolated and transferred to an independant residence account. This would clearly have an\nenormous and unacceptable effect on rent bills over the next few yeas. 1 would\ntherefore like the U GM to adopt my response to these sections of the report:\nRecommendation 4\nWe have no object to the costs that arise to the College by having Student\nResidence being identified. However, this must include some estimate of the\nbenefits thai accrue lo the College by being able, for example, to offer\nincentives 10 all li rst year undergraduates and to some groups of overseas\npostgraduates. It is possible that unless the College is prepared to spend a great deal of administrative time isolating these sums precisely only a very\ngeneral estimate will be able to be compiled. 1 would hope that it is the case\nthat the College charges the residence account a realistic price for services\notter ed and. where appropriate credits the residence account with interest\nreceived on the balance held by the College.\nRecommendation 5\nWe icj cci the suggestion that it is possible for the residence account to bear\nthe lull cost of the removal of the UGC dispensations. There are clear limits\nto the extent to which student rents could rise to meet this. The Union would\nfind it totally unacceptable to allow student rents to rise, in percentage terms,\nmore than the maintenance grant. In addition the pressures of the market\nplace would dictate an upper ceiling with places going unfilled. Therefore\nmoney would have to be found by the sale of the assets of the Students\nResidence Committee (one assumes that if residence are to be self sufficient\nthey \u2022 \u2022 ;\n\" ke given the ownership of the Halls/ Houses) to fund the shortfall,\nthis policy would probably be unacceptable to the College. We therefore feel\nthat this recommendation is completely impractical.\nThe Residential Services Manager described would take over much of the\nresponsibilities of the warden making them merely responsible for\npastoral/welfare issues.My response is thus:\nRecommendation 17\n\"l his is not a recommendation I can comment on in any detail until the\ncounter proposals have emerged from the Hall/ House Wardens. However,\nthe Unions initial reaction is that the case is not proven for an appointment at\nthat level, file argument that he can be funded out of income found from\nreducing Wardens/ Sub Wardens is irrelevant, he should be able to fund\nhimself through increased Conference/Summer Bookings. We do feel that an\nappointment could be made at a lower scale as a manager for the SAC Scheme which has consistently failed to realise its potential.\n1 do feel that there is a need lor a more efficient management of Residences\nas a whole hut it is the level of appointment that is at question. We do not\nneed another desk bound administrator.\n2. .Southside Scheme\nI will report to the U GM the details of the first phase of the development of\nsports facilities in Southside. these will comprise of Sauna/ Changing Room lac ili ties. a Gym, Weights Room and a space created for table tennis.\n3. Residence\nIn an attempt lo ascertain student feeling on the linen service 1 have prepared\nand distributed a questionnaire. I apologise for om mit ting Garden Hall in the\nquestionnaire which was prepared at short notice to enable it to be mailed\nwith residence bills.\n4. Ordinary Residence\nSir Keith Joseph has made a statement concerning this matter and has\nadmitted that LEAs are liable to reconsider claims for compensation from\nstudents who were (in retrospect) classified as Overseas Students. However,\nanyone who does feel they are affected should contact their LEA by July 31.\niiie rei.^ no statement yet concerning fees that were paid at the higher rate\nb v wrongly classified students.

    "content": "C CHI Bombed Out\nWith all the brouhaha over the Greenham\nCommon human chain over Easter, some of\nyou may not have noticed the human chain in\nBeit Quad, protesting about the cruise missiles\nto be sited on the Queens Lawn (see\nFEELSICK). The lady in charge of operations,\nLady Ugly Wasteland, decided, in her position\nas a Peace Artist, to have everyone holding\ngarlands.\nA grid is marked out in the quad, and\neveryone is to stand on one of the vertices of\nthe grid. Whenever three people are standing\n\"equally spaced in a straight line, they are given\na garland to hold. No more than three people\ncan stand in a straight line, nor can three\npeople stand in a straight line if they are not\nequally spaced. At first the entire complement\nof People In Social Services Under Protest\n(eight of them) stood in the formation shown,\nand between them carried seven garlands.\nLater, when the President of IC Union, Steel\nGoolies, came out to talk to them, the nine of\nthem stood in a new formation; what is the\nmaximum number of garlands they need?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by Wednesday, 11:00pm. \u00a35\nfrom Mend-a Bike for a randomly selected\nentry.\nLast week's solutions\nPart the first\nQuite a few people entered this, but I soon\nrealised the error of my ways\u2014people, upon\nseeing' a puzzle like this, sent in vast tracts of\nalgebraic calculations. All I needed was a sensible diagram!\nAssume, without loss of generality, that the\npond is one unit in radius. The man in the\ncentre of the pond, can row at the same\nangular velocity as the man on the outside can I run, at a radius of one quarter. Inside this\nsmaller circle, the man can row at a faster!\nangular velocity than the man on the outside,,\nand can thus reach the position shown (the'\nman in the rowing boat is marked B; the man j on the land is L). From here, by making a dash\nfor it, the man in the boat can reach a point\ndiametrically opposite the man on the land in a distance 3\n/ 4 (and thus in time -;\n4). the man on\nthe land reaching that point distance rt \"away,\nin time T\\U which is greater than ;\n4 .\nOf the seven entries, the randomly chosen\nwinner was N Gorsia of Maths 1 who can\ncollect his \u00a35 cheque from the FELIX Office\nafter 1:30pm on Monday.\nPart the Second\nWell, this is a bit complicated. Take the\nfollowing argument: 'Once the boat person has\nestablished a strategy, it is pointless for the\nman on the land to reverse direction, since the\nboat person can reflect his strategy or carry on\nthe same one, whichever gives him the greater\nadvantage'. Accepted? Well, just accept it for\nthis issue.\nNow consider the boat person's path takes\nhim from a point on the inner circle B, to a point on the land B'( we start on the inner\ncircle since this is the largest radius from which\nwe can be sure that the boat person can be\ndiametrically opposite the land man). The path\ntaken by the boat person is clearly a straight\nline; this is the shortest path between the two\npoints. Produce a tangent from B to the inner\ncircle, which cuts the larger circle into two\npieces, X and Y. To reach any point in Y, the\nboat person clearly has to cut into the inner\ncircle; when he again reaches the edge of this\ninner circle, he will be in the same position as\nbefore, or in a worse position, since the man\non the outside can then turn round and be\ncloser to the boat person. The point of destination of the boat person therefore lies in X. Now we require calculus. Look at the\nfollowing diagram:\nL represents the starting position of the man\non the land.\nP is the tangent from B produced.\nO is the centre of the pond.\nB and B' as before.\nThe man on the land starts running\nanticlockwise. The minimal distance from the\npoint L will reach to B'(A, say) is' given by\nA=L'B' \u2014R. BB'\nwhere R is the ratio of the speeds, and L'B' is\ntaken around the circumference of the circle.\nIf o is the angle B 'OB, then, using the cosine\nrule,\nBB' = J\\ \u2022+ r2 \u2014 2rco so' where r is the radius of the pond, =\n1 (say)\nL'B'= n+0 Let D( the D operator) represent differentiation with respect to a.D( BB') = (r.si noV BB So D(A)=l \u2014(s in0)/( BB')\n=1\u2014s in B>0 for 6 > rr/2\nThus B will obtain the greatest advantage by\ngoing along a tangent to the inner circle. The\nmaximum ratio of speeds can then be found.\nThis solution is slightly simplified, and leaves\nmany problems, some trivial, some more\ndifficult. What is the best solution if the man on\nthe land changes direction? What do you do if\nhe oscillates infinitely?\nAnyway, my thanks to Dr Pretzel for such a great puzzle and congratulations to Ken\nMorison, Chem Eng PG, who was the only\nperson to even come close to the solution.\nCue for a puzzle\nAnd now the moment you've all been waiting\nfor. I'm not sure how valid the first two\nsolutions are, not being too well acquainted\nwith the game of snooker, but I am assured\nthat they are well within the rules.\n1. The highest break possible is 162 and is\nachieved thus: you give away, without having\npotted a single red, 159 points. Your opponent\nthen gives away a foul worth 4 points, but\nmakes it a foul snooker. You then pot any\ncolour as a free ball, then the black, then a normal 147 break (all reds with blacks, all\ncolours). The score is then 159 all, with you on\na155 break. The black is then re spotted, which you pot first shot, to give yourself a break of 162.\n2. The lowest total score with all the balls\ndown is 31 points; this is achieved by putting all\n15 reds down in one shot, and putting the\nwhite down in the same shot, which is a foul\nshot, giving away four points. The colours are\nthen potted, a total of 31 points.\n3. Finally, a break of eight points in which\nthe yellow (worth two points) goes down four\ntimes is; your opponent gives away a foul,\ngiving you a free ball. You pot the yellow (one\npoint), follow it with a colour\u2014the yellow\n(three points), then pot the last red on the\ntable (four points). The colour you then pot\nis\u2014believe it or not\u2014the yellow, followed by\nthe first of the colours to go down, the yellow\n(eight points).\nPort-Passing Pranks\nThe seating arrangement was:\nReisenschein\nAdmiral Z Gunter Schutzem Asst\nHeidensieck Di Van Zoom Asst\nGunter Schutzem Admiral Z Asst\nDi Van Zoom [Heidensieck Asst\nReisenschein passed the port to his left\n(clockwise). Hence, Di Van Zoom purloined\nthe port, and three people hadn't any, viz\nGunter, Heidensieck and the Admiral.\nOf the two people who entered this puzzle,\nR Tan of Chem Eng 2 was selected as the\nwinner, and can collect his \u00a35 from the FELIX\nOffice after Monday 1:30pm.] FELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Impen\nTel 01-589 5111 Ext 1048 or Internal 2881 Editor: Martin\nal College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Unio\nS Taylor; Business Manager: Peter A Rodgers: Advertising\nn Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.

    "content": "Bedford and QEC To Be Sold\nThe main sites at Queen Elizabeth College and Bedford\nCollege are to be sold off as part\nof London University's campaign of cuts and mergers.\nThe committee responsible for\nthe forthcoming merger of QEC,\nKings and Chelsea Colleges has\ndecided that the valuable site in\nHolland Park be sold. In proposals last year to merge QEC and\nImperial College, University\ncontinued from front page\nTower. These contain furnished\nflats suitable for four people,\nand would have been by far the\nmost upmarket residences\nowned by the College.\nAn estimated initial income\nfrom the flats of \u00a3177,000,\nbased on \u00a326 per week rent per\nstudent and a large income from\nvacation letting s, was compared\nwith annual expenditure of a hundred and seventy two thou-sand. The terms of the lease were\nconsidered unacceptable, how-ever, the major sticking point\nbeing the College's liability for\nrepairs. Any structural defects\nwould have been the lessee's responsibility, and as the\ncomplex was built mainly with\nthe notorious high-alumina\ncrowding problem to the proposed communal college laundry.\nSecurity: Although the Hall\nsecurity guards try to provide\ncover for the student residences\nas much as possible, they just\ncannot keep out all undesirables\nbecause of poor arrangements\nfor entering the buildings. So\nwhat does the report re com mend? Cut their numbers in\nhalf! This is lunacy\u2014it invites\nthe possibility of theft, harassment and rape. What is needed\nare manned entrances, with one\nguard on constant patrol.\nVacation Accommodation: If\nthe Lauwerys Report wants to\nfind the solution to the residences' financial problems, it\nneed look no further. That over\n1,000 beds regularly lie vacant in\nthe peak of the summer tourist\nseason in the centre of London is\nalmost criminal. Just one night\nat \u00a310 a bed would cover the\n\u00a36,000 saved by cutting the\nnumber of wardens, who would\nthen be available for the benefit\nof students the rest of the year. It\nis to the INCOME side of the\nresidence account that the report\nshould be looking, rather than\nslashing the expenditure side to\nthe detriment of the residence\nsystem. To be fair the report\nFELIX HH HM spokesmen insisted that the site\nwould be maintained as part of\nLondon University.\nMeanwhile, Bedford College\nis moving out to Egham in\nSurrey where it is joining with\nRoyal Holloway, and the beautiful buildings in Regent's Park\nare to be sold\u2014despite an\nagreement that they should be\nused only for educational\npurposes. Members of the\ncement, the College declined to\ntake the risk of a thirty-five year\nlease.\nThe London School of Economics turned down similar\nproposals several years ago for\nthe same reason; the accommodation block bears a thirteen per\ncent responsibility for structural\nrepairs commissioned by the\nlandlords, and the whole complex is worth some \u00a350m. For a college to insure against structural defects would have needed\nTreasury approval, which was\nrefused LSE and would probably been refused to IC as well.\nMichael Arthur, the Student\nServices Officer, was told that\nthese terms would be refused\nunless he could substantially\nUniversity of London Senate\nwho opposed the merger claim\nthat they were 'led to believe' by\nVice-Chancellor Quirk, the\nmoving force behind the mer-gers, that the Bedford site could\nnot be sold. But agents are now\nnegotiating with the Crown to\nchange the terms of the Bedford\nlease to make it more attractive\nto buyers\u2014who are expected to\ncome either from the United\nStates or the Far East.\nrenegotiate the terms of the\nlease, and as the owners of\nCentre Point do not seem over\neager to let the accommodation,\nthis is considered most unlikely.\nAt the same time, the College\nis still considering a proposal to\nbuy the Fremantle Hotel, which\nhas been used as a head tenancy\nfor nearly a year now and is at\npresent on a three-year lease.\nThis policy of looking for\naccommodation is seen as an\neffort to fulfil the promise to\nhouse all first year undergraduates and overseas postgraduates in College-owned\nproperty\u2014a major selling point\nfor universities eager to attract\noverseas students and their high\nfees.\nAardvark\nNever Hurt\nAnyone\nThe University of London I Union will not be buying an\naardvark, it was formally '\nannounced last week. During\nrecent discussions about mas-'\nco try, it was suggested that UL U should have a mascot, preferably\n'something unusual and cuddly',\nand naturally a stuffed aardvark\nwas the first thing to spring to\nmind. The idea has, however,\nbeen discarded, owing to expense and the difficulty of\nacquiring a stuffed aardvark on\nthe open market. A motion to\nthe UL U General Council,\nmoving that the President be\nmandated to take the proposed\n' aardvark on a monthly two-hour\nwalk, has consequently been\ndropped.\nThe UL U President told\nFELIX that there was still a possibility of the Union sponsoring an aardvark in London\nZoo's 'Adopt an Animal'\nscheme, but that really they had\nother uses for the money.\ndoes recognise that summer\nletting reduces rents by \u00a34 a week and that more should be\ndone towards this, but it does not\ngo far enough. The report\nmainly considers conferences in\nHalls of Residence, but there is\nno reason why all College\naccommodation could not be\nused to bring income from the\ntourist trade or indeed from\nanyone who walked in horn the\nstreet. This requires a hard\nnosed, commercial attitude from\nthe conference or SAC officers\ntowards widely advertising this\ncentral London ac com moda tion, and there is no need for the\nappointment of another bureaucrat to run it. Only in this way\ncan student rents be kept down.\nThere is much more I could\nadd, and much of what I have\nsaid is oversimplified. But this is\na consequence of this channel of\ncommunication. The residence\nsystem could do with better\nrepresentation of the people\nmost concerned: the students,\nwardens and sub wardens. So if\nYOU have any constructive\nideas to put forward, then stand\nup and be counted\u2014at the\nmoment College won't stand up\nand count 'em for you!\nWith Deepest\nSympathy...\nThe Handbook Editor expresses his most heartfelt\ncondolences to those societies which did not send him an\narticle for this year's Handbook.\nArticles arriving after last month's deadline will be\nsent to the Editor of next year's Alternative Prospectus\nor (worse still) The Phoenix, unless those societies\naffected send their prettiest female member to plead\nwith him to accept an article.

All reps, this year's and last,\nare expected to attend as there will be lots to\ndiscuss.\nFinally a reminder that the Rag Fete takes\nplace next Saturday (May 14)\u2014if you have any\nideas for stalls, etc, see myself or John\nFerguson (Physics 2) after all he's supposed to\nbe organising the whole thing.\nSee you this evening.\nFiona\nDramsoc\nDiainsot' are once again going to the\nEdinburgh Fringe (the world's largest drama\nfestival). This time under the pseudonym 'Beit\nTheatre'. We have to change our name as\npeople wouldn't pay to see us if they thought\nwe were a punch of posing students.\nThe three productions we are taking are:\nBetween Time and Timbucks by Kurt\nVonnegut. to be directed by Mick Thackray\nand Colin Cooper. This is a space fantasy TV\nplay with a relatively large cast (10 to 1000s) and a lot of scope for creative costume design\nand technical effects.\nWhat Do You Say When You Say Goodbye\nby Melodie Shan, a small cast play which will\nbe directed by Nick Moran and A Dramatic\nAnthology of the Metaphysical Poets devised\nby David Simmons. This will have a cast of\nabout five and hopefully one lute player.\nAuditions: These will be held on Wednesdav May 11 at 7:30pm. Meet in the Dramsoc\nStoreroom beforehand.\nWe are renting the venue in Edinburgh for\nthe entire four weeks of the fringe, and subletting slots to other groups outside College\n(some of them professional). This means we\nneed people there throughout the four weeks\nto manage the technical side, and run front of\nhouse. We also want people to deal with\npublicity, for instance posters have to be put\nup everyday as they get taken down so\nquickly.\nIf you are at all interested in any of this\nRUSH to the storeroom NOW and sign your\nname up on the list of people thinking of going\nto Edinburgh (this also applies if you want to\nact but can't make it to the auditions).\nPS: We still have two un saleable morning\nslots left, suitable for children's shows. So if\nanyone can come up with a kiddies alternative\nto Breakfast Telly (prefer r ably non-sexist, non-racist, non-militarist, etc) see Colin Cooper\nwithin the next week. A lot of money can be\nmade from this sort of show if it comes off.\n\u00a5 0 Soc\nI risk my safety with this revelation, but I feel\nthat the details of my friend Prof Paul Stark's discovery must be voiced to the scientific\ncommunity\u2014and I use this surreptitious\nmeans to do so, maintaining my anonymity\ninto the bargain.\nSome days ago Paul rang me in the early\nhours of the morning, telling me that he had at\nlast developed a hundred percent efficient\nsynthetic elastic. He urged me to go down to\nCambridge straight away. As soon as I put the\nphone down the dangerous implications of his\ndiscovery dawned on me. I rang back but there\nwas no reply.\nThe sun was rising as I made my way to\nPaul's lab. The door was locked but the\nwindow through the door revealed Paul's fate.\nDebris lay about the room, of both metal and\nflesh. Blood splattered the floor and walls, and\na tiny black ball, looking just like a child's power ball, ricochetted around and around the\nroom, never stopping. Paul was wrong, the\nelastic was more than 100% efficient. The\nthump of the ball on the door grew louder.\nThe army has cordoned off Cambridge and\nMI5 want to 'talk' to me.\nDoctor XI May 6,19831 I Page9\n\n"

    "content": "f Rhyno takes a look at CRITICON, Imperial\nCollege's critical review magazine and creates\ncritical review for critics.\nRampant\nRamblings\nCriticarp\nA most entertaining piece of prose fell into my\nlap the other day, and I felt the opportunity\nwas too good to pass up.\nFirstly let's explain the setting: Imperial\nCollege Palm court Symphonia has just\nperformed (?) three pieces by Tchaikovsky,\nMahler and Walton. Enter our intrepid hero,\nthe immortal music critic Peter Wohlfarth, tar\nMg \u00a3j> \u00abVAtVLE ,Ta*tC^wiL t_i^M AND HIS, KMKV\nV3T \u00abLM\u00a3\nbrush in one hand, a set of aging Teutonic\nprogramme notes in the other. He mounts his\nfaithful but ailing steed, CRITICON, and rides\nforth into...the Concert review.\nIt contains all the gorgeously florid\nphraseology worthy of a \u00a32.99 Classics for\nPleasure record sleeve. Or was that the\nsleeve pleasure classic at a record \u00a32.99. Or\nthe classic pleasure for sleeves, recorded for\n\u00a32.99. I forget. It also becomes apparent during\nthe review that Mr Wohlforth has recently\ntaken a correspondence course in German.\nSpurious phrases such as Das Lied Von der\nErde, Ging herd mo rgen uber s Feld and hum it\nto yourself seem to appear randomly\nthroughout the text.\nThe man's astonishing perception strikes\none immediately. Mahler, we are told, has the\nability to express all the fears and aspirations\nof mankind (no doubt on a plain postcard in a witty and original fashion mentioning Brand X soap powder in not more than fifteen words).\nDoes this imply that Mahler also managed to\nexperience all man's aspirations? (he obviously\ngot around a bit) or perhaps he just liked\nmeeting people.\nThe wordy Wohlfarth ploughs on through\nthe m iry cultural expostulations to bring us\nLife, Death and early Jewishness.\nOnly in the last half of the review are we\ntreated with a little resume of 'how the\norchestra did it', by way of relief from our\ncultural edification.\nJudging by his lack of comment, our\nreviewer clearly hasn't discovered the Penguin\nBook of Tchaikovsky yet, or is perhaps unable\nto cope with a Russian correspondence\ncourse. So, of course, Tchaikovsky, Walton\nand Barry Douglas are condemned out of\nhand, as a sort of also ran footnote. Perhaps\nMr Wohlfarth should have stuck to three blind\nmice.\nWhich leaves one wondering if a man of\nsuch culture, such undiminished arrogance,\nand unquestionable verbose pomposity might\nnot be a suitable candidate for Prime Minister,\nLeader of the EEC, or even ICU President.\nRhyno\nPage81 May 6,1983 FELIX\n\n"
