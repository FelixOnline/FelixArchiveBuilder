    "content": "WELFARE\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019 FELIX\n90\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nWorld AIDS Day\nOn the 1st\nDecember world AIDS day took place, to support people living with HIV, raise support for the fight\nagainst HIV, and remember those dead from AIDS-related illnesses.\nWELFARE\nFreya Hepworth\nLloyd\nLGBT+ Officer\nI\nt is estimated that\nover 100,000 people\nin the UK are living\nwith HIV. An estimated 7,500 of those are\nundiagnosed. The life\nexpectancy for people\ndiagnosed early (15-59)\nis the same as the general\npopulation. However\nnearly half of HIV diagnoses are late.\nHIV is transmitted\nthrough particular body\nfluids.Thisincludesblood,\nsemen, vaginal and rectal\nsecretions, and breast\nmilk. The greatest form of\ntransmission of the virus\nis through unprotected\nsex with a transmission\nrisk of 2-20%. But babies\ncan contract HIV from the\nmother during pregnancy,\nchildbirth and breastfeeding at a rate of 15-45%.\nSharing of needles and\nneedlestick injuries can\ntransfer the virus as well\nas blood transfusions and\norgan transplants from\ninfected donors.\nBlood donations are\ntested rigorously for any\nblood-borne viruses in the\nUK.Despitethis,menwho\nhave sex with men, sex\nworkers and people who\nhave group sex are not\nallowed to donate blood\nwithin 3 months of having\nsex. This policy does not\ntake into account sexual\nbehaviour, for example,\ncondom use, PrEP/PEP\nuse, monogamy or recent\nSTI tests.\nHIV damages immune\ncells making it difficult\nto fight infections. When\na person with HIV has\nextensive damage to\nthe immune system and\nacquires a life-threatening\ninfection this is called\nAIDS.\nHIV and Imperial\nEarlier this year the\nsecond patient in the world\nto achieve HIV remission\nwas at Hammersmith\nHospital. After developing Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma\nthis patient underwent\nchemotherapy and stem\ncell therapy. Unfortunately, this type of treatment\nis too toxic for standard\nHIV therapy. However,\nthis is very promising for\ndeveloping treatments in\nthe future. Dr Ian Gabriel\nsaid, \u201cThe treatment we\nused at Imperial was\ndifferent than that of the\n\u2018Berlin Patient\u2019 since it\nused no radiotherapy and\nhighlights that its effectiveness lies in preventing\ncells from being infected.\nThis exemplifies the need\nto pursue and develop\nnew strategies based on\nabolishing CCR5 expression.\u201d\nThe Imperial College\nTrust has been heavily\ninvolved in HIV research\nand treatment from identifying the abnormalities in\nan HIV infected immune\nsystem to developing an\nHIV vaccine. The development of an HIV vaccine\nhas been ongoing for over\n30 years. At Hammersmith Hospital the most\nrecent HIV vaccine trial,\nAd4HIV, has shown some\npromising preliminary\nresults. The results of this\ntrial should be published\nearly next year.\nThe Imperial College\nTrust has also led the way\nfor progressive and inclusive STI testing with the\nintroduction of specialist\nservices for the trans community at 56 Dean Street.\nThey are a trans-led team\nwho offer medical, social\nand housing support.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat we did\nWe have given out\nover 300 red ribbons\nover the last week. We\nhave raised \u00a3184.19 so\nfar for Terrence Higgins\nTrust. We had a stall in\nBeit Quad on Wednesday\n28th November giving out\nribbons and information\npamphlets about HIV and\nPrEP. The ICSM Welfare\nteam organised a free and\nconfidential STI testing\nevent at the Reynolds that\nevening. It was so popular\nthey\u2019re considering\nanother event soon in the\nfuture!\nImportant things to\nknow about HIV\nSeveral measures can\nreduce the risk of HIV\ntransmission during sex.\nType of sex has different\nlevels of risk of contracting HIV from receptive\nanal sex being the highest\nrisk to receptive oral sex\nbeing the lowest risk.\nFactors that can increase\nthe risk of transmission\ninvolve inflammation of\nmucosal membranes such\nas STIs and the presence\nof blood from menstruation or rough sex causing\nabrasion. Factors that\ndecrease the risk of transmission include the use of\nPEP and PrEP, circumcision and lubrication.\nWhat is PrEP?\nPrEP stands for\npre-exposure prophylaxis.\nTaking it regularly every\nday can prevent someone\nfrom getting HIV (in an\nHIV negative person). It\nis the first HIV prevention\nstrategy that can be used\nby both men and women\nwithout depending on\ntheir partner. Taking PrEP\nevery day has shown to\nreduce someone\u2019s risk\nof contracting HIV by\nover 90%. There are\nalso ongoing studies\nlooking into the interactions between PrEP\nand hormones. At the\nmoment it is unlikely\nthat PrEP interacts with\nhormones. However, most\nstudies into PrEP have\ninvestigated its effects in\nmen who have sex with\nmen and heterosexual\nA student run stall raising money for World AIDS day // Freya Hepworth Lloyd\ncouples. So there is a\npush for studies into the\neffectiveness of PrEP in\nthe trans population and\nduring pregnancy that will\nhopefully improve our\ninsight. It is important to\nknow that PrEP does not\nprotect against other STIs\nso try to use other barrier\nmethods if you want full\nprotection.\nWhat is PEP?\nPEP stands for post-ex-posure prophylaxis.\nSimilar to the morning\nafter pill PEP can be taken\nwithin 72 hours after\nexposure to HIV to stop\nthe infection. It\u2019s meant to\nbe used as a last line resort\nin case of an accident (eg\ncondom breaking) rather\nthan using it routinely\nafter sex or after sharing\nneedles. Once you start\nPEP you have to take it\nonce or twice every day\nfor 28 days. The sooner\nit is started and the closer\nyou stick to the regimen\nthe more effective it is at\npreventing HIV. You\u2019re\neligible for PEP if you\nmight have been exposed\nto HIV during sex, have\nshared needles or have\nbeen sexually assaulted in\nthe last 72 hours.\nPEP can be prescribed\nto you at a sexual health\nclinicorinA&E.However,\nPrEP, in England, is a bit\nmore difficult to attain. It\nis possible to buy PrEP\nonline but it comes to\nbetween \u00a317.50 to \u00a380 per\nmonth. The other option is\nenrolling on the IMPACT\nTrial, which gives PrEP to\nthe participants for free. It\nis only open to high-risk\npopulations:\n- Men who have sex\nwith men or trans women,\nwho have had sex without\ncondoms in the last 3\nmonths, and feel they\u2019re\nlikely to do so in the next\n3 months\n- HIV negative partner\nof an HIV positive person\nwhen the positive partner\ndoes not have an undetectable viral load, and it\nis likely they\u2019ll have sex\nwithout condoms\n- Other people who\nare clinically assessed to\nalso be a high risk of HIV\ninfection\nGet tested!\nMost importantly,\nmake sure to get tested\nregularly! When should\nyou get tested?\nEvery 3-6 months if\nyou\u2019re having sex regularly\nEvery time you have a\nnew sexual partner\nIf you notice any\nchanges to your genitals\neg itchiness, unusual dis-charge, skin changes, pain\nduring sex/when peeing\netc.\nIf you have sex with\nsomeone with an STI\nIf you have symptoms\nmake sure you visit your\nlocal sexual health clinic\nor your GP, but if you\ndon\u2019t you can order a\nhome testing kit. Home\ntesting kits are free to\norder in some postcodes.\nIf your borough doesn\u2019t\nfund home testing kits\nyou can buy an HIV home\ntesting kit for about \u00a323\nor a chlamydia and gonorrhoea screening for \u00a326.\nYou can order kits from\nSH:24 and Fettle, who\nwork alongside the NHS.\nHow can I help?\nBecome a volunteer at\nTerrence Higgins Trust\nhttps://www.tht.org.uk/\ntake-action/volunteer\nRaise money for\nTerrence Higgins Trust\nhttps://www.justgiving.\ncom/fundraising/imperi-alworldaidsday\n\n"

Sure, I could be a\nsnob and say how this is\ndestroying the theatre, but\nI tend to think otherwise.\nYes, some fans attending\nshows have caused some\ntrouble (During YouTuber\nARTS\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019 FELIX\n22\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe illusion of accessible theatre: how far have we\nIn a world where we experience more and more things\nthrough screens, the importance of theatre on personal\ngrowth and development is crucial. But how can it\ncontribute to the lives of young people across the world\nwhen most of us can\u2019t afford tickets?\nARTS\nOzbil Ege Dumenci\nArts Editor\n\u201cRush tickets\nand lotteries\nare great, but\nonly if you\nknow about\nthem, and care\nenough to\nqueue either in\nperson or in a\nvirtual line\u201d\nE\nver since my\nstint as a Felix\narts editor\nbegan, I\u2019ve been\npreaching the importance\nof making theatre more\naccessible. For the most\npart, the baby-boomer\nleaning demographics at\nthe theatre astonish me.\nI strongly believe this\nmedium of arts can be a\nformative part of a young\nperson\u2019s development. It\ncertainly was for me, and I\nwouldn\u2019t have it any other\nway. The thrill of live\ntheatre can be inspiring. A\nbrilliant script brought to\nlife by a talented company\ncan be transformative.\nIn a time where we are\nmore divided than ever,\ntheatre can be where\nwe\u2019re united. However,\nwith ticket prices upwards\nof \u00a3200 (I\u2019m looking at\nyou, Hamilton), how can\nwe expect an average\nfamily to be able to afford\na night out at the theatre?\nHow can a young student,\nbarely able to make ends\nmeet, make the most of\nliving in London, one of\nthe theatre destinations of\nthe world?\nOver the last few\nyears, there have been\nsome clear steps forward\nwhen it comes to drawing\nyounger people to the\naudience, but I\u2019m not\nyet fully convinced that\nenough has been done.\nDiscount Schemes\nA select handful of\nvenues have programmes\nin place which allow\nyoung people to obtain\ntickets for very affordable\nprices. Examples include\nthe Jamie Lloyd Company,\nwho have introduced a\n\u00a315 ticket scheme their\nupcoming productions\nincluding for Cyrano\nde Bergerac, a brand\nnew adaptation of the\nFrench-language classic,\nstarring James McAvoy.\nThe English National\nOpera has a scheme called\nAccess All Arias, and\nthe National Theatre has\none called Entry Pass. In\naddition to the Entry Pass,\nNational Theatre sells any\nremaining tickets for any\nperformance, regardless\nof the original price point,\nfor \u00a315 to those with a\nvalid student ID card 45\nminutes before the curtain\ncall.\nThis is all excellent,\nhowever there is a huge\nflaw in this system. These\nschemes are extremely\npoorly advertised. You\nwould only know of them\nthem if you\u2019ve fallen into\nthe rabbit hole of cheap\nWest End theatre ticket\nhunting. This restricts the\ndemographics hugely as\nthe only people who do\nthis are theatre nerds like\nme. So, yeah, while some\ntheatres do offer some\ndeals for students, not\nNational Theatre, the\ntickets were so in demand\nthat a ballot system was\nput in place. Albeit, most\nof her fans were on the\nolder side and it was\na shame that the play\nwas absolutely horrible.\nStunt-casting is a big issue\nwhen it comes to the \u2018celebrity factor\u2019. Stunt-casting is casting people in a\nshow who wouldn\u2019t be\ncast otherwise either due\nto a lack of skill or not\nbeing fit for the character\nin question. This is very\ncommon, especially when\na production is suffering\nfrom poor sales and need\na boost. Without naming\nany names, this not only\nmakes for an unpleasant\ntheatre experience, but\nalso causes a spike in\nthe ticket prices, milking\nthe fans of a celebrity as\nmuch as possible. It\u2019s just\nkind of sad.\nRush Tickets\nThis is by no means\ncatered specifically\ntowards students, but it\nis one way of being able\nto see shows in premium\nseats for a minimal price\ntag. TodayTix, a mobile\napp, releases \u2018Rush\nTickets\u2019 at 10 am every\nmorning for a range of\nshows for \u00a315- \u00a325, and\nthese are allocated on a\nfirst come first serve basis.\nLikewise, some theatres\nstill keep it old school, releasing Rush Tickets at the\nbox office every morning.\nPopular shows such as\nHamilton and Harry\nPotter and the Cursed\nChild have been doing\nonline weekly lotteries\n(Cursed Child\u2019s is through\nTodayTix, whereas\nHamilton has its own\nlottery app). Rush Tickets\nand lotteries are great, but\nonly if you know about\nthem, and care enough to\nqueue either in person or\nin a virtual line. Therefore, similar to discount\nschemes, they mainly\ntend to be used by those\nwho are already involved\nIt wouldn\u2019t be an understatement to say Hamilton has revolutionised the term\u2018musical music\u2019 // Matthew Murphy\n\u201cHow can a\nyoung student,\nbarely able\nto make ends\nmeet, make\nthe most\nof living in\nLondon?\u201d\nColleen Ballinger\u2019s\nstint in Waitress on\nBroadway, there were\nseveral incidences of\nfilming the show, or\npeople leaving the show\nhalfway through to grab\na good place at the stage\ndoor, which is frankly\ndisgusting), however, it\u2019s\nonly logical that with star\npower comes attendance\nby those who would never\npay up for a theatre ticket\notherwise, including\nyoung people.\nThis sometimes works\nwell.

    "content": "PUZZLES\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019 FELIX\n10\nfsudoku@imperial.ac.uk\nA CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week, Felix sat down with the Deputy President (Education), Ashley Brookes, to catch up about NSS and PRES\nrecommendations, rep training feedback, and his trip to Singapore!\nFelix: Last time, we\nspoke about progress\nwith analysing and\nbringing the results\nof the NSS and the\nPRES to the College\nand the working\ngroups would be set\nup for those. What\u2019s\nthe progress?\nAB: For the NSS, we had\na working group. It was\ninteresting because there\nwas a lot of agreement\namongst some of the\ndifferent departments on\nthe recommendations\nwe provided, and it was\nsomething that they had\nraised as their own issue\nas well - so it was good\nto see that was a synergy\nbetween our recommendations and some of the\naction plans that they had\nbeen thinking of.\nFelix: What types of\nthings were shared?\nAB: Things like exam\nsolutions being more\naccessible and available\nto students, and providing more funding for\nstudent-staff community\ninitiatives were two.\nProviding more precise\nfeedback and guidance\non assessment for major\nprojects, as well - sometimes they are so loosely\ndefined that students don\u2019t\nreally know so what the\nmarking criteria is.\nWe have had one meeting,\nand the next meeting is\nscheduled for Februaryso it\u2019s a case of trying to\ndo do as much as possible\naround the recommendations between now and\nthen. I and the reps have\ncreated a spreadsheet of\nall the recommendations\nacross the different departments so that we can\nactually track from the\nstudent perspective what\nis happening with the recommendations over the\nterm and over the year - I\nthink that\u2019s very valuable.\nI\u2019ve also been liaising\nwith Rachel Witton,\nExecutive Officer in the\nCollege Education Office,\nabout how to do that \u2013\napply a bit more pressure\nto get things done.\nFelix: How is implementation of PRES\nrecommendations\ngoing?\nAB: The PRES working\ngroup has been a bit\nslower on organising the\nfirst meeting. We have\nbeen applying a bit of\npressure from myself\nand the Graduate Student\nUnion to get the first\nmeeting up and running\nbefore Christmas.\nThere has also been a\nslightly different but\nrelated working group\ncreated, looking at postgraduate regulations, and\nwe\u2019ll be meeting at the end\nof this week for the first\ntime. The undergraduate\ncurriculum went through\na complete review of\nregulations before major\nmodifications, and now\nthere is a similar thing\noccuring for postgraduate\nstudy. Historically there\nhas been a bit of a disparity across departments, so\nthey\u2019re trying to bring it\nall together as one set of\ndocuments of policy and\nregulations.\nFelix: So\u2018regulations\u2019\nrefers to policy and\nthe official guidance\non how assessment\nis carried out, and so\non?\nAB: Yes - in particular,\nfor example, we will be\nlooking to ensure parity\nin the experience of postgraduates going through\nthe early stage assessment\nand late stage review.\nFelix: Last time, we\nspoke about quality\nassurance for post-graduates, and how\nregulations exist but\nthey aren\u2019t always\nfollowed or tracked.\nIs that something\nelse you\u2019d be wanting\nto look into with the\nPostgraduate Research Quality Committee?\nAB: That is essentially\nthe idea behind all of\nthis - there is no general\noversight. The fact that it\nwill be centralised - that\nthere will be one set of\nregulations - will make\nit a lot easier to make\nsure that supervisors are\nadhering to policy in a\nmore structured way.\nFelix: Regarding the\nrecent rep training,\nhow did that go?\nAB: I would say we\ncaptured a good 80% of\npeople \u2013 there are always\nsome people not available\non the day. I think having\nsome targeted groups,\nwhere we targeted 20\nstudents at time, generally\nworked quite well. The\ntraining was generally\nvery well received - we did\na survey at the before and\nafter each session and we\ngot really good positive\nfeedback with reps feeling\nmore confident in their\nability to do tasks they\nneed to. The sessions\nhave been delivered by\nmyself Shervin, Abhijay,\nand also by other people\nin the rep team who have\nhelped when necessary\nsuch as Lucy and Gabi\nand Christy - so overall\nI think it\u2019s been a strong\nteam effort.\nFelix: In our last interview,\nyou had some very strong\nwords about how there\nhas been some failure in\nrolling out rep training\nthis year - with it being\nvery late for certain roles.\nBased on the training that\nyou have just done and\nsome of the feedback you\nhad from that, as well as\nthinking about how things\ncan be improved for\nnext year, what are your\nfindings and what are your\nrecommendations for how\nrep training should be\nimproved next year?\nAB: We definitely want to\nbring the CU rep training\nearlier in the year - finding\nthe right time is not\nalways easy but we feel\nthat should be done before\nthe summer, since all the\nCU Presidents are already\nenrolled by that point.\nTraining of the other\nreps has generally been\ngood - it has been in time\nbefore the departmental\nStudent-Staff Committees, which is one of the\ncritical times you want\npeople to be up to speed.\nI don\u2019t think it is possible\nto really bring that any\nearlier because it happens\nas soon as possible after\nAutumn elections.\nFelix: You mentioned\nin your recent Union\nCouncil report a vid-eo, that was made to\nimprove SOLE feedback - what does that\nmean?\nAB: I think SOLE has had\na bit of a bad press from\nstudents and probably\nfrom staff as well. It\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily always\ncapture views or problems\nin the right way, and there\nis work being done in the\ncollege to try and revamp\nthat and renew SOLE in\nthe future. However, in\nthe meantime, we need to\nwork with what we have.\nSo we are going to put out\na video to help students\nfill in the survey, to help\ngive as much constructive\ncriticism as they can - to\ngive specific actionable\npoints to lecturers, for\nexample. That will be\nreleased when SOLE goes\nlive.\nFelix: You recently\nwent on a work trip\nto Singapore. What\nwas that about?\nAB: That was an interesting process to be a part of.\nThere is a joint exchange\nprogram between the\nthe medical school at\nImperial College and a\nmedical school at NTU\nSingapore. Imperial\nCollege was heavily\ninvolved in creating the\ncurriculum and content\nfor that course. It reached\nthe point where they\nneeded to do a periodic\nreview, to assess whether\nit was a partnership and\ncollaboration that was\nworking. So theyn brought\nin several representatives\non the panel from both\nSingapore and Imperial,\nwhich included a student\nrepresentative from each\nuniversity \u2013 and I was the\nImperial one.\nFelix: What did you\nfind?\nAB: Their approach to\nlearning is very interesting - it\u2019s mainly based on\nteam-based learning. They\nread some proprietary\nmaterial before coming\nto the class, and it\u2019s very\nmuch not lecture-based.\nThey have teams of 6\nto 8 people, and they\ndiscuss questions and\nhave to answer as a group,\ncoming to some kind of\nconsensus. Their answers\nare then discussed as a\nclass. They have a content\nexpert as opposed to a\nlecturer, who will then\nfacilitate that and provide\nsome insights in areas of\nambiguity.\nIt\u2019s been very well\nreceived by students and\nI think it\u2019s really helped\nto build that sense of\ncommunity - and helped\nstudents to be slightly\nless competitive all of the\ntime.\nFelix: Do you think\nthat there is an problem of competitiveness among students\nat Imperial, with how\nthey they approach\ntheir learning?\nAB: I think there can be.\nBut the culture around\nthat is slowly changing,\nand with the new curriculum that is being rolled\nout now there is much\nmore active learning. It\u2019s\ncurrently approaching the\nend of the first term of the\nnew curriculum, so I\u2019m\nlooking to speak with a\nnumber of reps - particularly the first year reps - to\ntry and get a feel for how\nthings have been going.\nAshley Brooks, the Deputy President (Education) // ICU\n\n"

    "content": "Halo Reach on PC: A Perfect Port, but a Flawed Game\nEight years after its release on Xbox 360, the iconic game makes its way to PC with a port by 343 Industries. Felix\nGames breaks down the good and the bad, tinged by a sense of childish joy and nostalgia\nGAMES\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nL\net me make one\nthing clear: I\nam absolutely\nbiased. Halo\nReach was a significant\npart of my teenagedom;\nI spent a frankly unhealthy amount of hours\nsprinting around the wide\nlandscapes and vast alien\nstructures of the original\ngame. It defined my social\nlife \u2013 I\u2019d host huge all-night LAN parties with\nmy friends, joined online\nfan groups where I made\nyears-long friends across\ncontinents and oceans.\nWe\u2019d all rush home from\nschool to play every night.\nI don\u2019t say this as a\ndisclaimer, but rather to\nhighlight that this is one\nof those games which\nmeans more to me \u2013 and\nto many others \u2013 than\njust the quality of its mechanics and gameplay. It\u2019s\ncondensed and purified\nnostalgia, splattered\nacross my laptop screen in\nglorious high-resolution\nin an attempt to digitally\nrecreate the feeling of\nchildhood itself. So many\npeople have been excited\nfor so long to see this\ngame re-release in an\naccessible format.\nDoes it live up to the\nhype? Well, yes. And no.\nThe story is as\nengaging as ever \u2013 it\u2019s not\nDostoyevsky, but it does\nprovide a significantly\nmore compelling story\nthan almost any other\ncompetitive-style FPS.\nThis is what set aside\nHalo from the get-go\nin the early 2000s; its\ndedication to constructing\na world, lore, and \u2013 in\nReach at least \u2013 characters that are engaging\nand capture the sense of\nwonder, scale, mystery,\nand often downright\ncreepiness that defines the\nseries. Technical issues do\nmar the campaign experience \u2013 while multiplayer\nhas dedicated servers,\ncampaign is only supported via player-to-player\nconnections, resulting\nin high input lag even\nfor players in the same\ncountry.\nThe game itself plays\nfantastically at standard\nsettings. It\u2019s a marvellous port \u2013 it\u2019s broadly\nunmarred by the issues\nwe associate with the\nword \u2018port\u2019 itself. I\u2019m still\nscarred by my attempts\nto play Dark Souls on\nPC using a mouse and\nkeyboard. Halo Reach\ncontains few of those\nerrors. Animations play\nsmoothly, the gunplay\nfeels fluid and true to the\noriginal, even despite the\nchange to a mouse and\nkeyboard input. Halo\nmultiplayer was always\ndefined by its unique\nfeeling when compared\nto other competitors like\nCall of Duty or Battlefield,\none that valued aspects\nsuch as consistent aiming\nand longer gunfights than\ninstant reactions and snap\nheadshots. They have\nsuccessfully maintained\nthat sensation, and it is a\njoy to experience.\nThe AI, too, has ported\nsuccessfully. Bungie was\nfamous for its AI back\nin the days of Halo: CE;\nthe utilisation of different\ntactics or styles of combat\nby different enemies made\ncombat dynamic and\nfrenetic, with variation\nin gameplay that was\nfundamental to the quality\nof the campaign. And, as\never, where theAI stutters,\nthere is always a Brute\nwith a Gravity Hammer\nto kick things back up a\nnotch.\nHowever, one core\ngameplay issue is the\nheavily magnetised aim\nassist. They\u2019ve included\nsupport for both controller\nand mouse and keyboard,\nwith the key differentiator\nbeing that using a controller bequeaths the player\nsome of the strongest aim\nassist in modern shooters.\nIt can make online games\nfeel rather unfair when\ntrying to enjoy the PC\nexperience many people\nhave been waiting for,\nand I anticipate that the\naim assist will be nerfed\nin future \u2013 or, optimally,\nan option would be\nenabled to search for aim\nassist-disabled games.\nThe graphical\nsmoothness also runs\ninto problems if a player\nunlocks their framerate.\nPlayers have reported\nissues with screen tearing,\nas well as animations\nonly running at a flat\n60fps \u2013 meaning that at\nhigher frames-per-second,\nanimations will skip over\nframes or, in the worst case\nscenario, end up non-line-ar due to \u2018averaging out\u2019\nthe 60fps animation over\nan arbitrary fps set by the\nplayer. There are also very\nfew customisation options\nfor graphics: a failure to\nutilise one of the strongest\nadvantages PC has over\nconsole.\nHowever, naturally,\nwith higher resolution\nand enhanced graphics,\nthe game still looks ten\ntimes better than it did in\n2011 \u2013 and I played that\nversion until my fingers\ndamn-near bled, so I have\nno qualms about diving\ninto a visually improved\nport. The visuals get a\nthumbs-up from me, with\nthe hope that they develop\ncustomisation further\nduring the broader Master\nChief Collection develop-ment.\nSound quality is, unfor-tunately, a let-down. Yes,\nbooting it up and hearing\nthaticonicsoundtrackplay\nthrough my headphones\nhad me literally jumping\nfor joy and, of course,\nsinging along in a broken\nbaritone. However, the\nSFX are, frankly, broken\n\u2013 they sound significantly\nworse than the original\ngame. The sound of guns,\nvehicles, and other effects\nare muffled and lacking in\nimpact, sounding woolly\n\u2013 it can, at the worst\nmoments, feel as if you\nare playing underwater.\nHalo is, I would argue,\none of the few shooters\nin which immersion\nand sound are important\nbeyond the potential\nimpact on competitive-ness, precisely because of\nthe brilliant world-build-ing it employs. I would\nanticipate a future fix for\nthis problem, but for the\nmoment it\u2019s the largest\ndownside the game has.\nOutside of the game\nitself, 343 has completely\nreworked every aspect \u2013\nsadly, for the worse. The\nold progression system,\nin which levels unlocked\ncosmetic items which\nwere then bought with\ncredits earned in-game,\nhas been replaced with a\nsubstantial downgrade.\nNew cosmetic items\nare only unlockable in\nturn as one levels up, a\npredetermined item per\nlevel-up. This is objectively just worse than the\noriginal\u2019s system, and it\nis mind-boggling that 343\ndecided to implement it.\nMenus have also\nsuffered, with a clunky\nUI and unintuitive design.\nAgain, key features have\nbeen removed \u2013 the\noriginal allowed players\nin a lobby to vote between\nseveral map and game\nmode options, whereas\nthis is now randomised.\nWhy?\nAs a final note \u2013 343\ndid make one inspired\ndecision, which was to\nreleasethegameonSteam.\nThe platform provides\ntwo major benefits: ease\nof accessibility and popu-larity, and a decent infrastructure for mod support.\n343 have enabled mod\nsupport on the game \u2013 and\nthis might be pure genius.\nThe highlight of many\nHalo players\u2019 experiences\nwere the custom game\nmodes and Forge map\nvariants \u2013 the creativity\nof players was massively\ncelebrated and enabled.\nNow imagine what we can\ndo with mods!\nWith that said, where\ndoes the verdict fall?\nOverall, it\u2019s a fantastic\nport, but a flawed game.\nEvery aspect kept and\nported from the original\ngame works like a charm,\nwhich is high praise in\nitself \u2013 ports are notorious\nfor, in short, sucking.\nHowever, the places\nwhere 343 decided to\noverride the original\ndesign or implement their\nown features (such as the\nframerate unlocking) are\nalmost universally flawed\nin their implementation or\nfundamental concept.\nISSUE 1737\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n63\nHalo Reach\u2019s campaign and gameplay are as much a joy as in 2011 // 343\n\n"

I am not given a\nvote on Union Councilthe only sabbatical officer\nnot to have one, in fact\n- because my remit is specifically not to advocate\nor represent students, but\nrather to run this paper\nwith unbiased integrity.\nIt's a hard balance to\nstrike - my position gives\nme insights into aspects\nof College and student\nlife, decision-making,\nexperiences, and so on,\nand I feel a duty to share\nthat. However, I have no\ndesire to risk what I hope\nis a commonly held per-spective: that I genuinely\nattempt to be as impartial\nand balanced in my investigations and reporting as\npossible.\nOn the halls rent debate,\nI feel that some will feel\nthat the reporting is not\nbalanced. To an extent,\nthat is the result of a dearth\nof engagement from the\nCollege side. I cannot\nshare the perspective of\nsomeone who will not\nspeak to me. Fortunately,\nprior to now, I have found\neverybody in the Union\nand College to be highly\nforthright in speaking to\nme as a reporter from the\nstudent paper. I did not\nexpect that entering the\nrole, and highly respect\nit. This is the first time\nI am navigating these\nparticular waters: how\nto report fairly when one\nside remains silent, and\nyour information is driven\nby fewer sources.\nIn this Editorial, I want\nto offer a personal opinion\nand some thoughts on how\nthis situation came to be.\nI will say now: I do not\nthink that the proposal\noffered by College initially was reasonable,\nfor a variety of reasons.\nAccording to the information I have, it cannot\npossibly be considered\na genuinely 'break-even'\nmodel. There are a series\nof very tough questions I\nbelieve the College need\nto ask themselves when\nassessing the financial development of their model,\non the monetary end of\nthings, and on the proce-dural. There appear have\nbeen clear and gaping\noversights in the way this\nmodel was constructed.\nThis was not a malicious act - of that I am\nconvinced. People are\ngenerally not bad, either\nas people or at their\njobs. Rarely is a whole\ndivision bad at either or\nboth. Instead, I personally\nsuspect it stems from\nthe eternal disconnect\nbetween those making\nthe decisions and those\naffected by them. It comes\nfrom a failure to have the\nright people in the room\nwhen decisions are being\nmade.\nThe metric by which\nthis model was assessed to\nbe reasonable was not suf-ficient. As I understand it,\na benchmarking exercise\nwas undertaken, in which\nthe proposed rents were\ncompared to other halls\nacross London. They were\nin the same range, and so\nthe College considered\nthe offer reasonable.\nThis is an Excel spreadsheet exercise.\nNo student would\never be mollified by that.\nHad they been in that\nroom, there are so many\npoints they could have\nraised much earlier in the\ndecision-making process\n- points which, inevitably,\nwere immediately raised\nby students the second it\nwas put to them. Qualitative points, about how\ndeeply and irrevocably\nstudent welfare and community at this university\nwould be affected. We do\nnot want a wealth-seg-regated community. We\ndo not want to price the\npoor out of halls, or out\nof attendance at the uni-versity. Neither does the\nCollege, of course - but\nthe difference is that these\nissues are the primary and\nimmediate concern for\nstudents, whereas naturally they are secondary considerations for those who\nare not directly affected.\nIt is immediately apparent\nto the former, while the\nlatter might miss it.\nThere is an argument\nto be made that this is the\npoint at which consultation occurred - I realise\nthat. However, much of\nthe resource and investment into this model has\nbeen wasted (speaking on\nthe assumption that the\nCollege will amend the\nmodel based on ongoing\ndiscussions.) Additionally, the College has\ngarnered ill will with the\nstudent body when it was\njust completely avoidable\nand unnecessary if they\nwere willing to involve\nthe right people in their\ndecisions from the get-go.\nThis isn't the only\nsituation in which this\noccurs. Another example:\nfunds were wasted at\nWhite City when vital\nequipment or labs had\nto be moved after it was\ndiscovered the original\nlocation was too close to\nthe train tracks, rendering\nthe equipment useless\ndue to vibrations. This is\nsomething researchers in\nthat lab would notice long\nbefore those who were\nmaking the decisions -naturally, as it is their area\nof expertise.\nHaving the right people\nin the room from the start\nrequires a lot of work\nin restructuring the way\npower and decision-mak-ing agency are distributed\nand managed. It also\nrequires a lot of trust and\ncollaboration. There's a\nlot of anger and damaged\ntrust between various\ncommunities here already,\nso that will take time to\namend. But we have to\nstart trying to.\nPeople are not bad,\nmoney-hoarding socio-paths. Students are not unrealistic or entitled. This\nangry, dismissive rhetoric\nneeds to be supplanted by\na common identity and a\ngenuine desire to move\nforward and address the\nunderlying systems that\ncurrently are not functioning in a way that actually\nbenefits us.\n2\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019 FELIX\n20\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIt is not Corbyn that we should be blaming\nbut Labour centrists\nThe refusal of some powerful centre-left figures in the party has crippled the electoral position\nof the Labour party, to the detriment of the entire country.\nCOMMENT\nCalum Drysdale\nComment Editor\nI\nt is now a truism to\nsay that the British\nelectorate is shifting its allegiances\nmore than ever before. A\nswathe of Labour strong-holds, stretching from\nNorth Wales across the\nMidlands and the North,\nthe so called red wall, is\nlooking shaky. Seats like\nDon Valley in Yorkshire, a\nformer coal mining area,\nthat has returned Labour\nMPs since the 20\u2019s are\npredicted to fall to the\nTories on 12th December.\nPolling, focus groups,\nand news reports tell the\nsame story. The people\nof these areas do not trust\nCorbyn. They see him as\na member of the left-wing\nLondon elite that cares\nmore for the people of\nVenezuela or the IRA than\nensuring their economic\nprosperity. They dislike\nhis disdain of the armed\nforces and despair at\nthe muddled Labour\npolicy that would likely\noverturn the result of the\nreferendum that they so\ncomprehensively voted\nfor. As a result, sections\nof the electorate that once\nwould rather have died\nthan vote Tory, will think\ntwice before crossing the\nbox next to the red rose.\nMuch of this, however,\nis not Corbyn\u2019s fault. His\npreferred policy platform,\npresent in a diluted form\nin the Labour manifesto is\noneofeasingtheeconomic\nburden of the least well\noff in society by imposing\na much heavier burden on\nthe wealthy. This is an admirable goal and essential\nin a climate of mounting\ninequality. Other elements\nof the manifesto such as\nthe National Education\nService to help workers\nretrain for new careers that\ndidn\u2019t exist in their youth\nor providing high-speed\nbroadband to the entire\nnation are well thought\nout policies to help the\npeople living in \u2018red wall\u2019\nareas. However, these\nare not the policies that\nare cutting through and\nreaching the electorate.\nThey are tertiary issues in\nan election that can only\nbe about one thing.\nCorbyn\u2019s foreign\npolicy quirks could have\nbeen forgiven as long as\nhe stayed firm on the one\nissue that mattered. On\nthis he failed by allowing\nLabour, after months of\ninternal wrangling, to\ndefine itself as a party of\nRemain with numerous\ncaveats.\nThis complicated\nBrexit policy has allowed\nthe Tories to define this\nelection as another run of\nthe 2016 EU referendum\nand the polling suggests\nthat history will repeat\nitself. This is not Corbyn\u2019s\nfault. A long term Eurosceptic, he has voted\nagainst every European\ntreaty and for the EU\nreferendum, breaking the\nLabour whip to do so.\nHe has long regarded the\nEU as a neoliberal project\nthat helps employers\nundermine the ability of\nworkers to bargain with\ntheir employers for better\nconditions. What power,\nhe asks, does a workforce\nhave if they can be easily\nreplaced by immigrants\nfrom Eastern Europe?\nWhen it comes to Brexit,\nCorbyn is far more in\ntune with the voters of the\nnorth than many would\nbelieve. So why has\nLabour chosen to follow\nsuch a muddled policy of\nrenegotiating a deal that\nit would then campaign\nagainst?\nIt has been the centrist,\nmoderate and metropolitan MPs, the darlings of\nthe metropolitan left that\nare responsible for this\nbetrayal of Labour\u2019s base.\nModerate MPs such as Sir\nKeir Starmer and Emily\nThornberry who sit on the\nfront bench with folded\narms and amused smiles\nthat say \u2018we all know he is\nmad but once we lose the\nelection he will be gone\nand it will be business as\nusual\u2019have forgotten what\nthe party known as Labour\nwas established to do.\nThe majority of them\nare London MPs who\nhave nothing but disdain\nfor the people of the\nNorth. Complaints of\nschools being full up and\nno jobs are dismissed\nwith a waggled finger as\nxenophobia by lawyers\nand union officials more\nused to Westminster than\nYorkshire.\nTheir politics are not\nthose of coal miners and\nstrikes. They represent a\nnew generation of facile\nleft-wing thought found\nlargely in students and\npeople working in right-on\nfields such as media or\ncreative industries. They\nbelieve in freedom of\nmovement, hate speech\nand everyone being nice\nto each other which are\nnot issues that poll well in\nthe red wall. These politicians have presumed that\nthe north would always\nvote for Labour and so\nhave become indifferent\nto their concerns and\ndismissive of their needs\nand this is finally being\nrewarded by voters.\nA weak and divided\nLabour has perpetuated\nthe Brexit fiasco for\nthree years and allowed a\nzombie Tory government\nto limp on. Rebel MPs\nshould back their leader\nand put their case to the\npeople as strongly as they\ncan or leave the party and\njoin another party or set up\non own. The smug rebels\nneed a reality check.\nThe Labour Red Wall are seats that are threatened by a Tory swing // Felix\nThe Red Wall\nThe so-called \u2018Red\nWall\u2019includes many of the\nold Labour strongholds\nlike Great Gimsby, Workington, that is famously\nbeing challenged by the\nTories, and Don Valley.\nMany of these seats have\nnon-local MPs who have\nbeen given a safe seat as\na reward. Don Valley in\nYorkshire, for example,\nis the seat of former Blair\ncabinet member Caroline\nFlint who grew up in\nLondon. Many of these\nseats voted heavily to\nleave the European Union\nand it is predicted that a\nswing of 9% to the Tories\nwould be sufficient to\ndeliver a working majority\nof at least 28 to Boris\nJohnson. At the moment\nthe polls suggest that this\nwill occur, kicking Labour\nveteran Dennis Skinner\nout of his seat.\n\n"

I then returned to Jordan to complete my IB\nDiploma and then came to Cardiff University on a scholarship for my Undergrad.\nIn my final year at Cardiff, I was elected as Vice President Welfare and Campaigns\nso spent another year in Cardiff to represent and advocate for over 32,000 students.\nI\u2019m now at Imperial to complete my Master\u2019s in Sustainable energy Futures and\nrepresent all international students at Imperial College \u2013 over half the student body.\nThis year I want to: expand the introduction of the post-study work visa to include\nthose of us graduating in the year 2020 and beyond; fight for the rights of EU\nstudents post Brexit; create a more connected international community and promote\nmore cross-cultural events; increase support for international students and hold the\nCollege to account e.g. more transparency in tuition fees.\nAs Interfaith Officer, I\u2019m passionate about creating an environment at Imperial\nin which people of faith feel welcome. With over 125 countries represented at the\nCollege, it is difficult to conceive the number of faiths practised by students and even\nmore difficult to imagine Imperial without these differences. Our various STEM disciplines constantly require us to learn from each other to facilitate effective discourse\nand, yet, this principle is rarely applied to other aspects of our lives. I\u2019m sure that if\nwe spent just as long trying to see things from other people\u2019s points of view in our\nspiritual lives we\u2019d all be much better off! I hope to spend the coming year serving\nas both a representative of your individual faith needs and as a bridge linking faith\ngroups to each other. Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out via email or in person if you\nsee me on campus and sign up to the InterfWaith Network on the Union!\nThe idea behind my campaign was a simple one. With hard work & passion,\na group of people can bring positive change. I have been working along a team\nof very enthusiastic & supportive people and have mainly focused on improving\nmental health awareness for this term. My immediate plans for 2020 are: to increase\nthe involvement of Clubs & Societies in mental health related activities; indoor &\nOutdoor activities targeting mental health awareness; get necessary information\n(like well-being advisor\u2019s details, counselling details, etc.) on the Imperial College\nApp; start a social media page to set up communication & increase transparency.\nDemocracy is insane, and sometimes ideas end up being just a .doc, but I promise\nthat slowly & steadily, I will deliver on everything I promised, and to quote the very\nfamous musical, \u201cThere\u2019s a million things I haven\u2019t done, but just you wait\u201d.\nHi everyone! My name is Francesca Siracusa and I am your Ethics & Environment\nOfficer, as well as a year 5 medical student. I represent the student body on environmental and sustainability matters here at Imperial. I work closely with CSPs such\nas the Environmental Society and Divest Imperial as well as staff-led groups like\nGreening Imperial and Imperial Against Climate Change. My main aims this year\nare to: improve communication between the students/staff and the College on environment and sustainability matters; increase student engagement in environmental\nissues through events and campaigns - e.g. Climate Assembly, Greening Imperial\nWeek; work with Campus Services and the Union to improve sustainability of food\noutlets and reduce waste; represent the student body in the College\u2019s new Socially\nResponsible Investment Policy working group\u2026 and more!

The\nLeave campaign was\nbased on lies and anti-mi-grant rhetoric, and the\nRemain campaign was\nbased on fearmongering\nand an overcrowding of\nuntrusted establishment\npoliticians. Remaining\nin the EU, as backed\nby Cameron\u2019s govern-ment, was rejected by an\ninfamously slim margin\nof 52-48, as a rejection\nof the establishment and\na demand for change.\nCameron, embarrassed,\nwas forced to step down\nafter 6 years as Prime\nMinister, triggering a\nConservative leadership\ncontest which was ultimately won by Theresa\nMay \u2013 a Remain-voter\npromising to get Brexit done. Meanwhile, a\nsecond Labour leadership\ncontest was triggered by\nrebels in the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP),\na contest that was won by\nan increased landslide by\nCorbyn.\nParliament triggered\nArticle 50 on 29 March\n2017, starting the two\nyear withdrawal process.\nRealising that the\nCameron majority may\nnot be enough to get a\ncontroversial Brexit deal\nthrough Parliament, and\nwith Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour polling disastrously\ncompared to her party,\nMay called an early General Election, hoping to\ncrush the opposition and\ngain a great majority.\nDespite the pundits expecting Labour to receive\ntheir worst ever election\nresults for almost a centu-ry, Corbyn and his party\ncampaigned on a progressive manifesto promising\nthe abolition of tuition\nfees and putting public\nownership back onto the\nagenda. May\u2019s popularity fell, along with the\nTories\u2019 manifesto launch\noffering next to nothing\nfor the ordinary working\nfamily. Young voters were\ninspired by Corbyn and\nhis policies to come out\nin record numbers, and\nwhen the Exit Poll came\nout at 10pm on 8th June,\nit shocked the nation.\nCorbyn had won many\nseats and forced a hung\nParliament, with the\nelectorate firmly rejecting May\u2019s call. Forced\nto enter into a confi-dence-and-supply deal\nwith the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the\nTories went into minority\ngovernment.\nWith a widely unpopular Brexit deal\nnegotiated by 2019, it was\ntime to take the deal to\nParliament for approval.\nParliament, with Corbyn\nas Leader of the Opposition, rejected it multiple\ntimes in historic defeats\non a scale never before\nseen for a governing\nparty, and delayed Brexit\nto October 31st to avoid\na no deal exit. Unable\nto deliver Brexit, May\nstepped down in June\nand triggered another\nConservative leadership\ncontest, this time won by\nBoris Johnson, former\nMayor of London and\nformer Foreign Minister,\npromising to get Brexit\ndone by October 31st no\nmatter the cost \u2013 even\nwith no deal in place.\nWith a new Brexit\ndeal negotiated by Prime\nMinister Johnson, labelled as \u2018May\u2019s deal but\neven worse\u2019, he failed to\nget it through Parliament\nand Parliament forced\nJohnson to delay Brexit\neven further in order to\navoid no deal, with a new\nleaving date of January\n31st \u2013 meaning that Johnson failed to deliver his\nflagship promise.\nWith the Labour Party\nagitating for an early\nGeneral Election to save\nour public services and\ndeal with Brexit once and\nfor all, and with no way\nforward for his deal in\nthis Parliament, Johnson\ndecided to back an early\nelection: for December\n12th, 2019 \u2013 this Thursday.\nWith both Labour and\nthe Tories hopeful to win\na majority, with Nigel\nFarage\u2019s new Brexit Party\nin the mix, and with the\nLiberal Democrats moving to a \u2018Cancel Brexit\u2019\nposition, it is unclear how\nthis election will play out.\nFor many, tactical voting\nfor a Second Referendum\nor Leave majority will\ndictate how they vote.\nFor others, the National\nHealth Service and the\nthreat posed to it by US\ntrade deals is their main\nconcern. Can Jeremy Corbyn end 9.5 years of Tory\nausterity with a Labour\nmajority government\ntransforming the UK and\ngiving voters the final say\non Brexit? Will Johnson\nsecure a Tory majority\nand get his withdrawal\nagreement through Parliament? Or will we enter\nanother hung parliament,\nwith the SNP or the Lib\nDems as the kingmakers?\nAll shall be revealed in\n4 days time \u2013 and it all\ndepends on how we vote.\nMake sure you go to the\npolls this Thursday and\nhave your say in the most\nimportant election since\n1979.\nEU Referendum 2016\nGeneral Election 2019\nGeneral Election 2017\nTheresa May 2017 // Wikimedia\nBrexit // Pixabay\nBoris Johnson // Flickr\n17\n\n"

But its impact on the gaming industry cannot\nbe understated. Firstly, it has popularised the Battle Royale genre leagues beyond what\nPUBG ever did. Secondly, it (similarly to Minecraft) encapsulated an entire generation\nto such an extent that simply uttering the word\u201cFortnite\u201dwill have 10 year olds flocking\naround you like an army of angry seagulls. It was influential not just for having millions\nof concurrent players, but also for the way it changed game monetisation. It popularised\nthe use of a\u2018Battle-pass\u2019system, where the game is free, but to get all the cosmetics you\nneed to pay for a seasonal battle pass that can be levelled up, and as you level it up you\ngain rewards. This gives a sense of progression present in normal games, whilst also continually raking in cash. This is not a great thing for anyone but its influence on the industry is very noticeable, with games like Call of Duty, Destiny 2 and Apex Legends all using\na very similar monetisation technique.\nHonourable mentions: EA\u2019s Star Wars Battlefront, Candy Crush Saga, GTA V, and services\nsuch as Humble Bundle or the Xbox Game Pass have all \u2013 for better or for worse \u2013 drastically impacted discussions around and methods of monetising games in the last decade.\nVideo Games as a Storytelling Medium: Portal 2\nHow could a game be better than one of my favourite games of the 2000s? Well, being\nthe sequel to one of my favourite games of the 2000s is a good start! Portal 2 exceeds in\nall ways, not only as a puzzle game, or a platformer game, but also as a narrative mas-terpiece. A key element of Portal 2\u2019s narrative success is in its premise. With the help of\nWheatly, one of the funniest characters in gaming, you try to navigate yourself out of the\nclutches of GLaDOS and out of Apeture laboratories. It is one of the most sharply written\ngames ever, which is not commonplace for puzzle platformers. It was so influential that\nthere are many, many games which take clear inspiration from Portal 2, so much so that\nit could now even be seen as its own genre. Games such as The Talos Principle and The\nTuring Test would not exist if it weren\u2019t for Portal, and I think that that is truly amazing.\nEven putting all of this aside the gameplay is so unique and addictive that I completed\nthe whole thing in one day, then again, the next day in multiplayer with my brother!\nUnlike many other games, Portal 2 is such a unique gem in its genre that you really can\u2019t\nplay anything else like it.\nHonourable mentions: too many to count. Video game narratives and themes have so\nwildly changed in scope, and prioritisation, in the last decade that it is impossible to\nisolate just a few examples of exemplary writing. Personal favourites include The Talos\nPrinciple, The Turing Test, The Last of Us, and Spec Ops: The Line.\nDefining Esports, Video Games\u2019\u2018Secondary Industry\u2019: League of Legends\nIt is hard to understate how massive League of Legends is and has been for the past\ndecade, with player numbers and hours played maintaining industry-leading heights\nfor longer than most games are even remembered. It single-handedly turned the MOBA\ngenre into one of the most popular worldwide, and managed to appeal to players from\nevery continent in a way that most prior games had abjectly failed to do. It\u2019s biggest\nimpact, however, has been in driving the explosion of esports as an industry \u2013 one that\nhas begun to emulate traditional sports leagues, with regulations, thousands of employ-ees, high paychecks, franchising, and companies fighting for broadcast rights. None of\nit would have been possible without the fever-pitch of excitement that organically grew\naround League in its early years. League did not birth a genre, it birthed an industry.\nHonourable mentions: Overwatch and DotA 2 also significantly contributed to the\ncurrent shape of the esports market, in popularising a franchising system and venture\ncapitalism investment, and in driving up prize pools respectively.\n// Valve\n// Epic Games\n// Riot Games\n\n"

Swinson has since\npublicly denied that she\nenjoys killing woodland\ncreatures for fun. A more\nrecent fake story emerged\nin the form of tweets by\na \u2018Max Gapes\u2019 which\nclaimed that Swinson\nwas considering resigning before the election,\nand that senior Lib Deb\nfigures had already\nattempted to discuss a\ncoalition agreement with\nthe Conservatives. These\ntweets, painting a picture\nof a party in total disarray,\nwere shared by senior\nLabour Party figures, but\nthen promptly debunked.\nFor a party victimised\nby, and so strongly\nopposed to, fake news,\nthe Lib Dems have come\nunder heavy criticism for\ncirculating fake information of their own. The\nwidely derided \u2018Lib Dem\nbar charts\u2019, a recurring\ntactic of misrepresenting\npolling or historic election\ndata to exaggerate their\nown electoral chances,\nhave been out in full force\nthis cycle. The party\u2019s\nhead of media was also\nsuspended over allegations that she fabricated\nan email in attempts to\ndiscredit a negative\nnews story. Many voters\nflocked to the Lib Dems\nafter being frustrated and\ndisaffected by the Leave\ncampaign\u2019s deployment\nof misinformation, so the\nparty\u2019s own failings in this\narea will have contributed\nto pushing away these\nvoters.\nThe Liberal Democrats\u2019\nfailure to retain a loyal\nbase of Remain voters\ncan also be explained,\ncounterintuitively, by\ntheir extreme Brexit\npolicy of revoking Article\n50 (i.e. cancelling Brexit\nwithout any additional\nreferendum). Jo Swinson\nhas struggled to justify\nthis policy on multiple\nTV debates, with many\nRemain voters criticising\nthis policy as too extreme,\nundemocratic, and too\nalienating of Leave voters\nto have any chance of\nsuccess. It does not help\nthat the party\u2019s main\ndefence of this policy\nhas been that they would\nonly enact it if they won\na majority (implicit in this\nstatement \u2013 that it is rather\nunlikely). So why even\nbother voting for them?\nThe party which long\nchampioned the \u2018People\u2019s\nVote\u2019 seems to have shot\nitself in the foot by abandoning it.\nWith polling day\nimminent, only time will\ntell whether the Lib Dems\nwill be able to recapture\nsome of the support they\nformerly enjoyed. The\nparty hopes to be the\nkingmakers of a hung par-liament, but to reach this\nposition they will need\nmore than the humble\n13 seats predicted by the\nYouGov MRP model.\nAnd if they do, will they\nbreak their promise not\nto put Jeremy Corbyn\nin Number 10? Or will\nthey once again back the\nConservatives (perhaps in\nexchange for a referendum\non Boris\u2019 Hard Brexit)?\nAnd will Jo Swinson be\nable to hang onto her\nEast Dunbartonshire\nseat, which the SNP are\nstriving to retake? Only\none thing is certain \u2013 the\nonce expected Lib Dem\n\u2018surge\u2019 has emerged as\nlittle more than a trickle.\n15\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n80\nT\nhere might be a big question mark as to why the Divergent trilogy is on this list, but I feel its impact, be it on the young adult literary\nscene or on my personal love for reading, has earned it a spot on here. It\u2019s been almost a decade since I first laid eyes on the first\ninstalment of the series; I can\u2019t quite comment on its literary values the same way I once did but as a teenager I thoroughly enjoyed\nit. The story is set in post-apocalyptic Chicago where citizens are pre-defined and sorted into one of the five factions as the society\nsees fit, with the protagonist Beatrice \u201cTris\u201d attempting to make a sense of her \u201cdivergence.\u201d The series, along with Suzanne Collins\u2019s Hunger\nGames Trilogy and James Dashner\u2019s The Maze Runner Series, are unquestionably quintessential of this genre. The themes of self-discovery,\ntransition into adolescence, and choices and consequences echo throughout and are what primarily appeal to the teenage audience. This series\nhas garnered commercial success (6.7 million copies were sold, and $700 million in box office) and to a certain extent prompts the return of\ndystopian fiction (resurgence of classic dystopias like George Orwell\u2019s 1984 and Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World). This genre continues to\ndominate the YA shelves and is definitely characteristic of this decade, and The Divergent Trilogy is certainly the most representative work of\nthe genre. -Jia Qi Tan\nEditors\u2019 Top Picks of the Decade\nMight be an odd mix of titles, but Felix Books Editors present to you their top picks of the decade\nWhen Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi\nBOOKS\nAnushka Kulkarni\nBooks Editor\n& Jia Qi Tan\nBooks Editor\nThe Divergent Trilogy by Veronica Roth\nW\nhile looking for books to read this summer, I came across one called \u2018Things my son should know about the world\u2019 by Frederik\nBackman, and immediately fell in love with the writing. I started to follow the author, and read more of his books. So when I was\nasked to list my favourite books of the decade, I knew I had to write about Frederik Backman\u2019s books. Each of his books develop\nthe characters so well, that it is as if you are present there right next to them as you learn about their life. I read four of Backman\u2019s\nbooks over the summer, but I will only write about two of them: one that left me smiling long after I had finished it (the one mentioned above),\nand one that actually made me cry. The latter one is called \u2018And every morning the way home gets longer and longer\u2019, and despite being a rather\nshort book, it leaves you with more emotions than the longest of novels.\nIn this book, Backman addresses his one or two year old son as he shares and reflects on the experiences in his own life, right from his\nchildhood to his present life. Each chapter is like a new letter to his son, discussing a different aspect of life. Since it is a father talking to a\nchild, the writing style is rather candid, and instantly engaging. The most charming aspect of this book, however, is the fact that though the\nwriter is sharing his life with his son, there is a certain fairy tale quality to each experience that makes it hard to decide whether it is fiction or\nnon-fiction. I say charming because since it is real, it is highly relatable, and since it is dream-like, it is not boring at all! As a young female\nuniversity student I can guarantee that even if you are not a father who is writing this book, or a son who is meant to read it, it is an enjoyable\njourney, and definitely worth a read. -Anushka Kulkarni\nThings My Son Needs To Know About This World by Frederick Backman\nAnd Every Morning The Way Home Gets Longer and Longer by Frederick Backman\nI\nam sure that this short novel will remain one of my favourite ones because it is the most creative one that I have read. And it is one of the\nvery few ones that have made me cry. It is the story of an old man desperately trying to hold on to his memories as they fade away faster\nevery day. And it is the story of a young boy helplessly watching his grandfather forget a little more of himself every day. Backman takes\nus (and the young boy) inside the grandfather\u2019s mind (a square), and we observe the square getting smaller and smaller each day, which\nthe old man can feel, but cannot control. This rather heart-breaking journey takes us through the different, random memories that are still left\ninside that square \u2013 both happy and sad, and full of love. It is one of those novels that is so full of emotions that we find ourselves unable to\ncontain our own as we reach the end. In our very busy, very work-centred lives, this novel is great to get in touch with our emotions, especially\nones that we forget we can feel. -Anushka Kulkarni\nP\noetic, poignant, and profound, Paul Kalanithi\u2019s memoir as a neurosurgeon diagnosed with Stage IV\nmetastatic lung cancer is unbelievably powerful in Kalanithi\u2019s quest to answer the difficult question of\nwhat makes a life worth living. It\u2019s a strange perspective on human identity and mortality when your role\nconstantly switches between being a doctor treating the dying and a terminally ill patient - is death still so\nchilling and unsettling? What matters and what doesn\u2019t? It encompasses many themes from religion to philosophy\nto medicine but it maintains some sort of coherence. Kalanithi has expressed his love for reading and writing - he\nmajored in English Literature - and it definitely shows in the book. It\u2019s lyrical, precise, philosophical, and hits\nso close to the heart. At first glance it may seem like a rather straightforward read, but once you dive in, there\u2019s\nso much packed in his words. It\u2019s something that I constantly go back to, where I can get something out of it in\nevery reread, and I can say that it\u2019s the book that hit me the hardest in the past decade. Let me leave you with an\nexcerpt from the book, \u201cYou can\u2019t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you\nare ceaselessly striving.\u201d -Jia Qi Tan\n\n"

    "content": "Amnioverse: a perfect album listening experience\nI\ndon\u2019t think I\u2019d be\noffending anyone\nby saying that most\nlisteners of electronic music focus more\non singles than albums.\nWhen you listen to\nHybrid Minds or Bicep\nyou normally wouldn\u2019t\nplay the whole album\nstart to finish. However,\nthere are electronic\nalbums that actively\nwork against this listening style.\nAmnioverse is an\nalbum that rewards\npatient listeners. I\u2019ve\ngone through Amnioverse probably over\n20 times now and am\nstill enjoying the progression of motifs and\nsonic themes. Lapalux\n(aka Stuart Howard)\ncreated this project\ninspired by ideas of the\namniotic sac, creation\nand the universe. Pretty\ngrandiose ideas, but he\u2019s\nnot claiming he has the\nanswers. Stuart\u2019s goal\nwas to create an album\nwhere the evolution of\nthese ideas was explored\nin a consistent flowing\nnarrative. \u201cFor me the\nreal focus was that the\nwhole record flowed,\u201d\nhe says. \u201dI worked on\neach song sequentially\nand wouldn\u2019t stop\nworking on a session\nuntil they fitted together\nand told the story that I\nwanted to tell.\u201d\nThe first track\n\u201cOblivion\u201d opens as\nan introduction into\nthe world the album\ninhabits. The sounds\nused here persist and\nadapt throughout. Thematically, this opener\nis the primordial ooze\nfrom which the album\ngrows. Shifting into\nthe next track, \u201cVoltaic\nAcid\u201d, the drums are\nintroduced. The beat\nis volatile, unstable.\nOn a first listen almost\neverything seems to\nhappen at random, but\nthe more you hear it the\nmore you find patterns\nand repeated dynamics.\nAn erratic set of drum\nfills will culminate in a\nclear hit as the beat ebbs\nand flows.\nFrom track to track,\nmotifs are repeated but\nare always developed.\nAn element from a\nprevious track will return\nin a more contained and\nprecise way. \u201cEarth\u201d or\n\u201cThe Lux Quadrant\u201d\nare perfect examples.\nThe few tracks prior to\nboth are wonkier, less\npredictable and could\nbe (depending on your\ntaste) not as enjoyable.\nBut the introduction of\nnew sounds or the maturation of old ones makes\nfor a more harmonious\nlistening experience.\nIn particular, \u201cEarth\u201d\nbecomes the perfect\nmicrocosm of the tracks\nprior, it\u2019s the most\nsingle-like track on the\nwhole album as it\u2019s just\nso darn lovely.\nAs though the spectacular narrative, growth\nand flow wasn\u2019t enough,\nall the other elements\nof the album excel. The\nproduction is so clean,\nnothing sounds messy\nor unintended. Despite\nbeing few in number,\nthe voice samples used\nare impactful and never\nappear unless something is gained. There\nare well choregraphed\npeaks and troughs in the\nenergy of the album, it\nnever becomes boring.\nHonestly I find it hard to\nfault this album.\nAmnioverse is the\ncurrent peak of Stuart\u2019s\ndiscography, and it\nseems like a pretty\nfitting way to finish off\nthe first decade of his\nmusic career.\nAfter a decade of Lapalux\u2019s music we get an album\nabout creation... ironic, no? // Bandcamp\nMUSIC\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019 FELIX\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n58\nMUSIC\nGuthrie Ruby\nMusic Editor\nArtist: Lapalux.

FKA Twigs\nunleashed her incredible\nvocals at emotional\nclimaxes of songs, and\nwhat a voice it is. Whether\nwhispering or reaching\nangelic high-notes,\nTahliah Barnett\u2019s voice is\na force of nature, leaving\nconcertgoers at Brixton\nAcademy in no doubt of\nher vocal prowess, or the\npassion behind the voice.\nA vocal highlight came\nwhich was a vulnerable\nperformance of \u2018Mirrored\nHeart\u2019, where twigs\u2019voice\ntrembled with emotional,\neven stifling, sobs before\nthe final line \u201cThey just\nremind me I\u2019m without\nyou\u201d.\nAn impressive element\nof the performance was\nthat each song had been\ntweaked, with drums and\npercussion amplified as\nwell as extended instrumental sections allowing\nfor choreographed dances.\nRather than relying on a\nbacking track each instrumental was created by a\ntrio of musicians, playing\ncello, electric drums\nand a variety of other\ninstruments. The trio\nresourcefully reconstructed each track with the\nresources they had, giving\nthe audience a somewhat\nfresh interpretation of\neach track. Enough praise\ncannot be given for this\napproach, a laudable\neffort from a primarily\nelectronic artist to keep\ntheir live performances\norganic and human.\nAnyone familiar with\nFKA twigs will be aware\nshe came into the world\nof music as a dancer.

    "content": "come and how far do we have left to go?\nin the theatre community,\nat least more so than those\nwho have never stepped\ninto a theatre before.\nContent and Context\nI suppose it\u2019s common\nsense that if the content\nof a show caters towards\na young audience, they\u2019d\nbe more likely to see it.\nWord of mouth alone\nshould be enough to draw\nsome young people to\nthe theatre. Some recent\nexamples to what I\nconsider to be \u2018approachable content\u2019 include\nHamilton, Six and Dear\nEvan Hansen. The former\ntwo, although focusing\non historic events way\nbefore our time, have\nfound a way to make\nthemselves extremely\nrelevant. Hamilton is a\n\u2018rap musical\u2019 about one of\nthe founding fathers of the\nUnited States, and Six is\na raging girl band concert\nabout Henry VIII\u2019s wives.\nDear Evan Hansen, on\nthe other hand, is written\nabout young people, for\nyoung people, touching\non important issues that\nof audiences that are noticeably younger. I\u2019ve met\nmany teenagers and young\nadults while watching\nDear Evan Hansen and\nHamilton, some of whom\nhad travelled to the UK\nfrom across Europe.\nHowever, it must be\nnoted here that all this\nmeans nothing, when\ntickets for these shows,\nnamely Hamilton, cost an\narm and a leg. Upwards\nof 200 pounds in some\ninstances. Charging\nalmost-unprecedented\n(and thus most likely\nunwarranted) amounts for\nsuch shows is greedy, and\ndefeats its own purpose.\nPodcasts\nThis is an odd one. A\nfew years back, a group of\nvery creative individuals\ncame up with the idea of a\n\u2018musical podcast\u2019, with an\noriginal story and original\ncompositions, free for all\nto enjoy on all the usual\npodcast platforms. Their\nfirst challenge was to\nwrite a musical that the\nlisteners would be satisfied with simply listening,\nand would not leave\nfeeling like they need to\nsee it staged on a show.\nThe result was a three-act\nmusical called 36 Questions, starring Jonathan\nGroff (Hamilton, Glee,\nMindhunter) and Jessie\nShelton (Hadestown,\nWaitress), both of whom\nare respected, well-known\nBroadway actors. And\nboy, does it work.\nI discovered this\nproject only a couple of\nmonths ago. However, a\nquick google search leads\nto a plethora of articles\npublished around the time\nof its release that calling\nthe project \u2018the future of\nmusical theatre\u2019. I\u2019m not\nsure that I would go that\nfar.\nThis specific project\nis excellent, and does\nprovide a way for anyone\nwith an internet connection to be able to enjoy\na musical free of charge.\nEveryone involved do\na wonderful job and the\nfinal product is entertaining and original, however,\nI am not quite sure if it\nthe one existing follow-up\nproject (from a completely\ndifferent team), Anthem:\nHomunculus, starring an\nendless number of iconic\nBroadway stars including,\nCynthia Erivo and Glenn\nClose, has exclusively\nbeen made available on\na paid podcast platform.\nI don\u2019t know how much\nthis platform costs, and\nI\u2019m not sure I really care.\nIt just makes me feel sad,\nknowing that a group of\npeople have taken this\nselfless idea that originated with 36 Questions\n(their only revenue would\nbe from the small ads that\nplay before each episode),\nand charge people for it.\nOnce again, the theatre\ncommunity found another\nway to defeat its own\npurpose.\nJust a small note here:\nbetween starting to write\nand finishing this article,\na two minute trailer for\na new project called\nChildish: The Podcast\nMusical has made its way\nonto the internet. A quick\ngoogle search shows that\nthis project was brought\nto life as a result of a\ncampaign that raised\naround \u00a31700. From\nwhat I gather, this will\nbe more along the lines\nof 36 Questions in terms\nof broad availability. So\nmaybe all is not lost for\nmusical podcasts after all.\nOnly time will tell.\nIn conclusion, I\nhonestly do think that\nover the years we\u2019ve\nmade great progress when\nit comes to audience di-versification. Solid efforts\nhave been made, be it\nthrough discount schemes\nor bringing theatre to you\nin the form of podcasts.\nHowever, there\u2019s still a\nlong way to go, especially\nsince greed seems to be\nplaying a role in gatekeep-ing the barrier between\nthe theatre and the youth.\nA triumphant podcast-musical about what truth really means // Two Up Productions\nISSUE 1737\nFELIX\n23\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201capproachable\ncontent means\nnothing when\ntickets cost an\narm and a leg...\nupwards of\ntwo hundred\npounds\u201d\n\u201ca\u2018musical\npodcast\u2019, with\nan original\nstory and\noriginal\ncompositions,\nfree for all to\nenjoy\u201d\ntoday\u2019s young people\ncan relate to, such as depression and suicide and\nsocial media.\nIt is my genuine wish\nfor productions like these\nto keep appearing on the\nWest End, as every time\nI visit the theatre for such\na production, it makes me\nhappy to see that they do,\nin fact, tend to be made up\ncan replace the physical\nexperience of sitting in the\naudience.\nThe initial idea of\nproviding free, original\nmusical content to anyone\nwho felt like it seemed to\nwork quite well.

It effectively took LEGO and made a game\nout of it. Minecraft introduced gaming to an entire generation, while also introducing so many staple aspects of games to the industry. The ability to craft\na plethora of items, explore the almost endless (randomly generated) map and\nbuild complex architecture were all huge innovations that pushed the entire\nindustry to think differently about how they made games. It was also an indie\ngame \u2013 one that shifted the perspective on how wildly successful they could be.\nNot only this, but the constant support both from Mojang, in the form of up-dates, and from the fan base, in the form of mods, created a rich and ever growing game that had never been seen before and will likely not be seen in the same\nRedefining Open World Adventures: The Legend of Zelda Breath of the\nWild\nDespite being one of a long list of amazing Zelda games, Breath of the Wild is set\napart by its unique method of story-telling and its risky gameplay choices that\ndefinitely payed off. Breath of the Wild is unlike other Zelda games, or games in\ngeneral, in that it lets you do whatever you want, whenever you want. If you were\nso inclined (as many speed-runners are) you can go immediately from the starting area straight to the final boss and beat the game. Of course, this is extremely\ndifficult, but the very fact that you have that option, and that the difficulty of the\ngame is self-imposed, makes for a brilliant game that no 2 people will play the\nsame. However, everyone who does play Breath of the Wild can still bond over the\nbeautiful story of the 4 heroes, the incredible scenery of a post-apocalyptic Hyrule\nand the plethora of shrines that really get your brain working. Even the somewhat\nquestionable choices such as weapon durability can be praised for the way it makes\nyou adapt to every new situation, such that the game always feels fresh \u2013 whether\nyou\u2019re 2 hours in or 200.\nHonourable mentions: The Witcher 3 and Mass Effect 2 both also contributed to the\nexplosion of open-world games, and pushed the boundary in terms of immersion\nand scale of video game worlds.\nGenre-creator and Difficulty-definer: Dark Souls\nDark Souls is one of those games that does not come around often.\nIt basically created an entire genre (or at least popularised it\u2026 sorry\ndemon souls). Souls-like games are massive at the moment and it\u2019s all\nthanks to this gem. Putting aside the convention of modern games\n\u2013 being too easy \u2013 Dark Souls was BRUTALLY difficult. It honestly did\nrequire players to (sorry) Git Gud. Obviously, there is progression in the\ngame story wise, but the real progression of the game does not come\nfrom your character becoming more powerful, but instead you, the\nplayer, becoming more powerful. As you play through Dark Souls you\nlearn the ins and outs of the gameplay. Repetition is your best friends\nas you familiarise yourself with various boss\u2019patterns and finally get\nthat final blow. Even though the sequels are arguably better games, the\noriginal must be appreciated for the impact it had on people, the games\nindustry and, of course, memes. Dark Souls is truly the Dark Souls of\nDark Souls games.\nHonourable mentions: Super Meat Boy, Bloodborne, and Cuphead all\nalso contributed to reintroducing the concept of highly-challenging,\nsingle-player games to the gaming sphere.\n// Mojang\n// Nintendo // From Software\nway for a very long time. Minecraft is the biggest selling game ever, selling over\n176 million copies worldwide. I would challenge you to find anybody that does\nnot know of the game, let alone played it\u2026 whether on phone, Xbox, Switch,\nPC\u2026 the list goes on!\nHonourable mentions: Rocket League, Hellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice, Undertale,\nand Celeste all also had a massive impact on the indie scene and helped to redefine what indie \u2013 and really, all \u2013 games could achieve, whether by breaking into\nthe esports scene, addressing mental health competently, reaching AAA-quality\nhigh-fidelity graphics, or innovating gameplay mechanics.\n\n"

As someone\nwho does not own VR\n(yet), I can only speak\nfor which games I have\nplayed at conventions.\nBeat Saber is an absolute\nblast to play especially if\nyou love rhythm games. It\nis innovative and unique\n\u2013 I would love to see it\nwin. I also think that Beat\nSaber will take the award\nthis year as it is simply the\nmost well-known game as\nwell as, from what I gather\nfrom friends, the most\nloved game. Although\nwith the recent surge in\nsupport for No Man\u2019s Sky\nI wouldn\u2019t be shocked to\nsee it snag the victory.\nStrategy Game\n\u201cBest game focused on\nreal-time or turn-based\nstrategy gameplay, irrespective or platform.\u201d\nNominees: Age of\nWonders: Planetfall, Anno\n1800, Fire Emblem: Three\nHouses, Total War: Three\nKingdoms, Tropico 6 and\nWargroove.\nI love strategy games.\nThis year has been great\nfor all types, from Anno\n1800\u2019s CIV-like gameplay\nto Fire Emblem\u2019s deep\nstory-based gameplay.\nMy personal favourite of\nthe year was Wargroove.\nA spiritual successor to\nthe Advance Wars\u2019 games\nof yore, this indie game\nhas it all. Beautiful art,\nengrossing gameplay and\nplenty of replayability.\nHowever, I believe that\nFire Emblem: Three\nHouses will take the\naward. It was a huge hit,\nloved by all varieties of\ngamers \u2013 even bringing in\npeople that aren\u2019t typical\nfans of strategy games.\nThat combined with the\nmassive 100+ hour sink\nmakes for the perfect\naward winner.\nSports/Racing Game\n\u201cFor the best traditional\nand non-traditional sports\nand racing game.\u201d\nThe nominees are:\nCrash Team Nitro-Fueled,\nDirt Rally 2.0, PES 2020,\nF1 2019 and FIFA 20.\nI\u2019m not going to lie,\nI do not like F1, FIFA,\nor PES, so that\u2019s off\nthe table. The choice is\nbetween Crash and Dirt\nRally. Personally, I\u2019m on\nthe Crash side because I\nhave always loved bat-tle-racing games and this\nis no different. Although,\nI can see the side of Dirt\nRally lovers, it is realistic\nbut still maintains that\narcade-like charm (just\ndon\u2019t smash into anything\nor you\u2019ll fuck yourself).\nI think Crash will win\noverall, mainly because it\nholds that bit of nostalgia\n(being a remake), that just\nelevates it slightly above\nDirt Rally 2.0.\nScore & Music\n\u201cFor outstanding\nmusic, inclusive of score,\noriginal song and/ or\nlicensed soundtrack.\u201d\nNominees: Cadence\nof Hyrule, Death Stranding, Devil May Cry 5,\nKingdom Hearts 3 and\nSayonara Wild Hearts.\nMusic is usually what\nI remember the most\nabout games, whether it\u2019s\nthe classic do-do-dos of\nCadence of Hyrule or the\nfast-paced beats of Devil\nMay Cry, I still catch\nmyself humming it from\ntime to time. Without a\ndoubt my favourite score\nwas Cadence of Hyrule.\nThe Modern remixes of\nthe classic themes from\nZelda\u2019s past are catchy,\nuplifting and really hit\nthat nostalgia beat (pun\nintended). Being a rhythm\ngame, I would be shocked\nif Cadence of Hyrule\ndidn\u2019t win the award, what\na fantastic soundtrack it\nhas, truly.\nRole-playing Game\n\u201cFor the best game\ndesigned with rich player\ncharacter customisation\nand progression, including massively multiplayer\nexperiences.\u201d\nNominees: Disco\nElysium, Final Fantasy\nXIV, Kingdom Hearts 3,\nMonster Hunter World:\nIceborne and The Outer\nWorlds.\nRole Playing Games\nare really what gaming\nwas made for.

    "content": "SUSTAINABILITY\nFELIX ISSUE 1737\nsustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nis because there is an\nenvironmental cost for\neverything. The fact\nthat every resource is\nlimited on this planet,\ncoupled with the rising\nlevel of demand for these\nresources, tragedy of the\ncommons is the outcome.\nThese issues are large-scale and require laws,\npolicies, and international\ncooperation.\nHowever, governments\nare not doing their part,\nfocusing instead on profit\nover protecting the planet.\nFor example, the far-right president of Brazil,\nBolsonaro encouraged\nthe exploitation of the\nAmazon. As part of his\ncampaign, he promised to\nfundamentally subvert the\ncountry\u2019s long-standing\ncommitment to protect the\nAmazon. He encouraged\nand fuelled the Amazon\nfires, threatened indigenous communities, and is\ncurrently trying to shift\nthe blame of the Amazon\nfires onto NGOs and\nLeonardo Di Caprio (how\ndare he?). The tyranny\nof Bolsonaro has been\nparticularly prominent\nrecently, with the arrests\nof volunteer firefighters\nand others who are trying\nto protect the Amazon.\nCurrent regulations for\nthe forementioned issues\ndo not come close to\nopposing the threats they\npose to our planet. Indeed,\nthere are laws and regulations for fishing, but they\nare badly implemented,\nand the UK government\nhas not done as much\nwork as NGOs such as\nGreenpeace to investigate\nthe practices of the fishing\nindustry. Currently,\nthere is a fishing quota,\nbut young cods are still\nbeing illegally discarded\non an industrial scale\n(to make space for other\nmore profitable catches),\nwith the result of legal\ncatches in UK seas likely\nto have been exceeded\nby one-third. The government also claims that\n36% of England\u2019s waters\nare \u201csafeguarded as\nmarine protected areas\u201d.\nHowever, a recent paper\nin the Science journal\nfound that the trawling\nintensity in European\nprotected areas is actually\nhigher than in unprotected\nplaces. Thus, the claims\nof the government are to\ndeceive the public into\nbelieving that something\nis being done, while in\nreality, (surprise, surprise)\nthey do nothing.\nAnother interesting\nthing to note is that those\nindustries actually benefit\nvery few people, and is not\nproviding as much for the\naverage person. Greenpeace discovered that\n29% of the UK\u2019s fishing\nquota is owned by only\nfive families, all of whom\nfeature on the Sunday\nTimes Rich List. The\nmeat industry is also quite\nmonopolised, with almost\nall meat coming from 4\ncompanies in the US; it is\nlikely that the companies\nnot only exploit animals,\nbut also their workers, and\nthe money ends up going\nto the people at the top.\nAs members of society,\nwe can refrain from\nbuying products that are\ncontributing towards\nresource depletion and\nglobal pollution. This\nincludes beef (and other\nanimal products) which\nis the main cause of de-forestation. British beef,\nwhich often uses soy feed\nimported from Brazil has\nhuge amounts of carbon\nemissions. We can also\nchoose to stop eating fish\nto stop contributing to the\ndemand for an industry\nthat is killing our oceans.\nThere are alternatives\nto eating beef and fish:\nmany fish and chips shops\nin London have actually\nconverted to being fully\nplant-based and as for\nbeef, there have been\nbusinesses such as Impossible Foods Inc and\nBeyond Meat that provide\nalternatives. These companies have generated\nimmense interest, with\nBeyond Meat having the\nworld\u2019s biggest IPO pop\nsince 2000. Consumer\nchoices really matter, as\none person\u2019s actions often\ninfluence those around\nthem, a snowball effect\noccurs. As new ethical\nconsumer trends are\n\u201cCurrent\nregulations\nfor the\nmentioned\nissues are not\nproportionate\nto the threats\nto our planet\u201d\n\u201cMany of\nthose issues\nneed to be\ntargeted on an\ninternational\nscale \u201d\ncreated, unethical companies become less competitive on the market.\nThere is also an urgent\nneed for governments to\nact, as this issue needs\nto be targeted on an international scale in many\ncases. We need to spread\nawareness of the issues of\ntragedy of the commons,\nas governments are more\nthan happy to ignore\nthem, since GDP and\nprofit is all they care\nabout. We need to sign petitions (currently paused\nfor general elections, but\ndo sign them later), join\nprotests, and have our\ndemands heard. Without\nregulation, businesses and\nproducers will always act\nin their own self-interests,\nand their selfish decisions\nwill lead to horrific environmental consequences\nthat harm everyone else.\nFor the government, there\nare two main ways of\ncombatting the problem:\nthey can either assign\nownership and enforce\nthat so the producers\ntake into account the\nlong-term sustainability\nof their businesses, or the\ngovernment can enforce\nregulations, quotas and\nlaws better. It is atrocious\nthat governments are currently doing nothing. Protecting common access\nresources and preventing\ntragedy of the commons\nis an important initiative,\nand governments must act\nnow.\nIt is not impossible to\n\u201cThe ozone\nhas started\nto recover,\nbecause\nthere were\ninternational\nagreements,\nlaws and\nregulations\ncombatting\nthis issue\u201d\ncorrect the problem of\ncommon access resourc-es. In the past, when the\nozone layer was depleted\ndue to the use of CFCs\nas refrigerants, international agreements, laws\nand regulations were put\ninto place to combat this\nproblem,andtheozonehas\nstarted to recover.

From\ninternational women\u2019s\nsuffrage in the late 19th\ncentury, the American\nCivil Rights movement\nstarting in the 1950s, the\nongoing global struggle\nfor LGBT+ rights and reasonable adjustments for\npeople with disabilities.\nThe thing these all have\nin common is they are\nabout the seeking of equal\nstatus and freedom from\nall forms of oppression.\nCommunity is simply\ndefined as a group of\npeople living in one particular area or people who\nare considered as a unit\nbecause of their common\ninterests, social group,\nor nationality. Anything\nand everything can bind\ntogether communities \u2013 it\ncould be the subject you\nstudy, the sport you are\ninterested in, the country\nyou are from etc \u2013 and\nfeeling a sense of community and belonging is\ncrucial to having good\nwellbeing. Liberation and\ncommunity are intrinsically linked; discrimination\nand inequality makes it\nharder for people in some\nminority groups feel part\nof a community, but also,\nbeing part of a minority\ngroup often gives people\nanother community to feel\npart of.\nAt Imperial, liberation\nhas been, and remains to\nbe, as important as it is\nin a global sense. Just 50\nyears ago, women weren\u2019t\nallowed into the Union\nBar and the discussions\nto change this started a\nmassive fuss and resistance from the male users.\n(\u201cStay away from our\nbars, drinkers warn ICU\nwomen\u201d reads the Felix\nheadline from 1969).\nIssues persist to today;\nwe have an indisputable\ndiversity problem \u2013 the\nproportion of female,\nblack and underprivileged\nstudents here is unreflec-tive of the talent pool we\nrecruit from.And cultures,\nparticularly in academic\ncircles, can often be\ntoxic \u2013 particularly for\nminority groups.

The Athena\nSwan and Race Equality\nCharter are two schemes\nran by a UK universi-ties-wide organisation to\nimprove the access and\noutcomes of women and\nethnic minorities in higher\neducation. Imperial currently has a Silver award\nfrom theAthena Swan and\nis writing an application to\nthe Race Equality Charter\nand these will give a good\nincentive to reflect on\nthe issues these groups\nface here, and begin to\nfix them. Furthermore,\nthe College now has an\nAccess and Participation\nPlan containing tough\ntargets around brining in\nmore students from underprivileged backgrounds \u2013\nspecifically, doubling the\nnumber over 5 years.\nOn the student side, we\nhave a team of Liberation\nand Community Officers\nwhose role is to represent\nthe needs of the various\ngroups they represent\nand attempt to break\ndown barriers they face\nat Imperial. Our Liberation Officers represent\nstudents identifying in the\nlong-standing groups liberation groups \u2013 LGBT+,\nDisabled, Female and\nBME (Black & Minority\nEthnic) students. And\nCommunity Officers\nrepresent students with\nparticular community-re-lated interests \u2013 Interfaith,\nInternational, Ethics\nand Environment and\nMental Health.

But\nwith Ash \u2018did you know I\nplayed county when I was\n13\u2019 Cunningham in goal,\nand Ellie \u2018Sorry I just\nfeel so distracted today\naha\u2019 Dobson as sweeper,\nwe knew we were in safe\nhands, and Katya was a\nbit less nervous (but still\nquite nervous).\nAn unusually smooth\nstart and some divisive\nattacking play by freshers\nElla, Charlotte, and Millie\nsaw us with a few slick\ngoals by half time.\nSome rocky play in the\nsecond half, with players\neither falling over from\nstationary or misunderstanding the umpire\u2019s\nwords \u201cplease put the\nball on the line\u201d had us\nlose some momentum,\nbut at this point we were\njust pleased to know most\nof the rules. An unlucky\nbreakthrough in the final\nminute saw RUMS score\ntheir first goal, but not\nbefore we had slipped in\na few more, ending the\nmatch with a comfortable\n6-1. All in all, a captivating performance by\neveryone collaboratively\nand individually (\u201cexcept\nAsh\u201d \u2013 Henry Sewall,\nCoach), with inspiring\nteamwork and drive that\nis set to only get better as\nthe season continues.\nAfter a tough 18/19\nseason saw us struggling\nwith consistency and low\nin spirits, it is exciting to\nsee such brilliant chemistry and smooth technical\nplay that begs the question\n- is promotion finally\nwithin reach?\nSPORTS\nChloe Jeremy\nICHC Welfare Officer\n95\nICHC L2 Victorious Squad // Chloe Jeremy\nImperial Octopush battle it out in Oxford\nO\nn Saturday 30th\nNovember, the\nOctopush team\n(also known as\nUnderwater Hockey or\nUWH) played their first\ncompetition of the year at\nthe University of Oxford.\nFor the few people\nreading this who don\u2019t\nalready know, Octopush\nis a game created in 1954\nby scuba divers to help\nthem let off some steam\n(without damaging any of\ntheir incredibly expensive\nequipment). They devised\na game where teams\nwould attempt to push a\nweighted puck into a goal,\nall while holding their\nbreath underwater. The\ngame is \u2018limited\u2019 contact\nand involves ten players,\nwith six in the pool at\nany one time and four\nas substitutes. Players\nalso don a glamorous kit\nwhich includes a snorkel,\nmask, fins, a delightful\nhat, plus some specially\nmade sticks that allow the\nplayer to manoeuvre the\npuck.\nAlthough UWH is a\nvery well-known sport in\nthe UK, people often don\u2019t\nrealise that it is internationally played, with competitions hosted globally\nand attracting a diverse\nrange of people (although\nthe game still hasn\u2019t made\nit to BUCS yet). In fact,\nthe game\u2019s international\nhistory stretches as far\nback as the first world\nchampionship in Canada\nin 1980. The main reason\nthe sport hasn\u2019t reached\nOlympic status is the huge\nengineering challenges\ninvolved in making the\nsport crowd-friendly.\nIdeas have included a fully\nglass pool or a submerged\nspectator stand, however\nso far neither one has\ngained huge traction (es-pecially after the terrible\nUWH Glass Disaster of\n2001 where three players\nlost their lives). Although\nthe imperial team isn\u2019t\nquite at an international\nlevel presently, it\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s\non the agenda for coming\nyears!\nSo who is your average\nunderwater hockey\nplayer? Well, generally\nspeaking, UWH players\nderive great pleasure\nfrom the niche, edgy,\nand aggressive nature of\nthe sport. The game is\nsurprisingly fast paced\nand often involves some\nramming and the odd\nsneak attack by a fin or\nstick. The wonderful\nthing about underwater\nhockey is that collisions\nunderwater usually lead\nto much lower injury rates\nthan \u2018above-the-water\u2019\nsports. Of course, risk\nof drowning is definitely\nincreased compared to\nsay field or ice hockey\u2026.\nbut generally your team-mates/the other team\ndon\u2019t actually want to kill\nyou and will come to your\naid if need be.\nThe most recent\ntournament was last\nSaturday\u2019s competition\nin Oxford. It was against\nseveral other UK universities including Oxford,\nWarwick, Plymouth,\nand York. The Imperial\nteam successfully won\ntheir first two games\u2026\nand then promptly lost\nthe next four. However,\nthe six-person team was\nalso lacking any substitute players, meaning a\nstream of relentless games\nwith almost no breaks\nin between. Ultimately,\nImperial battled hard\n(and accidentally made a\nplayer on one team cry),\nso all in all it was a hugely\nsuccessful first compe-tition. The team is now\nlooking forward to their\nnext competition and the\nstudent nationals in 2020.\nImperial\u2019s UWH team\ntrains at Ethos pool every\nThursday evening.

    "content": "Rock throughout the ages\nFelix looks back at everything rock-related in the last 70 years, from rock and roll to pop-punk, heavy metal to\nnew wave, we have it all in our (extremely) condensed summary of rock!\nMUSIC\nEmily Freeman\nGuthrie Ruby\nMusic Editors\nT\nhe roots of rock\nas a genre are\nburied deep in the\nother sounds of\nthe 50s: blues, jazz, R&B\nand country, amalgamated\ntogether to form its own\nunique genre, known as\nrock and roll. This began\nin the deep south of the\nstates, where the first\nelectric guitars began\nto make a heavy impact\non music. Generally, the\naccepted \u201cfirst\u201d rock and\nroll number one was Bill\nHaley\u2019s \u2018Rock Around\nthe Clock\u2019, a classic\nexample of the laid-back\nboogie-inspired beat, easy\nenough to recreate in any\nmodern music classroom.\nWhilst noticeable rock\nand roll artists of the 50s\nwould also include Little\nRichard and Chuck Berry,\nthe mid-50s hailed the\nintroduction of the iconic\nElvis Presley, quite possibly the first \u201cpop star\u201d in\nthe world.\nWhilst Presley still\ndominates the early years\nof 60s, rock music is\nnow firmly in the charts,\nheld there by the British\ninvasion of legendary\nbands such as the Beatles\nand the Rolling Stones.\nGradually rock and roll\nevolved into different\ngenres of rock: psychedelic rock, pop rock, blues\nrock and folk rock. Rock\nstarted to become more\nexpressive, and as such\nmore political. Towards\nthe end of the 60s with\nopposition to the Vietnam\nWar picking up, artists\nsuch as Bob Dylan gain\npopularity. In the UK the\nstreets are ravaged with\nbattles between Mods and\nRockers. The first live\nmusicfestivalshappenand\nat the end of the decade\nthe infamous summer of\nlove has its soundtrack\nriddled with artists such as\nJimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd,\nthe Who and the Doors.\nThe start of the 70s are\nmarked by the Beatles\nbreaking up and Hendrix,\nJanis Joplin and Jim\nMorrison all dying at the\nage of 27, which relates to\na decline in psychedelic\nrock and an insurgence of\nhard rock, made prominent by bands such as Led\nZeppelin. The 70s would\nmark the introduction of\nthe bona fide rockstar,\nwith acts made big in\nthe 60s suddenly touring\nthe world in private jets.\nQueen played their first\ngig in our very own union.\nHard rock has a brief ebb\ninto glam rock, where\nDavid Bowie and T-Rex\n\u201cRock\nstarted to\nbecome more\nexpressive,\nand as such\nmore political\u201d\n\u201cA sound\nheavy with\ndistorted\nguitars, as an\nevolution of\nthe previous\nera\u201d\ncrop up, before settling\ndown into heavy rock\nwith bands such as Black\nSabbath and Deep Purple.\nAnger at prog rock fuels\nthe introduction of punk,\nas made famous by the\nSex Pistols, which then\ncalms down into new\nwave as synthesisers hit\nthe market.\nStemming from the late\n70s, the 80s showcased\nmany of the rock genres\nwe know and love today.\nNew wave continued\nwith the Joy Division\nspin-off New Order\nbefore morphing into\nnew romanticism and the\nplethora of bands which\naccompanied it including\nRoxy Music and Adam\nand the Ants. Post-punk\nappeared, fuelled by\nbands such as Siousxie\nand the Banshees, with\nthe genre then splitting\ninto goth and heavy metal.\nThe latter genre notably\nbrought forward many\nbands still current today:\nIron Maiden, Metallica,\nSlayer and Anthrax\namongst others.\nThroughout the decade\npost-punk went through a\nchange, with underground\nbands such as the Smiths\nand the Cure finding\ngreat success and hitting\nthe mainstream. Towards\nthe end of the decade\nalternative rock and its\nsub-genres pop-punk and\ngrunge began to expand,\npaving the way for the\nsound of the 90s.\nIn the early 90s grunge\nbands such as Nirvana and\nPearl Jam began emerging\nfrom the pacific northwest\nofAmerica.Asound heavy\nwith distorted guitars and\nlittle polish were an evolution of the post-punk era\nfrom the previous decade.\nIn the UK bands like Pulp,\nOasis and Blur took on the\ngrunge genre and developed into the beginning of\nbritpop. After the unfortunate death of Kurt Cobain,\nthe grunge genre began to\nwane in popularity transforming into the more\ncommercially acceptable\nform post-grunge. Skate/\npop-punk exploded\nmid-decade thanks to\nindependent labels giving\nthe genre a new platform,\nmost notably Green Day\nand Blink-182. Indie\nrock bands continued in\nthe underground scene\nwith legends including\nPixies, Sonic Youth and\nPavement.\nThe pop/post-punk\ngenre had taken main\nstage at the end of the\n90s and remained a titan\nfor the first half of the\n00s. Most of us have\nmemories of screaming\nalong to \u2018Sk8er Boi\u2019, \u2018All\nthe Small Things\u2019 and\n\u2018American Idiot\u2019. Garage\nand new wave revival\ntook hold at the same\ntime. The Killers, The\nWhite Stripes and Interpol\ndominated the scene with\nlegendary albums \u2013 Is\nThis It, White Blood Cells\nand Turn On the Bright\nLights. Lateralus by Tool\nis still championed as one\nof the greatest heavy metal\nrecords in history. In the\nlatter half of the decade\npop was crushing rock in\nthe charts. Independent\ninternet radio stations and\nblogs helped indie rock\nrise from the underground\nand become the height of\nrock with stars such as\nArcade Fire, MGMT, and\nVampire Weekend.\nThis decade indie\nrock has become the\nmainstream of rock\nmusic, with a much softer\nand refined sound than\ndecades earlier. However,\nwith streaming platforms\ndemocratising the music\nindustry all sub-genres\nare still surviving. Psychedelic rock in particular\nhas taken off with Tame\nImpala, Mac DeMarco,\nKing Gizzard & the Lizard\nWizard, and Homeshake.\nAdditionally, the longer\nstanding artists of years\ngone by have been putting\nout spectacular music\ntoo, including Radiohead,\nDavid Bowie (rip), AC/\nDC and Nick Cave. A\nresurgence in post-punk\nled by bands like Idles and\nSlaves has led to modern\npunk, which may well be\nthe future of the genre.\nNo matter what, rock has\nendured over seventy\ndecades and brought with\nit a plethora of timeless\nalbums, fashions and\nmemories.\nThe Beatles - one of the first bands to revolutionise rock into the mainstream // Wikimedia\nISSUE 1737\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n55\n\n"

If they don\u2019t\nkeep material it will be\nlost. It is important for\nveracity and their future\nlives and historically too.\nThat\u2019s a message I\u2019d like\nto get across to people.\nFor records generally,\nit\u2019s important to make\ndecisions about what is\nto be retained, and for\nhow long. There are many\nissues to consider in this.\nThe Archives creates and\nmanages a Records Retention Schedule which\nlists college records and\ntheir retention or disposal\ntime periods. This is\nonline.\nFelix: You also handle\nFreedom of Information requests \u2013 that\u2019s\nvery current, rather\nthan\u2018looking back\u2019\nas you say, and has a\nvital remit in terms\nof ensuring transpar-ency. How does that\nplay into your role?\nI think our FOI system\nis very good. It is run\nby Central Secretariat\nwhich oversees College\ngovernance, of which the\nArchives is part. We are\nwell placed to find the\nrequired information from\ncontacts across College.\nWe all value transparency\nand accuracy of infor-mation, which is of very\ngreat importance.\nFelix: Who do you\nwork with around\nthe College?\nWehaveadigitalpreservation system I have brought\nin, called Archivematica,\nwhich has been picked\nup by quite a few other\nsystems in college \u2013 such\nas the library, tied into\ntheir SPIRAL system.\nArchivematica is an\nultimate system \u2013 things\nwill be kept forever \u2013 and\nputting it there instead\nmeans SPIRAL doesn\u2019t\nget clogged. They don\u2019t\nwant to keep every paper\non SPIRAL forever, but\nthey can transfer it after\nto an iteration of Archivematica, or another similar\nsystem.\nFelix: Is there any\nother work you do\nwith the library?\nIn a few ways \u2013 a personal\nfavourite is that every year\nduring Women\u2019s Week,\nI and several colleagues\naround the College run\na women\u2019s \u2018Wikithon\u2019,\nwhich is editing and correcting Wikipedia pages,\nin the library computer\nroom. It\u2019s a great thing\nto do and a good skill to\nhave. The Wikimedians\nand colleagues who join\nus are great because they\ngive tuition to newcomers.\nFelix: Who else\ndo you work with\naround College?\nWe work across College\nand so, at sometime or\nanother, that will be with\nall academic and administrative departments. We\nalso manage the records,\nnot just archives, which\nare slightly different. The\nformer is about current\nrecords which need to\nbe kept for some period,\nor for longevity, and so\nwe look at the records\nlifecycle: from creation to\nwhen it no longer needs\nto be used currently but\nforms evidence of College\nbusiness.\nFelix: What are some\nof your favourite moments \u2013 either odd\nrequests you\u2019ve received or a favourite\nitem in the archives\nthemselves?\nOne time we had a letter\ndelivered addressed to the\n\u201cCollege Alchemist\u201d \u2013 if\nI could turn things into\ngold, I wouldn\u2019t be here!\nMy favourite archival\nstuff is based on the 19th\ncentury RSM records! For\na very long time I\u2019ve been\ndoing a PhD thesis on a\nseries of lectures called\n\u201cLectures to Working\nMen\u201d, which was set up\nby the RSM in the 1850s\n\u2013 it was the first govern-ment-funded higher education institute, so it had\nto \u2018give something back\u2019.\nIt did occasional lectures\nwhich were open to the\npublic, but it then wanted\nto do something specific\nfor artisan-class people\nwho were very skilled\nin their jobs. They had\nto get permission from\ntheir foreman in order to\ngo just for the evening!\nAnd they loved it; it ran\nfor 49 years. The lectures\nwere on everything that\nwas taught at College to\nmatriculated students, at\nthe same level \u2013 and they\nalso did a lot of extra ones\nat British Association\nmeetings and such, which\ntravelled around the\ncountry.\nIt\u2019s social history as well\nas scientific history, as\nwell as professionalisation\ndevelopment of scientific\ncareers, which were very\ndifferent from now. The\nseries eventually stopped\nbecause education\nchanged hugely, and there\nwere a lot of other organisations like the Workers\u2019\nEducational Association\nwhich came in. There\nwere more evening classes\nand night schools, and\nmore vocational options.\nIt\u2019s a shame it didn\u2019t make\n50 years. There was a real\nzeitgeist for educational\nself-help in those days.\nFelix: Do you think\nthat\u2019s missing now?\nWell, there are lots of op-portunities, lots of things\nonline \u2013 but there is a cost\nto them, they maybe too\nexpensive for the people\nwho need them to do.\nThe Open University is\nstill going. More people\nare encouraged to go to\nuniversity now, so there\u2019s\na change in outlook.\nApprenticeships, which\nthe government are trying\nto bring back in a modern\nform, are really important,\nbecause there are a lot\nof people who actually\nwould benefit more from\ndoing something practical\nand that\u2019s where their\nexpertise lies, rather than\ntrying to shoehorn themselves into a university\ncourse.\nFelix: You mentioned\nworking on a PhD\nthesis; are there\nother projects you\u2019ve\nworked on?\nI\u2019ve also written a book\nabout women at Imperial!\nWomen at Imperial\nCollege Past, Present and\nFuture.\nI was asked to do this\nby a couple of the senior\nwomen in the College\nsome time ago \u2013 Dot Griffiths OBE in the Business\nSchool and Dame Julia\nHiggins in Chemical\nEngineering \u2013 and it\nsort of just grew. They\nasked me at a time when\nit would only have been\na monograph, but with\nthe increasing number of\nwomen it just took off.\nMy premise was that there\nhave always been women\nhere, even if sometimes\nthey might have been\nignored \u2013 though often,\nto be fair, they weren\u2019t.\nEven in early days at the\nRoyal College of Chemistry,(1845) the German\nchemist Hoffman brought\nhis wife and his sister\nwho were doing assaying\non metals and testing\ntheir compositions. T.H.\nHuxley took his wife\nsea-dredging on their\nhoneymoon!\nThere\u2019s a good saying\nwhich is that \u201cno scientist\nworks in a vacuum\u201d, as\nwe said earlier! Their\nlives and family lives are\nreally important. If I\u2019m\ncollecting papers, I don\u2019t\nwant published papers,\nI want the manuscript\npapers \u2013 I want to know\nwhat they were doing.\nRelatedly, I run the Centre\nfor Scientific Archives,\nwhich is a charitable\ncataloguing organisation,\nwhich at the moment has\na project to digitise their\npast catalogues \u2013 at the\nmoment they\u2019re just flat\npaper which is hopeless to\nsearch, so we\u2019re making\nit cross-searchable and\nadding things like block-chain elements for verification of ideas and dis-coveries. You can find out\na lot more about people\nand their interactions and\nideas this way, find out\nif two different people\nhad correspondence if it\nwasn\u2019t known before, for\nexample. And this is a\ncultural blockchain, not fi-nancial, so it\u2019s not huge in\ncomputing power. Again,\nthe role always requires\nme to be looking forward\nand learning new things.\nThe original Imperial College building // Imperial College London Archives\n\n"

So here is my\nselection, a bit eclectic I\nwould say, and since there\nis no way to rank these\ngems, I present them in\nalphabetical order \u2013 enjoy.\nBROKEN FLOWERS\n(2005)\nIt starts like this: Don\u2019s\norderly but monotonous\nlife is shaken up when he\ngets dumped by his fianc\u00e9\nand then finds out he has a\nson. We follow him across\nthe US as he tracks down\nhis ex-lovers, trying to\nfigure out which one is the\nmother of his child. It\u2019s\nquite melancholic, seeing\nhow the main character\ndevelops with every encounter with an old flame,\nreminded of the fact that\nas time passes, people\nchange and most relationships turn out to be futile\nand temporary. The film is\nalso gripping as it engages\nyou in Don\u2019s search for\nclues. On the whole it\u2019s\njust brilliantly written,\nwith great attention to\ndetail, like little quirks\nand habits that make each\ncharacter unique and\nbelievable. It doesn\u2019t give\nout too much information,\nhowever, leaving some\nthings unsaid, which I\nthink is Broken Flowers\u2019\ngreatest strength.\nDANGEROUS LIAISONS\n(1988)\nThe biggest surprise\nof the year for me. Certainly not a fan of period\ndramas, I found this film\nunbelievably absorbing,\ncoating and the desire to\nmanipulate and shatter\nsome hearts that makes\nDangerous Liaisons\nactually a very dark film.\nGHOST WORLD (2001)\nI have done it countless\ntimes: added a film to my\nwatchlist after seeing a\nstill on Instagram or else-where, interested solely in\nthe visual side of it. That\nwas the case with Ghost\nWorld, which initially\nintrigued me with its lethargic suburban vibe, but\nturned out to be so much\nmore. Based on a comic\nbook that I\u2019ve yet to read,\nthis is a story of two high\nschool graduates, bored\nand cynical, roaming\naround in their sleepy\nneighbourhood. Although\nthe film feels subtle and\nmuted, it does call up\nstrong feelings, since Enid\nand Rebecca\u2019s fear of\nconformity and desperate\nattempts to be original are\nhilarious and painfully\nsad at the same time. It\u2019s\nremarkable how well this\nfilm sums up the mood\nand doubts you have as\nyou step into adulthood.\nmale prostitutes on the\nstreets of Seattle. The\nmain character, Mike,\nbeautifully played by\nRiver Phoenix, lives a life\ndisturbed by narcoleptic\nepisodes. He just evokes\nso much sympathy that\nyou spend the two hours\naching and hoping with\nhim, while he tries to\nfind his long lost mother.\nNonetheless, it\u2019s amazing\nthat a film touching on\nloss, vulnerability and\nsearch for acceptance\nremains humorous and\nsimply fun to watch. Its\ndynamic editing is note-worthy, funnier sequences\nalternate with moments of\ndeep reflection (campfire\nscene being hands down\nthe most poignant of the\nyear) and the take on sex\nscenes is as unusual as it is\namusing. My Own Private\nIdaho really stands out\nwith its unique dreamy\natmosphere.\nPARASITE (2019)\nLastly, the only film on\nmy list that was actually\nreleased in 2019. Having\nheard only enthusiastic\nreviews, I was really\nlooking forward to this\none and it did live up to\nmy expectations. It is\na story of two families\nand a look on social ine-qualities, but the less you\nknow before watching,\nthe better. Suffice it to\nsay, atmosphere changes\ndrastically throughout\nthe film, which makes\nfor an entertaining but\nalso thought-provoking\nand aesthetically pleasing\nexperience. A rather\nambiguous ending is, in\nmy opinion, another perk\nof this film, as it doesn\u2019t\nfeel like a didactic tale but\ngives you space for your\nown interpretation and\njudgement. Coming to the\nUK in early 2020, this one\nis not to be missed.\nBung Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite // CJ Entertainment\nTaking a look at the best film\u2019s viewed this year, I\u2019ve bottled them up into 5 unmissable features to look at during\nthe winter break\nFILM\nZuzanna Janusz\nFilm Writer\n33\n\u201cIt\u2019s the\ncontrast\nbetween the\nsugar coating\nand the desire\nto manipulate\nthat makes\nDangerous\nLiaisons\nactually very\ndark\u201d\nmainly thanks to incredible acting \u2013 Glenn Close\nand John Malkovich both\ngive remarkable performances and the tension\nbetween them is insane.\nCombine that with elaborate costumes that inspire\nhaute couture fashion\ndesigners to this day and\nyou won\u2019t be able to take\nyour eyes off the screen.\nMind you, all these lavish\nvisuals and the abundance\nof decoration are there\nto hide true intentions of\nmain characters.

    "content": "MONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019 FELIX\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n6\nThe Ongoing Direction of the Union\nLast week, Felix reported that the Managing Director of the Union, Jarlath O\u2019Hara, was stepping down, with\nJon Tucker to provide interim support. We provide an update on the situation and a discussion on the ongoing\ndirection of the Union.\nNEWS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nI\nt has been confirmed\nthat Jon Tucker, the\nBusiness School\u2019s\nFaculty Operating\nOfficer, will be providing\ninterim support to the\nUnion following the departure of the Managing\nDirector.\nThe decision was made\nafter a discussion with\nCollege by Jill Finney,\nthe Chair of the Union\u2019s\nBoard of Trustees, the\ngroup whose responsibility it is to oversee the\nUnion\u2019s activities. The\nBoard was consulted\nvia email and telephone\nabout the decision, in the\nabsence of a scheduled\nmeeting, but retains the\nability to overturn it at the\nnext Board meeting on\nTuesday 10th December.\nJill clarified that the\ndecision needed to be\nmade swiftly such that\nthe organisation could\ncontinue to function,\nhence not waiting for\nthe next meeting. \u201cThat\nwe haven\u2019t had a Board\nmeeting does not mean\nthe Board should not take\naction on an issue that\nneeds to be dealt with\nrapidly; it has to respond\nregardless of when the\nmeetings are fixed.\u201d\nThe Board will also\ndiscuss the timeline for\nrecruiting a new full-time\nManaging Director, as\nwell as receiving a presentation from Jon on how\nhe envisions his role in\nthe organisation.\nThe decision has\nprompted queries about\nthe Union\u2019s ability to be\neffective in advocating\nfor students if the College\nis actively engaged\nin the Union\u2019s senior\nmanagement. Regarding\nthe choice to approach\nCollege to ask for recom-mendations, rather than\nsearching externally, Jill\nsaid that \u201cthis was the\nmost expedient model for\nensuring student and staff\nsupport in the short-term.\u201d\nShe also emphasised that\n\u201cthere are clear lines\nbetween College helping\nus to be an independent\nrobust Union, and the\nUnion\u2019s ability to negotiate and to take on issues.\nThey are completely di-visible, just as discussions\nabout Union finances\ndo not interfere with the\nongoing negotiation about\nhalls fees.\u201d\nAbhijay Sood, the\nUnion President, offered\nclarity on Jon\u2019s position\nwithin the Union: \u201cJon\nhas a lot of experience\nwith how both business\nand charities function,\nso we want to play to his\nstrengths and have him\nadvise us on how to rectify\nsome of the foundational\nchallenges the Union is\nfacing at the moment.\nHe is not an interim\nManaging Director, he\nis not a Chief Operating\nOfficer. He is not here to\ntell us what to do, he is\nhere to tell us what we can\ndo in terms of what will be\neffective. He is advising\nand mostly liaising to get\nsupport from the College\non operational activities\nlike data protection,\nrecruitment, or building\nmaintenance. Having met\nJon, any concerns about\nconflicts of interest have\nvery much been allayed.\u201d\nJarlath O\u2019Hara, the\noutgoing Managing\nDirector, added that he\nbelieves that this opens\nnew opportunities going\nforwards.\u201cWhensomeone\nwho is known and trusted\nsays to the College the\nsame things the Union has\nbeen saying for a while,\nmaybe it will land firmer.\u201d\nHe also said that Jon\u2019s experience in the Business\nSchool will help to offer a\n\u201clens of consistency\u201d with\nregards to how the Union\nand College interact, in\nline with how the\nCollege interacts with\nfaculties, on the areas\nwhere parallels can be\ndrawn such as building\nmaintenance.\nRegarding his depar-ture, Jarlath said that this\nwas the least disruptive\ntime for him to step\ndown \u2013 despite the major\nwork ongoing with the\nUnion\u2019s negotiations on\nhalls rent. In essence, the\nreasoning behind it is a\ndifference of management\nstyles \u2013 he has a particular\nmethod, and the Union\u2019s\nongoing needs require\nsomething different; a\nstyle that he was not\ninterested in carrying\nforward, and meant that it\nwas a \u201chealthy time\u201d for a\nchange and a \u201cfresh pair\nof eyes\u201d on the Union\u2019s\nissues.\nHe also discussed with\nFelix the troubles currently facing the Union, and\nthe ongoing direction he\nbelieves they need to take.\nTwo major issues facing\nthe Union in the past 12\nmonths have been establishing their prioritisation\nwith regards to provision\nof different services, as\nwell as ensuring clear\nremit and accountability\nboth internally and with\nregards to the split of\nresponsibilities between\nthemselves and College.\nExamples include the\nongoing work on health\nand safety issues in the\nUnion kitchens, as well as\ngeneral maintenance work\non the building \u2013 which\nthe Union is currently\nliaising with the College\u2019s\nEstates division about.\nPart of the reason for the\ndisruption has been a lack\nof clear communication\nand understanding about\nwhat areas fall under\nwhose remit. These two\nissues will be driving\nfactors in the Union\u2019s new\nstrategy for 2020-23.\nAnother has been staff\nturnover. Though some\ndirectorates within the\nUnion have remained\nstable, others have been\ndecimated \u2013 with the\nworst-affected being the\nActivities team, which\nsaw all three Coordinator\nroles depart within a short\ntime-frame. Part of the\ncause is, Jarlath says, a\n\u201cculture of development\u201d\nthat is intrinsic to the\nUnion \u2013 the encouragement of staff to take on\nand do more. This encourages progression, but with\nfewer management roles\navailable as one moves\nup the hierarchy, this\nactively promotes higher\nturnover, which the Union\nhas failed to account for in\nterms of its structure and\nprocesses. As Jarlath put\nit, \u201cif you\u2019re going to consciously fuel that cycle,\nyou need better things in\nplace to mitigate against\nthe turnover.\u201d\nApossible restructuring\nof the Union is therefore\non the cards having been\ndiscussed at management\nand Board level; a more\n\u201cagile\u201d way of working\nthat allows flexibility\nin addressing emerging\nneeds and changing prior-ities.\nFurthermore, criticisms\nhave been levied that the\nUnion has been too compliant to the College on\nissues negatively affecting\nstudents. However, Jarlath\nviews this as a problem\nwith visibility and com-munication. Often, the\nUnion will oppose the\nCollege on issues, but\nnot in a publicly visible\nway \u2013 a consequence of\nthe \u201ccollaborative\u201d style\nthat he and previous\nsabbatical officers have\nadopted. \u201cThere are\nofficers and unions who\nare good at shouting about\nhow great they are, but\ndon\u2019t do a lot. It\u2019s tough\nbecause communicating\ntakes time \u2013 so you end\nup having less impact in\norder to communicate it,\nbecause it takes time away\nfrom what you\u2019re doing.\nAnd yet the Union suffers\nreputationally from not\nbeing visible with stuff\nthat happens.\u201d\nFinally, he shared what\nhe feels are personal successes during his time in\nthe Union, and his passion\nfor the organisation. \u201cIn\nterms of success, I view it\nalong the lines of what the\norganisation has achieved\nwhile I\u2019ve been leading\nstaff member, not just\nwhat I have personally\ndone. I am proud of introducing the Wellbeing Rep\nNetwork, and that despite\na poor financial year last\nyear we are in a stronger\nand healthier position\n\u201cThere are\nclear lines\nbetween\nCollege\nhelping\nus to be\nindependent\nand robust,\nand the\nUnion's ability\nto negotiate\nissues\u201d\n\u201cThere are\nofficers and\nunions who\nare good at\nshouting\nabout how\ngreat they are,\nbut don't do a\nlot\u201d\ntoday than when I joined\nfour years ago. Most of\nall, I\u2019d point to us continuing to outperform \u2013 I\nknow that we are the envy\nof many unions, students,\nand universities in terms\nof our CSPs, election\nturnout, systems work\nwith eActivities, and so\non.\u201d\n\u201cI want to say that I\u2019ve\nhad a really great experience for the last four\nyears. It\u2019s a fantastic role,\na brilliant organisation,\nand I think the stuff that\nwe do is incredible \u2013 with\n\u2018we\u2019 being 99% students.\nIt\u2019s been a privilege to be\nin this position for four\nyears. I\u2019ve been in unions\nfor 20 years, and I abso-lutely, coming into the\nrole, saw it as the pinnacle\nof the student movement\n\u2013 there\u2019s no role I\u2019d want\nabove it within the student\nmovement, and it\u2019s felt\nlike that every day I was\nin the role.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Tepid Reviews for Dear Evan Hansen?\nThe Broadway awards juggernaut arrives in London to less than glowing reviews.... but is this justified?\nI\nt was rather surprising to me that\nthe majority of the\nprofessional reviews\nfor Dear Evan Hansen,\nthe Broadway juggernaut\nthat just made its way to\nthe West End stage, have\nbeen rather tepid. Unlike\nits Broadway counterpart,\nwhich was showered\nwith endless praise and\na plethora of five star\nreviews, it seems that in\nLondon, most reviewers\nhave enjoyed the show,\njust not enough to give it\nthe glowing 5 stars that\neveryone was convinced\nit would be getting.\nOver the last month or\nso, I was lucky enough to\nsee the show twice (thank\nyou, random stranger on\nTwitter who gave me his\nextra ticket). And I loved\nevery second of it.\nWith the music and\nlyrics written by Benj\nPasek and Justin Paul\n(the writers behind the\nmusic of The Greatest\nShowman), and book\nby Steven Levenso,\nDear Evan Hansen tells\nthe story of an anxious\nteenager, Evan, who finds\nhimself in a web of lies,\npretending to be best\nfriends with a classmate\nwho commited suicide.\nOne of the show\u2019s main\nstrengths is the witty,\nsharp songwriting which\ntakes the audience on a\nrollercoaster of emotions.\nThe show isn\u2019t overtly sad,\nhowever there are some\nundertones that touch on\nvery sensitive topics that\nsuccessfully manages to\nget an emotional reaction\nfrom the audience. None\nof it is overly soppy\ndespite exploring heavy\nthemes with sufficient\ndepth.\nIt is also gorgeously\nstaged, reflecting images\nof social media platforms\non the stage and on many\nscreens, driving home its\npoint regarding the impact\nof technology on today\u2019s\nteenagers\u2019 lives. The\nchoreography is also quite\ngorgeous, with constant\ncallbacks to earlier bits of\nthe performance, perfectly\nsupplementing the lyrics.\nMy only complaint\nabout the show is that the\nfirst half of the second\nact kind of drags, mainly\nbecause it contains some\nof the weaker songs in the\nmusical, but this doesn\u2019t\ntake away much from the\noverall viewing experi-ence. My least favourite\n\u201cThe first half\nof the second\nact kind of\ndrags, mainly\nbecause it\ncontains some\nof the weaker\nsongs in the\nmusical\u201d\n\u201cSam Tutty,\nfresh out\nof drama\nschool, does a\ncommendable\njob as Evan,\nexecuting the\nemotional\ndepth of the\ncharacter\nperfectly\u201d\nsong in the musical is\neasily \u2018To Break In a\nGlove\u2019. While I get why\nsong is placed where it\nhas been placed, and the\npurpose it serves in the\nstory. The metaphor is\ncrystal clear (maybe a bit\ntoo on the nose at times).\nit\u2019s just a bit of a dud\nin comparison to what\ncomes before and after.\nDespite falling in love\nwith the show head over\nheels, I\u2019d like to put my\nown two cents in and\nexplore why the reception\nhas been rather lukewarm\non this side of the pond.\nWithout a seed of doubt\nin my mind, I believe that\nthe main reason for the\nrather lukewarm reception is rooted within the\nsky-high expectations of\nthe show. Having opened\non Broadway in 2016, the\noriginal cast recording\nhas been available on\nevery music streaming\nservice for 3 years now.\nIt is unlikely that those\nwho are well versed in\nthe world of musical\ntheatre haven\u2019t heard at\nleast some of the show\u2019s\nmusic, given the amount\nof positive publicity the\nshow has received over\ntime. Therefore, when the\nshow finally made its way\nto London, it was\u2026 old\nnews?\nHaving mentioned the\noriginal Broadway cast\nrecording, I would be\nremiss if I did not talk\nabout the original London\ncast. Sam Tutty, fresh out\nof drama school, does\na commendable job as\nEvan, executing the emotional depth of the character perfectly. However,\nvocally, he is no Ben Platt.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Tutty\nis a great vocalist and\nprobably a more believable high school student,\nbut whoever was cast as\nEvan would have most\nlikely been a step down\nfrom Platt, whose vocals\nstill blow me away every\ntime I listen to the original\ncast recording. Platt\u2019s\ncareer was propelled to\nnew heights, releasing\nan album and starring in\na Netflix original show,\nwhich doesn\u2019t come as a\nsurprise given how much\nbuzz there was around\nDear Evan Hansen in the\nStates, mainly surrounding Platt.\nSome reviews pointed\nout that the show\u2019s storyline is too far-fetched,\nwhich I wholeheartedly\ndisagree with. The show\ndoes take some leaps here\nand there, sure. However,\nwhen Aladdin and\nJasmine flew on a magic\ncarpet, no one called it out\nfor being too far-fetched.\nSuspension of disbelief is\nan important part of the\ntheatregoing experience,\nand Dear Evan Hansen\nmakes use of this in the\nbest way possible to touch\non so many important\nproblems plaguing today\u2019s\nyouth, such as anxiety, de-pression, suicide and the\nrole of technology in all\nof this. Perhaps one of the\nreasons why the same plot\nwas seen as far-fetched in\nthe UK while being called\ngroundbreaking in the\nStates may be the vastly\ndifferent high school experiences between the two\ncountries. Who knows.\nOverall, Dear Evan\nHansen is an excellent\nshow, touching on\nmany important issues\nsurrounding the youth in\nthis day and age. It is a\nshow that is written about\nyoung people, for young\npeople. I would jump at\nan opportunity to get to\nwatch the show again\n(and again), but I do understand why middle aged\nreviewers who\u2019ve been\nfamiliar with the material,\nperformed by a completely different cast, for years\nwould be slightly let down\nby the final product on the\nLondon stage.\nThe impact of social media on the youth is front and centre in Dear Evan Hansen // Matthew Murphy\nFELIX\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019\n26\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nOzbil Ege Dumenci\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Additionally,\nsome teams have taken\nsteps to promote welfare\nby having designated\nwelfare positions within\ntheir clubs.

I was better\nat these activities, but\nI never became serious\nwith any of them. Unfortunately, it was around\nthis time that my family\nlife became chaotic and\nstressful. One of my\nsiblings had been getting\ninto trouble at school and\nthis steadily worsened. It\nculminated in them being\nimprisoned. Additionally,\nanother sibling\u2019s mental\nhealth deteriorated\nleading to them being hos-pitalised. These stresses\ncontributed to me neglecting sport and choosing\nless wholesome activities.\nI did start heading to the\ngym recreationally and\nthrough that I met a mate\nwho convinced me to start\nAmerican football. Up to\nthat point I had only tried\nsome mixed martial arts\nand rugby, but from that I\nreally enjoyed contact.\nIn Britain, rugby is\noften held at a higher\nesteem than American\nfootball. I feel this is\nunjust. They are both very\ndifferent and I\u2019d describe\nrugby as a contact sport\nand American football\nas an impact sport. This\ndistinction is important\nas it gives insight as\nto why I came to like\nit so much. Arguably,\nthe tackles in American\nfootball are more aggres-sive; gang-tackling and\ntackling in mid-air are\ncommon. Each \u201cplay\u201d is\ntypically seconds, whilst\nrugby \u201cphases\u201d tend to be\nlonger.

At\nthat time, weekends were\nspent visiting psychiatric\nwards or prison. Having\nto reconcile my role as a\nyoung carer and general\nteenage angst was diffi-cult. It led me to not being\nable to open-up about my\nrole as a carer for several\nyears, if I\u2019m honest I\nstill struggle opening up\nnow. American football\nprovided me with stabil-ity, a second family, and\na place to escape chaos. I\ncredit sport as a contributing factor to achieving my\ngrades and securing my\nplace at Imperial.\nPrior to starting at\nImperial, I undertook a\nyear-in-industry in Kent.\nThis was a big move for\na seventeen-year-old, but\nit was an opportunity to\nallow my family to heal\n(without having to worry\nabout me) and to save for\nImperial. In hindsight, my\nstoic \u2018selfless\u2019 act was not\nwise, and I recognise lots\nweekends where I didn\u2019t\nleave my room or speak\nto anyone.

Our\nmost senior member of\nstaff is stepping down,\nthe kitchens are closed,\nand student officers, in\nparticular the deputy pres-idents, have had to work\novertime to compensate\nfor understaffing in the\noffice.\nDespite this, the Union\nis standing firm. We\u2019re\ntriaging our issues, so we\nknow what needs to be\naddressed immediately\nand what we can take time\nover. We\u2019re recruiting new\nstaff across all our direc-torates, with at least one\nstudent officer on every\ninterview panel. Through\nall this, we\u2019re maintaining\nour commitment to representing the interests of\nstudents to improve our\ncollective experience at\nImperial. On h-bar, space\non campus, UG and PG\nstudent satisfaction, halls\nrent, ethical investment,\nand so much more, we\u2019re\nworking hard to make\nsure your voice is heard,\nand that students come\nfirst when decisions are\nbeing made at Imperial.\nWe welcome the help\nthe College is offering us\nat the moment, and much\nof it should continue once\nour immediate issues are\nresolved. But it\u2019s important that we retain our\nautonomy, so that when\nthe dust settles, the voice\nof students hasn\u2019t been\nweakened. We want to\nwork together as partners\nresolving a common\nissue, a frame of reference I know many senior\nmembers of staff in the\nCollege agree with.\nWhatever our challeng-not being oppositional for\nits own sake, but firmly\nand constructively raising\nissues where we don\u2019t\nagree with what\u2019s being\ndone. Wherever possible,\nwe want to find ways we\ncan collaborate, and make\ndecisions that benefit\nstudents, staff, and senior\nmanagement, without\ncompromising our underlying principles.\nOn ethical investment,\nthis has meant finding\na way to have tough\nconversations about the\nconsequences of where\nImperial puts its money.\nOn halls rent, it has meant\ngoing back to the College\nand telling them that\nwhat\u2019s being proposed is\nunacceptable to students,\nand that we need to do\nsomething different.\nIn both of these cases,\nthough it has caused some\ndiscomfort on both sides,\nwe\u2019ve found a way to\npush forward together: a\nworking group where we\nhave equal footing with\nstaff for the former, and\na full negotiation without\npredetermined confines\nfor the latter.\nHowever, our ability to\ndo anything meaningful as\na Union depends largely\non the extent to which\nother students are willing\nto act. If they don\u2019t feel\nthey can do anything, we\ncan only do whatever our\nskills in persuasion and\nthe goodwill of individual\nstaff members allows.\nHowever, if they\u2019re\nwilling to get involved,\nour ability to make meaningful change multiplies.\nFor now, that mainly\nmeans spreading the word.\nTell a friend about the\ndispute over halls rent\nor the push on ethical\ninvestment (see the\narticles on pages 4 & 5).\nIf you\u2019d like to do more,\non rent: fill in the register\nof interest at tiny.cc/\nrentregister; on ethical\ninvestment: consider\nmaking a written submission to sri.policy@\nimperial.ac.uk with\nyour thoughts on where\nImperial should and\nshouldn\u2019t be investing\nits money.\nTogether, we have\nan opportunity to make\nsome real changes to the\nway Imperial works; I\nhope that\u2019s something\nwe can take advantage\nof this year.\n\u201cNot being\noppositional\nfor its own\nsake, but\nfirmly and\nconstructively\nraising issues\u201d\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer experts\nand grammar nerds to join our team.

    "content": "5\nISSUE 1737\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRent Price\nfloor was opened to students for questions and contributions, and the proposal was voted on\nPembridge Hall will be removed from the halls offering in 2020-21 // Neville Miles\nThese two changes to the\nCollege\u2019s accommodation\nportfolio mean that 49%\nof freshers will be living\nin North Acton next year.\nThe year before the North\nActon halls opened to stu-dents, it was decided by\nthe Union that the price\nper square meter of North\nActon rooms versus non-North Acton rooms would\nbe 1:2; accounting not\nonly for the distance and\ntravel costs incurred when\ntravelling from North\nActon to get to class, but\nalso ensuring that there\nwas some sort of affordable accommodation on\nthe portfolio.\nWhile the total revenue\ngenerated from rent must\ncomply with an overall\nmodel decided by the\nCollege, the distribution\nof rent price across halls\nand rooms is delegated\nto the Union. With a\nchanging accommodation\nportfolio, on top of the\nproposed 12.2% rent\nhike, things get much\nmore complicated. In the\noriginal paper brought to\nCouncil, the Union President and Deputy President\n(Welfare) laid out four\npotential options for how\nthis 12.2% increase could\nbe distributed across\nNorth Acton and South\nKensington halls (any hall\nthat is not in North Acton\nis considered to be South\nKensington-centric).\nThese options ranged\nfrom a flat increase of\n12.2% across all halls, to a\n20% NorthActon increase\nand 8% South Kensington\nincrease. The decision on\nprice distribution largely\ndepends on balancing the\navailability of affordable\nhousing options for\nfirst-year students whilst\nsimultaneously avoiding\nsplitting the fresher cohort\ninto North Acton/South\nKensington communities\nthat have large wealth\ndisparities. First-year\nhalls are crucial to building a community where\nthe student body is well\nintegrated and everyone\nfeels a sense of belonging;\nthis would be incredibly\ndifficult to achieve if the\nprice gap between South\nKensington and North\nActon halls were to grow\nmuch larger, which would\nessentially segregate students by wealth.\nThough the 12.2%\nhike was ultimately voted\ndown by Union Council,\nCollege is under no real\nobligation to comply\nwith this decision. Union\nPresident Abhijay Sood\nhas said about the Council\u2019s rejection of the rent\nhike, \"The preference\nof College Campus Services would have been\nfor Union Council to\naccept their break-even\nmodel, and endorse one\nparticular version of what\nthey put forward. Union\nCouncil did not feel that\nthey could endorse that,\nand Shervin (Deputy\nPresident (Welfare)) and\nI did not personally feel\nwe could endorse that\nbecause of how steep the\nproposed increases are.\nWe went back to them\nand they have expressed a\nwillingness for us to work\ntogether to get through\nthis impasse.\n\u201cWe have established\nthat we have a lot of\ncommon ground - we\nall want to reach an\nagreement, we want to\nagree something and to\ndo so in a relatively tight\ntime frame, and we want\nstudents to be treated\nfairly and for as many\nstudents as possible to live\nin halls as a first-year, as\nit's very positive for the\nstudent experience. We\nalso all want the College\nto be financially solvent;\nwe don't want the College's finances to be bad,\nbecause that damages students too. This common\nground, we can use to\nproceed. We won't be\ngiving minute-by-minute\nupdates because it would\nbe unfair on both us and\nCollege, but we really do\nbelieve an agreement can\nbe reached, and if it can\nthen we will be bringing\nthat agreement back to\nUnion Council on January\n21st as a public meeting.\u201d\naccommodation in these\nhalls as returning students\nbecause of their proximity to campus. Students\nasserted that any further\nprice hike would be unjust\nbecause they are not living\nin these halls by choice,\nbut rather because their\nconditions necessitate\nthem to.\nThere was also discussion about how the price\nof rent could be subsidised\nfor Hall Seniors, who\ncurrently take on the role\nentirely on a voluntary\nbasis. This has been in\ndiscussion for a while; in\na session held last year\nby the previous Deputy\nPresident (Welfare) Becky\nNeil, hall seniors were\nasked how the Union and\nCollege could show their\nappreciation for the work\nthat they do, and some of\nthe suggestions included\na 10% rent subsidy. The\nCouncil voted in favour\nof reducing rent for Hall\nSeniors, but with no\nfurther specifics given the\nrejection of the overall\nmodel and the necessity\nfor further negotiation\nwith the College. Also\npassed by Council was a\ndecision to slightly reduce\nthe rent of several rooms\non the Lower Ground\nfloor in Southside and\nEastside, whose windows\nfaced a wall and meant\nthey received extremely\nlimited sunlight.\nAftertheUnionCouncil\nsession ended, Felix and\nICTV interviewed students as well as Council\nrepresentatives about their\nview on the rent increase\nand the breakeven model,\nthe video of which will be\nreleased on Felix\u2019s Facebook page as part of their\n\"Lifting the Rock\" series.\nThere was broad consensus about the importance\nof rent price in choosing\nfirst-year accommodation,\ncorroborating the idea that\nthe North Acton/South\nKensington price gap is a\nfairly sensitive issue that\nthe Union must handle.\nThe Council session itself\nwas live-streamed and the\nfull video can be found on\nthe Union Facebook page.\nThe College did not\naccept a request for\ninterview, but a College\nspokesperson did\ncomment: \u201cwe are continuing our conversations\nwith the Union on a rent\nframework agreement so\nwe can keep providing\nhigh quality and fairly\npriced accommodation for\nour student community.\u201d\n\u201cIt is possible\nthat without\nthe new\nincluded costs,\nrent would not\nhave to rise\u201d\n\u201cWe believe an\nagreement can\nbe reached,\nwhich would\nbe brought\nback to Union\nCouncil on\nJanuary 21st\n\u201d\nWith a 12.2% rent\nhike, the price of living\nin halls is no longer much\ndifferent from the market\nrate of real estate. A single\nroom in Beit, which currently costs \u00a3235/week\nwould be projected to cost\n\u00a3264/week following a\nflat 12.2% increase.\nAlso discussed at\nUnion Council was the\nunfairness of the rent increase for students living\nin Eastside/Southside/\nBeit, not because of\npreference but because\nof health conditions.\nStudents whose physical\nor mental wellbeing\nare unfit are guaranteed\n\n"

Drawing\nparallels with Detroit,\nwhat allowed Berlin to\nbecome the mecca of\nelectronic music was the\npost-industrial landscape\nfollowing the fall of the\niron curtain and German\nreunification. The\npositive energy which accompanied the fall of the\nwall helped propel many\nmovements for equality\nand peace. And whether\nit was love parades or\nprotests against needless\nwars - the anthem of\nthe marching in Berlin\nwas most likely techno.\nThe smooth and coldly\nmelodic sound of German\nelectronic music is one\nof the most vital components of the burgeoning\nscene.\nGetting into Berghain:\nis it worth it or not?\nStanding out in the cold\nfor hours at a time only to\nbe told to get lost with a\nsimple shake of the head?\nGetting intimidated by\nthe mighty shades-at-night-and-white-tuxedo-wearing, face-tattooed\nsnake charmer that is\nSven (Berghain\u2019s inimitable head bouncer)?\nNervously holding your\nbreath as he decides\nwhether you\u2019re worth\nletting in? Many have\ntheir objections.\nThe key to the success\nof Berlin\u2019s clubs is the\natmosphere that rules\ninside them. It is an\nincredible feat that they\nwere able to translate the\nGerman nous for perfection and efficiency into\nsomething as ephemeral\nas clubbing. To sum up,\nI\u2019ll share what a couple\nwho apologetically said\nthey don\u2019t speak German\ngot told by some bouncers\nin Berlin: \u201cStop telling\npeople where you\u2019re\nfrom or who you are.\nNobody gives a fuck.\u201d\nElectronic music is\nfreedom: freedom of ex-perimentation, freedom\nof expression, freedom\nof love. It is the apex on\nthe mountain of proof\nthat there is nothing as\npowerful in this world as\nmusic. In a world where\nlittle makes sense, music\nalways holds the torch \u2013\nmay we march to the beat\nof four to the floor.\nIn the spotlight\nMany will say that the\nbest days of electronic\nmusic are now behind us,\nand that the world is in\nneedofanewandexciting\nform of music. Even\nNina Kraviz, the techno\nqueen herself, has said\nthat the last truly original\nnew genre invented was\ndubstep, and that most of\nmodern house and techno\nis made up of rehashing\nold sounds: nothing truly\nfresh has happened here\nsince times of Chicago\nand Detroit.\nI for one, disagree. The\nmodern day beatmaker\ncan be anyone, and we are\ncurrently experiencing\na revolution of bedroom\nmusicians. Lo-fi house\nespecially has seen a\nwhole everest of musicians flock to Youtube to\nflaunt their compositions\nover some faux-nostalgic\nVHS footage.\nIndeed, it seems\nthat electronic music is\nexperiencing some form\nof revival. It has been\npopping up in mainstream culture with an air\nof reverence, and perhaps\neven a little bit of nos-talgia. Good examples\nof this are Gaspar\nNoe\u2019s film Climax, the\nsoundtrack to which\nwas basically a best-of\nalbum of everything\nfrom very late disco to\nacid house and 90s rave\nand breakbeat. Similarly, Saatchi Gallery, in\nthe heart of London\u2019s\nposhest neighbourhood,\nran an exhibition on rave\nculture this past summer,\nwhich covered the second\nsummer of love in great\ndetail and with heartfelt\nsincerity.\nThese are examples\nthat show that society has\nlargely come to accept\nthat electronic music is\nhere to stay, and has come\nto appreciate the cultural\nsignificance of its roots.\nBesides this, the rise of\nsuperclubs and gigantic\nelectronic music festivals\nhas shown that there is\na wider appreciation for\nthe genre. As always,\nmass commoditisation of\nmusic will have its draw-backs. Some problems\ncurrently plaguing the\nindustry are the skyrocketing DJ fees putting promoters out of business,\nand the rise of megaclubs\noffering lineups which\nrival festivals, which are\ntaking away business\nfrom smaller clubs, and\ntherefore shutting down\nthe stages where the next\nbig thing might have\nannounced themselves.\nWith music becoming\nmore and more accessi-ble, and the digitalisation\nof the world making\nit incredibly facile to\naccess content, it will be\ninteresting to see how\nthis affects electronic\nmusic. There will always\nbe new sounds to explore,\nnew formats to try, and\nnew ways to make people\ndance.\nOne thing is for sure:\nthe story of electronic\nmusic will only keep\ntwisting on and on.\nISSUE 1737\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n57\nThe acid smiley epitomised a whole generation of ravers // Bob Eine\n\u201cElectronic\nmusic is about\nfreedom: of\nexperimenta-tion, of\nexpression,\nand of love\u201d Exit festival is just one example of the many electronic megafestivals in Europe // Wikimedia\n\n"

The set is simple,\nwith a few chairs and\ntables on a patio framed\nby a delicate, lace-like\nframe. As this is the 20s,\na white grand piano is the\ncenterpiece of the scenes.\nPolly Browne (Amara\nOkereke), whose love\nstory with secret Oxford\ndropout Tony (Dylan\nMason) is the main plot of\nthe show, has a beautiful\nvoice which sounds like\nit comes straight from\nan old classic. At times\nshe sounds just like the\nyoung lady who had her\nBroadway debut playing\nthis exact part in 1954\n- you may have heard of\nher: Julie Andrews.\nMaisie (Gabrielle\nLewis-Dodson), Dulcie\n(Annie Southall) and\nFay (Emily Langham)\nplay Polly\u2019s three school\nfriends. For all intents\nand purposes they are\none single character, who\nshare a single brain by the\nsounds of things. Wearing\nsimple 20s dresses that\nlook perfect for a tea\nparty, they moved as one\nin a dramatic and giggly\nway. At times it was like\nwatching an old cartoon\nwith piercingly prim and\nproper accents.\nThe frightfully funny\nand fearlessly french\nHortense (Tiffany Graves)\nstole the show for me.\nShe plays the maid at the\nfinishing school but is\nmuch more of a cool-aunt\nfigure for the english\nroses studying there.\nAs everyone from the\ncomedic timing was impeccable and her radiant\nstage-presence meant you\nwere always drawn to her\neven when the stage got\nbusy.\nAlthough the show\nhas some moments of\nhilarity, drama and joy,\nthe audience is left a bit\nconfused at what exactly\nis being presented. As the\ndramatic storylines get\nresolved in the third act, it\nis unclear if the audience\nwas meant to take them\nseriously all along or\nif the funny situational\ncomedy was the substance\nof the show. The first\nhalf introduced a fun 20s\nsetting and the second\nhalf introduced the comic\ncharacters. However, the\nthird act seemed to pale in\ncomparison as the big ball\nthat everyone had been\nbuilding towards was\nexecuted in a lacklustre\nway. The costumes, which\nup to this point were\nimmaculate, were a bit\ndisappointing here. They\nlooked cheap: a sort of\nbutterfly polyester dress\nand a rushed Aladdin\ncostume needed huge\nimprovement. The show\nhad done such a good job\nkeeping true to its 20s\nroots but this is one place\nwhere it missed the mark.\nDespite the problems in\nthe third part, the show is\nstill a real blast and will\nhave you (attempting)\nthe Charleston all the\nway home. Although the\nchoreography is at times\nquite complex, whether\nthey\u2019re dancing a waltz,\ntap, or even a tango, the\nperformers seemed to be\nhaving lots of fun and it\nis infectious.

So, before you get\nall angry at me for not\nincluding Breaking Bad\nor Westworld on the list,\nit\u2019s only because I didn\u2019t\ninclude anything I haven\u2019t\nseen every episode of. I\ndo seem to be partial to\na good comedy (a fact I\nhadn\u2019t quite realised until\nI had to make this list).\nAnother running theme\nin this list seems to be\nthat all these shows have\nmade me\u2026 feel? Not\nnecessarily feel anything\nin particular\u2026 just, all the\nfeels. Without further ado,\nhere are the shows that I\nreally enjoyed the last ten\nyears.\n1. Schitt\u2019s Creek (2015\n- present)\nMy love for this show\nis something else. I\u2019ll\nadmit that I was late to\nthe party, having started\nto watch the show just as\nits fifth season was about\nto conclude. Now, fully\ncaught up, I am doing a\ncomplete rewatch of the\nseries ahead of its final\nseason, premiering in\nJanuary. Schitt\u2019s Creek is\nperhaps the funniest show\nI\u2019ve ever seen, putting\nits characters through the\nmost ridiculous situations,\nalthough still finding a\nway to remain real and\ngrounded. The first few\nseasons are pure comedy\ngold. However, starting\nwith its second season\nfinale, the show evolves\ninto something so much\nmore, displaying character\ngrowth across the board\nthat is unparalleled. If\nyou\u2019re still not on board,\nplease be my guest and\njump on.\n2. Parks and Recreation (2009-2015)\nParks and Rec is\nprobably the first sitcom\nthat I fell completely in\nlove with. Set in a fictional town in Indiana called\nPawnee, the show focuses\non the employees of the\nParks and Recreation department of the local gov-ernment. Each character\nin Parks and Rec is iconic.\nAs if that\u2019s not enough, it\u2019s\ngiven birth to one of my\nfavourite sayings in the\nentire universe; Treat Yo\u2019\nSelf. Finally, unlike other\nentries on this list, the\nending of the show was\nabsolutely perfect, with\njust enough fan service\nto please the viewers, and\na 100% commitment to\neverything the show has\nbeen over the years.\n3. Fleabag (2016 -2019)\nHaving been born as a\none woman stage show at\nfirst, it\u2019s no surprise that\nits TV show adaptation\nhas become a complete\nhit. Phoebe Waller-Bridge\nnavigates the character\neffortlessly, and explores\nthat it truly means to be\nhuman. It\u2019s a special show.\nEven the funniest jokes\nhas a deeper meaning that\ngives the show its unique\ntone - one which makes\nyou and breaks you at the\nsame time.\n4. Veep (2012 - 2019)\nChronicling the adventures of Selina Meyer,\nthe Vice President of the\nUnited States (VP, Veep\nfor short), the show has\nbeen vastly popular on\nthe other side of the pond.\nAdapted from the British\ncomedy, The Thick of\nIt, Veep is a display of\nthe cutthroat culture in\npolitics. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has pretty much won\nevery single award under\nthe sun for her performance as the fictional vice\npresident, and deservedly\nso. Veep is a show with\nno likeable characters,\nwho are at worst horrible\nhuman beings, and at best,\nabsolutely incompetent.\nAnd it is glorious.\n5. Orange is the New\nBlack (2013 - 2019)\nI always think of\nOrange as the OG Netflix\noriginal show. Although\nthe initial hype around\nthe show died down long\nbefore the series conclud-ed, it has made a mark\nin my brain, mainly for\nits poignant storytelling.\nDespite its occasionally\nannoying characters, the\nshow found a way to keep\ntouching on important,\nextremely relevant issues\nsensitively yet with a\nfirm standpoint. I may not\nalways agree with them,\nbut I commend them for\ndoing and saying things\nmost would be scared to.\n6. The Good Place\n(2016 - present)\nFollowing her untimely\ndeath, Eleanor Shellstrop\nfinds herself at the Good\nPlace (in other words,\nheaven), only to quickly\nrealise that she doesn\u2019t\nbelong there. For the\nmajority of the first\nseason, despite wondering\nwhere they\u2019d take the\nshow, I was convinced\nthat the show would\nremain a simple study\nof what makes humans\ngood or bad. There could\nonly be so much trouble\nin paradise, you know?\n(See what I did there?)\nI was wrong. With what\nI can only describe as a\ngenius twist, the show\nbecame something else.\nAnother shocking twist\nat the end of season two\nalso changed the game for\nthe viewers. Although the\nthird season was slightly\nwonky, it did have some\nof the highest highs of\nthe entire series (Janets,\nanyone?). Set to conclude\nin the next few months,\nThe Good Place has been\na pleasure to watch. Who\ndoesn\u2019t love Kristen Bell\nanyway?\n7. The Crown (2016\n- present)\nI\u2019ve always had a\nmild fascination with\nthe Royals. Turns out,\nso has everyone else,\ngiven the popularity of\nthis show. Now in its\nsecond cast (following the\nconclusion of season 2,\nOlivia Colman and Tobias\nMenzes took over the roles\nfrom Claire Foy and Matt\nSmith to portray older\nversions of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip\nrespectively). Overall, the\nshow is breathtaking and\nelegant. It has some of the\nbest acting on television,\nwith both iterations of the\nRoyal Family delivering\na masterclass in acting. I\nfor one cannot wait to feel\nlike I\u2019m peeking into the\nBuckingham Palace.\n8. Game of Thrones\n(2011 - 2019)\nOn one hand, it hurts\nme to put this show this\nlow on the list, but also\nhurts me to put it this high.\nWhile it was still being\nadapted from books, the\nshow was excellent. Had\nthe quality been kept\nup, it would have easily\ntopped this list. However,\nonce the showrunners surpassed the source material\nat the end of season 5, the\nquality of the show went\ndownhill. The final season\nspecifically was so rushed\nthat it left pretty much\nevery viewer dissatisfied.\nAt its best, though, the\nshow delivered some of\nthe biggest moments of\nTV history. I don\u2019t regret\nwatching it one bit, but\nI regret watching that\nfinale.\n9. Black Mirror (2011 -present)\nThis is a weird one,\nas it doesn\u2019t follow the\nstructure of a conventional show. Each episode is\nindependent of the rest,\nand they all touch on the\nimpact of technology on\npeople\u2019s lives in one way\nor another, mostly leaving\nthe viewers feeling terrified or broken. Its recent,\n\u2018choose-your-own-adventure\u2019-type episode was\npretty much revolution-ary, and honestly quite\nfun. Obviously, some of\nthe stories they opt to tell\nare better than others, but\nwhen it\u2019s good, it tends to\nbe excellent.\n10. The Big Bang Theory (2007 - 2019)\nOne of the longest running sitcoms on American\nTV, The Big Bang Theory is one of the defining shows of the decade,\nproviding n enjoyable\nglimpse into the lives of\na group of scientists As\nthe show started to focus\nmore on relationships and\nto abandon the science\njokes and character build-ing, the quality did suffer\nslightly. However, having\nrecently concluded its\nrun, the ending felt true to\nwhat the show has always\nbeen about. Friendship.\nI didn\u2019t know I could care so deeply about these Schitt\u2019s Creek characters... and\ndeeply flawed ones at best // Pop TV\nTELEVISION\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019 FELIX\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n38\n\n"

    "content": "The Do\u2019s and Don\u2019t of a Student Christmas Dinner:\nTHE BIRD\nFOOD\nSyon Lee\nZahra Abiola\nFood Editors\nA whole roast turkey\nis the usual fare for a\nChristmas dinner but\nunless you are ready\nto buy way ahead,\nhave an inordinate\namount of oven space,\nand you don\u2019t mind\nthe lengthy brining\nand cooking process,\nI would steer clear. A\npoorly cooked turkey\nis way worse than no\nturkey at all. Similarly,\nother large birds like\ngeese may be beyond\nthe capabilities of a\nnovice student chef.\nChicken is a safe\nchoice, its relatively\nbland flesh a good\nblank canvas for any\nspice rubs or seasoning mix you want to\nemploy. For larger\nbirds, consider cooking it spatchcock. By\nremoving the backbone and squashing\nthe bird flat, you can\nseason more of its\nsurface and reduce\nthe cooking time!\nDuck is a good substitute for chicken if you\nwant to go up a level\nin terms of flavour.\nIf you\u2019re cooking for\na crowd, small birds\nsuch as poussin or\nguinea fowl may be\npreferred and can be\neasily sourced from\nDeck your halls with boughs of holly because Christmas is fast approaching! As everyone\nknows, the true meaning of Christmas is gorging yourself into a calorie-induced coma.\nUnfortunately,facedwithastudentbudgetandlimitationsofhalls-basedkitchenapparatus,\nrecreatingthisfestivemomentcanseemadauntingtask.WellFelixisheretosaveyourbacon\n(or facon) and equip you with the principles of a perfect Christmas dinner.\nsupermarkets. Not only\ndo they cook quicker\nand give you time to\nfocus on other parts of\nthe meal, they\u2019re also\neasier to split than carving your way through\na single large bird and\ntrying to divide up the\nspoils evenly.\nSeasoning and flavouring is up to you. A simple rub-down with olive\noil, salt, and pepper\nbefore cooking will suffice for most but if you\nwant to ensure loads\nof flavour and plenty\nof crispy skin, I recommend a dry brine.\nDry brining is basically\nsalting the meat in advance to impart flavour\nand draw out some\nmoisture. Rubbing the\nbird all over with salt\nand some sugar before\nplacing in the fridge\n(overnight for a large\nbird or a few hours for\nsmaller birds) can make\na world of a difference\nin the finished prod-uct. Before roasting,\njust rub some butter,\nthyme, and crushed\ngarlic and you\u2019re all set\nto go.\nIn terms of actually\ncooking your bird,\nthe instructions on\nthe packaging will do\na pretty good job in\ntelling you how long\nthe meat should take\nto cook. Obviously,\na food thermometer\nwould be handy in\nmaking sure you have\na perfectly cooked bird\nall the way through but\nsimple tricks like stabbing to the bone and\nwatching to make sure\nthe juice runs perfectly clear will work for\nmost cases. And if the\nmeat is unfortunately\nstill pink in the middle\nafter carving, you can\nalways just return it\nto the oven for another half hour or (in a\npinch), pop it in the\nmicrowave.\nNON-BIRD CENTREPEICE\nI have to confess at\nthis stage that I don\u2019t\nbelieve in Christmas\ndinners without a bird\nat the centre. But for\nthe ornithophobes\nout there, we have a\ncouple of options. A\nwhole roast ham can\nbe a good shout but a\ngood cured, smoked\nbone-in ham can be\ndifficult to find at the\nbest of times. To be\nhonest, any roast meat\nwill do but I find that\nbeef is too fiddly for an\nalready stressful ven-ture. If you\u2019re up for\nthe challenge, a rack of\nribs (beef or lamb), are\na fancy and relatively\ninexpensive addition to\nthe table.\nFor the vegetarians, the\nmuch-maligned nut\nroast is an option for\nsure (check out Felicity Cloake\u2019s Guardian\narticle, How to cook the\nperfect nut roast) but\nthere are definitely better options out there.\nWhile a mushroom\nwellington or similar\nvegetables-in-pastry are\na delicious treat, making one from scratch\ncan be difficult and\nultimately risky (pastry\nmay fail, vegetables may\nrelease too much steam\nor stay undercooked).\nA simple alternative\nis a roast gourd like\na lovely stuffed and\nroasted butternut\nsquash. Easy to do with\nminimal prep, a drizzle\nof olive oil and some\nseasoning along with\na healthy topping of\nquinoa, pine nuts, and\npeppers may be all you\nneed to make a beautiful rainbow-coloured\nmain.\nPOTATOES\nThe only acceptable\nform of starch for this\ndinner is potato. And\na good roast potato is\nimportant to master\nfor any other roast\ndinners you may want\nto make going forward.\nThe potato choice is\nimportant as you want\nsomething nice and\nstarchy to crisp in the\noven. You\u2019ll see all\nsorts of potato varieties\nmentioned online but\nfaced with a Sainsbury\u2019s Local, you\u2019re\nnot likely to be faced\nwith an overwhelming\namount of choice. For\nyour purposes, anything that isn\u2019t a new\npotato or salad potato\nwill serve you well. Just\nremember to give the\npotatoes a good shake\nin a colander after parboiling to give you the\nrough edges for browning in the oven.\nMashed potato is also\na good choice, especially with limited oven\nspace. You can play\naround with textures by\nadjusting the amount\nof milk or cream you\nadd. Just remember to\nsalt liberally and use\nan excess of butter. Top\nwith some parsley to\nadd some colour to the\ndish.\n// Pixabay\n// Pixabay\n// Pixabay\nFOOD\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019 FELIX\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n78\n\n"

    "content": "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Seasons 1 and 2)\nBefore another binge session of the newly released Season 3, let\u2019s take a walk down memory lane recapping the\nfirst two seasons\nA\nmazon Prime\nVideo\u2019s The\nM a r v e l o u s\nMrs. Maisel is\na period comedy-drama\nset in 1958 Manhattan,\nNew York. It follows\nthe self-discovery\njourney of Mrs. Miriam\n\u201cMidge\u201d Maisel, a house-wife-turned-stand-up-co-median. It\u2019s created by\nAmy Sherman-Palladino\nwho is best known for\ncreating the cult classic\nGilmore Girls. Since its\ninitial release in 2017, the\nshow has been well-re-ceived, most notably\nearning 34 Emmy nominations and winning 16.\nBelieve me, it\u2019s definitely\nworth every hype.\nThe premise begins\nwith Mrs. Maisel (played\nby Rachel Brosnahan),\nan upper-class Jewish\nAmerican housewife\nwhose husband has an\naffair with his secretary\nand leaves her, and\nfrom there unexpectedly\nstumbles upon a career\nin stand-up comedy. The\nstory plays out as Mrs.\nMaisel faces immense\npressure from her family\nto return to the so-called\nregular life all whilst\nshe shows herself in a\nmale-dominated industry.\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of\nelements but the few that\nit has are fleshed out well\nto always keep the plot interesting enough to move\nforward, coupled with\nabsolutely delightful characters delivering witty\nline after line. There\u2019s\nalways something to look\nforward to in the story, but\nthe highlight of the show\nhas to be the characters.\nThe character of\n\u201cMidge\u201d is an interesting\none - it\u2019s so natural to fit\nevery expectation of an\nelegant 50\u2019s lady without\nbeing overly stereotypi-cal. She is likable from the\nvery beginning - smart,\nchatty, graceful, and\nunbelievably hilarious.\nSherman-Palladino\u2019s\nsharp writing has molded\na multidimensional\ncharacter with incredible\none-liners, and Brosnahan\u2019s superb acting brings\nthis character to life. I\nespecially love how the\ntheme of feminism is\nexplored through the lens\nof Mrs. Maisel, where\nshe seeks feminism not\n\u201cSocial\nmovement\nfueled by\nsimple\neveryday\nmatter\u201d\nfor the sake of it but is\nrather motivated by her\npassions. This perfectly\ncaptures the essence of\nthe awakening social\nmovement fueled not by\nsudden revelations but\nsimple everyday matter.\nThe supporting cast\nalso shapes this show in\nmany ways - I love how\neach and every single\none of them is portrayed.\nFirst I was beyond thrilled\nwhen I saw Lenny Bruce\n(played by Luke Kirby)\nappearing in the first\nepisode. If you didn\u2019t\nknow, Bruce is a well-known stand-up comedian\nof the time in real life. In\nthe show, Bruce serves as\na friend and champion of\nMidge. I can understand\nwhy Sherman-Palladino\ncould not resist incorporating such a character\n- and I\u2019m all for it. Second\nof all Susie Myerson\n(played by Alex Borstein)\nis Midge\u2019s manager;\nevery scene with both of\nthem is a definite laugh-out-loud. Midge\u2019s family\n- her husband Joel (played\nby Michael Zegen), Rose\nWeissman (played by\nMarin Hinkle), and Abe\nWeissman (played by\nTony Shalhoub) all are\nsuch fun and characteristic roles that helps build\na necessary layer to the\nshow.\nAnother favourite\ntheme of mine explored\nin The Marvelous Mrs.\nMaisel is the idea of\n\u201ctragedy fuels comedy,\u201d\nwhich I feel like we have\nall known all along but no\none really points it out.\nMidge\u2019s monologue hits\nso close to heart and best\nsummarises the rising\ngenre of tragicomedy,\n\u201cComedy is fueled by\noppression, by the lack\nof power, by sadness and\ndisappointment, by abandonment and humiliation.\nNow, who the hell does\nthat describe more than\nwomen? Judging by those\nstandards, only women\nshould be funny.\u201d This\nis also exemplified by\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s\nFleabag.\nLast but not least, we\ncannot have a review\nof this show without\nshedding light on its\noutstanding costume\ndesign. Let\u2019s have a\nround of applause for\nthe costume designer\nDonna Zakowska, who\ntook the extra mile and\ncustom-made all of the\ncostumes to stay true to\nthe 50\u2019s fashion.

    "content": "ISSUE 1737\nFELIX\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n35\nKnives Out (2019)\nI\nt\u2019s not often that a\nfilm starts getting\nalmost unanimous\npraise from critics, so\nwhen this murder mystery\nfrom Rian Johnson started\nto garner attention from\nalmost every direction, it\nleft me wondering: what\nmakes this film so good?\nIt centres around\nthe family of Harlan\nThrombey, a wealthy\ncrime novelist, who is\nfound having slit his own\nthroat the morning after\nhis 85th birthday. Benoit\nBlanc (Daniel Craig) is\nhired anonymously to try\nto uncover whether it was\ntruly a suicide, or whether\nthere was \u201cfoul play\u201d\n(which I can tell you,\nthere is).\nKnives Out is definitely\na traditional \u2018whodunit\u2019\nfilm, but also, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s\ntraditional in the sense that\nit follows a familiar struc-ture, yet manages to avoid\nall tropes of those lesser\nthat have come before it.\nWith a devilishly clever\nand witty script, Johnson\nhas managed to sidestep\nthe sombre atmosphere,\nall whilst maintaining this\nhigh level of suspense.\nWhere other films may\nhave lingered with a\nserious tone, Knives Out\npropels itself forward\nwith moments of levity\nthat brighten each scene,\nwhilst the suspense keeps\nyou hooked; not to give\nany spoilers, but this plot\nwould really make Agatha\nChristie proud.\nWhere this film also\nsets itself apart from\na plethora of others is\nthe social commentary\nrunning throughout:\nHarlan Thrombey\u2019s death\nwill mean the inheritance\nof his significant fortune\nto his family members,\nbut who will be getting\nwhat? Taking aim at the\nupper-class elite with\nthemes of inherited\nwealth, nepotism, and\nstrong right-wing views,\nJohnson pokes fun at\nthe wealthy, littering the\nscript with sharp digs\nand excellent plot details\nhighlighting many of the\nobscene, eccentric characteristics of the elite. This\nis all presented in a very\nself-aware fashion, simply\nadding to the enjoyment\nand wit of the script.\nComing onto the\ncinematography, Johnson\nclearly has an eye for what\nhe\u2019s doing. With many\nlow angles, close ups, and\npanning shots, Knives Out\ndefinitely doesn\u2019t miss\na beat when it comes to\nhow they affect the scene.\nThese are testament to\nhow effective it can be\nfor the writer to be the\ndirector, with each scene\nput together perfectly and\noften adding details that\nmay have gone askew\notherwise.\nAs a final mention, the\nwhole film is tied together\nperfectly by an excellent (and star-studded)\nensemble cast. With Craig\nat the helm, donning such\nan expertly done southern\nAmerican accent that you\nalmost forget he\u2019s from\nChester, we\u2019re taken\ninto the world of Benoit\nBlanc, yet forbidden to\nsee the inner workings of\nhis mind. However, the\nmost inspired actress of\nthis film is the perfectly\ncast lead, Ana de Armas,\nwho\u2019s performance as\nthe kind-hearted Marta\nCabreras couldn\u2019t have\nbeen more engaging and\ntruer to the character.\nIf you\u2019re looking for\nfeel-good film that goes\nbeyond the shallow\ndepths of many that seek\nto provide such levity,\nKnives Out is the perfect\nfilm to put you on the edge\nof your seat, and then\nknock you back into it\nwith a barrage of wit and\nsuspense to keep anyone\nthoroughly entertained\nuntil the very end.\nThe Third Man (1949): A Look at the Film Turning 70\nL\nooking back at\nthis aged and distant film allows\nyou to visualise\nthe significant amount of\ntime that has passed since\nFelix was established in\n1949, and also gives some\nrelevant perspective in\nthe advances cinema has\nmade. Written by Graham\nGreene, the film centres\naround Holly Martins\n(Joseph Cotton) following\nhis pursuit of the truth\nin finding the nature of\nHarry Lime\u2019s (Orson\nWelles) death.\nFor the first half of\nthis film we\u2019re thrust into\nthe unknown, with our\nperspective being entirely\nthat of Martins\u2019. We\u2019re\nleft to unpack the details\nof the events preceding his\narrival in Vienna as we\u2019re\ntrying to paint a picture of\nwhat\u2019s happened up to this\npoint with Martins being\ndrawn to Lime\u2019s lover\nAnna Schmidt (Alida\nValli).\nAbout one hour in,\nwe\u2019re treated to one of\nthe most iconic entrances\nof any character in the\nhistory of cinema: a shrill\nof a cat, a flash of light in\nthe doorway, and Orson\nWelles introduces himself\ninto this film as Lime,\ngrabbing our attention\nimmediately.

    "content": "War Horse: A Year Later\nHunger-thebattlebetween\nthe self and the city\nARTS\nOzbil Ege Dumenci\nArts Editor\nL\nast year, I was\nlucky enough to\nwatch War Horse\nat the National\nTheatre, its return to the\noriginal National Theatre\nvenue a celebration of the\ncentenary of Armistice\nDay.I loved it so much the\nfirst time that I grabbed a\ndifferent friend the next\nevening and ended up\nqueueing for return tickets\nto watch it again.\nJust about a year\nlater, the play returned\nto London once again,\nthis time playing at the\nWembley Troubadour\nTheatre before embarking\non a year-long international tour, heading to France,\nAustralia and Singapore.\nObviously, I had to go\nwatch War Horse once\nagain. Having convinced\na rather hesitant pair of\nfriends to tag along, we\nmade our way to Wembley\nand left feeling that not\nonly was the commute\nfully worth it, but that\nwe\u2019d be more than happy\nto travel further to witness\nthe marvel of War Horse.\nIn fact, as I\u2019m writing\nthis, one of my friends is\nalready making plans to\nreturn before the show\ncloses.\nThe story, adapted from\nMichael Morpurgo\u2019s best-by a group of incredibly\ntalented puppeteers, are\nso well-executed that\nthe first time I saw the\nplay, I started sobbing\nthe moment the horses\nshowed up.\nWar Horse has\neverything that makes a\nplay great. It is innova-tive, thought provoking,\nrelevantandjustallaround\nexcellent.Audiences of all\nages can find something\nto take away from it about\nhumanity and the importance of love and compassion towards humans and\nanimals alike. One just\nhas to be heartless for the\nplay to not strike a chord.\nMy feelings towards\nWar Horse have not\nchanged within the last\nyear, despite the change\nin location and the cast.\nWhen people hear how\nfrequently I go to the\ntheatre, their first question\nis almost always \u2018What\u2019s\nyour favourite play of all\ntime?\u2019. Not only is the\nanswer clear, but even\nmore so than before now\nthat I\u2019ve had the chance\nto relive the marvel that is\nWar Horse.\nS\nimply titled\n\u201cHunger\u201d, director Fay Lomas\ndelves into the\npsychological turmoil\nas this primal instinct\ncomes face-to-face with\nambition. What sacrifices\nare we willing to make\nfor our dreams? Although\nthe production is based on\nthe 1890 novel written by\nmodernist Knut Hamsun,\nit displays a shocking\nrelevance to the present.\nWhat unfolds in this\nintimate studio is a story\nthat cuts at the heart and\nmind of an aspiring writer\nin his struggle to succeed.\nIt becomes clear that\nthis nameless writer is\nnot limited by his talent,\nrather by the resounding\nrejection from the bustling\nmetropolis. One by one,\nhis friendships, career,\nand grasp of reality begin\nto crumble as Hunger\ntakes over.\nThe writer\u2019s desire to\nflourish is a craving to\nwhich we can all relate.\nWhen we hear accounts\nof the painful climb to\nsuccess, it can easily go\nover our heads as those\nexperiences are often\nbrief and irrefutably\none-in-a-million. As the\nstory enters its second\nhalf, the city itself grows\na character: an unforgiv-ing, hungry predator that\nbegins to swallow the\nfailing writer whole.\nKwami Odoom as the\nprotagonist shines with\nan earnest energy. He\nportrays a driven albeit\nna\u00efve individual at the\ncusp of his dreams, whose\nsense of self gradually\nunravels. As we watch\nthis happen, we realise the\nextent of which we depend\non our career for purpose.\nFor the most part, the performance is mesmerising.\nHowever, the downwards\nspiral to insanity is highly\nabstract. Portraying this\nin theatre is bold, and\nthere are moments which\nsimply do not work and\nsometimes detach you\nfrom the scene.\nWithout prior knowledge to the original text,\nthe ending can come\nacross as abrupt and unex-pected. But the rest of the\nperformance is so well rehearsed and precise that it\nis as much a choreography\nas it is a play. It is a real\npleasure to watch each\nstep of the four actors as\ndeliberate as the last.\nThis production is a\nruthless, finely tuned tale\nof the harsh reality of\npursuing a pipe dream.\nSmall productions such as\nthese have the freedom to\nstay faithful to the source\ntext, and it is shameful\nhow much it still rings\ntrue. Knut Hamsun in\nthis modern age would be\ndisgraced for his perverse\nviews on race and politics.\nDespite this, \u201cHunger\u201d\nremains powerfully\nrelevant and thought-pro-voking, and an especially\nimportant tale for any\naspiring student.\nThe writer explores the depths of our most primal need, hunger // Alex Brenner\nI will never be not blown away by the puppetry in War Horse // Brinkhoff/M\u00f6genburg\nISSUE 1737\nFELIX\n29\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nByron Gamble\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Laura Casas attempts to unravel this conundrum...\nART\nLaura Casas\nArts Writer\nV\nan Gogh, while\nalive (1853-1890), only\nsold one paint-ing. Though we all agree\nthat The Starry Night\n(1889) and Sunflowers\n(1888) are artworks,\npeople of the time detested or at least ignored these\ncanvases. Thus, was it not\nart then and it is now?\nWas it always art?\nIn contrast, other\nmasterpieces were acclaimed by public and\ncritic from the very first\nmoment. The Persistence\nof Memory by Salvador\nDal\u00ed, a meaningful work\nof Surrealism, was taken\nto the MoMa shortly\nafter being painted. Pride\nand Prejudice received\nwonderful, favorable\nreviews referring to Jane\nAusten as \u201cthe professional woman writer\u201d.\nThe Pieta was enthusiastically acclaimed from\nthe beginning, launching\nMichelangelo\u2019s dazzling\ncareer.On the other hand,\nVan Gogh\u2019s case of\nposthumous success is\nnot unique. Many other\npainters, like Monet and\nthe impressionists, had\nsimilar problems. The\nRite of Spring\u2019s premiere\n(Igor Stravisnski, 1913)\nwas a dramatic fiasco.\nMozart died in poverty,\nwithout receiving his\npresent recognition. The\nGirl with a Pearl Earring\nby Vermeer was sold for\nthe current equivalent of\n\u20ac24 .\nThese examples lead\nus to the question that\nentitles the article: Is it\nart if everybody hates it?\nAccording to The Oxford\nDictionary, \u2018art\u2019is \u2018the expression or application of\nhuman creative skill and\nimagination producing\nworks to be appreciated\nprimarily for their beauty\nor emotional power\u2019. This\ncould make one wonder if\nhating a piece means it has\nan emotional power over\nthem, after all. Certainly,\na work can make you feel\nuncomfortable or even\nangry, like the very disturbing Collective Invention by Rene Magritte or\nSaturn Devouring His Son\nby Francisco de Goya; but\nfor the sake of this article\nwe have referred to hating\na work as to loathing it for\nits absence of worth.\nThe above definition\nis not objective, for\nthe meaning of beauty\nor emotional power is\ndifferent depending on\nthe person who judges.\nNot everyone is moved\nby the same pieces. Even\nwithin the most cultured,\n\u201cGiven that\nart is very\nsubjective,\nthe fate of a\nwork depends\non the\ncollaboration\nof spectators\u201d\n\u201cGiving a\nrandom\npineapple\nart status\nseems rather\nridiculous.\u201d\nrenowned, and sensitive\ncelebrities there have\nbeen different criteria.\nThe cubist movement\nwas extremely criticised\nby figures such as Gino\nSeverini while others, like\nGuillaume Apollinaire\nand Marx Jacob, defended\nit fiercely. However,\nthere are works that are\nunanimously acclaimed as\nmasterpieces. Therefore,\nit is tempting to say that\na piece is art if there is\nenough consensus from\na majority of people who\nfeel that their \u201cbeauty\u201d\nor \u201cemotional power\u201d\nis intense and profound.\nAlthough, admittedly, this\nidea is somewhat vague,\ntaking it as an alternative\ndefinition of art, the\nanswer to the question \u201cis\nit art if everybody hates\nit?\u201d would be \u201cno\u201d, given\nthe lack of consensus\nabout its value.\nAnyhow, this is not a\nsatisfactory conclusion\nfor it does not shed any\nlight on episodes like Van\nGogh\u2019s. Given that art is\nvery subjective, the fate\nof a work depends on the\ncollaboration of the spec-tators. If they don\u2019t have\nenough tact and receptiv-ity, a marvel could pass\nunnoticed. Cultivating the\nsensitivity of the observer\nis key for the work to be\nproperly appreciated.\nThis is why time plays\nan essential role in this\ndiscussion. Continuing\nwith Van Gogh\u2019s example,\n19th century education\nwas much poorer than the\ncurrent one, thus people\nwere not exposed to\nartisticformsasmuch.The\nsociety was less prepared\nto evaluate potential art.\nThis also explains why\nthe very innovative works\nwere often unsuccessful:\nthere was hardly anyone\nwith the right sensibility\nto enjoy them.\nLet us now explore\na complementary point\nof view to the original\nidea: would having a\nsingle person like it be\na sufficient condition to\ncall it art? Accepting such\npremise can create rather\ninteresting situations.\nOne of various examples\nis the pineapple incident\nthat took place in an art\ngallery in Aberdeen,\nScotland in 2017. The\none-pound-pineapple\nwhich a student left as a\nprank on an empty stand\nbecame a masterpiece\nwhen employees protected it with a glass display\ncase. Some claimed to understand the meaning of\nthis supposed work of art.\nA theory jotted down by\nthe New York Times was\nthat \u201cthe pineapple symbolized the U.K. leaving\nthe E.U., standing alone,\nattempting to survive,\ncut off from the outside\nworld\u201d. As evidenced, this\ntropical fruit seemed to\nhave been liked by some.\nErgo, by this logic, the\npineapple would be art.\nGiving a random\npineapple art status seems\nrather ridiculous. One\nmistake of this reasoning\nis that liking a piece does\nnot imply by itself that it\nhas emotional power, e.g.\na good sewage system.\nSimilarly, admiring a\nwork by its technical difficulty (without this being\nthe case of the pineapple)\nis not synonym of feeling\nits beauty. We can enjoy\nhow an extremely difficult\nviolin piece is played\nby a virtuoso. However,\nthis does not endow the\npiece or the performance\nwith artistic value, unless\nwe have been touched\nby it. As can be inferred\nby its definition, art is\nnot something that you\nevaluate, but something\nthat you feel. Vanessa\nMarianna from Daredevil\n(TV) explains this idea\nwhen, referring to a white\npainting, she tells Wilson\nFisk that \u201cit\u2019s not about\nthe artist\u2019s name or the\nskill required (...) All that\nmatters is, how does it\nmake you feel?\u201d\nLet us conclude trying\nto answer to the initial\nquestion: Is it art if everybody hates it? The answer\nis \u201cno\u201d given the absolute\nlack of consensus about\nits value. But it would be\nmore cautious to answer\n\u201cnot yet\u201d, leaving a door\nopen to a future recognition (which of course\nmay not always come). If\nsomebody is touched by a\nwork, which is however\nhated by most, they can\nlegitimately feel that it is\na work of art, given the\nsubjectivity inherent in\nthe artistic appreciation,\nand hope that time will\nprove them right.\nDoes the pineapple have innate artistic value? // Ruairi Gray, Twitter\nFELIX\nMONDAY. 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019\n32\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

What\nmust she do to bring herself the happiness that she\nso effortlessly provides\nthose around her?\nCharming is the only\nword I can think of that\nsufficiently describes\nAmelie. The relatively\nsmall stage and auditorium of The Other\nPalace greatly contribute\nto the cosy feel of the\nproduction, which makes\nit perfect for a date. The\ncouple sitting in front\nof me would probably\nagree, as they partook in\nan endless round of tonsil\ntennis throughout.\nThe only downside of\nthe small stage size is that,\nat times, it felt overcrowd-ed, especially due to the\nactor/muso approach - the\ncast members themselves\nwere the ones playing\nthe instruments on stage.\nHowever, this was rarely\nan issue, and I strongly\nbelieve that the small\nstage size helped give the\nproduction an intimate\nfeel more than it hurt it.\nThere were some relatively odd choices sprinkled\nthroughout the show,\nsuch as using the death of\nPrincess Diana as a timeframe reference, and as\njustification for Amelie\u2019s\nactions. However, the\noddest moment of the\nproduction was a dream\nsequence involving \u2018Elton\nJohn\u2019 serenading the lead\ncharacter, complete with\nweird pop culture references (such as Oprah\u2019s\nfamous \u2018you get a car\u2019\nspeech).

I\nwas hoping that the show\nwould have borrowed\nsome elements from the\niconic score by Yann\nTiersen, which brilliantly\ncaptures the charm and\nthe melancholy of the\ncharacter. This unfortunately wasn\u2019t the case.\nHowever, the music was\nstrong enough to stand on\nits own two feet, having a\ndistinct Parisian feel.\nThe overall cast was\nexceptional, with Audrey\nBrisson providing an\nunbelievable vocal and\ntheatrical performance\nas the titular character.\nHer voice had a magical,\nunique quality that feels\nas true to the character\nas one could imagine or\nhope for. Likewise, Chris\nJared proved to be an\nexcellent choice for Nino,\nthe mystical yet endearing\npotential love interest for\nAmelie.\nHaving opened on\nBroadway in 2017,\nclosing a mere two\nmonths later despite the\nundeniable star power for\nPhilippa Soo (her first role\nsince leaving the cast of\nHamilton), I was curious\nto find out two things: why\nthe Broadway production\nended so prematurely,\nand why such a failure\nwould be brought to the\nLondon stage. Being the\ninvestigative journalist\nthat I am, I quickly found\nout that the main issue\nwith the Broadway production was the complete\nloss of its original charm\nand Parisian feel. This is\nabundantly clear from the\nOriginal Cast Recording\nas well, which sounds\nlike... well... every other\nshow on Broadway...\nI am extremely happy\nto report that this issue has\nbeen completely resolved\nfor the UK production as\nthis is no direct import\nfrom Broadway, but a\nre-imagination of the\nsource material, and a\ncomplete return to form.\nThis is a completely new\nshow, complete with a\nnew director, new staging\nand new musical arrangements (complete with\naccordions), which brings\nback the Parisian feel to\nthe show that it desperately seems to have been\nmissing in New York.\nCharming.

He\nwas killed in a police raid\nwith the assent of local\nlaw enforcement, the state\ngovernment\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office, and the FBI.\nHe was 21 years old.\nHampton was a\nmember of the Black\nPanther Party. Established in 1966, the Black\nPanthers were founded\nas a reaction against\nracist police brutality,\nwith the core practice of\n\u201ccopwatching\u201d, where\nthey formed an armed\ncitizens patrol to protect\neach other from the police\nand monitor police action.\nThisweekmarksthe50thanniversaryoftheassassinationofFredHampton.UnionPresidentAbhijaySoodreflects\non Hampton\u2019s influence as a young radical and lessons we can learn from him today.\nFred Hampton // Jacob Anikulapo, Flickr\nFELIX\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cEmphasising\nthat class\nsolidarity\nwould be\nthe key to\nlift people\nfrom poverty,\nwhereas racial\ndivisions\nwould only\nmaintain\nthem\u201d\nat a time when the government was doing little\nto economically empower\nblack communities, with\nsocial programs including\nfree breakfasts for poor\nchildren, after-school\nprograms, and community\nhealth clinics.\nHampton joined the\nPanthers in Chicago in\nlate 1968. He was instrumental in significantly\nexpanding the party\u2019s\nmembership; he organised\nweekly rallies, taught\nregular political education\nclasses, and contributed\nmuch to copwatching and\nfree breakfast programs.\nPerhaps most significant-ly, he brought Chicago\nstreet gangs together to\nform a non-aggression\npact, emphasising that\nclass solidarity would be\nthe key to lift people from\npoverty, whereas racial\ndivisions would only\nmaintain them. He eventually became the chairman\nof the Illinois chapter and\ndeputy chairman of the\nentire Party.\nThis organising, and his\nskills as an orator, made\nHampton a threat to entrenched power; J. Edgar\nHoover, 1st director of the\nFBI and inveterate racist,\nregarded him as an enemy\nagitator, and had him\nsurveilled. At the same\ntime, the FBI fomented\nmistrust among disparate\nmembers of Hampton\u2019s\n\u201crainbow coalition\u201d (the\nmulticultural political\ngroup), sparking violence\nand fracturing among\nthe different groups he\u2019d\nbrought together. Eventually, they blackmailed\na convicted criminal,\nWilliam O\u2019Neal, into\ninfiltrating the Chicago\nPanthers, who supplied\nthem with the intelligence\nin advance of the fatal\nraid.\nHampton was drugged\nby O\u2019Neal on the evening\nof December 3rd, and was\nthus unable to react when\nlaw enforcement stormed\nthe building he was in,\nmurdered one of his asso-ciates, wounded him and\nthen shot him twice more\nfor good measure. His\npartner, heavily pregnant,\nhad been sleeping next\nto him and was forcibly\nremoved from the room\nbefore his death.\nI wanted to write about\nchange that huge government agencies determined\nhe was a threat worthy\nof elimination. Through\ntenacity and strength of\nwill, Hampton changed\nthe equation of black lib-ertation and social change\nin Chicago. In doing\nso, he made enemies,\njust as Martin Luther\nKing, Thomas Sankara,\nMahatma Gandhi and so\nmany others did. Change\nthreatens people in power.\nAnd though the reaction\nagainst the Panthers eventually led to their disintegration in the 70s, their\nefforts resulted in black\nAmericans gaining a lot\nof ground on civil rights,\nand shined a spotlight on\nvarious social issues that\nhad been hitherto ignored.\nWhile the personalities\nof individual leaders do\nprovide focal points for\nmovements, the strength\nof these movements is\nreally in numbers.\nIn my mind, the most\nsignificant lesson we can\nlearn from Hampton\u2019s\nstory is that, if they could\nachieve so much in the\nface of poverty and perse-cution, we should be able\nto do even more from our\nposition of relative privi-lege. The injustices and\nissues we face now are\nno less pressing than they\nwere then \u2013 economic in-justice, climate injustice,\nracial injustice. If they\ncould act then, we have no\nexcuse to fail to act now.\nIn Hampton\u2019s words:\n\u201cif you dare to struggle\nyou dare to win, if you\ndare not struggle, then\ndamn it, you don\u2019t deserve\nto win.\u201d\nthis story for two reasons.\nFirst, I think it\u2019s important that we understand\nthat no matter where in\nthe world you might be,\npeople with power are\ncapable of abusing it, and\nthat the government and\nlaw enforcement don\u2019t\nnecessarily have your best\ninterests at heart.\nSecond, I think there\u2019s\nsomething we can draw\nfrom Hampton\u2019s story,\nand the positive albeit\nshort-lived impact he was\nable to have in his commu-nity. To me, it\u2019s amazing a\n21-year old could become\na focal point for organising significant enough\n\u201cHis\norganizational\nrole in Black\nPanther, and\nhis skills as an\norator, made\nhim a threat\nto entrenched\npower\u201d\nThey cited the law as a\ndefence when challenged,\neventually precipitating\nstrict gun control laws,\nincluding in California\nwhere the legislation\npassed was supported by\nthen governor Ronald\nReagan. The Black\nPanthers also organised\nsupport for black citizens\n14\n\n"

    "content": "Troy: Myth and Reality\nL\negend has it that\nthe goddess of\ndiscord threw\na golden apple\ninto a crowd, bearing\nthe inscription \u2018for the\nmost beautiful\u2019. It was\nclaimed by three god-desses, Athena, Hera and\nAphrodite, and Zeus asked\nThe Trojan prince Paris to\nmake the final judgement.\nHe chose Aphrodite, who\npromised him the most\nbeautiful woman in the\nworld. This woman was\nHelen, wife of the Greek\nking Menelaus. who Paris\nstole away from Greece\nand across the sea beginning the siege of Troy.\nDuring the war, atrocities\nwere committed on both\nsides but ultimately, the\nGreeks conquered the\ngreat city of Troy with the\ncunning use of the Trojan\nhorse and the ferocity of\nthe hero, Achilles.\nThe myth of the Trojan\nwar has been told for over\n3000 years and continues\nto inspire people today. It\nwas first told by word-of-mouth, then immortalised\nin Virgil\u2019s Aeneid as well\nas Homer\u2019s epic poems,\nthe Iliad and the Odyssey.\nNow, it is told through\nplays, operas, film and\nTroy: Myth and Reality.\nThe exhibition at the\nBritish Museum focuses\nnot only on the history of\nthe myth but explores the\nstory in a rich and conclusive study. Patrons are\nfirst invited to question\nwhether Helen loved Paris\nor was merely a captive.\nThere are different interpretations in art and the\ninfluence of the Gods is\ncentral to this, with many\nversions of the story\ndepicting Paris and Helen\nas pawns in Zeus\u2019 plans.\nA large space is dedicated\nto Achilles as both a\ncourageous war hero and\na monster, murdering and\ndefiling his enemies. The\nfall of Troy is particularly\ninteresting with its depictions of the Trojan horse\nand the tale of Aeneas,\nwho escapes the burning\nTroy to later become the\nfounder of Rome. The\nexhibition goes as far as to\ncover the aftermath of the\nwar, including the travels\nof Odysseus and his return\nto his wife, Penelope. In\nthis section, attention is\ndrawn to the fantastical\nbeasts featured in Homer\u2019s\nworks; the sirens and sea\nmonsters are shown in\nworks from the time but\nalso in popular culture\nfrom more modern origin,\nrevealing a fascination of\nGreek myth to this day.\nWe also learn of the archaeological discoveries\nmade around Troy and\ntouchingly, parallels are\nmade between the Trojan\nwar and modern war and\ncrisis.\nThe collection is impressive in both quality\nand quantity, showcasing\nstunning marble sculp-tures, engravings, paint-ings, pottery and original\nitems from \u2018Priam\u2019s\ntreasure\u2019. However, due\nto the limited exhibition\nspace and intense popular-ity, the exhibit can become\nvery crowded. I found that\nI had to essentially fight\nmy way to read exhibit\ncaptions, which were\npoorly placed at ground\nlevel. Although the visit\nmay be slow-going, this\ndoes not detract massively\nfrom the installation and\nit was worth attending to\nwitness the reconstruction\nofAchilles\u2019shield, ancient\ntranscripts of the Iliad and\nfar more.\nThe Wind of Heaven: From Bethlehem to Blestin\nT\nhe greatest objection to God\nhas always been\nemotional. While\nit is true that the debate\nover divine non-presence\nis clothed in the mild-breathed language of\nlogicism and rationality,\nwhat stirs in us feeling\nenough to slacken faith\nand scorn perdition is the\natrociousness of evil and\nsuffering - the feeling that\nan all-kind, omniscient,\nand omnipotent God\ncouldn\u2019t possibly exist\nalongside mothers that\nmust bury their children.\nIt\u2019s a powerful argu-ment. The Wind of Heaven entertains this notion:\nits central characters, consciously or not, grapple\nwith the limits of mortal life and all the whips\nand pangs therein. The\nplay is centred just outside the Welsh mountain\nvillage of Blestin, which\nlost its children a decade\nago in an accident of unimaginable cruelty, and\nsets itself in the aftermath\nof the Crimean war - the\nmountain hospital overflows with maimed sol-diers, the threat of cholera\nand typhus never far off.\nConfronted with such suf-fering, and with a modern,\ngodless capitalism looming over the not-too-dis-tant horizon (represented\nhere by a fast-talking nou-veau-riche Birmingham\nbusinessman who owns a\ncircus named after him-self), it\u2019s only understandable that the village has\nno vicar and the church is\nnow a post office.\nBut then Jesus comes\nto Blestin in the form of\na Welsh teenage peasant.\nAs a widow struggles to\ncontain her grief and our\nBirmingham businessman confronts his past,\nthe village erupts in a religious revival over a boy\nwho can cure the sick and\nraise the dead. The Wind\nof Heaven fundamentally\nconcerns itself with the\npower faith has to trans-form, heal and revitalise\n- and the production does\nan excellent job of depicting the emotional growth\nreligion stirs in its characters (that the Finborough\nTheatre is such an intimate venue only heightens the experience).\nAnd yet it feels like\na cheat: the play\u2019s power is co-opted from the\nreverence which even today we offer to, say, the\nquiet and cold stalls of a\nchurch, rather than being generated internally.\nUpon the interval, after an\nachingly beautiful Welsh\nhymnal, I was as ready to\npreach the gospel as any\nman alive, but I couldn\u2019t\nhelp thinking that a good\nsermon would have provoked the same response.\nIn fact, it\u2019s a double cheat\n- by having Jesus raise the\ndead and cure the sick, the\nplay fails to meaningfully\nrespond to the problem of\nsuffering; even the play\u2019s\nDoubting Thomas, who\nargues that the whole fer-vour is just a case of mass\nhysteria, can only provide\nstrawman arguments. This\na didacticism, not a dia-lectic.\nAnd yet I can\u2019t write\noff the play so easily. The\nproduction\u2019s well staged,\nand that the script serves\nsome dubious lines in its\nreligious crusade is only\na credit to the cast who\npull them off. If this feels\nlike damning with faint\npraise, it is, but not in\nthe way you think: for all\nthis, I couldn\u2019t help but be\nmoved by the production,\nand I\u2019m still chewing on\nit. If I can\u2019t make a rational argument for you to see\nthis, I can certainly make\nan emotional one.\nNo Achilles heel in this exhibit // Wikimedia\nFELIX\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019\n30\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nFelix Swift Roberts\nArts Writer\nWhere?

On\nTuesday, December 3rd,\nthe Union President and\nDeputy President (Wel-fare) brought a paper to\nUnion Council for votes\nto be taken on several\naspects of the rent\nmodel. With regards to\nthe 12.2% rent hike, this\noption was voted 36:1\nin favour of rejecting it\ncompletely.\nThis session of Union\nCouncil saw around 30\nnon-Council members at-tending, who were mostly\nstudents keen to contribute\ntheir opinion on the issue\nthat they felt would be important to them. The rent\nsegment of Council began\nwith the Union President\nand Deputy President\n(Welfare) detailing the\ncircumstances.\nAs explained by them\nand as detailed in the last\nissue of Felix, College\nruns first-year student\naccommodation on a\nbreakeven model, where\nthe total cost of running\nthe halls is offset by the\nrevenue made from rent.\nThis model includes only\nfirst-year residences of the\naccommodation portfolio\n\u2013 Eastside, Southside,\nBeit, Wilson, Pembridge,\nand Woodward. Xenia\nand Costume Store are\nexternally owned and not\nconsidered a part of this\nmodel. The running cost\nis made up of expenses\nincluding staff salary,\nestates (security, cleaning,\nwaste management), a\nfund for long-term maintenance of the hall, as\nwell as the debt accrued\nfrom loans taken during\nthe actual construction of\nthe buildings. For older\nbuildings such as Beit\nand Wilson, this debt has\nlikely been nearly paid\noff; for newer buildings\nsuch as Woodward, the\ndebt is aimed to be paid\nback over a 50 year\nperiod. This additionally\nmeans that at the end of\nthe 50-year period, the\nCollege retains an asset\nthat has value and that\nhas no debt on it - a value\nwhich is not factored into\ntheir \"break-even\" model,\nand a value which is also\nlikely to appreciate or\nincrease over time as it\nis London real estate.\nNonetheless, these are all\npaid by the rent revenue\nfrom students, regardless\nof whether they live in the\nhall in which debt is being\npaid off for, or whether\nthey will ever experience\nthe benefits of the long-term maintenance fund\nthey are paying into.\nTo the best of the\nUnion\u2019s knowledge, new\ncosts that are not included\nin the current break-even\nmodel are being added\ninto the break-even model\nfor 2020/21. This includes\nan 80% increase in the\ncontribution towards the\nlong-term maintenance\nfund, and cost for staff\nwho work on halls off-site. These are the main\nreasons for the overall\n12.2% rent increase, and\nthis is what the Council\nhas voted to reject.\nWithout these included\ncosts, there is a possibility\nthat rent would not have\nto rise.\nEach of these factors\nreceived heavy criticism\nfrom students at the Union\nCouncil meeting. One\nstudent who spoke at the\nUnion Council meeting\nsaid: \"The College's\nfunding model is an insult\nto students who are meant\nto be financing this. They\nare not counting capital\ngains from their property\nholdings ... they are not\ncounting long term appreciation ... It's a disgrace\nthat they do this and then\nmake us pay for it. The\n12% increase in a year\nis ridiculous, and I really\nthink we should question\nwhat the Union is for if\nthey are not standing up\nagainst this.\"\nIndependently of\noverall rent hike, but still\na necessary part of the\ndiscussion, is how in the\ncoming years the price of\nrent should be distributed\nacross halls. Currently,\n27% of the freshers' cohort\nlive in North Acton.\nHowever, in 2020/21,\nCollege will be discontinuing the use of Pembridge\n(100 bed spaces) for\nstudent accommodation,\nand furthermore, the new\nKemp Porter building\n(700 bedspaces) in North\nActon will be opening\nfor first-year residence.\nUnion Council Votes 36:1 to Reject Increase in Halls\nDuring the Union Council meeting last Tuesday, the 12.2% rent increase proposed by College was discussed, the\n\u201cWith regards\nto the\nbreakeven\nmodel\nrequiring\na12.2% rent\nhike, it was\nvoted 36:1\nin favour of\nrejecting it\ncompletely\u201d\nThe Union Council and attending students at the rent discussion on Tuesday December 3rd\n// ICU\n\u201cThis means\nthat after\n50 years of\nstudents\npaying off\nthe debt,\nthe College\nis left with a\nvaluable asset\n- which is not\nconsidered\nin their\nbreakeven\nmodel\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Tragedy of the Commons: A Drama That Our Planet\nIs Not Enjoying\nY\nou may have\nheard of the\nterm tragedy of\nthe commons\nbefore, or you may have\neven studied about it. It\nis an important economic\nconcept and is extremely\nrelevant to many of the\nprevailing environmental\nissues. The problem stems\nfrom deep within human\nnature and is at the heart of\ncorruption and exploitation in this world. This\narticle aims to provide a\nbetter understanding of\nthis issue, focusing on\nthe perspective of the\nenvironment.\nTragedy of the\ncommons occurs when\nthere are common access\nresources (CARs), natural\nresources over which no\nprivate ownership has\nbeen established due to\nthe difficulty of excluding\npeople from using them.\nCARs include forests and\nSUSTAINABILITY\nImage of sea turtle entangled in a ghost net. Ghost nets make up 50% of all plastic pollutions in oceans and are\na result of a lack of regulation // Wikimedia\nSUSTAINABILITY\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019 FELIX\nsustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nXiuchen Xu\nSustainability Editor\npastures, fisheries, oil and\ngas fields, grazing lands,\nirrigation systems and\nmuch more. To examine\none example further:\nwith the case of oceans,\nit can be noted that their\nbodies of water are so\nincredibly vast that it is\nimpractical for one fishing\ncompany to establish\ncontrol of an entire ocean\nand stop others from\nusing it. Economists have\nhypothesised that with\nthe lack of ownership\nof resources, private\nproducers will act in their\nown self interests and\nexploit common access\nresources to maximise\nprofit. This exploitation\nis unsustainable, and will\nlead to the depletion of\nresources; this is known\nas the tragedy of the\ncommons. In other words,\ncommon access resources\nprovide an opportunity\nfor individuals to create\nprofit, while spreading\nselfish beings is extreme\nand grim, however, it\nseems that this view is\ncorrect in the case of\nhumans exploiting CARs.\nTragedy of the\ncommons is at the core\nof a widespread range of\nproblems that are relevant\nand threatening to natural\nresources, environments\nand human health. In\nthe case of overfishing,\nfishing companies are not\nresponsible for the state of\nthe ocean, and continue to\nfish as much as possible to\nmaximise revenue. Today,\n90% of fish stocks are\ndepleted. Furthermore,\nto save on fuel money\non their return journies,\nfishing boats discard their\ngiant heavy nets into the\nocean, which has accumulated to account for 50%\nof ocean plastics. These\nnets, known as \u201cghost\nnets\u201d, cause many animals\nto become entrapped in\nthem and die.\nTrawling is the\npractice of dragging\nlarge fishing nets across\nthe ocean floor, which is\nextremely damaging to\nmarine habitat. Due to the\nnumber of animals unintentionally getting caught\nin massive fishing nets,\nthere is a horrific practice\nof discarding the unintentionally caught animals\nback into the ocean, even\nif they\u2019re dead. From the\npoint of view of a single\nfisher, this is just what\nthey have to do in order\nto be offered competitive\nprices on the market and\ncompete with corporations engaed in unethical\nbusiness practices.\nAnother important\nresource is forests. For\nexample, the Amazon is\nconsidered to be the lungs\nof the planet, but is currently being exploited and\ndeliberately burnt down\nto make land for cattle\nfarming. In August alone,\nthere were 30,000 fires in\nthe Amazon, showing the\nhorrific nature of cooperate greed and extreme\nconsequences of resource\nexploitation.\nClean air can be considered a common access\nresource too, as everyone\nhave equal access. So,\nunless you choke someone\n(non-consensually, which\nis very illegal), you can\u2019t\nexclude someone from\nair. Companies have no\nincentive of protecting\nclean air, and will pollute\nas much as they want\nfor their own gain. The\nsame is happening with\nmany clean freshwater\nresources, which is being\npolluted at alarming rates.\nThe same concept also\nextends to the problem of\nantibiotic resistance. This\nis not a physical resource,\nbut abusing the use of\nantibiotics is profitable\nfor farmers to boost production and increase their\nnumber of livestock. This\nabuse leads to antibiotic\nresistant superbugs for\nwhich the consequences\nare suffered by all of\nhumanity. Indeed, animals\nin the US consume twice\nas much antibiotics as\nhumans, this statistic\nshows just how much\nantibiotics are misused in\nthe farming industry.\nThe reason for such a\ndiverse range of problems\n\u201cThe problem\nstems from\ndeep within\nhuman nature\nand is at\nthe heart of\ncorruption and\nexploitation\u201d\n\u201cAmazon was\nburnt down\nfor cattle\nfarming, which\ndemonstrates\nthe horrific\nnature of\ncooperate\ngreed.\u201d\nnegative externalities to\neveryone else. Indeed,\nthe economist view of\nhumans being completely\n\u201cProducers\nwill act in their\nself interest\nand exploit\nthose common\naccess\nresources to\nmaximise\nprofit\u201d\n72\n\n"

Film has\ndeveloped a lot over the\ncourse of the decade, we\nhave witnessed the release\nof the first Avengers\nfilm, a Star Wars return,\nTwilight happened, there\nwas a Frozen craze that\nfelt like it lasted forever\nand much, much more...\nMOONLIGHT (2016)\nWhen thinking of the\nbest and most important\nfilms of the decade, Moonlight was one of the first\nones to cross my mind.\nThis film made history\nwhen it became the first\nbest-picture winner from\nan African-American\nmoment where the award\nwas snatched away from\nLa La Land (thank god)\nto be correctly received\nby the crew of Moonlight\nafter a colossal error is\nunforgettable. A quick\nGoogle search has told\nme it was also the first\nbest-picture film to have\nLGBT-themes at the heart\nof the storyline \u2013 monumental is certainly a word\napt to describe this film.\nBefore I was ever\ninterested in keeping up\nwith new film releases,\nI decided to go watch\nMoonlight at the cinema\non a whim with my friend\nas he had been told it\nwas \u201cgood\u201d, and I left\nthe cinema stunned. The\ngorgeous cinematogra-phy, impeccable casting\nand acting, and beautiful\nexecution of the coming-of-age story of a gay black\nman were all achieved on\na low budget, making it\nall the more impressive.\nAlthough the systemic\nracism of The Academy\nand entire film industry\nsadly still hasn\u2019t been\neradicated, the recognition of this film was a step\nin the right direction and I\nam sure it will go down in\nhistory.\nof Into the Spider-Verse\nmanage to break the rules\nof animation with inspired\ncreative choices and\nby beautifully blending\nmultiple animation styles\ntogether with phenomenal\nresults. This film could\nmake the shortlist of\nmost influential films of\nthe decade based on its\ncreativity in visual design\nalone but brings so much\nmore. The way characters\u2019\nthoughts and feelings are\nportrayed in this piece\nis entirely unconvential\nbut undeniably real, an\naudience can feel every\nbetrayal, every ounce of\npain while never being too\nlong from comedic relief.\nMuch like the average\nImperial Student, Into the\nSpider-Verse does it all:\nsimplicity in terms of\nmeans of expression.\nIt\u2019s extraordinary how\nimmersive and hypnotic it\nfelt without digital special\neffects \u2013 that\u2019s due to\nbrilliant film and sound\nediting. All cuts match\nthe music perfectly and\nthey feel so natural and\nspontaneous, as if the film\nitself was an improvised\njazz piece. The beat and\nits pace are also essential\nin building up the tension\non the screen.\nFurthermore, Whiplash\nis minimalist in the\nnumber of characters\nand subplots. The main\nfocus of the story is the\ninteraction between the\nstudent and the teacher,\nand it\u2019s very clear from\nthe beginning until the\nend. As such, the message\nconveyed by the film is\nvery concise. Whiplash\nposes two important\nquestions: how much\nshould you sacrifice for\na successful career? And\nwhere is the line between\ntrying to push someone\nto succeed and bullying\n\u2013 does the end simply\njustify the means?\nWhiplash is one of a\nkind, not many films are\nas intense and memorable.\nGreat acting, a straightforward storyline with a\nsatisfying ending and the\nomnipresent rhythm make\nit one of the most important films of the decade.\nthat has now become\nalmost defined by biopics,\nwith every studio wanting\ntheir shot at an academy\naward, and so churning\nout (semi) non-fictional\npictures year after year.\nThe extremely talented\nFILM\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019 FELIX\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nexplaining the multiverse,\nconverting non-superhero\nfans, giving audiences\na killer soundtrack and\ndiverse characters that are\nbrought to life vividly, I\nwait in anticipation for the\nreturn of Miles Morales\nand co. in 2022.\nMahershala Ali and Alex Hibbert in Moonlight // A24\n34\nJasmin Daley\nFilm Writer\nZuzanna Janusz\nFilm Writer\nDominic Ede\nFilm Editor\nTHE SOCIAL NETWORK\n(2010)\nCutting it close but\nstill making it into this\ndecade, The Social\nNetwork established itself\nin late 2010 as one of the\nbest films to come out of\ncinema in recent years.\nTaking source material\nfrom an inherently lacklustre subject in Mark\nZuckerberg, a film about\nthe formation of website\ndoesn\u2019t sound like the\nmost riveting or exciting\nof topics, yet it is the exact\nopposite.\nKicking off the decade,\nthis film showed audiences exactly what a film\nshould be, with a perfect\nscript from Aaron Sorkin,\na perfect soundtrack from\nTrent Reznor (of NIN),\nand perfect directing from\nDavid Fincher, it seems\nit would\u2019ve been harder\nto make a bad film rather\nthan a good one with such\na talented line up.

Again, I really\nhave to draw back to the\nsoundtrack here, as there\nare very few films that are\nso brilliantly scored. The\nelectronic whiring along\nwith strung out synthesizers perfcetly encapsulate\nthe landscape that the plot\nis centred around, with\nan extremely unique and\niconic sound. As each\nbrilliant piece of this\npuzzle slotted together, it\ndefined itself as one of the\nmost important scenes of\nthe decade.\n\n"

    "content": "A brief history of jazz\nThisweek,tocelebrateFelix\u2019sanniversary,themusiceditorstakeusthroughthehistoryofpopulargenres,starting\nwith jazz\nB\ny the time this\nn e w s p a p e r\ncame into ex-istence, jazz\nwas already old \u2013 or at\nleast middle aged. Louis\nArmstrong had defined\nimprovisation, swing\nhad already been and\ngone, replaced by frantic bebop, cool jazz and\neventually fusion. Genres like rock and soul\nhad begun to rear their\nheads, offshoots of jazz\nblended with blues. The\nfact that jazz is a force to\nbe reckoned with years\nlater, is a unique feat.\nTo newly emancipated\nblack Americans, music\nrepresented a chance to\nescape poverty, as an employment unaffected by\nsegregation. This created\nan armada of black musicians that would shape\nthe music of the 20th\ncentury, and an attitude\nto music that can still be\nseen in impoverished US\ncommunities.\nIt is unsurprising then,\nthat African drumming,\nblues and work songs of\nex-slaves formed the cornerstones of what would\nlater be labelled \u201cAmerica\u2019s classical music\u201d.\nBorn in New Orleans, and\nfittingly played on instruments left over from civil\nwar marching bands, jazz\npassed through the typical\ncycle of public outrage\nand eventual acceptance\nwhile incubating in prohibition era speakeasies.\nBy the time the 30s rolled\naround, swing jazz was in\nfull \u2026 swing.\nAhighlydanceable(and\ntherefore popular) style,\nswing was built around big\nbands, the most famous of\nwhich was led by Duke\nEllington; these groups\nwere characterised by\ntheir juggernautian sound\nand uneven, swaggering\nrhythms. Solos were a key\ncomponent of the style,\nwith soloists building on\nthe foundations laid by\nLouis Armstrong, delivering intricate rhythms\nand interpolations of well-known melodies in feats\nof sheer virtuosity.\nAt the outbreak of\nWWII, big bands became\ndifficult to sustain, as musicians were conscripted\nin droves. Smaller bands\nbecame more common,\npioneered by innovators\nlike Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk and Dizzy\nGillespie, these groups\nadopted increasingly complex harmonies, featuring\ndissonance, modulations\nand passing chords.\nThe music was significantly faster, drumming\nfocused primarily on the\nride cymbal, punctuated\nwith off-beat snare hits\nand vigorous walking\nbasslines. This was the\nbirth of bebop, a style to\nbe listened to, not danced\nto.\nWhilst critically suc-cessful, and hugely influ-ential, bebop lacked the\npublic appeal of swing,\nand so gradually seceded\nto encroachments from of\na variety of other styles.\nEnter Miles Davis,\nwhose string of singles\nthat became Birth of the\nCool were a blueprint for\na more laid-back, sweet\nstyle of jazz, which balanced harmonic intrigue\nwith listenability \u2013 literally giving the word \u2018cool\u2019\nits meaning. Developed\nby the likes of Stan Getz,\nDave Brubeck and Paul\nDesmond, it wasn\u2019t until\n1959 that this relaxed\nstyle would take its next\n\u201cI\u2019ve changed\nthe course\nof music five\ntimes. What\nhave you done\nexcept fuck the\npresident?\u201dMiles Davis to\nNancy Raegan\nstep forward. Davis\u2019 Kind\nof Blue, recorded in only\n2 sessions, is widely considered as the greatest jazz\nalbum of all time, here\nMiles revolutionised the\ngenre for a second time.\n\u2018Modal jazz\u2019 focuses its\nimprovisations on a specific scale or mode, rather\nthan fitting each chord\nindividually. This helps\nbuild long, rich melody\nlines, modals jazz also\nfeatures sour chords and\nharmon muted trumpet,\nwith its distinctly whispered and seductive tone.\nArtists like Grant Green,\nWayne Shorter and Bill\nEvans, whose ambiguous\nchords created a sedate\nstyle of his own would\nperfect cool and modal\njazz into the 60s.\nMeanwhile influences\nfrom classical, distilled\nthrough the music of\nDuke Ellington\u2019s one-of-a-kind big band in the\n30s, was informing many\nartists, most notably band\nleader and bassist Charles\nMingus, whose raucus,\nand frankly terrifying\nharmonies found success\non records like Mingus\nAh Um. John Coltrane,\nafter building his name\non Davis influenced work,\nwould push the boat out\nwhich Davis replied:\n\u201cI\u2019ve changed the\ncourse of music five or\nsix times. What have\nyou done except fuck the\npresident?\u201d\nIt was with exactly this\nspirit that Miles Davis\nset out blending funk\nand rock into jazz, on his\nseminal records In a Silent\nWay and Bitches Brew.\nThese records sparked a\njazz fusion renaissance,\nwith a fascinating range\nof sounds, yielding classic\nrecords like The Weather\nReport, Head Hunters and\nRed Clay. Other artists\nwould incorporate these\ninfluences, as well as\npop into their improvisational styles, over softer\nbackdrops. This resulted\nin a growing number of\naccessible, commercially\nsuccessful records that\nwould earn artists like\nGeorge Benson the label\n\u2018sellout\u2019, and an awful lot\nof money.\nWhilst notable artists:\nWynton Marsalis, Roy\nHargrove, Vijay Iyer were\nactive throughout later\ndecades and acid jazz,\nsmooth jazz and hip-hop,\na genre which heavily\nsampled jazz were all\naround during the intermittent decades, there is\nnotably less to be said for\nthe late 70s through 00s.\nRecently however,\nartists like Thundercat,\nChristian Scott and\nKamasi Washington\nhave sprung up, taking\ncues from the changed\nmusical landscape, to\ndeliver electronic-tinged,\nrhythm-driven jazz,\nfinding a market of their\nown. London is notable\nfor its thriving, jazz scene,\nwith artists like Jacob\nCollier, Ezra Collective\nand Alfa Mist rising from\na sea of promising faces.\nFresh and exciting music,\nwith a distinctly British,\nsensibility is still flowing\nin abundance, readers\nare advised to take note.\nThese acts take cues from\nafrobeat legends like Fela\nKuti and hip-hop, focusing more heavily upon\nrhyhtm, than the radical\nharmonies of artists like\nChet Baker, in the last\nyear alone a vertiable\nfeast of music have been\nreleased.

So, please\ncherish this morsel of\npositivity amidst what\nhas been a sea of Union\ndespair.\nAfter a 2.5 hour council\nmeeting, last minute room\nbookings for the Science\nChallenge, and a 4 week\nwait for Fifi\u2019s signature on\na contract (in addition to\n100 other things we won\u2019t\nbore you with), you might\nbe wondering why we put\nup with all of this Union\nshit on top of our already\nhigh workload.\nJuggling degrees with\nour roles is no easy task\n(unless you study biology\nlike Alex). Sometimes\nwe forget why we\u2019re at\nImperial and the degree\nends up taking a backseat.\nThis week we both fell\ninto the deadly trap that\nresults in coursework\ngetting neglected in\nfavour of Presidential\nwork, and believe us, it\nonly ends in regret.\nBut how did we get\ninto this position in the\nfirst place? Well, we both\nhad very different routes\ninto our roles. Alex ran\nfor RCSU President on a\nwhim and was fortunate\nto just beat RON (I mean\nbarely\u2026). Meanwhile\nAishy had been planning\nher route to MathSoc\nPresidency since first year\nand was somehow roped\ninto a couple of other\nUnion roles along the\nway.\nAs an elected Union\nvolunteer, there can be\na great deal of pressure\nand responsibility placed\nupon you and your role\nmight end up consuming\nthe entirety of your life.\nIn fact, more than half of\nAlex\u2019s personality is now\nbeing the RCSU president.\nYou wake up thinking\nabout all the claims that\nneed approving, and you\ngo to bed frustrated, envisioning the million different ways that eActivities\ncould be improved. But\ndespite this, and no matter\nhow much you hear any of\nus complaining about the\nway the Union works (or\ndoesn\u2019t work), we really\ndo love our jobs!\nBeing on a committee,\nor in any role throughout\nthe Union, has massive\nrewards. Managing\nevents, like the RCSU\nAutumn ball, ensuring\nthat students\u2019 views are\nrepresented at council,\nsuch as at the recent Halls\nRent Debate, and slowly\ninstigating some operational changes within\nthe Union is incredibly\nsatisfying. Knowing\nthat your actions have a\ndirect, positive impact on\n100s to 1000s of students\nis enough of a return to\nmake our roles feel more\nthan worthwhile. With\nevery event we plan and\nevery cause we represent\ncontributes to building a\nstronger student commu-nity.\nWhat\u2019s more, volunteer\nroles can be a hell of a\nlot of fun and encourages\ninvolvement in something\nbigger than just yourself.\nWhat could be more\nglorious than stealing\nspanner from the CGCU\noffice right under their\nnoses at 11pm! The level\nof inter-constituent Union\nrivalry and support,\nparticularly with CGCU,\nhas made being a part of\nthe RCSU so much fun\nthis year. It sounds so\nclich\u00e9, but honestly the\nnumber of friends you\nmake through volunteering for the Union and the\nnumerous, entertaining\ngroup chats that form\nfrom these friendships is\nwhat keeps us going at the\nhardest and most stressful\nof times.\nLast week, we were\ninvited to attend the\nPhySoc Christmas dinner.\nIt was lovely to celebrate\nthe end of a jam-packed\nterm with loads of RCSU\nvolunteers, past and\npresent. The large number\nof students who take up\nvolunteer roles year after\nyear, both within and\noutside of the RCSU,\nis a testament to how\nmuch we all genuinely\nenjoy serving our fellow\nstudents. I can say for\ncertain that neither of will\never regret holding these\nroles, they have shaped\nour university experiences for the better. I mean,\nwhat would uni even be\nwithout all of this Union\ndrama? We honestly can\u2019t\nimagine it.\nThank you all for reading\nthis atypical column. This\nis probably the sappiest\nwe\u2019re going to get in this\ncolumn, so don\u2019t get used\nto it.\nOn behalf of the whole\nRCSU committee, we\nwould like to wish you a\nhappy holidays/revision\nperiod.

MTSoc\u2019s\nmedley of musical classics\nhopes to scratch that itch\nwith over fifteen musicals\nrepresented! With more\nthan 45 performers taking\npart in the show in small\ngroups, the audience was\ntransported across the musical theatre universe in\nshort, snappy songs, with\nsome being a little more\nmemorable than others.\nDaria Ditri\u2019s solo\nperformance in the song\n\u201cPortrait of a Princess\u201d\nfrom Unwritten Songs was\none of the highlights of the\nnight. The song itself is a\nquite daring, combining\nDisney princess stereotypes with much dirtier\nhumour. It takes a lot to\nbe able to sing in a Snow\nWhite-esqe voice while\npretending to pleasure\nyour prince charming and\nnot make it look a little\nawkward. Luckily for the\naudience, Ditri executed\nthe performance wonder-fully. With a very strong\nvoice and impeccable\ncomedic timing, her performance was one of the\nmost memorable, despite\nbeing one of the few songs\nperformed solo,.\n\u201cHis Work and Nothing\nMore\u201d from Jekyll &\nHyde was another really\nstrong performance.\nSebastian Berger, Paul\nMonaghan, Celine\nDriessen and Sam Winiarski managed to pull off\nthis difficult song through\nmasterful coordination\nand amazing vocals. The\nreal highlight of the first\nact, was the visually and\nvocally striking \u201cHellfire\u201d\nfrom The Hunchback of\nNotre Dame. When robed\nmen carrying candles\nslowly marched onto the\nstage from the audience\nfollowed by Daniella\nGimbosh\u2019s mesmerizing\ndancing, you knew good\nthings are to come. From\nthe moment Jonathan\nHedley sang the first note,\nthe audience was silent as\nhis deep enchanted voice\ncaptures everyone in the\nroom. Even more so than\nhis singing, it was his\nability to sell the character\nhe was portraying that\nmade his performance so\nremarkable.\nIn medley shows, it can\nbe a little weird jumping\nthrough completely different plots and moods,\nso performers have to\nfully commit to each act.\nUnfortunately, sometimes\ncommitting simply isn\u2019t\nenough. For example\nwith Manuel Pestana\nGageiro\u2019s performance of\n\u201cNever Ever Getting Rid\nof Me\u201d from Waitress.\nDespite truly embodying\nthe character and selling\nthe story to the audience,\na combination of sound\nissues and a lack of enunciation meant that most of\nthe jokes were lost. Fixing\nthese issues could have\nmade what was a great\nperformance brilliant.\nThere were many other\namazing performances\nfrom musicals such\nas Hamilton and Six.\nHowever, the standout\nones mentioned above\nall had something\nin common, they all\nfollowed the rule that less\nis more. When it comes to\ncoordinating over twenty\nperformers on stage, for\nexample during the Hairspray classic You Can\u2019t\nStop the Beat, even if the\nperformers and audience\nare having a blast, things\nhave a tendency to look\nmessy. During these\nbigger dance numbers, the\nperformers with a dance\nbackground stood out,\nlike the very talented and\ngraceful Ella Reich.\nOn the whole, this was\na fun show to watch for\nmusical theatre fans and\nnovices alike, with plenty\nof talent on display. Keep\nyour eyes peeled for\nMTSoc\u2019s next show!\nDramSoc\u2019s Macbeth scores a MacBI\ndon\u2019t remember\nmuch about Macbeth,\nhaving only studied\nit briefly in my\nearly secondary school\ndays. While I may have\nforgotten the plot and the\ncharacters\u2019 names, I could\nnever forget the feeling\nof empowerment I experienced after learning of\nmy king-slayer potential\nwrought from the circumstances of my caesarean\nbirth.? You may have your\nfull-term, spontaneous\nvaginal deliveries but I\nwas born to topple tyrannous regimes.\nMacbeth, with its bubbling cauldrons, moving\nforests, and ferocious in-ter-clan warring, is a play\nthat demands powerful\nvisuals and creative use of\nthe theatre space. Unfortunately, DramSoc\u2019s production just didn\u2019t deliver.\nUsing budget constraints\nas an excuse can only get\nyou so far in explaining\nthe complete lack of attention to aesthetic and\ndesign. The backdrops,\nvital in transporting the\naudience to specific set-tings, were merely pieces\nof card stuck together to\nform shapeless, detail-less\ncanvases. One might as\nwell lower green screens\ninstead and have the audience imagine a castle\nwall. The costumes, if you\ncould call black t-shirts\nand jeans a costume, were\ndisappointing even by college production standards.\nBizarrely, the witches\nwere dressed as post-war\noffice secretaries, further\nadding to the directorial\nconfusion surrounding\nthe production. The lack\nof finish may have been\nacceptable in primary\nschool but given Imperial\u2019s talented student pop-ulation, the wealth of art/\nfashion clubs, and the\nmembers\u2019own purchasing\npower, the show should\nnot have ended up looking\nso nightmarishly amateur.\nThe acting, for the\nmost part, was fine. Yuyu\nLee played the titular role\nwell, if a little too cheerfully pre-regicide. While\nhis labile mood may have\nout of place for the grizzled war veteran we were\nintroduced to at the be-ginning. There were two\nstandout performances for\nme. Nick Twyman, playing King Duncan, was a\ndelight to watch, expertly\ndelivering his lines with\nstyle and warmth. It is\none thing to understand\nand regurgitate the lines\nof a Shakespeare play,\nquite another to speak\neach word as though it is\nspontaneous thought. The\nother standout was Valerie\nLau. While Twyman gave\na comfortable, laid back\nperformance, Lau brought\nforth the opposite. Her\nMacDuff, trembling with\nrighteous fury after the\nslaughter of his family,\ncarried the second act\nwith a dramatic intensity\nbefitting a larger stage and\na better sword.\nIt is unfortunate that\nthe talent on stage was\nlet down by such poor di-rection. Even the lighting\nand sound were poorly\nutilised. Prop movement\nand scene-changes were\ncoordinated poorly with\nblackouts and sound effects were so sporadic that\nit distracted rather than\nsupported the action on\nstage.\nIn the end, there was\nlittle to commend in this\nproduction of Macbeth\nsave the cast. Next time\nDramSoc puts on a show,\nI hope they\u2019re willing to\nat least shell out the \u00a32 for\nretractable prop knives.\nDaria Ditri was the fairest of them all // Khai Leed Yau\nARTS\nSyon Lee\nArts Editor\nWhere?

    "content": "A Decade of UK Politics\nPOLITICS\nAnsh Bhatnagar\nPolitics Writer\nA\ns the clock ticked midnight on 1st January 2010, the nation celebrated the completion of an entire decade into the new millennium.At\nthe time, 10 Downing Street was occupied by Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister who took the country through the global financial\ncrash of 2008. Brown had been part of \u2018New Labour\u2019 governments since 1997, first as Chancellor of the Exchequer and then taking\nover as Prime Minister after Tony Blair. \u2018New Labour\u2019, of course, had been Blair\u2019s political rebranding of the Labour Party in an\neffort to move it away from it\u2019s left wing past and place it firmly into the centre-ground of British politics, with even Margaret Thatcher having\nsaid that her greatest achievement was \u201cTony Blair and New Labour. We forced our opponents to change their minds.\u201d\nIn the wake of the global financial crash and the failure that was the Iraq War, the new Conservative Party leader David Cameron successfully\ncreated a narrative that the state was like a household budget \u2013 and that the deficit and debt of New Labour due to the bailing out of the banks\nhad to be eliminated. With the Liberal Democrats also having a new leader in Nick Clegg, the stage was set for a General Election.\nIn this article, Ansh goes through a condensed history of the past 10 years of UK politics. With a General Election\nimminent, it is time to strap in for a ride through recent history to see how we arrived to the politics of today.\nFELIX\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Conservatives had\nbeen leading in the polls\nconsistently since October 2007, with by-election\nand EU results to show\nfor it. The results: a hung\nparliament with the Tories the largest party and\nthe Liberal Democrats\nwith enough MPs to be\nthe kingmakers, and after\ndays of talks and a concession from the Tories to\nhold a referendum on getting rid of the First Past\nThe Post voting system in\nfavour of the Alternative\nVote (AV), the two parties\nemerged as a coalition\ngovernment.\nGordon Brown resigned from the leader-ship, triggering a Labour\nleadership contest. The\nkey figures emerging were\ntwo brothers: Ed and David Miliband, the sons of\nMarxist academic Ralph\nMiliband. The Labour left\noffered Dianne Abbott,\nthe first black woman MP\nto be elected to Parliament, for the leadership,\nhowever this campaign\nwas carried out with little\nsupport. With Ed being\nseen as the more left\nwing candidate, and his\nbrother being seen very\nmuch as a continuation\nof New Labour politics,\nthe membership decided\nit was time for a change\naway from New Labour\nand elected Ed.\nThe AV referendum\ntook place a year after,\nand with the Lib Dems\nbeing the only major\nparty to support AV, the\ncampaign for AV was\nresoundingly rejected at\nthe ballot box with 68%\nvoting against its intro-duction.\nAfter the Scottish National\nParty stood on a manifesto\nfor a referendum on Scottish\nindependence and won an\noverwhelming victory at the\nScottish Parliament elections,\nand with continued pressure\non the Coalition government\nfrom the party, the Coalition\nagreed to legislate for an\nindependence referendum\nand worked with the Scottish\ngovernment to arrange it for\nthe Autumn of 2014.\nBoth the Tories and Labour\nteamed up to make the case\nfor the union, promising\nfurther devolved powers if the\npeople of Scotland voted to\nstay in the union. Ultimately,\nindependence was rejected\nand further devolved powers\nwere delivered later on. The\nScottish First Minister and\nSNP leader Alex\nSalmond resigned in light\nof the defeat, with Nicola\nSturgeon becoming the new\nSNP leader and First Minister.\nThe Referendum was touted as a once in a generation\nvote \u2013 an attitude that would\nchange because of a different\nreferendum a couple years\ndown the line\u2026\nWith the Coalition government having overseen\nyears of devastating cuts\nto public services and\nwith Liberal Democrat\npopularity at an all time\nlow, the 2015 General\nElection saw Labour leader Ed Miliband concede\ntoo much to the political\ncentre \u2013 with an example being the infamous\nrelease of mugs that had\n\u201ccontrols on immigration\u201d\nwritten on them. In the\nCoalition, the Lib Dems\nhad reneged on their\npromise to students of not\nincreasing tuition fees \u2013\ninstead tripling them to\n\u00a39k a year. Emblematic of\nLabour\u2019s response to the\nCoalition, their manifesto\nonly proposed cutting\nfees to \u00a36k \u2013 still double\nthat of the fees in 2010.\nWith a combination of\nthis, and a hostile press\ncharacterising him as\na weak leader, it is no\nsurprise Miliband lost the\nelection, even surprising\npundits and pollsters\nexpecting another hung\nparliament but instead\nCameron had won a majority after having promised a referendum on the\nUK\u2019s membership of the\nEU during the election\ncampaign. This decision\nmeant he could appease\nEurosceptic voters who\notherwise would\u2019ve voted\nfor Nigel Farage\u2019s UK Independence Party (UKIP)\nand split the Tory vote in\nmany areas, delivering\nseats to the opposition.\nThe decision was taken\nunder the impression that\nCameron\u2019s favoured side,\nRemain, would easily win\nthe referendum. As we\nare all aware, this impression proved to be fatally\nincorrect.\nMiliband resigned the\nleadership, triggering a\nfresh Labour leadership\nelection. With centrist/\ncentre-left establishment\nfigures like Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper, and\nLiz Kendall in the race,\nbackbencher Jeremy\nCorbyn put his hat in\nthe ring as the candidate\nfor the Labour left. Seen\nwidely by pundits as an\noutsider with little chance\nof winning, Corbyn won\nby a landslide on a platform of firmly rejecting\nthe austerity agenda and\nbringing the party back to\nits left wing roots.\nGeneral election 2010\nGeneral election 2015\nScottish Independence\nReferendum 2014\nEd Miliband 2015 // Wikimedia\n16\n\n"

This modern\nretelling considers what\ncould have happened if\nJuliet (Miriam-Teak Lee)\nwas given a life beyond\nRomeo. She travels to\nParis with an entourage\nconsisting of Nurse\n(Melanie La Barrie) her\nmother figure, and her\nbest friends Anne (Juliet\nCassidy Janson) and May\n(Arun Blair-Mangat).\nExpanding on the\nuniversal themes of love\nand tragedy found in\nthe original story, this\nrendition puts a modern\ntwist on Juliet who is presented as a fully-formed,\nindependent woman. If\nthis premise seems a bit\ninfantile and simple at\nfirst glance, fear not as it\nis actually a story within\na story. These two parallel\nstories seem a bit cliche\nin the opening half, but\nin the second half, this\nadded dimension is used\nas a way of exploring\nthe relationship between\nWilliam Shakespeare\n(Oliver Tompsett) and\nAnne Hathaway - yes she\nis his wife and Juliet\u2019s\nbest friend, keep up! Anne\nHathaway, despite being\nShakespeare\u2019s wife is\nalmost never mentioned\nin his work and has never\nbeen known historically\nin her own right. This parallels Juliet\u2019s characteri-sation, simply as Romeo\u2019s\nplus one, in the original\nVeronian story. Anne\u2019s\nstory is explored subtly\nat first, culminating in a\npowerful, slightly in your\nface, scene where she puts\nher feelings raw for the\naudience to understand.\nWhat makes this\nmusical stand out, and\nwhat will undoubtedly\nmake it a big success, is\n\u201cWere Ariana,\nBritney, and\nKesha ever\nmeant to meet\nShakespeare?\u201d\nhow every emotional high\nand low is framed by a\nmodern hit by writer and\nproducer Max Martin.\nFrom Ariana Grande\u2019s\nBreak Free, to Britney\u2019s\nOops!... I Did It Again,\neach song fits perfectly in\nit\u2019s moment while retaining a little of the absurdity.\nWere Ariana, Britney and\nKesha ever meant to meet\nShakespeare?\nThe nurse (Melanie La\nBarrie) is definitely one of\nthe most loved characters\nby the audience. The\nattitude, personality and\nhumour that La Barre\nbrings to the role is perfect\nfor the story.\nThe musical does make\na concerted effort to have\na diverse set of characters\nand May played by Arun\nBlair-Mangat is presented\nas the token LGBTQ+.\nWhen May bounces onto\nthe scene as the stereotypical gay best friend, you\ncould feel a few eyes roll\nin the audience. It is of\ncourse amazing to have\nthis type of unapologetic\nrepresentation, but this\nfirst impression, playing\non classic stereotypes,\nwas disappointing. As\nthe story progresses and\nMay\u2019s narrative is interwoven into the wider plot,\nmore complex, nuanced\ncharacteristics are pushed\nto the forefront. It was\nnot made overtly clear,\nbut after May\u2019s heartfelt\nrendition of I\u2019m Not a\nGirl, Not Yet a Woman by\nBritney Spears, it seemed\nthat the character was\nalso being presented as a\none questioning their own\ngender identity. A more\nexplicit approach, in the\nstyle of May\u2019s original\npresentation, may have\nmade more of an impact\nbut this was nonetheless a\nvery welcome representa-tion.\nA special shoutout\nhas to be made to the set\ndesigners and costume designers on this production\nas they contributed to the\nkiller combination of traditional with the modern.\nThe set was spectacular,\nbringing together a double\nrotating stage (move over\nLesMis!)whichcouldalso\nbecome a raised platform.\nAlmost every scene had a\ndifferent set which would\nbe seamlessly wheeled in;\nthe audience hardly had to\nuse their imagination at\nall! Together, the set and\nthe costumes combined\nthe fun and glitter of a\npre-teen Jojo Siwa fan\nwith a more grungier aesthetic of the same teenager\na few years later.\nSome people are quick\nto turn their noses up at\nthose who seek to instil\na bit of modern pop fun\ninto the theatre world of\nby creating these jukebox\nmusicals. However,\nnot only do these new\nproductions draw a wider\naudience into the theatre\nbut they also tell very\nimportant stories with\nwider representation than\nmore traditional musicals.\nIf you like Shakespeare,\nAriana Grande or the\nBackstreet Boys this is the\nshow is for you!\nLeft to right: Anne (Juliet Cassidy Janson), Juliet (Miriam-Teak Lee), Nurse (Melanie La Barrie) // Johan Persson\nEamon Akil Farhat\nArts Editor\nWhere?

But you should.\nSCIENCE\nArianne New\nScience Writer\n\u201cHis\ncontributions\nto the field\nare immense,\npioneering\ncountless\ncatalytic\nprocesses and\nimpacting\na variety of\napplications\u201d\nA\nny student who\nhas been to\nthe Chemistry\nCaf\u00e9 would\nhave seen the portrait of\nSir Geoffrey Wilkinson\nat least once. Lying at\nthe back of the caf\u00e9, with\nmore pictures dotted\nthroughout the building,\nand even his research\npaper framed right out-side, he surely must be\nof importance. While\nmost of us Chemistry\nstudents would know him,\nhis legacy is less known\nthroughout Imperial, and\neven less understood\npast the Department of\nChemistry. Who really\nwas he? What did he actually do to contribute to\nscience?\nSir Geoffrey Wilkinson was born and raised\nin Springside, a small\nvillage in West Yorkshire\nby Henry and Ruth\nWilkinson, a master house\npainter and weaver. Since\nhis youth, he developed\nan interest in chemistry\nthrough his uncle, who\nhad started a company\nmaking Epsom and Glauber\u2019s salt for pharmaceutical companies, frequently\ntagging along to lab and\ncompany visits.\nAs a teenager, he\nattended secondary school\nin Todmorden: a school\nwith an interesting history\nand eventual coincidence.\nHe was educated by the\nsame Physics teacher\nas Sir John Cockcroft,\nwho went on to receive\na Nobel Prize in Physics\nin 1951, as Sir Wilkinson\ndid himself in the field of\nChemistry.\nIn 1939, he received\na scholarship to study at\nImperial, and eventually\ngraduated with a PhD\nin 1941, during World\nWar II. He continued\nhis research at Imperial\nunder the guidance of\nProfessor Briscoe (whom\nthe current Briscoe Lab in\nthe Chemistry Building is\nnamed after), and joined\ntheAtomic Energy Project\nin 1943, finding multiple\nnew isotopes through\nthe project. Having been\nadvised against taking\nup an academic position\nin nuclear chemistry in\nEngland by Briscoe, Sir\nWilkinson eventually\nreturned to his original\ninterest of transition metal\ncomplexes.\nBack at Imperial in\n1956, he devoted nearly\nall of his time to transition metals, especially to\nruthenium, rhodium and\nrhenium in unsaturated\nhydrocarbons and metal\nhydrogen bonds. This\nlead to his first famous\nnamesake - Wilkinson\u2019s\ncatalyst - a rhodium-based\ncoordinate complex with\nthe formula RhCl(PPh)3,\nwhich Sir Wilkinson\nhimself popularised the\nuse of. His catalytic\norganometallic studies\neventually furthered the\ndevelopment of such\ncoordination complexes\nin these specific elements.\nThis catalyst is also used\nwidely in alkene hydro-genation, amongst others,\nsuch as hydroacylation or\nhydroboration, and even\nset the basis for ongoing\nasymmetric catalysis\nresearch.\nHis next finding, which\nwon him the Nobel Prize\nin 1973, was regarding the\nstructure of ferrocene - a\ncompound consisting of\none iron metal centre\nplaced between two cyclo-pentadienes. Curious after\nreading about this newly\nsynthesised mysterious\ncompound in the news, Sir\nWilkinson worked hard to\ndetermine its structure and\nsynthesise other similar\ncompounds, now known\nas metallocenes. Metallocenes are now used\nas active homogenous\ncatalysts in specialized\nreactions, such as olefin\npolymerisation, with\nfurther applications being\nin rechargeable lithium\nbatteries, food packaging\nand carbon nanotubes.\nOn a personal level,\nhe is remembered as a\ncurious, driven and enthusiastic person. His love\nfor Chemistry prevailed\ndespite all setbacks, and\nwhile it may have seemed\nchallenging to his peers\nand students, it proved\nwell for his legacy.\nSir Wilkinson\u2019s story is\none of passion, hard work,\nand eventual success.\nThis does not happen to\neveryone - in fact, it is\nquite unlikely to occur.\nIt is the story of a young\nboy who had a passion\nfor chemistry, chose to\npursue it, and eventually\nachieved the prize of\nhighest recognition in the\nfield. He reignited interest\nand further developed the\nfield of organometallics,\nspearheading it to become\none of the major fields in\nchemistry and chemical\nresearch today. His\ncontributions to the field\nare immense, pioneering\ncountless catalytic pro-cesses, impacting both\nresearch and development\nof industrial applications.\nYet, as impossible as\nit may sound, it truly\nhappened in this modern\nday and age. One may say\nthat it requires a person of\na certain calibre to achieve\nsuch successes, however,\nwhile knowledge and\nacademic ability were\ncertainly main factors, it\nwas only made possible\nthrough his passion,\nperseverance, and drive to\nsucceed.\nAs a fellow student, I\nfind his story quite inspir-ing. There are times when\nall of us feel like giving up\n- some of us think of this\noccasionally, others much\nmore often. Our degrees\nare also so different that\nit is quite impossible to\ncompare them. However,\nwhenever we feel down or\nhave lost hope, it is stories\nlike these which, be it by\nbelieving that success\nis more probable, or by\nreminding ourselves of\nour passions, will give us\na little optimism, and just\na small flame of hope that\neverything will eventually\nturn out alright.\nAs this issue of Felix\ncelebrates our 70th anni-versary, this article celebrated and remembered\nthe contributions of one\nof our former members\nof staff to the field of\norganometallic chemistry.\nIf you would like to know\nmore about Sir Geoffrey\nWilkinson, we recommend the piece he wrote\non the official Nobel Prize\nwebsite, or speaking to\nthe many professors from\nthe Chemistry department\nwho remember him.\nSir Geoffrey Wilkinson at the Nobel ceremony // mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org\nISSUE 1737\n\n"

This historical\nphase is parallel to the\nEuropean economic crisis\nand its aftermath, which\nwere particularly intense\nin Southern European\ncountries like Spain.\nArguably, most of the\nlast decade\u2019s events were\nultimately motivated by\nthis unstable setting.\n2010 was the last year\nof PSOE\u2019s (social democratic party) government\nafter the 2008 crisis.\nThe party\u2019s denial of the\nISSUE 1737\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nis called today 15-M. For\nmany historians it marked\nthe end of the old democratic era of Spain.\nMonths later, general\nelections were held and\nPP (right-wing party)\nwon. During this legislature emeritus King Juan\nCarlos I abdicated in his\nson Felipe VI, after a corruption case involving the\nroyal family. Under these\npolitical circumstances\ntwo new parties entered\nthe scene: Ciudadanos\n(centre) and Podemos\n(left, born out of 15-M).\nThe 2015 elections constituted the end of the bipartisan parliament, but after\nnot being able to form a\ngoverning majority, elections were held again in\n2016 and PP managed to\nstay in power.\n\u201cMost of the\nlast decade\u2019s\nevents were\nultimately\nmotivated by\nthis unstable\nsetting\u201d\nThe End of a Decade: Italy\nT\nhe past decade\nhas witnessed a\nproper political\nearthquake in\nItalian politics: what\nonce was is no more. The\npolitical framework that\nhas been in place since the\nnineties has fallen \u2013 the\nabrupt political changes\nthat have occurred are\nsimilar to the previous\nlargescale reshaping\nof the political system.\nIndeed, three decades\nago, the dissolution of\nthe two main parties, the\nItalian Communist Party\n(PCI) and the Christian\nDemocracy (DC) was\nregarded as the end of\nthe First Republic, which\nwas formed after WWII.\nPOLITICS\nLuca Rameli\nPolitics Writer\nNowadays, the recent\nchange in the political\nsystem is said to be the\nfall of the Second Italian\nRepublic, and the birth of\nthe Third one.\nLet us review this step-by-step: at the beginning\nof the decade, Italy was\nstill recovering from the\ndire economic situation\ncaused by the 2008 financial crisis. Under these\ncircumstances, the President of the Republic asked\nPM Silvio Berlusconi to\nresign and asked for the\nformation of a national\nunity government, a coalition containing almost\nall parties, so that the\neconomic crisis could\nbe faced as a cohesive\ngovernment body rather\nthan a fractured one. In\n2011 economist Mario\nMonti was chosen to take\nSilvio Berlusconi\u2019s place.\nHis government helped\nrestore creditors\u2019 trust in\nItaly, but his application\nof austerity measures\nfollowing EU directives\nplus the sluggish reprise\nof the country\u2019s growth\nmade him a polarising\nfigure, with people either\nsupporting his austerity policies or deeply\ncondemning them. This\nresulted in a hung Parliament following the 2013\nelections. Ultimately,\ncentre-left Democratic\nParty (PD) formed a\ngovernment with a group\nof dissident MPs who\nhad left Berlusconi\u2019s cen-tre-right party.\nThe most characteristic figure in this period\nhas certainly been PD\u2019s\nyoung Secretary Matteo\nRenzi, who initially had\nvast popularity, but later\nlost much of his approval\nafter the result of a Constitutional Referendum\nproposed by his party.\nThis referendum, which\nwas focused on possibly\nreforming the legislative\nbranch, took place in\n2016 and was a striking\ndefeat for Renzi. In 2018,\nnew elections saw instead\nthe impressive success\nof two populist parties,\nthe Five Star Movement\nand the League. The\nlatter is led by Matteo\nSalvini, who managed\nto shift many moderate\nvoters of Berlusconi to\nthe more right-wing views\nof his own party. Both\nSalvini and the Five Star\nMovement profited off of\nItalians\u2019 distrust of insti-tutions, which stems from\nprolonged economic stag-nation, with Italy trailing\nother European and G7\ncountries in growth (last\nyear just 0.9% of GDP).\nThese two parties originally wanted to form\na coalition, but internal\ntensions and Salvini\u2019s\ndesire for new elections,\ngiven his party\u2019s roaring\nnumbers in recent polls,\ncollapsed the coalition.\nThis paved the way for\nthe current government\nformed between PD and\nthe Five Star Movement\nitself.\nWhilst uncertainty and\nvolatile coalitions have\nbeen a constant in Italian\npolitics, a further change\nmay therefore soon await\nus: the new majority\nseems indeed to be as\ntense and unstable as its\npredecessors, and the\neventuality of elections\nseems therefore to be\nmore plausible from day\nto day.\nMeanwhile, the independence movement in\nCatalonia (North-Eastern\narea of Spain), a phenomenon that has centuries of\nhistory, had been strength-eningandseparatistparties\nhad formed a majority in\nthe Catalonian parliament.\nIn 2017, Catalonia`s government held an illegal\nindependence referendum\nand declared the formation of the Republic of\nCatalonia. The Spanish\ncentral government intervened with armed forces\nand separatist political\nleaders fled the country\nafter being sentenced to\nprison for rebellion and\nhave not come back since.\nIn 2018, a no confidence vote against PP\nwas put forward due to\nthe many corruption cases\nuncovered during their\nlegislature. After a year of\nprovisional government,\nelections were held giving\na majority to PSOE, but\ntheir inability to reach an\nagreement with Unidas\nPodemos led to another set\nof elections in November.\nPSOE won again and have\nagreed to form a coalition\nwith Unidas Podemos\nafter the threat of the rise\nof VOX (alt-right party).\nThis last decade of\nSpanish politics witnessed\nthe end of the old political\nsystem, exposed the fragility of the social structure and demonstrated the\nnecessity of addressing\nCatalonia\u2019s separatism.\nWe begin this new decade\nwith the possibility of a\nleft government, a chance\nfor change and a future of\ndemocratic prosperity.\nThe Italian flag// Wikimedia\nThe Spanish flag// Wikimedia\ncrisis left the country\nunprepared and resulted\nin historic unemployment\nnumbers and the introduction of austerity measures.\nThis situation resulted\nin millions of civilians\nspontaneously taking\nover main squares around\nthe whole country in the\nform of protests, in what\n18\n\n"

    "content": "How Computers took our music away\nFollowing the brief histories of jazz and rock, Felix now takes a look at the history of electronic music\nP\nutting the history\nof a whole genre\nof music to paper\nis a mammoth\ntask, especially for\na genre as fluid and\ndiverse as electronic\nmusic, so please forgive\nany oversight I may\nhave made in trying to\naccomplish it. It is a story\nof technical innovation,\nexperimentation, and of\npeople coming together.\nLaying the\ngroundwork\nMusic has always been\nan art-form whose boundaries have been set by\nthe tools that musicians\nhad at their disposal.\n500 years ago, medieval\ntowns would wait for\nages for troubadours\nto swing by to dish out\nsome simple harmonies.\nIn the following centu-ries, music played on\ncarefully crafted instruments remained a luxury\ncontained in swanky\nballrooms, danced to by\nold men with powdered\nfaces and wigs.\nThe explosion of\npopular music (music\nfor the PEOPLE) in the\n20th century coincided\nwith the new-found\nmass-production of\ninstruments, which made\nthem affordable. This unprecedented availability\nof music for the people\nmeant that instruments\nwere no longer only a\nmedium for routinised\nrecitals of age-old melodies but also a platform\nfor experimentation. The\ntried and tested was to\nbe eschewed for fresher\nsounds, something which\nboth the spirit of jazz,\nwhich took off long before electronic music, and\natonal chamber composi-tions, whose composers\nbegan to rise at the turn\nof the 20th century, laid\nthe foundations for.\nEarly experimentation\nwith electronic music was\nlimited to creative uses of\nthe newly invented electric tape. This allowed for\nlayering of instruments in\na different way (now not\nsolely by synchronous\nplaying), controlling\nthe speed and pitch of\nthe sounds, and overall\nshowed a glimpse that\nelectronic recording of\nanalogue sounds allowed\nfor creation of sounds\nthat traditional instruments couldn\u2019t fashion.\nThis was followed by the\ninvention of sine-wave\noscillators, modulators,\nfilters, mixers, and a\nwhole host of other audio\nmanipulation equipment.\nStudios centred in Cologne, Tokyo, Paris, as\nwell as the USA began\nto be filled by these, and\nthe inventions eventually\nbegan to filter through\nto the bands of the time.\nWhether it was using the\nTheremin to add a new\ndimension to their sound,\nspeeding up recordings\nmade on tape to play\nwith tonality (see George\nMartin and Strawberry\nfields forever), these\ninventions allowed for\nsonic experimentalism\nthat had not been seen\nbefore. Without them,\nPsychedelic and Progressive rock, as well\nas Krautrock, would not\nhave been possible.\nBut the most important invention of the\n60s for the future of\nelectronic music was the\nMoog modular, one of\nthe first in a long line of\nsynthesisers manufactured by Robert Moog.\nIt defined the interface\nthat synthesisers still\ncarry to this day, and its\nwealth of modular sound\nbuilding possibilities\nindirectly spawned a\nwhole host of musical\ngenres. Moog\u2019s name,\nalong with Don Buchla\u2019s\n(Moog\u2019s brother in arms\nin the field of modular\nsynthesisers), forms an\nimportant part of the lore\nof electronic music. Creation of completely novel\nits message of equality\nwill always proliferate.\nIt was not just in the\nmelodic aspect that house\nborrowed (or rather\nextensively sampled)\nfrom Disco. Disco was\nthe soundtrack to the\ncocaine epidemic and\nthe lever which lifted\nthe ban on sexuality on\nthe dancefloor, and it\nwould pass on both the\nuse of intoxicants and the\nemphasis on free expression through dance to its\nChicago fledgling. Along\nwith Jesse Saunders,\nKnuckles utilised newly\ncommercially available\ndrum machines in order\nto make disco bouncier\nand even more suitable\nfor dancing. The hypnotic\nbeat programming of the\nRoland TR-808 would\nbecome the rhythmic\nparadigm of the decade,\ninspiring early Hip-Hop\nMCs amongst others.\nJumping across lake\nMichigan to the border\nwith Canada, techno was\nbeing born around the\nsame time. It was inevitable that Detroit would\nbe the setting for another\nmusical explosion.\nHaving given birth to so\nmany great musicians\njust two decades prior,\nmotor city was beginning\nto lose its sparkle.

The art is\nbeautiful, the gameplay\nis insanely enjoyable\nand most importantly the\nmessage really spoke to\nme. I urge anyone who\nhasn\u2019t heard of it to pick\nit up and give it a go. I\nlove it and really hope it\nwins this award, getting\nmore exposure. I think it\nis likely to win, although\nSea of Solitude and Life is\nStrange 2 as far as impact\ngoes are great contenders.\nCovering important issues\nin mental and physical\nhealth, both these games\nhit me hard in the feels\nalmost as much as\nconcrete genie did.\nGame Direction\n\u201cAwarded for outstanding creative vision\nand innovation in game\ndirection and design.\u201d\nNominees: Control,\nDeath Stranding, Resident\nEvil 2, Sekiro: Shadows\nDie Twice and Outer\nWilds. As much as I\nwant Resident Evil 2 (my\npersonal favourite remake\never) to win this, I feel as\nthough Death Stranding\nis more deserving. The\nability of Hideo Kojima to\nput together all the parts\nof Death stranding into a\ncohesive cinematic gem\nis undeniable, and with\nGeoff Keighly (organiser\nof The Game Awards)\nbeing good friends with\nKojima, I would be surprised if it didn\u2019t win this\naward.\nFighting Game\n\u201cFor the best game\ndesigned primarily around\nhead-to-head combat.\u201d\nNominees: Dead or\nAlive 6, Jump Force,\nMortal Kombat 11,\nSamurai Shodown and\nSuper Smash Bros.\nUltimate. I literally\nsnorted when I saw Jump\nForce nominated for best\nfighting game this year.\nIt has been a mixed year\nfor fighting games, but\nluckily MK 11 and Smash\nare absolute gems. MK\n11 keeps everything the\nfans love about Mortal\nKombat, but the slower\nthan usual gameplay disappointed some. Smash\n\u201cI urge anyone\nwho hasn\u2019t\nheard of\nConcrete Genie\nto pick it up\nand give it a\ngo\u201d\n\u201cAstral chain\nwas a sleeper\nhit and\npersonally I\nfeel it does a\nlot more than\nmany other\nnominees\u201d\nBros. on the other hand has\nno haters. It has over 70\nunique fighters, bringing\nback every fighter and\nalmost every stage from\nprevious games. It has a\n30 hour+ story mode and\nit still gets DLC characters\ndespite 5 already being\nreleased (this is amazing\nfor Nintendo). I would be\namazed if it didn\u2019t win,\nand being my favourite\nfranchise of all time, I\nwould be so happy to see\nit getting the recognition it\ndeserves.\nFamily Game\n\u201cFor the best game appropriate for family play,\nirrespective of genre or\nplatform.\u201d\nNominees: Luigi\u2019s\nMansion 3, Ring Fit\nAdventure, Super Mario\nMaker 2, Super Smash\nBros. Ultimate and\nYoshi\u2019s Crafted World.\nNot much needs to be said\nhere, Super Smash Bros.\nUltimate deserves this,\nhands down. Although,\nit is funny to notice that\nevery nominee is from\nNintendo.\nAction/Adventure\n\u201cFor the best action/ad-venture game, combining\ncombat with traversal and\npuzzle-solving.\u201d\nNominees: Borderlands\n3, Control, Death Stranding, Resident Evil 2, The\nLegend of Zelda: Link\u2019s\nAwakening and Sekiro:\nShadows Die Twice. As\nfar as action/adventure\ngames go, this year\nhas been great. Despite\nlacking many traditional\nfeeling action/adventure\ngames, all the nominees\nhere brought something\nunique to the table.\nBorderlands 3 stands\nout as being a blast from\nstart to finish, but I don\u2019t\nthink it will win. Resident\nEvil 2 and Zelda are both\nremakes so despite being\namazing, I doubt they\nhave much chance either. I\nwould love to see Control\nget some recognition\nas it mainly flew under\nthe radar this year, but I\nhave a feeling that Death\nStranding will also take\nthis just because of how\npopular it seems to be.\nAction Game\n\u201cFor the best game in\nthe action genre \u2013 focused\nprimarily on combat.\u201d\nNominees: Apex\nLegends, Astral Chain,\nCall of Duty: Modern\nWarfare, Devil May Cry\n5, Gears 5 and Metro\nExodus. Man, oh man do\nI want Astral Chain to\nwin this. From the makers\nof Bayonetta, Astral\nChain is 100% action and\ngameplay and I love it. It\nwas a sleeper hit and personally I feel like it does a\nlot more than many of the\nother nominees. I have a\nsinking feeling that Apex\nLegends will win though,\nsimply due to the massive\naudience that it grew, as\nwell as its addictive high-speed gameplay.\nGAME OF THE YEAR\n\u201cRecognising a game\nthat delivers the absolute\nbest experience across\nall creative and technical\nfields.\u201d\nNominees: Control,\nDeath Stranding, Resident\nEvil 2, Sekiro: Shadow\u2019s\nDie Twice, Super Smash\nBros. Ultimate and The\nOuter Worlds.\nThis is the kicker.\nWhat a hard choice.\nSuper Smash Bros. is my\nfavourite series of games\nbut I cannot look pass\nhow much fun I had with\nRE 2, Sekiro or The Outer\nWorlds. Equally, the\ngeneral audience seemed\nvery drawn towards Death\nStranding and control this\nyear. It is very hard but I\nfeel like when considering\nwhich game \u201cdelivers the\nabsolute best experience\nacross all creative and\ntechnical fields\u201d, Resident\nEvil honestly takes the\ncake. Despite being a\nremake, the music, art, direction and gameplay are\nall sublime and I struggle\nto flaw it in any way.\nMy personal pick would\nbe Smash Bros. But I\nhonestly believe this will\nbe the first time a remake\nwins it all.\nGeoff Keighly, the face of the whole event, seen here at last year\u2019s game awards // Variety\n\n"

The\nlast decade of the 20th\ncentury saw the advent of\nAre we headed for a new DotCom Bubble?\nindex. In the span of five\nyears, Nasdaq grew from\njust under 1,000 units in\n1995 to 5,000 in 2000.\nIts peak of 5,048.62 was\nrecorded on March 10th\n,\n2000. Various factors are\nconsidered responsible for\nmaking the bubble finally\npop, including a raise of\ninterest rates by the US\nFederal Reserve along\nwith analysts\u2019 belief that\ninvesting in technology\nsector should no longer be\nprioritised.\nBy March of next year,\nthe US economy had\nentered a recession. Following the tragic events of\nSeptember 2001, the era\nof the dotcom companies\nofficially ended, as no\nInitial Public Offerings\n(IPOs) from technology\nfirms were filed.\nUnderlying Causes of\nthe Crash\nThe most important\nquestion is, what were\nthe underlying causes of\nthe crash? The investing\ncommunity\u2019s persistence\nin pouring money into\nunprofitable Internet start-ups appears as the root of\nthe problem. The astonishing success of firms such\nas Amazon and eBay led\nseveral entrepreneurs to\nbelieving that the creation\nof a web-based company\nwas a path of guaranteed\nsuccess, which explains\nthe overly large number\nof dotcoms entering the\nstock market.\nAspiring wealth-crea-tors were not the only ones\ncaptured by that belief;\nthis sentiment governed\ninvestors\u2019 thinking to a\nlarge degree. Consequently, they began to disregard\nthe basic rules of invest\u201c...astonishing\nsuccess of\nfirms such\nas Amazon\nand eBay\nled several\nentrepreneurs\nto believing\nthat the\ncreation of a\nweb-based\ncompany\nwas a path of\nguaranteed\nsuccess\u201d\nFELIX\nFig 1. Looking at around the year 1999, the NASDAQ leaped from below 3000 to the peak of 5048.62. It has taken 15 years for the NASDAQ to\nrecover to that high. Will history repeat itself? // MarketRealist\ning, including analysing\nbusiness plans and price to\nearnings ratios. Instead of\nfocusing on how start-ups\ncould generate revenue,\nanalysts instead focused\non irrelevant aspects\nof their operation and\nderived unrealistic models\nrelated to future cash flow.\nAs expected, the\noverabundance of capital\nresulted in an unreasonable number of \u201cdotcoms\u201d\ngoing public. In order to\nbecome successful, these\ncompanies sought to\ndifferentiate themselves\nfrom the pack through\nmarketing. It has been\nreported that some\ndevoted more than 90%\nof their budget to adver-tising! This approach\nwas unsustainable as the\nmajority of these firms\nhad yet to form a sustainable business model. Even\nmore astonishing, some\nhad not finalised their\nproducts upon issuing\ntheir IPOs!\nThe combination\nof these tendencies\nconstituted a recipe for\ndisaster. What is perhaps\nmore unfortunate is\nthat certain voices had\nrealised the boom could\nnot be sustained, such as\nAlan Greenspan, the then\nChairman of the Federal\nReserve. He cautioned\nagainst over-investing in\nthe technology sector at\nthe end of 1996. However,\nhis choice to adopt a lax\nmonetary policy until\nearly 2000 was heavily\ncriticised by multiple\nanalysts as it only helped\naccelerate the formation\nof the Dotcom bubble.Ac-cording to their thinking,\na tighter monetary policy\ncould have helped contain\nthe situation.\nWill a new bubble\nburst?\nMany people are also\nwondering, will a new\ntech bubble burst? There\nare definitely signs which\ncould be interpreted as a\nwarning for a new Dotcom\nbubble. Just like in the\n1990s, a large number of\ntech companies are going\npublic with overly high\nvaluations. Some of them\nthe World Wide Web and\nthe Personal Computer.\nThese technological\ndevelopments led to the\ncreation of numerous\nstartups, many of which\nhad a \u201c.com\u201d attached at\nthe end of their name.\nContinuous investment\ninto these companies\nresulted in an exponential\nrise of their equity valuations by the end of the\n1990s. That can be easily\nconfirmed by Figure 1,\ndepicting the variations in\nthe value of the technol-ogy-dominated Nasdaq\n\u201cIt had been\nreported that\nsome devoted\nmore than\n90% of their\nbudget to\nadvertising!\u201d\nhave filed for IPOs despite\nthe fact they have not yet\nbeen able to generate\nprofits.\nFor instance, Survey\nMonkey, a well-known\nbusiness software\ncompany, issued an IPO\nin August of 2018 seeking\nto raise close to $100.\nmillion. In the first half\nof the year, it recorded a\nnet loss of $27.18 million.\nSimilar cases include the\ncloud provider Dropbox\nand the firm DocuSign,\nwhich creates software\nfor digitally signing doc-uments, among others. It\nis also worth noting that\n2018 became a record\n\u201cA large\nnumber of tech\ncompanies\nare going\npublic with\noverly high\nvaluations\u201d\n\n"

Sure to provide you\nwith mind-blowing choreography and amazing\nvocals that will hopefully\ndistract you from that oh-so-awful CGI.\nLITTLE WOMEN: 26th\nDecember\nA remake of the classic\nnovel with Saoirse Ronan,\nEmma Watson, Timothee\nChalamet and Meryl\nStreep. This family drama\nfollows the March sisters\nas they grow up in the\naftermath of the American\nCivil War.\n1917: 10th\nJanuary\nDirected by British\ndirector Sam Mendes\n(American Beauty).\nTwo young soldiers are\nentrusted to deliver news\nto over 1,600 soldiers\nof a deadly attack. With\nOscar buzz surrounding\nit already, something to\nlook out for in this movie\nis how it appears to be one\ncontinuous shot from start\nto finish.\nFestive Favourites\nS\nince it is the\nseason, I thought\nI would make a\nlist of my go-to\nChristmas films for the\nDecember period. They\naren\u2019t going to be ground\nbreaking - I\u2019m sure you\nwill have watched them\nbefore - nor will they be\nfilms I consider impres-sive, however they give\nme that warm festive\nfeeling and get me excited\nfor Christmas. So, if the\nImperial workload is suppressing your Christmas\nspirit, throw one of these\non and you\u2019re bound to\nfeel a bit more merry.\nLOVE ACTUALLY\nLove it or hate it, with\nColin Firth, Hugh Grant,\nAlan Rickman, Emma\nThompson, and many\nmore, you can\u2019t deny it\nhas a killer cast. Even\nthough it\u2019s not really a\nChristmas film, but a ro-mantic-comedy, it really\nis a Christmas classic and\nI doubt you\u2019ll manage to\nsurvive the season in the\nUK without seeing it on\nthe telly at least once.\nHOME ALONE 2: LOST\nIN NEW YORK\nI feel like not many\npeople agree with this,\nbut I definitely favour the\nsecond instalment in the\nHome Alone franchise\nover the first (who even\ncares about the rest?).\nIt has all the fun of the\nfirst film, but is set in\nNew York City, and who\ndoesn\u2019t dream of a Christmas in New York?\nHARRY POTTER\nOf course Harry Potter\nfilms aren\u2019t in anyway\nChristmassy, but I can\u2019t\ndissociate them from\nChristmas. There are few\nthings more comforting\nthan staying in to watch\nHarry Potter on a cold\nwinter\u2019s day and I\u2019m sure\nwe\u2019ve all participated\nin a Harry Potter TV\nmarathon around this time\nof year.\nHOW THE GRINCH\nSTOLE CHRISTMAS\nThis adaptation of the\nclassic story by Dr. Seuss\nhas been a firm Christmas\nfavourite of mine for as\nlong as I can remember.\nMaybe its nostalgia, but\nI love everything about\nthis, from Jim Carrey\u2019s\ninterpretation of the\nGrinch, the songs to the\nWho\u2019s little upturned\nnoses. Personally I don\u2019t\nthink you can be too old to\nenjoy this.\nIT\u2019S AWONDERFUL LIFE\nIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\nis just a brilliant film in\nitself, but with the added\nfestivities, it becomes one\nof my favourites. Growing\nup, my siblings and I had\nthis film forced upon us\nby our parents annually. I\nmay have found it slightly\nfrustrating then, but now I\nfind this story about a man\non the edge of a suicide\nattempt being shown the\nimportance of his life by\nan angel so touching.\nThe Rise of the Skywalker // Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures\nFILM\nJasmin Daley\nFilm Writer\nKevin and his tormentors // 20th\nCentury Fox\nSix films to look out for in the cinema over the Christmas break\nThe little women // Sony Pictures Releasing\nFILM\nCharlotte Arrand\nFilm Editor\n\u2018Tis the season... to forget about your end of term assignments and watch a load of Christmas films\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nMONDAY, 9TH\nDECEMBER, 2019\nTELEVISION tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n40\nBinge of the Week: The Crown (Season 3)\nU\npon the initial\nrelease of the\nfirst season\nback in 2016,\nit was made very clear\nthat the audience should\nnot get too attached to the\ncast, as they would only be\nplaying the Royal Family\nfor the first two seasons.\nHowever, Claire Foy, Matt\nSmith and Vanessa Kirby,\nwho played Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Phillip and\nPrincess Margaret respec-tively, were so incredible\nin their roles that a large\nchunk of the audience,\nincluding me, dreaded to\nreturn to the show with a\ncompletely different cast.\nThree years down\nthe line, Olivia Colman,\nTobias Menzies and\nHelena Bonham Carter\nhave taken over the lead\nroles respectively, and\nthey are absolutely won-derful.\nColman, who was\nannounced to take over\nthe role some months\nbefore her unexpected yet\nwell-deserved Oscar win\nfor playing another queen\nin The Favourite, completely nails her role. It\u2019s\nhonestly weird how she\nfinds a way to sound both\nexactly like the Queen and\nlike Claire Foy at the same\ntime. Most importantly,\nher facial expressions\nare priceless. Each curl\nof her lip, each lift of an\neyebrow conveys feelings\nand messages very\nclearly. It\u2019s honestly quite\nmagnificent. Her take on\nthe Queen is slightly more\nunlikeable compared to\nFoy\u2019s, though, given the\nsource material, seems\njustified to me.\nBonham Carter, who\nhas always been one of\nmy favourite actresses is\nnothing short of magnif-icent. Usually known for\nher more \u2018out-there\u2019 roles\n(Bellatrix Lestrange in\nHarry Potter, Ms. Lovett\nin Sweeney Todd), this\nrole is quite a departure\nfor her. She is absolutely\nmagnetic in her role,\nportraying the eccentric\nprincess with surprising\namount of elegance. A\nvery prominent part of her\narc this season is her bitterness - towards always\nbeing in the queen\u2019s\nshadow, to her lack of\npurpose in life. Unfortunately, though, halfway\ninto the season, Bonham\nCarter sort of disappears,\nnot really having much to\ndo until the final episode\nof the season, which is my\nonly grievance with this\nseason. I just wanted more\nof her, goddammit.\nIt\u2019s no surprise to\nanyone that Colman and\nBonham Carter excelled\nin their roles. However,\nthe real surprise of the\nseason is how magnificent\nJosh O\u2019Connor and Erin\nDoherty are as Prince\nCharles and Princess\nAnne respectively. They\ncapture the young royals\nwith so much emotion\nand poise that it was hard\nto take one\u2019s eyes off\nof them every time they\nwere on the screen. These\nyoung actors may only be\na part of The Crown for\ntwo seasons, but given\nthe amount of sheer skill\nthey demonstrated with\nthis season, I don\u2019t think\nwe\u2019ll have to wait long to\nsee them in more projects\ndown the line.\nOne other thing that\nThe Crown always excels\nin is its cinematography,\nwhich is once again off\nthe charts. Each episode\nlooks and feels like a\nmovie, and an expensive\none at that. Each shot is so\ngorgeous that I wish I was\na royal. Then two minutes\nlater, the show makes\nme realise how shit their\nlives must be despite the\nwealth, the fame and the\npalaces.\nOverall, compared\nto the previous seasons,\nseason 3 of The Crown has\na slower pace. However, it\nis as strong as ever, and I\ngenuinely can\u2019t wait for\nthe next season which\nwill undoubtedly contain\njuicier content, including\nand not limited to the\nintroduction of Princess\nDiana and Margaret\nThatcherintotheequation.\nAlthough the cast change\ntook a second to get used\nto, each member of the\nnew cast has managed\nto perfectly embody the\nreal-life individuals that\nthey so successfully bring\nto our screens.\nThe Crown (Season 3) starring Olivia Colman // Wikimedia\nTELEVISION\nOzbil Ege Dumenci\nTV Editor\nCreator: Peter Morgan\nStarring: Olivia Colma,\nTobias Menzies, Helena\nBonham Carter\nSeason 3\nQuick side note: over\nthe last few weeks, there\nhas been speculation that\nImelda Staunton (Dolores\nUmbridge in Harry\nPotter) was tapped to\nreplace Colman and play\nthe queen in her 60s. This\nrumour has been denied by\nNetflix, but I am holding\nout hope that this comes\nto fruition. Staunton is\nperhaps one of the most\nunderrated actresses of her\ngeneration, mainly known\nfor her role in the Harry\nPotter movies, which she\nexecuted so perfectly that\nhalf the world hates her\nguts. However, given her\nstage credits in the West\nEnd, and my own experiences seeing her live\non stage, she would be a\nperfect fit.\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1737\nFELIX\nTELEVISION tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nBest of the decade: Editor\u2019s choice\nTelevision editor Jia ranks ten of her favourite TV shows of the decade\nC\nhoosing and\nranking the best\nTV shows of the\ndecade might\nhave been the most daunting task especially in the\nera of \u201cPeak TV\u201d where\nevery provider churns out\nquality pieces at an unprecedented rate. But I\u2019ve\nmanaged to narrow the\nlist down to ten. I\u2019m sure\nI have missed many gems,\nand this list is not the most\nobjective (I do have a soft\nspot for comedies), but\nhere we go:\n1. Fleabag (2016 -2019)\nFleabag as previously\nmentioned is undoubtedly\nmy favourite show of\nall time. What Phoebe\nWaller-Bridge has created\ncan only be described\nas a masterpiece - every\nsecond of it delivers something unexpected. The\nway it breaks the fourth\nwall is a necessary touch\nbut also incorporates the\nsort of ambiguity that I\nthought was exclusive to\nliterature - each sentence\ncarries a different weight.\nYou get to delve deep into\nthe character\u2019s mind while\nthe narrative continues.\nIf there\u2019s a textbook on\nthe history of television\nshows, I firmly believe\nthat Fleabag deserves its\nown section.\n2. Breaking Bad (2008\n- 2013)\nI went in for the\npremise of high-school-chemistry-teacher-turned-drug-dealer (honestly who\nwouldn\u2019t?), and little did I\nknow what I was in a ride\nfor. I can\u2019t even pinpoint\nthe best part of the show\nbecause every aspect is\nsimply perfect. Very few\nshows have managed\nto achieve this level of\ncharacter development\nto the point that the first\nand last seasons feel like\nthey belong to two completely different shows,\nyet the plot moves so\nnaturally and builds such\na convincing backstory.\nEvery episode leaves you\npondering where it will go\nnext. It also takes brilliant\nacting to bring life to the\ncomplex characters. In\nshort, AMC\u2019s Breaking\nBad lives up to its hype\nas \u201cone of the greatest TV\nshows of all time.\u201d\n3. The World Between\nUs (2019)\nI hesitated for a\nmoment whether to\ninclude HBO Asia\u2019s The\nWorld Between Us in\nthis list - but I figured I\nhad to for its impact on\nthe Asian TV scene. It is\na Taiwanese series that\nexplores the aftermath of\na mass shooting, skillfully\nintertwining perspectives\nof all parties involved. It\nholds a special spot in my\nheart - my buckets of tears\nare all the evidence you\nneed. The characters are\nexquisitely crafted; the\ndialogues are written and\ndelivered with such emotional precision. I want to\napplaud the show creators\nfor their brutally honest\ntake on the uneasy topics\nof morality, mass-killing,\nhuman rights, and mental\nhealth. It\u2019s certainly the\nTaiwanese show of the\ndecade.\n4. Sherlock (2010 -2017)\nBBC\u2019s Sherlock is the\nmodern take on Sir Arthur\nConan Doyle\u2019s Sherlock\nHolmes detective stories,\nand it\u2019s the perfect balance\nbetween old and new. It\u2019s\na rather difficult task to put\na twist on a well-known\nclassic, but Steven Moffat\nand Mark Gatiss execute it\nflawlessly, staying faithful\nto its source material\nwhile adding a refreshing and inventive flare.\nBenedict Cumberbatch\u2019s\nand Martin Freeman\u2019s\nsuperb acting bring life to\nthe classic duo. Although\nthe last season falls short\nof my expectations, I still\nregard it as one of my\nfavourites of the decade\nfor its witty lines and\nimpeccable chemistry.\n5. Westworld (2016 -Present)\nDiving into Westworld\nI was initially uncertain\nabout the cliche AI\nuprising trope, but thankfully it did not disappoint\n- setting it in a western\ntheme park is kind of a\ngenius move. The highlight for me is definitely\nthe visual stimulation - be\nit the meticulous special\neffects or the set design.\nUndeniably Westworld is\nmultilayered and fascinat-ingly explored, brought\nout by its critically acclaimed cast. For all the\nviolence and misogyny,\nWestworld still remains\nwithin the acceptable\nboundaries and nevertheless presents an interesting case of humans losing\nhumanity and androids\ngaining it.\n6. The Marvelous\nMrs. Maisel (2017 -Present)\nThis period-drama\ncomedy is set in 1950\u2019s\nManhattan centered\naround Miriam \u201cMidge\u201d\nMaisel (played by\nRachel Brosnahan),\nan upper-class Jewish\nAmerican housewife\nwho\u2019s pursuing a career\nin stand up comedy after\nher husband has an affair\nand leaves her. It\u2019s simple,\ndelightful, energetic and\nhas an upbeat optimism\nthat puts a smile on my\nspace any day. There\u2019s a\ncheerful elegance to the\nfifties tied in with the universal theme of a woman\nfinding her own voice that\nmakes the show work.\n7. Modern Family\n(2009 - Present)\nModern Family is a\nmockumentary capturing\nthe trials and tribulations\nof the Pritchett families,\nthree very different yet\ninterconnected families.\nAlthough I have to admit\nthat there is a decline in\nthe later seasons, it\u2019s still\nneurotic, hilarious, and\nheartfelt. It\u2019s also very\nreflective of a typical\nAmerican family and is\ndecade-characteristic,\nwhich was why I related\nthe show in the first\nplace when I moved to\nthe States. It\u2019s the sort of\n\u201cpick-me-up\u201d or \u201cfeelgood\u201d show that\u2019s a staple\non everyone\u2019s rewatch\nlist.\n8. The Big Bang Theory (2007 - 2019)\nThe twelve-year run\nThe Big Bang Theory tells\nthe story of two CalTech\nphysicists and their new\nneighbor next door. While\nmany cite an inconsistency in the quality of\neach season, it finished\nwith a strong ending\nthat beautifully wraps\nup the twelve seasons.\nThe geeky dynamics and\nnerdy references were\nnicely played out (except\nwhen the writers fell into\nthe trap of stereotyping).\nNonetheless, this show\nhas accompanied me\nthrough many stages of\nlife and can be framed as\na decade-defining sitcom.\n9. Killing Eve (2018 -Present)\nHere we have yet\nanother gem from Phoebe\nWaller-Bridge. Killing\nEve is a thrilling cat-and-mouse tale between MI6\noperative Eve Polastri\n(played by Sandra Oh)\nand psychopathic assassin\nVillanelle (played by Jodie\nComer). There\u2019s unbelievable chemistry between\nthe pair that defines the\nshow. Every aspect - plot,\ncharacter development,\nset design, costume\ndesign, cinematography\n- is simply excellent.\nUnquestionably WallerBridge has mastered the\nart of storytelling.\n10. Chernobyl (2019)\nHBO\u2019s Chernobyl is\na five-part miniseries\nbased on the catastrophic 1986 nuclear accident\nin Chernobyl. It\u2019s grip-ping, disheartening, painfully honest, and can be\nbest summarised with the\nquestion \u201cWhat is the cost\nof lies?\u201d Its focus on humans is what sets it apart\nfrom other documentaries and what makes it all\nthe more horrifying and\nblunt. It\u2019s era-defining,\nparadigm-shifting, and\nwell-deserved of its nineteen Emmy nominations.\nIt\u2019s a story that needed to\nbe told, and I\u2019m glad HBO\nfound the right people to\ntell the story.\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge is transcendent both as a writer and an actress in Fleabag // Amazon Prime\nTELEVISION\nJia Qi Tan\nTelevision Editor\n\n"

This is about what\nwe want to be doing just\nas much as what we don\u2019t\nwant to be doing. While\nwe are certainly aiming\nfor full divestment, I feel\nthere are other options\nthan just to divest or to not\ndivest \u2013 there are options\nB, C, D, E, and F that\nother institutions, such as\nMIT, have done.\u201d\nCurrently, the College\nhas millions invested in\nfossil fuel companies,\ntotalling to \u00a38.9 million\nas of 2017, as well often\ninvesting in other industries that have ethical\nimplications such as arms\nor tobacco.\nThe working group is\ncomprised of members\nof College Council,\nincluding the Union President, the Chief Financial\nOfficer, the Provost, the\nDean of the Business\nSchool, and an elected\nstaff representative. It\ndoes not include the\nEthics and Environment\nOfficer, who was one of\nthe authors of the original\npaper. The group will be\nconsulting with external\nexperts and stakeholders,\nas well as accepting submissions for consideration\nfrom staff and students\nprior to January 31st (see\nend of article for more\ninformation.)\nAbhijay said of his\ninvolvement that \u201cit is one\nof the most meaningful\nworking groups in which\nI\u2019m involved, because it\nhas a clear remit and is\ngoing to report back on a\nspecific date.\u201d\nIn the case of the paper,\nthe aim is not necessarily\ndivestment, but rather\nto open discussion. As\nFrancesca said, \u201cmy\nperspective is that there\nweren\u2019t many really constructive discussions that\nwere happening between\nstudents and senior lead-ership, and that was our\nessentially aim of this\npaper\u201d. The complexities\nof social responsibility\noften pose difficult questions with regards to\n\u2018drawing the line\u2019.\nThis was recently\nhighlighted when an\ninternal email sent by Ann\nMuggeridge, the Chair of\nPetroleum Engineering\nat Imperial, to the rest of\nthe academic section was\nleaked, which described\ndivestment from fossil\nfuels as a \u201csimplistic reaction to a very complex\nproblem\u201d and encouraged\ncolleagues to consider\n\u201chow we can best articulate the importance\nof our research in both\nmitigating the impact\nEthical Investment Paper Passed by College Council\nISSUE 1737\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA paper presented to College Council by the Union President on establishing a Socially Responsible Investment\nPolicy working group was passed on 22nd November\n\u201cWe want to\ndiscuss our\nbeliefs and\nvalues as a\nuniversity,\nand how that\nimpacts what\nwe do\u201d\ntalking points and tactics\nof the global fossil fuel\nindustry to undermine an\ninternal College process,\nespecially one which has\nstrong support from the\nstaff and student body.\nThat they must resort to\nslyly persuading their colleagues that fossil fuels are\nbeneficial to society when\nwe know they are accelerating climate breakdown\nis just embarrassing and\ndemonstrates a blatant\nlack of scientific integrity\n\u2026 This leak should stand\nas a sign for those who\nsupport divestment that if\nwe don't fight for it now,\nvested interests within the\nCollege will block it.\u201d\nSpeaking to Ann, she\nsaid that her aim was to\n\u201cmake sure that everyone\nhas their view represented\nwithin the considerations\nof the working group. It\u2019s\nfreedom of speech here.\u201d\nShe further clarified that\nthis is inclusive of people\nwithin the section who\ndo agree that investment\nin fossil fuels is socially\nirresponsible. Her personal perspective is that\nworking with fossil fuel\ncompanies is necessary for\ndevelopment of sustain-ability-focused practices\nsuch as carbon capture and\ngeological storage, which\nare essential for reducing\ncarbon dioxide emissions\nwhile renewable energy\ntechnologies are devel-oped. She clarified that\nshe believes divestment\nwould be discourteous,\nand could make it more\ndifficult to work with\nfossil fuel companies to\ndeploy vital technology.\nThere has been growing\npressure for College\nto address the issue of\nethical investment from\nboth external and internal\nsources. In particular, the\ncampaign group Divest\nImperial has been highly\nactive, having staged\ndemonstrations \u2013 including one with around 200\npeople on the Queen\u2019s\nLawn on 29th November,\nin partnership with the\nUCU \u2013 gathered hundreds\nof signatures for petitions\nand open letters, and\nmet with senior College\nmanagement several\ntimes. They, along with\nFrancesca, have also been\ninvolved in organising a\nrecent Climate Assembly, which played host\nto guest speakers, ran\nworkshops, and opened\nthe floor to students and\nstaff to discuss and voice\nconcerns. Another is\nscheduled for early next\nyear, with provision of\nsupport from the Union.\nIt is also a topic on\nwhich the Union has been\nmandated to act for over\ntwo years; however, little\ntraction has been gained.\nPart of the reason for that\nhas been a degree of reticence from the College;\nhowever, Abhijay also\npoints to the Union itself:\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my predecessors thought that this\nwas a priority or thought\nabout it enough to think\nof a way to constructively\nmove forward.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a testament to\nwhat you can do when you\nstand firm and don\u2019t blink,\nwhen you think about\nhow to get a discussion\ngoing and open doors,\nbecause there are people\nwho would not want this\nto have been brought\nforward.\u201d\nSubmissions to the\nSRI working group will\ninitially be written, but\na subset of early submissions will be chosen for a\nfurther oral presentation.\nThe contact email is sri.\npolicy@imperial.ac.uk.\n\u201cThis leak\nshould stand\nas a sign that if\nwe don't fight\nfor it, vested\ninterests in the\nCollege will\nblock it\u201d\nof burning fossil fuels\nwhilst providing essential\nraw materials and energy\nto societies around the\nworld.\u201d\nInitially, this was identified as internal lobbying\nto oppose ethical investment on behalf of factions\nwith vested interest within\nthe College, prompting the\nDivest Imperial campaign\nto offer the statement:\n\u201cWe at Divest are\ndisappointed, but sadly\nnot surprised, that these\nresearchers immediately\nfelt it necessary to use the\n3\nThe College Council // Thomas Angus, Imperial College London\n\n"

    "content": "The greatest play in the\nhistory of the world\nThe Arrival: Two Brothers\nReunited\nA\nman wakes in\nthe middle of\nthe night to\ndiscover that\nthe world has stopped. It\nwas exactly 04:40. The\ntitle, intriguing and vague,\nleaves you wondering\nwhat the greatest play in\nthe history of the world\ncould possibly be.\nThe Greatest Play\nin the History of the\nWorld written by Ian\nKershaw and directed by\nRax Shaw is performed\nby a single actor, Julie\nHesmondhalgh, through\nmonologue alone. I was\nquite impressed how\none actor managed to\ndeliver a full seventy\nminutes of a play single\nhandedly. When I arrived\nat Trafalgar studios, I\nwas surprised to find an\nintimate theatre consisting\nof very few rows. It was a\ntrue story-telling experience with the audience\nhuddled around, listening\nto what happens next.\nThis made for a deeply\npersonal experience since\nyou could lock eyes with\nHesmondhalgh herself.\nFurthermore, she interacted with the audience\ndirectly which lets you get\nvery absorbed in the play.\nThe creativity in the\nprops used was clever, she\ntold various stories using\nshoes and their boxes\nalone. Hesmondhalgh\nborrows the audience\u2019s\nshoes to aid her sto-ry-telling which is quite\nunique. The background\nwallpaper consisted of\nglittering sparkles and so\nyou felt like you were in\na different world entirely.\nHesmondhalgh was also\nimpressively funny. It is\nusually very difficult to\nmake me laugh however\nHesmondhalgh\u2019s connection with the audience\nmade it easy.\nMy main criticism of\nthe show is that the plot\ncan be quite confusing\nand the language used can\nbe difficult to follow. Kershaw\u2019s play alludes to the\nvoyager through the play\nand parallels Carl Sagan\u2019s\nuniversal messages on\nthe voyager to love. The\nallusion to the voyager\nwas clear however the\nplot itself surrounding this\nfrozen time around the\nmain characters was hard\nto follow. Potentially I\nmay not have the appreciation for it since it seemed\nmore aimed at others\nin the world of acting.\nHowever, the creativity\nin the set overpowers the\nconfusion and I left with\nmy heart warmed by the\ndelivery. Hesmondhalgh\u2019s\nglow also carries you\npleasantly throughout the\nplay. Although it may\nnot have been the greatest\nplay in the history of the\nworld, I understand the\nreason for its name and\nappreciated the talent\nshowcased in the play. S\namad (Irfan\nShamji) and Tom\n(Scott Karim)\nhave lived very\ndifferent lives. Different\nupbringings, different\nparents, different friends,\ndifferent schools. Social,\ngeographic and cultural\nbarriers have divided\nthem for over thirty years.\nBut they have one thing in\ncommon, they are broth-ers, despite only meeting\nfor the first time as adults.\nAt first they think they\naren\u2019t so different but as\nthey grow closer and try\nto integrate into each other\u2019s lives, they both soon\nrealise things aren\u2019t going\nto be as simple as they had\nhoped.\nTom was adopted at\nbirth, whilst Samad was\nraised by their biological\nparents. Tom tracked\ndown his brother in the\nhopes of establishing\nthe bond that he felt was\nmissing his whole life.\nThe pair are undoubtedly\ndifferent - Tom is brash,\nenthusiastic and eager to\nfeel a sense of belonging\nin the family he thought\nhe didn\u2019t have. But he is\nalso alien and unfamiliar\nto Samad\u2019s bookish,\nsofter and more pampered\nmiddle class lifestyle -withhisCambridgedegree\nand close-knit family unit.\nSamad, initially equally\nenthusiastic, starts to\nregress as their lives\nbecome more intertwined.\nHe seems threatened by\nthis new presence. What\nworks at the start slowly\nstarts to break down over\nthe course of this pacy\n70-minute play, and the\ncracks start to show as\nfamily secrets are uncov-ered.\nSome things confused\nme - the backstory of why\nTom was adopted was\nhinted at but never quite\nexplained. However, the\nmarvel of the play in itself\nalong with the chemistry\nbetween Shamji and\nKarim made up for such\ndiscrepancies. Although\nI wanted more informa-tion, perhaps the cryptic\nwriting by Sheibani was\nintentional - it made the\naudience really focus\non the current actions\nand the beautifully raw\nperformances of Shamji\nand Karim, who expertly\nrevealed their vulnerability and pain.\nWhat really stood out to\nme were the non-verbal,\nchoreographed sections of\nthe play. Special mention\nmust go to the movement\ndirector, Aline David.\nChanges between scenes\nwere filled with meaning\nas the brothers imitate,\nchase one another, dance,\nchange clothes, battle.\nSamal Blak\u2019s designed\na very apt setting - a\ncircular revolving stage\nthat facilitates these scene\nchanges. David often\npits the brothers against\neach other, either facing\ninwards to each other or\nmimicking one another.\nI loved these moments;\nit gave a fluid feel to the\nwhole performance, and\noften the actions spoke\nlouder than the words.\nThis taut family drama\nprovides a superb exposition of loyalty, discovery,\nloss, belonging, and\nbetrayal. The price is\nreasonable for what you\nget, and the tickets are\ncheaper if you\u2019re under\n26. Delicate and complex\nin both the writing and\nperforming, I commend\nall those involved and\nhighly recommend this\nplay.\nLong-lost brothers, reunited // Marc Brenner\nA deeply personal experience // Wikimedia\nISSUE 1737\nFELIX\n27\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nDeniz Ak\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Felix spoke with Anne about the archives and their role in the College\u2019s\noperation\nNEWS\nHenry Alman\nEditor-in-Chief\nFelix: Most students\nprobably aren\u2019t\nreally aware that the\ncollege has archives\n\u2013 do you interact\nwith students a lot?\nSome of them are \u2013 particularly the constituent\ncollege unions \u2013 and I do\nhost evenings with different groups. When I had\nthe City and Guilds Union\nmembers in, they were\nlooking at their past pub-lications, and they were\nfascinated to see what\nwas acceptable to write\nin the past that perhaps\nwouldn\u2019t be so now. But\nthey were sensible about\nit, and they understand\nthe context. You need to\nunderstand the context\nof the time and history\nis history; you can't and\nyou shouldn't attempt to\nchange history - but you\nshould learn from it.\nWhat we do in the archive\nis reflect the history of\nthe College and people\u2019s\nexperience here \u2013 so\nit doesn't matter what\nthe thing is, it could be\nas simple as meeting\nminutes, I like people to\nbring me things!\nFelix: When you talk\nabout having groups\nin, what does that\nexperience look like?\nWe bring them into the\nresearch room and bring\nthe materials they need\nto them \u2013 which aren\u2019t\nalways the things they\noriginally asked for!\nOften their needs change\nas their research does and\npeople don\u2019t always know\nthe right thing to look for;\nwe need to interpret their\nneeds and use our expertise to figure out where\nthey should look to find\ntheir answers.\nWhen student groups\ncome in it\u2019s usually\nfocused around their own\ndeposits of their records,\nlike the RCSU\u2019s Broadsheet or minute books\nfrom old meetings. We\nhold onto those things for\nthem, having the expertise\nto manage it and the space\nto store it, but it belongs\nto them. As to access\nfor research, we need to\nknow what people want\nexactly in order to assist\nthem to what they need,\nwhich isn\u2019t always what\nthey may ask for. We\nneed to drill down to their\nreal question, and this is\nunique material, so we\nhave to supervise them\nusing it. We will provide\nthings digitally if request-ed, but don\u2019t allow people\nto take pictures when\nthey come in \u2013 because,\nfor example, a lot of our\narchive is copyrighted.\nWe are open to internal\nand external researchers.\nFelix: Something that\nwas raised to me by\none of the constituent unions, the CGCU,\nwas that Imperial as\nan institution feels as\nif it is phasing out its\nown history at times\n\u2013 does that ring true\nfor you?\nI think there was this\nnotion that constituent\nunions would become\n\u2018chapters\u2019, so people felt\nthat downgraded them.\nMy view is: Imperial is\nso big now that you really\nneed to feel like you\nbelong to something. I\nactually think constituent\ncollege unions are really\nimportant, to make people\nfeel like there is something they can get hold\nof, that they can do their\npart in, rather than a big\nnebulous thing.\nFelix: Do you think\nthe STEM focus here\nleads people to\ndisregard the history of the College at\ntimes \u2013 operating in a\n\u2018bubble\u2019?\nNot necessarily. I think\nthat people are very, very\nbusy, and that there\u2019s\nmasses more knowledge\nnow than there used to\nbe and so there\u2019s masses\nmore to learn. Courses\nare very, very intensive.\nSo people don't have\nthe capacity to do what\nstudents used to do, and\nthat sort of freedom\nrather than anything else.\nBut students and other\nsections of College use\nour services a great deal.\nFelix: What sort of\nchallenges do you\nface in your role? I\nwould think College\u2019s\nexpansion over the\nyears would make\nthings harder!\nIt does make things\nslightly harder in terms\nof volume. We try to\nencompass as much as\nwe can. But within that,\nwe aren\u2019t looking back,\nbut are rather looking\nforward. We need to know\nwhat\u2019s happening now,\nand we need to know what\nis going to happen, in\norder to make sure we get\nin contact with the right\npeople to obtain and retain\nimportant documents - so\nour work is very forward\nthinking, not so much\nbackward as people might\nexpect.\nThe electronic expansion\nhas also meant there\u2019s\nmasses more to find. Email\nespecially is a challenge\nfor everybody! There is a\nlot of material in emails,\nand nobody globally has\ncome up with a solution\nfor keeping and sifting\nthrough all that material.\nHuman nature makes it\nhard \u2013 when people use a\nparticular email headline,\nthey don\u2019t stick to that\ntopic; the conversation\nmoves onto other matters.\nIf everyone was very\ndisciplined and wrote\nproper titles or subjects\nand switched email chains\nwhen discussing something else, it\u2019d be much\neasier to manage for them.\nI think one of the biggest\nchallenges for the future is\nAnne Barrett, the College archivist // Thomas Angus, Imperial College London\n\n"

Some observers\nhad initially speculated\nthat this economic reality would drive urchins\nto vote for Labour in\ndroves, but this has yet\nto materialise, partly\nbecause robust child\nworker laws would render the majority of the\ncontingent unemployed.\nConservative policies\nwhich are thought to be\nmost damaging include\nthe removal of subsidies\nfor workers in the chimney\ncleaning industry, an\nincreased police presence\nin Whitechapel, and a\nblanket ban on unlicensed\nshoe-shining.

One of\nthe biggest issues that\nDickensian urchins face\nis adapting to changes in\nthe labour market. After\nthe recent closure of Fizzlenack\u2019s Opera Hat Co.\nmany former employees\nwere turned away from\nnew jobs, with many surprised to learn that being\n\u201csharp as a thistle, clean\nas a whistle\u201d was not sufficient as a transferrable\nskill. Workplace etiquette\nis also sometimes lost on\nurchins, with potential\nbosses saying they felt\n\u201cuncomfortable\u201d with\nbeing referred to as a\n\u201cguvnor\u201d.\nFor many, the woes of\nthe street urchins are not a\ncause for concern. Among\nthese are stockbrokers,\nwho celebrated the FLI\n(Flat Cap Index) being up\n96 points at market close\nthe day the poll results\nwere released.

    "content": "but unfortunately do\nnot stimulate too much\nof a narrative. The first\ncommon point is the\nmotive of the human\neye as the prism through\nwhich we perceive the\n(sur)real. On Dali\u2019s side,\nthe example of this is an\nobvious one - Un Chien\nAndalou. The contrast\nbetween the shocking\nvisuals in Dali\u2019s short\nfilm collaboration with\nBu\u00f1uel and Magritte\u2019s\ndepction of an eye on a\ncircular canvas could not\nbe starker. Dali\u2019s version\nof surrealism constantly\nteeters on the borderline\nof the violent (see also\nvulgar and vexing),\nwhile Magritte\u2019s is more\ntoned down. Over time,\nDali\u2019s work became less\nfreely associative, and\nMagritte\u2019s became more\ndaring.\nIn the obsession\nto unearth what lies\nunderneath the surface\nSurrealist Superstars\nMagritte and Dali are two of the biggest names of the Surrealist movement, which changed the art world with\nits daring incorporation of the subconscious into artistic themes in the mid-20th century. You can now see the\ncombined highlights of their works\nB\nrussels\u2019s Place\nRoyale is a\nmecca of art,\nlike a small,\nart-oriented brother to\nthe museums surrounding\nour beautiful campus.\nThe Royal Museums that\nflank it comprise some\nof the finest works of the\nEuropean canon, from\nthe Flemish masters to\nthe modern genius of\nMagritte. The latter\u2019s\npersonal museum quickly\nbecame a favourite of\nmine when I discovered\nit last year, and it was\nalready back then that\na single painting by\nDali amongst the sea of\nMagritte\u2019s works piqued\nmy interest.\nSaint Anthony, naked\nand ragged, kneels on one\nside of the canvas, confronted with fantastically\nvulgar beasts symbolising\nthe devil\u2019s temptations.\nA white horse heads this\nprocession, seemingly\nkept at bay by nothing but\nthe cross that the naked\nsaint is brandishing above\nhis head. The proportions\nare horrifying. The horse\nseemstobeatoncerighton\ntop of poor old Tony, and\nat the same time his hind\nlegs are far behind him,\nspindly and grotesque.\nBut the gangly legs look\neven more terrifying on\nthe elephants following\nin his wake. These carry\nbeautiful naked women,\npalaces, an obelisk, and\nwhat appears to be a\nminaret. It is certainly a\nvery striking image but\nmore than that, it sheds\nlight on some of the obsessions that both artists\nshared: the little window\nframing a woman\u2019s body,\nthe magnificent clouds,\nthe masterful and lifelike\nrendering. Like many\nof Dali\u2019s most poignant\nworks, it is situated in the\ndesert under a mesmeris-ing blue sky. This stark\nblue was flashing in my\nmind as I made my way\nto see Dali x Magritte, the\nexhibition commemorat-ingtenyearsoftheBelgian\nSurrealist master\u2019s very\n\u201cthe obsession\nto unearth\nwhat lies\nunderneath\nthe surface\nof everyday\nreality\u201d\nown museum.\nThe wide avenues of\nBrussels are perfect for\ncontemplation, especially with the sky above\nlooking like freshly mixed\nconcrete. With some time\nto kill before my scheduled slot, I lazily made\nmy way down Avenue\nLouise, thinking long and\nhard about the music that\nwould befit the vibe of\nthe exhibition. In the end\nI mixed myself a punch-bowl of The Doors and\nPink Floyd. I was happy\nwith my choice.\nAs an introduction, the\ncurators treated the mu-seumgoers with a digital\ntake on a painting that\nheld great significance\nfor Magritte\u2019s foray\ninto surrealism, and the\nrelationship between the\ntwo artists. Threatening\nWeather was painted as\nMagritte was visiting Dali\non the coast of the Mediteranean, along with some\nof the other surrealist\nbigshots. Mingling with\nDali\u2019s then wife, Georgette, as well as his future\nwife, Gala, accompanied\nby Paul Eluard, gave\nMagritte inspiration to\nre-evaluate the role of representation in his works. A\ntuba, a naked female torso,\nand a chair float above\nthe coast of Cadaques in\ncloud form in the original\nwork, and likewise in the\ninstallation. They morph\ninto existence slowly from\nordinary clouds, giving\nus a rather simplistic and\nawkward but nevertheless\ninteresting insight into\nhow the artists first tapped\ninto the surrealist vein.\nThe exhibition then\nproceeds through sections\noutlining the differences\nand similarities of both\nartists\u2019 approaches. These\nare divided methodically\nthe objects smooth and\nluscious but at the same\ntime shocking. The Spaniard\u2019s ability to entice\nwith the beauty of his\ncolour palette and brush-strokes, while at the same\ntime horrifying us with\nhis imagery, makes him\nunique. On the subject\nof dreams, Magritte did\nnot believe in their portrayal as an entry into the\nsurreal, while Dali freely\ntapped into his Freudian\ninspirations (perhaps\ndue to his Oedipal ob-sessions). They also both\nhad a penchant for using\nwriting in their art. Be it\nMagritte\u2019s \u2018Ceci n\u2019est pas\nune pipe\u2019, French for \u2018This\nis not a pipe\u2019, or Dali\u2019s\nThe Enigma of Desire/\nMy mother, My mother,\nMy mother, they both\nused words to add a new\ndimension. \u2018In a painting,\nwords have the same\nsubstance as images\u2019,\nMagritte claimed.\nPerhaps the most important uniting aspect for\nboth artists is the incredible fame that they both\nreaped. Dali\u2019s ridiculous\ncurvature of moustache\nsitting above one of his\nquotes and Magritte\u2019s pipe\nare both staples of gallery\nshops around the world.\nWhether one approves\nof Dali\u2019s extravagant\nlifestyle and questionable politics, no one can\ndispute the impact that\nboth artists\u2019 popularity\nhad for others following\nthem. Both had unprecedented success across the\nAtlantic, and the impact\nthat the movement they\nspearheaded between the\nwars had on art following\nthe Second World War\ncannot be understated.\nThey were two of the first\ntruly global art superstars,\nand that in itself is an\nachievement.\nLa Magie Noire, Ren\u00e9 Magritte // Fine Arts Museum\nBrussels\nISSUE 1737\nFELIX\n25\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nMartin Flerin\nArts Writer\nWhere?

One\nsuch project is the Space\nSharing Programme,\nsponsored by Chris\nBanks, the Director of\nLibrary Services and\nAssistant Provost (Space).\nThe programme aims\nto investigate the potential\nfor sharing space between\ndepartments and faculties within the College,\nwhen space is not being\nused by a department, it\nshould be available for\nuse by somebody else,\nwhether for teaching,\nmeetings, conferences, or\nstudent study space. The\ncurrent system means\nthat each department\nowns and manages its\nown space with a very\nhigh degree of agency,\nwhich is then often inaccessible to others. Sharing\npotentially addresses the\nspace shortage problem,\nand recent investment\nin teaching spaces is\nbeginning to address the\ndisparity of quality of\navailable space.\nWhile the potential\nbenefits are clear, there\nare also drawbacks\nand concerns from the\ndepartmental side. For\nexample, should a space\nbe shared, whose responsibility is it to clean it up,\nto maintain it, or to pay\nto replace equipment?\nThe programme seeks to\naddress these concerns\nby establishing behavioural expectations or\nstandards with regard to\nroom sharing and usage;\nhowever, gaining \u2018mutual\nbuy-in\u2019 from departments\nhas been a challenge,\nwhich is needed to get this\ntype of project started. As\nChris puts it, \u201csharing is\ncaring\u201d.\nOne example includes\nconstruction plans for\nWhite City, in which a\ncolossal joint basement\nfloor was proposed which\nwould connect through\nmultiple buildings and\ndepartments as a linked\nspace, available for\nlearning, meeting, exams,\nevents and the like.\nThe plan was not taken\nforward, and instead each\nbuilding is a separate\nentity; the opportunity\nfor shared space was not\nfollowed through.\nThere are two major\nongoing projects as part\nof the programme: one on\ndata collection, dubbed\n\u2018Occupancy Insights\u2019,\nwhich tracks WiFi connections throughout the\nCollege to determine\nroom usage; and another\non developing and implementing a new system for\nroom bookings.\nOccupancy Insights\nis still in an early implementation stage, with\nonly a few people from\nacross the College having\naccess to the growing data\nset. The project is being\ntaken slowly, as there is\na concern with the data\nmight be misinterpreted\nor used to \u2018name and\nshame\u2019 people for un-der-utilisation of space.\nChris stressed that this is\nnot the aim \u2013 the idea is to\ngain solid data on usage to\ninform decision making\nand planning, which is an\narea the College needs to\nimprove on at a wide and\nholistic level.\nThe data has many\npotential uses. It can show\nwhether a large space\nis being booked for too\nfew students, or whether\nspace is being booked\nout for too long \u2013 such as\nblocking out three hours\nfor seminars that end after\nonly two. On the more\nnuanced level, it can shed\nlight on whether the utili-sation gap \u2013 the 13% difference between current\nutilisation and the goal\nof 35% - is actually more\nreasonable than it first\nappears. For example, the\nwind tunnel in the Roderic\nHill building takes up a\ncolossal amount of space\nand will only play host to\na small amount of people\nat once, even though it\nprovides high value.\nIt can also help to\noptimise timetabling \u2013 if,\nhypothetically, there is\nheavy underutilisation in\n9-10am slots, it might be\npossible to expand student\nnumbers and just schedule\nmore lectures, labs, and\ntutorials in 9-10am slots.\nThe data is also aiding\nChris in supporting the bid\nfor converting basement\nspace in the library, which\ncould accommodate a\nlarge group study area\nfor an extra 200 students.\nThe data has also been\nused recently to determine\nthe effectiveness of a fire\nevacuation drill.\nThere is also a long-term intent to use the data\nset for modelling purposes\n\u2013 if the College can predict\nthe effect of planned\nchanges to curriculums,\nor more ambitiously the\nflow of students around\nhypothetical White City\nconstruction plans, then\nit allows for optimisation\nbefore issues even arise.\nThe room booking\nsystem revitalisation is\nalso aimed at smoothing\nprocesses across depart-ments. Currently, the\nhigh agency of faculties\nand their ownership\nof space has led to the\ndevelopment of at least\n13 different systems\nacross the College for\nroom booking and related\nprocesses, each used exclusively within a limited\nrange of departments or\nbuildings. This makes\nspace sharing virtually\nimpossible. Additionally,\nmost of those systems\nhave human elements as a\nfundamental component,\nand are often administered\nvia email. Chris describes\nit as a \u201cnoisy process\u201d;\none that is frustrated by\nhuman error, in which\nvisibility and accessibility\nare limited, and which\ncollapses as soon as an individual goes on holiday.\nThere are also regular\nproblems with dou-ble-booking through\ndifferent sources, as\ntwo different programs\nare used to book for\nteaching purposes and\nfor conferencing and\nevents \u2013 CELCAT and\nKX, respectively. Each of\nthese can be used to book,\nbut bookings from each\ncan overlap. A systems\nfix for this would be expensive and would incur\na large technical debt,\nand so again the focus is\non establishing protocol\nchanges that may ensure\nproblems such as dou-ble-booking do not arise.\nHowever, the potential\nlong-term end-goal is\nmuch more ambitious.\nThe aim is to explore\nthe development of a\n\u2018one-stop shop\u2019 system,\nin which every room in\nCollege is visible and\nbookable. Additionally, it\nwould feature the ability\nto search for free rooms\nbased on certain criteria,\nsuch as facilities in the\nroom or size. Chris also\nadded: \u201cmy end goal is\nabsolutely to get more\nrooms viewable and\nbookable by students as\nwell\u201d, for study purposes.\nShe also mentioned that\nJames Medler, the former\nDPCS who developed the\nnew interface for room\nbookings for the Union,\nis working on the project\n\u2013 creating visualisations\nof how the different room\nbooking systems across\nthe College currently\ninterconnect.\nOne of the problems\nwith long-term projects at\nthe College is managing to\neffectively communicate\nwith students. Although\nconsultations may be\nrun, the student turnover\nyear-on-year often means\nthat most of a current\ncohort remain unaware\nof any improvements and\nchanges being worked on,\nleading to frustration.\nChris said: \u201cWe\u2019re\naware of the potential for\ninformation overload, so\nwe need to choose the\npointatwhichwereengage\n\u2013 either for further consultation or to inform people\nthat something is actually\nhappening. If there is a\nbig clamour, \u2018why is no\none doing anything about\nX\u2019, I\u2019d certainly like to be\nable to say we are doing\nsomething about it. The\ninformation is there. But\nbalancing the communications with timeliness,\nwith everything else that\u2019s\ngoing on and everything\nwe have got to deliver,\nis difficult. We want to\ndeliver \u2013 but we can\u2019t just\nflick a switch.\u201d\n\u201cNobody comes into\nwork to do a bad job. It\u2019s\nnot that, but rather people\nbeing frustrated. We\u2019re\nin a situation with 20+\ndepartments doing things\n20+ ways, and in some\nways have made things\ndifficult for ourselves,\nwhich is why we are\ntrying to optimise processes and expand systems to\ninclude things like student\nbookings. A lot of this\nwork is about surfacing\nthose differences, and\nseeing if we can establish\na process and direction for\nimprovement, to make the\nwhole thing much simpler\n\u2013 but it takes a lot of time\nand resource to do so.\u201d\nChris Banks, Assistant Provost (Space) // Thomas Angus\n\u201cImperial\ncurrently only\nmanages space\nutilisation of\naround 22%\u201d\nin order to allow for a\ngrowing student cohort.\nThe overall student\nnumbers at Imperial have\nincreased by almost 20%\nin the last five years,\nbetween the 2013-14 and\n2018-19 academic years.\nCurrently, teaching\nspace in the College\nappears heavily un-derutilised as a whole.\nThe national Research\nEngland benchmark is\ncurrently for space to be\nutilised at 35%, calculated on the hours a room\nis available, time spent\nusing the room and how\nfull the room is during\nuse \u2013 but Imperial only\nmanages around 22%\nbased on recent data.\nThe concept is that\n\n"
