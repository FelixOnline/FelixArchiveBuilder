As the\nvehicles in this road have\na tendency to appear at\nfairly - regular intervals\nrather than sporadically\na pedestrian cannot normally complete a crossing without halting in the\nmiddle of the road\u2014this\ndoes, of course, assume\nthat the east and west\nflows are of the same order (as they appear to be)\nand this seems to suggest\nthat we should have a central refuge to protect\npedestrians ait this otherwise very dangerous position on the road.\"\nalone agreement on common interests and beliefs . . . but something\ndoes.\nHaving got your com-posited motion, and the\nsecretarial staff having run\noff 1,000 copies of it\n(that's how many people\nthere are at conference)\nyou can sit down, or rather stand up, and discuss it.\nThe \"discussions\" are\nrather like Union General Meetings where everybody is a( generally either\nCommunist or other extreme left-wing faction)\nl st class bureaucrat and\nsuper - constitutionalist\n(they know their constitution and standing orders\nupside down, in other\nwords).

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX - November 21, 1972,\nFELIX FINANCIALLY\nGoing Cheap...\nTravel, in the younger sort, is a part of education:\nin the elder, part of experience. Francis Bacon it\nwas who penned that piece of wisdom. And even\nallowing for the fact that the world is a much smaller\nplace these days, his sentiments are as true now\nas they were when he wrote them at the beginning\nof the 17th century.\nBut, call it education or experience, travel is big\nbusiness these days\u2014and getting bigger. It's been\ncalculated that on any day, about three-quarters of\na million people\u2014that's equivalent to the population\nof, say, Lisbon \u2014 are travelling by air from one\ncountry to another. And that is big business.\nThe cheap package tour is a standard item today.\nThe air charter business is growing and the fares\nto exotic places are getting progressively lower.\nThe whole structure of expensive and rigidly controlled air fares is beginning to tumble, which means\nthat even the most ambitious trips to faraway places\nare coming within the reach of everyone.\nAny time now, the colour supplements, newspapers and television will be smothered in travel\nadvertising. Felix Financially is going to jump the\ngun a bit and have a look at what is happening in\nthe travel business.\nFor the expert view of the travel scene and what\nit holds for those who want to get away from it all,\nwe went to talk to Mr. Brian Powell, managing\ndirector of Sundowners Travel, a large organisation\nspecialising in overland transportation and air chartering operations.\nHere's our report:\nFELIX FINANCIALLY :\nWe've all heard a lot in\nrecent months about the\ncoming of really cheap\nair travel, and that's of\nenormous interest to stu-dents. But is it all talk\n\u2014or is it really going to\nhappen?\nPOWELL: Yes, it's really\ngoing to happen. At last\n\u2014 at long last \u2014 the\nstranglehold with which\nthe major airlines have\nheld air fares at an artificially high level has\nbeen broken, and cheap\nair travel is here. For\nexample, one of our\nsmall airlines took delivery last week of a brand-new 360-seat jet\nand they are going to use\nit for transatlantic flights\nwhich will cost you only\nthirty pounds for a single\nticket to New York. And\nafter April 1 next year,\nwhen many of the restrictions on charter\nflights will be lifted,\nthere will be a lot of\nothers offering similar\nlow-fare flying. It's a major breakthrough in\nthe travel business and I think it is very good\nnews for people like students who don't really\ncare whether they see a movie while they're flying the Atlantic, so long\nas they get to the other\nside.\nFF: Good news indeed.\nHow has it happened?\nPOWELL: In the past, the\nInternational Air Transport Association\u2014I ATA\n\u2014has fixed all scheduled air fares, as well as\nlaying down minimum\nand maximum standards\nof passenger comfort. It\nmeant all airlines were\nexactly the same. Competition was eliminated\nand fares remained artificially high only because most scheduled\nflights fly little more than\nSPECIALISTS IN TRAVEL TO AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND\nOVERLAND\n44, 72 or 80 days by coach to Katmandu.\nOnward air connections via Bank ok and Singapore,\nor budget returns to U.K. Departures every February, March, May, August,\nSeptember and October.\nALL JET\nLONDON/SINGAPORE/AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND Including 1 night's accommodation in Singapore.\nYou may stay longer at your own expense if you wish.\nfrom \u00a3110\nFrom \u00a3165\nJET/SHIP\nLONDON/SINGAPORE (JET)\nSHIP TO FREWANTLE, MELB, SYD., N.Z.

At the same\ntime, the airlines did\ntheir best to ignore the\nreal growth area in air\ntravel\u2014the air charter\nand package tour bus i ness.\nBut in the end, they\ngot the message. Faced\nwith falling payloads and\nthe need to buy bigger\nand better aircraft just\nbecause everyone else\nwas doing so, the airlines realised that the\nonly way to operate economically was to make\ncertain they flew with\nevery seat sold. And\nthat means the charter\nand package tour end of\nthe business. They\ncouldn't beat the little\nsense, they've come full\ncircle because it was\nthey themselves who created the air charter\nbusiness. When they\nbought new aircraft, they\nsold the old ones\ncheaply to the smaller\nfellows. Where the small\nfry once flew Dakotas,\nthey now fly 707's. They\noffer luxury flying at\ncheap prices \u2014 and the\npublic will always go for\ncheap fares.\nFF: So cheap flying has\nbecome respectable. But\naren't there still restrictions about how and\nwhen you can take cheap\ncharter flights?\nPOWELL: Yes, there are.\nCash\u2014\nand carrying it\nIf you're going to travel, what's the best\nway to take your spending money? The foreign\nmanager of an international agency offered\nthis advice.\nTake traveller's cheques that offer replacement against loss. American Express and\nCook's do this. Bank traveller's cheques do\nnot.\nIf you don't want to pay the commission on\ncheques and prefer cash, you can take up to\nfifty pounds in foreign currency with you, so\nchange your money into Swiss francs or German Deutschmarks before you leave. They're\nabout the safest currencies.\nAnd one other thing: It's welt worth taking\nout medical insurance before you go. This is\nvery cheap. To cover a six-week tour against\naccident, sickness, hospital costs, repatriation and luggage insurance will cost about \u00a34.\nConsidering the kind of trouble you might get\ninto if you fall sick in some remote place, this\ntype of insurance is a bargain.\nfellows, so, inevitably,\nthey have joined them.\nSome major airlines\nthreatened to defy IATA,\nand from there, the\nwhole edifice began to\ncrumble.\nFF: Why did they wait so\nlong?\nPOWELL: As long as\nthe scheduled operators\ncould keep the cheap-flight charter business\nrestricted, they were\nhappy to keep their\nmonopoly. Chartering\ncheap flights was hedged\nabout with rules about\naffinity groups and the\nneed to join some kind\nof club before you were\nentitled to fly. But what\nfinally broke the monopoly was a two-fold de-velo p ment. First, the\nenormous and lucrative\nholiday package tour:\nand the coming of the\nJumbo jet. Somehow,\nthey had to fill their expanded seat capacity,\nand there was only one\nway to do it \u2014 sell them\ncheaply with block\nbookings, guaranteed\nweeks before the plane\ntakes off.\nNow, they're all into\nit \u2014 BOAC, Lufthansa\nand all the rest. In a But that's being chang-ed, too. From April 1,\n1973, the whole business\nof having to join a club\n\u2014 even something as\nphoney as The Friends\nof Foster's Beer \u2014 will\nbe discarded. You'll be\nable to go wherever you\nwant providing you can\npay the fare. You'll have\nto book three months in\nadvance, of course, but\nI think even that will be\nreduced eventually.\nFF: So the world's our\noyster now, is it?\nPOWELL: I think so.\nNow that we've broken\nthe old cartel, airlines\nare going to be falling\nover themselves to cash\nin on the tremendous\nurge to see the world.\nMind you, they're still\nmoving much too slowly.\nPersonally, I'm appalled\nat the lack of imagination displayed. Far too\nmany people in the\nbusiness still think anywhere east of Athens is\nover the edge of the\nworld. But sooner or\nlater, they'll wake up to\nthe fact that people now\nwant to go further and\nfurther abroad, to places\nlike Rangoon, Bangkok,\nLatin America and\nAfrica. But as yet, we're\nonly on the brink of a travel revolution.\nFF: But won't all this\ncheap travel attract the\nsharks \u2014 the kind of\noperator who might fly\nyou somewhere and then\nleave you stranded?\nThere seems to be a lot\nof them about.\nPOWELL: I agree that\ngovernments and the travel business have been\ndeplorably slow to eliminate that kind of bucket-shop operator. But from\nJanuary 1 next year, all\nthese kind of people will\nhave to be licensed and\nwill have to prove they\ncan do what they say\nthey'll do. And that can\nonly be good for every-one.\nWe've all been waiting a long time for these\nthings to happen. There\nhas been a lot of resistance to the concept of\ncheap air travel, a lot of\nargument and an incredible degree of short-sightedness. But it is\nhappening now.\nYou can go to New\nYork for thirty pounds if\nyou're willing to take\nthe chance of a seat and\ntake your own sand-wi che s. If you want to\nbook ahead, you can do\nit for \u00a358 return. Compare that to the scheduled fare of \u00a3168. And\nthat's only the begin-ning. Already a fare of\n\u00a3125 to Australia is being mooted and I think\nsimilar cheap flying is\nsoon going to be available to anywhere in the\nworld.\nFF: So that's air travel.\nWhat about other ways\nof seeing the world?\nPOWELL: Going overland is cheaper still, of\ncourse. It's possible to\nget from London to Australia by going overland\nto Katmandu and flying\nfrom there via Bangkok\nand Singapore to Sydney \u2014 all for \u00a3289. A42 day tour from London to Katmandu and\nback can be done for as\nlittle as \u00a3105, and that\nincludes camping on the\nway.\nIn fact. I think the\nkind of overland tours\nwe operate have helped\npioneer all forms of\ncheap travel. And can go\nwhere the airlines can't go. For example, we can\noffer a six-week tour of\nEastern Europe, including the whole of Russia,\nfor \u00a3110, with combined\ncamping and hotel accommodation en route.\nAnd now we've opened\nup the northern parts of\nAfrica, too.\nThe thing is that seeing the world no longer\nhas to be the prerogative\nof the wealthy. It's within the reach of everyone\nyou.\nand that means\n\n"

That enigma of rural splendour is\nprobably Wandsworth or Southwark or Burton-on Trent.... One of the biggest\ncon. tricks pushed\nthrough in recent years\nhas been the advent and\nrapid expansion of the\nUK draught lager indus-try. Lagers with Scandinavian names like Carlsberg and Skol are now\nhousehold names and\nconsumers, believing\nthat they are paying good\nmoney for the privilege\nof drinking strong, Continental brews, are the\nvictims of a gigantic rip-off. What they are drinking is very English and\nis probably weaker than\nthe keg bitter stood next\nto it \u2014 and that hasn't got much to say for it-self, either.\nIn the UK we have six\nmajor brewing groups\nwho, in the past few\nyears have acquired\nmany smaller breweries\nand now control the vast\nmajority of outlets.\nThese, besides each\nmarketing their own\nprestige keg bitter, also\nretail their own brand of\nEnglish lager:\u2014\nAllied Breweries( Double Diamond) brew\nSKOL in the UK (Skol\nInternational is part of\nthe Allied group).\nBass Charrington ('E') brew Carling Black\nLabel.\nCourage (Tavern) and\nScottish Newcastle (Tar-tan) each retail Harp\nlager, which is brewed\nby Guinness.\nCarlsberg is a famous\nDanish brewery, but the\ndraught lager marketed\nin the UK is brewed by\nWatney Mann (Red).\nThe only true Continental draught lager\nmarketed in the UK is\nStella Artois. Stella is\nhere on a reciprocal\nagreement between its\nBelgian brewers and\nWhitbread (Tankard)\nwho sell Trophy bitter in\nStella houses in Belgium.\nEven so, Stella is uncommon over here compared with Heineken,\nbrewed under licence by\nWhitbread themselves.\nSome smaller breweries also have their own\nbrand-name lagers.\nBut the story doesn't end there. It's all very\nwell having consumers\nwho think that a weak\nEnglish beer is a strong\nContinental lager. That\nhelps to sell it, yes, but\nthe breweries go further\nthan that. They make a profit which in many\ncases is approaching\n200 per cent on cost\nprice. Not a bad return!\nThe college can buy\na keg of lager at a price\nequivalent to about 11 pa pint. (Fractionally\ngreater than, say, Tartan\nat 10.5 pence). This\nprice is obviously above\ncost, since the brewery\nmust take a profit from\nit. Cost price could be\nabout 9 pence, say, and\nwith many pubs in Central London charging 25\npence or more for a pint,\nthe profit margin is up\ninto the 200 per cent\nmark. On top of this,\nthe pubs where the price\nis highest are not the\ntenant houses but managed joints where the\nbrewery reaps all the\nprofit.\nEven the bitter prices,\nnow approaching 20\npence a pint are pulling\nin profits well over 100\nper cent of cost. And if\nMooney, not renowned\nfor efficient manage-ment, can make a profit\nout of Tartan at 13\npence a pint, then absolutely everyone can. Just\nthink, before decimalisation, if you would\nhave meekly handed\nover four bob for a pint\nof bitter and 5/6d for a pint of lager.\nAll of this points the\nfinger at the big breweries who are all pulling\nin record profits (and\nScottish-Newcastle gave\nthe biggest donation of\nall industry to the Tory\nfunds for the last ele c tion).\nSo next time you're\nhanding over 26 pence\nfor a pint of lager remember that Boots do a very nice, easy to make,\nhome-brew kit making\nlager twice the strength\nfor 4 pence a pint.\nAnd bottled lager?\nYou've noticed the light\nale bottles are the same\nshape as the lagers \u2014\nright! With the exception\nof Carlsberg Specials\nand odd others (the\nbottles give them away),\nthey're from Britain's Norseland, too.\nMartin Doughty\nCONCERT REVIEW\nLast Saturday about 1200 people were packed\ninto the Great Hall when String Driven things,\na[4 piece, drummer-less, Scottish band, took the\nstage at 9.15. In the opening number, \"Let Me\nDown\", it was evident that the only English mem-ber, Graeme Smith, was no slouch on the electric\nviolin. This was followed by \"Then I Met the Lady\",\nwhich was quite good despite the rhythm guitarist,\nChris Adams, breaking one of his strings. Filling in\nwith a shortened version of Dylan's \"Just Like a Woman\", they continued and despite the rather off-putting cries of Genesis from the crowd they finished well with \"Jack Diamond\", Chris and Pauline\nAdams harmon ising nicely, with a lengthy piece on\nthe violin in the middle. Colin Wilson played bass.\nLater, Genesis played very well, though unfortunately the quieter pieces of their music was spoilt\nby a persistent buzz from the P.A.A cheer went up\nas lead vocalist and flautist, Peter Gabriel, announced \"Watcher of the Skies\", and a smile of satisfaction crept across his face. Otherwise he looked\nvery sinister with his partly shaved head and dressed all in black.\nThis was followed by the short story of Uncle\nHenry, leading into \"The Musical Box\", then \"Get\n'Em Out by Friday\" and \"Supper's Ready\",\nwhich was, perhaps, a little patchy, but was well\nreceived. In it Michael Rutherford played bass-pedals, 6 and 12-string guitars, and a rather powerful bass. Tony Banks played well, as always, on\nkeyboards and 12-string, Steve Hackett was on\nelectric and 12-string guitars, and Phil Collins,\nwearing only a pair of shorts, worked through an\nunusual number of cymbals, and other percussion\ninstruments.\nLast was \"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\",\ncontaining a well-timed flare and more prancing\naround by Peter Gabriel. The encore was a mere\nformality, as they returned to conclude with\n\"Knife\". G. J.K.

Try ar.j, l th.'nk of the best way of getting all these facilities to cluster about each other\nso that it would be possible for an audience to circle around the building in\nany direction. Now the result of your fantasies might come pretty close to\nresembling the facilities offered \"Under the Arches\": known by some as\nGlobal Village, by others simply as the Village, and by a few simply as \"it\".\nNext, think up a show that uses up every nook and cranny of the building,\na show created out of the synthesis of all the arts in some sort of attempt to\nhomo genis e the abstraction in their separate fields. So what would be the\nresult? Solid state art? A perceptive totality? Why bother to describe what\n\"might be\"? Here is a rapid breakdown of the ingredients and some of the things we\nmight be doing: as well as the straight gallery shows by one group of artists,\nanother might be given enough bread to create work in the building; with\nlights, with slides, with any material they wish, also with the sense that\npeople are watching their work as it grows, that their brothers are bes'rie*\nthem requiring props, effects, fanfares. Poems might be read among paint-in gs, dancers might discover they are musicians \u2014 and you? How will you\nreact when you walk into a building where a catalogue is simply a field of\nwords? The leap from the recognisable into the indescribable is bound to\nfrighten some, but say one imposes this limit on the artists; that within the\nwide arena of the show they may only approach people in the terms of their\nown art. Dancers shake hands but may not speak, musicians ring bells but\nmay not move, poets make articulate the schemes of language whilst venturing no remarks, then fear of knowing and desire to tell may reach equal pitch.\nWe have plans for operas which may be performed immediately by 200\npeople, free poems, sculpture for children, acrobatic ballets with full decor\nthat can be put together in an afternoon, all this linked together by the circus,\nwhich is back in Charing Cross \u2014 where the circus began.\nAdd to these ingredients a Friday night HOP with groups of all descriptions and also what we hope will be a regular jazz venue, and you get the sort\nof nameless everything UNDER THE ARCHES could be for you\u2014and for us.\nHere's our address UNDER THE ARCHES, off Villiers Street, Charing\nCross WC2.

    "content": "21st November, 1972\nNEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nFREE! ISSUE No. 319\nDon't forget\nUNION MEETING\nThursday\n13.00 hours\nGreat\nCOUNCIL\nREFORM\nAt a stroke!\nImperial College Union Council is in existence to\nmanage the affairs of the Union but this fact is obscured quite successfully by the extensive discussion of\ntrivia. This makes the meetings boring by definition\nand the 169th which occurred last Monday was no\nexception.\nBefore the reasons for\nthe failure of Council are\ndiscussed, some examples\nof what happens are taken\nfrom the most recent dis-aster. The minutes of the\nprevious meeting were ap-proved. It would have\nbeen difficult to find anything wrong with them\nanyway since they had only been available a few\nhours before the meeting!\nThey run to eight pages,\nand include such items as\n\"Somewhere around here\nMCB said T don't want to\nbe nasty and bureaucratic\nabout this ! ! \"\nAlthough these extracts\nmight give the impression\nthat nothing of importance\nwas discussed, this would\nbe a wrong conclusion.\nQuite relevant items are\nintroduced into the agenda\nsuch as NUS Elections,\nplans for the new hall, external affairs in the form\nof the Murray Report, a new traffic flow scheme for\nExhibition Road, etc. How\never, these are invariably\npre-packed and require a large amount of expert\nknowledge to comment on\nthem. In all matters of im-port ance, decisions have\nbeen made before the\nmeeting which makes it\ndifficult for Council to\naffect the course of events.\nPerhaps the most important issues, that is those\nconnected with Union fin-ance, are the most difficult\nto control. It is inevitable\nthat ACQ RCC & SCC\nexpenditure will have been\ndetermined before the\nmeeting with Council becoming no more than a rubber stamp.\nWhy should this be so\nAfter all, everyone at the\nmeeting comes with good\nintentions. The Executive\nof the Union, i.e. the Top\nSix in the organisation,\nprepare the agenda for\nthe meetings and determine how they will be\ndiscussed. This is possible\nmainly because there is\nno discussion on the important items!\nAt this stage it is useful to invoke Parkinson's Law which goes into some\ndetail as to the effectiveness of governing bodies\nand councils. Parkinson\ndraws attention to the\nstrict relation between the\nnumber of Cabinet Ministers and the power the\ntitle \"Cabinet\" implies,\nThe magic number is 20;\nbelow this, the cabinet\nhas an effective say in the\nrunning of the Government\nwith a consequent limitation of Executive power.\nAbove this, and a smaller group (approximately\n5 or 6) forms which decides policy and presents\nit to the castrated remnants of the Cabinet. The\nworst case he cites is that\nof the USSR which has a cabinet of 38.\nApplying this to ICU\nwe find it no exception\nto the theory outlined.\nCouncil has a membership in excess of 40, even\nworse than the USSR!\nThe Executive group has\ntaken over all major bus i ness, and the idea of a Council which manages\nthe Union has faded into\nthe past.\nA cursory glance at the\nlist of Council members\nshows how it could be reduced below the 20 mark\nThe concept of a Floor\nRep is misconceived at\nthe best of times. Theoretically they represent the\n\"ordinary Union mem-ber,\" but more often represent themselves. This\nA Felix\ncorrespondent argues\nthe need to change\nCouncil\nPresidential Elections again this week\nThe Presidential elections have come upon us yet again! This time, however, there\nare five possible candidates of all political leanings. The Manifestos which are printed\non page 7 go into the candidates' opinions and Felix will not comment on their merits\n(or demerits). However, a slight clarification of the situation is necessary.\nThere are 3 Soc.Soc. candidates but the \"official\" one is John Lane. Adrian Smith\nis standing again and must be congratulated for persistence. The other two are of no\nfixed political bias and might succeed in identifying with a large percentage of students.\nRemember the Hustings are on Thursday at 13.00 in the Great Hall and are well worth\nattending.\nElections are on the Friday and Monday in the JCR-Union Building and South-Side.\nNow turn to page 7 v,. FRIDAY NEXT FOR 4 DAYS ONLY.. is inevitable and it should\nbe accepted that no-one\nshould be on council without a specific responsibility. The Department reps\ncould quite easily be taken off Council since the\nAcademic Affairs Officer\ncan be responsible for\nthem.\nThe CCU Academic\nAffairs officers can be disregarded as an office altogether since they have\nbeen made redundant by\nthe Union officer.\nThe Old Students' reps\nhave no right to comment\non the affairs of the Union and should not be on\nCouncil.\nIf these people are excluded from Council, the\nNUS take over\nMargate\nConference is the supreme governing body of the\nNational Union of Students. It meets twice a year,\nonce in November at Margate and again in April some\nWhere else (last year Birmingham, this year Exeter).\nConference consists of delegates and observers from all\nthe 'Constituent Organisations\" (C.O's) of the NUS,\nthe number of delegates being dependent on the number of students in the college or institution in question.\nThese are (theoretically) elected by and from the students of the college at a UGM\u2014this is the case at IC,\nbut is not everywhere.\nNext weekend sees the NUS Annual Conference\nat Margate . . . 32 hours of debating between the\nrepresentatives of most colleges and educational mst it ut ions in the Country crammed into one week ew fl The subjects talked about range from the sublime to\nthe ridiculous, the standard of debating from highly\nresponsible to utterly puerile.\nWhat will the conference achieve? What does the\nNUS do for you, the students of Imperial College?\nWhy have a national union at all? Does the NUS ameliorate or detract from the image of students general-ly? How representative is the NUS . . . and how representative of the NUS is conference?\nThese are some of the questions that are always\nasked about the NUS, and that we will be discussing\nover the next couple of weeks in \"Felix.\" The conference will be covered in detail by Oliver Dowson audi\nRoss McBeath for \"Felix\"' in the December 5th issue\n. . . but a preliminary report will be rushed to the printers in time for next week's issue.\nEach CO is permitted to\nsubmit a certain number\nof motions to conference\n(IC are entitled to 6), and\nwhen the list of motions,\ncalled the 'Agenda\" is\npublished, C.O.'s are entitled to submit amendments to these motions.\nThere are usually of the\norder of 100 motions . .\nobviously far too many to\ndiscuss in the limited\ntime available. (Motions,\nby the way, can be about\njust about anything\u2014Education, Welfare International Affairs, etc., etc.)\nIn order to cut down the\nnumber drops to about 20,\nThis is highly desirable\nsince it will curtail the\npowers of the Executive\nconsiderably.\nnumber of motions to a discuss able level {usually\n4!) a system of \"Priori-tis ation\" is used. Each CO\nhas fifteen priority points,\nwhich it can put in any\ncombination on the motions of its choice. For\nexample, it could give 1\npoint of each of 15 mo-t ions, or 3 points to 3 motions and 6 to another, or\nput all 15 points on one\nmotion\u2014it doesn't matter\nas long as all the priority\npoints are used up. When\nall the C.O.'s have submitted their priorities, all\nthe points for each motion\nare added up, and the top\nfour are put on the order\npaper for discussion. This\ntime they are Grants,\nHousing, Representation\nand Autonomy, The rest\nare put on a reserve list.\nBy the time all the\namendments are added to\nthe original motion, these\nmotions get to be pretty\nbig and unwieldy things.\nIt's not unusual to start\nwith a small motion with\nthirty or forty amendments to it, and it's not\nunreasonable to suppose\nthat some of these amendments are pretty much the\nsame as each other, and\nthat some of them are non-contentious . . . i.e. the CO\nthat put up the original\nmotion agrees with them.\nSo, at conference, wonderful things called 'Com-positing Sessions\" are\nheld with the intention\nand eventual result of\nboiling down motions so\nthat you end up with a main motion With between\n2 and 20 amendments tab-(Continued on page 2)\nEnts no\n\u00a31000 +\nin black\nEnts made another profit on Saturday night \u2014\n\u00a3170 \u2014 bringing their\nterm's profit to over\n\u00a31,000.

Last week he\nwas ushered into the sanctum of Carl Seaford,\nDomestic Bursar, to hear\nthat a letter had been sent\n\"on behalf of the Union\"\ncomplaining about him.\nAccording to Ron, the\nletter alleges just about\neverything against him\nexcept for murder and\nrape. Carl wouldn't tell\nhim who wrote the letter,\nthough, nor would he tell\nNUPE (Nat. Union of\nPublic Employees\u2014Ron's union) officials who went\nto see Seaford later in the\nweek. The letter not only\naccused Ron of laziness,\nslovenliness and insolence,\nbut even of \"dirtiness\" . . .\nand Ron considers it not\nonly insulting but libel-lou s. No-one in the Union\noffice will admit to being\nthe author of this epistle,\nbut there are strong\nrumours . . . Meanwhile,\nRon is going to be moved\n\u2014 and he's even sorer\nabout that.\nWhile hordes of fans\ninvaded the Union office\non Thursday, that mirror\nof hospitality and good-will, Martin C. Black\n(B. Sc, ARCS, Esq., Hon.\nSecretary ICU) was away\nbusying himself with entertaining 25 Russian stu-dents. Foisted upon him\nby the NUS as an early\nChristmas present, the\n\"students\" turned out to\nbe the East European\nversion of American tour-is ts, resplendent with their\ncameras, tape recorders\nand balalaikas slung\nround their necks. \"Spon-ta neo us ly\" exchanging\ngifts (a100 rou ble note\nfor a Mines tie-pin), Mr.\nAlexei Zagreb Popovich,\n73, an average \"student\"\nof the group, told a \"Fel-i city\" scout that he loved\nall of our filthy capitalist\nmetropolis oli ski\" especially the Crown Jewels and\nthe Cromwell Road\nbranch of the Natzional\nVestminster Bank. The\n\"students\" also thrilled to\na Linstead Hall supper,\nespecially the green beans\nwhich most of them left,\nthinking them to be cab-b age. The student party\nhas invited MCB to a return visit to their \"col-leg e\" in Siberia for a few\nyears.\nA prominent notice on\none of the doors of the\nJCR onto the walkway\nreads \"This door must be\nkept open at all times that\npeople are in the room\".\nIt is not unusual to find\nthe door still locked at\neleven o' cloe k in the morn-ing.\nAre you a table football\naddict? City of London\nPolytechnic are organising\nan inter-collegiate table\nfootball competition,\nwhich ICU are entering.\nIf you don't frequent the\nUnion Bar, odds are\nyou've never heard of the\naforesaid competition \u2014\nand unless you go there\nsoon, you probably never\nwill. ICU organiser is\nBrendan Clements, and all\npreliminary rounds must\nbe held in the Union Bar\n. . . which sounds suspiciously like the idea of the\nmember of the ICU exec.\nWho has organised it\n(well, where else would\nyou look for him of an\nevening?).\nIt's about time that Weeks\nHall got their digits extra c ted. It's now the only hall\nnot to have elected its\nHall Committee for the\n-year, which the Residence\nRegulations laid down by\nthe College require it to do\nat the start of each session.\ncef e The Editor of Felix has\nbeen getting famous lately\nin the pages of our negligible rival, the RCS\n\"Broadsheet\". Perhaps the\nimpressive thing about last\nweek's issue was that none\nof the references to the\naforesaid gentleman were\nderogatory. If you too\nwere wondering where\nMr. Dowson was for [he\nfirst half of last week, informed sources (the man\nhimself) tell us that he\nwas recovering from illness contracted from a SRC meeting and Murray\npress conference in close\nsuccession. And if you\nwere wondering why there\nare only 2,000 copies of\nFelix, every week for 4,000\nstudents, well, it's 'cos\nthey cost money. Come to\nthink of it, the extra \u00a3300\na year to print 4,000 copies per issue might be repaid by higher advertising rates (and make Felix\nthe 3rd instead of 6th or\n7th biggest student paper\nin the country). At the\nmoment the 2,000 copies\nthat are put on the news\nstands at 9 a.m. every\nTuesday morning are\ncompletely gone by 2 that\nafternoon. Bears thinking\nabout. . . .\nCEFE, the news-sheet\nproduced by various members of Soc Soc, has been\nin existence for a number\nof years now. The gap in\ncommunications that was\nthe original reason for the\nstarting of .CEFE still\nexists today and so it still\nperforms an important\nrole. This is best summarised in a brief explanation\nof the main aims of\nCEFE. The issues written\nabout are both local and\nvery general. The local\nissues such as student\nproblems and actions in\nI.C., the problems faced\nby the workers in I.C. and\nthe housing situation in\nNotting Hill are too small\nto merit publication outside the college but nevertheless are very important\nwithin it. In the wider as-pec t, issues that affect us\nall in one way or another are dealt with in\nthe news-sheet. Since a. lumber of individuals\nwrite the articles in CEFE\ndifferent views are sometimes put forward on\nspecific issues but this in\nno way detracts from the\nimportance of CEFE.\nThe crucial point is that\nthe importance of the\nissues is clearly shown.\nCEFE also aims to present views which often do\nnot get wide publicity in\nthe mass media and to\npromote discussion on\nthese points. When such\nviews are presented then\ndiscussion can be made by\npeople balancing two sides\nof an argument. The\ngenerally published line\ndoes not always have to\nbe accepted.\nIn the \"Opinion\" column of Felix these aims\ncan still actively be pur-sued. Important topics\ncan be raised and general\ndiscussion on them pro-mote d. Because of the\nwider circulation of\n'Felix' it may be that this\nwill be accomplished more\neffectively. If it is then\nFelix will begin to fulfil\nthe only purpose with\nwhich it can justify its existence \u2014 that is as a means of communication\nfor the students of l.C. Communication does not\nonly involve letting students know what is going\non (Wotson) but also involves presenting views\non important issues in\norder to promote discussion on these.\nUp till now, we have\nbeen treated to the same\nlack of priorities, which\nhas very effectively stifled\nall real communication,\nfrom both the editor of\nFelix and the secretary of\nI.C.U. The editor of Felix\nhas even at times overstepped the limits of\n\"wrong priorities\" to attempt directly to stop\ndiscussion. Do you remember the call to \"Ab-stain\" at the last elections? It is possible that\nthis was a mistake and\nthe impression of a call\nto abstain was not intended (this was indeed\nthe case\u2014Ed.) but 1his is\nnot the view taken by a lot of people. There have\nbeen too many mistakes\nthat have stopped discussion and too often the\npriorities chosen by the\neditor of Felix have also\nhad this same effect. The\nextension of room in Felix for \"Opinion\", which\ncan -only help further com-muni cation, is a start. The\nlong term view of this\nmust be to extend the\nscope of this beyond the\nfew alternative news-sheets now existing in\ncollege to make Felix an\nopen and lively means of\ncommunication.*\nThe secretary of ICU\nhas had his main effect\non communication at the\nUnion General Meetings.\nMotions dealing with important issues of concern\nto us all have been pushed\nto the end of the agenda\nand then talked out of the\nmeeting by long executive\nreports. The immediate\nanswer to this is that\nmembers of the union\nshould make strong efforts\nto ensure the order of the\nTHE EDITOR REGRETS that, because of his\nillness in the early part of last week, this issue of\n\"Felix\" is not exactly as scheduled. The UNION DIRECTORY, although now ready to print, has\nhad to be held over because it could not be pre\npared in time for the printers to print the extra\npages required. Felix's promised new look, too,\nis incomplete, although certain parts of it have\nbeen included in this issue. Because of various\nfactors, the only broadsheet represented in our\nnew \"Opinion\" page this week is CEF E: \"Some-thing\" follows next week and after that, hopefully,\nthe three constituent college broadsheets and\n\" CEF E\" and \"Something\" will alternate, the first\nthree one week, the other two the next.\nagenda is agreed at the\nbeginning of the meeting.\nThis would make sure that\nall the important issues\nreceive full time for dis-cus sion. During the election\ncampaign last spring we\nheard many line words\nabout the communications\namongst students more\nefficient. The weekly Felix, with a sabbatical\neditor, was to play a prominent part in this. So far\nwe have found both\nMCB and the editor of\nFelix doing exactly the\nopposite. In fact, both\nthese people are actively\ntrying to stifle com muni cation.\nThe opinion page in\nFelix may be the beginning of a long haul towards the situation in\nwhich a weekly Felix\ncould promote and add\nto the discussion at union\nmeetings. In such a situation Felix would act as a complement to union\nmeetings and would thus\nimprove communications.\nIPRARIES HAVE CHANGED\nSINCE 1941- VISIT THE\nLDANE LIBRA\nCOLLEGE BLOCK, LEVEL 2\nbooks - newspapers - magazines - records\n\n"

Cup when\nthey met King's College in the preliminary round (why\nthe holders have to play a preliminary match is quite\nbeyond me). This was the third year running that these\nteams had met each other in their first cup matches,\nand for the third time I.C. proved to be the better side.\nKing's had made a good start to the season and must\nhave been one of the favourites, along with Imperial,\nto take the cup.\nAfter winning the toss, I.C. played into a very strong\nwind for the first half. The early stages of the game\nwere at a very slow pace and this seemed to suit King's, who had most of the early play. The I.C. defence was\na bit shaky at first, and but for a fine save by Gerwyn\nEdwards, King's would have taken an early lead. However I.C. weathered this storm successfully and once\nthe defence settled down the game became more even.\nOn the left wing Pete Lonnen was oj early too fast for\nhis full back and I.C. created a few chances this way\nbut their only reward was several corner kicks. Towards\nthe end of the half Billy Milne should have put I.C. one\nup when put through by Ronkill, however the score\nwas still 0-0 at the end of an even first half. Mention\nshould be made of Ian Pos, who did well to win most\nof the ball in the air for I.C.'s defence despite the\nswirling wind.\nWith the wind behind them in the second half, I.C.'s midfield began to give better service to their forwards\nwho came close to scoring several times. Byron Smith\nwas the first to try his luck, with a drive from 30 yards\nwhich the keeper didn't even see until it came back\noff the bar\u2014just too far away for Johnny Kelly to\nreach. A free kick on the edge of King's penalty area\ngave Maurice Hastings a chance to show his shooting\npower, and produced a fine save from the King's keeper.\nFifteen minutes into the half Billy Milne atoned for\nhis earlier miss when he put a low shot into the corner\nof the net from twelve yards. This goal gave Imperial\nthe confidence to go with their determination and for\nthe first time in the match one side was now in control.\nFrom a well flight ed corner, lam Postlethwaite was unlucky not to score when he soared above everyone else\nonly to see his header bounce off the bar into the\nkeeper's hands.\nThe King's keeper seemed to be getting a little\nanxious about his defence's inability to keep the ball\naway from I.C.'s forwards, and this may have been in\npart the cause of his poor clearance from which Steve\nBates beat the King's defender and drove the ball\nsmartly into the far corner of the net from 25 yards\u2014\na really great goal. Within a few minutes of this, Maurice Hastings left the field with a thigh injury and was\nreplaced by Steve Wells. Almost immediately King's pulled one back, although this might just have been\ncoincidence. The King's goal was a well taken affair\nbut all the same, some blame must attach to the I.C. defence for hesitation. King's newly found vigour did\nnot last long for their keeper failed to hold a shot from\nPete Lonnen and Billy Milne made it 3-1 from close\nrange.\nThis was by far the best performance seen from Imperial this year and if they can only keep it up there\nmust be a good chance of completing a hat-trick of cup\nwins at Motspur Park later this season.\nAlso on Saturday the seconds were surprisingly\nbeaten 4-3 in the reserve cup by U.C.3 rds( at least that's who they claimed to be!). The 5th s, playing a man\nshort against LSE 3rds went down 4\u20142. The 7th s had\nanother close game with U.C.7 th s and for the second\ntime they won, this time by 1-0\nWednesday the 15th saw I.C. travelling to Collier's Wood to play Chelsea. Thisfixturelast year had been\na little one sided (8\u20141 to I.C.) but no one expected any\neasy game this time, and no one got one. Chelsea got off\nto a great start when, after 15 minutes some very weak\ntackling allowed their centre-forward to walk through\nthe centre of the Imperial defence. This setback stirred\nI.C. into action but fate was not yet on their side, and\nneither was the Chelsea keeper who made good saves\nfrom Mick McConvey and Byron Smith (must mention\nhim to get picked for Wednesday). I.C. had most of the\nplay for the rest of the half although the Chelsea\nkeeper's big (wind-assisted) kick did cause trouble from\ntime to time.\nIn the second half I.C struck quickly. Pete Lonnen\nmade a good run down the left and his hard hit cross\nwell left by Billy Milne allowing Mick McConvey to\nhammer home the equalise r. Almost immediately Steve\nBates ran onto a through ball (from whom, I forget)\nand in the ensuing collision he laid out the right back\nand the goalkeeper. Oh yes!\u2014he scored as well. Now\n2\n\u2014\n1 up I.C. relaxed a little and Chelsea began to come\nback into the game. Just as it seemed that they might\ngain the upper foot, Ron Kill did his, rarely-seen, impression of Terry Cooper for 50 yards down the left\nwing before drawing the keeper and slipping the ball\ninside to Billy Milne who scored with little trouble\nfrom 3 yards. Now 3\n\u2014\n1 up I.C. relaxed even further\nand Chelsea pulled one back when slack marking of\nthe right let their No. 10 in to score from close range.\nGerwyn Edwards was nowhere near to saving it, but\nno-one else would have been either so we'll let him\noff this time.\nAlso at Collier's Wood, the 2nds found themselves a goal down early on. Obviously Chelsea would have to\npay for daring to score so early, and in the ensuing 7-1\nthrashing they received, Pete Willey took his total this\nyear to 13 by grabbing a hat-trick.\nThe 3rds having made a flying start to the season,\nwith 7 points from 4 games and another 2 pts with a good win over a strong King's2 nd team. King's scored\nfirst, again this was after some slack marking in defence,\nbut the 3rds fought back strongly and eventually forced\nthe opposition to concede an own goal. The second half\nsaw more pressure on the King's goal and Russ Smith's hard work was rewarded when he scored after coming\nclose twice before. King's tried to come back after this\nbut the 3rd fought them off well to win by 2\u20141.\nThe 6th team, playing the side which was picked for\nthe first time this season, showed their true potential\nafter finding themselves a goal down against King's4 th s. Just as Chelsea 2nds paid for their affront e ry so did\nKing's. The annihilation which followed gave Mick\nWhitfield and Brian Causey hat-tricks, and although\nKing's scored a disputed goal, the result was 11-2 to\nI.C.6 th, which is the biggest score by any I.C. team this\nyear.\nR. KILL\nhockey\nOn a very cold afternoon at Harlingtoh the I.C. cup\nside had a simple passage into the second round of the\nU.L. Cup by beating Royal Free 5-2.\nFrom the start Royal Free were under almost continual pressure but most of the attacks broke down\naround the 25-yard line. In fact, it took ten minutes before the first goal came from John Schofield, converting\na cross from Dick Whittington. Soon after John Schofield added the second and I.C. became totally disinterested in the game.\nAllowed to attack, the spirited running of Royal Free\nproduced a few anxious moments around the home D and they eventually scored from a short corner that\nflew just inside the post. I.C. were again allowed to attack at will which resulted in Iki Kullar adding number\nthree a few minutes before half-time.\nThe second half was one big drag lasting for about an\nhour\u2014or so it seemed. I.C. managed to score two more\nfrom Iki Kullar \u2014 a penalty flick \u2014 and Jaz Missan,\nwhilst Royal Free were presented with the weekly gift-goal.\nA very scrappy game easily won by I.C. but concern\nmust be shown for the number of chances missed, lack\nof cohesion in attack and the complacency in defence.\nTEAM:\u2014 S. Boulton, G. Popple, D. Browne, D. Richman, J, Missan, C. Gaukroger, D. Whittington, S. Tucker, I. Kullar, J. Schofield, J. Astley.\nOn Saturday I.C.2 nd XI crawled to a41 win over\nQMC 2nds. Within three minutes, C. Gaukroger, making\na rare guest appearance, put one in the net. Unfortunately, for the rest of the match, he had great difficulty\nkeeping his feet. Towards the end of the first half Colin\nDyerfinishedafinerun down the left wing with a shot\nwhich made it 2-0. During the second half Dave Neal\nscored two excellent individual goals while the defence\nmanaged, in an incredible mix-up, to let on\u00a9 in.\nOn the same day l st XI went down 2\n\u2014\n1 to QMC\u2014\nJaz Gahir scoring\u2014whilst the 3rd XI lost to Woking by\nthe same score\u2014a report next week please.\nMIXED HOCKEY\nOn Sunday 12th November, I.C. mixed XI paid their\nannual visit to Guinness. Before the serious business\ncould begin, the hockey match was played in abysmal\nconditions and eventually ended in a11 draw.\nWith Wonder Boy in goal, I.C. wisely contrived to\nkeep the ball in the opposition's half and Sid Boulton\neven managed to score after about ten minutes of play.\nHowever, the superior player-power of Guinness caused,\non a few occasions, some concern inside I.C.'s25, but\nwith a little luck, the goal was kept intact until half-time.\nThe second half was much the same as the first with both sides going very close on occasions. Terry O 'Sullivan eventually beat the apprentice I.C. goalkeeper with\na close-range scoop to even the score.\nAfter the match the celebrations continued well into\nthe night: during which time Guinness\u2014and a few\nfrom I.C. \u2014were taught such games as fizz buzz and clap-clap with signs and numbers. Special mentions here\nfor Brian's lack of counting ability, Hazel's preoccupation with getting the chairman sloshed and, in parti-cula r, Janet Peacock's sign.\nWithout doubts this was one of the social games of\nthe season, so I extend thanks to Guinness, including\nHazel, Brian, Terry, Charles, Sue and Bernie, and the\nI.C. side: Dave, Mick, Pop, Bob, Helen, Janet, Tim,\nLinda and John, and especially to the Guinness lady\nwho played for I.C., but whose name I have forgotten.\nLADIES' HOCKEY\nWednesday, 15th November was indeed a beautiful\nday for I.C. Ladies Hockey. The sun shone at Harlington (and im a few other places, for that matter), and\nwe had a full team for about the first time this season.\nOur thanks are due to Christine Brown (of I. C.W. A. fame) who made a welcome return to the game and for\na guest appearance by Hilary Yates, the netball cap-tain.\nFor this was no ordinary match! This was a CUP\nMATCH! Eleven, eager I.C. W.S.C. Ladies, complete\nwith an umpire (it must have been a special occasion\nsince we don't normally have one) met to do battle\nwith University College Hospital in the first round of\nthe Cup.\nAn additional boost to the general air of enthusiasm\nwas received when it was learnt that UCH were one\nplayer short.\nI.C., therefore, were the stronger team from the start\nand used their eleven players to full advantage. Hilary\nRowson, sorry, Adams (Left Inner) soon opened the\nscoring after a mistake by the UCH defence and\nLynne Beynon (Centre Forward), playing in typical\ngood form, then made it 2\u20140. Towards the end of the\nfirst half, Chris Brown (Right Wing) scored from a corner.\nUCH started the second half in determined manner\nbut IC defence was never seriously threatened, dealing\nconfidently with any attacks. That most of the play was\nin the UCH half can be verified by the great number\nof corners in favour of IC and the fact that Jacqui\nBuzzard (Goalkeeper), nearly froze through inactivity\nduring the match. Anne Purvis (Centre Half) eventually\nsucceeded in scoring the goal that had eluded her in\nthe first half, thus making the final score: IC 4, UCH 0.\nTEAM: Chris Brown, Hilary Yates, Lynne Beynon,\nHilary Adams, Geraldine Bowden, Mary Hill, Ann\u00a9\nPurvis, Shirley Fairweather, Jane Purvis, Janet\nManfield (captain), Jacqui Buzzard.\nFelix no 319 Tuesday, November 21, 1972,\nEdited by Oliver F.

The days of\nthe extremist are fast dying\nand with it I.C.U. Student Unions at present\nare quite a Strong force; but\nthis force is not being directed properly. The power of\nthe i Student Unions should\nbe used Wholly for the benefit of the students (is not\nthis why they were formed?)\nand no it to Harass everyone\nelse.\nAt present I.C.U. is a political union; although it is not\nthe job of Ithe Union Executive to handle political and\nexternal affairs, 'they repeatedly appear [to be doing so.\nWhy then do we have an External Affairs Committee?\nThe answer is: so 'that it can\ntake the brunt of the load of\nexternal affairs from the\nPresident and to advise him\nonly on matters relevant\ndirectly to I.C.U. The President of I.C.U. should toe non-political him-self, yet toe 'able to'under-stand the views of everyone\nelse and from them decide\nwhich is the best action in\nthe particular case involved.\nAccommodation at the college should toe improved. At\npresent a new hall is a to out to be built at Northside; this\nis a Step in i the right direction but with the price of\nflats 'and digs ever in crea s ing, more space is needed\nimmediately; the houses on\nExhibition Road i back lng on\nthe Prince's 'Gardens should\nbe acquired whatever the\ncost and either pulled down\nin order to build a new\nhall on the site lor converted\nto Student Houses. Apart\nfrom new buildings, some of\nthe older residences should\nbe renovated; the work on\nStudent Houses is slow and\nwhen did Beit Hall last have\nan interior face lift?\nSocial life should be the\nmain concern of the Union\nbut it seems sadly neglected\nby the Executive. True the\nDeputy President runs the\nUnion Building but who was\nthe last President to take an\ninterest in Rag while he was\nin office. Perhaps the apathetic view of the Union is reflected toy the students; do\nthey have much interest in\nRag? . . . I don't even think\nthe Rag Committee has.\nJOHN\nLANE\nADRIAN\nSMITH\nWILLIAM\nF. WOOD\nLast year thousands of students were involved in militant actions against (the proposals of (the Tory government to weaken student\nunions. They won wide support land eventually succeeded in forcing i the temporary\nshelving of the Thatcher pro-pos als. If I.'C. Union were typical,\nthe Tories need not have\nbothered. Martin Black and\nthe present leading figures\nin the CCU's are quite capably rendering the union impotent without any help\nfrom Ted Heath.\nOf course, the reason the\nUnion is so feeble is that it\nnever takes any decision to\nfight for better conditions.\nWhy? Because it never even\ndiscusses them. Anything in\nthe least bit controversial is\nlabelled \"political\" and swept\nunder i the carpet. This saves\nembarrassing anyone with a soft Spot for the Conservative/Right-wing Tjafoour con-sens us. Further, it leaves\nbureaucrat tc ally minded officers, with plenty of time to\ncompile minutes, compile\nagendas and concoct plots\nfor keeping Piers Coribyn off\nNUS delegations all, of\ncourse, life and death issues\nfor IC students.\nPolitically-Demanding Bit\nThe \"anti-political\" argument is however fundamentally unsound. Issues like\ngrants, housing and autonomy will i bring us into conflict with the government,\nthe business interests who\nback them land the press.\nThus Whey are immediately\nand unavoidably political. To\nsuggest otherwise is word-play.\nIsn't it possible that a President with a little verve\nand a social interest in I.C. could Waken the place up,\nget more student participation in things for their enjoyment and less i student action against everyone else.\nCut out Ithe minority sport\nof running the Union, let\neveryone run it; have a president that wants everyone to\nrun it, a president that actually knows a few people, a president you can communicate with, a person with the\ngood of the student at heart.\nI shall 'Strive (if and when\nelected) to improve the lot\nof the Student at I.C. The\nonly thing that I will fight\nevery government for is a higher grant.\nYours Rightly and Leftily,\nIAN FARNELL\n(the man with the\ncourse down the\nmiddle)\nMain Issues\nThe issues I believe this\nunion should fight on are:\u2014\n'Grants: (a) at least \u00a3100\non the grant now\u2014to keep\nup with rising prices; (lb)\nFull gram for all students\u2014\nno dependence on parental\nincome; '(lc) No introduction\nof loans instead of grants;\n(d) Post-grads to get the\nLondon allowance which un-der-grads gelt.\nHousing: (a) launch an all-London campaign through\nNUS to force the DES to provide land and money for\nmore h'ail ls and student houses at the same fees; (b) to\nattack the general problem\nof London housing, which\naffects students especially\nacutely in the form of extortionate rents for third-rate\nrooms.\nAutonomy: (a) Resist\nThatcher's proposals, if they\nare re-introduced, by massive\nstudent actions; (to) Remove\nany union rules which give\nCollege authorities any right\nto 'interfere with our decisions;( c) support colleges\nWhere attacks on union have\nbeen made toy reactionary\nprincipals or vice-chancellors.\nRepresentation: What gains\nhave been made have been\nneutral is ed by the real dec i sion-making powers moving\nto higher committees with\nno students or because our\nrepresentatives haven't been\naccountable to union meet-in gs. Representation would\nalso toe more important if\nwe had something to say! An\nalternative policy for IC research 'and teaching should\nbe proposed on the principle\nthat science should serve the\nneeds of the people and not\nbe distorted and misused\nfor profit.\nFood: Mooney's catering is\na perennial problem with no\nsimple answer. It is also\ngetting worse because the\nGovernment has decreed that\nMooney must make la profit!\nPreconditions for improvements are (i) subsidies for\nrefs; (ii) more grants for\nstudents; (iii) more and bet-ter-paid staff.\nHow to win? Success on\ngrants and union autonomy\ncampaigns requires a vigorously led, nationwide campaign through NUS. We\nShould work to strengthen\nNUS especially at London\nregion level. Support from\nother sections who are being\nattacked toy the government\nespecially the Trade Unions,\nwill be a Crucial factor which\nmust toe patiently built up.\nThe first essential is to\narouse the students of IC\naround these demands. As a sabbatical president, I believe\nI can do this.\nThe main reason for standing again in these presidential elections is to fight to\nchange the currents of opinion in the union which\ncaused a re-election. Specifically this means 'the abstention is t view. To do this those\nissues most directly affecting\nstudents lat the moment must\nbe analysed, the links between these s hewn and also\nthe methods of effective action that students can take.\nThe last election campaign\nshowed that these issues are\nGrants, Housing, and Autonomy. The autonomy that the\nstudent union has is of overriding importance since it\ncontrols how effective any\naction we take is on the\nother issues.\nGrants:\u2014\u2022 two improvements in the grants system\nare urgently needed now.\nOne is a rise in the total\nand i the other a removal of\nthe dependence upon parental contributions. The pay\nfreeze 'that exists at the moment will toe the first argument (brought against these\nchanges. This only highlights\nthe clear perspective that\nStudents must have. It is\nonly united workers action\nthat is going to smash the\nfreeze and lit is only united\nstu der it i worker action that is\ngoing to change the grant\nsituation. This means that\nstudents must support any\nworkers' action directed\nagainst the freeze and work\ntowards workers' support of\nstudent action. Since we\ncannot expect big business\nto stop prices rising nor the\ntoken handful of civil servants lit is imperative 'that\nwe take action ourselves\nalong with Other workers. In\ncollege students can take\nthe initiative toy (boycotting\nrefectories if there are price\nrises. We must toe clear\nthough that the workers in\nthe refectories do not suffer\nin order to keep our prices\ndown. Neither workers nor\nstudents must accept responsibility for any increases.\nThere are groups working\noutside of college to try and\ndo this and they must be\nsupported to make this practice general and therefore\neffective.\nHousing: Students are finding the housing situation\naffecting them in two main\nways. Those in hall find\nthemselves paying for the\ncost of future buildings\n(when these do come we\nfind them being built \"on\nthe cheap\"\u2014we need just\nlook at Northside where\nagain it will be the students\nthat suffer). Those not in a hall are paying excessively\nhigh rents for poor 'accommodation. At the moment nine\ncolleges in the country are\non 'rent 'strike'. This is an\nessential first step and one\nshould toe organised here if\nthere is any increase. These\nhowever must have a perspective of broadening such\naction outside the student\nfield.\nTo help those Students not\nin hall i the union must support groups, such as the\nNetting Hill housing association and tenants associations\nthat are working to change\nthe situation. These must be\nsupported because they\nclearly a how where the responsibility for the housing\nsituation lies and so are directing their efforts in support of i those With housing\ndifficulties and against Ithe\nsystem and its laws.\nThe autonomy of the union\nis needed for Students to organise these activities. At the\nmoment there are no specific government attacks but\nthis is no time for complacency. At 'the moment college authorities are attacking\nindividual unions up and\ndown the (country. To defend\nour autonomy we must both\ndefend these unions in\nStruggle >and use what autonomy we have. It has already\nbeen shown on the specific\nissues of grants and housing\nhow our autonomy can best\nbe used. That is in united\naction with the economic\npower of the working class.\nThat means that in order to\nbe of any good to students\nthe union must take up a class line in all struggles.\nI would like to thank Felix\nfor (this chance to present\nmy Manifesto to the 'Students\nof I.C. My n lame is Bill 'Wood. My\npolicies and thoughts\u2014which\nI Will do my best to implement if I am elected\u2014are\nthese:\n(1) I shall not lead the\nunion members, they Will\nlead me, and I Will do my\nbest to toe a representative to\nyou, on your i be hi alf.(2) The cliquish ness of the\nexec, shall toe to irl oken down to an acceptable level. Alt Ithe\nmoment, the top end of 'the\nunion is entombed in a rigid\ncase, a situation which is\nobviously harmful and bad\nfor those thousands outside\nthe clan.\n(3) CJC.U.S might try to\nrestrict their roles (to being\nentertainment facilities. At\nthe moment they are taking\nmatters, like that of the\nevent at 'Stirling University,\nas their own concern, and'\ntaking damaging action on\nthese matters. This should\nnot really be part of\ntheir job, and I will try to\ndiscourage them thinking it\nis.\n(4) The C.C. Us also did\nmuch harm to I.C.U. by supporting very vigorously the\nidea that to abstain in the\nlast presidential election\nwould toe fun. This was\nreally quite w rion g, because\nit swayed the voters into\nabstaining rather than just\nnot vote, as i they would\nprobably have done.\n(5) 'The functioning of the\ncollege and of union entertainments will continue as\nbefore\u2014there is no reason (to\ninterfere. Various social and\nacademic sub-com milt it ees, amenities are doing good,\nand need not i be altered in\nany way by union action.\n(6) Now the usual argument that I.C.U. will not be\npolitical in any way\u2014connected With N.U.S., yes\u2014but\nnot political. I don't mind\npolitical extremists airing\ntheir views, but I object to\nthem using their power,\ngranted (to them for one reason or another, to impress\nthese views.\n(7) My 'policies are not\nrigid\u2014far from it\u2014they will\nbe altered if necessary by\ngeneral desire or demand. In\nfact I hope that the union\nwill act for the 'students in\nthe way in which ALL of the\nstudents want it to. That is\nboth post grads and~ under-grads, including of course\nfirst years.\n(8) I hope that this time\nthere will not be a terrific\nwave of apathy in the voting,\nand thai one of the candidates gets the job. I sincerely hope also that it is\nthe best man for the job,\nfor it is a post of very great\nresponsibility.\n'(9) This is supposed to 'be\na manifesto, but if I may\nhave licence to say this to\nthe first years\u2014you can win\nthe election, for there are\naround 800 of you. If you\nwant (\na union president that\nWill truly represent you, las\nweill as Ithe rest of the col-le ge,i al her than just the\ntop end, then it is within\nyour power to have one.\nThank you.\n(10) I have tried to toe\nmercifully short and straightforward in this rendering but\nif I haven't,I must apologise. Felix has printed this word\nfor word, mistakes included,\nso I must ask you to forgive\nthe toad gram i mer and poor\nspelling.\nMy thanks again to Felix.\nBILL WOODS\nElec. Eng. I "
