Even the flying\nscenes are pretty rope y \u2014not recommended.\nThe re-release of Fantasia ( U, Odeon Haymarket) with a completely new digital\nsoundtrack is a welcome move. This was\nDisney at his best: creative, innovative and\nentertaining. The film is actually quite shallow,\nbeing no more than a series of pretty pictures\ngo with some marvellous music, but it's meant\nto be nothing more.\nThe new soundtrack is beautifully clear\u2014sit\nback and enjoy it.\nOne of the biggest money earners of the\nmonth was the \" raunchiest movie about\ngrowing up\", Porky's(X, selected Odeons).\nThis film resembles a more explicit version of\nAnimal House, and concerns the sexual misadventures of a group of American teenage s. There are a few laughs here and\nthere but never anything which could be\ntermed clever. Twentieth Century Fox are\nnow releasing a second teenage film called\nPuberty Blues. What next?\nMark Smith\nThe Secret of Nimh (Cert U) The Secret of Nimh is a full-length children's cartoon made by Don Bluth and and a group\nof Disney animators who became disillusioned\nwith the Disney stereotype and decided to set\nup on their own.\nIt is clear that the group owes a lot to\nDisney. The use of colour and music and the\nanimation were more or less exactly as I remember Disney cartoons (although it's a long time since I 've seen one) but this is no\ncriticism; for this type of film it is exactly what's required. 's The main improvement is in the plot, which\nmanages to avoid the awful predictability of\nDisney. Mrs Brisby, a recently widowed lady\nmouse, has to move her house and children\nfrom the field which is about to be ploughed.\nWhile enlisting help from Jeremy, the over-' enthusiastic crow and the can take rous Auntie\nShrew she begins to realise there is another,\nmuch bigger concern which keeps posing all\nkinds of awkward questions: Who are the Rats\nof Nimh? Why is the chemist mouse, Mr Ages, so secretive about his work? And why\ndoes everyone revere her late husband so\ngreatly and how did he die? It is only as Mrs B begins to investigate the rats and eventually\nmeets the awesome Nicodemus (with a superb\nvoice supplied by Derek Jacobi) that she\nlearns the answers to her questions and\nrealises the magic power of her husband's amulet.\nIt is this intrigue in the film, the idea that\nthere are always questions which 'we don't know the answer to yet' together with the fact\nthat the comedy in the film is not slapstick but\ncomes more from interaction of the animals'\ncharacters, which makes it so enjoyable.\nOne criticism: I found the ending a little too\nincredible, even within the fantasy context of\nthe film as a whole. And I was surprised at a couple of sequences whose only purpose\nseemed to be as anti-vivisection propaganda.\nTo sum up then, it is really a children's film,\nalbeit a fine one and not really worth going out\nof your way to see. On the other hand if you\ncan find an excuse to take a group of eight-year-olds to the cinema, don't hesitate.\nMartin S Taylor\nA still from Fantasia\nTheatre\nThe Admirable Bashville, The Dark Lady\nof the Sonnets and a Midsummer Night's Dream, presented by the New Shakespeare Company at the Open Air Theatre,\nRegent's Park.\nThe Admirable Bashville is an unusually\npure distillation of Sh avian silliness. A romantic s qui b set in the old empire days, it\nconcerns a refined lady of letters who instantly\nfalls in love with a boxer jogging through the\ngrounds of her house. Plots rarely come as silly\nas this. Among elements featured in the plot\nare: the lady's butler, Bashville, whose love of\nhis mistress secretly pent up in his breast is\nvented in an eruption of anguish and disgust\non realising his lady's passion for a mere boxer\n(silly), a boxing match that continues long after\nthe contestants have left the ring (slightly silly),\nand a head-on collision between some African\nA silly scene from Shaw's The Admirable Bashville.\nsavages and members of the English aristocracy (incredibly silly).\nBernard Shaw wrote The Admirable\nBashville to prove a point. He boasts: \"I took\nthe opportunity of producing a masterpiece to\nshow that I had the Shakespeare technique at\nmy fingers' ends' if I chose to use it. Also, I wanted to give a practical proof of what I had\nso often alleged \u2014 that it is the easiest\ntechnique in the world.\" The result is a ridiculous but amusing orgy of words. Fine\nperformances are given by Emily Richard and\nPeter Woodward as the lady and boxer respectively. And by Douglas Hodge as the\npoor butler.\nThe silliness of The Admirable Bashville is\nsurpassed only by the cheekiness of The Dark\nLady of the Sonnets (the two plays are\npresented as a double-bill). This play is even\nmore liable to upset lovers of Shakespeare. In\nthis short work, Shakespeare( David Whitworth) intrudes upon the premises of\nQueen Elizabeth I( Helen Ryan), and makes an\nappeal for an establishment of a National\nTheatre. But Shaw's portrayal of Shakespeare\nis definitely not gratifying; the great dramatist\nseizes upon and ecstatically jots down the\nmost banal phrases lightly uttered by the\nQueen, in the way a dishevelled tramp would\nstoop down and gleefully pick up odd fag ends.\nA 'dark lady' also appears in this humorous\nplay (played by Janet Spencer-Turner)\u2014the\nDark Lady so often referred to in Shakesp e are' s sonnets and who causes much unhappiness.\nThe production of A Midsummer Night's Dream is now reviewed( for those Shakespeare lovers who have managed to\nread this far). The very best Puck in the land\nhas been secured for this production: Christopher Biggins. Biggins is best known to\nthe public for the big brand of villi an he has\ncreated after his appearance as Nero in BBC TV's award-winning / Claudius. Possessing the\nappearance of an overgrown schoolboy slob,\nhe plays a rotund, mischievous, mushroom-chomping Puck.\nThe Dream is a complex play which has\ninspired many, including seekers of the\nsupernatural. The fairies, sprites and spirits (or\nelemental s as they are called by present day\nrespectability-seeking mystics) have always\namused or tant ali sed people down the ages.\ncontinued on page 7.\nPage 6 FELIX, July 30, 1982\n\n"

However, the best offering of the months\ncomes from a small independent distributor\nand is only showing at one cinema.\nWerner Herzog' s Fitzcarraldo ( A, Camden Plaza) is remarkable in many ways. It\ncontinues this director's long association with\nthe extraordinary Klaus Kinski who stars as\nBrian Sweeny Fitzgerald( known as Fitzcarraldo because nobody can pronounce\nhis name), an Irishman attempting to make his\nfortune in Peru at the turn of the century. He has one lifelong obsession: to build an opera\nhouse in the jungle and bring his beloved opera\nto the Indians, but first he must obtain the\nmoney.\n* After several unsuccessful enterprises,\nFitzcarraldo hits upon a fantastic scheme\nwhich involves dragging a massive riverboat\nover a hill between two rivers. This unlikely\nevent provides the centre piece of an epic film\nwhich chronicles one man's obsessive struggle\nagainst nature to achieve his goal.\nIt is beautifully filmed, with Herzog making\ngreat use of his South American locations. To add to this Kin ski gives another great\nperformance in the lead role, with strong\nsupport from the rest of the cast (including the\nAmazonian Indians). An interesting, awe-inspiring story completes the creative cycle.\nI can't say that the film is exciting (in the\n'action' sense at least), but it's strong images\nheld my attention and interest for the full two\nand a half hour running time.\nThe fact that Herzog actually moved a full-size riverboat over a hill makes it an even more\nimpressive and fascinating achievement.\nGrotesque caricatures drawn from the mind\nof Pink Floyd's Roger Waters populate the\nscreen a dap at ation of their hugely successful\ndouble album The Wall ( A A, Empire Leicester Square).

Floyd' s music is left to tell the story while a combination of live action and occasional piece\nof Gerald Scarfe's excellent animation give\nflesh to the ideas contained therein.\nPink's life seems to have been one of\ncontinual hardship; he loses his father, is\nsmothered by his loving mother, gets\nhumiliated at school and ends up losing his\nwife to another man. In desperation he locks\nhimself into his room and attempts to retract\nfrom the real world until he verges on insanity.\nNeedless to say all this sounds pretty\nstandard rockstar fare, but Alan Parker and\nGerald Scarfe manage to create real nightmares\non the screen which succeed in making The\nWall a dynamic (and occasionally breath-taking) film. If you enjoyed the album you'll\nprobably love it and if not, it may change your\nmind.\nThe first of the batch of science fiction\nbiggies which will descend on the country in\nthe next few months is Star Trek II: The\nWrath of Khan (A, selected ABC s). Khan( Ricardo Mont alban) is a genetic\nsuperman left stranded on a planet by Captain\nKirk in one of the TV episodes. He is\nunwittingly discovered by Commander Chekov\nand commandeers his ship to seek revenge on\nKirk, who is now an Admiral.\nIn the best traditions of the series Admiral\nKirk has coincidentally left his desk on earth\nand is accompanying Captain Spock on a training mission aboard The Enterprise. When\nKhan steals a deadly device named Project\nGenesis, The Enterprise, with its largely\ninexperienced crew, is sent to the rescue once\nmore.\nThe comic book storyline is, unfortunately,\nnot accompanied by a well paced and exciting\nscreenplay. The film drags at times and the\ndirection is a little flat, but despite this (or\nperhaps because of this) the magic of the\ntelevision show, as embodied in all the main\ncharacters, shines through.

    "content": "Captains\nof\nIndustry?\nby Nick Pyne\nFollowing the Finniston Report four years ago\nImperial College started on an ambitious plan\nto introduce four year courses, combining\nmany of the good points of a three year BSc\nwith an MSc in management to follow, and\nwith a greater leaning towards the needs of\nmanufacturing industry. In June the first\ngraduates in chemical engineering left College.\nThis is a personal appraisal of the successes\nand failures of the course, written from the\npoint of view of a chemical engineer. I apologise for any generalisations or in ac curacies.\nCommitment The commitment of departments to these\ncourses has always been somewhat suspect. A sizeable minority of academics were against\nthe idea from the start (even if not vocally so),\nand there seems to have arisen a conflict of\ninterest fairly early on. Some academics saw\nthe 4 Y C as a chance to cram more technical\nknowledge in to the poor students. Whilst this\nwas one aim, it was not to be a major part;\nmost of the extra time was intended to be\ntaken up with management and DSE S courses. However, the departments seem to\nhave considered these to be definitely\nsubsidiary subjects (a glance at the subject\nexamination weightings will confirm this),\nsomething to be done in \"spare time\" and have\nthus set workloads accordingly. The DMS and\nDSE S, faced with this, attempt to set courses\nwith sufficient work to give a good under-standing, but find that students who are short\nof time simply ignored them. The low turn out\nat lectures and tutorials reflects not only the\nattitude of the students, but that of the\ndepartments.\nThe commitment of the students must also\nbe questioned. At the point of leaving school\nthe choice of course is somewhat arbitrary,\nand four years does not seem as daunting as it\nmight. Yet four years of all study and no play\n(what most people find necessary to stay on\ntop of work) is more than most students can\nface. The result? A high drop out rate leaving\nonly the more academically inclined and able\nto complete the course. Those who chose to\nstick it out against the odds are likely to come\nout disillusioned and with a poor class of\ndegree.\nIndustry\nLet us look, then, at the main aim of the\nexercise. Are graduates really going to be\nof more help to industry? Here chemical\nengineering differs from the other departments\nin that it does not run a purely sandwich\ncourse. For Chem Eng the periods of the\nsummer spent in industry seem to serve\nmainly to point out how little of the theory\nderived at College we are ever likely to use and\nto erode our motivation even further.\nIndustry, too, is beginning to question the\nvalidity of the course. Amongst this year's graduates it seemed that a BEng was no\nsignificant advantage, and the decreasing >\nnumber of firms prepared to sponsor students\nfor the course suggests that no-one is fooled\nby the reality behind the aim.\nOne of the major criticisms in the Finniston\nReport was that courses were designed to turn\nout academics, and that courses should be\ndesigned with much more practical application.\nYet the promise that \"there is nothing in the .\nthree year course that isn't in the four year\ncourse\" clearly indicates that there has been\nlittle attempt to modify the core material, and\nthat the extra courses are simply a cosmetic\nicing to give the show of greater applicability.\nThe future of four year courses is somewhat\nin doubt. It is already rumoured that one\ndepartment is to drop the four year course\naltho get her, and chemical engineering is\nintroducing a different 4 Y C which will just be a super-academic all-technical wonder (one asks\nif this is really what they wanted all along?).\nCould it be that soon 4 Y C graduates will be of\nless use to industry rather than more?\nYet surely there must be some good to\nthese courses? Indeed there is. The departments have been able to use the 4 Y C to\nmaintain their prestigious positions with 1\nrespect to other institutions in the country,\nand a considerable amount of extra investment\nhas been forthcoming. For the students? Well,\nthere's the different letters after your name,\nand another year at the state's expense....But\nthen who cares about us anyway?\nDear Martin\nLexers\nto %e Editor\nDear Martin\nThe author of the\" We shall not be moved?\" article\nof FELIX618, when writing about the possible move of the\nUnion to Southside advocates\na\" firm decision( by the Union) at the earliest possible\nopportunity, even if the College\ndoes not give further details.\" The biasing of this article is a clear\nattempt to stir us into opp osi tion. But can we afford to\nprejudge the issue? In spite of\nthe College's obsession al secrecy ( which we must fight\non as important a topic as\nthis) the move may well be in our best interest and demands careful attention.\nThe only criteria on which we should judge are:\n1. The quality and quantity of facilities that the Union will be able to provide its\nmembers( including any dim inuit ion due to the move's appropriation of finance).\n2. The quality and quantity of academic facilities which the College will provide Union members, ie improved first year Life Sciences labor a tories.\n3. The working conditions\nof Union employees.\nNostalgia and tradition stand for nothing. The opinions of a few (or ' many') furious life members are totally irrelevant. It is with reason that they are explicitly prevented from having any voting power within the Union. The Union is for us,\nits student members. Further more, nostalgia within the\nstudent body is also irrelevant.\nVery few of us will still be\nmembers in three years time.\nWhat will future students think if they are deprived of\nfacilities merely because we\nremember affectionately the\nmany pints we supped in the\nUnion Bar.I do not support the move;\nI have insufficient information at my disposal. I object to the\nconservatism mingled with supposition with which the\narticle's author is trying to\nprompt us into an ill conceived, premature judge ment.\nTim Pig den Dear Martin\nA matter has recently come to my attention which I feel\nmust be raised with your readers. Namely the perpetration of a massive fraud on Imperial College Union. Last week it transpired that\nthe man known to us for many years as \" Nick Morton\" is none other than the notorious\" Ralph Incognito\". I discovered this when in the\nUnion Bar\" Nick\" or rather,\nRalph, told me:\" Morton isn't my real name, it isn'ton my birth certificate. Never has been.\" In consideration of such\nrevelations I must demand that Mary Freeman be posit iv ely vetted immediately, and at regular intervals thereafter; say about twice a week.\nTours sincerely Jon Barnett We li are Officer, I CUPS: I should not like to offer\nmy services for the above task.\nWhy is it that the owners of\nthe Head Tenancies of\nLex ham and Hamlet Gardens show a distressing lack of initiative when dealing with students' mail that arrives after the end of term?\nThe Students' Services assure us that these conscientious owners dutifully return all mail to sender (if possible).\nOf what use is that? Surely it\nwould be easier( and of greater benefit to us) for the\nmail to be collected and sent\nen masse to IC. Tours faithfully\nAli sonG Fraser Dear Martin\nCongratulations on your first ' new look' FELIX. We could not however help but\nnotice that the Victorian gentleman typing on this page\nbears an uncanny resemblance to yourself. Just cine\nquestion.

Its\ndiscovery so close to home has\ncaused considerable embarrassment to both the old and the new\nExecs, who must either now accept that the security of the\nUnion Office is extraordinarily\nlax since it has been broken into\ntwice in two months, or else\nadmit that their repeated search-ing for the micrometer was\nsingularly ineffective.\nRumour Indeed, the incoming Exec\ntried to suppress the story of\nwhere Mike was found, relating\ninstead another rumour that it\nhad been found elsewhere.\nMr Reeves, College Chief Security Officer, had suspected\nthat Mike could still be in the\nUnion Building, and the day\nbefore it was found he also\nsearched the building but didn't look in the Union Office itself\nsince he assumed it had been\nthoroughly searched by the\nUnion staff.\nMike, back in the safe in the\nCollege Security Office.\nPhoto: Dave W Parry\nUnion still without\nDP as Greenstreet\nfails exams\nLate in June the Union was thrown into turmoil when Deputy Presidentelect Phil Greenstreet failed his third year Physics exams. The Union\nConstitution requires its officers to achieve \"academic standing\" and so\nMr Greenstreet is unable to take up the post.\nIt was hoped that Mr Greenstreet could register for a course next\nyear, allowing him to stand for re-election early in the autumn term.\nNegotiations between Nick Morton, Steve Gould er and College\nresulted in the idea being accepted, and several departments were\napproached. Despite an initially hopeful response from the\ndepartments of Physics and Metallurgy, no department would accept\nhim, since offering a place to someone who would immediately leave\nto take up a sabbatical appointment would in effect waste a vacancy\nfor the new intake.\nAt present Nick Morton and Christine Teller are performing the\nDeputy President's duties, but there will have to be elections at the\nbeginning of the session to find a permanent replacement for Mr Greenstreet. Papers will go up in the first week of next term, with\nhustings and elections in the third and fourth weeks. However, the poor turn out for the last elections and the likely\ninexperience of much of the electorate (about one third will be\nfreshmen and have little experience of the Union, and may consequently not vote) begs the question of whether the elections will\nbe quo rate, and if so what sort of candidate will be successful.\nThe last time a sabbatical officer\nfailed was three years ago when\nJohn Shuttleworth, FELIX Editor-elect, failed his second\nyear maths exams. At that time\nit was not explicitly part of the\nConstitution that sabbaticals had to be of academic standing;\nMr Shuttleworth took the Union to court, but lost his case.\nSuccesses\nThe other sabbaticals did somewhat better; Martin Taylor,\nthe new FELIX Editor, is a postgraduate and was declared\nof academic standing by his\nsupervisor, while President Steve\nGould era ndH on Sec Mary Freeman graduated with a lower\nsecond and a third respectively.\nPhil Greenstreet\nNo. 619 Friday, July 30,1982 Free!\n\n"

Already the more\nobservant of you will have noticed that the\nnews pages are in a different typeface, Times,\nwhich is both clearer and easier to print than\nBaskerville which we used before.\nThe FELIX Advertising Manager Nick Thexton has been designing a new masthead\n(the bit at the top of the front page) and this\nwill head the next issue. But so as not to keep\nyou.in suspense, a black and white version is\nreproduced on this page.\nMike\nThe mascot is now returned and the Union are\nstill clueless as to who 'borrowed' it. May I use\nthis column to offer him (her?) my congratulations. I have found the whole escapade very\nfunny, and I wish others had the wit to\nhighlight the Union's failings in such amusing\nways.\nSoapbox Golly! I hope all the soapboxes this year are as\nhard-hitting and controversial as Nick Pyne's. And I'm sure lots of people will want to take\nissue with Nick's views\u2014copy deadline for the\nnext FELIX is Friday 13 August.\nImpossible without\nNick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Peter, Peter, Steve,\nSteve, Mark, Dave, Pallab (for trying), Chris,\nLinda, Maz, all the people who took me at my\nword and actually got round to telling me the\ninteresting things which were happening\naround College, Izy and the colla tors, and the\nfolding machine which has promised to behave\nitself tonight, since this is my first issue.\nMartin S Taylor\nOn the departure of the Lower Lounge\nand Nick Morton\nSo, farewell then\nUnion\nLower Lounge Partition\nDemolished\nWhile still\nIn your prime\nYou were\nBig and\nThick\nAnd wooden and\nLasted barely a year\nJust like Nick\nEJ Smith (17)\nPINCCXMIC\nRichard, Steve and Tim are three mathematicians of whom you will hear a great deal\nmore in the future. One is a pure mathematician, one a statistician and the third an\napplied mathematician. I'm sure you know the\nsituation by now\u2014the pure mathematician\ntells only the strict, rigorous truth, the\nstatistician tells alternately lies and the truth\nand the applied mathematician always lies.\nI was sitting in the Maths Common Room\nthe other day the three of them came in. Len\nhad recently retired from the lecturing staff,\nand a dispute arose as to how long Len,\nMichael, Norman, Oliver and Peter had been\non the staff.\nRichard spoke first. \"Norman has been\nhere the longest,\" he said.\n\"That's as may be,\" said Tim, \"but Peter\ndefinitely arrived before Oliver.\"\n\"I know Norman arrived before Michael,\nanyway,\" continued Richard, ignoring Tim as\nusual.\n\"Michael arrived after Peter,\" said Tim.\nSteve shook himself out of his post-lecture\nsleep to mutter, \"Michael arrived before Len.\"\n\" And Len arrived before Oliver,\" said\nRichard.\n\"Oliver wasn't the last to arrive, though,\"\nSteve replied.\nI knew which discipline each belonged to, I knew that the first statement the statistician\nhad made was true, and this knowledge,\ncoupled with the fact that no two lecturers\nhad arrived simultaneously enabled me to\ndetermine with complete certainty the order\nin which the staff had arrived.\nWhat was that order?\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me\nat the FELIX Office, please. There is a prize\nof \u00a35 (donated by Mend-a Bike) for the\ncorrect entry randomly selected at 1:00pm on\nWednesday.\nWelcome to the first puzzle that I 've set. I shall, as this coming year's Puzzles Editor, be\nmaking a full statement in the first FELIX of\nnext term.

    "content": "Puck (Christopher Biggins) and Hermia (Janet Spencer-Turner) in A Midsummer Night's Dream.\nThe play is essentially about.human love in its\nvarious forms, but especially in that sudden,\nalmost unreal, love that results in mutual\nfascination and infatuation from the very first\nglance.\nThe Open Air Theatre is of course a superb\nplace to stage this play, what with its trees and\nflowery banks, winding paths, grotto and\ntunnel. Well-placed loudspeakers among the\ntrees and in an old tree stump on the grassy\nstage are used to good effect to recreate the\nsuperbly fleeting and ethereal substance of\nfairies (whizzing sounds are generated that\nseem to the ear to fly over the audience). An imaginative use of light after the sun has set\nadds to the dream quality of the play, producing in the viewer confusion as to what is\nreal and unreal, what is a dream and what isn't. The element of visual humour in the play is\nstrong, and whilst this delighted children in the\naudience, it did perhaps upset the balance of\nthe play, especially towards the end. Dialogue\nfrom the loudspeakers was often unclear.\nThe Shaw double bill, A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Taming of the Shrew\n(reviewed in FELIX618) are in repertoire until\nthe end of the season on 28 August.\nNick Bedding\nWALKABOUTLOOKSee\nby Mobile Optics Inc.\nDescended from both Tamburlaine the Great\nand Genghis Khan, the ' Grand. Mughals'\nconjure up visions of fairy-tale wealth and\nsplendour. The greatest of these Muslim\nemperors ruled India, father and son, for\nnearly two centuries. They were soldiers,\nscholars, and patrons of the arts. Under\nAkbar, a contemporary of Elizabeth I, their\nempire covered the whole of Northern India\nand part of the Deccan. They created an\nadministrative system which stabilized India,\nmade it a major world power of its day and\nwas capable of projecting, even in its eventual\ndissolution, an ideal of unity: administrative\ndevices developed by the Mughals retained\ntheir influence, and were taken over by the\nBritish.\n-hold on, just a minute what's a paragraph like the one above doing in FELIX?\nAnd, maybe more to the point, what is\n\" walk about look see\"? Perhaps a word of\nexplanation is in order, before we proceed. If\nmy feet can be relied on to perform their\nallot ed task, and the editor is kind enough to\nput up with my highly erratic punt u ation, I hope that a London walk about column will\nbecome a regular feature of FELIX this year.\nThe articles will be written after visiting a current exhibition or seeing an interesting\npart of a museum's permanent collection (say\nthe Egyptian mummies at the British Museum); and so, some will be' about the\nslightly tourist y things one never quite seems\nto get round to, when one's actually living in\nLondon; and some will be a bit more specialist \u2014 that means there' ll be an\nadmission charge (!) but with a discount for\nflashing a student's card. I hope that the\narticles will be entertaining to read and that\nyou, like me, will find walk about look see an\nenjoyable alternative to the umpteenth lab\nreport or problem sheet.\nto resume: The' Indian Heritage' exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum\nsets out to recapture the spectacular opulence of the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncentury courts of the 'Grand Mughal', as he\nwas known throughout Europe. As well as\nbeing a survey of the decorative and fine arts\nof India before the Raj, the exhibition looks at\nthe lifestyle of the emperors themselves and\nof the Maharajas of Hindu India, and the\nNawabs, lesser rulers who rose to power as\nthe Mughal Empire declined, in the eighteenth\ncentury.\nThe design of the opening section gives the\nimpression of walking through a building in\nAkbar's Royal City of Fatehpur Sikri; you\nlook out through 'windows' whose openwork\nsandstone screens are carved in ingenious\ngeometric patters, each one different. A series\nof watercolours shows how, during the two\ncenturies of Mughal rule, Hindu and Muslim\narchitectural styles fused and developed\nSilver Huqqa base-for smoking through!\ntogether; from Akbar's sandstone palaces\nwith their traditionally Indian beams and\nbrackets, to the monuments of his grandson,\nShah Jahan (the builder of the Taj Mahal),\nglittering white marble, be jewelled with\ndecorative inlay, and the characteristic outlines of domes and arches.\nThe exhibition is extremely well laid out and\neach part suggests a different atmosphere as\nwell as displaying a collection of beautiful\nobjects. The ceremony of the magnificent\ndaily Durbar\u2014when the emperor sat out 'to\nsee and to be seen'\u2014is illustrated with the\n'Golden Throne of Rangit Singh' set on a splendid carpet, surrounded by bright tent\nhangings, a peacock feather fan, ceremonial\nfly wis k(!) and gilded spears and standards.\nWhen the imagination fails, details can be\nfound in the exquisite miniatures painted by\ncourt artists. There's a charming one of a lady\nin the imperial 'zen an a'( harem) playing with a yoyo!\nGreat luxury must have been taken for\ngranted at court, but the overwhelming impression of this exhibition is not so much of\nself-indulgence, as of delight for being surrounded by beautiful things. A love of fresh,\nbright colours and of nature obviously went\nhand-in-hand with high standards of craft man ship. Intricate floral designs are to be found\neverywhere: on cotton floor spreads and Kashmir shawls, in the semi-precious inlay of\nmarble panels, in the painted enamel decoration of a flintlock gun, even on the\nbarrel of a small bronze cannon. Akbar's biographer described the interiors of the\nimperial.pavilions as 'beautiful flower beds'; if\nthe objects on display on anything to go by, I can well believe him!\nThe exhibition continues until 15 August,\nadmission 50p for students (otherwise \u00a31.50).\nThe V&A is open on weekdays from 10:00 till\n17:30, Sundays 14:30 till 17:30, and closed\nevery Friday.\nFELIX, July 30, 1982 Page 7\n\n"
