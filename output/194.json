    "content": "10 FELIX RUGBY\nFRESHERS IMPRESSIVE\n\"Old Lags\" must train to stay\nMany of last year's players\nwill have to fight for their places\nthis season. This was the reaction of Rugby club selectors following the trials during the first\nweek of term at which no less\nthan 65 fresher s were on view\nand showed an encouragingly\nhigh standard of play.\nWednesday's trials saw the\ntalent revealed for the first time\nin two hard fought games. These\nweer followed by a20 minute\n\"Old Lags\" exhibition. The\nmost re eva ling feature of this\nlatter match was the sorry state\nto which most of the \"Lags\" had\nbeen reduced by the end.\nNot surprisingly, captain Alan\nHavard decreed training for the\nfollowing day and Thursday\nlunchtime saw 45 brave souls assembled in the gym. Old members worried about their places\nThe athlete on tour is faced\nwith a dilemma : to give of his\nbest on track or field with religious dedication, or to enjoy\nthe spontaneous hospitality of\nhis hosts to the fulL\nFor the two are not compatible as was experienced many\ntimes during our German visit\nwhen the morning after the night\nbefore was more often than not,\nthe morning before the after-noon's match-It is in the light of this dilemma that the black and white\nstatistics of this tour should be\njudged. Of four matches contest-ed, at Frankfurt, Gottingen,\nBrunswick, and Heidelberg,\nfour were lost. However the\nmargin of defeat in all but one\nwas small. This was the needle\nmatch of the season between\ntwo of the more proficient\nteams in Germany, those of Gottingen University and Darmstadt\nCollege. As a result, although\nthis match produced our best\nperformances of the tour, we\nwere in the 400 m in 48.5. Ted\nWilkins who won the 1,500 m in 4.00.4 and Dave Colvin with\na personal best 800m of 1.55.2.\nwere there\u2014so were fresher s keen to take their chance.\nThe final trial on Saturday\nwas eagerly awaited by players\nand selectors alike and despite\nthe rain, Harlington was filled\nwith blue and black jerseys. It\nwas pleasing to note the quality\nof performances, especially that\nof the first team which showed\nexperience all round and razor\nkeene s s in places.\nPositions will be difficult to\nsecure this season and it is clear\nthat constant training is going\nto be a vital factor in the life of\nevery aspiring first and second\nteam player. This is, however,\nan atmosphere from which both\nthe club and the college will\nbenefit and should bring the\nUniversity knockout cup back to\nI.C. Result: Wednesday 9th1 st XV v\"M\" division Met. Police\n54-0.\nIt is ominous to note that these\nthree have now left I.C. Socially every fixture was a great success. At each university\nwe were left in no doubt that we\nwere welcome, no efforts were\nspared to provide for our comfort and entertainment. Tours\nwere laid on for us, parties arranged with plenty of Nordic\nfemale talent supplied and facilities provided for training, bas-ket ball, football, and swimming.\nIn addition Frankfurt, Brunswick and Heidelburg blessed us\nwith some blazing sunshine in\nwhich to roast our pali d selves.\nFull U.L. Purples have been\nawarded to Bill Wood and Paul\nClifton and a Half Purple to\nTed Wilkins as a result of their\nperformances on the track for\nthe university team this season\u2014\nCongratulations.\nAthletics trials for the University Relay and Field Events\nchampionships will be held on\nWednesday 30th October at\nHarlington track. All prospective participants must attend.\nWatch the Athletic club notice\nboard.\nBASKETBALL\nl.C. AIMS\nHIGH\nYou do not need to be a seven\nfoot American college graduate\nor on playing terms with the\nGlobetrotters to become a successful member of the I.C. Basketball Club. Indeed, even\nwithout such giants the club\nusually has a high standard of\nplay as our record of holding\nthe Links Trophy twice in the\nlast four years will testify.\nThe club hopes to field two\nsquad this year\u2014the first playing competitive ball in the\nU.L. U. League and Division I of the London League, and the\nsecond squad playing mainly\nfriendlies. Games are played on\none or two nights a week with\nour home night being Fridays at\nour court in Stepney.\nIf anyone is at all interested\nin playing basketball this year\nwould they please contact the\nCaptain or Secretary, via the\nUnion Rack.\nSWIMMING\nTOUR\nThis summer the Swimming\nClub embarked on an ambitious\ntour of Devon and Cornwall.\nThe polo team managed a20% success in five matches and the\nswimmers 100% victory in three.\nWe started off in Exmouth on\nthe Saturday, where our match\nwas the climax of the regular\nSaturday night gala. Exmouth\nwon the polo\u2014an exciting\nmatch, considering that little\ntraining had been done\u2014and\nI.C. trounced them in the swim-ming. The polo match we won\nat Fowey on Monday was an experience few will forget; the\nwater temperature was 45\u00b0F and\nthe time spent in it was forty\nminutes.\nOn Wednesday evening we\nwent to Penzance pool to take\non the County champions and\nwere blood i ly defeated at polo,\nBob Collins being severely\nscratched whilst not unsuccessfully defending himself against\nassail ance. On Friday we travelled to IIfracombe for a polo match.\nThis was the most enjoyable\nmatch of the tour, both teams\nplayed good, clean, fast polo\nand the capacity audience readily showed their appreciation of\nour performance\u2014a pleasing end\nto a memorable tour.\nQUOTES OF THE WEEK\nBob Schroter, Guilds President:\nIt must be nice to be pervert-ed.\nPresident of the Catholic Society:\nNo woman has ever excited\nme.\nCROSS-COUNTRY\nNOTES\nPete Crews\nWednesday 2nd October saw\nthe beginning of the season with\na run for the fresher's round\nHyde Park. The course used was\nactually the one for the Hyde\nPark Relay. Afterwards the\ntraditional tea was had in Garden Hall. Apart from eating, the\nfresher's suffered a formidable\nbarrage of propaganda for the\nclub.\nThe 1s tU.L. Trial was held\non Sat. 5th Oct. at Parliament\nHill Fields. Though the field\nwas obviously not the complete\nU.L. turn out* we did have one\nor two promising results. Dave\nReaves\" ran well above himself\nand come 9th. There was excellent form indeed for the beginning of the season. Chris James\nand Pete Crews were further\nback at 17th and 20th. It was\ngood to see several fresher s fairly well up in the field; Alan\nWalker, Tim Mill ward and\nDave Penfold in particular.\nWhen they have got used to the\nlonger courses, they ought to\nform the basis for a useful club\nteam. It was also good to see\nJim Bernard and Pete Roy back\nin harness, taking it gently, they\nwent round together and finished\n27th and 28th. A word to those whose names\nwe have but whom we have not\nseen yet. The club will always\nwelcome anyone who wants to\ndo a bit of running.

    "content": "2 F EL1X COMMENT\nby F.D. Fuchs\nIt is only by comparison with\nother London colleges and universities that the uniquely i mm at ure, intellectually castrated and\narchaic nature Of the attitudes\nand customs of Imperial College\nstand out clearly. Perhaps this is\nwhy the Executive is always so\ndetermined to preserve our iso-la tion, for instance from N.U.S. The first issue of Felix this\nsession, the first introduction\nmost fresher s will have to I.C. was graced with not one, but\ntwo photos of our president.\nBoth were of almost identical\nposes, identical clothes, background and facial expression.\nThis fatuous waste of space\nshould be compared with University College's guide to fresher s which contained a feature on the\n1963 Campaign on Education\nand many references to U.C.' s participation in affairs outside\nthe four walls of the college bar.\nThe cult of the President\nevidenced by devoting half Felix\nto him is a reflection of the way\nhe is elected. By removing from\nthe presumably unfit body of the\nunion the power of directly electing their president, they are excused the bother of thinking\nabout his actions. Not having\nbeen directly elected he seems to\nhave no direct connection with\ncommon union members, and becomes invested with a kind of\nPapal infallibility. The real\ndanger of this is not so much\nthat the President may do something silly or wrong. It is that in\nthis and many other facets of\ncollege life, students are discouraged from forming maturely\nsceptical attitudes to the \"powers\nthat be\" and from any kind of\noriginal thought.\nCOUNTER\nCOMMENT\nby the Editor\nThe issue of 'N.U.S. is one\nwhich most of the College is\nglad to see closed. To drag it\nback from the depths in which\nit rests so soon after it was condemned is tedious, and to suggest that the Executive was responsible for its condemnation is\nmerely childish.\nIf Felix is to be compared\nwith the newspapers of other col-leg es, then we must also take\ninto account such apparently\ntrivial matters as facilities, staff,\nand support. Felix is recovering\nfrom a move which very nearly\nreduced it to a typewritten sheet;\nat present it is in the hands of\na rejuvenated staff, and the\nfuture is bright; but destructive\ncriticism can do nothing but\nharm; The essential role of a staff in reporting beyond the bar\nhardly requires explaining. That\nhalf Felix was devoted to the\nPresident apart from being gross\ndistortion, has no bearing on the\nway he is elected. At a Union\ndebate three years ago, the\nmotion that the President be\nelected by the Union was soundly defeated. The arguments then\nhave lost none of their power.\nIt seems fit that Council, who\nappreciate the duties and responsibilities of a President rather\nmore clearly than the average\nstudent, should elect him. There\nis thus little danger of the popular hero being swept into power,\nas happens occasionally in the\nconstitute nt colleges. The President actually suffers the same\nhuman and material temptations\nas does the Pope\u2014there is little\nevidence for the infallibility of\neither. To mention anti author it arian scepticism and original\nthought in the same sentence\nimplies a warped sense of val u es; I comment no further.\nDAVI DF\nROST joins the brilliant,\nwitty, irreverent\nObserver writers\u2014\namong them\nMichael Frayn, Paul Jennings, Katharine Whitehorn,\ncartoonist Feiffer\u2014who take nothing for granted\nexcept the intelligence of their readers.\nEVERY OTHER WEEK IN\ns PQ BO\n. . . BUT WHERE\nWERE THE STUDENTS ?\nThe Chairman in his welcoming speech drew attention to the\ninterest shown in the College by\nthe Royal Family. Recently the\nQueen Mother, Prince Philip and\nnow Princess Margaret have\nvisited the College, also the\nQueen is our visitor. He stated\nthat the South Side building \"re-presents a reinterpretation of the\nsocial pattern embodied in an\nOxford and Cambridge College\nor a normal University Hall of\nResidence.\" He then invited\nPrincess Margaret to declare the\nbuilding open.\nMEN OF THE FUTURE\nHer Royal Highness in her\nspeech said how the lucky the\nCollege was to have acquired\nthis site in the West End of\nLondon. She hoped that distinguished people who had lived in\nPrinces Gardens in the past\nwould be replaced by important\nmen of the future. Her Royal\nHighness then declared the\nbuilding open. In reply the\nRector thanked Her Royal\nHighness for coming and also\ndrew attention to the position of\nthe site.\nPrincess Margaret then went\non a tour of the building during\nwhich she met amongst others\nthe Wardens, the Architect, two\nstudents, Hugh Davis and\nHoward Moore in their rooms\nthe University with regular part-and Mr. Mooney. On leaving the\nbuilding Her Royal Highness unveiled a plaque commemorating\nthe occasion.\nSLOVENLY STUDENTS\nThis visit was an important\npart of the College Calendar and\nit is to be regretted that not\nmore students were present in\nthe Common Rooms which Her\nRoyal Highness visited ; whether\nthis was due to lack of knowledge of where Princess Margaret was to visit, the confusion\ncaused by the visit, the weather,\nor apathy it is difficult to tell.\nThose students who turned up\ndid not have the common decency to take, their hands out of\ntheir pockets when Her Royal\nHigness walked past them\u2014as\nwas obvious by a photograph in\na well-kown National newspaper.\nIn retrospect, was this visit\nworth the \u00a34,000 spent on it ?\nN.J. W. SOCIOLOGIST AT I.C. Professor A.H. Halsey, eminent sociologist and broadcaster,\nis Head of the Department of\nSocial and Administrative Studies at the University of Oxford.\nHis series of five General Studies\nlectures called \"The Social\nStructure of Contemporary\nBritain\" started yesterday with\na talk on the nature of industrial\nsociety. Future topics will include Education, Social Change,\nand the Family in Britain.\nP.A. Riding\n\n"

    "content": "LIX9 FRESHER S LURED Once again that thoroughly predictable performance, fresher s day,\nhas passed us by. This year, however, there were a few entertaining\nnovelties : for instance a bearded exhibition by the caving club\nshowing how, armed to the teeth and carrying all but a parachute\nit is possible to reach Mooney's top eating house without using any\nof the facilities provided, and in addition a real glider assembled in\nthe quad looking for all the world as if it were used to this sort\nof thing. These things apart, the search for genuine talent, enthusiasm\nor subscriptions was evident on a grand scale. The last of the three\nis the only one which will not find its way unerringly to the ap-pr opiate stand, it has to be guided and coaxed by notices which you\nhave to stand on your head to read or can't, read at all ; such is\nmodern advertising. The Guilds Union, in fact, went so far as to\ndisplay their top men seated in a row with above each a photograph of his head which was\u2014perhaps an optical illusion\u2014a little\nART CLASSES1\nHave you ever tried nude\npainting or sketching? If you\nwould like to, come to the classes now being held every Wednesday evening in the Royal College of Art, behind the Huxley\nBuilding. This opportunity is\nunique; the tuition is by Connie\nFenn, a former R.C.A. Scholar\nand all the materials are pr ovid ed. It does not matter in the^\nleast if you have never touched\na brush before; the majority of\nstudents who attend these classes\nare beginners, though there are\na sufficient number of experienced painters to show what can be\ndone.\nIn the summer term we hold\nan exhibition of the best of the\nyears work. The major part of\nthe cost is born by Touchstone,\nbut there is a charge of half-a crown a session. The first class\nis at 6.45 p.m. on Wednesday\n9th October: ask the R.C.A. porter for the actual studio.\nUnfortunately the Royal College of Art is security-conscious,\nand I have to hand in a list of\nnames of people who might be\ncoming, so if there is any chance\nof your coming at all, either put\nyour name on one of the Art\nClass posters or write to, or\nring, Martin Clark, P.G.

Wells Society last Monday. Professor Catlin, whose many distinctions included personal friendship with\nWells, spoke at some length on\nthe patron of that society. At the\nend of it all your correspondent\nfelt that although Wells may have\nbeen around in spirit, the focal\npoint of the meeting was Professor Catlin himself. Unquestionably a man of great intellect, he\nquipped, gossiped and derided,\nthrough forty-five minutes of\nfascinating retrospective thought;\nthe great G.B. S.(\" a man in\nbad taste\"), Bertrand Russell\n(\"who sees himself as grandson\nof a great P.M. and spiritual\ngrandson of Voltaire\"), Julian\nHuxley, Jack all received ment-ion. On Wells himself, we heard\nmainly of \"ses amour e uses\"; one\nsaid of him that he was so direct in matters of love that he\ndid not pause to remove his\nbowler hat, another called him\na coarse little man... Ilittle else.\nBut the society remains the H.G. Wells soc. and its excellent\nprogramme should prove, worth\nattending.\nCAUGHT IN PASSING\nISLAMIC SOCIETY:\nThe aims of the Islamic Society are twofold: to fulfil the\nneeds of the two hundred odd\nMuslims studying at EC. and to\nenlighten our non-Muslim bret-heren about our Religion. In\npursuance of the first aim, the\nSociety holds Jumaa prayers\nevery Friday at 1.00 p.m.( Due\nto the present uncertainty regarding the room those interested are requested to refer to the\nIslamic Society notice board on\nthe Concert Hall floor). With regard to the second aim, the\nSociety invites prominent authorities on Islam to give lectures\nand take part in discussions. The\nSociety invites all members of\nI.C. to its functions.\nCONSORT II\nImperial College is to have its\nown nuclear research reactor at\nSilwood Park. The reactor,\nknown as \"Consort II\", has\nbeen specially designed for I.C. by its builders, G.E.C., and the\nNuclear Power Group. Construction starts in August, and\nthe reactor should start work in\nApril next year.\nThe reactor is of the \"swim-ming pool\" type in which water\nacts as the moderator, reflector\nand coolant. There is external\nconcrete shielding, but it can be\nremoved for fuel changing without danger. In fact, safety and\nsimplicity of operation are keynotes of the design. The fuel itself is a uranium-aluminium al-lo y. \"Consort II\" will chiefly be\nused for nuclear engineering research and teaching, but other\nLondon Colleges will be able to\nuse it for experiments.\nPete Cartwright\n-THEN AS NOW\"...a huge assemblage of\nbuildings and schools without\nvisible centre, guiding purpose\nor directive brain... a constituent\nof that still vaster, still more\nconspicuously a cephalic monster,\nthe University of London...\n...The struggle to blend technical equipment with a carefully\ncherished illiteracy, an intact\noafish ness about fundamental\nthings, has been well sustained.\nSouth Kensington will still tell\nyou proudly \"we are not liter-ary\", and exp'.ain almost anxiously that the last thing it\nwants to impart is a liberal\neducation...\nThe Imperial College, I realize in retrospect, was and still is\nin fact not a college, but a sprawl of laboratories and class-rooms... it has no firm idea of\nwhat it is and what it is supposed to do... it has no philosophy...\nno social idea, no rationalized\ngoal, to hold it together.\nI found myself at South Kensington lost and dismayed at the\nmulti dino us in consecutive ness of\neverything.\"\nH.G.

An above average\nexample can be seen on page one\nof the last issue. It would also\nappear that the President and\nrepresentatives of RCM Union\nhave joined the IC Council. The\nmuch talked about University of\nSouth Kensington has moved a step nearer reality. The Fresher's Pull Out and Throw Away\nGuide to IC is best thrown\naway. Colcutt found ten obvious\nmistakes. Even the Albert Memorial is missing. It is generally\nheld that scientists have a narrow outlook, but few would\nguess their world ends at the top\nof Exhibition Road.\nSouth of the Border one cannot help feeling the 'Powers that\nbe' were a little too zealous in\ndisguising the milk machine.\nDid they feel that Her Royal\nHighness would be e mbar assed to see a cow in Kensington or\nis milk drinking considered a vice in high places? The very\nconspicuous H.G. Wells Society\nis more conspicuous than it\nthinks. Mr. Good lad and his followers seem to have forgotten to\ninform the Union of their exist-en ce.

Anyone who read\nthe last issue of Felix might be\nexcused for doubting the intellect of the C&G Union hier-arch y. Inaccuracy, repetition and\nbeer are its tradition as is seen\nin the fairy story.

September,\nnew regulations were circulated\nto Beit and Selkirk Halls. By\nSaturday they were withdrawn,\nand on the Monday following a new sheet appeared. Immediately\nrumour and speculation raced\nthrough the College, and the integrity of many senior officials\ncame under fire.\nAlmost as soon as South Side\nwas inhabited, the College received numerous complaints\nconcerning noise from local\nmews residents.\nOstensibly because of these\ncomplaints the seven wardens\nmet, and compiled a set of \u201esuggestions\" to be given to the Hall\nCommittees when the new academic year began. Unfortunately\ntwo or three of the wardens became over-enthusiastic and assumed that these \"suggestions\"\nwere now law. Hence the rules\nof the 29th. Senior union officials moved\nquickly. By Monday the new\nrules were issued. Further new\nrules will be made by the Hall\nCommittees.\nGORDON LOWE S The td sal Sports Shop\nGOOD DISCOUNTS FOR\nALL IC MEMBERS\n21-23 Brompton Arcade,\nKnlghtsbridge, S.W.3 KEN4494/5/6 IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nCOMMEMORATION BALL at\nCLARIDGES HOTEL\nTHURSDAY, 24th OCTOBER, 1963\nDancing from 9 p.m. until 2.30 a.m. to the music of\nTommy Kinsman and his Orchestra \u2014 \u2014\nTickets are priced at \u00a34 0s.

    "content": "EDITORIAL FELIX THE STUDENT AND HIS POSITION\nAs the years pass and old students are replaced by new, the\nresponsibility for the affairs of the Union passes into fresh hands.\nCouncil and the Executive are replaced annually and inevitably the\ntransition from experience to inexperience takes place over the long\nsummer vacation. This is unfortunate, for it means that the threads\nof the previous body are not easy to pick up after so long a lapse.\nThus a logical and progressive line is difficult to maintain over the\nyears.\nThis system plays into the hands of the College Authorities. In\nthe perpetual struggle for power the Union and the College have not\nalways worked together. Every year it seems, in the absence of\nthe Executive to protect the interests of the students, the College\ntakes another step in what appears to be a steady transfer of responsibility from the Union to the staff. Each year the newly\nelected President must either accept his diminishing power (and\nthat of his Union) as inevitable, or he must take firm stand at the\ntime at which he is most vulnerable.\nThis year we had the sad saga of the Hall Regulations as reported\nelsewhere in this issue. But for firm and prompt action by the\nPresident and Secretary, the occupants of the Halls would have\nfound themselves under a set of rules which had no constitutional\nbasis whatever. Paragraph 19 of the Hall Regulations states that\nno change of regulation may be made without the approval of the\nTall Committee; to introduce new regulations over the summer\nvacation was clearly an attempt to circumnavigate the wishes of\nthe student. The Union must in its own interests familiarize itself\nthoroughly with the various aspects of its constitution. The Hall\nCommittees themselves might do well to study the booklet of re-gul at ions, whereupon they can bargain from a position of strength.\nNow that there are 7 halls it might prove sensible to coordinate\nthe various Hall Committees by forming a central committee; this\nwould ensure that the expansion and growth of all the halls remains uniform.\nDISCIPLINE OR BE DISCIPLINED\nIt may well be argued that the Union is unfit to govern itself\nbecause of its increasing immaturity. If we are to continue administering our own affairs as it is seemly for a University so to\ndo, then we must prove ourselves capable of maintaining discipline.\nThis is especially necessary in the Halls of Residence; the disciplinary officers must perform a positive function and must work from\na position of respect.\nThe past year has shown that it is often those in the positions\nof highest authority that turn up night after night in an advanced\nstate of alcoholic inebriation. To respect these people is impossible,\nand to expect the authorities to believe that they are capable of\nadministering the regulations is ridiculous. THE PEOPLE IN\nTHESE POSTS MUST REMAIN AWARE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AT ALL TIMES. Perhaps a student body with the\nauthority to fine offenders might help improve the image of the\nCollege.\nIn short, only if the Union can prove itself responsible, especially\nwith regard to the Halls of Residence, can it possibly present a case\nfor the retention of its authority.\nFLY WITH UNIVERSITY\nAIR SQUADRON\nFELIX NEWSPAPER\nOF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nCirculation, 1700\nJ.

Well,\nyou're wrong, you see.\nThe Squadron's sole reason for\nexistence is to teach undergraduates, like yourself, perhaps, to\nfly aeroplanes really well. You\nare even paid most handsomely\nfor your trouble, including a tax-free bounty of \u00a335 annually.\nNow some facts; the squadron\nwas formed in 1935 to promote\na serious interest in flying\nthroughout the University. It's primary aim is not to recruit,\nbut to make undergraduates 'air-minded', and it doesn't matter\nwhat degree you are reading for.\nThe Squadron is an R.A.F. V.R. unit but is staffed by regular\nR.A.F. officers and airmen.\nThere is no commitment\nwhatsoever to join the R.A.F. But of course if you do decide\nto join, then you're off to a flying start (literally).\n\"What is there in it for me?\"\nyou may ask. Well, you get an\nannual minimum of forty hours\nflying on Chipmunk aircraft under highly qualified professional\nR.A.F. instructors. You get a fortnight's continuous flying on\nan R.A.F. station during the\nsummer vacation. During your\ntraining you aim to reach basic\n'wings' standard, after which you\nare commissioned as a Pilot Officer. During all your training,\nhowever, you live like an officer\nin an Officers' Mess. That's not\nall, though.\nYou get an admission to the\nmost exclusive Social Club in\nthe University with regular parties and dances in first rate com-p any. Ask anyone who's been\nthere.\n\"This sounds all right\", you\nsay to yourself. \"What's the\ncatch\"? Well, you're expected to\nfly for one week-end a month\nand to attend the Squadron\nHeadquarters in Princes Gardens, just next to the new Halls\nof Residence for lectures on\nThursdays evenings, after which\nthe bar stays open until the last\nmember leaves. You must also\ngo to the annual camp, mentioned above; hardly a catch!\nAbove all, you must be good.\nAbout 250 people compete for\napproximately 25 places each\nyear and there is no room for\na person who just wants cheap\nflying or the excellent pay.\nWhy do we bother to advert-ise?\nWe advertise because we need\nmore really good people, who\nmust incidentally have excellent\neye-sight, and you may just be\nthe person we want. If you feel\nyou are good enough, then we\nwant to see you.\nThe Editor will be pleased to\nsupply application forms on request through the Union rack,\nor you can apply direct to\nUniversity of London\nAir Squadron,\n48 Princes Gardens, S.W.7. Good flying!\nP.S. You don't have to grow a handle-bar moustache but no\nbeards need apply!\nNOTE : Applicants must be\nbetween 14J and 26, with at\nleast two years to go at University.\nLATE NEWS\nA late news sheet will be\nprinted on the Gestetner at the\nlast possible moment (Tuesday\nNight), and distributed free\nwith Felix. There will be a limited number printed, and these\nmust only be taken when you\nhave bought your Felix.\nFELIX SALES\n1500 copies of the Freshers\nissue were printed, and only 50\nremain.

(now\nHMV) to develop the educational uses of the gramophone. In\n1940 he joined the BBC's Gramophone Department and on\nhis retirement in 1953 was Producer of Specialist Talks (Mus-ic).\nThe theme ui his talks will be\nthat music is something to\nthink about, not just to 'feel'. He\nwill illustrate them with music\nfrom all periods except the\nelectronic one; he has promised\nto deal with modern composers,\nparticularly Britten (whom he\nregards as the greatest of all\ncontemporary composers).

    "content": "FELIX7' Ex-Editor Interviews\nCAMERON\nDr. Cameron, Warden of Tizard Hall, studied at both I.C. and\nCambridge, and is now on the Mechanical Engineering staff.\nAt an interview with Felix, he was asked his views on the new\nHalls of Residence.\n\"These halls, unless we make use of them, will be a failure.\nThey are not for use merely as bed and breakfast efforts; they are\nbuilt as separate units\u2014the architecture clearly indicates that. One\nfloor in four is designed for student activities, and if it is not used\nfor this purpose, all that money will be wasted.\n\"These halls are designed for the students of I.C. to lead a better, fuller life. We want to contribute something to this\u2014that\nis my job as far as I see it.\"\n\"I refer you to the comments that you are trying to compete\nwith the Union.\"\n\"Not at all. If the units are small, more people will take an\nactive part.\"\nDr. Cameron then went on to\nsay that since so many students\ntake no part in Union or sporting activities, because of the\norganisation's unwieldy size, the\nonly solution is to start a rival.\n\"Would you be quite happy\nto leave the constituent college\nunions as they are? Don't you\nthink there would be rivalry?\"\n\"There is plenty of room for\nall.\"\n\"So much untapped talent for\nrival societies?\"\n\"Not untapped; not rival\u2014additional. This question assumes\nthat everybody in the three constituent colleges is fully occupied\nin the three Unions. That is not\ntrue. There is a vast number of\npeople who do nothing in the\ncollege. If a student is in a small\nunit, he is automatically brought\ninto the activities. In a unit of\n120 in residence, 240 out, making 360 in all, everybody would\nknow each other over the three\nyears in College. As I see it, if\na man is a member of a Hall, he\nremains a member whether in\nresidence or out. I refuse to concede this as rival to the Union.\nPeople must realise that I.C. cannot go on without being profoundly changed by these Halls.\"\nFelix then asked Dr. Cameron\nwhether he had any plans for\nfuture activities in Hall:\u2014\n\"Heans, but all so nebulous.\nWe are au it e good at running\nparties. The Sherry Party for\nlocal residents was a great success, they were most interested\nin the students. It is interesting\nfor the ordinary student to meet\nand get to know a Managing\nDirector, or Television Producer.\"\nDr. Cameron finished by saying how much regard he held for\nlast year's President and this\nyear's \u2014they were really interested in the proper use of these\nHalls, and had had many discussions together on the matter.\n\"What we really want\", he said,\n\"is to have some positive suggestions as to how best use these\nHalls of Residence.\"\nA.T. Pawlowicz\nBLACKETT RESIGNS\nThe resignation of Professor\nBlackett, head of I.C. Physics\ndepartment, has been accepted\nby the Governing body. The\nGovernors wish to record their\ngreat appreciation of his service\nover the crucial years of expansion of the College. Professor\nBlacket will remain as a Professor of Physics and Pro-Rector\nof the College.\nPOLITICAL FUTURE\nThis new move by Blackett\nadds weight to the speculation\nat present in Fleet Street, that\nhe is a serious contender for a post in Harold Wilson's government\u2014should Labour get in.\nProfessor But'.er has been appointed in his place.\n| *0PEN The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the\nMidland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those\nwho are older and already established. The Midland Bank is interested in YOU \u2014 and all young people like you. You would find a bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of paying bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of\nyour expenditure.\nMidland Bank THE GO-AHEAD BANK FOR GO-AHEAD PEOPLE\n\n"
