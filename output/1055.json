Such was the\ngreeting from the security\nguard as the faithful * fc entered the Centra\nLibrary last week. Since\n9:30 is too early for satire or strong drink, it must\nbe true.

FELIX FRIDAY MAY 3RD1996 NEWS\nNews in brief continued from front page\nemphasised her wish to 'improve\ncommunications' but has yet to\nclarify how she intends to\nachieve this.\nOn education funding Sarah\nasserts that it is 'vitally important\nthat we plan for the future' and\nthat we 'safeguard the future of\nHigher Education'. In a side\nswipe at the current President\nSarah emp has ies the need to\nconsider the financial problems\nof minority category students,\ninstead of 'concentrating simply\non home undergraduates'.\nSpeaking to Felix, Sarah\nsaid, \"I'm not planning a career in\npolitics... but I feel it's time\nImperial got more involved in the\nUnion, and I feel UL U should\nmove beyond Bloomsbury.\"\nSarah believes that her\nsuccess in 'bringing together\nImperial's current and future\nconstituent medical school\nunions' will be of benefit in her\nprospective role as UL U President. But the presidential\nrace has highlighted the rift\nbetween the smaller medical\nschools in London and the larger,\nmore powerful colleges, such\nImperial, Kings College, and\nUniversity College London.\nRepresentatives of medical\nschool student unions are\nincreasingly concerned that they\nare losing influence in the\nrestructuring of UL U. With\nmany of London's medical\nschools being merged in the next\nfew years, student leaders feel\nthat the strong traditions of the\ncolleges will be lost.\nWith Paul Crawford, an\ninfluential member of UL U's Medical Group, as Sarah's only\nopposition, the contest looks set\nto demonstrate the extent of the\nsplit. Caroline Baker, President\nof Charing Cross and\nWestminster Medical School\nStudents' Union, which is one of\nthe major constituents of the\nnew Imperial Medical School,\nhas nominated Mr Crawford.\nIf successful Sarah would\nbecome the first IC student since\nTrevor McDonald to become\nUL U President. It is unclear\nwhether Miss White will follow\nin Mr Phillips shoes to the extent\nof running for NUS President\nnext year, and possibly even\nbecoming a presenter on ITN.\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nBoat club to appeal\nImperial College boat club have\nappealed against Wandsworth\nBorough Council's decision to\nrefuse planning permission for\nrenovation and extension to their\nPutney boat house. The club's original proposal\nwas rejected last November after\nlocal residents, supported by\ntheir MP David Mellor,\ncomplained that the plans would\nheighten disturbance in the area.\nSince the appeal is unlikely\nto be heard by the council until\nNovember, the club have also\nsubmitted a revised plan, taking\nlocal residents' concerns into\naccount.The boat club are hoping\nthat it will be considered early\nthis summer. Peter Mee,\nImperial College's Registrar, said\n\"We think we have met local\nresidents objections as far as we\ncan.\"\nAs part of the appeal\nprocess, Wandsworth Borough\nCouncil have sent the discussion\nof the plans to a Public Inquiry,\nto be heard in November.\nCollege authorities hope to avoid\nthe costly legal fees this would\nentail by submitting the revised\nproposal.\nGhostly Albert Hall\nA series of spooky sightings at\nthe Royal Albert Hall has forced\nthe management to seek help\nfrom a professional ghost invest i gator.\nFrightened staff have been\nreporting paranormal activity for\nseveral years, so Chief Executive\nPatrick Deuchar decided he had\nno choice but to call in Andrew\nGreen, a civil servant and part\ntime ghost buster. Green spent\nMonday night in the basement at\nthe Royal Albert Hall along with\nreporters and film crews from all\nover the world.\nUnfortunately Green did\nnot spot any uninvited apparitions. He complained that he\ncould not walk across the room\nwithout a television camera crew\nfollowing him and that he only\nhad one hour between 3am and\n4am in which he was left alone.\nAs Felix went to press Green was\nrevisiting the Hall for another\nattempt.\nMed staff under threat\nCutting the number of medical\nschool academic staff is one\noption being considered by the\nvice-chancellor's medical committee last week in order to meet\nGovernment cuts in funding.\nRising numbers of medical\nstudents mean that more staff\nwill be needed to teach them,\nbut the amount of money that\nthe Government has assigned\nmedical schools over the next\nfew years means that the extra\nstaff cannot be recruited. This\nhas raised fears of a decline in the\nstandard of teaching and a subsequently blight of bad doctors.\nSir Michael Thompson,\nchair of the committee, said that\nacademic training had already\nabsorbed a28% cut in funding,\nyet the Government wanted\nmore doctors trained to meet a shortage in the National Health\nService.\nStudent debt rises\nThe level of debt that the average\ngraduate carries with them when\nthey leave university has leaped\nto \u00a33,000, according to a survey\nby Barclays Bank. This is a31% increase over last year's average.\nThe survey found that more than\nthree-quarters of last year's grad rua tes were in debt to the\nStudent Loans Company, banks,\nparents and credit cards.\nInterestingly, graduates who\nfound full-time employment in\ntheir chosen careers had larger\ndebts than those graduates still\nunemployed, mainly due to large\npurchases such as a car or\nclothes. Also, it was found that\nmen, with an average debt of\n\u00a33,476, had a larger debt than\nwomen who had an average of\n\u00a32,414.\nThe findings are in line with\nGovernment's policy of transferring the living costs of students\nonto the students themselves.\n\n"

Fuel rods and\ngraphite blocks were spat out of the\ncore and a plume of radioactive dust began to\nform over the devastated site. The force of\nthe blast shunted the reactor base down four\nmeters. Hot nuclear fuel combined with the\nsand released from the reactors en casement to form a molten lava that burrowed its way\nthrough the floors below.\nImmediate effort was channelled into extinguishing the inferno and to determine whether a fatal self-sustaining chain reaction might occur.\nSite workers hastily made sand bags to add to\npilots' bombing artillery oi boron and lead in\nwhat was to be a futile attempt to quell the\nflames. Fireman fought the flames heroically -wearing standard uniform, their boots melted in\nthe intense heat while their bodies became\ninfected with 'Chernobyl AIDS'. Engineers at\nthe Chernobyl site continued unabated in the\nconstruction of reactors 5 and 6, while the children of Prypiat just 3km away played on.\nWhile the battle against the blast raged,\nanother desperate fight commenced. This time\nthe rules on engagement were not the containment of radiation but the concealment of information. What shocked the world most was the\ncomplacency of the people involved. A tight veil\nof secrecy was hand-crafted by Soviet officials in\nan attempt to shield the world, including\nPresident Gorbachev, from the horrors that had\noccurred. Incredibly, it was almost 3 days later,\n1,000 miles north of Chernobyl, that details of\na nuclear incident became apparent. A worker\nclocking-off at Fosmark Nuclear Power Station\nin Sweden sparked initial concerns when his\nclothes registered higher than normal radiation\nreadings. Senior operators immediately feared a leak at their plant. But before a discharge was\nlocated, Swedish meteorological centres identified airborne radioactive particles. Three\nGovernment agencies in Moscow denied allegations of a disaster. Only that evening did the\nRussian news agency, Tass release a brief statement confirming an 'accident' had indeed\noccurred.\nAfter the accident, over 500,000 people\nassisted in an 8 month clean-up and entombing\noperation.

So now Londoners have their third opportunity to see the stage version. After starting out\non the fringe, they had a short stay in the\nAmbassadors in the West End followed\nby a country-wide tour, and have now settled in the Whitehall theatre.\nOur guide to Edinburgh low life is Renton,\nwho introduces us to his associates and\nhaunts. It is the script rather than the minimalist black set, which describes the\nsqualor. There is virtually no plot, just a stream of loosely connected reminiscences which are disgusting and offensive,\nbut somehow very funny. The small cast\nof four leads to some identification problems, but does include the entertaining\ndouble of the psychopath Begbie also playing\nRenton's mother.\nIf you enjoyed the film, you'll love this, but\nbe quick: it closes on May 11th. \u2022play- the prince's play^a \u2122\nIn 1832 the premiere of Victor Hugo's 'The\nPrince's Play' ('Le Roi s 'amuse') caused the\nFrench King Louis-Philippe so much concern\nwith its portrayal of the Prince as an underhanded scoundrel, that the opening night was also the\nlast night of the run. In the 1990's, we may\nexpect no such reaction to Tony Harrison's English adaptation. Many today would no longer\neven agree with the Victorian modes of thought\nso integral to the plot.\nThe fact that the script is in verse, while not\noverly apparent, serves to enhance the (correct)\nimpression that the play was written a century\nand a half ago, and it is perhaps more interesting\nas a historical piece than it is enjoyable as a production in its own right. (Unless you happen to\nlike that kind of thing - and a fine upstanding citizen you would be too, I hasten to add.)\nGood performances from Ken Stott (as the\ncentral character the Prince's Jester), and Arlene\nCockburn (as the Jester's Daughter), among\nothers, provide an evening of fine drama.\nHowever, one feels that many of the Play's most\nintense moments are held for too long; while\nVictor Hugo possessed many undoubted talents,\nperhaps we may accuse him of not knowing\nwhen to shut up.\nThe sets are very impressive, and maintain\nthe excellent standard which we have come to\nexpect from the Royal National. In particular,\nmuch of the stage is water for some scenes, and\nit really rains on stage, replete with thunder and\nlightning. This is not a play for all tastes, but\nunder Richard Eyre's direction it is well staged\nand well per foi r ned. play - the complete works\nof william shakespeare\n(abridged) ad i Time Out says \"It just ain't fun any more\" but quite\nfrankly they've lost their\nsense of humour.\nAdmittedly, the idea is\nnine years old, and back in\nLondon after a tour round\nthe country, but the\nReduced Shakespeare\nCompany are doing an\nadmirable job of making\ntheir adaptation of the\nbard's entire works still\nseem off-the-cuff.\nIt's all over in 97 minutes (so we're told) and in\nthat time the cast of three\nget through all 37 plays -and that includes Coriolanus as a cookery programme and Othello as a rap. It's a complete\npiss-take, but a very clever one: perhaps the most\nmemorable bit is when they get through all the\nhistories as an American football game. And they\ndon't just spend the entire second half on\nHamlet, but we get an extra-concise three\nminute version, and then 'just one last time', only\nbackwards.\nAny complaints you could\nhave with the performance would only imply\nthat you were taking it all\ntoo seriously. It is certainly\nvery silly, and with the\ngreat tradition of audience\nparticipation is more of a pantomime than a play,\nbut the humour is refreshingly innocent and fast-paced.\nOn Tuesday nights the trio\ntake a break from toying\nwith English literature in\norder to perform The\nComplete History of\nAmerica (abridged) in a mere 90 minutes. It's not quite as funny, and not quite as tight, but hey,\nthese things are all relative.\n\n"

As Cole is swatted\nback and forth through time, he becomes more\ncertain of the involvement of the Army of the\n12 Monkeys, even as his own grasp on reality\nstarts to decay.\nFor his doomsday prophecies, Cole is diagnosed as a delusional psychotic and placed in an\nasylum under the treatment of psychiatrist\nMadeleine Stowe. In the asylum he also meets\nJeffrey Goines, an inmate whose father happens\nto be a famous virologist...\nBmce Willis is surprisingly good and succeeds in creating the necessary madman-or-prophet uncertainty. Pitt gleefully over-acts, his\nexaggerated nervous twitches possibly indicating\nsomething more amiss than just a psychological\nillness. Stowe is elegant as the disbelieve r who is\ndragged into Cole's 'delusions'.\nThe plot is weU-constructed, sidestepping\nthe possible traps of time paradoxes - Cole's overseers know they won't be able to change\nwhat has already happened, but they want a sample of the pure vim s in order to find a cure.\n12 Monkeys is undoubtedly the easiest of\nTerry Gilliam's films to watch but as he was just\nthe hired hand, his vision was only secondary.\nfilm: broken arrow,magpie\nWhile on a stealth bomber training flight, Vic\nDeakins (John Travolta) steals a couple of\nnuclear bombs, and ejects his copilot Riley Hale\n(Christian Slater) from the plane. Why? He has\nbeen passed over for promotion once too often,\nand wants to gets his own back and make some\nmoney by holding the government to ransom.\nHale predictably decides that it's his duty to\nstop Deakins, and drags an innocent park ranger\n(played by Samantha Mathis) along with him.\nThe two of them set off across the Utah out-back, implausibly dodging bullets, helicopter\nblades, trucks and an underground nuclear\nexplosion on the way.\nThe action set-pieces are really spectacular,\nand director John Woo does everything right,\nbut he's let down by a truly appalling script, with\nfar too many awful clich es. Good takings at the American box office\nhave ensured that Travolta will escape unscathed\nby this pretty poor film, but his character is so\nover the top that he's no longer amusing. The\nfilm has little to commend it apart from the\naction sequences, and the Malteser-melting\nSlater. In a similar vein, Mathis is only there for\nthe delectation of the blok es. Broken Arrow is a wannabe Speed, but fails\nin suspense and script despite being written by\nSpeed's writer Graham Yost. It's a mindless\naction film and as long as you don't expect anything more it's passable.\n. , | '\n5J% MY LIfk= STORY\ni Pole Joust ox^^\nTONIGHT\n\"\"'If ^Cross\nWater ^\nAvailable torn ICU and C&G Offi\n\n"

And it must be\na sizeable amount of money if\nthe rent is going to be \u00a360k, and\neveryone is still interested in it.\nSo College gets us a great\ndeal, it gets \u00a360k rent a year, we\nget a posh bookshop with no\nguarantee of better service, we\nlose another Union service and\nall the money it generates and\nthe services the Union could\nprovide with the money.\nBrilliant. Why doesn't College go\nthe whole way, get rid of the\nnon paying students, and sell off\nall its facilities to the highest bid-der?\nI'd say don't let this happen,\nbut I don't suppose my opinion\nas a mere student matters, does\nit?\n/.

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 3RD MAY 1 9 9 5 . FIVE\nIn the tradition of suicide notes the world over,\nby the time you read this article I shall be somewhere far away. Goodbye cruel world...\nWell not quite. I may be heading to a dark\nand foreboding place, but on closer inspection\nthat turns out to be Sunderland, not Hades. Not\nan obvious distinction, I might add, but a crucial\none. Are you sitting comfortably? Then we can\nbegin...\n(Swirly special flashback-type effects...)\nWhen I decided to start my degree in\nAeronautical Engineering - I 'll admit it - I was\ndrunk. There were a few places left on the old\nUCAS form, so I thought: \"Why not? I always\nwanted to be a spaceman.\" Thus a fabulous\ncareer was to be born. So why now, six\nmonths down the winding track that is\nthis country's educational system, am I writing an article on getting out?\nThe answer is that I have done. Read\nthat again and you'll get it. Due to various\nfactors I came to the decision that being\nan Aeronautical Engineer was just not for\nme. The first person I contacted was an\nold friend who'd been through a similar\nexperience whilst reading Applied Physics\nat Durham. We chatted for quite a while,\nand I was given confidence that I was not H front, I had some great friendships developing,\nthings was going well with the newspaper and\nmy radio show was gaining notoriety, if not pop-u lari ty: why worry about my p oxy little course?\nThat would sort itself out, surely. Pass the Stoli,\nthank you very much.\nOf course, when you're doing the most\nexacting degree in Europe, things are fairly\nunlikely to sort themselves out.\nThis realised, I leapt into panic mode,\nworking unheard of hours to try and get back on\ntarget. Throwing myself into the maelstrom that\nis an Aero student's Easter break, I rapidly had\nmy worst fears confirmed, that I was a) unable\nand b) unwilling to complete the course.\nalone. The testosterone dominated atmosphere\nof the College encourages few to divulge their\nshortcomings, especially those who've had it\nacademically easy in the past. A big step is\nacknowledging that you've made a mistake,\nwhether that be in your original choice of course\nor the amount of work you've put into it.\nMine was a hybrid case; it's challenging to\ntake on a demanding course that interests you,\nlikewise, a tiresome subject can be made palatable by it being simple to succeed in. However,\nwhen you manage to find yourself on a course as\nimpossibly difficult as it is mind numbing ly tedious, you should realise you've got problems.\nDuring the Spring Term the merest consideration of leaving College hadn't had the temerity to think about crossing my mind. Things\nseemed to be promising on the relationships\nHaving recovered from the resultant bacchanalian blow-out that such realisation s often\npre-em pt,I looked to my parents for guidance,\nand like the best of counsellors, they merely\nbrought out to the fore what I'd been thinking\nall along; to start thinking along the lines of\ndoing something else.\nBut what?\n\"So, what, a day job? Not in this life\" was\nthe first thing to traipse merrily into my consciousness from the pen of Tarantino. But as I thought about it, what else is there to do?\nIt is notoriously difficult to take advantage\nof one's parents properly if you're hanging\naround the house all day. And the only other\nway for educated teenagers to make money is by\ndealing. After only a few moments hesitation, I reluctantly opened the weekend's pile of newspapers and started the joyous task of 'job hunt-ing' as I believe it is popularly called.\nSeveral hours of the nicest possible telephone voice in recent history later, threatening\nmuch violence to my brother's antiquated\nAmiga and its equally ancient printer work mate, several copies of my appropriately san it is edC V were winging their wicked way to unsuspecting\ncompanies across the region.\n\"Yes of course I have extensive clerical\nexperience,\" I was heard to claim. \"Well motivated? Oh yes, absolutely. Reliable?\nEnthusiastic? That goes without saying, sir,\" I grovelled, realising for the first time how much\narse-licking really goes on in the strange world of\nignoring people of education, ambition,\n*$ intelligence and original thought for those\nwith a sad devotion to those holding the\npay packets, a world which lauds obscurity\nand mediocrity as virtuous, a world that we\nr is i bly call real life.\nYes, that's right, I haven't got a job yet.\nUpon my return to London the week\nbefore the start of what was to be my final\nterm, one quick chat with my Senior Tutor\nand it was all over, quite literally in min-ute s. It was ironic that after all the\nupheavals and heartache of getting to\nImperial in the first place, never mind the sleepless nights debating the issue of quitting, that\nthe act itself was so transitory. Not so much as a form to sign. Walking out into the April sunshine\nI was left feeling quite, quite lost. I'd talked it\nthrough until I was, if not blue, then a pretty off-purple in the face. \"I'm sure I'm doing the right\nthing\" I heard my self saying to those I had\nsounded out.\nTalking it over is one thing. Grasping the\nreality once the talking has been done is quite\nanother.\nI would like to apologise for getting all serious at the end of this article, and also to thank all\nthose who have made my time here so enjoyable.\nYou know who you are.\nJonathan Trout.\nDon't Panics Don't bottle it up; tell people\nu u hot's on your mind os soon as\npossible. Talk to your friends,\nfamily, counsellors, pastoral staff\n- it doesn't need to be formal,\nand talking about the problem\noften gets it into perspective.\nFind out your position a ii th your\nL \u20acR; you may need to pay back\nsome of your grant, or they may\nbe nasty to you and not give\nyou any money ever again.\nLiketuise, look into your accommodation agreements. Vou may\nbe liable for forfeit payments if\nyou don't approach it carefully.\nTake plenty of time and advice\nto decide your future, as rushing\nfrom one ill suited course into\nanother would be disheartening\nto say the least.\nDon't worry about finding something else to do. The very fact\nthat you got into Imperial shou us that you are more than capable\nof getting on a course or career\nof your choosing.\nMake sure you get a bloody\ngood send off.\n\n"

    "content": "album: the cranberries - -to the faithful departed aro line Finally, a few years and a few million years later,\nThe Cranberries are releasing their third album.\nAs expected, the songs rely\nheavily on the unique voice of\nDolores, which may or may\nnot be a good thing depending\non your point of view. Her\nvoice is backed up ably by the\ninstruments and an increasingly strong percussion section,\nculminating in the almost military tattoo beating through\n'Bosnia'.\nThis leads on to the fact\nthat this album is used as a vehicle for various messages: anti-war in 'War\nChild' and 'Bosnia', and touching on suicide and\nsexual harassment in 'Free To Decide'. If some of\nthe profits go towards helping people in these situations I 'll be more convinced...\nNonetheless, the album has some good songs\nin the classic Cranberries style, in 'The Rebels',\nI'm Still Remembering', and of course the first\nsingle, 'Salvation', which should keep the fans\ngoing until the tour in\nDecember. They have also\ntested a few new ideas such\nVj as a Taize-esque chant in\n'Electric Blue', and the rather\nDoors-ish organ solo in 'Free\nTo Decide'. Unfortunately, in\na couple of songs they go\noverboard, with the music in\n'Joe' and the drums in\n'Bosnia' overwhelming the\nI voice, destroying the balance\nwhich characterises much of\ntheir other work.\nUltimately, however, this album will be well\nreceived by their current fans and will probably\ngain them not a paltry few more.(7) gig: the auteurS n \"Cheers,\" utters Luke Haines, the king of introspection and pen master of scary lyrics . Is that all\nhe has to say? \"Cheers\", I ask you. What next?\nThe Auteurs recording an AOR record? No\nchance. Luke realises his mistake and satisfies the\ncrowd with some abuse.\nAs you can tell, this is no normal gig. After all,\nThe Auteurs are a band who are not really accessible to the kids and so there are no spotty mosh-ers here (apart from two crazy French girls). To\nsay that they are an acquired taste is an under-statement. Described by one journalist as the type\nof band \"who sound like die y were good at maths\nat school\" they play music that is in your face,\nwith the inspiration for their songs coming from\nmissing children to child brides.\nUnsurprisingly, the gig has a unique atmosphere. The new album has been out for just four\ndays and everybody knows the words. There is an\nintensity about the crowd that is mirrored in the\nband who need to concentrate because the 'tunes'\nare hard to play. The crowd sways in near silence\nas the band start the set with the tide track from\nthe new album After Murder Park'. It is then that\nLuke utters his \"Cheers\".\nThe energy of the band builds through the\ngig.

FELIX FRIDAY MAY 3RD1996 SPORT\nFELIX SPORT\nCosmopolitan\nTeam Go Down\nAt the end of April, a team of six\nwent to France to take part, for\nthe second time, in the Edhec\nInternational Yachting Regatta\nheld in La Rochelle.\nRepresenting Imperial's cosmopolitan image the crew was\nmade up of Irish skipper (Mark),\nthree Frenchmen (Charly,\nFrancois and Eric), two Germans\n(Lutz and Eric again) and a Norwegian (Bjorn).\nTension built up during the\nSunday training, in spite of the\nexcellent wind conditions,\nrevealing how difficult it was for\nthe team to adjust with so little\ntraining.\nThe general outcome of the\nweek confirmed that nervousness was justified. Even though,\nthey finished 5th out of the 12\nWhirlpool boats on Monday,\ntheir luck ran out on Tuesday\nwhen an early start disqualified\nthem. Unfortunately, the English\nboat edged over the starting line\nbefore the signal. But the sun\nhelped them to stay in good s pir its.\nIn spite of strong hopes for\nthe next regattas, they finished\n11 th on the Wednesday night\nevent. The six came back\nfatigued at three o 'clock in the\nmorning, their faces betraying\nbitterness after twelve hours at\nsea. Their fate was no better than\n8th on Thursday, and they\nbrought up the rear on Friday.\nFinally, they shattered all expectations by coming second, on the\nlast regatta, on Saturday. Better\nlate than never!\nThird\nClass\nA rollercoaster Hockey season\nwhich began in ignominy was\nrounded off in grand style by a cup run and victory over Royal\nHolloway.\nThe thirds began life as a disjointed throng who showed\nlittle promise of the glories yet\nto come. After shedding a little\nballast, the post-Christmas period surely counts as one of the\nmost prolific in the teams his to ry.\nAlthough our Wednesday\nleague performances were somewhat lacklustre and Saturday\ngames yielded only average\nresults, the infamous and elusive\nteam spirit was in full force and\nthreatened to blind teams who\ndidn't wear sunglasses!\nBut the real jewel in the\n'Ken Army' crown lay in the\nBUSA Cup matches. A powered\nup team braved the rig ours of\nRH UL and UCL where we did\nourselves proud to play the game\nof the season and win 3 - 1.\nAlthough the steam train\nwas eventually derailed by the\nsuperb Brunei UL, the previous\nresults made us the 'prodigal\nsons' of the club as a whole.\nA fluke light failure in the\nlast game may mean we avoid\nrelegation... but does it matter?\nIn a season of missed trains,\nboat races and lost minibuses the\ngame becomes perhaps secondary to the laughs we've had\nas a team. KEN ARMY!!!\nChess club reach quarter finals\nThis year IC chess club\nentered a team in the national\nhandicap rapid play knockout\ncompetition. Each player plays\nthe same opponent twice and the\ntime limit is half an hour for each\nplayer for all moves. We did reasonably well, knocking out a6.5/8 or as little as 2/8 to go\nstrong side from Barbican in through to the next round. Our\nround 3, but in the quarter-finals team (usually) consisted of Matt\nwe were knocked out by Piper, Dom Goodwin, Jeremy\nMaidstone, who won last year. Davies and Dave Tang.\nThe handicap system meant that Hopefully we can do better\na team may require as much as next year.\nImperial\nCyclists\nCome\nNinth\nOnce again Imperial were the\nonly London College to field a complete team for the national\nstudent championships and\n(with some carbon fibre assis-t ance) they put in a good performance. Lacking injury-hit Nick\nOsborne, the team of Liam\nMaybank, Duncan Emery and\nAgis Agisilaou competed against\nnational squad and commonwealth games riders to achieve a highly creditable 9th in the team\ncompetition.\nBest individual performance\nwas Liam with a rapid 22 minutes 29 seconds (averaging\n26.7mph) for the distance,\nDuncan came home with 23\nminutes 30 seconds (25.5mph) and Agis, in his first British time\ntrial, recorded 24 minutes\n43seconds(24.2 mph) The overall winner in the individual competition was Michael\nHutchinson (Cambridge) with\n20 minutes 49 seconds (a rapid\n28.8mph)( obviously he has no\nwork to do). Next up is the\nnational 25 mile time trial in two\nweeks. A big thankyou goes out\nto the Harlington Trust for paying for the aerodynamic aid.\nSportsNews\nManchester United are strong\nfavourites to lift the Premiership title\nafter beating Forest 5 - 0 last weekend.\nNewcastle must now make up six goals in\ntheir remaining two matches if they are to\nbe crowned champions.\nFrom Division One Sunderland\n(Champions) and Derby are both to play\nPremiership football next season.

FELIX FRIDAY MAY 3RD1996 NEWS\nNew degree ceremony low key'\nICU spend \u00a31800 to cancel Commemoration Ball\nBY DAVID COHEN\nA new slimmer Commemoration\nDay experience was unleashed\nlast Wednesday on Imperial\nCollege. The increasing postgraduate pop rd ation, currently\namounting to over a third ol the\nstudent numbers, has forced\nCollege to spilt the occasion\ncommemorating the departure of\nImperial College students.\nThis week saw the first of\ntwo commemoration days after\nthe decision to split the event\ninto ceremonies in May and\nOctober was taken last year. In\nprevious years, when there was\nonly one graduation event, the\nceremony usually lasted over\nthree and a half hours. In a change from the traditional\nperformance of the choir at the\nOctober event, this year's musical interlude was provided by the\nImperial College clarinet player\nJames Marchese.\nLast Wednesday also marked\nthe inauguration of a new Fellow\nof the College, Lewis Warpole.\nFamous for his radio and television appearances, he has for\nseveral years been actively\ninvolved in an effort to explain\nscience to the general public.\nWarpole encouraged the audience of new graduates to exercise\na degree of humility when\nconsidering the impact of scientific and technological progress\non \u2022 society. This sentiment was\nlater reinforced by the Chairman\nof the Governing Body, Sir Frank\nCooper. The ceremony was\ncompleted in under two hours.\nThe day's proceedings came\nto an early end as the evening's entertainment, the Commemoration Ball, had to be cancelled\ndue to lack of interest. With only\nforty tickets sold the cancellation\nhas cost Imperial College Union,\nthe event's organisers, \u00a31,800 but\nthis was calculated as being less\nthan what would have been lost if\nthe ball went ahead.\nNegotiations are under way\nto gain compensation from\nCollege's Registry Department to\ncover the cancellation fee. With\ninvitations allegedly being sent\nout three weeks after the planned\ndate, ICU claim that the graduates did not have enough time to\nrespond. Others have suggested\nthat there was simply not enough\ninterest from postgraduates in\nhaving a ball in the first place. PHOTO: WILLIAM LORENZ\nPaxman: A very nice blok e' continued from page am'.\noutside rival team hotel rooms in\nan attempt to intimidate them.\nJeremy Paxman, the University Challenge question master\nand formidable anchorman of\nBBC 2's political review, Newsnight, did not pose any problems\nfor the team. Chris says that he\nwas a 'very good, very nice blok e', and that after the final he joined\nthem in the celebratory drinking.\nMark, 34, felt that he was less\nintimated by Paxman because he\nwas older.'We took the piss out\nof him,' he said.\nSpeaking to Felix earlier this\nweek, the team were relaxed\nabout their imminent fame. All team members denied that\nwinning the final would change\ntheir lives in any way. Mark\ncommented that University\nChallenge success didn't predict\n'how good drinkers or how good\nlovers' they were, but 'merely\nshowed that we can win quiz\nprogrammes.'\nExcitement was added to the\nfinal rounds as the competition\nwas held two days before the\ncaptain's wife was due to give\nbirth to their first child.\nConcerned that she might\ndistract the team if she went into\nlabour during filming, she\ndecided to stay at home for the\ncrucial matches. This anxiety\neventually turned out to be\nunnecessary, as Mark's child was\nfinally born five days after the\nfilming finished.\nThe glory is not merely\nlimited to a half hour slot on\nBBC2 as the team has also made\nappearances on The Big\nBreakfast, Greater London Radio\n(GLR), The Evening Standard,\nand are booked for an IC\nReporter interview, or PRAVDA as Jim describes the college\npaper. Mark emphasises that\nwinning has not changed the\nteam: 'We were always this bad',\nhe insists.\nFestivities following the final\nwere helped along by plenty of\nfree beer provided by Granada,\nthe show's producers. Karaoke\nsinging to 'We are the champions'\nwas not especially diplomatic,\nbut repeating the line 'No time\nfor losers' did not apparently go\ndown too well with the inebriated opposing teams.\nThe team summed up their\nexperience as 'stressful' emphasising how different it is answering the questions in the studio as\nopposed to relaxing at home.\nTheir total score of f495 over\nfive rounds was one of the highest ever seen in the tournament,\nor as Mark puts it: 'Two standard\ndeviations away from anyone\nelse.\"\n\n"

Their debut album was a wrecking-ball\nof aggression driven by Tom\nMorello's incredible array of\nguitar sounds and Zack de la\nRocha's indignant rap vocals,\nwhile 'Killing In The Name'\nbecame every rock-club goer's stomp anthem. Perhaps in view\nof having a lot to live up to, it\nhas taken them three years to\nrelease the follow-up, although\napparently it only took them\nabout three weeks to actually\nrecord it. The trouble is that in\nsome places it shows...\n'People Of The Sun' and\nrecent single 'Bulls On Parade'\nopen things in fine style and\nshowcase the new Rage sound - one that still\nhinges around Morello's guitars and de la Rocha's anarchistic stance, but which is now less riff y and\nmore percussive. The latter song, in particular, is\nwhere they get it just right, where the emotional\npressure is allowed to slowly rise until the seal\nbreaks and the song explodes into one of those\ncataclysmic finales that this band are so good at\ndelivering.\nThe problem is that from here\non it all gets, well, a little pre-dic table. From 'Vietnow'\nthrough 'Revolver' and on to\n'Year Of Tha Boomerang' it's the same formula and one that\nhardly needs repeating.\nAlthough there aren't any bad\nsongs there is a conspicuous\nabsence of memorable\nmoments resulting in a homogeneous mass of sli ghd y tedious\naural anger.\nAlthough I'm sure that the\nenergy of their forthcoming live\nshows will more than compensate for the quality ot the songs,\nI can't help feeling that they're going to have do\nsomething new and a bit quicker than it took\nthem to do this. (6)\n-gig: ruby+red snapper EA The recently refurbished, 'ultimate' concert\nvenue of UL U was sold out weeks in advance and\nwas packed with people eager to see Ruby's first\ngig in London. The DJ, Dean Thatcher, did an\nexcellent job of warming up the crowd with a selection of jungle anthems and house tracks, and\nRuby came on to a warm\nreception.\nRuby's excellent album,\n'Salt Peter', was a landmark\nin the ever-expanding landscape that is trip-hop. It was\nessentially the work of\nLesley Rankine together\nwith a bunch of producers\nand programmers. In other\nwords, it was very much a studio album and so it was\nalways going to be difficult\nto translate the songs to a live environment without\nsimply singing along to taped\nbacking tracks, a route was\nthankfully avoided.\nThe band played well\nenough. The familiar samples were present and correct and the songs were\nthere, but I failed to be moved by the whole experience. Lesley was obviously keen to emphasise\nthat she is no longer the boot-stomping 'g rrr l' that\nfronted Silverfish, but the one thing missing was\nthe anger and the sheer intensity that makes\nRuby's recorded output so moving. Tonight they\nsounded like any average rock band, only occasionally rising above mediocrity such as on the\ncurrent single, Tiny Meat', which far surpassed\nthe recorded version.\nPerhaps the poor showing was due to nerves.\nAfter all, this is their first gig in the capital,\nalthough they have been playing in Europe since\nthe New Year. I only hope that they develop\nenough to do justice to the excellent material they\nhave.\nRed Snapper, however, were a different kettle of fish Q). After more\nclassy tunes from the DJ,\nthey came on and hit an\ninfectious groove immediately. For those of you\nunacquainted with their\nwork, it is best described as\n'future jazz'. 'Reeled &\nSkinned', their album, is a fantastic voyage through\njazz licks coupled with\ndub by, chilled out, trip-hop py beats, and that\nessential groove. They are\neven better live!\nThe rhythm section was\ntight, with the double bass\ndelivering that extra\ndimension. The saxophonist played with great feel,\nespecially on their hit single\n'Hot Flush', which had the\ncrowd in raptures. The whole band gelled brilliantly and even my companion enjoyed it, in spite\nof her general aversion to 'dance' music.\nPerhaps Red Snapper shone more as a result\nof Ruby's lacklustre performance, but never the less, this band is destined for greatness. Their\nremixes of Ruby's album and of Garbage's last\nsingle will only enhance their reputation, one\nwhich they thoroughly deserve.\n\n"

Ian and Jeremy\nwere skippering two 36 foot boats with the\nmost international crews they probably ever\nhad. There were British, French, German,\nItalian, Japanese, Norwegian, and Spanish\nfolks.\nThe two vessels, Romeo and Juliet, did\nnot escape the fate of their names and diverted their course from the very first day. The\nadventurous Romeo set off for France while\nJuliet chose to take advantage of the easterly\nwind and go west. As the night came, the fog\nthickened and the wind dropped; just about\nthe worst conditions for sailing. To keep\ngoing we decided to split into two watch\nteams.\nDealing with the lack of wind and visibility was pretty much a matter of staying\nwarm and awake. Meantime, sounding the\nfog horn to make sure other vessels noticed\nus did not precisely match Ian's musical\ntaste. The tiny light hanging around the mast\nkept projecting twisted shadows onto the fog\ncurtain, thus making the scene even more\nsurreal.\nThe lapping of the sea on the hull, the\nlong \"toot\" from passing cargoes and the\nintermittent messages on the VHF radio\nwere our only links to the outside world. As\nthe first watch team went to bed for the\nthird time that night, the wind suddenly\npicked up. We reached Torquay in the morning with some worries about the engine, but\nit did not resist Greg's inspection. We went\nfor a nice meal before setting off again to the\nnearby harbour of Dartmouth.\nThe week passed surprisingly quickly.\nWe managed to reach Salcombe on\nWednesday evening. Back toward the east,\nthe sunny day was as enjoyable as the steady\nwesterly wind that led us to Weymouth, a quiet place really. But Juliet will rather\nremember it for its bakery around a street\ncorner. The next day, on the way to Poole,\nwe nearly lost our cook. He had managed to\nclimb up the mast! And that was not all.\nAfter the radio betrayed Romeo's return,\nJuliet met him up on his balcony at Poole\nharbour. This eventful trip finally ended in\nCowes on Saturday night, where Simon celebrated his birthday in the local pubs.\nWith a bit of tan and a persistent feeling\nof rocking, we came back to Port Solent on\nSunday, already considering the next trip.\nsunday\n5\nmay\nGliding Club\nGliding at Lasham Airfield.

    "content": "NEWS FELIX FRIDAY MAY 3RD1996. THREE\nNUS overturns\nfunding policy\nBY MARK BRIDGE\nThe National Union of Students\nhas dropped its 16 year long\ncommitment to campaign lor the\nreturn of student grants to 1979\nlevels. The policy, decision came\nat Easter's Blackpool conference\nafter a series of concentrated\nefforts by various individuals and\ngroups to bringing about a more\nrealistic NUS education funding\npolicy. The impassioned annual\nconference attracted a record\n1500 delegates, a majority of\nwhom voted in the new policy.\nDuring the preamble to the\nBlackpool conference both the\nScottish and Welsh NUS conferences rejected radical policies\nadvocating 'demonstrations' and\n'occupying buildings to protest'\ntypifying the sea change toward\nless militant positions.\nDouglas Trainer, NUS Scotland President, who\ndefeated Clive Lewis, NUS Vice-President, in the recent\nNUS Presidency contest rallied\nwith Scottish Students Associations in calling for a policy of\n\"realism rather than revolution\".\nLewis advocated a return to full\ngrants and free education,\nhowever Trainer won the battle\nto lead the NUS next year by\n586 votes to 458.\nThe lobbying group New\nSolutions has been credited with\na significant role in bringing\nabout the changes. Coordinated\nby Ghassan Karian, President of\nthe University of London Union,\nthe moderate pressure group was\nborn out of feelings of disquiet\nand malcontent after last year's NUS conference in Derby where\ncalls for policy reform were\npreviously dismissed.\nCountering the old-style\ncalls for free education that have\ncharacterised past NUS conferences Karian insisted that \"the\npolicy is un achievable and will\nnot address the problems we face\n- of student hardship, the fall in\nquality and the need to increase\naccess.\" He marked the occasion\nout as being one of the most\nimportant student conferences\nfor decades.\nHowever, the expedient\nvehicle that was New Solutions is\nnow likely to disintegrate as its\nmembers leave to set up new\nNUS education funding-policy\ndiscussion groups. These will\nargue out the relative merits of\ntop up fees, entrance levies and\nstudent contributions.\nThe decision to no longer\npress the Government to fully\nfund higher education comes in\nthe light of increasingly worrying\nstatistics on the extent of\nstudent hardship.\nA newly released survey has\nindicated that a third of students\nmiss lectures because they have\nto work in order to remain at\nuniversity. The poll of 622\nstudents from a cross section of\ndifferent universities around the\ncountry showed that nearly one\nhalf of those in higher education\nalso have part-time jobs. Of\nthose that work, more than\nthree-quarters said that it has an\nadverse effect on their studying.\nPHOTO: ALEX FEAKES\nDemolition of the final remaining support structures of the old\nRoyal College of Science II chemistry building is due to be\ncompleted today, ahead of schedule. Phil Hilton, Schal Project\nManager, said that the preparations for the construction of\nImperial's new Biomedical Sciences building were 'progressing\nwell'. He also expressed confidence that the contractors would be\nable to make up for time lost when planning permission lor the new\nbuilding was delayed.\nSheet piling will commence early next week as the process of\nunderpinning RCS I begins. In a process expected to take several\nweeks, the contractors will construct a temporary retaining wall to\nhelp ensure that the historic chemistry building, which is part of a recognised conservation area, is not structurally harmed as the foundations for the new building are dug. The next stage of the process,\nexcavating the basement, is due to begin on June 24th. IC Radio victim of 'considerable security flaw'\nBY JONATHAN TROUT\nThe newly reconstructed Southside Disco was broken into last\nWednesday evening. Imperial\nCollege Radio's Jules Taplin and\nRob Clarke discovered the breakin the following afternoon, finding an SL-1210 Technics deck,\nthree head shells and a mixer\nmissing. These items have a combined value of over \u00a31,200.\nIt appears that the intruders\nwere able to walk through an\nunlocked fire door, which was\nprotected by a lockable outer\ndoor before the new Health\nCentre building work. The\nculprits forced the lock on the DJ\nbooth and made off with the\nequipment, missing in their haste\na \u00a3900 CD player.\nKen Weir, Imperial's Chief\nSecurity Officer, stated:\n\"Security cannot at this time\nmake much of a comment,\nexcept that the break-in highlighted a considerable flaw in the\nsecurity of the building.\nTemporary measures have been\ntaken to plug the gap, namely\nextra patrols and locks on the\ndoor in question.\"\nMr Weir also stressed the\nneed for Southside residents to\ncome forward with any information they may have relating to\nthis or any other offence. He\nfurther advises anyone with\nexpensive equipment to have it\nproperly marked.\n\n"
