This will be followed by the\nSociety's AGM at which the elections for next\nyear's committee posts will take place (vote for\nme, folks) and not before time, as this year's President was reduced to a quivering mass of\nprotoplasm at Eastercon and another year\nmight finish him completely.\nYHA\nEaster saw, for ten of us, the highlight (so far)\nof this year's activities, a week's camping in\nGlen Coe. In amongst some of the highest\nmountains in Scotland this must be one of the\nmost majestic settings in Britain.

We left College in great\nspirits and managed to get as far as Hyde Park Corner before the roof rack took a nose\ndive onto the windscreen after a gentle\nemergency stop. Our second driving attempt\nproved more successful and we boarded the\nZecbrugge ferry just two minutes before it\nsailed.\nWe spent a day sightseeing around Nijonegen and Arnhem before the start of the\nrace on Friday night at midnight. Carolyn Walton ran the prestigious first leg to put the\nImpalas in a strong position, improved still\nfurther by T Asteriades in the second leg.\nThe race continued through the night and Q Sailing\nThis is the most important university team\nracing championship held in this country.\nThis year eleven teams from England and one from Delft, in Holland, were invited. The event was held the weekend before Easter at\nElton Sailing Club near Bury in Lancashire.\nOn arriving at the lake even judgement\nclouded by the previous night told that\nracing was near impossible.\nAfter a two hour delay, as a very slight\nripple crossed the water and the race officer\nhad learnt to operate the automatic starting\nsystem (a source of some distress to bc th him and some competitors later in the weekend) it\nwas decided that racing must begin.\nTeam racing tactics were of necessity\nalmost abandoned in the light winds as team\nmembers opted for boat speed in the hope of\nindividual success. Conditions improved slightly for the afternoon but by the evening\nit was clear that Liverpool, Bristol, Cambridge and I Chad the fastest \"light\nweather\" helms and so it seemed likely that\nthe eventual winner would be one of three.\nSunday opened with similar prevailing\nconditions although, superficially IC's chances seemed to be improved by a bst in ance the previous night. However the reverse\neffect was evident and they proceeded to\nthrow away chances of winning the trophy by-losing to people who had previously been\nconsidered \" no hopes\" from the bottom of\nthe league. As Salford filled in their results on\nthe board it became clear that they had been\nwinning race after race (on protest) and since\nI Chad lost to Cambridge they had to beat\nLiverpool, Bristol and Salford to remain in with any chance whatsoever. After dismissing\nBristol almost without a glance over their\nshoulders and Liverpool with little more\ndifficulty the task of beating Salford began\nDespite some excellent team racing and individual sailing, as IC approached the last\nstraight they had a losing combination of\npositions. The flame of hope was rekindled\nhowever as the second place Salford boat in a first magnitude blunder, cuffed and sailed\none of his own boats and anIC boat past the\nmark so allowing one IC boat to pass all three. So what had been clear victory turned\ninto an exciting dash for the line. Unfortunately Salford still won and in so doing\nclinched \" the barrel\". IC continued their\nearlier collapse in their remaining races and finished a disappointing sixth.\nTeam: Ajderian, Chadwick, Curwen, Kennedy,\nWilliams, Tounghusband.\nFELIX, April 30, 1982 Page 7\n\n"

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nNO NONSENSE NORMAN!\nTebbit Defends Government Employment Policy\nAn ugly crowd of over 15 demonstrators gathered in front of\nMech Eng yesterday lunchtime as Norman Tebbit, the\nSecretary of State for Employment, arrived to lecture the\nConservative and Industrial Societies.\nThey were cautioned by Professor P. Grootenhuis,\nPresident of the Conservative Society, that Mr Tebbit was a guest at the College and said that he didn't want any\n\"throwing and nonsense\".\nMr Tebbit arrived 20 minutes late and addressed a crowd of over\n200 people in Me chEng220. He briefly outlined some of the major\nobjectives of the conservative government in the fields of industry and\nemployment. The 'ugly statistic' of 3 million unemployed was, he said,\nalmost inevitable in the face of world recession and he claimed that an\nincrease in productivity together with the limiting of inflation to just\nover 10% should be set against the increase in unemployment.\nAt this point four demonstrators wheeled their bicycles into the\nlecture theatre and Mr Tebbit quipped that he didn't underestimate\nthe mobility of labour.\nHe continued with an explanation of the Youth Opportunity Scheme ( Y OPS) and outlined his reasons for proposing the Youth Training Scheme ( Y TS) which will take effect in September 1983. Mr Tebbit considered that this scheme would provide good training lor\nschool leave rs and would guarantee Hi and 17 year olds a year's employment.\nAfter 15 minutes he stopped talking and invited questions from the\nll o or. A varied and often heated question session followed in which Mr Tebbit answered points ranging from his views on the similarity of the\nconservative government and the Argentinian Junta, to the mobility of\nlabour and the proposed Youth Training Scheme.\nIn answer to a question on the governments Employment Bill he\nbriefly outlined the main points. He said the bill was aimed to limit the\npowers of the trade unions, especially with reference to the closed shop\npolitical strikes (as opposed to industrial) and union only' labour\ncontracts. People would be offered a greater protection, including\nthose sacked due to refusal to join a closed shop.\nThere was a mixed response from the audience to these answers and\nseveral points were made before Mr Tebbit had to leave.

    "content": "Thatcher Must Go!\nby Frank James\nWhat do the Falkland Islands mean to you? If\nyou are a miner then not a great deal I would\nimagine since those who are prepared to work\nin South Africa can have no qualms about\nworking for an authoritarian government which has occupied British territory in the\nprocess subjugating and depriving of human\nrights some 1,800 British citizens. I find it\nutterly appalling that suddenly the majority of\npeople in this country have discovered that\nauthoritarian regimes are nasty\u2014I and people\nlike me have been saying it for years. (In the\ncase of South Africa this is not helped by\npriests using economic arguments that are ten\nyears out of date to justify trading links with\nSouth Africa and thereby implicitly support the\ngovernment there.)\nMrs Thatcher has not been previously noted\nfor her outspoken attacks on authoritarian\ngovernments in Latin America; indeed she has\ngiven explicit support to the involvement of the\nUnited States in El Salvador( where the\ngovernment find it hard to distinguish between\ncommunists and catholics which is odd to say\nthe least). Why are the Falkland Islands so\nspecial then\u2014on past record Mrs Thatcher\nshould welcome the extension of an authoritarian government to areas where the\nwill of the people had previously been the chief\nfactor in the governmental process.\nYet she is spending millions of pounds in\nendeavour ing to recover the Islands (and as I write this, the might of British power has just\novercome 44 members of the Argentine army\nin South Georgia); why? The answer is quite\nsimple: if she does not make some gesture\nthen she would be removed from office by the\nconservative party who cannot stand the\nthought of a British national humiliation as if\nsuch virility symbols mattered today.\nYet whose fault is it that we are in the mess\nthat we are? Tie government's. This is a typical example of the incompetence displayed\nby the government in the three years that it\nhas been in office. They were elected on the\npromise that they would put the economy in\norder, restore law and order to society and\nprovide us with an effective defence strategy.\nIn the three years since the government came\nto office unemployment has doubled, inflation\nis not that much lower than when they came to\noffice (and for a long period it was considerably\nhigher) and they have failed to control the\nPSB R.On law and order they (and especially\nthat ineffectual Home Secretary William Whitelaw) have presided over a drastic increase in crime statistics and the worse civil\ndisturbances on the mainland in the living\nmemory of most people. And now in the one\narea where conservative governments are\ntraditionally supposed to be competent \u2014\ndefence and foreign affairs \u2014 they have\npresided over the greatest failure since Suez\n(also a conservative failure).\nFor the government to bleat that it could\nhave done nothing to prevent the occupation\nof the Falkland Islands is a downright perversion of the truth. Our greatest Foreign\nSecretary since the war David Owen prevented the Argentines taking over the\nFalkland Islands in 1977 by sending a task\nforce before a landing not after it. This fact has\nnot been denied by the government who are\nprobably too ashamed. Incidentally the reason\nwhy David Owen has a bad reputation is that\nhe was far too good at his job which could not\nbe tolerated by the officials of the Foreign\nOffice. Thus the father of the chairman of the\nConservative Society here, who is our man in\nJapan, has told his son\u2014William Cort azzi \u2014\nthat David Owen was a bad Foreign Secretary.\nFor a paid official to give their opinion, especially deliberately incorrect ones, based\non envy and hatred, about their democratically\nelected master, is bad form to say the i cast. These are the sort of people who are running\nthe country at the moment and they are not to\nbe trusted.\nIs there anything that you can do to help put\nthe situation right? On May6 the local\nelections are taking place and by voting for\nyour SDP/Liberal Alliance candidate you will\nbe giving Mrs Thatcher notice to quit. Do not\nbe taken in by the military atmosphere in the\ncountry at the moment; it is simply a political\nploy to save Thatcher's government; all right\nwing governments resort to foreign adventures\nwhen their home policy has failed.\nVote Alliance and say that Thatcher and the\nTory Party must go.\n\u2022 JWU WWW WS WWV WWW WU WV SOUTHSIDE SHOP Opening Hours\nMon-Thurs 8:30-2:30; 3:30-6:00.\nFri 8:30-2:30; 4:30-6:00.\nSat 8:30-2:30; 3:30-6:00.\nFind out about Marketing Management\nand see if it would suit you...

Honorary Secretary' s Business.\n6. CCU Reports.\n7. Other Officers' Reports.\n8. | Mot ions.\nPRESIDENT'S REPORT\nSome of my report is rehashed from the emergency meeting on\n25th March but I will start with a matter which must be\nminuted:_ Deputy President. Barney McCabe resigned with effect from April2 nd1982. The Executive held an emergency meeting on 25th March and\nappointed Christine Teller as Acting Deputy President. It is both impractical to run an election this term and\nridiculous to expect anybody to stand for the post of\nDeputy President for a couple of months when exams are\nlooming. We must remain with an acting Deputy President. I make the following recommendations to this UGM:i) Endorse the Executive's appointment of Christine as\nActing Deputy President. ii) In view of the work load, offer some reward, not in the\nform of a salary but in the form of paying the rent for58 Be it Hall where Chris is now living.( Incidentally this was the arrangement before the post was made\nsabbatical). iii) Authorise that Christine' s name is engraved on the\nDeputy President's pot and added to the Honours Board\nin the Union Dining Hall. Sick Bay.\nThe health service is under considerable pressure to reduce\ncosts( like the whole College) and the area most threatened is the sick bay. The proposal is to charge first year\nresidents a compulsory insurance premium (about \u00a310) on\ntheir first hall bill. This will' entitle individuals to free sick bay treatment for3 years. First years not in hall will be able to join voluntarily. A system will be\nworked out for second and third years. I was initially against a compulsory insurance but have changed my mind\nsince it is that or no sick bay. I propose we accept the\nidea in principle. Redundancies.\nThe Rector presented a plan at the last Governing Body\nfor redundancies, again emphasizing that they may not be\nnecessary in the near future. The College branch of the\nAUT have ideas for raising or saving money to prevent\nredundancies. Some of these ideas directly affect students so I sent my comments in writing to Governing Body.\nChancellor's Glass. I attended a reception for the Chancellor, HRH Princess Anne, at ULU and cleverly obtained the very glass from\nwhich she was drinking,( Coke l).I hope the Rag Chairman\nwill be able to raffle this magnificent trophy at this meeting.\nChancellor's Behaviour. Talking of HRH I still have not satisfactorily resolved the buffalo/ tiger affair but it is in hand.\nResidence.\nThe idea of paying rent over the vacation as discussed last term has been shelved. A number of cleaners in the halls are retiring this summer\nand will not be replaced. The current standards of cleaning will be maintained with as light drop in the frequency of\ncleaning stairs and landings but the linen service will disappear. This means dirty sheets and pillowcases will not\nbe replaced by clean ones as happens at present on a weekly\nbs.sis. Discussions are continuing on the provision of the\nlinen itself and I would like to see a central voluntary hiring facility. This way students will have the choice of\nhiring linen or bringing their own. This proposed withdrawal of service is subject the provision of a central laundry facility which should be of benefit to the whole\nCollege. The net savings on laundry bills and cleaners from the steps outlined above will be between 7 and 8% of a students weekly rent. Refectories. The Southside Refectory has finally moved downstairs. It is essential that the Union gets feedback from students on\nthe quality of the food in the new setup. Please in form me or Marco of any complaints, suggestions or even\ncompliments. If the complaints box has moved downstairs, simply use that. And now a few words about the outside world: Cost of Living Survey.\nIf you are amongst the lucky200 who have been randomly\nselected for this survey, please fill it in and send it back to the Union.\nThis has become particularly important since Christopher Price, M.P., Chairman of the Commons Select Committee on\nEducation is keen to learn the results. Thanks to Simon Rodan for coordinating this survey.\nStudent Loans.\nThe government has once again shelved plans for introducing loans as part replacement for student grants. This is not\nbecause they have gone off the idea but because the\nlegislation is too complicated and would probably not get\nthrough Parliament during this governments life time. Whatever the reasons, the shelving is good news.\nOverseas Students and the NHS.\nAnd now the bad news, (but it could have been worse).\nOverseas visitors registering with a doctor after October\n1st1982 are to pay fees for Hospital treatment. It seems\nG.P. treatment will remain free to Overseas Students though\nwith other visitors this will be up to the G.P. himself. The concession is that visitors( including students) who\nhave been resident in the U.K., for more than 12 months will get full NHS treatment. This is of little use to students on\none year M. Sc. courses.' My apologies for not reporting this to an earlier meeting.\nIt is an important issue and UKCOSA are continuing to look\ninto it. Open Door.\nOur programme was screened on 17th April; I hope many of you\nsaw it. I was reasonably pleased with the end result. A very special thank you must go to Lawrence Windley who gave\nup vast amounts of time to help with planning and production. REPORT OF ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT\nTV shop wi11 be having a sale of sports goods starting on\nMay IOI.h at 11am.

I bet you all had a long and lazy\nvacation and are now enjoying the 2 week\ncrash course in examination stress. I hope\nyou're not too busy to carry on reading\nthroughout the term and will continue to send\nin letters (note absence of this week), puzzle\nentries, donations to the riJ editors' fund and\nso on.\nLife After McCabe\nBarney McCabe's name seems to be dirt in the\nUnion Office at the moment while the acting\nDP, Miss Christine Teller, seems to have been\ninstalled as a veritable deity. Why, even well\nliked ICU President Nick Morton said that \"in\nIf all of Primelia College was populated with\npure and applied mathematicians then perhaps\nI could cope. Pure mathematicians tell the\ntruth, applied mathematicians lie: all very\nstraightforward. Statisticians in their\nmisguided attempts to be unbiased alternate\ntruth with falsehood and this can be bad\nenough, but I have found that physicists have\nno notion of truth and falsehood and are quite\nprepared to answer questions at random.\nAnything, it seems, to confirm the experimental results.\nI met three staff members in the bar last\nweek, and from their conversation it became\nclear that two were mathematicians, one pure\nand one applied, and one was a physicist.\nSince I had no idea which was which, I asked\nGeorge and Fred what discipline Harry\nbelonged to. On receiving the same answer\nfrom each, I asked George and Harry what\ndiscipline Fred belonged to. Again the two\nwere in agreement. Finally I asked Fred about\nHarry, and his answer enabled me to be sure\nof the disciplines of all three. Who is what?\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me at\nthe FELIX Office, please.

He\nwas adamant that Barney McCabe was doing a great job then, so he seems to have had a major change of opinion.\nMind you, Christine is doing a good job (I think that the U GM on Tuesday should ratify\nher appointment) and perhaps it is her efforts\nwhich have lead Nick to re-estimate Barney's( and surely his own) performance.\nDuncan Campbell\nOn Tuesday at 7:30pm Duncan Campell, the\nwell-known investigative journalist, will be\nlecturing to the London Student Journalist\nGroup at UL U.
