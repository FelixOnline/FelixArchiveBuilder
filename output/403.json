    "content": "FILIX\n11\nThe 19th London Film Festival\n\"Welfare\"\n(USA 1975. Dir. Frederick Wiseman)\nFormerly a professor of law at Boston,\nwiseman began making documentaries on\nAmerican institutions and organisations\nduring the mid-60's including, to date,\na high school, a hospital, an army base,\na police station and a private research\ncentre. Rarely seen in this country but\nwidely shown on TV and round the\ncollege circuits in the USA he created a new concept in documentary film making\n- no commentary,talk over or leading\nquestions from an interviewer \u2014 just a photographic record of what he terms\n'normalcy'. Completely oblivious to the\ncamera, 'normalcy' often turns out to be\nfar more bizarre than anything else. After his last film \"Prinate\" (which\nunfortunately had the intrinsic bias of\nbeing man against monkey), \"Welfare\"\ntakes a long look at the intricacies of\nthe American welfare system.\nAlthough vastly more complex than\nthe British system (Catch \u201422 regulations\nin hieroglyphics!) this is perhaps the\nmost relevant to us of Wiseman's films,\nparticularly in view of our rising\nunemployment. Clients at the Waverely\nCentre in New York include the jobless,\nhomeless, elderly and hungry from a wide cross section. of the city' s poor,\nboth black and white \u2014 a fact that\nsurprises many Americans apparently\nunder the impression that the welfare\nsystem is a black institution. Any\nc/ nic isms one might have that the\nclients are 'trying it on' are soon\ndispelled as Wiseman follows several\ncase histories coming back to them;\nagain and again for long periods of time\n(the film is over 2V* hours long!), day\nafter day as the clients are shuttled\nfrom one room to another clutching a fistful of forms, endlessly repeating\nthemselves in a futile attempt to make\nthemselves understood. But the case workers, sometimes cutting- through the\nred-tape in their quest for the facts,\nare not the or ges that they appear to\nbe to the clients; as facts get mislaid, forms lost and clients more 'paranoid'\nwe finally see tempers fray and realise\nthat caseworkers and clients are victims\nof a monstrous and inhuman system.\n\"The Emigma of Kaspar Hauser\"\n(each Man for Himself and God Against AH)\n(West Germany, 1974. Dir. We r er Herzog)\nAmazing! You must see it! (Now\nshowing at the Paris Pallman \u2014 cheap\nnights for students Mondays and Tuesdays75 p, or, if you want to be obscure at the\nnew Phoenix, East Finchley)\nFrom Nov 17th to Sunday Dec 6th London is host to what is often referred\nto as the ' Festival of Festivals' with\n59 feature films (plus many shorts)\nfrom 29 countries including the Grand.\nPrize winner from every major film\nfestival held during the past 12 months.\nDocumentary films are well represented\n(see \"Welfare\" reviewed below) but the\nrange is wide; films still to be shown\ninclude 'Sophisticated Kung-Fu' from\nHong Kong(\"4 Touch of Zen\" l st and\n3rd Dec), A Japanese disaster movie\n(\"The Bullet Train\" 2nd and 4th Dec.)\nand the controversial and bizarre (not to\nmention banned) \"Texas Chain Saw\nMassacre\" (Dec 6th \u2014 members only).\nAlso showing are several international\nselect io us from recent festivals, \"The\nBest of Annecy\" (10th International\nanimated Film Festival29 th/30 th Nov.) and \"The Best of Cracow\" (6th Dec.) are still to come.\nAnyone who would like further\ninformation should see the full programme\nin the FELIX office.\n\"Winstanley\"\n(Great Britain, 1975. Dir. Kevin Brownlow,\nAndre Mollo)\nThe opening film of the festival\n\" Win stanley\" tells the surprising story\nof what was probably the world's first\ncommune based on a communist philosophy, set up in 1649 on George'sHill, Surrey - ironically a sight now\noccupied by the stockbroker belt.\nTaken from the novel 'Comrade Jacob'\nby David Cante and the writings of\nGerrard \u2022 Winstanley, a Cromwellian\nsoldier and founder of the commune,\nthe film brings out many of the problems\nimplicit\" in a communist philosophy, not\nleast applied problems such as self-sufficiency, still relevant today over\n300 years later. Following a great\nrevolution as it did the settlement\ndid not face instant annihilation as it\nmight have done a few years earlier\n(or today) but w^s given a chance by\nthe powers on high (then Lord General\nFairfax) only to be wounded and destroyed\nby the local Lord of the Manor/pastor\nand his ' middle class' cronies.\nThe opening battle scene \u2014 in the\ndirector's words like \" a17 th century\nmovie tone news!\", effectively cut to\nthe Prokofier music for Eisenstein' s battle on the ice Alexandar Nevskyuses real armour (since replicas would\nbe too expensive!) and sets a standard\nof fastidious, if somewhat unnoticed\nat time, attention to detail necessitating\ndismantling an ancient dam and\ntransporting it from Essex to Surrey;\nmanufacture of 150 fifteen foot pikes\nand peasants' boots copied from one\nof the few pairs still existing; chickens from Rare Breeding Birds Society;\ninteriors shot in 17th century Chastleton\nHouse containing original furniture and\ntapestries and court scenes from the\noldest active court house in the country\nat Malmesbury, Wiltshire. Even the\nsound track had to be re-recorded for\nthe exterior shots (due to the proximity\nof the Heathrow flight path) and an\nOrnithologist detailed to pick out any\nunoriginal birds. A pity then, that\nafter, all this, the starving peasants\nlook less than convincing.\n\"Fear of Fear\"\n(West Germany, 1975. Dir Ralner Weiner.\nFassbinder)\nFollowing F as s binder's success with \"Fear Eats the Soul\" which was\nrecently shown on TV, the festival is\nshowing all three of his1975 productions.\n\"Fox\" (a cruel tale of homosexuality)\nwill soon be released at the Gate\ncinema whilst the fate of the other\ntwo, \"Fear of Fear\" and \"Mother\nKiister's Trip to Heaven\", is, like many (50) of the festival films, uncertain.\n\" Fear of Fear\" deals with a young\nwife's depression, brought on by a limp\nmarriage to a rather Insensitive husband\n(\"too busy dear\"), which feeds on\nitself like one of RD Laing' s rather\nnastier 'knot' until she sees herself in\nthe mirror as a stranger. Is it the fear\nof madness? It doesn't matter, it's a self-alienation she' s afraid of and it\nputs her in serious threat of a nervous\nbreakdown; her attempted escapes\nseem only to drag her further down as\nshe tries in turn v allium, the Chemist\nwho dispenses it, daylight drinking,\nobsession al swimming and finally a halfhearted attempt at wrist cutting (hubby\nfinally rouses himself).\nPersonally I hungered for greater\ninsight into her mind \u2014 the abstract\nbeing one of the cinemas greatest\npotentials (cf Polanski' s\" Repulsion\"; Altman' s\" Images\"); instead we are\ntreated to a few phoney 'distorted-bit-of-glass-in-front-of-the-lens' techniques every\ntime she looks in the mirror and one\nbrief, but memorable (as it enabled us\nas an English audience to whip off\nthe ghastly earphone commentary\nheadgear!) episode where her thoughts\nare echoed in a neatly edited Leonard\nCohan LP Taken as it stands \" Fear of Fear\" provides some superbly acted, if\nsomewhat superficial, reasoning to\nexplain why more than twice as many\nwomen as men suffer from mental\n\u2022 \" ' health David Thompson\nCHIEF PNG-INJEER.\nMR..S CHLO P Hl=iS 6 EA MED id\nMONSTER.

    "content": "F tUX RUG U LOSE RUGBY by Christophec Cuthbertson\nBY ONE O' CLOCK fifteen\nplayers were assembled and\ncontemplating fourteen kits.\nJohn Thomas had employed\nthe morning rag-collecting\nand had contrived to get his kit locked in the RSC Union\noffice. A scramble ensues.'.\nSecurity guards were found\narid then lost again, and all to no avail, the Union office\nremaining stubbornly locked.\nWe set off. John was hustled\non to the coach wearing his lab coat, still clutching his collecting can and collecting only short change from the\nrest of the team.\nWe arrived at Ealing' s ground and dismissed our\ncoach, only to discover\nfive minutes later that we\nwere in the wrong place and\nneeded it badly. However,\nimprovised transport was soon rustled up in the shape\nof Stan Nichol's exceedingly\nsmall van into which umpteen\nplayers and the supporters\nclub were crammed. A; twenty-minute, breathtaking\nrace through Ealing left us\nno shape to do anything, let\nalone play rugby.\nA sprint through the park,\na rapid change, and we were\non the pitch by three o' clock: but there was no sign of the\nopposition. They soon turned\nup and the game commenced,\nthe A's playing with their\nbacks to the setting sun.\nIt was soon apparent that\nit was going to be a tough\ngame. The A's started well, scoring an excellent try in\nthe first few minutes. The\nball went down tone backs,\nChris Becque taking a difficult pass and feeding out\nto Jim Pitcher who ran in\nthe try from a good thirty\nyards out. Ealing were much\nstronger in the pack, and in\nour eagerness to overcome\nthat, we gave away a penalty\n(or, at least, the referee\nawarded a penalty in front of\nour posts. It was converted.\nThe A's came back and\nshortly before half time\nscored a second try. Steve\nBraund<. broke through anc\nfed the ball to Rich Jenner\nwho scored. That put the\nA's8.3 up at half time.\nUnfortunately, over confidence eroded skill, and Ealincf were allowed\nin to score a lucky try.\nAt the at point John Fishburn\nnarrowly missed with a difficult kick.' The turning\npoint was Ealing' s second\ntry. Rich Pullen who played\nwell had to deal with a high ball over our line. He tried to ground it but it bounced\n.free and let Ealing in. The A's, de moral is ed, let Ealing run in another try to win 15\u20143.\nThis was a game the A's could have won. We suffered\nfrom not having had a game\nthe previous week ( UC failing to put in an appearance)\nand from becoming over-confident. We hope for a better result next week.\nTeam: R Pullen, J Thomas,\nA Howel, C Becque, J Pitcher, H Duncan, Al-Harery,\nB Bubb, S Dowing, M Zamorotko, K Hawkins, C Cuthbertson, F Fishburn, R Jenner, S Braund.\nImperial College 1st XV 12\nWasps II 32\nIC 1ST XV put up a very\ncreditable performance on\nSaturday 22nd November\nbefore losing to a very strong\nWasps II team. After a mistake by the backs had\ngiven Wasps a gift try in the\n1st minute: IC fought back\nwell, pinning Wasps in their\nown half with fine forward\nplay and tactical kicking at\nhalf back. Andy Devaney was\nin form with is place kicking\nand IC fought their way into a9 \u20146 lead, when another\ndefensive mistake gave Wasps\na second try. However IC\nagain responded well to the\nchallenge, and had their\ncaptain not fluffed a simple\npushover try, they could have\nbeen in a very strong position\nat half time. As it was, they\nturned around 15\u20149 in arrears.\nIn the second half, the IC\nforwards showed again and\nagain how much they have\nimproved in recent weeks,\nboth in the tight and in the\nloose. However the Wasps\noutside half, who had an\noutstanding match, set them\nup for two more tries, and\na score of 30\u201412, which\ndefinitely did not do justice\nto IC.\nThe forward play was magnificent in all phases,\nand apart from a few lapses,\nthe backs defended well. With\nan improvement in handling\nI am confident that the team\nwill really blossom. \u2022\nTeam: Sorry folks as a number\nof the names are not readable\nwe are not able to prim the\nteam.\nPaul Robins IS WAI NISH SWIMMING(& WATER POLO) Imperial College 43 Royal Holloway College 29\nLAST FRIDAY, Royal\nHolloway College became IC's first victims of the year at\nswimming. Later on we finished off the job when\nour second team beat them\nat water-polo.\nThe swimming match started\noff well for us, when we had\na1 \u20142 in the first event, the\n100m freestyle. In the next\nevent, Andy was just beaten\nin the brea stroke, and Colin was third. A reversal of the\n100m freestyle placing was made when Dave beat Rory\non the touch, in the 200m freestyle. The official time\nkeeper Toni, was unable to\nseparate them on the stop\nwatch. In the backstroke,\nPaul, an exile from last\nyear took advantage of\neveryone's tiredness at this\nstage, and scorched up and down to come first, with Ian\nsecond. The last individual\nevent was the medley in\nwhich Nick showed that he\nhad learned at school, to win convincingly.\nIn the two relays we entered three teams. In the\nmedley relay we were first,\nsecond and fourth, and we\ncame first and second in the\nfreestyle relay as well. At the end when the points were\ntotaled we had won convincingly\n4 3 - 2 9 . We now hope that we can keep up this form in\nnext week'sULU gala, and so\nretain the College Championship.\nAfter the swimming, our\nseconds (composed mainly of\nfirst years) beat Holloway 5\u20142\nin the water-polo match. In\nthe first quarter we started\noff badly when a player of some\nexperience put two goals\npast our unsuspecting defense.\nAfter the second quarter the\nteam got to grips with the\ngame. Dave in the 'hole', after\na verbal lashing, began to\nstart pivoting the attacks, and\nwas well supported by Sam.\nIn midfield Colin and Amir\ndid a good job in supporting\nthe forwards, coming back\nto defend, when required. Ian\nwas sound in defence and\nGeorge played well despite\nhis bad leg. Jim performed\nsolidly in goal, and showed\na greater sense of purpose\nthan usual probably because\nhe had just been elevated to\nthe post of official starter for\nthe swimming match. Ton i's experience proved useful in\ngetting us back into the\nmatch. In the second quarter\nwe drew level, thanks to a terrific shot from Sam which went into the top corner of\nthe net and then Amir got the\nfirst .goal of his hat-trick. In\nthe last two quarters, our\nfitness b came e obvious and\nwith two more goals from\nAmir, and an effort from\nColin we finished up the 5\u20142\nwinners. Then we returned to\nthe bar.-Finally we must mention\nthat we have just been declared\nwinners of the Middlesex\nLeague Second Division1975( on goal average), and\nwinners of the London Winter\nknockout 1975. The first\nteam won their recent match\n1 3 - 1 against Hounslow in the first round of this years,\ncompetition.\nFOLIA CEO US FOOTBALL Imperial College 1st AFC4 Royal Free Hospital 1st1 NEEDING A NEARLY GOAL to restore confidence from\ntheir dismal performances of\nlate, IC were thwarted by\npoor finishing. However a scramble ensued in the\nRoyal Free goal area early\nin the game and Steve Bates\ncalmly kicked the ball out\nof the keepers hands into the\nempty net. Pressure was continued in their half and\nPhil Singleton pressed home\nthe advantage with a fine\ncross shot to make it 2\u20140.The second half saw\na complete change in play.\nRoyal Free applied the thumbscrews but skillful defensive\nplay with Dave Brabbin\ndominant in the air,E an Huntington masterful on the\nground and some brave keeping\nfrom Kev Allen kept them out.\nYet a crack was somehow\nfound and IC were up against\nit with a narrow 2\u20141 lead.\nPressure on the IC goal\ncontinued till the Royal\nFree keeper made a dash down\nthe right wing, the ball found\nits way to Master Bates who\nwas thinking of passing till choruses of ' Do a Pete' from\nthe back found their way to\nhis sensitive ears. He looked\nup, measured the distance\n(with his infamous appendage)\nand let loose a blistering 45\nyard drive which found the\nnet before the keeper had\nreturned to his line. 3\u20141 and\nIC revived their superiority\nwith the new 'steam line o\" Terry Lindong bustling\nu productively, and rare\nflashes from both Gareth\nRoberts and Steve Gee.

    "content": "mix\nReviews Concerts\nGeorge Melly/Burlesque (Great Hall)\nHow can you explain the phenomenon\nthat is George Mell y?I mean, on the\nface of it, how the hell can an over-large, very English middle class, ex-public school ponce get away with\nsinging the blues without making a complete dildo of himself? Perhaps\nthe reason lies in the way he interpret es the songs so that they fit go well with\nhis persona; in no way does he try to\nauthenticate the blues with the twenties\nand thirties idiom that spawned them.\nThis, coupled with what seemingly is\nan inborn gift to be a naturally eccentric\nperformer, is why he has been accepted\nby jazz audience's throughout the years\nsince his original excursions fronting\nthe Mick Mulligan band of the fifties.\nAfter a short instrumental introduction\nby the Feetwarmers (John Chilton trumpet, Colin Bates piano, Chuck Smith drums and Barry Dylan bass).\nMelly came on stage to rapturous\napplause and was straight into his signature tune 'Good Time George', a song that just about sums up his act.\nIan Morse\nMuch of the repertoire dealt with the\nhedonistic pursuits he has encountered\nduring his not so sheltered life, the sort\nof experiences that crop up time and\nagain in his frank and often hilarious\nautobiography, 'Owning up'.\nAmong the many highlights of his set were the Ethel Walters' Song, 'Get\nup off your knees daddy, you can't win\nme back that way' (particularly en-lightening) and 'My Canary has circles\nunder its eyes'. During the act he went\nto great lengths to widen the interest in\nthe lyrics with h is humourous introductions\nand anecdotes, which entice on to\nI is ten to the often bri 1\n1 i ant interpret at ions.\nTowards the end of his performance\nthe audience, encouraged by a section\nof Mel ly's seemingly cult is t following,\njoined in the chorus of the well known\n'Nuts' and the 'Lobster Song'which\ncontains a rather dry line concerning\nthe parts of a male anatomy that beer\nsometimes reaches.\nAlthough their set was not up to\npar with the performance they gave in\nthe Union Refectory last month, Burlesque\nshowed that they are far better than\nthe present station they find themselves\n(ie playing the pub/small club circuit.)\nTo a certain degree the band seem to\nbe getting away from their previous\ninclination toward the musical inspiration\nof Frank Zappa, although the presence\nof the man's work is still to be heard\nespecially with their variation of Zappa's 'Be Bop Tango', where Burlesque\ninvite the audience to participate in\nmanic versions of the dance. The\nband display fine musicianship particularly the electric pianist and\nlunatic guitarist, who is a true showman.\nAmong the selections played were\n'Gorrilla Crunch!, 'Lana Turner',\n'Acupuncture' and the old Safaries\nnumber, 'Wipe Out'. They were s uprising ly well received, and as a result the\nEnts Committee will probably book\nthem again next term. (For a fuller\nreview of what they are about see\nFELIX400.) Records\nJoe Pass (At Montreaux '75) - (Pablo)\nThe first time I saw him. Joe Pass was being inconspicuous in a Beeb\u20142\nElla Fitzgerald\" in concert\" programme\nand what struck me was his economical\nplaying and his masterful lack of hair.\nThis latter aspect of Joe Pass is not too\nevident on the album, yet the smooth,\nmodest approach to his guitar \u2014\ntechnique has remained the foundation\nof his sound.\nSensibly enough, he opens with a track that all but the most leaden \u2014\neared will have heard \u2014 Stevie Wonder's\" You are the Sunshine of My Life\", thankfully without the armada of \" Funky C lau in ets\" that even Des O 'Connor\nprobably uses by now. The introductions\nover, he then moves into a number of\nhis own compositions and jazz standards,\nwhich are played with delicate respect\nto what is presumably, by their hushed\nsilence, a knowledgeable jazz audience.\nHis musical ability is beyond\nquestion' yet to \" listen\" throughout\nboth sides of this album and remain\ninterested and appreciative Of the\nslight variations as eash new track\nappears, is something for the committed\nguitar enthusiast and, due to the lack\nof any accompaniment, the numbers\nsoon begin to sound ominously similar. His talent might well be better show-cased within the context of a band which could supply the necessary variety, for\nafter a while, the 'sameness' of the\nplaying turns to tedium \u2014 the same\ntones, the same progressions, the same\nlimitations. Imagine Keith Emerson\nrestricted to acoustic piano, with no\naccompaniment, no vocals, no multi-tracking, and you might get a fair idea\nof how Joe Pa\u00a7s comes across here.\nHardly the stuff to scrabble your\naural senses. Dr Feelgood - Malpractice (UA)\nThis LP is \" raw\", there's not a spot of restraint in s iq ht, as the Feel goods fight and kick with their intention-ally devastating battering-ram of\nr 'nb rock and roll. If you haven't got\nthe Hifi wound up as far as it will go\nbefore the knobs start falling off and\nthe speakers start jumping out of their\nmountings, then you've missed the\nmessage. Ideal stuff to get the esp-saturated heavies rock in' their eyelids at the next stomp.\nWith effectiveness based on sheer\npower and simplicity \u2014 you won't get\nconfused by the time changes 'cos there\naren't any since the drummer only\nknows one rudimentary beat and he's sticking to it with clenched teeth. Anyway,\nif Status Quo can get away with it,\nwho's to stop the Kindly Doctor.\nBe\u2014Dop Deluxe \u2014 Axe Victim (Harvest)\nThis is the first album from Bebop\nDelux, which has since been followed\nby \" Futurama\", and soon the new one\n\"Sunburst Finished\" will be completed.\nThe band completely revolves around\none member and one instrument, Bill Nelson and the lead guitar being those\nin question. Combined they can produce\nsome pretty neat stuff, and although\nhe seems to have fallen into the Bowie\n/Harley/Hunter wasted-land as far as\nlyrical and vocal approach is concerned,\nthe raison d'e tre of all this becomes\nevident when the chords and runs start\nto fly from the silver strings.\nWith his ability there is no need at\nall for the mascara masque rack and the\ncamp pretty-boy vocals \u2014 so unnecessary.\nIf your penchant is racy, inventive lead\nguitar. Bill Nelson merits a listen and\nif he got a better band behind him and\ndropped the poseur rubbish, a truly top-flight artist could emerge.\n\" No trains to heaven\" exemplifies\nwhat this band's about - virtuoso\nfretboard work sur r rounding an adequate\nsong which becomes transformed into a thoroughly listenable, punchy 3 minutes,\nif he can keep the happy campers at\nbay with time he'll cut the imitators\nlike Trower to shreds.\nChris Farlowe - \"We can work it out\"\n(Poldyor)\nNever did like Chris Far lowe. Thought\nhe bugger ed up Col loss eum and detracted\nfrom the little that Atomic Rooster\nhad to offer. Now he mangles a Lennon\n\u2014Macartney composition by knocking\nout this soul \u2014 clich ed morass of conga-players galore, cutie cut Le background\nvocals, subhuman grunts et al - No way,\nDanno. His. appearance on TO TP a while back adequately confirmed all the\naforementioned assumptions. Sorry, but\nthe nicest thing I can say is that the\nB side would be listenable if it weren't for the singer.\nHie\nThe Law, Language and\nLenny Bruce (Phil Spector)\nWith the release of the long\nawaited Lenny Bruce film starring\nDust in Hoffman, the record market has\nnot s uprising ly been flooded with material\nby the late master of sater ical wit. So\nfar we' ve had at least five albums\nrecorded at various stages of the mans\nshort and tragic career.\nThis particular album was recorded\nfor prosperity by Phil Spector at an\nunstated night club, and is taken from\nthe period in his life when Bruce was\nstill wound up In his multiple battles\nwith his legal persecutors. Although\nusing his personal situation to great\nadvantage w l th hls brilliant parodies of\njudicial system, his obsession with his trials tend to occasionally border on\nboredom. Other selections Included on the\nalbum deal with familiar Bruce references\nto American sexual habits, religion and\nrace. As so often happens when a revival\nof interest in a particular artist Is In full\nswing one must sort out de sheet from de\nsugar as it were. For me, this album\noccasionally falls short of.the Tate and\nLyle bag. Anyone interested in finding\nwhy Bruce was such a master of irreverence\ncould do no better than to listen to his epic Carnegie Hall concert, available on\nUnited Artists..,. Ian Morse\n\n"

    "content": "mix5 Bar prices-reply\nSir, \u2014 It was with some\nconcern that I read last\nweek's is su* of FELIX containing Mr Ahlers' letter\nconcerning Bar Prices. To\nfind a fellow member of the\nICU Executive propounding\ntheories for which there is\nno factual basis, is perturbing\nto say the least. Mr Ahlers never has been, is not at the\nmoment, and in all probability\nnever will be on the Refectory\nCommittee or the Bar\nCommittee during his stay\nat College.\nTo reply to his letter in\ntwo parts, I shall first refer\nto his quote \" over the past\ntwo years we have seen a steady erosion in the price\ndifferential between the\nCollege bars and local public\nhouses\". In fact quite the\nreverse is true for many\nbeverages, for example,\nGuinness, two years ago cost\n2p more in the Ennismore\nthan the College bars, and\nat present the differential is\n5p. The next sentence reads\n\" In an effort to maximise\nprofits ... the Bar Committee\nopted for the layman's way\nout\" \u2014 what pathetic,\nlibelous drivel Mr Ahlers. The facts are Governing\nBody told the RefectoryCommittee \" to maximise bar\nprofits\". Refectory committee\nthen told the Bar Committee\n\" to review its pricing\nstructure in order to achieve\na gross mark-up of 35%.\nWhere is the opting for the\nlayman's way out? The Bar\ncommittee did not, in fact,\nhave any choice in the\nmatter.\nNext he says that \"indeed\ntakings are already down\". Totally irrelevant comment\nthis, since this was before\nthe prices were increased\nand is more due to the\nfinancial situation of the\nstudents rather than the\nbars finances.\nThe whole of the next\nparagraph is factually\nincorrect as Mr Ahlers should\nknow, as he works in the\nJ CR bar in the Sherfield\nBuilding where we charge\nall outside bookings using\nthat bar, at least 1p more\non all drinks consumed.\nFinally, instead of Mr\nAhlers \" urging the Bar\ncommittee I should\nlike to urge him to keep his\nramblings to himself until\nhe checks his facts. Also, it is not my desire to increase\nprices at all, and with this\nin mind, I made the recommendations to Council\n(which are printed in FELIX) concerning the future running\nof the bars to the benefit of\nthe student body.\nI remain Sir, your informed\nobedient servant,\nNPB RAY SHAW RSMU President\nChairman, Bar Committee\nHall fees\nSir, - Bearing in mind Peter\nTeague's comments on IC\nhall fees I would like to\na few comparisons with the\ncost and standard of\naccommodation in intercollegiate halls. I refer\nspecifically to International\nHall which, out of a total\nof 450, has a significant\nproportion of IC students.\nFirstly the rooms\nthemselves. These are of\nreasonable proportions but\nhave an inadequate size window, presumably to save\non heating bills. Heat is\nsupplied by a radiator\nwhich enthusiastically pumps\nout energy and often refuses\nto be turned off. The furnishing\nis simple if a somewhat\ndilapidated and the power\npoints cunning little two-amp\ndevices. The most notable\ndeficiency however, is the\nabsence of wash basins. Cooking facilities are\nnon-existent and indeed all but electric kettles are\nbanned. There are \" kitchenettes\" on every floor, but\neven here, cooking is banned\nand there is no equipment to\ncook on in any case.\nMeals are sub-college\nrefectory standard in quality\nbut adequate in quantity.\nThe breakfast is particularly\ngood and meals are provided\nat the weekends. Meals\nhowever, are part of the\nstandard hall fees and no\nrefund is available for uneaten\nmeals.\nThe final and most\ndevastating fact however, is\nthe cost. Intercollegiate halls unlike college halls get no\nsubsidy from the university\nand therefore have to break\neven. This means that the\nfees amount to \u00a3500 per\nsession as compared with\n\u00a3300 paid by IC hall residents.\nIntercollegiate halls have\nin fact the highest fees in the\ncountry. (Not quite, Westfield\nis top of this league\u2014Ed.)\nPersonally, I think IC hall\nresidents, especially Peter\nTeague should keep quiet\nand hope nobody notices.\nYours sincerely,\nN GREEN Life Sciences 1\nEDITORIAL There was a great deal of confusion over last week's issue of\nFELIX and quite understanding too! It was meant to be sold for\n5p with all the proceeds going to the Rag charities. However,\nMr John Kearns and his helpers failed to/turn-up in sufficient\nnumbers to help sell the paper and so the idea was dropped on\nthe Friday morning. We have received a few ballon fillers for\nthe front page photo but we are keeping it open until next Friday\nlunchtime. While we are still on Rag, JK asked to ask the\nfollowing people to come to the Union office and pick up their\nprizes from the Rag lottery. These are:- A Chodorowski, Dr\nHocking, D Rootron, Dave Dawes, Ed Clutton, Wilkinson (Green\n213),M Tilbury, Dr Hardwick, and Sue James.\nIt is always regretful when a Union officer is forced, for one\nreason or another, to resign from his or her post. It was doubly\nsad for us to hear of Keith Ahlers' resignation. We hope that he\nhas better luck in future and take this opportunity to congratulate\nhim on his contribution to both Guilds and ICU. Another case of resignation (sorry\u2014no pun intended) is that\nof Aston. They have decided to withdraw their membership to\nNUS by 893 to 332 votes. There has been steady but declining rate of d is affiliations, the peak being reached in 1970, but this is\nthe time a university has decided to do so. The consequences of\nthis move, wise or not, are far reaching especially when it\ncomes before the eve of an NUS national conference at which\nthe NUS constitution is to be debated.\nObviously, the decision d is affiliate is not a light one, however,\nit is a decision that can be taken without any background knowledge or information and this is dangerous. While the benefits\nof being a member of NUS may not be immediately clear, most\npeople are agreed that the student body as a whole, need to have\na nationally co-ordinated group. We must never lose sight of\nthis fact.\nWhat most students do not want to see is a group, similar to\nthe NUS executive, purporting to represent students interest,\nbeing run by a gang of political career is ts of any particular\ndenomination. 3ut we now reach an impasse. Students are not\nwilling, presumably because it does not concern them, to get\nup and take part in NUS, let alone their own unions, in order\nto achieve any changes.\nNo where is this more blatant than at Imperial College. Last week we saw a paltry number of IC students at a union meeting\nat which motions to NUS conference were to be discussed. If this is the prevailing attitude then it is quite clear that we\ndo not need UG Ms and furthermore that UG Ms should not be the\ncontrolling b do y of the Union. So what can we have instead?\nAn S RC( Students Representative Council) system? Or do we\nleave all decisions to the ICU Executive with possibly ratification\nby Council as in its present form?\nThese questions need answering and they need answering\nnow. I hope that those of you who read this article will stimulate\ndiscussion on the issues raised here.\nMy special thanks to Gill( heroine of heroines), Ian (super\nhero), Phil( hero) and other members of staff (great bunch) for\ntheir help In producing this week's issue. See you next week?\nft\nSTOIC at it again !\nEARLIER THIS MONTH, STOIC, IC's very own Student Television service recorded an interview with the actor, Dirk\nBograde, which was to have been shown next Tuesday. However,\ndue to minor problems, the interview is not yet ready for\nshowing, but STOIC hope to transmit it sometime before the\nend of term.\ntook place at the training\nstudio of the Educational\nTelevision Centre, 3at terse a where near broadcast standard\nfacilities are available. STOIC is allowed use of\nthe studio because many\nof their programmes, especially\nthe interviews, are broadcast\nover London through Channel\n7 of the ILEA closed circuit\ntelevision network. Channel\n7 is received by colleges,\nschools and universities\nall over London.\nThe programme, which\nwill include clips from \"The\nBlue Lamp' and \"The\nServant' as well as from\n' Permission to Kill\" is\nbeing edited today at the\nUniversity of London Audio\nVisual Aid Centre.\nMr Bogarde, well known\nfor his role as romantic\nfilm hero in the sixties, was\nin the country to promote\nhis latest film, ' Permission to\nKill'. In the film he plays the\npart of an intelligence agent,\nwho by devious means\nendeavours to prevent a political exile from returning\nto his country to start a revolution.\nThe interview is being\nregarded as something of a scoop; Mr Bogarde having\nonly been interviewed the\nday before by Russel Harty\nand on the same day (as the\nSTOIC interview) was interviewed by Tony Bilbo w for\nBBC'2s programme, ' Film Night'.\nThe STOIC interview\n\n"

We\nwere still one short, as one\nof the brave few didn't show\nup, having had a bit too much\ndrink the night before.\nAnyway, having decided\nthat this flake r wasn't going\nto come, the team set off to\nVictoria with much trepidation\nand a distinct feeling of\nimpending disaster. This feeling was well justified\n(although later proved wrong)\nas four of our number were\nlacking in experience, and\nthe rest hadn't played for five\nweeks. Also Lee (who play\nat Orpington) have a very\nstrong club. Their first\nteam has won the South of\nEngland Lacrosse League\nfor the last ten years. And\nso we arrived.\nLee gallantly lent us one\nof their younger players, and\non starting immediately\nscored three goals in as\nmany minutes. Surprisingly\nIC did not lose heart, but\nin fact improved dramatically.\nThe defense started working\ntogether, and although often\na man down, did a good job\nof breaking up Lee's attacks.\nThe midfield and attack,\nwhilst not being skilful\nenough to keep possession,\ndid, on being fed the ball\nfrom defense, often make\ndangerous runs at goal. This helped boost morale\nconsiderably, especially after c once e ding the first\nthree goals, when Derek\nSenner ran up and scored,\nand quite effectively stopped\nthe rot. At half time the\nscore was 5\u20144 in Imperial's favour.\nOn starting the second\nhalf Lee piled on the pressure,\nand got one goal back. However,\nagain the defense closed up\nand cut out the Lee attack.\nFor the next quarter of an\nhour a tooth and nail battle\nensued, in which both\nsides tried to gain an\nadvantage, neither side\never leading by more than\none goal. But suddenly, in\nthe last quarter, it all clicked again and IC quickly scored two goals while Lee\ntried but failed against a stalwart defense. This psychological advantage remained until the end of the\nmatch, leaving IC the victors\nby 11\u20148.\nA special mention should\ngo to Bill Jackson in defense,\nwho is improving week by\nweek, and to Derek Senner,\nwho has never played before,\nbut showed as much skill as many who have played\nfor years. With a bit more\npractice and match experience\nRe will prove an invaluable\nasset. I would also like to\nthank the whole team for\nproducing such a good\ndisplay, working so hard, and\nproving that the impossible)\ncan be done. Finally thanks\nto Lee, for being such good\nhosts, and giving us such an\nenjoyable match v Team: Pete Macbonald, BUI\nJackson, Bob Strangeway (Cpt),\nPaul Jepson, \"The Happy\nHacker\", Pete Watson, Derek\nSenner, Terry Gollogly, Alan\nMiddlehurst, Guest Lee player\nPS We are still interested\nin finding players and anybody\nwho would like to play should\ncontact me (Bob Strangeway,\nphysics PG) via the internal\nmail. HO LOM ORPHIC HOCKEY Imperial College 1st XI\nMill Hill HC\nAFTER A RATHER prolonged\nbus ride \u2014 taking over V/* hrs\nthe team arrived travel weary\nbut nevertheless eager to\nplay hockey, at Mill Hill. On\ncoming out onto the pitch we\nrealised that we would be at\na disadvantage not being\nused to playing on such an\nundulating and sloping pitch.\nThe game started on time and\nthe teams appeared to be fairly\nevenly matched, both sides making promising attacking\nmoves. The first goal came to\nMill Hill when slightly slack marking in the middle of the\n' D' allowed a Mill Hill player\nto receive a pass from the right\nwing and slot the ball home\nfor a goal. IC were, however,\nunperturbed and fought back\nand got a series of short\ncorners awarded. The goal\nwas scored from one of these \u2014\nMike Isles's shot was blocked\nby the goalie, Allen Brown\npicked up the rebound and\nafter a nifty piece of stick work put in a cracking shot from\nabout 10 yards. Not long\nafter though Mill Hill replied\nwith a second goal from a short\ncorner which beat the players\non the line by virtue of a deflection from someone's stick on the way towards goal.\nThe score remained at 2\u20141\n\u2022 at i half-time.\nIn the second half, play\ncontinued more or less as\nbefore and IC were unlucky not\nto score from either open\nplay or from several corners\nwhich were awarded during\nthe half. Mill Hill did not\nmiss chances, however, and\nscored two goals in the second\nhalf \u2014 both from corners.\nThe final score was a win to\nMill Hill4 goals to l. although\nthe result did not truly reflect\nthe relative abilities of the\ntwo teams.\nTeam: Charlie Brown, Jim\nMarshall (capt), Kim Houlden,\nAlistaire Ross, Allen Brown,\nIvan Hodgson, Chas Hardy,\nJohn Andrews, Trev Tutu,\nMike Isles, John Lattex,\nUmpire: Jasper Cook.\nBARNUM I ZED BADMINTON Imperial College II Mixed 5\nChelsea 1st Mixed 4\nAS THE SCORE suggests,\nit was close and almost\n\" e Iec tr if ing\" match, particularly towards the end.\nAfter ad is appin ting start,\nChelsea had one person\nready to play at the starting\ntime of 2.00pm, the remainder\narriving at about 3.30pm claiming ignorance of the\nmatch. So after an exceptional\nstart by all we were soon\nleading 4\u20141 needing only one\nmatch for victory. Then\nChelsea played their joker\n(having only pumps and no\nracket \u2014 an apt description)\ntheir 3rd pair proceeded to\nthrash the whole team, the\nmaximum score we obtained\nwas6. This brought the\nscore to 4\u20144, then Ian and\nClair played their worse\npair and clinched the match\nwith com par it ive ease and an\nalmost nonchalant attitude.\nThe girls deserve a special mention for their fortitude\neven when the opposition\ncontinually hits the shuttle\nat them, striking them on the\nface or upper trunk, they\nwere not daunted and are\nimproving in every match they\nplay.

Imperial College 0\nLondon Hospital 1\nTORN SCREAMING from their\nwarm track suits( and hats) IC\n1st XI faced London Hospital\nat Walthamstow on Wednesday.\nThrowing aside the\ndreadful memories of the\nprevious match IC soon\nraised their game to a remarkable level of mediocrity\nand forced a couple of corners.\nFrom one of these Mike\nIsles lashed a great shot\nagainst the upright. Encouraged\nbeyond belief at this the IC\ndefence promptly let 'Our\nCharlie' have a kick at the\nball. Rising to the bait he\ndutifully performed his\n'Wechishy' Miss( safely) and\neveryone relaxed, including\nthe LH forwards who weren't seen around for some time\nafterwards.\nIC forwards meanwhile,\naided by some good hockey\nfrom A Brown, forged deep\ninto foreign territory and\nallowed. themselves the\nluxury of a few more missed\ncorners.\nIn the second half IC\ndefended the goal patrolled\nby the opposition umpire whose\noccassional aberrations regarding obstruction and\ndangerous play reduced Ivan\nHodgson near to a mental\nbreakdown \u2014 John Andrews\ntoo, but it didn't show so\nmuch! IC pressed strongly for\na goal and even found time for\nsome fancy short passing in\nthe left flank area; after being\ncurtly instructed to cut out\nthis pansy sort of behaviour,\nthe left back hacked the LH inside forward near to death \u2014\nhonour satisfied. Sid Golding on the right\nwing split the opposition\ndefense twice with beautiful\ncrosses but nothing resulted\napart from a lucky clearance\noff the line. With three minutes to go\nLH forced a corner - obstruction\nthe man said \u2014 and shot a good goal.

Other units he proposed\nwere the Megalithic Rod, of\n2.5 Megalithic Yards, and the\nMegalithic Inch equal to one-four tie th of the Megalithic\nYard. Numerous plans and\nhistograms illustrated his point which culminated in an\nintricate exploration of the\nlayout of Avebury ' circle'. The second part of his lecture was devoted to the\nastronomy of stone rings\nand alignments. He showed\nhow the setting and rising\npoints of the sun, moon and\ncertain stars at particular\ntimes of the year were\naccurately indicated by stone\nalignments and distant\nforesight s. Further refinements\nof these ideas showed how\nMegalithic Man might have\nknown about the small\nperturbation in the moon's orbit, and hence may have\nbeen able to predict eclipses. Prof. Thorn indicated the\ndifficulty he experiences in\nconvincing the archaeological\ncommunity of the validity\nof his theories. Judging by\nthe questions and discussion of the audience, it seems he\nhad little difficulty in\ninteresting those present from\nthe scientific community of\nIC. The lecture was well\nreceived but was marred by\nlack of available time, and\nthe absence of a microphone.\nReferences for those\ninterested are; \" Megalithic Lunar Observatories\", both\nby a Thorn. For the real\naddicts of the theory, papers\noccur in the \" Journal of the\nHistory of Astronomy\". Michael Burrows\nPG ONE OF THE main tasks for\nIC Post Graduate Group has\nalways been the representation\nof the special interests of\nthose registered for higher\ndegrees. Over the last three\nyears a number of separate\nissues have been taken up\nwith varying degrees of\nsuccess. Now for the first\ntime there may well be the\npossibility of a broader\ndialogue on the present state\nof all kinds of post-graduate\nactivity. The establishment\nof a college working party on\nPG education which includes\nthree postgraduate students\nin its membership is a welcome\ninnovation. It will be judged\non the basis of any substantive\ncontribution to the educational\nexperiences of research and\nadvanced course students.\nIt is important that the\nchannel of representation\nprovided by the post-graduates\non this working party carries\nthe maximum possible amount\nof relevant opinion. At this\nstage the first priority is to\ngenerate a comprehensive\nlist of the problem areas\narising in each kind of post-AFFAIRS CORNER\ngraduate study. Some of the\nmatters for consideration\nwill be quality of supervision,\nthe role of formal courses, time\nscale of research and the use\nof facilities. In departments\nwhere an active post graduate\ngroup is already established\nrepresentatives will be\narranging informal lunchtime\nmeetings early in December.\nThere will also be a meeting\nopen to all postgraduates on\n2 Dec. at 1p minE lec Eng305. This will pro vi de the opportunity\nfor those in departments where\ngroups are not yet operating\nto specify the difficulties they encounter.\nThe usefulness of the\nworking party to post graduate\nstudents will depend on the\nsuccess with which problem\nareas are located.\nPLEASE SUPPORT THESE MEETINGS The post graduates on the\nworking party are:\nPete McCreath Ci vEng in t4258 Roshun Bird y Chem. int 4119\nRichard Upton Ind.

He would also like to see\nmilitant unions debating the\nissue, especially places like\nKent and Essex.\" It would\nbe even better if they\nd is affiliated\", he said. The reason behind As ton's decision to quit NUS was that many students there\nfelt that NUS was unrepresentative. Of the 332 who voted to\nstay in (893 voted to leave),\nmost of them did so because\nthey thought it would be\nmore useful to carry on the\nfight from within the existing\nstructure of NUS.

Peter Teague, ICU President, would like to see\nthe question debated at IC, but is worried that a decision\nmight be reached which was based on insufficient\nknowledge of what the NUS is and does. He does not\nfeel that As ton's action was a big enough jolt to the\nNUS but agreed that should\nthe motions on the NUS constitution be defeated,\nthere would be at least\ntwo or three more d is affiliations.\nTHE UNEXPECTED resignation of Keith Ahlers as President of City and Guilds Union last week, has left a considerable hole in the\nUnion structure. In addition\nto being President of C&G Union, he was also Vice President of Imperial College\nUnion. Under the Constitution, the Honorary Secretary of\nthe Union, Anne Pickard, becomes acting President\nuntil the election of a new\npresident.\nOnly one candidate has so far been nominated for\nthe presidency. He is Steve\nHoyle, Who is, at the moment,\nvice President of the Union. In order to be eligible for\nelection as President, Mr\nHoyle has had to resign as\nVP. His resignation is effective from l st December.\nThis has left the post of\nVP open and means that\nGuilds Union is now functioning\nwith only one of its top\nthree officers.

Organisation, by Rex Osborne, executive member responsible for drama, was almost non-existent and\nit was apparent that the paucity of participants was the result of\npoor communications, either between the NUS and college\nexecutives or between the executives and their drama groups.\nMany people had arrived with no idea of what was to be discussed, or what function the conference had within the complex structure\nof NUS. In fact it was explained that we could only elect and\n) panel, which would in turn advise the\nroni c that the decisions of previous\ncontrary to the spirit of the only NUS 'urge' an advisory ('ad,\nexecutive. It seems\nconferences have been\npolicy drama.\nFor the last two years\nthe . NUS has practised a boycott of the National\nStudent Drama Festival, the annual jamboree organised\nand financed by ' The Sunday\nTimes', through Mr Clive Wolfe. This boycott arose\nfrom Mr Wolfe's refusal to\naccept various demands\nmade by a previous conference,\nthe most controversial being\nthat the conference should\nelect students to the board,\nappointed by Mr Wolfe, which\nselects productions to go to\nthe festival.\nIt seems to be fundamental\nlaw of student life that the\nNUS and the students it\nsuo Dosed ly represents lead\ndifferent | j Ves.

This year\nmore than 120 groups entered\nfor the London festival, the method of selection, by\nprofessional theatre people,\nalso provides critical assess ment for productions, even\nif they cannot be selected.\nThe NUS now appears to have seen the error of its boycott, though it is not\nClear whether this is because\nthis year's festival is already\nunder way and student\nselectors could not be\nincluded at this late stage.\nA motion was presented by\nthe ad. panel which recommended that the NUS should be involved with the\nNS DF and should investigate\nthe ways in which they could\nPROF BREMSSTRAHLUNG\nHey Prof' Are\nyou m there?\nexcellent theatrically, might\nnot be \"the ur cup of tea\". Mr .Wolfe has. never made\nany secret of' the fact that\nhe wishes to select productions\nof the sole criterion of\ndramatic effectiveness and\nthus make the festival a showcase of the best in\nstudent drama. This attitude\ndoes not provide the democracy\nthat the NUS is so keen on. Mr Wolfe's organisation is that of a benevolent dictator;\nprovide assistance, particularly\nr.n the fields of communications\nand publicity. Of course,\nthere is no, possibility of the\nunion giving financial aid and\nthe festival must continue\nwith commercial sponsorship.\nThis year it was reported\nthat ' The Sunday Times'\ncould not continue its sponsorship. But, at the\nlast moment, the newspaper\nannounced that it would\ncontinue with the aid of\nco-sponsors, who turned out to\nbe the Scottish Tourist Board and the House of\nFraser.

    "content": "mm\nSPECIAL FEATURE Articles by Hie, Ian and Paul\nTHE PHENOMENON of \" Afro rock\", as\nit is known today, first appeared on ,the\nBritish music scene around 1969/70\nwhen a large amount of interest was\ngenerated by a sudden wave of African and West Indian bands who appeared\nfrom nowhere and presented their\naudiences with a new, energetic\nsound to get stuck into. The -vibes\nwent out and the ripples spread as these\ninfectious rhythms and time \u2014 signatures,\nthat have for centuries formed the\nmu sio al heritage of the African continent,\ntook hold and began to make their\nimportance felt on the college' and\nclub circuits. This innate ability of\nlatching onto a beat and improvising, at\nany speed, within its confines seems\nto flow through the veins of black\nmusicians. Many bands ( As saga i,J abul a, Noir) derived their 'sound'\nfrom the basic Afro-rhythms, but always present was one central outfit, head and\nshoulder above the rest, providing the\ndirection and stimulus that the others\nfollowed. The band was Os ibis a. When they started out, the members\nwere unknown outside of West Africa, but from the beginning they paved the\nway, remained the innovators and\nadded subtle Western influences to their\ninstinctive abilities. Throughout\ntheir career they have remained faithful\nto the original 'sound' while the rest\nhave disbanded or been sucked into\nother less-demanding areas of music. Teddy Osei (tenor 6a x, flute, percussion\nand father to the band's family) came\nover to Britain in 1969 with his brother\nMac Tontoh (trumpet, Fluegelhorn,\npercussion), Sol Amarfio - \" the Rhythm\nman\"( drums), and a friend Loughty\nLas is i Amao (Tenor sam, baritone sax, cong as) because of the restrictive\nmusic scene in Ghana.. Onto this\nfoundation they recruited Robert Bailey( keyboards), Wendell Richardson (a fine guitarist), and, spurt au is R, on bass,\ncompleted the lineup for \" the beautiful\nseven\". Their music at first consisted of\nroots - inspired percussive jam bores s, with Amartio the powerhouse timekeeper\nbehind the beat, and the well co-ordinated\nbrass trio playing the main melody\nin unison. Any gaps were soon filled\nwith layers of guitar and organ, whilst\nSpartacus R, as Amarfio's right-hand\nman, pumped the beat along at one\nmoment, and the next relaxed into a softer mood where flute or the shimmering\npercussive instruments had their solos\nhighlighted. At that time comparable\ncompetition was negligible and the\nfirst single \"Music For Gong Gong\"\nquickly found itself in the charts. In\n1971 they signed a five-year contract\nwith MCA find soon afterwards, the\nfirst album \"Osibisa\", aided and\nabetted by.some imaginative cover-work\nfrom Roger Dean, was well-received\nand established both supremacy in the\nAfrican rhythm field, and the music' s popularity. This LP had its fair share\nof gems but their real test, as usual, came with the release of the follow-up\n\"Woyaya\" in the same year. It turned\nout to be a tour-de-force and probably\nremains their most impressive effort,\nwith the delicate moods of \"Beautiful\nseven\", the expertly jazz-f inge d\"Y sharp\", and Rahsaan Roland Kirk' s \"Spirits up above\", the outstanding\ntracks. Here the simple raw energy\nand im media tia cy of -the first album had\nbeen broadened in scope and variety by\nthe blossoming of Richardson and the\nincreased confidence of Bailey to\nimprovise, allied to superior songwriting.\nTheir progression continued into the\n3rd album \"Heads\", but, by this time,\nthe initial impact of the rhythms was beginning to die down, and with the\nbands popularity slowly fading, internal\ndisagreements showed themselves for\nthe first time. These three albums\nremain their best to date.\nThe next year or so was a time of\nchange in which Spartacus R left,\nfollowed by Richardson, (now back with\nthem) and then Amao (at present with\nz zebra). In '73 the band knocked out a rather uninspired soundtrack LP for\n\"Superfly TNT\" with new members\nJean Mandengue (bass), Koti Ay ivor( percussion) and Gordon Hunte (guitar),\nelm fP*****4 PH. which sounded as if it had been completed\nto honour a contract and no.more. The\nfilm wasn't much cop either.\nThe revitalisation of Os ibis a came\nwith a move to Warners bros. in that\nyear, which resulted in the enjoyable\n\" Happy Children\" album and the rather\naverage \"Osibirock\" in '74, the latter\ntending a bit too close towards the\n'pop' side of the market to be rewarding.\nNevertheless, it was followed by the\nexcellent compilation, \"The best of\nOsibisa\" which could be quite an ear-opener if your collection at home is\ndevoid of their material. With the\nexception of the new one \"Welcome\nHome\" which should be released on\nNov 28th, that brings the band record-wise up to the present.\nTheir main problem, as with so\nmany bands, has always been to re-create\non record what they achieve live on\nstage. There they possess a care-free\njoie-de-viv re that makes some of the\n'' money-and-bus I ness-is al I'' mental i ty\nof European bands seem trivial by\ncomparison and when Os ibis a take to\nthe boards, they rant, they rave, but,\nabove all, they enjoy themselves \u2014 not\nby endlessly exhorting the audience to\n\" Paa art eee\" as is currently the\nobsession with the hordes of American\nsub-disco fodder that four these isles, Teddy Osei and Mac Tontoh\nWendell Richardson Kofi Ayivor\nPhotographs by Phil Dean\nbut by performing their own brand of\nspontaneous combustion. If you don't enjoy yourself when they're playing, it's your loss, but unless your metabolism\ntends towards the ice-block, good body-music will always have its effect, and\nhalf-way through a set this mob can\nturn on some stor ning stuff. They were\non at the Roundhouse last year with\n.Gouzaliz and koko nio( two ace bands\nwell worth checking out) and although\nthey didn't appear to be firing on all cylinders, the audience were going\nbananas all over the place.\nThat's what they're capable of, so if\nyou're not busy this Saturday (29th), make use of your IC privileges and\nfork out the 120p necessary. You shouldn't regret it.\nOs ibis a have come a long way since\ntheir inception with the hypnotic chants\nsung out over a constant background\nof chattering percussion. Constantly\nworking on the road, they've had their\nups and downs but a number of things\nremain unchanged. The three originals\nO sei, Tontoh and Amarfio are still there, looking after business and so\nare the batteries of hand-drums and talk-ing-drums, congas and timbale s that\nform the essence of their music. Hopefully\nthe new album will capture that essence\nonce more.\nSo, from the group that refreshes the\nparts other bands cannot reach \u2014 \"criss-cross rid dom s dat explode wi d hop pines s\". Enjoy them!\nJudging from last Sunday'sconce t at the De La Warr in Bexhill the group\nseem to be stronger than ever musically, particularly with the recent return of\nguitarist Wendell Richardson, who\ntogether with their exciting keyboards\nplayer, add a new dimension to Os ibis a. Starting with the familiar ' Dawn', they proceeded to play material from\ntheir new album, 'Welcome Home', which\nsounds as if it could be their best\nsince their initial outing ' Os ibis a'. The new single 'Sunshine Day', is\nmore commercial than their other chart\nattempts (and has more musical depth),\nthe song leaning more towards a Latin American inspiration rather than their\nAfrican roots. This was followed by\nanother new tune, 'Seaside Meditation',\nwhich displayed the more instrumental\nside of their music re mini cent of 'Why'\nfrom their last album, ' O sibi rock'. After an exciting 'percussive workout'\nshowing all the subtleties and complexities\nof their ry th ms, they played numbers\nfrom their previous albums. These included ' Fire',' Os ibis a' and of\ncourse their piece de resistance,\n' Music for Gong Gong' In which Richardson\nshowed what fine work he is capable\nof. Throughout they displayed great\nhumour which has always been a characteristic of their set.\nAs mentioned before, they are\nappearing here In the Great Hall tomorrow and we have been promised\na very special concert so see you there!\n\n"
