    "content": "college news\nRector sends PM warning\nSir Richard Sykes has called\nfor the creation of a group of\nelite universities to make\nBritain a world leader in science education.\nIn an interview with the\nFinancial Times published this\nweek, the College's Rectorwho is a member of the\nCouncil for Science and\nTechnology set up by the\nGovernment, and was recently\nappointed a member of the\nnew science policy strategy\nboard of the Department for\nTrade and Industry - called for\nthe establishment of twelve\nuniversities that would be free\nto charge students tuition fees\nat market rates that could\nexceed \u00a310,000 each year.\nThis, he believes, would\nenable the British higher education system to attract the\nbest students from around the\nglobe by offering \"the best\nconditions in the world.\"\nHis words were seen as a warning to the Prime Minister,\nTony Blair, who only last week\ntold the Royal Society in\nLondon that he wants \"to\nmake sure the UK is one of the\nbest places in the world to do\nscience.\" Sir Richard responded by claiming that it would\nbe impossible to have \"a successful science and technology policy without first tackling\nthe universities... the government has to concentrate on\nthe tertiary education system,\nwhich is in trouble, and do\nsomething radical.\"\nReferring to the inflexible\nfunding system currently in\nplace, he allegedly told the FT\n\"we have to compete internationally with one hand tied\nbehind our back.\"\nWhile Sir Richard conceded\nthat the idea of elite universities would be difficult to promote on a political level, especially to wealthier parents\nwho would bear much of the\nfinancial burden of the prop os als, he allegedly justified his\nplans to charge up to ten\ntimes the tuition fees currently\npaid by students at British\nuniversities by saying that\n\"middle class people pay a lot\nof money to send their children to private schools from\nthree to eighteen and then\nthey rail at the idea of paying\nfor tertiary education.\" It is\nthought that students from\npoorer backgrounds would be\nsupported through their time\nat these universities through a scheme of means-tested\nscholarships.\nThroughout all of this, how-ever, College officials have\ninsisted that Sir Richard has\nbeen misquoted, and assure\nstudents that the Rector will\ndiscuss this issue with them\nin the near future.

    "content": "film feature\nLive and In Person\nIt all started in September 1998, when an Australian actress\nbetter known for her famous husband than her acting ability-took to the stage at the Donmar Warehouse. Eight sell-out\nweeks, universal critical acclaim and a drooling British public\nlater, Nicole Kidman left the country with the kind of credibility\nand respect that most actors would die for. And it worked. No\nlonger an Aussie also-ran, she starred in two of the most critically acclaimed mainstream movies of 2001, has her pick of star\nroles, and picked up an Oscar nomination into the bargain.\nDramatic as her career turnaround has been, it might easily\nhave been dismissed as a fluke that had more to do with the\nplay's nudity (there was a lot of it) than her acting talent.\nHowever, when Macaulay Culkin revived his flagging career\nwith an appearance in Madame Melville in October 2000, the\npattern was set. American actors looking to lend their career a bit of credibility now have a new destination - the West End. In\nparticular, whilst Broadway critics drool over the prospect of\ntearing their performances to shreds, London's theatre reviewers are regarded as more forgiving, thereby tempting\nHollywood's finest across the pond - particularly as the US\nmedia tends to only pick up on the successes, thereby limiting\nthe chance of terminal embarrassment back home. The chance\nto spend a couple of months in London seems to appeal too, as\ndoes the opportunity to work with some of the hottest young\ndirectors (Sam Mendes, the man responsible for American\nBeauty, directed the Blue Room, whilst Shakespeare in Love\nh elmer John Madden has reunited with Gwyneth Paltrow for\nProof).\nAs a result, this summer will see the West End inundated by\nsome of the finest talent Hollywood has to offer. After eight\nweeks in the limelight, Anna Paquin and Hayden Christensen\nwere recently replaced by Matt Damon and Summer Phoenix in\nThis Is Our Youth. Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna have made\ntabloid headlines thanks to their appearances in Proof and Up\nfor Grabs respectively. Willem Dafoe recently starred in a short\nrun of To You, the Birdie! At the Riverside. Glen Close and\nSaffron Burrows are both lined up to star in (separate) productions at the National Theatre this summer. And the astoundingly talented Philip Seymour Hoffman recently led an acclaimed\nrun of Jesus Hopped the A Train. Quite frankly, you're more likely to catch your favourite star in action this summer via\nTicketmaster and Shaftesbury Avenue than via the Odeon and\nWarner Village.\nThe strangest knock-on effect of all this, however, has been\nfor British actors. None of these stars are here for the money\n(Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, will earn \u00a3300 a week for her\nrun at the Donmar) and they'll all have to put up with badly ventilated dressing rooms and the occasional spot of mould backstage - and it's for precisely these reasons that most British\nactors were only too happy to leave the stage behind them\nwhen fame, fortune and state-of-the-art trailers beckoned. Now,\nhowever, the trend that's been set by their US rivals is dragging\nthe Brits back into the West End. Ralph Fiennes has signed on\nfor a season at the NT this autumn, whilst Maggie Smith and\nJudi Dench will team up in The Breath of Life, Emily Watson will\ntackle Uncle Vanya and Twelfth Night, and Sean Bean will\nassay the role of Macbeth. Even Britain's busiest movie star,\nEwan McGregor, is looking to take to the stage later this year\n(although he has yet to find a suitable role).\nSo where will it all end? Who knows. These people certainly\naren't the best stage actors around, and if that's what you want,\nyou should look elsewhere. On the other hand, you'll rarely get\nthe chance to see stars who command upwards of \u00a35 million a movie for under \u00a320, so it really is a chance not to be missed. As\nvaluable as credibility and critical success may be, a lot of the\nUS actors are really here to take a break from an unforgiving\nwork environment which will rarely see them end the day with\na \"well done\", let alone a standing ovation - so go on, do your bit,\nhelp to make a movie star feel a little better, catch a bit of culture and have something really cool to tell your friends about\nthis summer.\nMany of these shows will sell out many weeks in advance, so\nfor your best chance of getting a ticket, call the theatre and find\nout when they release returns. You may have to turn up at an\nunpleasant time of the morning, but it's not exactly a long way\nto go. Plus it's a lot cheaper than buying from a tout.\n\n"

    "content": "sport active\nRuns, Wickets and Cups of Tea\nIt is typically the case with the\ncricket season that the rain\nonly comes the day before the\ngames, and this year has been\nno exception. The first two\ngames were both washed out,\ndespite glorious sunshine on\nthe day of the game, by heavy\nrain the day before and the\ninability of grounds men to\nread the weather forecast.\nHowever, the season got\nunderway for the IC 2nd XI\nagainst RUMS 2nd's on\nSunday the 12th May. The\npreparations didn't begin as\nplanned, with one of the players forgetting that we actually\nhad a game and Pete being\ndrafted in, still the worse for\nwear from the night before. We\neventually arrived (no thanks\nto the Union, who had provided a bus that left a trail of oil\nfor us to follow on the journey\nback), only a little late, and our\nskipper Gopi was persuaded\ninto batting first, if he won the\ntoss, by an opener very keen\nto score some runs.\nHe duly won the toss, we batted and the opener, Spuggy,\ngot 46 before managing to hit\nthe ball to one of the only players in the RUMS side who\ncould catch. The other opener\nhad already made his way\nback to the hutch, bringing a very timid Shagnasty to the\nwicket. He began very slowly,\nshowing that a good batsmen\nmust use all of the willow pro-vi ded, before he began smashing the very mediocre bowling\nall over the field, hitting a six\nto bring up both his fifty and\nhundred. Gopi also got 31, but\nwas beaten to third highest\nscore by the extras, who were\nhelped out by bowlers who\ncouldn't aim straight. Karan,\nyes that is his name, Rob and\nTom, helped bring the total to\n246 for 5 from 32.3 overs,\nbefore their captain persuaded\nus to end their misery and\ndeclare.\nAfter a very nice tea, which\nwas most appreciated by\nSpuggy, we set out onto the\nfield to bowl. We soon discovered that they couldn't bat\nvery well either, with only\nthree of their batsmen getting\ndouble-figure scores.\nEveryone bowled well, with\nSpuggy and Tom picking up\ntwo wickets each, and Gopi\nand a very excitable Hanut\ntaking three wickets apiece. A mention must go to Pete who\nbowled extremely well given\nrest of the batting line up\nwould not have looked out of\nplace in England's1st innings\nat Lords' last week, and\nrumour has it that some of the\nIC middle order batsmen have\nbeen called into the England\nsquad for the second test at\nEdgbaston. However, our captain had decided to leave his\nsecret weapons at the bottom\nof the order, Irish Pete (We did-n't know they played cricket in\nIreland) and Metronome (57\nnot out) putting on 100 for the\n8th wicket, rescuing us from a his problems focussing on the\nstumps at the other end. We\nhad bowled RUMS out for 114,\ngiving us a comprehensive\nwin by 132 runs.\nThe following Wednesday saw\nboth the 1st and 2nd XI's in\naction, against UCL l st's and\nLSE respectively. The 1st XI\nwere expecting an easy win against a 'weakened' UCL side, we were told they would\nhave to pick some women,\nwhich actually contained a ULU squad member, one more\nthan the IC side. Our captain,\nPumpman, won the toss and\ndecided to bat, and being captain decided to open the batting himself, along with Tom\nSterling. The pair started well,\nboth players getting into the\n20's before getting out. The\nmon u fucking-mental disaster.\nHowever, Pete got out for 43,\nbringing James to the crease,\nonly for him to walk back one\nball later. Most of the team\nthought he had cracked one\nthrough the covers for four, but\nthe more eagle-eyed spectators saw that he had in fact\nstood on his own wicket as\nwell, Kwality! After, the mid-dle-order collapse a score of\n190 after 40 overs was a reasonable total.\nAfter the tea-break the wild-west bowling partnership,\nJesse/James, opened the\nbowling. They both started\nwell, with James picking up\nhis wicket second-ball and\nMetronome making Glenn\nMcGrath look wayward.\nDespite some poor field placement by the skipper, several\nshots went through the slips\nat catch able height, Pete and\nPumpman, he must have got\nthe fielders in the right place\nfor his own bowling, took\nthree wickets each. Tom\nHodgson also got a wicket and\nMarcus avoided the Thanksfor-Coming prize by claiming a wicket as well. This reduced\nUCL to 95 all out, a win by 95\nruns.\nThe 2nd XI were due to play a fairly strong LSE side, but UL U had pinched a couple of their\nplayers on the morning of the\ngame, so we knew it would be\na close match. Our side batted\nfirst, and after a slow start by\nHussain, no relation to the\nEngland skipper, and Mike\n(30), Gopi (67 not out) and\nJulian (38) helped themselves\nto the buffet bowling. Suraj,\nKaran and Muhammad all\nhelped to get the side up to\n209 for 5 from 40 overs.\nThe 2nd XI set about their task\nof bowling LSE out with great\ndetermination, Hanut and\nDamien, who is more famous\nfor his command of the ball\nwhile batting, both picking up\na wicket. In fact none of the\nbowlers disgraced them-selves, everyone took a wick-et, but unfortunately the game\nproved to be a lot closer than\nwe'd have liked. LSE scored\nthe winning runs with four\nballs left in the innings. This\ndefeat meant that LSE, and\nnot IC 2nd's would progress\ninto the knockout stages of the\nUL Cup.\nThe 1st XI still wait to hear\ntheir fate, which looks likely to\nbe decided by the calculator of\nBecky Fawcett at ULU, if she\ndecides to come back from holiday in time anyway. Group A will almost certainly be decided by the run rate, since three\nteams look likely to finish on 4\npoints each.\n\n"

    "content": "music reviews\nThe Breeders\nTitle TK\nOut now on 4AD records\nKim and Kelley Deal return with another\nBreeders album chock full of indie-rock\ngoodness. Sounding a little more\nstripped-down and bare than the older\nmaterial, Title TK finds soft and scuzzy\nguitars picking their way across strange\nsong structures, whilst Kim smothers\nalmost unfathomable lyrics over the top\n(\"Has anyone seen the iguana?\" goes\none chorus). The whole thing is held\ntogether by the sheer beauty of the\narrangements.\nA lack of glossy production brings the\nintimacy of the songs into a sharp focus -close your eyes and the band could be\njamming on tiny little amps in the next\nroom, if it wasn't for the obscure sound\neffects that keep dropping into the songs\nfor a couple of seconds before disappear-ing.\nThe great little vocal harmonies put\ntogether by the Deal sisters gain a lot\nfrom the rawness of the sound, helped\nalong by the fact that their gravelly 40-a day voices are so similar. This is put to\ngreat use on opening track Little Fury.\nThe brilliant Off You finds Kim singing\nalong with a lone guitar and bass, sounding like someone at the far reaches of\nsadness, letting the heavy sighs\nbetween lines hang in with the music.\nAlthough the second half of Title TK\nstarts to sound a little alt-country, the\nalbum rarely strays from this minimalist\naura, and is the better for it. A welcome\nreturn.\nTitle TK was recorded by Steve Albini\nin Chicago. The Breeders play the Astoria\non Saturday and the Mean Fiddler on\nSunday.\nThe Supernaturals Belle & Sebastian\nWhat We Did Last Summer Storytelling\nOut this Monday on Koch records\nAs you may have read previously in these\npages, The Supernaturals once produced\nsuch gloriously fun records as Smile and\nLazy Lover, but their recent singles have\nbeen somewhat less than great. So\nwhat's the album like? Well unfortunate-ly, it seems that the mighty have fallen,\nand just as badly as I first feared.\nMy main criticism is that they have\nditched the crisp organ/guitar collaborations, and now seem to use a cheap keyboard to add Nintendo-style soundtracks\nto the songs, making it all sound ama-te uris h. Worse is the fact that they now\nsound like a new romantic band, and a bad one at that.\nThe only track that works is Life Is A Motorway, which shows that under all\nthe electronic noises and sequences lies\nthe talent that is desperate to be\nreleased. This is by far the best track on\nthe album, and is suitably cheesy and\nlight. It is a great shame that the rest just\ndon't match up.\nToo much of this album sounds as\nthough they are just putting on a brave\nface and trying to hide the turmoil under\ntheir skin. Hopefully the 'Naturals will\ncome out of their musical coma and produce songs like those of old again. And please ditch that keyboard!\nOut this Monday on Jeepster records\nThis album is an extended and half-cut\nsoundtrack of the Todd Solandz movie\nStorytelling. Belle and Sebastian were\noriginally taken on to write the music for\nthe second half of the movie, then asked\nto do it all, before being given just the\nsecond half again. Consequently, what\nyou have here are the basic pieces that\nthey wrote for the whole film, half of\nwhich were never used.\nSo what does this mean for the album?\nWell, as you go through it, you do get the\nimpression of a story being developed,\nbut without seeing the film you can't quite tell what that story is. However, I do know that I want to see it, as the\nmusic suggests that the film has a certain amount of depth and will make you\nthink.\nIn terms of the music, Belle and\nSebastian have done a good job of varying the pieces around a theme. The snippets of dialogue from the film which\nappear between tracks both help and\nhinder things - they help you to see\npieces of the story, but tend to interrupt\nthe flow of the album.\nAll in all, this is relaxing, having as it\ndoes that typical Belle and Sebastian lo-fi indie sound. But you get bored of it too\nquickly.\n\u00bb\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 Tank Tank\nID Ben\nALBUMS BELLE & SEBASTIAN - Storytelling\nGARY NUM AN Exposure\nDJ SHADOW - The Private Press\nTHE SUPERNATURALS - What We Did\nVARIOUS - Escape To Formentera\nOUT THIS WEEK Monday 3 June\nSINGLES\nBUSTA RHYMES - Pass The Courvoisier\nLAST MAN STANDING - Fate\nLIBERTINES - What A Waster\nNELLY - Hot In Herre\nSILT - In Line\n\n"

Their two talks\nfocus on the mathematics of chance and\nthe psychology of deception, offering up\nsome very bad jokes, some suspiciously\nuseful lifestyle tips and a lot of distinctly\nodd concepts along the way.\nWhat are the chances of that happening?\nby Simon Singh\nHaving studied Physics at Imperial\n(before moving to Cambridge for his PhD),\nSimon Singh rose to prominence in 1996\nwith the screening of his breakthrough\ndocumentary on the world's most famous\nmathematical puzzle, Fermat's Last\nTheorem. A BAFTA and an Emmy nomination later, he turned his hand to the\nwritten word, producing two of the bestselling maths books of all time - Fermat's Last Theorem and The Code Book - as a result. He is now an occasional TV and\nradio presenter, a frequent lecturer and a all round clever blok e. So anyway...\nWe live in a risk society, one in which\nthere are no surefire bets. Doctors offer\ntreatments with only a certain probability\nof success, climatologists discuss the\nlikelihood of global warming, and the\ndod gy chap on the street corner tempts\nus with games like 3-card Monty. But can\nmathematics help us to live longer, predict the future and beat the dealer? Take\na free bet, perhaps win a drink and learn\nabout probability through the experience\nof gambling.\nMental Trickery by Richard Wiseman\nHaving started his life as an award-win-ning professional magician, Dr Richard\nWiseman made a major left at the traffic\nlights when he turned his attentions to\npsychology, taking his doctorate at\nEdinburgh before moving to the\nUniversity of Hertfordshire, where he\nleads a team investigating the psychology of magic, chance and the paranormal.\nThere is more to magic than mere dextrous trickery, and in the second half of\nthe show, Richard exposes the psychology behind the tricks. There is more to a magician's trickery than sleigh t of hand,\nand however big your hands are, it helps\nto understand the workings of the human\nmind. Using magic tricks, demonstrations, video clips, mind games and lots of\naudience participation, Richard shows\nhow to become a master of deception.\nThe event will take place on the 11th of\nJune 2002 at 7pm in Lecture Theatre 1,\nPhysics, Imperial College. Tickets cost \u00a35\n(\u00a33 concessions), all of which will help to\nsupport this year's ICU Rag charities, and\nare on sale in the Union, the Physics\nUndergraduate Office, and from members\nof Rag.\nBandanna Week\nChoice. We're surrounded by it and it's great. A coffee preparation method for\nevery day of the year. \"Choose life\", as\nEwan McGregor says. Yes, very good.\nBut weren't the teenage years tough in\nthe choice department? You try to go\nclubbing but your mum/the bouncer/your\nD. OB says no. And all those career choi c es: \"What are you going to be when you\ngrow up?\", \"Where...\" etc\nSome teenagers don't have a choice\nthough. At an age when many people are\nchoosing to experiment with cigarettes\nand alcohol, the teen with cancer is being\npumped full of cytotoxic chemicals. The\ndose measured to be poisonous enough to\ncure you but not quite enough to kill you.\nAt an age when most are choosing to\nassert their individuality, the teen with\ncancer is going through devastating physical changes and in pain.\nThey have no choice about it, and it's simply not fair. And neither perhaps is the\ngeographical roulette wheel of the NHS\nwhich traditionally treats teenagers in\neither children's or adult oncology units,\nboth of which are far from ideal.\nThe Teenage Cancer Trust (TCC) was\nset up in 1990 in response to this gap in\ncare. Since then they have funded six dedicated teenage oncology units in the UK\nand have plans for 14 more over the next\n10 years.\nThe units are designed and run on the\nbasis of listening to those that know -teenagers in treatment and remission and\ntheir families. They bridge the gap\nbetween the needs of a dependant child\nand those of an independent adult.\nIndividualism is respected and, encouraged to question and ask, most patients\nare fluent in 'cancer language1. They not\nonly know the names of their drugs but\nwhich vein with which type of needle the\nnurses should use. The staff are lively and\nencouraging and there is an atmosphere\nof a youth club in the wards with music,\nposters on the wall, a pool table, computers and a separate room with TV and\ngames where the patients can hang out\nwithout staff or parents (unless invited in!)\nThis week is Bandanna Week 2002, the\nsecond year that the TCC has run this\nmassive fundraiser (\u00a3100k in 2001) to fund\ntheir ongoing work and raise awareness of\nthese issues in both the public and NHS\neyes. The Bandannas are designed by\ndesigners such as Stella McCartney and\nPaul Smith and by buying and wearing\none, you can express solidarity with\nyoung cancer patients.\nThere are many larger cancer charities\nthat do essential work, especially in\nresearch. But the TCC, in the words of\nMark Woods, one of only six people the\ncharity employs, \"makes a difference to\nyoung people right now.\" These wards\nhelp the patients find companionship with\ntheir peers and go a long way in overcoming many of the mental difficulties, which\nare often overlooked, of facing such devastating illness alone.\nYou can purchase the bandannas in\nmany shops including Selfridges and Top\nShop, and also in the Chaplaincy office in\nBeit East Basement.\nFor more information check out:\nhttp://www.bandanna week. com/\nor email:\ngillian.strain e@ ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "new fiction\nDistance\nTonight I hit my head on a piece of furniture that was hard and hurt myself. It was\nnot so much the hurt that mattered as the\nfact that no one was there who would\nhave seen the hurt and tried to make it\nbetter. There was my mother who was far\naway, and my father who was also far\naway; there was my love, whose words\nand face and habits I knew so well that I could hear and feel what he would say or\ndo if he had been here. Since he was not,\nI pretended that he was, and now there\nwas his voice in my ear scolding me in his\nfunny and gentle way for being so clumsy,\nsaying you should be careful, as well as\nhis hand patting the curve of my head to\ntake the pain away.\nIt is like this most of the time. Outside\nthe window is someone's back garden,\nand back gardens in South Kensington\nare like magic forests that have accidentally woken up in the middle of all these\nold, elegant brick buildings, so that looking out of the window is seeing something spectacular. By myself, the beauty\nof these trees sings a sad, sad song when\nthe branches sway as the wind comes\nblowing through them, but when I pretend that he is here, sitting on the windowsill without caring how far below the\nground is and looking out of the window\ntoo, the trees sing a love song of the cold\nmonths that are coming, because cold\nweather is an excuse to stay close to your\nlove.\nWhen I looked at the clock it was so late\nthat for him, half a world away, it would\nbe so early. Now he would be in the back\nseat of his father's car, head back and\neyes closed, staying asleep but coming\nawake, and the famous, terrible traffic of\nour home roads would be flowing around\nhim so that if you thought about it he\nwould be made so small in the midst of all\nthe iron and steel and rubber moving sin-g le minded in two directions parallel and\nopposite. On the highways you are only a person inside your car; to the highway\nthere is only the rush moving over it from\nseven to eight in the morning and then at\nfour to six in the evening, the hottest,\ngrimiest parts of the day. It is fun when\nyou are not the only person inside your\ncar, when friends drive friends and words\nfly and happiness happens as simply as\nthat.\nI don't know if he has that kind of happiness any more. I want to know, because\nthere is nothing worse than having him\nunhappy and not realising how bad it is\nfor him. In between us there are seven\nhours of time and thirteen hours of plane-flight, and it is hard to tell from a voice\nover the phone how someone is doing.\nYou miss all the clues that he drops when\nhe lowers his eyes to the floor, when his\nhead leans to one side, when he says\nsomething lightly but there is no smile so\nyou know what is wrong.\nAt night I sit down and try to write, or\ndraw, when I know I should be studying\ninstead, but the things I think about need\nto be translated to words and lines on\npaper, words and curves on an LCD screen, rather than words and pictures\nunsaid and untold that drift away as\nthough longing was a gas and expanded\nwhen heated and was lost to the cold air\noutside the window. The window moves\nup and down and the lock is too stiff to\nclose. If I lock it do you think my dreams\nwill be able to go out and join his dreams?\nWe cannot even dream at the same time;\nhe wakes up when I am going to bed, I wake up when he is travelling home\nagain, exhausted from those terrible\nthings called lectures and classes.\nMaybe my dream tonight will hang in\nthe air and take a full day to travel east to\nwhere he is so that it will cleverly arrive\njust as he is going to sleep. Maybe\ndreams are clever and can manage all this\ntime-twisting. Maybe if we can see each\nother in dreams it will not be so bad and\nwe will not grow so far apart and the\ndreams will come true if we are patient\nenough.\nAnd in the meantime, I love you.\nHousing Questions? \u2022 What does a tenancy agreement mean?\n\u2022 Can you move out early?\n\u2022 Do you need repairs to your flat?\n\u2022 What if you fall out with your housemates?\n\u2022 Do you need a TV licence?\n\u2022 Who has to pay for gas and electricity?\n\u2022 What is council tax?\n\u2022 What if your landlord keep bothering you?\n\u2022 Can your landlord keep your deposit when\nyou leave?\nNo Problem too Big or too Small!\n\n"

    "content": "in active\nThere I was at four in the\nmorning, yet again berating\nmyself for allocating two pages\nfor sport during this, the summer term, when obviously all\nstudents are inside all day,\nwhen suddenly, like an angel\nfrom Heaven, a freak shaft of\nlightning hit Felix towers, travelled down the mains line to\nmy computer, and by some\nmiracle allowed my computer\nto intercept an e mail that was\nbound for the BBC sports desk.\nSo here it is, hot from the press:\na report on the latest new\nsport to sweep the world.\nEnjoy! - Ed.\nWelcome one, and welcome\nall, to the exciting new world\nof sofa surfing. This sport sees\nteams of fat slobs vying for a chance to win the fabled\nGoblet Of Lard, as well as a Playstation, and a multi-pur-pose remote control.\nSofa Surfing\nThe game itself is like bingo,\nbut instead of numbers, one\nhas to collect words, chosen\nfrom the vocabulary of our fair\nlanguage by a panel of experts\nwho have nothing better to do.\nThe teams, each of three play-ers, then have five cable tele-visions, but only two remote\ncontrols, and they have to use\nwit, cunning, and team work\nto zap between various channels to collect the 'hot' words\nfrom the mindless ef flu en ce of\nwaffle that emanates from\ntheir goggle-boxes.\nHowever, all this must be\ndone while drinking Special\nBrew at the rate of a can every\nhalf hour, and eating crisps at\nthe rate of a jumbo bag of sea-salt kettle chips every twenty\nminutes, and obviously you\nmust never rise from your sofa,\nwhich clearly imposes a natural time limit.\nThe first professional match\never played was between the\nSuffolk Sloths and the\nGloucestershire Gluttons.\nThe match started well,\nwith both teams finding the\nword 'salubrious' in the same\nfive minutes, on two different\nchannels, thanks to the BBCs\nobsession with Jeremy\nPaxman. However the game\nwaned after that, and with\nonly 'gallant' missing from the\nGluttons bag, and 'musty'\nfrom the Sloths, a fight broke\nout between the Suffolk team\nwhen one member wanted to\nsee what happened at the end\nof Star Trek, and another\nspoiled it for him, informing\nhim that they went back in\ntime in a space hole to fix the\nproblem with super glue. The\nexcitement proved too much,\nand they forfeited through lack\nof bladder control.\nThe next match was\nbetween the London Louts\nand the Yorkshire Yobs, and\nthis game started well until\nyells of 'Northern Donkey' and\n'Southern Pansy' broke the\nconcentration of the referee,\nwho was trying to watch Neighbours, who promptly\ndisqualified everyone for preventing him finding out who\nToadfish was shagging.\nTherefore only one team\nwent through into the Grand\nFinal, and this was the\nGluttons. However, foolishly,\nand perhaps due to over-confidence( since you must complete the challenge to win,\nregardless of opposition), they\nstarted slow, enjoying a full\nepisode of the Good Life, and\nhad to admit defeat for sanitary reasons, while, ironically,\nstill searching for the word\n'chicken'.\nIC Athletics Needs YOU!\nULU Athletics Championships\nPARLIAMENT HILL TRACK Wednesday 5 June from 1pm Help Imperial defend the title they have won for the last\n4 years and show that we are still the best University\nAthletics Team in London\nAll levels required\nMale or Female\n(IC will be entering 3 Teams!)\nFor more info visit:\nwww.ul athletics. co.uk\nIf you are interested\nin competing e mail your\nName, Events and\nPersonal Bests to:\nsimon l. lewis@ic.ac.uk\nderek.mak@ic.ac.uk\nm peri al Presents the World cup\n\u2022 college *\nLIVE on the BIG SCREEN\nunion\nBARS\nFriday 31st May, France v Senegal 12.30pm Saturday 1st June,\nGermany v Saudi Arabia 12.30pm Sunday 2 nd June,\nBar 10.30am, no alcohol before 12pm England v Sweden 10.30am Spain v Slovenia 12.30pm Wednesday 5th June\nUSA v Portugal 10.00am Ireland v Germany 12.30pm Thursday 6th June\nCameroon v Saudi Arabia10.00 am France v Uruguay 12.30pm Friday 7th June bar 11.30am3 pm Spain v Paraguay 10.00am England v Argentina 12.30pm Bar open at 12pm unless stated.\n\n"

    "content": "lifestyle feature\n\"See Spot run.\nWho needs sentences anyway? Clarissa Saunders\n\"...communicating in real, grownup words is just a bit old-hat for\nthe digital age...\"\nLiteracy. For almost three centuries, this\nfairly arbitrary concept has been one of\nthe predominant signs of national prosperity and 'social evolution' (whatever\nthat may be). GDP average life expectancy and imperial might may come and go\nas symbols of power and prestige, but\nthe ability to read and write has been universally accepted\n(note that when I say\nuniversally, I obviously mean in\nWestern Europe and\nthe US) as a surefire\nstatistical sign of\n'progress' since the\nearly eighteenth century.90% of your population meets basic\nliteracy standards? Well then, you must\nbe a great and wonderful country, where\nthe streets are paved with gold and every\ntown is an Utopian idyll...\nWhich is all very nice, but what's it got\nto do with the price of fish? Well, it\nappears that that's all just too simple for\nenlightened twenty-first century think-ing. Communicating in real, grown-up,\nthree syllable (second letter f), words is\njust a bit old-hat for the digital age. We\nwant something shorter, less personal\nand altogether vaguer from our language\n- preferably available in orange and purple Ikea flat packs. Basically, it all boils\ndown to this - when was the last time\nyou sat down and actually wrote someone a real letter? Handwritten or typed, I don't mind, just as long as it involved a stamp, an envelope, a postbox and more\nthan a hundred words (there are 113\nwords in the first paragraph, so I don't think that's asking for very much). A month? A year? Never? But we don't need snail mail, you say - we've all got\nemail. It's newer, it's faster, it's free; ergo\nit's better. Maybe - but it's not the same.\nThe whole point of email is that it's supposed to be quick. It's definitely not supposed to suggest an agonising process of\ndrafts and redrafts, carefully selecting\nthe most poignant and meaningful words\nin order to honestly convey your feelings.\nYou're supposed to write slapdash\nEnglish, preferably with some suspect\nspelling and absolutely no regard for\ngrammar. And that's the form that our\nprimary form of non-verbal communication has now taken? As Darwin so\nfamously said, \"evolution's a funny old\ngame\".\nLet's try a different\nquestion: How would\nyou feel if you received\na real letter (Basildon\nBond and everything)\nfrom one of your\nfriends? From the bank,\nfine. From the RBS platinum card people, fine\n(I 've been pre-approved, you know). I'm even happy getting mail from the\nReaders bloody Digest. But from a friend?\nI'd be scared witless before I'd even\nopened the envelope. I mean, what kind\nof correspondence requires someone to\nactually write a letter? To sit down and\ncompose, to select their words, to construct and mould their sentences? To, in a word, write? Scary correspondence,\nthat's what. They're either (a) horrendously depressed (not good), (b) dying\n(worse), (c) in love\nwith you (very bad\nindeed), or (d) all three\n(...bugger). Basically,\nthis cannot be A Good\nThing.\nY 'see, we all want\nto be young, hip and\ngroovy (to paraphrase\nEddie Izzard), and thus we have to be\nseen to be footloose and fancy free (to\nparaphrase someone else... can't remember right now - might be Cole Porter). We\nmust not, under any circumstances,\nspend our time contemplating the meaning of existence, the nature of our feel-in gs, or the mental wellbeing of subsistence farmers in Azerbaijan. Unless\nyou're very, very drunk. Or Thom Yorke.\nOr a friend of mine called Ed. So (to cut a long story sideways), we can't spend\ntime writing letters. We can't let anyone\n\"...perhaps we're too clever, too medias awy and just a little\ntoo ironic...\"\nknow that we've spent the last month-and-a half trying to fathom the best way\nto tell them something. Even saying\nsomething serious or thought-out via the\nmedium of oral communication (that's talking and telephoning to you and me)\nare fairly heavily frowned upon. In fact,\nwe can't do anything but bounce electronic messages back and forth. We can't write in the style of Helen Fielding, let\nalone Fitzgerald or Hardy or whoever (I'm not going to suggest that anyone would\nwant to exchange pleasantries in the\nstyle of Shakespeare - even in the\nSixteenth Century that was pretty daft),\nso we email or (queue gasp of righteous\nindignation from assembled English professors of the world), we exchange text\nmessages.\nAnd( to finally get to the point that I was trying to make several hundred\nwords ago) we write complete tosh. Now,\nI know that's a very unfair thing to say.\nPerhaps you really do fill your Sent Items\nfolder with delightful, insightful, witty\nremarks on the state of the world today.\nPerhaps. And perhaps your friends eyes\nlight up every time they receive a text\nfrom you, in response to yet another cleverly constructed haiku\nthat combines a broad\nswipe at the state of\nneo-capitalist Western\nculture with an\ninstruction to meet\nyou in the Union Bar at\n7.30. Well, perhaps...\nBut (and, like all the\nbest buts, it's a big one), that's only the\ntip of the iceberg:\nHow about PowerPoint presentations,\ncorporate reports, and the whole,\nbenighted, bullet-point ridden world of\ncorporate Americana? There's not a proper sentence in sight - it's as if someone,\nsomewhere has decided that the people\nwho run the world are simply incapable\nof interpreting a few sentences on their\nown , and must only be fed grammar free\nstrings of short, punchy words. Perhaps\nthe implication is that we're too busy to\nfeature lifestyle\nRun, Spot, run\"\ninvestigates the sudden demise of the written word\nread anything that can't be summarised\nin a series of slides. Perhaps we're too\nclever, too media savvy and just a little\ntoo ironic (don't you\nchange tack for just a moment, let's back\ntrack a couple of centuries, to a little\ntown in 15th Century Bavaria where\nJohannes Gutenberg\nunless he or she\nabsolutely has to..\nthink) to be swayed \"...the user doesn't has just had a really\nby wordy de scrip clever idea. He's just\nt ions and careful j ux want to read anything invented the world'st a position. Or perhaps we just don't like long words -they're big, they're\nscary, they have\nthings hidden up their sleeves.\nHow about advertising? From newspapers and magazines, tubes and buses,\nbillboards and a million identical fly-posters, we're constantly under threat\nfrom written adverts - and what form do\nthey all take? A company name, a five\nword slogan, web address and a pretty\npicture. Even on the most impossibly vast\nhoarding or the most extravagant magazine ad, there's still no space explanation,\ndescription or anything more than the\nmost meagre wordplay - just big, bold\ntext telling you that it exists and that it's great. You'd be forgiven for thinking that\nit 'twas ever thus, but that's certainly not\ntrue - once upon a time, copy writing was\na skilled art form, performed by trained\nprofessionals operating without the safety net of funky graphics and expensive\nphotography. Once again, well-written\nwords (let alone sentences and para-graphs) have been ruled obsolete.\nFinally, how about the ways in which\n(we're taught) good web pages should be\nconstructed? The user won't scroll. The\nuser won't read long blocks of text. The\nuser needs bullets. The user won't respond to plain text. The user likes short\nwords. The user wants... The list of\ndesign dos and don'ts is a long one\nindeed, and would make the journalists\nof thirty or forty years ago spin in their\nG& Ts - because it all adds up to one simple thing: the user doesn't want to read\nanything unless he or she absolutely has\nto. The user, to put it bluntly, has a passionate dislike for the written word.\nOn that rather depressing note, let's first mechanical printing press, and,\ndespite the fact that,\nso far, he's only run off\na few hundred copies\nof a rather nicely illustrated version of the\nBible, Europe is very rapidly waking up\nto the fact that it's a shockingly good\nidea. So much so, in fact, that within a century his invention had begun to completely change the way in which\nEuropeans wrote and (eventually) the\nway in which they communicated, by\nallowing a whole new form of writing, the\nnovel, to exist (text can be non-linear,\ny 'see, whereas oral communication\nforces us to tell stories in a straight line...\nit's all very complicated and, quite\nfrankly, I really can't be bothered to go\ninto it right now). Perhaps the latest radical shift in the way we put words on\nrecord will produce a similarly radical\nshift in the way we write and, ultimately,\nthe way we think. History seems to teach\nus that the form of writing that best suits\nthe medium in question becomes, when\nthat medium reaches\nthe impossible-to-ignore, couldn't live-without-it, freely-avail-able in Gua da lahar a\"... we head down an inexorable road\nthink I know anyone who couldn't read\nAn Unbearable Likeness of Being or Love\nin the Time of Cholera, but what does\nthat mean - I'm certainly not sure that\nthey'd all understand them (they confused the hell out of me). Literacy really\nmeans a lot more than simply being able\nto read. And it also means a lot more than\nthe ability to construct complicated sentences and use $12 words ad nausea m. According to a standard definition, it's about the ability to function in modern\nsociety, and to understand, interpret and\nmanipulate all that you read and write -so is anything really changing here? After\nall, if we all change the way in which we\nread and write, what's the difference?\nLiteracy levels won't change - just the\nway in which they're tested, right?\nMaybe. But, as the norms of written\nEnglish (and French, German, Spanish\nand Italian, for that matter) dissolve, the\ntest becomes impossible to write.\nGlobalisation should protect us from a return to incompatible regional dialects\nand grammars, but the ability to convey\nthe last nuance of meaning and essence\nof thought may well slowly vanish, as we\nlose both the language (the nouns) and\nthe global referent s( the verbs and the\nadjectives) that that requires.\nSo is this really a bad thing? Well, it\ndestroys art; it destroys romance; it\ndestroys imagination. I'd say that's quite bad.\nNone of these can exist\nwithout the kind of writing - the kind of words -levels of saturation that towards the land of that these forms just\nemail and texting have don't encourage,\nnow achieved, the form Tubbyspeak...\" Without the ability to\nwrite down or interpret\nthat we are most fluent\nand adept with. And so, given a little\ntime, our ability to write anything else\n(and thus anything complex, passionate\nor inspirational) disappears into the void\nfrom whence it came.\nBut does this actually make society any\nless literate? Endless statistics will happily demonstrate that literacy is increasing year by year across the globe. I don't complex ideas and ideals, our language\nwill head down an inexorable road\ntowards the land of Tubbyspeak, and\nwe'll be left with a culture whose literature is fuelled by asides, pop culture ref-e rence s, curve ball tangents, a complete\ndisregard for the rules of English grammar and stacks of bad puns.\nNot entirely unlike this.\n\n"

Shame. (Page 8)\nHousing Concerns Deepen\nSenior College officials have told Felix\nthat the College has insufficient cash to\nfund the Southside refurbishment.\nNonetheless, Dr Chris Towler, the Director\nof Strategy, confirmed that the College\nstill intends to spend \u00a312.7 million on a new 'headquarters' building.\nFelix has also learned that the\nClayponds hall of residence will definitely\nbe sold, but only once alternative accommodation has been found near the South\nKensington campus. Clayponds currently\nhouses 332 students, most of whom are\noverseas postgraduates.\nAn interim balance sheet approved two\nweeks ago by the college Council shows\n\u00a330 million raised through the sale of student residences with only \u00a38 million\nbeing spent on residence refurbishment.\nAlthough the original justification for selling halls close to the South Kensington\nwas the need to fund Southside refurbish-ment, the money now seems to have been\ndiverted towards the new headquarters\nbuilding and the imminent Sports Hall\nredevelopment.\nSouthside: looking up?\nThe new Director of Estates, Mr BrooksWilson, is understood to be considering\nvarious options for the Southside refurbishment. Several Universities have\nalready gone down the private finance\nroute, either by selling off their assets to\ndevelopers and leasing them back, or by\nengaging a private management comp a ny. However, the enormous cost of the\nSouthside refurbishment makes it unlikely that any developer could make an\nacceptable profit over the life of the proposed contract.\nThe College might also turn the whole\ncomplex over to a housing association,\nwho would then be able to spend\nGovernment subsidies to bring the building back up to scratch. However, the hall\nwould still be controlled by College, and\nthe warden ing system maintained in its\npresent form.\nUnion officials, already angry at the\nlack of student consultation over the\nClayponds sale, were blunt in their\nassessment of the College hierarchy.\n\"They know where they want to eventually end up, but they don't seem to know\nhow to get there...\"\nDr Towler told Felix that \"we don't yet\nhave a College-wide strategy for residences... we're only part-way through a hugely iterative process.\" He also\nstressed College's long-term commitment\nto the provision of accommodation for first\nyear undergraduates and overseas postgraduate students.

    "content": "this week\nEditorial\nOh my God. That was like, the\nmost stressful diary ever. Last\nweek's was positively a dream compared to this one. I had to apply brain and everything for this one. Oh well.\nSo, what's been going on, I hear you ask. Well to start\nwith, those of you who read\nthe letters page may have\nnoticed that last week I said\nthat we weren't going to have\nanything more on the\nPalestine-Israel debate, as\nwell as no more on the NUS\ndebate. Strangely I 've had six\nor seven letters continuing\none, but not the other. I 'll let\nyou guess which. So to solve\nthe problem of representing\nstudent views without turning Felix into a private forum, I am going to be organising a debate between the various\ndifferent protagonists for\nsome time in the next few\nweeks before term ends. I will\nthen attend this debate (but\nnot mediate it: that will be\nsomeone else), and write it up\nas a feature for the final issue\nof term. I hope this provides a reasonable solution for every-one, especially me. Look out\nfor publicity over the next few\nweeks.\nApart from all this I have\nthe bloody Alternative\nProspectus to sort out, as well\nas a handbook, so anyone\nwho thinks this job is easy\ncan kindly come and take over\nfrom me before I have a nervous breakdown, and possible\na brain haemorrhage.\nRespect, incidentally, is due\nto all of you who have exams\nthis week, and all other\nweeks, for that matter. I was\njust trying to help a first year\nfriend of mine with her maths\nthe other day: I have done four\nyears of Physics, and I still\nhad absolutely no idea what\nwas going on, so I think that\neither the quality of degree\nhas gone up, or the quality of\nmy brain has gone down.\nEither way, I'm impressed.\nUm. Sex? Usually an interesting subject, but I'm afraid\nit's all been a bit quiet on that\nfront lately. I haven't fallen for\nanyone grossly unsuitable\n(except perhaps for a mild age\ngap) recently, and when I saw\nanother ex-girlfriend this\nweekend (because my life is\nthat exciting), it was all fairly\neasy and none too stressful,\nand we didn't even do anything stupid.\nSo on to pastures new, I suppose. Maybe I 'll find some\nway to spice up my life, but\nI'm not sure I can deal with\nany extra stress, so maybe I 'll\njust make the most of some\nme-time, as I think the\nAmericans say. That's not to\nsay that I'm not welcoming\nany advances, lad ieee es. Hehehe. Come up and see my\nsnake, etc. Oh arse, I can't be\nbothered. I'm going to bed. On\nmy own. Now.\nWhoops, forgot about the\nother four pages of Felix I 've\ngo to do first. So much for me\ntime.\nStart Here\nThis\nWeek\nFriday Weekend\nUnion\nEvents\n42\nDolly Mixtures\nYou're dancing on the\nfloor, when you see this\nbeautiful person eyeing\nyou up.
