As the numbers of skilled and\nhighly educated nationals increase\nin the rich ej countries, those in the\npoorer countries will decease; the\ngap between rich and poor countries\nwill continue to grow.\n2. The gap between the rich and\npoor in the poor countries themselves will continue to grow \u2014\ngovernments will not be able to\nafford to send as many poor students on scholarships while the\nsons and daughters of the small\nrich elite class in those countries\nwill still be able to afford the fees.\nThe Tory manifesto itself says\nthat the government intends to\n\" maintain the excellence of our\nhigher educational system\" and \"to\nhelp the poorer nations through\nnational and international programmes of aid\". The only way it\ncan hope to keep these promises is\nby allowing foreign and refugee\nstudents to study in Britain without\nimposing quotas of discriminatory\nfees.\nSmall Projects\nThe need to encourage development education within the UK student movement has long been a major concern of WU S. As a development agency working in the Third World, WU S has\nrecognised the need to increase understanding about global social, economic and politic i al relationships and conditions, particularly those which are responsible for under-development.\nAt WU S, development education is directly concerned with issues\nof human rights, dignity, self-reliance, and social justice in both\ndeveloped and developing countries. Through programmes for\ndevelopment education, WU S is attempting to encourage involvement and action for improvement, and to break down attitudes and misconceptions which exist within the student movement about the Third World. In order to encourage development education in colleges, WU S selects three Small Projects each year which lend themselves to\ncampaign work within the student movement. The projects are\nchosen because they represent the efforts of groups in Third\nWorld countries to provide educational facilities as a step towards\nself-determination.\nSoviet Prisoner's Defence\nTo Be Conducted In\nLondon\nImportant figures in the fight against\npsychiatric abuse in the USSR will\nappear in public at Central Hall,\nWestminster, at 2:30pm on Thursday\n15th May. The occasion consists of a public defence of Vyacheslav\nBakhim, conducted by Louis BlomCooper, QC, followed by a press\nconference and public meeting.\nMany people in the USSR are,\nbecause of their opinions, imprisoned in hospital and forcibly\ngiven unsuitable and harmful medical\ntreatment on the pretext that their\nunorthodox beliefs constitute\ninsanity. There is in Moscow a Working Commssion to investigate\nthe use of psychiatry for political\npurposes; not surprisingly its\nmembers are persecuted. Bakhim is\na founder member of the Working\nCommision who is now in prison.\nThe purpose of Thursday's meeting\nis to give him, albeit in his absence,\nthe public defence which he was\ndenied in his own country, and to\nstop the spreading acceptance of,\nand indifference to, the illegal\npractices of the Soviet authorities;\nfor the keeping alive of better\nstandards in the rest of the world is\nthe Soviet victims' only hope.\nAmong those giving evidence will\nbe General Pyotr Grigorenko, who\nwas stripped of his rank and honours\nand set to psychiatric hospital after\ncriticising Stlain; Vladimir Bukousky,\nexiled dissenter; a British and a Soviet psychiatrist; and a London\nbarrister, Brian Wrobel, who has\ntwice visited the Working Commission.

Charlotte Maxeke Residential\nCreche \u2014 Tanzania\nSince the early sixties, an ever\nincreasing number of black South\nAfricans have been leaving South\nAfrica, fleeing perse cu ation. The\npolitical turmoil in South Africa\nduring 1976 meant that even more\nSouth African blacks fled South\nAfrica and joined the already large\nSouth African exile population in\nother African countries.\nThe Charlotte Maxeke Residential\nCreche was opened in Junelast year,\nin the small Tanzanian town of\nMorogoro. The aims of the c rec he are many. It is essential that the\nchildren's intellectual, emotional and\ncultural needs are properly cared for.\nIt is equally important not only to help\nthe exiled mothers care for their\nchildren properly, but to allow them\nsufficient time to continue their own\neducation. There is also the need to\nintroduce the concept of child care\neducation to the black South African\ncommunity. It has always been a struggle for parents to provide for\ntheir children's material needs.\nParents have been able to give very\nlittle attention to their young children's intellectual and physical\ndevelopment.\nThis has had a particularly bad\neffect on slow learners and physically\nhandicapped children.\nThe successful operation of this\npilot project will do much to help\ndevelop the concept of child care\neducation, and perhaps lay the\nfoundation for proper care for preschool children in South Africa in the\nfuture.\nRight now, the c rec he needs much\nmaterial support if it is to achieve the\ngoals it has set for itself. A list of\nmaterials needed by the c rec he is\navailable from WU S(UK) who will fly\nout all the materials collected by\nparticipating groups to the c rec he. Djibouti Library Project\nIt would be surprising if Djibouti were\nwell known. It only came into\nexistence as an independent republic\nin 1977, after 117 years as a French\ncolony. Although independent, it is\nstill tied to France.\nIt is of a country without any\nindustry or agriculture, the education\nsystem is practically non-existent;\nonly eighteen Djibouti an s have\ncompleted a university education,\nand there are a mere dozen local\ndoctors and engineers, unemployment is above 50% and rising.\nSince 1977 there has, however,\nbeen a rapid influx of foreigners into\nDjibouti; not tourists but refugees.\nMost are students, some are\nEthiopians and others Eritreans.\nIn an attempt to alleviate their\nplight, to ensure that where and\nwhen their basic needs are met they\nare not condemned to a wasteful\nexistance with no opportunity to\ndevelop their mind, their potential,\nWUS(UK) is helping to establish a library.\nThere is a great need for English '\nlanguage publications (non-existent\nin French-speaking Djibouti); some\nperiodicals have already been sent.\nOnce immediate needs are being met\nit is hoped that provision may be\nextended into education assistance\nto the local population and the other\nrefugee groups in the country.\nEducational Reconstruction In\nNicaragua\nFollowing the overthrow of the\nSomoza dictatorship in July 1978,\nthe Government of National Reconstruction was faced with an enormous task, not only in terms of\nrepairing the physical damage\ninflicted on schools and other public\nbuildings by the Civil War, but also in\nthe need to provide such basic\nfacilities as education and health care\nfor the majority of the population.\nReconstruction of the health and\neducational sector, therefore,\ninvolves not just the rebuilding of\nschools and hospitals, but the\nlaunching of a campaign to wipe out\nilliteracy, the training of local health\nmonitors to teach basic hygiene and\nfirst aid, the installation of safe water\nsupplies and the construction of\nadequate housing.\nRather than choose one specific\nproject, WUS(UK) is encouraging\nlocal groups to support a series of\nreconstruction projects. While these\nprojects refer mainly to the physical\nreconstruction of damaged institutions, they are an integral part of the\nexpansion and reorganisation of the\nhealth and educational sectors to\nprovide basic fac i lites for the whole of\nthe population.\nThis year's Third World Scholarship Campaign has so far raised\n\u00a31200. The target figure is \u00a32000+.\nAnyone with a few minutes to\nspare on the afternoon of Wednesday 14th May is needed in the\nUnion Office to help WUS. If you\ncan not make this but are interested in WUS, contact Chris Fox\n(Union Office), Tim Hillyer (Maths\n3) or Mary Attenborough (Maths\nPG).\nThanks for your 5p. Chris Fox Tim Hillyer\n10\n\n"

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE STUDENT DEMO Dear Colin\nI wish to express my absolute\ndismay at the spectacle I saw last\n2nd week in Kensington Park. It seemed\nto me that a very substantial\nnumber of IC students found\nenjoyment in making an utter farce\nout of an important, and potentially\nvery volatile situation. Not only\nwere they putting over their views\nin a completely irrational and\ndisgraceful manner by jeering at\nIranian protesters, like some rioting\nschool kids, but they also succeeded\nin drawing the attention of the\nworld's media in the process.\nThere is no better way to damage the reputation of Imperial\nCollge, than to display ourselves in\nsuch a stupid, un civilised and\nignorant way.\nI am ashamed to belong to a College, where more people find it\npreferable to shout, jeer, and sing\ninane songs about the Iranian\nregime, than to bother attending\nUGMs to formulate official, democratic and realistic college policy.\nThe fact that the 'RCS piano' was\nalso present, does nothing to\nattempt to alleviate the problem,\nbut simply lowers those involved to\nthe level of their crit is ed Iranian\ncounterparts.\nVburs faithfully\nA Sickener), IC Student\nThe TIMES Friday May\nThe atmosphere near the Iranian Embassy at Princes Gate, Kensington changed yesterday from farce and near\ncarnival to moments of frightening nationalistic fer v our when\nrival groups of chanting demon--strat or s faced each other in the\nwarm spring sunshine while the\nhostages sat out the second day\nof their ordeal.\nA policeman' s ankle was broken and several arrests were\nmade when police separated two\ngroups of pro-Khomeini Iranians.\nFive policemen struggled to pin\ndown a frantic demonstrator\nwho lashed out with hands and\nfeet.\nThere were other arrests later\nwhen police eased a group of\nBritish and Americans away from more than 100 Iranians kept\nby the police in the park. The main group of about300 in Kensington Road were penned\nbetween ed lines of policemen.\nA banner saying \" Free the\nYanks\" was hung from a block of\nflats and a group of about 100\nBritains and Americans led by\nDear Colin\nAs students of this college we\nfeel obliged to condemn in the\nstrongest possible terms the action\nof various members of the Union\nduring the siege of the Iranian\nEmbassy last Thursday (1st May).\nTheir counter-demonstration\ncomplete with piano and community\nsinging would have been a great\nsuccess in the Union Bar, but in\nthe circumstances betrayed a complete indifference to the tragic\nevents going on in Iran and many\nother parts of the world and to the\nlives of those held hostage inside\nthe embassy. It has been claimed\nthat some of the policemen present\nappeared to be enjoying the perform-ance. These did not, however,\ninclude those with the overall\nresponsibility for the operation\nwhose task of bringing the siege to\na peaceful conclusion was not\nmade easier by the irresponsible\nattitude of the IC contingent. Their\naction could have led to a riot and\ntheir coverage on TV on Thursday\nevening very probably led to the\npresence of skinheads on the\nfollowing afternoon obviously out\nfor a 'bit of fun'.\nOn Friday afternoon a question\nwas asked in the House of Commons\nas to who these \"irresponsible\"\ncounter-demonstrators were who\nmade the task of the police harder.\nAre these really the type of\npeople who can be trusted to take\nup responsible posit on s in society\nin the near future?\nYours sincerely\nA Gujral\nA Nicolaou\nC Temple-Bird\nIan Hodgson\nKirsten Pratt\nJT Czernuszka\nstudents from Imperial College\nsang Rule Britannia and the\nBritish and American national\nanthems, and shouted\" Go home you bums\". The Iranians in\nthe park amid a crowd of several\nhundred people retorted by\nchanting pro-Khomeini and anti-American slogans.\nThe students brought a piano\nto lead the singing and a group of\ndrum beating,s a ff rb m robed Buddhists appeared, only to be\nshepherded by police away from\nthe main demonstration.\nThe GUARDIAN\nFriday May 2nd In mid-afternoon after a false\nreport that the British Embassy\nin Tehran had been occupied,\nstudents from Imperial College,\nwhich is near the Iranian embassy in Knightsbridge marched through Hyde Park\nchanting \" Khomeini out\", and\nalthough police moved to prevent trouble between the\nIranian students; and the counter demonstrators, there\nwere some scuffles.\nA policeman was injured and\nwas taken to St Stephen's Hospital, Fulham with a suspected fractured leg.\nIN THE NATIONAL PRESS\nThe DAILY MAIL\nFriday May 2nd There was an elderly lady of\namazing voice and astonishing\nvenom who bawled, 'Death to\nthe old bastard' as counter point\nto every chant of 'Khomeini!\nKhomeini!, and a drum-and-tambourine procession from a file of saffron-clad Buddhist\nmonks, suf fling past as much in\ntheir own world as a drunk who\ncame out of the bushes, sang\n' Maybe It's Because I'm a Londoner' ... and passed from\nour view.\nThen came more opposition\nstill, with the appearance of 100\nstudents from London University's Imperial College.\nTheir banners invited: ' Want to\ndie for Khomeini: Then drop\ndead.'\nThey gave us Jerusalem, Rule\nBritannia ...

They also infuriated the\nrapidly dwindling Khomeini followers by humming the\nAmerican national anthem.\nDear Colin That South Africa (SA) already has a nuclear arsenal is disturbing, but the fact\nthat Imperial College might be responsible\nfor helping them to develop more horrifying terror weapons is unacceptable.\nThe growing development of S A's nuclear\ntechnology has sufficiently worried United\nStates authorities enough for two South African nuclear scientists to be asked to\nleave the US and this must point to the\ngravity of the situation.\nSouthern Africa is a de stabilised area\ncontained a racist nation (SA), yet if you\nread the Johannesburg press; full page\nadverts leap from the print, offering you the\n- BOMBS FOR THE BOYS?chance of an industrial sponsorship to take\nyou to IC where you will learn how to make\nfuel for South African bombs ( Che mEng Msc in Nuclear Technology).

    "content": "CRICKET CLUB BOAT CLUB\nThe match between IC thirds and\nSouth Stan more CC proved to be a fitting foil for the drama of the siege\nnear College \u2014 it was extremely\nboring. Phil Maguire was captain, in\nthe absence of anyone else who could\ntoss a coin, and he duly 'allowed'\nSouth Stanmore to elect to bat (thus\nensuring a match of reasonable\nlength).\nAt forty-two for two (with two\nbatsmen in, who were obviously\nstudents of the Royal College of -Agriculture), a final total of one\nhundred seemed likely, and this\nlooked within reach; however, a furious spell of leg-side thrashing\nadded forty runs in only three overs\nand, thus de moral is ed Maguire's Magicians could not hold back the \u2022\nflood of runs, taking only four more\nwickets.\nAt tea, South Stanmore declared\nsetting the slightly unlikely target of\n172 runs to win in an hour plus twenty\novers.\nThe features of the IC fielding were\nthe unexpected sharpness, in the\noutfield and pati cula rly at slip Stean\ntaking two catches) and the fine\nbowling of Redmond, whose scything\nleg-cutters accounted for three of the\nsix dismissals.\nWhen IC replied, the emphasis was\nHANG GLIDING\nOn the third and fourth of May, two\nteams from IC took part in the first\nBritish Inter-University Hang Gliding\nCompetition, flown in South Wales\nand organised by Marc Asquith of\nSwansea University. Teams from\nSwansea, Loughborough and Aberystwyth took part.\nSix of us, Dave Bird, Chris Golding,\nBruce Goldsmith, Ian Hodkinson,\nDenis Howe and Paul Lanchester set\noff on Friday lunchtime for Marc's house, where we and about twenty\nothers were to stay! After meeting the\nopposition/sus sing out the local\npub/ crashing out, we awoke on\nSaturday to find the wind 'blowing a Haslie' and in the worst possible\ndirection. However, after several cups\nof coffee it had moderated enough for\na training slope to be used. Upon\narrival the conditions were ey il, but an\nopen task was run during which\npeople who took part felt that the\nobject was surviving, not flying. At\nleast one pilot flew to within one foot\nof the ground in an effort to achieve\nthe task.\nAs our teams were composed of\nnovices only, we had to wait for\nconditions to improve, which they did\nby about three thirty, after a second\nopen task. The first novice task was a distance/accuracy task with points for\ndistance flown along a line and also\non defence, but when Croft and then\nTurner departed, eleven for two was\nthe sorry state. Forshaw held up one\nend admirably and Maguire made a solid twenty.\nHowever, any action these four had\nsup lied was soon forgotten as Hewkin\nand Redmond batted for sixteen overs\nwhile adding just thirty runs. Redmond\ndeparting for eleven, Hewkin and\nStean then batted for another five\novers adding about thirty more runs\nmainly with inside edges and hoi ck s through the gaps in the eight man\nfielding side (only noticed after the\nmatch!).\nIC reached a semi-respectable 85\nfor 6 at the close and thus drew with a rather annoyed Stanmore side.\nBut the following Saturday's match\nwas quite indescribable \u2014 suffice it to\nrecord (for someone's posterity) the\nscores, Brondesbury 223 for 8 wickets,\nIC III 51 all out (and this included six\nducks from only ten 'batsmen').\nIt might be interesting to note that\nthe thirds had ten men despite Salter\nallowing us to leave college with only\neight \u2014 we physicists have hidden\ntalents.\nThe Thirds Team Captain For A Day\nPS: Thanks to Quentin, Neil and Andy\nfor playing at such short (ie, hours\nand minutes) notice.\nhow close to the line you were when\nyou landed. The task was complicated\nby the wind being a little strong and at\nan angle to the hill. Unfortunately,\nduring this task one of our pilots\ncrashed a club glider putting both it\nand himself out of action until Sunday.\nHe was not badly hurt, suffering only\na bruised foot and pride.\nBruce flew next for IC on his glider,\nand as it was only his third flight on it,\nput up a reasonable score. I was the\nlast IC member to fly and on an\nunfamiliar glider was only about\nhalfway up the score sheet.\nThe task was then run a second time\nas the conditions had improved even\nmore and this time both Bruce and I were placed near the top. Free flying\nwas then declared for the rest of the\nday.\nNext morning after a party the night\nbefore and about forty people sleeping\nin Marc's house we staggered off to a700ft high hill to find the wind gusting\nto between 38 and 40mph and so the\nrest of the competition was blown out.\nAfter working out the results, I was\nthird and Bruce fifth in the novices\nsection. Unfortunately we didn't have\nenough flyers to qua lift y for the team\ntrophy which was won by Swansea. I would like to thank the whole team\nand commiserate with those unable to\nfly and hope that next year we\nimprove upon a very creditable start to\ncompetitive flying.\nChris Golding\nAt Putney, the Men's Novice IV\nraced against King's College in the\nfirst round, and found they could not\nmatch the experience of half the\nKing's first VIII, losing by about two\nlengths. In the Novice Sculls event.\nAlistair Rowe, who was competing in\nhis first sculling race, had a hard row\nin the first round, eventually beating\nhis Auriol RC opponent by one length.\nIn the semi-final he had a comfortable\nwin over a London RC scull er, bu\nthen his lack of experience in i sculling boat showed when he lost his\nfinal to a very powerful scull er fr or c Kingston RC. In the Senior C VIII'!\nevent, the second VIII had a hard, but\ncomfortable row to win the heat. In\ntheir semi-final an easy win over\nNational Westminster Bank RC put\nthem in the final against Emanuel\nSchool. The schoolboy crew took ar\nearly lead of about a quarter length in\nthe final, but could not get away from\nthe IC VIII. However, a sustained burst\nby Emanuel at about the halfway\npoint saw them increase their lead to\nthree quarters of a length and the--eventually won by one length.\nMeanwhile, up at Barnes, the Ladies\nVIII had a comfortable semi-final win\nto put them in the final. In this race\nthey had to race Weybridge RC, a very\npowerful Ladies Club. However, the IC\nVIII gradually drew away from them\nand eased off towards the finish line,\nwinning by about three lengths, thus\nrecording the first win at an open\nevent by an IC crew this year.\nOn Monday, the Men's first and\nsecond VIII were at Thorpe Park, near\nStaines, competing in the Metropolitan\nRegatta \u2014 one of the oldest regattas\nin the calendar, and claimed by its\norganisers to the second only to\nHenley Royal. The racing was held on\na four-lane course, and so the crews\nonly had to finish in second place ir\ntheir heats to qualify for the next\nround. The second VIII, again competing in the serious ' C event once\nmore managed to qualify for the final.\nIn the final they were up against\nKing's School Canterbury, along with\nStaines RC and St Paul's School who\nthey had already beaten. As in the\nsemi-final, St Paul's took an early\nlead, but it then became apparent that\nthey had settled for only second place\nin the semi, and they gradually drew\naway from the IC crew. In the clos inc stages of the race, with St Paul?\nabout one and a quarter lengths ;\nfront, the Canterbury schoolboys jus\nrowed through IC, leaving the seco nc VIII in third place, having lost the\nsecond final in three days.\nThe first VII competing in thi\nserious 'A' event had somewhat of ar\neasier time, having a straight fina\nagainst AuriOl RC and Barclays Bam\nRC. Off the start, the IC VIII took ar\nearly lead, only to let Auriol come\nback at them. A late spurt by the IC\nVIII saw them draw away again, to win\nthe is pre sig io us event by two thirds o a length.\n17\n\n"

In this article the work is sum-maris ed. Refugees\nThe extent of refugee problems in the world today is enormous. The United States High Commissioner for Refugees estimated\nthat the world-wide increase in the number of refugees in 1978'\naveraged over 2,000 per day. In Africa there are about four million -refugees (one million from Southern Africa); over half a million' refugees are known to be in Europe and145,000 in LatinAmerica. Global figures for Asia differ enormously, but a quarter\nof a million people from Vietnam arrived by boat on the shores of\ncountries in South East Asia in 1978 and the first half of 1979.\nThe search for durable solutions\nto these problems continues and it\nis quite obvious that by providing\neducation in Britain for refugee\nstudents we are only helping a tiny number. However, liberal\nasylum policies by the industrialised\nnations and the provision of\neducation for those refugees taken\nin has to be a part of the attempt\nto find an overall solution. There\nmust be recognition of the role that\nrefugee students can play in the\ndevelopment either of their own\ncountries when they can return\nhome, or to other countries in the\nsame region. Providing education in\nthe industrialised countries is one\nway in which this role can be\nrecognised. It is therefore important\nthat aid policy should not only help\nprovide education but also enable\nthose who have finished their\neducation to use their skills in the\npoorer countries.\nThere is a particular problem for\nrefugee students. Although there is\nHigher Fees \u2014 Who Can Pay?\nSpecialised education in Britain has been available to thousands\nof students from the under-developed countries. It is true that\nuntil recently, little attention has been paid to the types and the\nrelevance of courses to the poor countries and their problems.\nBut the dialogue on the appropriateness of courses and training in\nthe last few years was initiated because there were students from\nthese countries in Britain.\nAt present it seems that there is no change in the number of\noverseas students coming to study in the United Kingdom but\nthere has been a change in the kinds of countries from which these students come. a potential for them to contribute\nto development it must be appreciated that by the very nature of\ntheir situation putting this into\npractise is rather more difficult\nthan for the average overseas student. It is therefore essential\nthat one should not only recognise\nthe similarities in some respects\nbetween overseas and refugee\nstudents but also appreciate the\ndifferences.\nRefugees who come to the UK to study will not be able to pick the\ntime or place to work after studying\nas most overseas students can. As an\nintegral part therefore of being\ngiven asylum in the UK and being\nrecognised as refugees they should\nalso be treated as British citizens\nfor educational and other purposes.\nIn addition therefore to a campaign\nagainst differential fees for overseas\nstudents, campaign work should also\ndemand the treatment of refugee\nstudents as home students.\nAt present 68.4% of all overseas\nstudents studying in the UK come\nfrom eighteen countries: the majority of these countries are not\namong those listed by the UN as\nthe Least Developed Countries, ie\nthe poorest.\nThe trend since 1975 is that\nfewer students have come from the\npoorest countries and more from\nthe less poor.

    "content": "WRITING\nIN FELIX?\nJust a Prcssypiccc!\nSo now the excitement of international\nterrorism has died down and everyone\ncan return to their daily chores. I would\nlike to say that I thought a number of IC students exacerbated what was already a volatile situation by their rather immature\nactions outside the Embassy.\nRents\nThe second round of discussions on rent\nlevels for next year occurred on the Student Residence Committee, any decision was referred to a future, unscheduled, meeting after the discussion\nhad ranged through the various extremes.\nThe basic proposal from College Finance\nsection is that rents be increased by an overall figure of about40%, putting Southside Hall rooms up to \u00a320.50, but\nsetting a triple in a Student House at \u00a310.\nBy revising the figures presented at the\nFinance Sub-committee and introducing\neconomies in various areas it was possible\nto counter propose an increase of 30%;\nSouthside room \u00a319.20, Triple Room \u00a39.00. ( This does h ve to taken in the context of the fact that increases last\nDecember were avoided and replaced by\none-off economies in decorating). Nevertheless, 30% is a very high percentage when\ncompared with a14.9% grant increase.\nFurther reductions in the increase were\npressed for but can only be obtained by\nreconsidering the Evelyn Gardens Lease\nrepayments which is why the meeting has\nreferred the matter back.\nWardens' Places And Re-Apps\nThe same Student Residence Committee decided to recommend that the right of\nWarden's Places be not included in future\nHall Warden contracts. It also decided to\nreduce the number of re-apps for the year\n1981-2 to a set figure for each Hall/ House giving a total of about 7% for the whole of\nCollege residence. These were both proposed by the Union reps in an attempt\nto increase the number of students who spend one year in a Hall/ House. Meanwhile . . .\nIam currently in negotiation with St Stephen's Hospital Physiotherapy Department, the Sports Medicine Foundation,\nand the Health Centre, with a view to\nsetting up a Sports and Orthopaedic injury clinic at College next year.\nI brought up the point on Bored of\nStudies that students who live in Weeks and Garden have suffered serious interference in the revision over the last\nweek and those who are currently involved in exams should have the events\nat the Embassy taken into into account\nwhen considering the results.\nThe last minute transfer of the Fete\ninto the College complex certainly changed the atmosphere of the event but\nthe profitability seems not to have been\naffected. Well done everyone who worked hard to make it a success and thanks to\nthe College staff who endured the change\nof venue.\nWork hard, keep your nose clean, and wash your hands.\nTally Ho! CHRIS Wardenship Of Hamlet\nAnd Cambridge Gardens\nThe successful candidate will be a postgraduate, preferably married,\nand likely to stay at IC for another\ntwo years.\nA flat is provided for the Warden,\nrent free, and he/she will receive an\nentertainments allowance.\nThe position will become vacant\nfrom the middle of September1980. Application forms are available\nfrom the Union Office, and the\nResidence Office, Room161, Sherfield Building, and the closing\ndate for applications is Friday\n23rd May.\nShare-A Fare: The response to the advert was so\ndismal that if you want or can\noffer a lift to College, please\ndrop a line to Room 6M19 Huxley.

    "content": "Editorial\nThose of us who witnessed the triumph of\nthe S AS at the Iranian Embassy have had\nthe good fortune to have seen a Great\nBritish success.\nThe demonstration by IC students outside the Albert Hall could have turned\ninto a disaster for the reputation of\nImperial. We were lucky to have the\npress on our side. They understood that\nwe were only having a bit of fun. However, I felt uneasy watching the\ndemo, but it did give the press something\nto photograph and took the steam out of\nthe Iranian student demonstration. I spent\nalong night with the Iranians on the\nevening of the siege and I did try to\nunderstand their views.\nIn an appeal to the British people they\nsaid:\n\" We are staging a gathering outside\nthe Embassy of the Republic of Iran to\nshow our solidarity with the captives\ninside the Embassy and to express our\nreadiness to be exchanged with the\nIranian and non-Iranian hostages and\nSALE\nOF\nSPORTS\nEQUIPMENT\nin the\nJ. C.R. on\nWed, Thurs, Fri,\n14, 15, and 16 May\nSquash Rackets\nInternational Model, \u00a35.90;\nSlazenger Whippet, \u00a38.90; Grays\nDouble Blue, \u00a37.90; Le Coq Sportif, \u00a36.90; Slazenger Challenge\n(DL) (Hand Made), \u00a315.90, With\nGut, \u00a319.99.\nClothing And Footwear:\nFread Perry Tracksuits, \u00a311.90,\nTraining Shoes, \u00a37.90; Go la Training Shoes from \u00a35.90;\nSquash Shorts from \u00a34.30, Shirts\nfrom \u00a34.60.\nTennis Rackets:\nDunlop Mayply Fort, \u00a317.90;\nDunlop Volley I, \u00a317.90; Dunlop\nVolley II, \u00a317.90; Grays Match1\nmaker ( HandMade Champ Gut), \u00a317.90; Black Diamond,\n\u00a37.90; Dunlop Club, \u00a38.50; Slaz\nFirepower, \u00a38.50; Slaz Sting,\n\u00a38.50 Wisden Rackets, \u00a37.90.\nalso to protest against the lack of\nprotection offered to the Iranian Embassy while the British Embassy in\nIran is being fully protected by the\nIranian authorities.\nWe have been surrounded by the\nPolice and have been kept in isolation\nfrom our other compatriots.\nThe Police have told us that our\nstay here is legal. Inspite of our legal\nstatus, the Police have refused food\nand drink to be given to us and toilet\nhas also been refused.\nThe impression is given through the media that we have been confronting the British Police. We vigour ou sly deny this and state that we are here\nfor peaceful purposes and our mess ge is:\n1. We express our support of Imam\nKhomeini and our solidarity with the\nIranian and non-Iranian hostages kept\nin our Embassy.\n2. We express our protest against\nthe British authorities for not having\nprovided adequate protection for our\nembassy in the first instance while the\nBritish Embassy in Tehran has always\nenjoyed full protection provided by the\nIranian authorities.\n3. We express our willingness to be\nexchanged with the Iranian and non-Iranian hostages kept in our Embassy.\nThe siege has left us with many memories and for some lucky photographers images of the siege have been\nrecorded on film. Students with good pictures have had various degrees of\nsuccess with magazines and newspapers.\nSeveral have had their films scratched\nand it would be useful if I could give\ngeneral advice to people with exclusive\npictures of the siege and future events.\nHowever, a lot depends on the circumstances. National papers do not want colour film because it takes a long time to\ndevelop. It seems that going to an agency\nsuch as the Press Association is a good bet.\nA student photographer who took his\nundeveloped black and white film to the\nSun was given back a very badly scratched\nset of negatives after the Sun had taken\ntwo good prints of the film. It may be\ncoincidence but several other incidents\nimply that there is a trend. Papers wishing\nto have exclusive photos arrange for the\nfilm to be scratched so that no one else\nwill be able to use it.\nIf you do take colour pictures there is\nstill a market if you sell to the colour\nglossy magazines such as Time, Now,\nNewsweek and other Sunday magazines.\nYou must move fast. If you have pictures\nof the siege and haven't started negotiations then you' re probably too late.\nHowever, I hope to be seeing the Editor\nof Impact magazine today, so if you have\nany pic s worth putting in an international\nmag then come to the FELIX Office as\nsoon as possible.\nIronically, the Editor of Impact was a hostage in the Iranian Embassy siege and\nI hope to print an interview with him in\nnext Friday's FELIX. Apart from J ez going to Brighton, a successful Rag Fete and the resolution to\nthe siege, etc, etc, a lot has happened to\ndistract the IC student from his/her hard\nstruggle to pass exams. Don't forget the\nRCS AGM next Tuesday or if you're in\nGuilds their handover on the steps of the\nAlbert Hall is on the same day.\nRae has thanked everyone who helped\nwith the Rag Fete and I would like to\ncongratulate her on the success of the\nFete. I met an exhausted Rae walking\nback after the event and she seemed pleased with the response. The Barbeque\nprovided me with a welcome meal and I wish we could have them more often\nbecause it is a good time to meet people\noutside one's usual group of friends.\nThe Red Cross have been collecting all\nweek at IC and a license has been obtained for tomorrow's street collection.\nCome to the Union Lower Lounge between 9:30 and 10:30 to collect your\ncan and license. You never know when\nyou might need the Red Cross... as I found out last February. Their ambulance\nrushed me to St Stephen's Hospital and a Red Cross wheelchair helped me get\nabout. This week a splintered cue in the\nUnion Lower Lounge meant that a pool\nplayer needed swift hospital attention and\nthe Red Cross were able to help.\nThis week FELIX asks donations for\nWU S. If you have given some of your\ngrant to WU S then I thank you. For most\nof us the Third World and refugee problems are more than at a distance\nfrom our comfortable way of life. However,\nseveral students have given up their time\nto help collect your five pence s for this\nFELIX and Iam grateful for their help. If\nyou would like to know more about WU S then turn to page nine.\nNext Thursday,170 Queens Gate opens its doors for another Beer'n 'Bangers.\nThe event is worth attending and if you\nwant to go, see Jen by 13th May. On Wednesday IC may suffer from a lack of\nactivity during the TUC Day of Action. The day should have been named the\nDay of Inaction, but that's been said so\nmany times before I should apologise for\nwriting it here. The day will be a forced\nholiday for many people as London Transport will be at a standstill. I wonder\nif TV will be cut? It will be interesting to\nsee how things work out.\nNews is scarce during the May \u2014 June period so if you know of anything happening please drop into the office or\ngive us a buzz on Internal 2881.\nI almost forgot to wish RCS success in\nthe Ten Tors this weekend.\nThanks to everyone who has helped a rather tired FELIX Editor this week. If\nyou'd like a rest from exam revision, why\nnot write an amusing article for FELIX. If\nyou've got any good pictures that sum up\nthis year at I CI'd like to see them because a FELIX review of the year will\nbe put together over the next few weeks.\nCheers\nColin Palmer\nFELIX Editor\nFELIX is published by the Editor, on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board.\" FELIX is printed on the Union premises in Prince Consort Road, London SW7.

    "content": "JUST ASEC CITY AND GUILDS After an enforced absence due to examinations beyond my control I have\nreturned to inflict more articles on you.\nThe Rag Fet eon Saturday was a success despite being moved to the Queens Lawn, with Guilds taking \u00a3120 for\nRag with our stalls. The Hit Squad made\nyet another return and managed to get\nmost of the people there.

    "content": "FELIX\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION Friday 9th May, 1980 Issue No.552 QUESTIONS ASKED IN\nCOMMONS AFTER IC DEMO\nFollowing the demonstrations\nby Imperial College students last\nweek there has been much\ncomment in the National Press\nand questions have been asked in\nthe House of Commons.\nMr John Page, the Conservative MP for Harrow West,\nasked \"Who are these pro and\nanti Ayatolla demonstrators who\nare upsetting local residents and\ngenerally turning the area into a beer garden?\nAre they students? Are they\nattending to their studies? Who\nis paying for them if they are\nstudents?\"\nJEZ\nLetters and what the papers said: page 2, The\npresident of ICU comments: page 5,\nEditorial: page 12\nJezebel, the motorised mascot\nof the Royal College of Science\nUnion, has had a very busy\nbank holiday weekend. The highlight was undoubtedly her\nsuccessful and trouble free arrival on Brighton's seafront\nafter partaking in the nineteenth\nannual Historic Commercial Vehicle Club's run to Brighton.\nThe day started at the un earthly hour of 4:00am. Two hours later, Jezebel was sitting\noutside Southside, whilst her crew ate their fill of the breakfast\nbeing served in the R CSU Office.\n(Many thanks are due to Rae Snee and her willing band of\nhelpers). J ez then moved on to\nBattersea Park, the start of the\nrun.\nAt her appointed hour, J ez moved off followed closely by a strange looking vehicle, apparently called Bo, which had come along to wish her well. The run to the halfway halt at Crawley was peaceful, with a surprising number of spectators\nconsidering the hour!\nAfter leaving Crawley, the spectators and traffic thickened\nup. Things continued smoothly,\nand the arrival on the seafront\nwas greeted by the PA announcement\" And now the rowdy bunch are here.

The College trade unions\nare hoping to organise a meeting in\nCollege at 11:30 on the Wednesday\nfollowed by a march to Central Hall,\nWestminster.\nThe effect of the transport strike is\nlikely to be that many College ser vies( eg, refectories) will not be able to\noperate as normal, and it is hoped\nthat departments will make every\neffort to rearrange lectures since\nmany students will be unable to at end many students will be unable to\nattend College that day.\nFor any students who must be in\nCollege on Wednesday (eg, due to\nongoing practical work) and who are\nunable to arrange an alternative to\npublic transport, the Union will be\nproviding camp beds in the I CW A Lounge on Tuesday and Wednesday\nevenings.\nPlease donate\n5p to WUS\nfor this issue\nof FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "The tense, heated atmosphere which pervades the current Iranian-American\nconflagration of interests has received\nexhaustive coverage in the media, as\nshould be the case. And what with the\npresent sei ge of Iran's London Embassy,\nwe in England can now smell the smouldering fumes of this prolonged dispute with our own nostrils. However,\nthe overall emphasis in the press has\nbeen one-sided. The general tone of these\nmultifarious reports, when they have\nventured from the purely fact u a i, has\nexpressed three things; outrage, at the\n'barbaric' behaviour of the Iranian people;\nbewilderment, in the face of what to many\noccidentals is an entirely alien culture;\nand anxiety, at the frightening possibilities\ngermane in the dispute.\n\u2014 \u2014 Concern\nThe last point will not concern us here,\nthough of course it is of the greatest\nconcern to all, precisely because, as\nindividuals, we are impotent to resolve it.\nThe American-Iranian Conflict:\n\u2014Some Historical Perspectives \u2014\nFacets\nThe general reaction of the Western\nmedia, then, has stressed these elements\nof outrage and bewilderment, but has not\neven attempted to balance its notoriously'\nbiased coverage by endeavour ing to\nunderstand the heritage, culture, history\nand religion of the Iranian people. To give\na detailed description of these facets of a people whose culture is as rich as any\nEuropean nation far exceeds the scope of\nthis abbreviated account, in which I intend to raise just a few key points.\nThese will, I hope, explain in part or in\nfull the origins of the astonishment and\nindignation with which Western man has\nperceived the present turbulence in Iran.\nSandstorm\nFirstly, it seems tome that the apparently anarchic nature of the revolution in Iran has blown up a swirling\nsandstorm of riots and marches which\nhas hidden the extraordinary atavism that\nhas occurred there: namely, the fusion of\nChurch and State. The pattern of an\nunchanging community with priests at its\nhead is the oldest of the great cultural\nproducts of Asia. The sudden resurgence\nof this phenomenon has, from the Western viewpoint, merely complicated a political situ t ation that is as slippery as\nbutter. The statesmen of Europe and America are usually men who have grasped the reins of power from the\nstreet, or more traditionally, from the\ndrawing room. In stark contrast, in Iran,\nthe Grand Ayatollah Khomeini steers both the ship of state, and the vehicle of\nreligion, Mohammed is m. Such a position\nof power has not been seen in Europe\nsince the declension of the Papal Empire.\nReligion then, with its accoutrements of\nmorals and mores, is clearly a protagonist\nin this fascinating episode in world history. For not only are the nations of\nIran and America vying against one another, but, as I will go on to show, the\nentire Weltanschauungs (world-views) of\nthese people are in op postion; and where\nthere is conflict, there is friction and fire.\nCentral to an understanding of the\npeople of Islam (which incidentally means\nGod) is their genealogy. This stems from the\nSandskirt word 'ayr a'( to which the words\nAryan and Iran correspond) which means\n'noble'. The Aryans originally inhabited\nparts of present day India, but some migrated westwards, where they settled in\nand around Iran, and later in parts of\nnorthern Europe.\nNow, a popular misconception is to\nassociate the 'aryan' with 'master', when a more appropriate epithet is 'masculine'. It\nis here that we see the connection between the Aryan and Mohammed is m, which, must rank as the chau van is tic religion par excellence. Yet there is a final\nlink in the chain, for we cannot but now\nfail to correlate Mohammed is m with that\nother patriarch i al religion, Semitism. The resemblances between these two need\nno further clarification other than a reading of the Old Testament and the\nKoran. Both stress the commandment of\nobedience, of resignation before God, and the importance of worship, prayer and fasting.\nGloating\nThe Draconian laws, which, for example, demand the execution of the\noffender on many counts, are merely\nanother facet of the Aryan-Muslim-OldTestament morality which permeates the\nIranian way of life. From the Western\nperspective, conditioned as we are by the\nso-called motives of civilisation and the\nChristian, New Testament doctrine of\nmercy and forgiveness, the harsh brutality\nof these punishments are offensive in principle and pr act ce. In the same way, it\nis now appropriate that Church and state\nare once again united under a single\nbanner, for, as in many Muslim countries,\nthe covenant of Mohammed is vigorously\nupheld by the law of the land. For example, it is often the case that if a man violates the edict of daylight fasting\ndecreed during the Muslim religious\nfestival of Ramadan, the offence is\npunishable by law.\nToday, then, we see the Iranians courageously refusing to be intimidated\nby America and Russia, the Atlas and\nHercules of the world; we see them threatening to ' try and execute'( as\napposite phrase which crystal lise s the\nabsolute ness of their stand) Iranian political prisoners if any member of their\nLondon Embassy delegation is murdered;\nand we see them gloating like children\nover the ignominious failure of the American mis enter pi ise to free their\nhostages. And it is more coincidental that\nthe Germans have a word for this kind of\nmalicious enjoyment of others' misfortune ..\n. . . it is 'sch aden freude', or literally 'joy in\nharm'.\n\u2014\u2014 Scourge \u2014 \u2014\nNevertheless, before I end, I would\ndraw your attention to another prominent\nfeature of this crisis which can be seen\nfrom a historical perspective. And it is\nhere that we at last find a common element. For it is clear that both . the\nAmerican and Iranian people have reacted in the same irrational way toward\ntheir 'opponents'. In America, there is a collective hatred and derision of the\nIranian people, an d,Id are say, the reverse\nis equally true. Yet, historically, both\ncountries are susceptible to this kind of\ncollective em n it y. In the 1950s, we saw\nevery 'true' American citizen respond to\nMcCarthy' s call to rid the country of the\nscourge of Communism, while recently, in\nIran, there has been the same kind of\nderanged collective hatred directed towards the Dynastic ruling class, personified by the ex-Shah. But it is a noticeable trait of people with Aryan blood in their veins that they are particularly prone to this unanimity of\nconsciousness, for just fifty years ago, the\nNazis were the hunters, the Jews the\nwitches.\nNo panacea\nThus, the dispute between these two\nnations is now no longer merely a political\nquarrel, nor is it simply a matter of\na tyrannical Shah and two score and ten\nhostages; it has escalated into a bitter\nconflict between value-systems, moralities\nand religions. There would seem to be no\npanacea to a dire crisis such as this,\nwhere both parties feel a gg rei ved and wronged, and subsequently sense the\nscales of justice to be tilted in their\ndirection. This seems to be particularly\ntrue here because, as I have clarified in\nthe a foregoing, there is no common cultural or religious nexus between the\ntwo peoples; as a result, there exists no\nsingle impartial, higher power to which\nthese warring peoples could present their\nrespective grievances.\nWe must look beyond manmade institutions or the framework of\ninternational law for the eventual resolution to this crisis; ultimately, there\nis always one unbreakable bond that\ntranscends all differences of belief, and beneath which every individual, every\nnation, is knit into a single family . . .\nnamely homo sapiens. It is the universal\nlove of mankind, the philadelphia n instinct, that can and must dissolve all\nbarriers between Caucasian, Mongolian,\nSlav, Indian, Negro and Aborigine.\nJustin Newland\n8\n\n"
