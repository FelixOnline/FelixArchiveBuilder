There will be a display of Wellsiana, a dinner, two evenings of\nfilms and also an exhibition made up of entries from IC Union members.\nThe general theme will be the \"Art of Science\", but it is not intended to be restrictive, and entries not necessarily directly inspired by science or technology will be\nfavourably considered.\nPrizes are to be awarded for the best exhibits. The proposed categories are:\n1. paintings, produced by any means \u2014 brush, foot, bicycle wheel, projectiles, etc in any\nstyle \u2014 Realist, Impressionist, Abstract, Imperialist.2. sculptures of any material, mobile or stationary, or even self destroying.3. science fiction. John Wyndham has shown an interest in judging entries and prefers3 P about people in novel situations rather than writing about gadgets.\n4. music inspired by science or generated in novel ways.\n5. robots and useless inventions like a Heath Robinson device to feed Mooney straight from\nkitchen to diner.

Q.P. Burdess\n\" Democracy only an experiment\" \"DEMOCRACY in India is o:nly an experiment\", said Mr Hhanna, Foreign Correspondent of\nTHE TIMES OF INDIA at a joint meeting of the Indian and Communist Societies. As such, it is not an essential part of the Indian nation, but may be discarded if it is seen to have\nfailed'.\nAt present, democracy cannot be said to have either completely failed or completely\nsucceeded. It has given India dignity and a sense of unity, born with her independence\n(an achievement conspicuously Lacking in the cases of Egypt or the USSR, for instance),& the economic record is impressive. Howevenji the gap be tw. een the rich and the poor has not yet been closed, there has\nbeen no significant rise i^n living standards, and the government has completely failed to\ncontrol the population e^i osi on. At the moment all the political talent, much of it mediocre, lies in the Congress l arty. The Communists ar^ed is united and of a very low calibre, and military rule v rou ld be\nunrepresentative of a jj j. the peoples, and thus democracy has the best chance of succeeding,\nso long as it can fir^ d strong leaders. The ensuing dis.s cus sion concerned itself mainly with comparing the situation in China\n(which was where t bie Communist Society came into its own) and India. The Communists were\nat a great disadvantage as they knew very little of the problems of India, and were unc ert a in as to how to solve them. Much interesting discussion took place, however, and\nproved most informative./ Martin Bell Drugs raid TWO Cambridge University undergraduates have been summonsed under the 1965 Dangerous\nDrugs Act; this, follows a recent raid on a drug-peddling centre.\nNUS to call national strike?

    "content": "2 FELIX Comment Editor I^W*} SfostJtlhldflL An open epistle\nLoans lobby\nWhat did we gain?\nIC UNION has now made its feelings on the possible introduction of a loans system to university students clear to Members of the\nParliament just dissolved.\nIn spite of its perhaps disappointingly small numbers, last fortnight's lobby is considered by\nthe organisers to have been a success. The first question that will be asked \u2014 if it has not\nalready been raised \u2014 in view of the bare\nhundred oddI C students is ' Do we really care?\" The answer cannot but be to the affirmative. As the last Union Meeting showed, the majority \u2014 some three times as many as went to\nWestminster \u2014 are in favour of the present syst em of no onus for repayments. But few are\nprepared to do anything practical. However, there is a significant minority who are\nin favour of a system of loans. Many of\nthese have suffered through the means test, and they also had their spokesmen at Westminster.\nIt is debatable whether our action will have any\nnoticeable effect when and if a Bill for student\nloans is put before Parliament. But we have\nat least stirred that elephantine body to which we do not contribute \u2014 the National Union of\nStudents \u2014 into activity. In just one week\nthey have scraped the butter from one side of their slice of bread and spread it on the other.\nA fortnight ago NUS was uncommitted and resented ICU's action. Last week President\nBill Savage announced that the loans issue\nhad loomed from the back cloths to centre\nstage \u2014 reducing the question of membership of IS Cand/or IUS to petty squabbles.\nCertainly a number of MPs were agreeably impressed by IC's representation. Now we\nshould move on to consider the whole question\nof payments to students. What we want now\nis, surely, the same as one Union Meeting last\nyear requested\u2014a full maintenance grant not\nsubject to a means test. No compromise will\ndo.\nDear Person, Wake UP, hap pU Campers Thankyou for your letter of the last issue, I feel obliged to strain my limited intelligence to its\nI nearly vomited with joy when I read that the\nCollege will manage to create fifty new places for\nparking by arranging cars diagonally and other\nstunts. My reaction to the news about the Col cut t flagpole was indescribably voluminous. How the\nCollege can persist in a\" head-in-the-sand \" policy on the vast areas of free ground in and around the new buildings beats me. So the tower is going to be a free standing campanile \u2014 wonderful, just\nwhat we need. And the land around it landscaped\nthey say, \u2014 oh lovely; it'll make the tutorial sheets\nseem much easier. Of course, it can only do this\nif you can get into College in the first place. With cars on the increase, and parking places on the de-crease, it will soon be\" impossible to even get here.\nIs it realistic to turn this place into an academic Disneyland, when the flat areas could be usefully\nutilised as car-parks? There is plenty of grass in Hyde Park, why do we have to add to it? And as\nfor that fab by tower \u2014 ugh! very boundaries to reply to your thesis, drawn no\ndoubt by your irresistible carrot.\nTo say that FELIX readers are bored may be\ntrue; sales seem to indicate that bore do iri is very popular, and so why not give the people what they\nwant, Iam worried by your assertion that better\nmaterial is excluded, and your further suggestion\nthat Iam replaced by a regular sermon from your crowd. I cannot imagine anything more scintillating than a broadside of preaching to grace the\npages of FELIX; surely even Cooper's nonsense is\npreferable to 8 column inches of religious in d ul gence and political\" proper gander.\" And since you started the personal insults track,\nmay I suggest that instead of on l\" getting up off\nyour knees to reach for your Thesaurus, you spare\na few minutes a day sorting out the sheep from the goats; pr should it be gentiles from the P hari sees?

However, as\none who has for some time had the\nunenviable job of attempting to get\npeople to read posters, may I suggest\nthat before condemning the various\npublicity officers in IC he should attempt to find an easier solution than\nbanning sex.\nIn a College with so much internal\nadvertising\u2014much of it of a very high\nstandard\u2014it is difficult to get one's posters read unless they are eye-catching and stand out from the mass.\nHaving accepted this one simple\nfact\u2014obvious to those of even limited\nintellect\u2014we must find'an eye-catch-ing poster. Regrettable though it\nmay be, one very effective gimmick\nin an almost completely male society\nis a pretty girl ; this 'has been proved\nto work over and over again.\nIf Mr. Baramki would like to contact me I would be pleased to hear\nhis suggestions for improved publicity.\nIt is perhaps best to conclude by\nasking which College poster has had\nmost effect on Mr. Baramki. Could I suggest that this is a measure of is effectiveness as publicity, defined\u2014Hot\nby me\u2014as the art of keeping the\nname of the product in the eye of\nthe public as much as possible.\nCould it be the FELIX poster in\nquestion, my only complaint about it\nis the poor standard of reproduction.\nPHILIP L.

At the\nlime of writing, almost two weeks\nsince the Utters were sent out, we\nhave received only nine replies; if\nthose in positions of responsibility\ncannot be relied on to reply to a request such as this, we suggest that\nthey should not have taken on their\nrespective jobs.\nWill the people who have not yet\nreplied please do so with the utmost\nhaste so that we can get on with our\njob of organising the /'etc.\nR.W.

    "content": "FELIX5 VISITING LIVERPOOL \u2014\nUNIVERISTY EXPANSION\nIN THE NORTH\nLand of the expensive Halls\nand stark white union\nquality of the food are constant grumbling points.\nOne member of the University who has sampled\nMooney' s Food here says that perhaps Liverpool produces slightly better quality food, but in much smaller portions. The completely whitewalls of the hr ge Halls and corridors means that unless there is ag \u2122\"it\nnumber of students in the building it appears\nempty. There are none of the furnishings and paintings which soften the appearance of modern buildings, as in Southside. This, I was told, is\nbecause the grant for the building was cut before\nthe full furnishings could be put in. The old building has been closed for reno-. at! a and during this period the Union is wit:.,..: \u201e\ncoffee bar and the only places where students\ncan go are the large refectories, this makes it\ndifficult for small groups to discuss things in a pleasant atmosphere.\nFor students it would seem on first sight that the\nCity of Liverpool offers many op port vi r. Uies for recreation and enjoyment, but altho sig it has\nprobably got more beat cellars than afi y other town in the country it is very lacking in theatres, art\ngalleries and the attractions which we have such\neasy access to in London. Liverpool is one of the oldest provincial\nUniversities and is situated in an area famous\nfor it's beat music. It has been called the\n\" modern culture \" centre of England. The\nUniversity has all faculties and is not just\nconfined to science and technology as we are\nat Imperial College.\nThe University is being expanded to cater\nfor about 10,000 students although there are\nonly about half that number at present.\nAbout one third of these students are in the\nHalls of Residence which are situated 2\\\nmiles from the University in a University\nVillage which is being expanded as new Halls\nare built.\nEXPENSIVE HALLS It is University policy that all girls should be\nin Hall, but a few are allowed out to live in approved flats in their final year and if they are\nover 2 1 .\nAt the price of \u00a36 15s. which may be going up to \u00a37 15s. next year, these are some of the most\nexpensive Halls of Residence in the country. As well as paying this basic price, which includes\nmeals, except for lunch, there are many other\ncharges which have to be borne by the students.\nEverybody must buy a gown to wear at the weekly formal dinners, and make compulsory contributions to the Hall Libraries and other funds.\nThe new Halls of Residence have been built to\na higher standard internally than Southside, though externally the appearance, which is copied from traditional Oxbridge colleges, is ble..ka:.J austere.\nEach student has a room of his own which is\nwell furnished and has the advantage of a partitioned off washbasin. Those students who are either not rich enough or unable to get entry into these Halls live in approved digs scattered over the whole of the Liverpool area.\nTHE LARGE, WHITE WALLED UNION\nIn order to allow for the expansion which is\ntaking place a large new Union building has been\nbuilt alongside the old one. It is a vast and impressive building from the outside but with a very sparsely furnished interior.\nThe Refectories are enormous and impersonal dining factories and have been designed to cater\nfor a peak flow of 10,000 students at lunchtime.

Alas,\nthis was not to be. There were\npieces of bawdy humour but these\nwere scarce.\nThe plot involved the swindling dealings of a wily threesome, Jeremy the servant, Subtle the profesional al chemist and Dol Common. The scene is the house owned by Jeremy' s master who has fled London because\nof the plague. The story is involved with many double dealings, ending with the return of Love wit, the master,\nthe fleeing of Subtle and Dol after\nbeing exposed by Jeremy who man ages to clear himself by further double dealings.\nA reasonable cast had great difficulty with the first act which was dull. Some unexpected humour came when Lesley Slater as Dol, sat on Jeremy's sword in a playful embrace. Martin Clarke' sad lib be d\"I'm terribly sorry!\" went down very well, After the first interval the situation improved. Lesley Slater came into her own with some very lively acting.\nMartin Clarke changed his accent con^\nvinci n gly and Mike Smith as Subtle\nmanaged to survive long periods on stage magnificently. Geoff Key te, as\nthe angry boy, and Alan Auch ter lou nie, as Dapper, proved to be\nnatural comedians. A special mention must be made of a certain parson, Denys Bennett, who stole the last\nscene without even saying a word. The set was adequate and the rev ol ving part worked very well. It was unfortunate that the scenery was so\nstark, a trend of the modern theatre\nwhich is not really suitable for a Jacobean play.\nIn conclusion, great credit must\ngo to Mike Smith who not only took\none of the major parts but also\ndirected the play. It is sad that all the\neffort which these few, obviously dedicated, actors have put into the\nplay will be wasted in front of half empty houses.\nPeter Combe s. "

Imperial College+118 imp2. Exeter+99 imp3. Edinburgh+97 imp4. London+83 impEach team had to play two hands against every other team, and the aggregate difference between the scores\nat the two respective tables was translated into international match points,\nimps. At the halfway stage, with twelve out of the twenty five matches\ncomplete d,I.C. led the field with a score of+71 imps, followed by last\nyears winners, Edinburgh, with+59 imps. Several other teams were by no means out of the running at this\npoint, particularly strongly situated\nbeing an experienced London University team with+58.In the second half, however, the\nhands\" were on the whole rather featureless, and it was merely a question of sitting back and allowing( and in some cases encouraging) the opp osi tion to make mistakes.

In the main concert hall of the Royal College of Music on Friday, an overflowing audience hear-ing the I.C. choir performing Monte verdi's Vespers might well have said\nexactly the same thing. The Ves pro Delia Beata Verg in e were specifically\nwritten for the Cathedral of St. Mark and St. John in Venice. The I.C. choir did their best to reproduce the same\nsound as could have been heard in Venice four centuries ago.\nDr. Brown led the choir with ease\nand familiarity through this complicated piece of music, and they contrasted vividly with the seven soloists\nto product the harmonious interaction Vh ich is an essential feature of Monteverdi' s choral works. Among the more unusual effects\nemployed were \u00a3 harp is chord and cornett i to link choral movements and an off-stage voice to produce an ethereal effect in certain psalms.\nFor an extraordinarily difficult piece\nof music the I.C. choir performed admirably; only towards the end during the Sancta Maria or a pro nobis did a combination of repetitive phrases and cacophonous musical effects partly break the spell and charm of the even-ing.\nPete Wall um wi ht Chris O' Donnell. Touchstone Weekend on 'Race*\nEducation Needed\nby Martin Bell. M R.A.H. CHRISTIE, M.A., Hon. Sec. of the Royal Anthropological Institute, was the speaker at the last Touchstone weekend\non \"Race.\" No ardent \"pure racists!1\n\" were present, and so the\nweekend was mainly spent discussing what forms race prejudice took\nand how it could be prevented.\nHe dealt first with the myth of race from biological facts ; there\nis no biological validity for doubting that man is all of one single\nspecies, Homo sapiens. The human race has not had time to develop\nsignificant mutations, but isolated groups had. adapted themselves to\ncircumstances and had responded to ecological pressures. For\ninstance, the genes of Jewish groups throughout the world were found\nto have no common factors and the genes approximated to the\ngroups in which the Jews were situated, in spite of their end oga mou s, isolated situation. Thus the notion of pure \" race \" was nonsense.\nThere was a tendency, he said, in\nall races to regard a fair skin as socially desirable. It indicated wealth\nand leisure, and he referred to the\nupper class Thai girls who could not\nget married because of their dark\nskins. There were psychological reasons also, such as fear of the dark\nand the fundamental mystery of\nLight/Dark, Good/ Evil. The world\nis for many divided into \" them \" and\n\" us\" under the slogan \" abroad is\nbloody,\" but though differences\nmight be social, religious, historical,\nli qu al, technological, and coloured,\nthere was no such thing as fundamental inferior or superior races.\nIt was decided that the best, indeed\nthe only, answer to racism is wide spread and early education, but that\nthis was not enough by itself : one\nmust also legislate against racial discrimination( the UL lodgings bureau was criticised for keeping the names\nof landladies who discriminate rac-i ally), in order to speed the process\nup. We must all facilitate mixed marriages and hope to remove the undesirable social consequences, especially\nfor the children. For race mixture has had practically nothing but good effects upon man as an organism, and as for the effects on him as a civilised JEZEBEL, rebuilt and minus lad-der s, app ea ring in public for the first\ntime for several years at the RCS Motor Club's rally of veteran commercial vehicles in Imperial Institute\nRoad last Saturday.

Indeed, Brazil has progressed further in solving the\nracial problems than any other\ncountry, and it has been said brat, the best long term solution is the production of a kind of me st iso race.\nSuch weekends, with excellent food\nand glorious surroundings at a very\ncheap price, ought to be in very high\ndemand.

II 0\nIn a hard fought game at Motspur Park, both defences played\nvery weD and it was not until the last minute of the first half that\neither team had a clear cut shot a', goal. The I.C. forwards never\nmanaged to penetrate the U.C. defence or to even pin them down\nin their own half for any length of time. But U.C. were having a similar problem in beating an LC. defence in which Burnett was\nparticularly prominent during the early part of the game.\nDavies caused U.C. some trouble with along rundown the left wing, but after half an hour's play, a hard cross from the U.C. left wing found its way through a crowd of players in the I.C. penalty area and glanced off\nDavies into the net.\npoor refereeing\nThe remainder of the first half was a good example of how poor refereeing can allow a game to degenerate\ninto a brawl. Several blatant fouls were allowed to go un penal is ed, until the U.C. left back kicked Smart, who was lying on the ground, right in front of the referee. Fortunately both teams\ntook control of themselves and despite\nsome bewildering decisions by the referee, incidents of this type were not repeated.\nIn the dying minutes of the first half I.C. fought hard for the equalise r,and Lux ton was unlucky to see his shot\nheaded off the U.C. line for a corner.\nAfter the interval, the U.C. attack\nbegan to look more dangerous, and Hewer dine was forced to make some\nexcellent saves from snap shots by the U.C. forwards. The I.C. defence, with Grundy blocking the middle very effectively, held steady, and I.C. cameo a ck into the game. They never looked like scoring though, except when the U.C. had to move quickly to gather\na good shot by Smart. With only a few minutes to go be fore full time, the U.C. centre forward slipped through the I.C. defence, and despite the close attention of Grundy, he put a good shot past Hewer dine into the corner of the net.\nform lacking\nThe outstanding players on the field\nwere both centre halves. Grundy for I. C.had an excellent game and along with Davies and Barnett formed a rear guard which U.C. had difficulty in beating. In the U.L. League, both teams have very good defensive\nrecords, but both have also scored a large number of goals, and it was a pity that neither attack could find\ntheir true form. However; U.C. de served their victory and having also\ncome top of their league division, must be congratulated on a very successful season.\nI.C. team: \u2014 Hewer dine, Barnett, Davies; Johnson, Grundy, Cooper; Lux ton,S mart, Whittle, White, Os borne.\nLower Reserves Cup Bob Clayton\n6th s MISS THE BOAT\nI.C. VI2 \u2014 N. POLY II 3\nIn the Final of the University\nof London Lower Reserve\nLeague Cup, played at Motspur\nPark on Saturday morning, I.C.6 th team failed to push home the\nadvantage of being one goal up\nat half-time and finally let the\nmatch slip, losing 3-2 to Northern\nPolytechnic 2nd XI.\nThe early start seemed to have more effect on the Northern Poly side for after only6 minutes, Robins, the I.C. captain, headed the ball against the\ncrossbar, following a corner from the right. Seven minutes later, Hall pushed\nalong ball through the middle and Harrison shot past the advancing goalkeeper to put I.C. into the lead.\nUntil halftime, I.C. continued to play good football, with the strong defence\nkeeping the Northern Poly forwards at\nbav.\ni.C. started the second half well with the Northern Poly, 'keeper sav The Northern Poly goalie just\nmanages to gather a header from\nCaptain Alan Robins during the\nsecond half.\ning his side several times, but g radu ally the tables began to turn and I.C. looked unsure in midfield. After20 minutes, a mistake led to Northern Poly, equal is in g,I.C.' s one goal. With in the next 15 minutes, defensive\nerrors and two cracking shots from the\nNorthern Poly, forwards put I.C.31d own. Nevertheless, I. C.had not given up and immediately came back\nto score through Harrison, following a cross from the right.\nWith less than 10 minutes left, I.C. pressed hard, but found the Northern Poly, defence too hard a nut to crack,\nand at the final whistle it was Northern Poly, who did the cheering.\nHowever, I.C. can remember the fame and glory of previous rounds and must\nbe congratulated on reaching the final\nand only hope to go one better next\nseason.\nMalcolm Whittle heads down in\nfront of the U.C. goal.

After their long run of being able to claim to be the best college team\nin the country the Judo club has inevitably fallen to lesser heights.\nAs defending champions in the inter collegiate championships they\nwere this year only able to reach the semi-final. However as a club\nthey are possibly more successful than before in strength of numbers,\nparticularly newcomers, and this is just as valuable. Arid that's the way it will always go at a transitory place like a University and the main thing is that we get the most from the talent we have.\nOn the whole we manage to do just that most of the time. Particularly encouraging are the number of people who achieve a very high individual standard of performance in their particular sport.\nSPORT FOR EVERYBODY\nIt may seem much too premature but this is the last opportunity I'll have\nto encourage everybody togo to Sports Day. May11 is the date and Mot spur Park the place. That' s the third Wednesday of term and there will be plenty of free transport from the Union. This year we are\nhoping to improve on the usual poor attendances, and there are\nplenty of new attractions to encourage you to go along. Firstly it's the middle of Carnival week so you will all be in a\" sporty' mood, there will be a mile walk and other new sport events to supplement the\nusual tug of war and staff race.\nFor those actually interested in the real sport there will be added\ninterest with the participation of Munich University in the match( competing against the college team of course). If two hundred people\ncould go to watch the Rugby final on a Saturday afternoon it should be possible to have a fair crowd for Sports Day which is, after all, an official college half holiday. \u201e , \u201e .\nFrank Hobson\nBadminton\nHOPEFUL YEAR\nAlthough our first team had a much weakened team from that of last year, the position of first in the University of London League was retained for the fifth consecutive year. Congratulations must also go to I.C. II who did extremely well to come second\nconsidering that last yea f they were\npractically bottom in the first division. This season, having entered two more teams, in the second division, has been proved more than successful\nlook ng at the positions obtained in the secon.1d i vision table.\nIn the mixed league with only one of last year's male members playing a creditable position of second was obtained. In the BUS F championships held earlier this year, K.T. Lee of I.C. won the Men's Singles, K.T. Lee and M. Fitzgerald lost in final of the Mens Doubles; M. Fitzgerald and J. Lid dle( London) beat K.T. Lee and A. Wood( London) in the final of the\nMixed Doubles. In the other two events, Women's singles and Doubles, London students reached the finals\nthough none were from I.C. R.G.
