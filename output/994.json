The\nIsraeli authorities claimed the killer was a lone\nderanged man. This comes as one incident\namongst many such 'lone incidents' committed\nby 'lone deranged people'.\nUpon hearing the news of the massacre, the\nPalestinian populace under occupation poured into\nthe streets in an expression of anger and protest.\nThe Israeli army responded with opening fire on\nthe outraged protesters killing at least seven more\nDear Felix\nOn behalf of the International Tamil Society\n(ITS), I hereby make a formal complaint to the\npresident of the Sri Lankan Society (SLS) for\nthe article written in Felix (11th March), titled\n'Negative Images'. It was stated that the article\nrepresented the views of SLS, yet when\napproached the SLS president stated that those\nwere the views of an individual but not the\nsociety's. Ironically the vice president of SLS\nwas not even made aware of the existence of\nsuch an article.\nThis article was a damaging attack on ITS for\nour recent photographic exhibition in which we\nwere merely exercising our right to display our\nculture and also to reveal how our culture is\nbeing slowly destroyed. The article begins by\nstating that the \"importance was obviously being\nplaced on a set of photographs depicting\nsuffering in Sri Lanka\". This shows the true\nignorance of the author as this was one of our\naims in the first place. We dispute the claim that\nthe exhibition was used as a \"vehicle for\npropaganda\" as the video that was shown to the\nDear Felix,\nHaving read last week's Felix (11th March\n1994), one particular sentence alarmed me\nconsiderably: \"I 've been told by the President\nthat Felix is not allowed to 'champion the cause\nof new election'...\"\nThis raises two very important questions;\nfirstly, since when has our 'honourable'\nPresident been able to dictate editorial policy in\nFelix? I was led to believe that Felix was a journal dedicated to student issues, student news\nand student representation, not a personal\npropaganda machine for Mr Wensley. Clearly,\nthe much vaunted phrase 'Keep the cat free' has\nnot yet worked its way into the presidential\nivory tower.\nSecondly, and perhaps most importantly, why\nexactly has Mr Wensley decided to conceal the\nright to vote for New Election? Whilst his aims\npeople. Since then, twenty more people were shot\ndead by the Israeli army. Curfew was also\nimposed on the whole of occupied Palestine and\nthe army patrolled the area, while the settlers went\non with life as normal.\nThe very existence of the settlements is illegal\nby international law and the fourth Geneva\nconvention. A number of UN resolutions have\nalready been passed urging Israel to dismantle\nthe settlements, though none were implemented.\nSettlers pose a direct threat to the lives and\nsecurity of the Palestinian people under\noccupation. Until the steps for their removal\nfrom the West Bank and Gaza Strip become\npublic was an in de pe dent and unbiassed report\nby Australian TV on the plight of Tamils.\nSince its formation ITS has been very\nsuccessful in having organised many social and\ncultural events including a major cultural show\n'Shankarabharanam' depicting our rich Tamil\nculture.\nITS members feel under obligation to express\nthe suffering of the Tamil people anywhere in\nthe world. However, it is only in Sri Lanka\nwhere they are being reportedly persecuted,\nwhich led us mainly to expose the sufferings in\nNorth and East of the island. The ITS\nunderstands, regrettably, that the Sri Lankans in\nthis college feel uncomfortable with their\ncountry's precious image being tarnished, but it\nis our duty as true Tamils to show the world the\nharsh reality facing us.\nThe author finally concludes by asking the\nSocial Clubs Committee (SCC) to think\ncarefully before author ising such displays, but\none actually wonders if displaying the sufferings\nof innocent people is an offence?\nS. Kirupakaran, President of the ITS.\nare usually hard to comprehend at the best of\ntimes, this seems unbelievable.\nSadly, it is impossible to find out exactly\nwhat the President thinks he is playing at, and\nspeculation is rarely productive, so the only\nrecourse is to vote in the elections, and hope for\nthe best for next year. This I intend to do (or,\nwill have done by the time this is printed), and\nunless I am radically impressed by certain\ncandidates, New Election will doubtless receive\nsome votes from me - but my confidence in the\nreturning officer and the elections is severely\nundermined when it is revealed that he is\nmaking a concerted effort to conceal one the\nmost important aspects of the Union's democratic election process.\nYours,\nTim Walls, DoC 1.\naffected, the settlers must immediately be\ndisarmed, and international protection provided\nfor the Palestinians at risk.\nThe withdrawal of the Israeli troops and the\nend of the military occupation of the West Bank\nand Gaza Strip constitute the only way to ensure\nthe safety of the Palestinian population currently\nunder occupation.\nI believe that the world should support the call\nof the Palestinian people for the end of\noccupation, the immediate removal of settlers\nfrom the area and the provision of International\nprotection for the unarmed Palestinian population.\nSaibri Saidam, Elec Eng.\nWrong Images\nDear Felix,\nI am writing to you on behalf of the\ncommittee of the Sri Lankan Society of Imperial\nCollege, regarding the article titled 'Negative\nImages' which was printed in the Felix of\nMarch 1994. The article was ended with the\nstatement 'These are the views of the Sri\nLankan Society of Imperial College'. We wish\nto make it clear to everyone concerned that this\narticle was printed without the knowledge of our\ncommittee. Therefore in no way does anything\nstated in the article represent the view of the Sri\nLankan Society of Imperial College.\nThe Sri Lankan Society is devoted to raising\nawareness of Sri Lankan culture within Imperial\nCollege, as well as to provide all those\ninterested in Sri Lanka with a chance to meet\neach other. As a result our society consists of\npeople of various nationalities, races, religions\nand opinions. Therefore to represent the many\nviews of our members in one article as the view\nof the Sri Lankan Society is impractical and we\nwould not attempt to do so.

    "content": "10 Clubs and Societies\nOlya's Story Football - ULU Sixes\nThis is a survivor's dramatic account of the\npersecution of Baha'fs in revolutionary Iran. In\nthe 1980s, hundreds of Baha'fs were arrested,\nimprisoned and executed at the hands of the\nIranian revolutionary government. Olya\nRoohizadegan was one woman who got away\nand now, ten years later, she has written the first\neye-witness account of the events that shocked\nthe world.\nOlya's account of her own imprisonment,\ntrial and sentencing is also the story of ten\nwomen who did not survive and with whom she\nshared her ordeal. The women's resilience to the\nharsh conditions of prison life is all the more\nremarkable in view of the intense psychological\nand - in some cases physical - torture to which\nthey were subjected on a daily basis. It is felt\nthat their executions may have been part of a macabre drive against women's liberation, for\nthe Baha'f Faith is the first world religion to\npromote the equality and men and women.\nThe persecution still goes on. The Baha'f Faith is not recognised under the constitution of\nIran, leaving Baha'fs to suffer discrimination at\nevery level.\nOlya Roohizadegan worked for the Iranian\nOil Company until her arrest and imprisonment.\nAfter a dramatic overland escape to Pakistan,\nwith her husband and three-year-old son, she\ncame to Britain, where she now lives.\nOlya's story has raised much interest in the\nmedia, with major features in The Times, The\nDaily Mirror, CNN TV and The Scotsman,\nnumerous radio interviews including LBC, GLR\nand Woman's Hour, in addition to considerable\nlocal newspaper and radio coverage during the\nauthor's ongoing nationwide tour.\nOlya Roohizadegan will be speaking at IC on\nSaturday 19th March, 7.30pm, Union Dining\nHall, 1st Floor, Union Building.\nTournament\nThe Imperial College Football Club entered one\nteam to the UL U Sixes tournament held last\nweekend at Motspur Park. This is not a competition for the faint-hearted. It involves\nplaying a number of consecutive six-a side\nmatches on a full-sized football pitch as well as\nwaking up at an unearthly hour on a Sunday\nmorning, usually following an evening of\nintense student social intercourse. Thus, when\nall seven members of IC's random laid-back\nsquad turned up at Motspur by 10.15 am, the\nbattle was half won.\nImperial were pitched into a tough qualifying\ngroup, with Royals, both Free and New, as well\nas the Orientals and Africans. The first match\nagainst Royal Holloway College 1st XI proved\nto be an eye-opener for IC, who played in- an\norderly fashion, but succumbed to the opposition\nby one goal. In the next three group matches\nImperial grew in confidence and mes meri sed spectators and opponents alike with their\nrandom laid-back style of stroking the ball\naround. Indeed, the boys from South Kensington\nachieved three consecutive victories against\nRoyal Free Hospital, SOAS and Royal\nHolloway thirds respectively.\nChris Evdemon pulled off spectacular saves\nin goal, whilst Roddy Herris controlled the left\nflank of the pitch with authority. Meanwhile at\nthe back, Andy Fenton covered with composure\nfor everyone, especially for Skipper Rakesh\nMuthoo, who was the most laid-back of the\nrandom s. Rob Franolic deceived many with his\ndemonic pace, unlike Billal Al-Khatib, who\nnevertheless scored a number of interesting\ngoals. The only other goal scorer was, Ben\nWillis, who used his famous forward thrusting\ntechnique in order to penetrate rival defences.\nThe semi-final, against the Royal Holloway\n2nd XI, was a display of Imperial's talent and\nflair, as they kept possession for most of the\ngame and produced numerous goal scoring\nopportunities. However, it also exposed their\nshortcomings, as IC were unable to score during\nthe sanctioned period of time, the outcome of\nthe clash had to be decided on the basis of a nerve wrecking penalty shoot-out. Here the\ncunning Evdemon raised the stakes by using the\nleft-side diving method. He eventually stopped\nan opposition penalty at the sudden death stage,\nheroically sending his side into the final against\nRoyal Holloway 1st XI.\n\"Once bitten, twice shy,\" goes the saying, but\nIC were unperturbed by their previous defeat to\nHolloway in the opening match. Having come\nfull circle, Imperial were fully confident as they\nrecalled Germany's upset against Hungary in the\n1954 World Cup Final. In fact, IC dominated the\ngame with a spider-web passing style\nreminiscent of Cruyff's1974 total football side\nand yet again created several goal scoring\nopportunities. However, unable to capital is e on\ntheir superiority, the Imperial players started to\ntire, mentally and physically.\nThe only exception was Willis, ULU's rising\nstar, who continued to thrust forwards and\nbackwards but he too failed to score. Instead it\nwas Holloway who struck thirty seconds from\nthe end, following Murphy's law and bringing\ntears to IC supporters. The final whistle was\nblown shortly afterwards and there was nothing\nleft to do but collect the Runners-up medals,\nshower and drive to the nearest curry house. It\nwas a very good day.\nLet's Face The Music, And...\nLast year, Imperial College hosted the 30th InterVarsity Dancing Competition at the\nGrosvenor House Hotel, Park Lane. There, we\nwon both team trophies, stretching our\ndominance of that competition to three years.\nLast Saturday, Liverpool University hosted this\nyear's event; twenty other universities were after\nblood (specifically ours!).\nThe trauma actually started the night before.\nHalf of the team was suckered into going to\nUxbridge, while the minibus was really in\nGreenford. One and a half hours later than\nplanned, we collected the minibus and rescued\nthe Uxbridge group - all we needed was a team\ntrainer and we could head for the frozen North.\nVicki was discovered huddled outside a cafe in\nOxford (where else?) - the \"We're going to be a little late\" message had not been delivered. Our\nother trainer, Dorothy, had wisely fled the\ncountry. While Vicki thawed, lead and Andrew\n(the only two ancient enough to be allowed to\ndrive), began the ultimate 'white knuckle ride'\nNorth.\nAfter spending the night in Blackburn, we\neventually reached the venue the Kirkby Civic\nSuite, Liverpool. As befits the defending\nchampions, we had been seated in a back corner,\nas far as possible from the dance floor. The\ndoors opened at 10.30am,a subtle ploy to ensure\nthat the southern universities would be asleep by\nthe Team Match at 7pm. We and Oxford had\nopted for staying in the vicinity overnight;\nneither of us relished the 4.45am start suffered\nby Cambridge.\nThe afternoon programme saw some\ncreditable individual performances in the Open\nCompetitions, as well as some surprises. The\nbest of the bunch were Nevil and Laura, who\nwon the Beginner's Cha Cha.\nFollowing the walk-on (in which we were\nintroduced as 'The University of Imperial'\n...hmmm!) the Team Match began. All of our\ncouples made their respective finals unfortunately the same was pretty much true for\nOxford, Cambridge, Bristol and Sheffield. The\nfinal results would be very close. Tragedy struck\na strong Liverpool A Team when their jive\ncouple withdrew through injury.\nThe results - we retained both the A and B Team trophies, in each case pushing Oxford into\nsecond place. This rounded off our second year\nof winning every team title at each of the three\nmain competitions.\nAt half past midnight we finally started the\nlong drive South, the drivers fully charged on\nadrenaline and high-octane caffeine. The\npassengers partied and then slept, while the\ndrivers philo soph is ed on life's mysteries.\nOur thanks to our trainers, Victoria Cunniffe\nand Dorothy Charlton and all who have helped\nto make this year so successful.\nA team; Bryan Crotaz & Sarah Cutmore;\nPaul Skjold & Zoe Antoniou;\nlead Rezek & Patricia Donnesteanu;\nSatin Gungah (capt) & Mani Amin.\nB team: Andrew Smith & Elaine Hornby;\nTuang Liang Lim & Lye Yet Tien;\nPeter Purdie & Sian Rowsell;\nKerwyn James & Ruth Schuster.\nAn article on trans en dental meditation is on pages 6 & 7\n\n"

    "content": "1 News\nSabbatical Elections Results\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nThis year's Imperial College Union\n(ICU) Sabbatical Elections have\nshocked candidates and bystanders\nalike.\nFollowing the casting of over\nseven thousand votes, the much\nfeared St Mary's block vote seems\nto have lost the 'king-maker' power\nwhich has marked recent elections.\nThe number of votes also caused\nproblems, with the first counts only\nfinished at 10:30pm. Those\ninvolved in the count spent six\nhours poring over ballot papers.\nAfter the results, Steve Dunton, one\nof those counting, said: \"It's been\nvery tiring.\"\nThe greatest surprise occurred in\nthe race for the Presidency. At the\nfirst count, St Mary's support put\nNew Election in second place to\nLucy Chothia. Paul Thomas,\nexpected to be one of the stronger\ncontenders, had the least votes.\nAfter the re-allocation of Mr Thomas's votes, the result was still\nundecided. It was only after the\nsecond reallocation (of Kamran\nBashir's) votes, that Lucy Chothia\nwas declared the winner with 870\nvotes.\nCommenting to Felix on the way\nforward, Miss Chothia said: \"I am\ngoing to start talking about the\nsecond-hand bookshop now,\nbecause that is something that I can\nwork on, not being in power,\nwithout treading on someone's toes.\"\nIn the other elections, the job of\nthe Mary's vote was merely one of\nconfirmation. All of the victors\nsecured a sufficient majority of\nvotes without the Mary's block. In\naddition, all of the other posts were\ndecided on the first count. The\nvictorious candidates are: Dan\nLook, Deputy President-elect\n(Finance & Services), the winner\nwith a margin of 111 votes; Ian\nParish, Deputy President-elect\n(Clubs & Societies), claiming a margin of 21 votes and Owain\nBennallack, Felix Editor and Print\nUnit Manager-elect, sporting a margin of 337 votes. The overwhelming mandate given to Mr Bennallack would have resulted in a win even if his 336 Mary's votes\nhad gone to Joe McFadden.\nThose elected will take up their\nposts on the 1st July. The current\nSabbaticals finish their employment\non the 31st July, following a one\nmonth 'change-over' period. The\nimportance of training has been\nstressed by ICU President Andrew\nWensley.

    "content": "Opinion 21\nMedia Matters\nDear Cat,\nOh deary, deary us; Mr James Handley does\nseem to have his knickers in a 'bit of a twist'.\nWe are, of course, referring to his rather\nsplendid effort of y ester week 'Aerial Views'.\nWhat a joy it was to behold, and it did, indeed,\ngive us the utmost pleasure to read such acid\ntoned prose. Magnificent, well done Sir.\nHowever, we are deeply saddened to discover\nthat Mr J. Handley 'et caster a', were not amused\nby our comment that television requires a greater production effort than radio. Well James,\nlet us try and explain, and attempt to diffuse\nsome of your little perplexities and\nmisconceptions. Firstly, we stand by our\n'offhand' comment, having both had personal\nexperience of the professional Television and\nRadio media industries. Hence, after considered\nmeditation on the matter, we have come to the\nresolute conclusion that TV waves do require a more concerted effort in their origin, than their\nradio 'counterparts'. This is but a simple fact\nand after all 'a picture does tell a thousand\nwords', eh Bee? No jingoistic glee or\nostentatious nous is taken in this reality and it\nconcerns us in the extreme that it does not\nconcur with your sentiments.\nThe reason for ourselves not joining the\norgasmic ally exciting ICR, is that for us, STOIC\nhas an added dimension that makes it quite\ndistinct from other media forms at Imperial. This\ncomes in the guise of film production, a media\nDear Felix,\nI do not believe that Jon Jordan inhabits\nreality. Anyone who sports a goatee as pointed\nas his and who spends his entire waking hours\nlistening to the witless spewing s of Indie music\ncannot honestly lay claim to more than a tenuous\nlink with the real world. I do not, however,\nbelieve that he is a \"bigot\" or a \"fascist\" and if\nSagar Das really holds this opinion then he too\nmust be living out a fantasy. Mr Jordan merely\nstated that it would be naively optimistic to think\nthat Nationalism could be overcome. I totally\nagree with him - when I originally wrote\n\"nationalism is a dangerous absurdity and the\nonly sensible way forward is internationalism\" I was not being optimistic, but merely stating the\nfacts. I personally hold little faith in the future of\nthe world and do not dream for a minute that\nNationalism can be destroyed at the drop of a hat. This does not make me a fascist any more\nthan Mr Jordan's pessimism does. If Mr Das\nwants to dispute the opinion that Nationalism\n(and its modern extension, which could for want\nof a better word be called ethnic is m), is one of\nthe most powerful political forces, then he\nshould remove his blinkers and look around him.\nLook for instance at Bosnia, look at Northern\nIreland. Look, if you will, at the burgeoning\ndispute between the Sri Lankans and the Tamils\nat our very own College! I cannot pretend to\nform that gives a creative outlet which is largely\npeculiar to moving visual media, by the fact that\nit is not inherently documentary. Thus, as a result of our experiences with Radio and\nTelevision, we feel that television and film\nproduction offers a much greater diversity than\nradio. This then, being the main reason for us\nnot joining the ICR society - or maybe we're\njust too damn good looking. However, being the\nliberal is ts that we are, maybe we should join\nICR to gain a greater understanding of the Radio\nproletariat. Perhaps Mr J. Handley would care to\ndo the same thing with regards to STOIC? That\nis, if he's not too busy....\nOnwards and upwards, to matters of a much\ngreater importance and urgency. Further to our\nprevious letter (Felix 992) and to the matter of a 'live link up TV show'. This would be between\nthe major London colleges and the aim would be\nto inject some much needed rivalry, back into\nthe UL U scene. It would be held during fresher s' week, with the emphasis on 'way out' fun and\ncompetition. We have spoken to various college\nunion presidents and they are in agreement that\nsuch an event has tremendous potential. All we\nneed now is some enthusiasm to help organise\nthe whole thing. So, anybody with showbiz\nideas or organisational tendencies, are urged to\nget involved by contacting us, ASAP.\nGood day to you all,\nAnthony Waite, Elec Eng 2.\nJames Harrow, Elec Eng 2.\nknow much about their situation but it seems to\nme that both sides are guilty of shameful\natrocities. The Sri Lankan situation seems to be\nlargely an accident of history and one that would\nbe very hard to resolve; but glorifying the\nviolence in inflammatory articles can do nothing\nto calm the situation and will only increase the\nfriction between the two groups. It would be\nmuch better if we could see the Tamils and Sri\nLankans of this College shaking hands and\nsettling their disputes, but will they do that? I doubt it. Such is the power of Nationalism.\nYours,\nMarcus Alexander.\nInternational\nNite Thanks\nDear Felix,\nI just wish to write a small note with a big\nTHANKYOU to Mustafa and everyone\ninvolved in the International Nite for producing\na wonderful evening, enjoyed by all.\nYours,\nMinever Kavlak.\nCold Shoulder\nDear Felix,\nThe High Commissioner of Malaysia,\naddressing IC students last Wednesday, was\nfond of metaphors. So am I. Try this one: A young, average-looking girl who blossoms into\nan attractive, voluptuous young woman who\nfinds herself surrounded by suitors asking for\nher hand. That girl is Malaysia, though many\nother names will soon fit as economic puberty\narrives in S.E. Asia.\nLike the popular girl, Malaysia realises her\npower to call the shots. The recent events are not\nabout shady deals, corruption, poor project\nchoices and certainly not about one newspaper's ability to mortally dishonour one of the region's shrewdest politicians. Malaysia took action\nsimply because she can. This is behaviour\nlearned from the developed world, and Malaysia\nis just flaunting a bit, such high-profile ruffling\nof western feathers plays superbly at home,\nwhere elections are coming soon.\nSo let all the actors (of which the British\nmedia is one) play out their roles. Soon\nsomeone else will get the gentle reminder of\nwho's in charge. Australia has felt it and even\nthe US has received the cold shoulder as\nMalaysia twice rebuffed personal invitations to\njoin other Pacific nations in Seattle last year.\nRegardless of what 'reasons' are offered,\nremember these events are really just growing\npains of a blossoming nation.\nKevin Wellenos, Civ Eng 3.\nDead Ground\nDear Felix,\nI feel compelled to write in response to the\nreview of The Pear's concerning On Deadly\nGround starring Steven Seagal and Michael Caine.\nIn light of watching the film I tentatively reread the review given on the 11th March (Issue\n993) in search of any possible irony, sarcasm or\nquite frankly, piss take! It is true on closer\nscrutiny such phrases as \"compassionate-but-hard status\", \"re-cycled the plot\" and\n\"unforgivable dialogue\" did set alarm bells\nringing, and a quick check to ensure that April\nl st was not too distant.\nHowever, be this review a send-up or not I fear the issue goes far beyond this, for this film\nis awful. Neigh atrocious. The plot, the script,\nthe acting, the continuity, etc, etc suck!\nPlease all people who read last week's review and even remotely considered paying \u00a36\nto see the film in questions - don't, give it to\ncharity, or even the Mormon Church, they look\nin need of a few bob.\nI feel that I should attempt to verify my\nresponse as genuine. I have seen Predator,\nTerminator even Steven Seagal's previous\nmovie Under Siege, all of which I enjoyed.\nAlbeit that the latter required a few beers\nbeforehand. But this feeble effort I did not.\nSo please, please, please, please....don't! Mr Daren U Lacasex(Ian Hawes, Mech Eng).\nDestructive Forces\nThe deadline for letters is 6pm on the Monday before publication\n\n"

Following an initial string of fourteen\nconsecutive defeats, there was a change in\nmanagement and composition of the team, but\nthis was not enough to avoid relegation from\nDivision One of the UL U league for the first\ntime in seven years.\nHowever, the mid-season restructuring of the\nteam has lead to a considerable amount of\npositive consequences. The seconds have played\nsome good passing football, with an emphasis\non teamwork and possession. They have had a number of wins and displayed some\ncommendable performances, such as when the\nleague champions UCL II struggled to a goalless\ndraw against them. Above all, Imperial seconds\nare a side of Corinthian values, with good team\nspirit and high team morale.\nChris Evdemon provided sound and, at times,\nspectacular goal keeping throughout the season,\nwhereas the reliable Matteo Farina has been the\nmost consistent player of the team. Playing\nalongside him, Rob Franolic was solid and quick\nin the middle of defence, and the youthful\nRoddy Herris tackled with determination and\nattacked with passion. In the middle of the field,\nAbs Said distinguished himself for his stubble\nand his hard-hitting goals, whilst Issam Morris\nwill be remembered as the man who came in\nfrom the cold with excellent crosses.\nThe Frenchman Anthony Clerc contributed\ngreatly to the midfield and only scored difficult\nWomen Win!\nThe Imperial Women's1st Eight took the\nrowing world by surprise last weekend when\nthey stormed to a highly impressive 9th place\noverall in the Women's Head of the River Race.\nThey won the Senior 2 divison, finishing only\none tenth of a second behind the University of\nLondon women, winners of the Universities'\nPennant, over the nineteen minute 'Boat Race'\ncourse. This marks a dramatic improvement in\nthe standard of women's rowing at IC, as they\nwere placed twenty-fourth in the same race last\nyear. This win follows closely behind their\nsuccess at the Reading Head two weeks ago,\nwhere they also won the senior 2 division, and\nwere the third fastest women's crew, finishing\nonly four seconds behind the Cambridge\nwomens Blue Boat.\nThe IC Women's2 nd Eight, a mix of novice\nand experienced oars women, also performed\nway above expectation, finishing 53rd out of the\n200 strong entry. (These results should spell\ngood news for the St Mary's Women's crew in\nthe bumps later this year, as some of them train\nand row in the IC crews.) The improvement is as\na combined result of the steadily expanding\nnumbers of the Women's boat club, the\ntechnical expertise of their coach Nick Wilde,\nand the intense (but highly effective) training\nprograms of the Boathouse Guru, Bill Mason.\nThe success was recognised by the national\npress earlier this week, which rarely features\nminority sports such as women's rowing. The\nwomen's crew now take a short break for Easter,\nbefore returning to prepare for the summer\nRegattas. Imperial will now be favoured to\nprovide a strong entry for the college eights at\nWomen's Henley.\nThe Boat Club Men's crews have also been\nenjoying success recently, placing 2nd and 4th overall at the Reading Head, where the Oxford\nBlue Boat won by five seconds. It is rumoured\nthat the IC 1st eight will race Oxford again this\nweekend to help them prepare for the Eights\nHead of the River and The Boat Race\n(respectively) which happen on the same day\nthis year. Both races will be covered on\nGrandstand next Saturday (26th March),\nincluding an interview with a member of the IC\nfifth eight, who will be the last crew to start this\nyear. It is hoped that our crews will continue the\nsuccess of recent years, winning no less than\nfour of the six events entered.\nIC In Final Of\nGutteridge Cup\nIC l st265 QMW\nLast Wednesday Imperial College l st XV Rugby team beat Queen Mary & Westfield\nCollege ( Q MW) in the Gutteridge Cup\nsemi-finals. Despite the harsh rugby conditions\n(ankle deep mud), IC turned on the pressure at\nQ MW and came away with a well earned\nvictory.\nThe first quarter on the match was spent\ncamped on the Q MW try-line, with IC\ncontrolling the game. Steve Townsend put the\nfirst points on the board with a storming drive\nfrom a maul in front of the posts.\nThe second try was scored by Andrew\nMontgomery, who dived into a retreating QMW\nsc rummage, as the ball crossed the line.\nQ MW replied early in the second-half with\nan un-converted try, but the match was sealed\nby Tim Oldham (interception and 70 yard sprint\nto the corner-flag).\nSustained forward pressure resulted in a penalty try as Q MW came off-side to prevent a push-over try.\nNext Week: Felix Easter Special\n\n"

The killer is carbon monoxide, a highly poisonous gas which has no colour and\nno smell.\nIt is produced when gas and coal appliances\nare used, such as gas heaters. If there is\ninsufficient air for the gas to escape (e.g. if the\nchimney or flue is obstructed or blocked), the\ncarbon monoxide can become dangerous.\nThe Danger Signs\nIf your appliances (gas heaters, water heaters\netc.) have stains, soot or d is colouring and/or\nthey produce yellow or orange flames, don't use\nthem.\nWhat Should You Do?\nTell your landlord or landlady that the appliance\nis faulty. (They have a legal duty to provide you\nwith safe accommodation.)\nThe appliance needs to be serviced at least once\na year. It is the responsibility of your landlord or\nlandlady to arrange this. The check must be\ncarried out by a qualified person. Corgi (0256\n708133) can be contacted for details of local\nqualified gas installers.\nIn the meantime ensure that any air vents are\nnot blocked so that the gas can escape.\nYou can obtain further advice from Minever\nKavlak, Union Adviser in the Students Union.\nShe operates a telephone service on ext 3507,\nTuesdays from 10.30a ml pm and on Thursdays\nfrom 2pm5 pm. Information can also be\nobtained from any British Gas office. Check\nphone book for details of local office.\nDon't put yourself at risk of carbon monoxide\npoisoning. Pick up a free leaflet on carbon\nmonoxide from the Student Union Office or from British Gas.\nBritish Gas have issued these rules\nfor safely using water heaters:\n\u2022 Make sure your bathroom is well ventilated.\nNever block or obstruct air vents.\n\u2022 Always open the bathroom door or window\nwhen you are running water.\n\u2022 Turn the water heater off before you get in\nthe bath. Never run more water once you are\nin the bath.\n\u2022 Do not run an un flue d instantaneous water\nheater for longer than five minutes at a time.\nThey are not intended to be used for filling\nbaths, showers or washing machines.\n\u2022 If you are concerned in any way about the\nappliance, stop using it immediately and\nseek help.\nYou are at risk of carbon monoxide poisoning\nif you continue to use faulty appliances.\nThe Eurpoean Economic Area\nAgreement (EEA)\nThis agreement came into force on 1st January\n1994. It affects people from Austria, Finland,\nIceland, Norway and Sweden who ratified the\nagreement.\nWhat does the agreement mean for students\nof those countries?\n\u2022 Minimal immigration control, visas not\nrequired to enter Britain.\n\u2022 The right to work.\n\u2022 The right to bring families (EEA nationality)\nto Britain.\n\u2022 'Migrant Workers' from EEA countries have\nthe same entitlement as European nationals to\nmandatory awards and student loans (not fees,\nonly awards).\n\u2022 EEA migrant workers also have the right to\nclaim home fees if 'ordinarily resident' in the\nUK.\n'Overseas' students do not have these rights.\nFurther advice is available from the UK Council\nfor Overseas Students Affairs on 071 354 5210\nor from Minever Kavlak, Union Adviser who\ncan be contacted on 071 589 5111 ext 3507.\nRegulation\nChanges For\nBenefits\nNew regulations have introduced 'Residence\nTests' for people who intend to claim benefits.\nIt is essential that advice is obtained before a benefit is claimed so that possible entitlements\nand immigration consequences can be\ndiscussed.\nAdvice can be obtained from the Union\nAdviser on ext 3507 (Tue 10.30a ml pm or Thur\n2pm5 pm) or from the Citizens Advice Bureau\n- check the telephone book for your local office\nor call 071 251 2000.\nMinever Kavlak, the Union Adviser can be contacted on ext 3507\n\n"

    "content": "16 Reviews\nCookery Corner:\nDahl and Rice\nHere's a simple recipe which gives you a nutritious and healthy meal\nin half an hour and is so simple to cook!\nIngredients:\n\u2022 Lentils\nRed are the best as they are the quickest to\ncook, but try others if you want varying the\ncooking time accordingly.\n\u2022 Fresh garlic, ginger and small green chillies.\n\u2022 Spices:\nSome Garam Masala, Turmeric, Red chilli\npowder.\n\u2022 Garnish: fresh coriander (optional but\nessential to make it perfect)\n\u2022 Oil, salt & pepper.\n\u2022 Basmati rice (no other will do)\nMost of these ingredients can be bought from\nyour favour ate supermarkets, but I'd recommend\nbuying all the ingredients from an Asian shop\nwhere the prices are much cheaper and the\nspices are likely to be fresh.\nI'm going to give you a recipe that will feed\ntwo but if you eat like me, I'd double the\nquantity.\nMethod:\n1. First thing, wash the lentils (a cupful should\nbe about two helpings). You never know\nwhere they have been and the cheapest\nvarieties often have small stones which are\nnot fun to chew. The best way is to put them\ninto the pan you intend cooking them in and\nrinse by pouring water over them until\nthey're covered and draining. I'd rinse them\nthree or four times at least.\n2. Boil up the lentils until they're cooked, this\ntakes about 15 minutes.\n3. In a separate small pan, heat 2 tablespoons\noil. Crush up 2 cloves of garlic and a small\ncube of ginger and chop up several green\nchillies (1 for mild and 4 for hot). Throw\nthese into the hot oil and brown as you smell\nthat delicious aroma!\n4. Throw the browned chillies, ginger and garlic\nonto the cooked lentils and stir. Then add the\nspices: a couple of teaspoons of Garam\nmasala, half a teaspoon each of turmeric and\nred chilli.\n5. Add salt and pepper to taste, and finally\ngarnish with the fresh coriander.\nServe with plain rice (see Delia Smith for that\none) and yoghurt. Hmmm!\nHints:\nTry fry ng whole cumin or mustard seeds in the\noil before you add the garlic etc.\nEat, Drink And Be Merry\nThe Vegetarian Cottage\nVegetarians tend to avoid Chinese when they eat\nout, unless they can stomach endless amounts of\ntofu. Not even Chinatown, with its multitude of\nrestaurants, can a decent full veggie meal be\nfound. So, when a friend mentioned to me that\nshe had come across a good Chinese-veggie, I was very interested - my flat mate, being a veggie, was even more so!\nThe Restaurant\nIt is in Belsize Park, easily accessible by the\ntube, and a great area to stroll around in. The\ninside reflects the area, looking quite classy, but\ncramped.\nThe Meal\nThere is soup or other starters to be eaten\ninitially, all costing around \u00a32. The Crispy Deep\nFried Milk is worth a try, so is the Vegetarian\nSesame Toast. I prefer starting though with a soup, the Winter Melon and Beancurd or\nCottage House seemed to be the best choices.\nThe Main Course. A delight of Chinese\nvegetarian choices - obvious I know, but oh so\nrare. Without doubt My Favourite Tofu\n(Beancurd with Sesame and Peanut Sauce) must\nbe ordered. Another 'must' is the Sweet and\nSour Fish, which only looks like a fish, but is\nmade of yam and has a crispy outer layer. We\nwere all positively drooling. Other dishes I wish\nI had tried were Vegetarian Duckling (deep fried\nlayers of Soya Bean sheets) Cottage Special, or\nthe Vegetarian Gold Cups. Happily they all cost\nunder \u00a35.\nFor those of you who cannot get by on\nvegetables alone, there are a few seafood dishes,\nwhich I feel spoil the essence of the restaurant,\nafter all why come to a veggie place to eat your\nstandard fare? There are rice and noodles of\nvarious flavours to go with the meal.\nThe Dessert. I recommend the Walnut\nPudding, I loved it. Walnuts are ground, and\nmade into a warm paste, ending up eventually\nlike a soup. The ice-cream deserves a mention,\nbecause it is made from soya milk. Avoid the\nlychees, you can buy a whole tin for a third of\nthe price from Sainsburys. The cost is under \u00a32\nfor them all.\nChinese Tea costs 50p per person, and there\nis coconut milk for \u00a31.50 for something different\nfrom coke and juice. There are two set menus,\nand special Sunday lunch menus. A full meal of\nthree courses will come to \u00a310 per head, very\nreasonable, but a bit pricey for vegetables.\nThe Service\nGood. Cantonese is not essential for\ncommunication, but can be a bit slow. Booking\ncertainly helps, but there are some tables\ndownstairs. You can smoke anywhere and there\nis no dress-code.\nI definetly recommend this place if you are a veggie, and still go if you are not. I award\nVegetarian Cottage 8 out of 10.\nNainish B91 Haverstock Hill, NW3\n071 586 1257\nTube: Belsize Park or Chalk Farm\nIf you've got any recipe ideas drop them into the Felix Office\n\n"

The &Lit Clue\nCoined by Ximenes (see later), the &Lit clue is\none which can be read in two quite different\nways. Firstly, it indicates the answer using any\none of the methods previously described (or\nmore likely a combination) and secondly, it can\nalso be read to be the straightforward definition\nof the answer. A common example is the\n'anagram &Lit' clue:\nWhen un shapely models are employed (6)\nThe anagram of 'models' is SELDOM telling\nus that un shapely models are seldom employed.\n1. How I will be when I find more out (8)\nThe next is a 'last letter &Lit' clue.\n2. Finishes last so keep endings (5)\nThe &Lit clue is not very common but semi-&Lit clues are possible providing they are well\nconstructed and not too obscure.\nLast Words\nAnd so we come to the end of the lessons.\nThe fifteen lessons have covered the main\npoints to be aware of when clue solving but\nthey are not in order of importance. Glancing\nthrough a daily papers' crosswords you should\nCracking Cryptic Crosswords\nat least be able to recognise how a clue should\nbe interpreted if not immediately get the answer.\nIn case you've seen quotations in clues I had better give them a mention. Clues\nconsisting of simple blanks in a quotation, in\nmy opinion, suck. They don't demand any form\nof deduction and either require memory or a book to be solved. Thankfully they are dying out.\nAt the risk of labour inga point, many clues\nare an amalgamation of the techniques that have\nbeen discussed in the lessons. For example, a word might be divided into an anagram and an\nabbreviation:\n3. A dish for the stray pet around the American\ncity (5)\nor instead of an abbreviation, a quirky\ndefinition for a letter (or group of letters)\n4. After midnight, Claire replaced the cold\nsheet(7)\n5. To be indebted to get married after love (4)\nThe Chambers Dictionary contains the best\n(most obscure) definitions and words and has\ntherefore been adopted as the official crossword\ndictionary amongst setters and solvers.\nIf your curiosity has been aroused, I would\nrecommend three books for further reading:\n\u2022Crosswords. How to Solve Them. Ruth Crisp,\nHodder & Stonghton.\n\u2022Chambers Crossword Manual. DS Manley.\n\u2022Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword. DS Macnutt, Methuen & Co Ltd.\nThe first in this list is a handy but very basic\nreference to cryptic crossword puzzling. The\nsecond is an in-depth look at clue compiling\nand solving and contains just about all you\nmight ever need or want to know about cryptic\ncrosswords. It's a good read but is not efficient\nas a reference manual.\nThe last book in the list is a piece of history.\nI mentioned Ximenes earlier. He set the first\nstandards in cryptic clue setting and his book\n(1966) is a fascinating read for the crossword\nenthusiast. He established what he considered\nto be rules of fair-play and most crossword\ncompilers have since conformed to these rules.\nThis book is in the Haldane Library, bless it.\nMost people think of the national\nnewspapers when they think of crosswords and\ncertainly the UK' s press is responsible for\npopularising cryptic crosswords. The standard\nof puzzle does vary between papers but, at the\nsame time, one compiler will write for various\ndifferent papers so it is difficult to tell them\napart.

The Dog It Was That Died is Tom Stoppard's greatest radio play and concerns the chaotic\naftermath of the attempted suicide of a spy. (He\nthrows himself off a bridge at high tide but\nlands on a passing dog which breaks his fall.)\nThe play is a parody of the espionage genre as\nportrayed by Deighton and Le Carre.\nDramsoc hasn't attempted a radio play for\nsome years and we were forced to rediscover\nsome basic recording techniques. But there is no\ndoubt that the result is worth the effort.\nRadio plays have several advantages over\nstage plays: no costumes, props or complicated\nsets; the actors don't have to memo rise their\nlines and new actors, who might be intimidated\nby the stage, can have a go. Of course radio\nplays will not replace the stage, but expect to\nsee (and hear) many more next term and next\nyear.\nAnyone wishing to act in or direct a radio\nplay can contact DramSoc on ext 8719 or IC\nRadio on ext 8710.\nVirgins, Angels\nand Wolves\nThis Monday, ICSF presents a fantasy double\nbill starting at 6pm in Chem Eng LT1.\nThe Princess Bride is a sweet little fairy tale\nabout true love which takes a tongue in cheek\nlook at the usual quest story.

Why not consider a new solution?\nMaharishi Effect: Reduced Conflict in Lebanon\nand Improved Quality of Life in Israel\nTM-Sidhi Program Participants\nFigure 6. This figure illustrates the co variation between the number of TM-Sidhi participants\n(dashes) and a composite index of quality of life in a study conducted in Israel during August and September of 1983. The composite index was the arithmetic average of standardized scores for crime\nrate, traffic accidents, fires, stock market, national mood, and a measure of war intensity in Lebanon.\nThe sociological parameters employed in this study were lodged in advance of the experiment with an\nindependent review board of scientists in the United States and Israel. Transfer function analysis indicated that change in the number of TM-Sidhi participants led change in the composite index b\\ one\nday (t(51)=2.18,p=.017) and by six days (t(51)=1.80,p=.039, one-tailed tests l supporting the\nhypothesis that the TM-Sidhi program caused the reduction in fighting and improved quality of life.\nYes folks! You can create world peace in one\neasy step! That's right, we're talking real world\npeace - no more wars (hot or cold), no arms\nraces, no exploitation, no political tensions, no\nnatural disasters, no crime, accidents or diseases,\nin short, the big Utopia, Heaven on Earth!\nLadies and gentlemen we're talking about an\nend to all suffering of any kind, for our\ngeneration and all our future generations! And\nall you have to do is meditate l Now I have your attention, I urge you to\ntemporarily suspend your disbelief and to read\non. I 'll start again.\nThis article discusses a radical claim. Before\npresenting it, bear in mind that this claim has\nbeen extensively and scientifically verified and\naccepted by a growing number of independent\nacademics and journals. It is as follows: if 1% of\nthe population of a community were to practice a particular type of meditation (called the\nTranscendental Meditation technique or TM for\nshort) or if the square root of 1% were to\nregularly practice the related TM Sid hi programme then 'well-being' will increase, with\ntime, in that community. I use 'well-being' in\nthe broadest possible sense (eg. reduction in\ncrime, suicides, wars etc). 'Community' here\nmeans anything from a village to the world.\n\"Myfirst reaction to work in this tradition was\ntotal disbelief...the technique already has a sounder basis than many less exotic\napproaches...if favourable results keep coming,\nwe should not shrink from using them...\" (Ken\nPease, Professor of Criminology, Manchester\nUniversity and Board Member of the Home\nOffice National Board for Crime Prevention)\nThis, I admit, is a bold claim. I have only\nbeen able to take this claim seriously because\ncareful scrutiny of the studies supporting this\nclaim has led to its acceptance by many\nacademics unconnected with the TM movement\nand to the publication of these studies in a number of widely-respected journals. I think\nthose of us who want to become scientists\nshould have an open mind. In the words of Dr.\nJohn Hassard of the Physics Dept. (with whom I discussed this claim), \"... it is irritating and sad\nthat the knee-jerk reaction of most scientists will\nbe to dismiss these claims without thought, let\nalone experiment. It's a great indictment of the\nscientific approach we're all taught\".\nI will argue below, that if this claim were true\nthen it would be far more than an intellectual\ncuriosity: it would be by far the best way, if not\nthe only way, to save ourselves and the whole\nworld (so it is indeed a very important claim, the\ntruth of which should be examined).\nBefore I go on to explain this claim, I should\ndescribe TM and the TM-Sidhi program. It is\npractised whilst sitting comfortably with the\neyes closed for 20 minutes, twice a day, by\nmillions of people worldwide.\nDon't you have to be a vegan-monk-hermit?\nPractising TM involves no change in lifestyle or\nbeliefs (atheists, agnostics and people from all\nthe major religions practice TM). Unlike many\nmeditation techniques, it requires no effort or\nconcentration whatsoever, so it is enjoyable and\ncan be practised by anybody who has thoughts\nof any kind (i.e. everyone reading this article).\nSounds like airy-fairy-60s nippy-junk!\nOver 500 studies carried out at 210 universities\nand research institutions and published in many\nacademic journals have shown that TM improves the quality of life of it's practitioners.\nThese studies have been collected together in a number of volumes titled Scientific Research on\nMaharishi's Transcendental Meditation and\nTM-Sidhi Programme - anybody interested in\nreading these please contact TMSoc.\nThere is a large body of evidence which\nshows that TM is very effective in improving\nacademic ability, dealing with high blood\npressure, high cholesterol, hypertension, asthma,\ndiabetes, insomnia, angina, weight problems,\ndrug-dependency (booze, fags, illegal and\nmedical drugs), psychiatric illnesses, anxiety,\ndepression, rehabilitation for prisoners and many\nother 'illnesses'. More importantly TM is very\neffective at preventing illness in later life (it has\nalso been recommended by the Health Centre).\nThe TM-Sidhi program is a more advanced\ntechnique that can be learnt any time after the\nfirst two months of being am edit at or. Its effects\nare similar to those of TM, but they work in a more profound way.\nYou can't blind me with pseudoscience!\nIf you want more rig our, then look at the\nhundreds of experiments carried out and\npublished in many leading academic journals\n(which have been collected in the volumes\nmentioned above).\nWhat's all this got to do with Peace?\nI think everyone will agree that there is a lot of\nsuffering in the world (eg. third world debt,\nfascism and civil war, millions are starving and\ndying of disease, my friend lost his favourite pen\n... the list could go on and on...). Whatever we\ndo to try to alleviate it, comparatively little\nchanges overall. The suffering goes on and on. A few people nobly carry on at any cost, with little\nsuccess, but most people, because of\nhopelessness and apathy do very little.\n\"The peer-reviewed literature provides\nstatistically highly significant support for the\nclaim ... These results, which are so completely\ncontrary to one's expectations and yet\npotentially so important, should be approached\nwith an open mind, and further studies by\nindependent researchers should be supported to\ncheck and explore the effect.\" (James Lawton,\nVisiting Professor of Chemical Engineering,\nImperial College)\nUntil they find out about the Maharishi\nEffect. This phenomenon, named after Maharishi\nwho predicted it some 30 years ago, has been\nstudied extensively for the past two decades.\nJournals including Yale University's Journal of\nThis week's Restaurant Reviews are on page 4\n\n"

    "content": "Feature S In April 1993, following MPG approval, the College\nplaced a contract with Ericsson Ltd for the supply of a new digital telephone exchange and the total re cabling of\nall buildings on the South Kensington site.\nWork started on cabling in May 1993 and the new\nsystem will be ready for service on 29th April 1994, at\nwhich time it can be used for internal calls and incoming\ncalls to DDI (direct line) extensions.\nThe new system will then run in parallel with the old\nsystem for eight weeks to allow for familiaris ation, testing and user training. The new system will be brought\ninto full operation on Saturday 25th June and the old\nsystem decommissioned. Until 24th June all calls to TI\n071 589 5111 will be received on the old system and all\noutgoing external calls will continue to be made on the\nold system. From 25th June 071 589 5111 will be\nreceived on the new system and the lines will be opened\nfor outgoing traffic.\nDuring the parallel running period, staff will have\nboth the new and old handsets on their desks and will be\nencouraged to use the new system for internal calling and\nmake use of their DDI facility. It will not be possible to\nmake a call from a new extension to an old one. The new\nsystem will be brought into service with over 38,000\nextensions, 8,000 more than currently exist, with\nsignificant growth potential for the future.\nHave We Got Your Number?\nmm u.:_... \u2022 .ij lF Phoneday - National Code Change\nThe national code change day is on 16th April 1995. this\nis the day that the whole country will have the digit '1'\nplaced after the leading zero in all dialling codes e.g.071 will become 0171. In actual fact the new London codes\nwill be operational sometime in the April of this year\nwith official parallel running of both old an new STD\ncodes starting on 1st August 1994. Due to lack of\navailable telephone numbers, six cities are being given\nnew codes and the international access code will change\nfrom 010 to 00 in line with most European countries.\nIt is probably better to assume that the new codes are\neffective from August this year and remember that 16th April 1995 is the day that the old codes stop working.\nThis is an important point to note if you publish existing\nDDI numbers. Therefore any advanced literature,\npublications, stationery etc could accommodate any of\nthe new DDI numbers and the national code change to\navoid the need to change these twice.\nIf you have any queries now please contact the\nTelecom project office on extension 8582.\n\u2022\nWhat type of extension do you have?\nThe new five-digit extension numbers will start with a4 or a5. If your number begins with a4, you have a DDI\nfacility and external callers can dial you direct to the\ndesk bypassing the telephone operator. To use this\nfacility you must prefix your number with 017159. So, if\nyou extension is 48000 then external callers can reach\nyou by dialling 0171 594 8000. However, if you number\nbegins with a5 you do not have this facility and external\ncallers can only contact you via the operator on 0171 589\n5111. Each department appointed a representative to\nassign extension numbers, user facilities and provide\ninformation for the new telephone directory.\nThe new telephone directory will be available at the\nend of April and is designed as an interim measure for\nthe new system and to see us through the following six\nmonths. A directory will continue to be compiled\nthroughout the summer. When the directory is\ndistributed, if you entry is missing or incorrect please let\nthe Switchboard Supervisor, on 49897, know as well as\nyour departmental representative.\nYou've finally remembered\neveryone's phone numbers.\nThen they\ndecide to\nchange them\nall.\nThe last part of Cracking Cryptic Crosswords is on the back page\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 15\nThere's a time towards the end of term when I desire to head out over the water to a bigger,\nbetter life. So lasso your stetson s as we take a view of the latest releases from Stateside bands.\nRed Red Meat sound as raw as the ribs they\ntake their name from. Inhabiting the stomping\nground of the southern boogie rodeos, they\nmight have recorded 'Jimmywine Majestic' in a garage but more likely it was a barbecue. With\ntitles as nonsensical as 'Gorshin', 'Cillamange'\nand 'Smokey Mountain d bl. Dip', the songs\nthemselves are so relaxed that on occasions they\nseem to fall over through lack of momentum.\nBut sometimes you need to listen to music\nwhich is made just because the band have it in\ntheir blood, not because they have anything\nparticular to say. The xerox ed lyric sheet is\nwithout punctuation, the cover artistically\nweary; this will be a well loved album. (8)\nAnother juicy morsel is Flop's 'Whenever\nYou're Ready'. Their gig is reviewed so I won't say too much about them, the album's still only\navailable on import. Yet it crackles with a heart\nand heads into places that are presently\nun reached, Pavement having gone straight. (7)\nCamille goes all philosophical about the\nGolden Palominos' new album. \" A dreamy\nsnapshot of existential uncertainty, 'This is How\nit Feels' is crystallised with the most\nimaginative of beats. Imprinted on this is Loni\nCarson's siren-like vocals but rather than\nleading gullible seamen to destruction, it tempts\ntowards transcendence. This isn't purely about\nabandoning the sensual for the spiritual; no way.\n'Prison of the Rhythm' explicitly revels in those\nmost unrestrained of moments and also alludes\nto those times when mind and body come to\ndisturbingly different conclusions.\" (7)\nMr Happy is smiling about Common\nLanguage's 'Flesh Impact'. The band who \"go\nevery morning to their local diner...the one used\nin Twin Peaks.\" Another case of some damn\nfine pie. \"Considering they come from Seattle,\nthis is remarkably original. They are one of the\nfew all women bands who haven't jumped on\nthe grunge or fox core bandwagon.\" (7)\nBefore we go there are some singles to tickle\nyour anvils. Like Madder Rose and 'Panic On'.\nAlthough by no means an obvious single,\nguitars still manage to puncture the light headed\naction, as ever. Of better worth is Jale. Their\n'Promise/3 Days' sees incessant guitars gear up\nand down as the girls reign in over the top. This\nis a neat entrance. Swell are telling us to 'Forget\nabout Jesus'. \"Deep, melodic and powerful - a must for anyone seriously interested in decent\nindie\" says an irreligious Pear. And finally\nNatacha Atlas and 'Dub Yulla' brings us home.\n\" A journey through Middle-Eastern and Asian\ncultures to stunning effect. Global fusion is\nbecoming a very interesting prospect.\" Camille.\nGoodbye dear friends. Until next week. Tintin\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nElvis Costello\nBrutal Youth\nAlways knew it. We're all living in the past.\nObvious, but true. If it isn't Primal Scream and\ntheir turgid Rolling Stones wannabe then it's SMASH feigning the Buzzcocks (without\nhaving either syllable). And now Elvis Costello\ncoaxes the Attractions back into the studio. Hey\nPresto! it's1977 and Virginia's won Wimbledon.\nNot content to rest there, he calls the album\n'Brutal Youth'. Yeah, it was my youth and I feel\nbeaten and bruised. All the milestones of my\npost-pubescent angst have been rewritten, if not\nin name then nature, for another generation of\nwhich I am not a part.\nAND, AND, AND...the worst thing is I'm going to love and treasure this album as much as\nI do the rest of my Costello collection, which is\na sad indictment of me and the rest of us who\nwill be queuing on the steps of the Albert Hall\nhoping to recapture that which was lost.\nMaybe Elvis has decided to rekindle this old\nflame before somebody creates 'Oliver's Barmy\nArmy', a Costello tribute band. I hope so and I hope he's not just playing on people's nostalgic\npropensities; too much of that stuff around. But\nas I was saying, always knew it. We're all living\nin the past. Pass me the knife before I turn into\nKaren Carpenter. (8) Davros C. Dick\n1\ntin IV.11 Morrissey\nVauxhall and I 'Vauxhall and I' is a record that almost jangles\nwith smugness. Gone is the polemic bar racking and the an the mic slogan ising that characterises\nthe body of Morrissey's previous work.\nChanting his words of wisdom to his minions of\nbe qu if fed sycophants obviously holds less of a thrill for him than it once did. He appears to\nhave grasped the concept that playing to the\ngallery is all very well in itself, but any intention\nto move out from beneath the shadow of 'This\nCharming Man' will take a little more than\nliterary masturbation. This he achieved to some\nextent with 'Your Arsenal' and so could\napproach 'Vauxhall and I' with a certain glow\nthat only appears when the world is not only\nexpectant but at your feet.\nThis is commercial, accessible and user\nfriendly. A pop product that should be all things\nto all people...but then I have always been\nsomething of a be qu if fed sycophant. Pass the\nDaffs, David! (8) Steven Patrick Glyph\nom Flop, Magnapop and the Posies\nLondon Astoria 2\nFor a band who have tracks titled; 'En Route to\nthe Final Unified Field Theory' and 'Mendel's Whitetrash Laboratory', Flop are an Imperial\nm uso's dream. On the stage, the lads crank up\nand let rip with false endings built into heavy\nchord whippings. Unfortunately the more\ndelicate vocal tendrils of their album weren't seen in the mosh but there's night and day.\nThen Magnapop bounce onto play. They're\ngoing to enjoy themselves if it means forcing us\nall to enjoy ourselves too. When the bassist loses\nhis noise, he gets on down too. The night's only\nstage-diver and he's going in the wrong direction.\nMaybe they're a bit hit and miss, but friendly\nAmericans who join in their own show, change\ntheir set list at the drop of a heckle, then hand\nout the now redundant lists to the crowd are\nsomething not to be taken lightly.\nYes, I know that the Posies aren't cool. And\nyes, I know that they're being sold over here as\nsome Uncle Sam version of Teenage Fanclub.\nSo how come I like them so much?\nWell maybe it's got something to do with\ntheir anti-rock star demean our and the general 'I actually want to be here' expression on their\nbeaming faces. Then again, it could be because\nlead singer Jon seems to have finally realised\nthat he's a Posie rather than a poseur and instead\nleaves pop delicacies like 'Dream All Day' to\nspeak for themselves. And the fact that they\neschew the pretence of encore-dom to jam until\nthe LA2 management gets twitch y probably\nhelps too, right? Vik - Posies, Tintin - the rest.\nI don't mind being blind so long as someone out there can see\n\n"

    "content": "I Feature\nJohn walked slowly along Queen's Gate,\npondering the many basic questions of life; why\nare we here? Is there life after death? And, above\nall, what on Earth was he doing trekking to the\nHuxley Building at 9 o 'clock in the morning?\nHe noticed little as he walked robotic ally towards the entrance. The unusual preponderance\nof tourists was not in itself surprising - someone\nwas probably just selling the Americans real IC\nUnion sausage rolls with Union Jacks stuck on\nthem. The blood which was gently seeping out of\nthe windows and down the walls, however, may\nhave made a more weak-willed student\nsuspicious.\nNot even John's almost legendary lack of\nobservational skills could deny that something\nwas definitely wrong when he entered the\nbuilding. As alarm bells made a noise\nsomewhere between an evacuate signal and the\nhallelujah chorus, his first instinct was,\nnaturally, to jump for the lift. Which he did. (As\nevery good student knows, safety regulations\nwere invented by communist dictators who\nwanted to suppress the masses and probably\nstudied economics.) At this point something\neerily unnatural happened - the lift was already\non his floor! Curiosity aroused, he entered (or\nrather fell in) and pressed the button marked ten.\n\"Bloody physicists,\" he muttered.\nNow, whilst it is perfectly normal to blame\nphysicists for anything from the price of lager to\nthe price of bitter with little apparent reason, in\nthis case John was correct. What he didn't know\nwas that, due to a rather dangerous experiment\nconducted by a physics professor (involving a tweed jacket and an attempt to tell a joke), a massive temporal anomaly had occurred on floor\n6M. This resulted both in the death of everyone\nin the building and (slightly more seriously) the\ndestruction of the nice shiny 'Conference\nCentre' signs that had just been installed.\nMore by luck than judgement, John had, in\nfact, chosen the perfect place to hide; not many\npeople know this, but lifts already exist in an\nalternative plane of reality (Huxley's lifts are\nabout one foot below ours) and are thus immune\nfrom temporal anomalies on other planes.\nThe lift creaked and screeched as it dragged\nits way up the shaft, giving John a sense of\nfamiliar security. As the doors slid open four\nfeet below the relevant floor, it was as if nothing\nhad changed. He scrambled up the lift shaft and\nstood panting in the corridor. After a few\nseconds, he realised this was not his floor.\n\"Oh, Bugger,\" he said, which was, perhaps,\nnot the most original thought, but it did seem to\nsum things up. John noticed that all the crimson\nstreams of blood in this corridor appeared to be\nflowing in a similar direction. So (through one\nof those strange deductive processes that also\ncause people to enter the basement armed with a penknife when there is a lunatic wielding a hatchet down there) John decided to follow it.\nTowards the end of the corridor a river of\nblood slowed and began to congeal, forming a soup Linstead Hall would've been proud to\nserve. The soup gently lapped against a closed\ndoor which was marked 'WARNING: CLASS 1\nBORE' and 'Physicists do it with accelerators'.\nJohn tentatively placed his hand on the door\nhandle, and turned...\nAt this point, it is probably worth explaining\nexactly what had caused the temporal anomaly.\nWhilst sitting in his office poring over a particularly poor student's paper, the tweed\njacketed professor (who shall remain nameless\nin the interests of the reputation of the College,\nnot to mention the tailors) thought of, what can\nonly be described as, a hilarious joke (seemingly\na first for a physicist). Pausing only to develop a new unit (and symbol) for humour, be dragged\nhis beleaguered PhD student into the room.\n\"What,\" he said, \"do you get when you cross\na physicist with a biologist?\"\nAt this point Reality was already showing the\nsigns of stress associated with a physicist (an IC\nprofessor, no less) attempting to tell a joke. \" A biophysicist?\" ventured the student.\nAt this point, Reality decided it would be best\nif it had a quiet sit down in a darkened room.\n\"No, you fool,\" (professors always have the\nutmost respect for their students). \"It's... oh sod\nit! Now where did I write it down...\"\nReality, which had put up with more than its\nfair share of trouble lately, decided that its only\nrecourse was a couple of Valium and a quick dose\nof shock treatment. The pile of paperwork that\npassed for a filing system immediately concluded\nthat the biggest shock it could muster would be\nto turn into a black hole. This was almost entirely\nat odds with the fact that the pile, although\ncopious, weighed only about one kilogram.\nNevertheless, it made a pretty good effort and\nmanaged, by dint of Reality's impromptu\nholiday, to create not a black hole but more of a black rip. In the absence of anyone to repair the\nrip, this would have to suffice.\nAll was not entirely well, however; with\nReality having decided it needed a holiday, Time\nwas getting itchy feet as well. Now, as legal\neagles will know, Time is contractually obliged\nto carry on working. After some examination of\nthe small print in the contract, Time realised that\nnowhere did it mention which direction it had to\ngo in. After a bit of thought (and a few attempts\nat going sideways) it decided that backwards\nwas as good a way to unwind as any.\nAnyway, John's hand had by now more or\nless completely turned the door handle. He\npulled and was confronted by something more\ndreadful than anything else he had ever seen!\nCould it possibly be...Jimmy Tarbuck! Clearly,\nthe extent to which Time and Reality were in\ntrouble had been underestimated by all.\nConfronted by anything as terrifying as\nJimmy Tarbuck, many students would run to\ntheir nearest Neo-Marxists For Chicken Rights\nSociety for refuge. John, however, was a computing student made of sterner stuff, and\nthus devastating ly bad taste was normal for him.\nClearly, the situation demanded action. The\nfirst action which came to John's mind was\npurchasing a stiff drink (in situations like these,\neven the Union bar is appealing). John had to\nface the fact that drowning in alcohol wasn't going to rid the world of Tarby, so something a little more substantial was going to be required.\nCuriously, Tarby appeared to be stuck in an\ninfinite loop, reciting \"What do you get when\nyou cross a physicist...\" over and over again. In\na sudden flash of inspiration, it occurred to John\nthat if he could provide a punchline for the joke,\nthe anomaly would be resolved and the world (or\nHuxley building) would be saved.\nWhilst simple in principle, this would\nnormally have been something of a problem for\nJohn. As has been mentioned, John was a computing student and computing students only\nrecognise jokes that have been circulating on the\nnetworks for two or three years at least. Luckily,\nphysicists suffer from a similar lack of\nimagination. The joke which the professor\nclaimed to have invented was thus one which\nJohn had heard before. Taking a deep breath, he\nuttered the magic words...\nAt this point, Reality gradually came round\nand wondered groggily what in God's name it\nhad done in the void which constituted its\nmemory of the past few hours and prayed that if\nit didn't know, no one else did either. Time\nrealised that, however dull its life may have\nbeen, nothing was bad enough to warrant\nresurrecting Tarbuck and concluded that maybe\nthe old days were in fact better after all. (This is\nthe kind of conclusion that only Time itself can\nreach with any sort of authority.)\n...The shimmery image of Tarby immediately\nimploded, drawing a vast wave of normality into\nits place. The rivers of blood swirled around and\nwere sucked into the rip which then sealed itself\nin a flash of near blinding light.\nLooking slightly bewildered, John walked\nback to the lift and pressed the 'down' button.\nAfter five minutes, the lift finally arrived and he\nfell into the lift (which was, typically, one foot\nbelow floor level). Things were back to normal.\n\"Bloody physicists...\"\nTim Walls\nIf you've got anything suitable for Cat's Tale, please let us know\n\n"

    "content": "14 Reviews\nThe Bacchae The Flag\nThe women of Thebes have broken their bonds.\nPossessed by the god Dionysus (also called\nBacchus - the Bacchae being his devotees) they\ncavort half-naked around the mountain slopes,\ncommuning with the birds and the beasts. King\nPentheus is outraged by the immorality of these\ngoings-on - his own mother and aunts in the\nlead - started by this new 'god' and his wine-induced ecstasies. The truth is that Dionysus\nhimself is in Thebes, come for revenge against\nthe royal family of his mortal mother (Zeus\nbeing his father) who will not honour his god-hood.\nThe role of Pentheus can be played different\nways, ranging between cruel, repressive ruler\nkeeping 'moral' order by force, or, as in this\nproduction, a young, inexperienced king\ndestroyed by the wrath of a 'young and\ninexperienced' god whose lust for revenge is not\nworthy of a god. Either way, Pentheus cannot\nresist the invitation of Dionysus to take a peep\nat the Bacchic rites that may not be seen by\noutsiders...You can guess some of the rest. This\nis, after all, Greek Tragedy. But the sheer\ninhumanity of the god's revenge has an\nundiminished power to shock.\nThe theatre is a tiny in-the-round space,\nallowing only minimal 'production', which is a great relief. Classical Greek theatre is not drama\nin the modern sense: it relies on the text and the\nefficacy of its delivery. The ever-present\nChorus, commenting on and (unlike other\nclassical plays) participating in the action, is\nperhaps the crux of a successful production of\nthis play,and it was played quite well; I hope it\nwill improve with more performances. I would\nquestions, though, the Godspell-like singing of\nthe Chorus, which is out of context: the rites of\nDionysus have little in common with the\nmeekness of Christianity.\nPlinthos\nThe Courtyard Theatre, 10 York Way. 071 833\n0870. Tube: Kings Cross. Tickets \u00a36.50 (Cones\n\u00a35) plus 50p membership. Tue-Sun, 8pm. Until\n25th March.\nTonight is the launch of Corin and Vanessa\nRedgrave's Moving Theatre venture. This foray\ninto fringe is opened with Alex Ferguson's The\nFlag and appropriately cropped dramatic\nproduction of Robert Shaw's novel.\nSet in the fictional East-Anglican town of\nEastwold, a newly-appointed left-wing vicar,\nJohn Calvin, starts to work on preaching his\nrevolutionary ideas. But the conservative\ncommunity are resistant to change and the\ninevitable conflict occurs; he is besieged both at\nhome and from within the church. Timewise, it\nis set in 1926 and the echo from the General\nStrike is felt through Calvin. Ultimately it is\ntragic, but interestingly this has more symbolic\nsignificance than melodramatic implication.\nCorin Redgrave, as the ironically named\nChristian Socialist (cf. Jean Calvin), is slightly\ndisappointing; though expressing a range of\nemotion, it is perhaps understated and lacks the\nzealous fer v our of the man-with-a mission.\nContributing to the occasionally lewd and\nbawdy atmosphere, war-torn minds of the\nhomeless are brought in and give the play the\nedge of social realism; Stewart Howson,\nparticularly, as the aptly-named Screever is\nawesome; dripping confused menace, his knife-wielding antics are memorable.\nAlongside other moments of supreme sobriety\nand seriousness, the touches of satire are comic\nand entertaining, especially Jennifer Hilary's confident and exhilarating performance as the\nsexually charged Lady Cynthia Cleeve. Dressed\nas if to do the Charleston, she adds vital colour to\nthe wooden beams of the minimalist set.\nOverall Corin Redgrave and Gillian\nHambleton's direction is excellent and gets a thumbs up from a converted music scribe.\nCamille\nBridge Lane Theatre, Bridge Lane SW11. 071\n228 8828.

Ends 2nd April.\nWaiting for Godot\nWhen entering the Lyric Studio for a production\nof Waiting for Godot, one must leave behind\none's yearning for definitions. In order to revel\nin the elemental experience of Samuel Beckett's stage-world.\nThe tension between a recognition of the\nfutility of life and a desperate writhing in the\nshadow of this knowledge enables the characters\nto endure in their senseless vigil. However,\ndiversion in the hands of so great a dramatist\nassumes chilling poetic significance.\nIt is this constant, disquieting comment that\nseemed insufficiently suggested in this\npresentation by Efendz Productions. However,\nthis does not prevent enjoyment of dynamic\nperformances with delicious comic insight and,\nin the case of Lucky, a brilliant creation of\nappallingly pathetic human frailty.\nSetting the play amid sound enshrouded\nplains lent something to the mysticism of the\nnightly visits - exquisitely done here - but,\nbesides this, the play refused to be limited by\ngeography.\nThus, fired by the evening's experience, one\ncan burrow its significance at leisure or forget\nall about it. Either way, time continues to spill\nnoiselessly away.\ni qq y Lyric Theatre, Kings St, W6 081 471 8701.\nTube: Hammersmith.

    "content": "Reviews 17\ntl MMM mr ii THE EARLY YEARS Genius or charlatan? Dali on trial. Salvador Dalf\nwas the mou s tachi oed master of un forgotten dreams, he was the psychologist of your fears\nand loves. His posters adorn a frightening\nnumber of student walls; and not just posters of\nthe art, but also of the man himself. Dalf's self-styled eccentricities foreshadow every one of his\nworks, the waxed curls of his sub-nasal growth\nstride forth before his art like the motorcycle\noutriders on Kennedy's motorcade. Unlike\nKennedy however, the eyes are not on the\nsplattered brains of Dalf's paintings but on the\nman himself. Was he really a genius? To\ncelebrate the Hayward Gallery's celebration of\nDalf's early life, we put the 'artist' on trial.\nBy the age of 23, Dali had become known\nthroughout the art world, but not as a surrealist. In\nfact he was painting in every style but surrealism.\nHe could sketch with the skill of the Renaissance\nmasters, he understood the colourful swirls of the\nimpressionists, he was even a greater cubist than\nPicasso when he wished. In fact he had the\ntechnical ability to paint in any style he wanted -but he had set out to be a genius, so he needed a style of his own. Even during these early years,\nDalf's personality burned through his works - self\nportraits abound and personal symbols are\neverywhere (he even appropriated Picasso's guitars and violins, only to violate and abuse them\nin mock deference to his mediocre compatriot).\nAll of a sudden, things\nstarted to change. Dali\ndiscovered a new tool by\nwhich to express his\npersonality: surrealism.\nWith his incomparable\ntechnical ability and\nperverse imagination he\nstarted to create the\ncomplex metamorphic\nimages for which he is\nfamed. Each of his early\nsurrealist works was a complex inter-play of\ndream, biography and idea,\nwith objects dissolving\ninto landscapes or into\neach other. Grotesque\nsexuality and putrefaction\nare recurrent themes, along \u00a7\nwith the distorted image of\nthe artist, portrayed as\n'The Great Masturbator'.\nAt this point, Dalf's personality was finally\novertaken by his skill as a painter - people were\nlooking at the art and not at\nhim. He was still there on\nthe canvasses, but was\ntrapped within a complex visual code of symbols\nwhich echo through his pictures, a code which noone could dare hope to solve. Ants, keys, fingers\nand sexual organs, lions and tigers and bears, oh\nmy. It seems Dali did not style his personality to\nmarket his paintings but the other way around; his\nart was merely a tool to sell his soul. He lost out\nin the end simply because his paintings were too\ngood. People kept the art and forgot about him.\nWas Dali a genius? Who cares. He set out to\nA detail from 'The Font' by Salvador Dali.\nconvince the world that he was and he\nsucceeded. Whether there is a charlatan behind\nthe myth doesn't matter, because the man died\nand only the myth remains. Go see it while you\ncan.\nMA Hayward Gallery, South Bank. Tube: Waterloo.\n\u00a33.50 students (Also admits you to 'Unbound -New Possibilities in Painting') Runs until 30th May.\nMurder, Mud and the Millenium\nAfter a disappointing Rigoletto last month, the\nRoyal Opera's revival of Verdi's Un Ballo in\nMaschera is a welcome success; a team effort\nwithout a weak link in the cast.\nThe Italian censors objected to the first\nversion of Verdi's plot, fearing that an opera\nabout the assassination of royalty might give\nideas to the republicans. King Gustavus III\ntherefore had to become the Governor of Boston.\nThe original setting, restored here as is now\ncommon, is 18th century Sweden, although the\nstory of love, honour and vendetta is typically\nItalian. Daniele Gatti conducts with care for his\nsingers, but pulls no punches at the big\nmoments.\nAlso at the Royal Opera, there's still time to\ncatch Janacek's Katya Kabanovd on the 22nd and 25th March. Maria Bj0rnson's swirled-mud\nset is perfect for the surreal and tragic third act,\nbut for financial, or perhaps technical, reasons\nwe have to put up with it for the first two acts as\nwell. Bernard Haitink draws playing of great\nsensuousness from his orchestra.\nIt seems that as the Towards the Millenium\nseries moves further into unknown territory,\naudience interest is beginning to wane. Standby\ntickets were being offered for last week's City of\nBirmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO)\nconcert at the Royal Festival Hall, but the large\nswathes of empty seats deemed unavailable by\nthe box office suggest that someone is lashing\nout unwanted complement aries like there's no\ntomorrow. Growing indifference from the press\nis perhaps due to the fact that there is little else\nto do but heap praise on Simon Rattle and his\nextraordinarily fine orchestra. After a slightly\nsaccharine account of Berg's Violin Concerto,\nRattle and the CBSO gave a performance of\nShostakovich's Fourth Symphony that matched\nanything I 've ever heard for precision and\ngripping intensity. Catch them next Friday in\nStravinsky and Walton.\nAnd talking of the Millenium series, I was at\nAndrew Davis's performance of Lulu last\nSunday in Birmingham's Symphony Hall. Just\nfor the record, it was tremendous.\nPatrick Wood\nRoyal Opera House. Tube: Covent Garden.\n071 240 1066.\nRoyal Festival Hall.

The reason for this is that there will\nbe more extensive coverage in next week's issue.

With\nregards to the elections, I feel that it is wrong for\nthe media to be biased towards any candidate\nduring an election and, in this respect, I agreed\nwith our President's request not to publicise\nNew Election above any other candidate.\nWith hindsight, maybe Felix should have\npromoted New Election more than it did, but\ndoing this and remaining unbiased isn't easy. It\nis ultimately the job of the Returning Officer and\nthe Elections Committee to publicise all this.\nSurely New Election should have had posters up\nlike each of the other candidates. It's been done\nin the past. The Committee has a budget with\nwhich to do it.\nFelix certainly isn't Mr Wensley's propaganda machine - we are there to report on what\nis going on.

The\nChair of the Sri Lankan Society confirmed with\nme last week that signing the letter as being the\nviews of the Sri Lankan Society was OK. I did\ncheck this on more than one occasion during the\nconversation. I did not, however, ask whether\nthe letter had been checked with the entire of the\nSri Lanka Society committee.\nI assume that the Chair of a society has\nenough common sense to check with the\nnecessary people before agreeing to something\non behalf of a society. I do not have the time to\nmake sure a letter has been checked with every\nmember of a society's committee before\naccepting it.\nAs for the general Sri Lanka/Tamil debate\nwhich is occupying part of the letters pages, I hope that this doesn't reach the extent of the\nIslam debate. As Marcus put in his letter, \"it\nwould be much better if we could see the Tamils\nand Sri Lankans of this College shaking hands\nand settling their disputes...\", but what seems to\nbe happening is more letters and the arguments\ngoing round and round in circles.\nI am not against debate on the letters page, I just don't want the same groups disagreeing\nover the same points every week.

Do you\nthink you could run an existing activity better?\nIs there something you would like to change?\nThere's a chance coming up soon...\nImperial College Union needs strong student\nofficers to serve the student body properly and\neffectively. The sabbatical officers work with a number of other student officers who help to run\nand organise all the Union's activities.\nA list of the positions available and a bit\nabout what each of them involves can be found\nin the box next to this article. These student\nofficers are elected at a General Meeting of the\nUnion. The next one of these will be held on the\nlast day of this term, 25th March at l pm in the\nEnts Lounge, ground floor of the Union\nBuilding.\nIf you want to know any more about any of\nthese nine posts, simply contact the Union\nOffice, first floor of the Union Building and ask\nto speak to any of the sabbaticals. They'll be\nhappy to fill you in on what the post entails.\nIf you want to stand for election, you have to\nget yourself nominated. For this, you need a proposer and ten second ers. The nomination\npapers are put on the board opposite the Union\nOffice.\nJust to remind you, the elections will take\nplace at the Union General Meeting, l pm,25 th March, in the Ents Lounge.\nAcademic Affairs Officer\nThis officer has the responsibility of coordinating the academic affairs activities within the Union.\nBy working with the Academic Affairs Officers of the CCUs and the Dep Reps, you help solve\nstudents problems and bring to the Union's attention problems that departments may be facing.\nAccommodation Officer\nThe Accommodation Officer works to improve the accommodation facilities of Imperial students,\nboth inside and outside of College.

Working with the Ents\nCommittee, you can organise discos, club nights, comedy evenings, carnivals, the choice is yours.\nRag Chair\nThe Rag Chair and the Rag Committee organise the year's rag events from collections to Tiddlywinks, from rag raids to Rag Week.

Good communications skills is needed as well as a spot of diplomacy at times!\nWelfare Officer\nThe Welfare Officer represents student interests on welfare issues. The post also involves\nresearching problems that students experience while at College, working to find solutions,\nbringing them to the attention of the Union and College so that they can be resolved.\nWomen's Officer\nThe Women's Officer exists to further the interests of female students at Imperial College.\nCommunity Action Group Chair\nThis posts runs the Community Action Group of Imperial College Union.\nA Safe Way Home For All\nAre you fed up having to take a taxi home after kicking-out time at the\nUnion? Then maybe the Union has a solution . ..\nIf you live in Southside then you are lucky, at\nleast as far as getting home after a late Union\nevent is concerned. Even for residents of Evelyn\nGardens it isn't too much of a problem - there\nare usually several people going the same way,\nand it's not too far - it's a surmountable distance\neven when you've indulged in the goodies of the\nbar. However, especially for female students\nliving further afield, there is often no option than\nto take a taxi home after the tube has closed.\nBecause of this there has been a free minibus\nservice for women after certain Union events.\nThe cost of this service has meant that it does not\nrun very often and is not available for men, even\nfor those prone to being molested, for whatever\nreason.\nNow, the idea is to set up a minibus service\navailable to all members of the Union after\nUnion events lasting past midnight. Users of the\nservice will be charged an affordable fee to\nmaintain the service (to help cover payment of\nthe driver and petrol costs). People would sign\nup during the evening, giving their destination.\nThe minibus will deliver single female\npassengers to the door and wait until they are\nsafely inside. Other users (including\naccompanied women) will be dropped close to\nhome, at locations which take the other\ndestinations into account. Depending on how\ncomplicated it becomes, this service might be\nrestricted to areas more highly populated with\nstudents.\nThe price of this service will probably depend\non the distance, i.e. if you live further away you\nwill have to pay more. At present it is not yet\nknown exactly how the costs will be split up.\nFor the rest of the year, starting from the end-of-term carnival next week, a trial minibus\nservice will be run on Fridays and any deficits\nwill be covered by the Women's Officer budget.\nThis will give us an idea of how to run such a service. If the scheme is successful, we might be\nable to extend it to include Wednesday nights.\nICU's Postgraduate Affairs Officer, Margie\nBell, told me about the 'walk-home' service she\nsupervised in her final year at Queen's University (Kingston, Ontario). I outlined the\nscheme in the last Women's Officer report; it\nseems to be highly successful (it had been\nrunning for five years when Margie managed it).\nHowever, considering the low female\npercentage, the early library closing times, the\nrelative safety of South Kensington and the\ninfamous apathy of Imperial College students, it\nseems rather idealistic to set up a similar system\nhere.\nIf you think that there is a safety problem,\nplease do contact me. Until then;\nLook out for the first run of the minibus\nservice at the Carnival next Friday!\nKristine J Vaaler, ICU Women's Officer\nThere is a UGM on Friday 25th March, 1pm in the Ents Lounge\n\n"

A Pentel box as a bed and bountiful\nsupplies of blu-roll enabled him to\nlive a life of considerable luxury.\nHowever, his true status as life president of Felix was proved when he\ngraduated to an enormous, palatial\ncage. Us hacks were truly scared of\nhim - the grisly demise of the cage's former owner was never reported.\nI never saw Whiskas during the\nday - no bad thing as dispatches say\nhe was nocturnal. Most, indeed all,\nnews stories were written to the sweet\naccompaniment of crunching\nsunflower seeds, sucking sounds from\nthe water bottle and mouse pee.\nSometimes he was let out into the\ncommunity, allowed to roam over\ndesks and stand as a sabbatical\ncandidate. His bid for stardom was\nthwarted by mere pedants.

    "content": "Feature 1\nConflict Resolution (reputedly the world's leading journal in the field of peace studies) and\nSocial Indicators Research (one of the most\nstatistically rigorous journals in the social\nsciences) have published studies showing that\nthe Maharishi Effect works. Not surprisingly, the\njuries from these journals were very sceptical of\nthe research. Despite this, fourteen studies have\nbeen accepted to date, either at conferences or in\njournals. It is the only technique for creating\n'well-being' that has been reproduced with\n100% success in widely varying environments.\nIt is very easy, very cheap and very peaceful to\nexecute.\n\"...the claim can be plausibly made that the\npotential impact of this research exceeds that of\nany other on-going social or psychological\nresearch programme. The research has survived\na broader array of statistical tests than most\nresearch in the field of conflict resolution... \"\n(David Edwards, Professor of Government, Texas University)\nStudies show that there are reductions in\ncrime, war deaths, terrorism, traffic fatalities, air\ntraffic fatalities, infectious diseases, un employ ment, and inflation at local, national and international levels. The statistical probability that\nthe results of all these studies taken together are\njust a coincidence and not related to TM has\nbeen calculated to be 10 (assuming that all the\nstudies are independent of one another).\nSo what?\nSo what? Take crime. The government spends\nhundreds of millions of pounds on different\nschemes, and crime is still on the increase. It is\ncompletely illogical to expect those schemes\nwhich have consistently failed in the past to\nsuddenly be successful now. The Maharishi\nEffect has been consistently successful in\nreversing crime increases, and the cost of its\nimplementation for the whole of Britain is\nnegligible.\nWhat's it got to do with met\nAnyone who thinks \"I'm alright Jack!\" may be\n'alright' now, but what about the future? The\nworld is changing fast. In just the last decade the\nCold War ended faster than most people\nexpected. Who knows what will happen next?\nJust because we've had it 'easy' in Britain it\ndoesn't mean it'll carry on being that way. If\nanyone cares for no one except themselves, then\nthey should try to create peace, for their own\nsake. Perhaps Britain should look to\nMozambique, where the army was recently\ntrained in the TM-Sidhi programme in order to\ncombat civil war and where, interestingly\nenough, the civil war quickly ended.\nI'm still very sceptical\nI hope that I 've convinced the reader of how\nimportant it is to investigate the claims of the\nTM-movement. It is very hard to believe in these\nclaims because they seem ridiculous. However,\none cannot ignore the very compelling empirical\nresults. Also, it is worth remembering that all\nrevolutions in thought are hard to accept (it\nseems obvious to us that the Sun is at the centre\nof the Solar System, but it took a very long time\nfor people to accept this). Finally, part of the\nclaim is that if enough people all over the world\ndo meditate in large enough groups (and it really\nisn't that many people) then in a very real sense,\nthey will create real and lasting world peace.\nThis would be the most significant event in\nrecorded human history.\nIf you want to find out more about the 'how\nand why' of the Maharishi Effect, then please\ncome to Mech Eng Rm 220 on Mon 21st March\nat l pm, where Charles Cunningham, a qualified\nTM instructor, will give a talk on TM and the\nMaharishi Effect. For more information about\nTMSoc you can contact the secretary, Yasir\nHassan (that's me), Physics UG4 through my\npigeon hole or by email on Y. Hassan\u00ae\nph.ic.ac.uk.\nI'd like to thank Dr. John Hassard and I'd also\nlike to thank everyone who read this for their\nhelpful advice. Naturally, I take full\nresponsibility for the opinions and facts\npresented. Finally, I'd also like to thank Felix\nfor printing this article.\nMaharishi Effect: Decreased Crime in U.S. Cities\nImmediate Crime Rate Change\nin 1973\np<.002 Change in Crime Rate Trend\nFrom 1967-1972\nvs. 1972-1977\n<.02\n1 % Cities\nN=24 Control Cities\nN=24 Figure 1. Cities in which 1\n% of the population had been instructed in the Transcendental Meditation\nprogram by 1972 displayed decreased crime rate during the next year (1973) and decreased crime rate\ntrend during the subsequent years (1972-1977 in comparison to 1967-1972) in contrast to control\ncities matched for geographic region, population, college population, and crime rate.\nResearch Review on the Maharishi Effect\n\u2022 In 24 cities where 1% of the population had\nbegun the basic TM technique (practising TM singly in their own homes), as compared to 24\ncontrol cities, crime rate fell in the year after\nthe 1% threshold was reached. The trend to\nreduce crime continued for the next five years.\nThe study was statistically controlled for\npopulation density, median years education,\npercentage employed and other factors that\nusually affect crime. (Journal of Crime and\nJustice, 4, 25-45.)\n\u2022 A day-by-day study of a two-month T MSidhi assembly in Israel showed that, on days\nof high attendance, war deaths in neighbouring\nLebanon dropped by 76%. At the same time,\ncrime, traffic accidents and fires all declined in\nIsrael. Other possible causes (week-ends,\nholidays, weather, etc) were statistically\ncontrolled. (The Journal of Conflict\nResolution, 32, 776-812.)\n\u2022 Statistics provided by the Rand Corporation\nshowed that, during the three largest TM-Sidhi\nassemblies ever held (approaching or\nexceeding 7,000 participants, the square root of\n1% of the world's population), worldwide\nterrorism dropped by 72%. At the same time,\nall international conflict reduced by more than\n30%. (Presented to the American Political\nScience Association.)\n\u2022 A comprehensive Quality of Life index for\nthe U.S.( crime rate, hospital admissions rate,\nalcohol consumption rate, gross national\nproduct per capita, etc) declined steadily from\n1960 to 1981, with a total drop of 10%. After\nthe TM-Sidhi group in Fairfield, Iowa, reached\nthe square root of 1% of the U.S. population,\nthe Quality of Life index suddenly moved\nupwards, regaining the entire two-decades drop\nof 10% in just three years. (Social Science\nPerspectives Journal, 2(4), 127-146)\n\u2022 Since 1987, when approximately 100 people\nbegan practising the TM-Sidhi programme in aTM village near Merseyside, the crime rate for\nMerseyside fell by 60% when compared with\nthe rest of the country, taking it from having\nthe third highest crime rate in Britain to the\nlowest for a metropolitan area. (Presented to\nthe Annual Conference of the British\nPsychological Society on Criminal and Legal\nPsychology, 1-3, March 1993.)\n\n"
