The\ntight-rope exercise of \"stretch-the-mandate\"? The\ninstructions given at the Llandudno conference stated\nthat no platform was to be shared with racists or\nfascists and the same motion condemned the \"Get\nBritain Out\" Campaign because it contained racist and\nfascist elements. Yet when I spoke to Charles last\nMonday, he was calmly sure that he was within the\nparameters set out by the mandate. But even he admits\nthat he took his interpretation right up to the limit \u2014\nonly the Conference at Scarborough next November can\ndecide whether that limit was deliberately crossed or\nnot.\n*\nToday sees a new slant on an old idea to add a kind\nof novelty to the impact of serious student militancy.\nThe Overseas Students Committee have decided to\npicket the Imperial College Board of Governors meeting\nwhich is planned to start at around 10.30 am this\nmorning. A petition is being presented to the GB' s Chairman, Sir Henry Fisher, in protest at the recent\ngovernment announcements relating to self-supporting\nstudents fees increases.\nFELIX wishes the protest well and hopes to have a full report next week.\n*\nIncidentally, there is no truth whatsoever in the\nmalicious rumour that I got pissed with John Randall\nlast Monday on cans of Swan lager.

Nowhere is the text of the\nsubstantive motion mentioned,\nnor is any reference made to\nactual arguments used in proposing this motion. In summary, the motion noted\nthe increase in potential\nmarkets for British Industry,\nthe support from men and\ncountries of political learning\nfor our membership, the improved\nterms of membership and the\ngovernment take-over of British leyland. Amongst the arguments\npresented for the Pro-Market\ncase, it was suggested that\nBritain s sovereignty would be\nenhanced through being less\ndependant on the USA and also world peace would be strengthened by the presence of a powerful European Community.\nOn top of these, this country\nis in the grips of a financial\nCrisis and needs all the support\nit can get from our neighbours.\nThe motion concluded by condemning the reactionary\nactions of the NUS and instructing the Exec to make\ncertain information for the\nPro-Market cause available and\nto communicate to various\npress and politicians, our support for continued member*\nship of the European Economic Community.\nYours sincerely,\nTJ. D. Pye3 F ORLY\nLORNA THOMAS.\nHERE WE are again! It's the high-spot of the week, yes, you've\nguessed it, it's the IF Only column! Of course, I feel very honoured\nthat the august Editor of FELIX allows our humble weekly\nintrusions into their illustrious publication . So it hardly seems\nfair to launch into in desc rl mate criticism of IC as has unfortunately been the case in the\npast.( AIthough it would give\nme something MEATY to write\nabout).\nHowever I think it would be\nbetter to abandon all attempts\nat profundity and write something pleasantly mundane,\nwhich will conform to everyone's idea of the dumb\nsecretary, (and isn't it drummed\ninto our tiny thick heads from\nthe word go, that the secretary's duty is to butter up her boss?). Thats about 120 words and\nso another 1 5 0 should just\nabout do\nAnyway, while I'm here, I may as well introduce myself.;\nI am the Rag Rep,( no, I'm NOT responsible for the staff's clothes) and it's my job to beg,\nimplore etc\" etc to take part in\nRag Week. In other words, a case of a little gently persuasion.( NOBODY expects the\nSpanish Inqueistion). All this\nis no easy task. Of course, the pathetic,\nwell, lets be tactful, elite\nnumber of IF students who turn out for collecting is hardly\nsurprising considering that\nrough ly two-thirds of the college commutes from the far-flung\nrealms of Wimbledon, Ruislip etc etc. But what about the\nother third? You may well ask. Collecting goes on all through the autumn term and if\nyou could only manage one\nsingle Saturday out of the rest\nof your life, it helps. Also, coIl ec ting can be really hilarious, and you have the\nsatisfaction of doing something\nworthwhile and....Amen to all that!\nPS. Would all the budding\nj polit ian s at IC deign to step\ndown from their boring, extremist platforms and DO something constructive like\nthe rest of us peaceable\nmortals, who realise we can't change the world with our\nradical ideas?\nEDUCATIONAL REDEPLOYMENT THE EDUCATIONAL Re deployment Service was set up in1969 and is still the\nonly nationally operating unit\nwhich concerns itself solely with the problems faced by\nthose who are so often damn-ingly labelled \" dropouts.\" For the past two years it has received Government help in order to offer FREE aid to all those students discontinuing, for whatever reasons, from\ndegree, H ND etc courses. Information is available mainly\non employment, alternative\ncourses, careers and grants\nbut machinery is on hand to help with any careers problem\nno matter how obscure.\nThe ERS is not seeking to\nsupplant any of the welfare/\npersonal tutor/ etc facilities which exist at IC. But it does\npoint out that certain discontinuing students may feel\naggrieved towards the\ninstitution responsible for\nhaving failed him and might\ntherefore be unwilling to seek\nhelp there .Also, many students\nhave already left the campus\nbefore learning they are not\neligible to continue with their\ncourse while others are simply\nunaware of the facilities\navailable to them with their\nown college or university. For\nall such students, and many\nmore besides, the ERS is a valuable additional source of\ninformation/advice/help.\nSo if you know of anyone\nwho is considering \"dropping-out,\" get him or her to contact\nthe ERS at 20, Gower Street,\nLondon WC1E6DP\n(01-637 0450).\nTHETA SHIRTS\nFor Ladies arid\nGentlemen of Res.

    "content": "7\nREVIEWS\nCONCERT Stephen Thompson\nIC Choir: 'Jephtha' by G.F. Handel;\nand 'Missa Brevis in A' by J.S. Bach.\nWRITTEN IN 1752, ten years after\nMessiah, Handel's Jephtha is one of his lesser known oratorios; however it\ncontains all the usual Handelian brilliance\nand PC Choir and their re gua lr conductor,\nEric Brown, are to be congratulated on\nthe performance they gave us last Friday\nevening in Holy Trinity Church. They\nwere ably supported by an orchestra\nwhich deserves its adjective \" special\". Particularly noteworthy was the brilliant\ntrumpet work, of which Handel is so much,\nthe master. Among the soloists Richard\nGandy and John Williams stood out; the\nformer for his beautifully controlled runs\nand the latter for his clear countertenor\nvoice. The choruses were sung with the\nenthusiasm which we have come to expect\nfrom the choir. One minor grumble was that the audience was not provided with\nlibretti, making the following of the work\nso much more difficult.\nThe concert opened with the Mlssa\nBrevis in A of J.S. Bach. Unfortunately\nthe acoustics of the church did not\nstand up to the precision of Bach' s choral writing and the effectiveness of the work\nwas spoiled. The Bach Mass also served\nto lengthen the concert to almost three\nhours, despite extensive cuts in the\nHandel, and the enjoyment, towards the\nend, was marred by people leaving early.\nLr Id\nTrevor Phillips\nBOOKS C.R. Hensman: Rich Against Poor\n(Penguin).\nTHE RICH and poor in question here\nare countries as opposed to people, and\nthe book attempts to analyse the theory\nand practice of state aid to underdeveloped\ncountries. It also puts into perspective\nthe actual economic status of some of the\nnon-major countries; it comes as something\nof a shock to learn that General Motors\nhas a greater gross national product than\nmany 'advanced' countries, including\nSwitzerland, and most of the larger\nAmerican corporations completely overshadow the underdeveloped nations. Until recently the majority of people\nhad seen America as a great, unselfish\nbenefactor pouring huge sums of money\ninto helping its poorer dependents strive\ntowards their own economic stability. Attitudes have changed somewhat (partly\ndue to Watergate) and In fact it emerges\nthat, surprise surprise, Uncle Sam does\nnot always deliver the goods as ethically as we might hope. Although the book is\nprimarily concerned with destroying the\nmyths of government aid it also presents\narguments as to how some of the problems\ncan, in theory at least, be rectified. The\nroots of the problems, however, lie in the\nminds of those politicians who persist in\nbelieving that the control of natural\nresources grants them the powers to toy\nwith the lives of ordinary people.\nSigmund Freud: The Psychopathology\nof Everyday Life (Penguin).\nPSYCHOLOGY IS perhaps the science which more than any other appeals to the\naverage layman, the educated and\nIAM writing my first reactions to the\ngrants announcement made on Tuesday.\nIt underlines the cynicism and unfairness\nwith which Reg Prentice has ruled the\nDES over the past fourteen months. True,\nstudents at IC have received an increase\nof 21.8% on last year's award does not\neven make up for the Inflation during '74-'75, much less provide for the increased\ncost of lodging and refectory mea Is a Iready\nin the pipeline. True, the married women's grant has been abolished \u2014 but the\nspouses' contribution remains. The fact\nthat the base level of the parental mean\ntest has risen from \u00a31600 to \u00a32200 does\nnot mean that fewer people pay; it means\nthat larger chunks of parents' incomes\nwhich will have risen by about the same\namount actually go into the parental\ncontribution. This in turn means that\nstudents who-;have trouble getting their\nparents to pay the contribution will face\neven greater problems.\nAnd nothing has been done about\ndiscretionary awards \u2014 the biggest\nscandal of all. This is a \"now-you-see-it-now-you-don't\" award. It may seem an unnecessarily harsh attack upon Mr Prentice since at first sight the announcement appears\nto be attractive. If this were October\n1974, it would be; but anyone who sits and considers what the pace of inflation\nand the cost of accommodation and food\nwill be in October will begin to wonder\nhow he or she will manage.\nI consider it a cynical award because\nnothing has been done for the worst-off\nstudents of all: the students on disc re tio nary awards. Instead, Prentice, the\nself-proclaimed \"militant moderate\" has\nhimself demonstrated the effectiveness\nof the rent strikes and occupations\nmounted by the \" big battalions\" in the\nuniversities and poly s. This, by the way,\nanswers the critics of that militancy, who\nsaid that these tactics gain nothing for\nstudents. The DES has followed the\ngeneral policy over the cuts which I delineated In a Precipice some months\nago. That is to make them fall hardest on\nthose least able to afford it, and those\nleast able to defend themselves \u2014\ndiscretionary award students, adult\neducation, overseas students etc. It is, of course, why university teachers have\nhad little luck so far; they have disclaimed mi lit an cy. The tragedy is that no-one wants\ndisruption,except people who believe that\na student occupation will spark off the\nrevolution. But the fake moderates like\nPrentice are driving the real moderates\nwho simply want a fair deal for the\neducation service, to real militancy. Let us hope that the interests of the education\nservice prevail before it is irreparably\ndamaged.\nI consider it a cynical award because nothing has been done for\nthe worst-off students of all: the students on discretionary awards.\ninquisitive 'man in the street'; probably\nbecause it helps him to understand the\nway in which he and his fellow members\nof society react in various situations. It\nalso has the added advantage that,\nalthough it is now highly developed, it\ndoes not require any particular prior\nknowledge to understand many of its most interesting assertions. Hand-in-hand with psychology is the\nname of Sigmund Freud, and as well as contributing invaluable theories he was also concerned with making his subject\nmore accessible to the general public.\nTo this end he wrote this book in 1901;\nin it he proffers explanations to such\ncommonplace occurrences as slips of the\ntongue and the forgetting of peoples\nname s.He makes much use of actual\nexamples to support his theories, and\nthe book makes for fascinating reading;\nit will quite probably whet your appetite\nfor further insight into this vast, ever-growing subject.\nMike Petty\nNorman Hunter: Professor Branestawm\nUp the Pole (Penguin).\nIN THIS latest series of adventures\nwe find our hero grappling with an increasingly unlikely series of situations\nas a result of his incessant, perhaps\nsome would say obsessive, flair for\ninventing the most bizarre and preposterous gadgetry. This time Professor\nBranestawm attempts to startle the world\nwith machines for producing cakes, painting flagpoles, making pictures and\nprinting money. (The only time a vestige\nof common sense seems to enter his head).\nHe even tries his hand at railway\nbuilding \u2014 no need to worry Eric, it\ndidn't work!\nThe stories are very much the same \u2014\nProf, gets an inspiration and invents a gadget which subsequently goes crazy. Just as the inventions are getting\ncompletely out of hand, Colonel Dedshott\nand his Catapult Cavaliers always arrive\nto take charge and sort out the pandemonium - is there a moral here?\nThis book is for Branestawn addicts\nonly.\nRECORDS^^^^^^^^^^*^^> Ian Morse\nScaffold: Sold Out (Warner Bros)\nSCAFFOLD \u2014 a structure supporting\nsome weight or even another structure.\nWell, in this case, I think not. The band meander limply through mostly\ntraditional songs, barely supported by\nsession musicians and members of\nGrimmes, a group our three heroes seem\nto have a partial interest in. Renditions of\nLiverpool Lou, Lord of the Dance and\nLeaving of Liverpool are offered for the\nlisteners palate, even Hokey Cokey is\ngiven the once-over in true party style. Coupled with these, are a few not so amusing songs by Messers McGough &\nMc Gear. Overall the effect is somewhat like\nblind men wading through a torrent of turd .\nYes, the more I listen to this album the\nmore I am reminded of another term\nassociated with the word ' scaffold' \u2014\ncapital punishment. Lets hope as far as Scaffold is concerned, this album is just\na tempor y stage, (ged d it?). ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, SO THIS\nPARTICULAR SPACE IS\nSEMI-MEANINGLESS, OK?\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX THE COMMON EEC or\nBUSTLITERALLY I OR Bill Gerrard\nWHEN CONSIDERING a change in law, one must always beware of \"the grass is\ngreener on the other side of the hill \"syndrome. Certainly the EEC has many faults, but\nthe anti-market e ers have consistently shown themselves to be suffering from this\nsyndrome by their inability to outline a vigorous and plausible alternative.\nIf you believe that Frogs, Dogos, Krauts and Wops will be the destruction of this\ncountry, and that the solution to Britain' s problems is to send home all wo gs etc, I fear\nthat there is very little I could do to convince you otherwise, except to suggest a psychiatrist who is an expert on xenophobia. Henceforth, I will ignore the illogical ranting s of the extreme right and will only swot at their sort of arguments when they\nraise their ugly heads in (national) socialist ideas. In looking at the arguments of the Left, one finds it difficult to see a general theme\nto their arguments. Overall, it would appear that their reasons for wanting to leave\nEurope are that Europe is only worth joining when it has become a socialist institution\nof Utopian proportions, and yet, the socialists are rapidly becoming the largest single\nparty in Europe. Since no-one has Issued an organised\nalternative to the EEC I can only work on\nthe assumption that if we left we would\ngo it alone or rejoin (if possible) what is\nleft of EFTA. Our biggest problem would\nbe forming regular trade connections\u2014 who\nwould trust us in the long term after\nditching three sets of trading partners in\nless than a decade (Commonwealth, EFTA\nand EEC)? A country like Britain, whose\ntrade is based upon importing raw\nmaterials and exporting finished materials\nneeds a guaranteed market. Our only large\nnatural resource (North sea oil) is largely\nmortgaged, large sections of our industry\nrun inefficiently, and our coffers are\nalmost empty. If we left the EEC without\na viable alternative we will be bankrupted,\nand the political extremism (as seen in\nNorway) will be explosive here.\nLet us consider the main arguments\nstaying in the EEC:1. \"That it is a capitalist plot aimed in\nparticular at supporting the super-companies.\" The giant firms of Europe,\nmany of them British-based managed to\ngrow to their proportions before the EEC was formed. I wil I agree there are possible\nIN REPLY Mr Phillips' article only confirms what\nI have said above: there is no workable\nalternative to the EEC.. His article seems\nto suggest that we should leave the EEC and announce to the world, \"We are no\nlonger capitalists, so please be kind and\ntrade with us at nice prices!\" No system( unless self-sufficient, which we are not)\nof whatever political persuasion, can progress unless it is prepared to trade\ncom pet iv ely \u2014 an idea which Mr Phillips automatically confuses into exploitation.\nTo suggest that the Third World has not yet learnt how to remove oppressive\ncapitalist corporations, and organise\nitself into trading groups similar ir it nature to the EEC, belies the achi ev ment s of the Arab oil states, and much of Africa and Asia. The nature of government of the EEC does not meet with his approval, but does\nit seem so much worse than any other\ncountry's system? We can rely on people\nlike Mr Phillips to petition successfully the huge European socialist and communist\nparties to prevent the possible dangers\nhe for sees./ believe his article only reinforces\nthe need to say YES to Europe!\ndangers if controls are not introduced, but\nthese controls are best fixed internationally\nso that a giant company cannot intimidate\nsmall countries simply because of its economic power. A positive advantage of\nthe EEC is its potential ability to place\ncontrols on business concerns.\n2. \"That we will lose our ability to\ngovern ourselves.\" The argument here\nrevolves round the word \" we\". If \" we\" means the typical British( dare I say it?)\nworker, then we have never had much say in how our country is run. In the European\nParliament, unlike Westminster, virtually\nevery major political party has represent-at ives. The selection procedure for\nrepresentatives is probably more democratic than the British system which left the Liberal party with a handful of\nseats in return for a fifth of the votes\ncast. Westminster is only up the road\nfrom us, and yet for all the good that\ndoes us it might as well be in Brussels. I believe this argument can therefore only\nbe accepted by anarchists who don't want\nany government or by those who have\nselfish nation list interests at stake.\n3. \"That being in the EEC strengthens\nNATO and encourages a further military\nbuild-up\". Just because we are in the\nEEC does not mean we have to belong to\nNATO \u2014 eg France is not in NATO. While we have \" friendly\" nations e.g. Russia visiting neighboring friendly nations like\nHungary and Czech os lava kia, perhaps a military force, however unpleasant the\nidea, is essential.4. \"That the EEC will reinforce neo-colonial conditions in the Third-World\ncountries.\" You can bet it has joined in\na group of like-minded nations e.g. Warsaw Pact, OPEC( Arab oil states),\nCentral African group,etc. Ido not accept\nthe principle that because our forefathers\nexploited a certain country that we should\nnow let it knock the stuffing out of us.I believe it is patronising to suggest that\nthe Third World countries cannot now in\nthe main look after their own interests.\n5. \"Prices are higher in the EEC.\" /Vof\ntrue! \" Which\"( May '75) editorial points\nout that prices would have been at least\nas high outside the EEC. A Ithough the referendum is a ludicrous\nidea, it is important to vote because of\nthe immense impact the result will have\non our method of government (especially\na \"no\" vote).I hope having outlined some\nof the contentious areas, you will be able\nto vote \"yes\" to Europe with confidence.\nr Out side the EEC Britain would be bankrupt\"\n\n"

The increases have taken\neffect immediately.\nGRANTS ANNOUNCEMENT:\nCHICKENFEED!\nAS ONE might have expected, the grant increases announced by Mr Prentice on Tuesday\nfall short of the 40% called by the NUS. The increase of 22% does however raise the\nLondon grant from \u00a3 6 6 5 to \u00a3 8 1 0 . Married women students will now be treated the same as\nmarried male students, and the starting point on the salary scale for parental contributions\nhas been raised.\nCLARKE CAUSES FUR ORE CHARLES CLARKE; the NUS of a political storm.\nThe row has erupted because\nMr Clarke appeared at a press\nconference on the invitation of\nthe Get Britain Out Campaign\nCommittee a week yesterday.\nThis action was taken despite\nthe fact that Mr Clarke was under a mandate from the\nLlandudno Conference which strongly d is a proves of members\nof the NUS executive appearing\non shared platforms of this\nkind. The Llandudno conference\nhad noted \"The umbrella\nnature of the national Get Britain Out CampaignCommittee\nand the presence of Powellites\nand other racialist s on that\nCommittee\" and as a result\ninstructed the NUS executive\nto \"appear under no circumstances on platforms with\npresident-elect, is at the centre\nracists and fascists\" .\nIt would seem therefore that\nMr Clarke' s appearance on the\ninvitation of the Committee is in violation of this instruction. Mr Clarke contends this and told our reporter that the\nparticular people with whom he\nshared the platform were not putting forward ideas that\nconflicted with the attitude of\nthe NUS on campaigning\nprocedures with regards to the\nEEC debate.\nHowever, there are certain\ngroups within the student\nmovement who disagree strongly\nwith Mr Clarke' s action. He will probably face harsh\ncriticisms and possible censure\nat the next NUS conference in Scarborough next November.\nThe 22% increase follows\na25% increase last year.\nDuring the past year the rate\nof inflation has increased, as have the levels of other wage\nsettlements.\nNUS has described the\nincrease (which the DES claims to be based on the\nannual rate of inflation) as disappointing though it\nwelcomed the decision to end\ndiscrimination ;i'ga in st married\nwomen. John Randall, the\ncurrent NUS president, has\ncalled for a rent freeze to\nprotect student li v ing standards, as the whole of the increase\nwould be swallowed up in the\nincrease cost of books,\nclothing, transport and other\nessentials. Several Vice Chancellors are reported to fear further\nstudent militancy as the\nGovernment has failed to give\nlarge enough grants to meet\nincreased costs of university\nand college halls and lodgings.\nRent strikes are indeed in progress at severa1 universities .\nActual figures for the new\ngrants are as follows with the\ncurrent grants in brackets:\nLondon grant: \u00a3810 (\u00a3665), an increase of 22%; elsewhere:\n\u00a3740 (\u00a3605), an increase of\n22%; students living at home:\n\u00a3570 (\u00a3475), an increase of\n2 0 % .\nParental contributions now\nstart at a residual income of\n\u00a32,200 (\u00a31,600).\nWhilst Mr Prentice has failed to make all non-degree\ncourses subject to mandatory\nawards (he claims this would\ncost \u00a3200m.), he has abolished\nthe discretionary Awards (in\nfavour of mandatory awards)\nfor initial teacher training,\nH ND and D HE courses. Women students will now\nbe able to claim dependants\nallowances for husbands and\nchildren but there is still no\nchange in the unpopular\npractice of assessing a spouse's contribution.\nWarwick Rent Strike Strengthens\nThe Warwick University Student Union's fight against its University administration has finally collapsed after three terms\nof bitter struggle. The end, heralded by a high-court injunction\ngiving the Warwick University administration the right to reoccupy\nthe telephone exchange and the Senate Building came when 500 -750 policemen (including 3 0\npolicewomen) arrived on Thur s day of last week to evict the\noccupying students.\nThe trouble began in the\nSpring term when 800 of the\n2,700 students on campus\nwent on rent strike in protest\nagainst higher rents. Threats\nby the University to render the\nstrikers in eligible for examinations aroused anger and resulted in a Union meeting\nvoting to occupy the Senate\nbuilding. Building. The attempts of the\nAcademic Registrar to pressure\nstudents into submission by saying that the examinations\ncould not proceed as planned\nfurther aggravated the situation Obtaining of a High Court\npossession order by the\nUniversity and of its serving\nto the students added yet more fuel to the fire. A picket\nwas mounted on the Senate\nBuilding by some students and\nothers occupied the nearby\nUniversity Arts Centre.

While the picket\nhas been withdrawn and the\nArts Centre is no longer being\noccupied. This decision came\nafter the Senate meeting.\nThere is to be a day of\naction on the educational cuts\non June 4th and, on the campus.\nThe Students Union is also to\ninvestigate the University' s finance and will base their\ncampaign for 1975/6 on the\noutcome of this investigation.

A. Gerrard (ICU Hon.Sec.) GDD\nJackson (SCC Chairman) and MJL Williams\n(Editor of FELIX). The Hon Sec , DP and President\npresented their annual reports to the meeting\nwhich were accepted .\nNigel Foster\nI HAVE BEEN writing this column for two years now and regular readers wi II recall\nthat throughout the past season I have stated my belief that this is the finest IC team\never to have passed through these hallowed cloisters . because I felt that such an array of talent might never again be gathered here I had prayed that this side would\nleave a legacy that future sides could only aspire to. This I believe we have done and\nI record it now.\nOur season traditionally comprises o three major tasks: the London Championships,\nthe South and Eastern Universities League, and the South and Eastern Universities Championships .Weset ourselves the target of winning all three. The first hurdle of the\nLondon Championships we had not cleared since 1933 . This year IC won by a mile with\nour first team coming home 27 shots clear of our second team and the rest nowhere .\nThe final two hurdles were to be\ndecided on Monday May 5th and it was a poignant day for us all. The S and E Championships were over 3 6 holes, a championship that prior to last year's victory we had never done remotely well in. As defend ing champions and favourites\nwe felt confident. Alas, at the end of the\nday we found to our dismay that we had\nlost by 1 shot to Southampton who had\ntaken 485 shots to our 4 8 6 . The fact that\nNigel Foster had won the net t prize with\nround of 7 5 and 7 6 and that Ed Clutton\nhad again taken a gross prize did little\nto dampen the sorrow felt by all at seeing\nour dreams dashed after being so close to\nvictory.\nThe league we felt we had comfortably\nwon as we had played all of our matches\nwith only one defeat. To our surprise\nSussex and Southampton claimed a right\nto a share as although they had less\npoints than us they could mathematically\nhave just caught us had they played all of their matches. As President of South\nand Eastern Universities it was my task\nto adjudicate in this matter. It Would have\nbeen easy for me to declare us winners\nparticularly as we had smashed Sussex\n5-1 when the two sides had met. However,\nto give no side any 'hard luck' story and\nto avoid a tie I decided to hold a nine\nhole putting competition between representatives from each side to decide the\nissue. The choosing of the IC representative did not look easy with\nso many gifted putters in the room. However, once the committee's eyes had\nfallen on our bearded Portuguese International John Mendonca, the choice was not in doubt . He was sitting in the corner,\nagin and tonic in each hand, recalling how he had holed from a bunker to beat\nthe French National Champion in front of\nboth TV cameras and a huge-crowd (his\nlistener, Ed Clutton, was fast asleep!). Handing his putter to him with the\nwords \" Go get the league or buy us all\ndinner\" we pushed him onto the putting\ngreen. There, with the sort of confidence\nthat only G in and Tonic drinkers can muster, he ambled round nine holes to\nwin by one shot in level par. The result\ncan never convey the trauma he caused\nhis supporting onlookers at the third.\nThere he held a one shot lead which he\nlost by playing an 'air-shot' at a half\ninch putt. This left poor Mike Strickland\nparalysed for breath. Luckily Chris Cobble dick was on hand to poke a putter\nbetween Mike's legs or he would never\nhave seen the giant putt John knocked in\na few holes later to take the winning lead. Thus in the major three IC tournaments\nwe won two and lost one by a hair's breadth. In summing up the season it is difficult not to mention the London\nUniversity results since this team was almost entirely made up of IC players. The Oxford v. Cambridge Varsity match\nwas an amusing event for us to read\nabout as we had already defeated both\nsides in question prior to their meeting.\n(Indeed Sunningdale Golf Club has now\ncancelled its traditional matches against\nthese sides and replaced them with a fixture against us.). On other fronts IC\nplayers are entering many individual\nevents and Ed Clutton managed to win a major tournament in Wales a few weeks\nago. As for the future IC will be touring\nNorth in the summer and has entered a side for the British Universities Champions hips, not a traditional fixture as normally\nour chances of victory would be remote,\nbut this year who knows? (leVu s know\nwhat happens\u2014Ed.).\nFinally I end by rendering my thanks\nto this year's outgoing committee of Huw\nRosser (Capt.), Bob Allan( V Capt.), Bill Calberwood ( Sec), and Mike Marx (Treas.)\nfor the work they have put in this year.\nParticularly worthy of mention is Bill CarJerwood who has worked with machine-like dedication to see that the season has\nbeen run smoothly (and it has!). Next\nyear with Bob Allan as Captain and John\nMendonca as Vice Captain forming the\ncommittee backbone, we can look forward\nto another fine IC season and with Ed Clutton as London University Secretary\nwe are assured of seeing hat ful s of caps\ncoming the Queen's Tower way .\nANNUAL REVIEWS\nAnnual reviews of Clubs\nand societies (especially\nsports clubs) are invited\nfor publication in FELIX. Copy should be submitted to the FELIX Office\nas soon as possible and the\nlength of the articles should\nbe limited to 500 words.\n\n"
