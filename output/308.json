A very militant Conference\ntook a clear line on the\nissue of Northern Ireland\n\u2014asking for the end of in-tern ment, the withdrawal\nof British Troops, a United\nIreland and the support of\nall groups defending the\nminority community in the\nNorth, including both the\nregular and provisional\nwings of the IRA. However\nit was clearly stated that\ndifficulties of an immediate\nUnited Ireland solution lay\nnot least in the Irish republic itself, still bedevilled\nby legacies of a social,\neconomic and religious\nnature.\nA strong, unrepresentative, lefty policy on an\nissue we shouldn't be discussing many might say. I hope the many saw the\nplight of Derry that Sunday. No concern of ours?\nInternment? British troops?\nOn Autonomy a mammoth\ndebate left a still far from\ndistinct approach. Negotiations were still rejected. A broadening of the campaign to link it with such\nproblems as James, Rothschild, etc., was accepted.\nA March Day of Action\nwas called for. Perhaps the\nbiggest change was the rejection of public account-ability, a decision that split\nConference. My personal\nview was an unsatisfied\none at the outcome of that\ndebate. However Birmingham Conference will be\ncoming up soon and ICU\nwill have to resolve these\nissues internally if its voice\nis to be clearly heard\nthen.\nIt is hoped that copies\nof the completed motions\nwill be available from the\nIC Union Office when this\nFelix is published, or in\nthe near future.\nInternational Everest Expedition Many will have seen the\ntelevised film of this expedition that was built up as\nan example of international co-operation and finished in an example of\ninternational chaos. One\nman killed, half the party\nwalked off moaning about\nthe Anglo-Saxons' mono-poly, and the final ascent\nstalled by bad weather and\npoor logistics. Was this\nfinal outcome the result of\nnational disharmony, the\nfilthy weather, or just too\nmany great climbers wanting their piece of the cake?\nThe televised film did its\nbest to expose all, but all\nthat was exposed was the\nlife at base camps. To find\nout the true story, or at\nleast a version of it, the\nExploration Society have\ninvited Don Whillans, who\nwith Dougal Haston spent\ntwo gruelling weeks on the\nface while the bickering\nwas going on in base\ncamp, to give an illustrated lecture on his experiences on this expedition.\nThis will be on Tuesday,\n29th February at 8.00 p.m. in the Great Hall. Tickets\nare obtainable in advance\nby sending a cheque payable to the Exploration\nBoard for 30p per person\nto the Exploration Society,\nvia Pam in the Receptionist's Office.\nLLOYD TUNBRIDGE.\nHOT DOGS\nAre your meals lacking\ninterest?, are you fed up\nwith cockroach and chips\nat Mooney? Do you long\nfor a change of diet?\nDream no more! For two\nwhole weeks IC will be\ntempted to sample the gastronomical delicacies of\nMethsoc Hotdogs.\nThese tasty snacks will\nbe available at every major\nfunction during rag fort-night, and during the space\nof 14 days we hope to satisfy hungry IC students\nwith 2,500 hot dogs. Methsoc (or Imperial College\nMethodist Society to give\nits full title) has continued\nthis fine olde English tradition since time immemorial, and even as far back\nas 1964 !\nThe Landsnapper Sneeze\nLETTER TO\nTHE EDITOR\nDear Sir,\nMay I beg space to raise\nthe airing of Refectory\ncomplaints.\nIn all refectories points\narise which merit com-plaint. However, all too\noften customers are reluctant to air them publicly\n(for fear that nothing will\nbe done?), and the complaint is not corrected.\nThe Complaints subCommittee hopes to start\nan effective system by\nwhich complaints will be\nput right quickly, but its\nefficiency depends upon\nthe active support of all\nRefectory users.\nNotices will soon be put\nup in each refectory explaining what should be\ndone, but I feel that an explanation here could be\nhelpful.\nWe divide complaints\ninto two classes:\u2014\n1. Direct complaints\n(particular meals, dirty\ncutlery, etc.): complain to\nthe counter staff, if they\nare unhelpful ask for the\nChef or the Supervisor.\nEnter the complaint in the\nComplaints Book, even if it\nwas rectified, stating what\naction (if any) was taken.\n2. General complaints\nand suggestions: enter\nthese in the Complaints\nBook.\nComplaints Books are\nbeing issued to all pay\ndesks with instructions\nthat they are to be available on demand. If your\ndemand is refused, see the\nSupervisor or the Complaints Officer. These are:\nUnion Building: Steve\nCann: Beit 32.\nCollege Block: Mike\nBaum: Beit 30.\nSouthside: Duncan\nLocke: E.E. P.G. Emerging complaint patterns can then be seen\nquickly and corrective action taken.\nGood points are equally\nimportant, if you notice\nany that should be adopted in other refectories, be\nas quick to tell us as you\nare to complain. It could\nall help to improve the service given.\nFinally, No Smoking notices will soon be put up,\nGisbert & Treasy Kapp\nTravelling Scholarships\nA bequest has been\nmade to the National\nUnion of Students to allow\nfor the award of three\nscholarships of not less\nthan \u00a350 for the purposes\nof travel during the long\nvacation. Such travel\nshould be devoted in part\nto projects connected with\nthe applicant's field of\nstudy, and those receiving\ngrants will be expected to\nwrite brief reports on their\nproject which may, if suit-able, be published by\nNUS in relevant journals.\nObvious examples of suitable projects are visits to\nfactories, research centres\nor university departments,\ndevoted to an applicant's field of study. It is not intended that the travel\nas will price lists before\nthe counter service and at\neach pay desk.\nYours faithfully,\nFRANK POTTER,\nChairman, Refectory\nComplaints Sub-Committee.\nshould be purely for a study purpose of this type\nand the short type of project indicated may well be\ncarried out over a few\ndays, during a longer holi-day.\nThe award is open to\nboth undergraduate and\npostgraduate students, but\nother things being equal,\npreference will be given to\nstudents in some branch of\nEngineering with particular reference to Electrical\nand Electro-Chemical Engineering.\nCandidates must have\nbeen a member of the university for two or more\nyears and must be nominated for the scholarships\nby the representative student bodies of the University Unions or Junior Common Rooms who should\nsubmit the names of the\nnominated candidates to:\nEducation and Welfare\nDepartment,\nNational Union of\nStudents,\n3 Endsleigh Street,\nLondon, WC1 ODU.\n\n"

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX Thursday, 10th February, 1972\nREVIEWS Is there a need for film\ncensorship? This point has\nbeen debated throughout\nthe seventy year history of\nthe cinema. The discussion has again reached a fever pitch over the subject of ultra-violence particularly in films such as\n\"The Clockwork Orange\"\nand \"Straw Dogs\". Unfortunately, due to the excesses of the advertising\nindustry I have failed to\nsee \"The Clockwork\nOrange\" and have seen\nSam Peckinpah's \"Straw\nDogs\". Sam Peckinpah has\nspent the 1960's making\nWesterns culminating in\nhis 'meditation on viol-en ce', \"The Wild Bunch\";\nperhaps one of the first\nultra-violent films, yet \"The\nWild Bunch\" did not produce as much condemnation as \"Straw Dogs\", perhaps because of the less\nsexual context of the violence in \"The Wild\nBunch\" than in \"Straw\nDogs\": this is just one of\nthe obstacles that the\ncinema must cross in the\nprocess of growing up.\nThe film stars Dustin Hoffman as the inoffensive\nmathematician on a year's sabbatical to write a book\non Cosmology, who comes\nto Cornwall for the peace.\nSusan George plays\nAmy, his wife, whom he\nhas to neglect while he is\nwriting his book.\nThe film concerns his\nregaining her love, but\nonly after killing seven\n\"The Decameron\"\nFilms\nmen. The violence in the\nfilm is very horrific and\ntreated with all the 'lyrical'\ntechniques used in \"The\nWild Bunch\". Yet the\nstory-line and character is at ions are too unreal to\nsupport such realism.\nDustin Hoffman repeats\nhis role in \"The Graduate\"\nand Susan George as the\nsensual, neglected wife in\na role that has been done\nbetter in other films.\nThe story is set in and\naround an isolated village\nand unfortunately Sam\nPeckinpah has made the\nvillagers into the archetypal villagers as portrayed\nin dozens of films of similar type: there is a village\nidiot, the sensible but\nthick-skulled local squire,\na stupid parson and the\nquota of local farm boys\nwith more muscle than\nbrain.\nSam Peckinpah has fallen into the trap of being\nthe American Director in\nEngland. The 'handy' arrival of a thick fog was in\nthe best tradition of British\nthrillers of the 1930's and\n40's. For a director of\nSam Peckinpah's calibre\nthis film was a very great\ndisappointment: his previous film \"Monte Walsh\"\nwas a very good film a step\nback for Peckinpah from\n\"The Wild Bunch\" and,\nhopefully, his next film will\nbe another Western of the\nstandard of \"Monte\nWalsh\".\nI don't know how many\npeople were, like me,\nbored when Filmsoc\nshowed Pasolini's \"Theor-em\" last term, but when I received a ticket to see\nPasolini's latest film \" The Decameron\" I was expecting yet another boring\nevening, but I received a very pleasant surprise.\n\"The Decameron\" is\nbased on Boccaccio's tales of the 14th century;\nand in Pasolini's film the\nbawdiness and humour\ncomes over very well and\nPasolini has injected a great deal of unity into the\nessentially short story\nframework mainly by extending two stories\nthroughout the film. Most\nof the cast are people from\nNaples, yet they don't seem to be amateurs;\nPasolini appears as the\npainter Giotto; and overall\nPasolini has produced a good visual impression of\nthe people in the Decameron.\nThe state of marriage is Rupert Street.

Yawn.\nDiscs\nJEFF BECK GROUP; \"ROUGH AND\nREADY\" (Epic)\nAs I compose this review, listening to this\nrecord, you have no idea of the temptation that\nsurrounds me. Records by Yes, Frank Zappa, Pink\nFloyd and Soft Machine that I would dearly love\nto play instead of \"Rough and Ready\" by the Jeff\nBeck Group. But listen to it I must and the fact\nemerges that this is a very ordinary album.\nWhen Jeff Beck first came to prominence it was\nwith the sadly under-rated Yardbirds, who also\n\"discovered\" Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page. The\nYardbirds \"Shapes of Things\" is one of my favourite singles of all time and on that song in particular\nJeff Beck's work was way ahead of its time. The\ntwo albums by the Jeff Beck group (featuring Rod\nStewart on vocals!) were way ahead too. Beck was\none of the pioneers of the wah-wah pedal in those\ndays, while now that pedal is just another boring\ngimmick. Then he disappeared for two years or\nmore and in the meantime lots of groups like the\nYardbirds or the Jeff Beck Group have sprung up,\nand guitarists copying his style from those far-off\ndays \u2014 for example Ritchie Blackmore of Deep\nPurple \u2014 are regarded as the innovators.\nAfter his exile, partly self-imposed and partly due\nto a car crash Beck is back with a group consisting of himself, Bob Tench on vocals, Cozy Powell\n(Beck's double?) on drums, Max Middleton on\npiano and Clive Chaman on bass. It would, I feel,\nbe reasonable to expect something different \u2014\nperhaps a progression from \"Beck-Ola\"? But no,\nthis is just another rock album with various exchanges between guitar, piano and vocals which\nsay very little. In fact the vocals, apart from being\nmonotonous, make almost every track sound like\na Tamla-Motown \"heavy attempt\". \"Got the Feeling\" has some unsubtle wah-wah which was\noriginal in 1966 but still sounds as though Beck's just discovered it, and the other songs chug along\nwithout sounding much different from hundreds of\nother bands that don't have the ready-made following that this band will have. Actually, \"Raynes\nPark Blues\", the only song that doesn't have that\nchoppy pseudo-soul sound is O.K. An instrumental\nwith tasteful guitar and piano which really seems\nto go somewhere. But is eight minutes of good\nmusic enough to justify an album?\nIf this album had come out in 1968 or 69 it might\nhave sounded better, coming before the wave of\nheavy groups. As it is, Jeff Beck has missed the\nboat. Now forward to some music for the Seventies.\nThe Byrds; \"Farther Along\" (CBS)\nBack to the roots and good good old rock 'n roll with this strange album from The Byrds.\nThere is deep social comment, a couple of\nknees lapp in' foot-t appin' Square-Dance numbers\nwith a tasty banjo lead, and \" So Fine\" a take-off\n(I hope) of Frank Zappa's greasy bebop love\nsongs.\nIt's a treat for \"Byrdmaniax\" and it will sell well\nand give a lot of people a lot of pleasure which is\nwhat pop music is all about.\nGodspell Mk II\n\n"

Nevertheless, there are only ten alas all-too-infrequent issues a year, and most readers will want\nto read something else during the year. Your choice is\nbetween books and magazines. There are already too\nmany book reviewers in this world, and you do not need\none here. I'm going to look solely at magazines, which,\nregrettably, are going through a thin time. They cost too\nmuch to produce, and there are too many of them\u2014\nwhich means that hardly any of them make any money.\nMost of the few I look at this week are exceptions to\nthis rule. They are intended solely as a general selection to whet your appetite (or otherwise) for the rest\nof the series.\nMagazines have always held great fascination for\nme, ever since I first opened one at the tender age of\nabout three or four. I think it was a copy of 'Jack and\nJill', bought for me by one of my sisters, who took great\ndelight in those days in giggling (as girls in their early\nMcLOOGE SPOUTS\nPRESIDENTS PIECE\nThe now immortal Consultative Document has sown\nmany seeds, from those of a tidal wave of student activity to those of impassioned NUS Conference debates\nand more. It has caused Unions to stand back and examine the role they are fighting for and the organization\nthey are fighting with. It is these seeds that shaved up\nthe first saplings last Monday, 31st January, when, at a time that the Union is committed to fighting and exposing the Consultative Document and now the James\n(Teacher Education) and Rothschild (Postgraduate\nEducation) reports, to pressing for an increase of \u00a33\nin the Union Fee from \u00a37, he holding a referendum on\nespecially the role of the Constituent College Unions\nand I. C.W. A., to formulating a new Union Discipline\nprocedure, two papers were presented\u2014one presenting a new concept of the role of the Union, are presenting a new concept of the organization of the Union.\nEnough to completely destroy the bureaucratic bung-ling s of Council one would think. But no; perhaps the\nmost concentrated and illuminating of all Council discussions took place and though the end result was predictable (you've guessed\u2014a Union Structure Working\nParty), the ideas that have been broached are ones\nthat are unlikely to be dismissed lightly and ones that\nwill need the support, in terms of discussion at attendance at UGM's to decide on ensuing constitutional\nchanges, of all members of the Union.\nThese ideas included:\u2014\n\u2014The creation of a post-graduate affairs officer, to\nspark and fight for more P.G. involvement and aid within ICU.\nThe creation of a weekly Union new sheet. \u2014The creation of a weekly Felix on a'24 Hour' production basis, even a sabbatical Editor and an USK\nNewsheet.\n\u2014 A new attack by the Union to enjoy and effect the\nbalance of power within the College through more effective departmental representation.\n\u2014 A new co-ordination of all Union publications media\n\u2014less erratic bump h, more co-ordination (expansion of\nSTOIC into a true ICUTV was also discussed) of all\ncommunication media of the Union,\nand many more.\nA Union can very easily get lost, its leaders isolated,\nits stalwarts disillusioned, its members cynical and un-interested. The second term is traditionally a time for\nthis\u2014the involvement rate drops and it can be a case\nof writing out the elections to see what's going to happen next year. But here are ideas and ideals to fight for,\nand the need of an effort from the Union as a whole; the\nlike of which was only seen in my College time 4 years\nago when changes to Election of the President and\nSecretary by Union Ballot and many other concepts\nwere brought about.\nPerhaps the best way of fighting the Consultative\"\nDocument is to work to lay the basis for the Unions\nstrongest year ever in 1972-73. It's up to you to join in\n\u2014your participation is meaningful. Its essential. And if\nyou've any radical ideas\u2014come to the Union Office.\nBehind a wad of Green Papers the winds of change are\nstirring.\nSTART AT THE U GM TODAY.\nteens do) at their brother's early attempts at reading.\nIt was the great delight in actually being able to read\nthe first caption on the first page that really kindled my\nenthusiasm for reading, which meant that I was hardly\never seen without a book or magazine under my nose\nfor many years to come.\nI regret to say that I graduated to more sophisticated\ntastes rapidly, but having examined a recent copy of\nthe same comic, which seems hardly changed from\nwhen I first saw it 14 years ago, I remain convinced that\nit is the ideal start to a reading career. I would heartily\nrecommend it to anyone at college just beginning to\nread or wishing to use a refresher course.\nIf you are afraid of the effect that copies of 'Jack and\nJill' strewn about your room may have on visitors who\nhave already learnt their basic English and are up to\n'Eagle' or 'Mandy' standard, you could do worse than\ncounteract the effect by leaving a copy of 'Penthouse'\non display. Seldom have I seen the FELIX staff so excited as when I imported the review copy into the office,\nand a colleague informed me that, having placed the\nsame mag in a prominent position in his room, it becomes the focal point of the attentions of all his visitors.\nHaving exhausted the resources of the focal point (all\n11 pages of it) in the centre, and turning to the literary\ncontent, one finds a rather boring article on what the\nman in vogue should be wearing, driving and doing\nwith his spouse. The magazine is evidently written for\nmillionaire Casanovas (like me!\u2014Ed.). Buying the\nmagazine in the first place isn't cheap\u201435p. But perhaps it is worth it just for the classic selection of letters\nto the editor, of rather a different nature to those written to Felix, which you are certain to find there. In the\nlast issue these range from miniscule errors made in an\nearlier article on Hi-Fi to one from Japanese scientists\nengaged in measuring the length of stallions' sex\norgans (perhaps they're trying to mini atu rise them,\nnow!). I must finally mention the cartoons\u2014some\npeople must have a terribly gruesome sense of humour.\nIf, however, your tastes are more puritanical, perhaps\nyou had better try, if you haven't already (for \\ \\ million\ncopies are sold every month), the 'Reader's Digest',\nwritten by good Christians for good Christians. Yes, the\nR.D. A. are those people famous for their observance\nof mail-order Christian ethics. However, the excellence\nof their magazine cannot be doubted\u2014every issue a virgin example of the Jackdaw's art. Without doubt the\nhandiest-sized magazine around\u2014ideal for travelling\u2014\nand the safest to leave around when there are people\nat large, except for Country Life (to be reviewed in\narticle No. 4).\nWell, if you feel that I 've not been terribly original this\ntime, I promise to do better next.

If that blasted record is played once more, so\nhelp me I 'll ruin the machine\nsingle-handed. Huh! \"He drives\nthe fastest milk-cart in the\nWest . . .\" OK, these things do\nget a hold on your mind, but I can't stand that tune. It's a mad\nworld when you see the kind of\nstuff that gets to Number One; I wish I had the chance to make a few records and cash in on the\n'We Buy Anything' fans.\nCome to that, I would fancy a job of some kind in any case.\nBut what on earth . . .? Guess\nit's time I ransacked this list of\nopportunities from the Careers\nOffice.\nPretty grim reading really.\nThe ones that sound good take\ntwo people a year, and you have\nto be some kind of Einstein to\nget through the batteries of testing they give you. Like putting\nyou for the weekend with a pile\nof clean-faced Earnest Young\nMen (all of whom know the\nnames of the entire Board of\nDirectors) and giving you some\nappalling initiative test to see\nwho \"emerges as the natural\nleader\" (having massacred the\nothers).\nThe other firms, where they\ntake on hundreds and you're\njust another mouse on an everlasting treadmill\u2014I can just see\nmyself opting in for that! Good\ngrief, you spend your schooldays in a miserable terror of\nexams, then you rush/stagger/\nexist through university, and this\nis the outcome?\nWell then, what else is there?\nHere we are at the end of the\nlist, in the dregs of VSO and the\nlike. Dave was raving on about\nthem, wanted me to go to some\ntalk a bod from their HQ gave\nlast week, but . . . I ask you!\nVisions of more Clean and\nHarmless Young People. Mind\nyou, they did send old Larry\nto East Africa, and a weirder\ncharacter I 've yet to meet. Apparently he's doing incredible\nthings in some remote school,\nwhere he had to help build his\nown science lab before he got\ngoing. On the other hand, he's Head of Department, so his dic-tat or like instincts are being ful-filled.\nCome to that, I suppose I \u2022 Il is Sffiitlfi\nknow quite a few idiots who've\ngone on VSO\u2014and even re-turned. There was Sheila, who\ntrundled off to some place near\nMalaysia. She fancied she knew\nall about it, and nearly collapsed\nwhen she found there were skyscrapers and bigger cars than\nback home in her own town.\nSeems they'd got the outward\nsigns of development, but were\nstill crying out for teachers and\ntechnical assistance so they\ncould cope with it all.\nAnd there was that bore Todd.\nApplied without telling anyone,\nwent off to the West Indies, and\nsuddenly became so mate y, writing letters to everyone about\nthe wonderful time he was ha v ing, how it was Paradise. Worst\nof it was, none of us could contradict him: it's not easy to hitch\ndown there\u2014worse still, he was\nprobably right.\nI don't know. VSO seems to\nhave a funny effect on some\npeople. Like Jane. Went to some\nIndian college, helping to train\nlocal teachers for secondary\nschools. When someone is\nshooting their mouth off about\nthe Latest (and Greatest)\nCause, she never says much,\njust looks at them, dead cool.\nBut hear her describe the things\nshe's seen\u2014it brings the Third\nWorld bit right into focus. And,\non the other hand, she knows\nso much about the beautiful\nside of India. I reckon she really\ncares; she says she'll go back\nsome day. Meantime she wants\nto teach in an immigrant area\nin Britain when she's done her\nCert. Ed. Hardly a soft option,\nbut she certainly seems keen.\nCourse, Jeff was ranting on\nabout VSO propping up neo-im-peri a lists and neo-capitalists\nand what have you to Dave in\nthe bar last Tuesday. Wonder if\nhe's right? No joke if they are,\nwhen they've got fifteen hundred leaping around in the developing countries. What was\nDave's line? Oh yes, he said\nthat it would be a lot harder\nfor any politician to take in anyone when people became edu-cate d, and that in fact every\nVSO was teaching something,\nwhether a subject or a skill. On\nbalance I think Dave's right. You\ncan't keep education back from\npeople on the grounds that their\nhappier without it, either. If that\nwas true we'd still be ruled by\nthe First Anglo-Saxon Party of\nMercia.\nMust be snags though. I suppose they don't blaze them\naround their advertising (pretty\nsilly if they did). Must be no\njoke when you're teaching something to '0' level, and there\naren't enough books or equipment to go round. Or if you're a medic and you just can't get the\nmedicines you know are vital.\nWhat happens if you want to\ncome home? I suppose they fly\nyou back if something awful\nhappens but I guess VSO aren't crazy enough to arrange luxury\nflights every time the girl-friend\nmisses your wit, charm, sophistication, humour.\nMmm . . . The employers of\nBritain don't look to be falling\ninto queues for the pleasure of\nmy company just at present, so\nmaybe I 'll sample some foreign\nshore and see how they feel\nabout it in a year or two. From\nthis blurb it seems VSO are keen\nfor applications: I suppose I might enjoy teaching overseas.\nLet's see, Dave said you just fill\nup an application form, and\nBob's your uncle\u2014or a untie, depending\u2014there you are at an\ninterview.\nOh well, if they accepted him,\nmaybe they'll even give a thick-accented, non-polo-playing,\natheistic aly ob bo like me a chance! Now where are those\ndamned forms?\nJohny Silvo at IC\nor Find the Audience\nWith the union upper\nre fec. packed by a capacity crowd of about forty,\nJohnny Silvo and Dave\nMoses gave their sixth or\nseventh performance at IC\nFolk Song Club. At previous appearances of this\npair, the upper re fec. has\nbeen truly crowded so why\nthe change?\nThe evening started off\nwith floor players, and\nthese were quite competent traditional folk song\nsingers, but nothing special. Johnny Silvo and\nDave Moses came on to a round of applause that\nwould have been tumultuous had there been more\nto applaud. Starting off\nwith their usual sort of\nmusic which is good for a crowded folk club with\nNewky Brown flowing, but\nafter three or four numbers of the usual routine\nthey changed to mainly\nblues numbers and this is\nwhat these two are very\ngood at.\nJohnny Silvo is a competent guitarist while, to\nmy mind, Dave Moses is an\nexcellent bassist. Some of\nthe blues numbers that\nflowed off the guitar, bass\nand voices of this pair\nwould have brought a typical Saturday night ENTS.\nconcert crowd to its feet.\nNotwithstanding that, the\nmusic was flowing well before the interval, and after\nfive minutes of general\nchat, or whatever people\ndo in intervals, the floor\nplayers were back on. A free bonus was the joining together of Brillo and\ntwo other players whose\nnames elude me. Johnny\nSilvo and Dave Moses\njoined with Brillo (incidentally he is bassist with\nDiz Dizley) and there followed an incredible session with two bassists, one\nguitar and one voice for\nmost of the time, except\nfor a period with just two\nbassists. Superb.\nCAMPHEBRIDEAN\nSTYLE\nFor over ten years this society\nhas run expeditions to the\nHebrides or Western Isles off the\nWest Coast of Scotland. These\nare camping expeditions held\nduring the summer vacation.\nFor the scientifically minded\n\u2014if there are any at this College\n\u2014the Hebrides offer much\nscope for zoology, botany, marine biology, ornithology (etc.!),\ngeology, and other 'o logie s and\n'o graph ies too numerous to\nmention. Many rare species of\nthis, that and the other can be\nfound on some of the more remote islands, and it is the\nSociety's policy to visit these\nparts where possible. A typical\nexpedition camp-site is often\nseparated from the nearest road\nby ten miles of 2000 ft. mountains with no footpath leading\nto it; and thus access at the\nstart of an expedition when the\nstores have to be transported\nis usually by boat. However it\nhas been known for an expedition to carry its several tons of\nstores a few miles in pouring\nrain.\nDO IT AT NIGHT\nFor the more adventurous,\nHebridean h iN s, although rarely\nexceeding 2000 ft., offer quite\ngood climbing: sea cliffs are\nnotoriously difficult. An increasingly popular pastime nowadays is \"survival\". This is difficult to define precisely; basic-ally, what it involves is trekking\nout of camp in the middle of the\nnight\u2014when everyone else is\nenjoying a sing-song and cocoa\nin front of a camp fire\u2014and\nbivouacking in a lonely mountain\npass. Such madness is usually\npursued by groups of four in\nadverse weather conditions.\nSome parts of the Hebrides are\namong the wettest in Britain;\nwhile others only a few miles\naway are among the driest. Such\ncontrasts in weather and scenery give islands much of their\ncharacter, which makes returning to them year by year irresistible. DO-IT-YOURSELF\nCommunity life on these expeditions has a character all of\nits own, as you will find out if\nyou come on an expedition. The\ncharacter of an expedition is\nmade by the people themselves,\nbringing what they can offer.\nWhen one is so far from civilisation entertainment must be\nhome-made, and the success of\nmany S.H. S. expeditions has\nbeen a great attribute to members in creating their own enter-tain ment. Even the technical\naspects of project work have\u2014\nbelieve it or not\u2014been a source\nof entertainment in one way or\nanother.\nDO IT IN THE DARK\nOf course, not all expeditions\nare to the middle of nowhere. A major project on some expeditions to more civilized parts has\nbeen sociology, and in this field\nthe project work and entertainment overlap in a completely different manner. During the day a group of shabbily dressed young\nmen received cups of tea from\nvillagers, and in the evening\nthey went to a Ceiledh in the\nchurch hall. Hebridean culture\nhas not been very extensively\nsurveyed, and so one is to some\nextent exploring the unknown.\nDIG IT\nThis summer, the Society\nshould run five expeditions. The\nexpedition to South Uist, how-ever, is under subscribed; so\nnew members will be especially\nwelcome on this expedition.\nAdded to that the Society proposes to continue an archaeological project begun in 1970.\nThe site was discovered by the\nSociety on a schoolboys' expedition some years ago.\nDO IT NOW\nJoining the Society is very\nsimple: one just writes to the\nsecretary to obtain an application form. The rest is self-ex-plan a tory. If over nineteen, students at I.C. are eligible to go as\nOfficer on any expedition in\n1972; and as officers they do hot\nhave to pay for anything over\nand above their own travelling\nexpenses. (Junior Officer pay\nhalf-rate). An Officer's task is to\nco-ordinate a project, carried\nout by schoolboys and generally\nlook after\u2014that cannot be the\nright expr e sion( No, it's not\u2014\nSubed.)\u2014the boys; though on\nsenior expeditions the boys look\nafter themselves (!!). Certain\nofficers have more specific tasks\nsuch as travel officer or camp\nadministrator; and one cannot\nforget the leader.\nIT'S FOR YOU\nPeople who have been on\nS.H. S. Expeditions have come\nback saying how much they\nhave enjoyed themselves. (On\nthe other hand, they have come\nback saying . . .\u2014Subed). Now\nalthough we are desperately\nshort of members, we do want\nthe right sort of people to join\n\u2014people who enjoy it a bit, who\nenjoy the camp atmosphere, and\ncan be reasonably self-reliant. I know that such people exist at\nImperial College, because the\ncollege has its own expeditions.\nInterested parties should apply\nas soon as posible: it is never\ntoo early, and sometimes too\nlate.\nSecretary: J.D.

Hob man Victim of\npetty \u2014\nmindedness within Union Executive\nAt today's Union meeting a motion of no-confidence\nin the Hon. Secretary, D. Hobman is going to be put\nbefore you. The events leading up to this typify the\nworst possible breakdown in communications between\nUnion officials.\nIt all started last term\nwhen Dave Hobman, in\nline with Union policy,\nwent to see a flat in Cambridge Gardens (South\nKensington) with a view to\nusing it for student accommodation as are the\nRavenscourt flats at the\nmoment.\nAfter a preliminary survey it was decided to buy\nit although it needed a lot\nof work done, including\ntwo new toilets. The\nbuilders contracted for the\njob said that it would\nbe ready in time for the\nSpring Term. It would then\nbe able to house seven\npeople.\nThe flat was advertised\non the Union notice board\nat the beginning of term\nand he told everyone\nwhom he thought might be\ninterested. Very little response was forthcoming\nand so when his girlfriend\nand two of her friends\nexpressed interest, he\noffered them 3 of the 7\navailable places. At the\ntime they were in intercollegiate halls of residence at University College and not liking it.\nHowever, on going to look\nat the flat they found it had\nnot been finished and\nsince they had given\nnotice to leave their halls,\nthe net result was nowhere\nto go.\nDave then managed to\nget the College to put\nthem up for a week or two\nwhile the redecorating\nwas finished. At this time,\nhe had to go to France for\na conference lasting a week during which time\nJohn McCullough advertised the remaining places\nin IC News. Up till now\nonly one more person has\nsaid he might want to live\nat the flat and so three\nplaces are still vacant.\nOn Monday of last week\nhe spoke to Brian Darling\nabout this and got the impression that everything\nhad been made clear.\nHowever, this was not the\ncase. Soon after this he\nwas presented with an\nultimatum by Brian Darling, Paul Jowett and Dave\nAmos which said 'We can\nwithdraw it if you like. If\nyou resign!' The 'it' being\nreferred to is a very violently worded motion\nwhich would have been\ntotally unjustified even if its\nsupposed basis was true.\n'I.C.U. recognises that\nthe processes of allocation of the three places in\nthe Cambridge Gardens\nflat, before advertisement,\nleaves the Hon. Sec. open\nto allegations of corruption\nof the gravest nature. Such\nalleged abuses of a position should be exposed\nfirstly, and if proven, the\nrequisite action taken. In\nthis particular case this\ndemands the resignation\nof the Hon. Sec. and the\nremoval of the persons\nfrom the flat, who gained\ntheir occupancy by gross\ncorruption.'\nIt apparently took Dave\nHobman two days before\nhe could find anyone to\ntalk to about the issue and\ntales that he and Dave\nAmos would not be seen\nin the same office together\nare probably to be be liev ed. After he finally got\nthrough to Dave Amos, the\nlatter agreed that the proceedings were unjustified\nand said he would try to\nprevent the motion being\nput to the meeting.\nWhat seems incomprehensible to me is the fact\nthat three apparently responsible members of the\nI.C.U. council should actually get this far without\nasking the 'accused' what\nhe had to say about it.\nIt highlights the worst\naspects of Union 'petty\nmindedness' just at a time\nwhen people are wondering what we have a Union\nfor anyway. If we must\nhave a group of people\nwhich supposedly represents us then the least we\ncan expect is that they behave responsibly.\nCheshire\nChat On Thursday of last\nweek, Group Captain Leonard Cheshire spoke to an\nAssociated Studies group\non the subject of suffering.\nLeonard Cheshire served in the RAF during\nWorld War II and at the age\nof 28 was the official British observer at the dropping of the atom bomb at\nNagasaki. He retired from\nthe RAF the following year,\nsince when he has been\nengaged in the setting up\nand running of homes for\nthe adult disabled. There\nare now about 100 Cheshire homes both in the\nUK and abroad.\nThe speaker commented\non the role of those who\nsuffer and that however\nwe help such people, their\ndignity, freedom and individuality must always be\nrespected. He remarked\nthat some people suffering\nchronic physical disability\nwere, under the NHS,\ndoomed to an existence in\nthe geriatric wards of our\nhospitals. However, those\nand all who must suffer\nstill have the same basic\nhopes and desires for life\nand resent their loss of\nindependence and still\nneed to mix in society.\nGroup Captain Cheshire\nwent on to say that in\nhelping others, we often\ngive materially, but in return we receive spiritually\nthrough the example of\nthose who must endure\nsuffering. They have realized that they must accept\ntheir situation and come to\nterms with it.\nThe point was made that\nit was the individual who\nwas all important and\ncould and would change\nthe world by doing what\nwas within his power to\nmake the world a little better for someone else.\nWhen questioned about\nNagasaki, he considered\nthe circumstances, if any\nin which the use of force\nis justified. He said that\nthere was sometimes no\noption. His conditions were\nthat there must be no\nalternatives, that the minimum of forces should be\nemployed and that the\nultimate good of all mankind should be at the\nheart of its use. In 1945, to\nend the war the alternatives were the invasion of\nJapan by the Allied forces\nin which at least 3 million\nlives would have been lost\nor the use of an atomic\nbomb. The speaker supported the second choice\nbut regretted that it had\nkilled so many when it\ncould have been dropped\nin the country or the sea\nas a warning. The present\nbuild up of nuclear weapons despite its obvious\nun desire ability did however bring about a certain\nsurge of responsibility in\nthose who held them.\n\n"

    "content": "Thursday, 10th February, 1972 FELIX Page 3\neditorial\nIf you have seen the\nfront page of this issue\nyou may think that our\nmain headline is a little\nunfair to the Union executive. Perhaps as far as\nmost of them are concerned it is. There is however\nno doubt that as far as the\nfew people involved in\nproposing this stupid\nmotion are concerned, we\nhave shown too much\nkindness by far. Anybody\nwho had had any close\nassociation with the Union\noffice will know the petty\nminded, bickering which\nhas been going on now for\nquite some time between\ntwo leading members of\nthe executive. It is not surprising that a crisis such\nas this, has occurred because of lack of communication (their excuse not\nours) when these two\npeople have for a time refused to be in the same\nroom together. Surely anyone who intends to stand\nfor a Union position should\nbe sufficiently responsible\nto realise that even if they\nare not in love with other\nelected officials of the\nUnion they have a duty to\nthe Union to get on with\nthem or resign.\nOne of less pleasant\naspects of being editor of\nthis newspaper is that in\nthe past week no less than\nthree, fairly well substantiated allegations of gross\ncorruption amongst Union\nmembers and certain staff\nmembers have reached my\nears. It is not my job to\ninvestigate or bring to justice the people involved,\nthough it is my responsibility to do something\nabout it, just as it is the\nresponsibility of every\nmember of the Union to\nensure that their money is\nnot being misused or falling into the wrong hands.\nI am pleased to say that\ntwo of the allegations I have been able to clear up\nwith very little fuss or un-pleasantness. Unfortunately one remains. There\nare a few people in this\ncollege who I do not wish\nto name, who are convinced that the recent robbery of Ents. funds was not\nthe unfortunate incident it\nappeared at the time, but\na pre-planned theft by a few people directly involved in Ents affairs. It is a great pity that this extremely serious matter\nshould cast gloom over\nthe whole of the Entertainments committee at a time when their new found\nsuccess should bring them\nall the credit they deserve,\nespecially as most of them\nprobably have nothing at\nall to do with this sordid\naffair. I can therefore only\nask anyone who knows\nanything about this robbery to come forward and\nsay so, so as the culprits\nif indeed there are any,\ncan be found and at least\nthe money recovered. If\nthe criminals are not pre\npared to confess then\nfeel that the Union officials\nhave a responsibility to\ninvestigate the matter fur\nther if only to convince us\nthat the robbery was gen u ine and not, as many\npeople excluding myself\nbelieve, 'a put-up job'. If\nthe Union officials will not\ndo this of their own accord\nthen they should be man\ndated to do so by their\nUnion.\nwhat's on\nHOBMAN\ndespairs\nStudent Unions will never be\nthe most popular organisations\nbut neither should they have the\nreputation that they seem to\nhave at the moment. Perhaps\nthe trouble stems from within\nthe organisation itself, perhaps\nit's our fault that our organisations are so rotten, hope that\nthis is the situation because\nthis is the only area that we can\never usefully influence.\nAre student unions merely a playground for would-be politicians and bureaucratically minded demi-gods who seek only to\nbully the student sheep? I don't think so. If it is the case then\nI 've had enough. I want no\nmore to do with it. Most 'con-s cio us' students must surely\nhave a loathing and a contempt\nfor the life that they are being\ntrained to lead when they leave\nthe college factory. Surely they\nmust realise the corruptness of\nindustry, surely they must realise the selfishness necessary,\nthe striving to carve one's own\nniche in society, surely they\nmust . . . . But alas, they don't. Otherwise they would come forward and form a society, a union\nto help others and to try and\nequalise the burden of unfairness that so many people seem\nto suffer from.\nOh yes, it's easy to criticise.\nI 've done it so many times. Yet\nhow hard it is to create. How\nhard it is to make something out\nof a union. How hard it is to\nspend \u00a333,000. Isn't is difficult\nto sit through 1\\ hours (again)\nof council trivia while remaining\nsane. Did I say trivia . . .?\nObviously thinking of buying a new glider is trivia, naturally\nno one really wants to change\nthe structure within the union,\nnaturally no one is interested\nwhere the student councillor\nshould go. (You've never heard\nof her\u2014well of course you\nhaven't, because there aren't any\ncommunications in this place).\nLet everyone go mad. No one\ncares any more. Cleaners arrive\nevery morning at 9.00 in blue\nplastic macs, kick the bird out of\nbed (sorry there aren't any\nwomen in this place and anyway\nthey embarrass the other residents on the landing when they\ncome out of the shower in the\nmorning, so that's not allowed).\nLecturers arrive at 9.30 and still\nthe labs go on, still the spools\non the computer turn. Little\nfluorescent stickers say lights\nout, spring thing, SUK . . . FUCK.\nOh why do we bother, why\ndo we care, what are Union\nmeetings, what is council, why\ndon't we just do it all ourselves?\nAre we frightened just to cio\nwhat we want or is there some\nmistaken belief that perhaps\nsomeone somewhere else would\nlike a say in what happens. Do\npeople take any notice any\nmore?\nWhat does it really need to\nmake people notice? Surely we\nstill don't need a gimmick, surely we don't have to make it in-te resting? For probably the one\ntime in your life you can actually achieve something. This is\nprobably the only time you'll be\nable to stand up and shout:\n'I don't agree' and find support,\nfind an opportunity to be an\nequal.\nOh please believe, don't leave\nus, we need you, without you\nwe are nothing, without you we\ndon't exist, without you there is\nonly the Imperial College .. .\nYours faithfully,\nDAVE HOBMAN\n(Hon. Sec. I.C.U.). hi-fi-soc\non record\nDear Sir,\nThe Christmas issue of Felix\ncarried a feature on Hi-Fi. The\nImperial College Hi-Fi Society\nwould like it to be made known\nthat the article was not submitted by any of its members, and\ndoes not necessarily express\nour views.\nWhilst we commend the basis\nof the article, we feel that it\nmay be rather misleading to the\nnovice, since it contains some\nrather obvious errors and inaccurate descriptions. For ex-ample, one cannot purchase a good stereo tuner for less than\nabout \u00a360. Furthermore, it is\nuntrue to state that no further\nexpenditure is needed, having\nbought your tuner and aerial.\nNot much sound emanates from\na ph ono plug!\nNoise is inherent in any electrical system, and in any amplifier worthy of the 'Hi-Fi' label\nit is not caused by poor quality\ncomponents or bad connections\nbut is determined by the design\nof the circuit. Wow and flutter\nis rarely more than 0.1% in the\ncheapest turntables, and should\npreferably be of the order of\n0-05%. The author of the Christmas article suggests that 0.5%\nis adequate.\nThe paragraph about frequency response is completely\nincomprehensible. We suggest\nthat whilst a response of 30 Hz\nto 17kHz( \u00b1 5 dB) might be\nadequate for a loudspeaker, the\nfrequency response of an amplifier should be better than 20\nHz to 20 kHz (\u00b1 2dB). It is extremely dangerous to\ntake distortion figures seriously\nunless full qualification is given\nAs an example, a stereo amplifier which meets the author's specification of less than 0.05%\ndistortion (at all powers up to\nrated output, and at all frequencies within the audio bandwidth)\nwould cost at least \u00a3200 excluding pre amplifier. We feel that the author is misguided in categorizing Hi-Fi\nequipment according to price,\nas this often has no bearing on\nits quality, which is a more\nsuitable criterion. Moreover, at\nthe time the Christmas article\nappeared in Felix, the following\nrecommended units were no\nlonger being manufactured:\nGoddmans Maxim, KEF Concord, and Leak Sandwich loud-speakers, and the Leak Stereo\n70 amplifier. Some of the others\nrecommended were, in our op in ion, of doubtful quality and/or\noutdated design, e.g., Goldring\nGL69 deck and Shure M44E\ncartridge.\nIt is beyond the scope of this\nletter to give our own equipment recommendations, but we\nhope that if any reader wants\nfurther information or advice,\nthey will join Hi-Fi Soc, and\navail themselves of the extra discount on new equipment which\nis obtainable for members.\nYours faithfully,\nfor\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE HI-FI\nSOCIETY,\nPhilip Swift (President),\nPeter Clarke (Hon.

    "content": "Page 8 FELIX Thursday, 10th February, 1972\nStudent Counselling Service The Student Counselling Service has appeared to fill a gap\nin the College system of student health and welfare.\nOriginally, problems which\nthe personal tutor considered\ntoo complex for them to handle\nwere referred to the Health Centre for treatment by a qualified\npsychiatrist. However, a great\nmany of the cases involved were\nnot serious enough to need proper psychiatric aid and so valuable time was being wasted.\nIn about 1969 this deficiency\nin the system was re cog is ed but\nit still took eighteen months and\ngrowing concern by the student\nbody of the Medical Services\nCommittee before this was\nremedied with the introduction\nof a Student Counsellor. Originally, provision was made for this\npost to be part-time although it\nwas seen that the possibility of\nthe job becoming full-time\nshould be taken into account.\nWith these aims in mind Mrs.\nBonny Hartnett was asked to\nset up the service in January\n1971, working at IC for three\ndays a week. She graduated\nfrom Melbourne University in\n1966 with aB.A. and Diploma of\nSocial Studies. After a year as\na social worker in Australia she\ndecided to go abroad, first to\nItaly, where six months were\nspent teaching English. Eventually after a year or so of living\non the continent she moved to\nEngland and then back to Australia. It was while working as\na student counsellor there that\nshe got married and subsequently returned to England so\nthat her husband could do postgraduate work. This raised background makes her ideally suited\nfor a job which requires great\nunderstanding and the ability to\ncommunicate easily with students needing help.\nThe service is there quite\nsimply to help with any problems a student may have, i.e. with personal problems (relationships with families, sexual\nproblems, anxiety, depression,\netc.), and more academic matters such as fear of failure, loss\nof motivation, anxiety about\nexams and work.\nMrs Bonny\nHartnett\nEach appointment is normally\none hour long and on average\na case might take about seven\nor eight weeks with one session\nper week. It is taken for granted\nthat all these are strictly confidential and so anyone who\nmight be worried about information leaking back to their department need not be con-cern ed. In fact this system provides the security which might\nbe felt lacking in a personal\ntutor who may have to mark\nexamination papers. Although\nhe is unlikely to deliberately distort the results the possibility is\nalways there.\nAn analysis of the number of\npeople using the service shows\nthat about 40 per cent are self-referred. This is increasing as\nmore and more people hear of\nits existence. The first year saw\nabout 120 people either being\nreferred or coming themselves\nfor help and it will soon be necessary for the job to become\nfull-time if justice is to be done\nto the individual cases.\nDiscussion groups are organised in the different departments\nat which personal tutors ask for\nhelp in dealing with difficult\ncases. These are a comparatively new features and appear\nto be successful. A weekly meeting of senior tutors, Mrs. Hartnett and Dr. Agnes Wilkinson, ap syco therapist from L.S.E., discusses more general problems\nand ways of solving them. It is\nhoped that these will increase\nthe number of students referred\nbefore it is too late for anything\nto be done. Quite often, the\nreferred only comes when the\ndecision to withdraw someone\nfrom a course has been taken.\nHence all that can be done is to\nprepare the person for leaving\nthe University. This is clearly\nunsatisfactory.\nPlans for the future include\nan active involvement in the\nUnion's student advisory service\nwhich is currently being con-side red. There is also the possibility that independence from\nthe Health department could\noccur, this is unlikely at the\npresent.\nFor anyone who feels they\nmight like to talk over anything\nthat is worrying them, even if\nthey don't really know what it is\nthemselves, Mrs. Hartnett is\navailable from 10 a.m.5 p.m. on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. It is best to make an\nappointment but 2.30 - 3.30 p.m. each day is set aside for anyone to come without a previous\narrangement.\nRCSA Careers\nBrains Trust 72\nThe RCS A held a Careers Brains Trust meeting in South Side Senior\nCommon Room on Thursday, 20th January. About\n165 people were present,\nthe vast majority being 2nd and 3rd year RCS students\nattracted not only by free\nbeer and food but also, we\nhope, out of interest.\nA panel of men in industry and a science teacher\nwere invited to answer the\nquestions \" How should a candidate prepare him or\nherself for interview?\", \" A career in science and\ntechnology or management\u2014is there a choice, or\nare they the same thing?\",\n\"Should one join a small\nfirm or a large one?\", \"Is\nscience teaching a satisfactory and satisfying\ncareer for the science gra-duat e?\". Supplementary questions were put from the\nfloor and a lively discussion was held, the panel\nnot always appearing to\nagree among itself. However, when the points of\ndisagreement were analysed it was found that\napparently diverging views\nwere the result of different\napproaches to the question and different aspects\nof it being answered, a fault not uncommon among\nexamine es at finals!\nThis kind of function has\nalways proved very pop u lar. The Association does\nnot set itself up as an appointments board or a labour exchange, as these\nfunctions are already and\nproperly carried out else-where. We have, however,\ntwo commodities in abundance and are happy to\ngive them away. They are\nexperience and advice,\nbut these can only help the\nfresh graduate to make up\nhis or her own mind. We\ncan also supply information concerning careers in\na wide variety of industries\nand professions, and can\nput students in touch with\npeople already in industry.\nIf there is any way in\nwhich you think the Association can help you, then\nplease call and see Miss\nPurnell in Room 310, College Block \u2014 you might\neven get a cup of coffee!\nFinally, to all 3rd year students \u2014 please don't forget to join us before you\nleave College. You should\nhave received application\nforms etc. last December,\nbut if you have lost them\ncome to Room 310 and\nsign on \u2014 plus your \u00a31 of\ncourse.\nOsibisa\nNo Osibisa concerts can\nbe unexceptional but few\nof their concerts can have\nbeen as memorable as the\none in the Great Hall. It\nstarted off fairly innocuously by Osibisa standards\n(i.e. audiences on their\nfeet by the second num-ber), I wonder if they too\nare getting blas e about\naudience reaction (see\nRory Gallagher). But then\nthey always have been\nrather proud of their\n\"Criss-Cross Rhythms that\nexplode with happiness\"\n(Sounds pretentious unless enunciated with a West African accent).\nOnly the thing is, that's just what Osibisa are\nabout, happiness, and\nwhat better manifestation\nof multi-racial happiness\ncould there be than two\nNewcastle Brown bottles\nbeing bashed in time to\nAfrican drums. The audience could have stamped\nand bashed and chanted\n\"O SI-BI-SA\" all night and\nstill gone home happy, but\nwhat a fine band they are\nmusically \u2014 with Teddy\nOsei's flute hovering like\na hummingbird, and Wendell Richardson's almost\nHendrix-style guitar. A pastiche of such diverse elements might prove unpleasant but Osibisa prove\notherwise. I think the P.A. system could be improved\na bit so that some instruments, in particular the\ntrumpet of Mac Tontoh\ncould be heard a bit better.\nStill, it's the percussion\nthat gets the crowd on\ntheir feet, and the general\nbouncy atmosphere dwarfed that of the previous week. When, just before the official last number it was announced that\nStevie Wonder had arrived\nand was on stage, the\naudience response had to\nbe heard to be believed. I wonder how many of the\naudience had previously\nthought of him as an inept\nteeny bopper. He took over\non drums in a phenomenal\njam session with Osibisa\nand showed what a heavy\ntechnique he had. He has\ncertainly moved forward\nfrom Top of the Pops and\nthe Tony Blackburn show.\nAll this too after a certain\nEnts treasurer, who shall\nremain nameless, had made him pay admission\nbecause he didn't recognize him. So Stevie Wonder joins Johnny Winter on\nthe list of \"distinguished\nI.C. Ents Guests\".\nRory Gallagher\nAfter this concert it was\nremarked with regret that\nthe Blues Club had passed\naway when it was obvious\nthat there is still a great\ndeal of interest in the\nBlues, even when it's played by the bloated children of capitalism. Rory\nGallagher doesn't really\ncome into this category\nbut his music is much\nmore acceptable on a mass scale than the music\nof Bukka White or Robert\nJohnson, whose influences\nare evident in his music.\nWhenever he played a blues number the audience\nwent wild, and the same\nhappened the previous\nweek with both Philip\nGoohand-Tait and Linda\nLewis. Someone should\nrestart the Blues Club and\nmake Rory Gallagher its\nhonorary president, or my\nname's not Blind Howlin'\nSonny Blues Boy Peg Leg\nBig Fat Pig Meat Jelly Roll\nAmor the Original One\nMan Delta Blues Band.\nBut now to the concert,\nand what can I add to the\nreview of \"Deuce\". After\nall, Rory gave the thumbs\nup sign a lot and stomped\nabout incessantly. In fact\nevery time he stomped too\nmuch the audience rushed\nthe stage, so he had to be\ncareful. The reaction was\ndeserved of course but it\nshould not pale the music\ninto insignificance. A nice\nbalance of old and new,\nwith \"Messin with The\nKid\" the pick of the new\nsongs and the prize for the\nmost shouted-for song of\nthe evening going to \"Sin-ner Boy\" from the first\nalbum. I wonder if he gets\na reaction like this every\nnight. It's surprising he\ndoesn't get swollen headed with the adulation\nhe is subjected to, but he\nmade a bow at the end of\nevery number and gave\nprofuse thanks at the end\nof the evening, \"Look after\nyourselves\", etc. Nice one.\nGood Habit opened the\nshow, all dressed up as\nmonks in their good habits. The music was\nquite good, the lyrics a bit\nartificial perhaps, and between the numbers they\ndid try a bit too hard to\nbe childish. I mean, being\nchildish comes naturally,\ndoesn't it? My teddy says\nso, and he knows.\nCONTRACEPTIVES\nDUREX\nGossamer 43p dozen\nNuform 58p dozen\nFetherlite 58p dozen\nPOST FREE from :\nPOSTVENDOR\n9 Fairburn Drive\nGarforth\nLeeds LS25 2AR "

The weather has\ncaused two further cancellations and it looks as if an\n'important' fixture of the opposition will cause more\ndelay.\nThe Football Club successfully played their games\nwith the 2nd,3 rd and 4th Xl's all progressing to the\nsemi-final of the Reserve Cup. The Vth XI was knocked\nout early on and let in Goldsmith's II to make up the\nnecessary four. However the 1st XI were foolish\nenough to only draw their game with Thames 1-1, being somewhat fortunate to get level with a late goal.\nAgain the Gods have forced the replay to be delayed.\nThe Ladies Hockey have not been able to play a single game since Christmas hence the absence of\nany reports.\nUnfortunately, this term has seen a number of fixture 'cock tips' which, except for one, have been attributable to the opposition. The exception was a side\ncoming to Harlington to play the extra XV s at rugby\nonly to find our side in Guildford. IC suffered in the\nform of the football 1st and 4th Xl's when the opposition failed to appear. It was annoying for the 4th' s when\nthey had 11 men and a referee on a freezing cold\npitch in Raynes Park only to discover later that the\ngame had ben called off on the Friday. Finally, of the\nknown cases, a game of rugby was lucky enough to\nhave two referees.\nThe incidents have been mentioned flippantly but it\nis infuriating to at least one of the parties concerned;\nespecially as it only takes a few well placed 'phone\ncalls to call a game off. The record of IC clubs over\nthis matter has, this season, been very good and it is\nhopes that this continues. I am not sure how much\nthe cold weather has to do with other colleges flaking!\nThe Water Polo tournament, reported in the last\nFELIX, was a great success for IC, who finished second\nto Polytechnic, and beat ULU. The organisers were\nbitterly disappointed at the lack of support considering\nthe easy accessibility of the swimming pool.\nA question is raised here of whether the standards of\nIC sport are better than ULU and I know a few clubs\nwho would fancy their chances against UL U. Apologies must be tendered to the 2nd XI football\nfor not having a report on their performances, but they\nare so boring to write about since they always win!\nThe IC Swimming and\nWater-Polo Club would\nlike to thank the few students who bothered to turn\nup to watch some of the\ngames in the international\ntournament a few weeks\nago. To say we were disappointed not to see more\nof you over there would be\nan understatement. We\nappreciate that not all\nthose who turned up are\nnow sold on the sport but\nat least they took the\ntrouble to find out at first\nhand just what it is all\nabout.\nAs far as the tournament\nwent, I think it would be\nfair to state that everyone\nenjoyed it, spectators and\nplayers.\nThe final table of results\nis shown below:\u2014\np wDL Pos.\nP 'technic 4 4 0 0 1\nIC 4 3 0 1 2\nUL 4 1 1 2 3\nPenguin 4 1 1 2 3\nCologne 4 0 0 4 5\nAs expected, Polytechnic\nwon all their games, even\nin the absence of a few\nof their best players who\nhad to miss the last two\nOn Saturday, 29th of\nJanuary, IC 1st XV entertained Old Guildfordians\n1st XV at Harlington; IC\nrunning out winners by 18\npoints to 8.\nThe bitterly cold weather made handling difficult\nand the game became\nrather scrappy at times.\nIC won the toss and elected to play against the wind\nin the first half. Guildfordians opened the scoring\nwith a try after about 10\nminutes, after pressing\nhard in the IC '25'. Then\nsome slack play by the IC\ndefence (the culprit shall\nremain nameless) allowed\nGuildfordians to score a further try in the corner to\nmake the score 8 points to\nnil. This setback made the\nIC team play harder and\nthe margin was reduced\nwhen John Mcdonough\nmade amends with a good\ntry after a passing movement in the Guildfordians\nhalf. A penalty kick by\nDave Rimmer made the\nscore 8-7 in Guildfordians\nfavour and only resolute\ndefensive work by IC prevented further score before half time.\nJim Hunt ran 50 yards\nfor a good try soon after\nevenings, being committed to training with the GB squad. Their strength, as\nusual, resided in their\nspeed of swimming and\noverall team strategy.\nNevertheless, IC gave\nthem a run for their money\nlosing by a score of 9-17.\nLike most team sports,\nwater-polo games cannot\nbe won by individual performances when the standard of play is high. However, two names should be\nmentioned: Peter McCartney and Cliff Spooner.\nPete was the key man in\nthe organising of our\noffence (he is also a member of Polytechnic) and\nCliff Spooner was the\nmain factor in organising\nthe overall team strategy\n(ex-Olympic GB player).\nBoth these players helped\nin giving the rest of the\nteam enough confidence in\ntheir playing ability to\nguarantee us the second\nposition.\nOur victory over the\nLondon University team\nwas probably the biggest\nupset of the tournament.\nBy winning, IC established\nthe re-start, to give IC the\nlead. Alan Roberts scored\na try and Dave Rimmer\nkicked another penalty to\nmake the final score 18-8\nto IC. But for poor handling by the IC backs (at-tri but able to the we a th er?!) and rather weak\ntackling by the team in\ngeneral, the IC score\nwould have been bigger.\nSome tightening up all\nround is needed before\nthe long awaited Gutteridge Cup match against\nGoldsmith's College. We\nhope to regain the services\nof the IC captain who\nshould get his 1st team\nplace back, after spending\na short while playing for\nthe A1's. On the same Saturday,\na rather drunken Ex 1st XV lost 3-4 to Old Guildfordians 2nd; the A1 XV\ndrew 9-9 with O.G.' s3 rd XV; and the celebrated B2\nXV annihilated the opposition (U.G.4 th)440.

Rhys.\nitself as one of the strongest university sides in the\ncountry (some would say\nthe strongest). To further\nboost our reputation, we\ndefeated the Penguin\nClub which came third last\nyear in the senior division\nof the country.\nAs far as Cologne is\nconcerned, we feel that\nthey thoroughly enjoyed\ntheir visit to this country\neven though they did not\nwin any matches. Their\nstandard of playing has decreased in the last two\nyears but remains at a very\nacceptable level. In fact,\nthey were not thrashed by\nany of the other teams\nsince the scores always indicated a close match.\nFurthermore they did win\nthe beer boat races held\nat our reception after the\ntournament.\nOur only hope, as a team, is that future tournaments will attract great\nnumbers and that more\npeople will get to know\nour sport. We sincerely\nhope that this tournament\nhas helped to lay the\nground work.\nCricket\nDuring this term the\nCricket Club will be practising at Gover's Indoor\nNets in readiness for the\ncoming season. At the\nstart of the term the attendance on a Sunday afternoon has dwindled but we\nhope that as many old\nlags and 'experienced'\nfresher s will appear on at\nleast one Sunday. For\nfresher s who have not yet\nbeen and hope to play during the summer then the\nnets provide ideal practice\nfor the perfect wickets that\nArthur prepares at Harlington. The committee\nhopes that as many people\nas possible will take advantage of these excellent\nfacilities\u2014meet 3.00 p.m. every Sunday.\nAll copy for the next\nissue to Chris Potter,\nsub-warden of Falmouth Hall, by Wednesday, 16th February\nat latest.\nThe 3rd XI is currently\nenjoying its most successful season for several\nyears.

The main reason\nfor this success has been\na keen, well-balanced side\nwith plenty of good res-erve s. Since Christmas we\nhave beaten QM C XI 3-2\nat home in a very close\ngame, the winner coming\nonly five minutes from\ntime (scorers A. Peterson,\nR. Smith, A. Hallard) and\nQM C III 3-2 away, despite\na brilliant glancing header\ninto his own goal from\nBob Gibson, leaving 'keep-er Reg (oops, there goes\nanother lob) Jinks with\nno chance at all. Scorers\n(at the right end) E. Neap,\nR. Smith, R. Day. The other\nnoteworthy success of the\nterm was a40 victory\nover Kings II in the cup.\nThe opposition decided to\ngive us a chance by only\nbringing nine players and\nwere duly punished for\nsuch impudence. Scorers\non this occasion were A. Lafferty, R. Smith, R. Gibson and I. Hyslop. But near\nmisses came from R. Day\n(about 15 of them).\nRegular players this season have been Bob Barley, Roy Jinks, Eddie\n(Clogger) Richards, Chris\nAccith, Ian Hyslop, Derek\n(Giraffe) Cash, Alan Wilkinson, Bill Lamion, Dave\nBennett, Alan Peterson,\nBob Gibson (capt.), Bob\nDay, Mike Knowles, Russ\nSmith, Ian McDermott and\nTony Hallard.\nNow that K.
